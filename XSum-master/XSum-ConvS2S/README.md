# Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Model for Extreme Summarization

This repository contains PyTorch code for the ConvS2S model from the EMNLP 2018 paper "[Don't Give Me the Details, Just the Summary! Topic-Aware Convolutional Neural Networks for Extreme Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08745)". Please contact me at shashi.narayan@ed.ac.uk for any question.

Our ConvS2S model is based on [Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03122). The original code from their paper can be found as a part of [Facebook AI Research Sequence-to-Sequence Toolkit](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq). Our ConvS2S code is based on an earlier copy of this toolkit. It uses optimized hyperparameters for extreme summarization. Our release facilitates the replication of our experiments, such as training from scratch or predicting with released pretrained models, as reported in the paper.
