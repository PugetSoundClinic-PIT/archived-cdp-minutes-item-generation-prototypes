# Topic-Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Model for Extreme Summarization

This repository contains PyTorch code for our Topic-ConvS2S model from the EMNLP 2018 paper "[Don't Give Me the Details, Just the Summary! Topic-Aware Convolutional Neural Networks for Extreme Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08745)". Please contact me at shashi.narayan@ed.ac.uk for any question.

Our Topic-ConvS2S model builds on an earlier copy of [Facebook AI Research Sequence-to-Sequence Toolkit](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq). 

Please see [here](https://github.com/shashiongithub/XSum/blob/master/README.md#topic-aware-convolutional-model-for-extreme-summarization) for further instructions.
