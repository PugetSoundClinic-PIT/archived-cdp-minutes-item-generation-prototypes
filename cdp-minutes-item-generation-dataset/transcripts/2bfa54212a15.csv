182,0.97,1221.62,1233.665,I am afraid to live in a city where we are more comfortable Cycling people through minutes the court then we are giving them a fighting chance to have a judge and jury hear about the circumstances that brought them there.,34,,
183,0.97,1233.665,1240.906,This summer we began a series with the role of police of the city.,34,,
184,0.97,1240.906,1245.277,Council members agreed that for too long police have been asked to deal with social issues including poverty and mental health struggles.,34,,
185,0.97,1245.277,1246.545,They are badly equipped to handle.,34,,
186,0.97,1246.545,1258.957,We ask you to support amending the Miscible code so that people rested by police for the very issues can also make the case to a judge and jury that the struggles do not belong in the criminal system.,34,,

194,0.97,1296.128,1297.796,They are asking for people to be held accountable.,36,,
195,0.97,1297.796,1307.506,You can imagine the frustration that now a proposal is being made to Decriminalize crime and further take away protections for people that the laws were created for.,36,,
196,0.97,1307.506,1319.885,"Decriminalization of crime is not a solution, please do not pass this legislation, instead, focus on and come up with a plan to stop repeat offenders who are committing most of the crime.",36,,

207,0.97,1376.708,1381.012,The proposal is turning its back on the businesses that have helped build this neighborhood.,39,,

227,0.97,1505.737,1508.206,This proposal does not even mention public safety.,44,,

325,0.97,2134.832,2144.842,In every sector I have been struck by the growing wealth and inequality in our region and the lengths that the members must go to survive.,62,,
326,0.97,2144.842,2153.951,Living in poverty should not be treated as a criminal act which is why I'm calling today in support of changing direct and Minimus law to curb prosecution of poverty and mental health struggles.,62,,

344,0.97,2230.728,2231.629,Just some quick opening remarks.,65,,
345,0.97,2231.629,2242.974,This presentation is a requirement of the accountability legislation adopted by the Council in 2017 sponsored by Councilmember Gonzalez.,65,,
346,0.97,2242.974,2249.647,This is the midyear report that has been delayed due to the Council meeting in June.,65,,
347,0.97,2249.647,2273.771,"All three accountability bodies are with us at the table along with the Seattle police Department, the accountability legislation calls for the inspector general and the community police Commission to present a midyear report to the public safety committee and for SPD to be at the table.",65,,
348,0.97,2273.771,2279.277,I really appreciate that the office of police accountability is here with us.,65,,

351,0.97,2295.559,2304.035,I'm going to begin with brief introductory remarks and between the three accountability entities we will split the introduction section up.,66,,
352,0.97,2304.035,2318.449,Each of the offices will take terms to talk about their work product that has been going on this year.,66,,
353,0.97,2318.449,2319.984,Shayleen will be sharing our Powerpoint.,66,,
354,0.97,2319.984,2325.189,"Thank you, Shayleen, for navigating that.",66,,
355,0.97,2332.663,2339.77,I am giving it a minute because I do not see the slides on the screen.,67,,
356,0.97,2339.77,2345.676,Can you see them now?,68,,
357,0.97,2345.676,2346.077,Yes.,69,,
358,0.97,2346.077,2353.584,I think this picture conveys what we are dealing with at this moment in time.,69,,
359,0.97,2353.584,2363.16,We have two Transformational defining events of 2020 that have challenged all of our assumptions of what is normal.,69,,
360,0.97,2363.16,2372.97,"To put this presentation in context, we appreciate at this time it is both extremely challenging for all of us personally and professionally and it is also an opportunity.",69,,
361,0.97,2372.97,2377.575,That makes this an exceptionally difficult report to present at this time and this year.,69,,
362,0.97,2377.575,2387.118,For the oversight entities you are going to hear about the work that has been done in Olympia and also projects and work we are undertaking at home.,69,,
363,0.97,2387.118,2390.087,Most of these and many of these have been driven by the mass police protest.,69,,
364,0.97,2390.087,2399.296,Just to give a framework for this to work would be challenging under the best of circumstances and we have a global health crisis on top of it.,69,,
365,0.97,2399.296,2403.601,We are in a climate that is straining all of our physical and emotional resources.,69,,
366,0.97,2403.601,2409.507,Just putting that out there to recognize the reality that we are all dealing with.,69,,
367,0.97,2409.507,2413.511,Moving onto the next slide.,69,,
368,0.97,2413.511,2419.416,"Each year, this is an annual requirement as you noted.",69,,

370,0.97,2423.521,2441.038,"It is really an opportunity to highlight the issues, the recommendations that the accountability entities have had for both SPD and OPA as a part of the accountability function.",69,,
371,0.97,2441.038,2448.312,The report also is called upon to highlight any issues related to the budget at the state agenda and Collective- bargaining Agendas.,69,,
372,0.97,2448.312,2452.95,We will be touching on those as well.,69,,
373,0.97,2452.95,2458.789,Very briefly on the budget.,70,,
374,0.97,2458.789,2464.094,"Because we have just recently concluded the budget, this will be a brief comment.",70,,
375,0.97,2464.094,2469.166,There has been a significant heavy lift for the work that has been done to date.,70,,
376,0.97,2469.166,2476.474,You see the movement of 911 and the parking enforcement office out of SPD.,70,,
377,0.97,2476.474,2487.885,Those changes and more to come creates new bodies of work in areas and ways we need to examine how we will provide effective oversight in light of these changes.,70,,
378,0.97,2487.885,2497.995,Also of course the consent decree is an ongoing process that is still in the works and that creates Dynamics related to the budget as well.,70,,
379,0.97,2497.995,2508.806,This is just a note to state that there has been a heavy lift on the budget so far.,70,,
380,0.97,2508.806,2514.912,We expect that work is going to be kicking into high gear early next year for 2022.,70,,
381,0.97,2514.912,2523.22,"I would just like to take a moment to thank the Council, in particular, for your support during the budget process.",70,,
382,0.97,2523.22,2524.755,You will be hearing more about that.,70,,
383,0.97,2524.755,2535.833,We appreciate your support there and our funding needs to ensure that we have adequate support for the community centered effort that is being undertaken there.,70,,
384,0.97,2535.833,2540.237,With that brief introduction I will turn it over to Shayleen.,70,,
385,0.97,2540.237,2544.141,"Thank you, Amy.",71,,

390,0.97,2561.792,2578.676,"At the top, we want to talk about the state legislative agenda and recognize some highlights ago some top priorities is that all of the accountability partners agree on, talk about the reform of police certification and decertification process.",71,,
391,0.97,2578.676,2585.516,Establishing a special Prosecutor to look at the police misconduct cases and also establishing a statewide investigative entity for serious and deadly use of force.,71,,
392,0.97,2585.516,2595.225,Some other highlights we would like to mention that work mentioned by partners individually or collectively was creating a duty to intervene when officers witnessed police misconduct.,71,,

397,0.97,2633.163,2649.346,70% of that task force is made up of the members and also a percentage of OPA and the rest is others that make up the task force.,71,,
398,0.97,2649.346,2653.751,Just to Hone in a little bit on CPC activities when we talk about our advocacy and legislative work.,71,,
399,0.97,2653.751,2663.36,We do identify and advocate for reforms to state laws that will enhance public trust and policing and the criminal justice system.,71,,
400,0.97,2663.36,2670.668,I say that because I like to focus on what PC has put forth that went forward to counsel especially yesterday during the votes.,71,,
401,0.97,2670.668,2677.374,We want to show where we are blind and potentially where we disagree and where changes could be made.,71,,
402,0.97,2677.374,2685.716,We are aligned and pleased to be aligned at removing police accountability from the collective bargaining process.,71,,

409,0.97,2715.546,2721.452,The one we did ask for in our recommendations was to have a statewide ban on Teargas.,71,,
410,0.97,2721.452,2725.122,That is not demonstrated but put forth.,71,,
411,0.97,2725.122,2736.066,"There is some language where we think we could interpret that in some way, but it is not clearly delineated within that.",71,,
412,0.97,2736.066,2749.813,"Some exciting news that people are aware of but we like to highlight, for the first time we will have a technical advisor at the bargaining table as an advisor to the city and counsel Mayor's office.",71,,

417,0.97,2780.377,2785.682,We actually collaborate quite a bit on a variety of topics.,72,,
418,0.97,2785.682,2802.499,The ones we want to highlight today are the fact that it is called for in the police accountability ordinance that we meet quarterly and discuss all policy issues on the table and any other topics that need discussion.,72,,
419,0.97,2802.499,2828.992,"We also, this year, met repeatedly to create a officer of all shooting protocol that calls on and requires more care towards community in those situations and being aware of a variety of Stakeholders and partners and how we can be more thoughtful in the protocol when there is an officer involved shooting.",72,,
420,0.97,2828.992,2835.699,"As Shayleen mentioned, the state legislator agenda has been in collaboration.",72,,

426,0.97,2868.031,2875.205,That is just a quick NOTE on Collaborations.,72,,
427,0.97,2875.205,2885.182,I am going to jump into CPC specific work and then hand it over to our partners as well.,73,,

435,0.97,2920.15,2926.423,"Some of the challenges that we are facing, I want to take a minute to highlight this.",74,,
436,0.97,2926.423,2935.999,"While there are challenges, there are also areas of opportunity for partnership and growth with our partners and Std.",74,,
437,0.97,2935.999,2936.767,A couple of items.,74,,
438,0.97,2936.767,2947.144,There has been a lack of fermentation when it comes to anything that has come forward to Sbd from our office.,74,,
439,0.97,2947.144,2954.651,We have yet to see implantation but we hope to continue to partner with them and see what the challenges and barriers are and how we can get past them.,74,,
440,0.97,2954.651,2962.993,"In addition, there has been unfulfilled information and data request that was sent out specifically again to Sbd.",74,,
441,0.97,2962.993,2968.398,We recognize during this time of covert that there are some great barriers and some time constraints.,74,,
442,0.97,2968.398,2972.969,We are aware and cognizant of that.,74,,
443,0.97,2972.969,2987.584,We look forward to Partnering with our accountability partners and with Sbd to see where we can move past barriers and how we can have any Workarounds in Re-Sitting Resetting our targets and parties for the community.,74,,

445,0.97,2993.19,2997.728,This happens in a number of ways.,74,,
446,0.97,2997.728,3005.635,"We have demonstration management committee, as we are working through those recommendations in July and August over the summer.",74,,

449,0.97,3024.721,3029.626,I think everyone felt the strain and time crunch.,74,,
450,0.97,3029.626,3037.067,We have reinvigorated this work group and we are working diligently with commissioners in the community to get back up and running.,74,,
451,0.97,3037.067,3039.536,We also Reengage the community system partners group.,74,,

454,0.97,3050.18,3057.054,You will see some of that within our angle reports.,74,,
455,0.97,3057.054,3065.262,Another big news that we have been talking about with our partners and a little bit with the public is the CPC recommendation Tracker.,74,,
456,0.97,3065.262,3079.176,"As most of you know the CPC is the owner of the recommendation Tracker, that tracks the recommendations that the partners put forth to Sbd and OPA as far as reforms and oversight.",74,,
457,0.97,3079.176,3080.377,What does that look like?,74,,

466,0.97,3133.196,3136.032,Our team decided to use.,74,,
467,0.97,3136.032,3149.88,"The policy team is right now building this Tracker public facing dashboard . We intend to launch this at the end of this year, top of next year, so very soon.",74,,
468,0.97,3149.88,3165.462,You mentioned earlier that there was an accumulation of recommendations not acted upon.,75,,

470,0.97,3166.897,3167.964,"Yes, it will.",76,,
471,0.97,3167.964,3176.473,This Tracker will serve a few purposes.,76,,
472,0.97,3176.473,3183.013,One it is where we are not following information.,76,,
473,0.97,3183.013,3185.181,While we are the keeper of updating it and holding its.,76,,
474,0.97,3185.181,3189.386,"We want everyone to see this, that includes our partners and the public.",76,,
475,0.97,3189.386,3194.925,"The Mayor's office, city Council, anytime you can go on and see what's going on.",76,,
476,0.97,3194.925,3196.393,All of the recommendations will be listed.,76,,

478,0.97,3208.672,3223.42,"If there have been steps taken, or complete steps taken, we hope to in the documentation or some wording that lets people know yes Sbd said they have completed this and this is how they did it.",76,,
479,0.97,3223.42,3226.89,And vice versa you will see where they have not taken action.,76,,

490,0.97,3280.677,3286.983,Right now the city remains with compliance and accountability.,80,,
491,0.97,3286.983,3300.797,The city was found out of compliance in May 2019 and then the city was ordered to work with the DOJ and the CPC to create a plan to come back into compliance for August 2019.,80,,
492,0.97,3300.797,3308.905,That has not been completed and was pointed out multiple times in CPC court filings that we have filed throughout this past year.,80,,
493,0.97,3308.905,3320.25,"Also, the CPC has posed city DOJ motion to discharge the subsequent commitments to the dissent decree.",80,,
494,0.97,3320.25,3321.918,The city withdrew that after the protest we can.,80,,
495,0.97,3321.918,3326.99,"This is still ongoing, and still out of compliance.",80,,
496,0.97,3326.99,3347.477,"Lastly some of the other priorities just so you are aware of what the Commission is working on, we are still working on community engagement that includes district leads and also looking at how we can virtually engage with the community during the pandemic as this will be ongoing for some time.",80,,
497,0.97,3347.477,3370.667,"With in our police practices work group and commissioners that are doing this work we are reviewing arbitration and the PS CSC, surveillance, 911 dispatch, crisis intervention, officer wellness and the last two we are looking at training broadly when it comes to Academy De-Escalation training and how they are working and if they are effective.",80,,
498,0.97,3370.667,3377.774,Similar to what Ann was talking about with collaboration we are working together with partners when it comes to contract negotiations.,80,,
499,0.97,3377.774,3381.411,We are very excited to have an advisor at the table.,80,,
500,0.97,3381.411,3391.755,We are also looking,80,,
501,0.97,3400.797,3410.407,"We will talk more about that on a later date, something we are very excited about and hope to look at more into the future.",81,,
502,0.97,3410.407,3412.976,"Internal business, so everyone knows what we are doing.",81,,
503,0.97,3412.976,3421.317,"If you don't attend public meetings that happen every other Wednesday, we are in the process of searching for a new permanent executive director.",81,,
504,0.97,3421.317,3421.851,The search is underway.,81,,
505,0.97,3421.851,3428.425,We are going through new Commissioner on boarding and bringing on new commissioners.,81,,
506,0.97,3428.425,3436.432,As you see looking at my face.,81,,
507,0.97,3436.432,3439.536,We have a senior policy Voicesser and an analyst.,81,,
508,0.97,3439.536,3449.445,We have been Hitsing the ground running and working with organizations to ensure implementation is happening and the community is aware and able to access that.,81,,
509,0.97,3449.445,3450.613,Primary part of our job.,81,,
510,0.97,3450.613,3452.148,I believe that's it for us.,81,,
511,0.97,3452.148,3459.389,I will turn it over to Oig.,81,,
512,0.97,3459.389,3460.557,Thank you.,82,,
513,0.97,3460.557,3465.862,Thank you.,83,,
514,0.97,3465.862,3471.868,"Good morning Madam chair, I apologize, I am having significant technical issues.",84,,
515,0.97,3471.868,3484.147,You can't see me but after I talk here for a few minutes I will try to switch devices.,84,,
516,0.97,3484.147,3490.487,"Picking up some of the work, I will talk about the various projects we've got on going and have completed this year.",84,,
517,0.97,3490.487,3502.765,I want to start by highlighting Oig's work in terms of the protests over the summer that's largely consumed a lot of our resources and staff time.,84,,
518,0.97,3502.765,3513.243,I wanted to highlight a couple things in terms of work we are doing there.,84,,
519,0.97,3513.243,3522.385,At the beginning of the summer one of the first products we produced was a summary of the types of weapons used.,84,,
520,0.97,3522.385,3541.971,Some descriptions about just generally how those weapons are used and how they were used by SPD and we were asked with other partner entities to provide recommendations to Council related to the ordinances.,84,,
521,0.97,3541.971,3545.475,That involved significant audit resources and policy work to put that together.,84,,
522,0.97,3545.475,3560.657,"Aside from that, we have been working to build a fairly robust review process that involves community and Stakeholder involvement, input, an event review.",84,,
523,0.97,3560.657,3573.136,It's a way we are trying to really look at negative outcomes and try to find systemic positive of the things so we can fix them and keep bad things from happening in the future.,84,,
524,0.97,3573.136,3595.525,It was work as many of you know that was inspired by processes used by my former agency back in Tucson to bring community into the room of course and to have a voice at the table and deciding what happened and how to correct or bring deficiencies to the future.,84,,
525,0.97,3595.525,3613.209,"We have been working with community, doing a lot of engagement around this process, building not just a process that takes community and focus with community but try to identify critical voices like a review panel table.",84,,
526,0.97,3613.209,3616.112,We are very pleased with the progress we are making.,84,,
527,0.97,3616.112,3630.827,"We hope to convene first panel in early January with experts, community representatives, and other partner Stakeholders at the table.",84,,
528,0.97,3630.827,3643.84,If we still have our comments line open at Oig process if folks want to learn more or contribute whatever way they want to.,84,,
529,0.97,3643.84,3647.543,"Sentinel event @ Seattle.Gov, if you want to make comments.",84,,
530,0.97,3647.543,3659.989,"You look at the Oig Website, there is information about the process and the development of it at this point.",84,,
531,0.97,3659.989,3669.465,If deputy Inspector General would like me to give photo credit to Commissioner Strauss.,84,,
532,0.97,3669.465,3670.833,So thank you for that.,84,,
533,0.97,3670.833,3674.47,We can move on unless anybody has questions or comments.,84,,
534,0.97,3674.47,3682.612,In terms of audit and assessment work in 2020 we produced a report about K-9 unit in late spring.,84,,
535,0.97,3682.612,3704.033,"We also produced a report that was about police case management system vulnerability issues that came to light with Oig personnel and were able to work with Seattle Department of I.T., S.P.D., the result of the vulnerability in a nice collaborative way.",84,,
536,0.97,3704.033,3705.935,That consumed resources early in the year.,84,,
537,0.97,3705.935,3711.007,We've got two other Audits that are about to be published.,84,,
538,0.97,3711.007,3713.743,They're in the final editing stages.,84,,
539,0.97,3713.743,3730.326,"That's one related to destruction of DNA samples in 2019 by SPD, mistaken destruction, and an audit of secured firearms storage in police training and police facilities.",84,,
540,0.97,3730.326,3733.93,Those are either already published or about to be published in the next week or two.,84,,
541,0.97,3733.93,3745.775,Some of the work we have that's ongoing are chapter 1418 surveillance Audits and chapter 1412 compliance Audits.,84,,
542,0.97,3745.775,3753.75,That is ongoing work and we can look forward to seeing products from Oig in the not too distant future.,84,,
543,0.97,3753.75,3765.294,We have audit ongoing that relates to mutual aid and how other agencies work with SPD and what operations look like when they're working with other partner agencies.,84,,
544,0.97,3765.294,3768.865,We are hoping to wrap that up in Q1.,84,,
545,0.97,3768.865,3774.57,We kicked off an audit of effectiveness of the discipline appeal system for SPD.,84,,
546,0.97,3774.57,3778.107,That was supposed to be one of our first Audits in 2020.,84,,
547,0.97,3778.107,3784.046,A lot of the work largely got derailed by having to focus on SPD protest response.,84,,
548,0.97,3784.046,3794.657,This was one of the projects we were hoping would help to inform efforts with the consent decree and questions the court had about effectiveness of the discipline and appeals system.,84,,
549,0.97,3794.657,3802.031,We are hoping that that will be valuable information for the city and other Stakeholders.,84,,
550,0.97,3802.031,3819.682,"Inspector General judge, the last item, effectiveness of disciplinary appeals process, that was to build off of a previous year's body of work which was to map the disciplinary appeals process.",85,,
551,0.97,3819.682,3820.883,Is my recollection correct?,85,,
552,0.97,3820.883,3823.085,"Yes, Madam chair, that's exactly correct.",86,,
553,0.97,3823.085,3839.502,"We had first under taken to try to really understand the discipline and appeals process because it's pretty elaborate and has a lot of aspects to it, a lot of connection points with various Stakeholders and participants.",86,,
554,0.97,3839.502,3841.771,"We mapped it completely, got a good understanding.",86,,
555,0.97,3841.771,3848.11,Now we will try to get an understanding of how effective it is.,86,,
556,0.97,3848.11,3848.878,Thank you.,87,,
557,0.97,3848.878,3874.103,Are there other 2020 work program items not represented on this slide that you either haven't gotten to that you intend to get to or that you are going to have to reassess whether or not it's a priority to do that work.,87,,
558,0.97,3874.103,3877.306,There were items and some have been deferred.,88,,
559,0.97,3877.306,3880.943,"Some have been replaced by other priorities, I think.",88,,
560,0.97,3880.943,3888.551,There is consensus among folks who provide feedback on work plans and our office about the need to work on disparity work.,88,,
561,0.97,3888.551,3895.091,I know there is a lot of interest in taking a look at the 911 system.,88,,
562,0.97,3895.091,3904.333,I think we're going to have to be thoughtful about that as it moves outs of SPD about how that's done and how it is Resourced.,88,,
563,0.97,3904.333,3911.574,There are carry over projects and some new work.,88,,
564,0.97,3911.574,3912.575,Thank you.,89,,
565,0.97,3912.575,3915.811,"If you would advance the slide, thank you very much.",90,,
566,0.97,3915.811,3926.222,Just a little bit of an overview of our work doing reviews with classifications and investigations.,90,,
567,0.97,3926.222,3932.895,We do regular review of all the classifications to be sure they're appropriate.,90,,
568,0.97,3932.895,3953.082,"When OPA has completed an investigation, we do a thorough review of that investigation and certify it to be sure it is Unbiased and timely.",90,,
569,0.97,3953.082,3958.554,Be sure it is Unbiased and meeting time requirements necessary under the contract.,90,,
570,0.97,3958.554,3961.791,Other areas are programs OPA has been developing.,90,,
571,0.97,3961.791,3970.599,"And as they do, we have been developing and implementing appropriate oversight of those.",90,,
572,0.97,3970.599,3982.778,"Those are Unsubstantiated misconduct reviews, bias reviews, some work around mediation work to resolve OPA complaints and rapid adjudication program.",90,,
573,0.97,3982.778,3986.248,I think OPA will probably discuss these in some detail.,90,,
574,0.97,3986.248,3994.223,But I am certainly willing to talk about the work we are doing in the area.,90,,
575,0.97,3994.223,3998.994,We have a meeting in which I think we will talk about bias review.,90,,
576,0.97,3998.994,4002.998,So we are preparing information to brief you further on that this week.,90,,
577,0.97,4002.998,4003.699,Thank you.,91,,
578,0.97,4003.699,4011.607,We also have started producing quarterly reports of our work.,92,,
579,0.97,4011.607,4013.709,We started that in May.,92,,
580,0.97,4013.709,4032.094,We put quarterly reviews on the Website as well as an aggregation of that and some additional work in the annual report that will be produced in Q1 of 2021.,92,,
581,0.97,4032.094,4039.034,Some other really interesting work we have been doing this year are some special projects.,92,,
582,0.97,4039.034,4051.781,"One was mentioned earlier and that's a project that we have been working with an expert from the UK on improving SPD's interviewing protocols for suspects, witnesses, and victims.",92,,
583,0.97,4051.781,4056.052,It is really developed around many people that know about the meets model.,92,,
584,0.97,4056.052,4095.624,"We are working with our Stakeholders and with this expert to develop a comprehensive program of policy and training and a train the Trainer program so SPD can have its own internal robust means of training officers and investigators on how to best talk to people and get information without having it tainted, without any risk of false confessions and really in a manner that gets the best most reliable information out of people to put together good criminal prosecutions.",92,,
585,0.97,4095.624,4096.158,That's really exciting.,92,,
586,0.97,4096.158,4098.761,Covid was not our friend with trying to kick this off.,92,,
587,0.97,4098.761,4101.764,We were scheduled to start training in spring.,92,,
588,0.97,4101.764,4110.206,We've had to get creative and we are just about to launch our first Online training to get the program going next week.,92,,
589,0.97,4110.206,4114.61,I am really excited about that.,92,,
590,0.97,4114.61,4115.211,That's it for me.,92,,
591,0.97,4115.211,4125.688,I will turn it over to OPA.,92,,
592,0.97,4128.19,4128.424,Thank you.,92,,
593,0.97,4128.424,4129.391,All right.,93,,
594,0.97,4129.391,4132.127,", can we go to the next slide please?",93,,
595,0.97,4132.127,4132.428,Thank you.,93,,
596,0.97,4132.428,4136.165,We wanted to talk a little bit about OPA policy recommendations.,93,,
597,0.97,4136.165,4140.736,These come in the form of what we call a management action recommendation.,93,,
598,0.97,4140.736,4150.579,That is a finding that the director can issue after an individual investigation of the complaint of misconduct.,93,,
599,0.97,4150.579,4163.692,So he issues a management action recommendation or just a policy recommendation when it is basically a tool for correcting a gap or ambiguity or an issue with SPD policy.,93,,
600,0.97,4163.692,4177.373,"In 2020 so far, we have issued 13 of these policy recommendations including two that were just issued last week.",93,,
601,0.97,4177.373,4188.45,"Spd has fully implemented, it says on slide 2, but we just got word yesterday I believe that they've implemented four more.",93,,
602,0.97,4188.45,4196.759,So they've actually implemented or they've completed six of the policy recommendations and I know they're close to completing many others.,93,,
603,0.97,4196.759,4204.833,They had a tough year as mentioned in terms of Covid and staffing issues.,93,,
604,0.97,4204.833,4206.435,We've traveled and been collaborating.,93,,
605,0.97,4206.435,4212.041,They're just unable to get many of these moving as quickly as normal.,93,,
606,0.97,4212.041,4216.645,"While they're still outstanding, they will be completed at some point.",93,,
607,0.97,4216.645,4222.952,"They can either partially implement them, fully implement them, or decline action.",93,,
608,0.97,4222.952,4225.621,A lot of them are still active.,93,,
609,0.97,4225.621,4238.367,"On the next slide, we give you a screen shot of what OPA Website looks like where it shows all the different recommendations.",93,,
610,0.97,4238.367,4252.915,Opa and SPD meet quarterly to discuss the recommendations and to be sure they're still continuing moving along and that we are on the same page about what each recommendation means and whether or not it has been fully implemented or partially implemented.,93,,
611,0.97,4252.915,4255.718,Can you go to the next slide please?,93,,
612,0.97,4255.718,4256.018,Thank you.,93,,
613,0.97,4256.018,4263.459,Here is a screen shot of what our page looks on our OPA Website of management action recommendations.,93,,
614,0.97,4263.459,4265.394,The issue is in the left column.,93,,
615,0.97,4265.394,4269.632,That shows the 13 that have been issued in 2020 this year.,93,,
616,0.97,4269.632,4274.103,Then the topic is listed in the third column.,93,,
617,0.97,4274.103,4277.74,That is kind of a general overview of what the topic is.,93,,
618,0.97,4277.74,4279.908,Then it says the status.,93,,
619,0.97,4279.908,4290.986,You can click on both the topic and the status to see the letter that OPA transmitted to SPD to discuss the issue and underlying investigation and case.,93,,
620,0.97,4290.986,4303.666,Then you can click on the link in the OPA status to see how SPD Responsibled and which pieces they either implemented or why they declined action or partially implemented.,93,,
621,0.97,4303.666,4310.572,Feel free to go to OPA's Website and look at the policy recommendations in more detail if you would like.,93,,
622,0.97,4310.572,4311.006,Thank you.,94,,
623,0.97,4311.006,4327.356,"It occurs to me that we actually do have SPD represented at the table with us Today., I think, just for exactly this purpose of engaging with SPD about topics like this.",94,,
624,0.97,4327.356,4340.903,"I am wondering Rebecca if you have a few words to say about status of the 2020 recommendations, whether or not you believe additional recommendations will be implemented this year.",94,,
625,0.97,4340.903,4356.685,"Then I would ask whether or not there is is similar procedure in place as described for the OPA, if there is a similar procedure in place for CPC as it relates to their open and Unimplemented recommendations.",94,,
626,0.97,4356.685,4358.12,"Good morning, yes.",95,,
627,0.97,4358.12,4360.422,Thank you for the opportunity.,95,,
628,0.97,4360.422,4367.963,"So we meet quarterly with Opi, Oig, CPC to go over the recommendations not all of which are aligned.",95,,
629,0.97,4367.963,4376.372,"So there is often a fair amount of discussion that needs to take place, you know, around what the next course of a action is.",95,,
630,0.97,4376.372,4379.842,There are some recommendations that would require operational changes.,95,,
631,0.97,4379.842,4386.014,So we need to make sure that we are bringing the operational folks to the table to have these discussions as well.,95,,
632,0.97,4386.014,4391.353,"Like so many things, it is a matter of bandwidth and a matter of Prioritization.",95,,
633,0.97,4391.353,4394.356,So we are plowing through these.,95,,
634,0.97,4394.356,4399.595,"There are some recommendations that are pretty easy LIFTS, are policy Tweaks that we agree with.",95,,
635,0.97,4399.595,4407.903,We move forward with those as expeditiously as we can through audit policy and research section.,95,,
636,0.97,4407.903,4415.878,"There are others that require more conversation, whether it's with a lot apartment, whether with all three accountability partners together.",95,,
637,0.97,4415.878,4430.492,We do continue to work through all the management actions we receive through OPA as well as recommendations from CPC and certainly audit recommendations that follow from the Oig.,95,,
638,0.97,4430.492,4433.195,Thank you for that.,96,,
639,0.97,4433.195,4443.338,I am wondering what is the thinking about having different dash boards for different accountability partners?,96,,
640,0.97,4443.338,4465.327,Might it make sense to sort of merge the dash board with a different drop down menu for who is making recommendations so that people have one place to go and see the outstanding recommendations from all three accountability members?,96,,
641,0.97,4465.327,4465.894,That's one question.,96,,
642,0.97,4465.894,4506.301,"The other question, I think it would be helpful on the page where it lists either active or implemented, if there is an indication of items that we shouldn't expect SPD to implement because they disagree, they're not aligned, so we can look at that, understand it, and decide whether or not that's acceptable or whether or not there needs to be more conversation to seek that alignment.",96,,
643,0.97,4506.301,4516.245,I am just thinking of the city auditor and they do an annual report.,96,,
644,0.97,4516.245,4551.413,"They indicate, so it's end report of all the recommendations on all topics over the past years and they do sort of a red, yellow, green indicator to tell the public what the status is and the Red indicator is an indicator that says the public should not expect further work on that item because there is typically a lack of alignment with the Department of whether or not that recommendation should be implemented.",96,,
645,0.97,4551.413,4561.924,I just think of it as part of the transparency that I think we are all seeking that should be evident in the recommendation status.,96,,
646,0.97,4561.924,4566.094,Thank you for those comments Councilmember Herbold.,97,,
647,0.97,4566.094,4570.666,"We actually do NOTE when action has been declined, so that would indicate disagreement.",97,,
648,0.97,4570.666,4577.906,They just happen to be active now and we haven't received a letter that says declined action.,97,,
649,0.97,4577.906,4583.512,"But when they do decline action, that usually indicates disagreement or lack of alignment on the issue.",97,,
650,0.97,4583.512,4587.482,Spd will write a letter and explain why and then you will be able to see that.,97,,
651,0.97,4587.482,4595.123,"If you go to maybe a past year like 2019, it may show action declined and you will be able to see an example.",97,,
652,0.97,4595.123,4597.926,You should be able to see that in the future.,97,,
653,0.97,4597.926,4604.032,It's just these particular ones haven't been designated that because we haven't received the letter.,97,,
654,0.97,4604.032,4605.233,Does that make sense?,97,,
655,0.97,4605.233,4607.502,It does make sense.,98,,
656,0.97,4607.502,4615.711,My recollection is that there is sort of a response letter that is due within a certain amount of time.,98,,
657,0.97,4615.711,4617.279,Is there a time line?,98,,
658,0.97,4617.279,4625.754,"There is a 30 day acknowledgment that the letter has been received, that requirement.",99,,
659,0.97,4625.754,4630.926,We have actually created a separate procedure for management action recommendations.,99,,
660,0.97,4630.926,4636.865,"We track them, and we do have SPD request extension.",99,,
661,0.97,4636.865,4641.103,We actually usually give them six months or three months to complete the action.,99,,
662,0.97,4641.103,4643.271,The acknowledgment letter is just that.,99,,
663,0.97,4643.271,4648.977,"It's basically yes we received your letter, thank you, which isn't very significant.",99,,
664,0.97,4648.977,4657.252,So we've kind of moved beyond that and are tracking additional action.,99,,
665,0.97,4657.252,4680.409,"So using the January 9, 2020, example, a recommendation regarding body worn Video, that is noted as active, but there is no indication that SPD has agreed with the recommendations and that active means we are working on it verses active and the indication is that we don't intend to work on it.",100,,
666,0.97,4680.409,4684.379,Is there a field there that I am missing?,100,,
667,0.97,4684.379,4684.613,No.,101,,
668,0.97,4684.613,4688.216,I believe active generally means active and they're working on it.,101,,
669,0.97,4688.216,4697.926,Some of these just take an awfully long time to implement or are multi pronged in the approach and require multiple months.,101,,
670,0.97,4697.926,4710.839,This year in particular as I mentioned they've asked for a variety of extensions just because of bandwidth.,101,,
671,0.97,4710.839,4723.452,"To address your previous question about merging two policy databases, these recommendations will be reflected on the CPC's more Holistic recommendation Tracker.",101,,
672,0.97,4723.452,4743.305,"While we will continue to have our own web page, individually they will also be documented on Cpcs for anyone who wants a Holistic look.",101,,
673,0.97,4743.305,4743.572,Great.,102,,
674,0.97,4743.572,4743.872,Thank you.,102,,
675,0.97,4743.872,4751.446,Are we at the end of our presentation?,103,,
676,0.97,4751.446,4756.184,One more slide.,104,,
677,0.97,4756.184,4757.185,Got it.,105,,
678,0.97,4757.185,4757.819,Good morning.,106,,
679,0.97,4757.819,4763.692,I will touch briefly on the able program mentioned by the inspector general.,106,,
680,0.97,4763.692,4769.231,Spd received a recommendation from the inspector general to develop a peer intervention program.,106,,
681,0.97,4769.231,4777.739,We sent staff to the New Orleans epic training program with the expectation that we would then be able to develop a training course for SPD.,106,,
682,0.97,4777.739,4786.047,The epic program has since evolved into the able program which is the active bystander for law enforcement.,106,,
683,0.97,4786.047,4804.332,"This program was developed by Georgetown University's innovative policing program, a scenario based training program kind to provide police personnel with tools, training, authority to intervene to prevent or stop improper behavior, to prevent mistakes, promote officer health and wellness.",106,,
684,0.97,4804.332,4808.47,We'll have more information about that coming out.,106,,
685,0.97,4808.47,4816.044,But I want to specifically thank CPC and sound health for the letters they wrote in support of SPD joining the program.,106,,
686,0.97,4816.044,4837.599,"We have four Trainers who are currently part of the train the Trainer program that's ongoing and in January, initial classes will start with personnel from the training section, wellness unit, command, and we expect full roll out to begin in February and continue for several months.",106,,
687,0.97,4837.599,4837.966,Thank you.,107,,
688,0.97,4837.966,4840.669,This is good news to hear.,107,,
689,0.97,4840.669,4847.943,I appreciate your responsiveness to this particular recommendation.,107,,
690,0.97,4847.943,4848.51,And the training efforts.,107,,
691,0.97,4848.51,4861.756,Is there currently within the SPD policy and procedures manual a policy related to the expectation that officers intervene?,107,,
692,0.97,4861.756,4864.492,It's embodied in title 5 of the SPD manual.,108,,
693,0.97,4864.492,4872.934,Do we expect there to be any changes to the current policy based on this implementation and training?,109,,
694,0.97,4872.934,4873.335,That's likely.,110,,
695,0.97,4873.335,4894.322,"As you know most of the policies go through an annual review process and in doing so, we update to align with our current practices and training.",110,,
696,0.97,4894.322,4896.324,All right.,111,,
697,0.97,4896.324,4910.805,So just looking at the Thumbnails of all the other Council members here and looking to see if anybody has any questions?,111,,
698,0.97,4910.805,4923.418,"Not seeing anybody come off mute or any hands raised, so with that, I want to thank all of you for joining us today for your annual review.",111,,
699,0.97,4923.418,4924.452,"It's very, very appreciated.",111,,
700,0.97,4924.452,4940.769,I really appreciate all the efforts especially towards transparency around previous years' recommendations so that we can all hold ourselves and other parts of the system accountable for making progress.,111,,
701,0.97,4940.769,4946.107,Thank you again for joining us and all your hard work in these difficult times.,111,,
702,0.97,4946.107,4950.578,"Alex, can you read the next item into the record.",111,,
703,0.97,4950.578,4976.271,"Agenda item 2, council bill 119974, ordinance relating to civilian and community oversight of police creating a subpoena process for office of police accountability, office of Inspector General for public safety while ensuring due process for individuals subject of the subpoena and acting sections 3.29.126 and .245 to Seattle municipal code.",112,,
704,0.97,4976.271,4977.138,Thank you.,113,,
705,0.97,4977.138,4987.382,"We start with a quick round of introductions, please.",113,,
706,0.97,4987.382,4993.288,"Greg Doss, council central staff.",114,,
707,0.97,4993.288,4995.724,Director of OPA.,115,,
708,0.97,4995.724,4997.092,Good morning.,116,,
709,0.97,4997.092,4999.794,Michelle chin Mayor's office legal counsel.,116,,
710,0.97,4999.794,5001.062,Thank you.,117,,
711,0.97,5001.062,5014.342,Good morning Lisa jug Inspector General for public safety.,118,,
712,0.97,5014.342,5018.546,"John, Gasol, either one of you.",119,,
713,0.97,5018.546,5019.347,Good morning.,120,,
714,0.97,5019.347,5019.981,Seattle city attorneys office.,120,,
715,0.97,5019.981,5025.754,I think John is up for the next item.,120,,
716,0.97,5025.754,5030.125,That takes care of introductions.,120,,
717,0.97,5030.125,5034.229,Councilmember you went on mute.,121,,
718,0.97,5034.229,5036.531,Thank you all for being with us.,122,,
719,0.97,5036.531,5043.938,"I think I am going to hand it to central staff, just a couple words.",122,,
720,0.97,5043.938,5078.773,"Ben working with Mayor's office, Inspector general, office of professional police accountability and city attorneys office in developing this legislation and I really appreciate the collaboration towards meeting this goal that was contained in the 2017 accountability ordinance and the work that this ordinance does in introducing a process for using the authority contained in the 2017 accountability ordinance.",122,,
721,0.97,5078.773,5082.544,"With that, I will hand it over to Council central staff.",122,,
722,0.97,5082.544,5087.348,"Thank you, Madam chair and members of the committee, good morning again.",123,,
723,0.97,5087.348,5103.064,I am going to kick us off today with a brief summary of the legislation and then turn it over to our guests to talk about the issue and answer any questions.,123,,
724,0.97,5103.064,5113.408,My comments are captured in a central staff report that was E- mailed to members this morning and has been posted to Council's Website for public access.,123,,
725,0.97,5113.408,5126.488,"Council bill 119974 would add notification process to the subpoena powers that are provided to OPA director and Inspector General under 2017 police accountability ordinance, ordinance 125315.",123,,
726,0.97,5126.488,5139.367,The notification process would govern who you and when notification must be provided and would enhance due process by ensuring the recipient of a subpoena is aware of due process rights.,123,,
727,0.97,5139.367,5147.208,Council bill 119974 would require notice to be given at the same time as OPA director or Inspector General issued a subpoena.,123,,
728,0.97,5147.208,5179.307,"The notice must state the purpose of the subpoena and the basis for seeking the Informationan acknowledgment that the subpoena may be contested in court, a statement providing privileges and immunities for anyone who provides documentation and statement that would require search warrant or equivalent to use any evidence that is obtained through a separate criminal proceeding, a subpoena in a separate criminal proceeding.",123,,
729,0.97,5179.307,5199.627,"By way of background, subpoena powers currently provided to Inspector general and OPA director allow agencies to compel SPD officers, employees, or other entities such as private bank or private cell phone carrier to provide evidence in support.",123,,
730,0.97,5199.627,5211.272,Before subpoenas can be issued to compel the information the city must first negotiate terms governing subpoenas as part of the collective bargaining agreements with affected employees.,123,,
731,0.97,5211.272,5218.112,In this case that is Seattle police management Association and Seattle police officers' Guild.,123,,
732,0.97,5218.112,5232.427,The current Spma contract allows for issuance of subpoenas and Council bill 119974 would spell out due process and notification protections for Spma members.,123,,
733,0.97,5232.427,5234.963,Current contract does not allow for issuance of subpoenas.,123,,
734,0.97,5234.963,5240.468,This would have to be negotiated in upcoming contract discussions between the city and Spog.,123,,
735,0.97,5240.468,5255.483,"With this as overview, I will turn it to our guest to answer any specific questions that the Council members might have.",123,,
736,0.97,5255.483,5265.093,"Thank you, Greg.",124,,
737,0.97,5265.093,5279.707,"Seeing no hands or questions, I think we had comments we were expecting to receive from our guests here today about the utility of the legislation.",124,,
738,0.97,5279.707,5283.244,Michelle do you want to lead?,125,,
739,0.97,5283.244,5283.511,Sure.,126,,
740,0.97,5283.511,5285.78,Happy to.,126,,
741,0.97,5285.78,5286.28,Good morning.,126,,
742,0.97,5286.28,5295.356,"First I want to start with thank Yous, thank you Councilmember Herbold for holding a committee hearing on the legislation.",126,,
743,0.97,5295.356,5305.633,Thank you for your leadership and for your staff keeping us on task to get the legislation done by this year.,126,,
744,0.97,5305.633,5317.845,"Thank you to Meyer Berg and Lisa judge and deputy Amy sigh who have been full partners giving us their considerable time, input, feedback on developing this legislation.",126,,
745,0.97,5317.845,5333.561,Also I would like to thank city attorney Pete Holmes and assistant city attorney for their excellent legal support helping us to complete this legislation and jumping in midstream during a staffing transition.,126,,
746,0.97,5333.561,5367.628,"Finally, I'd like to thank Mayor Durkin who had the vision and challenged us to develop legislation that would build on the 2017 accountability ordinance and to strengthen civilian police oversight by making OPA and Oig's power to directly issue subpoenas and explicit legal authority and by building the process for how this is to ensure civil liberties and due process rights are protected.",126,,
747,0.97,5367.628,5373.901,This is the result of over six months' collaborative work by the group of committed Stakeholders including ACLU.,126,,
748,0.97,5373.901,5379.707,I am glad that we are able to accomplish this legislative goal by this year end.,126,,
749,0.97,5379.707,5394.722,In 2019 both the Federal Court over seeing the Seattle police Department consent decree and city's consultants national policing experts 21Cp issued a report that studied police accountability system.,126,,
750,0.97,5394.722,5403.197,And in it they noted there was a lack of certainty regarding subpoena authority.,126,,
751,0.97,5403.197,5424.652,"This legislation is in part in response to the concern, to make explicit the city's legal authority to grant administrative subpoenas as first class charter city and OPA and Oig's direct issuance of subpoena and enforcement to compel production of information to assist them in their investigations.",126,,
752,0.97,5424.652,5451.512,Also extremely important to the Mayor was making sure that the city had a process that recognizes the important fourth amendment due process rights and 5th amendment protections against self Incrimination for individuals who are often the Complainants or witnesses in the police misconduct investigations and to avoid a chilling effect that subpoenas might have on that cooperation.,126,,
753,0.97,5451.512,5459.453,It is very important that OPA and Oig have ability to gather information and evidence relevant to inquiries.,126,,
754,0.97,5459.453,5465.693,This means having the ability to compel production of information if necessary.,126,,
755,0.97,5465.693,5476.337,This power though must be balanced against the equally important due process rights of individuals who might receive the subpoenas.,126,,
756,0.97,5476.337,5490.084,This created some important issues on how to protect that privacy and civil liberties of of civilians who have relevant information in an OPA or Oig investigation.,126,,
757,0.97,5490.084,5499.093,So a critical component of police accountability we believe is people are willing to make complaints and are not intimidated by the process.,126,,
758,0.97,5499.093,5519.447,We believe this legislation which creates the process and protections for Complainants and individuals who might be the subject of the subpoena strikes that right balance and we ask the Council's support for passage of this legislation.,126,,
759,0.97,5519.447,5521.849,Thank you.,126,,
760,0.97,5521.849,5523.217,"Thank you, Michelle.",127,,
761,0.97,5523.217,5527.021,Director Meyer Berg or Inspector General judge.,127,,
762,0.97,5527.021,5529.156,Quickly supplements what Michelle mentioned.,128,,
763,0.97,5529.156,5534.662,We are at OPA very supportive of this ordinance.,128,,
764,0.97,5534.662,5543.471,"It's important with the accountability legislation while subpoena power was set forth, this explains it more or talks about the processes, talks about due process.",128,,
765,0.97,5543.471,5547.975,In that respect it goes further than accountability ordinance.,128,,
766,0.97,5547.975,5558.853,"We were pleased with collaborative work not just between city worker but with ACLU, the thoughts brought to the table and I think the finished product is exceptional.",128,,
767,0.97,5558.853,5559.387,We are very supportive.,128,,
768,0.97,5559.387,5584.412,Obviously we understand there are a couple hills to climb with bargaining with the units to fully expand subpoena power to mirror the expectations of the accountability ordinance but I think this is a great first step and it puts into law that OPA and Oig have subpoena power without limitation which is important.,128,,
769,0.97,5584.412,5586.547,"Thank you, director.",129,,
770,0.97,5586.547,5586.981,Inspector general.,129,,
771,0.97,5586.981,5588.149,Hi there.,130,,
772,0.97,5588.149,5589.05,"Yes, thank you.",130,,
773,0.97,5589.05,5593.12,I appreciate the comments of my colleagues and I echo the things they have said.,130,,
774,0.97,5593.12,5605.967,I don't feel like I have a whole lot to add to that other than my support of this legislation and my appreciation for all the work and collaboration that went into making this possible.,130,,
775,0.97,5605.967,5617.044,"I think as my office flagged pretty early on, this is a critical power, true robust accountability system can't work simply based on voluntary compliance alone.",130,,
776,0.97,5617.044,5626.854,I think this was a really necessary step for everyone to take.,130,,
777,0.97,5626.854,5629.457,I am speak appreciative of the underlying support that drove it.,130,,
778,0.97,5629.457,5629.757,Thank you.,130,,
779,0.97,5629.757,5631.826,That's all I have to add.,130,,
780,0.97,5631.826,5632.76,Thank you.,131,,
781,0.97,5632.76,5644.005,I would like to highlight that there are a few technical changes that need to be made that we'll be seeing in a substitute version at our next committee meeting.,131,,
782,0.97,5644.005,5652.646,"Amy, did you want to quickly touch upon some of the technical changes just to give Council members a preview of what to expect?",131,,
783,0.97,5652.646,5678.639,"At least one that I know of off hand is there is a little bit of a technical exercise in the fact that--sorry, this is totally technical, but it refers to subpoena authority in the chapter itself so eliminating some of the redundancy and some of the clean up, maybe a little homework with impacts to people who are employees verses Nonemployees.",132,,
784,0.97,5678.639,5681.876,A little bit due diligence and background work.,132,,
785,0.97,5681.876,5687.014,I think it's a solid product as is so we are looking at the technical kinds of aspects.,132,,
786,0.97,5687.014,5691.685,Thank you so much.,133,,
787,0.97,5691.685,5697.091,Any other questions or comments?,133,,
788,0.97,5697.091,5703.731,"Questions from Council members, comments from Council members, comments from other Stakeholders at the table here?",133,,
789,0.97,5703.731,5704.565,Councilmember Lewis.,133,,
790,0.97,5704.565,5705.966,"Thank you so much, Madam chair.",134,,
791,0.97,5705.966,5711.072,I will be brief and I want to ask a question to director Meyer Berg.,134,,
792,0.97,5711.072,5713.707,I am really gland this legislation is coming forward.,134,,
793,0.97,5713.707,5719.48,It's a very critical tool for the effectiveness of accountability agencies.,134,,
794,0.97,5719.48,5742.136,I wonder if you might just to Contextual eyes this a little for the viewing public on what the new power is really going to tangibly mean for the effectiveness and ability to complete investigations that maybe in the past would have had an inconclusive result or wouldn't have been able to build a strong enough case.,134,,
795,0.97,5742.136,5757.318,"Now with the new tool and new power, new evidence, new materials can be gathered by the office to make sure the justice is done and that without this tool, it has been difficult in some cases.",134,,
796,0.97,5757.318,5759.453,This is my understanding that I am laying out.,134,,
797,0.97,5759.453,5761.856,This isn't supposed to be a leading question.,134,,
798,0.97,5761.856,5769.029,"If you want it to be, I guess you could also take it as that.",134,,
799,0.97,5769.029,5783.611,"But just to illustrate what this is going to mean for future of investigations in the office of police accountability and how with this tool, we can really make sure we are honoring our mission with renewed diligence and effectiveness.",134,,
800,0.97,5783.611,5785.146,Thanks for the question.,135,,
801,0.97,5785.146,5794.722,"I would say, you know, at the out set, it's not necessarily a new tool per se.",135,,
802,0.97,5794.722,5801.028,Opa has within the contract subpoena power but that subpoena power was limited by the SpA project.,135,,
803,0.97,5801.028,5809.103,What we can do and what we have is issue subpoenas to Nonspd individuals and obviously not to families to seek records.,135,,
804,0.97,5809.103,5810.638,We have done that in the past.,135,,
805,0.97,5810.638,5815.476,We have sought phone records or other materials that have been relevant for investigation.,135,,
806,0.97,5815.476,5820.214,Subpoena power in general is incredibly important for two reasons.,135,,
807,0.97,5820.214,5828.522,"First to allow us to do that type of expansive work, to get to facts we wouldn't have been able to do prior to the ordinance being passed.",135,,
808,0.97,5828.522,5833.828,"Second of all, our system ensures chief of police and a Department that will cooperate with us.",135,,
809,0.97,5833.828,5845.706,"If that no longer is the case, subpoena power is essential to bring in witnesses, to interview sworn employees, to obtain Department records.",135,,
810,0.97,5845.706,5849.743,In some respects it prepares for worse case scenario.,135,,
811,0.97,5849.743,5864.825,"What this ordinance does is it makes abundantly clear that OPA and Oig have subpoena power, that we have a powerful robust subpoena power and that creates a process that strengthens that subpoena power so if there is a challenge, it will survive the challenge.",135,,
812,0.97,5864.825,5869.663,That is the purpose of the ordinance and I think it does so successfully.,135,,
813,0.97,5869.663,5877.137,I am not sure I totally answered your question which was leading but I think I did give a responsive answer.,135,,
814,0.97,5877.137,5877.905,I appreciate that.,136,,
815,0.97,5877.905,5882.643,"We'll be talking about this a lot more, I am sure, as we develop this.",136,,
816,0.97,5882.643,5885.479,Obviously we are not voting on it today.,136,,
817,0.97,5885.479,5893.42,Just make sure we don't bring forward any ordinances that would ban leading questions.,136,,
818,0.97,5893.42,5893.887,Will do.,137,,
819,0.97,5893.887,5894.355,Thank you.,137,,
820,0.97,5894.355,5895.956,"I appreciate it, director.",138,,
821,0.97,5895.956,5899.727,Thank you for your leadership on this.,138,,
822,0.97,5899.727,5920.214,"I am wondering if there is anybody at the table, perhaps central staff, who can speak a little bit to assuming legislation is passed, what steps would be as it relates to activating the Reopener?",139,,
823,0.97,5920.214,5940.134,I am assuming that we can begin discussions around the Spog contract separate from our larger negotiations about the next contract by merit of it being a Reopener.,139,,
824,0.97,5940.134,5945.973,I am assuming that a Reopener means you can take a piece of the contract to talk about it.,139,,
825,0.97,5945.973,5950.477,But I am not certain.,139,,
826,0.97,5950.477,5978.706,"Councilmember, I have the same understanding you do that by bargaining Reopener into the contract that the city has the right to raise that topic with the Union at any time although for practicality purposes, Spog negotiations are about to ensue and so it's possible that the city may just choose to roll that item into the upcoming negotiations.",140,,
827,0.97,5978.706,5993.954,I would ask law to jump in and clarify anything that I might have said here.,140,,
828,0.97,5993.954,5997.825,.,141,,
829,0.97,5997.825,6001.962,I would agree with everything just described.,142,,
830,0.97,6001.962,6028.422,"I would point out what is probably obvious to all that while the city can unilaterally raise the issue either through the Reopener and existing contract or as a new bargaining matter in the upcoming discussions for the next contract, both parties have to agree to the contract terms.",142,,
831,0.97,6028.422,6033.627,So we cannot unilaterally decide what will be included in the contract.,142,,
832,0.97,6033.627,6044.872,We can only unilaterally decide to enter through negotiations with our counterparts on the other side of the table.,142,,
833,0.97,6044.872,6046.006,Thank you.,143,,
834,0.97,6046.006,6049.143,Understood.,143,,
835,0.97,6049.143,6049.543,Other comments?,143,,
836,0.97,6049.543,6067.528,I think the question of whether or not to do this is part of the overall negotiations or as through the Reopener I think is a taxable question we'll need to discuss with the executive through the labor relations policy committee.,143,,
837,0.97,6067.528,6071.799,In consultation with our accountability partners who are advising us in that process.,143,,
838,0.97,6071.799,6078.338,I look forward to having those conversations.,143,,
839,0.97,6078.338,6109.703,"Councilmember Herbold, the only thing I might add, I agree with everything that Greg and Dan described here is that as part of the technical amendments, there was language added on the advice of the city attorneys office that we make this ordinance effective when the court APPROVES the ordinance and then 30 days or after 30 days after the Mayor signs it, whichever occurs later.",144,,
840,0.97,6109.703,6122.85,So we are presenting the ordinance to the Federal judge for his approval and then it will become effective once that approval and 30 days passage after the Mayor signs it.,144,,
841,0.97,6122.85,6132.159,Thank you for that addition and changes that we should expect to see.,145,,
842,0.97,6132.159,6137.231,When council meets in this committee to discuss the substitute.,145,,
843,0.97,6137.231,6152.112,"If there are no further questions or comments, I want to again echo thanks to everybody joining us here today as well as folks who are not at the table including the ACLU.",145,,
844,0.97,6152.112,6185.579,"As mentioned earlier, they were a really good partner in advocating very strongly for the most streamlined approach of issuance of Appeals and still observing the ability of folks to assert their privacy rights, you know, without sacrificing that process, a very streamlined appeal process, when we were talking about different options.",145,,
845,0.97,6185.579,6189.383,Their advocacy was really important for the option that we ultimately chose.,145,,
846,0.97,6189.383,6191.785,Many thanks to them as well.,145,,
847,0.97,6191.785,6196.023,"With that, thank you again for joining us.",145,,
848,0.97,6196.023,6199.092,Let's move on to the next item on the agenda.,145,,
849,0.97,6199.092,6202.896,"Alex, can you read it into the record please?",145,,
850,0.97,6202.896,6209.937,"Item number three, proposal for misdemeanor basic need defense.",146,,
851,0.97,6209.937,6216.843,"Thank you, Alex.",147,,
852,0.97,6216.843,6224.418,Start with quick introductions please.,147,,
853,0.97,6224.418,6224.985,Council central staff.,148,,
854,0.97,6224.985,6230.157,Other folks who are here with us today on this item?,149,,
855,0.97,6230.157,6231.558,City attorneys office.,150,,
856,0.97,6231.558,6233.36,Thank you.,151,,
857,0.97,6233.36,6238.131,Department of public defense.,152,,
858,0.97,6238.131,6241.101,Thank you all.,152,,
859,0.97,6241.101,6242.102,Let's see here.,152,,
860,0.97,6242.102,6264.057,"Before I turn it over, just again as background, remember in late October during the budget process, this proposal was briefly discussed after direction from other Council members and the Council President, we decided to take this item up after the budget process.",152,,
861,0.97,6264.057,6283.377,"The proposal that we are discussing today focuses on concept of creating a poverty defense, making meeting individuals' immediate basic need and affirmative defense to a crime.",152,,
862,0.97,6283.377,6285.679,It does not Decriminalize Misdemeanors.,152,,
863,0.97,6285.679,6288.015,It doesn't make Misdemeanors legal.,152,,
864,0.97,6288.015,6306.767,It is simply allowing for an affirmative defense to Misdemeanors and the decision around the adjudication of the case will be as it is now left to a judge or jury.,152,,
865,0.97,6306.767,6321.014,"Central staff's memo provides background to provide context about how an affirmative defense fits into the criminal legal system, identifies policy considerations for potential future bill, outlines next steps.",152,,
866,0.97,6321.014,6339.733,I just want to highlight that our city attorney has said in his letters attached to memo that he has worked to move city attorneys office away from prosecuting property crimes that appear to be committed out of survival necessity.,152,,
867,0.97,6339.733,6351.178,"It's not only a just choice by prosecutors, it is also one reinforced by Seattle jurors who are loathed convict for crimes out of pure necessity.",152,,
868,0.97,6351.178,6377.704,Our conversation isn't consideration of a dramatic new policy but one about Cotification of existing policy and allowing for defendants to make a defense to jurors and judges and allowing jurors and judges to make a decision based on full understanding of the circumstances.,152,,
869,0.97,6377.704,6398.125,We have both representative from city attorneys office as well as from the King County Department of public defense director Anita Concernedder wall and they K and help with our conversation.,152,,
870,0.97,6398.125,6401.628,Thank you for the memo.,152,,
871,0.97,6401.628,6424.184,"Hand it over to you, big picture, the memo explains some of the options and some of the process that is inherent to any case related to a misdemeanor arrest or a misdemeanor charge as context.",152,,
872,0.97,6424.184,6441.034,"My hope is that we can go through the options here, hear Council members interests or concerns and discuss next steps a the subsequent meetings.",152,,
873,0.97,6441.034,6451.311,With that I will hand it over.,152,,
874,0.97,6451.311,6451.945,Thank you.,152,,
875,0.97,6451.945,6453.346,Good morning.,153,,
876,0.97,6453.346,6455.682,The memo lays out basic context about how this works.,153,,
877,0.97,6455.682,6462.756,I want to note it's not a legal memo.,153,,
878,0.97,6462.756,6464.157,I tried to explain the concept.,153,,
879,0.97,6464.157,6471.665,If I end up going down the rabbit hole of Legallys feel free to interrupt me and I will try to explain concepts.,153,,
880,0.97,6471.665,6478.305,The other thing I wanted to note is where the memo FALLS in terms of legislative process.,153,,
881,0.97,6478.305,6488.281,The memo is very much a narrow look into what it would look like to draft this as initial concept.,153,,
882,0.97,6488.281,6498.492,Nuances of drafting legislation as you know can have big impacts on how a policy is implemented and how legislation practically operates.,153,,
883,0.97,6498.492,6508.802,So this memo is not so much about the wider policy impacts of what it would mean to codify such a defense into the code.,153,,
884,0.97,6508.802,6517.911,"Rather it's about going through the drafting process, specific nuances of drafting one way or the other in terms of how an affirmative defense would work.",153,,
885,0.97,6517.911,6533.226,"That's not to say that once we are further into this process, there won't be analysis of policy impacts of an eventual piece of legislation would look like.",153,,
886,0.97,6533.226,6537.297,There isn't introduced legislation so it is high level conversation about the concepts.,153,,
887,0.97,6537.297,6555.515,"That said, I will start with just some basic back ground for viewing public about how the system works and where affirmative defenses if it in and then we can get into the issues identified.",153,,
888,0.97,6555.515,6563.39,"When somebody commits an act that could be a crime, there are a couple stages in the legal system in which the individual can get involved.",153,,
889,0.97,6563.39,6569.763,"So in the first circumstance at the stage of arrest, police have discretion to arrest somebody for the actor not.",153,,
890,0.97,6569.763,6582.142,"Assuming that the police do arrest somebody, the Prosecutor then has discretion to decide whether to file charges based on that crime.",153,,
891,0.97,6582.142,6584.177,The Prosecutor can decide not to press charges.,153,,
892,0.97,6584.177,6589.249,"If he does do so, we move into what is a pretrial stage.",153,,
893,0.97,6589.249,6597.791,Prosecution files charges and a judge can choose to dismiss the case or it can refer an individual.,153,,
894,0.97,6597.791,6600.894,In something we have trial diversion for example.,153,,
895,0.97,6600.894,6604.898,Somebody can be diverted from normal course of trial to a diversion program.,153,,
896,0.97,6604.898,6615.542,"If the case does move to trial, prosecution has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an individual is guilty of the crime.",153,,
897,0.97,6615.542,6627.087,So they have to prove each of the elements of a crime and it is up to the judge and jury to decide whether prosecution has met that burden.,153,,
898,0.97,6627.087,6642.235,"The defendant basically argues that the prosecution did not meet the burden, that they did not prove each of the elements of the crime under reasonable doubt and this is where affirmative defense comes in and can assert defense.",153,,
899,0.97,6642.235,6658.752,Affirmative defense basically con seeds that the defendant did commit the crime but there is a justification or excuse for why the crime was committed that serves to excuse the defendant from criminal liability.,153,,
900,0.97,6658.752,6662.155,The Seattle municipal code currently contains a few affirmative defenses.,153,,
901,0.97,6662.155,6665.892,The one in the memo is defense of duress.,153,,
902,0.97,6665.892,6684.411,An individual has committed an act but essentially did so because they thought they were refusing to commit the crime would mean they would suffer from bodily injury or death and the fear of that is reasonable.,153,,
903,0.97,6684.411,6688.081,Other type of affirmative defense is common law.,153,,
904,0.97,6688.081,6697.29,Common law is basically interpretation of existing case law that isn't necessarily in a statute or ordinance but is still recognized as law.,153,,
905,0.97,6697.29,6703.897,And an example of that is the common law defense of necessity.,153,,
906,0.97,6703.897,6706.599,Basically you will see the factors listed in the memo.,153,,
907,0.97,6706.599,6711.237,A person committed a crime to avoid greater harm.,153,,
908,0.97,6711.237,6726.519,"Lastly, in terms of background, any affirmative defense that's brought in Seattle municipal court would be for misdemeanor since that is the jurisdiction over crimes--excuse me, jurisdiction that the court has over the class of crimes.",153,,
909,0.97,6726.519,6736.029,"If there are no questions about the context, I will move into the proposal itself.",153,,
910,0.97,6736.029,6748.942,And that is to determine how to codify an affirmative defense that would allow an individual to assert they committed a crime but did so in order to meet immediate basic need.,153,,
911,0.97,6748.942,6782.575,My understanding of the intent of this proposal is to provide a way for a defendant to exit the criminal legal system on the fact that the system itself is not really suited to meet the needs of those that are committing crimes of poverty and that involvement in the system can cause harm.,153,,
912,0.97,6782.575,6805.431,"As noted, city attorney has been exercising his discretion to not prosecute property crimes that appear to be committed because somebody is trying to meet survival needs but that is a different stage than what the affirmative defense would apply.",153,,
913,0.97,6805.431,6820.413,"If the Prosecutor does choose to for a crime, that can be a different city attorney moving forward or there is disagreement about whether the crime itself was committed out of a need to meet an immediate basic need.",153,,
914,0.97,6820.413,6830.957,You end up at the trial stage in which the defendant can assert this defense as a way for judge and jury to be able to listen to circumstances around which a person committed a crime.,153,,
915,0.97,6830.957,6839.499,"If there are no questions about that piece, I will move into issues identified.",153,,
916,0.97,6839.499,6867.66,"I mentioned as before, concept of the defense based on poverty might be straightforward but the way in which legislation itself is Crafted and specific nuances reflecting how this will work Procedurally and legally can be knew answered and can result very different substantive impacts including how easy it is for the defense to assert this defense.",153,,
917,0.97,6867.66,6870.396,"The defendant, excuse me, to assert the defense.",153,,
918,0.97,6870.396,6874.901,The first piece is about the location in the code.,153,,
919,0.97,6874.901,6891.718,"As of now, as I mentioned, affirmative defense of duress so it could potentially go into that existing defense which would mean a new definition essentially of what the duress affirmative defense includes.",153,,
920,0.97,6891.718,6913.172,"It is also possible to put it in a new section of the code, so create a new subsection in the chapter about legal criminal defenses or it can go somewhere else which with further research and engagement can figure out a new location for it.",153,,
921,0.97,6913.172,6929.956,If defense were included in duress legislation it would require a change in jury instructions which is what the judge provides to the jury to let them know how to weigh an affirmative defense in making a decision about whether a defendant is guilty or not.,153,,
922,0.97,6929.956,6949.442,"So that would require some changes in jury instructions if it got codified into a totally new section of the code, it's likely that new jury instructions would be required to be Crafted to reflect the new defense.",153,,
923,0.97,6949.442,6959.018,"There are a couple options either within existing duress defense in a new section of the code, criminal defense chapter, or another location all together.",153,,
924,0.97,6959.018,6983.776,"Your memo States there is a little bit of a difference about case law as well in that if we were to put it in the duress section of the code, there would be no case law to interpret because this would be a different type of duress than case law that's been established with existing duress.",154,,
925,0.97,6983.776,6994.52,That same challenge would exist if we put it in the criminal defense's chapter of the code as well.,154,,
926,0.97,6994.52,6995.722,Is that the case?,154,,
927,0.97,6995.722,6995.988,Yes.,155,,
928,0.97,6995.988,6996.356,That's right.,155,,
929,0.97,6996.356,7006.332,I think it just might be more confusing if it's within the duress.,155,,
930,0.97,7006.332,7008.835,It's in case law about what it means.,155,,
931,0.97,7008.835,7014.507,It would mean that the case law automatically doesn't apply as easily if that makes sense.,155,,
932,0.97,7014.507,7016.075,Thank you.,156,,
933,0.97,7016.075,7053.346,"If we can take a pause here, this seems like a location of t think affects the usefulness of the change, maybe we could hear a little bit from each John and Anita.",156,,
934,0.97,7053.346,7058.084,Do you want me to go first or Anita?,157,,
935,0.97,7058.084,7060.653,"John, thank you for offering to go first.",158,,
936,0.97,7060.653,7075.735,"I want to underscore as we've heard, you are here to talk about policy options from the perspective of the city attorney's office.",158,,
937,0.97,7075.735,7082.508,This does not--your engagement on this is not an endorsement of the proposal.,158,,
938,0.97,7082.508,7087.647,"Thank you, council member.",159,,
939,0.97,7087.647,7098.191,I am happy to offer some quick thoughts on half of the city attorney's office on the helpful memo.,159,,
940,0.97,7098.191,7127.22,"On these issues, our perspective is that city attorney Oklahomans is an elected official is committed to applying discretion in cases we charge and our office doesn't believe in charging true and necessity and everyone constitutes a necessity case but as a matter of principle.",159,,
941,0.97,7127.22,7132.525,We don't charge immediate necessity in Food-Type cases or things like that.,159,,
942,0.97,7132.525,7170.463,"So our view of this legislation is what we don't believe it's necessary, we're--if Council wants to legislate in this area, we're supportive of working with Council coming up with legislation that can create a workable affirmative defense consistent with the diversion programs and our efforts to be judicious about what cases we prosecute in the first place.",159,,
943,0.97,7170.463,7172.331,This isn't really duress.,159,,
944,0.97,7172.331,7176.269,Duress is something intentionally caused by a third party.,159,,
945,0.97,7176.269,7180.239,It wouldn't make sense to add as duress.,159,,
946,0.97,7180.239,7215.908,"She's correct about the case log confusion and a concept that's different from duress and looks more like necessity and in the letter that city attorney Holmes sent to Council at the beginning of the budget process, we had COT Fewing the common law necessity in defense of discussions with safe holders.",159,,
947,0.97,7217.176,7232.091,"Meeting a basic immediate need of defense and we believe if this is going to happen, it should go at some place in the code to reflect that it is a unique affirmative defense against anything that currently exists.",159,,
948,0.97,7232.091,7289.682,"Our preference is to limit to necessity of crimes and Shoplifting, certain types of theft and trespass and be really careful that it applies to direct theft rather than theft for resale and could create intense consequences and as an affirmative defense, our perspective is that the defendant, this is why the defendant took a particular action and the defendant should have the burden of the establishing they committed the crime to immediate an Comedobasic need and then that could be Vetted by the Prosecutor and all the evidence could be committed to making the case based on all of the evidence.",159,,
949,0.97,7289.682,7298.958,So keeping this limited in a way without any unintended consequences but would accomplish the policy objectives that Council and stake holders are talking about.,159,,
950,0.97,7298.958,7328.22,"This is something we think is within the realm of possibility, but we'd urge Council to carefully frame this not into something like duress with the concept and duress and make sure that it's Taylored to cover the kinds of cases that Councilments it to cover and wouldn't necessarily go beyond that and I'm happy to answer questions or talk further but I think that's our initial presentation.",159,,
951,0.97,7328.22,7331.123,"Thank you, John.",160,,
952,0.97,7331.123,7332.091,You jumped ahead.,160,,
953,0.97,7332.091,7344.003,I was hoping to go through each of the issues identified in the issue Id and then hear from both the city attorney and public defense but that's okay.,160,,
954,0.97,7344.003,7352.044,You gave us a sort of good preview for what we're going to hear more from Asha about.,160,,
955,0.97,7352.044,7369.662,"Anita, do you want to respond or hold the comments around the different issues for those particular issues and maybe just start off with responding to the issue of where in the code?",160,,
956,0.97,7369.662,7378.17,"Sure, I think the honest truth is we don't have a strong preference on where in the code.",161,,
957,0.97,7378.17,7389.782,"I think jury instructions state the law and regardless of where we put this, we will develop a set of jury instructions will be developed by attorneys that's standard practice in all cases anyway.",161,,
958,0.97,7389.782,7396.122,I'm not--I don't think that that's a very material issue.,161,,
959,0.97,7396.122,7435.861,"I think from our perspective, what's really critical is that they're going on what current case law needs to reflect the value not wanting to address their immediate needs and we don't--we want jurors to hear the full story, the placement and the code doesn't matter at all.",161,,
960,0.97,7435.861,7447.907,"But we just want a opportunity for the jury to hear the facts of the case from the community and for the community to make a decision, and I just don't think existing case law gets us there.",161,,
961,0.97,7447.907,7453.479,"So that's, I think, sort of where the larger disagreement is between us in the city attorney's office.",161,,
962,0.97,7453.479,7459.151,"On the issue of placement in the code, we rarely differ.",161,,
963,0.97,7459.151,7459.418,Okay.,162,,
964,0.97,7459.418,7460.085,That's good to hear.,162,,
965,0.97,7460.085,7467.626,I had been under the impression from earlier discussions that that was a point of contention.,162,,
966,0.97,7467.626,7476.001,"Asha, do you want to move onto elements of the defense options?",162,,
967,0.97,7476.001,7476.268,Sure.,163,,
968,0.97,7476.268,7500.559,So the Brassic concept here was basic concept service they were committing a crime to meet a basic need and depending on more elements to the affirmative defense it requires that the party needs to prove all of those elements for the defense to be able to apply.,164,,
969,0.97,7500.559,7525.15,"For example, if the only thing that the Council wants the defendant to be able to prove is that they were participating in the crime in order to meet that basic need and the defendant would have to prove that they--the needs they had fit within the definition of immediate basic need, that they committed the crime in order to meet it.",164,,
970,0.97,7525.15,7561.62,"On the other hand you have as John mentioned, there is some similarity here to the common law necessity defense and if the Council's policy was that they wanted the defendant to have to prove both that they committed the crime, that makes the increased burden on the defendant to have to prove both and committed the crime to meet the basic immediate need as well as the fact that there's no reasonable alternative to doing so.",164,,
971,0.97,7561.62,7608.033,"Depending on what that particular element looks like, that can change what it is that the defendant actually has to prove so if it is just that there was no reasonable alternative, than it would be what actual alternatives existed, were they reasonable, and all the information that would have to go into making that determination but if it was the defendant didn't know about a reasonable alternative, then you have to get into whether the defendant actually knew about a reasonable alternative or the defendant shuld have known getting into what a reasonable person would have known what a reasonable alternative is.",164,,
972,0.97,7608.033,7687.479,"As we add more elements, it does increase the burden and then depending on how the additional elements are included in the legislation, you get to all of the different pieces of how you would go about proving that element and so that doesn't get into upon whom the burden lies to prove that element, which will be into the next section here and the options laid out here speak to just the example of reasonable alternatives so that first option would just require that the defendant proves they had an immediate basic need and committed a crime to satisfy it and could require an option be both those factors as well as proving the defendant had no reasonable alternative to committing the crime and then option C speaks to either having a or B and if there's any additional elements for example if there are other things from the necessity defense that would go into this new defense, or the last option D, some other version of the existing elements we're discussing and that could be further flushed out with further research and engagement.",164,,
973,0.97,7687.479,7719.845,"And my recollection is that thus far, there is agreement that the elements of the defense option could be having an immediate basic need and Noology Terntive to committing the crime and lack of alignment is around the Buren of proof for establishing the no reasonable alternative to committing the crime.",165,,
974,0.97,7719.845,7720.846,Is that more or less correct?,165,,
975,0.97,7720.846,7727.186,As to who would have to prove the no reasonable alternative piece.,166,,
976,0.97,7727.186,7747.873,"So if my recollection of the Cao and public defense positions on that are correct, let's move to the burden of proof question.",167,,
977,0.97,7747.873,7766.759,"As with mentioned, depending on who holds the burden of proof, if we're talking about no reasonable alternative element, if the desire is for the defendant to have to prove that they had no reasonable alternative, that does increase the burden on the defendant.",168,,
978,0.97,7766.759,7793.418,"On the other hand if it is the prosecution proving there was no reasonable alternative, there are a couple potential ways, one more theoretical than the other, but theoretically you could have the prosecution proving in trying to prove initial burden that for each crime, the defendant commit it had and there was no reasonable alternative to committing the crime in order to meet the person's basic needs.",168,,
979,0.97,7793.418,7808.033,Procedurally the other way to do it would be for the prosecution to prove the,168,,
980,0.97,7818.911,7822.314,That facts would defeat the affirmative defense.,169,,
981,0.97,7822.314,7852.277,"The--if the no reasonable alternative piece was part of the--what the defendant had to prove as part of the affirmative defense, they would have to prove as I mentioned both the piece around meeting the immediate basic need and there was no reasonable alternative, and then it's possible that the prosecution could come back and say there was in fact a reasonable alternative but they wouldn't have the burden of proving as much.",169,,
982,0.97,7852.277,7880.672,Options laid out are essentially either replacing burden on the defendant or that is option A. the option B would be having the Prosecutor having to prove the no reasonable alternative piece or the third option is figuring out some other allocation of burden for the other elements.,169,,
983,0.97,7880.672,7881.473,Thank you.,170,,
984,0.97,7881.473,7912.504,I just want to also underscore and it creates a new burden for the defendant with a preponderance of defendant and basic need fulfilled by evidence.,170,,
985,0.97,7912.504,7917.976,The preponderance of evidence standard is that the claim is more probably true than not.,171,,
986,0.97,7917.976,7930.889,"I think if it's more than 50% true, that would satisfy the burden but please feel free to Re-Flesh me, attorneys, if that's not the correct statement of the burden.",171,,
987,0.97,7930.889,7959.084,If we could hear from--we've heard from the city attorney John ticket and we've heard from Anita on the alternative and very quickly the last couple issues identified here are pretty straightforward and we can move forward.,172,,
988,0.97,7959.084,7989.915,"I want to just remind the Council of who the clients are that we represent but 90% of individuals that go through SMC qualify for public defenders and they're individuals and to put the burden on them of proving that there wasn't a reasonable alternative in a system that is already, you know, so harmful to our clients just is not in keeping at all with the spirit of what we were trying to push for here.",173,,
989,0.97,7989.915,8002.027,"When everyone in our community has enough to eat and shelter from L element their basic human needs are met, we'll applaud the elements of the law and not use this defense at all.",173,,
990,0.97,8002.027,8032.624,"Till that time, I think cities should frankly embrace the opportunity to show there was a reasonable alternative and let jurors make a decision but to place that burden on a indigent individual trying to meet their needs to show that there wasn't something nearby seems to just sort of go in the same direction that our criminal legal system has always been in, which is Burdening the individual's who Norensnared within it.",173,,
991,0.97,8032.624,8058.383,"So quickly just to clarify, I think I understand what director Kevin is saying with respect of the need to prove whether there's an alternative or not but I think it's important to note that with the defendant's standard here would be is something within the defendant's knowledge and isn't something that's unreasonable for anyone to establish.",174,,
992,0.97,8058.383,8070.762,For example if you're dealing with a trespass case where a defendant trespassed somewhere because they didn't have anywhere else to Slee that was undercover.,174,,
993,0.97,8070.762,8109.0,All but putting the burden on the defendant would require is for the defendant to testify and say that they weren't aware of a shelter that they could go to or there were shelters but they couldn't get into them because they have a service animal because those shelters were Ofen full for any number of reasons and the defendant had not exhausted search of where the shelters are and in this sort of example but really say that they thought through is there a legal way I could satisfy this basic need and I was aware of one and that's why I did this.,174,,
994,0.97,8109.0,8123.782,Is that something that's a thought process between the defendant's knowledge and argues that the defendant's in the best place to say that and establish that initial burden.,174,,
995,0.97,8123.782,8149.274,"It can be rebutted on what it says and can make the decision and we're look at the goal of people being able to satisfy their immediate basic needs but we do think that at the end of the day, it's fair to ask the defendants to explore and satisfy their need for committing a crime to do so using the defense.",174,,
996,0.97,8149.274,8150.709,"Thank you, John.",175,,
997,0.97,8150.709,8163.788,My goal for this is for Council members and the public to get a sort of high level perspective of the different elements of the bill.,175,,
998,0.97,8163.788,8203.528,"We're not gonNA resolve the issues here, but I do want to flag that I think the memo that Asha's written talks about no reasonable alternative and we don't talk about no knowledge of a reasonable alternative so that--I don't know if there is potential there to get alignment by inserting the concept of knowledge of a reasonable alternative rather than the existence of a reasonable alternative but let's put a pin in that and we'll continue to talk about that item and Asha, can you move on to the next issue in the issue paper.",175,,
999,0.97,8203.528,8235.627,"So next issue talks about the applicability of the defense to all Misdemeanors and a couple ways in which all the defense can apply and the first is they term inclusive approach is that it applies to all Misdemeanors with a few, if any, exceptions at all, which means the defendant would have the option of raising the defense no matter which crime the defendant is charged with.",176,,
1000,0.97,8235.627,8243.668,"Advice of Council about whether it makes sense to assert the defense, whether defense is applicable at that juncture based on the facts.",176,,
1001,0.97,8243.668,8265.857,The other approach would be what I termed exclusive approach and that approach--delivery.,176,,
1002,0.97,8265.857,8270.161,"So sorry, apologies.",177,,
1003,0.97,8270.161,8315.607,An exclusive approach would be the applicability of the defense to a few specific Misdemeanors and so it would mean that the defendant could only raise the defense in the circumstance that they are charged with those specific Misdemeanors in which the defense is applicable and is Factually applicable to the charge and they'd only be allowed to raise it in specific list of crimes to which it is legally applicable.,177,,
1004,0.97,8315.607,8317.075,Real quickly.,178,,
1005,0.97,8317.075,8320.679,"Anita and John, your thoughts on this element?",178,,
1006,0.97,8320.679,8355.714,There's no other affirmative defenses or rather other affirmative defenses are not limited to how they apply to murder and why we'd need to do something different here and I think--so for example you wouldn't be able to use Self- defense in a fraud case and there's no written exclusion statutorily written exclusion and I would like to see us treat this the same way.,179,,
1007,0.97,8355.714,8360.218,I don't see a reason to treat it differently.,179,,
1008,0.97,8360.218,8369.494,"So I don't think, I would say, you know, our strong Perches here is the inclusive approach and not the exclusive approach.",179,,
1009,0.97,8369.494,8373.565,"And then again, in is about trusting in our juries and letting them hear.",179,,
1010,0.97,8373.565,8392.283,"If they hear that someone stole $500 worth of stuff to, I don't even know, our juries will be able to understand why someone is trying to meet an immediate need and why they're not and I don't think we need to treat this legislation different than other affirmative defenses.",179,,
1011,0.97,8392.283,8397.088,The basic need for the defense limits the context to which it can be applied.,179,,
1012,0.97,8397.088,8411.136,And the case that the edges in the margin are arguing the jury and letting the jury decide.,179,,
1013,0.97,8411.136,8411.569,"Yeah, sorry.",180,,
1014,0.97,8411.569,8433.158,I think our perspective on this is to apply to violent crimes or left for resale or property destruction which would be inconsistent with using something to satisfy media and basic need and then it makes sense to statutorily exclude those.,180,,
1015,0.97,8433.158,8449.174,"If there are fact patterns where stake holders or advocates make sense for a crime other than theft for direct use and trespass, we're happy to kind of discuss what those concepts are.",180,,
1016,0.97,8449.174,8453.144,A jury would never apply this in an assault case.,180,,
1017,0.97,8453.144,8465.89,We don't want this to apply to assault and this doesn't apply to assault.,180,,
1018,0.97,8465.89,8481.573,They're Trespassing like more stake holders and look through a list of charges and might make sense to think there where there's a desire for a supply and exclusively limited.,180,,
1019,0.97,8481.573,8481.973,Thank you.,181,,
1020,0.97,8481.973,8489.414,"Anita, last item.",182,,
1021,0.97,8489.414,8491.883,Last item.,183,,
1022,0.97,8491.883,8493.384,I figured.,184,,
1023,0.97,8493.384,8540.865,The last item here is whether the defense should apply to resale of goods or not and so without any limitation that's specific to state not applying to resale goods or making sure that basic Immediat needs is specifically defined and potential this could apply to an example of somebody stole a bunch of cell phones and intended to resell them to pay their rent and options are really figuring out if Council does want the defense to apply in the circumstances then making sure that the legislation reflects that.,184,,
1024,0.97,8540.865,8566.758,"If the desire is not to have the--excuse me, the defense apply to those cases of resell, then just making sure that it's the scope of the defense is limited in that way or it's very clear that immediate basic need doesn't mean items--excuse me, basic immediate need doesn't mean those needs that are--that could be met later on given how much time it would take to resell an item.",184,,
1025,0.97,8566.758,8569.727,Those are the options laid out as AB.,184,,
1026,0.97,8569.727,8571.162,Thank you.,185,,
1027,0.97,8571.162,8611.135,"My recollection of the conversation was that the defense and advocates had argued that they believed that the language immediate basic need Adherently would prohibit the utility of the defense in a resell situation and there might be some alignment on the intent, but some conversation that's still necessary to find out whether or not the language meets the intent.",185,,
1028,0.97,8611.135,8612.837,Any thoughts about that?,185,,
1029,0.97,8612.837,8643.301,"You know, I think in many ways the same question sort of a number identifies if they're related to number four, this question of inclusive or not inclusive, and I think ultimately again with other defenses, there isn't a lot of language that Carves out and not going to apply to X, Y, and Z. the defense is there and then a person charged with the crime can decide whether to raise that defense or not.",186,,
1030,0.97,8643.301,8646.104,Ultimately I think we have to trust our juries.,186,,
1031,0.97,8646.104,8658.282,"We can't imagine sort of the endless Permeation of facts that may come up, but we do know that we can and should trust our community members to determine what is a basic need.",186,,
1032,0.97,8658.282,8702.16,"What is an immediate basic need, and we shouldn't fear the possibility of people trying to tell this story and again, this is in the larger context of the fact that when we convict people of a crime and subject them to Incarceration, that should be an extraordinary thing that we're doing and not common place and it is so harmful to the people in the system and as we know the system is also incredibly racially disproportionate and finding ways to slow down the machinery of the system is critically important in giving jurors the opportunity to hear stories and exercise judgment about what the difference is between a basic need and Profiteering is where we should be headed.",186,,
1033,0.97,8702.16,8709.934,I think I agree that this is fairly similar to whether it should be limited by the crime that it applies to.,187,,
1034,0.97,8709.934,8725.383,"At the end of the day, our view on it is similar in that if Advocateds and stake holders where it should be applied to assault.",187,,
1035,0.97,8725.383,8754.212,"Not thinking of fact patterns where it should be applied to theft resale and exclusively carve out theft for resale and immediate basic need and theft for direct use but given concerns about this on the other side, counsel's going to legislate in this arena.",187,,

1049,0.97,8917.775,8928.586,"I want to list the ten specific concerns, which I hope will be helpful as the deliberate process Copts on this.",190,,
1050,0.97,8928.586,8952.243,Reimagining public safety has to include preventing crime and police accountability and respecting each other rather than enabling individuals to enable crime and conduct and basic laws that sets standards in an act with each other.,190,,
1051,0.97,8952.243,8996.687,And they're not making communities safer and made sense and they were meant to protect one's Self-And I'm concerned that reducing laws meant to protect each other and we need to create two advantages and Trespassing and Shoplifters and the results of the brand new community led Participatory budget next year and implementation and reform.,190,,
1052,0.97,8996.687,9048.372,See how this works and the Council is immersed and time consuming and distracting debate over whether we're the first city in the U.S. to weaken local laws that protect each other and once again it seems we would be proceeding with an unconventional and Uncontested clear plan and the unfortunate incident that was called chop where Seattle became in the eyes of many a national embarrassment and I'm deeply concerned that such unconventional Non-Contested proposal before us today could have a negative impact that Reverberates beyond City Hall bubble in the boundaries of our city and negatively Impacting police reform efforts that we want to see enacted at state level and Olympia next year and U.S. Senate election and Georgia in control of the Senate and future Supreme Court nominations hang in the ball Los.,190,,

1055,0.97,9077.535,9092.883,I'm concerned that watering down a law and creating a restitution fund for victims are like saying you can run a red light if you're late for work and worried you'll lose your job and we'll use tax dollars to create a fund for car crash victims.,191,,
1056,0.97,9092.883,9100.991,We say proposed legislation Ãšmust have stake holder input and in this Caseworks I strongly believe the general Ãšp a key stake holders.,191,,

1062,0.97,9148.939,9161.352,The memo before us does not say whether any other cities have experimented with expanding affirmative defenses to crimes.,191,,
1063,0.97,9161.352,9163.187,And we can learn from it.,191,,

1065,0.97,9180.804,9183.607,Would this apply just to Seattle residents?,191,,

1067,0.97,9193.617,9196.253,I'm not sure this was needed right now.,191,,
1068,0.97,9196.253,9209.433,Our--at least for that 1-5 years because the existing city attorney is--has already acknowledged in his October 30 memo he does not prosecute for crimes of poverty.,191,,
1069,0.97,9209.433,9218.108,It's also not needed right now because defendants can already use the common law defense as a necessity as the city attorney points out in his memo.,191,,
1070,0.97,9218.108,9229.753,I urge the chair and members of this committee to table this idea till after the state Legislature concludes it's spring session.,191,,
1071,0.97,9229.753,9230.087,Thank you.,191,,
1072,0.97,9230.087,9232.823,"Thank you, council member Peterson.",192,,
1073,0.97,9232.823,9312.636,I feel like much of the arguments you have made are really based on this--so I really think that understanding this proposal as a proposal that is really based on transparency and giving people a opportunity to tell their stories and giving judges and juries a decision based on the values of our city and on their understanding of what the facts are.,192,,
1074,0.97,9312.636,9328.552,I really think that that understanding of the proposal addresses a lot of concerns that you've raised but I look forward to having additional conversations and additional stake holder engagement as we move forward.,192,,
1075,0.97,9328.552,9334.224,Thank you so much.,192,,

1079,0.97,9341.131,9350.974,"I want to start with my comments and say, you know, I appreciate a lot of concerns that Council member Petersen raised associated with delving into this territory.",193,,
1080,0.97,9350.974,9358.082,I do think it's important that we all not Prejudge a proposal.,193,,
1081,0.97,9433.757,9436.927,You're saying I did it but listen to this.,194,,
1082,0.97,9436.927,9480.204,"I wonder if the burden is not on the defense, what--I guess I wonder what the process would be necessity defense or element and what the crime is and expectation that the burden is on the prosecution and the defense would need to make a showing and put something in contention for the city to disprove.",194,,
1083,0.97,9480.204,9512.536,"Just in terms of mechanics of how an affirmative defense works, unless the defense put something out there into contention for the city to have to grapple with in their rebuttal, I don't see how if the burden was on the city to essentially disprove it beyond any reasonable doubt, what we're essentially disproving if we don't even know--if the defense has not put anything in there to make--to be able to make that--put that in contention.",194,,
1084,0.97,9512.536,9523.78,"If they were the case, we were expecting the city to just Preemptively disprove it, I would think that would essentially add an additional element to whatever the crime is.",194,,
1085,0.97,9523.78,9546.97,"Like it would be like proving for theft for example that the person took something from, you know, a store that they did it with the intent of permanently depriving the person of the item that they left the store and that when they did it, it was not to meet a immediate basic need.",194,,
1086,0.97,9546.97,9552.009,We wouldn't get a basic immediate need.,194,,
1087,0.97,9552.009,9578.669,That's my initial thinking of going through the hearing here and how it would work in practice and if it was on the city and it seems to me they could odd another element but truck structures that way.,194,,
1088,0.97,9623.08,9626.817,What would that be in the form of?,195,,
1089,0.97,9626.817,9646.37,Would a defendant essentially testify to assert that but after that showing the burden would be on the city to come back and have to basically disprove the testimony and if the burden is on the city.,195,,
1090,0.97,9646.37,9648.872,I don't know what.,195,,
1091,0.97,9756.613,9758.849,Any're comments or thoughts?,196,,

1096,0.97,9799.356,9807.297,Just want to do one more quick check for the good of the order before we adjourn.,196,,
