65,0.97,390.389,410.51,"I think the crime, now past system, has been far too bureaucratic in its nature, and buildings that fully, you know, meet code and standard, are still rejected on basis of character or some other, you know, reasoning.",18,,
66,0.97,410.51,428.294,"I find that given a building meets code and is a net and if it for a community, and housing, especially housing to a community, I think that it should be able to go through easier and faster than it currently is.",18,,
67,0.97,428.294,450.149,"I also believe with a more bureaucratic system in place, I believe it can be, housing can be subject to, I do not want to say manipulation, but a lobbying system that slows down introduction of housing, which can negatively harm housing supply and cause more and more homelessness.",18,,
68,0.97,450.149,463.062,"I just want to wish this Department the best and infighting that slowdown of new construction, and, you know, developing a better housing for Seattle overall.",18,,

99,0.97,619.485,641.34,"And I will say that the mission of our office is to improve the lives of Seattle's immigrant and refugee communities, by engaging them in decisions on Seattle's future, ensuring the city's programs and services equitably meet their needs.",25,,

104,0.97,669.335,670.903,"So, moving on.",25,,
105,0.97,670.903,673.839,We are a small office.,25,,
106,0.97,673.839,693.225,"We are just 11 FTE, 2022 budget, and we cover a range of programmatic work, to deal with citizenship, employment, legal services, what we will focus on today is primarily our 2021 responses to three major crises.",25,,

108,0.97,697.496,703.402,"These were continuing from 2020, but we added a strong new tool and focus, as you can imagine, vaccines.",25,,
109,0.97,703.402,710.142,"All of our work focuses on equity, we always begin with community.",25,,
110,0.97,710.142,722.388,But in 2021 in particular we were challenged to take our small community responses and scale them up as we were routed in community.,25,,
111,0.97,722.388,724.724,Luckily with our small size we can be responsive and innovative.,25,,
112,0.97,724.724,729.361,And we apply that to three things that we will talk about early.,25,,
113,0.97,729.361,735.267,We will talk a little bit about our immigration crisis response at the end of the presentation.,25,,
114,0.97,735.267,747.613,The three main focuses we will have today are outreach and referral strategies to get vaccines to Dis-Apportionment impacted communities including the immigrant communities.,25,,
115,0.97,747.613,763.095,"The work that we did on Seattle relief Fund, to get relief into folks' hands, 25 million in collaboration with Hsd, allocated for this purpose.",25,,

121,0.97,798.697,802.501,What was then talking about our plan for equitable vaccine outreach.,26,,
122,0.97,802.501,810.376,I am happy to report that despite the lows of the pandemic our fight for equity did have a number of highs.,26,,

125,0.97,823.455,835.901,Despite the short Timeline we had three discussions with immigrant leaders to help inform the vaccine strategy.,26,,
126,0.97,835.901,836.502,Next Sli.,26,,
127,0.97,836.502,841.006,It led to our primary goal to ensure that Seattle's fall durable Bipoc residents have access to vaccines.,26,,
128,0.97,841.006,846.078,To help reach the goal we set on the three strategies listed here.,26,,

146,0.97,970.502,985.25,"I will not read the full quote from a vaccine outreach partner but we heard repeatedly that the person-to-person invoice to voiced, text message to text message was key to countering the false information that continues today Unfortunately.",26,,

172,0.97,1136.168,1150.849,"The Seattle relief fund was funded at $25 million level by Council to provide direct cash assistance to low income Seattle households, who experienced the economic impacts.",27,,
173,0.97,1150.849,1153.452,And those disproportionately Ipacted by the public health crisis.,27,,
174,0.97,1153.452,1157.055,"So there were two phases, to the Rollout of funds.",27,,
175,0.97,1157.055,1166.498,"In 2020, we had Administrated the Seattle disaster relief fund for immigrants.",27,,
176,0.97,1166.498,1177.142,Which brought $1000- $3000 relief awards to people who had been unable to access Federal relief or state fund employment.,27,,
177,0.97,1177.142,1212.945,"And this phase one of the 2021 Seattle relief Fund, was then Recertifying those folks who had received awards and were still eligible because of the bear income and their Seattle Nexis, living in Seattle, a handful of workers are students in Seattle, and we managed to accomplish that to reach all of our award recipients and Recertify so that we sent out almost $6 million in $1000 and $3000 rewards.",27,,
178,0.97,1212.945,1224.59,"And then phase two was a huge second phase that we did in partnership with not only Hsd but departments across the city, and Idt.",27,,
179,0.97,1224.59,1234.032,"For immigrants and low income residents of Seattle, to build on the success of being able to reach out to folks in our Strs.",27,,
180,0.97,1234.032,1248.747,Noting that the phase one recipients were not eligible and residents could apply for phase two also but not anyone that received money in the first draft.,27,,
181,0.97,1248.747,1257.956,So I will mention that the full report and the executive summary on this will be available at the end of February.,27,,
182,0.97,1257.956,1259.591,With all kinds of analysis and so forth.,27,,
183,0.97,1259.591,1261.426,I will just hit the high points here.,27,,
184,0.97,1261.426,1263.095,And we will make the report available upon request.,27,,
185,0.97,1263.095,1266.965,And then broadly publicly available as well once it is complete.,27,,
186,0.97,1266.965,1272.638,So as I mentioned we were Partnering with Hs D and 10 departments around the city.,27,,
187,0.97,1272.638,1278.01,"We started with, community, hearing from the community.",27,,
188,0.97,1278.01,1279.645,What was the need?,27,,
189,0.97,1279.645,1290.589,What was the way that we should define our priority categories knowing that with as much money as we had we did not have nearly enough to meet need.,27,,
190,0.97,1290.589,1298.597,"We worked with a partner that we worked with successfully to administer funds, to actually process the responses to applications and then to make the awards.",27,,
191,0.97,1298.597,1301.867,It was a scholar Fund.,27,,
192,0.97,1301.867,1316.882,"And then we engaged 46 partners to conduct outreach in language application assistance, for folks who needed extra help to make sure that the low barrier application was filled out correctly.",27,,
193,0.97,1316.882,1319.818,We did all of this in nine different languages.,27,,
194,0.97,1319.818,1325.824,"In media, eight Efferent languages in terms of translated materials.",27,,
195,0.97,1325.824,1330.762,And we put a bunch of safeguards in place because we know that there can be up bad actors and we learn to prevent that.,27,,
196,0.97,1330.762,1347.612,"We learned with a 13 point system, then expended expanded cash to some who we could be sure that those that truly received the assistance were truly eligible and in need.",27,,
197,0.97,1347.612,1352.317,"There were almost 64,000 applications received for the second round.",27,,
198,0.97,1352.317,1353.719,Dispersing more than $60 million.,27,,
199,0.97,1353.719,1370.068,"And I will just say a word here, on the pie chart, so, in order to be eligible for the funding, you needed to have a sale Nexis, that was primarily residents in Seattle.",27,,
200,0.97,1370.068,1392.624,"Of those who received the cash assistance and almost 99% were Seattle residents, if people said that they were Seattle residents, then we did not go on to ask them the questions about whether they might qualify because they had a Seattle student in their household or because they had a Workspace as an artist or cultural worker within Seattle.",27,,
201,0.97,1392.624,1402.267,So that just over 1% is fully folks that did not live in Seattle.,27,,
202,0.97,1402.267,1409.608,There maybe of course many other artists or Seattle students within the Seattle resident category.,27,,
203,0.97,1409.608,1418.95,"We had a number of priority factors, that we used to measure people's vulnerability and need.",27,,
204,0.97,1418.95,1428.627,"Many people hitting many of these categories, unstable housing and loss of income or job being highest percentages.",27,,
205,0.97,1428.627,1437.035,"The vast majority of folks who eventually received the $1000- $3000 awards, suffered.",27,,
206,0.97,1441.039,1444.609,We had a really broad racial demographic.,28,,
207,0.97,1444.609,1448.346,These are not overlapping categories.,28,,
208,0.97,1448.346,1461.593,"As you can see, I will mention that 31% of our applications that were assisted with were in language, a language other than English.",28,,
209,0.97,1461.593,1465.263,"And we heard wonderful results from the community, we are just mentioning a couple anecdotal ones here.",28,,
210,0.97,1465.263,1479.811,"I will not read these quotes but really people who were in dire situations, on the brink of Eviction, having bills piling up, we were able to give at least some small amount of relief.",28,,
211,0.97,1479.811,1488.854,"We managed to get it out before the holidays, which, putting the money into almost all the hands of people who are awarded.",28,,
212,0.97,1488.854,1497.829,Úand so we know that it made a big difference for folks.,28,,
213,0.97,1497.829,1501.132,"Re-You really sauce Seattle inaction here, a strong collaboration with the community and our outreach partners.",28,,
214,0.97,1501.132,1509.441,Strong relationships that we build within the city to make sure we could get this done as quickly and security as possible.,28,,
215,0.97,1509.441,1524.789,And we very much availed our mission as immigrant refugee affairs to make sure language access was at the forefront of this so people were able to access this regardless of their ability to speak English.,28,,
216,0.97,1524.789,1533.398,"Okay, so reading on, moving onto language access.",28,,
217,0.97,1533.398,1549.915,I will say that the language access program has been around a little while but the executive order that really made it a strong citywide practice came in 2017.,28,,
218,0.97,1549.915,1555.754,"And we have been slowly moving towards cultural shifts, direct investments.",28,,
219,0.97,1555.754,1559.758,Covid-19 made a huge emphasis on that.,28,,
220,0.97,1559.758,1569.834,"Because it was so important to be able to get out timely information, accurate information, in languages that folks could understand.",28,,
221,0.97,1569.834,1582.08,"And so in some ways it has been an opportunity for us to really Embed these practices and skills throughout the city, as different departments took roles and Covid response.",28,,
222,0.97,1582.08,1587.752,"And so, some things that have happened, just in the past year, a centralized translation system.",28,,
223,0.97,1587.752,1615.981,"So instead of individualized departments either contracting with a vendor, that does all kinds of languages, but maybe not locally based, or having to find their own individual Translators that speak, local and speak local versions of different languages, they are able to do that centrally.",28,,
224,0.97,1615.981,1625.357,And then the Translators are able to get their payments not from individual city departments but one lump sum for each set of month work they do.,28,,
225,0.97,1625.357,1640.438,"In order to back that up of course we have established the community translator team, 50+ local translator so that we have the capacity to quickly respond to all of the needs.",28,,
226,0.97,1640.438,1672.07,"Also, for the first time for the 2023-24 cycle, of budget, we worked with departments that have had different language access plans that really talk about their need and they're studying so far and held the need will be met, what will be needed to meet to translate and communicate and all of those languages, to their audience in 23-24.",28,,
227,0.97,1672.07,1681.68,And a key backbone of this is the city language access liaison network.,28,,
228,0.97,1681.68,1684.115,"All of the departments that are meeting, understanding best practices and needs.",28,,
229,0.97,1684.115,1694.159,Not just for translation and interpretation but communicating in all the languages that our Seattle community speaks.,28,,
230,0.97,1694.159,1698.296,I have put tools here that I don't need to cover.,28,,
231,0.97,1698.296,1705.303,With that I will go back to Joaquin.,28,,
232,0.97,1705.303,1707.605,Thanks Katherine.,29,,
233,0.97,1707.605,1723.988,"I would like to conclude the presentation by briefly discussing the presentation last year, undoing the damage that the Trump administration brought upon immigrant and refugee residents.",29,,
234,0.97,1723.988,1729.561,"Trump was no longer the President last year, his policies and rhetoric continued to have far-reaching effects on immigrant communities in Seattle.",29,,
235,0.97,1729.561,1750.815,"What this means for Oira, instead of publishing records, we started writing comments in support of Pro-Immigrant and reversing the charge order, increasing refugee admission caps to levels before the Trump administration.",29,,
236,0.97,1750.815,1768.133,"Last year we continued the national leadership on a number of Pro-Leadership actions, including opposing the DOJ's court docket, this would erode due process for families seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border.",29,,
237,0.97,1768.133,1785.583,"We also continued in cities for action and cities for citizenship, propelling Seattle to become VANGUARD of cities across the nation that defendant immigrant and refugee residents and stood against the Trump administration.",29,,
238,0.97,1785.583,1792.724,"Lastly we were proud to submit our four racial equity Toolkits, which included our Seattle relief Fund and Covid vaccine outreach.",29,,
239,0.97,1792.724,1796.461,Work.,29,,
240,0.97,1796.461,1800.598,This concludes our presentation and we are happy to take questions.,29,,
241,0.97,1800.598,1801.566,To I.,29,,
242,0.97,1801.566,1802.8,Thanks so much both of you.,30,,
243,0.97,1802.8,1808.139,I have a couple question then I am happy to open it up to my colleagues if they want to Chime in about anything.,30,,
244,0.97,1808.139,1810.008,You don't have numbers on your Slis.,30,,
245,0.97,1810.008,1827.392,"So I am going to say the Covid vaccination community help lines, I have it as Sli 8. so, you mentioned, I think this was the right, that the program is funded through February.",30,,
246,0.97,1827.392,1830.428,Which is just next month.,30,,
247,0.97,1830.428,1836.768,"And is providing really important service, especially since we are still in this.",30,,
248,0.97,1836.768,1844.709,And really want to make sure everybody has access to the information that they need to be able to access and feel comfortable Accessing vaccination.,30,,
249,0.97,1844.709,1854.586,"Can you talk a little bit about what happens at the end of February, if we cannot figure out the funding situation?",30,,
250,0.97,1854.586,1863.728,What kind of resources you are needing in order to be able to continue the partnerships.,30,,
251,0.97,1863.728,1866.731,And I had a third part of the question but forgot.,30,,
252,0.97,1866.731,1870.501,Let's start there.,30,,
253,0.97,1870.501,1872.737,I would be happy to speak to that.,31,,
254,0.97,1872.737,1883.514,"So our processes, Joaquin described as we fund these small organizations, the six you see listed here.",31,,
255,0.97,1883.514,1884.782,In order to maintain help lines.,31,,
256,0.97,1884.782,1902.367,"And we also fund some of the organizations in order to make sure they are able to, if not maintain a consistent Helpline to do outreach events and make available information in their languages, to the immigrant communities.",31,,
257,0.97,1902.367,1911.976,And to do that we give them fairly modest monthly Stipend of about $4000 per organization per month.,31,,
258,0.97,1911.976,1932.397,"That funding will end and so what we will be doing is reaching out to them to determine, are you able to continue providing the service if we are channeling as much information as we can from public health and other places, to make sure they are aware of what the city's resources are.",31,,
259,0.97,1932.397,1944.409,"Are they able to continue to fund whether a staff person to answer the phone, or to be sending out a translation material in-house, et cetera.",31,,
260,0.97,1944.409,1957.288,"And if they are able to do that, we will talk about how they might want us to partner with them to continue to publicize the availability of this information in social media.",31,,
261,0.97,1957.288,1968.333,"And you know, but, our ability to buy ads, and in ethnic media and otherwise publicize or fund them to do this, that ends.",31,,
262,0.97,1968.333,1982.88,"To do that we spent about $64,000 a month on directly, directly on the Community-Based organizations in order to be able to staff that and accompany it with a media strategy.",31,,
263,0.97,1982.88,1987.218,Even a modest one.,31,,
264,0.97,1987.218,1989.187,"You know, it would be about $300,000 for three months.",31,,
265,0.97,1989.187,2006.671,"We would love to be good partners, to be able to look at a longer-term of six months or so, so they can build in the capacity, maintain it, and know that the city is there with them, trying to reach the most vulnerable folks.",31,,
266,0.97,2006.671,2010.675,Does that cover?,31,,
267,0.97,2010.675,2018.583,"Yes, that is helpful additional information.",32,,
268,0.97,2018.583,2021.486,"Councilmember Nelson, did you have a question about the slide or a different topic?",32,,
269,0.97,2021.486,2022.62,I do.,33,,
270,0.97,2022.62,2026.157,"Well, it is, one part is a different topic.",33,,
271,0.97,2026.157,2032.296,Thank you.,33,,
272,0.97,2032.296,2037.135,"In the, do people still need an appointment to get a vaccination at the city run vaccination sites?",33,,
273,0.97,2037.135,2062.727,"Because, if so, one thing I noticed when I visited the Reindeer Beach vaccination site, last March, is that the communication that people get, it is one thing to have multi lingual information about this, but the appointment, to get the appointment, the Website is all in English.",33,,
274,0.97,2062.727,2067.231,And the Emails and the text messages that people get back are in English.,33,,
275,0.97,2067.231,2080.978,"I am wondering, I think that that could be, there needs to be Multilingual materials there, to help people get into the vaccination site, if it is needed.",33,,
276,0.97,2080.978,2083.614,That is what I wanted to know.,33,,
277,0.97,2083.614,2087.318,"S, thank you for the question.",34,,
278,0.97,2087.318,2090.888,As I understand both sides are taking Walk-Ins for folks with no appointment.,34,,
279,0.97,2090.888,2096.461,That the preference is for folks to make an appointment.,34,,
280,0.97,2096.461,2110.074,"I do know that folks have been able to, it is a longer wait but people have been able to roll up to either the Rainier beach or West Seattle vaccination clinics, currently in operation to get an appointment.",34,,
281,0.97,2110.074,2112.677,It may be a weight of 1 to 2 hours.,34,,
282,0.97,2112.677,2127.358,"Regarding the platform that we use for the, or Seattle fire Department uses for appointments, there was language access integrated into that and there have been some issues.",34,,
283,0.97,2127.358,2135.6,That is something that we have notified them about.,34,,
284,0.97,2135.6,2154.452,"We are able to at least let people know that if they are having trouble, people can call the customer service Bureau from Monday through Saturday, I believe 8:30, until 5:00 or 6:00, and talk to a customer service representative that can quickly bring an interpreter, Telephonic interpreter, and talk people through the process.",34,,
285,0.97,2154.452,2160.291,"Maybe even encourage them to walk up, if needed.",34,,
286,0.97,2160.291,2163.561,Or even walk them through the process to make the appointment for them on that end.,34,,
287,0.97,2163.561,2169.3,"So sometimes we are not able to do it through Online, we are able to complement with the phone.",34,,
288,0.97,2169.3,2181.112,"To be honest, a lot of immigrant and refugee imitated English folks prefer the phone and get overwhelmed by the Internet.",34,,
289,0.97,2181.112,2184.348,English is my first language and I am overwhelmed by the Internet sometimes.,34,,
290,0.97,2184.348,2188.119,Sometimes having a voice at the other end of the phone is helpful.,34,,
291,0.97,2188.119,2197.929,With respect to that I will also mention that all of our funded partners are trained and have been able to assist people in making appointments when they are ready to do so.,35,,
292,0.97,2197.929,2200.398,That is part of what we are funding them for.,35,,
293,0.97,2200.398,2209.206,To be able to attend Trainings and learn how to use the resources so they can be trusted navigators.,35,,
294,0.97,2209.206,2210.975,Thank you so much.,36,,
295,0.97,2210.975,2213.711,"Councilmember Nelson, do you have another question?",36,,
296,0.97,2213.711,2218.616,Did that answer your question?,36,,
297,0.97,2218.616,2218.816,Okay.,36,,
298,0.97,2218.816,2221.052,Your hand is still up.,36,,
299,0.97,2221.052,2224.121,I was about to take that up.,37,,
300,0.97,2224.121,2225.222,"Okay, fair enough.",38,,
301,0.97,2225.222,2226.19,Thanks.,38,,
302,0.97,2226.19,2229.827,"I want to stay on this, the language access issue.",38,,
303,0.97,2229.827,2240.271,So first of all I did not know about the interdepartmental work happening to bring all of the translation services In- house.,38,,
304,0.97,2240.271,2246.978,I am really happy to hear about that.,38,,
305,0.97,2246.978,2268.266,"And I think the issue that it RAISES or question it RAISES for me is, as somebody who has been involved with a lot of community meetings, you know, my previous work was doing a lot of community engagement work and the language access is always an issue.",38,,
306,0.97,2268.266,2281.679,Does this mean or can you talk a little bit about what it means to have every city Department now contemplating their community engagement language access needs?,38,,
307,0.97,2281.679,2290.488,"And will that, does that mean there will be a line item in each Department's budget, for when they are doing community outreach strategies for their work?",38,,
308,0.97,2290.488,2298.429,"Can you talk a little bit about what it means across the city in our departments, in terms of this component of really authentic community engagement.",38,,
309,0.97,2298.429,2304.135,Absolutely.,39,,
310,0.97,2304.135,2306.737,As you know every Department in the city is vastly different.,39,,
311,0.97,2306.737,2322.887,"We have flexibility for our departments and a culture they can Department determine each of their program budgets, that they can use language access to centralized within their division, and so forth.",39,,
312,0.97,2322.887,2328.826,Citywide B funding is not entirely centralized.,39,,
313,0.97,2328.826,2345.309,"The program is small, it is just two FTE and those folks are able to go out, or will be when we fill the second position, to provide technical assistance from early stages for each Department.",39,,
314,0.97,2345.309,2355.219,"Being able to think about how they are gathering the data, what the need is, how they are creating the materials in a way that is translation ready and so forth.",39,,
315,0.97,2355.219,2361.125,So that small piece of budget is centralized.,39,,
316,0.97,2361.125,2365.463,Otherwise the departments will have some discretion to decide how they are doing it with that support.,39,,
317,0.97,2365.463,2374.839,"Once they get to the stage where they need to contact Interpreters or Translators, that can be done through the central assignment system.",39,,

319,0.97,2379.41,2393.391,"That is not quite true unless we think of the whole Seattle community in-house, we are working with in the community.",39,,
320,0.97,2393.391,2421.218,"Still coming on board for a couple years ago for city employees making sure that we are compensating employees who are bilingual and able to use language skills on the job and we are using those to make sure that our response to community and offerings are more accessible . in terms of our professional translation and ability to really communicate Outwards in language, we really do rely on community members for that and compensate them.",39,,

373,0.97,2676.306,2684.281,"And we help them build closer ties, develop a stronger sense of place and engage with their community and each other, and city government.",56,,
374,0.97,2684.281,2691.455,We do this by centering two North Star goals.,56,,
375,0.97,2691.455,2698.295,"The goal 1, to put raisin equity at the center of all decisions and actions and to invest in the power of community to forge their own solutions.",56,,
376,0.97,2698.295,2705.369,"We do that any number of ways, including grants that we will talk about later.",56,,
377,0.97,2705.369,2708.439,We organize our work around four core strategies.,56,,
378,0.97,2708.439,2713.544,The trusted advocate model is one that came from community.,56,,
379,0.97,2713.544,2731.328,"Council members, you are familiar with some work that came out of South Seattle, South King County, Rainier Beach, but the trusted advocate model is focused on where we intentionally center our community in our work, through our community liaison program.",56,,
380,0.97,2731.328,2737.434,Which is meant to build authentic relationships that are rooted in mutual trust and respect.,56,,
381,0.97,2737.434,2741.538,We are currently in the contracting process with our 2022 community liaisons.,56,,
382,0.97,2741.538,2748.045,"But in 2021 we had 45 different community like liaisons, representing 27 anguish in communities.",56,,
383,0.97,2748.045,2753.016,"You heard from our partner, Oira.",56,,
384,0.97,2753.016,2759.757,Our liaisons were closely with Oira and the dissemination of vaccine information.,56,,
385,0.97,2759.757,2762.926,As well as other initiatives.,56,,
386,0.97,2762.926,2774.304,"Our people centered Storytelling is where we invest in community stories, and provide a platform for community voices to help shave shape the civic conversation.",56,,
387,0.97,2774.304,2782.379,I encourage you to take a look at some stories we are consistent consistently publishing.,56,,
388,0.97,2782.379,2794.491,One went out this week where highlighting experiences folks had during the pandemic and elevating some of the important storylines for the communities.,56,,
389,0.97,2794.491,2801.098,"We invest in programs around civic education, including our pace program, some of you have participated with.",56,,
390,0.97,2801.098,2809.072,"In 2020 and 2019, we led the city's census work, in partnership with Oira as well.",56,,
391,0.97,2809.072,2824.788,"And we shared resource knowledge and tools to increase civic participation, cultivate activists and leaders, and part of the civic education and priority will be the Council redistricting process that we will talk about Ater.",56,,
392,0.97,2824.788,2832.062,"Finally, our fourth core strategy is investing around equitable engagement and investments.",56,,
393,0.97,2832.062,2834.231,It is a core piece of what we do.,56,,
394,0.97,2834.231,2840.671,Our focus is to engage with communities most impacted by city policies and projects.,56,,
395,0.97,2840.671,2843.173,Center their ideas in the development and implementation of city investments.,56,,
396,0.97,2843.173,2845.976,This is back to investing into the power of communities.,56,,
397,0.97,2845.976,2849.947,Our grants is what is centered in this work.,56,,
398,0.97,2849.947,2856.887,"We have our food equity Fund, neighborhood matching fund, that has been around since the late 80s.",56,,
399,0.97,2856.887,2867.331,"In fact today is the release date for the next round of around $860,000, in the neighborhood matching fund grants.",56,,
400,0.97,2867.331,2871.668,That will open today and close on March 28th.,56,,

403,0.97,2888.619,2895.726,The indigenous Council will open and close at 5:00 P.M ..,56,,
404,0.97,2895.726,2898.028,For those interested.,56,,
405,0.97,2898.028,2901.498,"So in 2022, we will highlight here a few priorities.",56,,
406,0.97,2901.498,2903.734,This is not everything we are doing.,56,,
407,0.97,2903.734,2908.005,But just some of the work that we are doing that I would like to highlight.,56,,
408,0.97,2908.005,2918.548,"With a caveat that we are still in the transition with a new Mayor, identifying additional priorities.",56,,
409,0.97,2918.548,2937.2,So in 2022 our work is to Co- lead the racial equity and engagement work as part of the West Seattle Ballard link extension or the Wsble.,56,,
410,0.97,2937.2,2940.671,"Building relationship with community, providing the capacity and partnership necessary for community to be powerful self advocates.",56,,
411,0.97,2940.671,2955.585,"Although we are active from West Seattle to Ballard, we have a specific area in the Chinatown International district, given the history of the project happening in the community.",56,,
412,0.97,2955.585,2966.63,"As well as Delbert, where we are looking through the racial equity Toolkit, at specific interventions and specific policy shifts that should be part of the sound transit work there.",56,,
413,0.97,2966.63,2980.711,"We will hear a little about our generational wealth program, this is an exciting piece of work for 2022 that was funded through the equitable communities initiative last year.",56,,
414,0.97,2980.711,2990.153,We want to lead an interdepartmental team to build a baseline for infrastructure or city departments to collaborate and invest in community centered approaches.,56,,
415,0.97,2990.153,3007.938,"Councilmember Morales, we are aware of your legislative intent around community wealth and we will work through this Idt, as well as the guaranteed pilot that was passed last year.",56,,
416,0.97,3007.938,3022.386,As I mentioned we have community grants in 2022 and we continue to strengthen the recently launched food equity program that invests in community work where the communities have been most impacted by food and health inequities.,56,,
417,0.97,3022.386,3026.456,This is particularly important as a result of the current pandemic.,56,,
418,0.97,3026.456,3034.431,"Which has exasperated food in equities and food deserts, and we are looking at funding food justice programs as part of this.",56,,
419,0.97,3034.431,3041.538,"We have heard a little, well you have heard in the public comment, it is a priority for us, the work around the comprehensive plan.",56,,
420,0.97,3041.538,3049.846,We have two ways we are working with our colleagues at the office of planning and community development.,56,,
421,0.97,3049.846,3062.592,"One is through the liaison program, they will partner with several community liaisons, to expand and extend the community efforts.",56,,
422,0.97,3062.592,3063.894,Over the next couple of years.,56,,
423,0.97,3063.894,3073.103,"And specifically through our work with the historic preservation program, that is going to use the opportunity to update the historic resource survey that has not been fully updated since 2008, 2009.",56,,
424,0.97,3073.103,3077.874,And finally the redistricting.,56,,

508,0.97,3683.98,3690.62,I have a couple questions and I Councilmember Strauss has a question.,66,,
509,0.97,3690.62,3704.5,"First of all, I want to congratulate you on finding an Acronym for the West Seattle Ballard link, I had not heard Wsble before and was struggling to find an Acronym for the name of my committee.",66,,
510,0.97,3704.5,3705.301,I am coming up short.,66,,
511,0.97,3705.301,3717.48,"Anyway, I have a question about the work happening in the Cid.",66,,
512,0.97,3717.647,3723.186,"I know we are going to have a lot of work to do, particularly around community engagement, translating information about the sound transit project.",66,,
513,0.97,3723.186,3730.426,"Cn you talk a little bit about, how shall I say this?",66,,
514,0.97,3730.426,3745.374,How sound transit is contributing to work that needs to happen with engaging community and the city partners with them in translation services and getting materials out so people really understand what is happening with the project.,66,,
515,0.97,3745.374,3747.643,Thank you Councilmember.,67,,
516,0.97,3747.643,3764.66,"I also want to recognize that Jessica grant from the Department of neighborhoods, who oversees the work and is our sound transit lead is on as well.",67,,
517,0.97,3764.66,3766.529,"I will say Councilmember, that is a good question.",67,,
518,0.97,3766.529,3775.037,"We worked very closely, not just with the internal city partners, but with sound transit as part of the racial equity work, as part of our community engagement planning.",67,,
519,0.97,3775.037,3786.749,"And Jessica, if you want to add to that in terms of what the next steps look like, as we continue to implement now the community engagement plans.",67,,
520,0.97,3786.749,3795.558,"Yes, we are excited in 2022 to build on a partnership that we started in 2021 with our liaison program and sound transit.",68,,
521,0.97,3795.558,3806.135,"So we've contracted with 11 community liaisons to be focused in on the Chinatown International district, as well as Belridge.",68,,
522,0.97,3806.135,3824.754,"We started last year with intensive training and support and they were able to go out into the community with sound transit doing door-to-door outreach for businesses, attending community meetings, being at fairs and festivals.",68,,
523,0.97,3824.754,3829.492,"This year, just last night, they were trained up on the important draft environmental impact statement that was just released.",68,,
524,0.97,3829.492,3834.53,So they will be very much helping to spread the word.,68,,
525,0.97,3834.53,3841.938,Sound transit has continued to do some translation work.,68,,
526,0.97,3841.938,3849.078,"But we were able to, through the liaisons, transition from translation to Trans creation.",68,,
527,0.97,3849.078,3855.885,Allowing folks now who understand the content to also explain it in language.,68,,
528,0.97,3855.885,3865.962,So our partnership is one that continues to expand what both agencies are capable of and what both agencies are capable of together.,68,,
529,0.97,3865.962,3870.032,I am excited to see how we move forward.,68,,
530,0.97,3870.032,3872.134,But I think a lot of that is new partnership.,68,,
531,0.97,3872.134,3873.102,Good to know.,69,,
532,0.97,3873.102,3875.037,I know that that is a big challenge.,69,,
533,0.97,3875.037,3882.144,"That material is dense, and I can barely understand it in English.",69,,
534,0.97,3882.144,3884.013,So Kudos to everyone working on that.,69,,
535,0.97,3884.013,3893.99,"I want to go to the generational wealth, we don't have to go to the slide but I have a couple questions.",69,,
536,0.97,3893.99,3900.096,So I really am excited about this work.,69,,
537,0.97,3900.096,3907.236,I am eager to see how we can start to move in this direction of really closing the racial wealth gap and what the city can do.,69,,
538,0.97,3907.236,3924.687,"I know it will be across departments, but I wonder if you can maybe talk a little bit more about the outcomes that you see to demonstrate how we are closing those gaps.",69,,
539,0.97,3924.687,3926.956,Or if we are just not there yet.,69,,
540,0.97,3926.956,3933.796,"But, I am always thinking about like one of the outcomes we are shooting for and how we get there.",69,,
541,0.97,3933.796,3946.609,"I know that this is new and stuff that we are just starting to pull together but I would love to hear a little bit, if you have it, about what are the outcomes that we are looking for, the strategies for getting them.",69,,
542,0.97,3946.609,3948.477,We are early in the process.,70,,
543,0.97,3948.477,3949.812,Some of this will change.,70,,
544,0.97,3949.812,3955.985,But Jackie do you want to take that one?,70,,
545,0.97,3955.985,3959.822,"Sure, I can highlight what outcome this year.",71,,
546,0.97,3959.822,3976.405,"As I mentioned we will be launching pilots this year and one of those is, again, directed by--, financial literacy and investing in programs that are sharing knowledge around how to secure wealth in communities.",71,,
547,0.97,3976.405,3994.857,"So we will be Partnering with local Nonprofits and perhaps even a legal firm, to provide estate and succession planning, financial literacy courses, and pro Bono legal services.",71,,
548,0.97,3994.857,4006.736,"We are hoping that at least this year, you know, given that we have limited funding, really Prioritizing how we are not just growing assets but securing assets that communities of color have already built.",71,,
549,0.97,4006.736,4011.107,Especially when we think about who participates in estate planning and succession planning.,71,,
550,0.97,4011.107,4018.147,The numbers there do not point towards communities of color being active participants in those legal systems.,71,,
551,0.97,4018.147,4026.689,So how can we expand and secure assets that communities have already done this year.,71,,
552,0.97,4026.689,4030.826,Being able to talk about the impact of that pilot this year.,71,,
553,0.97,4030.826,4038.701,Another thing that we direct it was to launch a portal love City resources.,71,,
554,0.97,4038.701,4054.45,"We are hoping through the development and working with other departments on creating an internal inventory of our programs and evaluation of our program, to really understand which ones have been most effective in reaching our goals of closing Race-Based wealth gaps.",71,,
555,0.97,4054.45,4056.752,I think that will be a deliverable this year.,71,,
556,0.97,4056.752,4063.059,That will set us as a city on course to make Impactful investments in the future.,71,,
557,0.97,4063.059,4072.234,"That inventory plus the external portal, that will sort of be a Hub of resources that community can access.",71,,
558,0.97,4072.234,4083.179,"And really understand all of the different ways that they can build wealth at different stages of their life or as business owners verses, you know, employees or however it might be.",71,,
559,0.97,4083.179,4092.388,But having that resource available in a unified place I think will be another strong deliverable that we will have hopefully by the end of this year.,71,,
560,0.97,4092.388,4095.758,"Great, thank you so much Jackie.",72,,
561,0.97,4095.758,4098.327,"Councilmember Strauss, you had a question?",72,,
562,0.97,4098.327,4104.4,Thank you chair Morales.,73,,
563,0.97,4104.4,4115.611,Not so much of a question but I want to thank the director . I am sad to say that you are no longer in my committee.,73,,
564,0.97,4115.611,4120.349,"It does make the Acronym easier, going from one to Land- use.",73,,
565,0.97,4120.349,4126.355,There is still more work that I would love to work with you on in the historic districts.,73,,
566,0.97,4126.355,4136.265,I just wanted to take a moment to recognize the Department of neighborhoods does so much.,73,,
567,0.97,4136.265,4144.24,"From key patches, language interaction, Storytelling, managing the historic districts in our city, D.O.N.",73,,
568,0.97,4144.24,4146.275,"Does so much, thank you to you and your team.",73,,
569,0.97,4146.275,4149.745,I know the people doing the work are the ones making all of the changes have been.,73,,
570,0.97,4149.745,4151.08,"So, thank you director.",73,,
571,0.97,4151.08,4153.215,Thank you Councilmember.,74,,
572,0.97,4153.215,4153.682,Likewise.,74,,
573,0.97,4153.682,4160.99,And hopefully just because you are not in my committee we will still be able to work together.,75,,
574,0.97,4160.99,4164.226,Councilmember Nelson.,76,,
575,0.97,4164.226,4167.997,"Yes, thank you very much for the presentation.",77,,
576,0.97,4167.997,4175.371,I asked for the org chart in the external relations section of your organization.,77,,
577,0.97,4175.371,4180.309,"I was wondering, and did generational wealth",77,,
578,0.97,4231.727,4238.334,-- as well as others in the community that we have relationships with.,78,,
579,0.97,4238.334,4248.577,We are always looking to expand those connections in a relationship and the team works hard in doing that.,78,,
580,0.97,4248.577,4263.726,"I will say, in terms of generational wealth building work, a strong partner of ours, and really guiding this work, seeing how we are Leveraging investments and relationships we already have in different neighborhoods.",79,,
581,0.97,4263.726,4268.23,So that integration is definitely a part of how we are building this program.,79,,
582,0.97,4268.23,4272.968,Thank you.,80,,
583,0.97,4272.968,4276.271,"Okay, any other questions from colleagues?",81,,

610,0.97,4395.324,4409.905,"Yes, so, at Deel we have an amazing diverse group of individuals who are committed to transforming the lives of our Seattle children, youth, and families.",88,,
611,0.97,4409.905,4413.142,As you see here we are rapidly growing Department.,88,,
612,0.97,4413.142,4423.585,"We started off with like 38 staff, now as you can see we are at 120 fantastic folks.",88,,
613,0.97,4423.585,4428.49,"And as you can also see on here, our annual investment, it sees over 100 million per year.",88,,
614,0.97,4428.49,4430.759,"So, super excited about that.",88,,
615,0.97,4430.759,4432.961,And you can go to the next slide.,88,,
616,0.97,4432.961,4436.098,Thank you.,88,,
617,0.97,4436.098,4438.2,"And as you can tell, from my voice, my excitement.",88,,
618,0.97,4438.2,4451.246,I am also really proud to share with you Deel's to being an Antiracist organization.,88,,
619,0.97,4451.246,4458.387,"We stand in solidarity with our children, students, and families, community's, against acts of racism.",88,,
620,0.97,4458.387,4462.291,"Not only do we stand with them, we also modeled this expectation and behavior through our investments.",88,,
621,0.97,4462.291,4465.994,Which are too close Race-Based opportunity gaps.,88,,
622,0.97,4465.994,4471.099,"And just again, excited to share that with you.",88,,
623,0.97,4471.099,4476.171,"What you see here, these are in Deel, we have four results.",88,,
624,0.97,4476.171,4484.947,The first is all Seattle families will have access to affordable quality Childcare.,88,,
625,0.97,4484.947,4491.153,"The second is, we will make sure that all of our children are kindergarten ready.",88,,
626,0.97,4491.153,4501.129,"Our third result is that all of our Seattle students graduate from school, college and career ready.",88,,
627,0.97,4501.129,4517.679,"And I am sure as you all have been following and no, our last result is that we really want to make sure all of our Seattle students attain a Postsecondary degree, credential, or some type of certificate.",88,,
628,0.97,4517.679,4525.821,"Again, I am super confident that everyone will support these goals and we are excited about this.",88,,
629,0.97,4525.821,4527.723,So now what you see are our three core strategies.,88,,
630,0.97,4527.723,4540.602,"This is just how Deel, this is our guide for how we invest in support our Seattle children, youth, and families.",88,,
631,0.97,4540.602,4544.306,So we have equitable educational opportunities.,88,,
632,0.97,4544.306,4552.714,And an example of that is our tuition subsidies from both our preschool and Seattle promise.,88,,
633,0.97,4552.714,4560.489,"We have our student and family supports, an example of that one is just we are invested in School-Based health centers.",88,,
634,0.97,4560.489,4578.24,"And then our third strategy is, I should say for the high quality environments, this is where we really invest in culturally specific and responsive programming such as the Kingmakers of Seattle.",88,,
635,0.97,4578.24,4581.51,A program administered by Seattle public schools.,88,,
636,0.97,4581.51,4586.214,"So again, super excited about that.",88,,
637,0.97,4586.214,4595.023,"And now, so, with this, our budget, so we have two service divisions in Deel.",88,,
638,0.97,4595.023,4602.13,"Early learning service division, and we have K-12, Postsecondary service division.",88,,
639,0.97,4602.13,4610.973,"And in 2022 our adopted budget is $121 million, with majority of the spending coming in early learning.",88,,
640,0.97,4610.973,4613.375,As you can see.,88,,
641,0.97,4613.375,4619.314,And contributing to our results of our Childcare and access to kindergarten readiness.,88,,
642,0.97,4619.314,4629.558,"But we also invest in K-12, and Postsecondary, comprising of 40% of the Department's spending.",88,,
643,0.97,4629.558,4648.61,"Okay, so as you can see here, Beth family and education preschool levy, it is the largest source of the Deel revenue, around 78%.",88,,
644,0.97,4648.61,4650.912,"And so, thank you for going to the next slide.",88,,
645,0.97,4650.912,4659.087,"So now, for our investments, we convene a levy oversight committee.",88,,
646,0.97,4659.087,4669.831,"The committee, what they do is overview, advise, make recommendations and advocate in support of our levy, investments and priorities.",88,,
647,0.97,4669.831,4676.838,We have 17 members of this levy oversight committee.,88,,
648,0.97,4676.838,4682.944,Councilmember Morales represents us from the Council and you were there last night.,88,,
649,0.97,4682.944,4686.381,As I mentioned a moment ago we have one of our appointed members with us today.,88,,
650,0.97,4686.381,4702.564,"What I will do is just pause, I would like to invite Erin Okuno to share some words on your experiment--experience on me promise levy oversight committee.",88,,
651,0.97,4702.564,4706.568,"I am Erin Okuno, I am the--.",89,,
652,0.97,4706.568,4712.541,We are an organization focused on the southeast Seattle region.,89,,
653,0.97,4712.541,4728.09,"We work really deeply with communities and families of color to find out what they are interested in, what they want to see first, their children of color, around education.",89,,
654,0.97,4728.09,4742.104,We work intensely with a lot of the small Community-Based organizations and a lot of the Cbos are connected to the communities of color.,89,,
655,0.97,4742.104,4744.406,"It is a lot of fun, we have great conversations.",89,,
656,0.97,4744.406,4753.782,"I am proud of the relationships we have built across the community and with different organizations, institutions, city government, to make this happen.",89,,
657,0.97,4753.782,4761.49,I am also really proud to say that I have been fortunate to work on the Seattle preschool program.,89,,
658,0.97,4761.49,4765.026,"I was a Co-Chair when it first started now many, many years ago.",89,,
659,0.97,4765.026,4777.272,"And my youngest child was in the class and is now a thriving Fourth-Grader, who is very secure in herself and likes to tell me exactly what she thinks.",89,,
660,0.97,4777.272,4783.011,I credit Spp forgiving her that strong ground of thinking.,89,,
661,0.97,4783.011,4795.257,"My older child is also a benefit of the levy investments across many of the schools in our neighborhoods, including the schools that my children attend.",89,,
662,0.97,4795.257,4797.826,"So, thank you for all of your work.",89,,
663,0.97,4797.826,4803.165,"Thank you, thank you Erin, appreciate you being here with us.",90,,
664,0.97,4803.165,4807.435,Glad to hear those stories.,90,,
665,0.97,4807.435,4811.706,What I will do now is I am going to turn this over to Marissa Rousselle.,90,,
666,0.97,4811.706,4821.483,Marissa is going to show the Deel priorities with Council this year.,90,,
667,0.97,4821.483,4825.787,Thank you Dwane.,91,,
668,0.97,4825.787,4826.254,Hello everyone.,91,,
669,0.97,4826.254,4831.927,What you will see on the slide here is some recent past engagement that Deel has had with Council.,91,,
670,0.97,4831.927,4834.696,We know there are some changing memberships on the education committee.,91,,
671,0.97,4834.696,4864.993,"So I just wanted to highlight for you the deep and extensive work we did with Council in 2018 and 2019, two develop the levy that Council past, and ordered it in 2018, specifying the Council intent to the levy and implementation and evaluation plan all 140 something pages of it, adopted by ordinances as well in 2019.",91,,
672,0.97,4864.993,4875.403,In 2020 there were a number of Council statements of legislative intent that Deel did work on and submit back.,91,,
673,0.97,4875.403,4895.323,"We do share with you information about our data desegregation practices, we submitted extensive reports, completed by external consultants, related to increasing access and supporting the infant Highflown toddler sector.",91,,
674,0.97,4895.323,4910.805,"Also recommendations regarding the city's participation in Washington state program, that we are excited to share was started this current year with support from Federal Coronavirus response funding.",91,,
675,0.97,4910.805,4923.852,We also had three temporary amendments to the implementation plan in response to Covid.,91,,
676,0.97,4923.852,4938.733,"And in 2021, as I mentioned, the Seattle rescue plan investments not only, did those support the Seattle promise program but also included resources for the Childcare sector door.",91,,
677,0.97,4938.733,4943.538,"So we are aligned on those properties with Council and excited to continue the work in support of Childcare, for sure.",91,,
678,0.97,4943.538,4950.779,This year Deel's priorities are to continue to sustain a response to Covid.,91,,
679,0.97,4950.779,4957.986,"And to support children, youth, and families as best as we can.",91,,
680,0.97,4957.986,4964.092,We know that there are policy changes on the horizon related to Childcare at multiple levels.,91,,
681,0.97,4964.092,4966.928,Soaking County will be starting their Childcare subsidy program.,91,,
682,0.97,4966.928,4972.834,Again that is the kids levy.,91,,
683,0.97,4972.834,4985.146,"And also Childcare subsidy programs and businesses may come from the state, Childcare indicating as a priority at the Federal level as well.",91,,
684,0.97,4985.146,4991.219,"We are aligned and can maximize the use of local resources, it is important to Deel.",91,,
685,0.97,4991.219,4995.757,"And as Dwane shared, our Department has grown really quickly.",91,,
686,0.97,4995.757,5005.0,"In 2018, of course we took our Spp levy and our families and education levy, and they became one giant levy.",91,,
687,0.97,5005.0,5022.484,And we are really proud of that and the work this year is to build a stronger connection across all areas and investments so that there is a true preschool to Postsecondary Pathway for Seattle's youth.,91,,
688,0.97,5022.484,5032.694,Is a specific racial equity goal we will be focusing on different support for black and Brown scholars with an emphasis on math instruction.,91,,
689,0.97,5032.694,5045.573,"And as we shared with Council last year, through the Seattle promise Toolkit that was shared with Council, there are some disparities and promised scholar outcomes and we will focus on that this year as well.",91,,
690,0.97,5045.573,5057.652,The investments from the Seattle rescue plan are intended to address the success of that program.,91,,
691,0.97,5057.652,5067.495,"And the priority, systems and structures for the Grantmaking when due, as well as staff development.",91,,
692,0.97,5067.495,5074.436,And career opportunities internal to the Department.,91,,
693,0.97,5074.436,5080.942,And then my last slide for you today is just a signal of what is to come.,91,,
694,0.97,5080.942,5084.212,So our levy oversight committee will meet monthly.,91,,
695,0.97,5084.212,5106.501,"They have an annual retreat, and they will be advising this spring on a proposed use for Deel undesignated--from the levy.",91,,
696,0.97,5106.501,5114.175,Council required the $4 million from the undesignated unbalanced purpose to sustain investments in the Seattle promise program.,91,,
697,0.97,5114.175,5122.283,The second bullet point speaks to legislation that we hope to transmit to Council in late Buri.,91,,
698,0.97,5122.283,5142.27,We began work on the legislation with former Council Gonzalez's--but able not able to bring it to committee so that will be a priority.,91,,
699,0.97,5142.27,5146.207,There is a one year lag on the report because we do not receive academic data from the state.,91,,
700,0.97,5146.207,5147.208,Until the following fall.,91,,
701,0.97,5147.208,5152.28,So this will be for the second year of the Fepp levy.,91,,
702,0.97,5152.28,5166.161,"And we know that Childcare is a priority of many members on the committee so we anticipate to bring you more information on changes we will make to be in alignment with the county, state, and Federal investments.",91,,
703,0.97,5166.161,5169.831,"And, Dwane, back to you.",91,,
704,0.97,5169.831,5171.666,"Yes, thank you Marissa.",92,,
705,0.97,5171.666,5183.511,"So I will not read everything on this slide, but we just really want Council to know that we are in like consistent and regular Munication with our partners.",92,,
706,0.97,5183.511,5197.392,We know everyone is doing their best to continue the important work of caring for our young scholars and kids and educating our youth during the pandemic.,92,,
707,0.97,5197.392,5204.599,At Deel we have done quite a few things to help support the service providers and mitigate the spread of Covid.,92,,
708,0.97,5204.599,5218.279,"I just also want to highlight the support of the investment for child care providers and workers, as well as the equity Enhancement, Seattle promise program.",92,,
709,0.97,5218.279,5230.858,"Because of the Enhancement it enabled us to establish a Pathway for Reentry for promise scholars, whose college experience was really disrupted Ecause of Covid.",92,,
710,0.97,5230.858,5243.705,"And those funds actually also enabled us to increase or expand the equity scholarship component of the Seattle promise from 500 a quarter, to 1000 a quarter.",92,,
711,0.97,5243.705,5248.81,And also including just an additional reach for more of the lower income scholars.,92,,
712,0.97,5248.81,5267.428,"In our communication team at Deel is also part of the work from Oira and D.O.N., from earlier today as I was listening to the presentation.",92,,
713,0.97,5267.428,5277.605,"It is about Messaging and graphic design work, really to promote vaccine access, and acceptance among our Bipoc communities.",92,,
714,0.97,5277.605,5280.341,Thank you.,92,,
715,0.97,5280.341,5288.483,"So, Lastly, what I have here, just some reminders.",92,,
716,0.97,5288.483,5304.799,We would like Council to support in recruiting our new members for our oversight committee and we know there are many brilliant young leaders and scholars whose voice would actually add value to our work.,92,,
717,0.97,5304.799,5319.947,"We listened to one last night, so if you are listening to this and you are a high school senior or you know a high school senior at a Seattle public school, please encourage them to apply to the Seattle promise program.",92,,
718,0.97,5319.947,5327.488,So they can explore the rich array of Coursework offered by the the colleges.,92,,
719,0.97,5327.488,5329.59,They can consider that the next step after high school.,92,,
720,0.97,5329.59,5344.138,"I think we all would agree that our Seattle college partners have some amazing programs, including the fire science degree program that launched in North Seattle, justice Paulette North Seattle college.",92,,
721,0.97,5344.138,5360.555,Should I say be fire Department has really been amazing throughout the pandemic and I just hope that the youth will consider a career as a firefighter as a way to achieve whatever their aspirations or goals are.,92,,
722,0.97,5360.555,5363.157,And that concludes our presentation.,92,,
723,0.97,5363.157,5368.062,I just want to thank you for the opportunity again.,92,,
724,0.97,5368.062,5370.898,Looking forward to your partnership as we continue the journey.,92,,
725,0.97,5370.898,5374.902,To transform the lives of our Seattle children and youth.,92,,
726,0.97,5374.902,5378.339,Thank you so much everybody.,93,,
727,0.97,5378.339,5380.208,"Erin, thank you for joining.",93,,
728,0.97,5380.208,5383.01,It is really good to hear from you.,93,,
729,0.97,5383.01,5393.254,"Particularly as a member, not just as the oversight committee but a community member from the district to I know has been doing important work in this space for a long time.",93,,
730,0.97,5393.254,5398.559,I have a few questions that I will start off with.,93,,
731,0.97,5398.559,5408.202,"I would love to hear a little bit more about the partnership that you have with the school district, particularly as it relates to mental health supports.",93,,
732,0.97,5408.202,5415.343,"You know, our kids were at home for almost two years.",93,,
733,0.97,5415.343,5422.917,I know there is a lot of stress and trauma our students are experiencing because of the isolation and alienation they experience.,93,,
734,0.97,5422.917,5429.223,And I know that we don't have nearly enough mental health supports right now.,93,,
735,0.97,5429.223,5431.058,Can you talk about what we are able to do?,93,,
736,0.97,5431.058,5437.398,And how the relationship with the school district works?,93,,
737,0.97,5437.398,5441.502,"Yes, I will speak a little bit to that and Marissa if I leave anything out, just add.",94,,
738,0.97,5441.502,5449.043,"We have an amazing heart ship with Seattle public schools, we meet frequently.",94,,
739,0.97,5449.043,5458.686,With them being the largest recipient of most of our funding dollars there are several constant entry points where we connect with them in regards to the mental health supports that is being provided.,94,,
740,0.97,5458.686,5470.531,"So you know we provide, there is a School-Based health clinic in all of our 17 comprehensive high schools in Seattle public schools.",94,,
741,0.97,5470.531,5476.504,"There is a component within the school base, a clinic that provides mental health support.",94,,
742,0.97,5476.504,5489.283,"So within the mental health supports, the students have access to the clinics and to the staff that are there just to help them throughout the pandemic.",94,,
743,0.97,5489.283,5496.023,"And I will pause right there, to see if Marissa wanted to add anything else to that.",94,,
744,0.97,5496.023,5500.595,This is also in conjunction with our partnership with public health King County right there.,94,,
745,0.97,5500.595,5509.971,"There is a nice translation between Deel, Seattle public schools, and our good partners at the King County public health.",94,,
746,0.97,5509.971,5512.173,Thanks Dwane.,95,,
747,0.97,5512.173,5521.749,"The only thing I would add is that we know that this is an urgent issue and concern for young people being discussed at the Federal level, state level.",95,,
748,0.97,5521.749,5530.558,"While our School-Based health centers provide medical services in the space, we acknowledge it is insufficient for the challenges our youth are facing right now.",95,,
749,0.97,5530.558,5539.367,And I would like to encourage us to think more broadly about what the mental health supports could look like.,95,,
750,0.97,5539.367,5559.954,"Deel has investments with a lot of Community-Based organizations, while their staff are not licensed or clinically trained, those relationships that young people can develop with other youth workers, adults, teachers, peers, they can support each other.",95,,
751,0.97,5559.954,5565.359,And so we know this is a priority for the levy oversight committee.,95,,
752,0.97,5565.359,5570.564,It is something we will talk about more with them.,95,,
753,0.97,5570.564,5581.008,And also focusing on the need for clinical services to support mental health but more broadly also about what community care and other interventions to help our young people could look like.,95,,
754,0.97,5581.008,5583.844,Thank you for that.,96,,
755,0.97,5583.844,5590.985,"So, 17 high schools, do we have that kind of support at any elementary or middle schools?",96,,
756,0.97,5590.985,5596.624,"They do, there is support in elementary and middle schools, we actually just expanded.",97,,
757,0.97,5596.624,5605.7,There is a total of 29 School- based health clinics throughout Seattle public schools.,97,,
758,0.97,5605.7,5611.772,"And we have them in the high schools, middle schools, and elementary as well.",97,,
759,0.97,5611.772,5614.241,Thank you.,98,,
760,0.97,5614.241,5618.779,"So, I have two more questions.",98,,
761,0.97,5618.779,5625.92,You mentioned legislation about the potential amendments to the Fepp plan.,98,,
762,0.97,5625.92,5628.155,Do we have a Timeline for when we might expect that?,98,,
763,0.97,5628.155,5634.261,"Yes, the goal is transmittal by the end of February.",99,,
764,0.97,5634.261,5638.299,"And as your team goes, some of our staff are facing Childcare disruptions to work.",99,,
765,0.97,5638.299,5646.107,So the Deel staff are working diligently on it and we will try to get it in February.,99,,
766,0.97,5646.107,5647.108,That is good to know.,100,,
767,0.97,5647.108,5650.378,We are just trying to get our own calendar set.,100,,
768,0.97,5650.378,5653.648,So just trying to anticipate what is going on.,100,,
769,0.97,5653.648,5655.816,So we talked about this a little before.,100,,
770,0.97,5655.816,5674.335,"But with relation to the Childcare investment strategy, you know, I am really interested in understanding how we support parents and how we sort of grow the pie of availability of Childcare.",100,,
771,0.97,5674.335,5692.453,"I am interested in you know, the subsidized care that is available, subsidy rates, the actual cost of providing for home versus center based, versus informal care.",100,,
772,0.97,5692.453,5704.331,"And I know that we talked a little about this, but can you help us differentiate between that kind of care and the actual work with the preschool programs that Deel is involved with?",100,,
773,0.97,5704.331,5712.74,"Yes, I will start off and then Marissa, if you would like to Chime in you can.",101,,
774,0.97,5712.74,5720.548,"I will start out by saying that I would definitely be more than willing to bring our early learning director Monica, and have a deeper dive around that.",101,,
775,0.97,5720.548,5733.594,"So we can kind of go through from the programming, whether it is Ccap, Spp, our family Childcare network, and providing a little bit more of a budget analysis.",101,,
776,0.97,5733.594,5738.532,I will be more than happy to schedule for something to do a deeper dive on that.,101,,
777,0.97,5738.532,5743.003,Weather at this committee or individually with you.,101,,
778,0.97,5743.003,5747.508,"And Marissa, did you want to speak to any other pieces of what she mentioned as well?",101,,
779,0.97,5747.508,5762.857,"You know, there is a lot of different entry points to impact the goal of expanded Childcare access . So the core work through our access program is about providing subsidies, the Affordability piece through the program.",102,,
780,0.97,5762.857,5773.768,"Some changes that we have done in the Ccap program in recent years are, we have expanded which providers can participate.",102,,
781,0.97,5773.768,5782.409,We are now recruiting providers just outside of Sydney city limits to support Seattleites.,102,,
782,0.97,5782.409,5787.481,We have increased eligibility for subsidy rates in alignment with the state income thresholds.,102,,
783,0.97,5787.481,5802.796,"And one of the benefits to providing is we instituted recently during Covid, we are compensating providers based on child enrollment.",102,,
784,0.97,5802.796,5803.43,In the subsidy program.,102,,
785,0.97,5803.43,5804.265,Not based on attendance.,102,,
786,0.97,5804.265,5812.173,"So if I as a parent choose to keep my child home from Daycare related to Covid, that will not negatively impact a Ccap provider.",102,,
787,0.97,5812.173,5824.652,That is specific to Ccap and around over 200 licensed Childcare providers in Seattle that participate in the program.,102,,
788,0.97,5824.652,5831.792,"And as I mentioned with the Seattle rescue plan funds, those dollars were available to all licensed Childcare providers in the city of Seattle.",102,,
789,0.97,5831.792,5843.037,"So we are in a space where Deel is considering work to those participating in the program, as well as providers in the city.",102,,
