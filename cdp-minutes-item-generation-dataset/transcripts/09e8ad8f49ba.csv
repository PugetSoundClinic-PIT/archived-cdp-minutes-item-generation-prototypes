336,0.97,3330.46,3339.903,If we could chop to the top of page 9.,72,,

341,0.97,3383.98,3401.564,You can see when combined with the unspent dollars appropriated in 2021 this resulted more than $70 million of funds available to spend in 2022.,73,,
342,0.97,3401.564,3414.477,Had also REVISES the proposed budget to make the one-time investments rather than ongoing until the Council and next year's Mayor able to identify funds to support these investments in an ongoing nature.,73,,
343,0.97,3414.477,3422.185,"If you could move to the next table at the top of, midway through the next page.",73,,
344,0.97,3422.185,3434.931,Combination of steps one and two is what allows for the freeing up of resources for other Council priorities.,73,,
345,0.97,3434.931,3447.143,And allows us to make adjustments to the proposed budget to make expenditures for 2022 consistent with the Jumpstart fund policies.,73,,

358,0.97,3571.534,3595.158,This year we anticipated the amount coming in for the investment dollars going to the priorities about $149 million should go to the Jumpstart fund plan.,75,,
359,0.97,3595.158,3605.935,"[Indiscernible] it was supposed to include $23 million going into economic revitalization and instead about 13% was--excuse me, $13 million was diverted.",75,,
360,0.97,3605.935,3630.159,And $14 million for each green new deal investment and--were the commitment . In total want to make sure we are correcting for the $62 million that would have been diverted from the Jumpstart priorities to other areas outside of the priorities.,75,,
361,0.97,3630.159,3641.904,We have identified one time find source using Federal dollars to allow for the investments to go forward.,75,,
362,0.97,3641.904,3644.874,We are not making a choice whether something is cut.,75,,
363,0.97,3644.874,3648.511,Everything included is being funded.,75,,
364,0.97,3648.511,3657.42,We are swapping the find a source making sure we are maintaining commitments as outlined.,75,,
365,0.97,3657.42,3660.69,I want to note the importance of this for affordable housing.,75,,
366,0.97,3660.69,3672.402,We codified making sure there was a known amounts . $100 million was supposed to go into affordable housing.,75,,
367,0.97,3672.402,3683.146,Because there is tremendous need over $100 million in projects submitted requests for this year [Indiscernible]. We were only able to provide about $35 million.,75,,
368,0.97,3683.146,3708.438,We know there is one other projects that applied for the strategic acquisition plan [Indiscernible]. There is tremendous need and we will be Partnering--to bank on future Jumpstart Fund so we can increase the--for projects that have submitted requests for this year as well.,75,,
369,0.97,3708.438,3719.148,Providing stable funding investments for housing is critical so planners can leverage the city funds and acquire additional financial strains for capital and future operation services.,75,,
370,0.97,3719.148,3733.262,We need to have known sources in affordable housing to allow for building to start now.,75,,
371,0.97,3738.367,3751.414,"If we see a reduction in the amount this year, we can assume the base year budget going forward will have the reduced amount and we are interested in correcting those revenue streams.",75,,
372,0.97,3751.414,3783.713,Along with this comes the next amendment which is committing to working with additional revenue streams . [Indiscernible] all I will notes [Indiscernible] to identify additional future revenue.,75,,
373,0.97,3783.713,3799.262,Looks--I will take questions now.,75,,
374,0.97,3799.262,3803.466,Thank you.,76,,
375,0.97,3803.466,3809.672,I have a few questions to understand the amendment in terms of numbers.,76,,
376,0.97,3809.672,3814.877,I will ask all of them and let you respond.,76,,
377,0.97,3814.877,3835.498,When the budget amendment says it restores the--am I right that what that means is it restores into the reduced level--given the economic crisis and everything.,76,,
378,0.97,3835.498,3845.875,There's an all spending plan--it would have required more funding for housing and green new deal.,76,,
379,0.97,3845.875,3847.21,That is one question.,76,,
380,0.97,3847.21,3859.422,My right that this budget amendment does not substantially increase funding for housing and green new deal?,76,,
381,0.97,3859.422,3874.003,It does so by small amount and it swaps around the sources of funding.,76,,
382,0.97,3874.003,3887.917,All the swapping bar and park on the--the city can fund.,76,,
383,0.97,3890.519,3960.222,"And the third is when the budget amendment says quote adjust the amount of funding for community safety investments and when combined with the--investment in these areas, I write that this amendment is--talks about recognizing carryforward . does that mean that funding that the black lives matter movement as largely not been spent and it is being carried forward to next year and this amendment--and saying there's money left over --",76,,
384,0.97,3960.222,3969.332,Thank you Councilmember Sawant . I think I noted the questions but let me know if I missed anything.,77,,
385,0.97,3969.332,3990.219,To your first question about whether or not the amendment would restore the amount or align the Jumpstart spending with the Jumpstart ordinance passed in 2021 or the original spending plan.,77,,
386,0.97,3990.219,3997.86,Current law would allow for up to $85 million of Jumpstart fund to support the base general fund expenditures in 2021 and beyond.,77,,
387,0.97,3997.86,4014.543,The amendment allies the spending with current law and not the previously adopted spending plans that have since been amended through adoption of the Jumpstart fund policies.,77,,
388,0.97,4014.543,4015.077,They are a less amount.,77,,
389,0.97,4015.077,4027.356,"I would note that absent support from the Jumpstart fund to Backfill general fund revenues, the Council would be looking at about $80 million of cuts to base services.",77,,
390,0.97,4027.356,4030.693,"That is why you made that decision, I believe, to allow for that expenditure.",77,,
391,0.97,4030.693,4048.11,"What this amendment does do is say that unlike the proposed budget, it will not allow the use and dependence on the general Fund and an ongoing basis.",77,,
392,0.97,4048.11,4054.717,"General fund revenues start to rebound, assuming they do, the amount of Jumpstart that could be used to support these services would be reduced.",77,,
393,0.97,4054.717,4055.151,You are correct.,77,,
394,0.97,4055.151,4066.729,Much of this amendment is Aligning the spending with the policy.,77,,
395,0.97,4066.729,4069.432,It is not significant changes right now in the amount of spending in the categories like affordable housing and green new deal.,77,,
396,0.97,4069.432,4086.215,The affordable housing category it increases the amount for investments in housing by about $8 million and it is a minor adjustment to the green new deal.,77,,
397,0.97,4086.215,4127.089,"And importantly, what it signals is that on an ongoing basis those amounts should not be reduced in future years opposed budgets and should increase as general fund revenues rebound . in terms of how we talk about the community led investments, last year the council passed a budget that included one time finding for the equitable community task force recommendations for--the proposed budget would add the same amount in 2022.",77,,
398,0.97,4127.089,4129.058,By relying on a larger proportion of the Jumpstart funds.,77,,
399,0.97,4129.058,4141.804,Relying on a revenue source that was not intended for the specific purposes and word continue to rely on that on an ongoing nature.,77,,
400,0.97,4141.804,4161.79,"My understanding is that the intent was for the Participatory budgeting as an example, there was $30 million appropriated in 2021 and about $27.2 million is still remaining fun is general that is awaiting the process pieces being set up so those decisions could be made.",77,,
401,0.97,4161.79,4168.931,"An additional $30 million was added, is in the proposed budget for that use.",77,,
402,0.97,4168.931,4187.249,The reason this amendment is looking at acknowledging the carryforward is that next year that could result in almost $60 million being available for the Participatory budgeting process and it could be a big spending cliff if there is not an identified revenue source.,77,,
403,0.97,4187.249,4211.674,"This allows for freeing up of Othr resources, but it is reducing the amount in the proposed budget and acknowledging the carryforward to ensure the same amount of dollars, $30 million in 2022 is available but acknowledges that under spend.",77,,
404,0.97,4211.674,4214.977,If we could Scroll back to the bottom of page 9 of the packet.,77,,
405,0.97,4214.977,4220.316,That table summarizes the 2022 appropriation.,77,,
406,0.97,4220.316,4230.492,"In the blue columns, the green is what was proposed . The blue, the first 2022 appropriation is what it would appropriate.",77,,
407,0.97,4230.492,4236.298,The middle is the phones that will not be spent in 2021.,77,,
408,0.97,4236.298,4240.102,And the total amount available for 2022.,77,,
409,0.97,4240.102,4257.453,"I will acknowledge the community safety line, that is inclusive of $3 million that the Council approved to increase the amount of funding available for the community safety capacity building in the Rfp.",77,,
410,0.97,4257.453,4265.995,That is not been spent in our understanding is will not be spent or contracted for in 2021.,77,,
411,0.97,4265.995,4269.598,I think I covered all the questions.,77,,
412,0.97,4269.598,4273.936,Thank you cell March,78,,
413,0.97,4273.936,4292.554,We will talk about the equitable community initiative in the next amendment . any additional questions?,79,,

417,0.97,4316.378,4319.982,I really appreciate the work you have done.,79,,
418,0.97,4319.982,4348.41,We will continue to see the revenue increase because we know companies and have high paid employees in the sector we see gross in the Tech industry specifically in a number of startups has grown in the wake of Covid.,79,,
419,0.97,4348.41,4353.515,We know revenue will stabilize.,79,,
420,0.97,4353.515,4369.498,"The amount we have allowed for to make sure we keep government services whole, we will see that go down.",79,,
421,0.97,4369.498,4382.077,"The full percentage, 62% going into affordable housing will grow even though that remains constant.",79,,
422,0.97,4386.715,4391.754,If there were no questions on this omnibus amendment I will new bond.,79,,
423,0.97,4391.754,4407.77,This is a statement of legislative intent sponsored by--I will NOTE this was broken into two amendments.,80,,
424,0.97,4407.77,4426.588,Statement of legislative intent expresses the Intel to identify an ongoing revenue source [Indiscernible] and the community safety investments authorized by Council.,80,,
425,0.97,4426.588,4442.571,This complements [Indiscernible] there are a number of changes and changes the investments in those areas and make them one time rather than ongoing.,80,,
426,0.97,4442.571,4451.78,This is confirming the intent to work next year that investments continued in future years.,80,,
427,0.97,4451.78,4480.142,I am interested in continuing to work on the language to make sure it reflects a task force to come up with recommendations for revenue streams in the future.,81,,
428,0.97,4480.142,4490.352,"In addition, there is a call for additional revenue . We want to make sure we are putting together a task force.",81,,
429,0.97,4490.352,4497.459,And it could include reductions to existing services toward traditional policing.,81,,
430,0.97,4497.459,4535.764,We want to make sure we are continuing our commitment to keep the investments at $30 million for Participatory budgeting--maintaining the human service--and we also have $4 million that was not in the Mayor's proposed budget for gun violence and youth die version.,81,,
431,0.97,4535.764,4541.603,That total would be maintained.,81,,
432,0.97,4541.603,4562.457,Showing up any spending to reflect [Indiscernible] so each of the categories have the amounts committed.,81,,
433,0.97,4579.174,4585.147,We want to make sure they have the full $30 million.,81,,
434,0.97,4585.147,4590.919,I think this Dovetails with many areas of the budget.,81,,
435,0.97,4590.919,4599.661,After this year we need to make sure there's not a cliff.,81,,
436,0.97,4599.661,4613.775,Will be equipped at the end of 2022 where half of the project or half of the funding would go away and we want to create stability and true investments to the tune we committed to.,81,,

So we can fund more upstream investments and investments part of that conversation and part of that strategy is for things like Participatory budgeting . The process is in development.,82,,
439,0.97,4650.312,4659.921,We will get a chance to see next year how the $30 million in investments and support efforts to build up alternatives to community safety.,82,,
440,0.97,4659.921,4706.535,I am looking forward to that process . It is my intent that this Participatory budget process does remain an ongoing effort to allow for community driven priorities and to share access to power and resources with neighbors .

477,0.97,5092.52,5122.684,But we need to consider was being disproportionately affected by the lack of access . So we really can become the world-class city we want to be.,93,,
478,0.97,5122.684,5128.89,That means having world-class public toilets.,93,,
479,0.97,5128.89,5136.164,Thank you so much.,94,,
480,0.97,5136.164,5147.876,I want to thank you for lifting up this public health need.,94,,
481,0.97,5157.051,5175.837,"For the reasons stated in the audit report and for the arguments, I would like to be added as a cosponsor.",94,,
482,0.97,5175.837,5182.644,I wanted to add [Indiscernible--low volume],95,,
483,0.97,5182.644,5187.515,Also adding her name.,96,,
484,0.97,5187.515,5195.256,Thank you very much.,96,,
485,0.97,5195.256,5196.124,Before we move on to another category.,96,,
486,0.97,5196.124,5198.059,I think I should double check.,96,,
487,0.97,5198.059,5205.166,At the end of each section to make sure there is no additional walk on amendments.,96,,
488,0.97,5205.166,5208.636,If there is you can help flag it for me before we move on.,96,,
489,0.97,5208.636,5214.475,That sounds great.,97,,
490,0.97,5214.475,5216.778,See nothing additional let's move to the next section.,98,,
491,0.97,5216.778,5220.148,Finance and administrative services,98,,
492,0.97,5220.148,5226.588,Department of finance and administrative services for breathing and discussion.,99,,
493,0.97,5226.588,5230.191,Thank you very much.,100,,
494,0.97,5230.191,5252.28,"The first Council budget amendment is sponsored by Councilmember Strauss . It would add $200,000 in one time general fund to FAS for a consultant led study of public safety staffing on city water was.",101,,
495,0.97,5252.28,5258.886,The goal could be a baseline first.,101,,
496,0.97,5258.886,5263.992,Is there anything to add?,102,,
497,0.97,5263.992,5282.31,"This would add $200,000 to contract with an independent consultant to ensure public safety and all types of safety on our waterways.",103,,
498,0.97,5282.31,5288.85,It is needed to understand what a Water-Based safety needs are.,103,,
499,0.97,5288.85,5291.719,What is the level of service we need on our waterways?,103,,
500,0.97,5291.719,5296.257,The answer to that question is currently unknown.,103,,
501,0.97,5296.257,5317.145,"We have seen an increase in recreation, Paddle boarding, Kayaking, people renting . We have seen an increase in boating . This is a crime on Lake Washington and out on the Puget sound.",103,,
502,0.97,5317.145,5320.481,We have had two things occur.,103,,
503,0.97,5320.481,5331.159,We have had this increase in recreation and in the last year we have had harbor patrol had half of their staff go on long term leave.,103,,
504,0.97,5331.159,5338.366,Harbor patrol has previously been one of the entities responding to these crisis.,103,,
505,0.97,5338.366,5346.674,Last night cell fire Department responded to a potential Surfer.,103,,
506,0.97,5346.674,5353.681,There was not anyone.,103,,
507,0.97,5353.681,5370.198,Just to say that this is to understand what comparisons are.,103,,
508,0.97,5372.1,5386.114,"Even before harbor patrol had half the staff go on leave, we only had three vessels on all waterways . The question is, is that the right staffing?",103,,
509,0.97,5386.114,5413.074,"Use answers are unknown at this time and we need to have a third-party consultant much like the National student for criminal justice reform produced a study for us better understanding how we need to transition from gun and badge this responses and we need a consultant to tell us what are the staffing needs of our waterways . If we don't know what the benchmark is to meet, we cannot create a Pathway to meet it.",103,,
510,0.97,5413.074,5415.843,Thank you.,103,,
511,0.97,5415.843,5434.061,Quickly I want to thank you for bringing forward the action.,104,,
512,0.97,5437.865,5452.513,I think many of us are looking for not just about the needs on the waterways but can best do that work.,104,,
513,0.97,5452.513,5462.757,Thank you.,105,,
514,0.97,5465.46,5474.836,Thank you Councilmember Strauss for bringing the proposal forward.,105,,
515,0.97,5474.836,5478.639,This is more for the viewing public and harbor patrol Stakeholders.,105,,
516,0.97,5478.639,5495.356,I think it is evident as we have a high rate of attrition in the Seattle police Department and under no scenario could there be recruiting or retention to immediately replace all of that attrition.,105,,
517,0.97,5495.356,5507.468,And ultimately harbor patrol staffing is going to an extent be contingent on the priority the Department puts on Refilling it.,105,,
518,0.97,5507.468,5518.145,This is a necessary action to see what can be done to change the staffing plan to have a functioning harbor patrol.,105,,
519,0.97,5518.145,5533.361,I don't feel like I am speculating too much to say in the near term it will likely not be a high staffing priority.,105,,
520,0.97,5533.361,5539.467,Which makes the study necessary to figure out how we can maintain the critical services in a more Adaptive way.,105,,
521,0.97,5539.467,5549.41,This is the first step in that direction and I appreciate your leadership in bringing this forward.,105,,
522,0.97,5549.41,5553.114,Thank you very much.,106,,
523,0.97,5553.114,5557.985,Let's move on to the next item.,106,,
524,0.97,5557.985,5578.906,"I am introducing this, add $227,000 to the general fund ongoing to FAS to add two FTE positions to the Seattle animal shelter.",107,,
525,0.97,5578.906,5585.212,This is sponsored by Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Lewis.,107,,
526,0.97,5585.212,5587.915,Any additional comments?,108,,
527,0.97,5587.915,5594.922,This would Fund two positions at the Seattle animal shelter to better meet the needs of the shelter.,109,,
528,0.97,5594.922,5605.466,"The shelter is not in my district, oftentimes people forget about the animal shelter because it is in a nondescript building.",109,,
529,0.97,5605.466,5607.268,This building and this building serves the entire city.,109,,
530,0.97,5607.268,5612.74,"The first position is a behavioral list, which is an existing position.",109,,
531,0.97,5612.74,5617.979,Unfortunately it is temporary and funded by grants and donations.,109,,
532,0.97,5617.979,5663.124,"The importance of a behavioral list is they work with the animals to improve behaviors and facilitate adoptions and work with Adopters to ensure animals do not need to be returned to the shelter and by making this decision permanent, it will help the animal shelter continue to be a leader in ensuring dogs and all animals are able to change the behaviors rather than Unfortunately need to be put down in some circumstances Seattle animal shelter is a leader in making sure that dogs and other animals don't have to be put down and that is because of this position.",109,,
533,0.97,5663.124,5667.194,Would make sure that position is permanent.,109,,
534,0.97,5667.194,5679.44,And if they can have grants and donations it would expand their ability to Rehouse animals in a meaningful way.,109,,
535,0.97,5679.44,5680.408,Second position is for foster care manager.,109,,
536,0.97,5680.408,5682.51,This is a position which the animal shelter has previously had but was caught several years ago.,109,,
537,0.97,5682.51,5685.713,Volunteers are struggling.,109,,
538,0.97,5685.713,5692.153,Volunteers are managing the foster care system.,109,,
539,0.97,5692.153,5695.656,They are struggling to do this.,109,,
540,0.97,5695.656,5725.92,"All the importance of this is while the animal shelter is a leader it is reliant on having animals nearby and this can create behavioral issues . by having foster homes, it provides a safe and adjusted place to live.",109,,
541,0.97,5725.92,5730.558,These requests are connected.,109,,
542,0.97,5730.558,5738.799,Ensuring that we are not relying on volunteers.,109,,
543,0.97,5738.799,5741.402,Thank you.,110,,
544,0.97,5741.402,5743.771,Any additional comments?,110,,
545,0.97,5743.771,5746.707,Let's move on.,110,,
546,0.97,5746.707,5757.785,This will proviso spending in FAS for animal control officer patrols in city parks.,111,,
547,0.97,5757.785,5770.998,This is sponsored by Councilmember Herbold . and is also cosponsored by Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Strauss.,111,,
548,0.97,5770.998,5797.458,"It would impose a proviso on the animal shelter budget and would restrict $380,000 of General fund spending to be spent only for animal control positions dedicated to enforcing [Indiscernible] and it is generated from calculating the annual cost to support those positions.",111,,
549,0.97,5797.458,5813.007,This is a topic I hear from constituents who are seeking additional off leash enforcement.,112,,
550,0.97,5813.007,5822.817,I think it works well with the proposal . The proposal would add positions for animal control.,112,,
551,0.97,5822.817,5829.29,This is not impact that priority.,112,,
552,0.97,5829.29,5835.396,It takes a look at the existing positions that are unfilled.,112,,
553,0.97,5835.396,5841.202,There are number of vacancies and FAS noted the challenge they have had in hiring new animal control officers in the last few years.,112,,
554,0.97,5841.202,5866.327,"What this would do, it would not add more Positios, we felt it would make sense to add more positions, given the vacancies, but it would increase the number of existing positions that are dedicated to animal control in parks . right now there are two for all of the parks in the city up to four.",112,,
555,0.97,5866.327,5882.509,With the goal of additional monitoring of parks . and those that have dogs will adhere to off leash laws.,112,,
556,0.97,5882.509,5888.449,Thank you.,113,,
557,0.97,5888.449,5891.819,Moving on.,113,,
558,0.97,5891.819,5911.872,Sponsored by Councilmember Lewis . It will request that the executive provide recommendations and draft amendments to the city Short- term rental ordinance.,114,,
559,0.97,5911.872,5929.69,Currently Renters can only operate short-term rentals in a specific area of the downtown and this amendment is based on the objective that all tenants in the city should be able to offer their primary residence for short term rental use.,114,,
560,0.97,5929.69,5932.559,Thank you very much.,115,,
561,0.97,5932.559,5977.938,"I would say there's been some interesting requests in the community about an area that was not envisioned in our original short term rental ordinance, what about a scenario where there is a tenant who does for a short period of time, say three days, want to offer their primary residence where they are the resident tenant for some kind of opportunity that it could be listed on a Short- term rental company . Airbnb the most famous but there are other Úshort-Term rentals that have this kind of model.",116,,
562,0.97,5977.938,5998.225,For obvious reasons it was not envisioned initially in the original ordinance for the possibility of displacement of Renters for the possibility of taking space that should be rental stock and potentially turning it into a speculative investment.,116,,
563,0.97,5998.225,6013.574,I think it is a little bit different when you look at cities that have a model that have a resident tenant requirement where that is the primary residence of the tenants and therefore offering it as a short-term rental opportunity when they are out of town.,116,,
564,0.97,6013.574,6038.899,"There's ways to potentially explore and Revisit this to see if it would potentially provide an opportunity for tenants to take advantage of some of these laws we have around short-term rentals as long as it does not have a demonstrable, negative impact on housing supply or an impact on increasing the cost of housing.",116,,
565,0.97,6038.899,6046.407,And that is really what this would get toward.,116,,
566,0.97,6046.407,6069.296,"Examining this question and see if it is not to update the requirement so we are not walking so many in the people out in the city, given we are a majority Renters city and given there are cities that are doing this currently.",116,,
567,0.97,6069.296,6074.034,I think Denver and Atlanta are currently doing some variation of this.,116,,
568,0.97,6074.034,6084.945,That is essentially what is being requested . I am happy to direct additional questions.,116,,
569,0.97,6084.945,6087.047,Thank you.,117,,
570,0.97,6087.047,6090.951,Any additional comments or questions?,117,,
571,0.97,6090.951,6092.619,I will be brief.,118,,
572,0.97,6092.619,6111.638,You know we are 51% Renters in district 5. we have a market and I think it is a good idea that we have tenants working with landlords for economic opportunity.,118,,
573,0.97,6111.638,6135.863,"So we can avoid displacement and actually have a relationship that works well for sure term that Renters have the same access to the same economic activity . people are more transient in the economic community that could provide at least in district 5 with the onslaught of well over 3000 more units coming Online, not just market rate Condo ownership but rental units.",118,,
574,0.97,6135.863,6142.269,I think this is a great opportunity to explore.,118,,
575,0.97,6142.269,6146.707,Thank you.,119,,
576,0.97,6146.707,6152.012,This might be a question for an.,120,,
577,0.97,6152.012,6164.825,I think what we are suggesting or what is being suggested is allowing tenants to basically Sublet their units if they are gone . which I think is a cause for Eviction.,120,,
578,0.97,6164.825,6169.329,I just want to get a little bit of clarity of what we are discussing.,120,,
579,0.97,6169.329,6190.05,The amendment is specific that this proposed new use by tenants is only permissible when they have the permission of the unit owner or property owner's representative . There may be some owners who decide they don't want to make this opportunity available to tenants.,121,,
580,0.97,6190.05,6202.663,"For those who do, this amendment would allow something that is not currently permissible under the city ordinance.",121,,
581,0.97,6202.663,6204.364,Thank you.,122,,
582,0.97,6204.364,6208.168,Thank you for the call questions.,122,,
583,0.97,6208.168,6212.272,I don't see any additional questions let's move on.,122,,
584,0.97,6212.272,6217.945,Good morning.,123,,
585,0.97,6217.945,6234.394,"Sponsored by Councilmember Lewis . It would add $360,000 general fund to FAS to establish a victim compensation Fund and provide for Community-Based organization support.",123,,
586,0.97,6234.394,6240.1,"The fund would be $100,000.",123,,
587,0.97,6240.1,6264.324,"$50,000 intended to go to an organization to conduct outreach to fictive that have experienced financial loss and might be eligible for compensation and $200,000 we go to an organization of community members for a longer-term restorative response to the criminal legal system including how such funds might be housed in the community.",123,,
588,0.97,6264.324,6273.4,This is two things combined into one request.,124,,
589,0.97,6273.4,6293.153,The first is a victim compensation fund to fill a critical whole we currently have in our restorative system locally.,124,,
590,0.97,6293.153,6300.127,The restorative justice practice is to make victims whole as part of the process of Community-Based accountability.,124,,
591,0.97,6300.127,6321.782,"Restorative justice does not ask victims to not seek some kind of redress for a harm they have experienced . In Seattle where we have a local criminal legal system that revolves entirely around Misdemeanors, there are many cases in a given year that involve some level of loss.",124,,
592,0.97,6321.782,6349.376,"Typically for a small dollar amount otherwise it would not be a misdemeanor . $100,000 will go a long way to repair damage to property . cover minor expenses related to misdemeanor assault injury recovery . money for property damage to a window.",124,,
593,0.97,6349.376,6351.978,Things that end up in the misdemeanor court.,124,,
594,0.97,6351.978,6370.33,And it is really critical because under the current system where you have an overwhelming majority of defendants in the Seattle municipal court you are indigent unlikely to remain in this pigeon for the dependency of resolving the case.,124,,
595,0.97,6370.33,6375.535,Restitution is ordered to be paid by the defendant.,124,,
596,0.97,6375.535,6381.141,"But as they are judgment proof, no one gets paid.",124,,
597,0.97,6381.141,6388.949,Because it is not possible for people to get compensation from completely indigent defendants.,124,,
598,0.97,6388.949,6390.283,This would provide a mechanism to make sure victims are whole.,124,,
599,0.97,6390.283,6395.155,"I can speak from personal expense as a Prosecutor, most victims want to be made whole.",124,,
600,0.97,6395.155,6404.03,They don't necessarily want to come forward and Litigate against a criminal defendant.,124,,
601,0.97,6404.03,6409.403,This makes restorative alternatives viable and allows us to build into that kind of system.,124,,
602,0.97,6409.403,6437.597,"The last thing I would say, there were massive inequities in the current system in the ability of defendants who have been the victim of a crime, similarly are experiencing extreme poverty, have low trust of the existing system or a difficult to find given the existing ways we communicate with victims.",124,,
603,0.97,6437.597,6447.073,You are never contacted to determine if they would like to seek compensation or if there's a way to reach them.,124,,
604,0.97,6447.073,6454.781,To even get the compensation in the first place.,124,,
605,0.97,6454.781,6466.226,Part of this would be capacity building for Community-Based organizations to establish contact with the full scope of the rooms that interact with our municipal court through credible Community-Based organizations.,124,,
606,0.97,6466.226,6503.964,To make sure people eligible for compensation are in a position where they can get that compensation . Under the current system there is a high rate of people refusing to communicate . I would add the organizational capacity building probably has lots of other benefits that go beyond the compensation Fund . In building capacity and restorative justice.,124,,
607,0.97,6503.964,6517.377,In terms of building their ability to do system navigation and victim support beyond just delivering the compensation fund which is why I think it is best articulated as two requests.,124,,
608,0.97,6517.377,6531.258,"$100,000 for the compensation Fund and another set of money in the proposal for broader capacity building for restorative justice programming.",124,,
609,0.97,6531.258,6533.727,I will turn it back over to the chair.,124,,
610,0.97,6533.727,6538.198,Thank you very much.,125,,
611,0.97,6538.198,6541.101,I just want to add a couple things.,126,,
612,0.97,6541.101,6555.715,The recommendations are very timely in that they are addressing what we are hearing from experts who work in this area.,126,,
613,0.97,6555.715,6577.504,The city attorney's office has--in city and county's--as part of the grant team and that particular working group recommended the city attorney's office set up a victim compensation Fund.,126,,
614,0.97,6577.504,6587.247,The community task force on criminal legal system alignment had a series of recommendations specifically focused on restitution.,126,,
615,0.97,6587.247,6594.955,I want to say--for bringing this forward.,126,,
616,0.97,6594.955,6611.905,But thank you for making sure the recommendation incorporates the guidance from the community alignment and is consistent with the principles of the task force.,126,,
617,0.97,6611.905,6615.375,Thank you very much.,127,,
618,0.97,6615.375,6623.049,Thank you for the smart policy addition to the budget.,128,,
619,0.97,6623.049,6628.488,I would like to add my name to the list.,128,,
620,0.97,6628.488,6633.593,'s,128,,
621,0.97,6633.593,6643.937,Let's continue.,129,,
622,0.97,6647.073,6657.017,This should be the last item and may FAS category.,130,,
623,0.97,6657.017,6661.988,"Who would add $80,000 of one time general fund to FAS for connecting camp second chance to the sewer system.",130,,

625,0.97,6674.2,6684.144,This is one of three actions related to camp second chance.,131,,
626,0.97,6684.144,6702.662,The three budget actions would enable expansion of camp second chance to include an additional 20 tiny houses and address long- standing issues as we heard on public comment today.,131,,
627,0.97,6702.662,6704.531,It provides for a sewer connection.,131,,
628,0.97,6704.531,6724.984,And will have hygiene trailers service and it would be a walk on on Thursday related to funding for construction of 20 new units.,131,,
629,0.97,6724.984,6726.686,These three actions together to help address Long-Standing issues at the site.,131,,
630,0.97,6726.686,6727.821,Currently the site is not connected to a sewer line.,131,,
631,0.97,6727.821,6736.062,For more than five years camp second chance has been at this location.,131,,
632,0.97,6736.062,6742.702,Villagers have had to use Porta Potty's and have not had regular access to showers.,131,,
633,0.97,6742.702,6745.605,My office shared materials by Email yesterday evening.,131,,
634,0.97,6745.605,6762.088,Noting that tiny House villages provide outcomes that are associated with exits from tiny House villages into permanent housing at the rate of 24.7%.,131,,
635,0.97,6762.088,6773.233,"6% have moved--I'm sorry, 47% moved into permanent housing and 6% moved into transitional housing in 2020.",131,,
636,0.97,6773.233,6804.864,"Consistent with councils efforts to expand down the House villages, I am looking at expanding the camp that is brought our communities together.",131,,
637,0.97,6804.864,6815.842,There are religious and community organizations that have come together to help camp second chance.,131,,
638,0.97,6815.842,6826.252,Thank you very much.,132,,
639,0.97,6826.653,6839.566,I really appreciate all of these three measures that Councilmember Herbold foreshadowed for can't second chance to be expanded.,132,,
640,0.97,6839.566,6858.384,The cornerstone of our effort to expand shelter capacity and this Council has been really United in pursuing an aggressive strategy about shelter expansion.,132,,
641,0.97,6858.384,6863.79,That has not always been embraced by external Stakeholders.,132,,
642,0.97,6863.79,6893.553,"But a key cornerstone has been looking at opportunities for the establishment of new villages, but if it is faster and takes care of citing the new villages, and expanding existing villages where possible, camp second chance is a great opportunity to do that and make good on overdue promises to bring it to the same quality of life that other tiny House villages are experiencing.",132,,
643,0.97,6893.553,6918.444,I appreciate this opportunity in this budget cycle to make good on those commitments and provide more capacity . making sure can't second chance remains a great place to live in shelter while Transitioning to housing.,132,,
644,0.97,6918.444,6918.811,Thank you.,133,,
645,0.97,6918.811,6923.95,And thank you for your help on that.,133,,

650,0.97,6985.545,6994.954,I just want to request to be added as a cosponsor.,136,,
651,0.97,6994.954,7022.849,"We have had a lot of conversations about Tony House villages and their ongoing viability as part of the spectrum of interventions we offer individuals who are in need of safer housing options, as we work to scale up those permanent supportive housing options and transitional housing options.",136,,
652,0.97,7022.849,7029.155,We hear that we need to improve the conditions at the Tony House villages.,136,,
653,0.97,7029.155,7052.712,This is a key way for us to continue to improve the conditions while we stay focused and not lose focus--appreciate an opportunity to signal support on this one as well.,136,,
654,0.97,7052.712,7060.42,Thank you very much.,137,,
655,0.97,7060.42,7060.82,Adding your name.,137,,
656,0.97,7060.82,7069.095,I have a question . Perhaps for the Sponsoror central staff.,138,,
657,0.97,7069.095,7102.462,"[Indiscernible] all of the items related to tiny houses, do we have conversations or commitments that when we advance priorities specific to any Tony House village or support in general there is ongoing commitment and implementation that will be followed through from our partners?",138,,
658,0.97,7102.462,7105.465,I will go first to give you coverage.,139,,
659,0.97,7105.465,7113.84,And you fill in . I would say Madam chair to speak specifically to those.,139,,
660,0.97,7113.84,7118.344,We are expanding an existing village.,139,,
661,0.97,7118.344,7127.053,I think the square is fine within the architecture of the assets we hand over.,139,,
662,0.97,7127.053,7135.061,This is not strictly speaking expanding the number of villages but rather expanding an existing one.,139,,
663,0.97,7135.061,7144.737,I feel pretty confident stating that.,139,,
664,0.97,7144.737,7161.921,"In terms of broader system expansion, I know regional homelessness authority would like to build up and then assess the entire system envisioning the six new villages that this Council has funded and are anticipated to be stood up . Three villages are opening this fall.",139,,
665,0.97,7161.921,7166.893,Three additional villages would be stood up in response to an Rfq that the authority is assuring.,139,,
666,0.97,7166.893,7169.829,That is expected in the first quarter of 2022.,139,,
667,0.97,7169.829,7173.633,Some of that might have been incorrect.,139,,
668,0.97,7173.633,7184.31,That is my current understanding of where things stand.,139,,
669,0.97,7184.31,7186.812,I would imagine it would be fine because we are expanding an existing village.,139,,
670,0.97,7186.812,7188.347,Anything to add?,140,,
671,0.97,7188.347,7197.123,A few things for the record.,141,,
672,0.97,7197.123,7202.228,I don't think you said anything incorrect but I would add a couple of additional points.,141,,
673,0.97,7202.228,7213.539,"To the direct question, we don't have direct assurances that additions earmarked for specific village would be followed through on.",141,,
674,0.97,7213.539,7215.174,That is not been a conversation we have needed to have at this point.,141,,
675,0.97,7215.174,7230.389,I will note that the lived experience has issued statements--very focused on centering of voices with people with lived experience.,141,,
676,0.97,7230.389,7249.075,"The conversation that Councilmember Lewis referred to for the continued expansion and the Rfp, all envision levels of service along the lines of actually having toilets are not for the parties.",141,,
677,0.97,7249.075,7258.417,It would be the type of facility that people would want to utilize.,141,,
678,0.97,7258.417,7270.93,It seems in line with other statements that have been made on the quality of services that the authority is interested in providing at any shelter location . But these have not been directly addressed.,141,,
679,0.97,7270.93,7280.039,Very helpful.,142,,
680,0.97,7280.039,7282.041,This is good news.,142,,
681,0.97,7282.041,7287.747,Believe we are at the end of FAS.,142,,
682,0.97,7287.747,7291.15,Are we ready to move on?,142,,
683,0.97,7291.15,7298.557,Legislative Department for briefing and discussion.,143,,
684,0.97,7298.557,7301.46,Good morning again.,144,,
685,0.97,7301.46,7313.873,"This is a Council budget action to add $600,000 to the legislative Department.",145,,
686,0.97,7313.873,7332.591,Sponsored by Councilmember Gonzalez . specifically this action would find two existing positions in the central staff division that were vacant and unfunded in 2021.,145,,
687,0.97,7332.591,7334.427,It would restore funding for the city clerk's office in several job Reclassifications.,145,,
688,0.97,7334.427,7338.164,Provide funding to address pay equity for Council staff.,145,,
689,0.97,7338.164,7349.008,"Restore funding to the Council consulting budget and finally used to prepare the Council chambers for hybrid, in person and virtual meetings.",145,,
690,0.97,7349.008,7358.384,Thank you.,146,,
691,0.97,7358.384,7371.33,"As you might recall the legislative Department did take merely a $700,000 cut with the 2021 budget in order to support citywide 5% budget reductions that were necessary due to the pandemic related economic conditions.",146,,
692,0.97,7371.33,7383.042,The additional funds proposed in this action are necessary to partially restore the cuts the legislative Department realized in 2021.,146,,
693,0.97,7383.042,7390.282,And is also necessary to address additional needs and the departments wide budget.,146,,
694,0.97,7390.282,7405.264,There were multiple vacant positions that were left unfilled for extended periods of time to accommodate the 5% budget reduction that we imposed in 2021.,146,,
695,0.97,7405.264,7416.976,"With the city's recent economic recovery and stabilization of revenue projections, the legislative Department plans to fill the vacant positions.",146,,
696,0.97,7416.976,7426.452,That will provide the Council with a more substantial consultant budget after reductions to that line item in 2020 and 2021.,146,,
697,0.97,7426.452,7437.096,And it would allow for new and additional spending in a couple of critical categories.,146,,
698,0.97,7437.096,7447.773,"First is technology upgrades to the Council chambers to allow for hybrid, in person and virtual meetings as well as an increased of Council office to address pay equity issues that have continued for the last 5-6 years.",146,,
699,0.97,7447.773,7461.187,The need for increased budget dates back to 2015 when a fourth full-time equivalent was added to each Councilmember staff but only funded with 50% of the necessary funds.,146,,
700,0.97,7461.187,7465.624,For that additional FTE.,146,,
701,0.97,7465.624,7482.908,The impact of this action was the typical legislative aide wages well below comparable salaries and similar institutions particularly as it relates to King County legislative aide function and role.,146,,
702,0.97,7482.908,7487.847,This will create slightly more pay equity for those particular positions within our offices.,146,,
703,0.97,7487.847,7494.086,That is what is represented by the entirety of this particular proposed amendment.,146,,
704,0.97,7494.086,7504.63,I want to thank the cosponsors.,146,,
705,0.97,7507.533,7518.444,Thank you so much . I want to thank you for your work for making sure we were addressing this equity need.,147,,

707,0.97,7526.352,7555.614,We have been working hard to make sure we--I think this goes a long way to make sure that we are fully staffed and working toward more equitable pay . We will do more to address the legislative AIDS.,147,,
708,0.97,7555.614,7576.936,We need to make sure that with--we want to make sure we are investing equitably and our staff.,147,,

710,0.97,7592.518,7599.124,Several of us had similar ideas about how to bolster the legislative Department.,148,,
711,0.97,7599.124,7612.371,I am happy to support this amendment . It benefits the entire city government when the legislative Department or legislative branch is appropriately staffed and we are supporting workers here.,148,,
712,0.97,7612.371,7619.078,"There are only 100 or so with Department employees while there are 12,000 in the executive branch.",148,,
713,0.97,7619.078,7633.759,We should not be shy about supporting our legislative Department so we provide the best service to our constituents and the policymaking as a whole.,148,,

722,0.97,7671.096,7672.031,We will move on to the next section.,153,,
723,0.97,7672.031,7676.535,We are looking at agenda item five.,153,,
724,0.97,7676.535,7678.704,Mayor's office.,154,,
725,0.97,7678.704,7680.639,For breathing and discussion.,154,,
726,0.97,7680.639,7688.647,Thank you very much.,155,,
727,0.97,7688.647,7735.394,"From the Mayor's office we have a statement of legislative intent that will request that the Mayor's office submit to the Council recommendations for creating an independent chief Arborist position to oversee the city's management of trees with an initial focus on the preservation of exceptional trees . This response will be do to the committee or its successor committee by April 8, 2022.",156,,
728,0.97,7735.394,7755.013,I know we want to do more to adapt to the crisis of climate change and a key part of that resiliency is conserving what we can of the environmental of infrastructure of the urban trees.,157,,
729,0.97,7755.013,7765.09,Management number city trees is scattered across several departments but there is no unifying person who advocates for trees internally.,157,,
730,0.97,7765.09,7767.526,Of the cities have chief Arborist.,157,,
731,0.97,7767.526,7774.133,Others have a chief Arborist.,157,,
732,0.97,7774.133,7777.636,This is a statement of legislative intent.,157,,
733,0.97,7777.636,7787.513,To have the Mayor's office consult all the relevant departments and return the Council with a proposal to create the position of chief Arborist.,157,,
734,0.97,7787.513,7799.558,The position could include a rapid review of removal of exceptional trees which are typically the largest trees that provide Seattle with the most benefits for residents.,157,,
735,0.97,7799.558,7807.8,During recent heat waves and the cooling benefits of trees were reinforced and the negative impact of tree removal.,157,,
736,0.97,7807.8,7811.57,I believe it is time for Seattle to have a chief Arborist.,157,,
737,0.97,7811.57,7815.34,Thank you.,157,,
738,0.97,7815.34,7825.851,Do you mind repeating the cities that have achieved Arborist? that you noted.,158,,
739,0.97,7825.851,7840.732,"A lot of cities call them the lead city Arborist those that call them chief Arborist, Dallas, Charlotte are just a couple that come to mind.",159,,

741,0.97,7846.271,7850.909,Thank you very much.,160,,
742,0.97,7850.909,7857.616,One thing we have heard about in the past has been how the Arborist role is shared.,160,,
743,0.97,7857.616,7872.798,Is it your vision that they would be located in one place but there is the possibility of coordinating with different departments . to enhance existing organizational chart?,160,,
744,0.97,7872.798,7874.233,Yes.,161,,
745,0.97,7874.233,7876.535,Great.,162,,
746,0.97,7876.535,7884.042,I saw that Lisa came off mute.,163,,
747,0.97,7884.042,7886.511,I'm not sure if she had something to add.,163,,
748,0.97,7886.511,7889.014,Thank you for the question.,163,,
749,0.97,7889.014,7895.754,I was going to ask that question.,163,,
750,0.97,7895.754,7921.913,I have not had an opportunity to read the specific language by can you talk about whether it includes any language related to racial equity in this particular position or analysis of sort of the underlying you know suite of potential recommendations that can be generated by this position?,163,,
751,0.97,7921.913,7926.184,I would expect that they would be required to do that.,164,,
752,0.97,7926.184,7930.889,That would just be part of the creation of the position.,164,,
753,0.97,7930.889,7933.692,But I would be happy to add that language.,164,,
754,0.97,7933.692,7960.018,"I think that because the arguments around climate change are being made to support the creation of a chief Arborist position, I think it would be imperative that any kind of effort be driven by the city's environmental justice goals.",165,,
755,0.97,7960.018,7980.539,"And that there would be a strong racial equity lens imposed upon any creation of a new position and/or defining functions and priorities related to the body of work that would be assigned to a chief Arborist, should that position be formed.",165,,
756,0.97,7980.539,7983.942,I totally agree.,166,,
757,0.97,7983.942,7985.01,We would absolutely one that.,166,,
758,0.97,7985.01,7994.052,"We see the racial, negative racial disparities with the removal of trees.",166,,
759,0.97,7994.052,8000.158,All we want is alarm panel benefits to be where they have not been in the past.,166,,
760,0.97,8000.158,8003.161,All I would welcome that.,166,,
761,0.97,8003.161,8018.143,And in terms of because the amendments as they are published Online I'm happy to hear about the process if we add a sentence or Delete a sentence from the various amendments.,166,,
762,0.97,8018.143,8019.745,I know central staff is listening and I support that clarity.,166,,
763,0.97,8019.745,8021.079,Thank you.,167,,
764,0.97,8021.079,8046.972,This is a great opportunity for Councilmembers to identify shared priorities and voice where you would like to see some enhancements or clarification . Central staff is taking notes . As we craft the proposed package . This will be formative for the language that ends up in the draft budget.,167,,
765,0.97,8046.972,8053.912,We will have an opportunity for further amendments once the draft budget is available and we can offer clarity.,167,,
766,0.97,8053.912,8062.721,I am noting that you are saying very similar things.,167,,
767,0.97,8062.721,8065.991,Anything to add to that?,167,,
768,0.97,8065.991,8078.37,I would just note to make sure it is clear we will update and modify the amendment that will be part of the balancing package.,168,,
769,0.97,8078.37,8084.91,"If there items that don't end up in the balancing package, you will not be updating these documents.",168,,
770,0.97,8084.91,8089.047,This is a launching point for the discussion.,169,,
771,0.97,8089.047,8090.015,Thank you.,169,,
772,0.97,8090.015,8094.252,Thank you for the question and clarification.,169,,
773,0.97,8094.252,8102.36,I agree and thank you for noting your interest in expanding upon that element.,169,,

780,0.97,8159.784,8164.022,Thank you.,173,,
781,0.97,8164.022,8181.039,I look at this in a similar vein to the capacity building in the legislative Department itself . The Office of the city auditor is such a critical resource for the oversight portion of this Council.,173,,
782,0.97,8181.039,8196.354,We should take this opportunity to protect and enhance the ability of the auditor to drive accountability and delivery of executive services at the city of Seattle.,173,,
783,0.97,8196.354,8217.142,"We have seen over the last couple of years a lot of really big conflicts in the public and disagreements in the public between the Council and the executive over how executive services are delivered . The efficacy of executive services and addressing big systemic issues like homelessness, transportation funding priorities and keep going down the list.",173,,
784,0.97,8217.142,8231.289,"Úone of the biggest tools that we have is a legislative Department is working with the city auditor was also a legislative branch official, which is not always made clear in the public.",173,,
785,0.97,8231.289,8235.26,The auditor is an independent official appointed by this Council without executive input.,173,,
786,0.97,8235.26,8249.541,"And our ability to get exceptionally high quality, Award-Winning analysis and assessment from a great auditing team that is help this Council look into bridge funding.",173,,
787,0.97,8249.541,8254.312,We have a pending audit on sidewalk repair that will come out.,173,,
788,0.97,8254.312,8285.61,Audits on all sorts of Earlybird priorities that have come down related to public safety investments related to homelessness policy related to the navigation team which have been validating of long-held Council priorities and have shown that there are more efficacious practices we can pursue as a city we can empirically prove it by bringing forward this critical work from the office of the city auditor.,173,,
789,0.97,8285.61,8300.258,Earlier this year my office into the auditor's office to explore what capacity Enhancement could look like.,173,,
790,0.97,8300.258,8319.377,"This is a proposal that the auditor's office would allow them to add considerably more ability to dog Council requested Audits, Audits requested for members of the public, follow up on auditing recommendation that have made.",173,,
791,0.97,8319.377,8326.484,But have not been fully realized.,173,,
792,0.97,8326.484,8330.989,This is essentially the high water mark of what can be assumed in one budget cycle in one year.,173,,
793,0.97,8330.989,8375.2,I think this could considerably enhance our critical responsibility under the charter to maintain oversight of executive departments and also to drive more effective service delivery practices as our role as a city council in close partnership and allow us to pursue more of these kind of initiatives and what we are currently outfitted to do and it would bring us closer to--King County government invests a lot more in their auditor's office then we do with the city of Seattle.,173,,
794,0.97,8375.2,8389.948,And I think that is led to King County developing a reputation for being ineffective and Well- run government.,173,,
795,0.97,8389.948,8399.758,Like us to be in a position where our municipality is second to nobody and being able to go to the public and say we have effective feedback loops.,173,,
796,0.97,8399.758,8410.835,I think this proposal gets us closer to that and really helps us be in a position where we are meeting the Charter obligation for oversight.,173,,
797,0.97,8410.835,8413.972,I will turn it back over to the chair.,173,,
798,0.97,8413.972,8415.073,Thank you.,174,,
799,0.97,8415.073,8419.077,Any additional questions.,174,,
800,0.97,8419.077,8439.864,Just wanting to note I rely on the auditor's reports for our policymaking and it is so important to understand if the policies we are creating our meeting the mark in which they are intended want to think the sponsor for bringing this forward.,175,,
801,0.97,8439.864,8447.672,Adding your name.,176,,
802,0.97,8447.672,8496.754,I want to thank Councilmember Lewis for being for this additional item here I will not advocate against this particular amendment but I want to put a few things into the record to consider . We will continue to have conversations with the sponsor of this item as well as with auditor Jones on this sort of Practicalities of implementation of this particular request.,176,,
803,0.97,8496.754,8519.777,I do want to note that the distinction s one of whether we want to grow the city auditor's office in addition to addressing some of the budget reductions they experienced last year.,176,,
804,0.97,8519.777,8555.813,Mayo's proposed budget does restore funding to the city auditor's office to allow for it to get to its baseline capacity that Preexisted the Covid related budget reductions the city auditor office was one of the only departments actually citywide that actually realized some budget impacts as a result of that reduction last year . So I am pleased the Mayor's proposed budget included a restoration of the city auditor's budget to allow for it to get back to its baseline capacity.,176,,
805,0.97,8555.813,8568.893,"This proposal however, what it is proposing is an expansion of the capacity from the baseline.",176,,
806,0.97,8568.893,8584.442,And I would like to have an opportunity to have a conversation with the sponsor and with city auditor Jones on whether the proposed increase and capacity as proposed is one they can be Operationalized and realized in terms of scale of the proposal.,176,,
807,0.97,8584.442,8623.181,"And whether or not there will be other revenue neutral ways to address the capacity concerns that have been put on the table via this amendment by Councilmember Lewis including Prioritization of other parts of the auditor's work plan, proposed Workplan which gets presented . that might allow for the capacity issues to be addressed in a revenue neutral manner and Reserve general fund dollars for other potential consul priorities.",176,,
808,0.97,8623.181,8641.699,I did want to note the early Toughts from my perspective for the record and for the benefit of the budget chair has a lot of difficult and challenging decisions to make in rebalancing and presenting a new Balanced-Budget.,176,,
809,0.97,8641.699,8649.974,Thank you for that context.,177,,
810,0.97,8649.974,8654.946,I support this amendment.,178,,
811,0.97,8654.946,8665.656,I think we need to grow the city auditor's office . One reason is there is a growing body of work such as the surveillance ordinance.,178,,
812,0.97,8665.656,8668.326,There are things that the auditor has to review.,178,,
813,0.97,8668.326,8672.296,The surveillance Technologies that we are proving.,178,,
814,0.97,8672.296,8679.637,The legacy ones will have to get an annual review on the auditor and that body of work is growing.,178,,
815,0.97,8679.637,8682.707,We have seen some very successful Audits lately.,178,,
816,0.97,8682.707,8708.332,Seattle city light audit that was done and the bridge audit that was done as it was well received . I think it will be beneficial to have the city auditor have that additional bandwidth . I know several of us have thought of things we needed to look further into requiring an audit.,178,,
817,0.97,8708.332,8709.233,We are told there was not the capacity.,178,,
818,0.97,8709.233,8712.937,"If there's a way to address the capacity issue, that would be the ultimate goal.",178,,
819,0.97,8712.937,8718.843,And it does seem like it will take additional Ftes to do that.,178,,
820,0.97,8718.843,8722.747,Thank you very much.,179,,
821,0.97,8722.747,8727.085,Any additional comments?,179,,

825,0.97,8744.168,8766.591,"Before turning it over to cover, I will discuss this walk on amendment which would add $248,000 from the retirement fund to the Seattle retirement system.",180,,
826,0.97,8766.591,8785.643,The board approved adding these positions to deal with workload issues . The indicated year-end supplemental legislation proposed during the process would add the positions.,180,,
827,0.97,8785.643,8790.715,This walk on amendment would add the funding authority.,180,,
828,0.97,8790.715,8791.048,Thank you.,181,,
829,0.97,8791.048,8795.253,I appreciate that.,181,,

831,0.97,8804.562,8814.071,Was not present at the last meeting but there was a vote to request the ability to add these pockets.,181,,
832,0.97,8814.071,8822.814,This is funding that comes from the Seattle city employee retirement system allotment . It has no impact on the general fund.,181,,
833,0.97,8822.814,8834.692,Also have heard from members to represent members that they are supportive of making sure there is sufficient staff to address the needs and capacity.,181,,
834,0.97,8834.692,8856.714,There is a new system we are trying to maintain a level of services we have had over the past few years and make sure we are making headway.,181,,
835,0.97,8856.714,8861.552,We have seen an increase in retirement service requests.,181,,

841,0.97,8943.2,8945.503,I think we are ready to move on to the next item.,181,,
842,0.97,8945.503,8949.974,Could you read item 7 into the record.,181,,
843,0.97,8949.974,8973.164,This is the beginning of the second Subcategory.,182,,
844,0.97,8977.301,9001.258,"I would NOTE this utility section will cover information technology, public utilities and city light . After I discuss these, we will have walk on to present.",183,,
845,0.97,9001.258,9012.269,"Moving to the first published item . would add $697,000 to the it Department for a Digital navigators program.",183,,
846,0.97,9012.269,9023.447,They would be community members with cultural competence and technical knowledge to assist with the use of computers and devices and other services.,183,,
847,0.97,9023.447,9033.691,Sponsored --,183,,
848,0.97,9034.859,9035.393,Councilmember Pedersen.,184,,
849,0.97,9035.393,9039.764,Thank you for the introduction.,185,,
850,0.97,9039.764,9069.827,In 2020 we unanimously approved this to accelerate our pursuit of universal access to and adoption of affordable and reliable Internet services . The Digital divide was laid bare going to hundred . The budget proposal from the executive needs more for Digital equity.,185,,
851,0.97,9069.827,9086.844,I have four commitments that together would enable us to honor the resolution and push ahead with Internet for all and consider it as a Four-Legged stool needed to support Internet for all.,185,,
852,0.97,9086.844,9091.048,"The first is the amendment a Digital navigator program to help those new to the Internet including immigrant families, seniors, low income residents and others who benefit from technical assistance.",185,,
853,0.97,9091.048,9099.857,Second is maintaining the recent increase in the technology matching fund.,185,,
854,0.97,9099.857,9102.226,There will be Wi-Fi Hotspots for libraries.,185,,
855,0.97,9102.226,9104.428,That is in the library discussion later.,185,,
856,0.97,9104.428,9112.77,"And a basic reliable, so we can track the progress of Internet for all.",185,,
857,0.97,9112.77,9129.086,This budget amendment creates the Digital navigator program to help those who need technical assistance to access and use the Internet for vital services.,185,,
858,0.97,9129.086,9130.488,Thank you.,185,,
859,0.97,9130.488,9134.692,Are there any additional comments or questions.,186,,
860,0.97,9134.692,9153.177,We did do you work last year that you noted in the document to increase Digital navigators.,187,,
861,0.97,9153.177,9166.69,Can you confirm how this is different or how this would be additive to what we did last year and whether or not we have any Intel on the central staff side about what that the dollars went out as we directed in the wake of Covid.,187,,
862,0.97,9166.69,9181.138,As I understand it because of the one time Federal money we were able to look at the technology matching fund . and expand the number of organizations that received funding.,188,,
863,0.97,9181.138,9185.109,I think 55 applicants . They had only funded 15.,188,,
864,0.97,9185.109,9191.248,We were able to fund an additional 14. of those applicants.,188,,
865,0.97,9191.248,9196.22,Do have an amendment for the technology matching fund.,188,,
866,0.97,9196.22,9204.261,Some of the Nonprofits will provide similar types of assistance.,188,,
867,0.97,9204.261,9209.066,Digital navigator program is now a national best practice to provide technical assistance.,188,,
868,0.97,9209.066,9215.873,So it would be standing up that program so we can actually move the needle on Internet for all instead of treading water.,188,,
869,0.97,9215.873,9220.177,Thank you very much.,189,,
870,0.97,9220.177,9236.126,I am not see any additional hands.,189,,
871,0.97,9239.463,9244.802,"Would add $300,000 to the information technology Department for the technology matching fund.",190,,
872,0.97,9244.802,9255.212,"This was started in 1997 to support community driven solutions to achieving Digital equity and provide competitive grants of up to $25,000 to qualifying organizations.",190,,
873,0.97,9255.212,9259.883,Grant recipients provide a match of cash.,190,,
874,0.97,9259.883,9271.128,"The proposed budget includes $320,000.",190,,
875,0.97,9276.0,9278.936,Colleagues.,191,,
876,0.97,9278.936,9290.614,This is the technology matching Fund and it is a proven successful program that traditionally the number of applications far exceed the dollars available.,191,,
877,0.97,9290.614,9295.152,To increase access and adoption of Internet services we have to double down on this.,191,,
878,0.97,9295.152,9298.622,We did last fall.,191,,
879,0.97,9298.622,9300.524,", we did earlier this year.",191,,
880,0.97,9300.524,9308.332,But that is not going to extend into next year unless we do something about it.,191,,
881,0.97,9308.332,9317.074,We want to continue to provide the same level in 2022. we need to increase the funding for the technology matching fund.,191,,
882,0.97,9317.074,9324.682,We had 55 applications earlier this year and we are able to fund 15 and we doubled that to 30.,191,,
883,0.97,9324.682,9333.223,This would enable us to have approximately 30 going forward that are funded.,191,,
884,0.97,9333.223,9352.509,So we don't recede or Backtrack on this we are trying to get the last 10% of the city access and even a greater percent to adopt and use the Internet in a safe and effective manner.,191,,
885,0.97,9352.509,9359.083,I need a little more clarification on how this item and the other item are related.,192,,
886,0.97,9359.083,9363.921,Do they go together or can they be Decoupled?,192,,
887,0.97,9363.921,9384.808,The first question I asked it sounded like we needed to have this because we had so much of a need but we cannot fulfill that need for the Digital navigators.,192,,
888,0.97,9393.016,9414.772,They might be immigrant families or seniors low income residents who have access or cut have access but have not gotten the service and don't how to use it so this did little navigator program is a trusted group of key members to are able to make that happen.,193,,
889,0.97,9414.772,9421.545,The technology matching fund is a broader fund addressing Digital divide problems.,193,,
890,0.97,9421.545,9431.088,And it is left up to the groups to decide how to do it.,193,,
891,0.97,9431.088,9450.207,Digital navigators is one type of meeting the Digital equity divide.,194,,
892,0.97,9450.207,9457.514,There were 55 applications and 15 of those were matched.,194,,
893,0.97,9457.514,9468.125,Because there was not enough money.,194,,
894,0.97,9468.125,9476.133,Let's move on to.,195,,
895,0.97,9476.133,9494.117,This is a statement of legislative intent asking for an expenditures report on Internet for all and Digital equity in the 2022 adopted budget.,196,,
896,0.97,9505.028,9515.172,The budget document is sometimes not set up to do that very well.,197,,
897,0.97,9515.172,9539.096,"We were having, even though we have the Internet for all resolution we have an action plan we have strategies to have affordable and reliable Internet service . When you look at the budget it is absent or scattered in different places.",197,,
898,0.97,9549.873,9551.008,When they propose the budget next year they do the same.,197,,
899,0.97,9551.008,9557.781,So we can see the Year-Over- year investments.,197,,
900,0.97,9557.781,9565.289,With this budget document it States the values are important to bring it together.,197,,
901,0.97,9565.289,9578.669,So we can see whether we are doing enough fiscally to close the Digital divide.,197,,
902,0.97,9580.304,9581.772,We have not done anything like this in the past?,198,,
903,0.97,9581.772,9591.214,Last year we had to tell the executive to put Internet for all in the budget so the public knew we had past it and it was part of the ongoing budget.,199,,
904,0.97,9591.214,9603.26,Some of us were surprised . put it in again.,199,,
905,0.97,9603.26,9604.227,Because this is important.,199,,
906,0.97,9604.227,9614.471,Thank you.,200,,
907,0.97,9614.471,9624.881,There is a walk on.,201,,
908,0.97,9632.055,9635.892,We have a walk on amendment.,201,,
909,0.97,9635.892,9637.194,Please go ahead.,201,,
910,0.97,9637.194,9643.767,Just for the record . I am on the central staff.,202,,
911,0.97,9643.767,9654.177,"The effect of this amendment, $1.3 million of General funds to the Seattle information technology Department or Cyber security enhancements.",202,,

913,0.97,9659.316,9669.926,This is an inadvertent omission that a cosponsor--thank you for your noting of that.,202,,
914,0.97,9669.926,9673.23,It would be into pieces.,202,,
915,0.97,9673.23,9675.332,"$850,00 for one time spending.",202,,
916,0.97,9675.332,9679.136,In 2022.,202,,
917,0.97,9679.136,9692.482,"And four and $55,000 of ongoing spending beginning in 2022 of the one time spending in 2022, General fund $300,000 would affect one of the programs, one of the projects within itd.",202,,
918,0.97,9707.998,9721.545,I think we all share the concern I want to make sure that all our systems are protected.,203,,
919,0.97,9721.545,9745.168,The good news is we have a very good strong Seattle information technology Department.,203,,
920,0.97,9750.774,9780.837,This would enhance Cyber security for the city of Seattle and it does it by moving forward in a more rapid fashion with some of the best practices including Multifactor authentication and helping our vendors with basically helping them with their Cyber security as well because there is a lot of financial risk and transactions we want to make sure that our vendors have what they need.,203,,
921,0.97,9780.837,9806.73,We are also what is common for other jurisdictions and large corporations is to hire companies to sort of test the system from the outside and find out whether there are any weaknesses.,203,,
922,0.97,9806.73,9853.009,"We don't know of any weaknesses right now, we just want to step up our game because we know that those who are doing the Cyber attacks and becoming increasingly sophisticated helps us to accelerate that and we also have we have the responsibility to make sure electricity is not interrupted, clean water and are up did and so, you know, we all want to look back on 2021 and think we could've done something better for Cyber security and we want to do everything we can and that is what this amendment is trying to do.",203,,
923,0.97,9853.009,9854.077,Thank you.,203,,
924,0.97,9854.077,9854.711,Thank you.,204,,
925,0.97,9854.711,9863.72,"If you haven't had a chance to read it, now is a good time to ask the Council any additional questions you might have.",204,,

930,0.97,9894.084,9910.166,"Wonderful thank you, we are going to take a Recess in about 43 minutes so thank you for your work today to get us into discussion and also being cautious about the time restraints that we have.",204,,
931,0.97,9910.166,9915.238,Madame clerk appreciate your work today and I will do a quick reminder as we are getting closer to that 1:00 our.,204,,

934,0.97,9926.349,9936.226,"This would add $125,000 of General fund to public Seattle utilities to provide additional cleanup services for things like garbage and graffiti in the Chinatown International district.",204,,
935,0.97,9936.226,9945.902,The sponsor for this item is Mireles and sponsored by two Councilman.,204,,
936,0.97,9945.902,9949.873,Anything to add?,205,,
937,0.97,9949.873,9960.383,"Hi, everyone, sorry, yes, briefly the intent here is to provide some more support to the Chinatown International district.",206,,
938,0.97,9960.383,9965.388,That is the area of town with the densest restaurant district actually in state.,206,,
939,0.97,9965.388,9974.931,The largest amount of low income business and property owners as well as the largest concentration of low income residents in the city.,206,,
940,0.97,9974.931,9990.58,"We do have the cities clear program which provides, you know, safe rallies and provides for trash pickup but the way that it is structured right now it creates an undue financial burden on the businesses and residents.",206,,
941,0.97,9990.58,10022.278,"They are expected to pay a monthly fee for cleanup for trash pickup plus when we are talking about the high volume of restaurant service in the neighborhood, the high concentration of low income business owners and property owners and residents, programs like this really don't offer the kind of incentives that are affordable to folks in that neighborhood.",206,,
942,0.97,10022.278,10024.481,They basically can't afford it.,206,,
943,0.97,10024.481,10042.165,"The business improvement area in the neighborhood does provide some support but again because of the economic status of the neighborhood, they aren't really able to generate the kind of revenue that they need to keep pace with the support for trash pickup that the neighborhood needs.",206,,
944,0.97,10042.165,10050.073,"And so, we are requesting or submitting this amendment to provide additional cleanup service.",206,,
945,0.97,10050.073,10063.086,"The request was for $350,000 over a two-year period and so we are submitting the amendment for half of that amount for the first year.",206,,
946,0.97,10063.086,10070.627,Thing that I want to think the Councilmember for already indicating she would like to be added as a cosponsor.,206,,
947,0.97,10070.627,10081.07,Any additional comments?,206,,
948,0.97,10100.323,10111.868,And where does sort of the opportunity come in to try to both bring private investment along at the same time?,206,,
949,0.97,10111.868,10165.121,"I will take a stab at it and they might be able to provide more information but as you know the supplement is not able to be the resource for regular trash pickup and so for this program, they are able to support some pickup here because we have the different business improvement areas across the city have widely different revenue and bottom lines and very tremendously and how they are able to support their different business neighborhood districts and it is just the case for the Chinatown International district that though there exists, their annual revenues are, you know, relatively small compared to the downtown for example.",207,,
950,0.97,10165.121,10175.498,"And so they do provide some support, but it is not, they are just not able to provide the kind of support that is needed in order to keep pace with the trash pickup that is needed in this neighborhood.",207,,
951,0.97,10175.498,10194.984,"Particularly given, you know, the high amount of food waste and trash that is generated by them.",207,,
952,0.97,10196.219,10197.253,"Okay, let's move on.",208,,
953,0.97,10197.253,10200.957,The next item in here is SP 002.,208,,

959,0.97,10229.085,10240.797,This is the second of three budget actions related to second chance as mentioned earlier and it is connected to the item that we discussed further up in the agenda for a sewer line connection.,212,,
960,0.97,10240.797,10273.529,This funding would Reserve resources to ensure that the mobile hygiene trailer that they are purchasing or access to the mobile hygiene trailer will be available at the site in recognition that understanding from Spu that it's mobile hygiene's trailer will be intended to rotate among locations just merely ensures that it is one of those locations.,212,,
961,0.97,10273.529,10273.93,Thank you.,212,,
962,0.97,10273.93,10278.935,Thank you very much.,213,,

968,0.97,10315.838,10338.895,"With the 21 hygiene stations and two hygiene trailers that are intended to be funded in the baseline budget, can you remind us overall how many of our section Encampments are going to be able to receive additional support and where there may still be a gap in services that we are trying to shore up?",214,,
969,0.97,10338.895,10343.7,"Things specifically, you know, for camp second chance we want to make sure that there is the ongoing services at the centers.",214,,
970,0.97,10343.7,10368.024,How many other locations are intended to be served and if there are folks that will be left out of the existing baseline adjustment in the proposed budget.,214,,
971,0.97,10395.618,10398.388,This would request that camp second chance be one of those fights.,215,,
972,0.97,10398.388,10408.765,I don't have information about how many total sites there are but I couldn't tell many how many is being served.,215,,
973,0.97,10408.765,10409.866,Thank you very much.,216,,

979,0.97,10430.153,10449.172,This counsel budget action would add $1.4 million of General fund to Spu to provide additional wastewater and cleanup services for recreational vehicles and they would have the chance to direct these in the wastewater program distribution and additional track pickup services.,219,,
980,0.97,10449.172,10456.312,It is cosponsored by Mireles and Lewis.,219,,

983,0.97,10461.784,10498.221,This is one of the two amendments which means half of the Unhallowed people in Seattle and this budget budget amendment would increase funding for garbage collection for all of the Rvs and other vehicle that they are now relying on for shelter in the context of not only the recent pandemic and economic places but the ongoing and ever exacerbating housing Affordability crisis.,221,,
984,0.97,10498.221,10516.372,This will improve the lives of residents by providing access to the basic sanitation services and it also would improve the lives of the House neighbors cleaned up across their neighborhood.,221,,
985,0.97,10516.372,10587.643,And in fact this is something that they are in strong agreement of as well as there are people being forced to leave in their vehicles because of the housing Affordability crisis and be sure to have these basic services provided to our residents and as I mentioned the other establishes three safe parking lots of adopted and these would have to $6 million for the campaign this year thank you.,221,,
986,0.97,10587.643,10598.054,Thank you very much.,222,,
987,0.97,10605.928,10606.262,All right.,222,,

992,0.97,10617.64,10632.355,This is a statement of legislative intent that would request that Spu Incoordination with the Department of transportation perform an assessment of potential drainage options between North 125th Street and North 130Th street.,223,,
993,0.97,10632.355,10645.768,"Request that Spu provide a record report to the committee or the successor committee by June 21st, 2022.",223,,
994,0.97,10645.768,10656.312,"Thank you, please go ahead.",224,,
995,0.97,10659.482,10690.146,"Let me tell you, this issue with community members approaching my office has been going on well before I was elected in 2016 concerning the flooding that occurs on the street and flooding in basements and risky behavior for children the street like many in district 5 and up North have no sidewalks and children frequently walk in the middle of the road to avoid puddles that form on the borders.",225,,
996,0.97,10690.146,10707.73,So we see this a lot up in the North end so what we are seeing as we want our children and our neighbors to be able to safely walk in their neighborhood without the fear of being hit by a car which as you know they have the highest pedestrian rate of deaths.,225,,
997,0.97,10707.73,10724.046,"So, again, this is a safety issue that has been going on forever that affects obviously disabled folks, Elders and as you would say, chair, and Madam chair, Kiddos.",225,,
998,0.97,10724.046,10742.865,"And so, we would like the slide to request that Spu and Estar come together to create an action plan for moving forward to provide us with options and work with the Stakeholders to communicate the results of the assessment.",225,,
999,0.97,10742.865,10771.961,"I should say, though, and thank you Spu and Sdot that they have always been great ongoing work outside of the budget cycle process but I think we are finally gaining some momentum if you will, to actually getting more targeted areas that are more high- traffic and as you know those are around light rail stations that will be around schools, that will be around community centers, grocery stores and so that is what we are asking for here.",225,,
1000,0.97,10771.961,10773.596,"So, that is all I've got for you.",225,,

1007,0.97,10788.144,10789.411,Did I hear that correctly?,226,,
1008,0.97,10789.411,10789.812,Yes.,227,,

1024,0.97,10876.699,10887.643,This request comes from my regularly scheduled district office hours with where we had a request for increased lighting for safety measures in the alleyways.,234,,
1025,0.97,10887.643,10908.964,"This led to us doing a walking tour of the entire neighborhood to assess what areas would need additional lighting and through this process I worked with Steve Haynes from my office in the dark, I took them up unimproved alleyways, pill, through the dark.",234,,
1026,0.97,10908.964,10913.869,I just want to thank everyone for going on that walk with me.,234,,
1027,0.97,10913.869,10942.464,"What we found, as I try to refrain from the long old history of being its own city and how Fremont was developed, what we have here is two different plots that were developed in a street that does not have any Streetlights so, as Eric noted for the record is that we can't use funds to put Streetlights on the street.",234,,
1028,0.97,10942.464,10946.402,It is a very long walk.,234,,
1029,0.97,10946.402,10952.374,It has a good tree canopy and so there is very little light.,234,,
1030,0.97,10952.374,10956.679,When we did our walking tour as city employees we had to use our flashlights just to navigate the street.,234,,
1031,0.97,10956.679,10974.563,And so that is why I you bringing this amendment here because we need to have the general fund hours pay for this improvement so that I guess I won't jump but that we will also then be spending our general fund dollars on the electrical activation of these lights.,234,,
1032,0.97,10974.563,10990.512,We have the neighbors around this and have done extensive outreach to everyone on the block and there is wide consensus that this is a desired improvement that they would like to see.,234,,
1033,0.97,10990.512,10995.15,So thank you to the neighbors of 40th Street and thank you colleagues for considering this request.,234,,

1041,0.97,11066.822,11078.901,There are a number of places that they could add Streetlights themselves but this request to bring Streetlights to a street that does not have them and requires a flashlight to navigate in the dark needs our support here today.,235,,

1071,0.97,11290.846,11349.471,"However, there are two libraries that are newer and are not part of that plan it was very well served not just because of the absence of the cooling system of this library associated with our geographic distance from the location of many cooling centers to the city but also because of the bridge being down.",245,,
1072,0.97,11349.471,11374.896,"Even when the bridge is up and functioning it is a challenge for district 1 folks on the peninsula to access emergency shelter whether or not you're talking about the response in the wintertime were cooling centers and heat waves so, really appreciate the attention to this need.",245,,

1127,0.97,11754.342,11764.052,"If you recall the John Lewis bridge, it lands right, almost right next to the Childcare facility and that was by design.",260,,
1128,0.97,11764.052,11776.898,Originally the bridge was supposed to be at the South end of the campus but we felt that the North and was better and would provide more access where people could drop the children off at the Childcare.,260,,
1129,0.97,11776.898,11783.538,And use the Childcare to cover the cost of the bridge to be employed at the Northgate Plaza or the Northgate area.,260,,
1130,0.97,11783.538,11789.043,"So, anyway, we would love to see the school back up and running as soon as possible.",260,,

1137,0.97,11828.683,11835.456,And know that you worked on helping to get funding secured for that bridge throughout four Marisol thank you for the work there.,261,,
1138,0.97,11835.456,11860.815,"You have taken it from sound like it was a dark tunnel that was not accessible and because of the work that you and counsel did to expand the vision really actually made it an accessible, Walkable and beautiful bridge dedicated to John Lewis so I just want to highlight that history and thank you for your work.",261,,
1139,0.97,11860.815,11883.271,"I want to and if you don't mind, just briefly, this is the work of this Council and the Council before and like you said four years including yourself, Council President Gonzales have always been supportive of this bridge and widening it and making it more accessible for Strollers and Moms in Wheelchairs and students.",262,,
1140,0.97,11883.271,11904.058,"So, you know, as you all know, I can't, I can't take credit, but it is mainly been the legislative body and the goodwill of the last four years that had made clear that the city of Seattle would contribute through Sdot.",262,,
1141,0.97,11904.058,11905.827,It would make it a more accessible bridge.,262,,
1142,0.97,11905.827,11915.236,So my things and my hands up to my colleagues and to the last four years.,262,,
1143,0.97,11915.236,11915.837,So thank you.,262,,

1145,0.97,11917.338,11918.64,Appreciate it and appreciate your leadership.,263,,
1146,0.97,11918.64,11928.85,We did it.,263,,
1147,0.97,11933.154,11940.194,Next item is deal 4 A1.,263,,
1148,0.97,11940.194,11951.606,To assist Seattle public schools with improving bus writing technology including the purchase of the buses.,263,,

1150,0.97,11955.843,11961.516,"Thank you, please go ahead.",264,,
1151,0.97,11961.516,11969.057,This is a request from our school traffic safety committee which is surprised of school district staff and community leaders concerned with pedestrian safety.,265,,
1152,0.97,11969.057,11976.531,It is also a request from several school board members and it will be welcomed by Seattle public schools.,265,,
1153,0.97,11976.531,11986.908,"This amendment provides a one- time capital investment to enable Seattle public schools to address the school bus crisis by using technology to help bus drivers, parents and the school district.",265,,
1154,0.97,11986.908,11995.95,"The technology includes routing, transportation software and tablets on each bus but that would be owned by the school district.",265,,
1155,0.97,11995.95,12003.057,This would make it much easier for bus drivers to staff and understand the revised routes that they have to get kids to where they need to go on time.,265,,
1156,0.97,12003.057,12013.167,Currently they are printed on paper.,265,,
1157,0.97,12013.167,12018.439,Parents are left wondering when their children will arrive.,265,,
1158,0.97,12018.439,12029.684,And then students are constituents too and this is a way that we can provide one- time funding to help Seattle public schools with an immediate need.,265,,
1159,0.97,12029.684,12030.084,Thank you.,265,,
1160,0.97,12030.084,12036.791,Thank you very much Councilmember Pedersen.,266,,
1161,0.97,12036.791,12065.787,I want to thank you and the members of the school board for the work you've done to identify this issue last year and know we continue to receive concerns and calls from school board members were very concerned about the cities and helping provide housing services for those who are Un- sheltered and on your school property and that very much felt like it was their responsibility to be a better partner there and again I think it is Lamentable that we want the school board members at that time.,266,,
1162,0.97,12065.787,12075.496,And I'm wondering what the rule is for the state Legislature to help provide the technology needed for the school buses.,266,,
1163,0.97,12075.496,12081.135,It sounds like this is something rather than using regular Gps tracking.,266,,
1164,0.97,12081.135,12094.015,Also could you tell me about the school board or the state Legislature and that they might have on this.,266,,
1165,0.97,12094.015,12116.337,"Well, the school district, we were reading about this crisis right now and the paper and I think that the school board's budgetary options are as we are in the middle of our budget process now and we have multiple sources of funds.",267,,
1166,0.97,12116.337,12129.75,"And they are able to help support schools, public schools, so this is just a one- time capital funding that we've been asked about to support again the school district would own this equipment.",267,,
1167,0.97,12129.75,12136.657,But the problem right now is bus drivers are printing it out on paper and it is what is contributing to the crisis.,267,,
1168,0.97,12136.657,12145.066,Thank you very much.,268,,
1169,0.97,12145.066,12146.2,That was a mistake.,269,,
1170,0.97,12146.2,12146.601,My apologies.,269,,
1171,0.97,12146.601,12147.268,No problem.,270,,
1172,0.97,12147.268,12150.338,[Laughter] thank you very much.,270,,
1173,0.97,12150.338,12150.905,"Councilmember, go ahead.",270,,
1174,0.97,12150.905,12154.609,Thank you.,271,,
1175,0.97,12154.609,12161.182,Just so happened I met with some of these folks yesterday during my district 6 office hours.,271,,
1176,0.97,12161.182,12178.399,"We've got a number of district 6 residents on the school safety Commission here, so, just looking at my notes, I want to highlight a couple of things that I heard yesterday, which is that as we know the state Legislature provides a bucket of General funding for transportation.",271,,
1177,0.97,12178.399,12191.045,That does not necessarily include the requirements for transporting students who are experiencing homelessness or home instability to and from their schools.,271,,
1178,0.97,12191.045,12205.526,"As we know if a student is enrolled at a school, the school district is still responsible for getting that student to their Seattle public school.",271,,
1179,0.97,12205.526,12229.784,"Granted, this is, and I told them yesterday, this is squarely, the state Legislature needs to promise and as we know from that, and Luckily I Unblinking on the name of the lawsuit at this point because we've gotten far enough away from it, but we do know that the state is not funding the school district at the rate that it should be.",271,,
1180,0.97,12229.784,12270.791,"When I push back on the conversation last night, you know, I suggested that this is included in that contract so that as technology changes, it is not, we don't need to come back to this conversation and it does seem that this is a need that is needed today, because again, you can't just take a phone and plug in the Gps route for the bus route on your phone because of the length and the difficulty of navigating school buses through ridges gentle streets.",271,,
1181,0.97,12270.791,12275.997,So the case was made to me even after I pushed back Yesterda and I support this as well.,271,,
1182,0.97,12275.997,12276.397,Thank you.,271,,
1183,0.97,12276.397,12282.937,Thank you very much.,272,,
1184,0.97,12282.937,12293.914,I just wanted to add a little context here and perhaps some nuance.,273,,
1185,0.97,12293.914,12298.519,I am listed as a cosponsor of this item I did continue to support it.,273,,
1186,0.97,12298.519,12326.781,I will say that I see this as a stopgap measure to the realities around the ongoing transportation difficulties related to how SPs meets the needs of Transportation for those children in Seattle public schools who continue to rely on the Busing system to get to and from school and is in class every single day.,273,,
1187,0.97,12326.781,12358.479,"I want to flag that in my conversations with Councilmember Pedersen when we Alked about this particular item, I was very transparent in my concerns that I think that the way that SPs is continuing to manage transportation needs of students is unsustainable and that the city of Seattle Hould not be continuously put in the position of being the Backfill or the safety net for addressing many of those systemic concerns.",273,,
1188,0.97,12358.479,12429.183,"Now, that being said, again, getting back to the need to address the realities of our constituents abilities to get to and from school, they don't get to vote, but they are still our constituents, it is really important and so I do think that while we continue to work with our partners on the school board, while we continue to work with the administration over at the Seattle public schools on those long-term issues related to transportation in the school system, I do make it is important to provide this technology as a way to create some greater efficiency within the bus system that will hopefully yield some positive results in being able to in the context of having less bus drivers to really sort of get more kids to and from schools and I know that all of us here from parents within the public school system are talking about how buses sometimes just don't show up.",273,,
1189,0.97,12429.183,12455.176,"Sometimes they are an hour to two hours late and so I think that this technology investment could help create some efficiency is, again, while we have a good partner work with Seattle public schools on addressing the longer-term structural issues that frankly have continued to worsen year after year after year and so I think it behooves us to build strong partnership there and to work towards a long-term solution.",273,,
1190,0.97,12455.176,12465.186,So I just wanted to offer that up as the chair and other members think about this particular potential investment.,273,,
1191,0.97,12465.186,12472.827,"Ray, thank you very much.",274,,
1192,0.97,12472.827,12479.066,I think that was a good example of sort of the dialogue and questions Back-And-Forth that we love to hear on some of these amendments as we go forth.,274,,
1193,0.97,12479.066,12483.137,We will take one more item here to close out Deel and then we will go to our Recess.,274,,
1194,0.97,12483.137,12484.438,Thank you for the discussion.,274,,
1195,0.97,12484.438,12505.159,"The last item is five A1 on this Council budget item without $450,000 of General funds to supplement funding for a restorative justice pilot program in schools.",275,,
1196,0.97,12521.442,12560.114,"Greeted fun this last year for a partnership with Seattle public schools and with Community-Based organizations to really sort of build out restorative practices it would allow us to increase and the number of organizations who can produce debate in the pilot so as a city, we can learn from a few different environments and learn as much as possible about how to find and implement these kinds of changes citywide.",276,,
1197,0.97,12560.114,12562.483,Thank you.,277,,
1198,0.97,12562.483,12570.124,Any additional questions?,277,,
1199,0.97,12570.124,12578.799,"Is this bringing to scale some of the existing services if we are already providing a $550,000 from support from last year?",277,,
1200,0.97,12578.799,12625.479,"This pilot allows us to work with I think two schools in the hope is that we would be able to start working with additional schools as I mentioned when we talked about this last year, there is a lot of like practices in place in some schools but what this really is getting at is how we change culture within the administration, within the staff, so it isn't just about teaching the kids and it exists within the at Ministration of the schools and so the hope is that we can expand that word into more than just one or two high schools in the area.",278,,
