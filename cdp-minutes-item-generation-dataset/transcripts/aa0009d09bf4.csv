366,0.97,1849.314,1856.02,It would place this county lot under the jurisdiction of our endangered species act program.,114,,
367,0.97,1856.02,1858.423,The lot is adjacent to other conservation parcels that city light owns.,114,,
368,0.97,1858.423,1866.631,It will help city light to restore this parcel to continue the restoration that we are doing in this area.,114,,
369,0.97,1866.631,1877.742,"Restoration essentially would entail treating some Invasive species on the property, most notably blackberry, and also replanting it.",114,,
370,0.97,1877.742,1887.652,"This is something that, mostly replanting it with Conifers, which are more beneficial to salmon and other wildlife.",114,,
371,0.97,1887.652,1889.287,That is the funding that we currently have.,114,,
372,0.97,1889.287,1895.426,"Next slide, please.",114,,
373,0.97,1895.426,1910.241,"Just to give you a little background on the endangered species act program, he began in 2000 with the listing at the Federal level of certain salmon and Trout . It focuses on acquiring habitat beneficial for fish in multiple watersheds.",114,,
374,0.97,1910.241,1915.88,Part of this is mitigation for the Esa incidental take statement for the current license.,114,,
375,0.97,1915.88,1924.722,"Currently, it is about 3700 acres are purchased and protected right now.",114,,
376,0.97,1924.722,1935.8,"Since 2000, we have spent $5.9 million in city light funds and $5.2 million in grant funds specifically in the watershed under this program.",114,,
377,0.97,1935.8,1938.269,Next slide.,114,,
378,0.97,1938.269,1956.921,"This is to show overall the acquisitions that we have done in the area under city light's program, with a highlighted square with the parcel number being the lot that we are accepting from Skagit County.",114,,
379,0.97,1956.921,1965.496,The green shows properties purchased under the wildlife lands under the current license and the Red shows properties purchased under the Esa program.,114,,
380,0.97,1965.496,1967.899,That is what I have to present to Council.,114,,
381,0.97,1967.899,1970.935,Any questions?,114,,
382,0.97,1970.935,1973.838,Thank you very much.,115,,

386,0.97,1991.322,2005.103,If you could bring up the Powerpoint again to the map of all of the parcels?,116,,
387,0.97,2005.737,2012.377,"You briefly touched on this, Denise, and maybe you can expand on it a little bit more, the difference between the dollars that we spend for the Licensure agreement and the endangered species act.",116,,
388,0.97,2012.377,2024.389,"The last time we brought a transfer like this to the committee, it was in regards to the Licensure agreement and the final purchase to meet our Licensure needs.",116,,
389,0.97,2024.389,2025.59,This is different.,116,,
390,0.97,2025.59,2035.166,Can you explain the difference between the endangered species act dollar grants and the dollars that we have to spend to meet our Licensure agreements?,116,,
391,0.97,2035.166,2035.566,Certainly.,117,,
392,0.97,2035.566,2055.086,"The essay lands program--Esa lands program formed when the current license that the Skagit is under, those were not listed under the endangered species act.",117,,
393,0.97,2055.086,2067.231,This program was put in effect to essentially have the city do its part to help do salmon recovery in the watersheds that we were hoping to impact.,117,,
394,0.97,2067.231,2084.715,"That is how this program came forward and why was of this program is not tied to the license, whereas the parcels shown in green on this slide are tied to the license.",117,,
395,0.97,2084.715,2097.462,"That was part of the agreement when the first license was negotiated, that a certain amount of funds would be set aside for wildlife habitat acquisition.",117,,
396,0.97,2097.462,2098.83,That is what those green funds show.,117,,
397,0.97,2098.83,2111.943,"The benefit of the Esa lands program, since most of it is not tied to mitigation, we are able to apply for grant funds.",117,,
398,0.97,2111.943,2115.379,Most grant funds will not provide funding if something is a requirement for an entity to do.,117,,
399,0.97,2115.379,2126.991,"Since this is what Seattle city light does above and beyond Úrequirements as part of our environmental stewardship, it allows us to apply for those grant funds that way, we are furthering the reach of, expanding the reach of our city light dollars.",117,,
400,0.97,2126.991,2128.192,That is really excellent.,118,,
401,0.97,2128.192,2140.171,"I am sorry, do you know off the top of your head how much grant funding we have available to apply for and how much we currently use?",118,,
402,0.97,2140.171,2145.776,"If you do not have that off the top of your head, we can talk about it off-line.",118,,
403,0.97,2145.776,2155.82,"I can get you more complete numbers, but in the Skagit, I often partner with the Skagit land trust to do acquisitions in the Skagit watershed.",119,,
404,0.97,2155.82,2164.896,"We currently have probably, I think it is around $800,000 under grants that we currently have to acquire properties.",119,,
405,0.97,2164.896,2169.634,And we share that money to acquire properties.,119,,
406,0.97,2169.634,2180.077,"Then we also have a proposal before the Skagit watershed Council to increase that by another $400,000 for another parcel we are trying to acquire.",119,,
407,0.97,2180.077,2185.85,So that is great.,119,,
408,0.97,2185.85,2186.851,I want to highlight the reason.,119,,
409,0.97,2186.851,2191.656,"This grant funding, this program allows city light to go above and beyond its Licensure agreements.",119,,
410,0.97,2191.656,2192.356,Just really great work.,119,,
411,0.97,2192.356,2201.532,"I have to give credit where credit is due . for my next question, Kate prompted me during our Pre-Committee briefing.",119,,
412,0.97,2201.532,2207.171,Can you share with us how Covid has impacted your purchasing in this area?,119,,
413,0.97,2207.171,2207.838,Yes.,120,,
414,0.97,2207.838,2218.382,"In the last grant round, we had a property that we had reached a verbal agreement with the seller to purchase.",120,,
415,0.97,2218.382,2241.839,"As we were going through the grant process and I was reaching out to the Landowner to say, Hey, here is the draft purchase agreement and we would like you to sign it now that we have this verbal agreement, I was having a hard time reaching him.",120,,
416,0.97,2241.839,2248.613,I got a hold of him and he admitted that he was selling the property to a couple was paying well above and beyond appraised value in a realm that we could never match.,120,,
417,0.97,2248.613,2260.825,"That is just part of my reality, what people are calling essentially urban flight from Covid to get to more rural areas where people are for receiving the opportunity to get away from Covid.",120,,
418,0.97,2260.825,2262.893,They perceive it is safer.,120,,
419,0.97,2262.893,2271.636,We have essentially been out bed at extreme levels and not able to acquire some of these key parcels that we really want to get.,120,,
420,0.97,2271.636,2272.803,Keep up the great work.,121,,
421,0.97,2272.803,2286.917,You are doing great I appreciate everyone from the city light team . Thank you.,121,,

602,0.97,3542.972,3548.311,We are not sure yet exactly to what degree that will impact us.,141,,
603,0.97,3548.311,3555.118,"We are also looking at guidelines being issued around capital funds, depending on the Treasury rules.",141,,
604,0.97,3555.118,3559.222,So continuing to monitor that.,141,,

606,0.97,3593.856,3598.695,We could see a proposal that could help public housing authorities seek reimbursement for Internet costs for residents in subsidized housing.,141,,

619,0.97,3690.853,3695.725,That also benefited some of our Community-Based organizations and Bipoc community organizations in Seattle.,141,,
620,0.97,3695.725,3703.032,The emergency Broadband benefit just launched.,141,,
621,0.97,3703.032,3706.669,It is providing a discount for residents for the Internet costs on a very temporary basis.,141,,

623,0.97,3715.445,3716.679,But it is an opportunity.,141,,

We are working closely with our community of partners to build capacity to help them sign up residents.,146,,
677,0.97,4102.565,4107.87,"We will be actively looking for state, Federal, and other funding opportunities.",146,,
678,0.97,4107.87,4113.809,We believe our Internet fraud framework allows us to take advantage of these as they arise.,146,,
679,0.97,4113.809,4129.191,We plan to continue to invest in the community through matching fund grants to upgrade Wi-Fi capabilities in our libraries and community centers and to make headway on developing a community cellular network here in Seattle.,146,,
680,0.97,4129.191,4133.662,These will provide more Connectivity options for our residents.,146,,
681,0.97,4133.662,4136.499,These improvements will also benefit residence now and for years to come.,146,,
682,0.97,4136.499,4140.169,So lots of good things are in the works.,146,,
683,0.97,4140.169,4145.841,"We are excited to share progress on these items through an Online, Internet for all dashboard.",146,,
684,0.97,4145.841,4161.69,This will enable us to provide more real-time updates to share with our Stakeholders and to celebrate successes as they come.,146,,
685,0.97,4161.69,4163.559,That brings us to the end of our presentation.,146,,
686,0.97,4163.559,4168.931,I want to thank everybody in Seattle I.T.,146,,
687,0.97,4168.931,4177.339,Who has been working on these issues regarding the Digital divide before our Internet for all resolution.,146,,
688,0.97,4177.339,4182.211,It has been great to work with you as we developed that resolution and the action plan that you have.,146,,
689,0.97,4182.211,4186.982,"As we know, the Covid pandemic has laid there those Digital inequities.",146,,
690,0.97,4186.982,4191.153,Your work to close the gap is very important.,146,,
691,0.97,4191.153,4199.628,"I know that Seattle I.T., a lot of it is an internal facing Department helping us with our technology infrastructure.",146,,
692,0.97,4199.628,4215.878,"The need externally in our communities is so great for access to the Internet . as the new head of the Federal Communications Commission is saying, access to high-speed Internet is no longer nice to have.",146,,
693,0.97,4215.878,4222.618,"It needs to be had for education, employment, and health services.",146,,
694,0.97,4222.618,4230.559,I am glad to hear you restate our goal of universal adoption of high-speed Internet access.,146,,
695,0.97,4230.559,4250.479,"In reading the report, the update, one of the things that stood out for me is that there have been gains over the last several months as everybody has stepped up at different levels of government like the FCC program that was discussed, if her levels of government but also the private sector providers.",146,,
696,0.97,4250.479,4260.923,Everybody is doing more.,146,,
697,0.97,4272.668,4278.107,We want to make sure that slipping back to fewer ot opportunities and fewer subsidies for lower income households to adopt high-speed Internet access.,146,,
698,0.97,4278.107,4290.686,"As you implement the action plan we all agreed to, please let us know when you need city Council to step in and help with the private sector to make sure they are providing what our low income residents need.",146,,
699,0.97,4290.686,4296.358,The other thing that stood out for me is the dashboard.,146,,
700,0.97,4296.358,4303.065,"As the saying goes, what gets measured gets done.",146,,
701,0.97,4303.065,4315.044,I am very eager to see the dashboard when it is available so we can Recalibrate on how we are tracking toward the ultimate goal of getting universal adoption to high- speed Internet access.,146,,
702,0.97,4315.044,4318.881,We want it to be reliable and affordable.,146,,
703,0.97,4318.881,4323.552,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",146,,
704,0.97,4323.552,4325.788,Thank you very much.,147,,
705,0.97,4325.788,4331.493,I have a question about a slightly different issue around Internet access.,147,,
706,0.97,4331.493,4354.216,"That relates to trying to understand how we can better Incentivize providers through our contracts to make sure that they are building out their Infrastructures in the city, and parts of the city that do not have access to the Internet.",147,,
707,0.97,4354.216,4373.936,"I am creating a term in the contract, but there is one set of issues that relate to city requirements in order to make an area eligible for Broadband access.",147,,
708,0.97,4373.936,4389.618,"The other is, I am not finding it right now, but there is a Nonstandard thing.",147,,
709,0.97,4389.618,4409.671,"I have two examples of households in my district that have been trying for years, literally years, to get Broadband access and have been unable to because of language within our own contracts that make it so providers are not under any obligation to provide service.",147,,
710,0.97,4409.671,4418.247,"If I could speak to that really quickly, one of the things that is really hard to accept, what is the reality of our Federal telecommunications law, is that it is silo do.",148,,
711,0.97,4418.247,4424.753,The authority we have and the contracts you are referring to are over cable television service.,148,,
712,0.97,4424.753,4439.234,We have no authority at the local government or as a state to require a Broadband or Internet service provider to build out and provide that service.,148,,
713,0.97,4439.234,4440.169,There is an overlay there.,148,,
714,0.97,4440.169,4445.407,Our original cable television providers and the infrastructure to provide TV is now a medium over which Internet service is provided.,148,,
715,0.97,4445.407,4462.558,"Now that we have changed to a time when people want just Internet service, we cannot make that kind of requirement.",148,,
716,0.97,4462.558,4464.226,We don't have that authority under federal law.,148,,
717,0.97,4464.226,4464.927,That is one barrier.,148,,
718,0.97,4464.927,4474.636,And then we did change back in 2015 because the vast majority of our city was built out with cable television service in order to Incentivize her competition.,148,,
719,0.97,4474.636,4483.445,"With the investment we got from Centurylink to come to upgrade their system to Fiberoptics in two thirds of the city, we changed our Cable code.",148,,
720,0.97,4483.445,4492.521,We did not require people franchise areas with universal Buildout.,148,,
721,0.97,4492.521,4496.024,We allowed a Cable operator for cable-television purposes to build out any way they wanted in the city.,148,,
722,0.97,4496.024,4500.128,We don't have the authority to tell a Cable operator you have to build to a certain house.,148,,
723,0.97,4500.128,4510.772,That left us with some pop small pockets that did not have Cable TV in years passed and are hard to reach for one reason or another.,148,,
724,0.97,4510.772,4516.945,"Sorry, I did not ask about a requirement.",149,,
725,0.97,4516.945,4520.983,"I question was specifically, how do we Incentivize?",149,,
726,0.97,4520.983,4536.131,"In those cases, general the problem is that it is a very limited amount.",150,,
727,0.97,4539.568,4540.702,It is one house or two.,150,,
728,0.97,4540.702,4545.407,It is so expensive to build out that there is no business case for them the way the city can potentially Incentivize it.,150,,
729,0.97,4545.407,4559.655,"If we can find ways to work with them, this is a conversation we are having at Seattle I.T.",150,,
730,0.97,4561.49,4562.958,It is a return on investment question.,150,,
731,0.97,4562.958,4563.892,It is very expensive.,150,,
732,0.97,4563.892,4566.328,I think advocating for that need is an important step to the process.,150,,
733,0.97,4566.328,4571.9,We have to keep Championing this cause.,150,,
734,0.97,4571.9,4579.107,We can look for ways to amplify that message so that they understand that it is important to the city and our community.,150,,
735,0.97,4579.107,4583.345,"Although that message it may not have as much strength as we want said, I think it does help Incentivize.",150,,
736,0.97,4583.345,4584.012,This is me.,151,,
737,0.97,4584.012,4592.521,I have been advocating for Colin to be able to purchase Broadband Cable service since I took office in 2015.,151,,
738,0.97,4592.521,4606.134,"We have been working with the providers, different providers to try to help him.",151,,
739,0.97,4606.134,4607.135,We have hit a wall.,151,,
740,0.97,4607.135,4608.37,This is me advocating elevating it.,151,,
741,0.97,4608.37,4615.277,We have talked to many people at different providers to try to help him and have really continued to hit walls.,151,,
742,0.97,4615.277,4626.855,"Anything you can do to help me lift his voice and get service, there is another group of families and another part of the district that are facing Úthe same problem.",151,,
743,0.97,4626.855,4627.456,Thank you.,152,,
744,0.97,4627.456,4637.599,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold for raising that.",153,,
745,0.97,4637.599,4640.302,We will not be able to achieve Internet for all unless Everybod has it.,153,,
746,0.97,4640.302,4641.269,I hope the Seattle I.T.,153,,
747,0.97,4641.269,4646.508,Can reach out to Councilmember Herbold's office to Brainstorm on additional strategies to help with that.,153,,
748,0.97,4646.508,4650.212,Perhaps a Wi-Fi Hotspot or something.,153,,
749,0.97,4650.212,4651.179,Councilmember Morales?,153,,
750,0.97,4651.179,4657.719,"Good morning, everyone.",154,,
751,0.97,4657.719,4664.426,I get as frustrated as Councilmember Herbold with his conversation.,154,,
752,0.97,4664.426,4678.24,"It is really difficult for me to understand how we can say at the same time that Internet is a basic utility, and that we cannot function without it in this day and age.",154,,
753,0.97,4678.24,4680.842,School work . cannot do their we cannot make medical appointments.,154,,
754,0.97,4680.842,4683.311,People cannot apply for jobs.,154,,
755,0.97,4683.311,4684.546,People cannot talk to their doctors.,154,,
756,0.97,4684.546,4685.947,It is essential that we have it.,154,,
757,0.97,4685.947,4699.361,"At the same time, we're talking about how if businesses cannot make a business case for why they cannot go to each individual household, there is not much we can do.",154,,
758,0.97,4699.361,4700.862,Those two things are in conflict.,154,,
759,0.97,4700.862,4707.069,"As a local government, our responsibility is to make sure everybody has access to what they need in order to thrive.",154,,
760,0.97,4707.069,4712.174,I expect that we will be hearing again from the folks who have been advocating for invisible Broadband.,154,,
761,0.97,4712.174,4718.88,"This is not sustainable for us to say that if you cannot make the business case, a particular neighborhood does not get a basic utility.",154,,
762,0.97,4718.88,4761.423,"I think we will begin to have a really different kind of conversation in the city about what we mean when we are talking about equity, when you talk about access to resources and to basic utilities so that folks in our communities, particularly in neighborhoods that have been this invested in for generations are able to catch up with the rest of the city to be able to do the things they need to do without having to worry about other somebody can make a business case for it.",154,,
763,0.97,4761.59,4762.724,Thank you for that comment.,155,,
764,0.97,4762.724,4764.025,"Well said, Councilmember Morales.",156,,
765,0.97,4764.025,4776.938,"This Internet for all effort from us is really, it is meant to get us to universal access.",156,,
766,0.97,4779.608,4782.644,You are right.,156,,
767,0.97,4782.644,4789.551,It will give a lot more strength to the movement to have that infrastructure just owned by the municipal government.,156,,
768,0.97,4789.551,4793.155,I look forward to bringing Seattle I.T.,156,,
769,0.97,4793.155,4817.679,"Folks back in a few months, looking at the dashboard, seen whether these issues raised by committee members can make even more progress with private sector providers of this technology.",156,,
770,0.97,4819.047,4821.65,I really want to thank everybody for their work in putting this together.,156,,
771,0.97,4821.65,4823.118,We had you scheduled a month earlier.,156,,
772,0.97,4823.118,4827.389,I am glad it came to today so we could get the information out about the Federal Communiations Commission program.,156,,
773,0.97,4827.389,4842.003,"We will figure out other ways to get that out through Councilmembers having their E newsletters with they can advertise that benefit, which will be really useful for the rest of the pandemic and the lingering effects of it.",156,,
774,0.97,4842.003,4847.509,"Councilmembers, any final comments or questions for our Seattle I.T.",156,,
775,0.97,4847.509,4849.01,Folks?,156,,

820,0.97,5100.328,5106.234,This is the same amendment we approved for all previous surveillance reports.,166,,

836,0.97,5183.611,5184.312,"Thank you, Councilmember.",169,,
837,0.97,5184.312,5186.948,The next four amendments to this bill are sponsored by Councilmember Herbold.,169,,
838,0.97,5186.948,5203.331,"In the mid two would request the police Department develop a policy by the end of the first quarter of 2021, defining the purpose and allowable uses of technology including the circumstances under which the police Department can request the used of technology.",169,,
839,0.97,5203.331,5208.369,I will turn it to Councilmember Herbold if she has any additional comments.,169,,
840,0.97,5208.369,5224.852,"One thing that I think might be helpful, and I am looking to maybe pull it up, you don't have it handy, lise, is for each of these amendments, the Department provided some feedback.",170,,
841,0.97,5224.852,5248.009,"You really helpfully as sort of your response, through their feedback, I am wondering if it might be useful for purposes of the public following along here.",170,,
842,0.97,5248.009,5249.811,Let me see.,170,,
843,0.97,5249.811,5252.213,I am pulling it up right now.,170,,
844,0.97,5252.213,5272.367,They can hear a little bit about whether or not the department had specific Respons for.,170,,
845,0.97,5272.367,5274.502,That'd be great.,170,,
846,0.97,5274.502,5274.802,Thank you.,170,,
847,0.97,5274.802,5275.069,Okay.,171,,
848,0.97,5275.069,5287.615,So this amendment would ask the SPD to identify the circumstances in which SPD can use the technology.,171,,
849,0.97,5287.615,5302.263,Police Department's response identified policies 16060 which is the policy that basically provides the description of how the police Department can call out air support unit from the sheriff's office.,171,,
850,0.97,5302.263,5308.503,That policy cites a life safety incident or a serious crime incident as examples where air support would be beneficial.,171,,
851,0.97,5308.503,5323.785,I would--my response basically is that policy still does not define what a serious crime incident is or restricted use to specific types of crimes.,171,,
852,0.97,5323.785,5324.085,Perfect.,172,,
853,0.97,5324.085,5333.895,That's all I had on that one.,173,,
854,0.97,5333.895,5338.566,"The police Department is saying we have a policy for this, here it is.",174,,
855,0.97,5338.566,5343.404,"Yeah, but we would like it more crystal clear.",174,,
856,0.97,5343.404,5352.013,"This is our real opportunity to weigh in and so we would still like this to be layered into it, is that right?",174,,
857,0.97,5352.013,5352.313,Exactly.,175,,
858,0.97,5352.313,5369.897,The reason why I'm asking that lise Kaye offer this additional detail is because there are three instances of my amendments that I am inclined to agree with SPD.,175,,
859,0.97,5369.897,5402.663,"I just want to be able to for the public to hear that we took the input of SPD and central staff, took another look at the policy and what SPD was saying and we made a determination of whether or not we were going to agree with SPD's analysis or whether or not we were going to ask for that little additional detail in the policy as consistent with the surveillance ordinance.",175,,
860,0.97,5402.663,5403.231,Right.,176,,
861,0.97,5403.231,5412.94,"Colleagues, any questions about this amendment before we move on to the next amendment?",176,,
862,0.97,5412.94,5413.141,Okay.,176,,

864,0.97,5416.244,5418.579,"Thank you, council member.",177,,
865,0.97,5418.579,5432.527,Would ask that the police Department develop policy requiring the Redaction or Deletion of information that may compromise the privacy of individuals not related to a specific investigation.,177,,
866,0.97,5432.527,5440.735,Spd's response was that Department policy does require Deletion of photographic and video evidence not needed for an investigation.,177,,
867,0.97,5440.735,5445.473,I haven't found that specific language in the operating manual.,177,,
868,0.97,5445.473,5464.625,The proposed amendment as with previous one is asking for more specific policy related to.,177,,
869,0.97,5464.625,5468.229,Nothing to add.,178,,
870,0.97,5468.229,5468.596,Thank you.,178,,
871,0.97,5468.596,5472.033,Let's do amendment 4.,179,,
872,0.97,5472.033,5472.3,Okay.,180,,
873,0.97,5472.3,5473.267,Here we go.,180,,
874,0.97,5473.267,5491.819,Amendment 4 sponsored by Council member Herbold request that the police Department prohibit the use of forward looking infrared technology to disproportionately Surveil communities of color and other historically Overpoliced communities.,180,,
875,0.97,5491.819,5495.156,Spd's response cited their policy 5.140 which is bias free policing.,180,,
876,0.97,5495.156,5497.458,They said that addresses the issue.,180,,
877,0.97,5497.458,5516.244,"It States that the Department is quote, committed to eliminating policies and practices that an unwarranted Dispair impact on certain classes.",180,,
878,0.97,5516.244,5527.588,To disproportionately Surveil communities of color.,180,,
879,0.97,5527.588,5528.589,Okay.,181,,
880,0.97,5528.589,5529.657,Nothing to add.,182,,
881,0.97,5529.657,5533.761,I'm intending to move this amendment forward.,182,,

884,0.97,5535.096,5535.396,Okay.,184,,
885,0.97,5535.396,5538.933,This is the last amendment to this particular bill.,184,,
886,0.97,5538.933,5555.383,"So this one sponsored by Council member Herbold requests that starting September 1, 2022 the police Department reports annually on its use of the forward looking infrared technology, including how SPD used the data it collected.",184,,
887,0.97,5555.383,5565.826,The amendments and data that it did collect.,184,,
888,0.97,5565.826,5574.902,In it its response SPD identified a number of workload issues that affect its ability to produce these types of reports.,184,,
889,0.97,5574.902,5583.744,But it does appear that they could at a minimum compile deployment history for the Department's use of forward looking infrared technology.,184,,
890,0.97,5583.744,5592.72,They basically said they probably already have that data and we would just need to put it together.,184,,
891,0.97,5592.72,5593.988,Thank you.,185,,
892,0.97,5593.988,5617.878,I let SPD reminded SPD of this Council's accomplished history of showing flexibility.,185,,
893,0.97,5617.878,5619.246,Thank you.,186,,
894,0.97,5619.246,5638.132,"Thank you, council member Herbold for thoroughly looking at these and then coming up with these amendments and then also the back and forth with SPD and just, you know, this is the Council's main opportunity to put in additional, more explicit language or refined language or Guardrails.",186,,
895,0.97,5638.132,5658.986,"So even if SPD already has a broader policy and we're not saying that they're doing these things that we're putting in the Guardrails for, but this is their opportunity to put the Guardrails in and be more explicit and so appreciate the back and forth dialogue on that.",186,,
896,0.97,5658.986,5668.229,"So from a parliamentary procedure question here, council member Herbold, you're going to be keeping all of your amendments for this one; correct?",186,,
897,0.97,5668.229,5668.796,Correct.,187,,
898,0.97,5668.796,5674.769,So what I'll be doing is I'll move each of the amendments and you can second them and we can go right through them.,188,,
899,0.97,5674.769,5683.711,"But for the other committee members, if you do have any questions about these amendments let us know.",188,,

1017,0.97,6018.379,6026.086,The motion carries and the committee recommendation that the bill passed be sent to the Council meeting for final consideration.,268,,
1018,0.97,6026.086,6030.724,Colleagues we have just two more Council bills on our agenda today.,268,,
1019,0.97,6030.724,6032.259,They're both existing SPD Technologies as well.,268,,
1020,0.97,6032.259,6035.596,We have a series of amendments.,268,,
1021,0.97,6035.596,6041.235,Hopefully you found that parliamentary procedure to be okay and we'll do it for the next two bills as well.,268,,
1022,0.97,6041.235,6046.14,Unless there are any other thoughts on that.,268,,
1023,0.97,6046.14,6051.845,Will the clerk please read the title of the next agenda item into the record?,268,,
1024,0.97,6051.845,6057.184,"Agenda item 9, council bill 120054.",269,,
1025,0.97,6057.184,6076.036,An ordinance relating to surveillance technology implementation authorizing approval of uses and accepting the 2020 surveillance impact report and 2020 executive overview for the Seattle police Department's use of Situational awareness cameras without recording.,269,,
1026,0.97,6076.036,6078.839,"For briefing, discussion and possible vote.",269,,
1027,0.97,6078.839,6079.206,Thank you.,270,,
1028,0.97,6079.206,6092.753,"So once again, let's turn this over to lise Kaye to walk through the amendments.",270,,
1029,0.97,6092.753,6096.957,Then we do have Seattle it and SPD here with us if we have questions.,270,,
1030,0.97,6096.957,6112.039,"The amendments are similar--well, there's one amendment from me which is almost identical to the previous ones on equity assessments and Council member Herbold has amendments we'll walk through.",270,,
1031,0.97,6112.039,6114.041,"Lise Kaye, take it away.",270,,
1032,0.97,6114.041,6118.345,Thank you committee chair.,271,,
1033,0.97,6118.345,6126.053,So Council bill 120054 would approve the surveillance impact reports and authorize the continued use of Situational awareness cameras.,271,,
1034,0.97,6126.053,6129.556,These cameras are used by the S.W.A.T.,271,,
1035,0.97,6129.556,6134.328,Teams to provide visibility from on going incidents from a safe distance.,271,,
1036,0.97,6134.328,6152.346,As you mentioned amendment 1 Council member Pedersen is your amendment that asks for a report on the Metrics that the police Department will provide to the chief technology officer for their annual equity assessment.,271,,
1037,0.97,6152.346,6152.88,Thank you.,272,,
1038,0.97,6152.88,6161.321,Amendment 1 is what we passed on previous bills having SPD report back.,272,,
1039,0.97,6161.321,6166.226,Any comments or questions on this amendment?,272,,
1040,0.97,6166.226,6177.638,We'll go ahead and walk through all the amendments and we'll circle back and do the parliamentary procedure and vote on each one as required.,272,,
1041,0.97,6177.638,6178.438,Thank you.,273,,
1042,0.97,6178.438,6181.742,Amendment 2 is sponsored by Council member Herbold.,273,,
1043,0.97,6181.742,6194.855,"This requests the police Department develop policy by the fourth quarter of 2021 defining the purposes and uses of this technology, including restrictions on down loading or streaming images from these cameras.",273,,
1044,0.97,6194.855,6205.165,"This instance, SPD's response noted the Department currently has policy restrictions on Downloading and streaming of the images from the Situational cameras.",273,,
1045,0.97,6205.165,6205.999,I didn't find those policies.,273,,
1046,0.97,6205.999,6209.203,I wasn't able to find those.,273,,
1047,0.97,6209.203,6214.908,I did look at policies that pertain to photographic evidence.,273,,
1048,0.97,6214.908,6221.114,Those don't specifically prohibit personnel from Downloading or streaming images.,273,,
1049,0.97,6221.114,6239.399,Policy 7.090 on photographic evidence does allow employees to temporarily store working copies of images on a department computer to meet an operational need however these are meant to be removed when the photograph is no longer needed.,273,,
1050,0.97,6239.399,6251.044,The request for this policy is to provide additional clarification that the images from these cameras may not be Downloaded or streamed.,273,,
1051,0.97,6251.044,6254.114,"Why Council member Herbold, would you like to speak to it?",273,,
1052,0.97,6254.114,6255.315,Nothing to add here.,274,,
1053,0.97,6255.315,6269.763,I think this additional clarity around Downloading and streaming images is distinct from the existing policies.,274,,
1054,0.97,6269.763,6277.571,I do intend to move this amendment forward.,274,,
1055,0.97,6277.571,6278.905,Any questions?,275,,
1056,0.97,6278.905,6280.04,Council member Morales.,276,,
1057,0.97,6280.04,6289.65,Not specifically about the amendment but lise you've mentioned you were not able to find policies you were looking for.,277,,
1058,0.97,6289.65,6296.256,Can you just explain what you're talking about so we understand what's going on?,277,,
1059,0.97,6296.256,6296.523,Sure.,278,,
1060,0.97,6296.523,6323.283,I reviewed the operations manual to look at policies to see if I could find the policies that were Referenced in here . I usually send them a list of Uestions and they gave me responses but I did not find the policy that they're Referencing here that prohibits Downloading and streaming of images.,278,,
1061,0.97,6323.283,6352.279,And in the information that we received from SPD in cases when they said we have policies they also included links to where they were pointing where the policies lived and I think those are the places that you looked and didn't necessarily--there were policies but they didn't completely align with the policies we are seeking.,279,,
1062,0.97,6352.279,6352.612,Exactly.,280,,
1063,0.97,6352.612,6362.222,I can send that correspondence from SPD to the committee members as well if they'd like to read it.,281,,
1064,0.97,6362.222,6373.3,There are useful links included around various policies that might touch on some of these.,281,,
1065,0.97,6373.3,6376.636,Those policies are Referenced in the surveillance impact report.,282,,
1066,0.97,6376.636,6382.142,They do provide as much information as they can about how their policies are stated.,282,,
1067,0.97,6382.142,6400.594,"I think there may be a general understanding in the Department that something is done a certain way based on kind of a cumulative interpretation, but that's different than having a specific policy that puts this fine of a point on the issue.",282,,
1068,0.97,6400.594,6420.28,"If there's something we haven't been given access to or if there's something there it just doesn't meet what we're interested in and then you're right, if there is a difference between policy, which is something that is written in and we can point to and practice which is what it sounds like is the response we're getting.",283,,
1069,0.97,6420.28,6425.852,That there isn't actually a policy but our practice is to do something and those are very different.,283,,
1070,0.97,6425.852,6431.725,It would be helpful to see what the correspondence has been.,283,,
1071,0.97,6431.725,6436.062,"And Council members, we have the executive here as guests to our committee.",284,,
1072,0.97,6436.062,6440.534,I'll just leave it up to your discretion whether you want to ask them directly.,284,,
1073,0.97,6440.534,6446.439,"I don't, this is our meeting as Council members.",284,,
1074,0.97,6446.439,6448.208,It's up to you.,284,,
1075,0.97,6448.208,6450.477,They're here as a resource.,284,,
1076,0.97,6450.477,6462.389,"I don't want to necessarily, it's basically up to you whether you want to use this time to have that discussion or not.",284,,
1077,0.97,6462.389,6475.635,Want to be here as a resource and I wanted to remind you they are here but we can also proceed as is.,284,,
1078,0.97,6475.635,6478.138,"Council member Morales, your hand is still raised electronically.",284,,
1079,0.97,6478.138,6481.541,I didn't know if you wanted to keep.,284,,
1080,0.97,6481.541,6486.213,I thought it just lowered automatically once I'd asked my question.,285,,
1081,0.97,6486.213,6494.654,I will actually do that myself.,285,,
1082,0.97,6494.654,6496.256,Thank you.,285,,
1083,0.97,6496.256,6502.462,I think the hand lowering will be like zoom 3.0.,286,,
1084,0.97,6502.462,6506.066,It'll recognize the inflection in our voice and the hand will come down.,287,,
1085,0.97,6506.066,6511.805,It would be helpful.,288,,
1086,0.97,6511.805,6512.205,Okay.,289,,
1087,0.97,6512.205,6516.042,Amendment 3 is sponsored by Council member Herbold.,289,,
1088,0.97,6516.042,6537.764,This would request that the police Department develop a policy by the fourth quarter prohibiting the procurement of Situational awareness cameras equipped with facial recognition or recording capabilities.,289,,
1089,0.97,6537.764,6545.572,They can't use the capabilities without having specific approval that describes that use.,289,,
1090,0.97,6545.572,6562.022,The reports we have do not identify any use of recording with these cameras or facial recognition.,289,,
1091,0.97,6562.022,6596.957,"In this case I am agreeing with the Department and for purposes of this committee meeting unless I get any additional information before full Council, because I believe it is with the obligations in the surveillance ordinance to develop a new for Council approval if capabilities are added outside of the scope of those approved in this legislation.",290,,
1092,0.97,6596.957,6597.791,Thank you.,291,,
1093,0.97,6597.791,6616.276,Is seems the underlying surveillance ordinance already has those structural Guardrails in it place but I appreciate you putting this out there and having that discussion and the police Department certainly knows we have this concern.,291,,
1094,0.97,6616.276,6622.182,"Colleagues, any other comments on this item?",291,,
1095,0.97,6622.182,6624.017,So for the parliamentary procedure of this.,291,,
1096,0.97,6624.017,6628.288,"That was the end of our amendments for this, correct?",291,,
1097,0.97,6628.288,6628.521,Yes.,292,,
1098,0.97,6628.521,6630.924,I'll go ahead and do a similar thing.,293,,
1099,0.97,6630.924,6641.534,I'll put the bill on the table and we'll amend it with amendments in this case one and two and then we'll move on to the last item in our agenda.,293,,
1100,0.97,6641.534,6654.381,Council members I now move that the committee recommend approval of 120054.,293,,
1101,0.97,6654.381,6656.683,Is there a second?,293,,

1185,0.97,6972.031,6973.599,What could possibly go wrong?,344,,
1186,0.97,6973.599,6978.237,I could give you a lesson on what could go wrong.,345,,
1187,0.97,6978.237,6979.806,Oh look at that.,346,,
1188,0.97,6979.806,6982.975,Look at you.,347,,

1195,0.97,6989.849,7007.233,"Okay, so amendment 2 is sponsored by Council member Herbold and this one would request that the police Department develop a policy by the fourth quarter of 2021 defining the purpose and only allowable uses of these Video recording systems.",349,,
1196,0.97,7007.233,7009.669,Spd's response noted the allowable uses are controlled by Department policy.,349,,
1197,0.97,7009.669,7027.186,They didn't say it directly but the purpose and uses I think for this technology are well summarized in and completely summarized in the executive overview which would be approved if Council passed Council bill 120055.,349,,
1198,0.97,7027.186,7027.687,Thank you.,350,,
1199,0.97,7027.687,7053.413,"In this instance I do concur that the executive overview is itself contains a policy defining purpose and use of this technology and for that reason, you know, purpose and use which identifies the allowable purposes and allowable uses of the Video recording systems and for that reason I'm going to hold this amendment.",350,,
1200,0.97,7053.413,7054.647,Thank you.,351,,
1201,0.97,7054.647,7055.748,That's an excellent point.,351,,
1202,0.97,7055.748,7076.235,The actual ordinance we're approving comes with an executive overview and that layers in some clarification already from the Department on what they're doing and we are then approving that here today.,351,,
1203,0.97,7076.235,7080.039,So that's already baked in.,351,,
1204,0.97,7080.039,7090.016,Let's go to amendment 3. one moment.,351,,
1205,0.97,7090.016,7099.325,There is something shameful about me needing to have the chairman of the committee run his screen.,352,,

1213,0.97,7119.245,7127.286,"Spd didn't provide specific comments on this, however their response to amendment 3 to the Situational awareness cameras does apply here.",356,,
1214,0.97,7127.286,7142.502,Should the Department wish to use any facial recognition technology provided by or through these Video recording systems the Department would need to receive Council authorization through a new surveillance impact report.,356,,
1215,0.97,7142.502,7143.703,Council member Herbold.,357,,
1216,0.97,7143.703,7144.704,That summarizes it well.,358,,
1217,0.97,7144.704,7152.678,Just for the viewing public I'm holding and asking that we not vote on amendments 2 and 3 in this legislation.,358,,

1220,0.97,7153.679,7171.163,"You explain it well in the previous bill the reasoning for that, the underlying surveillance ordinance should provide Guardrails where they're required to come back with us if they are adopting any new surveillance Technologies.",359,,
1221,0.97,7171.163,7171.464,Thank you.,359,,
1222,0.97,7171.464,7175.201,Council members I'll go ahead and do the parliamentary procedure for this.,359,,
