3,0.97,56.089,69.469,"Madame chair, can you please call the alternate cast member",2,,
4,0.97,69.469,70.87,Cast member Morales.,3,,
5,0.97,70.87,71.137,Here.,4,,
6,0.97,71.137,75.008,"Thank you for joining us this morning, Miss Morales.",5,,
7,0.97,75.008,79.212,Good to see you and thank you for being here.,5,,
8,0.97,79.212,103.837,"If we have any additional colleagues joining us today to hear updates on Budget-Related items such as the revenue forecast, we will make sure to announce them as they join.",5,,
9,0.97,103.837,113.246,"Colleague, we do have a full agenda today.",5,,
10,0.97,113.246,115.815,We are looking at the SPD grant legislation bill.,5,,
11,0.97,115.815,123.223,We have been talking about including this specific for the Seattle police Department in today's deliberations to try to make sure we gave it additional time.,5,,
12,0.97,123.223,129.262,"We are still going to give this additional time, but we are going to do that during the budget process.",5,,
13,0.97,129.262,150.55,Our team was not able to accomplish the item within the 24-hour public notification requirement listed under Rcw- 42.30.Old 0 as this relates .080.,5,,
14,0.97,150.55,158.491,"The times has stricter requirements for when items can be published with the agenda, so my sincere apologies.",5,,
15,0.97,158.491,165.965,I know this is a item people had been Yeagley discussing so we can get to the heart of some of the questions.,5,,
16,0.97,165.965,172.705,"On Monday I talked about if you have questions related to the grant, we will be discussing those.",5,,
17,0.97,172.705,174.507,We will still do that.,5,,
18,0.97,174.507,178.311,"Greg Doss from central staff, thank you, for sending out the questions.",5,,
19,0.97,178.311,179.612,There was a lot.,5,,
20,0.97,179.612,193.993,It was unknown if there would be enough time today to get through the questions and vote out the grant acceptance ordinance but we will include it for 2021 in the budget deliberations and Greg and other members of central staff will be there.,5,,
21,0.97,193.993,211.244,"If you have sent question, and I know many of you have, the questions are being processed and we will have a full presentation by central staff and the opportunity, of course, to work with the Department personnel, as well, to report on any questions, so I want to apologize for that.",5,,
22,0.97,211.244,223.156,"As a reminder, this was 2021 grant acceptance dollar, many of this are being reimbursed and typically it is included in the grant acceptance ordinance annually.",5,,
23,0.97,223.156,226.826,This year we are not doing the typical quarter four.,5,,
24,0.97,226.826,238.638,Because of that the executive asked for Council to consider the SPD items separately from the citywide grants ordinance that we just voted out in August.,5,,
25,0.97,238.638,253.519,Since today is our last housing and Finance Committee meeting we will be taking up the item again with the special budget committee along with the rest of the year's grant acceptance ordinances and the rest of the budget legislation.,5,,
26,0.97,253.519,262.595,"I know Councilmembers had other questions, they will be queued up and have the time to answer them with ample time.",5,,
27,0.97,262.595,264.998,"Before we move on, Council President, please go ahead.",5,,
28,0.97,264.998,297.597,"Quick question, mostly related to process that you highlighted for the grant acceptance ordinance, if it is going to the select budget committee process, are you anticipating we will vote on the grant acceptance ordinance a it is end of the budget process, or are you expecting and anticipating that the select budget committee will consider that ordinance early on in our process and then vote out of committee and send it to full council?",6,,
29,0.97,297.597,313.279,"I am trying to get a sense of the timing and whether you have heard from Cvo or the Department, any input related to the timing of when we do the grant acceptance ordinance?",6,,
30,0.97,313.279,316.649,"Thank you very much, Council President, and, again, thanks for your grace.",7,,
31,0.97,316.649,321.988,"I know we need to work with the office to Re-Refer the legislation, as well.",7,,
32,0.97,321.988,328.494,I believe in talking to members of central staff that we would be taking it up with everything during budget.,7,,
33,0.97,328.494,340.773,"I will have to confirm with them if that means at the end of processing the 2022 budget, or if that is simultaneous, and if you have a preference, we will be happy to work with you, as well.",7,,
34,0.97,340.773,367.166,"I don't think I have a preference developed now but I would like to have conversations about the impact of waiting until the end of the budget process accept and consider the grant ordinance, because there is a bunch of budget related legislation that we usually vote on at the very, very end, which puts us into mid to end of November.",8,,
35,0.97,367.166,398.197,"I want to make sure I have an understanding of whether there are any sort of operational impacts as a result of waiting until the edged of November, particularly since I think at our last Finance and housing committee meeting we talked about sort of an understanding we would consider it soon are than then.",8,,
36,0.97,398.197,432.732,I want to get an idea of the operational impacts as a result of waiting for the grant ordinance together with the 2022 Budget-Related legislation and whether there is a chance to get it off the plate by October?,8,,
37,0.97,432.732,433.666,I appreciate that.,9,,
38,0.97,433.666,465.698,"Part of the goal for having it on today's agenda was to deal with the grant acceptance for 2021 prior to having to take something up in a typical quarter 4, because you are all well aware of our effort to try to move to a Mid-Year supplemental and a regular budget deliberation session so we are not in the position we are in every year, especially last year where we passed a robust budget for the up coming calendar year and then have to process the 4TH quarter.",9,,
39,0.97,465.698,467.266,I really appreciate that suggestion Kim President.,9,,
40,0.97,467.266,475.842,"Your goal is the same as mine, to have had this processed before we deliberate on the 2022 budget.",9,,
41,0.97,475.842,485.418,"Choice chair, I know this was of interest to you and I apologize because I know you had a number of areas you were interested in diving in, so please go ahead.",9,,
42,0.97,485.418,487.42,I want to flag in.,10,,
43,0.97,487.42,519.218,"It is related but a slightly different issue I am raising than the perspective, the grants have not been received.",10,,
44,0.97,519.218,567.6,"To the extent the Council is interested in influencing the perspective grants and whether or not they are pursued will be losing that opportunity if we--the longer--we could be losing the opportunity for some of those the longer we wait, so just want to flag that it was my understanding that the Council felt very, very strongly last year that we didn't want to just be Rubber- stamping the grant acceptance after the fact and central staff went to great pains to make a determination of the items in the grant acceptance, which ones had already--the work had already been committed to, and which ones still were at question.",10,,
45,0.97,567.6,580.246,"I think that there is, like, again, a likelihood that the longer we wait for that second bunch, we will have less influence over those areas if, in fact, those are areas we want influence over.",10,,
46,0.97,580.246,581.414,I agree.,11,,
47,0.97,581.414,581.714,I agree.,11,,
48,0.97,581.714,583.182,Thank you very much.,11,,
49,0.97,583.182,591.791,"And both what you have said, vice chair, and what the Council President have said underscore the urgency of having this conversation prior to budget.",11,,
50,0.97,591.791,595.428,"Again, that was the hope and expectation for today.",11,,
51,0.97,595.428,617.416,"I am going to ask colleagues for us to be able to get back to you if there is a chance for us to either take this up very early in the budget deliberations, which, again, begin in a Week-And-A-Half here, or if there is a chance for us to work with you, Council President, on a Timeline that makes sense given the up coming budget with full Council, would be happy to do so.",11,,
52,0.97,617.416,623.022,Both of you have underscored the same goal I have to get this out as quickly as possible.,11,,
53,0.97,623.022,624.657,Not out.,11,,
54,0.97,624.657,624.957,Excuse me.,11,,
55,0.97,624.957,632.531,Let me Rephrase that--Deliberated and fully understood so we can have a conversation about the allocation of these grant dollars and acceptance of the money.,11,,
56,0.97,632.531,652.451,"But I do want to reiterate for folks reasoning, these are 2021- dollars, both what the Council president and Vice-Chair have said are important in term of the timing, so colleagues and members of the public, if we can get back to you on the exact timing of when to take this up, that would be appreciated.",11,,
57,0.97,652.451,654.053,A thumbs up from the President.,11,,
58,0.97,654.053,654.353,Thank you.,11,,
59,0.97,654.353,677.309,Appreciate your flexibility there and we will get back to you with the timing as soon as possible.,11,,
60,0.97,714.313,718.117,"Hearing no objection, today's agenda is adopted.",11,,

103,0.97,1156.688,1158.39,"Good morning, Councilmembers.",17,,
104,0.97,1158.39,1161.693,I am the current policy manager for Ols.,17,,
105,0.97,1161.693,1163.295,I use she or her pronounce.,17,,
106,0.97,1163.295,1171.27,The pandemic has had and continues to have significant impact and unique impact on our workplaces.,17,,
107,0.97,1171.27,1183.415,It highlighted Pre-Existing racial and social equities in working and social benefits and these issues are at the heart of Ols's mission.,17,,
108,0.97,1183.415,1194.927,"We have labor standards, critical supports for dignity and low wage works, people of color, immigrants and refugees, women of the Lgbtq+ community and those that live at the intersections of those identities.",17,,
109,0.97,1194.927,1202.734,These workers are often Overrepresented in low wage positions and are subject to and at higher risk of labor standards violations.,17,,
110,0.97,1202.734,1206.038,During the pandemic we took very seriously our responsibility to center race equity in our work.,17,,
111,0.97,1206.038,1210.242,There are a number of ways that racial justice showed up in our response.,17,,
112,0.97,1210.242,1227.626,"It showed up in the implementation of new laws to protect essential workers Li% E gig worker, implementation of existing laws like Psst and amendments to that law to insure that works could gain access to that benefit during the pandemic.",17,,
113,0.97,1227.626,1236.335,We had also showed up in how we shared information out with the community to both workers and small businesses.,17,,
114,0.97,1236.335,1242.14,"We simplified Messaging, multiple language, and different methods that were designed to reach as many workers at possible.",17,,
115,0.97,1242.14,1255.32,"It showed up in our introduced support for our contract partners, which are primarily led, ornamented or served by P.O.T.",17,,
116,0.97,1255.32,1263.962,Communities so we wanted to make sure we could insure the support of small businesses while adjusting to the pandemic conditions.,17,,
117,0.97,1263.962,1275.707,"It showed up in adjusting priorities to insure quick resolution of labor standard, like those Promulgate for the gig workers and this year grocery employees.",17,,
118,0.97,1275.707,1278.31,"Those had deep impacts in pot workers, as well.",17,,
119,0.97,1278.31,1299.731,"It showed up in other departments, as well to make sure information and resources reached the communities most in need, capturing low waged, displaced and implement workers that would not easily gain access to food vouchers, face coverings, information about unemployment, etc.",17,,
120,0.97,1299.731,1307.005,Ols will continue to invest our efforts in undoing and preventing racial inequity as we continue to respond to the pandemic and our work.,17,,
121,0.97,1307.005,1318.183,"With that, I would like to hand it over to Jasmine Marwaha, one of our policy analysts to talk about the change team's efforts.",17,,
122,0.97,1318.183,1318.45,Yes.,18,,
123,0.97,1318.45,1327.626,"Thank you, my name is Jasmine and I am a policy analyst with Ols and the change team at Ols.",18,,
124,0.97,1327.626,1340.872,The change team's mission is to Ireradicate Institutioned implicit and explicit racism within the office of labor standards including internal practices and policies and external policy enforcement.,18,,
125,0.97,1340.872,1352.084,"In 2019 we focused on getting staff trained up, including arranging for all Ols staff to participate in the people's Institute Northwest Antiracism training.",18,,
126,0.97,1352.084,1363.428,"We also advocated for better advancement opportunities for our Admin and staff in the Department and we love the implementation of Ols's racial equity tool kit, many of which you will hear about later in the presentation.",18,,
127,0.97,1363.428,1371.536,"For our 2020, our main highlight is we are still here!",18,,
128,0.97,1371.536,1395.727,"We spent some time Reimagining change given our lack of capacity and given the fact that many of our Department staff were former change team members or steeped in Rji work in other ways through the Covid response, mostly, or through ongoing work that they were doing on racial equity Toolkits.",18,,
129,0.97,1395.727,1403.535,So that we really wanted to celebrate.,18,,
130,0.97,1526.992,1535.467,With the goal of trying these on with the 2021 year and the commitment of coming back together to kind of evaluate how that all worked and how to improve that process.,18,,
131,0.97,1535.467,1547.879,"So, we are really excited to see how this year pans out and come back next year and reevaluate.",18,,
132,0.97,1547.879,1557.689,With that it is my pleasure to hand it over to Katie Jo Keppinger.,18,,
133,0.97,1557.689,1558.49,Thank you.,19,,
134,0.97,1558.49,1561.793,My name is Katie Jo.,19,,
135,0.97,1561.793,1567.866,I am the current enforcement manager at Ols.,19,,
136,0.97,1567.866,1571.67,I use She/Her pronounce.,19,,
137,0.97,1571.67,1589.087,The Coef started in 2015 and the 2021-Is for $3 million which funds 15 organizations over 24 months.,19,,
138,0.97,1589.087,1600.999,C organization a partnership is key because our Cof works experience labor issues and will most likely not raise those concerns.,19,,
139,0.97,1600.999,1602.601,They have seen key challenges.,19,,
140,0.97,1602.601,1608.273,You will see those challenges on the left column of the chart.,19,,
141,0.97,1608.273,1653.385,"The 2022 crews are the culmination of two years of the enforcement's collaboration with the Coef partners to address the challenges, including creation of a community intake referral form which is a tool for Coef partners to use when making referrals to the office that is less burdensome for workers, creating a more accessible Handout which makes our information process more AC Settable for workers to understand and deepening relationship where is consistent One-On-One quarterly trains that allow for customized content and questions.",19,,
142,0.97,1653.385,1667.866,The key success was getting the feedback from partners and Buy- in throughout the process.,19,,
143,0.97,1667.866,1674.105,Covid-19 increased standards on labor violations and most feared losing their jobs if they reported violations.,19,,
144,0.97,1674.105,1685.417,One way to reduce this was worker relief funds that they could immediately have access to if they with are fire from the their jobs.,19,,
145,0.97,1685.417,1703.835,"Before we move on to discuss racial equity tool kits, this block print was created by artist and long-time Ols senior investigator Sarah Lare that passed away last August.",19,,
146,0.97,1703.835,1710.742,She was deeply committed to racial equity work and it was very important to her.,19,,
147,0.97,1710.742,1713.044,She made such a huge contribution to us.,19,,
148,0.97,1713.044,1720.719,She was a rare gem and we feel her loss everyday.,19,,
149,0.97,1720.719,1724.289,Now to my colleague Meghan Jackson talking about the accessibility guide.,19,,

202,0.97,2083.381,2105.303,"In 2019 we wanted to insure that the community outreach and education fund request for proposal guidelines and the company process were easy to understand and accessible for community organizations, in particular those led by staff or serving B Ipo C community members.",28,,
203,0.97,2105.303,2115.713,"Our team for the tool kit consisted of Ols outreach staff, investigators and our Finance and operations manager.",28,,
204,0.97,2115.713,2140.771,Our Stakeholder process included One-On-One interviews with community organizations that previously applied to the Rfp and organizations that had not previously applied by served low wage one community commented that it was refreshing to an gauge community organizations on ways to make the application process better and wished more Funders would do this process.,28,,
205,0.97,2140.771,2147.378,Three key issues were Repetty and con sorrow routed Rfp language.,28,,
206,0.97,2147.378,2158.489,The application process favored seasoned grant writing skilled and there was inequitable opportunity for applicants with stronger oral communication and In-Language skills.,28,,
207,0.97,2158.489,2160.658,"Next slide, please.",28,,
208,0.97,2160.658,2174.338,So our three recommendations were to Declutter and simplify the Rfp language.,28,,
209,0.97,2174.338,2176.173,We took inspiration from Mari.,28,,
210,0.97,2176.173,2187.618,We eliminated legal and complex sentences and create an accessible application process by replacing the broad 20 page narrative with a Question-And- answer application template.,28,,
211,0.97,2187.618,2204.435,"The written application was more accessible to all levels of Grant-Writing skills, and accommodating oral communication and In-Language skills, applicant it is the option to request an oral presentation to answer application questions instead of submitting a written form.",28,,
212,0.97,2204.435,2206.504,Applicants could also request an interpreter if needed.,28,,
213,0.97,2206.504,2220.217,"We covered even though there was a process for applicants to answer application questions through an oral presentation, none of the applicants took this option because they felt like it was Safeer to Aplow with a written application.",28,,
214,0.97,2220.217,2224.055,This showed us how deeply Internalled written applications are in funding culture.,28,,
215,0.97,2224.055,2235.032,"Organizations didn't feel they could trust if they choose an oral application, the application would be as strong as other written applications.",28,,
216,0.97,2235.032,2250.448,For there to be a shift on written application emphasis the cities would sorrow change.,28,,
217,0.97,2250.448,2256.387,Now I will pass this on to my colleague Ahmed Abdi.,28,,
218,0.97,2256.387,2286.15,"My name is Ahmed Abdi, and an engage many specialist and oversee the business and education fund which is known as Bef, designed to increase compliance by building partnership with trusted committed organizations that engage small business, owned by low income franchised companies.",29,,
219,0.97,2286.15,2305.736,"In 2020 the Bef team decided to review the 2017 to 2020Bef request of proposal, Rfp to evaluate whether the process was creating barriers to have success in the application.",29,,
220,0.97,2305.736,2319.917,"We were all looking at the same way to improve how the application was designed, previously for Coef and Boef.",29,,
221,0.97,2319.917,2332.163,The team used the racial equity tool kit to streamline the process of Rfp.,29,,
222,0.97,2332.163,2373.037,"Rfp process by narrowing the scope which included and SIMPLIFYING this work outcome with an RSGI lens, meaning what work we want to invest to perform then number, qualitative and quantitative performance and number three, examining the use of profession service providers that can promote compliance and consider multiple Rfp with different scope and example of contract only with technical assistance or contract for only for Door- To-Door outreach.",29,,
223,0.97,2373.037,2382.713,The Boef team engaged includes ethnic discussions to identify issues regarding the Rfp process.,29,,
224,0.97,2382.713,2389.453,There were two main issues that the Boef team identified.,29,,
225,0.97,2389.453,2403.2,"Number one, the community organizations had fewer--to comply with the Rfp application including staffing, language barriers and less knowledge of the grant process as threw already had.",29,,
226,0.97,2403.2,2418.182,The Bo education f Rfp was too technical and it was imperative to simplify that to make the process more equitable to everybody.,29,,
227,0.97,2418.182,2449.48,"And after engaging the Stakeholders and the recommendation we received was number one, SIMPLIFYING the application scope and process to include professional services such as accountants, lawyers and Atc, three, consider multiple reconciliation Fp with different scopes.",29,,
228,0.97,2466.363,2478.175,We have translation and also considering other Feedbacks that we have gotten from the Stakeholders in the community feature.,29,,

232,0.97,2481.212,2493.224,"I want to give you a little bit of a preview of some of the things we are thinking act, certainly working on for 2021.",30,,
233,0.97,2493.224,2504.702,"This came through our own process internally at looking at the work we are doing, trying to focus our efforts in place where is our RSGI work can really make a difference.",30,,
234,0.97,2504.702,2506.604,Some is focused internally and some is in the community.,30,,
235,0.97,2506.604,2511.842,This is a preview for what we will probably be able to report to you next year so you are aware.,30,,
236,0.97,2511.842,2520.618,"We have an internal group to start with, to build our own capacity around Rsji that we are discussing, issues around race and social justice.",30,,
237,0.97,2520.618,2537.968,We started with the t of so you want to talk about race and really use that as an opportunity for internal staff conversations and awareness.,30,,
238,0.97,2537.968,2542.973,We have worked with OCR to incorporate these principles in our work.,30,,
239,0.97,2542.973,2563.093,"We are working, continuing the work we are doing on the data demographic Ret that you heard about from Carmie to really use that information in Weighings that target our enforcement efforts and help us learn more about who we are Impacting and thinking about ways that we can use that to target our outreach effort, as well.",30,,
240,0.97,2563.093,2618.248,"There was a lot of interest in thinking about how our work connects with our community, particularly immigrant communities and the ways that we want to think about working with immigrant rights organizations and strengthening those connections so we can work more closely, particularly when we look at some of the communities that are effected specifically by some of our ordinances like the domestic workers ordinances, hotel workers and others where we have large group of immigrant worker, immigrant workers are facing a lot of different pressures, trying to figure out how we can increase our ways of connecting with organizations that work on immigrant rights so that when there are issues that come up, we can do things like help them get new Visas and continue to remain in the country and change status if that is necessary based upon what the worker wants to do, so this group is really looking at a spectrum of issues.",30,,
241,0.97,2618.248,2622.219,Then we also identified issues related to how we distribute settlement checks.,30,,
242,0.97,2622.219,2638.769,"Do we do them in ways particularly now with Covid and having limited time to access the office, how do we make sure that workers get the money they are entitled to, that they get in ways they with use.",30,,
243,0.97,2638.769,2643.374,Obviously workers don't always have banks easily accessible and able to come to the office.,30,,
244,0.97,2643.374,2651.382,How do we change the process to make them more equitable and center the experience of workers receiving checks as a basis for our discussion.,30,,
245,0.97,2651.382,2662.793,"This is an Ret we are working on right now and I look forward to learning more, thinking of how to change up our processes and use that to be more response I have to the community.",30,,
246,0.97,2662.793,2664.194,Let's move to the next slide.,30,,

252,0.97,2698.862,2711.842,I think that this work is another example of why we are proud of Ols for being a leading model not just across the nation for labor standards but within departments for the Rsj work.,31,,
253,0.97,2711.842,2730.094,"I am really excited to see this work and I want to also NOTE my appreciation for your entire team, including Sarah Lair, who we know was a big champion of workplace standards and making sure small businesses have the information they need and is deeply missed.",31,,

259,0.97,2758.889,2785.716,"The challenge on the slide that related to the enforcement partnership, there is a reference to the language on the Website being difficult to understand and including a lot of legal language and solution, great, is identified as a graphic Handout.",32,,
260,0.97,2785.716,2793.49,"And I think having physical materials to give to people is great, but it is not clear that the Website was also updated.",32,,
261,0.97,2793.49,2796.693,Maybe it with us updated with a Pdf of the Handout.,32,,
262,0.97,2796.693,2801.465,I am not sure but I wanted to check to see that the Website is also updated.,32,,
263,0.97,2801.465,2807.204,"I can answer that is my recollection is yes, it was.",33,,
264,0.97,2807.204,2823.554,"We replaced the lengthy Pdf with a shorter, more easy, friendly one and removed a lot of the language from that Website page as well.",33,,
265,0.97,2823.554,2826.39,Thank you.,34,,
266,0.97,2826.39,2827.824,Any additional questions?,35,,

268,0.97,2836.466,2843.473,You had the pleasure of starting a new job in the midst of the pandemic.,35,,
269,0.97,2843.473,2859.223,So Pre-Pandemic with the previous Council there was a lot of questions that then Council President Harold had asked about the way businesses were being left out or inappropriately investigated.,35,,
270,0.97,2859.223,2869.7,It was an issue that kept coming up in the committee meeting but I think the report here clearly Rebukes those comments and concerns.,35,,
271,0.97,2869.7,2885.716,What we are seeing here is a lot of analysis of how small businesses and the investigation work that Ols does is really rooted in Rsj principles and rooted in equity.,35,,
272,0.97,2885.716,2890.487,I wanted to lift that up in case anyone is remembers some of those questions from 2019.,35,,
273,0.97,2890.487,2901.331,"I think it is a good, well Researched response to those concerns and we always want to raise the concerns when we hear them, but I want to make sure when we have answers to those concerns that they also get the air time needed.",35,,
274,0.97,2901.331,2903.033,"So, I want to do lift that up.",35,,
275,0.97,2903.033,2920.284,"If you have comment, you are welcome to Chime in on them, specific to the outreach and engagement and investigation aspect with small businesses, but I thought that was an important element to remind us of why that information is so important.",35,,
276,0.97,2920.284,2920.517,Great.,35,,
277,0.97,2920.517,2921.451,I am seeing some nods.,35,,
278,0.97,2921.451,2945.075,"Thank you very much for that observation, Councilmember Mosqueda.",36,,
279,0.97,2945.075,2950.38,I think we understand the impact on the small business community.,36,,
280,0.97,2950.38,2962.859,We want to assist businesses to do the things they want to do and should be doing to help their workers and helping their workers is also good for business and with many of our communities those connections between business owners and workers are very close.,36,,
281,0.97,2962.926,2970.1,"O, we are not talking about people who are coming from opposite ends of the universe, particularly as it relates to many of our small businesses.",36,,
282,0.97,2970.1,2973.036,So we think that is smart for economic recovery.,36,,
283,0.97,2973.036,2984.114,"We think that is smart for community well being, and the work we are doing with our Bof partners and that they are doing in the community, number one, to remember they are grounded in the community.",36,,
284,0.97,2984.114,3007.104,We work with organizations that have direct relationships with small businesses who are coming to them for a variety of different types of advice and the types of advice they get from our partners and the information they are passing is part of a portfolio they get.,36,,
285,0.97,3007.104,3064.895,"I think the investigations that we are doing, I am very pleased that some of the recent coverage that we have had for some of the work we have done, could believe a lot of that tends to relate to some of the bigger initiatives with larger businesses when you look at who those workers are, the big worker industry talking about Uber and lift drivers we are happy to see the impacts from investigations but our enforcement team looks at who comes in and really looks at opportunities to make sure that businesses contacts understand what is going on.",36,,
286,0.97,3064.895,3069.199,A large portion of the companies end up in settlement which is a good thing.,36,,
287,0.97,3069.199,3081.011,The business understands the need and the workers get the compensation and we do that as often and when we can so I am happy to continue the conversation.,36,,
288,0.97,3081.011,3082.512,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda for the recognition.",36,,

290,0.97,3083.28,3083.814,Wonderful answer.,37,,
291,0.97,3083.814,3101.031,"I want to bottle that up and take it with me as we talk about the importance of labor standard, coordination, not just the worker side by the employer side.",37,,
292,0.97,3101.031,3134.898,"Also not just the settlements you receive that have been meaningful to workers Righting wrongs so our employers can get on the right track, but with the cases that you have won, I think it send as really important message out to the broader public, as well.",37,,
293,0.97,3147.344,3168.398,"I am thankful for your work on helping to educate folk, identify settlements and helping to identify ways in which we push the information out so more people understand the importance of compliance and keep it here in our local economy.",37,,

340,0.97,3642.038,3648.644,These are the details about the proviso lift organization in front of you today.,47,,
341,0.97,3648.644,3654.183,There is a proviso in the 2021 adopted budget.,47,,
342,0.97,3654.183,3687.316,"This proviso moves the $30 million allocate from the Finance general to Opcd and office of arts and culture between last week and this week, it became clear they were best suited to manage several of the contracts given the existing relationships they have with the award's.",47,,
343,0.97,3687.316,3714.11,"Once the proviso is lifted, O with, CD and arts will begin the contracting process and we will not be announcing the award publicly until the transactions are finalized.",47,,
344,0.97,3714.11,3714.911,That is all we have.,47,,
345,0.97,3714.911,3716.312,"Well, thank you.",48,,
346,0.97,3716.312,3721.35,We are doing our part to move this forward so the community can receive the funds.,48,,
347,0.97,3721.35,3736.466,"I am sure there are a few questions, but, first, thank you to all of you for your work, the community advisory board for their thoughtful work with the Department in identifying projects and the selection application and selection process and project application.",48,,
348,0.97,3736.466,3749.579,"We know there is a lot of problem, as well, that were requested with these funds and not every project that made the criteria is necessarily getting the funding today.",48,,
349,0.97,3749.579,3778.374,"We want to know more about those proctors out there and working with you and community partners and as we look at other opportunities for revenue to be available such as jump start, it is my intention that we are able to identify some of those problems that have met criteria but don't have enough funding to see what we can do in the up coming budget so I look forward to working with you all on that problem process.",48,,
350,0.97,3778.374,3779.008,A few quick notes.,48,,
351,0.97,3779.008,3780.476,We are substitute in front of us today.,48,,
352,0.97,3780.476,3787.917,I want to give you a Heads-Up and talk more about it with central staff here.,48,,
353,0.97,3787.917,3803.733,"It would be a administrative change shifting the appropriations to provide $5.6 million of the $30 million funds to office of arts apple culture, and the remaining amount would say at Opcd.",48,,
354,0.97,3803.733,3823.252,"The reason for the shift, it with us discovered there were at least two contracts with the office of arts & amp; culture that has already established contracts with some of the grant Awardees and it makes it easier for us to have more streamlined administration of the grants if we have those housed within the same Department.",48,,
355,0.97,3823.252,3834.497,"It doesn't have an impact on the projects or the selected amounts for award, it is simply an administrative change that would be In-Process to leverage the existing contracts.",48,,
356,0.97,3834.497,3861.39,"Before we consider that amendment, though, I want to make sure we have a chance to take any questions or comments on the underlying bill.",48,,
357,0.97,3872.134,3875.271,I move to Ameant the Council bill substituting version 2 for version 1b.,48,,
358,0.97,3875.271,3876.272,Is is there a second?,48,,
359,0.97,3876.272,3876.572,Second.,49,,
360,0.97,3876.572,3878.107,Thank you so much.,50,,
361,0.97,3878.107,3882.278,It has been moved and Seconded.,50,,
362,0.97,3882.278,3884.513,Is is there any additional comment on this substitute?,50,,
363,0.97,3884.513,3891.12,I guess I will just ask one question.,51,,
364,0.97,3891.12,3904.3,"Immigrant glad we have Councilmember Morales here today, often part of our committee meetings as an alternate and of be a chair of arts, so it is a good opportunity for us to make sure we are connecting the dots and ask the Department, as well.",51,,
365,0.97,3904.3,3909.739,It does seem like there is quite a bit of overlay with the priorities you are looking at and arts and culture.,51,,
366,0.97,3909.739,3938.567,"Is is there more that you might be able to tell us about why it is just the 5.6, or is there an opportunity at some point in the future to identify more of the potential grants once they become known to see what synergy mixes with the alternates & amp; culture and Council Councilmember Morales is part of this.",51,,
367,0.97,3938.567,3939.168,Feel free to Chime.,51,,
368,0.97,3939.168,3942.038,"In thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda for the question.",52,,
369,0.97,3942.038,3967.163,"To your point, I think with the pro Vie sew lift, that one of the things on my--I mean, fingers crossed--to look at how we move into implement phase.",52,,
370,0.97,3967.163,3979.308,"So with all the organizations that we will be awarded funds and entering contract with, one of the thing is community needs to be best supported in the work.",52,,
371,0.97,3979.308,3998.094,"So, you know, as early identifications we have two Awardees that we know already have contractual relationships with arts in place today so we want to make sure to just make sure those dollars get allocated to arts right now.",52,,
372,0.97,3998.094,4033.462,"I think there are others we want to take a look at and have African extended conversation with arts and with our own staff to figure out what the best contractual relationship, who should be in the lead, who are the partners that support the organizations that are getting funding and that is a process I want to jump into as soon as we have a proviso lift and can take that next step forward.",52,,
373,0.97,4033.462,4038.601,I hope that answers the question.,52,,
374,0.97,4038.601,4039.635,"And Councilmember, Morales, please go ahead.",52,,
375,0.97,4039.635,4040.269,Thank you.,53,,
376,0.97,4040.269,4047.476,I think it is important to understand some of the context here.,53,,
377,0.97,4047.476,4078.441,"The arts Department, the division here has been meeting for quite some time for several years to really think about the intersection of these three departments as it relates to our artist sector, our creative industries, and how to support and advance the sector, because we know that the arts industry, the creative economy, contributes to about 20% of Seattle's GDP which is, I think, four times as much in the country, so it is really an important sector.",53,,
378,0.97,4078.441,4098.661,"I think the fact that there is a relationship, a connection to community development, to economic development, to land use, is a result of that years of collaboration that has been happening with community, with our artists and arts industry folks.",53,,
379,0.97,4098.661,4108.304,"This year we created the--maybe it was last year, created the cultural space agency PDA.",53,,
380,0.97,4108.304,4114.777,"That is one piece, really critical piece, or the work these three departments have been doing together in partnership with community.",53,,
381,0.97,4114.777,4116.545,But it is just one piece.,53,,
382,0.97,4116.545,4126.222,There is a lot of work that still has to happen that community has been deeply involved in.,53,,
383,0.97,4126.222,4131.927,An these kinds of development opportunities are all part of that work and really need to be integrated well.,53,,
384,0.97,4131.927,4159.188,"I am a excited to see that apparently there is at least some of that funding that is part of the arts conversation that will be moving forward, but the work is really just beginning and the relationship and the connections community needs to remain very strong so that all of the work and time that they have put into this in the last few years is honored, and that we actually get to see, you know--it comes to fruition and really serves the community that way.",53,,
385,0.97,4159.188,4163.125,I am eager to get moving on these pieces that we are getting.,53,,
386,0.97,4163.125,4163.425,Thank you.,53,,
387,0.97,4163.425,4165.594,Thank you very much.,54,,
388,0.97,4165.594,4183.279,"We will look forward to additional conversations to come in October and beyond about how that alignment with the arts Department--and I would also call the arts Commission in their important role here, how they will interact with the grants going forward and the Grantees.",54,,
389,0.97,4183.279,4187.116,"Okay, I want to thank Councilmember Morales not only for being here but the comments.",54,,
390,0.97,4187.116,4194.723,I am really happy we are able to integrate that line of questioning as it relates to these contracts.,54,,
391,0.97,4194.723,4197.026,I also want to welcome Councilmember Lewis who has joined us.,54,,
392,0.97,4197.026,4198.394,Thank you for being here.,54,,

394,0.97,4209.305,4229.291,"Madame clerk, I don't see any additional question or so comments so let's call the roll on the package of amendment to Cb120178 by sub city Tuesdaying version two for version 1b.",54,,

449,0.97,4565.56,4577.973,As soon as we get the language from the Army for the lease agreement we would actually recommend that legislation get referred directly to full Council and take it up in full council since it is really a renewal of our existing lease.,82,,
450,0.97,4577.973,4600.862,"That is somewhat you will hear today, a discrimination of that lease agreement for those who have not been through this before for our five lease agreement deal so you can get the whole deal on what this is about but that is the summary of what you will hear today and why we are doing it the way we are doing it today.",82,,
451,0.97,4600.862,4601.83,Thank you very much.,83,,
452,0.97,4601.83,4602.264,"Thank you, Robin.",83,,
453,0.97,4602.264,4603.131,"Grandmother, Councilmember Mosqueda.",84,,
454,0.97,4603.131,4605.3,Thank you for the opportunity to be here this morning.,84,,
455,0.97,4605.3,4609.371,I think I will let the other members of the panel introduce themselves.,84,,
456,0.97,4609.371,4620.749,"I will for the record say I am Robin Koskey, the office of Intergovernmental relations director.",84,,
457,0.97,4620.749,4635.33,I am Jessica Gomez from the Department of housing and strategic policy and equitable development team in the office of housing.,85,,
458,0.97,4635.33,4639.101,Well it is good to see you.,86,,
459,0.97,4639.101,4642.537,Thank you for being here.,86,,
460,0.97,4642.537,4642.904,"Hello, Karen.",86,,
461,0.97,4642.904,4644.272,"Hello, good morning, everybody.",87,,
462,0.97,4644.272,4648.944,I am the interim chief operating officer at FAS.,87,,
463,0.97,4648.944,4653.081,I am Karen Gruen and I am happy to talk to the committee this morning.,87,,
464,0.97,4653.081,4654.783,I will be sharing my screen.,88,,
465,0.97,4654.783,4655.784,Are we ready to do that?,88,,
466,0.97,4655.784,4659.021,I think so.,89,,
467,0.97,4659.021,4659.221,Great.,90,,
468,0.97,4663.725,4687.015,"While Jessica is sharing her screen and getting the presentation ready, at Councilmember Mosqueda said, the city's vision for Fort Lawton that you are familiar with is to create an affordable, livable community which includes affordable housing in the magnolia neighborhood and recreational and open space for Seattle.",91,,
469,0.97,4687.015,4692.587,"A little Brown, for those of you who were not members of the Council at that time.",91,,
470,0.97,4692.587,4698.193,In 2019 the Fort Lawton redevelopment plan was Approveed by city council.,91,,
471,0.97,4698.193,4700.796,"On June 10, 2019, via resolution.",91,,
472,0.97,4700.796,4706.568,Then the city sub knitted a redevelopment plan to HUD in the office in 2019.,91,,
473,0.97,4706.568,4709.704,That somewhere we are are Preschoolly in the process.,91,,
474,0.97,4709.704,4719.247,"But as Tracy said, we are here to really discuss a if he can Cal matter of the lease renewal while we are working with HUD on approval of the Redevelopment plan.",91,,
475,0.97,4719.247,4721.85,We currently have a five year lease.,91,,
476,0.97,4721.85,4729.191,I think Jessica you could probably go to the next slide.,91,,
477,0.97,4729.191,4741.47,That lease Exfires at the end fire fires at the end of this--expires a the the end of this year.,91,,
478,0.97,4741.47,4751.246,"It is almost a 34-Acre site which is on the next slide, I believe.",91,,
479,0.97,4751.246,4754.549,And that is the location of the site a reminder to everyone.,91,,
480,0.97,4754.549,4762.657,We recognize you don't have the lease in front of you right now but it is is substantially similar to one in place right now.,91,,
481,0.97,4762.657,4770.031,First as serves as the custodial manager for the property and the costs are shared by the office of housing and the Seattle parks & amp; reaction.,91,,
482,0.97,4770.031,4777.038,Oar is just a partner in this project to make sure we are Movings this forward with our external partners.,91,,
483,0.97,4777.038,4780.008,I think that brief instruction is all I really have more today.,91,,
484,0.97,4780.008,4798.093,I will hand it over to Karen so she can talk to you about the particulars of the lease and the one year lease extensions before you,91,,
485,0.97,4798.093,4807.936,"As Robin mentioned, the city is on its fifth year of a Five- year lease for the Fort Lawton property.",92,,
486,0.97,4807.936,4810.005,This is substantially the same as the existing lease.,92,,
487,0.97,4810.005,4829.157,We are just coming off of the five year lease at the end of this year.,92,,
488,0.97,4829.157,4838.867,The renewal is for a four year and one year term renewals each up to a limit of five years.,92,,
489,0.97,4838.867,4850.145,The terms of the existing lease and the new lease call for the city to be the sole caretaker of the property.,92,,
490,0.97,4850.145,4852.881,"It is a vast property, nearly 34-Acres.",92,,
491,0.97,4852.881,4859.187,"The city maintains it, operates it and looks after the security and that is split.",92,,
492,0.97,4859.187,4865.76,The documents are currently in process with the U.S. Army as Tracy talked about.,92,,
493,0.97,4865.76,4876.571,And the U.S. Army in June of this year toured the property with FAS to conduct a site tour and property conditions review so it can issue an environmental report.,92,,
494,0.97,4876.571,4882.277,That is the last thing pending with the Army.,92,,
495,0.97,4882.277,4903.331,"They intend to finish their report later this fall, so what we wanted to do overall in the timing of this is brief the committee in September and then move into a full tunnel process for renewing the lease later this fall.",92,,
496,0.97,4903.331,4905.867,The environmental report will only effect sections 9C and 9D of the lease.,92,,
497,0.97,4905.867,4913.742,That has to do with bringing the parties current on the physical condition of the property and the environmental condition of the property.,92,,
498,0.97,4913.742,4917.545,"Again, we think that will issue very soon from the U.S. Army.",92,,
499,0.97,4917.545,4937.065,"The next slide gets into the--the final slide, but what we anticipate is FAS being able to sign the lease on or before December 1. that was a request to the city by the U.S. Army with a commencement date of the new lease on January 1, 2022.",92,,
500,0.97,4937.065,4947.943,"We are happy to take questions from the committee and with that I think that is our slide presentation, so we will move into questions.",92,,
501,0.97,4947.943,4950.879,"Well, thank you very much for the update.",93,,
502,0.97,4950.879,4958.253,I know the Fort Lawton issue has been around for many years so I really appreciate you providing the overview.,93,,
503,0.97,4958.253,4962.057,I will briefly summarize for those that are wondering what is happening today.,93,,
504,0.97,4962.057,4970.832,As a reminder we are are committed to the Fort Lawton vision to utilize the property currently own by the Army.,93,,
505,0.97,4970.832,4983.111,"There is a process in the works to create needed affordable housing, for rental opportunities, for existing wildlife habitat to be expanded and cared for.",93,,
506,0.97,4983.111,5004.099,"We are also opening up space on the property for there to be plain area for community, so this is a really great way to couple existing discovery park assets next to a more affordable housing as we are creating use of underutilized land, especially in an area like magnolia that has access to high opportunities.",93,,
507,0.97,5004.099,5012.474,We are excited about the future efforts on that land.,93,,
508,0.97,5012.474,5016.144,So the city currently has the lease from the Army.,93,,
509,0.97,5016.144,5047.809,"While we are wait are for approval for our plans on the site, we are hoping we can move forward with this lease today because I we don't move forward by extending our lease it will Exin December so the legislation in front of us essentially extends the lease agreement we currently have where the Army for the Fort Lawton property at discovery pork and we will continue to work to get the approval for redevelopment plans for Fort Lawton in working in partnership with the housing urban and development Department at the Federal level.",93,,
510,0.97,5047.809,5064.125,I want to thank the Department of housing for the work you have done on the legislation is you can have a lease agreement signed before the lease expires and the colleagues will again have a chance to have the actual legislation with us in full council.,93,,
511,0.97,5064.125,5073.068,"Thank you, Council President, for allows for that to be directly referred to full council.",93,,
512,0.97,5073.068,5081.142,Likely on September 27 and the--once we receive the last attachment to the finalized legislation we will make sure it all gets submitted.,93,,
513,0.97,5081.142,5086.114,"Tracy, do you want to add anything in terms of process so folks know what is coming up.",93,,
514,0.97,5086.114,5092.153,This is a briefing so we can ask any questions and we will have a possible vote on September 27 and full council.,93,,
515,0.97,5092.153,5093.721,"Anything to add to that, trace sunny.",93,,
516,0.97,5093.721,5094.322,Thank you.,94,,
517,0.97,5094.322,5101.262,We,94,,
518,0.97,5101.496,5123.251,"You will not see this put on the referral calendar and in front of you in full council until we get the last piece, and as I referred to, that is uncertain as to when the Army can cut loose that information and we can complete the agreement, so I don't anticipate that by 27 September at all.",95,,
519,0.97,5123.251,5127.989,"What I hear from our executive counterparts, it may be a few weeks.",95,,
520,0.97,5127.989,5140.735,"We will let all of you know when that is coming through for you all and make sure you are covered in briefings when it is coming to the full Council, but I appreciate being able to brief Councilmembers about that.",95,,
521,0.97,5140.735,5153.148,"One other thing, we are responsible for covering the costs of maintaining the property out there, so it does matter to us.",95,,
522,0.97,5153.148,5162.891,"There is about $700,000 per year between parks and the office of housing that has to do with covering security, drainage, maintenance of the buildings and so forth.",95,,
523,0.97,5162.891,5177.071,"So there is a cost to the city of continuing to be in this holding pattern and we are hopeful HUD will move on approval, so we can get out of this holding situation and move toward redevelopment.",95,,
524,0.97,5177.071,5191.319,"But I want to disclose to all of you that there is a cost we are experiencing as a result of having to maintain this property, with slight increases because of security cost and property management and so forth, so those will be covered in the budget.",95,,
525,0.97,5191.319,5192.153,"Any questions, colleagues?",96,,
526,0.97,5192.153,5195.423,Thank you for the update on the timing.,96,,
527,0.97,5195.423,5212.04,We look forward to being able to share with the public when we have received the last attachment we are waiting for for the legislation to be introduced and then we will make sure it is publicly announced when that will be considered at full council.,96,,
528,0.97,5212.04,5225.153,"If there are not additional questions, seeing none, I want to thank you for the briefing today and anything we can do to help expedite that process, we are all in, as you know.",96,,
529,0.97,5225.153,5227.455,"Thanks, colleagues.",96,,
530,0.97,5227.455,5228.256,Good to see you.,96,,
531,0.97,5228.256,5233.361,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",97,,
532,0.97,5233.361,5233.962,Wonderful.,98,,
533,0.97,5233.962,5235.63,Let's move into the fourth item on the agenda.,98,,
534,0.97,5235.63,5242.27,"Item number four, revenue forecast update, briefing and discussion.",99,,
535,0.97,5242.27,5245.173,"I see with us, Ben noble.",100,,
536,0.97,5245.173,5246.374,From the office of city budget.,100,,
537,0.97,5246.374,5250.044,"I also see Dave Hennes, good morning, Dave.",100,,
538,0.97,5250.044,5254.882,I do not see anyone else popping up.,100,,
539,0.97,5254.882,5256.15,"Oh, good morning.",100,,
540,0.97,5256.15,5260.588,I appreciate you coming back.,100,,
541,0.97,5260.588,5261.189,Good morning.,101,,
542,0.97,5261.189,5261.99,Thanks for coming.,102,,
543,0.97,5261.99,5273.401,"I know that we have had a chance to have the revenue forecast proposal in front of Committee in August, so I appreciate you coming back.",102,,
544,0.97,5273.401,5275.603,In that discussion we did here projected revenue at the time.,102,,
545,0.97,5275.603,5288.316,"We did ask that you consider making yourself available, so we can see if there was additional data that we might be able to look at as we anticipate the Mayor's proposed budget.",102,,
546,0.97,5288.316,5299.327,"Given the uncertainties of Covid and all the data we continue to track, we appreciate you being here to present any updates on the revenue forecast in our committee.",102,,
547,0.97,5299.327,5310.338,"We have a lot of appreciation for you giving your time, given that it is just over a week until that budget, so we know you are busy.",102,,
548,0.97,5310.338,5314.842,Thank you for being available today.,102,,
549,0.97,5314.842,5316.778,I will turn it over to director Ben noble.,102,,
550,0.97,5316.778,5319.047,"Thank you, I appreciate the opportunity.",103,,
551,0.97,5319.047,5329.857,"We will give you an update and I will run through a few slides, with JAN and Dave available to answer questions.",103,,
552,0.97,5329.857,5330.658,On the technical side.,103,,
553,0.97,5330.658,5335.963,"At a high level, we don't have anything large to report to you.",103,,
554,0.97,5335.963,5338.866,"On a quantitative basis, some small changes.",103,,
555,0.97,5338.866,5353.214,"Qualitatively, concerns around Delta remain, but essentially it has been a month and the overall tenor and perspective on the forecast is unchanged.",103,,
556,0.97,5353.214,5361.556,We do want to show you some of the additional information we have.,103,,
557,0.97,5361.556,5367.128,"You can see how the risks, potential risks to the forecast have played out from that time and what we see looking forward.",103,,
558,0.97,5367.128,5374.168,I am going to share my screen and put up some slides here.,103,,
559,0.97,5374.168,5379.006,One second while I execute that.,103,,
560,0.97,5379.006,5388.382,I am going to try to get this to full screen.,103,,
561,0.97,5388.382,5389.183,One more try at that.,103,,
562,0.97,5389.183,5392.52,There we go.,103,,
563,0.97,5392.52,5410.738,"So again, one thing we can report on is additional months of sales tax and on the next slide, business and occupation tax and show you how those compared to the August forecast.",103,,
564,0.97,5410.738,5414.342,We have a baseline for that.,103,,
565,0.97,5414.342,5428.756,"Overall as indicated for the first two quarters, we collected just under $130 million post sales tax and that is relative to the August forecast, just slightly below.",103,,
566,0.97,5428.756,5434.629,"$200,000, $0.2 million.",103,,
567,0.97,5434.629,5439.0,A slight variation from forecast.,103,,
568,0.97,5439.0,5441.969,"Month-to-month, not at all unusual.",103,,
569,0.97,5441.969,5449.477,"I would note that relative to 2019, in nominal terms, we are getting close to that same level.",103,,
570,0.97,5449.477,5452.547,Sales tax returning to Pre- pandemic levels.,103,,
571,0.97,5452.547,5462.29,"We know there have been a couple years of inflation since then and relatively high inflation, but the purchasing power of the revenue is not quite what they were.",103,,
572,0.97,5462.29,5465.159,But obviously good news.,103,,
573,0.97,5465.159,5471.399,"You can see in detail on the right, differences in key sectors in terms of 2019 versus 2021.",103,,
574,0.97,5471.399,5484.879,"I am not going to comment except to note, no surprise, the biggest negative impact in comparing 2019 and 2021 are in leisure and hospitality.",103,,
575,0.97,5484.879,5489.517,So that is the sales tax side.,103,,
576,0.97,5489.517,5494.856,"So relative to forecast, pretty solid.",103,,
577,0.97,5494.856,5499.293,"Business occupation tax, the first two quarters of the year.",103,,
578,0.97,5499.293,5511.239,"Payments just over $134 million and in this case we are slightly above forecast, about $1 million above forecast.",103,,
579,0.97,5511.239,5512.073,These data come in quarterly.,103,,
580,0.97,5512.073,5514.909,"I'm reporting monthly, but the bulk of our quarterly.",103,,
581,0.97,5514.909,5516.21,"Small variations, not a surprise.",103,,
582,0.97,5516.21,5521.249,"Note that we are slightly below 2019 revenue, but not dramatically so.",103,,
583,0.97,5521.249,5528.923,"Again, leisure and hospitality are where we are seeing a loss of revenue.",103,,
584,0.97,5528.923,5537.698,"The information sector and financial services, we are actually ahead of where we were in 2021 in nominal terms and probably adjusting for inflation as well.",103,,
585,0.97,5537.698,5545.539,"Again, actual received revenue since we last saw you, direct to the forecast, which is good news.",103,,
586,0.97,5545.539,5552.446,"That said, Delta remains the obvious risk.",103,,
587,0.97,5552.446,5557.551,"You can see, these are case counts.",103,,
588,0.97,5557.551,5559.854,You can interpret them.,103,,
589,0.97,5559.854,5564.258,We are not in the medical profession.,103,,
590,0.97,5564.258,5569.764,Probably the key concerns now are about additional restrictions that are imposed.,103,,
591,0.97,5569.764,5582.977,"We will talk about that in just a second, in terms of limiting people's ability to go out and participate in the economy, particularly around travel and recreation and the like.",103,,
592,0.97,5582.977,5588.416,Also Supply-Chain interruptions.,103,,
593,0.97,5588.416,5597.792,We continue to hear and there are documented instances of manufacturing being impacted by the lack of key inputs.,103,,
594,0.97,5597.792,5598.793,"In that case, computer chips.",103,,
595,0.97,5598.793,5608.936,"The other thing is sort of the psychology of this and concerned about where the economy may be headed, may lead people to be more cautious.",103,,
596,0.97,5608.936,5627.855,"That said, overall, the economy and those of us participating in it seem to have adapted to those kinds of risks and there is a sense that Covid is really having an impact, but perhaps not as large as initially feared by many.",103,,
597,0.97,5627.855,5631.826,"Economic behavior, not as dramatically Impacting as we might've thought.",103,,
598,0.97,5631.826,5639.166,"Again, I will show you additional information on travel and dining in just a second.",103,,
599,0.97,5639.166,5648.175,"Another point, on the good news front, we are continuing to see employment recover.",103,,
600,0.97,5648.175,5658.285,"A lot of information here, but the top two bars, the blue and red, show the change in employment, first in June and then in August.",103,,
601,0.97,5658.285,5662.99,"What you are saying, these are negative numbers, because we lost so many jobs.",103,,
602,0.97,5662.99,5666.193,But you see we have added jobs since June.,103,,
603,0.97,5666.193,5670.464,"10,004 the metropolitan district.",103,,
604,0.97,5670.464,5671.298,Metropolitan area.,103,,
605,0.97,5671.298,5675.903,So we are continuing to build employment.,103,,
606,0.97,5675.903,5681.275,"Again, concerns remain, but that is good news.",103,,
607,0.97,5681.275,5686.013,It was a slight downward revision and overall employment for June.,103,,
608,0.97,5686.013,5688.916,"Not ideal, but not necessarily that significant.",103,,
609,0.97,5688.916,5698.125,"Again, continuing to see the recovery that we anticipate going forward and it is assumed in the forecast.",103,,
610,0.97,5698.125,5707.935,"I did mention we want to show you some information about travel and dining, which does suggest some of the impacts of Delta.",103,,
611,0.97,5707.935,5713.707,"These are Trendlines, on the left in red, hotel occupancy.",103,,
612,0.97,5713.707,5719.447,The other is essentially airplane landings for travelers through Seatac.,103,,
613,0.97,5719.447,5724.618,"And on the right, restaurants.",103,,
614,0.97,5724.618,5725.92,"Attendance, if you will.",103,,
615,0.97,5725.92,5732.059,The green is Seattle.,103,,
616,0.97,5732.059,5742.636,"The blue is the U.S. as a whole and what you see is a pattern of recovery for much of 2020, but it appears that the recovery has Plateaued over the last couple of months, July and August.",103,,
617,0.97,5742.636,5745.873,The Trendlines have moved up.,103,,
618,0.97,5745.873,5754.148,"Again, that is consistent with what we know about concerns around Delta and the like.",103,,
619,0.97,5754.148,5764.759,"That suggests some of the risks we are facing, but we are not seeing these as necessarily dramatic or overly concerning.",103,,
620,0.97,5764.759,5768.195,It is interesting on the restaurant side.,103,,
621,0.97,5768.195,5782.409,"Sales as a whole, we sought a bigger drop and a slower recovery, which I think speaks to what I regard to is the appropriate cautious regard we are taking around social distancing and the like.",103,,
622,0.97,5782.409,5786.28,"That is where the level of those lines are different, even though the trends are similar.",103,,
623,0.97,5786.28,5787.314,I do see a question.,103,,
624,0.97,5787.314,5789.316,I am happy to take it.,103,,
625,0.97,5789.316,5792.987,Thank you.,104,,
626,0.97,5792.987,5795.422,Council president and then vice chair Herbold.,104,,
627,0.97,5795.422,5805.599,I was going to ask that question that director Ben noble ended with.,105,,
628,0.97,5805.599,5807.635,Seated Diners at restaurants.,105,,
629,0.97,5807.635,5818.145,"It sounds like you all did not take into account in creating this chart, sort of the regional differences.",105,,
630,0.97,5818.145,5830.758,"The very hyper local differences in indoor dining restrictions that play out in our jurisdiction, versus across the country.",105,,
631,0.97,5830.758,5835.229,"Which as we know, there was a lot of variety there.",105,,
632,0.97,5835.229,5839.833,This is sort of just like taking the data as is without restrictions?,105,,
633,0.97,5839.833,5860.387,"It is measured in percentage terms, so we all dropped off very dramatically in March and then the U.S., tracking the blue line, the country as a whole, dining has returned at a more rapid rate than here.",106,,
634,0.97,5860.387,5863.691,So percentage is relative to before the pandemic.,106,,
635,0.97,5863.691,5871.599,We are seeing less restaurant use.,106,,
636,0.97,5871.599,5874.401,I will be right back to you.,106,,
637,0.97,5874.401,5878.906,Sorry.,106,,
638,0.97,5878.906,5879.373,The world continues.,106,,
639,0.97,5879.373,5880.107,It sure does.,107,,
640,0.97,5880.107,5883.11,I appreciate your forbearance.,108,,
641,0.97,5883.11,5886.78,No excuses necessary with this audience.,109,,
642,0.97,5886.78,5889.884,Understood and deeply appreciated.,110,,
643,0.97,5889.884,5893.721,Recording stopped.,111,,
644,0.97,5893.721,5894.521,"Hold on, please.",112,,
645,0.97,5894.521,5897.791,Everyone heard that announcement.,112,,
646,0.97,5897.791,5899.627,"Sorry about that, I don't know what happened.",113,,
647,0.97,5899.627,5906.734,"For those watching us on Seattle Channel, which I assume is still Broadcasting --",114,,
648,0.97,5906.734,5908.135,Recording in progress.,115,,
649,0.97,5908.135,5909.737,Wonderful.,116,,
650,0.97,5909.737,5911.005,We just paused.,116,,
651,0.97,5911.005,5931.959,"If there was a Glitch in the matrix--if there was a Glitch in the reporting, please note that we did not continue the meeting while the recording was paused, so we did have a chance to have the question and director noble, you were starting to answer.",116,,
652,0.97,5931.959,5934.161,"You also were interrupted, so let's go back to you.",116,,
653,0.97,5934.161,5945.339,"Just again, in the U.S. is all there is more activity, reflective of the difference in approaches taken toward social distancing and Covid restrictions generally.",117,,
654,0.97,5945.339,5948.976,Thank you.,118,,
655,0.97,5948.976,5951.645,Vice chair Herbold.,119,,
656,0.97,5951.645,5952.046,Thanks.,120,,
657,0.97,5952.046,5954.682,I am just curious.,120,,
658,0.97,5954.682,5972.166,"Obviously travel recovery and the segment of the economy related to restaurants and hospitality, is super important to our overall recovery.",120,,
659,0.97,5972.166,5980.007,Can you just talk a little bit about why these two indicators--not these two indicators.,120,,
660,0.97,5980.007,5992.286,"Indicators for these two sectors are the ones we are focusing on, as opposed to the other sectors that are important to Seattle's economy and our recovery?",120,,
661,0.97,5992.286,6007.634,Because with these we are concerned in particular that the rising Delta issues will play out and they are the ones continuing to lag.,121,,
662,0.97,6007.634,6018.245,"This feels like the core of the risk, because much of the rest of the economy has adapted, if you will.",121,,
663,0.97,6018.245,6022.75,I will make a plug for arts and entertainment.,122,,
664,0.97,6022.75,6024.752,"Measuring that as well, because I feel that is huge.",122,,
665,0.97,6024.752,6032.926,"We have learned a lot about how much of a driver that is, specifically for Seattle's economy, as compared to other cities.",122,,
666,0.97,6032.926,6036.563,It is a much higher percentage of our GDP than other cities.,122,,
667,0.97,6036.563,6038.966,A very good point.,123,,
668,0.97,6038.966,6041.635,These are Metrics that are easily available.,123,,
669,0.97,6041.635,6050.277,We can take a look and Dave may know whether there are Metrics for those sorts of activities.,123,,
670,0.97,6050.277,6061.889,"One thing that comes to mind, seasonal sports are about to gear up and from an economic perspective, an important element.",123,,
671,0.97,6061.889,6073.133,"So we can take a look for those kinds of Metrics and see what we are seeing there and check those as well, that is a good point.",123,,
672,0.97,6073.133,6077.004,I have one last slide that highlights changes at the national level and there are lots of numbers.,123,,
673,0.97,6077.004,6086.914,"Again, reminding you that the way we build our model is to take forecasting from the national level and use it to input in our regional model.",123,,
674,0.97,6086.914,6096.023,What I have with these numbers are showing you the difference between the inputs we used in July and the same forecast for September.,123,,
675,0.97,6096.023,6105.399,"What you see, consistent with concerns around Delta and the like, the National forecast is down slightly.",123,,
676,0.97,6105.399,6109.636,They are predicting slightly less employment for 2021 and 2022.,123,,
677,0.97,6109.636,6118.011,Retail sales are expected more in 2021 than they were in July.,123,,
678,0.97,6118.011,6123.25,I think that is consistent with what we described in August.,123,,
679,0.97,6123.25,6127.855,The Federal stimulus landed more effectively and dramatically in 2021 than had been anticipated.,123,,
680,0.97,6127.855,6133.427,"These differences are very small, less than 1%.",123,,
681,0.97,6133.427,6145.372,"Again, confirming the mood of the economy and the forecast has been tempered somewhat in the past month, but we don't think significantly.",123,,
682,0.97,6145.372,6155.582,"So we will have yet again another month of additional data before we provide the update in late October or early November, depending on the precise timing.",123,,
683,0.97,6155.582,6161.989,The formal update will include a quantitative forecast that will underlie your decisions.,123,,
684,0.97,6161.989,6167.161,It suggests that the forecast will not be going up.,123,,
685,0.97,6167.161,6168.662,It might be a small downward revision.,123,,
686,0.97,6168.662,6193.987,"I would NOTE on that front, we have constructed the budget and as we are dotting I's and crossing tease, there was a recognition that there may be softness in the revenue and the proposal would include discretionary items that could be deferred and these will be your choices, clearly.",123,,
687,0.97,6193.987,6204.331,"If there is less revenue, you could make decisions to defer discretionary items and in doing so there would not be a cut to city services, things we are providing to the public.",123,,
688,0.97,6204.331,6209.036,There would not be a reduction in city employment.,123,,
689,0.97,6209.036,6222.849,I think there is room to absorb some reduction in the revenue forecast that should come without significant policy implications at least in the near term.,123,,
690,0.97,6222.849,6227.921,So we will keep you posted and also central staff as well.,123,,
691,0.97,6227.921,6236.63,"And again, we will be back in just over a month from now with the formal update.",123,,
692,0.97,6236.63,6237.431,Thanks so much.,124,,
693,0.97,6237.431,6244.538,I do have a handful of questions and I also want to welcome our budget lead to the line.,124,,
694,0.97,6244.538,6253.68,"If you have questions or comments, please feel free to jump in and take yourself off mute any time.",124,,
695,0.97,6253.68,6257.351,"Also available for us, the legislative body, to ask questions about.",124,,
696,0.97,6257.351,6261.588,If you could actually keep that up for one more second.,124,,
697,0.97,6261.588,6262.756,"So, a few questions.",124,,
698,0.97,6262.756,6278.472,"First, in slide four, you listed the factors that have gone into creating the data, looking at Seattle-based data, but in subsequent slides you compared to trends in the rest of the country.",124,,
699,0.97,6278.472,6283.31,Do you have similar data or factors you are looking at that compare us to the rest of the country?,124,,
700,0.97,6283.31,6288.215,And if you could pull that backup for us.,124,,
701,0.97,6288.215,6292.886,"By slide four, you mean this one?",125,,
702,0.97,6292.886,6293.92,"Oh, I am not sharing.",125,,
703,0.97,6293.92,6299.993,"Sorry, I thought I was.",125,,
704,0.97,6299.993,6301.028,I was doing really well.,125,,
705,0.97,6301.028,6302.229,You are doing really well.,126,,
706,0.97,6302.229,6308.035,"Hang on, let me get there again.",127,,
707,0.97,6308.035,6310.537,I'm sorry.,127,,
708,0.97,6310.537,6318.845,I will get there.,127,,
709,0.97,6318.845,6327.254,I have too many windows open.,127,,
710,0.97,6329.99,6332.025,"Yes, that is the one.",128,,
711,0.97,6332.025,6338.765,Thank you.,128,,
712,0.97,6338.765,6343.67,You are okay.,128,,
713,0.97,6343.67,6351.845,"So, we can certainly pull that together.",129,,
714,0.97,6351.845,6355.849,I do not know what to tell you.,129,,
715,0.97,6355.849,6361.955,The National trends around Caseloads and the like.,129,,
716,0.97,6361.955,6375.168,"It is comparable, though more alarming in some communities and we are seeing a significant rise in case counts and hospitalizations.",129,,
717,0.97,6375.168,6376.169,"Again, I am not a doctor.",129,,
718,0.97,6376.169,6383.877,"Well, I am a doctor, but not that kind of doctor.",129,,
719,0.97,6383.877,6388.648,"In mortality and most recently, increasing cases among children as they return to the classroom.",129,,
720,0.97,6388.648,6432.225,"I think it is important for us to see those trends across the nation and I appreciate you including the U.S. comparison to Seattle's data and the subsequent slides, because while Seattle is concerned and public health Seattle King County has been reacting Proactively along with the governor of Washington State to the crises that we are seeing in our local region, we also know that our economy is affected by these factors at the national level and in many cases we are seeing growing rates across the country of Covid cases and really concerned with the hospitalization rates.",130,,
721,0.97,6432.225,6450.877,"I am worried that we are going uses baseline revenue Udget protections, projections, when we could be potentially building a more conservative budget around the pessimistic forecast.",130,,
722,0.97,6450.877,6465.892,So is there any economic data or is there a potential future upside that we should be thinking about to avoid having to not just look at where there is--what was the word that you used?,130,,
723,0.97,6465.892,6466.993,Discretionary Fund.,130,,
724,0.97,6466.993,6480.373,"All of this is still, frankly, as you noted, up to the discretion of the city council.",130,,
725,0.97,6480.373,6505.932,So we will be in a position to have to rearrange the budget to address potential Downsides in the midst of receiving another economic forecast in November and I am worried that the trends we are seeing on this slide Showcases of Covid and hospitalizations that are rivaling the most concerning peak at the end of last year.,130,,
726,0.97,6505.932,6511.638,"How we reconcile drafting a budget prior to receiving that information in November, with the anticipation for these cases to continue to move forwards?",130,,
727,0.97,6511.638,6515.909,I recognize the concern.,131,,
728,0.97,6515.909,6539.966,"From a forecast perspective, the quantitative information we have available and the underlying economic forecast, what we have seen as the Delta variance and case counts have increased in the past months, we have not seen a dramatic slowdown.",131,,
729,0.97,6539.966,6546.773,"The economy seems to be moving forward Nonetheless, if you will.",131,,
730,0.97,6546.773,6560.287,"I don't pretend to know that that would be the case going forward, but I try to be as subjective as we can, given the information we are provided at the national level.",131,,
731,0.97,6560.287,6568.895,"Again, we have not seen a significant change over the past month.",131,,
732,0.97,6568.895,6570.764,I don't know what else to tell you.,131,,
733,0.97,6570.764,6575.068,"We will continue to monitor, as will you.",131,,
734,0.97,6575.068,6581.408,"Again, these will be your choices as the budget process proceeds.",131,,
735,0.97,6581.408,6599.592,"If there is a significant downturn in revenues, know that we will be partners in helping you manage that reality, if you will, and adjustments that would need to be made.",131,,
736,0.97,6599.592,6602.228,"Okay, thanks so much, director noble.",132,,
737,0.97,6602.228,6605.498,Are there additional questions?,132,,
738,0.97,6605.498,6609.135,"And again, Dave and Jan, I appreciate you being here.",132,,
739,0.97,6609.135,6613.94,With a final creation of the budget and all that CBO is doing currently.,132,,
740,0.97,6613.94,6616.843,Is there anything else you would add?,132,,
741,0.97,6616.843,6622.549,"Chair Mosqueda, can I jump in?",133,,
742,0.97,6622.549,6623.149,Of course.,134,,
743,0.97,6623.149,6624.351,Please go ahead.,134,,
744,0.97,6624.351,6625.151,Thank you.,135,,
745,0.97,6625.151,6630.657,I would reiterate or say a different way.,135,,
746,0.97,6630.657,6636.763,"Chair Mosqueda, you are just pointing at and director noble was highlighting there is a lot of uncertainty.",135,,
747,0.97,6636.763,6656.883,"From my perspective as we go into the fall budget deliberations, given the downward variables, the increased probability of the pessimistic scenario and a lot of unknowns about recent announcements on response like mandates and increased Caseloads will affect things.",135,,
748,0.97,6656.883,6706.933,"I think there is a good possibility that the November forecast may reduce resources available for the 2022 budget or may hold steady and it is hard to predict, as director noble pointed out, but I will highlight more broadly, some discretionary decisions I think you will be facing, in 2020 because of the impact of Covid, the city had to significantly tap its emergency reserves to support ongoing services and the Council was able to replenish some of those emergency reserves last year, but it is likely that if there is a downward turn for the November forecast, we will be looking at having to reduce whatever is in the Mayor's proposed budget in terms of those reserves, which increases risks next year if trends continue.",135,,
749,0.97,6706.933,6713.139,We will have less resources available if trends continue to go down.,135,,
750,0.97,6713.139,6718.845,"I am pointing out as we go into budget deliberations, the Council will be faced potentially with hard choices.",135,,
751,0.97,6718.845,6730.457,"How to plan for future potential emergency issues, as well as addressing Council priorities that may not be included in the proposed budget.",135,,
752,0.97,6730.457,6762.489,"So this is just ground setting for discussions of the proposed budget and I work with director noble and his team to consider when and how frequently we are updating some of this information to inform those decisions and it will be particularly critical as Councilmembers consider what changes they want to propose to the Mayor's proposed budget, as well as when you are putting the package together and the choices being made about resource availability.",135,,
753,0.97,6762.489,6762.889,Thanks.,136,,
754,0.97,6762.889,6766.359,Just to state it a different way.,136,,
755,0.97,6766.359,6776.503,"I think you are saying a lot of different things, but one of the things I thought I heard and correct me if I am not hearing you correctly.",136,,
756,0.97,6776.503,6799.292,"What I am thinking I am hearing is the executive shares the goal of the Council, of preserving our emergency funds for future use and creating long-term Sustainability around our emergency funds.",136,,
757,0.97,6799.292,6807.734,It might make more sense to be budgeting using the pessimistic forecast.,136,,

759,0.97,6810.436,6819.145,"In order to meet the goal of creating Sustainability, long- term Sustainability for the emergency funds.",136,,
760,0.97,6819.145,6837.03,"Yes, thank you for saying that more succinctly, but I would also note that there is a practical reality of when this information is available and the city and the Mayor putting the proposed budget together, so I also want to acknowledge that reality.",137,,
761,0.97,6837.03,6856.983,"But yes, we will have to be looking at those choices of sort of looking at the proposed budget and reducing certain services or proposed new spending rather than any contribution to the service for that long-term Sustainability.",137,,
762,0.97,6856.983,6859.986,"Thank you, vice chair.",138,,

768,0.97,6889.682,6913.339,"Since the baseline scenario has been chosen by the Mayor and there is less certainty around that projection at this point, I think it is possible as has been noted by the vice chair and Allie and director noble, that there will continue to be a downward trajectory for future forecasts and that will not occur until November.",138,,

772,0.97,6930.49,6951.678,"We look forward to continuing to work with you, members of the CBO and future forecast Council to help identify the most recent information we can draw upon as we draw up this budget and again, I want to make sure we have the budget that is able to invest in our values and is accurate in its use of future projected revenue.",138,,

774,0.97,6955.081,6965.725,"And perhaps we can also see if there is additional information, periodically, throughout the process, so we are not just anticipating the November forecast.",138,,
775,0.97,6965.725,6974.267,"But I welcome the opportunity to work with you as you receive updated information, locally and nationally.",138,,
776,0.97,6974.267,6986.779,"As information both unrealized revenues are reported to us and also forecast information, we have a distribution list that includes central staff.",139,,
777,0.97,6986.779,6993.419,We are also expected to be in dialogue over the next month and a half as we continue our work.,139,,
778,0.97,6993.419,6997.123,"Okay, thank you so much.",140,,
