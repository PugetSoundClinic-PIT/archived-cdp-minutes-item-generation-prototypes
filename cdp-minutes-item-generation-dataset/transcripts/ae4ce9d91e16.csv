50,0.97,323.356,323.89,"Good morning, colleagues.",21,,
51,0.97,323.89,334.901,I'd like to welcome back our Seattle Department of transportation and thank them for their work to stabilize the West Seattle bridge while they plan for repairing and replacing that vital infrastructure.,21,,
52,0.97,334.901,348.614,Sdot's managing that crisis on top of running their vast Department with over 1000 employees and multiple on going construction contracts as they make improvements throughout Seattle even during the pandemic.,21,,
53,0.97,348.614,359.625,"In addition to the weekly updates that we all received via E-mail, we had more formal briefings from Sdot in April.",21,,
54,0.97,359.625,367.5,We decided this week was timely for another larger update as the Mayor gets closer to a decision on whether to repair or replace.,21,,
55,0.97,367.5,370.403,There's no immediate legislative action the Council is required to take.,21,,
56,0.97,370.403,385.384,Earlier this year the city council authorized most of the financing necessary for the initial traffic mid mitigation and to stabilize the high bridge because we need to stabilize the high bridge whether we repair or replace it.,21,,
57,0.97,385.384,393.426,The Mayor this morning Encolonelled encouraged us to provide individual input.,21,,
58,0.97,393.426,408.841,"The West Seattle bridge is a critical piece of infrastructure not only for the 100,000 residents of West Seattle but for our region and nation considering the importance of the port of Seattle.",21,,
59,0.97,408.841,414.981,Over the last few months Council member Herbold and I have been attending the meetings of a community task force.,21,,
60,0.97,414.981,419.952,A diverse 30 member task force dedicated to providing input on this project.,21,,
61,0.97,419.952,435.401,These task force members have participated in over a dozen meetings and spent numerous hours reviewing material and I just want to acknowledge and thank those volunteers for their dedication to this project to their communities and region.,21,,
62,0.97,435.401,445.478,Is a want to thank Calvin chow who has had to track this issue and keep us informed all the while doing other projects and the city budget as well.,21,,
63,0.97,445.478,458.858,So in addition Council member Herbold and I have been meeting to monitor and ask questions about the progress.,21,,
64,0.97,458.858,481.047,"As we await a decision from the Mayor on repair or replace, the presentation today will be an opportunity to bring everybody up to speed on what actions Sdot has taken to date to stabilize the bridge, prepare for the repair or replace decision.",21,,
65,0.97,481.047,496.362,"We're excited Council President Gonzalez acknowledged this too about voters renewing the Seattle transportation benefit district even though bus Ridership is down sharply, the needs have increased around West Seattle with the high bridge loaded.",21,,
66,0.97,496.362,503.569,"The new funding recognized the needs of West Seattle during this crisis, as well as support for infrastructure, maintenance and capital improvements across our city.",21,,
67,0.97,503.569,507.273,Thank you for allowing many he to have these opening remarks.,21,,
68,0.97,507.273,510.076,Going to hear from Council member Herbold now.,21,,
69,0.97,510.076,516.949,"Thank you so much, council member Pedersen for these introductory remarks.",22,,
70,0.97,516.949,522.021,Want to provide Council member Herbold an opportunity to also share some words with us.,22,,
71,0.97,522.021,522.488,Please.,22,,
72,0.97,522.488,524.09,Thank you.,23,,
73,0.97,524.09,525.157,I'll keep it real short.,23,,
74,0.97,525.157,529.428,Chair Pedersen did a great job of providing background and context.,23,,
75,0.97,529.428,575.341,"I want to also echo the thanks that chair Pedersen gave to Sdot for their managing of this crisis both as it relates to working with community to managing the technical advisory panel to developing the West Seattle, the Reconnect West Seattle plan working really diligently to address the severe needs for communities living in the Detour routes and addressing the traffic and congestion and safety, pedestrian safety and driver safety needs in those areas.",23,,
76,0.97,575.341,580.212,Their dedication and focus has been really appreciated.,23,,
77,0.97,580.212,588.287,As well as also managing the process with the community in determining what our next steps are.,23,,
78,0.97,588.287,605.237,"Since the closure of the West Seattle bridge on March 23rd, the impact has been felt very strongly in district 1 as the council member representing district 1 I hear every someday from residents and businesses that are hurting.",23,,
79,0.97,605.237,619.552,Once social distancing ends or decreases traffic and access issues will only increase and likely very dramatically.,23,,
80,0.97,619.552,621.354,The sooner we restore the bridge the better.,23,,
81,0.97,621.354,624.69,That is the premium value for me.,23,,
82,0.97,624.69,628.928,The bridge is a critical regional accent.,23,,
83,0.97,628.928,638.537,Integrally linked to our Maritime economy and the port of Seattle with links that go Inland throughout the state and beyond.,23,,
84,0.97,638.537,659.425,Like Council member Pedersen I hope that the Federal election may assist with Federal funding and I'm really encouraged by the attention from Congresswoman and our senators who have been very supportive of the city desserts.,23,,
85,0.97,659.425,660.326,I've met with Sdot regularly.,23,,
86,0.97,660.326,665.231,Participated as a member of the West Seattle bridge task force.,23,,
87,0.97,665.231,669.835,"Which has met 12 times, including during the last four weeks as well.",23,,
88,0.97,669.835,681.247,In late November the members of the task force provided the recommendations to the Mayor on whether to repair or replace the West Seattle bridge and the decision is in her hands.,23,,
89,0.97,681.247,688.354,"Our recommendations so Council members understand have not, is not a consensus opinion from the task force.",23,,
90,0.97,688.354,693.225,There is I think a wide spectrum of perspectives.,23,,
91,0.97,693.225,711.544,So individually we have been providing our feedback to the task force which will then be compiled and presented to the Mayor.,23,,
92,0.97,711.544,730.129,"Opportunity for us this morning is for Council to get up to speed, ask questions and again, as we've heard from the deputy Mayor this morning the Mayor is interested in Council feedback as well.",23,,
93,0.97,730.129,732.531,With that I have no further comments.,23,,
94,0.97,732.531,734.767,Looking forward to hearing from our friends at Sdot.,23,,
95,0.97,734.767,739.772,Thank you for those comments as well.,24,,
96,0.97,739.772,743.209,Really do appreciate the opportunity to get a in depth briefing once again.,24,,
97,0.97,743.209,749.215,I think this is the third Maybe the fourth time Sdot has been with us in Council briefing.,24,,
98,0.97,749.215,757.59,Excited about the opportunity to dig into the work that you all have done thus far.,24,,
99,0.97,757.59,771.837,Do sincerely appreciate the offer from the Mayor to get a broader set of input and guidance from the Council on this really important infrastructure issue.,24,,
100,0.97,771.837,777.143,Really looking forward to getting up to speed here.,24,,
101,0.97,777.143,781.313,"Sam, do you want to kick us off?",24,,
102,0.97,781.313,784.85,Then I can share the presentation.,24,,
103,0.97,784.85,785.217,Sure.,25,,
104,0.97,785.217,786.452,So I'm Sam Zimbabwe.,25,,
105,0.97,786.452,787.653,Director of Sdot.,25,,
106,0.97,787.653,811.076,"With me today is heather Marx who has been leading up the whole program of efforts that you'll hear about this morning and she's going to do the bulk of the talking and then Shawna Larson is here leading the charge on sharing the Powerpoint today, but also Lyasing with Council on this and any other issues you all have with Sdot.",25,,
107,0.97,811.076,814.146,So why don't you bring up the presentation.,25,,
108,0.97,814.146,820.686,We've got a lot to cover and I know that there's going to be a lot of questions.,25,,
109,0.97,820.686,827.86,I would encourage questions as we go if there are Clarifications or things Maybe we can hold those till the end.,25,,
110,0.97,827.86,830.896,I defer on how you'd like to handle that.,25,,
111,0.97,830.896,834.166,I just want to thank you all for the opportunity to be here.,25,,
112,0.97,834.166,840.005,It has been quite a while since we've been in front of the full Council to talk about where we are.,25,,
113,0.97,840.005,843.809,"As we get started, I'll give a little bit of introduction.",25,,
114,0.97,843.809,848.681,Heather's going to take us through the bulk of it.,25,,
115,0.97,848.681,858.557,"When we talk about the West Seattle high bridge program as a whole, it's both our efforts on the bridge and in the community to mitigate the impact of this.",25,,
116,0.97,858.557,873.072,I want to thank Council members Pedersen and Herbold for their tireless support and engagement in this throughout the process as well as we go through all of the work that's here.,25,,
117,0.97,873.072,884.75,I think Council member Pedersen has highlighted the need for focus not just on the West Seattle bridge but all of our bridges and our maintenance needs as a city.,25,,
118,0.97,884.75,893.058,"Council member Herbold has been engaged with the West Seattle community and South Park community, the whole valley that is feeling the impact.",25,,
119,0.97,893.058,896.362,I think their engagement has made our work better as a whole.,25,,
120,0.97,896.362,903.269,I also want to reiterate the thanks for the West Seattle bridge community task force.,25,,
121,0.97,903.269,925.19,"That is a number of people who have been giving lots of time in the midst of a very stressful time to really help us channel the viewpoints of the community here, feedback, understand where we have questions, both about the mitigation efforts that are underway and about the infrastructure decisions that are before us.",25,,
122,0.97,925.19,952.017,I'll say that we recognize this has been tremendously stressful time that the West Seattle bridge has only added to the potential impacts and we are working with speed and urgency to restore travel across the Duwamish.,25,,
123,0.97,952.017,957.956,Westbound and essential workers.,25,,
124,0.97,957.956,958.357,Local businesses.,25,,
125,0.97,958.357,958.724,City services.,25,,
126,0.97,958.724,961.126,"Maritime community manufacturing, we've all felt these impacts.",25,,
127,0.97,961.126,972.237,I know those are being felt throughout the community many folks who I didn't mention there and really this would only happen once.,25,,
128,0.97,972.237,975.975,This would only be something that happens this one time.,25,,
129,0.97,975.975,1002.167,"We have not passed up a single moment in advancing our options even when folks hear about a decision before us, we're not losing any time or speed in the effort to move forward on repair or replace and be able to restore this transportation connection as quickly as possible.",25,,
130,0.97,1002.167,1007.072,Public safety and equity have been at the forefront of what we have Prioritized as a department.,25,,
131,0.97,1007.072,1015.914,When we took this difficult decision to close the bridge back in Martha was because of the rapidly accelerating crack growth.,25,,
132,0.97,1015.914,1023.789,We are now and we'll talk about this morning coming to the end of the first stabilization efforts that we've put into place.,25,,
133,0.97,1023.789,1026.925,Those were not the result of a lack of maintenance.,25,,
134,0.97,1026.925,1035.1,We've done everything that we've had to from a maintenance perspective and that has meant we have all of these options still in front of us.,25,,
135,0.97,1035.1,1043.909,It's also the work that you'll see and you'll hear about was not possible when the bridge was open.,25,,
136,0.97,1043.909,1055.621,"As we had to respond to this need, regardless of whether it was planned or unplanned the bridge would have had to close to put into place the stabilization Effectives that are before us now.",25,,
137,0.97,1055.621,1059.725,We have a lot of material.,25,,
138,0.97,1059.725,1060.692,I'm going to stop there.,25,,
139,0.97,1060.692,1076.508,I'll Interject Maybe if there's anything to add but heather has been giving this presentation and things like it all across the Duwamish Valley communities for months on end and has all of the information to provide an update for the Council.,25,,
140,0.97,1076.508,1079.845,With that I will turn it over to heather.,25,,
141,0.97,1079.845,1098.13,"I'll just say, actually, before I do, what's changed since late April, these bullets list that out but we've declared the bridge an emergency the first time that we know of that a piece of infrastructure has been the subject of an emergency declaration.",25,,
142,0.97,1098.13,1101.6,We've done a whole range of community engagement.,25,,
143,0.97,1101.6,1103.368,We'll talk more about that.,25,,
144,0.97,1103.368,1107.84,We've done almost 200 specific traffic and Detour route improvements.,25,,
145,0.97,1107.84,1112.077,Worked to advance funding and get a handle on what funding will be necessary.,25,,
146,0.97,1112.077,1126.058,We've completed a cost benefit analysis which tries to look equally at all of the options on the table while we continue to move forward on both repair and replace.,25,,
147,0.97,1126.058,1134.466,And we continue to manage low bridge access and the critical connection that that still provides to and from West Seattle.,25,,
148,0.97,1134.466,1147.813,Moving forward with photo enforcement later this year as well as making sure we have the right balance of access needs to make sure that remain as critical freight transit and emergency response corridor.,25,,
149,0.97,1147.813,1151.717,With that I will turn it over to heather and let her take it away.,25,,
150,0.97,1151.717,1167.266,"Really quickly before heather begins her portion of the presentation, colleagues did want to acknowledge that as I mentioned this morning, Calvin chow is on the call with us and Calvin, did you want to make some comments now or did you want to wait until later?",26,,
151,0.97,1167.266,1177.209,I'm here mostly to support the Council members and follow up on any questions you might have and I'll Interject if it makes sense to.,27,,
152,0.97,1177.209,1180.779,Great.,28,,
153,0.97,1180.779,1181.046,Perfect.,28,,
154,0.97,1181.046,1183.448,Calvin is available to us on this particular issue.,28,,
155,0.97,1183.448,1192.991,If you do have questions that you'd like to direct to Calvin as opposed to the Department he is available for those questions.,28,,
156,0.97,1192.991,1223.855,"And then I know we all now know how to use the raise your hand feature in zoom because we've been using it diligently and expertly in our budget committee meetings so if you do have questions throughout the presentation please raise your hand using the raise your hand feature on zoom and I will be monitoring that screen, participant screen and will call on folks in the order that I see hands raised.",28,,
157,0.97,1223.855,1234.366,That'll just make my job a little easier since in the presentation view it's difficult to see everybody's tiles at the same time.,28,,
158,0.97,1234.366,1241.206,So please make sure to use the raise your hand feature on zoom if you have a question.,28,,
159,0.97,1241.206,1247.379,And I am happy to facilitate that Q & amp; a process.,28,,
160,0.97,1247.379,1248.313,"Heather, take it away.",28,,
161,0.97,1248.313,1255.687,Thank you so much Council President Gonzalez and all the Council members for inviting us here to brief.,29,,
162,0.97,1255.687,1268.133,As Sam mentioned I have given this presentation a number of times and so if I skate over something too quickly pleads don't hesitate to ask and I'm happy to elaborate on any of these items.,29,,
163,0.97,1268.133,1279.945,"Just to take us back to March 23rd, that was the day that we closed the bridge to traffic due to rapid growth in cracking along the center section of the bridge.",29,,
164,0.97,1279.945,1293.825,Even after we took that live load off the bridge we noticed that the cracks continued to grow and so that confirmed for us that removing traffic was the right thing to do.,29,,
165,0.97,1293.825,1297.062,The Mayor declared the closure a city emergency in July.,29,,
166,0.97,1297.062,1308.473,And as ever public safety is our top priority as we work to stabilize the bridge and determine a path going forward.,29,,
167,0.97,1308.473,1308.807,Next slide.,29,,
168,0.97,1308.807,1309.107,Thank you.,29,,
169,0.97,1309.107,1317.182,This is a fun 3D kind of image that demonstrates what we are doing to stable size the bridge.,29,,
170,0.97,1317.182,1321.319,When I say stabilize the bridge I mean do things to make sure it doesn't fall down.,29,,
171,0.97,1321.319,1329.194,Just to bring it out of the engineering world and into real people speak.,29,,
172,0.97,1329.194,1343.108,We have added new post tensioning to the center section of the bridge which is what you see here as well as release the restraint on the lateral bearing at Pier 18.,29,,
173,0.97,1343.108,1355.654,The stabilization won't restore traffic but it does improve the safety of the standing bridge and preserves the structure from further impacts from the environment.,29,,
174,0.97,1355.654,1362.427,This is a really good picture that can show the scale of what we're doing inside the bridge.,29,,
175,0.97,1362.427,1376.341,I believe that Shawna sent out a broad invitation for Council members to come and see inside the bridge so you can experience this for yourself.,29,,
176,0.97,1376.341,1381.98,This image shows the inside of one of the box girders underneath the bridge.,29,,
177,0.97,1381.98,1392.758,You can see from the size of the people and the size of the equipment including the brackets that fasten.,29,,
178,0.97,1392.758,1399.664,"The post tensioning tendons, as well as the Deviator blocks that this is really big.",29,,
179,0.97,1399.664,1402.367,These are big things that are happening inside.,29,,
180,0.97,1402.367,1412.144,This stabilization puts us on the right path if we repair the bridge and it's also necessary for safe demolition if we decide to move to replace.,29,,
181,0.97,1412.144,1412.611,Next slide please.,29,,
182,0.97,1412.611,1414.479,Can I just actually.,30,,
183,0.97,1414.479,1418.183,Just to give a little finer point on this.,30,,
184,0.97,1418.183,1425.09,"Each one of those brackets is connected through the deck, through the structure of the bridge down below the bridge.",30,,
185,0.97,1425.09,1428.827,Each one of those weighs over a ton.,30,,
186,0.97,1428.827,1442.707,"Each of those post tensioning strands is about 300 feet long and is being Ratcheted up to 280,000 pounds of tension.",30,,
187,0.97,1442.707,1454.419,"Each one of those dozen strands that are shown there, this is being done in this and then there's a parallel, there's two of these box girders underneath the deck of the bridge.",30,,
188,0.97,1454.419,1458.69,This is being done two times.,30,,
189,0.97,1458.69,1459.458,One in each of those.,30,,
190,0.97,1459.458,1461.693,And that's what's been necessary to stabilize the bridge.,30,,
191,0.97,1461.693,1475.574,"When we get to talking about the repair Pathway, that would be--there would be the same type of thing but more of the same type of thing in it a repair scenario.",30,,
192,0.97,1475.574,1487.853,That's just a sense of scale of what we're talking about when we talk about Stabilization and then as we move into talking about repair.,30,,
193,0.97,1487.853,1488.153,Right.,31,,
194,0.97,1488.153,1488.753,"And just, sorry.",31,,
195,0.97,1488.753,1495.327,Just to also give you a sense of scale.,31,,
196,0.97,1495.327,1498.997,"Each of those strands holds 40,000 pounds.",31,,
197,0.97,1498.997,1503.802,"And so that's 280,000 pounds per tendon, that's the big thick piece.",31,,
198,0.97,1503.802,1518.35,"So we're talking about a huge amount of work that this steel rope, if you will, is performing for us.",31,,
199,0.97,1518.35,1528.193,Just in terms of keeping folks informed we are sending out updates to more than 8000 people every week.,31,,
200,0.97,1528.193,1529.995,Those are folks that have signed up.,31,,
201,0.97,1529.995,1533.498,That's something that you can do on our web page.,31,,
202,0.97,1533.498,1538.036,We've posted 51 Blog postings with the community.,31,,
203,0.97,1538.036,1544.509,"We have twice as many Blog users this year as we did last year, which is pretty significant.",31,,
204,0.97,1544.509,1549.581,We've done a huge amount of interviews in response to media requests.,31,,
205,0.97,1549.581,1556.288,We've met with more than 100 stake holder groups which is why I'm so good at delivering this presentation.,31,,
206,0.97,1556.288,1561.626,And we've created four advisory groups to inform and guide the city's response.,31,,
207,0.97,1561.626,1569.234,You've heard both Council member Pedersen and Council member Herbold mention the community task force.,31,,
208,0.97,1569.234,1579.577,We've employed a technical advisory panel made up of structural engineers and Geotechnical engineers to help us.,31,,
209,0.97,1579.577,1595.226,We brought together a resource group which consists of some of the largest employers in the city as well as Maritime and industrial town hall.,31,,
210,0.97,1595.226,1596.294,Next slide.,31,,
211,0.97,1596.294,1604.536,We created an E-mail box to collect all the responses we've had.,31,,
212,0.97,1604.536,1607.839,This pie chart shows you what kind of topics we're seeing.,31,,
213,0.97,1607.839,1617.182,I always find it interesting to see that low bridge access gets more play than the repair or replace decision.,31,,
214,0.97,1617.182,1635.867,We've launched Reconnect West Seattle to build traffic management based on community input and we have stood up and are working with a low bridge subcommittee to manage access across the lower Spokane Street bridge.,31,,
215,0.97,1635.867,1642.14,Especially with the advent of automated enforcement.,31,,
216,0.97,1642.14,1642.907,Next slide please.,31,,
217,0.97,1642.907,1648.78,So we maintain emergency vehicle access as the top priority for the low bridge.,31,,
218,0.97,1648.78,1652.684,This is the little bridge that could.,31,,
219,0.97,1652.684,1655.42,"It can carry about 20,000 people a day.",31,,
220,0.97,1655.42,1657.222,"20,000 vehicle as day.",31,,
221,0.97,1657.222,1667.832,"As such it is not a good substitute for the high bridge, but it is a good substitute for emergency vehicles as well as freight and transit.",31,,
222,0.97,1667.832,1673.505,"We have opened up access for other users, including everyone between 9:00 P.M.",31,,
223,0.97,1673.505,1674.005,And 5:00 A.M.,31,,
224,0.97,1674.005,1681.012,And it's funny when you look at the volume on the bridge it just spikes right after 9:00 P.M.,31,,
225,0.97,1681.012,1684.482,So I'm sure people are making good use of that.,31,,
226,0.97,1684.482,1689.721,School buses and employer Shuttles will be able to use the low bridge when they operate.,31,,
227,0.97,1689.721,1699.064,We have about 15 Van pools worth of essential workers mostly working at hospitals in the region.,31,,
228,0.97,1699.064,1706.438,We have opened up access for certain Maritime and industrial users including Ilwu.,31,,
229,0.97,1706.438,1715.246,They need access not for commute purposes but in order to get to and from aspects of their job during the day.,31,,
230,0.97,1715.246,1728.359,We've also handed over about 13 Placard for the West Seattle Chamber of Commerce so that small businesses can get to COSTCO or wherever they need to go to Resupply their businesses.,31,,
231,0.97,1728.359,1734.532,You all are probably well aware that automated enforcement cameras will be installed in November.,31,,
232,0.97,1734.532,1742.44,We'll be testing those in December and monetary penalties will begin in early January.,31,,
233,0.97,1742.44,1748.48,You can see from this photograph that we have already installed the Signage that is required there.,31,,
234,0.97,1748.48,1768.233,The access policy will be dynamic with on going monitoring and adjustment as we learn how we can provide more access while maintaining that priority for emergency vehicles.,31,,
235,0.97,1768.233,1768.733,Next slide please.,31,,
236,0.97,1768.733,1780.078,Reconnect West Seattle is a program to allow similar levels of travel across the Duwamish River to those that were seen before the closure of the West Seattle high bridge.,31,,
237,0.97,1780.078,1786.684,And at the same time we want to reduce the impact of environmental injustice in the Duwamish valley.,31,,
238,0.97,1786.684,1791.055,"So we've done a great deal of work, lots of public input since July.",31,,
239,0.97,1791.055,1805.937,"We had a survey where we received 15,000 responses, more than 17--we have 22 projects underway.",31,,
240,0.97,1805.937,1813.945,That's including the other traffic management projects that we've done just as a way to maintain flow.,31,,
241,0.97,1813.945,1819.384,We have about 33 projects being designed right now and planned for delivery in 2021.,31,,
242,0.97,1819.384,1828.359,As you all know the wintertime when it's cold and rainy is not a great time for paving and installing Lane lines.,31,,
243,0.97,1828.359,1852.717,We are also working with our partners on a mobility action plan to increase the availability of transit both rubber tire transit as well as water borne transit and we're going to be delivering most of that in 2021.,31,,
244,0.97,1852.717,1853.151,Next slide please.,31,,
245,0.97,1853.151,1858.957,"We are engaging heavily with the neighborhoods of Georgetown, South park and Highland park.",31,,
246,0.97,1858.957,1863.828,These are the neighborhoods through which almost all of the detoured traffic needs to go.,31,,
247,0.97,1863.828,1869.901,And they have all these neighborhoods have seen a significant increase in traffic.,31,,
248,0.97,1869.901,1873.605,This does a couple of thing.,31,,
249,0.97,1873.605,1885.483,Not only does it create a situation where unfamiliar and frustrated drivers are making choices they maybe wouldn't make in terms of speed and diversion in their own neighborhoods.,31,,
250,0.97,1885.483,1892.223,But it's also increasing the levels of air pollution.,31,,
251,0.97,1892.223,1894.525,We have a partnership with the Department of neighborhoods.,31,,
252,0.97,1894.525,1905.37,"We're so grateful for them to engage and elevate input from black, indigenous and people of color communities particularly in these neighborhoods.",31,,
253,0.97,1905.37,1911.142,Regular updates and engagement via the community liaisons in seven different languages.,31,,
254,0.97,1911.142,1926.658,"We've hosted socially distanced as you can see walking tours, briefings over zoom and meetings to understand neighborhood safety priorities.",31,,
255,0.97,1926.658,1927.625,Next slide please.,31,,
256,0.97,1927.625,1930.495,As Sam mentioned we're moving ahead to restore traffic.,31,,
257,0.97,1930.495,1937.869,I'm speaking to you from a very chilly neighborhood of West Seattle and Sam also lives in West Seattle.,31,,
258,0.97,1937.869,1943.808,This is not just a job it's personal for us.,31,,
259,0.97,1943.808,1960.625,Since the bridge closed we've been advancing both repair and replacement pathways and I'll tell you that all of our engineer friends that we work with would really prefer that we do this in sequence but we're doing it simultaneously.,31,,
260,0.97,1960.625,1963.895,There is not a divergence on the different pathways.,31,,
261,0.97,1963.895,1966.13,We can still go either way and haven't lost any time.,31,,
262,0.97,1966.13,1975.406,All the work to date informs decisions and provides an improved understanding of the risks involved with both options.,31,,
263,0.97,1975.406,1982.18,Risk tolerance is ultimately the biggest consideration for anybody who is evaluating these choices.,31,,
264,0.97,1982.18,1990.455,And there are so many factors and perspectives to consider.,31,,
265,0.97,1990.455,2003.334,"Not just the perspectives of our neighbors here in West Seattle and throughout the Duwamish Valley, but also just the solid engineering that has to go into either of these choices.",31,,
266,0.97,2003.334,2008.072,There's a lot to consider.,31,,
267,0.97,2008.072,2008.506,Next slide please.,31,,
268,0.97,2008.506,2019.083,"As such for you and certainly for the Mayor whose decision ultimately it is, there are so many things that are going into this.",31,,
269,0.97,2019.083,2025.189,The cost benefit analysis is one piece.,31,,
270,0.97,2025.189,2027.025,The technical advisory input is another.,31,,
271,0.97,2027.025,2027.892,The community feedback is critical.,31,,
272,0.97,2027.892,2033.331,"All of us have to consider the external factors in the city, state and nation.",31,,
273,0.97,2033.331,2038.469,Sdot as the owner of the asset has some asset management input to give.,31,,
274,0.97,2038.469,2054.886,We have to be thinking carefully about timing and funding opportunities and then just the uncertainties and risks that follow along with any decision of this magnitude.,31,,
275,0.97,2054.886,2070.935,"So just a real quick Primer on the cost benefit analysis, which I think we have sent to all the Council members if you're feeling like 85 pages is your jam.",31,,
276,0.97,2070.935,2080.711,The cost benefit analysis provides analysis for five different alternatives we started without six but alternative three was removed due to cost and feasibility issues.,31,,
277,0.97,2080.711,2086.551,If you have questions about that we can maybe talk about that a little bit later.,31,,
278,0.97,2086.551,2089.854,"We looked at shoring, full repair, super structure replacement.",31,,
279,0.97,2089.854,2092.623,That's where you take the top part off.,31,,
280,0.97,2092.623,2104.535,Full replacement which is both the top part as well as the piers and then an immersed tube tunnel option which instead of being on alignment needed to be off alignment.,31,,
281,0.97,2104.535,2110.141,The cost benefit analysis is a conservative evaluation reflecting zero percent design.,31,,
282,0.97,2110.141,2114.979,The costs that we're just about to talk about are not estimates.,31,,
283,0.97,2114.979,2117.782,Just order of magnitude conceptual cost data.,31,,
284,0.97,2117.782,2119.183,That's really important.,31,,
285,0.97,2119.183,2121.185,The cost benefit analysis doesn't yield a decision.,31,,
286,0.97,2121.185,2130.194,"It just helps us understand and compare performance, costs and risks.",31,,
287,0.97,2130.194,2130.628,Next slide please.,31,,
288,0.97,2130.628,2136.501,So the Synopsis is probably what you would guess even if you hadn't read it.,31,,
289,0.97,2136.501,2140.071,Repair has a better cost to performance ratio.,31,,
290,0.97,2140.071,2144.041,Has a lot lower up front capital cost.,31,,
291,0.97,2144.041,2146.444,Ultimately though a higher life cycle maintenance cost.,31,,
292,0.97,2146.444,2157.155,"There's a quicker return to traffic but also significant risks associated with that, including another unplanned closure in the future.",31,,
293,0.97,2157.155,2166.364,"The replacement options four, five and six perform better overall but they have significantly higher up front capital costs.",31,,
294,0.97,2166.364,2167.098,Lower life cycle maintenance.,31,,
295,0.97,2167.098,2176.541,And a little bit longer time to return to traffic but the success doesn't depend on the bridge reactions to stabilization.,31,,
296,0.97,2176.541,2184.549,And there's a lower risk that it wouldn't achieve its 75 year service life.,31,,
297,0.97,2184.549,2184.982,Next slide please.,31,,
298,0.97,2184.982,2198.429,One of the ideas that came to us through our request for proposals process as we were looking for somebody to design the new bridge is this what we're calling the rapid replacement option.,31,,
299,0.97,2198.429,2203.067,It was a concept developed by Hntb.,31,,
300,0.97,2203.067,2205.403,This is Sdot's replacement design consultant.,31,,
301,0.97,2205.403,2211.776,I do want to note this isn't a novel concept or something that's never been done.,31,,
302,0.97,2211.776,2213.311,But it is new for us.,31,,
303,0.97,2213.311,2225.489,The steel bridge lightens the load on the existing shortened piers so it improves some performance.,31,,
304,0.97,2225.489,2230.528,There's a bridge that Hntb delivered quickly and inexpensively.,31,,
305,0.97,2230.528,2236.901,I encourage you to examine that if you like.,31,,
306,0.97,2236.901,2243.708,Needs further examination but Streamlines permitting and construction.,31,,
307,0.97,2243.708,2246.41,Here is a nice comparison of all the alternatives.,31,,
308,0.97,2246.41,2253.217,This is all data that is coming out of the cost benefit analysis with the exception of rapid replacement.,31,,
309,0.97,2253.217,2269.934,"That idea came to us at a time when we were already underway with the cost benefit analysis so these are, you'll see that these have ranges instead of specific rough order of magnitude costs.",31,,
310,0.97,2269.934,2274.739,The structure of the CBA required us to have just one number.,31,,
311,0.97,2274.739,2282.246,"These look very, very specific like very specific numbers but they should not be regarded that way forever.",31,,
312,0.97,2282.246,2305.736,"This table shows you the alternatives with their estimated up front construction costs, total ownership costs, the Yearish that they would restore traffic and the life span we could expect out of the repair or replacement.",31,,
313,0.97,2305.736,2307.271,Next slide please.,31,,
314,0.97,2307.271,2318.482,"So the West Seattle bridge CIP, the immediate response and thank you all very much for understanding the Criticality of getting a little bit of money flowing so that we could keep the work going.",31,,
315,0.97,2318.482,2329.093,Our project is still in preliminary design and so the costs presented are rough order of magnitude range estimates.,31,,
316,0.97,2329.093,2335.199,There's about $190 million added in the new CIP to year.,31,,
317,0.97,2335.199,2342.139,100Million in existing bond authority and up to 150 million anticipated with additional sources Tbd.,31,,
318,0.97,2342.139,2351.716,We've secured $8.4 million in Federal grants.,31,,
319,0.97,2351.716,2352.149,Next slide please.,31,,
320,0.97,2352.149,2361.358,So obviously a project such as this whether it is repair or replacement is going to require a funding strategy not just the city council writing a check.,31,,
321,0.97,2361.358,2367.832,We're going to leverage that initial investment and thank you for that.,31,,
322,0.97,2367.832,2373.971,It really does demonstrate the value that the Council and the city put on this bridge.,31,,
323,0.97,2373.971,2382.613,We've spent about $20 million to date on Stabilization and emergency repairs but also on the traffic mitigation efforts.,31,,
324,0.97,2382.613,2383.514,And planning.,31,,
325,0.97,2383.514,2392.089,"Our intention is to partner with Washington state, the port of Seattle, the Puget sound regional and other stake holders.",31,,
326,0.97,2392.089,2396.694,"Everyone recognizes the local, regional and statewide economic and mobility significance of the bridge.",31,,
327,0.97,2396.694,2401.398,That hasn't been difficult to explain.,31,,
328,0.97,2401.398,2407.638,We also anticipate seeking Federal funding both discretionary grants and formula funds.,31,,
329,0.97,2407.638,2428.526,We've worked closely particularly with Senator Murray to support new investment for bridges in the next surface transportation authorization and we intend to use Usdot programs including competitive programs.,31,,
330,0.97,2428.526,2437.067,We're pursuing additional funding for bridges in the fiscal year 2022 appropriations and any potential future infrastructure package.,31,,
331,0.97,2437.067,2444.809,I for one am crossing my fingers.,31,,
332,0.97,2444.809,2445.709,Next slide please.,31,,
333,0.97,2445.709,2446.61,Everybody loves infrastructure; right?,31,,
334,0.97,2446.61,2450.181,That is the end of my presentation.,31,,
335,0.97,2450.181,2451.715,I am happy to answer any questions.,31,,
336,0.97,2451.715,2457.922,Thank you for that presentation.,32,,
337,0.97,2457.922,2458.389,Really appreciate it.,32,,
338,0.97,2458.389,2462.326,"Calvin, anything you want to add for Council members to consider before we open it up for questions?",32,,
339,0.97,2462.326,2472.236,I think the only thing I wanted to highlight is there isn't any legislative action in front of you today.,33,,
340,0.97,2472.236,2476.173,There is obviously a budget impact that you're considering in the 2021 budget.,33,,
341,0.97,2476.173,2480.444,Earlier this summer you did take action to approve $70 million for this project.,33,,
342,0.97,2480.444,2490.521,There's an additional $30 million proposed in the 2021 budget and the executive signaled intent to request an additional $50 million in 2022.,33,,
343,0.97,2490.521,2495.559,No actions in front of you today except for the Budget- related actions.,33,,
344,0.97,2495.559,2495.826,Okay.,34,,
345,0.97,2495.826,2510.274,It's been mentioned a few times that the repair and replacement decision ultimately belongs to Mayor Durkan.,34,,
346,0.97,2510.274,2516.08,"One, I like to get confirmation of that from you, Calvin.",34,,
347,0.97,2516.08,2529.56,"And then two, if you can describe sort of what Council's actions Legislatively would be limited to, you know, once that decision is made, that I think would be helpful context.",34,,
348,0.97,2529.56,2532.196,Sure.,35,,
349,0.97,2532.196,2541.305,So certainly the Mayor gets to direct the Department on how she wants to proceed with projects and pursue replacement or repair.,35,,
350,0.97,2541.305,2549.013,"It is at 0% design right now, so we don't know what we don't know and we could learn more about the costs or risks associated with the project.",35,,
351,0.97,2549.013,2555.185,I tend to think of it more about sort of identifying a preferred alternative for the environmental work that is to come.,35,,
352,0.97,2555.185,2571.869,It could be that we have to change course and so it may be prudent to think about whatever option we don't pick how do we make sure that's not completely lost if we did have to change track.,35,,
353,0.97,2571.869,2585.149,I think the next obvious opportunity would be the budget process going forward to understand what the status of the funding requests are.,35,,
354,0.97,2585.149,2586.317,Certainly if there's grant funding.,35,,
355,0.97,2586.317,2591.021,May be the opportunity for Council to get involved.,35,,
356,0.97,2591.021,2591.889,Council does control the Pursestrings.,35,,
357,0.97,2591.889,2595.526,There is that back check on it.,35,,
358,0.97,2595.526,2601.565,It is certainly the executive's prerogative to decide the first steps on which we we go.,35,,
359,0.97,2601.565,2603.167,Thanks for that.,36,,
360,0.97,2603.167,2610.808,I just thought that would be important information for the general public in terms of who is making decisions where and how.,36,,
361,0.97,2610.808,2622.152,And in asking that question I don't want to imply that we are not working Collaboratively with the executive on this particular issue.,36,,
362,0.97,2622.152,2638.135,"We have been, in fact and really have appreciated the transparency and the sharing of so much information that is going to be relevant to working on this issue collectively and together.",36,,
363,0.97,2638.135,2644.708,So do appreciate making sure that we all understand what our respective official roles are in terms of this project.,36,,
364,0.97,2644.708,2659.089,While also making sure that the general public has an understanding and confidence that there has been really strong collaboration and cooperation between the executive and the city council on this particular capital project.,36,,
365,0.97,2659.089,2662.159,So appreciate that.,36,,
366,0.97,2662.159,2664.595,We have a couple questions in the Queue.,36,,
367,0.97,2664.595,2671.035,Thank you for using the raise your hand feature.,36,,
368,0.97,2671.035,2671.935,Thank you so much.,37,,
369,0.97,2671.935,2674.638,This is a question for Calvin.,37,,
370,0.97,2674.638,2685.349,Thank you so much for sharing with Council members over the weekend the memo from our independent Council consultant Rhc.,37,,
371,0.97,2685.349,2697.461,I'm just wondering is this the appropriate time to ask that you present those sort of preliminary observations from it our Rhc or is there another way we should discuss that?,37,,
372,0.97,2697.461,2697.861,That's fine.,38,,
373,0.97,2697.861,2701.231,I can do that now.,38,,
374,0.97,2701.231,2711.141,Earlier this year Council did hire a structural engineering consultant to bring some expertise to support your consideration in this project.,38,,
375,0.97,2711.141,2719.516,I did send out a memo at the end of last week just documenting their review of the cost benefit analysis.,38,,
376,0.97,2719.516,2725.456,They really had three kind of main points.,38,,
377,0.97,2725.456,2744.808,As structural engineers they feel that you have the original design drawings and you have the structure that can be evaluated and so it is possible to learn more about the repair option and compare it at a different level than this sort of more conceptual replace option.,38,,
378,0.97,2744.808,2751.715,"And that may help better understand the cost, better understand the risks.",38,,
379,0.97,2751.715,2772.002,"I think it's sort of a, I think the executive has been clear that they've been trying to kind of put the options at a level playing field in the CBA and I think our consultant's perspective is but you could learn more if you wanted to to try to identify the costs further.",38,,
380,0.97,2772.002,2790.888,Another issue they raised is related to the life cycle costs and just sort of questioning how that is a like for like comparison and then the last issue that they raised was sort of support to bring the rapid replacement option up to the same sort of level of analysis.,38,,
381,0.97,2790.888,2800.33,They listed some technical structural engineering types of risks that should be evaluated.,38,,
382,0.97,2800.33,2800.664,Go ahead.,39,,
383,0.97,2800.664,2817.881,"I think it would be helpful if you could explain a little bit more about in particular sort of the observations around the way the comparisons were made and whether or not they were sort of, for instance, the life cycle costs.",40,,
384,0.97,2817.881,2833.13,If you could sort of tease that out a little bit more so folks in the viewing audience understand the implications of the consultant's recommendations in that area.,40,,
385,0.97,2833.13,2833.397,Sure.,41,,
386,0.97,2833.397,2838.969,I may get this wrong because I'm drawing it from memory.,41,,
387,0.97,2838.969,2857.421,Some of the issues are when the CBA shows something like 15 to 40 year consideration of use of the structure how are we considering the future phase that sort of the back end of the repair phase and comparing that in an apples to apples way.,41,,
388,0.97,2857.421,2887.251,"I think some of their concerns were also around if you did find out, if you did more engineering on the structure, the existing structure and you were able to reduce know more for certain about the costs and what's involved maybe you do reduce the risks that are factoring into the CBA and in their consideration they were, you know, they would expect the repair options to show a little better than they do.",41,,
389,0.97,2887.251,2910.474,I do think it's driven a lot by the fact that with the existing design and with the structure that is available to be analyzed and models there's more tools to explore that option than we have for some of these conceptual ideas that are still rapidly evolving and are at zero percent design.,41,,
390,0.97,2910.474,2917.914,I want to make sure I'm tracking this conversation because I think it's an important one.,42,,
391,0.97,2917.914,2927.391,"So colleagues for those of you who may have missed Calvin's E- mail, that went out on Friday.",42,,
392,0.97,2927.391,2928.692,And it's time stamped 12:40 P.M.,42,,
393,0.97,2928.692,2933.03,If you're digging through your Inbox currently.,42,,
394,0.97,2933.03,2940.604,It's a two page memorandum from Rhc engineering.,42,,
395,0.97,2940.604,2942.472,Jane Lee and Jimmy Chen.,42,,
396,0.97,2942.472,2953.383,The memo is dated November 6th and does go through an analysis of the cost benefit analysis that we're discussing here.,42,,
397,0.97,2953.383,2995.058,"I think what I'm understanding from this conversation is that the consultants that are at Rhc engineering are flagging that the cost benefit analysis presented to us by Sdot really to alternative 2 which is repair versus a super structure replacement, may not be completely reflective of what the true costs would be in terms of perform as well.",42,,
398,0.97,2995.058,2995.325,Is that?,42,,
399,0.97,2995.325,3000.397,Am I understanding sort of generally?,42,,
400,0.97,3000.397,3022.052,My interpretation of the memo is that they are really highlighting if you'll remember in the presentation today the Sdot kind of highlighted that the CBA is trying to compare options.,43,,
401,0.97,3022.052,3037.701,My take away is that our structural engineering professionals think you could learn a lot more about the repair option and sorts of Ratchet down your knowledge about that that might benefit inform the decision.,43,,
402,0.97,3037.701,3047.577,I think in general they like to work on repair options because it's what they know.,43,,
403,0.97,3047.577,3049.212,It's their professional job.,43,,
404,0.97,3049.212,3057.521,But I think it's part of how the decision has been structured in the CBA at least is to try to stay at a high level.,43,,
405,0.97,3057.521,3067.097,"I think what our consultant is saying is but you have other information available to you, how does that factor in to the decision.",43,,
406,0.97,3067.097,3068.165,Got it.,44,,
407,0.97,3068.165,3069.232,Okay.,44,,
408,0.97,3069.232,3073.236,That's helpful.,44,,
409,0.97,3073.236,3075.238,I appreciate it.,44,,
410,0.97,3075.238,3075.906,Council member Morales.,44,,
411,0.97,3075.906,3076.64,Thank you.,45,,
412,0.97,3076.64,3078.008,Thanks for flagging the memo.,45,,
413,0.97,3078.008,3082.813,I did Miss it so I will make sure I get a chance to look through that.,45,,
414,0.97,3082.813,3091.655,I have a few questions so if it's okay Maybe I'll just ask them all and then we can go from there.,45,,
415,0.97,3091.655,3097.461,The first question is about slide five and the post tension work that you were talking about.,45,,
416,0.97,3097.461,3099.096,I am not a structural engineer.,45,,
417,0.97,3099.096,3100.464,Not any kind of engineer.,45,,
418,0.97,3100.464,3114.444,"I'm wondering if you could offer sort of a layman's explanation of what's in that box and what those, how that is helping hold up the bridge.",45,,
419,0.97,3114.444,3128.191,I'm interested in learning a little bit more about a rapid replacement and maybe that conversation will change after we dive into a little bit more about this memo that we've Rceived recently.,45,,
420,0.97,3128.191,3139.369,"But in that vein I'm also interested, not that I'm advocating for any in particular yet, but just out of curiosity are there any alternatives being considered?",45,,
421,0.97,3139.369,3141.605,I know this is also part of the conversations.,45,,
422,0.97,3141.605,3159.356,"Some of the questions I'm hearing from constituents and particularly because of the next question which is what are the, how will the climate impacts or the carbon emissions it about either of these options, any of these options be assessed.",45,,
423,0.97,3159.356,3199.863,"And then the last question is really when when you were on slide 18 and talking about the costs of whether it's repair or replace and the different funding sources we might have available to this, I'd be interested to know to date how, get information on any contractors we are using for this work and what plans are in the future for making sure that we are also using women and minority owned businesses contracting with them for this very substantial work that needs to happen in the city.",45,,
424,0.97,3199.863,3210.54,Let me jump in and see if I can respond to the previous discussion as well as some of these questions.,46,,
425,0.97,3210.54,3217.414,I'm also not a structural engineer so I'll preface my comments that way as well.,46,,
426,0.97,3217.414,3229.192,"The way the bridge is constructed what you're looking at in slide five, this is the structure of the bridge.",46,,
427,0.97,3229.192,3230.794,It's called a box girder.,46,,
428,0.97,3230.794,3233.263,What the floor of this is is the bottom of the bridge.,46,,
429,0.97,3233.263,3240.87,"The top of what you see is the ceiling or the, what's underneath the roadway structure.",46,,
430,0.97,3240.87,3255.352,"What's underneath the deck of the structure and so this is the hollow area within the bridge that is, that has always been there.",46,,
431,0.97,3255.352,3255.885,That's there.,46,,
432,0.97,3255.885,3267.831,"The, what this is doing is sort of Cinching everything together because what was happening as the cracks started.",46,,
433,0.97,3267.831,3281.277,The pattern of the cracks started to show made it seem like the weight of the bridge was transferred incorrectly for how it was designed and was leading towards the center of the bridge collapsing.,46,,
434,0.97,3281.277,3301.231,"And so putting these post tensioning strands holds it all together, cinches it back together in tension that will transfer the, be the first part of transferring the loads back to where the bridge was originally designed to carry.",46,,
435,0.97,3301.231,3306.569,One of the walls of the girder to show what's going on inside that area.,46,,
436,0.97,3306.569,3322.318,The rest of the repair work that would be needed would be to do the same type of thing but going from one Pier to the next Pier to tie the walls back together to the pier structure.,46,,
437,0.97,3322.318,3347.01,"I think in response, we got the same memo from the Council consultant and I think as we've tried throughout this process to be very transparent and share information with the whole public we've gotten lots of great feedback from an engineering perspective.",46,,
438,0.97,3347.01,3347.911,We have continued to do that.,46,,
439,0.97,3347.911,3352.716,"Just to be clear, the CBA is not a decision making tool.",46,,
440,0.97,3352.716,3353.85,It's not a decision making thing.,46,,
441,0.97,3353.85,3355.418,It doesn't make the decision for us.,46,,
442,0.97,3355.418,3364.994,It is a tool and a part of the inputs into this large decision.,46,,
443,0.97,3364.994,3379.609,The CBA tries to take the same level of information for all of the alternatives and the alternative pathways and give us an apples to apples comparison.,46,,
444,0.97,3379.609,3393.223,"As we do each step of the way repair work the stabilization, the installation of Realtime monitoring equipment that we did early on in the process, what's called Nondestructive evaluation.",46,,
445,0.97,3393.223,3402.632,"Looking within the concrete to understand the strength of the steel that's left in the bridge which has been, we found a lot of strength left in that steel.",46,,
446,0.97,3402.632,3429.259,That has informed our understanding of a repair Pathway and as we do this right now we continue to learn more about the current structure of the bridge based on how it responds and whether it responds as we anticipate it will from a structuring perspective and the monitoring equipment we have there.,46,,
447,0.97,3429.259,3430.059,That continues to evolve.,46,,
448,0.97,3430.059,3432.495,The CBA was a point in time.,46,,
449,0.97,3432.495,3439.235,The CBA doesn't necessarily need to continue to evolve to inform the decision.,46,,
450,0.97,3439.235,3449.279,It gave a good point in time understanding and then we continue to learn more so it is part of the information overall that we get.,46,,
451,0.97,3449.279,3456.219,So we won't know exactly how the stabilization work works until it's done.,46,,
452,0.97,3456.219,3479.976,"And we'll, you know, in the interest of not losing time and sort of making sure wear advancing all options at the same pace we continue to do work both on design of a replacement and on repair that helps give us the best possible information going forward.",46,,
453,0.97,3479.976,3490.053,"The rapid, I guess to answer Council member Morales some of your additional questions, the rapid replacement I think heather talked about this a little bit.",46,,
454,0.97,3490.053,3499.896,It was a new idea that came to us from the design firm we've brought on to lead a replacement.,46,,
455,0.97,3499.896,3508.137,They have experience with a very similar project in connecting New York and Vermont across Lake Champlain.,46,,
456,0.97,3508.137,3509.172,It's a new idea.,46,,
457,0.97,3509.172,3518.114,We don't have any bridges built like this in the city but it is not unheard of.,46,,
458,0.97,3518.114,3531.895,"It's been tested and done this way of doing a rapid replacement with this style of bridge by the team that we've got on board to help us, help lead us through an eventually replacement.",46,,
459,0.97,3531.895,3533.296,In terms of climate impact.,46,,
460,0.97,3533.296,3536.499,We are keenly aware of the climate emergency we are in.,46,,
461,0.97,3536.499,3551.014,The West Seattle bridge was critical to moving thousands and thousands of West Seattleites back and forth across the Duwamish in bus lanes on the bridge.,46,,
462,0.97,3551.014,3559.022,"That, the loss of that transportation capacity has meant those, there's been an air quality shift.",46,,
463,0.97,3559.022,3579.776,Air quality impacts have moved to other communities within the Duwamish valley that are already stressed from an air quality perspective and have just for health impacts in terms of asthma rates and others that the loss of capacity at the West Seattle high bridge has shifted those burdens.,46,,
464,0.97,3579.776,3585.882,To places that are already feeling those burdens.,46,,
465,0.97,3585.882,3586.95,Then in terms of contracting.,46,,
466,0.97,3586.95,3596.826,A lot of what we've done has been done under sort of emergency basis.,46,,
467,0.97,3596.826,3613.576,As we've gotten more regular done regular sort of contracting procedures we can also report and provide detail on what exactly is going to contractors prime and sub contractors.,46,,
468,0.97,3613.576,3635.598,As we move towards the capital work that will be necessary on either repair or replace standpoint depending on the funding streams we end up using I think we can figure out how the benefits both from a contracting and from a hiring perspective can be broadly felt within our community.,46,,
469,0.97,3635.598,3636.766,Thank you so much.,47,,
470,0.97,3636.766,3642.505,Can I level set really quick on one thing?,48,,
471,0.97,3642.505,3648.111,We have just the stabilization contract was done on an emergency basis.,48,,
472,0.97,3648.111,3672.335,"The design contract, the traffic and revenue study contract and the communications contract were done with a competitive process and set up in order to receive Federal funds and so that means that there's a set threshold for contractors.",48,,
473,0.97,3672.335,3676.205,I don't remember what that is off the top of our head.,48,,
474,0.97,3676.205,3687.016,I recognize the irony in what I'm about to say is a Woman- owned business.,48,,
475,0.97,3687.016,3687.25,Thanks.,48,,
476,0.97,3687.25,3687.517,Okay.,49,,
477,0.97,3687.517,3691.754,Thank you so much for those questions and those answers.,49,,
478,0.97,3691.754,3699.128,Are there any other questions or comments?,49,,
479,0.97,3699.128,3699.729,Council member Mosqueda.,49,,
480,0.97,3699.729,3699.962,Please.,49,,
481,0.97,3699.962,3700.53,"Good morning, everyone.",50,,
482,0.97,3700.53,3708.004,Thank you very much for the presentation today.,50,,
483,0.97,3708.004,3719.348,Can you remind us again what the date is that a decision is going to be made here.,50,,
484,0.97,3719.348,3721.684,I don't think we have a set date.,51,,
485,0.97,3721.684,3731.661,We haven't lost any time on either Pathway that we'll start to get to that point fairly soon but we're not at that point yet.,51,,
486,0.97,3731.661,3734.097,"Thank you very much, director.",52,,
487,0.97,3734.097,3734.697,Any general time frame then?,52,,
488,0.97,3734.697,3742.171,Can we anticipate this in the next two weeks?,52,,
489,0.97,3742.171,3742.505,Two months?,52,,
490,0.97,3742.505,3742.772,Two days?,52,,
491,0.97,3742.772,3747.11,I don't think we're two days.,53,,
492,0.97,3747.11,3747.543,"And I don't, we.",53,,
493,0.97,3747.543,3765.628,Don't want to--I think part of what I'm saying about we haven't lost any time is we don't want to put art if official Timelines on the date that a repair and replace decision needs to be made because we're not at the divergent point as I think Calvin very accurately said.,53,,
494,0.97,3765.628,3771.0,There's still work that can be done on moving forward.,53,,
495,0.97,3771.0,3778.241,We don't have enough information on both pathways to perhaps take a definitive hard turn.,53,,
496,0.97,3778.241,3788.551,We will start to lose some time and we need to move forward definitively while making sure that we manage for the unexpected and the risks that are still out there.,53,,
497,0.97,3788.551,3790.72,Thank you very much.,54,,
498,0.97,3790.72,3791.954,So two quick comments then.,54,,
499,0.97,3791.954,3801.33,One is I look forward to continuing to get feedback from those who would be engaged in the strategies for making this a safe and viable transportation option.,54,,
500,0.97,3801.33,3814.01,I know that the members of Martin Luther King County labor Council are supportive of the rebuild options if number four can be done quickly and safely and we think that is a sustainable strategy.,54,,
501,0.97,3814.01,3816.045,I think they're supportive of that.,54,,
502,0.97,3816.045,3820.917,Otherwise a complete rebuild is something I know that people are continuing to emphasize the importance of.,54,,
503,0.97,3820.917,3825.955,So look forward to continuing to get the feedback from those folks on the front line there.,54,,
504,0.97,3825.955,3848.444,"Number two, you know, I was visited at home by some folks who are really interested in making sure that this lower bridge option, the our neighborhood here in West Seattle is able to access the amenities downtown and in the greater city.",54,,
505,0.97,3848.444,3850.279,Walking across the lower bridge to get to downtown.,54,,
506,0.97,3850.279,3863.192,Thank you for the work you've done along the port downtown because having Biked there pretty recently I know that you have put in additional posts that we're going to keep advocating for a true protective bike Lane.,54,,
507,0.97,3863.192,3866.429,It is a more viable option for folks trying to walk and bike.,54,,
508,0.97,3866.429,3879.342,"One of the things the neighbors have suggested is safe lighting, parking lot, like accessibility area so people could drive to the lower bring and then go across with their Stroller or their bike.",54,,
509,0.97,3879.342,3887.116,And those who are runners have mentioned the importance of beings able to access the city by walking or running.,54,,
510,0.97,3887.116,3901.23,Any comments about the ways in which you're trying to make that area maybe more accessible for folks who would want to use it as a safe park and walk or stroll or bike area?,54,,
511,0.97,3901.23,3905.268,Or a park and ride area.,54,,
512,0.97,3905.268,3905.568,Yeah.,55,,
513,0.97,3905.568,3909.939,The work we've done so far.,55,,
514,0.97,3909.939,3918.18,You've noticed some yellow lines and some better definition of the bike Lane are things that we've been able to do quickly.,55,,
515,0.97,3918.18,3927.89,There's a whole additional set of mitigation efforts that will take us into 2021 that are some of those potentially some of those larger items.,55,,
516,0.97,3927.89,3931.227,I don't know heather if you want to talk about any specifics of those.,55,,
517,0.97,3931.227,3937.5,But we generated all of those ideas through large Community- based process.,55,,
518,0.97,3937.5,3944.407,We heard from lots of people and have tried to match those expectations.,55,,
519,0.97,3944.407,3950.112,We can make sure we commit and deliver on.,55,,
520,0.97,3950.112,3951.113,"Oh heather, you're on mute.",56,,
521,0.97,3951.113,3955.184,It's got to happen once a day; right?,57,,
522,0.97,3955.184,3955.818,Monday mornings.,58,,
523,0.97,3955.818,3956.952,"Good morning, everyone.",59,,
524,0.97,3956.952,3963.192,So I don't know if I have anything specific to share with you.,59,,
525,0.97,3963.192,3974.603,"I am interested in hearing a little more, maybe not now maybe at a separate time about some of the ideas you've heard about.",59,,
526,0.97,3974.603,3977.907,We are really Prioritizing walking and Biking especially over that low bridge.,59,,
527,0.97,3977.907,3986.248,That's a really low impact on the rest of the system way to get across.,59,,
528,0.97,3986.248,4004.166,"There is, it's not a great one, I'll confess, but there is a park and ride that's underneath the Expressway.",59,,
529,0.97,4004.166,4007.236,So it doesn't feel so grim.,59,,
530,0.97,4007.236,4008.17,You got it.,60,,
531,0.97,4008.17,4018.447,We'll talk off line and connect with folks too.,61,,
532,0.97,4018.447,4038.0,"One of the questions I raised earlier was just the, the sheer shock when we see a bridge that has only met its half-life and what kind of remedies we have for the original contractor.",61,,
533,0.97,4038.0,4056.318,I think it is 35 years is a very short time frame for a bridge and if it I'm not mistaken that's half the expected life of this bridge so it feels like they fell woefully short of their responsibilities in constructing this bridge for us and looking forward to hearing more about the remedies on that then.,61,,
534,0.97,4056.318,4065.027,I think if it that is of interest to Council members that's something we should have the city attorney weigh in on in executive session.,62,,
535,0.97,4065.027,4074.503,"I did want to put out there for Council members consideration that perhaps Sdot could talk about what they, the Timeline for learning about how the stabilization work is going.",62,,
536,0.97,4074.503,4094.924,That's sort of the next opportunity to get more information about how the bridge is reacting and sort of that next level of knowledge that we might get from the project.,62,,
537,0.97,4094.924,4099.595,Council member Herbold has a question.,63,,
538,0.97,4099.595,4108.037,So let's dig in to the subject area introduced by Calvin then we'll hear from Council member Herbold.,63,,
539,0.97,4108.037,4117.713,E the problem with not sitting next to each other at the table is we can't elbow each other and decide who is going to answer any specific question.,64,,
540,0.97,4117.713,4119.548,Let me take a shot.,64,,
541,0.97,4119.548,4123.486,Heather might have the same or different thoughts which is all good.,64,,
542,0.97,4123.486,4136.098,As we've been going through the process to date we've been evaluating whether our model of bridge performance matches up with what we're seeing in terms of the instrumentation on the bridge.,64,,
543,0.97,4136.098,4142.137,That started as soon as we were lifting those work platforms into place.,64,,
544,0.97,4142.137,4153.282,So far everything we've seen to date matches with what our expectations are of the model.,64,,
545,0.97,4153.282,4169.732,"The two specific things that are most important right now were the release of Pier 18, the stuck bearing on Pier 18 which is on the East side of the bridge structure on the East side of the river.",64,,
546,0.97,4169.732,4176.305,Which most of that work was completed last week to release that bearing.,64,,
547,0.97,4176.305,4185.347,The second major piece is taking those post tensioning strands up to the full tension that they will carry.,64,,
548,0.97,4185.347,4191.153,And that's also largely complete at this point.,64,,
549,0.97,4191.153,4198.761,What we've seen from the bridge has been consistent with the model we had developed.,64,,
550,0.97,4198.761,4202.631,That led to us understanding what the critical situation with the cracking was to begin with.,64,,
551,0.97,4202.631,4208.203,So all of that is very positive information.,64,,
552,0.97,4208.203,4210.739,What we don't have and won't for some time.,64,,
553,0.97,4210.739,4227.856,It's very chilly this morning but we haven't gone through the full thermal cycle of the bridge and especially when we get down below freezing is is is when we can start to see the concrete perform in different ways.,64,,
554,0.97,4227.856,4228.824,So understanding exactly what would happen.,64,,
555,0.97,4228.824,4241.07,"If we're at the point in a repaired bridge when we do restore live load post, not for the stabilization but from the additional repair work we would still be learning more about the bridge.",64,,
556,0.97,4241.07,4249.845,We would have to keep up that monitoring and understanding of how the performs off into the future.,64,,
557,0.97,4249.845,4280.109,"We can't say how the bridge will perform off into the future until we go through, it'll have to be an on going continuous monitoring effort on a repaired bridge in terms of how it's performing and the county of all of this new stuff and the existing bridge in terms of making sure we are still providing a safe connection from a transportation perspective.",64,,
558,0.97,4280.109,4302.631,Can I just add that we are also in an effort to keep everything going on as quickly as possible we're starting with our first type size and location workshop today so that'll start the design process for a replacement bridge and we're also continuing the process to design the repair.,65,,
559,0.97,4302.631,4313.909,"When Sam talks about we're not losing any time, he's talking about the for the bridge either repair or replacement.",65,,
560,0.97,4313.909,4325.988,We won't start losing time until probably may or June where we do start losing time though is actually pretty quickly when it comes to the funding opportunities.,65,,
561,0.97,4325.988,4349.178,"So those, the question of whether we repair or replace isn't urgent until June but for assembling funding for repair or replacement we need to move forward a little more quickly than that.",65,,
562,0.97,4349.178,4349.845,Okay.,66,,
563,0.97,4349.845,4351.513,Thanks for that.,66,,
564,0.97,4351.513,4353.215,Council member Herbold.,66,,
565,0.97,4353.215,4354.516,Thank you.,67,,
566,0.97,4354.516,4357.92,It's possible that heather just answered part of my question.,67,,
567,0.97,4357.92,4366.829,"But I just have a couple comments first before I get to, I have two questions.",67,,
568,0.97,4366.829,4378.674,Just want to step back about the big differences between option 2 and the replacement option.,67,,
569,0.97,4378.674,4383.278,Option 2 is $47 million cost and 2022 restoration of traffic.,67,,
570,0.97,4383.278,4401.23,The repair option there is a new repair option but the repair option that was evaluated in the CBA is a repair option of six years and about $$400 million at 0% design.,67,,
571,0.97,4401.23,4410.272,"So, you know, big picture, big difference in cost and timeliness of restoration of traffic.",67,,
572,0.97,4410.272,4427.923,The executive rightfully is focused on issue of certainty and their responsibility to to be an asset manager of all of the city's transportation infrastructure.,67,,
573,0.97,4427.923,4442.638,But the technical advisory panel has high confidence that a repair will last for 40 years and the Council's independent consultant is in concurrence with that confidence.,67,,
574,0.97,4442.638,4464.059,"And just highlighting a section from the CBA, the, it States based on the work done to date in the correlation of Analytical monitoring measured behavior, thus limiting the service life likely has a low probability less than 5% of occurring.",67,,
575,0.97,4464.059,4484.179,"They go on to say that the repair alternative 2 has the highest value index, the value index is the ratio of performance to cost and also has at highest potential for an increase in the value index as compared to the other alternatives.",67,,
576,0.97,4484.179,4490.619,As we know equity is also a highly rated attribute in the cost benefit analysis.,67,,
577,0.97,4490.619,4504.299,"And, you know, what equity means to me is we are making an intentional effort to minimize disparate impacts to particular communities.",67,,
578,0.97,4504.299,4520.449,There's a great map included in the cost benefit analysis that illustrates the location of disparate impacts along the Southern portion of the peninsula and the Duwamish communities as well as the percentage of people of color by census track.,67,,
579,0.97,4520.449,4534.496,So for me making a decision with equity really as a big focus of the decision means we are intentionally minimizing the negative impacts in those particular areas.,67,,
580,0.97,4534.496,4548.744,"And a lot has been said about the impacts to business and work force, that's really important for West Seattle specifically small businesses.",67,,
581,0.97,4548.744,4552.547,But also for the regional economy.,67,,
582,0.97,4552.547,4569.064,"So that gets to, I really appreciate director Zimbabwe's recurring statement that we are, the decision before us is more like a preferred alternative.",67,,
583,0.97,4569.064,4569.665,Calvin has reinforced that.,67,,
584,0.97,4569.665,4581.209,"It doesn't mean if there's a preference for one option it doesn't mean that we can't, if we find more information switch to another option.",67,,
585,0.97,4581.209,4589.117,And slide 11 States 245 we're not at the divergence of different pathways.,67,,
586,0.97,4589.117,4591.52,That's something that would be helpful for me to understand.,67,,
587,0.97,4591.52,4608.67,What that says to me is if it there is a decision to pursue for instance replacement we can continue to still work at evaluating repair and taking steps towards repair.,67,,
588,0.97,4608.67,4617.913,So the question I would have is when do those pathways Diverge and maybe that is what heather was referring to when she Referenced May and June.,67,,
589,0.97,4617.913,4628.49,Then my second question is I've heard a lot of concern that the consideration of a rapid replacement could result in delay of a repair Pathway.,67,,
590,0.97,4628.49,4631.393,I'm just interested to hear a little bit about that as well.,67,,
591,0.97,4631.393,4631.693,Sure.,68,,
592,0.97,4631.693,4636.064,Let me take a shot at those.,68,,
593,0.97,4636.064,4651.38,"Because I think like heather said we don't really hit a divergence until next spring but I do, technical on a construction Timeline perspective.",68,,
594,0.97,4651.38,4673.502,"I do think that the, that a rapid replacement idea depends on clearing some of the Nontechnical but more procedural hurdles we'd have to go through on an expedited basis.",68,,
595,0.97,4673.502,4691.953,"On a Timeline that would require very close coordination at all levels of benefit, including up to the U.S. Coast Guard which is the permitting agency for major permitting agency for our bridge.",68,,
596,0.97,4691.953,4704.299,"So I think those Timelines start to get more important from a, than the technical Timelines on, from a construction perspective.",68,,
597,0.97,4704.299,4709.438,And that's when we would see like in the spring really starting to lose time.,68,,
598,0.97,4709.438,4720.115,But have a lot more information going into that time period than we have right now on either repair or replacement path.,68,,
599,0.97,4720.115,4729.658,I would also say that the $47 million in the cost benefit analysis is also at zero percent design of what a repair looks like.,68,,
600,0.97,4729.658,4740.569,We still don't know exactly what will be required to implement a full repair that restores traffic.,68,,
601,0.97,4740.569,4749.211,There is still uncertainty Etch though it's more clear.,68,,
602,0.97,4749.211,4762.324,"Then the cost benefit analysis, from an asset owner perspective is also how the on going operations and maintenance costs will factor into that and what that means for the full life cycle of the bridge.",68,,
603,0.97,4762.324,4781.209,"As I said, there's a lot more we are adding into the bridge right now and would have to add still more as part of a repair that has to be sort of factored into the understanding of what the on going responsibilities are that make it a continuously useful transportation asset.",68,,
604,0.97,4781.209,4796.591,"Exactly what we'll have to do to take care of the bridge and to get into that box just so that we're all on the same page about this, right now to get into the box girder and do the work we've done, we've had to take out part of the deck.",68,,
605,0.97,4796.591,4803.965,We've had to remove part of the deck to get the equipment and people down into the bring.,68,,
606,0.97,4803.965,4806.935,"Usually there's just a Manhole, that's in a traffic Lane on the bridge.",68,,
607,0.97,4806.935,4816.778,To do the work to get down into the bridge and make sure everything is operating we'll still have an on going impact on traffic.,68,,
608,0.97,4816.778,4827.055,"We won't have to open the deck up every time we go down into the bridge, but it's going to take some on going work that will be necessary to maintain the bridge going forward as well.",68,,
609,0.97,4827.055,4837.999,"So it is, there's a lot of factors.",68,,
610,0.97,4837.999,4842.17,Where heather.,68,,
611,0.97,4842.17,4852.781,Before we make determinations that really take us on that divergent directions.,68,,
612,0.97,4852.781,4854.216,"Okay, colleagues.",69,,
613,0.97,4854.216,4861.089,"We are about 10 minutes over, close to 15 minutes over on our time a Lotted for this presentation.",69,,
614,0.97,4861.089,4868.496,I don't want to cut off conversation so if there are any other questions happy to provide an opportunity for folks to pose those questions.,69,,
615,0.97,4868.496,4878.907,Of course this won't be the last opportunity that we have to connect with folks over at Sdot.,69,,

690,0.97,5380.308,5387.148,And one that will be good for partnership not just with Seattle but other American cities.,79,,

693,0.97,5403.765,5409.303,And a sense of urgency to deal with our public health emergency Covid-19.,79,,

702,0.97,5452.28,5455.183,Thank you.,81,,
703,0.97,5455.183,5464.058,I too want to echo the celebration and congratulations to our new president and vice President-elect.,81,,
704,0.97,5464.058,5466.794,Take a quick moment to acknowledge the black women in our community.,81,,
705,0.97,5466.794,5491.485,"We all know there is a lot of work to do still to address the racial equity, the challenges that we have in our community and in our country but as Tasha Mariannes stated on social media over the weekend, black women deserve to celebrate the joy in this moment.",81,,
706,0.97,5491.485,5506.501,We will get to work for everybody soon but I want to acknowledge that and give black women in our community a moment to breathe and celebrate and enjoy this moment.,81,,
707,0.97,5506.501,5512.373,Thank you to everyone for that.,81,,
708,0.97,5512.373,5521.182,Last week I attended a walk hosted by Seattle Greenways.,81,,
709,0.97,5521.182,5536.497,I want to thank my constituents for organizing the event and do want to thank directors for coming out.,81,,
710,0.97,5536.497,5541.836,We discussed some improvements that need to be made at the intersection of Rainier and Henderson.,81,,
711,0.97,5541.836,5543.771,There have been some improvements made there.,81,,
712,0.97,5543.771,5554.248,We do have 300 new units of housing planned in the surrounding area within several blocks and there are four schools also along Henderson.,81,,
713,0.97,5554.248,5564.625,We need to make sure we are planning for future pedestrian safety improvements there.,81,,
714,0.97,5564.625,5569.13,Also joined reach and Lehigh workers at an encampment in the new Holly neighborhood.,81,,
715,0.97,5569.13,5573.868,I want to thank them for their work.,81,,
716,0.97,5573.868,5578.806,We were able to find nine tiny homes for our Unhouse the neighbors who had been living in the park.,81,,
717,0.97,5578.806,5586.147,There are still a few folks there and workers are trying to find more stable living situations for them.,81,,
718,0.97,5586.147,5595.723,I will say one of the gentlemen I spoke to was an elderly man who had just been released from the hospital after suffering from pneumonia.,81,,
719,0.97,5595.723,5605.533,He had been on a waiting list for housing and he thought he had had housing and turned out he was just placed on a waiting list.,81,,
720,0.97,5605.533,5612.34,He was returning to the park because he didn't have anywhere else to go.,81,,
721,0.97,5612.34,5627.188,"So especially now as we're moving into the wet and cold season it's really clear how dire the need is for safe, warm, shelter in our city.",81,,
722,0.97,5627.188,5634.862,My hope is that our outreach workers will be able to find a place for him very soon.,81,,
723,0.97,5634.862,5639.066,We held our first front yard forum this weekend.,81,,
724,0.97,5639.066,5643.971,Which as I've said are physically distant block meetings.,81,,
725,0.97,5643.971,5661.389,"We met with neighbors who wanted to discuss public safety and alternatives to policing and really these are ways you're also interested in understanding better how our constituents can interface with city hall around things like permitting, sidewalk repair.",81,,
726,0.97,5661.389,5673.167,I was very pleased to hear the neighbors on this particular block all know one another very well and work together which there is a opportunity issue.,81,,
727,0.97,5673.167,5678.839,As part of the benefit of having hyper local advocates and community.,81,,
728,0.97,5678.839,5681.542,We will continue having front yard forums.,81,,
729,0.97,5681.542,5683.044,We have one this Thursday.,81,,
730,0.97,5683.044,5690.918,If you're interested in holding one you can reach out to my district.,81,,
731,0.97,5690.918,5702.129,We're also continuing our community office hours virtual hours on Sunday afternoons you can request an appointment for that through our Council Website.,81,,
732,0.97,5702.129,5707.868,One of the issues that comes up no matter who I'm talking to is community safety.,81,,
733,0.97,5707.868,5721.015,Everybody wants their neighborhood to be safe and folks are also acknowledging as they did at the front yard forum that the best way to keep our neighborhoods safe and to keep our neighbors safe is to invest in our neighborhoods.,81,,
734,0.97,5721.015,5726.554,We don't increase that safety necessarily by investing in police.,81,,
735,0.97,5726.554,5729.557,Particularly not at twice the rate of community investments.,81,,
736,0.97,5729.557,5738.766,I want to say this is especially true when we see a Remeeted disregard for our safety of our neighbors exercising their constitutional rights.,81,,
737,0.97,5738.766,5754.815,We have been talking now for six months across the country and our neighbors here in Seattle and in the streets demonstrating their deep frustration about racial inequality in our society.,81,,
738,0.97,5754.815,5758.085,More specifically how that Manifests in police brutality.,81,,
739,0.97,5758.085,5766.494,This Council has been talking for six months about addressing these issues by divesting from the police and investing in communities of color.,81,,
740,0.97,5766.494,5788.749,"And I will say that when we see repeated escalation of police force against people who are demonstrating their rights of free speech, rights to assemble, despite recommendations from every accountability partner they stand down that they reduce contact with public, particularly during these demonstrations.",81,,
741,0.97,5788.749,5791.619,For me it begs several questions.,81,,
742,0.97,5791.619,5798.626,Why are the interim chief and the Mayor disregarding these recommendations?,81,,
743,0.97,5798.626,5802.029,Why are protesters still being met with police in riot gear?,81,,
744,0.97,5802.029,5811.405,Why has a new unit been created whose sole purpose seems to be to clash with those who are exercising their right to protest police accountability.,81,,
745,0.97,5811.405,5815.943,We haven't seen any sign of attempts to Deescalate in any of these situations.,81,,
746,0.97,5815.943,5826.587,"I want to know who is ordering this behavior that includes smashing the car windows of our neighbors, interfering with the press and has even led to people being hospitalized.",81,,
747,0.97,5826.587,5838.199,Why should we continue to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in an agency that has so little regard for the safety and the protected free speech rights of our neighbors.,81,,
748,0.97,5838.199,5847.374,As a council member and a community remember I can't Condone this behavior and I'm tired frankly of asking these questions and getting no response.,81,,
749,0.97,5847.374,5852.112,Every time I ask these questions I get hedging and hand Wringing.,81,,
750,0.97,5852.112,5866.26,So as we enter the final stages of the budget process we'll be discussing how to Reallocate resources in a way that Aligns with our stated goals of restructuring SPD.,81,,
751,0.97,5866.26,5869.697,That means reducing the size of the force.,81,,
752,0.97,5869.697,5870.297,Reducing overtime.,81,,
753,0.97,5870.297,5874.435,Reducing our reliance on a Police-Centered approach to community safety.,81,,
754,0.97,5874.435,5885.212,My office supports these Bud% et actions and is exploring additional ones and I have to be honest and transparent with my constituents.,81,,
755,0.97,5885.212,5891.352,We will not reach our shared goal of 50% reduction in it one budget cycle.,81,,
756,0.97,5891.352,5897.258,Especially when we're budgeting for just a single year right now.,81,,
757,0.97,5897.258,5903.264,So I will also say I am committed to bringing our partners along on the Pathway of reaching that shared goal.,81,,
758,0.97,5903.264,5909.837,Part of that is recognizing that there are road blocks that are in our way.,81,,
759,0.97,5909.837,5915.276,I'm committed to working on these structural impediments so we can reach our goal.,81,,
760,0.97,5915.276,5921.181,Whether that is the contract or state legislation that needs to change to help achieve the goals we have.,81,,
761,0.97,5921.181,5924.385,We know this system is broken.,81,,
762,0.97,5924.385,5928.222,To fix it will take more than just city council's actions.,81,,
763,0.97,5928.222,5932.993,Tomorrow will be the next step in the Council action that we can take.,81,,
764,0.97,5932.993,5935.496,It won't be the last.,81,,
765,0.97,5935.496,5950.01,I look forward to continuing to strive for community safety that protects all of our neighbors to work with this Council to do that.,81,,
766,0.97,5950.01,5953.48,"Thank you, council member Morales for those comments.",82,,
767,0.97,5953.48,5960.02,Any comments or questions on that report?,82,,
768,0.97,5960.02,5960.254,Okay.,82,,
769,0.97,5960.254,5969.33,Hearing none we're going to go ahead and hear now from Council member Mosqueda and then after Council member Mosqueda is Council member Pedersen.,82,,
770,0.97,5969.33,5970.03,"Thank you, very much.",83,,
771,0.97,5970.03,5972.8,I held my comments because I knew I was next.,83,,
772,0.97,5972.8,5978.172,I want to say thank you to Council member Morales for the comments you just made.,83,,
773,0.97,5978.172,5985.045,You have stated all of the things I was going to say.,83,,
774,0.97,5985.045,5986.246,I echo your frustration.,83,,
775,0.97,5986.246,5989.917,I echo your concern and condemnation of on going use of force in the street.,83,,
776,0.97,5989.917,5999.793,You know we have mounting numbers of lawsuits against the city of Seattle and we also have an individual who has been hospitalized.,83,,
777,0.97,5999.793,6018.245,Really appreciate you raising those issues so we can continue to do the important work that we need to do to scale up community investments and create alternatives both to general policing but also reigning in what we have seen in terms of response to mostly first amendment activities.,83,,
778,0.97,6018.245,6025.753,That is I think very well stated by you so I appreciate you saying that.,83,,
779,0.97,6025.753,6040.701,In addition to the celebrations we saw over the new Federal administration in addition to the on going racial reckoning we see in our country across every city we also are seeing increased numbers of Covid cases.,83,,
780,0.97,6040.701,6047.708,"So I just wanted to spend a quick second in reminding folks to please, please keep your masks on.",83,,
781,0.97,6047.708,6052.279,Please practice good public health practices to prevent the spread of Covid.,83,,
782,0.97,6052.279,6065.225,We are reminded about the importance of the on going pandemic and our responsibility to act to prevent the spread when we see the Spiking Covid cases across the country.,83,,
783,0.97,6065.225,6078.705,"The daily average according to a new times report over the weekend is that we are reaching 106,972 daily cases.",83,,
784,0.97,6078.705,6080.007,"Over 106,000 daily cases on average.",83,,
785,0.97,6080.007,6088.549,"According to the New York Times reporter who is locally based here, that means 1 out of every 438 people in the U.S. have tested positive.",83,,
786,0.97,6088.549,6099.326,I know that I saw posts from my friends who are local here in the Seattle region who have been exposed to Covid and are Quarantining now.,83,,
787,0.97,6099.326,6100.627,We all know more than 438 people.,83,,
788,0.97,6100.627,6105.232,One person who has been t least affected by Covid.,83,,
789,0.97,6105.232,6113.807,So please continue to remain vigilant.,83,,
790,0.97,6113.807,6127.821,The charts we are seeing are quite literally off the page when we see the direction we're headed and we altogether must work to bring that number back down.,83,,
791,0.97,6127.821,6138.966,As far as the Finance and housing committee there are no items on today's full council agenda.,83,,
792,0.97,6138.966,6143.07,I would love to add to the introduction and referral calendar this afternoon.,83,,
793,0.97,6143.07,6153.847,Want to give you a quick preview of that and with the approval for the motions needed this afternoon's Council agenda I will be seeking to move an amendment to the introduction and referral calendar.,83,,
794,0.97,6153.847,6163.924,As you know the 2021 proposed budget would authorize a $25 million Interfund loan to support Sdot's on going transportation funding needs.,83,,
795,0.97,6163.924,6168.962,The original bill would have used two sources for the loan.,83,,
796,0.97,6168.962,6177.738,That includes about $20 million from the Iet Fund and the other $5 million coming from the transportation benefit district.,83,,
797,0.97,6177.738,6209.169,Council member Pedersen thank you very much as chair of the transportation committee and I have discussed our concerns about using the original legislation because it might impede on the STBD funds and the cash flow and the ability to support critical infrastructure even though there is a question mark there just to take that question mark hopefully we are introducing in this legislation for this afternoon that would be on the introduction and referral calendar that would go along with the budget activities to replace that strategy.,83,,
798,0.97,6209.169,6219.546,The replacement bill would change the source of the Interfund loan such as the entire 25 million Interfund loan would be from the it Fund.,83,,
799,0.97,6219.546,6225.185,There would no longer be reliance on an Interfund loan.,83,,
800,0.97,6225.185,6229.189,The city budget's office has confirmed that the I.T.,83,,
801,0.97,6229.189,6238.899,Fund has sufficient resources in its coffers for the next few years to serve as the single source of funding for the entire $25 million loan for critical Sdot improvements.,83,,
802,0.97,6238.899,6240.701,So that is what you will see from me.,83,,
803,0.97,6240.701,6248.809,I just want to make sure folks know what the background is there and it does require an amendment to the introduction and referral calendar.,83,,
804,0.97,6248.809,6260.621,"As far as the budget folks have mentioned we are going to release our Council's draft budget tomorrow as 10:00 a.m., 9:30 A.M.",83,,
805,0.97,6260.621,6262.689,Begins our public comment period.,83,,
806,0.97,6262.689,6271.765,We will have the opportunity to walk through the propose Council's budget balancing Backage.,83,,
807,0.97,6271.765,6276.47,Every one of you provided amendments we were able to accommodate to a certain degree.,83,,
808,0.97,6276.47,6285.145,Truly all of the amendments we are discussing for tomorrow's proposed budget have come from the robust public discussion we had.,83,,
809,0.97,6285.145,6310.304,"All of you have provided amendments and suggestions to invest in key priorities in the city, including affordable housing and homelessness, making sure we're creating a strong and equitable economy for all, investing in housing and the green new deal investments and we are doing all of this while getting back to basics by supporting core government services and protecting against budgetary layoffs.",83,,
810,0.97,6310.304,6311.672,I want to thank all of you.,83,,
811,0.97,6311.672,6320.047,I continue to call this the draft Council budget because I hope it reflects various priorities from every single Council member and there's obviously work to be done.,83,,
812,0.97,6320.047,6330.691,As a reminder if you see any additional changes you would like to see those forms those are due on Thursday.,83,,
813,0.97,6330.691,6335.595,We are asking for form C's to be submitted by 10:00 A.M.,83,,
814,0.97,6335.595,6336.897,"On Thursday, no 12th.",83,,
815,0.97,6336.897,6348.575,This would propose any changes you'd like to see for appropriations and policy investments as a reminder these forms are the ones that need to be Self-Balancing.,83,,
816,0.97,6348.575,6368.695,"These could be Self-Balancing either toward reductions and appropriations by shifting appropriations or additional revenue and please note that if proposed revenue increases or require any legislation that that legislation will also need to be introduced and referred to the budget committee by Monday, November 16th.",83,,
817,0.97,6368.695,6394.121,The committee vote on the proposed Council's draft% package and amendments will occur on November 18th and 19th and if any member wishes to move any Council budget action or statement of legislative intent that's not on the published agenda the Agendas must be amended by a majority of the Council members present in order for them to submit the late budget form.,83,,
818,0.97,6394.121,6406.533,This is similar to the process you all used for form B's and for engaging in that process so it's really transparent to all Council offices and the broader public.,83,,
819,0.97,6406.533,6420.881,Thank you in advance for all of your work that we will be doing over the next two weeks and all of the work you've done over the last eight weeks on this budget and a special Shoutout to my office and chief of staff for leading on these efforts.,83,,
820,0.97,6420.881,6425.185,Also the central staff who have been incredible and working around the clock.,83,,
821,0.97,6425.185,6427.888,We want to honor their work.,83,,
822,0.97,6427.888,6439.399,Appreciate how they have helped to bring various budget priorities together to provide a well rounded draft budget for consideration.,83,,
823,0.97,6439.399,6439.699,Thank you.,83,,
824,0.97,6439.699,6442.002,Thank you Council member Mosqueda for that report.,84,,
825,0.97,6442.002,6447.808,Any comments or questions on that report?,84,,
826,0.97,6447.808,6448.341,Council member Morales.,84,,
827,0.97,6448.341,6456.249,Just want to clarify you said that form C's are due at 10:00 Thursday morning?,85,,
828,0.97,6456.249,6456.449,Okay.,85,,
829,0.97,6456.449,6460.353,I have 5:00 Thursday on my calendar so thank you for that clarification.,85,,
830,0.97,6460.353,6470.53,Ditto on my calendar I think there was a calendar invitation that went out to all Council members that sets the deadline at 5:00 P.M.,86,,
831,0.97,6470.53,6481.641,So we may want to ask Patty if they can update that reminder to accurately reflect the Timeline.,86,,
832,0.97,6481.641,6482.475,I will do that.,87,,
833,0.97,6482.475,6483.41,It also says 5:00 P.M.,87,,
834,0.97,6483.41,6485.045,On my calendar in front of me.,87,,
835,0.97,6485.045,6487.347,We may have tried to slip that in.,87,,
836,0.97,6487.347,6489.316,Thank you for catching that Council member Morales.,87,,
837,0.97,6489.316,6493.22,We will follow up with you and if indeed the time is 10:00 A.M.,87,,
838,0.97,6493.22,6495.889,We'll make sure that is reflected.,87,,
839,0.97,6495.889,6499.593,Appreciate your flexibility there and also recognize that's coming the day after a holiday.,87,,
840,0.97,6499.593,6508.835,So we'll follow up with you in writing to make sure everybody has that and that will be included in our Monday Council memo that will be sent out shortly.,87,,
841,0.97,6508.835,6513.573,We'll get you clarification for sure.,87,,
842,0.97,6513.573,6514.875,Thank you for flagging that.,87,,
843,0.97,6514.875,6517.677,The amendment you're making into the introduction referral calendar today.,88,,
844,0.97,6517.677,6539.799,"Just want to make sure that I'm clear that it's, there'll be an amendment to the introduction referral calendar for this Council bill that you just discussed this morning and the intent will be to refer it to the select budget committee?",88,,
845,0.97,6539.799,6540.2,"Yes, please.",89,,
846,0.97,6540.2,6540.467,Great.,90,,
847,0.97,6540.467,6540.767,Thank you.,90,,
848,0.97,6540.767,6552.479,"And then just really quickly wanted to before we go on, council member Mosqueda, I appreciated the comments you made around Covid and the on going spread of that infection.",90,,
849,0.97,6552.479,6568.762,Our numbers are worse now than they were in August certainly and I think I saw a number somewhere that said we're about 50% above where we were at the peak of the infection.,90,,
850,0.97,6568.762,6596.323,"As folks continue to go out into community I think it's really important to remind folks that a mask doesn't make you invincible to infection and that while wearing a mask is really important, equally important if not more important to that is social distancing and that is hard to do when you're out in the streets celebrating with thousands of other people in our streets.",90,,
851,0.97,6596.323,6610.537,I just want to remind folks that wearing a mask is really important but I don't want folks to walk away with the impression that that is going to protect you 100% of the time.,90,,
852,0.97,6610.537,6636.229,Obviously the social distancing with the masks are what is really going to make a difference here and bring our numbers down so just wanted to remind folks of those two strategies that are critical for continuing to contain and get the Covid-19 infection back under control.,90,,
853,0.97,6636.229,6637.931,"Thank you, Council President.",91,,
854,0.97,6637.931,6641.001,"Yes, I think I only emphasized the mask wearing.",91,,
855,0.97,6641.001,6643.603,Absolutely thank you for bringing up the social distancing.,91,,
856,0.97,6643.603,6654.948,Want to underscore that point as public health leaders have been saying so many families and friend gatherings have now moved from outside to indoors because of bad weather.,91,,
857,0.97,6654.948,6659.019,It is part of the reason we're seeing it increase in cases.,91,,
858,0.97,6659.019,6661.221,So do not do that.,91,,
859,0.97,6661.221,6664.157,It's not a good idea.,91,,
860,0.97,6664.157,6673.233,And it is not going to prevent you to sit across the room from each other when Covid remains alive in the air.,91,,
861,0.97,6673.233,6676.87,An air borne disease must require both a mask and true social distancing.,91,,
862,0.97,6676.87,6688.448,"Thank you, Council president and let's not forget, higher numbers of black and Brown folks are not only contracting this disease but are dying from it from a racial equity perspective let's do our part.",91,,
863,0.97,6688.448,6688.948,Absolutely.,92,,
864,0.97,6688.948,6708.268,We have been seeing that the modeling is telling us the occasions and instances is during family gatherings where people are not wearing masks and not physically distancing so we are coming up on holidays.,92,,
865,0.97,6708.268,6710.07,This is a hard time for all of us.,92,,
866,0.97,6710.07,6729.889,It's hard to be away from our friends and our family but really important for us to get back to business as it relates to compliance with these public health recommendations so we can save the lives of our relatives and neighbors and other community members.,92,,
867,0.97,6729.889,6737.797,Appreciate you bringing up that really important subject during this period of time.,92,,
868,0.97,6737.797,6742.001,A thousand people a day are dying because of this.,92,,
869,0.97,6742.001,6744.17,Thank you so much for having that conversation with us.,92,,
870,0.97,6744.17,6755.815,I'm sure all of us are going to be pushing out more information about the public health response on going response to Covid-19 and how to continue to protect ourselves.,92,,
871,0.97,6755.815,6765.992,Right now we're going to go ahead and hand it over to Council member Pedersen and then Council member Sawant.,92,,
872,0.97,6765.992,6771.331,Leadership on the budget process.,92,,
873,0.97,6771.331,6771.865,Really appreciate it.,92,,
874,0.97,6771.865,6777.237,The transportation and utilities committee has no items on today's agenda.,92,,
875,0.97,6777.237,6783.777,"Our transportation and utilities me will resume meetings on Wednesday, December 2ND directly after the fall budget season.",92,,
876,0.97,6783.777,6792.552,In district 4 I want to thank constituents who signed up for my virtual office hours and who talked with me this past Friday afternoon.,92,,
877,0.97,6792.552,6800.326,Key topics this week were public safety and trash accumulation which has become a major problem.,92,,
878,0.97,6800.326,6806.065,Please sign up through my Website for office hours and we'll talk by phone or zoom.,92,,
879,0.97,6806.065,6815.642,I know many of us are breathing a sigh of relief that Donald Trump lost the Presidential election and we have high hopes for the new administration of Biden and Harris.,92,,
880,0.97,6815.642,6826.286,While this positive change may reduce the political temperature I know it must not reduce our resolve to revamp public safety and increase police accountability at all levels of government.,92,,
881,0.97,6826.286,6850.777,At the national level we must once again have a Justice Department that supports Federal oversight of local police departments as we had under the Obama administration with the Federal consent decree at the state government level we must encourage our leaders to enact a higher standard for police reform so we no longer need to negotiate justice with each new police Union contract.,92,,
882,0.97,6850.777,6869.229,At the local level I'm confident we are Recommitting ourselves to revamping the police Union contract here to root out institutional racism to support the good work of first responders and to reinvest resources in a way that truly increases the health and safety of all communities.,92,,
883,0.97,6869.229,6875.902,"While we will disagree and debate how to get there, I remain Confidentthat together we will get there.",92,,
884,0.97,6875.902,6883.042,I know we're also excited about the election results for the Seattle transportation benefit district.,92,,
885,0.97,6883.042,6884.744,The measure was well Crafted.,92,,
886,0.97,6884.744,6885.812,It was a group effort.,92,,
887,0.97,6885.812,6888.948,Won over 80% of the vote in Seattle.,92,,
888,0.97,6888.948,6901.327,And while bus Ridership is at historic lows today our bus system remains vital for essential workers during the pandemic and we have increased transit needs while the high bridge is close.,92,,
889,0.97,6901.327,6908.434,The measure approved by over 80% of voters authorize up to $9 million for capital improvements in 2021.,92,,
890,0.97,6908.434,6916.843,To support infrastructure maintenance and capital improvements that maximize efficiency and reliability.,92,,
891,0.97,6916.843,6925.885,So looking forward to implementing that with Sdot and with my colleagues here.,92,,
892,0.97,6925.885,6926.185,Thank you.,92,,
893,0.97,6926.185,6927.153,Thank you so much.,93,,
894,0.97,6927.153,6932.992,Any questions or comments on that report?,93,,
895,0.97,6932.992,6940.867,Hearing none we'll go ahead and hear from Council member Sawant and then Council member Strauss.,93,,
896,0.97,6940.867,6941.901,Good morning.,94,,
897,0.97,6941.901,6943.036,Thank you President Gonzalez.,94,,
898,0.97,6943.036,6946.539,"Good morning, everybody.",94,,
899,0.97,6946.539,6951.711,There are no items for the Sustainability and Renters rights.,94,,
900,0.97,6951.711,6983.443,"I want to thank the progressive organizations and the peoples budget movement and those supporting the solidarity budget for really pushing on concrete gains for Renters lights, tiny House villages the green new deal and the affordable housing which have been strongly supported by our Socialist Council office and the foreign B's we brought forward been we will continue to advocate for an increase in the Amazon tax to stop the draconian over $200 million of cuts to housing services that exist in the Mayor's proposal.",94,,
901,0.97,6983.443,6990.55,Millions of working people around the country celebrated the defeat of Donald Trump in this unprecedented election.,94,,
902,0.97,6990.55,7001.227,In fact working people and young people from around the world who are watching anxiously these last few days hoping for Donald Trump's Depete are heaving a collective sigh of relief.,94,,
903,0.97,7001.227,7015.608,"As a Socialist and Union member and working class elective representative I join in the celebration of the down fall of this deeply Antiworker, racist, Sectionist, Antiimmigrant President.",94,,
904,0.97,7015.608,7027.787,Not only have President Trump's policies been a disaster but his election and Presidency have actively emboldened right wing pop Youism.,94,,
905,0.97,7027.787,7050.543,"Congratulations to all the left Progressives and socialists around the country who were elected or reelected last week, including the election of Cory Bush and Jamal Bowman and the reelection of Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez.",94,,
906,0.97,7050.543,7080.773,"Trump has been a historically abysmal, deeply unpopular President who should have been easy to defeat, especially in the context of his criminal mishandling of the response to the pandemic top quote the Guardian newspaper quote, Trump should have lost in a landslide but no blue wave materialized millions more people voted for Trump than in 2016 and it became disturbingly clear that even if Trump himself is booted from office Trumpism is alive and well.",94,,
907,0.97,7080.773,7081.04,Unquote.,94,,
908,0.97,7081.04,7101.26,"And Trump almost certainly could have been Handily defeated had the Democrats not gone all out to crush Bernie Sanders and viciously reject the most popular parts of his platform like Medicare for all, taxing the rich instead of working people and exposing Trump for selling out his working people for historic tax cuts.",94,,
909,0.97,7101.26,7116.943,That would have been a platform that could have United tens of millions of working people and young people across race and other divisions and wiped Trump off the map but the Democratic party rejected it off hand in favor of defending the status quo.,94,,
910,0.97,7116.943,7125.685,"Exit polls show between 58% and 75% of voters who voted for Biden report that their vote was primarily a vote against Trump, not for Biden.",94,,
911,0.97,7125.685,7149.609,In reality Trump and the Republicans of course represent an agenda extremely hostile to ordinary people and racism and bigotry but the tragic reality is there is no strategy include the Democratic party to fight these ideas and we need a party that represents the interests of tens of millions of people and a party that will help build mass movements.,94,,
912,0.97,7149.609,7154.614,None of which the Democratic establishment have been willing to do.,94,,
913,0.97,7154.614,7155.414,Two very sobering statistics.,94,,
914,0.97,7155.414,7159.152,About 40% of households with a union member went for Trump.,94,,
915,0.97,7159.152,7174.0,"This is the best margin for a Republican since 1984 which was the election that gave Ronald Reagan his second term and another fact, Trump got the highest support from voters of color of any Republican candidate in 60 years.",94,,
916,0.97,7174.0,7191.25,It is clear that it's an extremely risky strategy for the Democratic party to refuse to take up progressive issues that will push back against the right wing drawing in working people who are angry at corporate politics and end up voting Republican because they feel they have no other choice.,94,,
917,0.97,7191.25,7201.227,No one should be surprised that several establishment Democrats whose campaigns refused to stand for any progressive issue either lost their seats or very narrowly won.,94,,
918,0.97,7201.227,7222.982,"All through the primary the Democratic party claimed that rejecting Bernie Sanders and his campaign platform would help them in these so-called down ballot races and shockingly now those same establishment Democrats are blaming their losses on or their near losses on Progressives, on socialists and on the black lives matter movement for their own failures.",94,,
919,0.97,7222.982,7230.222,"In contrast, for example, every single Democratic candidate who cosponsored Medicare for all in a swing district kept their seat.",94,,
920,0.97,7230.222,7245.204,"Which again is no surprise given that polls have consistently shown a majority of the U.S. electorate is considerably to the left of both party Leaderships on issue after issue, environment, electoral reform, Medicare for all.",94,,
921,0.97,7245.204,7251.377,An exit poll done on November 3RD by Fox news showed 72% of voters want Medicare for all.,94,,
922,0.97,7251.377,7257.817,"Even in states that went to Trump, progressive ballot initiatives won by wide margins.",94,,
923,0.97,7257.817,7264.39,In Florida a $15 minimum wage ballot measure was approved by voters by more than 61%.,94,,
924,0.97,7264.39,7274.1,In every state that had marijuana Legalization measure every state won that kind of measure and many of those are deep red States that went for Trump.,94,,
925,0.97,7274.1,7287.48,The New York Times quotes Congressman Ocasio-Cortez expressing her frustration with the Democratic establishments attacks and their view of looking at progressive issues as the enemy.,94,,
926,0.97,7287.48,7290.249,"Quote, I don't even know if I want to be in politics.",94,,
927,0.97,7290.249,7297.056,"It's the lack of support from your own party, it's your own party thinking you're the enemy.",94,,
928,0.97,7297.056,7299.058,You meaning she's Referencing Progressives.,94,,
929,0.97,7299.058,7317.743,So Trumpism will not end with Trump unless working people build independent fighting mass movements and begin to build our own party for the working class and unless we do that right wing populism and far right forces are likely to grow under the corporate administration of Joe Biden and the Democratic party.,94,,
930,0.97,7317.743,7340.399,"We need to build movements to fight against austerity and the budget cuts that will loom from all across States and cities for the green new deal, for Medicare for all and to hold police accountable across the country.",94,,
931,0.97,7340.399,7340.866,Thank you.,94,,
932,0.97,7340.866,7342.001,Thank you so much.,95,,
933,0.97,7342.001,7346.138,Any comments or questions on that report?,95,,

940,0.97,7371.297,7383.442,One appointment to the Pike place market preservation Council and one appointment to the Chinatown International district preservation authority governing Council.,96,,
941,0.97,7383.442,7401.961,This last week I was able to join the Maritime industrial work group which had several really great presentations and again I'll highlight that we have here in the city of Seattle a unique competitive advantage with our Maritime industry as we have the closest fresh water port to the Gulf of Alaska.,96,,
942,0.97,7401.961,7408.801,This coming week I'll be joining the District Council for their regular monthly meeting.,96,,
943,0.97,7408.801,7413.305,Here in district 6 I continue to host district 6 resident meetings every week.,96,,
944,0.97,7413.305,7436.395,"During my resident meetings last week we continued to discuss public safety, homelessness, transportation, stay together blocks and I spoke to residents in Ballard, West woodland, woodland Park, crown Hill, loyal heights and the Greenwood, Phinney is such a unique ridge.",96,,
945,0.97,7436.395,7438.397,Met with a lot of folks last week.,96,,
946,0.97,7438.397,7445.271,And I continue to meet with residents every week if you'd like to join me please sign up on the form on my Website.,96,,
947,0.97,7445.271,7449.508,We're scheduling about two weeks out at this time.,96,,
948,0.97,7449.508,7466.826,"Thank you Council President, thank you colleagues and thank you to all the black women in the United States that made this last election getting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris elected.",96,,
949,0.97,7466.826,7468.794,Any comments or questions on that report?,97,,
950,0.97,7468.794,7479.839,Hearing none we'll go ahead and hear now from Council member Herbold and then I will conclude with my report.,98,,
951,0.97,7479.839,7480.339,Council member Herbold.,98,,
952,0.97,7480.339,7493.819,What we have on the agenda today on the full council agenda is one bill from the public safety and human services committee that is Council bill 119945.,99,,
953,0.97,7493.819,7498.49,This is related to civil service commissions.,99,,
954,0.97,7498.49,7508.901,"The intent of the, the effect of the ordinance is to address the, how public safety civil service Commission members are elected.",99,,
955,0.97,7508.901,7517.376,"One of the three members of the public safety civil service Commission is elected by relevant employees, specifically police and fire.",99,,
956,0.97,7517.376,7530.689,Things are slightly delayed by Covid-19 so this allows the city clerk to hold the election in December rather than November and allows for electronic ballots rather than physical ballots.,99,,
957,0.97,7530.689,7547.439,"This is only for 2020 and it is included in the ordinance, not captured in the municipal code to express the temporary nature of the change.",99,,
958,0.97,7547.439,7556.215,It also eliminates outdated language in the code regarding the election process and allows the city clerk to modernize the election process by rule.,99,,
959,0.97,7556.215,7561.52,That's all that is on the full council agenda from my committee.,99,,
960,0.97,7561.52,7571.664,Just as I do every week I give my props out to Seattle fire Department for their Covid-19 test administration.,99,,
961,0.97,7571.664,7588.314,"At four sites throughout the number and the number of tests being delivered by the fire Department up through November 7th starting June 1ST is 331,000 tests administered by the Seattle fire Department.",99,,
962,0.97,7588.314,7607.666,"Echoing some of the comments by my colleagues today as it relates to Covid-19 transmission, there was a Washington State Department of health statewide situation report last week which shows as we have noted that Coronavirus transmission is increasing throughout Washington.",99,,
963,0.97,7607.666,7614.306,The case counts in Western Washington have been increasing in all age groups since mid September.,99,,
964,0.97,7614.306,7627.219,And this suggests that no single transmission route is driving trends and Covid-19 is well dispersed across the population.,99,,
965,0.97,7627.219,7631.623,Growth in cases is particularly pronounced in the 25 to 39 and 40 to 59 age groups.,99,,
966,0.97,7631.623,7644.803,"For folks who are making plans for the holidays like I know we all are, please keep in mind the best way to protect your friends, families and communities, wear masks around people that you don't live with.",99,,
967,0.97,7644.803,7647.806,Even if those folks are close family and friends.,99,,
968,0.97,7647.806,7651.61,Limit the number in size and frequency of gatherings.,99,,
969,0.97,7651.61,7652.611,Wash your hands frequently.,99,,
970,0.97,7652.611,7666.692,Stay home if you're sick and if you think you've been exposed call your doctor or visit Kingcounty.Gov/Covid/Testing for free testing appointments.,99,,
971,0.97,7666.692,7673.298,Another reminder that enrollment for health insurance is November 1ST through January 15th.,99,,
972,0.97,7673.298,7682.941,King County health insurance navigators are offering personal help with the enrollment process at Kingcounty.Gov/Coverage.,99,,
973,0.97,7682.941,7692.618,You can all for health access and insurance questions.,99,,
974,0.97,7692.618,7692.918,187565437.,99,,
975,0.97,7692.918,7699.958,This general topic brings me to some of my election reflections.,99,,
976,0.97,7699.958,7718.077,Really appreciated Council President Gonzalez's comments about social distancing as it relates to celebrations despite how Overjoyed I was with the election results another one of my strong reactions was concern about Covid transmission during celebrations.,99,,
977,0.97,7718.077,7737.729,And more on election reflections I'm so encouraged that this week has started off Monday morning with a press conference from President-elect Biden turning his primary focus on the creation of a Federal Covid-19 response and his insistence that mask wearing not be a political statement moving forward.,99,,
978,0.97,7737.729,7750.008,With this outcome of the Presidential election I'm so hopeful that cities and States are no longer on their own to to address our greatest public health challenge in a century.,99,,
979,0.97,7750.008,7762.821,"As far as activities for me, I have the water shed resource inventory area 9 meeting this week.",99,,
980,0.97,7762.821,7778.036,"And just reflecting over last week, letting folks know here that I presented at the community police Commission in response to their request for Council to inform them on the Council's budget actions regarding policing in Seattle.",99,,
981,0.97,7778.036,7781.707,Had really good discussion with the members of the CPC about that.,99,,
982,0.97,7781.707,7793.886,Last week I also received a briefing from chief Diaz on policy changes related to crowd control that the police Department announced last week.,99,,
983,0.97,7793.886,7803.462,This got some attention in the media the policy changes that they announced fall into five different categories.,99,,
984,0.97,7803.462,7811.837,One being recognizing the visibility presence and appearance of officers at a demonstration can impact interactions with the crowd.,99,,
985,0.97,7811.837,7815.574,And reducing the Department's present when safe and feasible.,99,,
986,0.97,7815.574,7826.718,"Two, they are intending to take additional measures to provide media legal observes and safe avenues to carry out their important roles.",99,,
987,0.97,7826.718,7829.755,"Three, they're working to Deescalate whenever it's safe and feasible.",99,,
988,0.97,7829.755,7833.892,They're improving means of conveying public safety messages to large crowds.,99,,
989,0.97,7833.892,7842.868,They are working on new strategies to address individuals taking unlawful actions and otherwise lawful crowds.,99,,
990,0.97,7842.868,7855.614,I had this briefing with chief Diaz and captain Leslie Courter in last week.,99,,
991,0.97,7855.614,7888.68,It was after the protests that I think many of us saw last week where an individual was hurt during the implementation Commission of an arrest and one of the things I really struggled to try to understand from my briefing on these changes is how changes in written policy are resulting in changes in decision making in Realtime.,99,,
992,0.97,7888.68,7904.329,We can clearly see they are using a new public safety communications device that is clear and apparent.,99,,
993,0.97,7904.329,7928.854,For things like reducing the visible presence and appearance at officers and demonstrations in their own understanding that large numbers of police can have impacts on interactions with crowds.,99,,
994,0.97,7928.854,7935.16,I have a hard time seeing the outcome of that policy change on the ground.,99,,
995,0.97,7935.16,7948.273,We saw many dozens of police officers responding to what appeared to be a protest of approximately looked like 20 people.,99,,
996,0.97,7948.273,7974.566,I'm going to try to understand how policy changes are implemented and how they actually result in different responses by the police Department when it comes to managing crowds of folks who are engaged in their rights of free speech and you know some of the policy changes I understand also are going to have to go through the consent decree process.,99,,
997,0.97,7974.566,7980.806,But some of these policy changes the police Department is saying they are implementing now.,99,,
998,0.97,7980.806,8004.763,I look forward to working with my fellow Council members on understanding more about what it means to implement these new policies and what it means when new policies have supposedly been implemented but that we're not seeing the changes we expect from those new policies.,99,,
999,0.97,8004.763,8024.649,Lastly I just want to mention that this week on Thursday I'm going to be participating virtually in a district 1 town hall organized by the Democratic socialists of America and that town hall is focused on public safety and the police Department budget.,99,,
1000,0.97,8024.649,8025.183,Thank you.,99,,
1001,0.97,8025.183,8032.157,Thank you Council member Herbold.,100,,
1002,0.97,8032.157,8033.325,Any comments or questions?,100,,
1003,0.97,8033.325,8042.134,"Council member Herbold, had a question about the Council bill 11945 just so I understand it better.",101,,
1004,0.97,8042.134,8058.917,I know several of you worked very hard on the landmark police accountability ordinance in 2017.,101,,
1005,0.97,8058.917,8061.887,The public safety civil service Commission.,101,,
1006,0.97,8061.887,8087.646,It's my understanding that this bill does provide an opening to flexibility in case that part of the accountability ordinance can be implemented later.,101,,
1007,0.97,8087.646,8090.248,Having the employee on the Commission.,101,,
1008,0.97,8090.248,8104.863,This particular bill is focused on allowing the public safety civil service Commission to constitute itself under the current requirements.,102,,
1009,0.97,8104.863,8126.685,It does not create any long term conflicts around our efforts to reform the appeals process if that's what you're getting at as contemplated under the 2017 accountability ordinance.,102,,
1010,0.97,8126.685,8127.085,Thank you.,103,,
1011,0.97,8127.085,8130.388,Any other questions or comments?,104,,
1012,0.97,8130.388,8131.49,"Council member Mosqueda, please.",104,,
1013,0.97,8131.49,8135.127,Thank you very much Council member Herbold.,105,,
1014,0.97,8135.127,8146.371,I appreciate all you have been doing to bring to light some of the not only policy considerations but the I think disparity between what we're hearing and what we're seeing.,105,,
1015,0.97,8146.371,8162.988,I too have had a chance to have a conversation with chief Diaz as we have a few times during the budget process so that I can give a heads up on some of the things that we are hearing as problematic to let folks know we'll be moving forward on various pieces that Council members have proposed.,105,,
1016,0.97,8162.988,8173.231,In my discussion I believe it was last Friday as well I had heard that there was a difference in the approach that police were taking.,105,,
1017,0.97,8173.231,8183.041,But I specifically asked if this was policy in writing and can you clarify for me?,105,,
1018,0.97,8183.041,8190.782,Is there changes that were directed in writing or is this something they're thinking of as a philosophical change?,105,,
1019,0.97,8190.782,8195.287,"Council member Mosqueda, that's a good question.",106,,
1020,0.97,8195.287,8209.668,That's the part at which I was trying to understand better from SPD in my briefing.,106,,
1021,0.97,8209.668,8210.201,There wasn't a report.,106,,
1022,0.97,8210.201,8220.378,There was a Blotter post that the media has reported on and in that Blotter post it identified these five changes.,106,,
1023,0.97,8220.378,8227.385,And I've asked whether or not there are policy changes in it writing and there are going to be policy changes in writing.,106,,
1024,0.97,8227.385,8246.471,Those are going to go through the consent decree process which means they're reviewed by the monitor and the DOJ and brought to the judge and there's an opportunity for our accountability partners to weigh in on those written changes and policies.,106,,
1025,0.97,8246.471,8254.613,In my briefing there was discussion that some things will have to go through the consent decree process and some things won't.,106,,
1026,0.97,8254.613,8262.053,Some of those things that don't have to go through the consent decree process they're implementing now.,106,,
1027,0.97,8262.053,8277.936,"Even if they're, it just seems to me that we all are familiar with the police Department's 500 page odd policy manual.",106,,
1028,0.97,8277.936,8289.581,"Many of these items that, that go into the policy manual are things that have to be, you know, fleshed out beyond five bullets.",106,,
1029,0.97,8289.581,8296.154,I'm trying to figure out where there is a change that is going to be reflected in the policy manual that we can see now.,106,,
1030,0.97,8296.154,8310.568,If they are saying they're implementing some of these changes now I would like to review them in a way that is more expansive than a five bullet Blotter post.,106,,
1031,0.97,8310.568,8320.378,That's what I'm trying to figure out is which things are going to be going over here and which things are they doing now?,106,,
1032,0.97,8320.378,8321.313,"Well, very briefly.",107,,
1033,0.97,8321.313,8325.183,Thank you very much Council member Herbold.,107,,
1034,0.97,8325.183,8336.094,Appreciate you following that line of question to make sure there is information in writing that is not only transparent to us but members of the public and press as well.,107,,
1035,0.97,8336.094,8339.664,I really appreciate your leadership on that.,107,,
1036,0.97,8339.664,8351.109,"I do want to recognize some of their recommendations have to do with the safety of the police interactions with members of the media, legal observers and medics.",107,,
1037,0.97,8351.109,8393.084,"However, in the last few weeks as I mentioned to the chief I've heard a few reports of members of the press specifically being moved out of the way to very far distances and it is not the goal to prevent the press from being able to document what's actually happening so I think there's a lot of work that still needs to be done to ensure that yes members of the press, legal observers and medics are not harmed by activities of our police force but also that they are still able to both document the situation and be close to the action so that reporting can occur or the legal observing and medical services can also occur.",107,,
1038,0.97,8393.084,8395.754,Just wanted to flag that for you as well.,107,,
1039,0.97,8395.754,8397.222,Thank you.,108,,
1040,0.97,8397.222,8406.364,You have just reminded me of another issue related to the right of not just the media but the right of the public to observe.,108,,
1041,0.97,8406.364,8483.641,"We have an observers bill of rights that the council passed several years ago and it is all about the ability to observe and document police interaction with the public and in my viewing of some of the activities last week it appeared that the distancing of the public from the activities of the police Department in relation to the injured individual might not be consistent with the intent of the observers bill of rights which does establish that police Department can require a safe distance from sort of where the action is but the separation of folks in this particular instance seemed to be much beyond what would be considered a safe distance and then there was a lot of concern about the interference of police flashlights and lights with the efforts to take, to create photographic evidence.",108,,
1042,0.97,8483.641,8506.03,The shining of the lights on protesters who were trying to capture the what was happening made it impossible in some cases to do so.,108,,
1043,0.97,8506.03,8510.168,We need to preserve these precious rights that we have.,108,,
1044,0.97,8510.168,8527.018,The rights of folks to engage in first amendment activity while observing the law and not doing damage to our city.,108,,
1045,0.97,8527.018,8528.72,Or doing damage to people.,108,,
1046,0.97,8528.72,8546.07,But observing the first amendment rights of protests as well as the press' ability to document and the ability of people who are medics to assist folks in Harms way.,108,,
1047,0.97,8546.07,8547.505,So thank you.,108,,
1048,0.97,8547.505,8556.581,Any other questions or comments for Council member Herbold?,109,,
1049,0.97,8556.581,8576.167,I want to echo my thanks to you for continuing to make sure that we have all the information we need as our public safety chair and appreciate the on going work here and also just want to acknowledge the comments that were also made by Council member Morales.,109,,
1050,0.97,8576.167,8599.791,I too also echo those remarks and frustrations I think are shared amongst all of us in term the of our on going desire to want to make sure that we are first and foremost protecting people who are exercising their first amendment rights on the street whether it's media or protesters.,109,,
1051,0.97,8599.791,8606.097,Look forward to getting more information as it becomes available from it you Council member Herbold.,109,,
1052,0.97,8606.097,8606.664,Appreciate that.,109,,
1053,0.97,8606.664,8612.904,Colleagues in terms of my report I already reported what I needed to during my President's report.,109,,
