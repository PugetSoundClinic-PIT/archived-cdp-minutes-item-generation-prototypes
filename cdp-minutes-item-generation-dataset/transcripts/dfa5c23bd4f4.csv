71,0.97,425.992,449.549,I hope to discuss the rent control legislation that my office unveiled over the summer and legislation from my office giving the green new deal oversight board the opportunity to stop the pipeline movement by waving financial institutions bidding on city contracts to urge the city not to contract with banks and insurance companies that also back that infrastructure.,22,,
72,0.97,449.549,457.924,The climate conference ended with total inaction from the leaders of the capitalist world last week.,22,,
73,0.97,457.924,484.684,"Not only did they fail to take any action of any kind, even their pledges are only one fourth of what scientists say would be needed to hold global warming to know more than the critical 1.5 degrees above Preindustrial levels . A Last- minute amendment from India's Farright regime even removed language that advocated for phasing out or replacing it with phasing down.",22,,
74,0.97,484.684,493.392,"To be clear, even if the agreement had had high target and strong language, it would still be nothing but a smokescreen for the fact that it contains no action.",22,,
75,0.97,493.392,497.463,It is not simply political inaction or incompetence.,22,,
76,0.97,497.463,505.404,Capitalist world leaders are diametrically opposed to any measure that distracts the profits of major corporations.,22,,
77,0.97,505.404,513.312,Understanding this very simple fact will be a crucial lesson for the struggle to preserve life as we know it.,22,,
78,0.97,513.312,522.321,The world's biggest 60 banks have provided nearly $4 trillion of financing for fossil fuel companies just since the Paris climate deal in 2015.,22,,

80,0.97,536.335,563.663,"The stop the money pipeline movement which is what the legislation related to around the world demands that financial institutions like banks and insurance companies and their backing of fossil fuel industry projects like oil pipelines and natural gas Fracking, and they urge public institutions like the city of Seattle to refuse to do business with financial institutions with ties to the fossil fuel industry to put pressure on them to cut those ties.",22,,
81,0.97,563.663,607.173,"The ordinance from my office drafted by Eric Mcconaughey from city council central stop with the help of climate activists will support the stop the money pipeline movement by giving the green new deal oversight board the equality to rate banks and insurance companies that bid on city projects and rate those ratings as 20% of the criteria that the financials will use to select winning bids . My hope is that this bill will be ready for a vote at the meeting on November the 30th . If it is not ready for a vote by that meeting, we will discuss it in draft form but I do hope that we will be able to vote at the meeting.",22,,

84,0.97,633.332,647.146,"If this budget amendment passes, it will fully fund the recommendations for housing and the green new deal in the people's budget and the solidarity budget and will fund the housing and green new deal needs that working people much more towards the scale that the crisis demands.",22,,
85,0.97,647.146,656.756,"The budget amendment is self balancing, raising the funds by increasing the rate of the payroll expense tax on large corporations or the Amazon tax.",22,,

87,0.97,670.169,680.046,Many Councilmembers have applied about the need for new possessive revenues but we know that possessive revenue is not a mystery.,22,,
88,0.97,680.046,681.48,It is simply a question of political will.,22,,
89,0.97,681.48,704.036,"Councilmembers will have every opportunity to fully fund housing and green new deals to the scale that is necessary and that is commensurate with the demands raised by the people's budget and the solidarity budget but will need the political real to increase taxes from businesses in Seattle which is what this budget amendment goes to end I please urge Councilmembers or their staff, their budget leads, to discuss with my office if you want to look at details.",22,,

93,0.97,730.896,758.257,"We have learned that because of the tenants organized, not only has the struggle forest the landlord to rescind the rent increases for 2021 which is a major victory but it has not force them to verbally tell tenants that they can pay prorated or reduced rent for the next couple of months to get compensated for the rent increases they already paid before the fight back forest them to Resend it.",22,,
94,0.97,758.257,770.636,They told my office that they want to send a memo about this because they want to be assured that they will not be penalized for Prorating the rent and my office will be making sure that that happens.,22,,

152,0.97,1300.265,1333.031,"Moving on, just a quick mention of an item that INTERSECTS between our deliberations on the 2022 budget and some misleading statements in a Seattle times editorial over the weekend related to the police Department budget as proposed under the chair's balancing package.",26,,
153,0.97,1333.031,1371.036,"The chair's budget that we heard last week, first made public on November 9, reflects the input from the monitors letter, dated November 8. the items that the monitor Referenced in his letter that he recommended shouldn't be subject to cuts are actually not cut in the budget . You would not understand that, I don't think that, if you had read the references in the times today.",26,,
154,0.97,1371.036,1382.781,The times article makes it sound like the chair's budget cuts the items that the monitor's letter requests that we consider not cutting.,26,,

158,0.97,1449.014,1465.063,"The very purpose of the meeting that Greg had, as requested by Council, was to represent the Council to see if there are questions about the proposals and to be able to discuss the budget proposals in detail.",26,,
159,0.97,1465.063,1480.879,This is very similar to a process that we used with a recent supplemental budget action . Greg Doss and the city attorney's officer met with the monitor.,26,,

Spu, with more frequent sidewalk trash cleanup . We will also be doing more Street outreach . I think we have all heard there has been a lot happening there and really wanted a chance to meet directly with the neighbors and the business owners as well as the community safety folks there.",33,,
237,0.97,2305.903,2318.582,My office has engaged with Spu to request much-needed garbage pickup at 12th and Jackson and for them to add the area as an emphasis route on their clean cities work.,33,,

240,0.97,2350.047,2371.168,I know folks are understandably really concerned about retail vacancy in little Saigon and I would welcome conversations with other city departments or outside stations that are looking for ways to activate the spaces there as we try to navigate this economic downturn that has been brought on by the pandemic.,33,,

246,0.97,2420.117,2450.748,Out of that meeting came some ideas around perhaps emulating the corner Greeter program that we have in the Ranier Beach neighborhood as well as for the Department of neighborhoods to work with local residents and the local business community to see how to activate some of the space around that building . It is not just the space under the platform but the laundry site behind it and the vacant parking lot.,33,,
247,0.97,2450.748,2476.173,There was a lot of things that are contributing to some of the challenges there . I hope to have additional ongoing conversations with the next Mayor about the office of housing and the Department of neighborhoods can stimulate activation in that space as we wait for the development to start . neighbors are really frustrated by the slow movements with the city.,33,,
248,0.97,2476.173,2477.074,I share their frustration.,33,,
