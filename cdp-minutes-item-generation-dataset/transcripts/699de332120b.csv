78,0.97,349.148,351.451,It has been an amazing journey.,21,,
79,0.97,351.451,359.225,Our City Council showed a lot of courage in saying we can make this work some four years ago.,21,,
80,0.97,359.225,369.602,I'm here to tell you today that we are making it work and we are on the last steps of turning Thi arena into one of the most beautiful arena's in the world.,21,,

83,0.97,381.347,381.814,This is one group.,21,,
84,0.97,381.814,394.394,We can go to the first slide that we don't have to remind folks as to what state this arena was in.,21,,
85,0.97,394.394,395.561,A state of decline.,21,,
86,0.97,395.561,399.198,This is a shot from the South side of the building.,21,,
87,0.97,399.198,402.869,It was Dysfunction Shownnal for concerts.,21,,
88,0.97,402.869,406.372,That hole at the side of the building is how trucks could load in and out.,21,,
89,0.97,406.372,409.575,Two trucks at any given time.,21,,
90,0.97,409.575,412.979,There were significant challenges.,21,,
91,0.97,412.979,417.683,At its core this was a landmark and for good reasons as the next slide shows.,21,,
92,0.97,417.683,427.66,"This building, if we can move to the next slide, went through various Iterations.",21,,
93,0.97,427.66,439.472,"In 1962 it was the Washington state Coliseum Paul theory designed the building, part of a competition to design it.",21,,
94,0.97,439.472,443.709,The roof of the building was spectacular.,21,,
95,0.97,443.709,452.151,It Replicated a native American rain Act and served the community so well for many years and brought the Nba here.,21,,
96,0.97,452.151,465.264,Brought concerts but then because of Economics and other things it felt like it was obsolete and in 1995 it went through a renovation and by most measures it didn't work.,21,,
97,0.97,465.264,483.783,"Seven years after the renovation that the word started to--it started to be discussed that they needed a new arena if you look at this Rubik's cube, this community Ãšstruggled with having a first class arena for decades.",21,,
98,0.97,483.783,491.324,It was through the courage of the city Council and Revisiting once again to see if there would be bidders.,21,,
99,0.97,491.324,497.864,Bidders did step up and that was in 2017.,21,,
100,0.97,497.864,513.045,"Okay view group and I'm proud that they were led by my brother Tim, put forward a bold plan of not only holding that roof and maintaining the historic landmark but building a new roof underneath.",21,,
101,0.97,513.045,516.449,We have people calling it a renovation.,21,,
102,0.97,516.449,517.884,It's not a renovation.,21,,
103,0.97,517.884,521.153,It's a spectacular new arena being built under the roof.,21,,
104,0.97,521.153,524.624,"As the next slide shows, these renderings have come true.",21,,
105,0.97,524.624,532.365,That which you saw in the South side of the building is now gone.,21,,
106,0.97,532.365,536.502,We have a loading dock pushed underground.,21,,
107,0.97,536.502,536.936,500 parking stalls.,21,,
108,0.97,536.936,546.712,"One of the things I love about the building, not just the grand Plaza but the impact that the building has on Seattle center.",21,,
109,0.97,546.712,552.385,"The impact on one of the great city's treasures, this beautiful park.",21,,
110,0.97,552.385,557.89,"Sometimes renderings don't quite hold true to what is happening, but this is a good depiction of what is happened.",21,,
111,0.97,557.89,565.398,You see the South end and the only piece added on to the building was a grand Atrium that creates circulation of the building.,21,,
112,0.97,565.398,573.172,That parking lot that became part of the grand Plaza and the building is quite spectacular.,21,,
113,0.97,573.172,578.544,I believe that this is the world most beautiful arena.,21,,
114,0.97,578.544,581.38,And we can justify that in many different ways.,21,,
115,0.97,581.38,582.315,I will show you.,21,,
116,0.97,582.315,587.52,The next slide is an interior shot of the arena.,21,,
117,0.97,587.52,591.591,These were renderings but these renderings have come true.,21,,
118,0.97,591.591,593.759,Those stands are going to be filled.,21,,
119,0.97,593.759,597.263,The response from the community has been spectacular.,21,,
120,0.97,597.263,607.206,"The idea two score boards where we wouldn't have a jumbo square board in the middle Bifurcating the arena but two pushing the end, fantastic.",21,,
121,0.97,607.206,609.442,They are on the floor being constructed.,21,,
122,0.97,609.442,611.877,I will show you a picture of that in a moment.,21,,
123,0.97,611.877,617.249,One of my favorite parts of the building is the reappearance of the glass on both ends of the building.,21,,
124,0.97,617.249,619.085,We are looking North here.,21,,
125,0.97,619.085,624.156,"That glass was part of the original design, spectacular part of the design.",21,,
126,0.97,624.156,626.359,In the '95 renovation it disappeared.,21,,
127,0.97,626.359,629.562,The seating bowl was placed in front of the glass.,21,,
128,0.97,629.562,632.765,It now reappears and it's one of the great parts of this building.,21,,
129,0.97,632.765,638.037,"When people walk in, they will walk in from that upper Concourse.",21,,
130,0.97,638.037,638.804,It's literally four stories down.,21,,
131,0.97,638.804,647.48,"Part of what happens is we didn't get greedy with suites, put in additional levels of premium seating.",21,,
132,0.97,647.48,650.182,We kept the bowl tight and intimate.,21,,
133,0.97,650.182,653.119,That's not only what the fans want but the players and the artists want.,21,,
134,0.97,653.119,657.757,This is one of the most intimate seating bowls of any arena in the world.,21,,
135,0.97,657.757,659.859,I will show you additional pictures.,21,,
136,0.97,659.859,666.699,What you are seeing above the bowl is an acoustical treatment that will make the concert Halper effect.,21,,
137,0.97,666.699,676.142,This dream that we showed you some 3 1/2 years ago has come true and allow me to show you additional slides of the current conditions.,21,,
138,0.97,676.142,686.352,"So, the day the building opens, it will open in a park, trees were preserved and one of the greatest assets of the building it connects to this beautiful park.",21,,
139,0.97,686.352,689.755,People on the upper deck will walk in.,21,,
140,0.97,689.755,695.528,"Their seats will be 12 rows above them but this is what they walk out to, an incredible park.",21,,
141,0.97,695.528,699.131,It couldn't be more proud of the name on the building and what it stands for.,21,,
142,0.97,699.131,702.535,We didn't put a corporate name on the building.,21,,
143,0.97,702.535,710.943,We drafted a partnership with Amazon to make this the first zero carbon arena in the world.,21,,
144,0.97,710.943,713.512,And that's easier said than done.,21,,
145,0.97,713.512,714.547,We eliminated all fossil fuel.,21,,
146,0.97,714.547,723.189,We had to change the way we tipped the building to the ice that the players skate on will be Rainwater collected from this very roof.,21,,
147,0.97,723.189,726.692,We are so proud and this is now creating a trend.,21,,
148,0.97,726.692,731.564,"In the second year of our operation, no single use plastic in the building.",21,,
149,0.97,731.564,741.24,"At the end of the every year we will certify to a not for profit agency that we are, indeed, a zero carbon facility building.",21,,
150,0.97,741.24,744.31,On the front end of the building are solar panels.,21,,
151,0.97,744.31,747.78,I will show you the Northgate project in a moment.,21,,
152,0.97,747.78,751.584,It's one of the largest solar installations in the entire state.,21,,
153,0.97,751.584,757.156,"The name on this building gave us incredible, incredible mission.",21,,
154,0.97,757.156,771.637,"In fact, our first event will be a global event to honor Sustainability and Seattle takes its rightful place, the center of Sustainability on a global basis and we couldn't be more proud.",21,,
155,0.97,771.637,774.607,The next slide shows how the building is coming along.,21,,
156,0.97,774.607,778.077,This is the front entry of the Alaska Airlines Atrium.,21,,
157,0.97,778.077,783.816,The picture on the right is one of four Snorkles.,21,,
158,0.97,783.816,798.297,Hvac couldn't be connected to this roof or punched through so we created four distinct Snorkels on the exterior of the building that act as Ingress and he AGREES opportunities for our fans.,21,,
159,0.97,798.297,800.933,I love the picture on the bottom.,21,,
160,0.97,800.933,804.27,Where there was dirt and construction it's being cleaned up.,21,,
161,0.97,804.27,809.308,Floors are being polished and we are getting ready for the opening of the building which will happen in mid-October.,21,,

165,0.97,829.195,831.463,The next slide shows the interior of the bowl.,21,,
166,0.97,831.463,838.204,There are twin score boards that we are so excited by those and what they represent.,21,,
167,0.97,838.204,849.114,"You know, the score boards were needed for the people with center ice seats or certain court seats but for people on the end and that is what this delivers.",21,,
168,0.97,849.114,851.35,On the upper right the acoustical treatment.,21,,
169,0.97,851.35,860.392,It will be concert perfect because there are millions of dollars spent on a baffling system not just on the roof but throughout the entire building.,21,,
170,0.97,860.392,866.565,And what you are seeing in the middle is the press box acoustical treatment.,21,,

181,0.97,937.736,943.842,"And, so, she is thrilled to be coming here as are some of the other artists.",21,,
182,0.97,943.842,966.598,"We have an opening week planned without revealing the specific details, our first event will be a private concert to honor the men and women who built this arena, through Covid and thick and thin, the men and women of the trades that built the most beautiful arena in the world and the first event will be here to honor them.",21,,
183,0.97,966.598,985.451,On Friday night we will open with a global concert broadcast throughout the globe by Amazon that will focus on Sustainability with a world renowned musical artist group and then that Saturday night will be inaugural game for the Seattle Kraken.,21,,
184,0.97,985.451,991.824,The big part of when we took on the next slides address transportation.,21,,
185,0.97,991.824,998.263,We worked hard to be good neighbors and I'm so proud that we had no litigation on this project.,21,,
186,0.97,998.263,1005.17,We didn't have one challenge on the is and we haven't had one legal challenge throughout the whole process.,21,,
187,0.97,1005.17,1010.843,A lot of pundits said it wasn't possible to build a project like this in a neighborhood and not have challenges.,21,,
188,0.97,1010.843,1015.948,We have tried to build in a super responsible way.,21,,
189,0.97,1015.948,1017.716,We cared a lot about transportation.,21,,
190,0.97,1017.716,1025.057,One of the things that we have done which no team has done is we embedded Inn Orca pass in our tickets.,21,,
191,0.97,1025.057,1031.597,"When you buy a Kraken ticket, you have an Orca pass on your device.",21,,
192,0.97,1031.597,1038.203,"People will come, we hope using public transportation but a significant issue for us is the Monorail.",21,,
193,0.97,1038.203,1044.743,The system that was still largely a tourist attraction that didn't even accept the Orca pass.,21,,
194,0.97,1044.743,1048.28,The next page shows you what we are doing with the Monorail.,21,,
195,0.97,1048.28,1065.564,We entered a partnership with Tom and were able to go to the city and gain an extension on the concession based upon the fact that we would take the Orca pass and invest dollars to revitalize the West side station and that's a rendering of the West Lake station.,21,,
196,0.97,1065.564,1076.341,Modern and the basement of the station is where sound transit arrives and this last mile is such an important part of our transit plans.,21,,
197,0.97,1076.341,1093.459,"It opens up not only thousands of parking stalls in Midtown but connects us to our transit system which, by the way, when it's open, East to West will be as large as Washington, D.C.'s Metro system.",21,,
198,0.97,1093.459,1098.263,That's not the only thing we are doing on transit.,21,,
199,0.97,1098.263,1107.039,From this Monorail plan to today will be purchased 20 Petacaps and everything in between.,21,,
200,0.97,1107.039,1114.213,We have taken transportation serious not just because it's important to the Economics of the building but to our fans and we are proud of what we have done here.,21,,
201,0.97,1114.213,1121.42,The other piece that we want to update this group is on the work to build a training center in the city.,21,,
202,0.97,1121.42,1124.323,The city of Seattle did not have one sheet of ice.,21,,
203,0.97,1124.323,1133.198,"If we were serious about bringing a professional hockey team here, we felt it was important that we create a home for ice sports in the city of Seattle.",21,,
204,0.97,1133.198,1139.104,We didn't want to build a training center in some distant suburb or a business park.,21,,
205,0.97,1139.104,1145.544,We very much wanted to build a training center in the city.,21,,
206,0.97,1145.544,1154.319,"It was accessible, where we could encourage diversity and inclusion in the game of hockey and that's what we have done.",21,,
207,0.97,1154.319,1156.355,The next slides will show.,21,,
208,0.97,1156.355,1160.092,We can go to the next slides.,21,,
209,0.97,1160.092,1160.792,Simple facts.,21,,
210,0.97,1160.792,1162.794,"We are building about 170,000 square foot facility.",21,,
211,0.97,1162.794,1167.099,We will draw more people to this facility than we will our games.,21,,
212,0.97,1167.099,1169.601,And our games are sold out.,21,,
213,0.97,1169.601,1176.742,"We are programmed for 20,000 hours of programming from Curling to figure skating to hockey to recreational skating.",21,,
214,0.97,1176.742,1184.55,We will have an incredible bar and grill that will honor the game and sport.,21,,
215,0.97,1184.55,1186.685,Home of hockey in Seattle and home of the Kraken.,21,,
216,0.97,1186.685,1189.988,I will share with this group something that recently happened.,21,,
217,0.97,1189.988,1199.064,We are in the final discussions with the women's U.S. Olympic team about making this their home before they head to the Olympics.,21,,
218,0.97,1199.064,1203.468,The dream is coming true and we are so proud.,21,,
219,0.97,1203.468,1214.98,We hope that future Kraken players that train on this ice and we hope that future young men and women that want to participate in figure skating and be in the Olympics will train here.,21,,
220,0.97,1214.98,1221.82,This was a big bet that our owners made but I'm super proud how this is developing as the next slides will show you.,21,,
221,0.97,1221.82,1225.958,We are proud of our partnership with Starbucks.,21,,
222,0.97,1225.958,1233.665,They didn't put their name on it but their muscle behind it because they loved our story about diversity and inclusion.,21,,
223,0.97,1233.665,1245.043,"This is a place that kids will come never thinking that they could play hockey because of the barriers, perceived barriers and this will be the home to take their first steps on the ice.",21,,
224,0.97,1245.043,1264.229,The Kraken community ice Plex is supported by Starbucks and we will have it on a Starbucks community store where 100% of the net proceeds from that store will go back to community even Rushment including giving kids the chance to play the game and figure skate.,21,,
225,0.97,1264.229,1272.371,"The renderings of the exterior of the building, a Virginia masonry medical clinic, serve our players and the community.",21,,
226,0.97,1272.371,1277.276,And the next slide shows the terrific exterior work.,21,,
227,0.97,1277.276,1288.22,This is a beautiful facility on the interior but remarkable on the exterior capable of being a center piece of the redevelopment of the Northgate Mall.,21,,
228,0.97,1288.22,1290.322,We are super excited about that.,21,,
229,0.97,1290.322,1294.826,"The last slide starts to show--the last couple of slides, that is the 32 bar and grill.",21,,
230,0.97,1294.826,1303.835,"You see the lobby on the upper right and then Rink one, which we are so proud of, 1,000 seats.",21,,
231,0.97,1303.835,1312.444,Everyone of the team practices will be open to the public and free.,21,,
232,0.97,1312.444,1317.249,Accessibility on the Northgate Light-Rail line and free parking.,21,,
233,0.97,1317.249,1319.818,Next slide shows some additional shots.,21,,
234,0.97,1319.818,1323.789,That is my shadow taking this picture.,21,,
235,0.97,1323.789,1328.026,That is the front Entryway.,21,,
236,0.97,1328.026,1329.628,That is our lobby.,21,,
237,0.97,1329.628,1330.328,Next slide.,21,,
238,0.97,1330.328,1332.731,"More shots of the exterior, shots of the interior.",21,,
239,0.97,1332.731,1341.339,These are rails that look in on the Rink and then the last slide is our beautiful Rink one.,21,,
240,0.97,1341.339,1343.608,"There is the 1,000 seats, beautiful Video.",21,,
241,0.97,1343.608,1346.511,Our team offices are up on the right.,21,,
242,0.97,1346.511,1354.386,200 people moving up to Northgate and then the team training facilities are just beneath that.,21,,
243,0.97,1354.386,1355.153,Spectacular training facilities.,21,,
244,0.97,1355.153,1363.095,We had the chance to take six players through during the expansion draft and they told all their friends that Seattle was now the place to play.,21,,
245,0.97,1363.095,1364.496,We are excited by it.,21,,
246,0.97,1364.496,1372.17,Let me tell you about the team and we can go right to the first slide--go to the next slide.,21,,
247,0.97,1372.17,1385.55,"About a week and a half ago, we unveiled our team to the world at an event at gas works Park, the perfect place not only to unveil the team but tell a positive story about our city.",21,,
248,0.97,1385.55,1393.158,It was broadcast on Espn and there were a million viewers of this hour and a half broadcast.,21,,
249,0.97,1393.158,1395.594,We didn't just introduce our team and share a vision.,21,,
250,0.97,1395.594,1399.431,We told the story of Seattle and what a beautiful city this was.,21,,
251,0.97,1399.431,1402.234,We Sot images around the city.,21,,
252,0.97,1402.234,1407.873,Our friends were the storm and sue Byrd introduced the players.,21,,
253,0.97,1407.873,1408.24,Let me pause.,21,,
254,0.97,1408.24,1420.452,This building is not only home to the Seattle Kraken but we have a fantastic relationship with the Seattle storm and soon the Nba will be coming back to Seattle and this building will be the perfect home.,21,,
255,0.97,1420.452,1423.822,First up is our hockey team.,21,,
256,0.97,1423.822,1426.424,So proud to pull our team together.,21,,
257,0.97,1426.424,1428.393,Only time will tell as to how we have done.,21,,
258,0.97,1428.393,1437.536,But I think we will have a fine team wearing this s proudly across their chests.,21,,
259,0.97,1437.536,1439.538,Camp begins in early September.,21,,
260,0.97,1439.538,1444.075,Our first Preseason games will be played around the state.,21,,

263,0.97,1455.654,1459.724,A few more things that we want to share early on.,21,,
264,0.97,1459.724,1462.694,We made a serious commitment to diversity and inclusion.,21,,
265,0.97,1462.694,1465.53,I have been in this business for 30 years.,21,,
266,0.97,1465.53,1471.002,Not a front office that truly represents like we are going to represent.,21,,
267,0.97,1471.002,1486.585,I'm very proud to report that 45% of our front office staff represent gender diversity and 25% of our staff represent diversity inclusion.,21,,
268,0.97,1486.585,1492.123,"Play by play, first African- American to call games in the history of the league.",21,,
269,0.97,1492.123,1504.803,The television team features a color analyst who is the first African-American to do color on a local broadcast and we are truly pioneering with our team and couldn't be more excited.,21,,
270,0.97,1504.803,1508.974,Community engagement is why I came back to lead this project.,21,,
271,0.97,1508.974,1509.508,I'm a community activist.,21,,
272,0.97,1509.508,1515.847,"I am proud of what we have done but we will be active every event, every game, everyday.",21,,
273,0.97,1515.847,1521.253,And then I talked a lot about our commitment to Sustainability.,21,,
274,0.97,1521.253,1524.256,I'm proud to answer any questions that you have.,21,,
275,0.97,1524.256,1526.458,I will say this on Sustainability.,21,,
276,0.97,1526.458,1534.332,One of the features of the arena are two signature walls on the main Concourse that will tell the story of the climate pledge.,21,,
277,0.97,1534.332,1536.635,One wall will tell the story of the climate pledge.,21,,
278,0.97,1536.635,1551.349,"The other will be one of the largest green walls and, in fact, it will be the only arena in the world that I know of that will have a full time Horticulturist on the staff to maintain the beautiful wall.",21,,
279,0.97,1551.349,1556.555,They will talk about Sustainability in an inspired sort of way.,21,,
280,0.97,1556.555,1558.623,That is the opportunity.,21,,
281,0.97,1558.623,1560.158,I moved through that quickly.,21,,
282,0.97,1560.158,1564.529,We will get this off to an incredible start but then the dreams begin.,21,,
283,0.97,1564.529,1567.732,A chance for the storm to play in the building.,21,,
284,0.97,1567.732,1570.735,They won two championships since they were out of the building.,21,,
285,0.97,1570.735,1583.515,"Now they get to call this their home, I think we will change the Wnba because of the storm playing in the building and their economics and then trust me, the Nba is watching what is happening here.",21,,
286,0.97,1583.515,1584.849,They are studying this arena.,21,,
287,0.97,1584.849,1593.491,They are watching the success that the Kraken had and they will come back to Seattle and this will be their home.,21,,
288,0.97,1593.491,1598.063,"With that, Chairperson, I'm happy to answer any questions.",21,,
289,0.97,1598.063,1600.198,"Before we get started, Mr.",22,,
290,0.97,1600.198,1601.066,"Leiweke, Todd, thank you.",22,,
291,0.97,1601.066,1622.12,"I know this, as you said, four years in the making and I really want to thank the Seattle city council that started some of this legislation, council member Herbold, Sawant were there in the beginning and Councilmember Mosqueda.",22,,
292,0.97,1622.12,1629.194,I know we had work with your office on the Seattle center but the Kraken community ice Plex.,22,,
293,0.97,1629.194,1636.768,"I want to thank you for work that you did with Light-Rail and working with sun transit, North Seattle college, Crawford.",22,,
294,0.97,1636.768,1642.374,"You hired a good friend of ours, former state representative Mr. Pedigrew.",22,,
295,0.97,1642.374,1653.885,"His work is great, reaching out to us and the community engagement that you have done and the work that we did with the Monorail and the Orca card and working with Mr. Alboro.",22,,
296,0.97,1653.885,1672.404,"I don't think people know behind the scenes the work we are doing to make sure that people get to the arena, trying to look at the Sustainability, not have a carbon Footprint, bringing in the sponsors and being true to the nature of Seattle and maintaining the original roof which people thought was very important.",22,,
297,0.97,1672.404,1677.342,"And, of course, accommodating a meeting and working with the Seattle storm folks.",22,,
298,0.97,1677.342,1687.852,"We often meet with the owners and we are excited as you know, Wnba, Seattle storm, four time Nash 23458 champions and hopefully a fifth.",22,,
299,0.97,1687.852,1691.022,"But other teams, particularly the Nba in our great city again.",22,,
300,0.97,1691.022,1694.993,"You know, you have been a great partner, you and your brother and all the other folks.",22,,
301,0.97,1694.993,1725.523,"I know that we have had--that is a Testament--we had some--we had a lot of work, not a lot of litigation which I'm happy and I'm happy that we got through the EIS and analysis that had to be done there and I know we have more neighborhood issues to tackle and you have been good about pledging money to youth care and other community groups and you did that early on and a lot of what you did without us or me asking and I want to thank you for that.",22,,
302,0.97,1725.523,1746.811,You have been great partners and hopefully in the next couple of years before I leave we can get a lot of this stuff done and I'm looking forward--I guess we are on track for the opening in October for the hockey when and the opening for the ice Plex will be opening at the same time is Light-Rail at Northgate as well.,22,,
303,0.97,1746.811,1747.145,Yes.,23,,
304,0.97,1747.145,1747.512,Okay.,24,,
305,0.97,1747.512,1757.355,"I will ask my colleagues if any of them, anyone has any questions that they may want to ask Mr. Leiweke while we have him here.",24,,
306,0.97,1757.355,1757.555,Okay.,24,,
307,0.97,1757.555,1760.458,It looks like we don't have anything here.,24,,
308,0.97,1760.458,1769.1,"If you want to end on any other NOTE we can say good-bye and thank you for your time coming here, Todd.",24,,
309,0.97,1769.1,1771.469,I appreciate your words.,25,,
310,0.97,1771.469,1774.772,The prow pride is which we have done it I hope is evident.,25,,
311,0.97,1774.772,1776.141,This is the city I love.,25,,
312,0.97,1776.141,1778.376,I believe the city's best days are in front of it.,25,,
313,0.97,1778.376,1782.68,We will do our part.,25,,
314,0.97,1782.68,1785.85,We want to win games but we have Ulterior motives.,25,,
315,0.97,1785.85,1800.231,"This is a project that has the potential to contribute to the well-being of the city, to lift people up at each and every event I tried to do that when I ran the Seahawks for close to eight years.",25,,
316,0.97,1800.231,1803.101,This was a chance to do something from scratch.,25,,
317,0.97,1803.101,1812.177,We have done everything we said and done it with pride and I think the best is yet to come.,25,,
318,0.97,1812.177,1823.588,I can't wait to take this group and others through the building as it finishes in October so you can see the brilliant work of not just the architects and engineers but the men and women of the trade that built this place.,25,,
319,0.97,1823.588,1826.391,I should have said that I had that in my notes.,26,,
320,0.97,1826.391,1829.527,I'm glad you brought that up.,26,,
321,0.97,1829.527,1837.101,We did several tours at the climate pledge.,27,,
322,0.97,1837.101,1839.971,Shot out to those that worked throughout the pandemic.,27,,
323,0.97,1839.971,1848.613,Everything has been done through the pandemic and you kept things moving.,27,,
324,0.97,1848.613,1849.047,I appreciate that.,27,,

329,0.97,1861.226,1863.027,That would be great.,30,,
330,0.97,1863.027,1863.461,Congratulations.,31,,

332,0.97,1867.765,1869.367,We will create thousands of jobs.,32,,
333,0.97,1869.367,1876.107,"You know what, in a world where there is so much acrimony, we have not felt it.",32,,
334,0.97,1876.107,1877.342,We felt community support.,32,,
335,0.97,1877.342,1879.31,The fans brought the tickets.,32,,

516,0.97,2668.899,2675.939,"As part of the phase 2, there was some findings for heavy metals found on site.",106,,
517,0.97,2675.939,2689.453,"So, that went into the conversations that we had with the owner to try to ensure that we had a plan for Remediating that and the cost of the property at this point is at $3.9 million.",106,,
518,0.97,2689.453,2693.39,For one acre.,107,,
519,0.97,2693.39,2694.324,"One acre, Yeah.",108,,
520,0.97,2694.324,2710.641,"Again, we have, I believe, six years left in the lease here so it will remain operating as it currently is operating which Givs us time to continue to work with the community and the other departments to create a final plan.",108,,
521,0.97,2710.641,2716.246,"So, we--this is also a culmination of the Waterworks with various partners.",108,,
522,0.97,2716.246,2727.724,We Reaccepted a grant conjunction with other folks with this purchase and looking for additional grant sources.,108,,
523,0.97,2727.724,2732.262,This is a pretty attractive project for the various grant authorities that we work with.,108,,
524,0.97,2732.262,2738.602,"So, we are confident that we will continue to see more but we have funding in our park fund that would cover this.",108,,
525,0.97,2738.602,2749.646,"Again, as I said before, once this is completed, then we will continue to work with Opcd and the community to look at a long term planning process.",108,,
526,0.97,2749.646,2754.118,"Seattle of city is putting in 2.9, then?",109,,
527,0.97,2754.118,2754.618,Yes.,110,,
528,0.97,2754.618,2757.287,That's how much we have allocated.,110,,
529,0.97,2757.287,2760.224,We are continuing to pursue other Fundings for this.,110,,
530,0.97,2760.224,2762.226,The county put in a million.,111,,
531,0.97,2762.226,2766.73,It was a grant.,112,,
532,0.97,2766.73,2768.398,"Grant, Okay, good.",113,,
533,0.97,2768.398,2771.735,"So, happy to answer any questions.",114,,
534,0.97,2771.735,2772.636,Straightforward for us.,114,,
535,0.97,2772.636,2777.941,Really unique opportunity to add to the parks and open space availability in that community.,114,,
536,0.97,2777.941,2786.45,"Happy to answer any questions and as I said, Elise is the expert and can answer any questions.",114,,
537,0.97,2786.45,2797.961,Probably good for Elise to briefly discuss the fifth amendment to the agreement and implications of that so everybody is well aware of what that agreement says?,115,,
538,0.97,2797.961,2798.795,Thank you.,116,,
539,0.97,2798.795,2799.429,Apologies.,116,,
540,0.97,2799.429,2800.097,I forgot to mention that.,116,,
541,0.97,2800.097,2802.566,She can Chime in and help.,116,,
542,0.97,2802.566,2821.451,"Because we identified these heavy metals on the site as part of the phase 2, we had already--because we believe there might be some substances there, we negotiated a $50,000 reduction in the purchase price with the owner that would then allow us to use the money to Remediate.",116,,
543,0.97,2821.451,2825.122,When we did phase 2 we estimated heavy metals.,116,,
544,0.97,2825.122,2829.226,"Roughly 80,000 to cover the cost of removing those.",116,,
545,0.97,2829.226,2834.998,The owner wanted us to absolve them of any responsibility for environmental issues at the site.,116,,
546,0.97,2834.998,2837.067,We did not agree to that.,116,,
547,0.97,2837.067,2846.376,What we agreed to do was to waive--absolve them of responsibility for the substances that we have actually identified.,116,,
548,0.97,2846.376,2862.893,"If anything else is found, they are on the hook but we agreed based on sort of our understanding of what is there, the reduced purchase price to allow them to--to give them a pass on the stuff we found but nothing new.",116,,
549,0.97,2862.893,2865.796,I don't know Elise if you want to add anything.,116,,
550,0.97,2865.796,2867.397,Sorry if I didn't cover everything.,116,,
551,0.97,2867.397,2875.005,The owner is still in the chain of title if there are any actions by outside parties.,117,,
552,0.97,2875.005,2884.314,"So, what I wanted to ask, Elise, did you draft the ordinance?",118,,
553,0.97,2884.314,2884.715,Who drafted it?,118,,
554,0.97,2884.715,2886.149,I started.,119,,
555,0.97,2886.149,2886.45,I had help.,119,,
556,0.97,2886.45,2888.085,I'm not an attorney.,119,,
557,0.97,2888.085,2890.387,I'm not trying to blame anyone.,120,,
558,0.97,2890.387,2910.841,"What I recognize, what I haven't seen in very many--I don't know if I have ever seen, maybe in resolutions but I haven't ever really seen an indigenous territorial land acknowledgment in recognizing Duwamish, Muckleshoot.",120,,
559,0.97,2910.841,2916.146,"So, when I was reading this, I was like who wrote this.",120,,
560,0.97,2916.146,2923.654,It was a could labor at this time effort with Ocpd because of the Duwamish program.,121,,
561,0.97,2923.654,2926.857,I didn't come up with that myself.,121,,
562,0.97,2926.857,2929.559,It seemed like a nice thing to put in there at the time.,121,,
563,0.97,2929.559,2929.826,It is.,122,,
564,0.97,2929.826,2939.202,I think this is something that we talked to Sam before he left on some of the language in some of the documents and the territorial acknowledgement.,122,,
565,0.97,2939.202,2940.537,"So, I appreciate that.",122,,
566,0.97,2940.537,2940.837,Thank you.,122,,
567,0.97,2940.837,2944.007,I very seldom see that.,122,,
568,0.97,2944.007,2945.575,I do appreciate that.,122,,
569,0.97,2945.575,2947.377,Councilmember Herbold has a question.,123,,
570,0.97,2947.377,2948.111,I see your hand.,124,,
571,0.97,2948.111,2949.947,I was going to do that.,124,,
572,0.97,2949.947,2954.818,You beat me to it.,124,,
573,0.97,2954.818,2956.019,"Go ahead, Councilmember Herbold.",124,,
574,0.97,2956.019,2965.128,"I want to--for superintendent, you said there was six months left--six years left on the lease agreements.",125,,
575,0.97,2965.128,2965.562,Is that correct?,125,,
576,0.97,2965.562,2966.029,That's correct.,126,,
577,0.97,2966.029,2976.873,Can you give us sort of a sense of the expected Timeline for the community planning process?,127,,
578,0.97,2976.873,2977.14,Yeah.,128,,
579,0.97,2977.14,2979.643,"Well, given that we have a good bit of time, we have time.",128,,
580,0.97,2979.643,2984.247,"What we will do, once this closes, we will work with Opcd.",128,,
581,0.97,2984.247,2986.416,There is lots of discussions already happening.,128,,
582,0.97,2986.416,2987.184,We will work closely.,128,,
583,0.97,2987.184,3002.265,"I don't have a specific Timeline but what I can do, once this closes, we can get together with the team and give you a more specific planned schedule here and one of the things--just to clarify, I believe it's six years that are left.",128,,
584,0.97,3002.265,3015.779,What we are looking to do is try to ensure the funding that is collected through the lease payments will be used both to deal with the remediation of the contamination as well as to maintain the prompted.,128,,
585,0.97,3015.779,3023.587,"Now, the other piece here that will be important to note is that we don't have development money for this site, of course.",128,,
586,0.97,3023.587,3029.092,That will have to be part of the longer term process as we envision this.,128,,
587,0.97,3029.092,3029.893,Thank you.,129,,
588,0.97,3029.893,3060.223,"I want to flag that whereas I recognize that the community engagement process takes time and even more so getting the development funding takes time, but should there be an opportunity for things to move more quickly, is there a possibility that the city could buy the current tenant out of their lease early?",129,,
589,0.97,3060.223,3063.627,That's a good question.,130,,
590,0.97,3063.627,3066.029,"I don't know, lise if you have specifics on the lease.",130,,
591,0.97,3066.029,3074.104,I don't have that information in terms of--obviously we will take the existing lease when we purchase it but I'm not sure about the details.,130,,
592,0.97,3074.104,3080.677,"There is language in the lease to that effect but more importantly, the city has a relocation policy.",131,,
593,0.97,3080.677,3084.414,"So, we could look to that as well.",131,,
594,0.97,3084.414,3084.848,"Thank you, Yeah.",132,,
595,0.97,3084.848,3095.358,"I just--I think I want the factors like the engagement, like the amount of time it takes to get funding for development.",132,,
596,0.97,3095.358,3104.968,"I would like that to drive the project, not the six years left on the lease if that makes sense.",132,,
597,0.97,3104.968,3105.335,Absolutely.,133,,
598,0.97,3105.335,3109.573,"No, completely agree with you, Councilmember, that is exactly where the starting point is.",133,,
599,0.97,3109.573,3118.715,"We want to do whatever we can to bring more parks and open space to the community that is in great need, particularly for open space.",133,,
600,0.97,3118.715,3129.192,"Legally, with this ordinance and the lease, there is nothing stopping us with what Council Herbold is bringing up to go back in for the remaining six.",134,,
601,0.97,3129.192,3130.861,Nothing stopping us from doing that.,134,,
602,0.97,3130.861,3137.868,"We could entertain that in the next year or so if need be, correct, legally?",134,,
603,0.97,3137.868,3138.101,Right?,134,,
604,0.97,3138.101,3148.378,"You can go back and amend a lease, changing conditions or raise more money or more input from Opcd.",134,,
605,0.97,3148.378,3150.247,Nothing would stop us from that?,134,,
606,0.97,3150.247,3152.983,We could stay on top of that.,134,,
607,0.97,3152.983,3153.817,Sure.,135,,
608,0.97,3153.817,3165.328,"And I don't know, lise if you have any insight into the current tenant if they are even looking to stay there for the remainder--they assigned a lease but they may be interested in leaving earlier.",135,,
609,0.97,3165.328,3169.399,Once we get this under title then we will have discussions.,135,,
610,0.97,3169.399,3171.268,That's always a discussion that comes up.,136,,
611,0.97,3171.268,3176.54,That's why I asked if it was private property when I looked at the ordinance and the memo.,136,,
612,0.97,3176.54,3183.713,It's different when it's private property as opposed to nonprofit or another government or s stop.,136,,
613,0.97,3183.713,3185.849,"When it's private property, there is more.",136,,
614,0.97,3185.849,3191.188,"But I'm glad you brought that up, Councilmember Herbold.",136,,
615,0.97,3191.188,3191.454,Okay.,137,,
616,0.97,3191.454,3196.426,"Is there anything else from you, Councilmember Herbold?",138,,
617,0.97,3196.426,3200.43,I had a few words to say when we are ready to vote.,139,,
618,0.97,3200.43,3200.931,No further questions.,139,,
619,0.97,3200.931,3204.568,I think we are wrapped up.,140,,
620,0.97,3204.568,3205.635,No other questions.,140,,
621,0.97,3205.635,3212.075,If there is anything else--no.,140,,
622,0.97,3212.075,3212.342,Go ahead.,140,,
623,0.97,3212.342,3212.776,We want to --,141,,
624,0.97,3212.776,3220.483,I was going to see if you had anything to add before I went to the vote if you had any closing comments.,142,,
625,0.97,3220.483,3221.017,Sure.,143,,
626,0.97,3221.017,3238.935,I want to say that I really appreciate that this is being brought to Council and thank the work of South Park community members that shared their vision for shoreline access and public space large enough for community gatherings consistently over the years.,143,,
627,0.97,3238.935,3252.415,This Park is used for really important local and regional festivals that bring together Indiginous people and South Park's Latinx and come BOD January community members.,143,,
628,0.97,3252.415,3265.495,"There is 5,000 feet of Duwamish River shoreline within a five minute walk for South Park residents but less than 400 feet of that 5,000 feet are public.",143,,
629,0.97,3265.495,3269.232,Only 100 provide access to the water.,143,,
630,0.97,3269.232,3278.375,"So, improved access to open space particularly to the sue Wham Mish River is one of the highest community priorities for South Park residents.",143,,
631,0.97,3278.375,3278.675,Thank you.,143,,
632,0.97,3278.675,3279.042,Thank you.,144,,
633,0.97,3279.042,3280.043,I'm glad you said that.,144,,
634,0.97,3280.043,3304.267,"A lot of what you shared, this is what brought my attention to what lise drafted in the actual ordinance talked about what you shared, about immigrant refugee families that live, work, worship on the lower Duwamish and equity and environmental agenda, Seattle's blueprint through environmental work identified in South Park as a focus area.",144,,
635,0.97,3304.267,3311.574,That is in the first page of the ordinance.,144,,
636,0.97,3311.574,3312.909,Not original thought E.,145,,
637,0.97,3312.909,3318.381,"I know, I'm just saying that it's glad when it's codified.",146,,
638,0.97,3318.381,3318.682,Thank you.,146,,
639,0.97,3318.682,3318.982,All right.,146,,

647,0.97,3337.133,3340.303,We are excited about this legislation.,147,,
648,0.97,3340.303,3367.063,I think it marries the recent land acquisition that we approved for affordable housing led by Duwamish housing with some of the commitments that the city has been wanting to expand for a while and specifically making sure that there is affordable housing developed where there will be a concentrated effort to combat displacement in South park.,147,,
649,0.97,3367.063,3375.505,"We are coupling affordable housing with priorities, community spaced priorities and making the area more resistant to climate change.",147,,
650,0.97,3375.505,3380.577,Excited for the legislation in front of us and enthusiastic yes.,147,,

653,0.97,3401.698,3405.235,I think this is a well written ordinance.,149,,
654,0.97,3405.235,3405.535,Thank you.,149,,
655,0.97,3405.535,3410.874,"With that, I'm going to move forward--Tracy, anything to add?",149,,

683,0.97,3477.774,3500.463,"Item 4, council bill 120140, ordinance relating to Seattle parks and recreation, authorizing the acquisition of real property commonly known as 3638 34Th Avenue South, authorizing acceptance of a recording of the deed for open space park and recreation purposes and rat at the identifying and confirming certain prior acts.",161,,
684,0.97,3500.463,3506.169,Introduce yourself and we will go through the ordinance again.,162,,
685,0.97,3506.169,3508.204,"Thank you, Jesus Aguirre.",163,,

689,0.97,3519.549,3523.92,Thanks for projecting this one.,165,,
690,0.97,3523.92,3527.457,"Councilmember if I may, thank you for the points on the legislation.",166,,
691,0.97,3527.457,3549.245,Up wanted to highlight the great effort of lise ward who is with me today who is an amazing sort of--amazing eye for these properties and is able to stick with them and continue to connect with all of the various owners and really allows us to have this kind of opportunistic acquisition.,166,,
692,0.97,3549.245,3557.32,This is an opportunity for us to add to an existing land bank site that is about to go out to bid for redevelopment.,166,,
693,0.97,3557.32,3565.295,I wanted to publicly thank lise with her work and stick wearing the owners to get a good deal for the city.,166,,
694,0.97,3565.295,3573.536,"This is the acquisition as you mentioned, Councilmember, in the North Rainier Valley in the Hub urban village.",166,,
695,0.97,3573.536,3609.405,"The Orange square you see on the 14R50Eud is our existing North Rainier land bank site that is moving forward with development and just to take a step back as Council knows, when we were required to make significant capital reductions to the budget as a result of the impacts on the budget from Covid and the pandemic et cetera, we put most of the land bank sites on hold except for this one, the one in South park and the one in the International district given the fact that these were serving communities in greater need than other areas in the city.",166,,
696,0.97,3609.405,3610.873,I'm proud that we can do that.,166,,
697,0.97,3610.873,3627.29,"Now we have an opportunity to add to that site by increasing it by approximately, again, just a little under an acre here and it's the little rectangle that is demarcated by that yellow arrow that shows you where the property is.",166,,
698,0.97,3627.29,3637.467,"North of that you will see is a seed project, Southeast development senior housing development.",166,,
699,0.97,3637.467,3652.715,"Part of the reason when lise saw this community, we wanted to jump on this, it allowed us---You will see in the next slide there is a Delapidated warehouse that sits on the property.",166,,
700,0.97,3652.715,3669.065,"The owner of the property had already begun to look for buyers to buy some--excuse me, build town homes and create this sort of blockade between us, the park and then this lower senior housing et cetera.",166,,
701,0.97,3669.065,3675.505,This was a good opportunity.,166,,
702,0.97,3675.505,3682.445,"This urban village has, in our gap analysis has open need for park space so this was a great opportunity.",166,,
703,0.97,3682.445,3684.247,You can see where it's located.,166,,
704,0.97,3684.247,3691.12,There is the warehouse that I mentioned.,166,,
705,0.97,3691.12,3694.023,The original property was appraised about $1.62 million.,166,,
706,0.97,3694.023,3697.36,We went back and forth and wanted to get the cost down.,166,,
707,0.97,3697.36,3701.23,We landed on a 2 Million-Dollar acquisition.,166,,
708,0.97,3701.23,3709.005,We believe it's a good price for this given that the owner has agreed to turn it over to us completely clean.,166,,
709,0.97,3709.005,3721.25,"So, they will Demolish this warehouse, they will Remediate the soil and make sure that we get it clean which I think is a great way to get the property back.",166,,
710,0.97,3721.25,3728.091,"Also, just like the prior property acquisition that you authorized, we continue to look for a funding grant for this.",166,,
711,0.97,3728.091,3742.538,"This is another one that the King County folks are excited about and are looking to get official funding and because this is an equity zone, this would qualify for Ctf money that doesn't require a match.",166,,
712,0.97,3742.538,3748.945,We could get the property without having to put in any matching dollars there.,166,,
713,0.97,3748.945,3751.18,"So, again, great opportunity for us.",166,,
714,0.97,3751.18,3761.023,It allows us to create sort of a public area there that Isn'Ting to be separated by market Valley town homes and add to the space.,166,,
715,0.97,3761.023,3765.128,Happy to answer any questions that folks have.,166,,
716,0.97,3765.128,3808.271,"I want to, like you said, lise, when we have these ordinances that we pass, like resolutions where you put in the language about--you did it again, and I appreciate about the North Rainier Hub and the need and the opportunity to have, if you have that kind of density to have green areas and parks because there are a large number of families and senior citizens that desire a future park use and the ability to get out and have green space and trees and we saw with the heat wave when you have no trees and it's hot and cement, you see this more in the density, the neighborhoods that don't have the beautiful green ways and boulevards and trees and water sheds and walk sheds.",167,,
717,0.97,3808.271,3811.641,When we create green space like this and parks I appreciate that.,167,,
718,0.97,3811.641,3818.581,"When you put the actual language in the intent in the ordinance, not just a resolution.",167,,
719,0.97,3818.581,3819.582,That is powerful.,167,,
720,0.97,3819.582,3821.384,"Thank you, lise and Jesus, thank you for doing.",167,,
721,0.97,3821.384,3833.896,This anything from my colleagues that they may want to ask regarding this acquisition?,167,,
722,0.97,3833.896,3834.263,Okay.,168,,
723,0.97,3834.263,3835.932,Sorry.,169,,
724,0.97,3835.932,3838.768,"Go ahead, Coast Guard Mosqueda.",169,,
725,0.97,3838.768,3839.635,Thank you so much.,170,,
726,0.97,3839.635,3843.306,Most of what I want to say is reiterating what you said.,170,,
727,0.97,3843.306,3855.585,I think that this is a great way for us to expand the open space in our communities that have long had access to lower access to parks and open spaces.,170,,
728,0.97,3855.585,3874.67,"I agree that buying this property that is situated next to affordable housing and multifamily senior housing will mean the Kiddos, Elders and family will be able to enjoy time together outside, which this is a positive thing for mental health as well as physical health.",170,,
729,0.97,3874.67,3892.021,And it bears mentioning that the majority of the Parkland that exists in Seattle exists in areas exclusively currently zoned for single family only detached housing which has a Long-Standing equity issue that we have been discussing in the land use committee as well.,170,,
730,0.97,3892.021,3894.523,Looking forward to supporting this legislation today.,170,,
731,0.97,3894.523,3930.026,"I want to thank members of the parks Department for working to help correct this Inquarter that we saw on full display when we looked at that tool kit, as we are analyzing the current urban strategy and continue to figure out the multiple layers and puzzle pieces that need to come together to address these inequities and right the historic wrongs, we are excited about legislation that helps open up access to areas where we can both build affordable housing and create green space because these are our backyards.",170,,
732,0.97,3930.026,3935.264,This is where family and friends play.,170,,
733,0.97,3935.264,3935.598,"So, excited.",170,,
734,0.97,3935.598,3936.666,Thank you.,171,,
735,0.97,3936.666,3940.903,"Again, Jesus and lise for writing in there.",172,,
736,0.97,3940.903,3956.852,"Following up what you said, Councilmember Mosqueda, they used the 2017 park plan, race, Ethnicity mapping among other criteria to identify priority areas for the long term acquisition strategy.",172,,
737,0.97,3956.852,3962.491,That is something that we have been working on since I have been in this job.,172,,
738,0.97,3962.491,3962.825,"So, 2016.",172,,
739,0.97,3962.825,3966.896,"So, to see this come to fruition is nice.",172,,
740,0.97,3966.896,3976.005,"Like I say, we can't always grow space but we can reclaim it and do something better with it for the public.",172,,
741,0.97,3976.005,3977.506,I appreciate that.,172,,
742,0.97,3977.506,3977.907,"Thank you, guys.",172,,
743,0.97,3977.907,3986.849,"Is there--what is confusing, we have Councilmember Mosqueda in person and a picture.",172,,
744,0.97,3986.849,3992.855,I have you on my phone in case I have to run upstairs to a sick baby but she put herself back down.,173,,
745,0.97,3992.855,3994.056,There is two of you.,174,,
746,0.97,3994.056,3996.292,That's why I didn't see you raise your hand.,174,,
747,0.97,3996.292,4003.666,I was looking at your other face.,174,,
748,0.97,4003.666,4003.866,Good.,174,,
749,0.97,4003.866,4007.87,"Councilmember Jarez, I believe Councilmember Herbold's hand is being raised.",175,,

751,0.97,4008.337,4009.538,Or is that an old hand.,176,,
752,0.97,4009.538,4013.376,"Is that is an old hand, sorry.",177,,

786,0.97,4084.747,4087.483,But before we adjourn --,195,,
787,0.97,4087.483,4092.521,"Councilmember Jarez I apologize, council member Mosqueda raised her hand.",196,,
788,0.97,4092.521,4093.856,Of course she did.,197,,
789,0.97,4093.856,4102.064,Active raising of the hand to see if I could get in the Queue for items before you adjourn today's meeting.,198,,
790,0.97,4102.064,4103.899,That's your moment.,199,,
791,0.97,4103.899,4105.901,Go ahead.,199,,
792,0.97,4105.901,4108.07,"Thank you, Madam chair.",200,,
793,0.97,4108.07,4108.838,Good to see you.,200,,
794,0.97,4108.838,4123.486,I wanted to use this as a quick chance to see if we might get an update from you on one of the biggest issues that I know is affecting many of the families that are interested in using our Wading pools.,200,,
795,0.97,4123.486,4130.292,"So many have written in with appreciation for opening the Wading pools, especially the weekend that it was so Dang hot.",200,,
796,0.97,4130.292,4142.104,But wanted to check in to see if we had any updates on the chlorine tablets and how we may be able to open more of the Wading pools for our Kiddos and families to play in.,200,,
797,0.97,4142.104,4146.642,Glad you brought that up because we did have a chlorine crunch there.,201,,
798,0.97,4146.642,4148.911,I will let the superintendent respond to that.,201,,
799,0.97,4148.911,4149.345,Thank you.,202,,
800,0.97,4149.345,4151.981,Thank you for the question.,202,,
801,0.97,4151.981,4157.052,I'm glad that our community members have been able to enjoy the Wading pools.,202,,
802,0.97,4157.052,4162.258,"Unfortunately, the chlorine specifically that we use in the Wading pools, the shortage has not gotten better.",202,,
803,0.97,4162.258,4170.499,At this point we feel like we have enough chlorine to maintain the operations for the remainder of the season in this curtailed schedule.,202,,
804,0.97,4170.499,4173.235,But we will continue to monitor.,202,,
805,0.97,4173.235,4174.837,We haven't seen any change so far.,202,,
806,0.97,4174.837,4181.911,At least we are confident we won't have to curtail the operations.,202,,
807,0.97,4181.911,4188.45,"So, that means that the pools that are open are the only ones that will remain open?",203,,
808,0.97,4188.45,4188.951,No additional openings?,203,,
809,0.97,4188.951,4189.285,Correct.,204,,
810,0.97,4189.285,4196.492,We are crossing our fingers to make sure that we can keep them going through the end of the season.,204,,
811,0.97,4196.492,4202.932,What are open in West Seattle?,205,,
812,0.97,4202.932,4204.6,Dell ridge.,206,,
813,0.97,4204.6,4205.067,Park elementary.,207,,
814,0.97,4205.067,4206.435,I was there today.,207,,
815,0.97,4206.435,4207.369,Winston park.,208,,
816,0.97,4207.369,4207.903,Okay.,209,,
817,0.97,4207.903,4209.071,"So, three.",210,,
818,0.97,4209.071,4210.439,I can pull them up.,211,,
819,0.97,4210.439,4216.946,"Yeah, I think we had some questions about Wading pools, too but we answered them through the constituents.",212,,
820,0.97,4216.946,4221.183,Could you pull that up quick for Councilmember Mosqueda.,212,,
821,0.97,4221.183,4223.552,I will put a plug in.,213,,
822,0.97,4223.552,4227.256,I went to the splash park in Highland park.,213,,
823,0.97,4227.256,4227.656,How fun is that.,213,,
824,0.97,4227.656,4231.56,I was you can taking about that.,214,,
825,0.97,4231.56,4232.561,I was there this afternoon.,214,,
826,0.97,4232.561,4232.895,Awesome.,215,,
827,0.97,4232.895,4237.166,I will say and we have a lot of work to do across the city.,216,,
828,0.97,4237.166,4243.105,If I had my Druthers I would convert them all to splash pads.,216,,
829,0.97,4243.105,4246.842,The sheer joy that children exhibit in these splash pads are great.,216,,
830,0.97,4246.842,4248.811,A little bit of both.,217,,
831,0.97,4248.811,4258.988,The parks Department had the Seahawks there a couple of weeks ago as well for their free lunch distribution.,218,,
832,0.97,4258.988,4261.223,"So, that was awesome.",218,,
833,0.97,4261.223,4263.726,All right.,219,,
834,0.97,4263.726,4266.528,"Sorry, I'm pulling them up.",219,,
835,0.97,4266.528,4271.667,I did learn something about the North Dell ridge Wading pool.,220,,
836,0.97,4271.667,4275.638,It closed earlier than the other pools which was a concern that I heard about.,220,,
837,0.97,4275.638,4292.588,My understanding is that you are required to have an extra long cleaning process for the water so that it doesn't drain the chemicals into the waterways around here and that specific Park is the reason it closes a little early.,220,,
838,0.97,4292.588,4304.8,I know it's hard for families that are getting off of work at 5:00 when the pool closes at 5:30 but that is the rational as I understood it.,220,,
839,0.97,4304.8,4306.669,Smaller pipes.,221,,
840,0.97,4306.669,4307.102,It takes longer.,221,,
841,0.97,4307.102,4311.874,"So, Yeah, unfortunately, that is a facility piece there.",221,,
842,0.97,4311.874,4319.648,In West Seattle we have Hiawatha.,221,,
843,0.97,4319.648,4326.021,"We have Lincoln Park, we have EC Hughes and sorry it want open up and Highland park.",221,,
844,0.97,4326.021,4330.492,"Those are on the Website, your park Website.",222,,
845,0.97,4330.492,4332.328,Willow Dell ridge.,223,,
846,0.97,4332.328,4333.328,Okay.,224,,
