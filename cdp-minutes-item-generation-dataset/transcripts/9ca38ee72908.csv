31,0.97,265.164,273.439,You may have seen the great news over the weekend that the city is going to be receiving an $11.2 million grant for the West Seattle bridge which is very exciting.,6,,
32,0.97,273.439,282.882,"Huge thank you to our delegation Senator Murray, Senator Cantwell, and our Congressmen.",6,,
33,0.97,282.882,287.887,"All of them were extremely, extremely focused and active to make this all happen.",6,,

35,0.97,301.1,304.704,Really exciting news as we start our infrastructure update with some good news from home.,6,,
36,0.97,304.704,314.013,"Let me just say that we are definitely in a very fluid situation, as I'm sure you all saw in the news.",6,,
37,0.97,314.013,322.221,The bipartisan agreement was announced the President immediately had to make some clarifying comments about it.,6,,
38,0.97,322.221,329.095,"So, as we are discussing this this morning, some of this is dynamic and changing.",6,,
39,0.97,329.095,335.935,"At the moment, it's really--we really don't have a ton of details.",6,,
40,0.97,335.935,341.441,Let me see if I'm able to hopefully move this along here.,6,,
41,0.97,341.441,343.509,"Okay, are you able to see that?",6,,
42,0.97,343.509,344.844,Okay.,6,,
43,0.97,344.844,347.213,Terrific.,6,,
44,0.97,347.213,358.257,"So, president Biden and a bipartisan group of senators have reached a deal on a $1.2 trillion infrastructure package.",6,,
45,0.97,358.257,367.834,"The infrastructure plan is really a modified version of the American jobs plans, and includes funding for roads, transit, bridges, Broadband, clean energy and water.",6,,
46,0.97,367.834,373.94,"There are definitely things that were included in the American jobs plan that are not included here, notably for example housing.",6,,
47,0.97,373.94,375.441,Is not a part of this plan.,6,,
48,0.97,375.441,392.191,"So, you're seeing the President and his remarks on Friday say that reconciliation, a reconciliation package is also going to be needed to address some of these additional, broader priorities.",6,,
49,0.97,392.191,401.667,The President on Friday of course said that he would veto legislation unless he received both reconciliation and the bipartisan package on his desk.,6,,
50,0.97,401.667,404.07,He has since walked that back.,6,,
51,0.97,404.07,420.386,"At this point, bipartisan, the bipartisan package and reconciliation are going to work in tandem, but it is not clearly necessarily that he won't sign the bipartisan deal unless he has reconciliation on his desk as well.",6,,
52,0.97,420.386,425.925,The details are really pretty light at the moment.,6,,
53,0.97,425.925,427.193,On the infrastructure framework.,6,,
54,0.97,427.193,439.038,"So, we are talking about approximately $579 billion in New spending over five years for a total of $1.2 trillion over eight years.",6,,
55,0.97,439.038,444.21,"So, a wide variety of kind of very top line numbers.",6,,
56,0.97,444.21,453.252,"As you talk to everyone from members onto staff, everyone is like you tell me what's in the package because I haven't seen it.",6,,
57,0.97,453.252,456.155,"So, it's this very high level.",6,,
58,0.97,456.155,458.024,$109 billion for roads.,6,,
59,0.97,458.024,460.059,We don't know what this means.,6,,
60,0.97,460.059,468.267,We expect to see legislative text around the week of July 12th.,6,,
61,0.97,468.267,473.372,Even the process for how they are going to develop it has not been identified at this point.,6,,
62,0.97,473.372,485.751,"The expectation of courses that the Senate plays the most important role on all of this, is that it's going to be very Senate heavy.",6,,
63,0.97,485.751,494.594,"If you're looking at legislation that has received bipartisan support in the past, on the Senate side, that will likely be the anchor for a lot of this.",6,,
64,0.97,494.594,497.897,"So, more details to come.",6,,
65,0.97,497.897,514.213,"Including of course in the elusive how we pay for it, really they sort of identified kind of a menu of potential sources of how much they are expecting Yackley what they are talking about with some of these high-level concepts I would call them.",6,,
66,0.97,514.213,518.184,Remains to be seen.,6,,
67,0.97,518.184,519.986,We will be sharing details as we get them.,6,,
68,0.97,519.986,526.626,"In the meantime, the house is moving along with their own court"" infrastructure package.",6,,
69,0.97,526.626,537.436,Starting with service transportation reauthorization which is going to be on the floor this week which is also getting combined with water infrastructure as well.,6,,
70,0.97,537.436,542.408,"So, the House has put together a drinking water and storm water and wastewater bill.",6,,
71,0.97,542.408,547.947,Those are being combined with a surface transportation bill.,6,,
72,0.97,547.947,551.35,"Again, that's going to be voted on in the House this week.",6,,
73,0.97,551.35,566.165,"One thing to note in the water infrastructure pieces a part of that is going to make permanent the low income household assistance program that you saw created in December, and then again funded through the American rescue plan to provide direct assistance to low income households with their utility bills.",6,,
74,0.97,566.165,570.269,That's being authorized to the tune of $8 billion per year.,6,,
75,0.97,570.269,579.345,"The service transportation bill, as you all know, the service transportation bill actually expired last year.",6,,
76,0.97,579.345,584.45,It has been continued for another year.,6,,
77,0.97,584.45,590.523,"On the Senate side, they have been moving along trying to proceed in a bipartisan fashion, and they have moved to divide it among many committees.",6,,
78,0.97,590.523,601.167,The Senate environment and public works committee has passed that on a bipartisan way.,6,,
79,0.97,601.167,622.188,"The Senate banking housing Committee, which oversees the transit portion, that is actually--they are probably not going to be able to move that portion of a bipartisan basis, but Senator Toomey, the ranking member from Pennsylvania, really conservative member.",6,,
80,0.97,622.188,628.728,They are probably not going to be able to move that through committee and that will just get folded in at some point with that bill when it comes to the floor.,6,,
81,0.97,628.728,635.401,"In the meantime, on the House side, they are largely moving their bill really on partisan lines.",6,,
82,0.97,635.401,644.41,The House and best act passed Tni committee by a vote of 38 to 26.,6,,
83,0.97,644.41,645.811,Only two Republicans voted for it.,6,,
84,0.97,645.811,647.68,It will be on the floor this week.,6,,
85,0.97,647.68,652.818,"Is not expected to receive very much Republican support, if any.",6,,
86,0.97,652.818,662.228,"So, that program authorizes $547 billion over five years for highways, transit, rail and safety programs.",6,,
87,0.97,662.228,665.064,"Of note, it includes, it's the first bill in 16 years to include Earmarks.",6,,
88,0.97,665.064,677.376,"So, Seattle working with Congresswoman Diane Paul and Congressman Smith was able to secure three projects in the bill.",6,,
89,0.97,677.376,681.38,One improvement for $2.3 million.,6,,
90,0.97,681.38,684.45,$1.8 million for the Georgetown to South Park connection.,6,,
91,0.97,684.45,688.988,"Than $750,000 to Mlk Junior way.",6,,
92,0.97,688.988,700.966,"Among the highlights for the house and best act, the chairman has really seen this as not just a transportation bill, but really a climate bill.",6,,
93,0.97,700.966,704.804,"So, has put in a number of resiliency measures.",6,,
94,0.97,704.804,709.608,Ranging from easy charge infrastructure to new carbon pollution elimination programs.,6,,
95,0.97,709.608,716.482,They've also tried to enact some of the President's priorities.,6,,
96,0.97,716.482,722.021,"For example, $3 billion for Reconnecting neighborhoods discretionary grant program.",6,,
97,0.97,722.021,733.599,"So, number of pieces that you have seen the President also highlight in his American jobs plan, are also included in the house and best act.",6,,
98,0.97,733.599,739.538,Just going back again on the Senate side just to highlight a couple items that were included.,6,,
99,0.97,739.538,749.915,"Given that the bill was bipartisan, I think one of the really impressive things is that they were able to get a number of climate provisions into that bill.",6,,
100,0.97,749.915,756.555,"So again, a $6.4 billion program, formula program to reduce transportation emissions.",6,,
101,0.97,756.555,762.261,A new $250 million Confection relief competitive program.,6,,
102,0.97,762.261,763.162,Ev charging.,6,,
103,0.97,763.162,768.667,That has received a lot of bipartisan support.,6,,
104,0.97,768.667,776.742,"For Senate Commerce, some really exciting things including $1 billion to implement vision zero safety plans, which is very exciting.",6,,
105,0.97,776.742,789.555,"$1.5 billion per year to actually authorize the, it's now called the race program, but it was the build program, and before that the tiger program.",6,,
106,0.97,789.555,792.458,"That program has actually never formally been authorized, it's always been through appropriations.",6,,
107,0.97,792.458,795.261,It really creates a permanent place for it.,6,,
108,0.97,795.261,798.097,"Then, just moving on to appropriations.",6,,
109,0.97,798.097,805.504,"As you all know and as we talked about, this is the first time that the house had tried to reinstate Earmarks.",6,,
110,0.97,805.504,812.978,"So, the House right now is in the middle of marking up their bills.",6,,
111,0.97,812.978,830.729,"Of the projects that are advancing, and that the committee accepted, we have $766,000 for a Healthone expansion program and then $400,000 for a renewable energy home heating conversion program.",6,,
112,0.97,830.729,835.234,The Senate is further behind.,6,,
113,0.97,835.234,839.205,Their process has been even more convoluted than the House's.,6,,
114,0.97,839.205,844.543,They have not even announced their MARKUP schedule at this point.,6,,
115,0.97,844.543,850.549,"Unclear also now with the infrastructure happening, how that is going to impact the Senate and their MARKUP process.",6,,
116,0.97,850.549,861.26,They are undoubtedly going to need to do another continuing resolution as the fiscal year expires September 30th.,6,,
117,0.97,861.26,871.036,I think the one to flight that is a potential lightning rod some of us are waiting on here in DC is the debt ceiling expires in early August.,6,,
118,0.97,871.036,878.978,"As you all may recall from a decade ago, it was a fight over the debt ceiling that got us to sequestration.",6,,
119,0.97,878.978,886.685,"I'm not saying we are going to see there again, but the debt ceiling seem to be a controversial hard vote.",6,,
120,0.97,886.685,895.194,Given all that is looming in the background I think everyone SEES that as one potential action mechanism to bring people to the table to continue negotiation.,6,,
121,0.97,895.194,901.1,The debt ceiling will be able to be attached to something to move forward.,6,,
122,0.97,901.1,914.313,"I like him I just want to mention on immigration policy, obviously the President has made Daca a huge priority.",6,,
123,0.97,914.313,919.084,"With Democratic majorities in the house and Senate, I think everyone is anxious to try to get something done on immigration reform.",6,,
124,0.97,919.084,931.063,Everyone is waiting to see what the Senate parliamentarian will rule on immigration and whether or not there are aspects of immigration reform that could potentially go on a reconciliation bill.,6,,
125,0.97,931.063,936.735,"In the meantime, of course, the House has already taken up the American dream of promise act.",6,,
126,0.97,936.735,937.937,The modernization act.,6,,
127,0.97,937.937,946.812,You're now seeing the Senate Judiciary hearing on these bills and him and to take action on these bills as well.,6,,
128,0.97,946.812,955.421,Part of that is very much about of course the issue of trying to get immigration reform through.,6,,
129,0.97,955.421,963.495,It also kind of helps to lay the foundation for wife the Senate needs to get rid of the filibuster because it's going to be very hard to get these bills through.,6,,
130,0.97,963.495,968.767,"So, kind of a two pronged strategy there in trying to push the through the Senate.",6,,
131,0.97,968.767,973.072,You are seeing the same thing of course on voting rights and for the people act.,6,,
132,0.97,973.072,976.775,We are watching these things really closely as well.,6,,
133,0.97,976.775,979.878,I'm going to stop there because I feel like I've thrown a lot out.,6,,
134,0.97,979.878,989.888,Happy to take any questions at all and Sierra please jump in if there is anything you wanted to mention that I have left out.,6,,
135,0.97,989.888,990.756,Okay.,7,,
136,0.97,990.756,991.657,"Thanks, Leslie.",7,,
137,0.97,991.657,994.093,That is a lot of information.,7,,
138,0.97,994.093,997.963,"Some good news, some not so great news.",7,,
139,0.97,997.963,1005.771,"But, looking for any hands raised . folks who may have questions.",7,,
140,0.97,1005.771,1009.708,I see that Councilmember Pedersen does have his hand raised.,7,,
141,0.97,1009.708,1012.177,"If other colleagues have questions, please don't hesitate to raise your hand.",7,,
142,0.97,1012.177,1013.812,Councilmember Pedersen.,7,,
143,0.97,1013.812,1016.515,"Thank you, Council President.",8,,
144,0.97,1016.515,1022.821,I just want to thank our office of Intergovernmental relations and Leslie for her expertise there on the ground in DC.,8,,
145,0.97,1022.821,1034.533,Because it is very convoluted process that they go through and it is made even more convoluted with the thin margin.,8,,
146,0.97,1034.533,1035.834,One extra vote in the U.S.,8,,
147,0.97,1035.834,1037.436,Senate for the Democrats.,8,,
148,0.97,1037.436,1041.407,Thank you for giving us this update.,8,,
149,0.97,1041.407,1044.843,We realize it is fluid and please let us know how we can be helpful.,8,,
150,0.97,1044.843,1046.311,Thank you.,8,,
151,0.97,1046.311,1051.65,"Okay, any other questions?",9,,
152,0.97,1051.65,1062.06,"Leslie, just sort of a 30,000 foot level question on some of these funding opportunities.",9,,
153,0.97,1062.06,1074.373,I see that there are specific projects within the city of Seattle that have been identified and earmarked for receiving Federal dollars.,9,,
154,0.97,1074.373,1090.889,"In all of the other categories in which there isn't Earmarking, but just categories of investments, I just want to get assurance from you that the city of Seattle can expect to receive direct grants from the Federal Government.",9,,
155,0.97,1090.889,1098.697,"And if you have a sense of how much that is, that would be great to know now.",9,,
156,0.97,1098.697,1104.703,I just want to get the assurance that we are not going to have to go through a state granting process for any of these dollars.,9,,
157,0.97,1104.703,1109.675,"So, I think it depends.",10,,
158,0.97,1109.675,1113.112,Candidly it's going to depend on some of the funding sources.,10,,
159,0.97,1113.112,1118.817,Some of them will come out through formula.,10,,
160,0.97,1118.817,1126.091,"Some of them will be things, particularly on the transportation bill, that you will work with Puget sound regional Council.",10,,
161,0.97,1126.091,1128.26,Some of them are going to be competitive.,10,,
162,0.97,1128.26,1134.233,Some of them will be competitive grants that the city will apply for directly to U.S. D.O.T.,10,,
163,0.97,1134.233,1137.736,It is a wide variety.,10,,
164,0.97,1137.736,1145.344,"I would say the one piece just in terms of managing expectations that I have not heard on the table, and don't anticipate being on the table is point.",10,,
165,0.97,1145.344,1149.114,It was so hard to get over the finish line.,10,,
166,0.97,1149.114,1155.621,I don't know that we will see another round of direct funding the way that we did in the American rescue plan act.,10,,
167,0.97,1155.621,1161.126,You are already seeing Republicans trying to make the move to Clawback some of those.,10,,
168,0.97,1161.126,1169.968,"I don't think that that is going to happen, but I haven't seen anything that says here is going to be this direct allocation to the city.",10,,
169,0.97,1169.968,1172.771,The way that we saw with the American rescue plan.,10,,
170,0.97,1172.771,1184.883,"There are going to be ample opportunities however for the city to compete for grants, and I would anticipate, given all the city is doing, around equity, around climate, that we will be incredibly competitive.",10,,

328,0.97,2266.864,2284.348,There was a sharp debate within the movement and Dave was one of the labor activists who argued that the movement needed to take to the streets to claim our rights and to protest the arrest and Jailing of hundreds of peace protesters.,27,,
329,0.97,2284.348,2293.991,"In the end, the decision was made to stage a large much from downtown, defying the Mayor, the police, and the political establishment in declaring this is what democracy looks like.",27,,
330,0.97,2293.991,2305.102,Dave mobilized and led a huge UFCW contingent that was part of a 6000 person March through downtown which set the political establishment and the police on their heels.,27,,
331,0.97,2305.102,2319.016,"Immediately following the successful March, hundreds of union members and community activists staged an occupation outside the King County Jail and stay there illegally under the Mayor's order.",27,,
332,0.97,2319.016,2322.787,It was legal under the Mayor's order I mean and tell all the protesters were released that weekend.,27,,
333,0.97,2322.787,2331.595,I recall Dave's vital early conditions because we need a revival of that kind of militant struggle inside the labor movement.,27,,
334,0.97,2331.595,2333.931,I'm reminded of that as I think about Dave's legacy.,27,,
335,0.97,2333.931,2336.834,Thank you.,27,,

362,0.97,2460.057,2473.07,"Thank you, Council president and thank you for your support and leadership on this as well.",36,,
363,0.97,2476.64,2483.614,"In terms of updates, I wanted to provide a few updates from the office of labor standards.",36,,
364,0.97,2483.614,2486.984,As folk may have heard there was breaking news last week.,36,,
365,0.97,2486.984,2497.661,The Office of labor standards announced a $3.4 million settlement with Uber under Seattle's gig worker paid sick and Worktime ordinance.,36,,
366,0.97,2497.661,2500.397,"15,000 workers.",36,,
367,0.97,2500.397,2513.711,"During the investigation, and after its conclusion, Uber voluntarily corrected the issues that were largely due to technical software glitches they say that impacted workers' access to paid sick and safe time.",36,,
368,0.97,2513.711,2518.082,The number of days and inadvertent cancellations of requests.,36,,
369,0.97,2518.082,2520.117,This is the largest settlement in Ols' history.,36,,
370,0.97,2520.117,2523.821,I would just add to that.,36,,
371,0.97,2523.821,2542.506,"I know that many of us who were on Counce at the time, myself, Gonzalez, number of other folks, were very excited about the opportunity to have worked on strengthening office of labor standards' funding for their investigation over the past four years.",36,,
372,0.97,2542.506,2549.747,This is something that I have bought for tremendously because we know how few investigators there are at the state level for workplace violations at the state level.,36,,
373,0.97,2549.747,2558.155,Emphasizing the importance of office of labor standards to have personnel and the opportunity to do individual investigations and Companywide investigations.,36,,
374,0.97,2558.155,2560.858,"Infect sector wide, director initiated investigations are really critical.",36,,
375,0.97,2560.858,2569.833,"Because it is often workers, workers of color, immigrant and refugee workers, women workers, who are more likely to experience workplace violations.",36,,
376,0.97,2569.833,2577.541,"In this case, drivers for Uber are often immigrant workers who may speak English as a second language as well.",36,,
377,0.97,2577.541,2584.581,Making sure that they have someone who is going to be investigating complaints that get brought forward in their industry is incredibly important.,36,,
378,0.97,2584.581,2598.495,The fact that $3.4 million is now on the kitchen table of the workers means that is not--means that it is circulating in our local community.,36,,
379,0.97,2598.495,2601.765,"It is helping to feed and clothe folks, it's helping to house and care for people.",36,,
380,0.97,2601.765,2606.904,This is dollars that would have otherwise gone to the company itself.,36,,
381,0.97,2606.904,2628.892,"Whatever the sort of justification is for how it got out to folks, the fact that we have this law on the books, is something that we all worked on in the last pandemic to make sure that those who are driving folks to grocery stores and driving them to medical appointments in this time of the pandemic that they have sickly protections as well was something that we can all be very proud of because it was a national standard that got upheld.",36,,
382,0.97,2628.892,2632.029,"Now, when we pass laws our expectation is that those laws will be adhered to.",36,,
383,0.97,2632.029,2633.664,"When they are not, there will be penalties.",36,,
384,0.97,2633.664,2638.535,There were penalties and frequent issued to working families last week.,36,,
385,0.97,2638.535,2648.045,It means that type of settlement will be a warning to other companies that they too need to make sure there is no glitches.,36,,
386,0.97,2648.045,2654.451,That they need to be making sure that their policies and practices are in line with the city ordinance.,36,,
387,0.97,2654.451,2669.833,This is something we know from the National employment law project that every time there is a workplace violation that is put out to the public more companies come into compliance because they too don't want to be in the same situation.,36,,
388,0.97,2669.833,2672.403,Suck my really proud of office of labor standards for this historic investment.,36,,
389,0.97,2672.403,2679.109,I'm proud of this Council and I was proud to be the prime sponsor on the legislation last year to help us create paid sick and safe leave for these gig drivers.,36,,
390,0.97,2679.109,2688.786,I am extremely proud to be standing in solidarity with the workers who brought up these violations to begin with.,36,,
391,0.97,2688.786,2689.386,"Again, $2.4 million.",36,,
392,0.97,2689.386,2690.587,A historic day.,36,,
393,0.97,2690.587,2697.661,"I know that I and others have had the chance to congratulate workers, myself and Council President Gonzalez had a chance to congratulate workers.",36,,
394,0.97,2697.661,2704.468,I just wanted to offer this note of congratulations publicly to them as well in the office of labor standards.,36,,
395,0.97,2704.468,2711.275,"Additionally, office of labor standards recently posted the commuter benefits fact sheet on its Website.",36,,
396,0.97,2711.275,2715.579,You can find that in more information about the domestic workers ordinance also on their Website.,36,,
397,0.97,2715.579,2733.097,"In related news, office of labor standards announced that the drivers Union collaborative, which consists of the Diapered Union and teamsters is the recipient of $5 million of awards to provide driver resolution center services from July first 2021 through July 31st of 2022.",36,,
398,0.97,2733.097,2750.948,"Driver resolution center service will include culturally and linguistically relevant outreach and education on labor standards, rights, as well as representation and Deactivation of disputes as outlined in the Tmc driver deactivation ordinance.",36,,
399,0.97,2750.948,2767.731,"Folks will remember this is also something that was nationally acclaimed for the work that we're doing, not only to pass legislation, but it's being led by workers and what they have pointed out is important to them by making sure there is a place for workers to continually go to raise issues and concerns and get resolution.",36,,
400,0.97,2767.731,2769.266,Congratulations to the drivers Union and teamsters 117.,36,,
401,0.97,2769.266,2777.775,"From Finance and administrative services, wanted to let you know that they are reviewing comments on the short-term rental platforms.",36,,
402,0.97,2777.775,2789.853,Comments that were provided during the recent public comment period and have advised short-term rental platforms that there current rules are going to remain in effect.,36,,
403,0.97,2789.853,2802.399,"Additionally, thanks to the consumer protections, customer service, and operational staff, the short-term rental platforms are increasingly blocking listings without valid city operator license.",36,,
404,0.97,2802.399,2815.412,"On one of the platforms, the number has declined from over 800 unlicensed--on operator licensed postings to less than 150.",36,,
405,0.97,2815.412,2818.282,"More work to do, but very exciting.",36,,
406,0.97,2818.282,2822.186,Wanted to let you know the things that are on my calendar.,36,,
407,0.97,2822.186,2826.323,Last week we did have the chance to attend the Association of Washington cities annual concerts.,36,,
408,0.97,2826.323,2828.125,Myself and Councilmember Strauss.,36,,
409,0.97,2828.125,2837.334,Had the opportunity to a participate in the annual conference and board meeting.,36,,
410,0.97,2837.334,2848.512,Very excited about the participation that we had a made member state of Washington's new leadership program which is with women who are interested in public policy and advocacy.,36,,
411,0.97,2848.512,2854.251,Every year I spoke to that group hosted by the University of Washington women's center.,36,,
412,0.97,2854.251,2865.963,I attended the AIA conference on building an equitable 15 minute city and participation with the South Seattle Chamber of Commerce.,36,,
413,0.97,2865.963,2870.968,We signed the Arpa legislation.,36,,
414,0.97,2870.968,2873.704,There was a great press conference with a number of colleagues there.,36,,
415,0.97,2873.704,2882.346,As we watched the Mayor sign the work that we have done over the last two months into law.,36,,
416,0.97,2882.346,2892.055,"I'm already getting messages from a number of people thanking us for the work we've done in asking how they can help--how they can apply for some of the small business assistance, Childcare support and direct cash.",36,,
417,0.97,2892.055,2894.091,Word is getting out about the important elements in that.,36,,
418,0.97,2894.091,2898.195,Lastly folk come I wanted to note something that's very exciting that's coming up.,36,,
419,0.97,2898.195,2909.306,"In partnership with Councilmember Strauss, we are excited that there will be a preliminary proposal for legislation that will be forthcoming later this summer, in August.",36,,
420,0.97,2909.306,2926.923,"In partnership with Councilmember Strauss who is a cosponsor with this, we are anticipating legislation this fall that could seek to change the name of zoning to be more inclusive in the preliminary proposal helps to move our zoning title to be in line with what has been recommended for years from the Seattle planning Commission.",36,,
421,0.97,2926.923,2937.267,This legislation constitutes a technical change of part of the annual comprehensive plan update that we are going to be engaging in over the next few months.,36,,
422,0.97,2937.267,2941.605,It recognizes that the term single-family is actually a misnomer.,36,,
423,0.97,2941.605,2944.341,It's a legacy that is more rooted in our Exclusionary zoning policies.,36,,
424,0.97,2944.341,2956.62,The reality is that Single- family or detached only zoning doesn't reflect the current makeup of our neighborhoods that have Duplexes and drive Flexes and Rowhouses and connected homes of courtyards.,36,,
425,0.97,2956.62,2962.359,Many places like my old apartment that I lived in in Queen Anne was a four story Brownstone.,36,,
426,0.97,2962.359,2971.368,"It would mean that if the structures were taken down, the zoning code has changed and shrunk over the years.",36,,
427,0.97,2971.368,2980.177,"Over the last 50 years it has made it so the structures would no longer be able to be there, and only a detached single structure could be there.",36,,
428,0.97,2980.177,2986.583,Many cities are going through similar efforts to create titles that allow for more inclusive zoning titles that can help mitigate the impact of Standalone only housing.,36,,
429,0.97,2986.583,2988.585,And detached only housing.,36,,
430,0.97,2988.585,3001.198,This legislation response to the Seattle planning Commission request since 2017 to change the name to neighborhood residential zoning as laid out in the neighborhoods for all report.,36,,
431,0.97,3001.198,3004.301,A request has been sent and reiterated by the planning Commission as well.,36,,
432,0.97,3004.301,3016.113,"Every year, and has also been called for by the Seattle city council in our conference a plan Docketing resolution every year since 2018.",36,,
433,0.97,3016.113,3052.249,"So, here we are in 2021 and this is our opportunity to listen to the ways in which community organizations, our planning Commission, the--the conversation at large across the country has continued to evolve to make sure that neighborhood businesses and departments and Rowhouses and courtyards--courtyard housing like the ones I talked about all can be both Replicated in different areas of our city to make sure that folks have more access to schools, services, and grocery stores.",36,,
434,0.97,3052.249,3057.454,And that we can have a zoning code that more accurately reflects the diversity of housing across our city.,36,,
435,0.97,3057.454,3067.264,"Multi generational households, inclusive housing, and different ways that people can live together in Seattle to hopefully create a more livable and affordable Seattle.",36,,
436,0.97,3067.264,3081.077,I'm excited that we are going to be building out the planning Commission's recommendation and recognize that historically the previous term has been used to further Exclusionary practices and has roots in discriminatory policy.,36,,
437,0.97,3081.077,3084.347,"So, this is our opportunity to show that language matters.",36,,
438,0.97,3084.347,3101.631,"While this is a technical change, it could help lead to a zoning designation that is more equitable and inclusive and accurately reflects the diversity of our neighborhoods and our diverse housing structure we have as we seek to create the company has a plan changes in 2023 in anticipation of the 2024 actions.",36,,
439,0.97,3101.631,3114.578,"Just a few notes about processing, again thanks to Councilmember Strauss for your leadership through the land use and planning committee.",36,,

447,0.97,3148.345,3151.748,In anticipation of broader changes that might be possible in 2023 and 2024.,36,,

478,0.97,3364.427,3372.268,"It's helpful to highlight that thanks to city government policies and funding from all levels of government, we opened Madison park to become home to many low income residents.",39,,
479,0.97,3372.268,3382.045,With the completion of the nonprofit solid grounds several years ago and the more recent elevation of the historic naval barracks.,39,,

481,0.97,3387.183,3391.488,"75% of those residents identify as black, indigenous, or people of color.",39,,
482,0.97,3391.488,3401.965,"While the nonprofit organizations that own and manage the buildings there are responsible to take care of the tenants, the city government that runs all of the park shares and this was possibility to fill any gaps.",39,,

503,0.97,3539.536,3551.447,One thing is that a few years ago a consultant found alarming evidence of major structural damage.,42,,

515,0.97,3633.429,3638.434,We just don't have any options.,42,,
516,0.97,3638.434,3651.014,At our Sustainability and Renters' rights committee last week we heard presentations from city council central staff from the next two bills in the Renters movements fight for a full bill of rights.,42,,

527,0.97,3753.85,3767.363,"Require landlords to pick up the cost of the trauma and dislocation because when they Evict tenants to rate increases, and that is also precisely what our city needs a strong rent control policy without corporate loopholes.",42,,

542,0.97,3863.226,3872.835,"Today's deadly temperature in the weekend as we have seen, are clearly a specter of climate disaster.",42,,
543,0.97,3872.835,3883.546,And illustrate that the Short- term profit motor that is the offense of global prophet capitalism on its most fundamental level is an existential threat to all of humanity.,42,,
544,0.97,3883.546,3897.46,"While the billionaire class can be forced to take some measures both for their profit and under pressure from mass resistance, and we will see some of that happening, it has been and will be, a day late and a dollar short.",42,,
545,0.97,3897.46,3915.511,"To have any hope of averting a full on capacity, we will need the International working class to take the fossil fuel banking and other sectors into Democratic public ownership to urgently shift into a global Socialist economy powered by clean, renewable energy.",42,,

547,0.97,3930.126,3941.504,This will be needed alongside a militant mobilization of the Union workers in the fossil fuel sector with the whole labor movement in solidarity to demand just transition and retraining for workers in the clean renewable energy economy.,42,,
548,0.97,3941.504,3968.764,"With the help of city council central staff, my office is developing legislation to give the green new deal oversight board the legal authority to rate insurance companies and other financial institutions to bid on city contract to enable the city of Seattle to join the International movement pledging not to do business with financial institutions that back the fossil fuel corporations that are endangering human life.",42,,
549,0.97,3968.764,3983.746,"I will be supporting the bill coming before the full city council this afternoon allowing larger affordable housing apartment buildings to be built on properties owned or controlled by churches, mosques, synagogues and other faith communities.",42,,
550,0.97,3983.746,3986.248,I wanted to specifically advocate for affordable housing in the central area.,42,,
551,0.97,3986.248,3998.861,A year ago this month I stood at the tax Amazon press conference outside new hope missionary Baptist church with a dozen clergy in many community activists.,42,,
552,0.97,3998.861,4010.406,"The Lehigh and Socialist demand that the city establishment support the central area housing plan, which has been developed by the Reverend Dr.",42,,

554,0.97,4016.112,4027.923,The clergy's housing plan including a demand that the city pass affordable housing plans.,42,,
555,0.97,4027.923,4035.531,I'm happy the bill is before us today but we also need to be clear that the zoning provisions that only a small part of what is needed to actually make the affordable housing come to life.,42,,
556,0.97,4035.531,4038.501,They also need to be funded.,42,,
557,0.97,4038.501,4043.706,We also need to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in affordable socially controlled housing.,42,,
558,0.97,4043.706,4049.545,"Zoning changes, while are necessary to facilitate construction, do not pay for it.",42,,
559,0.97,4049.545,4056.118,Over the years I've spoken with many faith leaders were eager to build affordable housing on the properties.,42,,
560,0.97,4056.118,4063.926,"As part of this movement, they understand keenly both the urgency and the moral mandate for Maura Cordova housing.",42,,
561,0.97,4063.926,4084.447,"At the tax Amazon press conference a year ago, we demanded that a portion of the Amazon tax, which was then Rebranded as Jumpstart, be dedicated toward building affordable housing in the central district through diverse racial Gentrification.",42,,
562,0.97,4084.447,4096.192,"This advocacy and they push from hundreds of committee members, we were able to win an amendment in that final bill to dedicate a portion of the Amazon tax each year toward central district housing.",42,,
563,0.97,4096.192,4100.696,This was an important accomplishment and definitely a victory for the black lives matter movement in the protests at that time.,42,,
564,0.97,4100.696,4102.498,We also know is not enough.,42,,
565,0.97,4102.498,4113.609,Reverend Jeffrey has explained how 50 years ago the city establishment at that time essentially forced the church to sell its land to the city.,42,,
566,0.97,4113.609,4122.518,"The fourth selling price under the city establishment's threat of taking it to imminent domain was $34,000.",42,,
567,0.97,4122.518,4125.988,This was an absolute travesty against sienna's black community.,42,,
568,0.97,4125.988,4128.023,That land today is worth more than $2 million.,42,,
569,0.97,4128.023,4133.429,At least a part of it needs to be developed into affordable housing.,42,,
570,0.97,4133.429,4144.64,"The church, in partnership with the low income housing Institute, has developed a plan to develop affordable housing for 87 households.",42,,
571,0.97,4144.64,4156.886,"Working-class black households with preference, community preference, for people who have been to placed or are threatened with displacement in the central district on the city's stolen property.",42,,
572,0.97,4156.886,4157.853,This project is urgently needed.,42,,
573,0.97,4157.853,4165.661,"Needless to say, Affordability is raging throughout the city.",42,,
574,0.97,4165.661,4183.579,Reverend Jeffrey has spoken eloquently about how the city needs to make reparations for its theft 50 years ago by giving back the land to the community and funding the $10.7 million that is needed to complete this Anti- Gentrification affordable housing project striking a blow for racial and housing justice.,42,,
575,0.97,4183.579,4189.552,And against racist Gentrification.,42,,
576,0.97,4189.552,4199.161,My office will continue to stand with the clergy and our entire community in demanding that the city Council and the Mayor's office commit to these investments without delay.,42,,
577,0.97,4199.161,4207.803,Last week my office sent to the clerk's office for introduction the legislation to Decriminalize Psychedelic drugs in Seattle.,42,,
578,0.97,4207.803,4216.979,I really appreciate the activists from Decriminalize nature campaign for speaking up and urging the city Council to support this legislation.,42,,
579,0.97,4216.979,4238.5,"As I explained last week, and before as well, the legislation uses the same legal approach that Seattle used to Decriminalize Cannabis shortly before it was legalized statewide by essentially saying that the enforcement related to Psychedelics would be made a last priority by the police Department.",42,,
580,0.97,4238.5,4241.837,Which was the approach used for Cannabis at that time.,42,,
581,0.97,4241.837,4256.752,"That is what this legislation will do with Psychedelics such as Shrooms, LSD, and--as I've mentioned in the past, I support Decriminalizing Psychedelics for several reasons.",42,,
582,0.97,4256.752,4268.03,"First, evidence is showing that the criminal justice system is a terrible response.",42,,
583,0.97,4268.03,4276.572,"The failed war on drugs did nothing but expand mass Incarceration, Decimating poor communities, especially communities of color.",42,,
584,0.97,4276.572,4280.009,"The Criminalization of Psychedelic drugs is only a small part of that, but it is a part.",42,,
585,0.97,4280.009,4284.847,That is a reason to do this.,42,,
586,0.97,4284.847,4291.587,More specifically there is significant research showing the Psychedelic drugs are very rarely harmful and can have significant benefits.,42,,
587,0.97,4291.587,4306.001,"They can have a powerful benefit research shows in some circumstances to treat depression and addiction and some of the drugs have a long history of use in religious ceremonies, especially in the indigenous communities.",42,,
588,0.97,4306.001,4312.775,This legislation would be most appropriately referred to Councilmember Herbold's committee.,42,,
589,0.97,4312.775,4320.215,Last week we sent the legislation to Councilmember Herbold to ask if that committee has the capacity to introduce.,42,,
590,0.97,4320.215,4333.829,It does not we can either report it to the committee that I chair or send it straight to the full city council.,42,,
591,0.97,4333.829,4337.399,I know Councilmember Herbold you may not have had a chance to review the legislation.,42,,
592,0.97,4337.399,4340.402,I'm happy to follow up with your office later today and tomorrow.,42,,
593,0.97,4340.402,4345.541,I know that you will be meeting with Decriminalize nature later this week.,42,,
594,0.97,4345.541,4350.846,Maybe we can talk then.,42,,
595,0.97,4350.846,4356.251,"If you do have a general sense of whether or not you are able to schedule this legislation your Committee, I would really appreciate knowing that.",42,,
596,0.97,4356.251,4358.654,Thank you.,42,,
597,0.97,4358.654,4361.356,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",43,,
598,0.97,4361.356,4367.563,"Councilmember Herbold, do you have any information for Councilmember Sawant now?",43,,
599,0.97,4367.563,4371.633,"If not, no worries.",43,,
600,0.97,4371.633,4375.637,I know that Councilmember Lewis has also spoken about this legislation.,43,,
601,0.97,4375.637,4382.878,I know that there is no less than three Councilmembers that have interest in this area.,43,,
602,0.97,4382.878,4386.915,"As Council President, I do think it makes sense to refer to the public safety and human services committee.",43,,
603,0.97,4386.915,4397.092,I am hoping that we can all have conversation about this particular legislation before I have to make a decision about where to refer it to.,43,,
604,0.97,4397.092,4400.863,"Thank you, yes.",44,,
605,0.97,4400.863,4404.333,I don't have a whole lot more to add other than what Councilmember Sawant already mentioned.,44,,
606,0.97,4404.333,4421.016,I am going to be discussing with Decriminalize nature . The thoughts about the timing of legislation as it relates to the strategy that we have all discussed before.,44,,
607,0.97,4421.016,4437.099,"Which is the consideration of this work as part of the drug Olicy reform work that the Overdose emergency--Oh, boy, I'm forgetting the name of the task force.",44,,
608,0.97,4437.099,4445.04,The new task force that met for the first time last week with several members of Decriminalize nature.,44,,
609,0.97,4445.04,4448.21,Sitting on the task force itself.,44,,
610,0.97,4448.21,4455.851,"So, I just want to make sure that we are observing the process for bringing forth this legislation.",44,,
611,0.97,4455.851,4464.126,That everybody thinks is most aligned with the goals of the legislation itself.,44,,
612,0.97,4464.126,4496.758,"So again, there is a broader conversation going on around drug policy reform . Since the ultimate efforts are really focused on state government for the Lex legislative session, I want to hear directly from the members of Decriminalize nature about their thoughts about how a potential Seattle ordinance would fit within that strategy.",44,,
613,0.97,4496.758,4499.294,Thanks.,44,,
614,0.97,4499.294,4500.762,Okay.,45,,
615,0.97,4500.762,4521.416,"I, and my office, will follow up with you, Councilmember Herbold, and Councilmember Sawant, on sort of next steps Procedurally so that we can make sure that we run as smooth of a process as we possibly can.",45,,
616,0.97,4521.416,4526.388,"So, sounds like there is more to come here.",45,,
617,0.97,4526.388,4529.758,"Councilmember Sawant, you're off mute, so I imagine you have something you would like to say.",45,,
618,0.97,4529.758,4540.802,"I'm looking forward to that conversation between your office, as President, and Councilmember Herbold as committee chair.",46,,
619,0.97,4540.802,4546.742,I agree with Councilmember Herbold that this legislation is not by itself.,46,,
620,0.97,4546.742,4564.126,"Decriminalize nature is itself, the whole idea has come about as part of the overall Drug- related policy . something that at least as a semblance of reflection, is not action.",46,,
621,0.97,4564.126,4572.067,"What we need is moving the drug policy toward what scientist, statistical evidence indicates.",46,,
622,0.97,4572.067,4578.24,"I would say as far as the legislation is concerned, there is a task force.",46,,
623,0.97,4578.24,4582.578,The city council is the city's highest legislative body.,46,,
624,0.97,4582.578,4586.281,It has higher authority than a task force and will be a far more democratic process.,46,,
625,0.97,4586.281,4591.587,"I would say that in that sense, it will be good and important.",46,,
626,0.97,4591.587,4599.962,"Good if the Council does it end important for the Council to set the tone, or help set the tone also, for the future conversation on this Drug- related policy.",46,,

637,0.97,4642.904,4651.546,I Kayaked out to them and picked them up and we Paddled back into sure.,51,,
638,0.97,4651.546,4657.919,"I do want to highlight for everyone listening that if you're out on the water, please wear your pfd and please do not swim outside of your comfort zone.",51,,

641,0.97,4677.572,4684.746,"What will happen is that then there will be two people to rescue, making the situation worse.",51,,
642,0.97,4684.746,4692.254,"Again, highlighting that Hypothermia will set in even on 110 degree days if you're in Lake Washington or Puget sound.",51,,
643,0.97,4692.254,4695.39,15 minutes.,51,,
644,0.97,4695.39,4698.66,The first thing to do if you go overboard is to get your breathing under control.,51,,
645,0.97,4698.66,4706.468,To avoid shock and involuntary gasping and panicked breathing.,51,,
646,0.97,4706.468,4715.377,"You have about 10 minutes from the time you're in the water to functionally self rescue by grabbing a rope, pulling yourself back onto the boat or at least stabilizing your head above water.",51,,
647,0.97,4715.377,4720.115,"After 10 minutes, most people's fine motor skills have stopped working.",51,,
648,0.97,4720.115,4729.224,"You might not feel cold, and it will be hard to do any functional tasks.",51,,
649,0.97,4729.224,4735.397,"So, from first hand experience this last weekend, I can tell you as a very strong Paddler, it was difficult to bring another human into sure.",51,,
650,0.97,4735.397,4746.842,"For everyone out there enjoying the water, please wear a pfd, swim within your comfort zone, and if you're going into assist someone else, make sure you have the proper equipment.",51,,
651,0.97,4746.842,4752.047,Thank you.,51,,

701,0.97,5043.505,5053.648,I could have offered these initial comments as part of Councilmember Strauss' report.,53,,
702,0.97,5053.648,5055.717,My apologies for being a little slow on the draw.,53,,
703,0.97,5055.717,5068.63,I'm just going to start with letting folks know that I am considering bringing back a couple of amendments that were discussed in the Land-Use committee.,53,,
704,0.97,5068.63,5085.38,Amendments to Council bill 120081 one amendment would lower the average affordable housing income threshold to 60% of AMI for rental households.,53,,
705,0.97,5085.38,5088.75,"Again, this is an average and not all units need to be at 60%.",53,,
706,0.97,5088.75,5105.8,"The second amendment that I'm considering bringing forward would increase the term of Affordability to 75 years, consistent with our requirements of developers as part of the Mha performance program.",53,,
707,0.97,5105.8,5114.876,Both of these amendments were discussed in committee and did not receive a pass recommendation.,53,,
708,0.97,5114.876,5126.221,"But, had a tie vote with two voting in favor and two opposed.",53,,
709,0.97,5126.221,5129.924,"So, I think this would be a good topic of discussion at full council.",53,,
710,0.97,5129.924,5146.641,"I want to just lift up the fact that the central area Land-Use review committee has contacted Councilmembers in support of these amendments, as has the low income housing Institute.",53,,
711,0.97,5146.641,5171.132,"We just really want to again underscore that this legislation has the potential to help meet community needs, but could do so even more effectively and fairly with these kinds of changes that are again, very similar to the expectations that we have of developers as part of the Mha program.",53,,
712,0.97,5171.132,5172.767,"So, just wanted to start off mentioning that.",53,,
713,0.97,5172.767,5175.87,"Then, moving on --",53,,
714,0.97,5175.87,5180.775,Councilmember Herbold--Council President may I --,54,,
715,0.97,5180.775,5194.155,"Since it is directly related to a matter that Councilmember Strauss just addressed as part of his report, why don't we go ahead and give Councilmember Strauss and opportunity to respond and then we can move on.",55,,
716,0.97,5194.155,5194.756,Thank you.,56,,
717,0.97,5194.756,5199.294,"I did seek out Councilmember Herbold, an attempt to get comments in on mine.",56,,
718,0.97,5199.294,5203.064,Thank you for the flexibility here.,56,,
719,0.97,5203.064,5208.903,"Councilmember Herbold, the intention of your amendments is welcomed, but at this time they are not amendments that I can support.",56,,
720,0.97,5208.903,5213.575,"I would say that we had robust discussion at Council, at my Council committee last week.",56,,
721,0.97,5213.575,5226.521,What is center to--what is center to the issue here is that we have a number of projects that are already in the works.,56,,
722,0.97,5226.521,5229.39,Understanding that the framework from the state that was passed to the city.,56,,
723,0.97,5229.39,5245.707,"That is why Councilmember Pedersen, and thank you Councilmember Pedersen, brought the amendment requesting the data for the additional, so we can come back in a year to see how these programs are being implemented and make adjustments at that time.",56,,
724,0.97,5245.707,5253.648,"If you wanted to include in your amendments and implementation date of one year out from here, that is something that I could consider talking to you about.",56,,
725,0.97,5253.648,5261.623,"That might move my hand from being in a position where I currently am, to support.",56,,
726,0.97,5261.623,5266.094,"Because as I said to Councilmember Pedersen in the committee last week, I am completely open to this conversation.",56,,
727,0.97,5266.094,5273.668,"It's just we need to--I'm open to having the conversation, I can't support these amendments.",56,,
728,0.97,5273.668,5285.546,"So, I can tell you that from what I've heard, that it would be very concerning for me to put forward these amendments on this bill today.",56,,
729,0.97,5285.546,5294.389,"What I would love to work with both of you on is how do we size this proposal, this legislation, for the future?",56,,
730,0.97,5294.389,5295.39,Thank you.,56,,
731,0.97,5295.39,5300.762,Councilmembers want?,57,,
732,0.97,5300.762,5310.605,I just wanted to comment briefly to say I will be supporting the amendments.,58,,
733,0.97,5310.605,5313.107,Okay.,59,,
734,0.97,5313.107,5315.576,Okay.,59,,
735,0.97,5315.576,5326.721,Are there any other committee members who want to give the rest of the Council the benefit of their discussion from committee?,59,,
736,0.97,5326.721,5328.723,Councilmember Mosqueda please.,59,,
737,0.97,5328.723,5336.331,"Thank you, Council President.",60,,
738,0.97,5336.331,5347.742,"Councilmembers, I appreciate the opportunity to weigh in here, and thank you for the invitation to offer some comments, Council President Gonzalez.",60,,
739,0.97,5347.742,5354.148,"Especially in our remote nature, I think this helps add to the understanding of how committee meeting go when we are not able to be there.",60,,
740,0.97,5354.148,5355.616,Maybe one part of a committee meeting.,60,,
741,0.97,5355.616,5364.258,I'll just offer my comments that I made at the last committee meeting in alignment with the chair's position.,60,,
742,0.97,5364.258,5375.136,"I think that number one, the amendments that Councilmember Pedersen announced, Councilmember Herbold had discussed, are Well- intentioned.",60,,
743,0.97,5375.136,5378.072,I think there are differences between the Mha program and what we are talking about here.,60,,
744,0.97,5378.072,5390.518,"Especially because of the type of housing that is currently being claimed, or under the existing model, there's a number of concerns about whether or not certain projects would be able to move forward with that kind of Timeframe.",60,,
745,0.97,5390.518,5403.064,We also know that there is the extension opportunity that the chair has noted in the past that make it very likely that extension will be offered.,60,,
746,0.97,5403.064,5414.175,Just overall I think the biggest driving forces we've heard from a number of religious institutions that it would create a hardship for them to create the affordable housing that we so desperately need on those properties in the very near future.,60,,
747,0.97,5414.175,5423.584,"In alignment with what the church Council of greater Seattle said, in opposition to the amendments, I will be opposing.",60,,
748,0.97,5423.584,5433.795,I just wanted to offer that background for those who weren't part of the committee meeting last week.,60,,
749,0.97,5433.795,5437.732,Councilmember Strauss?,61,,
750,0.97,5437.732,5441.235,"Thank you, Council President.",62,,
751,0.97,5441.235,5445.139,I will just highlight that I am again open to the consideration of these amendments.,62,,
752,0.97,5445.139,5447.942,Now is not the right time.,62,,
753,0.97,5447.942,5475.536,"We received the position of opposition from the church Council of greater Seattle who is the entity that would be utilizing this bill . If the entity, and the entities that are represented with the church Council of greater Seattle, are not welcoming these changes and would make it harder for them to utilize this bill, then I ask why are we passing these amendments at these times?",62,,
754,0.97,5475.536,5477.171,Okay.,63,,
755,0.97,5477.171,5486.647,I think--I think I--I don't see any other hands raised.,63,,
756,0.97,5486.647,5491.986,I'm not sure if Councilmember Herbold wants to add anything else but I think we are ready to move along.,63,,
757,0.97,5491.986,5494.689,"So, I'm going to hand it back over to Councilmember Herbold.",63,,
758,0.97,5494.689,5495.857,"Sure, I will move along.",64,,
759,0.97,5495.857,5517.578,"[Laughter] I do want to just say hearing from, and advocacy group that will use the regulatory capacity to develop affordable housing that they would like a lower obligation to have to fulfill, is not unusual.",64,,
760,0.97,5517.578,5525.386,"So, I think we really, in this case, we've heard from the church Council.",64,,
761,0.97,5525.386,5550.311,"In other cases, when we have been discussing legislation that impacts by giving greater development capacity to a private developer and having the discussion about what our expectations are of that developer to provide for affordable housing, we've also heard from those developers that they would like a lower obligation.",64,,
762,0.97,5550.311,5568.129,"What I'm concerned about is, I understand that many of these projects will very likely be projects where the partner of the religious institution will be a nonprofit housing developer.",64,,
763,0.97,5568.129,5589.617,"I don't want to create a situation where we are actually Incentivizing the development of higher income Affordabe housing by making it more likely that the religious facility--that religious institution partners with a for profit developer, rather than one of our low income housing property developers.",64,,
764,0.97,5589.617,5595.423,Who would be building that 60% AMI housing and for a longer Affordability term.,64,,
765,0.97,5595.423,5627.788,"I'm happy to talk, Councilmember Strauss, about ways to ensure that projects that are sort of already in a development phase are not negatively impacted by an amendment like this, but I appreciate your openness to maybe structuring this in a way that addresses the concerns about creating the incentive for higher income affordable housing in the future.",64,,
766,0.97,5627.788,5638.332,"So, moving on to go items that I have from my Committee, from the public safety and human services Committee on the full council agenda today.",64,,
767,0.97,5638.332,5639.734,I have just one item.,64,,
768,0.97,5639.734,5648.843,That is the appointment of court administrator of the Seattle municipal court.,64,,
769,0.97,5648.843,5657.852,We have heard her confirmation in committee and her confirmation was presented by presiding judge Gregory.,64,,
770,0.97,5657.852,5668.162,She comes highly recommended by the hiring panel that conducted those interviews.,64,,
