68,0.97,441.808,450.416,This property has the capacity to serve the large number of people who are experiencing homelessness in the North end for short and long term.,20,,
69,0.97,450.416,456.622,Sam's Club would follow a similar model as the Tesla dealership in Soto which is leased from the private owner.,20,,

106,0.97,641.774,656.555,"Unfortunately, as currently drafted, this bill requires extensive and Dupe La Kaitive exposures to independent contractors and this results in cumbersome processes where paragraphs of content are being displayed over and over again as drivers attempt to work on the platforms.",32,,
107,0.97,656.555,662.928,So we believe there are ways to Concisely disclose critical information without the risk of it getting lost in paragraphs.,32,,

120,0.97,712.845,718.15,Everyday we hear from workers who depend on that flexibility of gig work.,34,,
121,0.97,718.15,723.456,We see chip away at that flexibility by penalizing them for rejecting low paying offers.,34,,
122,0.97,723.456,728.227,I hear from workers who have been deactivated for no reason and getting no response when they contact support.,34,,
123,0.97,728.227,736.535,I have heard from workers who have also become homeless because of their car breaking down and they haven't been able to put away money while working up to 50 hours a week.,34,,
124,0.97,736.535,748.848,That's why we're happy to hear that the Council is including a commitment in the contractor transfer ordinance--[inaudible] and more robust transparency qualities for gig workers this year.,34,,
125,0.97,748.848,763.629,"We are here today to ask you to move this legislation forward as first steps toward ending Subminimum wages for gig workers who are predominantly people of color, immigrants, Lggt workers.",34,,
126,0.97,763.629,766.198,I want to underscore portable benefits for domestic workers.,34,,

136,0.97,793.793,800.599,I also want to talk about creating protections for pay and flexibility for gig workers.,38,,
137,0.97,800.599,805.905,So most gig workers choose to be gig workers because they have other responsibilities in their lives that require it.,38,,
138,0.97,805.905,821.086,"For me I have family Responsibilityies, and basically we can't have true flexibility if we're being paid so little that we have to work the same number of hours to live comfortably.",38,,
139,0.97,821.086,827.426,So I need to be able to take time off of work to visit my mother and be in my nephews' lives.,38,,
140,0.97,827.426,829.028,And that's all I really have to say.,38,,

149,0.97,849.982,851.15,"Thank you, Council members.",42,,
150,0.97,851.15,852.284,My name is Joe Thompson.,42,,
151,0.97,852.284,855.521,I am the President of mercy housing Northwest.,42,,
152,0.97,855.521,869.235,I'm asking you to please consider a $2.5 million allocation of the recovery act funds to support resident services for the city's Non- permanent supportive housing affordable housing communities.,42,,
153,0.97,869.235,883.582,I feel funding at this level and not less is critical to ensure that our services are robust enough to meet the challenges brought on by Covid- 19 that our residents face and will continue to face for the foreseeable future.,42,,
154,0.97,883.582,891.49,Mercy housing Northwest has a longstanding commitment of performing Onsite services to all of our properties and all of our residents.,42,,
155,0.97,891.49,894.46,To this point we have received no funding from the city of Seattle.,42,,
156,0.97,894.46,900.232,"We'd very much like to expand the depths of our service, Academy this funding would allow us to do this.",42,,
157,0.97,900.232,909.541,Thank you very much for considering allocating our funds to support resident services at Nonpermit-Supported housing in the community.,42,,
158,0.97,909.541,910.109,Thank you very much.,43,,
159,0.97,910.109,915.714,The next three speakers are Dr.,43,,
160,0.97,915.714,923.055,"Alexander Garavees, Justin Simmons and Alika Dmeng Ez.",43,,
161,0.97,923.055,923.889,"Good morning, doctor.",43,,
162,0.97,923.889,926.725,"Good morning, Council members.",44,,
163,0.97,926.725,931.13,My name is Dr. Alex Andra Gerves.,44,,
164,0.97,931.13,934.166,I'm talking about a support mandate for workers.,44,,
165,0.97,934.166,937.303,I wrote my Doctoral thesis on portable benefits.,44,,
166,0.97,937.303,944.276,"And after spending the last three years studying, I find that there's interest at the Federal, state and municipal level.",44,,
167,0.97,944.276,946.912,Philadelphia is the only city to successfully pass a mandate.,44,,
168,0.97,946.912,954.42,"Seattle could lead the way in demonstrating that a mandate is possible and could serve as inspiration, along with San Francisco in driving policy across the country.",44,,
169,0.97,954.42,964.029,"I also believe the power of a portable benefits mandate goes beyond the benefits themselves, benefits in this case become Legiblity tools.",44,,
170,0.97,964.029,966.665,They make work visual and Quantifiable.,44,,
171,0.97,966.665,971.87,Providing a benefit structure helps Legitimize standard work that is deserving of work protections.,44,,
172,0.97,971.87,983.382,"And finally, in my research, I have found that access to benefits without a mandate and a way to accrue hours equitably will not result in domestic workers getting protection.",44,,
173,0.97,983.382,984.917,That's the why the recommendation is crucial.,44,,
174,0.97,984.917,985.384,Thank you very much.,44,,
175,0.97,985.384,986.819,Thank you very much.,45,,

252,0.97,1623.388,1628.86,"During Covid, workers have had an increased need for Pto.",62,,
253,0.97,1628.86,1635.634,"The alia platform have shown that Pto works if enough employers participate, but not enough employers do.",62,,
254,0.97,1635.634,1642.974,So alia shows that we need Council to enact portable Pto as a mandate for employers to participate.,62,,
255,0.97,1642.974,1651.416,"Lastly, we have surveyed employers, and nearly 60% of them say employers should be responsible for paying domestic worker benefits, including Pto.",62,,
256,0.97,1651.416,1652.817,So workers need it.,62,,
257,0.97,1652.817,1654.452,"It's doable, and employers support it.",62,,
258,0.97,1654.452,1662.093,We urge you to follow the standard board's recommendation and approve portable Pto for domestic workers as a permanent mandated policy.,62,,

274,0.97,1914.212,1924.455,"I spoke to them about a program called alia to help provide benefits to me, and they said that since it was not mandatory, they did not participate.",65,,
275,0.97,1924.455,1935.6,"I have realized that immigrants, people of color are--many other people--most of the people that don't have any kind of benefits or supported at work, and a lot of it has to do with lack of knowledge.",65,,

356,0.97,2589.753,2601.932,The arts and cultural sector are uniquely positioned to unite and help bring feelings of safety and solace back to our city's residents during the crucial Covid recovery period.,80,,
357,0.97,2601.932,2607.705,More than 62% of artistic and creative workers have been unemployed.,80,,
358,0.97,2607.705,2620.617,"95% of them have experienced significant loss of income, and 71% of arts organizations indicate that the financial impact has been severe due to the pandemic.",80,,
359,0.97,2620.617,2636.367,"[inaudible] you all consider investing in individual arts by allocating $15 million to serve as a stimulus towards working creative in Seattle, of course invest seed money of $1 million and invest in our cultural communities.",80,,

366,0.97,2669.933,2672.703,My name is Kim England.,82,,
367,0.97,2672.703,2678.208,I support the domestic worker standards board's recommendations.,82,,

369,0.97,2679.61,2684.548,I speak today as a proud member of the coalition of domestic workers and their allies.,82,,
370,0.97,2684.548,2691.889,Earlier this year the coalition conducted a survey of employers of domestic workers.,82,,
371,0.97,2691.889,2694.158,Over 120 employers responded.,82,,
372,0.97,2694.158,2697.394,I will highlight just a few of the findings.,82,,
373,0.97,2697.394,2704.268,A little over 70% of employers said domestic workers should receive paid vacation time.,82,,
374,0.97,2704.268,2715.512,"Approximately 90% of employers say domestic workers should receive paid sick time, and about 90% of employers responded that domestic workers should get health insurance.",82,,
375,0.97,2715.512,2728.425,"And as you already heard from Marcos Martinez, nearly 60% of employers included the hiring family among the list of who should pay for domestic work benefits.",82,,
376,0.97,2728.425,2735.599,One of our conversations also show that many of our employees are supported but confused about benefits for domestic workers.,82,,
377,0.97,2735.599,2745.909,Employers tell us they are keen to get clearer ground rules from city leadership and that they are eager for a platform of Recordkeeping compliance that is simple to use.,82,,

385,0.97,2773.971,2784.882,"We support the passing of policies which increase transparency for independent contractors and commit to the next step, a pay standard for gig workers in 2021.",85,,
386,0.97,2784.882,2793.423,"We were already making Subminimum wages, but during Covid, when the gig companies are making billions more, they dropped our pay even further.",85,,
387,0.97,2793.423,2795.793,It's now lower than ever.,85,,
388,0.97,2795.793,2808.005,"And the discrepancy has become so vast, people are bleeding money, unable to pay their bills, that's seriously hurting tens of thousands of workers, your neighbors and our local economy.",85,,
389,0.97,2808.005,2818.081,"Without the long overdue Pay-Up standards in place, the race to the bottom in the gig economy will only pick up speed, leaving more vulnerable and marginalized workers behind.",85,,
390,0.97,2818.081,2821.885,We need the Council to pass the Pay-Up policy for gig workers this year.,85,,

402,0.97,2871.668,2874.738,Child care workers have been historically underpaid.,87,,
403,0.97,2874.738,2894.358,"King County child care workers now make about $16 an hour, but child care workers have also stepped up as essential workers, and as this Council has deemed that grocery store workers are essential workers and deserve a $4 an hour wage increase, we are proposing that child care workers get a $2 an hour wage increase.",87,,
404,0.97,2894.358,2898.629,That would bring their pay up to about $18.50 an hour.,87,,
405,0.97,2898.629,2903.7,That will cost about $6 million for calendar year 2021.,87,,

423,0.97,3056.086,3057.888,Since we work such few hours.,91,,
424,0.97,3057.888,3070.267,"Because we don't have access to these benefits, many of my colleagues have continued working during the pandemic for fear of losing their work, even with the risk of being infected with Covid-19.",91,,
425,0.97,3070.267,3073.737,I feel powerless that I am not able to help my colleagues.,91,,

436,0.97,3124.387,3129.993,I'm speaking today to urge the Council to implement a portable benefits system for domestic workers.,93,,
437,0.97,3129.993,3133.964,My son was born with a severe neuromuscular disease.,93,,
438,0.97,3133.964,3139.803,"He has a Traik os at that MI, he has a chair and requires constant care.",93,,

441,0.97,3148.445,3156.253,"My partner and I do our best to provide a safe and comfortable work environment, but it still means constantly navigating someone else's personal space.",93,,
442,0.97,3156.253,3159.222,"Meanwhile, most domestic workers did not receive benefits.",93,,
443,0.97,3159.222,3166.563,"The nurses who work in our home are paid through a private agency, yet we still feel a responsibility to ensure they have fair compensation and benefits.",93,,
444,0.97,3166.563,3173.637,"For the woman who comes to clean our home, we know that benefits are not part of her work which means having many different families as employers.",93,,
445,0.97,3173.637,3181.011,That's why we worked with the organization hand in hand a few years ago to set up an account with the alia platform in order to help her with benefits.,93,,
446,0.97,3181.011,3193.723,"In order to effectively pay paid benefits like the time off, we need clear guidance from the city about what platforms to use those benefits.",93,,

460,0.97,3343.039,3352.015,I'm a member of Casa La Tina and was an advocate for the bill of rights for domestic workers in the first year when it came into effect in July of 2019.,96,,
461,0.97,3352.015,3361.825,We were just Assimilating that we had had some basic labor rights when the pandemic hit us and forced us to see the need for paid sick benefits.,96,,
462,0.97,3361.825,3368.898,"Due to the Covid-19, I left my job without and now I have no income or any kind of benefits.",96,,
463,0.97,3368.898,3376.539,"If domestic workers were entitled to sick days or paid time off, at least the stress of not having income would be less.",96,,
464,0.97,3376.539,3386.95,I'm a member of a portable member benefits called alia in which some clients signed up to contribute every time I went to work.,96,,

467,0.97,3394.357,3396.459,There are several models of portable benefits that work.,96,,
468,0.97,3396.459,3407.804,That is why I ask that the Council support the recommendation around a portable benefits platform that is mandatory for domestic workers here in Seattle.,96,,

479,0.97,3528.892,3533.162,I also realized how important portable benefits are to domestic workers.,98,,
480,0.97,3533.162,3541.337,"We work for a different employer, so it's difficult to have benefits such as paid time off, sick time, unemployment or health insurance.",98,,
481,0.97,3541.337,3546.876,Domestic workers are United fighting nonstop to build a society in which we have the rights and respect we deserve.,98,,

501,0.97,3814.377,3821.317,"During the week I work few hours because I clean houses two or three times per week, but I have six employers to mine.",100,,
502,0.97,3821.317,3834.363,"During this pandemic, I was left without a job without any kind of income with a lot of stress and without having the opportunity to receive sick days, benefits because the system is designed only for workers to have only one employer.",100,,

534,0.97,4016.579,4027.823,"But we can't do that if we don't have the stability and the support to be in a healthy place ourselves, and so that is one of the reasons that I am asking for that direct allocation.",106,,
535,0.97,4027.823,4028.424,Thank you.,106,,
536,0.97,4028.424,4028.824,Thank you.,107,,

546,0.97,4076.272,4081.31,I work in services at community housing and we provide affordable housing to over 200 people throughout Seattle.,108,,
547,0.97,4081.31,4087.75,We work to connect residents to Life-Affirming resources but support their housing stability and community connection.,108,,
548,0.97,4087.75,4090.219,Our resident services staff is stretched beyond capacity.,108,,
549,0.97,4090.219,4096.959,Currently we only are able to provide one residence service professional for over 400 residents.,108,,
550,0.97,4096.959,4111.507,"An investment in 2021 will help address the negative economic impacts of the pandemic by helping our neighbors, and especially our low income neighbors in communities of color that are hardest hit, get them connected to economic, social, mental health and educational opportunities.",108,,

558,0.97,4146.742,4152.281,Drive forward does support transparency for Gap-Based gig workers in their work.,111,,
559,0.97,4152.281,4167.263,"But this bill, as usual, is a little convoluted in how it gets there and doesn't really--isn't really practical for how App-Based gig workers do their work on a daily basis and creates complications for them in how it gets to transparency.",111,,
560,0.97,4167.263,4173.435,We would love to be able to work with Council to make this a better bill that all drivers can get behind and all companies can get behind.,111,,
561,0.97,4173.435,4176.605,And I think that's a pretty easy list to do.,111,,
562,0.97,4176.605,4183.479,And so we'd love to work with you in the future to be able to get this bill to be something that everyone can get behind.,111,,
563,0.97,4183.479,4185.714,Transparency isn't an issue that anyone opposes.,111,,
564,0.97,4185.714,4188.751,It's just a matter of getting the legislation correct.,111,,
565,0.97,4188.751,4189.852,Thank you.,111,,

585,0.97,4264.393,4279.074,"Passive arts, for example, provides arts opportunities to low income individuals from over 50 social service partners as a means to recover from trauma, be that trauma from racism, violence, abuse, substance abuse disorder or poverty.",113,,
586,0.97,4279.074,4281.877,It helps artists connect back to themselves in our community.,113,,
587,0.97,4281.877,4287.683,The arts also connect us with each other Tortion see each other through the story and human experience versus statistics.,113,,
588,0.97,4287.683,4295.991,"They are a powerful means to foster empathy and understanding, and an increasingly fracture and divided world.",113,,

712,0.97,5198.593,5207.202,"In our presentation today we will discuss our representations and issues that they seek to resolve, including barriers to outreach, enforcement and implementation.",137,,
713,0.97,5207.202,5218.279,We will also touch on next steps as we expect to work closely with Council and city staff on the implementation and development of these recommendations.,137,,
714,0.97,5219.847,5229.891,Time permitting we will invite other board members and members of the domestic workers' coalition to help with the short discussion that will follow.,137,,
715,0.97,5229.891,5239.634,Next outreach and education has been going in earnest since this went into effect.,137,,
716,0.97,5239.634,5255.45,"We have reached thousands of hiring entities and workers so far, there has only been one investigation out of 15 inquiries.",137,,
717,0.97,5255.45,5263.958,"This is not due to lack of interest or action from the office of labor standards to perform this work, but due to the very real barriers that we will discuss in the next slides.",137,,
718,0.97,5263.958,5265.026,"Next slide, please.",137,,
719,0.97,5265.026,5268.029,So let's talk about the barriers to implementation of this unique ordinance.,137,,
720,0.97,5268.029,5277.171,Domestic workers are unique workforce with no centralized networks.,137,,
721,0.97,5277.171,5278.64,Some workers don't see themselves as domestic workers.,137,,
722,0.97,5278.64,5282.377,Even more homeowners and parents don't see themselves as employers.,137,,
723,0.97,5282.377,5283.911,These individuals may encounter materials about the ordinance.,137,,
724,0.97,5283.911,5290.985,They assume it does not apply to them.,137,,
725,0.97,5290.985,5297.325,"Fear and mistrust is a very real issue for workers both in engaging with city officials, as well as concerns about retaliation from their employers.",137,,
726,0.97,5297.325,5302.397,There is no anonymity when you are making a complaint as the sole employee.,137,,
727,0.97,5302.397,5308.703,Referrals and references are critical to future employment in this Word-Of-Mouth driven industry.,137,,
728,0.97,5308.703,5318.813,"Finally, there are tens of thousands of domestic workers in Seattle in the area and more hiring entities in this region.",137,,
729,0.97,5318.813,5324.118,Reaching all of them in building trust in their communities is a massive task and one that requires consistent and significant support.,137,,
730,0.97,5324.118,5330.324,I will turn it back to Silvia to discuss working conditions.,137,,
731,0.97,5330.324,5718.512,[speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish],138,,

733,0.97,5835.896,5874.368,[speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish],140,,
734,0.97,5874.368,5877.838,There we go.,141,,
735,0.97,5877.838,5885.346,"Thank you, Silvia.",141,,
736,0.97,5885.346,5891.051,New materials and increased materials for outreach are critical to reaching workers and the hiring entities.,141,,
737,0.97,5891.051,5893.988,Language barriers and the privacy of individual home spaces make outreach very difficult.,141,,
738,0.97,5893.988,5909.503,"We need funding to expand mailed materials to every home, a strategy used to reach more employees and workers where they are and provide the materials in languages they are comfortable with.",141,,
739,0.97,5909.503,5914.708,The current funding is not enough at the scale that we need.,141,,
740,0.97,5914.708,5924.718,We also want to highlight the importance of third-party platforms that connect workers and other hiring entities.,141,,
741,0.97,5924.718,5928.389,These platforms are large corporations were disconnected from the daily struggles of those on the ground.,141,,
742,0.97,5928.389,5932.459,Their practices leave many workers vulnerable and hiring entities Ill-Informed.,141,,
743,0.97,5932.459,5944.371,The good news is these companies are covered by the ordinance as hiring entities themselves.,141,,
744,0.97,5944.371,5948.742,Strong city representation insisting these platforms take responsibility for educating their clients and protecting workers can change the industry for the better.,141,,
745,0.97,5948.742,5955.716,"These platforms, when held accountable, can be an incredible resource for changing the culture of this invisible work and improving enforcement methods.",141,,
746,0.97,5955.716,5956.85,"Next slide, please.",141,,
747,0.97,5956.85,5968.929,Access to structured Healthcare is the number one requested benefit by workers based on our local research and that of the National domestic workers alliance.,141,,
748,0.97,5968.929,5984.678,"We ask that the city research ways to provide affordable structured Healthcare to workers, exploring various models and hiring educated entities on their options.",141,,
749,0.97,5984.678,5991.785,Domestic work is taxing on one's body and can result in short-term and long-term injuries.,141,,
750,0.97,5991.785,5997.891,These workers have an especially difficult time obtaining the necessary Healthcare.,141,,
751,0.97,5997.891,6002.363,"They work through injuries because they cannot afford to Miss a shift, let alone go to a doctor.",141,,
752,0.97,6002.363,6004.098,Covid has made this Exponentially more dangerous.,141,,
753,0.97,6004.098,6012.94,Language and technology barriers increase the difficulty of negotiating our current Healthcare systems.,141,,
754,0.97,6012.94,6024.218,Researching ways to improve on these problems and helping to lobby state legislation to expand current offerings to all individuals in Washington will approve improve lives across the board.,141,,
755,0.97,6024.218,6027.888,"Next slide, please.",141,,
756,0.97,6027.888,6036.563,The policy changes that we have outlined in our detailed recommendations are designed to make our ordinance stronger and make outreach easier and clearer.,141,,
757,0.97,6036.563,6051.912,We seek to eliminate any exceptions to the domestic worker ordinance coverage on both sides.,141,,
758,0.97,6051.912,6064.324,"The workers excluded from coverage and no hiring entities excluded from compliance for this adjustment to the ordinance is supported by the relevant local Union representatives, as well as workers.",141,,
759,0.97,6064.324,6068.128,A notice of rights provided by employers and third-party platforms will help ensure that workers understand their rights.,141,,
760,0.97,6068.128,6072.633,"If you don't know what your rights are, it is harder to tell when they are being violated until it is too late.",141,,
761,0.97,6072.633,6085.913,"Regarding the new independent contractor legislation, we ask that the city do its due diligence to make sure all vulnerable workers affected by its legislation be engaged directly to make sure the process helps them in practice and that their concerns are taken into consideration.",141,,
762,0.97,6085.913,6094.988,Úi will pass it back to Silvia to discuss portable benefits.,141,,
763,0.97,6094.988,6097.458,"Silvia, you are on mute.",141,,
764,0.97,6097.458,6414.007,[speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish],142,,
765,0.97,6414.007,6415.509,Good morning.,143,,
766,0.97,6415.509,6426.219,My name is Liz Hunter-Keller and I'm a member of the domestic workers standards board.,143,,
767,0.97,6426.219,6437.631,"More importantly, I am an employer and I am here to voice my support for and if it's and paid leave for domestic workers.",143,,
768,0.97,6437.631,6441.535,"Over the years as a board member, I have heard from domestic workers who have no benefits at all.",143,,
769,0.97,6441.535,6451.444,"That means they go to work sick, which we know over the last year and a half is bad in a number of ways.",143,,
770,0.97,6451.444,6458.285,"They work in close quarters with their colleagues and the families they work for, which means that the possibility of transmission is greatly increased.",143,,
771,0.97,6458.285,6468.528,It also means that the domestic workers may take longer to get well or that something small could turn into something large and dangerous and costly.,143,,
772,0.97,6468.528,6470.764,It is not just sick leave.,143,,
773,0.97,6470.764,6480.874,I have heard from workers who cannot pay to take paid leave to visit a sick family member or attend a funeral.,143,,
774,0.97,6480.874,6493.32,I believe employers would be willing and even happy to pay for benefits for employees.,143,,
775,0.97,6493.32,6496.389,We have results from surveys conducted by community organizations that show employers support paid leave.,143,,
776,0.97,6496.389,6506.7,"I currently use an Online platform to pay my Nanny, which helps me manage my employer taxes, ping to her paid leave, and social security.",143,,
777,0.97,6506.7,6512.606,"There are several of these platforms on the market, which means there is a demand for a domestic worker pay system.",143,,
778,0.97,6512.606,6519.913,It is hard to find a way to pay and to do payment into other domestic worker benefits.,143,,
779,0.97,6519.913,6525.819,That means Pto and benefits are left up to the employers to figure it out.,143,,
780,0.97,6525.819,6536.997,Employees need a way for each household to contribute a fair share of benefits.,143,,
781,0.97,6536.997,6549.943,"If we made paid leave mandatory for domestic workers and supported a portable benefits platforms that allow various households to pay into a central account, the Messick workers could accrue paid time off like the rest of the wage and salary workers in our city.",143,,
782,0.97,6549.943,6557.717,This would make life easier for employers and improve quality of life for domestic workers.,143,,
783,0.97,6557.717,6561.154,Let's make sure domestic workers have the ability to take paid leave like the rest of us.,143,,
784,0.97,6561.154,6565.625,Everyone should be afforded the right to take some time off without financial or physical hardship.,143,,
785,0.97,6565.625,6567.661,"Thank you, Liz.",144,,
786,0.97,6567.661,6569.529,I will turn it back.,145,,
787,0.97,6569.529,6827.42,[speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish],146,,
788,0.97,6827.42,6828.288,"Thank you, Silvia.",147,,
789,0.97,6828.288,6832.559,This is our last slide of the presentation touching on next steps.,147,,
790,0.97,6832.559,6840.5,Continued engagement with Stakeholders and board members throughout this 120 day response period and beyond is of huge importance to the board.,147,,
791,0.97,6840.5,6853.446,We would like Council staff to attend our monthly meetings to provide substantive status updates and apply our suggestions and feedback.,147,,
792,0.97,6853.446,6865.625,"The portable benefits subcommittee and the domestic workers coalition expects regular updates and engagement from Council staff, specifically on portable benefits.",147,,
793,0.97,6865.625,6869.062,A meeting about this recommendation should take place within the first 30 days of this response period.,147,,
794,0.97,6869.062,6872.999,"We expect that workers, immunity experts, and board members are central to guiding the implementation process.",147,,
795,0.97,6872.999,6887.48,Their expertise and such is Prioritized.,147,,
796,0.97,6892.518,6901.794,We need to illustrate the real and hiring entities . C workers we appreciate the trust you have placed in us by reading this board in the first place.,147,,
797,0.97,6901.794,6907.9,Allow us to be hands-on in putting these recommendations into practice.,147,,
798,0.97,6907.9,6911.638,We plan to continue to make recommendations to guide the expansion of domestic workers rights.,147,,
799,0.97,6911.638,6913.806,That includes all of this.,147,,
800,0.97,6913.806,6919.279,That concludes our presentation.,147,,
801,0.97,6919.279,6921.614,Invite members of the coalition and the board to answer questions.,147,,
802,0.97,6921.614,6922.916,"Silvia, would you like to speak?",147,,
803,0.97,6922.916,6962.789,[speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish],148,,
804,0.97,6974.334,6975.535,I will step in here.,149,,
805,0.97,6975.535,6978.771,I want to give folks a chance to understand where we are at in the agenda.,149,,
806,0.97,6978.771,6979.972,This is the first agenda item.,149,,
807,0.97,6979.972,6987.28,"We only have two more agenda items for our revised agenda items allows for 30 minutes, which should be more than necessary to put towards the next agenda item.",149,,
808,0.97,6987.28,6992.385,We will start that at 11:45.,149,,
809,0.97,6992.385,6993.987,We have about 15 minutes of discussion right now.,149,,
810,0.97,6993.987,6998.291,"We will start the last agenda item at 12:15, so we end by our 1:00 time.",149,,
811,0.97,6998.291,6999.926,I see nuts from Councilmembers.,149,,
812,0.97,6999.926,7001.694,Great.,149,,
813,0.97,7001.694,7026.085,"As the last slide says, from the participation of the domestic workers bill of rights drafting and Cosponsorship, thank you Council colleagues, we put in pretty strict language to require a response to the recommendations that were submitted.",149,,
814,0.97,7026.085,7034.227,"We are required to respond by September 15, 2021.",149,,
815,0.97,7034.227,7044.003,That ensures that recommendations do not come forward and just should sit on a shelf.,149,,
816,0.97,7044.003,7047.206,We want to talk about what is possible and what is not possible and alternatives proposed.,149,,
817,0.97,7047.206,7055.748,A reminder on that.,149,,
818,0.97,7055.748,7061.654,"In terms of process, colleagues, we want to make sure there is a transparent and open dialogue, both with members of the board and with members of the public.",149,,
819,0.97,7061.654,7081.974,"We will be asking you to share your questions and thoughts not only in today's presentation, future committee meetings, such as on July 9. we want to be able to have a letter Crafted and discussed at our July 20 or August 3 community meetings.",149,,
820,0.97,7081.974,7085.011,All of this would be a very public discussion about responses to the recommendations.,149,,
821,0.97,7085.011,7090.283,Today is a chance to walk through those four high-level recommendations.,149,,
822,0.97,7090.283,7099.392,We can have some questions and there will be another three committee meetings over July and August we will have a chance to vent and discuss the recommendations even more.,149,,
823,0.97,7099.392,7107.366,I want to make sure you won't know what the process looks like so that we as a collective Council will be drafting our response as required in a series of meetings coming up.,149,,
824,0.97,7107.366,7113.206,"Okay, let's turn it over to questions from I want to thank the translator.",149,,
825,0.97,7113.206,7120.713,"I know that is a ton of work, and we have board members who popped on the screen.",149,,
826,0.97,7120.713,7123.816,It is great to see all of you.,149,,
827,0.97,7123.816,7128.888,"Colleagues, questions?",149,,
828,0.97,7128.888,7131.924,"Okay, I will pop in one question.",149,,
829,0.97,7131.924,7135.595,It is good to see so many faces.,149,,
830,0.97,7135.595,7136.429,"Oh, my gosh.",149,,
831,0.97,7136.429,7144.337,It is like a reunion coming on the screen here.,149,,
832,0.97,7144.337,7147.173,"If this were in person, it would be exciting to see all of you.",149,,
833,0.97,7147.173,7162.822,"For the viewing public, I want to make sure people know that we are talking about people who are currently considered as exempt from this, there is information on the slide labeled number three, which is policy changes to improve.",149,,
834,0.97,7162.822,7168.06,"Just as a quick reminder, this was done in correlation with the domestic workers bill of rights.",149,,
835,0.97,7168.06,7181.073,There was some Concernat the time about having duplicate standards for dedicated Reimbursable long-term care providers.,149,,
836,0.97,7181.073,7182.875,It sounds like the conversation has changed around it.,149,,
837,0.97,7182.875,7184.343,That is part of the recommendation.,149,,
838,0.97,7184.343,7189.181,I want to make sure folks know why they were originally excluded and the evolution of the thought around that.,149,,
839,0.97,7189.181,7196.355,"People might wonder, why were they excluded in the first place?",149,,
840,0.97,7196.355,7198.19,There were some lessons learned in the last few years.,149,,
841,0.97,7198.19,7201.16,Now the recommendation is to include some of those Medicaid Reimbursable workers.,149,,
842,0.97,7201.16,7204.664,Additional questions?,149,,
843,0.97,7204.664,7205.064,Okay.,149,,
844,0.97,7205.064,7206.799,We do have a few more minutes.,149,,
845,0.97,7206.799,7214.006,Are there any additional comments that the board members wish to Chime in on?,149,,
846,0.97,7214.006,7219.011,Is there any additional context that you would like to provide?,149,,
847,0.97,7219.011,7220.212,Okay.,149,,
848,0.97,7220.212,7231.891,There has been an incredible amount of work to try to engage domestic workers.,150,,
849,0.97,7231.891,7236.529,We are desperately trying to get more workers at the table.,150,,
850,0.97,7236.529,7247.907,"I am really proud to say that, as I transition off of this board, that my role has been replaced with a worker.",150,,
851,0.97,7247.907,7253.012,But we have intentionally tried to reach out and to engage in to be thoughtful.,150,,
852,0.97,7253.012,7259.385,We have appreciated your leadership and we appreciate the directive written in the ordinance.,150,,
853,0.97,7259.385,7261.854,"We are asking you to do lots of big, different things.",150,,
854,0.97,7261.854,7268.227,We don't want you to be overwhelmed by the ask.,150,,
855,0.97,7268.227,7270.663,We are here in solidarity with you to do the hard work.,150,,
856,0.97,7270.663,7273.866,Thank you so very much.,150,,
857,0.97,7273.866,7278.27,"Councilmember Gonzalez, my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.",150,,
858,0.97,7278.27,7285.878,"I want to take this opportunity to say thank you for your service on the board, as well.",151,,
859,0.97,7285.878,7292.385,We recently voted to appoint your replacement.,151,,
860,0.97,7292.385,7294.854,We appreciate you helping us to get this entity off the ground.,151,,
861,0.97,7294.854,7296.689,We know you will be involved in various ways.,151,,
862,0.97,7296.689,7296.956,Yes?,151,,
863,0.97,7296.956,7300.092,"Good morning, everybody.",152,,
864,0.97,7300.092,7305.765,I am in the coalition of domestic workers.,152,,
865,0.97,7305.765,7331.19,"I just wanted to reiterate that, especially speaking about portable benefits, as you have heard over public comments over domestic workers and what we have seen through the pandemic, it is very highly needed to have support, to have protection, especially paid time off.",152,,
866,0.97,7331.19,7341.1,"I wanted to reiterate that it is something, the portable benefit request, it is there and it is sorely needed.",152,,
867,0.97,7341.1,7343.602,It is so needed.,152,,
868,0.97,7343.602,7344.937,And it is possible.,152,,
869,0.97,7344.937,7346.439,We have seen it.,152,,
870,0.97,7346.439,7353.913,I want to give a little bit of information about Aaliyah for those who are not knowledgeable there.,152,,
871,0.97,7353.913,7361.821,That is a platform that is gathering workers and employers to pay into the account of workers.,152,,
872,0.97,7361.821,7368.16,It was designed and created by the National domestic workers alliance lab.,152,,
873,0.97,7368.16,7373.466,It has been in existence for at least the last two or three years.,152,,
874,0.97,7373.466,7378.938,We have seen this from the National domestic workers alliance here.,152,,
875,0.97,7378.938,7386.979,"The reason there are different mechanisms in existence, but this worked in terms of visibility.",152,,
876,0.97,7386.979,7392.351,We had about 80 or more domestic workers who use it.,152,,
877,0.97,7392.351,7397.79,"However, only half of the employers opted in.",152,,
878,0.97,7397.79,7400.459,"If it is just an option, it does not work.",152,,
879,0.97,7400.459,7406.699,"Aaliyah would be that mechanism, but it needs to be mandated.",152,,
880,0.97,7406.699,7417.309,That is why it is very important to have a mandated the policy on that so it is not an option for the employers to say yes or no.,152,,
881,0.97,7417.309,7423.215,We have seen that a lot of employers are willing to pay for it.,152,,
882,0.97,7423.215,7429.922,"87% say we should be paid, we are willing to pay portable benefit.",152,,
883,0.97,7429.922,7433.592,They have seen it through the pandemic.,152,,
884,0.97,7433.592,7439.431,They rely on all those domestic workers who are doing the work that is needed for all the other workers to go out and work.,152,,
885,0.97,7439.431,7449.008,"As we are coming back to hopefully some kind of normalcy, that will be even more and more needed.",152,,
886,0.97,7449.008,7451.811,We should not forget what domestic workers went through through the pandemic.,152,,
887,0.97,7451.811,7455.347,It was so visible that now we can and should do something.,152,,
888,0.97,7455.347,7464.056,"In Seattle, the city Council has been always at the forefront of the new legislation, the minimum wage and all of that.",152,,
889,0.97,7464.056,7469.662,We want to be part of that group in the front.,152,,
890,0.97,7469.662,7473.365,We have other cities that are working on that.,152,,
891,0.97,7473.365,7475.167,That is something we can learn from.,152,,
892,0.97,7475.167,7478.671,We have the Adelphia.,152,,
893,0.97,7478.671,7479.271,We have San Francisco.,152,,
894,0.97,7479.271,7489.348,"We can learn from them and work on behalf of the benefit of all domestic workers, not just in Seattle, but in Washington and the whole nation.",152,,
895,0.97,7489.348,7494.286,Thank you for listening to all of these domestic workers.,152,,
896,0.97,7494.286,7498.29,"Let's do this together, especially with the workers.",152,,
897,0.97,7498.29,7500.593,Thank you.,152,,
898,0.97,7500.593,7508.501,I did have a question as it relates to the platform.,153,,
899,0.97,7508.501,7509.368,I really appreciate the time.,153,,
900,0.97,7509.368,7517.076,I think it was 2019 that I had a chance to go to New York to meet with fork at the domestic workers alliance.,153,,
901,0.97,7517.076,7520.112,It has been around for a while.,153,,
902,0.97,7520.112,7522.915,I know it has been a helpful tool for many domestic workers.,153,,
903,0.97,7522.915,7525.117,"In Philadelphia, they mandated portable benefits.",153,,
904,0.97,7525.117,7531.423,Are they using an alia platform?,153,,
905,0.97,7531.423,7536.328,What vehicle did they used to get those benefits out to folks?,153,,
906,0.97,7536.328,7543.035,I am with the National domestic workers alliance.,154,,
907,0.97,7543.035,7546.705,I will try to answer your question.,154,,
908,0.97,7546.705,7551.61,The ordinance in Philadelphia has been passed.,154,,
909,0.97,7551.61,7554.246,We are in the regulatory phase of it.,154,,
910,0.97,7554.246,7563.355,The platform itself is being designed by the engineers and the and Dwa LABS.,154,,
911,0.97,7563.355,7570.262,"Alia, as you may have learned and was raised by others is the current system.",154,,
912,0.97,7570.262,7579.371,Will will be unfolded in Philadelphia and hopefully San Francisco is going to be something different.,154,,
913,0.97,7579.371,7592.384,Is going to be based on the ordinance and the specific rule pertaining to how you accrue hours.,154,,
914,0.97,7592.384,7593.786,It will be a different application.,154,,
915,0.97,7593.786,7617.876,But the concepts that originated from the alia pilot that you are familiar with is the spirit of what will be folded out in Philadelphia and hopefully in San Francisco.,154,,
916,0.97,7621.947,7628.587,Do you know when the Philly and San Francisco platforms will be available for hiring entities and domestic workers?,155,,
917,0.97,7628.587,7638.13,"The second part of that question, I sought our friend, Jasmine, on the line here.",155,,
918,0.97,7638.13,7644.636,"As part of the ordinance, we had requested a draft contract or a model contract that could be used.",155,,
919,0.97,7644.636,7657.85,Does this contract go beyond explaining the rights to a guaranteed amount of pay?,155,,
920,0.97,7657.85,7672.264,"Visit talk about how they can accrue or earn paid time off or sick leave as part of that model contract if a hiring entity at this point chooses to do so, recognizing they should be, since we put it into law.",155,,
921,0.97,7672.264,7683.642,"It is part of the required Pto--I am sorry, paid breaks or at least part of the contract that we envisioned.",155,,
922,0.97,7683.642,7686.178,Do we envision Pto being listed in the draft contract?,155,,
923,0.97,7686.178,7693.185,My name is Jasmine Marwaha and I'm with the office of labor standards.,156,,
924,0.97,7693.185,7704.363,"The domestic workers ordinance right now says people should make available a model notice of rights, which is slightly different than a notice of contract.",156,,
925,0.97,7704.363,7715.441,The notice of rights that we have provided as a sample just lists the resident titles that domestic workers are entitled to from the domestic workers ordinance.,156,,
926,0.97,7715.441,7719.211,It does not make reference to the option of portable benefits.,156,,
927,0.97,7719.211,7720.979,That is right.,157,,
928,0.97,7720.979,7721.613,I forgot that.,157,,
929,0.97,7721.613,7727.686,He also had the domestic workers standards board come up with potential model contract language.,157,,
930,0.97,7727.686,7730.322,Is that right?,157,,
931,0.97,7730.322,7740.899,That was a possible topic of discussion that was listed in the ordinance.,158,,
932,0.97,7740.899,7742.734,That was not necessarily a directive to the board.,158,,
933,0.97,7742.734,7746.405,I do know that some community partners that are funded by Ols do have some model contracts.,158,,
934,0.97,7746.405,7751.844,I know the National domestic workers alliance also has model contracts available.,158,,
935,0.97,7751.844,7760.152,"Those resources do exist, but they are not necessarily from Ols.",158,,
936,0.97,7760.152,7769.962,I just wanted to clarify that the ordinance Philadelphia mandates written agreements.,159,,
937,0.97,7769.962,7782.141,"Notice of rights . with the once the portable benefits system is rolled out, and to answer your question, we expected to be rolled out by the end of the year.",159,,
938,0.97,7782.141,7783.542,"San Francisco, it is not law you.",159,,
939,0.97,7783.542,7786.678,We will introduce the ordinance in mid-June or the end of June.,159,,
940,0.97,7786.678,7796.355,"There is not yet an ordinance in San Francisco, but we are getting close to a proposal that will be Vetted by the board of supervisors.",159,,
941,0.97,7796.355,7796.788,Wonderful.,160,,
942,0.97,7796.788,7801.793,I see Baylie?,160,,
943,0.97,7801.793,7817.075,"Correct me if I am wrong, fellow colleagues, but we needed more discussion and more time to engage more workers to make sure it was something that actually worked for them and did not create barriers to that situation.",161,,
944,0.97,7817.075,7827.019,Contracts and formal agreements can induce fear and emotional barriers to that situation.,161,,
945,0.97,7827.019,7835.527,We kind of determined overtime that needed more discussion and worker engagement to see if that was going to move forward.,161,,
946,0.97,7835.527,7837.596,Thank you for that update.,162,,
947,0.97,7837.596,7841.233,"Councilmember Herbold, did you have something?",162,,
948,0.97,7841.233,7852.845,Just a question for Jasmine on what the current funding is that is available for outreach and if it is broken out by type of outreach.,163,,
949,0.97,7852.845,7862.721,"My notes say that, so far, Ols has received 15 worker inquiries resulting in one investigation.",163,,
950,0.97,7862.721,7900.158,Our these outcomes associated with the current laws? is this part of the call for more outreach resources that the domestic workers board would take on? I want to understand more about the thinking . I see 15 worker inquiries and one investigation.,163,,
951,0.97,7900.158,7914.206,"If those numbers are correct, then that would lead me to believe, not that I want to believe that there are a lot of violations in the community, that it would lead me to believe that more information about workers rights is important.",163,,
952,0.97,7914.206,7926.918,I am just trying to see whether or not we are considering those Metrics as part of the argument for why we need more resources.,163,,
953,0.97,7926.918,7932.624,"Again, I just want to understand what the current budget is for outreach.",163,,
954,0.97,7932.624,7935.494,I can speak a little bit to the current budget.,164,,
955,0.97,7935.494,7944.836,Then I will let the board advocate . We have not taken a formal position on the recommendations it.,164,,
956,0.97,7944.836,7949.574,We can also circle back and have something in writing in terms of the breakdown of the outreach budget.,164,,
957,0.97,7949.574,7958.55,"Currently, we have a current outreach and education Fund and a business outreach and education Fund.",164,,
958,0.97,7958.55,7966.758,The dw Oh is among the list of labor standards that community organizations do outreach for.,164,,
959,0.97,7966.758,7973.065,"It is folded into, not necessarily specific to the ordinance.",164,,
960,0.97,7973.065,7976.134,It is folded into our suite of 16 labor standards.,164,,
961,0.97,7976.134,7997.155,"And then there is also about 35,000 that Ols receives that is for, both for Dwo outreach, but also for costs, including costs of interpretation and translation and other administrative costs.",164,,
962,0.97,7997.155,8003.662,"I don't have a breakdown of how much of that $35,000 goes to outreach versus board administration.",164,,
963,0.97,8003.662,8005.997,But that is the pot.,164,,
964,0.97,8005.997,8014.072,"Council allocated an additional one-time funding of $50,000 to Jumpstart the implementation of the recommendations.",164,,
965,0.97,8014.072,8030.322,"Part of the, part of our response and evaluation over the next couple of weeks and months is going to be, in collaboration with the board, what can be done with that $50,000?",164,,
966,0.97,8030.322,8037.462,What will need additional resources? we want to do a Prioritization exercise with them.,164,,
967,0.97,8037.462,8043.335,Any closing comments in response to the question or overall?,165,,
968,0.97,8043.335,8050.709,My daughters and Emily both have their hands up.,166,,
969,0.97,8050.709,8052.043,Thank you.,167,,
970,0.97,8052.043,8059.618,I just wanted to quickly comment that it is a little bit on the contract side.,167,,
971,0.97,8059.618,8068.86,"As Baylie mentioned, there is a fear from many workers on creating a contract that they may not feel comfortable with.",167,,
972,0.97,8068.86,8081.339,"But I think a great vehicle to make sure this happens is through, through the notice of rights.",167,,
973,0.97,8081.339,8091.95,"I think it would be a great idea, as Council number Mosqueda to mentioned, possibly the accrual system for workers in that notice of rights.",167,,
974,0.97,8091.95,8105.864,The only issue that I see in many other workers is that it is not mandatory to offer to the employers.,167,,
975,0.97,8105.864,8121.78,"I think that would be a great push forward, this work that we are already doing, to be able to enforce the law that we already have and push for more people to really follow the law.",167,,
976,0.97,8121.78,8125.217,"Unfortunately, a lot of workers feel intimidated when talking to employers.",167,,
977,0.97,8125.217,8134.126,A lot of workers don't have the capacity or confidence to talk about their rights.,167,,
978,0.97,8134.126,8140.232,It is a matter of the relationship that they have to develop with them.,167,,
979,0.97,8140.232,8145.737,They have to learn to be employers.,167,,
980,0.97,8145.737,8163.622,"I think one great opportunity for us is through the already created notice of rights, making it mandatory and starting from that so we can keep enforcing this the way it was meant to be from the get go.",167,,
981,0.97,8163.622,8166.858,I appreciate you for what you are doing today.,167,,
982,0.97,8166.858,8170.061,I decided to speak in English to make my points.,167,,
983,0.97,8170.061,8181.473,But I really appreciate the time and capacity that you are Úputting into making this available for our workers.,167,,
984,0.97,8181.473,8183.475,I appreciate that a lot.,167,,
985,0.97,8183.475,8185.043,I hope you can continue doing this.,167,,
986,0.97,8185.043,8185.81,Thank you.,167,,
987,0.97,8185.81,8188.38,Thank you.,168,,
988,0.97,8188.38,8190.382,And Emily to close us out.,168,,
989,0.97,8190.382,8196.087,I want to think everybody here.,169,,
990,0.97,8196.087,8198.356,I want to thank you for the work you are doing.,169,,
991,0.97,8198.356,8203.595,I will be quick about advocating resources.,169,,
992,0.97,8203.595,8208.7,"Just shout a little, Emily.",170,,
993,0.97,8208.7,8216.608,"Just really investing in bringing people to the table, the workers, is what I have a concern about.",171,,
994,0.97,8216.608,8225.183,"I wanted to point out that the passed two years of our board service, that three of people who left were workers voices.",171,,
995,0.97,8225.183,8233.558,"I believe not speaking to their personal situations, but I believe those are the reasons that the employer representation left.",171,,
996,0.97,8233.558,8241.399,Was more that they had to make the decision between going to the board meetings or going to work.,171,,
997,0.97,8241.399,8249.641,I think that we really need to make an effort to find a way to bring those people to the table for more affordable representation.,171,,
998,0.97,8249.641,8250.909,Thank you.,171,,
999,0.97,8250.909,8253.812,Thank you.,172,,

1002,0.97,8264.356,8269.861,We are working on design and unfolding the platform.,173,,
1003,0.97,8269.861,8270.662,It is a permanent mandate.,173,,
1004,0.97,8270.662,8273.999,The San Francisco bill that I am working on would also be permanent.,173,,
1005,0.97,8273.999,8279.371,The board of supervisors has unanimously shown support of it.,173,,
1006,0.97,8279.371,8280.372,Excellent.,174,,

1008,0.97,8285.477,8290.749,"Dana, did you have one more thing?",174,,
1009,0.97,8290.749,8313.705,"I would love the time to respond, I know I cannot do it now, but about the question about outreach and why it has been so difficult, especially in terms of outreach to employers for as a staff person for Hand-In-Hand in Seattle who was very much responsible for doing a lot of that outreach, I would love to talk about why we do need that outreach money.",175,,
1010,0.97,8313.705,8316.574,That would be very welcome.,176,,
1011,0.97,8316.574,8319.911,"If there are any additional contracts you want to provide, wonderful.",176,,
1012,0.97,8319.911,8322.814,We will take letters.,176,,
1013,0.97,8322.814,8326.117,We will take examples as we consider our response here.,176,,
1014,0.97,8326.117,8350.842,"Just to clarify for members of the public, while the notice of rights might not have a mandatory Pto and sick leave, it was the topic of discussion today, I want to remind folks that it is mandatory that domestic workers get rest and meal breaks according to the law and at least the minimum wage, which is also mandatory.",176,,
1015,0.97,8350.842,8353.278,And a lot more conversations to come.,176,,
1016,0.97,8353.278,8357.148,"Baylie, last comment?",176,,
1017,0.97,8357.148,8370.161,I want to get a commitment from Councilmembers in this room right now to engage with us on a monthly basis going forward for this 120 day period.,177,,
1018,0.97,8370.161,8371.83,I know it will be a busy time.,177,,
1019,0.97,8371.83,8379.337,We want to make sure that the response is not 119 days to the end of the period.,177,,
1020,0.97,8379.337,8390.482,Can I get a commitment from Councilmembers and staff here to continue to engage with us on a monthly basis for the rest of this response period?,177,,
1021,0.97,8390.482,8392.016,I think you saw some Thumbs- up.,178,,
1022,0.97,8392.016,8393.618,I don't think anybody is shy about engaging.,178,,
1023,0.97,8393.618,8395.787,"There will be three more committee meetings on this, as well.",178,,
1024,0.97,8395.787,8396.187,Wonderful.,178,,
1025,0.97,8396.187,8396.988,We will close this out.,178,,
1026,0.97,8396.988,8400.859,I want to thank all of you.,178,,
1027,0.97,8400.859,8402.527,Thank you so much for your time today.,178,,

1030,0.97,8406.498,8407.398,Thank you.,179,,
1031,0.97,8407.398,8415.94,"Item number two, the American rescue plan act direct aid for briefing and discussion.",180,,
1032,0.97,8415.94,8425.016,"Aly, I want to thank you for your presentation and your patience today.",181,,
1033,0.97,8425.016,8428.486,I think we still have more than the 20 minutes that you said you needed.,181,,
1034,0.97,8428.486,8437.228,Please go ahead and walk us through item number two here.,181,,
1035,0.97,8437.228,8442.3,I know you have some good news and some bad news from the Federal relief dollars that we just learned more about last Monday.,181,,
1036,0.97,8442.3,8443.434,"Thank you, Councilmembers.",182,,
1037,0.97,8443.434,8448.606,I am Aly Pennucci from the Council central staff.,182,,
1038,0.97,8448.606,8456.714,I will try to keep my presentation brief and I am happy to follow up with any of you One-On-One.,182,,
1039,0.97,8456.714,8459.551,We will be back in committee discussing this topic in a couple of weeks.,182,,
1040,0.97,8459.551,8471.329,"Today, I will update the Committee on the guidance issued by the Department of the Treasury on the 10th regarding the allocation of Coronavirus local fiscal recovery funds.",182,,
1041,0.97,8471.329,8476.434,That is the flexible direct aid to cities and the eligible uses.,182,,
1042,0.97,8476.434,8493.284,We will discuss County and state spending in areas that overlap our spending priorities identified in resolution 31999 by the Council and outline next steps for the consideration of the use of these funds.,182,,
1043,0.97,8493.284,8511.769,The guidance issued on May 10 provided more detailed allocation information for the Clfr funds . The amount allocated to the city of Seattle came in at about $7 million below previous estimates that have been discussed in this Committee.,182,,
1044,0.97,8511.769,8514.772,That is the bad news that chair Mosqueda referred to.,182,,
1045,0.97,8514.772,8534.025,"For 2021, the committee will consider an appropriation bill that will authorize the spending of about $160 million, as well as considering use of some targeted aid for specific purposes that I will highlight briefly at the end of the presentation.",182,,
1046,0.97,8534.025,8546.437,The guidance issued on May 10 also included an interim final rule that provides more detailed guidance on the eligible uses of the direct aid to cities.,182,,
1047,0.97,8546.437,8559.918,"These funds provide flex ability for the city to address the needs of our community, including support for households, small businesses, impacted industries, essential workers, and the communities hardest hit by the crisis.",182,,
1048,0.97,8559.918,8570.862,"This can be used to make necessary investments in water, sewer, and Broadband.",182,,
1049,0.97,8570.862,8576.567,This is consistent with the initial guidance or what we assumed based on the language that was in the American rescue plan act.,182,,
1050,0.97,8576.567,8584.475,There is a lot of information in the detailed rule today.,182,,
1051,0.97,8584.475,8588.212,I am highlighting a few pieces related to guidance around investments that address the negative impacts of the pandemic.,182,,
1052,0.97,8588.212,8610.268,"The guidance describes use of the funds to provide assistance to workers and families, including direct cash assistance, supporting job training, and aid to households facing financial Insecurities, either through direct financial assistance or through services and programs that support workers and families.",182,,
1053,0.97,8610.268,8619.41,"It also allows for supporting small businesses, including providing loans, grants, or In- kind assistance and counseling programs to support small businesses.",182,,
1054,0.97,8619.41,8621.713,Nonprofit organizations can help to rebound during the downturn.,182,,
1055,0.97,8621.713,8634.225,And there will be investments that will speed up the recovery of the hospitality and tourism sectors as well as rebuilding the public sector.,182,,
1056,0.97,8634.225,8641.933,Councilmember Herbold?,182,,
1057,0.97,8641.933,8644.335,My apologies.,183,,
1058,0.97,8644.335,8650.942,"Quickly, as it relates to housing and security, that includes homelessness.",183,,
1059,0.97,8650.942,8665.323,"And the third bullet, closing out specific sectors for public investments, does the hospitality or tourism, is that including the arts and entertainment sector?",183,,
1060,0.97,8665.323,8673.665,"Councilmember Herbold, to the first question regarding homeless services, the guidance is a little bit unclear in that area.",184,,
1061,0.97,8673.665,8677.535,We are still digging into that.,184,,
1062,0.97,8677.535,8682.974,Is focused on providing services and resources to help get people into housing.,184,,
1063,0.97,8682.974,8698.656,We are still Sorting out exactly all of the specific eligible uses as the strategies to support neighbors experiencing homelessness are fairly broad it.,184,,
1064,0.97,8698.656,8702.96,Includes specific language about supporting certain types of public health responses for growth.,184,,
1065,0.97,8702.96,8707.598,The general public has some homelessness.,184,,
1066,0.97,8707.598,8709.801,There is more to come there.,184,,
1067,0.97,8709.801,8717.909,There is also $12.2 million for home funds that are focused on supporting people experiencing homelessness.,184,,
1068,0.97,8717.909,8733.191,"And then in terms of the language around the tourism, travel, and hospitality sectors, I have not read all of the details on that piece, but it is fairly broad.",184,,
1069,0.97,8733.191,8744.235,"I think that the arts and entertainment industry could be considered as part of that, as well as supporting small businesses.",184,,
1070,0.97,8744.235,8745.536,I think there is some flexibility there.,184,,
1071,0.97,8745.536,8746.704,I will follow-up with more information.,184,,
1072,0.97,8746.704,8747.405,"Thanks, Aly.",185,,
1073,0.97,8747.405,8750.041,See here.,186,,
1074,0.97,8750.041,8760.151,The guidance focuses on providing support to communities and families most impacted by the crisis.,186,,
1075,0.97,8760.151,8781.939,"This supports the principles the Council adopted in resolution 31999 that express the intent to Prioritize use of these funds to support individuals and families who have been disproportionately impacted by Covid-19, and to really build on the type of investments that were funded in the Jumpstart Covid relief plan in 2020 and 2021.",186,,
1076,0.97,8781.939,8789.68,"Aly, I want to Orient myself to the slides on the screen.",187,,
1077,0.97,8789.68,8794.085,"In a previous presentation, you had what was in the resolution verses what the guidance said.",187,,
1078,0.97,8794.085,8796.154,Is that how these are also oriented?,187,,
1079,0.97,8796.154,8800.391,No.,188,,
1080,0.97,8800.391,8806.197,This was just a space Saver on this particular slide to separate out the language in the guidance for those hardest hit.,188,,
1081,0.97,8806.197,8815.406,It provides some specific language about what the guidance says about how we identify the communities that are hardest hit.,188,,
1082,0.97,8815.406,8823.981,The bright portion of the slide is sort of describing what the intent is around how we might to find those populations.,188,,
1083,0.97,8823.981,8847.738,"Again, there are some specific language involving serving families who live in qualified census tracts or supporting services or businesses within those qualified census tracts, but also provides language to support other Geographies that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.",188,,
1084,0.97,8847.738,8865.156,"We have not yet, but will go through the exercise of looking at what is identified as a qualified census tract in Seattle, as well as the work that the city has done to identify areas of the city that are at high risk of displacement or do not have good access to opportunity.",188,,
1085,0.97,8865.156,8866.424,Great.,189,,
1086,0.97,8866.424,8873.731,Thank you very much.,189,,
1087,0.97,8873.731,8882.673,This slide highlights the information for funds that are not eligible for use from Clfr funds.,190,,
1088,0.97,8882.673,8890.681,"For the most part, the priorities identified in the resolution do appear to be eligible uses of the funds.",190,,
1089,0.97,8890.681,8902.627,The one piece at point out that was included in the resolution is investments in critical transportation infrastructure.,190,,
1090,0.97,8902.627,8919.61,"That would not be eligible unless it is needed to respond to pandemic related public health needs or is an investment that would have been funded otherwise but for reductions to the Department of transportation's budget due to revenue, reduced revenues in 2021.",190,,
1091,0.97,8919.61,8930.187,"This slide, I just list the categories to Prioritize the use of Federal funds identified in the resolution.",190,,
1092,0.97,8930.187,8944.735,"I highlight some of the proposed, so slides 7 through 11 highlight proposed appropriations of the county and the state that overlap or complement these priorities.",190,,
1093,0.97,8944.735,8956.247,This is a highlight of many of the proposed investments.,190,,
1094,0.97,8956.314,8957.081,T is not comprehensive.,190,,
1095,0.97,8957.081,8958.649,The county is still Deliberating on their proposal.,190,,
1096,0.97,8958.649,8969.16,Some of these numbers may change as they finalize their decisions.,190,,
1097,0.97,8969.16,8972.863,I am not going to spend a lot of time going through the details on these slides.,190,,
1098,0.97,8972.863,8980.137,"If Councilmembers have any questions, I am happy to talk off-line and bring along other analysts who have some more details on some of these specific investment areas.",190,,
1099,0.97,8980.137,8990.481,"Just to Orient you to the slides themselves, the topics in bold like vaccines and testing, that is an identified spending category in the resolution.",190,,
1100,0.97,8990.481,8998.456,"Underneath that, it highlights some of the areas in this case at the county that support those priorities.",190,,
1101,0.97,8998.456,9021.012,This can be used moving forward as the committee considers the appropriations bill in areas where there may be sufficient resources provided by the state or the county and where there are opportunities to complement or be a partner with the county in supporting certain services or programs.,190,,
1102,0.97,9021.012,9045.936,"This is again consistent with the principles laid out in the resolution where the Council highlighted as a priority Leveraging shared resources to ensure that the response of the city is addressing gaps in service and to expand the financial partnership with the county to support County programs and services that benefit workers, Nonprofits, and small businesses throughout Seattle.",190,,
1103,0.97,9045.936,9049.84,"Well said, Aly.",191,,
1104,0.97,9049.84,9058.916,"This is an important effort for us to look at how we can be aligned in certain investment areas, ring programs and services to scale, or identify with the county is stepping in.",191,,
1105,0.97,9058.916,9064.422,That means the city is able to take resources into another category.,191,,
1106,0.97,9064.422,9070.561,Thank you for orienting us to this slide.,191,,
1107,0.97,9070.561,9074.765,The bold is where we have language that Replicates what is in our priorities from the resolution.,191,,
1108,0.97,9074.765,9087.378,"The bullets are still to be discussed, as you see in the note with the Asterisk at the bottom.",191,,
1109,0.97,9087.378,9089.313,"Vice chair 2012, do you have a comment?",191,,
1110,0.97,9089.313,9089.58,Yes.,192,,
1111,0.97,9089.58,9099.19,"Do we have a level of detail that would let us know whether or not any of the investments under housing, homelessness and housing services include acquisition of buildings for sheltering?",192,,
1112,0.97,9099.19,9106.697,"I believe we do have that level of detail, but I don't have it in front of me.",193,,
1113,0.97,9106.697,9110.067,You are specifically talking about the proposed spending by the county?,193,,
1114,0.97,9110.067,9112.203,Correct.,194,,
1115,0.97,9112.203,9114.572,I can follow up on that information.,195,,
1116,0.97,9114.572,9122.78,The materials are available Online.,195,,
1117,0.97,9122.78,9125.015,"We can dig and check with County staff, as well.",195,,
1118,0.97,9125.015,9135.926,"There has been recent announcements with some of the funds the city is using--excuse me, the county is using from a different source to support acquisition, like hotels, for example.",195,,
1119,0.97,9135.926,9138.996,But that is not from this source of funds?,196,,
1120,0.97,9138.996,9143.501,"That is not included in this list, I believe.",197,,
1121,0.97,9143.501,9148.138,"The $50 million, I just need to double check.",197,,
1122,0.97,9148.138,9162.953,"The bill from the county is direct aid to counties . He it is also using other funding sources such as their reserves and, I think, a couple of other resources from the county.",197,,
1123,0.97,9162.953,9164.622,Thank you.,198,,
1124,0.97,9164.622,9181.472,"So this slide is just a continuation of the same, but it is focusing on a couple of other categories.",199,,
1125,0.97,9181.472,9183.007,I will not dive into the details here.,199,,
1126,0.97,9183.007,9194.451,"I would say the investments are lined with many of the principles and priorities aligned in the Council resolution, such as supporting Job-Training programs, Prioritizing investments in Bipoc businesses and economic resiliency and that sort of thing.",199,,
1127,0.97,9194.451,9212.903,"Similarly, the state budget that the Council had a more detailed briefing on from our colleagues in Hawaii are on Monday, I will spend much time here, but this is some sampling of some of the investments that are included in the recently adopted budget by the state.",199,,
1128,0.97,9212.903,9220.411,"Just a clarification on that though, Aly . These are statewide numbers, correct?",200,,
1129,0.97,9220.411,9221.078,That is correct.,201,,
1130,0.97,9221.078,9225.316,Some of this may flow to the city.,201,,
1131,0.97,9225.316,9236.727,"Most of it will flow through other agencies and organizations like businesses, Renters, and landlords will have access to those funds.",201,,
1132,0.97,9236.727,9239.096,Thank you very much.,202,,
1133,0.97,9239.096,9245.636,"Hello, Councilmember Morales.",203,,
1134,0.97,9245.636,9255.346,"For the member, Councilmember Morales has been with us since public testimony and has been a regular participant in finance and housing even when not an alternate technically.",203,,
1135,0.97,9255.346,9259.25,"We appreciate you being here with us, Councilmember Morales.",203,,
1136,0.97,9259.25,9261.852,Thank you for joining in.,203,,
1137,0.97,9261.852,9263.954,Thank you.,204,,
1138,0.97,9263.954,9294.585,"Going back to sort of a recovery and equitable investments, I am curious if there is any specific funding item that does talk about, for example, land acquisition, how we would support Micro business development, access to capital for Micro-Businesses, that sort of thing.",204,,
1139,0.97,9294.585,9302.192,"Either in the King County priorities that you were talking about, Aly, or how that is reflected in the other areas that we are interested in.",204,,
1140,0.97,9302.192,9313.871,The language and the guidance from the Treasury is primarily focused on addressing the economic impacts of businesses or workers who were impacted.,205,,
1141,0.97,9313.871,9323.213,"So far, I have come across very specific language, although it may be in there.",205,,
1142,0.97,9323.213,9325.683,The document is about 150 pages.,205,,
1143,0.97,9325.683,9326.917,We will double check.,205,,
1144,0.97,9326.917,9340.698,There is clear language about acquisition to support investments in affordable Ousing and supporting businesses through helping to secure long-term leases and addressing background and that type of thing.,205,,
1145,0.97,9340.698,9351.041,"Specific to Micro-Businesses or land acquisition as a more general principle for long-term community wealth building, that type of thing, I will need to get back to you about that.",205,,
1146,0.97,9351.041,9351.842,Okay.,206,,
1147,0.97,9351.842,9355.546,Thank you.,206,,

1150,0.97,9374.098,9377.701,"Land acquisition and equitable development, capacity building is something we have heard a lot about during public testimony.",207,,
1151,0.97,9377.701,9382.973,I look forward to hearing more about that and how that can lead into our priorities along the lines of the new guidance that we just got.,207,,
1152,0.97,9382.973,9383.774,Next steps.,208,,
1153,0.97,9383.774,9399.456,The plan is to introduce an appropriation bill on June 1 that will include authorizing spending at $160 million of Clfr funds as well as $12.2 million of Arpa partnership funds.,208,,

1157,0.97,9446.737,9453.443,"At the Finance and housing Committee, the second Committee in June, there will be a discussion and possible vote on amendments and the bill or potentially bills.",208,,
1158,0.97,9453.443,9462.319,"For technical reasons, there may be a need to have more than one bill to consider these investments.",208,,
1159,0.97,9462.319,9463.854,We are still working out those details.,208,,
1160,0.97,9463.854,9468.225,That was all I had for prepared presentation.,208,,
1161,0.97,9468.225,9470.527,I am happy to address additional questions.,208,,
1162,0.97,9470.527,9476.166,"Before you to questions, I want to say thank you, Aly, for spearheading this conversation.",209,,
1163,0.97,9476.166,9492.049,I know the number few have been in many conversations with the Council President . We think her for her leadership on this.,209,,

1165,0.97,9503.627,9508.298,We are now in the process of Aligning those with what is possible in the guidance that we received.,209,,

1170,0.97,9535.525,9538.328,We need a lot more.,209,,
1171,0.97,9538.328,9539.863,Please go ahead.,209,,
1172,0.97,9539.863,9556.847,"Wanting to understand a little bit more given the Timeline that is being proposed, how we will find out more about --",210,,
1173,0.97,9556.847,9560.918,I think Councilmember Herbold may be frozen?,211,,
1174,0.97,9560.918,9569.159,I think I got the general intent of the question around when we will find out more about King County.,211,,
1175,0.97,9569.159,9574.865,I believe that bill is before their committee.,211,,
1176,0.97,9574.865,9575.933,Sorry.,212,,
1177,0.97,9575.933,9579.403,"Childcare investments, as well.",213,,

1179,0.97,9589.746,9596.853,"Councilmember Herbold, your Video and Audio is cutting out, if you can hear me.",214,,
1180,0.97,9596.853,9605.562,"I believe we are catching what you are interested in, specifically the Childcare piece.",214,,
1181,0.97,9605.562,9608.532,"Aly, I will turn it over to you.",214,,
1182,0.97,9608.532,9613.103,"Councilmember Herbold, apologies for speaking over you.",214,,

1185,0.97,9623.68,9627.718,"A bill has been introduced, I don't have the number in front of me, but I can distribute a link.",215,,
1186,0.97,9627.718,9629.219,It is being discussed in committee this week.,215,,
1187,0.97,9629.219,9639.93,I think the plan is that the county will act on their appropriation bill by the end of the month . that was the last update I had.,215,,
1188,0.97,9639.93,9648.638,It will be before this Committee is being asked to make a decision on appropriations bill.,215,,
1189,0.97,9648.638,9657.314,We will continue to track that and seek additional details that can help inform your decisions about where to complement some of those investments.,215,,
1190,0.97,9657.314,9663.487,"Sorry about that, Councilmember Herbold.",216,,
1191,0.97,9663.487,9664.688,You were cutting out a little bit.,216,,
1192,0.97,9664.688,9667.024,Were you able to hear Aly's answer?,216,,
1193,0.97,9667.024,9668.925,I got the gist of it.,217,,
1194,0.97,9668.925,9672.629,Thank you.,217,,
1195,0.97,9672.629,9673.43,Great question.,218,,
1196,0.97,9673.43,9674.765,I am not seeing any additional questions.,218,,
1197,0.97,9674.765,9686.043,"As a reminder, we will, as Aly mentioned, have this be our last meeting without an actual draft bill in front of you.",218,,

1199,0.97,9691.348,9695.385,We know that this Federal guidance has been helpful.,218,,
1200,0.97,9695.385,9706.196,It is also discouraging that we got $7 million less than we thought we would receive we are trying to crunch those numbers and reflect some of the priorities we continue to hear about.,218,,
1201,0.97,9706.196,9707.764,It has been a lot of work.,218,,
1202,0.97,9707.764,9710.6,Thank you to the entire team that has been working on this.,218,,
1203,0.97,9710.6,9720.377,"Because of the holiday, this will not be introduced on May 31, but instead June 1, as Aly noted.",218,,
1204,0.97,9720.377,9723.413,We will have a meeting in our Finance and housing Committe meeting.,218,,
1205,0.97,9723.413,9726.817,Note that it is on a Friday.,218,,
1206,0.97,9726.817,9731.922,"Because of the holiday, we moved from Tuesday to Friday.",218,,
1207,0.97,9731.922,9735.192,"At our June 4 meeting, we will be devoted to walking through that draft proposal.",218,,
1208,0.97,9735.192,9755.312,"We have a hold on your calendar, not only on the 15th, which is our normal meeting day, but also on the 16th in case we need two meetings, as we did previously to make sure we can accommodate discussions . We will make sure to keep you updated as we get closer to those times.",218,,
1209,0.97,9755.312,9761.051,"If you could graciously hold those dates, that would be greatly appreciated.",218,,
1210,0.97,9761.051,9762.352,Are there questions?,218,,
1211,0.97,9762.352,9767.257,"Hearing none, Aly, thank you for walking us through.",218,,
1212,0.97,9767.257,9768.458,Guess what?,218,,
1213,0.97,9768.458,9770.527,It is 12:15.,218,,
1214,0.97,9770.527,9772.829,We are on time for our new aligned agenda.,218,,
1215,0.97,9772.829,9777.067,So let's move on to item number three.,218,,
1216,0.97,9777.067,9778.668,Can you please read that into the record?,218,,

1220,0.97,9800.39,9802.759,She has provided us with a memo any presentation.,220,,
1221,0.97,9802.759,9808.298,"Councilmember 12, do you have any opening comments that you would like to share?",220,,
1222,0.97,9808.298,9821.444,"In the interest of time and because my Internet is unstable, I will handed over to Karina and thank her for her work in this continuing conversation.",221,,
1223,0.97,9821.444,9822.712,Our last meeting was on May 4.,221,,
1224,0.97,9822.712,9825.782,This is a work in progress.,221,,
1225,0.97,9825.782,9833.89,"I think through Karina's presentation, we will see how the legislation has changed and some additional amendments for consideration.",221,,
1226,0.97,9833.89,9835.892,There is no plan to vote today.,221,,
1227,0.97,9835.892,9840.597,Thank you.,221,,
1228,0.97,9840.597,9841.231,"Hello, everyone.",222,,
1229,0.97,9841.231,9845.235,I am Karina bull with Council central staff.,222,,
1230,0.97,9845.235,9851.942,"Per Councilmember Herbold's introduction, I have a presentation.",222,,
1231,0.97,9851.942,9875.332,"It should highlight the introduced legislation and focus on some changes from the draft that was discussed on May 4. as Councilmember Herbold said, it will bring some issues to the Councilmember attention for consideration.",222,,
1232,0.97,9875.332,9890.18,"To begin, the introduced legislation would require commercial hiring entities, the legal term for business in this legislation, to provide independent contractors with Precontract disclosures, timely payments, and payment disclosures for services valued at $600 or more.",222,,
1233,0.97,9890.18,9894.05,"These requirements become effective on March 1, 2022.",222,,
1234,0.97,9894.05,9896.052,They would be implemented by the office of labor standards.,222,,
1235,0.97,9896.052,9901.825,The policy changes began with hiring entity coverage.,222,,
1236,0.97,9901.825,9915.972,This legislation would fully Delimited to covering commercial hiring entities at the time.,222,,
1237,0.97,9915.972,9919.409,"At the last meeting, it was discussed that any hiring entity of a domestic worker would be removed.",222,,
1238,0.97,9919.409,9920.777,That is reflected in this legislation.,222,,
1239,0.97,9920.777,9931.621,"Next, there is a new requirement to address the needs of small businesses that may have a difficult time administering the requirements of this legislation.",222,,
1240,0.97,9931.621,9936.893,That can be for intermittent contracts or smaller contracts.,222,,
1241,0.97,9936.893,9949.839,There is any requirement for a value of services . This legislation would only cover independent contractor services with a proposed actual or expected compensation value of $600 or more in the calendar year.,222,,
1242,0.97,9949.839,9958.848,"Next, transportation network companies would still be required to provide their drivers with timely payment.",222,,
1243,0.97,9958.848,9962.819,They would not be required to provide Precontract or payment disclosures.,222,,
1244,0.97,9962.819,9976.333,They would still be required to comply with the TNC minimum compensation ordinance that was passed last year and went into effect in January.,222,,
1245,0.97,9976.333,9984.174,That law requires payment of minimum compensation and does require payment disclosures . It does not require something akin to a Precontract disclosure or that sort of thing.,222,,
1246,0.97,9984.174,9995.785,This law would recognize that discussions were already had with the TNC companies and drivers for their needs.,222,,
1247,0.97,9995.785,10000.657,"This legislation would focus on the timely payment and the notice of rights, as well.",222,,
1248,0.97,10000.657,10001.992,"Next, a Presumptive contract.",222,,
1249,0.97,10001.992,10017.04,"At the last meeting, there was discussion about how the draft legislation would have a presumption of a contract in the enforcement context.",222,,
1250,0.97,10017.04,10038.228,"That means that if a hiring entity had not provided a Precontract disclosure or had a Precontract disclosure and did not honor it, if there was a play meant--a payment claim, there would be an automatic presumption that the Precontract disclosure had turned into a contractor and the contractor began work.",222,,
1251,0.97,10038.228,10044.134,"In the absence of that Precontract disclosure, the independent contractor claims for payments were true.",222,,
1252,0.97,10044.134,10061.317,"In the introduced legislation, that Presumptive contract now begins for any services that are provided.",222,,
1253,0.97,10061.317,10064.454,That Presumptive contract just happens immediately when the contractor begins agreed-upon work for the hiring entity.,222,,
1254,0.97,10064.454,10067.057,It does not wait necessarily until there is a payment claim.,222,,
1255,0.97,10067.057,10069.359,Is likely to come up in the context of a payment claim.,222,,
1256,0.97,10069.359,10081.471,There is still the presumption in the enforcement context for situations where an independent contractor was not given a Precontract disclosure.,222,,
1257,0.97,10081.471,10092.482,"Last, model notices, those are required for any hiring entity to provide in English and the primary language of the independent contractor.",222,,
1258,0.97,10092.482,10115.004,"He office of labor standards is required to create and distribute those model notices and include those translations by date that this law would go into effect on March 1, 2022, so that all businesses and independent contractors would be ready to go with information that they need for this law to be successful.",222,,
1259,0.97,10115.004,10127.15,Just a couple of issues for the Council for consideration.,222,,
1260,0.97,10129.085,10130.72,One is the coverage of government entities.,222,,
1261,0.97,10130.72,10138.795,"The law is silent on whether these requirements would apply to government entities, so it is something that the Council may want to consider about whether the city of Seattle should be explicitly including, included as a hiring entity.",222,,
1262,0.97,10138.795,10144.701,"Right now, it would be implicitly included.",222,,
1263,0.97,10144.701,10147.337,That could be value to declaring that the city of Seattle is covered.,222,,
1264,0.97,10147.337,10149.539,"And also, to what extent the city of Seattle is covered.",222,,
1265,0.97,10149.539,10160.717,"For example, the legislation would need to make it clear that coverage may only apply to situations when the city is acting as a commercial hiring entity.",222,,
1266,0.97,10160.717,10166.022,They would need to be more research on what situations that would apply to.,222,,
1267,0.97,10166.022,10171.461,It could be public utilities or city light.,222,,
1268,0.97,10171.461,10173.963,Was Maybe the only situations.,222,,
1269,0.97,10173.963,10175.165,Or there may be other ones.,222,,
1270,0.97,10175.165,10188.745,Another option for the Council to consider is coverage for any contract that the city of Seattle enters into.,222,,
1271,0.97,10189.045,10189.979,That would be for Childcare.,222,,
1272,0.97,10189.979,10191.147,It could be for mediation services.,222,,
1273,0.97,10191.147,10194.651,"There are, of course, a Plethora of different kind of contracts that the city of Seattle enters into.",222,,
1274,0.97,10194.651,10201.758,Another option is to explicitly exclude the city of Seattle from hiring entity coverage.,222,,
1275,0.97,10201.758,10219.175,"Item C is to exclude other government entities from coverage that could include King County, local government, Federal Government, a combination of any of those options, or make no changes to the legislation and the result would be that the city of Seattle is covered as a commercial hiring entity.",222,,
1276,0.97,10219.175,10221.01,Just would not be explicitly announced.,222,,
1277,0.97,10221.01,10225.682,Are there any questions about that before I go on?,222,,
1278,0.97,10225.682,10227.55,"Hearing none, I will move on.",222,,
1279,0.97,10227.55,10229.986,I have one.,223,,
1280,0.97,10229.986,10231.521,Go ahead.,224,,
1281,0.97,10231.521,10242.599,If you could Reacquaint us with the definition as is currently drafted for a commercial hiring entity?,225,,
1282,0.97,10242.599,10243.399,"Yes, I will.",226,,
1283,0.97,10243.399,10253.343,"I will turn to that in my copy of the legislation . As I said earlier, it is essentially the legal term for a business.",226,,
1284,0.97,10253.343,10270.827,"With the legislation says is that it is an entity that is regularly engaged in business or commercial activity, which regularly is engaged in business or commercial activity.",226,,
1285,0.97,10270.827,10284.641,"The entity would own or operate in any trade business, including a Not-For-Profit business, or holds itself out as engaging in any trade or occupation.",226,,
1286,0.97,10284.641,10305.161,And so the question here is whether or not for clarity's sake we need to explicitly define whether or not the city of Seattle is considered commercial hiring entity.,227,,
1287,0.97,10305.161,10308.798,I think there are a couple of different ways that the legislation could go about it.,228,,
1288,0.97,10308.798,10314.504,One could be that the city could be announced as covered.,228,,
1289,0.97,10314.504,10317.307,The law would cover commercial hiring entity or the city.,228,,
1290,0.97,10317.307,10334.624,"Or could be the law covers commercial hiring entities and the city, to the extent that engages in commercial hiring entity operations . or the city could be added to the definition of a commercial hiring entity.",228,,
1291,0.97,10334.624,10337.06,There are a number of different ways that could be accomplished.,228,,
1292,0.97,10337.06,10340.229,Thank you.,229,,
1293,0.97,10340.229,10344.734,Other questions?,230,,
1294,0.97,10344.734,10360.216,"The next issue is regarding value of services . As I mentioned earlier, the legislation would cover situations where a contractor is hired to provide services that are valued at $600 or more in a calendar year.",231,,
1295,0.97,10360.216,10382.538,The reason why this specific amount was selected is because the Internal Revenue Service already requires businesses to report on a 1099-Nec form the amount of Nonemployee compensation that is paid to workers of $600 or more.,231,,
1296,0.97,10382.538,10383.573,That is a nice alignment.,231,,
1297,0.97,10383.573,10386.376,The lines with the type of reporting that businesses are already required to do.,231,,
1298,0.97,10386.376,10392.081,"As time marches on, that $600 will be worth a different amount in the future.",231,,
1299,0.97,10392.081,10410.233,Council may want to consider changing legislation or letting it become stagnant or less applicable in the future.,231,,
1300,0.97,10410.433,10419.709,There could be language stating that the $600 will be changed to reflect any change in the IRS reporting requirements for Nonemployee compensation.,231,,
1301,0.97,10419.709,10433.055,Another option is that the $600 could be changed to reflect the rate of inflation.,231,,
1302,0.97,10433.99,10436.392,"And then of course, another option is not to make a change.",231,,
1303,0.97,10436.392,10449.839,"For either a or B, the could be a requirement that the office of labor standards would need to determine the amount and file it with the city clerk and make sure to do some outreach and announcements so both independent contractors and businesses are aware of this change in the value of services.",231,,
1304,0.97,10449.839,10450.807,"Yes, Tom Emmer Herbold?",231,,
1305,0.97,10450.807,10460.983,"Just to clarify, a and B are two different approaches of adjusting the value of services, correct?",232,,
1306,0.97,10460.983,10461.951,"Yes, they are.",233,,
1307,0.97,10461.951,10462.351,Thank you.,234,,
1308,0.97,10462.351,10482.071,"Just to provide some background, in the legislation, as is typical with any labor standards, the amounts of civil penalties and fines are adjusted each year to reflect the rate of inflation and the minimum compensation law, the minimum compensation is adjusted every year.",235,,
1309,0.97,10482.071,10490.179,There is a standard practice of adjusting amounts to reflect the rate of inflation.,235,,
1310,0.97,10490.179,10493.649,"If that is something that Councilmembers are interested in for this law, it could be applied at $600.",235,,
1311,0.97,10493.649,10500.556,But it may not align with that IRS reporting requirement.,235,,
1312,0.97,10500.556,10510.9,Last of the financial impact on the city in regards to the cost for office of labor standards to implement this law is something that Council may want to consider.,235,,
1313,0.97,10510.9,10526.082,Council has asked or less their estimate of what it would cost to implement this legislation.,235,,
1314,0.97,10526.082,10527.25,"Their initial estimate is up to $684,000.",235,,
1315,0.97,10527.25,10530.62,"That is $60,000 in one-time funds and $624,000 in ongoing funds.",235,,
1316,0.97,10530.62,10539.328,"This would be for three positions, a senior investigator, Paralegal, and an engagement specialist that would conduct outreach.",235,,
1317,0.97,10539.328,10551.14,"This would cover administrative expenses to Onboard those positions, to pay for model notices, creation of core documents.",235,,
1318,0.97,10551.14,10556.445,There is a piece of legislation in the enforcement section that establishes 22 types of enforcement mechanisms for office of labor standards.,235,,
1319,0.97,10556.445,10567.356,"There is a complaint procedure, which is a Nonadversarial exchange of documents that or less would facilitate.",235,,
1320,0.97,10567.356,10571.861,And there is a core navigation procedure where or less will provide outreach on how to access the court for independent contractors.,235,,
1321,0.97,10571.861,10585.274,"Both of those procedures and mechanisms were designed to reduce the workload on office of labor standards . to get them running, it could take some extra work on their part.",235,,
1322,0.97,10585.274,10587.677,"Yes, Councilmember Herbold?",235,,
1323,0.97,10587.677,10610.199,"I just want to note here that it appears to me, we just heard from the domestic workers standards board and or less about how the lack of funding for outreach has brought them back to us to seek additional funding.",236,,
1324,0.97,10610.199,10618.374,"I think the number that we heard was $35,000 for outreach for that bill.",236,,
1325,0.97,10618.374,10620.009,I recognize that there is a need.,236,,
1326,0.97,10620.009,10632.989,This number makes me feel like there is sort of a fundamental misunderstanding about what our expectations are around enforcement for this legislation.,236,,
1327,0.97,10632.989,10642.732,Is not C█Lear to me how much of these ongoing annual costs are associated with enforcement.,236,,
1328,0.97,10642.732,10648.037,I think we need to have a bit of the conversation with Ols.,236,,
1329,0.97,10648.037,10663.653,I think enforcement expectations are really that this is a law that is intended to empower workers to assert their rights without relying on Ols to enforce the law.,236,,
1330,0.97,10663.653,10676.665,I am flagging that and recognizing that this proposed price tag for ongoing annual costs is there.,236,,
1331,0.97,10676.665,10704.493,"I am interested in figuring out, given the effective date and the work that actually needs to be done before the effective date of the legislation in next year's budget process, whether or not we can sequence Addressin the needs of Ols in a way that corresponds to our expectations for rolling out the ordinance.",236,,
1332,0.97,10704.493,10722.178,"Yeah, that certainly would be helpful to hear from office of labor standards whether in a committee meeting or Off- line, as well, to compare this legislation to other laws that have been recently passed that have been funded or not funded.",237,,
1333,0.97,10722.178,10730.486,"My notes remind me that office of labor standards received about $276,000 to implement the domestic worker ordinance for two positions.",237,,
1334,0.97,10730.486,10736.192,"And about $300,000 to implement the TNC minimum compensation for drivers ordinance.",237,,
1335,0.97,10736.192,10739.228,There are two positions for that.,237,,
1336,0.97,10739.228,10754.61,What or less said when they provided this estimate to central staff is that they believe that this block has a wider scope than any law that has been passed since the minimum wage for all employees in Seattle.,237,,
1337,0.97,10754.61,10761.55,It is their thought that this would have a wide scope for outreach.,237,,
1338,0.97,10761.55,10776.966,"As far as what you are saying, Councilmember Herbold, about a much more limited scope of enforcement, that would certainly benefit from hearing from office of labor standards on that approach and how that might impact this estimate.",237,,
1339,0.97,10776.966,10780.369,"I hear what you are saying, Karina.",238,,
1340,0.97,10780.369,10793.082,Perhaps broader scope for outreach to notify covered employers and workers of the obligations.,238,,
1341,0.97,10793.082,10798.954,But a more narrow scope for enforcement.,238,,
1342,0.97,10798.954,10803.792,"I want to see that the numbers, he estimates that or less is providing Aligns with that.",238,,
1343,0.97,10803.792,10834.49,"I also want to just lift up that the reason why this potentially has a broad scope for purposes of notifying workers and the folks who are contracting with workers for these tasks, the reason why it is a broader scope is because this is an area that is growing.",238,,
1344,0.97,10834.49,10840.996,There are more workers who are working as contract workers.,238,,
1345,0.97,10840.996,10860.049,"And so I think, I agree the need for funding for outreach to make sure that both workers and the contract employers are adhering to the requirements of the ordinance.",238,,
1346,0.97,10860.049,10867.256,I also want to make sure that or less understands it is a narrower expectation on the enforcement side.,238,,
1347,0.97,10867.256,10880.169,"Again, these are intended to be rights that are, that empower workers to assert their rights.",238,,
1348,0.97,10880.169,10893.949,"So operationally, Councilmember, how do we, how do you want to address making sure that those misunderstandings or potential points of confusion are addressed with Ols?",239,,
1349,0.97,10893.949,10900.656,I think just more conversation that we need to continue to have.,240,,
1350,0.97,10900.656,10901.857,Okay.,241,,
1351,0.97,10901.857,10903.559,"Okay, great.",241,,
1352,0.97,10903.559,10905.561,Thank you for keeping us updated.,241,,
1353,0.97,10905.561,10907.997,Appreciate it.,241,,
1354,0.97,10907.997,10934.99,"This next page on options is not to be discussed, but is something for Council to consider .'s are options for responding to or less's estimates could include adding money to their budget during the supplemental budget process, the next year budget process.",242,,
1355,0.97,10940.796,10957.146,Or less has proposed that delaying the effective date--Ols has proposed that delaying the effective date could help.,242,,
1356,0.97,10957.146,10970.359,Or they can receive no medication and move forward with what they have done with other topics.,242,,
1357,0.97,10970.359,10971.56,That concludes my presentation on this.,242,,
1358,0.97,10971.56,10973.228,Are there any questions?,242,,
1359,0.97,10973.228,10976.465,I am not seeing any questions.,243,,
1360,0.97,10976.465,10981.337,"Councilmember Herbold, any additional questions?",243,,
1361,0.97,10981.337,10984.64,"Do you want to walk us through the Timeline you are thinking of, as well?",243,,
1362,0.97,10984.64,11012.201,"Continued discussions with both the office of labor standards and Lsac as well as working with Washington on a number of items within the bill itself, both as it relates to the fiscal impact of the bill and some of the items that Karina queued up today.",244,,
1363,0.97,11012.201,11026.815,We are trying to clear up some misunderstandings about the expanded scope of the bill beyond what was recommended by Lsac.,244,,
1364,0.97,11026.815,11047.803,"As it relates to the pay up campaign, requests for the commitment of the Council around a minimum compensation standard, still talking with them through the Timeline expectations in that legislation.",244,,
1365,0.97,11047.803,11052.241,I think we are hopefully going to be back in early June.,244,,
1366,0.97,11052.241,11052.841,"Okay, great.",245,,
1367,0.97,11052.841,11054.042,We will stay tuned.,245,,
1368,0.97,11054.042,11055.043,Appreciate it.,245,,
1369,0.97,11055.043,11060.149,"Karina, anything else from your perspective?",245,,
1370,0.97,11060.149,11060.949,That is all.,246,,
1371,0.97,11060.949,11063.285,Thank you for allowing me to be here today.,246,,
1372,0.97,11063.285,11067.056,I appreciate your time.,247,,
1373,0.97,11067.056,11069.925,"I know the domestic worker's bill of rights is probably interesting, as well.",247,,
1374,0.97,11069.925,11071.66,It has your fingerprints on it.,247,,
1375,0.97,11071.66,11082.905,We appreciate you being with us this morning and afternoon.,247,,
1376,0.97,11082.905,11084.139,We are slightly ahead of time.,247,,
1377,0.97,11084.139,11086.575,I thought we were going to 1:00 and to be pushing it.,247,,
1378,0.97,11086.575,11088.31,I want to thank all of our colleagues.,247,,
1379,0.97,11088.31,11089.445,You have been true champions today.,247,,
1380,0.97,11089.445,11091.046,Thanks for staying on the line with us.,247,,
1381,0.97,11091.046,11113.602,"As a reminder, we have a meeting on Friday, June 4. we will have the Arpa direct aid bill . We will have transparency requirements for contract workers.",247,,
1382,0.97,11113.602,11117.206,We will also have the housing levy administration and finance plan and policies in front of us.,247,,
1383,0.97,11117.206,11122.311,We will follow-up on additional budget related items.,247,,
1384,0.97,11122.311,11124.146,Thanks so much to everyone for your time today.,247,,
1385,0.97,11124.146,11133.489,"If there is nothing else, have a wonderful afternoon and we hope everybody gets a little bit of sunshine before the rain comes.",247,,
1386,0.97,11133.489,11140.429,Thank you so much.,247,,
