8,0.97,41.875,42.876,Three present.,5,,
9,0.97,42.876,43.71,"Thank you, Ted.",6,,
10,0.97,43.71,46.913,And thank you to the Councilmembers.,6,,
11,0.97,46.913,54.521,Councilmember Nelson said she is going to be 10 minutes late to the meeting and she will likely join the meeting soon.,6,,
12,0.97,54.521,58.591,We have three discussions on today's agenda.,6,,
13,0.97,58.591,75.442,"First the committee will discuss and vote on an ordinance presented by Councilmember Strauss that changes the Timeline for payment plans, repaying the back rent that members may owe during the pandemic.",6,,
14,0.97,75.442,85.151,"On May 11th, 2020, shortly after the public health emergency started the Councilmember passed a bill to pay off rent a dent in installments.",6,,
15,0.97,85.151,98.498,"However that bill spreads the installments over six months, which could be a very short period of time now that the Covid emergency has lasted over two years.",6,,
16,0.97,98.498,109.809,It is unfortunately far from a common situation that Renters are very far behind and have Unfortunately accumulated a lot of debt.,6,,
17,0.97,109.809,118.718,In 2021 rental organizers had bill 5160 in Washington state Emma which included a similar payment plan for unpaid back rent.,6,,
18,0.97,118.718,127.46,In that case the payment plan was for payments of up to one third of a months rent each month Emma which can go longer than six months for Renters more than two months behind on rent.,6,,
19,0.97,127.46,142.442,"The bill we are voting on today Aligns the city of Seattle's payment plan Timeline with the state Timeline, which will help avoid confusion.",6,,
20,0.97,142.442,144.677,The state Timeline is legally the Timeline that applies anyway.,6,,
21,0.97,144.677,148.915,For most Renters and landlords this will not make a big change.,6,,
22,0.97,148.915,156.055,"The one exception being back rent accrued in the six months following the emergency covered by the city law, not the state law.",6,,
23,0.97,156.055,160.36,Rent for those months would be paid off.,6,,
24,0.97,160.36,166.866,This is a bill to clarify the existing laws that apply.,6,,
25,0.97,166.866,170.603,I believe we can voted out of committee today and we will have a discussion too.,6,,
26,0.97,170.603,174.474,Next on today's agenda our appointments for the city of Seattle's Renters Commission.,6,,
27,0.97,174.474,178.511,We have many vacancies because the former member failed to appoint many members last year.,6,,
28,0.97,178.511,191.224,The Commissioner has helped to fill those vacancies . He conducted interviews and made recommendations to the Mayor's office for home to appoint this year.,6,,
29,0.97,191.224,194.46,Mayor Harrell has approved those recommended appointees and the committee will discuss and vote on them.,6,,
30,0.97,194.46,202.802,"Finally, today's committee will talk to Renters at the apartments in Capitol Hill.",6,,
31,0.97,202.802,217.483,Many of the residents were invited to tell their story today.,6,,
32,0.97,217.483,221.921,A longtime owner of the building passed away and the new owners have stated that they intend to sell the building.,6,,
33,0.97,221.921,233.433,The tenants of the building have made it their home.,6,,
34,0.97,233.433,237.77,"Several tenants have lived there for over a decade because they like the building, the community, and they can afford the rent.",6,,
35,0.97,237.77,241.841,They are extremely worried the building will be sold to a developer who will Demolish the building and displace them.,6,,
36,0.97,241.841,244.577,"We heard from several low income Renters, including seniors, who address displacement.",6,,
37,0.97,244.577,245.979,The good news is they are getting organized.,6,,
38,0.97,245.979,250.45,The tenants are getting organized and they formed a tenants Association so they can come together and fight to save their homes.,6,,
39,0.97,250.45,252.585,Last year a new hope community interviewed fighting along activists.,6,,
40,0.97,252.585,259.158,"They wanted state and city funding to save the tenants at square Plaza, which was similarly addressed when it went up for sale.",6,,
41,0.97,259.158,266.266,We support a similar nonprofit.,6,,
42,0.97,266.266,268.134,We have the tenants here today to tell their story.,6,,
43,0.97,268.134,273.406,Before we begin the agenda items we have a public comment.,6,,
44,0.97,273.406,287.053,One person signed up for the public comment period I'm seeing them listed as not present.,6,,
45,0.97,287.053,287.687,"Ted, can you confirm?",6,,
46,0.97,287.687,288.721,It is David Haynes.,6,,
47,0.97,288.721,290.156,He is showing up as not present.,6,,
48,0.97,290.156,290.556,Am I right?,6,,
49,0.97,290.556,292.191,That's what I see also.,7,,
50,0.97,292.191,299.699,That would mean nobody for public comment.,7,,
51,0.97,299.699,303.569,Seeing as our loan Speaker for public comment is not present I will go ahead and close public comment.,8,,
52,0.97,303.569,306.372,We will now begin our first agenda item.,8,,
53,0.97,306.372,310.276,Cb 120305.,8,,
54,0.97,310.276,323.99,"Modifying ordinance 126081, concerning repayment plans for rental arrears accrued during or within six months after the termination of the civil emergency declared on March 3RD, 2020.",8,,
55,0.97,323.99,326.859,The staff is here to present also.,8,,
56,0.97,326.859,333.099,"Councilmember Strauss, as you are the prime sponsor of the bill would you like to introduce the legislation before Jeff speaks?",8,,
57,0.97,333.099,336.836,"Thank you, chair Sawant.",9,,
58,0.97,336.836,347.246,I would be happy to take the report and make some comments.,9,,
59,0.97,347.246,349.415,"It is a modest and technical correction, like you just described.",9,,
60,0.97,349.415,350.75,The state has already passed this legislation.,9,,
61,0.97,350.75,352.985,This is bringing our cities laws in line with the States.,9,,
62,0.97,352.985,356.255,I will see what Jeff has to say and then follow up with any more information.,9,,
63,0.97,356.255,358.825,"Thank you, chair Sawant.",9,,
64,0.97,358.825,367.834,"Thank you, Councilmember, staff.",10,,
65,0.97,367.834,380.48,I am able to share in just a moment.,10,,
66,0.97,383.216,387.453,I really only have one slide that has something visual for the public that would be useful.,10,,
67,0.97,387.453,394.327,I know the Council is well versed in this topic.,10,,
68,0.97,394.327,399.198,You can see the current city ordinance that was adopted.,10,,
69,0.97,399.198,403.97,Ordinance 126081.,10,,
70,0.97,403.97,406.806,On the right are the provisions that would be proposed in this counsel bill.,10,,
71,0.97,406.806,410.243,I will just walk through the four ways that there are substantive changes made.,10,,
72,0.97,410.243,417.85,"First, as Council member Sawant already discussed, there was a six month repayment plan initially.",10,,
73,0.97,417.85,420.486,At that point we were only a couple of months into the pandemic.,10,,
74,0.97,420.486,428.895,We didn't know there would be multiple years of rent being accrued.,10,,
75,0.97,428.895,432.765,"This would conform with the one third that has already been discussed, as what the state put into place.",10,,
76,0.97,432.765,442.308,"For the second line you can see the tenant in the original legislation that was currently adopted, the tenant can propose an alternative plan.",10,,
77,0.97,442.308,448.481,"The proposed ordinance would use the language, a reasonable schedule.",10,,
78,0.97,448.481,450.683,That mirrors what is said in the state statute.,10,,
79,0.97,450.683,458.691,It would have a variety of factors potentially.,10,,
80,0.97,458.691,460.693,It is mostly a technical language difference.,10,,
81,0.97,460.693,463.095,"Third, you can see what we discussed.",10,,
82,0.97,463.095,470.97,This is in line with the revisions that is in line with what the state has passed.,10,,
83,0.97,470.97,472.004,The state code is there.,10,,
84,0.97,472.004,475.041,It was intentional of course.,10,,
85,0.97,475.041,476.475,The primary difference is the fourth line.,10,,
86,0.97,476.475,478.311,This is what I wanted to highlight for the committee.,10,,
87,0.97,478.311,484.984,"What the state has enacted, this actually isn't well reflected on the slide.",10,,
88,0.97,484.984,489.989,"What is currently in place, the state plan would Supersede it.",10,,
89,0.97,489.989,496.028,He would have a long period of time with rent capped at one third.,10,,
90,0.97,496.028,507.773,"But the rent that would be covered or is covered by the state ordinance, this is what happens with the current effective law for the city as well.",10,,
91,0.97,507.773,519.418,Once the governor ends the Declaration of emergency for the public health emergency no rent after that time must be incorporated into the payment plan.,10,,
92,0.97,519.418,531.163,"The proposal today, 120305, it ties to the Mayor's Declaration of civil emergency, plus an additional six months.",10,,
93,0.97,531.163,552.485,"If the Mayor and the governor did not rescind the orders at the same time there would be potentially, for example if Mayor Harrell took a month longer to rescind the state of emergency tenants would have two months longer, because of how the bill ties to the city's action.",10,,
94,0.97,552.485,563.329,And they would have six additional months as well because the proposed legislation is not only the end of the civil emergency but also six months afterwards.,10,,
95,0.97,563.329,568.434,"If the Mayor and the governor were in lockstep and rescinded their orders at the same time, rent coverage for six months after that.",10,,
96,0.97,568.434,578.377,The termination of those orders would still be captured under the repayment plan if counsel bill 120305 was adopted.,10,,
97,0.97,578.377,581.18,With that I turn it over to the Councilmembers.,10,,
98,0.97,581.18,584.884,"Thank you, Jeff, for that presentation.",11,,
99,0.97,584.884,593.693,"Other Councilmembers, if you would like to speak.",11,,
100,0.97,593.693,594.694,"Thank you, chair Sawant.",12,,
101,0.97,594.694,595.828,That was a technical presentation.,12,,
102,0.97,595.828,598.331,"Thank you, Jeff, for your work.",12,,
103,0.97,598.331,605.271,This is essentially a technical correction to the legislation that we passed in 2020.,12,,
104,0.97,605.271,607.173,We passed it two months after the pandemic began.,12,,
105,0.97,607.173,623.255,"In May of 2020 the Council adopted ordinance 126081, which required the tenants with unpaid rent from the pandemic be offered a repayment plan that lasted 3 to 6 months, depending on the amount of rental debt owed.",12,,
106,0.97,623.255,624.824,"Today is April 15th, 2022.",12,,
107,0.97,624.824,634.867,"If this were 2020, if we were in April of 2020, the pandemic would have started last month and we would have passed that bill next month.",12,,
108,0.97,634.867,638.971,At that time we believed the pandemic would only last two weeks.,12,,
109,0.97,638.971,640.74,Then we believed it would last two months.,12,,
110,0.97,640.74,644.81,We did not for see it lasting two years or more.,12,,
111,0.97,644.81,651.25,At that time everything was shut down and many people's line of work had froze.,12,,
112,0.97,651.25,660.626,"And we knew that people needed time to address the debt incurred during that closure, the initial part of the pandemic.",12,,
113,0.97,660.626,669.635,"A year later the following legislation, legislative session in April of 2021, the state passed similar payment legislation.",12,,
114,0.97,669.635,671.404,That's what we have before us.,12,,
115,0.97,671.404,675.875,They have the benefit to understand the pandemic.,12,,
116,0.97,675.875,679.211,It was going to last more than two weeks.,12,,
117,0.97,679.211,687.62,The reason I offer this modest bill as a technical correction is the legislation before you today is a mirror of our States legislation.,12,,
118,0.97,687.62,693.292,Requiring a reasonable repayment plan for debt incurred during the Covid-19 state of emergency.,12,,
119,0.97,693.292,695.194,I'm happy to answer any other questions.,12,,
120,0.97,695.194,696.595,I really appreciate Jeff's overview.,12,,
121,0.97,696.595,701.567,"Thank you, chair Sawant.",12,,
122,0.97,701.567,702.768,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",13,,
123,0.97,702.768,708.541,Two other committee members or Councilmembers want to say anything?,13,,
124,0.97,708.541,711.143,"Comments, questions?",13,,
125,0.97,711.143,716.649,I don't see anything and I believe we have had a good explanation of the bill.,13,,
126,0.97,716.649,717.616,"Thank you, Jeff.",13,,
127,0.97,717.616,721.654,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",13,,

199,0.97,1165.197,1172.738,My name is Timothy guy but Tim is just fine.,30,,
200,0.97,1172.738,1180.846,I applied for this position because I have been living in Seattle for so long as a Renter and I see myself continuing to be a Renter for many years now.,30,,

208,0.97,1219.785,1222.854,I use She/Her.,32,,
209,0.97,1222.854,1226.091,The bio did a really good job.,32,,
210,0.97,1226.091,1228.794,I was not prepared to hear all of that.,32,,
211,0.97,1228.794,1229.595,Thank you for preparing that.,32,,
212,0.97,1229.595,1240.472,The point that was included from that that I really want to hit on is my experience with transitional housing and being a current student at U Dub.,32,,
213,0.97,1240.472,1258.323,"Those were two unique experiences that I think are important and I hope to bring to the Commission, as well as a student perspective and what it's like to live.",32,,
214,0.97,1258.323,1264.162,This District area and any unique challenges that come with that.,32,,
215,0.97,1264.162,1265.13,Thank you.,32,,
216,0.97,1265.13,1268.367,"Thank you, Sarah.",33,,
217,0.97,1268.367,1271.336,Can we have Kim?,33,,
218,0.97,1271.336,1275.641,Absolutely and thank you.,34,,
219,0.97,1275.641,1284.816,As someone who has been a Renter more of her life than anything else I see affordable housing as crucial.,34,,
220,0.97,1284.816,1286.551,It's essential for any city.,34,,
221,0.97,1286.551,1296.662,"Especially Seattle, where incomes for summer taking off and for others are bottoming out.",34,,
222,0.97,1296.662,1309.541,I'm hoping to work on things that will increase the availability of affordable housing . Perhaps income based housing.,34,,
223,0.97,1309.541,1350.015,"I think my background as an attorney gives me some lens through which to view that . and also one of the emphases that I would like to work on is making sure the laws the Council passes have enforcement mechanisms in them so that Renters who are faced with difficult situations don't do then have to take on the further burden of finding an attorney or another person who can speak for them and help them, but instead can point to an article in the law that gives them the agency already.",34,,
224,0.97,1350.015,1354.753,"Anyhow, there's a lot of work and I'm eager to start.",34,,
225,0.97,1354.753,1356.121,Thank you for this opportunity.,34,,
226,0.97,1356.121,1359.191,"Thank you, Kim.",35,,
227,0.97,1359.191,1363.962,Now we have char.,35,,
228,0.97,1363.962,1364.363,Hello.,36,,
229,0.97,1364.363,1367.232,My name is char Smith.,36,,
230,0.97,1367.232,1378.977,As someone who deeply loves this city but has also had a lot of first-hand experience with it being very difficult to live here and move here.,36,,
231,0.97,1378.977,1383.582,Particularly for someone who is not having a roof over their head.,36,,
232,0.97,1383.582,1399.131,I'm just really excited to be able to work with everyone and I hope to help ensure that the voices of people who have lived outside and work Outsidewill be elevated.,36,,
233,0.97,1399.131,1400.665,They are our neighbors as well.,36,,
234,0.97,1400.665,1404.77,Thank you.,36,,
235,0.97,1404.77,1416.014,Thank you to all of you have been willing to serve on the Commission has been really active in its advocacy for Renters throughout the city.,37,,
236,0.97,1416.014,1424.756,"And also thank you, char, for mentioning the connection between the right of Renters and also our homeless neighbors.",37,,
237,0.97,1424.756,1427.726,There is a direct connection.,37,,
238,0.97,1427.726,1432.931,Obviously there is a complexity of reasons why a given individual might end up being homeless.,37,,
239,0.97,1432.931,1445.11,"The Conduit between on affordable housing as a Renter, and facing homelessness, is a very strong, statistically proven one.",37,,
240,0.97,1445.11,1451.85,We have studies that show that thus far everyone hundred dollar increase in the average rent we have a 15% rise in homelessness.,37,,
241,0.97,1451.85,1464.529,"That is a connection that was in a statistical study that covered many cities across the nation, including suburban areas.",37,,
242,0.97,1464.529,1469.668,I'm sure if you did a study like that just for Seattle you would probably find an even stronger link because the rents are skyrocketing.,37,,
243,0.97,1469.668,1477.209,"That now combined with the new inflation, another recession on the horizon, we already had the misery of the pandemic and loss of income.",37,,
244,0.97,1477.209,1482.347,Working people who are also Renters have just borne the brunt of it.,37,,
245,0.97,1482.347,1490.422,"You are all coming on the Commission, once the vote happens, at a time where the crisis has occurred.",37,,
246,0.97,1490.422,1493.959,But Renters really want to fight back.,37,,
247,0.97,1493.959,1505.77,I had a couple of questions for you but I can see Councilmember Nelson's hand up so I will go ahead and call on Councilmember Nelson.,37,,
248,0.97,1505.77,1507.239,"Go ahead, Councilmember Nelson.",37,,
249,0.97,1507.239,1521.119,First I want to say thank you to all of you to be willing to give your time and perspective and expertise to this Commission.,38,,
250,0.97,1521.119,1522.621,It's all volunteer and it's a big responsibility.,38,,
251,0.97,1522.621,1522.954,Thank you.,38,,
252,0.97,1522.954,1534.266,I want to follow up on something that Kim said about preserving affordable housing or making sure that there is affordable housing.,38,,
253,0.97,1534.266,1540.372,To me that means retaining the more affordable housing that is provided by small landlords.,38,,
254,0.97,1540.372,1561.96,"We lost about 14% of the registrants in the Rio survey, which basically looks at properties, inspects properties.",38,,
255,0.97,1561.96,1563.662,That is worrisome to me.,38,,
256,0.97,1563.662,1567.365,It means people are taking their units off the market for various reasons.,38,,
257,0.97,1567.365,1581.446,Figuring out ways to balance the needs of Renters and allowing the small landlords who generally don't rent at market rates from selling.,38,,
258,0.97,1581.446,1591.056,"Helping them stay in business so they don't sell so their properties are Redeveloped for market rates, which are Unaffordable for most people.",38,,
259,0.97,1591.056,1598.43,I hope that will be a consideration that you take to your work on the Commission.,38,,
260,0.97,1598.43,1606.638,Thank you.,38,,
261,0.97,1606.638,1616.615,Would any other Councilmembers like to make any points or are there any questions for the respective appointees?,39,,
262,0.97,1616.615,1626.825,I had a question to all of you.,39,,
263,0.97,1626.825,1637.469,We have obviously seen the crisis that we were talking about before.,39,,
264,0.97,1637.469,1645.577,"In terms of your work on the Renters Commission, are there specific policy agenda that you are thinking about?",39,,
265,0.97,1645.577,1654.819,I'm asking you not just in general but also in the context of a Renters Commission that has been very active and outspoken.,39,,
266,0.97,1654.819,1658.223,I really strongly appreciate that.,39,,
267,0.97,1658.223,1675.74,"For example, several of the policy victories that we had through my office and through Renter organizing were actually very strongly supported by the Renters Commission.",39,,
268,0.97,1675.74,1677.075,Some of them actually originated the recommendation.,39,,
269,0.97,1677.075,1679.577,Some of them originated from the Renters Commission.,39,,
270,0.97,1679.577,1687.419,"Also the six-month notice for Renters, before any rental fees can happen.",39,,
271,0.97,1687.419,1688.453,They would enroll in that.,39,,
272,0.97,1688.453,1700.765,What further developments do you believe we should be fighting for?,39,,
273,0.97,1700.765,1702.967,I will speak up.,40,,
274,0.97,1702.967,1706.304,Go ahead.,41,,
275,0.97,1706.304,1716.081,"One of the things that we have already been discussing, and we are going to be more specific once we Hone in on particular pieces of legislation.",42,,
276,0.97,1716.081,1721.419,Anti-Retaliation measures akin to those in civil rights laws.,42,,
277,0.97,1721.419,1731.262,"That will serve as a basis, sword and shield for Renters in the future.",42,,
278,0.97,1731.262,1747.612,After we heard from the Department of construction and inspection and realized how few people they have in this city to respond to the complaints of the spectrum of problems faced by tenants.,42,,
279,0.97,1747.612,1759.357,It becomes clear that there need to be more self enforcement and protections for Renters who do speak up.,42,,
280,0.97,1759.357,1766.464,Help may be a while in coming.,42,,
281,0.97,1766.464,1770.635,Just in need of perhaps a bigger stick.,42,,
282,0.97,1770.635,1775.306,That's what I will be advocating for.,42,,
283,0.97,1775.306,1776.141,"Thank you, Kim.",43,,
284,0.97,1776.141,1783.081,I really appreciate that and I completely agree that there shall be very strong Anti- retaliatory language.,43,,
285,0.97,1783.081,1786.985,We have that linkage for workers rights.,43,,
286,0.97,1786.985,1792.123,It's only as strong as its enforcement so we need to enforce those.,43,,
287,0.97,1792.123,1796.995,Also for tenants the starting point is having his laws in the books and we need to make sure those laws are enforced.,43,,
288,0.97,1796.995,1806.571,"Because, yes, landlocked intimidation against tenants speaking up is unfortunately not an unheard of occurrence.",43,,
289,0.97,1806.571,1808.273,Happens all the time.,43,,
290,0.97,1808.273,1812.677,Would any of the other appointees like to add anything?,43,,
291,0.97,1812.677,1814.345,"Char, go ahead.",43,,
292,0.97,1814.345,1816.214,Sure.,44,,
293,0.97,1816.214,1829.527,This was discussed in the early process . One thing that has come up for me as a Renter in Seattle is kind of what Kim spoke to.,44,,
294,0.97,1829.527,1844.075,The enforcement . but also I hear a lot of talk about we need to make sure mom and pop landlords are being helped out.,44,,
295,0.97,1844.075,1847.545,Certainly they need to be able to make sure they have a roof over their head.,44,,
296,0.97,1847.545,1855.753,"One of the things I have noticed is that our laws seem to give strong enforcement for larger entities, corporate entities, and tend to get a lot more relaxed.",44,,
297,0.97,1855.753,1867.365,I would say they are lenient when it comes to smaller operations.,44,,
298,0.97,1867.365,1879.944,Based on renting from mom and pop establishments in the city I would note that it is those areas where the enforcement is either divergent or different between larger rental companies.,44,,
299,0.97,1879.944,1888.219,"Those are areas where the latter will often time take advantage of Renters and really, really not live up to the spirit of the law, while adhering to the letter of it.",44,,
300,0.97,1888.219,1897.929,That is something I would like to hopefully see reviewed and look at.,44,,
301,0.97,1897.929,1900.064,Does anyone else want to add anything?,45,,
302,0.97,1900.064,1902.1,"Char, you brought up a very important point.",45,,
303,0.97,1902.1,1904.669,Do you go by char?,45,,
304,0.97,1904.669,1907.972,You got it.,46,,
305,0.97,1907.972,1910.141,I Deftly want to respond to that.,47,,
306,0.97,1910.141,1912.944,It's a very important point.,47,,
307,0.97,1912.944,1920.251,Tim or Sarah do you want to add anything?,47,,
308,0.97,1920.251,1939.304,"If I had to bring up anything I think one thing that strikes me, we often use the term, market rate, to discuss the price of rent in Seattle.",48,,
309,0.97,1939.304,1943.775,"Keeping up with market rate, which is not affordable.",48,,
310,0.97,1943.775,1964.128,"As someone who lives and works in the city I have had to constantly change employment because I saw my rent from 20 twin--2010, double.",48,,
311,0.97,1966.698,1970.501,If everything else is in keeping up with the market rate then how can rent manage to do that?,48,,
312,0.97,1970.501,1979.51,"Looking at policies regarding that, the moratorium we had on rental increase was a good thing in the past pandemic.",48,,
313,0.97,1979.51,1984.215,Or during the pandemic that we are still in.,48,,
314,0.97,1984.215,1987.819,What you think about rent control?,49,,
315,0.97,1987.819,1989.754,I think it's great.,50,,
316,0.97,1989.754,1998.329,I have a few relatives on the East Coast that have the benefit of that.,50,,
317,0.97,1998.329,2007.305,They are much more economically secure in their situations because of it.,50,,
318,0.97,2007.305,2011.142,"Sarah, would you like to add anything?",51,,
319,0.97,2011.142,2038.169,"Kind of my thoughts, I guess, for advocating for community owned forms of housing . threw the officials, agencies, departments, whatever, if they could support that and prop it up.",52,,
320,0.97,2038.169,2043.808,I'm thinking of the Weirdness that the housing cooperative is trying to start.,52,,
321,0.97,2043.808,2056.12,"How banks, even local, community focused banks on the fact that there are blanket and shared loans and things like that.",52,,
322,0.97,2056.12,2061.859,If cities could do anything to help.,52,,
323,0.97,2061.859,2065.93,They can make more of a culture to support that were propped that up themselves.,52,,
324,0.97,2065.93,2076.007,And any other kind of smaller loan agencies if people wanted to do that with their own big houses and stuff like that.,52,,
325,0.97,2076.007,2089.954,I guess I'm kind of thinking about advocating for the ownership community in housing.,52,,
326,0.97,2089.954,2092.223,"All of you, I appreciate the points you brought up.",53,,
327,0.97,2092.223,2093.057,They are extremely valuable.,53,,
328,0.97,2093.057,2102.834,I could not agree more with what you all have said in terms of your recommendations and what needs to change.,53,,
329,0.97,2102.834,2109.34,Obviously we need to keep working on strengthening the Renters rights law in many different ways.,53,,
330,0.97,2109.34,2121.219,"I hope you all know the kinds of laws we were able to initiate through the work of Renter organizing, through my office and the Union is part of it.",53,,
331,0.97,2121.219,2123.054,We won a whole series of victories last year.,53,,
332,0.97,2123.054,2132.263,We need to win more this year and the crisis is acute for helping people.,53,,
333,0.97,2132.263,2148.179,"In addition to all those things that we are doing, including the six-month notice, the Emma economic Eviction assistance, three months rent when they end up displacing a tenant, you do an exorbitant rent increase.",53,,
334,0.97,2148.179,2159.423,In addition to all of that we need to the Overarching policy or changes that would actually make a decisive shift in the misery that Renters face and many of you have talked about this.,53,,
335,0.97,2159.423,2162.226,Sarah talked about the crisis for students.,53,,
336,0.97,2162.226,2166.03,Working people are being forced to move.,53,,
337,0.97,2166.03,2170.301,Their income is not keeping up with the skyrocketing rent.,53,,
338,0.97,2170.301,2174.438,All of this absolutely needs citywide rent control.,53,,
339,0.97,2174.438,2185.716,"I would appeal to you all, if you all could look at the rent control legislation that my office has drafted.",53,,
340,0.97,2185.716,2186.918,We would love your feedback.,53,,
341,0.97,2186.918,2205.469,"Just in a nutshell, what that bill does is it will go into effect as soon as the state lifted its completely unjust more than 40-year-old man on rent control for cities to pass rent control.",53,,
342,0.97,2205.469,2209.574,If the band were lifted then the rent control that we are recommending is extremely strong.,53,,
343,0.97,2209.574,2219.684,"Basically it says that every rental home, no matter what it is, if you're renting in a group house or Condo, or as Sarah mentioned, student housing.",53,,
344,0.97,2219.684,2229.193,"If your a student and you are renting in student housing, it doesn't matter what type of rental home it is.",53,,
345,0.97,2229.193,2231.629,You should be covered under rent control and there should be vacancy control.,53,,
346,0.97,2231.629,2244.108,Meaning it should not be allowed to go up dramatically again and it should remain under rent control regardless of tenants moving in and out.,53,,
347,0.97,2244.108,2247.778,"It should be citywide and it should cover all buildings, regardless of when the buildings were built.",53,,
348,0.97,2247.778,2267.598,"As I'm sure you all know, because you have expertise on Renters rights, you know that in other cities where they have rent control the corporate to landlord lobby ended up fighting against it and they have introduced loopholes of variance kinds that makes the rent control function not well.",53,,
349,0.97,2267.598,2272.536,They use those loopholes to say that it doesn't work and say it does not cover all Renters so it needs to be abolished.,53,,
350,0.97,2272.536,2287.618,"But what we have seen is even with those weaknesses, having rent control in these crucial cities has proven to be an absolute lifeline for a lot of working people.",53,,
351,0.97,2287.618,2290.054,We need that in Seattle because it is getting unlivable.,53,,
352,0.97,2290.054,2291.956,The rents are Unaffordable.,53,,
353,0.97,2291.956,2306.671,"I know char brought up a very, very important point about how there is this whole idea created.",53,,
354,0.97,2306.671,2310.541,"Mom and pop landlords, we should be protecting mom and pop landlords, as if that's a goal in itself.",53,,
355,0.97,2310.541,2313.711,The goal is to make life livable for the vast majority of people.,53,,
356,0.97,2313.711,2319.517,By that measure nobody should be allowed to exploit anyone else.,53,,
357,0.97,2319.517,2322.887,"Whether you are a small business or your Amazon, you should not be explaining her employees.",53,,
358,0.97,2322.887,2324.021,Similarly with small landlords and big landlords.,53,,
359,0.97,2324.021,2327.491,You should not be allowed to exploit Renters.,53,,
360,0.97,2327.491,2330.327,"I really appreciate, char, the point you brought up.",53,,
361,0.97,2330.327,2333.431,The law should be enforced no matter which landlords are doing it.,53,,
362,0.97,2333.431,2337.735,It's a very important point.,53,,
363,0.97,2337.735,2338.936,There are good landlords.,53,,
364,0.97,2338.936,2355.686,"But we cannot have laws that rely on some people doing good things, whereas the norm for Renters, being that they are being exploited, I would really recommend if people have not read the book by Matthew Desmond, it is called evicted.",53,,
365,0.97,2355.686,2356.721,Poverty in the American city.,53,,
366,0.97,2356.721,2371.435,"It is a brilliant exposition of how there are so many landlords, including small landlords, who whether or not--they end up playing this role in the rental market.",53,,
367,0.97,2371.435,2383.013,Just absolutely devastating and exploiting Renters.,53,,
368,0.97,2383.714,2388.986,"That's why the laws have to be written in such a way, and enforced in such a way that they protect Renters that are being exploited.",53,,
369,0.97,2388.986,2397.595,Furthermore there is also the problem that a lot of Slumlords and big corporations divide themselves into small Llcs where the individual company might be small but overall it is actually a massive corporation that is exploiting Renters.,53,,
370,0.97,2397.595,2409.84,I think all of that needs to be taken into consideration . My office has repeatedly made those points that we need to keep that into account.,53,,
371,0.97,2409.84,2416.781,"One less thing, unless there are any further questions, is in response to what Councilmember Nelson said.",53,,
372,0.97,2416.781,2443.24,"There is this repeated assertion that is being made by the landlord lobby that small landlords are leaving the housing market and the implication, although it is not said explicitly, the language is that Renters rights are driving small landlords out of the market and that's why we need to give consideration for landlords.",53,,
373,0.97,2443.24,2444.175,I want to be very clear.,53,,
374,0.97,2444.175,2447.311,I have said this before but I will say it again in this Committee.,53,,
375,0.97,2447.311,2454.819,"The data has been totally misrepresented to make that claim . First, the data they are using is rental inspection registrations, which landlords Culd skip during the pandemic.",53,,
376,0.97,2454.819,2457.288,So there might not even be a reduction in small landlords.,53,,
377,0.97,2457.288,2457.888,It's not clear.,53,,
378,0.97,2457.888,2458.722,The numbers are not reliable.,53,,
379,0.97,2458.722,2462.426,I would not be surprised if small landlords were selling because property values are going through the roof.,53,,
380,0.97,2462.426,2463.36,Property values are skyrocketing.,53,,
381,0.97,2463.36,2475.539,All landlords are selling because they do not want to comply with the law or they are selling because property values have gone through the roof and they can cash in on their property like never before.,53,,
382,0.97,2475.539,2477.041,All of that needs to be examined.,53,,
383,0.97,2477.041,2479.543,"If it's going to be data driven, let's actually be data driven.",53,,
384,0.97,2479.543,2482.213,We also have to have a reality check from the perspective of Renters.,53,,
385,0.97,2482.213,2488.452,It does not make much difference whom you pay your rent check to.,53,,
386,0.97,2488.452,2495.159,"If a landlord is not willing to respect the Renters rights and sells a property as a result, they probably should not have been a landlord anyway.",53,,
387,0.97,2495.159,2506.17,"The bottom line is, if you're a landlord who is not explaining the Renters, your tenants, then the laws do not even affect you.",53,,
388,0.97,2506.17,2509.673,Rent control would not affect you as a landlord if you're not gouging your tenants with high rent.,53,,
389,0.97,2509.673,2514.879,If you're good landlord then you should actually be supporting.,53,,
390,0.97,2514.879,2517.047,And we do have good landlords who do support Renters rights.,53,,
391,0.97,2517.047,2523.12,Some of them have spoken up in public comment as well.,53,,
392,0.97,2523.12,2529.727,I'm happy with the appointees.,53,,
393,0.97,2529.727,2532.229,I can see Councilmember Nelson has raised her hand again.,53,,
394,0.97,2532.229,2540.104,Please go ahead.,53,,
395,0.97,2540.104,2545.276,"Councilmember Nelson, you are muted.",54,,
396,0.97,2545.276,2547.111,I hate it when I do that.,55,,
397,0.97,2547.111,2552.182,"I was just saying that you are absolutely right, Councilmember Sawant.",55,,
398,0.97,2552.182,2554.618,It is important.,55,,
399,0.97,2554.618,2568.933,"The best data we have right now Unfortunately is the 2018 study, which includes interviews from landlords and tenants.",55,,
400,0.97,2568.933,2571.535,Both sides talk about their struggles.,55,,
401,0.97,2571.535,2578.075,The reasons that many small landlords are struggling are talked about there.,55,,
402,0.97,2578.075,2579.176,The top reasons.,55,,
403,0.97,2579.176,2587.017,It's not simply because they can make a lot more money selling their properties.,55,,
404,0.97,2587.017,2594.325,They do go into specifics about the things they are concerned about.,55,,
405,0.97,2594.325,2594.592,Right.,56,,
406,0.97,2594.592,2598.395,Okay.,56,,
407,0.97,2598.395,2619.483,"We will go ahead and have the vote . I will move appointment 02180, appointment 02181, is 0183, 02184.",56,,
408,0.97,2619.483,2622.319,Will you please call the role?,56,,
409,0.97,2622.319,2626.857,Councilmember Sawant.,57,,

416,0.97,2640.004,2642.206,Yes.,64,,
417,0.97,2642.206,2651.815,"All appointees, your appointments have been recommended now by the committee and will go on to the city council agenda.",65,,
418,0.97,2651.815,2654.852,"I'm being told again on Tuesday, April 26th.",65,,
419,0.97,2654.852,2662.026,If they are going to be next week right away then we will of course let you know for the Presenters and appointees.,65,,
420,0.97,2662.026,2669.533,There's not going to be a panel like this in the full city council meeting so you are not expected to attend on the 26th.,65,,
421,0.97,2669.533,2673.203,We look forward to your work on the Renters Commission.,65,,
422,0.97,2673.203,2675.172,Please be in touch with my office.,65,,
423,0.97,2675.172,2678.542,Thank you so much.,65,,
424,0.97,2678.542,2678.842,Okay.,65,,
425,0.97,2678.842,2692.823,"We have our last item today that will be a hearing from Renters, the tenant of the apartments.",65,,
426,0.97,2692.823,2699.763,I really appreciate your time in being available to talk to the committee at such short notice and I apologize you had to wait.,65,,
427,0.97,2699.763,2706.904,This is something that is happening to Renters all over the city.,65,,
428,0.97,2706.904,2707.971,Hopefully we can save your homes.,65,,
429,0.97,2707.971,2710.574,And other Renters around the city can be inspired by your example.,65,,
430,0.97,2710.574,2716.08,"And like you, will get organized into Renters associations.",65,,
431,0.97,2716.08,2722.753,Please tell us a little bit about your situation.,65,,
432,0.97,2722.753,2729.159,I personally think that Liz should go first.,66,,
433,0.97,2729.159,2731.962,She is the person that lit the fire for the group.,66,,
434,0.97,2731.962,2733.997,Okay.,67,,
435,0.97,2733.997,2737.935,I can do that.,67,,
436,0.97,2737.935,2742.639,I was just Texting with another tenant who hopes to join us.,67,,

439,0.97,2746.51,2754.284,I have written a little statement.,67,,
440,0.97,2754.284,2758.388,Thank you so much for having us here today and for taking the time to listen to us.,67,,
441,0.97,2758.388,2762.693,I feel that is very important and I appreciate it more than you know.,67,,
442,0.97,2762.693,2772.503,I have been a resident of the Madkin apartments for six years.,67,,
443,0.97,2772.503,2774.905,"Was born in Capitol Hill, raised up in Lake city and back.",67,,
444,0.97,2774.905,2775.939,It has been wonderful.,67,,
445,0.97,2775.939,2791.054,"Having grown up here and be in rented units for many years, I have seen changes in the city, including how Unaffordable it has become for all of us.",67,,
446,0.97,2791.054,2792.289,I also work for Uw Madison.,67,,
447,0.97,2792.289,2794.191,I have worked for them for over 20 years.,67,,
448,0.97,2794.191,2796.76,I make more than I ever thought I would make.,67,,
449,0.97,2796.76,2807.571,I still qualify for low income housing because the area has become so expensive and it is very difficult to find housing.,67,,
450,0.97,2807.571,2815.746,That is kind of the situation we will be finding ourselves in if we don't get help.,67,,
451,0.97,2815.746,2822.085,"I had the privilege of being related to the previous owner, and the current owners.",67,,
452,0.97,2822.085,2827.357,I was very proud of the fact he kept the rent below market rate.,67,,
453,0.97,2827.357,2845.309,It's unobtainable for so many people . I hear from my friends who are renting that their rents would go up every year like clockwork and they would have to move every couple of years to try to find a place that was affordable.,67,,
454,0.97,2845.309,2848.979,Whereas we would go years between increases.,67,,
455,0.97,2848.979,2850.614,We have a beautiful community here.,67,,
456,0.97,2850.614,2854.318,I'm a bit of an Introvert.,67,,
457,0.97,2854.318,2861.625,I wasn't as Chummy with my neighbors until the situation called for it.,67,,
458,0.97,2861.625,2866.997,But I'm finding out we have caring people.,67,,
459,0.97,2866.997,2872.236,We have artists.,67,,
460,0.97,2872.236,2875.906,I heard that there were some musicians that recently moved out.,67,,
461,0.97,2875.906,2894.725,"We are a vibrant community and Councilmember Sawant, you mentioned that landlords are starting to sell because of their land being worth a lot.",67,,
462,0.97,2894.725,2899.429,Since this building will be sold my fear is that it will be sold to a predatory developer.,67,,
463,0.97,2899.429,2902.432,They would be able to offer the most.,67,,
464,0.97,2902.432,2907.137,Money talks.,67,,
465,0.97,2907.137,2916.98,Not only is this community of Renters worth saving but also the building itself . It was built in 1904.,67,,
466,0.97,2916.98,2920.05,I have a real iron Murphy bed from that time in my closet that works.,67,,
467,0.97,2920.05,2924.187,It's just an amazing piece of architecture.,67,,
468,0.97,2924.187,2930.26,My love for this building and this area is deep.,67,,
469,0.97,2930.26,2933.397,I belong to the Co-op next-door.,67,,
470,0.97,2933.397,2940.904,I could walk most places I need to go to get to work.,67,,

472,0.97,2944.942,2953.55,Thank you.,67,,
473,0.97,2953.55,2956.553,I can speak a little bit about my experience.,68,,

475,0.97,2959.456,2961.892,"Thanks, first of all, for hearing our story.",68,,
476,0.97,2961.892,2970.867,I have been a resident at the Madkin apartments for many years.,68,,
477,0.97,2970.867,2981.078,"My friend and previous roommate described the building to me before I had seen it as a charming building with a lot of character, and a Quirky way.",68,,
478,0.97,2981.078,2983.146,Which is evident as soon as you walk into the building.,68,,
479,0.97,2983.146,2987.718,You don't need to know any history about the building to feel that the building has a lot of history.,68,,
480,0.97,2987.718,3005.802,"Dark wood floors, a banister that complements it by its deep red carpet that leads up the stairs to my apartment where you would find things like a Nonfunctioning icebox, that speaks back to the Pre- refrigerator days.",68,,
481,0.97,3005.802,3011.141,Or there is a waiter shaft that leads down to other apartments.,68,,
482,0.97,3011.141,3024.755,"There is a Walk-In closet off of the living room where you find these painted over windows, that if you opened would just face the other painted windows in my bathroom over this nice Clawfoot tub.",68,,
483,0.97,3024.755,3032.562,It's really unique . The rent is better than anything you could find in the neighborhood.,68,,
484,0.97,3032.562,3036.233,Both when I moved in and currently.,68,,
485,0.97,3036.233,3041.872,When I moved in I had a nice view of the Olympic mountain range from the bedroom.,68,,
486,0.97,3041.872,3044.775,It was the perfect home.,68,,
487,0.97,3044.775,3051.515,Also I have been struck by the community that is in the building.,68,,
488,0.97,3051.515,3053.717,People stopped to talk to one another in the hallways.,68,,
489,0.97,3053.717,3055.552,"They help each other out, they support one another.",68,,
490,0.97,3055.552,3068.498,"I remember coming home one day to a power outage to find Hour- long term resident, Jack, walking the hallways with a flashlight and making sure everyone was safe.",68,,
491,0.97,3068.498,3080.677,"My neighbor, Marianne, I saw her across Madison just cleaning up around the bus stop just because she cares about the community.",68,,
492,0.97,3080.677,3085.715,"We have a shared laundry room that has served as a free room where you can leave things like small appliances, art, and books.",68,,
493,0.97,3085.715,3109.072,"Furniture . During the past 14 walks to and from goodwill, where I have worked all this time, I have watched one house after another get knocked down to make way for a tall, hastily built shipping container apartment.",68,,
494,0.97,3109.072,3115.445,The view of the mountains that I once had is now in view of newer and Shinier apartments and office buildings.,68,,

496,0.97,3124.654,3126.456,That is currently where I'm at.,68,,
497,0.97,3126.456,3139.736,Through the and Denver I have had the opportunity to stay around many buildings in Capitol Hill in Seattle.,68,,
498,0.97,3139.736,3145.909,"More and more frequently they turn out to feel like a replication of the last soulless building that I was in, where you need a key FOB to get in.",68,,
499,0.97,3145.909,3155.552,"I like using a brass key to get into my building, which seems to be going away these days.",68,,
500,0.97,3155.552,3158.822,"I feel very, very lucky to have spent the time that I have in the building.",68,,
501,0.97,3158.822,3161.057,It's the longest I have ever lived in one place.,68,,
502,0.97,3161.057,3164.294,It has felt more like a home to me than any other place I have lived.,68,,
503,0.97,3164.294,3168.198,I don't know what the future holds for the building or where I might be in a year or two.,68,,
504,0.97,3168.198,3182.546,I feel that I owe it to the building that I have called home for the past decade and a half to do anything that I can to help protect it from becoming the next casualty of hedge fund agreed and a rapidly changing demographic.,68,,
505,0.97,3182.546,3185.982,I think the neighborhood deserves better than that.,68,,

515,0.97,3225.055,3234.898,I will have lived in the Madkin apartments for 13 years as of this November.,69,,
516,0.97,3234.898,3239.169,It's relatively low rent and has infrequent rent increases.,69,,
517,0.97,3239.169,3254.284,I live in a building with many of my friends as neighbors and I have been Freelancing and video Postproduction for 10 years.,69,,
518,0.97,3254.284,3255.118,My income tends to vary.,69,,
519,0.97,3255.118,3261.224,I do the majority of my work at home but being located here at home allows me the flexibility to use public transit to get On- site work when needed.,69,,
520,0.97,3261.224,3265.161,"When the pandemic hit my roommate moved out as a precaution, as people were starting to quarantine and Lockdown.",69,,
521,0.97,3265.161,3270.8,Thankfully my rent was low enough and I had enough income that I could take on the extra cost.,69,,
522,0.97,3270.8,3275.505,I know many other people were not as lucky.,69,,
523,0.97,3275.505,3277.741,I want to do what I can to preserve this building.,69,,
524,0.97,3277.741,3292.122,"Not only as an affordable living option that--far too many luxury apartments . but also as a possible civil rights historic landmark, as suggested by the rapid transit assessment.",69,,
525,0.97,3292.122,3298.395,Thank you.,69,,
526,0.97,3298.395,3309.439,Thanks to the committee today for making time to hear from some of your voters.,70,,

528,0.97,3312.676,3319.049,My pronouns are She/Her.,70,,
529,0.97,3319.049,3327.49,This building sits at a really incredible intersection . It sits at the intersection of Capitol Hill and the central district.,70,,
530,0.97,3327.49,3335.965,"That connects it to an illustrious history . civil rights issues, labor union work, and black Seattle.",70,,
531,0.97,3335.965,3340.737,Which is rapidly vanishing.,70,,
532,0.97,3340.737,3348.111,But it also sits at a very interesting intersection of history in terms of the people who have passed through this building.,70,,
533,0.97,3348.111,3351.581,"We have had writers, artists, amazing people.",70,,
534,0.97,3351.581,3358.555,We have a Grammy award winning musician that lives in our basement.,70,,
535,0.97,3358.555,3360.757,He lives here because he cannot afford to live anywhere else.,70,,
536,0.97,3360.757,3369.132,If that doesn't say something that I don't know what does.,70,,
537,0.97,3369.132,3370.734,"My story, quickly, I was raised in poverty.",70,,
538,0.97,3370.734,3378.041,I experienced a lot of housing instability through my whole childhood.,70,,
539,0.97,3378.041,3386.116,I also have lived here the longest of any place I have lived in my life.,70,,
540,0.97,3386.116,3387.55,I have been here for 12 years.,70,,
541,0.97,3387.55,3390.854,I moved here also because friends were in the building.,70,,
542,0.97,3390.854,3402.499,Through the pandemic that has been an incredible psychological and emotional resource . knowing that I had friends who felt like family just down the hall.,70,,
543,0.97,3402.499,3411.307,We could pod together and keep ourselves sane through this incredibly wild time that the civilization is living through.,70,,
544,0.97,3411.307,3423.119,The building itself is such an old one with a lot of character and Sass.,70,,
545,0.97,3423.119,3428.091,"Somebody that was in our group at the meeting on Wednesday said, if it was possible it feels like this building loves you back.",70,,
546,0.97,3428.091,3431.461,It feels like this building holds you.,70,,
547,0.97,3431.461,3437.233,I think that this building was built with a mission.,70,,
548,0.97,3437.233,3439.636,I think that it still fulfills this mission.,70,,
549,0.97,3439.636,3444.874,That mission is offering real homes in the middle of the city.,70,,
550,0.97,3444.874,3450.28,Not Shoebox shipping containers that people can survive in.,70,,
551,0.97,3450.28,3455.351,But spaces that people can actually live and thrive in.,70,,
552,0.97,3455.351,3465.662,"We can work from home, we can pursue hobbies, we can host guests in our home.",70,,
553,0.97,3465.662,3474.704,"We can, ostensibly, live in our home and have full lives in these homes and experience the benefits of stability and long- term tenancy.",70,,
554,0.97,3474.704,3492.322,"As one of the other folks who was here earlier mentioned, as the rent has increased, having to move every year, every two years, you'll have the opportunity to build something in your life if you are constantly Destabilized.",70,,
555,0.97,3492.322,3495.458,"The spaces in this building allow people to raise families, pursue hobbies, host guests.",70,,
556,0.97,3495.458,3501.931,"Again, right here in the middle of the city.",70,,
557,0.97,3501.931,3507.036,"This, to me, speaks to the deepest point of all of this.",70,,
558,0.97,3507.036,3509.772,People shouldn't have to be rich or famous to survive in Seattle.,70,,
559,0.97,3509.772,3528.925,"People shouldn't have to be connected to some illustrious history or some magical pot of gold to be able to pursue a full life in the middle of this city that supposedly supports artists, creative, and Progressives.",70,,
560,0.97,3528.925,3531.16,Yet we are being chased out hand over foot.,70,,
561,0.97,3531.16,3538.568,"A long time ago there was a bill that said, the last people to leave Seattle please turn out the lights.",70,,
562,0.97,3538.568,3539.969,I would like to keep them on.,70,,
563,0.97,3539.969,3541.804,I would like to keep the lights on.,70,,
564,0.97,3541.804,3545.475,I would like to stay in Seattle.,70,,
565,0.97,3545.475,3558.788,"I think that people like us, and experience like this, speaks to the heart of the previous owner, Sally, not raising rent.",70,,
566,0.97,3558.788,3564.661,And the building owner himself creating homes here in the heart of the city of Seattle where people can truly pursue full lives.,70,,
567,0.97,3564.661,3572.869,"Thanks again, guys.",70,,
568,0.97,3572.869,3574.37,I guess I can go next.,71,,
569,0.97,3574.37,3581.678,"When Liz was speaking she mentioned that our neighbor was trying to connect, and she couldn't.",71,,
570,0.97,3581.678,3589.786,I pretty much knew who she was talking about so I ran down the hall to see Marianne.,71,,
571,0.97,3589.786,3597.594,I think that is a Testament to the type of neighbors we have here at the Madkin apartments.,71,,
572,0.97,3597.594,3601.264,I have some points I would like to bring up.,71,,
573,0.97,3601.264,3605.134,Some of my neighbors did a great job.,71,,
574,0.97,3605.134,3614.11,But like my neighbors I am really concerned with the prospect of this building being sold to developers will disrupt our Long-Standing home.,71,,
575,0.97,3614.11,3619.649,I have personally lived here for just over a decade.,71,,
576,0.97,3619.649,3628.091,"While our building has not had a lot of turnover, everyone has been here . When I moved in people had been here a lot longer than I had.",71,,
577,0.97,3628.091,3638.067,"During that time that I have been here, I have seen long- standing institutions, both homes and businesses, destroyed and replaced.",71,,
578,0.97,3638.067,3638.835,What has replaced them?,71,,
579,0.97,3638.835,3643.506,It has really erased some of the culture of the neighborhood that I initially loved.,71,,
580,0.97,3643.506,3646.976,It's what drew me here.,71,,
581,0.97,3646.976,3655.718,"I have concerns . I'm sorry, I'm consulting my notes.",71,,
582,0.97,3655.718,3673.102,"Recently, when he got the notice that the building was possibly going to be put on the market, I looked around at what other apartments in this neighborhood were going for.",71,,
583,0.97,3673.102,3676.806,"Then I looked outside of this neighborhood, around the city.",71,,
584,0.97,3676.806,3680.043,The rents were no less than triple what I currently pay.,71,,
585,0.97,3680.043,3692.889,"If I were to be displaced or my neighbors to be displaced, I'm afraid of what would happen to them and what would happen to me.",71,,
586,0.97,3692.889,3702.865,I think anything that would be put in this place would not be constructed with people like us in mind.,71,,
587,0.97,3702.865,3706.135,Do you have anything to say before we relinquish?,71,,
588,0.97,3706.135,3706.903,Yes.,72,,
589,0.97,3706.903,3710.106,I Marianne.,72,,

594,0.97,3726.355,3728.191,I'm not kicked off to the side.,72,,
595,0.97,3728.191,3735.098,As you can see my neighbors hel me at every phase that I have gone through.,72,,

601,0.97,3761.924,3768.731,It's pretty amazing what happens.,72,,

613,0.97,3817.747,3824.854,What I learned is you could wake up and your neighbors would be evicted and you would never see them again.,74,,
614,0.97,3824.854,3827.924,"What I learned is if you love somebody, say it now.",74,,
615,0.97,3827.924,3830.793,And let it come out now.,74,,

682,0.97,4182.545,4184.146,That gives them the courage.,78,,
683,0.97,4184.146,4193.522,I think sharing it in a community actually helps to heal because it allows people into your life to help you do that.,78,,
684,0.97,4193.522,4204.3,"Your point was well taken about how during all of that crisis, and I can only imagine the pain of losing your children, even for a short while.",78,,
685,0.97,4204.3,4214.61,"I hope you know that I really, truly feel compassion for how you have gone through all of this.",78,,
686,0.97,4214.61,4230.125,"But the point that your fellow tenants for the help that you needed in those really, really crucial moments, I think all of this is just remarkable.",78,,
687,0.97,4230.125,4233.596,"The fact that you all, many of you have lived there for over a decade.",78,,
688,0.97,4233.596,4237.866,You all have already said it.,78,,
689,0.97,4237.866,4240.135,It's almost unheard of.,78,,
690,0.97,4240.135,4253.749,"The thing that I was reminded of immediately was we had a press conference last September to unveil our rent control legislation, which I urge you all to look at as well.",78,,
691,0.97,4253.749,4259.989,We had a Speaker who was a Doctoral student at the University of Washington.,78,,
692,0.97,4259.989,4263.292,"He said, ever since I moved to Seattle I have moved every year.",78,,
693,0.97,4263.292,4268.163,"Like clockwork, I have moved every year.",78,,
694,0.97,4268.163,4287.016,"Also the fact that Renters are forced to move so frequently, it actually allows the system to put us even further to a race to the bottom.",78,,
695,0.97,4287.016,4289.284,When we are all isolated and Atomized we cannot fight back.,78,,
696,0.97,4289.284,4301.73,"It's only when you come together, as you all have as tenants, as organized tenants or organized workers, like Starbucks and Amazon workers, it's only when we come together and Pushback against the isolation that we are able to achieve something.",78,,
697,0.97,4301.73,4303.332,Otherwise the system just grinds you down.,78,,
698,0.97,4303.332,4311.94,That is itself a Testament to why we should absolutely be saving your tenancy in this building.,78,,
699,0.97,4311.94,4319.248,"I wanted to show you, from my office, as you know, we would absolutely be on your side.",78,,
700,0.97,4319.248,4332.161,We would really fight to make sure that a nonprofit organization can buy the building . You're all setting up your tenant Union or organization is the first step for that.,78,,
701,0.97,4332.161,4336.498,Thank you again.,78,,
702,0.97,4336.498,4343.439,"We have Councilmember Nelson with a question or comment and then, Ted, you should also share what you learned at the meeting.",78,,
703,0.97,4343.439,4348.277,"Go ahead, Councilmember.",78,,
704,0.97,4348.277,4351.78,Thank you all for talking about your experience.,79,,
705,0.97,4351.78,4352.381,It's heartwarming to hear.,79,,
706,0.97,4352.381,4354.216,It reminds me of that show.,79,,
707,0.97,4354.216,4356.819,I'm going to date myself now.,79,,
708,0.97,4356.819,4359.922,Tales of the city.,79,,
709,0.97,4359.922,4370.332,All of the Oddballs in that house . I still remember the story.,79,,
710,0.97,4370.332,4372.234,A building and a community worth saving.,79,,
711,0.97,4372.234,4373.235,"To Marianne, congratulations.",79,,
712,0.97,4373.235,4377.706,I've only got 18 months sober.,79,,
713,0.97,4377.706,4385.848,I know how important community is.,79,,
714,0.97,4385.848,4387.916,Maybe you touched on it but I didn't hear it.,79,,
715,0.97,4387.916,4404.967,Has anybody talked to the owner or the manager to find out why they are selling it?,79,,
716,0.97,4404.967,4409.271,I don't know very much.,80,,
717,0.97,4409.271,4415.611,I wouldn't feel comfortable saying what I do know.,80,,
718,0.97,4415.611,4421.25,It is now owned by my three aunts.,80,,
719,0.97,4421.25,4423.152,I do respect their decisions.,80,,
720,0.97,4423.152,4429.892,I wanted to try to be respectful of that.,80,,
721,0.97,4429.892,4436.331,All I know is that they have decided to sell.,80,,
722,0.97,4436.331,4436.565,Sorry.,80,,
723,0.97,4436.565,4439.201,No deeper insight.,80,,
724,0.97,4439.201,4448.21,"Asking, why, is Maybe the first way to figure it out.",81,,
725,0.97,4448.21,4449.411,Thanks.,81,,
726,0.97,4449.411,4455.551,"Ted, go ahead.",82,,
727,0.97,4455.551,4457.619,Details related to the.,83,,
728,0.97,4457.619,4476.271,"The previous owner, who was acting as the landlord, passed away.",83,,
729,0.97,4476.939,4478.74,The heirs do not intend to play that role.,83,,
730,0.97,4478.74,4490.586,That's the thing that happened that has caused this situation right now.,83,,
731,0.97,4490.586,4506.335,"I think the points that came up your were the points that were also discussed at the excellent meeting organized by the tenants Union on Wednesday, which I was able to attend.",83,,
732,0.97,4506.335,4520.415,I'm glad to be able to do that because it is really oppressive how this is organized into a tenants Association.,83,,
733,0.97,4520.415,4527.789,There is no way to fight if you do not first get organized.,83,,
734,0.97,4527.789,4528.423,That happened really fast.,83,,
735,0.97,4528.423,4530.792,I don't think I've seen it happen this fast.,83,,
736,0.97,4530.792,4541.403,"It's a real Testament to how people have lived in this building for so long, and have a community.",83,,
737,0.97,4541.403,4553.715,"Which also, as Councilmember Sawant mentioned, when rents are not raised through the roof and people are not evicted by rent increases.",83,,
738,0.97,4553.715,4554.983,They can form a community.,83,,
739,0.97,4554.983,4560.122,Controlling rent is good for all of society.,83,,
740,0.97,4560.122,4562.124,That is in danger now.,83,,
741,0.97,4562.124,4569.498,"One of the things that was mentioned, discussed at the meeting, was finding a nonprofit.",83,,
742,0.97,4569.498,4576.805,There is a representative from Lehigh at the meeting.,83,,
743,0.97,4576.805,4585.881,There are different nonprofit housing providers like that.,83,,
744,0.97,4585.881,4600.762,"If there is an organized effort to put pressure on the state or city to fund something, it's possible to save this sort of housing for the people that live there.",83,,
745,0.97,4600.762,4613.241,"If that happens then the rent will not be raised through the roof, which is going to be absolutely crucial.",83,,
746,0.97,4613.241,4620.749,The Renters here today formed an association to advocate for that.,83,,
747,0.97,4620.749,4631.093,"Thank you, Ted.",84,,
748,0.97,4634.162,4636.365,We will of course be in touch with all of the tenants.,84,,
749,0.97,4636.365,4647.009,My office will be in touch with you all.,84,,
750,0.97,4647.009,4654.349,"The best thing would be if the building is bought, there is an ability for a nonprofit organization to buy the building so that the rents can remain affordable.",84,,
751,0.97,4654.349,4659.221,"In terms of the question of why the current owners are selling, I don't know either.",84,,
752,0.97,4659.221,4661.156,We don't know.,84,,
753,0.97,4661.156,4673.435,"I'm sure it has something to do with the fact that, right now, it's a really good time to get a huge value on the land.",84,,
754,0.97,4673.435,4679.307,We cannot allow the lives of the tenants of the building to be Upended because some person needs to make their personal decision.,84,,
755,0.97,4679.307,4686.281,Which is why my office is also a very strong advocate for an expansion of social housing.,84,,
756,0.97,4686.281,4697.926,"Taxing big business and the wealthy to create the funds to build a publicly owned housing that is affordable, because it is publicly owned.",84,,
757,0.97,4697.926,4699.694,Also we need rent control as well.,84,,
758,0.97,4699.694,4720.382,We both rent control to be sure that rental homes that are owned by private corporations exploit Renters . Dlords don't it cannot be the whim of some private owner either.,84,,
759,0.97,4720.382,4721.216,That's what we need.,84,,
760,0.97,4721.216,4734.062,The fact that you guys are developing a tenants Association is important.,84,,
761,0.97,4734.062,4742.07,My office has been very engaged in the fight for tenants at Baker.,84,,
762,0.97,4742.07,4754.95,It's a big complex with over 500 tenants that is owned by a nonprofit corporation that has funding.,84,,
763,0.97,4754.95,4756.284,The conditions are absolutely deplorable.,84,,
764,0.97,4756.284,4765.827,"In other words, tenant organizing is going to be crucial no matter who your owner is because you need to be organized for different kinds of rights.",84,,
765,0.97,4765.827,4768.096,Right now we are fighting to maintain the tenancy there.,84,,
766,0.97,4768.096,4776.671,"But how much rent goes up, what the conditions are, all of that needs to be in the tenants' hands.",84,,
767,0.97,4776.671,4778.54,You need to get together regardless is my point.,84,,
768,0.97,4778.54,4780.709,We will be in touch with you all.,84,,
769,0.97,4780.709,4788.783,"We will also, I'm sure the tenants Union is watching.",84,,
770,0.97,4788.783,4795.157,The Seattle Renters Association is also watching.,84,,
771,0.97,4795.157,4796.391,The rent Commission is watching.,84,,
772,0.97,4796.391,4798.793,We will come back to you all on this.,84,,
773,0.97,4798.793,4803.932,For now I wanted to thank you all again for speaking so eloquently to this Committee.,84,,
774,0.97,4803.932,4813.909,"We will be sharing what you have said, the stories you have shared on my counsel office social media as well.",84,,
775,0.97,4813.909,4815.343,We will go from there.,84,,
776,0.97,4815.343,4816.111,Okay?,84,,
777,0.97,4816.111,4817.345,Thank you all again.,84,,
778,0.97,4817.345,4831.126,"Unless there are any points from the Councilmembers, which I don't see, I will wish everyone a good day and a good weekend and adjourn the meeting.",84,,
779,0.97,4831.126,4832.594,Thank you all.,84,,
780,0.97,4832.594,4833.995,Think you Councilmember.,85,,
