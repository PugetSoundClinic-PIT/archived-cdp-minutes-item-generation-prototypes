176,0.97,1039.805,1043.375,Because we are time limited here to ten minutes.,31,,
177,0.97,1043.375,1056.989,We've included a lot of information that in this particular deck that hopefully Council can review at their leisure later and most certainly ask any questions of us at any time here or after words.,31,,
178,0.97,1056.989,1058.19,"Well, it's 30 pages long.",32,,
179,0.97,1058.19,1060.592,And it's all ready--it's on our Website.,32,,

190,0.97,1089.922,1101.467,And first I'd like to acknowledge the Seattle public library is on indigenous land.,36,,
191,0.97,1101.467,1103.335,Specifically the Duwamish people.,36,,
192,0.97,1103.335,1103.869,"Next, please.",36,,
193,0.97,1103.869,1104.97,"And next again, please.",36,,
194,0.97,1106.872,1114.546,"So as we approach our equity work, these are the steps or the focus of our work.",36,,
195,0.97,1114.546,1115.647,Lead with race.,36,,
196,0.97,1115.647,1119.184,Focus on continuous learning and listening at all levels.,36,,
197,0.97,1119.184,1123.522,Strike for equity and access services and programming.,36,,
198,0.97,1123.522,1129.394,Represent and invest in people of color and other Prioritized audiences and communities.,36,,
199,0.97,1129.394,1134.166,"And close the opportunity gap for children of color, next, please.",36,,
200,0.97,1134.166,1141.54,"As we're all aware, and just illustrated in the last presentation, 2020 was an extremely challenging year.",36,,
201,0.97,1141.54,1154.019,"The library responded well during the pandemic and was creative in its approaches to serving patrons, however, we also know that there were many who were not served due to the limitations presented by the pandemic.",36,,
202,0.97,1154.019,1164.396,There's much work to do as we Reengage with patrons and communities here in 2021 and 2022.,36,,
203,0.97,1164.396,1177.543,Our 2020 National library of the year application focused on the work of centering equity and community.,36,,
204,0.97,1177.543,1181.713,"Next, please.",36,,
205,0.97,1181.713,1185.45,Some of these Tom covered.,37,,
206,0.97,1185.45,1193.659,But we provided programming for lots of different audiences and trying to center those most impacted by the pandemic.,37,,
207,0.97,1193.659,1198.83,We talked about virtual library cards and increased Digital collections.,37,,
208,0.97,1198.83,1210.142,We created a Digital resources web page so it was very easy for patrons to find Digital resources for adults and Digital resources for kids.,37,,
209,0.97,1210.142,1216.048,We created a Covid resources page that included vaccination information as it became available.,37,,
210,0.97,1216.048,1221.887,We created a your next job program which we'll go through in a moment and it's supported in eleven languages.,37,,
211,0.97,1221.887,1224.59,We created a lot of social justice programming.,37,,
212,0.97,1224.59,1227.726,"Including love in the time of Covid, reflections in bloom.",37,,
213,0.97,1227.726,1230.596,So it's arts and social justice programming.,37,,
214,0.97,1230.596,1236.835,We also created a range of virtual programming for youth.,37,,
215,0.97,1236.835,1244.376,"Multilingual early learning, virtual tutoring, expanded library link, our library card program for students.",37,,
216,0.97,1244.376,1246.612,And virtual youth technology programs.,37,,
217,0.97,1246.612,1251.75,We do recognize this approach of virtual doesn't always reach intended audiences.,37,,
218,0.97,1251.75,1255.387,With the issue of Digital equity.,37,,
219,0.97,1255.387,1258.59,"We implemented other approaches, if you go to the next slide, please.",37,,
220,0.97,1258.59,1262.995,We also employed these strategies to reach our Prioritized audiences.,37,,
221,0.97,1262.995,1268.133,And specifically we worked with many of our partner organizations to really support those communities and get to them.,37,,
222,0.97,1268.133,1274.139,We also implemented our mobile services services to actually move to where our audiences were during the pandemic.,37,,
223,0.97,1274.139,1288.22,"So a couple of things I wanted to call out here obviously with the virtual program we had to create and expand our Captioning and Asl services for patrons, every program we did was Captioned and put on our Youtube Channel.",37,,
224,0.97,1288.22,1300.298,"We Retooled our summer of learning program, which is over 100 years old and we really worked with getting book distribution into communities in response for print reading materials during the pandemic.",37,,
225,0.97,1300.298,1312.577,"We continued with our Wifi hot spot program and delivered to support community organizations, school ports, and shelter locations, our road to reopening work, we have 22 locations open.",37,,
226,0.97,1312.577,1323.288,"We had Restroom services from the start the support our insecurity housed populations, curb side services and mobile services.",37,,
227,0.97,1323.288,1327.359,We also created a full-time equity focused position on our leadership team.,37,,
228,0.97,1327.359,1329.227,Next slide.,37,,
229,0.97,1330.128,1339.604,"So with that, definitely there has been some challenges within our 2020, can you move to the next slide.",37,,
230,0.97,1339.604,1342.307,Definitely just like the rest of the city.,37,,
231,0.97,1342.307,1356.521,We were faced with operating during the global pandemic closure as well as a huge nationwide civil rights movement.,37,,
232,0.97,1356.521,1358.123,A couple things to highlight.,37,,
233,0.97,1358.123,1366.465,Our staff of color bearing burden on the equity work have to deal with the pandemic closure as well as civil rights throughout these times.,37,,
234,0.97,1366.465,1371.67,And our staff had been really learning a lot of different roles.,37,,
235,0.97,1371.67,1376.641,As mentioned we also had to provide and deliver services differently.,37,,
236,0.97,1376.641,1378.91,Like curb side and also Restroom services.,37,,
237,0.97,1378.91,1386.184,So our folks really had to learn different tools and different tasks that they have to learn to deliver these work.,37,,
238,0.97,1386.184,1397.062,"One of the key challenges, particularly around technology, is that many of our folks are not really equipped with laptops for them to work from home.",38,,
239,0.97,1397.062,1411.343,"So especially at the beginning of the pandemic, when we were closed down, many of our folks really did not have that kind of Venue as well as the roles, most of their jobs were performed in buildings rather than in home.",38,,
240,0.97,1411.343,1417.315,We did a lot of accommodating and being creative in terms of allowing staff to work from home.,38,,
241,0.97,1417.315,1418.25,So many challenges.,38,,
242,0.97,1418.25,1437.002,"And you know, one of the key things that we have done also is really to Repurpose our laptops that are being used by patrons so that our staff can use them temporarily so many challenges and just as the rest of the city.",38,,
243,0.97,1440.338,1449.414,"Yes, and I wanted to point out again that we have several other tool kits mentioned.",39,,
244,0.97,1449.414,1452.784,Racial equity tool kits in this desk.,39,,
245,0.97,1452.784,1459.524,"We use these to inform our process, our programming, our services that we're considering.",39,,
246,0.97,1459.524,1467.432,"And this year, obviously there were some new requirements of documenting the racial equity tool kits.",39,,
247,0.97,1467.432,1472.17,"Unfortunately, we did not hear about some of those until the report format was announced.",39,,
248,0.97,1472.17,1489.221,So that made it a little bit challenging and most certainly next year we'll do better on that and be able to work through all of that format and all of those reporting requirements.,39,,
249,0.97,1489.221,1489.554,"Next, please.",39,,
250,0.97,1489.554,1492.023,I'm just going to walk through your next job.,39,,
251,0.97,1492.023,1493.792,A virtual job assistance program.,39,,
252,0.97,1493.792,1497.429,And we do it in eleven languages.,39,,
253,0.97,1497.429,1506.571,"Which are Arabic, Chinese, English, Korean, Oromou, Russian, Somali, Spanish, and Vietnamese.",39,,
254,0.97,1506.571,1522.754,We manage to do those languages because of partnerships with regional library systems and community organizations to increase our reach some we're working with Kcls and Partnering with them and other community organizations like Seattle job initiatives.,39,,
255,0.97,1522.754,1526.057,Puget sound welcome back center.,39,,
256,0.97,1526.057,1529.06,And the Korean service center.,39,,
257,0.97,1529.06,1532.797,And we really launched this in response to the pandemic job loss.,39,,
258,0.97,1532.797,1539.037,Trying to reach those again most impacted.,39,,
259,0.97,1539.037,1542.274,We did a lot of advertising working with partners.,39,,
260,0.97,1542.274,1549.014,"We combined forces to increase our reach and did advertising and service in print, Online, and on the radio.",39,,
261,0.97,1549.014,1555.954,"I'm happy to report that 300 patrons contacted us to use there service, and it's a very high touch service.",39,,
262,0.97,1555.954,1561.259,"They make an appointment, they have a one on one interview and they do follow up appointments.",39,,
263,0.97,1561.259,1563.361,So that was through the end of last year.,39,,
264,0.97,1563.361,1565.997,So late June through December.,39,,
265,0.97,1565.997,1567.566,Over 300 patrons contacted.,39,,
266,0.97,1567.566,1570.902,Úand 70% of patrons received Jo search assistance.,39,,
267,0.97,1570.902,1578.743,"And of all the patrons who contacted, about 50% of the patrons also received assistance with developing job skills.",39,,
268,0.97,1578.743,1584.449,"It wasn't just finding a job, it was assistance with unemployment and also Digital literacy skills.",39,,
269,0.97,1584.449,1588.653,Easy for me to say.,39,,
270,0.97,1588.653,1590.889,"Next slide, please.",39,,
271,0.97,1590.889,1601.199,"So the equity goal and outcome, again, we really wanted to provide much needed assistance, really navigating the workforce development landscape.",39,,
272,0.97,1601.199,1606.037,And again centering those most likely to bill Pacted by the economic impacts of the pandemic.,39,,
273,0.97,1606.037,1615.28,"So we really did center residents from marginalized communities, offering relief services, referrals, improved Digital literacy.",39,,
274,0.97,1615.28,1621.286,And really looked at Seattle's top tier languages to map back to communities and languages they spoke.,39,,
275,0.97,1621.286,1622.854,That program is still continuing now.,39,,
276,0.97,1622.854,1626.224,And we're continuing to add languages and support to it.,39,,
277,0.97,1626.224,1632.631,"Next slide although I think it might actually be that we need to jump ahead now, Tom, is that correct?",39,,
278,0.97,1632.631,1635.6,"Correct, slide 28, please, Nagine.",40,,
279,0.97,1636.434,1646.911,"So as you have seen, in the earlier slides, thrive together, this became our rallying point for staff during this pandemic.",41,,
280,0.97,1646.911,1665.697,And one of the couple things that we wanted to highlight Úhere is that our RSGI change team really continued to meet virtually on a regular basis and bring really our meetings to focus on Self-Care for not only the change team itself but also throughout the library.,41,,
281,0.97,1665.697,1674.339,We also created this cross functional reopening committee with a representation across our organization.,41,,
282,0.97,1674.339,1684.115,"And be able to really provide a lot of Venue to solicit input, particularly from staff, in terms of our path to reopening the committee.",41,,
283,0.97,1684.115,1696.461,"Also our employee engagement committee worked with our leadership to recognize our staff we had quite a bit of staff that were working in person, in building throughout the pandemic.",41,,
284,0.97,1696.461,1698.363,And we really wanted to recognize them.,41,,
285,0.97,1698.363,1711.676,"So they've done a great job of coming up with staff recognition as well as, we had a virtual staff week, really providing and centered around that thrive together.",41,,
286,0.97,1712.377,1715.38,"All right, thank you, next, please.",42,,
287,0.97,1716.114,1726.291,"So looking ahead to 2021, we know we have some things that we're going to be continuing and some additional work we want to focus on.",43,,
288,0.97,1726.291,1732.931,"Our Rsga change team is really looking at new programming for staff, including different ways to engage.",43,,
289,0.97,1732.931,1742.807,Right now we're looking at Caucusing and how we may be able to introduce that into the library system.,43,,
290,0.97,1742.807,1756.254,Equity training--equity programming training is occurring for a large number of our staff and we are also going to be doing racial equity training for the leadership team and the senior management team.,43,,
291,0.97,1756.254,1771.436,But also all of our managers and supervisors through the system to better align all of our work both internally and externally as we look to improve our equity portfolio.,43,,
292,0.97,1771.436,1778.643,Reviewing positions to determine if they can be Repurposed to focus on programming that's rooted in equity and working within the community.,43,,
293,0.97,1778.643,1782.48,And we are increasing our language access.,43,,
294,0.97,1782.48,1787.652,We are working on our language access plan now.,43,,
295,0.97,1787.652,1796.528,And really have a great outlook on how we can do better in all that we do and produce with various languages.,43,,
296,0.97,1796.528,1799.831,And a continued focus on our road to reopening.,43,,
297,0.97,1799.831,1806.671,Which will increase access to all those in the Seattle area.,43,,
298,0.97,1806.671,1811.676,I'll end here and ask if there are any questions.,43,,
299,0.97,1811.676,1817.515,"Just briefly, Tom, how many employees are at the libraries now?",44,,
300,0.97,1817.515,1820.785,"There's approximately--when we're fully staffed, approximately 700.",45,,
301,0.97,1820.785,1825.924,"And so I know this, but I think the public doesn't know this, how many libraries do we have?",46,,
302,0.97,1825.924,1827.992,And how many are open right now?,46,,
303,0.97,1827.992,1830.595,We have 27 locations right now.,47,,

336,0.97,1946.444,1950.915,It was like the ground was suddenly pulled from under our feet.,59,,
337,0.97,1950.915,1966.397,"The department Pivoted from its primary function as a community, events producer and promoter and partner to our long-term lease tenants to its primary city attorney function to shelter people in need.",59,,
338,0.97,1966.397,1968.299,Most staff went to work at home.,59,,
339,0.97,1968.299,1973.171,Except for those needed to carry out on site departmental operations.,59,,
340,0.97,1973.171,1984.482,Seattle center has long seen the Department's contribution to the city's social justice initiative and what we can offer the community through our events and activities.,59,,
341,0.97,1984.482,1989.354,And our Rsji program needed to shift with the pandemic as well.,59,,
342,0.97,1989.354,1991.356,No more In-Person cultural events.,59,,
343,0.97,1991.356,1992.457,No more lunch and learns.,59,,
344,0.97,1992.457,1993.858,No more staff gatherings.,59,,
345,0.97,1993.858,1999.797,And no more opportunities to include resident organizations in the broader community.,59,,
346,0.97,1999.797,2003.835,"And important discussions around diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice.",59,,
347,0.97,2003.835,2012.243,"At the same time, our staff was deeply affected by events in the world in the murder of George Floyd and others.",59,,
348,0.97,2012.243,2022.653,These events brought racism to the forefront of everyone's consciousness prompting people to organize and speak out against racial injustice in our country.,59,,
349,0.97,2022.653,2031.362,"Concurrently, the race and social justice change team faced major changes as long time leadership retired or stepped aside in 2020.",59,,
350,0.97,2031.362,2040.471,"I want to comment our current change team Coleads, Natonia and Vivian who are here with me today for stepping up to fill those roles on the change team.",59,,

353,0.97,2054.252,2060.658,But I will comment on them as we go through.,59,,
354,0.97,2060.658,2061.826,"So Nahime, let's move on.",59,,
355,0.97,2061.826,2067.031,The team provided an invaluable outlet for Seattle center staff.,59,,
356,0.97,2067.031,2071.569,Especially those working remotely and feeling isolated during an emotional intense period.,59,,
357,0.97,2071.569,2087.318,"Early on the team embraced remote meetings to hold space for staff to support each other through the isolation, the pandemic cause, they also provided opportunities to gauge with staff on the subject of race and social justice which you will hear more about a little later.",59,,

361,0.97,2120.685,2121.519,"Next slide, please.",60,,
362,0.97,2121.519,2133.03,A result of no events or visitors led to the reduced need for supplies and other purchases.,60,,
363,0.97,2133.03,2143.975,And early construction and program bans in addition to city mandates curtailed our use of consultants and so you will see these reductions in our purchasing and consulting numbers for 2020.,60,,
364,0.97,2143.975,2157.588,"If there is any good news in the numbers, it's that although we spent less money, we were able to just about maintain our levels from 2019.",60,,

450,0.97,2649.013,2652.316,I think only ten pages.,81,,
451,0.97,2652.316,2660.624,"Well, I'll kick us off and then I want my colleagues to do the bulk of the talking here.",82,,
452,0.97,2660.624,2671.001,"First of all I want to congratulate colleagues at libraries, I think you did a great presentation and we continue to learn from you all every time we watch your presentation, so thank you for that.",82,,
453,0.97,2671.001,2674.438,And not to be repetitive.,82,,
454,0.97,2674.438,2680.344,"But Obviously, 2020 was a challenging year for all of us.",82,,
455,0.97,2680.344,2690.12,"And the year and a half or so have been tremendously challenging for our communities, the people we serve, and also challenging for team members and our organization.",82,,
456,0.97,2690.12,2728.192,"At Seattle parks and recreation, prior to the crisis of 2020 and into 2021, we had all ready been on a journey like everyone else to understand our role in both creating as well as undoing the traditional harm of racist practices, policies, procedural structures, Covid, racial Reconning, the economic Implosion, and impacts of climate change have highlighted for us the great disparities in our communities and really deepened our commitment at SPR across the board emerging in anti racism and being equity centered.",82,,
457,0.97,2728.192,2753.383,"It's really important to highlight the fact that in addition to our work and serving community just like the libraries and Seattle center and other agencies, we responded to a whole new line of businesses, it was also important to recognize that our robust and committed team of over 900 people, as they were helping communities respond, they were also dealing with the pandemic and the racial Reconning and the climate crisis et cetera.",82,,
458,0.97,2753.383,2759.256,So that added a whole other layer of challenge for us as a team.,82,,
459,0.97,2759.256,2769.099,And I really just want to extend my deepest appreciation to all the members of the parks and recreation team for all they've done and continue to do to work together to support community and each other.,82,,
460,0.97,2769.099,2782.913,"So with that, our hope today is to give you Council members an update on an overview of the challenges, some of the accomplishments in this work of RSGI and then an overview of some of our racial equity tool kit work.",82,,
461,0.97,2782.913,2785.149,But there's a lot of information on the slide.,82,,
462,0.97,2785.149,2787.918,"We'll go over it quickly, and we're happy to answer questions at the end.",82,,
463,0.97,2787.918,2793.857,"With that, I'll turn it over to bee Hill who serves as our equity adviser for the Department.",82,,
464,0.97,2793.857,2795.559,"Thank you, Jesus.",83,,
465,0.97,2795.559,2811.175,"As mentioned and as expressed, you know, in 2020 we experienced parallel and intersecting crisis which presented a shifting context in how we offer parks and recreation services if times of crisis.",83,,
466,0.97,2811.175,2818.682,"The ever present urgent need for equity and solidarity the impacts of climate change, experiencing a public health crisis and economic crisis.",83,,
467,0.97,2818.682,2836.633,"So the shift in context elevated the immediate needs of SPR in our Covid-19 response to provide mission essential services with community showers and shelters, child care for those Furthest from educational justice and teen Hub support.",83,,
468,0.97,2836.633,2844.575,"Enhanced cleaning of facilities and Restrooms, having a focus on keeping parks open while supporting public health and safety.",83,,
469,0.97,2844.575,2850.047,Our virtual programming aimed at the most isolated and outdoor programming and activation.,83,,
470,0.97,2850.047,2864.161,"And I feel it's also important to note that in 2020, operating from a state of emergency and crisis mode to planning and recovery and being transparent.",83,,
471,0.97,2864.161,2869.566,We know that meant there were times of decision making that had to be made quickly.,83,,
472,0.97,2869.566,2878.809,"And with those over arching equity analysis questions, we consciously consider who will be impacted?",83,,
473,0.97,2878.809,2884.848,"Benefit burden, mitigation strategies for Unintentional harm and also taking into consideration public health guidelines.",83,,
474,0.97,2884.848,2893.924,Our engagement with those who would be most impacted by our decision making and service offerings.,83,,
475,0.97,2893.924,2894.558,"Next slide, please.",83,,
476,0.97,2894.558,2902.032,So we felt it also important to just provide some context on SPR's Pathway to equity.,83,,
477,0.97,2902.032,2907.371,Although Pathway to equity was adopted as a frame work in 2019.,83,,
478,0.97,2907.371,2917.948,This frame work is one guiding approach to lend to supporting SPR's commitment to the advancement of the race and social justice initiative.,83,,
479,0.97,2917.948,2927.357,Our North Star is to build SPR as a Transformational anti racist and equity centered Department.,83,,
480,0.97,2927.357,2928.759,Utilizing the Anti-Racist organizing approach.,83,,
481,0.97,2928.759,2967.731,"At this stage of Pathway to equity and the frame work that it provides, it utilizes the following pillars of organizing and advocacy, building relationships and infrastructure, training and applied learning, accountability, and embedded practice, and that embedded practice being Normalizing and Operationallizing anti racism and equity centered operations in our culture and our daily practice, and we can thank Pathway to equity for providing Foundational elements to support our anti racist and equity centered infrastructure.",83,,
482,0.97,2967.731,2973.804,"Next slide, please.",83,,
483,0.97,2973.804,2977.874,I'm not sure if my colleagues are muted.,83,,
484,0.97,2979.476,2981.345,I can start.,84,,
485,0.97,2981.345,2982.012,Sorry about that.,85,,
486,0.97,2982.012,2986.55,All right.,86,,
487,0.97,2986.55,2986.883,Thank you.,86,,
488,0.97,2986.883,2990.52,So the 2020 Rsj accomplishments.,87,,
489,0.97,2990.52,2996.493,We all ready covered Pathway to equity.,87,,
490,0.97,2996.493,3002.766,So I will defer to Angela to cover the equity innovation LABS.,87,,
491,0.97,3002.766,3026.023,"Yeah, the equity innovation LABS, if you haven't heard of it, it's a new innovation tool that was actually developed by bee Hill and Shananika Mcilroy who are our colleagues, and it's an engagement tool that assists our staff with Participatory decision making processes.",88,,

512,0.97,3213.777,3222.719,"And we're grateful for that with the rise of the racial unrest within the nation and the city, there was a lot of work that we could see that was going to be needed to be done.",92,,

516,0.97,3252.015,3259.289,And the growth of our infinity group from 2007 was two.,92,,

521,0.97,3278.241,3279.609,Our actual was 24%.,93,,
522,0.97,3279.609,3281.411,With consulting the goal was 26%.,93,,
523,0.97,3281.411,3283.346,And our actual was 52%.,93,,
524,0.97,3283.346,3291.888,And it also highlights our prompt pay of 93% in which we're increasing that goal to 95%.,93,,
525,0.97,3291.888,3294.591,As well as our consulting goal for 2021.,93,,
526,0.97,3294.591,3305.035,"I know in the interest of time we have to keep moving, however we just want to say that, you know, we are more than willing to provide additional documentation and information as we continue to go.",93,,
527,0.97,3305.035,3311.074,"And with that next slide, I will turn it over to Jesus with the servicing program equity.",93,,
528,0.97,3314.477,3332.796,"There's not a ton of information on here, but I will say at a high level like everyone else in an era when we had to respond with mission central functions to really support community with reduced resources and with increased restrictions because of the Covid pandemic, we really had to focus our service delivery.",94,,
529,0.97,3332.796,3335.598,And that focus was really driven by an equity Lense.,94,,
530,0.97,3335.598,3344.374,And a couple examples I'll highlight here for example are continuation of providing child care programming.,94,,
531,0.97,3344.374,3363.226,"First focused on our first responders but then really focusing on ensuring that we were surveying the needs of the children who were Furthest from educational justice and as an example, 60% of the children who participate in child care in 2020 were from families that identified as Bipoc.",94,,
532,0.97,3363.226,3381.378,So we continued like the other organizations in addition to our Bipoc communities we saw a need in our special needs population and folks like Angela and others continued work on virtual programming to ensure that we would be able to continue those offerings.,94,,
533,0.97,3381.378,3383.847,And we'll continue to focus.,94,,
534,0.97,3383.847,3408.338,"Another key highlight of the equity focused on our limited programming during 2020 was as we moved away from buildings and outside and trying to bring our recreational activities through mobile Rec and a program called Rec in the streets going into parks, we really focused on communities again that were primarily Bipoc and really we could identify as in greater need.",94,,
535,0.97,3408.338,3418.915,So the pandemic and all the crisis really forced us to make decisions that I think really allowed us to focus greatly with an equity Lense.,94,,
536,0.97,3420.116,3421.985,"Next slide, please.",95,,
537,0.97,3421.985,3435.965,In highlighting some of the Rsj challenges in 2020 one of the most important equity challenges presented was the fact that any community engagement for most of 2020 had to be conducted virtually.,96,,
538,0.97,3435.965,3448.578,"And given the Digital gap among Seattle communities and many communities, this meant we undoubtedly missed a portion of the population who were unable to participate in virtual meetings.",96,,
539,0.97,3448.578,3459.656,"So we must continuously be intentional, continuously build on robust ways in providing a variety of ways to engage with community.",96,,
540,0.97,3459.656,3465.094,And our position is seeking to hear from communities most impacted by the crisis that we have faced.,96,,
541,0.97,3465.094,3467.63,And how their needs have shifted.,96,,
542,0.97,3467.63,3496.492,"As well as our internal staff infrastructure and the impact we must equally build upon our resources and investments to build an internal infrastructure that supports employee health, safety, well being in times of hardship as our employees, and particularly front line employees provide essential services while also personally experiencing the impacts of Intersectional and parallel crisis.",96,,
543,0.97,3496.492,3516.212,"As we continue to move forward, the dedicated time for front line staff for Rsj training, Angela and Belinda mentioned in the previous slides about our foundation for change training and we took 2020 to be intentional in our planning to develop out our applied learning and growth opportunities.",96,,
544,0.97,3516.212,3517.146,Centered in Rsji.,96,,
545,0.97,3517.146,3528.024,"During 2020 so that we have now moved into consistent, weekly training with our foundations of change.",96,,
546,0.97,3528.024,3531.294,"Next slide, please.",96,,
547,0.97,3531.294,3534.731,So 2020 equity analysis tool utilization.,96,,
548,0.97,3534.731,3538.835,I have highlighted here two racial equity tool kits that were utilized.,96,,
549,0.97,3538.835,3564.661,"However, I also wanted to mention that we focused on further development and refinement, the Department's equity analysis tools and those tools being the equity impact filter, recreation programming tool, budget analysis tool, our GIS equity mapping tool and equity consideration planning in our planning development and maintenance division.",96,,
550,0.97,3564.661,3587.784,The GIS annual mapping tool for example utilizes the race and social equity index to inform that in direct equitable service delivery this allows for example our maintenance teams and parks and environment to have the ability to be Proactive verses Reactive and Prioritizing service delivery daily and in identified equity zones.,96,,
551,0.97,3587.784,3588.551,"Next slide, please.",96,,
552,0.97,3588.551,3592.488,I hate to--I'm going to have to have you wrap it up pretty soon.,97,,
553,0.97,3592.488,3597.293,We have a hard stop at 3:00 or we're going to lose the Quorum.,97,,
554,0.97,3597.293,3611.341,"Our equity impact filter was applied to, the ranch and this was our North Star to build wealth and power in Bipoc communities, next slide, please.",98,,
555,0.97,3611.341,3618.581,And the racial equity tool kit was also applied with our Cal Anderson Visioning project.,98,,
556,0.97,3618.581,3627.49,And this was an outreach process to receive input and address potential design and programming interventions at Cal Anderson.,98,,
557,0.97,3627.49,3629.993,Next slide.,98,,
558,0.97,3631.094,3632.729,We'll just wrap up here.,99,,

560,0.97,3641.437,3644.173,Jesus has been having monthly meetings.,99,,
