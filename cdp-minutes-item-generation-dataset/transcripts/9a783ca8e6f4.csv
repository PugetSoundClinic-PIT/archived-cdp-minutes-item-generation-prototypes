502,0.97,3278.675,3279.009,All right.,141,,
503,0.97,3279.009,3285.982,"In 2021, just over 60 Cannabis stores located in Seattle sold over $185 million in Cannabis products.",141,,

505,0.97,3296.626,3302.832,"I want to personal layer say my store on average, does double that.",141,,
506,0.97,3302.832,3309.105,The most profitable single location sold over $12 million in Cannabis products in 2021.,141,,
507,0.97,3309.105,3319.215,One retailer with five locations sold over $24 million in Cannabis products in 2021.,141,,
508,0.97,3319.215,3326.156,That is quite a big chunk of change.,141,,
509,0.97,3326.156,3327.824,"Now, what was once illegal is now essential.",141,,
510,0.97,3327.824,3335.965,"Just 12 years ago, people in Seattle were arrested and convicted of Cannabis crimes.",141,,
511,0.97,3335.965,3341.504,Planning and Brown people were disproportionately targeted for Cannabis arrests.,141,,

513,0.97,3346.142,3351.848,"And during the pandemic, workers were considered part of the essential work force.",141,,
514,0.97,3351.848,3366.196,However Cannabis workers are offered few protections on the job.,141,,
515,0.97,3366.196,3370.1,"In Seattle, weed and seed targeted predominantly black residential neighborhoods.",142,,
516,0.97,3370.1,3387.851,"Nationally, black people were arrested at a rate of nearly four to one for Cannabis offenses, despite similar rates of use as all Americans.",142,,
517,0.97,3387.851,3392.055,Retail store owners in Washington are disproportionately white.,142,,
518,0.97,3392.055,3395.925,"Front line minimum wage workers are disproportionately black, Indiginous or people of color.",142,,
519,0.97,3395.925,3408.438,I have also observed that a lot of our staff happen to be female.,142,,
520,0.97,3408.438,3411.975,Ening that is worthy of noting as well.,142,,
521,0.97,3411.975,3426.79,"Cities like Portland, San Francisco, Sacramento, Los Angeles all have programs that provide Cannabis equity funding training for Cannabis workers, and social equity licenses.",143,,
522,0.97,3426.79,3434.898,Now I also want to emphasize that California has what I would consider Incleesed security measures regarding operations.,143,,
523,0.97,3434.898,3445.608,And I know that that is going to ring true to what I'm going to mention later on as we.,143,,
524,0.97,3445.608,3458.621,"Now, last year, I was part of a process of identifying top community priorities around Cannabis members of over 40 community groups.",144,,
525,0.97,3458.621,3463.726,These came out as the top three.,144,,

529,0.97,3489.152,3489.853,Correcting the wrongs.,144,,

531,0.97,3490.453,3493.156,And we'll talk a little bit more about that.,144,,
532,0.97,3493.156,3496.359,Because I'm the fourth Panelist.,144,,
533,0.97,3496.359,3498.161,I won't be speaking first.,144,,
534,0.97,3498.161,3509.272,And I'm not sure who is going first . I know I'm going last.,144,,

540,0.97,3551.581,3551.648,.,146,,
541,0.97,3551.648,3591.321,"The finances Department within the city of Seattle did a prep Tation last year in December from the race and social justice initiative team and their team said the Finance and menstruation team is working on a high level program framework incorporating interdepartmental collaboration with office of economic development and construction and inspection to help support businesses in developing work via the office of economic development and the Department of construction and inspection is working to support the industry through expansion of Cannabis zoning, but through a social equity lens.",147,,
542,0.97,3591.321,3595.725,And that they were looking at funding and community partners that still needed to be identified.,147,,
543,0.97,3595.725,3608.438,And they locked at potential funding if the city's dispersement of the Cannabis excise tax was this $1.3 million to $1.4 million annually.,147,,
544,0.97,3608.438,3610.907,They noted the taxes currently distributed into the general fund.,147,,
545,0.97,3610.907,3627.724,I think when we have seen is the current remedy we received from this tax are not probably to adequately address the comprehensive items that are needed to reform the Cannabis equity and work force development you have just outlined.,147,,
546,0.97,3627.724,3641.471,So wanted to draw for our commit at the members a connection back to our December 7 presentation and just lift up how it highlights the connection with FAS.,147,,
547,0.97,3641.471,3649.112,Council member Nelson I'll put you first in the Queue and come right back to you as the first one up to speck.,148,,
548,0.97,3649.112,3661.557,Good morning and thank you for letting me add that piece that you all have done I'll turn it become over to you I don't good morning.,148,,
549,0.97,3661.557,3661.958,"Hello, everyone.",148,,
550,0.97,3661.958,3667.063,I am the advocacy Directter for the freedom project.,148,,
551,0.97,3667.063,3679.509,Thank you all for having me today to discuss why ex sponging is necessary.,148,,
552,0.97,3679.509,3696.292,The Washington state court ruled our state felony simple drug possession law was unconstitutional and the statute was ruled Uncontinues fusion al because it Criminalized innocent and passive conduct.,148,,
553,0.97,3696.292,3709.639,"Before Legalization of Cannabis, black people were 2.8 times more likely to be arrested for Cannabis possession than whites in Washington state, and 88% of those arrests were for Cannabis possession only.",148,,
554,0.97,3709.639,3720.216,This unconstitutional drug law was the tip of the spear used by law enforcement and even prosecutors to directly target black communities through programs such as weed and seed.,148,,
555,0.97,3720.216,3727.39,Weed and seed was employed against the central district in the early 90S.,148,,
556,0.97,3727.39,3733.663,And this racist ploy contributed to mass Incarceration and obviously Gentrification.,148,,
557,0.97,3733.663,3741.904,In 1970 the central district was 7 a% black.,148,,
558,0.97,3741.904,3743.906,Today it is less than 15% black.,148,,
559,0.97,3743.906,3751.013,What we know as a black issue continues to effect those convicted after they have served Yale or prison sentences.,149,,
560,0.97,3751.013,3761.824,A lot of people still believe that having a Cannabis felony isn't harmful because it has been Legalize in Washington state but that can't be further than the truth.,149,,
561,0.97,3761.824,3776.539,"Some fact these Felonies create several forms of discrimination against individuals convicted in the areas of employment, housing, education, public benefits and jury service, just to name a few.",149,,
562,0.97,3776.539,3784.18,We all should recognize having a Cannabis felony conviction still impacts those currently incarcerated.,149,,
563,0.97,3784.18,3797.827,"People are currently serving longer sentences due to them having a felony possession charge on their record, which in turn increases their standard range.",149,,
564,0.97,3797.827,3809.338,There are all different reasons why ex Spongement is necessary to loaf 80.,149,,
565,0.97,3809.338,3816.345,But ex Spongement and funding those directly impacted are at the Forerobert of these conversations.,149,,
566,0.97,3816.345,3819.582,And that this they are load not guilty in Additiontive.,149,,
567,0.97,3819.582,3832.128,Testimony times we talk to Themmen stead of relevant Lizing they have the world series.,149,,
568,0.97,3832.128,3843.539,"There are Mcled, and we should ensure that we allocate these funds into the community and not through any outside organization trying to pull off or gather funds.",149,,
569,0.97,3843.539,3849.345,So I will pass it become.,149,,
570,0.97,3849.345,3855.718,Thank you all for having me.,149,,
571,0.97,3855.718,3857.687,Thanks so much.,150,,
572,0.97,3857.687,3861.524,"Yes it does, thank you.",151,,
573,0.97,3861.524,3864.026,Please go ahead.,152,,
574,0.97,3864.026,3864.927,Thanks for being here.,152,,
575,0.97,3864.927,3865.761,Thank you Council members.,153,,
576,0.97,3865.761,3874.237,For allowing me today to have a moment to talk on the Pam and to share briefly a part of my story.,153,,
577,0.97,3874.237,3880.343,"I'm key Porter, a plowed central district native and Evergreen college graduate with a Bain business management.",153,,
578,0.97,3880.343,3906.168,And I have had the privilege to have an extensive management career in the unregulated medical Recreationallance Larry Cannabis mark here some Washington I now work as a medical Cannabis consultant and I work at a medically endorsed pot shop here some Seattle.,153,,
579,0.97,3906.168,3913.376,"And approximately, I would say, two months ago I was staring down the barrel of a gun.",153,,
580,0.97,3913.376,3921.317,Two assailants came into our shop and they didn't want any Cannabis products at all.,153,,
581,0.97,3921.317,3922.018,What they wanted was cash.,153,,
582,0.97,3922.018,3933.296,"They demanded for all the cash in the shop, because they knew like most of the workers in the Cannabis industry.",153,,
583,0.97,3933.296,3936.165,That our industry was a cash only business.,153,,
584,0.97,3936.165,3946.609,"Depending on any given day, we could have 30 to $100,000 in money with limited security, minimal training requirements.",153,,
585,0.97,3946.609,3950.746,And that is what happened to us that night.,153,,
586,0.97,3950.746,3966.862,"The security guard stormed into the building to an presented and help us out and they actually got pistol whipped several times, and blood just splattered on the walls and dampened the floors.",153,,
587,0.97,3966.862,3979.976,"As they were preoccupied trying to Rob our store, all I could remember Army crawling closer and closer to the door was my 2- year-old son, who happened to be five blocks up the street.",153,,
588,0.97,3979.976,3987.683,"And I wondered, if that moment, how desperately close he would have been to a place where I could have potentially died.",153,,
589,0.97,3987.683,4004.633,"And in that moment, it didn't matter if I was a medical Cannabis consultant who had dedicated her whole entire life to make sure medical patients had access to Cannabis.",153,,
590,0.97,4004.633,4008.204,Making Hur that we have strains available in sharing Den Nettics.,153,,
591,0.97,4008.204,4019.715,"It didn't matter that I had eight years in this city, trying to make sure that it was innovative.",153,,
592,0.97,4019.715,4026.122,"But I wondered if I had died that knit, would there have been laws passed then?",153,,
593,0.97,4026.122,4042.838,Would there have been any policies and if I reform that dollars have been made in would there Rob any initiatives you know that would have been Revisited then?,153,,
594,0.97,4042.838,4044.34,And I honestly don't know.,153,,
595,0.97,4044.34,4048.377,My community has risks our lives for decades.,153,,
596,0.97,4048.377,4057.787,23rd and Union or 26th and Cherry or when I clock in tomorrow at 7:30 A.M.,153,,
597,0.97,4057.787,4095.691,"There is little pride, no support, no representation programs or even excitement about the Bipoc communities that have been awarded a license and they have had years of pioneering and they can contribute their expertise through the industry that has now made millions.",154,,
598,0.97,4095.691,4105.201,"As Zion had mentioned, we are now moving from illegal to essential.",154,,
599,0.97,4105.201,4108.604,So we are trying to work together saying what do we need?,154,,
600,0.97,4108.604,4112.308,What does this industry here in Washington need?,154,,
601,0.97,4112.308,4119.281,"Personally, I feel it is reform, restoration and redistribution.",154,,
602,0.97,4119.281,4128.457,I have the opportunity to participate in a 13-week program in California that works specially toward social equity applicants.,154,,
603,0.97,4128.457,4147.343,"And no matter what state you are from, if there was any existence of a social equity market, they would work hand in hand with you to make sure they found whether you were a retail producer, processor, they made sure they found a location.",154,,
604,0.97,4147.343,4149.278,Then there is a P.O.,154,,
605,0.97,4149.278,4168.898,"S system, plenty of Township, previous applicants that were awarded licensee dollars, anyone that would basically volunteer their time to basically help the next again ration of pine Mountaineers definitely enter into the industry and make their own way.",154,,
606,0.97,4168.898,4183.012,"I just really feel as if that experience gave me a light to see the potential of what could happen here in Seattle X through that experience, I noticed the relationship that actually the state had with its Socialeningty applicants.",154,,
607,0.97,4183.012,4201.397,"And it was really an Exiting time for the next generation of us to figure out different, Inknow Ratetive ways to where we could have accessibility to recreation al and medical Cannabis.",154,,
608,0.97,4201.397,4211.574,So I just wanted to say thank you guys so much for letting me share my story today and my expertise.,154,,
609,0.97,4211.574,4234.63,"And that I really recommend that we focus on expunging Cannabis records, definitely Cannabis equity tags, making sure those funds were definitely allocated back into the communities that have been having the most effect with the war on drugs, that we have equity Commission that definitely works with the community hand in happen.",154,,
610,0.97,4234.63,4241.003,"So always get recommendations of what the uptown wants and needs, especially with those funds.",154,,
611,0.97,4241.003,4259.622,"And that there is definitely work force development, definitely protecting the workers, especially the front of the lines dealing with cash businesses like we are and I just wanted to say that I represent that community.",154,,
612,0.97,4259.622,4277.74,"And we are here, and whether we are on the other side of that gun desperately barging in and wanting to Rob, or on the other side, trying to make sure that people had accessibility, that all needs are being met, so people don't have to have the same experiences that I have.",154,,
613,0.97,4277.74,4279.675,Thank you so much.,154,,

631,0.97,4352.247,4359.655,But to echo the sentiment that is a serious and pervasive issue in the Cannabis industry right now that needs to be addressed.,157,,

638,0.97,4390.085,4402.364,And the moral dilemma of creating a Cannabis industry that further strategic identifies social classes rather than attempting to correct the tragic impacts of the war on drugs in marginalized communities.,157,,
639,0.97,4402.364,4413.442,So therefore I'm really excited to be here this morning and to be able to talk about these things and to be able to talk about what I have experienced firsthand in my four years of working in the Cannabis industry.,157,,
640,0.97,4413.442,4414.476,"So Yeah, let's get started.",157,,
641,0.97,4414.476,4422.751,One of the most important things for me as a young person who just graduated is upward mobility and career growth.,157,,
642,0.97,4422.751,4435.998,"So while ponder gave me a job and funded each my medical Cannabis consultant training, I haven't really received the type of training or advancement that will be in to bolster my success.",157,,
643,0.97,4435.998,4444.039,"If fact, I have kind of been strategically prevented from growing.",157,,
644,0.97,4444.039,4453.415,"So in August of this past year, I applied to graduate school at the University of Maryland school of Pharmacy to study medical Cannabis, science and Therapeutics.",157,,
645,0.97,4453.415,4460.222,"And I asked my employer for a letter of recommendation, which I needed for my application, and he refused to bright one.",157,,
646,0.97,4460.222,4467.229,And I'm assuming that is probably because we recently unionized the store and he has been pretty upset about that.,157,,
647,0.97,4467.229,4476.939,"In fact, he is threatening to close the store and has been talking about wanting to close ponder, putting the property up for sale since last year.",157,,
648,0.97,4476.939,4481.844,So this has been like a really big battle for me.,157,,
649,0.97,4481.844,4492.454,"But Luckily, through the Union, I'm able to get a free college benefit, so I'm now in a post secondary program continuing my education in Cannabis studies.",157,,
650,0.97,4492.454,4495.791,And this is really just preparing me for graduate school in August.,157,,
651,0.97,4495.791,4503.899,Through the Union I'm able to get the kind of career training and development that I'm not getting from my employer.,157,,
652,0.97,4503.899,4512.574,And then job protection is also another really Important.That I wanted to bring up today.,158,,
653,0.97,4512.574,4521.383,"As our owner John branch is threatening to sell the business after we formed a Union, it is really important that we strengthen successor ship laws.",158,,
654,0.97,4521.383,4530.926,So that in the event of a change of owners our rights as workers to organize and bargain collectively is protected.,158,,
655,0.97,4530.926,4536.565,This is kind of like a chronic thing that we have been experiencing at ponder.,158,,
656,0.97,4536.565,4545.507,"After we formed the Union, he also went and fired three of my Union co-workers, which was illegal.",158,,
657,0.97,4545.507,4555.751,And he ended up having to pay back pay to those workers and also reign stay them for their former positions.,158,,
658,0.97,4555.751,4564.526,"So we have this, right in but in the important for us as like workers to be able to collectively bargain.",158,,
659,0.97,4564.526,4582.811,That we strengthen those pro approximate texts so we don't have these type of issues issues going forward no the last is my excitement for the development of the equity funds under modern Cannabis legal six.,158,,
660,0.97,4582.811,4590.319,I was lucky enough to collaborate with the Seattle black freedom project and the Naacp to help draft this policy initiative.,158,,
661,0.97,4590.319,4591.887,And probably running out of Tim.,158,,
662,0.97,4591.887,4605.934,But I wanted to highlight the major point that an equity Fund and training can help to level the Plegridy field and foster the types of career pathways to ownership that we have been talking about.,158,,
663,0.97,4605.934,4611.64,We have a strong need to equity in the Cannabis community.,158,,
664,0.97,4611.64,4627.99,"It is clear our current industry unfairly Leverages power in the hands of privileged a privileged Demographickic of wealthy white men, who aren't investing in the success of working people.",158,,
665,0.97,4627.99,4633.795,I think they have been mirrored as we said in other cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles.,158,,
666,0.97,4633.795,4642.004,"As one of the first States to legal eyes Cannabis, B & amp; W Offul.",158,,
667,0.97,4642.004,4643.538,So thank you so much.,159,,
668,0.97,4643.538,4645.874,"Thank you very much, Cody.",160,,
669,0.97,4645.874,4649.544,Thanks for sharing your presentation as well.,160,,
670,0.97,4649.544,4660.389,"I just want to say, Additionally, the trauma of being intimidated or harassed in the workplace is also hard to hear.",160,,
671,0.97,4660.389,4669.464,"And I'm thankful that you have shared it, and that there was corrective action taken for reason stating those Cole legs of yours.",160,,
672,0.97,4669.464,4683.612,But foe murder asking for policy solutions so this can be Preempted the if first place and very thankful that you have the UN one reputation so you can speck up and feel safe.,160,,
673,0.97,4683.612,4695.757,"Looking forward to see how we can extrapolate that out, he is residentially given the health and safety issues no okay Zion, I'm going to playoff it become to you to wrap us up and we'll get to questions.",160,,
674,0.97,4695.757,4697.693,Excellent.,161,,
675,0.97,4697.693,4699.294,All right.,161,,
676,0.97,4699.294,4700.629,New a little about me.,161,,
677,0.97,4700.629,4707.069,"I'm a father of six, born and raised in Minnesota.",161,,
678,0.97,4707.069,4713.475,The twin cities.,161,,
679,0.97,4713.475,4717.412,I came here in 2016 shortly after Castillo situation.,161,,
680,0.97,4717.412,4724.252,An African American man who was shot on Facebook live he was like a legal register carrier.,161,,
681,0.97,4724.252,4730.358,"And the Weirdest, most Eariest story is I actually used to sell weed to this guy.",161,,
682,0.97,4730.358,4736.498,"And I lived in St. Paul at the time, and it was just a means of just to make ends meet.",161,,
683,0.97,4736.498,4743.505,He worked at the lunch room at the school that was like two or three blocks away from my house.,161,,
684,0.97,4743.505,4747.175,And sometimes he would walk there and we'd have a short cushion.,161,,
685,0.97,4747.175,4757.352,"He new a couple of poem from the neighborhood, but I didn't really understand it until I saw it on TV who the person was.",161,,
686,0.97,4757.352,4762.991,And I was like you know I have got to get out of here.,161,,
687,0.97,4762.991,4774.069,"So after careful thought of where to go, Seattle except REX Energying to you, just Buzz it is such a progressive place and there is so much opportunity.",161,,
688,0.97,4774.069,4774.336,We came.,161,,
689,0.97,4774.336,4778.473,And I have been a Bud tender for a little over six years.,161,,
690,0.97,4778.473,4787.249,It is all I have done the entire time I have been here.,161,,
691,0.97,4787.249,4791.486,One reason is because I have a felony.,161,,
692,0.97,4791.486,4794.422,In obtaining housing and employment was extremely difficult.,161,,
693,0.97,4794.422,4798.026,I found success working in the Cannabis industry.,161,,
694,0.97,4798.026,4799.361,They gave me an opportunity.,161,,
695,0.97,4799.361,4807.402,"And using the money this I have again rated from working as a Bud tender, I have purchased my first home.",161,,
696,0.97,4807.402,4814.643,"Which is, I moan, I'm super happy about this.",161,,
697,0.97,4814.643,4815.11,Mow and most wife.,161,,
698,0.97,4815.11,4818.38,"But also, I'm an Army veteran.",161,,
699,0.97,4818.38,4840.168,"I work as the Union steward for have a heart, which is like the number one downtown dispensary and has been for six, even roars, for a very long time, back to the medical of those days for business management grad with the.",161,,
700,0.97,4840.168,4849.511,"Can live like Cody where I was hoping to use my credentials, especially as I had been working for have a latter for a little over would years.",161,,
701,0.97,4849.511,4852.047,And I recently acquired my Teague.,161,,
702,0.97,4852.047,4857.118,So I had you know the firsthand knowledge of all the operations and everything that is going on.,161,,
703,0.97,4857.118,4860.589,"And you know, I'm familiar with the operating system.",161,,
704,0.97,4860.589,4861.323,And all that good stuff.,161,,
705,0.97,4861.323,4867.762,But I have yet to have been offered any tip of opportunity.,161,,
706,0.97,4867.762,4872.033,"And they do hire from within, so that is pretty appreciable.",161,,
707,0.97,4872.033,4880.342,"However there is a lot of things that need to improve within the industry, not just from my store, but for Cody's store as well.",161,,
708,0.97,4880.342,4896.091,I also want to talk a little bit about when Canada spoke about as far as the safety in these Dispensaries.,162,,
709,0.97,4896.091,4905.2,Ufc W has been Difficultiently working toward developing a proposal for safety measures for all of the stores.,162,,
710,0.97,4905.2,4911.74,And I just want to say this so it rings true in everyone's ear right new.,162,,
711,0.97,4911.74,4912.774,Double door security entry system.,162,,
712,0.97,4912.774,4915.71,Preventing people from barging in.,162,,
713,0.97,4915.71,4920.916,If you listen to the stories that everyone tells they are overwhelmed at the door.,162,,
714,0.97,4920.916,4925.553,That is where it takes place.,162,,
715,0.97,4925.553,4929.291,"And Lake-Effect I said, I'm prior service military, my store has never been robbed.",162,,
716,0.97,4929.291,4932.761,We are right in the center of downtown.,162,,
717,0.97,4932.761,4939.0,"I feel completely, you have your objective isn't to get away with the money if you are going to Rob my store.",162,,
718,0.97,4939.0,4941.102,But with that being said.,162,,
719,0.97,4941.102,4946.675,I know other stores don't carry that type of security.,163,,
720,0.97,4946.675,4958.086,"And one thing that would really scare me isn't looking down a barrel of a gun, it is what I would do shortly after that.",163,,
721,0.97,4958.086,4972.3,"And I know there is a situation, there has been a situation at dock side off Aurora where the guy, he, I wasn't sure what happened.",163,,
722,0.97,4972.3,4976.171,"But he reacted badly, and he was severely injured.",163,,
723,0.97,4976.171,4977.639,He was shot multiple times.,163,,
724,0.97,4977.639,4981.142,"And like I said, I'm a father of six.",163,,
725,0.97,4981.142,4988.116,"And I know that when someone comes in, you are supposed to just give them everything.",163,,
726,0.97,4988.116,5005.867,"But like I said, I'm a prior service veteran, and my muscle memory in what goes to how I react would be immediately to defend myself and fight for my life.",163,,
727,0.97,5005.867,5012.874,I have been working with that but that really scares me the fact that that is embedded in me that that is a reaction.,163,,
728,0.97,5012.874,5016.711,None of our Bud tenders have any formal training on what to do in a situation like that.,163,,
729,0.97,5016.711,5020.015,I think that is a great talking point there.,163,,
730,0.97,5020.015,5029.824,Is because they haven't had formal training or the training they have might I want fear with what is probably best for the safety of the business itself.,163,,
731,0.97,5029.824,5031.76,I'm going for move on past that.,164,,
732,0.97,5031.76,5035.73,I want to kind of touch on job protections as well.,164,,
733,0.97,5035.73,5046.007,"Before I worked at have a heart, I actually worked for a dispensary Diegos.",164,,
734,0.97,5046.007,5047.942,It is no longer there now.,164,,
735,0.97,5047.942,5053.114,"It was a really up and coming dispensary, owned by a really young 23-year-old guy.",164,,
736,0.97,5053.114,5055.617,He found a better opportunity and he quickly sold the store.,164,,
737,0.97,5055.617,5070.231,"The problem with it is that we have been working there for close to two years, and like I said, I had had trouble Fining employment, other avenues.",164,,
738,0.97,5070.231,5071.566,As had other co-workers.,164,,
739,0.97,5071.566,5076.237,And we just put all of us at an extreme disadvantage financially.,164,,
740,0.97,5076.237,5084.712,"The new owners, their only objective was to keep the management so they can kind of pool Njtv the employees and get them familiar with the operations.",164,,
741,0.97,5084.712,5087.682,But they got rid of everyone else.,164,,
742,0.97,5087.682,5097.125,I just wanted to emphasize that I strongly feel there should be protections involved for those Bud tenders that have definitely been on the line.,164,,
743,0.97,5097.125,5107.035,"And I want to move on, to talk about Expungement, as well.",165,,
744,0.97,5107.035,5113.108,"I know that, I think it was Kiera that talked about the ramifications.",165,,
745,0.97,5113.108,5132.927,"I remember hearing the ramifications of convictions and for the just criminal, but regarding student loans and jury duty, I think, and I wanted to speak, there is one other Avenue that it happens, it happened to me here.",165,,
746,0.97,5132.927,5135.997,And I spoke with a judge from Florida.,165,,
747,0.97,5135.997,5149.944,"And even though this isn't Florida, she did say that it is a problem there, taking medicinal Cannabis users or just recreational Cannabis users.",165,,
748,0.97,5149.944,5157.685,"And it is having effects on dependency proceedings, and how they are viewed as parents.",165,,
749,0.97,5157.685,5164.759,And also it is a grayer area but divorce proceed and go custodial proceedings like this.,165,,
750,0.97,5164.759,5171.065,"I want to make sure that there are protections for that and we rectify things, we lock into that area, too.",165,,
751,0.97,5171.065,5178.406,Because I think that is very important and it is often overlooked.,165,,
752,0.97,5178.406,5182.143,Let's see.,166,,
753,0.97,5182.143,5182.844,I'm sorry.,166,,
754,0.97,5182.844,5185.246,"I'm trying to keep up Ohia, equity.",166,,
755,0.97,5185.246,5194.222,Whatever I think of equity fun and Cannabis the only thing that Pops into my head and excuse me for being forward is Sean Kemp.,166,,
756,0.97,5194.222,5203.364,"I remember when they first opened up, they boasted of being Seattle's first black owned dispensary and I'm not going to lie to anybody.",166,,
757,0.97,5203.364,5205.867,I am that night revised my entire resume.,166,,
758,0.97,5205.867,5216.844,"I put all the bells and whistles on it, like I wanted to be a part of that operation because I felt like I would have more upward mobility there.",166,,
759,0.97,5216.844,5222.083,"Like I really, you guys should have seen my cover letter, it was a mess.",166,,
760,0.97,5222.083,5226.187,"It was great, but I was really hungry for that position.",166,,
761,0.97,5226.187,5229.757,It was later on disclosed that it wasn't black owned.,166,,
762,0.97,5229.757,5237.699,"At the time they made the statement, Sean Kemp had less than 5% of the company.",166,,
763,0.97,5237.699,5248.61,"And you know, it just goes to show that if it is worth mentioning, then they understand the value of it.",166,,
764,0.97,5248.61,5259.02,And I think that I would definitely love to see some black owned success as far as you know retail situations go.,166,,
765,0.97,5259.02,5262.657,"Not just black owned, but all people of color.",166,,
766,0.97,5262.657,5267.428,"I just want to see you know, it not to go to one Pacific Northwest of the pie.",166,,
767,0.97,5267.428,5275.003,The owner of my previous shop and the owner of this shop didn't look like me.,166,,
768,0.97,5275.003,5277.705,He didn't look like none of my other fellow Bud tenders.,166,,
769,0.97,5277.705,5279.807,It is what it is.,166,,
770,0.97,5279.807,5282.71,I would like to see change there.,166,,
771,0.97,5282.71,5294.922,"And then moving onto the last part, I remember Cody spoke about this a little bit.",167,,
772,0.97,5294.922,5295.323,Safety training.,167,,
773,0.97,5295.323,5299.794,I think it is essential that ever since medical has almost been phased out of Washington.,167,,
774,0.97,5299.794,5304.666,I think there are a few locations that do honor it.,167,,
775,0.97,5304.666,5316.711,But what that does is it basically funnels medical patients patients in need of medical grade advice and products to go to recreation al stores in order to acquire the tough.,167,,
776,0.97,5316.711,5329.323,Not all Bud tenders have like top level training and top level understanding in order to help these people navigate these large catalogs of Cannabis products that we have.,167,,
777,0.97,5329.323,5334.529,"And I just think that, like how it was said by Cody, training is very important.",167,,
778,0.97,5334.529,5353.848,I think it would help everybody just kind of maintain a standard to know that when they come into any Cannabis store the people I speak with regarding these products are going to have at least a starting entry level of knowledge to provide to me on whatever busy may need.,167,,
779,0.97,5353.848,5366.36,"And with that being said, I think that pretty punch wraps everything up.",167,,
780,0.97,5366.36,5370.965,Yeah that and I want to emphasize double door security.,167,,
781,0.97,5370.965,5377.805,That should be policy Across- The-Board in Washington to prevent robbery from happening.,167,,
782,0.97,5377.805,5379.64,Thank you so much for the opportunity.,167,,
783,0.97,5379.64,5380.508,Thank you so much.,168,,
784,0.97,5380.508,5387.749,I really appreciate if and I know there will be a handful of questions from our colleagues here.,168,,
785,0.97,5387.749,5397.558,I did also see a lot of emotions of Seconding what you were saying.,168,,
786,0.97,5397.558,5401.763,The panelists were supporting a lot of your recommendations here.,168,,
787,0.97,5401.763,5420.948,"I noted that the Pam here today, providing an introductory framework for us to begin this conversation, I think this is a conversation that I would be interested in having in our community and probably other Council members would be interested in having elements in their community as well over the next if you months.",168,,
788,0.97,5420.948,5447.508,"Specifically you mentioned some of the other jurisdictions that have been bleeding with an equity lens and equity approach to distribution of stores and also upward mobility in for workers and safety so I'm looking forward to hearing more and perhaps we can and Hial time to hear directly from Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, if I cities mention in your slide.",168,,
789,0.97,5447.508,5449.977,And we have questions in the Queue.,168,,
790,0.97,5449.977,5464.525,"Council member Nelson, before I happened it over to you, I want to thank again Council member Herbold, who has been working in public safety and criminal justice issues for a long time, notably around Expungement in the period of time.",168,,
791,0.97,5464.525,5468.129,And has ex pressed interest in Conning to learn more about this area.,168,,
792,0.97,5468.129,5480.041,I think it is supportive of us tackling this issue together.,168,,
793,0.97,5480.041,5483.945,And especially want to thank the Mayor's office.,168,,
794,0.97,5483.945,5487.114,The Mayor himself and the director of limits Slatetive affairs.,168,,
795,0.97,5487.114,5506.133,"And Gerald Hatchinger son, who is the lead if the Mayor's office as the external affairs liaison, has been working in this area and has been in touch with the folks who have been having a series of listening sessions and other strategies.",168,,
796,0.97,5506.133,5512.54,So I look forward to a welcome backing partnership with the executive as well.,168,,
797,0.97,5512.54,5536.564,And is helping to pull together the information from community and working with the Mayor's office as well to see how we can help Ingrate this into our conversation as we look at the possibility of addressing equity and especially the Nexis with financial Committee on equity Fund and how that could be reinvested into equity Commission and other safety measures you all talked about.,169,,
798,0.97,5536.564,5543.137,"Just wanted to get those thank Yous out there, because I know it has been a long process you have been engaged in.",169,,
799,0.97,5543.137,5547.775,Council member Nelson please go ahead with your questions.,169,,
800,0.97,5547.775,5550.177,Thank you very much Madam Kiro.,170,,
801,0.97,5550.177,5553.714,So this has been a long process.,170,,
802,0.97,5553.714,5559.787,I am just now getting into the details of your s Cw proposal here.,170,,
803,0.97,5559.787,5562.023,"And so, I might have a couple of questions.",170,,
804,0.97,5562.023,5586.314,"But off the bat, I want to make sure this I understand that this would be a take on, on Cannabis products, potentially, Buzz the presentation said 25 cents on flour, regardless of the quality.",170,,
805,0.97,5586.314,5597.024,"But the point is that have you brought up, let me just skip that.",170,,
806,0.97,5597.024,5613.407,I REX Mize 245 you that workers are on the front line and that Cannabis retail operations are extremely vulnerable to public safety threats and that was a big part of our discussion in last week's committee.,171,,
807,0.97,5613.407,5637.398,"So that is why I Spore adequately staffing our police Department, Oscar Velasquez is interested in pursuing some hardening to prevent people from being able to drive cars into these buildings.",171,,
808,0.97,5637.398,5640.201,So when you are talking about I support.,171,,
809,0.97,5640.201,5657.918,"I'm wondering if the training you are talking about or the protections that can be provided to the workers through this tax, is that going to be effective against the general deterioration of public safety because of increasing crime?",171,,
810,0.97,5657.918,5665.693,"I want to make sure, I know you are talking about training like how breweries send their folks to training.",171,,
811,0.97,5665.693,5668.429,So is that what you are talking about?,171,,
812,0.97,5668.429,5673.367,And I'm just wondering if you have talked to your owners about that?,171,,
813,0.97,5673.367,5688.149,Because that is the benefit of being organized is being able to negotiate with ownership in on and also I want to make sure this proposal is trying to solve problems that can be solved through this Meck physician I want.,171,,
814,0.97,5688.149,5702.73,"Because the expunging of records, maybe that is, is that something that we take up with the municipal or county courts, et cetera and so those are some of my initial thoughts and questions.",171,,
815,0.97,5702.73,5704.832,But I have some others.,171,,
816,0.97,5704.832,5710.571,I don't know if you want to address those or just have me put them all on the table at once?,171,,
817,0.97,5710.571,5714.208,I think that is good for now Council member Nelson.,172,,
818,0.97,5714.208,5714.975,We can come back.,172,,
819,0.97,5714.975,5720.915,"I want to clarify something, though, before the panel might have some questions or answers to those comments as well.",172,,
820,0.97,5720.915,5728.689,This is step one of I think what will be longer process for looking at possible policy solutions.,172,,
821,0.97,5728.689,5731.992,So there is no draft legislation that our office has approved.,172,,
822,0.97,5731.992,5737.264,There is not a draft piece of legislation that the Mayor's office has sent down.,173,,
823,0.97,5737.264,5755.716,"We are in the process of looking at policy solutions and really appreciate there has been a robust engagement through community organizations and I think really, a front line worker led effort here to make sure that there is a handful of policy options for our consideration.",173,,
824,0.97,5755.716,5765.659,"But I want to make sure that committee members know we are going to go through our own process of locking at other cities, I mentioned the four other cities I would like to hear from as well.",173,,
825,0.97,5765.659,5784.879,"We are going to have a process of hearing more from industry as well as we always have done, hotel worker pro Techs or domestic worker protections, we always make sure there is a broad ten to hear from both folks who are workers and folks who are employers as well.",173,,
826,0.97,5784.879,5816.21,"And I think that the orientation that we are seeking to receipt today that be a request a long time in the making, to make sure we understand more about where is going on in this industry, especially if you lock at the first few slides that were presented in term of the opportunity for funding to potentially be recouped and invested in to addressing worker safety protections and through in Aequity lens to make sure that more workers are seeing the benefit of this industry.",173,,
827,0.97,5816.21,5820.147,"That is, I think the nexus to the Finance Committee.",173,,
828,0.97,5820.147,5823.417,I probably should have started with that.,173,,
829,0.97,5823.417,5846.34,There is a longer conversation to be had here within Council about what a possible policy solution or suite of solutions would look like and that would obviously be led by the discussions that have been occurring here today and directly from the folks who are working on the front loin and experiencing these issues we have heard from today and also I want to check in with some other jurisdictions as well.,173,,
830,0.97,5846.34,5854.582,I want to make sure the Timeline and process is clear.,173,,
831,0.97,5854.582,5857.952,"Zion, go ahead I see your hand up.",173,,
832,0.97,5857.952,5858.319,Yeah.,174,,
833,0.97,5858.319,5866.527,I just wanted to kind of reflect on some of the points I just heard.,174,,
834,0.97,5866.527,5881.742,"One, speaking with the owners in regards to training, specifically like for safety I the owner of our store, we are unionized.",174,,
835,0.97,5881.742,5893.52,"And we recently had a resigning of our Union agreement and our payment, we just had some discrepancies right now.",174,,
836,0.97,5893.52,5906.6,And it is not good on either end in regards to employee toward the owner and owner toward the employees.,174,,
837,0.97,5906.6,5916.777,"I don't think we are each in a, we don't even have a God ton to have any Traction on that.",174,,
838,0.97,5916.777,5929.723,"I guess in the end there is no policy that requires the owners to designate funds for training, regarding safety.",174,,
839,0.97,5929.723,5932.893,"I guess the same goes for Cannabis knowledge, as well.",174,,
840,0.97,5932.893,5943.337,"I would agree, I definitely would agree it should be up to the owner to make sure you are hiring trained people.",174,,
841,0.97,5943.337,5948.075,"And definitely, however I can attest it isn't always done.",174,,
842,0.97,5948.075,5951.345,"We don't always get, it is a recreational store.",174,,
843,0.97,5951.345,5956.25,"People don't get their degrees and say we are going to flock here, you know?",174,,
844,0.97,5956.25,5961.188,So it was kind of difficult we have been working with we got.,174,,
845,0.97,5961.188,5966.293,And that is all I have to say as far as the training goes for that.,174,,
846,0.97,5966.293,5976.27,"Then the safety provisions, the only safety provisions I really was proposing Ind you guys were talking about lick the barriers to stop cars from Impacting it.",174,,
847,0.97,5976.27,6002.363,"But I strongly fell the double doors, the double door security system would definitely have a large impact on those robberies of people barging in and also suppose they did come if and they would tell have to present identification before receiving entry into the store, therefore the people who are robbing you have already been identified, which is a huge factor there.",174,,
848,0.97,6002.363,6006.333,I think that would be a significant deterrent for crime.,174,,
849,0.97,6006.333,6006.834,"Now, but not burglary.",174,,
850,0.97,6006.834,6011.672,"I moan after hours, it is a different story.",174,,
851,0.97,6011.672,6020.114,"Now like I said, the owners don't want, they don't went to cough up this money.",175,,
852,0.97,6020.114,6033.36,"It is a cash operation, right some they are Forking it in and a lot of times, a lot of stores are frequently Understaffed.",175,,
853,0.97,6033.36,6035.229,This morning you can bring if.,175,,
854,0.97,6035.229,6045.105,I think these programs and like the Trainings and the safety provisions can be paid for by the revenue again rated by Cannabis itself.,175,,
855,0.97,6045.105,6050.144,And I think it is a great ton to raise the standard here in Washington.,175,,
856,0.97,6050.144,6058.085,And I know they do the double door entry they think in California and it seems to be the standard there.,175,,
857,0.97,6058.085,6065.492,So I'm hoping we can get rid of this grandfather policy we kind of have here.,175,,
858,0.97,6065.492,6066.093,Thank you.,176,,
859,0.97,6066.093,6066.36,And Cody?,176,,
860,0.97,6066.36,6076.503,I don't so I just wanted to remark on that especially with regard to lick the police.,176,,
861,0.97,6076.503,6081.708,I think it would be more economical to place security burdens on the owners of the stove.,176,,
862,0.97,6081.708,6086.346,"Because police don't prevent crime, they just respond to it after it happens.",176,,
863,0.97,6086.346,6087.481,So right.,176,,
864,0.97,6087.481,6097.057,"So if we are going to actually prevent these robberies from happening in the first place, we can't rely on the police.",176,,
865,0.97,6097.057,6102.596,We have to have proper security mesh hours up front.,176,,
866,0.97,6102.596,6104.298,"Get, thank you very much.",176,,
867,0.97,6104.298,6107.968,Council member Nelson do you have any follow-up?,177,,
868,0.97,6107.968,6111.438,I would like to turn to her we would.,177,,
869,0.97,6111.438,6119.246,"We can come become to you where so, I per.",177,,
870,0.97,6119.246,6131.458,"I mean, double doors, security officers and many, many Cannabis stores are having to do that because we dropped the ball in public safety.",177,,
871,0.97,6131.458,6159.019,"So I appreciate Council member Mosqueda you saying this is an idea and we are going to be developing it going forward I want to make sure before even talking about policy solutions, I would want problems Definn so that we know whether or not the solutions are you know, are that will help narrow our solutions.",177,,
872,0.97,6159.019,6175.269,"So when we are talking about an additional fee to pay for things that the Union is maybe unable to win at the Pittsburghing table, I want to make sure that people are aware.",177,,
873,0.97,6175.269,6321.448,Does Fib know how much the Washington state Cannabis excise tax and just nod without a doubt Cannabis products in Washington state are cheaper than pretty much any other state.,177,,
874,0.97,6321.448,6346.606,So adding a nominal tax on Cannabis products would not affect the Cannabis market if a way that would deter consumers or prevent job growth.,177,,
875,0.97,6347.441,6347.674,Cody?,178,,
876,0.97,6347.674,6353.346,We deal with customers from all across the world.,178,,
877,0.97,6353.346,6363.056,"Coming from meant, Chicago, from Florida, some places that are legal, all I hear is prize are absolutely incredible or they say where is the tax at?",178,,
878,0.97,6363.056,6365.392,We pay $21 for a pre roll.,178,,
879,0.97,6365.392,6379.84,And it is like here in Washington we have $3 pre rolls.,178,,
880,0.97,6379.84,6384.578,When we have eights that we are selling for $15.,178,,
881,0.97,6384.578,6389.85,"And you have customers willing to pay $60 for the super top shelf stuff, I don't understand.",178,,
882,0.97,6389.85,6395.756,"I mean $15 an eighth, you add 25 cents on that and who is going to complain?",178,,
883,0.97,6395.756,6397.357,Or a $60 eighth.,178,,
884,0.97,6397.357,6398.191,Add $5 on that.,178,,
885,0.97,6398.191,6399.86,Who is going to complain?,178,,
886,0.97,6399.86,6405.899,"When they are going for the top shelf, it doesn't matter to them.",178,,
887,0.97,6405.899,6410.17,I have seen to time and time again.,178,,
888,0.97,6410.17,6415.208,I know there is a small increase on concentrates.,178,,
889,0.97,6415.208,6416.643,We have concentrates of $15 a gram.,178,,
890,0.97,6416.643,6425.252,This is stuff you can't each fathom in other states that are already recreational.,178,,
891,0.97,6425.252,6429.356,It is just their legislation is shaped where more money is coming out of it.,178,,
892,0.97,6429.356,6435.061,I haven't even had App opportunity to really assess the dynamic.,178,,
893,0.97,6435.061,6436.83,But I can assure you.,178,,
894,0.97,6436.83,6449.309,The flour here is extremely affordable and from what I'm hearing the only place that can boat our prices is Oregon and that is because they have a severe surplus.,178,,
895,0.97,6449.309,6454.714,Thank you for that for that expert analysis.,179,,
896,0.97,6454.714,6464.424,Council member Herbold thanks for your patience with us.,180,,
897,0.97,6464.424,6464.891,Please go ahead.,180,,
898,0.97,6464.891,6469.462,I want to let our guests know I apologies for being off screen.,181,,
899,0.97,6469.462,6472.365,I had an injury a couple of weeks ago.,181,,
900,0.97,6472.365,6478.839,"I'm bed bound, I would love to find you on camera, but I am unable to do so.",181,,
901,0.97,6478.839,6482.242,Appreciate you being with us today.,181,,
902,0.97,6482.242,6488.715,And sharing with all of us your experience as front line workers.,181,,
903,0.97,6488.715,6500.126,Because the question has been asked I did want to provide a little bit of additional information.,181,,
904,0.97,6500.126,6506.6,Chair Mosqueda did touch upon this in her remarks.,181,,
905,0.97,6506.6,6518.712,"We do have an interdepartmental collaboration with O Eband SD Ci, working on Cannabis zoning for equity licenses.",181,,
906,0.97,6518.712,6530.59,"And the city will receive at least two of those licenses, although the request from black excellence in Cannabis has been for 30 social equity licenses.",181,,
907,0.97,6530.59,6534.06,There is a lot of support at the city for doing so.,181,,
908,0.97,6534.06,6542.402,"But with a recognition that, in order to dough so, we invite you to make some money changes.",181,,
909,0.97,6542.402,6545.672,That is upon Council member Strauss's committee.,181,,
910,0.97,6545.672,6557.884,Another issue that might touch upon work that could be done in the land use committee relates to building code requirements.,181,,
911,0.97,6557.884,6571.097,I was working with the Council and working for a council member who sponsored much of the early zone and go building code requirements for Cannabis as it was just becoming legal first for medical.,181,,
912,0.97,6571.097,6578.838,"And there are some security requirements within the building code, especially if Cannabis businesses.",181,,
913,0.97,6578.838,6584.945,But I agree with the Presenters that we really need to take another look at that.,181,,
914,0.97,6584.945,6592.018,And I think the suggestions around double security doors are brilliant.,181,,
915,0.97,6592.018,6613.039,"Lastly, as it relates to the city's portion of the existing Cannabis excise tax, potential funding for our own social equity Fund, notes that it is currently between $1.3 million, $1.4 million.",181,,
916,0.97,6613.039,6618.912,I do note that community partners need to be identified for the social equity work.,181,,
917,0.97,6618.912,6629.022,"So if Y'all aren't currently in contact with this inter departmental collaboration, I think we need to pull down on making sure those connections are made.",181,,
918,0.97,6629.022,6651.378,"And Lastly, because I do chair the public safety Committee, I do want to express my interest in your recommendations as it relates to expunging records.",182,,
919,0.97,6651.378,6655.248,"I, the city has done some work in the area of vacating records.",182,,
920,0.97,6655.248,6664.424,And I appreciate that there is a difference between vacating records and expunging records.,182,,
921,0.97,6664.424,6670.897,"But in 2018, the city have a CADE 542 convictions for possession.",182,,
922,0.97,6670.897,6694.254,"That is you know, Buzz the city really is only able to, to my understanding, impact the offense that it enforces, specifically misdemeanor offenses, that was universe that we could address.",182,,
923,0.97,6694.254,6700.66,So these are 542 convictions for possession from 1996 through 2010.,182,,
924,0.97,6700.66,6703.196,And then there were no prosecutions after 2010.,182,,
925,0.97,6703.196,6705.932,So that is the vacating of the records.,182,,
926,0.97,6705.932,6717.444,I would like to understand more about when you are proposing around the Expungement of records and how the city could help on that front.,182,,
927,0.97,6717.444,6725.785,"My understanding is that once a record is vacated, it remains public information.",182,,
928,0.97,6725.785,6740.2,"But perhaps there is a way to legislate Expungement, since even though it is apparently ex Punning is already banned by state law, but maybe we could make an argument this is a special case.",182,,
929,0.97,6740.2,6744.07,Because these actions are no longer crimes.,182,,
930,0.97,6744.07,6763.857,"And so the idea of not making this information public information seems like a wise decision, but was very interested to know a little bit more about what your recommendations are in this area.",182,,
931,0.97,6763.857,6764.157,Thank you.,182,,
932,0.97,6764.157,6767.026,"Thank you very much, council member Herbold.",183,,
933,0.97,6767.026,6791.351,"I'm excited, as well, about the questions that you asked about how the city can take that next step from vacation to Expungement and look forward to hearing more from some of the folks on the line here today and then the other folks who might be interested in working on that issue with myself and Council member Herbold and appreciate your long history on working on this area as well.",183,,
934,0.97,6791.351,6794.02,I didn't mean to cut anybody off.,183,,
935,0.97,6794.02,6797.39,If there was any comments or questions in response you are welcome to do that.,183,,
936,0.97,6797.39,6802.629,We have three or four minutes left of our meeting and then we are going to Wrap-Up.,183,,
937,0.97,6802.629,6804.564,Okay.,184,,
938,0.97,6804.564,6805.532,I don't see any hands.,184,,
939,0.97,6805.532,6814.274,"So I'll say thank you very much your comments are very much appreciated and Zion, I do see your hand.",184,,
940,0.97,6814.274,6816.409,Please go ahead.,184,,
941,0.97,6816.409,6822.615,I wasn't sure if anyone was speaking there.,185,,
942,0.97,6822.615,6837.63,I am aware that there is a difference and someone had brought that to my attention last year the difference in between vacate and go expunging.,185,,
943,0.97,6837.63,6850.877,"I guess from when I heard mentioned earlier it is something I'm actually, unfortunately, familiar with, is the felony points.",185,,
944,0.97,6850.877,6853.279,The felony possessions carry opponents.,185,,
945,0.97,6853.279,6863.723,"And for to my understanding, those points can be used against you until seven years after the Probationary period ends.",185,,
946,0.97,6863.723,6874.734,"So it is not just a sentencing, not just the parole or probation, it would be seven years after that duration.",185,,
947,0.97,6874.734,6889.916,And then those those fell if I convictions for that act won't be used against you to increase the amount of time in the recommendation window.,185,,
948,0.97,6889.916,6896.522,"Now, what I was speaking about was it is a little bit harder to keep up with this.",185,,
949,0.97,6896.522,6901.828,"And I, to be honest, I don't even really know how to articulate it properly.",185,,
950,0.97,6901.828,6912.005,I feel like this would be something for an attorney on speak on and I do know one or two that could.,185,,
951,0.97,6912.005,6929.756,"But Dependecy proceedings, parents who have been deemed unfit or negligent to some capacity, in which Cannabis use Recreationally or even Medicinally has been used to support those determinations.",185,,
952,0.97,6929.756,6937.73,"And that, to be honest, I'm going to be Frank, is a very large can of worms and I have no clue where to start with that.",185,,
953,0.97,6937.73,6940.8,Way over my head on that.,185,,
954,0.97,6940.8,6941.768,So I can.,185,,
955,0.97,6941.768,6943.303,Thanked for putting it on our radar.,186,,
956,0.97,6943.303,6954.781,I think that is a good area for us to look into as well.,186,,
957,0.97,6954.781,6959.285,Again God questions.,186,,
958,0.97,6959.285,6972.532,"Just to speak on the felony marijuana possession, we have a bored member who was tried as an adult at 17 and sentenced to 30 years in prison, right?",187,,
959,0.97,6972.532,6986.879,"And so he was able, with our help in the community, to go back and be Resentenced based on the marijuana possession what we know as the Blake issue.",187,,
960,0.97,6986.879,6989.849,A felony possession unconstitutional possession law.,187,,
961,0.97,6989.849,6992.719,So and he was Resentenced with time served.,187,,
962,0.97,6992.719,6998.491,And he was released immediately a couple of days after his Resentencing.,187,,
963,0.97,6998.491,7007.6,And so I know there is a lot of things that we need to draw out and continue to work together at the city level.,187,,
964,0.97,7007.6,7016.843,"But it is very important our courts right now on Backlogged, so we are trying to help support and make this process quicker.",187,,
965,0.97,7016.843,7023.783,Because there are thousands of individuals who can also be Resentenced and be released.,187,,
966,0.97,7023.783,7030.723,"You know, by trust taking their Youthfulness into consideration.",187,,
967,0.97,7030.723,7036.763,"So I just want to reiterate how important it is for us to expunge, vacate, whatever it is.",187,,
968,0.97,7036.763,7037.497,We are here to help.,187,,
969,0.97,7037.497,7040.566,"And that is Yeah, all I have it say.",187,,
970,0.97,7040.566,7040.867,Thank you.,187,,
971,0.97,7040.867,7041.801,Thank you so much.,188,,

974,0.97,7051.077,7060.319,"Again, beginning of the conversation we look forward to hearing here from folks within the industry both workers and some of the industry representatives.",188,,
975,0.97,7060.319,7070.53,"But also, hearing from these other jurisdictions, I think that is my next step to reach out and see if other jurisdictions would be interested in sharing the process they went through.",188,,
976,0.97,7070.53,7077.537,"God lessons there and we in Seattle are often on the cutting edge of exporting good, progressive ideas.",188,,
977,0.97,7077.537,7088.147,"But when other jurisdictions are doing things well, I don't want us to reinvent the whole, I want us to learn from those who have great examples that you all think have a good equity lens applied there as well.",188,,
978,0.97,7088.147,7093.82,I'm going to be reaching out to those other jurisdictions and see if we can offer some time in an upcoming meeting.,188,,
979,0.97,7093.82,7099.759,I also heard three RS and I missed the last.,189,,
980,0.97,7099.759,7107.8,"I think key you mentioned it reform, redistribution and.",189,,
981,0.97,7107.8,7109.702,Restoration.,190,,
982,0.97,7109.702,7110.069,Restoration.,191,,
983,0.97,7110.069,7110.436,Most important.,191,,
984,0.97,7110.436,7110.636,Okay.,191,,
985,0.97,7110.636,7115.741,"So I'm going to be thinking about throws three RS, as we think through possible policy solutions here.",191,,
986,0.97,7115.741,7126.919,"And whether that is on you know the worker training and safety side, whether that is on equitable taxation and fund side, reform, redistribution, restoration.",191,,
987,0.97,7126.919,7144.77,I look forward to hearing more about the social equity applicants and the process that Council member Herbold and myself mentioned and we'll be reaching out to finance and administrative services change team and the other departments that are working with as well to get an update on that process.,191,,
988,0.97,7144.77,7161.821,I also would love to just continue to extend an invitation to all those who are listening to continue to give us ideas as we continue down this path of policy analysis and development and building upon some of the conversations you all have had and policy recommendations that are coming from the community.,192,,
989,0.97,7161.821,7169.028,This is the beginning of a process that I do hope will lead us to some God policy solutions here.,192,,
990,0.97,7169.028,7179.872,So the stories and the anecdotes and the data you provided do have systemic policy solutions to help address the inequities and safety concerns that you have brought up.,192,,
991,0.97,7179.872,7187.013,So thanks for helping to kickoff this conversation today and bringing your expertise to this discussion.,192,,

993,0.97,7187.48,7192.518,"If there is nothing else for the good of the order, I'm going to wrap us Opaquing.",193,,
