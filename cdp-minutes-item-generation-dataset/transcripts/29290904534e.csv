45,0.97,234.901,241.774,I am joined by my colleague Nigel who can assist in answering any questions that I am not able to answer.,12,,
46,0.97,241.774,255.221,"But, I think we should be able to cover it, and let me go ahead and share my screen.",12,,
47,0.97,257.223,261.628,Is everybody able to see that?,12,,
48,0.97,261.628,262.528,Perfect.,12,,
49,0.97,262.528,265.898,Okay.,12,,
50,0.97,265.898,269.669,"So, we have quite a bit of material.",12,,
51,0.97,269.669,276.909,"A lot of which is in the slides, but I'll be doing quite a bit of Voiceover.",12,,
52,0.97,276.909,282.148,"I can see you all, but just jump in whenever you have any questions please.",12,,
53,0.97,282.148,290.957,"So, first up, I just want to talk a little bit about, our budget and five year plan development.",12,,
54,0.97,290.957,298.264,"How our five-year plan works, is it is required by the Ila.",12,,
55,0.97,298.264,300.933,It has to be informed by the regional action framework that already exists.,12,,
56,0.97,300.933,303.836,"Informed by sub regional planning, workshops.",12,,
57,0.97,303.836,308.808,We are looking at having a draft in August of this year to finalize in September.,12,,
58,0.97,308.808,322.555,"Much of the activity that is underway, including our fy 23 budget, our service redesign, all of that stuff flows into or out of the five year plan.",12,,
59,0.97,322.555,326.259,That is the big circular graphic.,12,,
60,0.97,326.259,341.341,"I wanted to start with this because I think it's important that folks be clear that like much of the planning activity currently underway at the authority, is flowing into what we are going to lay out as our five-year trajectory.",12,,
61,0.97,341.341,350.583,"I wanted to do that because I think we get a number of questions around what about this thing, what about this thing.",12,,
62,0.97,350.583,359.926,"For us, we see it as we are required by legislation to chart a course about a broad way forward.",12,,
63,0.97,359.926,365.765,We are on a Timeline to deliver that and that's where a lot of our spending is right now.,12,,
64,0.97,365.765,377.009,What I'm going to try to do right now in part today as I answer some of the questions that were received from you all is also talked about how the things that I'm answering are accounted for or structured within the five-year planning work.,12,,
65,0.97,377.009,387.82,"By way of Timelines, I just wanted to sort of index that against some of the other activities you may have heard about the issue.",12,,
66,0.97,387.82,392.925,"We had our point in time, engagement, pulmonary analysis.",12,,
67,0.97,392.925,399.766,We have a synthesis and we actually have submitted the numbers to HUD as of today.,12,,
68,0.97,399.766,409.342,"Five-year data, or five-year plan data collection also began simultaneously, and then again as I mentioned, we'll have a draft in August.",12,,
69,0.97,409.342,416.149,"In August, we intend to, well, there will be a lot of community input in the five-year plan.",12,,
70,0.97,416.149,419.118,In August we walked it around again.,12,,
71,0.97,419.118,425.124,"Get people's feedback, Marc it up, and finalize in September.",12,,
72,0.97,425.124,431.731,The five-year plan has to be adopted at both the implementation board and governing committee levels.,12,,
73,0.97,431.731,447.88,"Looking at my two governing committee members here, and just flagging that you will see this multiple times and have a lot of opportunity to provide your feedback in terms of the priorities of the authority.",12,,
74,0.97,447.88,455.755,"Thinking about the budget specifically in relationship to this, so, as I mentioned, we are looking at that draft in August.",12,,
75,0.97,455.755,460.126,Informed by community engagement process and incorporating sub regional planning.,12,,
76,0.97,460.126,475.074,"In conversation with Councilmember Mosqueda in her role as budget chair, one of the other things we started to talk about and then confirmed, with our colleagues at the county, is what we are going to do is also attach a six year budget to the five-year plan.",12,,
77,0.97,475.074,483.783,"Some of those numbers, as we move into our ears, will be more a Placeholder.",12,,
78,0.97,483.783,497.864,"What it will allow us to do is to spend, rather than to spend every year generating a sort of the noble budget, like what are we seeing, what are we doing, and Sprinting around for the first half of the year.",12,,
79,0.97,497.864,509.809,"What we will be able to do is have a Placeholder number that if we have been making the right investments along the way, the number for fy 26 should be X number of millions of dollars.",12,,
80,0.97,509.809,525.524,"Any adjustments around that should happen around the edges, really because we are noticing like we are seeing an Uptick in young people who are entering the homelessness system because of an event.",12,,
81,0.97,525.524,532.798,We want to increase our capacity in that program portfolio.,12,,
82,0.97,532.798,538.804,We've actually seen a decrease in the number of folks who are experiencing homelessness in vehicles because we have put a significant focus on that.,12,,
83,0.97,538.804,545.611,"So, we don't need as much vehicle specific outreach for example because we think we are beginning to manage that down.",12,,
84,0.97,545.611,551.05,Those are the kinds of adjustments that we would be looking to make in those coming years.,12,,
85,0.97,551.05,555.221,"Always in relationship to data and to the point of time, et cetera.",12,,
86,0.97,555.221,571.837,"Less of what we are experiencing this year, which is for folks not on the committee, a really conscious Timeline that like, based on our current structure, is not likely to change.",12,,
87,0.97,571.837,600.6,"This Timeline is likely to stay pretty similar in years forward, so by moving to this six year budget in alignment with the five-year plan, we then at least have six years Biennials by the way, we then have the ability to ease into the budget planning with much less of a Oh gosh, what's happening?",12,,
88,0.97,600.6,604.737,"How can we pull all this material together and get the right people to look at it in time, attitude?",12,,
89,0.97,604.737,613.479,"So, the projected budgets that will come with that plan in September will take us through 2028.",12,,
90,0.97,613.479,618.284,I'll just pause there briefly if there are any questions before I moved to the next section of this report out.,12,,
91,0.97,618.284,623.856,Do colleagues have any questions on this first segment of the presentation?,13,,
92,0.97,623.856,624.757,Councilmember Herbold.,13,,
93,0.97,624.757,626.525,Thank you.,14,,
94,0.97,626.525,631.63,I'm just trying to get a sense as it relates to the sub regional planning groups.,14,,
95,0.97,631.63,636.302,Are you saying that Seattle will have its own sub regional plan?,14,,
96,0.97,636.302,638.304,That is correct.,15,,
97,0.97,638.304,639.872,Okay.,16,,
98,0.97,639.872,641.841,"So, how is that being developed?",16,,
99,0.97,641.841,648.914,We have a sub regional planning team led by Alexis.,17,,
100,0.97,648.914,654.854,The sub regional planning specialist is named Sara Carlson.,17,,
101,0.97,654.854,662.328,That team leads our sub regional planning development and she is the planning specialist for Seattle.,17,,
102,0.97,662.328,676.275,"Happy to at a subsequent meeting with this Committee, or off-line briefing, connect you with that sub regional planning team to talk about the Seattle Metro plan development in particular if that is helpful.",17,,
103,0.97,676.275,677.309,Thank you.,18,,
104,0.97,677.309,690.222,"Just as a quick NOTE on that too, look forward to continuing to discuss how we can incorporate that into our work plan, and definitely interested in collaborating on that, so thank you for that effort.",19,,
105,0.97,690.222,690.923,Councilmember Morales.,19,,
106,0.97,690.923,692.725,Thank you.,20,,
107,0.97,692.725,703.536,"Can you just clarify the Seattle plan, that it includes areas out of's the downtown core as well the Citicorp.",20,,
108,0.97,703.536,706.806,Will be entire city be part of that plan?,20,,
109,0.97,706.806,716.716,"Yes, the Seattle Metro Subregion includes the city of Seattle and like immediate adjacent Metro areas.",21,,
110,0.97,716.716,722.755,"Then, so we have seven distinct Subregions.",21,,
111,0.97,722.755,728.994,The Seattle Metro plan will account for all the city.,21,,
112,0.97,728.994,735.468,"Any follow-up on that, Councilmember Morales?",22,,
113,0.97,735.468,737.369,Great.,23,,
114,0.97,737.369,738.337,Okay.,23,,
115,0.97,738.337,742.775,"Ceo Dones, I think we can continue the presentation.",23,,
116,0.97,742.775,744.777,Got it.,24,,
117,0.97,744.777,764.43,Next I wanted to talk about our unsheltered . I want to just briefly NOTE our approach for this was we did conduct a head count of unsheltered individuals.,24,,
118,0.97,764.43,785.751,"We conducted a count of folks who are currently in shelters, and then we also developed a qualitative data collection strategy over the course of the early--well, late winter, February, a little bit into March, where we worked with people experiencing homelessness providers and staff around the county.",24,,
119,0.97,785.751,802.635,"We worked on--well, actually, our colleague Owen which is the deputy chief of community impact led a series of workshops with this group of Stakeholders to collect input from about 200 people.",24,,
120,0.97,802.635,811.41,"Around what should be asked, why should it be asked, what would we want to better understand about what was happening in the lives of our unsheltered neighbors?",24,,
121,0.97,811.41,819.652,"That is what yielded both the study design, and also the questions that we asked people.",24,,
122,0.97,819.652,829.695,"How we engaged, was there a Hub and spoke model, or respondent driven sampling.",24,,
123,0.97,829.695,841.14,Essentially interviewees conducted initial interviews and various Encampments our other places where folks experiencing unsheltered homelessness were gathering.,24,,
124,0.97,841.14,844.61,They would give the person a gift card for their time and a coupon booklet.,24,,
125,0.97,844.61,854.153,"That coupon, that booklet essentially, someone could say like Councilmember Herbold, I think you should also participate in this.",24,,
126,0.97,854.153,857.289,Here is one of the coupons that was given to me.,24,,
127,0.97,857.289,863.529,"From there you could go to one of the hubs, we have nine hubs set up across the county.",24,,
128,0.97,863.529,875.975,We were able to provide bus tickets to and from each of and coordinate all of the--we had food and water and all the things necessary to make sure that people were able to participate.,24,,
129,0.97,875.975,883.949,"Once a person got there they were able to do an interview, fill out a demographic sheet for the head count, and receive their gift card.",24,,
130,0.97,883.949,889.755,"That person in turn would receive their own booklet, so that is the respondent driven sampling method.",24,,
131,0.97,889.755,897.83,"By wave four, we were in conversation with people who weren't really connected with services at all.",24,,
132,0.97,897.83,900.332,They are not often seen inside the context of our system.,24,,
133,0.97,900.332,910.876,"The results of the work, we--sorry, this runs through the 12 design workshops.",24,,
134,0.97,910.876,922.721,We collected over 650 interviews with folks experiencing unsheltered homelessness in the county.,24,,
135,0.97,922.721,938.771,"Because of matching informed consent signatures, and making sure that everything is above board, we believe we will be able to use, as a--for research purposes, probably about 550, 575 of those interviews.",24,,
136,0.97,938.771,952.351,"Everyone was counted though, so we then worked with statistical analysts at Uw who helped do the extrapolation off the statistical model to get to the number that we submitted to HUD.",24,,
137,0.97,952.351,957.69,All of this was worked out with the HUD office.,24,,
138,0.97,957.69,962.261,We received a methods exception in order to do it.,24,,
139,0.97,962.261,968.2,"Some of the confusion in the fall about like, are we doing point in time or not?",24,,
140,0.97,968.2,977.843,There was some Misreporting around when I said you will not be doing the point in time count in the usual way.,24,,
141,0.97,977.843,980.245,"We will instead focus on a different method, right?",24,,
142,0.97,980.245,986.585,"That HUD did, we proceeded, et cetera.",24,,
143,0.97,986.585,987.219,Just for historical context.,24,,
144,0.97,987.219,990.456,The numbers were filed today.,24,,
145,0.97,990.456,994.693,I don't want to go into too much detail.,24,,
146,0.97,994.693,999.531,I want to say I actually prepared a separate briefing on this.,24,,
147,0.97,999.531,1003.669,I think it deserves quite a bit of attention.,24,,
148,0.97,1003.669,1011.41,"Suffice to say is based on our unsheltered analysis, we do see an increase in the number of folks experiencing homelessness through the point in time count.",24,,
149,0.97,1011.41,1022.821,I want to be very clear that we will still be indexing our work against administrative data by and large.,24,,
150,0.97,1022.821,1031.83,So the point in time count gives us a window into specifically who is experiencing unsheltered homelessness.,24,,
151,0.97,1031.83,1052.751,"When we look at who needs our support in this County, the better way to do that is through administrative Crosswalks that we partner with our colleagues at DC Hs around to do last year, to generate the 45,000 number that we now use when we commonly refer to the number of folks experiencing homelessness in the county.",24,,
152,0.97,1052.751,1059.358,The administrative data crosswalk looked at a number of enrollments in the recovery division data.,24,,
153,0.97,1059.358,1063.829,Healthcare for the homeless data.,24,,
154,0.97,1063.829,1069.468,And asks how many people used those things over the course of a year?,24,,
155,0.97,1069.468,1072.337,"That's where we get to 45,000.",24,,
156,0.97,1072.337,1077.076,The point in time count data has always consistently come in lower.,24,,
157,0.97,1077.076,1081.98,"It came in lower, despite its increase, it came in lower the shoe.",24,,
158,0.97,1081.98,1089.021,"We will really want to focus on using that more accurate, higher number, when we make policy decisions at the agency.",24,,
159,0.97,1089.021,1093.292,"I see Councilmember Herbold's hand, so I will pause.",24,,
160,0.97,1093.292,1094.359,Thank you.,25,,
161,0.97,1094.359,1118.217,"I just wanted to recognize that Rha gave individuals, including elected officials, the opportunity to submit specific locations as potential locations for interviews with people living unsheltered.",26,,
162,0.97,1118.217,1122.788,Really appreciated that opportunity to provide you with that information.,26,,
163,0.97,1122.788,1128.36,I imagine that you probably got more locations than you were able to visit.,26,,
164,0.97,1128.36,1128.594,Yes.,27,,
165,0.97,1128.594,1140.372,"[Laughter] so, can you talk about maybe how you decided--like let's say Hypothetically I sent you five different locations.",28,,
166,0.97,1140.372,1142.474,I shouldn't expect you to visit all five locations.,28,,
167,0.97,1142.474,1144.543,How did you decide which ones to visit?,28,,
168,0.97,1144.543,1145.844,"Thank you, Councilmember.",29,,
169,0.97,1145.844,1159.725,"We worked with folks like often times libraries or chambers of Commerce, or folks who had physical sites.",29,,
170,0.97,1159.725,1162.761,Basically it was a little bit of a rush to accommodate.,29,,
171,0.97,1162.761,1170.769,"Okay, these were the types that were provided, that potential locations.",29,,
172,0.97,1170.769,1175.474,Let's reach out and see if they can accommodate us setting up shop.,29,,
173,0.97,1175.474,1179.178,"Running a project out of the location for at least a week and a half, maybe two weeks.",29,,
174,0.97,1179.178,1196.528,"We did the retain, and I should have mentioned this, we retained a list of the places that we didn't activate, and we also looked at where we opened hubs and believed that there may have been still Undersampling.",29,,
175,0.97,1196.528,1203.936,"So, we are in the process of constructing a phase two, which will focus on where did we go?",29,,
176,0.97,1203.936,1205.837,Where we might still learn something.,29,,
177,0.97,1205.837,1215.681,"Where did we perhaps, frankly because of historical patterns of Undersampling, they do not hear from as many people.",29,,
178,0.97,1215.681,1225.39,"For a lot of our locations that are more rural for example, they have not historically had point in time count Enumerators operate in them.",29,,
179,0.97,1225.39,1229.928,"We put the word out, we got in touch with folks.",29,,
180,0.97,1229.928,1231.93,Snoqualmie Valley has a single shelter.,29,,
181,0.97,1231.93,1233.432,No outreach teams.,29,,
182,0.97,1233.432,1240.372,So like putting the word out is very different than when we put the word out in West Seattle.,29,,
183,0.97,1240.372,1249.748,"So, we do believe that there are some places, and even in Seattle Metro, where there may have been some Undersampling.",29,,
184,0.97,1249.748,1252.217,That is where our phase two work will focus.,29,,
185,0.97,1252.217,1259.291,"Will not focus on developing a better count, it will be focusing on hearing what better experiences are to better identify gaps in the system.",29,,
186,0.97,1259.291,1261.727,I can imagine.,30,,
187,0.97,1261.727,1279.611,"I don't know for sure which locations my staff submitted, but I can imagine some of the places I'm aware of in West Seattle, in the Greenbelt, and such, that they are very removed from the types of places that you would use as interview sites.",30,,
188,0.97,1279.611,1282.981,"So, appreciate that follow-up work in phase two.",30,,
189,0.97,1282.981,1285.284,Thank you.,31,,
190,0.97,1285.284,1300.532,"As we did in phase one, we will be Reconnecting with folks to talk through locations and make sure that folks are Situationally aware, and have the opportunity to help guide the work.",31,,
191,0.97,1300.532,1305.37,Are there any other questions?,32,,
192,0.97,1305.37,1307.439,"Okay, I think we can continue on with the presentation.",32,,
193,0.97,1307.439,1309.274,All right.,33,,
194,0.97,1309.274,1312.878,Shifting into discussing programs and performance in particular.,33,,
195,0.97,1312.878,1322.988,"So, we have awarded three Rfp's in Noncovered it shelter.",33,,
196,0.97,1322.988,1333.699,"Chief Seattle Club, the--sorry, I'm Blanking on what the PDA Rebranded as.",33,,
197,0.97,1333.699,1335.534,They are not the public defenders Association anymore.,33,,
198,0.97,1335.534,1337.469,I believe they did a new name.,33,,
199,0.97,1337.469,1347.079,"Public defenders Association may be renamed to something else, received an award as well.",33,,
200,0.97,1347.079,1349.848,"Purpose, dignity, action.",34,,
201,0.97,1349.848,1350.649,Thank you.,35,,
202,0.97,1350.649,1359.157,[Laughter] formerly the public defenders Association and Catholic community services received an award.,35,,
203,0.97,1359.157,1381.713,"So, this will open 50 new tiny homes between achieve Seattle and Catholic community services as well as create capacity for Pba's to continue to operate 84 of the rooms in there just cares portfolio.",35,,
204,0.97,1381.713,1389.187,Do want to be clear that this doesn't resolve the cliff that that program is on broadly.,35,,
205,0.97,1389.187,1391.456,Still work to do.,35,,
206,0.97,1391.456,1407.672,The authority has been and active communication with the city and with deputy Mayor Washington and others about what can be done.,35,,
207,0.97,1407.672,1416.681,My hope is that we will be able to architect a solution and we will of course notify folks as soon as we have been able to do that.,35,,
208,0.97,1416.681,1430.429,Awards that were affected by the loss of Commerce funds were made whole by the repurchasing of funding . There is a total hear of 134 sheltered beds.,35,,
209,0.97,1430.429,1440.338,"Could serve more depending, could serve more people depending on program models and who is alone, couples, et cetera, et cetera.",35,,
210,0.97,1440.338,1444.709,That is the status of our Noncognitive work.,35,,
211,0.97,1444.709,1453.552,"On our safe parking Rfp, our 2020 point in time count identified about 3000 folks living in vehicles.",35,,
212,0.97,1453.552,1458.657,I believe that to be another count.,35,,
213,0.97,1458.657,1463.728,We received an initial $1.9 million for site development to create safe parking.,35,,
214,0.97,1463.728,1477.809,We increased that potential award to $2.4 million using a to spend created by a provider Unfortunately going out of business.,35,,
215,0.97,1477.809,1485.417,"So, we, we have been, when contract migration began, we began reaching out to that particular provider.",35,,
216,0.97,1485.417,1487.686,Got zero response.,35,,
217,0.97,1487.686,1493.859,"Eventually through other means, found that they had shuttered.",35,,
218,0.97,1493.859,1508.073,"So, moved that allocation into this, out of recognition that this has historically been a area of significant understand and that the need is high across not just Seattle Metro, but the county as well.",35,,
219,0.97,1508.073,1513.879,The Timeline for this is that award should be made by the end of the month.,35,,
220,0.97,1513.879,1516.715,"So, the application deadline has passed.",35,,
221,0.97,1516.715,1519.885,Deliberation will begin shortly.,35,,
222,0.97,1519.885,1522.754,I can see Councilmember Herbold's hand.,35,,
223,0.97,1522.754,1524.356,Councilmember Herbold.,36,,
224,0.97,1524.356,1527.659,Thank you so much.,37,,
225,0.97,1527.659,1532.664,Understand that the applications period is closed.,37,,
226,0.97,1532.664,1540.772,"To the extent that you're able to answer this question, I would love to hear it, otherwise maybe taking the answer off--off-line.",37,,
227,0.97,1540.772,1558.623,I want to just say that I hope that the Rfp was written in a way that it also invited applicants to use the funds for storage of the RB's themselves.,37,,
228,0.97,1558.623,1570.635,In those instances where a provider is linking somebody who is living in an Rv to alternate housing options.,37,,
229,0.97,1570.635,1583.648,"In that, and knowing--the individual knowing there is a place to keep your Rv . that they will be potentially more likely to accept the alternative housing services.",37,,
230,0.97,1583.648,1593.425,"So, it's an alternate model to the management of an Rv safe lot with people living there.",37,,
231,0.97,1593.425,1607.238,"I just--I have been fighting this as an issue because as we know, people who live in Rvs don't consider themselves not to be homeless and are very, very reluctant to leave them behind.",37,,
232,0.97,1607.238,1617.949,"But yet, if there are alternatives, they might be more willing to take them if they know that their most valuable asset is going to be stored.",37,,
233,0.97,1617.949,1618.249,Yes.,38,,
234,0.97,1618.249,1619.918,"I appreciate that, Councilmember.",38,,
235,0.97,1619.918,1643.942,"To my knowledge, the procurement was written with pretty broad flexibility because again, recognizing that there has been--so we--we worked specifically with our vehicle Residency working group to craft, including a number of providers and folks living in vehicles, to craft the Rfp.",38,,
236,0.97,1643.942,1653.351,"My understanding is that it was written with quite a bit of flexibility, recognizing that people both providers and people with lived expertise need to be able to design the program that worked.",38,,
237,0.97,1653.351,1654.886,Including storage.,38,,
238,0.97,1654.886,1660.825,"So, we had--I have not reviewed these applications.",38,,
239,0.97,1660.825,1664.362,I'm not on this panel.,38,,
240,0.97,1664.362,1673.705,"But, internally I can say we had quite a bit of conversation about creating flexibility for programs to offer free or Low- cost repairs.",38,,
241,0.97,1673.705,1675.173,To store belongings.,38,,
242,0.97,1675.173,1679.778,To help people if they have multiple vehicles.,38,,
243,0.97,1679.778,1682.814,To help them consolidate.,38,,
244,0.97,1682.814,1699.764,"So, we really, at least on the program team here, had a really in-depth conversation about the breadth of flexibility necessary in order to be responsive to this Underserved population.",38,,
245,0.97,1699.764,1703.001,My hope is that the applications that the team is reviewing reflects that opportunity.,38,,
246,0.97,1703.001,1707.472,Thank you.,39,,
247,0.97,1707.472,1718.45,"I just want to note for Councilmember Herbold's questions, there's numerous places in the Rfp that do use inclusive language.",40,,
248,0.97,1718.45,1722.987,"It will say included, but not limited to, or services such as it's ever.",40,,
249,0.97,1722.987,1735.667,"The funds used in the Rfp as Councilmember Herbold would know best, because she sponsored this, says that at least some portion of the funds must be used on storage options.",40,,
250,0.97,1735.667,1742.44,"So, that is $400,000 of the $2.4 million now.",40,,
251,0.97,1742.44,1745.376,At least some portion to comply with the legislative intent would have that.,40,,
252,0.97,1745.376,1749.814,"Is not a proviso, it is a statement, but it does appear there is sufficient flexibility.",40,,
253,0.97,1749.814,1750.548,Thank you.,41,,
254,0.97,1750.548,1753.451,Thank you.,42,,
255,0.97,1753.451,1757.589,Are there any additional questions for this slide?,42,,
256,0.97,1757.589,1758.423,I don't see any.,42,,
257,0.97,1758.423,1759.958,I think we can continue.,42,,
258,0.97,1759.958,1760.658,Great.,43,,
259,0.97,1760.658,1767.432,Moving on to our high Acuity shelter partnership with King County.,43,,
260,0.97,1767.432,1773.705,The five-year sort of lease to my knowledge has been approved.,43,,
261,0.97,1773.705,1780.778,This preserves the existing 270 beds at salvation Army at what is called the Soto shelter.,43,,
262,0.97,1780.778,1784.349,A Noncognitive title that was also on that lot.,43,,
263,0.97,1784.349,1796.427,"It is going to add enhanced shelter and behavioral services for up to 150 additional folks, including 40 to 60 beds for folks with acute behavioral needs.",43,,
264,0.97,1796.427,1804.502,It will relocate a center that is currently three floors down from my office.,43,,
265,0.97,1804.502,1810.275,It will create new safe parking services for some folks living in Rvs.,43,,
266,0.97,1810.275,1820.151,"I don't believe that will be the totality of our safe parking investment to be clear, but one of the things we are interested in talking with Whoever the front runner is from the Rfp process.",43,,
267,0.97,1820.151,1829.26,"Can Re-Create some locations here to reduce costs, increase efficiency, help people access other forms of service?",43,,
268,0.97,1829.26,1843.141,"In particular, given the number of the intensity of vehicle related homelessness in South Seattle, having something like literally sort of pointed in that direction.",43,,
269,0.97,1843.141,1844.576,We can help people get to it.,43,,
270,0.97,1844.576,1847.846,We think it will be a little helpful.,43,,
271,0.97,1847.846,1865.23,Seattle has historically funded the Seattle salvation Army building.,43,,
272,0.97,1865.23,1878.309,Director and I and our teams have a series of meetings over the next several weeks to finalize some of the site planning and then much of this will also then roll into procurement shortly as well.,43,,
273,0.97,1878.309,1882.38,"Councilmember Morales, do you have a quick question?",44,,
274,0.97,1882.38,1883.848,Or a long one for that matter.,44,,
275,0.97,1883.848,1885.85,Thank you.,45,,
276,0.97,1885.85,1893.791,"So, can you tell me what it means that you are relocating the center?",45,,
277,0.97,1893.791,1897.629,Does that mean it is not going to be at the existing Soto site?,45,,
278,0.97,1897.629,1904.002,The site is currently in the building in the same building as my office.,46,,
279,0.97,1904.002,1905.603,It will move to the Soto site.,46,,
280,0.97,1905.603,1907.639,"Okay, I'm sorry.",47,,
281,0.97,1907.639,1908.706,The timing for that?,47,,
282,0.97,1908.706,1911.843,That is a question for the director.,48,,
283,0.97,1911.843,1916.281,We don't fund the center.,48,,
284,0.97,1916.281,1917.215,Yeah.,48,,
285,0.97,1917.215,1921.152,It is just we have discussed it moving to that site.,48,,
286,0.97,1921.152,1924.355,"Okay, thank you.",49,,
287,0.97,1924.355,1930.895,"Just as a follow-up on that too, this may be also a question for the director.",50,,
288,0.97,1930.895,1940.071,"Is it anticipated that there would be continuity of service in the relocation of the sobering center, in a similar capacity in the new location?",50,,
289,0.97,1940.071,1944.108,"That is my understanding, but that is a question for the director.",51,,
290,0.97,1944.108,1948.346,Thank you.,52,,
291,0.97,1948.346,1950.815,"Councilmember Morales, did you have a follow-up?",52,,
292,0.97,1950.815,1953.551,"Not right now, thank you.",53,,
293,0.97,1953.551,1955.887,"Okay, I think we can keep going.",54,,
294,0.97,1955.887,1957.522,Great.,55,,
295,0.97,1957.522,1971.636,"On the South end tiny home village that has been under question, so, we did identify Covid relief dollars that we can use to close the gap.",55,,
296,0.97,1971.636,1988.252,"The gap drops to $500,000 from some other figures . as a reminder, this proposal was ranked fourth in our competitive bidding process.",55,,
297,0.97,1988.252,1992.924,And did not include the information that the village was already built.,55,,
298,0.97,1992.924,1997.528,This slide is a little bit out of date.,55,,
299,0.97,1997.528,2006.904,We have identified a source of funds and have communicated with Miss Lee with regards to our ability to move forward with one-time funding.,55,,
300,0.97,2006.904,2018.616,The broader operational future of that village will need to be secured through ongoing operations and services support.,55,,
301,0.97,2018.616,2026.424,"Which, over the course of our budget conversations, with King County and the city of Seattle, we would help to identify.",55,,
302,0.97,2026.424,2029.394,Thank you.,56,,
303,0.97,2029.394,2043.708,I just want to jump in at this point and really think the Casey Rha for their creativity and flexibility in being able to work with the city and Lehigh and figuring out a way to get this asset Online.,56,,
304,0.97,2043.708,2056.554,Just want to state my personal commitment to work with the authority to identify that ongoing support or work through some of those potential issues.,56,,
305,0.97,2056.554,2060.691,"So, appreciate that this was able to effectively resolve.",56,,
306,0.97,2060.691,2070.735,"Do we know at this point, or is it a better question for L.E.H.I., when the village could be operational now that we have resolved the funding questions?",56,,
307,0.97,2070.735,2077.675,"I don't know, Councilmember, I'm sorry, chair.",57,,
308,0.97,2077.675,2085.75,"I've seen a couple different dates, so that might be a subsequent conversation.",57,,
309,0.97,2085.75,2091.889,"My understanding is that we are talking about weeks though, if not days.",57,,
310,0.97,2091.889,2097.995,"Great, that's good to know.",58,,
311,0.97,2097.995,2101.232,"I don't see any other questions, so I think we can keep going.",58,,
312,0.97,2101.232,2104.235,Great.,59,,
313,0.97,2104.235,2107.705,This slide is also a little bit out of date as of yesterday.,59,,
314,0.97,2107.705,2111.075,I apologize.,59,,
315,0.97,2111.075,2117.281,"The second chance, in our system what is called a project service agreement, has been executed.",59,,
316,0.97,2117.281,2119.484,"So, that is done.",59,,
317,0.97,2119.484,2127.658,"And to translate, does that basically mean this is in the provider's hands to get this accomplished at this point?",60,,
318,0.97,2127.658,2134.966,"Know, at this point the provider has completed all of the necessary budget information.",61,,
319,0.97,2134.966,2140.304,"We have executed the agreement with them, so the only thing that is next is for them to invoice.",61,,
320,0.97,2140.304,2141.639,"Great, Okay, good.",62,,
321,0.97,2141.639,2157.588,"I'll also just add, since we are in the public space, we are at about--this is probably changed since I last ran the numbers, which was Monday.",63,,
322,0.97,2157.588,2159.49,On Monday we were 75% contracts implemented.,63,,
323,0.97,2159.49,2163.261,It has probably gone up since then.,63,,
324,0.97,2163.261,2164.962,I will NOTE a couple things.,63,,
325,0.97,2164.962,2183.881,"One, the remaining contracts that are not implemented sit with a cluster of agencies who have pretty complex portfolios.",63,,
326,0.97,2183.881,2197.128,"So, there is quite a bit of work happening, but it is back and forth between the Rha and those agencies about like the various kinds of documentation that we need in order to have a clean audit, et cetera, et cetera.",63,,
327,0.97,2197.128,2203.367,"So, we expect having things wrapped up within the next week and a half I would say.",63,,
328,0.97,2203.367,2208.806,That is my goal.,63,,
329,0.97,2208.806,2217.715,"For what it's worth in this public setting, I just want to give a shout out to my team and to the providers' teams.",63,,
330,0.97,2217.715,2230.628,"When we began contract implementation in December, and sent out notices, there was no way that we could no that we were going to get hit with the Omicron surge.",63,,
331,0.97,2230.628,2236.601,Which wiped out the entire system's capacity to do anything other than respond to that for about a month and a half.,63,,
332,0.97,2236.601,2245.943,"We have all been working as fast as we can, and as diligently as we can, to get things implemented from behind that significant delay.",63,,
333,0.97,2245.943,2259.323,"Just a lot of appreciation for everyone on all sides necessary to get this huge body of work done so that folks are able to invoice, and the system can continue to support those who need its services.",63,,
334,0.97,2259.323,2266.163,"Up next, sister may advocate pure navigation.",64,,
335,0.97,2266.163,2269.9,A little bit of a Rebrand to.,64,,
336,0.97,2269.9,2271.802,Pure navigation is still the program model we are using.,64,,
337,0.97,2271.802,2281.946,"The folks who run that program have decided that they want to be known as system advocates, which I personally think is a really cool title.",64,,
338,0.97,2281.946,2288.185,"We have four Codirectors, each coming in with very distinct expertise.",64,,
339,0.97,2288.185,2296.427,The team has been conducting--has since begun to develop a logic model for their program.,64,,
340,0.97,2296.427,2301.032,"A more complete program model, policy, procedure, et cetera.",64,,
341,0.97,2301.032,2311.142,"We have a director who is beginning I believe this week, a director who is going to handle the operations specifically of this program.",64,,
342,0.97,2311.142,2329.393,"And they have been furiously interviewing for lead system advocates who will help manage teams, and then system advocates who will be parts of those teams.",64,,
343,0.97,2329.393,2333.13,I believe that offer letter should go out sometime in the next like weekend a half.,64,,
344,0.97,2333.13,2352.55,"So, my hope, that the Codirectors have assured me if possible, is that as we initially discussed around this program, we should have boots on the ground helping to connect people with things no later than the middle of June.",64,,
345,0.97,2352.55,2354.985,Councilmember Herbold.,65,,
346,0.97,2354.985,2356.721,Thanks.,66,,
347,0.97,2356.721,2366.43,"I just want to thank you, Ceo Dones, for getting back to me in response to questions I had.",66,,
348,0.97,2366.43,2390.688,"Last time you visited us specific to the partnership 40, I'm flagging this publicly because believe it or not, members of the public watch these meetings, and they sometimes will when they hear questions that they share, they will follow up and say Hey, what is the question answer?",66,,
349,0.97,2390.688,2396.293,"That is the case for that particular set of questions that I asked in March, and just want to thank you for getting those answers.",66,,
350,0.97,2396.293,2403.534,"I have not had a thorough chance to review them, but thank you.",66,,
351,0.97,2403.534,2407.037,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, and apologies.",67,,
352,0.97,2407.037,2411.642,"I will take public ownership, there was a delay.",67,,
353,0.97,2411.642,2417.748,"I'm happy to support, and if there are any follow-up questions, please let us know.",67,,
354,0.97,2417.748,2422.319,"Okay, I think we can continue along.",68,,
355,0.97,2422.319,2423.587,Great.,69,,
356,0.97,2423.587,2424.021,Briefly outreach.,69,,
357,0.97,2424.021,2434.732,"This has been I think broader outreach, this has been a subject of conversation in the community, and wanted to take a minute to chat in depth about it.",69,,
358,0.97,2434.732,2441.372,Our team has been working across the whole system to analyze how it is currently set up.,69,,
359,0.97,2441.372,2444.742,"Like what is working, not working.",69,,
360,0.97,2444.742,2450.714,I wanted today like some of our thinking around the outreach portion of the portfolio.,69,,
361,0.97,2450.714,2453.15,Offer some thoughts about where we might go.,69,,
362,0.97,2453.15,2462.259,"So, currently, we hold 17 outreach contracts.",69,,
363,0.97,2462.259,2466.263,"One serves folks, young people.",69,,
364,0.97,2466.263,2469.567,One serves folks with high Acuity.,69,,
365,0.97,2469.567,2479.076,"Three providers are sort of outreach specific, meaning they just like to outreach to Whoever is out there.",69,,
366,0.97,2479.076,2480.945,They can be deployed around the city.,69,,
367,0.97,2480.945,2487.551,There are three who are for marginalized folks.,69,,
368,0.97,2487.551,2492.923,There are 14 outreach providers that are centered around housing outcomes.,69,,
369,0.97,2492.923,2506.47,"So, what that means is that the current structure is that many outreach providers are branches of service that bridge to other project types.",69,,
370,0.97,2506.47,2514.111,They are not just a front door into the general support that the system can offer.,69,,
371,0.97,2514.111,2532.83,"So for example, a housing provider might have an outreach person who can help with connecting them with a narrower Subset of services like transitional housing, or rapid Rehousing, or diversion.",69,,
372,0.97,2532.83,2536.367,"But, maybe not all of the above.",69,,
373,0.97,2536.367,2558.722,"So, what we see then, is that like what we've got is this very different set of potential outcomes, structured frankly at the contract level, in terms of like what people are orienting towards, connecting people to.",69,,
374,0.97,2558.722,2593.257,"It's one of the reasons why when we talk about Geographics specific outreach, et cetera, one of the things that I think is underlying that is a recognition that our future system have to directly connect people with a myriad of support types, and that we can't have the sort of well, I can only connect you to other programs housed within the agency I am affiliated with essentially.",69,,
375,0.97,2593.257,2615.879,"So, what we are really going to be leaning into, and we are frankly going to do this around most of the system as we gear up to do again our five-year planning, and then also submit our necessary report to you all around was going to be in the system Rfp.",69,,
376,0.97,2615.879,2631.061,"We are going to do a number of requests for information for Rfi's, asking providers and other Nonprofits, to provide input on various sections of the system.",69,,
377,0.97,2631.061,2641.171,"So we will run an Rfi on outreach and shelter, and one on transitional and emergency housing, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.",69,,
378,0.97,2641.171,2646.877,Use a lot of that input in addition to our other community Stakeholder engagement to help structure what we think service redesign needs to be.,69,,
379,0.97,2646.877,2653.25,"Again, also to best furnish you all with the report that you requested.",69,,
380,0.97,2653.25,2663.127,"But, I wanted to walk through this, because this has been quite a bit of a topic lately as we talk about woodland or downtown core or other areas.",69,,
381,0.97,2663.127,2673.57,"I just wanted to surface some of what we see, and where we think we need to go.",69,,
382,0.97,2673.57,2675.873,Councilmember Herbold?,70,,
383,0.97,2675.873,2676.34,Thanks.,71,,
384,0.97,2676.34,2690.854,"On the outreach redesign, I know you have heard me say this before, but the Council has dedicated funding for specific geographic areas.",71,,
385,0.97,2690.854,2697.761,"Three Ftes to cover West Seattle, Bel-Ridge, South Park in the valley.",71,,
386,0.97,2697.761,2704.101,"Two Ftes to cover like city, and two Ftes to cover Northwest Seattle.",71,,
387,0.97,2704.101,2716.313,"I just want to flag again that I hope, as part of the redesign, that you also keep in mind the interest to maintain some geographic specificity.",71,,
388,0.97,2716.313,2722.986,"In outreach, in a way that is aligned with the Council's earlier budget decisions.",71,,
389,0.97,2722.986,2732.362,I also want to flag something that was in some response from Hsd after our last committee meeting.,71,,
390,0.97,2732.362,2740.671,As it relates to the work of our contracted outreach providers.,71,,
391,0.97,2740.671,2749.279,Some providers have elected to not provide shelter offers with connections on the day of encampment Removals.,71,,
392,0.97,2749.279,2765.863,"That apparently Hsd has asked you to modify those agencies contracts in a way that uses the city's funding to support individuals throughout the entire process, rather than just a portion of it.",71,,
393,0.97,2765.863,2768.332,Just interested to know how you are responding to that request from Hsd.,71,,
394,0.97,2768.332,2769.199,Thank you.,71,,
395,0.97,2769.199,2775.172,"Thank you, Councilmember.",72,,
396,0.97,2775.172,2783.814,So our--we have not entered into any conversation at this point around modifying contracts with providers.,72,,
397,0.97,2783.814,2797.995,What we are discussing at this point is working to support humane responses to folks that are Prioritized in Encampments.,72,,
398,0.97,2797.995,2813.744,"Our goal, in conversation with deputy Mayor Washington, and others, is to have a clear and broadly unified approach to Prioritize Asian.",72,,
399,0.97,2813.744,2817.548,"So like, which encampment and why.",72,,
400,0.97,2817.548,2831.695,"Being very clear about like if the concern is violence, that should, for good reason, jump us up in terms of where you are in the response Queue, for example.",72,,
401,0.97,2831.695,2855.652,"And, coordinating across the development, and holding of that Prioritization list, and that will allow us to deploy outreach teams to those sites that are Prioritized well in advance, and with clarity around shared clarity, around why we are there, and what the driving factors are.",72,,
402,0.97,2855.652,2858.155,That's what we are working on.,72,,
403,0.97,2858.155,2869.366,"I believe that Aligns with, based on my current conversation, I believe that Aligns with deputy Mayor Washington's understanding, although she is not here to offer correction.",72,,
404,0.97,2869.366,2876.173,Laughter] I believe she would hop on if she saw this and disagreed.,72,,
405,0.97,2876.173,2903.867,"To that end, what I will also say is like, part of this again links back into that issue of when we began to look at the structure of the outreach programming, the number of programs that were deployable actually was much smaller than the overall portfolio would lead you to believe.",72,,
406,0.97,2903.867,2910.807,That's the thing that I think we want to figure out how to correct.,72,,
407,0.97,2910.807,2923.754,"I also just want to affirm our agency has a real commitment to our sub regional planning work and downtown core were, like geographic work, and knowing the neighborhood.",72,,
408,0.97,2923.754,2931.895,"Knowing the people, is really important in this line of work.",72,,
409,0.97,2931.895,2941.905,"So, we wholeheartedly affirm and intend to carry forward and amplify the Council budget action around specific neighborhood based outreach.",72,,
410,0.97,2941.905,2945.876,Thank you.,73,,
411,0.97,2945.876,2953.65,I want to jump in and ask a question about the slide and how the future outreach system is designed.,74,,
412,0.97,2953.65,2959.656,"Or, envisioned as being designed.",74,,
413,0.97,2959.656,2991.521,"Where with the system navigation component, or the system advocate component be put into this? I have a conception of it given that the system advocates will be working with someone all the way through the process from outreach clear to being housed, but I just wonder if you could clarify like if there was a course--corresponding graphic addition that showed the system advocate role.",74,,
414,0.97,2991.521,2993.857,How would that kind of interact with this chart?,74,,
415,0.97,2993.857,2996.693,"Yeah, that's a great question, chair.",75,,
416,0.97,2996.693,3015.412,"From my perspective, the system advocates are not--they are--they are kind of outreach in that they have a toe in the outreach world in terms of where they might engage with folks.",75,,
417,0.97,3015.412,3021.184,"To your point because their work is longitudinal, it is more of a broader program.",75,,
418,0.97,3021.184,3043.273,"So like if I was going to Reconfigure this specific image that you are looking at to talk about system advocates, specifically, I think what I would be looking at is I would sort of Reconfigure it so it is like the little outreach.",75,,
419,0.97,3043.273,3050.247,"The little red person has a specific set of people who are like their people, right?",75,,
420,0.97,3050.247,3053.784,Like 10 to 15.,75,,
421,0.97,3053.784,3060.056,"Then, the stuff that they are connecting them to is actually broader than shelter housing and basic benefits.",75,,
422,0.97,3060.056,3071.868,"Because the system advocates, their role is to help people navigate all of the things, as opposed to these specific connections that outreach does to shelter or to housing.",75,,
423,0.97,3071.868,3090.487,"Really, like from a model principal, what outreach, as a function in many systems does, is served as the front door that helps people connect to an immediate let's get inside.",75,,
424,0.97,3090.487,3101.898,"What the system advocates' role is, is that maybe part of it, but it may also be about helping folks resolve criminal legal issues.",75,,
425,0.97,3101.898,3107.771,They can access different diversion resources.,75,,
426,0.97,3107.771,3110.407,They can help people connect with different kinds of food supports.,75,,
427,0.97,3110.407,3115.412,"Then, follow them along the way into housing placement and help stabilize them in housing placement.",75,,
428,0.97,3115.412,3125.689,"Currently, we only have like 1 1/2 providers who sit in that more longitudinal phase.",75,,
429,0.97,3125.689,3131.595,Reach being the one that folks are most familiar with.,75,,
430,0.97,3131.595,3138.235,The PDA to some degree employs a similar model with just care.,75,,
431,0.97,3138.235,3160.924,"So I think that what we recognized is that we need to have much more of that in the system, and we also need to have more straightforward dedicated outreach for when we are trying to take complex Encampments and help get people inside to bed placements rapidly.",75,,
432,0.97,3160.924,3164.461,Thank you for clarifying that.,76,,
433,0.97,3164.461,3165.495,No worries.,77,,
434,0.97,3165.495,3168.365,I think we can continue here.,78,,
435,0.97,3168.365,3172.602,That will conclude my presentation.,79,,
436,0.97,3172.602,3182.445,"Jeff, do you have any remarks now that the presentation is through?",80,,
437,0.97,3182.445,3185.215,For the record too it looks like we have been joined by Councilmember Mosqueda.,80,,
438,0.97,3185.215,3191.888,"For the record, I don't have additional comments.",81,,
439,0.97,3191.888,3194.791,"Marc, your staff and I clarify this before.",81,,
440,0.97,3194.791,3204.367,"Can you go into more detail for Councilmembers, we had a version issue with what Councilmembers received in advance and what they had today.",81,,
441,0.97,3204.367,3206.369,What they had talked about a system redesign and Rebid.,81,,
442,0.97,3206.369,3216.279,"What you talk about today, I think it would be helpful since this is a change from what the committee has heard previously to understand the Timeline and how this would go.",81,,
443,0.97,3216.279,3218.381,I apologize.,82,,
444,0.97,3218.381,3222.252,"In your packet, there was an out of date Timeline.",82,,
445,0.97,3222.252,3235.532,That was mistakenly inserted and corrected with the very helpful collaboration of Jonathan and Jacob.,82,,
446,0.97,3235.532,3242.973,That Referenced an earlier--I mean like November of last year.,82,,
447,0.97,3242.973,3246.443,Take on when we might do broad system Reprocurement.,82,,
448,0.97,3246.443,3270.634,"Between Omicron and contract delays, and organizational Standup and all that kind of stuff, and in conversation with both internally and then also with our provider community, we have decided to shift the way we will do the system Rebid to a phased Reprocurement.",82,,
449,0.97,3270.634,3276.273,We will we procure the system sort of stepwise.,82,,
450,0.97,3276.273,3282.679,Based off the five-year plan.,82,,
451,0.97,3282.679,3291.054,"Rooted in a lot of that community engagement work, and discussion that will come in through the Rfi's.",82,,
452,0.97,3291.054,3313.143,"So, frankly like this was just a--if we had tried to drive as aggressively as we had initially Conceptualized last year, I think it would have been sort of rushed to the point of breaking on some aspects.",82,,
453,0.97,3313.143,3331.528,"I think because the five-year plan is slated for September, there was also just some sort of like--some horses and some cards, and needing to put the horses in front of the carts.",82,,
454,0.97,3331.528,3344.074,"Really wanted to make sure that the five-year planning work was complete and was affirmed, and was pulling behind it then the Reprocurement.",82,,
455,0.97,3344.074,3350.146,"Jeff, does that answer provide all the clarification you were looking for?",83,,
456,0.97,3350.146,3353.216,"For sure, Yeah.",84,,
457,0.97,3353.216,3358.154,I think that I needed to affirm that to your colleagues on that answer.,84,,
458,0.97,3358.154,3360.623,I just wanted to make sure that was brought up.,84,,
459,0.97,3360.623,3363.827,We covered that when we were trying to get the materials repaired.,84,,
460,0.97,3363.827,3365.795,Great.,85,,
461,0.97,3365.795,3368.598,"Council colleagues, are there any additional questions for Ceo Dones?",85,,
462,0.97,3368.598,3372.969,Councilmember Mosqueda.,85,,
463,0.97,3372.969,3380.343,I was wondering if I could --,86,,
464,0.97,3380.343,3387.05,"You are muted, Councilmember Mosqueda.",87,,
465,0.97,3387.05,3393.59,Thanks again to Marc for the materials and the information that you provided.,88,,
466,0.97,3393.59,3402.198,"Marc, I'm wondering if as part of your presentation, if you already covered the safe lots and Rv storage.",88,,
467,0.97,3402.198,3407.337,"Initially when we had talked about safe lots, we talked about these being are be safe lots.",88,,
468,0.97,3407.337,3417.847,"And talking to some folks over the last few weeks, I think that the concept of having Rvs be the priority here is not necessarily how the Rfps are playing out.",88,,
469,0.97,3417.847,3431.027,"Could you give us a quick update on that, and apologies again if you have already covered that, but really hoping to hear more about the concept of getting more of those Rvs in place, especially if the 72 hour rule is to be changed in the future.",88,,
470,0.97,3431.027,3434.431,"Thanks, Councilmember Mosqueda.",89,,
471,0.97,3434.431,3435.298,I did cover this briefly.,89,,
472,0.97,3435.298,3450.713,"I will say that like so we constructed the Rfp in collaboration with our vehicle Residency working group, which includes a number of the providers working on vehicle homelessness.",89,,
473,0.97,3450.713,3453.817,As well as people experiencing homelessness with vehicles.,89,,
474,0.97,3453.817,3459.923,"It is constructed essentially with the wisdom of that group, and with maximum flexibility.",89,,
475,0.97,3459.923,3473.603,"So, what we have put out was within the guard rails of the community's best thinking, tell us what you've got.",89,,
476,0.97,3473.603,3479.309,"Offered flexibility for folks to think about Rv storage, to think about providing repairs for folks.",89,,
477,0.97,3479.309,3485.114,All kinds of different program models and approaches.,89,,
478,0.97,3485.114,3488.218,That Rfp is closed.,89,,
479,0.97,3488.218,3491.087,That committee has begun to review those proposals.,89,,
480,0.97,3491.087,3497.527,"I am not on it, and I can't speak, and wouldn't speak anyway to an active procurement process.",89,,
481,0.97,3497.527,3518.548,"So, I'm not sure what is in them but I will say that like, we, the Rfp itself does not limit just to Rvs or just two cars, it really was open for folks",89,,
482,0.97,3521.918,3529.792,"Do you have a follow-up, Councilmember Escada?",90,,
483,0.97,3529.792,3530.426,"I'm sorry, Ed.",91,,
484,0.97,3530.426,3533.863,I appreciate you asking Councilmember Mosqueda if she had a follow-up.,91,,
485,0.97,3533.863,3543.039,"She might have been thinking about it, because I just sent her an Email that I think might contradict what I just heard from you, Ceo Jones.",91,,
486,0.97,3543.039,3560.957,I have an excerpt from the Rp that specifically says passenger vehicles or cars are not part of this Rfp.,91,,
487,0.97,3561.624,3563.493,"Let me--again, I don't have --",92,,
488,0.97,3563.493,3580.443,"I sort of went down this rabbit hole because I heard there were some concerns about it being broader than Rvs, and there was some language in some places, like in the front page, that you both said Rvs, car Rvs, you mentioned vehicles and it doesn't have the word, recreational.",93,,
489,0.97,3580.443,3596.359,"Christine in my office, probably assisted by Jeff, actually provided the language from the Rfp itself that specifically says that it is not for passenger vehicles or cars.",93,,
490,0.97,3596.359,3598.061,Okay.,94,,
491,0.97,3598.061,3603.499,"I mean, let me follow up.",94,,
492,0.97,3603.499,3619.916,"If, like I have no reason to doubt that's what it says, my thought would be that that was then what the vehicle Residency working group said, like this is where they wanted to put their focus.",94,,
493,0.97,3619.916,3626.99,Because I wasn't directly part of that.,94,,
494,0.97,3626.99,3629.092,"Also with the funding, what our funding intent was.",95,,
495,0.97,3629.092,3630.36,Because we've gone through this before.,95,,
496,0.97,3630.36,3634.797,We've allocated funds for Rv safe lot many years ago and the Mayor's office used it for a passenger vehicle thing.,95,,
497,0.97,3634.797,3645.008,Got it.,96,,
498,0.97,3649.078,3650.346,We've been through this road before.,97,,
499,0.97,3650.346,3653.249,We did everything we could to make it very specific what our intent was.,97,,
500,0.97,3653.249,3668.931,"So then, it may be--apologies, this is probably just me not tracking this as closely as I need to, amongst 1000 other things, so then, if that is the case, then my suspicion is, and this is maybe what Jeff was coming to confirm, my suspicion was my staff likely followed your intent on driving towards that specificity.",98,,
501,0.97,3668.931,3672.969,But it may be that I need to check in with my team on this to provide a fuller answer.,98,,
502,0.97,3672.969,3681.411,Do you have something to add there?,99,,
503,0.97,3681.411,3682.679,"Yes, thank you, Mr. chair.",100,,
504,0.97,3682.679,3690.253,"I'll just note that the language in the Rfp regularly uses the phrase in, and I'll quote, recreational vehicles, Rvs or other Oversized vehicles that have been converted into living quarters, like buses, vans, or trucks.",100,,
505,0.97,3690.253,3712.442,And it goes on with passenger vehicles or cars are not part of this Rfp.,100,,
506,0.97,3712.442,3715.611,I think the confusion likely lies in the Oversized vehicles that could be converted.,100,,
507,0.97,3715.611,3717.947,There is a degree that we are not just talking about Rvs.,100,,
508,0.97,3717.947,3721.35,"There is some Fungibility and what could be incorporated, but it is generally something larger.",100,,
509,0.97,3721.35,3724.12,"So that language is repeatedly used, and I felt like it was rather specific.",100,,
510,0.97,3724.12,3729.492,"It seems like a good time to note that earlier, when I indicated that storage is included, storage is never explicitly highlighted in the Rfp.",100,,
511,0.97,3729.492,3732.628,"There is always broad, Open- ended language of the type of services that could be proposed.",100,,
512,0.97,3732.628,3737.033,"So I assume that's an area where the evaluation of proposals would come in, to make sure that was done.",100,,
513,0.97,3737.033,3742.905,Those are the two things that the Rfp reads.,100,,
514,0.97,3742.905,3744.607,Counselor Mosqueda.,101,,
515,0.97,3744.607,3757.186,"In terms of the legislative intent of Councilmember her bold, thank you, we offer to check in with your team and get back to us.",102,,
516,0.97,3757.186,3783.846,"I think that part of the desire is what would be deciding the locations or probably if you are still looking for locations and encouraging people to apply so that we are talking about a large enough space for these vehicles, whether they are in Rv or a bus or a small delivery vehicle that's been converted to an Rv.",102,,
517,0.97,3783.846,3790.92,Many folks throughout the city have seen these types of vehicles.,102,,
518,0.97,3790.92,3797.627,"If I ever were to find myself helpless I believe that's where I would prefer to live, as well.",102,,
519,0.97,3797.627,3800.63,"Knowing that there's a roof and a door, and a place to securely be.",102,,
520,0.97,3800.63,3828.558,"So I perfectly understand why some folks may want to stay in that vehicle, but having a safer place to be with access to services or hygiene is ideal, and then as Councilmember her bold noted and led in the budgeting, there is housing available, so that storage is there, so thank you for following on that, especially the folks who are living in vehicles like that.",102,,
521,0.97,3828.558,3830.393,"I do have two more questions, if I might.",102,,
522,0.97,3830.393,3831.627,Please go ahead.,103,,
523,0.97,3831.627,3839.535,Sorry to cut you off.,104,,
524,0.97,3839.535,3859.155,"Question about sort of this--not necessarily the vision that you outlined, I appreciate the update on where you're at in terms of hiring and the notification that will go out to the person who can help us make sure there is coordinated systems for navigating.",105,,
525,0.97,3859.155,3873.502,"Also appreciate there is some sort of analysis on whether or not the program was ready to go and out the door as soon as folks wanted it to, and this question about cart before the horse, especially as you think about your 5/6 year plan.",105,,
526,0.97,3873.502,3878.941,Úi wanted to ask if there was any up date that we might be able to provide to folks who are calling and writing in.,105,,
527,0.97,3878.941,3909.438,"I think as we noted, many of the hot spots are maybe fewer than people would think, but some of those Hotspots and the concerns coming up from residents who are calling either us or other folks within the city is not knowing who to call, and we talked a little bit about this last time with deputy Mayor Washington, that one point of contact.",105,,
528,0.97,3909.438,3922.485,"And at the time, I think deputy Mayor Washington was like I'm going to help out within the city, but do you have any updates for us on where we should be directing folks if they see a concern, if they see someone having a mental health crisis or might be in need of an outreach worker of any type?",105,,
529,0.97,3922.485,3937.967,"Because we all don't want to be trying to make assessments of what a person needs in the moment, and would love to be able to call a number, and Ideally that number is not 911, because we are reaching out to folks before that will be a crisis.",105,,
530,0.97,3937.967,3951.947,"All right, so far crisis stuff, that's still, I think, a conversation, just to be candid.",106,,
531,0.97,3951.947,3963.926,"If you see someone who is Decompensating, and who to call, the best thing to do at this point, if you are in Seattle Metro, is still, I believe, based on frankly what I have done, is to call 911 and specifically request health line, because you are not asking for a law enforcement response.",106,,
532,0.97,3963.926,3965.528,You are asking for a health response.,106,,
533,0.97,3965.528,3967.963,You describe what you are seeing and you request health line.,106,,
534,0.97,3967.963,3985.147,"On the broader question of what to see, I believe, and I apologize for Couching this this way, because I really did not want to speak on the behalf of deputy Mayor Washington, but I believe the city has a public facing way to say, Hey, it is an encampment form, I'm seeing this troubling thing.",106,,
535,0.97,3985.147,3986.048,That information is shared.,106,,
536,0.97,3986.048,3989.685,"So we do receive a dates out of that, as well.",106,,
537,0.97,3989.685,4004.667,And then I work with our team to assess what we can deploy in order to help coordinate a response across all of the folks that have resources to bear.,106,,
538,0.97,4004.667,4015.578,"I think, and the chair, chair Lewis and I had some conversation about this.",106,,
539,0.97,4015.578,4034.096,I think that there is still a robust conversation to have about what is the crisis response when someone is experiencing acute psychiatric distress?,106,,
540,0.97,4034.096,4038.868,"The authority, just to be candid, this is where the conversation is.",106,,
541,0.97,4038.868,4044.407,"We have some role there but not everyone experiencing stress is experiencing homelessness, right?",106,,
542,0.97,4044.407,4071.333,"So I think that is a space where we really want to support and we also want to be cognizant of what our role and Lane is, and how to Choreograph that with the Lector floor, with interim director Kim.",106,,
543,0.97,4071.333,4080.509,That's something I think we are really open to the conversation on.,106,,
544,0.97,4080.509,4095.825,"We know that we need to be providing, as we all discussed at length now, the high Acuity shelter beds, the things that are again for people experiencing homelessness, that also have the specific needs.",106,,
545,0.97,4095.825,4111.073,I think there is a question about how to set up a broader apparatus that could respond to any acute psychiatric need that we saw anywhere in the Seattle Metro area.,106,,
546,0.97,4111.073,4114.844,"Is that helpful, Councilmember?",106,,
547,0.97,4114.844,4116.378,I'm not trying to Dodge the question.,106,,
548,0.97,4116.378,4131.093,"I'm just trying to elevate where we are stuck, from a roles perspective, and where we think there is collaboration that needs to happen.",106,,
549,0.97,4131.26,4132.795,"Oh, there you are.",106,,
550,0.97,4132.795,4143.139,Can you hear me?,107,,
551,0.97,4145.04,4156.819,"Perhaps Councilmember Mosqueda, turning the visual off might assist.",108,,
552,0.97,4161.157,4161.924,"Oh, I see.",109,,
553,0.97,4161.924,4162.758,I don't know.,110,,
554,0.97,4162.758,4163.626,"Sure, sure, sure.",111,,
555,0.97,4163.626,4164.927,"Okay, let me give that a shot.",111,,
556,0.97,4164.927,4166.061,Can you hear me now?,111,,
557,0.97,4166.061,4166.462,Yes.,112,,
558,0.97,4166.462,4174.069,"Okay, great, and I will switch devices, as well.",113,,
559,0.97,4174.069,4174.937,I think it's helpful.,113,,
560,0.97,4174.937,4176.005,Thank you for the answer.,113,,
561,0.97,4176.005,4207.369,"I think internal to the city, when we get a request or people see a Concerningthing happening perhaps in an and Kamman, specifically an encampment or an individual just outside elements and folks writing us and wanting to give them assistance, it sounds like the best solution at this point internal to the city, is to fill out that request form that has been sent, and I know we've been putting that in our hot topic responses and sharing that out.",113,,
562,0.97,4207.369,4211.106,Sometimes that's not a very satisfactory response to the folks who are writing us or calling us.,113,,
563,0.97,4211.106,4217.813,"So I just want to double check with the Timeline is for when a request gets in, when a request gets in and how fast it gets to you.",113,,
564,0.97,4217.813,4232.795,"So if I see someone, who for example, looks like they may need not just housing support, but might need a whole host of other services, if I write in, how fast might that get to you all?",113,,
565,0.97,4232.795,4233.896,That's a good question.,114,,
566,0.97,4233.896,4245.507,"We share information routinely with the unified care team, the set up that deputy Mayor Washington runs.",114,,
567,0.97,4245.507,4246.742,My staff attended that meeting.,114,,
568,0.97,4246.742,4255.417,"So if things come in through a city based portal and then get indexed in that meeting, my staff become aware of it as the same time as the city staff do.",114,,
569,0.97,4255.417,4263.459,"If you know there is some other Triaging that happens, it would then come to us later in the same way that it would come to other city staff later.",114,,
570,0.97,4263.459,4271.967,"We are really trying to link arms and walk on this one, so we are all getting the same information at the same time.",114,,
571,0.97,4271.967,4287.516,"To be candid, I do not want to speak on behalf of Csb and how they move that data, because that is not a thing that I am Privy to, or part of.",114,,
572,0.97,4287.516,4289.284,We become aware of it in that meeting now.,114,,
573,0.97,4289.284,4290.719,So I'll follow up on that.,115,,
574,0.97,4290.719,4295.057,"Do you have ache follow-up, Councilmember Mosqueda?",115,,
575,0.97,4295.057,4318.047,"I'm hoping that we might be able to get follow-up from the city, as well, because a folks are writing and saying here is someone at this intersection, if this doesn't get to you all in a timely way, or for folks, if that doesn't get to you in a timely way, then are we missing an opportunity for credible outreach?",116,,
576,0.97,4318.047,4319.748,We'll follow-up as well but thanks for the answer.,116,,
577,0.97,4319.748,4324.453,"I had a related responsible Councilmember Mosqueda just said, that it's the best Conduit for information, the unified care team.",117,,
578,0.97,4324.453,4338.701,"In the city, is that who we should be notifying, and then that in turn triggers some kind of response from the authority?",117,,
579,0.97,4338.701,4344.173,"For right now, I think that is the fastest way because that's where we are all meeting to triage and move information and resources.",118,,
580,0.97,4344.173,4349.178,"Land to be clear, like those meetings are twice a week.",118,,
581,0.97,4349.178,4359.488,"So it's not like Oh, we meet quarterly on it.",118,,
582,0.97,4359.488,4373.068,"It is a significant amount of time and a significant amount of folks are coming together multiple times a week, and then working in essentially subgroups to then drive action out of those meetings.",118,,
583,0.97,4373.068,4380.709,So that's where I would direct people right now.,118,,
584,0.97,4380.709,4393.422,"The authority as part of our broader Countywide stop is going to set up some form of give us your information, whether it is a portal or a Hotline.",118,,
585,0.97,4393.422,4400.729,Actually I'm not clear yet if it is both.,118,,
586,0.97,4400.729,4410.939,Obviously Hotlines need to be staffed and that is an operations consideration for us right now.,118,,
587,0.97,4410.939,4421.95,"I think we'll look to sort of analyze how are people currently communicating, shockingly.",118,,
588,0.97,4421.95,4423.685,I receive a lot of communication.,118,,
589,0.97,4423.685,4477.306,"And much of it comes directly from constituents, but then we also receive a lot of communication coming from a whole bunch of different city and county departments in all 39 cities and from the county, and I think what we need to do at the authority is begin to build out the future system direction, is look at how we can, as much as possible, see where that communication is coming from, and then figure out how to port it all into either one place, either an easy way that government Backend can move whatever the request is, over, or if we are directing people to something that is an authority, front door, where again, you can just come and ask us directly.",118,,
590,0.97,4477.306,4478.807,"Thanks for that break down, mark.",119,,
591,0.97,4478.807,4520.215,"One thing I might flag at this point, too, is I really do think at this point in the year, and given that the unified care team is a bigger part of the city's work in this, I just want to flag my committee clerk and Jeff Sims, it probably would be good to get the unified care team to come in as the subject of a committee session, to learn a little bit more about that work, and where we are with that, and how it integrates in the KC Rha.",119,,
592,0.97,4520.215,4523.485,"Obviously open invitation to Casey Rha to participate in that hearing, if that makes sense.",119,,
593,0.97,4523.485,4526.521,"I imagine it would, so we can just get everyone in one place.",119,,
594,0.97,4526.521,4527.456,I have a related question.,119,,
595,0.97,4527.456,4530.192,"I think, I suspect it will involve coordination with the unified care team.",119,,
596,0.97,4530.192,4569.998,"But I wanted to ask because increasingly the human services Department that I see Councilmember her block's question, maybe it's a similar question, let's see, I know human services Department is he relaying, is that folks are telling people in Encampments to go and congregate in spaces, like mutual aid volunteers and others, are telling people to go and camp in places that are more likely to have outreach and services offered.",119,,
597,0.97,4569.998,4590.185,"So for example, woodland Park, which is in the news a lot, and an area of focus for the city, downtown Seattle is the designated partnership 40 area Chinatown and international district being very active there.",119,,
598,0.97,4590.185,4599.795,What are some of the strategies we are working on to prevent that kind of a concentration of people seeking assistance?,119,,
599,0.97,4599.795,4609.371,"It's a very hard thing to plan around and one we've talked about, what's the sort of current status of that?",119,,
600,0.97,4609.371,4617.646,"I would say that I don't want to overstate, chair, like it is discussed.",120,,
601,0.97,4617.646,4619.414,I wouldn't say there is planning that's been done.,120,,
602,0.97,4619.414,4654.583,"And I think some of this will be planned around in our actual five-year plan work around what does it mean to invest in the appropriate Resourcing of neighborhoods and communities, et cetera, so that people are able to access things where they're at as opposed to having to migrate from South County to Seattle, or from woodland park to downtown.",120,,
603,0.97,4654.583,4660.655,In order to get access to something.,120,,
604,0.97,4660.655,4663.859,And that has to be part of how we talk about bringing the system to scale.,120,,
605,0.97,4663.859,4675.771,"And some of that, to Councilmember her bold's earlier point, was a real focus on neighborhood by neighborhood tactics, and both that the outreach level and at the bed level.",120,,
606,0.97,4675.771,4704.699,"We do need to think about how we get creative in terms of the creation of new assets for folks and I don't want to speak to out of hand, but if approved on some of the proposals in the FY 22 budget that the KC Rha is putting forward, are about more places for people to be.",120,,
607,0.97,4704.699,4712.34,That's the underlying issue here and we need to drive that change.,120,,
608,0.97,4712.34,4719.748,Thank you for clarifying that.,121,,
609,0.97,4719.748,4725.62,"I totally wasn't expecting the perfect answer, that this is all figured out.",121,,
610,0.97,4725.62,4726.288,It is very complicated.,121,,
611,0.97,4726.288,4730.892,Definitely going to be patient with figuring out how we can make a more comprehensive system.,121,,
612,0.97,4730.892,4735.664,"So I appreciate the honesty of that answer, and we'll continue to be partners on that.",121,,
613,0.97,4735.664,4736.298,Councilmember her bold?,121,,
614,0.97,4736.298,4775.837,"Just following up, chair Lewis, two your, I think very timely discussion of having the unified care team present at a future meeting, I think many of us, since the creation of the hope team, have been struggling and asking over and over in these meetings how the city is privatizing locations that they feel should be priorities for Removals, and we're just not getting information about that.",122,,
615,0.97,4775.837,4804.599,"As recently as the document that you sent, chair Lewis, prior to this meeting, answering questions from the March meeting, Hsd, in response to our question about how locations have Prioritized--what Encampments are Prioritized in a Timeline.",122,,

707,0.97,5465.426,5473.801,"We piloted our new, Consolidated associated recreation Council budget process last year.",140,,
708,0.97,5473.801,5514.041,"Recreation facilities hosted public fitness programs with funding that focused on a systems wide level, rather than a solo site level, so that programs in neighborhoods with the highest equity and priority populations index score, otherwise known for short, E PPI score, had a budget that was partially subsidized by the sites and neighborhoods with a lower E PPI score, and those with a lower E PPI score were expected to bring in additional revenue to support other sites.",140,,
709,0.97,5514.041,5522.683,A final report is forthcoming with an evaluation of the overall impacts of this new budget model.,140,,
710,0.97,5522.683,5546.674,"A challenge of this new model was Transitioning from staff used two holding onto their site revenues to an understanding how this redistribution of resources supports equitable programs--or excuse me, supports equitable access to programs, to more people.",140,,
711,0.97,5546.674,5549.443,"Next slide, please.",140,,
712,0.97,5549.443,5556.617,So B Referenced wreck in the streets just a moment ago.,140,,

714,0.97,5571.132,5590.451,The pilot of 2018 to extend recreational opportunities to neighborhoods in equity zones blossomed to being a source of relief and a Balm for health and wellness during the height of the pandemic.,140,,
715,0.97,5590.451,5616.577,"The impact is documented by the ample amounts of feedback from community members, of what the outdoor activities meant to them, and I'm going to reference a message from a mom named Jessica, and her NOTE reads, rocky hasn't missed a day of Rec in the streets.",140,,
716,0.97,5616.577,5619.613,That says it all about how we feel about Rec in the streets.,140,,
717,0.97,5619.613,5625.519,"As a mother of a special needs child, the teams we have gone to have been very accommodating, kind, sweet, and understanding.",140,,
718,0.97,5625.519,5634.261,"A challenge for this program has been the instability of staffing, funding, and mobility.",140,,
719,0.97,5634.261,5663.624,"What would be of benefit is long-term investment to support and sustain the compassionate, skilled recreation staff of Rec in the streets, a fleet of electric vans, and their objective to serve as many people as they are able over the longest period of time, and in particular, neighborhoods in equity zones.",140,,
720,0.97,5663.624,5663.924,Thank you.,140,,
721,0.97,5663.924,5666.727,"Next slide, please, and I'm passing it on to my colleague, Tricia Diaz.",140,,
722,0.97,5666.727,5667.328,"Thanks, Belinda.",141,,
723,0.97,5667.328,5688.382,"So I will present two of our Impactful service equity projects, and the first was with the park's trails.",141,,
724,0.97,5688.382,5692.953,And one of the obstacles of the project was the lack of current data of the trial system and their condition.,141,,
725,0.97,5692.953,5696.424,So the first step was to map all the trails with the arc GIS mapping system.,141,,
726,0.97,5696.424,5707.034,"And then that enabled us to add data from the racial and social equity composite index, which as many of you know, it contains three layers of maps.",141,,
727,0.97,5707.034,5709.737,"And then, to identify the trails and the Trailheads in Underserved communities.",141,,
728,0.97,5709.737,5719.78,"So all the mapping and the data help us do that, and identify areas that needed service in those communities.",141,,
729,0.97,5719.78,5735.029,"So we considered those locations and how they connect schools, bus lines, amenities, so then we dedicated resources to put towards clearing, improvement, special safety pruning, and best management practices, to promote a thriving Ecosystem in the trails system.",141,,
730,0.97,5735.029,5749.243,"So the outcome provided through the safety and use of the trails, and access to the Trailheads in these vulnerable communities.",141,,
731,0.97,5749.243,5752.079,"So in addition to the lack of data, there were other challenges.",141,,
732,0.97,5752.079,5771.298,"Staff shortages exist, and we had a small crew compared to the trails system, so we relied on program volunteers and other crews for assistance to meet the 2021 goals of clearing five Trailheads and 1440 Lynn a repeat of trails.",141,,
733,0.97,5771.298,5786.48,"And another Challengewas the numerous citizen requests received from the hiring for neighborhoods, where there is fewer requests placed by areas of higher need.",141,,
734,0.97,5786.48,5791.652,"So we have a Demand-Based work order system, so we had to override their request system and manually identify these areas of greatest need.",141,,
735,0.97,5791.652,5813.407,"So next slide, please . So a second service equity project is our Treeplanting program, and the current 2 for 1 Treeplanting budget does not provide enough money to fill the existing needs or the goal to reach a net 03 loss.",141,,
736,0.97,5813.407,5823.384,So the 200 year Olmstead Commemoration came up and the friends of Olmstead park volunteers saw an opportunity to solicit additional funding to add trees.,141,,
737,0.97,5823.384,5838.966,"So the project started and the parks hired the Burger partnership to identify areas of tree loss in the city, in parks and Underserved communities.",141,,
738,0.97,5838.966,5856.05,"So the contractor used the current tree data and layered information for additional maps, the heat index map and the racial and social justice index maps that we mentioned.",141,,
739,0.97,5856.05,5861.088,And then they identified locations in Underserved communities with a high heat index due to the lack of sufficient tree canopy.,141,,
740,0.97,5861.088,5864.925,"So along with the primary goal to plant additional trees, there are targets and benefits which also address the challenges.",141,,
741,0.97,5864.925,5882.943,"So one being improved heat index in Underserved communities, and this is going to be done through soliciting corporate Sponsorships to help fund additional trees and expand the tree canopy in those areas.",141,,
742,0.97,5882.943,5894.788,And two is encouraging community partnerships through a new tree watering program that will engage the public and it will also alleviate the high cost of watering the new trees.,141,,
743,0.97,5894.788,5900.661,"And finally is creating apprenticeship positions, which are parks job pathways, but they're targeted and open to citizens in the communities.",141,,
744,0.97,5900.661,5901.528,"So next slide, please.",141,,

748,0.97,5933.427,5936.163,So we've highlighted a few of those equity analysis tools that we utilize.,142,,
749,0.97,5936.163,5938.866,"Either they were developed in 2021, or they received some level of refinement.",142,,
750,0.97,5938.866,5949.61,"This included the SPR equity impact filter, which is utilized at the beginning of decision-making and program and service delivery, so that we know we are leading with Embedding equity considerations in our decision-making.",142,,
751,0.97,5949.61,5966.327,"What the strategic action plan, the process of developing the strategic action plan included many equity considerations and equity principles that were embedded into process.",142,,
752,0.97,5966.327,5985.346,"The budget analysis tool was utilized in 2021, as well as the GIS and low equity mapping tool, which actually exists as a mobile App as well as Desktop, to Prioritize Decision- making for service delivery, primarily in our parks and environment, and also facilities divisions.",142,,
753,0.97,5985.346,5996.59,"And also, capital project equity fire taxation and also, equity considerations which we will talk a little bit more about.",142,,

763,0.97,6089.716,6096.49,This slide that you see here is a front cover page of our our Sj report this year.,145,,
764,0.97,6096.49,6112.439,"As Christopher mentioned, the our Sj initiative is about 20 years old and it was started with the founder by the name of Glenn Harris, who was Seattle office of civil rights manager back then.",145,,
765,0.97,6112.439,6117.711,"He went on to start the government alliance of race and equity, which is called here.",145,,
766,0.97,6117.711,6121.849,It's a national organization now.,145,,
767,0.97,6121.849,6129.423,The change team used an equity tool from this organization's platform to put our ideas into action.,145,,
768,0.97,6129.423,6144.371,"On the slide you'll see an outline of the strategic Workplan which has both quantitative and qualitative data to highlight our accomplishments, which you'll see on the next page.",145,,
769,0.97,6144.371,6152.846,"And doing this work, the central question is, is anyone better off from the accomplishments that we've seen?",145,,
770,0.97,6152.846,6161.021,Next slide.,145,,
771,0.97,6161.021,6161.889,So is anyone better off?,145,,
772,0.97,6161.889,6163.39,What impacts do these accomplishments have?,145,,
773,0.97,6163.39,6165.092,Our Workplan had an internal focus for 2021.,145,,
774,0.97,6165.092,6172.466,Change team did take the responsibility of delivering training and opportunities to gather and spaces to enhance our Sj learning with and for the workforce.,145,,
775,0.97,6172.466,6176.837,"So to highlight a few, last year we got a pulse on the growth of affinity and equity committees internally.",145,,
776,0.97,6176.837,6188.916,"In 2017, there were three total groups.",145,,
777,0.97,6188.916,6190.184,In 2021 we identified 13.,145,,
778,0.97,6190.184,6197.758,"Identifying who are the leads of these spaces, their mission, and disseminating the contact Informaton as a tangible resource of others to join, per their interest, and enhance visibility for these groups.",145,,
779,0.97,6197.758,6204.331,The change team was just as convenience for this information.,145,,
780,0.97,6204.331,6210.27,Individuals took leadership roles to making the growth happen.,145,,
781,0.97,6210.27,6237.497,"Another accomplishment that we want to highlight is the change team, the investment of 150 K for the change team budget, each city has, each Department has a change team and whether or not there is dedicated or undedicated funds depends on the Department, but having a dedicated budget does put some parameters regarding the change teams and how we spend our time.",145,,
782,0.97,6237.497,6252.98,"It also lends to some creativity on training opportunities, special events and ideas on how to recruit members to join for the change team.",145,,
783,0.97,6252.98,6264.424,There has been notable change for equity committees and positions across the nation.,145,,
784,0.97,6264.424,6273.7,Right now there is definitely an Uptick of investment in the body of work of Rsj and the compensation of this work.,145,,
785,0.97,6273.7,6281.174,Next slide . Here are our challenges.,145,,
786,0.97,6281.174,6294.688,So the diagram on the left shows--is a diagram from the Seattle office of civil rights that shows the learning and vocabulary of the four levels of racism.,145,,
787,0.97,6294.688,6305.999,"In the conversation about challenges, trying to understand which, where the challenges live, helps to provide some direction on how to overcome them.",145,,
788,0.97,6305.999,6314.174,"Structural means, history, Institutionally practiced policies and procedures, and interpersonal is prejudice and bias is.",145,,
789,0.97,6314.174,6340.801,"Based on the engagement of the change and feedback of the workforce, the themes that we were able to identify was workplace culture, changing recruitment and capacity, system of accountability, alignment of Rsj roles and work and advocating for safe and healthy--safety and health.",145,,
790,0.97,6340.801,6350.277,This diagram on the right shows where they lie within the four levels of racism.,145,,
791,0.97,6350.277,6350.744,Next slide.,145,,
792,0.97,6350.744,6351.144,All right.,145,,
793,0.97,6351.144,6359.152,So we also wanted to take the time to highlight foundations of change for 2021.,145,,
794,0.97,6359.152,6369.396,Foundation of change began in 2018 to center SPR to Antiracist principles.,145,,
795,0.97,6369.396,6393.353,"In 2019 we introduced the city's leadership expectation and accountability plan as well as Pathway to equity, to the leadership team, to integrate the Foundational Antiracist principles, and in 2020 we took the opportunity to be intentional in our planning, to develop our Rsj applied learning and growth opportunities for 2021 and beyond.",145,,
796,0.97,6393.353,6411.104,"So foundation of change saw a shift in 2021, and it became a training and development model that was shifted to weekly Rsj training and knowledge building with monthly Facilitation designed for all staff and led by our executive team members.",145,,
797,0.97,6411.104,6430.49,"So in this next slide, you'll see some data again, and just feedback and engagement from SPR employees of Gauging the employee experience with foundations of change.",145,,
798,0.97,6430.49,6439.699,"On the left you see the overall program and the categories within the overall program scoring, and as you see, mainly good and some fair there with employee rating.",145,,
799,0.97,6439.699,6447.941,"With weekly lessons, 45% showed a satisfied rate, 37% very satisfied.",145,,
800,0.97,6447.941,6453.98,"And also, you see the rating on the Antiracist continue them.",145,,
801,0.97,6453.98,6473.6,"We came in at about 3.8 for the Department, which is moving from that place of being symbolic change, a compliance Department, to moving into identity change and being affirming, and an agency that is truly working towards developing and Antiracist identity.",145,,
802,0.97,6473.6,6482.742,"Much work still to be done, however, still wanted to give you an idea of that rating.",145,,
803,0.97,6482.742,6526.353,"In the spirit of our Sj I, manifested through a commitment backed by developing resources and implementing those resources towards undoing and eliminating, seeking to work and undo and eliminate barriers to communication flow and access to information, the which is still ongoing, Ed, developing entry points for all staff to inform decision-making and to be aware of decisions as they are being made, particularly by those who will be most affected by most decisions.",146,,
804,0.97,6526.353,6537.23,Some highlighted examples of that are all staff meetings that are held monthly and they're at Department level as well as a division level.,146,,
805,0.97,6537.23,6608.368,"We have our SPR Carotene and wellness resources, which is led by our hr team, and the care team really centers in and focuses on supporting the whole employee by addressing employee needs through timely resources, support, and communication, as well as our change team and division equity leads, supportive affinity groups, and division equity teams, and growing and developing, establishing these groups . and as well as--I'll wrap it up here with looking forward, I mentioned early with our 2022 line of business, equity tool kits, we plan to start a multi- gear process this year of conducting line of business equity Toolkits, to ensure we are being intentional about how we are providing programs, services and decision-making and ensure that they are rooted in Antiracism and equity.",146,,
806,0.97,6608.368,6616.209,"And there is where we will wrap it up at this point, bringing questions and insight.",146,,
807,0.97,6616.209,6618.612,Thank you so much for this great and thorough presentation.,147,,
808,0.97,6618.612,6623.083,I'll open it up first to colleagues.,147,,
809,0.97,6623.083,6628.488,"There, Councilmember Morales, please.",147,,
810,0.97,6628.488,6635.862,Thank you everybody for this presentation.,148,,
811,0.97,6635.862,6661.988,"I'm really excited to hear there is so much work happening with the Department, not just within your lines of business, and how you serve community, but internal work happening, and I do think this last slide, the identifying change that's needed is an important place to acknowledge that the Department has work to do and to really be intentional about figuring out what that work is, so that our city family gets what they need to be supported.",148,,
812,0.97,6661.988,6670.196,I do want to go to a couple of the early slides.,148,,
813,0.97,6670.196,6693.52,"On slide for you talk about athletic fields being 10 fields having Drop-In play available, and the consolidated budgeting pilot, which I think is very interesting and exciting, and the racks in the street.",148,,
814,0.97,6693.52,6709.469,"Those three slides are really interesting to me, because they acknowledge that there is some inequity that exists in the way some of the community centers or parks are operating, or lack of park space in some of our communities.",148,,
815,0.97,6709.469,6722.949,I will say that one of the things that I hear pretty consistently from folks in the South and is that the way the reservation system works in our community centers is really problematic.,148,,
816,0.97,6722.949,6741.734,"Either because it's the same organizations that get access to classroom space or community classroom space, so new groups don't have the opportunity to come in and use the space.",148,,
817,0.97,6741.734,6742.769,That's one thing I hear.,148,,
818,0.97,6742.769,6769.896,"And then another thing I hear is about the athletic fields in particular, that I've heard this in Rainier Beach and Georgetown, that because the fields get reserved by high schools or by adult athletic leagues, that the kids who actually live in some of these neighborhoods don't get to play on those fields.",148,,
819,0.97,6769.896,6778.338,"So I wonder, I don't know if we can solve that problem right now, but I just want to share with you, and it sounds like, looks like by the shaking heads, that this is not new to you.",148,,
820,0.97,6778.338,6789.983,I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about what seems like an inequity for some folks who are trying to access fields and for any number of reasons aren't able to get to our park system.,148,,
821,0.97,6789.983,6791.551,So Maybe I'll jump in here.,149,,
822,0.97,6791.551,6802.662,Thank you for the Councilmember Morales.,149,,
823,0.97,6802.662,6805.732,"This problem, I want to acknowledge it is a real problem, particularly on athletic fields.",149,,
824,0.97,6805.732,6818.378,"We have a finite number of usable fields and we have way more demand for the use of those fields, and we have field availability when in fact we were having a discussion this morning about this same problem.",149,,
825,0.97,6818.378,6830.623,"It is a historical practice for park and recreation organizations across the country to use historic use for leagues, teams, et cetera.",149,,
826,0.97,6830.623,6832.759,This is something we need to continue to work on.,149,,
827,0.97,6832.759,6846.84,"We are going to stand up, kind of a community action committee to take a look at this issue and to see if there is some innovation that can be brought to the solution here.",149,,
828,0.97,6846.84,6849.842,We have much more flexibility in our interior spaces.,149,,
829,0.97,6849.842,6869.963,"We have 27 community centers across the city, and sometimes a person may not get the exact location or the exact space they want to use, but invariably, some space is always available in our indoor spaces.",149,,
830,0.97,6869.963,6872.632,So we really do try to work with people to balance that need.,149,,
831,0.97,6872.632,6876.236,Thank you.,150,,
832,0.97,6876.236,6880.44,"Thank you for flagging that, Councilmember Morales.",151,,
833,0.97,6880.44,6892.452,I had similar feedback from community members in district 7. so something to certainly continue to look into and appreciate the answers.,151,,
834,0.97,6892.452,6893.086,Councilmember Herbold?,151,,
835,0.97,6893.086,6923.716,"Thank you so much, just want to talk a little bit about a potential effort from parks that I became aware of because one of my constituents in Southpark had reached out to me earlier this year about the Mara farm park project and wishing that it had included a playground for the so many small children in the neighborhood, highest per capita youth population in the city.",152,,
836,0.97,6923.716,6926.753,And they don't have a whole lot of access to green space.,152,,
837,0.97,6926.753,6945.738,"This constituent noted that we understand that there is an approach for communities to raise their own funds for a project like this, and that parks does work with communities who want to raise their own funds.",152,,
838,0.97,6945.738,6952.378,"But of course, not every community can do that.",152,,
839,0.97,6952.378,6998.858,"And when we had this back and forth, including parks, I learned that you are actually encouraging more affluent Communitis who go the private fundraising route to consider voluntarily raising twice the amount they need in order to fund a similar project in a neighborhood without that ability, and that this is a new approach that you're testing out, and I just want to say here and now that it's something I'd learn more about, whether you are considering some sort of an equity fund that communities can access with these kinds of projects.",152,,
840,0.97,6998.858,7000.793,"Yes, so thank you for calling that out.",153,,
841,0.97,7000.793,7004.63,"This is a perfect time to be raising that issue, as we are Prioritizing park district spending.",153,,
842,0.97,7004.63,7012.238,"In the first cycle of the park district we had a major challenge Fund, and communities had to generate a match for up to $1.8 million.",153,,
843,0.97,7012.238,7017.844,Not every community had the capacity to do that.,153,,
844,0.97,7017.844,7029.989,A lot of projects didn't happen . and what we are looking there now is a grant cycle that won't require a match.,153,,
845,0.97,7029.989,7042.034,"Just because we realize not all neighborhoods have the same capacity, the same ability to fund raise, and a match--rather, a match isn't the answer, depending on which neighborhood you go to.",153,,
846,0.97,7042.034,7072.799,"We are continuing to work with community groups that have the financial affluence he to raise money, to sort of advocate for a shared approach where if they have the ability to fund raise, we try to pair them with a community that has some Aspirational desires for some improvements, and it's been working out moderately well to some locations.",153,,
847,0.97,7072.799,7087.18,"You pair the affluent communities project with the less affluent communities project and the fundraising effort goes out for both together, simultaneously?",154,,
848,0.97,7087.18,7087.98,Am I hearing that correctly?,154,,
849,0.97,7087.98,7093.419,It sounds like a really neat model.,154,,
850,0.97,7093.419,7105.698,"The way it works, and it works better on the advisory Council side, where we have community centers and we have advisory councils that want to do some improvement at a community center, because they are all under the Ark umbrella.",155,,
851,0.97,7105.698,7108.1,So we can facilitate those kinds of partnerships much easier.,155,,
852,0.97,7108.1,7117.91,Sometimes they are outdoor projects that we've been very successful piloting some of those approaches.,155,,
853,0.97,7117.91,7128.154,Thank you.,156,,
854,0.97,7128.354,7130.189,"Councilmember Morales, is that a new hand raise?",157,,
855,0.97,7130.189,7130.857,It is.,158,,
856,0.97,7130.857,7131.491,Okay.,159,,
857,0.97,7131.491,7131.924,Thank you.,160,,
858,0.97,7131.924,7134.727,I do have one other question that Councilmember Herbold reminded me.,160,,
859,0.97,7134.727,7158.584,"So I know that we've had--I've had a constituent who has contacted my office, contacted the Department about fencing, playground space for very young kids, creating sort of a toddler space, and I think she submitted a petition, and there's been a little bit of back and forth.",160,,
860,0.97,7158.584,7181.674,"My understanding is that there is a frustration that for parents of small kids, especially if there's more than one, there isn't a place where parents feel safe be in able to manage their kids without them being at risk of running off, so I'm wondering about how we might provide opportunity for that.",160,,
861,0.97,7181.674,7194.353,"I don't know if it's a funding issue, but it seems to me that if we can create a shy dog Park, we can create some protected space for parents with very small kids.",160,,
862,0.97,7194.353,7201.661,"So can you just talk a little bit about either what the decision-making processes for that, or how we might change the way we do something like that?",160,,
863,0.97,7201.661,7203.829,You bet.,161,,
864,0.97,7203.829,7210.536,"So generally, public parks and recreation isn't about fencing.",161,,
865,0.97,7210.536,7224.283,"We don't like to fence stuff off, but that is not to say that there aren't legitimate recreational activities that require a fence boundary.",161,,
866,0.97,7224.283,7227.553,We've taken a programmatic approach to fenced play areas.,161,,
867,0.97,7227.553,7247.073,"We recognize that there are play areas for smaller kids that require fencing, and either because of proximity to the street edge or proximity to kind of open space areas where kids can run out of a play area.",161,,
868,0.97,7247.073,7271.397,"So we do have those strategically positioned across the city, and I think in that case we responded back and pointed out two or three fenced play areas within I think a mile or two, but we would be happy to go back and take another look and reassess that, to reassess that fencing request.",161,,
869,0.97,7271.397,7277.87,Thank you.,162,,
870,0.97,7277.87,7285.711,Are there any other questions from colleagues?,163,,
871,0.97,7285.711,7286.212,Councilmember Mosqueda?,163,,
872,0.97,7286.212,7288.047,Thanks so much for the presentation.,164,,
873,0.97,7288.047,7305.398,"I'm intrigued by how the Department and the Rsji team uses, I think you called it a heat map to make determinations on where the biggest priorities are.",164,,
874,0.97,7305.398,7317.743,Can you tell me a little bit more about that and whether that's a tool that is available to other Rsji teams for looking at Prioritizing where policy changes are needed?,164,,
875,0.97,7317.743,7319.679,Have taken all of the questions so far.,165,,
876,0.97,7319.679,7322.048,Does any team member have a desire to Chime in here?,165,,
877,0.97,7322.048,7322.515,"B, maybe?",165,,
878,0.97,7322.515,7325.318,"Yeah, I was going to call on Tricia to Chime in, too.",166,,
879,0.97,7325.318,7326.919,Everything she does in parks and environment.,166,,
880,0.97,7326.919,7341.767,"So with that, of course it identifies the areas of the city with the highest disadvantage, highest need, and the lowest disadvantage.",166,,
881,0.97,7341.767,7351.911,So how are parks and environment crews and how our facility crews are using that is to Prioritize where services are offered.,166,,
882,0.97,7351.911,7366.826,"So with our facility screws, when work is offered on facilities maintenance and based on the area of the city that the work is needed in, as well as with parks and environment.",166,,
883,0.97,7366.826,7370.329,"So with our grounds crew, our programming and planning for litter pickup, grounds maintenance work.",166,,
884,0.97,7370.329,7376.802,They have an actual tool now to actually make real-time decisions based on information provided from this App.,166,,
885,0.97,7376.802,7386.445,And there are different data sets.,166,,
886,0.97,7386.445,7388.414,It's built off the race and social equity index.,166,,
887,0.97,7388.414,7411.137,"That's the foundation of A. but ten there are other data SETS which I'm not a technical expert as far as what data SETS are a part of it, but there are additional data SETS that can be clicked on and click off, to be able to help with Decision- making, and it starts with making sure it's equity centered, and ethics considerations are part of decision-making and Prioritization of work.",166,,
888,0.97,7411.137,7437.43,"The map includes data SETS like free and reduced lunch, school scholarship program eligibility, and some of the standard geographically centered measurements help drive that heat map.",167,,
889,0.97,7440.099,7459.151,"And if I could add--this is Belinda from the change team, just there's a layer of literal heat maps of where over consecutive days of heat there were members, S DOT, Sbu, they actually went around and measured all the temperatures.",168,,
890,0.97,7459.151,7465.691,Those areas won't surprise you that they sync up with historically Redlined areas.,168,,
891,0.97,7465.691,7467.76,"So that information is used as well, for decision-making.",168,,
892,0.97,7467.76,7490.85,"And can I add that along with the heat, it Associates with the number of trees in the area and the shading that contributes to the heat, and it also Aligns with disadvantage areas, when you look at an area that is overly hot and the temperatures coincide with that.",169,,
893,0.97,7490.85,7492.818,"It's all connected, isn't it?",170,,
894,0.97,7492.818,7497.156,It's all connected.,170,,
