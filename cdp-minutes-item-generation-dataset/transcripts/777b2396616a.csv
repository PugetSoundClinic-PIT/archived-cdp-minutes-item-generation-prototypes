36,0.97,142.909,150.884,But I think we can get through that in the allotted 20 minutes as opposed to extending it at the top.,19,,

64,0.97,322.989,334.2,"Police accountability is not justice or reform or refunding, accountability can be a part of those efforts but it is its own necessary goal, Foundational to any other changes.",21,,
65,0.97,334.2,338.404,Until the 1980s there was too little accountability for drunk driving.,21,,
66,0.97,338.404,342.842,What changed was holding people accountable.,21,,
67,0.97,342.842,352.752,"Setting up systems guarantees Fundabilities for society values and a pros Thaes can then help shape those values, changing policies next to patients.",21,,
68,0.97,352.752,358.091,"The same holds per women's rights, sexual assault, workers Mistreatment and more.",21,,
69,0.97,358.091,369.702,It is by making society aware of the Unjustices and indicating society's condemnation.,21,,
70,0.97,369.702,379.579,"Last November, other cities voted through the election process.",21,,
71,0.97,379.579,388.354,80% of the population in Oregon will have full civil control of the police setting complaints and imposing discipline directly.,21,,
72,0.97,388.354,396.863,A year after George Floyd's murder the Council has done nothing to face the accountability in Seattle.,21,,
73,0.97,396.863,406.506,"Public safety committee with Herbold, Gonzalez, and Sawant have been worse.",21,,
74,0.97,406.506,411.811,Maintaining the fiction that Seattle has police accountability.,21,,

80,0.97,428.127,428.928,My name is Thomas.,23,,
81,0.97,428.928,436.235,I would like to speak about how we should not allow our police to be trained by people who violate human rights.,23,,
82,0.97,436.235,441.541,"The police have been founded, from the beginning, on violating human rights.",23,,
83,0.97,441.541,445.244,They were slave patrol and to this day they still are.,23,,
84,0.97,445.244,457.423,Our 13th amendment allows slavery for prisoners and they have created with the help of the court system the world's largest prisoner population.,23,,
85,0.97,457.423,461.861,"That, to me, says it is clear that our police know how to violate human rights.",23,,
86,0.97,461.861,466.666,They do not need anymore training from anyone on how to do it.,23,,
87,0.97,466.666,474.006,And anymore training they receive from people who violate human rights are only going to help them violate more human rights.,23,,
88,0.97,474.006,475.741,That is what we do not need.,23,,
89,0.97,475.741,484.283,I don't think we should allow our police Department to be trained from anyone that violates human right rights and that includes Israel.,23,,
90,0.97,484.283,489.922,We need to stand in solidarity with anyone who is having their human rights violated.,23,,
91,0.97,489.922,494.927,We can do that by standing against anyone who violates our rights in every way we can.,23,,
92,0.97,494.927,505.638,"And since we have a large issue, with recent violence--[broken Audio]",23,,
93,0.97,505.938,518.317,Thank you for calling in Thomas.,24,,
94,0.97,518.317,533.533,You broke up on us a little bit there towards the end but we got the gist of what you were calling on.,24,,

98,0.97,554.053,575.975,"Especially in the contest of police brutality, ordinary people need to make sure the police have not been trained to make them a part of not being safe.",26,,
99,0.97,576.275,580.947,Even after the cease-fire is a violation of community safety and needs to stop.,26,,
100,0.97,580.947,593.092,This is true given that there have been pictures of officers having the knee on the neck Chock hold that murdered George Floyd.,26,,
101,0.97,593.092,594.193,We need to end this.,26,,
102,0.97,594.193,601.667,"In light of the recent heat wave and the Covid-19 crisis, public safety is more than just that.",26,,
103,0.97,601.667,621.687,"Investing in affordable housing and because of this, strongly in favor of initiatives by Sawant's office to use land from a Baptist church that the city forced the black church and community to sell 50 years ago to build affordable housing units for 87 households and to invest in renovations to the Garfield community center and high school.",26,,
104,0.97,621.687,630.396,It should be funded by the money diverted through the Amazon pack and expand big business taxes to further invest in social housing.,26,,
105,0.97,630.696,636.969,Thank you for calling in today.,27,,

113,0.97,657.39,669.602,I am calling because Seattle police should be banned from training or having any exchange with the military or the police of any nation that violates the Geneva conventions.,31,,
114,0.97,669.602,674.273,These are standards that most countries agreed to internationally for the last 70 years.,31,,
115,0.97,674.273,683.449,"There is no reason the police here in the Seattle police Department should have any business bringing back, you know, tactics of war, occupation to our streets.",31,,
116,0.97,683.449,686.886,"Last summer we saw 19,000 complaints.",31,,
117,0.97,686.886,702.902,Abuse of force against the Seattle police Department for attacking black lives matter protesters and the same Department admitted in the last eight years they sent top officers including the former police chief to train with the Israeli police and military forces.,31,,
118,0.97,702.902,709.742,The same forces that are carrying out a brutal occupation against Palestinian people.,31,,
119,0.97,709.742,718.017,Condemned worldwide by unions and faith and community groups for their brutal military assault on Gaza earlier this year.,31,,
120,0.97,718.017,726.892,The city Council has an obligation to support the legislation that Sawant's office will bring forward.,31,,
121,0.97,726.892,732.832,And bringing it forward in solidarity with the labor to end the deadly exchange.,31,,

127,0.97,757.623,767.032,Last year the black lives matter movement put a spotlight on the roll that police play in society and all across the country.,33,,
128,0.97,767.032,774.44,The police in Democratic-Party cities use of rubber bullets and tear gas.,33,,
129,0.97,774.44,779.178,I remember it getting into people's apartments because there was just so much being fired.,33,,
130,0.97,779.178,787.486,I think it is Supe important especially here in a city with the largest known police officers attending the January 6th riot.,33,,
131,0.97,787.486,818.617,"It is super important that right we are not having our police officers, having the police officers in this city trained with Militaries and police departments that have violated the Geneva conventions and then ultimately we need a Democratic police oversight board to put real police accountability in our hands, thanks.",33,,
132,0.97,818.918,828.527,Thank you for calling in today.,34,,
133,0.97,828.527,834.867,Next up is guy.,34,,

136,0.97,872.871,878.143,This is about Dematerializing the police and bringing safety back to the community.,36,,
137,0.97,878.143,885.584,"Letting communities, especially black and Brown communities in our city take charge of what safety and community health looks like.",36,,

146,0.97,939.204,946.712,There has not been any accountability from the homeless service providers as far as where does the money go.,39,,

148,0.97,948.58,949.615,I appreciate the time.,39,,

160,0.97,995.661,999.131,I work in the district.,46,,
161,0.97,999.131,1021.92,"Our research has shown many Psychedelic drugs can be effective in the treatment of Ptsd, depression and addiction, as someone who suffers from Ptsd I find it frustrating that full range of treatment options are not available because the city want Tossup hold criminal drug wars.",46,,
162,0.97,1021.92,1030.829,"The city Council and the public safety Committee, chaired by Councilmember Herbold delayed it from moving forward for two weeks now.",46,,
163,0.97,1030.829,1044.009,"I urge Council to stop the delays and support it, it is supported by strong scientific research and end the deadly exchange and ban the police to train with Israel.",46,,
164,0.97,1044.009,1048.747,Spd admitted they sent top offices to train with Israeli police and military.,46,,
165,0.97,1048.747,1055.554,"It is extremely troubling, these are the same forces that are repressed with the Palestinian people.",46,,
166,0.97,1055.554,1065.064,We saw the impacts of this training when they used rubble bullets and tear gas to Brutalize black lives matter protesters.,46,,
167,0.97,1065.064,1077.209,"I urge the Council to support it and stop delaying Sawants legislation to criminalize Psychedelics, thank you.",46,,

172,0.97,1104.67,1115.714,"Many police forces of Democrat- controlled cities launched offenses against peaceful protesters, we need to hold the police accountable and we need an elected community oversight board with full powers over the police.",48,,
173,0.97,1115.714,1120.619,I don't think we need to legislate after the fact that the police is training.,48,,
174,0.97,1120.619,1123.055,I am glad this legislation is brought forward now.,48,,
175,0.97,1123.055,1126.058,There is no reason to delay on passing this legislation.,48,,
176,0.97,1126.058,1132.064,"It seems like a bear minimum, that the Seattle police are not be forced.",48,,

265,0.97,1747.378,1751.983,It is common sense to go the same way with useful substances.,67,,
