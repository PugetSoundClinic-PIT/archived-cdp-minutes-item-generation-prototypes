14,0.97,84.818,111.945,"As I mentioned this morning, I do have one amendment to the proposed agenda by adding resolution 31946 entitled a resolution related to the response to the Covid-19 public health emergency requesting governor Inslee create a Washington worker relief fund to provide economic assistance to Undocumented Washingtonians during the Covid-19 pandemic and by placing it under the adoption of other resolutions on the agenda.",3,,

20,0.97,157.257,157.524,None opposed.,5,,
21,0.97,157.524,158.892,Thank you so much.,6,,
22,0.97,158.892,164.197,The motion carries and the agenda is adopted as amended.,6,,
23,0.97,164.197,176.943,"Colleagues, at this time we'll move into public comment as we have been doing, we'll open this remote public comment period for items on the city council agenda, introduction and referral calendar, and the Council's 2020 work program.",6,,
24,0.97,176.943,186.719,"Before we begin, I want to start by reminding colleagues and the viewing public that this is still a pilot and we're continually testing this process and working to improve it.",6,,
25,0.97,186.719,195.094,I ask that everyone please be patient as we learn to operate this new system in real time and navigate through its inevitable growing pains.,6,,
26,0.97,195.094,214.28,"While it remains our strong intent to have public comment regularly included on meeting Agendas, the city council does reserve the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point if we deem the system is being abused or is no longer suitable for our meetings to be conducted efficiently and in a manner that enables us to conduct our necessary business.",6,,
27,0.97,214.28,219.252,I will as usual moderate the public comment period in the following way.,6,,
28,0.97,219.252,244.744,"Our public comment period for this meeting is ordinarily 20 minutes and each Speaker is generally given two minutes, however, today we have a rather robust signup of public Commenters, and in order to advance the interest of hearing from as many people as possible, we do have about 68 Preregistered individuals.",6,,
29,0.97,244.744,252.785,Not everybody is present but we do have a significant volume of folks who have Preregistered to give public comment.,6,,
30,0.97,252.785,262.929,So today we will allot one minute of public comment to everyone in order to maximize the opportunity to hear from as many folks as we can.,6,,
31,0.97,262.929,280.747,"We do have one exception to that rule and that is for our non-English proficient speakers who have Preregistered, for those individuals, I think we have three of those Nonenglish proficient speakers.",6,,
32,0.97,280.747,306.305,"They'll have a translation available to them and so in order to accommodate both the public comment and the translation services, we're going to allow a total of four minutes for those non-English proficient speakers to make sure we're maximizing language access to our public comment period here.",6,,
33,0.97,306.305,323.523,So I appreciate the indulgence on that particular issue to make sure that we remain accessible to non-English speakers who wish to provide the city council with public testimony on matters of importance to our agenda.,6,,
34,0.97,323.523,340.373,"So with that being said, we're going to go ahead and--just a moment, colleagues.",6,,
35,0.97,340.373,340.707,My apologies.,6,,
36,0.97,340.707,348.214,I'll call on each Speaker by name and the order in which they registered on the Council's Website.,6,,
37,0.97,348.214,359.325,"If you've not registered to speak but would like to, you can sign up by going to Seattle.Gov/Council.",6,,
38,0.97,359.325,363.796,The public comment link is also listed on today's agenda.,6,,
39,0.97,363.796,374.707,"Once I call speakers' name, staff will Unmute the microphone and an automatic prompt of you've been Unmuted is the Speaker's Cue, it is your turn to speak.",6,,
40,0.97,374.707,378.911,Please state your name and the item you're addressing.,6,,
41,0.97,378.911,383.182,The introduction referral calendar or the Council's 2020 work program.,6,,
42,0.97,383.182,389.222,Speakers will hear a Chime when 10 seconds are left of the allotted time.,6,,
43,0.97,389.222,393.359,"Once the Speaker hears the Chime, we ask you begin to wrap up your public comments.",6,,
44,0.97,393.359,404.437,"If speakers do not end comments at the allotted time provided, the Speaker's microphone will be muted to allow us to call on the next Speaker.",6,,
45,0.97,404.437,414.247,"If you plan to continue following this meeting, we ask that you do so by watching on Seattle channel or any one of the listening options on the agenda.",6,,
46,0.97,414.247,421.754,The public comment will now be opened and I'll proceed to calling the first person on the list.,6,,
47,0.97,421.754,422.388,It's 12:26.% I apologize.,6,,
48,0.97,422.388,423.156,It's 2:10 P.M.,6,,
49,0.97,423.156,426.759,We'll hear public comment until 2:30 P.M.,6,,
50,0.97,426.759,431.33,At which time we'll likely extend.,6,,
51,0.97,431.33,438.471,The first Speaker is Ecram Abdi.,6,,
52,0.97,438.471,440.139,Hello.,7,,
53,0.97,440.139,442.275,I am a Lyft driver.,7,,
54,0.97,442.275,446.245,I've been driving for Lyft for almost two years now.,7,,
55,0.97,446.245,461.494,"What I want to say is since this pandemic started, it's been very difficult to earn a living driving for Lyft or any other Rideshare.",7,,
56,0.97,461.494,485.685,"And a lot of times when I'm doing this, when I'm driving, I'm picking up people from the hospital and dropping off people to the hospital and when I'm doing those kinds of rides, I have to be extra cautious and I have to be very careful because I have a family that I go home to that are very high risk to this virus.",7,,
57,0.97,485.685,501.133,I live with my Grandma and it is hard for me to drive when dropping off people.,7,,
58,0.97,501.133,509.075,I have to clean my car every time I give those rides because I want to protect my customers and my next ride.,7,,
59,0.97,509.075,517.483,"So a lot of times I have to cancel my ride, my next ride to clean my car.",7,,
60,0.97,517.483,519.685,It's coming out of my expenses.,7,,
61,0.97,519.685,533.032,"But mostly I'm worried a lot of times for my family that I go home to and my health because if I don't drive, if I don't go out there and make money, there's no way I'll be able to pay my bills.",7,,
62,0.97,533.032,539.839,Nobody else is going to be able to pay my bills because I'm the only one that takes care of my family.,7,,
63,0.97,539.839,550.549,And it's very risky for me to put my life at this time and drive like this.,7,,
64,0.97,550.549,553.653,Thank you for that.,8,,
65,0.97,553.653,558.624,"My apologies, colleagues, and to those on the line, for those of you who were keeping track of time.",8,,
66,0.97,558.624,562.795,That was definitely longer than a minute.,8,,
67,0.97,562.795,569.068,It took me a minute to realize that the Timer had not been started.,8,,
68,0.97,569.068,569.802,So I've Messaged the I.T.,8,,
69,0.97,569.802,579.345,Department and they are now on it and they're going to remember to hit the button to start the time before the next Speaker speaks.,8,,
70,0.97,579.345,586.218,So the next Speaker is Tiffany McCoy.,8,,
71,0.97,586.218,587.386,"Good afternoon, council.",9,,
72,0.97,587.386,589.455,My name is Tiffany McCoy.,9,,
73,0.97,589.455,597.33,I'm the lead Organizer at real change calling in favor of Morales' ordinance on the sweep.,9,,
74,0.97,597.33,602.635,Last week we held a protest against the sweep that took place at the Ballard Commons.,9,,
75,0.97,602.635,613.112,"We were really concerned about how it didn't fall under CDC guidelines to not sweep Encampments unless individual housing units are available, and from what I understand, that was not met.",9,,
76,0.97,613.112,615.348,So why are we moving folks around the city?,9,,
77,0.97,615.348,618.851,There were concerns about hepatitis A.,9,,
78,0.97,618.851,624.423,"That's the same issue with Covid, potentially being moved by folks.",9,,
79,0.97,624.423,629.962,So we're potentially moving Hep-A around the city as well.,9,,
80,0.97,629.962,644.944,"It's time also to re-evaluate the police presence on the navigation team, pictures of fully armed police circled around vulnerable populations is disturbing and I want to know what triggers the amount of police on a navigation team?",9,,
81,0.97,644.944,650.049,We need to stop this subjective nature of Sweeps overall so please support this ordinance.,9,,
82,0.97,650.049,652.018,"Thank you, Tiffany.",10,,
83,0.97,652.018,658.491,Our next Speaker is William DOE.,10,,
84,0.97,658.491,659.091,Hi.,11,,
85,0.97,659.091,662.495,My name is William and I appreciate this opportunity.,11,,
86,0.97,662.495,663.629,I'll keep it brief.,11,,
87,0.97,663.629,664.997,I'm a Lyft driver.,11,,
88,0.97,664.997,665.498,I do this full-time.,11,,
89,0.97,665.498,670.136,I don't have health insurance.,11,,
90,0.97,670.136,680.579,"I have a 78-Year-Old father who just beat lung cancer and pneumonia and I have a wife at home who has Epilepsy and hypertension, both high risk.",11,,
91,0.97,680.579,690.856,I'm spending about $100 a week right now on Disinfectant and protective equipment.,11,,
92,0.97,690.856,692.958,Unemployment will run out.,11,,
93,0.97,692.958,694.427,Their little programs will run out.,11,,
94,0.97,694.427,701.0,"If I get sick, we'll be in trouble.",11,,
95,0.97,701.0,701.367,Please help us.,11,,
96,0.97,701.367,703.202,Just looking forward to some changes.,11,,
97,0.97,703.202,703.736,Thank you.,11,,
98,0.97,703.736,707.339,"Thank you, William, for calling in today.",12,,
99,0.97,707.339,712.411,Our next Speaker is sue Hodus.,12,,
100,0.97,712.411,712.812,Hi.,13,,
101,0.97,712.812,713.879,My name is sue.,13,,
102,0.97,713.879,717.016,I'm part of the housing for all coalition.,13,,
103,0.97,717.016,729.295,I'm also part of the Ferdinand block 3900 that supplies some food to a couple shelters and I'm also part of the Intergenerational Lesbian activist group.,13,,
104,0.97,729.295,730.863,I don't have much to say.,13,,
105,0.97,730.863,737.403,It seems so obvious about this legislation needing to be passed.,13,,
106,0.97,737.403,747.68,It's just human to not displace people when this recommendation is that no Sweeps until people have a place to go.,13,,
107,0.97,747.68,754.52,It's already disrupting fragile people's lives who are in fragile communities to nothingness.,13,,
108,0.97,754.52,756.122,"So really, it's the right thing to do.",13,,
109,0.97,756.122,762.495,I can't believe anybody would object to this including the Mayor.,13,,
110,0.97,762.495,767.233,And please support Tammy Morales' legislation.,13,,
111,0.97,767.233,767.5,Thank you.,13,,
112,0.97,767.5,771.203,Thank you for calling in today.,14,,
113,0.97,771.203,775.407,Next Speaker is Jake Lindsey.,14,,
114,0.97,775.407,775.641,Hi.,15,,
115,0.97,775.641,778.844,My name is Jake Lindsey.,15,,
116,0.97,778.844,780.98,I'm an Uber and Lyft driver for five years.,15,,
117,0.97,780.98,786.752,I wanted to share my experience trying to qualify for Uber and Lyft sick pay.,15,,
118,0.97,786.752,793.492,I have a suppressed immune system and a history of respiratory illness.,15,,
119,0.97,793.492,799.532,And Uber's first sick pay didn't cover people with Pre-Existing conditions.,15,,
120,0.97,799.532,818.217,"So I wasn't qualified but then when they changed it on April 10th, they would cover the Pre-Existing conditions, they said that you have to have driven in the last 30 days which is March 10th, people already dying from this disease.",15,,
121,0.97,818.217,828.36,"So because I was spending those 30 days in Self-Isolation, a doctor's note with Self-Isolation, I was deemed ineligible as thousands of other drivers were.",15,,
122,0.97,828.36,841.874,"So I think the lawmakers need to step in here because let's not forget how many billions Uber can afford to pay their executives, when their workers who are the backbone of the industry are asked to sacrifice themselves for the pandemic.",15,,
123,0.97,841.874,844.743,Thank you for calling in.,16,,
124,0.97,844.743,851.584,Next up is Kameela Walter.,16,,
125,0.97,851.584,851.984,Hi.,17,,
126,0.97,851.984,852.952,I'm a Ballard resident.,17,,
127,0.97,852.952,861.694,I have spent a lot of time at meals programs and at the camps in Ballard and I urge you to support Morales' ordinances to stop sweeping people.,17,,
128,0.97,861.694,865.998,Be a part of a better solution that takes into account the experiences of all of us.,17,,
129,0.97,865.998,873.405,"As a resident who lives just blocks from the park that was swept earlier this month, I can tell you this encampment posed no threat at all to my safety.",17,,
130,0.97,873.405,882.181,All it did was put my neighbors at risk of losing everything and falsely showed them that Ballard is an unwelcome and inhospitable neighborhood.,17,,
131,0.97,882.181,891.09,"If we truly want better living conditions for all Seattleites, the answer is more housing, services, and care, and not armed officers moving people away from their communities.",17,,
132,0.97,891.09,897.93,"The original intent of these Sweeps were to get people out of dangerous living conditions and into shelters or housing, but that is not what's happening.",17,,
133,0.97,897.93,909.074,"Instead, people who are living safely in tents, keeping social distance during a global pandemic, finding support from their neighborhood communities are approached by armed police officers in full uniform with guns.",17,,
134,0.97,909.074,917.75,"When you've experienced a significant trauma like losing housing, being approached by an armed uniform officer is not helpful.",17,,
135,0.97,917.75,922.054,Thank you so much.,18,,
136,0.97,922.054,950.649,"Colleagues, this is a little unorthodox, but I have some folks who have called in related to the Council bill who expressed they have limited phone--wanting to speak sooner.",18,,
137,0.97,950.649,958.29,They're currently showing--I'm unable to confirm that they're actually on the line.,18,,
138,0.97,958.29,984.216,"We're going to work on that, but if we can confirm that they're Online, I'd be happy to make a special accommodation for a group of speakers who are unsheltered or sheltered at tiny villages who are having some technology limitations and I certainly don't want to exclude them based on that.",18,,
139,0.97,984.216,991.757,"So if we get confirmation that they're on the line, I'd be happy to do that but currently they're showing as not present.",18,,
140,0.97,991.757,994.526,We'll go ahead and move through the list.,18,,
141,0.97,994.526,1004.37,"And Councilmember Sawant, if you can help me in figuring out if they're present or not or can be off line, I'd appreciate that.",18,,
142,0.97,1004.37,1006.538,Okay.,18,,
143,0.97,1006.538,1009.008,Thank you.,18,,
144,0.97,1009.008,1010.309,Next up is Peggy.,18,,
145,0.97,1010.309,1013.145,"Good afternoon, Councilmembers.",19,,
146,0.97,1013.145,1017.816,My name is Peggy Hotes and I'm a Nickelsville founder and volunteer.,19,,
147,0.97,1017.816,1024.523,I want to report most of the people living at Nickelsville tiny House village were tested for the Coronavirus last week and all were negative.,19,,
148,0.97,1024.523,1030.963,"Unfortunately, the city has yet to commit to allowing the village to stay in the same spot until the end of the state of emergency.",19,,
149,0.97,1030.963,1041.273,I'm in support of Councilmember Gonzalez ordinance that would create a moratorium on Sweeps during the state of emergency and really ought to continue all the way through forever.,19,,
150,0.97,1041.273,1056.088,Another item on your agenda is Hsd's budget increase that would fund Deintesifying existing shelters with expensive motel rooms and a small amount for the existing tiny House village operator monopoly that exists.,19,,
151,0.97,1056.088,1065.464,The sanctioned encampment ordinance that the council passed several months ago needs to be implemented and the 40 new tiny House villages opened.,19,,
152,0.97,1065.464,1070.302,"Most importantly, grassroots and Faith-Based organizations should have an opportunity to operate those tiny House villages.",19,,
153,0.97,1070.302,1077.876,"In fact, it's physically irresponsible to not explore how cost University other operators could be.",19,,
154,0.97,1077.876,1078.143,Thank you.,19,,
155,0.97,1078.143,1090.556,"Thank you so much for calling in and for sake of clarity, it's Councilmember Morales' legislation, not mine.",20,,
156,0.97,1090.556,1096.428,Just want to make sure credit is given where credit is due.,20,,
157,0.97,1096.428,1101.133,The next Speaker and Daniel.,20,,
158,0.97,1101.133,1101.5,"Hi, everyone.",21,,
159,0.97,1101.5,1104.77,My name is Daniel Mccraw.,21,,
160,0.97,1104.77,1106.638,I'm a participant as well.,21,,
161,0.97,1106.638,1115.514,"In addition to supporting this draft ordinance, I want to ask that the budget change the city council is doing today be amended and improved.",21,,
162,0.97,1115.514,1127.125,"Sheriff, for example, has offered up new efforts to improve homeless that aren't being done by the institutional mass shelter system.",21,,
163,0.97,1127.125,1137.069,Our testing has been done recently on all the tent cities and we came out with zero positives.,21,,
164,0.97,1137.069,1147.513,"Meanwhile, we're putting all this money into programs that just plain haven't worked and they're not going to work in the future and we really don't want to go back to that.",21,,
165,0.97,1147.513,1156.488,A shift in operations for us to 24/7 which we've done with the support of the host at our shelters has been pretty much all consuming.,21,,
166,0.97,1156.488,1159.992,It's pretty much a matter of survival.,21,,

180,0.97,1208.507,1210.542,They were appreciated by their employer.,23,,
181,0.97,1210.542,1222.554,"Now solely because they're Undocumented, and unlike myself who can apply for unemployment benefits, they're unable to do so.",23,,
182,0.97,1222.554,1222.921,This is unfair.,23,,

200,0.97,1418.984,1426.258,This has generated great emotional stress for all of us because we do not have any type of resources to alleviate our situation.,26,,
201,0.97,1426.258,1432.831,"We cannot even pay our most basic expenses such as rent, insurance, telephones, and Internet for my children to do their homework.",26,,
202,0.97,1432.831,1447.546,"It's very sad to tell my children that we have to ration our food portions and more so that the food is enough for the days and that my 12- and 13-Year-Old children ask their dad and myself if they can already start working to help with the expenses, if not being left homeless.",26,,
203,0.97,1447.546,1463.528,"It's a shame to see how the system in this country is broken, full of hopelessness and inequality that as low income families, we pay more taxes and they only see us as equal when it comes to paying and not receiving what is fair.",26,,
204,0.97,1463.528,1467.899,This country with hard work and paying our taxes.,26,,
205,0.97,1467.899,1473.471,I think we're not asking for anything we've not earned because these funds that are delivered to us leave us out.,26,,
206,0.97,1473.471,1481.947,That's why I asked for your support to deport the Washington worker relief fund for Undocumented people.,26,,

219,0.97,1602.0,1605.036,I was muted and didn't realize it.,29,,

233,0.97,1713.678,1719.417,My household is being impacted just like tons of immigrant families are being impacted due to Covid-19.,31,,
234,0.97,1719.417,1725.056,"That's the reason why I'm here, to talk to you about Washington worker relief fund for Undocumented immigrants.",31,,
235,0.97,1725.056,1728.226,"If it's okay, I'll approach you in Spanish because that's the community that I represent.",31,,
236,0.97,1728.226,1732.53,I'm going to start by sharing how difficult the situation has been for my family.,31,,
237,0.97,1732.53,1738.77,"For a family like mine, and why it's so important to have the economic relief program for Undocumented communities.",31,,
238,0.97,1738.77,1743.475,To have lost my job and not be able to apply or receive any kind of help has been devastating.,31,,
239,0.97,1743.475,1747.345,I came to this country 14 years ago and I've always worked hard and long hours.,31,,
240,0.97,1747.345,1753.118,I've never received any kind of help because it was important for me to set an example for my children.,31,,
241,0.97,1753.118,1761.059,I never saw the situation that we are experiencing today arrive where I could not work and stay home for the well-being of my children.,31,,
242,0.97,1761.059,1763.194,We have to decide between our health and our need.,31,,
243,0.97,1763.194,1768.399,This is why I ask you to support permanent emergency fund for the Undocumented community in Washington state.,31,,
244,0.97,1768.399,1786.184,"I'm just an example of how having and being included in a program can affect or benefit our family because like many immigrant families, we contribute to our communities and deserve the dignity and support that anyone else in this country has.",31,,

254,0.97,1833.531,1845.91,"And if I get sick or my children get sick, then I will need a family paid leave which I do not get as a gig worker who is an essential worker on the front lines.",33,,
255,0.97,1845.91,1861.159,"And because my unemployment has been tied up, I'm unable to provide for my family and I'm being forced to return to work and risk getting sick and getting my children sick.",33,,

297,0.97,2164.462,2170.101,In those two months the debts accumulated and Unfortunately we have to pay them because they're not going to forgive us.,40,,
298,0.97,2170.101,2181.712,"It gives me a lot of sadness and anger that due to the fact we're Undocumented immigrants, we do not have any benefits or financial assistance like any citizen.",40,,
299,0.97,2181.712,2183.08,All us Undocumented immigrants pay taxes.,40,,
300,0.97,2183.08,2191.222,One of the most unfair and sad things is our children who are U.S. citizens are harmed and Jeopardizeed by being children of Undocumented immigrants.,40,,

315,0.97,2274.505,2299.463,"So if there's no objection from my colleagues, I'd like to go ahead and have them go ahead and speak now out of order based on the fact that they, unlike those of us who have full access to Plug-Ins to Recharter our phones, I'd like to give them an opportunity to speak now.",41,,

336,0.97,2434.198,2435.766,So it's not really worth it.,44,,
337,0.97,2435.766,2443.207,That barely covers the expenses to even run the car.,44,,
338,0.97,2443.207,2446.043,"And so, I mean, I'm really struggling.",44,,
339,0.97,2446.043,2448.679,I've got $106 in my bank account.,44,,
340,0.97,2448.679,2451.115,And I blew out my knee about a week ago.,44,,
341,0.97,2451.115,2455.019,So it's been really hard to work.,44,,
342,0.97,2455.019,2464.795,So I just want to say that I feel like we should all be--gig workers should be cared about.,44,,
343,0.97,2464.795,2466.13,Thank you so much for your time.,44,,
344,0.97,2466.13,2469.667,Thank you so much for calling in today.,45,,

352,0.97,2501.999,2508.505,I'm asking the Council to support Cb11793 and I'm with working Washington.,46,,
353,0.97,2508.505,2509.006,They're helping us.,46,,
354,0.97,2509.006,2515.412,To help us because we deserve to get paid sick pay if we get sick and we deserve sick leave.,46,,
355,0.97,2515.412,2519.216,We are putting a lot on the line for a lot of people.,46,,
356,0.97,2519.216,2523.787,We're the backbone for people to stay home and I thank you and we're hurting.,46,,
357,0.97,2523.787,2525.356,We need your help.,46,,
358,0.97,2525.356,2530.261,And you as legislators can do that since the companies won't.,46,,

363,0.97,2551.548,2558.689,I've been a proud domestic worker since 2006.,48,,
364,0.97,2558.689,2581.011,"When this virus hit overnight, I don't have no clients and that made it difficult just to be living in this crisis and my husband is American citizen but because of my status, we're not allowed to receive the stimulus.",48,,
365,0.97,2581.011,2594.525,We've run into a lot of problems and I'm concerned about it.,48,,
366,0.97,2594.525,2600.764,Iask you [inaudible] we're being hurt a lot.,48,,
367,0.97,2600.764,2601.065,Thank you.,48,,

370,0.97,2612.81,2613.344,Hello.,50,,

372,0.97,2617.147,2620.884,And a few years back I met folks at tent city 3.,50,,
373,0.97,2620.884,2629.026,And at that time I became more committed to advocating for Self-Efficiency models addressing homelessness.,50,,
374,0.97,2629.026,2634.465,We need to find more of those.,50,,
375,0.97,2634.465,2650.547,What I really want to asked to is that--a group of housed homeowners who Selfishly use find it fix it to report Encampments and dehumanize people who are living outside.,50,,
376,0.97,2650.547,2654.451,If you could educate them about the CDC guidelines for Sweeps.,50,,
377,0.97,2654.451,2668.165,"If you could encourage them to not at this time focus on what they see out their window, address root causes and if they want to help people that are outside, not to use find it fix it App, an App for police.",50,,
378,0.97,2668.165,2671.168,Thank you for the time today.,50,,
379,0.97,2671.168,2672.67,Thank you for calling in.,51,,
380,0.97,2672.67,2680.811,Our next Speaker is Phoenix Decorvo.,51,,
381,0.97,2680.811,2681.512,Hi.,52,,
382,0.97,2681.512,2683.414,My name is Phoenix.,52,,
383,0.97,2683.414,2685.482,I'm active in working Washington's Payup campaign.,52,,
384,0.97,2685.482,2690.487,I'm addressing the importance of sick and hazard pay for gig workers.,52,,
385,0.97,2690.487,2694.391,I've done grocery delivery on Instacart.,52,,
386,0.97,2694.391,2698.028,I have a toddler and someone close to me with a heart condition.,52,,
387,0.97,2698.028,2706.37,"Since people started dying from Covid-19, I decided the less than $10 I was making was not a good Trade-Off for my or their lives.",52,,
388,0.97,2706.37,2709.64,Many Seattle residents rely on these services.,52,,
389,0.97,2709.64,2714.078,A majority of my customers are elderly or high risk.,52,,
390,0.97,2714.078,2720.384,"Without sick leave, gig workers are given this impossible choice between caring for their family or spreading the virus.",52,,
391,0.97,2720.384,2724.822,This is a public health issue as well as a worker's rights issue.,52,,
392,0.97,2724.822,2734.631,It's become too easy for these companies to make money while taking advantage of us.,52,,
393,0.97,2734.631,2739.47,Thank you so much.,53,,
394,0.97,2739.47,2746.143,Our next Speaker is Kimberley Wolf.,53,,
395,0.97,2746.143,2747.377,Kimberley Wolf.,54,,
396,0.97,2747.377,2751.248,Both Lyft and delivery gig work in Seattle and participant in the Payup campaign.,54,,
397,0.97,2751.248,2760.09,I'm here because I want Seattle to do the right thing and make sure gig workers get sick leave and hazard pay for the health of both the workers and our community.,54,,
398,0.97,2760.09,2764.094,"During this crisis, gig workers are taking on real risks for less pay.",54,,
399,0.97,2764.094,2768.599,Apps don't pay enough for us to afford even the basic protective equipment.,54,,
400,0.97,2768.599,2777.007,"We've been pinched into a tiny stressful space between decreasing income, rising expenses, and now increased physical hazard.",54,,
401,0.97,2777.007,2785.015,"We're extremely vulnerable in this space where any small thing that goes wrong, like getting sick, could cause catastrophe in our lives.",54,,
402,0.97,2785.015,2788.919,Something's got to give and I'm afraid it's going to be us.,54,,
403,0.97,2788.919,2789.453,It is simple.,54,,
404,0.97,2789.453,2790.087,We get sick.,54,,
405,0.97,2790.087,2791.555,"If we get sick, we don't work.",54,,
406,0.97,2791.555,2794.224,"If we don't work, we don't eat.",54,,
407,0.97,2794.224,2795.726,And no money for housing.,54,,
408,0.97,2795.726,2800.197,That means you may end up in a tent on the hill on the side of the highway like I did.,54,,
409,0.97,2800.197,2809.706,We gig workers don't get the same protections as every other worker in this state and it is time to bring this new sector of workers up to the same level of protection.,54,,
410,0.97,2809.706,2809.973,Thank you.,54,,
411,0.97,2809.973,2811.708,Thank you for calling in today.,55,,
412,0.97,2811.708,2817.514,Our next Speaker is James Thomas.,55,,
413,0.97,2817.514,2823.12,I started doing gig work in October 2016.,56,,
414,0.97,2823.12,2827.824,"I've been out there for about 15,000 trips, people and food.",56,,
415,0.97,2827.824,2834.264,"When I first started on Postmates, I was telling everybody about it because I was getting a $4.50 minimum.",56,,
416,0.97,2834.264,2837.868,Now it's down to no minimum.,56,,
417,0.97,2837.868,2840.404,They were paying 15 cents a minute.,56,,
418,0.97,2840.404,2843.907,Now they're paying 7 cents a minute.,56,,
419,0.97,2843.907,2849.58,"But the pay has gone down so much, you actually do a delivery for $2.",56,,
420,0.97,2849.58,2851.882,"What am I, an 8-year-old child?",56,,
421,0.97,2851.882,2864.494,People leave me very positive reviews but I rely on types and it's been well documented customers often tip based on gender and race.,56,,
422,0.97,2864.494,2867.664,I often get a smile and thank you instead of a tip for doing a great job.,56,,
423,0.97,2867.664,2874.504,I was still out there working during the pandemic until about a month ago but I have three daughters who told me to stay home.,56,,
424,0.97,2874.504,2879.543,One minute is not enough and thank you for your time.,56,,
425,0.97,2879.543,2880.01,Make something happen.,56,,
426,0.97,2880.01,2886.65,"Thank you so much for calling in, James, a know a minute goes by very quickly.",57,,
427,0.97,2886.65,2897.461,This legislation is just being introduced today but we'll have plenty of opportunity for public Commenters to call in in the future and speak some more as to this particular item.,57,,
428,0.97,2897.461,2902.099,Next up is Jason Reeves.,57,,
429,0.97,2902.099,2902.566,Hello.,58,,
430,0.97,2902.566,2904.134,I'm Jason Reeves.,58,,
431,0.97,2904.134,2907.938,I'm volunteering with working Washington's pay up campaign.,58,,
432,0.97,2907.938,2908.739,I'm a Dasher.,58,,
433,0.97,2908.739,2910.307,I have been for three years.,58,,
434,0.97,2910.307,2917.114,Right now there's a record amount of people signing up for Doordash and other gig companies.,58,,
435,0.97,2917.114,2919.549,And it's putting a strain on everybody.,58,,
436,0.97,2919.549,2922.886,"It means more competition, longer waits, more scams, and lower pay.",58,,
437,0.97,2922.886,2925.656,We're really at a race to the bottom.,58,,
438,0.97,2925.656,2929.626,The six feet are being broken everybody.,58,,
439,0.97,2929.626,2936.366,"Cinco de Mayo, I lost $15 in a half hour and was exposed to an entire restaurant denied orders because we're gig companies.",58,,
440,0.97,2936.366,2943.707,Gig companies need to be held Abilityable accountable and we need to leave.,58,,
441,0.97,2943.707,2954.618,I'd urge city Council to hold companies accountable for providing sick leave and other basic pay standards like the pay that accounts for our time and the risk we're taking.,58,,
442,0.97,2954.618,2959.856,Thank you for calling in.,59,,
443,0.97,2959.856,2965.996,Next up is Paul Vegers.,59,,
444,0.97,2965.996,2979.643,"I've been a courier with Uber eats for about a year and a half and since the pandemic has started, I've definitely found myself in a lot of situations that feel very high risk.",60,,
445,0.97,2979.643,2994.491,I delivered on University way in the U district on a regular basis and I find myself on a regular basis being in spaces where only two or three feet of distance between me and other people.,60,,
446,0.97,2994.491,3010.674,"And since the pandemic started, I've noticed there's been extremely inconsistent pay where one week we'll be having large bonuses and then the next week it will drop down to half that pay and I'll only be pulling in $5 or $10 an hour in terms of base pay.",60,,
447,0.97,3010.674,3030.093,"I'm very, very fortunate in that I have enough in savings that if I end up having to take several weeks off, I can afford to but I worry a lot about other people that cannot and because of that, I think it's very important to have sick leave insured for everybody.",60,,
448,0.97,3030.093,3031.795,Thank you so much for calling in.,61,,
449,0.97,3031.795,3036.733,Our next Speaker is Aiden Nardon.,61,,
450,0.97,3036.733,3037.167,Good afternoon.,62,,
451,0.97,3037.167,3040.804,I want to talk about some housing options.,62,,
452,0.97,3040.804,3048.211,About five years ago we started with the 90-day temporary stay in a tent in a sanctioned encampment.,62,,
453,0.97,3048.211,3052.149,We then stepped up to tiny home villages.,62,,
454,0.97,3052.149,3061.725,"Now I hear opposition to this arrangement because even though the clients have private sleeping quarters, they are still sharing bathrooms, showers, and kitchens.",62,,
455,0.97,3061.725,3069.032,"We are Reconfiguring some of our existing shelters, facilities, and providing modular units.",62,,
456,0.97,3069.032,3073.77,"These models offer a safe, more distant sleeping arrangement.",62,,
457,0.97,3073.77,3080.61,"But they still require sharing bathrooms, showers, and utilizing food areas.",62,,
458,0.97,3080.61,3087.517,Now the next plan is to move on to private rooms with private baths and a meal delivery program.,62,,
459,0.97,3087.517,3093.323,"Tell me, what do you propose we do next if this plan doesn't work?",62,,
460,0.97,3093.323,3101.598,Will we still have thousands of people still living in tents on our sidewalks and green belts and parks?,62,,
461,0.97,3101.598,3103.467,Thank you for calling in.,63,,
462,0.97,3103.467,3109.973,Our next Speaker is Maria a.,63,,

466,0.97,3116.046,3116.947,Okay.,66,,

470,0.97,3124.588,3136.233,I've been homeless for a long time and I was given the opportunity to go there and it has been a value for me.,66,,
471,0.97,3136.233,3136.633,I also work.,66,,
472,0.97,3136.633,3148.879,"So I'm calling in to say since everything else is closed down, it's very hard for us to find another place right now.",66,,
473,0.97,3148.879,3166.696,I'm sitting in to have us stay there at least end of the year or longer just to keep everyone safe instead of us moving and trying to find a place during everything being shut down.,66,,
474,0.97,3166.696,3171.768,Keeping our hygiene and everything else intact.,66,,
475,0.97,3171.768,3172.068,Thank you.,66,,

481,0.97,3189.686,3192.022,I'm a gig worker in Seattle.,68,,
482,0.97,3192.022,3194.524,I'm here with the working Washington.,68,,
483,0.97,3194.524,3197.961,I've been working over three years with Lyft full-time.,68,,
484,0.97,3197.961,3211.875,"We're asking the city Council to make sure the workers get sick leave because we need to have some hope that if we get sick, we can pay our bills, feed our families without getting into debt like I'm now in debt.",68,,
485,0.97,3211.875,3217.38,I have to keep working during this crisis because my family depends fully on me.,68,,
486,0.97,3217.38,3219.683,My wife stays at home with the kids.,68,,
487,0.97,3219.683,3227.357,"I'm working even more hours, getting less than $500 a week.",68,,
488,0.97,3227.357,3229.059,Every day I worry.,68,,
489,0.97,3229.059,3238.034,"I take passengers to hospitals who are even coughing, sneezing.",68,,
490,0.97,3238.034,3247.077,"If we get sick, it could be tough for me.",68,,

496,0.97,3264.427,3267.397,I started doing gig work in 2018.,70,,
497,0.97,3267.397,3275.005,It was my primary source of income until I got my current job as a teaching assistant for adults with special needs in Seattle.,70,,
498,0.97,3275.005,3282.812,"Since the crisis hit, my employer obtained a Ppp loan.",70,,
499,0.97,3282.812,3291.087,I'm very thankful this is the case because I cannot imagine what I would have done if I would have gotten sick while gig work was my only source of income.,70,,
500,0.97,3291.087,3295.825,"Since we gig workers are independent contractors, we don't get sick leave.",70,,
501,0.97,3295.825,3302.465,This puts gig workers in a tight spot where they may be forced to work while paying basic living expenses.,70,,
502,0.97,3302.465,3307.103,"I hope by passing this bill, we gig workers will no longer have to be put in this situation.",70,,
503,0.97,3307.103,3316.379,Thank you for allowing me to speak on this issue that's of so much importance to so many vulnerable workers in the city at this time.,70,,
504,0.97,3316.379,3322.385,Thank you for calling in today.,71,,

511,0.97,3342.539,3345.241,One that is unsupported by the city.,72,,
512,0.97,3345.241,3353.75,At present you have an amendment on the books that would ask for extended funding for a tiny House village.,72,,
513,0.97,3353.75,3358.288,We urge you to include Nickelsville in that budget.,72,,
514,0.97,3358.288,3364.16,We also urge you to stop the sweep at present.,72,,
515,0.97,3364.16,3368.198,Our Unhoused neighbors aren't as lucky as we are here.,72,,
516,0.97,3368.198,3376.473,It is unprecedented during this time of health crisis to be moving people around the city and endangering the rest of the public.,72,,

521,0.97,3389.052,3396.393,I'm Testifying on behalf of the Washington low income housing alliance in support of Council bill 119796.,74,,
522,0.97,3396.393,3403.7,"Prior to Covid-19, Sweeps were an ineffective response at best and a deeply harmful response at worst to addressing homelessness.",74,,
523,0.97,3403.7,3412.142,"Under a global pandemic, Sweeps are even more dangerous, losing your property in a sweep can mean losing your masks or losing your tent and being exposed to Coronavirus.",74,,
524,0.97,3412.142,3421.584,It may also mean not having access to one of the city's few hygiene stations or access to food primarily since public transit is severely reduced right now.,74,,
525,0.97,3421.584,3424.521,The CDC guidance on encampment Removals is quite clear.,74,,
526,0.97,3424.521,3426.089,Here's a quote from it.,74,,
527,0.97,3426.089,3431.828,Clearing Encampments can cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers.,74,,
528,0.97,3431.828,3435.999,This increases the potential for infectious disease spread.,74,,
529,0.97,3435.999,3440.804,"Statewide since Covid-19 started, we've seen a 30% reduction in shelter capacity.",74,,
530,0.97,3440.804,3448.278,We've seen a serious slowdown in affordable housing and completion of projects and coordinated entries under staff.,74,,
531,0.97,3448.278,3451.147,So it's unconscionable right now to be doing Sweeps.,74,,
532,0.97,3451.147,3452.782,We also need to --,74,,
533,0.97,3452.782,3455.351,Thank you so much for calling in.,75,,

552,0.97,3583.78,3588.451,There were 25 folks that we've almost completely lost contact with.,80,,
553,0.97,3588.451,3592.789,One from the bridge care center.,80,,
554,0.97,3592.789,3598.428,They're in touch with now four and they were the primary case manager.,80,,
555,0.97,3598.428,3605.168,"So had we waited to be on the ground and doing their work, then I imagine we could have had better success.",80,,
556,0.97,3605.168,3617.78,We must follow CDC guidelines not to Evict and we must increase the amount of hotel space that we're providing for unsheltered folks as well as remove police from the navigation team.,80,,

561,0.97,3644.173,3653.316,"Regarding Sweeps, as you know in response to Covid-19, we had very quickly opened Lake front community House spirit village and doubled the size of Lake Union.",82,,
562,0.97,3653.316,3663.026,"As the city continues its Sweeps, we're hoping that a portion of the shelter funds from the supplemental state budget can be appropriated for more tiny House villages.",82,,
563,0.97,3663.026,3665.661,They are an immediate response to homelessness.,82,,
564,0.97,3665.661,3675.938,"We know that there are not enough shelter beds and problems exist in the traditional shelters, and our villages feel like we give people a place to heal forward.",82,,

576,0.97,3711.24,3721.384,I have seen tiny House villages have been an invaluable program since the Covid-19 crisis.,84,,

644,0.97,3939.502,3958.421,"As you have heard from me over the last week or so, we have worked to put some language together in Council bill 119783 as a Followup to legislation that we passed on May 4TH.",114,,
645,0.97,3958.421,3970.032,The bill in front of us--on accepting and appropriating state funding related to Covid-19 pandemic crisis and response including cares act.,114,,
646,0.97,3970.032,3976.238,This allows for us to allocate the remaining $1.4 million of funds through the substitute.,114,,
647,0.97,3976.238,3999.462,"This allows for us to make sure that the Cdgb funds are being spent Ideally on policies that help with redistribution of individuals who are currently in our shelter system, among a number of other strategies to help make sure people have appropriate housing and shelter to respond to the Covid crisis.",114,,
648,0.97,3999.462,4002.198,We know that $1.4 million is not a ton of money.,114,,
649,0.97,4002.198,4016.545,Our hope is that this is a down payment on the Denseification and redistribution efforts to initiate future policy discussions and funding to come from future conversations with the departments and the Mayor's office.,114,,
650,0.97,4016.545,4022.918,So that we can all work toward reducing even further Congregant shelter setting numbers.,114,,
651,0.97,4022.918,4041.47,We know that the Congregant shelters are not really considered a safe space especially given the high risk of individuals in those shelters due to underlying health conditions and their age which we know is critical for people to have appropriate public health response.,114,,
652,0.97,4041.47,4048.344,While the 1.4 that we're allocating today doesn't specifically talk about individual rooms or hotels.,114,,
653,0.97,4048.344,4059.855,I think that this will be a nice compliment to future conversations and future investments that we hope to see over the next week or two when we look at additional Federal dollars.,114,,
654,0.97,4059.855,4071.167,Our hope is that this in combination with future dollars from the executive CBO that they're evaluating right now will help us Identiy additional funds that can be used for front line homeless service providers.,114,,
655,0.97,4071.167,4088.184,"We've talked a lot about mounting costs to support Covid related response including the need for additional pay for staff, Ppe, cleaning, Foodservices, and other services as we try to serve this vulnerable Paupshz.",114,,
656,0.97,4088.184,4107.67,"In addition to the funding we already approved in the last bill, we've learned that $130 million from the Corona relief fund can also be used for a comprehensive strategy to meet both the needs for Dedenseification and can be used for rental assistance.",114,,
657,0.97,4107.67,4130.826,It's really important for us to look at the Holistic picture as these dollars come forward over the next week and make sure that we're doing both rental assistance to prevent folks from falling into homelessness and also to respond to the public health crisis and to move toward additional Defenseification and redistribution strategies.,114,,
658,0.97,4130.826,4139.902,"To date, we are aware there's Cnversations happening between homeless service providers and departments and the Mayor's office.",114,,
659,0.97,4139.902,4146.408,"We look forward to future conversations about Ppe, additional staff, cleaning, Foodservices, and housing options.",114,,
660,0.97,4146.408,4172.268,"Today again, while this is not a ton of money, the $1.4 million does signal our interest in adding additional support to Dedenseification, redistribution, even if we're not directing it toward individual rooms, we have a joint interest and expressed a shared interest in moving forward on that public health strategy and hoping to have future conversations about this with the next round of funding.",114,,
661,0.97,4172.268,4181.343,Very happy to have learned that the $130 million from the Crf or Corona release fund can be used for rental assistance.,114,,
662,0.97,4181.343,4193.122,"So colleagues, I know that was a question earlier and we'll have more opportunities to allocate additional funding as well as efforts surrounding Dedenseification and redistribution in our future funds.",114,,
663,0.97,4193.122,4203.666,Thank you all for hopefully your support as we get $1.4 million out the door to quickly deploy as much funding as we possibly can for this critical population.,114,,
664,0.97,4203.666,4210.706,It's not a ton of money as we talked about but it will make an important down payment and similar interest in future conversations.,114,,
665,0.97,4210.706,4211.106,Thank you so much.,114,,
666,0.97,4211.106,4214.51,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda, for those remarks.",115,,

670,0.97,4228.357,4229.892,I did recognize.,117,,

675,0.97,4235.731,4240.436,"I just want to, again, as I did this morning, flag my concern.",120,,
676,0.97,4240.436,4254.55,"I'm going to vote in favor of this legislation although to be very honest, I'm not sure I understand it.",120,,
677,0.97,4254.55,4266.328,We originally signaled by amending the previous bill and taking this money out of the rent assistance use.,120,,
678,0.97,4266.328,4288.317,"As a way to try to leverage some discussions with the Mayor's office, to ensure that they would embrace a different model of Deintensification of shelters, a model that does not rely on a Congregant care model but instead moves to individual rooms.",120,,
679,0.97,4288.317,4293.589,These are the safest settings for both staff and clients.,120,,
680,0.97,4293.589,4296.558,This legislation does not make that distinction.,120,,
681,0.97,4296.558,4302.331,And I understand why.,120,,
682,0.97,4302.331,4312.508,It's because the executive hasn't embraced this as a priority for its Disintensification goals.,120,,
683,0.97,4312.508,4330.459,"Nevertheless, without having accomplished that, I'm not sure why we're moving this money away from rent assistance to address the increased cost for shelter providers.",120,,
684,0.97,4330.459,4336.999,I recognize that there are those increased costs.,120,,
685,0.97,4336.999,4348.711,We have pieces of legislation that could help fund the increased cost associated with shelter as well as the increased needs of rent assistance.,120,,
686,0.97,4348.711,4379.575,"I appreciate that budget director has proposed a path forward where we can swap some funds in a future piece of legislation, but it seems very unnecessary to do that given the fact we could have just voted to put this money where it was originally prepared to be put and subsequently fund the needs associated with Deintensification of shelter and their increased costs.",120,,
687,0.97,4379.575,4388.25,"I want to recognize that just in general, I have concerns about putting off rental assistance relief.",120,,
688,0.97,4388.25,4397.926,"There are 9,000 applications received by United way of King County over a period of 48 hours and only 2,000 households received assistance.",120,,
689,0.97,4397.926,4412.174,And it's really important to note that United way of King County is able to provide rental assistance regardless of documentation of immigration status so it's a very rare source of support for this population.,120,,
690,0.97,4412.174,4436.932,I do recognize that we are going to hopefully be able to make what were the proposed efforts to fully fund the rental assistance needs in a previous legislation that there's a commitment to make those whole in a subsequent piece of legislation.,120,,
691,0.97,4436.932,4451.747,Just puzzled as to why we are taking this action given the fact there's more flexible funds available in the next week or two to address the shelter needs.,120,,
692,0.97,4451.747,4460.589,"So I'm going to provide Councilmember Mosqueda, sponsor of the bill, an opportunity to respond.",121,,
693,0.97,4460.589,4461.99,"Councilmember Mosqueda, I hand it over to you.",121,,
694,0.97,4461.99,4463.458,"Thank you, Council President.",122,,
695,0.97,4463.458,4473.402,I want to underscore and share Councilmember Herbold's frustration that we've not received confirmation that it will include individual rules.,122,,
696,0.97,4473.402,4477.806,Obviously this is a policy difference of opinion we have with the executive right now.,122,,
697,0.97,4477.806,4478.507,I will say this.,122,,
698,0.97,4478.507,4486.615,The reason I think it's important that we're putting forward the legislation and health act is some leverage has already been accomplished.,122,,
699,0.97,4486.615,4498.794,We know there's been conversations over the last week and a half that have led to the executive and the departments having conversations directly with homeless service providers.,122,,
700,0.97,4498.794,4516.345,"Prior to when this bill was originally sent down, we had heard from a number of homeless service providers that they had serious concerns about policies being advanced without checking in to see what the lay of the land was on the ground.",122,,
701,0.97,4516.345,4518.013,Those conversations have happened.,122,,
702,0.97,4518.013,4526.788,You're correct that there's still a policy difference of opinion on individual rooms which I think you and I and the CDC would argue is a good public health strategy.,122,,
703,0.97,4526.788,4532.594,"However, I think when we look at the language in front of us, it does not preclude individual rooms.",122,,
704,0.97,4532.594,4534.93,It offers it as part of the solution.,122,,
705,0.97,4534.93,4544.139,"We know in conversations with the CBO and others, they're considering an array of ways to Dedensify.",122,,
706,0.97,4544.139,4550.145,Here's I think the reality we're faced with.,122,,
707,0.97,4550.145,4557.819,We know there's $130 million from the Corona relief Fund.,122,,
708,0.97,4557.819,4568.964,"There was a real fear there wouldn't be those flexible dollars to be used for rental assistance, we had a lot of pressure to get the money out the door for rental assistance.",122,,
709,0.97,4568.964,4580.742,"We held back with the desire for, a, leverage, but B, to make sure the folks currently in shelters do see some form of Dedenseification or Deintensification.",122,,
710,0.97,4580.742,4585.614,That could include hotel rooms but could include a number of strategies they say they're working on.,122,,
711,0.97,4585.614,4592.554,Right now we know there's 500 people currently in Congregant shelters who need Dedensification strategies.,122,,
712,0.97,4592.554,4611.34,"I think by putting forward this piece of legislation, continuing to work to amplify our call for individual rooms, and I definitely want to underscore my support for that as a long-time proponent of the strategy, a part of the reason we had gone down this path was to try to urge the $1.4 million to be used for hotel rooms.",122,,
713,0.97,4611.34,4628.39,It's still not a ton of money but I think putting it forward does signal our interest in that policy discussion and it also doesn't necessarily hold back funds that could be used for helping the 500 people currently in shelters who need some level of Dedenseification.,122,,
714,0.97,4628.39,4634.863,Also I'll say the rental assistance and small businesses piece were included in the initial policy that passed.,122,,
715,0.97,4634.863,4636.932,So there was funding that went out.,122,,
716,0.97,4636.932,4654.483,"We understand there's going to be additional funding from the dollars that do come from the executive's office here soon, and we'll have the opportunity to ask whether or not that's enough rental assistance or whether it's enough assistance for folks to get out of Congregant shelter services in the future.",122,,
717,0.97,4654.483,4657.819,"I think the answer to the why now, we have $1.4 million.",122,,
718,0.97,4657.819,4674.236,We also know that's a drop in the bucket of what's needed for rental assistance and for what's needed for Deintensification since we already put money forward in this last bill for rental assistance and we know now there's more money coming from the Corona relief fund that we can use for rental assistance.,122,,
719,0.97,4674.236,4696.491,"My hope was to put the 1.4 million forward to allocate it for an array of Deintensification services to really signal our interest, council's interest in seeing those funds go into place now to help with Whomever we can with the 500 individuals who need assistance immediately and that we compliment those funds with future dollars.",122,,
720,0.97,4696.491,4700.462,I don't think the leverage has necessarily been released.,122,,
721,0.97,4700.462,4709.271,I think it's definitely initiated to conversations that had happened prior and I appreciate our joint interest in both Deintensification and rental assistance.,122,,
722,0.97,4709.271,4718.847,This effort allows for both those policies to move forward in a complimentary way.,122,,
723,0.97,4718.847,4726.455,"Any other comments on the bill, colleagues?",123,,
724,0.97,4726.455,4737.632,"Seeing no other comments on the bill, I'm going to go ahead and ask that the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill.",123,,

839,0.97,5123.818,5139.167,"Second, our immigrant community is asking for governor Inslee to work with the four corners of our state Legislature to address the systemic failure of unemployment to provide wage replacement for Undocumented workers who again pay taxes and pay into a system they cannot benefit from when they need it most.",196,,
840,0.97,5139.167,5151.246,These are important state interventions that will help many households not fall into abject poverty or have to make digs that Exponentially increase their exposure to infection of the Coronavirus.,196,,

842,0.97,5155.683,5163.958,It is heartbreaking to read in the Seattle times the Disproportionality of the population to Coronavirus infection and Covid-19 mortality rates.,196,,
843,0.97,5163.958,5174.502,"Earlier this month, Seattle times reported Washington state's black, Latinx, and Pacific Island communities have been hit.",196,,
844,0.97,5174.502,5181.876,Latinx community are seeing infection and hospitalization rates of four times the rate of white people with Covid-19.,196,,
845,0.97,5181.876,5195.089,"The trend is bearing out as well as in Illinois, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, the Bay area, as well as New York City where it is black and Latinx communities who have been hit the hardest.",196,,
846,0.97,5195.089,5202.197,"Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander communities are also seeing infection rates at four times that of white populations.",196,,
847,0.97,5202.197,5208.536,These infection rates are Impacting the same zip codes that have many barriers to economic opportunity instability.,196,,
848,0.97,5208.536,5210.905,This resolution is one way to stand with immigrant communities.,196,,
849,0.97,5210.905,5218.646,This call to action by community statewide Washington must be part of our state's Covid-19 response and recovery.,196,,
850,0.97,5218.646,5233.228,"Earlier this month, I transmitted a letter to governor Inslee asking for consideration of this fund in addition to a number of other strategies to meet the needs of our immigrant friends, family, and neighbors including those that are Undocumented.",196,,
851,0.97,5233.228,5244.939,"There's perhaps no more important time, colleagues, than now to really step up on behalf of immigrants and refugees, but in particular of those who are Undocumented.",196,,
852,0.97,5244.939,5257.752,These folks have been deemed pretty much by every single declaration and proclamation as being essential workers yet they don't seem to be essential enough to access basic benefits when needed.,196,,
853,0.97,5257.752,5273.701,"And now is the time for us to make sure that we are giving voice to these needs, voice to many individuals who cannot use their own voice for fear of retaliation as a result of their Undocumented status.",196,,
854,0.97,5273.701,5275.737,I hope that you all will support me today.,196,,
855,0.97,5275.737,5277.605,I know that you will and you have in the past.,196,,
856,0.97,5277.605,5298.493,"And I want to give a special thank you to one America, the Northwest immigrants rights network, and so many others who have always led on this work by centering voices of those who are Undocumented in the struggle for ongoing relief for this community.",196,,
857,0.97,5298.493,5306.934,"So with that being said, I am happy to advance this resolution and look forward to your support on it as well.",196,,
858,0.97,5306.934,5314.442,And I'll end my comments there and see if anyone else has any comments on the resolution before we call it to a vote.,196,,
859,0.97,5314.442,5314.976,Councilmember Mosqueda.,196,,
860,0.97,5314.976,5316.944,"Thank you, Council President.",197,,
861,0.97,5316.944,5318.946,Thank you for your leadership on this.,197,,
862,0.97,5318.946,5323.818,We're pleased to partner with you to advance this.,197,,
863,0.97,5323.818,5333.895,Really want to underscore the importance of how the crisis is disproportionately Impacting communities of color especially the refugee and immigrant community.,197,,
864,0.97,5333.895,5345.707,We know the consequences of the immigrant and refugee community and people of color being left out historically from national policy and state policy and often that's where the city of Seattle has stepped in to provide immediate relief.,197,,
865,0.97,5345.707,5358.419,"Given the crisis and the magnitude of the Covid public health crisis and the economic consequences it's created for immigrants and refugees, I think this is a critically important fund that's been requested.",197,,
866,0.97,5358.419,5367.995,We join with you and the community in demanding there be solutions for the population and that's yet again been left out from the Federal assistance dollars.,197,,
867,0.97,5367.995,5382.643,"You heard the public comment today largely focused on the relief Fund and the need for sick and safe leave, especially for populations that may be working in sort of the gray economy or the gig economy, which is no longer a segment of the economy.",197,,
868,0.97,5382.643,5384.011,It's just the economy.,197,,
869,0.97,5384.011,5389.183,"As we think about relief that needs to be provided, I think the same is true for the emergency Fund.",197,,
870,0.97,5389.183,5405.733,These are workers that are in every sector of our economy who have been historically left out and have yet again been left out of these essential funds as we not just respond but try to survive the initial impact of the crisis.,197,,
871,0.97,5405.733,5416.677,So I thank the community for the work they've done and really appreciate the work you've done to bring forward this resolution to Council to show that we are a welcoming state.,197,,
872,0.97,5416.677,5418.045,We are a welcoming city.,197,,
873,0.97,5418.045,5432.86,We advocate to fill the gaps that have been created from the state and Federal level and really appreciate the community's courageous efforts to call attention for the need for this Fund and all their public testimony today.,197,,
874,0.97,5432.86,5433.828,Thank you so much.,198,,
875,0.97,5433.828,5439.767,Any other comments from my colleagues?,198,,
876,0.97,5439.767,5446.474,"Seeing and hearing none, we will go ahead and vote on the resolution.",198,,
877,0.97,5446.474,5450.511,"Actually, I have an amendment first.",198,,
878,0.97,5450.511,5456.551,I will move to amend the resolution as presented on amendment 1 that was recently distributed.,198,,
879,0.97,5456.551,5456.984,Second.,199,,
880,0.97,5456.984,5457.351,Okay.,200,,
881,0.97,5457.351,5462.957,It's been moved and Seconded to amend the resolution.,200,,
882,0.97,5462.957,5464.959,"Colleagues, amendment 1 is very simple.",200,,
883,0.97,5464.959,5491.052,"It just adds the words ""state Legislature"" to make sure that we acknowledge that this should be a collaborative effort amongst our state Legislature and the governor in establishing a worker relief Fund so very simple resolution, very simple amendment that I see as technical in a lot of ways.",200,,
884,0.97,5491.052,5497.625,So I'm happy to answer any questions on that particular amendment but it's pretty straightforward.,200,,
885,0.97,5497.625,5500.661,Are there any comments on amendment 1?,200,,
886,0.97,5500.661,5509.804,"Seeing and hearing none, I'd ask that the clerk call the roll on amendment 1.",200,,

896,0.97,5585.646,5589.15,"Thank you, everyone, for your support of that resolution.",202,,
897,0.97,5589.15,5598.225,It will mean a lot to the immigrant and refugee population who is so desperately seeking assistance in this space.,202,,
898,0.97,5598.225,5604.065,I want to thank you all for your unanimous support in that regard.,202,,
899,0.97,5604.065,5605.099,Other business.,202,,
900,0.97,5605.099,5611.439,There is I believe two letters for consideration for signature this afternoon.,202,,
901,0.97,5611.439,5618.613,The first one is from Councilmember Juarez who described her letter regarding the South Dakota restrictions on tribal lands.,202,,
902,0.97,5618.613,5624.685,"Councilmember Juarez, would you like to add anything to your comments from this morning?",202,,
903,0.97,5624.685,5632.827,"Madam President, I do have two items, would this be the time to request my--to be excused on Tuesday, may 26th?",203,,
904,0.97,5632.827,5638.666,"Yeah, I was going to do the letters first and then have you move to be excused.",204,,
905,0.97,5638.666,5641.335,Okay.,205,,
906,0.97,5641.335,5642.136,I'll be brief.,205,,
907,0.97,5642.136,5648.142,"As I shared this morning, this is regarding the Cheyenne River, Rosebud Sioux nations.",205,,
908,0.97,5648.142,5661.455,"As I shared last week, the governor of South Dakota issued a demand that the tribal nation folks remove their security checkpoints that were set up to prevent the spread of Covid-19 on to the reservation.",205,,
909,0.97,5661.455,5675.369,The chairs of all three tribes have issued statements declaring security checkpoints were established in response to a growing concern of the novel Coronavirus and how there are no plans to take them down.,205,,
910,0.97,5675.369,5699.66,"I do want to add on a side note, I'm sure some of you have seen this in the news, it breaks my heart and it's unfortunate to share that we have doctors without borders currently on the Navajo reservation as they attempt to save the lives of their people and their residents and their citizens so we know how closely native folk live with each other and extended families.",205,,
911,0.97,5699.66,5702.897,We know how quickly this disease spreads.,205,,
912,0.97,5702.897,5735.663,"We also know that we have a population that is poised as the other Councilmembers shared earlier that it particularly affects at a disproportionate rate people of color, low income, people with Pre-Existing conditions, Elders, children, schools, and so these are the type of issues that we're facing and that combined with the lack of Indian health services to not get out the appropriate money that was designated well over a month ago that still has not reached Indian country.",205,,
913,0.97,5735.663,5750.044,I cannot stress how important this letter is and also I heard from tribal leadership that they're thankful and they're very touched that the city Council and Mayor of Seattle are going to be joining them and supporting them in their Allyship.,205,,
914,0.97,5750.044,5754.582,So I ask and thank all of you to please sign this letter of support.,205,,
915,0.97,5754.582,5755.249,"Thank you, Madam chair.",205,,
916,0.97,5755.249,5759.22,"Thank you, Councilmember Juarez, for that description.",206,,
917,0.97,5759.22,5764.959,Are there any additional comments on the letter as described by Councilmember Juarez?,206,,
918,0.97,5764.959,5778.606,"Hearing and seeing none, I would ask that the clerk please call the role on this signature to Councilmember Juarez' proposed letter.",206,,
919,0.97,5778.606,5796.757,[roll call] nine in favor.,207,,
920,0.97,5810.805,5812.84,Thank you so much.,208,,
921,0.97,5812.84,5815.342,"Councilmember Juarez, would you like to move now to be exposed?",208,,
922,0.97,5815.342,5823.117,"Yes, I'd like to request to be excused on Tuesday, may 26th.",209,,
923,0.97,5823.117,5830.057,Councilmember Juarez has moved to be excused from the May 26th city council meetings.,210,,
924,0.97,5830.057,5831.992,Are there any objections?,210,,
925,0.97,5831.992,5838.699,"Hearing no objections, Councilmember Juarez will be excused from the May 26th city council meeting.",210,,
926,0.97,5838.699,5841.468,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Juarez.",210,,
927,0.97,5841.468,5851.645,Next up is Councilmember Herbold who also has a proposed letter in support of a billed grant for the East marginal way quarter improvement project.,210,,
928,0.97,5851.645,5853.147,The floor is yours.,210,,
929,0.97,5853.147,5853.681,Thank you.,211,,
930,0.97,5853.681,5858.152,"Last Thursday, my office circulated this letter.",211,,
931,0.97,5858.152,5865.392,This letter mirrors a similar request letter that the Council signed in February for a separate Federal grant.,211,,
932,0.97,5865.392,5881.041,The city has a longstanding interest in this project and I do as well because it is critical for bike communities in West Seattle to ensure that they're separated from traffic with the closure of the West Seattle bridge through at least the end of 2021.,211,,
933,0.97,5881.041,5888.082,This quarter will become increasingly important as freight uses the lower level bridge to West Seattle as well.,211,,
934,0.97,5888.082,5896.156,The project itself will improve safety and reliability in the movement of people and goods in this industrial and Maritime area.,211,,
935,0.97,5896.156,5901.729,The legislation--the project will support freight loads by rebuilding the roadway.,211,,
936,0.97,5901.729,5908.168,It will support improved deficiency through signal modifications and intelligent transportation systems.,211,,
937,0.97,5908.168,5914.275,It will improve safety by better separating Non-Motorized loads from freight traffic.,211,,
938,0.97,5914.275,5922.349,The grant application itself is for $20 million.,211,,
939,0.97,5922.349,5927.421,The Sdot CIP project lists that Sdot was considering approaches for full funding.,211,,
940,0.97,5927.421,5929.823,Our earlier grant application was for $13 million.,211,,
941,0.97,5929.823,5934.662,The port of Seattle is also contributing $5 million for this project.,211,,
942,0.97,5934.662,5941.602,The funding gap listed in the CIP at this point is $38 million.,211,,
943,0.97,5941.602,5946.807,"So if we are successful in getting this grant, it will help us close the funding gap.",211,,
944,0.97,5946.807,5951.545,Thank you for your consideration.,211,,
945,0.97,5951.545,5953.314,Thank you so much.,212,,

951,0.97,5972.132,5975.169,So I'm going to be happily signing on.,213,,
952,0.97,5975.169,5975.436,Thank you.,213,,
