0,0.97,308.541,318.084,Is why I won't to take Councilmember Herbold out of order to allow her as a public safety chair to share remarks with us.,0,,
1,0.97,318.084,350.817,"And then very importantly I want to hear from Councilmember Mosqueda who is the chair of our budget committee, who is going to again share with us additional details about what we can expect to be our here on the city council as it relates to being Transformational in this space as is being demanded by thousands of protesters on our streets.",0,,
2,0.97,350.817,361.16,So I look forward to this morning's conversation and I look forward to the hard work that lays before us over the next several weeks and several months.,0,,
3,0.97,361.16,370.036,"So with that being said, I'm going to hand it over to Councilmember Herbold.",0,,
4,0.97,373.573,374.073,Thank you.,1,,
5,0.97,374.073,377.71,So my opening remarks are going to be pretty brief.,1,,
6,0.97,377.71,415.181,"I'm going to spend most of my time talking about the Council's actions that we have all been working on together and that I think we are going to see a lot of movement forward on a number of these actions in the next couple of days, and I will go through those, but first I do want to echo Council President Gonzales' remarks about our frustration and dismay of the events that are happening night after night.",1,,
7,0.97,415.181,429.295,"You know, acknowledging there was a short break but that continued to happen on Capitol Hill at the East precinct.",1,,
8,0.97,429.295,445.111,"Having attended a protest in the junction, attended by at least a couple thousand people on Saturday.",1,,
9,0.97,445.111,457.924,"On Sunday attending the event down at Othello Playfield, that Marchers marched to the Safeway parking lots.",1,,
10,0.97,457.924,490.49,"Those events were not--there was no element of confrontation, no element of Militarization, and to Juxtapose those events against what's happening in the East precinct really brings to mind my questions that I think we have all been asking, but have not received satisfactory responses for why--why this confrontation is happening in the East precinct.",1,,
11,0.97,490.49,531.931,"The chief and the Mayor in their press conference on Sunday evening, as well as in a telephone conversation that myself, Council President Gonzalez and Councilmember Mosqueda had with the chief on Sunday morning, referred to a credible threat from the FBI and suggested that that credible threat is coming from somebody intent on doing damage to the city of Seattle as well as other cities' infrastructure.",1,,
12,0.97,531.931,610.81,"It's unclear as to whether this is a generalized credible threat that the FBI has issued to all cities that have a proud history of civil disobedience or whether or not there's specific intelligence related to a credible threat among people protesting the death of George Floyd, but what we saw happen last night, I don't think reflects anybody's intelligence of what kind of violence could happen out at the East precinct as it related to the attempt of an individual who did not appear and does not seem to be in any way affiliated with the movement against police brutality, but the actions of that person to drive into the crowd, actions that the crowd and protesters were most effective in addressing and mitigating.",1,,
13,0.97,610.81,670.369,"It was protesters who, as has been reported to me, that took a piece of the hard barrier wall that was not securely fashioned and used a piece of the hard barrier wall to basically stop the car and as far as I can tell, there was no attempt on the behalf of police officers to detain this person and so that also brings into the question of whether or not there was an inverse proportionality, DIS proportionality as it related to Apprehending this individual who clearly had a Realtime threat intended against protesters, not against the East precinct.",1,,
14,0.97,670.369,682.815,And the chief and Mayor spoke quite a bit on Sunday evening about their efforts to be more proportional in their responses to protesters' actions.,1,,
15,0.97,682.815,743.976,"I am concerned that this is an example where there was an inverse Improportionality, that I did not see in any way which our law enforcement responded to that very real, On-The- ground threat, and so I raised that, again, because it's a question that I am hearing from the public in that it really underscores the injustice of the response that protesters are receiving the brunt of as it relates to the Department's response to activities that the Department itself identifies as shining green lasers in officers' eyes and throwing projectiles.",1,,
16,0.97,743.976,773.906,"I really strongly question whether those types of actions necessitate resumption of the use of pepper spray, which, as we learned last week, with the Mayor's and chief's order to stop using--I'm sorry, the chief's order to stop using tear gas, we now know that the exception to that ban, that 30- day ban is with the order of the chief.",1,,
17,0.97,773.906,781.28,I can only assume that last night the use of tear gas was at the order of the chief.,1,,
18,0.97,781.28,789.722,I'm going to move into remarks related specifically to Council actions this week.,1,,
19,0.97,789.722,808.174,"For Walk-On, for introduction and referral on the introduction referral Council today at full Council, I am going to be walking on an ordinance requiring that certain uniformed police officers do not cover with a morning band the serial number engraved on their badge.",1,,
20,0.97,808.174,834.5,"The fiscal NOTE itself notes that people have participated in the recent rallies and demonstrations protesting the killing of George Floyd and they have indicated that they sometimes have been unable to identify officers because they could not see a name tag and that the officer's badge, serial number was covered by a mourning band.",1,,
21,0.97,834.5,844.71,It would disallow the--this NOTE assumes that officers would continue to use the badges that have already been issued by SPD but would simply move the mourning band away from the serial number.,1,,
22,0.97,844.71,850.716,Early last week I announced my intent to introduce this legislation.,1,,
23,0.97,850.716,858.457,Subsequent to that the police chief ordered officers to display badge numbers.,1,,
24,0.97,858.457,872.771,The Mayor stated yesterday that they are still receiving reports of officers covering their badge numbers and that those will be treated as complaints to the office of police accountability and investigated as violation of policy.,1,,
25,0.97,872.771,884.083,"I do appreciate the police chief's order, but want to Enshrine it into city law so it does not depend on the policy of this chief or any future Chiefs.",1,,
26,0.97,884.083,902.668,This bill itself is amending legislation adopted in 2000 after the WTO protests which wired display of names on uniforms and this legislation was sponsored by former city Councilmember Peter Steinbrueck and this is an appropriate role for the Council.,1,,
27,0.97,902.668,908.741,A vote could be held next Monday at full council.,1,,
28,0.97,908.741,909.275,Let's see here.,1,,
29,0.97,909.275,916.115,We also have--let me Scroll down to the Safety-Related items here.,1,,
30,0.97,916.115,918.55,We have a committee meeting tomorrow morning.,1,,
31,0.97,918.55,922.788,The public safety and human services committee.,1,,
32,0.97,922.788,942.207,"We will be hearing two briefings delayed by the Covid- 19 pandemic and those are the annual reports of the office of police accountability and the office of the inspector general, the community police Commissioner was invited but they have a very heavy workload so this will need to be presented later.",1,,
33,0.97,942.207,950.416,I invite any Councilmember not on the committee to attend if they'd like to do so.,1,,
34,0.97,950.416,996.995,"And even though the stated for purposes of addressing the fact that there is--there are annual reports that the Council needs to hear, we are going to have OPA and Iog touch on those issues and give a quick overview of the content of those annual reports, but I am allowing them to Pivot the discussion in committee to really focus on the activity and engagement that they are doing right now, and I know that they are working on a number of different sets of recommendations to the Mayor and the Council and so this will be an opportunity to lift those things up.",1,,
35,0.97,996.995,1030.996,"In addition, for letters and proclamations to sign today, Councilmembers very likely heard about a local leaders letter that was sent to the Mayor and chief best yesterday and so the letter itself focuses on a few different themes.",1,,
36,0.97,1030.996,1068.0,"One, an expectation that SPD changes tactics and takes a Demilitarized stance, that we further restrict the use of excessive or deadly force by police, that we increase accountability and transparency in police Union contracts, and that we give subpoena power and other investigative powers to the independent oversight partners, and that we work to redirect Department funding to Community-Based alternatives.",1,,
37,0.97,1068.0,1072.971,"The--many folks, Councilmembers, reached out over the weekend to inquire about this letter.",1,,
38,0.97,1072.971,1088.387,I think most of you have read that the reason why it was restricted to only four Councilmembers is because of open public meetings act restrictions around coordinating majority of Councilmembers' signatures.,1,,
39,0.97,1088.387,1093.125,It is not only a letter from the four Councilmembers that signed it.,1,,
40,0.97,1093.125,1104.87,Other Councilmembers are invited to sign and I intend to do a role call request at full council today.,1,,
41,0.97,1104.87,1127.326,"And in joining the Councilmembers who have signed it, myself, Council President Gonzalez, Councilmember Mosqueda and Councilmember Morales you will be joining other local electives across jurisdictions, including the King County Council and our state Legislature.",1,,
42,0.97,1127.326,1150.716,"The second letter that on circulated last week--or actually, I guess it was over the weekend, is a letter requested that the city attorney withdraw the city of Seattle's litigation seeking to block inquest reforms initiated by the King County executive.",1,,
43,0.97,1150.716,1159.825,King County executive Constantine spoke over the weekend at the West Seattle junction rally.,1,,
44,0.97,1159.825,1202.801,"In his comments he--he called on cities not only Seattle, to withdraw lawsuits against King County inquest reforms that were developed over, I believe, about eight months with the families of Tommy Lee, Chay Taylor, John T. Williams and Charleena Lyles as well as other community groups and expert legal advisers, the community police Commission was one community group that endorsed these changes and the reformed inquest process was supposed to be put in place in 2019.",1,,
45,0.97,1202.801,1209.675,In January 2018 executive Constantine put all Inquests on hold pending the review process.,1,,
46,0.97,1209.675,1223.922,"The community police Commission as I mentioned earlier, has taken a number of stances in support of inquest reforms, including participation in inquest process review committee and a statement of support for the reforms.",1,,
47,0.97,1223.922,1240.205,"The letter, as drafted, notes that the Mayor mentioned during a meeting of the CPC last week that she was unaware of the legislation and the CPC indicated that they had no advanced notice of a city filing challenging these reforms.",1,,
48,0.97,1240.205,1261.66,For many years the inquest system operated functionally to Legitimize and Immunize all deaths in police custody because of the narrow focus on the question of whether or not police officers had felt that their safety was in danger.,1,,
49,0.97,1261.66,1279.778,"The King County executives distinguish and balanced panel led to a Communitywide conversation about possible reform to the inquest process, and I would really appreciate your consideration for signing this letter.",1,,
50,0.97,1279.778,1294.493,Let's see what else here is pressing as it related to the issues related to policing.,1,,
51,0.97,1294.493,1321.219,Mentioned earlier that we are going to be putting forward a bill related specifically to subpoena power and we have been working with the city attorney's office for a number of months before the Covid-19 emergency began.,1,,
52,0.97,1321.219,1324.923,The executive has also been engaged.,1,,
53,0.97,1324.923,1361.66,"There were a couple different approaches for how we might address the legislation related to subpoena power and the events of the day really point to the need for a subpoena power ordinance that clarifies the process for using subpoena power by our accountability partners, specifically the OPA and the Oig.",1,,
54,0.97,1361.66,1368.366,"And so I wanted to flag for folks that there is a bill, we are not quite ready to walk it on.",1,,
55,0.97,1368.366,1382.848,"It is drafted and it has had the engagement of both the law Department, the city attorney's office, the ACLU and some other external Stakeholders.",1,,
56,0.97,1382.848,1384.282,I think that covers--I'm Scrolling here.,1,,
57,0.97,1384.282,1392.09,I think that covers the public safety items that I wanted to report upon.,1,,
58,0.97,1392.09,1402.033,"Just for purposes of finishing up my report related to other items, there's premium pay legislation on the full council agenda today.",1,,
59,0.97,1402.033,1413.845,I am going to defer to Councilmember Lewis to speak to that as the prime sponsor of that legislation.,1,,
60,0.97,1413.845,1426.958,"And we have had engagement with the labor Stakeholders around the steps that we are going to be taking moving forward, but, again, like I said, I am going to defer to Councilmember Lewis to address those.",1,,
61,0.97,1426.958,1430.896,I addressed my committee meeting items for tomorrow.,1,,
62,0.97,1430.896,1443.508,"Just as far as an update from the human services Department, the National Guard has extended placements with food lifeline to support food distribution efforts to the end of June.",1,,
63,0.97,1443.508,1447.846,The extension will be reduced level of staffing from previous months.,1,,
64,0.97,1447.846,1457.856,And the National Guard has been reaching out to each food and meal program and working with them and the Eoc to find volunteer replacements as they ramp down.,1,,
65,0.97,1457.856,1461.793,92 sites applied to the summer food service program today.,1,,
66,0.97,1461.793,1474.306,"52 of which are Seattle public school sites, Hsd, the human services Department is now developing safety guidelines and hiring critical summer staff.",1,,
67,0.97,1474.306,1502.667,"This week, on Wednesday, we are going to be having the first meeting of the West Seattle bridge community task force, that will be Co-Chaired by former city of Seattle Mayor Greg nickels and community activist advocate Extraordinaire from South Park, Paulina Lopez.",1,,
68,0.97,1502.667,1516.648,"And this week Thursday, coming up, we are also having the lead policy coordinating groups' quarterly meeting.",1,,
69,0.97,1516.648,1525.757,There continues to be concerns around the referrals to the new Co-Lead program.,1,,
70,0.97,1525.757,1535.133,I really appreciate that the executive has worked through the contracting issues.,1,,
71,0.97,1535.133,1540.538,"Now, there are challenging issues associated with Co-Lead receiving referrals from the police Department.",1,,
72,0.97,1540.538,1547.846,They are challenging and understandable given the police Department's focus right now.,1,,
73,0.97,1547.846,1564.529,But they are challenges that I think are challenges that can be addressed with other ways of getting Co-Lead referrals to lead and feel free to ask me more about that as well.,1,,
74,0.97,1564.529,1566.398,And that is all I have for today.,1,,
75,0.97,1566.398,1569.401,Happy to take any questions.,1,,
76,0.97,1569.401,1573.939,"You it, Councilmember Herbold, for that report.",2,,
77,0.97,1573.939,1581.546,"Colleagues, any questions or comments for Councilmember Herbold?",2,,
78,0.97,1581.546,1583.248,Councilmember Mosqueda I see your hand up.,2,,
79,0.97,1583.248,1583.481,Please.,2,,
80,0.97,1583.481,1590.822,"Were you given any additional information about the escalation last night and I want to thank Councilmember Sawant, I know you were out in the streets as well.",3,,
81,0.97,1590.822,1597.362,A lot of folks were mentioning your live stream Video and that you also experienced getting gas.,3,,
82,0.97,1597.362,1604.235,"I want to know, Councilmember Herbold, did you get any sort of clarification from the chief or the Mayor about what led to that escalation officially?",3,,
83,0.97,1604.235,1638.603,"I did not receive any official communications about The-I did not personally but I did read that the position of the Department, because of the statements that were going out, the position of the Department was that the escalation happened because of projectiles, including what they said were Incendiary devices, they believe they were candles.",4,,
84,0.97,1638.603,1640.505,I don't know.,4,,
85,0.97,1640.505,1655.687,"But again, the escalation to the level that we saw did seem, again, to be very disproportionate to what officers--or what the Department was reporting was occurring.",4,,
86,0.97,1655.687,1664.729,"There was a report of injuries of six officers, including two that reportedly also went to the hospital.",4,,
87,0.97,1664.729,1671.336,I don't have independent information about that.,4,,
88,0.97,1671.336,1690.689,"I was monitoring SPD's live Twitter feed in their Realtime explanation for why, from their perspective, the actions were called for.",4,,
89,0.97,1690.689,1699.998,"But, again, there's the question of DIS proportionality that we have been asking to.",4,,
90,0.97,1699.998,1720.719,The reasons not conveyed to me personally but the reasons that the Department gave publicly to--for us all to read for why they were--why the chief apparently authorized OC spray and why they proceeded with flash bangs and pepper spray.,4,,
91,0.97,1720.719,1725.023,I'd like to respond to this directly because I was there myself.,5,,
92,0.97,1725.023,1726.057,"Yeah, Yeah.",6,,
93,0.97,1726.057,1732.597,"I saw you put--pull--put your hand up, Councilmember Sawant, intending to call on you next.",6,,
94,0.97,1732.597,1747.378,"So Councilmember Sawant and again if anyone else wants to make a comment or have questions for Councilmember Herbold, you need to raise your hands if you're on Video or you can use the raise your hand feature on zoom by clicking on participants and then raising your hand that way.",6,,
95,0.97,1747.378,1749.481,"Councilmember Sawant, the floor is yours.",6,,
96,0.97,1749.481,1749.914,Thank you.,7,,
97,0.97,1749.914,1759.758,"I have other comments to make, obviously, but just to respond to this question that Councilmember Mosqueda asked about what was the provocation.",7,,
98,0.97,1759.758,1774.139,"There was no provocation and the reason I am able to testify to this is because I was on the front line, literally on the front line, just a few feet away from the first line of the police force.",7,,
99,0.97,1774.139,1798.663,"And there were no projectiles, no Incendiary devices, nothing harmful, and as I will explain later, this is absolute gas lighting because these are police that were donned in top to bottom riot gear and they were faced with ordinary people with nothing other than some of them having, you know, homemade face shields from Cutout plastic water bottles.",7,,
100,0.97,1798.663,1819.817,"That is all that people had for their protection and all the weaponry was on the side of the police force, and there is absolutely no question that the Seattle police Department and chief best and Mayor Durkan are responsible for wanton and vicious violence.",7,,
101,0.97,1819.817,1825.056,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant, for that additional information.",8,,
102,0.97,1825.056,1841.539,Are there any other questions or comments for Councilmember Herbold or just about that policing subject?,8,,
103,0.97,1841.539,1847.979,I'm not seeing anyone raise their hand.,9,,
104,0.97,1847.979,1848.179,Okay.,9,,
105,0.97,1848.179,1849.581,"Councilmember Strauss, please.",9,,
106,0.97,1849.581,1850.882,"Thank you, Council President.",10,,
107,0.97,1850.882,1856.02,I do have comments to make but I can hold them for my own section if preferred.,10,,
108,0.97,1856.02,1856.254,No.,11,,
109,0.97,1856.254,1858.756,We have a couple of options.,11,,
110,0.97,1858.756,1868.466,"I think, if you want to make comments about the police response, now would be the time to do that.",11,,
111,0.97,1868.466,1876.507,You will also have another opportunity to make comment related to the police response after Councilmember Mosqueda's report.,11,,
112,0.97,1876.507,1892.09,So perhaps that might be a better opportunity and we will have the benefit of both a public and us having sort of the full context of some of the thinking and work that I think the city council is going to have before us in the coming weeks.,11,,
113,0.97,1892.09,1894.826,"Why don't we plan on doing that, if that's okay.",11,,
114,0.97,1894.826,1896.461,"Yes, that sounds great.",12,,
115,0.97,1896.461,1896.761,Thank you.,12,,
116,0.97,1896.761,1897.061,Great.,13,,
117,0.97,1897.061,1897.295,Okay.,13,,
118,0.97,1897.295,1908.673,"So with that being said, colleagues, I am going to go ahead and yield over to Councilmember Mosqueda who is next up on the role call list.",13,,
119,0.97,1908.673,1922.153,This will be an opportunity for us to round out the conversation around many of these policing issues.,13,,
120,0.97,1922.153,1939.103,I continue to believe that we really need to push ourselves to think about how to think in a Transformational way as it relates to funding of law enforcement and of delivery of public safety.,13,,
121,0.97,1939.103,1948.913,"And when we are having this conversation, I oftentimes think to myself, when we talk about public safety, we don't talk about for whom public safety is designed in the city.",13,,
122,0.97,1948.913,1984.248,"And it is clear to me that what we are hearing from protesters and from members of the black community here and across the country is that the way that our public safety models are currently designed, do not serve the purpose of making our black brothers and sisters feel safe, and that is, you know, obviously something that we have an opportunity to Cue up a conversation about.",13,,
123,0.97,1984.248,1988.619,It is a basic function of the city of Seattle to deliver public safety services.,13,,
124,0.97,1988.619,2028.059,"And we get to have a conversation both from a policy perspective and from a fiscal perspective about what we want our public safety model to look like--in the past few weeks we have been talking about what we don't want it to be but we have an opportunity to shift and Pivot about what we want our public safety model to look like and really begin to define who it is we want this public safety model to truly, meaningfully serve, so I am excited about the opportunity to have this conversation and I think it's an important conversation.",13,,
125,0.97,2028.059,2043.408,"It will come with its challenges, but I think these are challenges that are worth taking on and I am--I am glad and honored that I have an opportunity to do that with this group of people on this current city council.",13,,
126,0.97,2043.408,2049.981,"So with that being said, I'm going to hand it over to Councilmember Mosqueda and our budget chair.",13,,
127,0.97,2049.981,2050.548,"Please, take it away.",13,,
128,0.97,2056.087,2057.822,Thank you.,14,,
129,0.97,2057.822,2060.057,Can you hear me?,14,,
130,0.97,2060.057,2062.093,"Thank you, council colleagues, thank you Council President.",14,,
131,0.97,2062.093,2072.07,I think what we have heard over the last few weeks here in Seattle and frankly calls have gone unanswered in years and decades prior.,14,,
132,0.97,2072.07,2081.279,"We have done many things in the city of Seattle to reform our public safety efforts and I want to thank the folks, including Council President Gonzalez who really helped to lead on these issues.",14,,
133,0.97,2081.279,2087.752,What we are hearing from community right now is that our residents do not feel safe in our own city from our police.,14,,
134,0.97,2087.752,2091.456,Today I am using my privilege to change this.,14,,
135,0.97,2091.456,2097.328,As budget chair today I'm announcing we will be launching an Iquest into Seattle police Department's budget.,14,,
136,0.97,2097.328,2103.201,"Unlike past practices, we are not going to Nibble around the edges of the Mayor's proposed budget.",14,,
137,0.97,2103.201,2119.25,"We will now make a statement that this year we are not going to pass the Mayor's 2020 revised budget until we as a Council have a chance to get a full, thorough and simultaneous transparent deep dive into the Seattle public--Seattle police Department's funding.",14,,
138,0.97,2119.25,2125.49,We want this to be part of this month's conversation around our budget as a city council.,14,,
139,0.97,2125.49,2132.797,I expect the full cooperation of the city departments who can often only share with us what the executive has allowed them to share.,14,,
140,0.97,2132.797,2157.255,"And I am committed to Defunding the police, to using most of that money, 50%, ideally to invest back into communities that we failed creating an Antiracist, low barrier housing option, investing equitable transit, providing permanent support of housing, providing housing options of survivors of domestic violence and shelter for the thousands of people in our Street who are unsheltered.",14,,
141,0.97,2157.255,2166.23,Many of us have already asked what our current budget is and many people have been frustrated by the black box that is the Seattle police Department's current budget.,14,,
142,0.97,2166.23,2175.306,"We know we have over $400 million in that bucket and we want to know as many councils have asked, what is the current cost going to?",14,,
143,0.97,2175.306,2178.442,Specifically what has the cost been over the last week and a half?,14,,
144,0.97,2178.442,2179.977,How much has this escalation cost us?,14,,
145,0.97,2179.977,2188.052,"How much have we spent on tear gas, rubber bullets, Jailing people, like the young man who recorded the 9-Year-Old getting tear gassed.",14,,
146,0.97,2188.052,2190.655,He was arrested and remains in jail today.,14,,
147,0.97,2190.655,2201.265,Many of us have asked what the cost is of continuing to train folks to travel to learn from other areas of the world about escalation strategies.,14,,
148,0.97,2201.265,2204.869,We want to know why we haven't applied the lessons of the WTO.,14,,
149,0.97,2204.869,2222.42,"There was an inquest done, there were strategies learned, there was costs and analysis of Whther or not it was the right thing to do and from just a fiscally conservative perspective, it was the wrong thing to do when you look at how many people were paid out because the city was in the wrong.",14,,
150,0.97,2222.42,2223.721,That was during the WTO.,14,,
151,0.97,2223.721,2227.224,There was a reason that they stopped using cs gas.,14,,
152,0.97,2227.224,2234.932,We want to know what those lessons learned were and why we have not applied those mechanisms to the current budget.,14,,
153,0.97,2234.932,2248.246,"We want to know how many individuals have experienced, I guess, hardship and will be filing or have already filed grievances against the police and what we expect that cost to be.",14,,
154,0.97,2248.246,2252.149,But we have to recognize that Defunding the police is not the end of the problem.,14,,
155,0.97,2252.149,2265.162,"We need to continue to invest in Black-Led organizers, Black- led organizations.",14,,

157,0.97,2270.067,2274.805,"They have places ready to go if they just had additional funding for housing, could House many of our community members.",14,,
158,0.97,2274.805,2289.086,"I am committed to doing this with all of you and by doing so, July 17th of this year, so that we can work with Seattle residents to ensure that the 2021 and 2022 budget fully reflects our community needs.",14,,
159,0.97,2289.086,2306.904,"I'm calling on our community to work with us as the city council launches this simultaneous transparent deep dive into the Seattle police Department's policies, funding and procedures so that we can begin this conversation in June with suggested changes by July.",14,,
160,0.97,2306.904,2320.484,We know that we have a serious crisis in our Street right now and we are calling on the Mayor and SPD to immediately cease the use of weapons against our residents or anyone who chooses to protest in the city.,14,,
161,0.97,2320.484,2324.588,"It seems--in this seems drastic to you, let me tell you why we need it.",14,,
162,0.97,2324.588,2330.961,"Our police Department, as we have seen last night and the night before and the night before that, is using weapons of war on our own residents.",14,,
163,0.97,2330.961,2336.901,I heard reports last night of people being three stories up and not being able to breathe because of the gas.,14,,
164,0.97,2336.901,2343.14,Last week we heard a story of the 3-Month-Old baby who was foaming at the mouth.,14,,
165,0.97,2343.14,2352.983,"We heard other stories subsequently reported in the ""Seattle times"" of 6-Month-Old babies sitting in hallways with their parents trying to seek refuge for fresh air because their apartments were filled with gas.",14,,
166,0.97,2352.983,2360.825,This is a crisis that we must respond to and we also have to recognize that we have a budget that allows for us to maintain controls over these efforts.,14,,
167,0.97,2360.825,2382.046,I also want to know that I support the legislation that's being put forward today by Councilmember Sawant to ban these materials so these can get out of our hands but as a budgetary item we also have control over identifying where our dollars go to make sure it better Aligns with our values.,14,,
168,0.97,2382.046,2385.983,All of this has been sanctioned by the executive.,14,,
169,0.97,2385.983,2394.525,"Just one day after we commit to no tear gas, protesters in the street experienced pepper spray.",14,,
170,0.97,2394.525,2403.868,Yesterday the executive said she and the chief were going to De-Escalate and last night's headlines read this is the most aggressive form of tactics used in the last week and a half.,14,,
171,0.97,2403.868,2411.175,Across this country people are looking for a change and here in Seattle we have the opportunity for true progressive leadership.,14,,
172,0.97,2411.175,2414.478,We have headed in the opposite director today.,14,,
173,0.97,2414.478,2422.286,"There's other headlines saying that as other cities have Deescalated and pulled back their force, Seattle is going in the opposite direction.",14,,
174,0.97,2422.286,2433.13,"Instead of working on the systems that create inequity and municipal government is one of those systems, we instead are turning--we instead turn our backs on our own residents.",14,,
175,0.97,2435.232,2438.969,The responsibility of being an elected official is protecting our residents.,14,,
176,0.97,2438.969,2440.237,It's not tear gassing them.,14,,
177,0.97,2440.237,2443.274,It's not pepper spraying them.,14,,
178,0.97,2443.274,2444.642,It's not deploying rubber bullets on them.,14,,
179,0.97,2444.642,2454.118,"Yes, I was out on Capitol Hill on Saturday and I want to thank all the Councilmembers who were out there and the state, senators and state representatives and the King County Councilmembers.",14,,
180,0.97,2454.118,2458.656,We should not have to be out there to prevent people from getting sprayed.,14,,
181,0.97,2458.656,2462.126,Councilmember Sawant was out there yesterday and she experienced spray herself.,14,,
182,0.97,2462.126,2463.561,When is this going to stop?,14,,
183,0.97,2463.561,2465.463,That's the Email that I have been receiving.,14,,
184,0.97,2465.463,2470.067,Those are the calls and the text messages I have been receiving in the middle of the night.,14,,
185,0.97,2470.067,2473.771,People just want this to stop.,14,,
186,0.97,2473.771,2487.818,"I made a decision to leave my infant sleeping, my baby sleeping in her crib because I was thinking about that individual who was experiencing the type of tear gas with their own Kiddo sleeping in their crib.",14,,
187,0.97,2487.818,2496.594,"You know, we have community residents who have been riding us over the last two weeks talking about, maybe it's time for additional reforms and then it went to, it is time to Defund the police.",14,,
188,0.97,2496.594,2505.87,"Then it went to, we have got to have major radical change from the leadership because this is not working and there needs to be change now.",14,,
189,0.97,2505.87,2515.613,I heard folks out on Saturday night that said that they were happy that there were Councilmembers there because they believed that it stopped the situation from escalating.,14,,
190,0.97,2515.613,2521.685,But we cannot afford to try to put ourselves between black and Brown bodies every night.,14,,
191,0.97,2521.685,2526.724,Councilmember Sawant tried that last night and there was still gas.,14,,
192,0.97,2526.724,2535.733,"Colleagues in Minneapolis, they have said that they used to believe that reform was needed and now they have completely dismantled.",14,,
193,0.97,2535.733,2540.671,They are in the process to completely dismantle their police system.,14,,
194,0.97,2540.671,2545.142,They are working with black and Brown community members to start from the ground up.,14,,
195,0.97,2545.142,2562.726,We have seen Minneapolis do similar structural changes in their police Department and their Council President has continued to say that they knew that they needed to do more and they are taking this effort to radically change what policing looks like and to reinvest the community.,14,,
196,0.97,2562.726,2566.797,Wednesday during our budget committee begins that process.,14,,
197,0.97,2566.797,2576.774,Wednesday during that budget process we will get to the black box that is the Seattle police Department's budget and we can begin our process here in Seattle to Replicate what Minneapolis is doing.,14,,
198,0.97,2576.774,2579.176,I disagree with the Mayor's statement yesterday.,14,,
199,0.97,2579.176,2587.718,She said that she thought we had the foundation to make changes on our existing system and that it did not need to be dismantled and built from the ground up.,14,,
200,0.97,2587.718,2588.085,I disagree.,14,,
201,0.97,2588.085,2593.557,I think we need to Replicate what Minneapolis has done and I think we need to do that as a Cohort together.,14,,
202,0.97,2593.557,2612.142,"It begins on Wednesday by looking at the investments that we have already put forward in the Seattle police Department's budget identifying how individuals can be more focused on social services, retraining to provide mental health services.",14,,
203,0.97,2612.142,2624.888,"Minneapolis is leading the way in many ways, by spurring us to take to the streets and now through this policy action led by black and Brown communities to radically reform their police Department.",14,,
204,0.97,2624.888,2627.091,We cannot wait for others to lead.,14,,
205,0.97,2627.091,2642.74,"When taxpayers have used their--have had their tax dollars used against them in the form of police violence, when residents are told that they cannot be on the streets they voted for and paid for, we are disconnected from Seattle if we think we can't have radical change right now.",14,,
206,0.97,2642.74,2648.412,"There is a vacuum of true leadership and doing hard things, colleagues, let's fill that void.",14,,
207,0.97,2648.412,2652.883,Let's be the leaders that this moment calls for.,14,,
208,0.97,2652.883,2669.833,"But as community of color led organizations and leaders from communities of color have told us, especially within the last 24 hours, a change in office or a change in a Figurehead without radical change to the institution that is policing is not Transformational.",14,,
209,0.97,2669.833,2692.322,"That's why I am offering Council colleagues that we focus over the next six weeks on replicating both what Minneapolis has done, transforming our police system, and addressing what will be coming down to us as an austerity budget for us to have a chance to truly provide leadership in responding to Covid and providing public safety and providing public health and transforming our system.",14,,
210,0.97,2692.322,2695.259,The Demandsthat have been made from the community have gone unmet.,14,,
211,0.97,2695.259,2701.598,And I want to be clear that those demands were included in that letter that Councilmember Herbold Referenced.,14,,
212,0.97,2701.598,2712.943,"A number of city Councilmembers continue to sign onto that letter, including state legislators from the entire region and our King County partners.",14,,
213,0.97,2712.943,2722.386,We are talking about a Sign-On letter from almost every elected official in our region who is asking our city to De- escalate.,14,,
214,0.97,2722.386,2724.455,Demands that are both near term and long term.,14,,
215,0.97,2724.455,2728.726,Let me focus on the near-term demands that have gone unmet.,14,,
216,0.97,2728.726,2735.899,"The common sense short-term request or to De-Escalate, they were only met with greater escalation last night.",14,,
217,0.97,2735.899,2737.201,Promises have been broken.,14,,
218,0.97,2737.201,2744.608,These include do not use respiratory irritants during a deadly public health pandemic.,14,,
219,0.97,2744.608,2752.149,"During a deadly health pandemic that affects the lungs, do not use any irritants to the lungs, pepper spray is included in that.",14,,
220,0.97,2752.149,2758.822,We saw flash bangs used last night.,14,,
221,0.97,2758.822,2761.759,"We saw tear gas used, we heard reports of rubber bullets.",14,,
222,0.97,2761.759,2767.965,These are part of the demands that the letter included from these elected officials across the region.,14,,
223,0.97,2767.965,2778.041,"And for goodness Sakes, stop hunting down and arresting people days after they participated in a protest and putting them in jail during a public health crisis.",14,,
224,0.97,2778.041,2783.981,We heard stories of an individual being dragged out of her car in front of her child and arrested for participating.,14,,
225,0.97,2783.981,2798.662,"We have heard the story of the reporter--or I'm sorry, the individual who recorded the 9- year-old getting Maced last Saturday now being arrested and he's still in jail waiting for the 230 hearing to happen.",14,,
226,0.97,2798.662,2805.135,These are just the short-term demands that have gone unmet and had promises broken.,14,,
227,0.97,2805.135,2819.883,"The longer-term demands, again, come directly from Black-Led organizations and I think it bears repeating, Defund the Seattle city police, reinvest in health and safety for our communities and do not prosecute protesters.",14,,
228,0.97,2819.883,2833.23,"The list of demands that we have seen posted from community black led organizations in the community say to stop the violence, the police must be reduced in size, budget and scope.",14,,
229,0.97,2833.23,2836.5,The police are rooted in violence against black people.,14,,
230,0.97,2836.5,2846.543,"In order to protect black lives, this movement calls for investing in and expanding our safety net and well-being beyond policing.",14,,
231,0.97,2846.543,2854.051,That's why a number of elected leaders signed onto that letter with the hopes that there would be De-Escalation.,14,,
232,0.97,2854.051,2854.384,There wasn't.,14,,
233,0.97,2854.384,2858.889,There was just more escalation last night.,14,,
234,0.97,2858.889,2864.928,"So I asked, how many people need to write in about being gassed in their own homes?",14,,
235,0.97,2864.928,2875.873,How many people have to be sprayed in the street every night or experienced getting hit with flash bombs or rubber bullets.,14,,
236,0.97,2875.873,2882.679,How many police have to call for the police to be Defunded for you to consider resigning or for the Mayor to embrace radical change?,14,,
237,0.97,2882.679,2890.12,"I think the Mayor should assess in this moment, ask herself if she is the ride leader and resign.",14,,
238,0.97,2890.12,2898.996,"Regardless of whether she does that, regardless of the specific tactics, it's clear we need to elevate the urgency and the scale of the change that is needed.",14,,
239,0.97,2898.996,2905.335,The problem is that the weapons that the police are using are not illegal necessarily.,14,,
240,0.97,2905.335,2911.275,"The tactics they have been trained on, the riot gear has been paid for by us.",14,,
241,0.97,2911.275,2920.384,We have allowed them as a city to grow into the entity that they are.,14,,
242,0.97,2920.384,2932.562,"We have continued to invest in the very system that is now being criticized, and we have continued to--so I think that is the question in front of us.",14,,
243,0.97,2932.562,2937.901,How are we going to take ownership over the budget?,14,,
244,0.97,2937.901,2939.269,Let's do that beginning on Wednesday.,14,,
245,0.97,2939.269,2941.505,Let's look at the changes we need.,14,,
246,0.97,2941.505,2947.144,Let's work with black and Brown-Led community organizations to recognize that we cannot wait for action.,14,,
247,0.97,2947.144,2948.278,We are done asking for things.,14,,
248,0.97,2948.278,2954.718,"We are going to take bold action into our own hands, rooted in community of color led organization demands.",14,,
249,0.97,2954.718,2960.29,"We will follow their advice to reinvest in the health, stability and safety of our residents.",14,,
250,0.97,2960.29,2962.259,We will change material conditions to improve lives.,14,,
251,0.97,2962.259,2977.374,We are going to begin that process on Wednesday of Defunding the Seattle police Department's budget and examining and reassessing the overall proposed budget that will begin to allow for us to correct any austerity cuts.,14,,
252,0.97,2977.374,2990.754,"Seattle, if you watched over the last two years and then an outrage about babies being separated from their parents at the border, and thankful that we were up here in Progressive Seattle.",14,,
253,0.97,2990.754,3002.933,"If you have wept at deportation hearings, seeing children being removed from their parents or being prosecuted as a Stand- alone child and thought, I'm glad things are different here, this is your moment.",14,,
254,0.97,3002.933,3013.643,We are now in a situation where in Seattle--days of being exposed to tear gas and children are being pepper sprayed in the face.,14,,
255,0.97,3013.643,3020.217,Parents are having to pour milk over their child's eyes to solve for the violation of exercising their right to call for change.,14,,
256,0.97,3020.217,3027.19,Children are being witness to their parents getting pulled from their cars and arrested in front of them for participating in protests.,14,,
257,0.97,3027.19,3051.248,"As we reassess our Seattle police Department budget and overall investments for the city, I hope that we can do this by being led by black and Brown community members' commands that were included in that letter and that we take this as a real moment that it is, to be truly Transformational in how we invest in our communities.",14,,
258,0.97,3051.248,3051.681,And we Prioritize.,14,,
259,0.97,3051.681,3056.653,You saw from me on Friday a memo that summarizes the process.,14,,
260,0.97,3056.653,3065.195,"Be prepared for an overview of what's in the proposed budget coming down tomorrow, and Wednesday will be our first chance to get into it.",14,,
261,0.97,3065.195,3092.255,We have reserved every Wednesday from now until Mid- July for us to have the budget discussion and revenue discussions and it's been increasingly obvious that we need to carve out time during that agenda to specifically identify the spending--the spending proposals in the SPD budget from the past so we can make changes for the future.,14,,
262,0.97,3092.255,3093.824,"Thank you, Councilmember.",14,,
263,0.97,3093.824,3127.524,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda for those powerful words and your own testimony on the current events happening in our city right now and I think it is powerful for us to remember that the same chemical agents that are being used in our city were the chemical agents and the tactics that were being decried by so many Seattleites and this administration that were being used at the Southern border when families were being separated and children were being put in cages.",15,,
264,0.97,3127.524,3136.533,That tear gas that was used by the Trump administration on the U.S./Mexico border is the same tear gas we are using in Capitol Hill.,15,,
265,0.97,3136.533,3138.735,So who are we as a city?,15,,
266,0.97,3138.735,3140.337,Who do we want to be?,15,,
267,0.97,3140.337,3142.606,Who do we think we are?,15,,
268,0.97,3142.606,3155.652,These are the questions that I think are before us and we have an opportunity to answer those questions clearly and be on the right side of history in this moment.,15,,
269,0.97,3155.652,3164.661,And I am just mad that we cannot seem to appreciate the fact that this isn't other people's problem.,15,,
270,0.97,3164.661,3167.23,"This is our problem, racism exists in Seattle.",15,,
271,0.97,3167.23,3173.47,"And if you don't think racism exists in Seattle, you are just wrong.",15,,
272,0.97,3173.47,3183.246,These tactics that are being used in Capitol Hill are tactics that are prohibited in other countries.,15,,
273,0.97,3183.246,3194.991,They are also tactics that are used by the Trump administration that continues to be decried by every single progressive living in the city of Seattle and every re-elected official in this city.,15,,
274,0.97,3194.991,3201.698,"This is the moment, this is a moment for us to rise to the occasion and say, no more.",15,,
275,0.97,3201.698,3202.332,We are done.,15,,
276,0.97,3202.332,3230.06,"And I am tired of negotiating with people who don't seem inclined to negotiate, who don't want to listen to the cries of dozens of elected officials who have now asked publicly that this administration not just act proportionately to what's happening in the streets, but actually stand down.",15,,
277,0.97,3230.06,3232.629,Other cities are standing down.,15,,
278,0.97,3232.629,3257.02,"We, instead, are sending in more troops and doubling down on tactics that are clearly rooted in violence and designed to oppress people's rights to demand that police violence against black people end here at home and across the country.",15,,
279,0.97,3257.02,3274.271,"I want to fully endorse as the President of this Council, but also, more importantly, as a resident, a longtime resident of the city of Seattle, as an American and as a woman of color, I want to endorse this process.",15,,
280,0.97,3274.271,3276.306,It is not going to be easy.,15,,
281,0.97,3276.306,3287.55,"We will experience an incredible amount of challenge, but I believe that we have the sentiment and the will of the people behind us.",15,,
282,0.97,3287.55,3299.729,"And as people who are all independent elected, some in districts and some citywide, we have an obligation to respond to those calls for swift, immediate and Transformational action.",15,,
283,0.97,3299.729,3303.233,I don't think we are talking about reform anymore.,15,,
284,0.97,3303.233,3305.602,I don't think we are talking about reform anymore.,15,,
285,0.97,3305.602,3339.002,"And as a civil rights attorney, as somebody who comes to this position as a civil rights attorney, as somebody who spent over a decade suing police agencies across the state, including the Seattle police Department, I have spent my entire life trying to correct injustices, trying to find an opportunity to correct violence against black and Brown folks across the state who were subjected to police violence.",15,,
286,0.97,3339.002,3345.942,"I have nonetheless been committed over the last several years to reform, to thinking that this is something we can fix.",15,,
287,0.97,3345.942,3357.12,"And I have now come to a place to believe that you can't fix what is fundamentally broken, what appears to be fundamentally broken.",15,,
288,0.97,3357.12,3360.356,And so I stand with Councilmember Mosqueda.,15,,
289,0.97,3360.356,3386.182,"I want to stand with, more importantly, in solidarity with black led organizations and members of the black community, both in our city and across the state and across the country in this call to transform policing as we know it in America and as we know it here in the city of Seattle.",15,,
290,0.97,3386.182,3396.493,So thank you Councilmember Mosqueda for laying out the opportunity that we will have before us and I will now open up the floor to comments and questions from any other of my colleagues.,15,,
291,0.97,3404.834,3407.237,"Councilmember Herbold, the floor is yours.",15,,
292,0.97,3407.237,3440.236,"Very briefly, I want to say as the public safety chair of the city council I too am supportive and stand with budget chair Teresa Mosqueda in her call for an inquest on the police Department budget and our efforts over the next six weeks to not reform, but Reimagine and reinvent what public safety looks like in our city.",16,,
293,0.97,3440.236,3440.537,Thank you.,16,,
294,0.97,3440.537,3444.974,"Colleagues, any other comments or questions?",17,,
295,0.97,3444.974,3445.508,Councilmember Strauss?,17,,
296,0.97,3445.508,3462.258,"Thank you, Council President . apologies for me needing a moment to collect myself.",18,,
297,0.97,3462.258,3462.959,No apologies necessary.,19,,
298,0.97,3462.959,3469.432,I am thankful for the oversight process we have in our city because it will be put to the stress test at this time.,20,,
299,0.97,3469.432,3482.212,I showed up with other Councilmembers to De-Escalate the situation at 11th and pine on Saturday night because I believed we had received assurances that the gas would not be used against residents.,20,,
300,0.97,3482.212,3491.688,We cannot continue to use disproportionate force of gas and grenades against residents peacefully assembling and exercising their first amendment rights.,20,,
301,0.97,3491.688,3501.03,"I was told tear gas would not be used yet what I saw was a fog in the streets that attacked and irritated people's eyes, throats and respiratory systems.",20,,
302,0.97,3501.03,3516.246,"If you want to split hairs with me and tell me that the serial number on the device that you used is not the device you stated that would not be used, yet you achieved the same outcomes.",20,,
303,0.97,3516.246,3516.746,You're not fooling me.,20,,
304,0.97,3516.746,3523.419,We cannot continue to use gas grenades and spray on the residents in the face of peaceful assembly.,20,,
305,0.97,3523.419,3532.128,Commitments are hollow and trust is broken if the actions are not aligned with--if the actions at night are not aligned with the words said in the day.,20,,
306,0.97,3532.128,3538.034,You might feel a bit of tension from me this morning because I was up until 4:00 A.M.,20,,
307,0.97,3538.034,3539.469,Watching what occurred last night.,20,,
308,0.97,3539.469,3545.642,I got to spend most of Sunday marching with black community from the Nfl Playfield.,20,,
309,0.97,3545.642,3546.342,"It was peaceful, joyful.",20,,
310,0.97,3546.342,3548.244,"I didn't say much, didn't post anything.",20,,
311,0.97,3548.244,3550.68,I was there to listen.,20,,
312,0.97,3550.68,3555.685,I understand that I will never understand what it is like to be black in America.,20,,
313,0.97,3555.685,3557.854,I do understand that I have a lot to learn.,20,,
314,0.97,3557.854,3567.897,My ears are open and I am ready to take the direction of our community to ensure that we have a better Seattle tomorrow.,20,,
315,0.97,3567.897,3569.365,Better Seattle today.,20,,
316,0.97,3569.365,3574.437,We will be funding Community- based solutions that our community is requesting.,20,,
317,0.97,3574.437,3580.276,The organizing I witnessed in Othello was and is separate from what we are seeing on Capitol Hill.,20,,
318,0.97,3580.276,3588.451,"It is separated by time, space, people organizing, desires for outcomes and so much more.",20,,
319,0.97,3588.451,3597.26,I was heartened when I returned from Othello to watch the Mayor's press conference last night and believe that we would have a peaceful night.,20,,
320,0.97,3597.26,3604.5,"Instead, I was watching live streams until 4:00 in the morning.",20,,
321,0.97,3604.5,3619.215,"I am here to state that, again, if we as--I am here to state that we as Electeds are going to show up at the police barricades, we need to make sure that the sole mission is De-Escalating the tension.",20,,
322,0.97,3619.215,3627.557,"If SPD does believe it can wait until the middle of the night to use force, be reminded that the whole world is watching and that includes city council.",20,,
323,0.97,3627.557,3635.965,"While I'm not good with social media, I am smart enough to turn on multiple live streams to get multiple perspectives on a situation with multiple screens.",20,,
324,0.97,3635.965,3640.403,I don't need to be in the Eoc to be able to see what's going on our streets.,20,,
325,0.97,3640.403,3645.575,What I saw was a tense and peaceful encroachment of the police line.,20,,
326,0.97,3645.575,3647.977,There were still De-Escalation tactics available to SPD.,20,,
327,0.97,3647.977,3655.585,It is as simple as taking a knee to show that you are hearing the people that you are facing off with.,20,,
328,0.97,3655.585,3663.226,The words I have to express the reaction to what I witnessed are not appropriate for this meeting.,20,,
329,0.97,3663.226,3673.369,"The response I saw was nearly 2 1/2, possibly 3 hours of gas grenades sprayed and rubber bullets used against residents.",20,,
330,0.97,3673.369,3680.743,I watched as multiple individuals were struck directly by flash grenades.,20,,
331,0.97,3680.743,3683.112,To be dragged off to safety by others.,20,,
332,0.97,3683.112,3684.647,I understand the need for officers to feel safe.,20,,
333,0.97,3684.647,3687.583,I understand the need to reestablish a police line.,20,,
334,0.97,3687.583,3691.154,I do not understand the use of force in the face of peaceful behavior.,20,,
335,0.97,3691.154,3699.328,I do not understand how 2 1/2 hours of aggressive and violent behavior is proportionate to a peaceful encroachment of a police line.,20,,
336,0.97,3699.328,3718.081,"We will be relying heavily on our oversight bodies to understand exactly what occurred and it seems that we cannot wait for oversight--for review because military grade weapons continue to be used night after night in our city, after assurances are made that these weapons will not be used.",20,,
337,0.97,3718.081,3721.317,I won't support budget items that Militarize our police force to any degree.,20,,
338,0.97,3721.317,3729.992,"I will support the budget items that the community identifies as necessary to create a more whole, safe community.",20,,
339,0.97,3729.992,3738.434,What I will close with is again statement that I understand that I will never understand what it's like to be black in America.,20,,
340,0.97,3738.434,3759.489,"When I discussed Demilitarizing the police with people, people tell me, teach me and remind that they are not as worried about facing off with military grade weapons used against them, as they are worried about meeting a lone officer in the middle of the night or by themselves in broad daylight.",20,,
341,0.97,3759.489,3779.976,"This is why our accountability framework is so important, and it also brings into focus for me that we have two tracks of what to accomplish, insuring that every resident in our city is safe when interacting with the police and that we must Demilitarize our police force.",20,,
342,0.97,3779.976,3781.477,"Thank you, Council President.",20,,
343,0.97,3781.477,3787.984,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss for sharing those words.",21,,
344,0.97,3787.984,3801.063,"Any other colleagues, anyone else have any comments or questions for Councilmember Mosqueda and this report?",21,,
345,0.97,3801.063,3802.632,Councilmember Morales?,21,,
346,0.97,3802.632,3803.099,Am I on?,22,,
347,0.97,3803.099,3804.3,Okay.,22,,
348,0.97,3804.3,3806.836,"Yeah, you are.",23,,
349,0.97,3806.836,3807.103,Okay.,24,,
350,0.97,3807.103,3807.87,"Good morning, everybody.",24,,
351,0.97,3807.87,3828.424,"I want to thank Councilmember Mosqueda for laying out the conversation that we will be having beginning this week, and, you know, as we begin to discuss this need to Rebalance the budget for 2020, I think it's important for us to consider what guiding principles we will use.",24,,
352,0.97,3828.424,3836.032,"We certainly have a fiscal, a fiduciary responsibility to balance the budget and this is going to be a hard discussion that we begin this week.",24,,
353,0.97,3836.032,3855.017,But I want to be clear that I will be using a racial equity lens to ensure that communities of color are not account disproportionately impacted by the cuts.,24,,
354,0.97,3855.017,3858.02,Especially for right now is to begin who benefits.,24,,
355,0.97,3858.02,3861.557,Who will be better off as a result of the decisions that we make?,24,,
356,0.97,3861.557,3866.095,"Because especially when we are talking about budget cuts, somebody is going to benefit.",24,,
357,0.97,3866.095,3867.697,Otherwise the cuts wouldn't be necessary.,24,,
358,0.97,3867.697,3869.465,So we need to think about that.,24,,
359,0.97,3869.465,3880.076,We also need to think about who will be burdened and who is going to be harmed and is there going to be a way to reduce negative impacts.,24,,
360,0.97,3880.076,3890.987,"We want to make sure that the degree of harm is not, again, disproportionately left on communities of color.",24,,
361,0.97,3890.987,3906.569,"Who is missing, how the consequences of a particular group--or how a particular group will be impacted, who has been Unrepresented or left out in the decision making about what we have to discuss, and we need to know what the data says.",24,,
362,0.97,3906.569,3908.504,Are there gaps in our knowledge?,24,,
363,0.97,3908.504,3914.543,"Is the data that we are using to inform our cuts being tracked through existing programs, existing performance data?",24,,
364,0.97,3914.543,3923.219,Do we know how our communities of color have been served or not served by the programs and initiatives that we are looking at?,24,,
365,0.97,3923.219,3940.836,We have to make sure that there's not a disproportionate impact on the folks in our community who have been marginalized and who are most vulnerable and certainly need to make sure that communities of color aren't disproportionately impacted by this.,24,,
366,0.97,3940.836,3944.173,We do that by building black community wealth.,24,,
367,0.97,3944.173,3972.868,"So given our current budget it means that we have to transfer power, we have to shift the burden of who pays for city services and that's why I am excited that we will also be discussing the progressive revenue legislation that Councilmember Sawant and I have brought forward and we look forward to that--advancing that legislation to make sure that there is additional revenue coming in so we have an ability to lessen the impact somewhat at least for the next year or two.",24,,
368,0.97,3972.868,3983.679,I will have more comments about the police question in particular but I will wait until it's my turn in the rotation.,24,,
369,0.97,3983.679,3984.08,Thank you.,25,,
370,0.97,3984.08,3987.917,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,26,,
371,0.97,3987.917,3991.787,Any other questions or comments on Councilmember Mosqueda's report?,26,,
372,0.97,3991.787,3993.956,"Yes, Council President, this is Councilmember Juarez.",27,,
373,0.97,3993.956,3996.692,"May you have a few moments, please?",27,,
374,0.97,3996.692,3997.526,Absolutely.,28,,
375,0.97,3997.526,3999.228,The floor is yours.,28,,
376,0.97,3999.228,4001.697,Thankyou.,29,,
377,0.97,4001.697,4002.798,I apologize for being late.,29,,
378,0.97,4002.798,4022.418,"Let me start with, I agree with you, Councilmember Gonzalez and the work you had done on the reform and the energy it's going to take to balance the change in political needs and the need for police.",29,,
379,0.97,4022.418,4037.299,I do agree with Councilmember Mosqueda shared where I think there's the discussion that has to happen in the spectrum of--there is a spectrum of what they call Defunding.,29,,
380,0.97,4037.299,4046.275,"When Councilmember Mosqueda talks about Defunding the police at 50%, I can't agree with that until I know exactly what I'm talking about, what is 50%.",29,,
381,0.97,4046.275,4063.092,"So for me, as some of you are familiar with the theory of the Overton window theory, it's a political situation that maybe ten years ago was unthinkable, but now it's more than possible and we have seen that with a lot of public policy issues.",29,,
382,0.97,4063.092,4068.497,Ten years ago nobody would have thought of disbanding or Defunding police.,29,,
383,0.97,4068.497,4081.277,"And I think we should make clear that the Minneapolis city council intends to disband the city police force entirely, which I don't think that's what Councilmember Mosqueda was saying.",29,,
384,0.97,4081.277,4082.711,She is talking about Defunding.,29,,
385,0.97,4082.711,4090.352,"But for me the argument and the discussion and the debate and which I hope everybody has heard, is that it's a spectrum.",29,,
386,0.97,4090.352,4102.598,"You go from where we are at right now, which is full funding, to the complete other side of the spectrum, which is no funding, disbanding and I don't think that's what we are saying here.",29,,
387,0.97,4102.598,4108.504,I do agree and evidence does show that less policing shows less violence.,29,,
388,0.97,4108.504,4120.716,"And it's clear, and I have always stated this and been a proponent of this, that I believe in the politics of protest.",29,,
389,0.97,4120.716,4124.787,I don't believe political protests automatically equal threats to the public.,29,,
390,0.97,4124.787,4127.656,And that's another area where we have to have a discussion.,29,,
391,0.97,4127.656,4139.835,"I do agree that we need a, if you will, the receipts from the Seattle police Department on the things they spend to hurt people.",29,,
392,0.97,4139.835,4143.539,"Flash bangs, rubber bullets, tear gas, Militarized equipment.",29,,
393,0.97,4143.539,4149.178,I believe that we can take that picture and pull those things out.,29,,
394,0.97,4149.178,4160.489,I think what troubles me most is that we can't allow this chaos or allow this chaos to turn us into turning on each other and not listening.,29,,
395,0.97,4160.489,4173.235,"Over the weekend I got over a dozen calls from small businesses on Capitol Hill who are heart broken, heart broken, many of them businesses, that their businesses were destroyed.",29,,
396,0.97,4173.235,4180.543,And I think that is part of the question and part of the equation and part of the spectrum.,29,,
397,0.97,4180.543,4195.157,"When I hear people say there's a few bad apples and as Councilmember Gonzalez talked about her career, you know, I had been a lawyer for well over 30 years, as a public defender, legal services, I was a King County Superior Court Judge.",29,,
398,0.97,4195.157,4196.692,I put people in prison.,29,,
399,0.97,4196.692,4199.728,I also went from a governor's office to Wall Street.,29,,
400,0.97,4199.728,4205.467,"I have some lived experience and I have some professional experience and as I tell people, I am not really that smart.",29,,
401,0.97,4205.467,4208.003,I just have lived longer.,29,,
402,0.97,4208.003,4217.78,"And what I'm seeing now, and I hope what we see in this Council for once is the real goal and leadership to move together.",29,,
403,0.97,4217.78,4224.32,"When I hear people say there's a few bad apples on the police force, I adamantly disagree with that.",29,,
404,0.97,4224.32,4226.355,It's just not a healthy tree.,29,,
405,0.97,4226.355,4229.391,We need to plant a new tree.,29,,
406,0.97,4229.391,4236.565,"And as the President Gonzalez said, we have to completely Reimagine, Reenvision what community policing is.",29,,
407,0.97,4236.565,4257.753,I do agree with the principle on Defunding that we have to take out some of that money and put it in places for our black and Brown Brothers and sisters.,29,,
408,0.97,4257.753,4260.723,And I had been watching that my whole life.,29,,
409,0.97,4260.723,4266.595,I had been reading this book called the end of policing.,29,,
410,0.97,4266.595,4271.767,And it's very provocative about what happens when you--are we talking about taking away the police?,29,,
411,0.97,4271.767,4273.369,You flip the switch and all of a sudden there are no police.,29,,
412,0.97,4273.369,4275.204,What do you do when there's a murder?,29,,
413,0.97,4275.204,4276.972,What do you do you when there's a crime?,29,,
414,0.97,4276.972,4278.24,There's really good responses to that.,29,,
415,0.97,4278.24,4280.442,That's not what people are saying.,29,,
416,0.97,4280.442,4291.086,They are saying that you can't use violence as a primary tool to control people who have a first amendment right to tell the world that they are being violated.,29,,
417,0.97,4291.086,4293.989,And we know riots are the voice of the unheard.,29,,
418,0.97,4293.989,4302.631,"So I don't want to jump into, let's recall the Mayor, let's get rid of the police Department.",29,,
419,0.97,4302.631,4306.301,I am not about that and you all kind of know that about me.,29,,
420,0.97,4306.301,4322.718,"So I am hoping, listening to President Gonzalez and her leadership, that we actually have fundamental and honest and respectful conversations about how we go from looking at the police Department, full funding to what we Defund and where that money goes.",29,,
421,0.97,4322.718,4330.459,"And we don't fall into this trap of finger pointing or if you're not with me, you're against me.",29,,
422,0.97,4330.459,4340.502,I am tired of being called an establishment Democrat because sometimes I want to insert a little common sense.,29,,
423,0.97,4340.502,4344.006,I was at one of the protests.,29,,
424,0.97,4344.006,4349.478,Councilmember Pedersen and I were at the University village one and the Lake City one.,29,,
425,0.97,4349.478,4364.426,"And I should also add that because a long time ago when we thought that the North end needed a police station, that Councilmember Gonzalez and I weren't the Masterminds behind $160 million police station.",29,,
426,0.97,4364.426,4364.827,We just weren't.,29,,
427,0.97,4364.827,4368.363,There were 12 votes that said yes before we got there and then people said no.,29,,
428,0.97,4368.363,4370.899,And we learned a lot from that.,29,,
429,0.97,4370.899,4377.372,Councilmember Gonzalez and I sat down with the black lives matter folks back then and we talked to them.,29,,
430,0.97,4377.372,4386.849,"And I commend this Mayor for talking directly to black lives matter, the community police Commissioner, the IG, OPA and Nikkita Oliver.",29,,
431,0.97,4386.849,4394.523,I may not agree with everything she says but I respect her right to say it and a lot of it is the truth.,29,,
432,0.97,4394.523,4398.627,"In order for us to be real leaders, we can't be Reactive.",29,,
433,0.97,4398.627,4409.872,"Yes, we can carry our personal experiences and since I'm older than all of you, I get to say this, I am think I'm almost elder status right now, I have been through a lot more racism and violence than you.",29,,
434,0.97,4409.872,4410.773,I just have.,29,,
435,0.97,4410.773,4411.206,So has my family.,29,,
436,0.97,4411.206,4419.715,"The other side that breaks my heart is I have two nephews, one on the reservation and one in Bakersfield, California.",29,,
437,0.97,4419.715,4421.85,Both of them are police officers and I hear what they say.,29,,
438,0.97,4421.85,4434.663,So I try to come at this from not only a human perspective and lived experience but looking to the leadership and the subject matter expertise of people like President Gonzalez who has been through this stuff.,29,,
439,0.97,4434.663,4437.833,And when we did the accountability legislation.,29,,
440,0.97,4437.833,4440.469,A lot of people were angry about the contract.,29,,
441,0.97,4440.469,4449.411,But I know the people that were on the labor relations board did a really good job and the best job they felt we could do to move forward.,29,,
442,0.97,4449.411,4454.917,Are we always going to get it right and perfect every Fricking time?,29,,
443,0.97,4454.917,4455.083,No.,29,,
444,0.97,4455.083,4455.884,You know why?,29,,
445,0.97,4455.884,4457.052,Because we are human.,29,,
446,0.97,4457.052,4459.021,You know why systems are screwed up?,29,,
447,0.97,4459.021,4461.423,Because we are not perfect.,29,,
448,0.97,4461.423,4463.258,Humans make those systems.,29,,
449,0.97,4463.258,4463.759,We have shortcomings.,29,,
450,0.97,4463.759,4489.251,"What I hope to see from this Council and I hope what we instill in our great city is we give everyone an opportunity to have some room to speak, to have some grace, to have some humanity, to understand and hear the cries of the people that need to be protected and not just be Reactive in an anger force because that doesn't make us any better than the people that we are pointing our fingers at.",29,,
451,0.97,4489.251,4504.9,"So with that, I look forward to working with this Council and president Gonzalez and her experience and moving not only this conversation forward, but real legislation that changes our city and changes us.",29,,
452,0.97,4504.9,4510.906,"Thank you, Councilmember chairman--I'm sorry, president Gonzalez.",29,,
453,0.97,4510.906,4516.278,"Thank you, Councilmember Juarez for those words.",30,,
454,0.97,4516.278,4580.809,"Really appreciate you sharing your perspective with us and, again, I think your point around not, you know, needing to tear each other down in order to effectuate the change that we need to effectuate is a point well made, and, you know, I have--I will make a personal commitment that--to stay focused on the issues and the demands of community that are being made by black led organizations and the people who are most negatively impacted by policing and violence at the hands of the police and I make that commitment to you and to all of my colleagues to, you know, engage in this conversation in a way that is going to stay focused on the substantive issues, and that I believe can be done without tearing each other down in the process.",30,,
455,0.97,4580.809,4587.849,"So, colleagues, any other comments or questions?",30,,
456,0.97,4587.849,4588.35,Councilmember Mosqueda?,30,,
457,0.97,4588.35,4608.971,I wanted to say thank you to Councilmember Juarez for her words and I want to again reiterate the importance of us having the list of the recommendations of black led and people of color led organizations who have been asking for substantial changes in the way we invest and redirect funding.,31,,
458,0.97,4608.971,4638.867,"Investments being redirected upstream instead of downstream and towards please tactics, how do we invest in our communities upstream including housing and Self-Discrimination strategies, opportunities, all of those things are really critical and I really appreciate Councilmember Juarez calling out where additional investments should go and we have lists and examples from communicates here as well as I think other cities, New York and Los Angeles have some really great examples of how they are redirecting funding as well.",31,,
459,0.97,4638.867,4653.281,"But this will be a process that will be really about reinvesting in our communities, not just Deinvesting and really Re-Prioritizing where we put those dollars.",31,,
460,0.97,4653.281,4683.512,"As we think about this being the first Monday before--I'm sorry, the first Monday after the city has begun to reopen some of its small businesses, we have heard from a number of businesses who are very concerned about what is happening and the fact that they couldn't open their doors or they have had patrons who have been experiencing gas and other forms of arrests in front of their establishments and I think there is common ground there with some of our small businesses who have been reaching out to say we have to find another strategy.",31,,
461,0.97,4683.512,4694.289,So I thank you for raising up the question about small businesses as well because I think there's another voice that's calling on us for Transformational change from that perspective and I did not mention that before.,31,,
462,0.97,4694.289,4700.796,So I just want to say thank you to all the small businesses who have reached out and asked for a different strategy as well.,31,,
463,0.97,4700.796,4712.541,"We will also be including those voices, especially as we think about women and Minority-Owned businesses and how important it is for them to get up and running as well.",31,,
464,0.97,4715.043,4716.912,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",32,,
465,0.97,4716.912,4722.651,Any other questions or comments for Councilmember Mosqueda?,32,,
466,0.97,4722.651,4729.624,Hearing and seeing none we are going to go through the role call.,32,,
467,0.97,4729.624,4734.696,So next up is Councilmember Pedersen.,32,,
468,0.97,4734.696,4735.163,"Hello, colleagues.",33,,
469,0.97,4735.163,4741.903,I want to support the comments of Councilmember Gonzalez and Herbold regarding police accountability.,33,,
470,0.97,4741.903,4752.114,And I look forward to the deep dive on the budget led by budget chair Mosqueda with the attention to details articulated by Councilmember Juarez.,33,,
471,0.97,4752.114,4770.198,"While I participated in some of the many police accountability demonstrations in my district, I was not able to attend the ones in Capitol Hill, but I watched and was sickened by the disturbing Video feeds, unacceptable responses by many police officers in that precinct.",33,,
472,0.97,4770.198,4776.438,It's obviously wrong for a government to use violent tactics against their people.,33,,
473,0.97,4776.438,4789.05,"The actions that prompted these protests this past week, the murder by police in Minneapolis of George Floyd and the long history of racism and other injustices against black and Brown lives.",33,,
474,0.97,4789.05,4800.228,People are Fed up and they have a right to protest this injustice without suffering further brutality from those who have pledged to serve and protect them.,33,,
475,0.97,4800.228,4807.702,Over this historic week trust has eroded between many of my constituents and a police Department funded to protect them.,33,,
476,0.97,4807.702,4814.209,I believe most of our police officers are good people but they are working within a tainted institution.,33,,
477,0.97,4814.209,4817.612,We need to boldly rethink and change things.,33,,
478,0.97,4817.612,4834.796,"As we confront a budget deficit of over $300 million, I want to signal to my colleagues that I am open to Reallocating substantial dollars to we clearly and boldly Demilitarize and fully fix our police Department.",33,,
479,0.97,4834.796,4841.67,The funds from Military-Style weapons were approved by previous city councils and this city Council has the authority to Defund them.,33,,
480,0.97,4841.67,4852.214,I have a strong track record of funding upstream solutions including high quality preschool and tens of thousands of units of low income housing.,33,,
481,0.97,4852.214,4873.134,"After consulting with and hearing from hundreds of my constituents over the weekend and conferring with the King County Councilmember whose district overlaps district four, who carefully Crafted a pledge from community input, I have signed this pledge and joining my Council colleagues to sign the letter which has a similar pledge.",33,,
482,0.97,4873.134,4878.106,"Demilitarize our police Department, restrict the use of excessive force.",33,,
483,0.97,4878.106,4883.612,Increase accountability and transparency in police Union contracts.,33,,
484,0.97,4883.612,4886.848,Official power to our independent oversight boards.,33,,
485,0.97,4886.848,4890.151,Redistrict police funding to effective Community-Based alternatives.,33,,
486,0.97,4890.151,4900.629,"With the use of tear gas on protesters in Capitol Hill over the weekend, despite the Mayor's earlier directive not to use tear gas, I also believe legislative fixes are warranted as soon as possible.",33,,
487,0.97,4900.629,4907.802,I look forward to working with my Council colleagues to take stronger action this week.,33,,
488,0.97,4907.802,4913.341,I support Councilmember Herbold's legislation to reform how mourning badges are used by officers.,33,,
489,0.97,4913.341,4935.964,I also support the legislation proposed by Councilmember Sawant to eliminate Chokeholds and chemical agents against the people of Seattle . So I know it's traditional for Councilmembers at the morning briefing to report on legislative items we are sponsoring or coming out of our committees so I will transition to that now.,33,,
490,0.97,4935.964,4943.571,There are no items from the transportation and utilities Committee on today's agenda.,33,,
491,0.97,4943.571,4951.947,Not from my committee but Impacting my district today's the Council will consider adopting Council bill 119179.,33,,
492,0.97,4951.947,4955.383,Which Reauthorizes the business improvement area for the growing University district.,33,,
493,0.97,4955.383,4970.165,There is a substitute bill circulated by our city council central staff with Yolanda H0 with technical corrections and a noncontroversial change to clarify the composition of the Bia board.,33,,
494,0.97,4970.165,5001.963,"Regarding the more challenging amendments to reduce the term of the Bia and to speed up the competitive process, I simplified that and consolidated that into a single amendment to make it easier today at full Council, the purpose of that amendment is to make sure we enhance our goal of giving small neighborhood businesses a greater voice and making sure we quickly have a competitive process for awarding what's essentially a $1 million contract to the program manager that administrators the Bia.",33,,
495,0.97,5001.963,5008.87,I want to thank Councilmember Morales for leading this through her Committee and economic development committee meetings in a public hearing.,33,,
496,0.97,5008.87,5014.242,People can Email their comments still to U district Bia at Seattle.Gov.,33,,
497,0.97,5014.242,5023.251,Please contact me or central staff with any questions about Reauthorizing the Bia in district four.,33,,
498,0.97,5023.251,5023.918,Thank you.,33,,
499,0.97,5023.918,5028.823,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen, for those remarks.",34,,
500,0.97,5028.823,5049.544,"Colleagues, I want to just let you know that I am experiencing some Internet issues in my home, so if there's an awkward delay from me in the transition, I want to make sure that you're aware of that and if I get kicked off of the line, I'll--I promise you I will be back.",34,,
501,0.97,5049.544,5067.128,So I think I'm going to send the role call list to--in the event I continue to have technology issues on my end but want to let you know that I'm having some issues with my Internet this morning.,34,,
502,0.97,5067.128,5067.328,Okay.,34,,
503,0.97,5067.328,5073.802,Let's--any questions or comments for Councilmember Pedersen on his report?,34,,
504,0.97,5073.802,5079.474,Hearing and seeing none we are going to move over to Councilmember Sawant.,34,,
505,0.97,5079.474,5098.693,"Before I do that, I do want to note that we have Yolanda H0 from Council central staff on the meeting today at the request of Councilmember Pedersen in order to present his amendment to Council bill 109779 related to the U district Bia.",34,,
506,0.97,5098.693,5125.987,"I do want to provide Yolanda a quick opportunity to address those amendments and to be able to each of you colleagues in terms of any questions or concerns that you might have about those amendments, and Councilmember Morales, please feel free to Chime in as it relates to the amendments being proposed by Councilmember Pedersen.",34,,
507,0.97,5125.987,5143.037,"So if it's all right with you, colleagues, let's go ahead and--we have asked Yolanda to be on the call today so I feel like it's important to make sure that she has an opportunity to walk us through these amendments, so, Yolanda I'm going to hand it over to you, have you walk us through the amendments.",34,,
508,0.97,5143.037,5156.885,We will open it up to questions and comments from Councilmember Morales and close out this report.,34,,
509,0.97,5173.234,5186.848,I would note that we have included some additional findings regarding the Covid-19 emergency recommended by the law Department.,34,,
510,0.97,5186.848,5190.285,We clarified some terminology used to calculate the assessments.,34,,
511,0.97,5190.285,5204.699,And we change the responsibility for contracting with the program manager from the Department of finance and administrative services to the office of economic development as per hour adopted policies regarding Eias.,34,,
512,0.97,5204.699,5223.818,"And also consolidated the--by business tenants so that there are a total of three seats, to which our business tenants subject to triple net lease.",34,,
513,0.97,5223.818,5232.927,"This amendment one would also limit the number of seats held by University of Washington on the Bia advisory board to 35% of the board for a maximum of five seats, whichever is lower.",34,,
514,0.97,5232.927,5257.752,"I would note that the University of Washington currently holds five seats on the Bia current advisory board and as drafted without this amendment, the legislation would allow the Uw to hold seven seats if it was limited to the current cat that is in the legislation.",34,,
515,0.97,5257.752,5258.519,That is amendment one.,34,,
516,0.97,5258.519,5266.06,"Amendment two, the term and program manager changes would reduce the duration of the District Bia from proposed 12 years to 10 years.",34,,
517,0.97,5266.06,5279.607,It would also limit the contract term of the initial program manager which is currently the District partnership to one year before the office of economic development would be required to conduct a request for qualification process.,34,,
518,0.97,5279.607,5282.677,"For the Bia program manager, which would then have a Five- year contract.",34,,
519,0.97,5282.677,5296.557,"For the end of this contract, the office of economic development then conducts a request for proposal process to select the Bia's program manager for the remaining 4 years of the Bia.",34,,
520,0.97,5296.557,5300.862,The intent is that the Rfq--there is an Rfq process and Rfp process.,34,,
521,0.97,5300.862,5323.618,The Rfq process is intended to be simpler and less administratively burdensome for the office of economic development acknowledging the shortened term of the interim program manager . As drafted the program manager would have 5 years before meeting two run the Rfp process.,34,,
522,0.97,5323.618,5337.332,"If the Bia is Reauthorized, the organization serving as program manager at that time would be allowed to serve as the interim programming manager for one year.",34,,
523,0.97,5337.332,5341.402,The intended effect is to essentially create two Five- year terms for the program manager.,34,,
524,0.97,5341.402,5346.007,I'm happy to answer any questions.,34,,
525,0.97,5346.007,5347.709,Okay.,35,,
526,0.97,5347.709,5360.421,"Colleagues, any questions for Yolanda?",35,,
527,0.97,5364.425,5366.16,"Councilmember Moore Alice, anything you would like to add?",35,,
528,0.97,5366.16,5366.561,Yes.,36,,
529,0.97,5366.561,5389.751,"I would say from my conversations with folks and looking through the amendments and having conversations with the proponents and folks who are concerned about how this works, I think the first amendment is as Yolanda set a technical correction, shifting the Rfp process to the office of economic development.",36,,
530,0.97,5389.751,5398.893,"In addition, the Uw limitation on the ability to--the seats on the Bia.",36,,
531,0.97,5398.893,5400.895,That is fairly straightforward.,36,,
532,0.97,5400.895,5411.672,And the Uw has consulted with Councilmember Peterson . But I think there is full support for that.,36,,
533,0.97,5411.672,5420.414,I think the amendment is a little more--it has more contention to it.,36,,
534,0.97,5420.414,5427.922,So I'm happy to talk about that during the conversation this afternoon.,36,,
535,0.97,5427.922,5434.629,But I have some concerns about shortening the program so much.,36,,
536,0.97,5434.629,5448.509,When there is already a process in place for any other organization who might be interested in participating and apply to become a program manager.,36,,
537,0.97,5448.509,5450.244,There is nothing preventing that from happening right now.,36,,
538,0.97,5450.244,5461.656,So I think that there is a potential for creating some disruption when there is not a need for the process at this time.,36,,
539,0.97,5461.656,5470.565,And the five yearly time would give another organization time to sort of ramp up capacity and applied to provide that service when they are prepared.,36,,
540,0.97,5470.565,5485.58,"Some happy to answer any other questions . I'm sure Councilmember Pederson is prepared to answer some questions too and we can do that now or we can do it later in full counsel, whatever the Council President prefers.",36,,
541,0.97,5485.58,5505.766,"If there are some ongoing questions about those amendments, my preference would be those addressed here because we have Yolanda here and she can be available to Council members to answer any questions or provide clarification.",37,,
542,0.97,5505.766,5510.204,She will not be available to us at 2:00 this afternoon.,37,,
543,0.97,5510.204,5531.726,"So again, if there are questions about the amendments in the underlying bill that we need Yolanda assistance in navigating through, now is the time to post those questions and make those inquiries.",37,,
544,0.97,5531.726,5535.396,Obviously at 2:00 we will engage in debate and that is much more about persuasion than anything else.,37,,
545,0.97,5535.396,5541.636,And you know we can Reserve persuasion for 2:00 in terms of the actual amendments.,37,,
546,0.97,5541.636,5561.055,But if there is--are there any other questions around the underlying bill or the amendments as proposed by Councilmember Pederson?,37,,
547,0.97,5563.691,5564.158,Councilmember Mosqueda?,37,,
548,0.97,5564.158,5566.26,I want to say thank you for your opening comments.,38,,
549,0.97,5566.26,5567.328,That was helpful to hear.,38,,
550,0.97,5567.328,5573.034,But the process you have been engaged in and the process you hope to see over the next few weeks on the budget and police budget specifically.,38,,
551,0.97,5573.034,5573.968,Thank you for those comments.,38,,
552,0.97,5573.968,5580.274,"I did want to ask Councilmember Moore Alice, to explain a little bit more, some of the questions you for see.",38,,
553,0.97,5580.274,5585.346,"I want to defer to you to see if they are the same thing and if not, maybe we can ask questions about the amendment.",38,,
554,0.97,5585.346,5589.05,"Yes, please.",39,,
555,0.97,5589.05,5594.088,Questions around the process itself.,40,,
556,0.97,5594.088,5600.995,The advisory board typically manages the contracting process.,40,,
557,0.97,5600.995,5607.301,"And if they are dissatisfied, what is the process now?",40,,

559,0.97,5635.529,5643.604,So there is nothing precluding an organization from doing that right now.,40,,
560,0.97,5643.604,5646.707,"Which for me, it RAISES the question too about why we need a new process.",40,,
561,0.97,5646.707,5672.333,"So there was questions about setting a precedent for the office of economic development to manage the Rfp process and what it would mean for the capacity of Oed is there are other nine bias we have in the city, also want to move toward this Rfp process and whether there is capacity for Oed to do that.",40,,
562,0.97,5672.333,5690.151,My understanding is that they are accepting the legislation as transmitted . but would still be looking to make sure that the actual decision-making about who might win a bid to be the program manager would fall back to the Advisory board itself.,40,,

633,0.97,6171.765,6179.239,Mayor Durkan's announcement that there would be a 30 day So- called ban in the use of Teargas shows the pressure of the movement.,45,,
634,0.97,6179.239,6189.249,However she has demonstrated night after night that her press conference pledges were empty PR gestures that bore no relationship to the reality on the street.,45,,

636,0.97,6193.487,6203.463,And it is inaccurate for the media and others to characterize the Mayor's action as a ban or even a pause.,45,,
637,0.97,6203.463,6204.264,It is actually not.,45,,

640,0.97,6208.969,6235.662,"Specifically it notes that members continue to have the authority to have chemical weapons to include the use of cs gas, continuing this idea that we don't accept that somehow with appropriate training it is okay for the police to inflict this violence.",45,,

644,0.97,6247.341,6254.247,It is a chemical composition of something else and is okay and not a breaking of the promise for 30 day pause.,45,,
645,0.97,6254.247,6268.095,"Myself and hundreds experience last night was a guest that operated exactly like Teargas in its effect on our eyes, ability to breathe, the burning sensation in our mouth and throat and the impact on the lens.",45,,

650,0.97,6298.959,6312.706,"If Seattle police instead show up with even more lethal weaponry, then of course we have to ban that as well but that is not an excuse to not ban chemical where tens and rubber bullets and other So- called crowd control devices.",45,,
651,0.97,6312.706,6320.213,If the Seattle city council passes this legislation it will be historic and it will be an inspiration for what movements around the country can win.,45,,

653,0.97,6327.054,6332.225,I hope other Councilmembers will join me in this and pass it at the meeting next week without ordering it on.,45,,
654,0.97,6332.225,6353.046,"The second bill, I'm walking on to the introduction of the calendar today, for a vote next week is a bill to ban the use of choke holds by the Seattle police Department.",45,,
655,0.97,6353.046,6361.655,This is largely Self- explanatory and I will not go into detail here but from Eric garner to manual Ellis to George Floyd we have all seen the devastating consequences of choke holds.,45,,
656,0.97,6361.655,6364.391,"Similar restrictions have been put in place by other cities, most recently Minneapolis.",45,,
657,0.97,6364.391,6367.16,"Absolutely, we need to keep in mind a sobering word of caution.",45,,
658,0.97,6367.16,6387.748,"Banning these weapons, banning choke holds will not be enough legally to grow our movement, escalate our peaceful movement, peaceful civil disobedience because passing laws, as hard as they will be require pressure from the movement and will not be enough.",45,,
659,0.97,6387.748,6390.35,Show colds were banned in New York City when Eric garner was killed.,45,,
660,0.97,6390.35,6396.39,"And Obviously, that law was insufficient, to save his life.",45,,
661,0.97,6396.39,6398.692,Legislation like this is critical if we win these two bills.,45,,
662,0.97,6398.692,6408.602,"As I said it will be because of the power of the movement, overcoming the opposition of the entrenched establishment.",45,,
663,0.97,6408.602,6411.471,But we need the legislation to be paired with more structural changes in society.,45,,
664,0.97,6411.471,6421.615,"We need real police accountability measures like elected community oversight with the real powers of the police including hiring, firing and subpoena powers.",45,,
665,0.97,6421.615,6426.486,We need strong measures to reduce poverty and inequality.,45,,

680,0.97,6514.207,6523.216,To the fund police and cut the Seattle police Department's budget by 50% to instead fund grassroots programs for restorative justice and other socially necessary programs.,45,,
681,0.97,6523.216,6523.617,Like housing.,45,,
682,0.97,6523.617,6535.495,"This can be done among other needs by ending the purchase of the so-called crowd control weapons, as we discussed and ending the police violence against demonstrations.",45,,
683,0.97,6535.495,6543.904,I'm really happy to hear Councilmember--Councilmember Mosqueda has joined the community and me that we need to cut the budget I have half and I welcome that.,45,,
684,0.97,6543.904,6555.248,"Additionally, the idea for the budget that is cutting the funds of the city departments, that do support our communities, is totally unacceptable.",45,,
685,0.97,6555.248,6570.664,"The Covid-19 crisis is creating an economic crisis and has resulted in a recession that is almost as bad and probably will get worse than the great depression, leaving millions unemployed in the state, tens of millions throughout the nation.",45,,
686,0.97,6570.664,6580.24,"And tens of thousands probably, over 100,000 now in Seattle with either lost jobs or reduced hours.",45,,
687,0.97,6580.24,6584.578,We cannot have politicians saying that black lives matter and then turn around and represent big business and the wealthy.,45,,
688,0.97,6584.578,6599.793,"And oppose the Amazon tax or some other measure for substantial, substantial hundreds of millions of dollars of taxes on the largest corporations so that we can fund our needs.",45,,
689,0.97,6599.793,6620.88,"The Amazon tax, has come forward by as a member more Allison Meehan behalf of the moment is a modest tax on big business to expand publicly owned, Rent-Controlled, social housing so we can begin to strike a blow against racist Gentrification against Working- class communities of color and create decent jobs with priority hiring and programs.",45,,
690,0.97,6620.88,6636.129,"Throughout history, the greater the inequality in a society the more Militarized its policing needs to be from the ruling class to perpetuate and defend those inequities.",45,,
691,0.97,6636.129,6656.316,"Social logically speaking, we can predict that in the coming years Seattle and the nation and globally, we will either make massive public investments in jobs, social housing and other policies, regular Working- class people need or we will see more and more violent policing.",45,,
692,0.97,6656.316,6657.884,That is the logic of the capitalist system.,45,,
693,0.97,6657.884,6670.63,"I want to remind members of the public that my Socialist office along the people budget movement has for years, for years propose cutting the police budget to fund housing, tiny House villages and stopping--.",45,,

707,0.97,6766.793,6775.468,"Jenny Durkin has failed the people, the working people of Seattle since day one of the administration.",45,,
708,0.97,6775.468,6788.047,"The brutal murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police has led a spark of national and global protest by youth and working people, Fed up with racist, violent and deeply unequal society under capitalism.",45,,
709,0.97,6788.047,6801.895,"In Seattle thousands upon thousands of ordinary people have come out, courageously in the daily protest to demand justice for police killing and systemic change.",45,,
710,0.97,6801.895,6809.969,It has been tragically ironic this growing movement against police violence and brutality has been consistently met with more violence and brutality.,45,,
711,0.97,6809.969,6824.851,The responsibility for this vicious targeting of these overwhelmingly peaceful protests in Seattle lies with Mayor Jenny Durkan.,45,,
712,0.97,6825.885,6828.321,Durkin and the city's Democratic party establishment have utterly failed ordinary people.,45,,
713,0.97,6828.321,6847.907,"Since the first protest on Saturday, may 30, Durkin has repeatedly unleashed Seattle police to use ever escalating violence against ordinary people, protesting the police murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and so many other black and Brown people.",45,,
714,0.97,6848.808,6856.916,"Under Durkin's direction, the police have inflicted Teargas, Mace, rubber bullets, flash bang grenades, curfews, arrests and other oppressive tactics on Seattle activists and residents, including children in attempt to bully and silence the protest movement.",45,,
715,0.97,6856.916,6871.764,"The police, under Durkin's leadership have deployed Militaristic test six in full right care to spread fear among ordinary people.",45,,
716,0.97,6871.764,6874.467,Video reveals the police come prepared with instructions and equipment to Orchestrate violence.,45,,
717,0.97,6874.467,6885.345,"That is why, as a Socialist elected representative accountable to the working people it is my duty to join with the rapidly growing cause of the community for Jenny Durkin to step down.",45,,
718,0.97,6885.345,6888.982,"Even before the events of this past week, Durkin was failing the people of Seattle.",45,,
719,0.97,6888.982,6907.9,"She aligned with the Trump administration and the police in seeking to get the police Department out from under the Federal oversight of the consent degree, even as brutality toward and killings of black and Brown people, poor and homeless neighbors and those facing mental illness continue unabated.",45,,
720,0.97,6907.9,6921.08,Administration has ignored repeated community efforts to call for a sweep--humane and ineffective homeless Sweeps of Encampments and has double down on the Sweeps' policy.,45,,
721,0.97,6921.08,6922.982,The Sweeps have continued during the pandemic.,45,,
722,0.97,6922.982,6925.318,Despite crisis outrage that the community.,45,,
723,0.97,6925.318,6948.908,"Since being elected with the help of political donations by Amazon, Durkin has doggedly fought to maintain the tax even the Amazon and other big businesses enjoy and fought against progressive taxation.",45,,
724,0.97,6953.212,6956.416,Tens of thousands of Seattle residents have lost jobs and income in the last two months.,45,,
725,0.97,6956.416,6963.756,"Countless are on the verge of homelessness and are struggling to get food and basic necessities, and yet even now, Durkin insists on protecting Amazon and other pandemic Profiteers from taxation to fund urgent human needs.",45,,
726,0.97,6963.756,6973.466,"Worse, she has poised to unveil a new budget that would Brutally/Hundreds of millions of dollars in funds for already underfunded social programs, further risking the health and safety of working people.",45,,
727,0.97,6973.466,6986.079,"On April 23, as working people have already begun to--from that recession Durkin flatly rejected the Amazon tax, saying, Yeah, that is never going to happen.",45,,
728,0.97,6986.079,6988.848,I think it is irresponsible for anyone to say that is even possible.,45,,
729,0.97,6988.848,6989.549,That is a quote.,45,,
730,0.97,6989.549,7000.46,Socialist alternative and I have no illusions that putting a liberal politician in the Mayor's office is going to solve the problems.,45,,
731,0.97,7000.46,7008.601,And working people and communities of color face in this deeply unequal city.,45,,
732,0.97,7008.601,7015.408,"Notwithstanding that, there are Úmany honest and Progressive rank and file activists in local Democratic party organizations who do important work in the movement and on whom we are proud to work aside.",45,,
733,0.97,7015.408,7028.488,The initial call for the resignation has been in fact led by many of the grassroots Democratic party activists.,45,,
734,0.97,7028.488,7033.393,"I urge alongside myself and Councilmember--Councilmember Mosqueda, the Democratic party city council members join us in calling for Mayor Durkan to resign.",45,,
735,0.97,7033.393,7054.447,Our movement was recognizing the Long-Standing truth that fundamentally the Democratic party at the national level is bought and paid for by Wall Street and serves corporate interests and our movement needs to build independent political power and a new party for working people that takes no money and is accountable to movements.,45,,
736,0.97,7054.447,7056.816,Mayor Durkan has failed the people from Seattle from day one.,45,,
737,0.97,7056.816,7068.861,She has abused her power and harm thousands of ordinary people on the streets call--pieces amended Nepali.,45,,
738,0.97,7068.861,7070.363,"This past week, has been the final straw.",45,,
739,0.97,7070.363,7080.94,It is time for Jenny Durkin to finally be held accountable . It is time for you to go.,45,,
740,0.97,7080.94,7086.012,"If Mayor Durkan refuses to step aside, it will be the responsibility of the city Council to remove her by introducing articles of impeachment.",45,,
741,0.97,7086.012,7086.312,Thank you.,45,,
742,0.97,7086.312,7093.853,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant for the remarks.",46,,
743,0.97,7093.853,7099.792,"Collins, any questions or comments on that report?",46,,
744,0.97,7099.792,7100.426,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",46,,
745,0.97,7100.426,7100.893,Thank you.,47,,
746,0.97,7100.893,7111.504,I just want to make a quick comment as it relates to specifically to the legislation she's working on today.,47,,
747,0.97,7111.504,7116.075,Related specifically to the use of chemical agents.,47,,
748,0.97,7116.075,7129.555,"Myself and president Gonzales just received a letter from the CPC with a number of issues that they are raising, probably about 13 different issues.",47,,
749,0.97,7129.555,7149.208,"Not directly related to the particular bill but there is the first item that they reference, it is related to their role as a consulting party to the Council.",47,,
750,0.97,7149.208,7167.226,"And to the Mayor as it relates specifically to the enactment or the proposal of policy issues, as recognized under the consent decree and the 2017 accountability ordinance.",47,,
751,0.97,7167.226,7171.764,Some going to read directly from this one very small section.,47,,
752,0.97,7171.764,7187.58,"We learned yesterday that chief best issued a memorandum on May 31, 2020 authorizing control officers to use cs gas canisters and 40 millimeter launchers during the ongoing protests.",47,,
753,0.97,7187.58,7193.819,We are dismayed that SPD did not alert the CPC of these changes.,47,,
754,0.97,7193.819,7198.291,And that they were not mentioned by chief best or Mayor Durkan.,47,,
755,0.97,7198.291,7201.994,When they attended last week's CDC meeting.,47,,
756,0.97,7201.994,7208.701,We were left wondering what other policy changes are occurring without our knowledge or the community's knowledge.,47,,
757,0.97,7208.701,7221.013,The CDC responsibilities under the consent decree and 2017 accountability ordinance include the review of Seattle police Department policies and we cannot do this job without this information.,47,,
758,0.97,7221.013,7235.828,"Please immediately send us call copies of policy changes and related memoranda that have occurred to date and all policy changes and memoranda that are going forward, as they occur.",47,,
759,0.97,7235.828,7273.933,"In the spirit of this request, which was more directed to chief best and the executive regarding the recent order about cs gas, I think that plea for us to honor the role granted to the CPC in the 2017 accountability legislation as well as in the consent decree, keep in mind that the CPC was the first Community-Based organization in the nation to be granted Amicus status and a consent decree.",47,,
760,0.97,7273.933,7286.345,So in that spirit I have shared Councilmember Sawant's bill with the CPC and then I understand they are meeting today.,47,,
761,0.97,7286.345,7294.987,They understand we have a quick turnaround and I'm seeking the recommendations as it relates to their role.,47,,
762,0.97,7294.987,7296.389,And any amendments that they might propose.,47,,
763,0.97,7296.389,7302.695,I have alerted Councilmember Sawant of this a couple of days ago.,47,,
764,0.97,7302.695,7304.93,And I'm very supportive of the legislation.,47,,
765,0.97,7304.93,7316.575,"But again, I want to make sure that we are honoring our obligation to consult with the CPC on policy, within their jurisdiction.",47,,
766,0.97,7316.575,7321.514,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",48,,
767,0.97,7321.514,7326.319,I think those are excellent points.,48,,
768,0.97,7326.319,7336.028,"And I think that all three accountability entities are pointing out, sort of a flaw in approach that they are seeing from the executive side.",48,,
769,0.97,7336.028,7341.033,And I think it is prudent for us to make sure that we are not replicating that.,48,,
770,0.97,7341.033,7346.906,"And I don't mean that as a slight to you, Councilmember Sawant.",48,,
771,0.97,7346.906,7355.314,"Things are moving very fast and I appreciate the spirit with which you are proposing the legislation, which I also support.",48,,
772,0.97,7355.314,7380.539,"I think that we can just benefit from making sure that we are advancing the bill and not through the process, inadvertently you know minimizing the role and significance of our accountability entities as previously approved by the full city council.",48,,
773,0.97,7380.539,7382.608,So look forward to hearing those recommendations.,48,,
774,0.97,7382.608,7387.813,"I suspect, although I don't know, I suspect they will be Bearable to your legislation.",48,,
775,0.97,7387.813,7404.697,"And I look forward to Councilmember Herbold leadership and hopefully with your cooperation, Councilmember Sawant are making sure we get the representation sooner rather than later because as he pointed out, time is of the essence here.",48,,
776,0.97,7404.697,7412.805,"These are short-term, Short- term impacts and severe negative impacts we need to act swiftly on.",48,,
777,0.97,7412.805,7428.12,Certainly we don't want to have undue delay in getting this bill before the city Council and considered so we can begin the process of implementation here.,48,,
778,0.97,7428.12,7432.792,"Councilmember Sawant, I imagine that you want to add something here.",48,,
779,0.97,7432.792,7435.394,I want to hand it over to you so you can do that.,48,,
780,0.97,7435.394,7437.63,Thank you.,49,,
781,0.97,7437.63,7445.571,I of course want to say I'm happy for the community police position to give their thoughts.,49,,
782,0.97,7445.571,7455.047,And my staff of course were planning to be in touch with them throughout this week because the bill will not be voted on this week.,49,,
783,0.97,7455.047,7460.553,It will be voted on next Monday.,49,,
784,0.97,7460.553,7465.424,"And I welcome, as I said I welcome their suggestions.",49,,
785,0.97,7465.424,7466.058,And their ideas.,49,,
786,0.97,7466.058,7476.569,But I want to be very clear.,49,,
787,0.97,7479.104,7485.044,"At the end of the day, Seattle working people and ordinary people and young people and the protest movement and our communities of color are not asking for recommendations.",49,,
788,0.97,7485.044,7488.48,What they are demanding is a law to prohibit people from getting gassed by the Seattle police.,49,,
789,0.97,7488.48,7491.217,"And so if we are talking about leadership, I agree, let's show leadership.",49,,
790,0.97,7491.217,7493.085,Leadership means doing what we were elected to do.,49,,
791,0.97,7493.085,7509.301,"The community police Commission, the Commission's work is extremely appreciated and honored but at the end of the day the city council is the highest legislative body and we are elected, they are not.",49,,
792,0.97,7509.301,7514.607,We have a duty as elected representatives to defend the tens of thousands of constituents were daily being gassed and harmed by the SPD.,49,,
793,0.97,7514.607,7534.627,"In reality, a powerful study in response to whatever the Mayor's office comes up with about study this and study that, a powerful study has been conducted by thousands of people in the laboratory of struggle on the streets of Seattle.",49,,
794,0.97,7534.627,7538.13,"And hundreds of thousands, if not millions on the streets of other cities over the past week.",49,,
795,0.97,7538.13,7542.735,The results from that laboratory analysis are that chemical weapons should be banned.,49,,
796,0.97,7542.735,7549.441,Thank you Councilmember Sawant for those additional remarks.,50,,
797,0.97,7549.441,7553.212,"Again, I don't think there's any disagreements.",50,,
798,0.97,7553.212,7570.462,"I hope that you don't take at least my comments as sort of an token and stick to what you're trying to accomplish, I absolutely agree it is up to us to pass this law.",50,,
799,0.97,7570.462,7575.768,And I think that the law you have proposed well only be strengthened and benefited by having the accountability entities weigh in formally on it.,50,,
800,0.97,7575.768,7582.274,I really appreciate your state of intent to do that engagement this week.,50,,
801,0.97,7582.274,7590.783,So that we can have the benefit--of their perspective before we vote on this on Monday.,50,,
802,0.97,7590.783,7599.758,"And again, these are three entities that have previously articulated their opposition to the use of Teargas.",50,,
803,0.97,7599.758,7603.796,And crowd management tactics.,50,,
804,0.97,7603.796,7636.996,"And so looking forward to hearing more of what they have to say and if there is anything that my office can do to help facilitate the connection there, and I'm sure Councilmember--Councilmember Herbold, we could share the letter we received with all the counsel, but certainly with Councilmember Sawant as the prime sponsor of the spell to make sure that her staff and that she have the full benefit of the information and that sort of approach being suggested by the CPC and others.",50,,
805,0.97,7636.996,7641.934,"So looking forward, looking forward to that, ongoing conversation there.",50,,
806,0.97,7641.934,7651.944,Any other questions or comments for Councilmember Sawant on her report?,50,,
807,0.97,7651.944,7656.815,"Councilmember Sawant, any parting words before we go ahead and move on?",50,,

955,0.97,8774.232,8782.673,But I'm bringing up the fact that it does show Unfortunately that our presence alone is not always going to be enough.,59,,
956,0.97,8782.673,8794.485,That's more evidence that we need to be pursuing action through legislative powers to provide that safer guarantee to peaceful demonstrators.,59,,

1004,0.97,9154.712,9161.886,"I do want to say, though, now more than ever, it's important that we center black voices in our deliberations about how to proceed.",62,,
1005,0.97,9161.886,9173.03,And I do want to acknowledge that the black community is not monolithic.,62,,
1006,0.97,9173.03,9178.903,There are many who represent the community.,62,,
1007,0.97,9178.903,9180.671,Some represent more radical perspectives.,62,,
1008,0.97,9180.671,9182.54,And all of that is okay.,62,,
1009,0.97,9182.54,9186.81,But it's important we're transparent about who we're working with.,62,,
1010,0.97,9186.81,9200.791,"At the rally in my district yesterday, here's what I heard from black community leaders who spoke, including Garrett and Oliver.",62,,
1011,0.97,9200.791,9203.294,Invest in black land ownership.,62,,
1012,0.97,9203.294,9204.261,Invest in violence prevention.,62,,
1013,0.97,9204.261,9220.044,"Invest in healthy communities, and that means housing that's affordable, well paying green job opportunities, high quality education, Digital equity, access to healthy food, clean water, places to place and rest.",62,,
1014,0.97,9220.044,9226.55,I also did hear loud and clear that we need to cut the police Department budget in half.,62,,
1015,0.97,9226.55,9241.699,"For far too long the Department under the shield of public safety has not supported workers, has exploited labor laws and resisted accountability measures that do not serve our neighbors.",62,,
1016,0.97,9241.699,9242.9,All with taxpayer dollars.,62,,
1017,0.97,9242.9,9247.204,I heard yesterday that the changes that we need are structural.,62,,
1018,0.97,9247.204,9250.541,We need to change the institution of policing.,62,,
1019,0.97,9250.541,9259.45,"Transforming the social contract with our community to Reimagine the way that we provide Community-Based programs and services, this is going to be a heavy lift.",62,,
1020,0.97,9259.45,9260.784,There's no doubt about it.,62,,
1021,0.97,9260.784,9262.353,And it will require our focus.,62,,
1022,0.97,9262.353,9271.428,"But I think we're up to the task, and I'm happy to hear so many Council members committed to the work.",62,,
1023,0.97,9271.428,9278.302,And there's many calling for the eight can't wait actions supported by campaign zero.,62,,
1024,0.97,9278.302,9284.074,The problem is we have many of the policies in place in Seattle that they're calling for.,62,,
1025,0.97,9284.074,9289.613,And we still have a problem with police brutality.,62,,
1026,0.97,9289.613,9291.515,We have Deescalation strategies in place.,62,,
1027,0.97,9291.515,9299.156,We have a use of force continue already.,62,,
1028,0.97,9299.156,9300.758,But none of these matters.,62,,
1029,0.97,9300.758,9305.062,That's why we're talking about Defunding the police by 50%.,62,,
1030,0.97,9305.062,9311.735,"And instead, investing in our communities.",62,,
1031,0.97,9311.735,9319.176,Because our previous attempts to legislate a more just police Department have been met with resistance far too long.,62,,
1032,0.97,9319.176,9338.595,"And the last thing I want to say, I want to mention a letter sent by the raising social justice initiative Coleads from across the city, these are the staff members in different departments charged with helping implement and put into place raising social justice principles in the city.",62,,
1033,0.97,9338.595,9353.644,"Part of that we have said in this historic moment, many of the Coleads who are collectives of racial justice add VO cats and other leaders in the city sent the letter to the Mayor.",62,,
1034,0.97,9353.644,9362.786,And the letter calls on her to respond to community demands to Defund and Demilitaryize the Seattle police Department.,62,,
1035,0.97,9362.786,9371.795,They call on her to fund Community-Based health and safe programs and increase police accountability.,62,,
1036,0.97,9371.795,9378.235,The letter does identify specific actions to help make the demands for systemic change a reality.,62,,
1037,0.97,9378.235,9382.372,I want to read through some of those demands.,62,,
1038,0.97,9382.372,9390.748,A long-term hiring and recruitment freeze for police officers as part of the Defunding the budget by 50% or more.,62,,
1039,0.97,9390.748,9405.195,A Community-Led racial equity analysis of S.P.D .'s budget that identifies specific city investments and alternatives to policing that advance public health and safety goals.,62,,
1040,0.97,9405.195,9419.51,Creating and enforcing Deescalation protocols specific to protests and eliminating the use of so called less lethal weapons that creates an environment that Engenders violent Confronttion.,62,,
1041,0.97,9419.51,9420.411,Renegotiating the Union contract.,62,,
1042,0.97,9420.411,9433.59,"And a call for the Mayor to acknowledge her own whiteness and complicity in systemic racism and to take principles, consistent, and accountable actions for racial justice.",62,,
1043,0.97,9433.59,9453.443,The demands in the letter are intended to serve as a starting point for ongoing and Transformational actions by the Mayor and all city staff that support the call to action from black people and other people of color in our community impacted by structural racism.,62,,
1044,0.97,9453.443,9464.254,I'm excited to work with my colleagues to change the oppressive systems in our community and stand in solidarity with our black and Brown neighbors.,62,,
1045,0.97,9464.254,9471.395,I'm looking forward to the work we're about to begin.,62,,
1046,0.97,9471.395,9471.795,That's all I have.,62,,
1047,0.97,9471.795,9473.697,.,62,,
1048,0.97,9473.697,9479.67,"Thank you, council member Morales for the words and reading from the letter.",63,,
1049,0.97,9479.67,9483.24,"Any questions or comments on that report, colleagues?",63,,
1050,0.97,9483.24,9484.241,Okay.,63,,
1051,0.97,9484.241,9491.748,"Seeing and hearing none, we will go ahead and conclude today's report.",63,,
1052,0.97,9491.748,9506.73,"Actually, before I go, I got a note from Council member Mosqueda that she forgot to mention something on her report.",63,,
1053,0.97,9506.73,9511.568,"If you're still with us, now could be a good time to do that.",63,,
1054,0.97,9511.568,9517.708,I'm not seeing your Video feed.,63,,
1055,0.97,9517.708,9523.413,I'm shifting to Council member Herbold who raised her hand.,63,,
1056,0.97,9523.413,9524.114,Thank you.,64,,
1057,0.97,9524.114,9533.891,I got Late-Breaking news about the public safety meeting that I Referenced earlier in the meeting.,64,,

1062,0.97,9552.776,9565.789,"And I am understanding of the need for them to Prioritize that work and for that reason, we are going to be actually cancelling the public safety and human services committee meeting.",64,,

1071,0.97,9594.351,9608.231,"On today's fun Council agenda, we have Council bill 119802.",66,,
1072,0.97,9608.231,9614.705,This is a transfer of the Uw laundry facilities to the city.,66,,
1073,0.97,9614.705,9637.194,"This authorizes the city to accept at no cost the transfer of property at the laundry site for the laundry site near Mount Baker light rail station from the University of Washington for the purpose of development of affordable housing along with other potential educational research and clinical uses, including an early learning facility.",66,,
1074,0.97,9637.194,9645.736,This is an exciting opportunity for affordable housing with other amenities and services.,66,,
1075,0.97,9645.736,9649.539,The legislation introduced today is routine legislation that accepts the property.,66,,
1076,0.97,9649.539,9651.641,They will inform the plan for the project.,66,,

1086,0.97,9694.684,9695.452,Great.,67,,
1087,0.97,9695.452,9703.427,"Colleagues, I will conclude today's Council briefing by giving a quick report from me.",67,,
1088,0.97,9703.427,9707.397,There is an item of action from my office on this afternoon's agenda.,67,,
1089,0.97,9707.397,9717.24,I circulated this last week on Thursday.,67,,
1090,0.97,9717.24,9731.054,"So it included a memorandum explaining proposed resolution 31947, which would amend our standing committee schedule to suspend regular committee meetings between June 15th and July 17th.",67,,
1091,0.97,9731.054,9758.482,"This action I believe is necessary in order to allow the Council and our Council central staff to focus on efforts--to focus all of our efforts and resources on the challenging decisions before us regarding changes to the 2020 adopted budget, which we have had much conversation about and budget chairman walked us through the road map of what to expect in this conversations.",67,,
1092,0.97,9758.482,9771.628,"Again, I understand that a continued suspension of the regular committee schedule, which has been effectively on hold since early March has an impact on your work plans and your committees' work flow.",67,,
1093,0.97,9771.628,9778.835,"And while regular meetings will be suspended, it's not the case that all Nonbudget Council business needs to end.",67,,
1094,0.97,9778.835,9790.413,The city still faces critical and time sensitive matters that require our attention and we will do our best to allow the Council to take up the matters during full council.,67,,
1095,0.97,9790.413,9813.804,"I would ask you please alert me and central staff to items that you believe require Council action in the next six weeks so that we can make a determination as to the best path forward for addressing those particular policies, whether it's through the regular city council meetings or through the scheduling of the special committee meetings.",67,,
1096,0.97,9813.804,9834.224,"I don't want to be completely inflexible, but as I mentioned last week, ordinarily when we undergo the budget process, there is a practice on the city Council to suspend regular committee meetings in order to allow us all to focus on the budget process.",67,,
1097,0.97,9834.224,9836.393,I think this is absolutely necessary at this time.,67,,
1098,0.97,9836.393,9857.147,And this is designed to support and facilitate budget chair's efforts to make sure that we have all hands on deck and all resources available to plow through the many questions and conversations what we'll be facing in the next six weeks.,67,,
1099,0.97,9857.147,9859.816,I'm happy to answer any questions.,67,,
1100,0.97,9859.816,9876.466,I do look forward to your support in making sure that we are effectively able to Shepard our limited resources and people power in this way to support the budget work that needs to occur over the next six weeks.,67,,
1101,0.97,9876.466,9888.478,"Colleagues, any questions about the resolution or any aspects of the memo that I circulated?",67,,
1102,0.97,9888.478,9890.08,Okay.,67,,
1103,0.97,9890.08,9890.28,Great.,67,,
1104,0.97,9890.28,9894.417,I don't have anything else to report at this time.,67,,
1105,0.97,9894.417,9902.626,"So if there is not anything else for the good of the order, we can conclude.",67,,
1106,0.97,9902.626,9903.159,"Anything else, colleagues?",67,,
1107,0.97,9903.159,9903.66,Seeing and hearing none.,67,,
1108,0.97,9903.66,9910.3,"Colleagues, that concludes our items of business for this morning.",67,,
1109,0.97,9910.3,9911.801,We will now be adjourned.,67,,
1110,0.97,9911.801,9915.472,And I will see all of you at 2:00 P.M.,67,,

1118,0.97,9951.908,9960.183,"Although, I know for many of my colleagues and myself, our voice mail is completely full after this weekend.",67,,
1119,0.97,9960.183,9967.257,And we are working really hard to clear out the backlog of the voice mails.,67,,
1120,0.97,9967.257,9974.431,E-mail is a much more effective way of getting Ahold of us and Gettings your public testimony.,67,,
1121,0.97,9974.431,9981.938,"Again, you must Preregister for public comment if you intend to give public comment this afternoon.",67,,
