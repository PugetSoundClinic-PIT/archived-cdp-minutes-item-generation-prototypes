28,0.97,90.623,101.835,"Really quickly, on approval of the minutes, my last time we were here together in Council briefing, my script incorrectly Referencing adopting the May 5th briefing minutes.",20,,
29,0.97,101.901,117.083,"I want to clarify we were adapting and did in fact adapt the May 4TH Council briefing minutes, so I apologize for any confusion for the public or my colleagues on that small error.",20,,
30,0.97,117.15,121.187,So we will now move onto the adoption of minutes.,20,,
31,0.97,121.254,129.362,"There is no objection, the minutes of May 11th, 2020, will be adopted.",20,,
32,0.97,129.429,133.099,"Hearing no objection, the minutes are adopted.",20,,
33,0.97,133.166,141.207,"President's report, I'm going to go ahead and dispense with the President's report today since we have a full agenda.",20,,
34,0.97,141.274,150.917,"I am going to go ahead and quickly introduce our first briefing item, which is the state legislative session update.",20,,
35,0.97,150.984,164.03,"I would like to introduce of course, our colleagues over at the office of Intergovernmental relations who will give us their sine die report of the 2020 Washington state legislative session.",20,,
36,0.97,164.097,176.342,This briefing will include important updates about changes to the state's budget in the form of Vetoes by the governor that have occurred in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and resulting in economic crisis.,20,,
37,0.97,176.409,192.825,"2020 sine die report was included on the published Council briefing agenda for this morning, colleagues, so you can follow along there, and the public can also follow along there as well.",20,,
38,0.97,192.892,224.057,"We are slated to hear from our Intergovernmental relations team until 10:05:00 a.m., so what I will ask is that colleague, that we allow Oir to go through the entirety to their presentation and reserve your questions until the end, so let's, I think that has worked well in past presentations so I imagine we'll have a lot of interest in this particular subject matter, as we should.",20,,
39,0.97,224.123,235.268,"Again, hold your questions until the end of the presentation and I'll make sure to call on you as soon as we're done with the presentation.",20,,
40,0.97,235.335,237.637,Let's go ahead and kick it off.,20,,
41,0.97,237.704,243.242,"I imagine, Lily, you'll get us started, so I'll hand it over to you.",20,,
42,0.97,243.309,243.543,I will.,21,,
43,0.97,243.61,244.277,Have I successfully Unmuted?,21,,
44,0.97,244.344,245.445,You have.,22,,
45,0.97,245.511,246.512,We can hear you.,22,,
46,0.97,246.579,246.913,Great.,23,,
47,0.97,246.98,264.397,"Thank you, Council President, Lily Wilson-Codega, director of the office of Intergovernmental relations, I'll do Intertroes, I'm joined by Cheryl SWAB, Oir deputy director along with Robin Koskey and Quinn Majeski, our state relations team.",23,,
48,0.97,264.464,282.415,"Although they passed the House Friday evening, given that legislation will not be taken up by the U.S. Senate in the Timeline for the next congressional package will not be pushed out until early June, we're here specifically to report on our state legislative action with our state team.",23,,
49,0.97,282.482,296.496,"Although there is no clear Timeline for a special session at this point, we will continue to update you all as we learn more from leadership and Seattle delegation as the Timeline evolves and today we'll begin with just kind of an over view of the format.",23,,
50,0.97,296.562,309.876,"A report from Robin Koskey, our state relations director, on the state capital and operating budgets developments and she may also have additional details on special session given how quickly things can change over the weekend.",23,,
51,0.97,309.942,335.301,"Quinn Majeski will then provide a transportation budget over view and after that, time permitting, we know we'll stick to 10:00, we'll do a brief review of your sine die report which you all have, highlighting some of the highlights on Council's priorities in terms of the education, public safety, and transportation, and with that, I will turn it over to Robin Koskey, our state relations director.",23,,
52,0.97,335.368,338.838,"Good morning, everyone it is really nice to be here with you.",24,,
53,0.97,338.905,355.755,"I will admit that the end of the legislative session seems like quite a long time ago, but Uncharacteristically right now, we're in a very active time and are engaging with our delegation, you know, like Lily said, thinking about the special session coming up.",24,,
54,0.97,355.822,361.494,The sine die report was submitted to you a few weeks ago.,24,,
55,0.97,361.561,366.332,I just wanted to pause for a brief moment to thank our lobbying team.,24,,
56,0.97,366.399,395.261,"You hear from us, the city staff, all of the time and we have chosen to not have our contract lobbyists come up and provide updates so you haven't been seeing them as often, but they are on the ground in Olympia, helping us all of the time covering lots of different issues that is Rebecca Johnson, Pam Krohn, Nancy Sapiro and Jay Manning.",24,,
57,0.97,395.328,405.071,We want to extend gratitude to them for helping us and helping the city get the legislative priorities passed.,24,,
58,0.97,405.138,410.243,I want to start out by actually taking a moment to celebrate a big win for the city of Seattle.,24,,
59,0.97,410.309,419.285,"I wanted to hand it over to Quinn to discuss the legislation, especially since we're not getting to celebrate very much these days.",24,,
60,0.97,419.352,423.289,"Quinn, if you can give the details to that, I would appreciate it.",24,,
61,0.97,423.356,423.623,Absolutely.,25,,
62,0.97,423.689,431.164,"Thank you, Robin and thank you, Council members, for having us Digitally present this morning.",25,,
63,0.97,431.23,437.77,"I did want to highlight one, you know, significant win which was the enforcement legislation.",25,,
64,0.97,437.837,462.495,"From the outset, I want to thank the work that was done by a number of folks within the city, in particular, chief Skoggins from the Seattle fire Department and multiple representatives from the police Department an speaking to the benefits to the legislation as well as our partners in this effort, in particular, the folks who did some really significant and profound advocacy around this issue.",25,,
65,0.97,462.562,468.501,"From the outset, wanted to call out those efforts.",25,,
66,0.97,468.568,482.348,"The legislation that was passed is a pilot program that, for the next three years, will allow the city to enforce transit Lane violations through automated traffic cameras.",25,,
67,0.97,482.415,483.416,It is limited within the city.,25,,
68,0.97,483.482,489.021,This is largely in line with the update that we gave during session.,25,,
69,0.97,489.088,492.091,It didn't ultimately change toward the tail end session very much.,25,,
70,0.97,492.158,508.608,"It is limited to the greater downtown area, SR 99 and the West Seattle bridge, but also the low bridge, which will be particularly useful as we continue to work through the impacts of the West Seattle bridge closure.",25,,
71,0.97,508.674,519.252,The transit Lane violations are limited to any specific locations but the enforcement of the box is limited to 20 locations within the geographic area.,25,,
72,0.97,519.318,535.101,"The legislation goes into effect on June 11th, but for the remainder of this year, all Violators will receive a warning with no monetary citation, so monetary citations will begin January 1st, 2021.",25,,
73,0.97,535.167,540.406,The citation amounts are limited to $75.,25,,
74,0.97,540.473,548.848,"Any revenue that is generated beyond the cost of operating, maintaining, and implementing the program, 50% will be retained by the city.",25,,
75,0.97,548.915,552.652,50% will be remitted to the state.,25,,
76,0.97,552.718,566.299,"The city's portion must be spent on improvements to accessibility and equitable transportation in particular, Ada improvements.",25,,
77,0.97,566.365,581.013,"In terms of implementation, there is a work group that has been set up with S-Dot and SPD that is beginning to work through some of the implementation processes and procedures, so I expect you'll hear from them sometime later this year.",25,,
78,0.97,581.08,590.823,And I do also want to make a special note to thank Council member Strauss for coming down to Olympia and Testifying multiple times on this effort.,25,,
79,0.97,590.89,595.661,Thank you for your work on that issue.,25,,
80,0.97,595.728,596.829,"Thank you very much, Quinn.",26,,
81,0.97,596.896,603.402,Now I'll move to talk a little bit about the supplemental operating budget.,26,,
82,0.97,603.469,605.371,"As we said, there were many Vetoes.",26,,
83,0.97,605.438,614.847,"However, one area of the budget that was not touched at all by the governor's veto pen was the housing and homelessness budget.",26,,
84,0.97,614.914,634.767,There was a $60 million increase for shelter capacity that was included in the budget at $20 million of these funds and an additional 10 million from the disaster response account are being allocated to counties for the Covid outbreak housing grants.,26,,
85,0.97,634.834,642.441,That money has gotten out on the street and the county received $10.7 million of those funds.,26,,
86,0.97,642.508,655.087,"The city actually was involved in helping the county's scope, a requirement of the legislation, what the money would be used for, and I will get back to everyone to see exactly how that money is being allocated.",26,,
87,0.97,655.154,659.925,"That information, we don't have right now, but I have asked the county to provide that to us.",26,,
88,0.97,659.992,665.431,There is also $40 million for the housing trust fund in the capital budget.,26,,
89,0.97,665.498,675.307,"There was $15 million for the housing and essential needs program, and an additional $420,000 to extend the program to pregnant women.",26,,
90,0.97,675.374,699.432,"There were $15 million in the budget per year, so a Reoccurring expense for five years for permanent supportive housing operations and maintenance, and then there was a $5 million pilot program to address the housing needs of extremely low income seniors a and people with disabilities and high cost counties and King County is one of those counties.",26,,
91,0.97,699.498,712.678,"As far as the Vetoes go, there were $235 million total vetoed for 2020 and then an additional 210 million for the next annual budget.",26,,
92,0.97,712.745,730.329,"Some of the things that were, unfortunately, vetoed, and I do think that the governor didn't do this very lightly, you know, I think he was disappointed that he needed to do this, but felt it was what needed to happen for the physical health of the state.",26,,
93,0.97,730.396,741.607,"Education, counselors in high poverty schools and Paraeducator training, the $50 million included in the budget to address the climate crisis, Postpartum Medicaid coverage was also cut.",26,,
94,0.97,741.674,754.353,"There was a big reduction in the funds to expand early learning instead of 15 million, it is only 2 million.",26,,
95,0.97,754.42,755.187,$13 million was vetoed.,26,,
96,0.97,755.254,773.873,"In the end of the sine die report, we included a list of all of the Vetoes, just so you could get an idea of the scope of them and you know, there were many, many areas of the budget that were impacted, so it wasn't as if the things that the city cared about were the only things that were targeted.",26,,
97,0.97,773.939,792.892,"And then the pacer program, I know that is an issue that this Council has been interested in, the governor vetoed the $46,000 that was in the budget to implement a statewide program, stating it was not sufficient to get the program started but the counties may implement.",26,,
98,0.97,792.958,807.506,"As I understand it, there is the coalition that supported the legislation as working on getting a tool kit together so it will be easier for counties to get that going, get the program going all over the state.",26,,
99,0.97,807.573,814.747,"Also, just wanted to note that the capital budget was quite small this year, but that was also--there were no vetoed in that at all.",26,,
100,0.97,814.813,815.748,That was accepted in total.,26,,
101,0.97,815.814,821.987,I'll hand it back over to Quinn to discuss the transportation budget again.,26,,
102,0.97,822.054,822.521,"Thank you, Robin.",27,,
103,0.97,822.588,859.825,"On the transportation budget side, you may recall that even before all of the Coronavirus crisis emerged, the state was in a rather negative budget situation due to the impacts of I--976 despite the ongoing legal debate about the initiative, the state's response was to treat I-976 as law and as such, the transportation budget began with a $457 million deficit.",27,,
104,0.97,859.892,869.134,"They were able through the budget process, to ultimately do a good job of mitigating and addressing that short fall.",27,,
105,0.97,869.201,889.021,"They did this through a combination of capturing project under runs, so cost of living and existing transportation projects, some fun shifts that were able to Mutt debate and some balances and other reserves.",27,,
106,0.97,889.088,894.126,"Ultimately, the transportation budget is largely in tact and made a few select investments.",27,,
107,0.97,894.193,899.265,It Unpaused the projects that the governor had put on pause after the passage of the initiative.,27,,
108,0.97,899.331,912.111,I will note that it is a different and distinct pause from the current pause that is occurring due to the public health crisis.,27,,
109,0.97,912.177,927.626,"It added 25 million for the Viaduct and 6.7 6.2 million for Northbound I-5 at Seneca, which are two Wash-Dot projects that we have a local interest in here in the city.",27,,
110,0.97,927.693,936.235,That funding is necessary to keep them on track and on schedule.,27,,
111,0.97,936.302,944.977,"It did reduce the direct distribution of gas tax revenue by 10, the local impact which will be $260,000 per year.",27,,
112,0.97,945.044,953.052,"Then Finally, I will note, although this is not a direct impact to the city it is something we have an interest in.",27,,
113,0.97,953.118,973.205,"It assumes 7.1 million in cost savings by requiring sun transit to pay what the state believes is the full cost of collecting the car tab values for the Department of licensing, effectively a cost shift from Department of licensing on to sound transit.",27,,
114,0.97,973.272,1014.346,"I think, in terms of Vetoes, I want to note, there were no substitute Vetoes of the transportation budget but the governor did veto a statement of legislative intent saying that the projects that were identified were intended to be funded and completed and in that veto message, did make a specific note that based on the combined impacts of I-976 in further years, which are expected to be significant, more significant, as well as the ongoing decline in the revenues as related to Covid-19, that there may be delays or cancellations of projects that are made at his executive discretion.",27,,
115,0.97,1014.413,1017.883,There is no specific veto but we will need to monitor the impacts.,27,,
116,0.97,1017.95,1020.219,There may be projects that are delayed or cancelled.,27,,
117,0.97,1020.285,1025.357,That is the general over view of the transportation budget.,27,,
118,0.97,1025.424,1030.329,"As I mentioned, the impacts of 976 are expected to grow next year.",27,,
119,0.97,1030.396,1038.07,That will be a short fall of 684 million.,27,,
120,0.97,1038.137,1060.325,"There is a significant decline in revenues in gas tax and other revenues that are coming into the transportation budget, so although the chairs and the governor were able to more or less mitigate the impacts this year, the budget picture for next year is significantly worse.",27,,
121,0.97,1060.392,1062.06,"Thank you very much, Quinn.",28,,
122,0.97,1062.127,1071.67,"I'm going to, well, first I want to touch briefly on House bill 2965, which was the $200 million in funding for Covid-19 relief.",28,,
123,0.97,1071.737,1074.173,I'm not going to talk about that a lot.,28,,
124,0.97,1074.239,1077.91,We did mention that in the last briefing.,28,,
125,0.97,1077.976,1089.221,We just wanted to remind everyone that it did happen and the city received a $13 million allocation from the fund that the budget office is working on with the executive in terms of how that money will be used.,28,,
126,0.97,1089.288,1108.273,We did work really hard to get it to be fairly broad so that we could use it in budget areas where we were not going to get FEMA reimbursement or we didn't think there would be other things to pay for as a place to fill in the gaps and I think it is going to be effective in doing that for sure.,28,,
127,0.97,1108.34,1118.383,"As far as special session goes, you know, I think that of course, I'm sure everyone realizes that the state is suffering from the same kinds of budget impacts that we are at the city.",28,,
128,0.97,1118.45,1124.056,There is lots of concern about the state budget of course.,28,,
129,0.97,1124.122,1138.937,"Friday I understood from one of the members of the delegation that the revenue forecast in June is going to be a bit worse than they expected, so sorry to be the Bringer of bad news, but unfortunately that is the case.",28,,
130,0.97,1139.004,1140.706,"As Lily said, we're not sure.",28,,
131,0.97,1140.772,1143.642,We do think there will be a special session.,28,,
132,0.97,1143.709,1146.111,We're just not sure exactly when it would be.,28,,
133,0.97,1146.178,1148.146,It could be as early as June.,28,,
134,0.97,1148.213,1152.985,It also could be in August or maybe even possibly later in the fall.,28,,
135,0.97,1153.051,1158.757,I do think that the scope of the special session will be rather limited.,28,,
136,0.97,1158.824,1165.531,It won't be--it will be things that I think are directly related to Covid and related to the budget.,28,,
137,0.97,1165.597,1179.878,"I think they will make it very short and so, you know, I think that puts us on notice that we should be doing our advocacy and checking in with the delegation which we are actively doing.",28,,
138,0.97,1179.945,1183.315,I want to talk about the open public meetings act.,28,,
139,0.97,1183.382,1187.119,I know that is very high concern to this Council.,28,,
140,0.97,1187.185,1198.697,"We're working with other cities because obviously this is an issue that is shared by, you know, just about every city in the state and also with the Association of Washington cities.",28,,
141,0.97,1198.764,1215.847,"They have asked, and we have, in coalition, asked for a new proclamation that could expand the business conducted by Council and we're also working on a Legislationive approach, part of which could be done in the special session and part of which could be longer term.",28,,
142,0.97,1215.914,1220.052,It looks like it may be time for a more comprehensive revision.,28,,
143,0.97,1220.118,1221.42,It hasn't been touched since 1983.,28,,
144,0.97,1221.486,1232.364,"We're looking into how we might do that, but I think that is a longer term kind of thing that may be the 2021 legislative session.",28,,
145,0.97,1232.431,1245.01,"We're closely watching progress on the Undocumented worker relief Fund, which would provide assistance to Undocumented workers who are not eligible for unemployment insurance through Commnity based organizations.",28,,
146,0.97,1245.077,1261.994,"Director from the office of immigrant and refugee affairs and I participated in a call with the governor's office and broad coalition which includes one America, Acrs, economic lawsuit, unemployment law projects, labor you Knowers and many other organizations.",28,,
147,0.97,1262.06,1266.598,It is quite a broad coalition which is really wonderful.,28,,
148,0.97,1266.665,1283.015,"You know, the governor said he would take a look at what authority he had to create such a fund and whether legislative action was necessary and he did promise to get back to the coalition sometime this week about what his thoughts were so we're looking forward to that.",28,,
149,0.97,1283.081,1299.064,"You know, there is also a look at more permanent changes to provide wage assistance to Undocumented workers that is more expensive than a worker relief Fund.",28,,
150,0.97,1299.131,1319.384,"There is a proposal that Awc and representative Paulette are working on that would create revenue flexibility and options for cities including flexibility on the criminal justice sales tax, lodging sales tax, affordable housing sales tax.",28,,
151,0.97,1319.451,1344.109,"Levy LIFTS, Interfund loans and flexibility around audits and then Awc is also adopted a legislative agenda for the especially session which Councilmember Mosqueda participated in that meeting and that would include a 1% property tax cap and permitting review and approval requirements to make it easier to get projects under way.",28,,
152,0.97,1344.176,1353.418,"And then Finally, the other area that they're looking at is FEMA reimbursement.",28,,
153,0.97,1353.485,1361.46,The state originally said they would pay the 25% that FEMA usually pays 75% and they would pick up the tab for the extra 25%.,28,,
154,0.97,1361.526,1388.42,"They have now realized, given the scope of this crisis, that they do not have the budget authority to do that, so they're probably going to include a proposal during special session that would seek to provide additional funds to cities and local governments and they would cover either the whole 25% or perhaps half of the 25% so there would be less financial liability on the cities.",28,,
155,0.97,1388.487,1390.388,I wanted to talk briefly about recovery.,28,,
156,0.97,1390.455,1395.26,"I think while we're in the middle of the crisis, we at the city are starting to look at recovery.",28,,
157,0.97,1395.327,1403.034,The state is doing the same thing.,28,,
158,0.97,1403.101,1405.67,The governor has appointed three different task forces.,28,,
159,0.97,1405.737,1413.011,One is on public health and the Healthcare system being led by the Department of health Secretary John Weis man.,28,,
160,0.97,1413.078,1426.491,"One is on economic recovery led by Lisa Brown and then a social support group led by Department of social and health services, Cheryl strange.",28,,
161,0.97,1426.558,1434.699,The Senate is also looking at recovery and announced a bipartisan economic recovery group charged with making recommendations on recovery.,28,,
162,0.97,1434.766,1447.913,"It will be chaired by Senator frock, from our delegation, which is great news and the vice chair will be Senator Saldana from the delegation is also on the committee and they will have the first meeting in June.",28,,
163,0.97,1447.979,1455.253,"The meetings will be public, probably just like this on zoom, so we will be able to watch what happens.",28,,
164,0.97,1455.32,1459.691,There is also some slightly more informal groups that are being managed by the senators.,28,,
165,0.97,1459.758,1464.863,There is a business and non-profit group that Senator Mollett will chair.,28,,
166,0.97,1464.93,1473.338,"A people's work group, focused on how to support people on the individual level chaired by Senator Kaiser.",28,,
167,0.97,1473.405,1482.18,Economic trade group and then a stimulus and revenue stability committee being chaired by Senator.,28,,
168,0.97,1482.247,1488.153,"So I don't know, Lily, if you think we should shift to the sine die report to go through the details.",28,,
169,0.97,1488.22,1495.961,I know we only have maybe ten minutes left so I'm wondering if we should go to questions now.,28,,
170,0.97,1496.027,1503.702,"I think that makes sense, just maybe defer to the Council President Gonzalez.",29,,
171,0.97,1503.768,1505.07,We could do brief highlights.,29,,
172,0.97,1505.136,1511.176,"It will take a bit over four minutes, or hold that and open it up to questions.",29,,
173,0.97,1511.243,1511.977,I'll defer to you on that.,29,,
174,0.97,1512.043,1565.797,"In the interest of time because it is 9:56 and I imagine my colleagues have many questions, and we do have the sine die report that we can read through carefully, I would suggest that we go ahead and pause here on the presentation and allow Councilmembers to begin the process in order to ask questions about what you have presented on orally already and any other priorities or questions that we might have looking forward into 2021 or potential special session, so if that is okay with you all, I think, colleagues, we should begin the process of identifying who has any questions or comments for the Oir team.",30,,
175,0.97,1565.864,1571.803,"For those of you on Video, if you can start by raising your hand.",30,,
176,0.97,1571.87,1574.606,I'll call in the order I see your hand go up.,30,,
177,0.97,1574.673,1594.926,"If you're on the phone only, if you can ping me or use the chat function on zoom to just let me know you have a question, I can put you into the Queue.",30,,
178,0.97,1594.993,1595.894,"Councilmember Mosqueda, Councilmember Herbold.",30,,
179,0.97,1595.961,1598.63,Anybody else interested in questions or comments at this point?,30,,
180,0.97,1598.697,1598.83,Okay.,30,,
181,0.97,1598.897,1599.03,Great.,30,,
182,0.97,1599.097,1614.112,So I'm going to go ahead and hand it over to Councilmember Mosqueda first and then we'll hear from Councilmember Herbold and I may also have some questions and comments after my colleagues.,30,,
183,0.97,1614.179,1614.512,Good morning.,31,,
184,0.97,1614.579,1617.382,Thank you all so much for your work in Olympia.,31,,
185,0.97,1617.449,1626.224,I know it was two or three days after the sine die that we had this around Covid.,31,,
186,0.97,1626.291,1629.627,I know you have not had a chance to rest.,31,,
187,0.97,1629.694,1634.165,"Robin, you mentioned there was really no cuts to the housing and homelessness programs.",31,,
188,0.97,1634.232,1642.974,I know that the folks from our delegation advocated strongly for 13 million so we could potentially purchase a hotel.,31,,
189,0.97,1643.041,1645.31,That hotel was purchased by King County.,31,,
190,0.97,1645.377,1650.148,I do believe that the city still has 13 million that we can access.,31,,
191,0.97,1650.215,1656.154,Can you talk a little bit more about whether you know the status of where those dollars are at?,31,,
192,0.97,1656.221,1659.09,My understanding is Mid-March we received those already.,31,,
193,0.97,1659.157,1669.834,"Any concerns about the 13 million since the county used it for the hotel, which is great, but I just want to make sure we know where the 13 million is at, if it is at the city level still.",31,,
194,0.97,1669.901,1680.612,"You know, I do think it ended up working out pretty well given that all of the--it was actually, I believe the Department of social health and human services that purchased the hotel.",32,,
195,0.97,1680.678,1693.058,"They were all used for, not the hotel, it was a long-term care facility that had been taken out of use.",32,,
196,0.97,1693.124,1699.03,All of the money went to the same purpose for Covid-19 relief.,32,,
197,0.97,1699.097,1700.231,"Over all, that is really good.",32,,
198,0.97,1700.298,1715.08,"I think the budget office is working really hard to make sure that the money gets used as effectively as possible so that we're not using this very flexible resource to pay for something that could be, you know, paid for by a less flexible Federal resource.",32,,
199,0.97,1715.146,1723.121,That is what is taking a little time to fill the correct hole with the money that we have.,32,,
200,0.97,1723.188,1739.304,"I do understand that, you know, we're looking at spending the money on housing related uses, potentially hygiene facilities, you know, additional money to support shelters and permanent support of housing.",32,,
201,0.97,1739.37,1740.839,We're experiencing additional expenses.,32,,
202,0.97,1740.905,1754.085,"I believe that the executive is going to finalize that proposal and should communicate with you all, hopefully sometime this week or next, so that is coming very soon.",32,,
203,0.97,1754.152,1757.288,"You know, I do think that we're very grateful to the delegation.",32,,
204,0.97,1757.355,1763.261,I think we're the only city that received a direct allocation of the course as of yet.,32,,
205,0.97,1763.328,1769.3,We do feel very grateful that that happened.,32,,
206,0.97,1769.367,1771.269,Thank you so much.,33,,
207,0.97,1771.336,1777.108,We'll go ahead and head over to Councilmember Herbold for her questions and comments.,33,,
208,0.97,1777.175,1779.043,Thank you.,34,,
209,0.97,1779.11,1791.022,I just want to restate the request that I have made of Oir as it relates to a special session.,34,,
210,0.97,1791.089,1804.602,"I would like, should that happen, or maybe now, in preparation for that likelihood of that happening, for Oir to work with us in developing a legislative agenda.",34,,
211,0.97,1804.669,1831.262,"That is a Resource-Intensive effort and we don't have to do a legislative agenda the same we have done it for regular sessions but with the development of a resolution and passage, but I do think we should work to organize ourselves in such a way where we are identifying for the city of Seattle where the top priorities are.",34,,
212,0.97,1831.329,1840.305,A Process-Light version of a legislative agenda for a special session is something that I would request Oir to consider working with us to develop.,34,,
213,0.97,1840.371,1840.805,Thank you.,34,,
214,0.97,1840.872,1846.811,"Councilmember, I just wanted to give you a quick update on some of the policy priorities that you have identified.",35,,
215,0.97,1846.878,1856.521,We are doing some follow up with the appropriate legislative committee members both on revenue and some other issues that other Council members have identified.,35,,
216,0.97,1856.588,1876.474,"We are going through that process now and just you know, managing expectations around what the budget will look like is a goal but there are a lot of policy changes particularly around the Opma issues that we definitely understand the need to focus on, so that is in the works and we're working.",35,,
217,0.97,1876.541,1883.248,"I think it is Noel that is helping us with that, scheduling that with the Finance Committee members now.",35,,
218,0.97,1883.314,1897.528,"Yes, and you know, I think we were discussed many of the highlights of what we would include on the legislative agenda by what Council members have brought to us.",36,,
219,0.97,1897.595,1901.332,Let us know if there are issues that you haven't heard about.,36,,
220,0.97,1901.399,1918.283,"I think we'll have to play it by ear, dividing between what ends up on a special session, legislative agenda and what gets pushed into 2020, depending on what we're hearing from the legislators at the state level.",36,,
221,0.97,1918.349,1922.754,Thank you so much for that question.,37,,
222,0.97,1922.82,1932.897,"Colleagues, anyone else have any questions for members of the Oir staff?",37,,
223,0.97,1932.964,1933.097,Okay.,37,,
224,0.97,1933.164,1945.977,I just wanted to thank Oir team for their work and collaboration with my office and the law Department around the issues related to Opma.,37,,
225,0.97,1946.044,1979.677,"I have had the opportunity to have verbal conversations with members of the governor's executive team on a weekly call check in that I and the King County President have with them and reiterated once again my request that if the governor's proclamation is going to be extended, that it be modified in order to take into account the realities of how we need to operate as local government.",37,,
226,0.97,1979.744,2016.948,"The reality is that we do expect that the requirement of remote meetings will continue into the foreseeable future and as a result of that, can reasonably anticipate that the governor will continue to renew the authorization for remote meetings for all local governments and public agencies and again, you know, we need to make sure that we can continue to not only be responsive to the Covid-19 outbreak but also to the lasting effects of the public health emergency and related economic impacts.",37,,
227,0.97,2017.014,2136.467,"That is something that I have directly communicated to the governor's office, not just as recently as last week, but as early as April 21st in communication via the law Department with the general Council for the governor's office specifically requested that the governor look at modifying the proclamation to, again, allow this city Council and others to address not just matters necessary to respond to the Covid-19 outbreak and lasting effects of the public health emergency but the related economic impacts which we are all seeing statewide, country wide and across the world are real and we need to be able to be responsive to those in a way that is consistent with the open public meetings Act and so long as the proclamation 2028 is so strictly worded, it really does put cities like the city of Seattle at a disadvantage in terms of being able to be nimble and responsive to the needs that are emerging and that have been existing, that you know, we really need to continue to advocate and work with our partners around this in Washington city and others to make sure that they understand why this is such an important continuity of government issue and needs to be addressed in a manner that accurately reflects how technology is used these days and how technology will be a necessity in order to continue to meet public health orders and directives and minimize the exposure by people who come into our city or other places of public access to Coronavirus, so I just want to appreciate the work that you all have done to date.",37,,
228,0.97,2136.534,2156.42,"I know you have all shared my letter and communication with the governor's office, with the Association of Washington cities, they have indicated that they are going to continue to be supportive and also encourage similar changes to the proclamation as the governor looks at extending this into June.",37,,
229,0.97,2156.487,2186.017,"I think this is just such a top priority for so many local agencies, including the city of Seattle and I just can't emphasize enough how important it is for us to not just be able to deal with Covid-19 issues, but Noncovid related issues that existed well before this pandemic in a way that is going to be consistent with the open public meetings Act and those are sort of the shorter term needs, obviously, and as you have all flagged, the longer term needs will be around.",37,,
230,0.97,2186.083,2206.137,"How does the open public meetings act need to be modified in, sort of, a more sustainable way given it has not been reviewed since 1983 and obviously we live in a very different world very different Digital world.",37,,
231,0.97,2206.203,2228.025,I think it is important for us to ask the Legislature to take a reasonable look at the open public meetings act to account for how we access information and how we access public spaces in this day and age that is separate and apart from public comment.,37,,
232,0.97,2228.092,2258.489,"Again, I think those are important priorities for me and I think they're shared priorities amongst the members of the city Council and certainly I have heard the same from folks over at the Association of Washington cities and so I think this is a good opportunity for us to, again, modify that rubric in a way that is more realistic to how we access information in this day and age.",37,,
233,0.97,2258.556,2273.704,And I just wanted to note the governor's office has been very responsive to this request as has Awc and just to recognize Council Mosqueda has been doing a lot of work internally within Awc and leadership role there.,38,,
234,0.97,2273.771,2284.448,I think that will be critical moving forward given some of the Dynamics presenting obstacles for us currently.,38,,
235,0.97,2284.515,2288.953,We'll continue to Prioritize that moving forward into the special session.,38,,
236,0.97,2289.02,2299.397,And I wanted to add that I talked to a with FC as late as Friday afternoon and they were actively working on it on our behalf.,39,,
237,0.97,2299.463,2300.331,I really appreciate that.,40,,
238,0.97,2300.398,2327.258,"I know Councilmember Mosqueda and I have been talking about her fortunate and ability to sort of use her role on the board to build bridges there and continue to collaborate with the Awc around those points, appreciate that they have been so receptive and in my conversations with the governor's office, I feel like they have been also receptive and understanding of what the complexity of it is.",40,,
239,0.97,2327.324,2357.321,I think there is also an acknowledgement that Unfortunately this issue has become very political amongst state Legislature and that presents difficulties in terms of the requested flexibility and need to be more flexibility in proclamation bill 2028 and if it is extended into June.,40,,
240,0.97,2357.388,2363.761,"President Gonzalez, I had a question on something else before the team leaves.",41,,
241,0.97,2363.828,2366.33,"Yeah, sure.",42,,
242,0.97,2366.397,2368.599,"Councilmember Sawant, go ahead.",42,,
243,0.97,2368.666,2371.035,Thank you.,43,,
244,0.97,2371.102,2381.812,"If there are any updates and Adjustmented needs on that account, I completely agree they need to be made immediately because of the situation we're headed in.",43,,
245,0.97,2381.879,2382.813,This won't Abe short-term crisis.,43,,
246,0.97,2382.88,2396.327,We're heading into what economists are now confirming is absolutely going to be the worst crisis since the great depression but I also think that legal opinion is not definite about this.,43,,
247,0.97,2396.393,2408.305,One of the labor attorney that we did a press conference with last week said very clearly that the governor does not have the authority to tell the city council what to legislate and what to not legislate on.,43,,
248,0.97,2408.372,2412.176,We'll be speaking on that later on.,43,,
249,0.97,2412.243,2417.248,"Right now for the legislative team, I have a specific question.",43,,
250,0.97,2417.314,2431.262,"What conversations are happening about, again, precisely because of all of the things that are being said so far about the prolonged nature of the crisis we're heading into?",43,,
251,0.97,2431.328,2434.932,What kind of conversations are happening to avoid hostility?,43,,
252,0.97,2434.999,2451.916,"You know, the Seattle times of course, reported recently that in April, actually, and this is expecting there will be more things along these lines, in the near future, but already announced budget cuts related to climate programs.",43,,
253,0.97,2451.982,2467.331,"The other to quote the Seattle times article, the single biggest cut will be $116 million in new money to 2023 for school counselors in high profit school districts.",43,,
254,0.97,2467.398,2472.369,"Obviously, you know, the state Legislature has been Criminally under funding public schools.",43,,
255,0.97,2472.436,2489.62,We certainly don't want to see more cuts in public school funding but also in funding for other social needs which I think is inevitable because of the Gutting of public revenues as you have correctly reported.,43,,
256,0.97,2489.687,2547.244,"I wanted to share in relation to this question, one of the most recent--which is not politically aligned in any way to the social agenda that I support but it is interesting that they're recognizing what a deep crisis we're heading into and one of the papers on the Blog just from a few days ago says that while the pandemic is having an adverse effect on almost everyone in society, policies need to pay specific attention to preventing long-term damage or Scarring for the livelihoods of the least Advantaged in society and they are recommending, I don't have time to read the whole thing but they are recommending specific policy measures like public works programs to offer job opportunities funded by progressive measures and other financial and fiscal policies to prevent.",43,,
257,0.97,2547.311,2551.415,I'm wondering what are legislators saying and their specific statements.,43,,
258,0.97,2551.482,2551.715,Thank you.,43,,
259,0.97,2551.782,2572.703,"Councilmember Sawant, while I don't have any specific statements for you from individual legislators on this, what I will assure you of is that, you know, our Seattle delegation in particular, many of those folks have leadership roles in the progressive revenue conversation.",44,,
260,0.97,2572.77,2576.273,"I think at this stage, nothing is off the table.",44,,
261,0.97,2576.34,2595.192,"There is a lot of kind of unknown right now in terms of what the revenue forecast will look like, so legislators will have more clarity in June and then they will probably have to look at what types of Progressive revenue can fill the hole or attempt to fill the hole.",44,,
262,0.97,2595.259,2599.063,"Because of the ambiguity, we haven't seen any specific proposals.",44,,
263,0.97,2599.129,2605.169,"Please know that conversation is an active one, particularly within the Seattle delegation and a high priority.",44,,
264,0.97,2605.235,2607.471,Absolutely hear your concern on that.,44,,
265,0.97,2607.538,2615.412,We'll continue to Prioritize this issue as well and keep you updated as we find out more.,44,,
266,0.97,2615.479,2618.582,"Thank you so much for that, colleagues.",45,,
267,0.97,2618.649,2626.623,Any other questions or comments for the team before we go ahead and transition to the next agenda item?,45,,
268,0.97,2626.69,2627.157,Okay.,45,,
269,0.97,2627.224,2637.334,"Looks like no one else has any questions or comments, so thank you so much, everyone, from Oir for being with us this morning.",45,,
270,0.97,2637.401,2659.256,"Really appreciate your ongoing work in this space and look forward to some follow up on some of the issues that were flagged in and discussed this morning, also just want to say, again, I don't think anybody has said it out loud yet, but well done on the ban the box legislation.",45,,
271,0.97,2659.323,2674.805,"Very, very exciting, hard fought legislative effort and in a period of time when all of us are looking for unity and good news and a moment to celebrate collaboration and the good fruits that that can yield.",45,,
272,0.97,2674.872,2692.823,I really just want to say thank you for your ongoing effort on our behalf to get that across the finish line and thanks to all of the state legislatures who were so tremendously supportive and also diligent about finally getting that over the finish line.,45,,
273,0.97,2692.89,2694.758,Thank you so much for that.,45,,
274,0.97,2694.825,2700.264,"With that, we'll end on a good NOTE and say thank you so much and enjoy the rest of your week.",45,,
275,0.97,2700.33,2705.335,Thank you very much for having us.,46,,
276,0.97,2705.402,2706.537,Thank you.,47,,
277,0.97,2706.603,2707.104,Thank you.,48,,
278,0.97,2707.171,2710.641,"Okay, colleagues, we'll move along our briefing agenda.",49,,
279,0.97,2710.707,2712.609,"We're a little behind, about ten minutes.",49,,
280,0.97,2712.676,2716.847,But hopefully we'll be able to make up some time here.,49,,
281,0.97,2716.914,2729.293,"We'll go ahead and transition into agenda item 4, a presentation on Council bill 119793 which is paid sick and safe time for gig workers legislation.",49,,
282,0.97,2729.359,2754.985,"As you know in lieu of being able to have committee meetings and in particular to respect the sort of need and sensitivity around bringing essential workers to city hall more than necessary, we are integrating some conversations into Council briefings that are related to Covid-19 or routine and necessary pieces of legislation.",49,,
283,0.97,2755.052,2783.247,"This bill is only on the introduction and referral calendar this afternoon and Councilmember Mosqueda, a prime sponsor, requested time on the Council briefing agenda in order to have a transparent conversation about what this Council bill is and to do that early on, so this is just for discussion and we have Karina bull from Council central staff to walk us through a presentation.",49,,
284,0.97,2783.313,2785.149,"First I am going to, there she is.",49,,
285,0.97,2785.215,2790.687,"You froze up on me a little bit, Councilmember Mosqueda.",49,,
286,0.97,2790.754,2793.023,I was trying to filibuster!,49,,
287,0.97,2793.09,2805.769,I'll turn it over to you Councilmember Mosqueda to introduce this topic that is on the introduction and referral calendar for action in the future.,49,,
288,0.97,2805.836,2809.273,"With that being said, I'll go ahead and hand it over to you.",49,,
289,0.97,2809.339,2814.611,"Thank you so much, Council president and do let me know if I start to freeze again.",50,,
290,0.97,2814.678,2822.886,"Sorry about that, just as we were coming up to this agenda topic, zoom froze for me.",50,,
291,0.97,2822.953,2823.854,Thank you for Filibustering.,50,,
292,0.97,2823.921,2829.893,I want to provide some context to the bill and look for any text messages in case I start to freeze again.,50,,
293,0.97,2829.96,2843.073,"Colleagues I want to frame today's discussion in light of two headlines from this morning, the first is from NPR, the National public radio headline this morning talked about how App based drivers and service workers do not have any access to sick leave.",50,,
294,0.97,2843.14,2846.944,These are folks who are currently in harm's way right now.,50,,
295,0.97,2847.01,2859.423,"They are delivering our food and grocery stores, some of us may have family members who are working as drivers and our loved ones, neighbors and colleagues need have access to sick leave in light of Covid.",50,,
296,0.97,2859.489,2867.297,They also this morning talked about how this year's influenza is going to be even worse than past years.,50,,
297,0.97,2867.364,2872.302,"We have influenza coupled with Covid, they called it a very dark winter coming.",50,,
298,0.97,2872.369,2874.571,The second headline comes from democracy now.,50,,
299,0.97,2874.638,2882.379,"If folks listened to Amy good win, they would have listened to the headline talking about how this will be a call for leadership.",50,,
300,0.97,2882.446,2888.218,We need to have leadership in this time as the dark winter is coming and we don't have sick leave for all workers.,50,,
301,0.97,2888.285,2897.828,The bill in front of you provides a sick leave benefit to the very workers left out of the sick leave structure in the past.,50,,
302,0.97,2897.894,2901.498,"This legislation, I would pause it, answers the question where is the leadership.",50,,
303,0.97,2901.565,2903.267,Thank you to Karina bull for being on the line with us.,50,,
304,0.97,2903.333,2906.737,Thank you for all of your work.,50,,
305,0.97,2906.803,2932.829,"I want to thank them for working on the sick leave policy for almost since the very beginning of March and intense stake holder engagement with folks from not just the worker's side but also the App based delivery side and we have, I think, put together a piece of legislation as of last week that really meets any of the concerns and questions from the App-Based side and meets the goals and hopes from the worker's side.",50,,
306,0.97,2932.896,2939.636,This is truly a collaborative effort in front of you in terms of the introduction or referral calendar and the presentation we'll walk through.,50,,
307,0.97,2939.703,2952.983,"For a bit of background before I turn it over to Karina, Seattle passed and implemented the paid sick leave policy from employees from eight years ago in 2012.",50,,
308,0.97,2953.05,2966.163,"Simultaneously, they have increased by 15% with independent contractors representing about 16%.",50,,
309,0.97,2966.229,2970.3,--.,50,,
310,0.97,2970.367,2976.039,"Councilmember Mosqueda, you have frozen up on us.",51,,
311,0.97,2976.106,2977.541,There you are.,52,,
312,0.97,2977.607,2982.312,"Sorry, you froze up on us for about 30 seconds.",52,,
313,0.97,2982.379,2984.448,I wanted to make sure you were aware of that.,52,,
314,0.97,2984.514,2987.284,"Thank you, I'll continue.",53,,
315,0.97,2987.351,2994.291,Many of the workers who are independent contractor status don't have access to paid sick and safe leave.,53,,
316,0.97,2994.358,3002.599,Some of the Apps do offer sick and save leave but it should be noted that there are barriers to Accessing the sick leave.,53,,
317,0.97,3002.666,3013.844,"For the workers that we metered about this morning on the headlines that are out of sick and safe leave, we want to make sure that there is access to sick leave during the time of Covid.",53,,
318,0.97,3013.91,3029.76,We need to make sure that workers that have been deemed essential have access to sick leave and especially for folks who are interacting with Seattle restaurant owners and the general public to make sure everyone is safe.,53,,
319,0.97,3029.826,3030.927,Can you still hear me?,53,,
320,0.97,3030.994,3031.128,Okay.,53,,
321,0.97,3031.194,3031.728,I'm seeing thumbs up.,53,,
322,0.97,3031.795,3038.902,Not providing them with sick leave means that workers will be interacting with members of the public when they are sick.,53,,
323,0.97,3038.969,3042.539,That shouldn't be an option as we plot our road to recovery.,53,,
324,0.97,3042.606,3059.556,"Workers won't be able to take time off when they experience domestic violence, a critical element of the safe leave component and we also know that there has been a rise in domestic violence given the Covid situation which has created isolation for many families across this country.",53,,
325,0.97,3059.623,3065.395,Paid sick and safe leave is a vital protection for everyone that the city should have.,53,,
326,0.97,3065.462,3073.904,"It doesn't suffice to have higher wages, that many of the units have been able to negotiate $2 and hero pay or a hazard pay.",53,,
327,0.97,3073.97,3074.337,That is important.,53,,
328,0.97,3074.404,3085.582,"Vacation time and paid family leave is critically important but we have to make sure, especially when there is a public health crisis that paid sick and safe leave are available to every worker, including independent contractors.",53,,
329,0.97,3085.649,3088.452,I want to just share with you one piece to frame it up for Karina.,53,,
330,0.97,3088.518,3099.262,"I have had the opportunity to work on the policy over the last two months and share a little bit about a story from Carmen, a driver from grub Hub.",53,,
331,0.97,3099.329,3109.272,"She says now that people are hungry, and hiding within their homes from the virus, I'm suddenly essential, she says.",53,,
332,0.97,3109.339,3113.71,"I'm risking exposure to a highly contagious, possibly deadly virus, to fetch people dinner.",53,,
333,0.97,3113.777,3116.146,This is why we need sick leave.,53,,
334,0.97,3116.213,3128.558,"I was sick with the extreme flu symptoms in March, although extremely weak, constantly coughing and having trouble taking a full breath, I kept working as a delivery driver because it was my only source of income.",53,,
335,0.97,3128.625,3132.028,At times I was too weak to work or finish my shift.,53,,
336,0.97,3132.095,3135.932,I lost my opportunity to earn an income.,53,,
337,0.97,3135.999,3150.113,"Gig work is my only income so I am now behind on my monthly bills, I work as much as possible, but there are days when I only make enough to go on for the next day, put gas in the car and grab a few groceries.",53,,
338,0.97,3150.18,3153.75,I do not live paycheck to paycheck.,53,,
339,0.97,3153.817,3155.418,I do not live day-to-day.,53,,
340,0.97,3155.485,3156.086,I live order to order.,53,,
341,0.97,3156.152,3162.225,I do not know how I will financially recover.,53,,
342,0.97,3162.292,3163.894,I'm still experiencing waves of Covid symptoms.,53,,
343,0.97,3163.96,3166.229,At times I'm not able to work.,53,,
344,0.97,3166.296,3171.768,With the sick leave I would not have tried to work when I was so very sick and possibly spreading the virus.,53,,
345,0.97,3171.835,3174.538,"With sick leave, I would have stayed home.",53,,
346,0.97,3174.604,3177.607,"With sick leave, I may have recovered faster.",53,,
347,0.97,3177.674,3194.925,"So I leave that as a framing for why this conversation is so essential right now and perhaps I'll turn it over to Karina to walk us through the power point presentation, Council President, that she has provided to us.",53,,
348,0.97,3194.991,3198.461,Thank you so much for the introduction.,54,,
349,0.97,3198.528,3199.729,I think you have a presentation.,54,,
350,0.97,3199.796,3201.364,I imagine you'll share your screen with us.,54,,
351,0.97,3201.431,3201.932,Yes.,55,,
352,0.97,3201.998,3205.869,And walk us through the presentation.,56,,
353,0.97,3205.936,3207.604,So take it away.,56,,
354,0.97,3207.671,3209.105,Thank you so much.,57,,
355,0.97,3209.172,3211.541,"I'm Karina bull, I'm on Council central staff.",57,,
356,0.97,3211.608,3219.516,I'll take a few moments to share my screen.,57,,
357,0.97,3219.583,3224.888,"I just need to do, I believe, one more item.",57,,
358,0.97,3224.955,3229.459,So you don't see all of these notes.,57,,
359,0.97,3229.526,3232.062,"Karina, we don't see the notes right now, so you're fine.",58,,
360,0.97,3232.128,3237.367,Thank you for that feed back.,59,,
361,0.97,3237.434,3238.368,It looks great.,60,,
362,0.97,3238.435,3238.835,Okay.,61,,
363,0.97,3238.902,3258.622,"So as Councilmember Mosqueda introduced for everyone, this legislation at its heart seeks to require hiring entities, defined as food delivery network companies and transportation network companies to provide the gig workers working for them in Seattle with paid sick and safe time.",61,,
364,0.97,3258.688,3268.331,It would allow such workers to be able to care for their personal and family member's health conditions and safety needs.,61,,
365,0.97,3268.398,3274.371,This presentation today will take listeners and watchers through the main components of the legislation.,61,,
366,0.97,3274.437,3290.153,"There are a fair amount of them, but many of them will be familiar to people because as Councilmember noted, the paid sick and safe time has been in effect for eight years.",61,,
367,0.97,3290.22,3300.764,"This legislation was modelled on Psst, as it is called for employees, with some modifications to reflect the work experiences of gig workers.",61,,
368,0.97,3300.83,3309.673,"As a refresher, paid sick and safe time, again, pretty much the same for gig workers as it is for employees.",61,,
369,0.97,3309.739,3348.244,"It would allow a worker to use this paid leave for themselves or for a family member, for diagnosis care and preventive care and there is the very important safe time leave, which is able to be used to obtain services for domestic violence when a family member school is closed and when the hiring entity has reduced or discontinued operations for health and safety reason or has been shut down due to an order of a public official for a health emergency reason.",61,,
370,0.97,3348.311,3359.989,Coverage is food delivery network companies and transportation network companies with 250 or more gig workers worldwide.,61,,
371,0.97,3360.056,3373.369,It Aligns with the threshold for coverage for a tier 3 large employer under the paid sick and save time for employee's ordinance.,61,,
372,0.97,3373.436,3384.981,The gig workers are those who are working for the entities and being treated as independent contractors and so therefore have barriers to Accessing this paid leave.,61,,
373,0.97,3385.048,3389.486,Here you see the definitions or an excerpt of the definitions.,61,,
374,0.97,3389.552,3400.597,It is notable that the food delivery network company is for companies delivering from four distinct kinds of places.,61,,
375,0.97,3400.663,3415.879,"Those places are eating and drinking establishments, food processing establishments, grocery stores and then a facility that may or may not be open to the public there is a place where they can go for the items delivered to customers.",61,,
376,0.97,3415.945,3445.608,"This is not by any means an exhaustive list of the kind of companies that would be covered by this law, but some examples include Uber and Lyft for the TNC companies and then for food delivery network companies, Instacart, door dash, Postmates, grub Hub, Amazon fresh, just a sample of those but gives people an idea of who this would cover.",61,,
377,0.97,3445.675,3450.413,Gig workers are those working for the companies.,61,,
378,0.97,3450.48,3457.687,The payment for the Psst would be paid to a daily basis.,61,,
379,0.97,3457.754,3479.943,"It would be determined on what is an average daily compensation, the term developed for this legislation, and it would be a daily average of compensation that the gig worker had earned in the past and then that way, when they use this paid leave, they would be earning what they could have earned had they actually gone to work.",61,,
380,0.97,3480.009,3489.485,"That daily average compensation is compromised of what they were paid for providing services, bonuses, commissions, as well as tips.",61,,
381,0.97,3489.552,3513.843,"The daily average would be for the highest earning calendar months since October of 2019 or since the gig worker's commencement of work and then the amount would be recalculated every calendar month to reflect adjustments and earnings but always the would, er would be paid the highest calendar month of the time period.",61,,
382,0.97,3513.91,3520.183,"For accrual of sick and safe time, the accrual would be for a temporary period of time.",61,,
383,0.97,3520.25,3548.311,"It would be during the Covid-19 emergency and then six months there after to reflect subsequent waves or the fact that the economy would still be recovering during that time period and that people are still getting sick during that time period, so it would be the right to accrue and use paid sick and safe time until six months after the end of the Mayor's civil emergency or a concurrent civil emergency.",61,,
384,0.97,3548.378,3567.43,"What that would mean is that if the Mayor's civil emergency ended but the governor's state of emergency was still in effect, then accrual and use would end six months after the end of the later terminated emergency, which might be the governor's in that example.",61,,
385,0.97,3567.497,3574.37,Accrual would be different depending on when the gig worker started working for the hiring entity.,61,,
386,0.97,3574.437,3584.247,"For those who would begin working before the effected date, they would have two choices for how their gig workers would accrue.",61,,
387,0.97,3584.314,3617.313,"One of them would be accruing one day of paid sick and safe time for every 30 days worked beginning on October 9th of 2019 last year or instead of going backwards in time and figuring out Retro actively how much, looking at records to see how much each gig worker worked, the hiring entities could choose just to load up all gig worker's accounts with at least five days of paid sick and safe time and then from that time forward, they would accrue one day for every 30 days worked.",61,,
388,0.97,3617.38,3627.924,"The way this is drafted, it gives hiring entities a choice on how they want to begin accrual of paid sick and safe time when the ordinance goes into effect.",61,,
389,0.97,3627.991,3637.934,"For gig workers who begin work on or after the effective day of the ordinance, they would accrue one day of paid sick and safe time for every 30 days worked.",61,,
390,0.97,3638.001,3648.845,"Over the course of the year, if the gig worker is working five days a week, they would probably accrue somewhere around nine days of paid sick and safe time.",61,,
391,0.97,3648.911,3656.652,"If working every single day the year, they would accrue as much as 12 days of paid sick and safe time.",61,,
392,0.97,3656.719,3664.06,That lines up pretty well with the large employer for the employee's rate of accrual.,61,,
393,0.97,3664.127,3683.579,"An important piece to mention is that a gig worker's ability to accrue paid sick and safe time to figure out what the payment is going to be is all based on their work in Seattle, but the work is performed in part or in whole in Seattle.",61,,
394,0.97,3683.646,3704.934,"What that means is that any day that a worker has a delivery of a food item or shopping in Seattle or picks up a passenger in Seattle or drops off a passenger in Seattle, that is--that Conts as work in Seattle, even if it were five hours of the eight hour day and the three hours were elsewhere.",61,,
395,0.97,3705.001,3711.14,"The idea is that whenever there is a touch point in Seattle, that is going to trigger accrual of paid sick and safe time.",61,,
396,0.97,3711.207,3719.682,It is going to trigger the calculation for figuring out their average daily compensation.,61,,
397,0.97,3719.749,3725.321,The use of paid sick and safe time would be eligible for eligible workers upon their request.,61,,
398,0.97,3725.388,3755.184,"Eligibility is whether or not they have worked in Seattle within 90 calendar days before their request, as I mentioned, they need to use it in daily increments and similar to the paid sick and safe time for employees, hiring entities can ask for verification that the sick leave has been used for a legitimate reason after it has been used for more than three consecutive days.",61,,
399,0.97,3755.251,3775.872,"That verification notably cannot ask for a diagnosis or nature on the condition and the legislation does have a provision that mirrors the office of labor standards emergency room for paid sick and safe time, which is that during a public health emergency, hiring entities cannot require Healthcare provider's note.",61,,
400,0.97,3775.938,3786.582,Other requirements of the legislation are that hiring entities need to provide notification at least monthly of what the gig worker's average daily compensation rate is.,61,,
401,0.97,3786.649,3797.793,"How much paid and sick time they have available, carryover, having entities must permit gig works to carryover at least nine days to L following year.",61,,
402,0.97,3797.86,3807.57,"If a gig worker is not working for a period of 12 months or less, whether it is due to voluntary inactivity or Deactivation.",61,,
403,0.97,3807.637,3811.807,They have the right to retain all of their accrued paid sick and safe time.,61,,
404,0.97,3811.874,3817.68,All of the provisions are present in the existing paid sick and safe time ordinances as well.,61,,
405,0.97,3817.747,3831.861,"As is standard with all of the city of Seattle's labor standards, gig workers must be given a notice of their rights, hiring entities must keep records for three years and retaliation is prohibited.",61,,
406,0.97,3831.928,3835.398,Enforcement is by the office of labor standards.,61,,
407,0.97,3835.464,3855.017,"There would be a private rite of action and remedies could be unpaid compensation, three times that amount if the director decides that it is warranted with penalties Payability to the civil penalties and fines.",61,,
408,0.97,3855.084,3880.176,"Last, the duration this legislation is it would be add Mattly repealed without action by Council according to the dates we see for you whenever is terminated last or December 31st, 2023, which ever is latest.",61,,
409,0.97,3880.243,3884.847,"Three years after later terminated current emergency or December 31st, 2023.",61,,
410,0.97,3884.914,3895.758,The reason why the legislation is going out for three years beyond when the gig worker has the right to use and accrue the paid sick and safe time is because that time is needed.,61,,
411,0.97,3895.825,3918.414,Those three years are needed for the office of labor standards to be able to investigate claims of noncompliance and for the hiring entities to keep the record so that office of labor standards can conduct their investigations or perhaps could be a private right of action that needs to do discovery.,61,,
412,0.97,3918.481,3925.888,Next steps for the legislation are that Councilmembers can think about and request amendments this week up until Wednesday at noon.,61,,
413,0.97,3925.955,3933.496,"That is the request, and then next Monday there is an opportunity for full Council to vote on the legislation.",61,,
414,0.97,3933.562,3940.102,That is the end of the presentation.,61,,
415,0.97,3940.169,3941.671,Thanks for listening.,61,,
416,0.97,3941.737,3947.61,Thank you for the presentation.,62,,
417,0.97,3947.677,3953.115,"Colleagues, any questions or comments for either the prime sponsor or Karina?",62,,
418,0.97,3953.182,3958.621,"Council President, may I offer additional context?",63,,
419,0.97,3958.688,3958.921,Sure.,64,,
420,0.97,3958.988,3959.689,Thank you.,65,,
421,0.97,3959.755,3977.707,"I want to just say for folks, we have been working Deliberatively with many people in the community, as you saw on slides five on Karina's legislation, we engaged and received input from Postmates, door dash, Uber, Uber eats.",65,,
422,0.97,3977.773,3982.044,I want to thank them for their time.,65,,
423,0.97,3982.111,4011.607,"Also we have been involved in the same level of conversations with folks from the worker representation, from 117 in Washington, Mlk labor, Usc 21 and national level from center for popular democracy just want to thank the Mayor's office from the office of labor standards involved in all of the conversations since the very beginning, seven weeks ago.",65,,
424,0.97,4011.674,4020.015,We were thinking about introducing something at the beginning of March and for the last seven weeks we have been working to keep the Mayor's office involved in the conversations.,65,,
425,0.97,4020.082,4048.711,"When we approached them and told them we were talking about or thinking about sick leave, they said they would love for us to work on this while they work on parallel protections for gig workers and really, I think, understood how intricate the conversations were going to be and they have shown that the Deliberative conversations really led to this collaborative policy in front of us and just want to say thanks for walking us through that.",65,,
426,0.97,4048.778,4060.289,Our hope is that we get feed back from all of you by noon on Wednesday if you have amendments and always appreciate your feed back and thoughts.,65,,
427,0.97,4062.191,4062.425,.,65,,
428,0.97,4062.491,4063.459,"Great, thank you.",66,,
429,0.97,4063.526,4066.228,Thank you for the additional information.,66,,
430,0.97,4066.295,4074.27,"I see Councilmember Pedersen has raised his hand and again, colleagues for those of you who are on zoom via the Video chat function.",66,,
431,0.97,4074.336,4083.779,"If you can raise your hand and let me know if you have any questions for those of you on the phone, who I think is just Councilmember Juarez.",66,,
432,0.97,4083.846,4089.652,"If you have a question, send me a message to let you know.",66,,
433,0.97,4089.718,4091.554,"Councilmember Pedersen, the floor is yours.",66,,
434,0.97,4091.62,4092.087,Thank you.,67,,
435,0.97,4092.154,4099.862,"Good morning, colleagues and thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda, for introducing this.",67,,
436,0.97,4099.929,4114.043,"It is impressive how much due diligence that has been done with the Stakeholders, business labor, Mayor's office who have implemented from the executive side and really excellent presentation from Council of central staff this morning.",67,,
437,0.97,4114.109,4125.087,My question is about having an additional week it is relatively complex piece of legislation.,67,,
438,0.97,4125.154,4130.192,I didn't know if you could either give us an additional week to look at it.,67,,
439,0.97,4130.259,4147.51,"You're asking for amendments in 48 hours essentially and just trying to, you know, manage how we have additional time to review this so that our staff isn't working through the night, reviewing it.",67,,
440,0.97,4147.576,4149.078,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",68,,
441,0.97,4149.144,4155.251,I will comment on the Timeline and I'm not sure if others have got that as well.,68,,
442,0.97,4155.317,4157.887,We did this on the introduction and referral calendar on Friday.,68,,
443,0.97,4157.953,4163.092,"It has had the chance to have full--to be on the official list, so we're not walking anything on today.",68,,
444,0.97,4163.158,4166.629,Just want to make sure folks know that.,68,,
445,0.97,4166.695,4181.51,"Second, we definitely would love your feed back and I think our intention was really to have tried to introduce this one or two weeks ago but given the Intricastes of it, wanted to make sure we have all of the questions answered.",68,,
446,0.97,4181.577,4187.416,"We have Karina, policy experts, in case your staff wanted additional walking through the details.",68,,
447,0.97,4187.483,4193.422,"If the Wednesday noon deadline is not workable for your office and you want to have more conversations, happy to do so.",68,,
448,0.97,4193.489,4238.801,"At this point, our hope would be to move this forward with the Council President's approval for next Monday's full council vote with the recognition that we're already now, you know, two and a half months into this crisis and as you heard the story of Carmen, folks are making these impossible decisions about losing wages or going to work sick and when the economy starts to open up a little bit more as early as next week, I think we'll see a spike in the numbers projected before they go back down again, cross your fingers, and I really want to do everything we can to get the policy out there, but you know, our office is definitely interested in answering any of the questions that you have with the hope that we can do this by next Monday.",68,,
449,0.97,4238.867,4246.075,So I appreciate that this is a complex set of laws.,69,,
450,0.97,4246.141,4256.118,I really do appreciate that Councilmember Mosqueda and her staff and Council central staff spent quite a bit of time working through some of the issues.,69,,
451,0.97,4256.185,4275.638,"I also appreciate that we're all working remotely, so I'll just say that I think in my conversations with Councilmember Mosqueda's office, you know, we understand that they have a very strong interest in having full council action on this next Monday.",69,,
452,0.97,4275.704,4291.42,"I think that it is a very dense bill and so having, you know, spent a little bit of time with it over the weekend and can understand that there may be some Councilmembers who may want more time.",69,,
453,0.97,4291.487,4320.015,"My suggestion would be that we continue to aim for final Council action on this upcoming Monday but I think depending on how many amendments and questions we see from you colleagues, then I think there could be an opportunity to, in conversation with the prime sponsor, discuss whether we need a little bit more time to work through some of the issues.",69,,
454,0.97,4320.082,4343.172,"We certainly appreciate that there is a sense of urgency around making sure that folks have access to these benefits, but we also want to make sure we have a quality piece of legislation and I don't think anybody is suggesting we sacrifice or compromise on quality for the sake of expediency.",69,,
455,0.97,4343.238,4360.956,"Let's see how this work goes in terms of questions and potential mandatory work and I'll stay in close contact with Karina from Council central staff and with the prime sponsor, Councilmember Mosqueda to see if we need to adjust based on the volume of response that we get from you all.",69,,
456,0.97,4361.023,4370.899,This conversation today was intended to be sort of a first conversation to make sure that you colleagues were all paying attention to this particular bill.,69,,
457,0.97,4370.966,4382.077,It is an important bill that is directly responsive to the Covid-19 crisis as it relates to the segment of workers and because we all know it is a complex issue.,69,,
458,0.97,4382.144,4391.019,"We want to make sure, we wanted to make sure you all had an opportunity to begin that public conversation now.",69,,
459,0.97,4391.086,4395.691,"Councilmember Mosqueda, I know I haven't had an opportunity to talk to you about that particular approach.",69,,
460,0.97,4395.758,4407.002,"You know, please, I'll hand it over to you to see if you are amenable to having that little bit of flexibility that week.",69,,
461,0.97,4407.069,4408.771,"Thank you, Council President.",70,,
462,0.97,4408.837,4414.143,I want to reiterate our office is very interested in working with everybody who has any questions.,70,,
463,0.97,4414.209,4424.82,I know Karina is steeped in the policy details given we tried to mirror as much as we could off of the existing paid sick and safe time leave law.,70,,
464,0.97,4424.887,4432.261,We tried to think really creatively with workers and those platforms on how sick leave could be applied.,70,,
465,0.97,4432.327,4466.061,"Helpful, it is helpful if we can talk about that background One-On-One with the various offices, and Karina, I know, she is very available and I want to thank her for her due diligence to be working with us over the last several weeks, if you have questions that can't get answered, our intent is to pass this with as many questions answered and the draft that your office has received as well as on Thursday it was on the Inr calendar on Friday and due hope that over the next few days we get the chance to answer any questions that folks have.",70,,
466,0.97,4466.128,4474.636,"We can be flexible on that Wednesday deadline with the goal of trying to share any amendments with the Council colleagues, that is what the deadline was for.",70,,
467,0.97,4474.703,4487.082,"Council President, if it doesn't seem like we can get there and need to wait another week, we can do at your direction and with that, I do hope folks reach out to us and to Karina to answer any questions.",70,,
468,0.97,4487.149,4490.452,Hopefully we can get this passed on Monday.,70,,
469,0.97,4490.519,4506.635,"I would just, again, I completely understand the sense of urgency around this and so I don't want to suggest that we derail or unnecessarily derail the Timeline because I know there has been a lot of background work on the issue already.",71,,
470,0.97,4506.702,4526.555,"So I do want to sort of just be sensitive to the fact that we are working under very different circumstances and this is an important and significant work of protection bill and want to make sure that the quality, high quality is maintained which I believe it will be.",71,,
471,0.97,4526.622,4566.628,"I want to encourage you all colleagues to pay a little bit more attention to this bill this week and get it through and I will say that I have received requests from at least two colleagues, Councilmember Mosqueda, for an additional week to be able to thoroughly review the bill so I think there is some work that needs to be done here to make sure that folks feel comfortable with the contents and that they have their questions answered.",71,,
472,0.97,4566.695,4570.432,"Happy to connect to you Offline, Councilmember Mosqueda.",71,,
473,0.97,4570.499,4573.702,I think I saw Councilmember Sawant raise their hand.,71,,
474,0.97,4573.769,4574.636,Okay.,71,,
475,0.97,4574.703,4580.742,"So Councilmember Sawant, we'll hand it over to you.",71,,
476,0.97,4580.809,4581.376,Thank you.,72,,
477,0.97,4581.443,4597.459,"We strongly support this legislation and we are really interested to figure out how we can make this permanent, absolutely gig economy workers should be included in paid sick and safe time and the paid sick and safe time should be strengthened further.",72,,
478,0.97,4597.526,4617.746,"Right now my question was specifically if Karina could go a little bit more on how the enforcement of this bill could work, because you know Uber, for example, as a corporation, has just as an example, refused to follow Seattle's labor laws in the past.",72,,
479,0.97,4617.813,4638.9,"I mean, just flat out has refused to let itself be accountable and the city has failed to enforce them, like sharing the Union rights and so on, and we know that enforcement of labor laws is as important of a piece as establishing the law in the first place.",72,,
480,0.97,4638.967,4671.266,We know how crucial that is I was wondering if you could go into that a little bit more and then I just wanted to also say for the record this is a good example of why we cannot have--any cuts or hiring freezes to the office of labor standards directly result in a detrimental effect to workers because the enforcement is important for workers actually to be guaranteed the law.,72,,
481,0.97,4671.333,4683.779,"For enforcement, I'll begin by saying this legislation reflects the standard enforcement authorizations and procedures of the office of labor standards, which is part of the reason why it is such a long piece of legislation.",73,,
482,0.97,4683.845,4698.894,I think there are 18 or 20 pages which are just devoted to legislation and so office of labor standards would be equipped to have all of their tools at their disposal in order to enforce the legislation.,73,,
483,0.97,4698.96,4720.916,Including the ability to develop and issue rules and this legislation does have language added to it to reflect that rules would need to be issued quickly and so office of labor standards is given the authority to identify existing rules that might already be in the book for paid sick and safe time.,73,,
484,0.97,4720.982,4732.761,It went through extensive stake holder process eight years ago and less than two years ago when the legislation was amended to reflect the State-Wide standards as well.,73,,
485,0.97,4732.828,4741.603,That will enable us to be nimble and quickly be able to do outreach for the law and begin enforcing it as well.,73,,
486,0.97,4741.67,4774.402,"The office, this legislation also has a provision in it that allows the director of office of labor standards to designate a daily penalty or daily amount of unpaid compensation in the event that in the course of an investigation the respondent, the hiring entity is not providing records in a timely basis or maybe the respondent provides so much records that the office of labor standards cannot analyze in an efficient, quick manner.",73,,
487,0.97,4774.469,4795.423,"If that were to happen and they could not determine the precise amount owed, the office of labor standards has the authority to say that every worker would get $150, that it would be the automatic assumed rate of compensation that would be owed to the workers and the director could just say that is how much is owed.",73,,
488,0.97,4795.49,4814.009,"I imagine that the office might also be going over the existing rules saying it is estimated that workers use an average of 30 hours or so, translated to today's paid sick or safe time.",73,,
489,0.97,4814.075,4816.711,They could apply $150 toward the number of days a year.,73,,
490,0.97,4816.778,4829.858,That would enable the office of labor standards to make the assessments quickly and efficiently to get money to workers sooner and so use less of the resources as well.,73,,
491,0.97,4829.925,4832.761,Do you have a follow up?,74,,
492,0.97,4832.827,4833.795,I do.,75,,
493,0.97,4833.862,4834.663,Please.,76,,
494,0.97,4834.729,4837.499,"Thank you, president Gonzalez.",77,,
495,0.97,4837.566,4839.201,Thank you for your response.,77,,
496,0.97,4839.267,4840.569,I really appreciate that.,77,,
497,0.97,4840.635,4858.22,"I do have a specific follow up, not so much related to the legislation under the discussion right now, but about some of the things you said about how easily or how effectively the office of labor standards can carry out enforcement.",77,,
498,0.97,4858.286,4868.263,"I would, I would look forward to an ongoing discussion with the executive and with the office of labor standards on this and my staff will follow up with you on this.",77,,
499,0.97,4868.33,4878.073,"I have already asked them to do this, but my concern is, you used the word nimble.",77,,
500,0.97,4878.139,4899.194,"I'm extremely concerned that, I mean, if we are not to have sort of a pure fantasy about being nimble and if you're actually going to do this, I think we are in a very difficult situation because the office of labor standards enforcement office is currently under staffed with open positions and hiring freeze.",77,,
501,0.97,4899.261,4911.339,"Right now workers filing complaints can expect a six month delay before their cases can be heard, so it is a concrete question, how can we do enforcement when we don't have the staff to do it?",77,,
502,0.97,4911.406,4927.222,I would appreciate maybe a follow up conversation just about that aspect of it in the future and just also a note to the city council that maybe you should discuss that as well.,77,,
503,0.97,4927.289,4927.689,"Great, thank you.",78,,
504,0.97,4927.756,4928.089,I'm sorry.,78,,
505,0.97,4928.156,4932.427,I didn't mean to interrupt you.,78,,
506,0.97,4932.494,4932.627,No.,79,,
507,0.97,4932.694,4932.794,No.,79,,
508,0.97,4932.861,4933.094,You didn't.,79,,
509,0.97,4933.161,4935.563,I was thinking Karina would say something in response.,79,,
510,0.97,4935.63,4936.064,That is fine.,79,,
511,0.97,4936.131,4937.766,We can have a discussion.,79,,
512,0.97,4937.832,4942.37,I think it is a concrete credit how would they enforce it.,79,,
513,0.97,4942.437,4963.458,"So what I will say is that, recognizing everything that you have just said is that this legislation gives the office of labor standards all of the tools that they Legislatively need in order to be efficient and quick with this legislation.",80,,
514,0.97,4963.525,4968.463,That is in addition to whatever other resources they might need.,80,,
515,0.97,4968.53,4973.468,This law does more to assist them in that effort than other existing laws do.,80,,
516,0.97,4973.535,4987.282,So I just wanted to point out that this law was drafted in such a way that recognizes that Ols uses as much support under the law in order to enforce this legislation.,80,,
517,0.97,4987.349,4998.827,"Karina, I have a quick question around, that sort of Dove-Tails from the issue that Councilmember Sawant just flagged around enforcement.",81,,
518,0.97,4998.893,5039.3,"I think Councilmember Sawant's points sort of around the broader issue of how do we enforcement with at least some of the companies that will be covered by this, who have historically not been very forth right with anything related to the business model, but I think my question is, and I see appreciate that particular concern because I think it is a real practical issue in terms of implementation, but the other thing that I have related to that is I guess a little bit more process oriented.",81,,
519,0.97,5039.367,5053.548,"You mentioned in your presentation that the director's rules will be issued as it relates to--of this particular law, I think that is on page 12, line 18 of the legislation.",81,,
520,0.97,5053.615,5058.82,And you also mentioned that it is expected that it would become quickly.,81,,
521,0.97,5058.887,5078.273,I want a better sense of what quickly means and what conversations have been had with the office of labor standards related to the capacity and ability to be able to implement rule making quickly.,81,,
522,0.97,5078.339,5089.851,"Yeah, well, I certainly won't propose to answer on behalf of the office of labor standards, but what I will say is that they were very active in the development of this law.",82,,
523,0.97,5089.918,5106.634,"They did voice the need for the legislation to support them when this law goes into effect and so for that reason, where as typically legislation might not define as many terms as this legislation does.",82,,
524,0.97,5106.701,5113.675,This legislation defines things in the law that might otherwise be left to rules and so Ols contributed to that process.,82,,
525,0.97,5113.741,5130.625,So that is one way that rules can happen on a faster Timeline than as if the typical way for labor standards is that there is a vast array of terms that would need to be defined.,82,,
526,0.97,5130.692,5164.459,"And then also on page 12, the reference to the director rules, again gives Ols the ability, should they choose to use it, to reference already existing rules for this legislation and that delegation would have the force of law and so they could do that through issuing a rule that says that the paid sick and safe time rules, Chapter 70 apply to the gig worker legislation or they could do it as simply as a question and answer guidance for hiring entities and workers as well.",82,,
527,0.97,5164.526,5182.443,"So these are tools put into place to support office of labor standards, recognizing that they don't have as--that the capacity is limited in this situation right now.",82,,
528,0.97,5182.51,5182.71,Okay.,83,,
529,0.97,5182.777,5198.326,"So it doesn't sound like, so it sounds like we are, we are trying to resolve some of the time realities and capacity realities of Ols.",83,,
530,0.97,5198.393,5213.608,"Ols's rule making process by not leaving as much as we ordinarily would to the rule making process, but that still leaves some things in the ordinance that would still be subjected to rule making, right?",83,,
531,0.97,5213.675,5219.547,There will be some things that Ols would want to look at and define separately.,84,,
532,0.97,5219.614,5223.618,They haven't been addressed in the paid sick and safe time rules for employees.,84,,
533,0.97,5223.685,5233.294,"That could be the case and to the greatest extent possible, the draft is trying to bypass the need for that.",84,,
534,0.97,5233.361,5236.798,There may be issued that arise later on.,84,,
535,0.97,5236.864,5252.013,"Again, want to emphasize that the ability for the director to designate that daily amount, $150 a day, which is a little bit more than minimum wage times eight hours.",84,,
536,0.97,5252.08,5276.871,That was added to the legislation in order to allow Ols to issue a determination quickly and not haul them through the process of the back and forth of asking for records maybe are being delayed or Wading through records that are very overwhelming due to the organization or lack of organization or the here is volume of those records.,84,,
537,0.97,5276.938,5285.747,Does the director have to issue rules before enforcement begins and before this law goes into effect?,85,,
538,0.97,5285.813,5297.258,"Or is the ordinance drafted in such a way that the director has discretion to implement rules as we go along, sort of more, if you will.",85,,
539,0.97,5297.325,5299.293,Thank you for that question.,86,,
540,0.97,5299.36,5304.666,So the legislation is drafted where the director has discretion to issue those rules.,86,,
541,0.97,5304.732,5309.904,The implementation of the legislation is not conditions upon issuance of the rules.,86,,
542,0.97,5309.971,5331.793,So that is an important component of the law and then also the office of labor standards called chapter 140 that is something that they could reference for how their investigation process unfolds and how they collect information and interact with workers and with hiring entities.,86,,
543,0.97,5355.85,5358.019,Talking about sexual assault.,87,,
544,0.97,5358.086,5389.884,"When we had conversations Off- line, Karina, I had a specific question around how this law sort of Dovetails with confirmed, deactivated cases as a result of allegations and the language in the ordinance isn't super clear to me so I wanted to have you point me to the language that you indicated and address.",87,,
545,0.97,5389.951,5390.351,The issue.,87,,
546,0.97,5390.418,5390.718,Specifically.,87,,
547,0.97,5390.785,5444.972,"Earlier we discussed that workers are allowed to be used, paid sick and safe time when they are deactivated which is an important feature of this proposed legislation because at some time if the worker is requesting a pandemic assistance from their hiring entity because of Covid related reasons that hiring entity could automatically Deactivate them out of concerns about Covid before receiving confirmation that they have Covid, maybe a family member has Covid but in those situations while they are waiting to hear from the hiring entity if they qualify for the hiring entities pandemic assistance, which they may not, depending on the verification that they are or not able to provide, those situations and other situations with they are deactivated the worker would be able to use this paid leave.",88,,
548,0.97,5445.039,5446.174,This paid sick and safe time.,88,,
549,0.97,5446.24,5479.14,"And so, in the very original thoughts about this legislation it mirrored the transportation network company Deactivation rights ordinance which said, which allowed TNC to immediately Deactivate drivers without the two weeks notice in situations where there were allegations of egregious misconduct including at a minimum allegations of sexual assault.",88,,
550,0.97,5479.207,5502.463,"So, in the initial days of this drafting, that requirement was taken over to paid sick and safe time so if the driver had been alleged of egregious misconduct and was deactivated because of that they wouldn't have the right to use paid sick and safe time if they had been deactivated in those situations.",88,,
551,0.97,5502.53,5542.637,"And then upon further reflection and hearing from office of labor standards having the capacity to develop rules about what types of conduct would rise to the level of egregious in those situations that they might not have capacity to do that on a fast Timeline and thinking about also, that component was added in the other legislation as a safety concern, not wanting to have drivers driving when they had been alleged to have done something like sexual assault which is different than Accessing paid sick and safe time.",88,,
552,0.97,5542.703,5558.286,"So in consideration of those two things, the different type of safety concerns, the drivers wouldn't be driving, they would be Accessing paid leave and also the fact of Ols capacity to do Rulemaking, that provision was lifted out from this draft.",88,,
553,0.97,5558.352,5559.453,Or for this proposal.,88,,
554,0.97,5559.52,5562.556,Okay.,89,,
555,0.97,5562.623,5569.463,I want to think a little bit more from a policy perspective.,89,,
556,0.97,5569.53,5585.613,"It doesn't seem appropriate for me to effectively a driver who was verified, who had been deactivated on a verified allegation of sexual assault to get paid.",89,,
557,0.97,5585.68,5586.747,To be on leave.,89,,
558,0.97,5586.814,5600.828,After being sort of reasonably accused and confirmed that the Deactivation was in fact because of that type of egregious behavior.,89,,
559,0.97,5600.895,5616.377,"So, from a policy perspective, that feels wrong to me, but I want to get a better understanding of how this would work in this space.",89,,
560,0.97,5616.444,5638.632,"I just feel really strongly that if there is a verified case of Deactivation based on sexual assault allegations I'm not sure that it would be appropriate to, nonetheless, allow access to paid sick and safe time.",89,,
561,0.97,5638.699,5642.97,"So, to be clear, the original draft didn't say verified.",90,,
562,0.97,5643.037,5652.713,"So, the different ways of looking at it and so, if there is interest in changing that, the original draft said allegation.",90,,
563,0.97,5652.78,5663.724,And so if it has been verified in some way that would be a different situation than what was contemplated.,90,,
564,0.97,5663.791,5668.996,I will be happy to chat with you and the prime sponsor a little bit more.,91,,
565,0.97,5669.063,5673.467,I think this is an important potential distinction.,91,,
566,0.97,5673.534,5675.302,Yes.,92,,
567,0.97,5675.369,5677.738,Thank you for that.,92,,
568,0.97,5677.805,5680.307,Any other questions?,93,,
569,0.97,5680.374,5681.375,Cost member Mosqueda?,93,,
570,0.97,5681.442,5696.19,"Thank you, I can tell that we have been steeped in this bill for the last seven weeks and while I might feel like we have all these answers I've the folks like you and others have raised questions.",94,,
571,0.97,5696.257,5718.579,"I know Councilmember Herbold probably has something, you have a pondering look, as well, I will go ahead and put that question to rest that you asked Councilmember Pederson and welcome an extra week of folks want to walk through additional questions.",94,,
572,0.97,5718.646,5724.051,This is an important policy and folks know the INS and out and as you can tell it is a detailed piece of legislation in front of you.,94,,
573,0.97,5724.118,5735.863,"I know you have shared that sense of urgency, every single one of you, and I appreciate the ask and request, Council President, I wanted to follow up with you on that so there's not something hanging over for next week.",94,,
574,0.97,5735.93,5738.265,I appreciate your flexibility.,95,,
575,0.97,5738.332,5744.972,I have a request from at least two Council members for a little bit more time.,95,,
576,0.97,5745.039,5767.094,"The bill, I don't think it's the Pharisee motivated, extension request, I think it is just a desire to want to make sure that the policy is well understood and some of these more complex questions are able to be answered and drafted in time and reviewed in time under our enhanced review process.",95,,
577,0.97,5767.161,5767.728,Under proclamation 20-28.,95,,
578,0.97,5767.795,5771.599,So that we have a good sense of how we will move this Overarching policy forward.,95,,
579,0.97,5771.665,5777.471,"I just saw Council member Herbold Racer hand, the floor is yours.",95,,
580,0.97,5777.538,5780.107,You are on mute.,95,,
581,0.97,5780.174,5796.157,This question I have has been triggered by this particular piece of legislation but I suppose it could be a question for other bills as well tat have financial impacts.,96,,
582,0.97,5796.223,5832.56,"So, we have our standard fiscal note, and under normal circumstances the focus on financial impact to the city and looking into future budget years is not so much a problem because often we pass laws and its midyear and there is flexibility in the Department budget to pay for and limitation and enforcement activities that may not be budgeted within the current fiscal year.",96,,
583,0.97,5832.626,5860.955,"In this instance, when answering the question, does legislation have other impacts to the city of Seattle that are not reflected in the above, the answer is yes, this legislation would establish an invitation and enforcement rule for Ols, additional resources to support these activities may need to be considered in the 2021 proposed budget in the future budget Liberations.",96,,
584,0.97,5861.021,5880.874,"I really want to flag that I have been seeking with the help of counsel central staff, additional information, from the city budget office, about the departmental Submittals for midyear budget cuts.",96,,
585,0.97,5880.941,5888.916,Legislation that the Council is acting on now I think really underscores the need for that information.,96,,
586,0.97,5888.983,5895.055,"Council members are correct, we don't want austerity budgeting.",96,,
587,0.97,5895.122,5905.699,We don't want to tie the hands of the important departments like the office of labor standard by not adequately funding them.,96,,
588,0.97,5905.766,5915.242,Enforcing these new laws that we are passing to address the immediate health impacts of the Covid-19 crisis.,96,,
589,0.97,5915.309,5946.707,"Likewise, the city Department of construction inspection and their role in enforcing tenant laws, so, I think it is important that we think of this fiscal NOTE as a tool to find out what the costs are associated with implementing and enforcing emergency legislation and I don't think it is sufficient to simply say that we need to calm me to consider additional resources and 2021.",96,,
590,0.97,5946.774,5993.387,"If we're making considerations about making cuts to budgets this year we need to know, I believe, what the fiscal impacts of the bills that we are passing now for this year are and so I would request that central staff work with CBO in getting and continuing to get the information that I have requested as a relates to the individual Submittals for cuts as well as, as long as we are in this place of passing emergency legislation that is effective immediate, getting additional information about the financial impacts to the legislation in this budget year, in the 2020 budget year.",96,,
591,0.97,5993.454,5993.821,Thank you.,96,,
592,0.97,5993.887,6043.237,"Thank you for those comments and I do want, if Council member Mosqueda, you, as the chair of the committee, have any immediate response to counsel member Herbold, I offer you the opportunity to make that response now but I know that you, cut a member Mosqueda as the chair of the committee have been engaged in a lot of pack on conversations, both with counsel suffers staff and the city budget office around this year's budgeting process and I do want to be respectful of your role in that area and provide you the opportunity to respond if you are, if you have a response.",97,,
593,0.97,6043.303,6045.205,My only responses I think the concerns are shared.,98,,
594,0.97,6045.272,6047.04,We are be reached at getting that detailed information.,98,,
595,0.97,6047.107,6063.857,"I've made similar requests to the executive and are working through another process, hopefully with central staff, to be able to get information in real time, especially as we hear about supplemental budgets and I know there are potential cuts on the way that are being proposed.",98,,
596,0.97,6063.924,6064.892,Not being implemented necessarily.,98,,
597,0.97,6064.958,6072.199,We want to know the background details so the concerns are something that we have raised as well.,98,,
598,0.97,6072.266,6082.142,I know that is not necessarily related to this bill but perhaps we could weigh in on this.,98,,
599,0.97,6082.209,6084.378,"This is something, Council President, that you have raised as well.",98,,
600,0.97,6084.445,6085.612,We are in the same bucket.,98,,
601,0.97,6085.679,6093.921,Wanting and asking and creating structures to ensure that we get that type of information in advance.,98,,

603,0.97,6095.456,6105.666,"Colleagues, any other questions or comments on this particular bill?",99,,
604,0.97,6105.732,6108.035,Okay.,99,,
605,0.97,6108.101,6110.37,It looks like we have exhausted questions.,99,,
606,0.97,6110.437,6124.518,Let me double check my phone to make sure . It looks like nobody else has Pinged me asking for an opportunity to ask questions.,99,,
607,0.97,6124.585,6126.854,It does look like we have exhausted the questions.,99,,
608,0.97,6126.92,6142.069,"I am going to go ahead and thank Karina for being with us this morning and for your work with counsel member Mosqueda on this bill and Councilmember Mosqueda, unless you have closing remarks I will move us along.",99,,

626,0.97,6288.181,6289.75,A few announcements I would like to make.,100,,
627,0.97,6289.816,6299.092,"Just a reminder, folks, very likely have read recently that there is a new public health directive to begin wearing face coverings today.",100,,
628,0.97,6299.159,6304.931,You can find more information at King County.Gov for more information.,100,,
629,0.97,6304.998,6314.541,The guidance is that people wear masks inside and outside in places where social distancing is difficult.,100,,
630,0.97,6314.608,6322.849,"You can actually find directions to make face masks at home, at the King County Website, King County.Gov/Masks.",100,,
631,0.97,6322.916,6328.755,"And these directions are helpful for people who don't have the ability to so, as well.",100,,
632,0.97,6328.822,6339.766,"One important point to make, people who have flexibility or who would be in danger from where the face mask are not required to wear them.",100,,
633,0.97,6339.833,6350.077,And public health has been very clear that as a relates to enforcement we are not asking the public to police the neighbors.,100,,
634,0.97,6350.143,6355.182,We are just asking each person to wear a mask if they are able to protect each other.,100,,
635,0.97,6355.248,6392.919,And I think it is really important to note that so many of the public health orders that have come down since March our public health orders that have been effective and successful because of our shared appreciation for the health Vulnerabilities of our labors and desire to care for one another and I believe that we will see high compliance in King County for this new public health order for wearing masks.,100,,
636,0.97,6392.986,6396.556,Precisely because we do care about our neighbors.,100,,
637,0.97,6396.623,6413.874,"Other items coming up today, last Thursday, there was a letter circulated in support of a Federal build grant for the East marginal project . My office circulated this letter last Thursday.",100,,
638,0.97,6413.94,6418.111,With the hopes that we can get signatures on the letter today.,100,,
639,0.97,6418.178,6425.352,The Council signed a very similar letter in February for a separate Federal grant.,100,,
640,0.97,6425.418,6436.596,The interest that I happen this project is that it is a critical connection for bike commuters from West Seattle to ensure that they are separated from traffic.,100,,
641,0.97,6436.663,6443.136,"With the closure of the West Seattle bridge at least the end of 2021, you will be important.",100,,
642,0.97,6443.203,6447.374,As freight uses the lower bridge to West Seattle as well.,100,,
643,0.97,6447.44,6455.081,The project itself will incorporate safety and reliability in the movement of people and goods in this industrial area.,100,,
644,0.97,6455.148,6470.33,It also will support freight loads and promote efficiency through signal modifications and intelligent been transportation systems and improve safety by better separating Nonmotorized modes from freight traffic.,100,,
645,0.97,6470.397,6472.966,The grant application is for $20.,100,,
646,0.97,6473.033,6481.107,The AZTEC capital improvement program listing indicated that they Woud have approaches for full and.,100,,
647,0.97,6481.174,6489.482,Earlier Federal grant application was for $30 million and the port of Seattle is also contributing $5 million to the project.,100,,
648,0.97,6489.549,6493.887,I hope you will join me in signing this letter today at full council.,100,,
649,0.97,6493.954,6502.629,As far as things that came up last week I participated on Thursday in a Webinar with the Mayor for West Seattle.,100,,
650,0.97,6502.696,6516.042,As you can imagine there was a lot of interest in the progress around efforts surrounding the West Seattle bridge closer.,100,,
651,0.97,6516.109,6525.986,"But we covered a lot of topics as well, focused on the city's response to Covid-19 crisis.",100,,
652,0.97,6526.052,6530.257,"I will be having office hours on Friday, may 29, between 3:00 and 6:00 P.M.",100,,
653,0.97,6530.323,6538.131,You can Email to sign up.,100,,
654,0.97,6538.198,6551.978,"Of course, consistent with the Covid-19 open meetings Act and stay at home requirements, we will be holding these office hours virtually.",100,,
655,0.97,6552.045,6566.626,"Finally I want to highlight there is some really useful coverage in ""the Seattle times"" today regarding the modes of failure memo released by Estar recently.",100,,
656,0.97,6566.693,6584.477,"The conceptual modes of failure memo has been prepared by Ws P the structural consultant, it uses an analysis and modeling to determine how the High-Rise bridge could deteriorate should it reach failure.",100,,
657,0.97,6584.544,6586.713,It is not a prediction for failure.,100,,
658,0.97,6586.78,6611.705,"As.Does not believe that it is a Science-Based or data informed approach to try to predict the odds for if and when the scenarios discussed in the memo might occur, they don't believe that it is actually possible given the science that is out there.",100,,
659,0.97,6611.771,6620.113,The goal of the analysis is to identify all the possibilities and by identifying all the possibilities that allows us to prepare for those possibilities.,100,,
660,0.97,6620.18,6639.733,"The memo itself helps, even though it was only released last week, the earlier draft versions of the memo were used to inform Sdot's emergency response plan that was released a couple weeks ago now.",100,,
661,0.97,6639.799,6659.619,And it uses modeling of potential cracking scenarios in order to define parameters of a fall zone as well as build an additional buffer in all directions to really maximize the area in which we are preparing for safety.,100,,
662,0.97,6659.686,6672.032,There are a number of steps to prepare for an even more importantly prevent the Worst- case scenarios.,100,,
663,0.97,6672.098,6675.668,Sdot has been working diligently on those nine steps.,100,,
664,0.97,6675.735,6678.138,I will leave it there.,100,,
665,0.97,6678.204,6683.443,It is really helpful and good information to have.,100,,
666,0.97,6683.51,6706.966,As a relates specifically to what we are focused on right now . I want to highlight that one of the nine items is to repair the bearings at Pier 18 and a reminder that last month Sdot used emergency authority to Fast-Track the selection of a contractor in order to do that work.,100,,
667,0.97,6707.033,6728.621,We don't know yet whether or not it will be possible to fully repair the bridge but the work that Sdot and the design team are doing now allows us to ensure that we are preserving the integrity of the bridge to the highest possible extent to keep all viable options open.,100,,
668,0.97,6728.688,6731.791,I'm done.,100,,
669,0.97,6731.858,6741.301,"Thank you, any questions or comments on Councilmember Herbold's report?",101,,
670,0.97,6741.367,6742.735,"Okay, I am not seeing or hearing any.",101,,
671,0.97,6742.802,6744.37,We will go ahead and move along.,101,,
672,0.97,6744.437,6746.372,Next up is Council member warrants.,101,,
673,0.97,6746.439,6747.807,Can you hear me?,102,,

677,0.97,6770.396,6787.013,"So, Collies, last Friday I circulated letter of support for the--the Cheyenne River Sioux, you should have a copy of that letter in front of you, I know it is been posted.",104,,
678,0.97,6787.08,6788.047,The letter is dated today.,104,,
679,0.97,6788.114,6803.863,In the letter as is noted on May 8 the governor of South Dakota issued a demand that tribal leaders must remove security checkpoints that they had set up to prevent the spread of Covid-19.,104,,
680,0.97,6803.93,6819.746,Members of the tribe have all issued statements declaring the highway road checkpoints may have led for travelers in response to a growing concern over the past nature of this virus.,104,,
681,0.97,6819.812,6825.151,Currently there are no plans by the three nations to take these checkpoints down.,104,,

828,0.97,8083.408,8098.59,And finally I want to know what resources are being used to ensure that the teams are following CDC guidance for dispersing homeless neighbors if there are individual housing units available.,112,,
829,0.97,8098.657,8111.169,"So, my expectation is that we get answers to these very important questions to help us understand how our public resources are being used to remove people, especially in light of the Coronavirus.",112,,
830,0.97,8111.236,8115.841,Two things for the district.,112,,
831,0.97,8115.907,8120.846,Last week I toward Georgetown to see the traffic impact on the community as a relates to the West Seattle bridge closure.,112,,
832,0.97,8120.912,8127.619,Georgetown as you may or may not know has about 1200 residents in the neighborhood.,112,,
833,0.97,8127.686,8131.256,"But there are 29,000 jobs in Georgetown.",112,,
834,0.97,8131.323,8150.375,And so even just without people coming through the neighborhood to come downtown to work there's a lot of activity happening and the neighbors are very concerned about the health impact and traffic impact of having potentially tens of thousands of more people coming through the neighborhood.,112,,
835,0.97,8150.442,8190.382,"So we will be continuing to work with Us.To make sure that there are mitigation strategies in place .

855,0.97,8290.782,8308.7,I want to thank Councilmember Morales for bringing forward this legislation related to encampment Removals and Codifying some of the practices that the executive claims it is following during the Covid-19 crisis.,118,,
856,0.97,8308.767,8311.87,I want to thank Council member Lewis for agreeing to hear it in his committee.,118,,
857,0.97,8311.936,8345.77,"You know, I want to flag that a number of us under Council member Lewis leadership back in August, I'm sorry, in April, April 3, following our last Committee on homelessness meeting, we proposed to the executive a Non-Legislative approach --",118,,
858,0.97,8345.837,8346.805,We are losing you.,119,,
859,0.97,8346.871,8352.877,I'm sorry about that.,120,,
860,0.97,8352.944,8353.912,My Internet connection is unstable.,120,,

866,0.97,8369.594,8387.011,In a way of providing sort of our policy preferences on a number of sort of levers that could be adjusted for the encampment policies that the executive currently uses the came out of the committee discussions.,122,,
867,0.97,8387.078,8399.824,To my knowledge we have not received any response to this April 3 request to work in partnership with the executive on developing this new policy.,122,,
868,0.97,8399.891,8413.571,I think as everybody knows I have been hesitant in passing legislation related to in camera removal policies out of a belief that it is the executive's responsibility to manage public land.,122,,
869,0.97,8413.638,8447.906,"But given the fact that the executive has not responded to our requests to work on a revamped Non-Legislative policy and given that there seems to be continued convergence between what they say the policy is and what it is that the navigation team is actually doing, I'm looking forward to working on this piece of legislation.",122,,
870,0.97,8447.972,8452.477,Proposed by Councilmember Morales.,122,,

884,0.97,8570.528,8593.451,"I want to make sure as we are, make sure the colleagues, as we continue to move an inch towards June that you all are sort of hearing from me that that will mean that we will have some level of her introduction of items that go to the appropriate Committee for consideration.",126,,
885,0.97,8593.518,8605.596,We will have some recommendations coming out of the city clerk office pretty soon that sort of give us all clear guidance on those issues and I look forward to have the conversation with all of you about that in the coming months.,126,,

890,0.97,8639.163,8651.309,"And I appreciate Council member Herbals comments that what we talked about a few months ago, I'm very interested in understanding how the obstruction is defined and how that is being implemented.",127,,
891,0.97,8651.376,8654.746,I am a little bit concerned about legislating that.,127,,
892,0.97,8654.812,8672.797,"I want to make sure that we are not, the bill doesn't inadvertently authorize Encampments in city parks for example, I want to look forward to digging into that and thank you for sending it to committee so that we can do that.",127,,
893,0.97,8672.864,8677.068,Any other questions or comments on this report?,128,,
894,0.97,8677.135,8681.439,"Okay, it looks like there are no additional comments.",128,,

897,0.97,8691.749,8700.224,There is one item today from the Finance and housing committee.,129,,
898,0.97,8700.291,8724.015,"Constable number one, 11979 one, this bill appropriates will perform a dollars in Federal grants related to Covid- 19 emergency response to go to Hst for the purposes of shelter or distribution and Dedensification with the attention for these funds to be used to get individuals into Ideally non--- homelessness and at risk of contracting Covid.",129,,
899,0.97,8724.082,8740.031,"We appreciate the ongoing devastation that we've had with members of the executive team, especially--and we understand there are additional Federal dollars that will be coming down for consideration next week or the following week.",129,,
900,0.97,8740.098,8751.809,"$1.4 million is not a lot of money, we did hold back this amount from the--funds that we authorized in a piece of legislation a few weeks ago.",129,,
901,0.97,8751.876,8780.471,"The intent was to hold back went before million dollars to have conversations about strategies to Dedensify shelters, identify places for people to go that would be in less Congregant settings, especially given the public health guidance that encourages us to consider safer spaces, not to get shelters, spaces, or folks who are at high risk for Covid due to their age or underlying health conditions.",129,,
902,0.97,8780.538,8802.393,"I did hear a significant desire from people who work with the homeless population for funding to go to staff Ppe, cleaning services, food services, so that all of the Dedensification were could be staffed and implemented for the CDC guidance.",129,,
903,0.97,8802.46,8813.204,"$1.4 million is not a lot of money, I think it does help to begin the conversation that we hope will be added to in the future weeks when we see additional Federal dollars.",129,,
904,0.97,8813.271,8823.447,"As folks know the previous categories of funding that we looked at included--etc., these are part of the the C.A.R.E.S.",129,,
905,0.97,8823.514,8825.55,Act funding which had a bunch of different funding buckets.,129,,
906,0.97,8825.616,8828.986,Some of that could be used for rental assistant and some could not.,129,,
907,0.97,8829.053,8832.557,There were smaller amounts that were more defined based on programs.,129,,
908,0.97,8832.623,8859.684,The concern of the time was the cares act funding did not have the ability for us to maybe be more flexible down the road with dollars in trying to get folks into additional assistance for example . We have learned that the krona relief fund which is $130 million authorized under the C.A.R.E.S.,129,,
909,0.97,8859.75,8867.291,"Act, did not go to all municipalities, but we did find out that we are able to now use the funds for additional assistance to go to until assistance.",129,,
910,0.97,8867.358,8873.731,That should help us but have to make the Sophie's choice between rental assistance and Dedensification issues.,129,,
911,0.97,8873.798,8893.417,We really appreciate the going conversation and we know there will be more Federal funds--and wanted to make sure that we did emphasize--to get folks into appropriate housing and Dedensification strategies.,129,,
912,0.97,8893.484,8916.741,"Before million dollars in this legislation would go to a host of different Dedensification strategies--we're hoping to have ongoing conversations with the future dollars about how we can get more funding into pay for staff Ppe, cleaning, food services, and other safe housing options for those were living on shelters.",129,,
913,0.97,8916.807,8944.135,"It's not a ton of money but we hope this will have future funds and make an impact for those individuals who are needing Dedensification efforts and that we can get funding from the Corona relief Fund, $100 million, as much as we can out to the rental assistance programs and I want to thank folks at United way who have also provided feedback over the last few weeks as we know we want rental assistance out the door as much as possible.",129,,
914,0.97,8944.201,8952.91,Trying to look both at prevention for falling into homelessness and helping those who are currently experiencing homelessness during this public health crisis.,129,,
915,0.97,8952.977,8964.889,"As of right now, colleagues, the intent is to move that piece of legislation forward and I want to thank--in the various departments for their ongoing conversations.",129,,
916,0.97,8964.955,8979.537,"There are no other items for today from the Finance and housing Committee, I want to say a few comments about the bill that Council member umbrella spoke about.",129,,
917,0.97,8979.603,8981.972,Really I think the intent here is to follow the CDC guidance.,129,,
918,0.97,8982.039,9010.101,"A few months ago, prior to us working remotely, I know Councilmember Rollison and bill, I had a bull, a number of us were working at ways to respond to the Covid crisis given that we knew we had the third highest number of folks were living unsheltered in our city and the entire country, trying to be Proactive in responding to some of those concerns that we knew were coming with Communicable disease like Covid was really important.",129,,
919,0.97,9010.167,9011.202,We put that effort on hold.,129,,
920,0.97,9011.268,9043.3,I think as many of you has talked about with the hope that the commitment to not relocate pill full would help in the interim and given the CDC guidance and working with a handful of Stakeholders across the city it was clear that folks really desired to have a public health amendment to the current guidance under the Covid emergency so that any health related concern that was cited first triggered ordination with public health and an appropriate public health response.,129,,
921,0.97,9043.367,9061.585,Then we looked at individual rooms and temporary housing for folks were currently living outside . I want to underscore the CDC guidance has clearly said--can you hear me?,129,,
922,0.97,9061.652,9104.028,"The CDC guidance has clearly said it is very concerning that folks are currently living in it Encampments, if the sign gets posted that says there will be a removal people tend to disperse into the community before removal teams come or the navigation teams come and I think the question that the Councilmember had about capacity at shelters is important but even with the posting of the signs we know that that can have an unintended consequence and we have to prevent with the deadly, Communicable disease, Covid is different, you can't vaccinate people.",129,,
923,0.97,9104.094,9120.244,"Handwashing facilities, etc., it's concerning that anyone who has potentially shown symptoms of Covid or at risk of spreading Covid who really want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to prevent it and not create the unintended consequence of having people disperse into the community.",129,,
924,0.97,9120.311,9138.662,"This is a hybrid bill related to try to get--working with populations, raising concerns about how to get more public health guidance, thank you in advance for the conversation.",129,,
925,0.97,9138.729,9144.268,I know this has been a conversation you been having at various levels as well.,129,,
926,0.97,9144.335,9155.846,Hoping for clarification on the administrative side as we look at this crisis continuing for a few months.,129,,
927,0.97,9155.913,9202.96,"I want to let you know about a form, we looted to this at last week's meeting, we are going to have a economic forum to, if you don't have an invite you should, we are sending this out via social media alerts for economic forum and I hope to make sure that folks have the chance to join via Youtube or live stream, we are also--interested in participating on the zoom line, we have to have limited numbers so thank you--I think maybe one more can join us.",129,,

931,0.97,9266.39,9271.161,Much of what we talk about is responding to the immediate public health crisis.,129,,
932,0.97,9271.228,9289.113,"We also know there is an economic crisis on the rise in, wanting to have a better understanding from the National to local level and how this public health crisis is going to exacerbate existing inequities in our system and create additional economic hardship.",129,,
933,0.97,9289.179,9290.114,That is the focus.,129,,
934,0.97,9290.18,9297.821,It is really from the perspective of getting prepared for the future budget and what we potentially have to deal with in terms of decreased revenue and increased need.,129,,

941,0.97,9355.579,9359.917,If we could work together to try to get through this as quickly as possible that would be great.,130,,
942,0.97,9359.983,9360.984,Okay.,130,,

945,0.97,9365.122,9398.255,"I want to flag the fact that although the legislation that Councilmember Mosqueda has on today's agenda was originally proposed as a way of having a conversation with the Mayor's office around sheltering as a particular model of the Dedensification, the language in the legislation itself only requires that the funding be used for shelter redistribution and Dedensification.",131,,
946,0.97,9398.322,9409.666,It does not require the specific model of --,131,,

948,0.97,9416.907,9417.274,Quite often.,132,,

954,0.97,9429.52,9433.857,I want to flag that the legislation in the bill only requires that the funding be used for shelter redistribution and Dedensification.,135,,
955,0.97,9433.924,9446.103,It does not require that those funds be used in a way that is not congregate care shelter redistribution and Dedensification.,135,,
956,0.97,9446.17,9462.085,Want to flag that the Federal funds and Commerce funds that will be coming later can be used both for rent assistance as well as the purposes that this bill proposes.,135,,
957,0.97,9462.152,9476.767,We could have allocated these dollars to rent assistance and waited for funds to come later to serve this purpose.,135,,
958,0.97,9476.834,9478.468,"But instead, we are doing the opposite.",135,,
959,0.97,9478.535,9501.959,We are going to move forward with legislation to fund shelter redistribution and Dedensification and will use funds in the Commerce and Federal funding later to pay for the rent assistance funds that we had planned for the Mayor had planned to allocate when she proposed this legislation.,135,,
960,0.97,9502.025,9512.536,"But it is really important because I know the public is looking at this conversation around hotels as a way, as a method to do the Dedensification.",135,,
961,0.97,9512.603,9541.298,"I don't want people to think we have accomplished the goal N that I think is a goal of this Council, to encourage the executive to embrace the idea of funding hotels as a model of Dedensification rather than funding more congregate care facilities to Dedensify shelters.",135,,
962,0.97,9541.365,9543.767,Thank you.,135,,
963,0.97,9543.834,9563.32,"I will be careful with my wording this afternoon because I think it's important to note that there is future funds coming and we want--yes, I appreciate that.",136,,
964,0.97,9563.387,9564.321,Thank you so much.,137,,
965,0.97,9564.388,9575.265,Any other comments or questions for Councilmember Mosqueda on her report?,137,,

970,0.97,9586.743,9596.62,This week I will be meeting with neighborhood restaurants in district 40 hear about the experiences of small businesses as we move closer to phase 2 of reopening our economy.,138,,
971,0.97,9596.687,9613.603,"Regarding technology the committee I chair is called transportation utilities and there has been a lot of attention on transportation, bridges, transit, and also utilities, including the recent completion of an odd and his cup program during the Covid crisis.",138,,
972,0.97,9613.67,9616.139,A committee includes technology.,138,,
973,0.97,9616.206,9623.046,And the Covid crisis has exposed some disturbing disparities with access to technology.,138,,
974,0.97,9623.113,9632.522,I believe technology access is a social justice issue and I plan to focus on this issue and share some thoughts on it in the near future.,138,,
975,0.97,9632.589,9638.862,Thank you.,138,,
976,0.97,9638.929,9640.497,"Thank you, Councilmember Pederson for that report.",139,,
977,0.97,9640.564,9650.273,Are there any other questions or comments?,139,,
978,0.97,9650.34,9651.908,We will go ahead and move along.,139,,
979,0.97,9651.975,9652.876,Next up is Councilmember Sawant.,139,,
980,0.97,9652.943,9656.747,The floor is yours.,139,,
981,0.97,9656.813,9657.948,"Thank you, president Gonzalez.",140,,
982,0.97,9658.015,9659.182,Good morning everyone.,140,,
983,0.97,9659.249,9662.219,"I think it is good afternoon, everyone.",140,,
984,0.97,9662.285,9668.925,There are no items on today's city council agenda for the Sustainability committee.,140,,
985,0.97,9668.992,9674.297,"The next meeting of the committee is scheduled for a special time this Thursday, may 21 at 6:00 P.M.",140,,
986,0.97,9674.364,9675.232,Over zoom.,140,,
987,0.97,9675.298,9692.716,On the agenda we will be discussing--to fund immediate Covid relief and public jobs building affordable social housing and a green new deal--recovery.,140,,
988,0.97,9692.783,9693.483,The Covid emergency.,140,,
989,0.97,9693.55,9704.394,"Next we will hear from grassroots Renter organizations discussing the movement for a full suspension of rent, mortgage and utility payments and importantly how they can get organized to fight Evictions.",140,,
990,0.97,9704.461,9718.675,"Organizing the buildings to fight Evictions which will very likely, there will be a massive attempted Evictions with the Moratoria is lifted--pandemic has been ended.",140,,
991,0.97,9718.742,9734.891,This item will include district constituents who are tenants of buildings that are owned by wealthy individuals but are managed by the Megacorporations and Associates and hopefully we can learn lessons from how they got organized.,140,,
992,0.97,9734.958,9750.006,My office holed up--labor attorney--who pointed out that telling city council what topics they can legislate on is not an emergency power for the governor.,140,,
993,0.97,9750.073,9757.914,"Quote, the governor has attempted to exercise the emergency power to prevent local governments from doing their job.",140,,
994,0.97,9757.981,9759.249,Evaluate and enact legislation.,140,,
995,0.97,9759.316,9793.316,"It is actually shocking and also clearly, legally, unsupportable if you look at the statute that gives the governor emergency powers,--the governor has a lot of power to prohibit things in the interest of preserving life, health, property, but telling city council what topics you can and cannot legislate about, what kinds of topics a can and cannot have, a public meeting about, is clearly not necessary to help observe life, health, property or the public peace, Unquote.",140,,
996,0.97,9793.383,9820.277,"However, if he did have the of authority to do that, the argument that the legislation for Covid relief and job to cover he does not read the requirement of being necessary to respond to the Covid public health emergency, does not pass the common sense muster that excuses only reasonable big business who do not want to pay the taxes and--big business is never a good time to tax and for social need.",140,,
997,0.97,9820.343,9832.255,"Even the worst recession during the great depression and the taxes been modest, only on the top 2% of the corporations.",140,,
998,0.97,9832.322,9862.319,"The argument that a virtual meeting violates the open public meetings act, Opm it, is not Ray, the purpose is to make sure that the public has access to and is able to observe agency meetings and in this case is able to observe the city Council and a meeting--thousands of people, provides public access and people who can get off work get downtown and deal with parking can actually attend.",140,,
999,0.97,9862.385,9866.99,Know when can plausibly say a virtual only meeting reaches the Opma.,140,,
1000,0.97,9867.057,9884.04,It is goal of the Opma and--hinted--the Attorney General admits that all kinds of public meetings take place virtually by telephone or now by zoom throughout the state.,140,,
1001,0.97,9884.107,9891.147,That is routine.,140,,
1002,0.97,9891.214,9897.687,"Having said that, of course, I support every effort to make changes to the governor's proclamation to enable municipalities to carry at work in the interest of ordinary people.",140,,
1003,0.97,9897.754,9901.124,Our movement will not be stalled in any way.,140,,
1004,0.97,9901.191,9908.632,We will meet on Thursday at the Sustainability and Renters act Committee at 6:00 P.M.,140,,
1005,0.97,9908.698,9926.082,All Councilmembers are invited and I encourage you to join me in--the legal ability--to meet the needs of the working class people.,140,,
1006,0.97,9926.149,9937.694,There was an article last week where they spoke about and announced a promising projection of job creation from--plan.,140,,
1007,0.97,9937.761,9947.57,I suggested she be invited--and I appreciate Councilmember Mosqueda inviting her to speak at the economic forum.,140,,
1008,0.97,9947.637,9957.147,This article is titled Seattle is considering an Amazon tax.,140,,
1009,0.97,9957.213,9962.852,It is a model for taking back fiscal power.,140,,
1010,0.97,9962.919,9964.354,I will briefly quote from the article.,140,,
1011,0.97,9964.421,9969.959,It says in the aftermath of the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 Federal corporate tax collection dropped sharply.,140,,
1012,0.97,9970.026,9984.374,"In the absence of reform of the Federal level, States and cities--in order to avoid catastrophic austerity that would destroy jobs and prolong economic suffering after the public health crisis has been resolved.",140,,
1013,0.97,9984.441,9993.75,It is crucial for understanding how peer eat of corporate profits left workers of the corporations vulnerable to a loss of income.,140,,
1014,0.97,9993.817,10003.693,Over and over again major American corporations earning record profits have thought of efforts to raise wages of the lowest paid workers to a decent salary.,140,,
1015,0.97,10003.76,10009.666,"The need to make record shareholder payments with it, justification for squeezing employee compensation.",140,,
1016,0.97,10009.733,10034.357,Corporation spend $6.3 trillion on the upper part of--this increasing shareholder--over all other users of corporate funds is a prime driver behind the increasing concentration of wealth among a small segment of American--anchorage everybody to read it.,140,,
1017,0.97,10034.424,10054.043,Even the--predicts a long-term--vulnerable workers and recommends public works programs that expand job opportunities and public tax revenues which are key features of our Amazon tax legislation.,140,,
1018,0.97,10054.11,10064.22,"As customer number morale is mentioned, I'm happy to postpone--to restrict this week's homeless encampment or the Covid-19 emergency.",140,,
1019,0.97,10064.287,10078.234,"As I said many times this week, it's inhumane and ineffective and Council millions of dollars a year to move homeless people from one street corner to the next only with fewer belongings and greater desperation.",140,,
1020,0.97,10078.301,10090.58,"Those resources would be far better spent on affordable housing, tiniest villages or other services so people actually have somewhere to move to and can have a faster transition and actually a transition to housing.",140,,
1021,0.97,10090.647,10106.463,Our movement has said streets are inhumane and ineffective and Unfortunately many efforts by the people's budget movement to move legislation have been blocked by Councilmembers in 2017 and 2018 and last year.,140,,
1022,0.97,10106.529,10108.765,I hope those efforts will continue.,140,,
1023,0.97,10108.832,10110.934,I'm hope be to be a cosponsor.,140,,
1024,0.97,10111.0,10132.856,"Is a--crucial time to stop forcing homeless people to move, however, we should be clear this is not settling the question of Sweeps and I hope Councilmembers--restrictions on the Sweeps after the emergency.",140,,
1025,0.97,10132.922,10140.797,"Also on today's introduction to the county, legislation that--preparing for my office.",140,,
1026,0.97,10140.864,10153.142,"To extend the Sony protection to prevent the destruction of Seattle's remaining mobile home parks,--thank you Council member Juarez for agreeing to cosponsor this legislation.",140,,
1027,0.97,10153.209,10162.118,The mobile home parks have requested the--from displacement over the last couple of years.,140,,
1028,0.97,10162.185,10180.37,"Council members who are around the last two years will remember moving to the testimony and the council passed temperate productions to provide time for the executives to do the analysis required to make those or other zoning protections permanent, unfortunately, that has not happened.",140,,
1029,0.97,10180.436,10184.874,And so we will need a Council bill for that temporary extension.,140,,
1030,0.97,10184.941,10208.097,"The legislation doesn't require a public hearing, it is my hope that we can hold a public hearing during the Council meeting next week and vote on this, these protections, the following Monday, June 1, if there is not enough time to have the public hearing next week we should hold it at the Council meeting on June 1 given the standard 30 days for legislation to go into effect.",140,,
1031,0.97,10208.164,10217.707,That timely allow the extension to become law just before the current zoning protection is set to expire on July 10.,140,,
1032,0.97,10217.774,10235.658,And last but not least my office is bringing forward legislation to amend the Seattle when he spoke code to allow for electronic petitions and electronic signature gathering . We looked into that and we heard from the attorneys and lawyers that Seattle has authority as first-class city to set its own standard for petition and signature format.,140,,
1033,0.97,10235.725,10242.098,Therefore the authority to Llow Online forum for petition and signatures.,140,,
1034,0.97,10251.341,10256.446,Essential that the city ADOPTS measures that support and strengthen democracy.,140,,
1035,0.97,10256.512,10270.059,"Therefore, in addition to the electronic petition and signature gathering aspect my office will also be looking into other measures to reduce barriers to democratic rights and potentially presenting other legislation in the weeks ahead.",140,,
1036,0.97,10270.126,10272.428,Thank you.,140,,
1037,0.97,10272.495,10279.102,"Thank you, for that report.",141,,
1038,0.97,10279.168,10280.336,Are there any other questions?,141,,
1039,0.97,10280.403,10281.504,"Councilmember Lewis, please.",141,,
1040,0.97,10281.571,10282.972,Thank you.,142,,
1041,0.97,10283.039,10287.243,I have some comments on the report if that would be in order at this time.,142,,
1042,0.97,10287.31,10291.581,"It is, now is the time.",143,,
1043,0.97,10291.648,10294.183,"Any other Councilmembers who have questions or comments on that report, do so now.",143,,
1044,0.97,10294.25,10295.785,Thank you.,144,,
1045,0.97,10295.852,10298.021,I want to respond.,144,,
1046,0.97,10298.087,10305.528,As a member of the Committee on Sustainability and Renters rights.,144,,
1047,0.97,10305.595,10336.259,"I appreciate and respect customer number so I and her sense of urgency in the inequity of the tax code and need for new revenue to address problems we are facing . I have informed her office and I'm standing here today that I will not be attending that committee meeting . to respond to the arguments that it been raised by Council members of our and Dimitri, you know, I don't think there is a dispute that there's an argument to be made.",144,,
1048,0.97,10336.325,10344.534,"To my--making similar arguments about the extent of the governor's authority, working through the courts, arguments to be made.",144,,
1049,0.97,10344.6,10353.076,I think it comes down to how much personal risk we as a Council and we as individuals are willing to face.,144,,
1050,0.97,10353.142,10359.148,Really resting on those arguments which I don't find compelling and don't believe a judge would find compelling in the state.,144,,
1051,0.97,10359.215,10380.903,"On the other end of the spectrum the advice that we have received from governor Inslee and the Attorney General, the Seattle city attorney's office, the Council president and her memo that she distributed, the majority of this Council including all of the lawyers on the Council, has been a different analysis.",144,,
1052,0.97,10380.97,10401.991,"I just want to remind everybody, too, we are open to individual violations of the Opm A. I think we are on notice having received guidance from our lawyers and the attorneys office as well as receiving the letter, distribute it last week by Council President Gonzalez.",144,,
1053,0.97,10402.058,10407.029,The city's analysis of the Opma which I personally concur.,144,,
1054,0.97,10407.096,10417.039,I think given that notice we would be vulnerable to participate in activities that have been deemed to not comply with that analysis.,144,,
1055,0.97,10417.106,10424.981,For those reasons I will be attending the meeting and I want to make that clear for the public and for my colleagues.,144,,
1056,0.97,10425.047,10425.281,Thank you.,144,,
1057,0.97,10425.348,10449.338,"Thank you, for those remarks and I just want to tell, just quickly clarify that I think there's a communication that went out by Councilmember Sawant's office seemingly implying that she could establish Quorum for her committee if any Council members attend the committee.",145,,
1058,0.97,10449.405,10452.241,The meeting that she is hoping to be able to have on Thursday evening.,145,,
1059,0.97,10452.308,10460.917,I want to clarify for the benefit of all Councilmembers and for the public that that's not how the Council rules work as amended.,145,,
1060,0.97,10460.983,10469.792,It has to be members of the committee that attend or don't attend in order to satisfy that Quorum requirement.,145,,
1061,0.97,10469.859,10483.873,So even if not committee members attended the committee meeting those comes members are not members of the committee it does not resolve the core issues as required under Council roles.,145,,
1062,0.97,10483.94,10488.945,I want to discuss and clarify that for the record.,145,,
1063,0.97,10489.011,10500.122,The Council roles given that there has been some inaccurate information pushed out to the general public about how it works in relation to establishing or not meeting Quorum.,145,,
1064,0.97,10500.189,10507.997,I want to make sure that we are all on the same page as it relates to that particular component.,145,,
1065,0.97,10508.064,10512.101,Councilmember Sawant.,145,,
1066,0.97,10512.168,10519.208,Thank you.,146,,
1067,0.97,10519.275,10522.678,I don't agree that any inaccurate information has been provided.,146,,
1068,0.97,10522.745,10525.915,I have not applied anything.,146,,
1069,0.97,10525.982,10539.528,"About Quorum in any way, in fact, I don't, since I don't agree with the legal assessment from the office and the legal assessment from--buying into for me, that's not an issue.",146,,
1070,0.97,10539.595,10540.396,I see this politically.,146,,
1071,0.97,10540.463,10562.084,"I hope the Council members who are truly interested in pushing for Progressive revenue and who have, who don't agree with that legal assessment which I don't agree with, for sure, and for me, it's not a question of Quorum, it is a Council question, for me it's a political question.",146,,
1072,0.97,10562.151,10575.197,"Who decides which representative decides to come to the meeting in order to make it clear that this is important, not stalling, not allowing the movement to be stalled is important.",146,,
1073,0.97,10575.264,10585.241,And boycotting city council meetings is not an option and ultimately every elected presented his choice.,146,,
1074,0.97,10585.308,10588.477,I am not trying to make that choice.,146,,
1075,0.97,10588.544,10591.247,You will have to make that choice for yourself.,146,,
1076,0.97,10591.314,10597.42,But I don't agree in any way whatsoever that any misinformation was provided.,146,,
1077,0.97,10597.486,10624.847,"In fact, the misinformation has been all from the political establishment, smoke and mirrors game that this will be a legal when there are so many examples of legislation moving forward were similar arguments in made that housing is--in the findings for the legislation that in fact Councilmember Lewis himself brought forward.",146,,
1078,0.97,10624.914,10625.915,"Again, these are political opinions.",146,,
1079,0.97,10625.982,10656.712,"These are not legal assessments and I would also quote from the article in which the reporter, Natalie Graham, says I asked Lewis if he could point me to where he got that analysis, he reiterated this point, while adding--but not anything specifically and nowhere--proclamation does it say that the governor has that power.",146,,
1080,0.97,10656.779,10666.088,"So again, it is how you read it and since there is no agreement on that I think it's a question of opinion whether you decide to come or not.",146,,
1081,0.97,10666.155,10684.173,But I certainly reject any idea that in--from my office and I will end by saying I'm not surprised--not talk about--absolutely--the Wall Street Journal has published two editorials against us.,146,,
1082,0.97,10684.24,10708.531,"This is the bastion of the capitalist--New York City, where they concerned about something small like this because they know it can actually have a snowball effect just like the $50 minimum wage victory that we won from the movement while other cities were inspired because austerity is staring cities in the state in the face.",146,,
1083,0.97,10708.597,10712.401,So you can make your choice.,146,,
1084,0.97,10712.468,10718.874,"Excuse me, I see that Councilmember Lewis has raised his hand.",147,,
1085,0.97,10718.941,10719.275,Feel free.,147,,
1086,0.97,10719.341,10757.446,"Thank you, just to correct the record on the quote, I want to say for members of the public and members of the committee, that has been updated, the bit of Latin as Natalie put it was actually Rcw--I want to clarify that for the listening public.",148,,
1087,0.97,10757.513,10781.804,Obviously that interpretation and my response to Natalie was something I wanted to correct given that I think it is important and I think it is something that the public should be engaged in and looking into on this discussion of the Opma.,148,,
1088,0.97,10781.871,10819.675,"Thank you, any other comments or questions? we have had a lot of conversations on this issue and multiple times in open public sessions so we will go ahead and continue to move through the agenda for today.",149,,
1089,0.97,10819.742,10826.115,Let me pull up the roll call for this afternoon.,149,,
1090,0.97,10826.182,10832.021,The next person up is --,149,,
