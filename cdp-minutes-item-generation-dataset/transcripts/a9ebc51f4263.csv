80,0.97,402.135,402.935,They don't need more.,20,,
81,0.97,402.935,411.043,Local right-wing media have whipped people into a frenzy about an imaginary skyrocketing crime wave.,20,,

362,0.97,1873.771,1875.874,Enlisting trusted community members to intervene when violence occurs.,70,,
363,0.97,1875.874,1879.21,Advocacy for survivors.,70,,
364,0.97,1879.21,1887.986,The program needs financial investments to continue and to keep Innovating on these alternatives.,70,,
365,0.97,1887.986,1888.586,Thank you.,71,,
366,0.97,1888.586,1892.624,"If you want to send in the rest of your comments, that would be wonderful.",71,,
367,0.97,1892.624,1893.725,"And Jason, good morning.",71,,
368,0.97,1893.725,1900.732,Good morning.,72,,
369,0.97,1900.732,1903.134,I just wanted to echo a couple of comments.,72,,
370,0.97,1903.134,1906.304,"Jason, could you speak up just a little bit?",73,,
371,0.97,1906.304,1909.907,"Great, that is better.",73,,
372,0.97,1909.907,1911.342,"Hi, again my name is Jason.",74,,
373,0.97,1911.342,1914.145,I am a resident of district 4.,74,,
374,0.97,1914.145,1920.051,I wanted to speak on the accountability budget.,74,,
375,0.97,1920.051,1921.319,Items in the upcoming city budget.,74,,
376,0.97,1921.319,1932.263,"Adding them up, it looks like we're going to budget $10.5 million for an accountability system that very few people seem satisfied with.",74,,
377,0.97,1932.263,1960.391,"At the very least I would want the Council to deeply look into the Whistleblower complaints that show the office of Inspector General is Prioritizing political relationships with the office of police accountability and intentionally telling employees not to create written records that reflect poorly on the office of police accountability, which is crazy.",74,,
378,0.97,1960.391,1964.362,"The job is to investigate and hold the office of police accountability, accountable.",74,,
379,0.97,1964.362,1968.399,It is a crazy system.,74,,
380,0.97,1968.399,1976.14,"It should be completely redesigned but at the least it needs to be held to account before you fund it again, thank you.",74,,
381,0.97,1976.14,1981.412,"Okay, thank you so much and Judith, I still see you listed as muted.",75,,
382,0.97,1981.412,1984.816,We are going to give you one more chance.,75,,
383,0.97,1984.816,1985.116,Star six.,75,,
384,0.97,1985.116,1988.353,Sorry if it is frustrating over there.,75,,
385,0.97,1988.353,1998.896,"I know some folks have been hitting pound six, so I will keep you up for another second.",75,,
386,0.97,1998.896,2001.099,"I still see you muted, so I will move us on.",75,,
387,0.97,2001.099,2003.101,Please do send your comments to Council @ Seattle.Gov.,75,,
388,0.97,2003.101,2009.841,That does conclude today's public comment and we will head right into items of business as we have a packed agenda.,75,,
389,0.97,2009.841,2013.745,"Madam clerk, could you please read item number one into the record.",75,,
390,0.97,2013.745,2022.253,Agenda item--I apologize.,76,,
391,0.97,2022.253,2026.457,"Agenda item one, Seattle Department of Transportation for briefing and discussion.",76,,
392,0.97,2026.457,2031.763,"Thanks, Madam clerk.",77,,
393,0.97,2031.763,2032.83,Welcome Calvin chow from central staff.,77,,
394,0.97,2032.83,2036.467,Welcome back to the stage.,77,,
395,0.97,2036.467,2037.068,Aly Pennucci.,77,,
396,0.97,2037.068,2042.74,And I see Councilmember Pedersen as chair of transportation on the line.,77,,
397,0.97,2042.74,2043.04,Thank you.,77,,
398,0.97,2043.04,2056.387,"We will have Calvin begin the initial comments of that sounds good and then we will have you be the first to offer comments and thoughts, as well.",77,,
399,0.97,2056.387,2058.356,"Colleagues, I am going to switch.",77,,
400,0.97,2058.356,2061.859,The chair's prerogative.,77,,
401,0.97,2061.859,2075.673,"The presentations today are all very long and I appreciate the work central staff have done, so for today I will ask if Councilmembers who have Purview over these specific areas, if you did have opening comments, you are welcome to do that.",77,,
402,0.97,2075.673,2081.112,"If we have questions throughout, I want to make sure we have the chance to hear from you first.",77,,
403,0.97,2081.112,2086.617,"If you don't mind, Calvin, I will ask Councilmember Pedersen if there is anything you would like to say.",77,,
404,0.97,2086.617,2096.427,"You are welcome to do that and we will take questions, but there may be questions throughout, so I don't want to Miss the chance to get you in for some opening ones.",77,,
405,0.97,2096.427,2101.032,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",78,,
406,0.97,2101.032,2114.245,"If it is okay with you, we could just have Calvin chow start his presentation and I think I will have comments when we get to the issue I.D.",78,,
407,0.97,2114.245,2114.846,Section of it.,78,,
408,0.97,2114.846,2115.446,That's great.,79,,
409,0.97,2115.446,2124.222,"Thank you and when we get to those issues, we would love to hear your thoughts and get other people's thoughts on the issue I.D .'s.",79,,
410,0.97,2124.222,2126.858,"Calvin, is it okay if people do have questions throughout if they ask you?",79,,
411,0.97,2126.858,2127.458,Absolutely.,80,,
412,0.97,2127.458,2128.226,Okay.,81,,
413,0.97,2128.226,2134.565,Thank you.,81,,
414,0.97,2134.565,2136.3,Let's take it away on Seattle Department of transportation.,81,,
415,0.97,2136.3,2137.268,"Councilmembers, good morning.",82,,
416,0.97,2137.268,2145.743,My name is Calvin chow with central staff and I will be reviewing the proposed budget and my colleague will be managing the slides.,82,,
417,0.97,2145.743,2149.647,"My presentation will be a high- level summary of the issue paper, also attached to the agenda.",82,,
418,0.97,2149.647,2154.285,I thought we should start with an overview of the budget.,82,,
419,0.97,2154.285,2155.086,"Next slide, thank you.",82,,
420,0.97,2155.086,2167.798,So the first slide summarizes Sdot operating expenses only and you can see the proposed budget is about 15% higher than the 2021 adopted budget.,82,,
421,0.97,2167.798,2169.3,$318 million.,82,,
422,0.97,2169.3,2171.502,There are two main factors for this increase.,82,,
423,0.97,2171.502,2176.207,"The first is in ability operations, which is row a.",82,,
424,0.97,2176.207,2189.086,"This increased by 26%, because it includes 19 million additional purchases for Metro that are part of the proposition one transit measure.",82,,
425,0.97,2189.086,2203.434,"The other major factor is in row f, which reflects the transfer of the parking enforcement division from SPD to Sdot, so that is $18.4 million of General Fund.",82,,
426,0.97,2203.434,2208.139,"If you exclude these adjustments, then the operating budget is really a continuation of 2021 levels of service.",82,,
427,0.97,2208.139,2221.319,"I would also note that the budget has not restored operational cuts made during the 2021 budget, $5.9 million, scattered between a number of different Sdot programs.",82,,
428,0.97,2221.319,2222.453,"Next slide, please.",82,,
429,0.97,2222.453,2236.534,"This slide shows capital appropriations for Sdot spending and as a reminder, capital spending can vary from year to year, based on project schedules.",82,,
430,0.97,2236.534,2238.536,Fluctuations are not necessarily a result of policy changes.,82,,
431,0.97,2238.536,2244.275,The 2022 proposed budget is 11% higher than last year.,82,,
432,0.97,2244.275,2245.276,About $400 million for capital.,82,,
433,0.97,2245.276,2257.989,The most significant proposals are $5.2 million for bridge repair and 2.4 to restart the streetcar project.,82,,
434,0.97,2257.989,2259.89,Both of these will be discussed in the issues section.,82,,
435,0.97,2259.89,2266.197,"In total, including all capital and operating costs, the proposed budget is 13% more than the 2021 adopted budget at about $718 million.",82,,
436,0.97,2266.197,2269.2,At the very bottom --,82,,
437,0.97,2269.2,2272.903,"Just very briefly, Calvin.",83,,
438,0.97,2272.903,2289.52,"I wanted to just remind folks, the chat function does not necessarily work as the best feature on this remote system that we have here, so I am going to ask for folks to let me know.",83,,
439,0.97,2289.52,2296.594,"Are you hearing any feedback and if so, if there is anything we can do on the technical side?",83,,
440,0.97,2296.594,2300.731,Some folks are hearing static feedback.,83,,
441,0.97,2300.731,2309.273,"We will just keep our ear on it and if you have technical concerns or Audio concerns, let us know and we will try to get those fixed.",83,,
442,0.97,2309.273,2314.745,"Sorry, I just want to make sure it is coming through loud and clear on Seattle channel and for all of our colleagues.",83,,
443,0.97,2314.745,2319.216,"If you bear with me for a moment, I will move --",84,,
444,0.97,2319.216,2325.389,We are going to go with high- Tech Headphones with a microphone.,85,,
445,0.97,2325.389,2330.361,Folks following along at home?,85,,
446,0.97,2330.361,2330.961,Thanks so much.,85,,
447,0.97,2330.961,2336.267,Bear with us one second.,85,,
448,0.97,2336.267,2339.737,"And thank you for alerting us, Councilmembers.",85,,
449,0.97,2339.737,2344.475,That sounds better to me.,86,,
450,0.97,2344.475,2346.043,There was a high pitched something going on.,86,,
451,0.97,2346.043,2351.882,"Thank you, I am seeing multiple nods.",87,,
452,0.97,2351.882,2359.523,"Councilmember Pedersen and I did not hear it, so we might need to get our hearing checked, but others apparently did.",87,,
453,0.97,2359.523,2362.893,Can you hear me now?,88,,
454,0.97,2362.893,2363.494,Is that better?,88,,
455,0.97,2363.494,2364.895,I think it is good.,89,,
456,0.97,2364.895,2369.8,Can you pull the microphone closer to you?,89,,
457,0.97,2369.8,2370.801,Is that better?,90,,
458,0.97,2370.801,2371.602,I think so.,91,,
459,0.97,2371.602,2372.203,I am seeing nods.,91,,
460,0.97,2372.203,2373.404,"Calvin, thank you for that mix.",91,,
461,0.97,2373.404,2378.509,Sorry to interrupt you.,91,,
462,0.97,2378.509,2379.11,That is fine.,92,,
463,0.97,2379.11,2381.178,I was talking about the position list at the bottom.,92,,
464,0.97,2381.178,2389.487,You can see that the Department is actually increasing a number of positions by about 13% more.,92,,
465,0.97,2389.487,2390.321,"Sorry, 16% more.",92,,
466,0.97,2390.321,2399.63,This includes a total of 157.5 Ftes that are new to Sdot.,92,,
467,0.97,2399.63,2413.043,About 24 are Convergent temporary positions to permanent positions that would otherwise expire in 2022.,92,,
468,0.97,2413.043,2420.151,"There are 6 1/2 that are new positions with no budget appropriations required or requested, using funding within the existing program budgets.",92,,
469,0.97,2420.151,2425.356,And seven Ftes that are new positions.,92,,
470,0.97,2425.356,2432.963,"Next slide, please.",92,,
471,0.97,2432.963,2437.835,This slide shows Sdot revenues and resources that support Sdot expenses.,92,,
472,0.97,2437.835,2447.678,"As you can see in row O, the general contribution is increased and this is primarily due to the parking enforcement transfer.",92,,
473,0.97,2447.678,2450.381,"As you may recall, the move Seattle levy requires a minimum contribution to Sdot.",92,,
474,0.97,2450.381,2454.685,The minimum requirement for 2022 is $46.4 million.,92,,
475,0.97,2454.685,2466.297,"If you exclude the parking enforcement division and tax revenue from the Sdot budget, the remaining general fund contribution would be $49.5 million, still higher than the minimum requirement.",92,,
476,0.97,2466.297,2475.573,"I would also point out that these resources, while they match expenditures, they include a significant drawdown of fund balance.",92,,
477,0.97,2475.573,2479.076,"Next slide, please.",92,,
478,0.97,2479.076,2487.885,This slide shows some of Sdot's major funds and highlights that the Department is relying on almost $41 million of fund balance.,92,,
479,0.97,2487.885,2497.995,"Some of this is expected, particularly for move Seattle, where this is consistent with spending on portfolio projects.",92,,
480,0.97,2497.995,2508.105,"That expires in 2024 and is tied to a capital spending plan, but the other funds really do provide funding for ongoing operations and maintenance.",92,,
481,0.97,2508.105,2519.95,"Even with the use of fund balance, the budget relies on significant recovery of transportation revenue sources, though not back to Pre-Pandemic levels.",92,,
482,0.97,2519.95,2528.025,"There is a risk that if resources don't recover as quickly as projected, we would have to use additional fund balance or cut back on levels of service.",92,,
483,0.97,2528.025,2536.367,"With current financial projections, the transportation fund would not become net positive in revenue until 2024.",92,,
484,0.97,2536.367,2550.18,"So, that sort of concludes my broad overview and the next slides will cover issues for Council attention, so I'm happy to take any questions before I'm move into that.",92,,
485,0.97,2550.18,2551.015,Seeing none.,92,,
486,0.97,2551.015,2554.084,"So, --",92,,
487,0.97,2554.084,2560.958,"Pedersen, would you like to offer questions or comments?",93,,
488,0.97,2560.958,2573.304,"Thank you, my comments will be similar to the ones I offered when Sdot presented to us, which is that we are very appreciative of the leadership at Sdot.",94,,
489,0.97,2573.304,2583.28,"He has done a fantastic job, especially with so many different priorities.",94,,
490,0.97,2583.28,2584.581,To try to juggle and synthesize.,94,,
491,0.97,2584.581,2585.182,The Seattle bridge closure.,94,,
492,0.97,2585.182,2585.916,Dealing with that emergency.,94,,
493,0.97,2585.916,2594.425,"I really appreciate all of the city workers in the field, working on these projects for us.",94,,
494,0.97,2594.425,2636.066,"There are a lot of vision zero safety projects being implemented and I know there will be an interest in looking at district specific projects like pedestrian safety projects in our districts and bigger picture, you know, as I mentioned before, one disappointment with this budget is that it seems to kick the can down the road again on bridges and we have consistently discussed this issue, you know, for the past year and now that we have the full $700 million budget in front of us, my questions later as we get into issue I.D.",94,,
495,0.97,2636.066,2647.611,"Will be how can we make this a Yes and moment, where we are honoring previous discussions and decisions on how to allocate the $7 million of vehicle licensing.",94,,
496,0.97,2647.611,2655.185,"That is a discussion that in the past, in the way.",94,,
497,0.97,2655.185,2664.395,"Because now we have the full budget and we also have an infrastructure bill or two infrastructure bills, we hope, that are coming from the Congress.",94,,
498,0.97,2664.395,2680.31,"I hope this is a moment with the West Seattle bridge closure, with the bridge audit, that we, as a Council, well, the executive has not done much more with bridges.",94,,
499,0.97,2680.31,2682.98,This is an opportunity for us to do more for bridges.,94,,
500,0.97,2682.98,2684.415,Multimodal bridges.,94,,
501,0.97,2684.415,2692.99,Thinking about the University bridge and also thinking about commitments made by voters.,94,,
502,0.97,2692.99,2715.512,"If you remember, the Seattle times did an excellent piece on how there were Re-Estimates of the seismic upgrade costs to bridges throughout the city and there were 16 bridges promised for upgrades and Sdot, when they got revised estimates, they took some bridges off the list.",94,,
503,0.97,2715.512,2724.254,"So, I would like to look at addressing those bridge issues that includes the Fremont bridge, the University bridge.",94,,
504,0.97,2724.254,2729.793,"The second Avenue Southbridge, which was ranked poor by the bridge audit.",94,,
505,0.97,2729.793,2741.538,"So, as we get an issue i.d., I want to take an expansive view of the $700 million budget and also looking at the transit investments.",94,,
506,0.97,2741.538,2751.048,"As you know, we added $20--which added $7 million.",94,,
507,0.97,2751.048,2762.192,"So, that funding, what we will learn later I think in this, it is in Calvin's excellent memo, that there are some reserves.",94,,
508,0.97,2762.192,2768.499,Sdot is holding back a lot of money for transit and I know there is a desire to do more.,94,,
509,0.97,2768.499,2776.306,"I do just want to daylight the reserves that are just sitting there, about $17 million, I believe.",94,,
510,0.97,2776.306,2783.313,So we will talk more about that as we go through issue I.D.,94,,
511,0.97,2783.313,2785.582,"Chair Mosqueda, thank you, those are my initial thoughts and comments.",94,,
512,0.97,2785.582,2788.018,Thank you.,95,,
513,0.97,2788.018,2804.234,"Having recently tried to bring a bike trailer for a kid on one of these bridges and having to take the road because it would not fit, I completely appreciate the connection you have drawn between bridges and Multimodal transit options.",95,,
514,0.97,2804.234,2808.138,I look forward to getting into issue I.D.,95,,
515,0.97,2808.138,2809.439,I am not seeing additional comments.,95,,
516,0.97,2809.439,2810.14,Let's go ahead.,95,,
517,0.97,2810.14,2810.741,"Next slide, please.",96,,
518,0.97,2810.741,2815.445,So the first issue for discussion is the vehicle license fee.,96,,
519,0.97,2815.445,2826.423,Last year's budget authorized an increase in the fee from $20- $40 and at that time Council directed Sdot to engage in a Stakeholder process to develop a spending plan for additional revenue.,96,,
520,0.97,2826.423,2842.673,"After Sdot completed the process, council approved a spending plan that funded operational programs for safe streets, sidewalks, bridges and structures, transportation management and planning.",96,,
521,0.97,2842.673,2850.781,"In approving the 2021 spending, council also directed Sdot to develop a list of projects that could be funded by $100 million of bond financing.",96,,
522,0.97,2850.781,2861.158,This was the idea of turning the revenue stream into debt service to finance a large bond outlay.,96,,
523,0.97,2861.158,2871.501,"The project list was to include a minimum of $75 million for bridge projects and that is on the next couple slides, so we will go to that in a second.",96,,
524,0.97,2871.501,2877.808,"The 2022 proposed budget does not include funding for this list, but proposes to continue spending on the same operational programs as 2021.",96,,
525,0.97,2877.808,2887.117,So I have listed here an option to redirect those resources to other priorities.,96,,
526,0.97,2887.117,2887.718,"Next slide, please.",96,,
527,0.97,2887.718,2903.934,"So, the next couple of slides to show the Sdot project list and I just want to note that issue two and three, I provide a summary of the bridge and vision zero spending to provide additional context to this conversation.",96,,
528,0.97,2903.934,2913.143,"So, this first slide shows the $75 million of proposed, not proposed, but identified bridge projects.",96,,
529,0.97,2913.143,2927.991,"There are eight projects in total in the spending is spread out over the next five years, which if pursued would provide time for Sdot to move from project development and finished design.",96,,
530,0.97,2927.991,2933.263,"These are total estimated project costs and in developing this project list, Sdot did not rely on external grant funding.",96,,
531,0.97,2933.263,2937.534,I think I see a question.,96,,
532,0.97,2937.534,2940.57,Councilmember Herbold.,97,,
533,0.97,2940.57,2945.842,You are still on mute.,97,,
534,0.97,2945.842,2948.145,We are limiting ourselves to clarifying questions at this point?,98,,
535,0.97,2948.145,2956.987,"I think if your hand or comment was more related to weighing in on the options, then I might wait for us to get through the full slide.",99,,
536,0.97,2956.987,2965.162,"Yeah, I think my comment is more granular than the options.",100,,
537,0.97,2965.162,2967.397,It is more to do with the projects on the list.,100,,
538,0.97,2967.397,2968.598,"Yeah, go ahead, please.",101,,
539,0.97,2968.598,2968.999,Thanks.,102,,
540,0.97,2968.999,2984.214,"I just want to note, of course, the freeway which connects the bridge, the Peninsula.",102,,
541,0.97,2984.214,3000.697,"The Viaduct, and the rest of the road heading East toward I- 5. these are proposed for projects for 2022 and 2023 and 2024.",102,,
542,0.97,3000.697,3012.042,"The impression from the questions that we submitted to Sdot, that these projects would require road and Lane closures.",102,,
543,0.97,3012.042,3027.924,"I just want to say for the record, if the option that moves forward, related to pursuing bond financing for bridges, I would like to take a look at this list.",102,,
544,0.97,3027.924,3044.374,I really feel that West Seattle needs a break and I think I would like to make sure that we keep the roadway open and free from closures as much as possible for the next few years.,102,,
545,0.97,3044.374,3044.775,Thanks.,102,,
546,0.97,3044.775,3047.577,"Thank you, Councilmember.",103,,
547,0.97,3047.577,3063.26,"I think the policy option before you is really, do you want to continue using this funding for operational funding or do you want to divert to a capital program and then work through the details of what the capital program might look like?",103,,
548,0.97,3063.26,3076.273,And this is one option that identified projects that Sdot is aware of and we can work to move things around if that is the direction Council goes.,103,,
549,0.97,3076.273,3077.607,"Chair, may I?",104,,
550,0.97,3077.607,3081.711,"Yes, go ahead.",105,,
551,0.97,3081.711,3097.994,"I know this is how it was framed in the spring, because we created this additional funding and then, as we like to say, a robust debate about how to invest those dollars.",106,,
552,0.97,3097.994,3110.14,"Even though that is how it was framed before, because we have the new money and it was a relatively small amount of money, now we have the full $700 million budget, so I don't think it is either or.",106,,
553,0.97,3110.14,3117.747,"It could be yes and, depending on how we unpack the entire budget.",106,,
554,0.97,3117.747,3120.15,I appreciate seeing these numbers on the screen for potential projects.,106,,
555,0.97,3120.15,3131.061,I am disappointed that the administration did not choose to fund them or provide a way to fund them.,106,,
556,0.97,3131.061,3143.473,"We know there are ways to fund them, such as issuing bonds, but we want to be careful how we pay for the bonds, so we are not taking away from other programs.",106,,
557,0.97,3143.473,3146.476,There may be a way to do that as we continue budget discussions.,106,,
558,0.97,3146.476,3146.776,Thank you.,106,,
559,0.97,3146.776,3147.878,"Next slide, please.",107,,
560,0.97,3147.878,3157.087,This slide shows the $25 million of Non-Bridge projects that Sdot identified.,107,,
561,0.97,3157.087,3157.487,Nine projects.,107,,
562,0.97,3157.487,3159.556,Similarly these are spread out over the next three years.,107,,
563,0.97,3159.556,3164.394,"Generally smaller projects, not as complicated as the bridge projects.",107,,
564,0.97,3164.394,3177.207,"As part of the response to the request, they only identified projects that were eligible for bond financing, so they only included projects with a life over 20 years.",107,,
565,0.97,3177.207,3193.423,"I mentioned previously that the next couple of items will cover what is in the spending, but if there are any other questions, I can move on.",107,,
566,0.97,3193.423,3195.292,"I am not seeing any hands, Calvin.",108,,
567,0.97,3195.292,3200.73,"Next slide, please.",109,,
568,0.97,3200.73,3203.433,So the next issue for discussion is the bridge infrastructure spending.,109,,
569,0.97,3203.433,3215.645,"In 2020, the city completed a report on the bridge maintenance program and that made recommendations for business process improvements, which Sdot is implementing.",109,,
570,0.97,3215.645,3229.125,"The report identified an ongoing need for $34 million per year for bridge maintenance, based on the assumption that annual maintenance should be 1% of the total replacement cost of the asset.",109,,
571,0.97,3229.125,3237.334,The report found the average spending on bridge maintenance from 2006 to 2019 was $6.6 million per year.,109,,
572,0.97,3237.334,3247.077,"Calculating this figure, the audit focused only on routine maintenance programs and excluded asset preservation programs such as seismic upgrades.",109,,
573,0.97,3247.077,3247.711,And bridge replacements.,109,,
574,0.97,3247.711,3253.149,The next slide summarizes the total proposed capital and operating programs related to bridges.,109,,
575,0.97,3253.149,3253.583,"Next slide, please.",109,,
576,0.97,3253.583,3256.987,"So, this table --",109,,
577,0.97,3256.987,3261.791,"Sorry, let's do one issue at a time if we can.",110,,
578,0.97,3261.791,3263.627,If we can go back one slide real quick.,110,,
579,0.97,3263.627,3273.47,"Do you mind backing up one more, so we can have kind of concluding thoughts on the first issue I.D .?",110,,
580,0.97,3273.47,3280.01,"Councilmember 1027, did you have--Oh, you are still on mute.",110,,
581,0.97,3280.01,3280.61,Thank you.,111,,
582,0.97,3280.61,3285.081,It was actually the one about the bridge maintenance piece from the audit.,111,,
583,0.97,3285.081,3290.12,"I wanted to provide--Yeah, that slide.",111,,
584,0.97,3290.12,3291.254,$34 million was the low-end.,111,,
585,0.97,3291.254,3304.534,"The auditor had a range saying on the low-end, $34 million annually and up to $102 million annually, with 1 to 3% of total asset value of bridges.",111,,
586,0.97,3304.534,3317.947,Some folks would take the midpoint of the $34 million and $102 million and just say $68 million is what the ongoing repair maintenance cost for the investments would Ideally be.,111,,
587,0.97,3317.947,3319.949,If we had those resources.,111,,
588,0.97,3319.949,3325.055,Thank you.,111,,
589,0.97,3325.055,3325.855,Thank you.,112,,
590,0.97,3325.855,3335.265,"Calvin, I'm sorry to interrupt you, I just wanted to make sure we are following along with the issue identification.",112,,
591,0.97,3335.265,3336.666,That you have included in your memo.,112,,
592,0.97,3336.666,3349.245,"So if folks at additional comments before we move on to the infrastructure piece, where there are additional comments or questions people had on issue i.d., number one, and the options?",112,,
593,0.97,3349.245,3349.979,"Okay, great.",112,,
594,0.97,3349.979,3351.081,"Thanks, Calvin.",112,,
595,0.97,3351.081,3355.151,Sorry about that and please continue.,112,,
596,0.97,3355.151,3355.952,"Thank you, chair.",113,,
597,0.97,3355.952,3359.189,I appreciate you holding me --,113,,
598,0.97,3359.189,3360.256,"No, you are doing great.",114,,
599,0.97,3360.256,3366.096,"I know there is a lot of context, so thanks for walking us through it all.",114,,
600,0.97,3366.096,3368.098,Will you turn to the next slide?,114,,
601,0.97,3368.098,3369.365,Thank you.,114,,
602,0.97,3369.365,3376.072,This table shows only programmatic spending on bridges in the proposed budget.,114,,
603,0.97,3376.072,3379.109,"This is programmatic spending, so the West Seattle bridge, for example, is not included.",114,,
604,0.97,3379.109,3382.912,You can see the bulk of spending is tied to the Timeline which expires in 2024.,114,,
605,0.97,3382.912,3396.559,The program that Councilmember Pedersen mentioned earlier funds currently nine bridges as a deliverable of the Seattle levy with this particular line item.,114,,
606,0.97,3396.559,3408.338,"At the bottom half of the table we only show operational spending, but these programs are expected to be ongoing and funded in future projects.",114,,
607,0.97,3408.338,3413.443,These cover operations and maintenance for all of the bridge and structures division.,114,,
608,0.97,3413.443,3417.58,"This includes other functions not tied to bridges, such as engineering support for other projects.",114,,
609,0.97,3417.58,3428.658,In the proposed budget there is a proposal to add $5.2 million for bridge capital spending to fund repairs on bridges.,114,,
610,0.97,3428.658,3445.341,"The budget includes $1.9 million from the money we discussed earlier for bridge maintenance, which largely replaced what was a one-time, $2 million general fund add the Council added in the adopted budget.",114,,
611,0.97,3445.341,3453.483,Are there any questions on this issue?,114,,
612,0.97,3453.716,3458.121,"Please go ahead, Councilmember Pedersen.",115,,
613,0.97,3458.121,3471.601,"Just to clarify, you might have mentioned this, but item D, that does not include the Seattle levy items for Ballard bridge and Fremont bridge, correct?",116,,
614,0.97,3471.601,3475.004,That is correct.,117,,
615,0.97,3475.004,3483.78,It is the ones approved by the Re-Assessment from 2020 or 2019.,117,,
616,0.97,3483.78,3485.415,I can't remember when the realignment happened.,117,,
617,0.97,3485.415,3487.984,There were two phases of that.,117,,
618,0.97,3487.984,3496.125,"Okay, thank you.",118,,
619,0.97,3496.125,3498.528,"With no other questions, go to the next slide, thank you.",119,,
620,0.97,3498.528,3499.796,Thank you.,120,,
621,0.97,3499.796,3505.635,"Again, to provide additional context, it is vision zero spending.",121,,
622,0.97,3505.635,3516.246,Vision zero was the city goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries on city streets by 2030.,121,,
623,0.97,3516.246,3522.518,"It is a safety goal for both Sdot and the traveling public and because it is an Overarching vision, it can be difficult to point out the related capital spending.",121,,
624,0.97,3522.518,3532.829,"Many individual projects, like the Georgetown South Park trail are fundamentally vision zero projects, but it does include programs dedicated to implementing improvements.",121,,
625,0.97,3532.829,3539.969,"So, on the next slide I have provided a summary of proposed spending for the CIP projects.",121,,
626,0.97,3539.969,3552.382,"Once again, this only shows secured funding in the CIP and spending reflects why it is on Seattle levy, similar to the bridge projects.",121,,
627,0.97,3552.382,3560.69,There is only one project actually named for vision zero and it focuses on the high- traffic Arterials with the highest number of crashes.,121,,
628,0.97,3560.69,3571.267,"That is in row A. the neighborhood traffic control program, focuses for calming on Non-Arterial streets.",121,,
629,0.97,3571.267,3572.902,There are two budget programs.,121,,
630,0.97,3572.902,3582.946,"Item C and D. large products and the street Fund, which funds projects selected by the community.",121,,
631,0.97,3582.946,3591.588,"Those are not currently accepting new requests, but they are funding projects already identified and in the Queue for delivery.",121,,
632,0.97,3591.588,3598.294,"Then the remaining projects that are listed, the master plan and bike master plan.",121,,
633,0.97,3598.294,3621.751,"I wanted to note for both the vision zero programs and the bridge programs, and actually Sdot in general, with move Seattle expiring in 2024, thinking through what a proposal might look like is the next major opportunity to contemplate major shifts in spending priorities.",121,,
634,0.97,3621.751,3643.172,We have leveraged a lot of transportation revenues and we are coming up on a time where we can dramatically rethink or Re-Prioritize spending for another window if we go forward with the proposed renewal.,121,,
635,0.97,3643.172,3649.278,I will stop here if there are any questions on this slide.,121,,
636,0.97,3649.278,3650.079,Thank you.,122,,
637,0.97,3650.079,3651.881,"Council members, any questions?",122,,
638,0.97,3651.881,3656.986,"Okay, I am not seeing any.",122,,
639,0.97,3656.986,3657.22,Calvin.,122,,
640,0.97,3657.22,3660.256,"Next slide, please.",123,,
641,0.97,3660.256,3666.029,Issue number four is infrastructure funding.,124,,
642,0.97,3666.029,3671.601,Of great interest to all of us is the infrastructure bill which passed in August.,124,,
643,0.97,3671.601,3680.71,"That bill has $1.2 trillion for transportation, utility, and Internet investments on this included the Re-Authorization of the Act.",124,,
644,0.97,3680.71,3691.32,"The funding proposal covers five years, 2022 through 2026, but it requires passage in the house before becoming law.",124,,
645,0.97,3691.32,3693.823,Most of the funding would flow through existing grant programs and allocations.,124,,
646,0.97,3693.823,3702.699,So we will need to monitor those program requirements as the Federal agencies roll them out.,124,,
647,0.97,3702.699,3710.406,"Sdot has experience in securing Federal funds, most recently for Madison and the West Seattle bridge.",124,,
648,0.97,3710.406,3719.549,Some of the projects we may want to put forth need designed to be eligible and competitive for these grounds.,124,,
649,0.97,3719.549,3721.551,Councilmember Pedersen.,125,,
650,0.97,3721.551,3729.258,"My office did, I did speak with the staff at the D.C.",126,,
651,0.97,3729.258,3734.764,Office and community staff.,126,,
652,0.97,3734.764,3743.539,"One of our senators, Cantwell, to get an understanding of the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill.",126,,
653,0.97,3743.539,3764.66,"The good news is, that includes a small bridge, competitive grant program and they did confirm that the city having local dollars to match would put us in a highly competitive position.",126,,
654,0.97,3764.66,3769.065,Compared to other cities we have a lot of bridges and we have a lot of smaller bridges.,126,,
655,0.97,3769.065,3774.203,"At is another, trying to pitch the concept.",126,,
656,0.97,3774.203,3783.913,There is a real opportunity with this Federal bill to put together local matching dollars.,126,,
657,0.97,3783.913,3788.518,It is true that Sdot had recent success in getting things funded.,126,,
658,0.97,3788.518,3795.558,Part of that I believe is the West Seattle bridge emergency we had.,126,,
659,0.97,3795.558,3802.031,"I think everyone recognized it was an emergency, so we were able to get matching funds.",126,,
660,0.97,3802.031,3817.647,I wanted to just note that one of the authors of this bill is saying that having a local funding match would put us in a more competitive position for a local small bridge program.,126,,
661,0.97,3817.647,3817.947,Thank you.,126,,
662,0.97,3817.947,3821.284,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",127,,
663,0.97,3821.284,3828.424,I want to echo your appreciation for congressional delegations.,127,,
664,0.97,3828.424,3832.662,"And our Seattle delegation, who have been working on that.",127,,
665,0.97,3832.662,3849.612,I also want to echo their strong support for continuation of congressional direction and discretion so they can identify projects like this and be able to maintain that at the central level.,127,,
666,0.97,3849.612,3850.78,Something they have been fighting for.,127,,
667,0.97,3850.78,3864.093,"So I appreciate their work on that and I also want to emphasize the importance of passing the traditional infrastructure bill, for both bridges and roads, along with human infrastructure with the build back better act.",127,,
668,0.97,3864.093,3869.799,I think that is a conversation our congressional members are having right now.,127,,
669,0.97,3869.799,3882.078,"I appreciate leadership on that, so hopefully we will be able to enact infrastructure for roads, bridges, and families across our city soon.",127,,
670,0.97,3882.078,3889.986,Thank you for raising this and we will continue to look for updates on how that moves.,127,,
671,0.97,3889.986,3902.531,"If there is anything from your conversations with senators as well, Councilmember Pedersen that we should be doing to show support broadly, I am happy to work with you as well.",127,,
672,0.97,3902.531,3904.8,To send those messages.,127,,
673,0.97,3904.8,3906.736,Did you still have your hand up?,127,,
674,0.97,3906.736,3908.237,Okay.,127,,
675,0.97,3908.237,3909.238,Great.,127,,
676,0.97,3909.238,3918.814,"Council President Gonzalez, anything from you?",127,,
677,0.97,3918.814,3933.429,"I was going to suggest and Calvin, maybe you have done that, but have you had Cordination with folks at the office of relations on this issue and perhaps you could share a little bit more about conversations you had that might be relevant to this discussion?",128,,
678,0.97,3933.429,3940.503,"I have had conversations, mostly to confirm what I prepared in the memo and mentioned here.",129,,
679,0.97,3940.503,3943.572,I think it is fluid.,129,,
680,0.97,3943.572,3947.576,We are all waiting to see what comes out and gets approved into law.,129,,
681,0.97,3947.576,3965.261,"I think there may be options for a congressional delegation to identify specific needs that may come into play, but the vast majority of the money will rely on existing programs, which we do have some history of securing funding.",129,,
682,0.97,3965.261,3973.269,Typically those require local match of some amount to demonstrate that you have a real project.,129,,
683,0.97,3973.269,3991.52,"I think one of the key things that maybe will come up again later in my paper, getting sort of projects developed enough where we are confident of the costs, confident of the scope.",129,,
684,0.97,3991.52,4007.136,"That helps with project requests and grant requests, because we are clear that we have a clearly defined project and firm cost estimates and a plan for how to move forward.",129,,
685,0.97,4007.136,4015.244,So I do think the part of this is trying to figure out when will the granting agencies make this money available?,129,,
686,0.97,4015.244,4021.217,The budget is proposed to be available over five fiscal years.,129,,
687,0.97,4021.217,4022.818,Some of the money does rollover.,129,,
688,0.97,4022.818,4029.759,"You get into the Queue and then you get to the place where you get to the board, many years later.",129,,
689,0.97,4029.759,4043.539,I think there is a lot that needs to be done Upfront to get a project list developed that could be eligible for funding.,129,,
690,0.97,4043.539,4047.543,"Okay, I think if we can move to the next slide, please.",129,,
691,0.97,4047.543,4052.481,"Council President, anything else on that?",130,,
692,0.97,4052.481,4053.582,"Okay, great question.",130,,
693,0.97,4053.582,4081.043,"Thank you, for the work you have done on coordinating with our office of Intergovernmental relations and we look forward to standing at the ready to help in anyway and again, sending our appreciation to the delegation and congressional representatives for all they are trying to do in the Senate and House, to make sure these bills are all passed together and we get the infrastructure funding.",130,,
694,0.97,4081.043,4081.343,Thank you.,130,,
695,0.97,4081.343,4086.816,Thank you.,131,,
696,0.97,4086.816,4101.297,"Issue five is the proposition one transit service, so as a reminder for everyone, Seattle voters renewed proposition one in 2020 ended authorized to 0.15% sales tax for transit service and transit related programs.",131,,
697,0.97,4101.297,4119.315,"The proposed budget increases the transit service purchase from 2020 from King County Metro by about $7.7 million, a total of $28.5 million of transit service, roughly equivalent to 150,000 bus service hours.",131,,

705,0.97,4155.985,4164.994,The reserves are also there to manage he program over the entirety of the measure.,131,,

711,0.97,4214.143,4214.843,Councilmember Pedersen.,132,,
712,0.97,4214.843,4220.049,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",133,,
713,0.97,4220.049,4225.754,"Thank you, Calvin for mentioning the reserves.",133,,
714,0.97,4225.754,4226.755,Your memo is very thorough.,133,,
715,0.97,4226.755,4231.827,On page 11.,133,,
716,0.97,4231.827,4232.461,The $17 million.,133,,
717,0.97,4232.461,4235.464,Part of that was a holdover from the previous measure.,133,,
718,0.97,4235.464,4247.076,"One of the reasons Sdot gave, that I think you mentioned, was to allow for a gradual ramp down of transit services.",133,,
719,0.97,4247.076,4268.597,"I just feel that if we do want to ramp up, invest these transit dollars sooner, then I would think there would be room to do that without jeopardizing the future.",133,,
720,0.97,4268.597,4279.508,"Looking at the District and taking it, doing something King County wide, so that we go back to a regional approach.",133,,

722,0.97,4293.589,4299.928,See if we can do it regionally and if not we have the fallback position.,133,,
723,0.97,4299.928,4303.132,In Seattle there is such strong support.,133,,
724,0.97,4303.132,4317.546,"To me, the renewal risk is very minimal and yet right now we have a desire--a lot are writing us to do more with transit.",133,,
725,0.97,4317.546,4319.915,Let's expand in terms of frequency and reach of the bus system.,133,,
726,0.97,4319.915,4325.254,We have light rail stations opening and we have Emails from our office.,133,,
727,0.97,4325.254,4328.524,"Folks would like to see more frequency, getting to the light rail stations.",133,,
728,0.97,4328.524,4342.838,"So one of the things we may want to do during this process is take a hard look at the reserves, how much is needed and wouldn't it be nice to deploy more transit dollars now?",133,,
729,0.97,4342.838,4358.887,"The one thought I would put to you, is just remember, increasing transit service now, the expectation is that we would want to keep those services into the future, as well.",134,,
730,0.97,4358.887,4369.198,"So thinking about adding, using the reserves for a one time, please think about that, in terms of what the increased cost is for the next several years.",134,,
731,0.97,4369.198,4377.806,We would not want to ramp up the service in one year and then take it back.,134,,
732,0.97,4377.806,4385.614,So to kind of think through the overtime impact of adding service.,134,,
733,0.97,4385.614,4387.516,"But as I recall, you had a nice chart.",135,,
734,0.97,4387.516,4404.032,"This might have been part of the question and answer process, asking the agency to provide the spend plan not just for 2022, but the entire length and they were piling money into the reserves every year.",135,,
735,0.97,4404.032,4416.445,It seems like there could be a way of adding transit service from the reserves in a way that is sustainable.,135,,
736,0.97,4416.445,4425.621,This issue of ramp down risk in the final year I think is less of an issue.,135,,
737,0.97,4425.621,4435.364,"We either win King County ride or win in Seattle and you know, I would hate to hold back on Servicenow and there is such demand.",135,,
738,0.97,4435.364,4443.872,Having the intense frequency of buses.,135,,
739,0.97,4443.872,4447.743,To get people to consider getting out of their cars and the reliability of buses.,135,,
740,0.97,4447.743,4448.877,Just some thoughts.,135,,
741,0.97,4448.877,4453.649,Thanks.,135,,
742,0.97,4453.649,4457.453,It was a Sustainability issue I wanted to make sure was part of the conversation.,136,,
743,0.97,4457.453,4458.487,Thank you.,136,,
744,0.97,4458.487,4467.663,"Okay, Calvin, I am not seeing additional hands on this one.",137,,
745,0.97,4467.663,4469.498,"Excuse me, Council President, go ahead.",137,,
746,0.97,4469.498,4471.867,"Thank you, sorry for raising my hand so late.",138,,
747,0.97,4471.867,4485.714,"In response to your flag, Calvin, which is always a good one, you don't want to inadvertently create fiscal cliffs where they don't need to be, which I think is what you are flagging.",138,,
748,0.97,4485.714,4497.059,"Is there sort of an in between between, you know, status quo and what Councilmember Pedersen is proposing?",138,,
749,0.97,4497.059,4505.801,"In other words, is there a way to make an increase in transit service in 2022 that is more Scalable?",138,,
750,0.97,4505.801,4523.318,"So I am thinking, for example, in our conversation around the vehicle licensing fee, where we looked at how we can target some of those dollars towards essential workers, for example.",138,,
751,0.97,4523.318,4526.355,Providing them with reduced fares or free fares.,138,,
752,0.97,4526.355,4539.568,I am thinking about whether there is something similar to that kind of model that would allow us to have an increase of transit service in 2022.,138,,
753,0.97,4539.568,4548.377,That is Scalable in nature so as to avoid the fiscal cliff danger that you are identifying.,138,,
754,0.97,4548.377,4562.891,"I think it will take more work with the Department to dig in to the reserves, the plan reserves, and sort of work out what options might be and what it might look like.",139,,
755,0.97,4562.891,4567.195,It really does come down to funding.,139,,
756,0.97,4567.195,4579.808,We have an expected revenue stream tied to sales tax and I think--I don't know that there is not much else we can do.,139,,
757,0.97,4579.808,4590.118,"Aside from what the revenue policy may be, unless we are willing to consider other revenue sources.",139,,
758,0.97,4590.118,4596.825,"Got it, thank you.",140,,
759,0.97,4596.825,4600.429,"Seeing no more questions, next slide, please.",141,,
760,0.97,4600.429,4608.236,"So, issue number six is the streetcar and the existing streetcar system.",141,,
761,0.97,4608.236,4609.237,These are two separate issues.,141,,
762,0.97,4609.237,4615.544,I think they inform each other.,141,,
763,0.97,4615.544,4618.347,It includes project relevant on the Connector.,141,,
764,0.97,4618.347,4625.354,This would connect the existing Southlake car to downtown Seattle.,141,,
765,0.97,4625.354,4636.064,"Prior to the pandemic, council authorized $9 million to assess the project and problems with the vehicle design.",141,,
766,0.97,4636.064,4641.336,"With the pandemic, council directed those to other priorities for this project was put on hiatus.",141,,
767,0.97,4641.336,4655.584,The proposed 2.4 million would allow Sdot to assess how it proceeds with the project including eligibility for Federal grants and potential conflicts with the downtown tunnel alignment for the West Seattle extension.,141,,
768,0.97,4655.584,4658.186,The proposed funding is general fund using tax revenue.,141,,
769,0.97,4658.186,4669.164,"So as an option, council may now want to restart the project and then Repurpose the funding.",141,,
770,0.97,4669.164,4682.177,The proposed budget also includes $5.3 million to operate existing first Hill and South Union streetcars and this is the contribution to the total cost of operations which will be about $14 million in 2022.,141,,
771,0.97,4682.177,4687.849,It does rely on fares and contributions to fund operations.,141,,
772,0.97,4687.849,4696.792,"External contributions will expire over the next few years, so the contributions are expected to increase over time to make up the difference.",141,,
773,0.97,4696.792,4704.733,"As with other funds of transit, Ridership is recovering, but the ultimate pace is unknown.",141,,
774,0.97,4704.733,4717.112,"The proposed budget assumes the streetcar will raise $1.6 million fare revenue in 2022, which is close to the $1.8 million collected before the pandemic in 2019.",141,,
775,0.97,4717.112,4723.151,"If Ridership recovers slower than anticipated, streetcar service may require additional public subsidy or reductions in service.",141,,
776,0.97,4723.151,4733.061,I will pause for any questions.,141,,
777,0.97,4733.061,4736.364,"Councilmembers, any questions?",142,,
778,0.97,4736.364,4741.269,"Okay, Councilmember Pedersen, go ahead.",142,,
779,0.97,4741.269,4757.686,"In terms of $2.4 million, I was just looking at the capital improvement program part of our budget and there was the central city Connector with its own page in the budget.",143,,
780,0.97,4757.686,4770.098,"If there were a study and there was the option to go forward, I mean, there are a lot of sunk costs already in this project.",143,,
781,0.97,4770.098,4782.177,"Then I believe it would be about $165 million or more that would have to be spent and that is for the capital element, not the operating subsidy.",143,,
782,0.97,4782.177,4803.632,"So you know, I think I have been consistent with my concerns about this particular project being redundant with other modes of transportation along that corridor with the light rail and buses and other options that are available.",143,,
783,0.97,4803.632,4810.739,"As I recall, this is not a move Seattle levy project.",143,,
784,0.97,4810.739,4815.41,There are lots of unfulfilled promises with move Seattle.,143,,
785,0.97,4815.41,4817.445,"The bridge upgrades I mentioned, for example.",143,,
786,0.97,4817.445,4825.587,"I am concerned that this project--well, I will stop there.",143,,
787,0.97,4825.587,4827.823,Councilmember Herbold.,143,,
788,0.97,4827.823,4831.66,Councilmember Pedersen.,144,,
789,0.97,4831.66,4832.26,Councilmember Herbold.,144,,
790,0.97,4832.26,4845.674,"I want to add for clarification purposes, the CIP entry for this project lists $92 million in unsecured funding.",145,,
791,0.97,4845.674,4849.945,It says Sdot will continue to work with the Mayor's office and city Council to determine the future of the project.,145,,
792,0.97,4849.945,4857.052,"Separately, the CIP entry notes $50 million in Federal funding from 2023 as secured.",145,,
793,0.97,4857.052,4872.467,I had put in a question to Sdot about Federal funding in the budget office reply acknowledges that the grant was never awarded.,145,,
794,0.97,4872.467,4879.007,Sdot holds no grant funds associated with this grant.,145,,
795,0.97,4879.007,4883.478,"The $50 million lapsed at the end of the fiscal year, September 30, 2021.",145,,
796,0.97,4883.478,4898.093,So there is not $50 million in Federal funding secured and I know the director feels confident in his planned efforts to secure Federal funding.,145,,
797,0.97,4898.093,4913.108,"I think it is really important to know where the match from the Federal Government stands at this point, because that has really been a driver of some of our decisions in the past.",145,,
798,0.97,4913.108,4925.12,"The fact that we didn't have the money in hand, but the funds have been approved.",145,,
799,0.97,4925.12,4935.764,"So I think it is really important to consider that, when we are considering investing more dollars in studying this option.",145,,
800,0.97,4935.764,4940.935,I agree with Councilmember Pedersen that that corridor is well served by transit.,145,,
801,0.97,4940.935,4956.051,"And the funding source, taxes, would be a great funding source for investing more deeply in some of our vision zero projects.",145,,
802,0.97,4956.051,4963.892,I would be really interested.,145,,
803,0.97,4963.892,4967.762,In looking at more pressing needs for those funds.,145,,
804,0.97,4967.762,4968.163,Thanks.,145,,
805,0.97,4968.163,4970.899,I did have a similar question about that.,146,,
806,0.97,4970.899,4975.303,Council President Gonzalez up next.,146,,
807,0.97,4975.303,4990.118,"Calvin, comments on where the city is actively seeking new funds for Federal opportunities or this and maybe piling on to what Councilmember Herbold noted.",146,,
808,0.97,4990.118,5001.029,Does that mean the total amount of lapsed spending is actually $57.3 million that we have not been able to utilize that has been allocated to the city from our Federal partners?,146,,
809,0.97,5001.029,5004.632,I know there is no outstanding grant money as Councilmember Herbold mentioned.,147,,
810,0.97,5004.632,5010.605,It has lapsed.,147,,
811,0.97,5010.605,5021.549,There was a grant for vehicle procurement and that was funding that led to some of the reevaluating of the project two years ago.,147,,
812,0.97,5021.549,5023.151,That grant has lapsed.,147,,
813,0.97,5023.151,5027.255,We did not spend it.,147,,
814,0.97,5027.255,5029.057,Currently there are no outstanding grants.,147,,
815,0.97,5029.057,5047.175,"The project still maintains its eligibility for future grants programs, so it is still being reported and has active grants application in, but there are no current awards.",147,,
816,0.97,5047.175,5057.886,"There is no current award and then just a follow-up, is there active seeking of additional Federal dollars happening right now that we know of?",148,,
817,0.97,5057.886,5067.695,"I think beyond maintaining the eligibility in the small starts program, that is the only effort I am aware of.",149,,
818,0.97,5067.695,5083.678,"To the extent that the new infrastructure bill, if it passes and provides more money to that program, then presumably there would be more Federal money available through that existing program, but I am not available--I am not aware of any other grant search activity.",149,,
819,0.97,5083.678,5084.913,Thanks.,150,,
820,0.97,5084.913,5085.914,"Council President, please go ahead.",150,,
821,0.97,5085.914,5103.231,"I would also be interested in hearing a little bit more about, you know, understanding that Sdot is actively pursuing particular grants.",151,,
822,0.97,5103.231,5134.529,"I think it would be helpful to get an understanding of your perspective of opportunity in that area, for grants to continue to advance the vision related to the streetcar Connector and so I hope, Calvin, that you are able, after today's meeting, to go and talk to Sdot about what they are thinking might be available.",151,,
823,0.97,5134.529,5145.673,So that we have a better sense and context for what the realm of possibility might be to address that gap in the existing project.,151,,
824,0.97,5145.673,5150.912,"I do want to address, really quickly, a couple of comments made by my colleagues.",151,,
825,0.97,5150.912,5165.393,Councilmembers Pedersen and Herbold as it relates to redundancy or areas already well served by transit.,151,,
826,0.97,5165.393,5174.102,"I want to remind us that literature in the area of transportation, dating back to the early 80s, repeatedly tells us that redundancy should be a feature of all transit systems.",151,,
827,0.97,5174.102,5181.809,"Especially in mid to large cities, because that is what makes the network and system function really well.",151,,
828,0.97,5181.809,5211.739,"So I want to make sure that we are focused on good practices and on the expert literature that really does talk about how critically important it is for transit systems to have redundancy, because if one part of the system goes out during an emergency or for whatever other reason, that creates real pressure on people being able to access service.",151,,
829,0.97,5248.977,5253.781,Redundancy is a feature not a bug in transit systems.,152,,
830,0.97,5253.781,5257.685,I wanted to lift that up.,152,,
831,0.97,5257.685,5263.791,As we continue to debate.,153,,
832,0.97,5263.791,5267.862,As we continue to debate these limited resources and transit system.,154,,
833,0.97,5267.862,5271.299,Appreciate that Council President.,155,,
834,0.97,5271.299,5275.403,"Councilmember Pedersen, please go ahead.",155,,
835,0.97,5275.403,5279.073,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,156,,
836,0.97,5279.073,5281.509,A couple points on this.,156,,
837,0.97,5281.509,5287.215,"Right now there is a light rail and a bus, as transit options.",156,,
838,0.97,5287.215,5292.453,"I think there is some redundancy, positive redundancy there now.",156,,
839,0.97,5292.453,5308.136,"I agree with Councilmember Gonzalez, to have that, I am just concerned about additional cost with the other needs that we have.",156,,
840,0.97,5308.136,5311.939,"Having a third item, such a high cost.",156,,
841,0.97,5311.939,5328.156,"And Calvin said you do check in about what the chances are, with Federal funding, for this, going forward, it is not secure at this point.",156,,
842,0.97,5328.156,5333.461,"Asking what the status is, I understand the office of Inspector general, at the U.S.",156,,
843,0.97,5333.461,5342.036,Department of transportation but the project is still under active investigation by U.S.,156,,
844,0.97,5342.036,5342.437,D.O.T.,156,,
845,0.97,5342.437,5347.942,I do not know how that plays into our ability to get Federal funding.,156,,
846,0.97,5347.942,5353.381,If they are under federal investigation for the project.,156,,
847,0.97,5353.381,5363.057,"So, that is just something to throw in the mix, to see if it would be eligible just at this time, for funding.",156,,
848,0.97,5363.057,5368.963,I will definitely follow up with starting CBO with the current Federal funding.,157,,
849,0.97,5368.963,5378.806,I think the current intention with this 3.4 million was to rethink the strategy in general.,157,,
850,0.97,5378.806,5382.51,The project has not had significant work on the city side for a couple years now.,157,,
851,0.97,5382.51,5398.226,"I think that it is, I am not sure how much of a response it is going, how much approved response it will go right now.",157,,
852,0.97,5398.226,5399.827,Thank you.,158,,
853,0.97,5399.827,5401.496,Please go ahead President.,158,,
854,0.97,5401.496,5430.558,"Just quickly, I think the policy choice related to the center city streetcar is fielded by concerns related to whether or not we can effectively get those Federal grants that is one policy choice, but I think the, hoping to understand a little bit better from Us.For understanding.",159,,
855,0.97,5430.558,5433.327,It might be that they say that we don't have any good prospects.,159,,
856,0.97,5433.327,5436.33,But I think I have not heard that clearly or stated that unequivocally.,159,,
857,0.97,5436.33,5461.689,"If that is the case, then that is relevant information for us, as we, as we continue to identify ways to move through frankly, the pickle we are in as it relates to the center city streetcar Connector project.",159,,
858,0.97,5461.689,5469.263,"[Laughter] one way or another, you know, is this, did we sort of missed our opportunity here?",159,,
859,0.97,5469.263,5497.992,"Now we are in a position where we are once again delivering on a set of broken promises to members of the community who expected that we would have a connected system of streetcars from this center city, all the way to Chinatown International district.",159,,
860,0.97,5497.992,5519.046,"We have to sort of identify whether or not that is going to be another broken promise or whether we are going to come together with a clear plan on how we are going to secure the $50 million gap that has been identified through your work in the Department, and the departments work.",159,,
861,0.97,5519.046,5520.281,That is one set of questions.,159,,
862,0.97,5520.281,5525.353,The other set of questions is sort of the vision around what sort of transit network we want to create.,159,,
863,0.97,5525.353,5547.041,"And I get really concerned when we cite to existing bus and future light rail, the only amount of redundancy we should have is future light rail.",159,,
864,0.97,5547.041,5556.684,"I want to make sure that we are making decisions about what we want our Multi-Mobile transit at work to be by including things like streetcars, or bike lanes, or you know, good, safe sidewalks.",159,,
865,0.97,5556.684,5560.755,These are all report important redundancies for us to have.,159,,
866,0.97,5560.755,5580.408,"I agree that this area generally has access to good transit services, again, I don't think that we have sort of reached redundancy saturation as has been asserted in our conversation today.",159,,
867,0.97,5580.408,5586.514,"So I see there is a distinction between, can we fund these projects?",159,,
868,0.97,5586.514,5610.972,"And the policy question around what kind of transit network are we looking to create for this part of the city that will serve workers, visitors, and others in this area who are taking public transit? which is good for all of us because it reduces congestion downtown.",159,,
869,0.97,5610.972,5613.741,Thank you Council President.,160,,
870,0.97,5613.741,5628.356,"I will just underscore one question I asked earlier because it relates to what the President just stated again and then Councilmember Herbold closes this one and we will get to the last item, three items for identification here.",160,,
871,0.97,5628.356,5651.679,"Calvin, to that point, Council President Gonzalez just made again, I want to make sure that the expiration of the $7.3 million for the small starts grant, if that has expired and we also let the 50 million, that we originally received, expire, have we lost or are we in a worse position to get Federal grants in the future?",160,,
872,0.97,5651.679,5652.88,Politically I guess yes.,160,,
873,0.97,5652.88,5671.999,"Because when people continue to put time and energy and political capital into helping the city receive Federal funding and then have it not be put to use, I assume, like state legislative members, it is harder for them to continue to find funding for specific projects.",160,,
874,0.97,5671.999,5690.017,"But, you know, technically are we still eligible for all the other grants and is the loss of $50 million and the unused, expired $7.3 million called out in your memo here, are we still able to secure Federal grants for the project in the future?",160,,
875,0.97,5690.017,5694.321,That is a quick underscoring of the big question there.,160,,
876,0.97,5694.321,5698.626,"And if you don't have an answer now, that is fine too.",160,,
877,0.97,5698.626,5703.698,I have a couple thoughts I want to add.,161,,
878,0.97,5703.698,5718.712,"S.--S.D.O.T., with the efficiency argument of connecting the existing tree car lines, they think the project is score high, very well for the small start criteria.",161,,
879,0.97,5718.712,5720.114,I have no reason to argue that.,161,,
880,0.97,5720.114,5732.76,"I think compared to other public transit projects proposed around the country, that we probably score very well in terms of the land uses where it would support and Ridership would generate.",161,,
881,0.97,5732.76,5750.244,"But transit projects, one of the interesting things about the streetcar is we have a legacy of the South Lake Union streetcar, mostly an economic development tool for South Lake Union.",161,,
882,0.97,5750.244,5761.789,"And the first record which was, a way to connect first hill to the--when the transit station was eliminated from the system.",161,,
883,0.97,5761.789,5780.007,"So we had these two legacy projects that did not really, I do not think really fully internalized the ongoing cost that transit subsidy is required to run transit.",161,,
884,0.97,5780.007,5789.884,"That is what we are seeing now in amount of commercial parts, commercial parking tax revenue that we are providing to operate the systems.",161,,
885,0.97,5789.884,5806.0,"So I think the system is a good, scores well in terms of comparable FTA grants that are out there.",161,,
886,0.97,5806.0,5813.34,"I think it is as much a question of whether we have, do we have a financial plan that makes sense to us to support that or not?",161,,
887,0.97,5813.34,5816.644,I think that is the rub here.,161,,
888,0.97,5816.644,5840.034,"You know, politically I think if we have not taken action on the small starts grant, that maybe is not a great message for other funding sources or some of our other delegation partners, but in terms of the small starts grant itself, I think we are still in the Queue and it is more of a delay and not necessarily we have foregone the opportunity.",161,,
889,0.97,5840.034,5841.268,Gray.,162,,
890,0.97,5841.268,5849.176,"I want to double check before we move on, president did you have a follow-up?",162,,
891,0.97,5849.176,5852.346,I see your hand is still A. up.,162,,
892,0.97,5852.346,5852.947,No.,163,,
893,0.97,5852.947,5854.381,I forgot to lower my hand.,163,,
894,0.97,5854.381,5855.983,[Laughter],163,,
895,0.97,5855.983,5858.853,Thank you.,164,,
896,0.97,5858.853,5862.89,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",164,,
897,0.97,5862.89,5868.395,I want to go back to why we are talking about this $50 million in my I am talking about $50 million.,165,,
898,0.97,5868.395,5878.872,"I heard reference to $50 million gap, it is not a gap, it is a $140 million gap.",165,,
899,0.97,5878.872,5899.727,"For me the importance of the $50 million of the Federal funding in the discussion has always been for many, many years that we should continue to pursue this project and fill the gap between the full cost of the project because we had this $50 million.",165,,
900,0.97,5899.727,5908.736,"And so in my questioning whether we have the $50 million is to suggest the narrative that has been used for years, that we have secured Federal funding.",165,,
901,0.97,5908.736,5915.743,So we should look at filling the rest of the gap because we have such a substantial match.,165,,
902,0.97,5915.743,5930.557,"I am questioning that now . It is not to suggest we only have a $50 million gap, we have a $140 million gap, just none of the costs have gone up since the last time we had the conversation two years ago.",165,,
903,0.97,5930.557,5934.862,[Laughter],165,,
904,0.97,5934.862,5936.964,Okay.,166,,
905,0.97,5936.964,5943.737,"I was holding back on making a joke about redundancies, given your conversation.",167,,
906,0.97,5943.737,5945.973,[Laughter] too funny.,167,,
907,0.97,5945.973,5949.243,"Please go ahead, Calvin.",167,,
908,0.97,5949.243,5949.51,Okay.,168,,
909,0.97,5949.51,5952.479,"Next Sli, please.",168,,
910,0.97,5952.479,5955.783,Issue number seven is the integrated planning proposal.,168,,
911,0.97,5955.783,5956.05,S.D.O.T.,168,,
912,0.97,5956.05,5963.957,"Is planning to do a major overhaul of planning, integrating the plans into one common framework and document.",168,,
913,0.97,5963.957,5973.667,"They propose to do public outreach, concurrent with OPC D plan update and roll those together.",168,,
914,0.97,5973.667,5984.912,The total cost of the total of the transportation plan update is expected to be $4.5 Million- $5 million over the next few years.,168,,
915,0.97,5984.912,5992.286,"It as about $3 million in 2022 and they have about $500,000 of planning resources available.",168,,
916,0.97,5992.286,6000.327,This type of work would also help inform new levy proposal potentially for renewing Seattle.,168,,
917,0.97,6000.327,6011.905,As I mentioned before renewal planning would be an upgrade opportunity to reassess all of our transportation revenues and transportation priority spending.,168,,
918,0.97,6011.905,6015.809,Any questions?,168,,
919,0.97,6015.809,6019.246,Any questions on that?,169,,
920,0.97,6019.246,6022.449,I am not seeing any questions.,169,,
921,0.97,6022.449,6026.954,Let me ask one quick question here than.,169,,
922,0.97,6026.954,6029.323,Okay.,170,,
923,0.97,6029.323,6031.792,Let me pause to see if hands go up.,171,,
924,0.97,6031.792,6033.027,Okay.,171,,
925,0.97,6033.027,6051.845,"Is the 3 million available for the planning, can you tell me what the budget is, and similar to the conversations of authentic community engagement, is there any way to gauge if this is sufficient for the community outreach?",171,,
926,0.97,6051.845,6058.786,I will follow-up with my compatriot on the OPC side.,172,,
927,0.97,6058.786,6064.491,This might be something that will be a multiyear process.,172,,
928,0.97,6064.491,6075.302,So I think right now they recognize a big body of work but I don't believe the executive has a firm detailed work plan.,172,,
929,0.97,6075.302,6082.743,This could be something some direction from Council could help establish what you want to see.,172,,
930,0.97,6082.743,6087.014,And report back to Council.,172,,
931,0.97,6087.014,6090.05,"Okay, great, Calvin, thank you for walking us through this.",173,,
932,0.97,6090.05,6093.72,Anything else on the Sli?,173,,
933,0.97,6093.72,6094.021,All right.,173,,
934,0.97,6094.021,6095.088,Let's keep going.,173,,
935,0.97,6095.088,6097.791,"Next Sli, please.",174,,
936,0.97,6097.791,6101.762,Issue 8 is to highlight the S.D.O.T.,174,,
937,0.97,6101.762,6111.805,"Equities in the proposal budget, specific proposals to directly underscored communities.",174,,
938,0.97,6111.805,6114.541,There is funding for the eighth Avenue park as part of the action plan.,174,,
939,0.97,6114.541,6119.746,There is funding for the pedestrian and public space improvement in five specific targeted neighborhoods.,174,,
940,0.97,6119.746,6121.248,Part of the S.D.O.T.,174,,
941,0.97,6121.248,6124.351,Reset program.,174,,
942,0.97,6124.351,6134.127,Improvements to the detective cookie chess park and the equity Workgroup.,174,,
943,0.97,6134.127,6135.863,Wonderful.,175,,
944,0.97,6135.863,6136.864,Okay.,176,,
945,0.97,6136.864,6137.831,Next.,176,,
946,0.97,6137.831,6139.666,Great.,177,,
947,0.97,6139.666,6141.869,"Next Sli, Patty.",178,,
948,0.97,6141.869,6148.876,I think this should be Sli 9.,178,,
949,0.97,6148.876,6151.145,It says Sli 8 but it should be the ninth issue.,178,,
950,0.97,6151.145,6152.279,Covid response programs.,178,,
951,0.97,6152.279,6162.789,"To help accommodate social distancing and public space in the Right-Of-Way, S.D.O.T.",178,,
952,0.97,6162.789,6166.293,Has been rolling out a number of programs in response to the pandemic the past two years.,178,,
953,0.97,6166.293,6177.571,"The safe start cafe Street program allowed businesses to make structural improvements in the roadway, making space for food service and betting.",178,,
954,0.97,6177.571,6188.582,We are looking to make this improvement permanent in early 2022 over improvement but the budget does not include budget changes with that.,178,,
955,0.97,6188.582,6196.423,So presumably those proposals would come together with a proposal to Council.,178,,
956,0.97,6196.423,6203.997,"The stay healthy streets program built on the neighborhood Greenways program to encourage Nonmotorized use of streets, S.D.O.T.",178,,
957,0.97,6203.997,6209.636,"Is including some permanent improvements in Greenwood, beacon Hill and fell Street locations.",178,,
958,0.97,6209.636,6223.016,Making let the existing locations permanent in 2022 but not letting space for additional permits for streets.,178,,
959,0.97,6223.016,6242.836,"And the additional keep Seattle moving program, keeping streets closed near parks, including Greenlight way, Lake Washington Boulevard, Alki Pointe and golden Gardens, recently Greenlight way was reopened to traffic with a two-way shared path.",178,,
960,0.97,6242.836,6247.541,But the proposed budget does not include any funding for other permanent improvement in 2022.,178,,
961,0.97,6247.541,6250.143,To my knowledge Lake Washington Boulevard is Visioned as a summer program.,178,,
962,0.97,6250.143,6260.087,I believe the Alki points temporary closures are still in place and the Golden gardens closure is no longer being used.,178,,
963,0.97,6260.087,6261.622,Any questions?,178,,
964,0.97,6263.924,6268.495,Not seeing questions on this one.,179,,
965,0.97,6268.495,6269.796,Okay.,180,,
966,0.97,6269.796,6272.499,"Next Sli, please.",180,,
967,0.97,6272.499,6278.705,So there are two pieces of budget legislation transmitted with the budget.,180,,
968,0.97,6278.705,6281.308,The first is the car share ordinance.,180,,
969,0.97,6281.308,6287.514,This would change the permit fee structure in place for Free- floating car share.,180,,
970,0.97,6287.514,6290.584,It would move from a parking base cost model to a per trip model.,180,,
971,0.97,6290.584,6303.03,"This would reduce permit fees by about $150,000, under the current parking base model the program generates about $340,000 in the use fees.",180,,
972,0.97,6303.03,6305.766,There is also administrator fee that would continue to be collected under administration.,180,,
973,0.97,6305.766,6314.908,This would move to a per trip fee structure of $.50 per trip in a vehicle with internal combustion motor.,180,,
974,0.97,6314.908,6317.744,And $.25 per trip for electric vehicles.,180,,
975,0.97,6317.744,6320.447,The legislation will also authorize S.D.O.T.,180,,
976,0.97,6320.447,6325.919,To determine the equitable geographic coverage for Free- floating car share services.,180,,
977,0.97,6325.919,6336.763,Currently in the code we require that car share companies offer service across the entire city within two years of beginning operations.,180,,
978,0.97,6336.763,6339.366,So this proposed legislation would give S.D.O.T.,180,,
979,0.97,6339.366,6357.784,"Discretion to consider feasibility, Fleet size, specific areas with identified needs, the breath of service and the strategy to use to reach low-income customers.",180,,
980,0.97,6357.784,6373.533,"It is important to note that in 2019 the three companies that were offering these services in Seattle, ceased local operations and there is currently one new provider that is operating a fleet of 370 vehicles in Seattle.",180,,
981,0.97,6377.104,6379.873,Any questions on this legislation?,181,,
982,0.97,6379.873,6388.215,Can you remind me again why the three companies ceased operation here?,182,,
983,0.97,6388.215,6408.101,"This is just conjecture on my part but I think competition from Ride-Share, right Hailing services, other Micro-Mobility options and potentially the requirement to expand your service within two years to cover the entire city, may have played a role in their business decisions.",183,,
984,0.97,6408.101,6412.439,Thanks Calvin.,184,,
985,0.97,6412.439,6412.739,Okay.,184,,
986,0.97,6412.739,6414.608,"I am not seeing, excuse me, president, please go ahead.",184,,
987,0.97,6414.608,6422.849,I may have missed you saying this but who is the remaining care share provider?,185,,
988,0.97,6422.849,6427.254,The new company is called gig.,186,,
989,0.97,6427.254,6435.762,"We previously had car to go, reach go and line pod.",186,,
990,0.97,6435.762,6437.33,Right.,187,,
991,0.97,6437.33,6440.367,Right.,188,,
992,0.97,6440.367,6441.768,Okay.,188,,
993,0.97,6441.768,6459.786,"And so the ordinance we are being asked to consider I am trying to understand what the change here is forward, if any.",188,,
994,0.97,6459.786,6468.261,"You know, what is the programmatic effects, of the Council's adoption of the proposed budget legislation?",188,,
995,0.97,6468.261,6472.999,"So the, I think it really does two things.",189,,
996,0.97,6472.999,6480.907,"It reduces the cost to the permit holder of doing business, continuing business in Seattle.",189,,
997,0.97,6480.907,6483.176,"It reduces the fee by $150,000.",189,,
998,0.97,6483.176,6508.902,"The second thing it does is gives some discretion to S.D.O.T., to work with the Permittee to figure out what the appropriate coverage service requirements should be, without this change the code would require that a company that has been operating for two years has to demonstrate service is available for the entire city.",189,,
999,0.97,6508.902,6516.409,Beyond that I would have to get more feedback from the Department to understand where the discussions have been.,189,,
1000,0.97,6516.409,6521.848,But that was the genesis of the proposed legislation.,189,,
1001,0.97,6521.848,6524.351,Okay.,190,,
1002,0.97,6524.351,6539.866,"So, so than adopting the legislation would lift the requirement that there be more equitable geographic coverage of car share services?",190,,
1003,0.97,6539.866,6541.668,It would give S.D.O.T.,191,,
1004,0.97,6541.668,6555.982,"The discretion to consider a number of factors in determining whether the service provider was equitably delivered, as opposed to you must serve the entire city.",191,,
1005,0.97,6555.982,6560.387,Right.,192,,
1006,0.97,6560.387,6570.664,"I just want to for clarity purposes, the current requirement is you have to have geographic equity in these programs in exchange for being able to do business here, in this model.",192,,
1007,0.97,6570.664,6570.897,Right?,192,,
1008,0.97,6570.897,6572.098,That is the status quo.,192,,
1009,0.97,6572.098,6575.835,In this ordinance would give S.D.O.T.,192,,
1010,0.97,6575.835,6588.248,"The discretion to deviate from that and not require equitable geographic coverage, presumably because it is the intent.",192,,
1011,0.97,6593.32,6595.388,We just lost the Council Council President.,193,,
1012,0.97,6595.388,6600.694,"[Laughter] But I think you get her point, Calvin.",193,,
1013,0.97,6600.694,6602.128,I have the same question.,193,,
1014,0.97,6602.128,6604.431,I am happy to pitch in.,193,,
1015,0.97,6604.431,6609.235,Did you want to add anything Councilmember Morales?,194,,
1016,0.97,6609.235,6613.54,This is the piece I'm struggling with.,195,,
1017,0.97,6613.54,6619.045,"I think it would be helpful if we know, you know, what reasons the other companies really did leave.",195,,
1018,0.97,6619.045,6624.15,"And if this is the Reaon, what is behind it.",195,,
1019,0.97,6624.15,6634.728,"You know, was it really costing them more to try to operate citywide, or was it because there are regions of the city where they don't want to operate in?",195,,
1020,0.97,6634.728,6637.964,Is the real question.,195,,
1021,0.97,6637.964,6640.7,"And I, if we have the information, it would be helpful.",195,,
1022,0.97,6640.7,6644.17,I will be happy to engage S.D.O.T.,196,,
1023,0.97,6644.17,6646.172,And see what kind of information is available.,196,,
1024,0.97,6646.172,6658.084,"I am not, it is not, some of it can seem like hearsay when it comes to business reasons for why businesses choose to do what they do.",196,,
1025,0.97,6658.084,6661.921,But I will get an answer from S.D.O.T ..,196,,
1026,0.97,6664.524,6665.792,Thank you.,197,,
1027,0.97,6665.792,6672.198,And the resident is trying to get back Online here and I know she will appreciate that.,197,,
1028,0.97,6672.198,6679.305,"That line of question from Councilmember Morales, and your answer, Calvin.",197,,
1029,0.97,6679.305,6698.591,"This is anecdotal . I appreciate Calvin will track down more information but I remember taking a meeting from car to go a couple years ago, before they seized operations.",198,,
1030,0.97,6698.591,6708.435,"And they were taking my temperature for decisions they wanted to make, to get permission from S.D.O.T.",198,,
1031,0.97,6708.435,6713.54,To make a change in the ordinance.,198,,
1032,0.97,6713.54,6717.544,To allow them to no longer serve part of West Seattle.,198,,
1033,0.97,6717.544,6724.851,Because people were driving cars downtown but not bringing them back until the end of the day.,198,,
1034,0.97,6724.851,6730.857,Where as they like to see a lot of circulation of vehicles throughout the day.,198,,
1035,0.97,6730.857,6736.663,"So it just was a part of town that people were definitely using it, but they were not getting the frequency of coverage.",198,,
1036,0.97,6736.663,6742.869,And they wanted to stop serving that part of town.,198,,
1037,0.97,6742.869,6746.339,I definitely know it was a factor.,198,,
1038,0.97,6746.339,6751.444,"And we do, thank you Councilmember Herbold, for the additional context.",199,,
1039,0.97,6751.444,6755.782,We do have resident Gonzalez back.,199,,
1040,0.97,6755.782,6756.783,Anything you wanted to add?,199,,
1041,0.97,6756.783,6759.652,We are still on the same topic.,199,,
1042,0.97,6759.652,6761.488,Sorry about that.,200,,
1043,0.97,6761.488,6767.393,Turns out your computer will die if you don't plug it in.,200,,
1044,0.97,6767.393,6767.994,Sorry about that.,200,,
1045,0.97,6767.994,6782.208,"I think if I were picking up what Councilmember Herbold was laying down right now, I it Punctuates an example of what I am understanding the change to be.",200,,
1046,0.97,6782.208,6797.791,"I am concerned about creating this discretion because I do think it will create some significant inequities, in terms of geographic coverage.",200,,
1047,0.97,6797.791,6812.038,"Particularly for low income communities and also communities like West Seattle that may need to rely on this, given how difficult it is to move about on the peninsula currently.",200,,
1048,0.97,6812.038,6840.099,"So I would like to just get a little bit more Info about why we are both producing reducing the fee, and also eliminating the policy goal of requiring equitable geographic coverage of Free-Floating car share services.",200,,
1049,0.97,6840.099,6844.571,That does not seem like a good deal to the people of the city.,200,,
1050,0.97,6844.571,6849.676,And I have a lot of concerns about that.,200,,
1051,0.97,6849.676,6862.488,"So if we could hear a little bit more about intent and policy goals from S.D.O.T., that would be extraordinarily helpful to me in deciding whether or not I can support this budget legislation.",200,,
1052,0.97,6862.488,6865.491,Thank you.,200,,
1053,0.97,6865.491,6869.896,"Great, thank you all very much.",201,,
1054,0.97,6869.896,6872.665,"Calvin, I know you said you will look into it and chat with S.D.O.T.",201,,

1062,0.97,6885.745,6895.722,"There is also for the update of the ordinance, to update the service rates and permit fees.",202,,
1063,0.97,6895.722,6903.496,"While the cost of permit fees would generally increase, the proposal does include consolidating administration and filing fees that were previously charged separately.",202,,
1064,0.97,6903.496,6910.436,"The proposal also creates a new Street improvement light permit, less expensive permit for small improvement projects.",202,,
1065,0.97,6910.436,6919.846,"It also maintains the existing free permit programs for block Hardee's, safe streets, and similar types of programs.",202,,

1074,0.97,6949.275,6956.182,It creates a new Pathway for some smaller Street improvements.,204,,
1075,0.97,6956.182,6959.352,So right now everything kind of falls under the large Street improvement program.,204,,
1076,0.97,6959.352,6959.585,Permit.,204,,
1077,0.97,6959.585,6966.459,This Carves out a lesser cost for smaller scale improvements.,204,,

1147,0.97,7406.732,7415.307,"At this point, if there are no questions I will turn it to my colleagues to talk about alternatives to police response.",213,,
1148,0.97,7415.307,7420.045,Let's take a few questions before we get into the alternatives.,214,,
1149,0.97,7420.045,7423.716,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",214,,
1150,0.97,7423.716,7427.953,Not a question but a clarification.,215,,
1151,0.97,7427.953,7437.229,Asha mentioned that Midi briefing from the legal task force in my committee.,215,,
1152,0.97,7437.229,7445.638,"There was a prior briefing from central staffer who, what we brought on, to develop a strategic plan.",215,,
1153,0.97,7445.638,7455.281,And we also had a briefing in my committee with Carlos before he left.,215,,
1154,0.97,7455.281,7460.152,A Time-Limited position to develop a strategic plan.,215,,
1155,0.97,7460.152,7464.089,"He presented, I believe, it was maybe in July.",215,,
1156,0.97,7464.089,7466.325,And I just with that up because there is some differences.,215,,
1157,0.97,7466.325,7466.659,Right?,215,,
1158,0.97,7466.659,7483.309,"There are some differences between the strategic plan as developed by central staff and the recommendations of the criminal, legal system task force members.",215,,
1159,0.97,7483.309,7487.112,And there is a lot of alignment too.,215,,
1160,0.97,7487.112,7500.826,"But since Asha is lifting the task force recommendations, I did want to make sure we did not forget the great report that Carlos put together as well.",215,,
1161,0.97,7500.826,7506.532,"I think it is part of a whole, is how I would like to think of it.",215,,
1162,0.97,7506.532,7526.285,"When we think about the strategic plan, I think we should think of it again as a whole that includes both the task force recommendations and the, I don't know, the year, two years long work of the central staff and this product.",215,,
1163,0.97,7526.285,7528.487,Thank you very much.,216,,
1164,0.97,7528.487,7533.359,"Thanks for the context, Councilmember Herbold.",216,,
1165,0.97,7533.359,7536.896,I think we can go ahead and continue.,216,,
1166,0.97,7539.265,7542.568,Good morning.,217,,
1167,0.97,7542.568,7553.078,"Ann Gorman, my role is to walk through what we need by alternatives to police response to provide context or issue identification in the area.",217,,
1168,0.97,7553.078,7566.892,"We we talk alternatives to police response, broadly speaking we mean any response to an incident that is not 100% comprised of law enforcement.",217,,
1169,0.97,7566.892,7571.463,The response could have zero participation from law enforcement or it could be law enforcement with a civilian Responder.,217,,
1170,0.97,7571.463,7577.97,Typically this is someone who has training in mental and behavioral health.,217,,
1171,0.97,7577.97,7604.396,"Just to set the scene, the study alternatives police has expanded over the past several years in recognition of the fact that a large number of service calls do have a mental and behavioral component and that law enforcement response is not only inappropriate to some of these calls, but may actually compound the stress of people at the scene.",217,,
1172,0.97,7604.396,7622.948,"At the same time there are situations in which a law enforcement response is exactly what is needed and all of the alternatives that we are going to walk through today would have the effect of freeing up law enforcement, to concentrate on the work that they are uniquely trained and sworn to do.",217,,
1173,0.97,7622.948,7637.63,"So this Sli lists categories or elements to police response, but something we want to emphasize is anyone programmatic solution could weave together two or more categories.",217,,
1174,0.97,7637.63,7649.675,The first on the list is mobile integrated health . These are Nonemergency resources and treatment provided by a mobile care provider or providers.,217,,
1175,0.97,7649.675,7659.885,"Providers come to the scene, come to wherever they are, their goal is to meet the immediate need and move on.",217,,
1176,0.97,7659.885,7661.12,Potentially to serve someone else.,217,,
1177,0.97,7661.12,7666.892,Sometimes the person at the scene has a need that cannot be met right there and right then.,217,,
1178,0.97,7666.892,7675.701,Perhaps there is an underlying substance abuse issue or the person's underlying need is for shelter.,217,,
1179,0.97,7675.701,7683.809,In that case there is typically mental or behavioral health person on the scene that can help connect the person to services that will be of assistance in the future that they can provide referrals.,217,,
1180,0.97,7683.809,7700.392,"A couple different kinds of mobile integrated health, there is medical and Nonmedical mobile integrated health, the city currently has a medical Mih program, Healthone in the fire Department.",217,,
1181,0.97,7700.392,7714.64,"Two firefighters and a counselor from Hsd, they come to people and they provide the services they need.",217,,
1182,0.97,7714.64,7717.91,"In some cases referrals they need, and again, move on to the next two needs assistance.",217,,
1183,0.97,7717.91,7720.813,"All firefighters are Emts, so that is the Healthcare component of the model.",217,,
1184,0.97,7720.813,7735.761,"The city also has the Nonmedical Mih program, Council, crisis response unit, the responders are an officer with crisis intervention training and counselor from Hsd.",217,,
1185,0.97,7735.761,7746.271,"Typically, as in the Healthone program, the counselor can attend to the scene and then also make referrals to ongoing services.",217,,
1186,0.97,7746.271,7756.748,"The budget includes another medical Mih unit, triage one located in the fire Department as a complement to Healthone.",217,,
1187,0.97,7756.748,7767.392,"A couple key differences between Healthone and triage one, first of all the responders in the post program would only attend to the scene of Nonmedical, Nonemergency calls.",217,,
1188,0.97,7767.392,7778.37,Something to note here is that the program is acknowledging and Unknot made for--unmet need for adult health response.,217,,
1189,0.97,7778.37,7786.011,"Second, it includes the triage team responders responding to down calls and performing welfare checks.",217,,
1190,0.97,7786.011,7789.214,Healthone does not perform this work.,217,,
1191,0.97,7789.214,7801.126,Both of the bodies of work are currently in SPD and in 29 call types being analyzed for potential feasibility of civilian response.,217,,
1192,0.97,7801.126,7803.729,No decision yet on that from SPD.,217,,
1193,0.97,7803.729,7809.301,Please remind us of the Timeline for when we expect the decisions.,218,,
1194,0.97,7809.301,7812.938,I do not have the information yet but I will check on it and follow up.,219,,
1195,0.97,7812.938,7815.941,Table 1 on page 8 of the memo.,219,,
1196,0.97,7815.941,7820.145,Summarizes --,219,,
1197,0.97,7820.145,7828.32,"Council President, axes me, I am sorry to interrupt you Ann.",220,,
1198,0.97,7828.32,7836.061,"It is great to see you, but I did see Councilmember Herbold pop and really quick.",220,,
1199,0.97,7836.061,7842.467,We are probably jumping in for the same season.,221,,
1200,0.97,7842.467,7846.738,They are telling us end of quarter one.,221,,
1201,0.97,7846.738,7862.087,There is a discussion about whether or not we want them to do the 29 call types now and get that over with or to do the whole analysis of all 50% of call types that the report says may not be the response.,221,,
1202,0.97,7862.087,7872.898,They are telling us that they can do the big list as quickly as the smallest and they are saying they can get the report by the end of quarter one.,221,,
1203,0.97,7872.898,7886.078,"But I was somebody who was really wanting them to focus on that, the smaller numbers, since there was strong agreement that that was a number that we sort of, the low hanging fruit.",221,,
1204,0.97,7886.078,7895.621,But if we can actually confirm that they can do the big one in the same amount of time I don't have a problem with that.,221,,
1205,0.97,7895.621,7899.091,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,222,,
1206,0.97,7899.091,7907.032,"It would be ideal to get information before the budget process, but I appreciate how fast and hard you have been working with them to try to get the list.",222,,
1207,0.97,7907.032,7908.1,"Greg, good to see you again.",222,,
1208,0.97,7908.1,7909.034,Any additional context?,222,,
1209,0.97,7909.034,7909.501,Thanks.,223,,
1210,0.97,7909.501,7928.854,"Just one more Councilmember Herbold, in all my timing with police, I will call out that SPD will ask in the 2022 proposed budget to use 260,000 of the salary savings on development of the software to complete the project.",223,,
1211,0.97,7928.854,7930.722,So I just want to highlight that now.,223,,
1212,0.97,7930.722,7934.826,"So when I get to it this afternoon, you have a marker for it.",223,,
1213,0.97,7934.826,7935.56,Thanks.,223,,
1214,0.97,7935.56,7940.265,"Appreciate it, preview of a robust discussion to come this afternoon.",224,,
1215,0.97,7940.265,7945.37,I am glad we are starting with alternatives conversation and I apologize for the interruption.,224,,
1216,0.97,7945.37,7946.038,Please go ahead.,224,,
1217,0.97,7946.038,7948.473,All welcome information.,225,,
1218,0.97,7948.473,7958.684,"The memo also has information about the mobile crisis team, aching County program for which Council included Bunting in the 2021 adopted budget.",225,,
1219,0.97,7958.684,7961.887,The funding continues in the 2022 proposed budget.,225,,
1220,0.97,7961.887,7968.093,Are there any questions specific to mobile integrated health before I go on?,225,,
1221,0.97,7968.093,7971.096,This Definitional stuff takes a while.,225,,
1222,0.97,7971.096,7973.165,"Great, thank you for Pausing.",226,,
1223,0.97,7973.165,7976.668,I see a question from Councilmember Lewis.,226,,
1224,0.97,7976.668,7982.574,"Thank you Madam chair and Ann, thank you for getting us started here.",227,,
1225,0.97,7982.574,7993.285,"I want to ask quickly, at the beginning here, of these responses, what is and isn't a direct 911 Responder?",227,,
1226,0.97,7993.285,8006.131,"My understanding is the mobile integrated health team, they are a team that responds after a 911 first Responder gets there and flags them as someone to come out.",227,,
1227,0.97,8006.131,8007.132,Is that the case?,227,,
1228,0.97,8007.132,8014.139,I want to confirm what is a first Responder in the list and a secondary Responder.,227,,
1229,0.97,8014.139,8018.21,Healthone can also be directly dispatched.,228,,
1230,0.97,8018.21,8022.714,Based on the information that is conveyed in the 911 call.,228,,
1231,0.97,8022.714,8023.749,I know Healthone can.,229,,
1232,0.97,8023.749,8031.957,I was asking about the de SC crisis intervention.,229,,
1233,0.97,8031.957,8033.725,Those folks.,229,,
1234,0.97,8033.725,8040.866,I believe that team needs to be summoned to the scene by a first Responder.,230,,
1235,0.97,8040.866,8042.667,I can check on that and confirm.,230,,
1236,0.97,8042.667,8043.568,Thank you.,231,,
1237,0.97,8043.568,8045.37,Perfect.,231,,
1238,0.97,8045.37,8047.372,That is what I was seeking clarification on.,231,,
1239,0.97,8047.372,8048.673,I can get confirmation.,232,,
1240,0.97,8048.673,8056.782,The first responders can reach out to mobile crisis team to come in response to a call.,232,,
1241,0.97,8056.782,8068.393,There is a Pathway where the crisis connections or designated crisis Responder can also call on the mobile crisis team.,232,,
1242,0.97,8068.393,8068.994,There are other pathways.,232,,
1243,0.97,8068.994,8072.664,I think the one we are most familiar with is the first responders calling on-site.,232,,
1244,0.97,8072.664,8076.001,"Thank you Jeff, great to see you as well.",233,,
1245,0.97,8076.001,8079.905,Thank you from the earlier response from Greg.,233,,
1246,0.97,8079.905,8081.573,Anything else you wanted to add lise?,233,,
1247,0.97,8081.573,8082.407,I see one screen.,233,,
1248,0.97,8082.407,8085.61,"No, thank you.",234,,
1249,0.97,8085.61,8086.878,Good to see you too.,235,,
1250,0.97,8086.878,8087.512,It takes a team.,235,,
1251,0.97,8087.512,8088.213,Wonderful.,235,,
1252,0.97,8088.213,8091.383,Appreciate that Ann.,235,,
1253,0.97,8091.383,8096.121,Thank you for the question Councilmember Lewis.,235,,
1254,0.97,8096.121,8098.99,It is a great question Teeing up some of the first issue I.D.,235,,
1255,0.97,8098.99,8100.826,Issues that I think we will get to as well.,235,,
1256,0.97,8100.826,8102.227,I appreciate it.,235,,
1257,0.97,8102.227,8104.696,I will move on.,236,,
1258,0.97,8104.696,8110.936,Another type of alternative to police response is the civilization of officer functions.,236,,
1259,0.97,8110.936,8120.312,"Based on the structure of the triage one proposal, you can see it includes both items one and items two on the list.",236,,
1260,0.97,8120.312,8133.525,It has the Mih focus and includes civilization of officer function.,236,,
1261,0.97,8133.525,8143.034,"Officers other than responders, for participating in community meetings, and supporting city health programs.",236,,
1262,0.97,8143.034,8169.261,"We know many members of Bipoc communities are nervous and may make presence more welcome at events like this, in contrast to law enforcement officers.",236,,
1263,0.97,8169.261,8171.596,I know Greg will talk about the community service officers this afternoon.,236,,
1264,0.97,8171.596,8178.203,"Next item, administrative responses to service calls.",236,,
1265,0.97,8178.203,8183.108,It may be possible for civilians to take on some of the work.,236,,
1266,0.97,8183.108,8186.144,Administrative responses are things like taking reports of minor accidents and property distractions.,236,,
1267,0.97,8186.144,8200.191,"At the same time SPD is working on analysis of call types and central staff working with the city attorney's office to understand whether there are call types that require, by state law, law enforcement response.",236,,
1268,0.97,8200.191,8212.137,"And I should note for item 3, anytime we talk about transfer of work, we are talking about bargaining for the Union.",236,,
1269,0.97,8212.137,8222.147,"Crisis line can also be a alternative, a resource to people having a mental or behavioral health crisis.",236,,
1270,0.97,8222.147,8230.355,"People answering the phones provide advice, support, information, other numbers to call, to get more specialized help.",236,,
1271,0.97,8230.355,8235.961,"There are several of these operating in Seattle, including the one call pilot, which I believe Jeff referred to.",236,,
1272,0.97,8235.961,8242.867,That this emergency responders call crisis connections for help when they are unseen and someone is having a crisis.,236,,
1273,0.97,8242.867,8246.938,"There is $403,000 in the proposed budget.",236,,
1274,0.97,8246.938,8250.642,To extend the pilot program.,236,,
1275,0.97,8250.642,8259.384,Coming Online soon as a new statewide 988 system that will launch in the middle of next year.,236,,
1276,0.97,8259.384,8267.392,A new number that people can call 24 hours a day when they are considering Self-Harm or having a mental or behavioral crisis.,236,,
1277,0.97,8267.392,8271.763,None of the options allow for the dispatch of therapeutic you sources to the person calling.,236,,
1278,0.97,8271.763,8280.905,"Finally, protocols, these are the questions that lead callers, excuse me, the call taker's lead callers through when they call 91.",236,,
1279,0.97,8280.905,8288.88,The scripts and decision trees and protocols help Dispatchers send the appropriate response.,236,,
1280,0.97,8288.88,8296.021,Again right now the only responses we can send our SPD and s Fd.,236,,
1281,0.97,8296.021,8311.202,"Funding in the--to create a standardized interrogation call in the Department, which would lead to the collection of more consistent data and would also support the equitable provision of services.",236,,
1282,0.97,8311.202,8315.44,This data might be useful in the future to help guide the development of new Nonpolice dispatch protocols.,236,,
1283,0.97,8315.44,8317.509,Any questions here?,236,,
1284,0.97,8317.509,8318.743,Before I moved to the next Sli.,236,,
1285,0.97,8318.743,8323.448,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",237,,
1286,0.97,8323.448,8325.216,Not so much a question.,238,,
1287,0.97,8325.216,8338.363,Just getting back to Councilmember Lewis' earlier question about how much of these categories are directly dispatched.,238,,
1288,0.97,8338.363,8343.735,And in the fact that it is fairly limited right now.,238,,
1289,0.97,8343.735,8344.269,Right?,238,,
1290,0.97,8344.269,8352.444,And I think we have a policy interest in growing the alternatives that can be dispatched.,238,,
1291,0.97,8352.444,8373.098,"But the funding that the Council provided a couple months ago for the dispatch protocols is a necessary precondition you know, right now, the questions that dispatch asks, and has answered, when someone calls 911 are fairly simple.",238,,
1292,0.97,8373.098,8382.507,And they are simple because they only need to get you to one or two alternatives.,238,,
1293,0.97,8382.507,8390.315,"As soon as you start adding more alternatives, the questions necessary become more complex and look like a decision tree.",238,,
1294,0.97,8390.315,8403.061,"So that is what I think the Council did a good ring by not waiting until this discussion about next year's budget, in order to fund those dispatch protocols.",238,,
1295,0.97,8403.061,8411.569,It is important to get them in place before we have any additional responders who are being dispatched by 911.,238,,
1296,0.97,8414.272,8419.944,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,239,,
1297,0.97,8419.944,8422.814,"Ann if you have comments, you are welcome.",239,,
1298,0.97,8422.814,8441.433,"If I could clarify, the current investment in the cs CC, would not be sufficient to get us to a place where we were able to dispatch Non-Spd, Non- Sfd resources.",240,,
1299,0.97,8441.433,8446.07,They would have to be another investment before that came possible.,240,,
1300,0.97,8446.07,8451.81,But it is a good base set of data and the current investment would definitely support future investments.,240,,
1301,0.97,8456.781,8457.315,Wonderful.,241,,
1302,0.97,8457.315,8458.95,Thank you.,241,,
1303,0.97,8458.95,8462.787,"Councilmember Morales, please go ahead.",241,,
1304,0.97,8462.787,8466.291,Thank you.,242,,
1305,0.97,8466.291,8470.762,"Ann, I am hoping you can help me sort some things out.",242,,
1306,0.97,8470.762,8474.866,So I am looking at page 10 of the memo.,242,,
1307,0.97,8474.866,8484.175,"It talks about the report, 80% of the calls within the two year period were not criminal.",242,,
1308,0.97,8484.175,8494.619,The report recommends that alternative response options should be developed for the 70% of calls that do not require law enforcement.,242,,
1309,0.97,8494.619,8504.929,But then it says that we are really only going to be looking at 12% of calls to try to shift away.,242,,
1310,0.97,8504.929,8514.939,Is that because we just haven't Ramped up or is there some other reason why we are only looking to try to divert 12% of the calls?,242,,
1311,0.97,8514.939,8517.942,Let me follow up on that.,243,,
1312,0.97,8517.942,8531.956,"I am aware, I have seen this 30%, 12% seeming inconsistency Referenced before.",243,,
1313,0.97,8531.956,8540.832,I am not as schooled as some of my colleagues are in the report.,243,,
1314,0.97,8540.832,8542.467,But I will follow up about that.,243,,
1315,0.97,8542.467,8548.239,"I know that the 29 call types they were the low hanging fruit, if you will.",243,,
1316,0.97,8548.239,8556.281,I am not aware that anyone is thinking of the 29 call types as the end of the story.,243,,
1317,0.97,8556.281,8557.482,It is Greg.,243,,
1318,0.97,8557.482,8559.884,"Thank you, Greg.",243,,
1319,0.97,8559.884,8561.152,Thank you.,244,,
1320,0.97,8561.152,8562.387,Appreciate it.,244,,
1321,0.97,8562.387,8572.797,"Councilmember Morales, for a little background and I think you are familiar, the study divided call types into four different categories.",245,,
1322,0.97,8572.797,8586.911,"The tier that has the 29 call types we have been talking about, is the one that basically an officer is not required.",245,,
1323,0.97,8586.911,8589.581,"They are pretty much, for the most part, for the most part noncriminal.",245,,
1324,0.97,8589.581,8592.75,"They are, they are still potentially some that have risk.",245,,
1325,0.97,8592.75,8602.226,"That is why SPD risk of injury to a civilian, that is why they are doing the analysis on them.",245,,
1326,0.97,8602.226,8609.601,Spd is going to continue to do analysis on other calls that are noncriminal calls.,245,,
1327,0.97,8609.601,8626.351,Calls that might extend into the other tiers and they have a project risk to management software that would continue to do that kind of risk analysis to determine what a civilian could safely go to.,245,,
1328,0.97,8626.351,8630.254,"So that is a project that is in the pipeline, so to speak.",245,,
1329,0.97,8630.254,8632.123,It is not something totally being forgotten.,245,,
1330,0.97,8632.123,8639.464,It is just more of a next step in a project that is one I will talk about this afternoon.,245,,
1331,0.97,8639.464,8642.734,Thank you.,246,,
1332,0.97,8642.734,8643.601,Okay.,247,,
1333,0.97,8643.601,8646.17,Wonderful.,247,,
1334,0.97,8646.17,8649.974,Let's go on to 2 of 2 here.,247,,
1335,0.97,8649.974,8651.476,Thank you.,248,,
1336,0.97,8651.476,8660.485,"So if the Council did want to implement one or more of the alternatives, what might that look like?",248,,
1337,0.97,8660.485,8670.495,One option would be to locate additional functions and/or staffing that support alternatives to police response in this cs CC.,248,,
1338,0.97,8670.495,8681.005,The cs was set up to provide civilian and Community-Based services and solutions to Community-Based challenges.,248,,
1339,0.97,8681.005,8687.311,Council could determined it is the appropriate place from which to direct Nonmedical therapeutic responders.,248,,
1340,0.97,8687.311,8698.022,"One NOTE here is in the current location, the cs CC is space constraint and not able to add additional staff on-site.",248,,
1341,0.97,8698.022,8707.331,"Another additional option is alternatives to police response in Sfd, consecutive with the proposal for the new triage team.",248,,
1342,0.97,8707.331,8717.742,"The team would require Hsd and--staff, working together.",248,,
1343,0.97,8717.742,8724.348,"Another option is Partnering with Community-Based service divider on mobile integrated health solution, perhaps as a pilot program.",248,,
1344,0.97,8724.348,8736.36,"Other cities have done this, what it might look like is a contrast with a local nonprofit that has experience providing local health services.",248,,
1345,0.97,8736.36,8750.274,"The Appendix outline along those outlines, benefits and drawbacks to the models and if Council wanted to analyze any particular framework, central staff would be available to support the effort.",248,,
1346,0.97,8750.274,8750.775,Wonderful.,249,,
1347,0.97,8750.775,8757.081,Thank you . I Councilmember Lewis first and then I believe Councilmember Herbold.,249,,
1348,0.97,8757.081,8762.386,"Councilmember Lewis, do you have a question?",249,,
1349,0.97,8762.386,8765.69,I will default to Councilmember Herbold and then I would like to jump in after.,250,,
1350,0.97,8765.69,8766.491,"Great Collegiality, team.",251,,
1351,0.97,8766.491,8771.596,Please go ahead Councilmember Herbold.,251,,
1352,0.97,8771.596,8775.466,You described a potential pilot.,252,,
1353,0.97,8775.466,8781.339,But we already fund a program that would fit that definition.,252,,
1354,0.97,8781.339,8784.008,Right?,252,,
1355,0.97,8784.008,8790.381,The mobile crisis team through de SC.,252,,
1356,0.97,8790.381,8800.024,"This could be a pilot that would provide for the dispatch of mental and behavioral Healthcare resources, to the scene, where it is needed.",253,,
1357,0.97,8800.024,8807.532,So not how the service was provided but how was access.,254,,
1358,0.97,8807.532,8808.399,That is correct.,255,,
1359,0.97,8808.399,8813.037,Thank you for the opportunity to clarify.,255,,
1360,0.97,8813.037,8821.846,"It is when we talk about the potential to contract, that is not in reference to changing what is currently happening in Sfd.",255,,
1361,0.97,8821.846,8824.048,Thank you.,256,,
1362,0.97,8824.048,8826.517,Thank you.,257,,
1363,0.97,8826.517,8828.953,"Councilmember Lewis, follow up?",257,,
1364,0.97,8828.953,8830.354,Go ahead.,257,,
1365,0.97,8830.354,8834.158,To jump on the same theme.,258,,
1366,0.97,8834.158,8840.631,That team is not a first response function currently.,258,,
1367,0.97,8840.631,8843.768,It is kept by a different provider.,258,,
1368,0.97,8843.768,8863.354,"I do not necessarily think in having studied some of these Provider-Based response programs and other cities, that I am necessarily talking about getting a capability to that team.",258,,
1369,0.97,8863.354,8878.002,"I think I am talking about developing more of an intermediary the service that could be an alternative Gatekeeper that response first to the scene, then if they need the higher Acuity service, can summon the de SC team.",258,,
1370,0.97,8878.002,8888.779,I don't actually think that the majority of calls for service that there is necessarily the need for that high of Acuity level of response.,258,,
1371,0.97,8888.779,8919.21,"I think in a lot of cases you can see a low Acuity Provider- based service provided like trespass, or some of the person down calls that the triage team is envisioned to respond to, that don't necessarily require the more intense capability of the team.",258,,
1372,0.97,8919.21,8927.952,That would operate in a lower overall potential cost of what is in envisioned.,258,,
1373,0.97,8927.952,8934.258,I think it is a little bit more complicated and I think there is a little bit more overlap with the triage concept.,258,,
1374,0.97,8934.258,8943.534,"Maybe I will just Bookmark this for future comments, as we get into the different services a little bit more.",258,,
1375,0.97,8943.534,8946.704,"I do not know if this is the appropriate time to do that, Madam chair.",258,,
1376,0.97,8946.704,8950.641,Or if we want to wait for a future Sli.,258,,
1377,0.97,8950.641,8960.985,Let's take some more comments and see if that sounds okay.,259,,
1378,0.97,8960.985,8965.756,--,260,,
1379,0.97,8965.756,8967.191,I appreciate you taking metal.,261,,
1380,0.97,8967.191,8980.071,"And I think similar to the conversations we have had this month, last month, big issues we are hearing from some first responders, especially fire, they need a landing place for people they see.",261,,
1381,0.97,8980.071,8983.307,"It is less about who the first Responder is, in every case.",261,,
1382,0.97,8983.307,8985.209,And more about who they can refer out to.,261,,
1383,0.97,8985.209,8988.679,I think those are some questions I will ask as well.,261,,
1384,0.97,8988.679,8997.621,"Yes, we want the first Responder in many ways to not necessarily be the people with a gun showing A. what we need is a medical unit.",261,,
1385,0.97,8997.621,9002.326,Or people with the ability and training to treat the mind and body.,261,,
1386,0.97,9002.326,9006.197,"And then the bigger question is, where do they go?",261,,
1387,0.97,9006.197,9009.233,"So, but, we will tee up some questions for the issue I.D.",261,,
1388,0.97,9009.233,9009.633,Here to come.,261,,
1389,0.97,9009.633,9016.44,I want to see if there is anymore questions on the previous Sli that we saw before we get into issue I.D.,261,,
1390,0.97,9016.44,9017.208,Here.,261,,
1391,0.97,9017.208,9025.75,"Okay, Ann, you are really helpful, I think in explaining to folks what alternatives look like.",261,,
1392,0.97,9025.75,9027.551,Thank you for your comprehensive overview.,261,,
1393,0.97,9027.551,9037.261,"I have one question on the previous Sli before we move on but I want to double check, were you able to conclude your comments for the background?",261,,
1394,0.97,9037.261,9062.086,I just want to agree with some Council members who have Commentd that it is a complex area designing the Mih program and the program is necessarily going to be responsive to specific needs that they want to identify.,262,,
1395,0.97,9062.086,9073.164,"The table that we put together, showing how other cities have chosen to step forward, really illustrates the fact that they all look a little different.",262,,
1396,0.97,9073.164,9082.706,So it really is appropriate to craft for the need.,262,,
1397,0.97,9082.706,9091.715,Let me find the mute button.,263,,
1398,0.97,9091.715,9099.29,I want to make sure that I understand what you said on item number four.,264,,
1399,0.97,9099.29,9105.796,"When we talk about the crisis line, the individual themselves having the crisis.",264,,
1400,0.97,9105.796,9108.432,They are experiencing a mental health crisis.,264,,
1401,0.97,9108.432,9112.336,That they are having suicidal thoughts.,264,,
1402,0.97,9112.336,9124.248,"However, this is a number, it is not for if you see someone having a crisis?",264,,
1403,0.97,9124.248,9125.049,That is correct.,265,,
1404,0.97,9125.049,9132.857,"I think if you are in the same room as someone in crisis, the new 988 number might be the really good resource to have.",265,,
1405,0.97,9132.857,9141.265,"But yes, you are correct, your picture is accurate.",265,,
1406,0.97,9141.265,9147.838,"If you see somebody potentially on the street having an episode or needing assistance, that is not the right number to call.",266,,
1407,0.97,9147.838,9169.293,"And that is why we are working, I think, to ensure that you are, to make sure we have the triage model behind the scenes when 911 his call to make sure the appropriate person is then sent to the situation in the appropriate person could be someone with mental health and case management background, along with health services that you mentioned.",266,,
1408,0.97,9169.293,9169.493,Okay.,266,,
1409,0.97,9169.493,9174.765,Let's get into issue identification here.,266,,
1410,0.97,9174.765,9178.869,Issue number one.,267,,
1411,0.97,9178.869,9189.88,This concerns callers who are dealing with a mental or behavioral crisis and what Ideally like for therapeutic resources to come to the scene of the crisis.,267,,
1412,0.97,9189.88,9193.35,Currently the city is not able to dispatch such resources.,267,,
1413,0.97,9193.35,9196.62,Council members may wish to start planning for that.,267,,
1414,0.97,9196.62,9206.43,Option a would add funding for study that would recommend a plan for Non-911 crisis response line.,267,,
1415,0.97,9206.43,9209.033,And for various ways that the line could be stopped.,267,,
1416,0.97,9209.033,9211.335,"Option B, no action.",267,,
1417,0.97,9211.335,9217.041,Not going to do that.,267,,
1418,0.97,9217.041,9217.441,Okay.,268,,
1419,0.97,9217.441,9220.044,Any thoughts on the options?,268,,
1420,0.97,9220.044,9222.346,Let's do it.,269,,
1421,0.97,9222.346,9234.758,"[Laughter] you know, the one caveat, or question I would put out there, I think the goal is still trying to civilian eyes 911.",270,,
1422,0.97,9234.758,9238.696,We want people to be able to call 911 because they have been trained and conditioned to do that.,270,,
1423,0.97,9238.696,9260.985,"But behind the scenes we are hoping there is more options on the dispatch side and we can deploy the appropriate person and stay connected to the vision and setting up a clear choice for folks to know that when they call 911, there'll be a healthy and safe alternative to policing still available, is Michael.",270,,
1424,0.97,9260.985,9263.387,Councilmember Herbold.,270,,
1425,0.97,9263.387,9263.721,Thanks.,271,,
1426,0.97,9263.721,9315.139,"I want to note here I am of the understanding that the state crisis, the funding for the state, for a crisis line, a Non- first Responder crisis line, is not only for people who are in crisis, it is my understanding, we had folks come in and present in a Roundtable a couple months ago, so I have to go back and check, but it is my understanding that they are looking at setting up or supporting jurisdictions, hours would go through King County, but with state money, to set up crisis lines for us to call if we see somebody in crisis.",271,,
1427,0.97,9315.139,9318.842,And I believe it is crisis connections that will be doing that work.,271,,
1428,0.97,9318.842,9322.313,"They take those calls now, today.",271,,
1429,0.97,9322.313,9328.218,"Again, not just for somebody who is in crisis themselves, but for somebody who is looking to help somebody in crisis.",271,,
1430,0.97,9328.218,9354.645,"So, I would just ask, obviously this is something that I would want us to do but before we go down the road of funding a study, I would really want to have a super clear understanding of what is being funded with the state funding, and what the plan is for King County with crisis connections.",271,,
1431,0.97,9354.645,9357.948,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,272,,
1432,0.97,9357.948,9363.454,"I see Amy from central staff, welcome back again.",272,,
1433,0.97,9363.454,9384.675,"I want to mention, to build on what Councilmember Herbold said, I went back and I read the original legislation and I think that one of the challenges we are having here is not ambiguity, but it is kind of a gap between what the actual legislation says and what the implementation will look like.",273,,
1434,0.97,9384.675,9386.276,"And exactly what the parameters of the, look like.",273,,
1435,0.97,9386.276,9399.99,"And I believe that, I believe this is on the King County side and Stateside, and that they have some Stakeholder groups and some community groups that are working on figuring out those details.",273,,
1436,0.97,9399.99,9412.836,We will try to connect back in with them to make sure that we know exactly where they are right now as they develop these program details and Mentation before next year.,273,,
1437,0.97,9412.836,9413.103,Okay.,274,,
1438,0.97,9413.103,9413.837,That would be great.,274,,
1439,0.97,9413.837,9414.071,Sorry.,274,,
1440,0.97,9414.071,9420.344,Thank you for clarification.,274,,
1441,0.97,9420.344,9425.282,"That would be helpful to know, if it is intended for people who are concerned about health and safety of a situation as well.",274,,
1442,0.97,9425.282,9426.517,"I appreciate you Amy, and Ann.",274,,
1443,0.97,9426.517,9429.353,Your joint work on the effort.,274,,
1444,0.97,9429.353,9439.763,"And, perhaps we need to have some more conversations about this colleagues, as we figure out what the next step is here and the options that have been identified.",274,,
1445,0.97,9439.763,9448.138,"Again I think a lot of folks are trained to call 911, if they still pick up the phone and dialed 911 when they see folks in crisis.",274,,
1446,0.97,9448.138,9456.38,"I think there still wants to be that deployment of the triage system under Waybright now, so the right person shows up for the situation that is being reported.",274,,
1447,0.97,9456.38,9468.358,"And given how many people just intuitively call 911, versus having to be Retrained on a different number, perhaps there is a way to figure out the right system Behind-The-Scenes.",274,,
1448,0.97,9468.358,9485.943,"I have a number of questions about a here and at this point would love to chat more about you all about the ways in which we can get 911 system and triage that you all have been working on, and Councilmember Herbold have been leading on, to get that deployed to the right person shows up.",274,,
1449,0.97,9485.943,9496.186,"Just signaling interest in knowing more how that is coming along and how quickly that can be deployed, versus setting up completely new number.",274,,
1450,0.97,9496.186,9498.822,At the local level.,274,,
1451,0.97,9498.822,9499.022,Okay.,274,,
1452,0.97,9499.022,9500.29,Thank you.,274,,
1453,0.97,9500.29,9504.428,Let's move on.,274,,
1454,0.97,9504.428,9505.629,"Next Sli, please.",275,,
1455,0.97,9505.629,9506.496,Thank you.,275,,
1456,0.97,9506.496,9518.842,This issue concerns the proposal for the new triage one team.,275,,
1457,0.97,9518.842,9522.379,"As I noted, there is some overlap between the proposed new program, and the existing program.",275,,
1458,0.97,9522.379,9534.958,We also talked with Sfd about implementation Timeline for proposed new program and they don't believe they would be able to stand it up until quite late in 2022.,275,,
1459,0.97,9534.958,9547.571,The proposal requests 2.5 million of General fund resources but a lot of that is staff cost and would not be expanded in 2022.,275,,
1460,0.97,9547.571,9562.185,"The proposal also contemplates moving some bodies of work from SPD to Sfd but SPD has not yet reached the conclusion that this is feasible and if and when they do, it will be subject to bargaining.",275,,
1461,0.97,9562.185,9576.9,"So acknowledging some constraints, we have prepared a couple options about the new proposed mobile integrated health unit.",275,,
1462,0.97,9576.9,9580.971,The funding could be reallocated to a contracted mobile integrated health program.,275,,
1463,0.97,9580.971,9592.983,"We could establish a new mental and behavioral crisis response unit, in the CSC C, rather than Sfd.",275,,
1464,0.97,9592.983,9595.886,Because there would not be a need for medical assistance for the calls.,275,,
1465,0.97,9595.886,9608.832,We could just the parameters of the Healthone or triage programs to align with the programs and goals for 911 dispatch or take no action.,275,,
1466,0.97,9613.77,9622.846,Council member Herbold.,276,,
1467,0.97,9622.846,9630.02,The proposed unit is not different from the existing program.,277,,
1468,0.97,9630.02,9636.86,We talked earlier in this presentation about how the calls at triage one is proposing to take not calls that Healthone takes.,277,,
1469,0.97,9636.86,9638.061,There,277,,
1470,0.97,9660.117,9662.319,,278,,
1471,0.97,9686.81,9695.018,"It is my understanding again that triage one is only proposing at this stage, two call types.",279,,
1472,0.97,9695.018,9699.89,And they are not call types that Healthone takes.,279,,
1473,0.97,9699.89,9705.228,"So really, I would love to learn more.",279,,
1474,0.97,9705.228,9706.096,Thank you.,280,,
1475,0.97,9706.096,9712.002,I see Councilmember Lewis's hand.,280,,
1476,0.97,9712.002,9713.036,Go ahead.,280,,
1477,0.97,9713.036,9744.167,"I appreciate how these, I don't think that there would be anything wrong with 2022 being the year where we try multiple different ways to deploy the teams, monitored the impacts, and make decisions in 2023, on what we want to scale up or down.",280,,
1478,0.97,9744.167,9766.089,"I think that would probably be a combination of a, and B, in the sense that we may, maybe fond--fund for similar call types.",280,,
1479,0.97,9766.089,9772.062,And maybe there is a decision to divide response areas geographically.,280,,
1480,0.97,9772.062,9777.167,Or maybe Mix-And-Match with response types.,280,,
1481,0.97,9777.167,9782.272,I think we have seen from different cities there are certain inherited advantages.,280,,
1482,0.97,9782.272,9804.327,"Deploying these through a provider, having the service be infused with a lot of the criminal legal system, with community organizations, I think there is, like that is attractive.",280,,
1483,0.97,9804.327,9825.782,"I understand for a lot of reasons, the preference of the executive, to establish a new team within one of our legacy emergency response departments.",280,,
1484,0.97,9857.08,9858.582,I had not really thought about that before.,281,,
1485,0.97,9858.582,9876.6,"Maybe central staff can expand a little bit on whether giving money to Hsd, for example, to bid some kind of first response Hardwired into 911 might allow that to be stood up quicker or maybe I'm wrong about that.",281,,
1486,0.97,9876.6,9929.853,The last thing I would just say is at the end of the day what we are talking about here to make it simple is some service that is composed of an Emt and a mental health Clinician in a Van equipped to respond to low Acuity situations that currently people are not getting any kind of service response for be it a person in distress or be it a small business owner who is essentially happy to deal with that on their own in terms of trying to De-Escalate a person or meet a person's needs because the city is not sending anybody out to functionally do anything or assist with that situation.,281,,
1487,0.97,9929.853,9964.754,"And I just want to make sure whenever we are envisioning this that we are really thinking that regardless of how it's composed, it's basically going to be the same, fundamental personnel deployed through a Van as we've seen in multiple other cities and I just want to keep that grounded as we figure out how to deploy it because I worry that we inadvertently could make something complicated that could be fairly simple in terms of the team composition and just figuring out the way to get it up and get it out to meet the very real need we see right now.",281,,
1488,0.97,9964.754,9969.592,Council member Herbold.,282,,
1489,0.97,9969.592,10004.294,"As a point of urgency I think, again, some context setting . I do want to recognize that there have been, has been work for many years to have alternative response when the mental health unit was first stood up and Healthone was developed, this is work that predates the racial reckoning in the wake of George Floyd's murder.",283,,
1490,0.97,10004.294,10058.681,"But when this entire counsel began engaging even more in earnest in this issue, we were talking about Ramping up an alternative with the idea in mind that we had, at the same point that we were providing the funding and the infrastructure for planning for alternative response over the course of 2021, we had that fall approved a budget for 1343 officers . This counsel did not vote to support a hiring freeze in 2021.",283,,
1491,0.97,10058.681,10112.902,"And so we take a lot of criticism for not having this thing built yet . But we were talking about building something at that point to divert a relatively small number of calls and that we would build the system, we would reduce funding for traditional law enforcement as we were building the system and we were talking about a system that would take over a small number of calls from a fairly small number of reduced officers and I am very frustrated and I think we are all very frustrated that with so many police officers using--leaving the Department this year having nothing to do with our budget actions, people are now asking us why aren't more alternatives set up?",283,,
1492,0.97,10112.902,10132.522,And I'm very frustrated having worked on this over the course of the year with the executive that we don't have something in this budget . I'm supportive of the triage one unit but I would like to see more.,283,,
1493,0.97,10132.522,10142.465,"That triage one unit is, I believe, 4000 calls.",283,,
1494,0.97,10142.465,10144.134,And this is a safety issue.,283,,
1495,0.97,10144.134,10149.973,This is about making sure that we have the right response.,283,,
1496,0.97,10149.973,10167.056,Don't get up police response when they don't need one but it's also about making sure in those instances where the only response is a police response and that officers are able to respond to those calls.,283,,
1497,0.97,10167.056,10177.7,"And at this point, as we will talk more this afternoon about 911 response times, there are some real issues there.",283,,
1498,0.97,10177.7,10185.508,"So we really need to in this budget cycle put our heads together and figure out how to do something more quickly, bring it Online early next year.",283,,
1499,0.97,10185.508,10194.517,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,284,,
1500,0.97,10194.517,10217.64,"And I think putting into context the Statistics that you in central staff continue to raise that the Nick Jr. report and using SPD data alone shows at some point that 80% of the calls are not criminal in nature and at some point in the near future, 49% of those calls should be Transitioned to an alternate response and in this moment right now, 12% of those calls could be handled by a different entity today.",284,,
1501,0.97,10217.64,10237.56,"With those statistics, the call for urgency is Evermore important and I appreciate you expressing your frustration that this is not time to Nibble around the edges when we have an incredible need for the right person to show up at the right time.",284,,
1502,0.97,10237.56,10266.255,"We spent the last two years talking about how that's not only a good thing for the health and safety of those who are in our community that are potentially based with a mental health call and it's good for officers as well to free them up to show up to what they should be doing as police officers that are not mental health, case management or housing Connector calls and I appreciate you put that in your central staff presentation.",284,,
1503,0.97,10266.255,10266.789,Councilmember Lewis.,284,,
1504,0.97,10266.789,10267.69,You have your hand up.,284,,
1505,0.97,10267.69,10268.491,Really briefly.,285,,
1506,0.97,10268.491,10274.797,I completely agree with everything Councilmember Herbold said and share her frustration.,285,,
1507,0.97,10274.797,10276.165,I'm sure all of us do.,285,,
1508,0.97,10276.165,10293.416,I think that all the considerations Councilmember Herbold put out around urgency are good arguments for pursuing multiple response theories at the same time in the next budget and Potentilly through different departments.,285,,
1509,0.97,10293.416,10329.619,"I think that having an Hsd Provider-Based response that is pitted through Hsd and then having a triage team in the fire Department and monitoring both of them and seeing how the calls can be mixed and matched and how they cover different geographic areas is a good way to start getting some stuff out into the world so that we can start actually seeing how these things can work in practice instead of just theory and then based on those lessons, Scaling things up.",285,,
1510,0.97,10329.619,10344.033,"I do think one of the things I've been concerned about over the last year is there has been, sort of, there has been an effort to not do anything until the perfect response can be developed, to a certain extent.",285,,
1511,0.97,10344.033,10357.547,"And I think a lot of the cities that have built responses like Star or cahoots, they were built Incrementally through experimentation and through plug and play and seeing what works in the community.",285,,
1512,0.97,10357.547,10369.492,They did not just come up with the perfect program and drop it down out of the sky.,285,,
1513,0.97,10369.492,10385.108,"So, I think part of it is just getting some rubber on the road and seeing how these things can work and so if we can do that with a couple programs and a couple different departments, I think that might be a good way to do it.",285,,
1514,0.97,10385.108,10387.71,Monitor the results and then scale things up Accordingly once we have more data.,285,,
1515,0.97,10387.71,10388.478,"Thank you, colleagues.",286,,
1516,0.97,10388.478,10391.114,One more thing on the slide and then we will move on.,286,,
1517,0.97,10391.114,10427.116,I do want to make sure that they alternative responses include the alternative first responders who have been on the frontline . very much appreciate our firefighters and our case managers who are part of health 1. we've taken the program from 1 to 3 and hopefully in this quarter we will see the third fan from Healthone come Online and we have been respectful of them saying we need time to make sure they are successful in other areas and I like to see it in the five letter areas quickly brought Online when there is capacity to do that.,286,,
1518,0.97,10427.116,10445.067,"And I've heard from folks at Healthone, the firefighters, Seattle fire Department, case managers, that there is a need for us to recognize the scale at which Healthone is operating in a city as big of Seattle comparably to other cities that we look at.",286,,
1519,0.97,10445.067,10455.044,They are doing a tremendous amount of work that is on par if not even bigger than what some of the bigger case that is we reference often are doing.,286,,
1520,0.97,10455.044,10469.692,So how we could help stabilize them and make sure they have the resources they need now and expand that is something I'm interested in because they do have a tested and true model.,286,,
1521,0.97,10469.692,10473.796,"And that said, they can't be at every one of these places and they need a place to hand it off to.",286,,
1522,0.97,10473.796,10488.778,"Maybe it's that layering of where the landing place is, where that organization is that takes the hand off is equally as important as creating that initial first Responder touch point.",286,,
1523,0.97,10488.778,10489.178,Okay.,287,,
1524,0.97,10489.178,10490.446,You sparked a lot of conversation.,287,,
1525,0.97,10490.446,10493.483,"Before we move on, Lisa, is there anything you like to add on this?",287,,
1526,0.97,10493.483,10494.984,Just Teeing up for slide 10.,288,,
1527,0.97,10494.984,10495.718,Let's do it.,289,,
1528,0.97,10495.718,10503.993,"Thank you . Thank you, and that was a great introduction.",290,,
1529,0.97,10503.993,10528.284,I'm with central staff that I'm talking about the next two slides you have in front of you that will show flesh out and weed out some of the concepts you've already been discussing to show some additional policy options.,291,,
1530,0.97,10528.284,10531.254,Slide 10 shows three functions that could potentially be added to the community safety communication center.,291,,
1531,0.97,10531.254,10533.422,The first one you've been talking about and that is triage one.,291,,
1532,0.97,10533.422,10537.994,As you've heard discussions are ongoing as to whether they should be housed in the fire Department or the community safety and communication center.,291,,
1533,0.97,10537.994,10543.933,"One of the key factors in that decision is whether the firefighters would be part of the triage one response or if the unit, this unit would be fully staffed by civilians.",291,,
1534,0.97,10544.0,10555.545,Second potential function would be to move the community service officers unit out of the police Department and into the see us CC.,291,,
1535,0.97,10555.545,10560.049,"As described in the Seth memo, CSO's are currently a civilian unit within the police Department.",291,,
1536,0.97,10560.049,10568.858,That group could potentially respond to several types of calls flagged by the general report does not require a police response.,291,,
1537,0.97,10568.858,10577.099,And a third option would be to create a special unit to provide administrative response to some types of these woman calls.,291,,
1538,0.97,10577.099,10592.281,The Nick Jr. report did note that administered responders could respond to numerous calls which could include things that and mentioned about creating access to incidents without injuries are producing reports.,291,,
1539,0.97,10592.281,10601.624,"One potential step to implement this could be funding a pilot project at the Cscc using civilian, administrative responders.",291,,
1540,0.97,10601.624,10630.92,"Again, I would NOTE there is a sense of urgency to get this stood up moving these functions into the Cscc would require a fair amount of time to develop them but the administrative capacity to run these programs and potentially to update the dispatch protocols to make sure all the dispatch entities are integrated and the technology that supports dispatch is set up properly.",291,,
1541,0.97,10630.92,10644.967,"Also, some of these changes could be subject to bargaining and some I also benefited from the written agreements to put together the roles and responsibilities between the different entities.",291,,
1542,0.97,10644.967,10647.57,"Cscc, fire, please, human sources and community providers.",291,,
1543,0.97,10647.57,10657.113,With that I will pause . take no action on it adding additional functions.,291,,
1544,0.97,10657.113,10659.915,Before I go to slide 11 I want to see if there are any questions.,291,,
1545,0.97,10659.915,10661.083,Thank you.,292,,
1546,0.97,10661.083,10668.591,I want to take the hands in which they came.,292,,
1547,0.97,10668.591,10669.191,Councilmember Lewis.,292,,
1548,0.97,10669.191,10673.996,This is the first time I've been exposed to this administrative Responder concept.,293,,
1549,0.97,10673.996,10688.11,Would that basically be something where someone comes out in the community and takes a report instead of a sworn officer?,293,,
1550,0.97,10688.11,10705.194,"So if I wake up in the morning and the car, if I had a car, but if I had a car, the window to my car was broken and a call in a vehicle prowl . and instead of an officer coming, administrative Responder comes, takes the report down.",293,,
1551,0.97,10705.194,10717.44,"Takes pictures of my damaged car and if something ever comes of it in the future, another is a report and I don't have to do the report Online because there is an administrative Responder.",293,,
1552,0.97,10717.44,10722.411,Is that the concept of what that would be?,293,,
1553,0.97,10722.411,10725.247,I could not tell you the exact logistics about how that would play out.,294,,
1554,0.97,10725.247,10737.226,I know that I've Woken up and had my car missing before and sometimes you will get a police response and sometimes you would just talk to somebody on the phone.,294,,
1555,0.97,10737.226,10739.061,But somebody in the Department would fill out your report.,294,,
1556,0.97,10739.061,10740.262,It would take your information.,294,,
1557,0.97,10740.262,10740.763,File the report.,294,,
1558,0.97,10740.763,10755.377,Because when you ask for insurance coverage you have to have a police report number so that work would be done administratively and does not need to be done by a sworn officer according to the report.,294,,
1559,0.97,10755.377,10759.014,"So, it's likely this scenario you played out could be, could happen.",294,,
1560,0.97,10759.014,10764.787,I don't know how much in person conversation would be involved.,294,,
1561,0.97,10764.787,10770.793,But that's the kind of thing this job would do.,295,,
1562,0.97,10770.793,10771.494,That's what I'm asking.,295,,
1563,0.97,10771.494,10773.195,You are right about that.,296,,
1564,0.97,10773.195,10783.372,And presumably it's envisioned as an unarmed service?,296,,
1565,0.97,10783.372,10783.706,Yes.,297,,
1566,0.97,10783.706,10794.483,"For example if you had the CSO's do this, Wisher has been some conversation of doing, that group of individuals could potentially do it or some other unit, it would not be as when officers.",297,,
1567,0.97,10794.483,10813.702,One thing I would flag here that might be helpful for central staff and maybe for the executive departments is under the retail theft program loss prevention officers complete police reports which obviously are not sworn personnel and are not police.,298,,
1568,0.97,10813.702,10832.254,"So, I raise that because there's potential bargaining or labor issues that must've been envisioned but, when we did the loss prevention program because those are people doing reports that aren't police and I don't know how that was taken care of.",298,,
1569,0.97,10832.254,10838.26,This seems to touch on similar issues.,298,,
1570,0.97,10838.26,10863.219,"I would also just flag from a customer service level at the city, one thing I hear a lot of frustration about is that people that don't like going through the Byzantine, Online recording thing or don't feel like the city really cares about when they do have a package stolen or when their car is prowled because no one comes out and takes a report it.",298,,
1571,0.97,10863.219,10877.867,"So, I think from a customer service level, it is good to have some kind of service like this that could be provided and just flagging my interest in pursuing it and doing it in a way that obviously does not involve an armed sworn officer.",298,,
1572,0.97,10877.867,10881.203,If I could.,299,,
1573,0.97,10881.203,10890.779,"The theft loss prevention program, we did have a fair amount of discussion about that.",299,,
1574,0.97,10890.779,10905.327,There is a police involvement and they are on the receiving end of those reports that are filed by the prevention officers.,299,,
1575,0.97,10905.327,10907.83,"But they would be on the receiving end of these reports too, right?",300,,
1576,0.97,10907.83,10909.164,I think it's fundamentally the same exchange.,300,,
1577,0.97,10909.164,10920.609,"Again, that's why it takes a little while to stand these programs up because there are a lot of nuts and bolts to figure out about how it would actually play out.",301,,
1578,0.97,10920.609,10922.111,Councilmember Herbold.,302,,
1579,0.97,10922.111,10923.946,Thank you.,303,,
1580,0.97,10923.946,10959.782,"As it relates specifically to option B. I want to remind everybody that as part of the second quarter supplemental, or the midyear supplemental now, we parked the 2021 funding for the triage team in FAS pending a report on the program for triage team.",303,,
1581,0.97,10959.782,10979.868,I see this as potentially needing some alignment because this proposes that we tell the executive what our vision is for it and we have just recently asked them to tell us their vision and we are holding onto the money until we get that information.,303,,
1582,0.97,10979.868,11011.0,"And then in Ann's comments earlier when she was talking about the length of time it is likely to take to stand up this initial, small triage team, it sounded like she was saying pretty far into 2022 and I'm wondering, is that irrespective of whether or not it stays in fire or goes to Cscc.",303,,
1583,0.97,11011.0,11054.476,"My understanding was that it might take a while if we insisted on moving triage one into Cscc because of some of the human infrastructure that hr issues, that they are managing right now with being a new division . The Timeline for a triage one being launched out of fire would be a shorter Timeline and the idea for an Mou, I think is about, yes, the long-term vision for triage one.",303,,
1584,0.97,11054.476,11068.157,"Maybe not so much the Short- term because I think in the short term it's, like, let's make sure we are agreeing where were starting and let's get it launched and then let's have an Mou for what the long-term vision is.",303,,
1585,0.97,11068.157,11082.604,That sort of what I'm seeing but I would really like to know from Ann whether or not she is hearing that we are--that it doesn't matter where triage one is launched out of.,303,,
1586,0.97,11082.604,11088.61,You are hearing from the executive we will not see until late in 2022.,303,,
1587,0.97,11088.61,11089.011,Yes.,304,,
1588,0.97,11089.011,11103.225,"Just to confirm the Timeline that Sfd prepared for the program to launch from that Department has it fully implemented, as and they are staffed up.",304,,
1589,0.97,11103.225,11103.792,People are trained.,304,,
1590,0.97,11103.792,11106.228,They're going out onto the streets in December 2022.,304,,
1591,0.97,11106.228,11116.138,"We have heard from them that if the program were launched out of the Cscc, it would take longer than that.",304,,
1592,0.97,11116.138,11126.114,But I have not followed up on specifically how much longer would be happy to do that if it's of interest.,304,,
1593,0.97,11126.114,11134.156,Begs the question why there was such an urgent press release and press conference held on it in Mid-2021 if 2022 end of the year is the actual launch point.,305,,
1594,0.97,11134.156,11147.669,"I think that we very much would like to see how fast we can move some of those conversations along and I'm surprised by that Timeline and Councilmember Herbold, you and I are anticipating something much quicker than that.",305,,
1595,0.97,11147.669,11149.271,I see you on the line.,305,,
1596,0.97,11149.271,11152.541,Welcome . do you have anything else to add?,305,,
1597,0.97,11152.541,11153.275,Please feel free to.,305,,
1598,0.97,11153.275,11154.776,Thank you.,306,,
1599,0.97,11154.776,11159.481,I wanted to weigh in or add in if necessary.,306,,
1600,0.97,11159.481,11182.504,"You already said it but since Ann wasn't here at the time, I think the story is unfolding and I wanted to affirm what Councilmember Herbold was communicating is what we understood in July and August when the Council was considering the supplemental budget ask . story has evolved a bit in times of the timing.",306,,
1601,0.97,11182.504,11183.138,That's interesting.,307,,
1602,0.97,11183.138,11201.623,"We will follow up with you and to the conversations that we have had with first responders from fire, as well, another was a lot of concern about that program being stood up without conversations from frontline members from Aaf 27.",307,,
1603,0.97,11201.623,11204.927,This gives us an opportunity to talk to firefighters themselves to see how those conversations are progressing.,307,,
1604,0.97,11204.927,11210.299,Appreciate the sense of urgency that we all have.,307,,
1605,0.97,11210.299,11217.806,Trying to get something set up but it doesn't actually help to have a press release in July that then is not for a program that's potentially going to launch until December 2022.,307,,
1606,0.97,11217.806,11233.555,"To the point of our colleagues earlier, I think there is a lot to be potentially done in this budget to try to provide Swifter action and true alternatives.",307,,
1607,0.97,11233.555,11234.723,Let's continue to go through this.,307,,
1608,0.97,11234.723,11237.459,I will try to see how far we can get in the next 20 minutes.,307,,
1609,0.97,11237.459,11242.731,We do have two more items on this section and then three more issue identification pieces.,307,,
1610,0.97,11242.731,11251.006,"If we don't get through them all, I do need to have a hard stop at 1:00 so we can give folks a full hour for a meal break and then we will resume at 2:00 with anything we haven't covered.",307,,
1611,0.97,11251.006,11253.408,Let's see how much we can get done in the next 20 minutes.,307,,
1612,0.97,11253.408,11257.346,Thank you.,308,,
1613,0.97,11257.346,11260.882,I will quickly go over slide 11 and then we will move into the next half of the paper.,308,,
1614,0.97,11260.882,11269.157,Issue number 4 is a response to low-level criminal 911 calls.,308,,
1615,0.97,11269.157,11278.7,"So as Greg mentioned and Ann mention, the police Department is using a Risk-Based analysis of the services.",308,,
1616,0.97,11278.7,11296.718,"They can be handled by severely--with minimal risk as a follow-up and you can see in the staff report in the Appendix X on page 26, you will see a list of the call types included in the SPD analysis.",308,,
1617,0.97,11296.718,11299.921,Councilmember Herbold added the Poice reports anticipated to be completed by the end of Q1 2022.,308,,
1618,0.97,11299.921,11320.742,So that information came out after these options were produced but option one then would be to create a similar legislative intent asking for a report on that risk analysis by a specific date and now we note that date is and of Q1.,308,,
1619,0.97,11320.742,11322.611,We could ask for that report by that date.,308,,
1620,0.97,11322.611,11334.756,Option two would instead add Ftd and funding to establish a unit in the Cscc to provide civilian response to 911 calls.,308,,
1621,0.97,11334.756,11341.363,And that overlaps with some of the other discussion you previously had.,308,,
1622,0.97,11341.363,11342.23,Okay.,309,,
1623,0.97,11342.23,11344.166,Wonderful.,309,,
1624,0.97,11344.166,11351.473,"Colleagues, any comments or questions, thoughts responses to this one?",309,,
1625,0.97,11351.473,11353.542,Not seeing anyone.,309,,
1626,0.97,11353.542,11375.664,I'd be interested in learning more about option a with members of the public safety committee and look forward to coordinating with the chair and other Councilmembers to see what your responses would be.,309,,
1627,0.97,11375.664,11379.601,I think it's clear that we are interested in swift action on the items that could be moved over quickly.,310,,
1628,0.97,11379.601,11389.177,"I would then turn it back to introduce the section of the paper addressing the alternatives to prosecution and jail if that meets your needs, council chair?",311,,
1629,0.97,11389.177,11394.216,Thank you.,312,,
1630,0.97,11394.216,11404.226,As you mentioned I will be talking about alternatives to prosecution jail in the context of the 2022 proposed budget we are looking specifically at two things.,312,,
1631,0.97,11404.226,11409.03,Prefiling diversion and at subsidies for electronic home monitoring.,312,,
1632,0.97,11409.03,11411.433,I will start talking about Prefiling diversion and then move into Bhm.,312,,
1633,0.97,11411.433,11421.409,Currently the city attorney's office does what a Prefiling diversion program that weaves together three different elements.,312,,
1634,0.97,11421.409,11431.353,Looking at individuals accused of committing low-level Misdemeanors and an expanding out to Relicensing for individuals accused of driving while the license is suspended in the 3RD degree.,312,,
1635,0.97,11431.353,11446.735,And then expand it into diversion for individuals accused of not intimate partner or family domestic violence.,312,,
1636,0.97,11446.735,11459.281,In the Seattle Reentry group report which was issued in 2018 that was a recommendation to expand this current Prefiling diversion program for individuals that were 25 and over and to a broader set of potential Misdemeanors that were eligible for diversion.,312,,
1637,0.97,11459.281,11471.393,"The counsel asked for a statement of legislative intent from the city attorney's office to request that law evaluate looking at the staffing and resources it would take to expand the program, as well as providing funding for Prefiling diversion, racial equity Toolkit.",312,,
1638,0.97,11471.393,11473.361,Assessing that concept.,312,,
1639,0.97,11473.361,11488.176,And so both a current Prefiling diversion program and the expanded concept are issues that I won't raise in a moment.,312,,
1640,0.97,11488.176,11497.185,I wanted to provide some additional context as to specific recommendations that came from the community task force on Criminal/Legal system alignment and the Ret.,312,,
1641,0.97,11497.185,11514.603,Those considerations are in Appendix W that are in the paper but contain similar themes around principles that Prefiling diversion should align with to be most affected to community members.,312,,
1642,0.97,11514.603,11524.913,"You will see those elements, as I said, in Appendix W but I will mention just a couple of them here.",312,,
1643,0.97,11524.913,11531.119,Some of them are to focus on declining charges or Decriminalization rather than focusing solely on diversion.,312,,
1644,0.97,11531.119,11543.265,"Making sure that we are looking at root causes . Why people commit Misdemeanors, especially when they are in constant poverty asking that diversion be voluntary rather than compliance based.",312,,
1645,0.97,11543.265,11550.238,Finding it can be problematic when we are relying solely on the discretion of law enforcement officials.,312,,
1646,0.97,11550.238,11557.178,And eliminating barriers to Accessing diversion.,312,,
1647,0.97,11557.178,11579.301,One of the specific concepts that is related because we are in budget season is that the text of the criminal system should not be expanded but rather that funding programs like this and tended to decrease further involvement with the system should be funded with existing funds into the system.,312,,
1648,0.97,11579.301,11590.312,If we could move to the next slide you will see I flagged--in terms of fully stopping the existing diversion program.,312,,
1649,0.97,11590.312,11603.291,"As it stands in the 2022 budget, there is a proposal to add funds to make sure this program is fully staffed.",312,,
1650,0.97,11603.291,11605.927,Right now is staffed by a Part- time Paralegal and two assistant prosecutors.,312,,
1651,0.97,11605.927,11618.306,"The proposed budget would add in an additional almost $248,000 and a strategic adviser, as well as making the Paralegal a full-time position rather than a half-time position.",312,,
1652,0.97,11618.306,11633.121,In terms of issues laid out Aligning with principals there are a couple options for the counsel.,312,,
1653,0.97,11633.121,11654.509,You could fund this proposed program in the budget and then adopt a statement of legislative intent asking that law submit a program to the counsel talk about how the existing program Aligns with the principles both in the Ret and in the task force report and recommend any changes that would allow the program where it doesn't align to align better with full recommendations.,312,,
1654,0.97,11654.509,11666.287,The second piece is to potentially--the proposed fun and prohibit expenditure until law provides that kind of reporting.,312,,
1655,0.97,11666.287,11674.162,Or provides the proposed funds to mandate that the funds could only be used to support Prefiling diversion program that does align with the principles laid out.,312,,
1656,0.97,11674.162,11678.299,Or the counsel to take no action and just allow the funding to move forward.,312,,
1657,0.97,11678.299,11686.708,Regarding the funding source there are a couple options laid out here.,312,,
1658,0.97,11686.708,11701.322,And for this first option a you can cut the funds from the budget and not add staff at all if you wanted to use those funds for other counsel priorities.,312,,
1659,0.97,11701.322,11716.337,"Option B is to cut the general fund allocation and replace it with existing funds and staff from the police Department, other places and L.A.W .'s criminal division or the Seattle municipal court and I wanted to provide more context about this particular option.",312,,
1660,0.97,11716.337,11723.411,I'm currently working with the city attorney's office to figure out if there are existing ways to Reallocate funds that are currently within the criminal division into Prefiling diversion.,312,,
1661,0.97,11723.411,11749.537,"There are a couple considerations that relate to how staffing works . The first is something that's within the counsel's Purview to some extent but the number of cases and charges that come into the system are predicated on the things, behaviors that are Criminalized as Misdemeanors within the Seattle municipal code.",312,,
1662,0.97,11749.537,11758.546,"To the extent that counsel has the jurisdiction to Decriminalize some of these things, that could potentially cut down on the number of reports and arrests that are coming into the system.",312,,
1663,0.97,11758.546,11777.565,I will note that there are limitations in terms of what counsel can do in this regard because so many of the crimes that are listed as Misdemeanors are state-level crimes and so the the trend--Council doesn't necessarily have the jurisdiction to change at the state level what is at the city council.,312,,
1664,0.97,11777.565,11786.808,The recent example is the ways in which they Council Decriminalized drug and prostitution Loitering.,312,,
1665,0.97,11786.808,11795.817,"So if there are additional crimes that could be moved out of the code, that could potentially decrease the number of cases coming in.",312,,
1666,0.97,11795.817,11808.029,The other issue that relates to freeing up capacity in the city attorney's office would be around how a city attorney chooses to handle reports that are coming into the office.,312,,
1667,0.97,11808.029,11823.945,"On the one hand if a city attorney were to decline to charge any of those cases, there would not even be an option of moving that case forward or in choosing to prosecute arts to divert.",312,,
1668,0.97,11823.945,11839.16,"They would just be declining charges altogether and that would decrease the ability, excuse me, decrease the number of cases that a potential Prosecutor would move forward with for charging, Disgracing any potential for prosecutors across the system.",312,,
1669,0.97,11839.16,11848.169,The other item of NOTE would be if a future city attorney decided to divert a higher number of cases.,312,,
1670,0.97,11848.169,11870.959,Outstanding eligibility or increasing overall the cases that moved into a diversion program that could also potentially free up a Prosecutor that would otherwise be pursuing those charges in court and provide for that Prosecutor moving into Prefiling diversion.,312,,
1671,0.97,11870.959,11881.369,All that to say I am still working with the city attorney's office to figure out what that kind of staffing looks like and would hopefully have more information about that as the analysis continues.,312,,
1672,0.97,11881.369,11886.608,Those are the pieces related to how to fund the existing program.,312,,
1673,0.97,11886.608,11892.213,I will stop right there for any questions before moving into the next issue which is also related to Prefiling diversion but on the expansion piece.,312,,
1674,0.97,11892.213,11894.816,Thank you.,313,,
1675,0.97,11894.816,11899.387,Councilmember Herbold and then Councilmember Lewis.,313,,
1676,0.97,11899.387,11899.921,Thank you.,314,,
1677,0.97,11899.921,11910.431,"Just for everybody's Situational awareness, as a said sometimes, and because our Timelines are short.",314,,
1678,0.97,11910.431,11926.347,I just want to say that of the Prefiling diversion actions that Councilmember Gonzalez is covering here.,314,,
1679,0.97,11926.347,11938.559,There's more but between this one and the next when I do not have a city council budget action related to fully staffing the existing Prefiling diversion program.,314,,
1680,0.97,11938.559,11952.04,"So if someone is interested in taking that on, I just want to let folks know that that is not something, not because I'm not interested in, I absolutely am.",314,,
1681,0.97,11952.04,11978.099,"But because for the expansion of the Prefiling diversion program to people over 25, that's work I've been engaged in because of efforts from Council President Gonzales a couple years ago and a report coming to my Committee on the racial equity Toolkit that we asked them to do.",314,,
1682,0.97,11978.099,11999.62,I just been a little bit more engaged and have actually requested that the law Department make a proposal for the Prefiling diversion program to be expanded to over 25-Year- olds.,314,,
1683,0.97,11999.62,12001.723,I do have a proposal around that but not about this one.,314,,
1684,0.97,12001.723,12006.594,I want folks to know in case you are interested in the option that Asha is proposing.,314,,
1685,0.97,12006.594,12012.6,"Thank you for that preview, Councilmember Herbold.",315,,
1686,0.97,12012.6,12013.201,Councilmember Lewis.,315,,
1687,0.97,12013.201,12014.302,Please go ahead.,315,,
1688,0.97,12014.302,12028.249,And similar to Councilmember Herbold's comments I don't really at this point have anything to weigh in on the options that have been put up here.,316,,
1689,0.97,12028.249,12040.228,I just want to comment on a more fundamental level that there is going to be a change in leadership in the city attorney's office after this next election and I do think a lot of these questions.,316,,
1690,0.97,12040.228,12086.107,"Asha, I don't know what you're conversations I've been like with the current city attorney's office in terms of how to protect at some of the information you are requesting because a lot of it will be contingent on what direction the new city attorney wants to take to a certain extent . This just want to flag your interest that I have been using our powers under the charter to create legislation creating a duty for the city attorney to maintain a diversion program as a fundamental part, item of business that we do and at this point it shouldn't be, frankly, discretionary for diversion to be part of that work.",316,,
1691,0.97,12086.107,12124.445,"We've seen over the last couple of years, and therefore directly with the diversion program, the incredible results of that program as demonstrated in a very low Recidivism rate for people that participate in that program as demonstrated by the very strong community partnerships between choose 180 and the city government and really fundamentally changing at the core of our legal system to being more restorative rather than being more punitive.",316,,
1692,0.97,12124.445,12139.56,"And I think it's too important to be in a position where a city attorney could just, by their discretion, get out of that line of business and to stop doing Prefiled diversion as part of the practice.",316,,
1693,0.97,12139.56,12147.568,"So, I do think, we have the power under the charter to create affirmative duties for the city attorney.",316,,
1694,0.97,12147.568,12159.881,"I think that we should exercise that power given that we are going to be, for the first time in 12 years, Transitioning.",316,,
1695,0.97,12159.881,12187.575,"And for the first time with the Pre-Diversion a concept, Transitioning leadership in the Department picked to make it clear, this is something that the city will continue to do and give some peace of mind to community Stakeholders that that program is not just going to be arbitrarily washed away in the event there is a city attorney that doesn't believe in Prefiled diversion or doesn't think it should be part of their business.",316,,
1696,0.97,12187.575,12201.789,"So, I just wanted to flag that as something I'm interested in and flag it to give Maybe some relief to our committee partners who are potentially concerned that this could all just go away based on that change in leadership.",316,,
1697,0.97,12201.789,12205.126,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Lewis.",317,,
1698,0.97,12205.126,12211.199,Appreciate that concept.,317,,
1699,0.97,12211.199,12219.64,"And, Asha do you have anything else you would like to go through on the slide?",317,,
1700,0.97,12219.64,12222.243,Not on the slide.,318,,
1701,0.97,12222.243,12229.55,Many of the considerations and much of what we have discussed will apply to the next slide which is about expanding Prefiled diversion.,318,,
1702,0.97,12229.55,12231.218,Let's go ahead and go to that one.,319,,
1703,0.97,12231.218,12235.189,"We have about five more minutes and if we can't get through it, then we will do a pause at 1:00.",319,,
1704,0.97,12235.189,12241.562,Thank you.,320,,
1705,0.97,12241.562,12245.366,So as it currently stands the 2022 proposed budget does not include any funds for expanding the Prefiling diversion program.,320,,
1706,0.97,12245.366,12267.121,"But in the consideration of expansion as Councilmember Herbold Mentione, there is a response as well as an Ret that happened.",320,,
1707,0.97,12267.121,12269.857,They were able to estimate the cost of such a program would be $1.4 million.,320,,
1708,0.97,12269.857,12273.794,"$750,000 or go directly to Supportng the community partner and $680,000 or go toward supporting staffing and the city attorney's office.",320,,
1709,0.97,12273.794,12294.982,"And so, as I mentioned, there are options around potentially figuring out how these align with the recommendations that came out of the task force report and the Ret option a is to do adopt a Sli with that would require Trentor to submit a report about the alignment of principles and how they would align the program.",320,,
1710,0.97,12294.982,12324.779,"Option B would be to add funds to expand Prefiling diversion and to either do it without a proviso, with the proviso that requires the funds be spent on a program that Aligns with the principles in the task force report and the Ret, or with the proviso to prohibit expenditure until a report came in that describes alignment, or C, the Council to take no action.",320,,
1711,0.97,12325.613,12333.32,"And similar to the considerations I mentioned above about the existing Prefiling diversion program when it comes to funding source, you can either add option a to add general funds to provide the staffing and support needed to expand the program.",320,,
1712,0.97,12333.32,12351.038,"Option B would be to Reallocate funds already within the system so either from the police Department, other places in the Attorney offices criminal division are the Seattle municipal port to fund the program or you could take no action which would mean not expanding, not providing funds for staffing to expand the Prefiling diversion program.",320,,
1713,0.97,12351.038,12351.572,Thank you.,321,,
1714,0.97,12351.572,12363.584,Any initial comments or questions on item 1b?,321,,
1715,0.97,12363.584,12369.79,Okay.,321,,
1716,0.97,12369.79,12381.402,"Asha, tell me more about--this may not be a simple answer but, what would like to make some of the policy changes outlined in the central staff memo instead of expanding the city attorney budget?",321,,
1717,0.97,12381.402,12385.506,Have we done that sort of analysis?,321,,
1718,0.97,12385.506,12458.479,"So, I think the challenge is that by expanding the policy pieces and eligibility of the program, it will mean more cases coming in so that sort of automatically UPS the amount of the body of work that the city attorney's office would need to do . and given the existing program isn't fully staffed in a way to do both the work of diversion generally, as well as some of the reform work that they currently Prosecutor has been doing in terms of participating in work around jail use and work around the criminal legal system efforts, otherwise it may be difficult for the city attorney's office to handle the influx in case volume that comes without additional staffing . The funding that would go to a community program to be able to do this work in the same way, I don't know that they would have the capacity to take on the additional volume of cases that would come with expansion so even if we were to make the policy changes in the city's attorney's office were to expand diversion, I think it would be difficult for them to actually handle the Practicalities of that level of case volume.",322,,
1719,0.97,12458.479,12459.246,Councilmember Herbold.,323,,
1720,0.97,12459.246,12461.482,I want to clarify.,324,,
1721,0.97,12461.482,12474.094,"What I think I heard you say, Asha, is more cases will be coming in but not that more cases will be coming into the L.A.W.",324,,
1722,0.97,12474.094,12476.497,"Department for prosecution, but there will be more cases eligible for diversion.",324,,
1723,0.97,12476.497,12520.941,"Those diversion cases staffed in the city attorney's office manage those cases through the diversion program and so I think that's why when we are referring to these principles from the criminal legal system task force there are a number of principles . preference is not to expand the funding Footprint for components of the Cls, the city attorney being one of them, but in those cases when you might be doing so, the preference is that you take money from other places in the Cls.",324,,
1724,0.97,12520.941,12537.625,"So that's why under option B it's a recognition that you may need to add funding to the CIO but you should take it from somewhere else within the Cls, the criminal legal system.",324,,
1725,0.97,12537.625,12557.478,"And then there is a community component, community Stakeholder funding component also for some of the programmatic's that doesn't not need to be held in the 30--city attorney's office.",324,,
1726,0.97,12557.478,12558.879,Thank you to the clear vacation.,325,,
1727,0.97,12558.879,12562.383,And with that I would be leaning towards option 2.,325,,
1728,0.97,12562.383,12573.627,Option B 2 to make sure there is alignment with its recommendations.,325,,
1729,0.97,12573.627,12576.597,Councilmember Lewis to close us out on this item and less Councilmember Herbold at something else.,325,,
1730,0.97,12576.597,12577.898,I see her hand go down.,325,,
1731,0.97,12577.898,12578.465,Councilmember Lewis.,325,,
1732,0.97,12578.465,12580.501,Let's close us out on the slide if you don't wind.,325,,
1733,0.97,12580.501,12592.513,"I similarly concur with Councilmember Herbold and, Madam chair, your preferences in regard on how to proceed with this.",326,,
1734,0.97,12592.513,12636.423,"I guess one thing that I would flag based on my personal experience is I do firmly believe that over the course of a couple of budget cycles if there is a Prefiled diversion expansion, there will be and efficiency realized in the criminal division city attorney's office and in terms of freeing up additional time by reducing the amount of employee hours required to process a similar number of cases . diversion work is considerably less time-consuming than adversarial criminal litigation.",326,,
1735,0.97,12636.423,12640.828,"And as that is expanded, I think there will be some corresponding savings that could be captured and reinvested in other city priorities.",326,,
1736,0.97,12640.828,12661.882,I guess what I would like to do is figure out a way that we can structure a way to monitor the increased efficiencies and the reduced demand and then have that be part of what we do over a series of budget cycles.,326,,
1737,0.97,12661.882,12681.201,"Similar to how we are interacting with the police Department as Councilmember Herbold indicated earlier, you don't want to be in a position, which has been the Council's position, of cutting before those capacity efficiencies are realized, which, of course, this Council hasn't actually done despite misconceptions in the community.",326,,
1738,0.97,12681.201,12709.329,But to reduce some of the functions in the city attorney's office before those efficiencies are realized could be problematic but I think that by monitoring and having a stated budgetary goal over time expanding diversion and then reducing the overall Footprint of the criminal division is something that can be and will be realized by increasing and expanding diversion.,326,,
1739,0.97,12709.329,12714.601,So just some way to structure and trap that so in future budgets we can continue that work.,326,,
1740,0.97,12714.601,12714.935,Okay.,327,,
1741,0.97,12714.935,12729.249,"Thank you very much for that comment and appreciate and agree with that sentiment that we need to appropriately scale and thank you for the clarification, colleagues, on this piece.",327,,
1742,0.97,12729.249,12731.118,I will suggest we take a pause.,327,,
1743,0.97,12731.118,12738.425,"Come back . We do have a few more slides to go, about five more slides.",327,,
1744,0.97,12738.425,12745.399,We will come back and start again on slide 15 unless there's any additional questions or comments on this one?,327,,
1745,0.97,12745.399,12764.651,"Madam clerk, I would like to give folks a full hour so if there is no objection, if there is no objection I would like to amend the agenda to have our recess and add 2:05 P.M.",327,,
1746,0.97,12764.651,12766.687,Is there any objection to amending the agenda?,327,,
1747,0.97,12766.687,12771.792,To have a full hour recess and return at 2:05 P.M.,327,,
1748,0.97,12771.792,12777.03,Hearing no objection the agenda is amended.,327,,
1749,0.97,12777.03,12778.165,We will have a full hour.,327,,
1750,0.97,12778.165,12788.308,"Thank you, all, for joining us again to continue the alternative responses and then leading into SPD.",327,,
1751,0.97,12788.308,12790.177,We will get you out of here before 5:00 P.M.,327,,
1752,0.97,12790.177,12790.511,Tonight.,327,,
1753,0.97,12790.511,12791.979,Thank you for all your time and questions.,327,,
1754,0.97,12791.979,12792.78,The meeting is in recess.,327,,
