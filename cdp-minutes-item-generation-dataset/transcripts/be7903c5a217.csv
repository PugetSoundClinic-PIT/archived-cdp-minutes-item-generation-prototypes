209,0.97,1362.828,1366.732,Thank you so much.,31,,
210,0.97,1366.732,1381.012,I want to start today by thanking all the working people and community members who have organized with the annual people's budget campaign for 7 consecutive years and are now doing it for the eighth year running.,31,,
211,0.97,1381.012,1391.857,Also to those who are speaking up in support of the solidarity budget . I also want to thank all the Council members who have already agreed to cosponsor several of the amendments from my office.,31,,
212,0.97,1391.857,1412.911,I'm happy to do likewise . I know my staff are having those conversations with your offices and I really appreciate that.,31,,
213,0.97,1412.911,1415.313,"As I mentioned last week, my office has signed a number of post budget amendments to all Council members.",31,,
214,0.97,1415.313,1417.415,These limits from the office include the people's budget demand and the most permanent ones.,31,,
215,0.97,1417.415,1422.888,"The solidarity budget especially those that are relevant to increasing the funds in a significant way, increasing significant funds for our affordable social housing and [Indiscernible] programs.",31,,
216,0.97,1422.888,1428.293,We don't yet have cosponsors for those amendments.,31,,
217,0.97,1428.293,1429.361,I really urge Council members to support those.,31,,
218,0.97,1429.361,1432.664,Those are the paramount ones that we have to do as a city council for addressing the needs of our city.,31,,
219,0.97,1432.664,1445.577,The 2018 Seattle report from the office of Sustainability and environment show that greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced to 50% by 2030 and reach Carbonate child by 2050.,31,,
220,0.97,1445.577,1452.384,This requires a reduction rate 17 times larger than our current rate.,31,,
221,0.97,1452.384,1454.085,"That is a serious, serious problem we have.",31,,
222,0.97,1454.085,1471.603,"In fact, as some of you may have heard me mention in one of this years meetings of the Sustainability and Renters right committee that my office shares, presented the 2018 community greenhouse gas emissions inventory.",31,,
223,0.97,1471.603,1483.248,"In the study, since the last report in 2018 Seattle's overall greenhouse gas emissions have increased 1.1%.",31,,
224,0.97,1483.248,1513.578,"It's an increase of 1.1% . While overall emissions since 2008 have gone down by 4.1% right now the reduction is grossly inadequate and the emotions from the building sector have increased by 8.3% since the 2015 report, largely as a result of fossil fuel gas use for cooking, space, and water heating, and building.",31,,
225,0.97,1513.578,1520.051,We have a serious task if we are to bring Seattle to that kind of goal that we have 40 emissions.,31,,
226,0.97,1520.051,1521.086,We are still not on track.,31,,
227,0.97,1521.086,1527.592,I really urge budget puzzles as a serious challenge to us.,31,,
228,0.97,1527.592,1531.596,I hope Council members will support these amendments.,31,,
229,0.97,1531.596,1532.097,They are urgent.,31,,
230,0.97,1532.097,1538.403,Funding the mandate of these limits requires increasing the big business tax rates this year.,31,,
231,0.97,1538.403,1544.276,I urge Council members to also support that.,31,,
232,0.97,1544.276,1549.014,On today's city council agenda of the proclamations of 3- Pointers to the Seattle Renters' Commission.,31,,
233,0.97,1549.014,1553.018,"Typically, those apartments would first be considered by the Sustainability and Renters right committee.",31,,
234,0.97,1553.018,1560.058,Because there on hold during budget deliberations we are referring is directed to the city council.,31,,
235,0.97,1560.058,1566.932,The new members for the Renters Commission can be in place in time to attend the November 1ST meeting of the Seattle Renters Commission.,31,,
236,0.97,1566.932,1579.644,"My office has chaired the committee . also the [Indiscernible] office were contacted by the Renters Commission, because have a Chelated several vacancies.",31,,
237,0.97,1579.644,1580.845,Many of the members of the Commission really work hard.,31,,
238,0.97,1580.845,1591.623,They are one of the commissions that are setting the standard for what the commissions should be doing for the people in Seattle.,31,,
239,0.97,1591.623,1592.49,Working for the people in Seattle.,31,,
240,0.97,1592.49,1600.465,Because of not having the authority try to reach a Quorum.,31,,
241,0.97,1600.465,1601.967,All the Council appointed commissions were killed over the summer.,31,,
242,0.97,1601.967,1609.975,There have been five positions that the Mayor is responsible for pointing that has been vacant for an unusually long time.,31,,
243,0.97,1609.975,1616.481,In addition there's a Council appointed Commission that was newly vacated over the summer in addition to 2 recently vacated Commission appointed positions.,31,,
244,0.97,1616.481,1624.99,The Renters Commission has taken Proactive steps to help the vacant positions.,31,,
245,0.97,1624.99,1625.624,They advertised the openings.,31,,
246,0.97,1625.624,1633.999,We received many applications and conducted interviews and made recommendations for filling all eight vacant positions.,31,,
247,0.97,1633.999,1645.81,"As chair of the Sustainability and Renters right committee I move the appointment of Haley Freedlund, the commissions recommendation and the appointments of Mariana LORI on an Rachel Sanchez . The two Commission appointed positions.",31,,
248,0.97,1645.81,1665.497,"Those are the three that on today's city council agenda for a vote . unfortunate, even the Commission also recommended candidates for the Mayor appointed positions . We continue to wait for the Mayor to make those appointments, which honestly literally just means signing her name to the appointment packets that the Perp Commission has prepared for her.",31,,
249,0.97,1665.497,1666.331,And hope that she does that.,31,,
250,0.97,1666.331,1680.011,As I mentioned during the last week I urge the Mayor to do that.,31,,
251,0.97,1680.011,1692.791,"The Renters Commission has played a tremendous role in fighting for Renters rights in the last several years, most recently the bill the city council passed increasing the notice the landlord must give Renters for rent increases to 6 months came at the recognition of the Commission.",31,,
252,0.97,1692.791,1696.761,They have done exactly work on many other bills in the past this year.,31,,
253,0.97,1696.761,1709.24,The bills coming from my office . They wouldn't have had the momentum had the Renters Commission and other Renters rights advocates like the tenant unit and other organizations including labor unions not advocated for it.,31,,
254,0.97,1709.24,1715.046,With the five vacancies it leaves very small margins for Korma.,31,,
255,0.97,1715.046,1718.083,On a 15 person Commission is a volunteer board.,31,,
256,0.97,1718.083,1724.656,If only three people are not in a meeting suddenly they don't have a Quorum.,31,,
257,0.97,1724.656,1726.991,I hope the Mayor makes that Commission the next two weeks.,31,,
258,0.97,1726.991,1734.833,"I will do what I can to support those commissions, so that the Commission can be fully staffed again for their November meeting.",31,,
259,0.97,1734.833,1748.48,Also at today's city council meeting I intend to make a motion to amend the introduction of referral calendar to introduce the legislation requiring contractors to pay the parking expenses of the construction workers working on their projects in Seattle.,31,,
260,0.97,1748.48,1755.62,My office is in the copy of this legislation to all their offices and shared with the public last week.,31,,
261,0.97,1755.62,1762.594,I would like Council members to know it is being drafted by central staff in my counsel briefing remarks for the past several weeks.,31,,
262,0.97,1762.594,1771.87,At least 315 working people have Emailed our Council members in the last few days urging they support this paid parking legislation.,31,,
263,0.97,1771.87,1784.516,"As I mentioned before, we also circulated a community petition which has Garnered 1147 signatures . 366 of whom are from construction workers.",31,,
264,0.97,1784.516,1795.86,"Instruction workers are often required to drive to work, because they are transporting heavy tools . They commute long distances and start work extremely early in the morning.",31,,
265,0.97,1795.86,1798.263,Often before many transit lines have begun operating.,31,,
266,0.97,1798.263,1806.371,"This is not a question of whether construction workers drive to work, it's a question of who will pay for it when the job requires them to drive to work.",31,,
267,0.97,1806.371,1819.884,My office heard from many carpenters and union leaders on the picket lines on the recent carpenters strike . It's a major issue for construction workers.,31,,
268,0.97,1819.884,1826.224,"It's an issue faced by carpenters, but also by construction workers and other building trades.",31,,
269,0.97,1826.224,1831.296,"The legislation from my office protects all construction workers, even those who are not yet protected by a Union.",31,,
270,0.97,1831.296,1834.666,Similar to the approach taken by prevailing wage legislation.,31,,
271,0.97,1834.666,1840.972,"My intention is to move to introduce the legislation today and refer directly to the city council for a vote on November 1ST, in two weeks.",31,,
272,0.97,1840.972,1848.179,During budget committee meetings that are on hold.,31,,
273,0.97,1848.179,1853.184,There's nothing that stops Council members from supporting workers rights by putting that legislation directly to the full city council meeting during the budget.,31,,
274,0.97,1853.184,1867.398,I am happy to address any questions or concerns Council members might have.,31,,
275,0.97,1867.398,1868.433,Please feel free to reach out to my staff.,31,,
276,0.97,1868.433,1869.968,We are happy to sit down and discuss the legislation.,31,,
277,0.97,1869.968,1872.27,"Is nothing like obligated about the legislation, but we are here to answer any questions or concerns.",31,,
278,0.97,1872.27,1882.68,"In fact, it's precisely what we are doing about the Renters commissions appointments, taking them greatly to the city council well ordinarily we would not do that.",31,,
279,0.97,1882.68,1894.359,"While this legislation is important and it will have a big impact on the lives of thousands of workers in Seattle, as I mentioned just now, it is actually very straightforward as the legislation language itself goes.",31,,
280,0.97,1894.359,1897.962,There are no complicated technical questions that would require an extensive committee discussion and amendment process.,31,,
281,0.97,1897.962,1912.877,Either Council members think the construction bosses should pay parking costs incurred by workers each day and support this legislation or they think workers to continue to pay thousands of dollars a year apiece and support the status quo.,31,,
282,0.97,1912.877,1917.548,It's really as simple as that.,31,,
283,0.97,1917.548,1929.694,"This legislation in my view should be passed as soon as possible, because counsel should not have a lackadaisical attitude toward protecting workers rights, parking costs have been a big issue in every single construction worker's contract in recent years.",31,,
284,0.97,1929.694,1935.967,From electricians to operating engineers to most recently the carpenters.,31,,
285,0.97,1935.967,1955.253,Because workers have been demanding justice for years this is a priority for my office . everyday the city council delays is another day workers are forced to pay a shockingly large portion of their paycheck for the privilege of going to work every day in the form of parking costs.,31,,
286,0.97,1955.253,1961.926,Only to make enormous profits for their bosses.,31,,
287,0.97,1961.926,1964.529,Beyond that there is no clear alternative to sending this legislation directly to the city council.,31,,
288,0.97,1964.529,1969.534,My staff may talk to the office of Councilmember sq.,31,,
289,0.97,1969.534,1975.239,There's also the Council committee overseeing the office of labor standards issue.,31,,
290,0.97,1975.239,1981.346,"As far as we know, they are not available, they would have the capacity to share the bill in the December committee meeting.",31,,
291,0.97,1981.346,1988.753,"Most importantly, it would be acceptable in my view to delay the possible bill.",31,,
292,0.97,1988.753,1993.958,I mean workers would lose the momentum they have built with the courageous strike action by Union carpenters.,31,,
293,0.97,1993.958,2002.367,And by the organization they have done with this community petition and writing Email to the city council . and let's all remember come January there will be new Council committees.,31,,
294,0.97,2002.367,2008.639,Any legislation that has not been acted on this year will have to be Re-Referred at the beginning of 2022.,31,,
295,0.97,2008.639,2018.282,"In other words, we might have to start again next year . The current momentum of the working people will be lost and that is just not okay.",31,,
296,0.97,2018.282,2027.392,It will be an example of the famous Mlk quote that says justice to long-delayed is just just denied.,31,,
297,0.97,2027.392,2037.068,I appreciate the work of Karina pulled from Council central staff and the city attorneys office staff.,31,,
298,0.97,2037.068,2039.37,"Proficiently drafting and reviewing the bill, so it is ready for the city Council to take action on.",31,,
299,0.97,2039.37,2050.715,Especially appreciate the activism of the hundreds of construction workers and hundreds of others in the labor movement who have written to the city Council to demand that this legislation be passed.,31,,
300,0.97,2050.715,2051.816,Our card and have done their jobs.,31,,
301,0.97,2051.816,2056.587,Now it is our turn to Councilmember's turn to do our job.,31,,
302,0.97,2056.587,2066.097,I hope Council members will agree to face this legislation on the referral calendar today and voted into law on November 1ST.,31,,
303,0.97,2066.097,2091.656,"If, however, Council members are not prepared to vote on November 1ST I prepared to make room in the November 30th meeting of my committee to ensure Council members have every opportunity to have whatever discussion you want to have with any community members, any questions you want to run by our office, any discussion that we need to have as Council members . that will give us enough time to pass the bill this year.",31,,
304,0.97,2091.656,2101.265,I just wanted to conclude by saying two things on behalf of the construction workers and community members who are supporting this bill.,31,,
305,0.97,2101.265,2110.975,"One, to note that I believe all of you received a letter from a community member.",31,,
306,0.97,2110.975,2111.909,That letter I just want to read out.,31,,
307,0.97,2111.909,2117.748,It really shows how much support there is for this legislation and why people are supporting it.,31,,
308,0.97,2117.748,2129.794,The second point is to note that we got a letter from a rank-and-file apprentice who is a member of Ibb W-2 46.,31,,
309,0.97,2129.794,2133.898,"A woman Electrician, apprentice who has written to my office.",31,,
310,0.97,2133.898,2137.401,I wanted to share that letter with you all.,31,,
311,0.97,2137.401,2142.306,I will send a letter on Email to all Council members.,31,,
312,0.97,2142.306,2156.621,"I think it's a really excellent example of how a construction worker, young person who is a single parent and who is struggling to get by, who is really struggling to excel in their job and why they feel this is a necessity and what they have heard from their coworkers as well.",31,,
313,0.97,2156.621,2171.836,"As I said, I just want to quickly read the letter from Caroline street, who is a district resident and a member of the 36 legislator of the Democratic party who wrote all Council members this week.",31,,
314,0.97,2171.836,2187.418,"Saying, quote, while the carpet is just one a minimal parking increase in their contract my construction worker friends tell stories of sites, especially in and around Seattle, where the only public slots available cost just over a full hour of their wages in each day.",31,,
315,0.97,2187.418,2193.324,Over the course of a week that amounts to more than half a day of work just to pay for parking.,31,,
316,0.97,2193.324,2195.66,That is clearly absurd.,31,,
317,0.97,2195.66,2208.673,"Contractors should not be allowed to force employees to shoulder the higher cost of doing business in a dense urban area, can you imagine if a play was forced to pay a half of day of wages to park each week?",31,,
318,0.97,2208.673,2210.074,Can you imagine if you were?,31,,
319,0.97,2210.074,2215.546,The alternatives public street parking and mass transit are equally attainable.,31,,
320,0.97,2215.546,2221.185,Mass transit does not work for folks who have to carry heavy tools and protective gear they need to do their jobs.,31,,
321,0.97,2221.185,2226.891,Public Street parking in the ten-hour zones necessary to blood parking tickets filled up by 5:30 A.M.,31,,
322,0.97,2226.891,2239.136,"In order to snag a spot folks who live in our area outside the city, since they can no longer afford to live in the city, must drive in early and sleep in their cars until their shift darts.",31,,
323,0.97,2239.136,2248.312,I go to a gym in South Lake Union and every morning I watch construction workers struggling to find Street parking or sleeping in their cars after doing so.,31,,
324,0.97,2248.312,2250.615,"Again, that is completely unreasonable.",31,,
325,0.97,2250.615,2255.019,I understand the budget discussions are going on right now.,31,,
326,0.97,2255.019,2263.461,This straightforward and vital legislator to shine in support of instruction workers should be passed immediately.,31,,
327,0.97,2263.461,2277.341,Every week that passes without this legislation is a week in which we are allowing wealthy big contractors to push the costs of doing business down to their employees.,31,,
328,0.97,2277.341,2285.049,These folks have families and lives in the fact that they are blue-collar workers who don't work in the city does not mean that we should stand by and allow this distraction of time.,31,,
329,0.97,2285.049,2291.555,Nor should we pretend a delay on our part does not have a substantial material impact on their well-being and well-being of their families.,31,,
330,0.97,2291.555,2312.276,A city that works for everyone is a city that works for everyone who is part of the community that makes the city work for the construction workers who build our city are part of our community and spend most of their waking hours in our city and they're making daily contributions to the future of our city . Even if they cannot afford to live among us.,31,,
331,0.97,2312.276,2314.078,I urge you to support this legislation and to pass it without delay.,31,,
332,0.97,2314.078,2316.681,I just thought that was really important to share.,31,,
333,0.97,2316.681,2329.06,"This is a constituent who is not a construction worker themselves, but who clearly has observed through their experience in the community that construction workers really need this.",31,,
334,0.97,2329.06,2335.566,"As I say, just to reiterate my offer to discuss with Council members whatever you need.",31,,
335,0.97,2335.566,2339.303,I hope that we can pass this legislation in November.,31,,
