53,0.97,556.289,558.758,It is in the hands of corporate landlords demanding these loopholes.,15,,
54,0.97,558.758,567.033,These loopholes mean tenants can be evicted without the landlord being required legally to give clear reason for why they want to Evict them.,15,,
55,0.97,567.033,587.72,"So, I want to thank the office and the Renters' rights movement, many labor unions, for fighting to close these loopholes and just cause protections.",15,,

68,0.97,737.103,740.773,Fixed term contracts are a fair and transparent with attendance and housing providers to manage their relationship.,17,,

78,0.97,781.18,793.092,The policies are creating advantages for deep pocket it corporate investors and are increasingly prohibitive for smaller ones.,17,,
79,0.97,793.092,797.83,"The discussion is not about loopholes, it is about public control of private property, and discouraging community members operating affordable, long-term rentals in Seattle.",17,,

81,0.97,798.23,807.406,Thank you . was there anybody else signed up for public comment?,18,,

84,0.97,814.88,840.873,"Because there is nobody else signed up, I will close the public comment and go on to our first item on the agenda, which is a briefing on just cause Eviction protections from my counsel office, this item is scheduled to be a relatively short item, we wanted to get an overview in preparation for discussions and subsequent committee meetings.",20,,
85,0.97,840.873,855.154,"Ted, if you want to line up the presentation while I am speaking.",20,,
86,0.97,855.154,859.325,"As I said earlier, my office is absolutely committed to closing the loopholes in Seattle prefaced just cause protections this year.",20,,
87,0.97,859.325,916.048,"We have that on the work program at this Committee this year, and we are hoping to bring a community panel to advocate for legislation, and we always welcome small landlords who want to stand with Renters against unfair Evictions and for Renters' rights as a whole, to also contact us, in fact, there is actually several small landlords who have signed our petitions, including the right to counsel, which was an addition organized in the grassroots by real change Seattle and a Socialist alternative, perhaps other organizations, I believe close to 200 people have signed that petition, so, it is an example, also in the Eviction moratorium, officials organized, there were several Mall landlords who signed U saying I don't Evict my tenants, I have never evicted tenants and that I am opposed to corporate landlords Evicting tenants.",20,,
88,0.97,916.048,939.004,"It is important to point out the Renters' rights laws of that my office has worked on, that Renters' rights movements have advocated for, have not affected small landlords adversely, it is precisely meant to address the fact that corporate landlords, big real estate holders, who are the most Evicting landlords.",20,,
89,0.97,939.004,950.049,"To be closed, please start by introducing yourself on the record, then get started with the presentation.",20,,
90,0.97,950.049,970.436,"Ted Virdone, office of Councilmember Sawant, this is a presentation about the just cause Eviction protections, and closing the end of lease loopholes and other loopholes that do exist in those protections.",21,,
91,0.97,970.436,981.847,"In Seattle, there is something called the just cause Eviction ordinance, and that bans Evictions, unless the reason for the Eviction is on a specified list of what is called just causes.",21,,
92,0.97,981.847,1002.468,"If somebody does not pay their rent, there is a process for, that could be a just cause for Eviction, there is also the opportunity for somebody to get caught up on rent according to the just cause Eviction ordinance.",21,,
93,0.97,1002.468,1005.971,As an example of the reasons on that list.,21,,
94,0.97,1005.971,1013.011,"In Washington state, outside of Seattle, in most parts of Washington state, there is no protection like that whatsoever.",21,,
95,0.97,1013.011,1033.399,"In most parts of Washington state, Renters can be Evict it with 20 days notice and what is called a no cause Eviction, in which the landlord does not even need to give, does not even need to say reason, they do not need to make anything up, they can just say, you are you evicted and that is it.",21,,
96,0.97,1033.399,1041.106,"There are some cities that have just cause Eviction protections like Seattle, like Federal way, which I will mention in a moment.",21,,
97,0.97,1041.106,1057.122,"There is a going to the state Úlegislature right now, how spell 1236, which could create some just cause Eviction protections statewide, though it now also has loopholes which we will talk about shortly.",21,,
98,0.97,1057.122,1079.945,"In 2019, Renters in Federal way past a ballot initiative through a grassroots movement, this was organized by Washington labor unions, other rental rights activists that got their signatures to put this initiative on the ballot, knocked on doors and got it past.",21,,
99,0.97,1079.945,1086.251,It created the strongest Eviction just cause Eviction protections that exist in Washington state.,21,,
100,0.97,1086.251,1098.43,We will also talk about that bill as a model of what could be possible.,21,,
101,0.97,1098.43,1110.843,"So, this presentation specifically is about the end of lease loophole, which exists in Seattle, it is based on legal complications that arise from state law, it is not specific to Seattle's lock.",21,,
102,0.97,1110.843,1114.88,"In Seattle, the just cause protections do not stop landlords from refusing to renew a Renter's lease.",21,,
103,0.97,1114.88,1137.803,"They prevent landlords from Evicting people in the middle of the lease, for people on month to month leases without any good cause, but they don't protect people at the end of the lease from just having their lease not renewed for no reason whatsoever.",21,,
104,0.97,1137.803,1149.781,"This committee, the Sustainability and Renters' rights Committee, it does have loophole this year in 2021, I am sure Councilmembers can speak to that.",21,,
105,0.97,1149.781,1157.623,Federal way had a creative way of addressing that end of lease loophole.,21,,
106,0.97,1157.623,1181.079,"The stable homes initiative protects Renters from no cause Evictions, it also closes that loophole by saying that, quote, between 60 and 90 days prior to the expiration of the existing rental term, the landlord must offer a tenant the opportunity to enter into a new rental agreement or extend the existing rental agreement.",21,,
107,0.97,1181.079,1224.59,"Essentially, you never get to that end of lease situation, because without good cause, because of this portion of the stable homes initiative, which is a really good approach to closing that loophole . The corporate landlords lobby did do basically everything they could do to stop this initiative from being enacted, not only did the campaign against the passage, they sued to attempt to keep it off the ballot, failed to do that, and once it was passed by voters, they sued to try and prevent it from going into effect, that lawsuit was launched in December of 2019 and is still going on.",21,,
108,0.97,1224.59,1227.993,The trial date is currently set for July 12th of this year.,21,,
109,0.97,1227.993,1235.901,That will hopefully be resolved in favor of the Renters shortly.,21,,
110,0.97,1235.901,1245.911,"Washington state how spell 1236, so, this creates some just cause Eviction protections statewide.",21,,
111,0.97,1245.911,1265.197,"We should keep in mind, the status quo this is going, this is coming from, is the statewide rental laws are so stacked against tenants that right now, a Renter who has done nothing wrong can be evicted with only 20 days notice.",21,,
112,0.97,1265.197,1301.566,"In many ways, this statewide bill, it does speak to the end of lease loophole, it does say that, at the end of some leases, they need to be renewed or they become month to month, except it allows landlords to Evict without cause after the initial lease, as rents have gone up so rapidly, many Renters are on their first lease, and this loophole is not closed for the first lease.",21,,
113,0.97,1301.566,1302.367,In its current form.,21,,
114,0.97,1302.367,1362.294,"It was passed by the house, it is now in the Senate . There are other differences between 1236 and Seattle's just cause, that would be worth the committee understanding what 1236 has, in many ways, a longer list of reasons why, that are, that landlords are allowed to use Evict people, including some reasons that are quite loosely defined, for example, illegitimate economic business reason is a reason why Evictions would be allowed under House bill 1236, and there is not any definition of what counts as a legitimate economic or business reason.",21,,
115,0.97,1362.294,1399.564,"There are other things that were put into 1236 as amendments in the house as it was being voted on, for example, if a tenant has been required to register as a sex offender, they can be evicted for that reason, and there are other differences between Seattle's Eviction, there are Úother defenses against infection that exist in Seattle that are not considered by hospital 1236, like the ban on winter Evictions, that the grassroots movement won and we put forward at the beginning of 2020.",21,,
116,0.97,1399.564,1426.091,"And that past, that ran on winter Evictions, it is not covered by 1236, and there is, in Seattle, there is a defense against Evictions for the first six months after the Eviction moratorium ends, if you are being evicted for Covid-19 related economic hardship.",21,,
117,0.97,1426.091,1435.0,"That is an issue, there are other bills that are discussing that issue, but it is not covered by this bill.",21,,
118,0.97,1435.0,1441.139,"Before you go on, I believe Councilmember Juarez has a point.",22,,
119,0.97,1441.139,1445.977,"I was trying to, I apologize for not using the hand thing, I was raising my hand it you didn't see me.",23,,
120,0.97,1445.977,1471.736,"Just so I am clear on that first slide, when you were going back to the just cause Eviction, and of lease loopholes, so, yes, so, basically what you're saying is that you want to give the Renter a right to, if you will, a rollover rental option.",23,,
121,0.97,1471.736,1473.538,A month to month.,23,,
122,0.97,1473.538,1497.762,"Yeah, if they have been, Yeah, either rolling over into month to month or having a renewed lease, maybe it becomes another 12 month term, or however, one way or the other.",24,,
123,0.97,1497.762,1501.466,"Okay, I just wanted to get the language correct, Okay, that is what I was clarifying, Vicki.",25,,
124,0.97,1501.466,1506.671,"Actually, just on that question, that is what you are pointing out, in Federal way, that is the way they wrote the language, right?",26,,
125,0.97,1506.671,1507.939,That is what I thought.,27,,
126,0.97,1507.939,1509.341,I wasn't sure I knew the answer.,27,,
127,0.97,1509.341,1510.809,"Ted, can you confirm that?",28,,
128,0.97,1510.809,1518.083,Yeah.,29,,
129,0.97,1518.083,1522.754,"Here, it says the landlord must offer the tenant the opportunity to enter into a new rental agreement or extend the existing.",29,,
130,0.97,1522.754,1523.788,There it is.,30,,
131,0.97,1523.788,1524.189,Okay.,30,,
132,0.97,1524.189,1550.382,"It is basically a right to a rollover option, you can't just say you have to go because your lease is up, you've got to give them, you can't just them, by right, I kind of assumed this right of tenancy and unless you have a good reason and I want to extend it either month to month or a lease, I should be allowed the opportunity.",30,,
133,0.97,1550.382,1550.649,Rate.,31,,
134,0.97,1550.649,1550.982,Exactly.,32,,
135,0.97,1550.982,1560.125,"If you are a Renter in good standing, if the landlord is still going to continue to rent that unit, then, yes, you should have the right.",33,,
136,0.97,1560.125,1569.301,"Right of first refusal, Okay, think.",34,,
137,0.97,1569.301,1570.101,"Go ahead, Ted.",35,,
138,0.97,1570.101,1572.637,I think this is the slide we are on.,36,,
139,0.97,1572.637,1614.98,"So far, in our office, we have investigated closing this end of lease loophole for several years, including monitoring the Federal way stable housing initiative we have discussed so far and the just cause Eviction ordinance attempts statewide, there is the current bill, how spell 1236, we discussed today, but also over the past two years, there have been attempts to create just cause Eviction Detections statewide that have not succeeded in passing.",36,,
140,0.97,1614.98,1617.048,But bills of that nature have been discussed in Olympia.,36,,
141,0.97,1617.048,1644.476,"We have also, of course, discussed with community and our organizers and Renters and the city attorney's office to discuss those issues, and we are obviously quite excited to have the opportunity to finally close this loophole in 2021 as Úfederal way's legislation becomes finalized and also as stated bills work their way through the Legislature.",36,,
142,0.97,1644.476,1697.128,"The next step for the upcoming Sustainability and Renters' rights Committee, this committee will hear from Renters and community organizers about closing end of lease loopholes and other improvements to Seattle's just cause Eviction protections, we will monitor the progress and the progress of how spell 1236, hopefully advocate for those really glaring loopholes to be closed, so, so, the just cause protections can exist statewide, and we will ultimately discuss a vote on legislation to strengthen protections in Seattle",36,,
143,0.97,1698.129,1732.597,"I believe that was your last slide, I just want to clarify, for anybody looking at the presentation that we shared before, when the agenda was published, we have since, the presentation just provided was an updated version, because it was since published, the agenda we found out from staff about the new amendments that have passed in the state house bill, which really just changed the character of the bill entirely as the presentation showed just now from Ted.",37,,
144,0.97,1732.597,1791.523,"In fact, both of us, we spoke yesterday in the legislative agenda briefing that the city council had from staff about the state bill and, in fact, just to quote Councilmember, who I thought described it really well, is, she is referring to the Seattle loophole, which is basically people who are in term leases don't have just cause protections, and that is, I actually had a question about that, I don't know if Ted has an answer, something we should research, I think, for this Committee, but as was stated, actually the bill in the state Legislature no longer fixes the Seattle loophole, which is what the original version would have done, but actually places the problem language in the state for.",37,,
145,0.97,1791.523,1828.593,"In other words, yes, right now, in the state, the status quo is that no Renters have just cause protections, but you can be evicted with no notice and less than 20 days, but at the same time, what the state law currently does is it introduces highly problematic language, and as Seattle is concerned, it does not provide fixing the loophole, it would be ideal if the law had full-fledged Non- loophole protections from all, but that has happened, this is quite problematic.",37,,
146,0.97,1828.593,1842.907,"On that point, on one of the main loopholes that has been introduced in state law, where people on term leases to have just cause protection, except for their initial lease.",37,,
147,0.97,1842.907,1861.392,"That really is problematic, because what is to prevent landlords from Evicting people in the initial lease, because that is the loophole, but I think a numerical question, a statistical question we need to ask is what percentage of tenants in Seattle are, on average, on term leases every year.",37,,
148,0.97,1861.392,1878.443,"We spoke to organizers and they believe that is the majority of Renters in Seattle who are term leases, I just wanted to give Ted a chance to let us know if there is any research we have from our office about that.",37,,
149,0.97,1878.443,1900.765,"I don't have those numbers, but I'm happy to look them up and provide them to the committee when we get them.",38,,
150,0.97,1900.765,1910.942,"That would be really good, because, it will give us a sense of what proportion of Seattle residents would be affected potentially by the exclusion of first time term leases, and also, that would give as a guidance to what kind of law we should pass in Seattle.",39,,
151,0.97,1910.942,1911.943,I am looking for hands.,39,,
152,0.97,1911.943,1912.377,"Oh, go ahead.",39,,
153,0.97,1912.377,1913.478,And I Unmute it?,40,,
154,0.97,1913.478,1913.711,Yes.,40,,
155,0.97,1913.711,1914.279,Okay.,40,,
156,0.97,1914.279,1919.284,"Thank you, I want to thank you and your staff for all the work you have done.",40,,
157,0.97,1919.284,2030.161,"Following this piece of legislation and sharing that information, especially on the state legislation, I think it is really important to close the loophole, because we know it lease tenants without any sort of just cause protections from I just want to also thank you for your continued focus on this issue, we have to bring just cause protections to all tenants regardless of the lease term or type, and it is something that we have also been working on since I took office, which is as long as you, but Nevertheless, I think it is really important for us to continue this work and just, as I had mentioned in briefing yesterday, my office started these conversations before the pandemic began, so, we restarted at the beginning of this year, my staff has been working with Renters and organizers and advocates and attorneys from the statehouse stay healthy coalition, to bring some legislation before counsel for the end of the Eviction moratorium, so, I do want to let our committee colleagues know we have been meeting with law and central staff to move forward on this, last week, central staff started drafting some legislation on behalf of our office and she will hopefully have that to us soon, Stakeholders we have been working with and we have drafted our base legislation and consultation with them, out of respect for their planning process, the group isn't really ready to share the legislation yet.",40,,
158,0.97,2030.161,2040.104,"But I do want to let our committee members know, as soon as that is ready for sharing, we will have that out to you as soon as possible.",40,,
159,0.97,2040.104,2049.013,"We do want to say, finally, this is an important step in fixing many of the issues that were just cause Eviction ordinance house, and we need it be for the end of the moratorium.",40,,
160,0.97,2049.013,2102.867,"Our community members want it written so it withstands any kind of challenge, so, we are working diligently and meticulously to make sure that the community gets what they want, want to make sure it reflects their wishes, and that our Council colleagues get their questions answered, so that we can pass this legislation when it comes for us, so, I look forward to this conversation, I know my staff has spoken to your staff to just express our desire to work closely with you on this, I just want to say, absolutely in this meeting, that we are really looking forward to working with you and to try to get this done so we can make sure our community members have we are fixing this piece of our just cause Eviction ordinance.",40,,
161,0.97,2102.867,2104.669,Thank you.,41,,
162,0.97,2104.669,2172.336,"As I have said before, we are very happy to work together with your office, glad you are supporting this and it is not a question of the longevity on the Council, it is a question of being, having elected representatives willing to fight corporate landlords and willing to stand with Renters, so, I welcome you and any other Councilmember who wants to do what we have done in the last seven years, which is genuinely take on the power of corporate landlords, but not as an individual, but really organizing Renters, which are the only basis for us to win victories that were not, we won the payment plan, doesn't sound sexy, but the number of Renters who have come up to me just randomly at grocery stores or while going on a walk, saying the movement made a huge difference to them, just to be able to move into an apartment is just overwhelming, the number of Renters who have given us feedback.",41,,
163,0.97,2172.336,2200.965,"There was an example of a law we were able to win, only because we organized with Washington community action network, Renters who are not affiliated with the organization but want to fight for workers that also were high salary but very young.",41,,
164,0.97,2200.965,2202.033,It made a huge difference.,41,,
165,0.97,2202.033,2205.57,"And ended up creating unity, which means more highly paid worker and lower paid workers.",41,,
166,0.97,2205.57,2240.004,"Similarly, they are too numerous to mention here, so just cause, closing the just cause loopholes is crucial, and I really agree with you that we want to make sure that it withstands any challenge, we are not going to be able to do it through legal measures, it has to be a strong law legally speaking, the but at the end of the day, every Renters' rights law has been challenged because of the high level of community support, I think that is our task as well.",41,,
167,0.97,2240.004,2247.778,"Holding that community support through Renter, recognizing there is no option but to fight corporate landlords.",41,,
168,0.97,2247.778,2255.953,"Since we are over time, I will move on to the next item, because we will come back to this discussion in subsequent committees.",41,,
169,0.97,2255.953,2272.903,"Our next item will be a discussion with the Seattle office of Sustainability environment about their greenhouse gas inventory, which essentially attracts every metric of Co2 and other greenhouse gases that cause climate change and are produced in Seattle.",41,,
170,0.97,2272.903,2298.462,"They will talk about their finding and about their work in the coming year, I would also like to recognize that they have run a hugely important grocery voucher, which has helped thousands of families to stay Fed, especially in this time of the pandemic.",41,,
171,0.97,2298.462,2300.464,That was an emergency task they took on.,41,,
172,0.97,2300.464,2308.272,My office really appreciates all the work the staff have done to make that a success.,41,,
173,0.97,2308.272,2313.577,Would our Presenters please introduce yourselves and take it away?,41,,
174,0.97,2313.577,2317.181,"Assure, thank you so much.",42,,
175,0.97,2317.181,2326.09,"I am Michelle Caulfield, I am the interim director, newly interim director for the office of Sustainability and environment.",42,,

179,0.97,2355.119,2356.787,"All right, we've got our team together.",46,,
180,0.97,2356.787,2371.469,"I will kick us off, I want to first start by saying counsel number 1018, thank you, in particular, thank you for recognizing the work of the emergency grocery voucher program.",46,,
181,0.97,2371.469,2384.815,Want to also call out that that has been a really important partnership and it feels really great to be able to pivot and serve the needs of our community during a really difficult temperament also going to call out our former director who was a big champion for that program as well.,46,,
182,0.97,2384.815,2395.559,"Of course, the Mayor, who led that to be launched in March soon after the pandemic hit.",46,,
183,0.97,2395.559,2408.139,"So, thank you so much for your time, we are really excited to be here, I know our office, the office of Sustainability and environment, hasn't been for this community for some time, it is an honor to be here and to be here with this amazing team from the office of Sustainability and environment.",46,,
184,0.97,2408.139,2409.64,You will hear from all of us today.,46,,
185,0.97,2409.64,2427.725,"Why don't we focus on, here is our agenda for what we hope to cover, we are going to focus on the climate and environmental justice work Today.,",46,,
186,0.97,2448.045,2462.426,"Good afternoon, Councilmembers, I will be providing an overview of our justice work and talk a little bit about some of our priorities we have lined up this year.",47,,
187,0.97,2462.426,2479.844,"Regarding our approach to climate justice, the office of Sustainability and environment is building on the foundation of our equity and environment initiative to more closely align the guiding principles and strategies to outline in the equity environment agenda, with our work to address climate change.",47,,
188,0.97,2479.844,2502.433,It is clear to us that the work we need to address climate change must also yield solutions that affect the health and well-being of the people and the planet through economic opportunity while actively seeking to dismantle institutionalized and systemic racism by putting forth the solutions center racial equity.,47,,
189,0.97,2502.433,2504.468,Those are the principles and values that guide our work.,47,,
190,0.97,2504.468,2508.739,I would like to start by talking a little bit about the staff working the support.,47,,
191,0.97,2508.739,2521.685,"First, I want to recognize and I am incredibly honored to work with such an amazing team of really passionate people.",47,,
192,0.97,2521.685,2534.298,"The folks supporting the equity and environment initiative have dynamic expertise and experience in environmental justice, climate justice, youth development, immigrant and right, refugee rights, data ANALYTICS, and policy, and so much more.",47,,
193,0.97,2534.298,2551.982,"We work in an Interdisciplinary fashion, and we partner with colleagues across and our city colleagues to inform and create strategies that are Intersectional and that advance environmental and climate justice.",47,,
194,0.97,2551.982,2571.502,"I just want to shine a light on these incredible folks are just a minute, I myself have been here for a little over a year and a half, and I have been in the climate justice for over a year.",47,,
195,0.97,2571.502,2586.65,"Ani Krishnan is our climate and data policy manager and oversees the city's greenhouse gas inventory, which we will talk about, and our climate data reporting, as well as some work linked to the Mayor's green new deal executive order, which will also talk more about.",47,,
196,0.97,2586.951,2611.809,"Five weeks ago, we Onboard Lisa Chen as our new equity and environment manager, she oversees the strategic develop in the direction of the environmental justice grant Fund.",48,,
197,0.97,2611.809,2615.779,She is responsible for the strategic oversight coordination as well as the green new deal oversight board.,48,,
198,0.97,2615.779,2640.671,"Three weeks ago, we Onboard it Jose Vasquez, who has joined the team as our green new deal advisor, and he was speaking little more about his role later on in the presentation, but I would like to mention he comes to us with really great experience from the office of immigrant and refugee affairs.",48,,
199,0.97,2640.671,2657.421,"Jose was also a founding member of our environmental justice Committee, and we were directly involved in the development of the equity environment initiative as community leaders before we started at the city.",48,,
200,0.97,2657.421,2664.328,It is really a blessing to be able to work again with these two.,48,,
201,0.97,2664.328,2692.756,"This year marks five years since the release of the equity and environment agenda, since that time, we have been humbled to deeply, to deepen our partnerships with Seattle's black Indigenos and communities of color, if you go to the next slide, we have an incredible environmental justice Committee who is working with us on topics related to food justice and equitable pathways for youth of color, those are their priorities.",48,,
202,0.97,2692.756,2706.503,"So far this year, the committee has provided input on the expansion process of the fresh books neighborhood program.",48,,
203,0.97,2707.004,2714.878,"Through the environmental justice Fund and our partnership, we distributed over $1 million to support environmental justice and environmental protection work led by and for Communitis of color.",48,,
204,0.97,2714.878,2724.855,"This year, we will be working to stand up the green new deal oversight board, a green new deal Department team, as well as develop key climate indicators that will inform a public facing dashboard.",48,,
205,0.97,2724.855,2733.597,"We will also be working to support other important climate action work that we are Partnering with other departments on, which Michelle will discuss later on.",48,,
206,0.97,2733.597,2751.014,I just wanted to provide that overview for us and say that we are truly excited to work with you all and with it the new members of the green new deal oversight board to develop a vision for climate justice for Seattle's communities.,48,,
207,0.97,2751.014,2757.521,Thank you.,49,,
208,0.97,2757.521,2763.227,"Good afternoon, I'm going to be walking you through our most recent greenhouse gas inventory report.",49,,
209,0.97,2763.227,2776.039,"Will discuss some changes that we made on the back and, in terms of how we collect and analyze the data, some updates to our web presence, and finally talk about what our 2018 inventory numbers are telling us.",49,,
210,0.97,2776.039,2801.932,"So, data, structure migrations is something we embarked on over the past couple of years, our inventory reports have traditionally been very Time- consuming to prepare for every inventory year, there are countless data sources to Revisit, files to update, and Visuals to Re-Create, most of this work has happened manually.",49,,
211,0.97,2801.932,2812.176,"In an effort to improve this process, we migrated our data structure from exclusively XL to combination XL and power, which is similar and available to use free for city employees.",49,,
212,0.97,2812.176,2841.872,"What we have been able to achieve is just better efficiency collecting data, ease of replicating charts and graphics for future inventory years, packing a lot more information into those Visuals, and with the end goal of making that information more accessible to everyone, our constituents, our program policy creatures, and so on.",49,,
213,0.97,2841.872,2875.339,"This Outmigration also gave us the ingredients we needed to really revamp our web presence, so we went from what was a very static performance monitoring Webpage, where there is a brief paragraph about our missions and links to our Pdf reports, too much more dynamic Website where users can interact with the data through responsible Visuals, the one we developed, learn about the context and our key actions that we are undertaking without necessarily needing to Download the reports.",49,,
214,0.97,2875.339,2886.75,"All of this stuff is on our Website, but for the precise of this presentation, I will walk you through a couple of those, a few of those Visuals just to show you what they are about.",49,,
215,0.97,2886.75,2898.328,"So, this first one clocks of the percentage change of emissions, along with population and GDP from our baseline year of 2008.",49,,
216,0.97,2898.328,2900.964,"All the way up to 2018, which was our most recent inventory year.",49,,
217,0.97,2900.964,2910.474,"What we are seeing is modest decreases in emissions over the past decade, despite the fact or population and economy has really skyrocketed.",49,,
218,0.97,2910.474,2945.008,"This next visual shows us those same trends categorized by what we call our three four sectors, which are buildings, transportation, and you can see the relative difference in contribution of emissions based on the size of these colored areas, we've got buildings down below in purple, transportation in blue, and that little Sliver of yellow at top.",49,,
219,0.97,2945.008,2954.785,"The cool thing about these Visuals is that users are able to filter through, depending on the sector they want to look at, whether they want to look at just core, versus extended omissions, and also select the specific year for which they want this text to update by.",49,,
220,0.97,2954.785,2959.489,All of this stuff is easily accessible on our Website.,49,,
221,0.97,2959.489,2969.633,"And then, moving on to the next visual, we can see this overall breakdown of our core emissions by sector.",49,,
222,0.97,2969.633,2988.518,"Again, users have the ability to drill down to specific sectors by clicking on those buttons on the left, for example, we click on the buildings button, it takes them to the buildings where we have, you see her on the next slide what that looks like.",49,,
223,0.97,2988.518,2990.354,Just a little more detailed information for that sector.,49,,
224,0.97,2990.354,3000.931,"What we are seeing here on this slide in his emissions and the building sector for both commercial and residential on the left, and the fuel source of those emissions on the right.",49,,
225,0.97,3000.931,3009.239,And one of the key things we want to highlight in this particular side is the interaction between these two Visuals.,49,,
226,0.97,3009.239,3026.89,"If the user clicks, for example, as I've taken a Screenshot, if the user clicks on fossil gas, which shows 86% of emissions come from fossil gas in the building sector, it highlights the corresponding portion of those emissions by sector.",49,,
227,0.97,3026.89,3036.867,"So, this sort of Interactivity exists across all of the Visuals within the dashboard on the Website.",49,,
228,0.97,3036.867,3037.868,Just wanted to showcase that.,49,,
229,0.97,3037.868,3051.081,"Also, use that particular point as a Segway to relate what the key insights are that we notice from 2016 to 2018, which are two inventory years.",49,,
230,0.97,3051.081,3061.024,"Overall, our emissions across those sectors went up by about 1.1%.",49,,
231,0.97,3061.024,3071.001,"But the really, the big news is, in our building sector, because building sector emissions rose by over 80%, and this is primarily happened due to an increase of fossil gas use.",49,,
232,0.97,3071.001,3085.015,"One of the key points we always like to emphasize here is drawing that connection between actual energy consumed by fuel source and the resulting omissions, and this graphic on the right tries to show that discrepancy.",49,,
233,0.97,3085.015,3097.894,"We get the majority of our energy from electricity, but that electricity contributes very little in terms of emissions.",49,,
234,0.97,3097.894,3101.665,"You see that 104,000 metric tons of Co2, all of that is off set.",49,,
235,0.97,3101.665,3118.648,"What that means is we get 43% of our energy from fossil gas, that Gasis responsible for 86 or 94% depending on whether you are counting city light or not.",49,,
236,0.97,3118.648,3128.258,"Any time our use increases, the link sector emissions increase almost hand in hand.",49,,
237,0.97,3128.258,3137.4,"So, we really need to think about tackling that problem.",49,,
238,0.97,3137.4,3150.68,"In our transportation sector, our emissions reduced by 2.4%, and we think this is due to slightly more efficient miles per gallon values we got from and less vehicles and miles traveled.",49,,
239,0.97,3150.68,3158.922,"What is important to know is our transportation data is modeled, not measured.",49,,
240,0.97,3158.922,3174.471,"There is some uncertainty whether this model, which was quite, it was updated last year, it doesn't take into account Ride-Share.",49,,
241,0.97,3174.471,3176.806,That value should be looked at with that caveat in mind.,49,,
242,0.97,3176.806,3212.576,"Then Finally, waste emissions dropped by almost 10%, which is a Testament to the good work our public utilities Department has been doing, and it is also worth mentioning this is a geographic inventory, so we are not really accounting for the emissions that take place when you purchase a product and it is shipped to you from abroad, so the manufacturing cost of things are not included in this particular inventory report.",49,,
243,0.97,3212.576,3216.379,"So, where do those numbers leave us?",49,,
244,0.97,3216.379,3241.972,"We know what our emissions reduction targets are, with, through the climate action plan process, we are shooting for 58% reduction by 2030, which has been supplanted by the goal in the green new deal, which is, we are trying to shoot for Seattle being a fossil fuel free city by 2030.",49,,
245,0.97,3241.972,3250.113,And we have reinforced those targets for all of our commitments to climate planning.,49,,
246,0.97,3250.113,3280.61,"Despite our best efforts, our rate of reduction needs to be a whole lot faster than what it currently is if we want to get to our target, what this chart is showing as is that we have reduced omissions, and remember, despite experiencing an increase in population and GDP, but we need to be at 17 times our current annual reduction rate for total core emissions to get to our target.",49,,
247,0.97,3280.61,3286.65,That same 17 number applies even to our building sector emissions.,49,,
248,0.97,3286.65,3289.619,It is dirty for our transportation sector.,49,,
249,0.97,3289.619,3328.558,"So, we know what we have to do, pointing back to the point about Electrification, we need across both of these sectors and both transportation and our building sectors, that is Billy how we are going to get to our goals, both Jose and Michelle are going to talk about that a little more, I also just want to end this data section by acknowledging that not hitting our targets affects our communities disproportionately.",49,,
250,0.97,3328.558,3337.267,"We know that the most significant Predictor of a person living near contaminated air, water, or soil is raced.",49,,
251,0.97,3337.267,3346.009,We also know this is especially true in Seattle where 50% of the population that lives within one mile of the boundary are people of color.,49,,
252,0.97,3346.009,3364.094,"So, we just want to acknowledge that and acknowledge that all the work we are doing is in stopping, I wonder if this is a good moment to pause and take questions specifically on the data before we dive into the next section.",49,,
253,0.97,3364.094,3413.643,"I think the Statistics you have provided are, I mean, it is really start and I feel like, I always have a problem with reconciling the steep progress that needs to be made that is not being made with small amount of progress that we are making and celebrating it, I don't, I think every progress we can make is crucial, but I think your slide, if you can go back to that slide, I don't know which number, Yeah, both those slides, which show the cold emissions and also the building, Yeah, all of those slides.",50,,
254,0.97,3413.643,3432.495,"The Steepness of that curve that you have to take, undertake and comparing that to the shallowness, that is just a start.",50,,
255,0.97,3432.495,3480.043,"If we are talking about the planet's survival, it is simply not enough, and I wonder if you could talk a little more about, what are the aggressive moves the city needs to make in order to address this and this is also in light of the fact that, the transportation, as you currently have in your slide, is one of the major sources, but it is not due to lack of commitment of ordinary people that this hasn't happened, a lot of people actually, they have reduced over the last decade or so, Ridership per hour measure, has actually gone up, and people are more committed than they were before.",50,,
256,0.97,3480.043,3501.564,"It is really not a problem of ordinary people understanding how important this is, it is just very hard for people to completely make the switch to public transportation, because it is just not at the point where it needs to be, unlike some other cities where it is pretty dramatically different.",50,,
257,0.97,3501.564,3508.471,"But this is obviously linked to the global climate challenge, it is not just Seattle.",50,,
258,0.97,3508.471,3530.26,"In Seattle, to get to the 58% reduction you have talked about, how, how can you, are you able to quantify how much the city will, for example, need to reduce its dependence on gas?",50,,
259,0.97,3530.26,3547.911,"Concretely, we will need to move away from gas, that is one, we will need to dramatically increase investments in public transportation in order to make that change possible, need to do building Retrofits.",50,,
260,0.97,3547.911,3552.515,Each of these requires concrete moves of for the city to make.,50,,
261,0.97,3552.515,3575.438,"I do want to recognize that you will be diving into some of our specific efforts . I can broadly mention that, for our building sector here, you are absolutely right, we need to essentially eliminate fossil gas use in our existing residential and commercial buildings.",51,,
262,0.97,3575.438,3611.207,"One of the winds we recently had, recently passed energy codes, the biggest piece of the pie is an existing building, we have to tackle that, and on the transportation side, we really need to be taking sort of a deer pronged approach to reduced on road as well as broadly electrifying that remains, I do want to Posit to you, Michelle.",51,,
263,0.97,3611.207,3626.889,I think that is exactly right and I think this is why we are so excited about a Communitywide partnership to look at how do we take some of these steps.,52,,
264,0.97,3626.889,3668.431,"I know we have made some progress over time, but you get to a point where you have done all the low hanging fruit, the next step is real deep change, part of what we are trying to do with our climate justice work and our environmental justice work is making sure we make these deep shifts in our economy in ways that don't burden black, indigenous, and people of color, communities we set up the right kinds of tools, and resources to make these transitions happen, so, you know, we are talking about real change and it is change that will require, not just the city of Seattle, it will require King County, the state, the Federal Government, all sectors of our economy, including the voices of those most impacted by climate injustice.",52,,
265,0.97,3668.431,3687.25,"So, and the Electrification mentions that you were making earlier, you will see those themes in the things we are doing, and we are making progress.",52,,
266,0.97,3687.25,3694.157,"There's a lot more that needs to be made and that is definitely, it should be done in partnership across the community.",52,,
267,0.97,3694.157,3700.463,Any other questions on the data?,53,,
268,0.97,3700.463,3702.665,"I don't see any hands up, so please go ahead.",54,,
269,0.97,3702.665,3703.266,Rate.,55,,
270,0.97,3703.266,3731.761,"So, really quickly, we are going to dive into the green new deal work, but one of the initiatives that is related to the inventory that I would like to mention is the fact that we are developing these key climate indicators with the view of collecting more frequent and granular climate data.",55,,
271,0.97,3731.761,3756.919,"You might be wondering why we are sitting here telling you about a 2018 data updated 2220 21, and we recognize that, sort of constraints our planning as well, so, we are on the lookout for more frequent data we can rely on and report on like a quarterly basis and we want to Contextualize, knowing fully well climate change doesn't affect everyone equally.",55,,
272,0.97,3756.919,3787.55,"We want to Contextualize this data with equity Metrics, things like race and social equity index, and adding in constituent stories that really create a narrative for why it is important for us to tackle these issues and with that, I will pass it over to Jose, who will talk more eloquently about the green new deal work.",55,,
273,0.97,3787.55,3794.924,"Yes, thank you and thank you everybody for having us here.",56,,
274,0.97,3794.924,3849.779,"I'm extremely excited to have joined this team, not just ask somebody who's part of those initial conversations, I'm excited to have joined here . We are really excited now that we are building our team, having some very lofty goals ahead of us to bring together that ownership and bring those voices of those communities most impacted by climate change, communities of color, black indigenous people of color, immigrants, refugees, individuals who have families from low income communities.",56,,
275,0.97,3849.779,3864.994,"Every year, we see new data that keeps coming up but is showing more drastically how urgent this work is and how intentional we need to be in including those expertise and lived experiences, first and foremost in this work.",56,,
276,0.97,3864.994,3882.445,"We are really excited to be leading this work, also to bring together new economic opportunities, as we shift to a new economy, and as we move forward, to implement a lot of these policy recommendations, budget recommendations that are going to come out.",56,,
277,0.97,3882.445,3905.067,"We definitely want to continue leading these efforts, public utilities, other departments across the city through our green new deal, alongside the oversight board, which we are hoping to start an open call for applications launching tomorrow.",56,,
278,0.97,3905.067,3907.169,"So, we are really excited to announce that.",56,,
279,0.97,3907.169,3919.882,"For me, we are getting ready to open call for applications for 11 of our current 19 seeds we have for the green new deal oversight board.",56,,
280,0.97,3919.882,3931.794,"If we move to the next slide, I will give a little bit of an overview of what that application process looks like.",56,,
281,0.97,3931.794,3944.006,We are currently looking for applicants who want to join the green new deal oversight board to help us as the city defines what constitutes a policy program or project that advances the green new deal for Seattle.,56,,
282,0.97,3944.006,3954.116,"Also looking for proposals on new policies to advance, and support the planning and implementing of the action.",56,,
283,0.97,3954.116,3959.622,We want to bring in new ideas from the community.,56,,
284,0.97,3959.622,3973.636,To help achieve our goals of also becoming a climate pollution free by 2030 and making those city budget and legislative recommendations to us through the deal oversight board.,56,,
285,0.97,3973.636,3987.049,"So, the green new deal oversight board will be made up of 19 members appointed by both the Mayor's office and the city council.",56,,
286,0.97,3987.049,4003.132,"They will be appointed today during the Council meeting, the office has already initiated the process, we look forward to continuing that partnership.",56,,
287,0.97,4003.132,4034.563,"We are currently looking to fill 11 of the vacant seats available, three from the front link communities directly impacted by climate change, one tribal representative, two youth, two representatives from organizations that are deeply involved in environmental justice, three Union representatives from the labor movement, and two specialists designated for representatives experiencing greenhouse gas reduction.",56,,
288,0.97,4034.563,4079.508,"And one final position, somebody who specializes in workforce training, and we're looking forward to bringing these representatives together to help move this work forward, as I mentioned earlier, we are really excited to announce tomorrow we are going to be opening up the application for about 3 1/2 weeks before we do our application review and interview process to hopefully have before cancel our recommended appointments, hopefully sometime during the month of May to hopefully achieve our goal of having our first green new deal oversight.",56,,
289,0.97,4079.508,4088.818,"With that, I want to take a minute to pause and see if there are any questions about the work we have in front of us to fill these 19 seats for the oversight board or any other questions in general,",56,,
290,0.97,4088.818,4124.587,"Thank you for that presentation, will come to some of the appointments in a few minutes, and I know there is a question or comment, before that, just, I was wondering if you have an estimate of the number of jobs that will be created, including apprenticeship opportunities with electrification program that is on the scale we need, and, you know, when I say skill, I mean the goals we need to reach in order to actually address climate change.",57,,
291,0.97,4124.587,4161.49,"Those are the three key grabs you have come in not enough for all of us, but what actually we need, and as you said, the communities most immediately affected are very low income communities, communities of color, and so, it is important that the organizations, many of whom are still involved in the fight against climate change in Seattle, were also in a successfully led priority higher apprenticeship.",57,,
292,0.97,4161.49,4188.884,"It was, my office is honored to be alongside on that, given all of that, I think the question of jobs in climate renewal approach is crucial, because we need to unite the climate adjustment movement and that is why it is important in the positions open, we are going to talk about, there are labor positions.",57,,
293,0.97,4188.884,4224.887,"We need to have a transition, in fact, one of the things we noted through our research, something that was highlighted tremendously to that incident and also the Greenwood incident a few years ago, is how dangerous the jobs are for workers themselves in these fossil fuel industries, and in fact, we have a friend who works at the plant who says about the fossil fuel workers, they call that Olfactory the bomb.",57,,
294,0.97,4224.887,4247.042,"They have incidents required to evacuate, but many are not required, so, they also play fast and loose with the safety laws as well, and given all of this, the question of jobs is paramount if we are to build a powerful movement.",57,,
295,0.97,4247.042,4263.192,"If you can give us a sense of if we have a full-fledged program, what is the estimate, and it is fine if we don't have it now, just go back and look at that.",57,,
296,0.97,4263.192,4286.048,"Thank you so much for that, I think you are absolutely right, we are so excited to have Jose on board who has some working with labor and like, workforce job transition is the next frontier of the climate work, and I want to call in a couple of things happening, I don't have that information for you right now, but a couple things just for Councilmembers to be aware of.",58,,
297,0.97,4286.048,4307.169,"There is a fossil fuel free study that I believe is on the slide under the Electrification slide coming later, that the office of economic development has been working on, I believe that is slated to come to counsel the end of this month, if not, April, but I am sorry to say, I'm not exactly sure which committee that is up to.",58,,
298,0.97,4307.169,4315.678,That is one study that is in draft form and being reviewed and will be in all of our hands very soon.,58,,
299,0.97,4315.678,4335.197,"Through some of the Electrification work we are doing, looking at strategies for electrifying existing buildings, there is grant funding and partnership work we are doing with Emerald cities to look at what other workforce opportunities with Electrification and buildings, that is on our Workplan to do this year.",58,,
300,0.97,4335.197,4346.742,We will have data through that study as well.,58,,
301,0.97,4347.876,4356.952,"I know there is one more, under the related study, it is not so much about jobs, but it is the ways we subsidize fossil fuels in our programs and policies, that is also going to be part of the work we are leading this year.",58,,
302,0.97,4356.952,4374.436,"I've written down a note on that call for the jobs and what data we have on jobs and I definitely feel like we will come back to you with any information we have right now, and we definitely will be sharing and working with you on those studies as they get underway this year.",58,,
303,0.97,4374.436,4377.439,"I really appreciate that, looking forward to following up with you.",59,,
304,0.97,4377.439,4382.544,Thank you.,59,,
305,0.97,4382.544,4390.052,Councilmember Morales is next.,59,,
306,0.97,4390.052,4406.935,"I want to first just to welcome all the new folks on board, it is really exciting to see, congratulations for meeting this amazing team, I know Liliana and Lisa and Jose from previous work, it is good to see everybody on board here.",60,,
307,0.97,4406.935,4441.27,"Just, following up on the last point, the fossil fuel study is being conducted, that will be coming to my Committee next month, it was a little bit delayed because the whole point is to get an understanding of what jobs are related to the fossil fuel industry, and it was actually missing a component of the transportation sector, so, they have to go back and add an additional element to the work, that should be done next month.",60,,
308,0.97,4441.27,4446.508,"So, looking forward to hearing from them.",60,,
309,0.97,4446.508,4470.933,"Than I just wanted to sort of echo the sentiment here, which is that I really, when we see that we have to, our current annual reduction rate needs to accelerate 17 times, that is a damning statement.",60,,
310,0.97,4470.933,4495.858,"So, we have some serious work to do to figure out what we are going to be able to do and as he said, at jurisdictional levels, I really am glad to see that this green new deal team is coming together and that we are going to be working cross jurisdictional lead to figure this out.",60,,
311,0.97,4495.858,4546.475,"There's a lot of work to do, at the same time, we need to make sure we are ringing in young people, bringing in labor, bringing in folks who can take advantage of new technologies and new kind of manufacturing and infrastructure development, and also, make sure the folks who are currently employed have access to new training and no understanding as well, the reality is, people are going to lose their jobs as we make this transition, and we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get them access to training and keep them in good paying jobs that can help them support their families, that they get benefits, having a good Union job.",60,,
312,0.97,4546.475,4553.715,"So, we have a lot of work to do, and I'm excited to see all the folks on board, eager to get started.",60,,
313,0.97,4553.715,4559.288,Thinking.,60,,
314,0.97,4559.288,4602.331,"I think, Yeah, I don't see anybody else looking to speak, so, how about, Michelle, I really appreciate, Yeah, follow up with my office on some of those things we discussed, I think the prospect of a genuine green new deal jobs program is going to be, I think, a really sort of important plan of winning people over into making this kind of change.",61,,
315,0.97,4602.331,4619.781,"So, I hope we can come back to those discussions in upcoming meetings, and I really appreciate everybody's presentation, and welcome, everybody who has just got into the office, really, this is going to be crucial, not just for our city, but for our planet.",61,,
316,0.97,4619.781,4620.082,Thinking.,61,,
317,0.97,4620.082,4622.084,Thank you so much and thank you for your leadership.,62,,
318,0.97,4622.084,4634.997,"I know we are probably short on time, is it time to move to next agenda item or should I walk through some of the ongoing work for some of the new partnership work we are doing?",62,,
319,0.97,4634.997,4651.48,"Yes, sorry, I Blindsided myself, yes, absolutely you should, and then after that, we will move on.",63,,
320,0.97,4651.48,4655.05,I will try to be quick and kind of talk through this at a high-level.,64,,
321,0.97,4655.05,4658.82,"I think, again, I think this is just really helpful to talk about what we are working on this year.",64,,
322,0.97,4658.82,4666.728,"I look at this as observing as good, solid infrastructure for what we have done and where are the areas we can do more collectively as a community.",64,,
323,0.97,4666.728,4706.535,"I'm going to focus on the climate actions and buildings and transportation, we saw that is where the majority of our carbon pollution is coming from, we can go to the next slide, which will focus on buildings, so, I just want to note, we have had a building Tuneup program in place since 2019, that is a law that requires a large commercial and multifamily buildings to do operational and low-cost fixes to reduce emissions in their building, I want to say, we are really proud we just hit the 500 mark of the program, so, we are in the third Cohort of four that are doing these Tuneups.",64,,
324,0.97,4706.535,4713.475,"The other thing we are really proud of, 98% of the buildings, over 100,000 square feet, are Compliant with this law.",64,,
325,0.97,4713.475,4730.325,"I find that just outstanding considering the year we have all had, the team has done a lot to provide specialized engagement and assistance with these businesses, and to connect them with resources to help them comply with this law early.",64,,
326,0.97,4730.325,4776.838,"And wanted to note, relating jobs, our team has been focused on a several year partnership with South Seattle college, they have a sustainable building science technology program, over the last three years, we have been engaging with students who are being certified to that program as a bachelor of supply defines they get, so, we have worked with over 60 students in the last few years, a majority of those folks have been either people of color or women, so that has been really exciting, and we are connecting those folks to Real-World experience working on doing assessments with under Resourced businesses.",64,,
327,0.97,4776.838,4803.231,"I want to just hit on our leadership in our own building, so we continue to lead the way with reducing emissions in city there is a few exciting projects that we have engaged in, including putting solar on the break in Magnuson Park, and some really strategic and targeted investments in city buildings that are least Community-Based organizations providing critical community services such as food banks or senior services or meal programs.",64,,
328,0.97,4803.231,4812.374,"We have been making investments in those buildings that are eventually being transferred over to these community folks, and they're going to be left with buildings that that have lower energy costs and more efficient equipment to serve the community needs.",64,,
329,0.97,4812.374,4815.911,"Then, there is a focus, and we have been talking but Electrification, the path is Electrification.",64,,
330,0.97,4815.911,4822.484,"We have 20 projects underway, Electrification projects underway, in 20 of our buildings.",64,,
331,0.97,4822.484,4833.562,"Per the Mayor's 2020 green new deal executive order, on the city buildings are required to operate without fossil fuels.",64,,
332,0.97,4833.562,4848.844,"Looking out not just the city buildings, but the rest of the buildings in our community, and the plan to Electrify those I want to note, in 2019, the state passed a clean buildings law, which is that some energy targets for existing buildings to reduce carbon emissions and energy use from those buildings.",64,,
333,0.97,4848.844,4854.416,Compliance for the largest starts in 2026.,64,,
334,0.97,4854.416,4879.608,"There are incentives available right now to help businesses comply early, so, the work of our team is here is purring Seattle city light and partners to really look at how can we can support the business community here, comply with this law early, we are Prioritizing Nonprofits, and we are also Prioritizing building owners that are serving black, indigenous, and people of color communities.",64,,
335,0.97,4879.608,4893.221,"Wanted to note, the state standards are not enough to get Seattle where it needs to be to make our buildings carbon neutral, so, we have completed some Luminary technical work on what a more aggressive Bolded performance standard might look like.",64,,
336,0.97,4893.221,4897.459,We will be happy to share that work later as it is ready.,64,,
337,0.97,4897.459,4932.794,"We are in the process right now of working with partners like the Northwest energy coalition, as I mentioned before, to really engage Stakeholders around the technical, financial operational, equity, and other challenges, and sort of doing this next step of compliance, which will cost money, it will create some burden, and we want to make sure we do it right so, we are working with those folks to really understand those challenges and build a policy Úthat is successful, as well as looking at those workforce opportunities.",64,,
338,0.97,4932.794,4942.57,"In terms of residential buildings, homes in particular, we have been working to phase out dirty oil heat, since 2017, we have helped about 700 households converted from heating oil to efficient heat pumps.",64,,
339,0.97,4942.57,4953.915,"As you know, in 2019, the Mayor put forward a heating oil tax to help expand the rebates and also pay 100% of the conversions and households with lower incomes.",64,,
340,0.97,4953.915,4972.634,"We have put this implementation of this tax due to Covid-19, I know we will be coming back to you in June with kind of a game plan for what it looks like moving forward, given what is going on in our community.",64,,
341,0.97,4972.634,4978.74,"In the meantime, we will continue with the rebate program, and we have some partnerships to do conversions on 15 low income homes.",64,,
342,0.97,4978.74,4989.05,"Then the new commercial code, I don't need to get into that at this point, but it will eliminate gas for commercial and multifamily buildings.",64,,
343,0.97,4989.05,4994.356,Just wanted to call out a specific thank you to counsel on your partnership to work with the Mayor on passing this groundbreaking legislation.,64,,
344,0.97,4994.356,5013.441,"Last month, it was just really exciting for me, I was less involved, but kind of watching from the sides to see just a strong coalition of labor, if every environment and affordable housing providers speaking out in support of this legislation.",64,,
345,0.97,5013.441,5028.89,"We are shifting to transportation work, so, our core strategies in addressing transportation emissions, reducing Trivalent trips, increasing sustainable modes, and electrifying all vehicles that remain, as quickly as we can.",64,,
346,0.97,5028.89,5054.282,"We are Seattle Department of transportation, we are doing a lot of the mood and drive alone work, the office of Sustainability and environment has been continuing to explore Weld pricing as a possible tool for helping us achieve our goals, and just want to say, our community engagement efforts on that were paused last year, out of respect for Covid-19, and things folks are going too.",64,,
