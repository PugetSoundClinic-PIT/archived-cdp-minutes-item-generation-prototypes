22,0.97,79.145,87.12,"As you recall, we had an opportunity to have an overview of the proposed budget and were able to clarify some important questions and address some misconceptions.",14,,
23,0.97,87.12,105.905,"We were able to answer things and see the priorities reflected in our proposed budget and this is an opportunity for us as Council members to continue to go over the proposed budget and ask specific, clarifying questions before the deadline for amendments, which has been extended to 2:00 today.",14,,
24,0.97,105.905,118.451,"As a reminder, Council members wishing to sit--directions were sent to all of the Council members on Wednesday morning.",14,,
25,0.97,118.451,130.597,"Any proposal that increases the appropriations must be self balanced at this phase, meaning it must have funding that is identified through reducing another appropriation in the proposed budget or by suggesting increased revenue in some form.",14,,
26,0.97,130.597,145.445,"Notice that--if it requires legislation, the legislation also needs to be introduced and referred to the budget committee by November 15th.",14,,
27,0.97,145.445,149.315,The committee will vote on the balancing package and amendments on November 18th and the 19th if needed.,14,,
28,0.97,149.315,176.609,"Additional amendments that meet the agenda Timeline--excuse me, only amendments that need to meet established deadlines will be published on the appropriate meeting agenda, meaning if there is an item related to the agenda for Thursday, those materials need to be on the published agenda by Wednesday.",14,,
29,0.97,176.609,179.479,We have a Timeline for all of that.,14,,
30,0.97,179.479,181.147,That way can happen in a timely order.,14,,
31,0.97,181.147,184.817,"If there is an amendment we will discuss on Friday, we needed before the day before as well.",14,,
32,0.97,184.817,200.633,Amendment is not included in the final agenda will not be presented in the budget committee unless they are committed to all central staff directors and deputy clerks by 5:00 the night before.,14,,
33,0.97,200.633,207.607,"If they want to move an amendment and it is not on the agenda on the 18th and 19, the agenda must be amended by an affirmative vote by the majority of those present.",14,,
34,0.97,207.607,220.92,The final vote on the committee consideration for the proposed counsel . excuse me.,14,,
35,0.97,220.92,232.432,"The final vote on this budget will be conducted the morning of November 22nd . The budget committee will meet in the morning, November 22nd to make final votes on the Budget- related legislation.",14,,
36,0.97,232.432,243.743,And then the budget will be transmitted to full counsel that afternoon.,14,,
37,0.97,243.743,251.818,"I want to pause there to see if there are any questions about amendments, Timelines, or process over the next week before I moved into an overview to today's agenda for adoption and consideration.",14,,
38,0.97,251.818,254.887,Any questions about the Timeline in front of us?,14,,
39,0.97,254.887,260.293,"Okay, wonderful.",14,,
40,0.97,260.293,260.893,I will go ahead.,14,,
41,0.97,260.893,288.087,"We do have a packed agenda and will have a few hours to talk through the tremendous amount of work that central staff has done and all the work you have done as Council members to identify budget priorities and to make sure Seattle families and smallest businesses, those affected by Covid and the economic conditions that Covid has worsened, are addressed in a large part in this budget.",14,,
42,0.97,288.087,321.554,"There was a lot of alignment from Council members and along the lines in increasing funding for affordable housing and homeless services and making sure we have communities that are healthy and safe and that we have access to food for our most vulnerable, making sure we have a crew ceases for every budget by scouring the budget to see if there were any dollars that will be sitting in a Coffer and not used for the purposes of 2022's recovery and resiliency.",14,,
43,0.97,321.554,336.969,I want to thank all of you for the work you have done to make sure we have amendments in this proposed budget to truly address care and create economic resilience and invest in more equitable and safe community.,14,,
44,0.97,336.969,338.971,Today's agenda is the same one as on Wednesday.,14,,
45,0.97,338.971,342.508,I want to highlight we will be focused on four sections of the agenda.,14,,
46,0.97,342.508,350.75,We will open up by allowing for some staff to have an overview of the resources made available in this budget.,14,,
47,0.97,350.75,363.996,It is not as simple as saying there is a $50 million shortfall announced two Wednesdays and we have reductions.,14,,
48,0.97,363.996,366.165,It is not as simple as saying $10 million came from SPD.,14,,
49,0.97,366.165,367.2,That is not the case.,14,,
50,0.97,367.2,380.246,"Central South will walk through again where the resources came from, that were freed up in this--it is around $70 million that we were able to Reallocate to counsel priorities while also addressing a $50 million shortfall.",14,,
51,0.97,380.246,403.936,"This is an important reminder for members of the public as well, that we had an extensive amount of work done by central staff to look at every section of the budget and every Department, so we could free up resources to invest in counsel priorities, which are your priorities and the communities priorities.",14,,
52,0.97,403.936,421.42,We want to make sure that we go into the detailed explanation of those resources this morning so folks have a better understanding about how those things were made and how we took into consideration Councilmember requests . We will also focus on the verification on the SPD investments.,14,,
53,0.97,421.42,459.392,We want to talk about what is included in this budget and how there was an increase in investments of nearly $7 million while we also adjusted for areas that we are suggesting in this proposed budget are going to lead to either dollars sitting on the shelf and not being used due to higher than calculated salary savings in the proposed budget and also some technology investments and expansion in existing programs that came in the light of the needs we were trying to make and other areas of the budget invested in.,14,,
54,0.97,459.392,460.56,We will focus on SPD second.,14,,
55,0.97,460.56,466.132,"The third thing we will do is--excuse me, we will talk about investments in housing and end with homelessness.",14,,
56,0.97,466.132,477.91,"Those two areas, homelessness and housing, we do spend a lot of time on them, talking about the importance and we tied into those investments in behavioral health.",14,,
57,0.97,477.91,493.125,It is important to remember the investments we are putting forward really do help those who are Unhoused and those that are housed.,14,,
58,0.97,493.125,494.66,So those are the four categories.,14,,
59,0.97,494.66,502.201,"Resources, public safety, housing and homelessness, and behavioral health.",14,,
60,0.97,502.201,503.336,Go ahead and ask questions.,14,,
61,0.97,503.336,504.036,I am sorry.,15,,
62,0.97,504.036,505.037,I'm not asking a question.,15,,
63,0.97,505.037,508.741,I am underscoring something you said.,15,,
64,0.97,508.741,516.515,"I am very frustrated at seeing all the headlines, saying your proposed budget proposes a $10 million cut in SPD's budget.",15,,
65,0.97,516.515,517.817,That is not the case.,15,,
66,0.97,517.817,525.992,Your proposed budget proposes a $7 million increase over the 2021 SPD budget.,15,,
67,0.97,525.992,532.398,I am just wanting to underscore that in case folks listening may have missed it.,15,,
68,0.97,532.398,533.266,Thank you.,15,,
69,0.97,533.266,548.147,Thank you to you for recognizing that and they do have a chart that we have shared with many of you and will share it on the screen and make it available to the public.,16,,
70,0.97,548.147,568.701,"Absolutely, it is an important reminder that as we look for Savings within every Department, there are some savings within SPD but there was an request of over $70 million in SPD.",16,,
71,0.97,568.701,570.57,We will talk about this in just a moment.,16,,
72,0.97,570.57,574.373,This still allows for nearly $7 million of those increases while we also accomplished salary savings.,16,,
73,0.97,574.373,583.015,That is the distinction.,16,,
74,0.97,583.015,588.154,The $70 million increase was suggested and we got a $7 million increase in the proposed budget while also capturing cost savings and better aspects.,16,,
75,0.97,588.154,590.623,There is still that increased investment we would like to highlight.,16,,
76,0.97,590.623,591.49,"Thank you very much, Councilmember.",16,,
77,0.97,591.49,618.818,"If there are no objections, we will then make sure that any other areas of the budget you would like to highlight, there are so many great things from parks to city cleanup, to making sure that our cities are connected . We wanted connected with transportation investments, using all forms of options.",16,,
78,0.97,618.818,623.723,"If you have any clarifying questions that you would like to ask the central staff, that is what this agenda is for today.",16,,
79,0.97,623.723,627.76,"Again, our agenda includes the same agenda from Wednesday to focus on resources and public safety and housing, all that.",16,,
80,0.97,627.76,634.533,"Then we want to open it up to any other areas that folks would like to lift up, pieces they had invested in or ask specific clarifying questions.",16,,
81,0.97,634.533,649.148,"They are critical, so that you have an unformed understanding of any issues before you ask for an amendment from central staff.",16,,
82,0.97,652.218,654.787,This is our opportunity to get into those questions.,16,,
83,0.97,654.787,658.457,This is not a chance to talk about the specifics in an amendment you might be considering.,16,,
84,0.97,658.457,660.893,We will have today's focus on that next Thursday and Friday.,16,,
85,0.97,660.893,661.894,Any questions?,16,,
86,0.97,661.894,664.797,If there are no questions and no objections come today's agenda will be adopted.,16,,
87,0.97,664.797,667.9,No objections and it is adopted.,16,,
88,0.97,667.9,684.917,"At this time, we will open it up for public comment as folks know we have try to have it at the beginning of every meeting.",16,,

94,0.97,710.242,711.944,"Again, thanks to everyone that has provided public comment.",16,,

102,0.97,752.485,782.581,"Last week, they published more information on the ongoing scandals with the police accountability system involving the failure to properly investigate police abuse and the failure of the group to perform the function of reviewing investigations through--the report also highlights the director and his background as a defender of police abuse and as a sitting lawyer, before becoming director, who violated legal ethics in his effort to protect the lease.",17,,
103,0.97,782.581,792.024,"Four days ago, they published further revelations about these failures of police oversight and accountability.",17,,
104,0.97,792.024,799.165,These Whistleblower complaints and allegations of corruption remain Uncommented on and Uninvestigated.,17,,
105,0.97,799.165,802.601,They have refused to cut or Reapportion the millions spent for this failed accountability system.,17,,
106,0.97,802.601,812.711,"Please, consider Re- Apportioning this money and cutting funds from --",17,,

112,0.97,819.451,855.12,It should be rejected out of principal because the city council is immorally and I Daresay illegally stealing Federal Covid relief money meant to solve the homeless crisis with no--while Co- opting the Federal money as Jumpstart taxes with an unconstitutional spending plan that gives a middle-class payment monthly to noncitizens and Foreign-Born.,21,,
113,0.97,855.12,856.689,They get no shelter for homeless citizens.,21,,
114,0.97,856.689,862.861,They still have $70 million to purchase out protesters and politically connected Nonprofits to help Reelect counsel overseeing their budget.,21,,
115,0.97,862.861,867.366,It is obviously you are ignoring that and can tuning your abuse of the budget to secure a reelection apparatus.,21,,

151,0.97,1065.597,1092.09,"It only came back because counsel forced SPD to do it and even then, the director--they designed the program by not letting them see an alternative response to calls and they commented they will not replace officer contact with the community and the indicated--it is needed for something else . for those reasons, encourage the Council to transfer CSO's here as soon as possible.",27,,

156,0.97,1137.87,1161.393,They have hiring bonuses but it would not necessarily support the increase and they looked at the retention study in 2019 and they indicate officers were leaving SPD due to the salary or income was a barrier to recruitment . So I just wanted to call on this.,29,,

173,0.97,1272.804,1278.91,"We are asking for an increase to the proposal for $1.7 Million- $13 million for the full $240 million it takes to convert 14,000 oil homes to clean, electric energy.",33,,
174,0.97,1278.91,1287.986,Most of the homes are in South and West Seattle.,33,,
175,0.97,1287.986,1290.422,You have worked hard on that deal.,33,,
176,0.97,1290.422,1308.64,Make this the first demonstration project that will generate apprenticeship and trade jobs far more than any other sector on the horizon.,33,,
177,0.97,1308.64,1314.479,We can generate sales tax from the materials purchase and lift the burdens off the backs of people of color and help our economic recovery and resiliency.,33,,

183,0.97,1325.057,1335.967,"Yes, I would like to ask all city council members to support Sdot to submit a report on bridge damage by overweight vehicles.",35,,
184,0.97,1335.967,1367.399,It is a very important internal report which has not yet been presented to the city Council and they find much of the growing backlog from damaged roads and bridges has been potentially Avoidable if steps were taken to discourage extra heavy or overweight vehicles.,35,,
185,0.97,1367.399,1370.902,Doing so would free up funds for more creative transportation projects and also many other social needs.,35,,
186,0.97,1370.902,1375.207,"This is a very important, urgent budget issue to ask Sdot to do the study.",35,,

196,0.97,1420.152,1421.119,We're not quite there yet.,37,,
197,0.97,1421.119,1439.271,"Even with green new deal investments from Jumpstart, we are on track to pass a budget--this undermines the city's green new deal . We need to work on it now.",37,,
198,0.97,1439.271,1440.672,There is still room to act.,37,,
199,0.97,1440.672,1443.375,"In the proposed budget, there is $40 million for one-time budget changes for SPD.",37,,
200,0.97,1443.375,1444.643,It is undefined and unaccountable.,37,,

217,0.97,1516.815,1526.558,"I want to take one step before we begin and everybody could give a big, huge round of applause to central staff.",40,,
218,0.97,1526.558,1530.962,That would be wonderful.,40,,
219,0.97,1530.962,1532.397,"Thank you very much, central staff.",40,,
220,0.97,1532.397,1556.187,"Director, thank you to all of your team and thank you--we have the Around-The-Clock work you have been doing we will continue to discuss it over the next week.",40,,
221,0.97,1556.187,1561.393,"By this time, we will be midway through our final day to consider budget amendments and then the following Monday, we will vote it through.",40,,
222,0.97,1561.393,1564.663,I want you to note the impressive work that has been done in a short Timeframe.,40,,
223,0.97,1564.663,1568.767,We have done it at the state Legislature through each body with the house and the Senate.,40,,
224,0.97,1568.767,1583.214,"It has given him about 3 to 4 months, given on the year, to go through that.",40,,
225,0.97,1583.214,1586.785,"As a legislator does, they take the suggestions from executive and they Re-Create the budgets themselves.",40,,
226,0.97,1586.785,1620.752,"You are re-creating the budget document in a matter of eight weeks with a lot less resources compared to relative to the state legislative partners cities are truly at a place where community goes first to get their needs met, whether it is housing or food services or whether that means Scaling investments into community safety as we also try to respond to the ongoing call for Redoing how we engage with community and actually investing in it.",40,,
227,0.97,1620.752,1623.388,I want to say thank you to central staff before we get started.,40,,
228,0.97,1623.388,1625.156,Did you have a similar comment along those lines?,40,,
229,0.97,1625.156,1631.529,I want to at your thanks to staff and members of the public who have been here.,41,,
230,0.97,1631.529,1645.377,"I want to thank you, Madam chair, for your foresight and leave being the Council to look at the tax.",41,,
231,0.97,1645.377,1689.788,"We have talked a lot about how the table tax has made it possible for us to not--over the last year but one point that maybe is implicit in the recognition of how the payroll tax has helped us, we have not, I think, explicitly talked about the fact that the defense of the Jumpstart payroll tax is so important to us . As Teresa Mosqueda has noted, it is predicated on the payroll tax.",41,,
232,0.97,1689.788,1714.712,They have support from the city to prevent--we all know that they have filed a legal challenge and the city attorney has successfully defended the city in King County Superior Court.,41,,
233,0.97,1714.712,1717.148,They have now appealed the ruling to Washington state court of Appeals.,41,,
234,0.97,1717.148,1728.86,"In the cities dissents, if it is not successful, the Mayor will be faced with a proposed budget--with proposed budget cuts that could be up to $200 million or more and make it very difficult to avoid Across- The-Board cuts.",41,,
235,0.97,1728.86,1748.379,"I really hate to see the incoming administration be placed in that position and I do not believe it would be good for anyone at all . This last year, when they had to respond to the calls, after the start of the Covid pandemic, they ordered cuts to the Seattle police Department budget and a hiring freeze.",41,,
236,0.97,1748.379,1756.488,That was for new officers.,41,,
237,0.97,1756.488,1758.89,There was the appeal case that is due on the 15th.,41,,
238,0.97,1758.89,1772.47,Those will be developed under our current city attorney and oral arguments will be scheduled once a written--that means oral arguments will be made under the next city attorney.,41,,
239,0.97,1772.47,1776.508,The city attorney's office says this will likely be sometime in the first half of the year.,41,,
240,0.97,1776.508,1794.592,Just underscoring how important defending the Jumpstart payroll tax will be in preserving this budget in 2022 and beyond.,41,,
241,0.97,1794.592,1794.893,Thank you.,41,,
242,0.97,1794.893,1796.427,"Thank you very much, vice chair.",42,,
243,0.97,1796.427,1799.497,You said it better than I ever could and I appreciate you underscoring that point.,42,,
244,0.97,1799.497,1830.929,Then the entire community continues to see how this budget really was made possible because of the foresight that the Council had with Overwriting the Mayor's veto on our early conversations around Jumpstart and investments that were made possible with the Jumpstart funded Covid relief the package that the city passed in anticipation in the need and before any of the Federal resources came down.,42,,
245,0.97,1830.929,1832.063,Thank you for providing that.,42,,
246,0.97,1832.063,1842.273,It does help to correct the record when you see things like the columnist from the Seattle times fail to acknowledge the importance of Jumpstart and the sheer need for us all to rebuild and build in a more accurate will wake him including for small businesses.,42,,
247,0.97,1842.273,1855.887,"It requires us to build upon the things to make it possible and year after year, we will see stability as we are providing it here with this year's budget.",42,,
248,0.97,1855.887,1864.295,"When the revenue forecast gets better, we will see the percentage dollar amounts--what we have allocated higher to more dollar amounts.",42,,
249,0.97,1864.295,1865.997,Thank you to your work on this plan.,42,,
250,0.97,1865.997,1905.003,"Also, we are planning for the need for us to address any volatility in the upcoming year or years and we are continuing to invest in our revenue options--a few sunny, in our resource options by maintaining a healthy amount of investments into the emergency funds and that is critical as we think about the importance of keeping families Fed and housed with the possibility of having additional assistance.",42,,
251,0.97,1905.003,1911.876,"Because I could not do it better than the vice chair tested, I will walk us through where we are at in the process and also we will get into the resource conversation.",42,,
252,0.97,1911.876,1935.266,It is important because there has been an attempt to deduce the changes we have made to simply say that $10 million of the $50 million--it just came from SPD and we did a lot of work to scour every section of the budget to fund counsel priorities to the tune of over $70 million.,42,,
253,0.97,1935.266,1943.207,We want to make sure folks have a better understanding of the ways in which central staff at the Council members have been working together to identify resources across the board and to invest in those highest needs.,42,,
254,0.97,1943.207,1944.175,Thank you to the director.,42,,
255,0.97,1944.175,1947.145,We are happy to have you back with us.,42,,
256,0.97,1947.145,1960.491,"Thank you, Madam chair and good morning to the director of counsel central staff.",43,,
257,0.97,1960.491,1963.494,I will start with just the briefest reminder of where we are in the Timeline.,43,,
258,0.97,1963.494,1965.563,"We are on step four, discussion of the balancing package.",43,,
259,0.97,1965.563,1976.207,This morning's conversation will be a continuation of the briefing that we offered to the Council on Wednesday morning about the items in the chair's package.,43,,
260,0.97,1976.207,1978.91,These are the topics you heard about in your public hearing Wednesday evening.,43,,
261,0.97,1978.91,1986.217,We will finish discussion on it today and then be in Committee next week to talk about amendments to this package.,43,,
262,0.97,1986.217,1999.03,"If you could jump to slide six, I will briefly Recap a couple of inner issue discussions back in stage II and three.",43,,
263,0.97,1999.03,2040.705,We discussed items that they talked about with the importance of Jumpstart in the Mayor balancing her budget and two of the key issues were identified early on is that $148 million of Jumpstart was used to support the general Fund and that was $62 million more than allowed per current Jumpstart policies and reduced the capacity to fund programs in 2023 and beyond.,43,,
264,0.97,2041.205,2045.576,Another issue identified was that there were $70 million of ongoing funding for equitable communities initiatives and Participatory budgeting and community safety.,43,,
265,0.97,2045.576,2051.082,This is priorities that were shared but they do not have an ongoing funding source to support them.,43,,
266,0.97,2051.082,2054.652,Next slide.,43,,
267,0.97,2054.652,2076.507,"These issues were sort of compounded by the revenue forecast you received on November 3RD . that showed a $50 million forecasted decrease for the general fund across 2021 and 2022, artfully driven by accommodation of delayed return to work and accommodation of payroll tax and sales tax and parking plans.",43,,
268,0.97,2076.507,2092.523,"$19 million is projected to be decreased across other funds and an increase of the real estate excise tax, which can be used for capital projects.",43,,
269,0.97,2092.523,2096.394,We will then Recap the resources that we are identifying.,43,,
270,0.97,2096.394,2097.395,"Patty, next slide.",43,,
271,0.97,2097.395,2117.181,"Across these two tables, which we will look through on the next two slides, the Council identified a total of $70 million of spending in the 2022 proposed budget that could be paused or cut to be deployed for other priorities.",43,,
272,0.97,2117.181,2135.132,"I will not go through quite the same level of detail as I did on Wednesday but I will remind you what are in each of these buckets and then I will hand it over to my colleague, Greg Doss, to offer a more detailed explanation of the changes here.",43,,
273,0.97,2135.132,2149.747,The police Department--I will do a high level on these chair let me know if you have other questions as I go.,43,,
274,0.97,2149.747,2175.406,"I just wanted to note for the process, for the purpose says of the agenda, we will go through this revenue conversation and we want to address themes or questions that may come up and offer additional clarity on SPD specifically and then we will go to central staff to talk through investments in housing and homelessness.",44,,
275,0.97,2175.406,2180.044,Those are the three policy areas and then we are going to address any additional questions in other areas of the budget.,44,,
276,0.97,2180.044,2180.444,Is that correct?,44,,
277,0.97,2180.444,2181.279,That is correct.,45,,
278,0.97,2181.279,2184.715,I also want to thank Gonzales who joined us during public comment.,45,,
279,0.97,2184.715,2185.917,Thank you for being with us.,45,,
280,0.97,2185.917,2191.489,I failed to acknowledge you after a public comment but thank you for joining us.,45,,
281,0.97,2191.489,2191.756,Great.,46,,
282,0.97,2191.756,2208.105,"On this resource list, the first place the chair and the Council looked for resources were items in the 2021 budget that were not going to be set in 2021.",46,,
283,0.97,2208.105,2216.113,"This is a $.6 million of funding that comes from the human services Department, fire Department, and finance general.",46,,
284,0.97,2216.113,2222.72,This is a redeployed community safety capacity for safety priorities in 2022.,46,,
285,0.97,2222.72,2256.153,"This is Aligning the triage 1 emergency response program start date to the end of 2022, capturing money that was in the 2020/2021 budget . They could capture some balance of Covid vaccine reserves that have not been spent and redeployed some rapid Rehousing money for better leveraged products in 2022.",46,,
286,0.97,2256.153,2268.165,"Next is the chair's omnibus, which will restore Jumpstart funding policy to current policy.",46,,
287,0.97,2268.165,2275.806,This allowed $85 million of Jumpstart funds to support the general fund broadly and preserve existing programs while tax revenues were covered and wanted to $49 million in the defined Jumpstart policies.,46,,
288,0.97,2275.806,2289.92,This recognizes that the city has capacity to use $30 million for the equitable community initiative and Participatory budgeting.,46,,
289,0.97,2289.92,2290.821,It is not $60 million.,46,,
290,0.97,2290.821,2300.231,"Overall, this action enables $41 million to be spent in 2022 on projects that are ready to go.",46,,
291,0.97,2300.231,2318.315,This action is the largest resource on this list and the most significant change in his budget at 41 1/2 million dollars.,46,,
292,0.97,2318.315,2318.649,Great.,46,,
293,0.97,2318.649,2319.25,I will keep going.,46,,
294,0.97,2319.25,2339.37,The next was identifying a new revenue source to fully fund the Seattle promise program and the Mayor's proposed level using $4 million of under spend in the levee.,46,,
295,0.97,2339.37,2340.671,We scrubbed the budgets in the I.T.,46,,
296,0.97,2340.671,2344.642,Department and there is a $1.4 million of Federal funding that is being used for projects in the I.T.,46,,
297,0.97,2344.642,2354.885,Department and projects were extended for 2022 and this continues to provide seven months of funding for those projects but not the full $12 million.,46,,
298,0.97,2354.885,2360.658,"Also, the I.T.",46,,
299,0.97,2360.658,2362.259,Department here assumes a higher vacancy rate.,46,,
300,0.97,2362.259,2379.51,"This was a look across all aspects of the budget to find a set of resources and, finally, the last one on this list is reducing the transfer to the revenue stabilization fund by $1.5 million.",46,,
301,0.97,2379.51,2382.179,Any questions on these items before I go to the next slide?,46,,
302,0.97,2382.179,2389.62,Let's go to the next slide.,46,,
303,0.97,2389.62,2389.854,Great.,46,,
304,0.97,2389.854,2405.035,"At the top of this list is, again, a look at the fire Department budget, an action in 2022 to align the Standup of the triage 1 program with the current Timeline, as discussed on Wednesday.",46,,
305,0.97,2405.035,2428.425,"This leaves $1.1 million in the 2022 budget for triage one to hire staff and prepare vehicles for that deployment but SETS aside the money that we would not get otherwise deployed . In just a moment, we will turn it over to Greg Doss to talk about the SPD budget.",46,,
306,0.97,2428.425,2432.029,"Before that, I will touch on the two new revenue sources that are also on the table.",46,,
307,0.97,2432.029,2448.646,$26.2 million of--it will pay for debt service and to plot a whole that is caused by a downward forecast in the commercial parking tax and the bulk of it going to fund one- time capital projects in transportation and parks.,46,,
308,0.97,2448.646,2464.461,"Finally, recognizing $2.9 million of commercial parking tax revenue generated from Cpt rate increase of 2% in the proposed budget.",46,,
309,0.97,2464.461,2475.072,The last item that does not show up on this chart is using $3.1 million of this as initial debt service for $100 million issuance of bonds in 2022.,46,,
310,0.97,2475.072,2484.915,This package includes putting those pieces in motion and giving the opportunity for the executive to come back in early 2022 to let us know what scale of bonds they can issue.,46,,
311,0.97,2484.915,2492.523,Any questions about overall resources before hand it over to someone else?,46,,

313,0.97,2517.548,2544.174,"If they will be sitting there, not actively helping folks in the midst of a pandemic, we want to make sure that they were redeployed elsewhere that is not a comment about the program itself, recognizing there is over $1 million in the system to set off the protocol but if there were dollars that could be deployed in 2021 or 2022, we wanted to make sure we use those for the incredible need we see in the community right now.",47,,

319,0.97,2584.782,2597.027,It is called baseline adjustments for personnel costs and I believe overall the Department has increased about $4.8 million for executives and managers or something regarding compensation.,49,,

321,0.97,2608.639,2614.945,I can take that question.,50,,
322,0.97,2614.945,2650.18,"Council member Pedersen, there are a number of technical adjustments in the proposed budget as well as adjustments related to personnel cost and that can cover a wide range of adjustments in Department space budgets to accommodate and require through contractual obligations, annual wage increases, to account for increased costs for staffing due to Reclassifications and positions or promotions and that sort of thing, as long--along with costs.",50,,
323,0.97,2650.18,2672.603,The items you're referring to specifically in the proposed budget are related to some idols items that would provide an annual wage increase to employees of the city who did not--who are not represented in certain job classifications.,50,,
324,0.97,2672.603,2673.67,I do not have them all.,50,,
325,0.97,2673.67,2678.075,That did not receive the annual wage increase that most city employees received in 2020 or 2021.,50,,
326,0.97,2678.075,2694.792,"So it would give those positions the annual wage increase in 2022 and it is equivalent to the annual wage increase that most employees, most city employees received in 2020 one.",50,,

347,0.97,2828.559,2906.436,"So when we spoke last on Wednesday, we talked about the 10.9 million in reductions to go SPD and we used the term reduction because we were talking about these changes relative to the 2022 proposed budget but I would like to start my presentation today by taking a really big step back and to talk about the 2022 proposed budget and Revisit some comments I made way back when we were doing the issue paper presentation and at a very high level to recognize that what happened when the Mayor created the 2022 proposed budget is that she sent a budget that was appropriating somewhere around $19 million of salary funding for officers that would not be needed because there are not officers there to take the salaries.",56,,
348,0.97,2906.436,2922.552,That $19 million in salary funding that was--that is in the proposed budget for those officers is instead being redirected to other places.,56,,
349,0.97,2922.552,2961.792,"The city normally operates under a budget process known as incremental budgeting, whereby a large amount of salary funding like that, that is not needed for salary, no longer needed for the purpose that it is intended, might normally be reduced from the departments budget and taken back to the general Fund and then if there is something in the Department that is needed, that is new, those new things would be added as distinct items for the Council to take a look at, to examine, to make policy choices about.",56,,
350,0.97,2961.792,2967.264,Things like the items that are on this list.,56,,
351,0.97,2967.264,2979.242,That is not the way the Mayor wrote her 2022 proposed budget.,56,,
352,0.97,2982.079,2984.514,That is not the way it was presented to the Council.,56,,
353,0.97,2984.514,2990.687,"Instead, she retained the $19 million in salary savings in the Department come even though there were not officers to use it, and then redirected that salary savings towards these items.",56,,
354,0.97,2990.687,3003.6,"So when the Council received the budget, the Council made some decisions to reduce these items and it appears as though the Council is making a cut.",56,,
355,0.97,3003.6,3005.635,That is not necessarily a fair way to portray it.,56,,
356,0.97,3005.635,3031.128,"If indeed we were operating on incremental budgeting and if indeed the city budget had reduced to the unneeded salary savings from SPD's budget and proposed these items as true Standalone, distinct, new items for the Council to consider, then it would be the case where the Council was simply rejecting new items.",56,,
357,0.97,3031.128,3041.772,That is more true than the case that the Council is cutting the SPD based budget.,56,,
358,0.97,3041.772,3050.247,"I want to start by offering that as an overview and with that as an overview, this table will make a little more sense.",56,,
359,0.97,3050.247,3064.061,This table is reflecting the changes that the Council has made to the SPD budget and reflects the $10.9 million in Council budget actions that were taken.,56,,
360,0.97,3064.061,3074.104,"I will start by highlighting that the first item in the table, the first row is funding for sworn staff.",56,,
361,0.97,3074.104,3087.784,You will see the first column is labeled funding for sworn staff and the first column there says proposed increase 2021 adopted to 2022 proposed budget.,56,,
362,0.97,3087.784,3094.257,"Excuse me, I just want to make sure that colleagues have this document.",57,,
363,0.97,3094.257,3108.004,I Emailed it Thursday morning but we can Recirculate it if I saw some folks straining to see the screen.,57,,
364,0.97,3108.004,3110.707,Why don't we Recirculate that if it has not been circulated this morning.,57,,
365,0.97,3110.707,3121.985,I did see Council member Lewis--did you get a chance to have it?,57,,
366,0.97,3121.985,3123.353,I have not circulated this document.,58,,
367,0.97,3123.353,3127.757,"I will hit send on my end, so you have it and members of your team have it as well.",59,,
368,0.97,3127.757,3130.66,Did you want to wait until Greg gets a chance to walk through tis?,59,,
369,0.97,3130.66,3135.165,If I could finish--we can go back to Council member Lewis before a walk through each item?,60,,
370,0.97,3135.165,3137.134,"That is perfectly fine, Madam chair.",61,,
371,0.97,3137.134,3144.841,I would ask how you wanted to lineup the questions.,61,,
372,0.97,3144.841,3146.676,I will defer to however you want to do it.,61,,
373,0.97,3146.676,3167.297,"We will have you restart your presentation on this first item and we can, I think, take questions line by line, Greg, if that makes sense to you.",62,,
374,0.97,3167.297,3174.104,"Colleagues, let's allow for him to start the presentation on line 1 and then we will pause before going through each of the lines and I will hit set on the document.",62,,
375,0.97,3174.104,3178.008,This will be posted to the agenda as well.,62,,
376,0.97,3178.008,3179.276,"Thank you, Madam chair.",63,,
377,0.97,3179.276,3183.146,"Again, I am going to finish an orientation before I go in line by line and start taking questions.",63,,
378,0.97,3183.146,3223.853,"Item number one, funding for sworn staff and the first column, the proposed increase from the 2021 adopted to the 2022 proposed budget, you will see there are 14 annual average FTE or two point Oh million dollars . What you see here is the Mayor's office transmitted a proposed budget that added $2 million in sworn funding to a budget that was already in excess for approximately $70 million overfunded for sworn salaries.",63,,
379,0.97,3223.853,3230.46,I will repeat that.,63,,
380,0.97,3230.46,3241.371,The SPD budget was already $17 million overfunded for sworn salaries and the Mayor's office budget added $2 million more for sworn salaries.,63,,
381,0.97,3241.371,3249.079,Then they took the entire $19 million and we distributed it according to the Mayor's son and priorities.,63,,
382,0.97,3249.079,3262.592,"To be clear, the proposed or that chair's proposed changes are not actually cutting, cutting the base budget.",63,,
383,0.97,3262.592,3273.403,The chair is merely making changes to the salary savings that the Mayor had already redistributed according to her own priorities.,63,,
384,0.97,3273.403,3306.603,"The actual budget itself, if you look at the total appropriation, it only changes by about little over $2 million in changes from $363 million to about $365 million and as you can see in this table, there is $2 million that was added for sworn salary Savings and that was on top of $17 million of sworn salary savings that was already present in the budget.",63,,
385,0.97,3306.603,3311.708,"So with that, as an overview, I will take questions before we restart going into it.",63,,
386,0.97,3311.708,3314.644,Wonderful.,64,,
387,0.97,3314.644,3320.85,"Go ahead, M. Lorena Gonzalez.",64,,
388,0.97,3320.85,3333.53,"Thank you, Greg, I will do--maybe you can help me do a little bit of round setting, so we are talking--we are speaking the same language as we continue to have this conversation.",65,,
389,0.97,3333.53,3353.049,"So how many physicians, how many vacant--first of all, my understanding is what you are describing around the excess funding of sworn staff SPD is what we are really talking about here.",65,,
390,0.97,3353.049,3374.604,"I want to get a sense of how many vacant, how many vacant positions were proposed to be funded in the Mayor's proposed 2022 budget?",65,,
391,0.97,3374.604,3382.112,How many vacant positions?,66,,
392,0.97,3382.112,3406.002,"I would say from a budget perspective, we talked about full-time equivalent FTE and there were 134 FTE annual average FTE that were not necessary, that were funded in the Mayor's proposed budget.",66,,
393,0.97,3406.002,3412.742,That is a little bit different than the number of specific police officers and the pockets of poor student officers.,66,,
394,0.97,3412.742,3423.62,The FTE number is the number that we track for budget purposes and the number is $134 million that was funded--not necessary.,66,,
395,0.97,3423.62,3439.502,"When you say that those 134 sworn staff, full-time equivalent positions, were funded in a proposed budget but not necessary, what does that mean?",67,,
396,0.97,3439.502,3488.985,"That means that the staffing plan as transmitted by the Department that would have included 125 new hires and would have forecasted or projected 94 separations and could have been completed and fully supported and the Department could have paid for all of it, all the officers and its student officers and its recruits and after all of that, they still had funding to support 134 positions too much.",68,,
397,0.97,3488.985,3510.94,"In other words, the 134 vacant but funded positions are in excess of the Seattle police Department's proposed hiring plan, which is funded by both the Mayor's proposed budget and the chair's Rebalanced budget?",69,,
398,0.97,3510.94,3512.542,That is correct.,70,,
399,0.97,3512.542,3515.211,134 FTE.,70,,
400,0.97,3515.211,3534.063,134 positions is what the Mayor proposed on top of an in excess of what the Seattle police Department indicated to the Council and to the Mayor that they would be able to hire?,71,,
401,0.97,3534.063,3535.765,That is correct.,72,,
402,0.97,3535.765,3558.588,"Can you just walk us through conceptually or Definitionally the concept of--when we talk about aggregation of positions, what is the affect of that?",73,,
403,0.97,3558.588,3565.762,"Well, that is a good question.",74,,
404,0.97,3565.762,3575.405,Aggregation of positions and money are not necessarily the same thing and the city's budget process.,74,,
405,0.97,3575.405,3605.902,"If the Council decided that it would like to aggregate positions, unneeded positions, from the police Department, then I think it would send a strong message to the future executive that the next proposed budget should not include salary savings for, well, for vacant positions because those positions would not be there.",74,,
406,0.97,3605.902,3608.705,I think that would be a strong message.,74,,
407,0.97,3608.705,3611.941,I really --,74,,
408,0.97,3611.941,3618.614,I think--just so I am clear.,75,,
409,0.97,3618.614,3634.864,My understanding is when you aggregate positions that basically means you are eliminating appropriation for vacant positions that we reasonably believe will not ever be fulfilled?,75,,
410,0.97,3634.864,3640.47,Or filled.,75,,
411,0.97,3640.47,3641.471,Maybe in the next fiscal year?,75,,
412,0.97,3641.471,3643.539,"I think you could say that, yes.",76,,
413,0.97,3643.539,3682.512,"And I--around aggregation in particular, are there any other, and central staff evaluation, this could be answered by either of you, are there any other departments, budgets as presented in the Mayor's proposed budget that fund vacant staff positions at the level we see in the Seattle police Department and their proposed budget?",77,,
414,0.97,3682.512,3683.146,Council President Gonzalez.,78,,
415,0.97,3683.146,3696.359,"I am not aware of--I would say--if I might just, for a minute, this is a very unusual proposed budget for a department.",78,,
416,0.97,3696.359,3714.911,"Typically, what I would expect to see with these sorts of changes of Reallocating funds is a proposed budget that included very clearly in the budget documents that there was a cut in funding for salaries, for sworn officers, and ads for each of these other items.",78,,
417,0.97,3714.911,3716.379,"Instead, it was a bit opaque.",78,,
418,0.97,3716.379,3730.56,"Greg has done a lot of work to Untangle sort of how this funding, how these items are paid for, using salary savings.",78,,
419,0.97,3730.56,3764.961,"One of the calendars I had I would note, for example, is using that salary savings just assumed this year, for something like an expansion of the community service officer's program would mean if they were able to fill all those sworn officer positions in 2023, you would need and take on a new fund source for that expansion of community safety officers and as we have been talking about throughout the budget process, the on gone--it is a challenge that the Council and the executive will be grappling with in the coming year.",78,,
420,0.97,3764.961,3785.314,"Put another way, sort of Reallocating the salary savings without showing that clarity or cutting the funding and/or the positions makes it difficult for the Council to understand how the base budget is growing or shrinking.",78,,
421,0.97,3785.314,3786.382,I appreciate that.,79,,
422,0.97,3786.382,3818.948,I think that is characterizing how to assemble a budget fairly and I am trying to move away from the technical aspects of how a budget is put together and really talk more about what is in the budget and the affect of what is being proposed to the Council and that is kind of where I want to focus.,79,,
423,0.97,3818.948,3844.473,"I understand we have concerns about how the budget is presented from a technical perspective but I want to stay focused on the effect of the Mayor's choice to do that . What is the effect of the Mayor's choice to send us an opaque budget, setting aside the question of whether we agree or disagree to the level of Opaqueness.",79,,
424,0.97,3844.473,3958.554,"If I can keep us at that level for a moment, I would find that extraordinarily helpful because I do think the effect of this and this is what I would like for others on central staff--my understanding is if the Council chooses to allow the Mayor and the future Mayor to continue with the practice of funding at an extraordinary level of 134 FTE's that are they get and they have told us they cannot hire them, then we are allowing for an artificial expansion of the police Department budget to the tune of $17.7 million . and I think if we do not--my sense is if those positions are not Aggregated, if those vacant positions cannot be filled according to the Seattle police Department and are not Aggregated, which is the technical term we are using under the budget process, then we will continue to see an executive budget that is shaped and formed around an artificial number, which results in reduced general fund for other city priorities and allows the Seattle police Department to effectively have a savings account of about $20 million every year unless the Council takes action on these vacant and unfunded and on Hirono positions for the command staff.",79,,
425,0.97,3958.554,3960.389,I think that is all true.,80,,
426,0.97,3960.389,3972.768,I think the one thing that you did not say inherent in your comments is that it reduces transparency for the Council.,80,,
427,0.97,3972.768,3982.611,You do not see necessarily the individual changes that are made . They are not highlighted in the budget in the same way.,80,,
428,0.97,3982.611,3991.287,"If something is being added, it is not called an add.",80,,
429,0.97,3991.287,4000.996,It is not presented to the council as a proposed ad.,80,,
430,0.97,4000.996,4003.899,It is not--it is not presented to the public as a proposed add.,80,,
431,0.97,4003.899,4008.838,It is not presented to the public as the Council rejecting or accepting a proposed add.,80,,
432,0.97,4008.838,4018.447,"It is the case that the counsel's budget winds up being a cut to the police Department, which is very different.",80,,
433,0.97,4018.447,4018.781,Yeah.,81,,
434,0.97,4018.781,4039.068,"I will take us back but just to your question about whether or not this is Commenting in other departments--I would say in general, departments frequently, throughout the course of the year, rely on vacancies savings for unexpected expenditures.",82,,
435,0.97,4039.068,4076.705,What is unusual in this case is the size and the assumption going into adopting a budget for the next year and--I think getting more transparency in SPD and all departments about assumed vacancies and what they are assuming about how to use those vacancies savings is something we will look forward to . This is unusual and I'm not aware of another Department that is taking this approach in the proposed budget.,82,,
436,0.97,4076.705,4077.506,Thank you.,83,,
437,0.97,4077.506,4078.574,I'm glad you brought that up.,83,,
438,0.97,4078.574,4091.887,Spd has always relied on salary savings for technical adjustments like if it is sworn separations or separation pay was funded out of salary savings.,83,,
439,0.97,4091.887,4099.528,If it is deferred--that was funded.,83,,
440,0.97,4099.528,4114.31,There is administrative costs that are funded out of salary savings but that is different than a new policy proposal such as a new technology investment or a bonus for police officers.,83,,
441,0.97,4114.31,4126.789,These are clearly things that are new proposals.,83,,
442,0.97,4127.189,4127.389,Yeah.,84,,
443,0.97,4127.389,4129.825,"I would say, you know, I agree with that analysis, Greg.",84,,
444,0.97,4129.825,4137.433,I think it is reasonable to say we need some salary savings.,84,,
445,0.97,4137.433,4153.883,"We need to--like other departments, we need to rely on a reasonable amount of salary savings to account for things like unexpected paid leave or other kind of salary savings adjacent but related things and I am not objecting to that.",84,,
446,0.97,4153.883,4198.427,I think that is reasonable to have some salary savings available for those kinds of discretionary uses that are designed to predict weight--I think my concern is the scale of salary savings that the police Department has been allowed to benefit from year after year after year after year is very much out of sync and out of step with other departments who are also providing critical public services and services to our constituents and the residents of the city.,84,,
447,0.97,4198.427,4226.488,I feel like there is an opportunity for us to perhaps not zero out this line item but have a more reasonable proposal around how much salary savings you will be allotted as the Seattle police Department to accommodate for reasonably related expenditures that could not have been anticipated in November of the previous year.,84,,
448,0.97,4226.488,4274.203,"You know, I will disclose that I am interested in working with Council central staff and the chair to explore that amusement and to Queue for conversation so we can have a transparent conversation about that policy choice that is fundamentally about increasing transparency in this budget and making sure we have accountability and that we are Aligning the Department--there budgets and practices more closely with what other departments throughout the city who do not enjoy this kind of discretionary budget every single year have.",84,,
449,0.97,4274.203,4275.237,"Thank you, Council President.",85,,
450,0.97,4275.237,4278.907,I would very much welcome that and welcomed that conversation.,85,,
451,0.97,4278.907,4296.425,"Greg and Allie, thank you for helping to flesh out some of the issues that the Council President is really Articulating here because if we do not see these types of changes in the executive former Ural proposal, they do not see it either.",85,,
452,0.97,4296.425,4323.218,"If the Mayor and the executive are not being transparent and how they are using what should be only allocated to unexpected changes and they tuck in using funds for expanded programs or completely new technology, the members of the community are equally left in the dark about how those dollars are being allocated.",85,,
453,0.97,4323.218,4338.067,We need to have a transparent process and need to be held accountable to understanding how each of these dollars fund the public and I would suggest what you just outlined today has now made the proposal transparent but it was not transparent when it was transmitted down.,85,,
454,0.97,4338.067,4338.967,Thank you for outlining that.,85,,
455,0.97,4338.967,4360.856,"We've offered clarity to what this conversation has been about where to use underutilized and usable dollars, dollars that cannot be used unfunded and--thank you for noting that, Council President.",85,,
456,0.97,4360.856,4362.124,"Councilmember, please go ahead.",86,,
457,0.97,4362.124,4363.192,"Thank you, Madam chair.",87,,
458,0.97,4363.192,4381.176,"I think my area of questioning is a little similar to the Council president but I wanted to dive in a little bit more to get some clarity on a few things on whether there might be disagreement or at least--like between the Council and the executive, at least to clarify if that is the case.",87,,
459,0.97,4381.176,4397.226,"The threshold matter, I just want to say I do apologize the other day if my comments are my questions to Greg and to yourself were implying that the attrition estimate is inherently unreasonable.",87,,
460,0.97,4397.226,4417.746,"I just wanted to determine if there was a different baseline but it sounds like it is just a different prediction based on the same data the executive was using and as we have seen this year, it is clearly defensible to have different projections based on that same information.",87,,
461,0.97,4417.746,4418.747,I just wanted to clarify that.,87,,
462,0.97,4418.747,4425.821,I do not think we can necessarily say either of those Attritional estimates is inherently unreasonable projection.,87,,
463,0.97,4425.821,4439.168,Not based on the attrition rate this year and how both the executive and Council projections were way off the mark in trying to anticipate that.,87,,
464,0.97,4439.168,4451.78,I do want to clarify that I was trying to see if there was a different formula or data we were using and it sounds like we are using the same but coming to different conclusions.,87,,
465,0.97,4451.78,4489.885,"I do want to dig into that a little bit more, to ask Greg to the extent--I want to know the extent to which there is agreement or disagreement between the balancing package and the Department as far as agreeing to what position is going to be vacant based on our Attritional projections, if that is part of the root--like to what extent has the Department admitted that there are vacant positions that they are seeking to fund versus what we are projecting?",87,,
466,0.97,4489.885,4499.928,"Is it the Delta of 30 some positions between, you know, there estimate an our estimate or is it more on that.",87,,
467,0.97,4499.928,4508.37,Where is the disagreement on the number of vacancies that SPD is projecting?,87,,
468,0.97,4508.37,4511.44,Thank you.,88,,
469,0.97,4511.44,4520.249,We will start out with the 134 positions for FTE.,88,,
470,0.97,4520.249,4523.151,We have been discussing it.,88,,
471,0.97,4523.151,4551.146,"That is an area we all agree on, both the executive, the technical staff, SPD, myself, everyone agrees that there are 134 FTE that are funded in the Department's budget that are not needed to support officers, student officers, and recruits that are actually in the Department and receiving pay.",88,,
472,0.97,4551.146,4559.388,"That piece, I would take a side and I think about anymore.",88,,
473,0.97,4559.388,4562.591,Now we will go to the Department's staffing plan.,88,,
474,0.97,4562.591,4570.499,The departments there have assumed 124--125 hires and 94 separations.,88,,
475,0.97,4570.499,4599.595,"Within that staffing plan that had been funded, fully funded in the Department and the proposed budget, the Council had has--the chair has made an assumption that instead of 94 separations, there will be 125 separations.",88,,
476,0.97,4599.595,4606.601,"That additional 31 separations, that is the area that there is not agreement on.",88,,
477,0.97,4606.601,4612.541,The executive would say those additional 31 separations are not going to happen.,88,,
478,0.97,4612.541,4616.445,The chair believes those 31 separations are going to happen.,88,,
479,0.97,4616.445,4654.683,"The way that those 31 separations are going to happen in the chair's package is 12 of them are going to happen in January as related to the vaccine mandate and then the rest of them are going to happen throughout the year and that would happen in the same way that the staffing plan that the Council had last year . As we all know, the staffing plan has adopted--as it was adopted last year grossly underestimated the number of separations that wound up happening.",88,,
480,0.97,4654.683,4660.889,"A follow-up, Madam chair?",89,,
481,0.97,4660.889,4668.163,We might have lost our chair.,90,,
482,0.97,4668.163,4672.567,"Go ahead, Councilmember.",90,,
483,0.97,4672.567,4674.069,"Greg, thank you for clarifying that.",91,,
484,0.97,4674.069,4679.141,I think it is just important to see what we are really talking about.,91,,
485,0.97,4679.141,4703.899,"It sounds like what we are really talking about is the 31 additional anticipated separations . I want to just get into it a little bit on that in terms of what happens in the event that the separations are closer to the executives estimate compared to the Council's estimate and what are the implications of--sorry, they have their hand up.",91,,
486,0.97,4703.899,4707.669,I am sorry.,91,,
487,0.97,4711.64,4716.111,Maybe she is not completely back yet.,91,,
488,0.97,4716.111,4719.581,Why don't you continue and it looks like she has some technology issues.,92,,
489,0.97,4719.581,4725.22,Okay.,93,,
490,0.97,4725.22,4726.154,I am here.,94,,
491,0.97,4726.154,4726.621,I am sorry.,94,,
492,0.97,4726.621,4737.065,I wanted to make sure you knew I dropped off for a second.,94,,
493,0.97,4737.065,4738.467,So I did not quite catch this.,94,,
494,0.97,4738.467,4745.34,"In answer to your question, we have reminded ourselves that we are currently expecting 150 separations.",94,,
495,0.97,4745.34,4750.245,"In 2021, we expect there to be 150 separations.",94,,
496,0.97,4750.245,4765.16,"We thought there would be 114, which is why we have the 2021 numbers reflected in 2022.",94,,
497,0.97,4765.16,4787.415,"If we expect at the end of 2021 that there will be 150 separations--if the question is how can we have greater assurance and what is the consequence if the separations that we are expecting in 2022 and not as close to the amount as we are expecting, please consider coming down from 150 because the same type of replication could happen next year.",94,,
498,0.97,4787.415,4792.42,"We are looking at how many could potentially leave, recognizing having attrition at 150.",94,,
499,0.97,4792.42,4807.536,"I want to frame that it is not relative to 125, including the officers that we assume are leaving due to accommodation availability for Covid.",94,,
500,0.97,4807.536,4808.804,"Did I say that correctly, Greg?",94,,
501,0.97,4808.804,4823.819,You did but there is more that I would need to provide to answer Council member Lewis' question.,95,,
502,0.97,4823.819,4827.522,Councilmember--would be helpful if I restated my question since you were coming back in?,95,,
503,0.97,4827.522,4830.559,"Yeah, that would be helpful.",96,,
504,0.97,4830.559,4837.966,Thank you for that summary just now because it is related.,97,,
505,0.97,4837.966,4851.446,"My question was just to ask Greg in the event that attrition comes in closer to the executive forecast, what would be the implication of that?",97,,
506,0.97,4851.446,4857.853,That was Essentialy the crux of the question.,97,,
507,0.97,4857.853,4860.689,I'm happy to turn it over to Greg to get an answer on that.,97,,
508,0.97,4860.689,4861.089,Thank you.,98,,
509,0.97,4861.089,4866.494,The reduction that is associated with the 31 is a $2.7 million reduction.,98,,
510,0.97,4866.494,4912.407,"If it is the case that the separations come in closer to what the executive is predicting, then the Council would have options . They would either have to accept that SPD's staffing plan and that it would be underfunded and at that point in time, potentially the Department would have to make a choice to stop hiring new officers for to make cuts elsewhere in the Department, to make sure they can continue to hire new officers or the Council could provide additional funding to make up for the difference.",98,,
511,0.97,4912.407,4929.357,"So that is the reality that I think the city would be facing if the Council cut of $2.7 million and the separations came closer to what the executive was projecting, rather than what the chair her budget assumes.",98,,
512,0.97,4929.357,4966.194,"One potential option to avoid that eventuality, if it was an eventuality, to avoid that potential, would be to not cut $2.7 million but to take some of that and hold it in reserve until such time that the Council was more sure that they were headed towards 31 separations as opposed to, I do not know, 15 or 20 of those separations . of course, I'm speaking Incrementally within that odd of 31.",98,,
513,0.97,4966.194,4986.581,That would be end option for the Council if they were Concernd about the projections of the chair's budget being not conservative enough relative to the executive's projections.,98,,
514,0.97,4986.581,4990.585,That is how I would answer that question.,98,,
515,0.97,4990.585,5006.735,"Just as a reminder, Greg, all of the money that could be characterized would still be under this in the budget.",99,,
516,0.97,5006.735,5018.146,"Regardless of the expectation, as they depart, that falls under the salary saving like it did this year.",99,,
517,0.97,5018.146,5029.958,As the budget--is that a correct understanding?,99,,
518,0.97,5029.958,5030.925,"Yes, that is correct.",100,,
519,0.97,5030.925,5032.127,It is tighter than this year.,100,,
520,0.97,5032.127,5044.439,"Last year, there was a $5 million salary Savings and this year the salary savings proviso what lockup any salary savings that the department had, that it could not use to pay off.",100,,
521,0.97,5044.439,5049.244,Okay.,101,,
522,0.97,5049.244,5052.48,I do not think I have any additional questions right now.,101,,
523,0.97,5052.48,5054.582,I will give it back to the budget chair.,101,,
524,0.97,5054.582,5059.154,Go ahead.,102,,
525,0.97,5059.154,5073.101,I would like to go back to the line of questioning started by Council President Gonzalez.,103,,
526,0.97,5076.838,5110.038,"So as it related to the 134 officers with vacant positions and the funding for those vacant positions and then there is proposed budget, can you restate the number of dollars that is represented by those funding those positions that SPD does not intend to hire for 2022, what the value of those positions is for 2022 and can you let us know whether or not the chairs--whether they propose the funding that same number of vacant positions if the Department does not intend to hire or if it is a different number?",103,,
527,0.97,5110.038,5121.182,The 134 FTE--the FTE equates to $19 million of salary savings.,104,,
528,0.97,5121.182,5133.461,"Some of that, the tear's budget retains in the proposals that the Department has made and some of it, it does not.",104,,
529,0.97,5133.461,5180.208,It can change or reduce and the table that we are about to go through is a pretty good representation of how that works . There are a number of additions and takes and some are technical and it eventually works out such that the Mayor had proposed 2 million more dollars over the 2021 budget and that included adding to that salary Savings and then the chair's budget reduces $10.9 million to a total of $354 million for appropriations.,104,,
530,0.97,5180.208,5219.547,"It is difficult to give you an exact number of how much of the salary savings is retained and how much of the salary savings is cut because we are talking about the overall budget, some of which is technical changes but this table does give you a good overview of the places where salary savings was directed into new investments and where in those new investments the chair has made changes, either retaining those new investments or changing them.",104,,
531,0.97,5219.547,5232.16,I have to admit I'm having a hard time tracking the Definitional use of the word salary savings.,105,,
532,0.97,5232.16,5253.948,"It sounds to me now that, Greg, you are explaining--I'm not suggesting you have not been very clear all along--when we talk about salary Savings and we talk about the use of salary savings, we are, in fact, talking about the 134 FTE funded in the Mayor's budget that they cannot hire for?",105,,
533,0.97,5253.948,5262.223,"It is not like there is--when you look at the chair's budget, there are not salary savings for another 134 FTE.",105,,
534,0.97,5262.223,5291.319,That is what I was trying to figure out and hearing folks in public comment on Wednesday talking to a request to Council to cut funding for 134 funded Ftes that the Department--the chair it was a budget does is some of that.,105,,
535,0.97,5291.319,5295.423,There is not another on top of the chair's budget.,105,,
536,0.97,5295.423,5298.593,It is not 134+134.,105,,
537,0.97,5298.593,5298.826,No.,106,,
538,0.97,5298.826,5302.73,Thank you.,106,,
539,0.97,5302.73,5306.1,It is much appreciated.,106,,
540,0.97,5306.1,5331.859,"If you Scroll down, whoever is controlling the table schools down to the bottom and you see the $17.7 million and you're asking me how that relates to the $90 million of salary savings, I am telling you that there are some technical and puts that outputs that make it difficult to describe.",107,,
541,0.97,5331.859,5346.174,"If your question is is there 134 and another 134, no.",107,,
542,0.97,5357.485,5362.89,"Greg, I think it is a clear opportunity to get us into this chart here.",108,,
543,0.97,5362.89,5366.06,I think --,108,,
544,0.97,5366.06,5373.201,"I just want to say something, I will not Belabor the point.",109,,
545,0.97,5373.201,5374.936,I will save my comments for particular minutes.,109,,
546,0.97,5374.936,5380.508,"But Madam chair, thank you for the information you gave us and your correspondence.",109,,
547,0.97,5380.508,5394.589,"I know you wanted this morning, and we got it from you, this table that Greg and you put together to explain what the confusion was, because the word ""cut"" was used in the Powerpoint.",109,,
548,0.97,5394.589,5404.232,"I think what people did not realize is the Mayor propose something, you proposed something less, which means you did not adopt the increases that the Mayor was adopting.",109,,
549,0.97,5404.232,5417.278,I will presume because I don't want to Impugn any ill will on anyone but the executive's budget for SPD had to do with need and not violating consent decree.,109,,
550,0.97,5417.278,5428.055,I also presume the budget chair made difficult decisions and so made the decision and did not cut the SPD budget but all their did not honor the executive's request for increases.,109,,
551,0.97,5428.055,5442.136,"So I am asking Madam chair, if you would also post the letter that we received from chief Diaz, on November 10th, that it should be posted as well.",109,,
552,0.97,5442.136,5453.047,"Because I think if you read chief Diaz's letter to us and your response along with Greg's chart, I think that that will clear up a lot of the confusion.",109,,
553,0.97,5453.047,5463.958,"And I shared this with you Jokingly, but I think because the word ""cut"" was used on page 9 of the Powerpoint, people ran with it.",109,,
554,0.97,5463.958,5483.11,"I just wanted to make sure that if all the correspondence is posted Online, then perhaps some people who are kind of getting more in the weeds, can see that Madam chair did not cut the Seattle police Department, rather than she just did not honor the expansion that the executive was requesting.",109,,
555,0.97,5483.11,5505.733,"I think it is important that if we see chief Diaz's letter, which outlines, right or wrong, whether we agree or disagree, why they wanted the increase, why there is an increase in violence, why they want to recruit better police officers, why they want to hire 125 officers, and keeping separations below 100.",109,,
556,0.97,5505.733,5507.869,And the Kneading staffing levels.,109,,
557,0.97,5507.869,5519.514,"They do address the dissent decree, which you address, which I appreciate you maintain that we do not violate the dissent decree.",109,,
558,0.97,5519.514,5532.36,"I think one thing that is important, I have gotten many calls about this, is that within the dissent decree, in meaning what we are supposed to do for charter for public safety, that we really do want to respond to areas of disbarment and impact.",109,,
559,0.97,5532.36,5550.845,"I think we've heard this and I think--looking at amendments, some communities and some people do not have the luxury of not meeting 911 if their life and property in children's lives depend on it.",109,,
560,0.97,5550.845,5551.445,So I H.O.P.E.,109,,
561,0.97,5551.445,5554.282,This is not a proxy for a different argument we have had before.,109,,
562,0.97,5554.282,5554.682,I H.O.P.E.,109,,
563,0.97,5554.682,5565.693,"That this, we move forward and try to fund the police Department that we do have as chief Diaz ended in his letter, that we have the best Department in the country, and I H.O.P.E.",109,,
564,0.97,5565.693,5566.961,That that is our goal.,109,,
565,0.97,5566.961,5567.361,Thank you.,109,,
566,0.97,5567.361,5571.198,I will end my comments there.,109,,
567,0.97,5571.198,5572.066,Thank you so much.,110,,
568,0.97,5572.066,5577.438,I think that is a good opportunity for us to get into the proposed chart in front of you.,110,,
569,0.97,5577.438,5580.474,"Patty, thank you for managing the sides.",110,,
570,0.97,5580.474,5582.41,If you could go up slightly.,110,,
571,0.97,5582.41,5582.677,Perfect.,110,,
572,0.97,5582.677,5584.111,Just so we can see the Headers.,110,,
573,0.97,5584.111,5591.485,The proposed increases to the Morales--SPD budget.,110,,
574,0.97,5591.485,5598.626,I want to be cognizant that we have two other sections that we still need to get to.,110,,
575,0.97,5598.626,5602.596,But I think it is important to go through these so that there is greater clarity out there.,110,,
576,0.97,5602.596,5607.335,The current proposed budget includes the $6.8 million of the new investments that the Mayor had requested.,110,,
577,0.97,5607.335,5623.851,"That is not to say there is not a future conversation to be had about some or more portion of the 17.7 here, plus the 2.2 million that Greg showed.",110,,
578,0.97,5623.851,5641.168,"Thanks to the answers, we clearly know that these are coming from 134 Ftes, that it is reasonable to assume could not even be funded and thus why the Mayor herself is proposing using a portion of these funds for increased investments.",110,,
579,0.97,5641.168,5652.847,"We have made some decisions as Councilmember Juarez noted, tough decisions, to see where dollars were imperative for the dissent decree.",110,,
580,0.97,5652.847,5657.752,Some of the technology it sounds like was deemed as needed.,110,,
581,0.97,5657.752,5659.787,So we included some of that.,110,,
582,0.97,5659.787,5671.666,"There is some additional support for overtime, 4.6 million in additional dollars for overtime, still totaling over $26.4 million this year for overtime.",110,,
583,0.97,5671.666,5681.008,And we are maintaining our 18 Tran30 four in the community service officer program.,110,,
584,0.97,5681.008,5710.738,"Ftes are important there and we just allowed for additional funding to go to that and the midyear supplemental but I want to make sure we underscore that this is still very much for us to discuss in these final days and consider various amendments on how else we would like to see the use of not just the dollars that are sitting in the proposed budget from the Mayor for these 134 positions, but if this is the right balance.",110,,
585,0.97,5710.738,5711.939,Happy to have conversations with folks.,110,,
586,0.97,5711.939,5720.648,Let's talk about what is currently in the proposed budget that totals 6.8 here.,110,,
587,0.97,5720.648,5722.55,"Greg, can you walk us through what the pieces are?",110,,
588,0.97,5722.55,5728.656,"As you do that I think it is important to start with there are no current cuts to SPD staffing, officers in the proposed budget.",110,,
589,0.97,5728.656,5735.162,With over $26 million it is reasonable to note that there would not be a Reshuffling of officers in addition to what we have already seen.,110,,
590,0.97,5735.162,5743.938,"Greg, please go ahead and feel free to fill in any details there.",110,,
591,0.97,5743.938,5744.972,Thank you Madam chair.,111,,
592,0.97,5744.972,5747.742,Given what you said I will go rather quickly until I see hands.,111,,
593,0.97,5747.742,5755.483,"The first item that is on the first row, we have not talked about, funding for travel and training.",111,,
594,0.97,5755.483,5760.855,"$175,000 increase that the Mayor put into the budget.",111,,
595,0.97,5760.855,5769.864,It is a restoration of a cut that was made in the 2021 adopted budget do to Covid.,111,,
596,0.97,5769.864,5782.81,"And that restoration is not made and that would leave a $925,000 available for the civilian travel and training budget.",111,,
597,0.97,5782.81,5784.879,I want to be clear that is for civilians.,111,,
598,0.97,5784.879,5788.883,And that assumes that the Department is going to find some efficiencies in their travel and training.,111,,
599,0.97,5788.883,5806.233,"The funding for discretionary purchases, same thing, this was a cut in the 2021 budget that the Department has been needing any cut that was not restored.",111,,
600,0.97,5806.233,5825.019,"That will leave a remaining budget of $4.1 million, the third one, funding for overtime, the Mayor's proposed budget had restored, or added $7.8 million into overtime.",111,,
601,0.97,5825.019,5826.82,This is a combination of a couple things.,111,,
602,0.97,5826.82,5837.665,"This, there was quite a large cut that was taken last year for events and other overtime that would be affected by Covid.",111,,
603,0.97,5837.665,5841.168,And in 2021.,111,,
604,0.97,5841.168,5846.674,"Indeed be Department has seen, obviously, quite a reduction there.",111,,
605,0.97,5846.674,5862.089,"And the Mayor wanted to restore the entire amount and in addition to that, there is also funding there for paid family leave and some technical adjustments.",111,,
606,0.97,5862.089,5867.895,"That is why that has a little notation, citation by it.",111,,
607,0.97,5867.895,5875.202,That is down at the bottom saying that the $7.8 million is including paid family leave funding.,111,,
608,0.97,5875.202,5881.508,"And so being mindful of that, the Council restores some of that funding but not all of it.",111,,
609,0.97,5881.508,5900.928,"It does increase the overtime budget from this year's amount, which was 21.8 million, and it increases the amount to 26.4, sufficient to fund the paid family leave and also additional overtime funding for events.",111,,
610,0.97,5900.928,5908.736,"Funding for technology is, was proposed at $5 million, for about seven different projects.",111,,
611,0.97,5908.736,5923.651,"And out of that the Council is funding $3.8 million, and that is for five of the seven projects, not funding two of them.",111,,
612,0.97,5923.651,5941.735,"I should also note that with this particular item, of course with the whole table, the use for salary savings, the Department or Council did you salary savings for similar purpose this year, there were 15 million in salary savings this year.",111,,
613,0.97,5941.735,5947.675,The Council used that funding to fund 2 1/2 million dollars in new technology this year.,111,,
614,0.97,5947.675,5961.522,"Some of the projects worth the same, the Dap, the system that the Department used to track really every kind of data that they use.",111,,
615,0.97,5961.522,5973.701,"Everything from training, to use of force, everything that they use that is tracked in the Dap, to their oath, officer accountability and trust project.",111,,
616,0.97,5973.701,5980.874,Which is using models to identify officers that may need wellness support.,111,,
617,0.97,5980.874,5988.015,There was quite a bit of investment that Council made last year and then another 3.8 million that the Council is making this year.,111,,
618,0.97,5988.015,5993.52,Choosing not to make the $1.2 million that the Mayor had proposed.,111,,
619,0.97,5993.52,6001.295,"Funding for hiring incentives is 1.1 million, and funding for community service officers, 1.3 million, that is not made.",111,,
620,0.97,6001.295,6015.642,"In the total there being 17.7, the Council choosing not to make 10.9, and the remaining being 10.8 that is made.",111,,
621,0.97,6015.642,6022.349,I just want to emphasize something you said.,112,,
622,0.97,6022.349,6028.122,"Midyear supplemental, just in September of this year there was 15 million but that was 15 million available today.",112,,
623,0.97,6028.122,6050.644,"Thanks in large part to the Provost that the Council members put together last year, the Provisos, we got word this year that it was not a significant amount of money, $15 million midway through that we have the Council worked to Reallocate . as a reminder to million of the 15 stayed within SPD.",112,,
624,0.97,6050.644,6055.783,And as Greg noted 2.5 million going to technology already.,112,,
625,0.97,6055.783,6058.051,That was just two months ago.,112,,
626,0.97,6058.051,6076.503,"When a request comes to us from several additional technology requests and the proposed budget allowing for five of those to go forward, especially the ones noted by the monitor that were important, we are adding to that money going into technology.",112,,
627,0.97,6076.503,6088.816,"One of the technology pieces we are not doing is something that as I said on Wednesday, it may be nice to have in the future as an important tool as we think about training and reducing stress and De- escalation.",112,,
628,0.97,6088.816,6100.828,But one of the Technologies would monitor the heart rate and other senses to make sure that we are better analyzing how much stress individuals have and how we can mitigate for that.,112,,
629,0.97,6100.828,6102.596,It sounds like an interesting piece of technology.,112,,
630,0.97,6102.596,6111.705,I don't know if the analysis has been done to determine if it a necessity in the city of Seattle but I know there are Federal dollars for things like that.,112,,
631,0.97,6111.705,6128.422,"When I look at a shortfall for this year and a tremendous need in the community, it is a good example for where I said that does not equal immediate assistance for folks in our community that need housing, health services, shelter, and additional support for small businesses.",112,,
632,0.97,6128.422,6142.069,"One example of why the amount of allocating the proposed budget smaller than what the Mayor requested, still an increase into the technology, in addition to the money that was just given to the apartment two months ago.",112,,
633,0.97,6142.069,6144.571,"Greg, did you get all the way through?",112,,
634,0.97,6144.571,6150.477,I have one follow-up item and then will start--stop.,113,,
635,0.97,6150.477,6154.148,On the funding for community service officers I understand there has been confusion about that particular item.,113,,
636,0.97,6154.148,6160.654,Also due to the midyear supplemental changes.,113,,
637,0.97,6160.654,6174.401,"The Mayor's 2021 budget, the adopted budget, the Mayor and Council's 2021 adopted budget, had adopted a hiring freeze on civilian positions in SPD.",113,,
638,0.97,6174.401,6179.306,That was due to the Covid related revenue crisis.,113,,
639,0.97,6179.306,6201.295,"And as the year progressed and we discovered there were quite a bit of salary savings in SPD, the Council and Department together with the midyear supplemental made the change, the decision to start using the salary savings to fund the existing vacant CSO positions.",113,,
640,0.97,6201.295,6211.338,So the entire CSO budget for the existing positions in the Department is $2.8 million.,113,,
641,0.97,6211.338,6219.613,And there had been quite a few vacancies among the 18 existing positions in the Department.,113,,
642,0.97,6219.613,6236.73,"And so the Council made the decision and along with the Department, in the midyear supplemental, to redirect some salary saving dollars to fully staff up and fully higher the 18 CSO that are in the Department's budget now.",113,,
643,0.97,6236.73,6247.841,"And the Department has recorded that by the end of the year they will have 18 Csos, the existing Lish Whitson up and running.",113,,
644,0.97,6247.841,6251.645,That is part of the base.,113,,
645,0.97,6251.645,6273.6,"These community service officers in the final row here, the 1.3 million, would have been over and above the 18 that are in the base, that would've been six more that did not get added to the base.",113,,
646,0.97,6273.6,6274.601,And now I am done.,113,,
647,0.97,6274.601,6275.002,Sorry.,113,,
648,0.97,6275.002,6276.803,I forgot to add that earlier.,113,,
649,0.97,6276.803,6279.94,I am glad you added the clarification on the CSO's.,114,,
650,0.97,6279.94,6285.779,Again repeating what I said on Wednesday.,114,,
651,0.97,6285.779,6300.127,It was the Council that advocated for the transfer the three to come back in the Council with 18 positions funded.,114,,
652,0.97,6300.127,6303.83,We will continue to the work with the Csos.,114,,
653,0.97,6303.83,6309.102,"Councilmember Lewis, please go ahead.",114,,
654,0.97,6309.102,6309.936,Thank you Madam chair.,115,,
655,0.97,6309.936,6336.063,"Before we get off the topic of the Csos, I believe the other day Councilmember Herbold mentioned that even if we were to fund the Csos in the budget, the expansion, that they likely would not be able to be hired and underway until midway through the year.",115,,
656,0.97,6336.063,6351.878,"If we were thinking of amendments and did want to, if some members did want to potentially expand community service officers in some way, even further than the commitments we already made as a Council, that there might be a different number that would be more realistic for this.",115,,
657,0.97,6351.878,6353.58,I want to make sure I remember that correctly.,115,,
658,0.97,6353.58,6359.086,"And maybe put that to Greg and Councilmember Herbold, just to remind us.",115,,
659,0.97,6359.086,6365.859,I think Councilmember Herbold is best to answer the question.,116,,
660,0.97,6365.859,6381.208,"We proposed a, well I originally proposed a $200,000 cut to the budget for the Provisos with understanding they would not be able to be hired until mid year.",117,,
661,0.97,6381.208,6382.576,The expansion.,117,,
662,0.97,6382.576,6401.728,"But the amendment that ended up moving forward for the discussion in the first round, was actually instead of a reduction by $200,000, it was a proviso that we would be able to capture if our assumptions were correct.",117,,
663,0.97,6401.728,6414.641,"That the first quarter of the year there would not be a hiring of the Csos, but the package did not move forward.",117,,
664,0.97,6414.641,6424.251,"Either a cut reflecting the first quarter of the year, nor the proviso.",117,,
665,0.97,6424.251,6441.368,Instead it made the reduction of the expansion with the understanding that we had just approved and expansion of the Council's CSO program at the midyear adjustment budget.,117,,
666,0.97,6441.368,6444.237,Can I ask a follow-up Madam chair?,118,,
667,0.97,6444.237,6446.039,Thank you.,118,,
668,0.97,6446.039,6454.881,"So, Councilmember Herbold was that Q1 delay, based on representations from folks in the Department?",118,,
669,0.97,6454.881,6456.783,That they estimated that is how long it would take.,118,,
670,0.97,6456.783,6462.489,What was the basis for that expectation?,118,,
671,0.97,6462.489,6467.394,"Greg, you want to take that?",119,,
672,0.97,6467.394,6481.575,"The folks in the Department were very optimistic, that they could hire the CSO's quickly.",120,,
673,0.97,6481.575,6498.325,At the same time they provided an answer to a Council question that said it typically takes four to five did months to higher Csos.,120,,
674,0.97,6498.325,6508.101,They said that they could cut some of that time down because they have an advertisement out now for AAA three.,120,,
675,0.97,6508.101,6509.803,Conceivably they could cut some of that time down.,120,,
676,0.97,6509.803,6515.041,"It is also the case that even if they could interview the Csos now, they would still have to background them.",120,,
677,0.97,6515.041,6529.356,So I think it is fair to say that it is unlikely that the Department would be able to higher six Csos I January 1.,120,,
678,0.97,6529.356,6547.173,It is unlikely the Department will start paying six Csos by January 1. it is far more likely they will be hiring and paying those Csos sometime closer to the end of the third quarter.,120,,
679,0.97,6547.173,6554.247,And central staff is willing to say that that is our estimate.,120,,
680,0.97,6554.247,6555.749,Thank you Greg.,121,,
681,0.97,6555.749,6559.252,That is all really helpful.,121,,
682,0.97,6559.252,6562.956,"Thank you very much, thank you Council members.",122,,
683,0.97,6562.956,6566.192,Any additional questions or comments on this?,122,,
684,0.97,6566.192,6591.017,"I will also NOTE while this does not include the money that the Mayor included in her proposed budget for the hiring incentives, our understanding is that the Mayor's team has assumed that they have enough funding within their own budgets to continue with the incentive that they announced via executive order.",122,,
685,0.97,6591.017,6600.393,"So I want to make sure that folks understand that there is still a policy conversation, I assume, to be had at the council about that.",122,,
686,0.97,6600.393,6604.731,But we are not advancing that item here at this budget.,122,,
687,0.97,6604.731,6612.639,"However, we understand the Mayor's office--existing emergency order.",122,,
688,0.97,6612.639,6615.642,I'm not sure if that is a question.,123,,
689,0.97,6615.642,6626.119,"But if it is I would say that yes, they have funding in 2021 four that, for the hiring of folks in 2021.",123,,
690,0.97,6626.119,6638.565,"In 2022, that would not be the case . that would not be the case.",123,,
691,0.97,6638.565,6643.336,Any additional comments or questions?,124,,
692,0.97,6643.336,6651.244,"So just to summarize, no cuts to the current SPD staffing, no cuts to SPD officers in the budget.",124,,
693,0.97,6651.244,6662.689,"Fully having the hiring plan with the hundred 25 new officers, funds the current and recently funded community safety officer positions at 18 positions.",124,,
694,0.97,6662.689,6670.497,Funds 3 $.8 million in new technologies in addition to the items that were added to the supplemental.,124,,
695,0.97,6670.497,6672.065,Just two months ago.,124,,
696,0.97,6672.065,6680.273,And it includes the items that the Federal Court monitor has to flag this important.,124,,
697,0.97,6680.273,6699.826,Funds 14.6 additional for overtime bringing it to eight and four .1 million for discretionary purposes and civilian positions.,124,,
698,0.97,6699.826,6704.13,"I appreciate the summary table you have created, Greg.",124,,
699,0.97,6704.13,6712.238,"I wanted to be clear this was created by Greg, so we have more of an understanding of what the increases that were proposed versus the increases that the proposed budget has.",124,,
700,0.97,6712.238,6717.644,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,125,,
701,0.97,6717.644,6738.431,Thought I would close up the conversation in general to note that historically central staff has used add or cut as the sort of shorthand for actions in the Council's budget Liberations in this conversation it is clear to me we need to change the language a little bit.,125,,
702,0.97,6738.431,6746.973,"Anything, the entire budget is a proposal so the Council is just proposing to reduce or modify proposals by the Mayor.",125,,
703,0.97,6746.973,6752.846,I look forward to working with the budget chair next year but think about how we describe these in the future to avoid this type of confusion.,125,,
704,0.97,6752.846,6758.852,The entire budget is a proposal until the Council asked on it and the Mayor signs it.,125,,
705,0.97,6758.852,6769.863,It is not added or cut or modified in any way . I just wanted to egg knowledge that--acknowledged that before we move forward in the conversation.,125,,
706,0.97,6769.863,6770.296,Thank you.,126,,
707,0.97,6770.296,6779.072,I also think it is a message to the executive.,126,,
708,0.97,6779.072,6790.917,"Misleading and Misinforming members of the community, we look forward to working across the board to make sure we use correct terminology on what we actually propose, especially when it leads to proposal increases.",126,,
709,0.97,6790.917,6797.423,I want to make sure we can round out the discussion today and the next hour and a half if we need the full-time.,126,,
710,0.97,6797.423,6801.327,We will always end earlier if we don't need to go to 1:00.,126,,
711,0.97,6801.327,6804.43,We have an opportunity to cover a few more sections.,126,,
712,0.97,6804.43,6812.705,To roundup public safety I want to complement the discussion we had about some investments with investments into community safety overall.,126,,
713,0.97,6812.705,6819.245,"Patty, you are welcome to stop sharing the screen as we transition to other items.",126,,
714,0.97,6819.245,6824.818,I'm not sure if Allie wanted to bring up other items.,126,,
715,0.97,6824.818,6828.721,It might be able to complement the pieces.,126,,
716,0.97,6828.721,6833.159,Thank you for your amendment and for your suggestions for public safety and community resilience.,126,,
717,0.97,6833.159,6860.887,"For example this is not all inclusive but want to lift up 26 positions going to the new community safety and communication center to address the 911 existing dispatch operational needs, 4 million into community safety, thank you for others that called in yesterday expressing their support for the $14 million ad that we bring back into the budget for community safety.",126,,

721,0.97,6892.886,6894.721,I was asked if these folks are on the ground.,126,,
722,0.97,6894.721,6895.121,Absolutely.,126,,
723,0.97,6895.121,6900.727,Those last three examples are people who are currently out in our community.,126,,
724,0.97,6900.727,6907.033,"Some of whom you heard call in who are working to create alternatives, alternative responses right now.",126,,
725,0.97,6907.033,6914.607,1.5 million going into mobile advocacy services for flexible assistance for survivors of Gender-Based violence.,126,,

727,0.97,6916.542,6925.818,"Half of that as Councilmember Herbold noted on Wednesday, going directly to schools for alternatives and School-Based services.",126,,
728,0.97,6925.818,6935.161,"$1.5 million going to Seattle fire Department for 20 additional firefighter recruits, over 1 million going to the triage one team.",126,,
729,0.97,6935.161,6936.829,Fully funding our health teams out there.,126,,
730,0.97,6936.829,6945.071,I want to scale that up in the future and hearing from the Department we need to also do that in a way that helps be sure they are implement will.,126,,
731,0.97,6945.071,6952.178,"All of these items are coming from you Council members directly, moving this forward on behalf of community partners.",126,,
732,0.97,6952.178,6961.287,You deserve the credit for the investments and wanted to just pause here a second to see if there's anything else you would want to lift up.,126,,
733,0.97,6961.287,6962.555,Especially in the response to public safety.,126,,
734,0.97,6962.555,6966.459,"Investments and the call for us to do more, we have done more here.",126,,
735,0.97,6966.459,6985.378,"In addition to the direct investments that we just talked about through Greg's chart, you have all made really significant requests for additional strategies to invest directly into public safety through community led strategies and alternative first responders.",126,,
736,0.97,6985.378,6995.922,Many of those I just noted--anything else on public safety?,126,,
737,0.97,6995.922,6998.524,"Okay, let's take the next section to talk about what is in housing.",126,,
738,0.97,6998.524,7002.595,Is that right?,126,,
739,0.97,7002.595,7005.331,Great.,126,,
740,0.97,7005.331,7006.599,We can move to housing.,127,,
741,0.97,7006.599,7011.137,"Patty, if you can put the housing summary table on the screen, I will turn it over to my colleague Tracy.",127,,
742,0.97,7011.137,7011.938,To take it away.,127,,
743,0.97,7011.938,7013.039,Good morning Council members.,128,,
744,0.97,7013.039,7013.539,"Tracy, central staff.",128,,
745,0.97,7013.539,7028.354,Reminding folks that the chair's proposed bouncing package does include 97 million dollars in Jumpstart funds.,128,,
746,0.97,7028.354,7033.659,"In the--program about $75 million, peering up for baseline of about $82 million.",128,,
747,0.97,7033.659,7040.566,The community focus acquisition and preservation gets $15.7 million in the chair's proposed package.,128,,
748,0.97,7040.566,7062.288,"The homeownership that would create opportunities for equitable homeownership gets 5.8 million, that is paired with about $7.8 million, and finally the operation and maintenance funding not funding with the Jumpstart now that I think about it but about $6 million.",128,,
749,0.97,7062.288,7071.297,"That totals for you, $97 million and how it is proposed and a little about what the base funding is existing for the key programs.",128,,
750,0.97,7071.297,7078.604,"Moving to a couple of the notable changes, first is 0181 that adds $200,000 to the home and H.O.P.E.",128,,
751,0.97,7078.604,7079.772,Program.,128,,
752,0.97,7079.772,7086.612,The program that helps with Predevelopment work on Company- owned sites.,128,,
753,0.97,7086.612,7095.421,"Community partners helps us with and that is funding that will go in addition to the $200,000 in the base budget.",128,,
754,0.97,7095.421,7101.227,"About $400,000 for that in 2022 is proposed.",128,,
755,0.97,7101.227,7113.206,"Oh 602, $20,000 for the home for good program.",128,,
756,0.97,7113.206,7118.344,We first started funding this and it will continue into 2022.,128,,
757,0.97,7118.344,7125.651,"087B01, adding $250,000 of General fund for Predevelopment cost for housing project at North Seattle college.",128,,
758,0.97,7125.651,7152.745,"In the last couple our ads to Seattle Department of construction inspections, a consultant to do a rental market study and finally $1.5 million in general fund for code compliance to implement the new economic relocation assistance ordinates.",128,,
759,0.97,7152.745,7155.348,"And the final one is $400,000 for tenant services contracts.",128,,
760,0.97,7155.348,7173.299,"Tracy, could you remind us then with the combination of these actions, amendments, the Jumpstart funds and base budget, approximately how much in total would be in the proposed budget with the chair's package.",129,,
761,0.97,7173.299,7178.804,"So including the base, Jumpstart, amendments.",129,,
762,0.97,7178.804,7191.684,"Over $194 million and just to be clear, we didn't address some additional programs in Oh that have additional funding.",130,,
763,0.97,7191.684,7195.521,Like a home repair program and administration cost for Oh.,130,,
764,0.97,7195.521,7205.198,If you total all of those things you are over $194 million in the budget.,130,,
765,0.97,7205.198,7209.035,"To highlight that, it includes about $92 million that we would expect to see annually in the base budget.",131,,
766,0.97,7209.035,7218.811,You add to that $97 million restoring a Jumpstart fund that will be at a minimum the annual increase of investments in housing.,131,,
767,0.97,7218.811,7219.445,Plus these actions.,131,,
768,0.97,7219.445,7232.325,And as Tracy noted certain programs the office of housing are not through Jumpstart but an ongoing source through a levy or other sources.,131,,
769,0.97,7232.325,7253.379,"Jumpstart does add ongoing funding to increase in a few key spaces like the community driven projects with priority for and working with Bipoc communities and ongoing increases of the initiative, including housing and Non- housing.",131,,
770,0.97,7253.379,7261.087,In those projects.,131,,
771,0.97,7261.087,7263.256,Thank you.,132,,
772,0.97,7263.256,7265.458,Thank you for walking through this.,132,,
773,0.97,7265.458,7273.799,We have heard from community members every single day that we all have been on Council these past few years.,132,,
774,0.97,7273.799,7277.67,"Especially during the crisis of Covid, that housing is the most important thing.",132,,
775,0.97,7277.67,7292.118,"The reason we start to see many individuals fall into homelessness, that we have not built in and created access to the affordable housing we need at this scale.",132,,
776,0.97,7292.118,7298.591,But we have been doing so much over the last few years to increase that number of individuals who have been able to access the and Ofa dollars.,132,,
777,0.97,7298.591,7305.164,We went to around the year Nofa opportunities.,132,,
778,0.97,7305.164,7328.387,We have around the acquisitions to create more opportunities for folks to have not just property but potentially purchase any buildings that will go up on the market with our acquisition dollars first lifting the cap to 30 million and then lifting it completely with Jumpstart Seattle.,132,,
779,0.97,7328.387,7352.878,"We have made improvements in the administration of finance plan to make sure that those who have been most directly affected by displacement and the effects, historic effects of Redlining and to Tory policies, and organizations especially led to buy communities of displacement, have an opportunity to build housing, Prioritizing housing for those communities so folks can have greater Self- determination, and create opportunities to get out of generational poverty and create generational wealth.",132,,
780,0.97,7352.878,7358.584,All of these investments are things we have done in addition to this year.,132,,
781,0.97,7358.584,7360.786,"I have been using 192, but when 94 is even better.",132,,
782,0.97,7360.786,7366.892,Over 190 million dollars going into affordable housing is a historic investment.,132,,
783,0.97,7366.892,7376.202,"Twice the amount, about twice the amount we have seen go in from previous years.",132,,
784,0.97,7376.202,7393.519,"Colleagues, I think it is an important element as we lift up as we look from exits of chronic poverty, shelter capacity, we must upgrade affordable housing for our community, most vulnerable neighbors, those currently here and those who want to move here.",132,,
785,0.97,7393.519,7412.338,"We are excited about the way the proposed budget holds on those past polities, including that our Bipoc community and those that need access to affordable housing, and First- time homeownership as a Council together on Jumpstart now funding with the proposed budget.",132,,
786,0.97,7412.338,7425.851,"Very thankful for the work you all have done to add to this list and I want to make sure as we think about housing and housing policies generally, we recognize these dollars are beyond just dollars at this point.",132,,
787,0.97,7425.851,7430.022,We've doubled the amount to go to affordable housing.,132,,
788,0.97,7430.022,7432.558,A few components are included that I will lift up as well.,132,,
789,0.97,7432.558,7446.472,"We have made sure that the Nofa funds, the funds available that we make available for affordable housing production of affordable housing units is currently at 35 million.",132,,
790,0.97,7446.472,7453.646,However we know 14 projects have applied for this money and that totals over $120 million.,132,,
791,0.97,7453.646,7465.09,"So we have a CBA here, office of housing, 010, that is an amendment that I put forward that allows us to right now free up the dollars that office of housing is anticipating because of Jumpstart.",132,,
792,0.97,7465.09,7471.397,In this amendment allows for those future dollars to go into shovel ready projects.,132,,
793,0.97,7471.397,7472.398,Right now that have applied.,132,,
794,0.97,7472.398,7479.138,We can bring forward these dollars and use them to build affordable housing.,132,,
795,0.97,7479.138,7485.11,Right now Leveraging state and Federal dollars that also make themselves available.,132,,
796,0.97,7485.11,7488.013,This is exactly what we need to do in these moments of crisis.,132,,
797,0.97,7488.013,7493.919,"I want to thank as well Councilmember Morales, you're interested work to expand with notice to intent to sell.",132,,
798,0.97,7493.919,7498.524,Clearly the legislation was written before we could do something more in the lines of the tenant opportunity purchase act.,132,,
799,0.97,7498.524,7504.93,Back to the Washington Supreme Court to pave the way for us to change the policies we currently have.,132,,
800,0.97,7504.93,7541.267,"We have a statement of legislative intent, office of housing, 004, to make sure that this works with Council and SDC I, to direct our city in the first part of next year to make policy considerations, recommendations, enhance enforcement, strengthen provisions, and ensure that a right of first refusal for tenants to truly purchase things as a policy that we change in addition to making Sharia funding and technical assistant mechanisms to support that.",132,,
801,0.97,7541.267,7542.468,A lot more work to come.,132,,
802,0.97,7542.468,7546.639,I want to thank not just Councilmember Morales but Councilmember Herbold as well for your ongoing policy conversations around that.,132,,
803,0.97,7546.639,7551.076,I know there is a few others that others may want to make note of that got included here.,132,,
804,0.97,7551.076,7563.555,Any other comments or questions on housing would be welcomed as we explain to folks not just what is in here but a better understanding of affordable housing this afternoon.,132,,
805,0.97,7563.555,7572.498,Any questions or items you would like?,132,,
806,0.97,7572.498,7573.098,Okay.,133,,
807,0.97,7573.098,7584.543,"Let's move on to homeless services, and let's integrate into that the conversation around behavioral health.",133,,
808,0.97,7584.543,7588.614,"I think it is two sections, homeless services as well as behavioral health that we will take a walk through.",133,,
809,0.97,7588.614,7589.615,Thank you for joining us.,133,,
810,0.97,7589.615,7593.218,After that we will go to any other sections that folks would like to call attention to.,133,,
811,0.97,7593.218,7599.425,I have an example and brand-new investments.,133,,
812,0.97,7599.425,7601.46,We will look at that after homelessness.,133,,
813,0.97,7601.46,7605.597,Thank you Madam chair.,134,,
814,0.97,7605.597,7616.041,"Is a high-level summary of actions in this package--three main buckets, to the first as you already Tdot.",134,,
815,0.97,7616.041,7620.746,"I want to talk to you about homelessness investments, specifically around the authority.",134,,
816,0.97,7620.746,7638.33,"The Council has asked to look at three different new investments, one related to a shelter, and Ministry of cost for agency to operate and a third, funding to seed funding and create navigation program funded with Medicaid going forward.",134,,
817,0.97,7638.33,7646.071,"Two of the items that requested ongoing funding, your package provides funding for.",134,,
818,0.97,7646.071,7654.046,"There is $5 million towards a shelter that would, I should go into that more.",134,,
819,0.97,7654.046,7662.588,There is $5 million as a vision to response partly the request to create a new shelter.,134,,
820,0.97,7662.588,7681.206,"There has been engagement in the Council both around the need to fill in gaps in behavioral health system, and all Council members are aware there is a substantial amount of overlap between those who utilize crisis behavioral health services and people expressing homelessness.",134,,
821,0.97,7681.206,7682.841,Even though they are two separate distinct programs.,134,,
822,0.97,7682.841,7689.882,So in this case with $5 million of the--the Council gets a Twofer in the investments.,134,,
823,0.97,7689.882,7707.232,"Through collaborative discussions with the county we understand that there is a variety of pathways which the county is looking to both expand behavioral health crisis response system, through something like a voluntary crisis center.",134,,
824,0.97,7707.232,7715.407,And in similar fashion there is separate work to provide services and operations to try to expand shelter capacity.,134,,
825,0.97,7715.407,7718.944,"And there was, looking at that end, other pieces as well.",134,,
826,0.97,7718.944,7731.724,"Looking Holistically at that package, acknowledging that there will be the actual people that are served, the county still had the shortfall for the the larger package being developed.",134,,
827,0.97,7731.724,7751.076,"What is being developed, what allowed the Pathway to go forward, the Council is essentially getting both the behavioral investment that would allow the expansion crisis services and expansion shelter services that would be targeted toward a population that has high needs.",134,,
828,0.97,7751.076,7756.381,As initially proposed from original homeless authority to Council.,134,,
829,0.97,7756.381,7759.251,Let's pause there really quick.,135,,
830,0.97,7759.251,7764.356,I want to make sure we answer a question we have been getting from some community partners.,135,,
831,0.97,7764.356,7781.206,"What about where the items from the regional homelessness authority ended up? fully funding from administration and adding to that amount in our proposed budget and this piece you outlined, in terms of the location for the high Acuity needs folks to have somewhere to go is critical.",135,,
832,0.97,7781.206,7785.077,"And Councilmember Lewis, I see your hand up.",135,,
833,0.97,7785.077,7791.016,You and Councilmember Gonzalez and one other that I'm forgetting worthy sponsors.,135,,
834,0.97,7791.016,7802.361,So please go ahead and make any comments and helps to draw out for folks the aspiration and where we see overlap in the proposal.,135,,
835,0.97,7802.361,7804.73,My question relates to something else Councilmember Mosqueda.,136,,
836,0.97,7804.73,7827.419,But I'm happy to reach that briefly and again my deep appreciation for your flexibility in giving a out of time to myself and Councilmember Gonzalez to meet with you as well as leaders from the regional homelessness authority to get plenty of feedback and how we could incorporate their priorities in the budget.,136,,
837,0.97,7827.419,7841.867,"You know, notably, as we discussed a lot, there is the revenue forecast that came in that has limited a lot of what we can do as a Council.",136,,
838,0.97,7841.867,7872.097,"But I do think it is important to really highlight the high Acuity shelter and behavioral health services and also the skill in Councilmember Mosqueda bringing in some regional commitments on that, to have that go a little bit further or start the conversation around some regional commitments to have some shared cost on that high Acuity sheltered the rural health service.",136,,
839,0.97,7872.097,7880.706,"That is a really, really big gap that we have seen in our current homelessness response system.",136,,
840,0.97,7880.706,7895.32,"I will share very briefly that there was a--operation recently at the Pergola and between 30 or 40 people staying there, depending on a given day.",136,,
841,0.97,7895.32,7908.634,And like the five folks that were hardest a place were people experiencing needs that could be addressed by a facility like this where there is currently a big gap in the system.,136,,
842,0.97,7908.634,7918.61,"And it really is, you know, like that 10, you know, like I hazard to put a percentage on it but like that 1 out of 10 people expressing homelessness that have the level of Acuity we currently cannot serve.",136,,
843,0.97,7918.61,7928.52,And the budget goes a long way towards holding capacity to respond to that.,136,,
844,0.97,7928.52,7935.394,I do want to state that as far as I am concerned this is the beginning of a roadmap to really chart our relationship with the Rha and build on these investments.,136,,
845,0.97,7935.394,7937.562,I don't think this is the end of the conversation at all.,136,,
846,0.97,7937.562,7940.565,And I know that is Councilmember Mosqueda's intention as well.,136,,
847,0.97,7940.565,7953.979,And I look forward to taking this first step by continuing throughout 2022 to see what we can do to build on this work to fill those service gaps and respond to the huge need that we see out in the community.,136,,
848,0.97,7953.979,7957.683,Thank you very much.,137,,
849,0.97,7957.683,7961.153,"Jeff, I think you can continue on.",137,,
850,0.97,7961.153,7961.586,Great.,138,,
851,0.97,7961.586,7962.387,Thank you.,138,,
852,0.97,7962.387,7974.399,"So overall Councilmember Lewis and you touched on this, we have three asks.",138,,
853,0.97,7974.399,7978.17,-- the two that require an ongoing commitment are both fulfilled and responded to in some way.,138,,
854,0.97,7978.17,7989.281,For one of them it was not the full amount requested but the $5 million I just discussed is one of the larger investments in the package.,138,,
855,0.97,7989.281,7989.815,Larger new investments.,138,,
856,0.97,7989.815,8003.328,"I want to make sure we are not comparing the 5 million to a 19 dueling dollar asked, when--$19 million asked, when we have King county in partnership with us to acquire the site and then work together to ensure services.",139,,
857,0.97,8003.328,8011.837,I think that will make sure we are not only citing something but also able to cite effectively and then hand off a cited program to Rha.,139,,
858,0.97,8011.837,8015.14,It is not just 5 million as everyone knows.,139,,
859,0.97,8015.14,8031.123,I am excited about the component I want to thank King County for the work they are doing to make sure we draw up the dollar amount and meet the desired need to serve the population as Councilmember Lewis just noted.,139,,
860,0.97,8031.123,8039.064,The only item that was not receiving funding in the balancing package was the seed money essentially to create the navigation program.,140,,
861,0.97,8039.064,8052.477,"And is Council members are aware from the presentations that have been made, there is a statement from the Council in recognizing that to some degree the navigation is a component of many things that are already funded.",140,,
862,0.97,8052.477,8070.295,"And encouraging the further examination of how to increase the important aspect or missing niche that the navigators filled in those various service components, such as homeless service contracts and other ways too.",140,,
863,0.97,8070.295,8075.867,Sometimes informal ways in which they are incorporated and encouraged to work there.,140,,
864,0.97,8075.867,8094.086,"The initial seed funding, while reimbursement was set up in a team, was not provided but still authorities encouraged in setting up--ongoing funding stream and move forward.",140,,
865,0.97,8094.086,8095.287,Councilmember Lewis.,140,,
866,0.97,8095.287,8101.626,I see that your hand is up.,140,,
867,0.97,8101.626,8102.594,Should we pause here?,140,,
868,0.97,8102.594,8103.695,"Yes, thank you very much.",141,,
869,0.97,8103.695,8108.934,Did you get a chance to summarize that fully before we take questions?,141,,
870,0.97,8108.934,8109.434,Jeff?,141,,
871,0.97,8109.434,8110.402,Thank you.,141,,
872,0.97,8110.402,8112.904,"Council member Lewis, please go ahead.",141,,
873,0.97,8112.904,8120.245,"It's a little different Jeff, but you brought up Medicaid reimbursement.",142,,
874,0.97,8120.245,8127.018,I want to get this out now because I think it is relevant to a lot of things in this category.,142,,
875,0.97,8127.018,8153.378,"But I just saw that FEMA has propagated guidance that they will find 100% of recovery of expenses for things like project--in California, a hotel based sheltering program in California that in the middle of the pandemic got thousands of people expressing homelessness off the street and into hotels with some kind of attendant services.",142,,
876,0.97,8153.378,8166.658,And it has been reported that the Biden administration is expanding 100% of reimbursement through FEMA through April 1ST of 2022.,142,,
877,0.97,8166.658,8172.397,And I wonder what the implications are for investments in this category.,142,,
878,0.97,8172.397,8184.809,And ways that the Council and the budget process might structure encouragement to seek FEMA reimbursement.,142,,
879,0.97,8184.809,8191.983,Or maybe if there is ways or information we have heard from the executive on their intent to seek reimbursement for some of these things here.,142,,
880,0.97,8191.983,8197.889,"And just generally Jeff, I know you spend a lot of time over 2021 looking into this.",142,,
881,0.97,8197.889,8211.536,"May be your analysis on what might or might not be eligible for that kind of seeking of reimbursement, given that deadline and guidance from the Biden administration.",142,,
882,0.97,8211.536,8213.505,Certainly.,143,,
883,0.97,8213.505,8216.708,Thank you for raising that Councilmember.,143,,
884,0.97,8216.708,8238.563,"I would highlight the project in California, or even some activities that were undertaken to expand Non-Congregant shelters in Seattle, are all reimbursed by FEMA under the category of Non-Congregant shelter.",143,,
885,0.97,8238.563,8250.475,"They had a specific purpose for preventing further spread of Covid and transmission, especially among people who otherwise would have no pace place to shelter I. the extension of that is a policy that was implemented initially months ago.",143,,
886,0.97,8250.475,8259.751,"To say that all expenditures in the category would be reimbursed and the Council had a lot of discussions this last January, I believe, related to that.",143,,
887,0.97,8259.751,8270.929,The extension would just indicate that the further the activities stood up for that type of a purpose would continue to receive full reimbursement.,143,,
888,0.97,8275.533,8278.87,Jeff just froze on my end.,144,,
889,0.97,8278.87,8282.173,-- and things like that.,145,,
890,0.97,8282.173,8282.607,Oh.,146,,
891,0.97,8282.607,8285.61,"Jeff, you may want --",146,,
892,0.97,8285.61,8286.311,Is that better?,147,,
893,0.97,8286.311,8287.479,Yes.,148,,
894,0.97,8287.479,8291.783,"Turnoff the Video, thank you.",149,,
895,0.97,8291.783,8295.92,"As the wind wind blows, my connection gets a little choppy.",149,,
896,0.97,8295.92,8299.124,If that breaks then I will switch to a different line.,149,,
897,0.97,8299.124,8314.739,"The question about FEMA reimbursement and bring up project room key, not clear to me that it would be necessarily in a category that would be eligible for FEMA reimbursement.",149,,
898,0.97,8314.739,8318.743,There is specific things that FEMA would offer reimbursement for at that level.,149,,
899,0.97,8318.743,8326.851,"I don't know, it might fall in other categories I'm not million with.",149,,
900,0.97,8326.851,8332.19,Certainly would not be Non- Congregant shelter as it is not providing shelter on a response to homelessness.,149,,
901,0.97,8332.19,8337.729,Does that answer your question Councilmember Lewis?,149,,
902,0.97,8337.729,8341.166,"I think I have two Follow- UPS if that is okay Madam chair, just briefly on this.",150,,
903,0.97,8341.166,8342.867,"And Jeff, I am sorry.",150,,
904,0.97,8342.867,8351.976,"I was speaking more generally just because you broke, because you brought up the term Medicare reimbursement.",150,,
905,0.97,8351.976,8354.579,I think I have two follow-up questions.,150,,
906,0.97,8354.579,8370.095,"One is to clarify when we hear 100% FEMA reimbursement, that does not necessarily mean to my understanding 100% reimbursement for everything that happens in Non-Congregant shelters.",150,,
907,0.97,8370.095,8377.268,But 100% of the eligible expenses.,150,,
908,0.97,8377.268,8381.539,So I think for part of where you cut out you were getting into that and I did not quite here.,150,,
909,0.97,8381.539,8388.58,Maybe if you could break that down of what might be in and what might be out of some of our current emergency shelter programs.,150,,
910,0.97,8388.58,8401.726,"And if there might be an implication to keep them going past the deadline currently set in January, if we know there will be a prospect of further FEMA reimbursement.",150,,
911,0.97,8401.726,8446.271,"And then the second thing would be when some of those assets have to be stood up to best the FEMA reimbursement, like at what point, if we set up something new, like for example these tiny House villages that are coming Online right now, like in the fall, could we petition for FEMA reimbursement for those up through April 1ST of 2022? at what point does it have to be built for us to be able to seek the reimbursement?",150,,
912,0.97,8446.271,8450.975,On the latter piece I would have to get back to you in terms of when something had to be stood up.,151,,
913,0.97,8450.975,8459.317,There has been varying deadlines and changes and extensions and just the exact details are not top of mind for me.,151,,
914,0.97,8459.317,8467.759,"In terms of what is covered, FEMA is approaching this as a sheltering type of thing.",151,,
915,0.97,8467.759,8472.697,A situation to provide safe spaces for people.,151,,
916,0.97,8472.697,8476.267,The service component we layer on top of shelters is not something that would be reimbursed.,151,,
917,0.97,8476.267,8487.312,So our enhanced shelters strongly focus on providing case management and support for an individual or household to move into housing.,151,,
918,0.97,8487.312,8495.32,"That is not something FEMA would reimburse for, that is addressing the homelessness problem, not addressing the public health and emergency of Covid.",151,,
919,0.97,8495.32,8509.934,However FEMA would reimburse for the actual cost and I will say operations that might be a little bit of a program that you could have a place for people to be.,151,,
920,0.97,8509.934,8519.744,"So think, a Janitorial service, Tking out the trash, at a building that you have acquired or leased or something like that.",151,,
921,0.97,8519.744,8522.747,Those are the types of things that FEMA would reimburse for in a Non-Congregant space.,151,,
922,0.97,8522.747,8533.224,"There are other considerations, not the least of which that you have to competitively procure the services and the locations.",151,,
923,0.97,8533.224,8538.463,Many of the programs that the city launched don't need that special.,151,,
924,0.97,8538.463,8540.765,"Some do, not although.",151,,
925,0.97,8540.765,8545.47,So there is a little bit of nuance there.,151,,
926,0.97,8545.47,8566.157,"And in terms of some of the specific projects you have in mind, we could probably spend some time engaging and doing follow-up to specific sense of if a certain project like Lish Whitson like which just opened, or another tiny home village, where that could be reimbursed by FEMA.",151,,
927,0.97,8566.157,8574.399,"Thank you Jeff, I have no additional questions that I might follow-up off-line on a few things but thank you.",152,,
928,0.97,8574.399,8576.801,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,153,,
929,0.97,8576.801,8583.775,"Okay, excuse me, Jeff, these, go ahead if you have other items you would like to lift up.",153,,
930,0.97,8583.775,8588.413,I did want to give an overview have you asked Madam chair.,154,,
931,0.97,8588.413,8597.822,"Maybe I should say one more item, Jeff, about the peer navigator peace and to underscore what Councilmember Lewis has noted as well.",155,,
932,0.97,8597.822,8611.803,"I really want to emphasize what you said during the briefing on, with the members from regional homelessness society, excuse me, the regional homelessness authority.",155,,
933,0.97,8611.803,8623.081,"That we are excited to work with them as this concept has generated a lot of conversations, conversations directly with the county and community organizations as well.",155,,
934,0.97,8623.081,8638.73,"I understand they are beginning to bring together their outreach and become peer navigator focused Cohort to talk about what this could look like, what the theory of change is, where these navigators could work, and how it all comes together.",155,,
935,0.97,8638.73,8640.531,That is fantastic work.,155,,
936,0.97,8640.531,8658.383,"I want to thank them and underscore this is a great opportunity to note the importance of these conversations coming, making sure we are working in an intersection away around this piece, to show ongoing interest in this limit.",155,,
937,0.97,8658.383,8659.65,Anything else?,155,,
938,0.97,8659.65,8659.851,Okay.,155,,
939,0.97,8659.851,8662.086,Let's keep going.,155,,
940,0.97,8662.086,8663.554,Behavioral health then.,156,,
941,0.97,8663.554,8679.404,"Admission, the five, the HLM 12, we can call it homelessness and, sorry Patty, that's a fine screen right there.",156,,
942,0.97,8679.404,8689.681,"Capital Hom 12, homelessness and behavioral health investments.",156,,
943,0.97,8689.681,8702.193,"Suddenly there is another $3.4 million in behavioral health services across a range of four different other budget actions that would expand, most noticeably crisis response services.",156,,
944,0.97,8702.193,8711.202,Also mental behavioral health and substance disorder services and for other places and populations.,156,,
945,0.97,8711.202,8717.241,"And Lastly, as an overview, there are six other actions related to homelessness.",156,,
946,0.97,8717.241,8718.443,Not included what we already discussed.,156,,
947,0.97,8718.443,8720.945,Those a up to a little bit less than $3 million.,156,,
948,0.97,8720.945,8728.453,And those often overlap with areas that the original homelessness authority has identified as priority areas to work on.,156,,
949,0.97,8728.453,8732.957,Spotting to people who are residing in Rvs or their cars.,156,,
950,0.97,8732.957,8740.565,Nearly $3 million actually supports new services in that space for regional authority to undertake new work.,156,,
951,0.97,8740.565,8745.57,That is all of my summary comments.,156,,
952,0.97,8745.57,8745.937,Wonderful.,157,,
953,0.97,8745.937,8753.745,"Any additional comments, questions that folks would like to flag on homelessness or behavioral health services before we take other areas?",157,,
954,0.97,8753.745,8753.945,Okay.,157,,
955,0.97,8753.945,8757.648,Hearing none.,157,,
956,0.97,8757.648,8760.485,I appreciate the Walk-Through with that.,157,,
957,0.97,8760.485,8768.192,And we can turn it to other sections people would like to address.,157,,
958,0.97,8768.192,8773.998,Any questions you have that might relate to possible amendments you are considering this afternoon?,157,,
959,0.97,8773.998,8774.298,Okay.,157,,
960,0.97,8774.298,8778.269,I am not seeing any.,157,,
961,0.97,8778.269,8778.603,Okay.,157,,
962,0.97,8778.603,8784.008,Wonderful.,157,,
963,0.97,8784.008,8784.675,"Well, council colleagues.",157,,
964,0.97,8784.675,8789.18,I think we have reached the end of the agenda for the four areas we want to highlight this morning.,157,,
965,0.97,8789.18,8798.089,"I know that there are so much more after the proposed budget, I know Councilmember Juarez says ""gay.",157,,
966,0.97,8798.089,8806.13,"""with the transportation, talking about bridges, bridges.",157,,
967,0.97,8806.13,8812.804,And the transportation that the systems will create for folks to get out of their cars.,157,,
968,0.97,8812.804,8831.289,"Really excited about the investments here, the livability in cities, making sure that everybody has the opportunity to clean up outside and activate streets, create public spaces, improve lighting, and make sure that there is playground investments.",157,,
969,0.97,8831.289,8836.694,Very excited about these in the proposed package.,157,,
970,0.97,8836.694,8837.161,I H.O.P.E.,157,,
971,0.97,8837.161,8854.178,"Folks have a chance to read through the entire proposed budget, as you consider the moments you are taking into account, please NOTE the conversation we had throughout this morning about the reality of the proposed uses of funds, and I H.O.P.E.",157,,
972,0.97,8854.178,8864.555,"That we offered some clarification today, the members of the community, who are interested in following along and concerned about any press releases they saw.",157,,
973,0.97,8864.555,8865.256,I H.O.P.E.,157,,
974,0.97,8865.256,8870.361,Today's clarification offers the ability to truly understand what is in this proposed budget.,157,,
975,0.97,8870.361,8877.802,"And, well, give us a better sense of how they can possibly be changed.",157,,
976,0.97,8877.802,8887.011,"One thing we did not NOTE is the proposed budget has five times the amount of funding going into First-Time homeownership opportunities, compared to previous years.",157,,
977,0.97,8887.011,8902.727,"I am really excited about creating stability, hopefully, as we recover from this Covid crisis and I look forward to continuing to work with all of you over the next week here as we finalize amendments on the discussion for Thursday and Friday of next week.",157,,
978,0.97,8902.727,8903.995,"Aly, anything else to add?",157,,
979,0.97,8903.995,8911.502,"Any other Council members liking to add anything else, contacts, questions, for they consider amendments?",157,,
980,0.97,8911.502,8911.702,Okay.,157,,
981,0.97,8911.702,8914.739,We have reached the end of the agenda.,157,,
