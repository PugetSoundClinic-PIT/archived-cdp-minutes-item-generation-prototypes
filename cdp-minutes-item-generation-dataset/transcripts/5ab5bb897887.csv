175,0.9012672901153564,1064.6,1065.1,All right.,,,
176,0.9012672901153564,1065.1,1065.4,So,,,
177,0.8979477882385254,1065.6,1072.9," The first budget issue is Transit master plan implementation, and for this discussion out, primarily be referring to the Chart.",,,
178,0.8979477882385254,1072.9,1073.5,That's on page.,,,
179,0.8979477882385254,1073.5,1077.7,"Three of your materials that chart draws on information, that's in a table.",,,
180,0.8979477882385254,1077.7,1080.7,Also in the memorandum that table is on page 19.,,,
181,0.8979477882385254,1080.8,1087.2,"He'll also be referring to a table, which is on page, 5 the details, the TMP implementation ads.",,,
182,0.8979477882385254,1087.2,1095.5,"So I'll just briefly go through the proposed TMP, implementation budget, remind the Council of some budgeting and capital planning axioms that apply",,,
183,0.9015093445777893,1095.5,1103.5," Here and then briefly walk through the ads by category priority bus, corridors non HCT streetcars and high-capacity Transit.",,,
184,0.9015093445777893,1103.5,1111.9,"So turning to the chart on page 3, the proposed budget adds 10 million to the 8.1 million in the endorsed.",,,
185,0.9015093445777893,1111.9,1118.6,"With that addition there's still eight hundred, sixty million dollars, unsecured to implement the transit master plan.",,,
186,0.9015093445777893,1118.7,1124.9,So the chart this is similar to what was in your memorandum and your books last year.,,,
187,0.8799067139625549,1125.7,1130.6," Details the ads, the green is secured funding as of the 2013 budget.",,,
188,0.8799067139625549,1130.9,1132.3,There's a Thin Blue Line there.,,,
189,0.8799067139625549,1132.3,1136.7,"That really only shows up on the TMP, priority bus corridors, which is funding in the endorsed.",,,
190,0.8799067139625549,1137.4,1149.2,"There is a the yellow is the addition and the proposed 2014 budget, but also, primarily shows up in the TMP, priority bus, corridors histogram,",,,
191,0.8509863018989563,1150.3,1157.2," Pile there and then there's some secured funding in the in the 2015-2019 see IP, which is in purple.",,,
192,0.8509863018989563,1157.5,1160.4,And the remainder of course is is unsecured funding.,,,
193,0.8100829720497131,1161.6,1170.3, So just a reminder of a couple of budgeting and capital planning axioms that apply here more or less and that's generally HCT project.,,,
194,0.8100829720497131,1170.3,1184.1,"So primarily rail projects require a longer planning Horizon and priority bus Corridor projects, some priority bus quarter projects can be implemented incrementally so the city can fund improvements block by block to make some of the approved.",,,
195,0.8100829720497131,1184.1,1191.3,Make some of the necessary improvements to bus Corridor and HCT design and planning can advance for,,,
196,0.9128386378288269,1191.6,1194.1, Additional funding but HCT construction.,,,
197,0.9128386378288269,1195.1,1198.4,Pretty much cannot proceed until all funding is secured.,,,
198,0.8977988958358765,1199.6,1203.7," So, for that, the city will likely need some kind of a funding partner in Sound Transit.",,,
199,0.8977988958358765,1203.7,1204.8,Is the obvious one there.,,,
200,0.8977988958358765,1204.8,1215.0,"So, walking through the projects by category, I'm turning to table to now, there are three categories that we've set out here for you.",,,
201,0.8977988958358765,1215.0,1229.0,And I think that Nick counseling burglar caught as a question that last statement that appears on page for the executive indicates that funding in the proposed budget includes work that particular for the ages.,,,
202,0.8306241631507874,1229.3,1235.4, ATT projects that must be completed in order to formulate detailed funding plans.,,,

204,0.8306241631507874,1239.9,1242.5,Why would you apply for funding?,,,
205,0.8306241631507874,1242.5,1246.2,"Not knowing what your, what Your funding plan is?",,,
206,0.8204989433288574,1248.1,1249.8, Maybe I'm not understanding.,,,

208,0.8936675786972046,1253.0,1274.6," What's the work that needs to be secured, his primarily design and planning work, some of the ads and the proposed budget are for conceptual design which gets a project to the point where you could potentially pursue Federal grant sources and also have a more more firmly established cost estimate.",,,
209,0.8080962300300598,1278.5,1278.9," so, you",,,
210,0.8230412602424622,1282.0,1291.9," The design of the project will determine where the funding will be pursued, not necessarily.",,,
211,0.8230412602424622,1292.2,1305.0,I think I'm not that they're probably a host of factors that go into what Grant sources are likely to fund any particular project by depends on where those Grant sources are coming from.,,,

217,0.8594995141029358,1330.8,1337.4,I thought there was more of a coupling of moving forward with that plan.,,,
218,0.8594995141029358,1337.9,1344.7,And the budget that the revenue is attached to here.,,,

231,0.9060360193252563,1409.0,1414.5,"So while I can't speak to the South Lake Union Street Car, although we can look into that.",,,
232,0.9060360193252563,1414.6,1420.3,It is not uncommon for the city to study a project design.,,,
233,0.9060360193252563,1420.3,1428.5,"A project before the complete funding picture is together, because without that design, you're not in the queue to be",,,
234,0.896645724773407,1428.7,1432.3, Eligible for those fate state and federal dollars.,,,
235,0.896645724773407,1432.3,1449.1,"So there are there are plenty of examples where we have embarked on a major project without having the entire funding secure and some recent examples, for example, or the South Park Bridge, we made a commitment to provide funding to King County for that project.",,,

239,0.8765995502471924,1466.5,1470.3,So I would I would describe this as in that in that space.,,,

241,0.8765995502471924,1472.1,1473.1,It's a chicken and egg problem.,,,

245,0.8765995502471924,1485.7,1488.5,"But it begs the question then is, how do we devoting",,,
246,0.8721904158592224,1488.7,1491.2, Energy to certain designs and not others.,,,
247,0.8721904158592224,1491.7,1500.2,"So, if we're going forward with a lot of design work when I want area and then we're out searching for Revenue sources for that particular design.",,,
248,0.8721904158592224,1500.4,1505.2,How does that impact the other alternative modes that we might be looking at?,,,
249,0.8721904158592224,1505.2,1517.5,"So the other explanation I've heard in earlier conversations, is that in addition to grant funding Sound Transit, 3 is expected to include some funding of",,,

331,0.9128382802009583,2062.1,2065.2,"So, I guess the question would be, why would",,,
332,0.7226706147193909,2065.4,2068.5, Be spending pedestrian Improvement funds.,,,
333,0.7226706147193909,2068.5,2073.9,"Now, for something that won't be built until they think that's a policy choices.",,,
334,0.7226706147193909,2073.9,2083.6,"I think is, has been alluded in some of the other conversations, trying to plan for a ten million dollar commitment requires looking at a number of different funding sources.",,,
335,0.7226706147193909,2083.6,2088.7,"And in essence, if you will banking some of those funds so that you reach that goal.",,,
336,0.7226706147193909,2088.7,2091.4,So I think it's a policy question on the timing.,,,

338,0.9128385782241821,2098.1,2098.5, Go ahead.,,,

340,0.9128385782241821,2100.3,2100.7,So,,,
341,0.8385594487190247,2102.4,2114.4," Yeah, just to comment on that because The Pedestrian bicycle pedestrian bridge is a partnership that is everybody is being asked to make a commitment because there are four different agencies are attributing to that.",,,
342,0.8385594487190247,2114.6,2119.7,So that might be one factor to take into account and I don't know how what the timing necessarily has to be.,,,

345,0.7378652691841125,2136.8,2138.6,Half of it is carry forward.,,,

347,0.7378652691841125,2145.5,2149.8,"And so, rule of thumb, would be to design 10 blocks.",,,
348,0.7378652691841125,2149.8,2151.8,You need about 1 point for that.,,,
349,0.8110327124595642,2152.2,2157.9, What s dot has told us that the cost per sidewalk is a hundred and forty thousand dollars.,,,
350,0.8110327124595642,2157.9,2167.6,"So if you spent all your design, assuming you were still working with the 2.5, that's that's on this item right now if you wanted to design, but let's say 18 blocks of new sidewalk.",,,
351,0.8110327124595642,2167.6,2169.4,Since it's not a direct doubling.,,,
352,0.8110327124595642,2170.0,2181.8,"The only question would be, then whether you have reached money, dedicated taken from someplace else in 2015, if you were going to try to construct all 18 blocks in 2015, like, if I, if I want to produce more sidewalks,",,,
353,0.9053749442100525,2182.0,2187.3, how do I design more of them this year and also have the pipeline capacity to build them in the following year?,,,
354,0.7519900798797607,2188.8,2199.4, There's always that trade-off according to s dot the total cost for construction of the 10 sidewalks would be over four million dollars for that.,,,
355,0.7519900798797607,2199.4,2206.9,"So, four million for the construction of the 1.1 is just carried over and sort of as part as a contribution toward that that for other funding 20.",,,
356,0.7519900798797607,2206.9,2207.4,Right?,,,

440,0.8849417567253113,2790.8,2793.9,And how many of those would have been increased in rates?,,,
441,0.8849417567253113,2793.9,2799.8,Or how many had seen decreased would see decreases in rates about three-quarters of them?,,,

452,0.9077909588813782,2853.0,2855.0,I will also point out that the data,,,
453,0.8089706897735596,2855.2,2865.0," Also suggests that there are neighborhoods that suggest based on the data that they would move into the evening parking rate category, the 628 period.",,,
454,0.8089706897735596,2865.0,2870.3,"So for consistency sake, if we're going to adjust, we would want to, we would want to look at all of these.",,,
455,0.8089706897735596,2870.3,2871.9,What we have learned.,,,
456,0.8089706897735596,2871.9,2885.0,"And I think the council has learned as well, is that parking rates inspire a lot of opinions and Community input and the icy councilmember common law?",,,
457,0.8969669938087463,2885.1,2885.6, Laughing over there.,,,
458,0.8969669938087463,2885.6,2888.9,"Yes, that might be slightly understated.",,,
459,0.8969669938087463,2888.9,2903.1,"But anyway, I felt like this go around that the city as a whole would benefit from imput in a dialogue with the affected neighbors neighborhoods before we actually implement the changes.",,,
460,0.8969669938087463,2903.1,2915.1,"So thought we would take some time, use the parking sounding board that has been helpful in the past to talk through these, these rate changes get their input on on how to roll out the changes.",,,
461,0.8988233208656311,2915.5,2922.8," And then work with the Council on, developing that plan, and we did not feel that we had sufficient time to do that.",,,
462,0.8988233208656311,2922.8,2944.2,"Now as part of the budget process, so wanted to wait and do that in the first quarter of 2014, the other change that is going on in this is a little bit jumping ahead in the staff report is that in order to get more finite and Nuance time of day parking?",,,
463,0.8988233208656311,2944.5,2945.0,We,,,
464,0.8595547676086426,2945.1,2959.5," Need new meters that have the ability for more Dynamic adjustments, in the meter rates and as you will see, later in the staff report, there is money in the budget to start replacing those and wanted to sync that up as well.",,,
465,0.8595547676086426,2959.5,2966.7,"So that is some of the executive thinking, of course, this is councils, turn to weigh in, but that's, that's a little bit of a flavor.",,,
466,0.8595547676086426,2967.1,2967.8,Thank you.,,,
467,0.8595547676086426,2967.8,2968.4,I appreciate that.,,,
468,0.8595547676086426,2968.9,2969.4,I would think that,,,
469,0.8167706727981567,2970.4,2979.4," If all of that is a good assessment of the mayor's thinking, he would want to apply the policy in the majority of the neighborhoods where we'd actually be decreasing.",,,
470,0.8167706727981567,2979.4,2991.1,"The parking rates, which I don't think too many people would complain about that except maybe the budget office and maybe hold off on the others but he's made the recommendation he's made.",,,
471,0.8167706727981567,2991.1,3000.2,"Yeah, and I would say that the opinion of the budget office in this is it's more looking more",,,
472,0.8138638734817505,3000.4,3005.7," Historically, this was not a yes anyways comes remember God and had a question.",,,
473,0.8138638734817505,3006.3,3009.9,Just wanted to inquire when you talk to a neighborhood.,,,
474,0.8138638734817505,3010.8,3015.3,Do we talk to the business Community to we talk to the residents?,,,
475,0.8138638734817505,3015.3,3016.5,Who are we talking to?,,,
476,0.8138638734817505,3016.5,3021.1,We talk to a neighborhood about whether their rates should go up or down.,,,
477,0.7572795152664185,3023.5,3024.6, Do you want me to take this one?,,,
478,0.7572795152664185,3024.6,3025.1,Yes it's well.,,,
479,0.7572795152664185,3025.1,3052.0,"Okay, so the parking sounding board represents a number of Representatives throughout the community including businesses and residents so it's it's not neighborhood focused in particular, it is a group that includes members from a cross-section throughout the city, but we would want to do Outreach and this has happened in the past with the effective business districts most.",,,
480,0.7572795152664185,3052.0,3053.2,So we really not talk.,,,
481,0.8696303367614746,3053.4,3056.4, To neighborhoods were talking to a parking sounding board.,,,
482,0.8696303367614746,3056.4,3061.6,Is that the case the parking sounding board has been in place for several years.,,,

484,0.8696303367614746,3070.0,3071.6,It's like an Advisory Board.,,,
485,0.8696303367614746,3071.6,3076.0,Similar to what we have with other policy areas in the city council member God.,,,
486,0.8696303367614746,3076.0,3082.8,"And if I may, I think part of the thinking that Counsel had when adopted,",,,

489,0.7780813574790955,3100.8,3105.1,And look more at how are people behaving?,,,

492,0.7780813574790955,3112.1,3112.5,And then,,,
493,0.8047531247138977,3113.3,3120.9, Making us sort of a just a data-based response to the rates and if there are a lot of people parking the rates go up.,,,

496,0.7757015228271484,3143.3,3147.7, Cult to apply a single rate in that neighborhood.,,,
497,0.7757015228271484,3148.3,3161.1,"So those are primarily the areas that I think you still have to work with the existing technology, you do still have to take into consideration, other factors including input from the community council member of Brian.",,,

501,0.8675119876861572,3167.2,3174.7,I think that the I think it's important that as we move forward that we're not seeing is backsliding from the policy.,,,
502,0.8675119876861572,3175.2,3184.3,"I think we did a lot of work on that policy and I still support the policy and so as we move forward, the nuances that you discussed I think are important.",,,

505,0.7121668457984924,3199.8,3207.8,"And so depending on the timing of that, I think, I think we may want to, you know, continue with the existing policy, but use that to refine it.",,,
506,0.7121668457984924,3208.0,3220.1,"The other area, I'm interested in, maybe getting some more information is around our data collection and we won't get that here, but try and understand the surveys were doing.",,,

545,0.8616791367530823,3500.7,3511.2,"Okay, a question from yes, did such a few indicate that some of the existing inventories is around 10 years old than of 2014.",,,
546,0.8616791367530823,3511.6,3512.8,What are some of the newer?,,,
547,0.8041378855705261,3514.6,3517.2," Inventory, or do we have something that's only like two years old?",,,
548,0.8041378855705261,3517.2,3518.1,Three years old?,,,
549,0.8041378855705261,3518.3,3527.8,"I don't think we have any that are quite that young, but they the pay stations were acquired from 2004 through.",,,
550,0.8041378855705261,3527.8,3534.2,"I think 2007 was the last maybe two thousand eight, I can check on that and confirm",,,
551,0.9128382205963135,3535.6,3540.6," So you describe the new pay stations as being Nimble, what does that mean?",,,
552,0.9128382205963135,3540.6,3547.8,They can be controlled electronically wirelessly with rather than manually or what does that mean?,,,
553,0.9128382205963135,3547.8,3564.9,Yes s dot indicates that first their capabilities are such that different times of day can be set to charge different amounts so they may charge only a dollar in the morning but 350 or four dollars in the evening.,,,
554,0.9128382205963135,3565.0,3565.2,If,,,

556,0.8803113102912903,3573.6,3578.6,In order to meet the target occupancy for every hour throughout the day.,,,
557,0.8803113102912903,3579.5,3584.3,Also the older pay station this require manual.,,,
558,0.8803113102912903,3584.3,3594.2,Check to when they push out a single new rate which is all that the pay stations today are capable of at least with good customer service.,,,
559,0.8537821173667908,3595.9,3604.1, They need to send someone out to make sure that the push of that information registered properly on the existing technology.,,,
560,0.8537821173667908,3604.2,3609.6,"And I think that would be a cost, which would no longer be required with a new technology.",,,
561,0.8537821173667908,3609.6,3616.5,"I guess the advantage of that is then neither the council, nor the mayor would have to make decision with regard to the parking meter rates.",,,
562,0.8537821173667908,3616.5,3618.3,"We just blame it on the machine, right?",,,
563,0.7931952476501465,3622.0,3626.6, Machine finish the parking meter.,,,
564,0.7917510271072388,3628.2,3633.1, She so I never have and I think we're ready to move on to the next issue.,,,
565,0.7917510271072388,3633.2,3639.3,"I just wanted to jump in again, I want to reinforce what councilmember O'Brien said a few moments ago.",,,
566,0.7917510271072388,3639.3,3657.7,"I I think the policy that the council adopted several years ago was really wise and it was a significant one, it shifted us away from a revenue orientation on parking to a market demand driven basis and",,,
567,0.8991665244102478,3658.0,3660.0, I do still support that policy.,,,
568,0.8991665244102478,3660.0,3668.5,"I think what's been frustrating knowing that it's a new policy and it's going to take time to work out the details, the policies really clear?",,,
569,0.8991665244102478,3668.5,3671.3,There's no ambiguity there.,,,
570,0.8991665244102478,3671.3,3686.5,"So it's been frustrating that we're going to go now for a couple of years without fulfilling the promise, that's in that policy, which is we will adjust rates when the occupancy shows, they should either be reduced.",,,
571,0.8991665244102478,3686.5,3687.9,And that certainly,,,
572,0.912838339805603,3688.0,3704.6," What the latest study showed that they should be reduced in many neighborhoods and in some neighborhoods, maybe even taken away entirely and in a few neighborhoods increased a bit, so that we are regulating, what's happening on the street and making it more.",,,
573,0.9128382205963135,3706.7,3712.7, Easy for people to find an open space when they go to our neighborhood business districts.,,,
574,0.9128382205963135,3713.2,3717.2,So I hope s dot doesn't interpret anything.,,,
575,0.9128382205963135,3717.2,3726.4,"We do as wanting to deviate from the policy unless we vote to change the policy, which I haven't heard anybody suggest.",,,
576,0.9128382205963135,3726.4,3734.2,So the policy is what it is and I wish that it had been managed more appropriately to that policy.,,,
577,0.7750434875488281,3735.1,3736.7," Yes, I agree with that.",,,
578,0.7750434875488281,3736.7,3737.6,I don't,,,
579,0.7411776185035706,3738.9,3743.5, Know what possible changes to the code has taught us thinking over the mirrors thinking of.,,,

581,0.7411776185035706,3747.5,3748.5,And it seems as though.,,,
582,0.7411776185035706,3749.0,3757.1,"What else taught in, perhaps Ameristar struggling with his, how to implement it, I can I jump in.",,,
583,0.7411776185035706,3757.3,3762.9,So I don't think anyone is is suggesting that we back away from the policy either.,,,
584,0.7411776185035706,3763.2,3768.5,What we are suggesting and what we have learned through the past particularly the,,,
585,0.8447151780128479,3768.6,3775.1, Creases is that there is benefit to taking time to reaching out to the community and that's that's all that we are.,,,
586,0.8447151780128479,3775.1,3795.7,"Suggesting in this budget, we fully expect to come back in the first quarter next year with with changes to, to adhere to the policy, but want to build in time to do that Outreach and seek that input, and obviously, the council can decide to do with that what they want.",,,
587,0.8447151780128479,3795.7,3798.4,"But that that's, that's the position that were representing.",,,
588,0.8691012263298035,3798.5,3800.9, We're not backing away from the policies themselves.,,,
589,0.7128560543060303,3802.6,3820.9," I said a specific question again on the capital money for the new pay stations, the serve a poly discussion or now but the 1.3 million for 2014 is that sort of a pro rata share for 2014 toward the 25 million dollar, Capital purchase, is that what the 1.3 represents?",,,
590,0.7128560543060303,3821.5,3825.5,So my understanding is that the CIP assumes a seven year.,,,
591,0.7128560543060303,3825.5,3826.1,Lease.,,,
592,0.7128560543060303,3826.2,3830.7,"Not a purchase of the of 2,200 new pay stations.",,,
593,0.7128560543060303,3831.0,3831.5,So,,,
594,0.8958989381790161,3831.8,3851.3, 600 pay stations out of 2200 would begin a 7 year lease in sometime in 2014 and 1.3 million would be the first years installation and lease payments for those 608th leasing is always the route cities go as opposed to purchasing pay stations.,,,
595,0.8958989381790161,3851.5,3853.4,"No, I don't think that's the case in the past.",,,
596,0.8958989381790161,3853.4,3861.6,We purchased the pay stations and s dot has not determined whether we would again purchase or instead.,,,
597,0.9122863411903381,3861.8,3863.6, Enter a multi-year lease.,,,
598,0.9122863411903381,3864.6,3870.4,The request sort of the responses to the request for proposal that I mentioned earlier.,,,
599,0.9122863411903381,3870.4,3875.2,I think include both options and they will evaluate the responses and determine what to do.,,,
600,0.9122863411903381,3875.2,3879.4,And currently we have different types of pay stations all over the city.,,,
601,0.9122863411903381,3879.5,3889.1,"Some older, some newer, I don't know how many versions of pay stations are out there, but this proposal assumes the same type spread out throughout the entire city.",,,
602,0.9122863411903381,3889.4,3890.9,"That's, that's my understanding.",,,
603,0.8877274990081787,3891.9,3892.4, 11.,,,
604,0.8877274990081787,3892.7,3901.5,"If I can maybe add to that, we have seen recently changes in parking technology.",,,
605,0.8877274990081787,3901.5,3917.5,Both both more Nimble to quote staff report or ability to apply more Dynamic pricing time of day pricing but also we've seen and we've spent a lot of time talking about this as well pay by cell.,,,
606,0.8877274990081787,3917.5,3921.7,So we are we're at a period of time where this technology is,,,
607,0.8042480945587158,3921.8,3922.9, Changing very quickly.,,,
608,0.8042480945587158,3922.9,3933.5,"So in the past, we have gone, the capital route because the lifespan of the technology has been such that it's lasted for a period of time.",,,
609,0.8042480945587158,3933.5,3939.9,"That that justifies that with the changing technology, we may be in a situation in.",,,
610,0.8042480945587158,3939.9,3941.4,This is what will be evaluated.,,,
611,0.8042480945587158,3941.4,3951.7,"As part of the RFP process, it, we may be at a time where the technology is changing so quickly, that it makes more financial sense, in terms of matching,",,,
612,0.8695496320724487,3951.9,3962.9," The investment with the, the longevity of of the capital item to go down the lease past path and that is, what will be evaluated during this RFP process.",,,
613,0.8695496320724487,3963.0,3974.3,That's why I'm finished and because you have the plan seems to include a plan to replace the 2200 over a three-year period yet the CIP assumes a 7 year lease.,,,
614,0.7665739059448242,3976.0,3979.3, Totaling that would totally be a total cost of 30 million.,,,
615,0.7665739059448242,3979.3,3990.1,So we have a three year period of replacement 7 year leases we currently have different types of meters all over the city and I and this technology is rapidly changing.,,,
616,0.7665739059448242,3990.1,3998.3,So I was trying to understand was our plan to lockdown the same type universally throughout the city or continue to have different versions throughout the city.,,,
617,0.7665739059448242,3998.9,4005.6,They would be different than the versions that we have now because the technology has advanced,,,
618,0.7621100544929504,4005.9,4031.7," Particularly with more time of day pricing, what I what I can't say and I think, but I think the RFP will shed light on this is, Will everything with this new Arrangement, will every single parking meter in the city, then be the same, not necessarily what we've got, but same, as what is newly installed, I think some of that will depend on how long it takes to go through and replace all of those meters.",,,
619,0.7621100544929504,4031.7,4035.6,But we can we can get you more specific information outside of this.,,,
620,0.801781177520752,4035.8,4036.2, Meeting.,,,
621,0.7777915000915527,4038.9,4061.9," Okay, cuz my brain when just quick follow-up on the policy, I think on the one hand, I think we've been very clear on the policy when we established it but I also recall that at the time, we recognized the limitations that we had both with data capture and the the the M themselves and so well it's pretty clear.",,,
622,0.7777915000915527,4061.9,4067.7,We want to raise the rates when were when were at maximum occupancy and lower the rates when they're low.,,,
623,0.7976510524749756,4067.9,4069.3, Or it's not clear what to do.,,,
624,0.7976510524749756,4069.3,4073.3,When the rates were 100% occupancy in the morning and zero percent occupancy in the afternoon.,,,
625,0.7976510524749756,4073.3,4076.3,"There, we don't have, we didn't spell that out.",,,
626,0.7976510524749756,4076.3,4081.9,"And so I just want to encourage yes, dot to continue to view that policy as guidance.",,,
627,0.7976510524749756,4081.9,4088.3,"And I think as we go forward and have more technological flexibility, we may want to get more specific on the policy.",,,
628,0.7976510524749756,4089.7,4094.5,And I just understand the constraints that estas operating within with the existing technology.,,,
629,0.7976510524749756,4094.5,4097.7,"The other constraint, maybe if I could piggyback on that momentarily,",,,
630,0.9128388166427612,4098.1,4107.7, Is that what were also seeing is that certain neighborhoods you see in the core very high occupancy and you go one or two blocks away lower occupancy.,,,
631,0.9128388166427612,4107.7,4117.4,"Again, the technology does not allow us not only Dynamic time of day pricing, but also those nuances within a particular neighborhood.",,,
632,0.9128388166427612,4117.4,4124.1,"And so that's something again, you know, you could slice and dice the data anyway, you want, depending on how you slice and dice it.",,,
633,0.9128388166427612,4124.1,4127.7,There may be Pockets within a neighborhood where certain areas,,,
634,0.832582950592041,4127.9,4133.6, Is our are actually high in suggest a rate increase and then outlying areas.,,,
635,0.832582950592041,4133.6,4135.9,Maybe suggest either holding steady or a rate.,,,
636,0.832582950592041,4135.9,4140.4,"Decrease, the new technology will allow us to get more nuanced with that question.",,,
637,0.832582950592041,4144.0,4146.6,I'm just looking let's proceed please.,,,
638,0.9032174944877625,4147.9,4155.9," Okay, so councilmembers', the next issue, issue number five is related to S dots.",,,

673,0.7834717631340027,4427.8,4436.4,So for instance Transit corridors that are non arterioles or other High-Tech high volume areas would be where they would emphasize their their road work today.,,,

690,0.9128386378288269,4513.2,4515.0,Or do you think there's a problem of doing this?,,,
691,0.9128386378288269,4515.0,4516.8,Because it's not at a sustainable level.,,,
692,0.8912050127983093,4517.7,4518.7, Council right.,,,

714,0.8408303260803223,4643.6,4652.7,Construction would get started in Spring of 2014 and there's funding included in the budget to that end Phase 2.,,,

723,0.8321061134338379,4728.7,4729.0,Okay?,,,
724,0.8321061134338379,4730.3,4730.6,So,,,
725,0.8165586590766907,4730.7,4732.6, I want to return to the phases.,,,

742,0.8333533406257629,4855.8,4865.0,There are could be used for any Capital project in S.C IP they are 2011 bond funds and Levy lid lifts funds.,,,
743,0.8333533406257629,4867.4,4879.7,"And I just highlight here that the Mercer West project has a 30 point, six million dollar inter fund loan, which is to be repaid with future sale of property in the South Lake Union area.",,,

746,0.8865824937820435,4886.9,4894.8,So I just highlight that as an example of one of the other things that the city might decide to do with any savings from Mercer East.,,,
747,0.8088293671607971,4896.8,4901.4," Is that the, excuse me, the full cost of Mercer West 30, no, Mercer.",,,
748,0.8088293671607971,4901.4,4903.9,West is on the order of 95 million dollars.,,,
749,0.8088293671607971,4903.9,4904.3,Okay.,,,
750,0.8088293671607971,4904.9,4911.3,But there's a about a third of that funding comes from an interfund loan to be repaid with potential of surplus property.,,,
751,0.8088293671607971,4911.5,4911.8,Okay?,,,
752,0.8088293671607971,4911.8,4915.5,I'm curious about the funding for phase 3.,,,
753,0.8088293671607971,4915.5,4916.7,How did it come about that?,,,
754,0.8088293671607971,4916.7,4921.8,That is fully funded even though phase two is critical.,,,
755,0.8088293671607971,4922.3,4926.4,My understanding is that the city received a grant and the grant,,,
756,0.6941896677017212,4926.8,4940.2, Had some specific ties to the kind of work that's being done at the north end but slightly different work that's being at the south end and it's at any rate it's particular for the North and work is it related to the 520 bridge?,,,
757,0.6941896677017212,4940.2,4941.1,Is that why?,,,
758,0.6941896677017212,4941.6,4950.4,I don't believe so no the phase three is about an eight million dollar chunk of the 46 million dollar total project budget.,,,
759,0.6941896677017212,4950.7,4956.3,There's four million dollars in Grant funds that have been secured if the city didn't want to.,,,

761,0.762687087059021,4958.3,4960.7,There are four million dollars of match dollars.,,,
762,0.762687087059021,4960.7,4965.1,That could be moved to the phase to fund a portion of the phase 2 hole.,,,
763,0.7866368889808655,4968.4,4975.3, Any questions about the 23rd Avenue Corridor project in a very major project expensive councilmember Brian?,,,
764,0.7866368889808655,4975.3,4977.0,I think was first and then customer comment.,,,
765,0.7866368889808655,4977.4,4984.1,Just a quick question on how we strategically want to deal with some of these gaps.,,,
766,0.7866368889808655,4984.1,4993.3,"So if I heard you correctly, the Mercer West has a plug in there for potential revenue from sale of surplus property.",,,
767,0.8413537740707397,4994.5,4997.3, And we don't know if mr.,,,
768,0.8413537740707397,4997.3,5004.4,West is going to come in on over under budget yet because that's still under process and we also don't know what the revenue will be from sales of surplus property.,,,
769,0.8413537740707397,5004.4,5005.6,"Yeah, that's roughly correct.",,,
770,0.8413537740707397,5005.6,5011.0,"But there isn't the plan is to fund, Mercer West with an interfund alone that much is known.",,,
771,0.8413537740707397,5011.1,5017.4,"So, there's definitely, I think, the loan may already be at least in part under way, if not entirely under way.",,,
772,0.8413537740707397,5017.4,5022.4,"Because construction, I think finishes up in the next year or so, the",,,
773,0.9128382802009583,5024.3,5029.6, One is to repay that loan with future sale of surplus property or some other means.,,,
774,0.9128382802009583,5029.6,5042.3,"But right now the understanding is, there is a large parcel where broad is being vacated eventually on the east side of 99, right?",,,
775,0.9128382802009583,5042.6,5046.3,That would be sufficient to repay that inner funnel.,,,
776,0.9128382802009583,5046.3,5052.7,All the proceeds from that potential future sale are expected to be sufficient to repay the loan.,,,

778,0.8402755260467529,5054.2,5056.0, has to come up with some other funding source.,,,
779,0.8402755260467529,5056.0,5061.1,"Or if the city decides not to sell that property for whatever reason, the city still has to repay itself.",,,
780,0.8402755260467529,5061.3,5065.5,"The interfund loan amount, including principal and interest, okay?",,,
781,0.8402755260467529,5065.5,5071.5,"So in we, if we have some savings from Mercer East, let's just use the 10 million dollar number four.",,,
782,0.8402755260467529,5071.5,5075.3,Now whether we leave that there until mr.,,,
783,0.8402755260467529,5075.3,5082.9,West is complete in that issue is resolved or transfer to 23rd to fill that hole and potentially have a whole immerser West.,,,
784,0.9128393530845642,5084.3,5089.0," You know, one way or the other, we're going to assume do both these projects and find a way to pay for them.",,,
785,0.9128393530845642,5089.1,5092.3,"Is there a, is there a policy decision there?",,,
786,0.9128393530845642,5092.3,5093.4,And how we'd want to apply it?,,,
787,0.9128393530845642,5093.4,5099.1,"Or is it more of just a prioritization of supposed to which project is more important mean, Mercer West is clearly going forward.",,,
788,0.9128393530845642,5099.1,5103.6,So that's going to finish I would say it's primarily a policy call.,,,
789,0.9128393530845642,5104.4,5109.2,"We know that some of the funding from Mercer East is 2011, bonds.",,,
790,0.9128393530845642,5109.2,5113.6,And I know that Council has expressed an interest in making sure that the the,,,
791,0.9097813367843628,5113.8,5115.4, And bonds or spent down.,,,
792,0.9097813367843628,5115.8,5119.5,So the fastest way to spend that money might be on Mercer West.,,,
793,0.9097813367843628,5119.5,5122.7,"But either way, I think you've articulated exactly right.",,,
794,0.9097813367843628,5122.8,5132.2,"Both of those holes would have to be filled, either through a reprioritization of other Transportation spending or through additional bonding.",,,
795,0.9097813367843628,5133.8,5143.6,"So and and I think your, your, your description of it being a part of Sation is, is very appropriate, and the city does have",,,
796,0.7873343825340271,5143.7,5148.7, Have a practice a past practice of where things are priorities.,,,
797,0.7873343825340271,5149.1,5156.6,"You know, you find the money to get you to a certain point and then there is an aspect of it that we figure out in the years later.",,,
798,0.7873343825340271,5156.6,5161.7,And a good example of this is actually not a transportation project although there are examples there.,,,
799,0.7873343825340271,5161.7,5169.6,"But the Rainier Beach Community, Center was a project that was a priority to the city funding was allocated in 2009.",,,
800,0.7873343825340271,5169.6,5173.6,I believe it was 4.5 million dollars but 20 million of that.,,,
801,0.8192427158355713,5173.7,5177.6, That was designated as funding to be determined.,,,
802,0.8192427158355713,5178.3,5183.5,And that was something that we figured out ultimately as part of the 2011 budget process.,,,
803,0.8192427158355713,5183.5,5187.1,"So where, where there are priorities?",,,
804,0.8192427158355713,5187.1,5197.5,"We, you know, we do figure out the funding sources, I think Dan's comments about taking advantage of grant opportunities is another thing where you know you don't want to lose those opportunities.",,,
