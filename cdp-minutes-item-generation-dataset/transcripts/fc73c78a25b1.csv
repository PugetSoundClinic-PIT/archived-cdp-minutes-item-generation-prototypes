42,0.97,290.056,292.025,I will start with an update on budget and revenue.,19,,
43,0.97,292.091,309.075,"In the budget and revenue space, we are in a bit of a low . Most of the major legislation has had its public hearings, however all of these bills are considered necessary to implement the budget.",19,,
44,0.97,309.142,314.347,That means they are not subject to the variety of cutoffs that the Legislature imposes.,19,,
45,0.97,314.414,328.027,"So, while most bills have had to make it out of their committees and face the upcoming deadline, to make it to a floor vote and move out of their House of origin, these bills do not and will continue to be worked on throughout session.",19,,
46,0.97,328.094,350.316,"The big update in the budget and revenue space is that this month, on March 17th, there is the state revenue forecast . This will really frame for legislators and budget leaders exactly what the budget scenario is that they need to work with.",19,,
47,0.97,350.383,357.824,"We have the most recent update, but legislators like to have the most up-to-date information as they are crafting their budgets.",19,,
48,0.97,357.89,369.368,"We have heard Anecdotally, but from folks who are closely connected to the revenue forecast team, we are likely to see an Uptick in state revenues.",19,,
49,0.97,369.435,378.845,"Right now, but talk is that we are looking at somewhere between 500 and $700 million . Obviously that number is subject to change.",19,,
50,0.97,378.911,391.958,"We still have several weeks before we hit March 17th, but that is the current picture . As we mentioned over the summer, as the revenue forecast has continued to improve, that's obviously good for the overall budget picture.",19,,
51,0.97,392.024,397.463,It means that there is a less of a gap that needs to be closed.,19,,
52,0.97,397.53,404.804,"With this latest increase, we'd be looking at a rather small shortfall actually for the upcoming fiscal year.",19,,
53,0.97,404.871,422.789,"However, the double-edged sword is that that does blunt some of the momentum for real progressive revenue reform . that said, there are still a number of legislators who are committed to revenue reform in both chambers.",19,,
54,0.97,422.855,430.363,The focus really seems to be centering in on the capital gains tax.,19,,
55,0.97,430.429,433.9,"The Senate, as we mentioned in our previous updates, past their proposal out of committee.",19,,
56,0.97,433.966,444.076,"We have heard that the Senate is likely to take the first action if they move forward with capital gains, as that has been sort of the bottleneck in the past.",19,,
57,0.97,444.143,454.52,"So, we will be watching that closely and continuing to work with legislators and Stakeholders to support that effort.",19,,
58,0.97,454.587,463.83,I think that is all I have for the budget and revenue space . I will pause for any questions.,19,,

334,0.97,2974.971,2980.177,I wanted to just highlight a couple parts of that statement if you will indulge me.,51,,
335,0.97,2980.243,3019.182,"As I've been talking about regularly in this briefing, homelessness is by far the biggest issue that my office response to on a regular basis . Everyone is frustrated at what appears on the outside to be a lack of willingness from our city to react to the plight faced by Un-Housed people . that's why my staff and I have personally worked with providers like Ghesquiere reach, lead, and Lehigh, to engage with and offer services to our--and shelter to Un- housed neighbors in district 2. that's why we visited neighbors living Un-Housed.",51,,
336,0.97,3019.249,3021.885,We worked with mutual aid groups to get folks much-needed supplies.,51,,
337,0.97,3021.952,3035.432,It's why we worked hard to stand up to homelessness outreach and provider Ecosystem . and why We've advocated for no--more hotel and tiny House funding.,51,,
338,0.97,3035.499,3042.139,"We all know colleagues that as a counselor we are using all of the tools at our disposal, legislation, advocacy, and budget actions.",51,,

342,0.97,3061.091,3063.593,To listen to the recommendations of experts in the field.,51,,
343,0.97,3063.66,3087.818,To leave FEMA funding on the table when the Biden administration has said that reimbursement is possible is frustrating to say the least .

568,0.97,4921.716,4925.287,"So, we got those on last week's introduction and referral calendar.",81,,
569,0.97,4925.353,4949.21,"Members of the transportation and utility Committee, which includes oversight of our information technology Department, could get a head start on reviewing the nine or 10 surveillance impact reports . I recommend starting with the three central staff memos and then going to the shorter executive overview summaries . These two items will provide context before digging into the much larger surveillance impact reports themselves.",81,,
570,0.97,4949.277,4958.953,Lisa K from our city council staff and another person from my staff are available to answer questions before the committee this Wednesday morning.,81,,
571,0.97,4959.02,4961.589,Thank you.,81,,
572,0.97,4961.656,4966.127,"Thank you, Pedersen.",82,,
573,0.97,4966.194,4970.999,"Up next we have Councilmember Sawant, and then I will close it out.",82,,
574,0.97,4971.066,4973.234,"Councilmember Sawant, good morning.",82,,
575,0.97,4973.301,4978.54,"Good morning, Tem Strauss and good morning to everybody.",83,,
576,0.97,4978.606,4985.413,On today's city council agenda there are no items from the Sustainability and Renters rights committee.,83,,
577,0.97,4985.48,4988.983,"The next meeting of the committee is going to be this Thursday, March 4TH, at 9:30 A.M.",83,,
578,0.97,4989.05,5002.097,"In that Committee, we hope that the committee will vote on the right to counsel legislation from my office, which guarantees that any Renter in Seattle facing Eviction has the right to a lawyer.",83,,
579,0.97,5002.163,5025.653,"Regardless of ability to pay . Thank you so much again Councilmember Lewis, not only for Cosponsoring this legislation, but also for speaking in support of it . over the past several years, through efforts from my office in coordination, we have one city level public funding for attorneys to the housing judge this project.",83,,
580,0.97,5025.72,5033.495,The right to Council legislation would commit the city of Seattle to contracting for all the legal representation that would be needed.,83,,
581,0.97,5033.561,5042.303,Such that the attorneys from organizations such as the housing justice project can defend every Renter facing Eviction who needs help.,83,,
582,0.97,5042.37,5051.846,We know from evidence that having an attorney present makes all the difference to tenants facing Eviction.,83,,
583,0.97,5051.913,5071.332,"In previous years, the housing justice project estimated it would cost the city approximately $750,000 per year . This year because of Covid, it is obviously unclear how much legal support will be needed . It will really depend on what happens with the Eviction moratoriums, at least in the immediate next months.",83,,
584,0.97,5071.399,5073.601,At this stage there is no supplemental appropriation required.,83,,
585,0.97,5073.668,5079.04,The fiscal NOTE acknowledges this future uncertainty.,83,,
586,0.97,5079.107,5113.975,"This is exactly why my office has also launched a petition demanding that Mayor Durkan and Governor Inslee immediately renew the Eviction moratoriums for Renters, small businesses, and Nonprofits through 2021. this economic crisis for working people will extend at least to the end of this year and as Seattle and state public health experts have recently reported, the public health crisis, which was the original basis for the Declaration, also will extend at least through the end of 2021, even with the best projections from state health officials on vaccination dissemination.",83,,
587,0.97,5114.042,5130.258,"Back to a right to Council, in our last committee meeting, national experts really did a fantastic job it's planning the right to counsel legislation that exists in other cities . In some cities, the right to Council is guaranteed without any means.",83,,
588,0.97,5130.325,5140.401,This is absolutely crucial as they explained because anytime there is [Indiscernible] it's create significant barriers to people.,83,,
589,0.97,5140.468,5151.179,"Even people who are eligible . We have seen through food stamps, this testing has resulted in a significant chilling effect on people's ability to use it.",83,,
590,0.97,5151.246,5161.923,One extreme example is the CDC Eviction moratorium includes testing requiring Renters to make a declaration of financial hardship.,83,,
591,0.97,5161.99,5170.665,What has happened is in Houston the courts have interpreted that to mean that Renters need a notarized declaration even though notarized is not in the CDC's rules.,83,,
592,0.97,5170.732,5183.011,"As a result, 99% of eligible Renters became disqualified from the Eviction moratorium . Obviously that is a Worst-Case scenario, and in most cases it will not have that kind of sweeping impact.",83,,
593,0.97,5183.077,5199.727,"Statistical studies over many decades show just absolutely statistically overwhelmingly that means testing has a bad effect, not a good effect on people who are eligible for programs receiving those programs.",83,,
594,0.97,5199.794,5209.404,It's also important to note that means testing has the exact opposite effect of those who often advocate for it claim it does.,83,,
595,0.97,5209.47,5217.779,Many times conservative politicians advocate for it because they say it promotes accountability in terms of who gets the benefits.,83,,
596,0.97,5217.845,5220.381,"In other words, making sure well off people don't steal the benefits.",83,,
597,0.97,5220.448,5231.593,"In reality, all that means testing does, even if there are good intentions, all it does is become a serious obstacle to people who are eligible for the programs from receiving the programs.",83,,
598,0.97,5231.659,5236.464,We also saw this in the city utility discount programs as well.,83,,
599,0.97,5236.531,5248.876,"After our movement pushed the then Mayor to make the opt out, the numbers of eligible household who were enrolled shot up.",83,,
600,0.97,5248.943,5256.184,"It really shows that for although statistically Well- established reasons, the route to Council legislation should not contain these.",83,,
601,0.97,5256.25,5261.656,Especially at this time of extreme crisis.,83,,
602,0.97,5261.723,5267.662,I also hope that the right to Council bills will be the first in a series of Renters rights coming this spring from the committee.,83,,
603,0.97,5267.729,5277.105,"In Thursday's committee meeting, we will discuss with a panel of rental and rental rights advocates about those next steps that we hope will come.",83,,
604,0.97,5277.171,5281.976,One key issue is the issue of the false Eviction.,83,,
605,0.97,5282.043,5285.413,Half the Evictions in Seattle are done by default.,83,,
606,0.97,5285.48,5292.52,I mentioned the support in our previous briefings.,83,,
607,0.97,5292.587,5305.5,It means the courts agree to Evict the Renter because they did not show up to the hearing or do the necessary paperwork . This is a huge problem and we will discuss how to address it primarily by getting legal support to the Renters before their default.,83,,
608,0.97,5305.566,5312.24,Also by appealing to the courts to accept the individual of the city funded attorneys wherever possible.,83,,
609,0.97,5312.306,5318.946,"The panel will also discuss the need to extend the Eviction moratorium, which I just mentioned.",83,,
610,0.97,5319.013,5328.923,"If the Mayor and the governor failed to act, it would expire at the end of this month . Finally, the committee will vote on four Reappointments to the Renters Commission.",83,,
611,0.97,5328.99,5341.703,"On Wednesday, Fairbury 24th, the lives of thousands of residents and workers in the Seattle central district in the heart of district 3 were disrupted because of a dangerous underground gas leak and fire.",83,,
612,0.97,5341.769,5349.811,Involving pipes controlled by the four profit corporation Puget sound energy.,83,,
613,0.97,5349.877,5366.694,"Our community owes a deep appreciation to the Union workers of the fire Department firefighters local 27 and from PSE, electrical workers local 77 who responded to this dangerous situation, stopping the leaked gas and putting out the fire.",83,,
614,0.97,5366.761,5372.366,"Once again, front-line workers put themselves in harms way to protect the rest of the community.",83,,
615,0.97,5372.433,5390.651,Councilmembers will have seen the letter from my office to the state utilities and transportation Commission urging them to comprehensively investigate whether and to what degree PSE has neglected maintenance and safety upgrades throughout its entire infrastructure.,83,,
616,0.97,5390.718,5413.007,The gas fire shows yet again the damage for magic profit organizations due to the community and the climate . It is owned by a conglomerate . It seemed to care more about financial returns for their wealthy shareholders than they do for the safety and security of our community.,83,,
617,0.97,5413.074,5425.787,"They are operating gas lines throughout Seattle and the region, burning natural gas and power generators across Washington, and recently voting on a massive liquefied natural gas plant in Tacoma.",83,,
618,0.97,5425.853,5436.964,"In 2016, an explosion leveled a city block in Greenwood injuring nine firefighters, destroying three small businesses, and damaging dozens of buildings.",83,,
619,0.97,5437.031,5451.579,The state utility and transportation committee found that PSE failed to retire an old section of gas pipeline leading to the explosion and find PSE $1.5 million for this neglect.,83,,
620,0.97,5451.646,5459.12,"Given this history, it's not surprising that central district residents have been reaching out to my office with deep concerns about PSE's reliability.",83,,
621,0.97,5459.187,5463.124,Their anxiety is entirely justified.,83,,
622,0.97,5463.191,5497.091,"To share a worker who share their thoughts, quote, for five years I've worked for companies that locate Pse'S underground facilities in Washington State for construction and excavation . The Mac giving system for the power and gas facilities hasn't been updated for over a year, and there are several facilities that are Mismatched, as well as numerous areas where gas services and mains are faulty and not Locatable . given all this, I am not surprised by Wednesday's gas leak and I'm grateful that no one was hurt.",83,,
623,0.97,5497.158,5500.528,"Due to faulty infrastructure, I expect such a Seashell scene in Wednesday's leak are likely to happen again.",83,,
624,0.97,5500.595,5507.235,With more frequency.,83,,
625,0.97,5507.301,5515.943,"I personally look forward to the natural gas systems to be safely Eactivated so that the region can move towards cleaner, more efficient, renewable energy sources . The sooner the better, and safer for all of us.",83,,
626,0.97,5516.01,5517.011,An quote.,83,,
627,0.97,5517.078,5526.02,I really appreciate the worker sharing this information that he had cleaned from his firsthand experience from having worked on these pipelines.,83,,
628,0.97,5526.087,5533.394,"From Texas to Seattle, for profit energy companies like PSE do double damage to our communities.",83,,
629,0.97,5533.461,5539.734,"They maximize profits by cutting corners, causing catastrophic explosions and fires.",83,,
630,0.97,5539.8,5548.876,They rely on fossil fuel like natural gas responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing a climate catastrophe.,83,,
631,0.97,5548.943,5554.782,"Seattle'S electricity is run by a public utility for the benefit of all residents, not for global Profit-Seeking investors.",83,,
632,0.97,5554.849,5570.998,"Is time to take the big energy companies like PSE into Democratic public ownership so that working people can have a say over the impacts that they have on their communities, on our communities and the climate and can Reorient these companies away from gas and back towards clean renewable energies.",83,,

639,0.97,5602.396,5621.749,"I mention that because our committee focuses on utilities . albeit that municipally owned utilities that we are fortunate to have, but I appreciate you sending this letter to PSE and to the Commission actually that overseas Utiities statewide . Thank you.",85,,

652,0.97,5734.395,5743.137,"It's a very narrowly focused bill, so it can seem like it takes on a life of its own when really it's pretty narrowly focused.",86,,
