170,0.97,1094.793,1099.431,"If there's something to do to assist, this is high priority for me.",34,,
171,0.97,1099.431,1100.032,Thank you.,35,,
172,0.97,1100.032,1101.7,I will let you know.,35,,
173,0.97,1101.7,1109.408,Any other bills folks would like to call out?,36,,
174,0.97,1109.408,1114.847,"We asked our director to provide an update on the progressive revenue bill, House bill 2907.",37,,
175,0.97,1114.847,1117.149,I know this is a bill many of us have been tracking.,37,,
176,0.97,1117.149,1120.752,Some action was taken on Friday.,37,,
177,0.97,1120.752,1122.454,Looking forward to having an update on that.,37,,
178,0.97,1122.454,1129.728,"House bill 2907 I know everyone is following closely, was heard on Friday, and passed out of committee.",38,,
179,0.97,1129.728,1131.864,"I believe, it was 8-4. that was moving forward.",38,,
180,0.97,1131.864,1138.27,There was one amendment put forward by representative Orwall that has to do with regional representation on the advisory committee.,38,,
181,0.97,1138.27,1153.819,"There is no Preemption language included in the vehicle that moved forward, so I'm going to ask Robin, who has been our lead on this issue, to fill in Additionalcontext around the bill, and the hearing.",38,,
182,0.97,1164.796,1172.204,"I think the endorsement of the bill was very positive on Friday night, and I think one of the prime sponsors have been communicating we shouldn't make any assumptions by what happened in the committee vote.",39,,
183,0.97,1172.204,1175.207,They felt it was really important to make sure the bill moved on Friday night.,39,,
184,0.97,1175.207,1180.512,"Now, representative Macri, and representative Springer, are hosting negotiations around the bill.",39,,
185,0.97,1180.512,1189.221,I believe that's going to begin with talking to the business community early this week.,39,,
186,0.97,1189.221,1190.622,But a question about the amendment.,39,,
187,0.97,1190.622,1192.291,"This morning, I didn't see an amendment posted Online.",39,,
188,0.97,1192.291,1193.892,It didn't say substitute bill.,39,,
189,0.97,1193.892,1196.728,"Was that amendment,?",39,,
190,0.97,1196.728,1197.329,It was.,40,,
191,0.97,1197.329,1199.998,I am happy to send it to you.,40,,
192,0.97,1199.998,1201.033,Sorry for the confusion.,41,,
193,0.97,1201.033,1210.943,"I thought the bill was introduced as amended, but really, the Orwall amendment is adding one additional representative to where?",41,,
194,0.97,1210.943,1226.191,To an advisory committee that would be in charge of looking at how the money is spent in the accountability committee.,42,,
195,0.97,1226.191,1226.625,No changes.,43,,

199,0.97,1237.302,1238.203,I will have several questions.,46,,
200,0.97,1238.203,1240.038,I will ask them and then let you respond.,46,,
201,0.97,1240.038,1249.781,"You mentioned the prime sponsors, including to start negotiations, and meet with the business community.",46,,
202,0.97,1249.781,1253.285,It's extremely concerning to me that I am not hearing anything about them meeting with ordinary people.,46,,
203,0.97,1253.285,1255.687,This is the Preemption language.,46,,
204,0.97,1255.687,1257.623,This came up from the state legislators.,46,,
205,0.97,1257.623,1259.124,They have left the door open to this.,46,,
206,0.97,1259.124,1278.01,"To your knowledge, what efforts are they making to engage with the hundreds of people who are actively fighting right now, to text but business at the city level, and the thousands of people that support doing that at the city level?",46,,
207,0.97,1278.01,1290.188,"I think we can safely say again, most people, even if they don't fall exactly in a given category, would prefer that the city has the ability to raise taxation.",46,,
208,0.97,1290.188,1299.131,"I want to make clear, the problematic aspect is not the progressive revenues.",46,,
209,0.97,1299.131,1300.532,We also have support for Progressive revenues.,46,,
210,0.97,1300.532,1301.4,That is not the point.,46,,
211,0.97,1301.4,1303.602,The point is looming Preemption.,46,,
212,0.97,1303.602,1316.081,"I want to know how much they are engaging, if at all with just regular people on the ground, and then Secondly, if you could run over some of the deadlines.",46,,
213,0.97,1316.081,1326.692,It's very hard to keep track of what happens at the state Legislature.,46,,
214,0.97,1326.692,1327.993,What are the upcoming House committee votes?,46,,
215,0.97,1327.993,1331.029,"What are the House floor votes, Senate floor votes, reconciliation.",46,,
216,0.97,1331.029,1335.267,"In your mind, what are the dates that we should be aware of, as we go forward?",46,,
217,0.97,1335.267,1346.478,"I think we all know, any of us who has looked at the way the state Legislature functions, this Iteration of the bill does not have Preemption.",46,,
218,0.97,1346.478,1347.546,At a future Iteration could.,46,,
219,0.97,1347.546,1350.849,What are the dates we should keep in mind?,46,,
220,0.97,1350.849,1367.165,"And, also, if you could wait in a little bit on what various legislators are saying, progressive legislators are saying on Preemption.",46,,
221,0.97,1367.165,1368.433,"Unfortunately, this is from a Crosscut article.",46,,
222,0.97,1368.433,1375.707,I am quoting from the article that says Macri didn't rule out leading with later Iterations.,46,,
223,0.97,1375.707,1383.281,I would seek to avoid where businesses could be double taxed.,46,,
224,0.97,1383.281,1386.118,We have the most Regressive tax system.,46,,
225,0.97,1386.118,1391.323,"I don't think right now, there is any concept of double.",46,,
226,0.97,1391.323,1394.092,What would that mean when they are not being taxed hardly at all?,46,,
227,0.97,1394.092,1403.335,I am no Senator Joe Nguyen has spoken to this.,46,,
228,0.97,1403.335,1404.302,Maybe others.,46,,
229,0.97,1404.302,1428.727,"I know housing advocates had a lobby day in Olympia, I believe the same day as the hearing on this legislation, and we are Prioritizing the progressive revenue as a priority for them, particularly the focus on housing, your hope, and reinforcing the importance of the immediacy of that problem.",47,,
230,0.97,1428.727,1439.504,"In terms of individual legislator conversations with other folks, I think we are happy to follow up on that from you.",47,,
231,0.97,1439.504,1453.285,"The next big hurdle to keep in mind is the House of origin fiscal committee cut off, so that is Tuesday, and then we have the House of origin floor cut off and it has to pass the house on the 19th.",47,,
232,0.97,1453.285,1454.886,That would be the next most immediate.,47,,
233,0.97,1454.886,1462.861,"Wind bills that are in the fiscal committees have to pass out, and then off the floor of the House of origin by the 19th.",47,,

235,0.97,1468.5,1483.248,One of the notices I saw included in the Bolton was the date that the front here.,48,,
236,0.97,1487.152,1489.421,"This is a new addition, if I'm correct, from last year.",48,,
237,0.97,1489.421,1490.789,I don't remember seeing those upcoming dates.,48,,
238,0.97,1490.789,1493.725,"That's helpful, but the point is still well taken about when individual bills get scheduled.",48,,
239,0.97,1493.725,1497.596,"That is somewhat of a frustration, I know because those hearing dates don't come out until the week before.",48,,
240,0.97,1497.596,1502.634,"I know that, as you understand this is a bill of interest to us as those hearing dates possibly come up on the announcements.",48,,
241,0.97,1502.634,1508.139,"I think it's Wednesday night or Wednesday morning, let us know when those bills come up.",48,,
242,0.97,1508.139,1516.047,"That's true for any of the bills you all are tracking, including ban the box and other civil rights issues.",48,,

244,0.97,1516.448,1539.037,"As you have individually flagged priorities for your respective offices, we want to provide the most current updates as possible, so I think many of you received a Friday night call from various members of our team just to let you know, given how high a priority we know progressive revenue is.",49,,

247,0.97,1554.686,1556.721,We will make sure to keep everyone updated on Council.,49,,
248,0.97,1556.721,1561.426,"One additional, procedural update is the Senate bill will not be moving forward, so it's only the House bill that's the vehicle.",50,,

250,0.97,1563.395,1563.795,Yes.,52,,
251,0.97,1563.795,1565.597,"The cutoff has passed, and it did not move.",52,,

253,0.97,1570.402,1576.608,Councilmember Lewis.,53,,
254,0.97,1576.608,1578.543,This is more of a going forward question.,54,,
255,0.97,1578.543,1583.348,"First off, I am very encouraged that, regardless of the nature of the negotiations that representative Macri is conducting the negotiations.",54,,
256,0.97,1583.348,1584.816,That gives me a lot of confidence.,54,,

260,0.97,1605.37,1620.051,"I do understand there is going to be in the interest of cities as part of this negotiation, give and take that Macri and representative Springer are going to be hosting.",54,,
261,0.97,1620.051,1631.363,"One of the things that we are probably going to do during the session today is send a letter, expressing the interest of this Council, but we would like to see factored into the negotiations on 2907.",54,,
262,0.97,1631.363,1638.837,"I understand Mayors, and governments all over King County are presenting similar communications, as part of this process.",54,,
263,0.97,1638.837,1667.832,"I just wanted to flag that, in the event that this Council sends this letter, will the office of Intergovernmental relations make plain in these negotiations, that the Seattle city Council has manifested, in this letter that was carefully Crafted by a number of members here, once to see these things Inc., and will that be communicated to inform the negotiations?",54,,
264,0.97,1667.832,1669.467,Robin is our lead on this legislation.,55,,
265,0.97,1669.467,1674.472,We will make sure that your concerns and priorities are related to legislators as negotiations move forward.,55,,
266,0.97,1674.472,1681.78,"Colleagues, I will talk more about the letter we have for you to consider during my update after our friends from Oir finished their presentation.",56,,
267,0.97,1681.78,1685.683,I appreciate you Flogging a number of letters going in.,56,,
268,0.97,1685.683,1694.292,This will be a helpful way to elevate the voice of city municipalities.,56,,
269,0.97,1694.292,1694.793,Councilmember Herbold.,56,,
270,0.97,1694.793,1695.226,Thank you.,57,,
271,0.97,1695.226,1699.297,I know there has been a lot of attention paid to the question Úof Preemption in this bill.,57,,
272,0.97,1699.297,1713.545,"I am wondering, is there any discussion around the question of rate, and whether or not the rate is sufficient to meet our regional needs?",57,,
273,0.97,1713.545,1718.349,I think that's another issue of great importance.,57,,
274,0.97,1718.349,1719.15,To this Council.,57,,
275,0.97,1719.15,1728.76,And should be of great importance to any elected official in this region.,57,,
276,0.97,1728.76,1731.763,"I am just wondering whether or not there are Converstions around that, as well.",57,,
277,0.97,1731.763,1744.576,"Representative Macri has indicated absolutely any and all provisions of this legislation are up for conversation, so I think she wanted to be very clear about that.",58,,
278,0.97,1744.576,1751.349,That's why efforts were made to move the bill as clean as possible out of the Finance Committee as a strong communication to everyone that all points of view are being considered very strongly.,58,,
279,0.97,1751.349,1757.188,And I think those conversations should be informed by the best data that we have about our needs.,59,,
280,0.97,1757.188,1784.682,"As well as information that we have about our existing contribution to affordable housing, both in the city of Seattle, and in King County, and the amount that those dollars can currently leverage, and the amount they could leverage under this new taxation.",59,,
281,0.97,1784.682,1806.371,"I think it's really important to be able to tell the story that this new tax mechanism can hit that goal, but I think we need to flush out a little bit about the contributions we are currently making two affordable housing at the city, and county level, as well as the leverage, and bonding capacity, so we are not just shooting in the dark.",59,,
282,0.97,1806.371,1809.607,Point well taken.,60,,
283,0.97,1809.607,1815.446,"Hopefully, I am uniquely positioned to talk about that given my position at office of housing.",60,,
284,0.97,1815.446,1816.014,Councilmember Sawant.,61,,
285,0.97,1816.014,1816.915,Thank you.,62,,
286,0.97,1816.915,1828.459,"On the point about the amount of revenues that would be generated, I think it is very much tied to the question of Preemption.",62,,
287,0.97,1828.459,1840.471,"We are not in a universe where we are talking about the state, or the county raising all of the requisite revenues, I'm saying let's not have cities to their own thing.",62,,
288,0.97,1840.471,1853.251,"In fact, because this has come up, my staff and I have been looking at a lot of the history of Preemption, how it has been used.",62,,
289,0.97,1853.251,1873.972,"The earlier history of Preemption nationwide, not just Washington state, was a progressive history where civil rights organizers used the concept of Preemption at the state level in a good way, meaning to say that we want to have very minimum standards for civil rights in public spaces, businesses, and so on.",62,,
290,0.97,1873.972,1891.823,And we don't want individual cities that might be more Right- leaning carve out their own standards.,62,,
291,0.97,1891.823,1894.092,"We want to maintain a standard, but that time is long gone.",62,,
292,0.97,1894.092,1896.361,I am happy to send Oir and my colleagues this information.,62,,
293,0.97,1896.361,1914.812,"There's one study from the National employment law project that shows a long history, now the more recent history the last few decades, is actually Preemption being a very standard tool used by the Right- wing, big business, to push back against us to save time, minimum wage, standards, even on municipal Broadband.",62,,
294,0.97,1914.812,1925.556,The review looks at a whole range of things the right wing has used to attack using Preemption.,62,,
295,0.97,1925.556,1951.182,"I think the concern with Preemption is very much tied to the States saying there is the immediacy of a problem, and we have the McKenzie study showing $450 million to go $1 billion every year, based on the current trends and everything.",62,,
296,0.97,1951.182,1952.183,We know it's a moving target.,62,,
297,0.97,1952.183,1957.455,"How is it that, in this context, all we have is a bill that will create authority, which we support, for King County to raise revenues.",62,,
298,0.97,1957.455,1979.043,"The House built itself, it is sort of confusing.",62,,
299,0.97,1979.043,1980.812,The House bill itself does not raise revenues.,62,,
300,0.97,1980.812,1984.082,It creates an authority for King County to raise revenues at the maximum of $121 million.,62,,
301,0.97,1984.082,1985.483,That's the Max King county can do.,62,,
302,0.97,1985.483,1991.422,"We haven't seen whether King County would be willing to do it, but even if the best case scenario happens, that's a fraction of what King County and Seattle needs.",62,,
303,0.97,1991.422,1992.423,I just wanted to flag.,62,,
304,0.97,1992.423,2000.732,"I know others are doing this, as well, but I want to flag how deeply damaging the idea of Preemption would be in the context of a major unprecedented crisis in our society.",62,,
305,0.97,2000.732,2007.038,I don't believe someone can have progressive credentials and then play a role in something so historically damaging.,62,,
306,0.97,2007.038,2012.944,"For full disclosure, I have also communicated with representative Macri, so I'm not saying anything here I have not communicated directly to her.",62,,
307,0.97,2012.944,2020.385,"I am very Aboveboard about all of this, but this is not negotiable.",62,,
308,0.97,2020.385,2028.76,"You cannot leave the door open to Preemption, and say that they progressive thing.",62,,
309,0.97,2028.76,2040.338,"We absolutely need every progressive elected official at every level to say, I will absolutely oppose this, but the prime sponsor has the main responsibility.",62,,
310,0.97,2040.338,2040.738,It's her bill.,62,,
311,0.97,2040.738,2042.774,"Not just her, but her colleagues, whoever is sponsoring it.",62,,
312,0.97,2042.774,2043.374,It's their bill.,62,,
313,0.97,2043.374,2045.476,It's their responsibility to say I do not support this.,62,,
314,0.97,2045.476,2047.945,If I withdraw support from my own bill if it contains Preemption.,62,,
315,0.97,2047.945,2049.313,That needs to be said.,62,,
316,0.97,2049.313,2062.293,"Otherwise, very soon we will see that.",62,,
317,0.97,2062.293,2065.129,I also wanted to flag that the rent control ban was passed in 1981.,62,,
318,0.97,2065.129,2069.7,"40 years later, new generations of us are fighting this still, so if this Preemption happens, I don't think I am exaggerating.",62,,
319,0.97,2069.7,2072.036,"This will stick, and then what will we do about our crisis?",62,,
320,0.97,2093.724,2098.83,I want to be clear to myself that I will have done everything in my power to have prevented this regardless of what anyone else does.,62,,
321,0.97,2098.83,2105.336,"I strongly support the letter that President Mosqueda will be talking about in a few minutes, but I am also bringing a resolution for a vote, as I'm sure you know.",62,,
322,0.97,2105.336,2108.206,"Not that it's relevant to Oir, but I wanted to mention it in that context.",62,,
323,0.97,2108.206,2128.759,"Any additional Councilmembers have comments, or questions for our Oir team?",63,,
324,0.97,2128.759,2128.96,Okay.,63,,
325,0.97,2128.96,2130.728,I really appreciate you providing us with the update.,63,,
326,0.97,2130.728,2134.565,"We know things are moving quickly, and this is a short session, so it's moving even faster than usual.",63,,
327,0.97,2134.565,2139.871,"Thank you for the information, and I know you are probably on your way to Olympia today, so thank you for providing us with these updates.",63,,
328,0.97,2139.871,2144.775,"We are going to leave you with a copy of the letter, as well, and we look forward to having more conversations with you.",63,,
329,0.97,2144.775,2147.178,We appreciate all of the time you are spending down there.,63,,
330,0.97,2147.178,2148.379,I know how hectic it is.,63,,
331,0.97,2148.379,2151.148,I would put my heating pad on my shoulders in the evening to Decompress.,63,,
332,0.97,2151.148,2153.284,Thank you for all of the work you are doing.,63,,
333,0.97,2153.284,2153.684,Thank you.,64,,
334,0.97,2153.684,2157.955,"Council colleagues, for the good of the order, I want to make sure we approve the minutes from last week.",64,,
335,0.97,2157.955,2159.157,Let me go ahead and do that.,64,,
336,0.97,2159.157,2163.06,"If there's no objection, the minutes from the February 3, 2020 meeting of the Council briefing will be adopted.",64,,
337,0.97,2163.06,2164.996,"Hearing no objection, the minutes are adopted.",64,,
338,0.97,2164.996,2166.297,All right.,64,,
339,0.97,2166.297,2169.934,"So, council colleagues, thank you so much for all of the questions you provided to our legislative team.",64,,
340,0.97,2169.934,2173.604,"There are a number of bills moving through from transportation, to housing, to civil rights.",64,,
341,0.97,2173.604,2175.006,The last conversation was just one element.,64,,
342,0.97,2175.006,2175.806,I appreciate our Oir team.,64,,
343,0.97,2175.806,2183.514,"As you have already heard today, there is a letter that I would love for the Council to consider signing onto.",64,,
344,0.97,2183.514,2190.021,"Our called soul colleague Lisa Herbold, at the end of the table, as the official copy to passed on for signature.",64,,
345,0.97,2190.021,2198.396,"Council colleagues, I circulated this letter and asked for your consideration of a letter that would do two things.",64,,
346,0.97,2198.396,2208.739,"One is to be very clear about our ongoing desire to see more additional, progressive revenue tools in this city, this region, and in this state.",64,,
347,0.97,2208.739,2216.047,"Ideally, this would be a state conversation about progressive revenue to right side up our upside down tax system.",64,,
348,0.97,2216.047,2224.956,What House bill 2907 does is add another potential progressive tool to the region by allowing King County to have this authority.,64,,
349,0.97,2224.956,2238.803,"As it stands, you just heard the bill moved out even with this minor amendment that I was not capturing before.",64,,
350,0.97,2239.103,2240.438,It keeps intact the progressive bill as introduced.,64,,
351,0.97,2240.438,2250.381,"I think it's really important for us to be able to weigh in ask Councilmember Lewis suggested, as other cities and municipalities are also weighing in.",64,,
352,0.97,2250.381,2252.583,The voice of Seattle city council should also be heard.,64,,
353,0.97,2252.583,2262.994,"As other entities, like labor, business, and community partners are sending letters Úwith principles, I thought it was important for our principles to be recognized, as well.",64,,
354,0.97,2262.994,2265.997,We know this is the fifth year of the homelessness crisis in our region.,64,,
355,0.97,2265.997,2267.865,We have declared a state of emergency in our city.,64,,
356,0.97,2267.865,2280.011,"This bill, potentially could make significant steps toward bringing in additional revenue, if the state were to pass it, and the county were to act.",64,,
357,0.97,2280.011,2281.479,We could potentially see additional revenue coming in.,64,,
358,0.97,2281.479,2282.78,I don't want to Sugarcoat it.,64,,
359,0.97,2282.78,2289.387,"This is clearly not as much revenue as we talked about, but it is a huge, huge improvement if we are able to get upwards of over $120 million, if not potentially more.",64,,
360,0.97,2289.387,2295.826,What you also see is a desire that we are very clear in our principles that we would like there to be a future conversation about increasing the total revenue authority.,64,,
361,0.97,2295.826,2298.929,That is clearly called out.,64,,
362,0.97,2298.929,2308.105,"As well that the city of Seattle is very concerned, has deep concerns with the Preemption conversation, as articulated today and last Monday.",64,,
363,0.97,2308.105,2313.344,"There is also a desire that we stand on principle, that the majority of funding be directed towards housing.",64,,
364,0.97,2313.344,2314.812,That we use Evidence-Based intervention models.,64,,
365,0.97,2314.812,2331.862,"That includes enhanced shelters, mental health services, but really puts a Frontloaded amount into housing, so there is an exit on the horizon, and Lastly that there is greater clarification for how the regional homeless authority will get funding, compared to the county and the city.",64,,
366,0.97,2331.862,2341.439,"I think more direction on that is helpful, as our central staff has outlined.",64,,
367,0.97,2341.439,2343.574,It's important that we have clarity on that as we go in.,64,,
368,0.97,2343.574,2352.95,These are the pieces that are called out as the principles that the city would like to continue to address.,64,,
369,0.97,2352.95,2354.618,"Lastly, I think it goes without saying.",64,,
370,0.97,2354.618,2360.191,"Much like the state legislative members, our King County Council colleagues, the regional city partners, we here in the city have also been elected to serve our constituents.",64,,
371,0.97,2360.191,2368.599,"In order to do so, we need every tool in our Toolkit.",64,,
372,0.97,2368.599,2370.367,We want to be part of these conversations.,64,,
373,0.97,2370.367,2372.67,We were elected with a duty to respond to those concerns.,64,,
374,0.97,2372.67,2378.409,"It's a request, a desire to be part of those discussions, so they are not just with one focus group, but include the city as the conversation moves forward.",64,,
375,0.97,2378.409,2388.285,"That's my intent with circulating this letter today, and again, I want to underscore my appreciation for the sponsor, sponsors, of the bill.",64,,
376,0.97,2388.285,2411.909,"That's who this letter is directed towards, with the strong position that this is a starting place, and they know this is also not the whole funding solution, but a starting place to help bring in additional progressive revenue sources, so we don't constantly have to rely on sales tax, and property tax.",64,,
377,0.97,2411.909,2413.043,I appreciate your consideration of that.,64,,
378,0.97,2413.043,2429.527,"I also want to recognize, for the good of the order, that we are going to have our next Finance Committee, Finance and housing committee meeting on February, Wednesday 19th at 2:00 P.M.",64,,
379,0.97,2429.527,2431.061,That will be a special committee.,64,,
380,0.97,2431.061,2432.763,We had to move it due to the Monday holiday.,64,,
381,0.97,2432.763,2433.564,Wednesday at 2:00 P.M.,64,,
382,0.97,2433.564,2438.369,"We will have a vote on the capital projects list for 2020, which we discussed last week.",64,,
383,0.97,2438.369,2447.978,"We have Council and mayoral appointments, and this time, we will have a discussion on the future of work.",64,,
384,0.97,2447.978,2452.082,"Council colleagues, I will let you walk through the preview of the agenda, as you have many items on the agenda.",64,,
385,0.97,2452.082,2475.272,"If there aren't any concerns, I will briefly highlight Council bill 119726 is an ordinance relating to Renters rights, and Evictions, a resolution on good faith intent for future bargaining on the collective bargaining process related to Spog, the transportation utilities Committee for the move oversight committee, the Finance and housing committee.",64,,
386,0.97,2475.272,2482.379,"We have an appointment to the Renters systems board, and the labor standards advisory committee.",64,,
387,0.97,2482.379,2483.28,That concludes the President's's report.,64,,
388,0.97,2483.28,2483.547,Okay.,65,,
389,0.97,2483.547,2484.381,Councilmember Sawant,66,,
390,0.97,2484.381,2485.382,"Thank you, president Mosqueda.",67,,

392,0.97,2485.883,2487.017,But good morning.,67,,
393,0.97,2487.017,2488.619,"On that letter, I strongly support it.",68,,
394,0.97,2488.619,2490.054,I am happy to sign it.,68,,
395,0.97,2493.657,2507.738,"On today's agenda, there is one item from the Sustainability and Renter's rights committee that my office sponsored, to ban cruel winter Evictions during the coldest and Wettest months of the year.",68,,
396,0.97,2507.738,2508.839,This would be Precedent-Setting legislation.,68,,
397,0.97,2508.839,2517.047,It is modeled after a very successful ban on winter Evictions it has been in effect in France for 70 years.,68,,
398,0.97,2517.047,2520.951,"However, as far as we can determine, it would be the first of its kind in the United States.",68,,
399,0.97,2520.951,2531.262,"Hopefully, we will not only provide additional protections to Renters this time from winter Evictions in our city, but also inspire other cities, and States across the country to do the same.",68,,
400,0.97,2531.262,2541.872,"I wanted to share this article from Dan Beekman of the ""Seattle times ."" it's extremely informative.",68,,
401,0.97,2541.872,2544.074,On winter Evictions.,68,,
402,0.97,2544.074,2551.382,"On the bill itself, but also the context in which this bill has been put forward.",68,,
403,0.97,2551.382,2562.159,"As you know, and was put forward from my office in response to a strong recommendation from the city of Seattle Renter's Commission.",68,,
404,0.97,2562.159,2570.901,This article contains a lot kind of data that shows why this would be a good idea.,68,,
405,0.97,2570.901,2580.01,"In addition to what Dan Beekman has here, I have shared numerous times with you, though losing housing report.",68,,
406,0.97,2580.01,2581.478,"Nearly 10,000 of those evicted ended up homeless.",68,,
407,0.97,2581.478,2585.316,Many of them were children.,68,,
408,0.97,2585.316,2607.037,"They were overwhelmingly from black households, so really, we are talking about black women and children, who are the most deeply impacted, and we see the Eviction process itself is what you would call means tested in the sense that middle-class people don't fall prey to Evictions.",68,,
409,0.97,2607.037,2620.351,"It's marginalized, and vulnerable people who make up the majority of those evicted, and the study also found, in the sample, that they were evaluating four of the evicted tenants, four convicted committed suicide.",68,,
410,0.97,2631.996,2636.934,"The Statistics are Countywide because that's how they are tracked, but it's clear Seattle has a big part of setting the standards right, as well.",68,,
411,0.97,2636.934,2644.875,"And, I think, the Beekman article talks about how there have been over 1000 Evictions in King County, in this last year, which is just a stunning member.",68,,
412,0.97,2644.875,2647.077,I also wanted to say that I'm sure you have all seen.,68,,
413,0.97,2647.077,2673.904,"I don't have copies of it, but the two small landlords wrote an opinion editorial in the ""Seattle times ."" we haven't found any actual evidence that will back up the concerns they have.",68,,
414,0.97,2673.904,2683.213,"I understand their concerns, but to me, or to my office, which has done a lot of work around this for several weeks, it seems like there is a whole range of what if's, which is understandable, but what if is not enough to formulate policy.",68,,
415,0.97,2683.213,2685.082,It has to be backed up by data.,68,,
416,0.97,2685.082,2692.189,"One of the Co-Authors of the Op- Ed from the landlords actually met with my staff, and then they told us, they have actually never evicted anyone, so they wouldn't even be impacted by this law really.",68,,
417,0.97,2692.189,2696.86,"It's meant to protect the tenants of corporate landlords, and Slumlords, who wind up having an Expletive approach to very poor households.",68,,
418,0.97,2711.575,2717.147,"Just to give background of all the steps we've taken, this bill was recommended by the city of Seattle Renter's Commission in early November of last year.",68,,
419,0.97,2717.147,2725.022,"In December, my office introduced the first draft, and then at the Sustainability and printers rights committee we discussed an amended version of the draft, which was already amended dramatically to create exceptions for situations like criminal activity.",68,,
420,0.97,2725.022,2744.775,"Remodeled it after the existing just cause Evictions ordinance, and we passed it out of committee with a recommendation for a vote at the city council on February 3. on the 3RD, the Council delayed the bill, holding it to today, which Councilmembers wanted to Primmer more amendments, but I am a little disappointed.",68,,
421,0.97,2744.775,2753.283,"I am quite disappointed to see most of the amendments are going to make it more difficult, and more restrictive for Renters to be protected.",68,,
422,0.97,2753.283,2755.152,I know Councilmembers will go over their own amendments.,68,,
423,0.97,2755.152,2764.495,"I will save my comments for later, but the exception to my concerns is Councilmember Lewis's amendment, which he brought forward during committee.",68,,
424,0.97,2764.495,2767.698,I support it.,68,,
425,0.97,2767.698,2780.644,"The order was ready last week, but all of the other amendments would be watering down this legislation to make it more effective.",68,,
426,0.97,2780.644,2781.812,Just to quickly summarize my concerns.,68,,
427,0.97,2781.812,2786.683,I'm not sure how Renters who go to court are supposed to know that they need to demonstrate how many units there landlord owns.,68,,
428,0.97,2786.683,2795.425,"I can tell you, my own office, and just sort of doing an experimental project has found it quite hard to find out how many units are owned by any given Expletive landlords like Haglund.",68,,
429,0.97,2795.425,2807.938,I don't know how someone is supposed to have that information.,68,,
430,0.97,2807.938,2815.412,"As for means testing, there is just a long, long series of documentary evidence to show that any program designed to support low income people is best designed if it's not means tested from S.N.A.P.",68,,
431,0.97,2815.412,2822.152,To the utility program.,68,,
432,0.97,2822.152,2824.454,Every piece of evidence shows means testing becomes a barrier.,68,,
433,0.97,2824.454,2827.057,I would urge Councilmembers to think about who needs our support the most.,68,,
434,0.97,2827.057,2835.199,"Is it the most vulnerable Renters, who are being evicted, or landlords who own multiple households and exploit, not the landlords who are not exploiting their tenants.",68,,

436,0.97,2847.177,2848.345,Just one more item.,68,,
437,0.97,2848.345,2878.075,"At today's city council meeting, I also probably to work on a vote for a resolution opposing any effort to ban cities like Seattle from enacting progressive business taxes, such as the Amazon movement that has not already been growing since last year' election and has had many successful events with hundreds of people actively participating, and dozens of organizations, including progressive labor unions.",68,,
438,0.97,2878.075,2878.809,We have just discussed it.,68,,
439,0.97,2878.809,2881.979,The immediate danger is the Preemption.,68,,
440,0.97,2881.979,2882.379,Not the revenues.,68,,
441,0.97,2882.379,2885.415,I want to make it clear again and again that we welcome the revenues.,68,,
442,0.97,2885.415,2914.645,"But we do reject any possibility of Preemption, and as President Mosqueda said, we need to have every tool at our disposal, every tool in our Toolbox.",68,,
443,0.97,2914.645,2917.08,"I support the letter, but I hope my colleagues will support the resolution.",68,,
444,0.97,2917.08,2920.484,I sent you all a draft last Friday to support progressive business taxes and oppose Preemption.,68,,
445,0.97,2920.484,2924.421,The resolution URGES Mayor Jenny Durkan to publicly oppose Preemption and request Intergovernmental relations to advocate these positions in Olympia.,68,,
446,0.97,2924.421,2941.571,"Council colleagues, I want to make sure folks know, on the Eviction one, if there is any concern that the bill is not going to be fully amended out there, and that it will run smoothly with ongoing debate, I will ask to hold it.",69,,
447,0.97,2941.571,2954.785,"If this kind of conversation around the multiple number of amendments doesn't look like it's going to be fully baked up there, I think it's more important for us to have the bill ready to go as it comes to Council.",69,,
448,0.97,2954.785,2977.274,"As I read it, I think all of these amendments line up, and if they were included or not included, the bill could move out today, but I just want to signal that I think, if folks feel confident that we can move it forward today, I will, but if it ends up long and drawn out, I think there is more work to do.",69,,
449,0.97,2977.274,2981.411,"Instead of sending it back to Committee, it might make sense to hold it, but let's have a conversation out there.",69,,
450,0.97,2981.411,2983.213,It looks like the amendments are ready to go.,69,,
451,0.97,2983.213,2989.72,"My desire would be that we include the amendments today, or at least have a vote on the amendments today, and move the bill out.",69,,
452,0.97,2989.72,3002.733,"If the Councilmembers who have amendments want to weigh in on this, but in response to what you're saying, I would prefer the bill to be passed out of full council today.",70,,
453,0.97,3002.733,3011.041,"I have my own position on the amendments, but I don't need additional time.",70,,
454,0.97,3011.041,3012.509,Then we would move the bill.,71,,
455,0.97,3012.509,3014.244,I want to move the bill today.,72,,
456,0.97,3014.244,3014.544,Great.,73,,
457,0.97,3014.544,3014.845,Questions?,73,,
458,0.97,3014.845,3015.045,Okay.,73,,

462,0.97,3030.26,3041.338,We will be taking a brief recess after full Council and Reconvening probably at this table to have it feel more like a committee after the meeting.,74,,
463,0.97,3041.338,3053.884,"I really encourage everyone to come, and definitely five of you, so we have a Quorum, but we will be considering Councilmember Sawant's transitional encampment ordinance.",74,,
464,0.97,3053.884,3069.599,"Ketil Freeman circulated I believe yesterday afternoon, a memo discussing the status of where we are in terms of the amendments that have been proposed, and a brief discussion of all of the amendments.",74,,
465,0.97,3069.599,3073.003,"Thank you, everybody, for working with central staff to get those in.",74,,
466,0.97,3073.003,3075.605,It's a pretty good summary of where we are.,74,,
467,0.97,3075.605,3087.017,Just review the Email prior to that Committee hearing to get a good overview of the situation of where the amendments are.,74,,
468,0.97,3087.017,3098.862,"Just as a reminder, I intend to hold a vote on that.",74,,
469,0.97,3099.096,3116.446,"This afternoon, so we can Queue it up a week from now to make sure our partners and the nonprofit sector who operate a lot of these transitional Encampments get ample notice of the new permitting authority, so that there is a smooth transition, and we are not putting them in a position where they potentially might have to scramble, or have some uncertainty.",74,,
470,0.97,3116.446,3121.151,"So, that is my plan currently, and I look forward to that conversation.",74,,

626,0.97,4245.074,4278.173,"I requested that Councilmember Lewis and into his amendment, a requirement that if the landlord is paid directly from this Fund, because there is some lack of clarity whether or not it's going to be a landlord access Fund, or a a tenant Ccess Fund, but if the landlord is paid directly, they must find an agreement that they will not report or rent Delinquencies to credit agencies.",101,,
627,0.97,4278.173,4286.415,I think it's important that tenants not be held liable for damages associated with passed due rent in those instances that the rent has been paid.,101,,

638,0.97,4338.167,4350.379,"We are going to hear from the office of Inspector General on the 2020 Workplan, and we will be receiving a director's report from acting director Johnson, of the human services Department.",105,,
639,0.97,4350.379,4358.387,"He will cover a high-level overview of the Department's work areas, and 2020 goals.",105,,
640,0.97,4358.387,4363.025,"Just to clarify, he will not cover issues related to homelessness investments because those are the Purview of the select Committee on homelessness.",105,,
641,0.97,4363.025,4381.977,"Finally, I want to, again, some like the fact that I will be distributing, in the select Committee on homelessness, strategies and investments, a letter related to a budget priority of the Council last year.",105,,

644,0.97,4387.716,4391.52,You should have received it over the weekend.,105,,
645,0.97,4391.52,4413.242,"The intent is to share with the executive of the home for good pilot should last for 12 months, even though, because we are actually developing a new program, we may not actually complete a contract for that program until first quarter.",105,,
646,0.97,4413.242,4415.043,Home for good is the name of the pilot.,105,,
647,0.97,4415.043,4418.947,It's in development to prevent or end homelessness for people over 50 years old living on Federal disability benefits.,105,,
648,0.97,4418.947,4430.926,"If it's inadequate to cover the cost of rent, and still have enough money to live on even in subsidized housing, the population is left vulnerable.",105,,

651,0.97,4445.34,4458.153,"It explains the Disconnect between the state and Federal policy that pushes people like Mister Williams into homelessness, even after receiving both state, and Federal subsidies to assist them.",105,,
652,0.97,4458.153,4469.498,"Through three separate Council budget actions last year, the Council allocated $750,000 to create, and evaluate a pilot project that would provide frontal Substudy to try to stabilize their housing.",105,,

655,0.97,4479.875,4486.615,There was confusion as to whether or not the funds must be expended by December 31.,105,,
656,0.97,4495.757,4498.627,The intent of the Council is for a full 12 months worth of funding.,105,,
657,0.97,4498.627,4516.845,"Last year, this would make for a really short project, if it was more like nine months worth of funding since the human services Department is still in the process of developing the program, developing an Rfp, issuing an Rfp, and then selecting a provider based on responses to the Rfp, and also negotiating contracts.",105,,
658,0.97,4516.845,4525.02,It is not a typical for the executive to take the first corner of a year.,105,,
659,0.97,4525.02,4532.261,During this program development.,105,,
660,0.97,4532.261,4536.765,We want to make sure the Council's intent from last year be clear.,105,,
661,0.97,4536.765,4552.18,"And that this letter simply expresses that the Council understands that based on Stakeholder input, that the pilot may be most effective if it's a full year's worth of funding, meaning extend funding into 2021.",105,,
662,0.97,4552.18,4561.957,This Council may be considering additional process charges this year.,105,,
