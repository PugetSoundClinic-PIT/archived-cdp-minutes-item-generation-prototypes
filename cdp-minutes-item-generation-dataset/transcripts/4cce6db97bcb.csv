41,0.97,394.761,420.353,Good afternoon . Yeah . good afternoon . Howard Gayle . two and a half years after George Floyd the budget to Council is considering still proposes more money for the police in and wastes over (1) 100-0000 on a police accountability system that still has police investigating police . This is $11 million spent denying victims any appeals . Despite this there are hopeful signs.,37,,
42,0.97,420.353,472.772,"Council members Mosqueda, Morales and Herbold met with advocates for families impacted by police violence recently resulting in Council member Mosqueda taking a huge and important step by introducing a budget amendment to start a process for supporting families impacted by police violence and investigating an appeals process for adverse decisions made by the office of police accountability . This is a small but very important step that Seattle's police Chaining and policy create . It is moral and practical statement that offers a glimmer of hope that after a decade of help promises we can see some light ask hope that impacted families will receive the aid they need to navigate an unjust system . Thank you.",37,,
43,0.97,472.772,483.249,For offering your strong public support for budget amendment SB 101A in the coming weeks.,37,,

55,0.97,607.473,639.672,I hope to continue to live here and take over my family's business as long as I can afford to do so . which I think is the reality for many young workers here and vulnerable community members who want to invest in and love a city that is Unaffordable and impossible to exist in . young workers are direct--we reject the beliefs that there are no easy answers and that there is no obvious way out of the budget crisis.,42,,
56,0.97,639.672,672.538,"Struggling workers cannot pay for Seattle's budget hold . We reject taxes, a $10 tab fee increase or cruel consideration for folks living paycheck to paycheck during an economic crisis . especially in the wake of the pandemic . young people in the most vulnerable understand who suffers most during crisis . We struggle to pay rent while corporations and wealthy profit in a city with the second largest billionaire wealth in the country.",42,,
57,0.97,672.538,720.953,"Corporations are responsible for budget holds, not us . It is time for the wealth Dwroi invest their profits back into our city and communities .--to address or reduce public revenues projected for next year . um, I also urge dish don't know what they are called but Council member Morales' three amendments to support the I-135 bill and urge Council members to keep in touch with young community members investing in the city and vote yes prove Posal .

We had several--I should say many qualified candidates but one that stood out most of all was William bill Burton . and, having worked with bill over these years as board of advisor and King County board member, I found him to be one of the upstanding communities a asset when he is in Seattle . Bill became like a Piper . and still is . He recruited an outstanding board for many years and retire added a few years ago . his vision was realized years ago when the new boys and girls Club was opened . It was a two story (2) 400-0000 facility that bill campaigned for generating those funds for the community .
