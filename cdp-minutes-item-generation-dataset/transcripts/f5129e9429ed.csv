58,0.97,339.539,348.981,It continues to be very specific when directing the executive towards selecting an organization with close ties to Fcw and stake holder in the process.,16,,
59,0.97,348.981,359.325,That organization being in Washington and the connection being the President of the UFCW is also the President of Washington.,16,,
60,0.97,359.325,364.03,We asked if there's credible nonprofit entities and so far no one has been able to offer up any.,16,,
61,0.97,364.03,371.204,We appreciate language putting a college at the helm but they have to partner with an organization like we train Washington.,16,,
62,0.97,371.204,381.314,"This is a significant enough issue that it could potentially make it difficult, if not impossible for the CCC and members to participate in this going forward.",16,,
63,0.97,381.314,390.223,The Ccp supports a fair and neutral assessment to identify real social equity needs by putting a stake holder into a controlling role.,16,,
64,0.97,390.223,400.833,We hope you will agree that giving one stake holder more control of the process or greater representation within it would be Inapprpriate.,16,,
65,0.97,400.833,405.772,Thank you for your time.,16,,
66,0.97,405.772,407.573,Thank you.,17,,

70,0.97,430.196,439.205,As an industry worker I can't understate the importance of having high standards for conducting Cannabis needs assessment.,18,,
71,0.97,439.205,452.919,"The benefit of limiting if they are conducted by a nonprofit entity with expertise in training and development, we can better assure accuracy and impartiality which will benefit the overall intent of the proposal we have here.",18,,
72,0.97,452.919,464.63,"In addition to that, I feel the advisory committee would be better served by the presence of representatives of labor who stand to leverage the interest of Cannabis workers.",18,,
73,0.97,464.63,478.778,"Also calling in support of the proposed amendments section three, it's crucial that Ex-Spongement involves a collaborative effort with lived experience in the criminal justice system.",18,,
74,0.97,478.778,498.064,"However Suting, these nuances do have dramatic effect on the intent of the proposed amendment naming and including labor rights, communities negatively affected by the war on drugs and those with lived experience in the criminal justice system actively defines intentional elements of inclusion and justice in this proposal.",18,,

90,0.97,572.538,582.715,"I agree that it's very important to appoint workers, industry members and key community members to support the Cannabis needs assessment.",22,,
91,0.97,582.715,600.9,I believe Ms. Nelson's amendment proposal was in my opinion too owner investor specific in regards to its composition and I personally feel there are other groups that are involved in the Cannabis community that will lose the opportunity to be considered under Ms. Nelson specific proposal.,22,,
92,0.97,600.9,609.742,"Again, I really like to be on this advisory committee that will help do the research and provide assessment and analysis on this ordinance.",22,,
93,0.97,609.742,615.414,And I just want to end it by saying the legislation is off to a good start.,22,,

104,0.97,689.321,690.556,And we are replaced.,25,,
105,0.97,690.556,703.169,This act would protect workers and when a business is sold and make it so that the new owner can't fire and replace the workers that built the company beforehand.,25,,

277,0.97,1778.61,1798.329,A lot of the people that work in these Cannabis stores are black and Brown people and marginalized communities and the reason I support Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda's assessment is because a lot of times workers voices are left out.,58,,
278,0.97,1798.329,1808.573,And you can't have a thriving company if you have high turn Overand workers are not knowing what they're doing making bad sales or bad products.,58,,

304,0.97,1989.22,1991.022,Reflect on how we got here.,61,,
305,0.97,1991.022,2013.277,"Yes, this is a conversation that our office and this committee has been engaged in throughout the year but this is an opportunity for us to pause and process and really reflect on how many organizations individuals, business owners, workers as you have heard over the last few meetings and public testimony have been pushing back against harmful policies.",61,,
306,0.97,2013.277,2020.118,Policies caused by the Federal war on drugs but also harmful policies that came out of city hall not even ten years ago.,61,,

308,0.97,2051.215,2062.059,"As you also heard in public comment, this is a small step of small step in the right direction towards undoing those past Harms.",61,,
309,0.97,2062.059,2112.944,"I want to Specificallily thank the folks who laid the ground for the small steps today, the ground work led by black excellence and Emerald city collective, African American affairs Commission and organizes working on this issue across a region including UFCW 3,000 working in partnership with black life community organizations over the past few years and I want to thank our city staff, largely people of color led from the Finance and Strauf services Department, office of civil rights who have been working diligently in community over the last three to four years initiating the racial equity tool kit analysis in 2018 and directly having conversations on behalf of the city on how things can be done differently.",61,,

315,0.97,2205.336,2214.712,It's clear that our government policy versus caused harm as you have heard from public testimony directly from Vinls caused by the public policies that cause harm.,61,,
316,0.97,2214.712,2223.154,And we should be centering much of our policy strategies to address harm on those who experience harm directly.,61,,

322,0.97,2250.648,2266.43,Unfortunately there are some situations where we have competing amendments so we'll have a chance to walk through those as well with central staff so each Councilmember understands which items might be in competition so when we take a vote you understand the implications for the other.,61,,

327,0.97,2307.705,2309.373,120391.,61,,
328,0.97,2309.707,2315.713,I heard a second.,61,,
329,0.97,2316.013,2325.99,.,61,,
330,0.97,2426.657,2429.16,If you would prefer me to share my screen.,62,,
331,0.97,2429.16,2430.961,"That would be great, thanks.",63,,
332,0.97,2430.961,2431.228,One moment.,64,,
333,0.97,2431.562,2440.805,Is okay can everybody see the table?,64,,
334,0.97,2440.805,2444.275,"You know, thank you for bringing it up.",65,,
335,0.97,2444.275,2459.957,We have a small screen in the room here today so we will do our best and I know folks can also find it in the central staff memo for thanks for sharing that for folks watching electronically.,65,,
336,0.97,2459.957,2460.224,Go ahead.,65,,
337,0.97,2460.224,2460.558,Okay.,66,,
338,0.97,2460.558,2463.994,So first up for discussion is amendment one.,66,,
339,0.97,2463.994,2466.063,It's sponsored by Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda.,66,,
340,0.97,2466.063,2472.503,The amendment would add a new section with more detail about who should do the Cannabis needs assessment.,66,,
341,0.97,2472.503,2494.091,"It would specify the needs assessment should be conducted by a Seattle based educational institution in partnership with a nonprofit organization with experience in curriculum development, administering retail training and apprenticeship programs and is not primarily funded by Cannabis business or employer associations.",66,,
342,0.97,2494.091,2501.599,"As you mentioned Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda, amendment one and amendment two sponsored by Councilmember Sara Nelson are mutually exclusive.",66,,
343,0.97,2501.599,2505.836,Would you like me to describe amendment two at this point so they can be discussed together?,66,,
344,0.97,2505.836,2509.206,"That would be fine, thank you Amy.",67,,
345,0.97,2509.206,2510.407,Go ahead.,67,,
346,0.97,2510.407,2539.603,"Amendment two as I mentioned sponsored by Councilmember Sara Nelson would add specificity to the bill ask clarify the needs assessment shall be conducted by an independent academic institution with local experience identifying training needs for workers, developing industry specific training curriculum and developing job skills programs and like I mentioned, those two are mutually exclusive and therefore the committee needs to vote on one or the other.",68,,
347,0.97,2539.603,2540.337,Thank you so much.,69,,
348,0.97,2540.337,2546.677,So colleagues what I'm going to do is make some comments about amendment number one.,69,,
349,0.97,2546.677,2558.656,I'll then allow Councilmember Sara Nelson so make comments about amendment number two and we'll have folks ask questions they may have and we will go ahead and move to put them in front of us.,69,,
350,0.97,2558.656,2566.463,"If amendment one passes Obamaly then amendment two would Fot be Feeded and amendment one does not pass, amendment two would be considered.",69,,
351,0.97,2566.463,2569.7,"With that, I'll go ahead and share comments.",69,,
352,0.97,2569.7,2573.47,I want to thank folks providing feedback on amendment number one.,69,,
353,0.97,2573.47,2606.27,"We did hear including from some of my colleagues as well that there was a need to make sure we are updating the language in amendment number one according to that feedback, we worked diligently to make sure we're in conversation with the Mayor's office as well who in committee Exresed contracting with the Enl occasional institution and I took the opportunity to work in partnership with my Council colleagues who had reached out on it and also with the Mayor's office to find some common ground here.",69,,
354,0.97,2606.27,2621.652,Unfortunately I didn't know there was a proposed amendment in competition so I was working in good faith to find that so I'll summarize the Amendmet and read what the needs assessment is intending to do.,69,,
355,0.97,2621.652,2637.601,It says the city will fund a Cannabis needs assessment to further clarify what improvements are needed in the industry to support the city in moving forward.,69,,
356,0.97,2637.601,2661.692,"At a minimum the city will provide demographic information about workers, workers currently employed in the Seattle Cannabis industry and in addition to evaluating the training needs of the incumbent work force, the study will evaluate and determine the highest training feeds for workers who wish to advance in the industry beyond entry level positions and those seeking to become new Onners.",69,,
357,0.97,2661.692,2668.132,The study will include recommendations about whether and how to fund such training.,69,,
358,0.97,2668.132,2678.108,I read this because it's Spornt we remember the needs assessment is really centered on what the work force needs.,69,,
359,0.97,2678.108,2691.555,It talks about how workers can become owners but the intention is to develop an assessment for work force development.,69,,
360,0.97,2691.555,2701.198,"That's something embraced by both parties, by both business and labor and this is absolutely in the same vein as work force development.",69,,
361,0.97,2701.198,2715.379,"When we talk about work force development and improved training and what we need to create safer environments for front line workers and allow for mobility, it's always included workers and employers at the table.",69,,
362,0.97,2715.379,2725.255,"When we talk about improving labor laws, we know that labor laws are strongest when they have workers at the table, folks who represent workers and business.",69,,
363,0.97,2725.255,2742.005,There's no difference here in what we're talking about in Aamendment number one includes working with a nonprofit through a partnership with the local schools to make sure that we bring both business and workers to the table.,69,,
364,0.97,2742.005,2746.21,Our labor laws in Washington state are some of the strongest around the country.,69,,
365,0.97,2746.21,2751.381,Our labor laws in Seattle are some of the strongest around the country.,69,,
366,0.97,2751.381,2765.629,"And our local economies in Washington State and Seattle are some of the strongest around the country because we brought workers, Union representatives, associations and employers to the table.",69,,
367,0.97,2765.629,2786.95,There's nothing to here by putting forward a proposal that is universally applauded when we talk about how we create work force standard development and what we have done in this region to create strong apprenticeship programs that are applauded by busines and labor so I want to be clear.,69,,
368,0.97,2786.95,2803.734,What this legislation is intending to do is help workers create safer environment and upward mobility and insure we're looking at work force development embraced by other arenas.,69,,
369,0.97,2803.734,2815.379,The comments I've seen submitted via letters and public testimony earlier today brought up concerns around unions and the Anti-Union comments are actually Anti-Worker.,69,,
370,0.97,2815.379,2831.395,"That's harmful rhetoric in a place like Seattle in Washington state where we have stood by workers because we know when we stand by workers, it improves the stability of local employers and improves our local economy.",69,,
371,0.97,2831.395,2841.538,"We may have other places around this country that are largely Anti-Union and that rhetoric could fly but not here, not in our state or this city.",69,,
372,0.97,2841.538,2879.476,"We have seen the benefits of bringing workers and businesses to the table so I want to put this forward truly with the intent of making sure that we have an entity that is knowledgeable about this sector, knowledgeable about the growth and the flexibility that is needed for us to respond to both state regulations changing and the opportunity for employers as well as workers to be able to evolve in this industry with a knowledgeable partner that can work in partnership with local Seattle school institutions.",69,,
373,0.97,2879.476,2904.835,I'm proud of the work we have done in partnership with the Mayor's office on this legislation and the amendment here as amended which gives difference to the Mayor's office in partnership with the Seattle based entity who truly knows how to bring together workers and businesses can help us identify ways to make sure this is assessment is needed.,69,,
374,0.97,2904.835,2920.217,"You really want to make sure that the words like work force development and apprenticeship are not seen as dirty words nor should the terms ""Union"" or"" nonprofit"".",69,,
375,0.97,2920.217,2934.998,To have concern around Nonprofits being raised Relays to me this is not about the intent of the assessment this is a concern about worker unions and this is not a place for that discussion.,69,,
376,0.97,2934.998,2943.674,This is an opportunity to find out how we can best pull together workers and businesses to move forward on the needs assessment.,69,,
377,0.97,2943.674,2966.63,"So with that I appreciate the opportunity to work with some colleagues who reached out on this amendment and in addition to that, with the Mayor's office for help in thinking through the School-Based or educational institutional based approach here and I do hope I can earn your support for amendment number one.",69,,
378,0.97,2966.63,2975.372,"With that, Councilmember Sara Nelson would you like to walk through amendment number two?",69,,
379,0.97,2975.372,2988.118,"For the folks in the room, if you would like to make Councilmember Sara Nelson's screen larger so we can see her, that would be great.",69,,
380,0.97,2988.118,2989.219,"Perfect, looks better.",69,,
381,0.97,2989.219,2998.462,Councilmember Sara Nelson we can't hear you.,69,,
382,0.97,2998.462,2999.396,You might be on mute still.,69,,
383,0.97,2999.396,3006.069,.,69,,
384,0.97,3006.069,3006.57,"Okay, thank you.",70,,
385,0.97,3006.57,3013.443,All right so I appreciate everyone who came out for public comment and the energy going into this legislation.,70,,
386,0.97,3013.443,3041.038,"It's important work and there's been a lot of work already done at the state level to advance social equity in Cannabis so I just want to focus on what's happened at the city so far and in 2018 FAS began work along with Oed, Sdci, OCR to eliminate racial disparities in Cannabis.",70,,
387,0.97,3041.038,3051.381,"Held two dozen stake holder engagements, convenes the Cannabis community forum in 2020 February and conducted a survey in 2019 Referenced in the past.",70,,
388,0.97,3051.381,3073.837,"But let me remind people, this survey was one of the purposes was to figure out ways to Redistribute wealth in the Cannabis industry and they went into looking at three different models, ownership Kren trick, work force cent Rick and community investment frame work so there's been a lot of work done on this front.",70,,
389,0.97,3073.837,3084.081,And one of the products of that work was the racial equity tool kit that came out of this Interdepartment mental effort.,70,,
390,0.97,3084.081,3089.586,They also produced five key policy change recommendations.,70,,
391,0.97,3089.586,3101.164,And the stake holders also put forward additional recommendations including align with the state's social equity task force recommendations.,70,,
392,0.97,3101.164,3111.608,"And in the end, there was a lot of agreement on the path going forward and this was all presented in the committee meeting on March 22nd.",70,,
393,0.97,3111.608,3182.179,"So it's clear that the city supports the Cannabis industry and as a whole and really does want to see it thrive so I would say if this legislation is really about advancing Cannabis equity, we need to listen to the community that has spoken, the black community members who have come today and have asked that their needs be centered in this discussion and going forward because otherwise, it seems as though it could be simply a vehicle for advancing the interest of an outside or special interest so all of that said, this needs assessment is a way even though there have been already a lot of needs that have been forwarded and we have also talked about public safety and training, I agree that there's much more that can be done so this needs assessment is intended I believe to surface additional ways we can advance equity.",70,,
394,0.97,3182.179,3193.123,"And if that's the case, we need an entity that's doing that that has expertise and can put out a product that will be useful.",70,,
395,0.97,3193.123,3204.367,And there were a couple of academic institutions mentioned by Paula in her comment.,70,,
396,0.97,3204.367,3217.38,"There's also another Academc institution here in town, Seattle central, they have a Cannabis Institute and it is designed to help workers progress in the industry.",70,,
397,0.97,3217.38,3227.991,So I am I Saing we have a lot of academic institution that is are well equipped to do this work and why is that important?,70,,
398,0.97,3227.991,3234.13,It's important because this whole process has to have the trust of everybody involved.,70,,
399,0.97,3234.13,3247.577,And needs to be bring everybody to the table both workers and actually the Cannabis community the retail owners because we're talk about going forward in a way that helps the industry as a whole.,70,,
400,0.97,3247.577,3254.484,So they need to have the trust of the participants and they have to be independent.,70,,
401,0.97,3254.484,3287.05,"Few Tral, not coming in with an agenda that's already been pretty clear in discussions that have happened with my office and as I've mentioned before so unless all the parties have confidence that the party conducting the needs assessment is fair and Unbiased, the assessment will lack credibility, won't be useful and it will lose the trust as we saw this morning the letter we want to keep everyone at the table.",70,,
402,0.97,3287.05,3303.366,E with E we don't want the retail owners to leave the table because they will be implementing the measures that come out of the needs assessment so I'm asking for an honest and transparent needs assessment to be conducted.,70,,
403,0.97,3303.366,3309.572,Not one that stacks the deck for a particular interest.,70,,
404,0.97,3309.572,3319.616,I'm asking for one that respects the expertise of the people that have been working in the Cannabis industry as employers and employees.,70,,
405,0.97,3319.616,3330.694,And just to go forward with some impartial work that will end I helping the whole community and the industry thrive in Seattle.,70,,
406,0.97,3330.694,3346.443,"And so I don't really know, that's my opening statements but I think it would be fruitful to talk about what Nonprofits is your amendment contemplating.",70,,
407,0.97,3346.776,3351.314,.,70,,
408,0.97,3351.314,3352.749,"Thank you, Councilmember Sara Nelson.",71,,
409,0.97,3352.749,3354.884,Councilmember Lisa Herbold go ahead.,71,,
410,0.97,3354.884,3356.052,Thank you.,72,,
411,0.97,3356.052,3365.462,I want to thank you Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda for making changes to your amendment since our last committee meeting.,72,,
412,0.97,3365.462,3439.035,"Making clear one that there isn't a specific nonprofit named and to our conversation with the Mayor's office, we heard from the Mayor's office that they will be in the driver's seat in the process to select the nonprofit partner and I just want to say as simply as possible, the idea of having the independent academic institution at the lead but Partnering with the nonprofit is simply to make sure that everybody who needs to be at the table is at the Taubl and is part of the nonprofit works with much like a lot of our academic worker needs surveys and academic work about the outcomes of our labor laws and the academic works with a nonprofit to do as we heard in public comment, some of the surveying and focus group work again to make sure everybody is at the table.",72,,
413,0.97,3439.035,3441.171,We want workers at the table.,72,,
414,0.97,3441.171,3478.842,"The organization that some people are concerned about is a labor management joint organization and we have found as Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda said, some of our best work force training programs have come about because of the partnership of workers and management, in this case store owners so in my mind, this amendment is intended to make sure that everybody is at the table moving forward as part of the assessment of the needs of the work force.",72,,
415,0.97,3478.842,3481.311,Thank you very much Councilmember Lisa Herbold.,73,,
416,0.97,3481.311,3487.617,"With that, it's helpful to go ahead and move into considering the amendments.",73,,
417,0.97,3487.617,3491.254,I move to amend Council bill 319 is there a second.,73,,
418,0.97,3491.254,3491.487,Yes.,74,,
419,0.97,3491.487,3495.725,Thank you it's been moved and Seconded.,75,,
420,0.97,3495.725,3502.932,I will not rehash the conversation we just had to tee up these amendments.,75,,
421,0.97,3502.932,3511.107,"I really appreciate Lisa Herbold distinct summary of the value of labor management entity but also again, underscoring a nonprofit.",75,,
422,0.97,3511.107,3516.045,The word nonprofit should not be a scary thing.,75,,
423,0.97,3516.045,3538.368,"As we hear folks raise concern, I want to make sure it's important for us to know that this is really an effort to work with an academic institution and this is important and what we hoped for but when we initially introduced the amendment we were incredibly neutral as on the organization in the amendment we sent to law.",75,,
424,0.97,3538.368,3548.578,"The feedback we got from law was that we needed to actually have some examples, be specific and say such as where possible and so we tried to do that.",75,,
425,0.97,3548.578,3566.362,But want to make sure we are incorporating the feedback and making this a difference to the Mayor's office in partnership with the city of Seattle based educational institution and working to lift up the Vl of bringing employers and employees to the table.,75,,
426,0.97,3566.362,3574.737,Thanks so much for considering this amendment and Councilmember Sara Nelson for the purposes of debate.,75,,
427,0.97,3574.737,3579.676,So I don't think that nonprofit is a bad name.,76,,
428,0.97,3579.676,3587.116,Just simply wondering what nonprofit but that's not my point for raising my hand.,76,,
429,0.97,3587.116,3607.036,Your amendment just says educational institution and makes no mention of independent or academic so that I believe that that is really crucial to spell that out which is why I put it into my amendment.,76,,
430,0.97,3607.036,3608.771,Thank you Councilmember Sara Nelson.,77,,
431,0.97,3608.771,3625.822,The good news folks is that Councilmember Sara Nelson and I have a very harmonious piece of language to consider after this so we'll talk more about the neutrality and balance as well that we are speaking to in the next amendment.,77,,
432,0.97,3625.822,3637.834,The amendment in front of us one any additional comment Sns hearing none Madame clerk call the role on adoption of amendment one.,77,,
433,0.97,3637.834,3639.369,I have an additional comment.,78,,
434,0.97,3639.369,3677.407,So you just made me realize that we will have representation depending on how this goes down the advisory committee is a place where we can have a specific role for lever so that will be presented in the body that defines the scope of work of this needs assessment so I'm asking for this to be a solely neutral body that does Fot have people that will then be part of the advisory committee.,79,,
435,0.97,3677.407,3680.643,Thank you so much.,80,,
436,0.97,3680.643,3695.158,"Again, I would reiterate, neutral means bringing people to the table which is what an entity does when they bring in workers and employers to figure out training strategies to move forward.",80,,
437,0.97,3695.158,3713.943,It's important for us also to consider the needs assessment brings in the best practices and looks at ways to enhance training and opportunity within the industry and so having subject matter experts on the industry is really the goal here and then we'll talk about that balance table in just a second.,80,,
438,0.97,3713.943,3716.979,Okay it's been moved and Seconded.,80,,
439,0.97,3716.979,3726.122,"All those in favor, Madame clerk could you call the role on adoption of the amendment one.",80,,
440,0.97,3726.122,3730.259,Councilmember Lisa Herbold yes.,81,,
441,0.97,3730.259,3731.661,Councilmember Alex Pedersen.,82,,

444,0.97,3735.698,3736.699,Yeah.,85,,
445,0.97,3736.699,3738.201,Councilmember Sara Nelson.,86,,

450,0.97,3741.571,3744.006,Ma DOM chair Teresa Mosqueda.,90,,
451,0.97,3744.006,3744.24,Aye.,91,,
452,0.97,3744.24,3748.444,"Madame chair that is three in favor, two opposed.",92,,
453,0.97,3748.444,3749.278,Thank you very much.,93,,
454,0.97,3749.278,3753.95,The motion carries and amendment number one is adopted.,93,,
455,0.97,3753.95,3767.563,Amy I assume that means that amendment two is not up for consideration should we move to amendment number three as amended?,93,,
456,0.97,3767.563,3772.869,Is that the parliamentarian step in here?,94,,
457,0.97,3772.869,3777.473,Can two amendments not proceed to full council discussion and vote?,94,,
458,0.97,3777.473,3783.412,Would you like to weigh in on that?,95,,
459,0.97,3783.412,3790.92,"Yes, Teresa Mosqueda at this point amendment number two cannot be considered because amendment one was adopted.",96,,
460,0.97,3790.92,3801.631,That does not prohibit the sponsor to bring back or bring forward amendment number two to the city council Smeeting on September 6th.,96,,
461,0.97,3801.631,3804.167,Thank you so much.,97,,
462,0.97,3804.167,3810.64,Okay we will go ahead and again talk about where we have common ground.,97,,
463,0.97,3810.64,3821.35,We have distributed electronically to the Councilmembers I believe it's going to be included in the minutes but we have also hard copies here at the desk for folks in person.,97,,
464,0.97,3821.35,3833.996,Councilmember Sara Nelson and myself did have the opportunity to talk about amendments three and four and really work to find common ground and balance.,97,,
465,0.97,3833.996,3842.939,"Councilmember Sara Nelson, we have this joint amendment and I'm going to defer to you for opening comments but first, I would like to put the amendment in front of us if that sounds okay.",97,,
466,0.97,3843.272,3857.153,I move to amend Council bill 3091 as presented on walk on amendment version three is there a second?,97,,
467,0.97,3857.153,3857.42,Second.,98,,
468,0.97,3857.42,3860.022,Thank you very much.,99,,
469,0.97,3860.022,3868.731,It's moved and second walk on amendment version 2 is in front of us Councilember Sara Nelson would you like to speak to the intent behind the amendment?,99,,
470,0.97,3868.731,3879.575,"Yes, the intent is to get a representation of people that are involved in and have a stake in the Cannabis industry.",100,,
471,0.97,3879.575,3888.451,So the first cat Gour here is representatives from organizations that advocate for the Cannabis industry and its workers.,100,,
472,0.97,3888.451,3899.328,And I believe that there are two clear stand outs here and would most likely come down to UFCW and craft Cannabis collective.,100,,
473,0.97,3899.328,3912.341,We have to have fair and even representation and so that is why that number is two and these people are important because they represent the industry as a whole.,100,,
474,0.97,3912.341,3914.377,They're not owners or workers.,100,,
475,0.97,3914.377,3922.518,They represent the interest of the industry and they know what's happening at a national level.,100,,
476,0.97,3922.518,3938.434,They can identify best Prak Tess and come with some ideas for the needs assessment so that's why in industry representation category is important and that's why the number is two.,100,,
477,0.97,3938.434,3953.783,I also felt strongly and we agreed that the people who will be benefitting from and implementing whatever recommendations come out of the needs assessment be represented and I'm talking about employees and owners.,100,,
478,0.97,3953.783,3961.357,They're the ones that will be living day-to-day with the improvements that come forward.,100,,
479,0.97,3961.357,3971.3,They will also stand to gain from the benefits that are provided in the other two pieces of legislation.,100,,
480,0.97,3971.3,3981.577,"So this category is to as you can read it, two industry workers, two business owners and that also is an even split.",100,,
481,0.97,3981.577,3993.155,"Then Finally, the last categories three represented is from the communities that have been historically harmed by the war on drugs or who have advocated for Cannabis equity in King County.",100,,
482,0.97,3993.155,4004.4,And with a priority for those that meet the social equity criteria already put forward by the state.,100,,
483,0.97,4004.4,4020.116,"Clearly trying to have alignment what's been done at the state level around identifying equity partners, the people in this category do not have to be someone who is trying to get a license.",100,,
484,0.97,4020.116,4028.824,But they do have to view closely to the criteria we have identified and trying to help.,100,,
485,0.97,4028.824,4037.333,So that number is three and I think that this is a good representation of the industry in general.,100,,
486,0.97,4037.333,4042.772,They can put forward a work scope that will be robust and fair.,100,,
487,0.97,4043.105,4044.807,.,100,,
488,0.97,4044.807,4046.542,"Excellent, thank you very much Councilmember Sara Nelson.",101,,
489,0.97,4046.542,4050.846,I'll just add to that and we'll see if there's additional Questionings.,101,,
490,0.97,4050.846,4069.465,I want to thank Councilmember Sara Nelson for the feedback over the last week to be able to find balance in this amendment is what both of us intend to do.,101,,
491,0.97,4069.465,4075.805,"This has three categories, business representatives, labor representatives and community representatives equally balanced.",101,,
492,0.97,4075.805,4093.222,The important note that Councilmember Sara Nelson put in the first section there in the amendment language is that Ideally this would include one person from the industry Association and one person representing workers.,101,,
493,0.97,4093.222,4136.232,"Those two categories are complimented by two worker representatives and two Employeer Dez IG knee representatives making three in each column and complimented by the third category of three community organizations directly harmed by the war on drugs and I would also note, by the past policies here in Seattle within the last ten years so putting a nod to our colleagues in the audience calling for direct call out for representation on the Advisory board here as well and I think again Councilmember Sara Nelson for her work to strike this right balance and for the Mayor's office for continuing to echo the importance of having the right balance from the get go.",101,,
494,0.97,4136.232,4145.274,That was their intention and this amendment really just brings more of that to light so we're all emphasizing to our community partners we're on the same page here.,101,,
495,0.97,4145.274,4150.88,"Councilmember Sara Nelson, follow up and I don't see additional hands so we go to a vote.",101,,
496,0.97,4150.88,4166.328,I just wanted to underscore the point you made that I forgot to make which is precisely it was public comment the first go around and that really did Hone our interest in this category.,102,,
497,0.97,4166.328,4166.662,Thank you.,103,,
498,0.97,4166.662,4170.399,And thanks to our staff as well.,103,,

523,0.97,4262.024,4275.437,The amendment simply again recognizes that the language as originally proposed did not have everybody at the table to who needs to be in these discussions.,119,,
524,0.97,4275.437,4296.925,We have community organizations that are doing amazing work around helping folks who have lived experiences in the war on drugs that are doing again amazing work helping people navigate.,119,,
525,0.97,4296.925,4331.493,Their Disentanglement with the criminal legal system and they really must be at the table when we are looking at how to move this work further specifically as it relates to the Ex-Spongement of records so this is an amendment that is intended to specify that the city will partner with King County as well as communities negatively impacted by the war on drugs and those with lived experience in the criminal justice system.,119,,

555,0.97,4482.878,4499.027,I really appreciate that we have found a path way forward on some of these items and I think that the legislation is stronger because of it.,133,,
556,0.97,4499.027,4513.642,So thank you for the work you have done on this legislation and I do want to thank the broad array of community partners continuing to testify in support.,133,,

561,0.97,4528.09,4531.56,I support the equitable goals of these three pieces of legislation.,134,,
562,0.97,4531.56,4539.234,Really a full package here for equity and I plan to support the other two pieces of legislation before us today.,134,,
563,0.97,4539.234,4585.147,"While I support numerous sections of this Council bill 120391 I'm concerned about how the bill was substantially modified and the neutrality of the needs assessment and the legislation from the Mayor's office has been changed and I don't think the amendment has made it better for the needs assessment, I believe a competitive request for proposals process should select an objective neutral academic institution so due to this substantial I need to vote no today Perhaps it can be further modified before the full council vote and while I'll be voting no on this bill I will vote yes for the other two pieces.",134,,
564,0.97,4585.147,4588.583,Okay.,135,,
565,0.97,4588.583,4591.386,Councilmember Sara Nelson please go ahead.,135,,
566,0.97,4591.386,4596.325,If I could say Dido to Councilmember Alex Pedersen I would.,136,,
567,0.97,4596.325,4624.786,"But basically I believe that yes, there are many good measures and I'm really sorry for having worked so diligently in such good faith with you on the make up of the advisory Council but I do believe that the voices of community were not heard in the formation of the needs assessment amendment.",136,,
568,0.97,4624.786,4647.576,And so I will be voting no on process grounds and perhaps that we can work together over the next month or so to work towards a needs assessment that's truly reflective of community needs and also neutral academic entities doing this work.,136,,
569,0.97,4647.576,4648.844,Councilmember Lisa Herbold go ahead.,137,,
570,0.97,4648.844,4667.462,"Thanks, I want to state for the record that we were told by the executive I believe Thomas and Dan Eder and they confirmed the process would be using for the needs assessment would not be a sole source contract and it would be the result of a competitive Rfp.",138,,
571,0.97,4667.462,4669.131,"That's important to note, for the record.",138,,
572,0.97,4669.131,4672.601,That was the commitment made to us in the last meeting.,138,,
573,0.97,4672.601,4675.037,"Thank you very much Councilmember, Lisa Herbold and that's correct.",139,,
574,0.97,4675.037,4677.039,I want to lift that up.,139,,
575,0.97,4677.039,4715.944,I specifically asked on the record even with the last amendment we had if this would be a competitive process that would be difference SHL to an Rfp through the Mayor's office and the answer was yes for Dan Eber so let the record show this is a neutral assessment of who gets to participate on the needs Aassessment and centering this with academic institutions insure organizations who have the work in this arena is very relevant and incredibly important to make sure that a needs assessment does include workers at the table as well as businesses so there's no hiding of the ball here.,139,,
576,0.97,4715.944,4755.917,"We are incredibly excited about the opportunity to bring people to the table to provide an assessment of what we need to do in this category and the rhetoric is frankly Di Visive, not helpful and already trying to pull communities apart that are already Disportion Natalie harmed by the war on drugs yes but also by being pulled apart within already diverse and complex situations where many business licenses have been removed from folks and many workers are in harm's way and we want to do everything we can to bring people together.",139,,
577,0.97,4755.917,4757.452,That's what it's all about.,139,,
578,0.97,4757.452,4762.457,With that we're ready to vote.,139,,
579,0.97,4762.457,4768.93,We have Council bill 120391 as amended in front of us any additional comments?,139,,

583,0.97,4776.204,4782.577,Glad that the competitive requests for proposal was put on the record.,141,,
584,0.97,4782.577,4788.483,"I was saying competitive requests for academic institutions only, that's what I meant.",141,,
585,0.97,4788.483,4798.894,And also the advisory committee is where everybody would be at the table so I'm glad to see that the advisory committee was included.,141,,
586,0.97,4798.894,4799.327,Thank you.,141,,
587,0.97,4799.327,4800.595,Thank you for your support.,142,,

589,0.97,4801.53,4814.376,"This is a follow up from Councilmember Lisa Herbold's point that Wez yes there's an Rfp but continuing with my line of questions, what Nonprofts are we talking about?",143,,
590,0.97,4814.376,4835.73,"If there aren't more than one nonprofit that is going to do this work, that is not competitive and I don't see how you do it an Rfp for one organization the way that organization or that nonprofit is described in the amendment.",143,,
591,0.97,4835.73,4840.769,So.,143,,
592,0.97,4840.769,4857.652,"We have to be honest when we talk about Partnering with a nonprofit I think we need to be transparent from the get go if we're going to say that, what Nonprofits are we talking about and are there enough to choose from?",144,,

641,0.97,5066.394,5085.513,This is providing a vehicle for me to forward something that speaks to the business license fee that I committed to a couple of years ago.,171,,
642,0.97,5086.281,5090.952,It was sponsored during the budget process some increases to business license fees.,171,,
643,0.97,5090.952,5099.461,We did not consider fully the equity implications of an increase of $3500 for all businesses.,171,,
644,0.97,5099.461,5112.54,At the time we asked FAS to consider a stepped approach.,171,,
645,0.97,5113.208,5120.548,I have been in touch with FAS over the last several years about the possibility of reducing some of the business license cost.,171,,
646,0.97,5120.548,5120.849,Two things.,171,,
647,0.97,5120.849,5126.221,"One, recognizing that all of these businesses are not equal.",171,,
648,0.97,5126.221,5141.069,"But also recognizing that there is work required by the city, as compared to licensing work required by the state.",171,,
649,0.97,5141.069,5154.816,"I'm really pleased that the bill, as introduced, includes a removal of both the $250 fee for processing inspections and the $200 fee for the license requirement fee.",171,,
650,0.97,5154.816,5174.469,My amendment is based on a proposal that FAS developed back in 2020 after their analysis conducted following the Council 2018 legislative intent.,171,,
651,0.97,5174.469,5189.117,-- coincides with 2000 square feet or less . It must comply with of the same requirements as all other marijuana businesses.,171,,
652,0.97,5189.117,5219.447,They are go on to say the best practices for regulatory fee setting allow a consideration of a--FAS legislative proposal was motivated that these practices allow a regulatory agency to consider its own administrative burden into account when setting fees.,171,,
653,0.97,5219.447,5229.424,"-- required to inspect transfer businesses, significantly less than other licensed marijuana businesses.",171,,
654,0.97,5229.424,5239.334,Fas imposes a reduced fee for the transporter classification.,171,,
655,0.97,5239.334,5240.969,There are only two clear licensees in Seattle.,171,,
656,0.97,5240.969,5248.776,There is currently no transporter business.,171,,
657,0.97,5248.776,5278.539,-- reduced fee for the classification as recommended by FAS . It establishes the feed to be $2000 for the smaller businesses as compared to 3500 and the impact is very slight because of the number of businesses that fall into the category.,171,,
658,0.97,5278.539,5279.44,Thank you.,171,,
659,0.97,5279.44,5283.945,"Thank you very much, council member Herbold.",172,,

682,0.97,5340.001,5360.922,Originally I had an amendment that would have given priority for a holder of medical marijuana licensing in the past but they lost them in the transition to recreation and licensing thereof.,184,,
683,0.97,5360.922,5381.042,I was running with that amendment because I believed that this was a piece of legislation that would be complementary but to build on the social equity criteria put forward by the state.,184,,
684,0.97,5381.042,5386.214,That is why I had that amendment in there.,184,,
685,0.97,5386.214,5390.251,"When Councilmember Herbold said, how would that be Operationalized, those come from the state.",184,,
686,0.97,5390.251,5401.028,It became clear that there really wasn't a way for this priority to be included in this package.,184,,
687,0.97,5401.028,5409.303,"So when I realize that this package is mostly about the changes that we were making to the cost of licenses, that is the reason why that was pulled.",184,,

711,0.97,5466.327,5475.903,This bill would require Cannabis business employers to take certain actions to increase transparency and reduce job insecurity caused by changes in ownership.,198,,
712,0.97,5475.903,5495.423,"First, to address transparency concerns, integrated enterprises to provide written notice the employees of the names used by any of their associated integrated enterprises.",198,,
713,0.97,5495.423,5499.861,This notice would be incorporated into the current notice of employment information obligations that employers already provide to their employees.,198,,
714,0.97,5499.861,5515.142,Two address job insecurity caused by changes in ownership of the Cannabis business the bill would require outgoing Cannabis business is being sold to provide a preferential hiring list to the incoming Cannabis business and post a notice of change in ownership at the Jobsite.,198,,

796,0.97,5930.958,5933.527,"Some of the reasons bad news is baked in, if you will.",215,,
797,0.97,5933.527,5948.442,"Just illustrate how inflation has taken off, how to become a dominant force, this graphic shows you, at least initially, this is the expected path of inflation when we give you a revenue forecast last November with the adopted budget.",215,,
798,0.97,5948.442,5951.478,They said inflation would peak at about 5% and would already be well in decline.,215,,
799,0.97,5951.478,5960.321,"That was revised when we did the April forecast . At that point, if you recall, inflation had spiked in January and February.",215,,
800,0.97,5960.321,5964.391,But still the expectation is that it would come down quickly.,215,,
801,0.97,5964.391,5967.494,That was a universal expectation at that time.,215,,
802,0.97,5967.494,5987.715,As we deliver the forecast the expectations and reality on inflation have shifted up and again we have national rates above 9% . notice that the continued expectation is that the actions of the Fed will work and inflation will drop relatively quickly.,215,,
803,0.97,5987.715,5991.018,We may have seen the first data point of that.,215,,
804,0.97,5991.018,5993.287,The number for July was below that for June.,215,,
805,0.97,5993.287,6012.339,"But the expectation is the actions of the Fed--by the middle of next year inflation will be back below 4% . again, that's consistent with the approach of the Feds.",215,,
806,0.97,6012.339,6016.01,The expectation is they will raise interest rates in some ways to make this so.,215,,
807,0.97,6016.01,6018.278,With potential implications for employment.,215,,
808,0.97,6018.278,6021.715,But that is the expectation and that is what is reflected in the forecast.,215,,
809,0.97,6021.715,6029.523,In terms of employment locally we have not reached full recovery from the pandemic.,215,,
810,0.97,6029.523,6037.731,But the Red line in this graphic shows a total number of jobs that remain lost relative to the Pre-Pandemic levels.,215,,
811,0.97,6037.731,6038.132,"20,000 jobs.",215,,
812,0.97,6038.132,6043.437,That's about 1% of the regional employment levels.,215,,
813,0.97,6043.437,6047.741,"The other thing this graphic shows you, and this is a really important point, the job recovery has been very uneven.",215,,
814,0.97,6047.741,6059.186,"If you look down to the bottom and to the right, professional services information, trade, which is a lot of the Online retail trade being represented there.",215,,
815,0.97,6059.186,6062.055,Those sectors have actually increased their total employment since the beginning of the pandemic.,215,,
816,0.97,6062.055,6064.057,We have been growing in those areas strongly.,215,,
817,0.97,6064.057,6077.137,"At the same time leisure, hospitality, manufacturing continue to lag.",215,,
818,0.97,6077.137,6080.073,"The hotel, restaurant, and other aspects of leisure and hospitality have not fully recovered.",215,,
819,0.97,6080.073,6084.478,The good news on that front.,215,,
820,0.97,6084.478,6085.913,The summer tourist season appears quite strong.,215,,
821,0.97,6085.913,6088.382,We have data from the number of visitors into the downtown area.,215,,
822,0.97,6088.382,6092.419,"Again, it's not back to Pre- pandemic levels but it is looking strong.",215,,
823,0.97,6092.419,6100.227,"We do have some concern, going forward, about the roll of the Tech sector and whether it will be as strong of a force.",215,,
824,0.97,6100.227,6110.237,"The Redline is showing employment growth in the trade, information, and professional business sectors, which capture the technology employment.",215,,
825,0.97,6110.237,6120.481,"What they show is, since 2011, we have seen five, six, 7% growth in employment in those sectors.",215,,
826,0.97,6120.481,6122.516,High-Paying jobs in those sectors.,215,,
827,0.97,6122.516,6130.591,The blue line is the growth and notes in the same job.,215,,
828,0.97,6130.591,6133.16,It has also been very strong.,215,,
829,0.97,6133.16,6134.495,Seattle is included in that blue line.,215,,
830,0.97,6134.495,6140.734,"What is apparent is we have been leading, the city has been leading that regional growth and employment . that is consistent.",215,,
831,0.97,6140.734,6141.468,We have seen this.,215,,
832,0.97,6141.468,6151.445,"We have seen Amazon, Facebook, apple, and the like, increasing their presence here in the city.",215,,
833,0.97,6151.445,6156.216,But there is an open question about whether that level of growth is sustained into the future.,215,,
834,0.97,6156.216,6160.654,There is at least some initial data and anecdotes that success otherwise.,215,,
835,0.97,6160.654,6166.727,The regional Council has employment down to a municipal level.,215,,
836,0.97,6166.727,6174.902,"When it shows, and 2021, that the first evidence of employment growth in the sectors has dropped off in the city.",215,,
837,0.97,6174.902,6177.037,And with it it has pulled the region down as well.,215,,
838,0.97,6177.037,6181.808,"Currently, because of the work from home issue and tracking employment by location is a tricky thing to do.",215,,
839,0.97,6181.808,6186.046,I would describe to you this preliminary data.,215,,
840,0.97,6186.046,6194.655,But they are consistent with the anecdotal information we have heard from large Tech employers about hiring Slowdowns or freezes.,215,,
841,0.97,6194.655,6200.827,And also their investments in facilities on the East side of the Lake.,215,,
842,0.97,6200.827,6206.333,"Think about the Seattle economy going forward, specific to the city, this information has certainly influence our thinking about long-term growth.",215,,
843,0.97,6206.333,6212.472,"And as you can see, growth in the payroll expense tax revenues.",215,,
844,0.97,6212.472,6215.442,A piece of the overall picture here.,215,,
845,0.97,6215.442,6219.746,Let's talk about the national and regional forecast looking forward.,215,,
846,0.97,6219.746,6224.818,What are folks predicting about the economy and how are those predictions changing in recent months?,215,,
847,0.97,6224.818,6232.793,"Again, this is a graphic that's designed to contract the national economy.",215,,
848,0.97,6232.793,6233.627,Specifically on the planet.,215,,
849,0.97,6233.627,6238.899,There are other Metrics you could use.,215,,
850,0.97,6238.899,6240.534,You would see similar patterns if you do.,215,,
851,0.97,6240.534,6243.403,"What you see here, again, this is the expectation in the forecast from October.",215,,
852,0.97,6243.403,6249.576,When we were developing a forecast that this year's budget was based on.,215,,
853,0.97,6249.576,6252.846,You can see there is a dramatic drop in on a planet since the pandemic.,215,,
854,0.97,6252.846,6258.352,The expectation was growth continuing modestly into the future.,215,,
855,0.97,6258.352,6265.392,"That was revised slightly, and only slightly when we brought you the April forecast.",215,,
856,0.97,6265.392,6268.462,What happened there is things are going a little better in the near-term.,215,,
857,0.97,6268.462,6271.565,So you can see the employment forecast went up at a national level.,215,,
858,0.97,6271.565,6275.569,That was approximately the same in the longer-term.,215,,
859,0.97,6275.569,6278.005,Things on the unemployment Úfront had been looking at.,215,,
860,0.97,6278.005,6291.785,The more recent forecasts indicate a slower recovery is expected into next year and beyond.,215,,
861,0.97,6291.785,6293.353,We are still seeing strong employment growth.,215,,
862,0.97,6293.353,6298.158,We mentioned those strong numbers from July.,215,,
863,0.97,6298.158,6313.707,Given that the Fed is working hard now to raise interest rates and cool things down in an effort to bring down inflation the expectation is that the job growth will be much more into 2024 and 2025.,215,,
864,0.97,6313.707,6315.742,You will see this effect in our revenue forecast.,215,,
865,0.97,6315.742,6317.344,"Again, on average, expectation of slower growth going forward.",215,,
866,0.97,6317.344,6325.686,The other issue that has emerged out of the national economy and in those forecasts is an increasing risk of a recession.,215,,
867,0.97,6325.686,6329.189,The National forecast gives us three scenarios.,215,,
868,0.97,6329.189,6333.794,"A baseline, and optimistic and pessimistic.",215,,
869,0.97,6333.794,6340.834,"The darker line here is that the forecast, again from July, the pessimistic scenario.",215,,
870,0.97,6340.834,6355.882,"Rather than seeing relatively weak but present job growth in the baseline forecast, in the pessimistic forecast we would see job loss as the economy would enter a recession.",215,,
871,0.97,6355.882,6366.993,"An important point is relative to our last forecast, the probability that is assigned to this possible scenario has increased.",215,,
872,0.97,6366.993,6371.965,They went from thinkin this could be a 35% probability to a 45% probability.,215,,
873,0.97,6371.965,6377.671,So in some sense they are showing us two scenarios and only putting us slightly higher improbability on the baseline.,215,,
874,0.97,6377.671,6383.276,Since then we have had strong job numbers.,215,,
875,0.97,6383.276,6389.816,Earlier this week we had a slightly revised forecast and the pessimistic scenario is not quite as bleak.,215,,
876,0.97,6389.816,6391.852,Nonetheless it's probability still holds a 45%.,215,,
877,0.97,6391.852,6401.495,"There's still a concern that, as the Fed takes action, we could tip into a recession environment.",215,,
878,0.97,6401.495,6407.868,If you look to the region you will see a similar story.,215,,
879,0.97,6407.868,6409.803,"That's employment, as we saw back in October.",215,,
880,0.97,6409.803,6416.676,It looked better in April.,215,,
881,0.97,6416.676,6421.148,"Again, in the near term we are seeing stronger job growth and the same expectation for the long run.",215,,
882,0.97,6421.148,6423.683,"But now, more recently, things have cooled some.",215,,
883,0.97,6423.683,6425.719,So we see slower job growth in the near-term.,215,,
884,0.97,6425.719,6426.953,And then again for the long run.,215,,
885,0.97,6426.953,6432.692,"It's important to note that the rate of job growth, relative to the nation, this is a regional forecast.",215,,
886,0.97,6432.692,6433.26,It's still strong.,215,,
887,0.97,6433.26,6438.231,We are still expecting the region to return to a period of growth and our growth has generally outpaced the national economy.,215,,
888,0.97,6438.231,6447.374,Two or three years out we are expecting a return to a pattern more similar to what we have seen Pre-Pandemic.,215,,
889,0.97,6447.374,6454.281,"Again, at a regional level this is showing what the pessimistic scenario looks like.",215,,
890,0.97,6454.281,6459.519,It too represents a significant recession and a drop in employment.,215,,
891,0.97,6459.519,6467.461,We are just now at about Pre- pandemic levels of employment.,215,,
892,0.97,6467.461,6469.83,This chart is measuring relative to the Pre-Pandemic levels.,215,,
893,0.97,6469.83,6477.637,If the pessimistic scenario were to emerge we would see layoffs again and regional employment drop.,215,,
894,0.97,6477.637,6479.84,Certainly not as badly as during the pandemic.,215,,
895,0.97,6479.84,6480.707,But notably as well.,215,,
896,0.97,6480.707,6486.246,We would take several years to recover.,215,,
897,0.97,6486.246,6494.054,I see there is a question.,215,,
898,0.97,6494.054,6494.888,Happy to wait.,216,,
899,0.97,6494.888,6495.789,I'm sorry.,216,,
900,0.97,6495.789,6504.931,No problem.,217,,
901,0.97,6504.931,6519.913,I want to stop a moment to talk about the recommendation we made among the scenarios and the actions that the forecast counsel to one of the key things we do is to make a recommendation about which of the scenarios should form the basis for the forecast.,218,,
902,0.97,6519.913,6525.185,"As I described, it's a difficult choice now with the probabilities assigned to each of the pessimistic and baseline are essentially the same.",218,,
903,0.97,6525.185,6533.26,"That said, and it's the reason I made the point earlier, the baseline forecast does incorporate a lot of the concerns that we have.",218,,
904,0.97,6533.26,6536.563,It anticipated the second quarterly decline in GDP.,218,,
905,0.97,6536.563,6542.035,"It anticipated the current actions of the Fed, which were really remarkable.",218,,
906,0.97,6542.035,6545.538,Two Three-Quarter point increases back to back.,218,,
907,0.97,6545.538,6547.908,Something we have not seen in decades.,218,,
908,0.97,6547.908,6553.914,But the baseline forecast anticipates further increases from the Fed.,218,,
909,0.97,6553.914,6558.652,It anticipated the current ones and is expecting them going forward.,218,,
910,0.97,6558.652,6559.653,There has been some good news.,218,,
911,0.97,6559.653,6566.66,Both on the job front and on the strong employment numbers for July.,218,,
912,0.97,6566.66,6568.628,The inflation figure did drop relative to June.,218,,
913,0.97,6568.628,6569.696,It's only one month.,218,,
914,0.97,6569.696,6571.598,Dangerous to assume a trend from that.,218,,
915,0.97,6571.598,6580.874,"Overall, those factors let us to be more comfortable with the baseline scenario and that was our recommendation to the forecast counsel.",218,,
916,0.97,6580.874,6586.112,They concurred on the recommendation at their August meeting.,218,,
917,0.97,6586.112,6592.185,"As I move now to talk about the revenues themselves, these are consistent with that baseline forecast that we showed you.",218,,
918,0.97,6592.185,6603.163,Which again has continued with more modest growth in both the regional and national economy.,218,,
919,0.97,6603.163,6611.137,Before I do the specifics of the revenue figures I want to make one more general point about inflation and the impact on general fund revenues.,218,,
920,0.97,6611.137,6620.547,"One might generally assume that prices are going up as inflation takes effect, that our revenue should grow with it.",218,,
921,0.97,6620.547,6632.292,Many of our taxes like sales tax and other things applied to the value of activity . and therefore our revenues would be going up with them.,218,,
922,0.97,6632.292,6635.328,What's tricky is that is not generally true of all of our revenue streams.,218,,
923,0.97,6635.328,6637.163,This pie chart is designed to illustrate that point.,218,,
924,0.97,6637.163,6643.47,The things in shades of yellow are in fact revenues that do generally grow with inflation.,218,,
925,0.97,6643.47,6650.91,I mentioned sales . those are percentage taxes on sales and general business activity.,218,,
926,0.97,6650.91,6657.417,Inflation itself may have an impact on total activities in those areas.,218,,
927,0.97,6657.417,6663.056,Our taxes will grow as the level of activity grows.,218,,
928,0.97,6663.056,6670.597,And private utilities are generally increasing their rates to cover their cost.,218,,
929,0.97,6670.597,6673.967,"It's reasonable to expect that our taxes on those, those services will also grow with inflation.",218,,
930,0.97,6673.967,6677.871,But it's critically important to understand that it's not true of all of our revenue sources.,218,,
931,0.97,6677.871,6688.048,"In particular, property tax, it's represents almost 25% of our revenues are constrained to grow at well less than current inflation.",218,,
932,0.97,6688.048,6692.318,"Property tax by state law can grow by 1%, plus the value of new construction.",218,,
933,0.97,6692.318,6698.058,"In recent years, maybe about 2 1/2%.",218,,
934,0.97,6698.058,6703.596,"When inflation was running at about 2 1/2%, that was okay.",218,,
935,0.97,6703.596,6705.198,We were not losing ground.,218,,
936,0.97,6705.198,6711.037,As inflation has spiked that share of our revenue stream is losing ground.,218,,
937,0.97,6711.037,6713.873,And it will continue to lose ground as long as inflation stays high.,218,,
938,0.97,6713.873,6720.447,The things that are in shades of green are portions of our revenue stream.,218,,
939,0.97,6720.447,6721.848,There is a mix here.,218,,
940,0.97,6721.848,6730.056,Some of these things do generally go up with inflation.,218,,
941,0.97,6730.056,6732.759,"It depends on the actions of the city Council, as well as others.",218,,
942,0.97,6732.759,6740.266,In particular the tax will increase as rates and demand increases.,218,,
943,0.97,6740.266,6756.683,"If efforts are taken to protect Ratepayers by keeping rate increases below inflation, and effective that can be to reduce general fund revenues.",218,,
944,0.97,6756.683,6761.187,It's not a reason to increase as rates but rather to understand what implications are in terms of our overall revenue growth.,218,,
945,0.97,6761.187,6771.865,"Similarly, the later green, again those are areas where the city is charging folks for one service or another, and those rates are set by policy.",218,,
946,0.97,6771.865,6776.903,"Again, you may want to be protecting folks of the impact of inflation by keeping the in low.",218,,
947,0.97,6776.903,6781.774,To a degree they may not be keeping up with inflation.,218,,
948,0.97,6781.774,6788.848,"The general point here is that, as inflation goes up there is a structural issue.",218,,
949,0.97,6788.848,6795.455,And the general fund will not inherently keep up and the purchasing power of the general fund will be declining.,218,,
950,0.97,6795.455,6801.361,"Again, the current forecast says inflation will come down quickly.",218,,
951,0.97,6801.361,6802.228,Hopefully that is the case.,218,,
952,0.97,6802.228,6804.597,If not this could become a bigger issue.,218,,
953,0.97,6804.597,6807.6,"It is, by the way, an underlying challenge for King County.",218,,
954,0.97,6807.6,6815.008,They have faced a series of budget challenges over the years.,218,,
955,0.97,6815.008,6819.612,That is because a greater share of their revenue is coming from property tax and they are not keeping up generally with inflation.,218,,
956,0.97,6819.612,6822.582,It's a structural challenge for them.,218,,
957,0.97,6822.582,6828.922,Let's talk about the revenue forecast and how things have changed.,218,,
958,0.97,6828.922,6834.06,"This is a chart that focuses just on this year, on 2022.",218,,
959,0.97,6834.06,6843.67,Highlighting the blue versus not blue is a distinction between the revenue streams in our forecast by the forecast office versus the budget office.,218,,
960,0.97,6843.67,6849.642,I'm going to speak to the things in blue and then turn it over to Dave and Alex to talk about things that are in white.,218,,
961,0.97,6849.642,6857.116,"Just in terms of reading the chart, the first column of numbers are the 21 Actuals.",218,,
962,0.97,6857.116,6857.951,As a reference point.,218,,
963,0.97,6857.951,6860.019,You can see how things change relative to that.,218,,
964,0.97,6860.019,6861.421,The second column is the adopted budget.,218,,
965,0.97,6861.421,6863.456,The forecasts that were made in November.,218,,
966,0.97,6863.456,6865.158,October and November.,218,,
967,0.97,6865.158,6872.298,April is a revised forecast from last time.,218,,
968,0.97,6872.298,6873.6,The August forecast is the most current.,218,,
969,0.97,6873.6,6875.401,Those of the numbers we are showing you today.,218,,
970,0.97,6875.401,6882.542,And the final column shows you the change between August and April.,218,,
971,0.97,6882.542,6887.547,I'm just going to work my way down this chart to give you a highlight.,218,,
972,0.97,6887.547,6890.917,Next slide we will show you 22 and 23.,218,,
973,0.97,6890.917,6892.252,Property taxes are generally predictable.,218,,
974,0.97,6892.252,6892.952,No real change here.,218,,
975,0.97,6892.952,6894.787,These are in the thousands.,218,,
976,0.97,6894.787,6897.09,That's 30 in the final column.,218,,
977,0.97,6897.09,6900.96,"It represents $30,000 of change.",218,,
978,0.97,6900.96,6903.263,"That is a minor, minor change in property taxes.",218,,
979,0.97,6903.263,6904.297,Retail sales are up.,218,,
980,0.97,6904.297,6914.908,Both reflecting the impact of inflation and price is being higher overall.,218,,
981,0.97,6914.908,6918.244,"As we showed you, the local economy did better in the near term than we had anticipated.",218,,
982,0.97,6918.244,6933.393,A decline in business and occupation tax is less a reflection of anything changing the economy and more that there have been changes in the way certain taxpayers shift from manual to quarterly payments.,218,,
983,0.97,6933.393,6937.463,This made it a little challenging for us to track the baseline.,218,,
984,0.97,6937.463,6941.935,This is really us getting a better handle on the baseline revenues.,218,,
985,0.97,6941.935,6944.27,You will see that does ripple into the future.,218,,
986,0.97,6944.27,6945.605,Private utility side.,218,,
987,0.97,6945.605,6955.014,A small change . natural gas prices have pushed that up somewhat.,218,,
988,0.97,6955.014,6962.388,The Cable forecast is up slightly as well.,218,,
989,0.97,6962.388,6972.465,"I'm going to shift now and turn this over to Dave and Alex to talk about these other revenue streams and that I will return at the end to talk about the final line, which is a significant one in this table.",218,,
990,0.97,6972.465,6973.166,Thank you.,219,,
991,0.97,6973.166,6973.533,Good morning.,219,,
992,0.97,6973.533,6974.067,It's still morning.,219,,
993,0.97,6974.067,6982.075,"Utility taxes, the public utility tax, water, sewage, solid waste.",219,,
994,0.97,6982.075,6983.71,We have seen a slight decline.,219,,
995,0.97,6983.71,6990.249,The decline is really a combination of facts from the various utility funds.,219,,
996,0.97,6990.249,6999.058,"But the big movers, Seattle city light is up a bit.",219,,
997,0.97,6999.058,7002.128,They're selling more retail electricity than previously thought in April.,219,,
998,0.97,7002.128,7014.507,The big Mover is watered down because we have had such a cool spring . water usage was less.,219,,
999,0.97,7014.507,7017.377,They have revised that forecast down for that that change of about $1 million.,219,,
1000,0.97,7017.377,7021.814,"Other city taxes, these are things like the excise tax.",219,,
1001,0.97,7021.814,7026.219,A ton of taxes--solid waste.,219,,
1002,0.97,7026.219,7028.187,"Heating, oil, things like this.",219,,
1003,0.97,7028.187,7034.627,You can see that there is a decline of about $2 million.,219,,
1004,0.97,7034.627,7043.436,That is largely comprised of reductions and the heating oil tax in April.,219,,
1005,0.97,7043.436,7051.21,We had it carrying on but you all had changed it so that it was not effective until 2023.,219,,
1006,0.97,7051.21,7063.022,"We removed about $780,000 from 2022.",219,,
1007,0.97,7063.523,7064.857,The excise taxes were up a bit.,219,,
1008,0.97,7064.857,7068.928,The net effect there is about a $2 million decline overall.,219,,
1009,0.97,7068.928,7070.363,Parking meters are up $1.5 million.,219,,
1010,0.97,7070.363,7073.199,This is largely due to the rates still climbing.,219,,
1011,0.97,7073.199,7089.015,Still being moved forward by the slow but steady process of evaluating paid occupancy and raising rates in the areas and neighborhoods where it is warranted.,219,,
1012,0.97,7089.015,7093.152,They have a few of those rate evaluations scheduled for this year.,219,,
1013,0.97,7093.152,7099.692,And this forecast includes those potential increases.,219,,
1014,0.97,7099.692,7105.898,This is not a projection . It's an actual fact.,219,,
1015,0.97,7105.898,7111.404,It is at or near Pre-Pandemic levels.,219,,
1016,0.97,7111.404,7114.574,There's a lot of areas that will be increased because they are already at those levels.,219,,
1017,0.97,7114.574,7120.613,They will go from there.,219,,
1018,0.97,7120.613,7123.516,Court finds is an interesting and complicated story.,219,,
1019,0.97,7123.516,7126.385,Citation volumes for parking citations are maintaining.,219,,
1020,0.97,7126.385,7131.491,Those are the ones written by parking enforcement officers.,219,,
1021,0.97,7131.491,7134.494,"Those are at Pre-Pandemic levels of about 550,000.",219,,
1022,0.97,7134.494,7147.44,"Other citations for driving while intoxicated or moving violations, those are down.",219,,
1023,0.97,7147.44,7148.708,They are generated by patrol officers.,219,,
1024,0.97,7148.708,7153.112,"As you are aware, there is staffing and Prioritization questions going on there.",219,,
1025,0.97,7153.112,7157.65,So those revenues are down from those types of citations.,219,,
1026,0.97,7157.65,7166.826,"And then we had the situation with the voiding of 200,000 citations and the refunds being given for those.",219,,
1027,0.97,7166.826,7169.195,The court numbers in 2020 to reflect that reduction.,219,,
1028,0.97,7169.195,7181.974,"And then there are other forecasting adjustments that we have made to reflect payment, expectations.",219,,
1029,0.97,7181.974,7189.882,There is an accounting adjustment of sorts of about $3.3 million here.,219,,
1030,0.97,7189.882,7202.461,"By counting rules, it was incorporating it into the revenues . an amount that reflected a portion of unpaid citations that would be in collections.",219,,
1031,0.97,7202.461,7204.897,We have determined that is not actually a cash revenue.,219,,
1032,0.97,7204.897,7213.139,We are moving that from the forecast.,219,,
1033,0.97,7213.139,7215.975,"It is not a dollars available to spend, it's a projection for County purposes.",219,,
1034,0.97,7215.975,7219.145,It will affect the balance sheet but not the cash available.,219,,
1035,0.97,7219.145,7219.445,Moving on.,219,,
1036,0.97,7219.445,7223.382,Grants.,219,,
1037,0.97,7223.382,7224.617,The $39.9 million change there.,219,,
1038,0.97,7224.617,7231.157,This is largely due to us.,219,,
1039,0.97,7231.157,7237.73,Including the carrying forward and things like that into the grant category.,219,,
1040,0.97,7237.73,7240.466,I don't know if you wanted to say more about that in your remarks.,219,,
1041,0.97,7240.466,7248.207,You will see a line down below that is for grants and legislative changes of about 40.7 million in April.,219,,
1042,0.97,7248.207,7254.08,Those are being added to April because we failed to include those carryforward grants into the April number.,219,,
1043,0.97,7254.08,7256.949,But they are included in the August numbers.,219,,
1044,0.97,7256.949,7259.552,To try to present an apples to apples comparison here.,219,,
1045,0.97,7259.552,7261.721,We have that sort of presented on two different lines.,219,,
1046,0.97,7261.721,7268.861,"The bottom line, right above the shaded blue line, and then in the grant category.",219,,
1047,0.97,7268.861,7281.04,Fund balance transfers . This is largely due to a $4.3 million change in where we are posting a transfer.,219,,
1048,0.97,7281.04,7282.341,This is Crf money.,219,,
1049,0.97,7282.341,7285.511,It was scheduled to be booked into the general fund.,219,,
1050,0.97,7285.511,7292.718,Instead it has been booked directly into the Hsd Fund.,219,,
1051,0.97,7292.718,7293.886,"Licensing, permits, and others.",219,,
1052,0.97,7293.886,7297.156,Not much change there.,219,,
1053,0.97,7297.156,7299.425,I just explained the carryforward and grant line item.,219,,
1054,0.97,7299.425,7304.597,"Then, do you want to talk about payroll expense tax?",219,,
1055,0.97,7304.597,7311.57,"I have the entry for payroll tax, late 2021 payroll tax payments.",220,,
1056,0.97,7311.57,7317.209,What has happened here is the payroll tax first came into effect for 2021.,220,,
1057,0.97,7317.209,7320.479,Payments were due in January of this year.,220,,
1058,0.97,7320.479,7321.681,A one-time annual payment.,220,,
1059,0.97,7321.681,7325.518,This year folks are making orderly estimated payments.,220,,
1060,0.97,7325.518,7335.661,It's apparent that the number of firms were struggling to come into compliance and understand how they were affected by the tax.,220,,
1061,0.97,7335.661,7339.598,We have continued to get payments for 2021 obligations through this year.,220,,
1062,0.97,7339.598,7341.6,And as recently as last month.,220,,
1063,0.97,7341.6,7345.738,Even this month.,220,,
1064,0.97,7345.738,7357.983,"In total we have collected an additional $42 million in 2021 payments . as a technical matter, an accounting matter, they have to be recorded as 2022 revenues.",220,,
1065,0.97,7357.983,7360.286,Because they come in as late as they have.,220,,
1066,0.97,7360.286,7369.161,City ordinance dictates the 2021 payroll expense revenues go into the general fund.,220,,
1067,0.97,7369.161,7373.532,"As shown here, General fund revenues.",220,,
1068,0.97,7373.532,7382.274,"Going forward, the payroll expense tax for 2022 and beyond are in their own separate Fund.",220,,
1069,0.97,7382.274,7387.446,These are being directed into the general fund.,220,,
1070,0.97,7387.446,7394.82,From that perspective there are one-time general fund resources . The payroll expense will show you that going forward.,220,,
1071,0.97,7394.82,7397.089,Going forward it will be into the general fund.,220,,
1072,0.97,7397.089,7406.065,"This doesn't imply, in April we told you the final numbers for the payroll expense tax and 2021, about $248 million.",220,,
1073,0.97,7406.065,7414.807,With this it turns out the actual total payments for 2021 are closer to 200 or just above $290 million.,220,,
1074,0.97,7414.807,7421.213,Understanding that is the base is affecting our forecast.,220,,
1075,0.97,7421.213,7423.616,You will see we have significant concern at this point.,220,,
1076,0.97,7423.616,7427.119,We don't expect to match that figure in 2021 or 2022.,220,,
1077,0.97,7427.119,7431.056,We will explain why.,220,,
1078,0.97,7431.056,7435.594,"For this year, this is a very significant increase in revenues one time.",220,,
1079,0.97,7435.594,7446.505,"As you can see, adding up the total on the far right column has helped to significantly offset some of the reductions we are seeing relative to the April forecast.",220,,
1080,0.97,7446.505,7447.139,So that's 2022.,220,,
1081,0.97,7447.139,7448.908,Looking ahead to 2023 and 2024.,220,,
1082,0.97,7448.908,7451.477,Let me Orient you on this table.,220,,
1083,0.97,7451.477,7459.418,The first column here of figures is the revised forecast for 2022 for this year.,220,,
1084,0.97,7459.418,7463.088,But there is reference see can see how things change from year to year.,220,,
1085,0.97,7463.088,7465.391,In the center section we are looking at the 2023 forecast.,220,,
1086,0.97,7465.391,7468.461,The initial forecast from April.,220,,
1087,0.97,7468.461,7473.766,The second is the revised for the new numbers for 2023.,220,,
1088,0.97,7473.766,7476.101,"And then again, the difference here on the right.",220,,
1089,0.97,7476.101,7481.574,That center portion.,220,,
1090,0.97,7481.574,7484.243,"On the right side of the table, the same information for 2024.",220,,
1091,0.97,7484.243,7489.381,"The April forecast, the revised August forecast.",220,,
1092,0.97,7489.381,7490.449,It's a relatively high clip.,220,,
1093,0.97,7490.449,7499.225,I will go through and talk about the changes from the forecast office perspective and then turned to Dave on the others.,220,,
1094,0.97,7499.225,7500.526,"Again, property tax, only small changes.",220,,
1095,0.97,7500.526,7503.963,It grows at 1% plus its value.,220,,
1096,0.97,7503.963,7507.633,Those things are not a very stable forecast.,220,,
1097,0.97,7507.633,7522.147,We are seeing somewhat higher new construction than what we had anticipated because the concrete strike did not have as much of a downward effect as we thought it might.,220,,
1098,0.97,7522.147,7525.084,Retail sales are up in nominal terms for 2023.,220,,
1099,0.97,7525.084,7527.319,"2024, a reduction relative to April.",220,,
1100,0.97,7527.319,7536.161,As we saw the longer-term forecast showed that the atomic economy grows less than we had anticipated back in April.,220,,
1101,0.97,7536.161,7537.229,This is an occupation tax.,220,,
1102,0.97,7537.229,7541.467,"Again, we have come to a better understanding of what the base is.",220,,
1103,0.97,7541.467,7542.701,It's consistent with what we saw before.,220,,
1104,0.97,7542.701,7552.978,And the lower growth is consistent with the revised regional forecast that shows an overall cooling.,220,,
1105,0.97,7552.978,7555.481,"Revit utility taxes, again, up somewhat.",220,,
1106,0.97,7555.481,7558.817,Natural gas is a big piece of that.,220,,
1107,0.97,7558.817,7566.492,Also Cable is holding up better than we thought.,220,,
1108,0.97,7566.492,7575.534,The overall patterns that we see in 2022 continue into 2023 and 2024.,220,,
1109,0.97,7575.534,7577.503,Acknowledging slower overall growth.,220,,
1110,0.97,7577.503,7577.703,Dave?,220,,
1111,0.97,7577.703,7579.838,Thank you.,221,,
1112,0.97,7579.838,7587.78,I would reiterate that point for the forecasted amounts to.,221,,
1113,0.97,7587.78,7591.884,"A lot of those amounts, we have adjusted the base in 2022.",221,,
1114,0.97,7591.884,7593.385,A lot of the same factors apply.,221,,
1115,0.97,7593.385,7594.119,That is carrying across.,221,,
1116,0.97,7594.119,7601.293,"The one I would like to point out is licenses, permits, and interest income.",221,,
1117,0.97,7601.293,7605.13,That is a drop of about $3.3 million each year.,221,,
1118,0.97,7605.13,7631.056,"That is largely due to changes in business license expectations . Then there is a reduction in emergency services reimbursements coming to you was the police Department now, I'm Blanking on the name.",221,,
1119,0.97,7631.056,7633.826,That's a decision they are making about how to use those resources.,221,,
1120,0.97,7633.826,7635.828,There is a reduction there.,221,,
1121,0.97,7635.828,7642.768,There are some lesser adjustments as well.,221,,
1122,0.97,7642.768,7653.779,Assumed commercial parking licenses and then a slight decline in interest earnings based on expectations of lowering cash balances for the general fund.,221,,
1123,0.97,7653.779,7667.359,I'm going to encourage us to get to pages 18 and 19 so that we can get into questions.,222,,
1124,0.97,7667.359,7672.931,That will leave us with about 45 minutes for the last presentation as well.,222,,
1125,0.97,7672.931,7688.547,"I want to think the folks from the city budget office as well who have offered to come to our next meeting on September 7th to do a report out on our American rescue plan, Seattle rescue plan expenses.",222,,
1126,0.97,7688.547,7695.454,"We will add that item to our agenda for September 7th, which just leaves us with concluding this item, agenda item number four.",222,,
1127,0.97,7695.454,7703.328,We have spent the last 45 minutes on the agenda number five.,222,,
1128,0.97,7703.328,7708.834,This is a reduction of about 16 1/2 million for the forecast and just over 11 million for the 2024 forecast.,223,,
1129,0.97,7708.834,7715.541,The only other point I would make about this graphic is the percentage change at the very bottom.,223,,
1130,0.97,7715.541,7715.908,Annual growth.,223,,
1131,0.97,7715.908,7723.449,Just highlighting that relative to 2022 2023 we actually had a reduction in resources in general.,223,,
1132,0.97,7723.449,7731.123,It is principally this one.,223,,
1133,0.97,7731.123,7731.957,The fund balance transfer.,223,,
1134,0.97,7731.957,7733.392,The 2022 budget relies significantly on transfers.,223,,
1135,0.97,7733.392,7735.027,That's not going to necessarily continue into 2023.,223,,
1136,0.97,7735.027,7736.628,It is creating some challenges.,223,,
1137,0.97,7736.628,7746.972,"Shift really quick here to talk about the other revenues that we have forecasted that are not in the general Fund, both which are significant.",223,,
1138,0.97,7746.972,7748.841,The largest of those is the payroll expense tax.,223,,
1139,0.97,7748.841,7751.21,I will spend a little bit of time here.,223,,
1140,0.97,7751.21,7760.119,"As I indicated, the 2021 Actuals, as we understood them at the time, or 248 million.",223,,
1141,0.97,7760.119,7766.892,As indicated that is an additional $42 million paid in.,223,,
1142,0.97,7766.892,7774.266,"The base for the payroll tax, as we understand for 2021, is $290 million.",223,,
1143,0.97,7774.266,7776.535,The forecast that we had for 2022 was less than that.,223,,
1144,0.97,7776.535,7777.336,It was 277 million.,223,,
1145,0.97,7777.336,7781.54,But that was a forecast that was based on almost no information at the time.,223,,
1146,0.97,7781.54,7784.309,We knew the numbers.,223,,
1147,0.97,7784.309,7787.379,We had seen any payments for 2022.,223,,
1148,0.97,7787.379,7791.083,We have now seen quarterly payments from the first and second quarter.,223,,
1149,0.97,7791.083,7797.222,Those are just not keeping pace with the 2021 figures.,223,,
1150,0.97,7797.222,7807.266,The forecast that we had for 2022 is actually somewhat higher than the revised forecast.,223,,
1151,0.97,7807.266,7808.867,Somewhat higher than what we had in April.,223,,
1152,0.97,7808.867,7811.336,But we got there in a very different way.,223,,
1153,0.97,7811.336,7816.508,We now understand that to the base is bigger than we thought but the payments for 2022 will be less than they were in 2021.,223,,
1154,0.97,7816.508,7819.344,In a minute we will talk about why that is the case.,223,,
1155,0.97,7819.344,7821.847,"Otherwise the admissions tax, only a very small change.",223,,
1156,0.97,7821.847,7826.618,"Real estate excise tax, good performance in the first half.",223,,
1157,0.97,7826.618,7828.887,Upping that forecast for the rest of this year.,223,,
1158,0.97,7828.887,7836.862,And then the sales tax just follows the overall sales tax forecast.,223,,
1159,0.97,7836.862,7839.431,I'm going to do these real quick.,223,,
1160,0.97,7839.431,7846.638,Minor changes just based on current performance.,223,,
1161,0.97,7846.638,7849.608,The payroll expense tax.,223,,
1162,0.97,7849.608,7857.449,You will see that the forecast is somewhat lower than what we showed you in April.,223,,
1163,0.97,7857.449,7870.062,"We are not going to hit the same level of activity in 2021, given the forecast we have seen we are expecting less job growth in the sectors that are principally responsible.",223,,
1164,0.97,7870.062,7871.396,We are expecting somewhat slower growth.,223,,
1165,0.97,7871.396,7875.334,That your is relatively small but that's what driving.,223,,
1166,0.97,7875.334,7881.673,"The real estate excise tax, just jumping ahead to an area of significant change.",223,,
1167,0.97,7881.673,7883.442,We saw strong performance in 2022.,223,,
1168,0.97,7883.442,7900.158,We expect left net revenue in 2023 and 2024 as interest rates start to cool the real estate market.,223,,
1169,0.97,7900.158,7902.427,We are still not anticipating to reach the current levels.,223,,
1170,0.97,7902.427,7906.465,"I think the commercial parking tax, in terms of other changes.",223,,
1171,0.97,7906.465,7921.847,"Commercial parking tax is primarily reflecting what is going on with the new regional economic outlook, which has been revised down from April, particularly starting in 2023.",224,,
1172,0.97,7921.847,7933.926,"We are expecting that activity to return to Pre-Pandemic levels, just at a slower pace.",224,,
1173,0.97,7933.926,7943.969,"As last point, some other further comments about the payroll expense tax and why it is forecasting less revenue in 2022 then we saw in 2021.",225,,
1174,0.97,7943.969,7945.904,It was a base of $290 million.,225,,
1175,0.97,7945.904,7950.342,We are forecasting $278 million for next year.,225,,
1176,0.97,7950.342,7961.086,"One of the reasons for that, again we are seeing lower payments for the first two quarters this year.",225,,
1177,0.97,7961.086,7965.357,We think a significant expedition if that is the stock values of the large Tech companies declining.,225,,
1178,0.97,7965.357,7973.966,A lot of the compensation that is paid to folks in these companies is based on stock grants . The value of those grants are declining.,225,,
1179,0.97,7973.966,7993.185,"Another issue that we are monitoring is the way people sign workers to offices and the impact of work from home, which also reduces tax obligations.",225,,
1180,0.97,7993.185,7995.153,We spent a lot of time thinking about this.,225,,
1181,0.97,7995.153,7996.922,We don't have a ton of data.,225,,
1182,0.97,7996.922,8010.535,This forecast is one that is more a judgment call that it is based on hard data.,225,,
1183,0.97,8039.297,8042.601,Apologies for the feedback.,226,,
1184,0.97,8042.601,8044.002,"Counselor Herbold, you had your hand raised.",226,,
1185,0.97,8044.002,8045.203,Please go ahead.,226,,
1186,0.97,8045.203,8052.377,Thank you.,227,,
1187,0.97,8052.377,8060.986,"A question about the continued use of the baseline economic scenario, as we heard in your report.",227,,
1188,0.97,8060.986,8076.334,The probability of the pessimistic forecast has increased from a 35% probability in April to a 45% probability just a few short months later in August.,227,,
1189,0.97,8076.334,8084.576,Despite that shift the forecast continues to use the baseline forecast.,227,,
1190,0.97,8084.576,8088.28,You guys are the experts in this work.,227,,
1191,0.97,8088.28,8090.882,I pursue this line of questioning in the past.,227,,
1192,0.97,8090.882,8096.888,Your forecasting has been on the mark.,227,,
1193,0.97,8096.888,8115.273,"I'm just wondering, from a matter of practice, is there percentage of probability that forecasting experts use to shift from a baseline to a pessimistic? is it 1% over 50%?",227,,
1194,0.97,8115.273,8118.376,Really good question.,228,,
1195,0.97,8118.376,8125.183,"The way the National forecast works, the pessimistic forecast will never be above 51.",228,,
1196,0.97,8125.183,8127.486,It would then become the baseline.,228,,
1197,0.97,8127.486,8129.621,By construct.,228,,
1198,0.97,8129.621,8132.958,I didn't understand that.,229,,
1199,0.97,8132.958,8139.498,"We have employed the pessimistic forecast in the past, in particular, most recently in the beginning of 2020.",230,,
1200,0.97,8139.498,8143.235,When the pandemic hit.,230,,
1201,0.97,8143.235,8145.937,At the time there were two particular reasons for that.,230,,
1202,0.97,8145.937,8154.279,"One is, we were hit first if you recall.",230,,
1203,0.97,8154.279,8155.213,These were not reflecting our risks.,230,,
1204,0.97,8155.213,8157.048,We were in a different situation.,230,,
1205,0.97,8157.048,8161.286,In retrospect we also responded more aggressively.,230,,
1206,0.97,8161.286,8166.892,That was a reason to use our pessimistic forecast from a public health perspective.,230,,
1207,0.97,8166.892,8167.926,It was hard to know then.,230,,
1208,0.97,8167.926,8177.435,The other concern was that the components of our economy were potentially more impacted by the pandemic than the nation as a whole.,230,,
1209,0.97,8177.435,8183.708,The idea was that the National baseline was not reflective of our risks then.,230,,
1210,0.97,8183.708,8189.648,We don't have that sense now.,230,,
1211,0.97,8189.648,8194.352,We are feeling that our exposure was not unlike that of the nation.,230,,
1212,0.97,8194.352,8195.387,I harp on it earlier.,230,,
1213,0.97,8195.387,8198.39,The baseline forecast is also not a rosy one.,230,,
1214,0.97,8198.39,8213.438,"It is anticipated . If they have not anticipated the GDP decline, if they hadn't anticipated the rate increases, so the baseline was not reflective of current conditions.",230,,
1215,0.97,8213.438,8215.64,That would have been a reason Úto shift away.,230,,
1216,0.97,8215.64,8223.248,But it is reflective . a discussion related to this that we had with the forecast counsel is that we are going to continue to watch this.,230,,
1217,0.97,8223.248,8230.622,"We are for sure going to give you an update of the meeting in November, late October or beginning of November.",230,,
1218,0.97,8230.622,8240.031,"But if things were to change dramatically and the implication was a downward revision in the forecast, that's something that we might want to bring to you earlier.",230,,
1219,0.97,8240.031,8253.178,As a Deliberative body to the city Council and engage in discussion to potentially respond as you engage in the budget process and not have to make changes at the very last if you will.,230,,
1220,0.97,8253.178,8255.48,We are going to continue to keep an eye on that.,230,,
1221,0.97,8255.48,8266.057,If things deteriorate further we will reach back before November and work out some Timelines about when we can begin some of that work in mid September or early October if that proves appropriate.,230,,
1222,0.97,8266.057,8271.896,Responding to exactly the question and scenario that you are concerned about.,230,,
1223,0.97,8271.896,8274.232,Thank you.,231,,
1224,0.97,8274.232,8279.971,Thank you very much.,232,,
1225,0.97,8279.971,8281.206,I am not seeing additional questions.,232,,
1226,0.97,8281.206,8284.809,"I know this is just the precursor, the grounding for the next item on the agenda.",232,,
1227,0.97,8284.809,8289.547,I want to thank director noble and my colleagues as well.,232,,
1228,0.97,8289.547,8297.255,This is the conversation that has really focused on the revenue projections.,232,,
1229,0.97,8297.255,8302.727,The next item on our agenda is the overall health of the general fund.,232,,
1230,0.97,8302.727,8306.965,And a preview for the fall budget where we have the general fund financial plan item on our agenda.,232,,
1231,0.97,8306.965,8312.737,So please keep your questions for director noble focused on the revenue projections only.,232,,
1232,0.97,8312.737,8315.44,I see one more question from Councilmember Pedersen before we move on.,232,,
1233,0.97,8315.44,8316.641,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",233,,
1234,0.97,8316.641,8319.444,And thank you for this presentation.,233,,
1235,0.97,8319.444,8347.439,"I appreciate you breaking out the recent history of the new Jumpstart payroll tax and the difference in what was part of the general fund when we created a separate fund for the payroll tax . in terms of what would be the baseline for that payroll tax, I guess what I'm looking to is the expectation.",233,,
1236,0.97,8347.439,8350.041,I just want to confirm my numbers here.,233,,
1237,0.97,8350.041,8351.876,2022 adopted budget.,233,,
1238,0.97,8351.876,8361.519,So we adopted this in November.,233,,
1239,0.97,8361.519,8373.231,That was about $233 million was what we adopted last November as our estimate for the Jumpstart revenues.,233,,
1240,0.97,8373.231,8373.631,Is that correct?,233,,
1241,0.97,8373.631,8374.566,233 million.,233,,
1242,0.97,8374.566,8380.538,I had $234 million.,234,,
1243,0.97,8380.538,8385.51,I was trying to ground myself in the expectations of how much we would be getting.,235,,
1244,0.97,8385.51,8393.485,It sounds like we are exceeding that . exceeding it for different reasons.,235,,
1245,0.97,8393.485,8403.361,There's good news on that front at least.,235,,
1246,0.97,8403.361,8409.768,2021 outperformed our forecast.,236,,
1247,0.97,8409.768,8426.451,Certainly it was good news . The extra effort is to explain why we are convinced that will continue into the future . Even this year's revenues won't match last year's.,236,,
1248,0.97,8426.451,8443.201,The key data point for that is that halfway through the year we are seeing that it is on a pace to match the payments from last year and we are trying to understand why that is the case what we see is stock value change.,236,,
1249,0.97,8443.201,8452.21,W also see a shift to a model where people are only reporting the average work in the city and not assuming the real employment is happening in the city.,236,,
1250,0.97,8452.21,8455.213,Your estimate for 2023 is higher than $223 million.,237,,
1251,0.97,8455.213,8460.385,Adopted.,237,,
1252,0.97,8460.385,8465.523,We were off on the base.,238,,
1253,0.97,8465.523,8475.633,We are expected to grow to 230 million this year.,238,,
1254,0.97,8475.633,8479.737,We were expecting it to fall slightly this year and then modestly grow after that.,238,,
1255,0.97,8479.737,8484.042,We also know that we don't have a good handle on this revenue stream.,238,,
1256,0.97,8484.042,8490.415,"For instance, the stock value is driving compensation.",238,,
1257,0.97,8490.415,8491.883,Really good at predicting stock values.,238,,
1258,0.97,8491.883,8493.017,They might have a different job.,238,,
1259,0.97,8493.017,8495.587,That's going to be a challenge going forward.,238,,
1260,0.97,8495.587,8498.89,"Again, with every year and every quarter we gain a better understanding of how this works.",238,,
1261,0.97,8498.89,8504.596,This is a really good setting . your point is well taken.,239,,
1262,0.97,8504.596,8508.066,I think it will be a good Segue into the upcoming presentation from central staff as well.,239,,
1263,0.97,8508.066,8525.183,I want to encourage folks . If they would like additional details we did walk through this in about 2 1/2 hours in our revenue forecast council meeting last Monday.,239,,
1264,0.97,8525.183,8528.286,So that information is also Archived on the Seattle Channel from the eighth of August.,239,,
1265,0.97,8528.286,8534.826,Thank you very much to the office of economic revenue and forecast . This is a helpful ground setting as we move on to the next agenda item.,239,,
1266,0.97,8534.826,8539.163,"Madam clerk, please read item number five and the record.",239,,
1267,0.97,8539.163,8546.971,Agenda item number five.,240,,
1268,0.97,8546.971,8548.806,General fund financial plan update for briefing and discussion.,240,,
1269,0.97,8548.806,8559.317,"Thank you so much, Madam",241,,
1270,0.97,8565.523,8569.193,Office of economic revenue forecast.,242,,
1271,0.97,8569.327,8571.829,Painted a pretty good picture from April and August forecast.,242,,
1272,0.97,8571.829,8576.968,The changes in the forecast are going to have a significant impact on the available revenue to the city.,242,,
1273,0.97,8576.968,8588.98,"As the Mayor considers drafting his budget and transmitting that to Council, we are very interested in working together to make sure that we have a solid financial plan to address the growing needs in this city.",242,,
1274,0.97,8588.98,8594.686,And also to make sure that we have the revenue to fulfill those needs.,242,,
1275,0.97,8594.686,8605.363,"Colleagues, we're about to see an overall picture of how our budget, over the course of the next several years, will work with the assumptions from the revenue forecast information that was presented last week.",242,,
1276,0.97,8605.363,8628.386,"Again, I want to thank, not only office of revenue forecast but also the city budget's office and our own central staff who have been diligently working over the last week and a half to look at the forecast information, factor in our expenses from the city, and look towards how we're creating a more Stannable, stable and transparent budget.",242,,
1277,0.97,8628.386,8647.271,"So today's conversation will have an opportunity to ask questions at the end of the presentation, and I am going to also save my comments about how I am looking at various solutions to addressing the budget deficit, that is going to be outlined here in the central staff's presentation, after they conclude their comments.",242,,
1278,0.97,8647.271,8668.026,"We know that the looming budget discussion that we will have in just over a month from now, is the biggest issue many of us are working on collectively addressing to make sure that we close this gap and provide critical services to our community residents, small business workers and to Inn sure that we're investing in the growth of our local economy as well.",242,,
1279,0.97,8668.026,8674.265,"Because the legislative branch holds the purse, we have the final say on the proposed budget for the upcoming years.",242,,
1280,0.97,8674.265,8678.302,We will also be very interested in not only the presentation in front of us today.,242,,
1281,0.97,8678.302,8698.556,"But I want to make sure that we are setting an important course for how we continue to try to address this, in the most humane and humanitarian way possible to make sure we not only prevent against austerity, but make Keyinvestment into our economy, workers and small businesses.",242,,
1282,0.97,8698.556,8702.427,"With that, if I turn it over to central staff to walk us through the financial plan.",242,,
1283,0.97,8702.427,8714.639,"This is a general fund revenue update, and the financial plan, as presented by our city budget office and central staff.",242,,
1284,0.97,8714.639,8716.307,Stow Aly Penucci are here now.,242,,
1285,0.97,8716.307,8721.279,And we also have Julie Dingley for maybe input as well.,242,,
1286,0.97,8721.279,8723.448,And any questions folks have.,242,,
1287,0.97,8723.448,8726.15,"Please go ahead, Tom and ally.",242,,
1288,0.97,8726.15,8727.485,Thank you.,243,,
1289,0.97,8727.485,8734.358,I'm just going to go share my screen.,243,,
1290,0.97,8734.358,8735.46,For you seeing my presentation.,243,,
1291,0.97,8735.46,8736.761,We are.,244,,
1292,0.97,8736.761,8739.03,Great.,245,,
1293,0.97,8739.03,8739.697,Good morning.,245,,
1294,0.97,8739.697,8745.736,I'm Aweather Y Penucci and joined by my colleagues.,245,,
1295,0.97,8745.736,8755.947,I'm going to jump in and make sure we have time for discussion so I'll let them introduce themselves when we go into the discussion.,245,,
1296,0.97,8755.947,8758.483,I will briefly walk through what we're going to cover today.,245,,
1297,0.97,8758.483,8771.729,And then turn it over to Tom Mikesell for details and then for the consideration of some potential strategy.,245,,
1298,0.97,8771.729,8772.029,Great.,246,,
1299,0.97,8772.029,8773.464,And thank you very much.,246,,
1300,0.97,8773.464,8775.7,Just as a hinder.,246,,
1301,0.97,8775.7,8777.368,I mentioned this at the meeting.,246,,
1302,0.97,8777.368,8793.217,"For this item, you can find both the power point presentation and the central staff memo, by going to the Finance and housing comes agenda link.",246,,
1303,0.97,8793.217,8802.193,"Click on meeting details, and you can find links under item number 5's supporting documents when you click on that agenda items.",246,,
1304,0.97,8802.193,8814.438,"If any members of the community are interested in that, we will try to send you the direct link but you can also go to meeting details.",246,,
1305,0.97,8814.572,8829.887,Click item 5. Stoz we will present an updated financial plan for general fund transmittal of the Mayor's proposed 23 budget that will be subject to the Council.,246,,
1306,0.97,8829.887,8835.96,This update reflects the general fund which was presented by the city budget office.,246,,
1307,0.97,8835.96,8857.248,"And updated expenditure information that includes what is estimated to be general fund expenditures, based on the future estimated cost of continuing the ongoing programs that were funded in the 2022 adopted budget, as well as changes to the planning Reserve assumptions, provided by the city budget office.",246,,
1308,0.97,8857.248,8860.384,And any supplemental adjustments made since the May 4TH discussion.,246,,
1309,0.97,8860.384,8867.425,As the chair described and you heard in the previous agenda items and we'll see in the Subscent slides.,246,,
1310,0.97,8867.425,8872.396,Both the Mayor and Council are preparing for uncertainties about the future.,246,,
1311,0.97,8872.396,8876.701,"As noted, the plan presented today, serves as the starting point for the Mayor.",246,,
1312,0.97,8876.701,8884.909,And we look forward to working with central staff to determine if it is consistent with the legislation.,246,,
1313,0.97,8884.909,8890.781,"And if not, work with you all to develop a final city budget for 2023 that reflects your priorities.",246,,
1314,0.97,8890.781,8903.461,"With that, I'll turn it over to Tom to walk through this in more",246,,
1315,0.97,8903.461,8907.465,"Thank you, I'm Tom Mikesell with your central staff.",247,,
1316,0.97,8907.465,8918.142,"And good morning to you, Finance and housing comment members as well.",247,,
1317,0.97,8918.142,8927.451,Aly already gave this broad scene.,247,,
1318,0.97,8927.451,8929.487,So I'll dive into the update project.,247,,
1319,0.97,8929.487,8940.631,The plan we'll share today includes expend Dur growth in 2022 and 2023.,247,,
1320,0.97,8940.631,8942.633,On continuing 2022 adopted budget service.,247,,
1321,0.97,8942.633,8951.742,The presentation shows this information differently than how Cvo casts it in their final plans that they include in the budget.,247,,
1322,0.97,8951.742,8962.219,"However, the underlying data and assumptions are the same as what CBO was using T. does include baseline growth and extend Turs to continue in 2022 services.",247,,
1323,0.97,8962.219,8972.93,But it's really the starting point for policy proposals that may be considered in the Mayor's proposed balanced budget coming in September.,247,,
1324,0.97,8972.93,8973.331,Next slide please.,247,,
1325,0.97,8973.331,8983.774,"So I guess to reiterate, these numbers do not include any policies or programs that were adopted ATs as one time in 2022.",247,,
1326,0.97,8983.774,8987.845,So they were only expected to begin and end in the current year.,247,,
1327,0.97,8988.045,8994.485,They aren't included in any Policy-Related additions.,247,,
1328,0.97,8994.485,8999.39,But they also do not represent a foregone conclusion.,247,,
1329,0.97,8999.39,9002.56,"Council has jurisdiction over all elements, including the city baseline.",247,,
1330,0.97,9002.56,9017.808,"So while we're past these as sort of a projection of a base, it's just an important to note as a caveat that all elements, including those elements that we're discussing today are part of the balancing picture and part of the budget that will be presented in the fall.",247,,
1331,0.97,9018.009,9034.392,"But with that being said, this is the final update of kind of the ongoing 2022 service cost projection that we am be able to--we will present prior to receiving the Mayor's proposed budget in September.",247,,
1332,0.97,9034.525,9035.459,So next slide please.,247,,
1333,0.97,9035.593,9043.334,So these next couple of slides are like graphical representation that was discussed in May.,247,,
1334,0.97,9043.334,9046.971,When we first looked at the general fund financial plan.,247,,
1335,0.97,9047.104,9048.739,So now we're including graphs.,247,,
1336,0.97,9048.739,9050.775,Kind of catching up with the 20th century.,247,,
1337,0.97,9050.908,9062.887,"So this shows in these basic lines showing in red, the expenditure projection and in green, the revenue projection that we looked at in May.",247,,
1338,0.97,9063.087,9068.659,The key piece of detail here is the operating gap.,247,,
1339,0.97,9068.659,9076.2,So that's the difference between the expenditure projection and the revenues that are projected to be available to support them next year and in future years in the plan.,247,,
1340,0.97,9076.4,9094.919,"So back in May, one of the headline numbers of this operating gap was $117 million difference in of between revenues and expenditures in 2023.",247,,
1341,0.97,9094.919,9096.053,Soalso based on that information.,247,,
1342,0.97,9096.053,9097.688,The gap was projected to narrow in the future.,247,,
1343,0.97,9097.688,9102.827,As you can see by these kind of converging lines by 2026.,247,,
1344,0.97,9102.827,9105.629,Where the $117 million shrinks to a lower number.,247,,
1345,0.97,9105.629,9111.168,"Unfortunately, updates that we'll talk about in upcoming slides, we'll show that that gap WIDENS.",247,,
1346,0.97,9111.168,9115.973,But that's what we're looking at with those main numbers.,247,,
1347,0.97,9115.973,9117.475,Next slide.,247,,
1348,0.97,9117.475,9124.748,So the general fund ending unreserved fund balance is kind of the next critical metric in considering adopted budget.,247,,
1349,0.97,9124.748,9130.988,"Essentially, this Saturday number that determines whether a budget is balanced or not.",247,,
1350,0.97,9130.988,9138.162,So the ending unreserved balance for legally adopted balance has to be zero or higher.,247,,
1351,0.97,9138.162,9146.971,"So back in May, the production for 2023 was $30 million negative ending Reserve balance.",247,,
1352,0.97,9146.971,9151.709,And that number grew to $249 million negative by 2026.,247,,
1353,0.97,9151.709,9161.152,"And this is entirely loses of the, what was happening with projected revenues and expenditures, as shown in the prior slides.",247,,
1354,0.97,9161.152,9172.73,"So in other words, the unreserved fund balance got worse in future years, because there was an ongoing gap between futures and revenue expenditures.",247,,
1355,0.97,9172.73,9173.664,That's the Recap of May.,247,,
1356,0.97,9173.664,9185.075,"Next couple of slides, I'm going to include some of the new data that we have referred, from various partners, to update these projections with more recent data.",247,,
1357,0.97,9185.075,9196.754,So this slide is really just RECAPTURING all of the work in detail that was just presented to you in the prior agenda item from the forecast office and the city budget office.,247,,
1358,0.97,9196.754,9204.295,"And it just play layers in and shows graphically the changes to, from the many forecasts in the lighter blue line.",247,,
1359,0.97,9204.295,9211.201,And the now August forecast in the darker blue line.,247,,
1360,0.97,9211.335,9213.837,"The--actually, if we could go back to that one slide.",247,,
1361,0.97,9214.038,9226.55,"I just want to highlight a few points that are not really embedded, but they could kind of continue on the discussion from the forecast office in the prior agenda item.",247,,
1362,0.97,9226.55,9233.424,And that is with regards to the baseline and the pessimistic scenario.,247,,
1363,0.97,9233.424,9241.098,"Again, it's an important point that the probability of the pessimistic scenario is higher.",247,,
1364,0.97,9241.098,9242.933,Albeit similar to the baseline.,247,,
1365,0.97,9243.067,9247.504,There is suggestion I would offer to the community to keep in mind when considering that.,247,,
1366,0.97,9247.504,9266.49,"One is due to recent action by the Council, particularly in the budget legislation, the city's revenue stabilization Fund, which sole purpose is to be in place in the economic news that results in a revenue reduction, is now fully funded.",247,,
1367,0.97,9266.49,9273.931,So that is an approximately $62 million of available resource that helped mitigate some of the risk of an economic shock.,247,,
1368,0.97,9273.931,9275.432,So that's good news.,247,,
1369,0.97,9275.566,9276.4,Also?,247,,
1370,0.97,9276.4,9287.011,"News to consider or information, is that on average, in the past, city revenue forecasts have generally come in, have been lower than Actuals.",247,,
1371,0.97,9287.011,9289.88,"So of course, a recession is a surprise.",247,,
1372,0.97,9289.88,9293.684,And that would challenge the baseline assumption.,247,,
1373,0.97,9293.684,9301.625,"But on average, the forecasts have resulted in actual revenues that have come in higher than forecast.",247,,
1374,0.97,9301.625,9306.363,So it's just--it's vanish important to note and to keep in mind the risk.,247,,
1375,0.97,9306.363,9310.668,But there are also some physical tools in the Toolkit to help mitigate that.,247,,
1376,0.97,9310.668,9333.09,"And Tom, I just want to also note, the appreciation for central staff and to highlight that it was this Council, it was the previous budget committee in 2020 and 2021 that really pushed back on trying to draw down those reserves, even further than the comfort level that Seattle city council had.",248,,
1377,0.97,9333.09,9339.363,"The previous administration at one point, had suggested drawing down the reserves to nearly $3 million.",248,,
1378,0.97,9339.363,9350.574,"We really held the line on trying to preserve as much as possible in a really aggressive time line to build back funding into the reserves and into replenish that, largely with Jump-Start investments.",248,,
1379,0.97,9350.574,9352.976,But we held true to those commitments.,248,,
1380,0.97,9352.976,9355.746,"And as you noted, have succeeded in Replenishing.",248,,
1381,0.97,9355.746,9360.784,"And I really think that that's an important thing to highlight, I'm glad you did.",248,,
1382,0.97,9360.784,9364.621,And it shows strong fiscal stewardship over our budget.,248,,
1383,0.97,9364.621,9380.17,"I want to this opportunity as well, to thank our current administration and also the leadership of the city budget's office, Julie Dingley, for your partnership, ongoing, as we continue to try to address these going Collaboratively.",248,,
1384,0.97,9380.17,9384.108,"And glad we have these tools in our Toolkit, as you noted.",248,,
1385,0.97,9384.108,9390.714,"Aly, if we could move to the next slide.",249,,
1386,0.97,9390.714,9394.318,So these are the high-level expenditures.,249,,
1387,0.97,9394.318,9401.959,"Again, comparing this, the May 4TH plan with the new information in the baseline update, provided by CBO.",249,,
1388,0.97,9401.959,9406.697,Shows there is fairly significant growth and explaining expenditure projections.,249,,
1389,0.97,9406.697,9424.381,"So back in May, we actually were applying inflation adjustments to various categories, and in large part, those inflation categories were fairly successful in accommodating some of the costs am but the next explanation is why are these costs higher?",249,,
1390,0.97,9424.381,9427.584,And the reason is generally two things.,249,,
1391,0.97,9427.584,9431.455,"One, as noted in the review of the baseline data.",249,,
1392,0.97,9431.455,9436.827,There was--and included additional costs for human services contracts.,249,,
1393,0.97,9436.827,9448.205,"So in 2019, council adopted an ordinance admitted that human services contract would be inflated by CPI in future years.",249,,
1394,0.97,9448.205,9460.918,"So notably in May, in the May update, it did not appear that human services contracts had been inflated, according to the requirement, so that Seattle is code requirement.",249,,
1395,0.97,9460.918,9471.328,"Including notes in the baseline and also in future years, add to somewhat sizable increase in the cost of the projections that were provided in May.",249,,
1396,0.97,9471.328,9476.233,"Another piece of the kind of unanticipated growth since May, Isincreases in planning Reserve.",249,,
1397,0.97,9476.366,9483.874,"So these are kind of Below-The- line, reserves.",249,,
1398,0.97,9483.874,9491.348,"That may include as costs, because they are amounts held for future cost items.",249,,
1399,0.97,9491.348,9493.183,But they're held below the line.,249,,
1400,0.97,9493.183,9502.626,Because they're sometimes not fully formed over or include some legal or contractual nature that is not ripe to bed included in the budget.,249,,
1401,0.97,9502.626,9504.161,In the adopted budget.,249,,
1402,0.97,9504.161,9510.601,"So those two elements really are what are, as they enter this intersection and expenditures in future years.",249,,
1403,0.97,9510.734,9514.471,"In 2022, the cost growth is higher.",249,,
1404,0.97,9514.605,9518.442,But that's because of adopted legislation.,249,,
1405,0.97,9518.442,9525.749,"And then frankly, if you look at the sizable differences between the 2022 bar and the 2023 bar.",249,,
1406,0.97,9525.749,9531.054,"A lot that was is one-time stuff, dealing with Carry- forward.",249,,
1407,0.97,9531.054,9535.726,"So in dealing with prior presentations, we talk about the automatic Carry-Forwards.",249,,
1408,0.97,9535.726,9540.23,"Things of that nature that are essentially 2021 spending, that rolls into the next year.",249,,
1409,0.97,9540.23,9543.634,So that's why that bar is higher.,249,,
1410,0.97,9543.634,9549.339,"In general, the plan, in the baseline level, includes growth in all years from 2022 and forward.",249,,
1411,0.97,9549.339,9559.85,"So I just want to point that out, particularly for the viewing public who may not be exactly tuned in to all of the elements of the budget changes that we've discussed in this year.",249,,
1412,0.97,9560.05,9564.221,So if we could move to this slide.,249,,
1413,0.97,9564.221,9571.128,So this is kind of the more Tabular format of the financial plan.,249,,
1414,0.97,9571.128,9580.737,And shows the starting balance at the top of each year and runs through revenue exchanges and expenditures Toet get to the deficit.,249,,
1415,0.97,9580.737,9589.546,"So this blue row here is essentially the operating gap that we showed in the line chart, in the prior slide.",249,,
1416,0.97,9589.746,9597.988,Then you get to an ending Budgetery balance.,249,,
1417,0.97,9597.988,9604.761,There are some below the line to accommodate those kind of planning elements that are not yet included in the appropriation.,249,,
1418,0.97,9604.761,9608.732,Then you get to the bottom line ad numbers are off balance.,249,,
1419,0.97,9608.732,9611.435,A lot of detail on this chart.,249,,
1420,0.97,9611.435,9617.908,But the key Takeaway is the operating surplus is higher than what was originally projected in May.,249,,
1421,0.97,9617.908,9631.555,"And the ending unreserved fund balance, which is the metric to determine the balance budget is actually somewhat better in 2023, largely because there are balances carried over from the current year in the projection.",249,,
1422,0.97,9631.688,9639.596,"But on balance, it generally leads to a growing negative unreserved fund balance by 2026.",249,,
1423,0.97,9639.796,9646.069,So this is the sort of the table form to look at this data.,249,,
1424,0.97,9646.069,9650.273,"And then again, we can go through in the next couple of slides, the graphs.",249,,
1425,0.97,9650.273,9659.616,"So this is updating those graph presentations of the May data, using now, the new information, to show you the projected operating gap for August.",249,,
1426,0.97,9659.616,9665.288,"So as you can see, compared to the May graph, the average operating gap has grown.",249,,
1427,0.97,9665.288,9670.26,"So it's about on average, $142 million on average each year.",249,,
1428,0.97,9670.26,9678.902,"And notably, the--how, in the May plan, those two lines were getting closer by 2026.",249,,
1429,0.97,9678.902,9690.947,"Now, largely due to kind of lower revenue projections in the future, combined with the increased cost for human services contract, inflation that is required per code.",249,,
1430,0.97,9690.947,9704.961,"And planning Reserve assumptions, the lines are fairly consistent, about $142 million between the two.",249,,
1431,0.97,9704.961,9714.805,"So that's basically saying this has deteriorated somewhat in May presentation, given the recent revenue and expenditure update.",249,,
1432,0.97,9714.805,9721.745,"And then the impact on the end reserve fund balance, would be shown on the next slide.",249,,
1433,0.97,9721.745,9730.253,"Which shows essentially the comparison in this bottom line balanced budget indicator, comparing the May plan, which is in red.",249,,
1434,0.97,9730.253,9733.457,"And the August financial plan, the updated numbers, which is in blue.",249,,
1435,0.97,9733.457,9742.733,"And you can see, actually, in the current year, it's projected to be slightly better.",249,,
1436,0.97,9742.733,9757.814,"And that's because the revenue forecast for the current year is higher, primarily due to the 2021 expense liabilities that were received in 2022 and credit to the general fund.",249,,
1437,0.97,9757.814,9769.893,"So for 2023, the projected numbers of ending fund policy proves from negative to negative 17 million.",249,,
1438,0.97,9769.893,9776.733,But relies on starting balances in 2023.,249,,
1439,0.97,9776.733,9792.749,"Over the long term, given the longer and growing gap, the fund balance by 2026, goes from negative 249, to negative $444 million on dollars.",249,,
1440,0.97,9792.749,9795.685,And I just want to make an important NOTE on this.,249,,
1441,0.97,9795.685,9802.893,Because that's a very large number.,249,,
1442,0.97,9802.893,9805.962,And it can be somewhat frightening when looking at a number like that.,249,,
1443,0.97,9805.962,9809.933,This is just a planning document.,249,,
1444,0.97,9809.933,9812.202,And it will be updated again in the fall.,249,,
1445,0.97,9812.202,9815.672,And will be updated numerous times before we get to 2026.,249,,
1446,0.97,9815.672,9825.015,"And Furthermore, there is no legal requirement that the out year of the financial plan be balanced.",249,,
1447,0.97,9825.015,9833.456,"What is to be required, the only thing required to be balanced is the legally adopted budget that is considered by the Council.",249,,
1448,0.97,9833.456,9837.327,"So this financial plan, particularly in the out years is a planning guide.",249,,
1449,0.97,9837.327,9847.37,And it's not intended to indicate that the Council needs to balance that $444 million ending Reserve balance.,249,,
1450,0.97,9847.37,9849.806,Projected for 2026 in this year.,249,,
1451,0.97,9849.806,9861.885,So just wanted to add that context because of the size of the number and the challenge its represents.,249,,
1452,0.97,9861.885,9867.357,Because it is several years in the future.,249,,
1453,0.97,9867.357,9873.797,It's a useful metric but not the sole governing metric in this analysis.,249,,
1454,0.97,9873.797,9876.066,If we could go to the next slide.,249,,
1455,0.97,9876.066,9877.901,And just to refresh.,249,,
1456,0.97,9877.901,9881.705,I intentionally tried to go to a fairly fast clip.,249,,
1457,0.97,9881.705,9888.912,"There is a backup memo, as chair Mosqueda mentioned, that includes details on this.",249,,
1458,0.97,9888.912,9892.549,But I wanted to refresh on the key Takeaways.,249,,
1459,0.97,9892.549,9897.12,"And that it's basically, now, I lost my chart.",249,,
1460,0.97,9897.12,9899.589,The slide.,249,,
1461,0.97,9899.723,9909.833,Yeah.,250,,
1462,0.97,9913.036,9917.34,So the general deficit and fund has worsened.,250,,
1463,0.97,9917.34,9918.441,Unreserved balance has slightly improved for 2023.,250,,
1464,0.97,9918.441,9923.346,"But over the long term, it's projected to get worse.",250,,
1465,0.97,9923.346,9935.492,"The magnitude of the challenge increased however, there will be some changes, including new revenues to certain fund policies over both long-term and temporary basis.",250,,
1466,0.97,9935.492,9938.328,That we discussed in May.,250,,
1467,0.97,9938.328,9940.897,Those factors still apply in this--in looking at this plan.,250,,
1468,0.97,9941.031,9957.247,"Next is that the executive is still looking at decisions around balancing their proposed balanced budget, which will result in plans and changes to this financial plan, and there will be transmitted to the proposed budget.",250,,
1469,0.97,9957.247,9963.753,Transmitted with the proposed budget and staff will do this recurring analysis based on this data.,250,,
1470,0.97,9963.753,9965.255,And on a high level.,250,,
1471,0.97,9965.255,9971.461,Both the Mayor and Council are faced with this challenge.,250,,
1472,0.97,9971.594,9975.365,And Initiationing cost 70s.,250,,
1473,0.97,9975.365,9978.368,And higher risk of further decline in city revenues.,250,,
1474,0.97,9978.368,9991.381,So this is just the starting point that puts us in a good position for considering those different options that will be considered in the coming months.,250,,
1475,0.97,9991.381,9992.949,And that concludes my comments.,250,,
1476,0.97,9992.949,9998.421,I believe I am turning over to director Dingley for additional slides.,250,,
1477,0.97,9998.421,9998.855,"Thank you, Tom.",251,,
1478,0.97,9998.855,9999.489,Welcome back.,252,,
1479,0.97,9999.489,10000.824,Thank you so much.,253,,
1480,0.97,10000.824,10001.758,"Thank you, chair.",253,,
1481,0.97,10001.758,10003.126,"Thank you, Tom.",253,,
1482,0.97,10003.259,10005.528,"First, I want to start by saying thank you.",253,,
1483,0.97,10005.528,10007.03,Thank you for having me here today.,253,,
1484,0.97,10007.03,10015.238,But also a deep appreciation and gratitude for the partnership with central staff and with the chair.,253,,
1485,0.97,10015.238,10017.774,I have been very encouraged by this relationship.,253,,
1486,0.97,10017.774,10033.289,And I think it's really great that we have been able to translate really technical information into term fist are folks and deepen people's understanding of why we are in this position and where do we go from here.,253,,
1487,0.97,10033.289,10040.096,Transitioning to what I came here to sort of emphasize a lot of what has been said today.,253,,
1488,0.97,10040.096,10049.372,"But from a technical perspective, CBO has what we need to deliver the Mayor's 2023 and 2024 proposed budget.",253,,
1489,0.97,10049.372,10053.71,"However, we are obviously closely monitoring the forecast in available revenues.",253,,
1490,0.97,10053.71,10064.821,"So as a reminder that, of course, in conjunction with the aforementioned partners, we are looking at this.",253,,
1491,0.97,10064.821,10069.225,Asking each city Department to identify areas for reductions.,253,,
1492,0.97,10069.225,10076.833,"Looking at areas, where there are increased cost pressures to deliver core services and meet the needs of the community.",253,,
1493,0.97,10076.833,10080.336,Exploring progressive revenue options throughout task force.,253,,
1494,0.97,10080.336,10081.337,In partnership with chair Mosqueda.,253,,
1495,0.97,10081.337,10087.51,"Of course, those are Longer- term solutions that are not available to help us in this near term.",253,,
1496,0.97,10087.51,10093.716,"And being, not listed here because of an author error, which is my own.",253,,
1497,0.97,10093.716,10095.018,Expand adjacent revenue streams.,253,,
1498,0.97,10095.018,10099.489,Ask those are areas like Short- term beverage tax.,253,,
1499,0.97,10099.489,10103.526,Things we have discussed previously.,253,,
1500,0.97,10103.526,10113.036,"I've also been able to meet with most of you in the last two weeks, Councilmembers, to talk about the structural challenges that we collectively face.",253,,
1501,0.97,10113.036,10115.405,And address Councilmember priorities for this budget and beyond.,253,,
1502,0.97,10115.405,10125.048,And I'm happy to report that the good news is I have heard broad agreement Andalignment between Councilmembers and the Mayor as a whole.,253,,
1503,0.97,10125.048,10129.385,And I don't think I'm telling tales out of tune to share.,253,,
1504,0.97,10129.385,10146.302,"And those include continuing to provide existing services while avoiding layoff focusing on most vulnerable, especially focusing on the pandemic and resulting conditions and addressing homelessness and public safety.",253,,
1505,0.97,10146.302,10147.937,So now that we have those inputs.,253,,
1506,0.97,10147.937,10150.006,Now we're looking at the challenges to meet.,253,,
1507,0.97,10150.006,10153.143,So if we can go back just one slide please.,253,,
1508,0.97,10153.143,10153.409,Thank you.,253,,
1509,0.97,10153.61,10160.617,So now we need to still determine what the number is that we'll collectively budget to for 2023.,253,,
1510,0.97,10160.617,10165.054,And as you heard from central staff.,253,,
1511,0.97,10165.054,10167.657,And director noble.,253,,
1512,0.97,10167.657,10168.591,There is still inconsistency.,253,,
1513,0.97,10168.591,10176.766,"I'm going to run through these challenges that we're looking with, as we come to look at our proposed budget for 2023 and 2024.",253,,
1514,0.97,10176.766,10184.841,"So as we heard, Pandemic- related behaviors are continuing to negatively affect revenues.",253,,
1515,0.97,10184.841,10190.313,And might lead to slowing revenue growth in an ongoing way.,253,,
1516,0.97,10190.313,10197.787,"Forecasters, I do not envy the work of director noble and Henis.",253,,
1517,0.97,10197.787,10203.426,They are consequently uncertain between that baseline pessimistic forecast.,253,,
1518,0.97,10203.426,10206.563,Of what will happen.,253,,
1519,0.97,10206.563,10211.935,So we're going to be in a situation where we are living forecast to forecast.,253,,
1520,0.97,10211.935,10220.543,"Which suggests to the point during director noble's presentation, that perhaps directing might be what we need.",253,,
1521,0.97,10220.543,10233.656,We'll be looking for areas to be conservative throughout the budget to hedge against that potential downside risk.,253,,
1522,0.97,10233.656,10240.897,"Further, year over year, and the forecast is suggesting that it will take 12 to 18 months to fall back into the 2 to 3% range.",253,,
1523,0.97,10240.897,10247.604,You can go to the next slide please.,253,,
1524,0.97,10247.604,10250.139,"So again, this is a little bit, it bears repeating.",253,,
1525,0.97,10250.139,10252.442,So bear with me here.,253,,
1526,0.97,10252.442,10257.28,That rising prices boost percentage prices based on sales taxes.,253,,
1527,0.97,10257.28,10265.221,"But there are some that do not move automatically with price changes, like property taxes.",253,,
1528,0.97,10265.221,10270.159,Puts continuous pressure on buying power and budgets for commodities.,253,,
1529,0.97,10270.159,10278.901,"Ultimately, high inflation conditions will result in structural deficits in the general Fund and other funds, even as we contend with existing balancing challenges.",253,,
1530,0.97,10278.901,10280.27,So our fine power is going to go down.,253,,
1531,0.97,10280.27,10286.175,"And of course, new revenue options are not readily available.",253,,
1532,0.97,10286.175,10287.443,Those are longer-term strategies.,253,,
1533,0.97,10287.443,10291.614,"So this updated financial plan that you saw from Tom, is the starting point.",253,,
1534,0.97,10291.614,10296.786,"But it also doesn't just, you know, grow outside of expenses in the baseline.",253,,
1535,0.97,10296.786,10303.326,"And it also assumes no continuation of one-time items from 2022, of which there were many.",253,,
1536,0.97,10303.326,10310.566,"And of course, an ongoing challenge is that we have open labor contracts for a significant number of our city unions.",253,,
1537,0.97,10310.566,10312.135,And those negotiations are ongoing.,253,,
1538,0.97,10312.135,10321.344,"So ultimately, at the end of the day, this forecast is not significantly mitigated, has not significantly mitigated the challenge we have all discussed and acknowledged.",253,,
1539,0.97,10321.344,10329.519,But I do hope to engage with all of you more in the coming weeks as we craft the Mayor's 2023 and 2024 budget.,253,,
1540,0.97,10329.519,10334.59,So we can collectively meet our goals in an environment with challenging circumstances.,253,,
1541,0.97,10334.59,10341.497,So I will turn it back to deputy director Pennucci and Tom to tell us what is next.,253,,
1542,0.97,10341.497,10343.466,Thank you very much.,253,,
1543,0.97,10343.466,10347.503,"Thank you, director Dingley.",254,,
1544,0.97,10347.637,10352.208,So just kind of to finish this up.,254,,
1545,0.97,10352.208,10365.354,"The Mayor will submit his proposed '23-'24 budget on September 24th, which will include policy proposals on top of the baseline numbers that we reviewed today.",254,,
1546,0.97,10365.354,10372.762,"And the Council, of course, will then consider that proposal and make changes to adopt a balanced budget for 2023.",254,,
1547,0.97,10372.762,10377.767,"And endorse balanced budget for 2024, with update targeted for November 22nd.",254,,
1548,0.97,10377.767,10382.505,"As I mentioned, this is the final review of this information, prior to receiving the budget.",254,,
1549,0.97,10382.505,10396.252,"There will also be, during the Council's budget, Deliberative process, there will be a final revenue forecast from both CBO and the office of economic forecast that we will receive in November.",254,,
1550,0.97,10396.252,10402.058,Which will continue to keep the pulse on what is happening when the economy.,254,,
1551,0.97,10402.058,10417.607,"And then Finally, this has been just assurance that using the framework we started in May and continuing today, central staff will continue to provide the budget proposals being considered have an impact on the financial planning projections.",254,,
1552,0.97,10417.607,10419.475,At any stage in the process.,254,,
1553,0.97,10419.609,10422.712,So that concludes our presentation.,254,,
1554,0.97,10422.845,10427.15,And available to help with any questions we have.,254,,
1555,0.97,10427.15,10427.817,Okay.,255,,
1556,0.97,10427.817,10436.959,"Colleagues, I do want to tee up a few items as well, that I think are a follow-up to this presentation, before getting into more of a discussion or questions.",255,,
1557,0.97,10436.959,10440.563,I think hopefully this will help round out our discussion about where do we go from here.,255,,
1558,0.97,10440.763,10453.142,"As the budget chair, Famoused with a significant budget deficit, as you've heard, we have been in deep conversation with central staff and really appreciate the collaboration with the city budget's office.",255,,
1559,0.97,10453.142,10476.432,"But after we referred the news on Monday last week, from the office of economic and revenue forecast, I have asked central staff to work to calculate a scenario, in which we are able to fully preserve the commitments of the 2020 jump start spend plan, as codified in statutes with the amounts in 2020, based on the revenue that we understood to be available.",255,,
1560,0.97,10476.432,10483.239,We want to maintain the amounts and the spending categories as directed in the Jump-Start spend plan.,255,,
1561,0.97,10483.239,10496.786,"For example, that would still allow for us to see a near 42% increase in investments in the spend plan, as codified by this Council, as it related to Jump- start spending.",255,,
1562,0.97,10496.786,10505.261,"That's a 42% increase for things like affordable housing, New deal, equitable investment, equitable recovery.",255,,
1563,0.97,10505.261,10508.264,These are our commitments that woo made to a broad coalition.,255,,
1564,0.97,10508.264,10515.905,"And it's the commitments that we as Councilmembers universally, unanimously, approved and codified into statute.",255,,
1565,0.97,10515.905,10540.763,"The ability to move forward with those commitments, something that I really want to be able to stand by, as we also recognize, there are some potential short-term solutions for 2022--2023 and 2024 that could use the balance of the Jump-Start revenues that are projected to come in above the levels estimated from 2022.",255,,
1566,0.97,10540.763,10546.369,And use that difference to help us address the general fund current deficit.,255,,
1567,0.97,10546.369,10547.069,In the short-term.,255,,
1568,0.97,10547.069,10551.908,"Just for those two years, to prevent significant reductions in city services.",255,,
1569,0.97,10551.908,10557.68,And I would also say that when we as a council passed Jump- start in 2020.,255,,
1570,0.97,10557.68,10564.02,We had intended for Jump-Start to also help prevent against austerity at the beginning of the Pandemib.,255,,
1571,0.97,10564.02,10568.291,So pandemic.,255,,
1572,0.97,10568.291,10586.676,"So it very much in line with making sure we protect the critical city services, lead moving forward with the commitment we the statue we codified in 2020 that would allow us to in 2022 and beyond make sure we have direct Justicements in the categories in conjunction with Ourspend plan.",255,,
1573,0.97,10586.676,10617.039,"As everyone knows as we have talked about this budget situation in the last eight months, thanks in large part to the transparency that has been made available, because central staff took the directive from two years ago, to dig into the footnote that was included in the last two years' projections, and really daylight the six-year financial plan, we began having a conversation in a collaborative way, with our new director of the city budget's office, Julie Dingley, with central staff at the table.",255,,
1574,0.97,10617.039,10627.75,"Starting this year, to say, how do we collectively, as a city family, address this shortfall, that was buried in, I think, page 700-Something.",255,,
1575,0.97,10627.75,10643.132,"And page 600-Something in our last two budgets and bring that to our forefront, so that we could collectively address the Underspin that had been used to fill in future years' budget.",255,,
1576,0.97,10643.132,10653.009,"As I've said repeatedly, jump start progressive revenue, could not be the only solution to addressing the shortfall, that was identified in the Six- year, fiscal year outlook.",255,,
1577,0.97,10653.009,10669.258,"I have asked staff to go forth with helping us as a Council, and Incollaboration with the city budget's office, look at this scenario, that would allow for the modest estimates from the 2022 Underspend to be built into the baseline expenditures.",255,,
1578,0.97,10669.392,10677.133,"Assume very little growth in New expenditures in 2023, that will help hold our budget steady.",255,,
1579,0.97,10677.133,10704.226,"But to address this shortfall that we will face in 2023 and 2024, as I noted, stay true, to the 2020 spend plan as codified in jump starts, expenditure plan, stay true to those amounts and use that difference, the Higher-Than- anticipated dollar amounts to happen us with the general fund Underspend.",255,,
1580,0.97,10704.226,10711.7,"His has been what the committee has is asked us to look like in the past, General fund stream.",255,,
1581,0.97,10711.7,10718.407,But even those additional revenue streams are not significant enough in the near term to help us close this Gan.,255,,
1582,0.97,10718.407,10738.928,"So this short-term solution that I'm suggesting and I will ask central staff to walk us through this scenario, this short-term solution with clear sideboards to only be used for two years and maintain our plans, with the amounts we need in 2020.",255,,
1583,0.97,10738.928,10744.734,This would need to be coupled with the longer-term strategies.,255,,
1584,0.97,10744.734,10751.74,"Investing in Progressive revenue sources that would be available to us, starting for the 2025-2026 budget cycles.",255,,
1585,0.97,10751.74,10757.246,So that would mean revenue would need to be implemented and we would need to start collecting in 2024.,255,,
1586,0.97,10757.246,10775.598,"And I'm very excited that in partnership with the Mayor's office, we are continuing to move forward with establishing a progressive revenue work group that will be able to identify solutions for us throughout next year, that I hope will be able to be implemented in 2024, that would allow for the longer-term stability.",255,,
1587,0.97,10775.598,10780.569,"The Seattle work group for a change, could then be used in 2025 and beyond.",255,,
1588,0.97,10780.569,10787.309,"So that this short-term approach to Jump-Starts higher for anticipated revenue, would be very short-term in nature.",255,,
1589,0.97,10787.309,10794.45,"Second thing is, we want to continue to seek state and Federal funds, county partnership in every place possible.",255,,
1590,0.97,10794.45,10801.123,And we are continually inspired by the progressive revenue options and policies that are coming from Congress right now.,255,,
1591,0.97,10801.123,10802.324,This follows up on American rescue plan.,255,,
1592,0.97,10802.525,10807.296,The Coronavirus local relief funds.,255,,
1593,0.97,10807.296,10809.598,The bipartisan infrastructure bill.,255,,
1594,0.97,10809.598,10811.033,And now the inflation adjustment act.,255,,
1595,0.97,10811.033,10815.805,We are going to continue to see possible revenue streams coming to our State and region.,255,,
1596,0.97,10815.805,10824.547,And we want to work in partnership with the state counties to bring additional revenue to offset where the city may have stepped up.,255,,
1597,0.97,10824.547,10827.516,Where dollars are not available from those.,255,,
1598,0.97,10827.516,10850.005,"And third, as you heard director Dingley note, in this meeting and previous meeting, there are systemic issues that the city budget office is committed to addressing, to make sure that we are improving our budget baseline assumption, so that every year, we do not have dollars going to Department for positions that are vacant.",255,,
1599,0.97,10850.005,10856.645,We cannot rely on using Underspend from one calendar year to be paid for next calendar year's budget.,255,,
1600,0.97,10856.645,10868.757,That is not sustainable and director Dingley has taken that issue head-on and is working on policies in the city so that each Department has Realtime budgeting information going forward after this year.,255,,
1601,0.97,10868.757,10870.159,I appreciate that.,255,,
1602,0.97,10870.292,10879.635,"And colleagues, Lastly, I'd like to signal that the scenario that I'm asking the city, central staff to walk through is a policy pack that we're exploring again.",255,,
1603,0.97,10879.635,10884.74,Exploring for the 2023 and 2024 budget shortfall only.,255,,
1604,0.97,10884.74,10887.543,"It is short-term, one-time solution in nature.",255,,
1605,0.97,10887.543,10894.35,Allowing for us to maintain our spending as originally intended in the 2020 spend plan as codified.,255,,
1606,0.97,10894.35,10899.121,And allows for us to maintain the full amounts assumed into those categories.,255,,
1607,0.97,10899.121,10903.125,Still allows for an increase of 42% for example.,255,,
1608,0.97,10903.125,10903.492,In housing.,255,,
1609,0.97,10903.492,10909.565,And it does not rely only on Jump-Start to solve the systemic issue.,255,,
1610,0.97,10909.565,10914.136,It allows for us to build in Progressive revenue in the future.,255,,
1611,0.97,10914.136,10925.848,"And if we Over-Relied, frankly, on Jump-Start now, we would have an unsustainable budget if the revenue forecast continues to decrease in the November forecast we will receive this year or in future years.",255,,
1612,0.97,10925.848,10943.933,"So this is not only the smart thing to be able to do to start, to be able to ward off austerity, to be able to make the investments, and literally Jump-Start our economy and housing and equitable recovery.",255,,
1613,0.97,10943.933,10949.872,"But also allows for us to move forward with investments in our core, the city services.",255,,
1614,0.97,10949.872,10951.473,And vulnerable populations.,255,,
1615,0.97,10951.607,10955.311,That Jump-Start initially intended to protect as well.,255,,
1616,0.97,10955.311,10957.046,By preventing against austerity.,255,,
1617,0.97,10957.046,10965.321,"So as you know, I don't do anything out here on the Dias in development on policy, without talking to key Stakeholders.",255,,
1618,0.97,10965.321,10975.397,"And we had a large number of organizations that were part of building the tax proposal and Jump-Start, along with my Council colleagues, who cosponsored the legislation.",255,,
1619,0.97,10975.531,10991.647,"I have reached back out to some of those Stakeholders that were part of our initial, conceptual tax discussion, and talked about the opportunity to maintain the 2020 spend plan, as codified into statute.",255,,
1620,0.97,10991.647,10993.916,Short-term solution for the next two years.,255,,
1621,0.97,10993.916,10996.518,Rely on progressive revenue going forward.,255,,
1622,0.97,10996.518,11001.757,And clear sideboards on how jump starts integrity would be maintained.,255,,
1623,0.97,11001.757,11010.065,"And I really appreciate that I've received a positive message back from the Washington state budget and policy center, working Washington, 350 Seattle.",255,,
1624,0.97,11010.065,11025.247,"The Seattle King County coalition on homelessness, Sciu925, teamsters 117 and a number of individuals who are still having conversations in community, but very much strongly support the approach of maintaining jump start's integrity.",255,,
1625,0.97,11025.247,11036.258,"Nay wrote me a comment that said, we worked tirelessly in 2020, with Councilmember Mosqueda and other colleagues sponsoring Jump-Start.",255,,
1626,0.97,11036.258,11045.868,"To build this robust community support for aggressive revenue, to address the challenges of Covid, Bull also the chronic need for more progressive funding.",255,,
1627,0.97,11045.868,11053.008,"We developed the spend plan and consultation with communities, businesses and nonprofit organizations and service providers and residents of Seattle.",255,,
1628,0.97,11053.008,11059.982,"And they said, given that Jump- start is projected to raise above what was estimated in 2020.",255,,
1629,0.97,11059.982,11064.186,We support the requests made of central staff.,255,,
1630,0.97,11064.186,11079.902,"For central staff to look at a scenario that allows for us to temporarily address the Seattle budget shortfall in 2023 and 2024 only, with excess Jump- start revenue, going to core government services to create a more equitable Seattle.",255,,
1631,0.97,11079.902,11081.003,"They said, let's be clear.",255,,
1632,0.97,11081.003,11093.048,This means we want the full promise of funding and the commitments as outlined in the spending categories to be maintained and adhered to as envisioned in 2020.,255,,
1633,0.97,11093.048,11095.918,It's unacceptable that communities have waited for climate housing.,255,,
1634,0.97,11095.918,11110.399,And we recognized that jump starts higher than anticipated returns and its success is a way to temporarily support existing programs while maintaining the commitment that jump start originally envisioned for its spend plan as codified.,255,,
1635,0.97,11110.399,11115.471,So I really appreciate the support from some of the folks who are core to developing the spend plan.,255,,
1636,0.97,11115.471,11123.745,"And we will maintain the integrity of that spend plan, while looking at ways to provide initial relief to the budget.",255,,
1637,0.97,11123.745,11126.348,"Councilmember Herbold, I believe there's just three slides.",255,,
1638,0.97,11126.348,11132.387,"If central staff could walk through those briefly, and then we could take all questions together.",255,,
1639,0.97,11132.387,11132.588,Okay.,255,,
1640,0.97,11132.588,11138.861,"Central staff, please go ahead and walk us through those outlines that I just commented on.",255,,
1641,0.97,11138.861,11141.129,This is where I share my screen again.,256,,
1642,0.97,11141.129,11143.265,And try to leave it on the screen this time.,256,,
1643,0.97,11143.265,11147.97,"So thank you for that introduction, as chair Mosqueda described.",256,,
1644,0.97,11147.97,11163.685,We were asked to prepare a scenario that avoids austerity and preserves the commitments made in 2020 and affirmed in 2021 by the Council on how the Jump-Start tax revenues should be allocated.,256,,
1645,0.97,11163.685,11183.472,"So what we prepared for your consideration today, as guidance for the executive and director Dingley, as they prepared the proposed budget and consider the decisions ahead, is a proposal that would allow some amount of jump start fund to continue to provide continuity of city services in 2023 and 2024.",256,,
1646,0.97,11183.605,11195.15,And the amount would be calculated based on taking the revenue estimates we were using when developing the 2020 spending plan for jump start.,256,,
1647,0.97,11195.15,11198.754,And then comparing that to the current forecast.,256,,
1648,0.97,11198.754,11210.799,The difference between those numbers would be the maximum amount of Jump-Start revenue that could be transferred to the general fund to maintain city services.,256,,
1649,0.97,11210.799,11227.816,"It would be a short-term allowance, and it would be important in this proposal that the policies were Crafted in a way that would only allow that transfer, if general fund revenues continue to be projected to be less than expected, or excuse me, projected expenditures.",256,,
1650,0.97,11227.816,11246.134,"And then also require that as we get future revenue updates, if conditions improve in the general fund in the current year, forecasts improve, that the Jump-Start fund would be paid back first, prior to authorizing additional general fund expenditures.",256,,
1651,0.97,11246.134,11256.411,"So as shown at the time, the jump start spending plan and tax was authorized by the Council in 2020.",256,,
1652,0.97,11256.411,11260.215,We authorize in jump start revenue.,256,,
1653,0.97,11260.215,11263.151,And $227 million in 2024.,256,,
1654,0.97,11263.151,11268.39,"Revenues are currently about 30% higher, 30% or more higher than estimates.",256,,
1655,0.97,11268.39,11276.198,"This means the city could invest the full amount, the $223 million as originally committed in 2023.",256,,
1656,0.97,11276.198,11280.035,And 71 million would be transferred to the general fund in 2023.,256,,
1657,0.97,11280.035,11287.442,This next slide is an example of how that would play out for the jump start spending plan.,257,,
1658,0.97,11287.442,11301.323,"As shown on this table, in 2023, you could invest that full $223 million in Jump-Start fund categories and transfer $71 million to the general fund.",257,,
1659,0.97,11301.323,11313.435,"This would allow for significant increase in the Jump-Start spending categories for 2023, or about almost 40% or over 40%, as well as providing that support to the general fund.",257,,
1660,0.97,11313.435,11317.639,"In addition, you'll see that we are showing some fund balance in this table.",257,,
1661,0.97,11317.639,11324.279,"That is reflecting the amount of jump start revenue that is projected to come in, in 2022.",257,,
1662,0.97,11324.279,11331.953,But is higher than what we budgeted in the adopt--in the 2022 adopted budget.,257,,
1663,0.97,11331.953,11351.473,"And per director noble's presentation, given some of the uncertainty about payroll tax revenues and the Newness of that tax, central staff will be providing some options to create a reserve to ensure some stability in the jump start Fund, as well as providing that stability to the general fund.",257,,
1664,0.97,11351.673,11358.447,And this final slide shows the full scenario.,257,,
1665,0.97,11358.647,11364.286,So this is what it means for general fund balancing.,257,,
1666,0.97,11364.286,11372.06,"So along with the jump start, we included modest assumptions about 2022 Underspend of about $20 million.",257,,
1667,0.97,11372.06,11392.714,"And as this committee has been engaged in conversations, we know that currently, the executive is looking for, is currently holding certain expenditures in 2022, understanding the projected shortfall in 2023, and reserving some of those resources to mitigate any reductions that need to be made to basic expenditures.",257,,
1668,0.97,11392.714,11404.926,"It also does model a modest Sawmpledz, about certain baseline budget reductions, less than 1%, a half a percent in 2023, to help balance the budget.",257,,
1669,0.97,11404.926,11408.196,And to address the structural deficit in the Outyears.,257,,
1670,0.97,11408.196,11430.685,"Of course as the chair noted, we would need to rely on other notions, and we were currently engaged in ongoing conversations with other staff, on new progressive revenues, as well as really looking at our baseline budget expenditures, and how to Reprioritize city spending to meet the most critical needs.",257,,
1671,0.97,11430.685,11441.696,"So in this table, these three purple rows show the sort of difference between the financial plan that Tom described and how this scenario would affect it.",257,,
1672,0.97,11441.696,11445.867,So the first line shows that $20 million Underspend in 2022.,257,,
1673,0.97,11445.867,11452.14,"And then the assumption about a half a percent, baseline reduction in expenditures.",257,,
1674,0.97,11452.14,11462.15,It shows a maximum transfer from the Jump-Start fund to the general fund of $71 million in '23 and $84 million in '24.,257,,
1675,0.97,11462.15,11466.888,And it assumes some new spending will have to occur in 2023.,257,,
1676,0.97,11466.888,11476.631,"This can be spread out in 2023 and 2024, acknowledging there will be some cost increases that are unavoidable that are not yet reflected in the baseline budget.",257,,
1677,0.97,11476.631,11478.967,And again this is just a scenario.,257,,
1678,0.97,11478.967,11480.168,We don't have complete information.,257,,
1679,0.97,11480.168,11484.406,The budget office is still working on proposals from the departments and decisions from the Mayor.,257,,
1680,0.97,11484.406,11491.68,"But as shown in this scenario, this would mean that the Jump- start fund could maintain those 2020 commitments.",257,,
1681,0.97,11491.68,11496.551,"Contribute to the general fund picture, and show a balanced budget at the end of 2024.",257,,
1682,0.97,11496.551,11499.821,And would improve the conditions for 2026.,257,,
1683,0.97,11499.821,11502.29,And as Tom noted in his presentation.,257,,
1684,0.97,11502.29,11507.696,It is not required that the financial plan show a balanced budget in the out years.,257,,
1685,0.97,11507.696,11518.74,"It's just informed that we continue working together to identify longer-term strategies, so we don't continue to face this deficit and coming up with solutions year over year.",257,,
1686,0.97,11518.94,11523.478,"And with that, I'll turn it back to the chair.",257,,
1687,0.97,11523.478,11523.845,"Okay, great.",258,,
1688,0.97,11523.979,11524.446,So thanks for sharing.,258,,
1689,0.97,11524.446,11537.525,"And I think you can take down those numbers, because it's all still in development in one big caveat that I would NOTE is we still want to see what the impact of the inflationary adjustment would be.",258,,
1690,0.97,11537.525,11543.832,So that is a critical piece in plugging into these final scenario slides here.,258,,
1691,0.97,11543.832,11557.312,"But with that, it is one way for us to signal that I think that we are all interested in avoiding austerity, maintaining the integrity of jump start, and continuing to look at these longer-term solutions.",258,,
1692,0.97,11557.312,11558.58,"Councilmember Herbold, you have been very patient.",258,,
1693,0.97,11558.58,11560.482,So I will turn it over to you.,258,,
1694,0.97,11560.482,11561.182,Thanks.,259,,
1695,0.97,11561.182,11565.654,"I appreciate learning about your proposal, Madam chair.",259,,
1696,0.97,11565.654,11568.657,I do have just two quick questions about the prior presentation.,259,,
1697,0.97,11568.657,11574.829,But before I move to them.,259,,
1698,0.97,11574.829,11580.869,I want to take this opportunity to signal flexibility for 2023 and 2024 only.,259,,
1699,0.97,11581.002,11587.309,Some portion of revenue that comes in over expectations.,259,,
1700,0.97,11587.442,11597.852,To sustain city functions that we can continue to do Non- austerity budgeting.,259,,
1701,0.97,11597.852,11602.19,We always have to be cognizant to put boundaries on this approach.,259,,
1702,0.97,11602.19,11617.839,"We're facing a long-term structural problem that must be served for new progressive revenue, so we don't have an Overreliance on revenue that, we've already expressed a commitment for, to feel significant new investments in affordable housing.",259,,
1703,0.97,11617.839,11622.944,"And I'm hoping that letter that you Referenced, Madam chair, is in all of our Inboxes.",259,,
1704,0.97,11622.944,11627.716,"And if not, if you don't mind sending it, that would be great.",259,,
1705,0.97,11627.716,11628.149,Two quick questions.,259,,
1706,0.97,11628.283,11632.988,One about slide nine.,259,,
1707,0.97,11632.988,11634.456,And the other about slide eight.,259,,
1708,0.97,11634.456,11635.323,And I'm sorry.,259,,
1709,0.97,11635.323,11642.43,I know I asked this question in my saying this committee meeting.,259,,
1710,0.97,11642.43,11646.534,But I just want to confirm again for myself and for the viewing public.,259,,
1711,0.97,11646.735,11684.406,"The projected starting balance, well, I guess I should say of say the 2022 operating surplus and 2023 projected starting balance on slide 9. it's my recollection that neither of has include Underspend nor any of the planned spending holds from 2022 and I just--I know as it relates to Underspend.",259,,
1712,0.97,11684.406,11687.475,"We rarely get that information, until we get the budget.",259,,
1713,0.97,11687.609,11702.824,"But the reporting on the projected revenues, I think, thus far, has not talked a lot about the work that the Council has been doing with CBO.",259,,
1714,0.97,11702.824,11707.295,To do some planned spending hold for 2022.,259,,
1715,0.97,11707.295,11727.215,"And what that does is it by holding some spending for 2022, that allows us both to reduce the baseline for 2023 as well as to carry over more funds two 2022.",259,,
1716,0.97,11727.215,11737.592,"And just wanted to, for myself and for the record, just know whether or not this chart on slide 9 reflects that.",259,,
1717,0.97,11737.592,11742.063,"Thanks for the question vice chair, Erbold.",260,,
1718,0.97,11742.063,11754.843,So these numbers do not include any assumption about Undersend spend in the current budget.,260,,
1719,0.97,11754.843,11757.312,Either from natural spend or old hoes in place.,260,,
1720,0.97,11757.312,11775.697,"With regards to the impact of that in future year, my initial assumption, would be that those items are only being held on a one-time basis and if there are ongoing.",260,,
1721,0.97,11775.697,11787.108,"It would not be held N. future years, we are considering that as actually part of the projection ad growing in future years but I don't know the detail on specifically what those are.",260,,
1722,0.97,11787.108,11791.346,"When you said future years, you mean beyond 2023?",261,,
1723,0.97,11791.346,11797.318,"We are sort of behind the scenes, considering them, but not reflected here for 2023?",261,,
1724,0.97,11797.318,11799.22,Correct.,262,,
1725,0.97,11799.22,11800.388,Yeah.,263,,
1726,0.97,11800.388,11814.769,"Council member Herbold, if I may just add in if we assumed reduced expenditures, you would see 2023 is slightly in the black in the scenario.",263,,
1727,0.97,11814.769,11821.442,But it wouldn't improve the Outyears as Tom described for any outgoing expenditures.,263,,
1728,0.97,11821.442,11828.349,I will just note that there are still 2022 issues that the budget office is hearing about from departments with some increased costs.,263,,
1729,0.97,11828.349,11841.262,"So there are a lot of moving pieces, which is why they are not yet projecting that sort of Underspend.",263,,
1730,0.97,11841.262,11843.731,"And director Dingley, please correct me if I'm wrong there.",263,,
1731,0.97,11843.731,11859.147,"Which is why we included the $20 million assumption in Council chair Mosqueda's scenario, that based on previous years Underspending, it may be a bit conservative be, but it is hard to predict that now.",263,,
1732,0.97,11859.147,11863.451,So we are trying to show a conservative submit estimate.,263,,
1733,0.97,11863.585,11871.492,"And as director Dingley and the executive team, collect more information from departments in the next couple of weeks to finalize the budget.",263,,
1734,0.97,11871.492,11881.302,"It is, I am assuming that the proposed budget would likely have some Underspend Sawrchlsz, unless they decide to release the holds on any of that spending.",263,,
1735,0.97,11881.302,11884.572,Super helpful.,264,,
1736,0.97,11884.572,11886.908,Thank you.,264,,
1737,0.97,11886.908,11887.609,And my second question.,265,,
1738,0.97,11887.609,11888.309,Just real quick on that.,266,,
1739,0.97,11888.443,11894.549,"Director Dingley, did you have something you wanted to add to the Councilmember's question.",266,,
1740,0.97,11894.549,11899.12,"Just to confirm what Aly said, we are in the midst of a lot of these decisions.",267,,
1741,0.97,11899.12,11903.324,So we're learning a lot about what updating this plan looks like this time of year.,267,,
1742,0.97,11903.324,11907.095,"And part of that is imperfect information, frankly.",267,,
1743,0.97,11907.095,11915.57,So we still just don't have enough information to project out for 2022 just yet.,267,,
1744,0.97,11915.57,11919.707,But Yeah just putting that on Aly's comments.,267,,
1745,0.97,11919.707,11923.278,And I completely understand that on the Underspend.,268,,
1746,0.97,11923.278,11926.314,And new things that have been arisen.,268,,
1747,0.97,11926.314,11934.222,I'm just expressing sort of an interest in more transparency around the old of holds.,268,,
1748,0.97,11934.222,11941.029,"Again, we've made tough decisions this year, about those holds.",268,,
1749,0.97,11941.029,11945.4,And when it's reporting on these financial plans.,268,,
1750,0.97,11945.4,11969.257,"And it focuses on the deficit, which is an important thing that we have to wrestle with, not just for this year, but for the long term, without reflecting that difficult work that we did this year to not stand in the way of the executive holding almost $20 million in spending that the Council planned.",268,,
1751,0.97,11969.257,11975.697,I just--it makes me want to--make sure that that is also reflected in this planning work.,268,,
1752,0.97,11975.897,11980.101,"Again, understand that there is definitely more to come.",268,,
1753,0.97,11980.101,11983.304,My second question.,269,,
1754,0.97,11983.304,11995.316,Might be another example of me beating the proverbial dead horse on slide 14.,269,,
1755,0.97,11995.316,11997.618,They can position exercise.,269,,
1756,0.97,11997.618,12001.322,"Really, appreciate that this work is under way.",269,,
1757,0.97,12001.322,12011.099,"I have expressed in the past, how important it is for us all to get Realtime insight into places that are budgeted but not filled.",269,,
1758,0.97,12011.099,12028.783,"And therefore, another likely area for Underspend and this is even more important, I think, during the great resignation, where it's more difficult to fill funded positions.",269,,
1759,0.97,12028.783,12037.091,I understand the picture we have here is not quite as clear as we have Aspirationally expressed our hopes for.,269,,
1760,0.97,12037.091,12045.967,"And that by design, we want to keep some positions that are vacant but funded.",269,,
1761,0.97,12045.967,12047.001,We want to hold them.,269,,
1762,0.97,12047.001,12049.47,We don't want to--but it's again.,269,,
1763,0.97,12049.47,12057.245,"We still want the information about them, because without suggesting we want to cut them.",269,,
1764,0.97,12057.245,12067.588,Because we do recognize that the funding in some of these positions is necessary to support more than average work force in a particular division.,269,,
1765,0.97,12067.855,12075.463,But I just want to express my hope at having more information about vacant positions.,269,,
1766,0.97,12075.596,12078.066,Tell be forthcoming.,269,,
1767,0.97,12078.066,12109.897,"Because it's really valuable for Council, as we begin our deliberations on budget and just wondering if you could say anything more about your insights or information that you expect to be available as it relates to the review of vacant positions and our efforts to bring the budgets to conversation, instead of what the next step that will need to be taken to make this information more accessible.",269,,
1768,0.97,12109.897,12111.599,Thanks.,269,,
1769,0.97,12111.599,12117.305,"Is it all right, chair Fi jump in to respond?",270,,
1770,0.97,12117.305,12117.538,Yes.,271,,
1771,0.97,12117.538,12119.574,Thank you.,272,,
1772,0.97,12119.707,12121.843,"Those are great questions, Councilmember Herbold.",272,,
1773,0.97,12121.843,12123.044,I would say a couple of things.,272,,
1774,0.97,12123.044,12127.482,"First, we have a full Position- By-Position review under way with the departments.",272,,
1775,0.97,12127.482,12132.72,So they are providing us context on why those vacancies exist.,272,,
1776,0.97,12132.72,12136.09,"And what the plan is, going forward for those positions.",272,,
1777,0.97,12136.09,12142.93,"I would say, the holds on positions and holding vacancy Sawrchlz is really tricky from budgeting perspective.",272,,
1778,0.97,12142.93,12146.334,"It's a great sort of one-time, tool.",272,,
1779,0.97,12146.334,12159.814,But unless it's coupled with a conversation around actually changing the lines of business and expectations around and what it's doing to the community.,272,,
1780,0.97,12159.814,12164.352,It's not something that can be done Sustainably in an ongoing way.,272,,
1781,0.97,12164.352,12171.759,So it's definitely something that we are absolutely using through this proposed budget.,272,,
1782,0.97,12171.759,12172.994,It's not telling tales out of school.,272,,
1783,0.97,12172.994,12176.531,I think you'd be surprised if I wasn't using that as a tool.,272,,
1784,0.97,12176.531,12182.503,It is really important that we keep an eye to our expectations around service delivery overall.,272,,
1785,0.97,12182.503,12183.07,So that's one piece.,272,,
1786,0.97,12183.07,12189.744,"The other thing I would say is, Thatvacancies in the the only story.",272,,
1787,0.97,12189.744,12199.487,We have been working with the city Finance division on tools to enhance monitoring across departments.,272,,
1788,0.97,12199.487,12203.491,So we have now with our Newish financial management systems.,272,,
1789,0.97,12203.491,12205.026,It's about four years old.,272,,
1790,0.97,12205.026,12207.728,"But with the pandemic, it still feels new.",272,,
1791,0.97,12207.728,12214.368,We have a lot more data now.,272,,
1792,0.97,12214.368,12217.238,We have closer to Realtime Department spending.,272,,
1793,0.97,12217.238,12237.291,"Rolling out tools to help build out that accountability, and active management any literacy throughout the organization, managers up to executives, to be able to track how they're doing in Realtime.",272,,
1794,0.97,12237.291,12243.464,We can have those accountability with Finance and budget departments together.,272,,
1795,0.97,12243.464,12247.201,"Soto say, this doesn't match our expectations, what's going on here.",272,,
1796,0.97,12247.201,12253.507,"And provides more information sooner, so that we're in less of a Reactive posture.",272,,
1797,0.97,12253.507,12255.276,That's a goal.,272,,
1798,0.97,12255.276,12257.011,That's a big-time change management effort.,272,,
1799,0.97,12257.011,12258.846,So it's going to take us time to get there.,272,,
1800,0.97,12258.846,12270.858,"But I wanted to, you know, share, that we are putting the tools in place now, and starting those Trainings throughout the city, so that we can start that utilization, and then start robust monitoring, moving forward.",272,,
1801,0.97,12270.858,12276.831,"And hopefully, the goal is, over time, as you heard from central staff, we're going to right the ship.",272,,
1802,0.97,12276.831,12279.2,It is going to take us sometime to get there.,272,,
1803,0.97,12279.2,12282.27,But appreciate the grace and patience that everyone has shown.,272,,
1804,0.97,12282.27,12286.774,"And the support, frankly, for rolling out those tools.",272,,
1805,0.97,12286.774,12289.31,Like Tom has an answer as well.,273,,
1806,0.97,12289.31,12289.944,"Go ahead, Tom.",273,,
1807,0.97,12289.944,12291.145,"Thank you, Madam chair.",274,,
1808,0.97,12291.145,12299.287,And just to kind of build on director Dingley's response and to provide insight for the committee.,274,,
1809,0.97,12299.287,12301.889,The vacancy question is important to central staff analysis.,274,,
1810,0.97,12302.023,12313.567,And one of the budget questions that we are envisioning at this point in time is something that compares the cost of supporting the Currently-Filled positions with the budget amount.,274,,
1811,0.97,12313.567,12318.072,So it's kind of approaching the vacancy question from a slightly different angle.,274,,
1812,0.97,12318.072,12322.143,"So it's basically saying, how much do you need to pay for the positions you have filled?",274,,
1813,0.97,12322.143,12322.71,What is the budget?,274,,
1814,0.97,12322.71,12326.147,And what is the difference?,274,,
1815,0.97,12326.147,12329.684,"And in some cases, there may be insufficient budgets to fill the systems.",274,,
1816,0.97,12329.684,12331.318,But others will be the other way.,274,,
1817,0.97,12331.318,12339.927,"There will be more budget authority then, is required to fill those currently supported positions.",274,,
1818,0.97,12339.927,12346.334,Hopefully this will provide the right level of information for Council's decisions this fall.,274,,
1819,0.97,12346.334,12348.769,"Thank you, both.",275,,
1820,0.97,12348.769,12349.336,Appreciate that.,275,,
1821,0.97,12349.336,12354.141,And I'll underscore that that has been a constant point of conversation as well for me.,276,,
1822,0.97,12354.342,12360.881,Recognizing that we continue to put additional money into positions that are not filled and then that money rolls over.,276,,
1823,0.97,12360.881,12365.619,"So looking forward to working with all of you, as we continue to address this.",276,,
1824,0.97,12365.619,12390.444,"Please, please note that the caveat, along with the scenario, that we outline was just to provide some assurance that we are looking at highway that how that would impact our existing revenue spend plan Andenting to first maintain the investments as codified in 2020, in terms of amounts and spending categories.",276,,
1825,0.97,12390.444,12394.982,So that is the thing that I really wanted folks to see.,276,,
1826,0.97,12394.982,12395.95,That those investments are maintained.,276,,
1827,0.97,12395.95,12405.726,"Ask that there is going to be the potential if the scenario does continue to get analyzed for us to use, a Higher-Than- anticipated returns.",276,,
1828,0.97,12405.726,12410.264,"Only that amount for only two years, to then help with preventing austerity.",276,,
1829,0.97,12410.264,12415.236,"Much more analysis is needed, though, to continue to look at the impact of inflation, for example.",276,,
1830,0.97,12415.236,12419.406,And some other issues that we may want to factor in.,276,,
1831,0.97,12419.406,12424.011,"So please NOTE the Asterisk, next to this conversation that we had, which is much more work is to be done.",276,,
1832,0.97,12424.011,12443.33,"But I wanted to let folks know in a transparent way, in partnership with many of the Stakeholders from jump start progressive revenue coalition, that there is a shared interest in both preserving the spending plan and preventing against austerity in the very short term.",276,,
1833,0.97,12443.33,12450.771,"So more work to be done on that, with the Asterisk there that there is a lot of analysis still to be done.",276,,
1834,0.97,12450.771,12452.54,Any additional comments on this?,276,,
1835,0.97,12452.54,12453.24,We are over 1:00 P.M.,276,,
1836,0.97,12453.24,12457.144,So I want to thank you for your shared interest in the questions.,276,,
1837,0.97,12457.144,12459.48,And the presentations today.,276,,
1838,0.97,12459.48,12463.851,"Our next committee meeting will be September 7th, at 9:30 A.M.",276,,
1839,0.97,12463.851,12470.057,"We have a relatively short agenda, memorandum of agreements and modification.",276,,
1840,0.97,12470.057,12474.094,The green new deal jump start Proarpgzs for us to consider.,276,,
1841,0.97,12474.094,12481.101,This is the be recommendation from the green new deal advisory board on how they would like their unspecified dollars to be dedicated.,276,,
1842,0.97,12481.101,12483.737,And we look forward to Codifying their recommendation.,276,,
1843,0.97,12483.871,12493.547,"And then because we weren't able to get to the quarterly Seattle rescue plan spending update, we will have that on the last item on our agenda for September 7th.",276,,
1844,0.97,12493.547,12495.916,"With that, great to see you all.",276,,
1845,0.97,12495.916,12501.355,Enjoy the rest of your afternoon.,276,,
1846,0.97,12501.355,12501.989,Today's meeting is adjourned.,276,,
