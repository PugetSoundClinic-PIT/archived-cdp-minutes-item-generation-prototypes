214,0.97,1162.06,1163.629,I am Billy Hairston.,59,,

217,0.97,1171.503,1174.039,Thank you for that round of introductions.,60,,
218,0.97,1174.039,1181.647,"I'm making sure that we've got, I don't have any further opening remarks, if we want to just jump right into the presentation.",60,,
219,0.97,1181.647,1187.986,"Is there a Powerpoint or anything that you'd like to share with us, that we can assist getting on the screen?",60,,
220,0.97,1187.986,1192.891,"There is a Powerpoint, and I believe it was sent over the other day to go in the packet.",61,,
221,0.97,1192.891,1199.031,Do you need me to send that again?,61,,
222,0.97,1199.031,1199.765,"Alex, are we good?",62,,
223,0.97,1199.765,1201.366,I will pull it up here.,63,,
224,0.97,1201.366,1207.172,We're working on pulling it up.,64,,
225,0.97,1207.172,1209.608,Thank you.,65,,
226,0.97,1209.608,1211.61,I can also share a screen.,66,,
227,0.97,1211.61,1213.645,If you've got it handy.,67,,
228,0.97,1213.645,1223.255,That's usually what we ask for folks to do is somebody from the presentation team.,67,,
229,0.97,1223.255,1223.655,Perfect.,67,,
230,0.97,1223.655,1226.458,"Thank you so much, Billy.",67,,
231,0.97,1226.458,1238.303,"All right, we can probably jump right down to the second slide and start talking about what the comprehensive gang model is.",68,,
232,0.97,1238.303,1239.705,So a little bit about Linc.,68,,
233,0.97,1239.705,1257.623,"Really the model that it's based on goes back to the late '80s, when there was a surge in gang violence and the Federal government was trying to come up with a standard model that really helped reduce gang involvement, and gang activity in the associated behaviors and criminal violence.",68,,
234,0.97,1257.623,1263.061,"In the early '90s, they started working on the comprehensive gang model, and implementing it in services across the country.",68,,
235,0.97,1263.061,1276.808,"It is one of the most tested models out there, and has really shown effectiveness in both reducing gang involvement, but also reducing the negative behaviors involved in gangs, both on the individual level as well as on the community level.",68,,
236,0.97,1276.808,1282.948,So it's one of the programs that really has shown a 30 year track record of being effective when it's implemented.,68,,
237,0.97,1282.948,1297.129,"And we've been lucky enough here in King County to have this program implemented since, I'd have to ask Billy what was the date was for implementing.",68,,
238,0.97,1297.129,1297.396,2011.,69,,
239,0.97,1297.396,1297.663,2011.,70,,
240,0.97,1297.663,1299.064,And that is the model we have here.,70,,
241,0.97,1299.064,1301.733,I'm going to jump off a little bit.,70,,
242,0.97,1301.733,1304.036,"Actually, I am not, because this is the third slide.",70,,
243,0.97,1304.036,1309.207,"I was going to talk about why I love the program, but I will wait until the third slide.",70,,
244,0.97,1309.207,1314.78,"Aaron, do you want to take the next slide about what we do in our work?",70,,
245,0.97,1314.78,1315.147,Absolutely.,71,,
246,0.97,1315.147,1317.149,So we do this throughout all of King County.,71,,
247,0.97,1317.149,1326.758,"All of the cities represented on the slide here for Federal way, Seatac, Seattle, Tukwila, and any other area.",71,,
248,0.97,1326.758,1329.494,King County that we could serve.,71,,
249,0.97,1329.494,1330.495,So it's a collaborative approach.,71,,
250,0.97,1330.495,1336.802,"We have representatives from all of those different cities, the school districts in those cities.",71,,
251,0.97,1336.802,1350.449,"The community based organizations in those cities have a wide variety of representation as well as leaders at the city and county levels, as well.",71,,
252,0.97,1350.449,1371.002,"And like Aaron and chief had mentioned, the model in which it approaches is functional for mostly one space, but what's unique about our model is we have collaboration throughout the whole County, throughout the region, so we all get to work together collectively for our people, instead of just working in one space.",72,,
253,0.97,1371.002,1374.873,Now is the why I love this program part.,73,,
254,0.97,1374.873,1384.516,"One of the things that was most attractive when I became the police chief in Burien was finding a program that put everybody together, and put the young person's needs in the middle.",73,,
255,0.97,1384.516,1394.659,"I think often we think about community response, and systems response, and school district response, and kind of break them all apart.",73,,
256,0.97,1394.659,1397.462,What Happensis all of that lacks in Overcommunication and gaps.,73,,
257,0.97,1397.462,1410.208,"What I really like about this program is how you bring all the services that young people need tore getting out of the position they're in, if it's a negative position, and bringing them back into a good place.",73,,
258,0.97,1410.208,1428.026,"It's in that model that I have found success both because my philosophy is that public safety is really a team sport, it's not a police centric thing, but rather, it's all of us coming together around the mission of what does a safe community look like?",73,,
259,0.97,1428.026,1429.461,This program embodies that exact philosophy.,73,,
260,0.97,1429.461,1432.531,"They spent 30 years testing it, and proved it work.",73,,
261,0.97,1432.531,1436.935,"Instead of putting policing courts in the center, we put young people in the center.",73,,
262,0.97,1436.935,1444.91,"They said what are these things that young people really need, and to get back in a healthy space?",73,,
263,0.97,1444.91,1445.944,That is my philosophy.,73,,
264,0.97,1445.944,1451.316,"This program lines up perfectly with it, it really has shown a long history of success.",73,,
265,0.97,1451.316,1456.221,"Billy, do you have something to follow up with on that?",73,,
266,0.97,1456.221,1468.366,"Yeah, I would just say this wrap around type service is a true model wrap around is a particular type of service that community based organizations do to support the youth.",74,,
267,0.97,1468.366,1470.402,Youth voices centered in everything that we do.,74,,
268,0.97,1470.402,1494.226,"We don't tell the young people what we're going to do, we help to support them through that through a variety of programs that support that individual, from police, to community organizations to mental health providers to substance youth providers, education, all levels of education throughout security to counselors to actual teachers.",74,,
269,0.97,1494.226,1508.006,"We work with all of those individuals to make sure that the clients' needs, wants, and goals can be addressed as quickly as possible.",74,,
270,0.97,1508.006,1531.029,"Yeah, it's very important to talk about the youth in this [inaudible] and it's really based off their support so they can operate, and navigate the systems and spaces that they find themselves in in a very high capacity of, I've lost my words, but we try to focus on the support of young people so that they can operate.",75,,
271,0.97,1531.029,1534.065,Thank you.,76,,
272,0.97,1534.065,1538.737,"Before we move off of this, I appreciate that this is the model.",76,,
273,0.97,1538.737,1559.858,"It's great to have a graphic representation of the model, and the wrap around services, but I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about how you've developed the relationships with the institutions represented by the spokes around the Hub of client and families.",76,,
274,0.97,1559.858,1562.06,I'll jump on it a little bit.,77,,
275,0.97,1562.06,1569.067,"A lot of it is really looking at who's at the table, and who's working with the young people already.",77,,
276,0.97,1569.067,1570.035,And bringing them into one collective space.,77,,
277,0.97,1570.035,1583.648,"I think a lot of this work goes back to, and a lot of these relationships go back to when justice bridge was really building the program and Leveraging personal capital into the tables to start with.",77,,
278,0.97,1583.648,1590.021,"And I think we built off of that, and just continued to reach out to partners that are connected to this work.",77,,
279,0.97,1590.021,1594.926,"So we look at this program from a steering committee level, and say where is the gap?",77,,
280,0.97,1594.926,1601.8,"We don't have enough of a connection with the school district, or we don't have enough connection with mental health.",77,,
281,0.97,1601.8,1605.003,Then we go out and just actively recruit in those worlds.,77,,
282,0.97,1605.003,1609.741,"We talk about the story and the program, and talk about how we're Impacting young people.",77,,
283,0.97,1609.741,1617.849,"Generally speaking that gets people to want to be part of a more collective service, instead of trying to take the whole load on themselves.",77,,
284,0.97,1617.849,1624.789,We also lean on Billy immensely to go out and do Aton of recruiting for us.,77,,
285,0.97,1624.789,1625.023,Billy.,77,,
286,0.97,1625.023,1628.059,"I think, especially in this space, everything is relationship based.",78,,
287,0.97,1628.059,1638.97,So kind of identifying where those holes are for our ownerships and steering committee level and renewing that space to have those people at the table to be support back for our young people.,78,,
288,0.97,1638.97,1644.142,Part of the way to get that to work is Aaron and chief.,78,,
289,0.97,1644.142,1666.531,"We've kind of broken that into components of having a recruitment, and Retension subcommittee and having these other Subcommittees so people can zoom focus on their areas of specialties and expertise to add to the factors at the Mbit committee as well as at the steering levels so we have that from top to down.",78,,
290,0.97,1666.531,1667.732,"Did I Miss anything, Aaron?",78,,
291,0.97,1667.732,1683.782,"To a certain degree, it's a basic concept that we know young people between the ages of 14 and 24 are engaged in certain types of support, especially when those folks are coming from poverty Situationses or from housing instability, and different things like that.",79,,
292,0.97,1683.782,1693.825,"So there's some natural Folkses that we reach out to that do housing, or who do probation services or different things like that, that we've mentioned.",79,,
293,0.97,1693.825,1702.834,"Some of it is organic into when Youngs people need support, there are certain entities that step up in parts of different rounds.",79,,
294,0.97,1702.834,1704.836,So we just target those folks there.,79,,
295,0.97,1704.836,1710.408,"Even church based folks, people who are really focused on supporting young people.",79,,
296,0.97,1710.408,1712.677,We're always open to Whoever those folks are.,79,,
297,0.97,1712.677,1732.497,"Whoever those entities are, and I think not only does the steering committee help to do that, but we also have folks that are boots on the ground that really influence who we should go after as well, because there is the ever changing environment as to regards to who is supporting young people in what way we are.",79,,
298,0.97,1732.497,1748.246,"We just try to stay in tune, and continue to always reach out, and to talk about it as we're doing right now, talk about our services and try to get as many folks involved at any level.",79,,
299,0.97,1748.246,1753.985,It's also about volunteers and community levels as well.,79,,
300,0.97,1753.985,1754.552,Thank you.,80,,
301,0.97,1754.552,1758.423,"If you'll switch the next slide, I think this is Aaron's slide.",81,,
302,0.97,1758.423,1759.557,This is the on the ground work.,81,,
303,0.97,1759.557,1763.962,"This is Aaron's team, and what they're doing out there in the community.",81,,
304,0.97,1763.962,1769.567,"So our Street outreach team, the life of free program has been around for several years.",82,,
305,0.97,1769.567,1776.174,Started out a long time ago and it's moved into a program for the 11 plus years.,82,,
306,0.97,1776.174,1800.598,"These are all folks that are have lived experience, that are coming from the community, likely have had some gang ties or influence in their life directly, or through family members, and they're out on the streets every day, meeting with the people on their case levels, and doing outreach to other folks too, that are out there that would like to get these services.",82,,
307,0.97,1800.598,1803.868,"We get them connected to our program, and start to work with them every day.",82,,
308,0.97,1803.868,1832.03,"We have a group of about 12 outreach workers that are literally out on the streets at the schools, at the stores, wherever the parks, wherever young people might be that are potentially involved in gang activity, and we literally go out to them and walk up to them and engage, and just try to get them to start working with us, and find out what their goals are and take it from there.",82,,
309,0.97,1832.03,1845.143,"We have a Seattle team of about six folks, and six folks who work throughout the rest of the county.",82,,
310,0.97,1845.143,1858.823,"The outreach folks are on the day-to-day activities, whereas the case managers provide more of a direct link or connections to other based organizations, substantive providers, employment services, really anything.",82,,
311,0.97,1858.823,1866.231,"Food, housing, whatever that young person identifies as a basic need, the case managers help provide, connect to those services.",82,,
312,0.97,1866.231,1891.623,"I'll just say on top of the live and free program, we also work with freedom project Washington as well, as I mentioned with the relationships and connections and community, we have a number of different folks that we're working with, and we have, it's great that we have the opportunity to work with two outreach providers instead of just the one.",83,,
313,0.97,1891.623,1904.669,"They have the team, and the team that sometimes carries folks on their own, and also partners with the alive and free team to work with young people as well, and have those hand off the services.",83,,
314,0.97,1904.669,1909.04,"Billy, next slide.",84,,
315,0.97,1909.04,1913.444,"And actually, Ann this is your work really as well on the ground.",84,,
316,0.97,1913.444,1914.779,Do you mind covering this one?,84,,
317,0.97,1914.779,1920.652,"As I said, it takes quite a bit of time to develop relationships with young people.",85,,
318,0.97,1920.652,1923.121,Especially when they don't know us.,85,,
319,0.97,1923.121,1931.863,It does help a lot of times differ from our different clients to reach out to their family and friends and connect to them that way.,85,,
320,0.97,1931.863,1938.102,"There is a model, you come in at level one, and hopefully graduate the program to level four.",85,,
321,0.97,1938.102,1942.04,"You can take anywhere from six to nine Monthses, sometimes a year.",85,,
322,0.97,1942.04,1944.676,Sometimes we have people coming in for three months or so.,85,,
323,0.97,1944.676,1951.95,But the real meat and potatoes of the work is those relationships as Billy mentioned.,85,,
324,0.97,1951.95,1966.064,"So our average work and case managers really just do as we mentioned, people often, three to five times a week through In- person, through text message, and phone calls, and just really support them with whatever they've got going on.",85,,
325,0.97,1966.064,1977.675,"Realizing that the more contact we have with young people, the better they're going to feel supported, and have more positive decision making.",85,,
326,0.97,1977.675,1989.921,"As they grow through the program from levels two, three, and four, we do less and less contact as those folks become stable in whatever goals there are.",85,,
327,0.97,1989.921,1994.025,"Ultimately, the average person we see for about 8 months or so.",85,,
328,0.97,1994.025,2010.742,"There is a time where young people have to go to jail or be incarcerated for a time, and we work with them when they come out to work with the community, and make sure they have a solid goal plan.",85,,
329,0.97,2010.742,2021.986,And I know freedom project they do similar approaches to the work in regards to really staying with folks for a significant amount of time in your lives to make sure they've met their goals.,85,,
330,0.97,2021.986,2024.756,"Thank you, Aaron.",86,,
331,0.97,2024.756,2031.529,Can you talk a little about how Linc works with diversion programs?,86,,
332,0.97,2031.529,2031.896,Absolutely.,87,,
333,0.97,2031.896,2040.671,So we don't just think that we have all the answers and that everybody at our table is doing the right work.,87,,
334,0.97,2040.671,2046.544,"We do some diversion work, and other agencies, like choose 180 that do diversion as well.",87,,
335,0.97,2046.544,2075.773,"Sometimes it is a referral to another agency that connects them there, and does more of, depending on what their agency is doing, and at the same time, both complete the project as folks come into our programs if they are in some sort of diversion program, or coordinated diversion program, we work with Whoever is connected in their lives to help that young person maintain whatever Stipulations they have.",87,,
336,0.97,2075.773,2091.255,"Some of it is more, more directly funded through the diversion efforts, and some of it is depending on what that young person wants that maybe want to connect with our program just because of connections, relationships, and different things like that.",87,,
337,0.97,2091.255,2093.991,The diversion is a huge piece of what we're doing.,87,,
338,0.97,2093.991,2123.321,"What we've been doing, I think now is the climate we're owning it in a Differen way to where we were doing diversion before without having it officially called diversion, now we have other funding and dedicated sources to where diversion work is more highly focused, especially when we're trying to not House young people in Incarceration, especially in lower level offenses.",87,,
339,0.97,2123.321,2123.721,Thank you.,88,,
340,0.97,2123.721,2146.244,"Just to Piggyback on, we've also in the past been the partner for diversion because of voluntary programs, maybe a youth may or may not qualify, but if they're in Linc, they'll let them go to choose or let them do something else through that route.",89,,
341,0.97,2146.244,2153.284,We've also been kind of like--[no Audio],89,,
342,0.97,2153.284,2155.786,Did we lose Billy again?,90,,
343,0.97,2155.786,2158.356,I think we might have.,91,,
344,0.97,2158.356,2161.025,"He was saying something brilliant, because he always does.",92,,
345,0.97,2161.025,2163.361,That's what I knew was going to happen there.,92,,
346,0.97,2163.361,2165.997,I don't know if he can change slides.,92,,
347,0.97,2165.997,2168.466,I don't know if he can hear us.,92,,
348,0.97,2168.466,2169.5,"Billy, can you jump next slide.",92,,
349,0.97,2169.5,2172.203,The next two slides are really going to be numbers.,92,,
350,0.97,2172.203,2177.642,A little bit about outcomes and how the program is working here in King County.,92,,
351,0.97,2177.642,2179.477,There we go.,93,,
352,0.97,2179.477,2184.749,So this year served approximately 130 kids in the program.,94,,
353,0.97,2184.749,2189.921,The program constantly has people coming in and going out.,94,,
354,0.97,2189.921,2199.263,"So average clients is right around 100, with about 46 coming in last year, 50 this year, or 50 last year.",94,,
355,0.97,2199.263,2201.732,Then 33 people have successfully completed their program.,94,,
356,0.97,2201.732,2205.303,"So really, young people stay with us for about a year on average.",94,,
357,0.97,2205.303,2208.906,"And there's always young people coming in, and moving on from the program.",94,,
358,0.97,2208.906,2214.745,"The next slide is the exciting one, which talks about what does that look like, when young people are achieving their goals and moving on.",94,,
359,0.97,2214.745,2218.749,"Before we move to the next, thank you.",95,,
360,0.97,2218.749,2231.028,"So that total youth served this year of 131, that includes folks from 2021 who enrolled in the program, but are continuing their engagement.",95,,
361,0.97,2231.028,2236.267,I'm going to wait for Gina to shake her head yes or no.,96,,
362,0.97,2236.267,2236.767,This is her area.,96,,
363,0.97,2236.767,2241.038,It includes plans that were in the program from the beginning of 2021.,97,,
364,0.97,2241.038,2244.141,"I'm sorry, these are the 2021 numbers, yes.",97,,
365,0.97,2244.141,2249.714,"People who were in the program at the beginning of 2021, or joined sometime during 2021.",97,,
366,0.97,2249.714,2262.893,"You might be covering this in the next slide, but can you talk a little about what a completion is?",98,,
367,0.97,2262.893,2267.365,"Billy, I can take that one.",99,,
368,0.97,2267.365,2267.665,"Sure, Yeah.",99,,
369,0.97,2267.665,2279.377,"For how we define completion is working through those goals like Aaron said earlier, up to a level four, which is how we measure young people's progress through the program.",99,,
370,0.97,2279.377,2293.024,"So a level four client is very stable and able to Self- advocate, and achieve goals with really minimal intervention or systems support.",99,,
371,0.97,2293.024,2299.53,"So we look at what their goals are, and what remains in need of support when looking at those completions.",99,,
372,0.97,2299.53,2299.897,Thank you.,100,,
373,0.97,2299.897,2306.237,"I would just add that not all clients go one, two, three, four.",101,,
374,0.97,2306.237,2310.775,"We have clients that come in as a one, and go very quickly to a four.",101,,
375,0.97,2310.775,2313.344,It just depends on each individual.,101,,
376,0.97,2313.344,2341.238,"But as Gina was stating, completion, when they're completed, and exited from the program, that's where they're showing a lot of positive, good choices that are engaged in activities such as supports, and really have learned how to navigate a system without the assistance of a paid professional.",101,,
377,0.97,2341.238,2351.582,"Next slide, Billy.",101,,
378,0.97,2353.517,2355.686,I think Billy might be stuck there.,101,,
379,0.97,2355.686,2363.694,Our next slide would be to talk about participant outcomes.,101,,
380,0.97,2363.694,2368.666,"Right now, we're going to show the 2021 numbers from January to December.",101,,
381,0.97,2368.666,2368.999,There we go.,101,,
382,0.97,2368.999,2373.404,"Intervention plans that were viewed, looks like we had 574.",101,,
383,0.97,2373.404,2375.139,These are all 2021 numbers.,101,,
384,0.97,2375.139,2383.914,"We will be having our Mid-Year this month, Mid-Year meeting this month, and we will update all of our 2022 numbers.",101,,
385,0.97,2383.914,2393.724,"But 2022 has been about the same amount, numbers as 2021 coming out of Covid, Covid restrictions, it was a lot harder to serve.",101,,
386,0.97,2393.724,2410.674,"Our numbers had gone down a little bit, just because it was hard to engage with folks virtually that way, and as we've been getting back in person we've seen a huge increase not only in the numbers of people that we're serving, but also with a lot of positive outcomes.",101,,
387,0.97,2410.674,2417.782,"2021, some of those outcomes, we had 18 folks that Re- enrolled in school.",101,,
388,0.97,2417.782,2419.75,43 folks have improved school performance.,101,,
389,0.97,2419.75,2422.42,36 completed probation or a court activity.,101,,
390,0.97,2422.42,2426.524,12 folks enrolled in mental health or substance use.,101,,
391,0.97,2426.524,2430.895,"6 completed mental health, or substance use.",101,,
392,0.97,2430.895,2435.199,45 young people gained employment.,101,,
393,0.97,2435.199,2438.769,Of those 32 consistently maintained those employment.,101,,
394,0.97,2438.769,2442.74,"15 documented housing, and 55 increased Uber involvement.",101,,
395,0.97,2442.74,2444.442,Which is our number one involvement.,101,,
396,0.97,2444.442,2453.918,"As you can see, all of these are types of things that our outreach workers and case managers help to complete.",101,,
397,0.97,2453.918,2458.122,This is stuff they're working with folks on a day-to-day basis.,101,,
398,0.97,2458.122,2478.209,"I would say also, adding the relationship building that we do, that is another thing that we don't capture in the same way, but seeing people's Pro- social attitudes adjust and change, and be a lot more positive is another thing that we see coming out of the amount of contact.",101,,
399,0.97,2478.209,2482.88,Thank you.,102,,
400,0.97,2482.88,2485.916,A couple things.,103,,
401,0.97,2485.916,2486.984,Mdit is --,103,,
402,0.97,2486.984,2487.651,Yes.,104,,
403,0.97,2487.651,2494.191,"Assisted Multiregional team, our Teamses that meet and case plan for youth.",105,,
404,0.97,2494.191,2504.134,And I've had the pleasure of one of of the requirements of the committee members that we partnership in periodically.,106,,
405,0.97,2504.134,2540.07,"I have to say they're very useful for understanding the complexity of issues that young people are dealing with, and the ways that you all, not only hold the young people accountable for meeting their goals, but that you brain storm and support one another as people who are working closely with these young folks, and identify and sort of do problem solving around people's needs.",106,,
406,0.97,2540.07,2550.915,"It was a really interesting, and Ile Illumative experience Partnershipping in those meetings.",106,,
407,0.97,2550.915,2556.453,"If you could put that slide up, if possible.",106,,
408,0.97,2556.453,2565.329,The numbers associated with the outcomes don't reflect--they reflect peoples achieving their goals.,106,,
409,0.97,2565.329,2572.736,"For instance, the number associated with achieving housing, or stabilizing housing is not the universe of people who are housed.",106,,
410,0.97,2572.736,2581.178,"It's the number of people who have identified housing as a goal, Ands has achieved it.",106,,
411,0.97,2581.178,2592.756,"Similarly, gaining employment 45, that does not mean that only 45 of the individuals served are employed.",106,,
412,0.97,2592.756,2601.999,It means that 45 of the folks who have identified employment as a goal have done so.,106,,
413,0.97,2601.999,2602.733,Is that correct?,106,,
414,0.97,2602.733,2602.967,Yes.,107,,
415,0.97,2602.967,2606.27,Not everyone that we work with is ready to necessarily have a job.,107,,
416,0.97,2606.27,2610.674,We do work with high school students and things like that.,107,,
417,0.97,2610.674,2619.55,"So yes, you're absolutely right to where the goal plans dictate a lot of the outcomes that we have.",107,,
418,0.97,2619.55,2626.557,"And that's a prime example of what someone's goal plan is, what we really work on helping them achieve.",107,,
419,0.97,2626.557,2639.536,So I think the real Takeaway here is that 78% of the Participantsserved were able to complete one or more of their goals.,108,,
420,0.97,2639.536,2658.655,"The only exception I'd say from Councilmember Herbold is that almost every single Linc client has a goal to decrease gang involvement, whether that's by replacing that activity with other social activities or decreasing their association with peers that are getting involved.",109,,
421,0.97,2658.655,2663.594,"That goal exists, I think it's like 90% of Linc clients.",109,,
422,0.97,2663.594,2664.428,Got it.,110,,
423,0.97,2664.428,2675.439,"So that's sort of an over- arching goal, that everybody by merit of being in the program is assumed to have been embracing that as a goal.",110,,
424,0.97,2675.439,2690.888,"Any other goals are goals that are identified to sort of help the young people to achieve that broader decrease in group, or gang violence?",110,,
425,0.97,2690.888,2698.529,"Yeah, as identified, the goals are young people choosing their only goals in what they want to do.",111,,
426,0.97,2698.529,2714.044,"As far as the 78.2%, that number has gone down due to Covid, as we were recovering and regaining some of our support factors at the tables, but it's usually like 82% of participants completed goals.",111,,
427,0.97,2714.044,2717.481,We're trying to work that back up.,111,,
428,0.97,2717.481,2718.148,Thank you.,112,,
429,0.97,2718.148,2719.583,One last thought on outcomes.,113,,
430,0.97,2719.583,2725.556,"One of the beauty of this, a lot of these are really synergistic goals.",113,,
431,0.97,2725.556,2735.632,"A young person who gets Reengaged in school is going to be surrounded by more healthy individuals, healthy influences, and all of that works to help that young person get in a better place.",113,,
432,0.97,2735.632,2749.179,"I think the things like the mental health, those are a lot of the things causing behaviors, and the other big one is not having structures in place.",113,,
433,0.97,2749.179,2759.656,"Connecting to structure, like school, you really get a synergistic effect that helps young people deal with a lot of the other criminal justice engagement activities that we're seeing the symptoms.",113,,
434,0.97,2759.656,2767.731,These are the problems that Aaron and his team are really helping these young people solve.,113,,
435,0.97,2767.731,2771.301,"Next slide, Billy.",113,,
436,0.97,2771.301,2774.138,I think it's just questions.,113,,
437,0.97,2774.138,2779.409,Yeah.,114,,
438,0.97,2779.409,2791.021,"So I just really want to--Oh, Councilmember Nelson.",114,,
439,0.97,2791.021,2791.421,Thank you.,114,,
440,0.97,2791.421,2791.755,Thanks.,115,,
441,0.97,2791.755,2793.557,I apologize for being late.,115,,
442,0.97,2793.557,2794.391,This is an unusual question.,115,,
443,0.97,2794.391,2799.496,But what I would like to know is what would you change about your model?,115,,
444,0.97,2799.496,2816.046,"What would you like to be able to do that you can't right now Besides simply expanding the program and you know, increasing the budget to expand the program, because I think we need a lot more of anything, frankly.",115,,
445,0.97,2816.046,2821.285,"But where are the barriers, and this is an open ended question, I have no agenda.",115,,
446,0.97,2821.285,2824.021,What do you wish you could do differently?,115,,
447,0.97,2824.021,2829.226,Do you want to talk on the ground level of that?,116,,
448,0.97,2829.226,2830.394,I would love to.,117,,
449,0.97,2830.394,2833.664,"You know, there's a hard time having direct support to young people.",117,,
450,0.97,2833.664,2851.415,"A lot of young people that we see need, you know, a lot of basic needs, and a lot of our funding does not allow for those types of services, so a lot of times we're having to connect folks to other places to, you know, get donations and different things like that.",117,,
451,0.97,2851.415,2869.833,"So basic needs from just food, clothes, you know, you have been able to, even sometimes even with rent situations, even though there is a lot of support that people can access those things, a lot of times families need it to be a little more immediate.",117,,
452,0.97,2869.833,2870.234,So basic needs.,117,,
453,0.97,2870.234,2877.941,"One thing that's just all going to is our straight outreach workers, they're on the ground, doing the work.",117,,
454,0.97,2877.941,2911.808,"They're usually, those are usually some of the folks that are paid the lowest in the community, so figuring out a rate through grant funding, and to increase pay for the folks, because that is one thing we do see with turnover with staff, due to making you know, $24 an hour or so, and still trying to maintain, and live in the city, or particular city of Seattle, but even throughout King County, rent is high, so figuring out a way to be able to get a higher rage for our straight outreach workers.",117,,
455,0.97,2911.808,2926.123,"One thing that I would say is super important I think overall is continuing to have folks that have influence at all levels to be a part of the steering committee, to be able to help influence where funding goes.",117,,
456,0.97,2926.123,2927.291,To help influence even with turnover.,117,,
457,0.97,2927.291,2935.532,"A lot of times we see folks on the steering committee, where they're personally invested in it, and they may work for the city of Seattle, or the city of Burien.",117,,
458,0.97,2935.532,2947.945,"They move into a different position, we tend to see a certain number of falloff or transition to where we don't have folks in those roles that are needed.",117,,
459,0.97,2947.945,2959.99,"So working with entities, with all the different entities to make sure that we have dedicated staff being able to, dedicated staff roles to serve on the committee.",117,,
460,0.97,2959.99,2970.967,"Those are two things that are really crucial to the work is having consistent folks, or consistent representation at least both on the steering committee.",117,,
461,0.97,2970.967,2972.969,I think you hit it on the head.,118,,
462,0.97,2972.969,2982.312,"One of the biggest challenges of this work is getting everybody engaged across all the different partners, and seeing them engaged.",118,,
463,0.97,2982.312,2986.049,"It's really easy, and it's worked alongside of this Build- up.",118,,
464,0.97,2986.049,2993.757,What our focus is to break down those silos.,118,,
465,0.97,2993.757,2994.891,That's what the entire steering committee's goal is.,118,,
466,0.97,2994.891,3013.343,"I think that's the one thing that would change if it was a perfect world in response to your question, Councilmember Nelson is getting people to put their personal disciplines aside a bit, and come to the table with an open heart to put the young person in the middle.",118,,
467,0.97,3013.343,3026.223,"That's our biggest challenge in any of this work, not just Linc, but if I talk collectively, and all of this work around public safety is putting the mission in the middle, and figuring out who needs to work to get there.",118,,
468,0.97,3026.223,3038.702,"That would be my biggest challenge, and the thing I would change would be having people come to the table that are in positions of power, and are willing to put the young person in the middle.",118,,
469,0.97,3038.702,3039.603,"Go ahead, please.",119,,
470,0.97,3039.603,3066.763,"Kind of the thing that I think we see from our perspective as well, our touch Poits are with our young people, and how our young people maneuver through the system, like Holistically, what are the touch points, and what are the Rungs on the ladder, in our program is a long intense intervention program, where we have people for months or years, but a lot of times we're seeing our young people in my crisis mode.",120,,
471,0.97,3066.763,3084.981,"There are areas and services that prevented them from getting to our Wrung had it been placed in earlier, what are the spaces that we can connect to our young people so that way we can catch them when they're not in full blown crisis, and we're always working to play catch up.",120,,
472,0.97,3084.981,3098.195,"That's one of the things we see as well that connects to Aaron and chief's point in having organizational, and system tie in from the top.",120,,
473,0.97,3098.195,3103.433,"Not at the individual Buy-In, so we're all working Collaboratively together.",120,,
474,0.97,3103.433,3107.103,Thank you.,121,,
475,0.97,3107.103,3114.177,Any other questions from my colleagues?,121,,
476,0.97,3114.177,3116.58,Sorry.,122,,
477,0.97,3116.58,3120.383,"Go ahead, Councilmember Nelson.",123,,
478,0.97,3120.383,3128.725,"I really appreciate what you're doing, every single situation, every person you're dealing with is in a different situation and often volatile.",124,,
479,0.97,3128.725,3137.4,"So you never really know what supports will be needed when you're trying to Deescalate, or keep it from escalating.",124,,

549,0.97,3568.197,3570.667,It took 2021 for us to plan out.,141,,
550,0.97,3570.667,3576.239,We started our second Cohort just the last couple of weeks.,141,,
551,0.97,3576.239,3579.776,The feedback from the first Cohort has already exceeded our expectations.,141,,
552,0.97,3579.776,3585.848,So we're really excited for some of the things that we've been able to accomplish in 2021.,141,,
553,0.97,3585.848,3593.022,However we do see some challenges in opportunities.,141,,
554,0.97,3593.022,3596.559,We will go onto the next slide.,141,,
555,0.97,3596.559,3597.627,Just out of the way.,141,,
556,0.97,3597.627,3605.935,"We do see some challenges and supporting the expansion of the CSO's, on more Nonimmersive, enforcement.",141,,
557,0.97,3605.935,3614.243,This is a great opportunity for us as we look at alternate responses to be able to utilize CSO's in a different manner as well.,141,,
558,0.97,3614.243,3619.782,We also must continue our commitment to rebuild community relationships and trust.,141,,
559,0.97,3619.782,3628.858,The grant that I mentioned earlier will help us be able to help do some of those restorative circles as well.,141,,
560,0.97,3628.858,3631.761,The third thing is a huge opportunity.,141,,
561,0.97,3631.761,3633.296,We focus on Transformative policing.,141,,
562,0.97,3633.296,3635.398,There's a demand for culture change within policing.,141,,
563,0.97,3635.398,3652.682,We know that the SPD before the badge is incorporating the dialogue and listening opportunities: We think this will create a start for truly Transformative policing.,141,,
564,0.97,3652.682,3655.685,I want to go into the next slide.,141,,
565,0.97,3655.685,3664.227,"Right now, as mentioned for the alternative response, we expanded up to 20 CSO's and 40 civilian supervisors.",141,,
566,0.97,3664.227,3679.809,"They've gone through an extensive level of training, cultural competency, and also Partnershipping in SPD before the badge as well, to give them an awesome new look at how we cover culture and diversity opportunities.",141,,
567,0.97,3679.809,3684.647,"We will go onto the next slide, and one more after that.",141,,
568,0.97,3684.647,3689.652,"So this is in regards to SPD before the badge, which I have covered.",141,,
569,0.97,3689.652,3699.829,I'm going to cover some of the things.,141,,
570,0.97,3699.829,3702.799,"In 2021, we conducted formal racial equity tool kits.",141,,
571,0.97,3702.799,3709.372,We're actually going to go to maybe two more slides from this one.,141,,
572,0.97,3709.372,3710.339,Let's see here.,141,,
573,0.97,3710.339,3713.176,You might be covering this later.,142,,
574,0.97,3713.176,3713.643,Looks like you are.,142,,
575,0.97,3713.643,3718.948,I was interested to know a little bit more about the change in the hiring process.,142,,
576,0.97,3718.948,3722.151,That is exactly what I wanted to get to.,143,,
577,0.97,3722.151,3724.053,"So for us, it was a goal.",143,,
578,0.97,3724.053,3726.956,This is really a new hiring process for civilians.,143,,
579,0.97,3726.956,3731.928,The goal was to remove bias in our application process.,143,,
580,0.97,3731.928,3735.064,So what we've done is we've removed all Identifiers.,143,,
581,0.97,3735.064,3739.335,"Name, age, et cetera, before providing a candidate list to the hiring manager.",143,,
582,0.97,3739.335,3745.408,"This allows us just to focus on a knowledge, skills, and abilities of an applicant.",143,,
583,0.97,3745.408,3750.88,This new process currently focuses just on civilian hires at this time.,143,,
584,0.97,3750.88,3758.354,"When it comes to sworn personnel, we're evaluating all aspects as well.",143,,
585,0.97,3758.354,3764.16,This is from the CSO hiring process in the last year.,143,,
586,0.97,3764.16,3772.335,We've already received positive feedback from applicants who have reported reduced fear of putting information into an application.,143,,
587,0.97,3772.335,3777.573,We did complete a racial tool kit for the hiring process as well.,143,,
588,0.97,3777.573,3792.555,"The other things we've also conducted significant outreach in alignment was also Inducting our crowd management, reform of our policy, stops and Detections and use of force.",143,,
589,0.97,3792.555,3797.26,A revamping of our earlier intervention system as well.,143,,
590,0.97,3797.26,3812.175,"What we have slated for one more slide over, I think, maybe so in 2022 we are connecting the SPD before the badge racial equity tool kit.",143,,
591,0.97,3812.175,3827.356,"The policy to reflect civilian staff and professional staff and our partnership on a 30 and 30 initiative, which is focused on increasing the amount of women that we hire in the policing profession by 2030.",143,,
592,0.97,3827.356,3833.496,And that is what I have for this presentation.,143,,
593,0.97,3833.496,3833.863,Any questions?,143,,
594,0.97,3833.863,3834.23,Thank you.,144,,
595,0.97,3834.23,3841.27,"Yeah, could you talk about what you have planned for the restorative practices communications?",144,,
596,0.97,3841.27,3855.685,"Right now we, a lot of the work we had done on immigrant family Institute, which was creating opportunities in our peace making circle practice to have dialogue and confirmation.",145,,
597,0.97,3855.685,3863.759,We wanted to expand that to just really use these as community conversation pieces to just talk about different subjects.,145,,
598,0.97,3863.759,3867.463,We had applied for a grant a couple of years ago.,145,,
599,0.97,3867.463,3873.336,"We didn't initially get it, we had brought that out last year, and we were able to secure that grant.",145,,
600,0.97,3873.336,3880.61,This will help us to be able to pay for a variety of different things to have community partnership in those conversations.,145,,
601,0.97,3880.61,3894.523,"But that is still going to also be, right now in the planning stations with our collaborative policing Bureau, that is also finalizing, and working through that grant.",145,,
602,0.97,3894.523,3895.191,Thank you.,146,,
603,0.97,3895.191,3936.599,"Also I'd just be really interested to know about how you, you have informed me that the, before the badge, the training that Council provided some funding for last year is very popular with new recruits, and that existing officers are learning about this training, and are interested in how they might, even though they're not new recruits, benefit from the training.",146,,
604,0.97,3936.599,3943.372,"There are several components that we're pushing the whole Department through, the actual before the badge recruits are also getting as well.",147,,
605,0.97,3943.372,3950.947,"So growth mindset is by the end of the summer, we should have everybody in the Department that have gone through growth mindset.",147,,
606,0.97,3950.947,3959.989,"We are actually having every person in the Department, which will take a little bit longer, because it's in a person class go through outward mindset.",147,,
607,0.97,3959.989,3966.562,These are two classes that all of our personnel will have gone through.,147,,
608,0.97,3966.562,3969.398,"We've actually added a component, outward mindset.",147,,
609,0.97,3969.398,3971.667,"So there's growth mindset, and outward mind set.",147,,
610,0.97,3971.667,3985.815,"Then we're actually, as part of 30 seconds to 30 years, we are conducting the relational policing component, and we're going to look at expansion of other different parts of the training that we are doing with, before the badge.",147,,
611,0.97,3985.815,4009.538,"Right now, there are very specific things that officers have noted that really has helped with just, you know, dealing with all of the things that they've gone on, more from the wellness side that have helped them, and they see these classes as really big benefits to their being able to do their job.",147,,
612,0.97,4009.538,4013.576,We are expanding some of that into our In-Service officers as well.,147,,
613,0.97,4013.576,4013.943,Thank you.,148,,
614,0.97,4013.943,4029.592,"I just want to flag the mention earlier that you, I believe were on the track for having the CSO positions fully filled.",148,,
615,0.97,4029.592,4038.667,"I think we're looking for fully filled positions, where looking at I think there are 24 spots.",148,,
616,0.97,4038.667,4048.944,"You had mentioned that there are sort of a bundle of Recruitses that are in the hiring process, that are being Backgrounded.",148,,
617,0.97,4048.944,4056.952,"I just want to just, because we've talked about this.",148,,
618,0.97,4056.952,4066.662,"The Council provided some funding last year to address sort of a backlog in the Backgrounding process, which was taking a really long time.",148,,
619,0.97,4066.662,4071.167,"And that was intended, not only for officer positions, but for civilian positions.",148,,
620,0.97,4071.167,4090.786,"There has been a bit of a challenge with that, though, that in that given the great resignation, the not so great resignation, that the Backgrounding staff that do the Backgrounding have a lot of vacancies too.",148,,
621,0.97,4090.786,4093.622,It sounds like we're getting close to having that done.,148,,
622,0.97,4093.622,4100.629,I'm wondering if you could give us an estimate on when that unit will be fully staffed.,148,,
623,0.97,4100.629,4116.345,"So we've actually brought in the accompanying, which would, to do some of the backgrounds and our background detectives with that, and right now, that company has also had staffing challenges.",149,,
624,0.97,4116.345,4124.42,So we're hoping that that would help offset the amount of Backgrounders that we don't have in our background unit.,149,,
625,0.97,4124.42,4140.369,"But right now, when it comes to actually filling up all of the background detectives, we actually just brought in another temporary to help with our civilian side, which we call it temporary long term employee.",149,,
626,0.97,4140.369,4149.678,"But as far as fully staffing it with some of our detectives, that might still take some time, and that I can't give you a definitive answer right now.",149,,
627,0.97,4149.678,4158.754,So I think what I heard you respond to was a question about filling the Backgrounding positions.,150,,
628,0.97,4158.754,4165.694,But I'm also wondering when do you think the Backgrounding will be completed for the CSO candidates?,150,,
629,0.97,4165.694,4174.403,"I hope to have them in the next two months, because they've been starting their background probably about a month and a week into it already.",151,,
630,0.97,4174.403,4178.607,So they're already in the process of their backgrounds.,151,,
631,0.97,4178.607,4194.456,"So usually backgrounds take about three months with hopefully, and part of it is, each background is going to vary, based on the candidates getting all the information that the Backgrounder needs in a timely fashion.",151,,
632,0.97,4194.456,4195.291,Thank you.,152,,
633,0.97,4195.291,4209.238,Can you talk a little about the Redramatic recruitment process for the CSO?,152,,
634,0.97,4209.238,4212.007,When you've opened up the application process?,152,,
635,0.97,4212.007,4230.893,"Yeah, so you know, I think the very first time when we have the CSO's, we saw a huge amount of increase of just the people applying for the job.",153,,
636,0.97,4230.893,4231.527,"We had over 1,000 Applycations.",153,,
637,0.97,4231.527,4234.096,"1,000 applications.",153,,
638,0.97,4234.096,4237.7,There is a lot of word of mouth.,153,,
639,0.97,4237.7,4239.835,People continue to express interest.,153,,
640,0.97,4239.835,4241.337,Which is positive.,153,,
641,0.97,4241.337,4250.746,"The more community events, the more participation, people see those benefits, and that has increased the amount of people's interest in applying for the job.",153,,
642,0.97,4250.746,4257.82,"So it really is becoming two fold, because the first time we didn't have CSO's out in the community.",153,,
643,0.97,4257.82,4260.456,So it was really just getting people to apply for the job.,153,,
644,0.97,4260.456,4271.166,"But now we're getting a lot more interested applicants, because they're seeing the work that's being done.",153,,
645,0.97,4271.166,4291.42,"We continue to advertise in a variety of publications, which is typically publications like I mentioned, Seattle gay news, and northwest weekly, et cetera, those are continuing stuff that we are going to do.",153,,
646,0.97,4291.42,4304.033,"But right now, I think we should be actually filled, and we'll have one off opportunities as people do leave to other opportunities.",153,,
647,0.97,4304.033,4316.879,"And it's my understanding that right now, CSO's are working out of the West precinct.",154,,
648,0.97,4316.879,4323.619,"But once they're fully staffed, they'll be working out of the five separate precincts.",154,,
649,0.97,4323.619,4324.019,Is that accurate?,154,,
650,0.97,4324.019,4326.488,So right now we have not worked through that.,155,,
651,0.97,4326.488,4340.669,"We know that we have, in fact, they're actually out of Headquarterses, and that is one of the things that we're working on in space and the different areas as we get up to a fully trained staff.",155,,
652,0.97,4340.669,4348.043,So that is still something that we want to make sure that all of our precincts have people deploying out of their areas.,155,,
653,0.97,4348.043,4366.895,"So that I can't just give you a definitive answer, but that is right now they've grown out of their space out of headquarters, so we're trying to make sure that we have all of those opportunities in each of the precincts as well.",155,,
654,0.97,4366.895,4369.932,Thank you.,156,,

659,0.97,4384.413,4389.718,"Yeah, in 2021, 40% of our hires were people were color.",158,,
660,0.97,4389.718,4390.552,That was in 2021.,158,,
661,0.97,4390.552,4398.16,"In 2022, right now, we're actually at 50% of people of color.",158,,
662,0.97,4398.16,4415.144,"So while we are not experiencing a high number of applicants, but as I mentioned, the quality of applicants, people have typically higher levels of education.",158,,
663,0.97,4415.144,4422.785,"They come from a variety of experiences, so we're getting really good candidates that are joining the Department.",158,,
664,0.97,4422.785,4432.06,"The demographic information you just quoted, is that, I didn't catch, is it applicants or the percentage of people hired?",159,,
665,0.97,4432.06,4434.229,Those are percentage of people hired.,160,,
666,0.97,4434.229,4442.204,"I ask, because it looks like that's also tracking with the applicants too.",161,,
667,0.97,4442.204,4451.78,"It looks like in 2021, 50% of folks were applying were people of color.",161,,
668,0.97,4451.78,4460.289,So that's your hiring is sort of consistent with the demographics of the applicant pool.,161,,
669,0.97,4460.289,4467.262,"I don't have those exact numbers of the percentage of the applicant pool, but these are the actual hires.",162,,
670,0.97,4467.262,4471.033,So I'm glad to hear they are tracking.,162,,
671,0.97,4471.033,4483.946,But it's a lot of really good targeted work in our diverse communities for recruiting efforts so I think that's really helping and paying off on getting the applicants that we're getting.,162,,

794,0.97,5263.358,5263.825,"Thank you, Tia.",173,,
795,0.97,5263.825,5277.205,"And again, thank you Madam chair for having us here, and I want to acknowledge that you'll hear quite a bit from me, and it is because my good colleague, Willard Jimerson is not able to join us today, and otherwise would be sharing the bulk head of this information.",173,,
796,0.97,5277.205,5285.546,"He helps manage the project, serves as community Facilitator to organize community around how do we implement this plan.",173,,
797,0.97,5285.546,5293.421,"So to your point, Madam chair, we've had a couple of Iterations of this, but all of them are called out the data driven approach.",173,,
798,0.97,5293.421,5309.37,"One of the first actions of the convening across all the city and county groups that came together to start a process of long term planning identified a need, in which we stood up the Peacekeeper's collective, which you'll hear more about today.",173,,
799,0.97,5309.37,5318.813,"The genesis, both directions from the plan comes from a data walk that looked at, first of all, data that can sometimes be perceived as harming folks.",173,,
800,0.97,5318.813,5327.255,"So we look at the data in a clear way, leading with racial equity, as we Deconstruct the messages.",173,,
801,0.97,5327.255,5337.065,"But with a clear, clear Indisputable sense of clarity that disproportionately, black and Brown men are impacted by gun violence, both in our region, and throughout the nation.",173,,
802,0.97,5337.065,5346.641,"So as the leading charge for calling us to action, you can see both that we tied in Tia's comments that we have acknowledged that racism is a public health issue.",173,,
803,0.97,5346.641,5357.218,"That gun violence is a public health emergency, and that they are intercepted with how we manage finding solutions.",173,,
804,0.97,5357.218,5366.16,"Here we see the familiar data, this is a Snapshot from the office as a final amalgamation of all of last year's data.",173,,
805,0.97,5366.16,5368.896,This ends at the end of 2021.,173,,
806,0.97,5368.896,5377.872,"We have new data, unfortunately, as you mentioned in your opening comments the Uptick in gun violence is still surging.",173,,
807,0.97,5377.872,5385.646,"In some pocket communities we meet with chief Bo and chief Padilla, and Kent, and chief Diaz.",173,,
808,0.97,5385.646,5395.289,"While we're seeing a down trend because of the great efforts of programs like Linc, there's still surging violence and we still have our work cut out for us together.",173,,
809,0.97,5395.289,5403.398,"So not to sort of point out the sad truths, but also to anchor us in the clarity of why we do what we do, and how we do it.",173,,
810,0.97,5403.398,5422.884,"So the regional Peacekeeper's collective, as I mentioned, and will share further is a grouping of providers that have now grown to 13, as Tia said, it's an Over-Arching umbrella.",173,,
811,0.97,5422.884,5446.774,"First and foremost, supporting the work of Linc, but taking also a dynamic approach to centering folks who have been directly impacted, and have led organizations who are correctly impacted folks, we enhance some of the service provision to bring together the regional Peacekeeper's collective, which includes organizations I'll share and list at the end of the presentation, but led by the great work of community Passageways.",173,,
812,0.97,5446.774,5459.987,"Community Passageways was also serving as a leader based organization from the Seattle initiative, doing incredible work in three Hub locations in Southeast Seattle, Southwest Seattle, and in the central area.",173,,
813,0.97,5459.987,5483.344,"So taking a partnership approach, and recognizing that we needed to scale to follow Gentrification out in the areas of South King County, where people had been marginalized, and we were wanting to ensure this wide umbrella, we have high intensity engagement, much like the Linc project.",173,,
814,0.97,5483.344,5503.197,"But we also stood up for critical incident response, led by a lasting legacy of some of the work that chief Diaz helped stand up years ago to create a system and approach to reviewing that data, and ensuring through one way communication, that community had the information they needed to provide crisis response.",173,,
815,0.97,5503.197,5511.138,"Wrap around care, much like the Linc project, expanding on that.",173,,
816,0.97,5511.138,5520.481,"Centering youth and families, we're very proud to see the work of Linc, and also to showcase these are shared methods of practice.",173,,
817,0.97,5520.481,5527.388,We also took a very strategic approach.,173,,
818,0.97,5527.388,5536.13,"We have a referral strategy to Encatch those young people and help support them, so perhaps we can prevent the next incident of violence.",173,,
819,0.97,5536.13,5539.567,"Decreased negative law enforcement contact, understanding that law enforcement has a work to do.",173,,
820,0.97,5539.567,5559.186,"We're all part of the public safety framework, but our young people were disproportionately contacted by police, and this provides the programs like link and other programs we'll mention later to be able to support those young people so they don't deepen their involvement in the justice system.",173,,
821,0.97,5559.186,5566.761,"Additional community capacity, and community outreach, public awareness, restorative events, we'll talk a little bit more about us as we move forward.",173,,
822,0.97,5566.761,5580.541,"I'll gloss through this, but I think I want to highlight we take a based approach, one of the things, working with justice bridge, I founded the alive and free program.",173,,
823,0.97,5580.541,5586.747,"It's great to see its legacy, and it continued it's work as a link program.",173,,
824,0.97,5586.747,5590.985,It's incredible to see it growing throughout King County.,173,,
825,0.97,5590.985,5596.324,"But a place based strategy is, clearly necessary.",173,,
826,0.97,5596.324,5601.262,"So cities of Auburn, Kent, and Tukwila need their place based services.",173,,
827,0.97,5601.262,5615.109,They need to be culturally responsive place based services driven by the community of folks that are closest to the problem and often closest to the solution as what we call incredible messenger approach.,173,,
828,0.97,5615.109,5622.216,"We put in the word hot spots, but part of the work we may do, though it may mirror law enforcement is distinct and different.",173,,
829,0.97,5622.216,5638.332,"Yesterday the President signed a bill into effect that looked at a certain target approaches, nd this is a part of a Holistic strategy that are Community-Led throughout the country had a are aligned with those practices.",173,,
830,0.97,5638.332,5653.948,"Hot spot community directly into the communities that are identified to us as having a high impact of gun violence and building strategy together with community, and you can see some of those Pieceses listed out here.",173,,
831,0.97,5653.948,5670.931,"Finally, what's imperative, and I think arcs throughout our region, and one of the Reasonses as Dennis mentioned that we are selected by the White House for our regional approach to provide part of a peer network, learning community which they're calling civic.",173,,
832,0.97,5670.931,5679.34,That group is all informed in the same practices in sharing these Learnings and practices.,173,,
833,0.97,5679.34,5687.615,"Compassion-Based care, that is trauma informed and emphasizes solution, is what we believe to be the best across the nation.",173,,
834,0.97,5687.615,5698.192,"I think I missed the point that you were trying to make about the fact that hot spots is in parentheses, or quotation marks.",174,,
835,0.97,5698.192,5713.808,"Simply because it is a law enforcement strategy and while we are aligned, we want to be clear that that is distinctly a law enforcement strategy, and that we are Mirroring some of the approach, if that makes sense.",175,,
836,0.97,5713.808,5738.933,"I also want to flag, I recently was inquiring about the strategy of mitigating the environmental conditions around places, hot spots, you know.",176,,
837,0.97,5738.933,5775.903,"I think when talking about these issues and how we can help as elected officials, as representatives of government, there aren't often concrete things beyond funding programs that we can hope and look for the data that show that they work, that we can do but when it comes to making physical directions that can improve the physical conditions where this is happening and reduce the likelihood, I'm very interested in supporting that work.",176,,
838,0.97,5775.903,5800.628,"So I would be very interested to know more about the assessment of physical conditions in the areas that you're focused on here in Seattle, and talking with my colleagues to figure out how we can support making those changes as needed, or finding out where it is in the sort of city bureaucracy process of dealing with those things.",176,,
839,0.97,5800.628,5805.933,"If it would be appropriate, Madam chair, I would love to make sure we follow up, and bring some information to you.",177,,
840,0.97,5805.933,5810.805,We have some really great data and some strategies that have been highly Affective.,177,,
841,0.97,5810.805,5824.185,"There's also a Federal grant through the burn grants right now, through office of justice that align with these strategies that do environmental remediation and partner law enforcement with community to address strategy.",177,,
842,0.97,5824.185,5834.562,"I'm also noting an Email from you, and please forgive my delay, we had a couple of emergencies that talk about one of those key Locationses.",177,,
843,0.97,5834.562,5845.239,"If it's appropriate, we can circle back in the conversation here, or we can bring forward information for you in partnership with the city of Seattle partners.",177,,
844,0.97,5845.239,5848.309,"Thank you, appreciate that.",178,,
845,0.97,5848.309,5849.743,Here we'll just highlight.,179,,
846,0.97,5849.743,5851.879,"As I mentioned, you're hearing too much from me today.",179,,
847,0.97,5851.879,5865.793,"I want to just be clear, because Willard Jimerson, my colleague talk basis how we focus on the data and why, and how we Prioritize the population being served.",179,,
848,0.97,5865.793,5873.267,"You'll see as I think we heard earlier, it was E.I think it was Aaron Fox that said it was 12 to 24-Year-Olds.",179,,
849,0.97,5873.267,5874.602,This is slightly out of date.,179,,
850,0.97,5874.602,5891.952,"We're now serving 12 to 27-Year- olds, because the data from our partnership with Harborview medical center suggested that they were seeing folks in that range directly impacted by gun violence and just couldn't draw tat distinct line.",179,,
851,0.97,5891.952,5893.687,"Unfortunately, that's dropped lower than 12 now.",179,,
852,0.97,5893.687,5912.406,"And investments that could be made in expanding the strategy would ultimately help either the city of Seattle, or us in conjunction of the city of Seattle addressing from 30 to 39 years directly impact the by gun violence.",179,,
853,0.97,5912.406,5915.309,There simply isn't a service provider network that addresses that population's needs.,179,,
854,0.97,5915.309,5931.225,"This could be a model for change that could be scaled up to support the agencies that are doing the work in the city of Seattle to directly address the different population, which I know has been a priority Speechically of the Mayor's liaison.",179,,
855,0.97,5931.225,5936.163,"She is the first ever liaison for gun violence, and has done a beautiful job of helping us look at that concern.",179,,
856,0.97,5936.163,5949.443,"One of the things we have done in the offset of this, almost two years ago now, as we were designing the model in partnership with Harborview medical center, is stand up the model to serve within Harborview.",179,,
857,0.97,5949.443,5956.517,There's a couple of key positions that are centered in the Department of social work at Harborview.,179,,
858,0.97,5956.517,5960.954,They're directly impacted individuals below have had great success meeting bed side with folks.,179,,
859,0.97,5960.954,5968.629,"And they connect the folks in the hospital directly to our community provider network, which I'll speak a little to later.",179,,
860,0.97,5968.629,5980.975,"But it was the data from Harborview that helped us start to drill down our focal point of population between 100, and 150 young people in that age bracket.",179,,
861,0.97,5980.975,5982.91,Of course the numbers have shifted around.,179,,
862,0.97,5982.91,5989.55,"We're also getting information that identifies in the practice that we take, social network analysis.",179,,
863,0.97,5989.55,5996.29,Understands that a very small group of young people are often involved in the most amount of harm.,179,,
864,0.97,5996.29,6011.805,"If we can adequately support the smallest group of young people, we can also Prehaven't larger scale harm, in which this case takes an approach looking at 50 to 80 young people identified for their proximity to gun violence and their need for service and care.",179,,
865,0.97,6011.805,6018.345,So this priority population is part of what gets referred into the network.,179,,
866,0.97,6018.345,6019.012,Our shared methods of practice.,179,,
867,0.97,6019.012,6069.93,"One thing I want to note that was a great part of the participation, the Linc project shared, and working with the former member of Ahmed administration team, we were looking at how the gang intervention model was explicit that names gangs and has a tremendous body of research behind it, and is a highly Affective strategy, but young people are evolve willing, and the issues of emerging violence issues have kind of moved beyond certain labels, and therefore we were expanding collectively, all of us in conversation including the folks in the Linc project, talking about what are the needs of young people in a more Generative state, saying young people may have been affiliated or not identify as gang members at all, but are still in proximity to gun violence.",179,,
868,0.97,6069.93,6087.881,"In which a community leadership model of folks closest to all the emerging Trents Andness what's going on, and understand the social network analysis can help us to continue to refine the evidence informed practices and the practice based evidence that we are collecting with communities' input.",179,,
869,0.97,6087.881,6096.623,So the shared methods much practice here are a Multipronged approach.,179,,
870,0.97,6096.623,6111.371,"Multi-Systems of folks coming together to break down silos across different jurisdictions that question can serve our young people fluently and together, and without double- serving them there's a leadership as this calls out.",179,,
871,0.97,6111.371,6124.685,"The management in a centralized sort of way helps prevent the potentially not Overserving, because I don't believe in that, but again, double serving unintentionally.",179,,
872,0.97,6124.685,6152.513,"One of the Peacekeeper's protective model as Dennis mentioned, a understand I did earlier, we're part of the civic model with the White House, we were also able to Prioritize in community leadership and helping to Prioritize and identify some of the National best Trainers in practice to lead the work.",179,,
873,0.97,6152.513,6157.651,All of those folks who are serving to help us ensure this model.,179,,
874,0.97,6157.651,6162.322,Coordination and service delivery is really also a sort of signature of the regional approach.,179,,
875,0.97,6162.322,6172.699,"It takes a regional approach, and it doesn't, you know, calling out one particular brand or one particular group it wouldn't be fair.",179,,
876,0.97,6172.699,6173.901,Everybody is doing remarkable work.,179,,
877,0.97,6173.901,6175.102,Sometimeswhat's missing is broad scale organization.,179,,
878,0.97,6175.102,6195.355,"And one of the great marks of a public health approach is allowing for that lens to provide the research and guidance on that wide scale coordination much like we responded to Covid, and Othermentals we're able to mobilize and rally in a way that's distinct to the public health models.",179,,
879,0.97,6195.355,6212.94,"This coordinated service model that's Differenter giving different organizations and supporting different organizations to build more capacity for violence interruption hospital based, planned services and restoration is begun within the suite of what is happening within the Peacekeeper's collective.",179,,
880,0.97,6212.94,6232.726,"If you can forgive me, if I make sure that my screen freezes, I'll be brief here, as we talked earlier, and Tia mentioned in the description of our Go-First strategy, we're slightly disruptive in our cadence of how we put this together.",179,,
881,0.97,6232.726,6271.265,"We're actually an intervention strategy that Prioritizes the secondary intervention and moves to restoration within the suites of services mentioning like I did before, hospital based intervention, that hot spot remediation work, in our case that looks like weekly calls and conversations with law enforcement partners who identify those locations that are in need of care, and then our community practitioners, Partnering with community to abate some of the issues of gun violence and the city of Seattle is doing some remarkable work in that area.",179,,
882,0.97,6271.265,6273.433,"Southeast Seattle, and their remarkable passage.",179,,
883,0.97,6273.433,6283.71,"Because of their incredible presentation, there have been little, if not zero shootings in that community since they implemented their strategy.",179,,
884,0.97,6283.71,6298.392,"Regional Peacekeeper's collective is also distribute resources to partners able to hold up that strategy in different locations, and the Renegades through life project is doing incredible work at 12th and Jacks.",179,,
885,0.97,6298.392,6303.363,Those are Jackson.,179,,
886,0.97,6303.363,6310.07,"Prevention mentioned Junker younger Siblings we're in support of, though we are not funding.",179,,
887,0.97,6310.07,6317.31,We know there are proposals to fund more safe passage for schools through the safe initiative.,179,,
888,0.97,6317.31,6325.585,"Though you don't find it here, I don't want to say it's fully implemented, but we believe it's key of the overall service model.",179,,
889,0.97,6325.585,6337.731,"Then restoration, moving into that care team approach, much like the link project talked about in their wrap around care model, they're similarly aligned with the best practices care model.",179,,
890,0.97,6337.731,6341.134,In a second I will move to the slide.,179,,
891,0.97,6341.134,6345.572,I'm going to spend a bit of time here and move more quickly through the others.,179,,
892,0.97,6345.572,6349.776,This is a strategy fully realized in graphic form.,179,,
893,0.97,6349.776,6358.051,"As you mentioned, chairwoman, this is a data approach, and it goes through ongoing practice of this wheel.",179,,
894,0.97,6358.051,6369.129,We is do have weekly shots fired calls and we're reviewing incidents from the previous week and reviewing follow up care with the individuals impacted.,179,,
895,0.97,6369.129,6397.591,"We are a protocol driven, and we take a strident, and very proud approach to a protocol that works across partners that starts as initiated by notification from different partners, and the community is often law enforcement, letting us know this SETS off a chain of events that includes deployment incidents to provide violence interruption services, like Deescalation and crowd control and Mediations as appropriate.",179,,
896,0.97,6397.591,6398.959,That includes the Hospital- based response.,179,,
897,0.97,6398.959,6408.101,"Strategic, it says school based again, we're looking to support the Scaling up.",179,,
898,0.97,6408.101,6409.603,"Community engagement, and hot spot.",179,,
899,0.97,6409.603,6417.944,Everything with a solid white arrow indicate how we contact young people that we believe to be in crisis in need of care.,179,,
900,0.97,6417.944,6423.717,"So at the bottom of the wheel, you see where that turns enrollment into.",179,,
901,0.97,6423.717,6444.504,"This looks at great people who are Strategying what service organization is the best fit for the young person and making referral perhaps into the Linc program or to the provider network, where they will receive services that are focused on life coaching an affirmation.",179,,
902,0.97,6444.504,6463.156,"Those services are provided in a team approach that Putses an outreach worker, some organizations call them case managers or systems Navigatorses who partner around the young person to walk them towards the attainment of the goals like they shared in the Linc project.",179,,
903,0.97,6463.156,6468.728,"Finally, Siblings support services, community restoration, and healing activities are both ongoing and distinct.",179,,
904,0.97,6468.728,6481.508,"We refer to our young people who are eligible for Sibling support for organizations like choose 180, have a specialty in working with that younger population.",179,,
905,0.97,6481.508,6493.62,"Our power point, we've shared with you, I won't go deeply into, this shares the functions of the job descriptions that live within the model.",179,,
906,0.97,6493.62,6497.257,I hope you can excuse the garbage truck passing my house and making noise.,179,,
907,0.97,6497.257,6505.065,"But these are the descriptions O the staff that are funded to stand up, and provide this work.",179,,
908,0.97,6505.065,6505.565,They're fairly aligned.,179,,
909,0.97,6505.565,6532.626,"You will find them somewhat interchangeable in the sense that as we scale up, we hope to see, much like the Linc project, and the Scsi and all the emerging work happening with the Peacekeepers collective, we've also added in Reinier Beach action coalition and invested in their work to help scale up to areas of unincorporated South King County, specifically Skyway.",179,,
910,0.97,6532.626,6545.472,"All of those are supporting the function of this workforce, to make sure they're able to provide a network of service, and a web of support for our young people.",179,,
911,0.97,6545.472,6551.678,"I just wanted to mention, the slide that you're mentioning, you're on the RPR slide.",180,,
912,0.97,6551.678,6554.147,I'm going to do my best.,181,,
913,0.97,6554.147,6555.048,It seems my screen is freezing.,181,,
914,0.97,6555.048,6563.056,So hopefully it will catch up in a second here and allow me to continue.,181,,
915,0.97,6563.056,6565.225,"Can you verify, Tia, that you're seeing the slide now?",181,,
916,0.97,6565.225,6567.56,"Yes, thank you.",182,,
917,0.97,6567.56,6578.838,"So the public health approach model, and again, these have been shared out to you, the descriptions that Tia, I was frozen on, hopefully this is showing.",183,,
918,0.97,6578.838,6586.446,I will move onto the slide that defines how the model hangs together.,183,,
919,0.97,6586.446,6589.382,The original Peacekeeper's collective supported at public health.,183,,
920,0.97,6589.382,6606.533,"Again, that is highly strategic, because the public health approach has gained national attraction since the 1970s world health organization has named youth and gun violence a public health concern.",183,,
921,0.97,6606.533,6609.069,We're the only public health Department right now holding and meeting this work.,183,,
922,0.97,6609.069,6614.507,So we're proud to offer that up to all the service models.,183,,
923,0.97,6614.507,6626.953,"The organizations in the Rainier Beach action coalition received funding from the city of Seattle, from the, and both our general funds and emergency dollars made available by the White House.",183,,
924,0.97,6626.953,6635.562,And we are also turning to Conversationses where we will go to collaborating and writing Federal grants.,183,,
925,0.97,6635.562,6640.0,Those subcontract out the service model that you see here.,183,,
926,0.97,6640.0,6648.842,Critical incident managers support violence Interrupters and outreach workers are supported by client service managers alongside of the case managers.,183,,
927,0.97,6648.842,6660.286,"They stand alone, they fit into this leadership team, and the restoration service coordinator manages the family support specialists and Sibling support specialists work.",183,,
928,0.97,6660.286,6683.343,"The medium tier here across the middle is the coordination of various funding streams feed into standing up, and supporting this group of workforce so that they can work together seamless as the team to meet the needs of the folks working on the ground at that level, and then referring them into this network that is funded, and stirring up into models.",183,,
929,0.97,6683.343,6690.75,I think one important piece to note is that I know there is sometimes some confusion about who funds what.,183,,
930,0.97,6690.75,6697.39,I think an important NOTE is our combined funding makes possible this wide based web of support.,183,,
931,0.97,6697.39,6715.008,"The hospital based Interventionist staffs, though they are funded directly by King County, can't stand up alone without the city's funding that invests in supporting the restoration service coordinator and the Sibling supports, and the folks that receive that work from the hospital Interventionist.",183,,
932,0.97,6715.008,6720.847,"It's fair to say that we are technically, collectively, we're funding in a successful model.",183,,
933,0.97,6720.847,6723.116,I just want to make sure I highlight that.,183,,
934,0.97,6723.116,6733.56,"If my slides will allow me, I will finally showcase just the list of the partners in each component of the strategy.",183,,
935,0.97,6733.56,6749.609,"You see the YMCA logo, standing for the alive and free program, that Aaron Fox was sharing today, Renegades for life and Sean good, the freedom project.",183,,
936,0.97,6749.609,6750.043,Progress pushers.,183,,
937,0.97,6750.043,6767.127,"Eddie purpose and his incredible team, and of course the Harborview based intervention team so I would love to call out Paul Carter specifically, and with support of all the doctors and social workers.",183,,
938,0.97,6767.127,6793.386,"I just want to make sure that as we talk about coordination of care, not collapsing models, but standing in alignment with models, so these organizations that make up the work of the Scsi and the city of Seattle proper, and then finally the enhanced service provider network that allows for us to service areas of Skyway and white center, and including some new areas in South King County.",183,,
939,0.97,6793.386,6809.702,"So this group of all these providers you may see the same name and you heard two of these mentioned in the organization network, the freedom project and the alive and free program with the YMCA, there Sr. no duplication of services.",183,,
940,0.97,6809.702,6823.883,"There is sort of a widely understood partnership that allows for us to expand to follow our young people and to bust down the silos and malls that prevent them from receiving Serviceses that they move, for instance, outside of the city limits of Seattle.",183,,
941,0.97,6823.883,6832.325,"So those providers are contracted, and pieced together, their whole contracts with various investments to be able to provide the incredible work that they do.",183,,
942,0.97,6832.325,6837.53,"That concludes our formal slide presentation, and we'd be thrilled to turn it over to any questions.",183,,
943,0.97,6837.53,6838.064,Thank you.,184,,
944,0.97,6838.064,6850.61,"And I just want to, while I'm thinking about it, be sure to extend my thanks and well wishes to Willard Jimerson.",184,,
945,0.97,6850.61,6852.212,Sorry he couldn't be with us.,184,,
946,0.97,6852.212,6855.281,You've done a fantastic job filling in his shoes.,184,,
947,0.97,6855.281,6859.819,But we do Miss him with us here today.,184,,
948,0.97,6859.819,6862.488,A couple questions I had.,184,,
949,0.97,6862.488,6871.931,"As it relates to the hospital based program, I think you know I have a particular interest in that program.",184,,
950,0.97,6871.931,6882.942,"The slide said that every year approximately 100, to 150 young people in the target age population are seen in the emergency room for gun related injuries.",184,,
951,0.97,6882.942,6897.09,"Can you give us a sense of those 100, to 150 people seen in the emergency room, how many each year we can expect to receive the services of the hospital based program?",184,,
952,0.97,6897.09,6903.429,"I can do my very best to guess, and I can also report back on the data.",185,,
953,0.97,6903.429,6922.949,"I failed to mention that the entire project is under evaluation into public health, and that is into data capture now, because we had to do an analysis on Ramping up the service model, and make sure it is Cogent enough to evaluate it.",185,,
954,0.97,6922.949,6923.616,So we did some readiness.,185,,
955,0.97,6923.616,6936.062,"I think I am happy to refer to you, and I'd prefer to do it, if it's already in the format of getting information from our leader, to give you a clear answer.",185,,
956,0.97,6936.062,6955.848,"I think that we are with only one up until last month, we only had one hospital based Interventionist in place, and it wasn't possible for them so see everybody, by attrition some are released from the hospital right away, which doesn't allow for time to make that connection.",185,,
957,0.97,6955.848,6967.86,"Therefore, without what we know to be the most effective best practice to actually meet bed side, where there is a moment of true connection is not always like lay that folks engage in services if they're followed after the fact.",185,,
958,0.97,6967.86,6977.57,"So of the folks that are being met bed side, we're seeing a pretty high engagement rate.",185,,
959,0.97,6977.57,6978.838,I think about 75%.,185,,
960,0.97,6978.838,6984.043,I'd be grateful for grace to bring you the accurate data.,185,,
961,0.97,6984.043,6984.41,Thank you.,186,,
962,0.97,6984.41,6984.844,I would love that.,186,,
963,0.97,6984.844,6998.458,I'm trying to get a sense of what the outcomes are for the hospital based program since it has moved to a bed side intervention.,186,,
964,0.97,6998.458,7019.078,"I think folks have heard me say before, you know we get here weekly updates on shots fired from SPD and sort of semi in Realtime.",186,,
965,0.97,7019.078,7043.136,"So both shots fired, and gunshot injuries and fatalities, and every time I get a report, I'm just, I have this real sense that I want the Assuranceses that the folks who are represented by numbers in this report are actually getting these services because I do believe in the data that shows the positive outcomes.",186,,
966,0.97,7043.136,7075.635,"I also want to ask about this particular program if the age target is increased to, I think I heard you say 34, does that result in a need to shift some component of the program itself to address what might be a different set of needs?",186,,
967,0.97,7075.635,7082.775,I think what we would call the Inside-Outside job.,187,,
968,0.97,7082.775,7083.242,Making that referral.,187,,
969,0.97,7083.242,7091.284,But what is working so beautifully is there is a network of providers coordinated to receive that referral.,187,,
970,0.97,7091.284,7109.635,"What we have all identified together as a gap is there is not a Networked set of providers for an older population, so we would never want to shift away from the organizations who are primarily University youth development organizations.",187,,
971,0.97,7109.635,7114.006,We would encourage the opportunity for us to come together and consider how do we network?,187,,
972,0.97,7114.006,7122.682,"How do we scale up this model, and build the Serviceses that older population.",187,,
973,0.97,7122.682,7126.719,Councilwoman sort of falls between 30 and 39.,187,,
974,0.97,7126.719,7153.713,"So I think certainly as that medium number is certainly true, but that is also emerging, as the impacts of Covid and the economic instability and Houseless issues have impacted folks it has been as chief Diaz reports to us weekly through his team, and our shots fired review, we are primarily looking at the young people that we can connect with, and make impact.",187,,
975,0.97,7153.713,7166.192,"We're very aware that the shootings in home it's Encampments, there's not a construct that's designed at the moment to ensure their referral into a service provider network.",187,,
976,0.97,7166.192,7179.906,We're also at least hearing routinely that there are issues of domestic violence that have increased during Covid that have been resulting in some of those Statistics around the increased shots fired and suicides as well.,187,,
977,0.97,7179.906,7191.217,And these organizations are primarily providing services to young people who we identified through that data that are in need of care within a certain age range.,187,,
978,0.97,7191.217,7194.587,So there is truly an opportunity to scale up and grow.,187,,
979,0.97,7194.587,7205.164,I don't think we would want to change what's working so much as to be able to ensure there is learning to scale that up.,187,,
980,0.97,7205.164,7280.94,"And you anticipated my next question, which is given that your interventions are very focused on on young people involved in gang violence, sort of fitting in different Categorieses, whether or not it's suicide or domestic things that may not be necessarily addressed in the same way with the same contract who would be interested in building out a model for those unique circumstances that are separate from the model now, amend we'd love to talk to you about how we can do that, and this model can be responsive, and organic, and flexible.",188,,
981,0.97,7280.94,7297.79,"I appreciate you saying that, and I think we'd love to bring together our folks in the city and are collaborating in a way that allows us to cross through the intersections that cross into our young people's lives and lead to gun violence and how we can be responsive.",189,,
982,0.97,7297.79,7309.268,I think one of the unique elements is that our vision is building a new model of public health worker.,189,,
983,0.97,7309.268,7316.776,"It's widely understood when there's protocol, firefighters and EMS and other folks are seen as part of a public framework force.",189,,
984,0.97,7316.776,7332.692,"This hopes to be seen as this first Responder, much like any other first responders, and therefore able to be nimble in responding like you said to these various issues that come up to these intersections.",189,,
985,0.97,7332.692,7336.228,Councilmember Nelson.,190,,
986,0.97,7336.228,7336.996,I retract my question.,191,,
987,0.97,7336.996,7337.263,Fine.,192,,
988,0.97,7337.263,7359.452,"Admitting the time, but I do have a question, which is do you have, do you have a formal, or direct relationship with the individual family members who have recently lost a close relative, and this is a question specifically to the hospital based program.",192,,
989,0.97,7359.452,7376.736,"I'm just becoming aware that there are lots of places for improvements in that area talking to the medical examiner, and the chief medical officer of Harborview.",192,,
990,0.97,7376.736,7382.775,There's a lot of healing that can start right at that moment.,192,,
991,0.97,7382.775,7386.312,And these families could over direct experience as well.,192,,
992,0.97,7386.312,7387.513,I appreciate the question.,193,,
993,0.97,7387.513,7404.663,"I would love to ultimately elevate the fact that our grassroots partners are in community and with community and almost sort of pound for pound if you will have relationships, not always, but we also have systems to work through that.",193,,
994,0.97,7404.663,7413.706,"As you site the chief medical examiner, because will is not available to meet today, we had meetings on our books to have that conversation together.",193,,
995,0.97,7413.706,7431.857,"So we invite folks to have conversations that we can collaborate on looking for those healing Solutionses, and also elevate the work that community members have built life long relationships and community for the folks who are often the most nimble and rapid in able to bring together a response.",193,,
996,0.97,7431.857,7435.461,Sometimes we just don't all know what is doing what.,193,,
997,0.97,7435.461,7445.571,So our goal is to bring that all together so folks know what is available and how we might improve and grow together.,193,,
998,0.97,7445.571,7445.905,Thank you.,194,,
999,0.97,7445.905,7448.274,"Okay, again, thank you for being with us today.",195,,
1000,0.97,7448.274,7461.153,I want to also thank you for lifting up the work of the Seattle community safety initiative as well in your presentation.,195,,
1001,0.97,7461.153,7483.776,"The city council champion funding, the tune of $4 million a year for this effort, and really grateful that you're bringing their work into the fold, and grateful to the safe and thriving division of the human services Department for their support of that work as well.",195,,
1002,0.97,7483.776,7511.036,"I would love to talk about Offline after this meeting, but before we go into spending our committee meetings in favor of Council budget discussions but would love to talk about whether there is a second table we can set and bring in some of these additional partners for conversations about their work.",195,,
1003,0.97,7511.036,7517.309,"So again, very grateful for all the work you're doing and looking forward to lifting up that work.",195,,
1004,0.97,7517.309,7519.845,"Thank you Madam chair, and thank you members of the committee.",196,,
1005,0.97,7519.845,7522.915,Bye Bye.,197,,
1006,0.97,7522.915,7529.622,That was the last item on our agenda.,198,,
1007,0.97,7529.622,7530.689,It is 11:38 A.M.,198,,
1008,0.97,7530.689,7538.43,"The next public safety and human service Committee is scheduled for Tuesday, July 26th.",198,,
1009,0.97,7538.43,7548.207,"Before we adjourn, are there any comments from my colleagues?",198,,
1010,0.97,7548.207,7548.541,No comments?,198,,
1011,0.97,7548.541,7548.841,Ffantastic.,198,,
1012,0.97,7548.841,7550.142,"Again, it is 11:38, and we are adjourned.",198,,
1013,0.97,7550.142,7552.745,Appreciate it.,198,,
