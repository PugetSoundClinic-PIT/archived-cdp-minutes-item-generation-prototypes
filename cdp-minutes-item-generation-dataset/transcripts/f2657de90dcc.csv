393,0.97,2275.539,2286.183,These laws only continue to harm an already marginalized community and it allows continued Harassment and violence by the very police who claim to protect them.,122,,
394,0.97,2286.183,2293.19,"In 2016, amnesty International supported full Decriminalization of sex work, and we can even look to New Zealand for guidance.",122,,
395,0.97,2293.19,2293.457,It works.,122,,
396,0.97,2293.457,2301.465,"And the people these laws harm are your neighbors, your friends, your loved ones, the patrons to your businesses and my partner.",122,,
397,0.97,2301.465,2309.006,Repealing is a good first step and full Decriminalization is the right answer.,122,,

405,0.97,2333.664,2335.8,But I wanted to add a few things.,124,,
406,0.97,2335.8,2346.977,The first is that I want to acknowledge that every person who's called in and Outed themselves as a sex worker has something that should not be courageous in our society but still is.,124,,
407,0.97,2346.977,2355.553,And I believe that credit should go first and foremost to the sex workers who have been advocating for themselves long before this bill came before the Council.,124,,
408,0.97,2355.553,2361.459,I would urge the Council moving forward to more actively engage the community that is are most affected.,124,,
409,0.97,2361.459,2370.868,"Sex workers are very capable of advocating for themselves and know what they need, which are resources to be redirected from the police and towards Peer-Led community support organizations.",124,,

422,0.97,2437.401,2444.074,"That being said, I'm calling to voice my disappointment in the city's response to the protest zone known as chop.",128,,
423,0.97,2444.074,2453.751,"From my vantage point, it seems the city has had no interest in working with these specific protesters beyond minimal public safety measures while they occupy their space.",128,,
424,0.97,2453.751,2461.959,Treating the zone as an isolated demonstration space without intentions to create a resolution inherently puts our neighbors inside the zone and surrounding community at risk.,128,,
425,0.97,2461.959,2469.867,I'm asking for the parties to meet the people in the zone where they're at and develop a plan to include this occupied protest.,128,,
426,0.97,2469.867,2474.605,"Thank you for your time, and thank you again for your redefining public safety work.",128,,

435,0.97,2509.206,2511.742,The policing of our community makes everyone less safe.,130,,
436,0.97,2511.742,2523.22,I survived a sexual assault while working in a Seattle strip Club and did not consider contacting authorities because to do so would put me and my coworkers at risk of arrest and exploitation.,130,,
437,0.97,2523.22,2528.025,There's too much power in the hands of Abusers.,130,,

445,0.97,2555.92,2561.091,I think this is a necessary step towards Reimagining our approach to public safety here.,132,,
446,0.97,2561.091,2568.799,We need to Decriminalize drug use so we can treat them as medical issues and not criminal justice issues.,132,,

453,0.97,2598.996,2620.484,I'm calling to urge Councilmembers to repeal the drug and prostitution Loitering laws that currently disproportionately impact black and Brown sex workers by putting sex workers in positions that increase their exposure to violence both at Thandz of police and those who take advantage of our lack of support for sex worker rights.,134,,
454,0.97,2620.484,2626.69,I'm asking the Council pass Council bill 119807 and 119808.,134,,
455,0.97,2626.69,2632.563,And adopt harm reduction policies that were created by green light project and Decriminalize Seattle.,134,,

467,0.97,2698.595,2702.232,Laws Criminalizing sex work have many unintended consequences.,136,,
468,0.97,2702.232,2705.369,Some of those consequences prop up systemic racism.,136,,

470,0.97,2714.044,2720.918,I've heard such laws send a bad message that it's okay to police other's bodies through force and coercion.,136,,
471,0.97,2720.918,2727.624,That's the very opposite of what I'm trying to teach my 11 and 13-Year-Old now that they're growing up.,136,,
472,0.97,2727.624,2734.198,I'm far less worried about seeing 5 sex worker walking down the ave than seeing the flashing red and blue lights.,136,,

724,0.97,4186.949,4196.058,"I'm going to speak--my remarks will be broad enough to cover both ordinances, so that's including 119808.",224,,
725,0.97,4196.058,4205.901,"Councilmember Lewis, would you like for both bills to be read into the record and then we can vote on them separately so folks can comment on both bills as a package?",225,,
726,0.97,4205.901,4217.813,"Well, I'm going to leave the bulk of the comments on 119808 to Councilmember Pedersen who is a cosponsor on that measure and has some remark that is he wants to give.",226,,
727,0.97,4217.813,4226.121,I'm not--I guess I would rather just go ahead Procedurally and do them separately.,226,,
728,0.97,4226.121,4235.998,"But my comments will be broad enough to speak to both of them, and I'll let Councilmember Pedersen speak more in depth on 119808.",226,,
729,0.97,4235.998,4245.174,"So, you know, in repealing these ordinances, this is something that's been on my to-do list since taking office in January as a former Prosecutor in the city attorney's office.",226,,
730,0.97,4245.174,4252.781,"You know, I believe in our social contract in being a community that's guided by a system of law.",226,,
731,0.97,4252.781,4265.928,But I've always felt these particular statutes criminalize conduct that is is Inok Wous and speculative that it makes a mockery of that entire system of justice and keeping them on the books continues to perpetuate that mockery.,226,,
732,0.97,4265.928,4278.707,"You know, I can cite as a basis for removing these laws that the city attorney, Pete Holmes, has a standing policy to not charge these or these particular crimes.",226,,
733,0.97,4278.707,4291.02,"Or I could cite our own Reentry report which emphatically, a couple of years ago in 2018, recommended the repeal of these manifestly unjust ordinances.",226,,
734,0.97,4291.02,4296.925,"But in truth, you know, I think he real reason for Repes back even further.",226,,
735,0.97,4296.925,4297.76,And it goes back deeper.,226,,
736,0.97,4297.76,4306.168,"And it speaks to the fact that many people in our community, particularly communities of color, have been urging repeal of these ordinances for years.",226,,
737,0.97,4306.168,4310.973,"And, indeed, it is not accurate for us to call these ordinances outdated.",226,,
738,0.97,4310.973,4315.611,"As I have mentioned in briefing this morning, I firmly believe that.",226,,
739,0.97,4315.611,4323.285,I think to do so implies these ordinances had their purpose and had their day and new realities have made them irrelevant.,226,,
740,0.97,4323.285,4326.055,"And you know, Fax machines are outdated.",226,,
741,0.97,4326.055,4327.556,"Like, these laws were never appropriate.",226,,
742,0.97,4327.556,4330.426,They were wrong when they were enacted and they are wrong now.,226,,
743,0.97,4330.426,4342.938,"And I want to thank the many community organizations, many of whom spoke up today, who have been organizing on both these ordinances and have long been educating the public on the need for these repeals.",226,,
744,0.97,4342.938,4351.146,"You know, we heard from Decriminalize Seattle coalition, sex worker outreach project, green light project and many more.",226,,
745,0.97,4351.146,4360.956,"And this is an important step, these repeals, and I'm proud to sponsor both these appeals.",226,,
746,0.97,4360.956,4368.997,And I'm looking forward to Righting these wrongs and be an ally on the work people have done on these.,226,,
747,0.97,4368.997,4377.673,I'd like to thank Camilla Brown and central staff for their hard work on getting this timely legislation together and Cueing it up now.,226,,
748,0.97,4377.673,4381.877,And I urge passage of both of these bills.,226,,
749,0.97,4381.877,4403.065,"And I'll--when we Cue up 119808, I know Councilmember Pedersen has remarks on speaking to 119808 that I, as the prime sponsor, defer to him to speak for me on.",226,,

821,0.97,4835.163,4848.31,"Council bill 119808, if adopted today, will repeal Seattle's prostitution Loitering law, which is currently section 12A.10.010 of our Seattle municipal code.",256,,
822,0.97,4848.31,4866.027,I believe it's vital we support the recommendation of the Seattle Reentry work group to repeal this law to eliminate another potential source of disproportionate harm or jeopardy to communities of color from our policing Incars Ral system.,256,,
823,0.97,4866.027,4868.496,Thanks to Councilmembers Lewis and Morales for Cosponsoring this.,256,,

830,0.97,4897.926,4902.664,I do want to thank Councilmember Lewis for bringing forth this legislation.,258,,
831,0.97,4902.664,4907.602,We know that Loitering laws have a deep and harmful racist history.,258,,
832,0.97,4907.602,4909.17,These bills offer an important first step.,258,,
833,0.97,4909.17,4939.134,"As many of our callers mentioned today, we have a lot more work to do to protect our neighbors who are sex workers, and I just want to say as many of our public Commenters did as well, I look forward to sharing this with the green light project and the Decriminalize Seattle coalition to understand the best way to move forward with Decriminalizing sex work so they feel safe calling the police so they can access health care and banking.",258,,
834,0.97,4939.134,4949.644,"We know that we also--this is a complex issue, so we need to make sure we're protecting sex workers by not Conflating Consensual sex work with those who are being trafficked.",258,,
835,0.97,4949.644,4958.219,And we need to enforce and prosecute traffickers so that we can end that exploitation that's happening.,258,,
836,0.97,4958.219,4975.837,This is just the beginning and we've been in communication with sherry for a while and look forward to continuing a conversation to make sure that we continue this work and the step that is Jackie Ron outlined when she called in as well.,258,,
837,0.97,4975.837,4982.377,"Thank you to Councilmember Lewis and for your Cosponsorship as well, Councilmember Pedersen.",258,,
838,0.97,4982.377,4987.148,And we will continue to move this work forward.,258,,

842,0.97,4997.058,5005.734,"Just very briefly, I think Councilmember Pedersen and Councilmember Morales did an excellent job of summarizing the critical nature of this repeal.",260,,
843,0.97,5005.734,5014.009,"The only thing that I would say, just sort of looking beyond this repeal to kind of the future of the task that's in front of us.",260,,
844,0.97,5014.009,5062.957,I had the great privilege of being able to see a very moving presentation by the folks who do organizing at the Aurora Commons at the 36th district Democrats earlier this year when there were still In-Person meetings of that organization where a number of people with lived experience having been sex workers or working with sex workers in the Aurora corridor presented the challenges that community is facing and really the lack of comprehensive city services to help folks get the resources they need through the programming of Aurora Commons to finally get out of the cycle that they're in.,260,,
845,0.97,5062.957,5079.274,"You know, these repeals are a really good start, but it does underscore the need for an investment and standing up of tiny House villages, of Wraparound services.",260,,
846,0.97,5079.274,5089.984,"Of a lot of the ancillary resources needed for folks to break the cycle of being in cycles of trafficking, substance addiction and sex work in the city.",260,,
847,0.97,5089.984,5095.156,And I look forward to working with everybody here to try to make those commitments.,260,,
848,0.97,5095.156,5104.232,I think it's certainly part of our conversation around Defunding and right SIZING of surfaces in our conversation about the police Department.,260,,
849,0.97,5104.232,5116.544,And I look forward to continuing to work with all of the organizations that we've talked about here today and the great Impactful work Aurora Commons is doing in this area.,260,,

864,0.97,5192.554,5199.394,It reminds me of using traffic stops to find--to investigate other crimes that are not related to that traffic stop.,264,,
