168,0.97,1294.559,1310.475,I hate to say this but the homeless crisis is directly correlated to the open border sanctuary policy that the Seattle Council and liberal Democrats that bring as many foreign people to take someone else's home and job off the market and making donors and middlemen owners happy while not be required to build enough out of the same amount of homes taken off the market to offset he supply and demand sq of outdated obsolete rundown housing choices.,31,,

172,0.97,1353.051,1374.406,They pay off organizers and activists in further Oppressing innocent citizens being sold out by Democrats in the city council who have already Imploded society with aiding and abetting foreign and domestic crack and Meth and heroin pushers destroying lives daily.,31,,
173,0.97,1374.406,1394.326,Listed nonviolent as the city council expands the election apparatus with unqualified Wraparound services specifically for repeat offenders while Aligning cops to conduct the war on the homeless and caused by a lack of homes to ensure middle-class lifestyle.,31,,
