273,0.97,1182.814,1189.955,It is apparently the city is working hard to address these issues and our crisis response here in Seattle is outstanding.,34,,

285,0.97,1255.287,1262.227,It is time Seattle takes responsibility for our neighbors and to provide robust funding to support long-term treatment options in our city.,34,,

491,0.97,2167.131,2185.049,"And what we did, I think, built off of the study that was conducted in Boston, Massachusetts, that found that 20% of the grocery workers in a study conduct the there, did test positive for Covid, despite Thon% of those employees reporting wearing a face mask safely.",60,,
492,0.97,2185.049,2192.823,And this positive rate of infection among employees was five times as likely for hose who Interacted with customers than those who did not.,60,,
493,0.97,2192.823,2196.661,So we knew the risk was great.,60,,
494,0.97,2196.661,2199.864,And the sacrifice grocery workers were making.,60,,
495,0.97,2199.864,2203.801,So people could remain Fed and ur economy would continue to function.,60,,
496,0.97,2203.801,2217.815,And this was important to step up in this moment to recognize the hazard work that those grocery store workers participated in.,60,,
497,0.97,2217.815,2224.455,We recognize Nait said it ends at the end of Covid-19 civil emergency.,60,,

550,0.97,2457.154,2466.63,"And really, safety and health has been a top priority since the very first Covid case was identified.",64,,
551,0.97,2466.63,2473.804,Extra pay mandates shifted our focus from what grocery workers were already doing to adding to their concerns.,64,,
552,0.97,2473.804,2476.073,This is a fragile business model.,64,,
553,0.97,2476.073,2484.081,And extra pay has caused them to try to figure out how they're going to try to continue this.,64,,
554,0.97,2484.081,2488.419,"As I previously reported, independent grocers average about a 1% profit in a year.",64,,
555,0.97,2488.419,2489.987,It's one of the lowest in business.,64,,
556,0.97,2489.987,2493.457,We have been engaged in safety since the first outbreak.,64,,
557,0.97,2493.457,2494.592,We met with I.G.A.,64,,
558,0.97,2494.592,2500.13,"In China, within the first month of Covid, to find out what best practices they had developed.",64,,
559,0.97,2500.13,2503.501,"They actually shared their hazard plan with us, and with all of our members.",64,,
560,0.97,2503.501,2508.005,"And we have been meeting weekly, with our members since March of last year.",64,,
561,0.97,2508.005,2511.275,Just to provide all guidance and updates as they occur.,64,,
562,0.97,2511.275,2515.179,And that's been critical to our members.,64,,
563,0.97,2515.179,2520.751,And am we've engaged with our employees and customers to be sure we're keeping them safe.,64,,
564,0.97,2520.751,2527.024,And that's why there's been minimal exposure in our grocery stores for those facts and what we have been doing.,64,,
565,0.97,2527.024,2530.027,And how the vaccination process has impacted our stores.,64,,
566,0.97,2530.027,2536.567,"I just have to give so much Kudos to King County, and what they did to work with us.",64,,
567,0.97,2536.567,2538.202,They were exceptional.,64,,
568,0.97,2538.202,2545.576,We were able to get every employee who wanted to get Vaccinated Vaccinated.,64,,
569,0.97,2545.576,2547.745,They helped us develop Pop-Up clinics.,64,,
570,0.97,2547.745,2551.682,They helped us coordinate all of that.,64,,
571,0.97,2551.682,2556.587,Because most of my independent don't have pharmacies in their stores.,64,,
572,0.97,2556.587,2562.793,"But I also want to commend Safeway, they helped us as well throughout the state to help our employees get Vaccinated.",64,,
573,0.97,2562.793,2567.164,So it Wassa the just a great coordinated effort.,64,,
574,0.97,2567.164,2579.343,"What we're seeing from our independent grocers is about 60 to service% vaccination rate in Seasmghts those aren't as good in other areas, but in Seattle, definitely a much higher rate of vaccination.",64,,
575,0.97,2579.343,2587.651,"And again, I would tout some of that to King County and the work that has been done.",64,,
576,0.97,2587.651,2591.789,We continue to look for ways to improve.,64,,
577,0.97,2591.789,2596.894,Including getting people Vaccinated in communities that continue to see low vaccination rates.,64,,
578,0.97,2596.894,2601.565,"In fact, I'm getting ready to travel over to Eastern Washington and help with that now.",64,,
579,0.97,2601.565,2604.768,And what circumstances would make grocery workers feel safer?,64,,
580,0.97,2604.768,2608.405,I would just say grocery stores are safe and have been safe.,64,,
581,0.97,2608.405,2612.209,The Washington State Department of health CONFIRMS that.,64,,
582,0.97,2612.209,2615.479,And extra pay does not make workers safe.,64,,
583,0.97,2615.479,2615.813,Vaccines do.,64,,
584,0.97,2615.813,2622.82,And we've just worked so hard to be sure we're getting everyone Vaccinated.,64,,
585,0.97,2622.82,2625.656,Their families and those communities.,64,,
586,0.97,2625.656,2629.793,My members have invested millions in store ventilation.,64,,
587,0.97,2629.793,2632.096,"Ppe, increased cleaning and safety protocols.",64,,
588,0.97,2632.096,2642.439,"So I would just say Additionally, you know, Seattle times just posted on this, we're just seeing a real risk and concern over the cost of groceries.",64,,
589,0.97,2642.439,2650.381,And my members are trying to do everything they can to be able to ensure people afford and access groceries.,64,,
590,0.97,2650.381,2651.582,We're really watching that closely.,64,,
591,0.97,2651.582,2653.25,"Definitely, this is a concern of ours.",64,,
592,0.97,2653.25,2667.364,"As we look back on this pandemic and when it first started, some of the thing that I think we need to work together as a group and develop is to make sure that we have better access to Ppe.",64,,
593,0.97,2667.364,2671.435,"My independent grocers really suffered with that, when this pandemic first came out.",64,,
594,0.97,2671.435,2676.306,"Of course, we wanted to make sure our Healthcare workers and those had Priesht.",64,,
595,0.97,2676.306,2679.71,But really my independent grocers were on the end that was list.,64,,
596,0.97,2679.71,2685.282,"And thanks to FEMA and to Seattle and King County, they did help us.",64,,
597,0.97,2685.282,2685.783,But it took sometime.,64,,
598,0.97,2685.783,2691.588,I definitely want to be sure we're more prepared for things like this.,64,,
599,0.97,2691.588,2697.027,And that we constantly weigh the safety of our employees during this entire period.,64,,
600,0.97,2697.027,2707.304,"If my members thought at any time that there was a risk to their employees and they couldn't provide a safe work environment, they've told me, they would have closed their doors.",64,,
601,0.97,2707.304,2712.443,They never wanted to risk or jeopardize their employees at any time.,64,,
602,0.97,2712.443,2718.415,I'd like to invite any Councilmembers.,64,,
603,0.97,2718.415,2721.518,I'm more than happy to do that and work with you all.,64,,
604,0.97,2721.518,2721.819,Thank you.,64,,
605,0.97,2721.819,2722.219,Excellent.,65,,
606,0.97,2722.219,2726.056,"Thanks so much for getting us kicked off here today, Tammy.",65,,
607,0.97,2726.056,2730.561,Let's have--Call-Ins if you can hold your questions to the end of the PANT.,65,,
608,0.97,2730.561,2732.196,That would be great.,65,,
609,0.97,2732.196,2742.94,"We have three more folks and then hopefully we'll also have the chance to hear from the Department of health, public health Seattle, King County.",65,,
610,0.97,2742.94,2743.273,Sam Darcy.,65,,
611,0.97,2743.273,2744.708,I want to welcome you.,65,,
612,0.97,2744.708,2750.047,"Helped shape the original bill F. you can take yourself off mute, you do have the floor.",65,,
613,0.97,2750.047,2750.214,Hi.,65,,
614,0.97,2750.214,2752.249,Good morning.,66,,
615,0.97,2752.249,2760.157,"And thank you very much, chair Mosqueda and members of the committee for having me here today.",66,,
616,0.97,2760.157,2763.127,Speaking of safety conditions in grocery stores.,66,,
617,0.97,2763.127,2766.163,My name is Sam Dancy and I work in West Seattle.,66,,
618,0.97,2766.163,2770.467,I've worked here since 1991.,66,,
619,0.97,2770.467,2788.652,"I appreciate what the city of Seattle has done to show appreciation for the hard work between the grocery workers, passing the hazardous pay ordinance and the extraordinary work to get employees Vaccinated.",66,,
620,0.97,2788.652,2788.919,Hold on.,66,,
621,0.97,2788.919,2790.053,Something is happening here.,66,,
622,0.97,2790.053,2790.487,Take your time.,67,,
623,0.97,2790.487,2793.09,No problem.,67,,
624,0.97,2793.09,2793.69,[inaudible],67,,
625,0.97,2793.69,2797.161,And you are a worker in my grocery store.,68,,
626,0.97,2797.161,2799.029,That's where we go to get our groceries.,68,,
627,0.97,2799.029,2803.6,Yes.,69,,
628,0.97,2803.6,2815.279,"And so anyway, between passing the hazardous pay ordinance, Seattle is a leader in vaccination rates.",69,,
629,0.97,2815.279,2820.184,"Among the partnership between the city and my Union, made it possible to receive our vaccination.",69,,
630,0.97,2820.184,2825.722,While the city has gone above and beyond its efforts to keep workers safe.,69,,
631,0.97,2825.722,2829.793,They have fallen short of the same standards.,69,,
632,0.97,2829.793,2838.702,"Initially, they took us seriously, paid us hero pay and implemented strict safety protocols.",69,,
633,0.97,2838.702,2843.44,"More importantly, scheduled more hours for staff to follow cleaning guidelines.",69,,
634,0.97,2843.44,2852.849,"Around the same time, the interest is on worker safety and sanitation switched back the inference on massive profits.",69,,
635,0.97,2852.849,2856.119,My coworkers continue to do more with less hours.,69,,
636,0.97,2856.119,2858.856,Customers refusing to wear masks.,69,,
637,0.97,2858.856,2863.06,And not physically distance ourselves from customers because of high store capacity.,69,,
638,0.97,2863.06,2870.567,"Now that the employers have relaxed, more and more customers are shopping without masks.",69,,
639,0.97,2870.567,2877.841,Workers have no way to know if someone is Vaccinated or not.,69,,
640,0.97,2877.841,2883.647,Might be making Workerps workers less safe as a result of the policy.,69,,
641,0.97,2883.647,2889.052,Employers have fallen short of our expectation to keep us safe at almost every turn.,69,,
642,0.97,2889.052,2902.366,"Instead of Prioritizing the workers who have gone to work day in and day out, these employees have Prioritized their massive profits, which are a direct result of this global pandemic.",69,,
643,0.97,2902.366,2907.604,The companies have a responsibility to do better.,69,,
644,0.97,2907.604,2910.374,And you and the Councilmembers unanimously approved.,69,,
645,0.97,2910.374,2915.679,I want to thank you from the bottom of our heart.,69,,
646,0.97,2915.679,2921.585,Me and my Wocoworkers appreciated you passing that and giving opportunity to make us feel worthy.,69,,
647,0.97,2921.585,2923.186,Thank you again for everything you've done.,69,,
648,0.97,2923.186,2925.522,Thank you so much for your testimony today.,70,,
649,0.97,2925.522,2928.759,And we will take some questions at the end of the panel.,70,,
650,0.97,2928.759,2931.528,I want to welcome Holly Chi15Á back to the committee.,70,,
651,0.97,2931.528,2934.431,Thank you for joining us again.,70,,
652,0.97,2934.431,2937.434,And Holly is with the Northwest grocery Association.,70,,
653,0.97,2937.434,2944.341,"Thank you, Madam Councilmember and members of the Council for the chance to speak today.",71,,
654,0.97,2944.341,2946.476,I represent the Northwest grocery Association.,71,,
655,0.97,2946.476,2954.451,For those of who you don't know what that is and the difference between Ms. Hedrick and her Association.,71,,
656,0.97,2954.451,2955.619,She represents the independent.,71,,
657,0.97,2955.619,2964.961,"I represent larger retailer Loosic cost Co, Fred Meyer, Qfc and Safeway.",71,,
658,0.97,2964.961,2967.965,I want to address the hazard pay.,71,,
659,0.97,2967.965,2970.467,I will provide my comments in writing to council as well.,71,,
660,0.97,2970.467,2972.636,So you have those as a reference point.,71,,
661,0.97,2972.636,2978.375,"First, I want to start by saying thank you to our employees.",71,,
662,0.97,2978.375,2978.942,As Samuel eloquently said.,71,,
663,0.97,2978.942,2981.945,They have been on the front line.,71,,
664,0.97,2981.945,2986.783,They have done a phenomenal job of making sure our Comurntds have been Fed through this process.,71,,
665,0.97,2986.783,2990.654,I want to thank our managerial team for keeping our stores stocked.,71,,
666,0.97,2990.654,2992.456,For handling everything that has been thrown at them.,71,,
667,0.97,2992.456,2997.527,"And now, as we move out of the pandemic, our Pharmacy teams.",71,,
668,0.97,2997.527,2999.996,Our pharmacists have partnered with King County public health.,71,,
669,0.97,2999.996,3002.532,And with the city of Seattle.,71,,
670,0.97,3002.532,3009.106,And have administered vaccines both in our grocery stores and also at community vaccination events.,71,,
671,0.97,3009.106,3016.713,We're proud to be part of what has gone on in getting Seattle to that 70% mark.,71,,
672,0.97,3016.713,3021.151,And we will continue to offer vaccines on a Walkup basis.,71,,
673,0.97,3021.151,3025.522,And we're happy to provide those to our employees and as a community as a whole.,71,,
674,0.97,3025.522,3035.332,"A lot has changed since February, when Council made this decision to put an extra $4 an hour on the Union within Seattle.",71,,
675,0.97,3035.332,3040.737,Grocery store workers continue to not be the primary source of Covid-19.,71,,
676,0.97,3040.737,3049.579,"And that number is borne out by our Washington State Department of health, which every two weeks, issues guidance on where they're seeing Covid-19 rates.",71,,
677,0.97,3049.579,3051.882,Not just for the general public.,71,,
678,0.97,3051.882,3055.118,But also the employee and other reported outbreaks.,71,,
679,0.97,3055.118,3068.398,"And as of June 9th, which is the most recent data we have, we are 8th below traditional retail, below restaurants, below construction.",71,,
680,0.97,3068.398,3068.799,Below government.,71,,
681,0.97,3068.799,3071.168,In exposure of Covid-19.,71,,
682,0.97,3071.168,3084.915,"And as the state reopens, and restaurants and home Depot, and target, and everybody moves to 100% access as well as us, we will be the only industry by the city required to still pay $4 an hour.",71,,
683,0.97,3084.915,3091.855,But all of the other industries that will be out there operating at the same capacity rates will not issue required to do so.,71,,
684,0.97,3091.855,3106.803,"We are trying to determine the financial impact of what Covid--or the $4 an hour requirement on top of the Union wage has been for our employers and generally, within the retail grocery industry.",71,,
685,0.97,3106.803,3111.241,"Our best GUESSTIMATES, because we don't represent everyone within the city.",71,,
686,0.97,3111.241,3119.115,"Our best guess is it's around $200 million a week, paid by all grocery, within the city of Seattle.",71,,
687,0.97,3119.115,3119.716,That's a very loose number.,71,,
688,0.97,3119.716,3123.386,We're try fog get a Brlts idea of what that is.,71,,
689,0.97,3123.386,3124.921,That's based on an independent study.,71,,
690,0.97,3124.921,3127.357,That number is not one we've put together.,71,,
691,0.97,3127.357,3134.598,But I'm hoping to have that kind of information for Council and other councils as they look to do these mandates for others in the future.,71,,
692,0.97,3134.598,3137.968,I want to take a moment about the masking policies.,71,,
693,0.97,3137.968,3142.139,Because I know there is confusion around that.,71,,
694,0.97,3142.139,3143.173,There certainly was for us.,71,,
695,0.97,3143.173,3144.941,We got no warning.,71,,
696,0.97,3144.941,3147.511,"Just so you know, nobody got warning.",71,,
697,0.97,3147.511,3149.346,The governor's office didn't know.,71,,
698,0.97,3149.346,3149.746,We didn't know.,71,,
699,0.97,3149.746,3152.716,I'm pretty darn sure public health didn't know.,71,,
700,0.97,3152.716,3157.053,There was quite a bit of shifting that had to go on.,71,,
701,0.97,3157.053,3164.761,"The masking policies and customers, whether they wear masks or not, is based on King Courty public guidance.",71,,
702,0.97,3164.761,3171.101,And I want to thank King County for providing us with help on how to implement the new CDC policies.,71,,
703,0.97,3171.101,3175.672,We do have Signage that asks people still to wear masks in the stores.,71,,
704,0.97,3175.672,3186.182,"But without checking cards or enforcing a vaccination protocol, there's no good way to reduce a potentially hostile situation between a customer and our employees.",71,,
705,0.97,3186.182,3190.62,So we ask asked folks to wear masks in the stores.,71,,
706,0.97,3190.62,3196.092,"But under the CDC guidelines, if they're Vaccinated, they are not required to wear masks in our stores.",71,,
707,0.97,3196.092,3211.741,"We have focused on is the labor and industry requirements that we have been given for guidance, which is our straight regulator for employer law, which says that if our employees are 100% Vaccinated, hay are not required to wear masks.",71,,
708,0.97,3211.741,3218.181,"If you as a worker are not fully Vaccinated, we Stim require you to wear a mask.",71,,
709,0.97,3218.181,3222.619,"If you are Vaccinated, ln Hi say we can allow them not to.",71,,
710,0.97,3222.619,3228.792,It hen comes to whether our employees will still be 100% masked or not.,71,,
711,0.97,3228.792,3234.264,As you start coming in seeing our employees without new masks on.,71,,
712,0.97,3234.264,3238.735,These are the guidance that we are getting from public health.,71,,
713,0.97,3238.735,3244.14,Both state and county and also that we are getting from the CDC and laboring industry.,71,,
714,0.97,3244.14,3251.514,"Because don't forget, there are other regulators to the grocery industry than just the public health guidance that we receive.",71,,
715,0.97,3251.514,3252.349,So where do we go?,71,,
716,0.97,3252.349,3260.19,I think it's Wort noting that most of the other local governments that have chosen to pass hazard pay.,71,,
717,0.97,3260.19,3265.128,"Most notably in California, which is where a lot of this started.",71,,
718,0.97,3265.128,3269.199,Their ordinance has had hard deadlines.,71,,
719,0.97,3269.199,3275.138,"Of the 35 that passed in California, 30 of them had a specific duration.",71,,
720,0.97,3275.138,3277.574,"The bulk of them, were only 125 days.",71,,
721,0.97,3277.574,3279.142,Six were set for 60 days.,71,,
722,0.97,3279.142,3281.978,And two them were after 90 or 180 days.,71,,
723,0.97,3281.978,3288.585,So only a couple of them were tied to the rollback of an emergency order.,71,,
724,0.97,3288.585,3293.189,The overwhelming number of them had some kind of hard deadline.,71,,
725,0.97,3293.189,3300.93,"And that provides assurances both for our employees to know, and for employers to know when it ends.",71,,
726,0.97,3300.93,3302.032,If it's an arbitrary rollback.,71,,
727,0.97,3302.032,3307.17,"Everyone is on the fly, trying to figure out how to adjust wages accordingly.",71,,
728,0.97,3307.17,3312.409,"I will end by saying, is it time to set hazard pay?",71,,
729,0.97,3312.409,3315.779,"As Council woman has said, that's not for me to make.",72,,
730,0.97,3315.779,3319.015,But I will say that our focus needs to be on vaccines.,72,,
731,0.97,3319.015,3325.989,"We are again, provide to be part of the effort of King County and of the state to move in vaccines.",72,,
732,0.97,3325.989,3329.926,"We would welcome anyone watching on Seattle one, who is not Vaccinated.",72,,
733,0.97,3329.926,3333.93,Please come into our stores and get Vaccinated.,72,,
734,0.97,3333.93,3338.335,Our on-site pharmacists are ready to get you Vaccinated.,72,,
735,0.97,3338.335,3342.038,Our employees are offered Financialincentives.,72,,
736,0.97,3342.038,3342.939,Offered sick leave.,72,,
737,0.97,3342.939,3345.742,If there is a Contraindication with the vaccine.,72,,
738,0.97,3345.742,3348.078,So that if they choose to get Vaccinated.,72,,
739,0.97,3348.078,3350.113,Because right now it is their choice.,72,,
740,0.97,3350.113,3352.315,We are not mandating those vaccines.,72,,
741,0.97,3352.315,3355.752,We are readily able to help them get through that process.,72,,
742,0.97,3355.752,3356.152,And also again.,72,,
743,0.97,3356.152,3364.227,"They may not have to wear a mask while they're at work, if they're 100% fully Vaccinated, depending on the employer.",72,,
744,0.97,3364.227,3372.769,"With that, I'm happy to submit my comments.",72,,
745,0.97,3372.769,3373.57,I'll submit in write sling.,72,,
746,0.97,3373.57,3373.937,Absolutely.,73,,

748,0.97,3376.773,3382.078,"The last person on the panel, before we turn it over to public health is mark.",73,,
749,0.97,3382.078,3384.981,Mark Arbalk.,73,,
750,0.97,3384.981,3386.182,Good to see you.,73,,
751,0.97,3386.182,3386.583,And welcome.,73,,
752,0.97,3386.583,3387.884,From Uscw local 21 remember.,73,,
753,0.97,3387.884,3389.552,Good morning.,74,,
754,0.97,3389.552,3390.887,Thank you to chair Mosqueda.,74,,
755,0.97,3390.887,3396.659,And members of the committee for the opportunity to join the conversation.,74,,
756,0.97,3396.659,3398.795,My name is mark Auerbach.,74,,
757,0.97,3398.795,3401.398,"We represent about 10,000 workers in Seattle.",74,,
758,0.97,3401.398,3405.802,Most of whom are grocery workers.,74,,
759,0.97,3405.802,3413.91,"And you know, throughout this pandemic, the vast majority of our members have told us that their employers weren't doing enough to keep them safe.",74,,
760,0.97,3413.91,3418.281,Our members had to fight for safety every step of the way.,74,,
761,0.97,3418.281,3419.349,Just one example.,74,,
762,0.97,3419.349,3429.926,"Some employers initially prohibited workers from wearing masks, even their own masks, because they didn't want to send the wrong message to cust Mishes.",74,,
763,0.97,3429.926,3446.576,"We believe the outcomes in our stores and communities as a whole, would likely have been worse, if not for the support of public elected officials and unionized Partials who had the tools to speak up for safety in our industry.",74,,
764,0.97,3446.576,3456.186,"Our members understood all along, that even in stores, and best Saiforts practices, Covid- 19 presented serious risks that couldn't be entirely mitigated.",74,,
765,0.97,3456.186,3461.925,"They lived in constant fear of getting sick, of affecting their loved once.",74,,
766,0.97,3461.925,3464.761,Cried in their cars after work.,74,,
767,0.97,3464.761,3466.262,Some sack Fissed day.,74,,
768,0.97,3466.262,3471.267,And the exhaustion and stress from interacting with hundreds or thousands of customers every day.,74,,
769,0.97,3471.267,3474.037,Exactly what the rest of us were avoiding.,74,,
770,0.97,3474.037,3481.177,Took a toll on their mental and physical health.,74,,
771,0.97,3481.177,3485.548,Our members knew before the Wall Street panel first that they were making profit.,74,,
772,0.97,3485.548,3491.688,Because of the way Covid changed consumption patterns.,74,,
773,0.97,3491.688,3496.559,So employers' refusal to provide hazard way stung especially hard.,74,,
774,0.97,3496.559,3504.2,Our members will never forget those employer what refused to share their profits.,74,,
775,0.97,3504.2,3514.11,"And our members will also never forget that in community and this Council stood with them, by mandating hazard pay, in recognition of the risks they were taking for all of us.",74,,
776,0.97,3514.11,3519.649,So where does that leave us today now that we put 70% on Vaccinations?,74,,
777,0.97,3519.649,3521.951,"Well, hitting 70% is a great achievement for the city.",74,,
778,0.97,3521.951,3523.086,It really is.,74,,
779,0.97,3523.086,3528.925,And no one is more relieved than front line essential workers.,74,,
780,0.97,3528.925,3537.166,Our members initially reported a lot of difficulty Accessing vaccine appointments.,74,,
781,0.97,3537.166,3539.135,They are no longer seeking assistance with that.,74,,
782,0.97,3539.135,3541.538,We've got a lot to celebrate.,74,,
783,0.97,3541.538,3544.007,There is still fear and uncertainty.,74,,
784,0.97,3544.007,3546.91,Our members are worried about new Variants.,74,,
785,0.97,3546.91,3553.55,"They're worried about risks to younger, Unvaccinated children in the households.",74,,
786,0.97,3553.55,3560.423,They're uncertain about the risk from relaxed mask policies.,74,,
787,0.97,3560.423,3571.834,"And while we celebrate overall #Áu Scw21, believes it's essential to overrun the county and other levels.",74,,
788,0.97,3571.834,3578.107,Where less than half of black and Latin residents were fully Vaccinated.,74,,
789,0.97,3578.107,3581.444,We can't really be content with that.,74,,
790,0.97,3581.444,3582.745,Back to our stores.,74,,
791,0.97,3582.745,3591.054,"As we represent these need and s, we are going to continue to look at the data, take guidance from public health experts, as we have from the beginning.",74,,
792,0.97,3591.054,3594.557,And we thank you for the opportunity.,74,,
793,0.97,3594.557,3595.625,"Thank you very much, mark.",75,,
794,0.97,3595.625,3603.099,"And one of the first vaccination clinics I had the chance to volunteer for, was with Tbrsh store workers.",75,,
795,0.97,3603.099,3606.803,Thank you for that as well.,75,,
796,0.97,3606.803,3616.612,"Folks, really appreciate the presentation from the Panelist and before we go into questions, I do want to see if we have with us, King County public health, interim director.",75,,

802,0.97,3633.997,3634.297,"Hi, Dennis.",77,,
803,0.97,3634.297,3635.632,You are here just in time.,77,,
804,0.97,3635.632,3641.237,I know that's probably not a lot of warning to get you keyed up.,77,,
805,0.97,3641.237,3650.146,But congratulations on your interim service here for us in this Ver trying time within our County and within our country.,77,,

807,0.97,3654.317,3668.631,"And know that we are in good hands, especially with the parting comments that director Patty Hayes made, as she sends us on our way to do more good work with you, when she was visiting us with public health.",77,,
808,0.97,3668.631,3674.737,And I was really pleased to hear your presentation during the public health meeting.,77,,

813,0.97,3692.555,3694.323,You're basically wrapping us up.,77,,
814,0.97,3694.323,3698.027,And we'll get into additional questions if you would like to offer additional data.,77,,
815,0.97,3698.027,3701.864,Thank you for the kind words and for the public health support.,78,,
816,0.97,3701.864,3705.968,"I know you have been a champion of public health, since I Metture.",78,,
817,0.97,3705.968,3712.508,Thank you for all you're doing and your colleagues in in area.,78,,
818,0.97,3712.508,3721.684,"For those who don't know me, I am new to the role as the interim director for public health Seattle and King County.",78,,
819,0.97,3721.684,3726.389,I've been here for about 28 years.,78,,
820,0.97,3726.389,3737.733,And most recently Loo the position of public health County for Inspectious diseases--infectious diseases.,78,,
821,0.97,3737.733,3745.308,Near and dear to my heart since the beginning of this Pandementic.,78,,
822,0.97,3745.308,3749.812,I'm sorry I missed the other presentation.,78,,
823,0.97,3749.812,3753.049,I had on go to South County.,78,,
824,0.97,3753.049,3755.852,I'll hit the cliff NOTE first and get into details.,78,,
825,0.97,3755.852,3757.32,We are seeing cases going down.,78,,
826,0.97,3757.32,3760.256,And vaccines going up.,78,,
827,0.97,3760.256,3771.768,And which is a huge success for us here in King County.,78,,
828,0.97,3771.768,3772.335,To congratulate Seattle.,78,,
829,0.97,3772.335,3780.143,"The first major city to actually reach our 70%, complete their vaccine series of 16 and older.",78,,
830,0.97,3780.143,3787.049,So huge Callout to the city of Seattle and all of the work that all of you are doing.,78,,
831,0.97,3787.049,3794.257,"This slide in front of you is just kind of looking at some of our case rates here, as we look.",78,,
832,0.97,3794.257,3801.964,"And as you see, again, just improvements across all of our Metrics as we move in and look at more closely into the case rates.",78,,
833,0.97,3801.964,3811.674,"Over the last seven days, for public health Seattle King County, we have been reporting about 82 new cases daily.",78,,
834,0.97,3811.674,3813.309,Which is down about 16%.,78,,
835,0.97,3813.309,3814.31,Even from last week.,78,,
836,0.97,3814.31,3817.113,"Every week, we're seeing a decline of new cases that are dropping.",78,,
837,0.97,3817.113,3822.718,And this is really the lowest that we have seen since September of 2020.,78,,
838,0.97,3822.718,3825.021,"So just really, really great numbers.",78,,
839,0.97,3825.021,3826.923,"I mean, 82 is still too many.",78,,
840,0.97,3826.923,3831.327,But in comparison to where we were.,78,,
841,0.97,3831.327,3835.164,"It's just a huge, good point to be in with where we're at right now.",78,,
842,0.97,3835.164,3835.831,At this part of it.,78,,
843,0.97,3835.831,3843.105,"The other part that is good news in this is as you know, from having lived this experience in the pandemic.",78,,
844,0.97,3843.105,3853.149,"Our most vulnerable population really of 65 and older, were the ones who would be--see the most severe illness, would see hospitalization, would be our highest rates of death.",78,,
845,0.97,3853.149,3860.523,"And really, this is a loss we've seen in this population of 65 and older, since the beginning of the pandemic.",78,,
846,0.97,3860.523,3865.094,"Just incredibly great news for our hospitalizations, for our deaths.",78,,
847,0.97,3865.094,3868.364,And for the population of 65 and older.,78,,
848,0.97,3868.364,3874.537,"Again, we're seeing this--again, as the general, I always like to start begging and diving in a little lower.",78,,
849,0.97,3874.537,3878.374,But our incidents around all of our age groups are also decreasing.,78,,
850,0.97,3878.374,3883.913,"And across really all of our ethnic and racial groups, are also seeing decreases.",78,,
851,0.97,3883.913,3889.852,But we do have some pocket little of inequities here that I Dopt to call out.,78,,
852,0.97,3889.852,3894.557,That we need to spend our time as a public health agency.,78,,
853,0.97,3894.557,3900.096,"The important thing, as I go into this, about where we're seeing these cases.",78,,
854,0.97,3900.096,3902.698,You'll hear me say this throughout the presentation.,78,,
855,0.97,3902.698,3904.2,I can't say it enough.,78,,
856,0.97,3904.2,3904.767,Vaccines work.,78,,
857,0.97,3904.767,3906.769,And people have got to get Vaccinated.,78,,
858,0.97,3906.769,3910.006,And for us to really see this go away.,78,,
859,0.97,3910.006,3912.775,As in our communities.,78,,
860,0.97,3912.775,3920.716,"So what we're seeing, 97% of all of our cases, right now, are among Unvaccinated people.",78,,
861,0.97,3920.716,3924.52,Men 97% are really among Unvaccinated people.,78,,
862,0.97,3924.52,3928.791,So seeing highest rates now in South and Southeast King County.,78,,
863,0.97,3928.791,3932.328,Is where most of our new infections are occurring.,78,,
864,0.97,3932.328,3938.501,But the part that I really want to call out is where we're seeing our greatest I inequity.,78,,
865,0.97,3938.501,3948.844,And we are really trying to Hone in and do our innovation and our strategies to address is in our black and African American residents.,78,,
866,0.97,3948.844,3952.281,27% of our new cases fall within that racial and ethnic group.,78,,
867,0.97,3952.281,3963.426,"If you think about King County as a whole, and last census data, 70% is made up by black and African American folks.",78,,
868,0.97,3963.426,3971.367,But 27% fall within that new population.,78,,
869,0.97,3971.367,3972.735,It's really the biggest disparity gap.,78,,
870,0.97,3972.735,3979.842,What we're seeing now as populations are getting Vaccinations.,78,,
871,0.97,3979.842,3986.649,"As populations are having less incidents of cases, this is where our Disparitygap continues to grow.",78,,
872,0.97,3986.649,3987.917,We have work to do there.,78,,
873,0.97,3987.917,3992.355,And appreciate anything you can do to partner with us in that particular area.,78,,
874,0.97,3992.355,3998.294,The one thing I'll just say here that I think is important to also understand about our cases.,78,,
875,0.97,3998.294,4001.764,And I just want to put a little plug in here.,78,,
876,0.97,4001.764,4003.599,It's just been in the media so much.,78,,
877,0.97,4003.599,4005.868,You hear these things called Variants of concern.,78,,
878,0.97,4005.868,4013.576,And it's really where we're seeing these new Variants of Covid really starting to emerge a bit in our communities.,78,,
879,0.97,4013.576,4023.219,"And it is not uncommon for a Coronavirus, which is really how it survives in its environment, continues to evolve and adapt.",78,,
880,0.97,4023.219,4026.689,And so we're watching that very closely.,78,,
881,0.97,4026.689,4031.193,"Because right now, of all the Variants that are out there, our vaccines are very, very effective.",78,,
882,0.97,4031.193,4035.798,"It doesn't mean down the road, we may not need a booster at some point.",78,,
883,0.97,4035.798,4040.87,"But right now, we're showing 80% effective across all of Variants.",78,,
884,0.97,4040.87,4045.541,The variant that is getting a lot of attention now is coming out of India.,78,,
885,0.97,4045.541,4048.043,It's called the Delta variant.,78,,
886,0.97,4048.043,4050.746,"In the UK, starting to go backwards.",78,,
887,0.97,4050.746,4051.981,Starting to close environments down.,78,,
888,0.97,4051.981,4055.317,Over 60% of their new cases are of this particular variant.,78,,
889,0.97,4055.317,4062.158,"In the United States, only about 6% of our cases are made of this Delta variant.",78,,
890,0.97,4062.158,4064.16,"Here in King County, it's about 5%.",78,,
891,0.97,4064.16,4066.095,And that's pretty much the same across the state.,78,,
892,0.97,4066.095,4072.468,But it is really something worth keeping an eye on.,78,,
893,0.97,4072.468,4073.202,It's highly transmissible.,78,,
894,0.97,4073.202,4075.271,Far higher than other Areaiant.,78,,
895,0.97,4075.271,4077.339,It is a O--variant.,78,,
896,0.97,4077.339,4079.074,And we're keeping our eye on that.,78,,
897,0.97,4079.074,4084.48,The slide before you is about our vaccine.,78,,
898,0.97,4084.48,4086.182,Today is the 6-Month anniversary.,78,,
899,0.97,4086.182,4088.551,What that we had available in Washington state.,78,,
900,0.97,4088.551,4104.667,"And we have had great success and something to really celebrate, in six months time what we have been able to mobilize and able to do in really protecting our communities and people from this Covid virus and shutting down this pandemic.",78,,
901,0.97,4104.667,4106.836,"So you know, sometimes in percentages, numbers get lost.",78,,
902,0.97,4106.836,4108.404,I just want to call out.,78,,
903,0.97,4108.404,4113.676,Just because it's such a huge number.,78,,
904,0.97,4113.676,4118.481,"In King County, 1.5 million people have at least started their vaccine series.",78,,
905,0.97,4118.481,4122.585,1.5 million have at least started.,78,,
906,0.97,4122.585,4123.719,1.3 million are fully Vaccinated.,78,,
907,0.97,4123.719,4134.73,"It's just a huge success in six months that we have been able to accomplish, as we look at our populations of 12 and older eligible for the vaccine.",78,,
908,0.97,4134.73,4145.541,"In the city of Seattle, for 12 and older, we're seeing about 71, quickly approaching 72% of 12 and older, have completed their vaccine series.",78,,
909,0.97,4145.541,4149.545,And almost 80% have now received at least one dose.,78,,
910,0.97,4149.545,4151.213,So those numbers are increasing.,78,,
911,0.97,4151.213,4155.951,"And again, just to the success and partnership of many folks doing that.",78,,
912,0.97,4155.951,4159.955,And I'll call a few of those out in a moment.,78,,
913,0.97,4159.955,4167.863,"County wide, in comparison, we're about 68% of all residents 12 and older, who have completed their vaccine series.",78,,
914,0.97,4167.863,4171.634,And about 76.4% have received at least one dose of their sack seen.,78,,
915,0.97,4171.634,4180.843,"On the 16 and older, you know, we have a mask mandate here issue, at King County, issued by Dr. Jeff Duchin.",78,,
916,0.97,4180.843,4184.98,Until we hit our 70% fully Vaccinated.,78,,
917,0.97,4184.98,4187.583,We will hit this week for sure.,78,,
918,0.97,4187.583,4196.525,"We're looking at our numbers today, whether we will reach the completed vaccine of 70% in the county.",78,,
919,0.97,4196.525,4204.833,"So just remember, completed vaccine means that you finished the series, fully completed vaccine.",78,,
920,0.97,4204.833,4214.777,"Fully Vaccinated, means it's two weeks post that last vaccine, where your antibodies have had time to develop and your immunities are established.",78,,
921,0.97,4214.777,4219.281,70% is when the local mask mandate will be lifted.,78,,
922,0.97,4219.281,4220.649,So how have we done this?,78,,
923,0.97,4220.649,4227.723,"Other than dedication, commitment and good work of folks and good education and willingness of the Seattle people and King County folks.",78,,
924,0.97,4227.723,4236.098,"But we have launched in this last six months, these high- volume vaccine sites in all regions of the county.",78,,
925,0.97,4236.098,4243.339,"And we've worked closely with partners, unusual partners in the sense of coming together with government.",78,,
926,0.97,4243.339,4247.743,"These Public-Private partnerships, in order to get this accomplished.",78,,
927,0.97,4247.743,4249.545,"Microsoft, Kaiser permanenty, University of Washington.",78,,
928,0.97,4249.545,4254.45,Seattle fire has just done a tremendous job in stepping in and helping us out.,78,,
929,0.97,4254.45,4262.358,"Swedish hospital have really helped with these High-Capacity sites, in order to get people Vaccinated in the masses.",78,,
930,0.97,4262.358,4265.461,We know that there are barriers for some.,78,,
931,0.97,4265.461,4271.767,We've tried to remove those barriers go N getting transportation provided for folks.,78,,
932,0.97,4271.767,4278.34,We've provided appointments in the evenings.,78,,
933,0.97,4278.34,4278.607,Weekends.,78,,
934,0.97,4278.607,4280.342,Walkup clinics.,78,,
935,0.97,4280.342,4280.743,No appointments.,78,,
936,0.97,4280.743,4281.543,On site interpretation.,78,,
937,0.97,4281.543,4282.578,Access for people with disability.,78,,
938,0.97,4282.578,4287.182,Any barrier that we heard and was identified or thought in advance.,78,,
939,0.97,4287.182,4291.954,We removed those barriers in order to get people Vaccinated.,78,,
940,0.97,4291.954,4297.026,"Also, we've mobilized the fire departments and mobile teams to go where people gather.",78,,
941,0.97,4297.026,4297.393,"Parks, beaches.",78,,
942,0.97,4297.393,4299.995,"High schools, places of employment.",78,,
943,0.97,4299.995,4304.566,But really to take our vaccines to where people are already at.,78,,
944,0.97,4304.566,4308.504,For people who couldn't get to one of those High-Vaccine sites.,78,,
945,0.97,4308.504,4322.651,"In some of our innovative approaches, looking at people who were homebound, who for one reason or another couldn't leave homes or people in homeless shelters or other homeless settings.",78,,
946,0.97,4322.651,4334.83,"We took mobile vaccine sites to those individual to really reach them to make sure they, too, were able to get fully Vaccinated and protected from this virus.",78,,
947,0.97,4334.83,4336.432,Lots of different approaches.,78,,
948,0.97,4336.432,4337.733,Lots of Modalities.,78,,
949,0.97,4337.733,4338.467,One size doesn't fit all.,78,,
950,0.97,4338.467,4348.944,"Ask because of that, I think we're seeing the success success, leading the country, as the city of Seattle and as the county, King County, and our ways.",78,,
951,0.97,4348.944,4357.052,"Again, as I did with our case rates, we are still see something goals here that we have not reached.",78,,
952,0.97,4357.052,4360.122,Our goals have been led with equity.,78,,
953,0.97,4360.122,4364.827,And looking at 70% against all age groups.,78,,
954,0.97,4364.827,4366.562,Against all race and Ethnicity groups.,78,,
955,0.97,4366.562,4372.901,Because we do not want to create a tale of two cities as you oftentimes hear in the media.,78,,
956,0.97,4372.901,4376.238,But really to reach each population by that 70% or more.,78,,
957,0.97,4376.238,4384.68,"So in our--where we've seen great success, of hitting that 70% or greater.",78,,
958,0.97,4384.68,4389.485,"Is 74% among our Mirn Indian, Alaska natives.",78,,
959,0.97,4389.485,4392.454,Have completed the series.,78,,
960,0.97,4392.454,4393.489,70% of Asian Americans.,78,,
961,0.97,4393.489,4395.891,And almost 70%.,78,,
962,0.97,4395.891,4398.794,69% of our native Hawaiian Pacific Islanders.,78,,
963,0.97,4398.794,4399.828,This is for 12 and older.,78,,
964,0.97,4399.828,4409.204,Where we're seeing the big gaps are still only about 48% of our black African American populations have completed their vaccine series.,78,,
965,0.97,4409.204,4414.51,And about 50% of our Hispanic and Latin X population 12 and older.,78,,
966,0.97,4414.51,4417.379,As we are moving into our next phase of vaccines.,78,,
967,0.97,4417.379,4423.085,"Of course, we want to continue to--Ideally, we'd love 100% Vaccinated.",78,,
968,0.97,4423.085,4433.662,But our target and stress efforts will be really around these two populations of our black African American populations and our Hispanic and Latin X population.,78,,
969,0.97,4433.662,4440.702,Which I think is an important part of the conversation as you guys look at the work you're doing here today.,78,,
970,0.97,4440.702,4448.544,"So I do want to acknowledge that huge achievements, work that still needs to be done in this area.",78,,
971,0.97,4448.544,4453.282,But I don't want to not Saleebrate where we have been and where we're at.,78,,
972,0.97,4453.282,4456.351,"But still, a call to action for where we need to go.",78,,
973,0.97,4456.351,4458.153,Under vaccine access.,78,,
974,0.97,4458.153,4467.129,"As far as access and availability for grocery employees, grocery workers and other critical infrastructure workers.",78,,
975,0.97,4467.129,4468.43,Vaccine became available.,78,,
976,0.97,4468.43,4476.638,Marks as as a time line as a reminder became available for vaccines on March 17th.,78,,
977,0.97,4476.638,4484.78,"The next important date was around April 15th, is when all Washington residents, people who live here, reside here.",78,,
978,0.97,4484.78,4487.483,16 or older became eligible for vaccines.,78,,
979,0.97,4487.483,4492.321,"And may 12th, our 12 to 15-Year- old became eligible for the Pfizer vaccine.",78,,
980,0.97,4492.321,4501.763,These are important critical dates that we're--we have opened top different populations.,78,,
981,0.97,4501.763,4511.807,For congratulations about when vaccine is available and where we have reached it.,78,,
982,0.97,4511.807,4517.88,"Just a Callout UFCW, local 21.",78,,
983,0.97,4517.88,4519.715,Washington food industry.,78,,
984,0.97,4519.715,4529.024,"Really helped support and coordinate access for grocery workers, in order to approve these numbers in this population getting a vaccine series.",78,,
985,0.97,4529.024,4533.729,Couldn't do it without their help and the help of many others.,78,,
986,0.97,4533.729,4537.533,So last slide of what's next?,78,,
987,0.97,4537.533,4541.603,What did we expect next?,78,,
988,0.97,4541.603,4542.905,For congratulations here.,78,,
989,0.97,4542.905,4556.952,"As you heard me say, our continued focus on vaccinating residents who aren't Vaccinated, there will be a special emphasis and focus on our Bipock communities.",78,,
990,0.97,4556.952,4558.02,And the community gaps.,78,,
991,0.97,4558.02,4570.165,"It's important that we do that lift here as government, as partners, as people in our community.",78,,
992,0.97,4570.165,4575.003,It's it's important to reach our equity goals in this response.,78,,
993,0.97,4575.003,4581.243,"From the governor, as you know, June 30th is what is stated as the opening date.",78,,
994,0.97,4581.243,4585.18,"Which means that restrictions, most restrictions will get removed after June 30th.",78,,
995,0.97,4585.18,4601.396,"And what the Potion piece that is driver behind that June 30th, is statewide, when 70% of statewide residents, or people who live within the state, have completed their initial vaccine.",78,,
996,0.97,4601.396,4602.864,70% of initial vaccine.,78,,
997,0.97,4602.864,4603.165,Statewide.,78,,
998,0.97,4603.165,4605.4,That's what gets us to our reopening.,78,,
999,0.97,4605.4,4613.609,"It wasn't a call this morning, where the State Department of health reported out that they actually think that they're going to hit that date before June 30th.",78,,
1000,0.97,4613.609,4620.215,"And in the governor's language, that if they do, they will be making that announcement and reopening before June 30th.",78,,
1001,0.97,4620.215,4624.286,So I do think that is a real date.,78,,
1002,0.97,4624.286,4628.323,And a real reopening for the state of Washington.,78,,
1003,0.97,4628.323,4657.719,"The one thing I will just say about that on June 30th date is you heard the governor's office, the mask requirements will stay in effect as they are for Lni.",78,,
1004,0.97,4657.719,4658.52,Basically health care environments.,78,,
1005,0.97,4658.52,4660.722,Congregrant settings.,78,,
1006,0.97,4660.722,4664.659,Look at where people live together.,78,,
1007,0.97,4664.659,4666.928,And Healthcare environments like long-term care facilities.,78,,
1008,0.97,4666.928,4673.568,"And of course, Unvaccinated people will still be required to wear masks.",78,,
1009,0.97,4673.568,4680.108,The other requirement that will remain is that these for for MEGA large events.,78,,
1010,0.97,4680.108,4681.243,"10,000 and more.",78,,
1011,0.97,4681.243,4681.91,In these events.,78,,
1012,0.97,4681.91,4686.415,"And spaces for indoors, will be required to be restricted for 75% capacity.",78,,
1013,0.97,4686.415,4689.351,Unless they do some kind of vaccine verification.,78,,
1014,0.97,4689.351,4695.19,"And what they, that that way, they can go to 100% capacity.",78,,
1015,0.97,4695.19,4700.896,"Next point here is about the King County mask direct identify Ive, that I've spoken about.",78,,
1016,0.97,4700.896,4702.597,Issued by our own health officer.,78,,
1017,0.97,4702.597,4706.601,And that's when we reach our 70% of completed vaccines.,78,,
1018,0.97,4706.601,4707.903,And fully Vaccinated.,78,,
1019,0.97,4707.903,4712.207,"So again, I think we will hit our completed vaccines this week.",78,,
1020,0.97,4712.207,4714.71,Today or tomorrow.,78,,
1021,0.97,4714.71,4717.512,"And then it's two weeks, following.",78,,
1022,0.97,4717.512,4723.118,"Before that directive would be lifted, which would be the end of June, as well.",78,,
1023,0.97,4723.118,4729.491,So that's a couple of important things about where we're at in our next phases.,78,,
1024,0.97,4729.491,4735.43,"The last bullet there is really about right now, 12 and under are not eligible for vaccines.",78,,
1025,0.97,4735.43,4738.3,There's a lot of work on this right now.,78,,
1026,0.97,4738.3,4741.737,By a number of Federal partners and agencies.,78,,
1027,0.97,4741.737,4748.243,"And--but when that does, we're trying to get our systems in place and planning for that.",78,,
1028,0.97,4748.243,4758.687,We know from other childhood vaccines that are best trusted places for people to get that information and get Vaccinated are through their own Healthcare providers.,78,,
1029,0.97,4758.687,4761.79,We'll be working closely with Pediatricians.,78,,
1030,0.97,4761.79,4767.462,To get those message messages out to families of children.,78,,
1031,0.97,4767.462,4784.079,"Also, to incorporate Covid vaccine in our children's well checks as part of a routine day way of doing work.",78,,
1032,0.97,4784.079,4786.081,Continuing multiple access.,78,,
1033,0.97,4786.081,4791.753,Going to remove any barriers that are there for them.,78,,
1034,0.97,4791.753,4795.29,See if there is anything I can answer.,79,,
1035,0.97,4795.29,4805.834,Or get answers to and get them back to you in our reopening where we're at with cases.,79,,
1036,0.97,4805.834,4809.104,But all pretty much good news coming from your public health Department.,79,,
1037,0.97,4809.104,4810.305,That's great.,80,,
1038,0.97,4810.305,4811.139,Thank you so much.,80,,
1039,0.97,4811.139,4814.776,And I think your comment earlier summarized well.,80,,
1040,0.97,4814.776,4817.579,We have reason to be cautiously optimistic.,80,,
1041,0.97,4817.579,4820.215,But also know there are certain threats out there.,80,,
1042,0.97,4820.215,4822.617,And certain disparities that need to be addressed.,80,,
1043,0.97,4822.617,4829.591,"Before we take questions, I just want to thank everybody who is part of this panel.",80,,
1044,0.97,4829.591,4831.726,Dennis Worsham.,80,,
1045,0.97,4831.726,4834.829,"Also thank you very much, Tammy, Samuel, Holly and mark.",80,,
1046,0.97,4834.829,4836.765,And we do have some time for questions.,80,,
1047,0.97,4836.765,4839.835,"Folks we, we did start this panel a little early.",80,,
1048,0.97,4839.835,4842.671,But we have caught up on a little bit of time.,80,,
1049,0.97,4842.671,4852.781,So we have about eight to 10 minutes for questions here and would love to open the floor to see if anybody has any questions.,80,,
1050,0.97,4852.781,4855.383,Of course I have questions.,80,,
1051,0.97,4855.383,4857.018,Because it's public health.,80,,
1052,0.97,4857.018,4857.919,Let me jump in.,80,,
1053,0.97,4857.919,4872.567,"Direct Oor, I'm wondering, on the disparity gap data you shared, I didn't see a slide that corresponded with that.",80,,
1054,0.97,4872.567,4874.336,I saw they.,80,,
1055,0.97,4874.336,4876.605,To where we were past September.,81,,
1056,0.97,4876.605,4877.272,That was Knighting.,81,,
1057,0.97,4877.272,4884.346,But there were comments that you made in between that slide and the next slide about the disparity data.,81,,
1058,0.97,4884.346,4886.648,Could you share that with us?,81,,
1059,0.97,4886.648,4896.191,If you have about how the communities more specifically are fairing relative to vaccination rates.,81,,
1060,0.97,4896.191,4896.758,Yes.,82,,
1061,0.97,4896.758,4899.895,I can definitely get you some slide decks for that.,82,,
1062,0.97,4899.895,4900.428,Thank you.,83,,
1063,0.97,4900.428,4902.631,Just send those directly to you?,84,,
1064,0.97,4902.631,4902.898,Yeah.,85,,
1065,0.97,4902.898,4911.506,And we'll share them with the Fulg Council.,85,,
1066,0.97,4911.506,4912.874,Related to the Variants.,85,,
1067,0.97,4912.874,4918.113,"And I think your note of caution was, we are keeping our eye on this.",85,,
1068,0.97,4918.113,4929.524,"And I'm wondering, you know, relative to that, second spike that we saw, we knew what the end of September, early October, that we were anticipating a rise in rates.",85,,
1069,0.97,4929.524,4931.793,In Mid-November.,85,,
1070,0.97,4931.793,4933.828,And we definitely saw that.,85,,
1071,0.97,4933.828,4947.842,Is there any projections on when we would see a possible variant if it were localized here in King county or Seattle?,85,,
1072,0.97,4947.842,4948.109,Yeah.,86,,
1073,0.97,4948.109,4948.343,Great.,86,,
1074,0.97,4948.343,4952.514,Great question.,86,,
1075,0.97,4952.514,4968.063,"A little context setting, over 60% of our cases in King County are a variant of one kind or another.",87,,
1076,0.97,4968.063,4968.53,Over 80% already.,87,,
1077,0.97,4968.53,4971.299,Just the natural essence of Coronavirus is it continues to survive.,87,,
1078,0.97,4971.299,4979.441,Because it wants to survive.,87,,
1079,0.97,4979.441,4984.312,There are those who reach out for variant of concern.,88,,
1080,0.97,4984.312,4986.381,And there's probably a Hanltdful.,88,,
1081,0.97,4986.381,4991.786,We're looking about the trends of where they are.,88,,
1082,0.97,4991.786,4998.36,We're seeing where they are and how the vaccines really are effective around them.,88,,
1083,0.97,4998.36,5005.467,"Good news is, that it is still vaccines are very effective around it.",88,,
1084,0.97,5005.467,5016.044,"Bad news is, they are getting, the Variants of concern, to get a little smarter in how they become transmissible.",88,,
1085,0.97,5016.044,5016.644,They're more transmissible.,88,,
1086,0.97,5016.644,5018.513,They are getting more efficient on how they do that.,88,,
1087,0.97,5018.513,5024.085,It's really why it's so important for our vaccines to continue to do it.,88,,
1088,0.97,5024.085,5028.757,"If we can interrupt Natransmission, it stops the evolution of these VAR Nant Iants.",88,,
1089,0.97,5028.757,5033.895,Auto it's part of the public health message of concern.,88,,
1090,0.97,5033.895,5038.7,"If we get people to wear a mask, if they're not Vaccinated yet.",88,,
1091,0.97,5038.7,5046.241,"If we can improve indoor air quality, that's both on ventilation and filtration.",88,,
1092,0.97,5046.241,5047.709,And we get people Vaccinated.,88,,
1093,0.97,5047.709,5051.713,Those three things are still good protective factors against these Variants.,88,,
1094,0.97,5051.713,5054.015,And we've got to continue to hammer that message out.,88,,
1095,0.97,5054.015,5055.65,It's not over yet.,88,,
1096,0.97,5055.65,5056.484,We're seeing great success.,88,,
1097,0.97,5056.484,5059.521,But there is some caution of where we're at.,88,,
1098,0.97,5059.521,5063.291,If we don't shut this virus down completely.,88,,
1099,0.97,5063.291,5072.801,There are some opportunities probably down the road that will have to have any some kind of booster or something in order to be able to respond with these vaccines.,88,,
1100,0.97,5072.801,5077.272,In this magic crystal ball that we're trying to navigate this whole pandemic.,88,,
1101,0.97,5077.272,5080.742,It's just a bit of a science and bit of art.,88,,
1102,0.97,5080.742,5086.981,Is how do you wind down as numbers go down.,88,,
1103,0.97,5086.981,5089.584,That you increase again ready to do that.,88,,
1104,0.97,5089.584,5090.852,We have work.,88,,
1105,0.97,5090.852,5091.786,We are watching this.,88,,
1106,0.97,5091.786,5095.79,We anticipate with outdoor events happening more in the summertime.,88,,
1107,0.97,5095.79,5098.893,And people have their doors and windows open.,88,,
1108,0.97,5098.893,5105.934,"That we'll continue to see this trend, hopefully throughout the summer.",88,,
1109,0.97,5105.934,5111.406,"But we're watching closely as they move back into the indoor areas, spike in the fall.",88,,
1110,0.97,5111.406,5112.607,Some predict that we will.,88,,
1111,0.97,5112.607,5117.412,But too early to know.,88,,
1112,0.97,5117.412,5120.915,And and we're keeping our eyes close on it.,88,,
1113,0.97,5120.915,5121.316,Thank you.,89,,
1114,0.97,5121.316,5123.218,I'm not seeing any additional hands.,89,,
1115,0.97,5123.218,5125.553,I'm just going to ask two more questions.,89,,
1116,0.97,5125.553,5133.928,And sounds like some of the modifications that the industry has made will also be helpful in addressing those Variants that you noted earlier.,89,,
1117,0.97,5133.928,5136.631,So appreciate that.,89,,
1118,0.97,5136.631,5139.634,So two questions.,89,,
1119,0.97,5139.634,5150.278,"So regarding folks who are not wearing masks inside the stores here, in Seattle, you know, I went for a run the other day.",89,,
1120,0.97,5150.278,5153.047,"And it was so warm, that I stepped inside a store.",89,,
1121,0.97,5153.047,5156.918,And I had them do some cooling down to get some AC.,89,,
1122,0.97,5156.918,5162.624,And I was reminded by the clerk that there was a master climate.,89,,
1123,0.97,5162.624,5165.46,And I forgot.,89,,
1124,0.97,5165.46,5165.827,I was running.,89,,
1125,0.97,5165.827,5171.065,Put my mouth in my shirt to make sure I thank them for the reminder to be wearing a mask.,89,,
1126,0.97,5171.065,5173.268,And quickly stepped back outside.,89,,
1127,0.97,5173.268,5182.043,"That was in Iowa, where Unfortunately, they don't have as great of a public health Department or a governor who has been leading on this effort, completely the opposite there.",89,,
1128,0.97,5182.043,5190.351,"But it was a great reminder from the clerk there, at the store that it was important to remind folks that their mask requirement was still in effect.",89,,
1129,0.97,5190.351,5193.988,"So if somebody does come in the store, Holly, did I misunderstand you?",89,,
1130,0.97,5193.988,5204.065,"If they're not wearing a mask, is that something Naan employee is ask--that an employee is asked them to remind them there is a requirement?",89,,
1131,0.97,5204.065,5205.567,You mentioned there is no card check.,89,,
1132,0.97,5205.567,5209.304,But is that something the employees are asked to do at this point?,89,,
1133,0.97,5209.304,5215.243,It really depends on the retailer and how they are managing the enforcement of the policy.,90,,
1134,0.97,5215.243,5216.177,We have signs up.,90,,
1135,0.97,5216.177,5222.717,There are some smaller retailers that are actually still blocking folks.,90,,
1136,0.97,5222.717,5228.756,"In fact, I Sua retailer that got creative.",90,,
1137,0.97,5228.756,5229.29,"Said, you're Vaccinated.",90,,
1138,0.97,5229.29,5229.691,Congratulations.,90,,
1139,0.97,5229.691,5232.927,You still have to wear a mask in our store.,90,,
1140,0.97,5232.927,5234.529,So it depends on the retailer.,90,,
1141,0.97,5234.529,5237.365,"But Obviously, there are still confrontations that occur.",90,,
1142,0.97,5237.365,5243.271,And we're trying to be thoughtful about what we can ask our employees to do in enforcing public health.,90,,
1143,0.97,5243.271,5253.548,"And then again, what is also reasonable ask our employees to do in a scenario, where there are a lot of people who are Vaccinated, Thankfully.",90,,
1144,0.97,5253.548,5257.852,"Who do have, under CDC guidance, the able to come in without a mask on.",90,,
1145,0.97,5257.852,5262.323,I'm actually getting questions now from folks who are seeing employees without a mask.,90,,
1146,0.97,5262.323,5265.159,Seeing customers without a mask.,90,,
1147,0.97,5265.159,5268.463,"And under the CDC guidance, that's allowed.",90,,
1148,0.97,5268.463,5272.166,And so we are struggling a little bit with finding that balance.,90,,
1149,0.97,5272.166,5275.837,Just as we struggled when we got into this.,90,,
1150,0.97,5275.837,5276.471,We're Strug lick to come out.,90,,
1151,0.97,5276.471,5277.605,That's going to be the challenge.,90,,
1152,0.97,5277.605,5281.576,And I think it will continue to be as we continue to work our way through the pandemic.,90,,
1153,0.97,5281.576,5303.865,"And I just wanted to ask mark and also Samuel, are there any other items that you'd like to lift up, outside of the hazard pay discussion that you are hoping to put on a radar as we continue to work with the public health data on current Dispairity issues that we've seen.",91,,
1154,0.97,5303.865,5312.173,"And also, on the ongoing desire to make sure that we're monitoring these Variants.",91,,
1155,0.97,5312.173,5322.517,Or that you'd like,91,,
1156,0.97,5325.787,5336.13,I think those are foremost on our members minds--I think there is a lot of uncertainty.,92,,
1157,0.97,5336.13,5362.757,"Not a lot, but there is remaining uncertainty about--in the household and what is really the right thing to do--I think what our members probably want is--that is very cautious, right?",92,,
1158,0.97,5362.757,5374.969,"Better to over correct with caution than to under correct and find that we created another surge, right?",92,,
1159,0.97,5374.969,5389.384,But I think that the presentations--we appreciate it.,92,,
1160,0.97,5389.384,5402.396,"Great, I look forward to working with all of you especially as we look at disparity cap data that Dennis described, so I know--go ahead I am so sorry --",93,,
1161,0.97,5402.396,5446.307,"It is Okay, I just wanted to quickly add something, I feel that a lot of things you have done so far as--a lot of us really appreciate--we all realize that we are not going to get the hazard pay forever but just--in order for you to go through the process is quite the domino effect for not just us but a lot of people across the country, I want to thank you again and let you know how--we do not get this level of appreciation from the Kroger executives, they just brag about how much money they make and put it in our face.",94,,
1162,0.97,5446.307,5470.998,-- on my behalf I am not going to complain because we were in a situation where we were considered essential so we were forced to go out I am seeing a lot of people struggling in society right now--as far as I am concerned for all of the things to get done so far it has helped out a lot with the hazard pay and implementing ways for a lot of us to get our Vaccinations.,94,,
1163,0.97,5470.998,5494.989,"I have gotten mine, I am completely Vaccinated I still choose to wear a mask because until I see signs that it is totally eradicated I am going to continue to do what I feel is safe for me and my family so thank you for all that you have done and all the data that you have presented --",94,,
1164,0.97,5494.989,5652.246,"That is really appreciated and you are absolutely where the and we appreciate your time and all you do in your presentation today and I think that is a good Segue, I do not see any other tiles coming up so I would be interested in working with--for a joint effort to address some of the disparity gap data that we know is currently Plaguing King County as well as other areas across our country and I think first acknowledging that disparity is important appreciate the slides that will be forthcoming having worked with--very diverse membership and assume that many of the disparity and gap data that we are seeing on the county level could potentially be reflected among the family members if not the actual Associates within the grocery store so I think it is important for us to find a place as mark and Samuel will were describing--to make sure that you are making vaccines really accessible not just offering but trying to make sure that they are accessible and I would love to work with all of you on how we close those disparity gaps especially with--and I know that that will have a Multiplier effect a positive effect for both our family members and community members that will--I am going to tee up for our discussion the possibility of Revisiting again the grocery worker hazard pay I think based on the information we were seeing from cautious optimism we have received it would make sense for us to have legislation ready for us to consider at the July 9 meeting to amend the grocery worker hazard pay, I think this would be an opportunity for us to strike the hazard pay requirement but to make sure that we are keeping on the books record keeping and enforcement that was part of the original legislation as well I think that would help us out with continuing to follow through on the initial intent of making sure we Revisit this legislation within four months to--and the good Statistics we have seen on overall Vaccinations--obviously we would be working with--to track some of the additional trends that are concerning before that date and before any final passage that would be my suggestion again bringing forth legislation to make that amendment on July 9 any comments or questions?",95,,
1165,0.97,5652.246,5734.695,I am not seeing any we went slightly over our time for today but I really do appreciate everybody's participation in this discussion and that would allow for us to Revisit this conversation Holly Tammy mark Sam if there is any additional comments you would like to add for our July 9 meeting we would definitely reach back out to you to make sure that we reflect your comments back in that legislation as well and have an opportunity of course to do public testimony but I really do appreciate the collaborative way in which folks come to address the issue we know that it is in the public's health best interest to make sure we are working together--so I am very impressed by the information shared today and I also want to underscore the concern I think that the interim director has done--both within public health and the private sector so let's do more of these conversations together in the future about how we can continue to work together and I think the first step will be to Revisit that legislation on July 9 .--thanks for your participation and we will have more discussion--so let's move on to item number 2 we have our friends at the office of housing with us.,95,,
1166,0.97,5734.695,5750.511,"Agenda item number 2, council bill 120101.",96,,
1167,0.97,5750.511,5788.482,-- thank you for your flexibility in coming to do the presentation at today's meeting instead of two weeks ago and thanks for the presentation that you shared with us I am going to save some of my comments until we--and with the committee's generous consideration I would love to have the briefing possible--we are about 5 minutes over but we are going to endeavor to try to get through this in the next 25 minutes thank you so much.,97,,
1168,0.97,5788.482,5798.692,Thank you very much and thank you for the opportunity to present today.,98,,
1169,0.97,5798.692,5879.34,I am stalling a little bit as Kelly presents--prepares to present . as she is doing that I can start talking which is to say that today we are doing two main things first as you mentioned we are heading toward a conversation about legislation that legislation is related to our administer native and financial plan and housing funding policies and before we get jumped into a conversation about the every two-year review of the policies we will start with an overview of our annual investment that were made in 2020 and the purposes of that Recap is one to show space--as it relates to affordable housing but also because the resources that were invested there and show how our policies get used through our investments and mostly what you will see is that we remain on track or if not exceeding our goals under the Seattle housing levy and that helps--housing funding policies.,98,,
1170,0.97,5879.34,5891.886,So again this presentation we are going to start with an overview of our investment that were made in 2020 where those are included as part of the levy annual report which you can find also on our Website.,98,,
1171,0.97,5891.886,5914.475,Other reports we produce include reports for the multifamily tax exemption program mandatory affordable housing program and those can also be found on our Website and Kelly is going to talk a little bit about the upcoming legislation and to the levy administrative and financial housing funding policies.,98,,
1172,0.97,5914.475,5945.539,"So we are going to jump right in here but I do want to say by way of acknowledgment that when I talk about our housing investments, I do speak with some sense of pride because I am really proud of what we have been able to accomplish but I really do not want that pride to be Conflated at all with a sense that we have done enough or that we are done in what we are doing.",98,,
1173,0.97,5945.539,5968.662,"We know we are still in the midst of a homelessness crisis we still have an affordable housing crisis where many families and individuals are struggling to afford housing we know that the legacy of racial discrimination and segregation in housing versus so our work is nowhere near done, but I think that through these investments we showed that we know what to do and what we are doing is successful so long as we are able to do more.",98,,
1174,0.97,5968.662,5997.358,So here starting this off with a nice pie chart jumping in you will see that in 2020 we made roughly $123 million of $125 million of capital investments in affordable housing and the vast majority of those resources 92% went to support rental housing.,98,,
1175,0.97,5997.358,6064.958,"And you see that breakdown, we will talk about all of our program investments today with a focus mostly on rental housing because it makes up such a significant part of our investments so just giving a sense here we invested $115.9 Úmillion in rental housing, $56.7 million of that funding came from our Seattle housing money that remains the backbone of our ability to make investments in affordable housing $52.3 million came from the mandatory housing Affordability program payments so Mha payments helped to support investments this year $2.5 million came from incentive zoning payments and $4.5 million came from Federal resources I know you all have been talking a lot about Federal resources lately we need those to help make sure we are making a meaningful impact in our ability to address affordable housing issues and in this case it still represented a very small amount of resources we invested.",98,,
1176,0.97,6064.958,6165.959,"Another thing to say about our capital investments is that usually when we show you this light is we show you another pie which is how our investments in dollars leveraged additional resources and this time I do not have a pie chart for it but if her every dollar we invested we were able to--primarily in this case tax credit equity and debt and the thing about 2.5 as a leverage ratio is that is consistent with the underpinning and modeling of our housing levy so we remain on track but it is less than what we have talked to you all about before--for every 1 dollar and I do want to put a point on this year--and in order to do that to scale what housing we produced we have to be comfortable with the idea that we might be a larger percentage of the total development costs in each building I think it is still worth it to invest in that passion and I also believe that over time as we go more all in, we will actually encourage other Funders to come and grow resources as well and they will be with us so an example is we went pretty heavily in as part of this Psh pilot and you will see the Legislature just passed a historic unprecedented investment in affordable housing and--I see that Councilmember Lewis has a question.",98,,
1177,0.97,6165.959,6173.867,You are better at monitoring the chat then I am.,99,,
1178,0.97,6173.867,6175.269,Councilmember Lewis did you have a question?,99,,
1179,0.97,6175.269,6192.986,"Yes, I just wanted to ask, I see that the Mha takes a big part of the pie chart and I know you mentioned the number earlier, I was wondering if you could remind us the dollar amount of the Mha contribution.",100,,
1180,0.97,6192.986,6202.563,It was $52.3 million came from payments from the Mha program.,101,,
1181,0.97,6202.563,6212.873,Do we anticipate that to be a representative number or high or low?,102,,
1182,0.97,6212.873,6237.431,"It is a good question and I would probably want to get back to you about our projections around that amount, it is higher than it has been in the last few years, we will see what happens, a lot is dependent on what is happening in the development cycle over time, but I can follow up with some information about where that might fall relative to other fund sources and what our projections are.",103,,
1183,0.97,6237.431,6258.518,"The projects that have the Mha money now, when did those projects vest for example, I imagine they probably would have been Pre-Covid-19 instruction so this is sort of a hangover from buildings that got their master use permit in 2017 or something?",104,,
1184,0.97,6258.518,6291.885,"Exactly, you are explaining that this is the point at which we are expecting payments and then expecting--our Mha report lays all of this out in relation to timing and projection so that might be a topic of conversation for another day when we talk about Mha or I would be happy to follow up to make sure that I got it correctly.",105,,
1185,0.97,6291.885,6300.193,"I appreciate it, it is good to see that this program is producing some real resource for the office of housing.",106,,
1186,0.97,6300.193,6310.971,"In terms of the Mha dollars represented here, these are all payments, not on-site development is that right?",107,,
1187,0.97,6310.971,6311.571,That is correct.,108,,
1188,0.97,6311.571,6327.554,Does the office of housing capture the value of on-site development and if so what is the value of that on-site construction of affordable housing?,109,,
1189,0.97,6327.554,6363.757,"Really good question, so as you have suggested in your question, a developer has an opportunity to choose one of two ways to participant--they can make an on-site performance where they set aside a percentage depending on the zone of the units for at least 70 years and that becomes regulated with our office or they can make a payment based on a percentage and a square foot calculation to our office.",110,,
1190,0.97,6363.757,6402.796,"I do not have the numbers offhand but we have seen both developers choose to pay or perform an hour annual report outlines that balance, I think Anecdotally it is fair to say we have seen far more payment choices than we have seen performance, but there are two things to note, one of which is that for the purposes of the model underlying Mha, we anticipated that projects downtown and South Lake Union would almost exclusively pay, and that is in fact what is happening and a lot of those payments have come first.",110,,
1191,0.97,6402.796,6436.897,"We are also seeing some trends like in very small scale buildings, Townhome developments for example we are seeing more payment almost exclusively rather than performance, and in the mid tier, Midsize or larger apartment buildings we are seeing a mix have some payment and performance I cannot conjure up the numbers off the top of my head but they are included in our annual report.",110,,
1192,0.97,6436.897,6450.71,I am not seeing any additional questions thank you both for those questions so I am going to ask that folks hold their questions until the end of the presentation just so that we can get through the rest of the slides.,111,,
1193,0.97,6450.71,6451.545,Thank you.,112,,
1194,0.97,6451.545,6498.458,"So this is very brief but most of what this slide demonstrates is that we often talk about when we invest and what happens 2 to 4 years later after our investment is that apartment buildings become homes, the homes actually open and they are ready for people to move in, and what this chart is showing you, on the left you have annual investments and on the right you see a picture of units opening as active rental apartments and essentially when we invest and when we have spikes of investment, that investment results in production.",112,,
1195,0.97,6498.458,6503.897,So the work that we are doing on the investment side does produce the intended result.,112,,
1196,0.97,6503.897,6506.199,Next light please.,112,,
1197,0.97,6517.844,6531.224,In 2020 I was really proud to say that we did something different we have one funding cycle last year we did three funding cycles really to reflect different policy priorities of the office and of the city.,112,,
1198,0.97,6531.224,6548.241,"First of all we added a spring funding round and the purpose there was we have projects that were really ready,--or they were ready to get under construction but for our financing.",112,,
1199,0.97,6548.241,6566.66,"So we made funding available in the spring to help facilitate mortar rapid more rapid delivery of--in some cases, in two of the projects, those buildings are under construction now so we really see the the impact of those investments.",112,,
1200,0.97,6566.66,6629.889,"In the summer we were really in the midst of the pandemic, and because of the public health crisis and because we know that people who are experiencing homelessness are really vulnerable to experiencing the public health crisis and because we know that--is the solution to homelessness we sought to double a single year's production of--by accelerating resources from our Seattle housing levy to invest nearly $60 million and produce--we also sought to do a couple of other things with the pilot and that is to see--we can also find ways to be Cost- efficient and find ways to reduce the Timeline of delivery and we are seeing some really good results with that pilot.",112,,
1201,0.97,6629.889,6688.081,"In the fall we went ahead with our typically timed annual funding round, but in this case we really sought to emphasize achieving racial equity outcomes even more than in a typical--and we did so in part by Partnering with--we did so by thinking about best practices in supporting folks of color living in affordable housing so examples here where we funded Mount Zion to create senior housing--we created equity alliance of Washington--and we supported the Rehab of Ywca's landmark project on fifth and Seneca to convert single room document units to full functioning studios to provide more dignity and health and safety for its residents.",112,,
1202,0.97,6688.081,6692.652,Next slide.,112,,
1203,0.97,6692.652,6729.589,"So at a glance that is the summary of the investment, the breakdown of the investments that we have made and through that we will see that we supported the creation of 1286 new rental units I will talk more about those homeownership investments later, but what you do see here is a mix of projects so we are not just working with one or two housing agencies, we are working with many Community-Based partners to achieve this affordable housing and I will talk more about the neighborhoods as you see them reflected across the state.",112,,
1204,0.97,6729.589,6731.791,Next slide.,112,,
1205,0.97,6731.791,6821.414,"So really excited that a key piece of the work that we do in the office of housing when we invest our housing capital is to support homeownership and I really have to pause here to acknowledge that we hear more and more from community members particularly from communities of color that homeownership investment is one of the things that we are able to do to help close the racial wealth gap, close the homeownership gap, and also address displacement by stabilizing people in place, and that is why we were able to make three new investments in permanently affordable homeownership, that is--and in Perpetuity to successive homebuyers, three investments, one in Capitol Hill, one in Westwood Highland park and one in Southpark just to pause briefly on the Southpark investment, really proud there that habitat for humanity will be connecting and Partnering with Community-Based organizations using affirmative marking and community preference to make sure that folks from South Park who are either at risk for displacement or who have been displaced have an opportunity to be homebuyers in that neighborhood.",112,,
1206,0.97,6821.414,6864.858,"Also we know that there are existing low income homeowners and we want to make sure that those folks have the ability to hold onto their homes, do not face displacement because of the cost of--and have the opportunity to pass on their asset to the next generation and so to support and stabilize those homeowners we made homeowner care grants and loans, we made loans to stabilize--last year and we continue investments in energy efficiency really knowing that the contributions that buildings have two environmental concerns and also making sure that low income people who are homeowners are able to benefit from energy efficiencies in a more comfortable healthy home.",112,,
1207,0.97,6864.858,6870.563,Next slide please.,112,,
1208,0.97,6870.563,6878.271,"So in this map--Councilmember Herbold, yes.",112,,
1209,0.97,6878.271,6886.779,Thank you so much I just wanted to say a word about your work in Southpark.,113,,
1210,0.97,6886.779,6943.036,"That community is fond of saying that it is such a small community that they can actually do a by name list of folks who are vulnerable to displacement, and so for the city of Seattle to really focus some of our investment opportunities and our investment resources there creates potential for a really big impact and I am really pleased to know that not only are we using our resources in that community to address displacement impacts but we are also using the preference policies to help people who have been or are likely to be displaced, we really see a lot of big impact potential there.",113,,
1211,0.97,6943.036,6947.54,Thank you.,113,,
1212,0.97,6947.54,6953.546,"Thank you, we are really proud of the work that we have been able to do, really following the vision and leadership of community in Southpark.",114,,
1213,0.97,6953.546,7124.884,"In this map, you see that our investments from last year overlaid visibly to see them across the city, and this is important because the city has a strong duty and I feel that a strong duty to use our investments in housing two affirmatively further fair housing choice, and that means that we need to be supporting and stabilizing existing low income and communities of color, it means that we need to be undoing historic legacies of--and you probably cs city's ability to further fair housing over many years, so what you see here is not only a single year's investment which I do believe demonstrates that we are investing in multiple locations, but also you see a track record of our previously funded investments to show our commitment to continuing--so in summary, these are the obligations that we set out to the voters and when we make our annual funding investments, especially using our Seattle housing levy resources we want to be sure that we are fulfilling those obligations, ideally we will be exceeding what we commit to the voters, and right now this is a Four- see that we have fully met the rental production and preservation program goals so any additional production we produce will be above that goal, we continue to be on track to meet our goal around reinvestment that is the important work we do to make sure that we have high quality sustainable and--it looks like we are behind but that is a function of timing and that is because when we invest on the capital side on housing especially for our buildings that are supporting extremely low income individuals and families, we often use our--resources in those buildings, but the timing of the award comes roughly 2 years after our capital, so what I can tell you is I have made and started to make the awards for this year and by this year we have fully extended and expanded our program resources.",114,,
1214,0.97,7124.884,7131.39,So next year when we give this presentation you will see that we have met that goal as well.,114,,
1215,0.97,7131.39,7175.668,"We are on track to meet our goals on homelessness prevention and housing stability and also our homeownership program as I reported earlier we continue to do well, so for all of these reasons because we are on track that really frames the conversation that Kelly is going to take over now which is that now is not when we make significant changes to our underlying policy documents, we will make some technical changes or any adjustments to continue to meet our goals but our process progress to date is--underlying policies at this time.",114,,
1216,0.97,7175.668,7183.776,And I will turn it over to Kelly.,114,,
1217,0.97,7183.776,7212.004,"Thank you, so here we are past the halfway mark programs are on track to meet goals and this existing framework that we have has set us up well for a time like--to launch new programs for rental assistance and to build off our current acquisition to take advantage of the real estate market right now so this legislation we are putting forward will make targeted updates to existing policy.",115,,
1218,0.97,7212.004,7230.323,We will start first with the acquisition and preservation program this first proposal will take advantage--allowing the director to exceed the current limit of $30 million for acquisitions of new buildings and sites.,115,,
1219,0.97,7230.323,7249.609,There are two important Guardrails in place the first this can only be done when there are new resources available for long-term financing and also it requires the director to--this is an important tool for taking advantage of extraordinary opportunities we are seeing right now.,115,,
1220,0.97,7249.609,7269.929,"There are three proposed changes in the rental housing program, the first would allow the director to cover up to--for redevelopment of projects that have existing city dollars in then.",115,,
1221,0.97,7269.929,7286.879,As long as they serve extremely low income households and are at risk at foreclosure . The goal is to support small organizations but do not necessarily have access to larger resources and leverage and--critical health and safety updates.,115,,
1222,0.97,7286.879,7302.194,The second proposal will add a requirement for new projects to include broad bad Broadband infrastructure.,115,,
1223,0.97,7302.194,7305.564,We believe that this Aligns with our practice and also Aligns with other Federal requirements in place.,115,,
1224,0.97,7305.564,7324.717,And the third adds language for organizations that utilize--they must add written policy to declare that they will use--or when requested in writing or verbally by a tenant.,115,,
1225,0.97,7324.717,7369.061,"On to the homeownership program we are proposing an increase to the subsidy per unit by $30,000 for development loans and we are on track as you saw in the chart to meet the levy homeownership goals and at the same time we are seeing pretty extraordinary cost increases in the market for lumber and other material so projects have been able to--they are getting closer and closer to the margins and--so we view this subsidy increase as important to enable us to continue meaningfully investing in projects and keeping on track to meet development goals.",115,,
1226,0.97,7369.061,7404.997,Last we will end with a couple minor changes in the home repair program first we are adding language to support the newly funded work of--this work is going to be in just a few months now--to align with statewide program amendments that make all manufactured homeowners eligible so this provision removes requirements that the home be a fixed or permanent foundation--that the home must be owned by the grant applicant.,115,,
1227,0.97,7404.997,7450.309,"Just to cover quickly our Stakeholder engagement process, we engaged the--discussion around several of these proposals--there were no consistent concerns raised--as well as from the other Stakeholder groups and other communications with Stakeholders we communicated with our Blog and newsletter and hosted a public meeting as well, and we believe in the end we were able to strike a balance to accommodate input from the various community members and continue moving forward with these important policy changes.",115,,
1228,0.97,7450.309,7451.444,And that concludes our presentation.,115,,
1229,0.97,7451.444,7498.858,"I think that one last thing I would say is that while the office of housing is the Steward of these policy documents we recognize that they get implemented best when they are underpinned by shared values and all of us moving forward in policy direction, so I do want to acknowledge and thank a lot of Councilmembers for your ideas in helping to move this forward and also for our community partners who end up implement in this and acting as our sounding board for what needs to change over time, thanks to those folks, we really do know that policies will not be useful unless they are implement it well, and so we think our Stakeholders and community partners.",116,,
1230,0.97,7498.858,7506.765,"Thank you again for your presentation and your flexibility, Tracy did you have anything else?",117,,
1231,0.97,7506.765,7517.309,Just to know that the--all included in the ordinance 120101.,118,,
1232,0.97,7517.309,7528.921,"-- if folks do not have any questions, that ordinance will be ready for you to discuss and potentially vote on today.",118,,
1233,0.97,7528.921,7531.49,"Councilmember Herbold, would you like to ask a question?",119,,
1234,0.97,7531.49,7553.345,"First I want to thank you for the work you have done over the last year or so, addressing the issue of mutual termination agreements, I really appreciate the care and thoughtfulness in addressing some of the concerns that I have had in the past.",120,,
1235,0.97,7553.345,7654.046,"Just wondering as far as next steps on that, do we expect for there to be sample policies developed by the office of housing as a best practice and it is my understanding that these policies moving forward are for new housing that is built, not for existing housing that was previously built with levy funds, so I am wondering, can we do something to encourage housing providers to use the standards for mutual termination agreements in all of their housing, not just the new housing that is built moving forward and my other question is--when we met earlier to go over these policies, this is about the home repair technical fix,--are doing so to remove barriers so that folks who live in manufactured homes can benefit from--to understand what we are doing is we are removing the requirement for the homeowner to also own the land which is of course the situation that people who live in manufactured homes often find themselves in but also wondering whether or not this would also allow homeowners who purchased their homes--to avail themselves of the home repair program thank you.",120,,
1236,0.97,7654.046,7656.849,Thank you for those questions.,121,,
1237,0.97,7656.849,7660.753,I will try to take them in order.,121,,
1238,0.97,7660.753,7695.054,"First of all, and Kelly can probably talk more about our approach to discussing specific language on mutual Terminations--I think that you are right that this attaches specifically to new construction, and that is because our vehicle for monitoring is the application for funds from our office and we want to use that as the entry point to engage and monitor new contracts as it relates to mutual Terminations.",121,,
1239,0.97,7695.054,7734.026,"What we find however is that the list of project sponsors I listed earlier, many of our partners have been our partners for a long time, and as we adapt their policy and practice in the future, it tends in locust most cases--because it would not make sense for them to have different policies for one building band for another building so for all Intents and purposes we expect that this will have a practical impact of updating practices in general.",121,,
1240,0.97,7734.026,7775.667,-- what training and engagement would look like--presently homes on a land trust property so where the homeowner owns their home but does not own the ground is already eligible for our programs so this would not impact their eligibility it would only extend it for other properties in manufactured homes who would otherwise --,121,,
1241,0.97,7775.667,7778.67,"They are specifically eligible for home repair loans, great, thank you.",122,,
1242,0.97,7778.67,7781.573,Correct.,123,,
1243,0.97,7781.573,7794.386,I am not seeing any additional hands from colleagues.,124,,
1244,0.97,7794.386,7942.768,"Appreciate the earlier questions that people asked I do want to thank office of housing for your ongoing work on this we did have quite a robust discussion about the--plan two years ago just a reminder of those 2019 and updates we made sure to--in specifically those neighborhoods that are being potentially Gentrified, and we infused Prioritization by--I am going to bring something up related to that in our upcoming topic on the agenda it included stronger labor standards and we also made sure that we increased--to make sure that when opportunities arise to--what you are seeing in the legislation in front of us today is a great opportunity to take advantage of the change in market that Emily talked about potential new acquisition opportunities on the market and the increase in the cost of building means that we can actually go further by acquiring buildings and converting them like the single room occupancy example--the example that was in the news recently of King County purchasing the hotel to turn it into more hotel space and more affordable housing later on this is a thing that we have been interested in for a long time we have increased the authority in the past and we are saying we do not need this cap especially in this time of pressing housing needs--and an increased in cost of construction materials let's acquire these buildings and make sure that there are not derelict properties on the market and let's go in as a purchaser so that we can purchase these buildings in terms of--I am really excited about that, I am also excited about the opportunity to continue to expand upon that and the--legislation--as well as in the bill that we are about to discuss in our Seattle property act bill so thanks again for all of the work that we have done--if we do not have any additional questions and I am not seeing any additional hands or squares, I will move the legislation in front of us so that we can potentially consider it today.",124,,

1254,0.97,8067.559,8083.642,Items 3 and 4 are Council bill 120093 and Council bill 120094--for brief discussion and possible vote.,129,,
1255,0.97,8083.642,8152.511,Okay great so I want to first thank all of you for your patience and participation as--we do have with us--from central staff who has--along with--at the Onset I want to note that we are about 15 minutes over time but we had allocated an hour and a half for this discussion with the hope to get folks out of here by 1:00--and maybe we can get this through this in an hour and 15 minutes but in the case that we do not get through all of--which is very important we do have time held--for a continuation of this meeting so that way we can wrap up our discussion so just know that we are going to try to keep to that 1 P.M.,130,,
1256,0.97,8152.511,8282.54,Hard stop--with that I am really excited to have the legislation in front of us today folks as a reminder this is the Seattle rescue plan this is our effort to introduce and pass the--we have before us the allocation of the first--this is the $116 million out of a total of 202 three through--232--these bills together are a one-time opportunity for us to make significant investments in addressing the disparities we see in terms of what Covid- 19 has exposed in our community in terms of economic instability and who has been hit hardest in--mental and emotional effects and the effects on small businesses and workers this bill is a result as well on--$116 million is not enough to face the important issues facing our city and it is not enough to fully propel us into a more equitable Seattle but this does provide us with an incredible opportunity to commit resources to communities and--these are priorities that we have used in the past to center our efforts around--as well as the budget process that we used last year.,130,,
1257,0.97,8282.54,8295.086,As you saw in the presentation two weeks ago this is an investment directly into homelessness response and--and really making sure that we are directing assistance to where it is most directly impact of.,130,,

1259,0.97,8299.824,8321.513,Thank you for the opportunity to make comments I will keep it brief because I know we are running really long today and I want to express gratitude to you your staff and of course the Mayor on the opportunity to partner in this baseline introduction of the Seattle rescue plan.,131,,
1260,0.97,8321.513,8339.197,I know there are a lot of competing needs as we think about how to best utilize and most strategically utilize these Federal dollars that are coming to the city but I think the plan before us the Seattle rescue plan as we are calling it meets a lot of varying needs throughout the city.,131,,
1261,0.97,8339.197,8415.306,"It would be easy to focus the dollars in just one area of investment, but that means that we are literally picking winners and losers in terms of who gets to benefit and see investments as a result of these one time Federal dollars that are coming into the city of Seattle so I appreciate that this is a bit of a balancing act everything from Childcare providers--to individuals who continue to experience homelessness who need our support, and everything in between so I think this is a good opportunity for the city to meet those varying needs in combination and conjunction with the significant dollars that King County is expecting and that the state is expecting also from the Federal Government, all in all, it is very complementary and I think we will be able to leverage these limited dollars in a way that truly meets a vast spectrum of needs for people in our cities we look forward to the conversation and I appreciate the opportunity to once again partner with you on --",131,,

1266,0.97,8505.096,8537.028,Thank you I appreciate that so just as a reminder we have two bills in front of us the one bill we are talking about first is the larger bill that has all of the various components related to the Seattle rescue plan act the second bill that will discuss after we discussed this bill is specific to the cash allocation so both go hand in glove both relate to the now $128 million --,134,,

1274,0.97,8681.572,8694.652,What is in the summary table is the effects statement from the actual amendment so it is a copy and paste from the amendments themselves so if that is okay with you I will use --,141,,
1275,0.97,8694.652,8701.359,I am just used to seeing it in a certain way.,142,,
1276,0.97,8701.359,8816.174,I am the sponsor of this amendment so I will recognize myself very briefly to summarize what is here I want to offer this amendment to you--they recognize that there is constantly a need to make sure that the dollars we are allocating directly reach--we were talking about the changes that were made in 2019 we did something very similar when we looked at the land distribution bill and--and in working with partnership then in 2019 with organizations like--we recognized that not only was it important then to make sure that there was more money for housing but that there was more money for housing that went to organizations that were led by and staffed by folks historically rooted in--to really try to get at the root of--you will remember that from our conversation two weeks ago when folks from the Roundtable conversations--making sure that--I am proud to offer this amendment and thank the community members for the suggested language they brought forward and you will also see this reflected in the way in which we are hoping to allocate direct cash assistance as well.,142,,
1277,0.97,8816.174,8833.391,I recognize that there is a lot more to work on--about the importance of these dollars getting allocated in this manner.,142,,
1278,0.97,8833.391,8841.299,Are there any additional questions or comments on this amendment?,142,,
1279,0.97,8841.299,8841.499,Okay.,142,,
1280,0.97,8841.499,8843.734,I am hearing none we are off to a fast start.,142,,
1281,0.97,8843.734,8849.674,If there is no additional comments or questions please Madame clerk will you please call the role in favor of amendment number 1?,142,,
1282,0.97,8864.989,8880.471,"[roll being called] five in favor, none opposed.",143,,
1283,0.97,8880.471,8893.684,"The motion carries and amendment number 1 is adopted let's move on to amendment number 2, Councilmember Herbold, as sponsor of this amendment would you like to move it?",144,,
1284,0.97,8893.684,8909.533,"I move amendment number 2, modifying the appropriations to the office of economic development for --",145,,
1285,0.97,8914.672,8917.675,Thank you very much it has been moved and Seconded.,146,,
1286,0.97,8917.675,8927.585,Councilmember Mireles I will --,146,,
1287,0.97,8927.585,9000.958,Amendment to two Council bill 120093--on the proposed funding to support small businesses--the legislation as introduced included--small business technical assistance and--this amendment would provide more specificity to allocate those funds with $7.5 million for investments in businesses and nonprofit grants so direct financial assistance to businesses investments in commercial Affordability would have $2 million for technical assistance and then $7.5 million to provide neighborhood and downtown recovery grants.,147,,
1288,0.97,9000.958,9023.914,And then the amendment also includes two Provisos that would provide more specificity for that--it would allocate $5.5 million for neighborhood recovery grants and then $2 million for downtown specific recovery grants.,147,,
1289,0.97,9023.914,9033.491,With that I will turn it over to the sponsors and I am happy to answer questions.,147,,
1290,0.97,9033.491,9044.835,If there is nothing else for you I will--thank you for your authorship of this amendment and the details that you have suggested in the $22 million allocation.,148,,
1291,0.97,9044.835,9047.338,Please help walk us through anything additional.,148,,
1292,0.97,9047.338,9052.443,I just want to take a few minutes to explain why I am doing this.,149,,
1293,0.97,9052.443,9073.864,This afternoon in my--we will be hearing from Stakeholders about how as you were saying to build an equitable recovery so I want to share with you a little bit about what we are going to hear about then to explain why I am offering those amendments now.,149,,
1294,0.97,9073.864,9088.779,While listening to small businesses arts organizations and--together input on how we should use this Once-In-A- lifetime investment to build a more equitable recovery we heard some pretty clear things from Stakeholders.,149,,
1295,0.97,9088.779,9111.068,"We know that Covid-19 really brought into relief the inequities in our economy but what we learned is two things, first we have learned that there is not enough economic opportunity for folks--either out of work or in low-wage jobs.",149,,
1296,0.97,9111.068,9132.523,"Pre-Covid-19 the number of young firms grew by only 8% in greater Seattle compared to 25% in Denver, 47 percent in Austin there was already a challenge in our community and the way our economy works, second there is in inequitable access to opportunity.",149,,
1297,0.97,9132.523,9142.533,Seattle ranks in the bottom third of large Metro areas for black and Hispanic representation in jobs and managerial roles for example.,149,,
1298,0.97,9142.533,9189.68,"So as we begin to address this not just in terms of needing to invest in racial equity as the center of our thinking we can also be meeting other goals, for example we are talking about becoming a 15 minute city, so we need to create good jobs develop skills that are relevant good job support terms with technical assistance--Act and increasing access--a focus on neighborhood oriented businesses--and help build community assets and wealth.",149,,
1299,0.97,9189.68,9218.309,So this amendment takes into consideration downtown but also the rest of Seattle's important business neighborhood and I want to say I appreciate that downtown recovery is important but the truth is the Dsa has--and other areas of our communities that may not have a Bia or have the ability to assess business owners and property owners to generate revenue for the kinds of things we want to see.,149,,
1300,0.97,9218.309,9245.536,"In addition the downtown core businesses can benefit from and can apply for--we have $3 million for arts and cultural space, we have $2 million for technical assistance, $7.5 million for direct capital assistance, so this is a whole package and there are other ways businesses that are downtown can apply and participate as well.",149,,
1301,0.97,9245.536,9257.214,The last thing I will say is this amendment is a really thoughtful collaboration between several of our offices and represents collective outreach and community engagement.,149,,
1302,0.97,9257.214,9281.238,So I do want to thank my counsel colleagues and--and I do want to thank--for their support in helping craft what I think is a more equitable way of helping distribute these funds.,149,,
1303,0.97,9281.238,9288.345,"Councilmember Herbold, did you have anything else you wanted to add?",150,,
1304,0.97,9288.345,9371.862,"Yes, first off I wanted to thank Councilmember Morales for her leadership in Authoring this amendment--we stated the Council's priorities for relief funds including--to receive relief and support one of the reasons for my focus on the sector as--explained--had the highest percentage in unemployment loss and--55% according to--a regional Crosscut survey of--found that 72% of our organizations say they do not have enough cash on hand to cover operating expenses --",151,,
1305,0.97,9379.403,9396.286,Previous rounds of relief have not benefited cultural organizations.,152,,
1306,0.97,9396.286,9399.957,Cultural excluded from city relief such as the small business stabilization fund.,152,,
1307,0.97,9399.957,9401.125,So lack of a Brick-And-Mortar location.,152,,
1308,0.97,9401.125,9417.341,Seattle arts commissioners have joined us multiple time to express concerns that the King County investment of funds focuses on event Venues and street menus and mostly will benefit larger and white led arts organizations.,152,,
1309,0.97,9417.341,9421.578,Federal relief has focused on shattered Venues.,152,,
1310,0.97,9421.578,9425.015,Only 6% are controlled by communities of color.,152,,
1311,0.97,9425.015,9429.82,And 60 funded by arts.,152,,
1312,0.97,9429.82,9434.625,Fewer than five are eligible for this relief.,152,,
1313,0.97,9434.625,9443.167,Another reason I focused on this is the potential and driving the region's economic recovery if we help them to recover.,152,,
1314,0.97,9443.167,9454.945,"In August 2020 report of the Brookings Institute, they found the creative economy is one of the sectors most at risk of the Covid-19 crisis and there will be Reverberating effects.",152,,
1315,0.97,9454.945,9462.553,"Arts, culture and creativity are one of the three key factors that drive regional economies.",152,,
1316,0.97,9462.553,9475.466,And in the city's creative economy study found the creative sector drives a full 18% of Seattle's GDP which is four times the national average.,152,,
1317,0.97,9475.466,9495.619,"So this amendment will make sure that 3 million goes to the office of arts and culture to administer direct financial assistance and stabilization grants to arts and cultural organizations and businesses needing immediate funding to reopen, bring back staff and continued the critical contributions to the economic, cultural and social vibrancy in Seattle.",152,,
1318,0.97,9495.619,9506.763,"In addition, it will establish a policy intent for businesses and organizations to be eligible for longer-term subsidized financing through a small business recovery fund proposed.",152,,
1319,0.97,9506.763,9515.973,The intent is to make sure they are not structurally excluded from applying as a result of the limitation level decisions.,152,,
1320,0.97,9515.973,9524.414,We appreciate the opportunity to speak to the amendment and thank Councilmember Morales.,152,,
1321,0.97,9524.414,9530.888,"If anyone also like to speak, please do.",153,,
1322,0.97,9530.888,9534.725,I will be looking for your hand.,153,,
1323,0.97,9534.725,9535.158,Please go ahead.,153,,
1324,0.97,9535.158,9538.128,Thank you very much Madam chair.,154,,
1325,0.97,9538.128,9560.384,And I want to thank the sponsors of this amendment in highlighting an issue that I care very deeply about as representative of a district that includes tons of artistic institutions and performance Venues that have experienced the hard brunt of the economic fallout from Covid-19.,154,,
1326,0.97,9560.384,9566.857,"I do want to say that in the current form of this amendment, I can't support it.",154,,
1327,0.97,9566.857,9571.028,And I do have some issues with it.,154,,
1328,0.97,9571.028,9600.857,"I do think that it is really important that we make sure that some of the programmatic things that have been planned through the downtown revitalization Workgroup, that I sit on and that Councilmember Juarez have been counting on and relying on a portion of the allocation that was identified in the original draft.",154,,
1329,0.97,9600.857,9606.863,And some potential implications Unfortunately for some of the programming that is planned for the summer.,154,,
1330,0.97,9606.863,9629.519,"We do know that while all of our business districts around the city have really suffered and been hit by Covid-19, the downtown in particular, which is uniquely vulnerable as a Hub of congregate work, in a way that no other neighborhood in the city is, has really fundamentally been deactivated for essentially a year and a half.",154,,
1331,0.97,9629.519,9648.171,"And the Jumpstarting that congregate work space Hub of the region and coming back from an era where as recently as a couple of months ago, all of us suspected that congregate work itself might be fundamentally revised as we come out of this era.",154,,
1332,0.97,9648.171,9664.755,We know it is not going to be easy to really make sure that the downtown comes back and is humming in a way that we saw Pre-Pandemic as the Premier commercial and cultural Hub of Úthe region.,154,,
1333,0.97,9664.755,9682.272,And so I do think it is important to figure out a way that we can accommodate these investments without also potentially hindering some of the things that are being discussed in the revitalization Workgroup.,154,,
1334,0.97,9682.272,9687.077,There our hundred businesses participating in the welcome back week project that is going to start kicking off in July.,154,,
1335,0.97,9687.077,9702.092,Some of this has the potential element where I want to see more of the overlap because a big part of the revitalization effort is through hiring artists and performers.,154,,
1336,0.97,9702.092,9717.407,I think the plan right now is to hire over 200 broadly characterized creative's to participate in the programming associated with welcome back week and the Beautification of the interior of the city.,154,,
1337,0.97,9717.407,9754.611,"There are concerns that I have around the workforce development bucket that I think, in terms of how the executives have been planning this, will fall under the--what was, in the initial draft, $3 million allocation for downtown, which includes some really critical investments in the hospitality sector, in terms of retraining job placement, case management to place unemployed hospitality workers back into the hospitality economy as the downtown core recovers.",154,,
1338,0.97,9754.611,9758.648,And worry that this will imperil some of those investments.,154,,
1339,0.97,9758.648,9766.756,That is all to say that I just want some time to figure out how to accommodate the very real need.,154,,
1340,0.97,9766.756,9768.024,And also fitting the district.,154,,
1341,0.97,9768.024,9779.336,Which is why this is a difficult vote.,154,,
1342,0.97,9779.336,9780.437,Given district seven.,154,,
1343,0.97,9780.437,9782.672,Making sure there is not one investment to the expenses.,154,,
1344,0.97,9782.672,9794.384,"The other, especially with a lot of these critical programmatic things in the pipeline that a lot of Stakeholders have been planning for in reliance of this money.",154,,
1345,0.97,9794.384,9803.727,One thing I would like to potentially see is if there are ways we can make the end so on the ceiling of the downtown investment a little more flexible.,154,,
1346,0.97,9803.727,9824.848,"I would like to see if potentially, a portion of the funds being put aside for arts investment could maybe be Crafted in a way to Cleave some of it out to support some of the programming efforts in downtown.",154,,
1347,0.97,9824.848,9829.252,It could be another way of delivering the same investment rather than putting it under the original downtown umbrella.,154,,
1348,0.97,9829.252,9848.905,Or figuring out a way to move other investments around the overall package to restore some of the money that would be taken away from some of the downtown programming.,154,,
1349,0.97,9848.905,9867.057,My personal preference would be to table the amendment until Monday to see if something could be worked out to accommodate some of the interests and also see how some of the investments might align.,155,,
1350,0.97,9867.057,9877.667,"In the alternative, I will be voting against the amendment today with the intent to maybe bring some additional amendments on Monday to act in that same spirit.",155,,
1351,0.97,9877.667,9883.64,But I do appreciate the underlying urge to get more investment in the arts community.,155,,
1352,0.97,9883.64,9908.398,"I just don't want to be in the position of, in some cases, robbing Peter to pay Paul, given that there might be some unintended consequences of taking away a resource here and putting it into a similar project somewhere else.",155,,
1353,0.97,9908.398,9909.599,I do appreciate the overall intent.,155,,
1354,0.97,9909.599,9911.868,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Lewis.",156,,
1355,0.97,9911.868,9913.103,I'm not seeing any additional hands right now.,156,,
1356,0.97,9913.103,9914.204,I will offer some comments as well.,156,,
1357,0.97,9914.204,9923.78,"I want to thank the author, Councilmember Morales with the thought that went into this with the other offices.",156,,
1358,0.97,9923.78,9926.216,I think you mentioned Councilmember Herbold's office and Council President Gonzalez's team as well.,156,,
1359,0.97,9926.216,9929.92,Thank you for your work on this amendment.,156,,
1360,0.97,9929.92,9937.394,I think there was a lot of desire to see a little more delineation within that allotment.,156,,
1361,0.97,9937.394,9942.098,And it is feeling like it is on the right track.,156,,
1362,0.97,9942.098,9948.338,Thank you for your work identifying additional support for the cultural community and the creative industry and I appreciate the conversations I have had with members of the arts Commission.,156,,
1363,0.97,9948.338,9956.479,I know this is something they wanted to see not only reflected in the intent in section eight but also how we allocate those dollars.,156,,
1364,0.97,9956.479,9957.547,So I'm very supportive of that.,156,,
1365,0.97,9957.547,9963.053,I want to draw your attention to the last line in the effects box that is on the screen here.,156,,
1366,0.97,9963.053,9968.058,It really notes that the neighborhoods that we are talking about are equity districts.,156,,
1367,0.97,9968.058,9976.266,That is the term we are using to drive home that this is an opportunity for us to create a more equitable recovery.,156,,
1368,0.97,9976.266,9985.375,And that is imperative for us to make sure there are economic hubs and activity taking place across the city and also recognizing that downtown continues to be an economic driver in many aspects.,156,,
1369,0.97,9985.375,9987.077,So wanting to see that on the ballots.,156,,
1370,0.97,9987.077,9996.586,I do appreciate what you put forward today and I am supportive of this amendment.,156,,
1371,0.97,9996.586,9998.621,I also hear that might be additional conversations about flexibility.,156,,
1372,0.97,9998.621,10004.094,"Councilmember Lewis, I look forward to hearing what you have to offers offer and that flexibility vain.",156,,
1373,0.97,10004.094,10006.596,"As you noted, I think there is a lot of overlap.",156,,
1374,0.97,10006.596,10013.57,That could be just a matter of outline where there is overlap in terms of the existing investments in the amendment as drafted.,156,,
1375,0.97,10013.57,10018.875,And how that overlap Correlates with the geographic region of downtown.,156,,
1376,0.97,10018.875,10020.377,I think both are important.,156,,
1377,0.97,10020.377,10028.418,"And I would note that the letters we have received from folks, especially within the downtown business core, emphasize one thing specifically.",156,,
1378,0.97,10028.418,10030.754,That was addressing homelessness.,156,,
1379,0.97,10030.754,10041.498,"And within the proposal you have in front of us, the vast majority of dollars is going into addressing homelessness and housing as the number one priority.",156,,
1380,0.97,10041.498,10044.734,I know it is an approach we are trying to accomplish.,156,,
1381,0.97,10044.734,10053.143,"As the President spoke to, it is important that we not just look at one area for investments but we recognize the corresponding needs here.",156,,
1382,0.97,10053.143,10058.915,"I think there will be more conversation to come, it sounds like, Councilmember Lewis.",156,,
1383,0.97,10058.915,10087.377,"I do support amendment number two in front of us and I appreciate the work you have done together with other counsel offices, Councilmember Morales, to make sure funding is going into the equity districts's cultural Hub A█Nd artistic industry and would love to see where there are more of those concentric circles on how those investments lay with our desire to make sure our downtown core is truly vibrant as well.",156,,
1384,0.97,10087.377,10097.487,I look forward to taking any additional comments on this.,156,,
1385,0.97,10097.487,10099.255,"About no additional hands Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",156,,
1386,0.97,10099.255,10119.476,"Even though we are talking about on paper here, $3 million for the arts and cultural sectors, that is an increase of only $1 million from at the office of economic development is already intending to spend on the sector.",157,,
1387,0.97,10119.476,10136.326,So this should not be looked at as a 3 Million-Dollar cut from the downtown neighborhood revitalization.,157,,
1388,0.97,10136.326,10136.926,Allocation.,157,,
1389,0.97,10136.926,10139.729,"And wondering if, Aly, if you can clarify the previous commitment to downtown.",157,,
1390,0.97,10139.729,10148.905,And just wondering how that might play into our discussions here.,157,,
1391,0.97,10148.905,10151.307,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,158,,
1392,0.97,10151.307,10158.848,"As I had set at the opening, the bill was introduced and did not provide any specificity on how the funds were allocated.",158,,
1393,0.97,10158.848,10175.298,"Following introduction of the bill, the office of economic development and the Mayor's office did share a draft proposal of how the office of economic development was considering allocating the funds for these categories of spending.",158,,
1394,0.97,10175.298,10177.0,And that did include $10 million for neighborhood and downtown recovery grants.,158,,
1395,0.97,10177.0,10185.141,"As you noted, $2 million for investment in arts and cultural organizations.",158,,
1396,0.97,10185.141,10196.986,And so what I will say is that it is unfortunate if commitments were made to Stakeholders about specific funding allocations in advance of the allocations of the funds.,158,,
1397,0.97,10196.986,10209.065,"I will note that in all cases across all investment areas, the amount in the package is not what was requested by the individual Councilmembers or the Mayor.",158,,
1398,0.97,10209.065,10211.501,"I think I would attribute across the board, for all of the investments.",158,,
1399,0.97,10211.501,10212.302,It is a balance.,158,,
1400,0.97,10212.302,10233.59,"One thing I could suggest to Councilmember Lewis and the committee is that one way to do this without changing the allocation of how the dollars are proposed in the various categories--because the other categories, will benefit downtown arts and cultural organizations, businesses and that type of thing.",158,,
1401,0.97,10233.59,10253.343,"Rather than having two provides us, 7.5 million Thatexactly how much for downtown and how much for neighborhoods, it could be one proviso that restricts the 7.5 million for downtown and neighborhood recovery grants and the same language Prioritizing equity districts.",158,,
1402,0.97,10253.343,10260.85,But isn't Pre-Determining exactly how the 7.5 million is allocated between downtown and neighborhoods.,158,,
1403,0.97,10260.85,10265.555,I know the office of economic development is proposing both in the downtown and neighborhood space.,158,,
1404,0.97,10265.555,10277.333,"Some potential to direct allocations to neighborhood districts, cultural districts and that sort of thing and Prioritizing equity districts.",158,,
1405,0.97,10277.333,10300.39,And there were some Rp's in there so that might mean reducing the size of the competitive grants and still doing the direct allocations and supporting the investments that Councilmember Lewis was discussing that might be part of the downtown revitalization--the downtown group to discuss the investments.,158,,
1406,0.97,10300.39,10304.727,That would be one solution I would offer the committee to consider today that we could do verbally.,158,,
1407,0.97,10304.727,10314.27,"Otherwise, I'm happy to work with you, Councilmember Lewis, the amendment sponsors and other Councilmembers on an determinative approach for Monday.",158,,
1408,0.97,10314.27,10321.444,"Councilmember Morales, I saw your hand.",159,,
1409,0.97,10321.444,10322.311,"Thank you, Aly.",160,,
1410,0.97,10322.311,10336.526,"I do want to say that I think, as I said, the amount we Crafted was intended to continue to follow the strategies that were recommended by Oed.",160,,
1411,0.97,10336.526,10337.427,We kept the categories.,160,,
1412,0.97,10337.427,10352.809,"I think it is important to shift the allocation to reflect the conversations we have been having with the business community, neighborhood business organizations.",160,,
1413,0.97,10352.809,10357.046,And my preference would be for us to go ahead and pass this amendment today.,160,,
1414,0.97,10357.046,10375.364,"But I will say I'm totally happy to work with Councilmember Lewis over the next few days before the vote on Monday, to see what we can craft or accommodate for his interest as well.",160,,
1415,0.97,10375.364,10378.067,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,161,,
1416,0.97,10378.067,10379.302,"Councilmember Herbold, did that answer your question?",161,,
1417,0.97,10379.302,10379.635,It did.,162,,
1418,0.97,10379.635,10382.772,"Councilmember to 11, I see her hand up.",163,,
1419,0.97,10382.772,10383.239,Is that a carryover?,163,,
1420,0.97,10383.239,10385.942,"One more comment, Madam chair.",164,,
1421,0.97,10385.942,10391.681,I think I agree on the pacing with Councilmember Morales.,164,,
1422,0.97,10391.681,10399.288,I think I would just assume have us vote on the merits of this amendment today.,164,,
1423,0.97,10399.288,10403.092,"Getting to Aly's point about amending an On-The-Fly, I would rather we be more intentional than that.",164,,
1424,0.97,10403.092,10407.897,I think that is more of something to work on in advance of Monday.,164,,
1425,0.97,10407.897,10415.104,I will certainly take up the opportunity to work on the way.,164,,
1426,0.97,10415.104,10430.92,"We are seeing how we can Harmonize a lot of these things Programmatically . for today, I am going to still be voting against this amendment since my preference would be to do the whole process one time with something we workout by Monday.",164,,
1427,0.97,10430.92,10446.669,I do think it is best to not just put in a last minute walk on amendment not knowing what all the implications are.,164,,
1428,0.97,10446.669,10450.84,So I just wanted to throw that out there.,164,,
1429,0.97,10450.84,10452.275,"But Aly, we will definitely be talking this week.",164,,
1430,0.97,10452.275,10456.345,I appreciate that Councilmember Lewis.,165,,

1433,0.97,10461.517,10462.518,And whether there is overlap.,165,,
1434,0.97,10462.518,10464.921,I'm not seeing any additional hands.,165,,
1435,0.97,10464.921,10472.662,I appreciate the conversation with that.,165,,

1473,0.97,10593.95,10603.059,Do you mind describing that substitute for us and we will turn it back over to both Councilmember Strauss and Councilmember Herbold.,184,,
1474,0.97,10603.059,10605.895,I want to make sure I am sharing the right piece.,185,,
1475,0.97,10605.895,10611.901,I tried to put the revised substitute amendment in front of you.,185,,
1476,0.97,10611.901,10612.835,Are you seeing that on your screen?,185,,
1477,0.97,10612.835,10613.169,We are.,186,,
1478,0.97,10613.169,10613.536,Thank you.,187,,
1479,0.97,10613.536,10633.656,"For those following along at home, the amendment would Express counsel's intent as Councilmember Herbold described, for future appropriations, invest in making this permanent.",188,,
1480,0.97,10633.656,10637.827,The proposed legislation includes funding to make 26 miles permanent.,188,,
1481,0.97,10637.827,10643.132,So this would be following up on the next phase.,188,,
1482,0.97,10643.132,10657.146,With the substitute version does that is different from the original version is it adds specificity about some specific considerations that the Department of transportation would be requested to consider of green Lake way North.,188,,
1483,0.97,10657.146,10678.067,"And it adds some specificity around the community outreach to just reorganize those sentences and make it clear that prior to making final decisions about if the street should be made permanent, that outreach is done and if the answer is yes, how and what permanent changes would be implemented.",188,,
1484,0.97,10678.067,10682.738,So the intent is generally the same.,188,,
1485,0.97,10682.738,10684.273,The substitute version by Councilmember Strauss adds specificity.,188,,
1486,0.97,10684.273,10692.615,And I would note that this version assumes Councilmember Strauss is added as a cosponsor as well.,188,,
1487,0.97,10692.615,10704.26,"I'm going to ask Councilmember Herbold, since you waved your white--your right to speak, if you want to speak first and then Councilmember Strauss is the author of the substitute if you would like to speak.",189,,

1489,0.97,10711.167,10715.571,I will speak specifically to the interest for the Alki neighborhood.,190,,
1490,0.97,10715.571,10732.755,A point has been mobilized for quite some time now about the current moving Street and a stay healthy street.,190,,
1491,0.97,10732.755,10745.034,We have received over 75 E- mails in support of this particular amendment as a way of ensuring that there is funding that will be used in future allocations.,190,,
1492,0.97,10745.034,10746.202,To address this need.,190,,
1493,0.97,10746.202,10766.956,"Regular meetings with community members from Alki point since June of last year that I have posted in order to lift up the interest, nay for's own data shows that Alki point is the most used moving Street or stay healthy street in the city.",190,,
1494,0.97,10766.956,10778.868,If you want to conduct your own survey as well and have over 1000 signatures to make it permanent.,190,,
1495,0.97,10778.868,10788.677,"The respondent, only 28.5% live within a half-mile of the Alki point keep moving.",190,,
1496,0.97,10788.677,10803.159,And what that indicates is that there is broad interest outside of the Alki neighborhoods in maintaining the Alki point keep moving Street and make it a permanent stay healthy street.,190,,
1497,0.97,10803.159,10820.409,Because everyone is using the area in a way that is consistent with our interest in promoting open spaces that many people use regardless of the proximity to those spaces.,190,,
1498,0.97,10820.409,10835.825,The transportation Department director has committed to the community that they keep it moving Street will remain in its current state while S.D.O.T.,190,,
1499,0.97,10835.825,10836.892,Completes the community engagement.,190,,
1500,0.97,10836.892,10855.744,And the community is also seeking the park's Department engagement and looking forward to hearing from the superintendent about how this designation is enhancing the use of the open space that benefits the park system.,190,,
1501,0.97,10855.744,10879.668,"So this amendment would support funding and future appropriations to conduct community outreach and provide potential resources needed to make what is currently they keep it moving street, a permanent stay healthy street.",190,,
1502,0.97,10879.668,10879.969,Thank you.,190,,
1503,0.97,10879.969,10886.275,Wonderful.,191,,
1504,0.97,10886.275,10889.979,"Councilmember Strauss, as the author of the substitute in front of us, do you have additional comments?",191,,
1505,0.97,10889.979,10906.295,"Justin pointing out the conflicts at West green Lake way North, it is a conflict I brought up at counsel briefing and every briefing for the last month or maybe longer.",192,,
1506,0.97,10906.295,10908.897,The street closure here is overall beneficial to the community.,192,,
1507,0.97,10908.897,10917.306,"In particular because of the parks Department's decision that I support wholeheartedly, to move bikes off of the inner loop of the trail.",192,,
1508,0.97,10917.306,10929.818,That means that bicycles need to have another place to move around green Lake on the outer loop.,192,,
1509,0.97,10929.818,10934.49,Currently there has been no Repaving project around the majority of green Lake that has provided a two a protected on the inside loop.,192,,
1510,0.97,10934.49,10944.133,"Outer Loop, around green Lake on the inside of the street.",192,,
1511,0.97,10944.133,10944.7,Sorry.,192,,
1512,0.97,10944.7,10946.068,Green Lake is always a mouthful.,192,,
1513,0.97,10946.068,10964.053,"I bring this up because, in my walks with the parks Department and S.D.O.T., the is clear that there is enough Right-Of-Way within green Lake going North from the putt putt golf to the 63Rd Street Underpass for two a protected bike Lane and two a car traffic.",192,,
1514,0.97,10964.053,10982.037,It is a different Street than many of the area because with in park and green Lake both create beneficial park space and it also creates a difficulty in getting from the South end of the Lake to the North end of the Lake for some.,192,,
1515,0.97,10982.037,10995.951,"I bring us forward because also I have noticed--at first I want to bring this forward to say, to complete a connected bike facility around the Lake.",192,,
1516,0.97,10995.951,11005.995,"And I noticed at the Linden Avenue Wynonna Avenue crossing of Aurora Avenue, that there is no bike Lane there.",192,,
1517,0.97,11005.995,11021.877,"And so more than anything else, I want to see us make sure that we have a safe facility for people of all ages and abilities to ride their bike around green Lake in a low stress environment.",192,,
1518,0.97,11021.877,11042.097,"And I think this language Reallywhat I have been advocating for, that we need to have that connected facility all the way around the Lake and that we need to reinstate the ability for people to pass through West green Lake when driving cars.",192,,
1519,0.97,11042.097,11047.903,I appreciate the chair and Councilmember Herbold's support of this change.,192,,

1565,0.97,11203.692,11204.66,Let's move on to amendment number four.,223,,
1566,0.97,11204.66,11209.798,"Councilmember Herbold, this is an amendment you brought forward.",224,,
1567,0.97,11209.798,11210.332,Would like to move it?,224,,
1568,0.97,11210.332,11212.668,Thank you.,225,,
1569,0.97,11212.668,11219.041,I move counsel bill 120093 that modifies the intent language regarding Rv storage.,225,,
1570,0.97,11219.041,11219.441,Wonderful.,226,,
1571,0.97,11219.441,11222.411,I will second that.,226,,
1572,0.97,11222.411,11224.212,And Aly him would you like to describe the amendment in more detail.,226,,
1573,0.97,11224.212,11235.524,"Counsel amendment 120092 would add intent language that would guide the $500,000 in the bill as introduced.",227,,
1574,0.97,11235.524,11240.429,But no specific language about the expectations that with the intent of those dollars are.,227,,
1575,0.97,11240.429,11252.307,Is to create an Rv storage area for households experiencing homelessness to accept offers of shelter for housing.,227,,
1576,0.97,11252.307,11282.17,"The idea here is that in order for a person who has a home, or what they consider a home, living in their Rv, they may be at a greater willingness to accept shelter or housing if they have some assurance that the asset that they have can be securely stored for a period of time until they are certain that the new housing or shelter option is stable and something that will be sustained.",227,,
1577,0.97,11282.17,11285.007,And I will turn it back to the sponsor to add more there.,227,,
1578,0.97,11285.007,11289.444,I will note for the record that amendment number four was published on the agenda last week.,228,,
1579,0.97,11289.444,11292.981,I appreciate you getting that and on time.,228,,
1580,0.97,11292.981,11303.191,And what we have in front of us today is version two with those slight melt modifications Aly described.,228,,
1581,0.97,11303.191,11304.226,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold for your work.",228,,
1582,0.97,11304.226,11306.495,Aly did a great job of describing the intent.,229,,
1583,0.97,11306.495,11311.066,I appreciate the opportunity to bring this amendment to the last Finance and housing meeting.,229,,
1584,0.97,11311.066,11335.724,"I suggested that Rv storage might be an appropriate use of funds . and working with counsel central staff, it was suggested that instead of waiting for the next challenge, it would be impossible to amend intent language here to allow for spending a portion of these funds on Rv storage as part of the proposed Rv safe pilot.",229,,
1585,0.97,11335.724,11358.747,"Again, Rv storage is part of the spectrum, or could be part of the spectrum of responses to helping people who are living in Rvs who may worry that if they move out of the Rv into housing, that the Rv may be stolen, impounded or fall into greater disrepair if they accept the referral.",229,,
1586,0.97,11358.747,11375.931,"Not providing Rv storage can be a deterrent to accepting shelter for folks who, in many cases, have been unstable he housed for a long period of time and who understandably may fear losing their biggest asset which has, in their experience, doubled as a secure home.",229,,
1587,0.97,11375.931,11376.732,So the amendment does just as.,229,,
1588,0.97,11376.732,11392.647,It allows additional flexibility in the way the funds can be spent and it provides another option for folks who are surviving in Rvs that might be interested in a shelter referral if they did not lose the Rv as a result.,229,,
1589,0.97,11392.647,11394.583,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,230,,
1590,0.97,11394.583,11396.451,I'm not seeing any hands.,230,,
1591,0.97,11396.451,11410.665,I want to note my support for this moment as well including access to safe lots which was really important for me in this Arpa legislation we have in front of us especially with the imposition of the 72 hour rule as it relates to Rvs.,230,,
1592,0.97,11410.665,11429.117,"We want there to be a safe place for folks to go with access to hygiene and counseling services and as you note, wanting to make sure they also don't see any impediments going to come not just a safe lot but into more secure housing by way of losing the Rv.",230,,
1593,0.97,11429.117,11437.025,It is a really important opportunity to make sure that folks are treated Holistically and that we address any concerns that they may have.,230,,
1594,0.97,11437.025,11437.459,So I supported.,230,,
1595,0.97,11437.459,11438.693,Thank you for your work in bringing it forward.,230,,
1596,0.97,11438.693,11441.329,No other questions or comments that I am seeing.,231,,

1621,0.97,11500.589,11505.494,Of them if I would modify some intent language in the bill is introduced.,247,,
1622,0.97,11505.494,11528.917,"As introduced, the bill appropriate over $20 million for investments in housing to acquire or develop new affordable housing and it included an intent statement but the Mayor and the Council intent to invest at least $40 million in total of Federal funds or other sources to support the acquisition of affordable housing.",247,,
1623,0.97,11528.917,11536.124,"This amendment, sponsored by Councilmember Strauss, would increase the commitment from 40 million, to $60 million total.",247,,
1624,0.97,11536.124,11537.359,I will turn it over to the sponsor.,247,,
1625,0.97,11537.359,11537.926,Councilmember Strauss.,248,,
1626,0.97,11537.926,11540.829,"Thank you, chair.",249,,

1629,0.97,11547.135,11554.509,I wanted to see us spend more money creating permanent housing then we have in the spill.,249,,
1630,0.97,11554.509,11556.645,"Short, I did not want to take from Underfunding sources.",249,,
1631,0.97,11556.645,11565.62,"Because, chair, you, the Council President did an excellent job bringing together this agreed-upon package.",249,,
1632,0.97,11565.62,11566.555,The negotiations began in March.,249,,
1633,0.97,11566.555,11571.526,We are now here at the end of June.,249,,
1634,0.97,11571.526,11583.271,"Rather than take from another pot of money that has been agreed upon, I went to set the Goalposts and set the stake in the ground for the second charge of funding to increase it to $60 million total.",249,,
1635,0.97,11583.271,11583.738,"Thank you, chair.",249,,
1636,0.97,11583.738,11584.272,Appreciate that.,250,,
1637,0.97,11584.272,11592.747,"Coming on the heels of the office of housing, I think we have the context as to why the acquisition funding is so important.",250,,
1638,0.97,11592.747,11593.982,Thank you for your work on that.,250,,
1639,0.97,11593.982,11599.287,Not seeing any additional hands.,250,,

1641,0.97,11599.788,11615.87,"For clarity sake, in voting for this amendment, we are, innocence, making a commitment for the next round of funding, to at least $31.5 million, for permanent housing capital costs.",251,,
1642,0.97,11615.87,11617.572,Is that correct?,251,,
1643,0.97,11617.572,11629.184,"Councilmember, I'm just pulling up the exact language of the intent statement.",252,,
1644,0.97,11629.184,11637.525,"It talks about, for future appropriation bills, to provide funding to the office of housing.",252,,
1645,0.97,11637.525,11648.303,It doesn't necessarily find you using the Clfr funds for the purpose.,252,,
1646,0.97,11648.303,11657.746,"As Councilmembers are considering the 2022 proposed budget, there will be a number of funding sources where you want to consider investments in certain areas.",252,,
1647,0.97,11657.746,11668.056,And there may be reasons why one fund sources better Prioritized for direct aid to small businesses because of the flexibility and use of those funds versus housing.,252,,
1648,0.97,11668.056,11675.363,"Through the fall budget process, what this would be saying is that at least $60 million of additional funding would be appropriated.",252,,
1649,0.97,11675.363,11680.535,But you would have some flexibility to consider exactly how to allocate those funds.,252,,
1650,0.97,11680.535,11687.275,"In addition to other Federal funds, targeted aid that may be available versus use of this direct aid.",252,,

1652,0.97,11688.743,11696.451,"Counsel, did you have anything to add?",254,,
1653,0.97,11696.451,11701.556,"To clarify, it would be an additional $31.5 million that you might find in the fall budget process.",255,,
1654,0.97,11701.556,11707.062,Not 60 million additional.,255,,
1655,0.97,11707.062,11707.796,Great.,256,,

1679,0.97,11753.508,11760.648,"Councilmember Morales, you are the author of this next amendment, amendment number six.",269,,

1685,0.97,11782.771,11783.671,I'm happy to.,271,,
1686,0.97,11783.671,11786.574,If I could just clarify something.,271,,
1687,0.97,11786.574,11789.244,All of the information was correct.,271,,
1688,0.97,11789.244,11801.589,"I just want to know, the $20.5 million introduced in the version is both the direct aid, the Cflr funds and the 12.2 million of home funds.",271,,
1689,0.97,11801.589,11803.791,"So it is targeted aid and direct aid, already a mix.",271,,
1690,0.97,11803.791,11805.193,That is sort of what I was getting at.,271,,
1691,0.97,11805.193,11815.57,"For the total investment, that will determine which exact fund sources is the right one just for housing with the goal of at least $60 million.",271,,

1694,0.97,11837.258,11841.529,"The bill, as introduced, included $500,000 for this purpose.",273,,
1695,0.97,11841.529,11844.332,So this would increase the funding to a million dollars.,273,,
1696,0.97,11844.332,11857.345,"That would be achieved by cutting $500,000 proposed foreign investment in youth employment for partnerships with community based organizations about provide preemployment programming.",273,,
1697,0.97,11857.345,11859.747,So the funds going to the port would also support similar types of investments.,273,,
1698,0.97,11859.747,11862.684,It would all be part of the sports program.,273,,
1699,0.97,11862.684,11874.762,"Originally, the discussions around both of these investment areas, the original asks were much larger.",273,,
1700,0.97,11874.762,11882.237,"So in the end, both were scaled down significantly in order for us to get a package that doesn't spend more dollars then we had available.",273,,
1701,0.97,11882.237,11889.177,"However, in looking at it more carefully, I think the author was considering what will be the most Impactful.",273,,
1702,0.97,11889.177,11897.952,So looking at combining the resources and making one investment in programs that support youth employment.,273,,
1703,0.97,11897.952,11898.386,Excellent.,274,,
1704,0.97,11898.386,11903.758,Thank you.,274,,

1706,0.97,11906.794,11907.395,Sure.,275,,
1707,0.97,11907.395,11912.6,"I will say quickly that as we heard from Commissioner Bowman this morning, my office has been working with four commissioners.",275,,
1708,0.97,11912.6,11920.475,"Bowman and Hawkins, to expand the current opportunity initiative.",275,,
1709,0.97,11920.475,11924.479,"As I mentioned before, an important strategy for equitable recovery is to increase access to opportunity.",275,,
1710,0.97,11924.479,11935.123,That means increasing skills that lead particularly young people to Union jobs with living wages and with career paths.,275,,
1711,0.97,11935.123,11936.991,"So last summer, the program was very successful with the port.",275,,
1712,0.97,11936.991,11944.933,This investment would allow us to expand the program to offer Internships for the school year instead of just for the summer.,275,,
1713,0.97,11944.933,11951.139,"And chair Mosqueda, I think we cleared this with you ahead of time.",275,,
1714,0.97,11951.139,11956.044,"But we do have a short Video that was made with the young people from last year that I would like to show, if that is possible.",275,,
1715,0.97,11956.044,11957.612,It is fairly brief.,275,,
1716,0.97,11957.612,11959.981,How brief is fairly brief?,276,,
1717,0.97,11959.981,11966.054,A few minutes.,277,,
1718,0.97,11966.054,11968.957,We can just a part of it.,278,,
1719,0.97,11968.957,11976.064,I really think it would be valuable to hear directly from the young people themselves.,278,,
1720,0.97,11976.064,11987.775,So doors all from my office is on and will get us started.,278,,

1729,0.97,12026.781,12037.091,"Learning construction from instructors, learning about afford housing and construction and some really cool modular techniques that are quite cutting edge.",280,,
1730,0.97,12037.091,12042.53,The program gives skills from all sorts.,281,,
1731,0.97,12042.53,12044.332,Not just one skill you will learn.,281,,

1736,0.97,12053.241,12054.742,A lot of different nails and screws.,281,,
1737,0.97,12054.742,12056.01,And how to use tool safety.,281,,
1738,0.97,12056.01,12060.181,It has been a fun experienced.,281,,

1741,0.97,12070.458,12076.764,"From the beginning, we saw that there was a huge need to have employment for youth.",283,,
1742,0.97,12076.764,12082.737,The opportunity initiative accomplishes two of the port's goals.,283,,
1743,0.97,12082.737,12084.939,One is to help those families and youth adversely affected by Covid-19.,283,,
1744,0.97,12084.939,12093.781,And then also to build the pipeline for youth that might be interested in port related careers.,283,,
1745,0.97,12093.781,12097.185,The program is a very exciting one for us.,284,,
1746,0.97,12097.185,12103.057,I think what we will do is go ahead and move the position along.,285,,
1747,0.97,12103.057,12107.895,We will come back to the Video at the end of the meeting if that is okay.,285,,
1748,0.97,12107.895,12109.63,Because I think we would be interested in seeing the rest of it.,285,,

1750,0.97,12111.065,12125.513,"The last thing I will say is that as we talk about building more housing, Scaling up the production of housing, one thing we have learned is that we don't have enough workers in the construction trades.",286,,

1754,0.97,12139.994,12145.933,And I'm really excited about the opportunity to provide our young people with some employment opportunity and some skill building.,286,,
1755,0.97,12145.933,12146.3,"So, thank you.",286,,

1776,0.97,12200.321,12201.422,"Councilmember Morales, congratulations.",299,,
1777,0.97,12201.422,12202.957,The motion carries an amendment number six is adapted.,299,,
1778,0.97,12202.957,12207.395,So the last minute for this bill.,299,,

1780,0.97,12208.996,12209.897,This is amendment number seven.,299,,

1784,0.97,12220.308,12220.841,Moved and Seconded.,302,,
1785,0.97,12220.841,12228.95,"Aly, do you mind describing this amendment.",303,,
1786,0.97,12228.95,12256.143,"Amendment seven Woodcut $200,000 that was proposed for the Department of parks and recreation and keep the $200,000 in the same Department but move it to a different budget summary level and specify that the funds are to be used to support the recreation in the streets program which supports Playgrounds, parks and recreation and across the city.",304,,
1787,0.97,12256.143,12267.855,This will make sure that none of the Federal funds are used to contract with the Seattle Policewomen or outside organizations for armed security services to meet the park security needs.,304,,
1788,0.97,12267.855,12281.802,"So the original proposal, $200,000, would have supported security services for Beach closures at Alki and golden gardens and make sure no Federal funds are used for that purpose.",304,,
1789,0.97,12281.802,12282.97,Thank you so much.,305,,
1790,0.97,12282.97,12283.371,Appreciated.,305,,
1791,0.97,12283.371,12284.872,I will speak briefly to this amendment.,305,,
1792,0.97,12284.872,12295.383,"Colleagues, as we were crafting the bill, one of the things he wanted to make sure is that the funding went directly to those communities most impacted by Covid-19.",305,,
1793,0.97,12295.383,12302.99,And then includes making sure there are great arts and cultural activities as we described earlier and the opportunity to activate.,305,,
1794,0.97,12302.99,12310.798,"Originally, when we inquired about the line item related to security, we were not sure the money was not going to SPD.",305,,
1795,0.97,12310.798,12313.901,It turned out there was a potential interest there.,305,,
1796,0.97,12313.901,12316.704,We want to make sure we are putting these dollars directly into the parks programs.,305,,
1797,0.97,12316.704,12324.211,"And that the funding does not go to SPD as Aly noted, which was an important aspect for me and I believe other members as well.",305,,
1798,0.97,12324.211,12335.623,Much of what you see here is to make sure that we are investing in upstream investments on the Covid-19 seven proposal is part of our greater commitment to create greater stability among our community.,305,,
1799,0.97,12335.623,12356.944,"And the reallocation funding here, which is in alignment with what the executive has agreed to as well, is seen as a doable item here related to parks activation and also make sure that we are not putting funding for additional arms security, which is important.",305,,
1800,0.97,12356.944,12357.812,Any additional comments or questions?,305,,
1801,0.97,12357.812,12358.145,Okay.,306,,
1802,0.97,12358.145,12364.952,I'm seeing on.,306,,
1803,0.97,12364.952,12367.221,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",306,,
1804,0.97,12367.221,12369.323,I am inquiring to understand the impact of this amendment.,307,,
1805,0.97,12369.323,12378.466,My understanding that the parks Department already has funding for this work which has already been--has already begun.,307,,
1806,0.97,12378.466,12385.873,And will be able to continue and services provided to the parks Department will not be impacted by the change.,307,,
1807,0.97,12385.873,12394.181,And will be funded using existing funds.,307,,
1808,0.97,12394.181,12400.621,Looking to get confirmation from the understanding from Aly or anyone on counsel.,307,,
1809,0.97,12400.621,12404.792,"Councilmember Herbold, you are correct.",308,,
1810,0.97,12404.792,12414.201,The parks Department has already provided security services for Beach closures starting in April.,308,,
1811,0.97,12414.201,12415.002,Those services will continue.,308,,
1812,0.97,12415.002,12425.846,"So this change will not result in eliminating security, or speech closures support for parks at Alki and golden gardens.",308,,
1813,0.97,12425.846,12435.923,"I would just note that the parks Department budget, there were significant cuts in the 2021 adopted budget.",308,,
1814,0.97,12435.923,12443.731,And they were looking at different ways to balance experiences and continue to provide these things.,308,,
1815,0.97,12443.731,12460.548,This will make sure that no federal funding is used for any security services but the services will continue and the Federal dollars are released and used to support investments in community programming which is partially funded in the adopted budget.,308,,
1816,0.97,12460.548,12468.055,Thank you so much.,309,,
1817,0.97,12468.055,12468.823,Great.,310,,
1818,0.97,12468.823,12478.365,I think the overall concern I had when I heard about this was that we really don't need armed officers helping to inform youth that it is time to put out the fire.,310,,
1819,0.97,12478.365,12484.572,"And we will look forward to working with you, Councilmember Herbold, as the chair of public safety on the ongoing issue.",310,,
1820,0.97,12484.572,12492.479,I appreciate that there is funding going into important programs like Rec in the streets.,310,,
1821,0.97,12492.479,12493.013,Any additional comments?,310,,
1822,0.97,12493.013,12508.996,I just want to say that I think some of the folks in the South precinct would agree that it would be great if the use of their resources for this function was minimized.,311,,
1823,0.97,12508.996,12521.242,But these are--this is the SPD responding to the parks Department requests.,311,,
1824,0.97,12521.242,12521.876,Requests for assistance.,311,,
1825,0.97,12521.876,12553.674,"In order to facilitate what I think is a goal which is a reduced presence of police officers to facilitate parks and closures, we need to get the support of parks and using more of the on staff to do this work when it is safe.",311,,
1826,0.97,12553.674,12554.208,Great.,312,,
1827,0.97,12554.208,12554.608,Good point.,312,,
1828,0.97,12554.608,12554.942,More to come.,312,,
1829,0.97,12554.942,12566.32,"No additional comments, Madame clerk, can you please call the role on the adoption of amendment number seven.",313,,

1843,0.97,12579.667,12585.506,The emotion--the motion carries an amendment number seven is adapted.,325,,
1844,0.97,12585.506,12587.675,"Colleagues, that is the end of our amendments unless there any Walk-Ins.",325,,
1845,0.97,12587.675,12594.648,I'm not hearing any.,325,,

1850,0.97,12602.356,12604.959,I know we double booked you accidentally.,325,,
