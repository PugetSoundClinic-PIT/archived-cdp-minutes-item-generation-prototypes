21,0.97,77.744,85.785,"As a reminder, the Council President is not officially a member of this Committee, so she is here to discuss but will not actually be able to vote on this bill.",12,,

25,0.97,102.769,113.413,"We are always looking for ways to make this better, excite does remain our strong intent as a Council to have public comment regularly included in our Agendas.",12,,
26,0.97,113.413,125.925,But as a Council we do reserve the right to modify the public comment periods at any point if we deem that the system is being abused or is unsuitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently.,12,,
27,0.97,125.925,130.063,I will moderate the public comment period in the following manner.,12,,
28,0.97,130.063,132.398,The public comment period for this meeting is 20 minutes.,12,,
29,0.97,132.398,137.303,"I think we only have a few folks signed up, but we will see how we go.",12,,
30,0.97,137.303,141.074,Each Speaker will be given two minutes to speak.,12,,

33,0.97,156.689,165.031,"Once I call your name, staff will Unmute the appropriate microphone and you will hear an automatic prompt of you have been Unmuted.",12,,
34,0.97,165.031,169.235,"At that time, you need to push Star six to begin speaking.",12,,

43,0.97,235.902,239.172,"Without this, many platforms list restaurants without their knowledge.",13,,
44,0.97,239.172,248.548,Customers assume the restaurants have agreed to be listed of an delivery platform and will place blame on a restaurant for issues that arise with their order.,13,,
45,0.97,248.548,252.318,This can cause damage to their reputation and success.,13,,
46,0.97,252.318,266.299,"By requiring that food delivery platforms operating in Seattle first obtain a written agreement with any restaurant prior to offering Take-Out or delivery services, this legislation will ensure the best customer experience with accurate pricing, menu options and the best quality food.",13,,
47,0.97,266.299,273.606,The Seattle restaurant alliance would like to thank Council President Gonzalez for her leadership on this issue.,13,,

49,0.97,274.274,279.979,"Thank you, Iowa Austin.",14,,

51,0.97,280.88,286.819,"Melissa, please press Star six and go ahead.",14,,
52,0.97,286.819,289.355,"Hi, thank you very much.",15,,

57,0.97,307.774,316.949,Which in part is supposed to help the city determine if a film Commission was needed to support and grow the film industry.,15,,
58,0.97,316.949,324.957,"In November of 2020, the city didn't recommend the creation of the Commission and in April they postponed that decision.",15,,
59,0.97,324.957,335.835,Today with complete due respect the Seattle music commissioners and Lgbtq commissioners who are about to be reinstated or sworn in--as recommended.,15,,
60,0.97,335.835,361.794,"And as a compromise, the film task force will accept that a Commission may not be seated until the next Murgs but that the legislation be created now in order for the film industry to see that the city supports this need, especially as the city is deciding how to reorganize film and music and other creative industries and set priorities for recovery and support of our industry.",15,,
61,0.97,361.794,362.862,Thank you.,15,,
62,0.97,362.862,368.101,"Thank you, Melissa.",16,,
63,0.97,368.101,368.501,Next we have Abby.,16,,
64,0.97,368.501,384.05,"Abby, if you're with us, you'll need to push Star six so that we can hear you.",16,,
65,0.97,384.05,389.489,"Abby, are you there?",16,,
66,0.97,389.489,398.965,"I see you, but you are muted as far as I can tell.",16,,
67,0.97,398.965,401.968,Can you push Star six?,16,,
68,0.97,401.968,405.671,Okay.,16,,

70,0.97,411.411,415.148,"Oh, hello, can you hear me now?",17,,
71,0.97,415.148,416.482,There we go.,18,,
72,0.97,416.482,417.25,Okay.,19,,
73,0.97,417.25,422.088,"Sorry, I don't--I don't understand why my phone was doing that.",19,,
74,0.97,422.088,422.455,"Hello, everyone.",19,,
75,0.97,422.455,426.626,Thank you so much for giving me the time to comment today.,19,,
76,0.97,426.626,433.199,"My name is Abby, and I am a writer and director in the Seattle film industry.",19,,
77,0.97,433.199,439.205,I'm also a part of multiple organizations and events that are Film-Related here in the Seattle area.,19,,
78,0.97,439.205,446.112,And I have my own production company that helps to bring diverse voices to film and television.,19,,
79,0.97,446.112,457.757,"Along with Melissa, I am a member of the Seattle film task force, which I was able to join early last year amongst the middle of the protests that I was involved in.",19,,
80,0.97,457.757,469.936,"It was one of those situations that hearing the news that the film--Seattle film Commission wasn't going to be proceeded by the city, it was very upsetting to hear that.",19,,
81,0.97,469.936,485.952,"And it felt like it was another situation where, you know, we as people of color are told that, you know, diversity and the like is going to be brought to our film industry.",19,,
82,0.97,485.952,492.024,And the Commission was supposed to help make sure that that was something to happen.,19,,
83,0.97,492.024,515.948,"What is upsetting is that the fact that amongst all of the policy that we put together we were postponed, unsure when, not given an actual date of when we were supposed to come back or even have the option of bringing a Seattle film Commission.",19,,
84,0.97,515.948,528.027,"And it is important to me along as a number of other Filmmakers in this area to make sure that that is considered, especially when you all are making your decisions.",19,,
85,0.97,528.027,531.097,Thank you very much for my time.,19,,
86,0.97,531.097,532.265,"Thank you, Abby.",20,,
87,0.97,532.265,537.303,I do not see any other folks signed up.,20,,
88,0.97,537.303,539.171,Just want to confirm that.,20,,
89,0.97,539.171,546.279,There are no other public comment registrants.,21,,
90,0.97,546.279,546.546,Great.,22,,
91,0.97,546.546,547.346,"Thank you, sun.",22,,
92,0.97,547.346,549.448,That concludes our list of speakers from the general public.,22,,
93,0.97,549.448,557.023,We will move on to the first item on our agenda.,22,,
94,0.97,557.023,561.06,Will you please read item one into the record?,22,,
95,0.97,561.06,574.507,"Agenda item one, council bill 120092 relating to the regulation of food delivery businesses and platforms, adding a new chapter 7.30 to the Seattle municipal code.",23,,
96,0.97,574.507,575.074,Thank you very much.,24,,
97,0.97,575.074,581.881,"We do have Yolanda here from central staff and Council President Gonzalez, whose bill this is.",24,,
98,0.97,581.881,589.855,"So I will pass this to you, Council President, and let you introduce your bill.",24,,
99,0.97,589.855,591.123,Sure.,25,,
100,0.97,591.123,594.527,I'll make some remarks after Yolanda's presentation.,25,,
101,0.97,594.527,600.199,So I'm going to go ahead and defer my comments until Yolanda has gone through her presentation.,25,,
102,0.97,600.199,606.772,And then I'm happy to make some comments before we make a motion.,25,,
103,0.97,606.772,607.073,Thank you.,25,,
104,0.97,607.073,607.54,Great.,26,,
105,0.97,607.54,608.507,"Yolanda, please go ahead.",26,,
106,0.97,608.507,608.975,Okay.,27,,
107,0.97,608.975,619.819,I am going to load up this presentation.,27,,
108,0.97,619.819,622.021,"Yolanda Seattle central staff, for the record.",27,,
109,0.97,622.021,623.623,"Can you see that Okay, chair?",27,,
110,0.97,623.623,623.856,Yes.,28,,
111,0.97,623.856,640.906,I'm going to provide an overview of the proposed legislation that would require food delivery platforms to establish a written agreement with a restaurant prior to offering Take-Out or delivery services for that restaurant.,29,,
112,0.97,640.906,641.374,Council bill 120092.,29,,
113,0.97,641.374,652.518,"It was drafted under the direction of Council President Gonzalez and will be providing context for this legislation, summarize the Council bill and describe potential impacts of the proposal.",29,,
114,0.97,652.518,662.695,All of this was covered in my memo that is also attached to the agenda.,29,,
115,0.97,662.695,673.873,"So food delivery platforms such as Grubhub, Uber eats and Doordash have steadily grown in popularity with the widespread adoption of Smartphones in recent years.",29,,
116,0.97,673.873,676.909,This chart illustrates growth of all food delivery platforms in the United States.,29,,
117,0.97,676.909,686.419,"The blue bars are the number of users in the millions, and the axis to the left and the Orange line is the year over year growth.",29,,
118,0.97,686.419,688.721,The axis is on the right.,29,,
119,0.97,688.721,695.528,"For reference, average annual growth was about 10% between 2015 and 2020.",29,,
120,0.97,695.528,728.427,"The spike in growth between 2019 and 2020 is due to impacts of the pandemic, which heightened demand for these services due to a variety of factors, including restrictions on indoor dining to help prevent the spread of Covid-19, people just staying home because they were concerned about being potentially exposed to the virus and community interest in continuing to support their local restaurants, even in a time of crisis.",29,,
121,0.97,728.427,736.635,So competition between food delivery platforms for revenue and market share has resulted in a number of practices that have caused problems for restaurants.,29,,
122,0.97,736.635,743.609,Some of these include charging delivery Commission fees that sometimes range as high as 30% of the order's total.,29,,
123,0.97,743.609,751.15,This is currently capped in Seattle at 15% too to the civil emergency order that was passed last April.,29,,
124,0.97,751.15,762.294,And then more--and recently in 2019 food delivery platforms began adding restaurants on to their Online listings without these restaurants' knowledge or permission.,29,,
125,0.97,762.294,767.5,This slide provides a general description of two key terms.,29,,
126,0.97,767.5,769.935,There are partnered restaurants versus Nonpartnered restaurants.,29,,
127,0.97,769.935,781.514,The key difference here that partnered restaurants have an agreement with the delivery platform so their menu information is accurate and restaurants are prepared to meet customer demand and expectations.,29,,
128,0.97,781.514,786.819,Partnered restaurants are also responsible for paying the Commission fee.,29,,
129,0.97,786.819,793.993,"For Nonpartnered restaurants, the food delivery platform's practice of listing these restaurants without their permission can cause a variety of issues.",29,,
130,0.97,793.993,798.597,One of the callers in public comment noted some of these challenges.,29,,
131,0.97,798.597,804.803,"For instance, they may be offering Take-Out or delivery from a restaurant that does not offer either of these options.",29,,
132,0.97,804.803,817.116,The most famous case being California there was a restaurant that was entirely closed due to Covid that found themselves on these delivery platforms much to their surprise.,29,,
133,0.97,817.116,824.089,Or offering delivery from restaurant that is only want to offer Take-Out directly to their customers to ensure the quality of the food.,29,,
134,0.97,824.089,827.526,"They also may provide inaccurate menus, as I note on the slide.",29,,
135,0.97,827.526,833.699,"The food delivery platforms are just Fulling information from the Internet, which may or may not be correct.",29,,
136,0.97,833.699,842.007,"And Additionally, restaurants may want--may not have an item available or want to limit what they are delivering or allowing to be delivered.",29,,
137,0.97,842.007,850.049,"Kind of recognizing that all food items do not travel well, such as French Fries being a primary example.",29,,
138,0.97,850.049,858.724,And listing restaurants that do not have capacity to meet demands of being listed on a food delivery platform.,29,,
139,0.97,858.724,866.031,A small restaurant used to catering to their neighborhood suddenly getting Areawide access is--can be overwhelming.,29,,
140,0.97,866.031,874.306,So sometimes these restaurants will only discover that they have been listed on a platform without their permission when delivery drivers appear to take orders.,29,,
141,0.97,874.306,884.016,"All of these issues can result in restaurants canceling orders, failing to provide what customers have ordered or excessively long delivery times.",29,,
142,0.97,884.016,889.755,"Again, as was noted during public comment, customers kind of assume that restaurants are on there with their permission.",29,,
143,0.97,889.755,894.493,They don't know that restaurants are being kind of Proactively added.,29,,
144,0.97,894.493,898.364,So they naturally blame the restaurants if there are issues.,29,,
145,0.97,898.364,913.779,And so that this can result in negative reviews which Harms the restaurant's reputation and then cause a loss of revenue because other customers are seeing these reviews and may avoid ordering from that restaurant.,29,,
146,0.97,913.779,923.889,"So to address this issue, the California state Legislature passed legislation last fall requiring that food delivery platforms attain the permission of restaurants prior to listing them.",29,,
147,0.97,923.889,932.031,This went into effect on January 1ST of this year.,29,,
148,0.97,932.031,935.868,Other States have explored other measures but none have thus far become law.,29,,
149,0.97,935.868,941.04,Anyone have any questions at this point?,29,,
150,0.97,941.04,945.244,So on to a summary of Council bill 120092.,29,,
151,0.97,945.244,959.291,This is modelled on the California law and other similar proposals in other States and would require food delivery platforms to establish a written agreement with any restaurant prior to offering Take-Out or delivery from that restaurant.,29,,
152,0.97,959.291,972.638,"Additionally, it would allow restaurants to terminate these agreements with a written request, and the food delivery platforms are then required to remove the restaurant from its listing within 72 hours of receiving such a request.",29,,
153,0.97,972.638,988.554,"It would also authorize the Department of finance and administrative services, also known as FAS, to impose a maximum fine of $250 per violation with each day of noncompliance counting as a separate violation.",29,,
154,0.97,988.554,1001.3,"The revenues Generateded from these penalties would be used to support restaurants of five or fewer employees, the office of economic development would provide recommendations in how these funds should be used.",29,,
155,0.97,1001.3,1012.611,Excite would also allow restaurants as individuals or a class to directly sue food delivery platforms in court for failing to adhere to the requirements of this legislation.,29,,
156,0.97,1012.611,1031.063,"Anticipating that this legislation would be passed by the Council this month, the effective date is delayed to September 15th of this year to provide restaurants and food delivery platforms with time to establish agreements prior to this legislation going into effect.",29,,
157,0.97,1031.063,1039.538,I will move through a few slides of the driving potential impacts of this legislation.,29,,
158,0.97,1039.538,1057.156,"Just given the fact that California is precedent at this point, would note that in response to the California law going into effect on January 1ST of this year tens of thousands of restaurants were removed from the delivery platforms.",29,,
159,0.97,1057.156,1057.99,This is statewide.,29,,
160,0.97,1057.99,1062.628,So we are currently not sure how many restaurants in Seattle have an agreement in place.,29,,
161,0.97,1062.628,1079.244,"Would just NOTE prior to the California law going into effect, one report estimated that only 16% of the 700,000 restaurants listed on Postmates had agreements in place when the legislation was signed into law last September.",29,,
162,0.97,1079.244,1090.756,"Given that only tens of thousands of restaurants were removed, it appears that there were a number of agreements that were put into place between September and January 1ST.",29,,
163,0.97,1090.756,1102.334,So my best guess is that passage of this legislation would likely result in hundreds of restaurants being removed from the platforms that are operating in Seattle after the effective date.,29,,
164,0.97,1102.334,1113.045,"I note on the slide that we have about 4,000 active business licenses in Seattle for restaurants, Caterers and other food industry businesses.",29,,
165,0.97,1113.045,1125.023,"So rough estimate of how many restaurants, there are fewer than that, and then I did a quick search on Grubhub the other day and it offered delivery from over 4,100 restaurants in the Seattle area.",29,,
166,0.97,1125.023,1132.831,"I'm not sure how expansive that is, but just to give you a sense of the scale here.",29,,
167,0.97,1132.831,1151.95,"Also, the legislation would require any Nonpartnered restaurant that wants to continue offering Take-Out or delivery through food delivery platforms to establish an agreement, which will result in the restaurant now being responsible for the Commission fee versus that being passed on to the customer.",29,,
168,0.97,1151.95,1161.593,"This will lower costs for the customers because now it's being charged to the restaurant and thus potentially increased demand, which may help to offset the additional cost.",29,,
169,0.97,1161.593,1170.569,"However, it's likely that some restaurants may go entirely for the financial impact.",29,,
170,0.97,1170.569,1180.479,"It's likely to benefit restaurants, as those who do not want to be listed on food delivery platforms no longer have to deal with the consequences that were described earlier.",29,,
171,0.97,1180.479,1198.497,"It's highly probable there will be fewer restaurant options to choose from for Custers with this legislation, but customers should have a better experience because they are only engaging with those restaurants that actually want to be listed on food delivery platforms.",29,,
172,0.97,1198.497,1216.615,"In terms of racial equity impacts, this Donut chart shows that about 48% of businesses in the food and accommodation services industry in the Seattle metropolitan area are owned by people who identify as black, indigenous or other people of color.",29,,
173,0.97,1216.615,1223.755,"More specifically, the largest share is Asian who represent 41% of business owners in this industry.",29,,
174,0.97,1223.755,1234.933,"Given that this legislation is intended to protect the interests of restaurant owners and their customers and look at these demographics, this proposal would promote racial equity.",29,,
175,0.97,1234.933,1253.952,"Additionally, revenues from penalties for violations of the new agreement requirement would be used to support restaurants with five or fewer employees on guidance from the economic element who would be Prioritizing investing any funds in an equitable manner.",29,,
176,0.97,1253.952,1262.361,"Also impacted by this legislation would be those who deliver the food to the customers from the restaurants, the delivery drivers.",29,,
177,0.97,1262.361,1275.34,"These are similar to those who work for Uber Uber independent contractors, not employees of the platform.",29,,
178,0.97,1275.34,1281.88,"These folks might be finding jobs via transportation network companies like Uber, grocery delivery services and other similar gig work.",29,,
179,0.97,1281.88,1288.654,We do not have good local data on these gig workers.,29,,
180,0.97,1288.654,1295.56,"The Bureau of labor Statistics describe the work they're engaged in as In-Person, electronically Mediated work.",29,,
181,0.97,1295.56,1301.733,I will just refer to this as gig work for our purposes.,29,,
182,0.97,1301.733,1309.975,"At the national level, gig workers are disproportionately black or African-American and slightly more likely to be Hispanic or Latino.",29,,
183,0.97,1309.975,1324.589,I would note that some recent news reports highlighted that during the pandemic more women have turned to food delivery work after either having lost their jobs or needing to quit their jobs because of loss of child care or the shift to remote schooling.,29,,
184,0.97,1324.589,1332.364,That flexibility has kind of been appealing to people looking to make money but also teach their kids at home.,29,,
185,0.97,1332.364,1347.412,"So by reducing the number of restaurants the food delivery platforms can list, this legislation could result in a decrease in the number of food delivery opportunities, though it's not really clear how great this impact could be.",29,,
186,0.97,1347.412,1361.626,"Assuming the national level of racial breakdown of these workers applies to Seattle area, job losses may be more likely to affect gig workers who are black or African-American, Hispanic/Latino, and potentially women.",29,,
187,0.97,1361.626,1375.807,"However, those jobs that do remain, the risk of conflict between delivery workers and restaurants should be decreased as any restaurant listed on delivery platforms would be a willing participant.",29,,
188,0.97,1375.807,1378.376,And just a quick review of the other impacts.,29,,
189,0.97,1378.376,1389.855,"Just noting the need for outreach and engagement to restaurant owners to increase the awareness of any regulation, would expect that.",29,,
190,0.97,1389.855,1405.47,"The Office of economic development, perhaps others may need additional resources to engage with owners and provide technical services to execute agreements with delivery platforms prior to that September 1ST--September 15th effective date.",29,,
191,0.97,1405.47,1415.847,"Additionally, the Department of finance and administrative services would be required to levy penalties on any food delivery platform found to be in violation of the requirements.",29,,
192,0.97,1415.847,1428.26,"Based on the experience in California, the platforms have been largely Compliant, so I go not expect that this would create a capacity issue for FAS.",29,,
193,0.97,1428.26,1437.502,"But also then with a few fines, there's less revenue from penalties, should they be Compliant, which would be the goal.",29,,
194,0.97,1437.502,1454.452,"And finally, this legislation would establish a private right of action so that restaurants as individuals or as a class may sue food delivery platforms for damages if they fail to comply with the requirements of this legislation.",29,,
195,0.97,1454.452,1460.192,That was an overview of the legislation.,29,,
196,0.97,1460.192,1462.027,Happy to answer any questions.,29,,
197,0.97,1462.027,1473.839,"Colleagues, any questions for Yolanda about what this bill is proposing to do?",30,,
198,0.97,1473.839,1478.91,I have a question.,30,,
199,0.97,1478.91,1490.755,"So the requirement here is that there are already written agreements that the vendors have, the platforms have, with some businesses.",30,,
200,0.97,1490.755,1497.963,"How do we know that the new businesses would have these written agreements, and do we have copies of that?",30,,
201,0.97,1497.963,1503.468,Can you talk a little bit about how the enforcement piece of this would work.,30,,
202,0.97,1503.468,1505.537,How do we know?,30,,
203,0.97,1505.537,1508.34,"So it would be Complaint-Based, right.",31,,
204,0.97,1508.34,1520.252,"So if a restaurant does not have a written agreement, that is between the restaurant and the delivery platform to have that contractual agreement.",31,,
205,0.97,1520.252,1546.211,"But should a restaurant, after the September 15th effective date, see itself listed on, let's say, any of the food delivery platforms, and they do not have a contract, what they would do is, you know, take a Screenshot, whatever, time stamp it and provide it to FAS, and say, Hey, they are not abiding by your requirement here.",31,,
206,0.97,1546.211,1547.279,"Okay, thank you.",32,,
207,0.97,1547.279,1553.785,I don't see any hands in the raise hand function.,32,,
208,0.97,1553.785,1556.087,"So Council President Gonzalez, I'll hand it back to you.",32,,
209,0.97,1556.087,1558.056,"Great, thank you so much, chair.",33,,
210,0.97,1558.056,1568.9,"First of all, I just want to say thank you chair Morales for making time in your busy committee schedule to allow for us to consider this important piece of legislation.",33,,
211,0.97,1568.9,1583.448,The fair food delivery bill or Council bill 120092 will help restaurants by ensuring the presence on the delivery platform is in their hands and they continue to own the guest experience from beginning to end.,33,,
212,0.97,1583.448,1586.851,"The guest experience for many restaurants is really, really important.",33,,
213,0.97,1586.851,1592.958,We heard a little bit of that during public testimony this afternoon.,33,,
214,0.97,1592.958,1599.13,"But you know, restaurants work really hard to build and to execute that guest experience.",33,,
215,0.97,1599.13,1622.954,"And when restaurants are unwilling participants in these delivery platforms, it just creates a lot of opportunity for bad customer experience but also for really negative experiences for delivery drivers as well, who are sort of left in sort of this in between negotiating role between the restaurant and the customer.",33,,
216,0.97,1622.954,1630.095,And we want to eliminate that negative experience both for the delivery driver but also for the customer and also for the restaurant.,33,,
217,0.97,1630.095,1642.741,"So it's my hope that this bill will allow delivery drivers to just focus on what their function is, which is the basic delivery of food.",33,,
218,0.97,1642.741,1650.715,"When a restaurant isn't a willing participant and there may be an old, out of date menu Online, it just creates havoc.",33,,
219,0.97,1650.715,1656.421,"You know, we've heard recent examples here locally of those issues happening.",33,,
220,0.97,1656.421,1664.696,"Everything from cafe Racer, who was closed down, but Uber eats took orders for months for that cafe.",33,,
221,0.97,1664.696,1681.446,The Deli made a very public comment recently similarly expressing much frustration with out of order menus and not knowing that those out of order--out of date menus were placed on a platform.,33,,
222,0.97,1681.446,1685.683,And then lark is another recent example that was publicly written about.,33,,
223,0.97,1685.683,1702.467,"Lark in this instance doesn't even offer delivery or Take-Out via the third party delivery Apps, and Nonetheless, their menu appeared on a delivery App, creating, again, a lot of confusion both for the customer and the restaurant and the delivery driver.",33,,
224,0.97,1702.467,1708.039,So this bill will address all of those particular situations.,33,,
225,0.97,1708.039,1720.885,And I think it's really important also to emphasize the significance of this bill as it relates to the impact on drivers who have little or no protections or benefits in this space.,33,,
226,0.97,1720.885,1734.165,So this is going to be a really important bill to make sure that drivers aren't having to go above and beyond to avoid a negative review on their delivery.,33,,
227,0.97,1734.165,1747.846,"For any of us who have used a third party platform, a lot of times you'll get a text survey and they ask you questions specifically about your experience with the food delivery driver.",33,,
228,0.97,1747.846,1777.008,"And you know, sort of this legislation allows for, you know, sort of maximizing good reviews of the delivery driver if, in fact, the restaurant is a voluntary participant and we are allowing the opportunity for the driver to have to also order your food for you in order to avoid the negative consequences of a bad review if you as a customer don't get what you thought you ordered from the restaurant that you thought you were able to order from.",33,,
229,0.97,1777.008,1785.85,So there are businesses across the city sharing similar issues and experiences with these delivery platforms with my office.,33,,
230,0.97,1785.85,1793.224,"Some of those include bang bang cafe, simply soulful and many others.",33,,
231,0.97,1793.224,1802.2,"My office has engaged with working Washington, teamsters, hospitality groups like Seattle restaurants United.",33,,
232,0.97,1802.2,1824.489,"We've engaged with delivery platforms directly, and we've heard directly from other restaurants, all of whom have expressed really broad support for the bill, which is intentionally narrow in focus to ensure restaurants are willing participants in the delivery food business that is now very, very common place.",33,,
233,0.97,1824.489,1839.204,"So I hope this bill will help improve and streamline the process of ordering for customers, keeping an up-to-date menu for restaurants, and it will allow drivers to focus on Pickups and deliveries.",33,,
234,0.97,1839.204,1846.277,This is pretty straight forward piece of legislation and excited about having it move forward through the legislative process.,33,,
235,0.97,1846.277,1858.59,Last I just want to thank my senior policy advisor and the fabulous Yolanda from our Council central staff for their really solid policy work on the fair food delivery legislation.,33,,
236,0.97,1858.59,1866.998,"And with that, Madame chair, I would urge members of the economic development committee to vote yes on this bill.",33,,
237,0.97,1866.998,1870.001,"Thank you very much, Council President.",34,,
238,0.97,1870.001,1872.537,"And thank you, Yolanda, for walking us through that.",34,,
239,0.97,1872.537,1887.352,"I do not see any hands raised from our colleagues, so with that, colleagues, I move that the committee recommends passage on Council bill 120092, is there a second?",34,,
240,0.97,1887.352,1887.685,Second.,35,,

257,0.97,1935.4,1935.933,No worries.,48,,

260,0.97,1937.535,1947.378,"Okay, so the motion carries and the committee recommendation that the bill pass will be sent to the June 14th full city council meeting.",49,,

301,0.97,2111.209,2118.483,"So, Councilmembers, my name is Reese Tanimura.",64,,
302,0.97,2118.483,2122.253,My pronouns are She/Her and They/Them.,64,,
303,0.97,2122.253,2129.727,"Just like to talk a little bit about what we've been doing the past few years, but especially in the past year.",64,,
304,0.97,2129.727,2144.575,"As you know, for many folks but particularly for the arts and cultural sectors and creative industries have had a pretty hard 2020.",64,,
305,0.97,2144.575,2156.02,"The music Commission, you know, alongside our fellow bodies and our adjoined offices have been really engaged in artist advocacy.",64,,
306,0.97,2156.02,2178.709,"We know that our artists were some of the first to lose their livelihoods right from the outset of the Stay-At-Home orders and have continued to be challenged to find work through now and even, you know, will continue until some of the Venues and things start to open up again.",64,,
307,0.97,2178.709,2194.358,So advocacy both on the level of professional development and ways to get into more of a Digital realm as well as finding ways to bolster our support for gig workers.,64,,
308,0.97,2194.358,2206.103,And another piece of our work has been largely involved in cultural space and Venue rescue and hopefully intervention and the loss of that.,64,,
309,0.97,2206.103,2222.72,"We've been very involved in the work on the cultural space agency, PDA and--or continuing conversations about continued losses or interruption of losses for Venue spaces and cultural spaces.",64,,
310,0.97,2222.72,2233.097,"As you know, that as following during this time the next concern will be disaster, displacement and Gentrification.",64,,
311,0.97,2233.097,2249.513,"So that's very on our awareness, and worked with a couple of you Councilmembers on Digital equity this year for our young people and for artists who relied heavily on--or sometimes up couldn't rely very heavily on the method that we are all gathering here today on.",64,,
312,0.97,2249.513,2253.384,So those are some bigger topics that we've been involved in.,64,,
313,0.97,2253.384,2285.883,"The other piece of that is, you know, providing work force development to make sure that we continue to be on the front edge of the emerging economy and industries, the creative and cultural industries, and really working with our city departments and all of our partners to leverage arts and culture as essential work force and essential parts of our economy and society.",64,,
