365,0.97,2007.739,2011.209,"With the ever-changing news about Covid-19, our forecast has also changed over the last 18 months or so.",59,,
366,0.97,2011.209,2015.446,"We are looking forward to hearing, right now, about how Covid and our local economy has affected our projected revenues.",59,,
367,0.97,2015.446,2023.621,"As a reminder, due to the good work by the Council President, by her office and central staff's team including Allie Canoochee, Dan Eater, as well as folks from CBO and our office, we will have a different process next year.",59,,
368,0.97,2023.621,2035.867,This will be a process that is more transparent and will allow us to see the forecast for projecting the possible revenue available for balancing and budgeting practices.,59,,
369,0.97,2035.867,2047.145,"After having a brief chance to review the presentation that was published yesterday, I know there are probably many questions that folks had.",60,,
370,0.97,2047.145,2050.114,We want to make sure we get a chance to go into those questions.,60,,
371,0.97,2050.114,2052.25,"And director noble, we have a handful of folks with us.",60,,

381,0.97,2090.421,2091.689,"Good morning, Madam chair.",61,,
382,0.97,2091.689,2093.024,I am Tom Mikesell from central staff.,61,,
383,0.97,2093.024,2112.944,I would just like to add to your thorough description for where we are with the revenue forecast in the city that this is the second of the committee forecasts we will be receiving from the committee budget office this year with the next one coming during councils budget deliberations in November.,61,,
384,0.97,2112.944,2120.918,That is the final update for this year for both 2021 fiscal year and for the 2022 budget year.,61,,
385,0.97,2120.918,2123.988,That will be Deliberated in the fall.,61,,
386,0.97,2123.988,2148.146,We have adjusted this year's fall budget calendar to make sure that we built in enough time for the revenue forecast to be both presented and for us to have it be digested in case there are additional changes folks might want to see.,62,,
387,0.97,2148.146,2149.68,We are going to discuss the supplemental.,62,,
388,0.97,2149.68,2151.415,It would be nice to have this information in advance.,62,,
389,0.97,2151.415,2154.252,It is part of the process we are working towards to Billback that information.,62,,
390,0.97,2154.252,2155.92,We do appreciate the Minder--reminder.,62,,
391,0.97,2155.92,2162.76,We appreciate director noble's appreciation to give us the most recent information as soon as you got it--we appreciate you being there.,62,,
392,0.97,2162.76,2163.227,Anything else?,62,,
393,0.97,2163.227,2170.101,"No, I just don't know if you want to round Robin through the folks who will be presenting today.",63,,
394,0.97,2170.101,2177.975,I could hand off to Dan Eater in [Indiscernible],63,,
395,0.97,2177.975,2183.881,"Sure, let's do that as we tee up the presentation.",64,,
396,0.97,2183.881,2188.119,"Thank you, Tom, I am with central staff but I don't have anything to add to the introductory remarks.",65,,
397,0.97,2188.119,2188.519,Thank you.,65,,
398,0.97,2188.519,2194.592,You want to Popcorn it?,66,,
399,0.97,2194.592,2196.427,"This is noble, the city budget director, Dave?",67,,
400,0.97,2196.427,2200.765,I am Dave Hanis with the city budget office and revenue team.,68,,
401,0.97,2200.765,2207.204,And most of the presentation today will be done by yonder us who is economic forecasting.,68,,
402,0.97,2207.204,2211.008,So turn it over to him.,68,,
403,0.97,2211.008,2251.315,"I am [Indiscernible]. Let me make a couple comments before yon says--this is the second of the forecast--the thing important to note is that this is the forecast to which the proposed budget will be balanced, so we are in the throes of putting together budget decisions on the executive side in preparation for delivering the proposed 22 budget late in September to begin Council delivered at process--again, as Tom mentioned, there will be an update to the forecast provided in November.",69,,
404,0.97,2251.315,2257.788,-- or late October depending on the calendar.,69,,
405,0.97,2257.788,2274.705,"One thing I just added before diving in is, obviously, this has been a challenging time to do revenue forecasting as described previously, we are both tracking the underlying data with employment and income.",69,,
406,0.97,2274.705,2276.073,A lot of that was explained.,69,,
407,0.97,2276.073,2285.983,"But the obvious factor is Covid- 19 and the Pandemics impacts on the economy which have been evolving, and basically are going to be continuing to evolve.",69,,
408,0.97,2285.983,2289.487,So we will talk a bunch about that today.,69,,
409,0.97,2289.487,2297.395,The thing I would add as well is that the level of uncertainty about revenues in the context of Covid Israel.,69,,
410,0.97,2297.395,2297.662,Right?,69,,
411,0.97,2297.662,2303.1,We have seen the forecast move up and down over the past year and a half plus.,69,,
412,0.97,2303.1,2320.484,In addition to one of the strategies--is not only trying to get the revenue right and dealing with uncertainty but also how to adopt a budget and spending plan to the uncertainty.,69,,
413,0.97,2320.484,2341.872,"And in particular, proposing--avoiding significant increases in long-term commitments for ongoing expenses in a world we don't know whether our revenues will be as steady and reliable as we wanted in the long term, so wanted to assure you if we are building a budget we are conscious of that fact.",69,,
414,0.97,2341.872,2347.178,"Whatever our forecast is, it is a degree of uncertainty that is higher than normal.",69,,
415,0.97,2347.178,2356.387,"If there needs to be adjustments in a downward direction because of changes that evolved, we need to look like it's prepared for that reality.",69,,
416,0.97,2356.387,2362.893,"It could, for instance, involved restoring some of our reserves.",69,,
417,0.97,2362.893,2369.1,We have depleted those over the past two years in an appropriate way to maintain city services through this difficult period.,69,,
418,0.97,2369.1,2389.42,You can ultimately see that in today's forecast . directing a portion of that to reserves as we develop the budget would be an example of how to use the forecast resource in a way that is flexible and recognizes the be realized.,69,,
419,0.97,2389.42,2391.689,So I will say more about that as we go.,69,,
420,0.97,2391.689,2394.558,I wanted to relay some of the groundwork as you see what is coming.,69,,
421,0.97,2394.558,2397.194,Let me turn it over to Dave and Jan to get into the substance.,69,,
422,0.97,2397.194,2401.198,"Just get started, Jan.",70,,
423,0.97,2401.198,2407.104,If we can get the presentation --,71,,
424,0.97,2407.104,2411.809,Do we need to do that or are you managing the presentation?,72,,
425,0.97,2411.809,2414.211,I thought you all were.,73,,
426,0.97,2414.211,2416.647,[Indiscernible],74,,
427,0.97,2416.647,2419.717,I can put it up.,75,,
428,0.97,2419.717,2423.721,Just give me one second.,75,,
429,0.97,2423.721,2432.93,"Thank you, director noble.",76,,
430,0.97,2432.93,2442.44,I just need to take us back to the first slide rather than the last slide.,77,,
431,0.97,2442.44,2443.641,You give away all the news.,78,,
432,0.97,2443.641,2444.241,Exactly.,79,,
433,0.97,2444.241,2446.076,"I'm just going to do it this way, okay?",79,,
434,0.97,2446.076,2448.345,So--trying to get to full screen --,79,,
435,0.97,2448.345,2449.947,This will work.,80,,
436,0.97,2449.947,2453.984,Control L.,81,,
437,0.97,2453.984,2456.253,All right.,82,,
438,0.97,2456.253,2457.855,Let's go.,82,,
439,0.97,2457.855,2459.29,Maybe--there we go.,83,,
440,0.97,2459.29,2462.56,All right.,83,,
441,0.97,2462.56,2469.467,So first--so we are going to start with the National regional economic update and moved to revenues themselves.,83,,
442,0.97,2469.467,2475.439,So here is the first of the slides summarizing economic changes.,83,,
443,0.97,2475.439,2475.706,Jan?,83,,
444,0.97,2475.706,2489.587,"All right, so the first slide summarizes what happened in the first half of 2021 and compares it to what was expected when we were presenting the April forecast.",84,,
445,0.97,2489.587,2500.698,"The charge shows the forecast error, so the difference between the actual and the predicted in terms of income, outlays, and sales.",84,,
446,0.97,2500.698,2509.64,"As you can see, there wasn't too much of the forecast there for employment.",84,,
447,0.97,2509.64,2515.746,"It was getting really close to what was predicted, overall income for the first half of 2021 was quite close to what was predicted.",84,,
448,0.97,2515.746,2529.86,The biggest forecast error in the IHS forecast was for personal outlays and retail sales which are driving sales tax revenue and the BNO tax revenue.,84,,
449,0.97,2529.86,2542.373,The massive physical stimulus field consumer demand and had a larger increase in consumer spending in the first half than was expected.,84,,
450,0.97,2542.373,2556.253,Personal outlays were about 4% above the best scenario retail sales were about 8.5% above the best [Indiscernible] scenario.,84,,
451,0.97,2556.253,2562.459,That was what we used as a starting point to develop our revenue forecast in April.,84,,
452,0.97,2562.459,2575.873,"As you can see, even the baseline scenario was, in a sense much lower compared to what the Actuals were.",84,,
453,0.97,2575.873,2581.579,"Regardless of whether we are with the baseline scenario or estimate scenario for March, the actual outperformed significantly.",84,,
454,0.97,2581.579,2594.792,"That is relevant because, again, those are the two important factors that determine the local revenue sales tax revenue and the BNO revenue.",84,,
455,0.97,2594.792,2618.749,"And with these kind of significant forecast error outperforming the predictions, you can expect there would be a large tradition for 2021 forecast when Dhi s is incorporating these extra spending, and it's going to feed into a higher revenue forecast we will show later on.",84,,
456,0.97,2618.749,2621.018,"Next slide, please.",84,,
457,0.97,2621.018,2627.925,"Now while the consumer demand has been recovering much better than expected, employment was on track.",84,,
458,0.97,2627.925,2632.363,There is still a way to go.,84,,
459,0.97,2632.363,2649.246,"Local economy is still 4.8% below its employment in February 2020, it is comparable to the national economy so the overall trend for employment recovery is similar for national and regional economy.",84,,
460,0.97,2649.246,2650.447,"Again, it is lower than demand.",84,,
461,0.97,2650.447,2651.849,"Next slide, please?",84,,
462,0.97,2651.849,2662.159,"I'm sorry, Councilmember Lewis, on the last slide, slide number four?",85,,
463,0.97,2662.159,2663.26,Thank you Madam chair.,86,,
464,0.97,2663.26,2670.768,"Just briefly because I know we are pressed for time, what do we attribute the slow employment recovery too?",86,,
465,0.97,2670.768,2676.206,"We will get to that in a second, if you can wait two more slides lady--then we will --",87,,
466,0.97,2676.206,2681.111,Your anticipation Resents well.,88,,
467,0.97,2681.111,2686.85,So employment recovery is not as fast as recovery in demand.,89,,
468,0.97,2686.85,2696.427,"How there are several factors behind that, the number of openings is not the the problem.",89,,
469,0.97,2696.427,2708.305,The number of opening exceeds the unemployed people.,89,,
470,0.97,2708.772,2709.54,Job openings are high.,89,,
471,0.97,2709.54,2714.812,"Wages are growing as you can see compared to February 2020, the wages in the private sector rose by 8%.",89,,
472,0.97,2714.812,2724.755,"Some of the industries like retail trade, hospitality, they saw an increase in wages of 10%.",89,,
473,0.97,2724.755,2729.259,Those wages are increasing to attract more employees.,89,,
474,0.97,2729.259,2738.368,It seems to be more on the side of the availability of workers.,89,,
475,0.97,2738.368,2741.038,"Again, there are several extras for that.",89,,
476,0.97,2741.038,2743.373,This is between skills and locations.,89,,
477,0.97,2743.373,2748.545,Some employees have moved.,89,,
478,0.97,2748.545,2759.356,Some changed their preference and they are no longer looking for a job in leisure and hospitality because they consider it to be too risky.,89,,
479,0.97,2759.356,2764.261,Even higher wages are still not attractive enough.,89,,
480,0.97,2764.261,2770.2,Long-term people are considering switching careers completely.,89,,
481,0.97,2770.2,2778.375,"There is a problem with low labor force participation as many people have retired early, and they are not really returning back to work.",89,,
482,0.97,2778.375,2785.349,Laborforce participation is low because of some problems with Childcare for some individuals.,89,,
483,0.97,2785.349,2813.343,"And other contributing factors that slows down the employment recovery, the extended edifice which some would argue are getting workers more time to choose what sort of a job fits their needs, fits their skills, fits their long-term career plans better.",89,,
484,0.97,2813.343,2822.252,"So there is a bunch of factors, each contributing to some extent causing the employment--there are people in recovery slower than recovery in demand.",89,,
485,0.97,2822.252,2846.977,"That said, in the regional economy, we have seen quite a significant increase in the number of jobs as you can see in the chart, the total number of jobs increased by 70,000 between February and June, so since we have last presented our forecast, a large part has been increased in the leisure and hospitality sector.",89,,
486,0.97,2846.977,2857.254,[Indiscernible] segment--that is pretty much as it was.,89,,
487,0.97,2857.254,2863.493,[Indiscernible] recovery there.,89,,
488,0.97,2863.493,2868.565,"Before we move off of this slide, I want to double back to Council member Louis and see if the question was answered.",90,,
489,0.97,2868.565,2883.614,"When I was looking at slide 4, I wanted to have better understanding of what the impact was of slower economic recovery, and slide six talks about the why.",90,,
490,0.97,2883.614,2888.885,"I'm looking to get a better sense of how that affects us, what is the short and long-term impacts of the data you're showing right now?",90,,
491,0.97,2888.885,2891.321,"Council member Louis, if you have anything to add your question, feel free.",90,,
492,0.97,2891.321,2892.389,My question was answered.,91,,
493,0.97,2892.389,2897.995,Thank you Madam chair.,91,,
494,0.97,2897.995,2903.1,Okay.,92,,
495,0.97,2903.1,2903.934,Anything else to add?,92,,
496,0.97,2903.934,2905.135,Anything else to add?,93,,
497,0.97,2905.135,2927.724,"Yeah, implement recovery was far expected to take longer than recovery in let's say GDP or personal outlays, and the development in the first half of 2021 were consumer demands--really fueled by the stimulus increased much further than expected, but moved the recurring consumer demand further forward.",93,,
498,0.97,2927.724,2930.994,The implement is kind of on track.,93,,
499,0.97,2930.994,2967.698,"Dhi s and regional forecast are expecting [Indiscernible], but taking longer because labor market is much more complicated matching jobs and the workers matching [Indiscernible] the market takes much longer because people moving, changing their preferences long-term effect changes in the labor force, just a lot of things that happen that are exacerbated by the pandemic hitting the already ongoing [Indiscernible].",93,,
500,0.97,2967.698,2970.367,If you don't mind speaking up just a little!,94,,
501,0.97,2970.367,2972.202,It is a little quiet on your end!,94,,
502,0.97,2972.202,2975.038,That is wonderful.,94,,
503,0.97,2975.038,2981.378,"Dave, did you have anything else on that?",94,,
504,0.97,2981.378,2987.084,If we look at the actual revenue numbers you will see a difference between 21 growth and 22.,95,,
505,0.97,2987.084,2988.819,It starts to moderate out a little bit.,95,,
506,0.97,2988.819,2993.29,21 is large blip driven by the stimulus--some --,95,,
507,0.97,2993.29,2996.159,I think that's what you will see.,96,,
508,0.97,2996.159,3011.675,Slowness in employment restoration is one of the reasons the recovery we are experiencing a significant bump in the stimulus is Langley--likely to take a longer period overall.,96,,
509,0.97,3011.675,3023.954,Let's talk about impacts of employment and the changing nature of employment affecting other aspects of the economy and indirectly our revenues.,96,,
510,0.97,3023.954,3024.421,Exactly.,97,,
511,0.97,3024.421,3035.532,So it is important how many people work for the revenue forecast.,97,,
512,0.97,3035.532,3037.567,"It is quite crucial, of course, where exactly they work.",97,,
513,0.97,3037.567,3044.074,There have been quite dramatic changes over last year in terms of that.,97,,
514,0.97,3044.074,3050.847,"But there has been this recovery in the consumer demand and recently, a number of research in Seattle has recovered the blue line in the chart.",97,,
515,0.97,3050.847,3053.85,"In presence of office workers, it is still quite low.",97,,
516,0.97,3053.85,3065.896,Companies have recently postponed or returned to office for several more months because of the rising number of Covid cases.,97,,
517,0.97,3065.896,3088.385,"The workers that come to downtown, they not only spend money on services within downtown, the overall number of office workers also drives the construction sector.",97,,
518,0.97,3088.385,3104.601,The demand for office space is going to the play an important role in the construction sector which is one of the important sources of sales [Indiscernible]--I can see there's a question.,97,,
519,0.97,3104.601,3106.203,"Madam chair, may I ask a question?",98,,
520,0.97,3106.203,3107.237,"Okay, thank you.",98,,
521,0.97,3107.237,3116.012,I just have some sort of--there is quite a bit of jargon on here.,98,,
522,0.97,3116.012,3118.215,I want to make sure I understand what I'm looking at.,98,,
523,0.97,3118.215,3132.229,"If you can help me break this down a little bit, on this, on the left side of the slide where it has the chart, 2021, quarter two.",98,,
524,0.97,3132.229,3145.842,"U.s., that is the number at 12.1% is a national number, and 12.1% represents what?",98,,
525,0.97,3145.842,3160.29,So it is releasing data on how much office space there is in square feet and how much of that is available either directly or through sublease.,99,,
526,0.97,3160.29,3162.993,"So nationally, the vacancy rate is 12.1%?",100,,
527,0.97,3162.993,3165.896,It was in 2019.,101,,
528,0.97,3165.896,3171.067,It has gone up to 16.5% as of last quarter.,101,,
529,0.97,3171.067,3172.068,As of last quarter?,102,,
530,0.97,3172.068,3175.105,"Okay, super helpful.",102,,
531,0.97,3175.105,3181.077,"And Seattle Cbd, what is the difference between Cbd and downtown?",102,,
532,0.97,3181.077,3185.282,Downtown is a little bigger area.,103,,
533,0.97,3185.282,3187.083,Cbd is central business district.,103,,
534,0.97,3187.083,3190.32,Downtown [Indiscernible].,103,,
535,0.97,3190.32,3198.094,So give me an example of Seattle central business district.,104,,
536,0.97,3198.094,3225.055,"Central business district is essentially the area abound by--not exactly sure how much it stretches out, but [Indiscernible] square is not included--South Lake Union as part of downtown but I believe it is part of central business district--you can [Indiscernible] with that.",105,,
537,0.97,3225.055,3226.122,That would be great.,106,,
538,0.97,3226.122,3237.934,"If we can get this aggregation, a better understanding of what is included in Cbd and downtown, that would be helpful to me.",106,,
539,0.97,3237.934,3261.658,"And then,--and--in terms of--in terms of the other Comparables cities to Seattle, have you all done any analysis on how these numbers trend?",106,,
540,0.97,3261.658,3262.259,Are we faring better?,106,,
541,0.97,3262.259,3263.26,Are we faring the same?,106,,
542,0.97,3263.26,3264.26,Are we faring worse?,106,,
543,0.97,3264.26,3267.364,What is your sense of that in terms of how we compare to other cities?,106,,
544,0.97,3267.364,3290.086,"If we can go back to the first part, [Indiscernible], the Triangle is not--not part of Cbd, but are part of downtown.",107,,
545,0.97,3290.086,3290.487,Okay.,108,,
546,0.97,3290.487,3295.392,"In terms of how Seattle compares to a national level, that is the first two lines.",109,,
547,0.97,3295.392,3301.431,"There, the last lines in the table compare Seattle to the other parts of the region.",109,,
548,0.97,3301.431,3309.205,Our regional forecast is for pink and Snohomish counties.,109,,
549,0.97,3309.205,3322.385,"So those last lines on the table are trying to compare Seattle Cbd, [Indiscernible], and to East side overall where we are in terms of the vacancies right now.",109,,
550,0.97,3322.385,3356.086,"Yeah, I think what I'm trying to get a sense of--you know, I have been following some of the reporting that has been done by the economist and more global economic thinking agencies and news agencies in particular, and a lot of folks are speculating that our Office- based workforce is effectively going to be forever changed.",110,,
551,0.97,3356.086,3371.167,"In other words, it would be a mistake for cities to bank on a 100% Pre-Covid model of office space and downtown work models.",110,,
552,0.97,3371.167,3403.867,"I want to get a sense from you all in the CBO office about sort of what you're thinking is around that and how that really will impact the city's view on downtown Seattle recovery, but in some of these, you know, other business districts as well that have high concentrations of office space that continues to experience higher than usual vacancy rates.",110,,
553,0.97,3403.867,3407.103,All right.,111,,
554,0.97,3407.103,3424.154,"Going forward, we can compare more broadly to the U.S. there is the slide regarding office demand index which is more Forward-Looking instead of looking at current vacancies and trying to look at the future.",111,,
555,0.97,3424.154,3426.823,What might happen in the near term?,111,,
556,0.97,3426.823,3452.615,It is an office indexer that Dps Constructs based on how many businesses are interested in touring the available office spaces either directly or through some sort of Online presentations . The office demand index for Seattle is 71%.,111,,
557,0.97,3452.615,3460.089,"I will compare it to the 2018 or 2019 average, so 30% down for U.S., it is currently slightly more.",111,,
558,0.97,3460.089,3468.398,It is slightly comparable with San Francisco and Boston which are also somewhere around 70%.,111,,
559,0.97,3468.398,3486.282,"It has been argued that for Seattle and San Francisco, and a large part of the workforce, it is more adaptable to work from home.",111,,
560,0.97,3486.282,3505.401,"Because of that, there are still companies figuring out how much office space they really need, how much they can switch to some kind of hybrid model, or workers who can spend a significant fraction working from home.",111,,
561,0.97,3505.401,3510.039,"Because of that, they might need less office space [Indiscernible].",111,,
562,0.97,3510.039,3511.507,It is a question of timing.,112,,
563,0.97,3511.507,3513.71,"In this forecast, we are talking about 21 and 22.",112,,
564,0.97,3513.71,3525.154,We are not building in a large factor for a change in the way Americans work in terms of urban centers versus suburban areas.,112,,
565,0.97,3525.154,3533.229,It is something we are definitely conscious of because it can strongly affect Dno revenues and the expense tax.,112,,
566,0.97,3533.229,3540.937,So we have been talking about this a fair amount but we don't have any answers about the actual timing of how this will play out.,112,,
567,0.97,3540.937,3545.842,It is a business decision of what they plan to do with their workforce.,112,,
568,0.97,3545.842,3551.281,But Seattle is prone to it because we do have a high degree of workers who can work from home.,112,,
569,0.97,3551.281,3552.682,So we will definitely be watching it.,112,,
570,0.97,3552.682,3570.366,"I don't think we have any, you know, kind of crystal ball that is telling us, Yeah, here is the growth rate of the phenomenon, you know, how it's exactly going to play out.",112,,
571,0.97,3570.366,3571.0,I appreciate that.,113,,
572,0.97,3571.0,3572.602,I appreciate your tracking and following it.,113,,
573,0.97,3572.602,3602.298,"That is the crux of my question because I believe this is an important evolution in how our work force and where our workforce works that really does have a significant impact on revenue but also presents a lot of opportunity in terms of thinking about--you know, how we change, you know, the growth and development of our city to fit the new model of how Americans are working.",113,,
574,0.97,3602.298,3620.583,"You see this happening in a lot of European cities where unemployment centers are wholly concentrated on one urban core, but more equitably distributed throughout cities to allow for employment centers to exist in the same place where people are currently living.",113,,
575,0.97,3620.583,3665.461,"A smaller Footprint overall in terms of office space, but it certainly seems that that might be the direction we are heading in and I want us as a city to be ready for the potential and to be able to pivot in that direction to ensure that we are still creating office space that makes sense for how our office workforce is evolving and will continue to evolve now that we have all endured and are continuing to endure the longest pilot project ever of Telework and zoom calls, so I think that is important for us to keep a pulse on.",113,,
576,0.97,3665.461,3667.897,And your analysis would be useful in making policy determinations down the road.,113,,
577,0.97,3667.897,3668.698,Thank you Madam chair.,113,,
578,0.97,3668.698,3672.168,Council member Lewis to follow up on that?,114,,
579,0.97,3672.168,3672.969,Thank you Madam chair.,115,,
580,0.97,3672.969,3677.206,I wanted to ask a few more questions on the Bts.,115,,
581,0.97,3677.206,3679.675,Did I hear there was going to be another slide on that?,115,,
582,0.97,3679.675,3680.877,Am I jumping the gun again?,115,,
583,0.97,3680.877,3686.182,"On Bts, no.",116,,
584,0.97,3686.182,3686.449,Okay.,117,,
585,0.97,3686.449,3691.688,I want to ask about clarification with Bts data presented on the slide.,117,,
586,0.97,3691.688,3711.908,There was some reporting by the Seattle times in the spring about Seattle's recovery with Bts metric being rather high and a wrong number coming in at 107 on the index.,117,,
587,0.97,3711.908,3715.211,"At that point, it was 18.5% higher than the average index score in the Pre-Pandemic period.",117,,
588,0.97,3715.211,3719.715,"This was reported by the Fyi guy, Seattle times.",117,,
589,0.97,3719.715,3731.461,"You know, at that time the only other Metro area that was posting higher aggregate demand than Bts was Washington, D.C.",117,,
590,0.97,3731.461,3742.238,So I'm wondering how it is reported here with the June number rather than the March one.,117,,
591,0.97,3742.238,3761.257,"The way it is presented on the slide as well as the 2019 average, I guess my question would be, did we take another dip between March and June, and how do we sort of look in terms of the recovery and demand based on the previous reporting?",117,,
592,0.97,3761.257,3778.107,"It seems like the way it is presented here, office space demand is not doing as well as the national average, but that seems to be in contrast to have the times reported on this in the spring.",117,,
593,0.97,3778.107,3778.574,I'm curious --,117,,
594,0.97,3778.574,3779.208,All right.,118,,
595,0.97,3779.208,3779.809,All right.,118,,
596,0.97,3779.809,3780.409,Let me clarify this.,118,,
597,0.97,3780.409,3791.42,"Yes, first of all, there was a doctorate between March and June for Seattle for Washington, D.C. those are two of the Metros that saw a decline in demand.",118,,
598,0.97,3791.42,3797.493,"The other was Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles, Boston and San Francisco.",118,,
599,0.97,3797.493,3799.762,"Those Metros, there was an increase in demand for office space.",118,,
600,0.97,3799.762,3808.437,"But Seattle, there was a drop.",118,,
601,0.97,3808.437,3809.305,"Still, the index is volatile.",118,,
602,0.97,3809.305,3810.106,It changes significantly.,118,,
603,0.97,3810.106,3812.308,It doesn't mean there is a change in the trend.,118,,
604,0.97,3812.308,3815.545,We will be seeing decline.,118,,
605,0.97,3815.545,3836.666,"There will certainly be a drop in demand after we have seen that the hospital you are referring was essentially [Indiscernible] quite a significant recovery for Seattle, but part of that, [Indiscernible] demand for office space declined slightly.",118,,
606,0.97,3836.666,3853.449,"I'm not 100% sure what the number you are referring to was about, but whether it was change between the lowest.",118,,
607,0.97,3858.321,3880.176,"As of now, there was a 71 drop percent comparable [Indiscernible] to Boston, comparable to San Francisco, worse than New York City for example which has recovered completely for [Indiscernible] Los Angeles that has recovered completely.",118,,
608,0.97,3880.176,3885.514,"Councilmember Lewis, is that something you would like us to follow up on--what is following that article versus --",119,,
609,0.97,3885.514,3887.483,That would be helpful.,120,,
610,0.97,3887.483,3895.791,"To be clear, the article is more out of date than this update in August.",120,,
611,0.97,3895.791,3919.148,But it would be interesting to Contextualize the findings or the analysis from the article in the times last spring relative to where we are if it is not too much trouble to send that over.,120,,
612,0.97,3919.148,3919.415,Thanks.,120,,
613,0.97,3919.415,3920.149,That sounds great.,121,,
614,0.97,3920.149,3921.417,I will keep us moving along.,121,,
615,0.97,3921.417,3922.818,We have 10 more slides to go.,121,,
616,0.97,3922.818,3926.522,We will try to give this another 20 minutes or so so we can get to some questions.,121,,
617,0.97,3926.522,3927.723,I think this has been helpful.,121,,
618,0.97,3927.723,3936.232,Both Councilmembers have been asking important questions.,121,,
619,0.97,3936.232,4025.021,"Dave, the response to the follow-up on some of those, I think it is an important take away that just because we see a higher than national level of office vacancy rates, that does not equal people being out of jobs at higher rates in Seattle necessarily because our ability to work from home at higher rates as you noted in place like San Francisco, Boston and Seattle, we have an opportunity to think about how we Reimagine what working within the city looks like and how our industries can be accommodating to this new way of working whether it is remotely or working in the office space so that is an important take away--also note that as chair of the Seattle city employees retirement systems--this is something we have been discussing over the last year and a half as well of the investment Committee--there is a national maybe International conversation about how changes in the use of office space will affect how people decide to make investments, where businesses want to place themselves and trying to stay ahead of sort of the guessing game on that is something I think the international community is still grappling with--what will it look like when people go back to work and where will those places be especially for certain industries where people will be able to continue to work from home or remotely?",121,,
620,0.97,4025.021,4041.971,So I think it is an important way for us to both be optimistic about the type of industries that are able to sustain and in fact see record profits in our region here but also how we adapt and make sure that there is activation as we talked about yesterday of our Street spaces and we are creating accommodations for all types of new industries but just seeing that number at a high level does not equal people having lost those positions.,121,,
621,0.97,4041.971,4047.543,"It is just a different place that those individuals are working--Okay, I saw some nods as I said that's all take it as a good sign.",121,,
622,0.97,4047.543,4049.745,It's keep going and get through these next 10 slides.,121,,
623,0.97,4049.745,4053.082,Let's look at changes in the economic forecast for West first then the regional economy.,122,,
624,0.97,4053.082,4056.852,"Since March, ages market has Úpriced down probably the estimate scenario to 20%?",122,,
625,0.97,4056.852,4084.613,"They have increased the forecast for employment, for retail sales--again, part of it is basically [Indiscernible] is what happened in the first half of 2021, and then the second part would be what happens to the second half of 2021.",122,,
626,0.97,4084.613,4094.423,The chart here and the table compare July baseline scenario to March scenario.,122,,
627,0.97,4094.423,4119.014,"For April forecast, it would be best to use the scenario seen at that point in time after seeing the last quarter of 2020, the economy, the national and the regional were cracking pessimistic scenario much closer than the baseline because of personnel place and retail sales outperforming in the first half.",122,,
628,0.97,4119.014,4124.587,We sell revenue that outperformed our April forecast.,122,,
629,0.97,4124.587,4130.793,It gave us reasons to switch to the Baselines.,122,,
630,0.97,4130.793,4134.864,[Indiscernible] later on when we get to the revenue section.,122,,
631,0.97,4134.864,4161.056,"That increase would have been there even if we did not switch from pessimistic and stick to the pessimistic scenario, there would have been a significant upward tradition because as you saw in the first slide, the forecast for sales was significant regardless of [Indiscernible] which scenario we were looking at.",122,,
632,0.97,4161.056,4192.188,"[Indiscernible] increase the demand which surprised all the forecasters, there has been quite a significant increase in inflation that came as rather negative surprise last three months, the increased demand faced some supply chain disruption and bottlenecks which led to prices growing much faster than expected, and [Indiscernible] faster than what was expected to happen.",122,,
633,0.97,4192.188,4198.494,The overall inflation forecast went from 1.93.7.,122,,
634,0.97,4198.494,4214.276,If we can go to the next slide--that inflation forecast is important because it fits into our CPI W inflation forecast which is used for Awi inflation adjustments.,122,,
635,0.97,4214.276,4232.194,"In addition to increasing personal Outplace employment, we are also predicting now a much higher than previously expected inflation for 2021 and 2022.",122,,
636,0.97,4232.194,4245.374,[Indiscernible] that matters for the budgeting context because it drives labor cost as well is Nonlabor cost in the city.,123,,
637,0.97,4245.374,4251.547,That is a pressure point in terms of balancing our overall revenues and expenditures.,123,,
638,0.97,4251.547,4258.587,"And again, we wanted to make sure all Council numbers got to see the presentation at the same time.",124,,
639,0.97,4258.587,4264.326,"So I didn't have a chance to ask you in advance, I think it would be helpful on these two slides to have an apples to apples comparison.",124,,
640,0.97,4264.326,4272.334,Can we look at the July and March baseline comparisons like the baseline compared to the pessimistic?,124,,
641,0.97,4272.334,4274.77,That would be helpful for us to see how those tracked over time.,124,,
642,0.97,4274.77,4275.871,Please go ahead.,124,,
643,0.97,4275.871,4280.309,We will provide that to central stuff and update numbers as well.,125,,
644,0.97,4280.309,4288.217,We had information worried about complexity and length of the presentation.,125,,
645,0.97,4288.217,4290.986,I suggested we tried to streamline some of this.,125,,
646,0.97,4290.986,4296.191,I appreciate.,126,,
647,0.97,4296.191,4316.712,"Also, this relatively good news, I think it would be helpful to have a better understanding of the Mayor intends to use the baseline forecast for the fall budget and given that we use the pessimistic fall budget projections last year, can you sort of reiterate how you have made a decision to go from the pessimistic to the baseline?",126,,
648,0.97,4316.712,4360.956,"I know there are national factors to consider when making those decisions, but it would be helpful to have a better understanding with colleagues as well if you have ideas about how where we can see Transparently where the baseline versus the pessimistic forecast plays out so if we end up having a budget that is transmitted that uses a baseline sort of more optimistic projection, and the pessimistic projection, if anything happens with this force wave of Delta and other Covid complications if we end up having to [Indiscernible] it would be helpful for us to have a better understanding of how these projections play out so director noble, you all are assuming that you will use the baseline projections for your creation of the fall budget?",126,,
649,0.97,4360.956,4361.957,I have a slide.,127,,
650,0.97,4361.957,4371.3,I'm prepared to talk to that just ahead as we shift from economic perspective to the narrowly into the revenue side--we will get there shortly.,127,,
651,0.97,4371.3,4379.875,I'm going to move us on to the next slide.,127,,
652,0.97,4379.875,4408.904,"All right, wrapping up the economic forecast, in terms of the forecast rates obviously the Delta strain is the number one cause of concern here where the [Indiscernible] forecast has been released the beginning of July, it was essentially the peak of good news and the lowest point in the probably--in the number of cases you see on the right.",128,,
653,0.97,4408.904,4414.009,"Since then, several things occurred, mostly on [Indiscernible] side.",128,,
654,0.97,4414.009,4417.679,Now the agents do not see mandatory restrictions imposed by the government.,128,,
655,0.97,4417.679,4458.754,"The number of cases can lead to consumers just being more cautious, spending less, avoiding bigger crowds, and that is quite worrying because there was an expected shift in consumer spending on goods that was Fueling the [Indiscernible] services, travel, recreation, entertainment, those were the primary factors expected to drive consumer spending--now consumers are more worried about the Delta variant.",128,,
656,0.97,4458.754,4481.21,"They might slow down, come back on with travel, spending at restaurants, and that will cause the [Indiscernible]--not because of mandatory restriction imposed by government, just that consumers are more cautious.",128,,
657,0.97,4481.21,4489.384,There has been quite a significant drop in the consumer sentiment that has been published on Friday.,128,,
658,0.97,4489.384,4495.724,"Again, seems like consumers are worried about the Delta variant.",128,,
659,0.97,4495.724,4500.462,"Consumer sentiment is not the best Predictor for spending, but it is something to watch.",128,,
660,0.97,4500.462,4506.602,Retail sales in July has been released today.,128,,
661,0.97,4506.602,4513.709,It shows a 1.1% drop which is slightly more than economists were expecting.,128,,
662,0.97,4513.709,4554.149,"Part of it was expected coming down with a large increase in sales due to physical stimulus, but the fact that the drop in retail sales [Indiscernible]--still combined with those high inflation numbers that are coming which might provide some kind of reason to delay spending for consumers, the shortage of available workers, [Indiscernible] recovery is going to be a prolonged issue.",128,,
663,0.97,4554.149,4566.461,"The bottom line here is, whatever happens to Delta is probably number one concern for the [Indiscernible] forecast.",128,,
664,0.97,4566.461,4583.612,"Including some risks to the current situation, shifting to talk about revenues and in particular, talk about the forecast scenarios have a question about baseline, so I'm going to turn this over to Dave to talk more about specific revenue numbers if you will.",129,,
665,0.97,4583.612,4603.498,"Things to remember in terms of this discussion, what we are describing our inputs to our regional model--we have a national forecast entity that we use to help feed our regional projections.",129,,
666,0.97,4603.498,4625.454,"We have a regional economic model that relies on forecast of key national Burials, things like company employment, we threw the course of regular business if you will, use their baseline forecast and baseline probabilities to different forecasts.",129,,
667,0.97,4625.454,4672.567,"Pre-Pandemic, Prerecession, the last time we invoked the pessimistic forecast I was not the budget director--again, similar to the situation where enough uncertainty and specific concern that the local economy might respond differently than the national economy, so as Covid hit a year and a half ago and we were developing the April forecast in 2020, we shifted to the pessimistic arguing there was a whole lot of uncertainty and we had reason to think that our local economy given its dependence on tourism and other key factors indirect reliance on the travel industry and the like--we had reasons to think we might be more affected than others.",129,,
668,0.97,4672.567,4680.108,"Then what we basically said at the time, this is an unusual move but we will stick with this until the data tells us we made the wrong conclusion.",129,,
669,0.97,4680.108,4703.832,And we had the same discussion in the springtime when we brought you the April forecast at the time when the recovery--you recall there was a significant upward move when we gave you November updates about four months previous to our forecast in April of this year.,129,,
670,0.97,4703.832,4711.139,"What has changed since then is we have actual data for the first two quarters of this year, and they have significantly exceeded the April forecast.",129,,
671,0.97,4711.139,4716.578,We said we would stick to the pessimistic until the data showed us and told us otherwise.,129,,
672,0.97,4716.578,4718.246,The data in the door are telling us otherwise.,129,,
673,0.97,4718.246,4723.018,We have performed very well locally.,129,,
674,0.97,4723.018,4729.691,The economy has seemingly adapted to some degree to Covid.,129,,
675,0.97,4729.691,4741.803,"Obviously, there were lifting of restrictions although those listings happened later in the second quarter--then in the first or most of the second so again, we are talking about the end of June as the end of the second quarter.",129,,
676,0.97,4741.803,4768.663,"The other thing that we highlighted was going to be factors, what probabilities of national forecast's placing on their forecasts--back when we started using the pessimistic forecast in April of 2019 or April 2020 forecast--I forget the exact year--it was marginally higher probability to the baseline but not much.",129,,
677,0.97,4768.663,4776.972,"They didn't have the confidence that the baseline was the strongest of the forecast, if you will.",129,,
678,0.97,4776.972,4785.113,That has changed as well as you can see.,129,,
679,0.97,4785.113,4798.894,So the forecast you will see in a moment uses the baseline forecast as the national level to input to the regional model and you will see--and most of what it is going to do in the actual numbers is to acknowledge that there are significant additional revenues in 20--21.,129,,
680,0.97,4798.894,4806.201,A good share of those have already been realized again because of what we have experienced over the past few months.,129,,
681,0.97,4806.201,4823.819,"For 22 you will see there is a small increment of revenue in the bigger picture, and that is the one that is Arguably most at risk here and as I said, and I think it is a really important point.",129,,
682,0.97,4823.819,4848.877,"Knowing the uncertainty about these revenues is going to affect how we think about building the budget with them, in particular, knowing they may not ultimately be realized, don't think it makes sense to commit to a budget with ongoing expenditures any more than is necessary, rather to focus on using some of these resources to address some one-time opportunities we might have.",129,,
683,0.97,4848.877,4869.397,"Another thing I would add is a factor considering this is that the Federal assistance--and we are due a second tranche of the Coronavirus local relief funds, Clifford dollars--and we had one of the eligible uses for those dollars was to replace city revenues.",129,,
684,0.97,4869.397,4875.07,"So if, in fact, we end up with the revenue forecast moving in the wrong direction, there would be a potential to use those resources as well.",129,,
685,0.97,4875.07,4876.504,We have tools to address that.,129,,
686,0.97,4876.504,4885.28,We would be building a budget sensitive to the uncertainties in the forecast which are inherent no matter which basis we use.,129,,
687,0.97,4885.28,4891.72,So --,129,,
688,0.97,4891.72,4891.987,,130,,
689,0.97,4891.987,4896.791,We are watching the Seattle rescue plan or --,131,,
690,0.97,4896.791,4899.027,Coronavirus local relief funds is the --,132,,
691,0.97,4899.027,4904.099,And Council member Harold has a comment or question.,133,,
692,0.97,4904.099,4948.043,"Trying to get some clarity, you are providing what I hear as a compelling argument for why the decision might be made, but this last bullet here seems to suggest that there is more uncertainty about that decision.",134,,
693,0.97,4948.043,4959.421,Future virus -Induced policy [Indiscernible] economic activity may again lead to Seattle's deviation from national forecast expectations.,134,,
694,0.97,4959.421,4973.401,"And the words that seem to follow, it might be and return to the pessimistic growth scenario expectation.",134,,
695,0.97,4973.401,4985.58,"So on one hand, I'm hearing you say there has been a decision made to use one set of projections, but this last bullet seems to suggest that could change.",134,,
696,0.97,4985.58,4988.016,"I'm just trying to get a little more understanding of, is that so?",134,,
697,0.97,4988.016,4988.616,Could it change?,134,,
698,0.97,4988.616,5002.263,"And when is it likely to--if there is a change, would it happen before a proposed budget in September?",134,,
699,0.97,5002.263,5002.997,Good question.,135,,
700,0.97,5002.997,5005.3,"It clearly could change, right?",135,,
701,0.97,5005.3,5010.338,That has been the challenge through all of this.,135,,
702,0.97,5010.338,5020.215,"We have been forecasting the economy, keeping an eye on the virus, if you will, and whatever else I am, I'm certainly not a doctor of medicine.",135,,
703,0.97,5020.215,5023.752,So that has been a challenge.,135,,
704,0.97,5023.752,5035.53,So the information we have now and what we know now is underlying this forecast that we will build a budget upon.,135,,
705,0.97,5035.53,5046.741,"As you are describing, knowing uncertainty in revenues and Ideally committing or suggesting expenses that are consistent, we could back off if we need to.",135,,
706,0.97,5046.741,5061.956,"One of the reasons, just real quick, one of the reasons comfortable doing that in part is that before the final budget is adopted in November, late November, we will provide another update.",135,,
707,0.97,5061.956,5069.864,So we have time between now and when the city is ultimately committed to its budget to gather some additional information.,135,,
708,0.97,5069.864,5071.166,"And again, I will put this direct.",135,,
709,0.97,5071.166,5087.315,"If there is a downward forecast, we need to work with you to adjust the budget accordingly.",135,,
710,0.97,5087.315,5101.262,"I am suggesting we are anticipating the potential going in, and we will build a budget if that is the scenario we end up in, we will be in a position to work with you and do that Ideally in a way that will not cause major disruptions for instance in the situation where city employees for critical services that we are providing as part of our baseline.",135,,
711,0.97,5101.262,5103.665,So we are going to be thoughtful about how we allocate additional resources.,135,,
712,0.97,5103.665,5107.902,"I know this is an unusual thing to suggest, but these are very unusual times.",136,,
713,0.97,5107.902,5113.808,Might you consider proposing to budgets in September?,136,,
714,0.97,5113.808,5118.012,Two different options?,136,,
715,0.97,5118.012,5143.838,"Candidly, it is challenging enough to put together one Nevermind in the context of remote work and the like, but what I begin to describe is we will be in a position to highlight to you places where the proposed expenditures could be reduced if and when there was a reduction in revenues and in ways that will not be disruptive--more disruptive than necessary if you will.",137,,
716,0.97,5143.838,5145.14,It is obviously a dynamic situation.,137,,
717,0.97,5145.14,5153.248,"I recognize the question, pledging to be clear in partners how we manage this and the goal will not be to set anybody up for failure.",137,,
718,0.97,5153.248,5167.962,"At the same time, there are policy goals that the Council has set out, that the Mayor has, that I think the budget should and can speak to even with the level of uncertainty we are facing.",137,,
719,0.97,5167.962,5173.601,I appreciate the Vice- chair's question.,138,,
720,0.97,5173.601,5177.906,That was similar to the question I was asking earlier about having to undo and redo a budget near the end.,138,,
721,0.97,5177.906,5180.375,That would be problematic.,138,,
722,0.97,5180.375,5186.014,"Director no bland team, I will ask you to go quickly through the next four slides so we can finish the presentation.",138,,
723,0.97,5186.014,5190.518,We will see if there are additional questions at that time.,138,,
724,0.97,5190.518,5216.744,We may also want to do another sort of Walk-Through of this as you maybe receive more information mid-September prior to the Mayor transmitting her budget as well given the changing nature of Covid and its impact on our local economies across the country but let's get through the next four slides because we really do want to try to reserve a full hour for the items related to the supplemental budget discussion.,138,,
725,0.97,5216.744,5217.145,Dave.,139,,
726,0.97,5217.145,5223.418,"Really quickly, we can go through, then the table at the end.",140,,
727,0.97,5223.418,5231.96,We have received 2020 data from Washington state employment security Department revised our revenue [Indiscernible] a little bit.,141,,
728,0.97,5231.96,5234.896,There is large amount of forecast risks here.,141,,
729,0.97,5234.896,5246.874,"Some of the upside, a lot of the downside, they potentially can offset each other or move the revenue one way or the other.",141,,
730,0.97,5246.874,5256.618,"There is very little information for us, and there is large amount of uncertainty here.",141,,
731,0.97,5256.618,5259.787,This is the payroll tax.,142,,
732,0.97,5259.787,5266.894,We have yet to receive payments for 2021 until the early part of 2022.,142,,
733,0.97,5266.894,5269.631,So we have been cautious and tried to be conservative in the forecast.,142,,
734,0.97,5269.631,5282.777,"A small Uptick, again, based on the data we are seeing from the economy, remaining conservative going forward, we will know more early next year.",142,,
735,0.97,5282.777,5290.485,I'm going to keep us moving.,143,,
736,0.97,5290.485,5300.395,"For sales on B & amp; O tax as mentioned a couple times, the first--in the first half of 2021, they outperformed our forecast.",144,,
737,0.97,5300.395,5305.133,It was built on the pessimistic scenario.,144,,
738,0.97,5305.133,5311.806,They actually outperformed what would have been the revenue forecast using the baseline scenario significantly.,144,,
739,0.97,5311.806,5317.712,And that is a part of why the revenue forecast for 2021 overall has improved.,144,,
740,0.97,5317.712,5321.949,"Next slide, please.",144,,
741,0.97,5321.949,5348.142,"For real estate size tax, tax revenue is on track during [Indiscernible] 2.9 million forecast from April . prices of homes have been rising faster than expected, but on the other side, there has been a larger than expected drop in sales of family homes here.",144,,
742,0.97,5348.142,5366.961,"They are predicted to be about 9% lower, 8.9 for single-family homes, 8.4 for condos which would be offsetting the large increase in the price of homes.",144,,
743,0.97,5366.961,5370.498,"Next slide, please.",144,,
744,0.97,5370.498,5370.898,Great.,145,,
745,0.97,5370.898,5379.674,Let's have a look at the revenue tables.,145,,
746,0.97,5379.674,5381.476,This is perhaps what you have all been waiting for.,145,,
747,0.97,5381.476,5384.345,As you can see this is the standard table on the left-hand side.,145,,
748,0.97,5384.345,5386.314,"We have tax items, revenue items listed across the top.",145,,
749,0.97,5386.314,5388.382,You can see the time periods that we are talking about.,145,,
750,0.97,5388.382,5401.362,"The left-hand side columns, 2020 Actuals and 2021 adopted, move into the forecasts, April and August, then we provide a column right in the middle that shows the change between the August forecast in the April forecast.",145,,
751,0.97,5401.362,5412.807,And the same pattern repeats for the 2022 forecast with April and August and changes August and April.,145,,
752,0.97,5412.807,5423.551,"As you can see, it has been alluded to halfway through the page on the fund total line for the change August over April, you see $50.8 million increase in revenues in that center column.",145,,
753,0.97,5423.551,5435.53,That is just capturing all the growth that JAN described with physical stimulus and so forth.,145,,
754,0.97,5435.53,5452.213,"But then as you see to the far right-hand side in the August and April column, a $29 million increase in general revenues which, again, captured the notion of a bit of moderation as the stimulus wears off, as economic growth and activity returns to a Non-Stimulated status, this is the growth we expect.",145,,
755,0.97,5452.213,5465.76,"Real quick, we can think of the 50+ million as a one-time revenue because it is landing in 21.",146,,
756,0.97,5465.76,5477.271,We don't see the same increment carried into 22.,146,,
757,0.97,5481.676,5485.479,The increment for 22 at $29 million is actually in the neighborhood less than 2% of the general fund.,146,,
758,0.97,5485.479,5493.387,"It is an absolute number that seems large but relative to the overall budget it is small if you consider the effects of inflation that we noted are higher and the like, it is not a significant increment.",146,,
759,0.97,5493.387,5501.362,"There is one time opportunity associated with the 21 increase, but again, as we think about budgeting, we have to be thoughtful and recognize that is a one-time resource, so just highlighting those two points.",146,,
760,0.97,5501.362,5512.773,"We can come back and talk about specific revenues if you wish, but just to move on--we have two lines of payroll expects stance.",147,,
761,0.97,5512.773,5518.613,-- exception tax.,147,,
762,0.97,5518.613,5520.014,We have created a new fund.,147,,
763,0.97,5520.014,5521.883,You have created a new fund for the revenue stream.,147,,
764,0.97,5521.883,5538.933,"That is down in the lower section which with--[Indiscernible] and as JAN pointed out a few slides ago, the payroll expects tax--expense tax, we are expecting modest increases.",147,,
765,0.97,5538.933,5542.937,"Then you see [Indiscernible], the Mercer mega block sale is there.",147,,
766,0.97,5542.937,5552.079,"Commercial parking tax, school zone camera fund--those are all showing growth except school zone camera Fund.",147,,
767,0.97,5552.079,5568.763,That is an adjustment downward because the April forecast assumed the addition of 10 new camera locations or 10 new cameras and that has been reduced recently to only three being installed by September of this year and so that is the reduction there.,147,,
768,0.97,5568.763,5591.085,"And then and so--again, looking at the change columns, we are adding $1.2 million in other general government revenues and decreasing about 5.1 in 2022 largely again as you can see because of the school zone camera Fund.",147,,
769,0.97,5591.085,5616.11,"If we go to the next slide just to finish the overall overview I guess--we have a missions tax, real estate tax pulled out here, and omissions tax revenues are increasing over April forecasts because we have now incorporated a new estimate of what admissions activity is going to happen at the climate pledge arena.",147,,
770,0.97,5616.11,5624.018,"So, that is capturing that.",147,,
771,0.97,5624.018,5635.229,"I would NOTE on that front, the increment associated with climate pledge arena is not an increment that will be available for us to spend part of the development agreement with Nhl Seattle and those groups.",148,,
772,0.97,5635.229,5641.669,It is that the increment of admission tax revenue is an offset of their rent.,148,,
773,0.97,5641.669,5649.043,They are guaranteeing us the same level of omissions tax from what had been Q arena is now climate place arena.,148,,
774,0.97,5649.043,5651.245,We are not losing relative to where we were before.,148,,
775,0.97,5651.245,5656.283,They rebuilt the arena.,148,,
776,0.97,5656.283,5658.953,The increment of the admissions tax is the offset to their rent.,148,,
777,0.97,5658.953,5660.354,It is the revenue side of that.,148,,
778,0.97,5660.354,5666.961,The expenditure side is a need to consider the fact.,148,,
779,0.97,5666.961,5668.262,This is the last slide.,149,,
780,0.97,5668.262,5670.297,Are there any comments before I turn it to Council members?,149,,
781,0.97,5670.297,5674.769,[Indiscernible] we like our forecast.,150,,
782,0.97,5674.769,5677.671,It is staying steady.,150,,
783,0.97,5677.671,5678.072,Okay.,151,,
784,0.97,5678.072,5680.875,We like that too.,151,,
785,0.97,5680.875,5683.31,"Townsend member Lewis, you had the first hand up.",151,,
786,0.97,5683.31,5684.311,Thank you Madam chair.,152,,
787,0.97,5684.311,5694.488,"If we go back to the previous slide here, I just want to ask a question about the commercial parking tax of all things.",152,,
788,0.97,5694.488,5708.502,"In the April 22 to August 2022, there is going to be a projected Drop-Off in the commercial parking tax.",152,,
789,0.97,5708.502,5710.137,What are we are treating that too?,152,,
790,0.97,5710.137,5712.74,"The consumer is paying this, right?",152,,
791,0.97,5712.74,5731.058,"Or their finding places and parking, why are we anticipating--a decline between April and August of 2022 when we have been seeing a steady increase as people are getting out more?",152,,
792,0.97,5731.058,5733.26,I am curious --,152,,
793,0.97,5733.26,5741.836,It is effectively a Recalibration of what the Actuals are receiving.,153,,
794,0.97,5741.836,5746.54,"Essentially, I was Overestimating.",153,,
795,0.97,5746.54,5761.088,So I am trying to adjust it downward to reflect to a base where the Actuals more Robustly support.,153,,
796,0.97,5761.088,5765.159,"So while there is more activity, there is more parking going on, I was off in the April forecast.",153,,
797,0.97,5765.159,5774.969,"All right, I appreciate the clarification.",154,,
798,0.97,5774.969,5784.111,"Colleagues, I want to thank you all for your questions today.",155,,
799,0.97,5784.111,5787.014,I want to thank the team from CBO and the forecast office for the presentation.,155,,
800,0.97,5787.014,5790.184,I know that central staff has been poring over the report since we received it yesterday.,155,,
801,0.97,5790.184,5800.127,I do want to make sure that we get a chance to hear if there is anything else from central us . F you would like to fly for I want to thank director noble who has just agreed to be able to be available one month from now.,155,,
802,0.97,5800.127,5803.063,We are meeting on September 17th.,155,,
803,0.97,5803.063,5814.508,We would like to invite the team back to see if there is any information that might be new at that time especially given the changes with the Covid Delta variant.,155,,
804,0.97,5814.508,5820.648,So appreciate your commitment to come back one month from now to see if that influences our budget discussions as we head into deliberations for the fall budget committee.,155,,
805,0.97,5820.648,5820.948,Thank you.,155,,
806,0.97,5820.948,5826.12,"Central staff, is there anything else you would add from your initial review or any questions you would like to see followed up on as well?",155,,
807,0.97,5826.12,5832.326,"No, chair Mosqueda.",156,,
808,0.97,5832.326,5843.771,The discussion covered the highlights and remarks.,156,,
809,0.97,5843.771,5845.472,This is a key question to consider.,156,,
810,0.97,5845.472,5846.24,That was my assessment.,156,,
811,0.97,5846.24,5848.442,That seems to be the assessment of the committee as well.,156,,
812,0.97,5848.442,5848.809,Excellent.,157,,
813,0.97,5848.809,5849.009,Okay.,157,,
814,0.97,5849.009,5850.277,Last call on questions or comments.,157,,
815,0.97,5850.277,5850.678,Anything else?,157,,
816,0.97,5850.678,5852.146,I just want to say thank you.,158,,
817,0.97,5852.146,5858.652,[Indiscernible],158,,
818,0.97,5858.652,5860.054,We will let you all go.,159,,
819,0.97,5860.054,5863.057,"Thank you John, thank you Dave, thank you central staff and director noble.",159,,
820,0.97,5863.057,5865.759,We will keep our team with us as we move onto the next item.,159,,
821,0.97,5865.759,5868.762,Madam clerk Emma let's read item number five into the record.,159,,
822,0.97,5868.762,5901.895,"Agenda item number five, council bill 120112, an ordinance [Indiscernible] human services Department, [Indiscernible], Seattle [Indiscernible] funding and subsidized loans into execute [Indiscernible] funding agreements.",160,,
823,0.97,5901.895,5903.297,For further discussion and possible vote.,160,,
824,0.97,5903.297,5911.338,"As you can see from the agenda, this includes midyear grant acceptance ordinance and item number five, and item number six is the midyear supplemental.",161,,
825,0.97,5911.338,5914.708,We do have an hour booked in for these items.,161,,
826,0.97,5914.708,5934.962,My understanding is item number five would be relatively quick compared to the longer discussion on Supplementals.,161,,
827,0.97,5934.962,5948.575,"We ordered it to put the grant acceptance ordinance which is item number five first, but we do want to reserve the hour if we can for full discussions and any questions on both of these topics expecting the larger part of the discussion to be about the supplemental budget [Indiscernible]. Tom Mikesell, thanks for staying with us as we move to the item.",161,,
828,0.97,5948.575,5956.05,I want to thank you also Allie put Mucci and your central staff teams as well who have been in conversations with myself and others on these bills.,161,,
829,0.97,5956.05,5963.223,We have the [Indiscernible] in front of us as a periodic ordinance that we accept funds to the city for various departments.,161,,
830,0.97,5963.223,5975.336,We did have this in committee the last two meetings as well so I did want to see if Tom you have any other ordinance competence and I'm happy to open it up to Council members for any questions or comments they might have on 120111--Tom?,161,,
831,0.97,5975.336,5979.974,Thank you Council members and chair Mosqueda.,162,,
832,0.97,5979.974,5999.593,"There is not much to add except there is external funding to be added in this ordinance, and as of today, I have not received any amendment requests from committee members.",162,,
833,0.97,5999.593,6004.031,"Wonderful, with the orientation, Council members, are there questions you have been Percolating on you would like to ask at this point?",163,,
834,0.97,6004.031,6005.366,Please go ahead Vice-Chair hurtled.,163,,
835,0.97,6005.366,6007.301,Thank you.,164,,
836,0.97,6007.301,6075.569,"I just want to make note that it is my understanding that departments grants are included in this legislation and given that there was last year significant interest in some of the grants that were proposed to be accepted by the city council proposed by Seattle police Department, and this happened last year, I am concerned we are again going to be in a situation where we are asked to approve acceptance of the grants late in the year without a conversation with CBO or SPD on which grants the Council would like a little more engagement on before SPD pursue them in which grant acceptance actions are more sterile and sort of perform.",164,,
837,0.97,6075.569,6108.836,"I believe last year we had agreement with the city budget office that they would work with us on such an approach and work specifically with Council central staff in determining which grants the Council was interested in doing a deep dive policy engagement on and which grants were--the approval was more Performa and not something we needed to get into the details of, and to my knowledge, that hasn't happened.",164,,
838,0.97,6108.836,6113.373,I mentioned this in previous committee meetings.,164,,
839,0.97,6113.373,6139.833,"My concern is rather than have a conversation about those grants that might involve controversy, we are subject thing--Subjecting every grant that they want from city Council to accept--we are Subjecting this entire process to controversy potentially when we do not need to do so.",164,,
840,0.97,6139.833,6171.865,"And again, I am worried about that happening at the end of the year after we have entered into agreements and turned into agreements with other jurisdictions to do joint work or to act as the past administrator for other jurisdictions and just wanting to flag that now--flagged the absence of this conversation over the past year as [Indiscernible].",164,,
841,0.97,6171.865,6180.574,"Thank you Vice-Chair Herbold, your concerns are well received and shared.",165,,
842,0.97,6180.574,6188.081,I see great from central staff who leads our analysis on SPD.,165,,
843,0.97,6188.081,6196.023,We do know there is an anticipated ordinance that is going to be sent down to city Council to accept those grants.,165,,
844,0.97,6196.023,6199.526,Did you have anything else you'd like to add in terms of anticipation around that?,165,,
845,0.97,6199.526,6203.497,I think it is on its way.,166,,
846,0.97,6203.497,6205.933,I think it will be available for you all in September.,166,,
847,0.97,6205.933,6214.908,You will have a very tight Timeframe between the time you get back from recess and the annual budget.,166,,
848,0.97,6214.908,6217.411,"It is really one meeting, probably.",166,,
849,0.97,6217.411,6242.536,And Thus the concerns from Vice-Chair hurtled . We look forward to working with you on that.,167,,
850,0.97,6242.536,6244.571,Vice-Chair Herbold was next.,167,,
851,0.97,6244.571,6258.952,"My understanding, why are SPD grant accepting actions not in this bill like we do every year?",168,,
852,0.97,6258.952,6262.456,We don't segregate out all the police Department's grant acceptance from every other Department in the city.,168,,
853,0.97,6262.456,6266.927,Why has that occurred this year?,168,,
854,0.97,6266.927,6271.565,If anybody knows --,168,,
855,0.97,6271.565,6275.869,I can't speak for the executive on that.,169,,
856,0.97,6275.869,6305.298,"Just to be clear on the answer though, if you are saying you can't speak for the executive on that, are we being led to believe that that was an executive choice to not include it in their supplemental budget or was this a Council generated issue?",170,,
857,0.97,6305.298,6309.77,It was obviously an executive choice to not put it in the budget that they sent down.,171,,
858,0.97,6309.77,6320.347,It was a Council request last year as Councilmember Herbold said to do something different.,171,,
859,0.97,6320.347,6329.456,Something different was to address it earlier in an ordinance before now.,171,,
860,0.97,6329.456,6345.939,"And I think, you know, if I were to speculate, half of it got done in the sense that it is not being done now and the half that was supposed to be the other half of the message that it was supposed to be done earlier didn't reach.",171,,
861,0.97,6345.939,6348.375,So there was a Disconnect.,171,,
862,0.97,6348.375,6421.314,"And I think the reality is Council plays a budget oversight role in fulfilling that oversight role, we asked for communication and clear setup of expectations around whatever information we wanted to receive in order to allow for the normal process to unfold in a way that didn't feel like we were being jammed or didn't have all the information available to us to make the evaluation of what is [Indiscernible] versus what appears to be a grant that is driving policy or operations at the Department in the way that could be consistent with prior policy positions so I--it is unfortunate to hear we are in a situation where we are running the bill as a separate Stand-Alone bill when I don't think that was our intention in the first place.",172,,
863,0.97,6421.314,6425.919,"Seeing nod from the Vice-Chair as well as from me, so yes, I think there is additional communication needed on this piece.",172,,
864,0.97,6425.919,6436.363,Appreciate the back ground from Vice-Chair Herbold and from Greg Doss here and the underscoring from the Council President.,172,,
865,0.97,6436.363,6444.838,Okay.,172,,
866,0.97,6444.838,6456.449,"Putting that concern aside, the acceptance ordinance is ahead of us, 120111, not seeing any additional questions, and central staff has noted we are not aware of additional amendments to Council colleagues, I move we recommend passage of bill 120111.",172,,
867,0.97,6456.449,6457.05,Is there a second?,172,,
868,0.97,6457.05,6457.651,Second.,173,,
869,0.97,6457.651,6462.522,"Vice-Chair, any additional comments or questions?",174,,
870,0.97,6462.522,6466.059,"Hearing and seeing none, Madam clerk, will you please call the roll on passage bill of 120111?",174,,
871,0.97,6466.059,6468.595,Vice-Chair Herbold?,175,,
872,0.97,6468.595,6479.105,Council President Gonzalez?,175,,
873,0.97,6480.841,6481.374,I.,176,,
874,0.97,6481.374,6481.975,Councilmember Lewis.,177,,
875,0.97,6481.975,6482.409,Yes.,178,,
876,0.97,6482.409,6482.976,Madam chair?,179,,
877,0.97,6482.976,6483.41,I.,180,,
878,0.97,6483.41,6485.078,"Madam chair, four in favor, not opposed.",181,,
879,0.97,6485.078,6486.279,Thank you very much.,182,,
880,0.97,6486.279,6486.646,Motion carries.,182,,
881,0.97,6486.646,6505.832,The acceptance ordinance from midyear 2021 bill Council bill 120111 will be sent to the Seattle city council full council meeting on September 13th with a recommendation that the bill pass the final vote there.,182,,
882,0.97,6505.832,6506.933,"Thank you very much, central staff.",182,,
883,0.97,6506.933,6510.837,"If you can stick with us, let's move on to the other big item related to the supplemental budget.",182,,
884,0.97,6510.837,6512.906,Madam clerk McKinney Reed item number six into the record.,182,,
885,0.97,6512.906,6528.521,"Agenda item number six, council bill 120112, an ordinance which adopted the 2021 budget including the 2021 2026 capital improvement program for breathing discussion and also possible vote.",182,,
886,0.97,6528.521,6534.728,"Okay, thank you very much colleagues.",183,,
887,0.97,6534.728,6537.831,This is the third meeting we have had the supplemental budget in front of us today.,183,,
888,0.97,6537.831,6554.347,"I want to thank Tom Mikesell, Greg Doss, everyone for helping with this today and I want to thank Allie Ben Deci who is not with us because she is on leave but had very much from that leave and her work on this prior to her vacation.",183,,
889,0.97,6554.347,6558.184,"Colleagues, we want to make sure we have ample time to get through these comments in front of us.",183,,
890,0.97,6558.184,6570.363,"We do have for the five minutes to discuss this, and we will try as much as possible to get through this in the allotted time.",183,,
891,0.97,6570.363,6587.414,"We have three more sections on our agenda after this so if we end up running into close to 1:00 p.m., I will notify the clerks if we take recess.",183,,
892,0.97,6587.414,6590.884,I do intend to come back and finish the 3 to 4 items that are just briefings.,183,,
893,0.97,6590.884,6593.52,"No votes required, but I will be available to continue watching that.",183,,
894,0.97,6593.52,6598.391,Let's endeavor to get through this together and to make sure that we get a chance to have our full agenda in front of us.,183,,
895,0.97,6598.391,6600.994,This is a reminder that we are talking about the supplemental budget.,183,,
896,0.97,6600.994,6621.414,Ideally we would not have large policy shifts included in the supplemental budget given the conversation that has evolved mostly through letters to Council regarding a request from the Mayor's office for some larger policy shifts specifically in public safety related--we did delay a vote on the Submittal package at our last meeting to consider some of the possible policy and investment considerations.,183,,
897,0.97,6621.414,6622.949,We really appreciate the Council members here today.,183,,
898,0.97,6622.949,6705.398,The full Council has been participating with us as the discussion has included all the Council members and your flexibility to think through various amendments and priorities in the supplemental and again I want to thank central staff for being so flexible and willing to help craft various amendment in front of us and again colleagues for those members who are out of city council but not members of the Finance housing committee as chair I will present the amendments on their behalf and offer the chance for those who are present to speak to them even if they are not on committee and that will give us a chance to incorporate additional health members who are here for Councilmembers who are not here with us today but do have amendments as well I will be offering those for the purposes of discussion and vote today--we will move three amendments as ordered in the table and the attachment that came with the 11 amendments that were presented and I will ask those sponsors of the amendment to move the amendment to put it in front of us and then I will ask central staff to walk through the amendment and then we will have a chance for the sponsors to speak to the amendment and we can have discussion and if there are amendments to those of minutes we will consider those and my hope is that we will wrap this up around noon today!,183,,
899,0.97,6705.398,6715.108,Let's do central staff introductions for the record we have with us I see Tom Mikesell Greg Doss Dan Eater Jeff Simms and am I missing anybody else from central staff?,183,,
900,0.97,6715.108,6715.508,"Okay, wonderful.",183,,
901,0.97,6715.508,6721.715,"Well with that, do you have any additional comments to open us up to the conversation here Tom or should we go against the list of amendments in front of us?",183,,
902,0.97,6721.715,6737.964,"Madam chair, no real additional comments other than to say the table bill I will be sharing includes some amendments that have been discussed in prior meetings and some amendments that have received Subsequence to that and they are generally in order of the receipt.",184,,
903,0.97,6737.964,6739.899,But I will go ahead and share my screen.,184,,
904,0.97,6739.899,6749.743,Please go ahead.,185,,
905,0.97,6749.743,6758.818,"Colleagues, this is an amendment table that was included in published materials as well so it should be easy to follow along for folks at home who might have a tough time seeing the screen on Seattle channel or on your computer screen.",185,,
906,0.97,6758.818,6785.678,"As Thomas brings it up--perfect--I want to know that on the first set of amendments, specifically one through four, we have had a presentation on these items in the past.",185,,
907,0.97,6785.678,6788.848,There's a handful of Council members who have suggested these moments were sponsored these amendments.,185,,
908,0.97,6788.848,6793.787,"I would like to ask for your consideration today to consider the first four amendments as part of a voting block, a voting package.",185,,
909,0.97,6793.787,6817.143,"We would then walk through each four of the amendments so that the Council central staff can provide a summary of those amendments and then we would have the sponsors speak to each one but just for the purposes of time that way we could potentially vote on the 1ST for that didn't seem to have any questions in the last two meetings and would allow us to get into the other ones where I think there are some more questions so colleagues the first four--you can see on the screen there--Tom, would you mind reading the short title of the first four?",185,,
910,0.97,6817.143,6818.011,"Sure, Madam chair.",186,,
911,0.97,6818.011,6827.12,"So amendment one is sponsored by you, chair.",186,,
912,0.97,6827.12,6833.459,"This provides $150,000 in Seattle fire departments 2021 budget for mental health services for firefighters.",186,,
913,0.97,6833.459,6834.961,And I will continue down the list.,186,,
914,0.97,6834.961,6841.334,Amendment 2 is sponsored by Councilmember Gonzales.,186,,
915,0.97,6841.334,6850.043,This would add a new summary budget level in 2021 or in the 2022 budget for the office of economic revenue forecast and provide [Indiscernible] for creating the office.,186,,
916,0.97,6850.043,6864.724,Amendment number three sponsored by Council President Gonzales would add a statement of intent regarding the 2021 spending to update and enhance the disclosure technology and practices.,186,,
917,0.97,6864.724,6878.972,"And then amendment four sponsored by Council member Gonzales would add $97,000 to the city auditor Department for staffing issues in the absence of city auditor.",186,,
918,0.97,6878.972,6880.106,Thank you.,187,,
919,0.97,6880.106,6895.388,"Council members, we will have a chance for each of the sponsors to speak to the four items in the potential voting block or package.",187,,
920,0.97,6895.388,6902.095,"If there is any concerns about considering these four together, you are welcome to pull out any of the items right now and we will make sure to take a separate vote on that.",187,,
921,0.97,6902.095,6910.036,"If there is no objection, I will go ahead and we will Conside amendments one through four as one voting package.",187,,
922,0.97,6910.036,6910.837,Is there any objection?,187,,
923,0.97,6910.837,6914.24,"Hearing no objection, amendments one through four are going to be grouped together as one voting package.",187,,
924,0.97,6914.24,6919.946,Now let's go ahead and walk through the amendments--Tom did you have anything else to add before Councilmembers who sponsored these amendments speak to them?,187,,
925,0.97,6919.946,6920.747,"No, Madam chair.",188,,
926,0.97,6920.747,6921.147,I do not.,188,,
927,0.97,6921.147,6928.655,Let's give this a try.,188,,
928,0.97,6928.655,6931.224,I want to thank you for your consideration of this amendment.,189,,
929,0.97,6931.224,6937.697,"As you recall on last year's budget we allocated 150,000 to fund a mental health counselor to assist with the fire Department personnel.",189,,
930,0.97,6937.697,6986.379,"Hauling the adoption of the budget it was determined that the firefighters held trust was the best place for Rank-And- file members to access mental health services for many barriers [Indiscernible] Accessing mental health given that the hundred 50,000 halves--has not been spent, it is split into two and it allocates another mental health provider to be located at Seattle fire Department to provide a mental health provider both within Seattle fire Department's headquarters and another one within the trust as requested by rank-and-file members.",189,,
931,0.97,6986.379,7004.63,"It is anticipated there would be the need for additional services in 2022 to continue services and I know I am eager along with others to make sure we are continuing to support mental health services of those who are on the frontline especially recognizing that a fire Department is down personnel around 95 firefighters this year and they are constantly helping with multiple public health crises whether it is assisting with Covid, the crisis of homelessness, or helping to fight national Wildfires, I appreciate your consideration of this amendment.",189,,
932,0.97,7004.63,7018.778,"Seeing no questions, Councilmember--cancel President Gonzales, you are the sponsor of amendment number two.",189,,
933,0.97,7018.778,7020.113,Would you like to speak to it?,189,,
934,0.97,7020.113,7021.914,I have nothing else to add to it.,190,,
935,0.97,7021.914,7022.715,It's pretty straightforward.,190,,
936,0.97,7022.715,7025.018,We have had conversations about it in the underlying legislation.,190,,
937,0.97,7025.018,7026.185,I think it is pretty straightforward.,190,,
938,0.97,7026.185,7032.458,It Operationalize is the Council bill we passed establishing the office.,190,,
939,0.97,7032.458,7032.925,Excellent.,191,,
940,0.97,7032.925,7034.327,I look forward to supporting it.,191,,
941,0.97,7034.327,7037.93,Do you have anything else to amendment number three?,191,,
942,0.97,7037.93,7057.116,"Amendment number three, really, you know, this is sort of following through on the executive and legislative departments trust in the standing technology that is going to be necessary to enhance the city's public disclosure process.",192,,
943,0.97,7057.116,7077.57,So this is the suite of investments in the space to allow for some of the software to be purchased to prevent the loss of data that is important for us to maintain and preserve in compliance with the public records act.,192,,
944,0.97,7077.57,7108.701,"More to come on this, it will be important to make sure this funding also includes investments that are available to the legislative Department as we also have public records act investments and obligation--excuse me--obligations we must comply with so we will be doing much more work in this space in the fall budget process but this is sort of an initial step forward.",192,,
945,0.97,7108.701,7109.502,"Excellent, thank you.",193,,
946,0.97,7109.502,7118.01,"Not seeing any questions, would you like to speak to the last item in the package, number four?",193,,
947,0.97,7118.01,7119.212,This one is really important.,194,,
948,0.97,7119.212,7127.787,"The city auditor's office is housed within the legislative Department on the org chart, but they are an independent office.",194,,
949,0.97,7127.787,7160.653,"They are one of the few offices that actually didn't have to absorb budget cuts as a result of the recession last year, and this is an opportunity for us to restore some of the cost associated that is necessary for them to continue to do their auditing work.",194,,
950,0.97,7166.425,7167.56,Executive agencies and work --,194,,
951,0.97,7167.56,7167.96,Excellent.,195,,
952,0.97,7167.96,7170.196,"Not seeing additional questions on those, appreciate you bringing these forward.",195,,
953,0.97,7170.196,7172.398,Are there other comments or questions on amendments one through four?,195,,
954,0.97,7172.398,7173.065,I'm not seeing any.,195,,
955,0.97,7173.065,7175.902,"Madam clerk, will you please call the roll on the adoption of amendments 14?",195,,
956,0.97,7175.902,7178.971,Vice-Chair Herbold?,196,,
957,0.97,7178.971,7179.772,Yes.,197,,
958,0.97,7179.772,7181.774,Council member Lewis?,198,,
959,0.97,7181.774,7182.041,Yes.,199,,
960,0.97,7182.041,7184.81,Is a President Gonzalez?,200,,
961,0.97,7184.81,7188.281,Yes.,201,,
962,0.97,7188.281,7195.388,Madam chair Mosqueda.,202,,
963,0.97,7195.388,7195.988,Yes.,203,,
964,0.97,7195.988,7200.893,"Four in favor, not a post.",204,,
965,0.97,7200.893,7201.494,It carries.,204,,
966,0.97,7201.494,7210.603,Let's move on to amendment number five.,205,,
967,0.97,7210.603,7213.739,"Council member Lewis, you are listed as sponsor along with the Co-author Councilmember Pedersen.",205,,
968,0.97,7213.739,7216.309,Would you like to move the amendment to put it in front of us?,205,,
969,0.97,7216.309,7218.511,I move amendment five.,206,,
970,0.97,7218.511,7219.545,Thank you very much.,207,,
971,0.97,7219.545,7220.546,It has been moved and Seconded.,207,,
972,0.97,7220.546,7233.559,Let's turn it over to central staff and I will turn it over to the sponsor and author.,207,,
973,0.97,7233.559,7234.427,"Thank you, Madam chair.",208,,
974,0.97,7234.427,7247.64,"This is $25,000 and one term limited position to the legislative Department to add a position that would monitor investments in sheltered expansions and products [Indiscernible]. I will mute after that and turn it over to Council member Lewis.",208,,
975,0.97,7247.64,7253.679,"Thank you so much for Queuing that up, Jeff.",209,,
976,0.97,7253.679,7259.552,I believe Councilmember Pedersen is here as well.,209,,
977,0.97,7259.552,7260.586,I will make some remarks.,209,,
978,0.97,7260.586,7264.056,If Council member Pederson wants to speak to this as well I will definitely be welcome.,209,,
979,0.97,7264.056,7306.565,"His statement--you know, this is a position that Councilmember Pedersen and I conceived of after essentially complaining to each other about the lack of progress on the standing up of shelter access in our respective districts and finding we had similar experiences trying to work with external partners, the human services Department, other executive officials to really Bird-Dog down these processes and get these shelters established at a great expense of time and resources for our respective offices.",209,,
980,0.97,7306.565,7330.456,"The position is term limited given that we are anticipating over the next two years we are going to have a massive, massive amount of emergency enhanced shelter that is going to be funded by the Council.",209,,
981,0.97,7330.456,7335.528,"As we have seen from recent committee meetings, the amount of shelter the Council has funded has not been fully realized in the implementation.",209,,
982,0.97,7335.528,7337.029,There are clearly some implementation bottlenecks.,209,,
983,0.97,7337.029,7413.939,"This position can be an asset for Online Council offices to help organize the process for running down the shelter assets as a committee resource for a select Committee on homelessness which is a committee as a whole, that can help Council members in their districts to organize around Queuing up all the external and internal partners necessary to get these processes nailed down which can include things like running down reviews which have been an ongoing issue, making sure that there are not long delays in negotiations be it with the port of Seattle or sound transit or some external partners who might be's--citing something on their land--this is really trying to take what is the full FTE of oversight work that has been done across notable Council offices and aggregate it to one position that would be term limited to get these thousands of additional shelter units stood up and they are--then it would expire.",209,,
984,0.97,7414.006,7417.676,His sort of falls into Categorization.,209,,
985,0.97,7417.676,7424.717,But this is a weird issue that clearly needs to be sped up.,209,,
986,0.97,7424.717,7440.332,"I have no doubt that without Councilmember Pedersen's actions doing some of the duties of what this position would be, the University district tiny housing village would be delayed still further.",209,,
987,0.97,7440.332,7442.635,So I think there is value in a position like this.,209,,
988,0.97,7442.635,7444.837,It is a modest increase that could have a big impact.,209,,
989,0.97,7444.837,7452.545,"With that, you know, I would give it to Councilmember Pedersen to make some remarks.",209,,
990,0.97,7452.545,7455.181,"Council member Pederson, welcome and thank you for being with us today.",210,,
991,0.97,7455.181,7457.583,I know you popped into the meetings a few times.,210,,
992,0.97,7457.583,7466.759,Did you have anything else you would like to add as the author among with Councilmember Lewis?,210,,
993,0.97,7466.759,7473.065,"Thank you, and thank you for the invitation to the meeting since I am not on the Finance Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this amendment.",211,,
994,0.97,7473.065,7474.466,Consul never Lewis has articulated the amendment well.,211,,
995,0.97,7474.466,7503.362,"As we start to--as we are trying to think outside the box on how to more quickly stand up the emergency response interventions, we are working with agencies outside of city government, and it really does require a daily monitoring of the projects to know where they are stuck and to figure out who to notify so we can keep the project moving.",211,,
996,0.97,7503.362,7520.613,"We are grateful for sound transit for the port of Seattle, et cetera for working with us to think outside the box to find sites to locate tiny home villages for example so we can get people into housing and into shelter.",211,,
997,0.97,7520.613,7529.121,Central staff does a great job on the policy level tracking of this for us on the budget level and even project level.,211,,
998,0.97,7529.121,7531.757,We both experienced this.,211,,
999,0.97,7531.757,7540.733,We required daily follow-up and monitoring to make sure these were stood up faster.,211,,
1000,0.97,7540.733,7549.108,This position is unique because it is really just during the declared homelessness emergency.,211,,
1001,0.97,7549.108,7549.675,It's a temporary position.,211,,
1002,0.97,7549.675,7551.51,It is for the committee of the whole.,211,,
1003,0.97,7551.51,7552.478,It serves all nine of us.,211,,
1004,0.97,7552.478,7556.749,It is really administrative in nature and it is tracking this.,211,,
1005,0.97,7556.749,7558.651,It helps us move the ball forward.,211,,
1006,0.97,7558.651,7578.07,"This is really what it took Emma as Council member Lewis said, the University district would be further delayed if we weren't following up in this manner so it will really help everybody out.",211,,
1007,0.97,7578.07,7578.871,It is a small sum.,211,,
1008,0.97,7578.871,7582.608,It is another small but vital way we can show we are treating homelessness with urgency it deserves.,211,,
1009,0.97,7582.608,7582.975,Thank Yu.,211,,
1010,0.97,7582.975,7584.176,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",212,,
1011,0.97,7584.176,7588.714,Are there questions or comments from our other committee members?,212,,
1012,0.97,7588.714,7592.084,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",212,,
1013,0.97,7592.084,7599.591,I have a question for central staff.,213,,
1014,0.97,7599.591,7630.656,"If Jeff is available, I was wondering, could you let us know whether or not the position as described here differs from the duties of central staff, not in the development of policy, but Úsustaining Council in the implementation of policy that we have enacted?",213,,
1015,0.97,7630.656,7636.762,Do you want me to respond?,214,,
1016,0.97,7636.762,7637.396,I apologize.,215,,
1017,0.97,7637.396,7646.538,I did not fully hear the question.,215,,
1018,0.97,7646.538,7647.539,I will Chime in.,216,,
1019,0.97,7647.539,7653.746,The question was about the differences between the position at least in regard to homelessness that I serve versus how this position would function.,216,,
1020,0.97,7653.746,7664.59,"Right now, central staff in the case of Hsd, we are following up with Hsd in a generalized way on a quarterly basis to understand the implementation of Council asks.",216,,
1021,0.97,7664.59,7677.403,"So if there was a $100,000 [Indiscernible] for something, we would check in to get it completed in March to have an understanding of if the contract is out.",216,,
1022,0.97,7677.403,7685.31,We would find the process if it is Rp.,216,,
1023,0.97,7685.31,7686.712,We would check in throughout the year.,216,,
1024,0.97,7686.712,7688.981,"As needed, we would do a deep dive into specific projects.",216,,
1025,0.97,7688.981,7716.408,"If there is a specific issue we are asked to follow up on, for example, with the investment the Council has made with tiny home villages using the Seattle rescue plan dollars, I have been asked to stay on top of one Rfp to award a new contract to operate tiny home villages as issued.",216,,
1026,0.97,7716.408,7767.96,"[Indiscernible] But this position as I understand the position would be much more of a day today checking in with Hsd on what is the status--or the development Department--one of those to--on the relevant steps and would likely also engage for example with the port authority or sound transit talking to them about the issues related to finalize the lease--as far as I'm aware of--those are the types of things that were being done by Councilmember Lewis and Councilmember Pedersen's staff over the course of the past couple months to have a really firm understanding of how specifics--and there was a more day today checking in like what happened today, what happens tomorrow--where is the form--when we begin and things along those lines--Dan, you had more conversation about this than me so maybe you can Chime in if I Mischaracterized anything?",216,,
1027,0.97,7767.96,7776.101,I think that is consistent with what I have heard described for the position.,217,,
1028,0.97,7776.101,7792.584,"I would further differentiate the work that this position would do from the work of central staff in that this position would not be expected to--first of all, report to the central staff director or be part of central staff.",217,,
1029,0.97,7792.584,7798.223,It is part of a legislative assistant position.,217,,
1030,0.97,7798.223,7805.797,The rate of pay would be consistent with the legislative assistant classification.,217,,
1031,0.97,7805.797,7810.335,The reporting would happen as provided in the matrix on your screen.,217,,
1032,0.97,7810.335,7819.411,This would report directly to the chair of the select Committee on homelessness strategies and investments.,217,,
1033,0.97,7819.411,7854.346,The work as Jeff has described would be to be a liaison and sort of consistent point of contact to track the progress of the work that the executive has been doing and effectively report on that information to the chair and to the members of the select committee which are all nine members of the Seattle city council.,217,,
1034,0.97,7854.346,7856.982,I think that's all I wanted to add.,217,,
1035,0.97,7856.982,7858.05,Thank you.,218,,
1036,0.97,7858.05,7870.362,I did not understand that this position would not be within central staff and would essentially be another L.A.,218,,
1037,0.97,7870.362,7879.605,"That would report to Lewis, so I appreciate the level of clarity.",218,,
1038,0.97,7879.605,7887.88,"I will call Council President, then we will call the question.",219,,
1039,0.97,7887.88,7900.025,"So on the last point, how is that even legally possible if only by ordinance allowed to have 4 legislative aides?",220,,
1040,0.97,7900.025,7907.332,I believe I can answer that question.,221,,
1041,0.97,7907.332,7913.639,"Each individual Council office does, as you described, have I think for positions.",221,,
1042,0.97,7913.639,7916.908,We currently funded half of those positions.,221,,
1043,0.97,7916.908,7950.976,"This would add an additional legislative assistant that would not be in--directly in the office of Councilmember Lewis, but would be reporting to Whoever holds the chair of the select Committee on homelessness or the successor committee if one is named next year.",221,,
1044,0.97,7950.976,7953.145,I am not finding that to be persuasive.,222,,
1045,0.97,7953.145,8001.36,"It seems to me to be a Workaround of the potential desire and need to fully fund the fourth legislative aide position in each Councilmember office that is authorized by ordinance to exist but we have not adequately funded to the extent that that is what is needed, I think the conversation is best had for the fall budget process and would encourage us to have the conversation in the fall budget process as opposed to in the supplemental budget process and so I have concerns about that structure as the Council president of moving forward this amendment.",222,,
1046,0.97,8001.36,8030.021,"It would effectively allow one Councilmember, Whomever that Councilmember is, to have, you know, sort of an additional legislative aide in what appears to be contradiction to an ordinance that only allows us to have 4 positions for legislative aides.",222,,
1047,0.97,8030.021,8037.362,I will also say the structure as currently presented is a bit odd in that select committees are not regular committees.,222,,
1048,0.97,8037.362,8044.036,They are special committees.,222,,
1049,0.97,8044.036,8062.554,"They can go away and oftentimes do go away at the end of the two-year term, so I am concerned about where this person is going to float to should this amendment pass.",222,,
1050,0.97,8062.554,8066.191,So I think there are a lot of unknown questions about how the organization is being structured.,222,,
1051,0.97,8066.191,8247.072,"Additionally, as context, it is important for us to look at the ongoing resource needs of the legislative Department as a whole and I think that this particular amendment is being offered in the spirit of acknowledging that there are resource and capacity limitations to the work that we are maintaining to do as a city Council and the legislative Department--again, I think those are issues that need to be taken up and evaluated and discussed and Deliberated during the fall budget process and I will just sort of share for context that in 2021 the legislative Department took eight more than $780,000 budget cut to our overall budget, and it is going to take pretty significant funding increases to simply restore our Department to what was the prior funding level and I think the need that is being expressed by Councilmember Pedersen and Lewis is reflective of the impacts related to that significant budget cut that the department had to take last year in order to be responsive to the economic crisis that was facing our city and to free up funding for the needs of our constituents but again I think that there are a lot of pressing budget needs including a vacant and unfunded position within the Department that need to be addressed first in the 2022 budget process, and so I would encourage us to consider these kinds of amendments that have impacts on the legislative Department functioning resource and capacity to a core in our fall budget process which is about to give away in the next four weeks--also say that I think the budget amount of $75,000 for a temporary staffer Unfortunately SETS this up in a way that I am not sure we are going to be able to find the talent needed to be able to actually fulfill the responsibilities that are being described by the sponsor and the author and so again, I am not denying that there may be a need to increase the capacity of central staff as it relates to the work that we are required to do in the space of homelessness services, but I would encourage us to make those decisions in the full context of what the central staff and the full legislative Department need to get us back to their baseline--and there are other unfunded vacant positions within central staff that we have been holding off on filling and this proposal is in direct competition with those Pre-Existing needs!",222,,
1052,0.97,8256.615,8257.649,"Thank you, Council President.",223,,
1053,0.97,8257.649,8259.551,I'm going to call the question on amendment number five.,223,,
1054,0.97,8259.551,8260.986,I want to thank the offer.,223,,
1055,0.97,8260.986,8262.187,I want to thank the sponsor.,223,,
1056,0.97,8262.187,8264.456,Thank you for walking us through the rationale behind the proposed amendment.,223,,
1057,0.97,8264.456,8266.958,I want to note the importance of why you brought it forward.,223,,
1058,0.97,8266.958,8271.363,I don't disagree with you that there is a serious problem with lack of information and more importantly lack of implementation.,223,,

1206,0.97,9803.293,9809.232,"Councilman Herbold, I'll turn it over to you.",259,,
1207,0.97,9809.232,9834.457,"The rationale for this amendment is similar to that for the budget bill made back in May, really a recognition that the shortage of sworn officers is resulting in reduced 911 priority responses.",260,,
1208,0.97,9834.457,9857.647,We could not have planned for approximately 250 officers leaving the Seattle police Department when discussing last year a reduction of 70 officers.,260,,

1242,0.97,10278.735,10295.818,Many of us had the question of why these investments were not in the proposed 2021 budget.,264,,
1243,0.97,10295.818,10329.919,"Chief Diaz said looking at the governor's order for continued oversight, it was clear the need to enhance Scoping tools and data ANALYTICS platform of in analyzing officer and Department performance.",264,,

1455,0.97,12347.601,12371.425,I'm the policy and planning manager with the city of Seattle housing today and I'm here to give you the overview of proposed legislation which will be considered in which we'll do a more in-depth briefing September 10th.,363,,
1456,0.97,12371.425,12378.966,Normally we come to you every four years or so to make changes to the program.,363,,
1457,0.97,12378.966,12405.526,We were last before you in 2019 to renew the program . We want to move forward with legislation locally this year to be able to respond to time sensitive and required changes.,363,,
1458,0.97,12405.526,12418.372,We also want to move forward with a resolution for priorities in 2023.,363,,
1459,0.97,12418.372,12430.885,"Just as a quick overview, here are the changes made to the Rcw Rcw.",363,,
1460,0.97,12430.885,12520.241,"It now allows local jurisdictions to offer a 12- month extension . This is an option for an extension . Our approach is one to move forward with legislation to accommodate these changes, specifically to allow an extension option for projects that are expiring in 2022 and we'll be back in 2023 to address any extensions at that time.",363,,
1461,0.97,12520.241,12529.116,We also have a resolution with the intent to address other problematic priorities during renewal.,363,,
1462,0.97,12529.116,12548.335,There are nine market rate projects expiring in the next few years and those are units with no other extensions.,363,,
1463,0.97,12548.335,12575.329,"The proposed Affordability levels for the extension are lower than what is currently required for new project Spender program 6 because in general, the older buildings have lower rent as opposed to newer buildings on the market.",363,,
1464,0.97,12575.329,12593.881,"We will increase the pension the projects already in the pipeline, and we recognize that this is a pretty narrow piece of legislation and there are other priorities and issues the city wants to address.",363,,
1465,0.97,12593.881,12610.23,Those are a little bit difficult to address right now.,363,,
1466,0.97,12630.951,12648.802,There's a survey as well for contractors that participate to collect information on apprenticeship utilization.,363,,
1467,0.97,12648.802,12649.236,I will stop there.,363,,
1468,0.97,12649.236,12649.47,Thank you.,363,,
1469,0.97,12676.63,12679.6,I'm excited about the legislation as described.,364,,
1470,0.97,12679.6,12689.143,I think this is an important opportunity for us to continue to put forward proposals and the annual report is very helpful.,364,,
1471,0.97,12689.143,12724.912,"If you have not taken a look at this in detail, I encourage you to look at that as we look at the possible legislation, a partnership with our state partners who have spent the last session expanding these so we don't have expiring units in the moment people are facing Eviction.",364,,
1472,0.97,12724.912,12736.423,We need to build that housing now and this is an important component among many different policies to help us create additional housing.,364,,
1473,0.97,12736.423,12743.497,This will settle the stage for in-depth discussions that will possibly be happening later.,364,,
1474,0.97,12770.657,12782.803,Many expiring units this legislation would stop from expiring?,364,,
1475,0.97,12782.803,12785.072,This legislation only covers expiring in 2021 and 2022.,365,,
1476,0.97,12785.072,12790.677,With that we would invest during program renewal in 2023.,365,,
1477,0.97,12790.677,12799.686,"There are nine market rate properties, 350 units expiring in the next two years.",365,,
1478,0.97,12799.686,12800.287,Thank you.,366,,
1479,0.97,12800.287,12828.015,"A follow-up question, I understand the proposal is to have Affordability levels for old buildings? some more than what is required under six, is there a slide in here that shows the difference between the newer program six buildings and the older program six buildings?",366,,
1480,0.97,12828.015,12832.753,You Affordability levels we proposed?,366,,
1481,0.97,12832.753,12841.528,"Let me--no, there's nothing I can provide that to you as a follow-up but there is not a slide that addresses that specific question so I would be happy to do that.",367,,
1482,0.97,12841.528,12841.929,Okay.,368,,
1483,0.97,12841.929,12844.965,I would love to have the information about that difference.,368,,
1484,0.97,12844.965,12877.864,"And Lastly, I have on occasion inquired for an analysis of what it would cost for the city to use funding to buy down the affordable units that are set to expire and compare what that would cost the city to the revenue that the city loses associated with Nfte.",368,,
1485,0.97,12877.864,12879.099,Nfte results in some revenue being foregone.,368,,
1486,0.97,12879.099,12884.771,Not collect did and some being redistributed to other taxpayers.,368,,
1487,0.97,12884.771,12914.001,"I just want to know that we are achieving our Affordability goals in the most Cost- effective way, and if it is the last expensive to the city to no longer have a tax exemption, but instead, to actually provide funding to buy down these units, that is kind of a Cost-Benefit analysis I would like us to be able to consider.",368,,
1488,0.97,12914.001,12914.268,Thanks.,368,,
1489,0.97,12914.268,12917.104,Thank you.,369,,
