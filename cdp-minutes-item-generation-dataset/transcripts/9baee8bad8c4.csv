33,0.97,387.787,402.201,This is great timing we are having a conversation about the resolution as we jump into the meat of the actual Federal bill that will direct how we as a city want to respond and deploy dollars with urgency.,8,,
34,0.97,402.201,408.307,I will turn to your first but instead of jumping into the presentation we can have folks introduce themselves for the record.,8,,

41,0.97,445.411,455.822,All right so we're going to just do a quick Recap as we discussed a draft of the resolution a couple weeks ago.,14,,
42,0.97,455.822,465.565,Know we have the introduced version that incorporates feedback from a number of Councilmembers.,14,,
43,0.97,465.565,478.177,So we can go to the next slide to discuss the Overarching guiding principles that frame everything that is contained within this resolution.,14,,
44,0.97,478.177,497.063,"First and foremost being equity, acknowledging that the Latinx and communities have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic and these are represented in the front-line workforce and are more likely to be exposed to covert.",14,,
45,0.97,497.063,501.701,This about ensuring investments in these communities is a top priority for this funding.,14,,
46,0.97,501.701,515.715,The next principal would be coordination and the principal acknowledges the city is one of many entities addressing this crisis and it should use the Federal dollars to fill in any service gaps.,14,,
47,0.97,515.715,549.315,"Flexibility that the city should be nimble and prepared to adjust its strategy as necessary to maximize its response to any emergent needs and finally resilience, the Federal funds should be used where possible to help bar against future uncertainty to make sure cities make investments in housing, equitable development initiatives and the green new deal for Seattle as described in the Jumpstart spending plan.",14,,
48,0.97,549.315,553.152,We can go to the next slide.,14,,
49,0.97,553.152,562.528,So we will not describe all 33 spending priorities included in the resolution but we will NOTE they are grouped under the general categories as listed on the slide.,14,,
50,0.97,562.528,575.841,Starting with background from the Councilmembers we have added two new categories to the draft so all the same except the new categories are transportation and community well-being.,14,,
51,0.97,575.841,578.978,Since we discussed the draft two weeks ago.,14,,
52,0.97,578.978,611.277,"The priorities involve the nature of the city response to the Panama, many included priorities would continue the existing relief efforts such as food and rental assistance programs and others focus on made or long-term efforts to help Seattle recover and grow in a more equitable way such as investing in Multimodal infrastructure, more options for Childcare and employment information with apprenticeship opportunities for young people.",14,,
53,0.97,611.277,621.687,"With that I'm happy to entertain any questions, otherwise I can hand it over to Amy who has one amendment to represent.",14,,
54,0.97,621.687,625.925,Thank you very much.,15,,
55,0.97,625.925,630.129,Looking to see if there are any questions.,15,,
56,0.97,630.129,631.998,A few comments before we discuss the amendment.,15,,
57,0.97,631.998,637.503,I want to thank all of you colleagues for the base bill summarized.,15,,
58,0.97,637.503,652.118,This is a reflection of what we currently understand are some of the priority investments that could be possible categories as we look at the draft and the final version that came out of Congress.,15,,
59,0.97,652.118,674.673,We have been working hard on this behind the scenes with all of you and publicly to make sure folks knew what the draft was going to look like and here we have the introduced resolution that incorporates various items to make sure the full Council had a chance to provide comments and priorities in this draft.,15,,
60,0.97,674.673,695.861,"As a reminder this is about making sure we have both Near- term and long-term goals as we look at Seattle workers, residents, small businesses, the most vulnerable getting support they need now to recover from Covid and in coming up years.",15,,
61,0.97,695.861,701.5,My hope and the goal with the resolution is that we begin the process of working on a more detailed appropriations bill that we will be discussing soon.,15,,
62,0.97,701.5,711.677,Following the presentation from item number two and we will have more to say in terms of the scope of the process and the Timeline on agenda item number two.,15,,
63,0.97,711.677,715.314,I'm really thankful for central staff's work on this.,15,,
64,0.97,715.314,730.83,"Yolanda, your presentation and the Email you sent around on March 1 really highlighted how these priorities came from robust conversations that we have had directly with community partners over the years.",15,,
65,0.97,730.83,739.739,"As we created the 2020 budget revisions, the Jumpstart Covid relief plan and as we created the 2021 adopted budget.",15,,
66,0.97,739.739,748.614,All of those conversations with various Stakeholders and directly impacted communities have helped inform the principals in the resolution today.,15,,
67,0.97,748.614,769.668,"Keeping in mind those principles you talked about and priorities for having long-term recovery efforts coupled with acute emergency relief is critical, the potential to leverage other local state and Federal programs and partners trying to respond to Covid is baked into this resolution.",15,,
68,0.97,769.668,784.85,The ability to make sure we were looking at and cognizant of city capacity and addressing restraints that are imposed as we try to be responsive to the need to shrink certain services and expand others.,15,,
69,0.97,784.85,795.261,We really need to look at ways to expand various services if we're going to reach the most vulnerable population and do that equitably.,15,,
70,0.97,795.261,822.621,"So to me the principles you outlined in this presentation of equity, coordination, Resiliene, flexibility they all help to ensure we are coupling this visionary document with past efforts that the Council has put together and prepares us for the conversations we will have soon about the appropriations bill and hopefully a strong partnership with the executive to deploy those resources quickly.",15,,
71,0.97,822.621,825.724,I want to thank you for the work you have done.,15,,
72,0.97,825.724,837.736,"I know this is just the tip of the iceberg as we work on the bills that are coming in, and there could be potential Portioning of the various tranches.",15,,
73,0.97,837.736,838.504,Any questions?,15,,

77,0.97,858.29,883.148,"There is one amendment proposed to the resolution sponsored by Councilmember Herbold, the amendment would add a new subsection under heading get you which is community well-being and the subsection would specify investment in Gender-Based violence response services are priority for Council and with that I will turn it over to Councilmember Herbold to describe more fully.",18,,

81,0.97,904.169,916.916,I learned about this upcoming and likely funding gap on the domestic violence Council which I am a member of.,20,,
82,0.97,916.916,940.239,"We know that the impact of Covid on victims of sexual assault has shown that survivors are struggling with increased acute mental health problems, financial losses, housing instability and lack of access to support services associated with Covid.",20,,
83,0.97,940.239,949.248,Those findings are demonstrated in a recent statewide survey that I know we all received.,20,,
84,0.97,949.248,970.336,"Communities of color, immigrants and refugees are more significantly affected and of course there are technical barriers including fear seeking for an exam in emergency departments during Covid, lack of privacy to participate in Telehealth or to seek crisis care.",20,,
85,0.97,970.336,981.947,Technological barriers to securing protection orders Online and the inability of children to report abuse to a trusted adult outside the home.,20,,

151,0.97,1474.94,1477.676,Next slide.,35,,
152,0.97,1477.676,1495.26,"Last week, Congress approved a $1.9 trillion appropriation bill for additional relief as the country continues to work to address the impacts of Covid- 19 on the economy, public health, state and local governments, individuals and businesses.",35,,
153,0.97,1495.26,1504.402,This highlights the different categories or sections of the bill but we will not be going into detail.,35,,
154,0.97,1504.402,1506.805,Have included it for the next slide please.,35,,
155,0.97,1506.805,1529.127,"Will not spend a lot of time talking about the individual or household support provided through the bill that we did want to highlight some of the pieces of the package that provide relief to those households so things like direct financial assistance, extension of unemployment benefits through early September or increasing the earned income tax credit.",35,,
156,0.97,1529.127,1533.098,Next slide please.,35,,
157,0.97,1533.098,1553.351,I think that the exciting part that this bill offers is the ways in which the direct aid is coupled with additional services that will have a direct impact and we'll talk more about that going forward.,36,,
158,0.97,1553.351,1565.664,"One of the things that's important to highlight is how this does have cash assistance as you have outlined but I wanted to lift up the last line, the funding for vaccines.",36,,
159,0.97,1565.664,1583.181,I know this has been a tremendous Stressor for families figuring out how to access quick and accessible care and funding directly to those health clinics and services through state programs like apple health.,36,,
160,0.97,1583.181,1590.689,This will have a tremendous impact on families dealing with stress and I think that is a direct individual impact.,36,,
161,0.97,1590.689,1610.809,"Small business support, we featured child assistance and the fact that there are so many families potentially lifted out of poverty with new legislation expected to see 14 million Americans lifted out of poverty including 5.7 million children.",36,,
162,0.97,1610.809,1618.516,So the sheer magnitude of what the bill could do is impressive.,36,,
163,0.97,1618.516,1646.511,When I was working on apple health for kids which is the Medicaid expansion at the time it was hailed as one of the largest civil rights bills at the time in Congress and this is parallel if not bigger given the magnitude of how this can help address the near-term prices but has the potential to set the ground to level the playing field to get folks out of generational poverty if we can continue and sustain these investments.,36,,
164,0.97,1646.511,1669.367,Excited about the individual household support and the way other programs are truly going to provide the ongoing Wraparound care to hopefully provide less stress for those in poverty and from the stress of having lack of access to critical support services that contribute to the social determinants of health.,36,,
165,0.97,1669.367,1673.038,Thank you.,37,,
166,0.97,1673.038,1681.346,The next category describes the direct aid to local government included in the package.,37,,
167,0.97,1681.346,1684.582,$130 billion to support local government.,37,,
168,0.97,1684.582,1712.41,"Seattle is anticipating $239 million of direct aid distributed in two tranches, one quickly within 60 days after signing so by May 10 we should be receiving a check in the second tranche no sooner than 12 months after the first is distributed at earliest likely April or may of 2022 for the second half of the direct aid.",37,,
169,0.97,1712.41,1722.187,And then there is flexibility to use these funds for the eligible use through 2024.,37,,
170,0.97,1722.187,1733.932,"I will NOTE because this came up in previous conversations on anticipated Federal aid related to the county, the estimate for the county is 430, $437 million of direct aid.",37,,
171,0.97,1733.932,1756.054,"I note that in part as Yolanda highlighted the principles described in the resolution regarding Federal funding, one piece highlighted is coordination with partner agencies looking out to best leverage and maximize City resources to support other efforts going on in the region.",37,,
172,0.97,1756.054,1774.372,"So, they use for the direct aid is fairly flexible, it can be used in Covid response efforts including responding to the health emergency, that includes assistance for households, small businesses and Nonprofits were impacted industries.",37,,
173,0.97,1774.372,1780.478,It can be used to provide premium pay to city workers or provide grants to eligible employers who perform essential work.,37,,
174,0.97,1780.478,1787.552,And to support general government services in the amount relative to the extent of pandemic induced revenue loss.,37,,
175,0.97,1787.552,1804.803,Essentially that means looking at what the revenues were Pre- pandemic so 2019 revenues and what the current revenues look like now and Backfilling to support certain services to ensure we have continuity of service.,37,,
176,0.97,1804.803,1812.11,"And finally to make the necessary investments in water, sewer or Broadband infrastructure.",37,,
177,0.97,1812.11,1815.413,Next slide please.,37,,
178,0.97,1815.413,1825.123,The remainder of the presentation will focus on the spending priorities by categories and how that relates to the targeted aid included in the package.,37,,
179,0.97,1825.123,1837.302,This light is a reminder for the priority spending categories that were described and approved by the committee in resolution 31 999.,37,,
180,0.97,1837.302,1842.207,Next slide please.,37,,
181,0.97,1842.207,1845.443,This is meant to serve as a guide for how to read slides nine through 19.,37,,
182,0.97,1845.443,1863.361,What we have done is we try to identify where there is targeted aid including in the package in the Federal package supporting investments in the same or similar priorities categories identified by the Council in resolution 31999.,37,,
183,0.97,1863.361,1874.272,The purposes of this exercise is to help you balance how to Prioritize the use of the direct aid and where there may be targeted for the same spending priorities.,37,,
184,0.97,1874.272,1898.663,"This is a work in progress, it's going to take some time before there is additional guidance on how and when this will flow and where there may be gaps . I will not go into great detail on some of the categories but we will highlight where we think there may be overlap between the Council priorities and some of the targeted aid funding buckets.",37,,
185,0.97,1898.663,1918.216,Those priorities where we have not identified targeted eight that can support the same or similar efforts in the city is one consideration for how you may Prioritize the use of some direct aid funds but we will need to do additional analysis to ensure any specific spending priority is eligible use for that direct aid.,37,,
186,0.97,1918.216,1925.69,As the conversations evolve we will continue to narrow and Fine-Tune the process.,37,,
187,0.97,1925.69,1935.099,"All of central stuff, you will have put this presentation together in a very fast Timeline and have made a very digestible.",38,,
188,0.97,1935.099,1950.848,Really appreciate the outline coupling the priorities with what we know so far in the American recovery act making it easy for us and the team to understand but also for the general public.,38,,
189,0.97,1950.848,1955.72,Thank you very much for the helpful Walk-Through and the layout of the presentation today.,38,,
190,0.97,1955.72,1960.224,Very impressive.,38,,
191,0.97,1960.224,1961.259,"Thank you, appreciate that.",39,,
192,0.97,1961.259,1965.063,We're trying to comb through but we may have missed some things.,39,,
193,0.97,1965.063,1975.34,The first spending categories we will talk about Andy's track in order of the spending priority categories in resolution are vaccines and testing.,39,,
194,0.97,1975.34,1998.396,There are a couple buckets of targeted aid targeting those efforts but it is not entirely clear how the money will flow and if there are funding gaps to make sure the principles and activities described in the resolution adopted by Council the highlighted principles and priorities for how vaccine should be distributed are adequately funded.,39,,
195,0.97,1998.396,2019.917,"As more information is available we will better understand the resources can support those efforts like which access, transportation, testing, information and that sort of thing but there are specific resources for vaccine distribution and continue testing, contact tracing and data solutions.",39,,
196,0.97,2019.917,2033.531,Has you covered on slide five the city portion of the expected support from the Federal relief package is expected to be $239 million.,40,,
197,0.97,2033.531,2044.342,Is there any way to extrapolate what that portion of the National figures will mean specific for the city or is that information to be determined?,40,,
198,0.97,2044.342,2046.344,That is information to be determined.,41,,
199,0.97,2046.344,2052.65,With much of the targeted aid it will not flow directly through the city.,41,,
200,0.97,2052.65,2059.957,A lot of it will end up being distributed directly through state or county agencies.,41,,
201,0.97,2059.957,2083.081,"So that is some of what we need to sort out and better understand which is what you will hear us continue to say providing some flexibility as you consider appropriations is likely necessary so we can adjust, the city can adjust its response as we learn more if there is for example County funding to support a specific strategy.",41,,
202,0.97,2083.081,2100.898,"We may better leverage City resources in some other needed space given the magnitude of the need is so great, we will need to be flexible and agile as we make decisions about how to spend the direct aid.",41,,
203,0.97,2100.898,2128.226,"Next slide . in the food space there is no targeted aid identified for programs like the emergency grocery voucher program that was stood up early in the city Covid response or new programs that would, as described in the resolution those that would partner with local farms and food entrepreneurs to provide meals.",41,,
204,0.97,2128.226,2134.298,The 2021 adopted budget only funded the emergency program through April of this year.,41,,
205,0.97,2134.298,2145.243,The Office of Sustainability and environment is Ramping the program down and the program has run on a bit of a shoestring with existing staff and no administrative resources.,41,,
206,0.97,2145.243,2171.669,Continuing would require what the resources would need to relaunch the program and this is one area where the Council may want to consider how the city is providing financial assistance to support households who may need more flexibility in use of the funds going from groceries to gas for their car to get to work and those sorts of things.,41,,
207,0.97,2171.669,2176.574,So that is a piece we will be looking into further.,41,,
208,0.97,2176.574,2182.647,Unless there are questions I will go to the next slide.,41,,
209,0.97,2182.647,2186.884,Sweat actually can I make a statement?,41,,
210,0.97,2186.884,2213.911,"Is part of the assumption potentially that went into the congressional bill the effort to say if there is additional cash support families are in a position to make decisions about whether or not that is money they need for food assistance or if it is money they are needing for parental support, is the part of the Calculus?",41,,
211,0.97,2213.911,2215.446,Have you heard anything about that?,41,,
212,0.97,2215.446,2236.233,"I have not heard specific things for the Federal level by getting at what we were describing, it is sort of both and like the city is currently providing emergency voucher program and provides funding for food banks and other food service industries moving forward.",42,,
213,0.97,2236.233,2256.754,"Suing the Federal space they are doing things like increasing funding for snap benefits, extending the Ebt program and increasing funding for and the direct cash assistance for families to determine what their needs are.",42,,
214,0.97,2256.754,2263.06,So I think we are getting at the same thing.,42,,
215,0.97,2263.06,2263.461,All right.,42,,
216,0.97,2263.461,2279.944,"In the homelessness and housing services spending priority, there are several areas where there are targeted funds for things like rental assistance including utilities, Eviction production and foreclosure prevention as well as Internet service costs.",42,,
217,0.97,2279.944,2302.3,"It is not yet clear if the targeted aid for example for rental assistance is available to be used for things like Internet service cost, the language in the bill is a little vague so as additional guidance is released we will better understand the funds can be used for and whether or not there are gaps in the types of support households might need.",42,,
218,0.97,2302.3,2306.704,Next slide please.,42,,
219,0.97,2306.704,2323.788,"Similarly, there is funding in the bill would targeted aid for shelter and housing services which includes the potential for building acquisition however we have not identified anything that would specifically support hygiene services.",42,,
220,0.97,2323.788,2330.327,That support people expensing homelessness in the city.,42,,
221,0.97,2330.327,2348.612,"That reminds me that at some point we should follow up about the lack of spending the dollars that the Council appropriated already for facilities, I know Councilmember Gonzalez is having conversations with folks in the Department this week.",43,,
222,0.97,2348.612,2363.427,"Especially if it's not called out in the Federal bill, we have already funded Handwashing facilities and getting those deployed with urgency is needed given that it was five months ago the council passed that spending authorization.",43,,
223,0.97,2363.427,2384.081,"Appreciate you highlighting that and I think that underscores the ongoing need to make sure the dollars that the city council authorized are being used, I will look forward to an update and sharing it and I'm sure Councilmember Morales will Ãšshare as well but we would like to make sure that goes forward.",43,,
224,0.97,2384.081,2388.586,"Okay, next slide.",44,,
225,0.97,2388.586,2425.422,In the immigrant and refugee support category we have not identified any specific targeted aid to support immigrant and refugee residents as recently presented by the immigrant affairs the money authorized for the Jumpstart Covid relief plan to provide assistance to low income immigrant refugees was quickly distributed was only for financial assistance to 20% of the applicants so this is an area we wanted to flag as the city council is considering how to use the direct aid.,44,,
226,0.97,2425.422,2447.945,"To ensure access to the various ways targeted aid will be distributed, ensuring support for language access services may be a significant need to help connect small business owners to the resources that may be available through the small business SBA and that sort of thing.",44,,
227,0.97,2447.945,2454.251,Can I ask a question to clarify a finer point.,45,,
228,0.97,2454.251,2477.374,"There may not be targeted dates, I'm sorry, I know we have only been sitting with the bill for a few days so please don't feel like you have to be an expert but I will say I think in some of the comments I have heard from congressional members, they were proud that there were not prohibitions on how the aide could be used.",45,,
229,0.97,2477.374,2485.483,So making it possible for many immigrant and refugee neighbors and community members to be recipients of funds.,45,,
230,0.97,2485.483,2490.187,Allowing more people to have access to the funds that were not previously eligible last year is that a fair statement?,45,,
231,0.97,2490.187,2525.523,I have heard the same thing so I will take the opportunity to say this is the initial reach and have not identified specific buckets of money for that but not to say that individual targeted programs would not allow for use of funds to ensure access and greater availability of the funds to support a broad population of people who need support so that is one of the things we are Sorting out.,46,,
232,0.97,2525.523,2526.29,Okay.,46,,
233,0.97,2526.29,2528.125,Moving on.,46,,
234,0.97,2528.125,2557.221,"There is funding in the Federal package to the Childcare and development block care grant program and stabilization grant that appears to be fairly flexible for Childcare providers including funding that can be used to bring new people in to the child care industry, new workers but there does not appear to be targeted dates to support development of new Childcare centers.",46,,
235,0.97,2557.221,2569.166,It is not clear to us yet if the direct aid could be used for that purpose but we will continue to look into that to understand how the Federal money may support this priority.,46,,
236,0.97,2569.166,2574.672,Next slide please.,46,,
237,0.97,2574.672,2598.462,In the small business worker assistance and workforce recovery spending category there are different ways that a small business will be supported through targeted aid but again it is not clear there are resources specifically to ensure there will be technical in language support for small businesses and nonprofit organizations to access those resources.,46,,
238,0.97,2598.462,2620.417,Over the last year the office of economic development has deployed resources for technical assistance as well as other city departments to support language access and those types of services which may be a gap that the city may continue to need to fill in on but that is not yet totally clear to us.,46,,
239,0.97,2620.417,2626.89,Next slide please.,46,,
240,0.97,2626.89,2630.327,In addition this is the second of two slides in this category.,46,,
241,0.97,2630.327,2636.433,There are a number of spending priorities for small businesses.,46,,
242,0.97,2636.433,2649.046,"To support workers, when I say small businesses, that includes nonprofit organizations and there is some focus on certain creative industries, restaurants and bars and other specific employers.",46,,
243,0.97,2649.046,2663.027,In this space around supporting workers directly or workforce recovery efforts we have not yet identified any specific targeted aid for those purposes.,46,,
244,0.97,2663.027,2665.863,Okay.,46,,
245,0.97,2665.863,2668.565,Next slide.,46,,
246,0.97,2668.565,2684.381,"Community well-being, this is a Catchall category where we have identified targeted aid for things like where we have not identified targeted aid for essential household needs or hate violence response.",46,,
247,0.97,2684.381,2695.192,"I will note, not called out specifically we have highlighted some targeted aid focusing on Internet access, mental health and substance abuse services and funding for critical infrastructure.",46,,
248,0.97,2695.192,2709.573,I would NOTE not listed there are funds in the Federal package within the Medicaid section giving the state the option to provide Community- based mobile intervention services.,46,,
249,0.97,2709.573,2719.316,We are not clear on what that means or how the money will flow but I wanted to note in response to the question I had on the presentation.,46,,
250,0.97,2719.316,2721.318,Next slide please.,46,,
251,0.97,2721.318,2729.093,"In the transportation category, there is targeted aid to support transit service and transportation infrastructure.",46,,
252,0.97,2729.093,2743.307,It is not clear there are specific funds targeted aid to encourage walking rolling and liking so that's one area we will be looking into further.,46,,
253,0.97,2743.307,2744.241,And then.,46,,
254,0.97,2744.241,2752.649,"Sorry, a quick question.",47,,
255,0.97,2752.649,2755.452,Can you tell us a little bit more about the targeted aid and transportation?,47,,
256,0.97,2755.452,2765.229,Some folks might ask how does this fit into immediate Covid recovery effort and there is specific language so can you tell us more about the sideboards on that?,47,,
257,0.97,2765.229,2770.734,I don't have a lot of details but we can follow up with more information.,48,,
258,0.97,2770.734,2780.677,In general one of the recovery responses is ensuring essential workers can continue to get to and from work.,48,,
259,0.97,2780.677,2803.0,"As we look to reopening, providing safe and accessible transit is going to be critical to the city response efforts including as people are discussing use of right away that has been more creatively considered during the pandemic I think discussions around transit investments will become Evermore critical.",48,,
260,0.97,2803.0,2804.868,We will follow up when we know more.,48,,
261,0.97,2804.868,2809.306,"That is helpful, thank you.",49,,
262,0.97,2809.306,2815.679,The final category in the resolution is related to revenue replacement and financial resiliency.,50,,
263,0.97,2815.679,2827.391,We have highlighted there is no specific targeted aid for this category but it is a potential eligible use of direct aid.,50,,
264,0.97,2827.391,2846.31,We have added some information related to the 2020 revised and 2021 adopted budget about the use of city reserves to Rebalance 2020 and a balance the 2021 adopted budget that was needed to support general government services and specific Covid response efforts.,50,,
265,0.97,2846.31,2867.631,The general fund revenues are projected to be down compared to Pre-Pandemic levels so this information will hopefully be useful as you consider short and long-term decisions related to the use of direct aid this year and consideration of next year's budget and future years.,50,,
266,0.97,2867.631,2872.869,Again pointing back to slide six the third bullet for folks that are following.,51,,
267,0.97,2872.869,2887.951,Noting that eligible use includes direct aid for the provision of government services to the extent of the reduction in revenue relative to the revenue collected in the most recent full fiscal year prior to the emergency.,51,,
268,0.97,2887.951,2906.203,So not applicable is there in terms of the targeted called out to find a list but it is a eligible use as we think about the impact in declining revenue as a result of the consequences of Covid on the local economy is that correct?,51,,
269,0.97,2906.203,2911.074,That is correct.,52,,
270,0.97,2911.074,2917.214,Okay.,53,,
271,0.97,2917.214,2939.536,"Okay, and finally, moving on to the next steps we, central staff will be working with all of you and with the city budget office to continue to seek clarity on how and when targeted aid will be distributed.",54,,
272,0.97,2939.536,2947.644,What resources may be provided by the state and where there may be gaps in services supported by directed.,54,,
273,0.97,2947.644,2960.857,Will be putting information together to understand if additional resources are needed to support reopening cost including Revisiting assumptions in the 2021 adopted budget about the timing on reopening.,54,,
274,0.97,2960.857,2977.941,"In some cases and parks for example we were not sure when we would be able to fully reopen those sorts of things, as we learn more with Vaccinations becoming more distributed there may be a need to Revisit those assumptions and provide additional resources to support reopening.",54,,
275,0.97,2977.941,2991.154,As well as how the direct aid may be needed to ensure continuity of service in future years that otherwise may be reduced due to the projected ongoing pandemic induced based revenue losses.,54,,
276,0.97,2991.154,3019.383,"It is likely information and clarification on how and when the targeted date will be distributed and what it can be used for that will evolve over time, the Council may want to consider providing some flexibility to departments on spending to allow for programmatic adjustments in response to new information about the targeted aid and to support local needs and changing program response needs.",54,,
277,0.97,3019.383,3070.967,"In terms of timing we are working with the budget chair as described in the briefing yesterday to put together a more detailed schedule that we will be distributing when we have the details but generally speaking following today's discussion we will be working with all of you, with your other Council colleagues and with the executives to develop a spending plan with the goal of introducing legislation in April and taking action by early to mid may, this Timeline could include taking up one appropriation bill for each tranche of the aid to ensure that services that may need immediate funding are supported quickly and then taking more time to make other decisions about the direct aid that will be provided in 2021.",54,,
278,0.97,3070.967,3086.583,Again we will provide more details and likely request proposals from Councilmembers by a date as we sort out those details with the budget chair.,54,,
279,0.97,3086.583,3088.418,"With that, that is the end of my presentation.",54,,
280,0.97,3088.418,3091.088,Happy to take questions.,54,,
281,0.97,3091.088,3092.088,Thank you very much.,55,,
282,0.97,3092.088,3094.157,I know this is a lot of information.,55,,
283,0.97,3094.157,3097.16,This is also the beginning of our conversation.,55,,
284,0.97,3097.16,3145.709,"To reiterate some of the time when peace is mentioned over the next 6 to 8 weeks we are going to be building a plan for allocating direct aid that the city will receive from the American recovery act plan to support Covid response, providing time to work with Stakeholders and consider best use of resources so the city can continue to deliver the critical services that we have already lifted up and invested in as we respond to Covid and to make sure we're thinking about how to best be positioned and prepare to whether the future economic uncertainty that Covid has exacerbated as we think about long-term recovery efforts.",55,,
285,0.97,3145.709,3156.453,"Central staff, as you heard is working really fast and very hard and I want to thank members of the city budget office as well who have been working to compare notes.",55,,
286,0.97,3156.453,3171.468,Will continue to build off the resolution that you all approved moments ago with resolution 31999 and folding spending priorities into a appropriation subordinate's.,55,,
287,0.97,3171.468,3179.175,Today's discussion is not over so have a chance to hear more questions or identify areas you would like central staff to look into.,55,,
288,0.97,3179.175,3190.186,Following today's discussion we will be developing this spending proposal with the goal of introduction I am hoping to have in the committee April 6.,55,,
289,0.97,3190.186,3200.363,Early April would be the next meeting so that's three weeks from now to get into the details and identify strategies to allocate funding very quickly.,55,,
290,0.97,3200.363,3207.47,"There are two tranches, one comes now and another coming in 12 months.",55,,
291,0.97,3207.47,3225.922,The way I like to think about this is putting just tranche one in front of us and identifying if we need to Bifurcate certain dollars we can do that now given the immediate feedback and direction we have from our congressional leaders and from the Federal administration.,55,,
292,0.97,3225.922,3232.429,If there is a possibility to move quicker on a set of dollars within tranche one we will bring that to you.,55,,
293,0.97,3232.429,3243.139,If we can move all of it then great I think there is a likelihood you want to think about maybe two waves of allocating tranche one.,55,,
294,0.97,3243.139,3249.913,And then I look forward to more information as we receive it from central staff.,55,,
295,0.97,3249.913,3286.683,Ultimately all of us are going to be having the opportunity to engage in this conversation over the two meetings in April and either one or two meetings in May with the goal of passing this before June because some of the programs we have provided assistance for using Federal dollars to have a shelf life that ends in June so we want to act prior to June ideally with as much advanced notice to the Department so there is no gaps in services and the Department has sufficient time to address programs to make necessary changes.,55,,
296,0.97,3286.683,3297.093,I look forward to working with all of you to make sure the priorities we have talked about in the resolution are reflected in the appropriations bill.,55,,
297,0.97,3297.093,3325.689,I know we just came off a year of ongoing budget deliberation so we appreciate your time in advance and I look forward to working with you and central staff to develop more of a retail detailed schedule and we will be working in coordination with the Council President office to make sure everybody knows what the schedule is and we want to continue to pull in colleagues who are not on the budget committee so there are conversations we will have with you over the next few weeks about how to make that possible.,55,,
298,0.97,3325.689,3348.044,"Want to reiterate all Councilmembers including those not on the budget committee sorry not on the housing and Finance Committee which is different from the select budget committee, all colleagues have been able to provide feedback to the resolution in front of us and we are working on a plan now and we will be working with the central staff to talk about how all the Councilmembers can provide feedback into the ordinance coming forward.",55,,
299,0.97,3348.044,3350.647,Council President I owe you a call.,55,,
300,0.97,3350.647,3362.759,If we were in person obviously we would all have more updates in real-time but I want to make sure we connect well about the possibility going forward.,55,,
301,0.97,3362.759,3367.263,Any questions on central staff's presentation?,55,,
302,0.97,3367.263,3369.365,The overview?,55,,
303,0.97,3369.365,3370.834,I want to note how impressive this is.,55,,
304,0.97,3370.834,3397.794,"You pulled in information from the League of cities, from providing information directly from the Federal summary documents about what is in the bill, very much appreciate you condensing the information and making it digestible and relating back to the Council priorities that have already been outlined in the resolution.",55,,
305,0.97,3397.794,3401.197,So thank you.,55,,
306,0.97,3401.197,3409.172,I'm not seeing any additional questions which means you did a tremendous job.,55,,
307,0.97,3409.172,3410.807,Thank you very much for providing this information.,55,,
308,0.97,3410.807,3427.023,Colleagues if there is no additional questions thank you for staying tuned and will follow up with you in terms of next steps and a lot of action is anticipated over the next 3 to 4 meetings so thank you again in advance.,55,,
309,0.97,3427.023,3429.025,Let's move on to our third item of business.,55,,
310,0.97,3429.025,3432.328,Madam clerk please read item 3 into the record.,55,,
311,0.97,3432.328,3459.155,"Agenda item number three, council bill 120019 ordinance amending ordinance 126 237 adopting the 2021 budget including the capital improvement program changing the appropriations to various departments and budget control levels and for various funds in the budget for briefing, discussion and possible vote.",56,,

313,0.97,3460.156,3462.358,With us we have Jeff Simms from central staff.,57,,

315,0.97,3464.027,3467.664,Jeff Simms central staff.,58,,
316,0.97,3467.664,3483.68,I'm going to ask if you would like to have opening remarks on the item and then I'll have some comments as well just to give us a sense of why this is in front of us and the urgency of this legislation.,59,,
317,0.97,3483.68,3488.985,Councilmember Lewis did you have anything to add to this?,59,,
318,0.97,3488.985,3491.588,Thank you Madam chair and thank you for hearing this bill.,60,,
319,0.97,3491.588,3524.32,"For those watching and the general public, this bill is a culmination of several weeks of discussion both within the Council amongst ourselves and the Mayor's office, the city budget office, central staff, external partners and the public discourse in the media around how to pursue a sheltering strategy for those most vulnerable in the pandemic.",60,,
320,0.97,3524.32,3528.324,And take advantage of potential reimbursement from FEMA.,60,,
321,0.97,3528.324,3571.067,"I think Jeff is better positioned to talk to the specifics but I would say I appreciated seeing in the public media yesterday about this the strong support from the Mayor's office, strong support from the city budget office moving forward with this strategy and look forward to discussing this today answering any questions and then seeing what the path forward will be to get this much-needed additional resource out the door and try to take advantage of some opportunities here to make sure we are Scaling up the essential services.",60,,
322,0.97,3571.067,3573.269,So with that I will turn it over to Jeff.,60,,
323,0.97,3573.269,3581.577,"Thank you, before you do, Council President, anything else you would like to offer in terms of context?",61,,
324,0.97,3581.577,3609.172,I think I did want to sort of give a big thank you to Jeff Sims and Aly Pennucci for attending the meeting with FEMA administrators with my office last week and a huge thank you to Councilmember Lewis for getting us to the point where we can have an actionable piece of legislation to continue to advance Council priority in this space.,62,,
325,0.97,3609.172,3618.514,Looking forward to the conversation and to hopefully having an opportunity to add my name is a cosponsor to this really important bill if a sponsor is willing to take additional cosponsors.,62,,
326,0.97,3618.514,3620.416,Thank you.,62,,
327,0.97,3620.416,3623.619,Thank you very much.,63,,
328,0.97,3623.619,3626.923,"Jeff, we want to thank you for your work on this.",63,,
329,0.97,3626.923,3630.126,As you have heard many Councilmembers are appreciative of your work.,63,,
330,0.97,3630.126,3650.246,"I want to thank Councilmember Lewis for his sponsor on this, thankful for the direct engagement with FEMA to get to the bottom of the issues we had been hearing about or barriers to using Federal dollars but also say this is the right thing to do.",63,,
331,0.97,3650.246,3659.822,My office has been engaged in conversations with the Mayor's office since March in partnership with a handful of hotels who at the time one year ago wanted to open their doors with appropriate services provided.,63,,
332,0.97,3659.822,3670.566,"And offer rooms, knowing the crisis we saw has only gotten worse since last March the urgency of the bill cannot be overstated.",63,,
333,0.97,3670.566,3686.315,Very much appreciate your ongoing work to get to the bottom of the Federal guidance and also to help us understand how dollars in the city have been appropriated to city Council and either are or neuron not being deployed so thank you for your work on that.,63,,
334,0.97,3686.315,3708.304,Excited to hear more about the legislation in front of us as we know that the crisis is growing worse and the C test we want people to see relief in the street and I think this is a very positive piece of legislation that will allow people to see a change and experience a change.,63,,
335,0.97,3708.304,3715.211,"So, Jeff with that will turn it over to you and then we will see if there's additional comments or questions.",63,,
336,0.97,3715.211,3717.113,Naked.,64,,
337,0.97,3717.113,3726.823,I will go into specifics as highlighted.,64,,
338,0.97,3726.823,3742.505,"This bill addresses the urgent need to provide Non-Congregants shelter for people experiencing homelessness who are at high risk for Covid-19, preventing further community spread while providing a way for those individuals to practice social distancing and gives those people the option to protect themselves.",64,,
339,0.97,3742.505,3767.864,The bill provides $12 million for the purpose of responding to the urgent need and includes the flexibility for Noncompany shelter either as shelter beds or utilizing a tiny home village where villages or using enhanced shelters like Brick- And-Mortar shelters.,64,,
340,0.97,3767.864,3772.368,"Second, it focuses on people who are at high risk which is the point of the critical need.",64,,
341,0.97,3772.368,3780.076,We are at high risk for severe outcomes and they are homeless.,64,,
342,0.97,3780.076,3794.69,30 calls for using a procurement process and finally if necessary it calls on receiving or obtaining the approval or Preapproval from Federal agencies to pursue the activities and make expenditures that are necessary.,64,,
343,0.97,3794.69,3798.961,As you are aware there has been discussion about FEMA and availability of funding.,64,,
344,0.97,3798.961,3818.281,This does not identify FEMA as the funding source so if the steps outlined were followed it would hopefully make it possible for reimbursement to be one of the potential funding sources to pay for the cost of the associated with this appropriation.,64,,
345,0.97,3818.281,3826.189,With that I do not have further technical pieces so I am happy to turn over to the committee.,64,,
346,0.97,3826.189,3828.424,Thank you very much.,65,,
347,0.97,3828.424,3834.43,"To underscore the importance, $12 million is the possibility we are freeing up with legislation.",65,,
348,0.97,3834.43,3848.144,$12 million not just for hotels but for various Non-Congregants shelter options including tiny hose villages and hotel and strategies along with enhanced shelters.,65,,
349,0.97,3848.144,3870.867,"As folks know shelters have had to De-Intensify, move more folks across different spaces because of the need to socially distance and they are older and insufficient with mats on the floor, the strategy we line people up and have them sleep next to each other and kick them out in the morning.",65,,
350,0.97,3870.867,3880.676,It was not working during Covid and now it is deathly so this is funding we're trying to get for Non-Congregants shelter options and enhanced options across the city.,65,,
351,0.97,3880.676,3884.347,A lot of folks asked why do we see more people outside?,65,,
352,0.97,3884.347,3897.293,"It is because shelters are at capacity, they were at capacity prior to Covid and we have not opened enough shelter especially in the response to have Non-Congregants shelter options within the city.",65,,
353,0.97,3897.293,3929.025,"King County has been doing a tremendous job with helping to hotel folks and provide additional services and the data has shown when people get the individual Non-Congregants shelter options coupled with services that are provided, testimonials have been people saying I was able to keep my job, if folks have been using substances they were able to get sober because they had a place to stay safe and not have to self Medicate.",65,,
354,0.97,3929.025,3934.096,"People talked about mental health improvements, they felt like there was something to live for.",65,,
355,0.97,3934.096,3944.24,This is how we will respond to the crisis of homelessness in the five year declared state of emergency and the public health emergency.,65,,
356,0.97,3944.24,3951.147,Excited about the options listed and if there is Federal funding then great that is the Cherry on top.,65,,
357,0.97,3951.147,3963.159,Wonderful news but this is the right thing to do and I think this is showing the city is ready to move forward finally with making sure there is sufficient Non-Congregants shelter options.,65,,
358,0.97,3963.159,3981.243,"This must be done in addition to opening up additional affordable housing options, as a reminder the Jumpstart passed last year and of the $214 million, $135 million will go to homeless and housing services.",65,,
359,0.97,3981.243,3984.08,"So that is the light at the end of the tunnel, the exit plan.",65,,
360,0.97,3984.08,3993.389,The answer is not just shelters the answer is housing so this creates the option for folks to get into shelters and then get into housing.,65,,
361,0.97,3993.389,4008.404,"I'm really excited about this, I want to thank the sponsor and I want to remind folks because this legislation will be amending the budget we passed the approval will require a 3/4 vote by the full council ultimately.",65,,
362,0.97,4008.404,4010.473,Those are my comments.,65,,
363,0.97,4010.473,4016.312,Any questions for Jeff or comments?,65,,
364,0.97,4016.312,4019.415,Okay Jeff.,65,,
365,0.97,4019.415,4022.685,I'm not seeing any which means you did a tremendous job.,65,,
366,0.97,4022.685,4026.889,Councilmember Lewis any additional comments you would like to say before we wrap this up?,65,,
367,0.97,4026.889,4035.831,"No, I would just say I really appreciate central staff's diligent efforts in Stitching this together.",66,,
368,0.97,4035.831,4052.715,It did go through quite the Iterative process to try to get the wording right and put together a lot of feedback from a lot of different sources which is why the finished product is neatly prepared.,66,,
369,0.97,4052.715,4066.128,"I don't have anything else to add to this, I want to thank Tom Mikesell and Aly Pennucci for their work in getting this together.",66,,
370,0.97,4066.128,4086.882,"Hoping to get it out the door as soon as possible and to again lift up the words of my predecessor Sally back Shaw, make sure we have a very visible see test on a lot of these sheltering initiatives that we are pursuing to meet the scale of the crisis.",66,,
371,0.97,4086.882,4089.185,"Excellent, thank you very much.",67,,
372,0.97,4089.185,4096.358,With that I move the committee recommend passage of Council bill 120019.,67,,

393,0.97,4203.666,4212.408,It is a full team to talk with us about the bill which would provide additional rental assistance.,75,,
394,0.97,4212.408,4218.714,I want to make sure Councilmembers who are part of the committee know that we were very much excited about this legislation to come down.,75,,
395,0.97,4218.714,4236.332,We have not had ample time to suit with it and Tracy I want to make sure you know we respect and appreciate you and we think you are a hero but coming through this and having a conversation with various Councilmembers within the Timeframe we received it was probably not possible.,75,,
396,0.97,4236.332,4241.637,We have this listed today as briefing discussion and possible vote.,75,,
397,0.97,4241.637,4265.828,If there is interest in a vote we can do that but we have not had the opportunity to have been briefed on this yet from central staff because it is important we get this right I will make sure we have the full conversation and I think in recognition of the conversation we had yesterday with the extension of the moratorium we potentially have additional time to consider the legislation in front of us.,75,,
398,0.97,4265.828,4276.372,"Prior, it was really urgent for us to consider and move it out before the end of the month to make sure folks were getting that type of relief.",75,,
399,0.97,4276.372,4289.985,"Again, the rental assistance legislation in front of us and colleagues who are here from various departments are going to provide an overview of the aspects of the bill along with leadership today along with Emily Alvarado when.",75,,

411,0.97,4372.368,4374.069,Okay.,78,,
412,0.97,4374.069,4382.044,Today we are talking about our proposed allocations for Federal funding for emergency rental assistance.,78,,
413,0.97,4382.044,4389.084,We know there are many households who are struggling who have been economically impacted by Covid and are unable to pay their rent.,78,,
414,0.97,4389.084,4417.98,There are many households who already have accumulated that and they owe their landlords resources and even though there now has been an extension in the Eviction moratorium through June 30th we know that families are nervous and they are struggling so we are eager to get rental assistance resources out into the hands of those who need it.,78,,
415,0.97,4417.98,4421.817,"To be clear, this bill is Federal rental assistance that was passed in December.",78,,
416,0.97,4421.817,4441.036,"This is a direct Treasury allocation of $22.7 million for the city of Seattle, this is not the Arp resources that were discussed earlier which will provide additional direct allocation for rental assistance in an amount I am not clear yet what the number is but that is forthcoming.",78,,
417,0.97,4441.036,4454.95,The proposed legislation before you accept the funds and makes allocations for a range of approaches to rental assistance delivery as well as to utility assistance.,78,,
418,0.97,4454.95,4482.344,"This is really building on the framework established to date for our approach to providing Covid-19 emergency rental assistance and you will hear more, the majority of the resource we are proposing to invest in direct rental assistance but there is some utility assistance as well my colleagues from Spu and city light can talk about later.",78,,
419,0.97,4482.344,4492.888,"I mentioned we're building on recent work, as we worked quickly to stand up programs for rental assistance last year which are three primary approaches.",78,,
420,0.97,4492.888,4509.171,"The first was to work with United way of King County as they expanded the Homebase program, they were the first entity to create a portal and application process for direct assistance and has been successful.",78,,
421,0.97,4509.171,4524.419,"Second we were probably the first in the nation to create a public, a special resource for publicly subsidized affordable housing and I really has multiple justifications behind it.",78,,
422,0.97,4524.419,4530.125,One is the approach to target those with the lowest income and a history of housing instability.,78,,
423,0.97,4530.125,4540.235,"We did publicly subsidize investments to stabilize buildings, entire building communities and to support nonprofit operators.",78,,
424,0.97,4540.235,4543.105,And we used Community-Based organizations.,78,,
425,0.97,4543.105,4559.955,In 2020 we leveraged our relationship with existing contracted homelessness prevention providers and you will see we recommend Scaling the investment in Community- based organizations even more.,78,,
426,0.97,4559.955,4569.464,There has been a flurry of national assessment about one of the best approaches and practices in delivering rental assistance.,78,,
427,0.97,4569.464,4571.199,I want to call out two papers.,78,,
428,0.97,4571.199,4577.673,One done by the urban Institute and one done by the Furman center.,78,,
429,0.97,4577.673,4584.579,Both looking at how to not only officially invest resources but how to do so equitably.,78,,
430,0.97,4584.579,4600.896,"From the urban Institute they recommend three priorities, Furman represents five key priorities and I will summarize the with three witches leverage existing systems to the extent possible.",78,,
431,0.97,4600.896,4604.199,Prioritize funding based on need and vulnerability.,78,,
432,0.97,4604.199,4618.814,The roll call from both institutes is to look at how we support the lowest income households and how we are supporting populations hardest hit by both Covid and housing instability.,78,,
433,0.97,4618.814,4624.319,And then both institutes are pushing us to invest in strategies designed to achieve racial equity.,78,,
434,0.97,4624.319,4649.444,"In this case it is clear to say achieving racial equity is not only about looking at the demographics of who is served but also about the community who we are working with and ensuring that there is appropriate language access, outreach and targeting for those strategies.",78,,
435,0.97,4649.444,4654.616,We know that the need for rental assistance is really significant.,78,,
436,0.97,4654.616,4668.83,I am putting out a number that there are some Demographers and statisticians who might not like the way I extrapolated this figure but it is in order of magnitude of how much need there is.,78,,
437,0.97,4668.83,4685.68,"Estimated 13,000 low-income households that are deficient on their rent and for those households we can use national sources corroborated by some local information to show the average household is between 3000 and $5000 on their rent.",78,,
438,0.97,4685.68,4724.619,"In this issue we see very clearly that there are disproportionate impacts of rental, the need for rental assistance based on race while the survey shows 11% of white households report they are not current on rent, 21% of Latino households and 18% of black households report they are not current on rent so the justification to ensure we are focusing on having targeted racial equity strategies to ensure we are meeting the needs of black, Latino and other people of color households.",78,,
439,0.97,4724.619,4746.641,"I will say if you do the quick math with a 13,000 multiplied by $4000 what it concludes is even with this assistance we are not going to meet the needs so the need Outpaces the available resources even with this allocation.",78,,
440,0.97,4746.641,4752.514,So here is the summary slide that shows our proposed funding amounts.,78,,
441,0.97,4752.514,4757.752,"First, we are recommending $8 million to United way of King County.",78,,
442,0.97,4757.752,4759.621,It would be a sub award to them.,78,,
443,0.97,4759.621,4772.033,Kelly will talk more about the partnership with United way but that is really the primary way to direct individuals to centralized tenant pool.,78,,
444,0.97,4772.033,4780.542,We are recommending $7 million to continued investments of publicly subsidized affordable housing.,78,,
445,0.97,4780.542,4788.917,Consistent with national best practices this is one way to ensure we are really focusing on meeting the needs of the lowest income households.,78,,
446,0.97,4788.917,4796.591,Recommending $6.2 million to Community-Based organizations to achieve targeted racial equity outcomes.,78,,
447,0.97,4796.591,4823.919,Looking for these agencies to be trying a lead pub organizations that have experience in serving those who are disproportionately impacted by Covid and by housing instability and the approach would be not only to invest in rental assistance but a that with support services as is needed by the folks who approach these agencies.,78,,
448,0.97,4823.919,4836.198,$1.5 million proposed for allocation for city light and Spu and they can talk more later about their bill paying assistance proposal.,78,,
449,0.97,4836.198,4838.833,So I'm going to turn it over to Kelly.,78,,
450,0.97,4838.833,4845.74,"Great, thank you director Alvarado.",79,,
451,0.97,4845.74,4856.384,Thank you for having us here today we are excited to talk about this work and we want to thank all of our staff and colleagues to make this work reality.,79,,
452,0.97,4856.384,4864.025,We will start by sharing more about the eligible use of funds and follow with more detail about the proposed allocations and strategies.,79,,
453,0.97,4864.025,4882.877,"These funds are issued and regulated by the Department of the Treasury so you can see the funding is intended to serve people who have experienced financial hardship due to Covid- 19, folks at risk of homelessness or housing instability and those at or below 80% of the area median income.",79,,
454,0.97,4882.877,4903.398,"The eligible cost categories are narrow, the singular goal is keeping people in their homes so 90% of funds must be used for direct financial assistance including rent and back rent, utilities and utility back payments and other direct expenses related to housing.",79,,
455,0.97,4903.398,4907.302,10% may be used for housing stability services and Admin.,79,,
456,0.97,4907.302,4910.772,Moving to the first allocation proposal.,79,,
457,0.97,4910.772,4915.176,This proposal provides $8 million to the United way of King County.,79,,
458,0.97,4915.176,4925.587,As you heard this is the individual tenant pool where we would be driving the general public to apply.,79,,
459,0.97,4925.587,4933.695,King County expects to deliver $145 million total for all rental assistance and they will be investing in the strategy.,79,,
460,0.97,4933.695,4942.637,This is coordinated efforts to serve tenants and small landlords.,79,,
461,0.97,4942.637,4953.815,"The city directed funds through this joint effort last year demonstrating strong outcomes, United way worked with a number of groups including the urban League, solid ground and neighborhood house to deliver funds and services to the community.",79,,
462,0.97,4953.815,4967.929,"They did great work serving the priority populations we talked about and over 70% of the households in 2020 were headed by a person who was black, indigenous or a person of color.",79,,
463,0.97,4967.929,4985.547,With the funding from the office of immigrant and refugee affairs we are planning to support smaller community organizations to navigate folks to wear these programs with translation services and we have had preliminary conversation with groups that are interested in providing this support.,79,,
464,0.97,4985.547,4993.355,We have also heard United way reports there are over 2000 households on the Waitlist for the next round of rental assistance.,79,,
465,0.97,4993.355,4999.361,All indicating they are behind on rent which is another indication of the need.,79,,
466,0.97,4999.361,5008.67,"Staff at the city, County and United way are doing program development work to ensure alignment and make sure tenants can easily navigate this program.",79,,
467,0.97,5008.67,5010.305,The second allocation.,79,,
468,0.97,5010.305,5016.978,Providing $7 million for tenants living in publicly subsidized buildings.,79,,
469,0.97,5016.978,5024.319,'s strategy Prioritizes the lowest income households mostly under 30% of area median income.,79,,
470,0.97,5024.319,5038.933,"These are consistently housing folks with lowest incomes and challenging housing 10 years and we feel it is critical to ensure these tenants, buildings and organizations are as stable as possible during this uncertain time.",79,,
471,0.97,5038.933,5050.945,In subsidized housing accumulation up back rent can quickly become a concerning financial situation so that is part of the strategy.,79,,
472,0.97,5050.945,5060.121,We believe a lot of these buildings serve as low income communities themselves and stabilizing them at the building level is really important to the community as a whole.,79,,
473,0.97,5060.121,5071.399,We expect the strategy to serve organizations in the office of housing portfolio as well as Aligning with the Seattle housing authority this time around.,79,,
474,0.97,5071.399,5086.681,You can see some of the organizations that receive funding and overall we serve 23 different organizations and we typically saw agency participation that was reflective of the size of each organization's portfolio.,79,,
475,0.97,5086.681,5098.293,Part of the strategy will also be directed toward a new technology solution for the streamlined grant and data management system.,79,,
476,0.97,5098.293,5104.399,And the 1.0 FTE term limited senior grandson contract specialist for the office of housing to administer these funds.,79,,
477,0.97,5104.399,5111.506,"Onto allocation three, this directs $6.2 million to Community-Based organizations.",79,,
478,0.97,5111.506,5139.801,"A strategy focused on black, indigenous and people of color communities, awarded through a competitive process for organizations with experience in homeless prevention funds, the office of housing is planning to issue a notice of funding and availability, the goal is for this to be as low barrier as possible and to identify agencies that are interested in providing assistance quickly in the community.",79,,
479,0.97,5139.801,5169.163,"We seek to achieve equitable outcomes through equitable processes and learning from the National best practices which director Alvarado mentioned earlier that have been published already to make this strategy successful which is reducing documentation, simplifying documentation and striving to get funds into the hands of communities of color who know how to best meet the needs of their community.",79,,
480,0.97,5169.163,5173.868,For allocation number four I will hand it over to our colleagues at City light and Spu.,79,,
481,0.97,5173.868,5179.774,"Great, thank you for the opportunity . Seattle public utilities.",80,,
482,0.97,5179.774,5183.177,It might be helpful to take a moment.,80,,
483,0.97,5183.177,5186.047,I know this committee does not typically deal with utility issues.,80,,
484,0.97,5186.047,5204.699,We have several members on the committee who are knowledgeable so I will take a moment to explain from the utility perspective how and why we see using a portion of the Federal rental assistance for utility delinquency to be crucial for keeping Renters in their homes.,80,,
485,0.97,5204.699,5233.394,"First of all, since March of last year the utilities have not imposed any penalties for nonpayment so there have been no Shutoffs, no late fees, no penalties for breaking payment plans, no penalties for nonpayment and while this has provided relief to low income families unable to pay their bills it is also resulting in thousands of customers committing very large balances.",80,,
486,0.97,5233.394,5251.246,We know that unpaid utility bills can be grounds for Eviction when Eviction moratorium lives so even if utilities are not imposing penalties landlords can Evict Renters for unpaid utility bills.,80,,
487,0.97,5251.246,5253.281,The utilities have key programs for providing low income assistance.,80,,
488,0.97,5253.281,5257.752,The utility discount program which is probably the one you are most familiar with.,80,,
489,0.97,5257.752,5273.368,"Ãšit has 42,000 households enrolled, it offers 50 to 60% off the customer utility bills but it only applies to charges received after enrolling in the program.",80,,
490,0.97,5273.368,5276.237,Really they do not do anything to help people with balances that they owe today.,80,,
491,0.97,5276.237,5283.544,The other key program that we have is the emergency assistance programs.,80,,
492,0.97,5283.544,5294.889,"So utilities each operate their own emergency assistance program but they are similar to one another, these programs have two important differences from the Udp that are important to highlight.",80,,
493,0.97,5294.889,5319.514,The first is the Udp is a prospective or Forward-Looking rate assistance program the emergency programs are retrospective providing one- time assistance toward the customer's outstanding balance that they owe today to whatever charges have accumulated in the past so it is the best program to respond to this Covid delinquency crisis.,80,,
494,0.97,5319.514,5347.942,"The other important thing to highlight is the emergency program has a higher income threshold than Udp so the emergency programs have a 10% higher threshold and they can help households who do not benefit from the utility discount programs, they are paying full price for their bills, they are still low income just over the Udp threshold so they have accumulated larger delinquent balances.",80,,
495,0.97,5347.942,5364.425,So what is being proposed as part of the legislation is to funnel a portion of the Federal rental assistance dollars through the utility emergency programs as a supplement to the assistance that we already provide through these programs.,80,,
496,0.97,5364.425,5372.133,Again because of the core issue that unpaid utility bills can be grounds for Eviction.,80,,
497,0.97,5372.133,5381.676,So the maximum assistance we can provide to a household through our emergency program is $922 per year and citywide is $400.,80,,
498,0.97,5381.676,5412.507,"Only households with children qualify for this amount, we are working with the executive to develop legislation so we can extend the maximum dollar amount to all income qualified households in response to Covid But even if we are able to do that there will be hundreds perhaps thousands of low-income households owing the utilities several hundred thousand dollars beyond what the emergency assistance can cover even at the maximum amount.",80,,
499,0.97,5412.507,5425.119,"The utilities cannot legally write off customer debt or balances, there are state statutory prohibitions against writing off debt and would break the bond covenants.",80,,
500,0.97,5425.119,5446.841,'s we are limited to what we can provide in these emergency assistance programs and again even if we are able to extend the maximum amount of emergency assistance to all income qualified households this year there will be thousands of Low- income customers with unpaid utility bills at risk of Eviction because of those unpaid utility bills.,80,,
501,0.97,5446.841,5453.347,With that I will ask my colleague Robert if he has anything to add.,80,,
502,0.97,5453.347,5455.416,Thank you.,81,,
503,0.97,5455.416,5458.252,I think you covered it really well.,81,,
504,0.97,5458.252,5473.067,"I will add for consideration one thing we need to be humble about what we don't know in our customers, they are making their own choices in the face of some challenging circumstances.",81,,
505,0.97,5473.067,5484.679,"So we know thousands or tens of thousands of customers are in crisis, you know we know many of them are not asking for support and we need to find a way to provide them services they are entitled to.",81,,
506,0.97,5484.679,5487.048,Nothing else to add.,81,,
507,0.97,5487.048,5489.817,Thank you.,81,,
508,0.97,5492.72,5499.694,So that is our presentation.,82,,
509,0.97,5499.694,5512.707,"Our next steps after receiving direction from city Council, hearing your questions and responding to any questions you have is to secure our technology solution.",82,,
510,0.97,5512.707,5542.737,We are working closely with Ãšking County and the State Department of Commerce who is also seeking to acquire technology to ensure tenant access and landlord access is easy for applying for rental assistance which will also help us to not only deliver the resources more quickly but then have strong data at the back end for accountability and for consistent evaluation of our approach.,82,,
511,0.97,5542.737,5565.693,We are establishing processes for quick contracting as you heard Kelly mention one of the key recommendations is that we reduce barriers to the application process because we want to make sure we move quickly including with Community-Based organizations who would have the secondary step of staffing up their own agencies to deliver these sources.,82,,
512,0.97,5565.693,5570.164,I will stop there.,82,,
513,0.97,5570.164,5580.141,"Chair Mosqueada, I will turn it over to you for discussion and questions and I will stop sharing my screen at this time unless you would like me to keep it up.",82,,
514,0.97,5580.141,5584.779,Keep it up for a second to see real questions specific to any slides.,83,,
515,0.97,5584.779,5593.354,Colleagues are there any questions you have specific to any slide or comments that you heard? I'm not seeing any.,83,,
516,0.97,5593.354,5600.061,Trying to come vice chair do you have a question or comment?,83,,
517,0.97,5600.061,5603.698,Not specific to a particular slide.,84,,
518,0.97,5603.698,5613.207,"I do have questions, but not necessarily do we need the slides up to Orient the questions.",84,,
519,0.97,5613.207,5615.81,Thank you.,84,,
520,0.97,5615.81,5643.938,My questions relate specifically to the concept of rental assistance funds that is targeted in such a way that not only identifies at risk tenants but also property owners who might be at risk of losing their property because of unpaid mortgage associated with unpaid rent.,84,,
521,0.97,5643.938,5681.475,"And so, just wondering whether or not some portion of the funding for rental assistance can be used to also address foreclosure prevention in rental housing to preserve naturally occurring affordable housing, you know during the Jumpstart deliberations last year, we passed an amendment asking that the executive make recommendation for a program like that and I think we are supposed to be getting an implementation plan in June this year.",84,,
522,0.97,5681.475,5685.146,So I just wanted to again highlight this question.,84,,
523,0.97,5685.146,5726.42,There are some early thoughts about it because I think we have a goal of targeting resources to help the most vulnerable tenants but when they live in housing that is also vulnerable to foreclosure because the landlord has an unpaid mortgage as opposed to landlords whose mortgages are paid but might have tenants who are also behind in their rent we are wondering what the thoughts are about that item and after that I have one of the following question.,84,,
524,0.97,5726.42,5730.024,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,85,,
525,0.97,5730.024,5733.494,I think your question brings up two issues for me.,85,,
526,0.97,5733.494,5745.506,One is what is the best program design to reach those targeted buildings and then two is what is the best outreach and advertising strategy to reach those buildings as well.,85,,
527,0.97,5745.506,5751.245,I think there is a balance that can help accomplish that outcome.,85,,
528,0.97,5751.245,5813.707,"First on the program design looking at the King County programs and assess what they were able to do through Covid- 19, their data demonstrates that for the purposes of small landlords which is a slightly different population than the at risk property but small landlords were best represented in the tenant pool . So the approach to the individualized tenant pool has been one of the best ways to reach tenants who live in properties with small landlords and part of that the new Treasury resource is for the first time, I guess not for the first time but through the Treasury there is explicit allowance for landlords to be have apply for their tenants so that could happen in the tenant pool as well and part of the technology we are seeking to purchase would have an entry point for a landlord and for a tenant to make the access to application more easy.",85,,
529,0.97,5813.707,5848.642,"So I think that program is Well- designed and has shown strong results to date that targeting that population but also on the question about at risk buildings, I think there is a way we can use some of our resource toward advertising and marketing to also seek out, through partnerships with Rha or other landlord associations, we can find and make sure we are delivering more information to those folks so that they are aware of the resources that are out there.",85,,
530,0.97,5848.642,5870.164,I will say at this point we are between the $145 million that is going through the county and the next round of anticipated resource our vision has been to keep the resources flowing and then use the advertising and marketing strategies to direct folks there.,85,,
531,0.97,5870.164,5874.268,That is helpful.,86,,
532,0.97,5874.268,5922.416,I did ask at a recent RPC meeting where the budget director presented on the program about their small landlord program and they were affected and that small landlord program enriching the tenant population so that was the tenants below 50% AMI who were adversely impacted due to covert and at high risk of Eviction but they did not target the small landlord assistance to landlords who had mortgage debt or particularly unpaid mortgage debt that was accumulating a risk for the property owner.,86,,
533,0.97,5922.416,5946.34,"I am interested in exploring this further I have reached out to advocates at the housing alliance to see whether or not they are aware of any pilot programs that might be working on the school and look forward to considering that sort of additive approach as well with you, director Alvarado.",86,,
534,0.97,5946.34,5984.378,"As a follow-up and thank you, you give me a great Segue when you Referenced the fact that the technology allows for the portal to be the entry portal, the application portal to be there from the tenant or from the landlord and I understand when a landlord applies they have to as we would want them to demonstrate eligibility . I have heard of some cases and you know I am taking people at their word when they write to me.",86,,
535,0.97,5984.378,6022.716,"I don't believe this is a widespread problem but I do have some small landlords contacting me, telling me that their tenants are not providing the income, they are not cooperating with the program requirements and some of those landlords really feel like they're in between a rock and a hard place, desiring to access the resources, believing that you know, they would be eligible and just wondering what we can do to help.",86,,
536,0.97,6022.716,6031.692,"I'm sure it is a relatively small population of landlords, but an unfortunate situation nonetheless.",86,,
537,0.97,6031.692,6036.13,Thank you for the question.,87,,
538,0.97,6036.13,6051.412,One of the benefits we have with this resource is that the Treasury guidance has made some efficiencies in terms of administration that are more helpful to overcoming some of the barriers you mentioned.,87,,
539,0.97,6051.412,6063.357,"For example, income certification can be satisfied by self certification rather than a more onerous process of reviewing many income documents.",87,,
540,0.97,6063.357,6079.64,Or for example Treasury does not require that there is regular posting and communication with tenants in a way that had been previously required by the county funds for example.,87,,
541,0.97,6079.64,6096.924,"Lastly, there is a piece under the Treasury guidance which does allow for direct payment to tenants when there is not responsiveness by the typical process which I think provides another way we can ensure money starts flowing and getting out the door.",87,,
542,0.97,6096.924,6117.01,"So, taken together I think we have more flexibility in the way in which we administer the funds to help make sure it is not an overly burdensome policy that is stopping landlords who should receive the money from getting it.",87,,
543,0.97,6117.01,6121.081,Can I trouble you to send me a description of those three components that you mentioned?,88,,
544,0.97,6121.081,6123.417,"So I can use that for my constituent response, thank you.",88,,
545,0.97,6123.417,6124.451,Absolutely.,88,,
546,0.97,6124.451,6131.225,"I will use it for mine, thank you very much Councilmember Herbold.",89,,
547,0.97,6131.225,6135.095,Additional comments or questions?,89,,
548,0.97,6135.095,6136.697,Council President please go ahead.,89,,
549,0.97,6136.697,6138.932,Inc.,90,,
550,0.97,6138.932,6142.169,You so much I would also like to borrow from your constituents correspondence.,90,,
551,0.97,6142.169,6146.24,Thank you for letting us freely play drives accurate information.,90,,
552,0.97,6146.24,6177.738,"Really quickly around the same concept but not necessarily in the residential side and maybe this is not the appropriate question for this Venue but I'm wondering for those individuals who are also looking for relief on the commercial side of issues related to this funding, is that something that is included as part of this Pass-Through or not?",90,,
553,0.97,6177.738,6183.176,This is specific to residential tenants so it does not allow for that use.,91,,
554,0.97,6183.176,6187.681,Okay great.,92,,
555,0.97,6187.681,6209.102,The only thing I will extrapolate is for the publicly subsidized portion we know that a lot of those providers are carrying commercial spaces in which there has not been regular rent paid and having full and complete payment of the residential rent helps their overall balance of the property but it cannot specifically be used for commercial support.,93,,
556,0.97,6209.102,6210.804,Got it.,94,,
557,0.97,6210.804,6226.42,"In those sort of projects that have Mixed-Use, there will be some sort of potential benefit but it is primarily rooted in residential assistance?",94,,
558,0.97,6226.42,6227.821,Exactly.,95,,
559,0.97,6227.821,6232.593,"Great, thank you so much.",96,,
560,0.97,6232.593,6234.928,Thank you Council President.,97,,
561,0.97,6234.928,6236.63,Any additional questions?,97,,
562,0.97,6236.63,6238.432,I have a few questions.,97,,
563,0.97,6238.432,6260.02,"When we look at the presentation, I think it was slide six and he talked about the various organizations distributing the money, can you take talk more about which organizations you are looking at and I want to underscore the importance of making sure folks have the opportunity to allocate those dollars.",97,,
564,0.97,6260.02,6279.072,"It's the right thing to do especially as we have been talking about those who know best about how to meet the needs within the community come from within the communities that have been hardest hit by displacement, by housing on Affordability and now by Covid.",97,,
565,0.97,6279.072,6285.579,So any flavor or additional context on who might be administering those dollars?,97,,
566,0.97,6285.579,6287.848,"Yes, thank you.",98,,
567,0.97,6287.848,6305.899,I will say obviously we will have a process by which we select folks but to give a general sense we are seeking organizations with experience administering rental assistance so that NARROWS the pool because we have to move quickly to get the funds spent in 2021.,98,,
568,0.97,6305.899,6318.311,And we're looking for Bipoc agencies who have history and expertise serving communities of color have been duly hit by Covid and housing instability.,98,,
569,0.97,6318.311,6343.036,"For example that might mean Leveraging some of the existing relationships with homelessness prevention providers who include--or Seattle Indian health board, United Indians of all tribes or it might be more broad agencies who deliver rental assistance but have not participated in city programs.",98,,
570,0.97,6343.036,6354.815,"For example, bird bar place who uses a state rent assistance program or Muslim housing services who have been instrumental in the county program.",98,,
571,0.97,6354.815,6358.051,Those are examples of the agencies.,98,,
572,0.97,6358.051,6362.756,Thank you very much.,99,,
573,0.97,6362.756,6380.14,"On that real quick, the organizations you mentioned, they actually have incredible tenure working within the community and often times have a century or decades worth of support.",99,,
574,0.97,6380.14,6389.683,So I appreciate that you have noted some of those in the process to make sure the dollars are allocated.,99,,
575,0.97,6389.683,6396.49,Traci I am happy to hear more from you if you have any concerns or questions or things you're interested in looking into.,99,,
576,0.97,6396.49,6411.705,"There was a sense of urgency, if you can give us a sense of how yesterday's announcement regarding the extension of the moratorium on Evictions, how that plays into this and what the Timeline looks like for us.",99,,
577,0.97,6411.705,6417.811,"I have reviewed the legislation, I do not have concerns or unanswered questions.",100,,
578,0.97,6417.811,6431.224,We have been able to talk to the executive agencies pretty quickly to get questions and concerns answered and it is a question about how comfortable you all are with what's proposed by the executive in terms of the allocation of funding.,100,,
579,0.97,6431.224,6442.469,Again to highlight the fact that this is the first of the resources the city will get we expect we will get some of the additional funds from the legislation from last year that passed.,100,,
580,0.97,6442.469,6477.571,"We may get funds although I don't think directly to the city from the state relief act that allocated upwards of $300 million of rental assistance, it seems to be targeted to local housing providers, that's the language used but I'm trying to clarity from Oir to confirm the city will not see those resources but another significant amount of money and then the county will be getting $145 million in confirmation of that to fund existing programs which we talked about today.",100,,
581,0.97,6477.571,6478.805,I don't have anything further to add.,100,,
582,0.97,6478.805,6485.111,I feel like my questions have mostly been answered but I look for direction from you all in terms of how you would like to proceed with the legislation.,100,,
583,0.97,6485.111,6517.777,"There have been some questions that Councilmember Herbold has asked and I still have a few questions around the dollars we are including for Seattle city light, I appreciate the overview and I understand Seattle city light was poised to impose collections and additional fee on votes prior to the Council coordination and plea to not do that prior to Covid in October of 2019.",101,,
584,0.97,6517.777,6521.381,Very happy that did not move forward especially in anticipation of what was to come.,101,,
585,0.97,6521.381,6526.686,And pleased that the policy continues to remain in place.,101,,
586,0.97,6526.686,6532.125,I think has made the difference between people putting food on the table or having to worry about keeping the lights on.,101,,
587,0.97,6532.125,6573.233,"I appreciate it but I'm also not sure that I understand why the 1.5, I'm not sure I fully understand why the 1.5 for Seattle city light and public utility needs to come from this allocation that's covered in slide 11 funding for utility assistance for eligible Renters and builds on administrative infrastructure of the emergency assistance program especially when we just heard from the previous presentation that the eligible uses of the American recovery act plan now say we can make necessary investments in water, sewer and other infrastructure.",101,,
588,0.97,6573.233,6589.683,And I want to make sure every dollar that is available specific for rental assistance is getting directly into the hands of the Renters and via Renters into the hands of small landlords to address issues that were brought up.,101,,
589,0.97,6589.683,6591.751,What is the average amount of rental assistance?,101,,
590,0.97,6591.751,6594.955,Can you remind me?,101,,
591,0.97,6594.955,6596.823,For each recipient what they usually get currently?,101,,
592,0.97,6596.823,6601.161,It is roughly between 3000 and $5000.,102,,
593,0.97,6601.161,6610.971,Both the typical need and what has been typically provided through the various assistance programs.,102,,
594,0.97,6610.971,6632.726,Conservatively if every Renter were to receive the $5000 allotment if we were able to find a different revenue source for this $1.5 million that would mean at least 300 families in the city would be able to have rental assistance stable at the maximum amount.,103,,
595,0.97,6632.726,6670.93,"I'm not in a position to say this need is greater than this need, we have spent tremendous time over the last year preventing against austerity is budgeting . I want to say it is important now that we have greater understanding and with the clarification that there is the ability to use direct aid for necessary investments in infrastructure including water and infrastructure services that we look at whether or not that is better use of those sources and whether all the allocation available from the December congressional act could be used toward rental assistance.",103,,
596,0.97,6670.93,6679.873,Traci I will leave us at briefing and discussion today and we look forward to working with all of you to help answer those questions.,103,,
597,0.97,6679.873,6681.875,"If you have comments in response to that, feel free.",103,,
598,0.97,6681.875,6683.943,I do not want to cut you off.,103,,
599,0.97,6683.943,6692.485,"But again, I think there are some questions I would look into there.",103,,
600,0.97,6692.485,6693.086,Only seen Traci.,103,,
601,0.97,6693.086,6695.288,If you have anything else you would like to say.,103,,
602,0.97,6695.288,6709.369,The only thing I will add is would you desire to bring this back on April 6 for more possible discussion and vote and if so I would love to hear from your colleagues about any proposed amendments or questions that you need answered prior to that date.,104,,
603,0.97,6709.369,6711.371,"Excellent, yes.",105,,
604,0.97,6711.371,6742.035,"Our next meeting is April 6. as noted it will be intensely focused over the next few meetings as we talk about Covid relief provided, we have some items we need to continue to keep in the Finance Committee and I would like to make sure it is a quick conversation because we want to provide additional insurance to community members that money is coming but given the extension of the moratorium yesterday I think we have a little bit of flexibility here.",105,,
605,0.97,6742.035,6747.24,To take a little bit of time to see if there is any need for amendments.,105,,
606,0.97,6747.24,6748.141,Okay.,105,,
607,0.97,6748.141,6763.356,I think that is right and Traci I may have missed it but by when would you like to receive potential amendments from us?,106,,
608,0.97,6763.356,6770.864,Probably the week before we walk into committee so that would be the week of the 29th of March.,107,,
609,0.97,6770.864,6779.372,So can we get the distributed to your colleagues as well for their review prior to committee action on the six.,107,,
610,0.97,6779.372,6785.078,Let's say a hard deadline of noon next Friday to put a fine point on it.,108,,
611,0.97,6785.078,6786.079,Great.,108,,
612,0.97,6786.079,6793.386,Thank you Council president for asking the question.,108,,
613,0.97,6793.386,6799.492,"I was going to say I would like to have those hard deadlines, it helps central staff and us as well.",109,,
614,0.97,6799.492,6810.703,I am hearing by noon March 26 we should have identified amendments to Traci.,109,,
615,0.97,6810.703,6813.706,That's correct.,110,,
616,0.97,6813.706,6814.307,Thank you very much.,110,,
617,0.97,6814.307,6820.613,That will give time for all of you on the line to make sure we have time to run those amendments by you.,110,,
618,0.97,6820.613,6824.617,Vice chair did you have any additional comments?,110,,
619,0.97,6824.617,6831.191,"I do, but I will raise it with you chair Mosqueada Off- line.",111,,
620,0.97,6831.191,6834.994,It is related to the timing of amendments.,111,,
621,0.97,6834.994,6837.096,Appreciate it.,111,,
622,0.97,6837.096,6845.638,If the Timeline works we will keep it and happy to chat more off-line.,111,,
623,0.97,6845.638,6866.259,"Okay I want to thank you for tremendous relief to community members, whether it is through the utility discount program, preventing Eviction notices from going out or watershed shut off or light shut off, your providing a tremendous service to make sure people have less stress in their life so thank you very much.",111,,
624,0.97,6866.259,6877.136,We appreciate all of your work and we will work with you considering possible amendments but mostly interested in making sure those questions get answered before moving on.,111,,
625,0.97,6877.136,6881.14,Okay thank you for your time today.,111,,
626,0.97,6881.14,6885.478,Appreciate it.,111,,
627,0.97,6885.478,6894.954,"Thank you for your work and for your review, I hope we get a chance to hear more from you as you get a chance to dig into any questions.",111,,
628,0.97,6894.954,6898.191,Colleagues I have one more item for you before we get into wrapping up today's agenda.,111,,
629,0.97,6898.191,6902.895,If you don't mind we have a few more minutes left in today's meeting.,111,,
630,0.97,6902.895,6911.204,I wanted to draw your attention to the possibility for signing on to a letter that is circulated to the members of the Finance and housing committee here today.,111,,
631,0.97,6911.204,6939.132,As is our requirements and per code we are required to collect signatures on any items with more than a Quorum but if we bring it forward to public forum all public members are allowed to sign onto statements one of the things I would like to consider asking for signature today is a letter we have drafted with the help of the office of Intergovernmental relations.,111,,
632,0.97,6939.132,6944.337,Thank you as well Council President as you have provided feedback on the letter.,111,,
633,0.97,6944.337,6955.715,"We would like to send a letter to express support for a bill that the representative and majority leader is working on, House bill 1220.",111,,
634,0.97,6955.715,6965.658,The importance of this letter is to make sure members of the Senate housing and local government committee can receive comments supporting the legislation in front of them prior to Thursday.,111,,
635,0.97,6965.658,6976.235,What better timing than to have a meeting specifically focused on housing for colleagues of the Seattle city Council to consider signing on to.,111,,
636,0.97,6976.235,6981.941,House bill 1220 provides an update to the growth management act to include planning for and accommodating for affordable housing.,111,,
637,0.97,6981.941,7010.97,"Requires jurisdictions to address racially disparate impacts and displacement prohibiting cities from not allowing emergency housing, permanent supportive housing or indoor emergency shelters for multifamily commercial or Mixed- use zones where short-term rentals are allowed . This bill is very important to make sure we show support for all the cities working on planning for affordable housing needs so all community members have a safe, stable and accessible place to call home.",111,,
638,0.97,7010.97,7021.681,Especially given the conversation we just had about how Covid has exacerbated unstable housing situations and we have seen many more people fall into homelessness.,111,,
639,0.97,7021.681,7030.223,This is the effort as a state to show partnership with the state to ensure jurisdictions are offering safe places for neighbors experiencing homelessness.,111,,
640,0.97,7030.223,7051.811,I would love to have this letter sent to our members and colleagues in the Legislature to express support from Seattle city council for House bill 1220 so that the Senate housing and local government committee can have that in hand as we consider the bill in the Thursday meeting.,111,,
641,0.97,7051.811,7063.556,So is there any questions about the bill? about the bill summary for the draft letter that I sent for consideration of possible Sign-On today?,111,,
642,0.97,7063.556,7066.359,Hoping to use this form to get as many signatures as possible.,111,,
