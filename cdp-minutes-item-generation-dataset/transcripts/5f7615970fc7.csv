93,0.97,548.781,551.751,It would basically just expand coverage around the state.,23,,

101,0.97,596.596,598.664,I believe our contract lobbyists are tracking that one.,25,,

110,0.97,647.613,672.772,"That was taken out of the rainy day Fund, which I think everyone is sort of an agreement that there won't be the momentum to get the votes, to use the money from the rainy day Fund, but the Washington housing alliance also has a budget proposal around trying to make sure there is a little bit of expansion to those two programs, and I think there's a possibility there may be action on that.",25,,
111,0.97,672.772,677.276,"I wanted to let you know, we are watching that as a budget item.",25,,
112,0.97,677.276,680.046,"There are several bills, so many housing bills it's sort of unbelievable.",25,,
113,0.97,680.046,692.958,"It certainly points to what a priority this is for legislators because even in the short session, you see this spends almost 3 pages in your update.",25,,
114,0.97,692.958,694.627,I will go through the bill white bill.,25,,
115,0.97,694.627,719.919,"We will certainly offer to follow up with you if you have questions on particular bells, but there are three bills that I think we have most of the authority to do in Seattle, which are just cause Eviction, and then the house and justice act bill that would prohibit landlords from using criminal records that Senator Daniel is supporting in the Senate, Senate bill 6490.",25,,
116,0.97,719.919,725.224,"There's also an installment payment bill, the first bill on your list, hospital 1694.",25,,

119,0.97,730.896,733.966,Thank you.,27,,
120,0.97,742.174,744.31,I am not sure if I missed you talking about 2907.,27,,
121,0.97,744.31,746.178,If I might ask you some questions about that.,27,,
122,0.97,746.178,747.246,Sure.,28,,
123,0.97,747.246,755.855,Can you go over the outlines of this bill very quickly?,29,,
124,0.97,755.855,767.666,"I know it authorizes counties with populations over 2,000,002 past taxes, but specifically, what I would like to hear from you right now is, what was the conversation like when this was put forward?",29,,
125,0.97,767.666,779.478,"I wasn't here last Monday because I was out of town, but if you did do a briefing or did Oir do a brief?",29,,
126,0.97,779.478,780.88,Was this mentioned at that time or not?,29,,
127,0.97,780.88,783.682,"As far as my office is concerned, we only heard it in the press.",29,,
128,0.97,783.682,798.364,"I am really concerned if this is not brought to the Council in the briefings, the first chance that you got, so if you could explain that.",29,,
129,0.97,798.364,804.47,"Also, in terms of the outlines of this, and what's been announced by the county, this bill does not make the taxes happen.",29,,
130,0.97,804.47,808.707,It just gives the authority to the county to do the tax.,29,,
131,0.97,808.707,830.029,"If the county were to pass the tax, from what I've understood, if this state though passes the county would effectively erase $40 million for Seattle, which I think is pitiful given the scale of the crisis.",29,,
132,0.97,830.029,841.006,"I would like you to talk about the discussion from elected officials at the county and state level, and also with the Mayor things.",29,,
133,0.97,841.006,849.348,"Just to make it very clear, this is even less than the bill that was passed, and repealed by the majority of the Council in 2018.",29,,
134,0.97,849.348,850.95,Councilmember Mosqueda and I voted against the bill.,29,,
135,0.97,850.95,854.353,"To me, that's extremely concerning when even the McKinsey report, which is not a Socialist report.",29,,
136,0.97,854.353,859.291,"It's a report from the Chamber, and big businesses.",29,,
137,0.97,859.291,868.234,"Even they are very frankly saying, the crisis is so bad, that it would require raising anywhere from $400 Million- $1 billion every year.",29,,
138,0.97,868.234,870.236,That's how bad the crisis is.,29,,
139,0.97,870.236,875.474,It seems like this is Tom deaf to the crisis.,29,,
140,0.97,875.474,880.779,"And then the other question is, what's the conversation on any State ban?",29,,
141,0.97,880.779,886.085,I imagine big businesses are only including that.,29,,
142,0.97,886.085,890.756,I am going to go ahead and start.,30,,
143,0.97,890.756,901.3,"As you know, this is part of a broad conversation, and in the beginning, the legislation had not been introduced since our last briefing.",30,,
144,0.97,901.3,907.806,"It has something been introduced, which is why we are briefing you on it today.",30,,
145,0.97,907.806,910.209,We will keep you updated as things develop.,30,,
146,0.97,910.209,914.747,"At this stage, there is no Preemption in the legislation.",30,,
147,0.97,914.747,937.436,"That's something, given the councils Prioritization of Progressive revenue, a conversation we definitely want to be at the stable table for Carm stay engaged in, the amount that the proposal would raise is $120 million as the estimate currently.",30,,
148,0.97,937.436,942.741,"I will have Robin fill in the Perimeters, but we hear your concerns and understand that very clearly.",30,,
149,0.97,942.741,948.447,We will continue to keep everyone updated as this proposal moves forward through the legislative process.,30,,
150,0.97,948.447,973.672,"I would just add that it's a payroll tax on earners that about $150,000 per year, and the focus of what the revenue would be used for is housing, homelessness, behavioral health, and public safety, but the public safety portion isn't meant for law enforcement.",31,,
151,0.97,973.672,981.547,"It's from the services, so people engaged with the public safety system could have access to services.",31,,
152,0.97,981.547,985.384,I think Councilmember Sawant's points are well taken.,32,,
153,0.97,985.384,997.262,"I am also sorry I was not able to have a conversation prior to this bill being introduced, as well, but I do have a lot of trust in representative Mccreary.",32,,
154,0.97,997.262,1007.506,"I know she's heard concerns lot unclear foam Pucks calling for additional housing, and I know she is well aware that $100 million or $120 million is not sufficient.",32,,
155,0.97,1007.506,1012.01,$40 million coming to the city of Seattle would be a drop in the bucket.,32,,
156,0.97,1012.01,1032.765,"We were looking at $48 million with the scaled down version of the hours tax, so I appreciate the skill Councilmember Sawant has Oakland, and I I started to understand we need to look at partnership with are County cities with Governance and King County.",32,,
157,0.97,1032.765,1043.575,"In doing so, we would want to make sure we can layer any additional services we would need, and that we also are not only looking at shelter services.",32,,
158,0.97,1043.575,1047.046,I think everyone has talked about requiring an investment in housing long-term.,32,,
159,0.97,1047.046,1058.19,I think I appreciate other item Agendas looking at tenant protection and Scaling up housing.,32,,
160,0.97,1058.19,1063.829,I want to underscore the point around Preemption.,32,,
161,0.97,1063.829,1068.867,Having any bills that takes away tools on the cusp of a recession would be problematic.,32,,
162,0.97,1068.867,1080.879,"As the now chair of finance and budget, I believe we have a serious conversation we need to uphold about how we can allow for cities to have tools in their Toolkit.",32,,
163,0.97,1080.879,1088.62,"We may need dollars at some point to raise for apprenticeship programs or Childcare programs, or small business support.",32,,
164,0.97,1088.62,1098.764,"When we have tools in our Toolkit, that doesn't mean they are up for grabs when there's another proposal on the table.",32,,
165,0.97,1098.764,1103.001,"We do appreciate County folks wanting to potentially step in, but there is a lot of unknown manner.",32,,
166,0.97,1103.001,1129.027,"As you continue your conversation in Olympia, thank you for recognizing that the city, in my perspective, I will speak for myself, that city Councilmembers as the legislative branch, this is a legislative tool we have that we would need to continue to be updated about in the conversation because a conversation about for moving this tool seems very dangerous, especially when we are responsible for a very complex budget with a potential recession on the horizon.",32,,
167,0.97,1129.027,1135.534,The concept of giving away a tool at the city level is something we have fought year after year.,32,,
168,0.97,1135.534,1137.903,Our friends at the Awc fight Preemption all the time.,32,,
169,0.97,1137.903,1152.017,Having a conversation at a syllable tool requires a city council discussion.,32,,
170,0.97,1153.018,1154.453,I want to underscore your points.,32,,
171,0.97,1154.453,1157.356,I think they are well taken and an important part of the dialogue in Olympia.,32,,
172,0.97,1157.356,1158.056,Councilmember Sawant.,32,,
173,0.97,1158.056,1158.857,Thank you.,33,,
174,0.97,1158.857,1172.938,I really appreciate you sort of joining in that point about how we want County tax and city tools.,33,,
175,0.97,1172.938,1179.978,It should be a statement that that's how Seattle got into this.,33,,
176,0.97,1179.978,1203.402,"Seattle has the most Regressive tax mission because the state has translated our ability to raise progressive revenues, and so any talk towards a state ban or passing big business taxes, Preemption, the reason I'm saying state that, Preemption is not clear to a lot of people who are not engaged deeply into city and state politics.",33,,
177,0.97,1203.402,1205.304,I think that would go in the wrong direction.,33,,
178,0.97,1205.304,1214.713,I would be curious if you can report any public statements made by progressive Democrats about holding the line on the state that.,33,,
179,0.97,1214.713,1226.925,And I would also like to note that the reason this is happening has to do with how much momentum there is among the public to actually address this problem.,33,,
180,0.97,1226.925,1238.637,I agree that the balance of solutions has to be toward providing housing and strengthening tenant rights because prevention is the best solution really to end homelessness.,33,,
181,0.97,1238.637,1244.142,Thank you.,34,,
182,0.97,1244.142,1260.225,"Just to respond, in terms of the press from elected officials, we are happy to aggregate any of the news that we have access to, and send out your way.",34,,
183,0.97,1260.225,1266.498,"I think there have been a lot of generalities at this point, in terms of legislators saying, we are beginning this conversation.",34,,
184,0.97,1266.498,1278.744,"But just to underscore why I'm focusing on this, is that instinctively, you would be Nace and politics do not know that this is the real price and big business wants out of this.",34,,
185,0.97,1278.744,1288.887,"They have fought tooth and nail any taxes on them, and the only reason they would agree to something like this is if they can get the real price, which is a ban on cities doing it.",34,,
186,0.97,1288.887,1293.558,"Basically, Seattle doing this.",34,,
187,0.97,1293.558,1303.301,"The reason I'm focusing on this is because publicly, the downtown Seattle Association has already issued a letter in which they are making it really clear what they want from this, is exactly this.",34,,
188,0.97,1303.301,1305.504,Cities like Seattle not being able to pass their own taxes.,34,,
189,0.97,1305.504,1311.61,Thank you.,35,,
190,0.97,1311.61,1316.315,Councilmembers any other questions?,36,,
191,0.97,1316.315,1316.815,Councilmember Pedersen.,36,,
192,0.97,1316.815,1327.893,Interested in hearing more about the exemptions for small businesses you mentioned.,37,,
193,0.97,1327.893,1345.977,"I believe there will be some small business support at the hearing on Tuesday something businesses under 50 employees, and I believe is embraced by the small business community but I should retract that until I get confirmation.",38,,
194,0.97,1345.977,1351.249,Others on my team have more information.,38,,
195,0.97,1351.249,1353.385,Councilmember Lewis.,39,,
196,0.97,1359.291,1364.029,This is more of a procedural question about potential advocacy for the bill or what the city's official position is at this point.,40,,
197,0.97,1364.029,1372.17,"Speaking purely for myself at this point, the bill in its current form is something I very enthusiastically support.",40,,
198,0.97,1372.17,1373.772,It's a progressive tax assessed on a Countywide basis.,40,,
199,0.97,1373.772,1378.043,It currently doesn't have a Preemption.,40,,
200,0.97,1378.043,1381.48,It's definitely something we can build on.,40,,
201,0.97,1381.48,1384.616,It's something I would like to see enacted and implemented.,40,,
202,0.97,1388.186,1391.99,My position and opinion on this bill could certainly evolve throughout the give and take of the legislative session.,40,,
203,0.97,1391.99,1422.12,"I guess my question is, whether we are currently in a position where the city's posture is advocate to maintain the bill in its current form, and how the office will work to represent the Council and the executive to convey potential differing opinions.",40,,
204,0.97,1422.12,1426.792,"Based on how it does evolve in Olympia, just flagging that now.",40,,
205,0.97,1426.792,1432.831,"Since this is a short session, we might not have that many additional briefings between now and significant movement on this bill.",40,,
206,0.97,1432.831,1444.843,"I haven't really canvassed my colleagues to see what all of us are generally thinking, but that's my first question, more procedural.",40,,
207,0.97,1444.843,1459.09,I think we are strongest in Olympia priorities about progressive revenue and other priorities for the Council when we have a unified position at the city level.,41,,
208,0.97,1459.09,1467.432,"That is something we will work very hard to make sure that everyone on Council, everyone's concerns are addressed.",41,,
209,0.97,1467.432,1472.671,This is something moving very quickly right now.,41,,
210,0.97,1472.671,1480.579,We will continue to keep you updated individually as we hear concerns back from you.,41,,
211,0.97,1480.579,1484.883,"At this stage, I have not heard from anyone that they do not support the proposal in the current form.",41,,
212,0.97,1484.883,1486.585,Our plan is to sign pro on Tuesday.,41,,
213,0.97,1486.585,1498.897,"If things change in the meantime, we are in constant communication with you all around those changes, and what the city's position will be.",41,,
214,0.97,1498.897,1501.566,We will make sure to keep everyone engaged as the process moves forward.,41,,
215,0.97,1501.566,1503.168,Let me extrapolate a little bit.,42,,
216,0.97,1503.168,1504.002,The point is well taken.,42,,
217,0.97,1504.002,1514.713,Ãšit does seem like you are Articulating or expressing to legislators that there is significant concern.,42,,
218,0.97,1514.713,1520.018,For a ban.,42,,
219,0.97,1520.018,1521.419,That relates to individual Councilmembers.,42,,
220,0.97,1521.419,1521.786,Is that fair?,42,,
221,0.97,1521.786,1529.227,I believe Councilmember Strauss also echoed those concerns in Olympia last week.,43,,

226,0.97,1562.661,1567.766,I want to make it really clear that I am a hard pass on exemption.,45,,
227,0.97,1567.766,1590.155,"I think it's really important that, as a city, we have every tool available to us to address the needs in the city, particularly for the folks were most honorable and at risk of getting pushed out of the city.",45,,
228,0.97,1590.155,1595.226,"That means we need to be able to raise the revenue in a progressive way to fund many, many needs we have in the city.",45,,

324,0.97,2152.783,2155.486,"And then on Thursday, the House version passed out of the house, 56-40.",73,,
325,0.97,2155.486,2158.856,"We are hearing that the House version, since it has passed, is going to be that vehicle.",73,,
326,0.97,2158.856,2168.432,"We so expect that Senate action will resume after that hearing in a couple of weeks, once House of origin cutoffs have passed.",73,,
327,0.97,2168.432,2175.072,And then one other piece of legislation to flag that was just introduced after last week's Council briefing.,73,,
328,0.97,2175.072,2185.416,Senator Lee's introduced car tabs.,73,,
329,0.97,2195.526,2209.006,"It would transition from the current 1996, evaluation scheduled to the 2006 schedule, and sound transit has stated, publicly, this would reduce their expected revenue by $1 billion, if they bonded to address the short-term implications of losing that revenue.",73,,
330,0.97,2209.006,2212.51,"The overall cost over there, the capital improvement program, would be about $2.93 billion.",73,,
331,0.97,2212.51,2228.326,"The legislation also addresses a portion of 976, specifically 976 repealed sound transit's 1.1% motor vehicle excise tax.",73,,
332,0.97,2228.326,2230.061,And dropped that to the .3% rate.,73,,
333,0.97,2230.061,2235.233,This would restore the .1%.,73,,
334,0.97,2235.233,2237.301,It would require a two thirds vote of the Legislature.,73,,
335,0.97,2237.301,2245.61,It's an amending initiative that passed within two years.,73,,
336,0.97,2245.61,2261.759,"It does seem that the Senate Republicans are not supportive, and so it's unclear, at this point, if it will have the momentum to gain a two thirds vote, but we are, nonetheless, monitoring it closely given the potential impacts to sound transit, and Light-Rail expansion within the city.",73,,
337,0.97,2261.759,2271.902,You?,74,,
338,0.97,2272.236,2276.307,"When the House bill comes down to the Senate, I would be happy to come down and testify again.",75,,
339,0.97,2276.307,2277.275,Thank you so much.,76,,
340,0.97,2277.275,2280.811,"I know sometimes, scheduling occurs at the last minute because the pace is fast in Olympia.",77,,
341,0.97,2280.811,2285.883,Feel free to keep my office updated.,77,,
342,0.97,2285.883,2286.45,Much appreciated.,78,,
343,0.97,2286.45,2287.652,I have one last question.,79,,
344,0.97,2287.652,2289.92,"This goes back to the low carbon fuel standard boat, 52- 44.",79,,
345,0.97,2289.92,2295.593,"I wonder, so that member implies to me that some Democrats in the legislation voted against it.",79,,
346,0.97,2295.593,2315.813,"I wonder if--well, first off, how many Democrats crossed the line, and if any Republicans voted for it, and if there was a geographic kind of break down of where the Democrats that didn't support it represent, and what lessons that might indicate for the chances in the Senate.",79,,
347,0.97,2315.813,2321.585,Sure.,80,,
348,0.97,2321.585,2329.694,"The current makeup of the House of Representatives is 57-40, which means five Democrats switched over, and voted no with the majority of Republicans, or I should say the unanimous backing for Republicans.",80,,
349,0.97,2329.694,2335.733,I don't know the geographic distribution.,80,,
350,0.97,2335.733,2345.142,"I believe they represent more rural areas, but I can find those who voted that way, and provide that report to you.",80,,
351,0.97,2345.142,2347.144,Thank you.,81,,
352,0.97,2347.144,2347.478,Excellent.,81,,
353,0.97,2347.478,2353.25,Any additional questions or comments for our legislative team?,81,,
354,0.97,2353.25,2356.721,Okay.,81,,
355,0.97,2356.721,2357.221,Closing comments?,81,,

365,0.97,2392.056,2393.691,"Okay, we are five minutes ahead of schedule.",82,,
366,0.97,2393.691,2397.561,Let's go ahead and continue on with a preview of today's Council with an update from all of you.,82,,
367,0.97,2397.561,2400.998,The preview of today's Council is that we have a few items on the agenda.,82,,

373,0.97,2450.548,2452.75,We may also have an update on the future of work.,82,,
374,0.97,2452.75,2456.253,"More information coming, about that.",82,,
375,0.97,2456.253,2469.467,"Lastly, I want to thank folks who really did help our office out.",83,,
376,0.97,2471.735,2475.539,"I mentioned our incredible team, who, over the last three and half months have really held down the Fort.",83,,
377,0.97,2475.539,2478.576,"I want to thank each of you, and your offices, for working with our team.",83,,
378,0.97,2478.576,2480.177,"The communications team, the clerk's team, central staff.",83,,

380,0.97,2483.647,2487.084,"It was an amazing time to be with my newborn, and I was in communication with her dad.",83,,
381,0.97,2487.084,2490.387,This is her first day out there just the two of them together.,83,,
382,0.97,2490.387,2493.991,"I wish him the best of luck on his Paternity leave, as well.",83,,
383,0.97,2493.991,2500.097,It was a great opportunity.,83,,
384,0.97,2500.097,2501.899,I want to thank you for making it possible.,83,,
385,0.97,2501.899,2511.909,"Lastly, I did have a chance with our daughter, Camilla, to go to two rallies last week.",83,,
386,0.97,2511.909,2528.525,"I want to continue to send our notes of solidarity to the workers at 11 my nine Healthcare West, who are continuing to engage in negotiation, and demand that the bargain be met with folks at Swedish, and Providence, and Unfortunately, as many of you know, were turned away when they went back last week.",83,,
387,0.97,2528.525,2536.834,"So, we are sending a message of solidarity today as they wrap up their negotiations, hopefully, and they hear the city, as we stood in solidarity with them downtown last week.",83,,
388,0.97,2536.834,2542.339,"Also, I have a chance to join U.S. 21, who work at the Macy's retail store downtown.",83,,
389,0.97,2542.339,2551.515,"Some of you may know, it's closing its doors downtown.",83,,
390,0.97,2551.515,2556.353,"Unfortunately, the folks who are downtown are getting offered a different severance package than those on the North end on the South end.",83,,
391,0.97,2556.353,2581.579,"Less severance benefits, and less overall compensation, and, you know, recognizing we represent one of the most expensive places to live in the state, and the hardest places to find housing, hoping that those negotiations continue, and ended up in a good place.",83,,
392,0.97,2581.579,2584.248,"Really hoping that our friends step up, and show what it means.",83,,
393,0.97,2584.248,2585.249,We know businesses close their doors.,83,,
394,0.97,2585.249,2589.353,"People open their doors off and on, hoping this is a good example for other retail businesses when transition happens.",83,,
395,0.97,2589.353,2593.958,"So, thank you to those unions, workers, and the small businesses who stood with those workers, as well.",83,,
396,0.97,2593.958,2595.993,I look forward to working with all of you.,83,,
397,0.97,2595.993,2596.427,That's my update.,83,,
398,0.97,2596.427,2596.894,Councilmember Sawant.,83,,
399,0.97,2596.894,2597.895,"Thank you, president Mosqueda.",84,,
400,0.97,2597.895,2598.262,Welcome back.,84,,
401,0.97,2598.262,2602.9,Thank you.,85,,
402,0.97,2602.9,2606.937,"I wanted to echo your point about the Healthcare workers at 1199, who are conducting a valiant struggle.",86,,
403,0.97,2606.937,2608.973,It's incredible how much community support there was for them.,86,,
404,0.97,2608.973,2615.512,"In some cases, they actually had 1000 people estimated at one Pickett.",86,,
405,0.97,2615.512,2616.313,It was really incredible.,86,,
406,0.97,2616.313,2636.934,"I want to thank all of my staff, and members of the Socialist alternative, who were there, at the picket lines, and thank you for sharing the Macy's worker concerns, as well.",86,,
407,0.97,2636.934,2640.17,There is one item on today's city council agenda from the Sustainability and Renter rights committee.,86,,
408,0.97,2640.17,2642.006,That's the ordinance you mentioned on banning winter Evictions.,86,,
409,0.97,2642.006,2649.413,"The winter Evictions legislation prevents Renters, tenants, from being turnout during the cold, winter months.",86,,
410,0.97,2649.413,2657.755,"The legislation does not prevent all Evictions, but it doesn't stop people who are behind on their rent from being forced onto the streets during the cold and what part of the year.",86,,
411,0.97,2657.755,2681.078,"We saw the study, sponsored by the way man's Commission, losing homes showed predominately Colic overwhelmingly, the people who are unable to pay their rent fall short by very small amounts, and they are overwhelmingly black women let household, and very low income people.",86,,
412,0.97,2681.078,2685.182,This is clearly in line with every aspect of social justice we might think of as far as housing is concerned.,86,,
413,0.97,2685.182,2689.787,"Last November, the Seattle Renters Commission asked a recommendation to the city Council to put forward this legislation.",86,,
414,0.97,2689.787,2712.376,"It would be the first of its kind in the U.S., although some kinds of protections in the winter months are in place in some other cities and States, but this proposal that was brought forward by the Renter's Commission is modeled after something that has been in existence for seven decades in France, so it will be quite an innovative thing that we would be doing.",86,,
415,0.97,2712.376,2729.226,"My office introduced the first version of that legislation last December, and then on January 23 at the Sustainability and Renter's rights Committee, we had a very engaged discussion on an amended version of the legislation that I put forward in December.",86,,
416,0.97,2729.226,2732.996,"The amended version incorporates a lot of the feedback we heard from tenant rights advocates, and small landlords.",86,,
417,0.97,2732.996,2747.311,"At that meeting, Councilmember Lewis indicated he would like to look into medication funding to possibly prepare an amendment.",86,,
418,0.97,2747.311,2749.98,Thank you for being in touch with Jonathan Rosenblum from my office about that.,86,,
419,0.97,2749.98,2753.617,"I understand, it's ready for today, but I will let you say more about that.",86,,
420,0.97,2753.617,2767.431,"There were also questions raised about how the just cause Evictions ordinance, and therefore this winter Evictions ban ordinance because it's sort of modeled after the just cause, would impact people on fixed term leases.",86,,
421,0.97,2767.431,2769.533,The question has now been answered for all Council offices.,86,,
422,0.97,2769.533,2771.869,"In short, there's a loophole at the end of fixed term leases.",86,,
423,0.97,2771.869,2774.138,There is a loophole in the just cause Eviction ordinance.,86,,
424,0.97,2774.138,2775.139,We are aware of it.,86,,
425,0.97,2775.139,2787.951,"My office has been in conversations with the city attorney's office for more than a couple of years now, wanting to close this loophole, but they've had some concerns, so we have deferred to that, but I think it is now time to address that.",86,,
426,0.97,2787.951,2809.873,"But that's something that we can do separately from a just cause, to sort of bring forward a full-fledged just cause Eviction notice that we do plan to do from my office, but that would be a separate ordinance.",86,,
427,0.97,2809.873,2815.779,"Other than that, all Renters are covered by just cause, and therefore all Renters would be covered by this bill, as well because it's modeled after just cause.",86,,
428,0.97,2815.779,2818.215,There's also a question about what medication funding exists for tenants and landlords.,86,,
429,0.97,2818.215,2833.897,"My personal view is that landlords should not have medication funding because, really, if you provide medication funding to the landlord, and the tenant, then the landlord gets paid and the tenant gets to maintain the housing, so just being motivated from the tenants, the landlords.",86,,
430,0.97,2833.897,2846.41,"However, that question has also been answered, as far as I understand from Washington community action network, Emailing the Council last week with information about the state medication funds already in existence for landlords, and about the mitigation funds for tenants, particularly through the Home-Based program.",86,,
431,0.97,2846.41,2858.021,"I would support increased funding for the Home-Based program, and also, looking for ways to help more tenants know this is an option.",86,,
432,0.97,2858.021,2860.858,I think this is a significant barrier to tenants who don't know.,86,,
433,0.97,2860.858,2863.46,"When they find out, it's too late and Eviction proceedings are already underway.",86,,
434,0.97,2863.46,2878.075,"That's one place for the Council can have a lot of impact with the Department, really doing much better outreach for the tenants, letting them know that this exists . As for my office, at this point, we have now seen, and addressed every question, an amendment that has been brought forward, to our knowledge.",86,,
435,0.97,2878.075,2914.444,"And because Councilmember Lewis was working on an amendment, we delayed the bill, so it is now on today's city council agenda, rather than last week is puff, but I understand some Councilmembers would still like more time, and I appreciate that, so I have agreed to support holding the bill for another week through February, but I would urge all Councilmembers who have any further concerns aside from the ones that have been addressed or have ideas for amendments, if you could please reach out to my office as soon as possible, so we can get this underway.",86,,
436,0.97,2914.444,2920.717,"Councilmember Sawant, the bill that you are going to potentially move to next week, can you repeat the bill?",87,,
437,0.97,2920.717,2921.818,Yes.,88,,
438,0.97,2921.818,2927.691,That's the second on today's agenda.,88,,
439,0.97,2927.691,2928.091,119726.,88,,
440,0.97,2928.091,2929.393,Just for the viewing audience.,89,,
441,0.97,2929.393,2933.23,Thank you for that transparency.,89,,
442,0.97,2933.23,2935.198,I know folks are still working on amendments.,89,,
443,0.97,2935.198,2938.335,"If you do want to comment on any amendments you are working on, that's wonderful.",89,,
444,0.97,2938.335,2944.808,"Otherwise, thank you for your office is puff openness to working with others on potential amendments.",89,,
445,0.97,2944.808,2946.276,I look forward to having that discussion.,89,,
446,0.97,2946.276,2952.249,I had one more item unrelated to this.,90,,
447,0.97,2952.249,2953.517,Would you like me to wait?,90,,
448,0.97,2953.517,2954.918,Is there any other comments?,91,,
449,0.97,2954.918,2958.221,"That bill sounds like there has been great dialogue, and folks will continue working on possible amendments.",91,,
450,0.97,2958.221,2961.158,I can give a brief update when I get my overall.,92,,
451,0.97,2961.158,2967.264,Great.,93,,
452,0.97,2967.264,2968.398,"Councilmember Sawant, please continue.",94,,
453,0.97,2968.398,2968.932,Thank you.,95,,
454,0.97,2968.932,2995.759,"Also on today's agenda, which is the first item on resolution 31926, which is the resolution my office has produced opposing what is called the National register of citizens, and the citizenship amendment act in India.",95,,
455,0.97,2995.759,2997.894,"In combination, these two policies are extremely discriminatory, and quite dangerous.",95,,
456,0.97,2997.894,3005.302,"They threatened to strip, literally, not only the 200 million Muslims, who live in India, but also hundreds of millions of other marginalized people, Includin Lgbtq people, and especially Trans people who are very vulnerable to this.",95,,
457,0.97,3005.302,3006.303,Women are memorable to this.,95,,
458,0.97,3006.303,3009.773,Oppressed Castes are eligible and vulnerable.,95,,
459,0.97,3009.773,3024.388,"Hundreds of thousands will be stripped of citizenship, and Thedemocratic rights system alongside being a citizen, so this is extremely disturbing, and they are very reminiscent of the early Nuremberg laws of the 1930s, the third Reich Germany.",95,,
460,0.97,3024.388,3032.295,"It is crucial that the global community that is fighting against the right-wing, take a stand on this.",95,,
461,0.97,3032.295,3047.411,"I'm sure my staff have informed you all that there are also resolutions in the European Union being considered, so we are in good company alongside the United Nations, and amnesty International, who have both been very clear that these laws are going to be extremely detrimental to democratic rights.",95,,
462,0.97,3047.411,3058.522,"This is the biggest democracy in the world, so we should be taking a position against this.",95,,
463,0.97,3058.522,3060.757,It's not something removed from Seattle and the United States.,95,,
464,0.97,3060.757,3072.369,"Seattle has been very clear about its position against Trump's Islamophobia, attacks on immigrant rights, especially the horrendous internment camps of the U.S.-Mexico border.",95,,
465,0.97,3072.369,3085.415,"I believe this resolution is very much consistent with our position against the Trump agenda, and Conversely, if we didn't pass this resolution, it would really bring up the question of how exactly we are against Trump because, if we are against the right-wing, we have to be against the Right- wing everywhere.",95,,
466,0.97,3085.415,3101.565,"Just to share with you, the Reconstructionist Jewish community, and the city of Seattle Lgbtq Commissioner, and the many organizations that have issued formal statements, in support of the resolution.",95,,
467,0.97,3101.565,3110.073,"I am happy to give more information, but I will reserve for the comments for city council.",95,,
468,0.97,3110.073,3110.373,Broke into.,95,,
469,0.97,3110.373,3110.74,I apologize.,95,,
470,0.97,3110.74,3114.811,I think I misread notes from last week and missed the opportunity to vote on the walk from city.,95,,
471,0.97,3120.35,3120.917,Any other comments?,95,,
472,0.97,3120.917,3123.92,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",95,,
473,0.97,3123.92,3124.387,Councilmember Lewis.,95,,

485,0.97,3192.956,3209.606,"From my conversation with central staff, folks have been very efficient in getting things to frame, and start working on, so it doesn't sound like my constant reminders have been effective in that respect.",99,,
486,0.97,3209.606,3226.99,"But we had a really good conversation on that ordinance during the committee meeting last month, so I do anticipate that everyone should be fully prepared on February 10 after full Council to talk about that ordinance.",99,,

511,0.97,3434.497,3443.44,"I just want to be clear, and some of the comments that we've gotten from other Council offices, the idea would be to create a new fund that would be in addition to existing rental assistance resources, not in place of moving things around.",99,,
512,0.97,3443.44,3463.96,"Sort of by design, based on how the winter Eviction ordinance has been written as a defense of Eviction proceedings, if more traditional medication funds had been obtained, the Eviction proceeding probably wouldn't be receiving in the first place.",99,,
513,0.97,3463.96,3472.869,"Under the just causes that were allowed, it's sort of written in any way that it will be supplemental to existing sources of support, but we made that more explicit just to make it clear.",99,,
514,0.97,3472.869,3475.538,That's how it would be administered.,99,,
