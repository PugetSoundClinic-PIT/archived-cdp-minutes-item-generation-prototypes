974,0.8895019292831421,5657.4,5666.3,"I do think that when we are talking about housing infrastructure, it's important for us to acknowledge in the context of",,,

978,0.9024378657341003,5696.4,5696.7, Space.,,,
979,0.9024378657341003,5696.7,5705.8,"Some land use, we know that land use is one of those areas where public comment and public testimony, and public engagement, is a corner storm.",,,

981,0.9024378657341003,5710.3,5722.4,"And as a result of that, this bill I see as, as a response to the realities, to our new reality of not being able to engage in that work, the way that we would ordinarily.",,,
982,0.9024378657341003,5722.4,5726.2,So I absolutely suppose support the,,,
983,0.6890097856521606,5726.3,5732.4, Policy and at this juncture can't support this particular Amendment.,,,
984,0.6890097856521606,5732.4,5740.8,But am looking forward to seeing the seeing how we can continue the conversation if this amendment does pass?,,,

1004,0.8435307145118713,5839.4,5843.9,I think frankly I have gone back and forth in my own mind on this particular issue.,,,
1005,0.8435307145118713,5843.9,5851.2,I think that that reasonable Minds can disagree and differ in terms of the the conclusion in this particular space.,,,
1006,0.8435307145118713,5851.2,5855.7,So I do appreciate the opportunity to have a really respectful conversation and too,,,

1070,0.774893581867218,6163.0,6168.8,Strauss for providing more time for the public to consider this complex land.,,,

1072,0.774893581867218,6171.6,6174.1,I also want to thank my other Council.,,,
1073,0.8751587271690369,6174.3,6179.3, Colleagues for digging into this and offering amendments to try to make the legislation better.,,,
1074,0.8751587271690369,6179.7,6183.5,"Thanks to our Central staff, analyst for rapidly organizing those amendments.",,,
1075,0.8751587271690369,6183.9,6197.1,"Over the past couple of weeks, our office heard from both supporters and opponents of this legislation, the supporters of the legislation seem to be mainly from the real estate, real estate development industry.",,,
1076,0.8751587271690369,6197.3,6201.1,And I want to State for the record by concerns with the legislation.,,,
1077,0.9098525047302246,6204.2,6217.1, So the bill is presented as an emergency and based on my experience managing analysts in the field of commercial real estate and invent working with investors.,,,
1078,0.9098525047302246,6217.8,6225.0,I do find it hard to believe that that projects that we cannot solve the technological challenge.,,,
1079,0.9098525047302246,6225.0,6229.7,That we have here for design review and are highly Advanced Tech City.,,,
1080,0.9128382205963135,6231.0,6250.4," I feel that I'm concerned that when there isn't an opportunity to pour the public to weigh in that, the quality of the housing can go down, there can be even we heard concerns from some constituents about economic displacement.",,,
1081,0.9128382205963135,6251.1,6254.5,"And so, I think that's that's very serious.",,,
1082,0.9128382205963135,6254.6,6260.2,"And I want to put that concern out on the table, it was mentioned before.",,,
1083,0.7731044888496399,6260.3,6267.2," Low income, tenants deserve the benefits of design review, including administrative design review.",,,
1084,0.7731044888496399,6267.2,6279.1,"And so, I think that again quality housing, sometimes software is, when there's not that public input in the public input has been watered down over the past few years.",,,
1085,0.7731044888496399,6279.3,6281.7,I think that's important context to have here.,,,
1086,0.7731044888496399,6282.2,6290.2,"And ultimately, you know, there have been amendments the substitutes, but no, no matter how many times we",,,
1087,0.8835089206695557,6290.3,6291.6, Try to amend this bill.,,,
1088,0.8835089206695557,6291.6,6301.0,"We're stuck with the official title of the legislation, which literally declares an emergency, I think councilmember her bold really laid it out.",,,
1089,0.8835089206695557,6301.0,6311.1,"Well, in terms of her concern about the governor's Proclamation and the Washington State Attorney General's interpretation of that, there's some additional Nuance here.",,,
1090,0.8835089206695557,6311.1,6315.8,We're also invoking the emergency under the city Charter.,,,
1091,0.8965787887573242,6316.4,6331.8," City charter title for Section 1 which states when an emergency exists in which it is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public, peace health or safety, that an ordinance shall become effective without DeLay.",,,
1092,0.8965787887573242,6332.1,6344.8,So this ordinance is invoking that and I'm concerned about that asserting that there's an emergency and emergency need to essentially water down the process of public input for Real Estate development.,,,
1093,0.8254654407501221,6347.1,6349.2, Our city is a world leader in technology.,,,
1094,0.8254654407501221,6349.2,6355.4,I again I think others may find it hard to believe that we don't have the technological means to fix this.,,,
1095,0.8254654407501221,6355.6,6369.6,"I'm concerned it will not survive Louver, legal scrutiny or challenged in the courts and ironically a legal challenge could result in the opposite goal of this bill because any legal challenge would create even longer delays.",,,
1096,0.8254654407501221,6370.0,6375.1,"So, I just want to put these concerns out on the table and we'll be voting no on this legislation.",,,
1097,0.8254654407501221,6375.1,6375.6,Thank you.,,,
1098,0.8522196412086487,6377.1,6383.5," Thank you councilmember Peterson for those comments, councilmember most data and then we will hear from Kent's, murder Louis.",,,
1099,0.8001140356063843,6384.7,6386.4," Thank you, madam president.",,,
1100,0.8001140356063843,6386.4,6389.1,And I want to thank councilmember her bold.,,,
1101,0.8001140356063843,6389.1,6396.5,I think that the legislation that has now been amended with your amendment number three in the underlying Bill.,,,
1102,0.8001140356063843,6396.5,6397.9,If I have the amendment numbers.,,,
1103,0.8001140356063843,6397.9,6402.8,Correct was a strong addition to the legislation.,,,
1104,0.8001140356063843,6402.8,6410.0,And I want to thank the prime sponsor counseling where Strauss for all of your work with got some of her bald Council Morales myself.,,,
1105,0.8001140356063843,6410.0,6414.3,And I know a number of others have been trying to work to the extent possible.,,,
1106,0.894798994064331,6414.3,6417.2, Roll of various amendments into the provision there.,,,
1107,0.894798994064331,6417.2,6425.8,So one to really underscore my appreciation for all of our colleagues and specifically to the good member from District 1.,,,
1108,0.894798994064331,6425.8,6428.4,I definitely did not mean to impugn any motives.,,,
1109,0.894798994064331,6428.4,6430.7,"I know that, you know that housing is a health care issue.",,,
1110,0.894798994064331,6430.7,6442.2,"I think as council president Gonzalez said eloquently perhaps different reasonable Minds, can differ on what the definition of now might be given the length of the covid crisis.",,,
1111,0.894798994064331,6442.2,6444.1,So appreciate your clarification on that.,,,
1112,0.8012552261352539,6444.3,6447.5, I definitely want to underscore how strong of a housing Advocate.,,,
