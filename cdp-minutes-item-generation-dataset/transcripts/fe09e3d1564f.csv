19,0.97,55.288,72.205,"In today's committee meeting we will be discussing bills to close the just cause loophole from the just cause Eviction notice from the city and a bill to ban school Evictions of school children, their families and educators.",15,,
20,0.97,72.205,123.723,"As with our last meeting on April 27th, today is a Údiscussion only with the set O great Communally analyst a given time and many of them during the work day to speak to us at the next meeting of the Sustainability and Renters' rights Committee on May 25th and hoping we can take up amendments and vote on the bills . We have two just cause build before the committee has members know and one that my office introduced another introduced by Councilmember Morales which we are Cosponsoring and the two just cause bills aim to close the current loophole that landlords have exploited although they take a different legal approach and as we go through discussion today and beyond am looking forward to working with Councilmember Morales and other Councilmembers in this Committee and on city Council to pass the bill, the strongest possible bill that closes the loophole without exception.",15,,
21,0.97,123.723,124.958,This is what Renters urgently need and that is our goal.,15,,
22,0.97,124.958,129.162,And most importantly to witness we need Renters to get organized.,15,,
23,0.97,129.162,159.158,"After we hear from our community panel which is our first agenda item, I shall have staff presenting on two just cause bills and given Councilmember Morales put forward one of the bills I invite her to give her opening remarks before the presentation in agenda item 2. we meet today just 50 days, less than two months from the end of the current city and state moratoriums on Evictions.",15,,
24,0.97,159.158,176.843,As you although the mayors moratorium declaration ends on June 30th and last month Democrats and Republicans in the state legislator directed that the state moratorium and on June 30th as well.,15,,
25,0.97,176.843,192.091,"There is no question we hope our movement can pressure Mayor Durkan to extend the current moratorium be on June 30th, but that task has become much more difficult with the state Legislature action . It is extremely unfortunate but this is what the state and political establishment has done.",15,,
26,0.97,192.091,212.078,"Unless Mayor Durkan and Governor Jay Inslee act to extend these moratoriums then on July 1ST, thousand of Seattle Renters and 150,000 Renters Throughou Washington State who are behind on rent according to the U.S. Census Bureau will be in greater jeopardy than they are already of losing their housing.",15,,
27,0.97,212.078,243.309,This is why it is urgent that we act to pass not only the closing of the loophole in the just cause Eviction ordinance and also the others Renters rights legislation that my office has announced . We know the corporate landlords are gearing up to file huge numbers of Evictions against struggling tenants as soon as the moratoriums and and this is the appalling news that our Council office has been hearing from Renters who have been reaching out to us in greater numbers in recent weeks.,15,,
28,0.97,243.309,259.492,They say that corporate landlords are claiming that as soon as the moratorium is lifted they will go to court to file objections even though Renters are still struggling from the unprecedented crisis of this past year.,15,,
29,0.97,259.492,278.044,"They wrote to us,, quote,, I am an 85-Year-Old senior whose rent has gone up nearly--yearly so high it takes up 90% of my social security income and with $125 a month is due when the moratorium ends I don't know how I will pay It., end quote.",15,,
30,0.97,278.044,289.956,"Leslie told us,, quote,, as a property manager in the area of the last 20 years I have seen firsthand relentless rent increases done just because the owner can.",15,,
31,0.97,289.956,302.535,"For the last 10 years I ran a business and I know the profit loss and breakdown annually and with the rental income of roughly $80,000 a month left salaries, maintenance, insurance, property Tech it's, the profits are still enormous.",15,,
32,0.97,302.535,319.585,I was subjected daily to the owners by being told she didn't have enough money for whatever is needed to be done and quite frankly I was glad I was laid off in December because the first thing she will do when the moratorium is lifted is a victim a few that are behind in rent.,15,,
33,0.97,319.585,326.959,I let my full support to these measures and that Councilwoman Sawant has put forward.,15,,
34,0.97,326.959,337.17,These and other members we hear from our frightened but as is obvious they are also organizing and joining up with our office and with rental advocates and with Socialist than fighting back.,15,,
35,0.97,337.17,363.262,More than 560 community members have signed our community petition calling for the city Council to close the just cause loophole including 100 people who signed just this morning when they heard about this afternoon's committee meeting and I really appreciate community members being engaged.,15,,
36,0.97,363.262,364.931,Let's be clear the problem lies almost exclusively with corporate landlords.,15,,
37,0.97,364.931,365.365,It's not rhetoric.,15,,
38,0.97,365.365,366.299,Its nationwide data that indicates this.,15,,
39,0.97,366.299,378.077,And this is a matter of both economic and racial justice as black and Brown tenants are subjected to Eviction threats at much higher rates than other tenants.,15,,
40,0.97,378.077,383.015,You might think with local state and national Eviction moratoriums in place that corporate landlords would put off conviction filings but you would be wrong in thinking that.,15,,
41,0.97,383.015,401.901,"As the corporate watchdog group recently reported, even stated national Eviction moratoriums and affect private equity firms and other corporate landlords are still insisting on Evicting families during the pandemic particularly families of color.",15,,
42,0.97,401.901,409.709,"And we have more data that I will go over later, but we know that even in Seattle the situation is no different according to the housing justice project.",15,,
43,0.97,409.709,421.454,Landlords have filed 400 Eviction notices since Covid began last year and we have absolutely every political obligation and moral Habitation to stop the corporate landlord Eviction tsunami.,15,,
44,0.97,421.454,442.208,"I am grateful to the community panel of Renters who will be here today to describe how it is affecting them, why the loophole should be closed, and also add as I did at the last committee that my staff and I have directly spoken with dozens of tenants who work with us to close the loophole including newly activated tenants.",15,,
45,0.97,442.208,456.556,I'm really happy that we have Councilmembers Morales and Lewis both having publicly stated support for closing the just cause loophole and we will be discussing both legislation today.,15,,
46,0.97,456.556,459.091,And this is what tenants have been calling for.,15,,
47,0.97,459.091,489.188,We have seen that we absolutely will lead a Renter led movement to make sure we close the loophole and we have seen repeatedly how insider negotiations can result in a Watered-Down bill but does not protect all tenants and we just saw this with the state house bill 1236 which was just cause statewide which is important then leaves gaping loopholes for corporate landlords to exploit.,15,,
48,0.97,489.188,501.467,"Also this afternoon we get a report on the bill that my office introduced banning Schoolyard Evictions for school children, families and educators.",15,,
49,0.97,501.467,511.677,And I will describe that bill in more detail when we come to that agenda item but I want to make sure we get to the public comments as soon as possible.,15,,
50,0.97,511.677,513.279,Which is something we will go over before we begin our agenda items.,15,,
51,0.97,513.279,536.135,I will read the names of the people who are signed up in public comments in order of their signing up and because of the numbers of people who signed up we will have one minute for each Speaker to be able to make sure we get through and at this moment I hope we get through all of the speakers.,15,,
52,0.97,536.135,539.171,We have 32 people signed up although not everyone is present at the moment but I'll make sure to call everyone who is present.,15,,
53,0.97,539.171,543.876,So I hope the public comment sign of people have heard that you all have one minute to speak.,15,,
54,0.97,543.876,545.711,Our first Speaker is Daniel Cavanaugh.,15,,
55,0.97,545.711,550.716,Please go ahead.,15,,

57,0.97,558.124,570.636,I am a Renter and a member of the alternative and want to thank Councilmember Sawant for fighting for United approach to win and close the loopholes and just cause Eviction sections.,16,,
58,0.97,570.636,614.413,"Proposing her own bill, and also Cosponsoring with this bill and we need an approach that can win the strongest protections against Eviction and the movement is weak when it's divided and strong when it's United so I really applaud Councilmember Sawant and I want to urge they pass the strongest protections on both bills before you today in closing the loophole fully and I want to urge Councilmember to support the bill banning Evictions of school children and their families during the school year which has been supported unanimously by the Seattle education Association.",16,,
59,0.97,614.413,618.651,Thank you.,17,,
60,0.97,618.651,624.49,We have Angie next followed by Margo Stewart.,17,,

65,0.97,644.11,653.886,The presentations come out reach or analysis to fight the resin mendacious in the city 2018 rental housing study.,19,,
66,0.97,653.886,656.555,Your policy is Backfiring with many negative impacts were Renters.,19,,
67,0.97,656.555,670.336,"In April, Council President was quoted on Seattle channel saying she is not aware of any studies or Statistics that support the theory that increase tenant regulations deplete inventory in the city.",19,,
68,0.97,670.336,675.641,Ask Sdci and local real estate agents how many small Community- based rentals are disappearing from the market.,19,,
69,0.97,675.641,683.182,While you rail against greedy corporations or policies only create advantages for them soaking greater inequity a few options for local Renters.,19,,
70,0.97,683.182,695.795,It's Pejorative and misleading for these loopholes.,19,,
71,0.97,695.795,697.363,Council should not move ahead with the bills under consideration today.,19,,
72,0.97,697.363,699.231,To improve conditions for Renters you need to collaborate with local housing providers.,19,,

76,0.97,713.245,733.766,My name is Margo and I'm a Renter in the central district and calling to support Councilmember Sawant's resolution to close the Loop are in the just cause Eviction law and I please Councilmember Morales put forth the bill and it was cosponsored and that's the kind of unified approach we need to win victories for Renters and also means organizing directly among Renters and tenants looking to bring the movement into City Hall as Councilmember Sawant has done.,21,,
77,0.97,733.766,756.155,"But closing the loophole which is what it is will be crucial to keeping people housed in the midst of the ongoing crisis, especially the summer is corporate landlords who are the primary Effectors and raising rent at double the National rate locally are looking for ways to Jack up rents between now that the moratorium is ending.",21,,
78,0.97,756.155,768.1,"And a Long-Standing housing crisis and we need other measures to fight at like six months notice for rent HIKES, barring legalized discrimination and canceling dead and fighting for universal rent control for tenants and small businesses.",21,,

83,0.97,794.126,804.703,It's urgent we close the loophole now before the Eviction moratorium expires on June 30th.,23,,
84,0.97,804.703,820.986,Many tenants are still Stuggling under the crisis of Covid-19 and the economic concessions and without just cause protection when he could find themselves a bit and just Úbecause corporate landlords want to increase profits by 10 to find the city.,23,,
85,0.97,820.986,832.865,There are two bills under consideration that take different approaches to close the just cause loophole and I urge the committee to listen to Councilmember Sawant to take a unified approach combining the best elements of both pieces of legislation so all tenants are protected.,23,,
86,0.97,832.932,844.376,E must also Recogni take a fighting movement to win a just cause legislation and already more than 460 Renters have signed the petition that Councilmember Sawant's office and we need to build a movement and take a unified approach if we want to win this and stand up to corporate landlords.,23,,

98,0.97,898.53,914.647,It doesn't even make sense that a landlord has to provide one of the 16 just cause reasons to Evict someone if someone is on a month to month but not if they are on a term lease.,27,,
99,0.97,914.647,926.625,It seems like an easy fix just to change especially as we know that nine out of 10 people evicted become homeless . and I think everyone can agree that we have a homelessness crisis.,27,,
100,0.97,926.625,929.762,"It seems like an easy thing to do, to at least keep people in homes in their homes.",27,,
101,0.97,929.762,942.508,I work in a shelter and I see firsthand the devastating effect of Evictions and I am also a peer counselor and one of the first things we learn about recovery is that the house is really important.,27,,

118,0.97,1057.056,1072.738,The transit riders Union strongly supports the bill and closing the fixed term loophole in the Seattle just cause Eviction ordinance.,31,,
119,0.97,1072.738,1086.318,"Many members are impacted by the pandemic with rental data multiple Evictions and as we emerge from the pandemic and so many Renters are in the situation, there's a danger that landlords will use the loophole to kick Renters out when leases and.",31,,
120,0.97,1086.318,1087.619,That way they'll have to say it's about Covid rental debts.,31,,
121,0.97,1087.619,1100.299,With the rental assistant program still being set up it's important Renters are protected so landlords make the effort to access rental assistance and maintain tenancy rather than resorting to Evictions leading to homelessness and not just about the pandemic.,31,,
122,0.97,1100.299,1103.569,All Renters should be protected from discriminatory and arbitrary Eviction.,31,,

148,0.97,1251.316,1258.857,My name is matt and I'm a Renter in district 2. I agree with a lot of what has been said.,40,,
149,0.97,1258.857,1266.431,There's been a massive abuse of power by big landlords for many years in Seattle.,40,,
150,0.97,1266.431,1268.2,We have seen a fundamental power imbalance between Renters and corporate landlords.,40,,
151,0.97,1268.2,1272.971,Corporate landlords being the biggest driver of Evictions in the city.,40,,
152,0.97,1272.971,1275.374,We have a housing Pike crisis in the city.,40,,
153,0.97,1275.374,1308.507,"Seattle landlords are Evicting three households a day on average a many of those, the overwhelming majority households are on the breach of homelessness and the just cause legislation that is being introduced by Councilmember Sawant, by Councilmember Morales, it is a critical lifeline to Renters and to changing that power imbalance.",40,,
154,0.97,1308.507,1312.978,I want to thank the previous speakers for letting us know about the rally on May 27th at 6:00 at Platte park and I will absolutely be there and encourage everyone to join us.,40,,
155,0.97,1312.978,1313.845,Sarah followed by Matthew Wilder.,41,,
156,0.97,1313.845,1321.453,"Go ahead, Sarah.",41,,
157,0.97,1321.453,1326.758,My name is Sarah.,42,,
158,0.97,1326.758,1344.176,"I live in Seattle my whole life and I lived two years so I encourage the Council to pass this legislation closing the loophole, the just cause loophole.",42,,
159,0.97,1344.176,1345.077,And I have a personal story about this.,42,,
160,0.97,1345.077,1365.464,"I used to live in the neighborhood and I had a bunch of roommates and we found mold and instead of incurring the cost associated with dealing with that, the landlord just decided he would have us all leave because there were only two months left on the lease.",42,,
161,0.97,1365.464,1373.605,So we were all basically evicted because we found an issue in the house.,42,,
162,0.97,1373.605,1376.742,So this was after a verbal agreement that we would renew the lease.,42,,
163,0.97,1376.742,1384.082,And in 2017 when it was really competitive to find a good rental at a fair price.,42,,
164,0.97,1384.082,1385.65,So a major disruption to all of us.,42,,
165,0.97,1385.65,1406.071,And the landlord had us live there for two more months with the health hazard and didn't refund any rent to move early or anything like that and then took a month to fix the place up and rendered it out again and notably at a higher price.,42,,
166,0.97,1406.071,1408.807,Basically every time I have moved it has been because of the will of the landlord.,42,,
167,0.97,1408.807,1409.441,I'm sorry.,43,,
168,0.97,1409.441,1413.578,We had to keep moving.,43,,
169,0.97,1413.578,1421.987,"But Sarah, Centerfold, to my office and we will definitely want to read it.",43,,
170,0.97,1421.987,1423.255,Next we have Matthew Wilder followed by Leslie Mathis.,43,,
171,0.97,1423.255,1426.758,"Go ahead, Matthew.",43,,
172,0.97,1426.758,1433.265,My name is matt and I am a Renter in district 3. I'm calling in support of closing the just cause loophole.,44,,
173,0.97,1433.265,1451.082,I think we also need to keep holding the movement for Renters and beyond that to require the landlord's provider 180 days notice before increasing rents of attendance and band Evictions of families of schoolchildren.,44,,
174,0.97,1451.082,1456.955,Also rent control for struggling small businesses.,44,,
175,0.97,1456.955,1466.531,And we need to continue to build the movement as well and encourage people to join us all at the rights rally we are holding a may 27th at 6:00 at Platte park.,44,,
176,0.97,1466.531,1466.965,That's all I have.,44,,
177,0.97,1466.965,1471.937,Thank you.,44,,

182,0.97,1483.081,1491.189,I live in district 6. I am calling to ask you to support Seattle rent control.,46,,
183,0.97,1491.189,1500.432,"I want to thank you, Councilwoman Sawant for your leadership in creating the movement which invested in concrete community benefits.",46,,
184,0.97,1500.432,1509.941,I have been a property manager in district 3 for the last 20 years working for a private landlord and not a corporate landlord.,46,,
185,0.97,1509.941,1540.538,"As I gained more responsibility over those years I got an Hands- on understanding of the profit generated by rental income less expenses, like salaries, maintenance, property taxes, insurance, and since I was also in charge of marketing, I was constantly assailed by the owner that's quoting one professional periodical Avenue that she raised rents just because she could.",46,,
186,0.97,1540.538,1548.179,"And I want to say that I urge you to support the community at large as you did by supporting the Amazon tax, the 15 hour minimum wage and the efforts to achieve police accountability.",46,,
187,0.97,1548.179,1549.514,Thank you.,46,,
188,0.97,1549.514,1559.024,Madeleine Olson followed by [name Indiscernible].,47,,
189,0.97,1559.024,1559.925,"Hi, can you hear me okay?",48,,
190,0.97,1559.925,1560.225,Yes.,49,,
191,0.97,1560.225,1586.184,"I am Madeleine and I am have support for just cause loophole as well as the ban on Evictions of schoolchildren, families and teachers during the school year and concern about the legislation being discussed, landlord but loophole required's same standard is month to month rentals and legally justify the cause for Eviction and it's a common thing as others have said.",50,,
192,0.97,1586.184,1596.928,Holding all landlords to the same standard is room for large corporate landlords to export loopholes and not the other way around.,50,,
193,0.97,1596.928,1605.57,Is vital we cooperate so thank you Councilmember Sawant for putting forth the ban on school and Cosponsoring the bill with Councilmember Morales.,50,,
194,0.97,1605.57,1607.539,We all win by fighting together want to thank everyone for showing up today.,50,,
195,0.97,1607.539,1619.985,We all need to be involved in continuing the movement to invite protection to minimize what we know a Bm massive Eviction tsunami.,50,,
196,0.97,1619.985,1632.23,It's only the first step and we need to keep fighting for protection of any rent control for residential commercial rentals at six months notice of rent increase and Covid relief in the form of canceling mortgages utility payments for folks who lost income.,50,,
197,0.97,1632.23,1637.469,Go ahead.,51,,
198,0.97,1637.469,1651.516,My name is Solomon and I'm a Renter in district 3 calling in strong support of closing the just cause Eviction ordinance loophole.,52,,
199,0.97,1651.516,1655.086,Am an attorney working for tenants day in and day out I've seen a significant harm that Evictions have on individuals and families during the Covid- 19 pandemic.,52,,
200,0.97,1655.086,1665.463,I'm sure as you all know Evictions disproportionately impact communities of color especially black women.,52,,
201,0.97,1665.463,1670.235,As the leader in the field of Evictions study said if Incarceration came to define the lives of men than Evictions was shaping the lives of women.,52,,
202,0.97,1670.235,1685.417,Poor black women were--poor black men were locked up while poor black women were--this is true around the United States and in Seattle.,52,,
203,0.97,1685.417,1688.72,The study found that the black women made up approximately 6.1% of the Seattle population they represented 33% of Evictions in Seattle.,52,,
204,0.97,1688.72,1698.163,Now is the time if there was one to close the just cause Eviction ordinances.,52,,
205,0.97,1698.163,1703.334,Go ahead.,53,,
206,0.97,1703.334,1705.136,Good afternoon.,54,,

208,0.97,1718.483,1727.325,With moratorium coming to an end we heard across the city about how they will be removed from the lease using the loophole.,54,,
209,0.97,1727.325,1736.935,I've been working with a Renter and he will be evicted on July 1ST and he will become homeless and die on the street.,54,,
210,0.97,1736.935,1737.669,I know is not the only one.,54,,
211,0.97,1737.669,1755.887,Seattle started long before Covid-19 a will remain long after and the temporary a moratorium protection 4000 Renters losing their home in the middle of a global pandemic but now we need a permanent long-term solution.,54,,
212,0.97,1755.887,1758.189,We asked the committee to support the recommended passage of the Council bill to the full city council.,54,,
213,0.97,1758.189,1761.126,Thank you.,54,,

216,0.97,1773.905,1799.23,As a working mom of two teenagers and a landlord myself I support Councilmember Sawant's just cause legislation to ban Evictions of schoolchildren and educators through the school year and I urge you to pass it without delay and loopholes . I think it's absolutely unconscionable to Evict someone with no justification especially kids and their families and a stunning indictment of society we have to fight so hard to ban it.,56,,
217,0.97,1799.23,1800.999,Also glad to see the press conference on residential and commercial rent control.,56,,
218,0.97,1800.999,1814.779,We really do need to fill the demand to cancel Covid that because corporate landlords are wealthy people won't pay for this and we will we know they are not paying their fair share.,56,,
219,0.97,1814.779,1821.186,I was glad to see these two bills as mentioned by others.,56,,
220,0.97,1821.186,1831.396,We really need that kind of unified approach to win victory for Renters and we also need to organize directly for the movement in city hall as Councilmember Sawant has done.,56,,

226,0.97,1864.729,1877.742,We are part of the stay hard and healthy coalition up and working with Councilmember Morales his office him we support and recommend the passage of the bill which is developed by community Stakeholders including the housing justice project to the full city council.,58,,
227,0.97,1877.742,1886.284,Lawmakers have moved forward to pass along to help communities without giving input from the community members.,58,,
228,0.97,1886.284,1895.526,Cb 12 0057 has the rental community input and support of protection is long overdue.,58,,
229,0.97,1895.526,1902.967,With a moratorium coming to an and we need to act quickly to protect Renters from landlords with additional addiction filings.,58,,
230,0.97,1902.967,1910.575,They should not face homelessness as a result of loopholes especially not when the moratorium comes to an end.,58,,

241,0.97,1958.289,1968.733,This afternoon opposing this ordinance.,63,,
242,0.97,1968.733,1970.535,"First and foremost, the most important missed opportunity is for Stakeholder process.",63,,
243,0.97,1970.535,1974.138,It's necessary to hear the voice of all those impacted by this bill.,63,,
244,0.97,1974.138,1987.652,"Secondly, there would be a practical end of using fixed term leases resulting in housing and security.",63,,
245,0.97,1987.652,1994.759,It will disrupt seasonal housing reducing opportunities for tenants who seek to rent out units for less than a year.,63,,
246,0.97,1994.759,1999.831,And allowing that to continue for more than 10 months would put tenants severely behind and unable to pay rent during two months of the year.,63,,
247,0.97,1999.831,2000.398,Thank you.,63,,
248,0.97,2000.398,2004.669,Molly followed by Peter.,64,,

250,0.97,2009.874,2015.713,Hello.,65,,
251,0.97,2015.713,2031.129,My name is Molly Dawson and I'm a Renter in district 4. I'm calling in today to support Councilmember Morales bill of rights registration to close the fixed term loophole in the just cause Eviction ordinance.,65,,
252,0.97,2031.129,2036.267,According to the housing justice project report on Upton County addiction filings in 2019 Seattle had the second highest number of No-Cost filings.,65,,
253,0.97,2036.267,2048.946,In Seattle Renters face Evictions at the same rate as white women even though they account for only 32% of Seattle Renters while white Renters account for 60%.,65,,
254,0.97,2048.946,2056.621,Failure to close the loophole allows landlords to Sidestep the just cause Eviction ordinance and support tenants from their homes without cause.,65,,
255,0.97,2056.621,2061.659,Councilmember Morales and the legislation closes the loophole ensures the most vulnerable cannot be forced from their homes without cause.,65,,
256,0.97,2061.659,2068.433,I urge Councilmembers to vote yes and support closing this loophole.,65,,
257,0.97,2068.433,2069.1,Peter followed by Jessica.,66,,
258,0.97,2069.1,2074.105,"Go ahead, Peter.",66,,
259,0.97,2074.105,2077.341,Good afternoon.,67,,
260,0.97,2077.341,2078.543,This is Peter.,67,,
261,0.97,2078.543,2084.048,I am calling to support the Council bill 12 0057.,67,,
262,0.97,2084.048,2100.565,"I lived in Seattle for over 30 years and lately I have lived in district 4 both before and during the pandemic, I currently live in Wallingford next to 45Th which is a busy street and the heart of the neighborhood.",67,,
263,0.97,2100.565,2109.073,"I have seen small businesses in my area close, but lately I have seen increased business in my neighborhood.",67,,
264,0.97,2109.073,2129.66,"And I agree with a lot of the reasons that people have given in support of this bill and Councilmember Sawant's bill, but I have not heard--I think another important reason to support the bills is to support small businesses.",67,,
265,0.97,2129.66,2142.106,Most of the people who work at these businesses who have kept their neighborhood running during the pandemic and have kept other neighborhoods running need stability to get back to work and to get rental assistance and that is on the way but not yet here.,67,,
266,0.97,2142.106,2143.908,So they can keep the neighborhoods going and help everyone get back to normal.,67,,
267,0.97,2143.908,2144.842,Thank you and please support these bills.,67,,
268,0.97,2144.842,2147.645,Jessica followed by Glenn.,68,,
269,0.97,2147.645,2152.884,"Go ahead, Jessica.",68,,
270,0.97,2152.884,2161.058,Thank you Councilmembers for your time today.,69,,
271,0.97,2161.058,2178.109,My name is Jessica and I'm a lifelong Renter who's been running for 9 years and a former member of the Renters Commission and former property manager and I'm calling to bring my voice in support of closing the lease term loophole.,69,,
272,0.97,2178.109,2181.579,I want to thank Councilmember Morales for bringing us the extremely important issue to the table and thanks for the cosponsors.,69,,
273,0.97,2181.579,2211.108,"I will be blunt because when we discuss human rights like housing so it's a crisis and people living in current in danger so here's my point, not supporting closing the loophole and just cause Eviction protection is it can to what happens with just cause Eviction protection and in addition not establishing protection said you're willing to ignore landlords used for retaliation and we have to but the loophole makes it useless.",69,,
274,0.97,2211.108,2225.156,Listening to landlords are ready threatening and won't offer fixed term leases if you do this and it's an abuse of power and we try to fix the loophole and they threaten us.,69,,
275,0.97,2225.156,2226.29,Please stand up to them and end the loophole now.,69,,
276,0.97,2226.29,2226.824,Thank you for your time.,69,,

279,0.97,2246.711,2257.054,Good afternoon.,72,,
280,0.97,2262.393,2275.806,I would like to encourage all the Renters out there to start a campaign to register all the Renters to make sure everyone is registered to vote.,72,,
281,0.97,2275.806,2276.24,That's one thing.,72,,
282,0.97,2276.24,2291.656,The second thing is I encourage is to not let have a tax break when they start their tax break.,72,,
283,0.97,2291.656,2301.065,So they can start to a tax rate like five years ago and still be paying taxes of five years ago today.,72,,
284,0.97,2301.065,2307.705,So I encourage that to happen and deal with the developers.,72,,
285,0.97,2307.705,2310.875,Thank you.,72,,

288,0.97,2327.591,2348.179,I'm John and the chief strategy officer for the low-income housing Institute and we are regional landlord that owns or operates over 2000 units of rental housing was 70 properties across six counties in the greater Puget sound area with many in Seattle.,74,,
289,0.97,2348.179,2372.436,We are Testifying in support of Councilmember Morales and her proposed ordinance to reform the just cause Eviction ordinance to cover term leases and think committee chair Sawant has the same concerns as the committee and as a property owner we believe requiring just cause is best practice in a policy that helps property owners limit their liability because the policy assists owners comply with existing fair housing laws.,74,,
290,0.97,2372.436,2377.475,This proposed policy has no negative impact on the buildings we own and affect we believe would improve relationships between landlords and tenants by bringing more consistency in how Eviction laws are enforced.,74,,
291,0.97,2377.475,2381.445,We encourage the committee to pass this law.,74,,
292,0.97,2381.445,2382.646,Thank you.,74,,

302,0.97,2431.662,2435.466,As well as a Renter in district 6 and calling to express my support for Council bill 1257.,78,,
303,0.97,2435.466,2449.38,The just cause Eviction ordinance as it is currently written allows landlords to decline extending an offer for a new lease of the original lease doesn't automatically convert to month two months.,78,,
304,0.97,2449.38,2463.727,All essentially allows landlords to disrupt housing for any reason as long as they don't include the month to month conversion language in the original lease . The loopholes completely antithetical to the policy behind just cause Eviction and should be remedied as soon as possible.,78,,
305,0.97,2463.727,2470.367,I hear a lot of landlords claim generally that the increase in tenant protections are hurting their ability to do business.,78,,
306,0.97,2470.367,2482.947,However the rental housing market is the least regulated markets despite that people consider shelter a basic human right.,78,,
307,0.97,2482.947,2485.916,I said at the last public comment and I'll say it again the property rights of the landlord should not usurp human rights of the tenant.,78,,

341,0.97,2727.191,2748.345,"My name is Jordan Van Voast and I am a settler, Homeowner on Amish lantern I speak in solidarity with Councilmember Sawant and the movement for Renters Ricin voice my support for the legislation to close the loophole in just cause lease Eviction laws.",90,,
342,0.97,2748.345,2757.221,The loophole allows landlords to Evict tenants on term leases when they expire without having to state the 16 legally allowed reasons which exist a month two months rent contact.,90,,
343,0.97,2757.221,2783.347,A month ago my older brother was contacted by his landlord who said he wanted to Evict him at the end of his 12 month lease which expires at the end of June.,90,,
344,0.97,2783.347,2805.135,This was extremely unsettling news for my brother who is live with Schizophrenia for over 40 years and during the social stigma that goes with that originally facing rejection and Eviction from the world in a general sense.,90,,
345,0.97,2806.537,2811.542,"Nonetheless, despite his severe and persistent mental illness he is managed to live independently and contribute to society through his artwork which he is donated to several Seattle area hospitals and organizations serving the public.",90,,
346,0.97,2811.542,2819.049,Schizophrenia like many disabilities places individuals in a vulnerable situation in a world where the profits of capitalism are ultimately Prioritized over human and societal well-being.,90,,
347,0.97,2819.049,2833.73,"Due to my white privilege and, I'm in a position to help my brother enable to dialogue with the landlord and help him understand how devastating a potentially destabilizing a forced Eviction could have on my brother.",90,,
348,0.97,2833.73,2840.971,But what about the thousands who are evicted every year in our city?,90,,
349,0.97,2840.971,2841.838,How many of them lack and advocate?,90,,
350,0.97,2841.838,2858.822,How many of them are guilty of no crime other than living in a society which despite paying lip service to social justice and human rights said it's okay to put someone on the street because we can't infringe on the rights of the owning class?,90,,
351,0.97,2858.822,2860.49,How conveniently we forget history when we arrive at these conclusions.,90,,
352,0.97,2860.49,2865.095,The material wealth of the city and country was founded upon slavery and manifest destiny.,90,,
353,0.97,2865.095,2866.196,Eviction of the native Americans from their land.,90,,
354,0.97,2866.196,2871.835,It's built on theft from our children and grandchildren.,90,,
355,0.97,2871.835,2883.046,The so-called free market of capitalism sanctions the pillage and theft of earth resources from mother earth destroying the habitat of other creatures and stealing their homes.,90,,
356,0.97,2883.046,2890.153,"Our laws give us the legal rights to do these things, but if we listen to our hearts we know they don't give us the moral right.",90,,
357,0.97,2890.153,2897.261,How sadly ironic it is that landlords who have inherited privilege and wealth based on stolen land and labor are allowed to Evict people without just cause.,90,,
358,0.97,2897.261,2903.567,What moral justification is there to deny people the right to housing?,90,,
359,0.97,2903.567,2903.967,There is none.,90,,
360,0.97,2903.967,2910.741,"Capitalism, colonialism, patriarchy and white supremacy work together and it's our job to undo their legacy.",90,,
361,0.97,2910.741,2919.95,"A Dakota elder told me we are living in the time of prophecy, devastating climate disasters and Pandemics are two signs at the world is out of balance.",90,,
362,0.97,2919.95,2927.357,We have to make a choice now which road we are going to follow.,90,,
363,0.97,2927.357,2935.766,Some would have us believe that we should stick with business as usual and allow corporations and their political contributions to make the key decisions in our lives.,90,,
364,0.97,2935.766,2939.169,I believe we need to build a society based on compassion that truly leaves no one behind.,90,,
365,0.97,2939.169,2949.012,We need rent control because so many people are forced to leave their homes intercity because rents are Unaffordable.,90,,
366,0.97,2949.012,2956.82,We need a green new deal and real climate solutions of building thousands of environmentally sustainable affordable housing should be part of that but we can't wait for that to happen.,90,,
367,0.97,2956.82,2975.339,"We must be willing to step out of the comfort zone and show up in movements for change utilizing nonviolent action and speech to pressure city Councilmembers to stand with Renters like my brother and pass just cause protection, rent control another Renter protections put forward by Councilmember Sawant and the grassroots movement.",90,,
368,0.97,2975.339,2977.007,Thank you.,90,,
369,0.97,2977.007,2984.848,"Thank you, Jordan and it's totally fine if you have to leave in order to go back to work.",91,,
370,0.97,2984.848,3008.305,I really appreciate you coming year and also your second committee testimony and bringing the message from your brother who is you said like many other members of our disabled communities remain invisible and one of the most disproportionately impacted communities because of the lack of these basic rights for Renters.,91,,
371,0.97,3008.305,3014.344,I am really happy to invite Violet Lavatai next from the tenant Union of Washington.,91,,
372,0.97,3014.344,3016.58,"Welcome, violet.",91,,
373,0.97,3016.58,3020.984,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",92,,
374,0.97,3020.984,3031.728,Am actually here today to talk about closing the Loop holes in this important legislation.,92,,
375,0.97,3031.728,3047.944,The Council bill that was created by Councilmember Morales had community voices all around the table and this is the reason why it is so important to close these loopholes.,92,,
376,0.97,3047.944,3065.462,"We have many calls from tenants from all over the state of Washington about getting served these 20 date notices, so we are happy that through the state of Washington, they have now passed statewide just cause.",92,,
377,0.97,3065.462,3075.305,"There is a lot of things that are coming out of having just cause, but the thing is some of these loopholes we need to close them now.",92,,
378,0.97,3075.305,3080.444,Because it people always ask me why is it so important to have just cause?,92,,
379,0.97,3080.444,3088.351,"Because we know if you are staying in a place and you are not on the lease, in 20 days, a landlord can ask you to leave for no reason.",92,,
380,0.97,3088.351,3101.164,"Communities of color are experiencing the highest rate of either intimidation or bullying through these no cause notices, and it adds to our homeless population.",92,,
381,0.97,3101.164,3127.39,"Closing these loopholes, I read the Council bill 120057 which was introduced by Councilmember Morales, and I think you Councilmember Lewis and Councilmember Sawant to engage and uplift these Legislations that are so important to our communities.",92,,
382,0.97,3127.39,3140.27,The majority of communities that feel the crunch that are being asked to lead through these loopholes are communities of color.,92,,
383,0.97,3140.27,3148.512,"African Americans have the highest rate of Evictions in our state, and I would not be surprised if it's in our nation.",92,,
384,0.97,3148.512,3156.052,We are asking Councilmembers to support this legislation of Councilmember Juarez another Councilmembers to support this legislation.,92,,
385,0.97,3156.052,3159.322,It is good for the community.,92,,
386,0.97,3159.322,3165.829,"I give a lot of calls from landlords who are angry at that tenant Union, but I do not lose sleep over that.",92,,
387,0.97,3165.829,3173.236,"But here's the thing, are there are bad landlords in the state of Washington?",92,,
388,0.97,3173.236,3177.34,There are actually I can tell you there are good landlords.,92,,
389,0.97,3177.34,3180.076,We just don't have enough of them.,92,,
390,0.97,3180.076,3196.293,"And I think one of the things that we fight every day and why the tenant Union exists is tenant protection to be protective over people who are feeling the crunch on this housing disparity, even before the pandemic.",92,,
391,0.97,3196.293,3211.341,"We had many people who are losing their housing and were actually--some of these 20 date notices if we don't close the loopholes, some of them end up on the streets or end up in their cars.",92,,
392,0.97,3211.341,3216.079,Housing advocates will tell you firsthand that housing should be a human right.,92,,
393,0.97,3216.079,3224.688,And I think closing the Loop holes is having the community surround to bring the voices of everyone.,92,,
394,0.97,3224.688,3228.992,Landlords are on a lot of coalitions that we are on.,92,,
395,0.97,3228.992,3244.641,"To say that their voices are not heard, if you look at legislation and go back and look at all of these Legislations, and was actually written by the opposing landlords and everybody.",92,,
396,0.97,3244.641,3245.075,So here we are.,92,,
397,0.97,3245.075,3253.984,"Years later, 2021, fighting for more rights to be protected and not to get over on the landlords but to have an even playing field.",92,,
398,0.97,3253.984,3283.146,"Today I got a call from an Army veteran who was asked to leave and I reminded him that under the moratorium that he has protected our the moratorium and we reached out to the Attorney General's office to share his story and to stop this landlord and his bad behavior, but this is another reason why it is so important to have these tenant protections.",92,,
399,0.97,3283.146,3290.253,It is to make an even playing field.,92,,
400,0.97,3290.253,3295.458,Landlords say that tenants need them so much but actually the tenant and the landlord need each other.,92,,
401,0.97,3295.458,3305.135,"And if it is a business, my hope is that every landlord who hears this is that they would pick people over profit.",92,,
402,0.97,3305.135,3319.149,"Come June 30th, the moratorium ends and last week we went to the capital to urge the governor of the state of Washington to pass and to extend the Eviction moratorium.",92,,
403,0.97,3319.149,3331.094,"If he does not extended, there are a lot of people right now as we speak, landlords are ready to take them to court and to Evict them.",92,,
404,0.97,3331.094,3338.635,"We are asking and I also put in ask out to the Mayor, Mayor Durkan, to extend the moratorium also in the city of Seattle.",92,,
405,0.97,3338.635,3344.607,Two extended past June 30th.,92,,
406,0.97,3344.607,3371.134,"If you don't extend this moratorium, you will be contributing to many, many families and individuals who will probably be on the streets and we don't want that under your leadership or under your hat so thank you Councilmember Braless for Council bill 120057 and thank you Councilmember Sawant and Councilmember Lewis for supporting this important legislation that we want to see.",92,,
407,0.97,3371.134,3372.602,Thank you very much and have a good day.,92,,
408,0.97,3372.602,3382.145,Thank you and please stay if you are able to if Councilmembers have any comments or questions for the panel.,93,,
409,0.97,3382.145,3382.378,Yes.,94,,
410,0.97,3382.378,3387.217,Thank you.,94,,
411,0.97,3387.217,3393.323,Next we have Jake laundry who has to leave by 3:20 as my understanding so welcome up and start by introducing yourself and go ahead.,95,,
412,0.97,3393.323,3397.994,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",96,,
413,0.97,3397.994,3417.18,My name is Jake laundry and I'm in a Seattle-based musician and a Renter in district six and rank-and-file labor and Union activist in the drivers Union with the teamsters and the Stagehands Union.,96,,
414,0.97,3417.18,3424.954,Because I feel like it's relevant to mention I also have a tiny side hustle property managing the Seattle home I grew up in from my mom as she rents it out while she lives with her mom down in California.,96,,
415,0.97,3424.954,3448.611,So basically I am a gig worker in the fullest sense of the word and speaking today in a personal capacity to share my story of why I support closing the just cause loophole . I can say with confidence after I spoke to her yesterday that even as a private landlord who is had multiple tenants over the year my mom adds her voice in support of closing this just cause loophole.,96,,
416,0.97,3448.611,3468.398,I hope by sharing more about myself we can help build on the momentum of our grassroots movements collective action who shared a lot of powerful testimony today in support of winning these Renters rights.,96,,
417,0.97,3471.401,3475.939,"I have lived here in Seattle for 11 years since I was 17, but like everyone else here it is been extremely challenging to find a place in Seattle that is affordable, especially during the pandemic.",96,,
418,0.97,3475.939,3481.211,I have moved 11 times in the last 11 years and often due to being priced out of the living situation I was in.,96,,
419,0.97,3481.211,3503.099,"After challenging year of being on and off unemployment, I will be looking for new work come June 30th when the Eviction moratorium ends and my term lease is up around that time too, and because you might be curious, we have already asked and my mom Randall price is totally out of reach for me and my partner at the moment.",96,,
420,0.97,3503.099,3547.076,"Úbut my partner and I have been saving up for years to get our puppy, Mo, who is been a Ray of sunshine during this tough year but our dog now adds a new challenge to finding housing accommodations and we are renting out and lucky to run out of place now with the yard for the first time and while I feel more confident in my current landlord than most I have had in the past that they won't exploit this just cause loophole and not renew my term lease, the urgent pressure for me of finding work this summer and keeping our friend about exciting renting out their basement and nice yard to us and our puppy at an affordable rate loom large for me and my partner and we are anxious and subconscious.",96,,
421,0.97,3547.076,3566.93,So closing the loophole would mean we'd have the extra layer of housing stability we need right now . I am extremely privileged I have been able to keep up on rent payments as they house the through my moving around but some of my friends haven't been able to pay rent and have been forced into homelessness through Eviction.,96,,
422,0.97,3566.93,3579.208,I have personally seen the reality and devastation of homelessness on the larger scale in my organizing with housing Kent city collective at the University of Washington.,96,,
423,0.97,3579.208,3618.348,I feel strongly that our legislators have a moral duty to protect the human rights of our community's most honorable and I see that Councilmember Sawant and Morales have proposed different bills to close the just cause loophole and I applaud Councilmembers Lewis and Sawant for Cosponsoring the morale a spell I want to join the chorus of the other Renters who support the unified legislative approach and hope all the other Councilmembers on the committee will merge the two bills so we get the strongest possible protections for Renters.,96,,
424,0.97,3618.348,3667.296,"We know that Renters rights, history will tell us it takes a mass community movement to create the strongest possible Renters protections which is why support in particular the legislation that Councilmember Sawant has introduced on behalf of our Renters rights movement requiring landlords provide 180 days of notice before imposing any rent increases which is affecting me in the past and having that amount of time to figure out how I will get a gig to make the rent increase could have helped me in the past and also extending relocation assistance to people who are economically evicted by rented I mentioned as I had been in the past.",96,,
425,0.97,3667.296,3677.14,Banning the latest form of legalized discrimination by barring landlords from using credit checks and rental applications which we know is highly problematic in a racist approach.,96,,
426,0.97,3677.14,3687.05,"For hammering onerous, undemocratic abusive lease terms, allowing rental history screenings to be transferable from one application to the next.",96,,
427,0.97,3687.05,3718.648,"Protecting Renters from default Evictions, canceling rents, mortgages and utility payments for people who have lost income due to Covid, and building our movement to fight and win for residential rent control and also fighting for struggling small businesses by winning commercial rent control . I know it won't be easy for us to win all of these, but as a Renter, Union member and activist and committed to uniting with others to fight for these rights which we need and deserve.",96,,
428,0.97,3718.648,3723.152,Thanks for carry my comments today.,96,,
429,0.97,3723.152,3723.619,"Think you, Jake.",97,,
430,0.97,3723.619,3725.455,I know you have to leave for work but stay as long as you are able to.,97,,

432,0.97,3735.898,3754.083,"It's not surprising at all, and I don't think you are in any way the only one in the situation but still stunning to see a working people like yourself and your story about having had to move 11 times in 11 years because of rent increases, it is really just shows how badly we need rent control in our city and all the other Renters rights you mentioned it.",97,,
433,0.97,3754.083,3770.299,"Next I would like to welcome a person coming up I Starbucks shift and we are grateful to you, Star, for joining us and please introduce yourself for the record and go ahead.",97,,

435,0.97,3774.537,3774.804,Hello.,98,,
436,0.97,3774.804,3787.517,"My name is Starr and I'm here as a Barista in Seattle calling on Councilmembers to stand with Renters, stand with the working class, Lgbtq and Trans community and eliminate the just cause loophole.",98,,
437,0.97,3787.517,3798.828,Past rent control now without loopholes that put forward by Councilmember Sawant in the movement.,98,,
438,0.97,3798.828,3807.67,Is a Barista in the city I struggled for months to find an affordable apartment and now the apartment I moved into is less affordable each time I renew my lease because they raise the rent every year.,98,,
439,0.97,3807.67,3821.918,I am afraid each time my lease is up they will refuse to renew my lease essentially putting me on the street . I would not be able to afford moving costs if this were to happen.,98,,
440,0.97,3821.918,3824.086,I cannot afford to move because of rent increase dramatically since I moved here seven years ago.,98,,
441,0.97,3824.086,3828.658,I have no credit so I can't get approved for an apartment and need a Cosigner even though unfortunate to have a good renting history.,98,,
442,0.97,3828.658,3834.864,I know if an emergency were to happen or if I was evicted due to the just cause loophole I could easily end up homeless.,98,,
443,0.97,3834.864,3841.704,As a Trans person that could mean death.,98,,
444,0.97,3841.704,3859.822,"Even in Seattle and other progressive urban areas, Lgbtq people are discriminated against and the just cause loophole is one easy way that landlords can discriminate against Trans people legally making it so much harder to find housing.",98,,
445,0.97,3859.822,3865.494,Trans people face discrimination in the workplace and a more than three times more likely to live in poverty and face extra life-threatening challenges when they are homeless.,98,,
446,0.97,3865.494,3871.701,I know that corporate landlords and manage my apartment building want to increase the rent Exponentially.,98,,
447,0.97,3871.701,3874.47,All around Seattle I see very expensive looking apartments being built that I know many people cannot afford to live in.,98,,
448,0.97,3874.47,3884.947,Many of my friends have moved out of Seattle because of the Unaffordable Nissen I'm afraid I will as well.,98,,
449,0.97,3884.947,3895.625,After saving up for years to move and having no extra money it was very hard to pay all the fees and take just to look at an apartment and apply.,98,,
450,0.97,3895.625,3897.26,I could no longer afford to look at apartment so I was forced to choose.,98,,
451,0.97,3897.26,3899.161,Now the corporate landlords at my apartment are slow to fix repairs if they do at all.,98,,
452,0.97,3899.161,3910.072,They are trying to push up my neighbors who moved here for over a decade by over monitoring them because they can increase the rent anymore.,98,,
453,0.97,3910.072,3924.72,Myself and many others can afford to live on her own and that is put many people in unhealthy and unsafe situations . protecting Renters is an imperative part of decreasing homelessness and before the Covid-19 pandemic many small businesses were struggling with rising rents in the protections.,98,,
454,0.97,3924.72,3929.158,Many places I like to go have been forced out of business.,98,,
455,0.97,3929.158,3933.195,"If you would like to have a person serve you coffee, workers need homes and places to work.",98,,
456,0.97,3933.195,3938.334,Struggling small businesses are Renters and they knew protections too.,98,,
457,0.97,3938.334,3951.747,"If you love your local businesses, show them by supporting Renters rights struggles including supporting commercial rent control.",98,,
458,0.97,3951.747,3952.682,As Councilmember Sawant has called for.,98,,
459,0.97,3952.682,3955.484,We can't rely on the establishment to protect our rights and up to us workers to show them that we will not be phased out.,98,,
460,0.97,3955.484,3956.919,We need to work together to protect ourselves and neighbors.,98,,
461,0.97,3956.919,3969.532,Last week I was proud to be among 40 community members who held a press conference with Councilmember Sawant calling for residential and commercial rent control with no loopholes.,98,,
462,0.97,3969.532,3975.671,180 did Vance notice for rent increases and relocation assistance when landlords force us out due to rent increases.,98,,
463,0.97,3975.671,3985.314,We need a fighting movement to win the measures just as we need a fighting movement to close the just cause loophole so landlords can kick us off for no reasons at all.,98,,
464,0.97,3985.314,3989.385,Renters are desperate but getting organized and fighting back and demanding the city council take action now.,98,,
465,0.97,3989.385,3993.522,Thank you.,98,,
466,0.97,3993.522,4024.587,"Thank you, Star, and especially for not only speaking as one of the many Baristas and service sector workers who are getting pressure from the city but also as a Trans community member and highlighted the disproportionate needs of the Lgbtq community and we appreciate that her nephew can stay, I know you had a very long day already, but next I'd like to welcome Colin Donovan from Lgbtq Allyship rental committee.",99,,

474,0.97,4082.611,4125.855,"I definitely agree with the Critiques of the corporate landlords situation, but I'm here also to dispel the notion that mom and pop landlords have been a wholly benevolent force during that and to highlight the needs to prevent vulnerable and disabled, query, trends and we need stable housing going into the future as we deal globally with the public health crisis in the emerging and continuing threats of climate change.",100,,
475,0.97,4125.855,4126.522,"To begin with, some background.",100,,
476,0.97,4126.522,4130.059,"I am an independent contractor with a background in community organizing, disability law and accommodation and higher education communications and political economy.",100,,
477,0.97,4130.059,4142.605,I hold a bachelors of arts from the Evergreen State College where I graduated in 2007.,100,,
478,0.97,4142.605,4145.307,For my entire adult life I have been surviving on a month to month basis like the majority of working and poor people do.,100,,
479,0.97,4145.307,4146.775,Prior to Covid I had never been late on rent before.,100,,
480,0.97,4146.775,4154.416,And at the time Covid began I was living in a two-bedroom apartment which is 1850 a month and splitting the rent with a long-term roommate.,100,,
481,0.97,4154.416,4168.964,"When the pandemic struck in Lockdown was enforced in March 2020, my former roommate for three years was forced to move out of state after they lost their food service job due to the initial Covid restrictions.",100,,
482,0.97,4168.964,4198.26,"This made me unable to cover the rent on my two bedroom unit and simultaneously the West Seattle bridge when out which depressed the number of people moving in the area and travel was restricted which impacted the Airbnb Union in the downstairs unit and I live in a Fourplex, and also a long-term elderly disabled tenant also downstairs died suddenly.",100,,
483,0.97,4198.26,4204.867,That Confluence of factors impacted my ability to find a roommate which I attempted to do as soon as I found out my roommate would be leaving due to the Covid impact.,100,,
484,0.97,4204.867,4223.552,I was unable to do so by last August and my current landlord then had a mental health crisis in my opinion after she was impacted negatively.,100,,
485,0.97,4223.552,4231.727,She is a First-Time landlord and this is are single property and she lives across the street with her husband and is an employee of Seattle public schools working in special education.,100,,
486,0.97,4231.727,4258.52,Prior to the pandemic she and I had what I believed was a very good relationship and had talked extensively about our respective identities and careers as people with disabilities working in education and the way social justice impacts disabled life choices.,100,,
487,0.97,4258.52,4277.539,"When I was unable to pay the rent for August 2020 in its entirety, I was in communication with her verbally and over text message about my heightened risk of Covid as a disabled person and thanked her for understanding my situation as an activist and express my wish to work with her to ensure she was able to get her money.",100,,
488,0.97,4278.607,4291.453,"I simultaneously contacted several area organizations, mutual aid groups and try to Fundraise and attempting to find a new roommate and repeatedly asked my landlord work with me during the pandemic and this was while the moratorium was still in place.",100,,
489,0.97,4291.453,4294.423,At midnight on August 16th I exited my apartment to dispose of trash by the rear entrance Úwhich I wasn't regularly using at the time.,100,,
490,0.97,4294.423,4309.371,"Upon opening the door, a single sheet of paper fell to the ground and there had been no Email, call or text from my landlord as had been our regular pattern up to that point with no problems.",100,,
491,0.97,4309.371,4325.688,The NOTE dated August 15th and left propped Unfasten to my back door which is an illegal Eviction threat telling me if I didn't pay in full by August 31st I would be forcibly removed from the apartment.,100,,
492,0.97,4325.688,4342.104,I was stunned and terrified since I had spoken with my landlord only a few days prior and she seemed open to working with me on a payment plan . She had given no indication that this threat was imminent.,100,,
493,0.97,4342.104,4348.143,As someone who works professionally for the city as a special education teacher for Seattle public schools I expected her to be aware of your obligations regarding housing and the pandemic as well as the content of my lease which was misrepresented in the threat.,100,,
494,0.97,4348.143,4354.016,"Let me be clear to the Council that I am a Transgender, Bopbopqueer disabled professional and I know my rights legally.",100,,
495,0.97,4354.016,4367.262,"My landlord and her husband showed up pattern of hostility over several months which included verbal intimidation from my landlord's husband, Harassment of the other building tenants and refusal to follow the law.",100,,
496,0.97,4367.262,4377.206,My landlord did this as a result of the economic devastation of Covid and and a Confluence of factors beyond each of us as individuals.,100,,
497,0.97,4377.206,4393.922,"In the course of my own navigation of these housing impacts I have met several other tenants, trends and disabled folks who were enduring similar hardships, systemic protections are needed.",100,,
498,0.97,4393.922,4395.224,We need to protect those with the least access to safety.,100,,
499,0.97,4395.224,4407.169,I ended up being able to file a report with the Washington State Attorney General after receiving help from the Washington state tenants Union.,100,,
500,0.97,4407.169,4420.816,"Because the laws existed and were enforced, I was reliant on those systemic Eviction protections and since that was in place it effectively De- escalated the Harassment.",100,,
501,0.97,4420.816,4426.155,I was able to secure payment for August 2020 through December 2020 in full through the King County Eviction protection and rental assistance program which needs to be Robustly funded.,100,,
502,0.97,4426.155,4431.16,"However, my economic devastation has not ended.",100,,
503,0.97,4431.16,4444.373,I now owe back rent from January through the present for my entire unit as I have not felt comfortable recording a new roommate into this ongoing Harassment history and unstable situation.,100,,
504,0.97,4444.373,4451.246,My landlord has since fill the vacancies in the building and I have a good relationship with my new neighbors.,100,,
505,0.97,4451.246,4459.955,"We've had Airbnb traffic on my landlord has recovered significantly financially while my situation remains one of stress, debt, overwhelm, job searching, and legal navigation.",100,,
506,0.97,4459.955,4477.673,I currently owe a total of 9250 and plan to apply for all rental assistance to alleviate the debt and encourage my landlord repeatedly to investigate resources available to her as a landlord.,100,,
507,0.97,4477.673,4482.644,In addition I'm actively searching for stable employment in this environment as I have been for months.,100,,
508,0.97,4482.644,4494.756,I continue to work with area housing organizations including the Lgbtq ally ship Renters rights committee I represent today as well as the tenancy of Washington State to navigate my situation.,100,,
509,0.97,4494.756,4504.5,Those organizations and others like them need to be listened to and facing this amount of insecurity in the midst of a global pandemic is not a joke.,100,,
510,0.97,4504.5,4521.016,My life is literally on the line and so are those of others and we must protect the most honorable in this ongoing health crisis with the cumulative economic effects of decades of Trickle-Down social poverty have hit the hardest.,100,,
511,0.97,4521.016,4528.59,We have a moral obligation to act to protect vulnerable tenants in every possible way now.,100,,
512,0.97,4528.59,4549.144,I am unable to secure new housing to get out of the situation without continued stability and to that end it is essential that we close these fixed loopholes and extend just cause protections fully across the state with no loopholes control is needed.,100,,
513,0.97,4549.144,4550.712,We must ensure that children remain housed during the school year.,100,,
514,0.97,4550.712,4558.086,My landlord is an educator and perhaps if she had mortgage relief as an educator this would not have happened to us.,100,,
515,0.97,4558.086,4594.656,"We need Covid financial hardship as an Eviction defense . Although I'm on month to month lease I have no doubt that due to my landlord's past instability they would use any loophole they can find to be able to Evict me out of the situation and get a fresh start with a different class of tenant . is a disabled Bopbopqueer Trans individual, I have experienced extensive housing discrimination from so-called Mom-And-Pop landlords who are unaware of the law or recalcitrant when engaged with that legal reality.",100,,
516,0.97,4594.656,4603.231,"I'm here today as an activist and engaged in citizen and someone who is disabled, trends and Bopbopqueer lived in the area since 1995.",100,,

518,0.97,4606.601,4610.973,Poverty is not an individual moral failing.,100,,
519,0.97,4610.973,4616.612,It is in fact are required and forced feature of the capitalist system and wealth inequality today.,100,,

525,0.97,4644.339,4669.531,I really appreciate you talking about how Renters and landlords are different sizes and all tenants need full protection and a full tenants bill of rights regardless of the size of the landlord . It is a really big problem that landlords are holding Renters responsible for the rent of the roommates when the roommate moves out.,101,,
526,0.97,4669.531,4686.248,We absolutely need to have legislation that stops landlords from putting that burdens on Renters I appreciate you and hope you are able to stay and I'm sure Councilmembers will have comments and questions.,101,,

529,0.97,4692.02,4692.421,All right.,102,,
530,0.97,4692.421,4692.854,You can hear me?,102,,
531,0.97,4692.854,4697.959,Yes.,103,,
532,0.97,4697.959,4706.735,"Hi, my name is Colton Ikenyon and I am a taxpaying citizen and live in South Lake Union.",104,,
533,0.97,4706.735,4713.241,I recently have still not been able to get any financial help since January for my rent and it is $1500 a month including utilities.,104,,
534,0.97,4713.241,4728.857,"And right now, especially during all of this I am living in and out of the hospital.",104,,
535,0.97,4728.857,4752.981,"So I want to put a little bit of the attention on understanding how my situation, especially with work due to the phases, I'm no longer allowed back in my bar yet and completely out of work and there is rent every single month that is piling up on my back rent.",104,,
536,0.97,4752.981,4770.265,"In my landlord has said they will not bring me my lease and with this loophole, they could really comment me and get me out of here, and I just have been going through so much emotional and physical strain from this.",104,,
537,0.97,4770.265,4774.236,But just mentally not knowing if I'm going to have a place to live.,104,,
538,0.97,4774.236,4787.549,"We need to extend the moratorium because not only for the simple fact I'm not even back at work, but most Seattle citizens that are in my industry, they are not back and able to come to work.",104,,
539,0.97,4787.549,4814.509,"I also just wanted to touch on, I feel like as a kid who grew up in a household and worked a lot with the state, I couldn't even imagine what would happen if I had to go through Covid as a kid and had to be stuck at the house, let alone having my parents worry that we would not have a roof for me to live because as a kid you never even think about bills.",104,,
540,0.97,4814.509,4821.883,You just think about your next Cheerios and it's way different.,104,,
541,0.97,4821.883,4823.852,"On top of that, I feel like we need to get more housing programs.",104,,
542,0.97,4823.852,4842.938,"I have been working the past three months now trying to figure out a different situation due to the fact that I am saving over $100 a week--I'm sorry, not a week but a month to try to initiate something so I can move and find a new deposit as well as down payment for a place.",104,,
543,0.97,4842.938,4870.165,"I have been working with community groups that used to be capital housing as well as bellwether housing and they have no properties right now available outside of just a couple of studios and the fight for those, no one has even called me back because everyone during the pandemic has tried to get a hold of the housing programs that we do have so that way they don't lose a roof over their head.",104,,
544,0.97,4870.165,4892.187,So I really feel like we need to not only take care of some of the financial roles but we need to make sure that we are going to still have a program out there that would be able to accept us so we can have a roof over our heads.,104,,
545,0.97,4892.187,4903.198,I think we need to add more programs and we definitely need to add more properties to the list because we are now at unemployment all time high in Seattle and Capitol Hill.,104,,
546,0.97,4903.198,4915.877,"I'm part of the gay community as well and as far as it has gone for a lot of my friends businesses, they are having to close their properties and will never ever open up ever again so we're losing a lot of history in that sense.",104,,
547,0.97,4915.877,4950.578,"I really just need to get a plan to be able to eliminate this loophole and be able to help put these on tenants heads and I know the landlords that are not corporate and how it affects their lives as well, but you have to understand how the tenants feel, and I feel like there is a problem with that and we need to make sure that we also has some funds coming in delegated to help people like myself get back with our background.",104,,
548,0.97,4950.578,4959.888,I don't want to claim bankruptcy at the age of 26 and it is looking more and more bleak as I try to gain hope for a change.,104,,
549,0.97,4959.888,4969.431,I really think we need to not only listen to all of the people that spoke today but also need to protect everyone of them and myself.,104,,
550,0.97,4969.431,4974.836,Thank you.,104,,
551,0.97,4974.836,4975.67,"Thank you so much, Colton.",105,,

561,0.97,5008.47,5009.437,I'm sorry.,108,,
562,0.97,5009.437,5016.177,There we go.,108,,
563,0.97,5016.177,5027.288,"My name is Sean Butterfield and I am a rank-and-file member of Seiu 775 speaking in my capacity and a Caregiver for my disabled partner, Terry, and we live together in a rented apartment on Capitol Hill.",108,,
564,0.97,5027.288,5043.805,I previously gave a similar testimony in late April . at the previous hearing on just cause Eviction legislation I want to emphasize the front something I didn't adequately address at that time.,108,,
565,0.97,5043.805,5054.983,Making substantial and effective change usually is not about making a compelling argument for having the best technical solution to the problems that we face.,108,,
566,0.97,5054.983,5055.95,That's how it is supposed to work.,108,,
567,0.97,5055.95,5061.022,"It is how we are educated and constantly reassured that it works, but it is plain to see that's not how it actually works.",108,,
568,0.97,5061.022,5070.632,And we are told to the country and are meant to distract and Placate us.,108,,
569,0.97,5070.632,5072.4,Most people convinced by the illusory story and I was for most of my life too.,108,,
570,0.97,5072.4,5099.961,"I want to personally thank you, Councilmember Sawant to help take me from this delusion even if it's meant to be more uncomfortable discouraging Rheology but worth putting out for those listening that the reason why the Technocratic approach to legislation doesn't work the way we are told it was.",108,,
571,0.97,5099.961,5101.529,A problem simply aren't problems for the powerful people in society.,108,,
572,0.97,5101.529,5108.77,Very often those people are powerful and wealthy because they are in a position to extract wealth from and Afflict the clarity upon the people for whom that is a problem.,108,,
573,0.97,5108.77,5115.71,So we want to tell the counselor problems and the solutions we would like to see and usually they ignore it because we don't have any powers as individuals.,108,,
574,0.97,5115.71,5124.819,I can't afford to bankroll candidates like Ryan and Alex Pederson.,108,,
575,0.97,5124.819,5130.792,Unlike the highly Lauded and powerful business interests who frequently and Disingenuously complain that their input is not heard by this Council.,108,,
576,0.97,5130.792,5176.504,"So the only way we have as workers, Caregivers like myself, to solve our political problems is by building a cohesive movement in opposition to the powerful people who exploit us and that's why am here talking to you and Councilmember Sawant is the only one who is actually effective as evidence by victories and a fight by the $15 an hour minimum wage, income tax and mentor protections, it has been met with widespread disdain among those who still claim the comfortable lie of competent Technocratic government as well as those who benefit from it.",108,,
577,0.97,5176.504,5197.559,"I want to make it exceptionally clear up front to everyone Listeningthat building that movement is the only way we're going to win the changes that will actually Ameliorate the problems we have materially in our lives, when those solutions might threaten the political and economic of corporate landlords and other business interests.",108,,
578,0.97,5197.559,5217.178,All that set up front I will just carry on with my comments one last time because I hope they continue to add something to this hearing.,108,,
579,0.97,5222.717,5227.055,What to speak specifically from the perspective of people with disabilities about the loophole under discussion today allowing landlords to in your tendency for any reason at the conclusion of your lease.,108,,
580,0.97,5227.055,5229.591,Even if they just turn around and run it to someone else after you move out.,108,,
581,0.97,5229.591,5233.828,"My situation, my partner Terry has a progressive disability and can't stand or transfer from her better wheelchair without assistance.",108,,
582,0.97,5233.828,5253.615,It used to mean a balance in health but for the past few years at MENA Caregiver lifting her body weight and moving her and after years of effort on my part with Dhs installed the lift in our apartment and finally granted four years ago.,108,,
583,0.97,5253.615,5255.817,This meant we can hire any Caregiver not limiting us to those with the strength to lift her.,108,,
584,0.97,5255.817,5268.83,"Like most of us, she can't get lighter as she gets older and crucially it is meant we can move her safely without the added risk of injury of injuring her or her ourselves.",108,,
585,0.97,5268.83,5279.307,As these years have gone by we have become more and more reliant on the lift as her disability has progressed and we have realized just how reliant we are on our continued tenancy in this apartment.,108,,
586,0.97,5279.307,5285.346,Because it is built into the ceiling of this apartment.,108,,
587,0.97,5285.346,5305.9,"And how vulnerable we are to Eviction, each of the past 10 years our lease has been renewed, but each year brings up tolerable fear we will be forced to move and go without this vital piece of Assistive technology.",108,,
588,0.97,5305.9,5323.484,Potentially for years until the Department of social and health services Reinstalls it in a new apartment from which we could just as easily be a bit at the conclusion of a six or 12 month lease.,108,,
589,0.97,5323.484,5324.686,And I want to be clear it's not just us.,108,,
590,0.97,5324.686,5327.722,Anyone who uses a wheelchair or require specific amenities due to disability has an incredibly difficult time finding and keeping housing.,108,,
591,0.97,5327.722,5328.323,Úbe on the deficit of A.D.A.,108,,
592,0.97,5328.323,5336.197,Compliant apartments in Seattle landlords to their level best to remove tenants for a bevy of reasons and often because of the accommodations based on having to require or because Wheelchairs can scuff paints in unit's.,108,,
593,0.97,5336.197,5359.12,Charities previous landlord refused to renew her lease because of this minor wear and tear but of course they never needed to defend that flimsy pretax in court at the time and would instill today because one landlords to decide to Evict disabled tenants they do so using loopholes like the term lease Eviction loophole that we are talking about.,108,,
594,0.97,5359.12,5373.134,This Eviction is disruptive to all Renters and those with disabilities who won't find new housing in a city with few accessible units.,108,,
595,0.97,5373.134,5395.356,"People with disabilities rely on it takes months or years to build the kind of rapport with neighbors to ask neighbors to help them pull up their pants, retrieve objects or get back in the wheelchair after an emergency.",108,,
596,0.97,5395.356,5398.826,These types of relationships are the fabric of community.,108,,
597,0.97,5398.826,5400.661,Every Eviction tears a gaping hole in the fabric.,108,,
598,0.97,5400.661,5408.336,Renters like us desperately need the protections from this abuse of the balance of power between tenants and landlords.,108,,
599,0.97,5408.336,5418.379,The legislation before this committee advanced by Councilmember Sawant would give us a semblance of security.,108,,
600,0.97,5418.379,5431.993,"Before the expiration of the moratorium, and the avalanche that would sure to fall over.",108,,
601,0.97,5431.993,5432.994,Thank you for your time.,108,,
602,0.97,5432.994,5433.795,"Thank you, Sean.",109,,
603,0.97,5433.795,5451.712,"Thank you for sharing, once again, the experience that you and charity has had as a disabled community member and a Caregiver . to the Speaker, our last Speaker is Renee Gordon.",109,,
604,0.97,5451.712,5453.314,Go ahead and introduce yourself for the record.,109,,
605,0.97,5453.314,5459.086,"Also, I would just say it is important that everybody is sharing their story, but let's refrain from making any remarks about Council members or anyone else.",109,,
606,0.97,5459.086,5461.756,"We do, as we all have said, want to build a unified community.",109,,
607,0.97,5461.756,5462.023,Go ahead.,109,,
608,0.97,5462.023,5469.797,"Good afternoon, Council members.",110,,
609,0.97,5469.797,5471.899,I just want to make sure you have been listening.,110,,
610,0.97,5471.899,5473.601,"I have, and my heart is really breaking.",110,,
611,0.97,5473.601,5477.038,That's why we have to close the loophole for the just cause ordinance.,110,,
612,0.97,5477.038,5478.039,We have to do it now.,110,,
613,0.97,5478.039,5489.083,The written moratorium expires on June 30th.,110,,
614,0.97,5492.487,5494.856,There are protections in place for residents on a Month-To- month lease.,110,,
615,0.97,5494.856,5498.125,The landlord must show a reason and go to court to convict on a month-to-month lease.,110,,
616,0.97,5498.125,5503.865,There are 16 reasons that are allowed that have stopped many Evictions over the years.,110,,
617,0.97,5503.865,5505.766,"Term leases on the other hand, have no protections.",110,,
618,0.97,5505.766,5511.339,"So if you are on a 6 to 12 month lease, when your lease is up, your landlord can't Evict you with no cause at all.",110,,
619,0.97,5511.339,5512.54,This practice must be terminated.,110,,
620,0.97,5512.54,5513.975,Renters on term leases deserve full rights.,110,,
621,0.97,5513.975,5522.183,"They deserve just cause protections, too.",110,,
622,0.97,5522.183,5524.452,We are also fighting to stop Evictions during the school year.,110,,
623,0.97,5524.452,5525.286,It is a No-Brainer.,110,,
624,0.97,5525.286,5528.756,Children need a home to do their homework.,110,,
625,0.97,5528.756,5529.991,This is going to take organizing.,110,,
626,0.97,5529.991,5532.159,"And we are going to have to do it, now.",110,,
627,0.97,5532.159,5535.763,The moratorium will be lifted again on June 30th.,110,,
628,0.97,5535.763,5539.267,"When that happens, there will be a flood of Evictions.",110,,
629,0.97,5539.267,5549.076,This is going to cause more people to become homeless and add more people to the already huge homeless crisis that is currently going on in Seattle.,110,,
630,0.97,5549.076,5555.483,It's going to take us to get organized and build a big movement to win.,110,,
631,0.97,5555.483,5557.118,I know that we can do it.,110,,
632,0.97,5557.118,5561.822,"Because two years ago, I was asleep.",110,,
633,0.97,5561.822,5563.224,I heard a knock on the door.,110,,
634,0.97,5563.224,5565.927,I put my ear to the window to see what was going on.,110,,
635,0.97,5565.927,5569.43,Jonathan and Sasha came to our building to tell us what was happening.,110,,
636,0.97,5569.43,5588.549,"It turned out the real estate that purchased our building, when my Aunt has lived there for 30 years, it is her home, they had planned on kicking her out.",110,,
637,0.97,5588.549,5589.55,She is 90 years old.,110,,
638,0.97,5589.55,5594.956,"They wanted to kick her out and our community of seniors, immigrants, people of color, families with children, and tear it down and build expensive apartments.",110,,
639,0.97,5594.956,5595.923,So we got organized.,110,,
640,0.97,5595.923,5596.591,We held press conferences.,110,,
641,0.97,5596.591,5607.134,We obtained community support.,110,,
642,0.97,5607.435,5612.273,"We got unions, faith communities, a petition signed by hundreds of people, and now we have several extra years to stay at our place.",110,,
643,0.97,5612.273,5614.842,We have $5000 for any resident who moves out for relocation assistance.,110,,
644,0.97,5614.842,5625.786,"Now, we need to do this, but we need to do it again on a bigger scale.",110,,
645,0.97,5625.786,5628.089,We have to win the just cause protections and rent control.,110,,
646,0.97,5628.089,5630.691,"And we need more affordable housing, too, as we will hear, today.",110,,
647,0.97,5630.691,5633.227,The corporate landlords are going to fight us every step of the way.,110,,
648,0.97,5633.227,5634.195,But we will get organized.,110,,
649,0.97,5634.195,5636.097,We will build and move it to win.,110,,
650,0.97,5636.097,5636.797,I believe we can win.,110,,
651,0.97,5636.797,5638.265,We must win.,110,,
652,0.97,5638.265,5645.406,It is the right thing to do.,110,,
653,0.97,5645.406,5648.976,"Our great leader Martin Luther King said, the time is always right to do what is right.",110,,
654,0.97,5648.976,5654.115,So let's do it.,110,,
655,0.97,5654.115,5654.515,Thank you.,110,,
656,0.97,5654.515,5673.367,"Thank you, Rene, and for reminding us how you and your fellow tenants had a concrete victory against a corporate developer landlord who was trying to basically find a way to Evict so many of our elderly and people of color neighbors from the heart of the central district.",111,,
657,0.97,5673.367,5677.938,I really appreciate everybody who came from the community and the Renters rights to speak.,111,,
658,0.97,5677.938,5682.91,"Oh's of you who can stay, please stay.",111,,
659,0.97,5682.91,5684.745,I know we are going to have comments.,111,,
660,0.97,5684.745,5686.447,I wanted to open it up to committee members.,111,,
661,0.97,5686.447,5689.05,These raise your hand.,111,,
662,0.97,5689.05,5691.952,"I will be watching on the resume for any hands, Dr.",111,,
663,0.97,5691.952,5697.692,"Mireles, go ahead.",111,,
664,0.97,5697.692,5700.528,I want to thank the panelists for being here.,112,,
665,0.97,5700.528,5709.87,I think it is important for us to hear their stories and to hear how people are directly impacted by the challenges that exist in the current law.,112,,
666,0.97,5709.87,5719.78,I do also want to thank the folks we invited who helped us craft the Council bill we are about to talk about.,112,,
667,0.97,5719.78,5724.085,"Violet, Colton, Colin, who else did we have on staff?",112,,
668,0.97,5724.085,5724.385,I forgot.,112,,
669,0.97,5724.385,5729.857,"Kate, thank you so much.",112,,
670,0.97,5729.857,5742.57,"Thank you for being here and sharing, again, why this work is so important to you as individuals and the people you serve in your work capacities.",112,,
671,0.97,5742.57,5742.803,Thanks.,112,,
672,0.97,5742.803,5746.574,"Thank you, Councilman Mireles.",113,,
673,0.97,5746.574,5755.983,Do other Councilmembers have questions or comments for the panel?,113,,
674,0.97,5755.983,5763.39,I am not seeing any.,113,,
675,0.97,5763.39,5773.634,I will wait for a few seconds more just in case anyone is getting ready to say something or raise their hand.,113,,
676,0.97,5773.634,5778.139,I will just say one thing.,113,,
677,0.97,5778.139,5781.442,Maybe other members will raise their hand in the meantime.,113,,
678,0.97,5781.442,5790.017,"Yeah, I definitely what--would recommend what Councilmember Morales said.",113,,
679,0.97,5790.017,5804.431,It is extremely important to have actual Renters who are affected by the lack of Renters rights and the complete imbalance of power between tenants and landlords.,113,,
680,0.97,5804.431,5840.434,"I think some specific points, just to reiterate from Colin Donovan, I do appreciate you pointing out that it is a huge problem that landlords hold Renters and tenants responsible for the rent of other tenants, roommate tenants when the roommates moved out, and my staff and I will definitely be working with city Council to find out if there is a way to stop this without undermining the existing Renters rights to make sure that landlords don't put that burden on their tenants.",113,,
681,0.97,5840.434,5845.272,We would definitely love to be in touch with you.,113,,
682,0.97,5845.272,5855.316,"If people are watching this Committee, if you had this happen to you where you were legally liable for the rent of your roommates, please make sure to contact my office.",113,,
683,0.97,5855.316,5873.334,"We want to make sure we find a way out of this, and calling, am I right that you have been continuing to pay your portion of the rent, but that you have not been able to afford the rent of your former roommate, obviously?",113,,
684,0.97,5873.334,5877.338,Can you clarify?,113,,
685,0.97,5877.338,5882.109,I am currently behind on my rent total for myself and my roommates portion.,114,,
686,0.97,5882.109,5885.145,I did pay through the Eviction and rental assistance program.,114,,
687,0.97,5885.145,5894.421,I did pay the entirety of my half through December of 2020.,114,,
688,0.97,5894.421,5916.143,"But I have not been paying for this year simply because I am unemployed due to the pandemic, and I need to find a way out of this situation.",114,,
689,0.97,5916.143,5918.479,"You know, Ideally, I would be able to move another tenant in.",114,,
690,0.97,5918.479,5925.085,We could move forward from the team as we thought we had been previously.,114,,
691,0.97,5925.085,5941.502,"I understand my landlord has had a mental strain with this kind of thing, but yes, I'm currently in debt, myself, and for my former roommates portion because I have not been able to find a new roommate to move in to this unstable situation.",114,,
692,0.97,5941.502,5942.77,That is the update on that.,114,,
693,0.97,5942.77,5944.805,And I do need all the assistance I can get.,114,,
694,0.97,5944.805,5948.309,"I mean, I have never been late on my rents, ever, until August of 2020.",114,,
695,0.97,5948.309,5948.709,"So, Yeah.",114,,
696,0.97,5948.709,5951.812,"Right, thank you for mentioning that.",115,,
697,0.97,5951.812,5962.022,"I think there are a lot of Renters like yourself who have never been behind on their rent, once, but because of this crisis, they are now behind.",115,,
698,0.97,5962.022,5967.127,I think it also highlights how we need to fight to cancel Covid debt.,115,,
699,0.97,5967.127,5981.442,"Because short of that, there is no way that 100,000 mentors in our state are currently accumulating Renter dent--debt are going to be able to pay it back.",115,,
700,0.97,5981.442,5991.719,I think we are also echoed in what Colton said about how people have not been able to get back on their feet.,115,,
701,0.97,5991.719,5997.791,"Colton, did you say that your bartender job has not restarted yet?",115,,
702,0.97,5997.791,6005.199,"If that's the case, I also want to say, I completely agree with you we need to extend the Eviction moratorium.",115,,
703,0.97,6005.199,6010.137,"Yeah, I wanted to say a few things about that.",115,,
704,0.97,6010.137,6010.971,Can you clarify?,115,,
705,0.97,6010.971,6013.64,Are you not able to get your job back because it hasn't started yet?,115,,
706,0.97,6013.64,6014.441,"Yes, correct.",116,,
707,0.97,6014.441,6019.98,This is the problem that my business is having fault with.,116,,
708,0.97,6019.98,6023.016,We are only at 50% occupancy.,116,,
709,0.97,6023.016,6035.295,We are not allowed to do Karaoke because that is considered an event with bringing people.,116,,
710,0.97,6035.295,6036.697,They can do Karaoke at a table.,116,,
711,0.97,6036.697,6047.007,"Basically, the managers of the only people working because they are not even breaking even with their bills, let alone breaking even to hire somebody to come back to work.",116,,
712,0.97,6047.007,6049.51,I'm told I'm not going to be back until September.,116,,
713,0.97,6049.51,6057.718,"So all my other friends that are bartenders as well, they are not able to come back due to that same fact.",116,,
714,0.97,6057.718,6064.491,"Okay, thank you.",117,,
715,0.97,6064.491,6080.441,"Just on the Eviction moratorium, you made a very important point about the need to extend the Eviction moratorium because so many Renters need time to get back on their feet.",117,,
716,0.97,6080.441,6086.847,I don't know how many committee members know about the resolution in my office to urge the Mayor and governor to extend the Eviction moratorium to the end of the year.,117,,
717,0.97,6086.847,6107.301,"We upheld the bulk of that because at that time, about a month or two ago, it was because of the pressure from Renters organizing, signing petitions and so on, that the Mayor was forced to announce a new extension, also the state registration governor also announced that.",117,,
718,0.97,6107.301,6112.072,"We had held the vote, but it is due to come back on June 3RD.",117,,
719,0.97,6112.072,6125.152,"We will need tenants like all of you to help advocate to pass because in addition to all the laws we are talking about, we also need to extend the Eviction moratorium.",117,,
720,0.97,6125.152,6135.662,That's an urgency right now.,117,,
721,0.97,6140.534,6141.335,"Councilmember Mireles, go ahead.",117,,
722,0.97,6141.335,6143.37,"Yeah, we have 20 minutes left for this Committee.",118,,
723,0.97,6143.37,6147.508,"I would like to ask that we move to the discussion of the bill in question, if I could.",118,,
724,0.97,6147.508,6149.176,"Yes, we were about to go right now.",119,,
725,0.97,6149.176,6151.979,I was about to take one last look at any Council member questions.,119,,
726,0.97,6151.979,6166.827,"There aren't any, so we will move to the second and third agenda items, because they are both presentation from city council central staff walking us through a memo describing the two Council bills, the two draft bills for the just Eviction--just cause Eviction ordinance.",119,,
727,0.97,6166.827,6180.607,"You know, as committee members know, we prepared one other draft [Indiscernible] regardless of which bill is finally passed, the important thing is closing the loophole.",119,,
728,0.97,6180.607,6186.813,Could you come on and introduce yourself for the memo--I would like to invite Councilmember Morales to say a few words [Indiscernible] 1257.,119,,
729,0.97,6186.813,6191.718,"Thank you, I appreciate it.",120,,
730,0.97,6191.718,6206.233,"Yes, we have a bill today that proposes a simple but powerful fix to the just cause ordinance that will ensure tenants regardless of where they are in their lease or what kind of contract they have will be protected from the threat of No- fault No-Cost removal from their homes.",120,,
731,0.97,6206.233,6216.443,This will ensure that tenants are not unjustly pressured into mutual lease Terminations as well.,120,,
732,0.97,6216.443,6221.381,We know the Seattle Renters have been granted some form of just cause Eviction protection since the 80s.,120,,
733,0.97,6221.381,6230.991,Even this set of protections has left one Avenue open for tenants to be forced from their homes for no fault of their own.,120,,
734,0.97,6230.991,6233.894,That gap allows landlords to refuse a rental relationship without having to provide a reason.,120,,
735,0.97,6233.894,6240.467,This really doesn't align with the work we are trying to do as a city to protect Renters.,120,,
736,0.97,6240.467,6263.59,"This bill would close the gap once and for all by allowing landlords to offer a lease renewal like they do now, and offering tenants to go Month-To- month at the end of a fixed term lease by default . If it isn't offered, or if it doesn't meet the tenants standards.",120,,
737,0.97,6263.59,6267.327,So this legislation also explicitly opens just cause Eviction protection to tenants on any lease term or type.,120,,
738,0.97,6267.327,6286.413,"Lastly, it strengthens the bargaining power by allowing them to rescind a mutual lease termination in the case where they felt pressured into signing one or after we include some amendments, we will discuss later, even if one wasn't signed in the presence of an attorney or Caseworker or mediator.",120,,
739,0.97,6286.413,6313.573,"So as recovery nears, as protections are lifted, tenants deserved stability as we have heard very clearly, today, we know that they deserve to live their lives without the threat of losing their homes over situations that they can't control like something as colossal as the pandemic or something as simple as a landlord not liking them.",120,,
740,0.97,6313.573,6321.348,"So my office has been working alongside community organizers, advocates, and every day Renters in developing a tenant of rights, starting now, I closing a lease termination gap.",120,,
741,0.97,6321.348,6344.604,"I want people to know that the next piece of legislation for this Committee, the sound at home Eviction defense legislation that would protect any Renter who faces hardship during the pandemic from facing Eviction, so call in, hopefully, this can help address some of the challenges you are having.",120,,
742,0.97,6344.604,6353.413,"Allowing passage of the two bills, we will continue the work for the just cause Eviction ordinance, which I know Councilmember Sawant will do as well.",120,,
743,0.97,6353.413,6360.32,We will do more to protect Renters from unjust and hasty Evictions.,120,,
744,0.97,6360.32,6370.297,I want to thank everybody who has been here today to share their stories and the stay housed stay healthy coalition for working with my office on these policies.,120,,
745,0.97,6370.297,6372.132,None of this would be possible without your work.,120,,
746,0.97,6372.132,6381.408,I want to thank Council members Lewis and Sawant.,120,,
747,0.97,6381.408,6383.043,I'm proud of the work we have done.,120,,
748,0.97,6383.043,6386.713,"We have worked with law, central staff, and as DCI to bring the strongest bill possible.",120,,
749,0.97,6386.713,6393.92,"I hope that after discussion, my colleagues will agree that this is the bill for us to pass.",120,,
750,0.97,6393.92,6399.86,And I am happy to talk about the SDC I amendments once we get to that part of the conversation.,120,,
751,0.97,6399.86,6406.5,"Asha, go ahead with your introduction.",121,,
752,0.97,6406.5,6413.44,[Indiscernible] with Council central staff.,122,,
753,0.97,6413.44,6420.18,"I will lay out some general items about the current regulatory landscape and the Tenancies we are discussing, then dive into details.",122,,
754,0.97,6420.18,6443.303,"From a big picture perspective, there are three types of Tenancies that implicate just cause protections . The first is a month-to-month Tennessee, so any tenancy in which the tenant is paying on a monthly basis, their rent, and always accepting it, then there are fixed term rental agreements which is what is known as leases.",122,,
755,0.97,6443.303,6466.56,"At the end of the lease, the provision within the lease can either stay silent or say that the lease, itself, ends on the date--the end of the fixed term, or in the fixed term lease, it can specify that the lease, itself, will convert to a month-to-month lease.",122,,
756,0.97,6466.56,6482.342,"The sections that Seattle currently has as well as the legislation that was just passed, state house bill 1236, requires just cause for Month- To-Month Tenancies.",122,,
757,0.97,6482.342,6491.718,Both of those cover the Month- To-Month tenancy lease type.,122,,
758,0.97,6491.718,6502.529,"Excuse me, in terms of fixed term leases that convert automatically to month-to-month Tenancies, Eviction protections also required just cause to end those tendencies.",122,,
759,0.97,6502.529,6509.803,House bill 1236 does require Eviction based on just cause unless certain circumstances apply.,122,,
760,0.97,6509.803,6519.446,Either the additional rental term was between six and 12 months and the landlord has to give 60 days notice.,122,,
761,0.97,6519.446,6530.657,The issue that comes before and is commonly Referenced as the loophole is this class of rental agreements that do not convert into month-to-month agreements.,122,,
762,0.97,6530.657,6540.1,"Currently, under the Seattle just cause Eviction protections, just cause is not required to end that type of tenancy.",122,,
763,0.97,6540.1,6555.282,The state bill does require just cause except for certain circumstances in which the initial agreement is for 12 months or more or you have had multiple six months agreements at the beginning of the tenancy.,122,,
764,0.97,6555.282,6572.832,"The landlord gives a 60 day notice, or the tenancy has never been month-to-month except in the circumstance in which the tenant has entered a rental agreement between then, and the end of the moratorium.",122,,
765,0.97,6572.832,6597.424,"We are working with the city's attorney's office and as DCI to better understand the landscape that 1236 now creates for Seattle, more broadly in terms of just cause protections, and more specifically in the context of these bills, but I wanted to lay out what that would look like because we are in sort of a new regulatory landscape when it comes to just cause given the state protections.",122,,
766,0.97,6597.424,6614.474,"So, what the bills we are discussing today, 120057 and 56 report to do our addressing the circumstance for the classic rental agreements that do not automatically convert into a month-to-month rental agreement.",122,,
767,0.97,6614.474,6617.744,They end up the time at which the fixed term is over.,122,,
768,0.97,6617.744,6621.481,These bills would require just cause.,122,,
769,0.97,6621.481,6629.089,"At the end of that, the just cause would not apply necessarily to the lease, itself.",122,,
770,0.97,6629.089,6650.043,"If we are refusing to renew or continue a rental agreement, council bill 120057 AMENDS the rental agreement regulation portion of the Seattle municipal code requiring that landlords have just cause to refuse to renew or to continue a rental agreement.",122,,
771,0.97,6650.043,6664.924,"Basically, any tenancy will be converted to a month-to-month tenancy unless the landlord offers such a rental agreement for a fixed term, or the landlord has just cause not to do so.",122,,
772,0.97,6664.924,6715.341,"It also includes--the bill also includes the last section in subsection 10 of the just cause Eviction section that allows the tenant to Resend--Resend a mutual termination agreement as Councilmember Morales noted within 10 days of signing the termination agreement if the tenant gives the landlord notice within those 10 days written notice, or if the tenant wants to rescind the agreement after the 10 day period has passed by proving they entered into that agreement, which can be shown like the lack of equal bargaining powers, tenant vulnerability, things of that nature.",122,,
773,0.97,6715.341,6737.831,So the bill is similar in that sense to 120056 in that it also requires that the landlord have just cause not to renew or refuse to continue a tenancy at the end of the fixed term tenancy.,122,,
774,0.97,6737.831,6745.405,120056 also includes revisions about when the offer has to be made.,122,,
775,0.97,6745.405,6747.907,It is 60 or 90 days before the end of the lease term.,122,,
776,0.97,6747.907,6752.545,It gives the tenant 30 days to accept or decline the proposed agreement.,122,,
777,0.97,6752.545,6768.661,It requires the landlord comply with notice provisions and makes the failure to comply [Indiscernible]. I thought it might be helpful to talk about how the bills are practically different.,122,,
778,0.97,6768.661,6789.015,"So, assuming that a landlord has to have just cause, as I mentioned, for these bills, that would be in the circumstance where a landlord does not offer a new rental agreement at the end of the fixed term.",122,,
779,0.97,6789.015,6792.519,"If a landlord does have just cause under either of these bills, then it is no problem.",122,,
780,0.97,6792.519,6793.119,The lease ends.,122,,
781,0.97,6793.119,6798.525,The tenant has a new fixed term lease to start the next tenancy.,122,,
782,0.97,6798.525,6807.033,"But if the landlord does not have just cause, again, both bills require that the landlord offer a new rental agreement.",122,,
783,0.97,6807.033,6831.991,"However, if the tenant declines under Council bill 120056, then the tenancy--excuse me--sorry, if the tenant declines, the original entrance--tenancy ends by its term.",122,,
784,0.97,6831.991,6832.992,The fixed term would terminate.,122,,
785,0.97,6832.992,6844.47,"For Council bill 120057, if the tenant is to decline the offer the landlord makes, the tenancy will convert to a Month- To-Month tenancy.",122,,
786,0.97,6844.47,6853.813,I just note that state bill 1236 does something slightly different.,122,,
787,0.97,6853.813,6857.383,"Sorry, I'm not sure, can you hear me with the dog working?",122,,
788,0.97,6857.383,6858.017,I apologize.,122,,
789,0.97,6858.017,6863.69,We can hear you.,123,,
790,0.97,6863.69,6866.092,Don't worry.,123,,
791,0.97,6866.092,6871.03,"Sorry, I just lost my thought.",124,,
792,0.97,6871.03,6881.741,"The difference lies essentially in what happens when the tenant declines tenancy, whether it converts to a month to month agreement, or ends the tenancy at the end of the original fixed term lease.",124,,
793,0.97,6881.741,6893.653,"The other differences are primarily in approach and where the changes lie in the code, themselves, the code, itself.",124,,
794,0.97,6893.653,6917.443,"120057 makes this change both with in the rental agreement regulations section of the code which is up in 7.24, then talks about the requirement to have just cause to refuse or renew in the just cause section of the bill.",124,,
795,0.97,6917.443,6925.918,So it covers both of those sections while Council bill 120056 puts all the requirements into 2206 which is the Eviction section of the code.,124,,
796,0.97,6925.918,6926.853,So the approaches are different.,124,,
797,0.97,6926.853,6940.099,"For the most part, the impact in terms of what happens if a tenant is offered a new lease and ACCEPTS is similar.",124,,
798,0.97,6940.099,6951.744,"I will stop here if there any questions before I move on to other impacts on Ncci or tenant relocation assistance, if anyone has any questions about the operative provisions of the bill.",124,,
799,0.97,6951.744,6955.114,Thank you for that.,125,,
800,0.97,6955.114,6964.924,"Yeah, we will of course go over the amendments that have been suggested for the bill.",125,,
801,0.97,6964.924,6979.105,"I have some comments, but I want to wait to see if other Councilmembers have comments or questions so far on the presentation.",125,,
802,0.97,6979.105,7012.872,"I would really urge--as I said in the briefing on Monday, I would really urge Councilmembers to ask questions, as recommended, because we want to make sure that we will be voting on--my plan is to have the vote at the next Committee, so please, you know, make sure you ask your questions or relay any of your concerns and Clarifications.",125,,
803,0.97,7012.872,7023.082,"I am not seeing any requests, so go ahead with your subsequent comments.",125,,
804,0.97,7023.082,7028.855,The next part of the memo and what I will talk about now are the impacts that the bill have--on tenant relocation systems.,126,,
805,0.97,7028.855,7061.921,"The state legislation as well as both of these Council bills, none of them directly amend to anything that makes a substance of change to the tenant relocation assistance just a backup, tenant relocation assistance to the glee applies when an owner of a rental unit decides they want to make a change, either substantially rehabilitate a unit, remove youth restrictions, changes of use, or Demolish the unit.",126,,
806,0.97,7061.921,7068.494,"When that happens, they are generally required to go through our Department of constructions and inspections to obtain a relocation license.",126,,
807,0.97,7068.494,7091.317,"In doing so, the SEC I basically helps to figure out if there are low income tenants in the building that are entitled to relocation assistance payments, half of which, the landlord pays, half of which, the city pays, and makes the determination, helps the landlord to figure out the process on that.",126,,
808,0.97,7091.317,7127.587,"As I mentioned, none of these bills directly amend those parts of either the state level relocation protections or the city level relocation but they indirectly impact those sections it has before the state legislation was passed, if a tenant was required to leave because of a use implicated, in this case, during a fixed term tenancy ordering a month-to-month tenancy, the reason for leaving would be because those changes had displaced the tenant.",126,,
809,0.97,7127.587,7146.739,Because that's the reason some of that would require the landlord to go through all the procedures that are associated with tenant relocation license.,126,,
810,0.97,7149.375,7156.282,The third part for the landlord when it comes to fixed term leases that do not convert to month-to-month tenancy is simply to let the lease expire.,126,,
811,0.97,7156.282,7177.803,"In the same way that a landlord doesn't necessarily need just cause to end a tenancy, the landlord will be able to wait until the end of the fixed term tenancy then decide to do all the Demolishing and all the things that come along with tenant relocation and make all those changes.",126,,
812,0.97,7177.803,7184.844,"Because it isn't the changes that are displacing the tenant, but rather the end of the lease term, itself, that is displacing the tenant, the landlord would not necessarily have to go through Trejo.",126,,
813,0.97,7184.844,7207.3,"With passage of House bill 26 as well as potential passage of either 120057 or 120056, there are a reduced number of instances in which a fixed term lease is going to end on its terms either because the just cause requirement kicks in, or because the tenancy will convert to a month-to-month tenancy.",126,,
814,0.97,7207.3,7216.442,That means that the reason for displacement of the tenant also changes.,126,,
815,0.97,7216.442,7221.781,"It is not anymore going to be because the lease ended, but because there are more instances of the tenant being displaced because the change, itself.",126,,
816,0.97,7221.781,7237.396,"That means there will be more instances of landlords that are requiring tenant relocation services, which then could mean they need to make more payments, but at the very least means they have to go through the process.",126,,
817,0.97,7237.396,7242.501,"As I mentioned, they might have to make more payments out to low income tenants that are eligible for Trejo.",126,,
818,0.97,7242.501,7253.613,That leads to some of the impacts on STC I itself.,126,,
819,0.97,7253.613,7260.386,"There is the general increase, I think, in the just cause Eviction workload, that SDC I is going to have to handle.",126,,
820,0.97,7260.386,7271.03,"As the years have gone on, landlords are using rental agreements rather than oral agreements on month-to-month.",126,,
821,0.97,7271.03,7272.498,Many of them are fixed term leases.,126,,
822,0.97,7272.498,7293.819,"Up until now, up until the passage of the House bill and passage of these bills, because they haven't had to have just cause to end the expiring lease agreement, it is a whole set of Tenancies that they did not have to touch.",126,,
823,0.97,7293.819,7310.736,"Now with the passage of these bills, there is likely to be not only an increase in call volumes in terms of landlords and tenants calling to find out what their rights are and how to enforce them, it will also mean that the Department will have to update their notice and outreach materials.",126,,
824,0.97,7310.736,7317.176,It will mean more potential investigation and Enforcemnt of violations.,126,,
825,0.97,7317.176,7340.766,"Sdci has jurisdiction over the notices that go out in terms of Eviction are proper, so when somebody comes to them and says that something is missing on a notice, they are the entity that enforces that piece.",126,,
826,0.97,7340.766,7347.106,"Knowing now that they are are going to be more of those notices going out because just cause will apply more often, it means that that caseload is likely to increase.",126,,
827,0.97,7347.106,7373.099,"The resulting changes in trail will also improve the caseload as they are the ones who do reviews of what will be what--excuse me--whether a tenant is eligible for relocation assistance, or if the landlord needs to go through the process, the increased number of landlords that will need to go through the relocation license process, all that Implicates more workload for Sdci.",126,,
828,0.97,7373.099,7375.901,"Although, it is not entirely clear with the level of the increase will be.",126,,
829,0.97,7375.901,7399.625,"We might not be able to tell until the legislation fully goes into effect and there are more applications for relocation licenses that come in and more calls that come in asking about landlord rights, Council members might want to consider whether there will be a need to provide more support to the Department in order to continue to do that work.",126,,
830,0.97,7399.625,7416.842,The Councilmembers have reached out to us to hopefully be at the virtual table on the 25th to answer questions from Councilmembers about the workload situation.,126,,
831,0.97,7416.842,7419.779,We are still waiting to hear back on whether or not that's going to happen.,126,,
832,0.97,7419.779,7428.387,I am hoping that will give Councilmembers an opportunity to drill down a little bit into what the impact--both the state legislation and what these bills will be.,126,,
833,0.97,7428.387,7431.524,I will pause again if there are any questions before I dive into potential amendments.,126,,
834,0.97,7431.524,7432.091,Thank you.,127,,
835,0.97,7432.091,7437.663,I see Councilmember Morales has raised your hand.,127,,
836,0.97,7437.663,7438.063,Go ahead.,127,,
837,0.97,7438.063,7441.767,"Yeah, this might be something we have to wait until May 25th.",128,,
838,0.97,7441.767,7456.515,Do you have any sense--have you heard from them any idea of baseline if this is the extra FTE or three Ftes--what we might be looking at in order to make this work?,128,,
839,0.97,7456.515,7457.983,I do have a number of Ftes.,129,,
840,0.97,7457.983,7472.131,What they indicated was they anticipate a 20 to 30% jump in caseload or call volume.,129,,
841,0.97,7472.131,7478.737,"I will have to double check on that number whether they were Referencing call volume or caseload, but that is the first sort of estimate I have heard.",129,,
842,0.97,7478.737,7489.148,"So, hopefully, we will have more information as I continue to work with Sdci over the next couple weeks before the last of these bills.",129,,
843,0.97,7489.148,7498.357,"Thank you, also.",130,,
844,0.97,7498.357,7499.859,I see Colton has raised his hand.,130,,
845,0.97,7499.859,7500.159,Go ahead.,130,,
846,0.97,7500.159,7502.294,I just wanted to ask a quick question.,131,,
847,0.97,7502.294,7514.173,Do we happen to know when there is going to be more money going to Hgp and others who can help Renters like myself get out of debt?,131,,
848,0.97,7514.173,7530.456,I believe that Sdci has allocated much of the funding that was appropriated to them for distribution over the past couple months.,132,,
849,0.97,7530.456,7531.991,There may still be some funding left.,132,,
850,0.97,7531.991,7539.798,"I'm not sure if it's direct rental assistance, I'm happy to double check, Ted, I'm not sure if you have additional information.",132,,
851,0.97,7539.798,7541.7,I did a little bit of research into this.,133,,
852,0.97,7541.7,7547.806,There are different sources of rental assistance funds.,133,,
853,0.97,7547.806,7580.706,"The King County rental assistance funds, they are currently in a time where landlords--can apply for rental assistance money, and on May 17th they will open up applications for Renters to apply, and--I can followed--and there is more money coming from the Federal grant money that has not gone out yet.",133,,
854,0.97,7580.706,7582.141,I don't know when that's going out.,133,,
855,0.97,7582.141,7585.244,I'm happy to follow up with you.,133,,
856,0.97,7585.244,7586.445,"Okay, Yeah, perfect, thank you.",134,,
857,0.97,7586.445,7588.747,It would be nice to be sent an Email or something.,134,,
858,0.97,7588.747,7591.417,Certainly.,135,,
859,0.97,7591.417,7593.586,"Thank you, Kolton, for the question.",136,,
860,0.97,7593.586,7603.228,Thank you to nausea and Ted for the important information.,136,,
861,0.97,7603.228,7604.73,"Yes, the office will continue to follow up.",136,,
862,0.97,7604.73,7613.539,"Kolton and other Renters, please stay in touch with Ted and Jonathan and my office for technical questions.",136,,
863,0.97,7613.539,7616.742,We will absolutely work with city Council and staff members who are always extremely helpful.,136,,
864,0.97,7616.742,7635.427,"Just in terms of the overview that also gave which I really appreciate, I just want to make sure other Renters and community members who are watching this, just to make sure that they are clear about some of the things that also mentioned.",136,,
865,0.97,7635.427,7658.417,"One of the Acronyms that also used--I just wanted to make everyone knows is tenant relocation assistance ordinance which is the law that requires relocation assistance for those who are displaced because the landlord intends to Demolish or Redevelop the building, and this is law in Seattle.",136,,
866,0.97,7658.417,7690.549,"As a side note, I would say some people in public comments say Renters need relocation assistance when they are displaced by rent increases, in other words, when they experience what we would call an economic Eviction, notably when they are displaced every development or demolition of the building because the Renters relocation costs are the same regardless of what the landlords reason might be for their displacement, relocation costs money.",136,,
867,0.97,7690.549,7721.78,"So definitely something we want to come back to, in fact, that is legislation that is being drafted already by my office [Indiscernible] we are making sure it's updated and ready for discussion and those are soon Úin the committee to make sure that there is economic Eviction relocation assistance, you know, back to the just cause question, it is important to feature legislation [Indiscernible] with No-Fault and for these Evictions, and that--I appreciate you going over that.",136,,
868,0.97,7721.78,7751.076,"I have some comments on the amendment that I proposed by Sdci, then hopefully, [Indiscernible] if you have any comments on that, that would be great--I want to pause and see if other Council members who haven't spoken yet will have questions or comments or concerns, please, I would really urge you to bring them forward because we have also here to answer questions.",136,,
869,0.97,7751.076,7770.729,"Councilmember Pedersen, did you have--sorry, Councilmember Pedersen is indicating silently --",136,,
870,0.97,7770.729,7771.93,No comments at this time.,137,,
871,0.97,7771.93,7773.599,I made Commentsof the previous meeting.,137,,
872,0.97,7773.599,7773.899,Thank you.,137,,
873,0.97,7773.899,7775.834,Council member warriors?,138,,
874,0.97,7775.834,7780.139,"You are on mute, sorry, we can't hear you.",138,,
875,0.97,7780.139,7780.939,Sorry about that.,139,,
876,0.97,7780.939,7783.408,I'm actually okay.,139,,
877,0.97,7783.408,7798.357,I didn't know if you were going to discuss the recent signing of the other bill in conjunction?,139,,
878,0.97,7798.357,7802.461,"Yeah, so I think what you are Referencing is House bill 1236 which the governor signed, I believe, yesterday.",140,,
879,0.97,7802.461,7813.839,So that is the bill that I had talked about just a little bit early in the presentation regarding estate white just cause provisions.,140,,
880,0.97,7813.839,7843.836,Let me just make sure here real quick--I'm making sure with the office to see how that will happen.,140,,
881,0.97,7843.836,7845.837,I will get into that before the next committee meeting.,140,,
882,0.97,7845.837,7858.517,I will just NOTE the House bill does in the circumstance.,140,,
883,0.97,7858.517,7872.698,"So under the bill as passed, it requires just cause for fixed term leases that do not convert to month-to-month, but only in specific circumstances.",140,,
884,0.97,7872.698,7875.4,Just cause is required unless the initial agreement is for a year or more.,140,,
885,0.97,7875.4,7897.356,"So any sort of one-year lease is going to be exempt from just cause, or if the initial term is multiple successive leases of at least six months, so since you started at the beginning of the tenancy the first time, you sign a rental agreement for 6 months.",140,,
886,0.97,7897.356,7899.024,"After that, you keep entering into six-month leases.",140,,
887,0.97,7899.024,7901.26,You are not required to have just cause in that scenario.,140,,
888,0.97,7901.26,7912.271,It looks like it has some enumerated clauses where you can make exceptions to that.,141,,
889,0.97,7912.271,7912.671,Yeah.,142,,
890,0.97,7912.671,7921.046,There are--and we are working to figure out just causes in Seattle and just causes that were passed to the state level.,142,,
891,0.97,7921.046,7921.88,They are working together.,142,,
892,0.97,7921.88,7923.682,That is work in progress.,142,,
893,0.97,7923.682,7926.952,I will have more on that.,142,,
894,0.97,7926.952,7927.953,We are still working on it.,142,,
895,0.97,7927.953,7930.589,I will circle back to that piece.,142,,
896,0.97,7930.589,7933.258,That's okay.,143,,
897,0.97,7933.258,7933.659,Thank you.,143,,
898,0.97,7933.659,7939.197,I saw Mike Chad from Saturday night live.,143,,
899,0.97,7939.197,7939.398,Okay.,143,,
900,0.97,7939.398,7940.632,"Thank you, Councilmember Juarez.",144,,
901,0.97,7940.632,7944.303,I appreciate the question.,144,,
902,0.97,7944.303,7945.304,We are at 4:12 now.,144,,
903,0.97,7945.304,7948.974,Did you want to talk about the amendments?,144,,
904,0.97,7948.974,7954.112,I will quickly go through what the amendments are.,145,,
905,0.97,7954.112,7965.724,"Sdci, they had several with suggestions about how to amend the bill.",145,,
906,0.97,7965.724,7967.326,So the first is a notice requirement.,145,,
907,0.97,7967.326,7986.912,"So it would require that tenants are given a minimum 60 days notice if they don't plan to renew the lease, or longer if the specific just cause for which they are saying they have to not renew the lease requires more advanced notice.",145,,
908,0.97,7986.912,7988.947,The amount differs based on what the just cause is.,145,,
909,0.97,7988.947,7990.716,We are working on language to basically reflect.,145,,
910,0.97,7990.716,7991.817,The minimum should be 60 days.,145,,
911,0.97,7991.817,7996.321,"If the just cause requirement requires something different, that should be what the requirement says it should be.",145,,
912,0.97,7996.321,8018.377,And part of the notice should be that both the just cause and the reasons for failing to renew or offered to make a new rental offer--second potential amendment is around the rescission clause.,145,,
913,0.97,8018.377,8028.72,"So as I mentioned, the way that the bill is currently drafted, if a tenant wants to rescind the termination agreement, it just requires notice.",145,,
914,0.97,8028.72,8031.823,"If they wanted 10 days after, they have to prove it was entered Improvidently.",145,,
915,0.97,8031.823,8063.622,"What we heard from Sdci was--in their work doing the landlord, tenant work, they came across--there are mutual termination agreements that are entered into when the bargaining power is equal, when the tenant has been represented by an attorney, they decide with full knowledge of their rights and what the impact of the mutual termination agreement is that they want to terminate the agreement.",145,,
916,0.97,8063.622,8076.134,There is also requirements in Federal law around subsidized housing.,145,,
917,0.97,8076.134,8082.107,"Section 8 vouchers for example, you need a mutual termination agreement to be able to take your current section a voucher and move it to the next tenancy.",145,,
918,0.97,8082.107,8085.944,So we talk through ways not to discuss this process.,145,,
919,0.97,8085.944,8092.951,"In this current legislation, so working on language to make sure that those circumstances are reflected in the rescission language.",145,,
920,0.97,8092.951,8104.162,The last potential amendment is related--it will amend the current section as proposed.,145,,
921,0.97,8104.162,8113.939,There is a Pre-Existing problem in the code that the potential amendment would solve.,145,,
922,0.97,8113.939,8149.975,"So as it currently stands, when the owner a single-family home and they want to sell their home it requires just cause to end the tenancy if they want to sell it without the tenancy in place--excuse me--the issue is that that particular subsection of the code references a single-family dwelling unit, and there is a whole Subset of definitions that interact in this complicated way that basically means Townhome owners--single unit property owners do not fit into the definition of the unit.",145,,
923,0.97,8149.975,8158.783,"It leaves Townhouse and Condo owners, for example, under different protections.",145,,
924,0.97,8158.783,8163.488,"When they want to sell their properties without a tenancy intact, they have no ability to use just cause to Evict the tenant.",145,,
925,0.97,8163.488,8231.089,"That results in either having to wait until the fixed term tenancy is over in order to sell the place or figure out with the tenant a way to have the tenant move voluntarily or offer incentives to the tenant to do so or try to sell the property with the tenancy and attached--the memo doesn't weigh in on whether any of those things are good or bad policy decisions, just that there is inconsistency in the way single-family homeowners are able to use this just cause and town and Condo units are not able to use just cause because it is a state-level registration that as well as the potential passage of these bills that will reduce the number of instances in which a fixed term lease just ends on its terms--there will be--it will make it more difficult for a Townhome or Condo unit owner to wait until the end of the lease term and sell their property without a tenancy intact.",145,,
926,0.97,8231.089,8243.868,That would essentially mean that there are decreased opportunities to do that in the scenario where a single-family home owner could use the just cause.,145,,
927,0.97,8243.868,8284.576,"So what the amendment would do, it would add the term single unit property to the just cause sections of both single-family homeowners as well as Condo and Townhome owners could use the just cause--the just cause reason in the same way whether the existence of this as a just cause is a--is a good or bad policy--is not what this weighs in on--it is simply the inconsistency that exists between who can use the just cause and that's what would be amended through this potential--through this potential amendment.",145,,
928,0.97,8284.576,8294.219,Do you have any more questions?,146,,
929,0.97,8294.219,8305.463,"Real quick, I wanted to circle back, Councilmember Morales had asked about the Ftes so I went back and pulled up my notes really quickly--indicated that about a 20% increase in caseload will require one FTE.",147,,
930,0.97,8305.463,8307.732,We will have to see what the increase in caseload is.,147,,
931,0.97,8307.732,8325.684,"They did reference about 20% of their calls over the past three years have been about just cause Eviction, so that is only anticipated to increase given the changes that are coming in, so I just wanted to circle back and let you know.",147,,
932,0.97,8325.684,8327.085,"Thank you, I appreciate that, AjA.",148,,
933,0.97,8327.085,8327.952,"Thank you, AjA.",149,,
934,0.97,8327.952,8347.572,"I have comments on these amendments proposed by [Indiscernible], once again, wanted to give other committee members an opportunity to ask any questions on the amendments first.",149,,
935,0.97,8347.572,8353.978,I'm not seeing any committee member wanting to ask questions or make any comments on the amendments.,149,,
936,0.97,8353.978,8369.828,"Nausea, thank you for going over the amendments proposed by the Department [Indiscernible]--I will just make some comments on the number one in your memo and number three in your memo.",149,,
937,0.97,8369.828,8371.629,I don't have comments on number two just yet.,149,,
938,0.97,8371.629,8451.609,"But on amendment number one, I think this, the way [Indiscernible] reports this is combining the approach--the technical approach in terms of the outcome of what the bills are, in terms of the technical approach taken by the draft from my office and then it combines with this draft--so this is the version of the bill that I definitely want to include this amendment, in fact, Similarly, Sdci included a statement that at the end of a rental time, the lease transitions to a month to month, which would be a way to amend [Indiscernible] to combine [Indiscernible]--in other words, you know, [Indiscernible] it is basically combining those approaches and in fact it's along the lines [Indiscernible] to do so, as I said, [Indiscernible] the same thing.",149,,
939,0.97,8451.609,8500.925,"It is important we move this forward while the Council numbers draft does not give a Timeline for when they need to offer a new lease, the Timeline is usually enforced by other parts of the law like the 60 day notice required for rental [Indiscernible] by requiring a new lease in advance as the draft from my office does, it effectively Wipes the [Indiscernible] from rising and that is [Indiscernible] by the initiative that was passed by Renters in that city and any reality renders genuinely want peace of mind in relation to their lease so I don't believe that this amendment makes a big shift one way or another, but I will definitely support including this if this bill is booted on.",149,,
940,0.97,8500.925,8545.67,"Then, amendment 3 from the [Indiscernible], also regarding the draft from my office, I want to be very clear, I do not support this amendment from we can understand--I mean, I welcome Sdci to explain this differently, if you have a different expert nation--as far as my office understands it, this would create new loopholes, new ways that landlords could Evict Renters--of course, if that's the case, I won't support this--no property owner should Evict Renters to sell the property.",149,,
941,0.97,8545.67,8575.667,"There's no reason they can't sell the property with a Renter in the property and that happens all the time that amendment would allow more property owners to Evict for this reason than is currently the case so in other words as also you currently said the memo that you have presented does not comment on whether or not it would be good to add this amendment, it is merely pointing a question of consistency, but I don't think consistency is the end in itself.",149,,
942,0.97,8575.667,8614.372,"Renters rights are the end we are trying to achieve, and we don't want to in the name of consistency put forward amendments that would end up potentially hurting more Renters than currently and as far as we understand the amendment would allow more property owners to Evict for this reason that is currently the case because it adds townhouses and Condo owners to the property owners who can Evict their Renters when they want to sell the unit but really we should be going in the opposite direction [Indiscernible] if we want to build a real tenants bill of rights in this city so I will stop there to see if any other Council members want to have any questions or comments--and also if you have anything [Indiscernible].",149,,
943,0.97,8614.372,8623.581,I just add these are issues the Sdci raised generally about these bills would be the amendments themselves are not proposed by Sdci.,150,,
944,0.97,8623.581,8628.92,They are proposed by the Council members.,150,,
945,0.97,8628.92,8631.189,Just to be clear about how the executive has been involved.,150,,
946,0.97,8631.189,8642.4,Thank you for clarifying that.,151,,
947,0.97,8642.4,8643.401,I was not clear on that.,151,,
948,0.97,8643.401,8645.47,I did not know the amendment was from Councilmember Morales.,151,,
949,0.97,8645.47,8646.971,I assumed it was from the Department.,151,,
950,0.97,8646.971,8647.772,I appreciate the clarification.,151,,
951,0.97,8647.772,8648.272,Councilmember Morales?,151,,
952,0.97,8648.272,8648.539,Sure.,152,,
953,0.97,8648.539,8653.444,So I will just address a couple things.,152,,
954,0.97,8653.444,8671.329,"With regard to the first one as we said, Sdci has said this would bring the law in line with their system of Enforcements regarding the notice landlords give so we want to make sure that is included.",152,,
955,0.97,8671.329,8685.343,Then what we understand is that through those conversations about the single-family and single-family unit is that it has been kind of a long- standing issue with the code.,152,,
956,0.97,8685.343,8690.748,This is an opportunity to fix it.,152,,
957,0.97,8690.748,8693.351,It brings those situations under cost protection.,152,,
958,0.97,8693.351,8716.074,"And I think you know, I do want to make the point that Condo and Townhome owners owned a large bulk of the rental stock in Seattle, so part of the approach here is to ensure they don't retaliate by taking their units off the market.",152,,
959,0.97,8716.074,8728.786,"And then I don't think you have any questions about the precision, so I will leave that be.",152,,
960,0.97,8728.786,8739.464,Her--do--any of the Council members have any points to add?,152,,
961,0.97,8739.464,8751.509,"I--I will wait for a second--I don't want committee members to feel like they don't have time to speak, so please let me know.",152,,
962,0.97,8751.509,8757.381,Did you raise your hand?,152,,
963,0.97,8757.381,8764.388,No!,153,,
964,0.97,8764.388,8790.648,"-- I wanted to comment--I know we have to look at the legality, all the INS and outs of the bill, but I think making a stronger voice is uniting the bills, making sure if it passes, which I believe it will, because we have awesome Council members who are here today with us, and I know that everybody works hard on the bill.",153,,
965,0.97,8790.648,8811.202,"We have community members and everything like that, but the goal is always to unite, to have a big United front and making sure we are all working together closely on a bill that will just be great for the community.",153,,
966,0.97,8811.202,8812.37,So that's what I wanted to say.,153,,
967,0.97,8812.37,8830.655,"I want to thank Councilmember Juarez, Pederson, and the other Councilmember, Andrew Lewis, for really hearing the community voices.",153,,
968,0.97,8830.655,8842.7,"You know, this is why I do the work that I do, is working closely with elected officials to pass these important legislation.",153,,
969,0.97,8842.7,8850.107,"Everything you guys are doing, House bill 1236, we are glad we have statewide just cause, but there was a lot of things we weren't happy about.",153,,
970,0.97,8850.107,8857.515,"Those are the things we still have to work out, you know, as a United front for all of us working together.",153,,
971,0.97,8857.515,8862.453,"That's all I have to say, thank you for the opportunity.",153,,
972,0.97,8862.453,8888.546,"Thank you, violet, I really appreciate your emphasis on having unity in order to make sure we don't end up putting things like the state legislation did where they address some problems but created new problems, we definitely don't want to do that.",154,,
973,0.97,8888.546,8890.047,We don't want to create any new problems.,154,,
974,0.97,8890.047,8894.252,"In fact, I wanted to see if any other of the community panelists who are here wanted to speak as well.",154,,
975,0.97,8894.252,8895.72,"I mean, I appreciate everybody's input.",154,,
976,0.97,8895.72,8906.53,"I did have a comment on the amendment 3. I mean, I think it is--at this moment, I'm still not going to support it.",154,,
977,0.97,8906.53,8920.778,I don't understand how--what we are to clarify is a list of just causes is not a protection for Renters.,154,,
978,0.97,8920.778,8923.481,It is a list of exceptions when landlords are allowed to Evict people.,154,,
979,0.97,8923.481,8933.324,"In other words, adding another just cause does not actually add protections.",154,,
980,0.97,8933.324,8934.091,It adds more exceptions.,154,,
981,0.97,8934.091,8938.796,"In fact, as I said before, no landlord should be able to Evict Renters in the name of selling property.",154,,
982,0.97,8938.796,8951.008,"There are so many Renters, countless tenants have faced displacement and faced being forced to relocate because landlords were doing that.",154,,
983,0.97,8951.008,9030.121,"In fact, that is one of the things that fuels the real estate market that is underwritten, you know, by Wall Street banks, essentially, this is the bottom of all of this--because repeated real estate deals are what generate massive profits to a lot of the people who live in the financial sector and so selling the properties--it is a high incentive in terms of [Indiscernible]--it's true that not all of them are corporate landlords--I just want to be clear I am happy to come back to this discussion to make sure we have everything clarified in preparation for the next committee and I am looking forward to talking to Councilmember Morales is all it's--[Indiscernible] it's a list of exceptions when landlords are allowed to Evict people and I don't understand why we would want to expand that list of Evictions that's--that's--that's what I understand for now--once again I would invite any Council members before we close this item or any Additionl comments to be made on this--as I said, we will be coming back to the meeting on the 25th.",154,,
984,0.97,9030.121,9033.09,"Sean, did you want to speak?",154,,
985,0.97,9033.09,9042.867,"Yeah, I guess I wanted to echo your question for Councilman Mireles.",155,,
986,0.97,9042.867,9060.851,"It doesn't really seem to help Renters or small landlords to be able to Evict their tenants prior to selling the unit to another landlord, who are increasingly the type of buyer, it seems, in the city, why can't we require the tendency to continue beyond this sale unless it meets the just cause Eviction?",155,,
987,0.97,9060.851,9073.731,Was there a rationale for this amendment that incorporates that or addresses the issue?,155,,
988,0.97,9073.731,9090.815,"It would be helpful--my understanding and my conversations with the Department, my understanding was that often, Townhomes and condos can be less expensive to rent than entire single-family homes.",156,,
989,0.97,9090.815,9159.517,"So because of that, if the Condo owner feels--for whatever reason, they don't want to sell with the tendency in place, they have a tenant, unless they own the Townhome and Condo and have it for a limited period of time they want to sell after a shorter period of time, the incentive for them to rent would be if they were able to use just cause to give the tenant notice and then have the tenant be able to use that in moving out rather than trying to potentially use some other just cause to make their case or do it through a huge rent increase and so given the way that things are now, the Townhouse and Condo owners cannot put their units on the rental markets for a short period of time if they think they can't sell with the tenant being in place.",156,,
990,0.97,9159.517,9162.52,"And again, this isn't a pro or con.",156,,
991,0.97,9162.52,9202.126,It is just the reasoning around why it could potentially decrease the landlords--or the potential landlords or units from offering either what could potentially be lower rent properties to tenants or shorter term leases to tenants if they are holding onto that property for sale so I hope that's helpful.,156,,
992,0.97,9207.131,9208.532,"Thank you, object, for adding that.",157,,
993,0.97,9208.532,9225.082,I just--I mean--I know you are not making a political argument one way or another but I think this amendment is problematic as what I said from what we understand we will continue the discussion but my office will not support anything that expands landlord Eviction and I'm also not clear--I don't know if Renters were consulted on amendment three.,157,,
994,0.97,9225.082,9299.556,"I'm sure landlords want it of course--I think--you know, expanding the exceptions to landlords available to landlords to legally affect only makes Evictions of Renters easier and also but also this argument Furthermore that allowing Renters to be evicted easier will allow more affordable units in the market I don't--to me that sounds like a new level argument we hear these new level items all the time including from [Indiscernible] minimum wage any number of businesses that [Indiscernible] jobs and there is no data so it would be useful if we can work with central staff in looking at what evidence there is for the city Council to make this concession for Townhouse and Condo owners you know and if we don't that they will or they will in the future or have in the past [Indiscernible] I mean I don't know any such evidence but maybe there is.",157,,
995,0.97,9299.556,9310.534,We will take a very rigorous viewpoint of this but I will say that a lot of the arguments that landlords make that they will take the rental off the market if this happens they will take the rental off the market if that happens that is sociable and entirely and it total.,157,,
996,0.97,9310.534,9311.635,There is no evidence to show.,157,,
997,0.97,9311.635,9323.681,The fact is they make that argument every time we passed Renters say [Indiscernible] fill in the blank you know whatever it is they are talking about they will say well if you do this then it will do that for Renters and landlords both but that's not--that's not true.,157,,
998,0.97,9323.681,9335.893,We know it's not supported by data so we will look forward to--to continue that discussion off-line to make sure we have the evidence for that.,157,,
999,0.97,9335.893,9336.493,-- it's 4:35.,157,,
1000,0.97,9336.493,9457.514,If Councilmembers don't have further comment [Indiscernible] on the 25th especially making sure we clarify all the amendments there's another rental rights bill that is also coming on the 25th and I want to make sure that--I know we have very limited time because we have the [Indiscernible] and I appreciate Councilmembers being very patient in these committee Minis because we are discussing so many bills to make sure we hear from Renters so we want to--if everyone's okay with it--I want to quickly move to the last agenda item and just quickly go through a short presentation that my staff have prepared and [Indiscernible] the committee will quickly go over the presentation and make sure we have a little bit of overview of the bill which is to ban school year of Evictions of schoolchildren and their families and educators and also other public--sorry--public school staff [Indiscernible] sorry on the previous line let's also look at the evidence to this idea that condos are cheaper to rent now and you know and how that impacts what we are doing [Indiscernible] so let's come back to that as well so I just wanted to mention that about that thank you also really appreciate it thank you Council members for engaging in this Ted is in the interest of time can you quickly go over this presentation and obviously this is a very very important bill because [Indiscernible] devastating acts on education and this presentation has some really important [Indiscernible] and also some service of progress we made [Indiscernible] thank you [Indiscernible].,157,,
1001,0.97,9457.514,9458.115,Thank you.,158,,
1002,0.97,9458.115,9462.786,I will go through this quickly because I know we are over time!,158,,
1003,0.97,9462.786,9476.099,"So the Council bill 12 0046 prohibits the Eviction of schoolchildren, their families and educators during the course of the school year.",158,,
1004,0.97,9476.099,9502.459,The one crucial fact is the homelessness amongst schoolchildren in Seattle is just shocking and devastating portion of public schools--the most recent data shows one out of 14 public-school students is homeless during the school year.,158,,
1005,0.97,9502.459,9509.132,"Right now, Seattle public school students are struggling with homelessness in different ways.",158,,

1007,0.97,9512.236,9586.91,"It is over 4000 students, and that includes people who are couch Surfing, people who are in transitional housing, people who are in shelters--a lot of different places where students are--buffer over 4000 students that do not have Stabl housing--and--stopping the Evictions of school-age families is a racial justice and black lives matter issue as well because the percentage of homeless students who are black is 40% which is a much higher percentage than what would be proportionate--we will get to it later in the presentation--the data also shows that when people--when children are evicted and have housing instability, that then has a devastating impact on their education, so that means not only is homelessness and Evictions a disproportionate harm in itself, but it also then carries over to disproportionate harm in children's educations.",158,,
1008,0.97,9586.91,9599.623,The vast majority of children who were evicted in Seattle had to change schools as a result which is a huge--a huge burden on their education.,158,,
1009,0.97,9599.623,9632.155,This is from a report commissioned by the women's Commission [Indiscernible] 87.5% of families interviewed said that--said that their children's school performance suffered very much following the Eviction.,158,,
1010,0.97,9632.155,9636.693,-- 87.5%--that is consistent with all the National data on the information on homeless students who have a lower graduation rate.,158,,
1011,0.97,9636.693,9638.495,It makes sense that this would be the case.,158,,
1012,0.97,9638.495,9644.401,Imagine trying to do your homework and study and just Prioritize your schoolwork when you don't have stable housing.,158,,
1013,0.97,9644.401,9648.105,It is--should be no surprise to anybody.,158,,
1014,0.97,9648.105,9656.58,That nationwide--the academic research agrees that Evictions harm students in learning and development.,158,,
1015,0.97,9656.58,9680.27,"Here are quotes from various studies which I won't read now because we are overtime--but we will send out this presentation to committee members after the fact--and there is also research that this bill also prevents the Eviction of educators, and there's also plenty of academic research that shows that turnover of school staff also has a damaging impact on student learning.",158,,
1016,0.97,9680.27,9699.022,"So, council bill 1246 relating to residential tendencies for Evictions of children and their families, educators and the school year, who does it protect?",158,,
1017,0.97,9699.022,9700.824,It protects all children and students up through 12th grade.,158,,
1018,0.97,9700.824,9711.568,"If somebody is a 12th grade student even though they are 18 or 19, they would still be protected.",158,,
1019,0.97,9711.568,9730.153,"So all students up through 12th grade an all children and families because obviously you can't--you know--not Evict a first grader but evicted their guardians--it doesn't work--and school employees including preschool, elementary school, middle school, high school.",158,,
1020,0.97,9730.153,9731.188,When are the Evictions banned?,158,,
1021,0.97,9731.188,9734.524,"Obviously, we would love to ban Evictions of schoolchildren.",158,,
1022,0.97,9734.524,9738.095,Period.,158,,
1023,0.97,9738.095,9740.964,This bill bans the Eviction of schoolchildren during the academic school year.,158,,
1024,0.97,9740.964,9754.678,"So for example, if those--if this was in place, it runs from September 4TH to June 18th 2021.",158,,
1025,0.97,9754.678,9757.114,It goes based on the school year of Seattle public schools.,158,,
1026,0.97,9757.114,9761.017,There are some exceptions to this bill.,158,,
1027,0.97,9761.017,9798.522,"The times when the Evictions are not banned is when other laws require the Evictions, for example, if the building is condemned and the landlord is required by law to Evict the tenants then this protection is not in place or the landlord is required by law to reduce the number of occupants in the building or these statewide laws regarding serious illegal or dangerous activity in the unit--that--those are also exceptions.",158,,
1028,0.97,9798.522,9800.023,There are some precedents to this bill.,158,,
1029,0.97,9800.023,9820.477,"We will be able to present more on this going forward, but one place that we looked at when we were preparing this legislation is the ban on winter Evictions that Sawant that was passed on February 2020.",158,,
1030,0.97,9820.477,9830.987,"That bill--that bill has a legislative sense, the same structure as this bill.",158,,
1031,0.97,9830.987,9834.257,It has a time of year when Evictions--when Renters have a defense against Eviction.,158,,
1032,0.97,9834.257,9840.397,The landlord does not succeed in Evicting Renters during that period of time.,158,,
1033,0.97,9840.397,9845.902,So this bill uses the same legislative structure as that.,158,,
1034,0.97,9845.902,9849.806,The bill banning winter Evictions goes from December 1ST to March 1ST.,158,,
1035,0.97,9849.806,9856.98,"It is not schoolchildren, it is Renters in general.",158,,
1036,0.97,9856.98,9880.804,"This bill is tied to schoolchildren, families and educators, it is for the entire course of the academic year--another precedent to look at is San Francisco rent ordinance section 37.9 J that was amended in 2016 to similarly protect schoolchildren, students, educators from Eviction during the school year.",158,,
1037,0.97,9880.804,9895.852,That bill as we discussed is far more limited than this bill because it is limited to only certain types of No-Fault Evictions like if the landlord wants to Redevelop the property.,158,,
1038,0.97,9895.852,9902.826,That is--but the San Francisco legislation does not include things like nonpayment of rent and those issues.,158,,
1039,0.97,9902.826,9916.339,There is community for support behind the idea behind the Eviction of schoolchildren.,158,,

1041,0.97,10027.55,10047.504,"Can I ask--thank you for the presentation--it was extremely helpful--one thing I had to add about how is the draft legislation that they put forward different than the bill that was passed--that was passed in San Francisco you know--what they are doing differently, here.",159,,
1042,0.97,10047.504,10067.924,"We looked to the bill in San Francisco for a lot of guidance about who would be--who would be covered throughout San Francisco--it covers schoolchildren, their families and educators and covers all educators.",160,,
1043,0.97,10067.924,10087.61,"So we were able to get a lot of good information on how to define those terms for San Francisco although obviously these definitions are updated to match other parts of the Seattle municipal code, however, the bill in San Francisco in terms of what sorts of Evictions it covers is far more limited.",160,,
1044,0.97,10087.61,10101.858,"It covers certain No-Fault Evictions from the landlord who wants to Demolish the building or do substantial reservations in the building and wants to Evict the tenants for those reasons in San Francisco, those are the types of Evictions that are not covered.",160,,
1045,0.97,10101.858,10167.323,Those types of Evictions are not covered by the bill by Council bill 1246--Council bill 1246 also includes the types of Evictions like being behind on your rent or not following certain terms of the rent and those are the overwhelming majority of the Evictions that happen in Seattle--losing home report commissioned by the Seattle limits Commission went and broke down where the reasons why people were being infected--the formal reason that was brought to court--it is well over 90% of the reasons are things that would--well over 90% of the actual Evictions that were seen in King County--in King County court--well over 90% of them [Indiscernible] that are covered by this.,160,,
1046,0.97,10167.323,10167.924,Thank you.,161,,
1047,0.97,10167.924,10168.558,That's very clarifying.,161,,
1048,0.97,10168.558,10192.348,It's important as he said to keep in mind the overwhelming numbers of people--Renters who are evicted just because they are not able to keep up with rent for various reasons now of course that's the paramount reason and that's also the reason you accumulated that was because [Indiscernible] jobs and income during the recession and as Colton pointed out many have still not recovered.,161,,
1049,0.97,10192.348,10198.054,I am not seeing any hands raised I am inclined to adjourn the committee very soon.,161,,
1050,0.97,10198.054,10340.963,I just want to register quickly--[Indiscernible] may 25th we will vote the just cause--voting the just cause [Indiscernible] the ban on the Evictions of school kids and their families and educators and school staff--[Indiscernible] forward for potential vote so I would just reiterate [Indiscernible] questions concerns comments please let us know if there are any amendments [Indiscernible] the Timeline and also just want to share because this was on our public meetings happening over zoom there was a question from a Renter Sean Butterfield in the chat that I want to read out to make sure we record it then come back to it--the question is having a tenant in the [Indiscernible] sale I don't understand why it would if the new owner wants to Redevelop the property or move into the property they have those options under the just cause Eviction criteria thank you Sean for the question and just to make clear to members of the public the question goes back to the earlier discussion about the amendment that proposed [Indiscernible] Mariah Ellis proposed to expand the exceptions that are available to enlarge to also include Townhouse and Condo owners as well which as I said in my review that is actually a step backward for Renters [Indiscernible] we want to make progress [Indiscernible] we will come back to all of these discussions and if there are no other comments I will once again thank all the committee members and [Indiscernible] public comment who joined in the committee [Indiscernible] for your input and also thanks to all the Renters and working ordinary people who are getting organized--the various people have demonstrated--thank you for your patience [Indiscernible] and I will on that NOTE adjourn.,161,,
