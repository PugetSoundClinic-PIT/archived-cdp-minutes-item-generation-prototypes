77,0.97,419.352,440.673,Materials that you have that are attached to the agenda is a brief memorandum from me that describes some background.,10,,
78,0.97,440.673,443.109,There is a recommendation on the contract Rezoning extension from Sdci.,10,,
79,0.97,443.109,444.31,There is written comment received by Sdci.,10,,
80,0.97,444.31,445.645,This is on the contract extension.,10,,
81,0.97,445.645,449.816,There is a draft bill that would extend the contract for an additional two years and adopt an amended property use.,10,,
82,0.97,449.816,456.122,"So as Councilmember Dan Strauss requested, I will talk about this and distinguish it.",10,,
83,0.97,456.122,459.659,I will talk about the criteria that the Seattle municipal code provides for consideration.,10,,
84,0.97,459.659,474.14,"So by way of background, as mentioned in the introduction, this property was Rezoned in 2017.",10,,
85,0.97,474.14,478.444,"It was a contract Rezoning, this means that it was a Site- specific reason with an adopted property use and development agreement.",10,,
86,0.97,478.444,479.445,This is the contract Rezoning.,10,,
87,0.97,479.445,480.279,I will share my screen.,10,,
88,0.97,480.279,487.186,"I will show you in the world, where in the world this is.",10,,
89,0.97,488.921,494.26,Can you all see that?,10,,
90,0.97,494.26,496.095,I am not totally sure here.,10,,
91,0.97,496.095,512.178,"We are looking at Sdci, we are looking at their GIS projected on an aerial photograph.",10,,
92,0.97,512.178,513.379,The property is right down here.,10,,
93,0.97,513.379,518.15,The reason in 2017 was from Lausanne to commercial one with a 30 foot high limit.,10,,
94,0.97,518.15,524.724,They were related to the Affordability program.,10,,
95,0.97,524.724,530.396,"For those of you who are familiar or not familiar, this is not an urban village.",10,,
96,0.97,530.396,542.775,This is not for the purpose of any comprehensive plan designation.,10,,
97,0.97,542.775,543.809,The mustard color is neighborhood commercial.,10,,
98,0.97,543.809,546.512,All of that zoning was absorbed through the MH letter a in 2018.,10,,
99,0.97,546.512,551.751,The Brown zoning over here is Lowrise.,10,,
100,0.97,551.751,556.222,Some of the zones were absent in 2018 through the Mha in the legislation.,10,,
101,0.97,556.222,565.765,We have some landmarks to help you Situate yourself.,10,,
102,0.97,565.765,567.833,What the Cursor is pointing to here is the elementary school.,10,,
103,0.97,567.833,568.634,This is the park.,10,,
104,0.97,568.634,573.873,"For those of you who are familiar with the area, just North is the building which has a variety of restaurants.",10,,
105,0.97,573.873,577.376,This is also there.,10,,
106,0.97,577.376,581.147,That is where we are in the world.,10,,
107,0.97,581.147,587.753,This is developed with one thing go family house.,10,,
108,0.97,587.753,598.064,"As I mentioned, this was found in 2017.",10,,
109,0.97,598.064,606.205,The neighborhood was outside in 2018 through the image limitation legislation.,10,,
110,0.97,606.205,607.606,There is a little information about the Mha.,10,,
111,0.97,607.606,611.344,"The implementation ordinance, it did not affect sites for which there were qualified judicial reasons.",10,,
112,0.97,611.344,637.503,"If somebody had applied for a contract Rezoning, after the Mha framework legislation, after it was passed by counsel but before the implementation, before the bill had occurred, those sites were exempted from Mha.",10,,
113,0.97,637.503,638.504,They were not necessarily restricted.,10,,
114,0.97,638.504,640.306,Mha was applied to the terms of a contract reason.,10,,
115,0.97,640.306,646.012,There was a period of time in which there was a director's rule which guided Mha implementation.,10,,
116,0.97,646.012,648.014,This particular site was Rezoned above the director's zone.,10,,
117,0.97,648.014,648.648,It was in place.,10,,
118,0.97,648.648,651.517,There are a couple of sites in the city that are like this.,10,,
119,0.97,651.517,655.021,Mha was applied to a contract Rezoning.,10,,
120,0.97,655.021,660.826,There has not been a subsequent development.,10,,
121,0.97,660.826,668.134,"As the Councilmember mentioned, this is a slightly different type of quasijudicial action.",10,,
122,0.97,668.134,669.769,"We rarely, but occasionally get contract Rezoning extensions.",10,,
123,0.97,669.769,674.04,Typically a contract Rezoning last for three years.,10,,
124,0.97,674.04,676.942,It is extended when a development proposal is applied to that site.,10,,
125,0.97,676.942,696.162,"Occasionally, an applicant will not find a development partner or will delay development and will seek that extension of a reason that the Council has approved previously.",10,,
126,0.97,696.162,702.501,I think the most recent circumstance in which the Council extended a reason was in 2015 when the Council extended a Rezoned that was granted to the Seattle housing authority.,10,,
127,0.97,702.501,712.678,"Unlike a typical quasijudicial action, the Council does not rely on a recommendation from the hearing Examiner for the contract reason of extensions.",10,,
128,0.97,712.678,735.768,"In some ways, the quasijudicial decisions rely on a recommendation from Sdci and also public comment provided by former parties of record who are notified when the extension is solid.",10,,
129,0.97,738.304,742.108,So what kind of criteria does the Council apply in making a decision on extending a contract reason?,10,,
130,0.97,742.108,744.143,What is the criteria that comes from the Seattle municipal code?,10,,
131,0.97,744.143,745.978,The reason for the extension has to be reasonable.,10,,
132,0.97,745.978,753.652,"Under the circumstances, I think circumstances can be considered here.",10,,
133,0.97,753.652,754.854,These do with implementation citywide.,10,,
134,0.97,754.854,762.828,Another thing to consider is whether the additional time is reasonable and necessary to comply with conditions of approval for the original adopted contract Rezoned.,10,,
135,0.97,762.828,766.265,Your materials have a link to the original Rezoned ordinance.,10,,
136,0.97,766.265,782.948,The only condition of approval for that Rezoned that was perhaps a Nonstandard condition in certain contexts for approvals was implementation of Mha.,10,,
137,0.97,782.948,793.459,The only condition that applies to future development of the site is that development participating in the Mha program.,10,,
138,0.97,793.459,794.927,"So, you have a recommendation from Sdci.",10,,
139,0.97,794.927,797.229,They looked at the criteria and recommends the extension be approved.,10,,
140,0.97,797.229,803.769,"Today, the Council will hear public comments from parties of record on the Rezone extension.",10,,
141,0.97,803.769,812.578,"And, you have a draft bill in your packet.",10,,
142,0.97,812.578,814.413,This is if the committee chooses to extend the Rezone.,10,,
143,0.97,814.413,816.081,That bill will be introduced during the break.,10,,
144,0.97,816.081,818.684,It will be available for can committee consideration on the 14th.,10,,
145,0.97,818.684,828.06,"Unless you have any questions, I think we can focus on cometary.",10,,
146,0.97,828.06,828.427,Thank you.,11,,
147,0.97,828.427,829.662,I do have a couple questions.,11,,
148,0.97,829.662,833.299,I would just look to my colleagues to see if anybody else has questions at this time.,11,,
149,0.97,833.299,851.35,"Seeing none, thank you for reminding us of the adjacent zoning . How does the 30 foot height limit of this contract compared directly to the surrounding height limits with Mhn now adopted.",11,,
150,0.97,851.35,853.752,"Is it higher, lower, what is the difference between the surrounding zoning?",11,,
151,0.97,853.752,854.22,Yes.,12,,
152,0.97,854.22,855.02,That is a good question.,12,,
153,0.97,855.02,856.622,Thank you for that.,12,,
154,0.97,856.622,871.136,"With Mha implementation, all of the commercial and multifamily zones have increased in height and density associated with them.",12,,
155,0.97,871.136,872.871,"So, I can share the screen again perhaps.",12,,
156,0.97,872.871,878.444,Let me make it a little bit better.,12,,
157,0.97,878.444,879.578,Am I preparing my screen?,12,,
158,0.97,879.578,880.846,I cannot see it very well.,12,,
159,0.97,880.846,884.049,Let me share my screen again here with you all.,12,,
160,0.97,884.049,895.127,"So, the mustard color commercial area has had a height increase from 30 feet to 40 feet for implementation.",13,,
161,0.97,895.127,909.241,The Brown area which is multifamily has seen an increase in height from 30 to about 40 feet through Mha implementation.,13,,
162,0.97,909.241,910.676,There is also a letter far increase as well.,13,,
163,0.97,910.676,926.625,The subject site was a literally Lowrise two . The contract Rezoned to a commercial Rezoned designation.,13,,
164,0.97,926.625,927.726,This was under commercial 130.,13,,
165,0.97,927.726,928.794,This was within a Mha suffix.,13,,
166,0.97,928.794,932.197,"If the extension is not granted, the underlying zoning would not actually be the Lowrise two zoning.",13,,
167,0.97,932.197,935.2,This would not be granted through the MH letter per program.,13,,
168,0.97,935.2,941.807,It would be granted without a suffix and without a concurrent height which increases and goes along with it.,13,,
169,0.97,941.807,946.845,The height could be developed on this site.,13,,
170,0.97,946.845,948.213,This is if the reason were to lapse.,13,,
171,0.97,948.213,968.967,It would be 30 feet and the far would be lower than the adjacent . It would be available for a Lowrise development regarding a multifamily zone across the street.,13,,
172,0.97,968.967,971.036,It would be a 1.1 far as opposed to 1.4.,13,,
173,0.97,971.036,971.77,So thank you.,14,,
174,0.97,971.77,982.181,"What I heard you say is it would be the same height, the SAR would be different.",14,,
175,0.97,982.181,984.049,It would not be within the Mha program.,14,,
176,0.97,984.049,985.05,Is that a correct understanding?,14,,
177,0.97,985.05,985.451,"Yes, correct.",15,,
178,0.97,985.451,989.855,"I mean, another key aspect of the reason that was sought in 2017 is a change from multifamily to commercial zoning.",15,,
179,0.97,989.855,1005.137,So what that allows as well is development of commercial uses of the ground floor and what one might see in his own like this.,15,,
180,0.97,1007.039,1007.573,Thank you.,16,,
181,0.97,1007.573,1012.077,And am I correct that it is unusual to see a contract reason Applicaion out of and associated development proposal Úfor this site?,16,,
182,0.97,1012.077,1013.879,This might be a better question for the applicants.,16,,
183,0.97,1013.879,1014.88,I can answer that.,17,,
184,0.97,1014.88,1015.714,It is not unusual.,17,,
185,0.97,1015.714,1017.516,A typical Rezoned application includes a development proposal.,17,,
186,0.97,1017.516,1018.117,It is not required.,17,,
187,0.97,1018.117,1022.588,Most contract reasons have a development proposal associated with them.,17,,
188,0.97,1022.588,1029.294,Somebody who is applying for a permit at the same time could apply for a contract Rezone.,17,,
189,0.97,1029.294,1030.329,It is not required.,17,,
190,0.97,1030.329,1046.245,"I am just Hazarding a guess, about 10% of the contract Rezone applications do not have an associated development project.",17,,
191,0.97,1046.245,1050.783,"With Mha implementation, there was only one property that did not also have a concurrent permit with the contract reason application.",17,,
192,0.97,1050.783,1058.557,I believe that was a property near Northgate mall.,17,,
193,0.97,1058.557,1059.825,It was controlled by most properties.,17,,
194,0.97,1059.825,1060.192,Thank you.,18,,
195,0.97,1060.192,1062.361,At what point with this existing contract expire?,18,,
196,0.97,1062.361,1074.673,"So, they have, the applicants applied within a time period that is specified in the code for extending the reason.",19,,
197,0.97,1074.673,1084.149,"I believe that had they not made the application within that time period, the Rezone would have already expired.",19,,
198,0.97,1084.149,1086.385,"Because they made that application, they kept it alive.",19,,
199,0.97,1086.385,1087.352,Thank you.,20,,
200,0.97,1087.352,1091.19,That has been the total of my questions.,20,,

206,0.97,1114.246,1114.813,Right.,22,,
207,0.97,1114.813,1118.083,Have we heard any feedback Rom her office as to whether she is okay with this?,23,,

219,0.97,1190.789,1200.766,"If you have comments about something that is not pertinent to this, you can always provide written comments by Emailing my office.",26,,

242,0.97,1313.779,1315.08,I am a resident of the area.,33,,
243,0.97,1315.08,1317.783,This has been since 1978.,33,,
244,0.97,1317.783,1321.987,I am a strong advocate for neighborhood business districts.,33,,
245,0.97,1321.987,1326.491,I deal with zoning.,33,,
246,0.97,1326.491,1335.067,Nz zoning really assist society in helping alleviate climate change.,33,,
247,0.97,1335.067,1349.815,This is because it puts neighborhood businesses close to residential areas in order to eliminate the need or minimize the need for people to drive to to their purchasing.,33,,
248,0.97,1349.815,1359.424,Our company is a small family run business that we established in 1978.,33,,
249,0.97,1359.424,1366.965,We started building townhouses and won numerous awards for our Townhouse structures.,33,,
250,0.97,1366.965,1374.439,This is including the first design review Townhouse project long ago.,33,,
251,0.97,1374.439,1383.548,I wanted to just mention that Abby is representing us.,33,,
252,0.97,1383.548,1387.652,This is a very complicated thing.,33,,
253,0.97,1387.652,1395.961,"It is not easily you know, Decipherable.",33,,
254,0.97,1395.961,1396.962,And Abby has set me straight.,33,,
255,0.97,1396.962,1398.597,"Originally, I was representing myself.",33,,
256,0.97,1398.597,1416.681,I myself did some mistakes . I tried to bring to the attention of the Council that this site is an anomaly and should have been similar to the other sites adjacent to it.,33,,
257,0.97,1416.681,1420.919,It was processed in a complicated way.,33,,
258,0.97,1420.919,1443.975,"So rather than tracking the original intent to make it like the other business districts sites, zoning -Wise, it was converted to this contract Rezone.",33,,
259,0.97,1445.577,1446.711,I was on mute.,34,,
260,0.97,1446.711,1449.347,"Marty, we have reached the expiration of your two minutes plus the additional time.",34,,
261,0.97,1449.347,1459.524,Thank you for those thoughts . I know that Abby is coming up in just a moment.,34,,

267,0.97,1471.536,1472.537,"There we are, good morning.",35,,
268,0.97,1472.537,1481.179,Good morning Council members.,36,,
269,0.97,1481.179,1482.247,Thank you for this opportunity.,36,,
270,0.97,1482.247,1484.082,I am calling in support of this extension.,36,,
271,0.97,1484.082,1488.553,This is regarding 314461.,36,,
272,0.97,1488.553,1490.388,I think what Marty said is right on.,36,,
273,0.97,1490.388,1505.67,I think neighborhood businesses and Multiuse land is really important.,36,,
274,0.97,1505.67,1510.909,"You know, this is so people do not have to travel far and wide to get what they need in order to live a good life.",36,,
275,0.97,1510.909,1512.911,"So, I am totally in support of this Rezone.",36,,
276,0.97,1512.911,1513.378,Thank you.,37,,
277,0.97,1513.378,1517.282,Anything else to share?,37,,
278,0.97,1517.282,1530.428,"I see via, I see that she has muted herself.",37,,
279,0.97,1530.428,1531.029,Lost his Abigail.,37,,
280,0.97,1531.029,1531.63,"Abigail, welcome.",37,,
281,0.97,1531.63,1531.997,Good morning.,37,,
282,0.97,1531.997,1541.006,"Hello, good morning committee members.",38,,
283,0.97,1541.006,1541.606,My name is Abigail.,38,,
284,0.97,1541.606,1544.843,I am speaking on behalf of the applicant Marty Leibowiz for counsel file 314461.,38,,
285,0.97,1544.843,1547.312,This is regarding the Rezoned extension.,38,,
286,0.97,1547.312,1552.584,I am an attorney with a local firm.,38,,
287,0.97,1552.584,1560.859,"First, we just wanted to thank counsel central staff for their work on this Rezone extension.",38,,
288,0.97,1560.859,1570.635,I think they have done a great job getting an overview of what we are asking for today.,38,,
289,0.97,1570.635,1584.649,We really hope that the city council will support the Rezone extension so that Marty has a chance to develop this property consistent with adjacent zoning.,38,,
290,0.97,1584.649,1592.123,"Councilmember Dan Strauss, you had a great question earlier regarding what the extension really does.",38,,
291,0.97,1592.123,1593.291,I think that is really important.,38,,
292,0.97,1593.291,1600.098,"As was pointed out, the height limit is not going to be different.",38,,
293,0.97,1600.098,1611.81,It will not be different under this Mc letter three zoning.,38,,
294,0.97,1615.38,1616.381,It is an issue of consistency.,38,,
295,0.97,1616.381,1620.752,It is an issue of consistency with a portion of the site falling under the Mha 14 with neighborhood commercial zoning.,38,,
296,0.97,1620.752,1622.687,"And then, this will also be neighborhood commercial zoning.",38,,
297,0.97,1622.687,1627.592,It would be really really hard to qualify this in the future if there is a split sewn condition between Lowrise and neighborhood commercial zoning.,38,,
298,0.97,1627.592,1629.928,That is what is unique about the situation.,38,,
299,0.97,1629.928,1641.539,We think that the circumstances surrounding Covid-19 and Marty has been searching for a development partner to develop this site.,38,,
300,0.97,1641.539,1644.409,"Because of Covid-19 and the economic conditions, that really has not happened yet.",38,,
301,0.97,1644.409,1645.143,It absolutely hopes to.,38,,
302,0.97,1645.143,1646.811,Thank you so much for your consideration.,38,,
303,0.97,1646.811,1656.554,Thank you Abigail.,39,,
304,0.97,1656.554,1665.73,"Seeking no further speakers, and that was our last Speaker remotely present to speak at this public hearing, the public hearing in it, Eric, can you confirm no further speakers?",39,,
305,0.97,1665.73,1667.332,"That is correct, no further speakers.",40,,
306,0.97,1667.332,1677.876,", that was our last Speaker.",41,,
307,0.97,1682.213,1683.948,The Council hearing on 314461 is now closed.,41,,

309,0.97,1685.383,1689.054,"Unless there is any further discussion, this will be back before the Committee on Wednesday, January 13, 2021.",41,,
310,0.97,1689.054,1691.156,This will be for a possible vote.,41,,
311,0.97,1691.156,1697.862,"I see Councilmember Alex Pedersen, take it away.",41,,
312,0.97,1697.862,1698.396,Thank you.,42,,
313,0.97,1698.396,1703.068,"Do we know if any trees are going to be removed, will any trees be removed from this site for the development?",42,,
314,0.97,1703.068,1705.07,"Well, I think, correct me if I am wrong.",43,,
315,0.97,1705.07,1708.573,I think what we heard is that there is not a proposed project at this time.,43,,
316,0.97,1708.573,1714.479,That is correct.,44,,
317,0.97,1714.479,1715.48,That is correct.,45,,
318,0.97,1715.48,1717.082,There is not a permanent application at this time.,45,,
319,0.97,1717.082,1731.329,"How the site will be developed, whether there is significant trees, how they are will be preserved if there are, this is not the information that is available for the extension.",45,,
320,0.97,1731.329,1734.332,And it would be subject to whatever regulations are in place at the time.,45,,
321,0.97,1734.332,1736.401,The applicant will apply for this permit.,45,,
322,0.97,1736.401,1738.903,Hopefully we will have our tree ordinance before that happens.,46,,
323,0.97,1738.903,1739.204,Thank you.,46,,

363,0.97,1967.332,1971.703,"We also shared links to elicit public input through the urban forestry Commission Bulletin, the trees for Seattle newsletter.",52,,
364,0.97,1971.703,1973.037,We also used a different newsletter as well.,52,,
365,0.97,1973.037,1990.054,"Just to give you a sense of the range of outreach that we did, through the Encasement phase one, we asked participants whether they wanted to remain involved in the process and provide input once the draft plan was ready.",52,,
366,0.97,1990.054,1995.393,We gathered 90 residents that were interested.,52,,
367,0.97,1995.393,2003.868,We also shared all of these documents and requested input from the 650 members of the urban forestry Commission bulletin.,52,,
368,0.97,2003.868,2014.612,We reached out to roughly another 120 participants from listening sessions.,52,,
369,0.97,2014.612,2022.186,"This was including tree advocates, and notation profits like organizations that we work with.",52,,
370,0.97,2022.186,2026.824,This deals with government agencies and tree service providers.,52,,
371,0.97,2026.824,2029.494,We received 165 responses to the Online comment form.,52,,
372,0.97,2029.494,2036.2,89 of such responses included pretty detailed feedback.,52,,
373,0.97,2036.2,2046.144,Staff also received 11 direct Emails with letters Commenting on the draft plan.,52,,
374,0.97,2046.144,2047.612,We have our work cut out for us.,52,,
375,0.97,2047.612,2063.895,"We are very excited that we received such robust responses and the team is currently reviewing and discussing input received in determining you know, like we are going to be creating a summary.",52,,
376,0.97,2063.895,2065.83,We are going to be creating a series of themes.,52,,
377,0.97,2065.83,2070.201,We are certainly seeing a theory and a series of themes as we are reviewing public comment.,52,,
378,0.97,2070.201,2082.48,We are going to be incorporating public comment into the new draft of the plan.,52,,
379,0.97,2091.923,2095.126,"In terms of next steps, we are going to be doing all of this review in December.",52,,
380,0.97,2095.126,2098.029,We plan to incorporate into the plan and produce a new draft in January.,52,,
381,0.97,2098.029,2100.565,Then we will submit it to the Mayor's office for a true rule.,52,,
382,0.97,2100.565,2102.4,"Once approved, the plan will undergo a review.",52,,
383,0.97,2102.4,2103.401,Aa determination will be issued.,52,,
384,0.97,2103.401,2106.07,The team expects to share the plan formally with counsel in the spring.,52,,
385,0.97,2106.07,2117.882,I do not know if you have any questions at this point or if we want to wait until we finish discussing the tree regulations.,52,,
386,0.97,2117.882,2119.283,"So, would you mind?",52,,
387,0.97,2119.283,2121.285,"Yes, I do not see any questions at this mine.",53,,
388,0.97,2121.285,2122.62,Let's hear from the next Speaker.,53,,
389,0.97,2122.62,2123.788,Thank you Sondra.,53,,
390,0.97,2123.788,2125.99,Good morning.,54,,
391,0.97,2125.99,2136.3,Thank you Sandra.,54,,
392,0.97,2137.001,2141.305,Sdci and Osc and its partners have been working to improve tree protection and explore strategies as outlined in resolution 31902.,54,,
393,0.97,2141.305,2147.111,We take this task seriously and we have undertaken work on a number of fronts.,54,,
394,0.97,2147.111,2161.125,"As you know, the proposed draft direct or's rule 13 dash 2020 received over 800 public comments.",54,,
395,0.97,2161.125,2163.794,This was this summer with the vast majority in support of increased tree protections.,54,,
396,0.97,2163.794,2177.675,"And then, many of those comments that we received asked us to go further with code updates.",54,,
397,0.97,2182.914,2186.484,Sdci is in the process of reviewing and responding to Stakeholder comments on the proposed draft at this time.,54,,
398,0.97,2186.484,2190.555,"As far as tree mapping, Sdci is working with other city departments to acquire updated tree canopy data in 2021.",54,,
399,0.97,2190.555,2193.19,This will show us the extent and distribution of trees across the city.,54,,
400,0.97,2193.19,2195.459,This project is a 3-D aerial Scan of the air service.,54,,
401,0.97,2195.459,2200.097,It has many applications including the measurement of tree canopy.,54,,
402,0.97,2200.097,2208.472,"We are anticipating that with the city's commitment to this project, the Department of natural resources will be successful in the next step to win the Federal grant that will allow this key project to move forward next year.",54,,
403,0.97,2208.472,2217.381,We have continued to improve permit review coordination.,54,,
404,0.97,2217.381,2218.015,We have two Arborists.,54,,
405,0.97,2218.015,2235.933,They are assisting in the permit review including giving us advice on code enforcement cases.,54,,
406,0.97,2235.933,2241.706,"As far as education and information updates, early next year, Sdci will be reaching out to local companies with updated information about tree protection regulations and best practices.",54,,
407,0.97,2241.706,2243.24,This includes the upcoming Sdci virtual Pallbearers.,54,,
408,0.97,2243.24,2263.928,"This will help people learn about the existing tree codes concerning what you need to know about protecting trees, what tree removal limits are and how you can protect trees when remodeling your home as Paddling a detached unit.",54,,
409,0.97,2263.928,2267.331,"For tree tracking and removal replacement, we are being very Data-Driven in our approach.",54,,
410,0.97,2267.331,2283.614,Sdci analyst continue to capture tree related information from approved construction permit applications going back to July of 2019.,54,,
411,0.97,2290.354,2294.158,We plan to use that information to guide and inform us on approaches to increase protections for trees.,54,,
412,0.97,2294.158,2296.594,We are using that collected data to monitor the status of these trees.,54,,
413,0.97,2296.594,2299.764,"This is whether the trees are existing, preserved, and or replanted as part of mitigation.",54,,
414,0.97,2299.764,2301.399,This allows staff to make adjustments as needed.,54,,
415,0.97,2301.399,2304.669,"Right now, we have been working in partnership with the office of Sustainability and environment.",54,,
416,0.97,2304.669,2305.97,We evaluate the strategies identified in resolution 31902.,54,,
417,0.97,2305.97,2312.677,This is using a racial equity loans.,54,,
418,0.97,2312.677,2320.184,"Right now, the staff is considering whether any additional or alternative strategies might be better suited to address environmental disparities.",54,,
419,0.97,2320.184,2337.268,We know that there are neighborhoods in Seattle that have a lower percentage of tree canopy coverage . We are taking the time necessary to carefully evaluate the strategies identified in the resolution.,54,,
420,0.97,2337.268,2338.836,This is through the racial equity loans.,54,,
421,0.97,2338.836,2341.906,We can address the disparities as one of our guiding principles for any changes going forward.,54,,
422,0.97,2341.906,2356.12,"As far as next steps, our future work will involve a tailored public outreach effort to reach residents who live in low income and low canopy neighborhoods.",54,,
423,0.97,2356.12,2359.056,We look forward to working with you over the next several weeks and months.,54,,
424,0.97,2359.056,2364.662,This is as we begin to prepare what this public outreach plan will look like.,54,,
425,0.97,2364.662,2366.864,It will deal with what it will include 420 21.,54,,
426,0.97,2366.864,2374.138,I could say that it will certainly be a robust plan that moves us forward with an approach rooted in environmental justice.,54,,
427,0.97,2374.138,2375.373,That really concludes our briefing today.,54,,
428,0.97,2375.373,2378.175,We are happy to answer any questions that you have at this time.,54,,
429,0.97,2378.175,2378.843,Thank you.,55,,
430,0.97,2378.843,2379.276,Thank you Mike.,55,,
431,0.97,2379.276,2383.748,Thank you Sondra.,55,,
432,0.97,2383.748,2390.054,Your memo that is attached to the agenda today is very helpful.,55,,
433,0.97,2390.054,2392.223,"We ask that in the future, please have the Powerpoint presentation.",55,,
434,0.97,2392.223,2411.575,I incorrectly made the assumption and that is on me for making the assumption that we would have a Powerpoint today within the memo.,55,,
435,0.97,2411.575,2415.713,"Under progress, on the urban forest management plan update, the Webinar style presentation, I am signaling this for the viewing public.",55,,
436,0.97,2415.713,2428.592,Sondra has a Video that is posted on the Seattle government's Website.,55,,
437,0.97,2434.165,2436.0,It is going through essentially most of this presentation.,55,,
438,0.97,2436.0,2440.604,"For the viewing public, if you would like to view that, please do open the memo that is attached to the agenda item.",55,,
439,0.97,2440.604,2443.007,"In the third paragraph, click the Hyperlink to the presentation.",55,,
440,0.97,2443.007,2446.143,"Again, departments, I would strongly ask and encourage you to bring these types of presentations forward.",55,,
441,0.97,2446.143,2449.146,We are here in the remote setting.,55,,
442,0.97,2449.146,2454.518,We are just hearing verbal updates.,55,,
443,0.97,2454.518,2461.125,They can be hard to follow along at times.,55,,
444,0.97,2461.125,2462.326,This memo is very comprehensive.,55,,
445,0.97,2462.326,2462.76,I appreciate it.,55,,
446,0.97,2462.76,2468.833,I just wanted to signal that for our friends at Sdci and Osc.,55,,
447,0.97,2468.833,2470.0,I have a couple small questions.,55,,
448,0.97,2470.0,2477.775,I would like to check to see if any of you have questions.,55,,
449,0.97,2477.775,2479.043,"Councilmember Alex Pedersen, take it away.",55,,
450,0.97,2479.043,2490.154,Thank you chair Dan Strauss.,56,,
451,0.97,2490.154,2491.922,I am sorry if you already said this.,56,,
452,0.97,2491.922,2493.858,When will we be getting the tree ordinance to review?,56,,
453,0.97,2493.858,2497.494,Is there a revised estimate of that?,56,,
454,0.97,2497.494,2500.664,It is not the exact day.,56,,
455,0.97,2500.664,2507.471,"Yes, thank you for that question Councilmember.",57,,
456,0.97,2507.471,2516.28,"As was mentioned, we are planning to do this equity analysis of the strategies that are contained in the resolution.",57,,
457,0.97,2516.28,2540.838,Those really will drive the recommendations for code updates.,57,,
458,0.97,2540.838,2542.006,We cannot say for sure.,57,,
459,0.97,2542.006,2544.808,"Now with the results of that, we do not know what the results would be.",57,,
460,0.97,2544.808,2551.548,We will be talking with the Mayor's office in the next couple weeks about our strategy moving forward with public outreach as well as equity analysis and the formulation of recommendations.,57,,
461,0.97,2551.548,2555.619,We are hoping that we will have more to share with you about the schedule as part of the fourth quarter report.,57,,
462,0.97,2555.619,2556.82,More information is coming soon.,57,,
463,0.97,2556.82,2559.223,I know that you are very interested in the tree code updates.,57,,
464,0.97,2559.223,2561.058,We are working hard to help you with that.,57,,
465,0.97,2561.058,2561.458,Thank you.,58,,
466,0.97,2561.458,2562.927,"Councilmember Alex Pedersen, I appreciate you.",59,,
467,0.97,2562.927,2564.328,I will share this with you.,59,,
468,0.97,2564.328,2565.362,I have mine here as well.,59,,
469,0.97,2565.362,2571.702,"This year, we have this resolution that I helped the staff to create, outlining our steps.",59,,
470,0.97,2571.702,2573.804,"As we all know, this year was unexpected.",59,,
471,0.97,2573.804,2586.25,"Those Timelines, I have found them to be unique.",59,,
472,0.97,2586.25,2587.818,This year is all about remaining flexible.,59,,
473,0.97,2587.818,2591.789,"In Sondra's Video presentation that is on the Seattle government's Website, there is a next steps Timeline.",59,,
474,0.97,2591.789,2593.557,It is towards the end of the presentation.,59,,
475,0.97,2593.557,2598.262,"Again, I just hesitate.",59,,
476,0.97,2598.262,2614.912,We are tying this down too hard and fast numbers and dates and times . This deals with all of the different changes.,59,,
477,0.97,2614.912,2617.381,It deals with the need to Prioritize and focus on important issues.,59,,
478,0.97,2617.381,2619.183,This has disrupted everything as everybody already knows.,59,,
479,0.97,2619.183,2623.12,My only question here is what are some of the uses of the data we received from the project?,59,,
480,0.97,2623.12,2625.089,How does it compare to the past survey that was conducted?,59,,
481,0.97,2625.089,2626.89,I will be happy to answer that.,60,,
482,0.97,2626.89,2637.434,"So, this is a technology that sends laser impulses.",60,,
483,0.97,2637.434,2644.541,"And then, as they come back, they can register to help us create very detailed mapping.",60,,
484,0.97,2644.541,2675.239,"There are quite a few city departments that use the data for a multitude of uses including geographic land use, geological purposes . I believe that the municipality has used Lidar to try to plan ahead of landslides like what happened with Oso.",60,,
485,0.97,2675.239,2685.449,"In our case, we used Lidar for mapping the canopy.",60,,
486,0.97,2685.449,2687.117,I am not going to get too technical.,60,,
487,0.97,2687.117,2689.053,"Actually, I do not understand a whole lot of it.",60,,
488,0.97,2689.053,2693.891,I just want to provide a framework for what I am going to say.,60,,
489,0.97,2693.891,2699.797,"You can do Lidar, Levon.",60,,
490,0.97,2699.797,2701.665,This means that you do it for the summer.,60,,
491,0.97,2701.665,2715.079,This is regarding when the tree leaves are on the trees.,60,,
492,0.97,2715.079,2716.747,That only has use for urban forestry.,60,,
493,0.97,2716.747,2727.424,"Because a majority of the uses require leaf off which is acquiring the data either in the spring when, excuse me, or in the fall when there is no leaves on the trees.",60,,
494,0.97,2727.424,2731.695,We had to acquire leaf off data.,60,,
495,0.97,2731.695,2734.731,"And then, we had to follow a protocol well established by the U.S. Forest service.",60,,
496,0.97,2734.731,2747.311,That means that we have to pair it up with satellite imagery.,60,,
497,0.97,2747.311,2750.214,"In that way, the Lidar information is kind of like a census of trees.",60,,
498,0.97,2750.214,2754.518,It has a plus or minus margin of error.,60,,
499,0.97,2754.518,2755.452,This is the most accurate.,60,,
500,0.97,2755.452,2769.5,"Then, we pair it with a satellite imagery that brings in the lease on color of the trees.",60,,
501,0.97,2771.335,2773.337,"Anyway, that is as technical as I am going to get.",60,,
502,0.97,2773.337,2782.88,One of the things that we wanted to do with the 2016 Lidar project was to be able to use this same technology that we used at the very beginning when we created the first plan.,60,,
503,0.97,2782.88,2786.35,We created that 2007 plan by doing an analysis of Lidar information.,60,,
504,0.97,2786.35,2804.401,"We wanted to create a trend, to figure out what the trend, the canopy cover change over time is for Seattle.",60,,
505,0.97,2804.401,2808.872,This is so that we could really tailor the work that we do in our actions and strategies and policies accordingly.,60,,
506,0.97,2808.872,2811.909,"Unfortunately, we were not able to do a comparison.",60,,
507,0.97,2811.909,2814.111,"When they consulted, we looked at the 2001 data.",60,,
508,0.97,2814.111,2822.886,"That was the highest, you know, that was the best way to measure at the time.",60,,
509,0.97,2822.886,2834.698,They realized that that date at did not have enough resolution for it to be meaningful in terms of comparison.,60,,
510,0.97,2834.698,2840.404,"They explained to Osc and the core team, we can spend all of your money trying to clean up that data.",60,,
511,0.97,2840.404,2850.714,We would recommend that you consider 2016 your baseline.,60,,
512,0.97,2850.714,2863.527,We are participating in a multi- Department team that is looking into the possibility of acquiring Lidar data that next year.,60,,
513,0.97,2863.527,2866.163,We are applying for a grant to hopefully be able to do that.,60,,
514,0.97,2866.163,2869.433,"Again, the way I try to explain this to people is technology changes.",60,,
515,0.97,2869.433,2885.882,"We cannot, do you remember the PDA?",60,,
516,0.97,2885.882,2888.151,They were the palm pilots that were so wonderful at the time.,60,,
517,0.97,2888.151,2890.988,We C█Annot blame a pilot for no being able to stream Video today.,60,,
518,0.97,2890.988,2891.755,This is different technology.,60,,
519,0.97,2891.755,2893.59,This is technology that can be used to improve things.,60,,
520,0.97,2893.59,2899.663,"Our intention is that when we do the next assessment, we will continue to use the same technology and protocol that will allow us to compare apples to apples.",60,,
521,0.97,2899.663,2900.898,I hope that answers your question.,60,,
522,0.97,2900.898,2901.298,That does.,61,,
523,0.97,2901.298,2902.499,That is very helpful.,61,,
524,0.97,2902.499,2904.468,I am looking up your presentation on my blackberry now.,61,,
525,0.97,2904.468,2905.502,"Unfortunately, that is not possible.",61,,
526,0.97,2905.502,2915.779,[Laughter],62,,
527,0.97,2925.756,2926.69,I appreciate that review.,63,,
528,0.97,2926.69,2928.325,"Colleagues, any further questions on this tree update?",63,,
529,0.97,2928.325,2936.066,"I know that because of the amended schedule for this year, we would have had many more updates and I wanted to make sure that we had one last one in their before the end of the year.",63,,
530,0.97,2936.066,2938.101,We will have more updates next year as well.,63,,
531,0.97,2938.101,2939.703,"Seeing no more questions, I thank you all.",63,,
532,0.97,2939.703,2941.505,Thank you for joining us today to provide this update.,63,,
533,0.97,2941.505,2945.008,I am glad we will be working with all of you to advance these tree protections.,63,,
534,0.97,2945.008,2947.811,We will bring a new tree ordinance to the counselor as soon as possible.,63,,
535,0.97,2947.811,2948.211,Thank you all.,63,,
536,0.97,2948.211,2955.152,Thank you.,64,,
537,0.97,2955.152,2958.522,Our final item of business today is a briefing discussion on the interim Floodplain regulations.,65,,
538,0.97,2958.522,2960.223,Will you please read this item into the record?,65,,
539,0.97,2960.223,2962.225,This is the extension of interim Floodplain regulations.,66,,
540,0.97,2962.225,2963.427,Thank you.,67,,
541,0.97,2963.427,2973.57,We are joined by various individuals.,67,,
542,0.97,2973.57,2975.439,"Before we begin, I have a note on the process.",67,,
543,0.97,2975.439,2978.508,We have not introduced legislation to adopt the legislation that we are discussing today.,67,,
544,0.97,2978.508,3000.263,We plan to have the legislation introduced next week to allow for a public hearing and consideration in January.,67,,
545,0.97,3000.263,3005.702,"Given that we have a tight Timeline to meet and adopt this legislation, we are holding a preliminary briefing so that we can quickly act in January.",67,,
546,0.97,3005.702,3007.904,Typically I like to have two meetings before passing legislation.,67,,
547,0.97,3007.904,3009.973,This is why we are having a short briefing today.,67,,
548,0.97,3009.973,3010.307,Thank you.,67,,
549,0.97,3010.307,3011.007,Please take it away.,67,,
550,0.97,3011.007,3014.544,I will just say a couple of words to remind the Councilmembers about the legislative history.,68,,
551,0.97,3014.544,3019.216,Then I will turn it over to Maggie to talk about the legislation that will be introduced shortly and what it would do.,68,,
552,0.97,3019.216,3030.527,"So, as the committee will recall, back in July, the council passed ordinance 22 6113.",68,,
553,0.97,3030.527,3034.398,That ordinance adopted interim Floodplain regulations so that the city could continue to participate in the flood insurance program.,68,,
554,0.97,3034.398,3035.832,Those interim regulations will expire in February.,68,,
555,0.97,3035.832,3043.707,The committee and Council will be considering an extension of those interim regulations in January.,68,,
556,0.97,3043.707,3047.31,I will turn it over to Maggie to talk about what the extension can do.,68,,
557,0.97,3047.31,3053.05,Good morning thank you for having me here today.,69,,
558,0.97,3053.05,3054.851,I am going to share my screen with you.,69,,
559,0.97,3054.851,3068.365,I do have a Powerpoint presentation that walks us through the information.,69,,
560,0.97,3070.801,3073.336,"So, I will be talking about the interim Floodplain development regulations extension.",69,,
561,0.97,3073.336,3095.058,I will cover an overview of the regulations and a reason for the extension as well as the public outreach that we have conducted to date and the next steps that we anticipate.,69,,
562,0.97,3095.058,3109.005,"So as was mentioned, in July 2020, the city council passed and the Mayor signed ordinance 126113.",69,,
563,0.97,3117.28,3118.782,It established interim Floodplain development regulations.,69,,
564,0.97,3118.782,3122.285,"These regulations contain building codes as well as other standards that make homes, businesses, and people safer from flooding.",69,,
565,0.97,3122.285,3126.59,They apply to the permit applications for construction on property within mapped Floodplain areas.,69,,
566,0.97,3126.59,3137.434,"So, the Federal Emergency Management agency, also known as FEMA produced the updated maps that we adopted in the interim regulations.",69,,
567,0.97,3137.434,3140.604,They also establish the minimum required standards for those regulations.,69,,
568,0.97,3140.604,3144.107,These regulations are due to expire February 24 of 2021.,69,,
569,0.97,3144.107,3170.233,"And if these interim regulations are not extended, the property owners in the FEMA Floodplain areas may not be able to purchase flood insurance or renew any existing policies.",69,,
570,0.97,3170.233,3176.339,So the reason for the extension is that we need additional time to evaluate the properties that are not mapped by FEMA but are mapped by Spu as flood prone.,69,,
571,0.97,3176.339,3188.985,This will determine if additional areas need to be included in the regulations.,69,,
572,0.97,3188.985,3201.965,"Also, the public outreach and environmental review for the permanent regulations have taken longer than we anticipated.",69,,
573,0.97,3201.965,3206.236,So here is an example of an area that is mapped by Spu as flood prone but not mapped by FEMA.,69,,
574,0.97,3206.236,3221.418,This is an area in the South Park neighborhood . We would like to evaluate areas such as these in order to determine if we are going to adopt these additional areas that then would be regulated under the Floodplain regulations.,69,,
575,0.97,3221.418,3245.208,"So to date, the public outrage that we contacted is that we have a project Webpage up and running with information about both the interim regulations and the anticipated permanent regulations for the Floodplain.",69,,
576,0.97,3245.208,3262.759,"And, we also have a sign up, we have an area to sign up for people to be included in our Email list for any public meetings that we do as well as any additional information.",69,,
577,0.97,3262.759,3276.873,"So, prior to establishing the project Webpage, we sent out 2400 postcards to owners of property in the web plane areas letting them know that they are mapped as Floodplain areas and to direct them to our Webpage for additional information and to sign up to be on our Email list.",69,,
578,0.97,3276.873,3290.72,"As of now, we have 160 sip subscribers to our Email list for the Floodplain development regulation.",69,,
579,0.97,3294.424,3296.393,"For the next steps, we will continue on public outreach.",69,,
580,0.97,3296.393,3299.763,We will work with staff to evaluate if additional areas should be included as flood prone.,69,,
581,0.97,3299.763,3304.501,And we will work on developing the permanent regulations.,69,,
582,0.97,3304.501,3309.973,"If you have questions, I can take those now.",69,,
583,0.97,3309.973,3319.916,Thank you Maggie.,70,,
584,0.97,3319.916,3330.293,I have a few issues.,70,,
585,0.97,3331.361,3332.362,Do we have any questions?,70,,
586,0.97,3332.362,3342.872,Can you tell us about adopting this legislation in January and what the consequences are if we do not have this legislation in January?,70,,
587,0.97,3342.872,3346.076,"Yes, so, because of the delay in the permanent regulations, those interim regulations would expire.",71,,
588,0.97,3346.076,3360.39,That would mean that property owners within the Floodplain mapped areas would not be able to get insurance.,71,,
589,0.97,3360.39,3362.425,"So, let's say a property owner was selling their property.",71,,
590,0.97,3362.425,3369.132,The new owner would need to acquire Floodplain insurance but they would no longer be able to acquire it.,71,,
591,0.97,3369.132,3372.535,"If any of the policies are expiring, they would not be able to renew those policies.",71,,
592,0.97,3372.535,3375.972,That is the main consequence.,71,,
593,0.97,3375.972,3380.677,"Thank you, that is helpful.",72,,
594,0.97,3380.677,3401.998,"As we had this legislation before as earlier this year, are there any changes in this legislation other than extending the interim regulations as compared to what we already adopted earlier this year.",72,,
595,0.97,3401.998,3405.301,"With the extension of the interim regulations, that is limited to the interim regulations.",73,,
596,0.97,3405.301,3406.936,There would be no additional regulations added on.,73,,
597,0.97,3406.936,3410.106,"Great, thank you for that, that is helpful.",74,,
598,0.97,3410.106,3415.178,Can you share a little bit about why it is taking longer to adopt regulations?,75,,
599,0.97,3415.178,3428.391,So one of the reasons is Covid-19 and everything is taking more time.,76,,
600,0.97,3428.391,3429.926,"You know, there is the public outreach.",76,,
601,0.97,3429.926,3446.91,"Also, regarding the public outreach, you know, we are basically, we did not have a list serve with identified property owners in the Floodplain areas.",76,,
602,0.97,3446.91,3448.611,We needed to do a bit of Legwork.,76,,
603,0.97,3448.611,3452.415,We worked with the office of economic development in order to get information on property owners in a particular area.,76,,
604,0.97,3452.415,3454.617,We did outreach there as well as mailing out the postcards.,76,,
605,0.97,3454.617,3456.853,We gave time for the postcards to get to everyone.,76,,
606,0.97,3456.853,3459.322,We directed them to our Website in order to build a list serve.,76,,
607,0.97,3459.322,3467.63,"Another main reason is that so, there are areas that are mapped by Fpu as Floodplain areas.",76,,
608,0.97,3467.63,3470.633,They are not mapped by FEMA.,76,,
609,0.97,3470.633,3491.554,"We really want to do our due diligence in order to look at those areas and make sure that we evaluate whether we should bring in more areas to be regulated under the regulations, to ensure safety during floods.",76,,
610,0.97,3491.554,3494.123,"And, you know, there will be additional flooding that we anticipate.",76,,
611,0.97,3494.123,3496.059,There is an immense amount of very technical work.,77,,
612,0.97,3496.059,3503.967,It is incredibly important to how we are going to live as the climate crisis continues.,77,,
613,0.97,3503.967,3513.51,We have a major shift in how we build and move our lives.,77,,
614,0.97,3513.51,3521.618,Have we heard any opposition to these interim regulations as they have already been in place for some time?,77,,
615,0.97,3521.618,3523.686,What are the regulations regarding the property owners in affected areas?,77,,
616,0.97,3523.686,3525.688,We have been working directly with court staff.,78,,
617,0.97,3525.688,3540.403,The court has raised some concerns regarding existing Overwater structures on peers.,78,,
618,0.97,3540.403,3544.274,It deals with what that would mean if they were going to do repair projects or replacement project.,78,,
619,0.97,3544.274,3546.242,"The Pier is already there, it is in a fixed elevation.",78,,
620,0.97,3546.242,3556.819,"How will the regulations impact, if they are going to Redevelop on top of the pier?",78,,
621,0.97,3556.819,3558.621,"And so, we have identified that as an issue.",78,,
622,0.97,3558.621,3563.76,"We are working with staff at FEMA to see how, you know, is other areas have experienced that.",78,,
623,0.97,3563.76,3574.437,And it deals with the best way to address that.,78,,
624,0.97,3574.437,3577.941,"You know, we are working with the port staff as well as FEMA staff on that issue.",78,,
625,0.97,3577.941,3580.71,"And then, we have been doing the public outreach in a particular area.",78,,
626,0.97,3580.71,3587.517,"So far, we have just been walking property owners through how the regulations would impact their properties.",78,,
627,0.97,3587.517,3599.662,"So far, we have not gotten any you know, specific issues that any property owner has raised at this point.",78,,
628,0.97,3599.662,3601.264,We will continue to do the outreach.,78,,
629,0.97,3601.264,3611.874,We will make sure that we identify all of those issues.,78,,
630,0.97,3611.874,3612.475,Thank you.,79,,
631,0.97,3612.475,3618.748,"It sounds like, if there are issues, especially with the court, it appears that we may have the opportunity to address those before the permanent regulations come before the committee.",79,,
632,0.97,3618.748,3622.785,"Exactly, that is the full intent.",80,,
633,0.97,3622.785,3623.186,Thank you.,81,,
634,0.97,3623.186,3629.225,"Councilmember, you asked if the proposed legislation differs from the previous one the regulations are now being changed by the legislation that the Council will consider.",82,,
635,0.97,3629.225,3642.105,"One difference is the length of the interim regulations, the length of time during which the interim regulations will be in place will be longer than six months.",82,,
636,0.97,3642.105,3644.14,This will be longer than the current interim regulations.,82,,
637,0.97,3644.14,3662.625,The bill the Council will consider will provide for a year-long extension to get Sdci and the Council initial time to consider interventions.,82,,
638,0.97,3662.625,3664.627,Thank you for noting that and for the viewing public.,83,,
639,0.97,3664.627,3666.663,That was a request that was made by me.,83,,
640,0.97,3666.663,3670.133,This was so that we did not have to continue extending interim regulations as we understand it.,83,,
641,0.97,3670.133,3675.638,"Some of this outreach, because it is so detailed and technical, it could take longer.",83,,
642,0.97,3675.638,3688.718,"Rather than continuing to extend interim measures, I wanted to provide a more robust amount of time.",83,,
643,0.97,3689.519,3690.053,Any other questions?,83,,
644,0.97,3690.053,3692.121,"I see Councilmember Peterson, there is nothing over there, great.",83,,
645,0.97,3692.121,3692.355,Maggie.,83,,
646,0.97,3692.355,3693.656,"Excellent work, thank you so much.",83,,
647,0.97,3693.656,3694.557,Thank you.,84,,
648,0.97,3694.557,3700.196,"Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda, I see no questions.",85,,
649,0.97,3700.196,3700.997,No questions.,86,,
650,0.97,3700.997,3701.33,Thank you.,86,,
651,0.97,3701.33,3708.704,"So if we have no further questions, there is nothing, you are good, thumbs up.",87,,
652,0.97,3708.704,3709.372,Thank you all.,87,,
653,0.97,3709.372,3712.175,"As I stated, I like to usually have two meetings on items.",87,,
654,0.97,3712.175,3727.824,"Because we needed to have the legislation referred before we can publish public hearing notices, this item will be back before our Committee on Wednesday, January 13.",87,,
655,0.97,3727.824,3730.026,This will be for a public hearing and a vote.,87,,
656,0.97,3730.026,3733.896,"Thank you Maggie, thank you all.",87,,
657,0.97,3733.896,3734.497,Thank you.,88,,
658,0.97,3734.497,3741.204,"Colleagues, any items from the good of the order?",89,,
659,0.97,3741.204,3751.414,I am seeing none.,89,,
660,0.97,3751.414,3751.814,Great.,89,,
661,0.97,3751.814,3752.615,"Well, thank you all.",89,,
662,0.97,3752.615,3761.324,"This does conclude the Land-Use and neighborhoods committee of December 9, 2020.",89,,
663,0.97,3761.324,3763.693,"As a reminder, our next committee meeting will be on January 13.",89,,
664,0.97,3763.693,3764.76,This will start at 9:30 A.M.,89,,
665,0.97,3764.76,3765.628,Thank you for attending.,89,,
666,0.97,3765.628,3770.5,We are adjourned.,89,,
