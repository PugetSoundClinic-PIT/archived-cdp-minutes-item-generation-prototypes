32,0.97,105.972,144.01,"Of course, no celebration or recognition of indigenous people today would be complete if we did not recognize our very own Councilmember Debora Juarez of district 5 for her leadership and role on advancing indigenous issues for our city including her work on missing and murdered indigenous women and girls and also her important work around making sure that we have a committee at the city council level that reflects the need to focus and Prioritize issues related to the Americans in our region.",21,,

42,0.97,209.776,235.401,"This victory was possible only because of the determined activism of the urban, native community, who are still active to this day and have played a huge role in movements across the nation and have been among those who are personally present at the standing rock--just really incredible actions against the pipeline there.",22,,

51,0.97,324.223,339.706,"It forces us, as working people, to think about the kind of solidarity we need to build and the kind of United movement we need to organize to fight for a better society . The majority of us are able to have in the context of capitalism and imperialism.",22,,

There is no new information in the report.",26,,
158,0.97,1077.342,1098.263,This is merely a correlation of this for public perusal and review but I think it is really important information that Jeff Simms and Tracy Ratcliff ran down for us regarding the impact that Covid has had on shelter in particular.,26,,

162,0.97,1148.881,1174.54,"We know that that occurred at the same time that there was a corresponding increase in the amount of public visible homelessness and people camping in public places, given that there was reduced Opportunty to be in a shelter setting . The Causation could be disputed but the correlation is in disputed.",26,,
163,0.97,1174.54,1185.551,It is also notable that a significant Council shelter investments that had been made for 2021 have either been very slowly realized or have not been realized at all.,26,,
164,0.97,1185.551,1196.762,"We have gone until the middle of this month in 2021 without a singer tiny house, for example.",26,,
165,0.97,1196.762,1203.569,"The first tiny houses will be opened in Councilmember Pedersen's district, in the University district in the middle of this month.",26,,
166,0.97,1203.569,1259.992,"That will represent the first tiny House village coming Online . It is notable that we have continued, as a city, to go through Covid, operating with a significantly reduced shelter capacity . The temporary sheltering assets that have been stood up and left rather quickly when they were stood up so that would be the hotel at the executive Pacific and the Kings end in Belltown as well as an enhanced shelter . There will be more sheltering assets coming Online later this fall but in the meantime, we have been dealing with trying to catch up with the deficit at a time of really, really intense need . It is also notable that the switch in outreach teams does not seem to have had a significant change in the efficacy of outreach.",26,,
167,0.97,1259.992,1263.028,The factor in this--this is me expressing my opinion from looking at the data.,26,,
168,0.97,1263.028,1265.263,This is not necessarily a conclusion that central staff made.,26,,
169,0.97,1265.263,1277.442,"From looking at the data, it seems fairly evident that the factor most determinative of whether outreach is successful is if they have access to shelter assets they can refer people to.",26,,
170,0.97,1277.442,1283.181,That was consistent in the data provided by the navigation team and the data provided by the hope team.,26,,
171,0.97,1283.181,1301.066,"It does not indicate, from my read of it--now this gets turned over to the public and the media to render their judgment but the data seems to indicate that when shelter is available, there is considerable success for outreach.",26,,
172,0.97,1301.066,1304.569,"When shelter is at capacity, there is reduced success in moving people inside.",26,,
173,0.97,1304.569,1327.993,"That seems to be the biggest factor, rather than other things that are often speculated about like service resistance or people for whatever reason choosing to remain . It seems that access to shelter referrals is the biggest thing indicative of success from outreach.",26,,
174,0.97,1327.993,1340.806,"The final thing that I would say is the environments teams have uniquely been beneficial for the acquisition of new permanent, supportive housing for a variety of reasons.",26,,
175,0.97,1340.806,1352.217,"There is going to be a massive increase, a 47% increase in housing acquisition during the Covid period which is stark and dramatic.",26,,
176,0.97,1352.217,1359.925,There is a variety of different reasons for this including more opportunities for acquisition of hotels and motels.,26,,
177,0.97,1359.925,1371.503,We are going to have housing developments enter the private market but instead decided to mitigate potential reduction in consumer demand by selling the asset to the city.,26,,
178,0.97,1371.503,1377.609,"In the office of housing, it has been very, very adept at taking advantage of these opportunities.",26,,
179,0.97,1377.609,1396.061,It also goes without saying that a significant amount of Federal support through a variety of different measures has also given us the resources to know our local funding to pursue its opportunities for long-term acquisition.,26,,
180,0.97,1396.061,1403.568,"That does seem to be a unique Silverlining from the Covid era, the acquisition of a considerable amount of housing.",26,,
181,0.97,1403.568,1410.876,I would be Remiss if I did not NOTE at the end of my briefing that most of that housing is not yet operational.,26,,
182,0.97,1410.876,1415.58,We are not yet seeing the visible results.,26,,
183,0.97,1415.58,1428.794,Having these new units--Tracy's report indicates that 811 of those housing units will probably be operational by January 2022.,26,,
184,0.97,1428.794,1444.409,Just a few months away which should correspond to a considerable physical difference in the street and also in a considerable difference for people who are going to be able to live in those units.,26,,
185,0.97,1444.409,1448.079,I am going to release that information later this morning.,26,,
186,0.97,1448.079,1461.092,It is basically just an aggregation of data that has already reported to Council during the budget briefing two weeks ago.,26,,
187,0.97,1461.092,1475.006,It is information that there should be a fine point made for providing to the general public for context about the homelessness response and a good summary of homelessness during Covid.,26,,
188,0.97,1475.006,1494.359,"There are some lessons that we can glean going into the budget about how we structured a 2022 budget to respond to some of those trends, knowing that Unfortunately Covid and its variance will continue to be a significant factor throughout 2022.",26,,
189,0.97,1494.359,1496.561,"With that, Madam President, I don't have anything else to share.",26,,
190,0.97,1496.561,1500.866,I will turn it back over to you.,26,,

203,0.97,1539.204,1545.577,I do want to begin by acknowledging indigenous peoples' day and saying happy indigenous peoples' day to folks.,28,,
204,0.97,1545.577,1557.722,I want to think this Council in the Seattle human rights Commission that passed the resolution acknowledging this day and establishing the stay in 2014.,28,,
205,0.97,1557.722,1581.112,"In part, that resolution asks that rather than celebrating an era of Colonization and dispossession of indigenous peoples Homelands, that we instead recognize the dignity and diversity of the cultures and traditions, and aspirations of the city of Seattle's indigenous people.",28,,
206,0.97,1581.112,1597.162,"I do think that this is an important time to reflect on and acknowledge that as a city, we have an obligation to repair the harm done to our indigenous neighbors, who frankly, are suffering from the damage inflicted on the community.",28,,
207,0.97,1597.162,1605.704,"While I am excited that there are lots of festivities planned, I know that the Seattle board is planning lots of different things over the week.",28,,
208,0.97,1605.704,1610.575,I think it is important that we do take that time to reflect.,28,,
209,0.97,1610.575,1637.769,"On Friday, I was honored to be Invitedto attend the spirit returns celebration . I just want to say, I am eager to support their call for the promotion of social, cultural, and economic survival of the Duwamish tribe and to revitalize the culture to show their history and their culture with people who are here in their city.",28,,
210,0.97,1637.769,1642.474,I am also happy to know that it is now a national holiday and want to thank our president for that.,28,,

213,0.97,1665.13,1681.112,"We adopted the strategy, which allows regional organizations to be eligible for certain types of U.S. funding . We did vote to approve their draft strategy.",28,,
214,0.97,1681.112,1687.919,"They will be developing, putting that out for public comment.",28,,
215,0.97,1687.919,1690.355,Staff will release a draft for a 30 day public comment period.,28,,

218,0.97,1699.964,1706.438,We also discussed the work force recovery planning project to support an equitable recovery.,28,,
219,0.97,1706.438,1730.361,Psrc hired a consultant team to create customized regional occupational projections . what they are trying to do is identify high demand industries and help create an understanding of the regional workforce needs so we can connect people who are looking for opportunity to those opportunities.,28,,
220,0.97,1730.361,1746.01,"The consultants will develop outreach strategies that can help connect workers and Jobseekers in the region to employment and training programs that align with these higher wage, in demand occupations . that project is expected to be complete by next March.",28,,
221,0.97,1746.01,1750.315,"I am very excited about that, as you know.",28,,
222,0.97,1750.315,1761.493,"As a city, we are asking a lot of questions about how our own workforce development strategy can align with regional approaches.",28,,
223,0.97,1761.493,1772.637,"As they continue that project and we continue the conversation in the office of economic of element, I will be looking for ways that we can make sure we are supporting that regional strategy as well.",28,,
224,0.97,1772.637,1775.907,"Last week, we met with constituents during office hours.",28,,
225,0.97,1775.907,1791.956,"I had folks calling to discuss the solidarity budget . As you all know, we will be hearing lots about that in the coming weeks . I do appreciate the opportunity to hear directly from them about what their priorities are . We also discussed parking enforcement.",28,,
226,0.97,1791.956,1805.37,"We got neighbors who are concerned that working enforcement is being applied Inconsistently . Some cars are left for days and days, others being towed within 20 minutes.",28,,
227,0.97,1805.37,1819.184,We will be trying to get a better understanding of what is happening there . We also spoke with folks from the Chinatown International district . There is a desire on the part of community members there to begin a neighborhood planning process.,28,,
228,0.97,1819.184,1843.708,They have already started the process but they are looking for some support to assist with community engagement over the next year or 18 months and the goal really is to have completed a neighborhood plan for Chinatown International district that is then accepted by the city and becomes part of the work that we look at past decisions are being made.,28,,
229,0.97,1843.708,1855.119,"This week I will be visiting the Evergreen treatment services clinic to learn about the work they are doing at that site, to help folks that are trying to overcome substance abuse.",28,,

231,0.97,1872.871,1882.213,This is the first project of several that the Filipino community center plans to create a response to displacement.,28,,
232,0.97,1882.213,1912.176,"It is also one example of the many community organizations, including East African community services and Somali health board, who really are looking for help in taking land off of the speculative market so that they can create permanently affordable housing for folks who are at risk of displacement and for neighbors who have already been displaced from Seattle and who are looking for a way to return to their communities so that they can try to capture that community cohesion that makes for strong, vibrant neighborhoods.",28,,
233,0.97,1912.176,1927.992,"Very excited to go visit the Filipino project and to continue working with other folks, particularly in district 2 who are trying to accomplish the same goals so we can stem displacement.",28,,

Seattle is called out as a city that is leading the way in quickly distributing Federal relief to boost household and economic recovery . They found that leaders of the 20 largest American cities have committed only 18% of the flexible funds that they received from the American rescue plan act but compared to Seattle, where the Council approved the Seattle rescue plan, we have committed half of our available funding.",51,,

500,0.97,4141.904,4143.339,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Mosqueda.",54,,
501,0.97,4143.339,4164.426,I have also financed the opportunity to review that report and I find it really interesting that it is also used as a citation as two different cities that are experimenting with versions of basic income programs of which certainly the direct Cashless system certainly did as a result of the discernment dollars.,54,,
502,0.97,4164.426,4175.638,It is an example of how basic income can combat poverty and income inequality in our communities and look forward to additional conversations in that space as well.,54,,
503,0.97,4175.638,4182.545,I will go ahead and give my quick report here and then we will be done with Council briefing.,55,,
504,0.97,4182.545,4191.053,"Really quickly, nothing on the introduction and referral calendar this week.",55,,
505,0.97,4191.053,4194.757,"I do have the one and only item on today's city council agenda, which is Council vote 120186.",55,,
506,0.97,4194.757,4211.574,"This bill relates to additional pay for our front-line city employees to acknowledge hardships, offset additional costs, and retain front-line city employees to continue to deliver in person essential city services during the Covid- 19 health emergency.",55,,
507,0.97,4211.574,4220.95,The terms of the front-line worker pay were negotiated with various representing city employees across the spectrum.,55,,
508,0.97,4220.95,4231.493,This legislation ratifies three tentative agreements with all the labor unions who have agreed to the terms.,55,,
509,0.97,4231.493,4237.199,"In addition to the represented front-line workers who may receive this additional pay, Non-Represented workers will also be eligible for any benefits described in the agreement.",55,,
510,0.97,4237.199,4239.802,"This afternoon, I will bring one amendment.",55,,
511,0.97,4239.802,4242.404,It is listed as amendment a.,55,,
512,0.97,4242.404,4257.486,"This amendment is reflective of the work that occurred last week . last week, the city reached an additional tentative agreement with 17.",55,,
513,0.97,4257.486,4261.824,This agreement includes the same terms and benefits as the other agreements included in the bill.,55,,
514,0.97,4261.824,4286.915,The late edition of this tentative agreement as reflected in amendment eight is simply the result of sequencing at large part because the executive led negotiations with city Medians did not initially include the central stock analyst bargaining unit and those negotiations were led by the legislative Department together with legal relations.,55,,
515,0.97,4286.915,4310.806,"Now that it is at a conclusion, we have an agreement and would like to incorporate our bargaining unit in the overall Council bill related to additional pay . amendment a would attach the new tentative agreement with our Council central staff to the Council bill so that it would be ratified along with the other agreements already included in the legislation that was transmitted to us by the executive branch.",55,,
516,0.97,4310.806,4321.483,"I do want to note, colleagues, on the issues related to additional pay for front-line workers, the city has now reached tentative agreements with all of the unions representing city employees with only one exception.",55,,
517,0.97,4321.483,4330.592,"The Seattle police officers killed, despite being offered the same terms and benefits, did reject this additional pay.",55,,
518,0.97,4330.592,4341.97,Their decision to reject the proposed terms is presumably related to the back room mandate which all other city means have accepted and agreed to comply with.,55,,
519,0.97,4341.97,4345.407,I am really grateful to those officers.,55,,
520,0.97,4345.407,4350.579,They have voluntarily agreed to comply with the vaccine mandate.,55,,
521,0.97,4350.579,4361.824,I do hope that the remaining officers will also follow suit for our collective public health.,55,,
522,0.97,4361.824,4383.512,"I want to again make sure that for those public employees who have complied with the vaccine mandate, which I believe is critical for our city and country to really defeat this pandemic, we have to hold our epic safety workers and all of our front-line workers to the highest expectations.",55,,
523,0.97,4383.512,4387.449,We are serious about achieving an end to the pandemic.,55,,
524,0.97,4387.449,4412.241,I appreciate that a large majority of officers have submitted their vaccination confirmation forms already and I strongly implore those who have not yet complied to please comply for the vaccine requirement before the city is put in a position of needing to terminate noncompliant officers because of this public health mandate . This will be the bill that we will consider this afternoon at 2:00.,55,,
525,0.97,4412.241,4422.584,"It is the only item on this afternoon's agenda Besides payment of the bills . with that being said, I have nothing else to report.",55,,
526,0.97,4422.584,4448.21,"I did want to give one quick update . Many of you have over the last couple of weeks, heard some of us on the Council talk about a behavioral health crisis convening, a summit, if you will . It was actually called by many of our behavioral health crisis service providers in the region.",55,,
527,0.97,4448.21,4499.728,We did have an opportunity to have that convening last week on October 5. it was a 90 minute meeting in which we had an opportunity to hear testimonials from various leaders within our behavioral service provider community about the feelings of our overall system and meeting the needs of those people with serious behavioral health conditions . one of the things that was made very clear is that this was not a call for additional law enforcement or a law enforcement response approach but a call for a better crisis response system that could act with evaluating needs and providing services including involuntary inpatient treatment when necessary.,55,,
528,0.97,4499.728,4530.092,"I am really humbled to have had an opportunity to sit and listen to working County behavioral health provider community . in that vein was very comforted by the fact that they had already identified six different strategies that are both in the short-term, Midterm, and long-term to help address the shortfalls of our behavioral health system as it currently exists.",55,,
529,0.97,4530.092,4564.726,This is a combination of local solutions but also an opportunity to continue to work together in coalition to develop state level recommendations in the coming months that are really going to be critical to allowing some of these additional local solutions to be sustainable and to really make a difference we need to provide the tools that our behavioral health provider community needs to adequately meet the needs of those who are experiencing behavioral health or mental health crises throughout our community.,55,,
530,0.97,4564.726,4603.365,"Again, there is some need to clarify the implementation and interpretation of state house bill 1310 but we do expect that House bill 1310 will remain the law of the land statewide . as a result, it is incumbent upon us as government and our behavioral health providers, to work together to identify when House bill 1310 does apply and implicate a law enforcement responsibility when those law enforcement services are needed in those limited circumstances.",55,,
531,0.97,4603.365,4610.572,"And, when they are not . much more to come on this area.",55,,
532,0.97,4610.572,4617.379,I really did appreciate the opportunity to connect with our human service providers to have this really important conversation.,55,,
533,0.97,4617.379,4621.683,"Colleagues, any comments or questions on that?",55,,
534,0.97,4621.683,4628.256,I am not seeing any additional hands raised . I do think this concludes our agenda for this morning.,55,,
535,0.97,4628.256,4637.099,We don't have anything else to discuss so we will be adjourned for today and I will see you all at 2:00.,55,,
536,0.97,4637.099,4642.437,Thank you so much.,55,,
