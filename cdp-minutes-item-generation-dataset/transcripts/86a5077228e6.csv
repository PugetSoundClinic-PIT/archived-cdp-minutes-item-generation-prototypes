32,0.97,137.871,144.077,It remains a strong intent of the city Council to have public comment regularly included on meeting Agendas.,12,,
33,0.97,144.077,157.323,However the city council reserves the right to modify these if it we deem the system is being abused or is unsuitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and in a manner in which we're able to conduct our necessary business.,12,,

54,0.97,278.745,278.978,Hi.,13,,
55,0.97,278.978,295.361,Apologies if I don't have an item related to today's agenda but I wanted to speak generally to the proposed transportation plan and a bit about the vision zero plan of the past.,13,,
56,0.97,295.361,303.936,Ten years ago I came upon a dead cyclist in the road who had been hit by a truck just minutes before and that image sticks with me today.,13,,
57,0.97,303.936,309.042,Especially now that I bike these streets with my toddler every day.,13,,
58,0.97,309.042,316.315,When Delridge showed up a as protected bike Lane priority I was excited to think this area has become safe.,13,,
59,0.97,316.315,321.254,I voted strongly because of this.,13,,
60,0.97,321.254,325.758,Remove bike lanes as advocacy groups and residents pushed back.,13,,
61,0.97,325.758,331.864,Then the pandemic came along and the bridge closed.,13,,
62,0.97,331.864,332.398,Bike sales skyrocketed.,13,,
63,0.97,332.398,334.934,With a 1500% increase in bike trips.,13,,
64,0.97,334.934,338.304,Nothing actually changed to the plans themselves.,13,,
65,0.97,338.304,347.547,Delridge is done and what we have is Street parking where nearly every business and home has Offstreet parking and dedicated turn lanes.,13,,
66,0.97,347.547,358.257,We were provided with a bike Lane that only goes one way without a return option it's essentially useless.,13,,
67,0.97,358.257,360.927,I still see bikers Honked at by cars.,13,,
68,0.97,360.927,362.195,Why are they still Biking here?,13,,
69,0.97,362.195,364.997,This was the one flat route and everything for locals is here on the street.,13,,
70,0.97,364.997,370.336,"The schools accident the day cares, the libraries, the community center.",13,,
71,0.97,370.336,373.206,We'll just go bike on the Greenway.,13,,
72,0.97,373.206,379.879,You mean the Greenway where last summer I witnessed a car turn on to without slowing?,13,,
73,0.97,379.879,383.349,Had someone been in that street they surely would have been killed.,13,,
74,0.97,383.349,388.955,I do not exaggerate when I say this every friend we have or made has moved.,13,,
75,0.97,388.955,399.866,One told me the moments they were moving the Northbound bike Lane in Ront of her house was the moment she decided to move.,13,,
76,0.97,399.866,405.071,City dedicated to reducing its dependence on cars.,13,,
77,0.97,405.071,416.482,Continues to push Nonvehicle transportation further down its priorities.,13,,
78,0.97,416.482,425.391,Thank you very much for those comments and please send the rest of your comments to the Council.,14,,
79,0.97,425.391,434.901,You can send it to Council @ Seattle.Gov or you can send it to me as the chair.,14,,
80,0.97,434.901,435.201,Thank you.,14,,

124,0.97,612.011,630.062,I've been in Seattle for the past ten years where I moved up here for a masters of landscape architecture at Uw and then moved on to work at Sdot in the public space management program where I worked on programs to activate the right of way.,23,,
125,0.97,630.062,642.708,I view Bicycling and good bicycle infrastructure as an integral part of our functioning transportation system and a way to make the city more vibrant and people centered.,23,,
126,0.97,642.708,658.224,"I personally bike as my primary form of transportation when I can because of the personal and social and environmental benefits, but I realize that not everybody has access to Biking in this way so would like to reduce some of those barriers to entry.",23,,
127,0.97,658.224,666.666,I have two kids who are now of Biking age where they can ride in the road and it's kind of terrifying.,23,,
128,0.97,666.666,678.844,So I think that I would like to help advocate for and imagine a city where a 4 or 5-Year-Old could safely and comfortably bike through any part of the city.,23,,
129,0.97,678.844,685.751,So I'm very excited about the prospect of being on the board.,23,,

247,0.97,1175.741,1197.829,I know the safety committee did a lot of work on their end report and it it was really heartening to see the Seattle public schools working with Sdot and working with community members and one of their proposals was to have the city council fund Gps software for school buses and there's a lot of support for that.,63,,
248,0.97,1197.829,1204.703,We just because the revenues on the city side went down we weren't able to fund that item.,63,,
249,0.97,1204.703,1205.704,We tried to do that.,63,,

289,0.97,1348.38,1359.624,And I want to thank chair--I want to thank Council member M Mosqueda for sponsoring this legislation.,81,,
290,0.97,1359.624,1376.007,It impacts Seattle Department of transportation because it's the fees that are paid for the vacating of streets or alleyways and it also affects the office of housing because if it's structured up front they can benefit.,81,,
291,0.97,1376.007,1382.247,"Office of housing can have more funds available for project to increase affordable housing, for example.",81,,
292,0.97,1382.247,1384.316,Which is a priority of ours.,81,,
293,0.97,1384.316,1386.885,So we're hearing this item in both committees.,81,,
294,0.97,1386.885,1391.523,In this committee we're hearing it just as a briefing and discussion.,81,,
295,0.97,1391.523,1396.495,"The real action will take place next week, Tuesday in the Finance and housing committee.",81,,
296,0.97,1396.495,1406.671,Wanted committee members to hear about this and Council member Mosqueda has been very open to input on this bill.,81,,
297,0.97,1406.671,1409.775,And she may join us here as well.,81,,
298,0.97,1409.775,1416.448,We will reach out and let her know we're getting start Odden this one.,81,,
299,0.97,1416.448,1419.351,We do have central staff here is with us.,81,,
300,0.97,1419.351,1421.82,"Lish Whitson, thank you for your work on this bill.",81,,
301,0.97,1421.82,1429.594,Why don't we turn it over to you for a presentation and we can ask some questions.,81,,
302,0.97,1429.594,1435.267,Good morning.,82,,
303,0.97,1435.267,1435.6,Lish Whitson.,82,,
304,0.97,1435.6,1436.268,Council central staff.,82,,
305,0.97,1436.268,1446.611,Council bill bill.,82,,
306,0.97,1449.781,1458.657,State law allows but in most cases doesn't require the city to require payment of the appraised value of the right of way.,82,,
307,0.97,1458.657,1465.53,One exception is shoreline street ends where the city must receive the appraised value of the right of way.,82,,
308,0.97,1465.53,1469.1,"The city currently Exempts city, state and Federal agencies from paying these costs.",82,,
309,0.97,1469.1,1482.08,"This bill would also exempt projects that receive city, state, county or federal funding and provide affordable housing at rent and income levels consist with housing and funding policies.",82,,
310,0.97,1482.08,1488.22,Funds from street vacations under state law are required to be allocated to transportation or open space projects.,82,,
311,0.97,1488.22,1498.93,"Consequently, the effect of the bill would be to reduce transportation funding and reduce costs to build affordable housing when a street vacation is required.",82,,
312,0.97,1498.93,1509.541,As mentioned the bill will be discussed and potentially voted on at the next housing and Finance Committee meeting.,82,,
313,0.97,1509.541,1512.344,That's all I have.,82,,
314,0.97,1512.344,1512.644,Thank you.,82,,
315,0.97,1512.644,1524.222,"Committee members, I'll have a few questions here about the bill but wanted to see if anybody else wanted to go first.",83,,
316,0.97,1524.222,1529.694,I'll talk very slowly in case Council member Mosqueda wants to join us.,83,,
317,0.97,1529.694,1534.065,So I'll go ahead and ask a few questions to get us started on this.,83,,
318,0.97,1534.065,1542.674,Again the voting on this will actually take place the Finance Committee next Tuesday.,83,,
319,0.97,1542.674,1561.226,"So if there are amendments, I think Lish is it fair to say you'd want to receive them this week so you can revise them and get them approved by city attorney's office, et cetera, and then publication potentially on the agenda.",83,,
320,0.97,1561.226,1562.227,Council member Herbold.,83,,
321,0.97,1562.227,1562.527,Go ahead.,83,,
322,0.97,1562.527,1562.794,Sorry.,84,,
323,0.97,1562.794,1570.735,I didn't mean to--my hand raising interrupt your line of questioning or Lish' response.,84,,
324,0.97,1570.735,1571.436,"No, it's okay.",85,,
325,0.97,1571.436,1575.774,"Lish, is that correct you'd like to get them this week?",85,,
326,0.97,1575.774,1576.041,Yeah.,86,,
327,0.97,1576.041,1580.145,Amendments this week would be very helpful.,86,,
328,0.97,1580.145,1580.445,Thank you.,86,,
329,0.97,1580.445,1580.712,Okay.,87,,
330,0.97,1580.712,1583.682,"And Council member Herbold, you can go first with your questions.",87,,
331,0.97,1583.682,1588.687,I know you've got a very deep background on low income housing.,87,,
332,0.97,1588.687,1589.054,Thank you.,88,,
333,0.97,1589.054,1597.963,Just and Lish you may have already addressed this and I might have missed it.,88,,
334,0.97,1597.963,1619.484,But the language here refers to from the Affordability levels for rents as consistent with the housing's funding policies as adopted by Ordnance 125308.,88,,
335,0.97,1619.484,1624.089,Wondering if you can talk about those Affordability levels.,88,,
336,0.97,1624.089,1636.668,But also if you could then do what the expectations are as it relates specifically to percentage of affordable housing units.,88,,
337,0.97,1636.668,1639.404,That would be required.,88,,
338,0.97,1639.404,1639.704,Sure.,89,,
339,0.97,1639.704,1653.018,The bill is silent on the percentage of units in the project that would need to be affordable.,89,,
340,0.97,1653.018,1657.422,They're updated frequently by Council approximately every two years.,89,,
341,0.97,1657.422,1669.434,They currently require housing to be affordable at 60% or below of area median income.,89,,
342,0.97,1669.434,1677.842,That's the reference to in the legislation to ordinance 125308?,90,,
343,0.97,1677.842,1680.912,That's where the 60% is identified?,90,,
344,0.97,1680.912,1681.613,Yeah.,91,,
345,0.97,1681.613,1685.016,The most recent amendment was adopted in 2019.,91,,
346,0.97,1685.016,1696.094,There's a statement of legislative intent that the council passed last month asking for office of housing to recommend some changes to those policies.,91,,
347,0.97,1696.094,1712.544,They're updated fairly frequently and the idea is to allow for these regulations to change along with those changes to city policy without requiring amendments every couple years.,91,,
348,0.97,1712.544,1731.029,Those same city policies are silent on the number or percentage of units that are expected for purposes of--I guess this would be sort of a performance requirement?,92,,
349,0.97,1731.029,1732.297,Correct.,93,,
350,0.97,1732.297,1740.839,If we wanted to specify that expectation we'd need to offer an amendment.,94,,
351,0.97,1740.839,1741.139,Correct.,95,,
352,0.97,1741.139,1742.674,Okay.,96,,
353,0.97,1742.674,1743.108,Thank you.,96,,
354,0.97,1743.108,1746.111,Thank you Council member Herbold.,97,,
355,0.97,1746.111,1746.544,I appreciate that.,97,,
356,0.97,1746.544,1768.133,"I know when we--we all want to have more affordable housing and for the details like that matter tremendously and like you mentioned the percentage of AMI or the Affordability level and then the percentage of units I agree that that's--I don't see that in the bill and Lish, thanks for confirming that.",97,,
357,0.97,1768.133,1775.673,Maybe that was the intent to have something like that or to reference something.,97,,
358,0.97,1775.673,1792.824,"But if it's not ironclad I would support an amendment to specify the percentage of units basically for those listening in the public, I guess the concept here as I understand it is we are--we want to encourage affordable housing.",97,,
359,0.97,1792.824,1800.431,"There is something the real estate developer's asking for to get the street vacated for free, essentially.",97,,
360,0.97,1800.431,1801.733,Or the Alleyway for free.,97,,
361,0.97,1801.733,1803.868,We have to have a public benefit.,97,,
362,0.97,1803.868,1807.839,"But then it's like Okay, devil's in the details.",97,,
363,0.97,1807.839,1808.339,How affordable is it?,97,,
364,0.97,1808.339,1819.984,"We don't want a project that sets aside 5% of its units for affordable housing then get as free, you know, we vacate the street for no cost.",97,,
365,0.97,1819.984,1831.262,"So as I understand it the--in the mandatory housing Affordability ordinance, one of the main ordinances--the latest one.",97,,
366,0.97,1831.262,1844.209,"I believe Lish, is this correct it's a 40%--at least 40% of the units need to be affordable for it to be exempt from Hma fees?",97,,
367,0.97,1844.209,1844.509,Yes.,98,,
368,0.97,1844.509,1851.316,Under the mandatory housing Affordability housing program.,98,,
369,0.97,1851.316,1857.755,If they have 40% or more of their units affordable at or below 40%.,98,,
370,0.97,1857.755,1859.991,60% of the area median income.,98,,
371,0.97,1859.991,1860.258,Okay.,99,,
372,0.97,1860.258,1874.272,And I think we recently I think the Council recently granted an exemption from the vacation fees of an Alleyway for grant Street Commons in the Mount Baker neighborhood.,99,,
373,0.97,1874.272,1877.942,I Hi 47% percent of the units were set aside.,99,,
374,0.97,1877.942,1889.754,"As I understand it the low income housing program which is popular, has one of the criteria's 40% of the units must be set aside.",99,,
375,0.97,1889.754,1899.063,So 40% seems like it would seem to be a logical minimum threshold.,99,,
376,0.97,1899.063,1906.604,"Councilmember Herbold if you're willing to work with it together, I'm happy to put forward an amendment like that with you.",99,,
377,0.97,1906.604,1909.274,"Council President--Oh, go ahead.",100,,
378,0.97,1909.274,1911.976,I see Council President Gonzalez has her hand up.,101,,
379,0.97,1911.976,1920.852,I had one other thought on this but I'll hold it to hear from Council President Gonzalez.,101,,
380,0.97,1920.852,1921.886,Council President.,102,,
381,0.97,1921.886,1922.754,Thanks so much.,103,,
382,0.97,1922.754,1949.48,"Lish on this conversation related to imposing a percentage, what would the effect be of such a requirement in terms of underlying legislation in the overall Overarching goal of wanting to make it less burdensome to create affordable housing?",103,,
383,0.97,1949.48,1949.747,Yeah.,104,,
384,0.97,1949.747,1967.865,So a project that for example has 30% of units at 60% AMI and receives public funding for that to subsidize those units wouldn't have to pay the street vacation fees.,104,,
385,0.97,1967.865,1973.304,Or compensate the city for the value of the right of way that's being vacated.,104,,
386,0.97,1973.304,1979.811,So it would increase the cost for those projects.,104,,
387,0.97,1979.811,1994.459,A project that has over 40% of units affordable under the terms of this legislation would not have to pay those costs.,104,,
388,0.97,1994.459,2010.675,"Okay, so in effect could that result in individuals who are sort of below that threshold because it doesn't pencil out for them to just forgo creating any Creatable housing on site?",105,,
389,0.97,2010.675,2022.387,"Um, you know, I don't know how many projects we receive or are built that includes a mix like that.",106,,
390,0.97,2022.387,2034.899,But it would weigh into the developer's decision of whether or not to pursue public funding for affordable units in that project.,106,,
391,0.97,2034.899,2036.501,It would be a project specific decision.,106,,
392,0.97,2036.501,2058.856,Lish is there a way for you to get information about projects in the--you know sort of historic data on the kinds of projects that we receive that could have or would have been impacted if this legislation included a threshold?,107,,
393,0.97,2058.856,2059.123,Yeah.,108,,
394,0.97,2059.123,2070.535,For Street vacation projects generally I know we have only seen projects where 100% of the units were affordable within the structure that was receiving the vacation.,108,,
395,0.97,2070.535,2083.714,But I will check with the office of housing on whether they are funding projects that include for example 25 or 30% of units affordable.,108,,
396,0.97,2083.714,2102.2,I think that would be helpful just to get a better understanding that the potential amendment that's currently being discussed would create an unintended consequence in terms of foregoing the construction of affordable housing of any affordable housing units.,109,,
397,0.97,2102.2,2123.254,I think it's important for the Council to understand what the cost effectively in terms of additional affordable housing units even if it's just a handful of them would be if there is an amendment brought forward that is successful that would require a minimum number.,109,,
398,0.97,2123.254,2145.643,"I think I understand the motivation behind that minimum number, but I think it's Importants for us to have a full understanding of what the potential consequence would be in terms of potential projects that we're seeing coming through the pipeline that would be negatively impacted by such an amendment.",109,,
399,0.97,2145.643,2158.189,"It would be helpful to me if you could gather some of that information, Lish.",109,,
400,0.97,2158.189,2158.456,Good.,110,,
401,0.97,2158.456,2158.756,Thank you.,110,,
402,0.97,2158.756,2161.626,"Council member Herbold, did you have a Followup question?",110,,
403,0.97,2161.626,2169.4,I think it's complementary to the line of questioning from Council President Gonzalez.,111,,
404,0.97,2169.4,2184.549,It's sort of the flip side of the question which is the issue of like what--how much is the city foregoing with an ordinance like this.,111,,
405,0.97,2184.549,2197.762,How much is the city not collecting in these fees.,111,,
406,0.97,2197.762,2213.711,"I think that's a, for an average project that's an important thing to potentially take a look at in considering what our expectation is in exchange.",111,,
407,0.97,2213.711,2239.937,"So if a project is as a result of an ordinance like that not going to be credit contributing to the general Fund, you know, X number of hundreds of thousands of dollars and we are getting a single unit of affordable housing in exchange, that's I think something that we need to consider whether or not that is a sufficient value.",111,,
408,0.97,2239.937,2259.49,So having a little bit more granule Layaway detail about how much funding the city would forego on an average project that would be qualifying under this proposed ordinance would be super helpful.,111,,
409,0.97,2259.49,2259.79,Okay.,112,,
410,0.97,2259.79,2269.233,So we have examples of two affordable housing projects that have recently come before the Council and been approved.,112,,
411,0.97,2269.233,2271.435,Commons which Council approved last month.,112,,
412,0.97,2271.435,2277.041,We don't have an appraisal of the right of way there.,112,,
413,0.97,2277.041,2286.851,Based on the assessed value of the property that was granted to be vacated.,112,,
414,0.97,2286.851,2296.494,"Was between 400 and $500,000 for that alley and willow crossing project which was approved at the end of 2019.",112,,
415,0.97,2296.494,2301.666,They have done an appraisal and that looks like it's in the same ballpark.,112,,
416,0.97,2301.666,2314.278,"So can imagine one project every two years and approximately 400 to $500,000 per project.",112,,
417,0.97,2314.278,2314.578,Thanks.,113,,
418,0.97,2314.578,2325.489,"So about $500,000 and in those instances they--those--the percentage of units that are affordable in those projects were 40%?",113,,
419,0.97,2325.489,2333.964,100% of the units in both of those projects were affordable.,114,,
420,0.97,2333.964,2334.298,"Oh, 100%.",115,,
421,0.97,2334.298,2334.532,Great.,115,,
422,0.97,2334.532,2334.832,Thank you.,115,,
423,0.97,2334.832,2340.271,The grant Street project is a bigger project that includes three different sites.,116,,
424,0.97,2340.271,2348.112,But the Mount Baker housing project is 100% affordable and that's the block where the alley is being vacated.,116,,
425,0.97,2348.112,2377.875,"How does that, chair Pedersen mentioned the Mha regulatory standards for expanded development capacity in exchange for affordable housing development and the ability to be exempt from those fees for affordable housing development.",117,,
426,0.97,2377.875,2395.359,"How does that value to benefit ratio compare to--for Mha compare to 40% for a $500,000 project in this instance?",117,,
427,0.97,2395.359,2398.028,I do not know.,118,,
428,0.97,2398.028,2404.668,I will try and see if we can figure that out.,118,,
429,0.97,2404.668,2406.637,Thank you so much.,119,,
430,0.97,2406.637,2425.623,Thank you for those questions and appreciate sponsor bringing this forward and I think we can--I think it sounds like there's support for the spirit of this it's just if there are some details that need to be fleshed out a little bit to make sure there are no loopholes.,120,,
431,0.97,2425.623,2428.893,We do value those Street vacation fees.,120,,
432,0.97,2428.893,2432.53,We use those for Visionist row projects and other things.,120,,
433,0.97,2432.53,2435.132,But we also want that affordable housing.,120,,
434,0.97,2435.132,2444.141,This is the fun part of the job is making the policy choice.,120,,
435,0.97,2444.141,2445.476,The Tradeoffs and considering those.,120,,
436,0.97,2445.476,2451.382,It'll be Tuesday at Finance and housing committee where they will vote on this.,120,,
437,0.97,2451.382,2458.389,We'll get amendments to central staff this week.,120,,
438,0.97,2458.389,2468.699,I don't think Council member Mosqueda has joined us so I know she'll be speaking to it at length on Tuesday.,120,,
439,0.97,2468.699,2468.999,All right.,120,,
440,0.97,2468.999,2469.9,Appreciate it.,120,,
441,0.97,2469.9,2472.436,Any final questions before we move on?,120,,
442,0.97,2472.436,2472.736,All right.,120,,
443,0.97,2472.736,2476.173,"Thank you very much, Lish.",120,,
444,0.97,2476.173,2476.64,Appreciate it.,120,,
445,0.97,2476.64,2486.784,Will the clerk please read the short title of the next agenda item into the record?,120,,

451,0.97,2514.578,2519.35,I want to thank Council member Herbold for her leadership working on this issue.,122,,
452,0.97,2519.35,2528.092,You know as we know there's several advisory boards that we staff ourselves.,122,,
453,0.97,2528.092,2534.865,Both staff from the departments as well as Council members serve on these boards.,122,,
454,0.97,2534.865,2538.569,"Transportation and also environmental boards, et cetera.",122,,
455,0.97,2538.569,2543.107,This is one of them.,122,,
456,0.97,2543.107,2544.909,So Brian goodnight.,122,,
457,0.97,2544.909,2551.248,Let us know about this resolution before we turn it over to Seattle public utilities.,122,,

462,0.97,2569.9,2572.503,This would ratify the 2021 update.,123,,
463,0.97,2572.503,2574.905,Which was ratified by Council in 2005.,123,,
464,0.97,2574.905,2582.212,And that was the extent of my remarks since Andrea and Martha and matt are here.,123,,
465,0.97,2582.212,2584.381,They know more about this than I do.,123,,
466,0.97,2584.381,2584.815,"Yes, thank you.",124,,

474,0.97,2621.352,2628.993,"And I was involved in the negotiating the consent decree, which led to the ramp up of our program.",125,,

480,0.97,2664.661,2668.032,This resolution before you ratifies the habitat plan.,125,,
481,0.97,2668.032,2682.479,Also known as water resources recovery area 9. the habitat plan identifies an array of recovery strategies and more than 100 capital projects developed among the government jurisdictions in the entire Basin.,125,,
482,0.97,2682.479,2686.717,The other city councils in this water shed are approving similar resolutions to support this plan.,125,,
483,0.97,2686.717,2700.064,And so with that I'd like to turn it over to Martha and matt who have a short presentation about the action we're hoping the committee will take this morning.,125,,
484,0.97,2700.064,2700.364,Thank you.,125,,
485,0.97,2700.364,2700.931,"Good morning, council.",126,,

495,0.97,2722.82,2723.02,Okay.,128,,
496,0.97,2723.02,2727.091,I didn't share correctly.,128,,
497,0.97,2727.091,2728.358,Hang on.,128,,
498,0.97,2728.358,2734.598,Share.,128,,

503,0.97,2740.204,2741.505,I'm Martha Neuman.,130,,
504,0.97,2741.505,2742.673,I'm here with matt Goehring.,130,,
505,0.97,2742.673,2746.143,So we'll give a quick presentation on why we're here today.,130,,
506,0.97,2746.143,2756.42,Little bit of overview about the salmon recovery work in the Green/Duwamish and a little bit about the plan.,130,,
507,0.97,2756.42,2761.792,So I think everybody has covered this well.,130,,
508,0.97,2761.792,2766.163,The ratification is an update to the plan that was adopted in 2005.,130,,
509,0.97,2766.163,2781.345,That plan serves as the blueprint for salmon recovery in the Green/Duwamish and as Brian said it will be updated by all the partners who participate in this work.,130,,
510,0.97,2781.345,2785.182,"Okay, quick context about recovery.",130,,
511,0.97,2785.182,2786.884,So this is about Shinook recovery.,130,,
512,0.97,2786.884,2790.721,Organized by very large river basins.,130,,
513,0.97,2790.721,2793.023,So the Puget sound being one.,130,,
514,0.97,2793.023,2798.929,Within that there are these water resource inventory areas.,130,,
515,0.97,2798.929,2810.607,"The city participants--so why, Hinook the city participants in three of these.",130,,
516,0.97,2810.607,2814.778,Our interest there is.,130,,
517,0.97,2814.778,2817.514,The Lake Washington Cedar Sammamish.,130,,
518,0.97,2817.514,2819.483,Then Wria 9 which is the Green- Duwamish.,130,,
519,0.97,2819.483,2821.418,So this is kind of a busy slide.,130,,
520,0.97,2821.418,2832.162,"What you see here on the right hand side is the Chinook salmon, you know, the long decline starting in the late 1800S.",130,,
521,0.97,2832.162,2838.535,You can see the low levels of population we have been experiencing for quite some time.,130,,
522,0.97,2838.535,2844.208,What you see on the left hand side is the listing and the recovery work.,130,,
523,0.97,2844.208,2849.78,"In 1999, Chinook salmon were listed as threatened under the Federal endangered species act.",130,,
524,0.97,2849.78,2860.39,Shortly after that the local government started working together which I'll cover in a little bit and have been working together since that time till now.,130,,
525,0.97,2860.39,2864.561,In 2005 the first recovery plan was put together for the Green- Duwamish.,130,,
526,0.97,2864.561,2875.939,Then that plan as well as plans for each of those other basins in Puget sound were rolled up into what's called the Puget sound recovery plan for Chinook.,130,,
527,0.97,2875.939,2876.673,That was approved In2007.,130,,
528,0.97,2876.673,2885.082,Here we are in 2021 and doing an update to the plan for the Green-Duwamish.,130,,
529,0.97,2885.082,2888.452,Quick slide about the numbers of fish we see.,130,,
530,0.97,2888.452,2892.456,This is a little busy here.,130,,
531,0.97,2892.456,2897.427,So you see these dash lines near the bottom of the slide.,130,,
532,0.97,2897.427,2900.864,That's called the viable sound population goal.,130,,
533,0.97,2900.864,2911.875,Those are a variety of factors set by NOAA and national Marine fishery service that would lead to a available Chinook population.,130,,
534,0.97,2911.875,2917.681,"The green line, those are the number of natural returning Spawners.",130,,
535,0.97,2917.681,2918.682,Those are the Non-Hatchery fish.,130,,
536,0.97,2918.682,2922.252,You can see those numbers are low.,130,,
537,0.97,2922.252,2922.753,They've remained low.,130,,
538,0.97,2922.753,2928.959,"Then the blue line shows all of the returning Spawners coming back, including the Hatchery fish.",130,,
539,0.97,2928.959,2935.899,"And matt can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think these numbers look pretty similar to what we see in Puget sound.",130,,
540,0.97,2935.899,2943.64,We just haven't seen a lot of change over time since the listing.,130,,
541,0.97,2943.64,2947.678,"Okay, so a few facts about the Green-Duwamish watershed.",130,,
542,0.97,2947.678,2954.718,This is--we are the most urban watershed in Puget sound.,130,,
543,0.97,2954.718,2955.218,Let's see.,130,,
544,0.97,2955.218,2961.124,There are 17 local governments who participate in this effort.,130,,
545,0.97,2961.124,2969.266,"And one of the reasons to work together is it really, it's not each jurisdiction going it alone.",130,,
546,0.97,2969.266,2972.135,Seattle can't say we have this great project but other people don't.,130,,
547,0.97,2972.135,2981.144,Everybody is working together to agree on what are the most important actions to take for salmon recovery.,130,,
548,0.97,2981.144,2982.179,So working together in partnership.,130,,
549,0.97,2982.179,2989.152,Here's a Scum of things we have big things that we have Plushed over the last 20 years.,130,,
550,0.97,2989.152,2996.159,"Over $200 million in investments from local, state and Federal monies.",130,,
551,0.97,2996.159,2999.73,So levy realignments to restore the shoreline.,130,,
552,0.97,2999.73,3006.536,Marine shoreline restoration is very important in our areas.,130,,
553,0.97,3006.536,3012.376,Revegetationest you ware shallow habitat.,130,,
554,0.97,3012.376,3016.68,We contribute--we've contributed almost $200 million since 2001.,130,,
555,0.97,3016.68,3025.989,"Our annual contribution to that effort is about $120,000.",130,,
556,0.97,3025.989,3032.796,"So the update, the update you can see here the list of what's in there.",130,,
557,0.97,3032.796,3034.364,Updates the current status.,130,,
558,0.97,3034.364,3036.666,Incorporates new and updated science.,130,,
559,0.97,3036.666,3038.668,Updated habitat goals.,130,,
560,0.97,3038.668,3040.137,Refines the recovery strategies.,130,,
561,0.97,3040.137,3045.208,There's an updated capital project list and an updated monitoring and Adaptive management plan.,130,,
562,0.97,3045.208,3054.618,I think one of the main points is this plan has validated the update the original plan.,130,,
563,0.97,3054.618,3059.723,There are more Tweaks and modifications rather than changes.,130,,
564,0.97,3059.723,3071.668,"This slide is an example, talks about the things that are important in the portions of the Green-Duwamish watershed that are within Seattle.",130,,
565,0.97,3071.668,3076.339,These areas in the Duwamish are important and critical for juvenile fish.,130,,
566,0.97,3076.339,3080.677,Those are the small kind of 3 to 5-Centimeter fish.,130,,
567,0.97,3080.677,3086.683,Protecting and restoring and enhancing the Marine shorelines.,130,,
568,0.97,3086.683,3088.418,Same for Estuarine habitat.,130,,
569,0.97,3088.418,3094.624,Improving sediment and water quality.,130,,
570,0.97,3094.624,3096.326,Revegetating the Riparian corridors.,130,,
571,0.97,3096.326,3098.261,There's an updated capital project list.,130,,
572,0.97,3098.261,3100.964,This is really where the dollars should be focused.,130,,
573,0.97,3100.964,3110.14,You can see 39 near shore projects are included and 19 projects in the Duwamish.,130,,
574,0.97,3110.14,3113.143,Some of these are city responsibilities.,130,,
575,0.97,3113.143,3115.745,"Including city light, Spu and parks.",130,,
576,0.97,3115.745,3132.629,The projects range from things like Lowman Beach that you see down here on the left which is matt informs me is in construction right now and Hamm Creek which is still a conceptual project.,130,,
577,0.97,3132.629,3138.869,People still thinking about what is the right thing to do there.,130,,
578,0.97,3138.869,3150.914,"So by ratifying this plan we are, the city of Seattle is affirming that this is a collaborative watershed approach.",130,,
579,0.97,3150.914,3153.683,This is a Multibenefit approach.,130,,
580,0.97,3153.683,3154.518,Not a stand alone action.,130,,
581,0.97,3154.518,3161.458,"So for example, some of the recovery actions also might do things to alleviate local flooding.",130,,
582,0.97,3161.458,3172.302,Recognizing the plan is the best available source of science together and using the plan to drive the actions.,130,,
583,0.97,3172.302,3182.646,That is my speedy presentation and matt and I would be happy to take any questions.,130,,
584,0.97,3182.646,3183.28,Thank you very much.,131,,
585,0.97,3183.28,3188.318,We do have a question or comment from Council member Herbold.,131,,
586,0.97,3188.318,3188.618,Thanks.,132,,
587,0.97,3188.618,3195.959,First just want to say how much I've enjoyed serving on this Committee.,132,,
588,0.97,3195.959,3202.532,Since I think 2016 now it's just really great group of folks working together.,132,,
589,0.97,3202.532,3208.371,I feel we've really been able to do some great things.,132,,
590,0.97,3208.371,3265.729,"Perhaps, particularly as it relates to Martha mentioned the focus on investments that are Multibenefit investments that in supporting salmon habitat restoration we can also support the goals around mitigating flood risks and I'm happy to see that sort of our, the values of why we're trying to do that are now being considered by other regional committees like our flood control district and now they too have begun to think more of their investments when focused on flood control can also be--have an additional benefit of protecting salmon habitat or restoring habitat.",132,,
591,0.97,3265.729,3279.876,That's just been a very gratifying sort of collaboration and evolution of the thinking around significant investments in the water shed.,132,,
592,0.97,3279.876,3290.754,But the question I have is related to the frequency of the plan update and I should probably know the answer to this.,132,,
593,0.97,3290.754,3294.424,If I knew I'm not remembering right now.,132,,
594,0.97,3294.424,3296.126,Why don't we update the plan more frequently.,132,,
595,0.97,3296.126,3301.765,I think this is the last time we have updated this plan.,132,,
596,0.97,3301.765,3305.368,I think something like 15 years ago.,132,,
597,0.97,3305.368,3313.81,Seeps like there might be a benefit in a more frequent update.,132,,
598,0.97,3313.81,3332.696,If it would allow us to be able to be more effective and be able to respond in a more real time way to changing conditions associated with climate.,132,,
599,0.97,3332.696,3333.83,"Matt, you want to take that?",133,,
600,0.97,3333.83,3336.499,"Yeah, I can take that.",134,,
601,0.97,3336.499,3337.734,"Yeah, it's a great question.",134,,
602,0.97,3337.734,3344.607,So the original plan was expected to have about a ten year life span.,134,,
603,0.97,3344.607,3355.852,"What we found was that, you know, we ended up not achieving or implementing the number of projects that we had originally hoped at the pace we would.",134,,
604,0.97,3355.852,3365.729,So in fact many of the projects still in the update were conceptual ideas in the 2005 plan.,134,,
605,0.97,3365.729,3374.404,"That being said, what has kind of 10, 15 year expected life span, it's been a living document.",134,,
606,0.97,3374.404,3402.298,So all along there's been amendments made by the watershed Ecosystem forum which is the kind of governing body where should a new project come to light that was not in the plan that we can update it if a given policy is seen to be either a new policy that we need to put in place we've also made changes to policies and a good one being temperatures.,134,,
607,0.97,3402.298,3416.846,About 2018 we started to see that water temperature was increasingly becoming a significant issue with temperatures occasionally getting into the lethal be above the lethal threshold.,134,,
608,0.97,3416.846,3427.924,The committee took action to update a policy related to that and focus additional investments along with repairing and Revegetation.,134,,
609,0.97,3427.924,3429.325,It's a living document.,134,,
610,0.97,3429.325,3429.926,We get more projects.,134,,
611,0.97,3429.926,3434.664,We adjust policy as we move.,134,,
612,0.97,3434.664,3448.678,"The reality is given investment needed to actually turn the dial on fish returns, making any large scale plan changes in a shorter time frame, we just aren't going to see the responses.",134,,
613,0.97,3448.678,3465.261,So that's kind of why the scale is more 10 to 15 years and that scale is seen across Puget sound.,134,,
614,0.97,3465.261,3465.662,"Thanks, matt.",135,,
615,0.97,3465.662,3466.229,Thank you.,135,,
616,0.97,3466.229,3470.633,"Thank you very much, council member Herbold.",136,,
617,0.97,3470.633,3471.334,I have a question.,136,,
618,0.97,3471.334,3490.42,So in terms of the capital projects because obviously the slide with the graph on slide four showing the decline of habitat and recovery will necessitate these capital projects.,136,,
619,0.97,3490.42,3505.301,"Are these capital projects that are mentioned here, are they already in the budget that we approved or will they be put forward in the next capital improvement program that the city council APPROVES next fall?",136,,
620,0.97,3505.301,3508.171,I think it can be a mix.,137,,
621,0.97,3508.171,3511.107,Those projects are not just Seattle's projects.,137,,
622,0.97,3511.107,3516.145,The plan is the capital projects some of them might belong to King County.,137,,
623,0.97,3516.145,3517.547,They would belong to other jurisdictions.,137,,
624,0.97,3517.547,3519.616,Some of them they can be in the current CIP.,137,,
625,0.97,3519.616,3524.721,"They could be in the, you know, moving forward through a CIP process.",137,,
626,0.97,3524.721,3526.256,Some of them not yet.,137,,
627,0.97,3526.256,3532.729,If we have some that are--so some could already in the CIP from Spu or from parks.,137,,
628,0.97,3532.729,3538.668,The other thing is some of the recovery actions are policy oriented.,137,,
629,0.97,3538.668,3544.24,"So around water quality, not just capital.",137,,
630,0.97,3544.24,3549.012,It's not a super linear one for one kind of thing.,137,,
631,0.97,3549.012,3552.215,Thank you for that.,138,,
632,0.97,3552.215,3559.589,I was referring to slide 9 capital projects it says nine Seattle projects for Seattle and city light projects.,138,,
633,0.97,3559.589,3569.332,It would be great to get that information on what's already in the capital improvement program that we just approved and what needs to be approved going forward.,138,,
634,0.97,3569.332,3570.4,Especially as we're changing administrations.,138,,
635,0.97,3570.4,3581.544,That'll be really helpful to make sure we keep this commitment moving forward so we have tangible projects funded to actually address the habitat concerns.,138,,
636,0.97,3581.544,3582.245,That's great.,139,,
637,0.97,3582.245,3586.883,We really appreciate that support and we can get you that information.,139,,
638,0.97,3586.883,3588.051,Great.,140,,
639,0.97,3588.051,3588.351,Thank you.,140,,
640,0.97,3588.351,3602.332,Well Council members I think we're--if we don't have any further questions on this resolution I would move to vote on ratifying this update to the plan.,140,,
641,0.97,3602.332,3602.532,--,141,,
642,0.97,3602.532,3603.967,I'm sorry.,142,,
643,0.97,3603.967,3617.614,I just wanted to before we vote really thank both Martha for staffing me on this body and also thank matt for his leadership.,142,,
644,0.97,3617.614,3623.286,Really enjoy working with both of them.,142,,
645,0.97,3623.286,3630.159,"As mentioned earlier, serving has been quite gratifying.",142,,
646,0.97,3630.159,3637.567,I have not been able to to really express my appreciation to Martha and matt.,142,,
647,0.97,3637.567,3644.707,So really wanted to do so.,142,,
648,0.97,3644.707,3645.274,Thank you.,142,,
649,0.97,3645.274,3645.708,Nice.,143,,
650,0.97,3645.708,3646.042,Thank you.,143,,
651,0.97,3646.042,3658.221,I move that the committee recommend passage of this resolution 32031 item 7 on our agenda.,144,,
652,0.97,3658.221,3658.888,Is there a second?,144,,
653,0.97,3658.888,3659.889,Second been.,145,,
654,0.97,3659.889,3660.89,Thank you.,146,,
655,0.97,3660.89,3661.19,Thank you.,146,,
656,0.97,3661.19,3668.264,It's been moved and Seconded to recommend passage of the resolution.,146,,
657,0.97,3668.264,3668.698,Any final comments?,146,,
658,0.97,3668.698,3669.232,Council member Herbold.,146,,
659,0.97,3669.232,3669.499,Sorry.,147,,
660,0.97,3669.499,3669.966,One other thing too.,147,,
661,0.97,3669.966,3675.605,I should have noted this earlier.,147,,
662,0.97,3675.605,3682.478,There is a mention in the plan for the stewardship position.,147,,
663,0.97,3682.478,3707.203,I think the language might be a little out of date there because it refers I believe to exploring funding for it and I think we're a little bit ahead of the stage of just exploring funding and we've gotten I believe a firm agreement with the parties to contribute to that position.,147,,
664,0.97,3707.203,3720.383,"Do want to recognize that that is included in the plan and again, thank Seattle public utilities for advocating for it and the partners for supporting it as well.",147,,
665,0.97,3720.383,3725.955,Thank you for the clarification on the record.,148,,
666,0.97,3725.955,3729.158,It's been moved and second.,148,,
667,0.97,3729.158,3729.692,Any other final comments?,148,,
668,0.97,3729.692,3740.67,Will the clerk please call the roll on the committee recommendation.,148,,

682,0.97,3769.398,3769.899,"Thank you, everybody.",160,,
683,0.97,3769.899,3770.199,Thank you.,160,,
684,0.97,3770.199,3777.94,Will the clerk read the title of the next agenda item.,161,,
685,0.97,3777.94,3780.443,Agenda item 8. Council bill 120230.,162,,
686,0.97,3780.443,3786.716,"An ordinance relate together city light Department, the Seattle Department of parks and recreation and the Seattle Epartment of transportation.",162,,
687,0.97,3786.716,3794.657,Declaring certain real property rights to be surplus to the needs of city light.,162,,
688,0.97,3794.657,3798.461,"For public hearing, briefing and discussion.",162,,
689,0.97,3798.461,3799.962,Thank you.,163,,
690,0.97,3799.962,3814.677,"So very pleased we're bringing this bill forward as you may recall there have been many Council actions to clean up the title and access to facilitate the Georgetown, the South park and pedestrian and bike trail.",163,,
691,0.97,3814.677,3820.883,Today's bill's final action needed for all the involved Údepartments to proceed with that project.,163,,
692,0.97,3820.883,3836.132,"The project is funded by prior public actions and it's really gratifying to see Seattle city public light, Seattle Department of transportation all work together to bring this project forward.",163,,
693,0.97,3836.132,3842.038,The two utilities involvement included the dedication of a dead end street.,163,,
694,0.97,3842.038,3847.41,That includes significant public benefits along the trails right away including a new dog park.,163,,
695,0.97,3847.41,3850.646,And we can do this a couple different ways.,163,,
696,0.97,3850.646,3852.515,It's a public hearing.,163,,
697,0.97,3852.515,3862.091,So I think we'll go ahead and the items on the agenda I'll go ahead and open and close the public hearing.,163,,
698,0.97,3862.091,3867.797,I just want to check on the speakers here to see if anybody has signed up for this public hearing.,163,,
699,0.97,3867.797,3874.203,I still want to go through the process of opening and closing the public hearing.,163,,
700,0.97,3874.203,3874.604,If Seattle I.T.,163,,
701,0.97,3874.604,3881.444,Can confirm they're not seeing any speakers for this either.,163,,
702,0.97,3881.444,3886.015,Legislative I.T.,164,,
703,0.97,3886.015,3888.017,Sees no public hearing registrants.,164,,
704,0.97,3888.017,3888.918,Thank you.,165,,
705,0.97,3888.918,3889.118,Okay.,165,,
706,0.97,3889.118,3894.523,"Colleagues, I'm going to go through the process here of opening and closing this public hearing as required.",165,,
707,0.97,3894.523,3901.664,The public hearing on Council bill 120-0230 is now open.,165,,
708,0.97,3901.664,3913.175,However there are no speakers signed up and we've confirmed that so I am now closing the public hearing on Council bill 120230.,165,,
709,0.97,3913.175,3917.747,And we will hear from Seattle city light and then ask any questions.,165,,
710,0.97,3917.747,3932.995,"But first before we turn it over to general manager Smith, want to give an opportunity to our central staff Eric Mcconaghy if you have opening remarks on this item.",165,,
711,0.97,3932.995,3933.696,Eric Mcconaghy.,166,,
712,0.97,3933.696,3934.096,Thanksfor asking.,166,,
713,0.97,3934.096,3936.365,I don't have any remarks to add.,166,,
714,0.97,3936.365,3940.469,You covered all the points I would have made.,166,,
715,0.97,3940.469,3941.704,Absent you getting it.,166,,
716,0.97,3941.704,3945.474,The committee is I'm sure familiar with it.,166,,
717,0.97,3945.474,3951.447,There have been interesting presentations and we're about to hear the Wrapup.,166,,
718,0.97,3951.447,3952.148,Looking forward to it.,166,,
719,0.97,3952.148,3954.383,Thank you very much.,167,,
720,0.97,3954.383,3957.086,Welcome to our general manager Ceo Debra Smith.,167,,
721,0.97,3957.086,3959.555,"Hi, thank you so much.",168,,
722,0.97,3959.555,3960.423,Debra Smith.,168,,
723,0.97,3960.423,3961.057,Seattle city light.,168,,
724,0.97,3961.057,3962.124,Thank you for having us.,168,,
725,0.97,3962.124,3974.403,You're going to see a bunch of us today and in the next week or so and we're excited to move a number of important initiatives forward here as we bring this year to a close.,168,,
726,0.97,3974.403,3977.039,"I don't have anything to add either, council member.",168,,
727,0.97,3977.039,3983.546,I think you did a great job and really most folks are probably saying didn't we already do this and the answer is no.,168,,
728,0.97,3983.546,3984.246,This is the exciting part.,168,,
729,0.97,3984.246,3992.555,So I'll turn it other to staff for a short presentation and then we're happy to answer any questions.,168,,
730,0.97,3992.555,3992.955,Thank you.,168,,
731,0.97,3992.955,3993.289,Thank you.,169,,
732,0.97,3993.289,3998.427,I think I'll proceed then if you're ready for that.,170,,
733,0.97,3998.427,4009.271,So this is about transferring a piece of our Georgetown Flume property to parks and to Sdot.,170,,
734,0.97,4009.271,4010.072,Next slide please.,170,,
735,0.97,4010.072,4015.845,So Council members might be thinking as general manager Smith said haven't we done this already.,170,,
736,0.97,4015.845,4018.814,There's been previous legislative action.,170,,
737,0.97,4018.814,4024.086,You authorized basically what amounts to an easement on the property.,170,,
738,0.97,4024.086,4033.596,You authorized temporary easement to resolve piece of building that's from the airport that's encroaching on property.,170,,
739,0.97,4033.596,4044.774,"Then you approve, gave traditional approval for street vacation requests which creates this obligation for city light to make public benefit for street vacations.",170,,
740,0.97,4044.774,4045.608,That was in August.,170,,
741,0.97,4045.608,4046.041,"Next slide, please.",170,,
742,0.97,4046.041,4051.714,So this is the final Council action and what's it do?,170,,
743,0.97,4051.714,4055.684,It declares the property surplus to our needs which is a necessary step.,170,,
744,0.97,4055.684,4058.587,We're making a minor correction to King County's temporary easement.,170,,
745,0.97,4058.587,4062.291,We need to make an adjustment there.,170,,
746,0.97,4062.291,4068.998,It transfers the jurisdiction of the two portions of the property to parks and Sdot.,170,,
747,0.97,4068.998,4076.472,"It checks the box for one of the major requirements for our, what you approved of Street vacations.",170,,
748,0.97,4076.472,4078.541,This will be a big part of the public benefit.,170,,
749,0.97,4078.541,4084.213,Our funding with the other departments would be the other main part.,170,,
750,0.97,4084.213,4096.659,Then this allows parks and Sdot to go ahead and finish design and construct and that's projected for construction in middle of next year on this property.,170,,
751,0.97,4096.659,4098.561,I think that's it.,170,,
752,0.97,4098.561,4098.894,Next slide?,170,,
753,0.97,4098.894,4099.161,Oh Yeah.,170,,
754,0.97,4099.161,4099.361,Yes.,170,,
755,0.97,4099.361,4108.17,There's just a reminder of the location we're at the Northwest corner of Boeing field.,170,,
756,0.97,4108.17,4114.877,In between myrtle and East marginal way South in the Georgetown neighborhood.,170,,
757,0.97,4114.877,4115.211,Next please.,170,,
758,0.97,4115.211,4117.279,And those are the two parcels.,170,,
759,0.97,4117.279,4126.055,The skinny part going to Sdot for the trail and the larger portion going to parts for the off leash area.,170,,
760,0.97,4126.055,4126.589,I think that's it.,170,,
761,0.97,4126.589,4127.99,"Next, please.",170,,
762,0.97,4127.99,4128.19,Oh.,170,,
763,0.97,4128.19,4141.804,Then just to remind you this is the conceptual view of what's going to be developed there on what's basically an unused vacant industrial lot right now.,170,,
764,0.97,4141.804,4142.137,Next please.,170,,
765,0.97,4142.137,4142.438,That's it.,170,,
766,0.97,4142.438,4145.341,We're glad to take any questions of Council members.,170,,
767,0.97,4145.341,4147.977,"Council member, if if I might just to comment.",171,,
768,0.97,4147.977,4152.781,This is something that the community is really excited about.,171,,
769,0.97,4152.781,4154.95,I want to say it's been a real pleasure.,171,,
770,0.97,4154.95,4158.754,Staff has done an amazing job working together.,171,,
771,0.97,4158.754,4168.13,"I think Sdot parks, city light, this was important to all of us.",171,,
772,0.97,4168.13,4172.268,This is one of the first parts that will be fully implemented.,171,,
773,0.97,4172.268,4187.216,We're just so pleased that despite 2020 and the challenges we face that we're able to pull this together in a way that together with the Georgetown steam plant we're starting to make a difference in an area where making a difference really matters.,171,,
774,0.97,4187.216,4187.583,How about that.,171,,
775,0.97,4187.583,4197.293,So thank you very much for your time and consideration of this item.,171,,
776,0.97,4197.293,4198.36,Thank you.,172,,
777,0.97,4198.36,4203.032,From our perspective it's been flawless collaboration among different departments.,172,,
778,0.97,4203.032,4219.782,So appreciate all your hard work to move this forward and I know I'm sure Council members Morales and Herbold are also excited about this one and I hope I can bring my dog down to this Park when it's done.,172,,
779,0.97,4219.782,4221.817,"So Council members, any questions?",172,,
780,0.97,4221.817,4223.252,We're going to vote on this.,172,,
781,0.97,4223.252,4237.633,We're going to vote on it next meeting on December 15 but if there are no final questions we can just move on to the next item.,172,,
782,0.97,4237.633,4237.933,All right.,172,,
783,0.97,4237.933,4241.437,I do not see any questions at this time.,172,,
784,0.97,4241.437,4246.742,So we will vote this out of committee I imagine on December 15th.,172,,
785,0.97,4246.742,4249.511,"Thank you, everybody for being here from city light.",172,,
786,0.97,4249.511,4256.485,We've got an item for you next as well.,172,,
787,0.97,4256.485,4264.994,Will the clerk read the short tithe L of the next ago item into the record.,172,,
788,0.97,4264.994,4266.629,Ago item 9. Council bill 120233.,173,,
789,0.97,4266.629,4278.641,An ordinance relating to the city light Department directing the transfer of certain funds in the light fund into the rate stabilization account in 2021.,173,,
790,0.97,4278.641,4284.813,"For briefing, discussion and possible vote.",173,,
791,0.97,4284.813,4286.649,Thank you.,174,,
792,0.97,4286.649,4288.35,I'm really impressed with this ordinance.,174,,
793,0.97,4288.35,4300.729,I think when we hear about it it'll be obvious what a great Proactive job city light did here in getting ahead of this and protecting rate payers to keep rates as affordable as possible.,174,,
794,0.97,4300.729,4311.54,I do want to open it up to our central staff Eric Mcconaghy if you have any opening remarks about this.,174,,
795,0.97,4311.54,4311.907,Thank you.,175,,
796,0.97,4311.907,4312.107,Yeah.,175,,
797,0.97,4312.107,4321.45,Just to say very light background because I'm sure that Chris and the other folks will give a great presentation.,175,,
798,0.97,4321.45,4324.219,The key things for folks to understand.,175,,
799,0.97,4324.219,4326.755,This is about the rate stabilization account.,175,,
800,0.97,4326.755,4329.692,It was set up in 2004.,175,,
801,0.97,4329.692,4330.392,It's in municipal code.,175,,
802,0.97,4330.392,4338.233,It serves to smooth out fluctuations for revenues coming into the city light Fund from the sale of power.,175,,
803,0.97,4338.233,4347.376,"City light as folks I think know SELLS retail power to folks that run gas stations, grocery stores, people at home.",175,,
804,0.97,4347.376,4356.919,"They also sell wholesale power to other utilities, and those revenues can go up or down compared to what's planned for.",175,,
805,0.97,4356.919,4359.321,The Rsa hopes to smooth that out.,175,,
806,0.97,4359.321,4362.024,There's a structure to do that that's in the code.,175,,
807,0.97,4362.024,4365.127,You'll hear about proposals to make adjustments there.,175,,
808,0.97,4365.127,4383.946,The primary thing I think the real thing that brought this to Council today is permission for the utility to make a transfer of some funds from the light fund to the Rsa before the end of the year to prevent a surcharge from being put on customers bills.,175,,
809,0.97,4383.946,4390.552,"That would be consistent with the Council, utility and the Mayor's goal to keep things stable for customers.",175,,
810,0.97,4390.552,4397.259,With that hopefully without stealing too much fire from the Presenters I'll be done.,175,,
811,0.97,4397.259,4397.493,Thanks.,175,,
812,0.97,4397.493,4399.361,Excellent summary.,176,,
813,0.97,4399.361,4405.968,We'll turn it over to general manager of Seattle city light Debra Smith.,176,,
814,0.97,4405.968,4406.402,Thanks again.,177,,
815,0.97,4406.402,4409.605,I'll keep my comments short as well.,177,,
816,0.97,4409.605,4416.879,I just want to recognize and appreciate Eric for his help in making this happen and bringing this home.,177,,
817,0.97,4416.879,4435.631,I want to appreciate the city budget office who worked with us very closely in developing the concept and I really want to just introduce to you Kirsty Grainger and Chris Ruffini.,177,,
818,0.97,4435.631,4439.601,We hope that you'll be open to this option.,177,,
819,0.97,4439.601,4441.436,We're here to answer questions.,177,,
820,0.97,4441.436,4452.548,"As Eric mentioned, I think the one thing I want to be clear about is that we need to take action on this prior to year end in order to keep the surcharge there triggering.",177,,
821,0.97,4452.548,4457.619,With that I'll turn it over to Kirsty and Chris.,177,,
822,0.97,4457.619,4459.621,Good morning.,178,,
823,0.97,4459.621,4462.291,Thank you for your time today.,178,,
824,0.97,4462.291,4474.837,I'll be doing the presentation and Kirsty will keep me in line if I say anything incorrect.,178,,
825,0.97,4474.837,4475.237,Next slide.,178,,
826,0.97,4475.237,4479.308,The legislation pertains to the rate stabilization count.,178,,
827,0.97,4479.308,4493.922,"As Eric indicated earlier, the Rsa is a restricted cash reserve that city light uses to ensure we have enough revenue to fund our operations despite uncertainty in the wholesale power market.",178,,
828,0.97,4493.922,4502.431,"If it gets depleted meaning we are not selling as much wholesale power as expected, automatic rate surcharges come on and Refill it.",178,,
829,0.97,4502.431,4511.34,Those rules are set by ordinance and that is an SMC 214986 for anybody who is interested in that.,178,,
830,0.97,4511.34,4520.916,As you may remember we were in front of you earlier this year regarding the Rsa and 21 and 22 rates.,178,,
831,0.97,4520.916,4532.995,"With your approval, city light replaced a 3% Rsa surcharge that was due to roll off earlier this year with a 3% rate increase resulting in no change to customer bills in this 2021.",178,,
832,0.97,4532.995,4535.497,We did this to open sure some rate stability.,178,,
833,0.97,4535.497,4538.934,So we didn't see a large increase.,178,,
834,0.97,4538.934,4541.837,Customers didn't see a large increase for 2022.,178,,
835,0.97,4541.837,4545.507,We'll cover it in more detail in the next slide.,178,,
836,0.97,4545.507,4550.245,Since we were here there have been changes to the financial picture.,178,,
837,0.97,4550.245,4551.146,That's why we're here.,178,,
838,0.97,4551.146,4556.818,As Eric indicated the legislation proposes two amendments to the Rsa.,178,,
839,0.97,4556.818,4565.227,First a cash deposit from the operating fund into the Rsa to avoid triggering a surcharge.,178,,
840,0.97,4565.227,4571.6,"Secondly, it would authorize changes to the rules that would make it more customer friendly.",178,,
841,0.97,4571.6,4582.077,If passed it will enable us to keep our promise to customers which is that we wouldn't raise rates in 2021.,178,,
842,0.97,4582.077,4583.412,Next slide.,178,,
843,0.97,4583.412,4588.784,"Orienting you to the slide, the bar chart shows city light's revenues from surplus power sales.",178,,
844,0.97,4588.784,4597.726,Everything above the X axis is where the value of the energy we sell is greater than the cost of the energy we buy.,178,,
845,0.97,4597.726,4601.964,Under normal Hydro conditions city light produces more power than we need.,178,,
846,0.97,4601.964,4606.268,And we sell that surplus on the wholesale market.,178,,
847,0.97,4606.268,4608.47,This extra revenue helps keep our rates low.,178,,
848,0.97,4608.47,4611.74,You can see the yellow bars are positive.,178,,
849,0.97,4611.74,4614.81,Blue bars are the Actuals as well as our forecast for the rest of the year.,178,,
850,0.97,4614.81,4623.051,You can see from the blue bar Wes had strong revenue January through March.,178,,
851,0.97,4623.051,4627.589,Which was when we lifted that SRA surcharge earlier.,178,,
852,0.97,4627.589,4630.592,From April through August the revenue came in well short of our budget.,178,,
853,0.97,4630.592,4632.894,There were two reasons for this.,178,,
854,0.97,4632.894,4642.304,The first 2021 has been a really unusual weather weather year.,178,,
855,0.97,4642.304,4650.379,For city light the drought meant low Hydro electric generation.,178,,
856,0.97,4650.379,4661.89,Through the summer city lights in the market rather than selling we were buying at a time when the region was in short supply and prices were expensive.,178,,
857,0.97,4661.89,4666.862,The other contributing factor is kind of a good news bad news thing.,178,,
858,0.97,4666.862,4672.034,Besides weather our retail demand that's been higher than we planned for.,178,,
859,0.97,4672.034,4673.301,This is good news.,178,,
860,0.97,4673.301,4680.242,Higher demand for electricity from our businesses and residents is an indicator of economic recovery.,178,,
861,0.97,4680.242,4686.648,It helps city light's bottom line which we'll discuss next.,178,,
862,0.97,4686.648,4691.453,We had less emergency available to sell.,178,,
863,0.97,4691.453,4702.931,Combination of these two things means that city light indicates to come in about $35 million short on our $60 million budget for 2021 for wholesale revenue.,178,,
864,0.97,4702.931,4708.37,To make up for this short fall the Rsa has been drawn down.,178,,
865,0.97,4708.37,4711.44,It's been drawn down pretty quickly.,178,,
866,0.97,4711.44,4724.186,"Even though the Rsa was full at 100 million, by the end of September it's down to 82 million which for the operating rules would trigger the first 1.5% surcharge.",178,,
867,0.97,4724.186,4732.828,We don't believe that the surcharge is necessary which is why we're bringing this legislation to you today.,178,,
868,0.97,4732.828,4742.571,"Next slide while the wholesale revenue scenario is not good, our overall picture is excellent.",178,,
869,0.97,4742.571,4746.174,Nearly $27 million more than we planned.,178,,
870,0.97,4746.174,4752.08,We've had some favorable purchase power costs from our bulk power sources.,178,,
871,0.97,4752.08,4759.387,And we also had some help from low interest rates and long term debt refinancing we did earlier this year.,178,,
872,0.97,4759.387,4767.195,Our bottom line financial target is to have a debt service coverage ratio of 1.8 times.,178,,
873,0.97,4767.195,4785.58,In short what this means is that we have enough operating cash to deposit some of that--some of those funds back into Rsa.,178,,
874,0.97,4785.58,4789.151,Section next slide please.,178,,
875,0.97,4789.151,4790.852,The proposed legislation allows city light.,178,,
876,0.97,4790.852,4801.93,So long as we maintain a 1.85 times debt service coverage ratio.,178,,
877,0.97,4801.93,4810.605,The legislation modifies the rules.,178,,
878,0.97,4810.605,4822.083,This legislation actually proposes to allow city light to only trigger surcharges twice a year whereas currently into the rules and operation today we could do it quarterly.,178,,
879,0.97,4822.083,4825.287,Someone could have a rate change four times a year.,178,,
880,0.97,4825.287,4828.39,We're proposing at most two.,178,,
881,0.97,4828.39,4838.099,This legislation also proposes fewer surcharge steps and leaves those surcharges in place until the Rsa fully Refills.,178,,
882,0.97,4838.099,4847.776,In the past a new surcharge and incremental surcharge would be triggered every time we're $10 million worse than we thought we were before.,178,,
883,0.97,4847.776,4849.978,"They would trigger at 90, 80, 70.",178,,
884,0.97,4849.978,4859.921,We're proposing they trigger a little lower at a slightly higher percentage and stay on until the Rsa Refills.,178,,
885,0.97,4859.921,4861.723,Really driving home that rate stability.,178,,
886,0.97,4861.723,4872.834,With this legislation just want to say the cash transfer is Reactive and we really need to take that action in 2021.,178,,
887,0.97,4872.834,4874.936,The proposed rule amendments are really Proactive.,178,,
888,0.97,4874.936,4881.009,They reflect what we've learned over the decade of observing the Rsa in action.,178,,
889,0.97,4881.009,4886.615,We can make the Rsa less dynamic and still have it be effective.,178,,
890,0.97,4886.615,4895.523,Exchanges will provide city light with financial resilience we need to keep our rates low and sustainable for years to come.,178,,
891,0.97,4895.523,4902.664,That's the end of this presentation and happy to take any questions you may have.,178,,
892,0.97,4902.664,4906.935,Hopefully I didn't talk too fast.,178,,
893,0.97,4906.935,4907.535,This was excellent.,179,,
894,0.97,4907.535,4911.973,This is one of my favorite power point presentations of the year.,179,,
895,0.97,4911.973,4916.912,This is why you Tillties are exciting.,179,,
896,0.97,4916.912,4918.446,Because they were Proactive.,179,,
897,0.97,4918.446,4933.662,They're literally saving hubs of thousands of rate payers money and not only just a one time fix for this challenge but also changing the baseline legislation to smooth it out.,179,,
898,0.97,4933.662,4937.899,To learn from the past decade of the Rsa in action.,179,,
899,0.97,4937.899,4947.676,I just want to commend everybody at City light involved with this and also central staff for bringing this forward.,179,,
900,0.97,4947.676,4955.65,I definitely support getting this done this year so we can have it put into action to benefit rate payers.,179,,
901,0.97,4955.65,4970.632,"Council members, any questions about this rate stabilization ordinance?",179,,
902,0.97,4970.632,4973.935,I'll go ahead and move this forward.,179,,
903,0.97,4973.935,4979.541,I'd like to move that the city committee passage of Council bill 120233.,179,,

927,0.97,5053.515,5059.521,"What we are experiencing right now is the ability to use it truly to benefit our customers, which was the intent.",194,,
928,0.97,5059.521,5076.538,So I just want to appreciate past councils who helped get us to a place where we could in fact mitigate for this rate action through use of the funds transfer.,194,,

939,0.97,5119.647,5122.35,Thank you.,197,,
940,0.97,5122.35,5142.67,"This resolution as I understand it state law adopted in 2006 requires Seattle city light to establish renew energy and energy efficient targets based on available conservation information and cost effective, reliable and feasible.",197,,
941,0.97,5142.67,5147.575,The utility must report by Encorrally.,197,,
942,0.97,5147.575,5153.548,This would approve city light's targets.,197,,

962,0.97,5246.507,5251.145,Related to this in terms of conservation and energy.,200,,
963,0.97,5251.145,5253.114,That's another day.,200,,
964,0.97,5253.114,5254.215,For now that's it.,200,,

969,0.97,5264.459,5265.293,"Thank you, chair.",202,,
970,0.97,5265.293,5269.23,I want to introduce what I'll call the dream team.,202,,
971,0.97,5269.23,5275.737,Kali and Jennifer know the material in and outside.,202,,
972,0.97,5275.737,5278.306,The one thing Craig Smith of course is here with me as well.,202,,
973,0.97,5278.306,5283.878,I want to call out Robert Cromwell.,202,,
974,0.97,5283.878,5286.648,Robert is one of my favorite pinch hitters.,202,,
975,0.97,5286.648,5295.657,He's currently serving as our director in charge of customer energy solutions which is why he's here.,202,,
976,0.97,5295.657,5302.096,Robert in the past as some might recall led our power planning team.,202,,
977,0.97,5302.096,5302.697,He led customer operations.,202,,
978,0.97,5302.697,5308.369,He's a very well rounded utility executive.,202,,
979,0.97,5308.369,5323.184,"I think what is really important about the work is while Seattle has always been a leader in the industry, Seattle is the grandfather of energy efficiency.",202,,
980,0.97,5323.184,5325.153,Which is something to be very proud of.,202,,
981,0.97,5325.153,5332.86,"What we're seeing now is as we move into Electrify case, we move into demand response.",202,,
982,0.97,5332.86,5343.004,We move into how do we use energy efficiency and savings as a way of creating capacity versus pure energy.,202,,
983,0.97,5343.004,5350.445,Robert's history on the power side brings that perspective directly to CES.,202,,
984,0.97,5350.445,5352.48,What is a very critical time.,202,,
985,0.97,5352.48,5355.016,That's not the nature of today's conversation.,202,,
986,0.97,5355.016,5361.222,I wanted to take an opportunity to introduce him in his new role and help create that connection to the future.,202,,
987,0.97,5361.222,5376.371,"As we talk about utility of the future and we look at the funding opportunities that are becoming available both through infrastructure and through the continuing resolution, we are going to see a lot of money becoming available for expanded types of energy efficiency and Robert's smiling.",202,,
988,0.97,5376.371,5385.346,He knows that he's Tasked me with trying to find the resources he needs to deliver that money to our community.,202,,
989,0.97,5385.346,5387.782,With that I'm going to turn it over to the team.,202,,
990,0.97,5387.782,5393.087,Thank you very much again.,202,,
991,0.97,5393.087,5393.588,Good morning.,203,,
992,0.97,5393.588,5402.897,I'm Jennifer Finnigan and I'm presenting with Kali Hollenhorst.,203,,
993,0.97,5402.897,5404.399,The 22-23 conservation target.,203,,
994,0.97,5404.399,5405.366,"Next slide, please.",203,,
995,0.97,5405.366,5408.302,So Kali and I believe in putting our ask up front.,203,,
996,0.97,5408.302,5409.67,Here it is.,203,,
997,0.97,5409.67,5417.845,The reason we're here today is to soar your approval of city light's conservation target for 2022 and 23.,203,,
998,0.97,5417.845,5424.285,"As you heard, every two years Seattle city light presents our conservation targets to city Council and we gain your approval.",203,,
999,0.97,5424.285,5426.654,This is the seventh time we have done this.,203,,
1000,0.97,5426.654,5431.659,"Wait a second, what's a conservation target?",203,,
1001,0.97,5431.659,5441.135,"A conservation target is the amount of conservation that Seattle city light will acquire by offering rebates, incentives and market interventions.",203,,
1002,0.97,5441.135,5447.275,This is the amount of conservation we will acquire in a two year and ten year period.,203,,
1003,0.97,5447.275,5457.218,So our recommended target is for two years is 18.7 average mega watts.,203,,
1004,0.97,5457.218,5465.827,"And this is equivalent to 23,000 homes that average energy use of 23,000 Seattle residential homes.",203,,
1005,0.97,5465.827,5470.665,The recommended ten year target is 76.9.,203,,
1006,0.97,5470.665,5477.905,Initiative 937 passed in 2006 requires governing bodies like you to approve targets every two years.,203,,
1007,0.97,5477.905,5483.544,So before I go on to the next slide there are a couple notes.,203,,
1008,0.97,5483.544,5485.246,Our later slides go into more detail.,203,,
1009,0.97,5485.246,5487.849,This is just our ask up front.,203,,
1010,0.97,5487.849,5490.518,We'll be explaining how we go the to these numbers in a little bit.,203,,
1011,0.97,5490.518,5502.997,The other thing I wanted to say before I go on to the next slide is that Kali and I are going to use the terms conservation and energy efficiency Interchangeably.,203,,
1012,0.97,5502.997,5509.103,Just know those mean the same things in this presentation.,203,,
1013,0.97,5509.103,5509.537,"Next slide, please.",203,,
1014,0.97,5509.537,5513.908,So we have nine slides for you and we have three sections.,203,,
1015,0.97,5513.908,5516.911,The first section is an introduction to conservation.,203,,
1016,0.97,5516.911,5519.347,This is why we offer it.,203,,
1017,0.97,5519.347,5524.785,This is what we offer and this is a conservation at City light 101.,203,,
1018,0.97,5524.785,5528.256,The second section is the reason we're here today.,203,,
1019,0.97,5528.256,5531.759,This is the conservation target for 2022 and 23.,203,,
1020,0.97,5531.759,5535.029,This is what we're asking you to approve.,203,,
1021,0.97,5535.029,5544.572,"In this sixth we'll be discussing how we calculated these targets, what this entails and what it is.",203,,
1022,0.97,5544.572,5549.777,"Lastly, the third section is an explanation about what the target means for city light.",203,,
1023,0.97,5549.777,5558.786,So I'm now going to hand the microphone to my colleague Kali.,203,,
1024,0.97,5558.786,5559.053,Great.,204,,
1025,0.97,5559.053,5559.287,Thanks.,204,,
1026,0.97,5559.287,5566.26,I thought I would start off by giving some background on the conservation at Seattle city light.,204,,
1027,0.97,5566.26,5570.631,Seattle city light has a long stemming commitment to conservation.,204,,
1028,0.97,5570.631,5578.406,It is really Foundational to how we run but our utility.,204,,
1029,0.97,5578.406,5581.909,We have a long history of conservation at Seattle city light.,204,,
1030,0.97,5581.909,5593.988,We started running our programs back in 1977 and this makes one of--this makes us one of the longest running utility conservation programs in the country.,204,,
1031,0.97,5593.988,5605.466,We offer savings across a portfolio of services and offerings that are offered to all of our customer classes.,204,,
1032,0.97,5605.466,5614.675,Conservation projects have been stalled in residential commercial and industrial facilities throughout our service territory.,204,,
1033,0.97,5614.675,5620.815,So Seattle city light views conservation as a resource and we value conservation for several reasons.,204,,
1034,0.97,5620.815,5633.461,But including because it's a low cost resource it's a low risk resource and because it has low environmental impacts but including no greenhouse gas emissions.,204,,
1035,0.97,5633.461,5642.436,And so by Prioritizing the conservation we have successfully deferred the acquisition of new resources.,204,,
1036,0.97,5642.436,5645.106,And conservation Helpstous maintain our status.,204,,
1037,0.97,5645.106,5652.947,Which we all know will become increasingly important in the future.,204,,
1038,0.97,5652.947,5653.447,"Next slide, please.",204,,
1039,0.97,5653.447,5658.786,So what is a potential assessment and why do we do them?,204,,
1040,0.97,5658.786,5674.201,"A potential assessment is a year long study that identifies the amount, the timing and cost of energy, conservation within the Seattle city light service territory across the next 20 years.",204,,
1041,0.97,5674.201,5680.441,It is ultimately used to inform and set our conservation goals.,204,,
1042,0.97,5680.441,5682.209,As has been mentioned before.,204,,
1043,0.97,5682.209,5693.754,Requires that utilities identify and pursue all available conservation that is cost effective and then set your targets on to your cycles.,204,,
1044,0.97,5693.754,5715.376,Then in addition the clean energy transformation act commits Washington to supply of greenhouse gas free power by 45 and requires that utilities set four year targets for conservation.,204,,
1045,0.97,5715.376,5737.331,"So although we are required by Washington state law to do potential assessments we also use them as inputs to our integrated resource plan, our load forecast and also it helps to inform what we offer to our customers.",204,,
1046,0.97,5737.331,5738.632,"So next slide, please.",204,,
1047,0.97,5738.632,5738.866,Great.,204,,
1048,0.97,5738.866,5739.1,Thanks.,204,,
1049,0.97,5739.1,5751.512,So Jennifer showed these numbers before but this table shows the two and 10 year targets we are required to share for by 37.,204,,
1050,0.97,5751.512,5754.582,Our two year target is 18.7.,204,,
1051,0.97,5754.582,5758.419,Average mega watts.,204,,
1052,0.97,5758.419,5760.421,Ten year target is 76.9.,204,,
1053,0.97,5760.421,5777.037,"This is our Seventh potential assessment, so before I compare these numbers to what I presented to you last time, I thought it would be helpful to review what has changed since 2020.",204,,
1054,0.97,5777.037,5777.471,"Next slide, please.",204,,
1055,0.97,5777.471,5786.981,So there are a few things that has changed and are making potentially go up and go down.,204,,
1056,0.97,5786.981,5792.753,First we're seeing lower potential in CPA than compared to the prior CPA.,204,,
1057,0.97,5792.753,5796.924,"Or another way, there's less savings out there for us to go and get.",204,,
1058,0.97,5796.924,5804.665,Some of the main drivers include our long history of conservation.,204,,
1059,0.97,5804.665,5814.542,The huge transformation in the lighting market that we've seen across the past 10 to 15 years and also because we can claim savings just for the savings above code.,204,,
1060,0.97,5814.542,5818.245,Stricter codes and standards are making it harder for us to go and get savings.,204,,
1061,0.97,5818.245,5832.893,The second point I want to make on this slide is is of the savings that remain they tend to be more costly but then the savings we were seeing in the prior CPA.,204,,
1062,0.97,5832.893,5846.907,The reason is much of the low hanging fruit or the cheaper savings like those associated with lighting has already been done or is captured through codes and standards.,204,,
1063,0.97,5846.907,5867.628,And then the last point is that the Washington state law lays out two Methodologies to identify potential and the first approach which could be use the in the last CPA is done at a slightly higher level and is less detailed than the second approach which we shifted to in the CPA.,204,,
1064,0.97,5867.628,5874.268,The second approach values conservation within city light's integrated resource plan.,204,,
1065,0.97,5874.268,5878.606,Slightly more Nuanced model and is better able to reflect the benefits of conservation.,204,,
1066,0.97,5878.606,5889.35,What we saw is with the second model we were seeing higher amounts of conservation than with the first model.,204,,
1067,0.97,5889.35,5894.355,Capture all of the benefits of conservation.,204,,
1068,0.97,5894.355,5902.296,With this context let's compare the results of this CPA with the last CPA we shared in 2020.,204,,
1069,0.97,5902.296,5903.864,If you go to the next slide.,204,,
1070,0.97,5903.864,5908.802,This is slide is looking at the two year targets of this study.,204,,
1071,0.97,5908.802,5916.577,Right hand side to the previous study we presented in 2020.,204,,
1072,0.97,5916.577,5924.084,The total potential has decreased by about 12% for reasons that I just discussed.,204,,
1073,0.97,5924.084,5933.961,The break out between the sectors is roughly the same so we are continuing to see commercial savings continue to be the most potential.,204,,
1074,0.97,5933.961,5947.841,So with that I think I'm going to pass the Mic back to Jennifer to wrap us up and talk about what these results mean for us going forward.,204,,
1075,0.97,5947.841,5948.309,Thank you.,205,,
1076,0.97,5948.309,5970.03,So we just heard that Seattle city light is recommending a two year conservation target of 18.7 average mega Wallets and at the very beginning we saw Debra say that conservation at City light we are a grandfather.,205,,
1077,0.97,5970.03,5977.471,"We have a long, strong history of conservation at City light.",205,,
1078,0.97,5977.471,5981.342,Our commitment to conservation remains strong.,205,,
1079,0.97,5981.342,5983.577,Weir continue to deliver programs.,205,,
1080,0.97,5983.577,5986.447,Energy efficiency as a service.,205,,
1081,0.97,5986.447,5987.848,Offerings for small business.,205,,
1082,0.97,5987.848,5990.084,But the world is changing.,205,,
1083,0.97,5990.084,5991.418,And we're changing too.,205,,
1084,0.97,5991.418,6002.663,So that means in the future we will be increasingly offering conservation programs and incentives that are targeted seasonally.,205,,
1085,0.97,6002.663,6009.169,In earlier presentations you saw Chris talk about how we had to pay more for energy in summer and winter.,205,,
1086,0.97,6009.169,6018.245,There are ways that we can offer targeted I incentives in December and January and in July and August.,205,,
1087,0.97,6018.245,6022.683,We will also be offering targeted incentives geographically too.,205,,
1088,0.97,6022.683,6028.889,Particularly to those communities and areas that haven't been able to participate as often.,205,,
1089,0.97,6028.889,6033.827,We'll also be bundling conservation with demand response and Electrify case.,205,,
1090,0.97,6033.827,6038.699,The need to be focusing on capacity early on.,205,,
1091,0.97,6038.699,6053.847,A way of talking about that what demand response is is we can offer incentives for people to turn down their thermostats an their hot water heaters when the grid is in big need.,205,,
1092,0.97,6053.847,6064.558,Essentially there's a way for us to be offering incentives called demand response at those times and lump those together with energy efficiency incentives.,205,,
1093,0.97,6064.558,6070.397,We can provide incentives for those smart thermostats and smart water heaters.,205,,
1094,0.97,6070.397,6075.502,Of course we will also be developing customer tools to manage energy use.,205,,
1095,0.97,6075.502,6082.509,"You've heard a lot in the past about advance metering infrastructure, AMI or smart meters.",205,,
1096,0.97,6082.509,6087.448,We're collecting a lot of data about how customers use their energy.,205,,
1097,0.97,6087.448,6101.295,We are developing tools that enable and educate customers and their energy use and how they can best make the most of it by saving money and using energy at times that are most beneficial to them and the grid.,205,,
1098,0.97,6101.295,6105.666,"And Lastly, but not Leastly, this is what we want to end our NOTE on.",205,,
1099,0.97,6105.666,6110.27,Is that we are listening to customer and community voices.,205,,
1100,0.97,6110.27,6114.575,Especially as we define and refine our programs.,205,,
1101,0.97,6114.575,6118.145,We are a public utility and we're focused on our community.,205,,
1102,0.97,6118.145,6123.25,Our mission is to partner with customers to meet their energy needs.,205,,
1103,0.97,6123.25,6132.226,That means improving customer experience by talking with community members as we design and refine our programs.,205,,
1104,0.97,6132.226,6136.964,Thank you and we'd love to entertain your questions.,205,,
1105,0.97,6136.964,6141.135,Thank you very much for that presentation.,206,,
1106,0.97,6141.135,6141.835,Thanks for explaining.,206,,
1107,0.97,6141.835,6149.676,Appreciate the transparency in explaining the targets Trending down because you've got the low hanging fruit there.,206,,
1108,0.97,6149.676,6158.986,Want to see if colleagues have any questions for Seattle city light on this resolution.,206,,
1109,0.97,6158.986,6160.387,"Yes, general manager Smith.",206,,
1110,0.97,6160.387,6160.654,Go ahead.,206,,
1111,0.97,6160.654,6161.121,Thanks.,207,,
1112,0.97,6161.121,6170.397,I just wanted to make one more comment and I want to acknowledge something really big that happened this week.,207,,
1113,0.97,6170.397,6175.335,That probably isn't on your radar and connect it to this work.,207,,
1114,0.97,6175.335,6197.791,"Last weekend over Thanksgiving weekend Seattle I.T., Seattle city light and Seattle public utilities worked all weekend to complete an upgrade to our customer care and billing system and what we call our metered out of management system which now has a different Acronym because it's in the cloud and that was the big change.",207,,
1115,0.97,6197.791,6202.563,That is the two first components of what we call fusion.,207,,
1116,0.97,6202.563,6219.78,"The third which will happen in Q 1, end of Q 1 beginning of Q 2 of 2022 is to complete the integration of Seattle city light's AMI system to the CCB system.",207,,
1117,0.97,6219.78,6223.25,So this was a huge project that was really hard to get over the finish line.,207,,
1118,0.97,6223.25,6226.954,In the end the conversion of the flawless.,207,,
1119,0.97,6226.954,6233.393,Many folks said it was the best large system conversion the city's done in a long time.,207,,
1120,0.97,6233.393,6235.028,Kudos to everyone involved in that.,207,,
1121,0.97,6235.028,6245.005,That's relevant here because to Jennifer's point what that's going to do for us when we get to next spring is we'll have the ability to offer those time of day prices.,207,,
1122,0.97,6245.005,6249.743,"We talked about this, I talked about this with Council members.",207,,
1123,0.97,6249.743,6252.479,I know Council member Herbold and others.,207,,
1124,0.97,6252.479,6257.384,When I first got here three years ago.,207,,
1125,0.97,6257.384,6270.497,"We are at the point where very soon, probably January 1 of 2023 we'll be in a position to offer new pricing models that provide the kinds of incentives that Jennifer was just talking about.",207,,
1126,0.97,6270.497,6287.214,"I wanted to make you aware of what happened over Thanksgiving weekend and let you know how that connects to this, again, a lot of what we're doing is about utility next 2.0 and how we become a utility of the future.",207,,
1127,0.97,6287.214,6288.982,This is a big piece of it.,207,,
1128,0.97,6288.982,6290.15,Thank you.,207,,
1129,0.97,6290.15,6291.618,Thank you for mentioning that.,208,,
1130,0.97,6291.618,6295.555,Thanks to everybody who worked on that.,208,,
1131,0.97,6295.555,6295.956,Appreciate that.,208,,
1132,0.97,6295.956,6305.165,"Colleagues, any questions about this resolution on the conservation targets?",208,,
1133,0.97,6305.165,6310.203,Because this is a resolution it happens every two years and it's a statement requirement.,208,,
1134,0.97,6310.203,6313.24,We are here at the end of the year.,208,,
1135,0.97,6313.24,6318.512,I would like to--I know city light would like us to pass it out of committee today.,208,,
1136,0.97,6318.512,6326.787,Because it's a public hearing that requires suspension of our rules.,208,,
1137,0.97,6326.787,6327.387,Public hearing legislation.,208,,
1138,0.97,6327.387,6335.896,"So if there's no objection, colleagues, we would vote on this legislation the same day.",208,,
1139,0.97,6335.896,6341.301,We'll go ahead and suspend the rules.,208,,
1140,0.97,6341.301,6341.535,Okay.,208,,
1141,0.97,6341.535,6348.275,Hearing no objection this could be sill rule was suspended and the committee will proceed to a vote on this resolution.,208,,
1142,0.97,6348.275,6358.452,I now move that the committee recommend passage of resolution 32030.,208,,
1143,0.97,6358.452,6360.454,Is there a second?,208,,
1144,0.97,6360.454,6361.655,Second.,209,,
1145,0.97,6361.655,6361.955,Second.,210,,
1146,0.97,6361.955,6366.493,It's been moved and Seconded to recommend approval.,211,,
1147,0.97,6366.493,6371.198,Will the clerk please call the roll?,211,,

1161,0.97,6387.914,6394.855,The motion carries and the committee recommendation will be sent to the December 6th city council meeting.,223,,
1162,0.97,6394.855,6395.055,Okay.,223,,
1163,0.97,6395.055,6398.058,"General manager Smith, you have your hand up.",223,,
1164,0.97,6398.058,6398.892,Did you have anything else?,223,,
1165,0.97,6398.892,6402.095,I forgot to take it down.,224,,
