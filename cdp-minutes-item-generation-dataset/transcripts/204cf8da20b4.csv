43,0.97,318.851,327.427,This is because of harboring race Anonymousity.,3,,
44,0.97,327.427,329.729,There is undermine of public trust.,3,,

62,0.97,496.562,509.542,I would like to project this as bad policy that has the city of Seattle loose control over important decisions of public safety.,7,,

182,0.97,1410.208,1430.662,About 50 years ago the land was taken from them under the threat of imminent domain which we believe was illegal and also this particular church has been helping assisting the neighborhood which is a central area for over 40 years in trying to get other people out of the gutter as myself.,42,,
183,0.97,1430.662,1458.523,"I live in one of the tiny houses and they helped that project to grow so people like myself that worked at Boeing can work at great things and then fell on hard times but they helped me in need and was able to push me back to where I am out so back into the working field and doing things because of help with organizations like them that are pushing to help the community, not just talking about it but being about it.",42,,
184,0.97,1458.523,1461.827,Thank you very much.,42,,

189,0.97,1477.742,1492.891,"I'm calling in support of the ban on SP D training with the military police forces, this is not just about Israel but any nation that violates the Geneva convention.",43,,
190,0.97,1492.891,1507.239,Last year the black lives matter movement put a spotlight on the role that police play in society and the situation in Israel a few months ago shows that these two forces I don't thing we should have them trained with each other.,43,,
191,0.97,1507.239,1519.784,And police across the country and Democratic cities brutally used tear gas and I have seen horrible things taking place in Palestine earlier this year.,43,,
192,0.97,1519.784,1530.262,I think if anyone is in opposition to this I would raise the question do you agree with the Geneva convention basic human rights war crimes and so on.,43,,
193,0.97,1530.262,1538.003,We need Democratic oversight for this whole power to hire and fire police and ability to set training policy as well.,43,,
194,0.97,1538.003,1543.975,Thank you for calling in.,44,,

201,0.97,1563.762,1574.673,I have heard it is Unfairl signaling out Israel but when you read the bill it is clear that this ban applies to any agency that is a human rights Violater.,47,,
202,0.97,1574.673,1587.385,The reason Israel is important because we know there are records of SP D training with the Israeli police and Israeli has violations of the Geneva convention.,47,,
203,0.97,1587.385,1592.19,Violating human rights is not endorsing anti-Semitism.,47,,
204,0.97,1592.19,1594.793,My partner is Jewish is in support of the bill.,47,,
205,0.97,1594.793,1610.408,If you have police in one state and used in another state when they train together why should we allow our police to train with human rights Violators.,47,,
206,0.97,1610.408,1611.376,Need full accountability to hire and fire.,47,,

434,0.97,3125.622,3138.702,On June 16th the utility presented the plan to our committee and on July 7th our committee heard from the city light review panel about why they endorse city light strategic plan.,124,,
435,0.97,3138.702,3153.35,Multi year plan for the mission of this one billion dollar city owned utility enterprise that provides affordable and environmental electricity to people in the surrounding areas.,124,,
436,0.97,3153.35,3156.019,Despite several costs pressures including the Covid pandemic.,124,,
437,0.97,3156.019,3167.931,Seattle city light has surpassed expectations in keeping the rate increases under control.,124,,
438,0.97,3167.931,3172.469,City light also succeeded in not increasing the unit utility bills.,124,,
439,0.97,3172.469,3177.674,City lights proposed rate Pike will have lower than expected rate increase in the future.,124,,
440,0.97,3177.674,3179.342,As compared to the previous strategic plan.,124,,
441,0.97,3179.342,3187.35,Net result is the six year average annual increase that will be less than 3.5%.,124,,
442,0.97,3187.35,3188.485,And so the original 4.5%.,124,,
443,0.97,3188.485,3196.66,On June 16th our committee I already said this.,124,,
444,0.97,3196.66,3198.762,So our committee endorsed this plan as recommend passage today.,124,,
445,0.97,3198.762,3199.396,Thank you.,124,,

449,0.97,3214.644,3214.878,Please.,125,,
450,0.97,3214.878,3221.117,As I have done I will vote yes on the strategic plan to reflect city lights projected costs.,126,,
451,0.97,3221.117,3230.393,However when it lists a projection of the rate increases for the next seven years it does not say who Shold pay that.,126,,
452,0.97,3230.393,3244.608,Since Tanking office including as a previous chair of the energy committee I have consistently argued that the way city lights divide up costs between big business and regular Seattle residents is very Regressive.,126,,
453,0.97,3244.608,3251.081,City lights eventually charges Seattle residents twice as much for a unit of electricity as it charges big business.,126,,
454,0.97,3251.081,3263.627,Several years ago my office proposed legislation to change that but no other Councilmember agreed.,126,,
455,0.97,3263.627,3267.097,There is a plan for low income residents.,126,,
456,0.97,3267.097,3272.068,Less than half of people in Seattle are actually on the discount program.,126,,
457,0.97,3272.068,3286.182,So I am voting yes on this city lights but will vote no on legislation to raise rates unless they are paid by big business instead of regular working class Seattleitess.,126,,
458,0.97,3286.182,3286.483,Thank you.,126,,
459,0.97,3286.483,3291.721,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,127,,

494,0.97,3396.025,3407.57,The 2021 adopted budget anticipated additional taxable bond bills for the walk and the expansion project and directed those proceeds to the same Fund.,151,,
495,0.97,3407.57,3414.811,"Now, the administration services the Department has since determined that we can sell Nontaxable bonds for the West Seattle bridge repair.",151,,
496,0.97,3414.811,3424.42,But that those bonds proceeds will need to be held in a separate Fund from the taxable bonds.,151,,
497,0.97,3424.42,3431.394,This legislation does just that.,151,,
498,0.97,3431.394,3438.368,The legislation Accordingly offers several technical corrections to the bond repair work.,151,,

613,0.97,3788.851,3799.996,The legislation represents the first time that office of housing is utilizing the acquisition authority that I sponsored via amendment to the Finance plan in 2019.,228,,
