20,0.97,109.843,121.654,"Before we begin public comment, I want to highlight the unusual process for deliberations on our last lethal weapons bill.",9,,
21,0.97,121.654,148.681,"Just want to note for folks who may be listening in or intending to use public comment today on that topic, any recommendations that the committee makes on less lethal weapons will have to be submitted to the monitor and the U.S. Department of justice and U.S. District Court before we have any full counsel actions.",9,,
22,0.97,148.681,172.405,"We have to do this because the city of Seattle and Seattle police Department are under a consent decree under the supervision of a consent decree, and we have to meet terms that are laid out in the consent decree that include the review and approval of bills related to police use of force.",9,,
23,0.97,172.405,177.844,"So under the consent decree, the monitor and DOJ must review and the court must approve any proposed changes to the use of force in the city of Seattle.",9,,
24,0.97,177.844,195.094,"So, just as a point of information, the bill that we have before us today that we have had several meetings on since this summer will not be moving to full council as is typically the process.",9,,
25,0.97,195.094,205.572,"Normally after a committee vote, Legislature will move on to full Council for the full council vote.",9,,
26,0.97,205.572,206.239,That will not happen.,9,,
27,0.97,206.239,210.21,"After this committee recommendation, then we will be submitting to legislation to the court, for review.",9,,

29,0.97,212.445,213.313,"Good morning, Councilmember Lewis.",9,,

35,0.97,246.145,260.56,"And in order to facilitate the public comment discussion, we will identify a fair amount of time for everybody to speak.",9,,
36,0.97,260.56,267.033,"We have 20 minutes on the agenda, and I want to do everything I can to allow for as many people to speak as possible.",9,,
37,0.97,267.033,270.603,"So instead of the normal two minutes of time, we will have 1.5 minutes to speak.",9,,
38,0.97,270.603,276.009,"So, a minute and a half.",9,,
39,0.97,276.009,276.709,90 seconds per Speaker.,9,,
40,0.97,276.709,283.016,"I will call on each Speaker per name, and in the order in which they registered on the Council's Website.",9,,
41,0.97,283.016,292.025,"If you have not registered to speak but would like to, you can find out before the end of the public hearing by going to the Council's Website.",9,,
42,0.97,292.025,293.493,The link is also noted on today's agenda.,9,,
43,0.97,293.493,296.496,"Once I call a Speaker's name, you'll hear a prompt.",9,,
44,0.97,296.496,303.703,"Once you have heard that prompt, you need to play press Star six to Unmute your self.",9,,
45,0.97,303.703,307.507,Please begin by stating your name and item by which you are addressing.,9,,
46,0.97,307.507,318.317,Speakers will hear a time when 10 seconds are left of their allotted time.,9,,
47,0.97,318.317,321.254,"Once the Spiegel here's the Chime, we ask that you begin to wrap up your public comment.",9,,
48,0.97,321.254,328.628,"If speakers do not hear the Chime at the end of the allotted time provided, the Speaker's microphone will be muted at the end of 10 minutes to allow us to hear the next Speaker.",9,,
49,0.97,328.628,345.478,"Once you have completed your time and given your public comment, please Disconnect your line . You can do so at the Seattle channel or listing options.",9,,
50,0.97,345.478,356.656,"In order to allow as many speakers to speak as possible, as I mentioned earlier, I've adjusted the speaking time from two minutes to 90 seconds.",9,,
51,0.97,356.656,364.197,"And now, if there are no objections, I will amend the agenda to allow some additional time for public speaking.",9,,
52,0.97,364.197,373.206,"So again, if there are no objections, I'd like to amend the agenda for 30 minutes of public comment, rather than 20 minutes.",9,,
53,0.97,373.206,382.782,"Hearing no objections, the agenda is amended to allow for 30 minute public comment.",9,,
54,0.97,382.782,387.987,"So next, I'm going to begin calling on the speakers in order to speak.",9,,
55,0.97,387.987,398.631,"We will start with Howard gale, followed by Stephen Ramos.",9,,
56,0.97,398.631,400.266,Good morning.,10,,
57,0.97,400.266,425.057,"As Seattle recently noted in relation to many months of horrifying reviews committed by Seattle police, quote, the allegations for policy violations in 5 of 22 cases, only one officer so far has been disciplined, and that was a written Reprimand.",10,,
58,0.97,425.057,436.936,"We are now well past the contractual 180 day Timeline for disciplining officers for many of the most horrifying abuses of last summer, guaranteeing that police will issue sanctions, Emboldening them to continue their abuse.",10,,
59,0.97,436.936,437.77,"Yet, here we are today.",10,,
60,0.97,437.77,452.885,"This morning, you will be discussing certain tools of police abuse, a worthy goal, but meaningless as long as police have--guns, arrests, et cetera, in a system that completely lacks accountability.",10,,
61,0.97,452.885,462.862,The community police Commission will hold a police use of force policy with no real opportunity for public input and a total complete absence of the victims of those policies.,10,,
62,0.97,462.862,477.31,"The particular irony here is that you will be discussing Aws you have no control over because of the Federal Court consent decree, while you ignore actions that is accountability you could take to bring officers to justice.",10,,
63,0.97,477.31,488.387,"Imagine engaging in this policy discussion around domestic abuse, where in the morning they discuss what methods of abuse Abusers have recourse to in a system that would refuse to uphold--to account and in the evening they have a discussion led by experts without hearing criminal reviews.",10,,
64,0.97,488.387,491.924,"Please, you must do better.",10,,
65,0.97,491.924,496.095,"The next Speaker is Stephen Ramose, followed by Kate Rubin.",11,,

68,0.97,505.004,506.005,My name is Stephen Ramos.,11,,
69,0.97,506.005,507.94,I'm calling regarding the changes being made to the chemical weapons ban.,11,,
70,0.97,507.94,519.418,"I'd like to remind the Council the use of these weapons escalated an already tense and horrifying situations, and not only injured protesters, but also those that lived in the homes nearby and sent many people who lived in Seattle into fear and chaos.",11,,
71,0.97,519.418,524.056,"Please remember the people that you are hurting, have hurt, and will be hurt by these weapons.",11,,
72,0.97,524.056,525.725,Thank you for the time today.,11,,

77,0.97,538.971,541.674,I'm a resident of district 2 and the executive director of Seattle.,13,,
78,0.97,541.674,555.788,I'm calling today to call on Seattle to uphold the ban on weapons without any crowd control.,13,,
79,0.97,555.788,557.356,I'm frustrated that this is up for discussion again.,13,,
80,0.97,557.356,564.297,Nonlethal does not mean nonviolent and I witnessed firsthand how use of these weapons escalated violence and causes physical and emotional harm to protesters.,13,,
81,0.97,564.297,571.304,"Not only is it a massive waste of resources, it will of course put black and Brown activists at further risk.",13,,
82,0.97,571.304,575.908,"Seattle holds itself as progressive, so we need to be leaders and show the rest of the country how to take care of the people.",13,,
83,0.97,575.908,576.242,Thank you.,13,,
84,0.97,576.242,576.809,"Thank you, Kate.",14,,

86,0.97,580.279,581.814,My name is Barbara Finney.,15,,
87,0.97,581.814,591.223,I'm a retired registered nurse speaking in favor of keeping the ban as it is.,15,,
88,0.97,591.223,592.625,Scientists and medical communities have recently weighed in.,15,,
89,0.97,592.625,626.492,"The chemical weapons research consortium, a group of scientists, published an open letter to American elected officials on January 19th, requesting that you leverage any and all avenues to hold current and future use of chemical weapons against civilians in calling for a complete moratorium on chemical weapons being used on humans in the U.S. on January 13th, the New England Journal of medicine published an article, injuries from less lethal weapons during the George Floyd protests in Minneapolis.",15,,
90,0.97,626.492,641.273,"It concludes, although the results represent only a single region in worldwide protests, these findings reveal that under current practices, projectiles are not appropriate for crowd control.",15,,
91,0.97,641.273,643.909,Keep your original strong legislative ban on SPD having them use these weapons against people.,15,,
92,0.97,643.909,644.577,The people you represent.,15,,
93,0.97,644.577,650.182,"Keep the ban on police, use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and other so-called crowd control weapons, black lives matter.",15,,
94,0.97,650.182,652.485,Thank you on Barbara.,16,,

97,0.97,669.668,675.474,"And C, are you with us?",16,,
98,0.97,675.474,683.716,"If you are with us, you need to hit Star six.",16,,
99,0.97,683.716,684.116,All right.,16,,
100,0.97,684.116,689.422,Let's move on to Tara Miller- Barry.,16,,
101,0.97,689.422,691.724,"If Lindsay comes back, we will try to get Lindsay in.",16,,
102,0.97,691.724,691.924,Tara?,16,,
103,0.97,691.924,695.294,Hi.,17,,

108,0.97,704.837,705.104,We can.,18,,
109,0.97,705.104,705.371,Hi.,19,,
110,0.97,705.371,706.405,"Okay, good day, city council.",19,,
111,0.97,706.405,707.106,My name is Lindsay Anderson.,19,,
112,0.97,707.106,714.046,"And I am wanting to discuss today, I came to defend the ban on the police force.",19,,
113,0.97,714.046,730.629,"I really believe that it has been very extreme, the use of the police force on our people, and these are people who are coming to make space and peaceful protests.",19,,
114,0.97,730.629,743.375,"And they have been using deadly force upon our people that are homeless, when I believe that it is the police's responsibility to be protecting and serving us.",19,,
115,0.97,743.375,749.582,"And this is not protecting and serving us by using deadly force upon people that are sleeping, like they used upon Clayton Norton.",19,,
116,0.97,749.582,760.392,A black who fell upon his ear when he was simply laying down.,19,,
117,0.97,760.392,765.865,Laying down is simply one of the most peaceful and trusting things that you can say to someone.,19,,
118,0.97,765.865,767.9,"It is saying that, police, we expect you to be protecting us.",19,,
119,0.97,767.9,771.837,"We trust you, that you are protecting us and serving us, and this is what we expect of them.",19,,
120,0.97,771.837,774.607,Thank you.,20,,
121,0.97,774.607,776.142,"Okay, thank you, Lindsay.",21,,
122,0.97,776.142,788.22,"Next, we have Tara Miller-Barry followed by Theo Buck.",21,,
123,0.97,788.22,788.521,Tara?,21,,
124,0.97,788.521,788.754,Hi.,22,,
125,0.97,788.754,795.127,My name is Tara Miller-Vary from district 1. I work at space action network and am a member of the United Methodist church in Ballard.,22,,
126,0.97,795.127,808.707,"As someone who face the nightmare of the Militarized police Department using some weapons not even allowed in war, I'm urging you to side with the thousands of protesters who continue to stand up for black and indigenous lives and hold for commitment for the ban on these so-called weapons.",22,,
127,0.97,808.707,810.109,"Thank you, council member Pedersen.",22,,
128,0.97,810.109,826.792,"The council member also you causes--military style tactics for police control, end quote.",22,,
129,0.97,826.792,832.364,"Last summer made it clear that SPD has no control over their tactics and cannot be trusted to assess the situation, use of weapons of any kind as a means of crowd control.",22,,
130,0.97,832.364,842.141,"From missing a child, to using crowd control to Terrorize a crowd nightly, as they are reviving them, these weapons can be lethal and are extremely dangerous, especially in the hands of a trigger-happy and racist organization.",22,,
131,0.97,842.141,852.418,This comes in stark contrast to the very light to know police force used in the January coup attempt in D.C. and Capitols around the nation including Olympia.,22,,
132,0.97,852.418,860.226,"Spd argued that without these weapons, police will be forced to use more brutal weapons such as Batons and bullets.",22,,
133,0.97,860.226,863.128,I urge you to stand against this Rhtoric and imagine a world without police violence altogether.,22,,
134,0.97,863.128,865.397,Please continue to uphold the ban and do not water it down.,22,,
135,0.97,865.397,866.065,Thanks.,22,,
136,0.97,866.065,867.466,Thank you very much.,23,,
137,0.97,867.466,882.281,"Next, we have Leah buck, followed by Claire Forney.",23,,
138,0.97,885.551,886.051,"Good morning, council.",24,,
139,0.97,886.051,890.356,My name is Julia Buck in district 6. I'm going to express my concern that the Council is considering weakening the crowd control weapons ban.,24,,
140,0.97,890.356,900.933,I only ask the Council to insert police the Federal court to remove the state order on the weapons ban placed at the request of the Mayor's office and former chief best.,24,,
141,0.97,900.933,915.08,Is seems very Counterintuitive that taking weapons out of SPD's arsenal would be a violation of the consent decree that was put in place because SPD cannot be trusted with its deployment of force.,24,,
142,0.97,915.08,920.286,I would also like to ask the Council to hold SPD accountable for their $5 million in excess spending in 2020 by removing that same amount for 2021's SPD budget.,24,,
143,0.97,920.286,924.256,I believe it sets a very dangerous precedent for city departments not to be required to adhere to budget allocations.,24,,
144,0.97,924.256,932.231,Particularly a Militarized force when that amount is set by our elected officials.,24,,
145,0.97,932.231,934.033,We have civilian control of the military for this reason.,24,,
146,0.97,934.033,938.771,Thank you very much for your consideration.,24,,
147,0.97,938.771,939.338,"Thank you, Julia.",25,,
148,0.97,939.338,947.179,"Next, we have Carol Forney, followed by Anna Pei.",25,,
149,0.97,947.179,953.452,"Carol, are you with us?",25,,
150,0.97,953.452,961.794,Carol Forney?,25,,
151,0.97,961.794,962.861,I'm not seeing you logged in.,25,,
152,0.97,962.861,966.298,"So, let's move down to Anna Pei.",25,,
153,0.97,966.298,975.207,"Anna Pei, are you with us?",25,,
154,0.97,975.207,976.175,All right.,25,,
155,0.97,976.175,979.712,Next Speaker is mark Taylor.,25,,

161,0.97,998.597,1000.499,We will work people back in if people come back on.,25,,
162,0.97,1000.499,1014.913,"The next person I have listed present is Anitra Freeman, followed by Haerkat Seit.",25,,
163,0.97,1017.549,1019.251,Anitra is not on the line.,26,,
164,0.97,1019.251,1019.551,Hello?,27,,
165,0.97,1019.551,1022.321,Hello?,27,,

167,0.97,1022.554,1022.855,"Hi, Anitra.",28,,
168,0.97,1022.855,1024.123,"Okay, yes.",29,,
169,0.97,1024.123,1025.224,Good morning.,29,,
170,0.97,1025.224,1035.034,"I'm speaking to you this morning from the women's shelter, which is up by eight and Cherry.",29,,
171,0.97,1035.034,1044.276,"I was just told this morning that back in June, they had Teargas pouring in through the windows here.",29,,
172,0.97,1044.276,1062.694,And that's just one of the incidents where the police use of crowd control is more of a threat to the public than what they are supposedly protecting us against.,29,,
173,0.97,1062.694,1072.171,Clayton your 10 was a homeless man who was asleep in Cal Anderson park on June 1ST.,29,,
174,0.97,1072.171,1075.908,He was hit in the head and the chest by blast Bolds.,29,,

358,0.97,2242.273,2250.014,"I was supportive of the resolution last summer stating that the Council would no longer be Backfilling SPD's overtime spending, much of which last summer was used to engage in responding to protesters violently.",64,,
359,0.97,2250.014,2262.56,"Council ended up Backfilling SPD's black all by $5.4 million, but also introduced legislation to cut the same amount from this year's budget.",64,,
360,0.97,2262.56,2266.33,"Bypassing that legislation, you ill be continuing t your word to hold the line against mayors and SPD unaccountable spending.",64,,
361,0.97,2266.33,2275.406,"By putting this money toward Participatory budgeting, we could use funding projects that actually promote true public safety.",64,,

369,0.97,2293.157,2300.064,The staff has been banned internationally during war.,66,,
370,0.97,2300.064,2310.207,"I'm not the only one but I will speak for myself here, I was Teargas during a protest for peacefully protesting and I had my period for three weeks afterwards which is not normal at all.",66,,
371,0.97,2310.207,2325.456,Planned Parenthood is currently doing reproductive health studies on the effects of gas because we don't even know all of the effects.,66,,
372,0.97,2325.456,2328.225,What if folks who have a Uterus cannot have children because they were gassed by SPD?,66,,
373,0.97,2328.225,2329.56,"Are you okay with that, because I'm not.",66,,
374,0.97,2329.56,2333.764,Police were capable of using discretion and capable of deciding when is violent and nonviolent in order to justify the use of these weapons.,66,,
375,0.97,2333.764,2339.036,They simply cannot be justified at all.,66,,
376,0.97,2339.036,2341.405,"And if they are used improperly, there is no accountability and consequences.",66,,
377,0.97,2341.405,2342.273,The gas itself cannot be contained.,66,,
378,0.97,2342.273,2346.977,Countless protesters have been harmed physically and emotionally . do your jobs and ban these tools of oppression and violence.,66,,
379,0.97,2346.977,2351.749,Defund and abolish police.,66,,

389,0.97,2383.714,2388.018,I'm calling in defense of upholding the ban on crowd control and chemical weapons as it is.,70,,
390,0.97,2388.018,2400.231,And I don't believe it is responsible and appropriate to be using these heavily Militaristic weapons in the city and on cities of Nonresidents.,70,,
391,0.97,2400.231,2421.552,"I really appreciate everybody going out with the full black lives matter movement, and bringing forward these positions and participating democratically in the way the current system allows them to, and in the way they need to do it to get their voices heard.",70,,
392,0.97,2421.552,2449.914,"And, I don't think the police should be using violent tactics on largely peaceful protesters and if we want to address crime, which isn't what these protests are in the first place, they need to be investing more in the community and in things that will actually help reduce crime instead of more heavily arming and things that are more violent.",70,,
393,0.97,2449.914,2467.264,"I think tools like Teargas and the bullets and--sorry, the glass balls that keep escalating the situation, making things --",70,,
394,0.97,2467.264,2467.898,"Thank you, Eric.",71,,
395,0.97,2467.898,2472.403,We've got four more people signed up for public comment.,71,,

411,0.97,2555.586,2562.092,"The thing about that is, during the event set the nation's Capitol on January 6th, we had Capitol police taking Selfies with the Insurrectionist.",76,,
412,0.97,2562.092,2568.999,The idea that the cops are going to use Teargas to protect you from a real threat is frankly just not based in reality.,76,,
413,0.97,2568.999,2581.512,"Secondly, and I think more importantly, you need to base your policies in and around the results that we have been seeing.",76,,
414,0.97,2581.512,2582.579,A 7-Year-Old kid got Maced.,76,,
415,0.97,2582.579,2583.647,We Teargas a residential neighborhood repeatedly.,76,,
416,0.97,2583.647,2587.418,"If you rollback the ban, that's just going to keep happening, so there needs to be a mechanism in place.",76,,
417,0.97,2587.418,2591.188,There is no accountability for anyone.,76,,
418,0.97,2591.188,2591.689,Thank you.,77,,

I want to echo many of the excellent comments, especially with the experienced coalition, and I want to thank Council member Sawant for her work on this and Council member Herbold on the misdemeanor reform proposal, although the media, ""the Seattle times,"" has done their best to extort that.",78,,
424,0.97,2634.465,2648.278,"In this case, the most important thing used to be that the consent decree ought to be a full--not a ceiling for what the city council can impose in police accountability.",78,,
425,0.97,2648.278,2656.153,We have a new Attorney General and justice Department turnover Perhaps you are more interested in police reform than the Trump administration.,78,,

439,0.97,2723.52,2739.336,"I think I have heard a lot of folks talk about insurrection at the Capitol being used, and I really want to inform Democrats to not be using this as an excuse to increase surveillance and increase policing, and Demilitarized violent police that has been committed from SPD.",82,,
440,0.97,2739.336,2741.071,That has gone ultimately unchecked.,82,,
441,0.97,2741.071,2753.984,"And, using the threat to increase enforcement against peaceful and or otherwise protests is not what I --",82,,
442,0.97,2753.984,2756.186,Thank you.,83,,

458,0.97,2820.651,2824.121,Too often we've seen weapons used in an attempt to stop legitimate protests by people practicing peaceful civil disobedience.,86,,
459,0.97,2824.121,2828.025,These weapons are potentially lethal.,86,,
460,0.97,2828.025,2831.195,They have been used at times to stifle political dissent and they have harmed residents of the neighborhoods.,86,,
461,0.97,2831.195,2836.767,And bystanders who have nothing to do with protests.,86,,

463,0.97,2837.868,2839.903,Is this a real move to ban these weapons?,86,,
464,0.97,2839.903,2842.673,Or only a halfhearted political gesture?,86,,

486,0.97,2937.467,2963.293,And I think maybe what I like to do first is open up the floor to my colleagues on the Council to see whether or not they have any particular follow-ups to the questions and answers that were submitted last week.,93,,
487,0.97,2963.293,2964.494,This is Council member Lewis.,94,,

493,0.97,2995.659,3027.557,"I was jumping to the meat of the questions, because we did have the candidate in committee two weeks ago, where we heard about her experience, and we heard from deputy Mayor about why they feel that she is the best candidate, and we also heard not just from the nominee about her experience, but why it is that she is interested in serving in this role at this very challenging time.",97,,
494,0.97,3027.557,3048.678,But absolutely happy to open it up to any additional thoughts that the nominee has about this new role that she is about to embark in.,97,,

500,0.97,3071.568,3101.631,"I am very much committed to using the lessons we have learned in Covid about continuing to reach Underserved populations, both in the community, and also for people with access and functional needs, and the Covid pandemic has emphasized that that is still an issue for us in all of the work that we do for preparedness, mitigation, and of course in response.",98,,
501,0.97,3101.631,3103.099,And as the city moves into recovery.,98,,
502,0.97,3103.099,3108.905,So the office of emergency management is very much involved in the Covid response and the vaccine deployment.,98,,
503,0.97,3108.905,3111.041,But we also have a number of other hazards that face Seattle.,98,,
504,0.97,3111.041,3119.015,"So our focus this year will also be on those more traditional, if you will, kinds of emergencies, hazards, and Vulnerabilities.",98,,
505,0.97,3119.015,3132.929,"So, earthquake preparedness, the Nisqually earthquake anniversary is coming up.",98,,
506,0.97,3132.929,3142.172,Earthquake preparedness will be our topic in a lot of different Venues as we continue to work with the community to help them understand how they best prepare for that.,98,,
507,0.97,3142.172,3150.447,"We are also looking at, or are also super excited that we are going to be an independent organization.",98,,
508,0.97,3150.447,3158.688,"So our own Department with the ability to work directly within the Mayor's office, making decisions, but also working with all departments.",98,,
509,0.97,3158.688,3172.636,"Emergency management is really a team sport and is connected to everything, so it requires all of the departments and agencies to continue to come together the way that they did in Covid to make sure that we serve everybody in Seattle.",98,,
510,0.97,3172.636,3174.304,"All of the neighborhoods, regardless of how we do that.",98,,
511,0.97,3174.304,3180.777,"And so, I'm excited to lead that team in coordination and collaboration to best serve Seattle residents.",98,,
512,0.97,3180.777,3187.184,And thank you again for this amazing opportunity.,98,,
513,0.97,3187.184,3188.118,I'm really honored to be here.,98,,
514,0.97,3188.118,3188.618,Thank you.,99,,
515,0.97,3188.618,3209.039,"And just because I think it is useful for the viewing public to have the benefit of some of the questions that the Council asked in your thorough and helpful answers, I wanted to sum up some of what those questions asked and give you an opportunity to share your answers with the viewing public.",99,,
516,0.97,3209.039,3222.953,"One of the questions we asked is, what do you see is among the most effective pools to address racial equity in the field of emergency management?",99,,
517,0.97,3222.953,3235.865,"And, another was, how specifically would you work to recruit mentor and train communities to enter the field of emergency management?",99,,
518,0.97,3235.865,3236.766,"Sorry, I'm Unmute again.",100,,
519,0.97,3236.766,3237.267,So yes.,100,,
520,0.97,3237.267,3240.203,I'm happy to talk about that.,100,,
521,0.97,3240.203,3266.463,"So, in addressing racial equity in preparing for responding to a recovery from a disaster, it is really--starts with understanding how systemic racism has adversely impacted communities and other vulnerable populations . So those with access and functional needs as well.",100,,
522,0.97,3266.463,3285.548,"Because everything that impacts people's daily lives and things that make it hard for them to get services or do the things that they need to do, whether it's access to education or transportation or health, all of those things that impact your life also impact your ability to be resilient which is really what emergency management is about.",100,,
523,0.97,3285.548,3295.458,"So if we are not addressing those things, then it would be impossible to help people be prepared.",100,,
524,0.97,3295.458,3307.037,"So it means that we learn and understand what a community needs and believes is important, and then work with them to help them understand what are the Vulnerabilities and hazards that they face.",100,,
525,0.97,3307.037,3316.479,"And then we can talk about what it means to build community resilience which will make people more prepared, just by virtue as a fact of that community, that community resilience building.",100,,
526,0.97,3316.479,3335.799,"So, Oems partnership with other departments to address these daily life issues allows us to be more successful at focusing on preparedness issues that will make sense toward go a community or a neighborhood.",100,,
527,0.97,3335.799,3337.067,And all of their needs are different.,100,,
528,0.97,3337.067,3353.083,"So, when we first addressed those things that a community struggles with every day, then we can look at, how do we help them be more prepared?",100,,
529,0.97,3353.083,3355.719,"So, one of the things that you can do is, first, a community needs assessment.",100,,
530,0.97,3355.719,3369.766,Sometimes we do that with a survey.,100,,
531,0.97,3369.766,3378.875,"The survey would not just be done through technology, but we use community safety ambassadors who are partners and people who are trained to do preparedness and work with us and teaching skills, but they also are connected to a community, they speak that community's language.",100,,
532,0.97,3378.875,3384.114,"So, that a survey of what's important to you and what you know about the hazards you face would be the first thing that you would do.",100,,
533,0.97,3384.114,3411.307,"The second thing that is to make relationships with community leaders, so people that already have a relationship in those different areas, be it a neighborhood, a particular community, community organizations, Nonprofits, the private sector, all of those community leaders are important, not only Messengers, but sort of what we call culture brokers.",100,,
534,0.97,3411.307,3414.244,There's a lot of folks who still don't trust the government.,100,,
535,0.97,3414.244,3425.488,"They may have had a bad experience, or it may just be that that is not something that is part of their cultural understanding.",100,,
536,0.97,3425.488,3437.467,"So when you make those relationships with people that have relationships already in the community, then we are able to work with them in understanding what a community needs, but also helping us provide Messaging.",100,,
537,0.97,3437.467,3446.776,"And very much focused for everyone, not just by black communities, but on how we get our Messaging out and how we work with people not just using technology.",100,,
538,0.97,3446.776,3454.184,"There is still a large portion of the population everywhere, not just in Seattle, that that is not an option.",100,,
539,0.97,3454.184,3462.926,Some of the other things that I've used that are successful are working with the schools.,100,,
540,0.97,3462.926,3463.893,"So, children are great teachers.",100,,
541,0.97,3463.893,3479.108,"They are also adamant about when they learn something new, they go back and work with their families and stay on that message for a long period of time.",100,,
542,0.97,3479.108,3487.817,"So, two of the really Well- known campaigns that children actually had a big part in were the Non-smoking campaign that now seems like that was a long time ago, right?",100,,
543,0.97,3487.817,3488.384,And also recycling.,100,,
544,0.97,3488.384,3489.519,Those are things that children championed.,100,,
545,0.97,3489.519,3493.69,"So, working with children and talking to them about, what are the hazards we face?",100,,
546,0.97,3493.69,3495.425,What is the community resilience they need?,100,,
547,0.97,3495.425,3504.2,Also then targeting specific populations in the schools.,100,,
548,0.97,3504.2,3512.942,"In Bellevue, we worked with a special Ed teacher and some special education students and first responders.",100,,
549,0.97,3512.942,3513.643,We developed a script.,100,,
550,0.97,3513.643,3516.746,We were going to put together these mini videos on what it means when there is a disaster.,100,,
551,0.97,3516.746,3517.547,Who is going to come?,100,,
552,0.97,3517.547,3520.316,How do you know it is safe?,100,,
553,0.97,3520.316,3521.851,What does a place of refuge look like?,100,,
554,0.97,3521.851,3523.052,What does it mean to do sheltering?,100,,
555,0.97,3523.052,3532.662,"Starting with really brief, short, targeted messages through children is often super successful and something that I have used in the past.",100,,
556,0.97,3532.662,3542.171,"Also, the community emergency response team training that you have heard about that Grown-Ups use, teenagers are often also very successful in that program and then they carry the message forward.",100,,
557,0.97,3542.171,3549.579,"So, those are just a few of the messages that I've used for reaching vulnerable populations of all kinds.",100,,
558,0.97,3549.579,3552.982,Thank you so much.,100,,
559,0.97,3552.982,3566.095,"And, not seeing anybody come off of me at--Oh, council member Mireles?",101,,
560,0.97,3566.963,3567.397,Sorry.,102,,
561,0.97,3567.397,3569.599,I thought we were supposed to be using the raise the hand feature.,102,,
562,0.97,3569.599,3569.999,"So, please.",102,,
563,0.97,3569.999,3571.501,"If somebody else had their hand raised first, go ahead.",102,,
564,0.97,3571.501,3571.935,Absolutely.,103,,
565,0.97,3571.935,3573.102,"So, thank you.",104,,
566,0.97,3573.102,3584.581,"Just really quickly, I reviewed some of the materials in terms of the response is that interim director Mayer provided to the committee.",104,,
567,0.97,3584.581,3592.689,Thank you so much for that detailed response.,104,,
568,0.97,3592.689,3601.798,I like to get a little bit more of an understanding of how you are going to approach language competency within the office of emergency management.,104,,
569,0.97,3601.798,3624.954,I saw that you Referenced it essentially once in the context of preparedness and getting emergency information out to Non-English-Speaking populations or limited English speaking populations.,104,,
570,0.97,3624.954,3651.08,"But, it has long been a concern of mind that particularly in the office of emergency management, we don't seem to have a strong strategy and work plan to ensure that all components, all business lines of work that is being done by the office of emergency management has a language and cultural competency perspective.",104,,
571,0.97,3651.08,3679.809,"But, I really want to focus on that language component and, you know, I continue to be concerned that our focus around integrating language competency at OEM seems to be limited to the preparedness aspect as opposed to throughout every aspect of the office of emergency management.",104,,
572,0.97,3679.809,3680.076,Okay.,105,,
573,0.97,3680.076,3699.629,"So, if I'm understanding your question, it's about how to integrate reaching limited English proficient Messaging, or, I'm not sure I totally understand your question.",105,,
574,0.97,3699.629,3708.838,We live in a city in which many languages are spoken in our public school system.,106,,
575,0.97,3708.838,3715.978,I personally come from a family where my parents grew up not speaking English.,106,,
576,0.97,3715.978,3717.313,"I was there translator, I was there interpreter.",106,,
577,0.97,3717.313,3722.118,There are many families in Seattle whom I think are living in that same existence.,106,,
578,0.97,3722.118,3725.955,"But the office of emergency management, you know, does a lot of resiliency work.",106,,
579,0.97,3725.955,3730.693,They do a lot of preparedness work.,106,,
580,0.97,3730.693,3731.227,They do alert work.,106,,
581,0.97,3731.227,3737.366,"In other words, there is an emergency happening right now.",106,,
582,0.97,3737.366,3738.634,This is what you need to know.,106,,
583,0.97,3738.634,3764.393,"You know, as a clear example, when the ride the ducks massive fatal crash happened on the bridge, the University of Washington bridge, those were mostly foreign students whose family members and many of them did not speak any English, and we had a Heck of a time scrambling to try to figure out who was going to translate and interpret and we were doing that in real time.",106,,
584,0.97,3764.393,3770.199,"Now, I think we have learned some lessons from that.",106,,
585,0.97,3770.199,3781.911,But I still feel like that is sort of the component around language access and understanding that people in the city of Seattle receive and process information in a language other than English.,106,,
586,0.97,3781.911,3790.186,"That culture, I feel like, it's still not getting baked into the office of emergency management.",106,,
587,0.97,3790.186,3808.738,"And when it is being talked about in terms of the work that the office of emergency management does, it is, in my experience, very limited to Notifications or to, you know, the preparedness bucket only in terms of language access.",106,,
588,0.97,3808.738,3822.151,"I like to get a better understanding of what your strategies are going to be or whether you are going to Prioritize, ensuring that there is language access in other aspects of the work that the office of emergency management does.",106,,
589,0.97,3822.151,3823.152,"Okay, Okay, thank you.",107,,
590,0.97,3823.152,3851.013,"So, one of the programs that we use currently that can be expanded beyond preparedness is the use of community safety ambassadors who are community members who speak other languages and are connected to different parts of the community, who can translate not only ahead of time, but also in real time with different communities.",107,,
591,0.97,3851.013,3856.886,"So, we have focused mostly on using them in preparedness and in Messaging, as you described.",107,,
592,0.97,3856.886,3886.082,"But we also, all of our plans around, what are we going to do post emergency or also with our mitigation plans, are things that we can use those translation services, not only the community service ambassadors, but the contract that we have for translation can also be used when we asked for public comment on those really important plans.",107,,
593,0.97,3886.082,3896.859,"So, the hazard mitigation plan is about--which is on the Website right now, here are the things that we are vulnerable to, and here is how we want public comment on the actions that we are taking around mitigation.",107,,
594,0.97,3896.859,3902.898,All of the rest of our plans are also posted for public comment.,107,,
595,0.97,3902.898,3913.042,"So, we can use those--I'm sorry.",107,,
596,0.97,3913.042,3928.524,"I lost my--we can use those community service ambassadors and also our translation services to translate those plans so that we have that access to translate it for those other pieces of emergency management, not just preparedness.",107,,
597,0.97,3928.524,3939.168,"So the mitigation, response plans, and how we do emergency management in general.",107,,
598,0.97,3939.168,3941.07,We ask for public comment on everything that we do.,107,,
599,0.97,3941.07,3941.504,"So, you're right.",107,,
600,0.97,3941.504,3945.641,Making sure that people who speak languages other than English also have access and know about those plans is really important.,107,,
601,0.97,3945.641,3951.881,It also then would require us to take those plans to people and not just post them.,107,,
602,0.97,3951.881,3960.856,"So they are not just on the Website, but we are actually meeting with community groups and saying, Hey, you may not be aware of this.",107,,
603,0.97,3960.856,3965.161,There is a hazard mitigation plan.,107,,
604,0.97,3965.161,3966.495,"First of all, what is hazard mitigation?",107,,
605,0.97,3966.495,3981.177,"And with experiences that they understand, and then asking them, this is how that might affect you, and, how would you engage with us, or what are the things that you would change?",107,,
606,0.97,3981.177,3982.478,What makes sense to you?,107,,
607,0.97,3982.478,3986.115,"What is, like, that isn't going to work at all?",107,,
608,0.97,3986.115,3988.684,I see that as probably the most effective way to do that language translation.,107,,
609,0.97,3988.684,3989.919,In those other areas as you mentioned.,107,,
610,0.97,3989.919,4005.701,"And you are probably aware that there is also--there was a bill about two years ago now that required that all of what we do in emergency management, including Messaging, needs to be translated into the top language.",107,,
611,0.97,4005.701,4025.654,"So, the either 1% of the population, or 1000 people, whichever is smaller, are the languages that you have to translate what you do in an emergency management for those communities to engage.",107,,
612,0.97,4025.654,4029.425,"So, it is definitely a challenge, but not something that we can't do or something that we are not striving to do.",107,,
613,0.97,4029.425,4030.726,"So, thank you for that question.",107,,
614,0.97,4030.726,4040.77,And let me know if you need more detail.,107,,
615,0.97,4040.77,4041.27,Thank you.,108,,
616,0.97,4041.27,4045.174,"I know that is something that Council member Gonzalez might have an additional follow-up on, so I appreciate that.",108,,
617,0.97,4045.174,4052.081,Council member Morales?,108,,
618,0.97,4052.081,4052.982,"Thank you, good morning.",109,,
619,0.97,4052.982,4090.92,"I am interested in a different preparedness question, particularly around the reinforced masonry issue that I'm sure you know we have had many studies done here in Seattle, and as somebody who represents the financial district, where we have at least 100 buildings on the list of problematic structures, I'm really interested if you have thoughts on this question of what steps the city can take, both immediately, and in the long term.",109,,
620,0.97,4090.92,4099.895,"You know, when we are talking about the cost of doing Retrofits in some of these buildings, they can--it is substantial.",109,,
621,0.97,4099.895,4118.447,"And given that so many of the residents of these buildings are low income, raising the rent to cover the cost of the loan to make these sorts of repairs is really not an option.",109,,
622,0.97,4118.447,4122.885,"So, I'd be curious to hear your thoughts again and just give you an opportunity to share that in this form as well.",109,,
623,0.97,4122.885,4128.757,"Sure, absolutely.",110,,
624,0.97,4128.757,4130.926,"So, there are a lot of reinforced masonry buildings in San Francisco.",110,,
625,0.97,4130.926,4135.464,"I'm from California, so I'm very familiar with the efforts that happened in California.",110,,
626,0.97,4135.464,4145.474,"And here in Seattle, we have been studied and we have been attempting to deal with the issue of how we remedy that danger for about 50 years.",110,,
627,0.97,4145.474,4159.121,"So, way longer than any of us have been around, and there really is, as you had mentioned, a very high cost for retrofitting these buildings.",110,,
628,0.97,4159.121,4166.262,"So, we have never really identified a solution that would effectively Incentivize private building owners to Seismically retrofit their buildings voluntarily.",110,,
629,0.97,4166.262,4174.436,And an attempt to implement voluntary retrofitting of au Rm in California proved to be really unsuccessful.,110,,
630,0.97,4174.436,4188.918,"So most likely, a mandatory retrofit ordinance is going to be the path to making sure that, you know, there is more than 1,100 you are and buildings in the city of Seattle.",110,,
631,0.97,4188.918,4198.527,"And, some of their we look since is in this mandatory ordinance, exactly what you stated.",110,,
632,0.97,4198.527,4213.509,"And, it is expensive, and the worry is always that the building owner will then pass that expense onto the community and raising rents, and that's not a good solution either.",110,,
633,0.97,4213.509,4222.051,There is also over 2000 affordable housing units with Urm buildings here in the city of Seattle.,110,,
634,0.97,4222.051,4236.432,"So I think that one of the things that we could begin to do is to stop looking at seismic safety by it self, that it's really tied to a number of other initiatives that I think we all agree are important.",110,,
635,0.97,4236.432,4249.645,"So, affordable housing, historic preservation and clean energy are all kind of wrapped up in this ring that we talk about with seismic, safety, and the issue of Unreinforced masonry buildings.",110,,
636,0.97,4249.645,4275.504,"So, a successful mandatory retrofit ordinance will require some financing mechanism, some creative financing mechanisms that will help absorb some of that burden so that building owners don't feel like, you know, it's only on them, and they are going to pass it on to their residents or the people that are renting from them.",110,,
637,0.97,4275.504,4292.721,"And there has been some significant work done in identifying what the funding mechanisms might be, working with the private sector, and the national development Council has done some work around this, and they shared a report with the city, and we can certainly share that with you if you are interested.",110,,
638,0.97,4292.721,4309.405,"There is also an Alliance for safety, Affordability, and preservation, where building owners can get certain credits for other kinds of work that they do, if they do the Urm work, so that there is kind of a Trade-Off to that.",110,,
639,0.97,4309.405,4332.761,"So in the short term, where also OEM is looking at some funding opportunities through the Federal Government that could help with that, some mitigation grants that might be helpful, and then more long- term, looking at these other ways that we can offer creative financing and working with the private sector I think is going to be the thing that is going to get us the most Traction in this area.",110,,
640,0.97,4332.761,4357.252,"There is also--there was an example most recently with the Federal Government, they provided us a $5 million grant that we were able to provide to an owner of the Brehmer apartments, which is a 48, 49 unit affordable housing.",110,,
641,0.97,4357.252,4365.828,And so they were able to get some money for that and that held tremendously.,110,,
642,0.97,4365.828,4387.082,"But really, the solve, I think if you will, and the path to that is the partnerships that we have with private sector and other community organizations to look at how we do this and that the financial burden is not just on one sector or one portion of the financial community.",110,,
643,0.97,4387.082,4388.217,"Thank you, council member Morales.",111,,
644,0.97,4388.217,4395.824,Just a follow-up on that question.,111,,
645,0.97,4395.824,4397.76,I also added Urm on my list of things to talk about.,111,,

650,0.97,4478.44,4521.149,"Secondly, I have been working with the Alliance for safety, Portability and preservation to develop a resolution that would outline the steps that the city needs to take in order to create a mandatory Urm program, and the resolution includes a specific Timeline for Deliverables that are part of the development of such a program, and implementing the financing as mentioned before, to identifying the priority actions for buildings that are identified as buildings most vulnerable that we want to make sure that we are addressing first.",111,,
651,0.97,4521.149,4548.677,"I just want to find out, in addition to whether or not you are supportive of the retrofit credit program, whether or not you are supportive of working with me on this resolution in the next few months so that--I'm very flexible on what a desirable Timeline is of the development of this program, given the fact that we are dealing with a lot of simultaneous crises in the city.",111,,

657,0.97,4596.825,4615.644,"So, vulnerable populations, emergency managers, all of those things we want to do with mitigation in helping people understand what their Vulnerabilities are and all of that include the continued use of Urm buildings for housing.",112,,
658,0.97,4615.644,4628.824,"So, all of the people that are in those structures now, if the earthquake were to happen today or tomorrow, are going to require, they are going to be on house, they are going to have electricity, they are going to have injuries.",112,,
659,0.97,4628.824,4647.209,"All of those dangerous things that happen to somebody after a disaster, whether it be an earthquake or something smaller than that will be in serious trouble if they are in a Urm building.",112,,

946,0.97,6412.038,6413.473,This approach is looking at our community hubs.,204,,
947,0.97,6413.473,6421.748,We already informally have these hubs within our neighborhoods.,204,,

955,0.97,6453.98,6464.991,"Part of what happened before in terms of us operating individually is, we did not have the resources to provide critical incident response and Wraparound services, follow-up, outreach and recruitment.",204,,

964,0.97,6518.511,6523.35,"And so, another piece of this is our safety team which is safe passage which has been operating for the last five years.",204,,
965,0.97,6523.35,6543.603,"We have been able to see the results within the Rainier Beach neighborhood in particular, but looking to Replicate this in other neighborhoods, I'm sure some of you have already heard and heard the results of what has happened with safe passage and through some of the other efforts that are happening through the Rainier Beach neighborhood.",204,,
966,0.97,6543.603,6551.344,"Crime has been down 40% that first year we were operating, and since then, 30%.",204,,
967,0.97,6551.344,6553.78,And a lot of the data around this was reported by law enforcement.,204,,
968,0.97,6553.78,6565.325,What I think is unique is to attribute that to the community.,204,,
969,0.97,6570.463,6576.503,"What we are doing is we are taking that and really moving that and replicating everything, all that we have been doing that has been working in our own neighborhoods, and then sharing these resources.",204,,
970,0.97,6576.503,6581.641,And aligning our efforts in a way so that we can be able to address all of the things that are happening within our neighborhood and better serve our community.,204,,
971,0.97,6581.641,6583.109,I'm going to hand it over to Marvin.,204,,
972,0.97,6583.109,6583.81,Thank you.,204,,
973,0.97,6583.81,6592.285,Thank you.,205,,
974,0.97,6592.285,6596.723,"And just to add to that briefly, we will all be bringing the services that we have been doing in the community for a long time.",205,,
975,0.97,6596.723,6604.764,"And with the YMCA being part of that bitter umbrella, but then being more specifically, programming with alive and free, being Community-Based.",205,,
976,0.97,6604.764,6610.136,And almost like being a grassroots within that larger umbrella.,205,,
977,0.97,6610.136,6622.983,"You know, bringing that lens up alive and free to that work and looking at the resources, the abundance of resources, and then also identifying culturally relevant resources within each Communiy.",205,,
978,0.97,6622.983,6630.724,"Because you can make a million referrals, but if they are not applicable to your young people, they are not going to be effective.",205,,
979,0.97,6630.724,6634.027,"So looking at the balancing of which resources to apply and where to apply them to is very, very big.",205,,
980,0.97,6634.027,6636.329,"With that being said, I will pass it over to Martin.",205,,
981,0.97,6636.329,6661.921,"I think another thing, Martin, Martin, and Marti have already talked about the structure, although Marti is in the South end, and Marvin is in West Seattle will be collaborating, we'll be taught about the players who participate.",206,,
982,0.97,6661.921,6663.189,Because we are all connected directly and indirectly.,206,,
983,0.97,6663.189,6670.964,So if I have a relationship with someone who participated and I can follow up with Marti and her team and we can work together to De-Escalate from all sides.,206,,
984,0.97,6670.964,6674.401,So we are creating a net to create these issues.,206,,
985,0.97,6674.401,6680.073,I will pass it on.,206,,
986,0.97,6680.073,6681.708,It is back to me.,207,,
987,0.97,6681.708,6682.175,"Thank you, Lawson.",207,,
988,0.97,6682.175,6705.899,"So, the last piece in terms of the model, and we will give you kind of a visual as well as you can see on the screen is the training, technical assistance, and consulting, particularly around critical incident response.",207,,
989,0.97,6705.899,6712.539,I think it is important to realize that this is not a replacement for law enforcement.,207,,
990,0.97,6712.539,6713.973,That is extremely important.,207,,
991,0.97,6713.973,6722.482,"This is a safety support that can interface with both, you know, our local law enforcement, as well as our community residents.",207,,
992,0.97,6722.482,6725.318,"And I think that's what the unique feature is, of this initiative.",207,,
993,0.97,6725.318,6732.659,"The other thing I wanted to say is that you know, the foundation has been laid.",207,,
994,0.97,6732.659,6747.807,The foundation has been laid from initiatives like Seattle you violence prevention initiative and many millions of dollars in investment in city of Seattle's history.,207,,
995,0.97,6747.807,6767.927,"One of the things I think is extremely important for our respective Council members is to figure out how we can stop clearing the deck every time there is someone new in office, and to build on the foundation of the former Council member or Mayor that may have contributed.",207,,
996,0.97,6767.927,6778.271,"One of the issues that happens over and over again is, this initiative is, really, because we stayed in the work, we just simply stayed in the work, and the city has made investments.",207,,
997,0.97,6778.271,6788.648,"Úi know critical incident response, because the last initiative provided training for critical incident and response.",207,,
998,0.97,6788.648,6794.754,This is an investment in our ally that is now coming back to last the city because the city made that investment.,207,,
999,0.97,6794.754,6820.513,"But if it does not get captured in the cities, particularly our lawmakers and Council members, if they lose organizational memory, then we have to make that investment all over again and start off with a new project and call it something different during your term.",207,,
1000,0.97,6820.513,6824.918,"There has to be a better way and a smarter way for us to build on our investments, and you guys are interested officials.",207,,
1001,0.97,6824.918,6834.46,"We voted you into office and we are praying that he would give ear to some of the wisdom of the things happening, respectively.",207,,
1002,0.97,6834.46,6849.042,"So, basically in short, the four key components of the safety initiative is out community safety hubs.",207,,
1003,0.97,6849.042,6856.649,"Our community safety hubs are literally a Hub of resource, of life, of care and support that sit in the middle of those respective communities, right?",207,,
1004,0.97,6856.649,6863.122,Everything Emanates from these safety hubs.,207,,
1005,0.97,6863.122,6864.257,This is where community partners connect.,207,,
1006,0.97,6864.257,6873.8,This is where everything is invited to the table.,207,,
1007,0.97,6873.8,6875.468,The second piece is our neighborhood crisis safety teams.,207,,
1008,0.97,6875.468,6892.452,"One of the features of this point from safe passage is that they will have regular safety patrols of black and Brown safety teams, making their routine patrols through the neighborhood, you know, particularly in hot spots, right?",207,,
1009,0.97,6892.452,6907.8,"There has been a lot of research done by, I want to say, George Fox University, that basically has a whole set of data and research on hot spots and monitoring hot spots.",207,,
1010,0.97,6907.8,6917.644,"And so, our safety teams will be deployed to do patrols.",207,,
1011,0.97,6917.644,6918.912,The other aspect is critical incident response.,207,,
1012,0.97,6918.912,6932.959,"Critical incident response is literally responding to shots fired, to violent in the community, highly trained safety team members that are trained to respond to violence in the neighborhood.",207,,
1013,0.97,6932.959,6936.162,And the philosophy there is really kind of 48 hours.,207,,
1014,0.97,6936.162,6955.948,"48 hour Statistics research bears that if you can get closer to the incidents within the 48 hour period, the likelihood of you resolving and bringing some sense of resolution to that crisis increases.",207,,
1015,0.97,6955.948,6961.087,"And once again I want to reiterate, we are not police, we respect law enforcement, we are support a safety support.",207,,
1016,0.97,6961.087,6969.862,The next piece is training and professional development.,207,,
1017,0.97,6969.862,6971.13,We built in training all year round.,207,,
1018,0.97,6971.13,6980.54,We think that the greatest investment that we can place in this initiative is on the leaders of this initiative.,207,,
1019,0.97,6980.54,6993.453,"Because at the end of the day, initiatives and programs will end, but the leaders that we prepare through these initiatives will continue to be an asset to our communities, which leads me to my last piece, investment in black and Brown leadership.",207,,
1020,0.97,6993.453,7006.899,"It's extremely important that these are pathways to education and pathways to empowerment for our young black and Brown leaders that are engaging in this good and sacred work, right?",207,,
1021,0.97,7006.899,7014.34,It is important that we invest in the leadership.,207,,
1022,0.97,7014.34,7016.442,"Also, the leadership, I would be Remiss to say of our Elders.",207,,
1023,0.97,7016.442,7030.556,"It is time for us to invest in bringing us the voices and wisdom of our Elders to the space again so that it is balanced, and they have value, add value to this initiative.",207,,
1024,0.97,7030.556,7034.627,"And so these four key components we feel like are extremely intentional, and we are really excited to get going.",207,,
1025,0.97,7034.627,7039.532,"So with that, I will hand it back off to Tonya.",207,,
1026,0.97,7039.532,7039.766,Yes.,208,,
1027,0.97,7039.766,7050.777,It is Tanya Kim with the human services Department.,208,,
1028,0.97,7050.777,7053.579,"In the interest of time, I want to share with you what slides nine and 10 are.",208,,
1029,0.97,7053.579,7060.787,"We pulled some performance Metrics from the contract we have with community Passageways, that is subcontracts with these wonderful organizations.",208,,
1030,0.97,7060.787,7065.558,"And so together, that is the partnership that we have at this time, the partnership model.",208,,
1031,0.97,7065.558,7073.866,"And I can come back, or Dr.",208,,
1032,0.97,7073.866,7079.872,Helen can come back and get into the nuts and bolts of the contract and the element itself at a later time if that is your wish.,208,,
1033,0.97,7079.872,7083.709,But just highlighting a couple so we can get to some question and answer if there is time.,208,,
1034,0.97,7083.709,7108.134,"So question number one is, the initiative that the Hub providers are working with but looking at and rolling participants and having them on case management to create a service goal, plan, everything you can see from housing, education, you really want to intervene, but it's really, what's next?",208,,
1035,0.97,7108.134,7121.414,"And, another that I wanted to highlight is, of those participating in case management is that we do want to see a reported decrease in involvement in violence and general climb, and or feeling safe.",208,,
1036,0.97,7121.414,7131.958,"With the next slide, I will just highlight that part of, just underscoring what we were saying, they have been doing this work.",208,,
1037,0.97,7131.958,7142.768,And so what is different is really around the coordination as well.,208,,
1038,0.97,7142.768,7146.806,"Part of that is the coordination, what you should see, even though it is neighborhood based, there are going to be some unique aspects.",208,,
1039,0.97,7146.806,7150.143,There are going to be similarities as well.,208,,
1040,0.97,7150.143,7157.183,"Ordination without Trainings, coordination with our Seattle police Department, and coordination internally in just how data is shared and gathered.",208,,
1041,0.97,7157.183,7169.862,"And so I think with that, I will stop, Becausewe are short on time, and I wanted to, is there is some time, just giving more space back to our partners to field questions.",208,,
1042,0.97,7169.862,7171.297,Thank you.,209,,
1043,0.97,7171.297,7177.67,"I see that Council member Morales has a question, and Council member Lewis.",209,,
1044,0.97,7177.67,7178.037,Thank you.,210,,
1045,0.97,7178.037,7178.571,"Good morning, everyone.",210,,
1046,0.97,7178.571,7184.31,Thank you so much for being here.,210,,
1047,0.97,7184.31,7187.013,I first want to say that I agree with what Paul said.,210,,
1048,0.97,7187.013,7209.502,"It is really important, not just that we have black led organizations doing our work, that it is not just the larger, more established organizations that the smaller Community- based groups that are really doing a lot of the front line worker are also part of these solutions, so, thank you for that.",210,,
1049,0.97,7209.502,7214.24,I have a question about your work.,210,,
1050,0.97,7214.24,7224.584,"I know that so much of what you do particularly the through safe passage, I worked for a couple of years with Rainier Beach action coalition.",210,,
1051,0.97,7224.584,7242.435,"So I know the corner Greeter program is very similar to safe passage, and that has, as Marti said, really had an impact reducing crime, I think 35% was the number I saw over the past few years.",210,,
1052,0.97,7242.435,7247.94,"So we know that these programs work, and that they are an important part of helping our young people.",210,,
1053,0.97,7247.94,7256.549,"And I know that because of Covid, it has been hard to do that work.",210,,
1054,0.97,7256.549,7262.388,"I think, you know, just having folks out on the street right now is not something that we are able to do.",210,,
1055,0.97,7262.388,7276.802,"I feel that is at least part of why we have been seeing an increase in violence in the Rainier Beach area, and so I like to hear a little bit of thought, you know, your plans, until we are through Covid and can really start to ramp back up.",210,,
1056,0.97,7276.802,7283.876,"And then I have another just comment that I want to make, but I'd love to hear the plans for that right now first.",210,,
1057,0.97,7283.876,7295.921,"Well, as it relates to--, thank you, council member Morales.",211,,
1058,0.97,7295.921,7300.393,I like to relate it to the current climate of Covid which has been extremely confusing.,211,,
1059,0.97,7300.393,7302.628,"With the social distancing, et cetera.",211,,
1060,0.97,7302.628,7343.936,"But, one of the things that we are paying attention to is really being able to have that layer of safety in place, but also recognizing that there are situations in crisis response, or at least on behalf of the Perpetrators and the victims, where there is now social distancing from, you know, certain aspects and that safety piece, at least from that perspective, get thrown out the window.",211,,
1061,0.97,7343.936,7346.539,"However, I do think that is a very, kind of, sensitive topic.",211,,
1062,0.97,7346.539,7351.444,We will apply all current social distancing and Covid standards.,211,,
1063,0.97,7351.444,7379.772,"We will, though, at the same time, you know, train our staff to also, you know, be ready to respond to multiple aspects of the crisis response work which would be done on a consistent basis.",211,,
1064,0.97,7379.772,7380.306,Thank you.,212,,
1065,0.97,7380.306,7381.006,"Oh, sorry, go ahead.",212,,
1066,0.97,7381.006,7381.34,Sorry.,213,,
1067,0.97,7381.34,7387.513,"I just wanted to Chime in because I do want to make sure, I want to clarify that our safety teams are in place.",213,,
1068,0.97,7387.513,7409.402,"So in terms of Rainier Beach, safe passage, and I just want to clarify, safe passage is part of the collaboration around safe passage Separately, but I want to make sure it is understand, the rules for both of our teams are different.",213,,
1069,0.97,7409.402,7419.845,"And so, safe passage as part of this collaboration is addressing directly with the disturbances, De-Escalating these situations, which is not the role of corner Greeters.",213,,
1070,0.97,7419.845,7424.116,And so I want to make sure that part is clear.,213,,
1071,0.97,7424.116,7429.255,"But we have since, since the influx of violence that has happened, particularly Rainier Beach, started a healing space back in June.",213,,
1072,0.97,7429.255,7437.53,And saw that was to address the two Homicides that took place.,213,,
1073,0.97,7437.53,7447.973,And for our partner who we lost at that Rainier Beach parking lot safety.,213,,
1074,0.97,7447.973,7450.075,And so that is in response to that and a couple of others.,213,,
1075,0.97,7450.075,7452.778,I do want to say that we are currently operating and already responding.,213,,
1076,0.97,7452.778,7473.499,"This initiative allows for us to partner and align our efforts, so even if there is support, we are talking about, Hey, we need that manpower, we have that now with the other partners to be able to come in and align our efforts in that way.",213,,
1077,0.97,7473.499,7487.279,"I think it just builds capacity to be able to respond, and I think that there is also just not information out there for folks to know that we are already addressing what's happening, and those recent shootings that have taken place in our neighborhood.",213,,
1078,0.97,7487.279,7490.115,We have already addressed it and it's happening when we are not in the space.,213,,
1079,0.97,7490.115,7496.822,"And so we are Strategizing now to look at, Okay, when is this happening?",213,,
1080,0.97,7496.822,7512.972,"And I think that there is this response sometimes from the communities who are not involved to want to be, you know, Reactive and kind of reinvent.",213,,
1081,0.97,7512.972,7513.639,We have been out there.,213,,
1082,0.97,7513.639,7515.207,Our team has been out there in the payment.,213,,
1083,0.97,7515.207,7522.748,"Rainier Henderson, out there in the Safeway parking lot, and we have been collaborating with our partners in our neighborhood to address this issue.",213,,
1084,0.97,7522.748,7529.822,"It is something that does not happen overnight, because of the pandemic, there is nowhere for younger and older people to go because the bars and lounges are closed, and so we are addressing this issue.",213,,
1085,0.97,7529.822,7538.33,We are including the rest of the Seattle safety community partners to help in Strategizing around that.,213,,
1086,0.97,7538.33,7539.765,Hopefully that answers your question.,213,,
1087,0.97,7539.765,7540.533,"Yes, thank you.",214,,
1088,0.97,7540.533,7555.581,I know that we have all been getting plenty from our neighbors in Rainier Beach.,214,,
1089,0.97,7555.581,7559.752,"I know there's a lot of concern and we've got a couple of meetings scheduled, so I'm looking forward to having those conversations.",214,,
1090,0.97,7559.752,7574.7,"The last thing I do want to say is, first, I understand is this particular initiative came out of discussions around youth violins and interaction, so there is a particular framing for this work.",214,,
1091,0.97,7574.7,7581.607,"And, I worry that, as we talk more broadly about community safety, that that is the only framing.",214,,
1092,0.97,7581.607,7608.334,"And so especially as we move into the next agenda item here, I just want to say that it is important for us to be thinking about community safety, not just in terms of reducing gun violence or the challenges that some of our young people are having, but creating the kind of community conditions that lead to greater food security, nd more employment opportunities and greater access to health care and affordable housing.",214,,
1093,0.97,7608.334,7610.102,All of the things I think Paul sort of ran through.,214,,
1094,0.97,7610.102,7618.51,"A similar list of things that I think about when I think about what it means to have true community safety, and that is for our young people and our families to be able to thrive in place.",214,,
1095,0.97,7618.51,7632.958,"So I just want to be able to make sure that we are not taking too narrowly about what community safety means, even as we set up this initiative and support the work that you are all doing.",214,,
1096,0.97,7632.958,7638.764,"Thank you for saying that, council member Morales.",215,,
1097,0.97,7638.764,7639.832,Because we are intentional about that focus.,215,,
1098,0.97,7639.832,7642.034,It is not just about responding to incidents or looking at incidents.,215,,
1099,0.97,7642.034,7657.182,"We want to look at all of the underlying causes of those incidents, that Marginalization, that food security and, you know, mental health, addiction recovery.",215,,
1100,0.97,7657.182,7659.084,All of these things that lead to these incidents of violence.,215,,
1101,0.97,7659.084,7663.389,Úthank you for saying that because we are intentional about looking at all of these different aspects.,215,,
1102,0.97,7663.389,7665.157,And if I could make one more quick comment.,216,,
1103,0.97,7665.157,7710.903,"I just want to say, part of why I was struggling a little bit with the slides, and I think it's because I understand the framing for this, but the context of this work, that this is about, you know, the violence interruption work per se, that context isn't included in the slides, and so it would be easy for someone who isn't aware of the particular work you are doing here to Misconstrue, and I think about, you know, typically these sorts of presentations are Crafted and drafted by our Department, not by community.",217,,
1104,0.97,7712.604,7726.018,"And so you know, when I see things like trusted organizations and credible organizations, if I think that our Departents which are very often quite led are saying things about black led organizations, you know, these are trusted organizations, it makes me feel some kind of way.",217,,
1105,0.97,7726.018,7741.934,"And so, I just wanted to, you know, sort of State for the record that we know this is the work that is being Crafted in a very particular way for a particular reason, and I just appreciate all of you and the work that you are doing.",217,,
1106,0.97,7741.934,7761.386,"Rest assured, council member Morales, Marti Jackson and Paul Patu would never let us write our own presentation.",218,,
1107,0.97,7761.386,7761.854,"Amen, amen.",219,,
1108,0.97,7761.854,7763.455,They actually reorganized everything to highlight community.,220,,
1109,0.97,7763.455,7765.691,"So in this space, that's never anything you have to worry about.",220,,
1110,0.97,7765.691,7766.158,Thank you.,221,,
1111,0.97,7766.158,7767.192,"We are so, so over time.",221,,
1112,0.97,7767.192,7769.161,"Council member Lewis, do you have a question?",221,,
1113,0.97,7769.161,7775.3,"Yeah, I mean, I will just be really brief.",222,,
1114,0.97,7775.3,7784.376,I'm kind of curious because I have not thought about this before but it was raised in the presentation.,222,,
1115,0.97,7784.376,7786.912,"First I want to say, thank you everybody for the work that he was doing.",222,,
1116,0.97,7786.912,7791.416,"This is really fundamental to being a city that is investing in community led projects, and I just couldn't be more excited to continue this.",222,,
1117,0.97,7791.416,7801.894,"Whenever we have a phone call, I always look forward to that when you are on the schedule because I know we are going to talk about some really Impactful stuff.",222,,
1118,0.97,7801.894,7803.529,I wanted to say that at the beginning.,222,,
1119,0.97,7803.529,7808.2,"It was mentioned earlier when we were talking about the safety teams, there was a reference to the safety team training.",222,,
1120,0.97,7808.2,7813.839,I had an opportunity in the past just to ask exactly what the training entails.,222,,
1121,0.97,7813.839,7827.519,"So I thought I'd just ask that here in terms of the combination of training and experience that goes into being a safety team member, just out of curiosity.",222,,
1122,0.97,7827.519,7835.561,"That's it, and I don't think I'll have a follow-up in the interest of time, council member Herbold.",222,,
1123,0.97,7835.561,7835.961,Absolutely.,223,,
1124,0.97,7835.961,7838.864,And I think it is important to understand that this is dynamic.,223,,
1125,0.97,7838.864,7845.37,This is the culmination of expertise.,223,,
1126,0.97,7845.37,7851.577,"The Trainings were in part an investment firm, you know, different models, right?",223,,
1127,0.97,7851.577,7861.086,"So the first thing typical of the city is, you find the experts, and then you send people to go get trained in them.",223,,
1128,0.97,7861.086,7865.991,"So that has been kind of the Pathway, right?",223,,
1129,0.97,7865.991,7885.811,"So the investment for critical incident response which comes out of Shaw heights and safety protocol, which Akil Bashir trains on and Chantel and I have our own training and subject matter expertise around this work as well.",223,,
1130,0.97,7885.811,7900.025,"And so the culmination of the training is really, you know, from our Cachet of experience and experts in the fields related to, you referred to violence interruption.",223,,
1131,0.97,7900.025,7905.43,That is a model out of Cease- fire out of Chicago.,223,,
1132,0.97,7905.43,7928.22,"If you will, and plant yourself from the models, and really kind of trust the leaders that have absorbed the models on behalf of our context.",223,,
1133,0.97,7928.22,7929.554,Every city is going to be different.,223,,
1134,0.97,7929.554,7936.828,"You are going to learn best practices if you want, but the reality is, it takes practitioners from the community to implement things on behalf of our community.",223,,
1135,0.97,7936.828,7938.397,"The emphasis is really about people changing people, you know?",223,,
1136,0.97,7938.397,7942.834,And being able to empower black and Brown communities.,223,,
1137,0.97,7942.834,7960.319,"And I will reference an old adage from the black Panther era, in 2020, we have to be about training anyone, any young person that comes in our Pathway, and really live into indigenous leadership and indigenous ways.",223,,
1138,0.97,7960.319,7964.156,Thank you.,223,,
1139,0.97,7964.156,7971.296,"I just want to say, thank you.",224,,
1140,0.97,7971.296,7981.606,You are muted.,225,,
1141,0.97,7982.074,7983.075,Can you guys hear me now?,226,,
1142,0.97,7983.075,7983.408,Yes.,227,,
1143,0.97,7983.408,7984.609,"Okay, I want to close out.",228,,
1144,0.97,7984.609,7990.415,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",228,,
1145,0.97,7990.415,7991.817,Thank you all of the other Council members.,228,,
1146,0.97,7991.817,7993.185,I appreciate you letting us present to you guys.,228,,
1147,0.97,7993.185,7995.787,I want to say this is an opportunity to do something different and unique.,228,,
1148,0.97,7995.787,7997.122,You guys are part of this community.,228,,
1149,0.97,7997.122,7999.324,You guys are part of the community and have all worked together.,228,,
1150,0.97,7999.324,8001.626,"So, let's meet in the middle and heal our community together.",228,,
1151,0.97,8001.626,8005.63,What's the Hashtag?,229,,
1152,0.97,8005.63,8014.706,"Hashtag, community healing community.",230,,
1153,0.97,8014.706,8015.307,"Hashtag, move together.",231,,
1154,0.97,8015.307,8016.041,Thank you so much.,232,,
1155,0.97,8016.041,8018.91,I appreciate you guys taking time out to share your important work.,232,,
1156,0.97,8018.91,8032.858,"I appreciate hearing some echoes of the important work that has been done by investments in the city, such as the Seattle youth violence initiative.",232,,
1157,0.97,8032.858,8061.086,"I know there was a lot of frustration around the changes around that initiative to move away from a similar model we are going back to now which is really focused on learning and benefiting from the expertise of the community, and also breaking down silos and encouraging collaboration.",232,,
1158,0.97,8061.086,8078.103,"I have a couple of questions, I don't need them answered now, but I love to hear more about how referrals are received to Scsi.",232,,
1159,0.97,8078.103,8081.239,"How the community knows about your work, how they call you, and how to Prioritize your referrals.",232,,
1160,0.97,8081.239,8089.214,I would be interested to know more about how your community or work is communicated to the police Department.,232,,
1161,0.97,8089.214,8094.82,"Finally, I have a few questions about contract performance measures that I know Christina and my office can follow up on.",232,,
1162,0.97,8094.82,8111.67,"And with that, again, many, many thanks and gratitude for the important work that you guys are doing in the community, doing what you do, and lifting up and developing leadership in the effort to make safer communities.",232,,
1163,0.97,8111.67,8116.475,"So with that, Alex, can you read item number three into the agenda?",232,,
1164,0.97,8116.475,8130.288,"Agenda item number three, community capacity investment process.",233,,
1165,0.97,8130.288,8139.865,"So the last item we heard is how they were allocating $4 million in funding that the Council identified for the Seattle community safety initiative, an initiative developed by our community partners.",234,,
1166,0.97,8139.865,8145.337,"They came to us and said, Hey, we want support in funding this initiative.",234,,
1167,0.97,8145.337,8149.307,And so what we just heard is how those dollars were you used and how they are going to be used.,234,,
1168,0.97,8149.307,8168.393,"But we are hearing now is a very brief presentation on another part of dollars that the councils put aside in the 2020, rebalancing package.",234,,
1169,0.97,8168.393,8176.401,"And again, working to try to reduce our reliance on traditional policing . and this is the community capacity process.",234,,
1170,0.97,8176.401,8212.437,"Those investments have not gone out the door yet but I've invited Hst to give us a short briefing on what the progress is and the status is for getting those dollars out the door and developing this particular program which I think is really, has Foundational objectives of creating safer communities in a more Broadway than as Council member Morales was reflecting on, the violence reduction versus safer communities.",234,,
1171,0.97,8212.437,8226.351,I think this was intended to be a little bit more of a broader look at what makes safe communities.,234,,
1172,0.97,8230.922,8232.757,"Mayor Washington, are you going to take it away for us?",234,,
1173,0.97,8232.757,8240.532,"I was writing down what you said, the thanks for bringing us back this is a short overview on the $12 million that will be administered by Hs the.",235,,
1174,0.97,8240.532,8253.912,"And so, I believe that Tanya Kim, are you walking us through this presentation?",235,,
1175,0.97,8253.912,8254.446,"Yes, thank you.",236,,
1176,0.97,8254.446,8260.051,Helen is going to share with you what we are going to go over and I will take it away.,236,,
1177,0.97,8260.051,8295.52,"Council members, a few weeks ago, we forwarded to Council member Herbold a memo that provided an overview of the status of the community safety building investment, and so as Council member Herbold and the deputy Mayor has stated, we are just presenting an overview for community members and the viewing public to learn more about the Council approved 2021 investment process which includes the $12 million for Scaling up community organization.",237,,
1178,0.97,8295.52,8306.331,"Just want to thank you and the entire Council for your continued partnership on this work, and I will now turn it over to Tonya.",237,,
1179,0.97,8306.331,8307.666,"Okay, this will be quick and dirty.",238,,
1180,0.97,8307.666,8320.378,"With $12 million, I just wanted to highlight a couple of key aspect of the budget.",238,,
1181,0.97,8323.915,8329.688,"But before I do that, you know, just to reiterate the community and safety investment, we are really going for a broader Úapproach, and there are two benefits that I wanted to underscore.",238,,
1182,0.97,8329.688,8342.367,"One is that we are getting new or expanded services, and then Secondly, more Community-Based organizations we support, we will help to reduce the causes for providing better security community, resilience, and vitality.",238,,
1183,0.97,8342.367,8349.274,So we are zooming out a little bit from the presentation that we just heard previously.,238,,
1184,0.97,8349.274,8361.352,"With the budget of 12 million, we are estimating that there will be 1 million at $10.4 million in contracts to Community-Based organizations or groups to provide these new or expanded services, and there will be approximately 50%.",238,,
1185,0.97,8361.352,8375.967,"We are up to 1.6 million for administrative costs, such as things like external Evaluators, technical assistance, statements for the raiders with the request for proposal process, et cetera.",238,,
1186,0.97,8375.967,8379.404,We are not getting into the Nitty-Gritty of the Rfp because we are developing it.,238,,
1187,0.97,8379.404,8400.725,Those that know our request for proposal development process you know we start with community engagement.,238,,
1188,0.97,8400.725,8402.761,"At this time, Hsd is actively developing the proposal, guidelines, and application.",238,,
1189,0.97,8402.761,8406.097,"Rest assured, we are using existing community engagement that we have already procured, that you are Procuring, everybody's Procuring.",238,,
1190,0.97,8406.097,8419.444,"We are taking the analysis into consideration, but for this community engagement, we are Honing in on the needs of capacity building specific.",238,,
1191,0.97,8419.444,8428.453,"And so with that, we are having One-On-One conversations, Small- group conversations to understand what those capacity building needs are for our safety providers and it really is along the spectrum.",238,,
1192,0.97,8428.453,8450.742,"Conversations I community, academic experts, so I want to ensure you that we are talking with, for example, equitable development task force, specifically the regional approach to gun violence, and its impact on youth work group, cities United, and the others.",238,,
1193,0.97,8450.742,8456.781,"Hsd will ask our community providers many questions conduct specifically for this, we do want to ask them to see where they see themselves within the safety continuum, or, in what you are familiar with.",238,,
1194,0.97,8456.781,8467.392,"So, we are thinking about prevention, crisis response, intervention.",238,,
1195,0.97,8467.392,8470.795,Where do they see their programming or where do they see themselves?,238,,
1196,0.97,8470.795,8478.203,"Secondly, we want to know how they would contribute to a community led public service or solution.",238,,
1197,0.97,8478.203,8488.012,"Third, we are interested to know whether the response would replace a police function or be provided as a Co-Response with the police Department.",238,,
1198,0.97,8488.012,8494.285,"And Lastly, one of the known questions that we are going to ask is, if there service would be a response to violent or nonviolent crime.",238,,
1199,0.97,8494.285,8506.598,"So we are going to really have a stronger landscape analysis, and our plan is to come back to Council with some information in February.",238,,
1200,0.97,8506.598,8512.036,As we are akin to being the development of the Rfp.,238,,
1201,0.97,8512.036,8514.138,"So, I talk a lot about the Rfp.",238,,
1202,0.97,8514.138,8516.608,It is the way that we are doing be competitive funding process.,238,,
1203,0.97,8516.608,8526.718,"And so right now, we are focusing on Scaling of the existing organizations.",238,,
1204,0.97,8526.718,8530.822,We know that we need to save the organizations and then explore new strategies.,238,,
1205,0.97,8530.822,8537.529,"The bottom line is, with increased capacity, it means more services for people.",238,,
1206,0.97,8537.529,8555.28,"Capacity building, as you can imagine, is a broad definition, but we can imagine every organization and every neighborhood is different, and so we can expect requests for things like staffing support, financial management systems, a training around Database, et cetera.",238,,
1207,0.97,8555.28,8569.661,"Proposals will be reviewed by a panel of community members, and that community member or group will make funding recommendation to our Department director.",238,,
1208,0.97,8569.661,8576.567,"And Lastly, I just want to note that we do know there is urgency to release these funds as such the Rfp will be released March 1ST.",238,,
1209,0.97,8576.567,8582.373,Proposals are due April 9th.,238,,
1210,0.97,8582.373,8586.511,"Awards will be announced may 13th, and contracts will begin July 1ST.",238,,
1211,0.97,8586.511,8600.425,"And we've skipped ahead by showing you a slide that demonstrates that as well, really, for those of you that know our Department, this is expedited and we've got all hands on deck.",238,,
1212,0.97,8600.425,8606.464,"Going back to the performance measures, just a quick note to say that I know that is of interest.",238,,
1213,0.97,8606.464,8618.376,It is of interest to the community as well.,238,,
1214,0.97,8618.509,8622.08,"And so once the awards are made, we are going to be working with providers to identify the performance Metrics.",238,,
1215,0.97,8622.08,8624.248,"Because it is capacity building, organizations are going to be in different places.",238,,
1216,0.97,8624.248,8656.814,"We may start with some initial performance Metrics, for example, things like the increased services or the percentage of increased capacity as demonstrated by something like the improvement of management oversight but at the end of the day, we need to bring our children together along with other investments to work with an external Evaluator team to support the Cohort in their community led evaluation process.",238,,
1217,0.97,8656.814,8663.488,"And so together, we will agree on the outcomes we are trying to accomplish starting with short-term success that will lead us to long-term success, as well as identifying some common ways to measure it.",238,,
1218,0.97,8663.488,8670.962,"And those just missing back to that Timeline, underscoring again, some key dates.",238,,
1219,0.97,8670.962,8695.953,"And the next step for us is to return back to Council with some information with our preliminary landscape analysis and progress report, at which time you will also receive our spending plan to lift the reprisals.",238,,
1220,0.97,8695.953,8700.825,"From there, you can see we are going to release the request for proposal in March, and we are going to get us to a July 1ST contract start.",238,,
1221,0.97,8700.825,8701.826,And that is our brief update.,238,,
1222,0.97,8701.826,8704.395,There is a little bit more detail in the memo that is also provided.,238,,
1223,0.97,8704.395,8705.096,What questions do you have?,238,,
1224,0.97,8705.096,8706.297,Thank you so much.,238,,
1225,0.97,8706.297,8730.354,"Really, for she is the status update, and I appreciate that Timeline allows for continued Council engagement, and requires it, because there is a proviso included that we have to act with in order for these dollars to contractor Council member Morel, I see your hand is up.",238,,
1226,0.97,8730.354,8731.722,Or is that from before?,238,,
1227,0.97,8731.722,8736.861,"Yeah, thank you.",239,,
1228,0.97,8736.861,8755.079,"This sort of goes back to the point I was making before which is that I'm a little bit concerned about the framing or the priority here, seeming to be around violent and nonviolent crime, rather than thinking about community safety and public safety as broader and that.",239,,
1229,0.97,8755.079,8774.465,"And especially when I'm looking at this diagram one about the safety continuum, there is, it looks like prevention, and what I think of as some of those broader community safety conditions is not included in this.",239,,
1230,0.97,8774.465,8783.307,So I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about that question.,239,,
1231,0.97,8783.307,8801.893,"Well, part of the community engagement that I mentioned is, we are going to be sharing that diagram, and what you are referring to we don't have on the data deck for the viewing public, but it is in the memo.",240,,
1232,0.97,8801.893,8808.232,"And we are going to ask providers, or just as we connect with people, where they see themselves along that continuum, whether it is crisis response, et cetera.",240,,
1233,0.97,8808.232,8814.806,"And once we get some good information, it is, where do we see some gaps and where might we often focus?",240,,
1234,0.97,8814.806,8817.141,"Or, where there is a particular need based on what we are hearing.",240,,
1235,0.97,8817.141,8830.054,"And so for the conversation around safety, you are right, that prevention looks like it is hanging off the side, but, it depends on how we are defining prevention as well.",240,,
1236,0.97,8830.054,8834.559,"Are we talking upstream, where we want high-quality access to University preschool?",240,,
1237,0.97,8834.559,8845.57,Or are we talking about some immediate prevention interventions that might support people who would not further engage?,240,,
1238,0.97,8845.57,8852.443,"And so, that something we will further define.",240,,
1239,0.97,8852.443,8855.079,But your comment is noted and we've definitely got that down in mind.,240,,
1240,0.97,8855.079,8856.347,Thanks.,240,,
1241,0.97,8856.347,8857.048,"Yeah, thank you.",241,,
1242,0.97,8857.048,8859.283,"And I wanted to add a little bit, too.",241,,
1243,0.97,8859.283,8900.458,"I think the cancel's budget action that Aligns with this particular funding talks about community safety, and again, I think it is broader than the discussion we just had around, that's very focused on violence intervention, but may not be quite as broad as Maybe we would in retrospect like for this item, but, the action itself asked Hsd to make a proposed spending plan, organized around the intercept model framework for public safety.",241,,
1244,0.97,8900.458,8923.047,"So, this of investing in what's called intercept 0% is the kinds of things that will make it less likely that somebody has any interaction with the criminal justice system.",241,,
1245,0.97,8923.047,8928.452,And I think one of the things I'm really eager to see is what the recommendations are for the community on how much to invest in each intercept.,241,,
1246,0.97,8928.452,8939.397,"Because I think, I like you Council member Morel is, we are going to see a lot of interest in funding, intercept zero elements of this Timeline.",241,,
1247,0.97,8939.397,8960.084,"So again, this is just dipping our toe in on this investment, and I appreciate the acknowledgment from Hs the as it relates to the Timeline around getting these dollars out.",241,,
1248,0.97,8960.084,8970.995,My sense of urgency is in the recommendation of the Council's sense of urgency.,241,,
1249,0.97,8970.995,8986.844,"We voting three times on this funding between November and September of last year, first in a prison Council member--in our 2020 process, overturning the veto of it and appropriating funds within the 2021 budget.",241,,
1250,0.97,8986.844,9002.793,"And so, there was an expectation that Hsd would begin some of the work around developing the Rfp in 2020 and not waiting until the start of the new year.",241,,
1251,0.97,9002.793,9014.538,"And so, I think the sense of urgency is consistent with the Council's actions in the past and what we've expressed before.",241,,
1252,0.97,9014.538,9024.615,But I know Hsd will do the best it can with--within the confines and context of where we are in this moment.,241,,
1253,0.97,9024.615,9030.121,"Can I just ask her really quick, I think Council member Morel is, you are right.",242,,
1254,0.97,9030.121,9044.068,"In the words of Dr. Marshall who created the alive and free method, he sees the community as a system, and it is either a weak immune system or strong immune system.",242,,
1255,0.97,9044.068,9049.373,We need to strengthen the system of the community.,242,,
1256,0.97,9049.373,9055.546,"I don't think as a black woman, I mean, I think you are spot on in terms of we don't want to be seen as problems to be fixed.",242,,
1257,0.97,9055.546,9068.225,"If you invest in strengthening the immune system over time, you will decrease reliance on police interaction.",242,,
1258,0.97,9068.225,9080.471,"So I think using a strengths based approach may land better as well with community, when we do our community engagement to just say, what needs to be strengthened to ensure that you are better off five years from now?",242,,
1259,0.97,9080.471,9083.074,"So I just wanted to acknowledge that, and Council member Herbold, you can do both.",242,,
1260,0.97,9083.074,9091.615,"It is redefining community safety, right?",242,,
1261,0.97,9091.615,9092.817,Give us the resources we need to thrive.,242,,
1262,0.97,9092.817,9093.184,Right.,243,,
1263,0.97,9093.184,9094.585,And that's what capacity building is all about.,243,,
1264,0.97,9094.585,9100.291,It is about moving from a place of recognizing what the strengths of the community are and doubling down in our investments.,243,,
1265,0.97,9100.291,9101.625,"So, absolutely.",243,,
1266,0.97,9101.625,9113.003,"Start, I was just going to say really quickly, thank you, deputy Mayor Washington for those reflections.",244,,
1267,0.97,9113.003,9114.138,I think that's really important.,244,,
1268,0.97,9114.138,9126.717,"And what I was going to offer in terms of the sort of framing of the issue here is, I think right now we are in a little bit of a both and world.",244,,
1269,0.97,9126.717,9137.895,"Like, there is a need to engage in prevention work there is a need to engage in violence interruption work and I'm not hearing anyone suggest that we move away from doing those strategies.",244,,
1270,0.97,9137.895,9154.111,"And so I don't want to end today's presentation with sort of you all walking away with the impression that we want you to do less of those things, because I do think that community really wants those things as well.",244,,
1271,0.97,9154.111,9217.641,"And do appreciate the opportunity on the front end, you know, just mentioned that in reading your memo on page three, it does talk about those violence prevention issues, that some of the community indicators at the macro level in terms of Metrics, but we will see decrease in violence against young adults, decrease in 911 calls, decrease in violent crimes, decreasing interactions with police, decreased Recidivism, but then it also starts talking about the things that we do want to see on the positive side, not on the deficit side, which are increased resiliency strategies like Mentorship, cultural activities, community organizing, and increasing feelings of Connectedness, health, and hope as reported by the youth health survey and others and an increase in Preventions of safety.",244,,
1272,0.97,9217.641,9226.784,"And I think that is the upstream strategies that we would like to see invested in more significantly can be bolstered in the Metrics that we are looking for, right?",244,,
1273,0.97,9226.784,9230.354,"So, making sure that there is a balance there.",244,,
1274,0.97,9230.354,9243.634,"There is a lot of the decreased language in there and a lot less of the, what we want to see increased language in the memo that is laying out the strategies.",244,,
1275,0.97,9243.634,9252.343,"And so I just want to see some of those strategies that are framed in the positive, and the strength based context.",244,,
1276,0.97,9252.343,9279.737,"How can we create greater balance on that side of the ledger's so that folks understand that we are looking at it in a balanced way, both upstream, but also dealing with the reality of needing to decrease some of these other negative things that we are seeing happen in the community that doing continue to need a response and interaction of others.",244,,
1277,0.97,9279.737,9280.638,Thank you.,245,,
1278,0.97,9280.638,9296.287,I appreciate this important conversation and appreciate the work Hsd is doing in the community and really am so very humbled and grateful for the work the community is doing.,245,,
1279,0.97,9296.287,9306.33,"Alex, can you please read item 4 in the agenda and let folks know now that we are not going to get to item 5 on the agenda today?",245,,
1280,0.97,9306.33,9307.231,Alex?,245,,
1281,0.97,9307.231,9318.042,"Agenda item number four, discussion of less lethal weapons, draft bill, and recommendations on draft bill for discussion.",246,,
1282,0.97,9318.042,9318.409,Fantastic.,247,,
1283,0.97,9318.409,9320.11,Thank you so much.,247,,
1284,0.97,9320.11,9333.39,"So, this is the fourth meeting of the public safety and human services Committee on less lethal weapons.",247,,
1285,0.97,9333.39,9340.864,"On September 11th, the community police Commission, Inspector general, and the office of police account ability each presented their recommendations as it relates specifically to the bill that the council passed back in June.",247,,
1286,0.97,9340.864,9351.942,"On December 17th, there was a Roundtable discussion with the Accountabilities present as well as Seattle police Department present.",247,,
1287,0.97,9351.942,9362.686,"On January 12, the committee considered a draft bill that amended the bill adopted by the Council back in June, based on some of the consensus recommendations of the three accountability bodies.",247,,
1288,0.97,9362.686,9366.49,And then we considered a decision agenda for the accountability bodies had varied recommendations.,247,,
1289,0.97,9366.49,9383.073,"The intent for today is for the committee to vote, which will in essence be a recommendation.",247,,
1290,0.97,9383.073,9393.884,"Again, the Council's legal Council would then send the draft legislation to the monitor and the Department of justice in line with the process described in the consent decree and required by Judge Robart in his temporary retaining order.",247,,
1291,0.97,9393.884,9412.069,"Under the consent decree, the court ordered the client up pointed monitor can approve the proposal or determined that conflicts with the terms of the consent decree agreement.",247,,
1292,0.97,9412.069,9415.806,"If the city or the Department of justice object to the monitor's determination, they can meet and confer with the monitor.",247,,
1293,0.97,9415.806,9417.007,"And if they choose, petition the court.",247,,
1294,0.97,9417.007,9423.147,"Ultimately, the court approval is needed for an ordinance to go into effect.",247,,
1295,0.97,9423.147,9430.954,"If we don't have court approval, we will not have a regulation related to the use of less lethal weapons.",247,,
1296,0.97,9430.954,9444.835,"So ultimately, approval is needed and full council action will take place after the completion of the consent decree process.",247,,
1297,0.97,9444.835,9461.985,"Of course, this is very different than the standard process for legislation laid out under the Charter, and under the terms of the consent decree, the Council cannot override the decision of the monitor or court on legislation regarding the use of force.",247,,
1298,0.97,9461.985,9479.002,"Judge Robart specifically expressed an intent in hearing from the three account ability bodies as did the Council in the ordinance that we passed in June, and this is a key reason that the committee has met twice to hear, discuss, and ask questions about the accountability recommendation.",247,,
1299,0.97,9479.002,9480.037,Accountability body must give recommendation.,247,,
1300,0.97,9480.037,9485.642,And that's why the discussion Tday and in past meetings has been structured specifically around their recommendations.,247,,
1301,0.97,9485.642,9500.724,"Again, in the July temporary restraining order, I think it is important to be aware of some of the comments that Judge Robart made when he issued this restraining order prohibiting this from going into effect.",247,,
1302,0.97,9500.724,9510.534,"He was critical of the ordinance adopted in June by the Council, saying it does not increase public safety.",247,,
1303,0.97,9510.534,9526.316,"Given that for any Council legislation regarding the use of force to go into effect we have to note this perspective, we have to keep it in mind, because it could be a signal that he would be unlikely to authorize the legislation adopted by the Council last June.",247,,
1304,0.97,9526.316,9536.26,"So Ideally, we would have been able to take up this legislation for action during 2020, after the July restraining order was put into place.",247,,
1305,0.97,9536.26,9555.879,"However, due to the need to revise the 2020 budget due to the panic and then the regular two month 2021 budget process, only the budget committee has been able to hold hearings, and we've just been able to get to this this year.",247,,
1306,0.97,9555.879,9559.483,I just want to also address some of the things that we heard in public comments.,247,,
1307,0.97,9559.483,9570.994,Somebody referred to the way that the TRO was put into place.,247,,
1308,0.97,9570.994,9583.74,"It is important I think to recognize that the court rejected the motion of the Mayor and chief, and the TRO was put into place in response to a motion by the Department of justice.",247,,
1309,0.97,9583.74,9603.327,"So, I think some people are suggesting that the reason we have a TRO in place is because of an action taken by the Mayor, and that is not accurate according to the record of how we got here.",247,,
1310,0.97,9603.327,9639.396,"I have heard many people refer to the chemical weapons convention adopted by the United Nations, and the prohibitions against the use of less lethal weapons, that have chemical irritants, those conventions do specify that purpose is not prohibited under the convention includes law enforcement, including domestic riot control purposes.",247,,
1311,0.97,9639.396,9656.88,And I think what our purpose here today is to really work to tighten current SPD policy about how they interpret the right to use these weapons in domestic riot control purposes.,247,,
1312,0.97,9656.88,9677.901,"And so with that, I think I want to hand it over to central staff, talk us through a Powerpoint presentation.",247,,
1313,0.97,9677.901,9679.169,"Lise Kaye, I'll hand it over to you.",247,,
1314,0.97,9679.169,9679.97,"Thank you, Madam chair.",248,,
1315,0.97,9679.97,9683.607,I'm sorry to say that my camera which worked when I logged in this morning decided to stop working.,248,,
1316,0.97,9683.607,9685.475,I'm going to test to see if I can share my screen.,248,,
1317,0.97,9685.475,9686.91,"For some reason, I can't.",248,,
1318,0.97,9686.91,9692.182,I sent the presentation so that I can run it.,248,,
1319,0.97,9692.182,9696.019,"I'm just a little annoyed here, but let's try sharing my screen here.",248,,
1320,0.97,9696.019,9703.326,Let's see whether you can see that.,248,,
1321,0.97,9703.326,9706.596,Is that coming up for you all?,248,,
1322,0.97,9706.596,9708.098,"Yes, it is.",249,,
1323,0.97,9708.098,9710.734,That's Grand.,250,,
1324,0.97,9710.734,9721.278,"Okay, everything is good then.",250,,
1325,0.97,9723.513,9725.148,"All right, so thank you so much, Madam chair.",250,,
1326,0.97,9725.148,9731.822,"With your permission then, I'm going to bring up what was in the base bill, what was in the revised space bill, and how these compared to the original ordinance that is subject to that temporary restraining order.",250,,
1327,0.97,9731.822,9733.056,"Actually, temporary injunction at this point.",250,,
1328,0.97,9733.056,9746.169,"So, I'm going to skip forward here.",250,,
1329,0.97,9748.105,9761.017,"So, taking you back to your December 17th committee meeting, the committee discussed a base bill that was built around four areas of consensus from the three accountability agencies . Those were the community public--on Sarcoma community police division, office of the inspector general and office of police accountability.",250,,
1330,0.97,9761.017,9773.83,"Three of the areas of consensus were to allow specific, Non- crowd control uses of pepper spray, 40 millimeter launchers, and noise flash devices.",250,,
1331,0.97,9773.83,9789.613,"Before the area of consensus was to ban control use of tear gas, and there's an Asterisk on this because it means we drafted the base bill as a complete ban on Teargas because there was not consensus among the account ability agencies for what a partial ban would look like.",250,,
1332,0.97,9789.613,9802.559,This is going to make more sense to you a little later in the presentation.,250,,
1333,0.97,9803.059,9806.763,"At your January 12th committee meeting, you discussed whether you'd want to expand the base bill beyond these areas of consensus.",250,,
1334,0.97,9806.763,9811.101,And that discussion has informed what we are calling the revised base bill.,250,,
1335,0.97,9811.101,9815.405,The revised bill then would ban some less lethal weapons and would impose conditions on the use of others.,250,,
1336,0.97,9815.405,9824.514,So I'm going to walk you through that right now.,250,,
1337,0.97,9824.514,9834.991,"So, as to the less lethal weapons that would be banned, the revised base bill would ban 40 millimeter launchers when used to deploy chemical irritants from crowd control in any demonstration.",250,,
1338,0.97,9834.991,9842.732,It would ban noise flash diversionary devices for any crowd control or demonstration.,250,,
1339,0.97,9842.732,9868.992,"It would ban Teargas or chemical irritants and pepper spray, and banned acoustic weapons, directed energy weapons, water Cannons, Disorientation devices, including blast balls, ultrasonic Cannons, and any other device primarily designed to be used on multiple individuals for crowd control and to cause pain or discomfort.",250,,
1340,0.97,9868.992,9886.71,"Lisa, I'm confused about, and item 4, about the exception for noise flash diversionary devices as not being banned.",251,,
1341,0.97,9886.71,9892.015,"And I understand as explained in number two, that they are banned in the revised base bill.",251,,
1342,0.97,9892.015,9893.416,They are banned.,252,,
1343,0.97,9893.416,9908.031,"There are some conditions that are being established that would ban them, or apply to their use outside any demonstration or rally, so you'll see that in my next slide.",252,,
1344,0.97,9908.031,9908.298,Right.,253,,
1345,0.97,9908.298,9919.743,"But it seems that item 4 combines items that there is a total ban, and items for which there is not a total ban but can be used under certain circumstances.",253,,
1346,0.97,9919.743,9940.864,"I believe the bill includes a total ban under any circumstances for acoustic weapons, directed energy weapons, water Cannons, Disorientation devices including ultrasonic Cannons, but it does not include a total ban for Non-Flash diversionary devices.",253,,
1347,0.97,9940.864,9949.072,"Because that was one of the requests from the accountability bodies, to allow it for Swot circumstances.",253,,
1348,0.97,9949.072,9949.506,That's right.,254,,
1349,0.97,9949.506,9951.775,And I'm going to cover that a little bit later.,254,,
1350,0.97,9951.775,9954.444,"Okay, thank you.",255,,
1351,0.97,9954.444,9960.483,"Okay, so moving to the next slide here.",256,,
1352,0.97,9960.483,9963.653,The revised base bill would impose a set of specific conditions on some of the less lethal weapons.,256,,
1353,0.97,9963.653,9970.86,This slide shows the conditions that would be applied to pepper spray.,256,,
1354,0.97,9970.927,9982.505,"O specifically, pepper Spra may not be used for crowd control in a nonviolent demonstration or rally, and only special weapons or tactics officers, the S.W.A.T.",256,,
1355,0.97,9982.505,9987.01,"Team, made to play pepper products using a 40 millimeter launcher and only for purposes other than crowd control in a demonstration or rally.",256,,
1356,0.97,9987.01,9999.723,"And finally, pepper spray may only be deployed in circumstances of which the risk of serious injury from violent actions outweighs the risk of harms devices used.",256,,
1357,0.97,9999.723,10008.932,The next set of limitations.,256,,
1358,0.97,10008.932,10013.737,The specific conditions on the deployment of noise flash diversionary devices.,256,,
1359,0.97,10013.737,10014.404,"So specifically, only S.W.A.T.",256,,
1360,0.97,10014.404,10020.11,"Officers may deploy these devices, and S.W.A.T.",256,,
1361,0.97,10020.11,10034.324,Can use them only for purposes other than crowd control in a demonstration.,256,,
1362,0.97,10038.395,10042.899,Slide six shows that the revised base bill would show that mutual partners operate under the same policies as SPD with respect to less people weapons.,256,,
1363,0.97,10042.899,10049.339,The language is carried on from ordinances one through six and the--bill.,256,,
1364,0.97,10049.339,10063.086,"The revised bill would also add the recommendation of the city attorney modify the right of action clause to read that it would exclude a person who, in judgment of a reasonable person commits a criminal offense at or Immedately prior to the use of less lethal force.",256,,
1365,0.97,10063.086,10078.201,It would also set the effective date of the ordinance at 30 days after the course review and approval.,256,,
1366,0.97,10078.201,10094.884,"So the next two slides compare policies across the initial ordinance, the base bill, and the revised base bill, and I just ask you, Madam chair, I know time is short.",256,,
1367,0.97,10094.884,10099.222,Do you want me to walk through these tables or come back to them in the event that they become applicable to the discussion?,256,,
1368,0.97,10099.222,10099.823,I think the latter.,257,,
1369,0.97,10099.823,10108.798,"Coming back to them, if we need to talk about an optional and see what the original ordinance said about it . I this is a good ordinance to have.",257,,
1370,0.97,10108.798,10122.412,"I do want to again state that in my mind, we've always known that we were going to be in this place of having to Revisit the ordinance.",257,,
1371,0.97,10122.412,10126.149,"We included an amendment, two amendments, and ordinance 126- 102.",257,,
1372,0.97,10126.149,10142.465,"One ordinance asking that the accountability partners report back to us on their recommendations as it related to the bill by August 2020, and the other asking the city attorney to submit the ordinance with the court.",257,,
1373,0.97,10142.465,10160.55,"So, I construct, we have acknowledged in the original bill that we might need to Revisit the bill.",257,,
1374,0.97,10160.55,10180.37,"I don't know that we all expected that there would be a temporary restraining order placed on the implementation of the bill while we considered the input of the court, or the accountability partners, but we have made the commitment to consider that input, and now implementation of our regulation is contingent on our consideration of that input.",257,,
1375,0.97,10180.37,10199.589,"So, I just think it is important to ground this discussion today in what we knew and planned for in ordinance 126-102.",257,,
1376,0.97,10200.29,10200.59,Okay.,258,,
1377,0.97,10200.59,10217.24,"I'm just going to show you so that I know that you have it here coming up, this is the second half of that comparison, and there is also a table here that shows how the provisions of the revised base bill compared to the oversight agency month initial positions on banning less lethal weapons.",258,,
1378,0.97,10217.24,10221.344,You saw that at both of your previous meetings.,258,,
1379,0.97,10221.344,10225.148,"So at this point, that COMPLETES my report.",258,,
1380,0.97,10225.148,10225.648,Thank you.,259,,
1381,0.97,10225.648,10252.508,"And so in the last meeting, I stated sort of what the new base bill was going to strive to do and how I was going to make an effort to make sure that it captured the committee discussion.",259,,
1382,0.97,10252.508,10255.078,It largely did that and did address some things that we did not discuss in committee.,259,,
1383,0.97,10255.078,10265.588,"Thank you, Lisa, for lifting that up specifically as it relates to receipt of some of the law Department's advice around the private rate of action and the effective date of ordinance.",259,,
1384,0.97,10265.588,10292.115,"I made a commitment in last week's meeting because it was very apparent to me that there was strong disagreement of whether or not we should maintain the total ban on Teargas, or whether or not we should look at trying to regulate or create narrow conditions for the allowance of the use of Teargas.",259,,
1385,0.97,10292.115,10324.047,"And so, you know, in the recognition that I believe there was an interest in discussing those two options, the base bill maintains the total ban as contemplated by the ordinance we passed last summer, and I have brought forward an amendment that creates the allowance for use of Teargas in the narrow circumstances.",259,,
1386,0.97,10324.047,10340.329,"And so, Lisa, do you want to go over all of the amendments that we have first, very quickly, high-level?",259,,
1387,0.97,10340.329,10341.998,And then we can go over the individual ones.,259,,
1388,0.97,10341.998,10342.332,Certainly.,260,,
1389,0.97,10342.332,10354.544,"So, did you want to--so, I've got both amendment one and a potential amendment 1-a, and then Council member Sawant has amendments.",260,,
1390,0.97,10354.544,10354.911,Thank you.,261,,
1391,0.97,10354.911,10364.087,"I explained the background on that one, and if you want to go a little bit more into the detail that would be great.",261,,
1392,0.97,10364.087,10389.078,"Chair Herbold, I have some comments to make before we talk about amendments, because we haven't really even gone over that one slide that talks about what this new bill does, not only in reference to the original ordinance that was passed last summer, but in comparison with what you summarized at the last committee.",262,,
1393,0.97,10389.078,10397.053,With what you call the base bill that was presented last evening which the public never got to see.,262,,
1394,0.97,10397.053,10423.646,"As far as my knowledge is concerned, other than the Email that went out from my office, that so-called base bill is actually not only remarkably different from the ordinance that was passed last summer but contains limits of what was not discussed at all in the last comedy.",262,,
1395,0.97,10423.646,10434.157,"So I say that given that this committee has so little time left, it is 12:24 now, the committee that I'm sharing, the Sustainability committee that is at 2:00 P.M.",262,,
1396,0.97,10434.157,10437.226,"Today, we get ready for that, I ask that this not be ran through today.",262,,
1397,0.97,10437.226,10443.266,"As I said, this bill was sent to Council members themselves last evening which was less than 24 hours ago.",262,,
1398,0.97,10443.266,10467.99,"And as far as I know, it wasn't formally used or linked on the agenda . and you said repeatedly that you are consulting with what you call accountability partners, and my accountability partners are working class people, regular people, and they have not had a chance to see a lot of the aspects of it.",262,,
1399,0.97,10467.99,10473.329,So I wanted to speak to those for a few minutes.,262,,
1400,0.97,10473.329,10490.713,"I said at the last committee meeting two weeks ago that I have been happy to support legislation on an amendment to support ending the injunction so that the bill could go into effect, but that cannot be an excuse to create giant loopholes allowing police to continue abusing left movements like the black lives matter movement.",262,,
1401,0.97,10490.713,10498.287,"The bill in front of us creates Militarized weapons, the police are banned from using it.",262,,
1402,0.97,10498.287,10504.927,"It also removes almost all enforcement, even when the law has been broken.",262,,
1403,0.97,10504.927,10513.202,The Oriinal ban that my office offered in the Blm movement last summer created among other things a right of action.,262,,
1404,0.97,10513.202,10531.42,"And you mentioned this, and I want to speak to it, so that in time police broke the law and it can sue the city for $10,000, the political establishment may not be serious about holding police accountable, but the reason we put that in is because when money is involved, they become emotional around avoiding lawsuits.",262,,
1405,0.97,10531.42,10535.758,But this right of action was the only thing that would have actually enforced the ban.,262,,
1406,0.97,10535.758,10551.374,"We saw this last fall, continuing to abuse the police with tear gas, police and ignore the injunction and continued using these weapons.",262,,
1407,0.97,10551.374,10558.581,"This isn't just me saying that the police violated the injunction, but what was the consequence?",262,,
1408,0.97,10558.581,10559.081,Nothing at all.,262,,
1409,0.97,10559.081,10560.383,"Of course, that is the whole point.",262,,
1410,0.97,10560.383,10565.588,Police violated the injunction and they knew that there was not going to be any enforcement.,262,,
1411,0.97,10565.588,10584.206,"And today's bill has been presented as necessary to make it more likely that it was approved by Judge Robart over seeing the consent decree but I don't agree with that characterization at all because the city of Seattle has made no efforts so far to actually ask them to approve the ordinance as is, which is what the vast majority of people in Seattle want.",262,,
1412,0.97,10584.206,10590.579,"So, I don't accept that all of these loopholes are needed, because the consent decree requires it.",262,,
1413,0.97,10590.579,10603.793,"But even if it were true, why is this new bill removing the private right of action, the private right of action is totally unrelated to any of those questions?",262,,
1414,0.97,10603.793,10604.493,The only reason --,262,,
1415,0.97,10604.493,10611.334,"Council member Sawant, the bill does not remove the private right of action.",263,,
1416,0.97,10611.334,10612.234,Let me just finish.,264,,
1417,0.97,10612.234,10614.437,"You are free to--it is your Committee, you're free to --",264,,
1418,0.97,10614.437,10617.206,I just want to make that clarification.,265,,
1419,0.97,10617.206,10626.816,"I'm not trying to stop you from talking, but the base bill does not remove the private right of action.",265,,
1420,0.97,10626.816,10631.954,The private right of action is the only thing that people have to hold the police accountable.,266,,
1421,0.97,10631.954,10644.233,"The problem is that the bill that you have provided, it just Bunches massive loopholes into the private right of action.",266,,
1422,0.97,10644.233,10650.039,It is the action of what ordinary people are actually able to do in private right of action.,266,,
1423,0.97,10650.039,10653.042,"It's not whether, you know, formally in the right of law that private right of action exists.",266,,
1424,0.97,10653.042,10658.08,"That's not the standard by which we should measure, but that people actually have private right of action.",266,,
1425,0.97,10658.08,10660.216,"And also, let's also look at some facts.",266,,
1426,0.97,10660.216,10670.092,"I mean, I don't think that what was characterized as a process leading through is just completely accurate.",266,,
1427,0.97,10670.092,10687.109,"The reality is that soon after our movement won this ordinance last summer, Mayor Durkan and former chief best, with the assistance of the city attorney's office shamefully try to reveal the ban and stop it from being implemented.",266,,
1428,0.97,10687.109,10689.211,It was to effectively get a temporary restraining order against the ban.,266,,
1429,0.97,10689.211,10707.129,"As you correctly said, yes, Judge Robart refused at first, but then just days later, the temporary restraining order for the junction was granted in response to a request from the Department, just as you are right, but the Attorney joined the effort so it is not accurate to say that the Mayor's administration did not play a role in this.",266,,
1430,0.97,10707.129,10729.618,"But regardless, you know, I don't agree that the role of the highest legislative body of the city is to water down legislation, really got principal element of what's happening here, that it is essential to lifting the restrictions so that the legislation can go into effect.",266,,
1431,0.97,10729.618,10734.457,"It's true that while the ban has not been struck down, it cannot be enforced if the legal restrictions are lifted.",266,,
1432,0.97,10734.457,10734.89,That's accurate.,266,,
1433,0.97,10734.89,10747.636,"But as I said last time as well, there is no evidence to indicate they are demanding the legislation to be watered down.",266,,
1434,0.97,10747.636,10761.05,"As I believe community member Leah Buck said in public comment, it just seems Counterintuitive and sort of Mind-Boggling that the ban would be opposed to a consent decree that would place where the serious investigation was called for in the first place, into the excessive use of force by police.",266,,
1435,0.97,10761.05,10782.505,"But even if there was evidence that the code demanding that legislation be watered down, shouldn't self professed public police members be fighting against the ban and put a lot of pressure on the public court to approve a legislation that is needed, given the, just example of example of systematic violence from the police?",266,,
1436,0.97,10782.505,10795.284,"But instead, it seems the most of you are getting ready to make an offer to the court to--the ban.",266,,
1437,0.97,10795.284,10798.087,The city has not made an attempt yet to have those restrictions lifted.,266,,
1438,0.97,10798.087,10807.429,"And so, I mean, the bottom line is, we don't expect the courts ad police under capitalism to be on our side.",266,,
1439,0.97,10807.429,10816.405,So what we need is elected representatives who will fight for the strongest possible legislation.,266,,
1440,0.97,10816.405,10822.044,"And I appreciate the discussion that is going to happen on amendments, but as lise Kaye said, my office is bringing amendments to restore the strong enforcement in the private right of action.",266,,
1441,0.97,10822.044,10822.411,Thank you.,266,,
1442,0.97,10822.411,10829.652,"Thank you, council member Sawant.",267,,
1443,0.97,10829.652,10839.962,"I'm very pessimistic that we are going to get through all of our amendments and the discussion at this point, given that a number of us have another meeting that starts in 15 minutes, four of us.",267,,
1444,0.97,10839.962,10840.196,Yeah.,267,,
1445,0.97,10840.196,10856.779,"So, what I like, though, is I like if lise Kaye could describe the amendments that have been proposed, and to maybe go back to the base bill.",267,,
1446,0.97,10856.779,10860.316,"I thought between you and I, we did explain what was in the base bill.",267,,
1447,0.97,10860.316,10873.095,"But, it sounds like Council member Sawant still has some add additional needs for more detail.",267,,
1448,0.97,10873.095,10888.077,"So, perhaps if we could just do those two things before we end today's meeting, and we will bring back the vote on the amendments at the next meeting.",267,,
1449,0.97,10888.077,10888.41,Okay.,268,,
1450,0.97,10888.41,10898.02,I will--the first two amendments would--the first one would--let me just pull these up.,268,,
1451,0.97,10898.02,10908.264,My apologies.,268,,
1452,0.97,10908.764,10936.125,"The first amendment would allow the use of tear gas when used for crowd control in violent public disturbances, and it also then defines a violent public disturbance as any gathering where 12 or more persons who are present together use or threaten to use unlawful violence toward another person or group of people in the conduct of them taken together is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness, the precedent seemed to fear for their personal safety pick that's really hard to absorb . I apologize.",268,,
1453,0.97,10936.125,10963.252,"So amendment one would allow the use of tear gas for crowd control and public violent disturbances, but only when deployed under direction of offices who received direction of training for its use within 12 months and use of tactical plan developed prior to deployment, and the use is reasonably necessary to prevent threat of imminent loss of life or serious harm or injury.",268,,
1454,0.97,10963.252,10979.702,These exceptions would not be authorized until the SPD's annual use of policy is reviewed by a consent decree.,268,,
1455,0.97,10979.702,10999.655,"And as a point of information, those use of force policy reviews are going on simultaneously to our legislative discussions, and I believe the--they are supposed to be imposing changes to the use of force policies in early February.",269,,
1456,0.97,10999.655,11010.199,I believe it is February 11th.,269,,
1457,0.97,11015.804,11019.041,"And so, that will have to go through the consent decree process, the same process I described earlier.",269,,
1458,0.97,11019.041,11034.223,"And so, the effective date of the ordinance and, the restrictions around Teargas would go into effect after that time.",269,,
1459,0.97,11034.723,11042.931,"And so, I just want to underscore that currently, we don't have any instructions in law on the use of less lethal weapons and unless the court authorizes a Council bill, we will not.",269,,
1460,0.97,11042.931,11045.267,"Okay, amendment one a is kind of a provisional amendment.",270,,
1461,0.97,11045.267,11095.884,"If amendment one passes, the law Department said that given the adopted definition for allowing Teargas to be used in a public demonstration, they would amend the right of action clause to set the--or basically, to prohibit any person whose participation in a violent public disturbance prior to or during the use of less lethal weapon would cause the person of reasonable firmness processed at the scene for fear for his personal safety not covered--such preventing, prohibiting someone who was involved in the violent public disturbance from recovering damages and court costs through his right of action.",270,,
1462,0.97,11095.884,11105.727,"So, Lisa, how does that differ from the language in the base bill that I proposed relating to the private right of action?",271,,
1463,0.97,11105.727,11132.054,"It is just somewhat different definition in terms of--it specifically says that the person participating in a violent public disturbance would not be eligible as opposed to the previous language would have, somebody participated or committing a crime.",272,,
1464,0.97,11132.054,11149.972,"And so, it seems whether or not someone has committed a crime is a brighter line for not allowing somebody to recover money in a private right of action.",273,,
1465,0.97,11149.972,11156.712,Whether or not somebody has committed a crime is a brighter line for exclusion than participating in a violent disturbance.,273,,
1466,0.97,11156.712,11171.36,It seems like that would be more consistent with what Council member Sawant described as a potential loophole.,273,,
1467,0.97,11171.36,11188.31,"But, I could see why it might give the Attorney a little bit more comfort as it relates to sort of this dirty hands concept.",273,,
1468,0.97,11188.31,11188.677,Sorry.,274,,
1469,0.97,11188.677,11204.56,"Just as a clarification, are we discussing what you are calling amendment 1-a? and if so, could the language be shared on the screen?",274,,
1470,0.97,11204.56,11207.596,I'm not sure I've seen it so I'm a little bit confused as to what we are discussing.,274,,
1471,0.97,11207.596,11213.936,"Okay, did you want me to show amendment 1 or 1-a? I think number one was distributed.",275,,
1472,0.97,11213.936,11214.703,1 has been distributed.,276,,
1473,0.97,11214.703,11216.705,It is 1-a that I think is new to many of us.,276,,
1474,0.97,11216.705,11222.21,My challenge is going to be whether this is going to be small enough for you to see.,277,,
1475,0.97,11222.21,11226.348,Are you looking at it now?,277,,
1476,0.97,11226.348,11239.661,"Does it say, Facebook opposed amendment 1-a?",277,,
1477,0.97,11239.661,11239.928,Yes.,278,,
1478,0.97,11239.928,11240.228,Okay.,279,,
1479,0.97,11240.228,11246.568,So I'm not quite sure how to zoom.,279,,
1480,0.97,11246.568,11247.135,It is one page.,279,,
1481,0.97,11247.135,11247.469,I'm sorry.,279,,
1482,0.97,11247.469,11249.171,I'm going to Scroll down through it so you'll see.,279,,
1483,0.97,11249.171,11262.951,"This is the language that would--what you are calling the dirty hands privilege, that would prevent a person who was part of a violent or public disturbance from participating.",279,,
1484,0.97,11262.951,11263.952,And I will Scroll back up.,279,,
1485,0.97,11263.952,11269.391,"So, that is basically the language.",279,,
1486,0.97,11269.391,11279.268,"And, you know, again, I'm comfortable with the language that is in the base bill.",280,,
1487,0.97,11279.268,11282.704,I agree to bring this forward for purposes of conversation because it was the request of the city attorney's office.,280,,
1488,0.97,11282.704,11291.813,"I'm not committed to moving and forward because as I said, I am comfortable with the language in the base bill.",280,,
1489,0.97,11291.813,11300.122,"And if there are no questions about this amendment, we can quickly go over Council member Sawant's amendment and convene.",280,,
1490,0.97,11300.122,11311.4,"So, amendments 4A, 4B1 and 4B2 are variations.",281,,
1491,0.97,11311.4,11319.941,4B1 and 4B2 are variations on amendment four.,281,,
1492,0.97,11319.941,11323.245,It would take the rights of violations back to the language that was in ordinance 126.102.,281,,
1493,0.97,11323.245,11325.347,"Does that seem accurate to you, council member Sawant?",281,,
1494,0.97,11325.347,11328.116,Is that the description you would use?,281,,
1495,0.97,11328.116,11338.226,Yes.,282,,
1496,0.97,11338.226,11341.163,Would it be okay with the chair if I said a few words about the amendment?,282,,
1497,0.97,11341.163,11341.53,Absolutely.,283,,
1498,0.97,11341.53,11348.87,I can also share it on the screen if you'd like.,284,,
1499,0.97,11348.87,11350.972,"That would also be good, in addition to what I'm saying.",285,,
1500,0.97,11350.972,11351.473,Thank you.,286,,
1501,0.97,11351.473,11353.909,I want to make note that Council member Lewis has a comment as well.,286,,
1502,0.97,11353.909,11354.176,Yes.,286,,
1503,0.97,11354.176,11355.077,Council member Sawant.,286,,
1504,0.97,11355.077,11360.182,Thank you.,287,,
1505,0.97,11360.182,11361.783,This amendment will restore the private right of action.,287,,
1506,0.97,11361.783,11364.553,"As I said, that is the only real enforcement of the ban on crowd control weapons.",287,,
1507,0.97,11364.553,11377.432,"Police officers are not held individually accountable, partially because the decision to use these chemical and other chemical lies weapons is usually made at the top, not by the individual officer.",287,,
1508,0.97,11377.432,11382.604,But more because the police are virtually never held accountable for abusing Left- wing and peaceful protesters.,287,,
1509,0.97,11382.604,11384.206,"I mean, that is just a statistically established fact.",287,,
1510,0.97,11384.206,11391.313,This is just what happens.,287,,
1511,0.97,11391.313,11393.515,"It's not about theory, but this is actually what happens in real life.",287,,
1512,0.97,11393.515,11398.52,The legislation of the council passed last summer holds the city establishment accountable.,287,,
1513,0.97,11398.52,11409.331,"If the police fill the streets with Teargas and explosives, the infected protesters can sue for $10,000 each.",287,,
1514,0.97,11409.331,11412.534,The reason we put that in is because that is a real consequence for the political establishment.,287,,
1515,0.97,11412.534,11413.135,It's not just about police.,287,,
1516,0.97,11413.135,11424.179,"It is about the political establishment that is allowing police to carry out actions that are completely objectionable, so that it forces them to take the ban on the Militarized crowd control weapons seriously.",287,,
1517,0.97,11424.179,11441.963,"The reason I don't think that what is in the base bill is enough is--and I do think it's a loophole, it is a crucial loophole, is because it makes it far, far more difficult for people to sue, even when the police frequently make this law.",287,,
1518,0.97,11441.963,11461.016,"Essentially, if by not approving this amendment, Council members will be building into the law the exact same lack of police accountability that all Council members claim to be what it's about, the loophole is two fold.",287,,
1519,0.97,11461.016,11465.153,"First, the loophole says that the private right of action only applies when police use, banned weapons during a, quote, nonviolent demonstration.",287,,
1520,0.97,11465.153,11465.453,End quote.,287,,
1521,0.97,11465.453,11486.208,"The problem is that we know, again this is real life, we know that the idea of, the quote Unquote, nonviolent demonstration is conveniently defined, and what's violent and what's not violent is completely defined by the police to be whatever they want it to be.",287,,
1522,0.97,11486.208,11492.647,"During the justice for George Floyd protests, the Seattle police Department declared peaceful protests to be violent and even a riot when they wanted to clear the streets of those peaceful protesters.",287,,
1523,0.97,11492.647,11509.631,"And as I noted in committee last time, I saw that happening while I was at a protest which then resulted in massive Teargas, pepper spray, blast balls.",287,,
1524,0.97,11509.631,11516.104,"Somebody counted the number of grenades that were unleashed the morning after and was 300 million something, insane.",287,,
1525,0.97,11516.104,11524.479,And I can tell you from my own testimony that the protest was completely peaceful.,287,,
1526,0.97,11524.479,11527.649,"So, that's the problem.",287,,
1527,0.97,11527.649,11542.197,"Also note that this loophole prevents enforcement, regardless of whether you are personally involved in any violence . someone in the crowd has a water bottle, the police claimed the protest is violent, start hiring illegal gas balls and you cannot get justice because of these loopholes.",287,,
1528,0.97,11542.197,11547.269,"Council member Sawant, let me just--I think I get your point.",288,,
1529,0.97,11547.269,11563.652,"I think what you're saying is, if we are going to continue to have banned Leslie the weapons that are 100% banned in their application in crowd control situations, what is the punishment?",288,,
1530,0.97,11563.652,11582.604,"What my amendment tried to do is acknowledging that if the base bill, together with the Teargas amendment passes, there will be some allowance of pepper spray and Teargas in narrow circumstances.",288,,
1531,0.97,11582.604,11586.708,So perhaps between now and the next meeting we could create some other alternatives.,288,,
1532,0.97,11586.708,11615.236,"I understand that you want to maintain the full ban of all less lethal weapons, but maybe we could create some language that assumes some outcomes around these amendments, whereas there is still a punishment for use of less lethal weapons that are supposed to be banned in all crowd control situations, and then a punishment for the ones that are not banned, but are misused.",288,,
1533,0.97,11615.236,11619.04,"But, I need to adjourn this meeting.",288,,
1534,0.97,11619.04,11619.741,It is 12:44.,288,,
1535,0.97,11619.741,11622.177,Four of us have another meeting that we have to be at.,288,,
1536,0.97,11622.177,11626.281,"And so, I really appreciate the --",288,,
1537,0.97,11626.281,11627.115,I understand that.,289,,
1538,0.97,11627.115,11628.55,I just want to finish what I was saying.,289,,
1539,0.97,11628.55,11636.625,It may address what you are saying.,289,,
1540,0.97,11636.625,11640.228,"I'm not going to discuss that, but in the interest, I just want to finish that in a minute or two.",289,,
1541,0.97,11640.228,11642.43,"Of course as I said, I'm completely open to discussing strong enforcement.",289,,
1542,0.97,11642.43,11644.332,I have no problem doing that and I look forward to that.,289,,
1543,0.97,11644.332,11666.287,"Beyond what I just said, those second loopholes say that the private right of action does not apply to, quote, a person, who in the judgment of a reasonable person commits a criminal attempt at or immediately prior to the use of less lethal force, and to quote.",289,,
1544,0.97,11666.287,11672.394,"Police brutality is never Okay, but beyond that, it does not even require the person be convicted of crime, just that a reasonable person would think that they did.",289,,
1545,0.97,11672.394,11685.373,"Most recently, we've seen how police regularly charge protesters with, quote Unquote,, no offense to justify brutality.",289,,
1546,0.97,11685.373,11686.107,This happens all of the time.,289,,
1547,0.97,11686.107,11689.711,"People are charged with offenses like parading without a permit, failing to disperse, resisting arrest.",289,,
1548,0.97,11689.711,11690.412,Council member Sawant?,290,,
1549,0.97,11690.412,11691.913,Would you like to stay in the meeting?,290,,
1550,0.97,11691.913,11698.319,The four of us have to leave I will leave the meeting open if you want to continue.,290,,
1551,0.97,11698.319,11699.721,But we have to adjourn.,290,,
1552,0.97,11699.721,11700.889,It is 12:45.,290,,
1553,0.97,11700.889,11703.892,We are all expected in another meeting.,290,,
1554,0.97,11703.892,11721.643,"So with that, unless you wish to stay in the Beaning--meeting with the other Council members, I'm going to adjourn.",290,,
1555,0.97,11721.643,11722.61,Obviously I don't want to.,291,,
1556,0.97,11722.61,11723.244,Go ahead and adjourn.,291,,
1557,0.97,11723.244,11724.245,We will have to discuss this.,291,,
1558,0.97,11724.245,11725.113,"Okay, thank you.",292,,
1559,0.97,11725.113,11725.613,I appreciate it.,292,,
1560,0.97,11725.613,11729.05,"Yes, there is more discussion happening.",292,,
1561,0.97,11729.05,11731.886,And I'm sorry that we weren't able to get further in discussions today.,292,,
1562,0.97,11731.886,11740.895,"With that, it is 12:45 p.m., and the public safety and human service Committee is adjourned.",292,,
1563,0.97,11740.895,11742.097,"Thank you, all.",292,,
