320,0.97,35362.493,35372.837,This is anticipated compliance rates 95% to possibly around 70% and results in fewer green House gas emissions.,30,,
321,0.97,35372.837,35401.899,"Additionally, as a result of suspending enforcement activities, Osc would not be collecting estimated $140,000 in fines from the building tune UPS program which would actually be used--money from penalties would be used to fund Prole Apologetics in affordable housing Proapology in affordable housing.",30,,
322,0.97,35401.899,35418.449,"It includes $50,200 that would fund consultant contracts to support Proment active engagement to promote compliance.",30,,

330,0.97,35486.717,35508.206,Osc estimated that there would be 350 to 400 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent that would still be produced if they don't take the Measres to comply with complying.,31,,
331,0.97,35508.206,35513.778,It's not as much a decrease we'd anticipate if compliance and enforcement were to move forward as planned.,31,,

348,0.97,35631.228,35642.64,That would be something new for 2021 but then with this cut would be shifted to 2022.,33,,

382,0.97,35907.738,35912.91,"As we've seen, Mayor Durkan has got the oversight board as part of the hiring freeze in 2020.",37,,
383,0.97,35912.91,35920.05,The council voted to restore funding in the revised budget passed earlier this summer.,37,,
384,0.97,35920.05,35933.998,The Osc was not authorized by the Mayor to ♪ money until they see Council restored the funding for 2021 which is what this budget amendment would do.,37,,

393,0.97,36010.007,36015.679,"With this proposed hiring, the tool kit will likely not completed until 2022.",40,,
394,0.97,36015.679,36023.22,"So options here would be to add $140,000 of General fund for the climate policy adviser position.",40,,
395,0.97,36023.22,36044.208,This is proposed by Council member Strauss or no action.,40,,

398,0.97,36067.765,36069.566,"Yolanda, let's go to other proposals.",41,,
399,0.97,36069.566,36069.8,Yes.,42,,
400,0.97,36069.8,36075.105,These are the budget actions proposed by Council members as of the deadline last week.,42,,
401,0.97,36075.105,36097.227,"The first is a carbon exercise tax proposed by Council member Lewis, the statement of legislative intent would request that Osc, city budget office, Department of finance and administrative services collaborate with office of Council member Lewis to develop legislation to impose a carbon tax on commercial buildings.",42,,
402,0.97,36097.227,36103.434,"Council member, anything to add to that?",43,,
403,0.97,36103.434,36107.905,"Yes, thank you.",43,,
404,0.97,36107.905,36109.873,Thank you Yolanda for Queuing that up.,43,,
405,0.97,36109.873,36126.723,"Throughout a lot of this year, I've been having conversations with the city attorney's office and some other folks who have dealt are policy to see how something like this might be structured.",43,,
406,0.97,36126.723,36136.2,I'm confident an approach could be Crafted and developed that would withstand a legal challenge.,43,,
407,0.97,36136.2,36139.369,I'm happy to put this idea forward.,43,,
408,0.97,36139.369,36147.344,It's essentially the same concept as the gun and ammo tax and soda is tax.,43,,
409,0.97,36147.344,36158.422,It's say tax for emitting carbon in the city of Seattle.,43,,
410,0.97,36158.422,36180.41,"As we know from various items we discussed, buildings are a big portion of our emissions about a third of our emissions come from buildings which can be Inefficiently heat order over rely on buildings.",43,,
411,0.97,36180.41,36191.088,"In that category of buildings, commercial buildings make up half the total emissions eclipsing the emissions of multi family buildings.",43,,
412,0.97,36191.088,36209.039,"As excise action at Thats are typically on businesses, that's the reason at least in this initial Proffering of this, I limited to commercial buildings since that fits more within the confines of our excise taxing authority.",43,,
413,0.97,36209.039,36216.58,"There's the old saying we're frequently reminded of by a lot of folks, particularly in the business community.",43,,
414,0.97,36216.58,36220.017,"If you want to see less of something, tax it.",43,,
415,0.97,36220.017,36222.886,We want to see less emissions.,43,,
416,0.97,36222.886,36234.731,"We know there are strategies to reduce the amount of buildings to make it more energy different while a tax is not a regulation, it's designed to raise revenue.",43,,
417,0.97,36234.731,36249.913,We know there can be an effect in creating a sense of urgency to adopt some of these mechanisms to reduce your tax liability by Retro fitting your about more Proactively.,43,,
418,0.97,36249.913,36278.208,"This could raise revenue that could have a feedback loop where money raised from a tax like this could go toward underwriting some of those efforts and s subsidizing Evidentlies to increase the rate at which buildings are Retro fitted to reduce emission, have more efficient methods of burning natural gas that produce more electricity for less emissions.",43,,
419,0.97,36278.208,36282.879,These are all things that could be funded with potential revenue.,43,,
420,0.97,36282.879,36287.818,"In terms of building something like this, I think the legal concept is fairly sound.",43,,
421,0.97,36287.818,36327.19,"It's something I would want to rely on the expertise of the community, S of office of Sustainability and terms of setting what rates should be, what the--if there should be staggered progressive steps as far as different rates for emissions of different levels of Co2 with excise tax we can put in Progressive steps.",43,,
422,0.97,36332.329,36339.836,The specifics of the policy will need to be developed intentionally given it is novel.,43,,
423,0.97,36339.836,36343.473,There's no other jurisdiction that has a tax like.,43,,
424,0.97,36343.473,36345.776,I do think the concept is sound.,43,,
425,0.97,36345.776,36351.214,We could fill out the details and collaboration with the community and other city departments.,43,,
426,0.97,36351.214,36355.052,"With that, I'll turn it back over.",43,,
427,0.97,36355.052,36365.595,I'm certainly excited to try to work on this with the rest of the Council and have discussed this idea with the office of Sustainability.,43,,
428,0.97,36365.595,36369.199,I think there could be ways to incorporate it into the work plan.,43,,
429,0.97,36369.199,36371.401,We can discuss that throughout the budget process.,43,,
430,0.97,36371.401,36374.638,Thank you very much Council member Lewis.,44,,

473,0.97,36546.009,36549.246,"Item 6, also item from Council member Sawant.",49,,
474,0.97,36549.246,36550.747,Yolanda want to summarize?,49,,
475,0.97,36550.747,36579.576,This proposal would add funding for emergency grocery voucher program to extend it from June through December of next year . I would note the 19 million general fund proposed was in response to what that would take to extend the program and also require--the sponsor is also indicated they would want vouchers to be accepted in Asian grocery stores.,49,,
476,0.97,36579.576,36586.483,"Council member Sawant, anything else to add to that?",50,,
477,0.97,36586.483,36595.125,"Yes, we discussed the Departmentful presentation office of Sustainability and environment has done important work this year running the voucher program.",50,,
478,0.97,36595.125,36600.63,This provides Safeway voucher cards as part of Covid relief.,50,,
479,0.97,36600.63,36606.036,Thousands have depended on emergency grocery vouchers to keep their families Fed through the year.,50,,
480,0.97,36606.036,36619.749,We discussed it's unfortunate these can be used at Safeway and not Cheryl grocery store options decision based on logistical expediency and not what makes sense for the community.,50,,
481,0.97,36619.749,36622.986,Having at all stores is most important thing.,50,,
482,0.97,36622.986,36643.239,"However, in my office's discussion is with Vietnamese senior Association and Acrs, the umbrella organization they are a part of, it is clear the fact the vouchers can only be used at Safeway is a real barrier to the seniors that the Acrs works with.",50,,
483,0.97,36643.239,36656.386,This is really essential this voucher program be expand sod they can be Redeeme in the Asian grocery Smores the International district and down Rainier Avenue in addition to other stores.,50,,
484,0.97,36656.386,36665.762,Outrageously the voucher program that so many people depend on is currently budgeted to expire in April.,50,,
485,0.97,36665.762,36670.767,It seems unlikely the Covid emergency will be over by then and.,50,,
486,0.97,36670.767,36684.914,"So this budget amendment does two things, funds the action tending of the voucher program through the end of 2021 and States the intention of the voucher program be expanded to be redeemable at Seattle's Asian grocery stores.",50,,
487,0.97,36684.914,36695.592,There's a separate budget legislation that asked the executive to expand to smaller grocers particularly grocers that accept fresh bucks in my office.,50,,
488,0.97,36695.592,36720.35,We'll prepare a related amend to add to Asian grocery stores not part of the fresh bucks program.,50,,
489,0.97,36720.583,36723.92,"Yes, absolutely.",50,,
490,0.97,36723.92,36724.754,I didn't mention.,50,,
491,0.97,36724.754,36735.298,You had seven seconds left.,51,,
492,0.97,36735.432,36737.067,"Yes, absolutely.",52,,
493,0.97,36737.067,36739.202,Thanks for highlight that.,52,,
494,0.97,36739.202,36739.736,We'll do that.,52,,
495,0.97,36739.736,36742.772,"Council member, go ahead.",53,,
496,0.97,36742.772,36758.521,"I want to flag that during our discussions around the emergency grocery vouchers, we did at signal our intent that the program be expanded to ethnic grocery stores.",54,,
497,0.97,36758.521,36764.094,We might want to look at--wholeheartedly support Council member Sawant's proposal.,54,,
498,0.97,36764.094,36778.908,We may want to look to see whether or not we have other ways to underscore our intent because we have expressed this policy preference in the past and the expansion has not happened.,54,,
499,0.97,36778.908,36792.922,So I just think that maybe we should see if there are other tools that we can use to prompt the expansion.,54,,
500,0.97,36792.922,36793.323,Great.,54,,
501,0.97,36793.323,36793.89,Thank you for noting that.,54,,
502,0.97,36793.89,36802.932,"Not seeing another move Yolanda, number 7. next slide, please.",54,,
503,0.97,36802.932,36821.518,The final budget proposal would be a proposed statement of legislative intent that would request Osc develop a plan to transfer staff and decision making authority over tree removal and manage to the Osc.,55,,
504,0.97,36821.518,36829.993,This is sponsor by Council member Pedersen.,55,,
505,0.97,36829.993,36840.436,Thanks for summarizing.,56,,
506,0.97,36853.683,36861.257,"Is shade for cooling during a warmer month, proven health benefits the bigger the tree the better.",56,,
507,0.97,36861.257,36872.936,"As long as we're taking an overdue serious look at racial injustice issues, we know some communities of color have fewer large trees and having them removed more often.",56,,
508,0.97,36872.936,36885.915,As far back as 2009 our city auditor determined that fractional Xized management of trees and urban Forpest are you issues was a major problem for city of Seattle and recommended consolidation.,56,,
509,0.97,36885.915,36893.69,The city for 11 years continued to try to make a multi approach to tree management work.,56,,
510,0.97,36893.69,36900.396,"During that time, we're seeing a declining tree Canmy, loss of numerous large Trues.",56,,
511,0.97,36900.396,36901.598,It doesn't seem to be work.,56,,
512,0.97,36901.598,36908.037,This slide just asks the executive to produce a plan which we don't have to act on.,56,,
513,0.97,36908.037,36924.454,At least we'll have a plan for Council consideration to rationalize and consolidate management authority over Seattle's frees with a preference for an agency Preferenced on the environment.,56,,
514,0.97,36924.454,36928.324,That is office of Sustainability and environment.,56,,
515,0.97,36928.324,36928.625,Thank you.,56,,

520,0.97,36944.874,36955.818,"It building off the recommendations and from 11 years ago, correct?",56,,
521,0.97,36955.818,36959.889,It can be depending on recommendations.,56,,
522,0.97,36959.889,36967.797,We're not seeing great results with the current decentralized system.,56,,
523,0.97,36967.797,36968.064,Okay.,57,,
524,0.97,36968.064,36968.298,Great.,57,,

532,0.97,36992.655,36997.694,We're awaiting the director's rule on tree protection to extend a lot of protections.,57,,
533,0.97,36997.694,37005.168,"In fact, if the director's rule were in place today, there would be a tree in my neighborhood that would be protected.",57,,
534,0.97,37005.168,37007.97,Happy to work with you.,57,,
535,0.97,37007.97,37008.771,I have a couple concerns.,57,,

548,0.97,37058.187,37059.889,Good morning central staff.,59,,
549,0.97,37059.889,37063.025,I'm going to talk about the Department of neighborhoods.,59,,
550,0.97,37063.025,37067.563,We should have a presentation up in just a second.,59,,
551,0.97,37067.563,37067.897,Wonderful.,60,,
552,0.97,37067.897,37068.131,Thanks.,60,,
553,0.97,37068.131,37073.469,Let me double college I think we'll need to read item 2 into the record.,60,,

560,0.97,37098.161,37110.773,"The Department of neighborhoods oversees outreach and engagement, supports community building and has community grant programs.",63,,
561,0.97,37110.773,37116.579,Can we go to the next slide please?,63,,
562,0.97,37116.579,37126.689,The proposed 2021 budget is cut by 10% compared to the 2020 adopted budget.,63,,
563,0.97,37126.689,37142.004,The shifts you're seeking are generally driven by shifts away from the community building to the other two budget summary levels.,63,,
564,0.97,37142.004,37172.969,"So for example, the healthy food Fund, a new community grant program funded with $1.5 million with sweet and beverage tax proceeds would be moving from the community building BS ISL to the community grants BSL which represents a large shift and off SETS $830,000 reduction in the neighborhood matching fund between 2020 and 2021.",63,,
565,0.97,37172.969,37174.871,There are a number of small changes.,63,,
566,0.97,37174.871,37179.509,I wasn't going to go into them.,63,,
567,0.97,37179.509,37183.412,I'm happy to answer questions.,63,,
568,0.97,37183.412,37186.015,Any Council members have some.,63,,
569,0.97,37186.015,37187.45,Not seeing questions.,64,,
570,0.97,37187.45,37192.588,"I'm wondering from the macro perspective, I didn't have the chance to ask this earlier.",64,,
571,0.97,37192.588,37208.571,"If you know offhand, could you give us the general sense on how each of the departments on the average amount of reductions to departments overall, over 10s for seems on the higher end.",64,,
572,0.97,37208.571,37217.647,"Can you remind us how this compares to other departments and Lish, if you have answers too, that's great.",64,,
573,0.97,37217.647,37218.347,I don't have it overall.,65,,
574,0.97,37218.347,37224.82,"For each of the departments I've been working on, they were given a today 10% reduction target.",65,,
575,0.97,37224.82,37235.831,"If they were able to provide that, the executive did include those in their budget.",65,,
576,0.97,37235.831,37249.946,"Mosqueda, I don't have that in front of but can work on getting it and circle back at the end of the session is this morning or afternoon for the miscellaneous I.D.",66,,
577,0.97,37249.946,37250.179,Paper.,66,,
578,0.97,37250.179,37252.782,That which you say the percent change in each Department.,66,,
579,0.97,37252.782,37253.649,I can get that number for you.,66,,
580,0.97,37253.649,37257.987,It will take me more than a minute.,66,,
581,0.97,37257.987,37258.354,No worries.,67,,
582,0.97,37258.354,37260.957,Miscellaneous section sounds great.,67,,
583,0.97,37260.957,37271.534,"If folks were following along and saw the 16.9% increase, they might wonder how each of the departments compare.",67,,
584,0.97,37271.534,37291.22,Thank you Lish for the reminder to folks the directive to each Department was to hit around 10% or higher reduction and looking forward to that information later this afternoon as well Alli.,67,,
585,0.97,37291.22,37291.52,Thanks.,67,,
586,0.97,37291.52,37291.821,Okay Lish.,67,,
587,0.97,37291.821,37292.121,Sorry.,67,,
588,0.97,37292.121,37292.455,Let's go a.,67,,
589,0.97,37292.455,37301.797,I have identified three issues and there are three Cuncil member proposals.,68,,
590,0.97,37301.797,37304.5,Let's move to the next slide.,68,,
591,0.97,37304.5,37315.244,"So, in the 2019-20 budget, the budget included a possession to support outreach and engagement related to the 2020 census.",69,,
592,0.97,37315.244,37324.286,That position is due to sunset at end of this year.,69,,
593,0.97,37324.286,37332.361,The executive budget proposal includes making that position permanent.,69,,
594,0.97,37332.361,37351.147,It's role will shift from supporting participate in the Census to work with community based organization and members of the public on understanding the Census as it's published this coming spring.,69,,
595,0.97,37351.147,37376.272,That work is closely related to work that the Demographer does and reporting on census results and helping to interpret them for both city government and the public.,69,,
596,0.97,37385.815,37386.515,I've prepared three options.,69,,
597,0.97,37386.515,37390.519,One is to not fund this position to sunset at the end of the year.,69,,
598,0.97,37390.519,37400.529,The second is move the position to Opcd to work with the Demographer and third is take no action.,69,,
599,0.97,37400.529,37402.364,Thank you Lish.,70,,
600,0.97,37402.364,37403.899,Other questions on this item?,70,,
601,0.97,37403.899,37405.234,"Okay, I'm not seeing any.",70,,
602,0.97,37405.234,37417.78,Thank you for identifying the overlap this potentially has with the Demographer.,70,,
603,0.97,37417.78,37420.116,Appreciate that analysis.,70,,
604,0.97,37420.116,37420.649,Next slide please.,71,,
605,0.97,37420.649,37431.627,The Mayor's proposed budget both third quarter supplemental and 2021 budget includes funding to lease space for a community based organization.,72,,
606,0.97,37431.627,37458.654,"The community based organization would respond to the December proportionate impacts of 2019 on black Lgbtqia not Binary youth and other adults, people of color, Lgbtqia and Nonbinary young adults.",72,,
607,0.97,37458.654,37464.427,This is a different approach to funding services we normally see.,72,,
608,0.97,37464.427,37479.108,The city normally puts out a request for proposals and funds the best proposal and then the community based organization is providing services based on that Rfp response.,72,,
609,0.97,37479.108,37484.079,Determines how to best fund the as much ass so they're providing.,72,,
610,0.97,37484.079,37500.463,This would instead have the city act as an intermediary and lease space for the organization.,72,,
611,0.97,37500.463,37514.543,One is human services Department or public health Department to contact services or to allow for the lease to go forward and just to note the Council probably will have to approve that lease.,72,,
612,0.97,37514.543,37522.818,So it's a two to three month process before any lease space could be occupied.,72,,
613,0.97,37522.818,37526.422,Council member Herbold.,73,,
614,0.97,37526.422,37526.789,Go ahead.,73,,
615,0.97,37526.789,37528.924,A quick question about.,74,,
616,0.97,37528.924,37538.234,"One, do we know the rational or logic behind this different model that the executive proposes to use?",74,,
617,0.97,37538.234,37546.342,Does this differing model cost more or less than what we would normally do?,74,,
618,0.97,37546.342,37552.181,I do not know the answer to the second question.,74,,
619,0.97,37552.181,37574.37,"The amount of money provided which is $120,000 in the supplemental and 160,000 in 2021 is based on how much FAS assumes that 5000 square feet of office space would cost on Capitol Hill which is the neighborhood they're targeting for these funds.",74,,
620,0.97,37574.37,37596.392,My understanding is that this approach came out of a discussion with the organization that identified the need and how best to support this outreach and services.,74,,
621,0.97,37596.392,37596.859,Thank you.,74,,
622,0.97,37596.859,37607.503,Let's go back to the old proposal folks have been advocating for for a long time in the Lgbtq community center?,74,,
623,0.97,37607.503,37609.338,It's distinct from that.,74,,
624,0.97,37609.338,37611.507,"It is, okay.",75,,
625,0.97,37611.507,37612.341,Thank you.,75,,
626,0.97,37612.341,37615.844,Thanks for the question community member Herbold.,76,,
627,0.97,37615.844,37622.184,I have a question around process.,76,,
628,0.97,37622.184,37624.353,We've heard for a while the desire.,76,,
629,0.97,37624.353,37625.854,Space will be made available.,76,,
630,0.97,37625.854,37634.83,"Specific to this building, the latest thing I had heard was that there was offers of space to community partners that had been declined.",76,,
631,0.97,37634.83,37642.371,Do you know anything else about offers already going out the door to community organizations?,76,,
632,0.97,37642.371,37643.205,"No, I do not.",76,,
633,0.97,37643.205,37652.348,My understanding as of last week was space had not been identified yet.,76,,
634,0.97,37652.348,37653.215,Okay.,77,,
635,0.97,37653.215,37653.782,Appreciate it.,78,,
636,0.97,37653.782,37655.651,I'll look into that forward.,78,,
637,0.97,37655.651,37660.656,"Not hearing additional questions, let's move on.",78,,
638,0.97,37660.656,37661.59,All right.,79,,
639,0.97,37661.59,37665.761,The third item relates to the discussion OFC.,79,,
640,0.97,37665.761,37689.018,"In 2020, in the 2020 adopted budget, there was $2.5 million from the sweet and beverage tax from the Department of neighborhoods that was to fund a new healthy food fund grant program to support community based organizations.",80,,
641,0.97,37689.018,37700.696,They have ideas to create or bring food to Underserved communities.,80,,
642,0.97,37700.696,37709.004,That funding was cut during summer processes and was redirected to the grocery voucher program.,80,,
643,0.97,37709.004,37737.8,It's added back to the DOM budget in 2021 at $1.5 million and question for Council members is should the grocery voucher program be extended probably by a month or so by keeping these funds for grocery vouchers rather than the healthy food Fund.,80,,
644,0.97,37737.8,37739.034,Any questions folks?,81,,
645,0.97,37739.034,37739.301,Okay.,81,,
646,0.97,37739.301,37740.903,Thanks Lish for identifying that.,81,,
647,0.97,37740.903,37743.939,I'm not seeing additional comment or questions on that.,81,,
648,0.97,37743.939,37744.44,All right.,82,,
649,0.97,37744.44,37752.047,I'm moving on to next slide with Council member proposals.,82,,

652,0.97,37760.422,37765.861,It was funded in the 2020 budget.,82,,
653,0.97,37765.861,37774.369,This would extend the funds for 2021 and Council member Herbold is the proposal proponent.,82,,
654,0.97,37774.369,37774.97,Thank you Lish.,83,,
655,0.97,37774.97,37776.038,Council member Herbold.,83,,
656,0.97,37776.038,37783.445,Do you have additional comments on this item for the South Park public safety coordinator?,83,,

658,0.97,37783.645,37784.079,Thank you so much.,83,,

664,0.97,37812.741,37824.086,I want to give a shout out to the organizations who have come out to vocally and strongly support funding this position.,83,,

670,0.97,37860.756,37866.094,"It's $75,000 for 2021 to continue the work of the coordinator.",84,,
671,0.97,37866.094,37870.566,So this was 2020 funding that is not slated to go forward after this year.,84,,
672,0.97,37870.566,37875.537,You're looking to extend it.,84,,
673,0.97,37875.537,37876.972,Is that an accurate summary?,84,,
674,0.97,37876.972,37877.239,Correct.,84,,

691,0.97,37963.659,37969.298,It was the same group of activists and organizers who also pushed for the Wells Fargo Diversement.,89,,
692,0.97,37969.298,37984.513,"One of the reasons this is a powerful event on this day every year, it's organized by dedicated and generally grass roots organizations and grass roots activists, it has been quite essential.",89,,
693,0.97,37984.513,37994.556,"In this year's budget, the funding has been moved from the office of civil rights where it has always been in the past to the Department of neighborhoods.",89,,
694,0.97,37994.556,38012.274,"Many of the organizers dedicated to supporting the celebrations every year have reached tout my office worried the fiscal change might signal to the Mayor that the Mayor intends to take organizations, organizing out of community hands.",89,,
695,0.97,38012.274,38026.421,"To be clear, activist have heard from the Department of neighborhoods that they do not intend to make change and intend to contract the funding.",89,,
696,0.97,38026.421,38029.958,"However, the community organizers are still concerned and want more assurances.",89,,

704,0.97,38065.227,38068.53,Just want to double check here.,90,,

712,0.97,38081.743,38097.059,The last item for Department and neighborhoods and proposal for Council member Morales to fund improvements to create detective cookie chess park in Rainier Beach.,92,,
713,0.97,38097.059,38117.112,"This would add $200,000 to don to contract community based organizations to occupy underutilized right of way where Rainier Avenue South heads down into Renton.",92,,

718,0.97,38143.371,38149.044,There's now a small park as Lish said on Sdot land.,94,,
719,0.97,38149.044,38153.248,There's a plan to create an outdoor space.,94,,
720,0.97,38153.248,38161.756,There's already public park there is if you've been to the neighborhood across the street from King Doughnuts.,94,,
721,0.97,38161.756,38164.493,You've seen a giant King and queen chess piece.,94,,
722,0.97,38164.493,38168.196,This fund as good to help complete the park.,94,,
723,0.97,38168.196,38183.311,The idea have outdoor chess play space and put a giant chess board on the ground so they can mark the space and have giant chess tournaments.,94,,
724,0.97,38183.311,38202.163,"So the proposal here would add $200,000 to don to complete that part of the park design and finish and create a space for young people to have an opportunity to play chess of course.",94,,
725,0.97,38202.163,38206.568,Thank you Council member Morales.,95,,
726,0.97,38206.568,38209.471,Are there any questions on this item?,95,,
727,0.97,38209.471,38210.005,Okay.,95,,
728,0.97,38210.005,38211.673,I am seeing none.,95,,
729,0.97,38211.673,38213.008,Thank you so much.,95,,
730,0.97,38213.008,38216.811,"Lish, I think that concludes this presentation if that's correct.",95,,
731,0.97,38216.811,38217.178,Correct.,96,,
732,0.97,38217.178,38217.479,Thank you.,96,,
733,0.97,38217.479,38241.57,"Thank you very much for your time today and for the memo and presentation appreciate your work I know we'll see you again soon Madame clerk, will you read into the item time Seattle public library for briefing and discussion.",97,,

735,0.97,38241.903,38242.337,Thank you so much.,98,,
736,0.97,38242.337,38252.914,"On item 3, we have the chance to be joined by Asha and Alli again with us.",98,,
737,0.97,38252.914,38254.149,Great to see you.,98,,
738,0.97,38254.149,38257.185,Please do state your full name for the record.,98,,
739,0.97,38257.185,38262.123,We'll turn over to you.,98,,
740,0.97,38262.123,38264.292,Thanks budget chair is.,99,,
741,0.97,38264.292,38264.693,Asha.,99,,
742,0.97,38264.693,38265.66,I'll be talking about the public library.,99,,
743,0.97,38265.66,38285.046,"As you know, the Ply Bay area consists of the central library downtown as well as 26 branches and a mobile services decision it's a little different from many departments in that it is governed by a five member board of trustee who have exclusive control over operations.",99,,
744,0.97,38285.046,38297.592,"They usually adopted annual operations plan after the Council ADOPTS it's budget each year .% recently, in 2019, the council as well as voters passed a $2,019,000,000 levy.",99,,
745,0.97,38297.592,38306.001,This extended the services that were provided in the 2012 levy and Proprosed to expand some of those services.,99,,
746,0.97,38306.001,38313.108,"If we can move to the next slide, please.",99,,
747,0.97,38313.108,38328.723,What you'll see in this summary is that the library has an operating and capital budget.,99,,
748,0.97,38328.723,38329.924,The proposed budget is $78 million.,99,,
749,0.97,38329.924,38332.06,We can move to the next slide.,99,,
750,0.97,38332.06,38339.701,You'll see that the total budget for the library is about $87 million.,99,,
751,0.97,38339.701,38352.881,That is a 1% increase but most of that increase comes from baseline and technical changes rather than increases in the operational budget which I'll get into a little later.,99,,
752,0.97,38352.881,38360.355,"On the revenue side, the library is primarily supported by General Fund and levy funds.",99,,
753,0.97,38360.355,38370.732,The library fund is primarily consistent with General funds would support the budget by $55 million.,99,,
754,0.97,38370.732,38377.505,The 2019 levy fund would support the budget by $31 million.,99,,
755,0.97,38377.505,38382.377,"So that's the total we'll get to, about $87 million.",99,,
756,0.97,38382.377,38393.021,Now what the 2021 proposed budget does is proposes to cut $5.8 million of General Fund from the operations budget.,99,,
757,0.97,38393.021,38398.526,What that would do is its divide into three separate buckets.,99,,
758,0.97,38398.526,38409.537,That 5 million is guide a cut of $3.1 million for operating hours and associated personnel.,99,,
759,0.97,38409.537,38418.646,$1.4 million for physical and Digital collection as well as circulation staff associated with the physical collection.,99,,
760,0.97,38418.646,38428.923,"$1.36 million in other experiences such as event staffing, technology, training budget to total $5.8 million.",99,,
761,0.97,38428.923,38435.697,"It would also reduce spending real estate excise tax that supports the capital budget by $360,000.",99,,
762,0.97,38435.697,38441.136,"As I mentioned, the remainder changes are primarily technical and baseline changes.",99,,
763,0.97,38441.136,38452.514,What this would do is reduce the percentage of General funds support that currently makes up budget as of 2020 adopted budget.,99,,
764,0.97,38452.514,38460.188,General fund supported 68% of the library's budget and levy supported 30% of the library's budget.,99,,
765,0.97,38460.188,38469.664,The change in general funds would mean that the general fund would now support the library by 63% rather than 68%.,99,,
766,0.97,38469.664,38474.569,The levy would support operation by 36% instead of 30%.,99,,
767,0.97,38474.569,38481.109,If we could go to--there are no questions on this piece.,99,,
768,0.97,38481.109,38482.01,I can move into issue identification.,99,,
769,0.97,38482.01,38482.21,Okay.,99,,
770,0.97,38482.21,38485.947,"If we can move to the next slide, please.",99,,
771,0.97,38485.947,38496.124,So the first issue I want to talk about is cut and operating hours that comes from the $3.1 million of General fund reduction.,99,,
772,0.97,38496.124,38501.93,"As of right now, the library estimates it will reopen in July 2021.",99,,
773,0.97,38501.93,38509.437,Obviously that's dependent on public health guidelines and how the Covid-19 pandemic develops that.,99,,
774,0.97,38509.437,38510.271,The current estimate.,99,,
775,0.97,38510.271,38521.616,"With the $3.1 million general fund reduction, without any levy off set, it would result in the library opening and all branches opening at reduced hours.",99,,
776,0.97,38521.616,38528.256,Hours fewer than what was open in 2020 before the pandemic hit.,99,,
777,0.97,38528.256,38535.063,The library board voted to use the 1.6 million to mitigate impacts.,99,,
778,0.97,38535.063,38543.171,"For the most part, we restore hours what they were at beginning of this year before libraries closed in March.",99,,
779,0.97,38543.171,38549.244,"For context N 2019, libraries were open weekly for 1377 hours.",100,,
780,0.97,38549.244,38558.052,"At beginning of 2020, they were open for 1403 hours.",100,,
781,0.97,38558.052,38565.994,Attachment a lays out what weekly hours have been in 2006 through the 2021 proposed budget.,100,,
782,0.97,38565.994,38570.965,"You can see when hours increase, what proposed budget looks like.",100,,
783,0.97,38570.965,38590.018,Weekly hours is a bit--it's hard to context con Tex context.,100,,
784,0.97,38590.018,38603.765,The deal was to get pushed to January 2021.,101,,
785,0.97,38603.765,38618.713,"In the 20-21 proposed budget by using this 3.6 million to off set the general fund cut, that hours expansion gets pushed to 2022.",101,,
786,0.97,38618.713,38630.058,"In addition, the $1.36 million comes from a bucket of $1.6 million intended for expanded hours and also programming for youth and children.",101,,
787,0.97,38630.058,38641.402,"If you'll remember during the 2019 levy discussion, not only for expanded hours but plan and learn programming as well as community resource specialists that would help youth at risk.",101,,
788,0.97,38641.402,38653.281,So those parts of the programming would now be delayed until July 2021 when the library anticipates reopening.,101,,
789,0.97,38653.281,38664.192,"The difference between the 1.36 million and $1.6 million, the funding that's left over there supporting a position hired this year that is intended to support the Seattle public schools K-5 programming.",101,,
790,0.97,38664.192,38670.498,There would be funding left to support that position in 2021.,101,,
791,0.97,38670.498,38676.504,"Based on all of that, there are a couple option laid out for you here.",101,,
792,0.97,38676.504,38682.677,"Sorry, before I get to options, impacts that hours cuts.",101,,
793,0.97,38682.677,38694.455,"Even if there were no cuts at all or all general fund was restored, as I mentioned earlier, so much of what the library can do depends on public health guidelines and depends on what happens with Covid-19.",101,,
794,0.97,38694.455,38701.095,So that will continue to inform what the Empaths rough in terms of service.,101,,
795,0.97,38701.095,38719.647,"In general, during recessions, people use the library more than they did before and increased hours was high priority for residents that participated in surveys that took place before the levy was voted on.",101,,
796,0.97,38719.647,38726.821,"It's so wide from homework help to after school programming, youth and teen outreach, small business support.",101,,
797,0.97,38726.821,38729.09,Those are just a couple examples.,101,,
798,0.97,38729.09,38748.109,"Those are the types of programming that would go, would return depending on public health guidelines but could be limited depending on obviously after school programming requires the library to be open after school up until 6:00 P.M.",101,,
799,0.97,38748.109,38748.443,Or 8:00 P.M.,101,,
800,0.97,38748.443,38753.014,"Without the levy off set, that would be a problem.",101,,
801,0.97,38753.014,38761.189,"In addition, the library provides access to populations historically Underserved, those impacted by the Digital divide.",101,,
802,0.97,38761.189,38765.993,There are many people that can't access Internet or Wi-Fi or have commuters at home.,101,,
803,0.97,38765.993,38772.2,They're able to access those thing at the library itself.,101,,
804,0.97,38772.2,38788.549,"As well as people that can't access E-Books through the Digital collection and would prefer to read in library location or physical college all that so air, there's aid variety of impacts cutting hours with the library reopening in July.",101,,
805,0.97,38788.549,38790.785,There are a couple options for you all.,101,,
806,0.97,38790.785,38794.021,This is not an exclusive list of options by any stretch.,101,,
807,0.97,38794.021,38803.865,The first option would be to add back $3.1 million of General fund into the budget O restore the Proposedcut.,101,,
808,0.97,38803.865,38813.975,That would be the need to use any levy funds to get operating hours back to their 2020 Prepandemic levels.,101,,
809,0.97,38813.975,38816.11,Option B would add lesser amount under $3.1 million.,101,,
810,0.97,38816.11,38823.951,The library could decide how that impacted using the 1.36 million in levy funds.,101,,
811,0.97,38823.951,38843.171,Option C would be to take no action and adopt the proposed budget as is.,101,,
812,0.97,38843.171,38845.673,"Council member Herbold, you can go first.",101,,
813,0.97,38845.673,38855.983,A question raised by library foundation members.,102,,
814,0.97,38855.983,38877.872,"The proposal to include funds to open in July, does that include funding for funding precautions, Ppe for staff, hand sanitation stations, et cetera or does it assume that these precautions could not be need when libraries reopen?",102,,
815,0.97,38877.872,38879.173,I'm not sure about that.,102,,
816,0.97,38879.173,38881.909,I'll have to get back to you.,102,,
817,0.97,38881.909,38889.817,I'm not sure whether that's already baked into reopening in July 2021.,102,,
818,0.97,38889.817,38892.486,I'll check in.,102,,
819,0.97,38892.486,38894.989,Thank you very much.,103,,
820,0.97,38894.989,38895.857,Great question.,104,,
821,0.97,38895.857,38897.458,Council member Pedersen.,104,,
822,0.97,38897.458,38897.892,Please go ahead.,104,,
823,0.97,38897.892,38901.495,Thank you chairman.,105,,
824,0.97,38901.495,38902.663,Thank you Asha for this presentation.,105,,
825,0.97,38902.663,38922.75,Just wanted to--if you could reiterate for me the reconcile the fact that the total spending seems to be net neutral when you combine operating and the levy amount.,105,,
826,0.97,38922.75,38923.951,So is it really a cut?,105,,
827,0.97,38923.951,38933.261,I'm just trying to understand what the net result is.,105,,
828,0.97,38933.261,39094.522,"So, basically what the operating I guess my concern was that is not exactly apples to apples given the pandemic is air born.",106,,
829,0.97,39094.522,39107.501,"So, I guess part of my question is, is there anything that we are able to do with existing dollars that are not levy dollars to dial up Digital access and opportunities.",106,,
830,0.97,39107.501,39123.751,"Also also to make sure that for example, the resource specialist for youth Ile fought really hard for a few years ago that services like that.",106,,
831,0.97,39123.751,39135.296,There's certainly discussions that can be had with the library and board about how to move funds around to be able to provide those sorts of resources.,106,,
832,0.97,39135.296,39142.069,We'll get into this in the next issue in materials of cut to the physical and Digital collection.,106,,
833,0.97,39142.069,39157.718,"I think the idea is that in using those funds, using those funds Prioritizes open hours and would push the programming proposed to later.",106,,
834,0.97,39157.718,39171.932,"If the priority is to provide Digital services in lieu of open hours, that say decision to use those funds for those service rather than for the physical reopening.",106,,
835,0.97,39171.932,39189.55,It's a bit of a priority in terms of whether the priority is physical reopening at the same level of hours or wanted the funds to go towards shifting towards the Digital services piece.,106,,
836,0.97,39189.55,39192.286,"Madame chair, if I may?",107,,
837,0.97,39192.286,39193.087,Please Council member.,107,,
838,0.97,39193.087,39193.387,Thank you.,107,,
839,0.97,39193.387,39221.382,Is we're having this dilemma with libraries similar to what we had in parks where a libraries we're deploying employees in some elderly who could be sensitive to Covid.,108,,
840,0.97,39221.382,39223.651,Homeless people have somewhere to go.,108,,
841,0.97,39223.651,39233.194,We're in this difficult spot where what I learned that the Digital print collections are important.,108,,
842,0.97,39233.194,39238.832,Obviously they don't want any cuts at detriment of either.,108,,
843,0.97,39238.832,39246.607,We're looking at if we up the Digital access then we're looking at take ago way from the physical aspect.,108,,
844,0.97,39246.607,39250.444,"So while the Digital is very expensive, the demand is there.",108,,
845,0.97,39250.444,39251.111,People are at home.,108,,
846,0.97,39251.111,39264.024,"On the other hand, we have older patrons who love the print collection.",108,,
847,0.97,39264.024,39277.871,We're in a difficult spot as we all are with the deficit here about making tough choices.,108,,
848,0.97,39277.871,39279.006,I don't know if that helps.,108,,
849,0.97,39279.006,39280.941,I have been in contact with Mr.,108,,
850,0.97,39280.941,39296.69,Turner and the board and shifting when we use levy dollars to back fill other service at the library.,108,,
851,0.97,39296.69,39298.525,Thank you very much.,108,,
852,0.97,39298.525,39299.994,"Council member Morales, did you have something?",108,,
853,0.97,39299.994,39306.266,This is the--this is where we are.,108,,
854,0.97,39306.266,39309.57,I really appreciate the dilemma Council member what this illustrates.,108,,
855,0.97,39309.57,39340.834,"As we talk about how to manage knowing that especially in our low income neighborhoods, the libraries are a crucial access point for young people, to get access to technology so they can do their homework for people applying for job, people trying to make APPOINTS with doctors and just being able to go get a physical book.",108,,
856,0.97,39340.834,39348.409,"Technology, access to the Internet is not what it should be in the city.",108,,
857,0.97,39348.409,39354.615,We'll see further down the axes I've proposed.,108,,
858,0.97,39354.615,39360.154,This is the them Ma.,108,,
859,0.97,39360.154,39363.59,"Even in Covid, a lot of dilemma.",108,,
860,0.97,39363.59,39386.013,"A lot of folks are asking why we can't Quarantie books for two weeks if we're worried about spreading something that way, trying to find ways to continue some sort of operations, some sort of access to the collections.",108,,
861,0.97,39386.013,39389.516,We've got a giant hole to fill.,108,,
862,0.97,39389.516,39400.928,"So Yeah, just Noodling on how difficult these conversations are going to be.",108,,
863,0.97,39400.928,39404.198,"If I may respond, Council members, thank you.",108,,
864,0.97,39404.198,39405.999,Obviously I know you understand it.,108,,
865,0.97,39405.999,39406.934,Thank you.,108,,
866,0.97,39406.934,39409.336,I think everything you said is true.,108,,
867,0.97,39409.336,39413.24,We all agree.,108,,
868,0.97,39413.24,39416.877,We have to start with the fact we obviously have a deficit.,108,,
869,0.97,39416.877,39419.88,We do know and I can get that information to you.,108,,
870,0.97,39419.88,39432.726,The library does hand out for free the Wi-Fi hot spots.,108,,
871,0.97,39432.726,39453.18,We are working to do Wi-Fi for all city wide for free.,108,,
872,0.97,39456.35,39464.691,We're trying to choose between Digital Subscriptions cost more than the physical collection of reading materials.,108,,
873,0.97,39464.691,39478.939,There's two different sets of folks that use them.,108,,
874,0.97,39478.939,39485.279,I would love for you to join is us in the conversations thousand do that with all the libraries.,108,,
875,0.97,39485.279,39490.818,Obviously they're in every district that is something we're still struggling with.,108,,
876,0.97,39490.818,39506.033,We have three libraries and one is open now.,108,,
877,0.97,39506.033,39516.41,Everyone has had to take on different rules that don't offend their job descriptions as far as Yuans go.,108,,
878,0.97,39516.41,39520.547,That's where we're at now.,108,,
879,0.97,39520.547,39526.553,I hear you loud and clear.,108,,
880,0.97,39526.553,39529.99,I appreciate the a form you submitted.,108,,
881,0.97,39529.99,39532.793,Thank you all.,108,,
882,0.97,39532.793,39534.862,One last point of clarification on.,108,,
883,0.97,39534.862,39549.076,"On the previous page on slide 2, I'm looking at memo of the slide.",108,,
884,0.97,39549.076,39549.543,The summary document.,108,,
885,0.97,39549.543,39554.348,You mentioned the 2021 proposed budget.,108,,
886,0.97,39554.348,39561.588,You have $1.36 million of that in administrative support maintenance technology related personnel and training.,108,,
887,0.97,39561.588,39570.564,I want to double college is it accurate there are no FTE reductions to Seattle public libraries in the proposed budget?,108,,
888,0.97,39570.564,39574.001,I thought that's what I had heard.,108,,
889,0.97,39574.001,39583.21,Positions themselves are--this is one of the quirks of the library.,109,,
890,0.97,39583.21,39599.826,They usually don't come in because the board is responsible for those.,109,,
891,0.97,39599.826,39603.063,I couldn't tell you what those look like.,109,,
892,0.97,39603.063,39611.838,We don't have is the same level as we do with other departments when it comes to other positions.,109,,
893,0.97,39611.838,39617.244,I'll follow up on my end as well.,110,,
894,0.97,39617.244,39621.582,Any additional question on this item?,110,,
895,0.97,39621.582,39623.984,I'm not seeing additional questions on.,110,,
896,0.97,39623.984,39624.651,Let's move to number 2.,110,,
897,0.97,39624.651,39624.918,Okay.,111,,
898,0.97,39624.918,39625.252,Sounds good.,111,,
899,0.97,39625.252,39634.494,If we could go to the next slide.,111,,
900,0.97,39634.494,39644.171,Thank you.,111,,
901,0.97,39644.171,39646.106,The general fund would be cut.,111,,
902,0.97,39646.106,39652.212,Of that $1.4277000 million supports the Digital collection.,111,,
903,0.97,39652.212,39657.384,"That's access to databases, period Kales, E Poole books, streaming media.",111,,
904,0.97,39657.384,39688.582,"The library proposes $138,000 to left over funding from the 2012 levy to mitigate that impact and restore the funds for streaming media that would leave $130,000 cut to the Digital collection.",111,,
905,0.97,39689.916,39690.684,"Seat collections, prints and Audio.",111,,
906,0.97,39690.684,39710.971,"Lastly it could cut the circumstance is . If you don't have as many fiscal materials, you don't need as many personnel to deal with physical materials.",111,,
907,0.97,39710.971,39734.594,"So in terms of impact, before the pandemic and was discussed when you were discussing the 2019 library levy, the demand for Digital materials as well as the level of expense for E materials is something that the levy address in terms of increasing support to the Digital collection.",111,,
908,0.97,39734.594,39738.165,"Between 2015 and 2019, there was 112% increase in demand.",111,,
909,0.97,39738.165,39748.208,There's also been increase since the libraries have been closed since the Covid-19 pandemic.,111,,
910,0.97,39748.208,39772.532,"These cuts will impact the E materials collection Digital materials collection in that it would increase wait times, decrease the level of availability as well as the range of selection of those materials.",111,,
911,0.97,39772.532,39775.869,It's in some ways increased demand.,111,,
912,0.97,39775.869,39781.508,The rate of use physical materials depends on the type of material.,111,,
913,0.97,39781.508,39792.352,"For example, children's books even though the general fund is decrease in materials, children's books are always in constant demand.",111,,
914,0.97,39792.352,39802.729,"Things, physical materials such as CDs and Dvds have lore rates of demand than physical books for example.",111,,
915,0.97,39802.729,39810.137,This is shifted in terms of people do like physical materials which is why curb side pick up and return has been so helpful.,111,,
916,0.97,39810.137,39816.91,"With the recession, things like when people cancel streaming services for example.",111,,
917,0.97,39816.91,39820.814,They'll turn to the library Dvd collection for that Úresource instead.,111,,
918,0.97,39820.814,39828.955,It's not quite as clear cut as there's a general decline in physical materials.,111,,
919,0.97,39828.955,39830.757,It depends on the material itself.,111,,
920,0.97,39830.757,39844.871,An additional piece of that is many people prefer physical materials and want to come into the library to read a newspaper or would prefer or don't have access to the E materials collection.,111,,
921,0.97,39844.871,39849.309,Share only access to books is physical books.,111,,
922,0.97,39849.309,39857.984,There are impacts from cutting the depth of the breath of the physical collection in terms of access.,111,,
923,0.97,39857.984,39871.364,"The associated cut of personnel with the circumstance is Haitian budget basically reflects as I said earlier, if there are fewer physical materials, there are fewer personnel required to circulate those materials.",111,,
924,0.97,39871.364,39885.345,The only piece that the doesn't account for is the fact that there has an increased need in terms of handling physical materials because of the Covid-19 pandemic.,111,,
925,0.97,39885.345,39890.15,In terms of sanitation and the increased staffing needed to make sure materials are safe.,111,,
926,0.97,39890.15,39893.787,The cut does not account for what that increased need is.,111,,
927,0.97,39893.787,39899.626,We're working with the library to figure out what that increased need Lookslike.,111,,
928,0.97,39899.626,39905.999,"With that, say there are a few options here for Council.",111,,
929,0.97,39905.999,39914.407,"Option a would be to add back in $139,000 to provide cuts to the Digital collection.",111,,
930,0.97,39914.407,39920.647,That is in form a which we'll goat in a moment.,111,,
931,0.97,39920.647,39924.818,Option B would be add $1.1 million.,111,,
932,0.97,39924.818,39939.132,That combines the physical materials as well as the circulation personnel.,111,,
933,0.97,39939.132,39959.819,This would be do allow the library to retain staff to manage the Miss Kal collection under pandemic conditions and then D would be to take no action and adopt the budget as proposed.,111,,
934,0.97,39959.819,39961.755,"Council member Herbold, go ahead.",111,,
935,0.97,39961.755,39969.162,Just a quick question.,112,,
936,0.97,39969.162,39972.732,Are we including the hot spot program?,112,,
937,0.97,39972.732,39974.167,It doesn't have impacts on the Wi-Fi program.,112,,
938,0.97,39974.167,39981.408,I can send you further information on that that the library provided in the Prebudget questions.,112,,
939,0.97,39981.408,39989.449,There doesn't appear to be impact on that program.,112,,
940,0.97,39989.449,39989.983,"Great, thank you.",113,,
941,0.97,39989.983,39998.224,We know the hot spot check out was used 92% by people of color per the foundation and friends of the public library.,113,,
942,0.97,39998.224,40004.064,"We also know that there's very, very long wait lists for hot spots.",113,,
943,0.97,40004.064,40009.102,"I know in past years, the Council has increased funding for more hot spots.",113,,
944,0.97,40009.102,40019.212,Glad to hear there are no impacts in this year's budget.,113,,

949,0.97,40034.06,40046.606,? Let's go into the council member's form a discussions and there may be additional questions you shared.,114,,
950,0.97,40046.606,40052.879,"The first is add funding for a pick up service at all branches, proposed by Council member Lewis.",115,,
951,0.97,40052.879,40070.563,I'll Tush over to him except to say currently the central library and six branches offer loaded curb side pick up service three days a week from 12 to 6 P.M.,115,,
952,0.97,40070.563,40071.798,Thank you for joining us.,115,,
953,0.97,40071.798,40076.803,I know you are in route if you don't have the about to chat now.,115,,
954,0.97,40076.803,40088.248,Happy to get your feedback on this later.,115,,
955,0.97,40088.248,40092.919,I was muted Madame chairman can you chair.,115,,
956,0.97,40092.919,40114.14,I appreciate being able to Queue up this form A. a number of us have libraries in our districts in particular where thought it would be good even if it's even a single day a week or even a Sickle window within a single day in a week.,115,,
957,0.97,40114.14,40118.344,The opportunities to do more localized pick up.,115,,
958,0.97,40118.344,40127.854,The library locations people can walk to that are easily accessed and that's not necessarily case.,115,,
959,0.97,40127.854,40132.859,With all current branches where this surge can be provided.,115,,
960,0.97,40132.859,40139.399,I'm grateful to the library for standing up to current opportunities to engage in the on sight pick up.,115,,
961,0.97,40139.399,40165.525,"Would be interested in exploring with the Department what it may look like to allocate resources to expand the access to that, make sure that--we talk a lot about being in the 15 minute city for example to make sure this service of being aid and Abet to access library elections can be done in a way where people can walk in and easily access the pick up at the local branch.",115,,
962,0.97,40165.525,40168.328,Would be interested in Purr Sueing that.,115,,
963,0.97,40168.328,40169.295,Thank you Council member Lewis.,116,,
964,0.97,40169.295,40174.934,Is it--can you clarify as well when you say exploring that.,116,,
965,0.97,40174.934,40186.746,"Is this intended to be a statement of legislative intent, do today do that analysis or would you like to allocate funding at this juncture?",116,,
966,0.97,40186.746,40197.29,I'd like to seek from the library what they think expanding this kind of service to more locations.,116,,
967,0.97,40197.29,40198.625,It is basically expanding an existing practice.,116,,
968,0.97,40198.625,40203.963,We have on sight pick up at some locations.,116,,
969,0.97,40203.963,40205.064,Central staff previously indicated.,116,,
970,0.97,40205.064,40216.242,"I would think we could get a decent idea from the library on what it would cost, presumably there would be a cost associated with.",116,,
971,0.97,40216.242,40229.322,I think that this could be the time we're allocating the 2021 priorities to expand the service beyond the branches it's currently being done at.,116,,
972,0.97,40229.322,40239.999,"You know, the time that I talked to Marcelless Turner about this, I don't believe there were plans to extend to other branches that time.",116,,
973,0.97,40239.999,40253.846,I would like to process this opportunity to have the library present what that would cost in terms of a budget appropriation to be able to provide it.,116,,
974,0.97,40253.846,40268.628,I think a little more than a slide depending on what we can gather from talking to the library and central staff about staffing levels or whatever would be required for this to happen.,116,,
975,0.97,40268.628,40269.462,Thank you Council member Lewis.,117,,
976,0.97,40269.462,40272.765,"Central staff, did you have anything else to add to that?",117,,
977,0.97,40272.765,40278.137,I just NOTE we are working on that now with CBO and the library.,117,,
978,0.97,40278.137,40280.206,Should have an estimate soon.,117,,
979,0.97,40280.206,40280.773,Thank you Asha.,118,,
980,0.97,40280.773,40284.51,Don't see or hear any other questions on that.,119,,

982,0.97,40291.317,40291.818,Let's go to number 2.,119,,
983,0.97,40291.818,40292.085,Okay.,120,,
984,0.97,40292.085,40299.826,This could as--as I mentioned earlier one of the options in the second issue identification.,120,,
985,0.97,40299.826,40305.365,"This would add $139,000 to support the Digital collection as proposed to Council member Morales.",120,,
986,0.97,40305.365,40310.136,Thank you Council member Morales.,121,,
987,0.97,40310.136,40310.536,Please go ahead.,121,,
988,0.97,40310.536,40310.903,Thank you.,122,,
989,0.97,40310.903,40326.886,I don't have to say a lot about this except that we know there's Indegrees in the utilization.,122,,
990,0.97,40326.886,40342.268,"So the collection provides access to students and families, Digital materials, to those that have is limited access to the physical collection due to Covid-19.",122,,
991,0.97,40342.268,40346.572,We are interested between this and the physical collection which we'll goat in a moment.,122,,
992,0.97,40346.572,40353.146,We're making sure people have access to their libraries.,122,,
993,0.97,40353.146,40356.315,Thank you Council member Morales.,123,,
994,0.97,40356.315,40361.788,Not seeing any hands or questions Thon now.,123,,

996,0.97,40363.322,40364.557,Go ahead Asha.,124,,
997,0.97,40364.557,40366.793,We can move to the next slide.,124,,
998,0.97,40366.793,40375.368,"The third also support sponsor by Morales would be to add $531,000 to support the physical collection.",124,,
999,0.97,40375.368,40385.278,Restore the full amount of the general fund cut that's proposed.,124,,
1000,0.97,40385.278,40386.879,"Council member Morales, please go a.",124,,
1001,0.97,40386.879,40388.081,Thank you.,125,,
1002,0.97,40388.081,40395.321,"We know that as Council member Herbold mentioned, the hot spot program is great.",125,,
1003,0.97,40395.321,40395.922,There's long lists.,125,,
1004,0.97,40395.922,40410.403,"As somebody who regularly gets cut off of our meetings here, you all probably can guess we don't have great Internet connections in the South end.",125,,
1005,0.97,40410.403,40416.743,"So that Digital divide disproportionately impacts black, Brown, senior communities.",125,,
1006,0.97,40416.743,40425.351,So the physical collection really is important to providing access for those that can't get their library access through Digital options.,125,,
1007,0.97,40425.351,40433.96,So we want to make sure especially also for folks with disabilities.,125,,
1008,0.97,40433.96,40438.865,To be able to access the physical collection is important.,125,,
1009,0.97,40438.865,40451.177,The Digital option is an additional barrier for folks that have disabilities.,125,,
1010,0.97,40451.177,40454.714,"Really looking to make sure that, that access to these is restored.",125,,
1011,0.97,40454.714,40457.784,Just a quick follow up question on that.,126,,
1012,0.97,40457.784,40463.756,"Asha, did you have anything else to add?",126,,
1013,0.97,40463.756,40463.956,Okay.,126,,
1014,0.97,40463.956,40468.027,A quick follow up question on that.,126,,
1015,0.97,40468.027,40486.412,"Your intent here to also potentially reduce is the $531,000 account for the fact there's been a reduction in use of CDs and Dvds for example?",126,,
1016,0.97,40486.412,40489.215,No.,126,,
1017,0.97,40489.215,40492.451,I might actually need Asha's help.,126,,
1018,0.97,40492.451,40496.155,I don't think so.,126,,
1019,0.97,40496.155,40497.824,I think it is in general.,126,,
1020,0.97,40497.824,40500.593,The access to all entire physical collection we're talking about.,126,,
1021,0.97,40500.593,40516.709,"I guess the reason I was asking is it seems like option C from above in the memo and in the power point you provided, excuse me, near as much or what is in number three here.",127,,
1022,0.97,40516.709,40518.11,"It's off by $50,000.",127,,
1023,0.97,40518.11,40521.447,Is there similarities there Asha in what you presented?,127,,
1024,0.97,40521.447,40531.657,Is that option C and what is listed as number three?,127,,
1025,0.97,40531.657,40550.209,"Sit 580,000 that pertains to circulation personnel, not the physical college those two things are related.",127,,
1026,0.97,40554.814,40566.592,"So we can talk further about what it looks like to just do the 500, portion of 531,000 that doesn't account for CDs and Dvds.",127,,
1027,0.97,40566.592,40587.413,The other thing I would NOTE is that if there is a desire to increase the physical collection or restore the physical collection it might also necessitate some balance of restoring the personnel that would be required to use the physical collection.,127,,
1028,0.97,40587.413,40590.383,That may be something to discuss further as well.,127,,
1029,0.97,40590.383,40596.555,Thank you for that clarification.,128,,
1030,0.97,40596.555,40600.126,Not seeing additional questions.,128,,
1031,0.97,40600.126,40607.867,Let's move onto the last form A. so this proposal would add $5.8 million to maintain library operations.,128,,
1032,0.97,40607.867,40614.974,"It would restore the full amount of the general fund K. as you mentioned, it's proposed by Council member Sawant.",128,,
1033,0.97,40614.974,40618.978,Thank you Council member Sawant.,129,,
1034,0.97,40618.978,40631.49,Please take it away this is the first of several my office submitted as formulas to stop the Mayor's budget cuts.,129,,
1035,0.97,40631.49,40637.93,"In general, unless we increase revenues, we'll see libraries facing massive budget cuts.",129,,
1036,0.97,40637.93,40642.935,The Council will end up passing a budget.,129,,
1037,0.97,40642.935,40647.54,"Voters agreed to tax themselves to expand library hours, library and service.",129,,
1038,0.97,40647.54,40652.812,We've seen the proposed budget from the Mayor is cutting new hours and programming in 2021.,129,,
1039,0.97,40652.812,40664.457,This budget amendment would replace all of that funding and stop all the cuts.,129,,
1040,0.97,40664.457,40673.599,All the departments faced large budget cuts in the Mayor's proposed budget.,129,,
1041,0.97,40673.599,40676.802,Those will come up.,129,,
1042,0.97,40676.802,40681.24,"Add it up, my office Fine-Tunes the calculations.",129,,
1043,0.97,40681.24,40691.05,"So far, my office identified $219 million in budget cuts to housing, parks, libraries, transportation transportation.",129,,
1044,0.97,40691.05,40699.925,The people's digit movement is demanding the city council increase the big business tax rate in the Amazon tax pass everyday the summer.,129,,
1045,0.97,40699.925,40705.131,Technically this would be a simple one page bill to change those or increase those tax rates.,129,,
1046,0.97,40705.131,40713.873,"In my view, ultimately will be a question of political will.",129,,
1047,0.97,40713.873,40714.707,It's a mathematical issue.,129,,
1048,0.97,40714.707,40723.516,"It's recessions, Regressive taxes, revenues we'll pass the austerity budget as Council or show up the budget by increasing revenues.",129,,
1049,0.97,40723.516,40734.36,"This afternoon, we'll have another budget amendment from my office to increase the tax rate to prevent the cuts to libraries and also other departments.",129,,
1050,0.97,40737.196,40744.437,Thank you very much Council member Sawant.,129,,
1051,0.97,40744.437,40744.77,Questions on.,129,,
1052,0.97,40744.77,40744.97,Okay.,129,,
1053,0.97,40744.97,40745.805,I have one question.,129,,
1054,0.97,40745.805,40752.545,"Asha, could you remind us, were there cost savings at all in this 2020 operation for libraries?",129,,
1055,0.97,40752.545,40765.991,Council member today and in the past reminded us ways in which libraries have adapted and also allocated personnel to various services to care for folks who are vulnerable under the Covid crisis.,129,,
1056,0.97,40765.991,40781.507,Is there any cost savings in operations this year that we could carry forward to next year and assume is a reduction.,129,,
1057,0.97,40781.507,40791.016,Trying to figure out if there's a way to accommodate or account for those reductions in services due to Covid.,129,,
1058,0.97,40791.016,40797.79,So I'll have to talk to the library about that specific piece.,130,,
1059,0.97,40797.79,40812.304,I would note that the library had already taken a $2.9 million general fund cut during the rebalancing this summer.,130,,
1060,0.97,40812.304,40826.018,That was mitigated using 1.69 in funds and operational savings from holding positions vacant and reducing operating expenses.,130,,
1061,0.97,40826.018,40827.987,It's possible that there are more savings than that.,130,,
1062,0.97,40827.987,40834.927,I believe most were used over the summer is to off set that general fund cut.,130,,
1063,0.97,40834.927,40836.762,I'm happy to follow up.,130,,
1064,0.97,40836.762,40838.164,Thank you so much.,131,,
1065,0.97,40838.164,40842.234,I am not seeing or hearing additional questions on.,132,,
1066,0.97,40842.234,40851.677,Will are there any additional questions on the libraries presentation overall colleagues or any comments that folks want to make?,132,,
1067,0.97,40851.677,40851.877,Okay.,132,,
1068,0.97,40851.877,40866.392,"Asha, thank you for walking us through this presentation and helping us better understand how the funding sources get rated to provide critical services to our communities for the libraries.",132,,
1069,0.97,40866.392,40866.792,Appreciate that.,132,,
1070,0.97,40866.792,40875.234,I have one overall question Asha that I'm wondering if you might get back to me on later or if you have the answer right now.,132,,
1071,0.97,40875.234,40876.735,That's great as well.,132,,
1072,0.97,40876.735,40880.539,Don't want to assume that this might require a little additional dig.,132,,
1073,0.97,40880.539,40893.619,Do you have any analysis on how the governor's order to allow libraries to open to 25% capacity in phase 2 would affect staffing cut or needs?,132,,
1074,0.97,40893.619,40909.335,Especially if we're going to retain the mobile library services for those most vulnerable in the community given that many people with the 25% opening are still going to have compromised immune systems and not able to come in person?,132,,
1075,0.97,40909.335,40914.707,Any knowledge of how that order affects what we are slated to offer for 2021?,132,,
1076,0.97,40914.707,40916.542,I do not at the moment.,132,,
1077,0.97,40916.542,40927.253,I think that order came out last week and so I'm happy to talk to the library about how they plan to incorporate that guidance into their plans and get back to you.,132,,
1078,0.97,40927.253,40927.82,Appreciate that.,133,,
1079,0.97,40927.82,40930.856,Happy to send that question through the appropriate channels.,133,,
1080,0.97,40930.856,40938.23,That's helpful in terms of our tracking.,133,,
1081,0.97,40938.23,40938.53,Great.,134,,
1082,0.97,40938.53,40940.099,Thank you.,134,,
1083,0.97,40940.099,40940.366,Okay.,135,,
1084,0.97,40940.366,40941.567,Okay.,135,,
1085,0.97,40941.567,40946.171,"Colleagues, I'm not seeing any additional questions.",135,,
1086,0.97,40946.171,40946.705,Thank you Council Juarez.,135,,
1087,0.97,40946.705,40966.458,"We'll look forward to learning more about this issue area as we consider possible add backs and the impacts the library specifically has on those that are trying to teach at home, keep engaged and socially Interis acting with folks while we're in this remote period offering critical services.",135,,
1088,0.97,40966.458,40988.814,Huge thank you to mt and to all our folks who are on the front lines offering services through the library traditional services and as Council member Juarez noted to those out there providing peace services in community and in many cases in dangerous positions given the spread of Covid.,135,,
1089,0.97,40988.814,40993.218,We want to thank them for work in our community to make sure they're cared for.,135,,
1090,0.97,40993.218,40997.89,"With that, we are going to go ahead and take a break folks.",135,,
1091,0.97,40997.89,41002.094,"If there's no objection, we will go into Recess until 2:00 P.M.",135,,
1092,0.97,41002.094,41003.329,You have a little extra time today.,135,,
1093,0.97,41003.329,41012.204,I'm going to go ahead and do that with the hopes to keep to our schedule and have you join us again this afternoon at 2:00 P.M.,135,,
1094,0.97,41012.204,41013.072,For the miscellaneous sections.,135,,
1095,0.97,41013.072,41016.675,I know many of us probably see that as a long break for lunch.,135,,
1096,0.97,41016.675,41020.846,I do hope this gives you extra time to get through the additional E-Mails.,135,,
1097,0.97,41020.846,41030.856,"I know many are receiving tons of E-Mails, calls, Constitent meetings regarding the budget enjoy this extra time.",135,,
