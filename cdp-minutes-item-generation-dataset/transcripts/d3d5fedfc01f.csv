51,0.97,290.056,300.199,Howard.,13,,
52,0.97,304.303,308.941,You've ignored the fact that more people have been killed by SPD.,14,,
53,0.97,308.941,316.149,That the SPD keeps killing folks experiencing mental health crisis and that the SPD faces no accountability for the abuse of protesters last year.,14,,
54,0.97,316.149,319.952,Then there were last month's headlines.,14,,
55,0.97,319.952,326.726,"Federal monitors cost millions with disputed results, Seattle's police watchdog is the case in point.",14,,
56,0.97,326.726,341.741,"Or report Seattle police stop black people, native Americans at a far higher rate than white people or order to resigns, claims puts OPA allegiances.",14,,
57,0.97,341.741,348.948,Opa and the Oig along with possible criminal acts committed by OPA director.,14,,
58,0.97,348.948,357.924,"During Council break, OPA director released a stunningly incompetent investigation into the last year's murder blaming Terry death on his own choices and decisions.",14,,
59,0.97,357.924,365.264,This Committee must hold the public forum to investigate these shocking failures and scandals.,14,,

63,0.97,382.915,391.491,"I want to start by saying thank you to the activists, organizers to end the deadly exchange.",16,,
64,0.97,391.491,398.431,The Democratic Socialists of America and especially Council member Sawant's office who have been fighting for this legislation.,16,,
65,0.97,398.431,410.51,Unfortunately but not surprisingly Herbold and the political establishment introduced an amount that would weaken our legislation and might exclude the Israeli state from being covered by the law.,16,,
66,0.97,410.51,414.213,Last summer's harass Toric black lives movement.,16,,
67,0.97,414.213,422.622,Police departments and Democratic party controlled cities across America carried out violent oppression of peaceful Marches.,16,,
68,0.97,422.622,425.558,Failed to hold Seattle police accountable for this violence.,16,,
69,0.97,425.558,433.533,In addition to banning SPD from learning how to Brutalize people from nations.,16,,
70,0.97,433.533,437.637,With full powers over the police.,16,,
71,0.97,437.637,437.937,Thank you.,16,,

74,0.97,449.649,450.283,"Hi, good morning.",18,,
75,0.97,450.283,454.053,Council bill 12012 started as an Anti-Israel initiative.,18,,
76,0.97,454.053,457.223,Now it pretends to be an Anti- police bill.,18,,
77,0.97,457.223,460.193,It is still an Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic effort.,18,,
78,0.97,460.193,464.964,The campaign behind the bill as you just heard is all about Israel.,18,,
79,0.97,464.964,468.734,If passed it will be Weaponnized against Israel and against Jews.,18,,
80,0.97,468.734,473.806,It will start with protests and may end with violence.,18,,
81,0.97,473.806,477.777,This is completely foreseeable and entirely preventable.,18,,
82,0.97,477.777,484.383,You are hereby put on notice Seattle has a problem with its police force it should reform the police.,18,,
83,0.97,484.383,489.822,Foreign governments and international travel did not cause SPD's problems.,18,,
84,0.97,489.822,500.733,Pointing fingers at other countries and scapegoating people does nothing to improve public safety or address police accountability and institutional racism.,18,,
85,0.97,500.733,506.939,Vote no on this hateful and dangerous bill.,18,,
86,0.97,506.939,511.11,Thank you.,19,,

89,0.97,525.157,532.565,We know a safe and health yes Seattle must be grounded in respect for all people.,20,,
90,0.97,532.565,541.641,Spd has shown documented patterns of violence and racism and are under court supervision.,20,,
91,0.97,541.641,547.747,The current exchanges with military are an opportunity for SPD to exchange worse practices.,20,,
92,0.97,547.747,552.518,"Worse practices for Israel means decades of documented human rights violations, surveillance.",20,,
93,0.97,552.518,553.819,This violence has no place anywhere.,20,,
94,0.97,553.819,557.623,We can make sure it does not become common practice here.,20,,
95,0.97,557.623,564.096,We must stop using our resources to support violations of international law.,20,,
96,0.97,564.096,567.567,We investing in community makes us safe.,20,,
97,0.97,567.567,570.903,Not racist and Militarized policing.,20,,

104,0.97,593.893,606.539,"As others have said, just really calling on the public safety committee to pass this legislation to prohibit SPD from training with all countries committing on going human rights abuses.",22,,
105,0.97,606.539,617.049,This feels so no nonsense and we know we should be investing in ways of safety that are centered in Bipoc communities and specifically black live communities.,22,,
106,0.97,617.049,625.024,When we invest in those solutions we keep all of us more safe instead of spending resources on these exchanges and worst practices.,22,,
107,0.97,625.024,629.495,Thank you for your time and for hearing this.,22,,
108,0.97,629.495,641.007,I think this is an essential and beautiful act that we can take in our city to protect human rights of all people.,22,,
109,0.97,641.007,641.774,Thank you.,22,,
110,0.97,641.774,644.744,Anna Powell.,23,,

113,0.97,647.713,650.149,I'm on the government registrations team for Doordash.,24,,
114,0.97,650.149,653.786,Thank you for this opportunity to share our concerns with the policy proposal.,24,,
115,0.97,653.786,664.563,"We care about the drivers, customers and retailers with who we Patroller and we're eager to promote their interests, including the importance of flexible work.",24,,
116,0.97,664.563,671.604,We appreciate your interest and are committed to working Collaboratively with each of you to find a workable compromise.,24,,
117,0.97,671.604,680.88,To get this legislation right we recommend careful consideration of an array of highly complicated regulatory provisions.,24,,
118,0.97,680.88,683.215,Took two years to develop.,24,,
119,0.97,683.215,686.952,Cncs are different from Tncs in numerous ways.,24,,
120,0.97,686.952,689.321,This work will require more careful deliberation.,24,,
121,0.97,689.321,705.838,We want to ensure that there's opportunity for meaningful negotiation and respectfully request the process and Timeline that allows necessary exchange of ideas and proposals to develop Dnc standards that are products and honest dialogues between stake holders.,24,,

125,0.97,718.284,726.959,"Hi, I'm a resident of district 3 and I'm speaking in support of Council bill 12042.",26,,
126,0.97,726.959,733.365,This legislation is in line with Defund movements which we heard strong support of yesterday.,26,,
127,0.97,733.365,738.27,As it will aid in Demilitarizing and make Seattle communities truly safer.,26,,
128,0.97,738.27,749.615,Mykonos sense for SPD to be training with countries that violate human rights according to international standards.,26,,
129,0.97,749.615,757.289,This legislation must be passed.,26,,
130,0.97,757.289,757.69,Thank you.,27,,
131,0.97,757.69,765.631,Our next Speaker is Nina.,27,,
132,0.97,765.631,766.065,Followed by Emily.,27,,
133,0.97,766.065,770.302,My name is Nina and I am a Jewish resident of Seattle.,28,,
134,0.97,770.302,785.584,"I'm also calling to ask you to support Council bill 12142 to prohibit the Seattle police Department from training with countries that are committing human rights blouses as many others have said, this bill is common sense for the city of Seattle.",28,,
135,0.97,785.584,795.227,As a human rights city affirmed resolution 31858 and 31929 the city is endorsing.,28,,
136,0.97,795.227,801.033,We need to stand behind those commitments to protect the human rights of those in our city.,28,,
137,0.97,801.033,807.139,We need to be investing in Community-Based solutions rather than mill Tarrization.,28,,
138,0.97,807.139,813.012,This is an easy and logical bill for the city of Seattle to be passing.,28,,
139,0.97,813.012,818.284,I encourage you all to be voting in fair of it.,28,,
140,0.97,818.284,823.789,Emily will be followed by Sonya.,29,,
141,0.97,823.789,824.023,Emily.,29,,
142,0.97,824.023,824.256,Hi.,30,,
143,0.97,824.256,828.527,Thank you for letting many me speak today.,30,,
144,0.97,828.527,843.576,I want to especially thank the rank and file activists including Jewish voice of peace and especially Council member Sawant for bringing forward this legislation today to end the deadly exchange.,30,,
145,0.97,843.576,848.747,And stop training with nation States who have violated basic human rights.,30,,
146,0.97,848.747,862.294,"I especially do though want to while I'm appealing for all Council members to vote yes, I want to speak really strongly against Council member Herbold's amendment.",30,,
147,0.97,862.294,868.334,I think especially it's really that it's written to potentially include the Israeli state.,30,,
148,0.97,868.334,872.304,Notice that refers to investigations quote within the country or territory boundaries.,30,,
149,0.97,872.304,885.818,"The ICC investigations as you know are about Israeli human rights violations in Gaza and the West Bank, which will argue are not technically within Israel or its territorial boundaries.",30,,
150,0.97,885.818,893.959,This is problematic and I don't think it should --,30,,
151,0.97,893.959,895.828,Thank you.,31,,
152,0.97,895.828,902.701,Our next Speaker is Sonya and followed by Tamara.,31,,
153,0.97,902.701,904.637,"Hi, I'm a working mom.",32,,
154,0.97,904.637,920.853,"I really want to thank all of the activists and organizers within the exchange, the Jewish voice for peace and especially Council member Sawant's office who has brought forward this.",32,,
155,0.97,920.853,924.256,I'm speaking against Herbold's amendment today.,32,,
156,0.97,924.256,927.893,Councilmember Herbold and other Democrats are arguing this amendment simplifies things.,32,,
157,0.97,927.893,931.096,I think it does the opposite.,32,,
158,0.97,931.096,939.138,It's a memo spending pages explaining the SPD would have to do research to determine if a country they want to train with has violated human rights.,32,,
159,0.97,939.138,944.376,I don't think that's a difficult search.,32,,
160,0.97,944.376,945.778,I don't agree there's any problem.,32,,
161,0.97,945.778,950.716,"If the police can't do that research, how on earth do they ever solve crimes?",32,,
162,0.97,950.716,958.057,There's ASO a problem that's be addressed about Exclouting important languages.,32,,
163,0.97,958.057,969.001,So what I really think Democratic establishment has failed to hold Seattle police accountable.,32,,
164,0.97,969.001,971.704,We need an oversight board.,32,,
165,0.97,971.704,982.247,"Thank you, our next Speaker.",33,,
166,0.97,991.29,1000.599,If you hit Star 6.,33,,
167,0.97,1000.599,1004.269,You have to hit Star 6 please.,33,,
168,0.97,1004.269,1005.471,There you go.,33,,
169,0.97,1005.471,1005.838,Perfect.,33,,
170,0.97,1005.838,1006.138,Thank you.,33,,
171,0.97,1006.138,1007.172,My name is Mary.,34,,
172,0.97,1007.172,1010.876,I serve as the director for the Antidefamation League in Seattle.,34,,
173,0.97,1010.876,1015.714,I'd like to share my concerns with the ordinance introduced by Council member Sawant.,34,,
174,0.97,1015.714,1023.822,As an organization that's taken U.S. law enforcement on trips abroad to widen their perspectives and share best practices we have an interest in this policy.,34,,
175,0.97,1023.822,1040.239,According to the proposal in it you read it there are dozens of countries that would be restricted from Partnering with SPD and the term Partnering is not defined and could have far ranging public safety implications.,34,,
176,0.97,1040.239,1045.244,"Canada, Britain, France, Italy, China, even the United States for our own human rights abuses.",34,,
177,0.97,1045.244,1059.291,"By preventing SPD from Partnering with law enforcement in our own country, law enforcement from border countries and law enforcement from Allied countries how can we assure our local police Department shares intelligence worth public safety and conducts day-to-day business.",34,,
178,0.97,1059.291,1068.467,This ordinance is a small ill conceived proposal that does not address systemic racism or Holisticlly reform policing.,34,,
179,0.97,1068.467,1075.007,Thank you so much for hearing.,34,,

185,0.97,1086.785,1095.594,"As a black woman part of three generations from Seattle I have seen repeated patterns of violence, racism from SPD.",36,,
186,0.97,1095.594,1099.998,Spd is under court supervision for excessive force.,36,,
187,0.97,1099.998,1102.701,Spd literally brutalized protesters for months.,36,,
188,0.97,1102.701,1109.775,I was tear gassed while I was talking about the atrocities that folks face around this city.,36,,
189,0.97,1109.775,1114.68,"12,000 community members told you loud and clear enough is enough, Defund SPD.",36,,

191,0.97,1116.081,1123.922,This legislation supports these on going demands by cutting back on funding for military training that puts the residents of Seattle in danger.,36,,
192,0.97,1123.922,1128.66,Stop SPD from training with foreign Militaries like the Israeli occupation forces.,36,,
193,0.97,1128.66,1137.836,Do the right thing and end this deadly exchange and I relinquish the rest of my time.,36,,
194,0.97,1137.836,1145.21,"Although on my tracking sheet marked spoke, I believe we skipped over her.",37,,
195,0.97,1145.21,1159.057,Let's go back up to Tamara Wilson.,37,,

203,0.97,1177.776,1182.314,I am calling because I am a black lives matter Organizer.,38,,
204,0.97,1182.314,1191.924,Last year I witnessed SPD attack protesters in the largest Multiracial movement in our country's history with tear gas and rubber bullets.,38,,
205,0.97,1191.924,1199.164,That was until Council member Sawant led the way on banning the police from using chemical weapons on peaceful protesters.,38,,
206,0.97,1199.164,1214.246,Later in the year I saw the free Palestine movement erupt across the world and learned in Realtime how interrelated both of our struggles against racist oppression of the black and Palestinian communities are linked in a very material way.,38,,
207,0.97,1214.246,1217.482,Link between our police forces.,38,,
208,0.97,1217.482,1228.427,There is no way that the Prezzive crowd control tactics that SPD engages in are not interrelated.,38,,
209,0.97,1228.427,1232.164,I'm calling to support Councilmember Sawant's legislation.,38,,
210,0.97,1232.164,1237.469,I want to speak against Councilmember Herbold's amendment.,38,,
211,0.97,1237.469,1238.036,Thank you.,39,,

224,0.97,1306.305,1313.111,Do not create artificial barriers that separate our people and discourage collaborative work.,42,,
225,0.97,1313.111,1323.455,"This began as Arrassist Anti- Israel initiative where in Seattle we benefit every day from exchanges with Israel in trade, education, medicine, Agriculture and security.",42,,
226,0.97,1323.455,1331.463,Now will impact more countries which are working with us to build better lives for their citizens.,42,,
227,0.97,1331.463,1333.999,This legislation has unintended consequences.,42,,
228,0.97,1333.999,1344.376,It condemns the collaborative International work that encourages good behavior.,42,,
229,0.97,1344.376,1346.712,Please stop it now.,42,,
230,0.97,1346.712,1351.75,Thank you.,42,,

243,0.97,1398.463,1407.806,Alive in district 6 and I am calling in to support CB 120142.,43,,
244,0.97,1407.806,1417.249,It only makes sense to stop training with police and military forces that have known human rights abuses.,43,,
245,0.97,1417.249,1420.619,I think it's pretty simple math there.,43,,
246,0.97,1420.619,1430.128,I think that we should support ending this deadly exchange.,43,,
247,0.97,1430.128,1436.268,Thanks.,43,,
248,0.97,1436.268,1440.572,Henry followed by Jim.,44,,

253,0.97,1457.155,1463.395,We stand with our member organizations and which have been Firelessly advancing this effort.,45,,
254,0.97,1463.395,1470.068,We stand against 73 years of illegal settler colonial occupation of the sovereign nation of Palestine.,45,,
255,0.97,1470.068,1477.175,Do we want to learn from war criminals like the Israeli defense forces.,45,,
256,0.97,1477.175,1483.915,The Ibf is recognized by numerous governments and institutions.,45,,
257,0.97,1483.915,1488.687,As a gross and habitual Violator of human rights.,45,,
258,0.97,1488.687,1489.688,Treated as enemy combatants.,45,,
259,0.97,1489.688,1501.299,I ask the city council do we want to teach the SPD how to treat the Seattle population as enemy combatants.,45,,

265,0.97,1535.767,1550.382,Conspiracy theory that tends to Whitewash the history of American racism and resulting excessive use of force by police towards black people in an attempt to shift the conversation to discourage Israel.,47,,
266,0.97,1550.382,1559.19,America has enough of its own racism to explain police brutality.,47,,
267,0.97,1559.19,1573.672,The idea training from Israel is related to police violence towards black people is a dangerous and false conspiracy theory.,47,,
268,0.97,1573.672,1577.242,The purveyors of anti-Semitism never talk about the end game.,47,,
269,0.97,1577.242,1587.819,Talking about the two state solution or making the Middle East only Arab with no Jewish state.,47,,

287,0.97,1645.91,1656.955,I want to ask the city of Seattle whether we want to be seen as a human rights Violator in collaboration with some of the worst purveyors of state violence.,51,,
288,0.97,1656.955,1670.535,Or we want to be seen as a city that stands for all peoples rights to uplift their voices in defense against abuse by the state.,51,,
289,0.97,1670.535,1681.446,I encourage the city of Seethe toll vote against--to stand against these exchanges and to support this legislation today.,51,,

297,0.97,1725.056,1730.395,The policy you're hearing about today.,53,,

305,0.97,1764.262,1770.368,I'm here because I'm tired of seeing gig work Apps manipulate and exploit the law.,55,,
306,0.97,1770.368,1776.007,I started doing gig work in 2014 because I needed to make ends meet while working in if the nonprofit sector.,55,,
307,0.97,1776.007,1782.447,"I don't do gig work any more, but I do work with job training programs and Nonprofits across the city and state.",55,,
308,0.97,1782.447,1799.697,"Many times I've seen clients in these programs leave support, leave good opportunities because they're sold false promises from these App company Thiazine every pan out into real opportunities with the security of employment that almost every other sector guarantees.",55,,
309,0.97,1799.697,1810.542,"We can change that by holding these App companies accountable, raising and guaranteeing decent pay and listening to gig workers about their needs, giving them a voice and a seat at the table.",55,,
310,0.97,1810.542,1819.484,"We need the pay up policy for gig workers in 2021 because it's what is right, what is fair and what is equitable.",55,,

318,0.97,1841.306,1853.551,Gig workers need lawmakers to standardize pay and set standards for emerging billion dollar industry by passing the proposed pay up policy.,57,,
319,0.97,1853.551,1854.085,I am partially disabled.,57,,
320,0.97,1854.085,1865.964,The gig industry is the only industry that allowed me to set my own hours while working at a pace and intensity that I'm physically comfortable with.,57,,
321,0.97,1865.964,1869.5,Thousands of people with hidden disabilities depend on gig work.,57,,
322,0.97,1869.5,1877.809,Gig work is our only source of income.,57,,
323,0.97,1877.809,1883.381,Gig workers should be afforded the same rights as traditional employees.,57,,

330,0.97,1906.237,1906.604,"Hi, sorry.",59,,
331,0.97,1906.604,1909.574,So I am also a gig worker.,59,,
332,0.97,1909.574,1916.281,I work with Insta cart and I am here to advocate for the pay in transparency.,59,,
333,0.97,1916.281,1924.355,Right now we don't have a lot of control over things that happen on our orders such as traffic and busyness and things that are out of stock.,59,,
334,0.97,1924.355,1929.961,We get Dinged for that and Insta cart really doesn't make any kind of concessions for that.,59,,
335,0.97,1929.961,1946.244,"Last week I did an order it took me 45 minutes to get through just the Checkout area so that $40 that really was pretty good pay ended up being less than $15, probably like $10 an hour.",59,,
336,0.97,1946.244,1950.281,That's something I can't control and I wasn't able to take another order.,59,,
337,0.97,1950.281,1956.921,I wasn't able to do anything that's essentially time I'm standing there and not getting paid for.,59,,
338,0.97,1956.921,1959.357,That's just not okay.,59,,
339,0.97,1959.357,1965.963,It's not very equal and I think we need to have a pay forward.,59,,
340,0.97,1965.963,1976.341,Our next Speaker is Elena followed by Kevin.,60,,
341,0.97,1976.341,1976.841,Good morning.,61,,
342,0.97,1976.841,1978.91,Here in support of pay up.,61,,
343,0.97,1978.91,1991.689,We have been part of labor community alliances over many years to win ground breaking campaigns that have made Seethal national leader in labor standards.,61,,
344,0.97,1991.689,1996.527,Gig workers have been excluded from these standards and are still left behind.,61,,
345,0.97,1996.527,2004.035,Gig companies get away with paying as little as $2 a job to the people who do the work.,61,,
346,0.97,2004.035,2015.947,We have allowed these companies to pay effectively a Subminimum wage for the Postmannallzed workers.,61,,
347,0.97,2015.947,2020.952,It's well past time to close this loophole in our labor standard.,61,,
348,0.97,2020.952,2031.062,Raising pay and providing basic protections to our lowest paid workers is a key piece of an equitable recovery alongside the Act at the Federal level.,61,,
349,0.97,2031.062,2037.468,Today' hearing on pay flexibility and transparency possibilities is a great step forward.,61,,
350,0.97,2037.468,2040.738,Please keep up the momentum and get pay up passed into law.,61,,
351,0.97,2040.738,2055.119,Our next Speaker will be followed by Aviona there you go.,62,,
352,0.97,2055.119,2055.72,"Yes, good morning.",63,,

355,0.97,2065.797,2067.198,I'm concerned about stable pay.,63,,
356,0.97,2067.198,2069.5,I perform gig work part time.,63,,
357,0.97,2069.5,2072.603,Lack of Transparentsy creates gig worker uncertainty.,63,,
358,0.97,2072.603,2079.811,We ask the Seattle city counsel sill to pass a Pay-Up policy because we need adequate representation.,63,,
359,0.97,2079.811,2085.149,I want the Seattle city Council to focus on stable pay so gig organizers may continue to work more effectively.,63,,
360,0.97,2085.149,2097.028,I appreciate your time and patience and thank you very much.,63,,

363,0.97,2100.731,2107.338,I too am a gig worker and a member of the Pay-Up campaign.,65,,
364,0.97,2107.338,2112.81,I believe the Pay-Up policy will help so many had at Terntive work Sykes.,65,,
365,0.97,2112.81,2116.147,I want this to be put in action this year.,65,,
366,0.97,2116.147,2125.857,I started doing gig work in 2017 because my mom was ill.,65,,
367,0.97,2125.857,2132.463,"I've experienced unwarranted penalties, unrealistic driving expectations from Apps assigning seniority to folks who have been logged in longer than I have.",65,,
368,0.97,2132.463,2135.733,For me this is the opposite of the purpose of using gig work.,65,,
369,0.97,2135.733,2145.243,For my life I need to be able to log in to see all the options at full Transparentsy and choose the deliveries that are going to serve me.,65,,
370,0.97,2145.243,2158.823,Not send me 20-Miles from my home for low pay that doesn't even equate the gas I now have as an expense to get back home or to my other gig.,65,,
371,0.97,2158.823,2163.928,We can change that by lifting full pay outs for the available Gigs.,65,,
372,0.97,2163.928,2168.266,We need the Pay-Up policy for gig workers.,65,,
373,0.97,2168.266,2168.733,Thank you.,66,,

381,0.97,2210.775,2214.745,I'm calling in support of Pay-Up policy.,67,,
382,0.97,2214.745,2218.849,I work in the gig economy because of Ageism and the work travels with me.,67,,

384,0.97,2222.62,2235.066,I worked in the Seattle area this summer at first I could make $300 and then an algorithm made it possible it to work the same amount of hours and put in the same amount of gas and only make $200.,67,,
385,0.97,2235.066,2238.235,I guess they call this throttling.,67,,
386,0.97,2238.235,2244.942,"So I worked all day every day for personal reasons and six weeks I put 10,000 miles on my vehicle.",67,,
387,0.97,2244.942,2255.92,I don't think that I could replace that vehicle with the money that I made if I were to be able to sustain that.,67,,
388,0.97,2255.92,2268.232,As drivers we genuinely care about our clients and sometimes we have to take time.,67,,
389,0.97,2268.232,2272.637,Uber eats have a tendency to send drivers on erroneous routes.,67,,
390,0.97,2272.637,2293.658,If it we were paid by the minute by the mile.,67,,
391,0.97,2303.1,2306.971,We're supposed to be out of sight and out of mind until needed.,68,,
392,0.97,2306.971,2313.411,That means the work we do goes unnoticed and is quite honestly taken for granted.,68,,
393,0.97,2313.411,2315.012,That needs to change.,68,,
394,0.97,2315.012,2328.793,It starts with a minimum age for everybody.,68,,

428,0.97,2501.565,2505.336,This is not hard mathematics.,73,,
429,0.97,2505.336,2521.852,When they ask for more time for true diligence what they're asking for is more time to figure out better ways to take more money from hard working Seethe.,73,,

445,0.97,2634.565,2648.812,And I don't agree with the removal of the requirement to provide public disclosure of aggregates records.,77,,

447,0.97,2653.484,2655.219,But generally I love this.,77,,

466,0.97,2738.502,2748.078,It is common sense that the SPD should not train with any other with a pattern of persistent human rights violations.,79,,
467,0.97,2748.078,2752.416,I appreciate that Council members are looking at ways to simplify and strengthen the legislation.,79,,

489,0.97,2846.376,2857.154,My other part-time job they did increase the pay and they decided so I've been deciding to focus on that work more.,87,,
490,0.97,2857.154,2861.858,Because I'm able to save more money through it.,87,,
491,0.97,2861.858,2867.698,And you know with this gig worker I think all gig jobs should be paying the same as the other one.,87,,

509,0.97,3016.146,3036.333,"Since we began meeting early in June my office and staff from other Council offices have met ten times to hear feedback from over 30 stake holders including representatives from network companies, worker advocates and workers.",91,,
510,0.97,3036.333,3050.547,On July 13th Council central staff reported to this committee updating us on those meetings basically walking us through the issues that there are decisions that need to be made.,91,,

523,0.97,3155.552,3156.486,I will highlight those.,93,,
524,0.97,3156.486,3161.358,I'll go over the proposal fairly quickly since it was discussed in July.,93,,
525,0.97,3161.358,3173.37,So to begin the Pay-Up proposal as it is called would be suite of labor standards that would offer protections for workers.,93,,
526,0.97,3173.37,3179.609,There are up to eight categories of presentations.,93,,
527,0.97,3179.609,3180.744,Several within an advisory board.,93,,
528,0.97,3180.744,3195.091,There would be amendments to the independent contractor protections ordinance that was passed last year just to make sure that all of the provisions and that legislation line up and align with the worker proposal.,93,,
529,0.97,3195.091,3214.711,"Probably up to six different pieces of legislation and the one that will be discussed this morning is what's called the minimum compensation legislation it addresses those top three topics of pay structure, transparency and flexibility.",93,,
530,0.97,3214.711,3220.183,Minimum compensation would be a creation of a new title.,93,,
531,0.97,3220.183,3229.926,Title 8 so everything in that title would be related to labor standards and you'd see here this is 8.37.,93,,
532,0.97,3229.926,3232.062,You can go ahead and Bookmark that.,93,,
533,0.97,3232.062,3245.976,"And in addition to the three main components of pay structure transparency and flexibility, labor standard components of notice of rights, Recordkeeping, prohibitions against retaliation.",93,,
534,0.97,3245.976,3252.349,It would be implemented and enforced by the office of labor standards.,93,,
535,0.97,3252.349,3274.204,The policy goals of a minimum compensation pay structure would be to set a single pay standard for all businesses to ensure to compensate workers if it R their time and their expenses.,93,,
536,0.97,3274.204,3291.087,The types of workers covered would be those providing on demand or Prescheduled physical services so that would not cover At-Base workers that have been deemed to have significant bargaining power and influence over their terms and conditions of work.,93,,
537,0.97,3291.087,3304.034,There would be a list created by office of labor standards that would exempt certain types of services that could only be performed with licenses.,93,,
538,0.97,3304.034,3310.24,Also those with that would include creative work and sale or rental of goods of real estate.,93,,
539,0.97,3310.24,3323.82,The types of network companies that would be covered would be those that have 250 or more At- base workers worldwide regardless of where they work.,93,,
540,0.97,3323.82,3333.997,The initial policy decisions for these threshold issues include removal of an exemption for Online orders resulting in the payment of 1000 or more dollars.,93,,
541,0.97,3333.997,3358.288,Also based on stake holder feedback there is a new requirement for Ols or I guess the ability of office of labor standards to engage in discretionary rule making what kind of work constitutes engaged time when it might seem to be like a not work related activity.,93,,
542,0.97,3358.288,3368.064,If there's an overnight pet sitting service the worker might be engaged in sleep times or other periods of Offduty time when they can pursue their own personal activities.,93,,
543,0.97,3368.064,3370.367,Another example might be overnight home care.,93,,
544,0.97,3370.367,3385.181,For those sorts of situations that Ols director could issue rules on what would rise to the level of Compensable time and Noncompensable time in those situations.,93,,
545,0.97,3385.181,3386.683,Councilmember Herbold I see you have a question.,93,,
546,0.97,3386.683,3387.817,That was an error.,94,,
547,0.97,3387.817,3392.522,I raised a Enthis open lowered my hand.,94,,
548,0.97,3392.522,3393.223,Appreciate it.,94,,
549,0.97,3393.223,3393.59,Understood.,95,,
550,0.97,3393.59,3407.737,Just as a point of reference the Department of labor has issued similar kinds of rules for what institutes work time for overnight live in home care workers and the employment context.,95,,
551,0.97,3407.737,3412.575,So there is precedent for issuing these kinds of rules.,95,,
552,0.97,3412.575,3427.29,"Next the heart of the legislation, the pay standard for workers it would be comprised of a minimum pay for each minute that the worker engages in work.",95,,
553,0.97,3427.29,3432.262,Also a minimum paid for each engaged mile.,95,,
554,0.97,3432.262,3449.179,The formula for each engaged minute includes the base rate of whatever the minimum compensation is for employees in Seattle broken down to a per minute standard along with additional pay for expenses that the workers are bearing.,95,,
555,0.97,3449.179,3459.322,The associated cost factor and a time they're completing their work that might not be reflected in the actual time that err engaging in the services.,95,,
556,0.97,3459.322,3466.796,I'll provide more information on that as I go through each of these different types of factors.,95,,
557,0.97,3466.796,3469.532,I'll go back and give a 2021 example.,95,,
558,0.97,3469.532,3478.174,"So for the associated cost factor, again, that would be payment for the baseline expenses that are born by App- based workers.",95,,
559,0.97,3478.174,3496.025,And the director would be the ability to adjust the associated cost factor in the future after three years--[inaudible]--you see here a list of the type of expenses that the workers.,95,,
560,0.97,3496.025,3496.793,Payroll tax.,95,,
561,0.97,3496.793,3501.397,Contributions to stay pay family medical leave.,95,,
562,0.97,3501.397,3501.865,Workers compensation.,95,,
563,0.97,3501.865,3502.165,Et cetera.,95,,
564,0.97,3502.165,3510.907,So when the expenses for those are added up it comes to a total rate of 1.13.,95,,
565,0.97,3510.907,3512.775,"The time factor, same premise.",95,,
566,0.97,3512.775,3521.05,It would be payment for the additional working time that a worker needs to engage in to complete the services for the companies.,95,,
567,0.97,3521.05,3528.091,And you see here what comprises that time it's time to take rest breaks.,95,,
568,0.97,3528.091,3528.591,Time to review offers.,95,,
569,0.97,3528.591,3533.263,Time to be available for the next offer.,95,,
570,0.97,3533.263,3537.066,Time to complete administrative tasks.,95,,
571,0.97,3537.066,3540.403,In total this results in 12.5 minutes of time.,95,,
572,0.97,3540.403,3540.937,Two things to note.,95,,
573,0.97,3540.937,3547.944,First this is different than the proposal that was discussed in mid July had this had a total of 15 minutes.,95,,
574,0.97,3547.944,3554.15,Council members reduced that to 12.5 minutes in the presentation that was loaded to the agenda my error.,95,,
575,0.97,3554.15,3559.055,I noted it was 11 minutes instead of 12.5.,95,,
576,0.97,3559.055,3568.231,This presentation has been revised and I'll be sure to get that revised version to the clerk so that everyone can have that for their records.,95,,
577,0.97,3568.231,3572.769,The Council members reduced the time and the area of reviewing offers.,95,,
578,0.97,3572.769,3579.375,Down from 5 minutes to three minutes and then the time for administrative tasks.,95,,
579,0.97,3579.375,3582.011,I believe that was three minutes to two minutes.,95,,
580,0.97,3582.011,3589.085,Altogether it is a total of 12.5 minutes.,95,,
581,0.97,3589.085,3600.43,The mileage factor is something that would be added to each engaged mile that the worker has to complete an offer.,95,,
582,0.97,3600.43,3611.374,It would pay workers for miles they drive that are needed to perform the work but might not necessarily be reflected in a time it takes to complete an offer.,95,,
583,0.97,3611.374,3625.822,So nonexclusive list of examples could be the 1.25- miles to travel to the next location or 1.25-Miles to travel to the place for a rest break or Restroom access.,95,,
584,0.97,3625.822,3631.16,Altogether it's a mileage factor of 1.25.,95,,
585,0.97,3631.16,3647.844,So when these factors are plugged in to the formula you can see here that the per minute amount to get to the Seattle minimum wage.,95,,
586,0.97,3647.844,3651.247,Gets you to 28 cents.,95,,
587,0.97,3651.247,3659.789,And then that would be--I see I didn't fix this so I apologize.,95,,
588,0.97,3659.789,3660.69,I'm sorry.,95,,
589,0.97,3660.69,3662.692,It'd be 1.21 times 1.13.,95,,
590,0.97,3662.692,3663.059,I apologize.,95,,
591,0.97,3663.059,3680.009,I did not update this to reflect the new amounts so I will update those and that will reflect the correct per minute of engaged time.,95,,
592,0.97,3680.009,3681.878,I apologize for that.,95,,
593,0.97,3681.878,3682.445,Thank you.,96,,
594,0.97,3682.445,3685.481,You do get a sense of the formula.,97,,
595,0.97,3685.481,3691.754,There is also a minimum amount per offer and that would be at least $5.,97,,
596,0.97,3691.754,3696.159,"No matter how small the service is, the offer would need to at least pay $5.",97,,
597,0.97,3696.159,3712.508,And then the office of labor standards director would be able to annually adjust that minimum offer amount or would have to every year to reflect the rate of inflation.,97,,
598,0.97,3712.508,3721.851,We see a list of policy decisions in the area of pay structure.,97,,
599,0.97,3721.851,3727.256,Associated time factor 15 minutes to 12.5 minutes.,97,,
600,0.97,3727.256,3730.259,New requirement for discretionary rule making.,97,,
601,0.97,3730.259,3742.538,The director would in and out have the ability to adjust the associated time factor based on new information that the director would have that previously was not available to the director.,97,,
602,0.97,3742.538,3752.115,The new requirement for three years before the director can adjust that associated cost factor or the time factor.,97,,
603,0.97,3752.115,3757.253,The next major component of the legislation is about transparency.,97,,
604,0.97,3757.253,3776.339,Making sure that workers and customers have information they need in order to select the offers that they fulfill and customers to know what companies to support so they know what's happening on the ground with their purchases.,97,,
605,0.97,3776.339,3783.513,The major part of transparency is the would be the workers right to up front information about their offers.,97,,
606,0.97,3783.513,3787.784,You can see here a list of what would comprise all of that information.,97,,
607,0.97,3787.784,3791.287,They'd be able to look at it for at least three minutes.,97,,
608,0.97,3791.287,3797.827,They'd have a best estimate of engaged time and mileage to complete the offer.,97,,
609,0.97,3797.827,3800.63,Guaranteed minimum amount of payments.,97,,
610,0.97,3800.63,3801.097,Location of works.,97,,
611,0.97,3801.097,3807.236,The physical requirement of work and contents of unsealed products.,97,,
612,0.97,3807.236,3818.347,They would receive information when handling contents of unsealed products might pose health risks or violate their own personal beliefs.,97,,
613,0.97,3818.347,3829.792,"Next would be electronic receipts sent to workers and customers within 24 hours of completing those offers, weekly information to the workers on completing their offers and payment.",97,,
614,0.97,3829.792,3848.344,14 days of notice before any significant changes to their payment structure and then disclosure to office of labor standards of aggregate records of work performed by the workers and the offers made to the workers.,97,,
615,0.97,3848.344,3850.012,"The policy decisions, yes, council member Herbold.",97,,
616,0.97,3850.012,3877.974,"I just want to flag for folks general awareness and correct me if I'm wrong, that last area of transparency may result in some amendments to the legislation that we recently passed that covers a broader group of contract workers but is also focused on transparency for contract workers.",98,,
617,0.97,3877.974,3879.008,Is that correct?,98,,
618,0.97,3879.008,3884.747,So are you speaking of the disclosure to office of labor.,99,,
619,0.97,3884.747,3885.348,"Oh, the word disclosure.",99,,
620,0.97,3885.348,3889.218,I see how that led to your question.,99,,
621,0.97,3889.218,3890.786,Number five relates to --,99,,
622,0.97,3890.786,3891.887,"No, Oh no.",100,,
623,0.97,3891.887,3913.142,"I was--the legislation that the council passed I guess was it may or June for the transparency rights of contracted workers, that ordinance covered a broader group of contracted workers than the one we're talking about today in this bill.",100,,
624,0.97,3913.142,3925.187,"There may need to be some amendments to that ordinance in order to accomplish the goals, the transparency goals in this ordinance.",100,,
625,0.97,3925.187,3925.588,Is that correct?,100,,
626,0.97,3925.588,3925.821,Yes.,101,,
627,0.97,3925.821,3926.022,Yes.,101,,
628,0.97,3926.022,3926.322,Absolutely.,101,,
629,0.97,3926.322,3931.06,Writ large I thought you were referring to number five on that list.,101,,
630,0.97,3931.06,3935.498,"But Yeah, go ahead, Karina.",102,,
631,0.97,3935.498,3936.866,Absolutely.,103,,
632,0.97,3936.866,3947.71,The independent contractor protections ordinance will need amendments to make sure that these two laws align with each other and that ordinance is much broader.,103,,
633,0.97,3947.71,3956.619,However it does have some components that were drafted with intention of covering the experiences of App-Based workers.,103,,
634,0.97,3956.619,3960.022,These two pieces of legislation have different requirements for the companies.,103,,
635,0.97,3960.022,3963.092,So there will need to be some amendments.,103,,
636,0.97,3963.092,3975.071,"Now that you mention it, can we talk a little more about item five since we did hear some mention of it in public comment.",104,,
637,0.97,3975.071,3998.361,Can you talk a little bit about the question of the aggregate offers on facilitated by the worker platform and what was not included in this particular policy preference expressed by the draft ordinance.,104,,
638,0.97,3998.361,3998.694,Yeah.,105,,
639,0.97,3998.694,4005.234,The original proposal would have required the companies to provide public disclosures.,105,,
640,0.97,4005.234,4016.245,Some sort of Website or place that the companies would share with the world Aggregated information on offers facilitated on this worker platform.,105,,
641,0.97,4016.245,4021.05,A whole host of information about worker earnings and other items.,105,,
642,0.97,4021.05,4038.034,"The change to this is that instead of companies requiring that information to the public, the companies would provide that information directly to Ols in both Aggregated and Disaggregated format.",105,,
643,0.97,4038.034,4046.008,Would provide Ols with a tremendous opportunity to use that information to learn more about what's happening in the world of App-Based work.,105,,
644,0.97,4046.008,4055.651,To use it for their enforcement and they could manipulate that to help inform their implementation and enforcement efforts.,105,,
645,0.97,4055.651,4060.423,That information could still be requested as part of a public disclosure request by the public.,105,,
646,0.97,4060.423,4072.068,But it wouldn't be made directly to the public in the way that it was in the initial proposal.,105,,
647,0.97,4072.068,4086.549,The structure of companies providing labor standards with a wide range of data mirrors the records requirement and the transportation network company minimum compensation ordinance that's required to pay ride share drivers minimum compensation as well.,105,,
648,0.97,4086.549,4092.855,There's precedent for this idea that exists for Tncs and ride share drivers.,105,,
649,0.97,4092.855,4098.627,This would mirror it for App- based workers.,105,,
650,0.97,4098.627,4101.096,Thank you so much.,106,,
651,0.97,4101.096,4105.334,You see those policy decisions there.,107,,
652,0.97,4105.334,4110.206,Let's see if there's anything else we haven't already discussed.,107,,
653,0.97,4110.206,4119.148,"Number one, the initial proposal, had a requirement to provide businesses with electronic receipts.",107,,
654,0.97,4119.148,4120.516,That requirement has been removed.,107,,
655,0.97,4120.516,4126.755,Along with the requirement to provide workers with annual and quarterly tax information.,107,,
656,0.97,4126.755,4140.87,Then the change to the public disclosure that was required of companies that was just discussed.,107,,
657,0.97,4140.87,4148.444,I want to flag the decision to not have that be a requirement is not a comment on whether or not it's a good idea or a bad idea.,108,,
658,0.97,4148.444,4163.425,It just does not fit within the scope of this ordinance which is not focused on the rights of third party businesses but is focused on the rights of contract workers.,108,,
659,0.97,4163.425,4174.503,There may be another place where we want to consider inclusion of a requirement like this.,108,,
660,0.97,4174.503,4184.613,Then the final major policy piece of this legislation regards flexibility and the worker's ability to freely choose jobs.,109,,
661,0.97,4184.613,4189.218,Reflect jobs and be able to do work that fits their schedule.,109,,
662,0.97,4189.218,4195.591,Especially as they are categorized as independent contractors.,109,,
663,0.97,4195.591,4198.594,So this list Itemizes the flexibility requirements.,109,,
664,0.97,4198.594,4205.134,No requirements to be a logged on to the platform for specific dates or times.,109,,
665,0.97,4205.134,4207.736,No adverse action based on availability.,109,,
666,0.97,4207.736,4212.708,Right to cancel an offer with cause and so on.,109,,
667,0.97,4212.708,4217.813,No policy decisions in that area which brings this presentation to next steps.,109,,
668,0.97,4217.813,4225.854,There are still a number of issues for further consideration awaiting feedback from stake holders.,109,,
669,0.97,4225.854,4228.39,And office of labor standards.,109,,
670,0.97,4228.39,4230.426,Those would include he effective date of the law.,109,,
671,0.97,4230.426,4239.535,Making sure to allow office of labor standards sufficient time to develop rules and implementation and outreach.,109,,
672,0.97,4239.535,4245.274,And for the companies to develop their methods for complying with this ordinance as well.,109,,
673,0.97,4245.274,4251.08,Next joint liability for end consumer.,109,,
674,0.97,4251.08,4257.92,This topic addresses situations where there's questions about would the consumer ever be responsible for compliance with this ordinance.,109,,
675,0.97,4257.92,4272.701,Whether it be the payment that's made to the worker or information that's required of the customer or required of the company to give the worker about physical requirements of an offer or contents of unsealed districts.,109,,
676,0.97,4272.701,4283.846,So the way the legislation is written right now is that it does not Definitivety say whether the end consumer would be responsible for compliance.,109,,
677,0.97,4283.846,4289.518,It's open ended and it would be determined on a case by case basis.,109,,
678,0.97,4289.518,4293.989,It's sort of Standard language in employment law for employees for joint liability.,109,,
679,0.97,4293.989,4302.197,It's whether an entity is directly or indirectly accountable or responsible for controlling the worker.,109,,
680,0.97,4302.197,4304.667,So that's what's in this legislation right now.,109,,
681,0.97,4304.667,4310.239,So it would be no definitive statement on the end consumer.,109,,
682,0.97,4310.239,4317.613,However the independent contractor protections ordinance has definitive language that does not hold the end consumer responsible for compliance.,109,,
683,0.97,4317.613,4335.064,So it sort of is related to amending that law but there could be a decision on either to definitively say something Úin this law or to amend the other law to remove that language.,109,,
684,0.97,4335.064,4335.931,They should be consistent.,109,,
685,0.97,4335.931,4342.104,Why would we want to hold the consumer responsible?,110,,
686,0.97,4342.104,4354.049,This is not something I want to be the subject of an E-mail campaign from Uber eats or Insta cart users on that.,110,,
687,0.97,4354.049,4363.492,I don't think that is the intent to hold the users of these Apps responsible for the actions of the Apps.,110,,
688,0.97,4363.492,4363.892,I'm concerned.,110,,
689,0.97,4363.892,4373.902,Are you just flagging that this is something undefined or would there be a policy reason to have joint liability?,110,,
690,0.97,4373.902,4378.674,There could be a benefit to leaving it open ended.,111,,
691,0.97,4378.674,4387.616,Depending on the nature of the legal protection there could be reason for end consumers to be responsible.,111,,
692,0.97,4387.616,4392.254,Currently for the domestic worker rights ordinance there's open language that doesn't say.,111,,
693,0.97,4392.254,4414.543,It's got the acting indirectly or directly language that this law has and office of labor standards has interpreted it as holding an end consumer responsible for complying with the domestic worker bill of rights.,111,,
694,0.97,4414.543,4423.585,If an end consumer is paying a company to deliver a service and that consumer doesn't have input into what is paid to the worker.,111,,
695,0.97,4423.585,4427.256,It's like going into a store and buying a shirt.,111,,
696,0.97,4427.256,4432.261,That consumer count have any impact on what the company pays the worker to sell that shirt.,111,,
697,0.97,4432.261,4440.369,"However there are some situations, some laws where the end consumer could influence how the worker is treated.",111,,
698,0.97,4440.369,4446.074,For example thinking of discrimination and Harassment.,111,,
699,0.97,4446.074,4452.381,In the context of domestic workers interfering to take a meal break or a rest break.,111,,
700,0.97,4452.381,4458.42,It would depend on each kind of law.,111,,
701,0.97,4458.42,4470.799,My understanding is office of labor standards is concerned if there's different language and different laws that could negatively impact the interpretation of domestic worker bill of rights.,111,,
702,0.97,4470.799,4476.972,There are situations where domestic workers could be hired via an App.,111,,
703,0.97,4476.972,4480.209,That is something to consider.,111,,
704,0.97,4480.209,4486.682,How is the TNC legislation handle it issue of joint liability?,112,,
705,0.97,4486.682,4502.331,My sense is that it probably has that same open ended language of acting indirectly or directly.,113,,
706,0.97,4502.331,4515.043,I'm struggling with the exception of something that happens directly in between the consumer and the worker.,114,,
707,0.97,4515.043,4527.723,I'm struggling to imagine a scenario where the end consumer has responsibility for how the App treats the worker.,114,,
708,0.97,4527.723,4544.773,"With the exclusion of something that actually happens in the interaction between for that, you know, that short period of time when you're having an interaction.",114,,
709,0.97,4544.773,4545.607,Appreciate you flagging the issue.,114,,
710,0.97,4545.607,4549.678,The question is whether or not to definitively say anything about it.,115,,
711,0.97,4549.678,4571.3,Or just to leave it as is and to allow office of labor standards to develop policy guidance and information to the community which could consist of office of labor standards is not going to--a policy decision to not Prioritize any enforcement action against a consumer or how they would analyze that situation.,115,,
712,0.97,4571.3,4572.701,So something to consider.,115,,
713,0.97,4572.701,4575.07,Thank you.,116,,
714,0.97,4575.07,4575.671,Yeah.,117,,
715,0.97,4575.671,4612.841,"The third issue for consideration is definitions and categories of types of offers and there's been feedback that from it office of labor standards that the categories of on demand and versus Pre-Scheduled offers could be, they're so precise especially for the Prescheduled types of offers that can could lead to inefficient enforcement if they would be required to go into every single offer for an entire company and hundreds of workers and multiple offers completed each day to determine is it this offer or that offer?",118,,
716,0.97,4612.841,4626.021,So there's some thought that maybe could be done on maybe ways to shore up these definitions to make them more broad.,118,,
717,0.97,4626.021,4634.296,Another idea could be to amend the Recordkeeping requirements.,118,,
718,0.97,4634.296,4641.303,Provide off was of labor standards with Spreadsheets that what these offers fall into.,118,,
719,0.97,4641.303,4643.138,Office of labor standards wouldn't have to do that work.,118,,
720,0.97,4643.138,4650.012,Company would do it for them and they would be required to provide those records.,118,,
721,0.97,4650.012,4656.051,Another idea could be for the receipts to workers to have that information.,118,,
722,0.97,4656.051,4657.786,This offer or that offer.,118,,
723,0.97,4657.786,4660.522,Weekly statements to have that information as well.,118,,
724,0.97,4660.522,4673.602,A variety of ideas for helping to make enforcement easier for office of labor standards and to help workers understand what rights they have and what payment.,118,,
725,0.97,4673.602,4680.375,Next is a notice of contents of unsealed products.,118,,
726,0.97,4680.375,4686.014,Right now there's a requirement for notice of those contents.,118,,
727,0.97,4686.014,4691.72,When there might be a possibility of those contents violating personal beliefs.,118,,
728,0.97,4691.72,4698.226,Someone might not want to transport a particular kind of item.,118,,
729,0.97,4698.226,4699.494,That is quite broad.,118,,
730,0.97,4699.494,4718.547,So there's already precedent in employment law that employers are required to provide religious accommodations and so that could be something to consider perhaps replacing the concept of might violate personal beliefs with might violate religious beliefs.,118,,
731,0.97,4718.547,4728.724,And then that would have a whole body of law to help companies and workers navigate those situations.,118,,
732,0.97,4728.724,4729.224,It would be narrower.,118,,
733,0.97,4729.224,4736.865,That would be the result of that.,118,,
734,0.97,4736.865,4740.569,Other issues for further consideration regard enforcement.,118,,
735,0.97,4740.569,4757.986,Right now the law allows office of labor standards to designate a minimum daily amount for money that is owed to the works if the company doesn't provide sufficient records to make a precise determination on that remedy.,118,,
736,0.97,4757.986,4764.292,It would like or could help office of labor standards to at least set a floor for a minimum amount.,118,,
737,0.97,4764.292,4765.794,That would be required for that.,118,,
738,0.97,4765.794,4776.138,"For example, I believe that TNC ride share minimum compensation ordinance has a minimum daily amount of $200.",118,,
739,0.97,4776.138,4782.778,This legislation has a complaint procedure similar to the independent contractor protections ordinance.,118,,
740,0.97,4782.778,4785.08,Right now is open ended.,118,,
741,0.97,4785.08,4793.221,If there's an interest in having specific protocols then that is something for Council members to consider.,118,,
742,0.97,4793.221,4795.891,The enforcement section has a navigation program.,118,,
743,0.97,4795.891,4800.228,Also something that is in the independent contractors protection ordinance.,118,,
744,0.97,4800.228,4819.548,This is an office of labor standards outreach program that provides information to workers on court procedures and court systems so they choose to use that forum for resolving complaints and beliefs that they have not been paid properly.,118,,
745,0.97,4819.548,4829.858,Council members might want to include information on private arbitration as part of that program given that many workers are required to settle disputes through private arbitration.,118,,
746,0.97,4829.858,4831.126,Something to consider.,118,,
747,0.97,4831.126,4832.027,It wouldn't be legal advice.,118,,
748,0.97,4832.027,4839.301,It would just be simply information on how to navigate private arbitration systems.,118,,
749,0.97,4839.301,4859.154,"And then next, potentially a number of amendments to independent contractor protections ordinance since the Precontract and disclosures and payment disclosures are different than a little bit different and similar than what is required in this legislation.",118,,
750,0.97,4859.154,4860.822,And do cover App-Based workers.,118,,
751,0.97,4860.822,4867.028,So then as far as future Stakeholder meetings.,118,,
752,0.97,4867.028,4871.266,As I understand it will there will be meetings to address all the different pieces of legislation.,118,,
753,0.97,4871.266,4875.17,You see here a possible way to organize them.,118,,
754,0.97,4875.17,4875.871,Minimum compensation.,118,,
755,0.97,4875.871,4876.972,Right to access work.,118,,
756,0.97,4876.972,4880.308,That would be Deactivation and background checks.,118,,
757,0.97,4880.308,4882.043,Access to Restrooms.,118,,
758,0.97,4882.043,4885.547,The establishment of the Advisory board.,118,,
759,0.97,4885.547,4889.751,Protections against discrimination and right to reasonable accommodations.,118,,
760,0.97,4889.751,4893.922,Then amendments to the independent contractor legislation.,118,,
761,0.97,4893.922,4901.429,And that is all for the presentation.,118,,
762,0.97,4901.429,4902.53,Thank you.,119,,
763,0.97,4902.53,4929.958,Wondering real quickly talk a little bit about the topic of an issue just because I have a feeling it'll come up again and this is relating to discussion around an opt out of payment for engaged miles at the IRS standard mileage rate.,119,,
764,0.97,4929.958,4958.953,This draft legislation includes the use of the IRS standard mileage rate for some question about whether or not we should allow for a possible opt out because of a belief that drivers may not be able to itemize their deductions with the--when filing with the IRS if this language was left in.,119,,
765,0.97,4958.953,4961.389,Wondering if you could cover that too.,119,,
766,0.97,4961.389,4973.034,"Yeah, so that issue came up in Stakeholder meetings whether or not workers would benefit from the ability to opt out of payment for their engaged miles.",120,,
767,0.97,4973.034,4982.644,That payment would be at the standard IRS mileage rate which is 56 cents cents per mile.,120,,
768,0.97,4982.644,4998.66,I'm going to Scroll back semi slowly back to the formula.,120,,
769,0.97,4998.66,5007.669,More research would be helpful for helping Council members make this determination.,120,,
770,0.97,5007.669,5012.14,Initially my understanding is that payment from it companies is simply payment.,120,,
771,0.97,5012.14,5026.087,So the way that the companies get to how much they pay would be established by this ordinance which is like a wage an hour issue is one way of thinking it.,120,,
772,0.97,5026.087,5032.827,When workers get that payment they'd be free to choose whether to do standard deductions or itemized deductions or no deductions.,120,,
773,0.97,5032.827,5043.371,That would be an IRS tax issue.,120,,
774,0.97,5052.213,5054.949,So that still needs to have more research.,120,,
775,0.97,5054.949,5064.292,That's not something listed on here but that is happening behind the scenes to gather more information.,120,,
776,0.97,5064.292,5064.793,Thank you.,121,,
777,0.97,5064.793,5076.805,Are there any other questions from Council members?,121,,
778,0.97,5076.805,5083.078,Looking for any raised hands.,121,,
779,0.97,5083.078,5083.912,Not seeing any.,121,,
780,0.97,5083.912,5087.415,I don't hear from anybody.,121,,
781,0.97,5087.415,5092.921,I'll just close discussion on this particular update.,121,,
782,0.97,5092.921,5095.19,Really appreciate the efforts of external Stakeholders.,121,,
783,0.97,5095.19,5118.413,The efforts of the office of labor standards to be engaged in the development of this draft bill and of course Karina and Council central staff and the work of other Council member staff who have been involved thus far.,121,,
784,0.97,5118.413,5126.454,Stake holder conversations to discuss this proposed minimum compensation.,121,,
785,0.97,5126.454,5126.988,Transparency legislation.,121,,
786,0.97,5126.988,5144.139,It is one of several bills I think a minimum three or four bills associated with the recommendations.,121,,
787,0.97,5144.139,5148.743,Likely on the schedule we're on continue into the new year.,121,,
788,0.97,5148.743,5164.926,I recognize that our folks who are associated with work Washington and the pay up campaign are really hoping that we have a full vote before the end of the year.,121,,
789,0.97,5164.926,5168.196,My goal is to introduce the primary bill.,121,,
790,0.97,5168.196,5180.675,The bill that handles the issue of minimum compensation flexibility and transparency to have that introduced by the end of the year.,121,,
791,0.97,5180.675,5201.996,Just want to make sure really this is a soft of check in with committee members so that when these bills are moving forward that you are comfortable with the concepts that we're making.,121,,
792,0.97,5201.996,5210.038,Some preliminary decisions on in this draft bill so when something is introduced that would be familiar with the COB Septembers.,121,,
793,0.97,5210.038,5213.741,"If not, supportive of the decisions made.",121,,
794,0.97,5213.741,5228.222,So that if you feel that a different policy choice should be made on some of these concepts that you are well informed.,121,,
795,0.97,5228.222,5250.678,I want to close out with something I read on labor day Seattle times reporter and he was writing in recognition of labor day about the impact of the growing prevail lance of gig work and impediments to organized labor.,121,,
796,0.97,5250.678,5254.515,It will take time for the pendulum to swing back to more fairness.,121,,
797,0.97,5254.515,5258.653,Seattle will be a good place to watch what happens.,121,,
798,0.97,5258.653,5271.532,I just want to say to Council members and the public that I hope we can continue to make that so as we have in the past with the development of this policy.,121,,
799,0.97,5271.532,5271.899,Thank you all.,121,,
800,0.97,5271.899,5276.237,Moving on to the next item on the agenda.,121,,
801,0.97,5276.237,5281.009,Will the clerk please read in agenda item number two.,121,,

809,0.97,5314.142,5314.409,Sure.,124,,
810,0.97,5314.409,5319.28,I'm Pete Holmes your city attorney.,124,,
811,0.97,5319.28,5320.114,Good morning.,125,,
812,0.97,5320.114,5332.06,I'm Jenna Roberts an assistant city attorney doing a Prefiling diversion work.,125,,
813,0.97,5332.06,5337.031,And I'm Daicia Mestas from choose 180.,126,,
814,0.97,5337.031,5347.809,The city attorney's office has operated a Pre-Filing diversion program for adults age 18 to 24.,127,,
815,0.97,5347.809,5358.586,The key focus of today's presentation is the racial equity Toolkit for expanding the Pre-Filing Di version program to adults 25 and older.,127,,
816,0.97,5358.586,5368.296,Council requested this as a statement of legislative intent adopted with the 2020 budget sponsored by Council President Gonzalez.,127,,
817,0.97,5368.296,5375.236,Like many had things this is taking additional time to the impact of--due to the impact of the Covid pandemic.,127,,
818,0.97,5375.236,5387.715,I am so pleased the city attorney's office has been working with due diligence and attention to this priority.,127,,
819,0.97,5387.715,5402.997,Work on these issues dates back to the establishment in 2015 by the city Council of a prisoner and community corrections Reentry work group which issues its report in 2018.,127,,
820,0.97,5402.997,5423.985,We are going to hear not just the outcome of the Prefiling racial equity Toolkit kit on the expansion of Prefiling diversion.,127,,
821,0.97,5423.985,5433.694,A little bit of an update on the success of the existing program choose 180.,127,,
822,0.97,5433.694,5438.866,Due to time constraints we weren't able to hear in that in committee.,127,,
823,0.97,5438.866,5441.402,We'll touch on that as well.,127,,
824,0.97,5441.402,5448.743,Want to mention in my--the first point I made was a reference to the existing Pre- filing diversion program.,127,,
825,0.97,5448.743,5459.854,Úi described it as the program for adults age 18 to 24.,127,,
826,0.97,5459.854,5485.513,Want to just suggest that even though that age of folks is maybe considered adults that from what we know about brain development that this is a population of folks who really benefit from Pre-Filing diversion because of their youth.,127,,
827,0.97,5485.513,5510.238,"But that said, we have learned a lot of lessons about this program that is focused on young people and I I'm optimistic that some of those lessons learned show this is a good program for older folks as well.",127,,
828,0.97,5510.238,5510.605,Thank you.,128,,
829,0.97,5510.605,5516.844,It's great to see you and Council President Gonzalez virtually albeit.,128,,

832,0.97,5527.822,5532.159,I just want to reiterate what you said.,128,,

835,0.97,5537.765,5542.737,It was dedicated from it the beginning to be in partnership with community.,128,,
836,0.97,5542.737,5561.188,You're going to see today from Jenna and Daicia that this has been a resounding success.,128,,
837,0.97,5561.188,5571.465,"To provide individuals to receive support, opportunities of support from the community by way of diversion in a way that increases public safety.",128,,
838,0.97,5571.465,5587.214,"You'll hear from the Prefiling diversion team lead and hear about the efforts on our efforts, the office wide to minimize these impacts of the criminal legal system.",128,,
839,0.97,5587.214,5590.551,This team was a proud member of the Reentry work group.,128,,

844,0.97,5624.118,5630.791,The team is a member of the community organized Washington drivers licensing task force.,128,,
845,0.97,5630.791,5635.296,That was active in efforts revolving around driving law license.,128,,
846,0.97,5635.296,5643.237,That in turn led to the Supreme Court issuing an order to pause license suspensions during the pandemic.,128,,
847,0.97,5643.237,5660.321,This team is also worked on a number of efforts related to clearing old warrants not covered by the warrant sunset policy and includes a motion that Jenna submitted asking the court to clear warrants for prostitution cases.,128,,
848,0.97,5660.321,5663.424,Some of which were issued as far back as the early 2000S.,128,,
849,0.97,5663.424,5674.135,So I'm going to close by saying this program captures the essence of everything that's near and dear to me.,128,,
850,0.97,5674.135,5685.813,It's important to this city and its efforts to reduce disproportionately in a criminal legal system and I'm asking you and thanks you for your support and asking you to expand it.,128,,
851,0.97,5685.813,5697.191,"None of this work though let's be really clear, would be possible without the community that guided the work and the nonprofit community partners who are actually doing the work.",128,,
852,0.97,5697.191,5704.865,And I just have to say once again that choose 180 has been a God send.,128,,
853,0.97,5704.865,5714.742,Thank you Council for funding the racial equity Toolkit to look at this program to expand it for young adults 25 and older.,128,,
854,0.97,5714.742,5718.145,You know the amazing thing is you should take credit.,128,,
855,0.97,5718.145,5724.218,You sought this funding two weeks before George Floyd was murdered.,128,,
856,0.97,5724.218,5727.388,I think that that's something you should all keep in mind.,128,,
857,0.97,5727.388,5747.775,It demonstrates your foresight and the partnership that we have had to try and advance the cause of social justice.,128,,
858,0.97,5747.775,5749.877,The expansion while I'm in office.,128,,
859,0.97,5749.877,5753.447,We're talking about work that's hopefully going to start next year.,128,,
860,0.97,5753.447,5756.45,We're not sure who is going to be leading this office at that point.,128,,
861,0.97,5756.45,5761.388,"I'm committed and that's why I'm here to make sure the tool is available, the expanded tool kit.",128,,
862,0.97,5761.388,5783.043,"I would just add as a closing Úcomment that everybody for people who disagree with diversion as a principle, our numbers show that the thousands you deep backlog we need this tool.",128,,
863,0.97,5783.043,5792.453,"To the haters out there, and there are haters out there, I just want to Reemphasize that our numbers, our data show the program is effective.",128,,
864,0.97,5792.453,5803.731,And that we are simply not going to work our way through a thousands deep criminal case backlog without programs like this.,128,,
865,0.97,5803.731,5804.131,So thank you.,128,,
866,0.97,5804.131,5817.444,Promise I'd try to keep it brief.,128,,
867,0.97,5820.981,5824.485,"We can do both and Jenna, I'm going to turn it over to you.",128,,
868,0.97,5824.485,5830.024,Going to Miss working with you.,128,,

874,0.97,5861.388,5865.726,Focus on the mainstream diversion programs.,129,,
875,0.97,5865.726,5873.701,The yet to be developed adult diversion program for individuals over 25 and older for which we just concluded our Toolkit.,129,,
876,0.97,5873.701,5881.575,We'll focus most of today's presentation on the racial equity tool kit.,129,,
877,0.97,5881.575,5887.514,I think it's helpful to first hear about the model of diversion we're talking about in partnership with community.,129,,
878,0.97,5887.514,5906.133,"So at this point it's my pleasure to turn it over to Daicia Mestas choose 180's workshop coordinator to provide more information about how choose has been supporting young people, especially during these tough times.",129,,
879,0.97,5906.133,5906.533,"Hi, everyone.",130,,
880,0.97,5906.533,5946.807,During Covid we only had to take a month off then we were able to quickly shift our workshops to an Online platform and we were able to provide laptops to the young adults that we were working with or if they were experiencing homelessness we were able to meet with them in a park setting outside that way we could go through our curriculum with them which consists of a goal setting exercise that we call compass and once they are done with the workshop and they get their charge diverted we're able to connect them with a specialist that does things like Mentorship or help them search and apply for jobs.,130,,
881,0.97,5946.807,5968.495,And we also received a grant where we were able [inaudible] incarcerated or have some involvement in the system so we're able to relate to them in that way.,130,,
882,0.97,5968.495,5976.77,They feel heard and we also have a counselor they're able to go see for free.,130,,
883,0.97,5976.77,5991.118,We get a lot of people that want to stay connected to us after our workshops and we're able to help them out with a lot of things.,130,,
884,0.97,5991.118,5993.487,"Thank you so much, Daicia.",131,,
885,0.97,5993.487,5999.159,I think the real thing that we're talking about here with Pete and Daicia is this partnership that we have.,131,,
886,0.97,5999.159,6011.038,"Beauty is the partnership with community and it allows community to support the young people that have gone through the program in a way that they are, you know, choosing to continue to work with choose.",131,,
887,0.97,6011.038,6019.847,The design of the program is really to give them all these extended supports that they can take advantage of and they continue to do that.,131,,
888,0.97,6019.847,6024.885,We have young people work with choose 180 for months into years.,131,,
889,0.97,6024.885,6042.569,This is a really great program that we're excited to be working with choose 180 an we so a lot of opportunity for expanding this type of partnership with community to allow this opportunity for people ages 25 and above.,131,,
890,0.97,6042.569,6049.343,As we talked about in 2018 the Reentry work group recommended expanding as one of its core strategies.,131,,
891,0.97,6049.343,6056.25,Our office was in full support of this and we're thankful that Council provided funding for us to undergo that Toolkit.,131,,
892,0.97,6056.25,6066.593,In the winter of 2021 we partnered with Baker consulting who hosted a total of seven focus group sessions with two different groups of community members.,131,,
893,0.97,6066.593,6075.769,The groups consisted of community members well known and trusted.,131,,
894,0.97,6075.769,6077.571,Various experiences were represented.,131,,
895,0.97,6077.571,6079.973,Including lived experience.,131,,

900,0.97,6094.521,6100.561,The participants met virtually and the final report contains several recommendations.,131,,
901,0.97,6100.561,6113.273,The diversion should be as broad as possible when it comes to charges that are eligible with many people calling to divert all but the most serious crimes.,131,,
902,0.97,6113.273,6119.746,We must eliminate barriers to diversions.,131,,
903,0.97,6119.746,6121.849,"Criminal history exclusion, arbitrary referrals and financial barriers.",131,,
904,0.97,6121.849,6143.07,"Number three, that the diversion program must be designed and delivered by community and number four that services must focus on restorative practices.",131,,
905,0.97,6143.07,6158.986,We have met these recommendations it should be noted there was a significant perspective among some community members calling for abolition of the criminal legal system.,131,,
906,0.97,6158.986,6168.629,The Prefiling diversion program is designed to help individuals receive the supports they need to thrive.,131,,
907,0.97,6168.629,6177.804,92% of the young adults who have completed the program have not had another criminal conviction.,131,,

915,0.97,6208.402,6219.646,I know we had intended to hear from you all sooner and the agenda got away from us and we didn't have an opportunity.,134,,
916,0.97,6219.646,6235.929,"Wanted to start off by just publicly expressing my appreciation and gratitude for the public service of city attorney Pete Holmes who has been our city attorney for many, many years here at the city.",134,,

919,0.97,6243.937,6265.926,I first started talking to you about your vision around Recidivism programming and really truly a harm reduction approach to prosecutorial work in 2014 when I was legal Council to the then Mayor.,134,,
920,0.97,6265.926,6284.811,You didn't get the funding you envisioned and wanted then and I was lucky enough to be elected to the city council in it 2015 and you and I got to work early on on Championing and envisioning what this program could look like.,134,,
921,0.97,6284.811,6293.654,We all pushed ourselves to really center racial equity and have that analysis in the center of this work to produce the outcomes we're talking about now.,134,,
922,0.97,6293.654,6319.046,I want to give you a tremendous amount of credit for leading the way together with community on making these investments in the first place and on creating the foundation that is necessary to really truly address the root causes of why young folks become engaged with a criminal system to begin with.,134,,
923,0.97,6319.046,6356.683,"I think that you have acknowledged together with our community partners that the response of government is not to just continue to engage in failed policy of Incarceration but to really truly understand the root causes of what is creating this behavior and to invest in solutions to those root causes and to divert youth towards a life of, you know, understanding that we the city care about their livelihood and belonging within our city.",134,,
924,0.97,6356.683,6371.565,I want to thank you for all of the work of you done together with choose 1807 and others within the city attorney's office to really bring us to a place where we should all be proud of the results we're talking about here.,134,,
925,0.97,6371.565,6379.506,This is the really important and hard work that is not always popular as you mentioned.,134,,
926,0.97,6379.506,6379.873,But should be.,134,,
927,0.97,6379.873,6395.622,This is really a good Standard and I'm really proud to be able to continue to champion these efforts together with you and with our partners at choose 180.,134,,

934,0.97,6419.412,6421.515,I'll just say that.,135,,
935,0.97,6421.515,6424.284,We couldn't have done it alone.,135,,

937,0.97,6424.584,6425.852,Thank you.,136,,
938,0.97,6425.852,6437.164,Hand it over to Council member Lewis who I want to just also thank him for his role in the work around choose 180.,136,,
939,0.97,6437.164,6463.857,I remember I think it was in maybe 2019 I had the privilege of watching Council member Lewis conduct a choose 180 session and recognized that he has done some hands on work of these types it of diversion programs as well.,136,,
940,0.97,6463.857,6465.959,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",137,,
941,0.97,6465.959,6470.697,I'm the next panel presenter so thanks for introducing me.,137,,
942,0.97,6470.697,6471.832,"No, I'm just kidding.",137,,
943,0.97,6471.832,6472.799,I appreciate.,137,,
944,0.97,6472.799,6480.307,I think that was in the fall of 2018.,137,,
945,0.97,6480.307,6481.308,That is a good Segue.,137,,
946,0.97,6481.308,6481.608,Yeah.,138,,
947,0.97,6481.608,6483.476,Because you weren't a council member.,138,,
948,0.97,6483.476,6493.386,I was not moonlighting as a choose 180 session coordinator as a council member.,139,,
949,0.97,6493.386,6494.855,This job keeps us busy enough.,139,,
950,0.97,6494.855,6517.143,I did just want to take a moment to briefly talk about I guess I'll just start since of you Cued it up this way how exceptionally formative that work with choose 180 was to my own conceptions and ideas about how justice can and should work.,139,,
951,0.97,6517.143,6541.067,The ability to be hands on and really see the possible of so many people in our community to rise above and shape and form a new system of accountability.,139,,
952,0.97,6541.067,6554.814,Really shows we can do something different and that our unchallenged preconceptions about how justice is administered in this country and abroad is not how things have to be.,139,,
953,0.97,6554.814,6560.687,There are models that are successful in it providing results.,139,,
954,0.97,6560.687,6568.395,What we've seen from the preliminary stage of this program over the last three years is we have data that CONFIRMS that.,139,,
955,0.97,6568.395,6582.809,It's not just something we're saying or aspiring to we have data that shows how we can scale certain practices.,139,,
956,0.97,6582.809,6589.349,Particularly in our misdemeanor practice.,139,,
957,0.97,6589.349,6590.35,Only Adjudicates Misdemeanors.,139,,
958,0.97,6590.35,6596.59,There's been fairly widespread confusion about that in a lot of quarters.,139,,
959,0.97,6596.59,6614.708,I do think that it really shows how there's a lot of advantages that I think we have in the city from having a system that primarily INTERSECTS and deals with Misdemeanors where this kind of experimentation.,139,,
960,0.97,6614.708,6621.414,Specifically on those types of offenses in the different and innovative way.,139,,
961,0.97,6621.414,6651.044,"It was a really great privilege, Pete, to be an assistant city attorney that helped Pioneer this program under Jenna's leadership over my years of service and your office and I look forward to that continuing becoming a larger part of our practice and becoming a cornerstone of how we do this work.",139,,
962,0.97,6651.044,6651.811,Thank you so much.,139,,
963,0.97,6651.811,6654.814,"Thank you, council member Lewis.",140,,

967,0.97,6676.87,6694.587,But I am interested to know whether or not the city attorney's office put forward a request for the expansion of this program.,140,,
968,0.97,6694.587,6699.759,We did.,141,,
969,0.97,6699.759,6706.833,There's some support in there.,141,,

999,0.97,6903.796,6908.635,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",147,,
1000,0.97,6908.635,6915.341,Good morning to everyone and everyone who is watching or listening to this meeting.,147,,
1001,0.97,6915.341,6939.065,My Council office has worked closely with a wide range of Union and community members and black live the matter and Palestinian rights activists to ban the Seattle police Department from engaging in training with States or state agencies and nation States or nation state agencies that are International and human rights Violators.,147,,
1002,0.97,6939.065,6964.657,I want to thank all the activists . special thanks to the rank and file members of Association who passed--who put forward a resolution in their representative assembly which passed with an overwhelming majority.,147,,
1003,0.97,6964.657,6972.699,This is the second time I'm having the privilege of thanking in this way.,147,,
1004,0.97,6972.699,6991.117,As Council members will recall sea members played a critical role for us to win the Renters rights from my office to ban school year Evictions of public school workers and school students.,147,,
1005,0.97,6991.117,6997.824,This type of rank and file Union led activities so crucial in putting together a progressive agenda.,147,,
1006,0.97,6997.824,7017.41,"This legislation before the public safety committee today would ban Seattle police from training or having any exchange with police forces, intelligence agencies, security services or other armed forces of any nation.",147,,
1007,0.97,7017.41,7029.389,The International bill of rights which together form the basic humanitarian standards that have been agreed upon internationally over the last 70 years.,147,,
1008,0.97,7029.389,7048.474,"Committing to uphold civil and human rights and in fact not passing this legislation in its form without watering it down, without introducing ambiguities would contradict the resolutions and policy.",147,,
1009,0.97,7048.474,7053.112,Some of the opponents have claimed this unjustly Singles out the state of Israel.,147,,
1010,0.97,7053.112,7065.291,It does not as any plain reading shows the bill bans training with the military police intelligence agencies and security forces of any State found to violate these basic human rights standards.,147,,
1011,0.97,7065.291,7073.332,It should be mentioned that these are very basic standards.,147,,
1012,0.97,7073.332,7088.281,It's not something that is over and above what is agreed upon by mainstream organizations.,147,,
1013,0.97,7088.281,7092.885,Which the SPD has done in the past.,147,,
1014,0.97,7092.885,7108.334,"Responsible for Brutalizing the Palestinian people for decades and were roundly condemned worldwide by labor unions, faith communities, Jewish communities.",147,,
1015,0.97,7108.334,7108.801,Human rights groups.,147,,
1016,0.97,7108.801,7109.368,Progressive organizations.,147,,
1017,0.97,7109.368,7116.943,This past spring for their brutal and disproportionate assault on the people of Gaza.,147,,
1018,0.97,7116.943,7124.617,Their attempted Eviction of Palestinians from their homes and their instigation of violent right wing mobs.,147,,
1019,0.97,7124.617,7146.572,Also I would have the public recall the letter that Council members Mosqueda and Herbold sent to President Biden.,147,,
1020,0.97,7146.572,7147.94,I really appreciate that.,147,,
1021,0.97,7147.94,7159.585,"By Israeli human rights, mainstream human rights organizations to have found to have repeatedly violated the Geneva violations.",147,,
1022,0.97,7159.585,7166.659,Systemic human and political rights violations and their important report titled.,147,,
1023,0.97,7166.659,7167.093,Across the board.,147,,
1024,0.97,7167.093,7177.77,If there are other nation States.,147,,
1025,0.97,7177.77,7181.941,As the Israeli state has done.,147,,
1026,0.97,7181.941,7194.82,I would also share that this summer my office circulated in the community calling on such a ban and the response was remarkable within the first 48 hours.,147,,
1027,0.97,7194.82,7196.756,More than 4800 community members had signed.,147,,
1028,0.97,7196.756,7211.837,Just wanted to share one or two comments from the people because these are voices of our constituents and it's important to include that in our discussion.,147,,
1029,0.97,7211.837,7215.808,A resident wrote Geneva convention Violators have no place in our community.,147,,
1030,0.97,7215.808,7225.818,Is Seattle a police state city affiliated with the worst offenders.,147,,
1031,0.97,7225.818,7230.289,Katherine a member of Ciu 775.,147,,
1032,0.97,7230.289,7237.83,Our police are too Militarized.,147,,
1033,0.97,7237.83,7241.968,Copsresipcops precipitate.,147,,
1034,0.97,7241.968,7245.471,"Local 280 wrote simply, our community is not a war zone.",147,,
1035,0.97,7245.471,7260.72,"Tarrization of our police force has on on going post 9/11 and has only gone to endanger our people and create fear, mistrust and anger towards the people we're supposed to trust.",147,,
1036,0.97,7260.72,7264.624,Comment goes on to talk about the violations of the Geneva convention.,147,,
1037,0.97,7264.624,7264.991,I won't go on.,147,,
1038,0.97,7264.991,7282.475,Right now there are no restrictions on Seattle law on Seattle police engaging in such training and that's why this legislation is necessary and of course it is appropriate that this is coming in the wake of historic George Floyd protests.,147,,
1039,0.97,7282.475,7296.689,I hope Council members will see this legislation as part of the work that basically every Council member has pledged to do in responding to the demand from the black lives movement.,147,,
1040,0.97,7296.689,7304.964,I will reserve comments for when we come to the discussion on the amendment.,147,,
1041,0.97,7304.964,7305.331,Thank you.,147,,
1042,0.97,7305.331,7307.9,Thank you so much Council member Sawant.,148,,
1043,0.97,7307.9,7319.812,I think you in your introductory remarks raise an important part of background they want to be transparent with the public about.,148,,
1044,0.97,7319.812,7335.194,This version of the bill seeks to identify verifiable human rights violations using a nation neutral standard.,148,,
1045,0.97,7335.194,7387.747,"The earlier version of the legislation before it was introduced was a piece of legislation that exclusively banned exchanges, Trainings, and partnerships with Israel and I informed the proponents of this legislation that I was uninterested in introducing a piece of legislation that called out a particular country and really appreciate their efforts to work to fulfill my goals for this legislation although I'm not the sponsor I am the chair of this Committee and they understood that my willingness to put this on an agenda in my committee was tied to that particular criteria and objective.",148,,
1046,0.97,7387.747,7399.558,With that I will hand over to central staff to walk us through the bill.,148,,
1047,0.97,7399.558,7400.393,Thank you.,149,,
1048,0.97,7400.393,7401.127,Good morning.,149,,
1049,0.97,7401.127,7408.968,Greg Doss here with Ann Gorman who is going to be giving her first central staff presentation today.,149,,
1050,0.97,7408.968,7419.412,I'm going to provide a quick overview and then turn it over to Ann to provide analysis on the bill and then together we're going to go over a couple of amendments that are proposed on the bill.,149,,
1051,0.97,7419.412,7434.727,"So just by way of introduction this bill Council bill 120142 would prohibit s, D training with certain foreign governments.",149,,
1052,0.97,7434.727,7457.783,"It does so in a manner that would prohibit exchanges, partnerships with military forces or police forces or intelligence agencies or security services or armed forces of any country and prohibiting travel to any foreign country that is, that meets three different categories.",149,,
1053,0.97,7457.783,7464.056,One that is not a party to the International Covenant on civil and political rights.,149,,
1054,0.97,7464.056,7472.965,Another that is not a party to the International Covenant on economic and social and cultural rights.,149,,
1055,0.97,7472.965,7474.567,That's sort of the first category.,149,,
1056,0.97,7474.567,7512.204,"The second one is that it has been found the country has been found in the last ten years by an international court or United Nations body to have been violating either of those two covenants I just mentioned or third, and the last bucket is that it has been documented by an international court or UN body to have committed violations of the fourth Geneva convention or that has not--and that such violations have not been fully remedied to the satisfaction of that court or the body that documented those violations.",149,,
1057,0.97,7512.204,7520.512,If a country fits into any one of those three categories SPD could not train with them.,149,,
1058,0.97,7520.512,7530.122,Actually in a much wider way couldn't coordinate exchanges or potentially even communicate in any training capacity with them.,149,,
1059,0.97,7530.122,7558.05,So with that I'm going to turn it over to my colleague Ann who will tell you about some really good extensive work that she has done analyzing this bill and its effect on training with SPD in the context of human rights and international law which I think you'll find from what Ann says is not that easy to understand.,149,,
1060,0.97,7558.05,7561.287,"Go ahead, Ann, please.",149,,
1061,0.97,7561.287,7561.854,Thanks.,149,,
1062,0.97,7561.854,7564.823,"Thank you, Greg.",150,,
1063,0.97,7564.823,7565.958,Thank you.,150,,
1064,0.97,7565.958,7579.905,"In researching this bill and international human rights law and treaties more generally, we unearthed a couple of policy considerations for committee members in thinking about this bill.",150,,
1065,0.97,7579.905,7591.417,It could be difficult for SPD staff to determine the countries that had violated the Iccpr and Iescr and or the fourth Geneva convention.,150,,
1066,0.97,7591.417,7595.521,Or to determine if any country had remedied violations that have been found in the past.,150,,
1067,0.97,7595.521,7613.839,The reason for this is that there is no publicly available list of countries that have violated these treaties or this convention or that have remedied previously identified violations.,150,,
1068,0.97,7613.839,7626.151,"There is something called the UN jurisprudence Database but its output is Pdf documents, not data.",150,,
1069,0.97,7626.151,7632.491,Which is what SPD would need in order to apply the legislation as currently written.,150,,
1070,0.97,7632.491,7648.24,Second consideration is that these treaties the Iccpr and Iascr are not the only measures of a country's human rights practices.,150,,
1071,0.97,7648.24,7659.118,Both of those treaties were established in 1966 and since then the Innovated nations has created eight additional treaty bodies.,150,,
1072,0.97,7659.118,7664.957,Each of which has a specific Purview respect to human rights.,150,,
1073,0.97,7664.957,7673.766,Each of these treaties addresses subjects or aspects of human rights about which the Iscr and Iccpr were silent.,150,,
1074,0.97,7673.766,7686.111,So that's just a consideration those two documents may not identify everything that we're interested in identifying.,150,,
1075,0.97,7686.111,7701.493,"Finally, as Greg started to talk about, the broad language in a bill would prohibit training programs, exchanges or partnerships with police forces in countries that met the bill's criteria.",150,,
1076,0.97,7701.493,7731.123,"It does not define these terms so there's some concern that if they were interpreted broadly SPD would be enjoined from some activities such activities as collaborative research, learning and teaching best practices and simply discussion of issues related to law and justice and cross national issues.",150,,
1077,0.97,7731.123,7734.66,Are there any questions?,150,,
1078,0.97,7734.66,7734.927,Yes.,151,,
1079,0.97,7734.927,7735.461,Council member Lewis.,151,,
1080,0.97,7735.461,7736.228,I see your hand.,151,,
1081,0.97,7736.228,7736.829,Thank you.,152,,
1082,0.97,7736.829,7744.67,Would this be a time for general questions to central staff?,152,,
1083,0.97,7744.67,7744.97,Indeed.,153,,
1084,0.97,7744.97,7745.237,Okay.,154,,
1085,0.97,7745.237,7751.677,Well first I want to thank Greg and Ann for Cueing this up and finally having a hearing on this.,154,,
1086,0.97,7751.677,7754.947,I feel like we've been talking about this for a while.,154,,
1087,0.97,7754.947,7761.353,I was surprised to review this and see there's not a training definition.,154,,
1088,0.97,7761.353,7769.061,"I mean if we're prohibiting training, I would think we'd want to be fairly clear about what practices we're prohibiting.",154,,
1089,0.97,7769.061,7776.135,I think that would be another area of uncertainty with the Department.,154,,
1090,0.97,7776.135,7777.436,We're talking about what countries fall in the box.,154,,
1091,0.97,7777.436,7811.77,"I did look at the summary in one of the attachments and it looks like there's going to be no training in St. Kitts and Nevis in our future, that's good, but I did just want to ask because I think in addition to finding what countries fall in those boxes is also determining what conduct is prohibited and there doesn't seem to be any definitions in this that give guidance to the Department.",154,,
1092,0.97,7811.77,7813.405,Central staff if you want to take this on.,155,,
1093,0.97,7813.405,7816.441,This is an issue I did flag for central staff.,155,,
1094,0.97,7816.441,7824.116,I would be interested in working on that issue between now and full council.,155,,
1095,0.97,7824.116,7827.619,But Council central staff?,155,,
1096,0.97,7827.619,7837.863,"No, I agree Councilmember Lewis this is one of the issues we flag in our staff report that the language is very broad.",156,,
1097,0.97,7837.863,7838.497,Definitions would be helpful.,156,,
1098,0.97,7838.497,7841.3,That was a concern of SPD as well.,156,,
1099,0.97,7841.3,7843.836,Can I ask just a quick follow up then?,157,,
1100,0.97,7843.836,7856.882,"Because I think that this is also related if it we--so if it we do ultimately define training, I do have another question in terms of when it would kick in.",157,,
1101,0.97,7856.882,7872.764,"I mean I know this is no longer a bill specifically about Israel, but in one of the formulas envisioned Israel would be included in a country that would fall within the scope of this ordinance.",157,,
1102,0.97,7872.764,7893.719,There has been some conversation publicly about an Antidefamation League exchange that former chief best attended a few years ago in Israel which has been cited as a reason to Reate this ordinance to prevent that from occurring.,157,,
1103,0.97,7893.719,7897.856,I'm not aware whether or not the police Department actually paid for that exchange.,157,,
1104,0.97,7897.856,7909.835,And this is something I think I'll actually request information from the Department and the Anti-Defamation League on if either are watching please send it to my office.,157,,
1105,0.97,7909.835,7926.685,"If the Anti-Defamation League merely invited chief best and then paid for her expenses on that exchange, my read of this is that would not actually be impacted because the Department is not paying.",157,,
1106,0.97,7926.685,7928.553,She was invited in her personal capacity.,157,,
1107,0.97,7928.553,7932.057,"Obviously if the Department did pay for it, that would be different.",157,,
1108,0.97,7932.057,7948.774,But my question now is if that distinction that I'm throwing out there is an actual distinction or if it would cover personal capacity even if no Seattle money went to pay for it.,157,,
1109,0.97,7948.774,7954.046,I think the ordinance refers to participation not who is paying.,158,,
1110,0.97,7954.046,7957.783,But I will let Council central staff handle that one.,158,,
1111,0.97,7957.783,7975.267,Council member I think that any time an SPD officer is wearing a uniform and representing the Department they are representing the SPD policy manual.,159,,
1112,0.97,7975.267,7985.477,I think that I would be forbidden under this ordinance from participating in that training.,159,,
1113,0.97,7985.477,7988.213,I will clarify with the law Department.,159,,
1114,0.97,7988.213,8002.627,"If they went as a civilian without representing a Department on their personal time, that would be something that I would have to--I'll ask for more information on.",159,,
1115,0.97,8002.627,8007.432,"Because I think there's--go, council member Sawant.",160,,
1116,0.97,8007.432,8008.867,Just to clarify.,161,,
1117,0.97,8008.867,8021.146,"Greg's absolutely right that actually when my office was looking at drafting this, we intentionally avoided using language that would make it specifically about public resources being used for this.",161,,
1118,0.97,8021.146,8034.359,"Obviously it would be in our view much more egregious if public resources were used for such exchanges and such training sessions, but we don't want to restrict it just to that.",161,,
1119,0.97,8034.359,8036.661,It would be opposed regardless as Greg explained.,161,,
1120,0.97,8036.661,8051.009,"Council member, as an example if an SPD officer is wearing the uniform and they're working an Offduty job at a nightclub, they still have to abide by the SPD policy manual and they still have to represent the Department.",162,,
1121,0.97,8051.009,8058.65,So the same would be true if they were flying overseas to train with a foreign military.,162,,
1122,0.97,8058.65,8069.194,If they were wearing the uniform and representing the Department then I don't believe they would be able to do so with this legislation in place.,162,,
1123,0.97,8069.194,8081.239,"But to use an example of something that would probably fall outside of the scope if an SPD officer let's say went and did birthright, right?",163,,
1124,0.97,8081.239,8082.374,Like in it Israel.,163,,
1125,0.97,8082.374,8102.461,"On their own time just as a civilian that has no nexus whatsoever with, you know, a military exchange or training that would be outside of the scope of this because they're going over there as, you know, just as an individual rather than as an officer.",163,,
1126,0.97,8102.461,8105.03,I doubt that you're going to be able to prohibit that.,164,,
1127,0.97,8105.03,8107.632,I'd have to check with the attorneys.,164,,
1128,0.97,8107.632,8112.003,"And to be clear, I'm not seeking to prohibit that.",165,,
1129,0.97,8112.003,8119.678,I'm trying to clarify the scope of the ordinance since in corners it's Unvague and Nonclear.,165,,
1130,0.97,8119.678,8122.948,I appreciate that central staff believes that would be outside the scope.,165,,
1131,0.97,8122.948,8123.215,Yeah.,166,,
1132,0.97,8123.215,8129.988,I will get back to you with an official legal answer.,166,,
1133,0.97,8129.988,8136.995,"I would just add that I mean I'm, Yeah, would appreciate clarification on that.",167,,
1134,0.97,8136.995,8143.101,In my view just to reiterate what I believe Greg said and forgive me if I'm Misquoting you.,167,,
1135,0.97,8143.101,8174.733,"If this is what you were saying I would agree with that which is that on our mind too, when the police departments go for such training sessions, I don't imagine that as informally going as individuals they will be going there in some shape or form representing the Department and as Greg said in their uniform or I don't know what the phrasing is, but basically representing the Department in some shape or form.",167,,
1136,0.97,8174.733,8185.81,"As far as the question of what police officers do in informally, Yeah, this legislation is not going to address all the wrong doing informally on their own time in plain clothes.",167,,
1137,0.97,8185.81,8190.815,Seattle police officers went to the Capitol to participate in far right riots.,167,,
1138,0.97,8190.815,8196.221,"So yes, we will need an elected community oversight that is why we are arguing for that.",167,,
1139,0.97,8196.221,8217.809,"But this is specifically about what we have observed which is SPD officers going for legitimately sanctioned, legally sanctioned training sessions with nation States or agencies of nation States that have violated internationally recognized standards of human rights.",167,,
1140,0.97,8217.809,8220.378,Thank you.,168,,
1141,0.97,8220.378,8223.848,Council member Morales.,168,,
1142,0.97,8223.848,8224.482,"Um, thank you.",169,,
1143,0.97,8224.482,8230.922,So I may have just stopped myself out of my question.,169,,
1144,0.97,8230.922,8237.195,I was interested in what kinds of Trainings we might be talking about.,169,,
1145,0.97,8237.195,8247.706,Obviously there are the Militarized--Trainings to learn tactical things that I will say right now that I object to that.,169,,
1146,0.97,8247.706,8269.561,One of the things you mentioned is the language is broad and could potentially prohibit collaboration and best practices.,169,,
1147,0.97,8269.561,8283.541,Even if the Department is sending officers for what may be presumed best practice it still seems counter to what we as a human rights city would be wanting to support.,169,,
1148,0.97,8283.541,8297.188,But do you have specific examples of what outside of sort of tactical training they might be going to participate in?,169,,
1149,0.97,8297.188,8299.891,Ann and I talked with SPD last week.,170,,
1150,0.97,8299.891,8304.529,We asked them about examples of Trainings or conversations they've had with countries recently.,170,,
1151,0.97,8304.529,8320.345,They said they had reached out to the UK and Sweden about some crowd control tactics that had been used in those countries around less lethal weapons.,170,,
1152,0.97,8320.345,8335.593,Ways to employ demonstration or crowd control without use of less lethal weapons Maybe that would be an example where they might not be able to collaborate with foreign countries.,170,,
1153,0.97,8335.593,8353.611,That might be the kind of collaboration that could happen that would be outside of military tactics or training if that's an example you're looking for Council member Morales.,170,,
1154,0.97,8353.611,8353.945,Thank you.,171,,
1155,0.97,8353.945,8354.245,Thank you.,171,,
1156,0.97,8354.245,8368.36,I think it would be useful to have some additional conversation after voting in committee before full Council on that issue.,171,,
1157,0.97,8368.36,8374.532,"Appreciate your raising it, council member Morales.",171,,
1158,0.97,8374.532,8395.887,So this is along the same lines as Council member Lewis and Morales' line of questioning which is sort of getting a better understanding of the type of activity we're looking to prohibit or otherwise restrict by the Seattle police Department.,172,,
1159,0.97,8395.887,8399.257,I do recall and perhaps Greg and Ann you can help me track this down.,172,,
1160,0.97,8399.257,8435.193,"I tried to do a quick search of my E-mail Enwas not successful in it tracking down then assistant chief Leslie Cordner's response to a statement of legislative intent that the Council supported I believe it was in 2018, that was sponsored by Council member Sawant that requested or maybe it was Council member O'Brien that requested a list of Trainings in this area.",172,,
1161,0.97,8435.193,8467.959,Again it's going to be outdated because if it I recall correctly that was produced to us in 2018 but it might be the most recent compilation of the kinds of Trainings that were related to the issue that we're discussing now.,172,,
1162,0.97,8467.959,8490.315,That inventory of training to refresh our memories on the kinds of Trainings that SPD was doing related to this particular issue that was this was being advocated for by many of the same activists that are engaged in this legislation as well.,172,,
1163,0.97,8490.315,8509.0,"And I do see for what it's worth, I do seem to recall that chief best's trip was paid for in part at least by the city of Seattle.",172,,
1164,0.97,8509.0,8509.467,Much appreciated.,173,,
1165,0.97,8509.467,8513.605,"Council member Lewis, I see your hand raised.",173,,
1166,0.97,8513.605,8528.82,"Yeah, I want to signal my interest for central staff based on this conversation particularly around the--it doesn't look like it would be affected from the list of countries in the memo that was distributed this morning.",174,,
1167,0.97,8528.82,8536.327,Because Sweden and the United Kingdom don't appear to be on it.,174,,
1168,0.97,8536.327,8558.616,I this Agood point is raised that there are a lot of questions particularly in Western Europe who have developed really effective and good practices around Deescalation and more peaceful method of crowd control that we would want SPD to avail itself of.,174,,
1169,0.97,8558.616,8579.671,As we do put together a definition of training making sure we don't inadvertently exclude seeking out best practices from other countries regarding Deescalation considering that there are a lot of police departments around the world that could teach us quite a bit about it.,174,,
1170,0.97,8579.671,8589.681,I don't know if that is going to be as relevant given the list of countries that I'm looking at that are included in the current legislation.,174,,
1171,0.97,8589.681,8592.383,"But, you know, you never know.",174,,
1172,0.97,8592.383,8592.817,Perfect Segue.,175,,
1173,0.97,8592.817,8631.155,"I think for the discussion of the amendments because how I chose to deal with this issue in the committee discussion was to create objective standards of human rights violations that were significantly high that even absent a more narrow definition of Trainings, exchanges and partnerships, um, it's hard to conceive of many of these countries having best practices that we would want to emulate.",175,,
1174,0.97,8631.155,8643.568,But I still recognize that there is--it is unknown whether or not either one of these amendments are going to pass and if there is appetite Fr more discussion around that item.,175,,
1175,0.97,8643.568,8655.279,So with that central staff can you move into the discussion of the two amendments before us?,175,,
1176,0.97,8655.279,8668.226,So amendment a simplifies the exclusion criteria for potential SPD partners across any of the.,176,,
1177,0.97,8668.226,8682.306,The current exclusion criteria reference a violation of one of those two treaties or the fourth Joe know have Geneva convention.,176,,
1178,0.97,8682.306,8687.979,A Nonpreliminary investigation or past finding by the International criminal court.,176,,
1179,0.97,8687.979,8693.184,And the Iccs work program and history are readily available Online.,176,,
1180,0.97,8693.184,8702.794,So that is something SPD staff would be able to check and know they are Compliant with the legislation.,176,,
1181,0.97,8702.794,8707.865,Bans all SPD training with foreign Militaries.,176,,
1182,0.97,8707.865,8709.333,Without the exclusion criteria?,177,,
1183,0.97,8709.333,8711.202,"Yes, correct.",178,,
1184,0.97,8711.202,8714.872,Thank you for the clarification.,178,,
1185,0.97,8714.872,8718.943,Amendment B adds App exclusion criteria.,178,,
1186,0.97,8718.943,8728.619,A documentation of a fourth Geneva convention violation by an international or Intergovernmental human rights organization.,178,,
1187,0.97,8728.619,8744.635,The current exclusion criteria requires that violation be documented by an international court or UN body so amendment B opens it up allowing more organizations to document a fourth Geneva convention violation.,178,,
1188,0.97,8744.635,8750.708,Which would exclude the Violator country from any kind of SPD partnership.,178,,
1189,0.97,8750.708,8755.346,Thank you so much for that description.,179,,
1190,0.97,8755.346,8769.16,So let's first get to the vote before the committee and then we can move into greater discussion around the amendment.,179,,
1191,0.97,8769.16,8773.731,I move Council bill 12041 today.,179,,
1192,0.97,8773.731,8776.267,Second.,180,,
1193,0.97,8776.267,8779.237,Thank you both.,181,,
1194,0.97,8779.237,8788.613,So amendment a is the potential amendment that Ann just went over first that is the amendment that I am sponsoring.,181,,
1195,0.97,8788.613,8793.117,I move amendment a as listed on the agenda.,181,,
1196,0.97,8793.117,8801.392,Is there a second for amendment a?,181,,
1197,0.97,8801.392,8801.826,Second.,182,,
1198,0.97,8801.826,8806.297,Thank you Council President Gonzalez.,183,,
1199,0.97,8806.297,8821.746,"So again as mentioned I'd like the goal with amendment a is Unamended this legislation conceivably could kin corporate, scoop up hundreds of countries.",183,,
1200,0.97,8821.746,8832.957,I want to make sure that the bill and the implementation and the enforcement of the bill is understandable and straightforward for SPD to be able to implement.,183,,
1201,0.97,8832.957,8853.177,My goals are verified criterion that are both based in the Foregrounding of human rights and are easy for staff to apply because having verifiable list is not only necessary for implementation it's necessary for enforcement.,183,,
1202,0.97,8853.177,8882.84,"This proposed amendment simplifies the proposed standards that would be used to exclude foreign police agencies and intelligence agencies and security agencies as training partners with SPD and doing so it establishes, again, easily verified criterion.",183,,
1203,0.97,8903.427,8919.71,If I'm understanding this right it bans all training with Militaries but may still allow training with other police departments or intelligence agencies or other actors; is that --,184,,
1204,0.97,8919.71,8929.854,As long as--there are no exclusion criteria for training with military.,185,,
1205,0.97,8929.854,8935.359,Spd will not train with any military in any country Irregardless of their human rights standards.,185,,
1206,0.97,8935.359,8949.84,"Which I appreciate, but what I'm trying to understand is there are other agencies in government that aren't Militaries that still engage in practices that violate human rights.",186,,
1207,0.97,8949.84,8985.476,So that's why the legislation is beyond just foreign police agencies but also includes intelligence agencies and security Servicens security Servicesover intelligence agencies that are triggered by the human rights criterion in the amendment.,187,,
1208,0.97,8985.476,8988.713,"The Trainings, exchanges, would be banned.",187,,
1209,0.97,8988.713,8996.854,For all three of those types of agencies.,187,,
1210,0.97,8996.854,9004.295,Council member Sawant.,187,,
1211,0.97,9004.295,9008.799,That's in the base legislation that clarification.,187,,
1212,0.97,9008.799,9028.786,"Just on the amendment and also on the questions that came up or the points that came up about we don't want to scoop up opportunities for best practices, of course I want to be clear as the legislation that absolutely.",187,,
1213,0.97,9028.786,9049.373,"We have no evidence whatsoever, zero evidence, actually, that the police Department in Seattle has made any effort to get educated on presuming we all have agreement on what best practices would constitute.",187,,
1214,0.97,9049.373,9052.41,Nonviolent Deescalation practices.,187,,
1215,0.97,9052.41,9061.185,All the evidence that has necessitated this legislation and why these activists have been pushing for this.,187,,
1216,0.97,9061.185,9079.503,Training sessions that have been sought by the police or engaged in by the police in whatever way have been towards repressive measures from countries that have wrong track record of using those repressive measures.,187,,
1217,0.97,9079.503,9099.123,"I think that on Council member Herbold's amendment, we--I appreciate the intent of the amendment but perhaps.",187,,
1218,0.97,9099.123,9109.2,It,187,,
1219,0.97,9111.902,9119.043,The civil and political rights.,188,,
1220,0.97,9119.043,9120.811,I.C.E.,188,,
1221,0.97,9120.811,9141.765,----country territories boundaries exist situation and the--by the International--of violation--B which is investigations of potential human rights violations within the--for territory boundary.,188,,
1222,0.97,9141.765,9149.974,"As we know human rights violations,--in the nation's boundaries but outside.",188,,
1223,0.97,9149.974,9171.162,The police--so under the--violations the military is occupying--would not qualify.,188,,
1224,0.97,9171.162,9175.699,That is our language reading of the amendment.,188,,
1225,0.97,9175.699,9178.736,It can be --,188,,
1226,0.97,9224.982,9252.743,"We were talking about, activities that are occurring in territories within the boundaries of, of countries, I believe--drafted this, this language, to be inclusive, I appreciate the concern you are raising.",189,,
1227,0.97,9252.743,9270.427,That we might want to replace the words territories with occupied territories with--we would love to hear from --,189,,
1228,0.97,9287.278,9296.153,-- investigation is always taking place within it geographically circumscribed area.,190,,
1229,0.97,9296.153,9303.093,It has a definite starting point.,190,,
1230,0.97,9303.093,9304.395,Icc investigator take a long time.,190,,
1231,0.97,9304.395,9314.138,Because they give themselves permission to investigate incidents that may have taken place over many many years.,190,,
1232,0.97,9314.138,9315.706,And over a broad geographical territory.,190,,
1233,0.97,9315.706,9329.853,"In the sense that we want an objective metric, the ICC Non- preliminary investigation seems to be one that will work, that has a wide Purview.",190,,
1234,0.97,9329.853,9337.428,The language was written to match what is available as an objective metric.,190,,
1235,0.97,9337.428,9356.113,We can certainly take another look at how the ICC mixed investigations.,190,,
1236,0.97,9356.113,9368.292,I think we wait until you look at it more.,191,,
1237,0.97,9368.292,9385.542,My goal is to ensure this is not targeting any particular country.,191,,
1238,0.97,9391.081,9403.56,I'm concerned if we insert occupied territory words will make Exclusions and lean more towards a country specific director.,191,,
1239,0.97,9403.56,9408.232,And I just ask one question?,192,,
1240,0.97,9408.232,9417.04,If they do want to address an elegant study off-line.,192,,
1241,0.97,9417.04,9425.749,I'm not sure how adding this language would have the effect you're saying.,192,,
1242,0.97,9425.749,9430.754,Exclude.,192,,
1243,0.97,9430.754,9431.822,It's additional.,192,,
1244,0.97,9431.822,9440.264,We don't see is adding this as precluding the process.,192,,
1245,0.97,9440.264,9445.669,I understand what you're saying.,192,,
1246,0.97,9445.669,9451.742,Future studies that take many years.,192,,
1247,0.97,9451.742,9452.943,They have a broad geographical scope.,192,,
1248,0.97,9452.943,9455.078,I don't see these precluding any of that in any way.,192,,
1249,0.97,9455.078,9456.947,I see a is a good thing.,192,,
1250,0.97,9456.947,9476.767,It actually makes for what is--to make sure it doesn't--in that sense I do bring this forward as an amendment to your--seeing it in that White,192,,
1251,0.97,9476.767,9479.97,I understand the question.,193,,
1252,0.97,9479.97,9492.916,I don't want right now to characterize how the International criminal court describes its own work.,193,,
1253,0.97,9492.916,9500.824,The current language is in alignment with how--describes its work.,193,,
1254,0.97,9500.824,9514.972,I would just want to go back and Revisit it to make sure the proposed new language does not add a nuance that is not present and how the ICC administers cases.,193,,
1255,0.97,9514.972,9525.949,"I originally raise my hand, I just want to add for everyone's consideration, international human rights administration and treaty law is more listening company.",193,,
1256,0.97,9525.949,9538.161,We have been hesitant to draw our own conclusions about what we think the treaty say what we think is included and excluded.,193,,
1257,0.97,9538.161,9553.744,"The few hear me being very careful in what I'm willing to commit to, it is because the context is very complex and outside most people's area of expertise.",193,,
1258,0.97,9553.744,9557.247,I apologize for that .?,193,,
1259,0.97,9557.247,9581.305,I do think it's worth noting and has worked with the city's OA are and that University of Washington to try and interpret the spirit that is well outside of central staff's expertise.,193,,
1260,0.97,9581.305,9583.206,We are doing the best we can.,193,,
1261,0.97,9583.206,9590.28,This work often makes experts out of people--so thank you so much.,194,,

1307,0.97,9824.414,9825.549,All because it is abstention.,221,,

1309,0.97,9825.849,9828.652,We can confirm that with the clerk who is on the line.,223,,
1310,0.97,9828.652,9835.525,My understanding is abstention's don't count as a divided report.,223,,
1311,0.97,9835.525,9840.43,Only --,223,,
1312,0.97,9840.43,9846.436,We will confirm that is the case but I am pretty sure that is what the city council rules tell us.,224,,
1313,0.97,9846.436,9852.275,There was not an opportunity to engage in conversation or make comments before we call the role.,224,,
1314,0.97,9852.275,9861.685,"If it is appropriate Madam chair, I would like to just make just some brief comments.",224,,
1315,0.97,9861.685,9861.918,Great.,224,,
1316,0.97,9861.918,9872.429,I am abstaining on this bill from now because I really think there are several moving pieces still related to the underlying legislation.,224,,
1317,0.97,9872.429,9886.109,I have heard several times during our conversation during committee there will be some more information and follow-up during the interim between now and counsel on September 20th.,224,,
1318,0.97,9886.109,9899.389,"I would like to have the benefit of understanding how those pieces are moving about within the context of the, the underlying bill before, before I, I make a decision on, as to whether I support, the, the bill or not.",224,,
1319,0.97,9899.389,9922.112,"I will say that I, I want to caution the counsel based on conversations I have had, with Stakeholders in this area particularly with members of the Jewish community about the language that we are using in advocating for or against this particular piece of legislation.",224,,
1320,0.97,9922.112,9948.071,I have heard multiple times now from members within the Jewish community given the Uprise in hate crimes in our Jewish community there are significant concerns about how language used in the counsel and advocating for this bill may be received by the Jewish community.,224,,
1321,0.97,9948.071,9963.987,"I think it is incumbent upon us whether you agree or disagree with the fundamental issues related to matters in the Middle East, I do thick it's important for us to be responsible and how, we are, we are speaking about the issues that we care about.",224,,
1322,0.97,9963.987,9969.793,So we are not creating division amongst our community here.,224,,
1323,0.97,9969.793,9979.836,"So that we are not exacerbating the sentiment of, anti-Semitism within our local Jewish communities.",224,,
1324,0.97,9979.836,9988.812,"I agree with the concepts that we should not be engaging as a city with, with countries who have verifiable significance of human rights violations.",224,,
1325,0.97,9988.812,9995.485,We do this often even in our own country where we engage in conversations related to boycotts.,224,,
1326,0.97,9995.485,10010.433,"Because of States positions on issues like immigration and on women's rights, and reproductive justice, Lgbtq writes, this is not unusual for the city to take a position.",224,,
1327,0.97,10010.433,10021.311,"Against another jurisdiction because of the poor track record on issues of human rights, civil rights, immigrant rights, women rights, I see this is consistent with that.",224,,
1328,0.97,10021.311,10034.023,I also want us in the course of engaging in this conversation being mindful of the impact this can and does create with our local Jewish community.,224,,
1329,0.97,10034.023,10043.967,I have heard directly from them how it impacts their safety and their feeling of belonging in our city.,224,,
1330,0.97,10043.967,10049.272,Thank you for the opportunity to explain my abstention.,224,,
1331,0.97,10049.272,10058.348,I also wanted to just end by saying the city clerk has confirmed with me abstention's does not count as a divided report.,224,,
1332,0.97,10058.348,10065.288,This bill can't go forward on the 20th of September now.,224,,
1333,0.97,10065.288,10066.189,Councilmember Alice.,225,,
1334,0.97,10066.189,10069.559,In Queue.,226,,

1336,0.97,10072.695,10076.566,Thank you for your remarks as well.,226,,
1337,0.97,10076.566,10088.111,I think we have all learned over the last year and a half communities are not monolithic.,226,,
1338,0.97,10088.111,10093.65,We have folks that have differences of opinion about all of the things we do at the counsel.,226,,
1339,0.97,10093.65,10094.784,This is certainly no different.,226,,
1340,0.97,10094.784,10097.153,As a member of the Jewish community this is something I support.,226,,
1341,0.97,10097.153,10106.596,"I just wanted to, folks to know I think it's important we know there are differences in all of our different communities.",226,,
1342,0.97,10106.596,10118.641,And communities across the country taken similar action to make sure they do not send local police to train with foreign Militaries and other foreign police departments.,226,,
1343,0.97,10118.641,10136.493,"Cities in North Carolina, Vermont, Massachusetts, agree local police departments should not be participating in exchange trips to learn, particularly to learn very often the kind of extreme Anti- terrorists active but you end up using to police the black and Brown committees.",226,,
1344,0.97,10136.493,10140.997,In my opinion that is the real matter here.,226,,
1345,0.97,10140.997,10161.784,We don't want the police report and coming back with tactics when we know there is already very often a abuse of power--so I know the bill is not focused necessarily on the use of public dollars.,226,,
1346,0.97,10161.784,10166.523,I do occur with the policy imperative--should not spend dollars to send our officers abroad.,226,,
1347,0.97,10166.523,10175.064,We all know we have incredible need here for service that supports our most honorable communities.,226,,
1348,0.97,10175.064,10182.772,"That said, the counsel has long--of human rights and dignity for everyone.",226,,
1349,0.97,10182.772,10188.978,Including somebody Referenced earlier the passage of resolutions that declared Seattle a human Wright city.,226,,
1350,0.97,10188.978,10208.331,"And as a former Seattle human rights Commission myself, I am really committed to passing a policy that moves us as a municipality toward actively ensuring and endorsing the rights that are set out in universal Declaration of human rights.",226,,
1351,0.97,10208.331,10213.836,The U.S. doesn't even follow some of those precepts.,226,,
1352,0.97,10213.836,10217.273,We don't abide by the economic justice elements.,226,,
1353,0.97,10217.273,10221.277,Of this declaration.,226,,
1354,0.97,10221.277,10241.064,"I thick it's important we acknowledge that and move towards the goal of protecting everyone's dignity and acknowledging the human rights of folks abroad and communities here, by ending participation in programs that lead to the Militarization of our police Department.",226,,
1355,0.97,10241.064,10244.934,I am happy to support this.,226,,
1356,0.97,10244.934,10254.577,And look forward to being able to do something in the future.,226,,

1362,0.97,10270.96,10279.469,"Council President Gonzales, I cannot vote for or against this legislation until we have a training definition.",229,,
1363,0.97,10279.469,10285.508,This substantially is a ordinance about training and protocols run training.,229,,
1364,0.97,10285.508,10291.714,I don't really see how I can pass judgment on it without knowing what the scope of what coverage is going to be.,229,,
1365,0.97,10291.714,10293.416,So that is my abstention today.,229,,

1374,0.97,10322.211,10322.845,No problem.,232,,
