179,0.97,1086.852,1101.467,"Again, I didn't want to dwell because I know that Debbie had her story and when it happened, it was horrific and we were all at the community center with the Mayor and chief of police and the officers involved.",34,,
180,0.97,1101.467,1110.075,"But, as we say, we like to say, when you have spaces like this, you have now made a sacred space.",34,,
181,0.97,1110.075,1112.311,"As DEB said, she will be tied to that.",34,,
182,0.97,1112.311,1114.146,I saw Shannon in the picture.,34,,

187,0.97,1128.794,1159.324,"But the Lake City folk and Chuck and Jenn and DEB and everyone at Lake City neighborhood alliance putting aside and talking about how we lost people but particularly what Jenn was saying, there are people that--hundreds of people showed up at the Lake City--in the summer, when the Mayor spoke, I spoke and the chief of police spoke and Constantine spoke.",34,,
188,0.97,1159.324,1161.86,"And, it doesn't happen a lot in Seattle.",34,,
189,0.97,1161.86,1182.781,We are not always in the end zone together but that day we were and people were crying and hugging each other and the family of the people that were shot and the bus driver were all there and it was so nice to just meet the daughters and the husband and the spouse and the wife and just talk to people and not make it political.,34,,
190,0.97,1182.781,1186.318,"So, that doesn't happen a lot in this job.",34,,

215,0.97,1303.368,1323.622,"So, what the legislation will do is authorize the director to accept the donation of the real property from the parks foundation, then we place the property rights under our jurisdiction to be used for the Memorial and lay off the property as Right-Of-Way.",40,,
216,0.97,1323.622,1327.859,"So, here is some pictures of the existing conditions.",40,,

327,0.97,1853.685,1856.688,I will Tim it over to Tim Croll.,84,,
328,0.97,1856.688,1865.763,This is the first step in a multistage process to transfer vacated land near the South service center to create this dog park in Georgetown.,84,,
329,0.97,1865.763,1869.133,This is the first step in the process.,84,,

334,0.97,1881.98,1887.018,All right.,85,,
335,0.97,1887.018,1898.663,"So, in summary, ultimately the goal is for city light to get a street vacation approved by the city council later this year for a property next to the South service center.",85,,
336,0.97,1898.663,1927.825,"As you know, any community--any Street request requires an offsetting public benefit and city lights plan is to propose the transfer much a piece of property to parks and Sdot to develop an off leash dog park and trail segment of the Georgetown South Park connection and help fund that as a public benefit.",85,,
337,0.97,1927.825,1932.83,"Today's action, though, is removing an encumbrances on the property prior to the transfer to parks and Sdot.",85,,
338,0.97,1932.83,1941.406,That is to grant SP partial transfer of jurisdiction for a storm drain on the property.,85,,
339,0.97,1941.406,1956.521,"So, more background, this is where the street vacation we hope it will happen, this is the South service center, if tuck follow my Cursor there, the big warehouse like building with the city light and neon sign near the West Seattle freeway and fourth as much new.",85,,
340,0.97,1956.521,1965.997,Down here by COSTCO there is a segment of presently unused street that we are hoping to get in the vacation.,85,,
341,0.97,1965.997,1970.301,"So, the public benefit would be occurring in Georgetown.",85,,
342,0.97,1970.301,1981.579,"So, here is the Georgetown neighborhood, here is Boeing field and Boeing and this segment here is a piece of city light presently unused city light property that we are looking to donate.",85,,
343,0.97,1981.579,1993.524,And the donation of that combined with other city light financial support would lead to development of the off leash trail area segment.,85,,
344,0.97,1993.524,2004.535,Here is an Sdot picture showing the overall South Park--Georgetown South Park connection and this segment would be more or less in the middle of all that.,85,,
345,0.97,2004.535,2004.736,Okay.,85,,
346,0.97,2004.736,2019.217,"So, what is going on on the property that we have to take care of, a 24-inch storm drain built in 2012, part of a joint city light clean up for the Duwamish River.",85,,
347,0.97,2019.217,2023.621,No rights were created at that time.,85,,
348,0.97,2023.621,2033.731,Typically we create in effect an easement but they are another Department so it's a partial transfer of jurisdiction to allow them access to maintain this piece of trucks.,85,,
349,0.97,2033.731,2038.236,But we are proposing to take care of it now.,85,,
350,0.97,2038.236,2045.276,"And the Timeline, the city attorney's office recommends that this be taken care of prior to the transfer to parks and Sdot.",85,,
351,0.97,2045.276,2052.884,Things can get more complicated if we try to create utility rights on parks property once it's parks property.,85,,
352,0.97,2052.884,2055.052,It's better to do that beforehand.,85,,
353,0.97,2055.052,2061.926,Then the future property transfers would be subject to the terms of this partial transfer of jurisdiction.,85,,
354,0.97,2061.926,2073.871,"And the big show, as Eric says, of the street vacation and the larger property transfer ordinance is expected to be in front of Council this coming summer.",85,,

420,0.97,2395.326,2410.875,It's not a full detailed plan of every aspect of our work but a framework to provide the community with essential water and waste services and the investments that we aim to make over the next six years.,107,,
421,0.97,2410.875,2418.482,The plan proposes a three-year rate path with additional Three- year forecast choice an important distinction to make.,107,,
422,0.97,2418.482,2437.034,"We couldn't possibly project out for an entire six years what all the kinds of contingencies and events that we may have to plan for but we are aiming to solidly create a commitment for the next three years and, is so, when we go to slide 2--thank you.",107,,
423,0.97,2437.034,2458.956,"The plan aims to be a community centered plan focusing on what is important to our community and our community's values of continuous, reliable service delivery, environmental Sustainability, greater equity and a responsibility to ensure that rates are as affordable as possible.",107,,
424,0.97,2458.956,2474.572,"We developed the plan based on input from the customer review panel that put in a great deal of work as well as community survey research and put from Spu employees, community members and key Stakeholders.",107,,
425,0.97,2474.572,2484.148,"Can we go to the next slide, please?",107,,

427,0.97,2484.448,2491.455,The plan focuses on several aspects of essential service delivery.,107,,
428,0.97,2491.455,2499.597,"So, it supports uninterrupted delivery of equitable essential services that are really the core of what we do.",107,,
429,0.97,2499.597,2517.281,"And as Council member Pedersen mentioned, it includes drinking water, sewer and drainage, solid waste, recycling and clean city evidence and then Capitol project delivery and infrastructure maintenance.",107,,
430,0.97,2517.281,2520.117,"So, it's a big portfolio of work.",107,,
431,0.97,2520.117,2529.026,Our services are often invisible to people and it's hard for them to see what they are supporting through their rates.,107,,
432,0.97,2529.026,2545.743,"Wet we were moved when we saw a poem written during Covid that really highlighted that the assurance that came from the rhythm of our essential service delivery, that our employees provide for.",107,,
433,0.97,2545.743,2556.32,"And, so, goes I'm using to, if you don't mind I read a line of poetry.",107,,
434,0.97,2556.32,2570.401,"In Herman poem called essential, Jordan Heath wrote in the Dayless days of quarantine, it's not the pale gray wisps and human Sunsets that let me know it's okay.",107,,
435,0.97,2570.401,2573.537,"It's the morning, Tuesday, when the blue bin rumbles.",107,,
436,0.97,2573.537,2594.191,"The rest of the poem makes you just want to weep with being a scene, our employees Sob seen as a new thing, for at least by the general public, certainly not by our civic leaders.",107,,
437,0.97,2594.191,2598.162,"So, our plan supports continuous improvement--may we go to the--no, stay here.",107,,
438,0.97,2598.162,2600.898,I got moved by the poem.,107,,
439,0.97,2600.898,2608.906,Our plan supports continuous improvement in the delivery of our services as we strive to be the best in class in customer assistance.,107,,
440,0.97,2608.906,2614.011,This is really a key issue for us.,107,,
441,0.97,2614.011,2616.513,That includes our customer service.,107,,
442,0.97,2616.513,2629.226,"For example, with our call center response satisfaction but customer assistance in the sense of helping our low income customers through expanding Dp enrollment and other kinds of financial assistance.",107,,
443,0.97,2629.226,2651.148,"It means to us ensuring reliability of service, things like our transfer station separations, fire Hydrant repair and meeting regulatory requirements which are critical in terms of the quality of our source waters, of the water we provide and also, you know, all of our testing and monitoring.",107,,
444,0.97,2651.148,2658.355,"May we go to the next slide, please?",107,,
445,0.97,2658.355,2659.023,Thank you.,108,,
446,0.97,2659.023,2669.867,"Our plan, we hope, helps to significantly grow Seattle Sustainability and resilience and centers on those most impacted.",108,,
447,0.97,2669.867,2680.511,"We mean by that, people and other species and planning for current and future generations.",108,,
448,0.97,2680.511,2696.66,"Our water responsibilities range from managing the pristine water sheds such as the one behind me that we manage, the cedar and Gulch drinking water sheds to ensuring the best water quality that we can in the Puget sound.",108,,
449,0.97,2696.66,2710.374,"Our employees and customers are stewards of a one water cycle, something that we call a one water Sickle and the industry is increasingly recognizing which values water in all its forms.",108,,
450,0.97,2710.374,2720.25,"So, our plan supports investments in that work which includes blue-green trucks and environmental restoration.",108,,
451,0.97,2720.25,2731.395,Examples of that work include water quality investments like the very large Canal water quality project that is under construction.,108,,
452,0.97,2731.395,2731.728,Our Hatchery.,108,,
453,0.97,2731.728,2735.132,"Green infrastructure in the city itself, tree planting.",108,,

455,0.97,2740.537,2760.424,"It includes water climate adaptation and our work around environmental justice which we are both investing in in Realtime but also that we are planning for for the future in significant ways through plans like our shape, our water initiative.",108,,
456,0.97,2760.424,2774.905,"Likewise our responsibility to provide Waste Management services allows us to be partners with residents and businesses for a greener life by supporting a circular economy that moves us to zero waste and reduced carbon, air and water pollution.",108,,
457,0.97,2774.905,2787.317,"This is a key kind of--when I talk about things like zero waste and all of the work that our community does, it highlights the Partnerd nature of the work that we have to do.",108,,
458,0.97,2787.317,2790.387,We can't do it as a utility alone.,108,,
459,0.97,2790.387,2800.697,This is something that we aim to try to figure out how to best partner with everybody in our community in all of our environmental work.,108,,
460,0.97,2800.697,2810.374,"Our plan supports a pivotal effort to move upstream, to address pollution through waste prevention and waste diversion.",108,,
461,0.97,2810.374,2824.388,"That includes things like reducing food waste, the use of single use plastics and significant work to try to promote extended producer responsibility.",108,,
462,0.97,2824.388,2837.701,Trying to move upstream and not have our customers and community have to deal with poor decisions upstream with respect to the kinds of waste that they have to--paging and things that they have to manage.,108,,
463,0.97,2837.701,2839.937,It includes carbon mitigation.,108,,
464,0.97,2839.937,2844.675,We have done a lot to try to manage our carbon.,108,,
465,0.97,2844.675,2849.713,We have a lot more.,108,,

468,0.97,2872.135,2879.376,Our plan absolutely Prioritizes equity and empowerment both inside and outside of our organization.,108,,
469,0.97,2879.376,2908.105,This is part of our community center vision to put people at the heart of everything that we do and our plan supports that goal by making investments that seek to remove barriers to access such as the side sewer assistance pilot for low income folks and work trying to create services for unsheltered neighbors.,108,,
470,0.97,2908.105,2918.515,"It also includes creating greater opportunity within and into our organization, especially for under represented populations.",108,,
471,0.97,2918.515,2939.002,We have a concerted effort going on around apprentice ships and workforce development partnerships with community colleges and we have a long list of those kinds of efforts but you may be aware of our rain wise Academy and other kinds of programs that we have underway.,108,,

475,0.97,2947.177,2954.518,"I will go ahead and ask this but I'm happy to wait until the end of the presentation, thank you.",110,,
476,0.97,2954.518,2979.609,"In the previous slide you mentioned with regards to trying to prevent waste upstream, I know it's a huge issue trying to deal with the plastic packaging that we get and that is making me wonder what we could do as a city in working with businesses on not just plastic film and other items.",110,,
477,0.97,2979.609,2986.45,"I know we have in the past, you know, eliminated Styrofoam and those types of things.",110,,
478,0.97,2986.45,2999.996,Are their issues or things that you are working on already to try to get some of that waste packaging out of the system?,110,,
479,0.97,2999.996,3000.897,"Yes, absolutely.",111,,
480,0.97,3000.897,3018.949,"Our staff works very hard on the political--national, political side trying to push extended producer responsibility in packaging and also the use of Contaminants of concern in different kinds of products, right?",111,,
481,0.97,3018.949,3022.586,"Different forms of pollution, not just the physical stuff that you see.",111,,
482,0.97,3022.586,3026.523,More dangerous is the invisible stuff that you don't see.,111,,
483,0.97,3026.523,3039.736,"And, so, they work in terms of advancing legislation, producer education, coalition building by communities across the country.",111,,
484,0.97,3039.736,3062.659,"And trying to figure out what is the--what are the right systems of carrots and sticks in order to try to get manufacturers to reduce the amount of negative external its that us around the country have to manage and consumers, right.",111,,
485,0.97,3062.659,3077.441,A lot of the work that we do is managing the host of negative Externalities that come across industry and consumption.,111,,

493,0.97,3104.801,3106.77,I apologize to your team for having to deal with that.,112,,
494,0.97,3106.77,3108.538,We are trying to stop dealing with that.,112,,
495,0.97,3108.538,3113.61,There is a lot of waste out there.,112,,
496,0.97,3113.61,3120.317,It's Hashed to avoid it because of the upstream decisions that are being made as you said,112,,
497,0.97,3120.317,3169.733,"I--I like the convenience of that service if I may make a pitch for a way to save families money on the management of those kinds of products, Seattle public utilities has an approach where now you can just put every kind of--that kind of mysterious waste that you don't want to put into the regular recycling or waste stream, batteries, those kind of things, you can put it all into a box and there is a size--a designated size, Eub8G it's 2 by 2 by 2 and then we will come and get that box for a fee that is much less than Ridwell.",113,,
498,0.97,3169.733,3171.835,"Good to know, thank you",114,,
499,0.97,3171.835,3173.537,Of course.,115,,

501,0.97,3176.573,3184.414,"It's not as cute as the Ridwell box but a cardboard box is less, good thing",115,,
502,0.97,3184.414,3191.421,Appreciate it.,116,,
503,0.97,3191.421,3193.123,Thank you.,116,,

505,0.97,3195.892,3200.263,Are we on slide 6?,118,,
506,0.97,3200.263,3200.664,Afford ability,119,,
507,0.97,3200.664,3201.498,Great.,120,,
508,0.97,3201.498,3209.072,"I just want to make sure that--yes, okay.",120,,
509,0.97,3209.072,3226.423,"Our plan manages Affordability by lowering our rate path while meeting regulatory requirements, managing inflation, approving Affordability to customers and I will cover our customer assistance programs at the end of this presentation.",120,,
510,0.97,3226.423,3248.545,"But for now, some specific ways that we are actively working to lower rates and to address both Affordability and accountability and strengthen our utility practices include our capital project budgeting and delivery improvements.",120,,
511,0.97,3248.545,3268.965,I think that Councilmember Herbold will be happy to no we assume 85% accomplishment rate that saves our customers $200 million over six years and improves our cost confidence in our Capitol program and our performance tracking.,120,,
512,0.97,3268.965,3287.484,We are pursuing low interest loans such as Wifia funding for the ship Canal water quality project that will save the rate appears $60 million and we are continuing to advocate for greater Federal funding beyond the funding that we have already achieved for that project.,120,,
513,0.97,3287.484,3294.524,We aim to try to get funding for other project as well.,120,,
514,0.97,3294.524,3307.27,And we are investing in long- term seismic Resissians and addressing aging infrastructure through the asset management programs and opportunity work that arises in partnership with other departments.,120,,
515,0.97,3307.27,3315.912,We also understand that a key aspects of managing Affordability is developing strong partnerships with our community.,120,,
516,0.97,3315.912,3336.499,"You know, with residents and businesses through trying to engage them and making individual choices and efforts that reduce land filling, water quality, pollution and help us to capture Rainwater among the many other things like managing fats, oil and grease.",120,,
517,0.97,3336.499,3343.74,There is many other things that we can partner on to reduce our cost,120,,
518,0.97,3343.74,3344.541,"Thank you, general manager.",121,,
519,0.97,3344.541,3349.045,I wanted to give a special thanks to you and your team.,121,,
520,0.97,3349.045,3371.634,"When I was elected and it looked like utilities was something that I was interested in working on and you and I met and we got right to a discussion on afford ability and as the city has been facing an Affordability crisis and recognizing that everybody has to pay these bills, by their nature they are Regressive.",121,,
521,0.97,3371.634,3377.807,Lower income household will be paying a greater proportion of the household income to pay these bills.,121,,
522,0.97,3377.807,3409.873,"So, goes you are--it was great that there was alignment in wanting to look at all sorts of different cost drivers and how they could be managed to keep rates low and looking at the previous promised rate path as a foundation of--is there a way to do better than that going forward and really just appreciate the dedication that it took to make that happen and this strategic plan which earned the endorsement of the customer review panel.",121,,
523,0.97,3409.873,3415.178,I want to thank you for all of your efforts and your team,121,,
524,0.97,3415.178,3427.59,And we would like to thank you and the other Council members who have been involved in this really arduous work of bending the rate path down.,122,,
525,0.97,3427.59,3440.637,It has been--it is a continuous dialogue and requires significant analysis and effort.,122,,
526,0.97,3440.637,3442.906,"And, so, thank you very much.",122,,
527,0.97,3442.906,3448.344,"Councilmember Herbold, thank you, you got the ball started.",123,,
528,0.97,3448.344,3448.645,Sure.,124,,
529,0.97,3448.645,3467.33,"I want to just give a shout out since you mentioned the concept of the completion rate as being a driver and it was a concept introduced in the late--the last strategic up days, business plan update.",124,,
530,0.97,3467.33,3470.8,I want to give a shot out to Peter Lindsay.,124,,
531,0.97,3470.8,3476.506,He is no longer with us on central staff.,124,,
532,0.97,3476.506,3483.746,He was the person who introduced that concept a few years back.,124,,
533,0.97,3483.746,3506.569,"I'm glad to see that you have been able to expand on its use without reducing the--by reducing the accomplishment rate, we are not saying we are going to have any less investment in our capital needs.",124,,
534,0.97,3506.569,3521.05,We are being realistic about what the experience is in actually bringing those projects home exactly according to our schedule.,124,,
535,0.97,3521.05,3539.636,"So, a good balance that strives to recognize what our Capitol goals are with--an understanding of how--having unrealistic expectations about those goals affects affordable rates.",124,,
536,0.97,3539.636,3544.841,Really appreciate that you have kind of taken this conversation to the next level,124,,
537,0.97,3544.841,3569.599,"In the intervening years we have been able to do substantial verification, you know, of the efficacy of this approach by looking at data from--kind of the pier, cities and programs Aned also looking at our historical data to understand if we were creating risk.",125,,
538,0.97,3569.599,3577.073,We feel relatively confident in this approach and we are excited to see how it works out.,125,,
539,0.97,3577.073,3581.811,"And I think that we can absolutely deliver, you know, this balance that you spoke of",125,,
540,0.97,3581.811,3608.905,"I really hope that we can carry over our--the lessons learned that we have with Seattle public utilities to some of our conversations with King County around wastewater capital investments as well because as chair Pedersen and I are too aware, that is a big Affordability driver over there",126,,
541,0.97,3608.905,3629.759,"I would like to thank you both for your many, many hours of work in this area and your stewardship of the impacts to Seattle rate appears on these decisions that drive our rates because of those decisions.",127,,
542,0.97,3629.759,3635.431,Thank you very much.,127,,
543,0.97,3635.431,3641.871,We have been able to lower the six plan average rate path.,128,,
544,0.97,3641.871,3644.04,This slide goes into detail.,128,,
545,0.97,3644.04,3653.616,It shows our Strateg business plan proposed rate plan of 4.2% and how it's 20% lower than the previous plan growth rate of 5.2%.,128,,
546,0.97,3653.616,3659.188,You can see that through the dark line at the top and the Red line below it.,128,,
547,0.97,3659.188,3666.763,And we have lowered our rate proposal while significantly increasing customer financial assistance.,128,,
548,0.97,3666.763,3682.545,And some of the ways that we have done that is through self enrollment which is a much lower barrier approach than has been previously used.,128,,
549,0.97,3682.545,3697.693,"Increased emergency assistance donation, opportunities, payment flexibility and improved an aggressive method of reaching customers which has absolutely enhanced, I think, our impact--in this work during the pandemic.",128,,
550,0.97,3697.693,3707.07,To address inflationary pressures and continue to meet current and future utility challenges and obligations such as our regulatory requirements and taxes.,128,,
551,0.97,3707.07,3710.606,We have to--as modestly as possible raise rates.,128,,
552,0.97,3710.606,3714.477,It is something that we have to do.,128,,
553,0.97,3714.477,3728.057,"The and this slide shows our rate proposal compared to Cbos, projected 2.6% inflationary benchmark.",128,,
554,0.97,3728.057,3748.444,"And I want to note that what drives our rate of inflation as a utility is different than the 2.6% is based on, closer to the consumer price index.",128,,
555,0.97,3748.444,3757.153,The things that we pie Dutch buy can be significantly higher.,128,,
556,0.97,3757.153,3765.528,Sometimes as high as--in terms of year after year growth of 5% in this current market.,128,,
557,0.97,3765.528,3776.205,"So, it is very difficult close to CIP.",128,,
558,0.97,3776.205,3796.392,Part of the Affordability practice requires achieving balanced rate growth and avoiding precarious future rate spikes and deferment of utility infrastructure replacement and long-term financial instability.,128,,
559,0.97,3796.392,3804.634,"So, those concerns are also balanced in terms of the rate increases.",128,,
560,0.97,3804.634,3826.122,"Still, though, emphasizing the things that we need to attend to, we are focused on lowering costs where we can, even in areas that are traditionally not considered to be something that can be moved very easily such as the cost of debt, the cost of contracts and even getting Federal funding.",128,,
561,0.97,3826.122,3835.498,"You know, we have had significant push in terms of advocacy and applications for Federal funding.",128,,
562,0.97,3835.498,3844.54,"So, I will go into more detail on our rate path.",129,,
563,0.97,3844.54,3853.149,This breaks our composite 4.2% into separate utility fund details and drivers.,129,,
564,0.97,3853.149,3866.495,"Our waterline of business, the six-year rate path is proposed at an annual growth of 3.4%, which is just above standard inflationary levels.",129,,
565,0.97,3866.495,3878.14,And it increases our focus on targeted Capitol investment for maintaining and Seismically strengthening our water infrastructure.,129,,
566,0.97,3878.14,3890.152,The waterline business is aiming to be as close as it can to CIP while making sure we manage the risks.,129,,
567,0.97,3890.152,3908.17,"Solid Waistline increases proposed 2.4% average, below anticipated inflationary levels with contract payments and Remediating historic landfill in the South Park neighborhood being the most significant rate drivers for this line of business.",129,,
568,0.97,3908.17,3926.389,But you can see by looking at the two middle lines on this chart that the impact of regulatory compliance on our drainage and wastewater rate path can't be under estimated.,129,,
569,0.97,3926.389,3944.173,"And along with this, are the unplanned rate increases associated with King County wastewater treatment contract which has resulted in higher than inflation rate increases as well as not desired year to year variability.",129,,
570,0.97,3944.173,3974.603,"Our--just to get more--more detail on the regulatory compliance, the ship Canal water project, the largest Capitol project under taken by the city of Seattle is just one example of the many projects that are mandated by our consent decree, by combined sewer overflow decree to clean up a legacy of past pollution emitted into the waterways.",129,,
571,0.97,3974.603,4022.218,"So, given that he must comply, we are working to extract the utmost community value from the mandated drainage and wastewater expenditures and trying to do that by planning, you know, having a road map for how we will do that from community partnerships and both of those, you can see in our shape our water planning which I hope that you engage with--it would be great to have you and your staff's voices included and also participating in national conversations to ensure that our regulatory solutions are not unfunded mandates.",129,,
572,0.97,4022.218,4049.578,"That regulation is well aligned with community and environmental needs and to--part of our work is to emphasize nature based and climate adopted solutions such as green infrastructure and as we do our work, we aim to focus on the greatest need and the equity benefits to our local community.",129,,
573,0.97,4049.578,4049.912,Thank you.,130,,
574,0.97,4049.912,4062.191,"I W57B9D to echo a point Councilmember Herbold made on the wastewater line in the previous slide, one of the reasons it's high is a decision made by King County Council.",130,,
575,0.97,4062.191,4071.033,King County Council ultimately decides a portion of that rate that is passed directly to Seattle rate payers.,130,,
576,0.97,4071.033,4077.84,There is a concern about the age of all the assets in the system.,130,,
577,0.97,4077.84,4097.827,At the same time we are hoping that King County will be mindful of that rate being passed directly to Seattle rate payers to manage their costs as well as you are managing your costs so that our rate payers are not negatively impacted bypass through rates.,130,,
578,0.97,4097.827,4110.206,We will continue discussions with King County Council if there is a way to strict a balance with taking care of asset management and mitigating the other cost drivers coming from King County.,130,,
579,0.97,4110.206,4111.941,Maybe there are other sources of revenues.,130,,
580,0.97,4111.941,4117.346,There is a lot of real estate development happening in rural and suburban areas.,130,,
581,0.97,4117.346,4124.553,We want to make growth pay for growth in those areas especially.,130,,
582,0.97,4124.553,4134.396,"So, there is lots of discussion to be happening so we will continue talking to King County Council on those costs being passed through",130,,
583,0.97,4134.396,4136.899,Thank you so much.,131,,
584,0.97,4136.899,4153.616,It's wonderful to have Council members that advocate and are knowledgeable about these important issues that directly impact the bottom line for our customers.,131,,
585,0.97,4153.616,4154.517,"So, thank you very much.",131,,
586,0.97,4154.517,4160.789,"So, we are going to talk a little bit about what is driving the rates.",131,,
587,0.97,4160.789,4163.425,"I mentioned some of these things already, right?",131,,
588,0.97,4163.425,4176.872,"You can think of our rate drivers in three main categories, inflation, operational expenses like labor and health care.",131,,
589,0.97,4176.872,4185.381,Also regulatory compliance and our capital program and also coupled with the need to replace aging infrastructure.,131,,
590,0.97,4185.381,4200.663,And then Lastly the last category is increased costs associated with required contracts such as the King County treatment services contract that we have.,131,,
591,0.97,4200.663,4214.31,And this pie chart shows how much Seattle public utilities will spend proportionately the next three years on the largest drivers of cost.,131,,
592,0.97,4214.31,4221.483,And it reflects the aggregate anticipated spending for all three of our funds.,131,,
593,0.97,4221.483,4246.442,"You can see, if you look at the detail, even though the overall budget is large, much of it is based on fixed expenses, contracts, regulatory requirements, taxes or growing beyond the influence of the utility and typical inflationary rates such as construction materials and health care.",131,,
594,0.97,4246.442,4269.732,"You can see that from the just to highlight the operations and maintenance component of our work, the gray area is just a very small percentage of the over all budget.",132,,
595,0.97,4269.732,4277.506,"When we mention taxes, we wanted to give you more detail what does that look like for each line of business.",132,,
596,0.97,4277.506,4293.589,This shows the breath of the different taxes that the utility and its rate payers pay from city to state taxes N.,132,,
597,0.97,4293.589,4307.369,2021 we anticipate paying 123 million in city taxes and an additional amount in state taxes.,132,,
598,0.97,4307.369,4343.906,"Thank you, I asked about utility taxes previously so it's a concept that sometimes gets lost in the Minutia, the budgeting process but the utility tax is something that basically the city government charges Spu and I think the state government has a cap on how much can they charge to Seattle city light but there is no cap on what can be charged to the different lines of business from Spu.",133,,
599,0.97,4343.906,4347.81,There is a small amount to Cabling operators.,133,,
600,0.97,4347.81,4349.511,I was doing calculations.,133,,
601,0.97,4349.511,4389.251,"It looks like from Spu, maybe this is a different slide but I think it's about $100 million a year taken from Sbu budget and moved to the rest of the city budget for Goodpurposes but something that is a cost driver, something that--to put it out there that because utility rates are aggressive, the more we increase utility taxes, it's a pass through to utility customers and increasing a Regressive fee on rate payers.",133,,
602,0.97,4389.251,4406.835,"So, being mindful of this and intentional about how we treat this utility tax, it does have an impact on Seattle residents residents, something to be careful how it's used.",133,,
603,0.97,4406.835,4408.437,There is no free lunch.,133,,
604,0.97,4408.437,4418.18,"If we increase utility taxes to get something for the general Fund, we are passing that fee, Regressive fee to rate payers.",133,,
605,0.97,4418.18,4431.393,I think Brian goodnight will do a memo to analyze the whole strategic plan and I hope it touches on the utility taxes a bit for those who aren't as familiar with it.,133,,
606,0.97,4431.393,4432.461,Thank you.,134,,
607,0.97,4432.461,4444.439,"The specific number this year for the city taxes, not including the state taxes else 123 million",134,,
608,0.97,4444.439,4445.207,Thank you.,135,,
609,0.97,4445.207,4445.974,Sure.,136,,
610,0.97,4445.974,4446.275,Thank you.,136,,
611,0.97,4446.275,4458.32,"So, we will go to the next slide on customer bill impacts because percentages of increase, you know, are somewhat I lieu safe.",136,,
612,0.97,4458.32,4465.761,We want to make sure that it's concrete what the impact is to people's pocketbooks and Wallets.,136,,
613,0.97,4465.761,4472.634,This slide shows the changes to customer bills over the rate path period.,136,,
614,0.97,4472.634,4480.442,It's based on a typical bill for a few different categories of customers.,136,,
615,0.97,4480.442,4494.756,"So, for example, if you look at for 2021, a single family home will see a monthly charge of about--the following year, a monthly charge of about $15 more a month.",136,,
616,0.97,4494.756,4512.708,"Multifamily unit, a change of about $4 a month and a small business like a convenience store will see a monthly change of $38 a month.",136,,
617,0.97,4512.708,4521.483,"So, where does the money go for--from the customers' perspective?",136,,
618,0.97,4521.483,4527.422,"This shows a typical family house, monthly bill is and what their bill pays for.",136,,
619,0.97,4527.422,4559.621,"So, you can see that they are also helping--this is giving you the kind of dollar breakdown of what they would be contributing to, the Capitol program to King County treatment costs and the solid waste contracts, taxes and then what they are paying with respect to Seattle public utilities operation and maintenance which is about a quarter of all of that.",136,,
620,0.97,4559.621,4570.299,This is to discuss it in more detail this issue of the lower accomplishment rate assumptions.,136,,
621,0.97,4570.299,4580.609,I wanted to highlight just one aspect of the work that we did to bring down the overall rate by talking about this accomplishment rate.,136,,
622,0.97,4580.609,4585.981,"As everyone has heard, we used to assume 100% accomplishment rate.",136,,
623,0.97,4585.981,4597.059,And we would budget for that amount and set rates in order to support that amount to collect the revenue needed to support 100% accomplishment rate.,136,,
624,0.97,4597.059,4606.935,During the chief business plan effort we received guidance from Councilmember Herbold to a realistic level.,136,,
625,0.97,4606.935,4608.704,We thought it would be difficult 97 1/2 percent.,136,,
626,0.97,4608.704,4612.074,That was a lot of work by the Councilmember.,136,,
627,0.97,4612.074,4630.425,"But as I said before, goes we did a lot of analysis and we also looked at industry standards and practices and our proposed plan is to lower it to 85% to 90% depending on the--on the area.",136,,
628,0.97,4630.425,4643.105,And we have estimated that this lower assumption will save rate payers approximately 222 million over the rate period in potential cost avoidance.,136,,
629,0.97,4643.105,4648.543,"So, we can pass that, goes that savings on, through the rates.",136,,
630,0.97,4648.543,4656.518,So now we can talk about something that I know is very important to all of you.,136,,
631,0.97,4656.518,4663.425,The all of you have been advocates for Affordability for low income customers.,136,,
632,0.97,4663.425,4678.907,"And, so, I just want to--so I rest on this issue a bit about how do we--what are we doing to make sure that we do well in this area.",136,,
633,0.97,4678.907,4684.446,We are ensuring equitable access is a priority across the utility.,136,,
634,0.97,4684.446,4696.525,"And we are providing significant support through the programs on the slide, especially--that are especially important during this difficult time for everyone.",136,,
635,0.97,4696.525,4698.16,Spu's financial assistance is about 22 million per year.,136,,
636,0.97,4698.16,4704.499,One of the most generous in the country.,136,,
637,0.97,4704.499,4718.58,"And with Covid payment deferrals included, that brings our kind of--the--our assistance over all to the range of about $35 million.",136,,
638,0.97,4718.58,4725.821,"In 2020, we increased enrollment by over 4,500 customers.",136,,
639,0.97,4725.821,4738.734,"And through our business plan, we will continue to seek ways to lower both the rate increases and to ensure Affordability assistance.",136,,
640,0.97,4738.734,4750.512,"So, you know, the ways that we provide assistance are also expanding.",136,,
641,0.97,4750.512,4766.528,"That includes focusing on side sewer assistance, helping unsheltered neighbors and also looking for ways to fund our programs that we have not previously tapped into.",136,,
642,0.97,4766.528,4790.886,"And as I mentioned before, the ultimate goal is to build a partnership with everyone that we serve to find out--to find and achieve the most seasonal balance for the economic impact of our work as well as Sustainability of our infrastructure, public health and the environment that we all share.",136,,
643,0.97,4790.886,4805.333,"So it's important for us to continually find ways to partner with and to continue to rely on our customers to do their part in keeping environmental costs low by conserving, minimizing pollution and reducing up Cycling waste.",136,,
644,0.97,4805.333,4816.411,"So, all of that helps us to deliver the best quality service that we can apt the lowest possible predictable rate.",136,,
645,0.97,4816.411,4819.748,And that is it for the presentation component of the discussion.,136,,
646,0.97,4819.748,4825.487,We are happy to take any questions at all.,136,,
647,0.97,4825.487,4830.125,"Councilmembers, as I mentioned, there will be three committee meetings.",137,,
648,0.97,4830.125,4830.592,These the first.,137,,
649,0.97,4830.592,4848.944,Next one we will hear from central staff who will take any questions and expand on the answers in the memo and then the third committee meeting we will vote on the resolution.,137,,
650,0.97,4848.944,4858.253,Happy to take questions while we have general manager Herra and her team here.,137,,
651,0.97,4858.253,4861.056,Councilmember Herbold,137,,
652,0.97,4861.056,4883.511,"Reflecting again on the Council resolution that adapted the last strategic business plan, in the resolution, one of the things that we Playinged is the need to revise the water connection charge calculation methodology.",138,,
653,0.97,4883.511,4935.33,"And I--my recollection is the water connection charge calculation was updated and that was that element was fulfilled but the other request was to develop an implementation plan for sewage and drainage connection charges as well 6789 these are system development charges, sort of like impact fees for utilities in the infrastructure necessary to include utilities in new buildings and I know that Spu did a lot of work in developing for the sewer and drainage connection fees.",138,,
654,0.97,4935.33,4948.476,"We are one of the only jurisdictions--my recommend election, one of the only jurisdictions in the state that don't value sewer and drainage connection charges.",138,,
655,0.97,4948.476,4951.279,There is a King County charge.,138,,
656,0.97,4951.279,4960.755,But many other cities within King County have a County and a city charge.,138,,
657,0.97,4960.755,4987.048,This is another way of incurring that rates are low and this is an issue that has been flagged by the review panel in previous years and I'm just wondering all the work that public utilities put into the development of options and just wondering where that might be now?,138,,
658,0.97,4987.048,4991.653,Thank you for bringing up that topic.,139,,
659,0.97,4991.653,5017.645,"You know, the point of such connection service charges is that new development then pays for--helps to pay for the investment, their fair share of the investments that have already been made in the existing infrastructure of the city, you know, rather than the previous investors who paid for it, to bear the full cost.",139,,
660,0.97,5017.645,5024.285,It's allowing for growth to pay for its fair share.,139,,
661,0.97,5024.285,5070.465,"And the main concern for many parties is that if the cost of development increases in Seattle, that there would be further Inhi Bishop of development, residential development, much needed housing for folks so, goes there is pressure for, you know, on all kinds of potential charges to be withheld in order to promote the best rate of housing development in Seattle as possible.",139,,
662,0.97,5070.465,5096.124,"I believe you worked to develop that allowed for additional, I believe, far for housing providers, particularly housing providers that get a benefit in exchange for the development charge to make it cost neutral.",140,,
663,0.97,5096.124,5113.007,"So, my recollection is that the direction was to develop a system development charge proposal that minimized the negative cost impacts to the development of affordable housing.",140,,
664,0.97,5113.007,5120.148,I can--I can talk more about this with chair Pedersen and with yourself off line.,140,,
665,0.97,5120.148,5126.888,But I wanted to flag that it was a continuing interest of mine,140,,
666,0.97,5126.888,5135.597,Thank you for your interest in advocacy of this area of work.,141,,
667,0.97,5135.597,5138.166,We stand ready with analyses and the ability to implement,141,,
668,0.97,5138.166,5140.969,Thank you for raising that.,142,,
669,0.97,5140.969,5154.115,I also share an interest in that and I think the Covid pandemic delayed things on so many different fronts.,142,,
670,0.97,5154.115,5211.406,"Council members, any other questions in our first I want to thank all the work that's been put into this, and we'll keep digging into it before our next committee meeting as well.",143,,
671,0.97,5211.406,5212.006,So thank you to your team.,143,,
672,0.97,5212.006,5224.752,"Thank you very much for your attention and shared stewardship on all the issues in the strategic business plan, to you and all the other Council members.",144,,
673,0.97,5224.752,5226.754,Thank you.,145,,
674,0.97,5226.754,5228.056,"Thank you, Paula.",145,,
675,0.97,5228.056,5230.358,Nice to see you.,145,,
676,0.97,5230.358,5230.658,"Hi, Bob.",145,,
677,0.97,5230.658,5251.512,Will the clerk read the next agenda item into the record.,145,,
678,0.97,5256.618,5260.989,The 2021 technology matching fund report presentation.,146,,
679,0.97,5260.989,5262.29,Thank you.,147,,
680,0.97,5262.29,5277.972,"As we strive to expand access to the Internet throughout Seattle, our technology matching fund continues as a cornerstone of our efforts to connect all city residents to jobs and education and vital services.",147,,
681,0.97,5277.972,5287.282,"Our technology Department is here to talk about the technology matching fund, so welcome.",147,,
682,0.97,5287.282,5288.182,"Thank you, council member Peterson.",148,,
683,0.97,5288.182,5289.217,Good morning to everyone else on the committee.,148,,
684,0.97,5289.217,5307.101,I'm going to say a couple things and pass it onto my colleagues Tracy and Vicky.,148,,
685,0.97,5307.101,5312.807,We take pride in calling it a good day.,148,,
686,0.97,5312.807,5320.148,But we have been making a show in terms of what Seattle it has been up to in terms offer Digital equity.,148,,
687,0.97,5320.148,5339.1,"Vicky is going to talk about the recipients for this year's grant and may talk about the improvements we have made in terms of how quickly we were able to process these applications, which was a Dirct result of the feedback we were getting from the community.",148,,
688,0.97,5339.1,5349.043,"Today it's really just one of a few things that the Digital equity team with the city does, including helping with Broadband.",148,,
689,0.97,5349.043,5378.573,"And the last thing I would mention, a Shoutout to a number of different departments that have come together for the last several months, led by Seattle it as well as the office of refugees to talk about some really good thinking that's emerging, and I'm sure one of these days city council will be hearing about it as well.",148,,
690,0.97,5378.573,5384.178,"Vicky, take it away.",148,,
691,0.97,5384.178,5389.484,Thank you.,148,,
692,0.97,5389.484,5390.118,Great.,149,,
693,0.97,5390.118,5390.418,Thank you.,149,,
694,0.97,5390.418,5393.287,We appreciate this opportunity to share with the Council.,149,,
695,0.97,5393.287,5416.31,"This is something we have done since 1997 and it's exciting to share all the efforts that went into making this a reality this year, especially in the challenge of making everything remote.",149,,
696,0.97,5416.31,5426.888,"To those who may not know, we have put about $6 million in awards to 265 Community-Based organization projects.",149,,
697,0.97,5426.888,5434.095,The wonderful thing about the Tech matching fund is that they are Community-Driven efforts.,149,,
698,0.97,5434.095,5448.309,The community themselves come up with ideas of projects they would like to see implemented in their geographic areas or among surgeon populations or demographics.,149,,
699,0.97,5448.309,5453.548,"The $6 million has generated $9 million in community match, which is amazing.",149,,
700,0.97,5453.548,5463.558,That just goes to show the heart that goes into the heart and hard work that goes into making these projects successful.,149,,
701,0.97,5463.558,5468.529,So we can move on to the next slide.,149,,
702,0.97,5468.529,5473.501,Thank you for driving.,149,,
703,0.97,5473.501,5474.635,Appreciate it.,149,,
704,0.97,5474.635,5489.283,"This year's technology fund matching awards, we had $320,000 available to award.",149,,
705,0.97,5489.283,5501.629,On the Website at Seattle.Gov you can actually go to the map and hit on the points and be able to see what these points actually connect to.,149,,
706,0.97,5501.629,5509.804,So you can see they cover most all of Seattle.,149,,
707,0.97,5509.804,5516.878,"While the project locations are noted, these are where they are actual located.",149,,
708,0.97,5516.878,5521.015,Many of the programs serve areas they are not even located in.,149,,
709,0.97,5521.015,5531.459,So this is a great opportunity to to show how they partner with different organizations in different areas to make these projects happen.,149,,
710,0.97,5531.459,5541.836,"Next slide, please.",149,,
711,0.97,5555.216,5556.751,I wanted to share a little bit more about this year's process.,149,,
712,0.97,5556.751,5567.395,"We did have 55 applicants that were--that applied for the Tech matching fund, totaling $1.2 million in asks.",149,,
713,0.97,5567.395,5570.031,"We had $320,000 to provide.",149,,
714,0.97,5570.031,5590.451,"And while we had 55 applications, we had a review panel of 19 folks from the community, from our community technology advisory board, which plays a huge role in ensuring that we have great representation in terms of the people reviewing the applications.",149,,
715,0.97,5590.451,5604.498,"The application reviewers all go through unconscious bias training, and so they have the opportunity to understand that many of these applications are not coming from large organizations with developmental departments.",149,,
716,0.97,5604.498,5620.648,They do come from community group and organizations who are able to really pull together and really demonstrate what it is that they are wanting to provide in their community.,149,,
717,0.97,5620.648,5624.352,"I'm sorry, I feel like there's a slide missing.",149,,
718,0.97,5624.352,5628.756,"That's why my eyes are darting back and forth, so I apologize.",149,,
719,0.97,5628.756,5638.599,We did have 55 applicants and we were able to fund 14 of those.,149,,
720,0.97,5638.599,5657.818,"Also I wanted to Shoutout to the Verizon foundation who funded an additional coalition with $25,000.",149,,
721,0.97,5657.818,5667.161,"We feel like even though we could fund 14 applicants, we could have easily funded 30 of them.",149,,
722,0.97,5667.161,5685.312,"They were all ranked very high, and I've met to them to explain to them what it was about their application that maybe did not have advice, and excited for their future opportunities.",149,,
723,0.97,5685.312,5688.883,I want to touch on the Covid-19 response.,149,,
724,0.97,5688.883,5702.196,"You know, what we loved about this year is that there were so many applicants that really came up with creative solutions for Transitioning back to In- person instruction.",149,,
725,0.97,5702.196,5714.875,"While they are providing, coming in with ideas of projects in person, they will also be doing hybrid models themselves, similar to what you'll be seeing in schools.",149,,
726,0.97,5714.875,5725.686,So many have asked for cameras and such so that they could make their LABS more conducive to hybrid opportunities.,149,,
727,0.97,5725.686,5731.525,"Additionally, Legending libraries have been very popular.",149,,
728,0.97,5731.525,5745.039,We saw a real increase in the number of projects that wanted to do lending libraries because some folks at home don't have access to technology and device and such.,149,,
729,0.97,5745.039,5778.672,"But the exciting part was the implementation and request for Digital media equipment, different types of devices that could be lent out to folks in the community so they could be hands-on remotely.",149,,
730,0.97,5778.672,5783.911,There's also the encouraging model where people were adopting technology.,149,,
731,0.97,5783.911,5795.089,They could receive a device perhaps for training but may be able to keep that and continue using it in the future once their workshops and education program ended.,149,,
732,0.97,5795.089,5803.13,Also you wanted to share that there's a lot of support for Digital navigator services.,149,,
733,0.97,5803.13,5823.551,"For those who may not know what that is, there are folks in the community often working for Community-Based organizations that have diverted their regular work to walk folks through how to use their devices.",149,,
734,0.97,5823.551,5851.712,"This take place on zoom and if participants or a student doesn't understand how to participate virtually, these staff have had to kind of walk poem through that, and takes an enormous amount of time.",149,,
735,0.97,5851.712,5859.787,"We also have an increase in folks who want home Connectivity, so Digital navigators help get them signed up as well.",149,,
736,0.97,5859.787,5864.758,So I think this is the end of my presentation.,149,,
737,0.97,5864.758,5868.462,"If you have any questions, we are totally open for questions.",149,,
738,0.97,5868.462,5878.439,"Thank you very much, Vicky, and thanks to everybody who reviewed those applications and had to make those tough decisions.",150,,
739,0.97,5878.439,5887.348,"You know, we will be hearing from the technology Department in a couple weeks about the Internet for all action plan.",150,,
740,0.97,5887.348,5922.816,"And the number of applications you mentioned, only being a I believe to grant 15 of those as we consider how to invest funds from the government and new sources like the American rescue plan, we can be mindful of the Digital divide and look potentially at one option to go further down that list, since those applicants have already been screened: that's something we'll discuss as part of the Finance Committee discussions that are coming.",150,,
741,0.97,5922.816,5934.495,This is God to have this presentation as we are talking about Internet for all and thinking about the Arpa funding.,150,,
742,0.97,5934.495,5944.972,Any questions on the report on the technology matching fund?,150,,
743,0.97,5944.972,5945.172,Okay.,150,,
744,0.97,5945.172,5948.108,"Council member Gonzalez, please.",150,,
745,0.97,5948.108,5948.442,Thank you.,151,,
746,0.97,5948.442,5962.456,No questions about the report but I want to thank you all for continuing your important work in this space and in this sort of city effort to the address this issue.,151,,
747,0.97,5962.456,5980.374,I also wanted to make NOTE and appreciate Seattle it's involvement in the mass vaccination site efforts happening.,151,,
748,0.97,5980.374,6015.009,"I was surprised to hear the Seattle it has been providing at will of technical support in that operation, and I think really important for us to sort of improve the technology infrastructure and access to Internet outside of city hall, but to also be able to leverage or own resources, both in expertise and equipment to do this really important community work.",151,,
749,0.97,6015.009,6017.778,It's really just admirable.,151,,
750,0.97,6017.778,6032.726,"One of the ways I know you guys are supporting, they put all these Ipads at the site and there's On-Demand interpretation happening on the other side of the screen.",151,,
751,0.97,6032.726,6054.281,There's so much to make that mass vaccination site run smoothly and I want to make sure and appreciate all your staff doing tremendous work on that effort.,151,,
752,0.97,6057.017,6057.384,Thank you.,152,,
753,0.97,6057.384,6057.684,All right.,152,,
754,0.97,6057.684,6062.055,Eric from central staff is the point person on this issue and will have more in the next couple weeks.,152,,
755,0.97,6062.055,6064.091,"Thank you, everybody from it being here.",152,,
756,0.97,6064.091,6065.726,Good to see you.,152,,
757,0.97,6065.726,6071.198,"See you in a couple weeks, if not sooner.",152,,
758,0.97,6071.198,6074.701,We have more it stuff coming up though on this agenda.,152,,
759,0.97,6074.701,6086.713,So will the clerk read the title of the next agenda item into the record.,152,,
760,0.97,6086.713,6107.301,"An ordinance relating to surveillance technology implementation, authorizing approval of Useds and accepting the surveillance impact report for the Seattle police Department's use of 911 logging recorder technology, for briefing and possible vote.",153,,
761,0.97,6107.301,6108.202,Thank you.,154,,
762,0.97,6108.202,6115.909,There was a single bill introduced February 22nd and we heard it in the March 3RD and March 17th committee.,154,,
763,0.97,6115.909,6132.426,"We just broke it into five pieces, so those are the five bills.",154,,
764,0.97,6132.426,6151.845,"To implement the city's cutting edge ordinance, our existing technology and computer programs undergo an extensive review process by the executive departments of community led groups and other stake holders.",154,,
765,0.97,6151.845,6160.454,Some technology can also have surveillance capabilities or privacy concerns that need to be evaluated with surveillance impact reports.,154,,
766,0.97,6160.454,6167.227,Thanks to everybody for improving the reports for Seattle light and the Seattle fire department previously.,154,,
767,0.97,6167.227,6173.901,"Again, we took the existing police technology items and broke them into five bills.",154,,
768,0.97,6173.901,6181.508,"Because we have heard them twice already, the is to vote these bills out of committee today.",154,,
769,0.97,6181.508,6194.955,"We will, however, provide a little bit of extra runway for the full council deliberation on these, so instead of going straight to Council this coming Monday, it would skip a week and go the next Monday.",154,,
770,0.97,6194.955,6203.597,"So this is the first bill that was read into the record, which is the 911 logging recorder technology.",154,,
771,0.97,6203.597,6219.413,"I want to thank you members for getting their amendments in as well, allowing the city attorney's office to get them reviewed and on the agenda before us today.",154,,
772,0.97,6219.413,6243.103,"Thanks to everybody for your hard work on this, especially our central staff keeping it all together for us and the it Department and each Department as well.",154,,
773,0.97,6243.103,6243.67,"Lisa, opening remarks here?",154,,
774,0.97,6243.67,6247.474,I was going to check with you.,155,,
775,0.97,6247.474,6270.197,"I think I can walk through each item and introduce the bill briefly, and then walk through the amendments either one at a time or all them come back to each one.",155,,
776,0.97,6270.197,6279.306,I think mentioning them all at one time is fine because they are all very workable and I'm supportive of all of them.,156,,
777,0.97,6279.306,6282.609,"Hearing the big picture will be helpful, I think.",156,,
778,0.97,6282.609,6283.21,Okay.,157,,
779,0.97,6283.21,6302.796,"I'll go ahead and share my screen then, where I'll be able to show you the amendments as I'm speaking to them, if that works.",157,,
780,0.97,6302.796,6315.208,"Item eight, this would approve the police Department's continued use of its 911 logging recorder and accept the surveillance impact report and executive overview for that technology.",157,,
781,0.97,6315.208,6328.488,"As you have previously heard, the 911 logging recorder automatically records all calls to SPD's dispatch calls and all radio traffic between the Dispatchers and patrol officers.",157,,
782,0.97,6328.488,6345.038,"One amendment before the committee today, sponsored by Council member Peterson, requesting a report from the police Department on the Metrics to be used in the chief technology officer's annual equity assessments of this technology.",157,,

865,0.97,6884.21,6892.285,"Absolutely, thanks for the opportunity.",204,,
866,0.97,6892.285,6914.607,Basically the amendment requests that the police Department report on the feasibility of retaining records of nonspecific license plate reader data for no more than seven days.,204,,
867,0.97,6914.607,6919.746,Currently the data that SPD uses for enforcement is deleted after 90 days.,204,,
868,0.97,6919.746,6936.396,The amendment would ask them to report back to Council later this year on deleting that data after no more than seven days.,204,,
869,0.97,6936.396,6948.308,Overretention of data was identified as a problem area and recommended data retention be limited to affect the purpose defined.,204,,
870,0.97,6948.308,6957.016,So the amendment is intended to reflect this recommendation.,204,,
871,0.97,6957.016,6981.274,And I think I'll hold my question that was brought up in public comment until we're maybe done considering the amendments.,204,,
872,0.97,6989.115,6991.851,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",205,,
873,0.97,6991.851,6992.285,Any other comments?,205,,

886,0.97,7020.947,7023.182,Sure.,216,,
887,0.97,7023.182,7047.774,One of the points raised in public comment is the desire as it relates to limiting records retention and Noncase specific reading Dangerousness hearing and specifically limiting it over what I understand to be the current practice.,216,,
888,0.97,7047.774,7083.709,But the Testifier suggested that the amendments as being considered would not cover all use license plate data.,216,,
889,0.97,7083.709,7098.791,Can you tell me whether or not this might be inadvertently leaving a gap in my intent?,216,,
890,0.97,7098.791,7107.2,"I think the speaker was presuming the parking enforcement had been moved out of police already, and they haven't been moved out of police.",217,,
891,0.97,7107.2,7112.605,"The new agency hasn't been stood up, so I don't believe the amendment is leaving anything out.",217,,

899,0.97,7155.248,7156.516,Sure.,222,,
900,0.97,7156.516,7162.889,This is asking for two separate analyses from the office of Inspector general.,222,,
901,0.97,7162.889,7179.272,"I think we all know that there are some communities who feel like they are sort of Surveilled more than other communities, so we are looking for data to verify whether or not that's happening.",222,,
902,0.97,7179.272,7198.257,"The first would require or request that Oig do a demographic analysis on the use of the license plate reader technology by neighborhood, as well as the sharing of data between parking enforcement and patrol.",222,,
903,0.97,7198.257,7212.071,We are really trying to demonstrate or have a baseline of information so we can make any future decisions we may need to make on how that technology is being used.,222,,

1049,0.97,7982.641,7989.047,Let me suggest some language.,315,,
1050,0.97,7989.047,7991.016,That would be awesome.,316,,

1081,0.97,8144.336,8150.475,I would like to move amendment two.,331,,
1082,0.97,8150.475,8150.775,Second.,332,,
1083,0.97,8150.775,8158.617,"Council member Herbold, would you like to spoke to the amendment?",332,,
1084,0.97,8158.617,8188.079,"This amendment requests racial equity disparity analysis on the merchant side of this particular program, a way for folks to Self-Report crimes, an Online reporting tool.",333,,
1085,0.97,8188.079,8236.595,"This request for a report is intended to address one of the issues where they write that Coplogic RAISES civil liberties questions, because an individual is suspected of committing a crime or infraction and will be entered into a Database with no legal standard by a private entity or even notice.",333,,
1086,0.97,8236.595,8259.517,"So this amendment is intended to get more information from the police Department, how Coplogic is being used and to what effect and to what impact, particularly as it relates to the civil liberties concerns and disparate impacts on particular groups of people.",333,,
1087,0.97,8259.517,8262.32,Thank you.,334,,
1088,0.97,8262.32,8267.659,I support this amendment.,334,,
1089,0.97,8267.659,8270.595,Any questions for Council member Herbold?,334,,
1090,0.97,8270.595,8279.104,I'm interested in this but I'm wondering to what degree we already have this information.,335,,
1091,0.97,8279.104,8287.879,There's been a lot of concern so I'm wondering if we have the data already to support the concerns that have been raised.,335,,
1092,0.97,8287.879,8302.594,"My recollection, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that when we acquired with SPD, when they were at the table with us, they did not indicate that they had et.",336,,
1093,0.97,8302.594,8322.58,But much like they do for their enforcement data that they collect they could produce a report from the Coplogic data as well.,336,,
1094,0.97,8322.58,8338.096,That was my understanding also.,337,,
1095,0.97,8338.096,8341.333,I believe we can pull up the the data.,338,,
1096,0.97,8341.333,8343.068,The information is there.,338,,
1097,0.97,8343.068,8358.283,"If a business does in fact report someone and there's no evidence to support the crime, the case detective reviews it and sends it back to the store.",338,,
1098,0.97,8358.283,8366.424,"If it doesn't reach the threshold, we don't accept the report.",338,,
1099,0.97,8366.424,8372.263,And we'll be getting this information this year for this amendment?,339,,
1100,0.97,8372.263,8377.202,"Yes, no later than the third quarter of 2021.",340,,
1101,0.97,8377.202,8381.072,For the past three years is what the amendment would request.,340,,
1102,0.97,8381.072,8382.741,Thank you.,341,,
1103,0.97,8382.741,8393.284,"Thank you, Council members.",342,,
1104,0.97,8393.284,8399.057,Council President Gonzalez?,342,,
1105,0.97,8399.057,8399.457,You're on mute.,342,,
1106,0.97,8399.457,8407.999,Sorry about that.,343,,
1107,0.97,8407.999,8414.272,So a couple of questions: one is a follow-up to the comment.,343,,
1108,0.97,8414.272,8438.43,"So this amendment as written would not capture any racial disparity data related to referrals I'll call them for lack of a better team term, that were sent back?",343,,
1109,0.97,8438.43,8439.297,"Rite, just contacts.",343,,
1110,0.97,8439.297,8448.506,If SPD rejects the report that's not included in this racial disparity analysis?,343,,
1111,0.97,8448.506,8454.412,"Based on how this amendment is written, is that correct.",343,,
1112,0.97,8454.412,8456.247,That's correct.,344,,
1113,0.97,8456.247,8464.923,Am I characterizing that correctly?,345,,
1114,0.97,8464.923,8467.992,"Sort of, yes.",346,,
1115,0.97,8467.992,8470.862,It would be in the system.,346,,
1116,0.97,8470.862,8487.946,"Here the detective sends it back and then discussion with him, he says, I don't do anything with the case and it's automatically deleted.",346,,
1117,0.97,8487.946,8495.753,"I think those that are reporting a crime, that information should be in there.",346,,
1118,0.97,8495.753,8497.155,Okay.,347,,
1119,0.97,8497.155,8512.704,"So the reports that your folks determine are insufficient in terms of the underlying claims, will be sent back and rejected?",347,,
1120,0.97,8512.704,8514.205,Obviously it's in the system.,348,,
1121,0.97,8514.205,8521.913,We haven't Acceptedit to be able to put it in the records management system.,348,,
1122,0.97,8521.913,8526.417,There's an auto Delete after I think about 120 days.,348,,
1123,0.97,8526.417,8530.154,"Oftentimes it's back and forth, you didn't have this or that.",348,,
1124,0.97,8530.154,8540.598,"If we don't accept it, we don't have a record retained in our system.",348,,
1125,0.97,8540.598,8562.62,"Then the second question I had was, so this amendment asks that the Department do the racial disparity analysis, and some of the other amendments we have considered, we asked that Oig do the analysis.",349,,
1126,0.97,8562.62,8578.636,So I'm just wondering why in this amendment SPD is the Analyzer or producer of the report as opposed to the IG?,349,,
1127,0.97,8578.636,8579.671,Thank you.,350,,
1128,0.97,8579.671,8606.631,The inspector is not responsible for the production of all racial disparity impact reports.,350,,
1129,0.97,8606.631,8612.437,"For instance, SPD reports and they are required Legislatively and out of their degree.",350,,
1130,0.97,8612.437,8632.991,"There is an area obviously that the gig has authority, and I'm also sensitive to the fact that the Oig has a process for developing her annual work plan every year.",350,,
1131,0.97,8632.991,8644.202,This is not something I feel I can ask her to do after already submitting my request for her work plan.,350,,
1132,0.97,8644.202,8675.199,I'm saying this as just a raw data dump but I'm open to other options.,351,,
1133,0.97,8675.199,8675.9,Okay.,352,,
1134,0.97,8675.9,8676.467,That's really helpful.,352,,
1135,0.97,8676.467,8683.441,I just wanted us to get a clearer understanding of the decision making process there.,352,,
1136,0.97,8683.441,8700.591,"I think I understand this is truly a rapport as opposed to an analysis of the data, in terms of like trend or top lines.",352,,
1137,0.97,8700.591,8725.149,So I understand the need to generate the report with the data and signal interest in determining how to evaluate the data once we have it so that we aren't drawing conclusions from the data that may not be as well informed as it could be.,352,,
1138,0.97,8725.149,8744.736,Data can paint a lot of pictures and I want to be sure we have an accurate sense of what the data is telling us so it has some utility in the future.,352,,
1139,0.97,8744.736,8756.614,"To that last point, I'm wondering if there's a way before records to get deleted, to capture the information we are interested in.",353,,
1140,0.97,8756.614,8778.503,Otherwise it seems it would be skewed and not serve its purpose if we're not capturing if information because there wasn't enough of a case built and the case was dismissed.,353,,
1141,0.97,8778.503,8792.583,I would be interested in hearing if that's a possibility before we vote on this.,353,,
1142,0.97,8792.95,8797.054,"Captain, are you able to address that?",354,,
1143,0.97,8797.054,8800.691,Only partly.,355,,
1144,0.97,8800.691,8815.873,"I would have to look into seeing if we could grab it and store it, which is counterproductive to what we're talking about here.",355,,
1145,0.97,8815.873,8827.084,"If a business tries to continually abuse the system, then they can be taken off the program itself.",355,,
1146,0.97,8827.084,8854.745,"But in terms of trying to see if someone tried to do that and kicked it back, trying to capture the information here, I would have to look at the Coplogic program and talk to it to see if we can gather it.",355,,
1147,0.97,8854.745,8867.558,Now I have data I can't legally possess.,355,,
1148,0.97,8867.558,8872.73,"Again, it's not getting Pastthem but I would have to look to determine that.",355,,
1149,0.97,8872.73,8879.103,I'm not advocates for keeping more data than we need to have.,356,,
1150,0.97,8879.103,8887.311,Seems like a flaw in this particular effort if we don't actually have the ability to capture that.,356,,
1151,0.97,8887.311,8899.156,"I think the only good thing is, if they try to do that without evidence of a crime, we are probably not capturing it.",357,,
1152,0.97,8899.156,8903.961,"Like you, we don't want to retain any data that's not necessary.",357,,
1153,0.97,8903.961,8906.864,"In that regard, I would agree with you.",357,,
1154,0.97,8906.864,8961.352,"I was going to say quickly I think in terms of the policy choices presented before us, I think while it may have some use to understand if there are racial disparities in the referral portion of this, I feel like the cost benefit analysis there is pretty high in terms of potentially retaining folks' very personal data for longer than we'd like to.",358,,
1155,0.97,8961.352,8985.276,So I think maybe the better option is to focus on those cases that we know were accepted and made their way through the Coplogic system and are being retained to evaluate whether or not there are racial disparities relating to the underlying program.,358,,
1156,0.97,8985.276,9000.524,"Tough choice but I don't want to cut against the bigger intent, which is to limit the retention of all of personally identifiable information by these Technologies.",358,,
1157,0.97,9000.524,9027.251,Appreciate the fact of this line of questioning and realizing it may have the unintended consequence of broadening the scope and the time of retention of personally identifiable information that we don't currently retain.,358,,
1158,0.97,9029.387,9032.356,Thank you for that discussion on amendment two.,359,,
1159,0.97,9032.356,9037.428,"If we don't have any other comments, we can go ahead and vote on it.",359,,

1172,0.97,9071.462,9107.264,"Thank you there are a couple different ways we can do amendment three, either get it out there and move it and second it then amend the amendment, or immediately have the amended amendment before us and vote on that as amendment number three.",369,,
1173,0.97,9107.264,9146.837,"With amendment three, the additional language, is there a way to display that or read that aloud again?",369,,
1174,0.97,9146.837,9158.148,"I think it would be, just add after 2022 and report to Council.",370,,
1175,0.97,9158.148,9194.084,"So amendment three as Presenced on the agenda is being modified to add the words ""and report to Council ."" those words would appear after 2022.",370,,
1176,0.97,9194.084,9200.491,So you would like to move that amendment?,370,,
1177,0.97,9200.491,9201.692,"Thank you, yes.",370,,

1182,0.97,9239.663,9264.154,"We have married from public comment and constituents that a there is an interest or concern about the fact that Coplogic, the information checked by it is held in the cloud and this could create some risk for hacking and Cyberattack.",372,,
1183,0.97,9264.154,9270.661,So there was interest in trying to move that information onto an internal server.,372,,
1184,0.97,9270.661,9285.009,"At the last committee when I raised this, there was concern expressed from I think SPD that that would be very expensive.",372,,
1185,0.97,9285.009,9304.161,This is requesting the inspector general to include in the surveillance review if analysis of the relationship between the costs to continue to do that versus bringing it into a city server.,372,,
1186,0.97,9304.161,9319.209,"That's what we're requesting to do, and now requesting that report be submitted to Council, or presented to Council.",372,,
