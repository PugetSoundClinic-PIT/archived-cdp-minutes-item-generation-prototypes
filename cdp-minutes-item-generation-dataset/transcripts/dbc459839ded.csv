68,0.97,437.069,451.751,It is absolutely ridiculous and I reject on Henry premise that money related to Covid is not covered related legislation it is ridiculous and absurd and this decision needs to be reversed immediately.,42,,
69,0.97,451.751,455.388,There is a triple emergency people are facing.,42,,

76,0.97,485.218,511.177,"My name is Marilyn Yim I'm urging you to vote no like many small landlords we have been working with tenants since the crisis offering rental payment plans the payment plan bill does not anticipate this and will invalidate these agreements when it signed by the Mayor, we cannot carry the burden of waiting 24 months to be made whole.",44,,
77,0.97,511.177,517.383,Now small property owner can afford to go a full year without taking care of other costs.,44,,
78,0.97,520.953,536.469,"Regarding the ban on Eviction history and Rectal screenings people affected by Covid will not have a history through next spring, there is no need to pass this at this time when there are protections in place only people who would be protected are those who chose not to pay their rent.",44,,
79,0.97,536.469,550.049,"It is unfair to enforce payment plans for those who choose not to pay for the housing, it's questionable if this can be considered legal because it's not effective until after the emergency is over.",44,,

83,0.97,563.462,578.077,Good afternoon city council members I am concerned the city council is using the pandemic shutdown as a means to implement dangerous housing laws creating open-ended relief of financial responsibility that no business can afford.,46,,
84,0.97,578.077,600.232,"The Attorney General has said during this time period he can only tax legislation necessary and routine like paying bills or those that are needed to do with the outbreak, the city council proposed bill 119787 nd 119788 are not necessary nor routine and are not needed to deal with the outbreak so cannot be considered at this time.",46,,
85,0.97,600.232,623.155,"Every let's implement it has a cost that is passed to residents for example universally banning Evictions implementing the first entire process and now the ability to screen tenants for prior Evictions results in higher rent, I urge you not to pass 119787 and 119788, they are bad for tenants and VETS for the city.",46,,
86,0.97,623.155,629.261,City Council should be working with housing providers instead of building barriers that provide affordable rent.,46,,
87,0.97,629.261,635.935,The next Speaker is Neil Wilson.,47,,
88,0.97,635.935,675.174,"Hello my name is Neil Wilson I am an independent counsel provider I testified last week asking Council to stop using inaccurate information to support legislation, whether it's Misstating national rent collection numbers or riding a six month Eviction moratorium knowing it's effectively a 12 month moratorium, Seattle calls itself a resident innovative city collaborating from 2015 and to today's bills . This is not progressive or innovative.",48,,
89,0.97,675.174,677.41,It reflects legislation not representation.,48,,
90,0.97,677.41,699.532,"Once again I ask you to please give independent landlords a voice at the table along with the present tenant advocates, city leaders should be bringing tests against real data, creating innovative policies not old ideas that are drastically unfair for regular citizens.",48,,

96,0.97,721.053,731.263,My wife and I have already sold several rentals in the city due to limits that have been passed.,50,,
97,0.97,731.263,757.49,"The Council is directly responsible for pushing up rent by reducing supply, Council President Gonzales writes in a letter to the Attorney General's advice on what the Council can and cannot pass, this is neither routine or necessary nor is it to deal with the outbreak when you clearly have an Eviction record that you're trying to ban.",50,,
98,0.97,763.596,780.613,Forcing small landlords to take low interest loans is an undertaking and asking you to uphold her oath of office not to break the Constitution by passing these ordinances and stop doing things to force up rent.,50,,

106,0.97,827.927,850.282,Okay hello I am here to support the initiative I have no words to express my Angst and average the Councilmembers Gonzalez and Herbold to go hide instead of facing and addressing the issue at hand.,54,,
107,0.97,850.282,877.676,"Was known to give grand feet to the who's who of Rome, the city poor would be burned at the stake's to eliminate the evening, the historian Pacifists asked us to think not about him but his death wondering what it took to enjoy food drink and drama while each have their own went into play you have a simple choice.",54,,
108,0.97,877.676,882.114,Do what is right or you go down in history as one of Nero's deaths.,54,,

110,0.97,890.089,907.74,"Hello, thank you my name is Jessica I am a Renter in district 3 with Councilmember Sawant I am part of the pass Amazon movement and I was sad to learn there will be no vote on the legislation until maybe June.",56,,
111,0.97,907.74,928.06,"I do think this tax Amazon legislation is emergency related to Covid-19 because there is the provision for inter fund loan to provide immediate cash assistance to at least 100,000 people who are struggling with this emergency.",56,,
112,0.97,928.06,931.931,So I think at least we need to address that because people are struggling.,56,,
113,0.97,931.931,946.145,"It seems like there is always an excuse not to tax big business, I think we just need to do it, someone has to pay for this crisis, big business has the money so let's help people utilize this resource.",56,,
114,0.97,946.145,947.613,Thank you very much.,56,,

118,0.97,970.903,978.911,"Please focus on rental assistance not uncontrollable leases, we are in close touch with Renters and are working with them.",58,,
119,0.97,978.911,988.821,"Small-scale housing providers occupy a valuable niche in the city and we are being treated like corporations, we know the tenants and their situations and we are flexible.",58,,
120,0.97,988.821,1011.744,"We don't have reserves because rent is low, we offer discounts to vulnerable tenants, one whose business was shuttered refused to take it saying it is the government job to cover this, he managed to get a loan to cover his expenses but I worry for him taking on more debt, I care about the people we Renter.",58,,
121,0.97,1011.744,1020.452,At one open house one perspective Renter asked what the catch and I told him there was not but he worried the apartment was too good to be true.,58,,
122,0.97,1020.452,1022.921,We are jeopardized by your regulations.,58,,
123,0.97,1022.921,1026.358,Please include us in your decision-making.,58,,

126,0.97,1037.336,1067.699,"I am voicing support of Council bill 119787 and 119788, Renters know that grading house or security leads to better communities and an Eviction case can follow you throughout your life as a Renter and make it difficult to find a new home, most tenants became homeless in of report 37% were and shelter, 25% were in a shelter and another 25% were with family or friends.",60,,
127,0.97,1067.699,1075.107,This would escalate the current health crisis but the bill would mitigate effects to make it easier for evicted people to find new homes.,60,,
128,0.97,1075.107,1083.615,42% of those interviewed had to leave Seattle as a result of their Eviction.,60,,
129,0.97,1083.615,1095.427,"If we do not take action this crisis will push more people out of this especially low income people, we have a duty to fight for neighbors to stay in their homes and stay healthy.",60,,
130,0.97,1095.427,1098.096,Please vote yes on 119787 and 119788.,60,,
131,0.97,1098.096,1102.134,Next up is Edmund.,61,,
132,0.97,1102.134,1145.177,"Hi I run the house and just as project for the King County bar Association and I'm asking you to pass CB 119787 and 119788 I want to thank Council President Gonzalez and the meals provide protection for tenants due to circumstances beyond the control right now there is not enough assistance for tenants falling behind and currently the largest programs are United way, Homebase is backlog by 5000 households and I was after we kept the application process open for 48 hours.",62,,
133,0.97,1145.177,1169.101,This is necessary to make sure tenants will be able to catch up on the rent and the fact that we don't have other needs for them and Councilmember Morales your bill is important want to correct inaccurate assertions that this is unnecessary as it provides protection for tenants evicted for reasons other than rent and we have seen a lot of tenants on the Hotline unable,62,,
134,0.97,1169.101,1173.205,Thank you Edmund for coming in.,63,,

141,0.97,1213.045,1217.849,I'm speaking in favor of CB 119787 and 119788.,64,,
142,0.97,1217.849,1245.844,I volunteer with the organizing collective hosting tenant rights events and we often hear the stories of Renters who are experiencing housing and security issues and because of that both physical and mental health struggles now with this new level of housing emergency that's going to continue way beyond expiration dates we have talked about here we really need these protections.,64,,
143,0.97,1245.844,1259.358,The Council has indicated you understand the power imbalance that exists and I applaud the city for not letting people not at risk to lose their primary Residency and those or set the agenda.,64,,

149,0.97,1297.129,1304.836,We show real leadership and do everything possible to help the hundreds of thousands of people.,66,,
150,0.97,1304.836,1315.847,"Few if any city councils have had an opportunity to do so much good, history will judge if we as a city and city council in times of crisis took care of the most vulnerable and working people.",66,,
151,0.97,1315.847,1320.919,Make children proud that we did everything possible rather than nothing.,66,,

158,0.97,1355.654,1372.304,I would like you to try to imagine a scenario in which you would be asking a Retiree like me who depends on rental income to forgo that income for six months or more for the benefit of someone who is employed and has the ability to pay.,68,,
159,0.97,1372.304,1375.374,The Eviction ban and these ordinances under consideration would do just that.,68,,
160,0.97,1375.374,1394.626,If you're going to go ahead and continue with legislation that threatens and sacrifices the security of my income I am asking that each of you pledge to make the same sacrifice for the duration of the Eviction ban by donating your salary to a rental assistance fund until the plan is over.,68,,

181,0.97,1615.647,1631.262,We should be treating Evictions as a temporary problem rather than allowing them to have permanent consequences because an Eviction case on record even if you come to terms with your landlord it can follow you throughout your life as a Renter.,74,,
182,0.97,1631.262,1639.771,We need to fight and protect neighbors so this means we need to understand this is temporary and should not be following Renters throughout the course of their life.,74,,

214,0.97,2073.771,2094.025,Instead it seems Councilmembers are taking this historic opportunity to fill the working class twice in their attempts to deny Seattle's measures that he needs to bring relief to the working class we are facing a triple emergency pandemic housing crisis and recession.,88,,

I think it was put well that the concerns about the open public meetings act feel like a shallow government transparency argument being used as political cover for those who don't want to tax big business, we know these Council members voted to repeal in 2018 and it is hard to take concerns for this seriously when they were sued for violating the SME Act and discussing the repeal to the head tax in 20 and use taxpayer dollars to pay a settlement for those lawsuits, tax Amazon will fight for taxation in Seattle and recall on city Council and city government to allow Online signatures for these initiatives.",92,,

230,0.97,2269.5,2285.383,"It is ridiculous the Council has decided to discontinue meetings on this bill, we are facing a crisis not only a public health but housing and jobs, a solution that brings in Progressive tax revenue from the largest corporations that have not been paying their fair share.",94,,
231,0.97,2285.383,2298.129,It is the bare minimum that we lobby this tax large corporations operating in Seattle and to begin to address the wider crises of on Affordability in the city that will only continue to be exacerbated by the recession.,94,,
232,0.97,2298.129,2309.54,To not open up this new source of tax revenue by any relief for the crisis would be coming from further austerity down the line by which I mean cuts to vital programs.,94,,

303,0.97,2985.415,3012.242,"I lived in Washington state my entire life and I have been a homeowner and a Renter and I'm asking you to pass this bill because payment plans are going to prevent Evictions and requiring landlords to offer new leases will prevent discrimination and people having to leave their homes and knowing that people cannot leave their homes, payment plans will prevent the landlord from providing debt to collections.",114,,
304,0.97,3012.242,3019.149,And he gives the tenant more time to get back on their feet and stay in their home.,114,,

326,0.97,3197.627,3198.895,Thank you.,129,,
327,0.97,3198.895,3200.931,Good afternoon colleagues.,129,,
328,0.97,3200.931,3218.615,"We have all been talking for weeks and weeks about the crisis that is Covid-19 and we know hundreds of thousands of Washingtonians have filed for unemployment, a growing number cannot afford basics like food or rent and many tens of thousands are right here in Seattle.",129,,
329,0.97,3218.615,3234.664,We know that the spectrum of this crisis one none of us could predict should not haunt people for the rest of their lives so this legislation would do two things to make sure that does not happen.,129,,
330,0.97,3234.664,3243.573,The first is that a bars landlords from denying housing to tenants who have faced Eviction during the emergency and for six months following that.,129,,
331,0.97,3243.573,3258.088,"I want to be clear that this excludes Evictions that would result from the threat to the health or safety of neighbors, the landlord, or tenant or landlord household members.",129,,
332,0.97,3258.088,3281.778,"So we have had several people call in expressing concern and want to make sure those kinds of Evictions are excluded, the second thing is a provides cause for order limited dissemination which would hide Eviction from a tenant screening company and that is something we know is important to keep people from losing housing options.",129,,
333,0.97,3281.778,3286.416,Especially due to the economic shock of the mass unemployment that we have.,129,,
334,0.97,3286.416,3308.004,"We know when the moratoriums end people will be out of work still, this will not be getting better overnight so we're trying to do is make sure we are protecting people long-term until people are able to get back on their feet and we know that these Evictions and unlawful Detainer's can follow Pople around.",129,,
335,0.97,3308.004,3331.961,It might be cleared from your credit report for seven years but altered the stream company has to do is look that up in the Superior Court Website and it can still be found so this is an attempt to make sure we are protecting folks who are in financial crisis during this episode and make sure they have that protection long-term.,129,,
336,0.97,3331.961,3334.331,I am happy to answer questions.,129,,
337,0.97,3334.331,3343.94,Councilmember Morales I know you have an amendment you would like for us to consider.,130,,
338,0.97,3343.94,3360.09,So I would like to go ahead and ask that you put your amendment on the table and we will consider the amendment and then we can open it up for dialogue on the bill as amended.,130,,
339,0.97,3360.09,3367.997,So I moved to amend counsel bill 119787 as presented on amendment one on the agenda.,131,,
340,0.97,3367.997,3372.001,The second?,132,,
341,0.97,3372.001,3372.369,Second.,133,,
342,0.97,3372.369,3380.11,"Moved and Seconded, Councilmember Morales please feel free to address the amendment.",134,,
343,0.97,3380.11,3396.926,"Sure, this is really cleaning up the title of the bill so it makes the original language of the section title more accurate and conforms the new text regarding, sorry that's amendment two.",135,,
344,0.97,3396.926,3399.662,The first is a technical amendment to clean up the language.,135,,
345,0.97,3399.662,3410.14,Are there any questions or comments on amendment one which has been described as a technical cleanup amendment?,136,,
346,0.97,3410.14,3415.812,Okay with the current please call the roll on the adoption of amendment one?,136,,
347,0.97,3415.812,3446.276,"Herbold aye, Herbold, aye, Juarez Herbold aye, Lewis, aye, Morales, aye, Mosqueda, aye, Pedersen",137,,
348,0.97,3446.276,3448.678,Aye,138,,

350,0.97,3451.548,3454.851,Aye,140,,
351,0.97,3454.851,3455.452,President Gonzalez,141,,
352,0.97,3455.452,3457.487,Aye.,142,,
353,0.97,3457.487,3460.757,Nine in favor none opposed.,143,,
354,0.97,3460.757,3462.992,The motion carries in the amendment is adopted.,144,,
355,0.97,3462.992,3468.465,I know you have a second amendment so I will pass it over to you to make the motion.,144,,
356,0.97,3468.465,3485.715,"I move that we, that we amend Council bill 119787 as presented on amendment two on the agenda.",145,,
357,0.97,3485.715,3488.818,Moved and Seconded to amend the bill as presented on amendment two.,146,,
358,0.97,3488.818,3492.222,Councilmember Morales please feel free to address it.,146,,
359,0.97,3492.222,3512.141,This amendment adds a rebuttal presumption in favor of a tenant if a landlord does see the Eviction information and takes adverse action against the tenant as a result of the information.,147,,
360,0.97,3512.141,3512.742,Okay.,148,,
361,0.97,3512.742,3522.852,"Colleagues, any questions or comments on amendment two? it looks like there are no questions or comments.",148,,
362,0.97,3522.852,3530.226,So I will ask that the Kirk clerk please call the roll on adoption of amendment two.,148,,
363,0.97,3530.226,3546.175,"Strauss, aye, Herbold aye, Juarez aye, Lewis aye, Morales aye",148,,
364,0.97,3546.175,3561.19,"Mosqueda aye, Pedersen no so Sawant aye, president Gonzalez aye",149,,
365,0.97,3561.19,3565.561,"Eight in favor, 10 post.",150,,
366,0.97,3565.561,3569.799,Thank you so much the motion carries the amendment is adopted.,151,,
367,0.97,3569.799,3575.104,I believe that is the end of the amendments I am aware of.,151,,
368,0.97,3575.104,3582.211,So now would be a good time colleagues if there are any comments on the bill as amended.,151,,
369,0.97,3582.211,3586.883,"Now is the time to make those comments, I see Councilmember Sawant.",151,,
370,0.97,3586.883,3590.32,Thank you.,152,,
371,0.97,3590.32,3624.654,"Am happy to support this legislation from Councilmember Morales, background checks are set up to be extremely unfair to Renters as we heard from some Renters, for example if your take into Eviction court unfairly and a judge rules there's no reason to Evict you maybe it was discrimination, maybe there was no just cause, regardless it is included in your rental history and it can become extremely difficult to get housing as a result and follows you throughout your life.",152,,
372,0.97,3624.654,3631.561,Renters can appeal to have these false Evictions removed from their record history but must do so with every background check company.,152,,
373,0.97,3631.561,3640.47,Ideally the code would refuse Úto give out Evictions records to background check companies unless those are approved by the judge.,152,,
374,0.97,3640.47,3655.485,"This legislation instructs landlords they must not use Eviction records during this emergency against Renters, they should not anyway because Evictions are prohibited during this emergency but as I said the background rules exist.",152,,
375,0.97,3655.485,3674.003,"Obviously there will be difficulty with enforcement and ultimately what Seattle needs is affordable background checks so Renters can correct calls and Eviction records on their background checks . in the meantime, I am happy to vote yes on this emergency legislation.",152,,
376,0.97,3674.003,3684.647,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss, again for anybody else who wants to speak if you can raise your hand I will put you in the Queue.",153,,
377,0.97,3684.647,3715.711,"Thank you I will take this opportunity to reiterate my strong support for increasing the amount of rental assistance that we can provide people in the community because when we are able to invest in rental assistance we are able to keep people in place and keep everyone in the economic chain made full, so again reiterating I will be voting for this legislation and we also need to follow-up with additional rental assistance, thank you.",154,,
378,0.97,3715.711,3720.75,Thank you so much Councilmember Strauss for the important reminder.,155,,
379,0.97,3720.75,3735.731,We have already added millions of dollars for rental assistance and certainly not implying that is going to meet the scale of the need but we will continue to make sure we are advocating for those dollars.,155,,
380,0.97,3735.731,3743.272,Councilmember Pedersen is next and I have not seen anybody else raise their hand so if you want to now is the time.,155,,
381,0.97,3743.272,3759.555,I would like to thank the sponsor of this bill Councilmember Morales and the hard work of her staff come I believe it is important to point out to the public this bill has very good intentions.,156,,
382,0.97,3759.555,3764.193,He was just introduced seven days ago.,156,,
383,0.97,3764.193,3767.196,I believe that's not enough time to consider all the ramifications of the legislation.,156,,
384,0.97,3767.196,3776.172,It would also be an effect for an unknown period of time because we don't know when the Mayor will end the emergency declaration.,156,,
385,0.97,3776.172,3805.434,"So I'm proud to join my counsel my colleagues on a couple of Eviction prevention measures, the winter Eviction moratorium and then recently last week the restricting to allow defense for six months after the Mayor Eviction moratorium ends and that is an important point so the legislation passed last week was for six months after the Mayor's Eviction moratorium ends.",156,,
386,0.97,3805.434,3812.742,The legislation before us would be six months after the emergency declaration.,156,,
387,0.97,3812.742,3816.012,We do not know when the emergency declaration will end.,156,,
388,0.97,3816.012,3818.447,It's possible that it could go on for more than a year.,156,,
389,0.97,3818.447,3830.827,"The reason is, it's likely the Mayor will keep that in place longer than her Eviction moratorium because the emergency declaration will enable us to get reimbursed by the Federal Government for a longer period of time.",156,,
390,0.97,3830.827,3845.474,So I am uncomfortable also in invoking the city charter legislative emergency clause where it says it's necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace health or safety.,156,,
391,0.97,3845.474,3860.089,"This is something that we can do in the next couple weeks or more if we think it through even further and had more data about the situation is going to be for tenants, for the relief package is and when the Declaration will end.",156,,
392,0.97,3860.089,3870.666,Again I want to thing thank my colleague and making her staff available to answer questions.,156,,
393,0.97,3870.666,3875.471,"Thank you, next is Councilmember Herbold and then Councilmember Lewis.",157,,
394,0.97,3875.471,3897.893,"I want to join my colleagues in the Council in thanking Councilmember Morales for bringing forward this legislation, I think it is really important to realize that the use of Eviction history as an indicator of good tenancy is controversial.",158,,
395,0.97,3897.893,3908.037,Under normal circumstances it is Premised on the belief about tenants behave under normal or Nonpandemic conditions.,158,,
396,0.97,3908.037,3928.357,"As we all have Recognied in the context of the current emergency, tenants are facing unprecedented circumstances and how they balance financial obligations in these unprecedented times are not a good indicator of whether or not they're going to be a good tenant.",158,,
397,0.97,3928.357,3985.014,"There was some comment on behalf of public testimony earlier, questioning whether or not this legislation had received the law Department review . I'm happy to report that it has and I find that the analysis without divulging the analysis is reassuring on our ability to move this forward, to move the legislation forward and I want to recognize there Úwere some amendments that were being considered early on that would've been cleanup amendments unrelated to the crisis and that the amendment sponsors agreed to withdraw those you know really housekeeping cleanup amendments because those amendments were not related to the Covid-19 crisis.",158,,
398,0.97,3985.014,3999.028,And finally I think it's really important to understand in practice how these orders of limited dissemination actually work and that is why the bill itself has two parts.,158,,
399,0.97,3999.028,4010.206,On one hand it Notifies the courts what we hope they will do when there are requests for limited dissemination orders.,158,,
400,0.97,4010.206,4019.949,That is the ability of Eviction records to show up on scouting reports.,158,,
401,0.97,4019.949,4047.176,This is a fallback the prohibition on the part of landlords in using this information and the reason why that's necessary is because the practice of the courts in making decisions around limited dissemination orders has really been inconsistent and there has not been an appellate case on this so the courts are not consistent on it.,158,,
402,0.97,4047.176,4065.461,Specifically it's important to recognize the entire right to ask for limited dissemination order and the obligation of courts to consider it is a discretionary decision on the part of the judges.,158,,
403,0.97,4065.461,4085.614,So that's why I think this piece of legislation hangs well together with its two parts as well as in coordination with the legislation that we are going to be hearing next as well as the tenant write legislation that was passed last week.,158,,
404,0.97,4085.614,4090.619,"Take you so much, next is Councilmember Lewis.",159,,
405,0.97,4090.619,4092.822,Thank you.,160,,
406,0.97,4092.822,4115.811,I will start my comments by saying I will be voting for this legislation and I want to thank Councilmember Morales for bringing this forward . It is important that Renters were going to be coming out of this Covid-19 crisis not be in a position where having an otherwise good record is Blemished by something that may or may not happen.,160,,
407,0.97,4115.811,4157.253,With their ability to pay rent during this period . I think it is important legislation and a supportive voting for it but I wanted to take a moment to use my comments to do a broad call to action to landlords and tenant write advocates who tuned into this and I appreciate their public comment . I want to say that our Council remains committed as indicated earlier in the session to providing robust comprehensive and expansive rent support.,160,,
408,0.97,4157.253,4166.996,That will ultimately lead tenants stay in place that will make landlords hole and pay their bills and pay their mortgages.,160,,
409,0.97,4166.996,4190.252,"We are committed to realizing that and as the Council President indicated earlier we have invested millions of dollars above and beyond what we had budgeted for initially in rental assistance and support, Congress according to my conversations with the congressional delegation is considering another round of Federal stimulus and investment.",160,,
410,0.97,4190.252,4212.908,"I would like to shout out to all the landlords and tenants who have called in to do advocacy on this to make sure you're reaching out to your member of Congress, to your senators, to push to make sure widescale rent relief or some Knd of direct payment plan to people as part of that next level of Federal relief.",160,,
411,0.97,4212.908,4245.14,"All of us recognize that is ultimately what we need to do to get through this but in the meantime there need to be protections to make sure Renters are not burdened by things that happen during this event of great depression level proportions and these are not regulations or hindrances that we are enacting idling, we are doing it in response to an unprecedented since the time of the 1930s levels of unemployment and insecurity.",160,,
412,0.97,4245.14,4262.257,So join me in making sure we go to Congress to say we need a large-scale relief in the next package that should be coming out later this spring to make sure Renters and landlords get the support they need to get through this.,160,,
413,0.97,4262.257,4267.763,Thank you Councilman for Lewis.,161,,
414,0.97,4267.763,4270.599,Any other comments or questions on the bill?,161,,
415,0.97,4270.599,4285.414,Okay seeing none Councilmember Morales as we usually practice the prime sponsor of the bill gets the last word so the floor is yours.,161,,
416,0.97,4285.414,4295.591,I want to thank Councilmember Lewis I think your remarks are important to remember this is unprecedented.,162,,
417,0.97,4295.591,4307.336,"We are seeing levels of unemployment, a scale of crisis we have not seen in a couple of generations now.",162,,
418,0.97,4307.336,4314.843,So we know the more rental assistance is important as Councilmember Lewis said there's a lot of Federal action needed.,162,,
419,0.97,4314.843,4319.515,Our representative is advocating for payment protection.,162,,
420,0.97,4319.515,4323.419,Paycheck protection for all workers.,162,,
421,0.97,4323.419,4340.069,So that they can cover their bills so we do need to keep advocating at every jurisdictional level to ensure every city state and Federal Government is doing all they can to keep our community safe.,162,,
422,0.97,4340.069,4349.578,I want to also say that as Counclmember Herbold mentioned we had a discussion on a few different kinds of amendments.,162,,
423,0.97,4349.578,4390.219,"The idea of excluding small landlords is something we talked about but what we are doing is trying to protect people from being evicted and having a stain on the record and when you have lost your job, when you cannot afford rent it does not matter if your landlord is your roommate in a single-family home and you're renting a room from them or if your landlord is a big property management company, the fact is you do not have money to pay rent so you deserve the same protection regardless of the size are ownership of your landlord.",162,,

435,0.97,4487.082,4493.222,Clerk you may be on mute.,166,,
436,0.97,4493.222,4515.477,Agenda item 2 Council bill 119788 ordinance relating to residential rental agreements allowing residential tenants to pay rent in installments when the tenant is unable to timely pay rent declaring an emergency and establishing an immediate effective date all by a 3/4 vote of the city council.,167,,
437,0.97,4515.477,4522.951,Thank you Madame clerk I will move to pass Council bill 119788 a second?,168,,
438,0.97,4522.951,4523.652,Second.,169,,
439,0.97,4523.652,4538.533,"Moved and Seconded to pass the bill, this is a bill I have sponsored so I'm going to make a few comments and then I will open it up for additional comments.",170,,
440,0.97,4538.533,4552.08,Today we have this bill be forced to ensure more flexibility and time for more households that may need to stay housed the will definitely need to stay housed as we enter week 11 of this public health emergency.,170,,
441,0.97,4552.08,4565.093,Many constituents have found themselves laid off or with a loss of income and are still waiting for unemployment benefits to cover household expenses.,170,,
442,0.97,4565.093,4591.92,"We are still waiting for other forms of relief such as the cares act to provide cash in rental assistance to tenants and small landlords, this bill will enable more households to enter into payments with their landlords and I want to take a moment to acknowledge the landlords who already have this practice in place . It is considered the industry's best practice and many good landlords are engaging in that behavior but there are many that are not.",170,,
443,0.97,4591.92,4613.642,"This best practice again is to voluntarily enter into payment plans, we want to ensure the greatest number of tenants have access to this best practice and that this legislation ultimately will mandate that they participate in that best practice.",170,,
444,0.97,4613.642,4638.467,"This bill would prohibit late fees or interest or other charges associated with late payment of rent which would apply throughout the course of civil emergency and for six months after the public health crisis is over, the governor has extended expanded Evictions orders with similar protections and I believe this bill complements the protections for Renters in the government moratorium.",170,,
445,0.97,4638.467,4666.094,"Iwant to thank the Department of inspection and construction, Washington can and the Washington multi family housing Association landlords and property owners for their feedback and insights in the development of the legislation for something very straightforward and simple allowing tenants flexibility that they need to stay in their homes in the event they fall behind on rent.",170,,
446,0.97,4666.094,4686.214,This is a commonsense solution to create a Pathway for tenants and landlords to come to an agreement mutually beneficial to both of them that will promote housing stability and that will ultimately create an opportunity for people to stay in place for as long as possible.,170,,
447,0.97,4686.214,4709.638,I was pleased when I had an opportunity to talk to the governor's office about this legislation that the implemented a similar effort statewide and I think it is important for us to follow-up on that particular route and do the same right here in the city of Seattle.,170,,
448,0.97,4709.638,4729.524,"So I would appreciate your support of this particular bill, I think it is so important and creates a really rich Ecosystem for Renters who are really seeking a little bit more time and a lot more substance to stay housed.",170,,
449,0.97,4729.524,4739.267,With that being said I am happy to open it up to colleagues if there are any comments on the bill.,170,,
450,0.97,4739.267,4740.669,Councilmember Herbold followed by Councilmember Pedersen.,170,,
451,0.97,4740.669,4746.241,Thank you I want to thank Council President Gonzalez for putting this forward.,171,,
452,0.97,4746.241,4758.987,I want to thank her for her collaboration in developing this legislation collaboration that led to some unfortunate delays but I appreciate your doing so.,171,,
453,0.97,4758.987,4771.967,Some of the changes in the new version relate specifically to modify the reason for which a tenant can use the payment plan.,171,,
454,0.97,4771.967,4794.122,Changing the requirement to reintroduce it and this was important because it would be very difficult to ask a judge to make a determination whether or not a nonpayment of rent Eviction is the result of Covid- 19.,171,,
455,0.97,4794.122,4806.101,And so making the change in the ordinance LIFTS that barrier for the courts and helps tenants in doing so.,171,,
456,0.97,4806.101,4833.728,But again that required the patience of the bill sponsor to do so and our counsel present is always patient with us so I want to thank her for other elements related to late fees and attorney fees and court costs.,171,,
457,0.97,4833.728,4858.086,That is very helpful and I want to underscore some of the comments that the sponsor made which is related to this just being a commonsense path between an Eviction moratorium where people don't have anything to do if they are short on rent but not pay rent and paying the full rent.,171,,
458,0.97,4858.086,4882.877,"When the Mayor proposed or Eviction moratorium in the FAQ questions were answered, one of the pieces of guidance for tenants when they don't have enough money to pay is to encourage tenants to work on developing a payment plan for partial payments.",171,,
459,0.97,4882.877,4888.016,In order to reduce the amount of money owed at the end of the moratorium.,171,,
460,0.97,4888.016,4911.539,"This puts into ordinance, a policy a way to do that and again I think it is a commonsense approach expressing our expectations that landlords should accept partial payment because it's good for both landlords and tenants so thank you again.",171,,
461,0.97,4911.539,4914.542,Thank you so much.,172,,
462,0.97,4914.542,4924.319,We have appreciated your partnership on this bill as well and I have appreciated benefiting from your experience so thank you so much.,172,,
463,0.97,4924.319,4925.954,Next up is Councilmember Pedersen.,172,,
464,0.97,4925.954,4939.768,"Thank you Council president and thank you to your staff for the hard work on this bill, we have plenty of notice to think about this one so we appreciate that.",173,,
465,0.97,4939.768,4944.639,Did have concerns and questions.,173,,
466,0.97,4944.639,4967.595,"Just want to confirm for the record, if there is a rental agreement, payment plan in effect between a tenant and landlord that is fully executed already, with this legislation preempt that or Supersede that or would it still be in place?",173,,
467,0.97,4967.595,4994.923,"This is not designed to preempt anything, it would provide a minimal floor's with the existing agreement between the landlord and tenant is more strict or harsh for example I should say you know not as beneficial for the tenant as the ordinance then the ordinance would come into effect.",174,,
468,0.97,4994.923,5001.329,Okay all right I did not know that.,175,,
469,0.97,5001.329,5011.439,I thought if there was a written agreement in place this would not Supersede it but it sounds like it would if it is not as beneficial for the tenant.,175,,
470,0.97,5011.439,5019.547,According to Council central staff again it does not preempt existing agreements.,176,,
471,0.97,5019.547,5022.65,Okay thank you.,177,,
472,0.97,5022.65,5025.453,Just wanted to better understand.,177,,
473,0.97,5025.453,5057.986,"I know in my remarks for the previous bill, my concern is that we don't know when the emergency declaration will end, your previous bill was six months after the Eviction moratorium where this is six months after the emergency declaration and since that may go on for a long period of time I did not know if help for the public and for me to understand why they are different in a starting point in the legislation.",177,,
474,0.97,5057.986,5070.565,I think as you mentioned these things are not done with precision and it's a little unclear to us when the moratorium is going to end.,178,,
475,0.97,5070.565,5093.321,"I acknowledge that creates some uncertainty but the reality is, the financial crisis or the opportunity to enter into a truly beneficial rental agreement is a valid policy priority regardless of the timing.",178,,
476,0.97,5093.321,5120.949,So again I think originally we thought about starting that point somewhere else but at this juncture it makes most sense to allow the greatest possible period of time for landlords and tenants to enter into a mutually beneficial agreement to allow landlords to get their rent and for Renters to pay their rent and avoid Eviction.,178,,
477,0.97,5120.949,5127.255,So again as Councilmember Herbold described this is that middle ground area.,178,,
478,0.97,5127.255,5158.987,"So we have extremes in the landlord and tenant law now, one extreme is Eviction, you lose your housing, the other option is don't pay your rent and we are trying to create a Pathway forward that says for those landlords and tenants who agree that rent needs to be paid and I believe that's the vast majority of folks, we need to be able to create an opportunity for them to come up with a Pathway to do so.",178,,
479,0.97,5158.987,5172.7,So this Codifies that intent and opportunity for landlords and tenants to agree with each other about what the rental repayment plan is going to look like.,178,,
480,0.97,5172.7,5175.303,Thank you.,179,,
481,0.97,5175.303,5183.411,Any other questions or comments?,180,,
482,0.97,5183.411,5185.313,Okay.,180,,
483,0.97,5185.313,5189.984,So I'm going to close out debate.,180,,
484,0.97,5189.984,5223.051,I really do appreciate the ongoing attention in this area and again I said this during briefing but I want to thank central Council staff and my office for being stellar on this policy issue and really working hard to make sure as pieces were moving at the state related to the proclamation about rental payment plans statewide and our version of the bill that we were not running into areas of conflict potentially.,180,,
485,0.97,5223.051,5235.73,Also I want to thank the executives for their support in moving in this direction as well and I have been grateful for the cooperation.,180,,
486,0.97,5235.73,5246.274,On understanding enforcement issues at play and looking forward to signing this into law pretty quickly as has been indicated.,180,,
487,0.97,5246.274,5254.616,So with that being said I will ask that the clerk please call the role please on the passage of the bill.,180,,
