85,0.97,33898.331,33901.601,Thank you so much for being here.,26,,
86,0.97,33901.601,33910.576,I'm going to turn it over to Councilmember Lewis and Counselmember Herbold.,26,,
87,0.97,33910.576,33920.419,"As the chair of this committee that relates to addressing the homelessness crisis, I would love to turn it to you for opening remarks.",26,,
88,0.97,33920.419,33922.321,"Thank you, Madame chair.",27,,
89,0.97,33922.321,33929.729,And it's good to be here this morning to begin this critical conversation about the most pressing issue the city is facing.,27,,
90,0.97,33929.729,33932.865,I think that's saying something in the year like 2020.,27,,
91,0.97,33932.865,33950.683,"But, you know, in the year that has seen four declarations of States of civil emergency, the one that we began with in 2020 and that we will have on the other side of 2020 is the massive crisis we're facing around homelessness in the city of Seattle.",27,,
92,0.97,33950.683,33962.561,And it is by far the issue that my office and I'm sure I speak for a number of us continue to hear the most constituent concern about.,27,,
93,0.97,33962.561,33972.938,It is the thing that I think really impacts and affects all of the other policy discussions we're having whenever we talk about public health.,27,,
94,0.97,33972.938,33978.01,It is a massive consideration that we have so many people living unsheltered in the city of Seattle.,27,,
95,0.97,33978.01,34008.107,"When we were talking about the climate change and the massive influx of smoke and the hazard that that exposes people living unsheltered to, we talk about chronic homelessness and people have a place to isolate and secure in place from Covid-19, it puts homelessness in the forefront.",27,,
96,0.97,34008.107,34038.971,And it puts front and center the amount of additional money from the state and Federal Government that we have been spending on emergency response to homelessness that failure to successfully implement a housing first strategy at scale will have long-term emergency triage costs going forward to get people to shelter temporarily to avoid the exposure to hazards.,27,,
97,0.97,34038.971,34044.877,That is an expense the governments are occurring unless we get a handle on this.,27,,
98,0.97,34044.877,34054.52,And that's something reading between the lines of the presentation will get worse with future Pandemics and future climate emergency.,27,,
99,0.97,34054.52,34071.57,"Some of the things in the presentation from reviewing the materials, there will be new resources for longer-term shelter, rapid Rehousing, Hoteling, and permanent supportive housing.",27,,
100,0.97,34071.57,34093.993,There is also going to be some new proposals and reforms in how the city can adjust the outreach strategy to respond to some of the long-time community criticisms and concerns around the navigation team and how the navigation team has been used as an outreach strategy.,27,,
101,0.97,34093.993,34097.863,And that will be included in the presentation as well.,27,,
102,0.97,34097.863,34101.801,"With that, I have a lot of questions.",27,,
103,0.97,34101.801,34105.037,I want to sequence them through the presentation.,27,,
104,0.97,34105.037,34108.04,I'll leave it at that for the opening remarks.,27,,
105,0.97,34108.04,34113.446,I look forward to hearing from the executive panel and from everybody here.,27,,
106,0.97,34113.579,34120.82,"Thank you very much, council Councilmember Lewis.",28,,
107,0.97,34120.82,34126.392,Looking forward to hearing question as lead as the homelessness response for the Council.,28,,
108,0.97,34126.392,34126.792,It's appreciated.,28,,
109,0.97,34126.792,34130.863,And we look forward to learning more from your questions.,28,,
110,0.97,34130.863,34139.805,As I was reminded that I remembered that Councilmember Herbold has Nonhomelessness related issues.,28,,
111,0.97,34139.805,34149.782,We will turn it over to deputy Mayor Sixkiller.,28,,
112,0.97,34149.782,34151.05,"Councilmember Lewis, thank you.",28,,
113,0.97,34151.05,34152.985,"Deputy Mayor, please take it away.",28,,

117,0.97,34159.425,34164.096,Thank you for inviting us to speak today.,29,,
118,0.97,34164.096,34171.303,The Mayor's 2021 budget is an investment in a framework to move from homelessness to housing.,29,,

120,0.97,34173.939,34191.056,"It takes a next step in the city's Covid response by creating more safe spaces, investing in hotel rooms and shelters connected to increase rapid Rehousing dollars and Phu units.",29,,
121,0.97,34191.056,34196.228,It helps people living unsheltered connect to safer shelter and move to housing.,29,,
122,0.97,34196.228,34202.134,"Today, we'll provide a brief summary of the city-wide homelessness spending.",29,,
123,0.97,34202.134,34209.375,And then do a deeper dive on the Componentings of the 2021 homelessness budget.,29,,
124,0.97,34209.375,34215.281,"Fund source, Semiri, budget programs and changes to the budget in comparison to the 2020 adopted budget.",29,,
125,0.97,34215.281,34226.592,"We will talk about our ongoing Covid-19 response, which I think is important foundation for following us on what we're proposing for 2021.",29,,
126,0.97,34226.592,34238.671,"As well as following up and providing detail of the announcement yesterday about 2021 investments in emergency shelter and prevention investments, our outreach strategy for 2021.",29,,
127,0.97,34238.671,34248.948,And provide an update on the King County regional homelessness authority and our racial equity impacts for 2021 investments.,29,,
128,0.97,34248.948,34251.984,We have tried to streamline the presentation to get through it.,29,,
129,0.97,34251.984,34261.527,I'm sure you have questions and we want to make sure we are able to respond to those.,29,,
130,0.97,34261.527,34267.466,"Councilmember Mosqueda, if we could get through the presentation and take questions, that might be the best way.",29,,
131,0.97,34267.466,34271.87,But we defer to you if you want us to stop and take questions.,29,,
132,0.97,34271.87,34275.207,"With that, we're delighted to be here and ready to get going.",29,,

151,0.97,34351.05,34359.858,"For the purposes of today's conversation, we'll focus on where there has been a significant change in funding or a change in policy.",31,,
152,0.97,34359.858,34366.198,We're not intending to highlight all of the areas of spending.,31,,
153,0.97,34366.198,34369.501,So not all 11 city departments' spending.,31,,
154,0.97,34369.501,34373.005,"If policy or funding is unchanged, we're not intending to touch on that.",31,,

170,0.97,34435.0,34439.972,But I know that Councilmember Lewis has a question.,32,,
171,0.97,34439.972,34440.973,"I'm sorry, Councilmember Pedersen.",32,,
172,0.97,34440.973,34441.373,"No, it is me.",33,,
173,0.97,34441.373,34441.874,"Oh, good.",34,,
174,0.97,34441.874,34442.074,Okay.,34,,
175,0.97,34442.074,34444.41,Thank you.,34,,
176,0.97,34444.41,34446.478,Happy to answer any questions.,35,,
177,0.97,34446.478,34453.786,"If we could go back to the last slide, please.",36,,
178,0.97,34453.786,34455.087,I want to ask clarifying questions here.,36,,
179,0.97,34455.087,34463.896,I am sure the members of the public and the Council would be interested.,36,,
180,0.97,34463.896,34466.064,The emergency bracket here.,36,,
181,0.97,34466.064,34468.967,What does that encompass?,36,,
182,0.97,34468.967,34472.538,Is that like 911 response services?,36,,
183,0.97,34472.538,34477.075,"Is it like Emt and police, fire, or is it something else?",36,,
184,0.97,34477.075,34484.116,"And then how broad, for my second question, how broad is the housing and prevention?",36,,
185,0.97,34484.116,34488.387,Are those permanent support I housing investments?,36,,
186,0.97,34488.387,34492.224,Or does that include shelter systems and tiny houses.,36,,
187,0.97,34492.224,34493.625,Great question.,37,,
188,0.97,34493.625,34495.494,I'm happy to clarify.,37,,
189,0.97,34495.494,34495.761,Thank you.,37,,
190,0.97,34495.761,34502.501,We started defining the homelessness investments outside of the human services Department a couple of years ago.,37,,
191,0.97,34502.501,34507.506,"Our defining criteria were would the service exist, but for the homelessness crisis.",37,,
192,0.97,34507.506,34512.077,So is the homelessness crisis the reason why the services are here?,37,,
193,0.97,34512.077,34516.448,"So using that lens, we don't include 911 calls.",37,,
194,0.97,34516.448,34522.888,That service would exist with or without a homelessness crisis.,37,,
195,0.97,34522.888,34537.502,"In the emergency category, we're talking about unsheltered response, outreach contracts, shelter hygiene and day centers, transitional housing.",37,,
196,0.97,34537.502,34549.014,"And in the housing bucket, in particular, we have the diversion and prevention dollars, housing resource center at O.H., the permanent support of housing services dollars.",37,,
197,0.97,34549.014,34550.549,We don't count the housing investments.,37,,
198,0.97,34550.549,34554.686,And we have the services dollars there.,37,,
199,0.97,34554.686,34555.254,And we have rapid Rehousing.,37,,
200,0.97,34555.387,34558.824,I appreciate that clarification.,38,,
201,0.97,34558.824,34572.437,"I think it is interesting just to make an observation this early that, you know, since 2017, the housing interventions appear to--or funding remained mostly consistent.",38,,
202,0.97,34572.437,34576.241,But the emergency funding has gone way up.,38,,
203,0.97,34576.241,34588.82,"That's an interesting, I think, comment on more broadly some of the interventions that we need to see in housing and prevention Maybe to prevent the need for some of the emergency investments.",38,,
204,0.97,34588.82,34592.357,I appreciate the clarification that emergency includes transitional shelter.,38,,
205,0.97,34592.357,34594.293,I think I heard you say that.,38,,
206,0.97,34594.293,34605.07,"So the tiny House villages, the 24/7 Shelterings, those are emergency investments under this chart?",38,,
207,0.97,34605.07,34605.203,.,38,,
208,0.97,34605.203,34605.504,Correct.,39,,
209,0.97,34605.504,34606.972,"Okay, thank you.",40,,
210,0.97,34606.972,34609.207,Thank you.,41,,
211,0.97,34609.207,34609.574,Please continue.,41,,
212,0.97,34609.574,34609.908,Of course.,42,,
213,0.97,34609.908,34616.582,So we just talked about the $23.5 million from the emergency services grant.,42,,
214,0.97,34616.582,34617.649,The Esg dollars.,42,,
215,0.97,34617.649,34629.261,There's on the pie in the darker blue that you see here $5.85 million from the third and final allocation from the Federal Government from the C.A.R.E.S.,42,,
216,0.97,34629.261,34629.428,Act.,42,,
217,0.97,34629.428,34633.532,This is the community development block grant dollars.,42,,
218,0.97,34633.532,34636.368,These funds were awarded late to the city.,42,,
219,0.97,34636.368,34641.607,They are factored in to the spending plan that we're talking about today.,42,,
220,0.97,34641.607,34644.977,They didn't make it into the actual proposed budget.,42,,
221,0.97,34644.977,34649.848,We have to work with the Council on an amendment to get the dollars in there.,42,,
222,0.97,34649.848,34656.254,"If you're looking to compare to budget book versus today, there's a $5.8 million difference.",42,,
223,0.97,34656.254,34657.122,That's what it's coming from.,42,,
224,0.97,34657.122,34660.325,"My apologies, we couldn't get it in there at the last minute.",42,,
225,0.97,34660.325,34674.639,"And finally, there's $10 million here, and this is from the joint $45 million Covid-19 relief spending plan agreed to between the Councilmembers and the Mayor.",42,,
226,0.97,34674.639,34677.776,That's $8 million for renting assistance and $2 million for the support.,42,,
227,0.97,34677.776,34683.382,And we'll get into the specifics of how the dollars will be spent.,42,,
228,0.97,34683.382,34692.691,I want to reiterate a note that director noble made on Wednesday that the 2021 budget does not rely on FEMA reimbursement.,42,,
229,0.97,34692.691,34701.166,"We have received revised guidance from FEMA that we don't feel comfortable projecting reimbursements to 2021, so we haven't done so.",42,,
230,0.97,34701.166,34708.273,"We are reading their guidance, which is stating that they want us to shift funding on to other eligible Federal spending sources.",42,,
231,0.97,34708.273,34711.309,So the budget is doing just that.,42,,
232,0.97,34711.309,34722.688,We are shifting to Esg to support the costs that we have otherwise be supported with FEMA reimbursement in 2020.,42,,
233,0.97,34722.688,34731.296,"Julie, do you not feel comfortable includes the FEMA dollars because you don't know if it will come, or you don't know how much it will be?",43,,
234,0.97,34731.296,34746.678,The guidance at this point from the Feds is they have removed an end date for FEMA from reimbursement for the emergency window that they will entertain eligible expenses.,44,,
235,0.97,34746.678,34753.418,"And instead, it's reliant upon the public health date, which is only extended in 90-day increments.",44,,
236,0.97,34753.418,34766.932,"At this point, given all that we know and what we're hearing from the experts and the team in office of emergency management, we're not comfortable forecasting that FEMA is entertaining the eligible costs past the end of 2020.",44,,
237,0.97,34766.932,34770.435,That could change in the next month.,44,,
238,0.97,34770.435,34771.002,But we will keep you posted.,44,,
239,0.97,34771.136,34774.439,We will keep advocating for that.,45,,
240,0.97,34774.439,34774.673,Yeah.,46,,
241,0.97,34774.673,34789.554,"So with that, I'll turn it over to Joe Kasperski, the chief financial officer of Hsd working through the changes in the budget structure and the specifics on the spending.",46,,
242,0.97,34789.554,34790.789,Thank you.,46,,
243,0.97,34790.922,34792.457,"Good morning, everyone.",47,,
244,0.97,34792.457,34792.891,"Next slide, please.",47,,
245,0.97,34792.891,34794.659,"Thank you, Julie.",47,,
246,0.97,34794.659,34804.736,"And good morning, everyone, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to introduce Hsd's proposed homelessness investment strategy.",47,,
247,0.97,34804.736,34811.91,"As a brief introduction, I have had the privilege as being selected for the chief financial officer in February.",47,,
248,0.97,34811.91,34825.49,I am looking forward to supporting you and your staff as we open up the next chapter in our continued efforts in ensuring all the people of Seattle are housed.,47,,
249,0.97,34825.49,34831.096,The fiscal year proposed budget reflects the passion and priority of the city to end homelessness.,47,,
250,0.97,34831.096,34841.239,This year's budget proposal continues the momentum and the funding sources we have gained in responding to the Covid-19 pandemic.,47,,
251,0.97,34841.239,34856.621,"We will seek your support and endorsement of the proposed budget, which is comprised of $75.9 million commitment from the general Fund and $59.3 million from external funding sources.",47,,
252,0.97,34856.621,34873.805,This proposal also reflects navigation of the normal elimination of seven positions and the transfer of six pockets to the proposed safety community division that was introduced yesterday by director Johnson and will be discussed in subsequent slides.,47,,
253,0.97,34873.805,34882.38,"Pending no further questions, I have introduced and will turn over the presentation to director Johnson to discuss and guide you through the details of the budget.",47,,
254,0.97,34882.38,34884.382,Thank you for this opportunity and time.,47,,
255,0.97,34884.382,34885.684,"Thank you, Joe.",48,,
256,0.97,34885.684,34892.49,I do want to ask a question that I believe you already covered.,48,,
257,0.97,34892.49,34904.803,"But can you tell us if this budget, how much of the budget parallels to investments in the other authority?",48,,
258,0.97,34904.803,34910.675,Is there a complement RI amount reserved for regional authority investments?,48,,
259,0.97,34910.675,34910.909,Yes.,49,,
260,0.97,34910.909,34926.091,"As the transition occurs during fiscal year 2021 for the regional authority, if I understand your question correctly, we are committing of this $120.4 million managed by King County regional housing authority.",49,,
261,0.97,34926.091,34940.138,"The transition, overcome, has been delayed due to our efforts and focus both by the city and King County on responding to all of the Pandemics and crisis that we witnessed during this past year.",49,,
262,0.97,34940.138,34948.947,That transfer is anticipated to occur during the first period of fiscal year 2021.,49,,
263,0.97,34948.947,34958.023,"And Councilmember Lewis, I apologize for not asking this in advance of you, I have not been briefed.",50,,
264,0.97,34958.023,34964.996,"And deputy Mayor, if you have anything to add.",50,,
265,0.97,34964.996,34973.204,$120.4 million of the $151.7 at some point would transition to the regional authority when the authority is stood up.,50,,
266,0.97,34973.204,34974.039,Is that correct?,50,,
267,0.97,34974.039,34976.808,That is correct.,51,,
268,0.97,34976.808,34977.175,Thank you.,51,,
269,0.97,34977.175,34980.345,This is Jason Johnson with the human services Department.,51,,
270,0.97,34980.345,34982.48,We can go to the next slide.,51,,
271,0.97,34982.614,34985.784,"And Jason, just very quickly on that.",52,,
272,0.97,34985.784,34986.084,I'm sorry.,52,,
273,0.97,34986.084,34988.42,I get the delay.,52,,
274,0.97,34988.42,34994.125,Everything has been thrown out of any sort of plan that we had prior to Covid.,52,,
275,0.97,34994.125,34994.726,I absolutely understand that.,52,,
276,0.97,34994.726,35004.736,Do we have a general sense of what the new estimated date for the regional authority may be in 2021?,52,,
277,0.97,35004.736,35004.97,Yeah.,53,,
278,0.97,35004.97,35011.343,"As the deputy Mayor mentioned, we'll cover a number of topics in this presentation.",53,,
279,0.97,35011.343,35016.781,And the Kings County regional homeless authority is one of those topics.,53,,
280,0.97,35016.781,35038.67,"So I plan to review the Standup activities that have occurred to date, the time line for hiring a Ceo, the delay of both the transition of investments and staffing to an unknown date, at this point, which--but I plan on going into those details later on in the presentation.",53,,
281,0.97,35038.67,35038.803,.,53,,
282,0.97,35038.803,35039.371,That's helpful.,54,,
283,0.97,35039.371,35041.773,Thank you for pulling that up.,54,,
284,0.97,35041.773,35044.709,I know you have a slide toward the end.,54,,
285,0.97,35044.709,35048.913,I just wanted to Orient us as to when and if that may happen.,54,,
286,0.97,35048.913,35050.949,It sounds like you'll cover it in detail.,54,,
287,0.97,35050.949,35054.619,Thank you for highlighting that as a framing piece.,54,,
288,0.97,35054.919,35068.4,"Councilmember Gonzcez, did you have anything to add?",54,,
289,0.97,35068.4,35072.07,Just that Jason is going to cover it a little bit later.,55,,
290,0.97,35072.07,35085.65,"There has been as a reminder to colleagues, Councilmember Lewis and I serve representing the Seattle city council on the King County regional homeless authority governing committee.",55,,
291,0.97,35085.65,35086.785,That's a mouthful.,55,,
292,0.97,35086.785,35095.894,And we have had lots of conversations in public meetings about some of these delays.,55,,
293,0.97,35095.894,35096.628,I would say it's two-fold.,55,,
294,0.97,35096.628,35107.205,One is certainly because of the need to shift resources over the Covid and the regional response to that.,55,,
295,0.97,35107.205,35118.049,But there's also been some delay related to finding the search for the Ceo.,55,,
296,0.97,35118.049,35138.269,And there were issues related to the lived experience folks not having the infrastructure in terms of staffing and resources needed in order for them to continue to meaningfully engage in some of the important issues moving forward.,55,,
297,0.97,35138.269,35148.98,All of that to mean that there is a mixture of factors that have led to a little bit of delay in terms of setting up the Rha.,55,,
298,0.97,35148.98,35162.927,But I continue to have confidence that we're on the right track and on the right path to being able to do that pretty close to when the original time line was set.,55,,
299,0.97,35162.927,35182.814,"So we're hoping that sometime within the first quarter, in fact, of 2021 we'll be able to have a clearer sense of who the leader will be for the King County regional homelessness authority, which is the next step that we need to take in order to really stand up that effort.",55,,
300,0.97,35182.814,35192.924,"If I misstated anything or overstated something, director Johnson will be at the ready to provide United States additional details.",55,,
301,0.97,35192.924,35193.191,Thank you.,55,,
302,0.97,35193.191,35203.735,"Thank you very much, and thank you for representing us along with Councilmember Lewis on the Rha and for that framing.",56,,
303,0.97,35203.735,35204.536,That's helpful context.,56,,
304,0.97,35204.536,35205.97,Appreciate it.,56,,
305,0.97,35205.97,35206.171,Okay.,56,,
306,0.97,35206.171,35206.771,"Director Johnson, back to you.",56,,
307,0.97,35206.905,35207.138,Great.,57,,
308,0.97,35207.138,35207.572,Thank you so much.,57,,
309,0.97,35207.572,35207.972,And good morning.,57,,
310,0.97,35207.972,35210.375,Good to be with you.,57,,
311,0.97,35210.375,35221.186,"First, I want to acknowledge that there's a change to how we have packaged this year's budget by program area.",57,,
312,0.97,35221.186,35233.665,So you'll be seeing this sort of packaged differently than you have in 2020 or years past.,57,,
313,0.97,35233.665,35248.446,"In 2020 and previous years, Hsd budgeted the budget for homeless investment Bucketed into three programs, shelter and housing, homeless prevention and support, and the navigation team.",57,,
314,0.97,35248.446,35260.458,"In 2021, the budget will be reorganized to address the transition of homeless services to the King County regional homeless authority and show the budget that will remain.",57,,
315,0.97,35260.458,35268.266,"So what you'll see here, there are four program areas within Hsd's addressing homelessness level.",57,,
316,0.97,35268.266,35275.173,Three will stay with the city of Seattle and be administered by the human services Department.,57,,
317,0.97,35275.173,35286.684,"Those include City-Managed homeless programs such as health care for the homeless, which is funded through our contract with public health.",57,,
318,0.97,35286.684,35289.587,Housing opportunities for people living with AIDS.,57,,
319,0.97,35289.587,35300.865,This is a Federal grant that is managed by the human services Department currently and will continue to be managed by the Department.,57,,
320,0.97,35300.865,35307.705,And also funding to support operations of the housing Connector program.,57,,
321,0.97,35307.705,35314.312,"So, you know, just a small number of programs that will continue to be managed inside the Department.",57,,
322,0.97,35314.312,35316.748,I wanted to call those out here.,57,,
323,0.97,35316.748,35324.222,There will be some contract oversight and administration budget.,57,,
324,0.97,35324.222,35330.762,"Hsd administration, that's staffing and internal operations.",57,,
325,0.97,35330.762,35348.012,"We will continue to hold the addressing homelessness budget and will--when the regional authority is ready, enter into a contract for majority of our contracts and investments to homelessness with the regional authority.",57,,
326,0.97,35348.012,35357.388,"And we need a team to stay in the human services to manage those contracts, manage that relationship with the regional authority.",57,,
327,0.97,35357.388,35367.198,And to be in partnership and planning the city's investments and the city's efforts to address homelessness with the regional authority.,57,,
328,0.97,35367.198,35371.202,"And then also, unsheltered outreach and response.",57,,
329,0.97,35371.202,35378.509,So this is a homeless outreach team that we will talk about in a slide to come.,57,,
330,0.97,35378.509,35380.445,And this is $1.3 million to support that outreach team.,57,,
331,0.97,35380.445,35387.919,And this is also the PDA's lead contract.,57,,
332,0.97,35387.919,35392.623,That contract totalling $6.2 million will continue to be managed by the human services Department.,57,,
333,0.97,35392.623,35403.167,The King County regional homeless authority program shows the budget that will be contracted to this new entity when it becomes operational in 2021.,57,,
334,0.97,35403.167,35418.216,"So as I mentioned, Hsd will hold a contract with the regional authority for program investments and regional authority administration, staffing and operations.",57,,
335,0.97,35418.216,35434.332,"The full budget, which again, includes administration, contracts, and one-time Covid funds will all be sent to the regional authority when it's ready via a contract between the regional authority and the city.",57,,
336,0.97,35434.332,35447.678,"Of the $120.4 million budgeted in 2021, $39.3 million is one-time Covid funds.",57,,
337,0.97,35447.678,35450.448,$81.1 million is the base funding.,57,,
338,0.97,35450.448,35460.158,It's important to call this out because the $120 million is not something that can be sustained at this point.,57,,
339,0.97,35460.158,35475.106,"And I just want to recognize that the roughly $80 million, $81.1 million, is the base fund amount that we can expect to continue and be contracted with the regional authority over a longer period of time.",57,,
340,0.97,35475.106,35488.619,"So today we'll focus on, as Julie mentioned, some of the changes occurring, either from the budget or policy perspective.",57,,
341,0.97,35488.619,35499.463,"And those focus areas will really center on shelter, outreach, Covid-19 response, and the King County regional homeless authority.",57,,
342,0.97,35499.463,35506.504,Because these programs really have a large budget and program changes we want to go through with you.,57,,
343,0.97,35506.504,35507.371,All right.,57,,
344,0.97,35507.371,35510.341,Next slide.,57,,
345,0.97,35510.641,35517.815,Okay.,57,,
346,0.97,35518.583,35529.393,"So this slide, there is a $45.15 million increase to the homelessness budget.",57,,
347,0.97,35529.393,35534.765,"As mentioned, $39.3 of this is one-time emergency Covid-19 response resources.",57,,
348,0.97,35534.765,35538.269,$10 million of that is city Covid relief.,57,,
349,0.97,35538.269,35542.974,That includes $8 million in rent assistance.,57,,
350,0.97,35542.974,35549.247,And $2 million for Shelte provider support.,57,,
351,0.97,35549.247,35552.216,There is $23.5 million in Esg.,57,,
352,0.97,35552.216,35559.123,"As Julie mentioned, $3 million of this $26 million grant is going to be allocated in 2020.",57,,
353,0.97,35559.123,35572.303,And then $5.9 million of this $39.3 million is coming from the community development block.,57,,
354,0.97,35572.303,35580.111,And this budget includes $2.75 in ongoing general fund to support shelter programs.,57,,
355,0.97,35580.111,35592.056,It also includes $1.5 million to continue one-time funded programs that were funded in 2020 with one-time funding.,57,,
356,0.97,35592.056,35594.659,We're continuing $1.5 million worth of those programs.,57,,
357,0.97,35594.659,35607.071,"And those are, you know, for example, the programs such as homeless center operations, homeless shelter programs, as well as homeless outreach.",57,,
358,0.97,35607.071,35616.714,"And then Finally, this includes $1.6 million to provide the 1.9% contract inflation rate.",57,,
359,0.97,35616.714,35631.095,"I mentioned this yesterday, but important to state that this inflation area adjustment will transfer to the King County regional homeless authority when we transition those contracts over to the regional authority.",57,,
360,0.97,35631.095,35651.582,"So important to just restate that the 1.9% contract inflation rate will be added to Hsd contracts and those contract amounts will be Transitioned over to the King County regional authority, including the contract inflation.",57,,
361,0.97,35651.582,35658.155,"Dr. Johnson, I want to say thank you for including this, but for highlighting it.",58,,
362,0.97,35658.155,35666.864,I think your clarification today and yesterday should put at ease many of the concerns that I have heard.,58,,
363,0.97,35666.864,35668.899,And you have been exceptionally clear.,58,,
364,0.97,35668.899,35671.068,Thank you for making that comment public again.,58,,
365,0.97,35671.068,35686.217,And I do think that this is a really important way for us to help create stability in the organizations and address the cost of living in our area for some of the service providers that we know are on the lower end of the wage scale.,58,,
366,0.97,35686.217,35688.019,We really appreciate it.,58,,
367,0.97,35688.019,35690.388,And the skills are incredibly value.,58,,
368,0.97,35690.388,35690.654,Thank you.,58,,
369,0.97,35690.654,35690.988,Thank you.,59,,
370,0.97,35690.988,35692.656,I appreciate your leadership on this issue.,59,,
371,0.97,35692.656,35711.175,"So we're also transferring $976,000 of budget from the navigation team to the safe and thriving communities division, along with four positions Repurposed in the new division.",59,,
372,0.97,35711.175,35716.614,There were also some reductions.,59,,
373,0.97,35716.614,35720.484,$1.3 million in reductions to meet city budget constraints.,59,,
374,0.97,35720.484,35724.455,There is a reduction to the continuum of care administrative funding.,59,,
375,0.97,35724.455,35732.196,"This is funding that supports all home staffing, supports our homeless management information system, and coordinated entry.",59,,
376,0.97,35732.196,35739.136,And there was a reduction to the parking mitigation program.,59,,
377,0.97,35739.136,35745.276,There was one-time funding for the program in 2020 that we are not continuing in 2021.,59,,
378,0.97,35745.276,35765.763,"In 2021, the part-time outreach staff, case management, and financial assistance for this parking mitigation program will be merged into the urban League general outreach contract.",59,,
379,0.97,35765.763,35775.272,"Again, not the funding, but the programming that is in place through our contract with the urban League.",59,,
380,0.97,35775.272,35780.544,This should streamline activities and reduce administrative cost and service duplication.,59,,
381,0.97,35780.544,35784.548,There have been operational difficulties between parties.,59,,
382,0.97,35784.548,35793.758,"And to date, the program has not contributed to housing outcomes or referrals into safe parking programs.",59,,
383,0.97,35793.758,35802.6,"The activities funded through the $100,000 contract do not directly add to those outcomes.",59,,
384,0.97,35802.6,35807.037,"And therefore, should not result in a service reduction.",59,,
385,0.97,35807.037,35818.082,I want to highlight that the '21 budget has seven vacant positions.,59,,
386,0.97,35818.082,35830.261,These seven vacant positions in the homeless strategy and investment division are part of the overall budget reduction in the homelessness BSL.,59,,
387,0.97,35830.261,35832.363,Next slide.,59,,
388,0.97,35832.363,35836.333,Okay.,59,,
389,0.97,35836.333,35852.683,So the $41.3 million in regional investments to meet public health and CDC guidelines and reduce the spread of Covid-19.,59,,
390,0.97,35852.683,35866.564,"With $38.3 million in one-time funding, we have been able to really focus on reducing the spread of Covid-19 among our homeless neighbors and through the shelter network.",59,,
391,0.97,35866.564,35872.603,"We were, as you recall this year, able to open 95 new shelter units in the spring.",59,,
392,0.97,35872.603,35882.513,"And we relocated over 350 beds to Deintensify the shelter spaces, congregate shelter spaces.",59,,
393,0.97,35882.513,35887.918,We were able to maintain shelter services and contract flexibility.,59,,
394,0.97,35887.918,35895.659,"We did this through, I think, the best example of this is the partnership we had with King County to shelter people in hotels.",59,,
395,0.97,35895.659,35905.97,"Hsd changed our contracts to allow city service dollars to follow clients who were sheltered in hotel rooms, often outside of Seattle.",59,,
396,0.97,35905.97,35921.885,"That flexibility that we were able to make available to providers in partnership with King County really allowed that hotel effort, that regional hotel effort to be successful.",59,,
397,0.97,35921.885,35930.694,We helped providers create safer spaces and maintain changes through the pandemic and increased prevention and rental assistance.,59,,
398,0.97,35930.694,35935.733,Council has already voted on or seen all of these investments.,59,,
399,0.97,35935.733,35950.481,But it's important to highlight that the efforts that are in the 2021 budget really build on the work that was conducted this year during the pandemic.,59,,
400,0.97,35950.481,35962.526,I do also want to just highlight that there are $3 million to stand up new con congregate shelter and hotel capacity.,59,,
401,0.97,35962.526,35973.504,We mentioned that $3 million of the $26 million Esg grant is going to be used in 2020.,59,,
402,0.97,35973.504,35981.078,"And you know, this is a new investment for--that will begin in 2020.",59,,
403,0.97,35981.078,35992.456,And this should add new shelter capacity in some hotel rooms that we expect to be Online by the end of 2020.,59,,
404,0.97,35992.456,35995.025,The city is looking at partnerships to host shelters.,59,,
405,0.97,35995.025,36005.536,And we were able to make that announcement of the new shelter capacity just yesterday.,59,,
406,0.97,36005.536,36016.814,It's critical to continue to support agencies in sustaining these changes in 2021 so that our community can safely shelter people experiencing homelessness through the pandemic.,59,,
407,0.97,36016.814,36024.154,And we'll go into a little bit more detail in future slides about what that looks like.,59,,
408,0.97,36024.154,36052.016,But I think that what you're seeing from the Mayor's 2021 budget and what the human services Department has been working on and working on in close partnership with all of our community providers is that we have currently a shelter system that has just under 1500 beds.,59,,
409,0.97,36052.016,36054.885,"To be specific, 1479 shelter beds.",59,,
410,0.97,36054.885,36061.825,We expect to have just over 1700 beds available by the end of 2020.,59,,
411,0.97,36061.825,36063.761,These are not all Online at this point.,59,,
412,0.97,36063.761,36066.697,But we do expect to create additional shelter capacity.,59,,
413,0.97,36066.697,36071.535,The 2021 budget--.,59,,
414,0.97,36071.535,36072.269,Director--.,60,,
415,0.97,36072.269,36084.181,"-- building on these amounts and will add more hotel units, more rapid Rehousing vouchers, and more diversion investments.",61,,
416,0.97,36084.181,36118.749,"Overall, it's important to know that the '21 budget calls out an intentional effort to maintain what we're doing during the Covid pandemic, build additional shelter capacity so that we can get our unsheltered neighbors indoors safely, and build on opportunities to Uncrease out of shelter and into housing through the addition of rapid Rehousing and an intentional connection to the permanent support of housing units.",61,,
417,0.97,36118.882,36120.117,"Director Johnson, thank you.",62,,
418,0.97,36120.117,36130.461,"Before we transition to the slides on 2021, just wanted to follow up on a question that I asked director noble on Wednesday.",62,,
419,0.97,36130.461,36134.064,And it might be a more appropriate question for this presentation.,62,,
420,0.97,36134.064,36141.872,I did have a question come from some community partners about the $26.5 million in New C.A.R.E.S.,62,,
421,0.97,36141.872,36156.286,Act funding and a concern that they wanted to know how front line providers might be involved in the conversation about thousand allocate the dollars to the expanse for shelter.,62,,
422,0.97,36156.286,36157.654,Is that reflected here?,62,,
423,0.97,36157.654,36159.089,It is reflected here.,63,,
424,0.97,36159.089,36172.803,"And I would say that that process has been a continued dialogue and conversation between Diana Salazar, who is on with us today.",63,,
425,0.97,36172.803,36177.374,She is is division director for the homeless strategy and Invesment division.,63,,
426,0.97,36177.374,36186.083,She and her team have been in continuous dialogue with our contracted agency providers.,63,,
427,0.97,36186.083,36207.538,"And, you know, starting in March, it has been a very intentional effort to be in dialogue with our Community-Based organizations to--so that we can understand what their needs are, understand and support changes that they needed to make to programming to make spaces safe.",63,,
428,0.97,36207.538,36220.35,To make sure that they had the Ppe that they needed to ensure that services such as food delivery and others are in place.,63,,
429,0.97,36220.35,36231.094,And so there has been a continuous engagement with community providers as we have--the Covid-19 pandemic.,63,,
430,0.97,36231.094,36247.244,"I would say specifically about looking forward and looking into 2021, that conversation really started through the Rfp that took place in allocating 2021 Covid emergency response dollars.",63,,
431,0.97,36247.244,36256.086,And that effort was a very intentional engagement with providers.,63,,
432,0.97,36256.086,36265.929,"And it was really trying to look at program by program, shelter by shelter, what needs do you have currently?",63,,
433,0.97,36265.929,36273.704,"What expenses have you already, you know, used in order to make sure that the guests at each shelter are safe.",63,,
434,0.97,36273.704,36282.145,"And looking at the future, what is needed to continue or maintain and sustain those efforts?",63,,
435,0.97,36282.145,36290.387,"Likewise, what additional ideas, what additional help would be needed to build on the success that we have had in 2020?",63,,
436,0.97,36290.387,36292.99,And so I'm really proud of Diana and her team.,63,,
437,0.97,36292.99,36306.436,"They have done an incredible job to stay in communication with the contract providers, to stay in daily communication with the folks at King County Department of community and human services.",63,,
438,0.97,36306.436,36310.474,And to stay in regular communication with public health.,63,,
439,0.97,36310.474,36317.08,So I would say the engagement is deep.,63,,
440,0.97,36317.08,36318.582,It is continuous.,63,,
441,0.97,36318.582,36319.049,"It is daily, weekly.",63,,
442,0.97,36319.049,36323.253,And so I hope that answers the question.,63,,
443,0.97,36323.253,36330.927,But I see the engagement that has been taking place as one that is ever present.,63,,
444,0.97,36331.061,36335.632,"Thank you, director Johnson.",64,,
445,0.97,36335.632,36339.903,I appreciate that there has been regular engagement.,64,,
446,0.97,36339.903,36355.552,"I guess what I'm hearing from stake holders is concern that it hasn't been a coordinated body to identify what was needed early, how do we invest in holes in the system and coordinate among entities.",64,,
447,0.97,36355.552,36362.659,I flagged that and perhaps it's a conversation to have Offline with Ms. Salazar and yourself.,64,,
448,0.97,36362.659,36370.901,"Again, this is not necessarily an area that I have Purview over.",64,,
449,0.97,36370.901,36403.667,"But when it relates to the budget, if there's a coordination effort or investment we need to make for the community partners so there's a table getting the feedback to you and having the front line providers give Realtime and real life experience about the need, especially as Covid continues to spike this fall, I think hearing some of those concerns makes me ask the question about whether or not there's anything else we need to do in the budget to support the coordination and the engagement.",64,,
450,0.97,36403.667,36409.473,If there's a way to make it more coordinated is the concern that I'm hearing.,64,,
451,0.97,36409.473,36409.706,Yeah.,65,,
452,0.97,36409.706,36409.973,Thank you.,65,,
453,0.97,36409.973,36421.385,And I think there's always more that we can do to be better coordinated with our community partners and with King County.,65,,
454,0.97,36421.385,36434.931,The director of Dchs and I last year really stood up a forum with executive directors of contracted agencies in the city and outside of the city.,65,,
455,0.97,36434.931,36448.879,"And, you know, this--in spring, we really had to pivot from a conversation about the regional authority to continuous conversations about our response to Covid-19.",65,,
456,0.97,36448.879,36458.555,And Leo and I have reconvened that group specifically around the regional authority.,65,,
457,0.97,36458.555,36465.962,And I think that's a really good space for these regional conversations to take place.,65,,
458,0.97,36465.962,36468.732,We did hold a meeting last month.,65,,
459,0.97,36468.732,36472.669,We talked at a pretty high level about Esg specifically.,65,,
460,0.97,36472.669,36494.958,And what I can share with you is the strategies for how we are going to be using Esg as outlined in the 2021 budget that the city of Seattle is in alignment with how the county is going to be using their Esg dollars in 2021.,65,,
461,0.97,36494.958,36504.067,So really focused on Noncongregate Shelterment.,65,,
462,0.97,36504.067,36510.674,And focusing on the rapid Rehousing and housing throughput out of shelters.,65,,
463,0.97,36510.674,36511.608,Vice chair Herbold?,66,,
464,0.97,36511.608,36511.741,.,66,,
465,0.97,36511.741,36512.075,Thank you.,67,,
466,0.97,36512.075,36534.564,"Director Johnson, last time you and I spoke about adding Noncongregate shelter, Hoteling, I recall you telling me that the most significant challenge in the city doing more to support that model was staffing in our provider community.",67,,
467,0.97,36534.564,36541.004,Can you talk a little bit about that and how you think we'll be able to address it?,67,,
468,0.97,36541.004,36541.338,Thank you.,68,,
469,0.97,36541.338,36544.608,"It is something I am always, always worried about.",68,,
470,0.97,36544.608,36555.752,I know that especially this year during this Covid-19 pandemic our Community-Based organizations are stretched.,68,,
471,0.97,36555.752,36581.845,"And, you know, as we looked at our response to Covid, as we looked to the short-term, but important response to air quality and climate change, again, as we continuously engage with our Community-Based partners, we're hearing from them that they are really at capacity.",68,,
472,0.97,36581.845,36613.41,"And so what we're going to do in relation to these new shelter efforts and I'll go into a little bit more detail about exactly what those efforts will look like, but there is--we're going to ask, so, you know, typically we run an Rfp, sometimes Rfps can be a lengthy process.",68,,
473,0.97,36613.41,36624.387,"But we're going to conduct an expedited proposal gathering process to say, Okay, you know, we want to add capacity to shelter.",68,,
474,0.97,36624.387,36628.458,Who has the availability and expertise to be the service providers in those spaces?,68,,
475,0.97,36628.458,36640.904,"So it is something, as I discussed with you, you know, quite openly and Transparently, that I am worried about.",68,,
476,0.97,36640.904,36642.505,"Again, the provider community is stretched.",68,,
477,0.97,36642.505,36645.942,And we have asked a lot of them.,68,,
478,0.97,36645.942,36651.748,They have really stepped up and continue to do amazing work.,68,,
479,0.97,36651.748,36663.059,"But we need to, once again, ask for their help and see who is in a position, with additional resources, to step in and be is service providers of these new shelters.",68,,
480,0.97,36663.36,36666.496,.,68,,
481,0.97,36666.896,36667.497,Thank you.,69,,
482,0.97,36667.497,36669.566,"Director Johnson, thank you.",69,,
483,0.97,36669.566,36669.933,Please continue.,69,,
484,0.97,36669.933,36670.066,.,69,,
485,0.97,36670.066,36670.367,Yeah.,70,,
486,0.97,36670.367,36684.514,"I think the next slide, I'm handing things over to director Hara to talk about the Covid-19 response as it relates to hygiene services.",70,,
487,0.97,36684.514,36684.781,Hello.,71,,
488,0.97,36684.781,36689.552,Thank you for the opportunity to speak about the Covid-Related hygiene response.,71,,
489,0.97,36689.552,36698.161,"During the pandemic response, the city had to close or curtail hours at several facilities that offered public Restrooms.",71,,
490,0.97,36698.161,36717.614,"Understanding the importance of public health during the pandemic and an outbreak of hepatitis a, we placed stations throughout Seattle of a Restroom, Compliant Restroom, and hand washing stations.",71,,
491,0.97,36717.614,36723.753,We work with the park and vendors to clean the facilities twice a day.,71,,
492,0.97,36723.753,36725.321,The types of hand washing stations.,71,,
493,0.97,36725.321,36739.402,"On the heels of the work, we designed and ordered 15 hand washing stations with larger storage tanks to allow us to save on costs.",71,,
494,0.97,36739.402,36748.611,"Each station cost $11,000 to rent per year, for a total of $170,000 for all of the stations.",71,,
495,0.97,36748.611,36752.115,"It will cost approximately $120,000 to purchase all 15 stations.",71,,
496,0.97,36752.115,36754.918,We estimate the break even point at eight months.,71,,
497,0.97,36754.918,36757.72,The last 13 stations should be delivered before the end of the year.,71,,
498,0.97,36757.72,36765.295,And we want to thank Patiences and Hsd for their leadership and partnership on the work.,71,,
499,0.97,36765.295,36774.704,The Mayor's 2021 proposed budget includes $1.5 million of new budget for this program.,71,,
500,0.97,36774.704,36779.642,"Additionally, the shower trailers supplement the open supply of showers.",71,,
501,0.97,36779.642,36790.12,We are providing services at King Street station and two others and looking to re-establish a site at the University strict.,71,,
502,0.97,36790.12,36797.06,Weekly shower accounts increasing at a rate of 6% per week since the beginning of June.,71,,
503,0.97,36797.06,36806.536,"At this point, from September 22nd through September 28th, for that model weeks, we averaged over 120 showers per day.",71,,
504,0.97,36806.536,36818.781,"And through September 28th, we have provided more than 8,500 showers to people experiencing homelessness and estimate we will provide more than 17,000 showers by December.",71,,
505,0.97,36818.781,36825.121,"And this effort is a partnership that includes the Department of neighborhoods, Hsd parks, and Spu.",71,,
506,0.97,36825.121,36837.534,And I want to mention that we partnered with a global and historically African American fraternity at the University of Washington.,71,,
507,0.97,36837.534,36841.171,They gathered clean clothes and gave them to people experiencing homelessness.,71,,
508,0.97,36841.171,36844.641,We hope for further partnership and donations in this area of great need.,71,,
509,0.97,36844.641,36850.68,"Over time, we have brought the cost of rental for showers down to $50 a day per stall.",71,,
510,0.97,36850.68,36859.155,And we are currently Transitioning to an ownership model that will allow for a break even point after about five to six months of ownership.,71,,
511,0.97,36859.155,36870.667,"As with the SINKS, we couldn't find a model reliable to meet the volume and needs of guests.",71,,
512,0.97,36870.667,36875.471,The prototype is currently in production.,71,,
513,0.97,36875.471,36883.613,The Mayor's budget includes approximately $4.8 million of new budget for this program.,71,,
514,0.97,36883.613,36894.691,"And Lastly, the 2021 budget maintains $2 million in funding for cleanup work supporting the folks remaining unsheltered.",71,,
515,0.97,36894.691,36900.897,They are Rv remediation program and litter abatement and needle pickup programs.,71,,
516,0.97,36900.897,36904.834,And it transfers $1.3 million from FAS to manage a cleanup contract.,71,,
517,0.97,36904.834,36910.373,"As a transfer, the funding is not included in our tally of new money.",71,,
518,0.97,36910.373,36918.915,The use of the transferred funds will include supporting cleaning on difficult terrain and hazardous waste and materials collection and disposal.,71,,
519,0.97,36918.915,36919.182,Thank you.,71,,
520,0.97,36919.315,36922.185,"Thank you very much, director Hara.",72,,
521,0.97,36922.185,36925.388,I think there might be a few questions.,72,,
522,0.97,36925.388,36929.459,"Two that I have, very briefly.",72,,
523,0.97,36929.459,36932.195,You mentioned looking to expand in the University district.,72,,
524,0.97,36932.195,36939.636,"I believe I heard that was included, correct, in the 2021 budget for a hygiene center there?",72,,
525,0.97,36939.636,36939.769,.,72,,
526,0.97,36939.769,36942.205,It is.,73,,
527,0.97,36942.205,36946.309,We are looking to include University heights.,73,,
528,0.97,36946.309,36946.542,Okay.,74,,
529,0.97,36946.542,36946.91,Thank you.,74,,
530,0.97,36946.91,36957.32,I know there's a few folks who would like to speak.,74,,
531,0.97,36957.32,36958.521,Councilmember Morales?,74,,
532,0.97,36958.521,36959.088,And Councilmember her bolt.,74,,
533,0.97,36959.222,36963.026,Herbold.,74,,
534,0.97,36963.026,36965.628,We cannot hear you.,75,,
535,0.97,36965.628,36966.496,Is that better?,76,,
536,0.97,36966.496,36968.364,Yes.,77,,
537,0.97,36968.364,36970.233,I have a quick question.,78,,
538,0.97,36970.233,36974.103,How many Encampments does the purple bag program serve?,78,,
539,0.97,36974.103,36983.479,And can you talk about whether there is a path forward for regular trash pickup similar to what regular residential services are?,78,,
540,0.97,36983.479,36989.919,"And if so, how much would such a service cost?",78,,
541,0.97,36989.919,36991.888,Sure.,79,,
542,0.97,36991.888,36996.559,I'll start the answer and ask for further detail.,79,,
543,0.97,36996.559,37001.464,"Overall, we have served 51 Unsanctioned Encampments with the purple bag program.",79,,
544,0.97,37001.464,37008.938,We currently have a regular roster of 17 sites that we are serving with the program.,79,,
545,0.97,37008.938,37020.95,"I believe that the cost of expanding the program would be approximately $15,000 per site per year for the collection and outreach activities.",79,,
546,0.97,37020.95,37026.155,And that would include the services from the hepatitis education project.,79,,
547,0.97,37026.155,37030.593,Would you like to add details Úthat I may have gotten wrong or missed?,79,,
548,0.97,37030.727,37040.236,Good morning.,80,,
549,0.97,37040.236,37054.784,You captured that well in relation to the question of the path moving forward about providing a more Sablized type of trash mitigation service as residential homes receive.,80,,
550,0.97,37054.784,37065.661,That would be something we would have to take a deeper dive into compared to the purple trash bag program.,80,,
551,0.97,37065.661,37069.699,"We have contractors going in, outreach contractors, to provide those services.",80,,
552,0.97,37069.699,37075.171,So something down the road we can look at more in depth if that's something you would like us to do.,80,,
553,0.97,37075.471,37075.972,.,80,,
554,0.97,37082.745,37085.014,Councilmember Morales?,81,,
555,0.97,37085.014,37086.082,Yes.,82,,
556,0.97,37086.082,37094.223,"And has the city looked at opening new permanent spaces or expanding, for example, urban rest stop services?",82,,
557,0.97,37094.223,37094.857,And why or why not?,82,,
558,0.97,37094.857,37095.491,Thank you.,82,,
559,0.97,37095.625,37108.538,I don't know if other Department directors would like to jump into this answer about the permanent hygiene facilities.,83,,
560,0.97,37108.538,37118.681,We have definitely had a lot of planning discussions around the use of existing facilities or the expansion of permanent facilities.,83,,
561,0.97,37118.681,37122.919,And we would look forward to further engagement on the issue.,83,,
562,0.97,37123.052,37127.457,"Good morning, Hi, it's Jason.",84,,
563,0.97,37127.457,37154.016,"I wanted to highlight that the current support for hygiene services such as those offered through the urban rest stop and hygiene services inside of centers, you know, our shelters are included in the $120 million that you'll see in the King County regional homeless authority.",84,,
564,0.97,37154.016,37154.684,In the dollar amount.,84,,
565,0.97,37154.684,37160.823,"At this point, we have not expanded those services.",84,,
566,0.97,37160.823,37167.363,"But through the 2021 budget, we were able to hold harmless any reductions or cuts to those programs.",84,,
567,0.97,37167.663,37169.432,.,84,,
568,0.97,37180.543,37181.01,Councilmember Morales?,85,,
569,0.97,37181.01,37181.21,No.,86,,
570,0.97,37181.21,37186.349,Councilmember Herbold.,87,,
571,0.97,37186.349,37187.617,Thank you.,88,,
572,0.97,37187.617,37191.587,"Good to see you, director Hara, and good to hear you address.",88,,
573,0.97,37191.587,37202.999,I appreciate the work you guys have been doing in developing this really important element as part of Spu's work.,88,,
574,0.97,37202.999,37206.903,"Very Nontraditional Pairing, but really appreciate that you stepped in to this area.",88,,
575,0.97,37206.903,37217.78,So important starting with the purple bag program and Rv remediation.,88,,
576,0.97,37217.78,37222.852,And now moving into these portable hygiene investments.,88,,
577,0.97,37222.852,37223.219,Just a question.,88,,
578,0.97,37223.219,37237.733,"We know that there has been a rental of mobile showers, as well as hand washing stations and Port-A-Potties.",88,,
579,0.97,37237.733,37244.507,What is the plan as envisioned by the Council at this time last year for the purchase of mobile pit stops?,88,,
580,0.97,37244.507,37257.853,I know there was of course an issue with one of the providers no longer constructing them.,88,,
581,0.97,37257.853,37260.122,They are not the only provider.,88,,
582,0.97,37260.122,37269.899,And do we envision a time at which we are going to move from renting these facilities to owning these facilities?,88,,
583,0.97,37269.899,37276.339,"And if so, does the 2021 budget include funding to staff and operate them?",88,,
584,0.97,37276.339,37276.872,That's my first question.,88,,
585,0.97,37276.872,37285.681,And my other question relates to permanent hand washing stations.,88,,
586,0.97,37285.681,37290.686,The slide notes that Spu is in the process of buying those.,88,,
587,0.97,37290.686,37296.025,Are they--is the idea to supplement the current stations and expand the number?,88,,
588,0.97,37296.025,37304.266,Or is this a replacement of one set that has been currently purchased?,88,,
589,0.97,37304.266,37309.372,"And Lastly, the budget includes $2 million for the cleanup work and $1.3 million to manage cleanup contract.",88,,
590,0.97,37309.372,37316.712,"Can you compare that level of not just funding, but the level of service to 2020 for us?",88,,
591,0.97,37316.712,37317.546,Thank you.,88,,
592,0.97,37317.68,37318.08,Sure.,89,,
593,0.97,37318.08,37322.051,I might have to ask you to repeat some of the questions.,89,,
594,0.97,37322.051,37328.658,"To start with the first one about moving to an ownership model, yes.",89,,
595,0.97,37328.658,37331.193,You used the term pit stop.,89,,
596,0.97,37331.193,37341.47,I don't know if that is synonymous with Showerer trailers that also include a bathroom unit or if you're thinking about something on a more expanded level.,89,,
597,0.97,37341.47,37348.511,Could you clarify that for me before I give you the wrong answer?,89,,
598,0.97,37348.511,37348.744,Sure.,90,,
599,0.97,37348.744,37355.785,"The mobile pit stop, a shower and bathroom unit.",90,,
600,0.97,37355.785,37375.237,"I think some of them might have--from my understanding, the provider that we were exploring last year, they are very much built to order.",90,,
601,0.97,37375.237,37380.876,So they have the components that the folks buying them want them to have.,90,,
602,0.97,37380.876,37383.913,"But at minimum, they typically have showers and bathrooms.",90,,
603,0.97,37383.913,37394.09,A clarification I want to provide is the Council's spoke specifically to bathrooms and not the shower component.,91,,
604,0.97,37394.09,37397.293,I think that's an important operational distinction between the two.,91,,
605,0.97,37397.293,37400.663,Just for full disclosure.,91,,
606,0.97,37400.663,37402.331,Okay.,92,,
607,0.97,37402.465,37408.871,So we are moving to an ownership model with the shower trailers.,93,,
608,0.97,37408.871,37433.496,"As I noted in my comments, we have had a great deal of difficulty finding a prototype that meets the really robust needs that are generated from, you know, the high volume of folks who are now using the showers.",93,,
609,0.97,37433.496,37438.501,And a lot of the units that are available on the market just aren't built for that kind of use.,93,,
610,0.97,37438.501,37462.224,"So our planning and project design group actually Prototyped a new model and has been working with a local manufacturer to, you know, develop and test that prototype.",93,,
611,0.97,37462.224,37462.758,And we have ordered two.,93,,
612,0.97,37462.758,37476.605,"And we expect that once they are delivered that the payback period if you compare the cost of the new units to rental, they will be paid off within somewhere between five to six months.",93,,
613,0.97,37476.605,37483.045,They should provide a very good value and provide much better service to the folks that we are helping.,93,,
614,0.97,37483.045,37486.749,That's fantastic news.,94,,
615,0.97,37486.749,37487.016,Thank you.,94,,
616,0.97,37487.016,37491.954,"The other two questions relate, one, about the hand washing stations.",94,,
617,0.97,37491.954,37500.029,"Are the purchase of new hand washing stations to supplement the current ones, or are we needing to replace old ones?",94,,
618,0.97,37500.029,37508.838,And the third question relates to the $2 million in the budget for cleanup work and $1.3 million to manage a cleanup contract.,94,,
619,0.97,37508.838,37514.41,Just the level of service compared to 2020 on that.,94,,
620,0.97,37514.543,37525.754,The 15 SINKS that we have Prototyped and have ordered will replace the existing SINKS.,95,,
621,0.97,37525.754,37529.859,But they are much bigger in terms of the volume that they hold.,95,,
622,0.97,37529.859,37534.363,And they are double--have double basins.,95,,
623,0.97,37534.363,37538.167,So they can have more use.,95,,
624,0.97,37538.167,37542.538,But they are not in addition to the ones that we are renting.,95,,
625,0.97,37542.538,37546.876,They are much more robust as well.,95,,
626,0.97,37546.876,37557.186,"For the additional money, the $1.3 in addition to the base funding, that money is to be spent in partnership--well, transfer money, apologies.",95,,
627,0.97,37557.186,37566.695,To be developed in partnership with parks to try to pilot additional cleanup within Encampments.,95,,
628,0.97,37566.695,37575.137,"As you are aware, we are--Spu manages all of the trash that is placed outside of Encampments.",95,,
629,0.97,37575.137,37579.141,And we do the perimeter for dumping and litter.,95,,
630,0.97,37579.141,37592.821,"Now that Encampments are on a longer basis, you know, and are not being moved, there's a lot more trash generated inside the Encampments.",95,,
631,0.97,37592.821,37597.66,Some of to sites are steep and have hazardous materials accumulating on them.,95,,
632,0.97,37597.66,37617.513,This would be an effort to remove hazardous materials from some of the sites and to also help to clean some of the really problematic terrain that some of the Encampments are on.,95,,
633,0.97,37617.513,37626.889,And there would be other outreach hits to make sure we are well within all of the rules and respecting the property rights of the people in the Encampments.,95,,
634,0.97,37627.022,37630.626,"Thank you very much, director.",96,,
635,0.97,37630.626,37633.028,"Let's move on, if that sounds good to folks.",96,,
636,0.97,37633.028,37633.228,Great.,96,,
637,0.97,37633.228,37634.396,Thank you.,96,,
638,0.97,37634.396,37634.53,.,96,,
639,0.97,37634.53,37634.863,Thank you.,97,,
640,0.97,37634.997,37638.701,Okay.,98,,
641,0.97,37638.701,37639.001,Next slide.,98,,
642,0.97,37639.001,37644.34,All right.,98,,
643,0.97,37644.34,37658.988,"So the Mayor's 2021 budget proposes $42.1 million in new funding to maintain existing shelters, keeping current capacity, and keeping alignment to CDC Covid guidelines in place.",98,,
644,0.97,37658.988,37672.701,"It also creates new shelters, adds the temporary use of hotel beds, and increases investments in rapid Rehousing and diversion.",98,,
645,0.97,37672.701,37677.806,Nearly all of these funds are one time.,98,,
646,0.97,37677.806,37693.088,"And except for the $2.75 million in general fund dollars, I just want to highlight the $2.75 million in general Fund are the only ongoing operational funds available in this budget.",98,,
647,0.97,37693.088,37694.957,All other funds are one time.,98,,
648,0.97,37694.957,37711.94,"The total investment in the program areas, so this is base funding versus emergency funding, is $94.4 million, nearly double the amount in the 2020 adopted budget.",98,,
649,0.97,37711.94,37722.918,"Our strategy is to maintain the current system of services, create more safe spaces, and move more people from homelessness to housing.",98,,
650,0.97,37722.918,37740.069,"You'll see that in these activities when we talk about maintaining, we're talking about $13.9 million to maintain current shelter capacity and meet public health and CDC guidelines for reducing the spread of Covid-19.",98,,
651,0.97,37740.069,37743.372,This also includes rental assistance and Eviction prevention investments.,98,,
652,0.97,37743.372,37749.812,"New or creating, this is $18.6 million.",98,,
653,0.97,37749.812,37760.055,This will help us stand up the temporary use of 300 hotel units.,98,,
654,0.97,37760.055,37763.292,This will launch 125 units of 24/7 enhanced shelter.,98,,
655,0.97,37763.292,37774.603,"And I think I mentioned this before, but just to restate, the shelter and some of the hotel units we expect to have open by the end of 2020.",98,,
656,0.97,37774.603,37797.993,"When I talk about this movement to housing, and often I talk about wanting to increase throughput to housing, this is really where this $9.6 million to increase investments in rapid Rehousing come into play.",98,,
657,0.97,37797.993,37804.7,We believe we can serve around 231 more households through additional funding in rapid Rehousing.,98,,
658,0.97,37804.7,37811.473,This is on top of the households currently served through the rapid Rehousing programs.,98,,
659,0.97,37811.473,37820.582,These are dollars that would be attached to the new shelter and hotel units.,98,,
660,0.97,37820.582,37827.089,And really create intentional throughput to those new safe spaces.,98,,
661,0.97,37827.089,37832.961,I'm often asked what rapid Rehousing is.,98,,
662,0.97,37832.961,37835.664,It is a rental voucher program.,98,,
663,0.97,37835.664,37849.344,"It is a successful housing program, housing voucher program, where case managers and clients work together to identify available rental housing.",98,,
664,0.97,37849.344,37853.015,Clients receive up to a year of rental assistance.,98,,
665,0.97,37853.015,37858.52,It is proven to be a successful program model here locally.,98,,
666,0.97,37858.52,37865.694,"In 2019, the rapid Rehousing program area had an 81% rate of exits to housing.",98,,
667,0.97,37865.694,37874.703,That means that folks were able to continue staying housed past the point of their voucher ending.,98,,
668,0.97,37874.703,37886.381,We often get questions about rapid Rehousing and whether it is--continues to be a successful model during the Covid-19 pandemic.,98,,
669,0.97,37886.381,37890.519,This program does continue to be successful during the pandemic.,98,,
670,0.97,37890.519,37902.464,"Though it is requiring longer durations of voucher use, and at times, requires the amount of rent or rapid Rehousing voucher covers.",98,,
671,0.97,37902.464,37906.602,So the cost of the voucher is going up.,98,,
672,0.97,37906.602,37921.683,"We would continue, you know, in 2020 and 2021, continue to monitor this and collaborate with rapid Rehousing agencies to problem solve with them.",98,,
673,0.97,37921.683,37935.831,"This number, the 231 households, that's a very conservative count or estimate of the number of households served through the voucher program.",98,,
674,0.97,37935.831,37942.571,This is making an Upfront assumption each household would need a longer assistance over a longer period of time.,98,,
675,0.97,37942.571,37946.508,"With the funds, we would be serving fewer households.",98,,
676,0.97,37946.508,37969.998,"If that changes and our assumptions are incorrect and people do not need the voucher for a longer duration of time or if the amount of an individual household's rent does not need to be fully covered by the voucher, we expect we can.",98,,
677,0.97,37969.998,37973.969,We're also going to be increasing investments in diversion.,98,,
678,0.97,37973.969,37982.744,We believe that in the 2021 budget we can serve 130 more households through diversion services.,98,,
679,0.97,37982.744,37987.282,These dollars will be attached to outreach.,98,,
680,0.97,37987.282,37990.552,"And likewise, I'm often asked what is diversion?",98,,
681,0.97,37990.552,37999.294,Diversion services help people bypass the emergency or crisis shelter system altogether and end their experience of homelessness.,98,,
682,0.97,37999.294,38006.234,"Outreach workers, case managers, and clients work together to identify solutions that meet the client's need.",98,,
683,0.97,38006.234,38013.008,"With diversion funding, folks can have first, last, housing paid.",98,,
684,0.97,38013.008,38024.086,"They can be offered one-time flexible funds to pay for a variety of items, small items such as items needed for a job.",98,,
685,0.97,38024.086,38034.93,"Or it can also pay for transportation, bus or plane tickets to reunite with family or friends or a job that will offer a place for the client to stay in another area.",98,,
686,0.97,38034.93,38062.023,"And then also important element of throughput to housing in 2021, not Hsd related, but the office of housing is standing up 600 units of permanent supportive housing to open in 2021.",98,,
687,0.97,38062.023,38070.232,"Though these aren't Hsd investments, it's important to highlight that the units will benefit people who rely on the homeless service system.",98,,
688,0.97,38070.232,38086.348,"The permanent supportive housing units are--will be directly attached to new shelter and hotel capacity, creating throughput to specialized housing for those individuals, those households staying in the temporary shelters.",98,,
689,0.97,38086.481,38089.484,Thank you very much for walking us through this.,99,,
690,0.97,38089.484,38093.455,You have a number of people who would like to ask questions.,99,,
691,0.97,38093.455,38098.059,And there is a lot of detail in slides nine and ten that we want to get to.,99,,
692,0.97,38098.059,38106.835,So I'll let folks know the order.,99,,
693,0.97,38106.835,38109.938,"Councilmember Lewis, Juarez, Morales, and Herbold.",99,,
694,0.97,38109.938,38110.138,Okay.,99,,
695,0.97,38110.138,38116.645,And we also have a presentation from the office of housing today.,99,,
696,0.97,38116.645,38119.881,"Again, hard stop at 1:00 P.M.",99,,
697,0.97,38119.881,38120.982,"Councilmember Lewis, go ahead.",99,,
698,0.97,38120.982,38126.822,"Given that we have the office of housing later, I'll ask this first.",100,,
699,0.97,38126.822,38137.065,"Director Johnson, the 600 units of permanent supportive housing, do you know if that is housing levy money or if the source is something else?",100,,
700,0.97,38137.065,38138.967,"If that's better for later, I can leave it at that.",100,,
701,0.97,38139.101,38142.838,Yeah.,101,,
702,0.97,38142.838,38147.876,I do expect that director Alvarado will dive into those details.,101,,
703,0.97,38147.876,38150.278,I think that question is best asked of her.,101,,
704,0.97,38150.412,38150.679,Okay.,102,,
705,0.97,38150.679,38150.879,Great.,102,,
706,0.97,38150.879,38169.464,"On the hotel, so the 300 hotel units, $15.8 million, just to clarify, what is the anticipated Sustainment of the 300 hotel units?",102,,
707,0.97,38169.464,38178.84,Like so how much time are we giving folks to stay Hoteled?,102,,
708,0.97,38178.84,38181.309,"You know, I know Hoteling is expensive.",102,,
709,0.97,38181.309,38188.416,But I would imagine we're going to get a fairly long stay for those 300 units.,102,,
710,0.97,38188.416,38193.522,But just curious if--what's being factored in in the per unit stay.,102,,
711,0.97,38193.522,38198.527,"Jason, do you want me to take that one?",103,,
712,0.97,38198.527,38198.827,Go ahead.,104,,
713,0.97,38198.827,38203.598,And Diane and I are here to fill in gaps.,104,,
714,0.97,38203.598,38210.005,The idea with the 300 units and recognizing it's one-time money.,105,,
715,0.97,38210.005,38214.709,What we are anticipating is trying to secure hotels for 10-month period of time.,105,,
716,0.97,38214.709,38236.064,"And again, you know, partly as Jason explained on the rapid Rehousing and the diversion money is, you know, looking at other jurisdictions, including King County, but also in California and elsewhere is where folks came into a hotel, there was not an exit plan for them.",105,,
717,0.97,38236.064,38238.4,And that was a problem.,105,,
718,0.97,38238.4,38249.144,"So applying those lessons learned here, as individuals come in to the hotel units, it is not the anticipation someone would be in a unit for the full ten months.",105,,
719,0.97,38249.144,38256.218,We are immediately working on exit plan for them to permanent housing.,105,,
720,0.97,38256.218,38263.291,The idea being it wouldn't just be the same 300 individuals other the ten months.,105,,
721,0.97,38263.291,38270.632,"We would be creating--by Pairing this with additional resource is throughput in the Ecosystem, if you will.",105,,
722,0.97,38270.632,38270.765,.,105,,
723,0.97,38270.765,38282.31,"So 300 units sustained for ten months with the idea that as people cycle out, more people would be cycle in to the units.",106,,
724,0.97,38282.31,38282.677,Correct.,107,,
725,0.97,38282.677,38290.418,And as the new 600 units come Online that we have also got as sort of a dove tail to the work.,107,,
726,0.97,38290.418,38307.035,"We start the process of bringing the people inside over the dark, cold, winter months and begin working Wih them immediately to get them placed in the new units or utilize other resources.",107,,
727,0.97,38307.035,38307.302,.,107,,
728,0.97,38307.302,38313.842,"So the 231 rapid Rehousing, the folks in the hotels would be eligible for those resources as well?",108,,
729,0.97,38313.842,38314.409,That is correct.,109,,
730,0.97,38314.409,38329.057,"I think it's an important point to make that on day one, we need to be having a housing conversation with each of these individuals.",109,,
731,0.97,38329.057,38334.129,And that housing conversation will include we have a temporary place for you to stay.,109,,
732,0.97,38334.129,38338.366,It's through the use of a hotel.,109,,
733,0.97,38338.366,38348.777,"But ultimately, we want to use rapid Rehousing, or if appropriate, permanent supportive housing as the long-term strategy for you.",109,,
734,0.97,38348.777,38367.228,And it may take many months for an individual to transition from a temporary location in one of the hotels to the market with the rapid Rehousing voucher or into a Permanen supportive housing unit as those come Online.,109,,
735,0.97,38367.228,38374.235,But this is a housing conversation that we want to have with individuals.,109,,
736,0.97,38374.235,38377.872,And there's really sort of a two-step process.,109,,
737,0.97,38377.872,38382.977,One that gets them immediately sheltered safely.,109,,
738,0.97,38382.977,38386.781,"And two, that gets them the resources they need to enter into housing.",109,,
739,0.97,38386.915,38390.685,Okay.,110,,
740,0.97,38390.685,38393.321,Thank you for that clarification.,110,,
741,0.97,38393.321,38403.431,"I guess to talk about the logistics anticipated here, would the idea be to contract with or lease a hotel somewhere?",110,,
742,0.97,38403.431,38411.172,Or would the idea be to do long-term rentals of a Bank of rooms?,110,,
743,0.97,38411.172,38414.709,How are we envisioning securing the 300 units?,110,,
744,0.97,38414.709,38420.982,"And how would that be divided up, presumably among multiple locations?",110,,
745,0.97,38420.982,38429.691,One of the things we're learning from other areas is site control is really important.,111,,
746,0.97,38429.691,38437.098,"It as with the staffing model that goes with this, which was asked about earlier.",111,,
747,0.97,38437.098,38442.704,"So I think in an ideal world, we would be able to lease whole hotels.",111,,
748,0.97,38442.704,38447.442,"Whether we are successful in doing that, S that's a different question.",111,,
749,0.97,38447.442,38450.478,We haven't begun to explore that process entirely yet.,111,,
750,0.97,38450.478,38454.349,"But if not that, blocks of rooms as well.",111,,
751,0.97,38454.349,38462.19,The idea being we can consolidate these rooms.,111,,
752,0.97,38462.19,38469.197,The more consolidate rather than peanut Buttered across the city is from a staffing model really important.,111,,
753,0.97,38469.197,38472.6,That's what we have heard from providers from day one.,111,,
754,0.97,38472.6,38477.172,And they are proving in a way that it's approached its work in Renton.,111,,
755,0.97,38477.305,38482.343,Thank you.,112,,
756,0.97,38482.343,38487.449,Koungsmembercouncilmember Juarez.,112,,
757,0.97,38487.449,38487.782,Thank you.,113,,
758,0.97,38487.782,38497.625,A lot of what the director Johnson said and deputy Sixkiller and Councilmember Lewis answered a lot of my questions.,113,,
759,0.97,38497.625,38500.862,"They were to the duration, the exit plan, and the 600 units.",113,,
760,0.97,38500.862,38511.105,So mine is a little bit more in general probably directed more to Jason.,113,,
761,0.97,38511.105,38527.222,"So if we're looking at hotel units to lease for ten months and this is one-time funds, correct, we're not looking at hotel units to buy?",113,,
762,0.97,38527.222,38529.09,That's correct.,114,,
763,0.97,38529.09,38542.47,This is a short-term or a temporary lease of hotel space to be used for 2021.,114,,
764,0.97,38542.47,38548.643,The Esg dollars do not allow for acquisition.,114,,
765,0.97,38548.643,38549.177,So--.,114,,
766,0.97,38549.177,38550.678,Yeah.,115,,
767,0.97,38550.678,38552.68,That was my next question.,115,,
768,0.97,38552.68,38560.388,"The limitation on that money not to buy hotels, but just to lease the units.",115,,
769,0.97,38560.388,38574.702,"So my next question is isn't it fair to say just from where we're sitting right now and the way we're living that Noncongregate living is the shape of policy to come, not only in the pandemic, but after?",115,,
770,0.97,38574.702,38585.446,That we can't go back to because we tried to move away from congregate living.,115,,
771,0.97,38585.446,38587.248,And then tiny houses.,115,,
772,0.97,38587.248,38588.182,Then permanent supportive housing.,115,,
773,0.97,38588.182,38597.458,I just feel that this is something that we have been Chases our tail around.,115,,
774,0.97,38597.458,38601.195,I know that Councilmember Herbold knows more.,115,,
775,0.97,38601.195,38602.263,Feel free to step in.,115,,
776,0.97,38602.263,38606.534,"But it seems to me, yes, it's great we have the C.A.R.E.S.",115,,
777,0.97,38606.534,38608.77,Act money coming in.,115,,
778,0.97,38608.77,38612.073,And some of it is one-time Federal money.,115,,
779,0.97,38612.073,38626.854,"Maybe we should start planning to look at the new policy of how we House people to stabilize them is buying hotels, not just leasing them for ten months.",115,,
780,0.97,38626.854,38630.558,Because I don't think this Úpandemic--I think it's going to be a while.,115,,
781,0.97,38630.558,38632.927,I don't know how you picked ten months.,115,,
782,0.97,38632.927,38636.431,I'm guessing it had to do with money.,115,,
783,0.97,38636.431,38637.532,And that may be more philosophical.,115,,
784,0.97,38637.532,38642.303,And I don't want to put you on the spot.,115,,
785,0.97,38642.303,38649.677,I'm trying to get a sense of where we're going with the homelessness and unsheltered.,115,,
786,0.97,38649.677,38654.749,"In my district alone, we have two parks--actually, six parks.",115,,
787,0.97,38654.749,38658.286,But I can't tell you enough what that's doing.,115,,
788,0.97,38658.286,38658.753,Because you all know.,115,,
789,0.97,38658.753,38686.481,"So when we have these community meetings and people are saying, well, yes, we can be welcoming to a tiny House village and permanent and supportive housing, and then we're working with the providers and the homeless providers who say a better way is yes, that's great to lease the units and I think you mentioned or I read you're calling it a shelter surge.",115,,
790,0.97,38686.481,38690.885,"I'm of the position that, you know, we need to do it going on a buying surge here.",115,,
791,0.97,38690.885,38706.501,"And look at the long-term benefits and effects of getting people in units that we actually own the hotel, but we transfer those over to service providers to stabilize people so they have somewhere to go.",115,,
792,0.97,38706.501,38710.605,But we also are responding to the pandemic.,115,,
793,0.97,38710.605,38715.109,"So again, Jason, I don't want to just put you on the spot.",115,,
794,0.97,38715.109,38720.081,I really want to have honest conversation and Exchange with you.,115,,
795,0.97,38720.081,38723.284,I'm not trying to do a got you thing.,115,,
796,0.97,38723.284,38723.618,Thank you.,116,,
797,0.97,38723.618,38726.087,I don't feel on the spot at all.,116,,
798,0.97,38726.087,38729.057,I love a lot of what you're highlighting.,116,,
799,0.97,38729.057,38738.032,"And you know, I don't feel like we have been chasing tail, but chasing best practice.",116,,
800,0.97,38738.032,38747.608,"The human services Department has been expanding enhanced shelter, 24/7 enhanced shelter, since 2017.",116,,
801,0.97,38747.608,38752.713,We can no longer accept just a mat on floor overnight only shelter model.,116,,
802,0.97,38752.713,38773.134,"And I believe that when we provide 24/7 space, provide dignity in that space where people have space to store their belongings, have enough room, especially important now for folks to have enough room.",116,,
803,0.97,38773.134,38778.906,And space that they can call their own and know that they can return tonight after night.,116,,
804,0.97,38778.906,38790.351,"So no longer lining up at 5:00, 6:00, 7:00 at night and being kicked out in the early morning.",116,,
805,0.97,38790.351,38790.618,Right.,117,,
806,0.97,38790.618,38797.959,But most importantly is having services attached that people can access during daytime hours.,118,,
807,0.97,38797.959,38807.335,And what we're seeing is there is a cost related to shelter enhancements.,118,,
808,0.97,38807.335,38808.236,Absolutely.,118,,
809,0.97,38808.236,38810.138,You double the cost of operations.,118,,
810,0.97,38810.138,38814.208,You're also adding a level of service expense to that model.,118,,
811,0.97,38814.208,38826.954,But what we're seeing is five times the rate of exits to permanent housing when we provide the right space and the right level of service to individuals who are experiencing homelessness.,118,,
812,0.97,38826.954,38838.566,"A lot of what you're saying is I think shown in the actions of this budget, in the 2020 budget, in the 2019 budget.",118,,
813,0.97,38838.566,38854.782,"There's been strong Alignmet between the human services Department and the Mayor on getting the shelter enhancements in place so that we can best support people in shelter, but more importantly, get folks exited to permanent housing ..",118,,
814,0.97,38854.782,38863.691,"And I want to make sure, though, that Councilmember Juarez's point is not missed.",119,,
815,0.97,38863.691,38869.897,We want to know how much money is here for strategic acquisition.,119,,
816,0.97,38869.897,38883.244,"I will highlight, though, that this is something at the county level through some of the committees that I serve on at the county level, this is a Win-Win for owners of hotels and apartment complexes where they are having trouble paying the mortgage.",119,,
817,0.97,38883.244,38890.484,And it's helpful for us as a region not to have derelict buildings and help House people.,119,,
818,0.97,38890.484,38893.087,We're familiar with the need for enhanced shelter.,119,,
819,0.97,38893.087,38895.089,"Deputy Mayor, you were about to say something.",119,,
820,0.97,38895.089,38898.426,I do want us to get to slides nine and ten.,119,,
821,0.97,38898.426,38906.701,And there's two more people to ask questions.,119,,
822,0.97,38906.701,38913.107,But the question is have we not learned the lesson that we need to have more individual rooms?,119,,
823,0.97,38913.107,38922.85,And are we putting money in for the long-term versus the short-term ten-month section for hotels?,119,,
824,0.97,38922.85,38932.193,And does this budget not invest in strategic acquisition of apartment complexes or hotels that might go Delict?,119,,
825,0.97,38932.193,38934.528,A few responses to that.,120,,
826,0.97,38934.528,38944.639,"One is that the short answer to your question is no, we are not proposing among this $42.1 million increase from the base to do any acquisition.",120,,
827,0.97,38944.639,38947.408,In part because of the restrictions on the fund source.,120,,
828,0.97,38947.408,38953.581,And also because we have no money to continue the operations.,120,,
829,0.97,38953.581,38960.521,"Of this $42.1 million, an important number for Council to zero in on, only $2.75 million is ongoing money.",120,,
830,0.97,38960.521,38969.397,"So, you know, that really forces us to make some decisions here.",120,,
831,0.97,38969.397,38985.479,"But again, I think the idea being here because this is money that is one-time that we have been given access to as part of the Covid-19 relief package and in terms of trying to keep people safe is putting that to use immediately.",120,,
832,0.97,38985.479,38986.681,And by utilizing this resource.,120,,
833,0.97,38986.681,39011.372,"I would say to you and to Councilmember Juarez that I want to remind everyone, since 2017, we have increased through conversion of basic and adding shelter, we have increased by 80% the number of enhanced shelter beds in the city in close partnership with Council.",120,,
834,0.97,39011.372,39015.91,And so I think that's an important thing.,120,,
835,0.97,39015.91,39025.152,The city invested millions of dollars in moving away from the mat on the floor and you don't have a place to come back to every night.,120,,
836,0.97,39025.152,39027.989,"Right now, it's from a Covid perspective.",120,,
837,0.97,39027.989,39044.105,"And a few weeks ago, we announced over $11 million on investments with shelter providers and operators making capital investments and other changes to the programs to make sure that the congregate spaces can remain safe in the Covid period.",120,,
838,0.97,39044.105,39049.11,"The last point is, you know, there's no additional funding source.",120,,
839,0.97,39049.11,39058.686,"And so moving to a Hoteling model, to Jason's point, frankly means without an identified new resource means we will serve less people.",120,,
840,0.97,39058.686,39069.764,"And so, you know, that is something we are happy to dig in more with you and others as you review the 2021 budget.",120,,
841,0.97,39069.764,39075.669,But I think that's a really important point.,120,,
842,0.97,39075.669,39081.208,I'll ask Councilmember Juarez for follow-up.,121,,
843,0.97,39081.208,39082.61,And I'm hoping to switch the order.,121,,
844,0.97,39082.61,39086.914,"And Councilmember Juarez, any follow-up?",121,,
845,0.97,39087.048,39088.349,"I'm good, thank you.",122,,
846,0.97,39088.482,39093.454,Thank you very much for the question.,123,,
847,0.97,39093.454,39096.357,I really appreciate you asking that.,123,,
848,0.97,39096.357,39096.857,And Councilmember Lewis?,123,,
849,0.97,39096.857,39101.929,It's related because I think it is related to the Sustainment of the Deintensity indication.,124,,
850,0.97,39101.929,39128.189,"And I wanted to ask a question about the relationship between the enhanced shelter expansions and the hotel units just because I know that through the efforts over the spring and summer, you know, a lot of shelter that is more congregate has been improved considerably.",124,,
851,0.97,39128.189,39134.328,But that has also resulted in some cases in reductions of total spaces.,124,,
852,0.97,39134.328,39155.683,And there was good reporting by Sydney Brownstone at the beginning of last month where she specifically sited from the reporting an example of a compass housing shelter creating new and improved spaces lost 13 placements.,124,,
853,0.97,39155.683,39181.809,"My concern is as we continue to sustain the Deintense efforts and the first sector of the slide here, you know, I don't want us to be sort of reducing units in sort of the one slide and then adding units in the other with less of a net increase.",124,,
854,0.97,39181.809,39212.773,I wonder if those concerns would be unfounded or if there is a concern whether we might have a lower net gain of units due to the nature of Transitioning from sort of a Prepandemic to a Postpandemic kind of system that will necessarily need to be Deintensified.,124,,
855,0.97,39212.773,39214.408,.,124,,
856,0.97,39214.408,39214.708,Thanks.,125,,
857,0.97,39214.708,39222.449,"And just Scrolling back up to my notes, I think I shared--Yeah.",125,,
858,0.97,39222.449,39222.75,Here we go.,125,,
859,0.97,39222.75,39230.457,So we are not looking at a reduction in the number of shelter beds.,125,,
860,0.97,39230.457,39231.258,We currently have 1479 shelter beds.,125,,
861,0.97,39231.258,39242.369,We Combpt to have just over 1700 beds by the end of 2020.,125,,
862,0.97,39242.369,39264.224,"And the 2021 budget builds on that 1700 by adding additional hotel units and really focusing on the throughput to housing for folks in these temporary spaces through the use of diversion, rapid Rehousing, and permanent supportive housing.",125,,
863,0.97,39264.224,39270.698,"At this point, you raise a concern that I share, that the team shares.",125,,
864,0.97,39270.698,39273.4,We did not want to reduce the number of beds.,125,,
865,0.97,39273.4,39286.347,I think the shelter funding that we have proposed in the 2021 budget builds on the activities in 2020 to sustain bed capacity and build on it.,125,,
866,0.97,39286.647,39289.083,.,125,,
867,0.97,39289.617,39289.783,Okay.,126,,
868,0.97,39289.783,39293.287,Thank you for that question.,126,,
869,0.97,39293.287,39294.722,I'm not seeing a follow-up.,126,,
870,0.97,39294.722,39295.589,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",126,,
871,0.97,39295.589,39297.091,Thank you so much.,127,,
872,0.97,39297.091,39300.594,I have a couple of questions here.,127,,
873,0.97,39300.594,39314.775,The first relates to the dollar amounts that we're committing to both the maintaining shelter and the rent assistance and extra prevention columns here.,127,,
874,0.97,39314.775,39338.766,"It would be really helpful, and maybe it's on a different slide, it would be helpful to compare this investment to the budgeted 2020 investment not including the Covid-19 relief investments we have made this year.",127,,
875,0.97,39338.766,39359.353,"And the reason I want to be able to see that we are not just budgeting to the original 2020 levels, but that we're budgeting to the 2020 levels plus the Covid-19 additions that we have made.",127,,
876,0.97,39359.353,39368.462,And the reason why that's so important is it's getting back to the jump start spending plan Úfor 2021.,127,,
877,0.97,39368.462,39387.014,"I want to see that the investments that we plan to add with jump start, add to the 2020 levels, I want to see that those additional investments in rent assistance and Eviction prevention and investing in shelter are included here.",127,,
878,0.97,39387.014,39403.964,So it would be great to get some sort of a breakout that makes those year to year comparisons plus includes the additions we made Numerou times throughout the year in 2020.,127,,
879,0.97,39403.964,39425.052,"And then also as it relates to the 125 units in enhanced shelter, it would be helpful to understand whether or not that is in multiple locations, whether or not we're thinking of a single location.",127,,
880,0.97,39425.052,39426.153,What's the plan behind that?,127,,
881,0.97,39426.153,39430.557,"And the timing, do we have any idea on the timing?",127,,
882,0.97,39430.557,39441.435,And then my last question relates to the rapid Rehousing and diversion funding being made available.,127,,
883,0.97,39441.435,39461.989,I appreciate director Johnson hearing that diversion funds will be made available and attached to outreach that the restoration of diversion funding that outreach providers have access to is a high priority of mine.,127,,
884,0.97,39461.989,39465.526,I appreciate that being included.,127,,
885,0.97,39465.526,39475.736,"Just wondering, when you say would be attached to outreach, does that mean it will be made available to contracted outreach providers to access?",127,,
886,0.97,39475.736,39480.107,And is that also the same for rapid Rehousing?,127,,
887,0.97,39480.107,39486.413,And how do you anticipate that this would work with coordinated entry?,127,,
888,0.97,39486.413,39508.402,And my last just thought going back to the Hoteling discussion is whether or not housing levy levy--consideration for a hotel purchase if there was such an opportunity.,127,,
889,0.97,39508.402,39514.408,"And maybe we'll hear from Emily, director Alvarado, about that later.",127,,
890,0.97,39514.408,39514.875,Thank you.,127,,
891,0.97,39514.875,39515.309,Great.,128,,
892,0.97,39515.309,39515.609,Thank you.,128,,
893,0.97,39515.609,39516.076,Very good questions.,128,,
894,0.97,39516.076,39522.916,"On rent assistance, we can provide that information.",128,,
895,0.97,39522.916,39523.283,We'll follow up.,128,,
896,0.97,39523.283,39528.856,"Unless Julie, you want to provide now?",128,,
897,0.97,39528.856,39534.728,Or do you think it's best to follow up?,128,,
898,0.97,39534.728,39534.862,.,128,,
899,0.97,39534.862,39535.095,Yeah.,129,,
900,0.97,39535.095,39535.295,Sure.,129,,
901,0.97,39535.295,39553.013,"I would just, that very first chart that we showed you with the stacked bars at the beginning, that really is the best visual demonstration of how we have found alternate funding sources in 2021.",129,,
902,0.97,39553.013,39564.925,And including the combination of funds between 2020 and 2021 to asking the Covid response from 2020 and into 2021.,129,,
903,0.97,39564.925,39570.864,We can provide you with more detail to show you the specifications.,129,,
904,0.97,39570.864,39572.633,That's the best visual representation.,129,,
905,0.97,39572.633,39573.0,Does that help?,129,,
906,0.97,39573.0,39577.738,I will go back and take a look at that page.,130,,
907,0.97,39577.738,39578.005,Great.,131,,
908,0.97,39578.005,39578.772,Thank you.,131,,
909,0.97,39578.772,39579.039,Great.,132,,
910,0.97,39579.039,39579.306,Thank you.,132,,
911,0.97,39579.306,39579.706,"Thank you, Julie.",132,,
912,0.97,39579.706,39590.984,"The 125-Unit shelter, we should be in a position shortly to provide more details about that single site.",132,,
913,0.97,39590.984,39596.39,And not in a position to share that now.,132,,
914,0.97,39596.39,39610.304,"But just know that at this point, the planning effort underway to stand up that enhanced shelter is at a single.",132,,
915,0.97,39610.304,39611.271,Rapid Rehousing and diversion.,132,,
916,0.97,39611.271,39615.842,"So the--yes, we need this tied to the right access point.",132,,
917,0.97,39615.842,39618.912,"And so for diversion, the right access point is outreach.",132,,
918,0.97,39618.912,39644.504,"And so we need to make the diversion fund available to the continuum of outreach providers and make sure that, you know, when they engage with an individual who has an alternative to living unsheltered, they can tap in to the fund source and work toward a solution for the individual.",132,,
919,0.97,39644.504,39653.981,"For rapid Rehousing, again, this is tied to the new enhanced shelter, as well as the hotel units that are being stood up on a temporary basis.",132,,
920,0.97,39653.981,39675.202,"We need to ensure that the rapid Rehousing dollars are, you know, immediately accessible to those shelter providers, the providers working in the hotels, so that they can work with those clients to get them into housing.",132,,
921,0.97,39675.202,39682.442,And then coordinated entry offers a good connection point to permanent supportive housing.,132,,
922,0.97,39682.442,39701.661,"So I think, you know, what still needs to be worked out is how we can leverage that system to make a direct connection for the individuals in the shelters, in the hotels, to those permanent supportive housing units.",132,,
923,0.97,39701.661,39703.03,"Last question, yes.",132,,
924,0.97,39703.03,39706.767,Let's talk to Emily about levy and acquisition funds.,132,,
925,0.97,39706.9,39707.3,Thank you.,133,,
926,0.97,39707.3,39714.741,"I noted that as well for the housing presentation, which we will start for the folks at O.H.",133,,
927,0.97,39714.741,39722.416,At 12:00 noon so you have the last hour.,133,,
928,0.97,39722.416,39722.816,Thank you.,133,,
929,0.97,39722.816,39723.55,Councilmember Morales?,133,,
930,0.97,39723.55,39724.885,Thank you.,134,,
931,0.97,39724.885,39726.186,I have one question.,134,,
932,0.97,39726.186,39727.621,"Well, really two.",134,,
933,0.97,39727.621,39733.527,But I first want to thank Councilmember Juarez for her questions.,134,,
934,0.97,39733.527,39738.832,I think all of us have been hearing plenty from our constituents.,134,,
935,0.97,39738.832,39745.472,"And we know that when it comes to homelessness, people are angry in the city.",134,,
936,0.97,39745.472,39767.728,"And whether they're angry because there are needles in the park, or they're angry because their neighbors are in the fifth year of a declared crisis, there's a lot of frustration in our community about what seems like, you know, we are chasing our tails, spinning our wheels, whatever metaphor you want to use.",134,,
937,0.97,39767.728,39783.61,"If we don't have a plan for the budget, to think about strategic acquisition, I suggest we get one and start thinking about how to move in that direction.",134,,
938,0.97,39783.61,39791.818,The pandemic is not going away any time soon and the homelessness needs a new strategy to support people moving out of homelessness.,134,,
939,0.97,39791.818,39795.989,"That said, it is exciting to see 300 hotel spaces.",134,,
940,0.97,39795.989,39803.43,"I think to thank you, director Johnson, deputy Mayor, for moving in this direction.",134,,
941,0.97,39803.43,39807.701,This is something our officer and other offices have been advocating for.,134,,
942,0.97,39807.701,39816.877,My question about that is whether this is a continuation of service through Colead or if this will be administered through another program?,134,,
943,0.97,39816.877,39825.418,"And I want to say that regardless of the answer, this is an area where the Council and the executives share common ground.",134,,
944,0.97,39825.418,39843.203,So our office would be interested in working with the executive to see a continuation or expansion of Colead or just care and any of the other hotel programs that are operating right now.,134,,
945,0.97,39843.336,39844.404,Great.,135,,
946,0.97,39844.404,39844.671,Thank you.,135,,
947,0.97,39844.671,39849.709,Let's see.,135,,
948,0.97,39849.709,39850.076,Where to start?,135,,
949,0.97,39850.076,39872.732,"One, I think it's important to understand that, you know, while we're excited to use available hotel space to temporarily offer individuals who are currently living unsheltered, this is also not our first Forray into Hoteling.",135,,
950,0.97,39872.732,39886.079,The city of Seattle through Hsd's contracts have been Partnering with King County Department of community and human services to get hundreds of individuals into hotels during this pandemic.,135,,
951,0.97,39886.079,39908.468,"We have shown great flexibility in our service contracts so that individuals continue to be served and operations continue to be paid for through city contracts when people have been relocated to hotels, sometimes even hotels outside of the city of Seattle to be supported during the Covid pandemic.",135,,
952,0.97,39908.468,39930.891,"What we're committed to here is adding to the good work and making a investment to continue that important strategy of getting individuals, especially those high risk vulnerable individuals into single rooms so that they can safely shelter while we find housing for them.",135,,
953,0.97,39930.891,39940.934,I think your--you had a second question.,135,,
954,0.97,39940.934,39941.534,Could you ask it again?,135,,
955,0.97,39941.534,39945.972,"Well, I was asking about the Colead or other--.",136,,
956,0.97,39945.972,39946.539,Thank you.,137,,
957,0.97,39946.539,39947.474,That was it.,137,,
958,0.97,39947.474,39947.774,Yeah.,137,,
959,0.97,39947.774,39973.033,"So we are going to be releasing a quite expedited Rfp to ask who in the homeless service provider network would be available and able to be the service provider for the new enhanced shelter, as well as the service provider in the hotels.",137,,
960,0.97,39973.033,39979.072,So a specific provider at this point has not been identified.,137,,
961,0.97,39979.072,39980.607,That process will begin shortly.,137,,
962,0.97,39980.607,39982.275,And we'll identify the partners through the process.,137,,
963,0.97,39982.409,39982.609,Okay.,138,,
964,0.97,39982.609,39991.418,And then my second question is about the enhanced 125 shelter spaces.,138,,
965,0.97,39991.418,40010.87,"It sounds like this might be similar to the current navigation center, which I will say, you know, our Unhoused neighbors expressed an appreciation for that model and would like to talk about that as a referral option for folks.",138,,
966,0.97,40010.87,40040.734,"So my one caution with that is that if that is the plan to do another navigation Center-Type facility that we be really clear with the communities that we are considering so that we don't duplicate the crisis that we had when the navigation center, when the decision was made to put it in the Cid, to put it in the little Saigon area without contacting the community first.",138,,
967,0.97,40040.734,40046.473,"As you know, it was a huge problem for community not to be included in the conversation.",138,,
968,0.97,40046.473,40047.807,So I appreciate the model.,138,,
969,0.97,40047.807,40049.509,I think it's an important one.,138,,
970,0.97,40049.509,40059.519,But I would recommend for the sake of transparency and building relationship with our community members that we make sure folks are included at the beginning in the conversations.,138,,
971,0.97,40059.652,40060.42,Of course.,139,,
972,0.97,40060.42,40068.495,"And first, I agree with you.",139,,
973,0.97,40068.495,40071.931,I think the navigation have is a strong model.,139,,
974,0.97,40071.931,40082.876,"And I think anything we can do to remove barriers to people coming indoors and having a roof overhead and access to the services they need, we should always, you know, thrive to do that.",139,,
975,0.97,40082.876,40094.02,But this 125 shelter program is going to be an enhanced shelter.,139,,
976,0.97,40094.02,40096.423,So 24/7 nature.,139,,
977,0.97,40096.423,40097.991,"There will be services provided, storage.",139,,
978,0.97,40097.991,40102.829,But it is not going to be a navigation center.,139,,
979,0.97,40102.829,40114.541,"So just to--you know, we could go into sort of the details of what is different about a navigation center model.",139,,
980,0.97,40114.541,40123.216,But this will be an enhanced shelter like so many of the hundreds of enhanced shelter beds across the city.,139,,
981,0.97,40123.216,40126.82,But will not be a second navigation center.,139,,
982,0.97,40126.953,40129.589,"Thank you, director Johnson.",140,,
983,0.97,40129.589,40134.227,"To close us out on the slide, Councilmember Sawant.",140,,
984,0.97,40134.227,40143.503,"And I'll ask us to get to slide nine, which is prompting a number of questions.",140,,
985,0.97,40143.503,40147.974,Councilmember Lewis and Morales Teed up.,140,,
986,0.97,40147.974,40148.608,"Councilmember Sawant, go ahead.",140,,
987,0.97,40148.608,40154.38,So I was going to save the question until the end of the presentation because I thought it may be a long day.,141,,
988,0.97,40154.38,40162.422,"Given the discussion the way it's shaped, it makes sense to ask it here.",141,,
989,0.97,40162.422,40170.563,"Obviously, my office very strongly supports acquiring hotel space for shelter, especially during the pandemic.",141,,
990,0.97,40170.563,40175.535,I agree with many of the points made by other Council members.,141,,
991,0.97,40175.535,40178.838,My questions were related to tiny houses.,141,,
992,0.97,40178.838,40183.209,I don't believe you have mentioned that at all in the presentation.,141,,
993,0.97,40183.209,40184.41,It's possible I missed it.,141,,
994,0.97,40184.41,40189.582,"Unfortunately, I had personal things to attend to and I missed a few minutes here and there.",141,,
995,0.97,40189.582,40192.685,Maybe you mentioned it and I didn't catch it.,141,,
996,0.97,40192.685,40203.563,But my questions are what plans do you have to expand tiny House villages?,141,,
997,0.97,40203.563,40219.479,"Of all of the different ways the city--all of the different approaches the city can use to reduce the harm of homelessness, tiny House villages have been by far, just by far, the most successful.",141,,
998,0.97,40219.479,40228.254,"Obviously, we're talking about the measure we can use while our neighbors are homeless, not as a competition for permanent housing.",141,,
999,0.97,40228.254,40231.658,"Of course, we want affordable housing and to expand social housing.",141,,
1000,0.97,40231.658,40236.296,But we're talking about why people are homeless.,141,,
1001,0.97,40236.296,40246.239,"In that situation, tiny House villages have been the most successful at helping people transition to permanent housing.",141,,
1002,0.97,40246.239,40256.683,They are the most successful of people gaining control over their lives and letting people live in dignity.,141,,
1003,0.97,40256.683,40261.854,And they can isolate to avoid the spread of Covid-19.,141,,
1004,0.97,40261.854,40262.522,It's effective in that respect.,141,,
1005,0.97,40262.522,40270.863,People have the privacy and safety and peace of mind of their own space and community.,141,,
1006,0.97,40270.863,40278.004,"In some villages, a Self-Managed community to cut across the isolation of living on the streets.",141,,
1007,0.97,40278.004,40291.084,"And they are so successful and humane and we have had hundreds of homeless people, easily hundreds over the years come testify in public comment in support of tiny House villages to talk about how helpful they are.",141,,
1008,0.97,40291.084,40299.826,I have never seen anything like that on any other homeless service investment.,141,,
1009,0.97,40299.826,40303.296,"We hear Data-Driven, Evidence-Based all the time.",141,,
1010,0.97,40303.296,40305.698,Here's the data and here's the evidence.,141,,
1011,0.97,40305.698,40314.974,Hundreds of homeless people have said to us and told us how supportive tiny House villages were and how helpful they were.,141,,
1012,0.97,40314.974,40323.149,We have never seen anything like that from any other homelessness services investment.,141,,
1013,0.97,40323.149,40324.15,To my knowledge.,141,,
1014,0.97,40324.15,40324.55,Maybe there are.,141,,
1015,0.97,40324.55,40331.858,"But to my knowledge, there has never been a homeless person who has come and testified in support of enhanced shelters.",141,,
1016,0.97,40331.858,40336.729,That doesn't really stick in my memory.,141,,
1017,0.97,40336.729,40338.031,Shelter space is important.,141,,
1018,0.97,40338.031,40348.274,Any kind of shelter space to make available to keep our neighbors safe in terms of health and other dangers.,141,,
1019,0.97,40348.274,40354.18,We need to do everything in our power.,141,,
1020,0.97,40354.18,40368.161,"And the advocacy for the tiny House villages, all of this illustrates how exceptional tiny House villages are.",141,,
1021,0.97,40368.161,40382.442,They have five locations identified and ready to go to build the new tiny House villages which would help hundreds of people get out of the streets.,141,,
1022,0.97,40382.442,40388.214,And we have one fund for tiny House villages through the Amazon tax.,141,,
1023,0.97,40388.214,40393.586,And I know you were seeking FEMA reimbursement.,141,,
1024,0.97,40393.586,40405.898,"So my question is isn't the Mayor's office under your leadership, director Johnson, why have you not expanded the tiny House villages yet?",141,,
1025,0.97,40405.898,40409.502,And will you do so before the end of this year?,141,,
1026,0.97,40409.502,40415.208,Is it included in the funding for Noncongregate shelter for next year?,141,,
1027,0.97,40415.208,40422.849,And what will be INS to make the Mayor finally agree to substantially expand tiny House villages?,141,,
1028,0.97,40422.849,40426.519,If you could be open about that.,141,,
1029,0.97,40426.652,40429.822,Thank you.,142,,
1030,0.97,40429.822,40430.056,Yeah.,143,,
1031,0.97,40430.056,40432.692,I will be very open and very Frank about it.,143,,
1032,0.97,40432.692,40452.311,"Under my leadership at the human services Department, we have gone from, you know, some tiny House villages or camp--tent Encampments so now supporting eight tiny House villages.",143,,
1033,0.97,40452.311,40456.349,Those tiny House villages are one example of enhanced shelter.,143,,
1034,0.97,40456.349,40469.529,"When advocates are going and saying that they appreciate and have been supported through tiny House villages, what they are saying is enhanced shelter is working.",143,,
1035,0.97,40469.529,40475.668,And tiny House villages are one example of those enhancements.,143,,
1036,0.97,40475.668,40480.807,"So we have, you know, over 300 units of at any house village enhanced shelter.",143,,
1037,0.97,40480.807,40498.891,"And I have been extremely proud to partner with a number of neighborhoods, business organizations, importantly to call out Lehi and the important work that they have been doing to stand those shelter resources up.",143,,
1038,0.97,40498.891,40510.636,This budget in 2021 sustains the current investments in tiny House villages.,143,,
1039,0.97,40510.636,40526.686,So the $120 million line item under the King County regional homeless authority maintains the current level of programming at these tiny House village programs that we have operating now.,143,,
1040,0.97,40526.686,40533.993,"Just this year in 2020, we were able to stand up two additional sites.",143,,
1041,0.97,40533.993,40544.504,And so the work of standing up tiny home villages and adding to that program continues.,143,,
1042,0.97,40544.504,40546.405,And this budget sustains that effort.,143,,
1043,0.97,40546.405,40556.649,"This budget, however, does not offer any new funding for tiny home villages to be stood up if 2021.",143,,
1044,0.97,40556.649,40564.724,"Instead, we are creating, again, very similar model, individual unit, Enhancement of services, 24/7 support through the use of hotel rooms.",143,,
1045,0.97,40564.724,40587.647,"And given that we have a limited one-time funding source, we felt like the use of temporary use of hotels was a smart way to achieve some of the great results that we have seen in other enhanced shelter models, including tiny House villages.",143,,
1046,0.97,40587.647,40590.883,"Councilmember, I want to move this along.",144,,
1047,0.97,40590.883,40592.785,I will NOTE your interest in this.,144,,
1048,0.97,40592.785,40601.36,I'm assuming you would like to add more funding in 2021.,144,,
1049,0.97,40601.36,40601.594,Yeah.,145,,
1050,0.97,40601.594,40602.862,I haven't spoken much.,145,,
1051,0.97,40602.862,40603.729,I appreciate it.,146,,
1052,0.97,40603.729,40604.764,We have a navigation slide next.,146,,
1053,0.97,40604.764,40607.567,I know there's going to be a lot of comments on that.,146,,
1054,0.97,40607.567,40610.202,.,146,,
1055,0.97,40610.202,40610.67,I understand that.,147,,
1056,0.97,40610.67,40614.34,But I'm only speaking when I think it's absolutely crucial.,147,,
1057,0.97,40614.34,40618.411,I think this is a very crucial point.,147,,
1058,0.97,40618.411,40626.619,And I don't think director Johnson actually answered my question.,147,,
1059,0.97,40626.619,40627.586,The question was about expanding.,147,,
1060,0.97,40627.586,40632.959,And that still remains to be resolved.,147,,
1061,0.97,40632.959,40643.469,"And yes, I absolutely think in my view, the city council's work in the budget, it is important to expand.",147,,
1062,0.97,40643.469,40647.073,And I would really feel for support from all Councilmembers to do that.,147,,
1063,0.97,40647.073,40656.649,"But on the numbers that interim director Johnson used, you said eight villages.",147,,
1064,0.97,40656.649,40662.688,In my understanding there were nine or ten villages last year.,147,,
1065,0.97,40662.688,40664.423,Is eight a reduction?,147,,
1066,0.97,40664.423,40671.564,And where does the Mayor stand on the North Lake tiny House villages?,147,,
1067,0.97,40671.564,40682.008,"They're still going to be an attempt to close that down, which of course was pushed back successfully by the activists in the community earlier this year.",147,,
1068,0.97,40682.008,40684.577,So if you could just answer that quickly.,147,,
1069,0.97,40684.877,40687.313,.,147,,
1070,0.97,40694.22,40694.387,Yeah.,148,,
1071,0.97,40694.387,40701.427,There has not been a reduction in the number of tiny House village programs.,148,,
1072,0.97,40701.427,40707.733,"Again, the 2021 budget sustains all current programming that is underway in 2020.",148,,
1073,0.97,40707.733,40726.585,"The North Lake right now, the human services Department does not have any kind of formal relationship to the North Lake village.",148,,
1074,0.97,40726.585,40730.923,"You know, it sounds like things remain as they have been throughout this entire year.",148,,
1075,0.97,40730.923,40743.235,"But at this point, you know, there's not a budget line item for that program, nor is there a formal relationship between that program and the human services Department.",148,,
1076,0.97,40743.536,40745.137,.,148,,
1077,0.97,40753.479,40753.913,Councilmember Sawant?,149,,
1078,0.97,40753.913,40754.313,Does that answer?,149,,
1079,0.97,40754.313,40760.352,"I mean, it's not surprising to me what director Johnson is saying.",150,,
1080,0.97,40760.352,40762.922,But I'm okay stopping here and then following up later.,150,,
1081,0.97,40762.922,40767.927,I really do appreciate your line of questioning on this.,151,,
1082,0.97,40767.927,40768.527,Thank you very much.,151,,
1083,0.97,40768.527,40772.898,And we'll look forward to following up with you on the item.,151,,
1084,0.97,40772.898,40773.099,Okay.,151,,
1085,0.97,40773.099,40777.203,I think that concludes the questions for this slide.,151,,
1086,0.97,40777.203,40779.004,"Let's move on to slide nine, please.",151,,
1087,0.97,40779.138,40783.309,Great.,152,,
1088,0.97,40783.309,40784.21,Thank you.,152,,
1089,0.97,40784.21,40790.316,So this is the 2021 outreach strategy.,152,,
1090,0.97,40790.316,40798.257,So the 2021 proposed budget by the Mayor invests $10.7 million in outreach for people experiencing homelessness.,152,,
1091,0.97,40798.257,40810.503,"The city will play a central role in coordinating the agencies that work directly with people living unsheltered, and provide direct outreach to people living unsheltered on public properties and in public right of ways.",152,,
1092,0.97,40810.503,40828.754,"Historically, when Hsd refers to the NAV team, we are talking about the entire Teem, the system navigator, field Coordinators, communication and data experts, and the specially trained police officers on the team.",152,,
1093,0.97,40828.754,40842.001,We realize that many don't hear it that way when their work has become synonymous with the participation of police officers.,152,,
1094,0.97,40842.001,40847.973,This new outreach and response model is very much human service centered.,152,,
1095,0.97,40847.973,40856.382,This team will be responsible for coordinating across agencies and city departments.,152,,
1096,0.97,40856.382,40858.584,This will be an Hsd-Centered team.,152,,
1097,0.97,40858.584,40859.418,Coordinated and led by the Department.,152,,
1098,0.97,40859.418,40870.93,"Under this model, Hsd will coordinate efforts across city departments and facilitate the Community-Based contract outreach effort.",152,,
1099,0.97,40870.93,40874.466,This includes coordination with SPD.,152,,
1100,0.97,40874.466,40886.312,And we will consider SPD's participation and continued partnership ultimately command decisions are made by chief Diaz case by case.,152,,
1101,0.97,40886.312,40898.924,But this model Leverages the expertise of the human services Department team members and agencies in the community that have been serving people experiencing homelessness to help connect people to the services they need and ultimately to housing.,152,,
1102,0.97,40898.924,40911.537,"In the 2021 budget, the new outreach and response team is an Eight-Person team.",152,,
1103,0.97,40911.537,40916.642,This team in the human services Department would have a team lead or a team manager.,152,,
1104,0.97,40916.642,40920.679,They would have an outreach manager or coordinator.,152,,
1105,0.97,40920.679,40926.852,"They would continue to have two system navigators in the fields to make connections, important connections to services.",152,,
1106,0.97,40926.852,40935.361,They would have a field coordinator or site assessor.,152,,
1107,0.97,40935.361,40942.868,The city Department coordinator would continue to have a data analyst and a communications staff.,152,,
1108,0.97,40942.868,40952.611,This is a budget reduction of five Tfe from the navigation team.,152,,
1109,0.97,40952.611,40963.188,"And this also transfers those--four of those positions and 976,000 of budget from the navigation team to the safe and thriving communities division.",152,,
1110,0.97,40963.188,40971.397,We are Repurposing these four pockets from the NAV team to the safety division.,152,,
1111,0.97,40971.397,40973.065,We talked about this extensively yesterday.,152,,
1112,0.97,40973.065,40980.439,"And, you know, happy to answer any questions about that transition as we move forward.",152,,
1113,0.97,40980.439,41002.861,"But in the 2021 budget, the NAV team or this new outreach team going from 16Fte throughout the Department to 8 will require one abrogated position and four positions that would be Repurposed.",152,,
1114,0.97,41002.861,41015.641,The city must play a central role in coordinating the outreach services and responding to the impact of unmanaged Encampments on public property.,152,,
1115,0.97,41015.641,41021.647,We hold a contractual relationship with all agencies that provide outreach to people experiencing homelessness.,152,,
1116,0.97,41021.647,41030.189,We are a steward of the public dollars that support both the agencies and shelter resources.,152,,
1117,0.97,41030.189,41035.194,We are able to support a centralized referral process to the new shelters and hotel resources.,152,,
1118,0.97,41035.194,41046.071,Other Continuums of care have centralized processes for insuring that people can access emergency shelter.,152,,
1119,0.97,41046.071,41047.673,Seattle and King County do not.,152,,
1120,0.97,41047.673,41062.354,This team will help the city remain in compliance with the Mdar and play a critical role in ensuring that all available shelter and hotel resources are full.,152,,
1121,0.97,41062.354,41073.232,"The new division dollars are connected to this effort, helping people bypass other shelter systems and find housing stability.",152,,
1122,0.97,41073.232,41088.113,"So as we discussed, diversion will be a critical part that this Hsd outreach team and the contracted outreach teams can use to make those connections to stable housing.",152,,
1123,0.97,41088.113,41094.586,This effort requires collaboration between the city and City-Funded agencies.,152,,
1124,0.97,41094.586,41110.969,So Hsd staff will work with the homeless outreach contracted agencies on a weekly basis and are in a really good position to continue to build these relationships and coordinate where outreach takes place.,152,,
1125,0.97,41110.969,41118.544,The unsheltered response team total budget is $1.3 million.,152,,
1126,0.97,41118.544,41130.422,"Also in this budget program area is the lead contract from the PSA, which is $6.2 million.",152,,
1127,0.97,41130.422,41146.171,And then the other outreach contracts totalling $3.2 million will be in the King County regional homeless authority budget area.,152,,
1128,0.97,41146.171,41153.112,"The outreach continuum will, you know, be enhanced by the partnership.",152,,
1129,0.97,41153.112,41160.652,This is intended to be a Laser-Focused outreach effort in partnership with Community-Based organizations.,152,,
1130,0.97,41160.652,41166.859,But a team internally at the human services Department that would coordinate and facilitate all of those.,152,,
1131,0.97,41167.159,41168.694,.,152,,
1132,0.97,41169.027,41174.333,"Director Johnson, thank you for walking us through this.",153,,
1133,0.97,41174.333,41176.869,The first person up is Councilmember Lewis.,153,,
1134,0.97,41176.869,41177.436,Thank you.,154,,
1135,0.97,41177.436,41180.772,I have a couple of questions here to clarify first.,154,,
1136,0.97,41180.772,41185.878,And then I have a few more policy questions.,154,,
1137,0.97,41185.878,41197.156,"First, director Johnson, you stated that of that $9.4 million category there, $6.2 million is the current lead contract.",154,,
1138,0.97,41197.156,41198.79,That's correct.,155,,
1139,0.97,41198.79,41199.024,Okay.,156,,
1140,0.97,41199.024,41205.197,So are there any other contracts there that are existing and would carry over?,156,,
1141,0.97,41205.197,41210.702,Or do you envision $3.2 million in New contracting services?,156,,
1142,0.97,41210.836,41223.282,So the contracts and the contracted providers that we have a relationship with are all listed on the slide.,157,,
1143,0.97,41223.282,41228.42,Lead or the PDA has $6.2 million awarded in their contracts.,157,,
1144,0.97,41228.42,41233.425,And the nearly $3.5 million is spread across all of these other organizations.,157,,
1145,0.97,41233.425,41234.726,And that would remain--.,157,,
1146,0.97,41234.726,41237.296,"But, sorry, would that be new?",158,,
1147,0.97,41237.296,41245.771,Or is that carrying over current money that we spend on contracting for those services?,158,,
1148,0.97,41245.771,41252.411,It's a little bit of both.,159,,
1149,0.97,41252.411,41252.811,Mostly carryover.,159,,
1150,0.97,41252.811,41253.245,Mostly maintaining.,159,,
1151,0.97,41253.245,41253.512,Great.,160,,
1152,0.97,41253.512,41256.915,I wanted to clarify that.,160,,
1153,0.97,41256.915,41279.071,"And looking on the other side, and you know, I don't know that we touched on this a lot yesterday in the conversation, but clearly from looking at this, it doesn't look like there's any police Department Ftes that are part of this team.",160,,
1154,0.97,41279.071,41284.076,What would be the relationship between this team and SPD?,160,,
1155,0.97,41284.076,41299.658,I would imagine that would be a community concern that we are going to hear through the the budget process is how that relationship is going to be Operationalized under this new structure.,160,,
1156,0.97,41299.658,41302.995,It seems there will be separate but coordinating teams.,160,,
1157,0.97,41302.995,41315.407,"I want to know, you know, if this team flags that they might need police assistance for something, how do you envision that process working operationally?",160,,
1158,0.97,41315.407,41315.641,Yeah.,161,,
1159,0.97,41315.641,41327.386,And I think deputy Mayor Sixkiller is probably in the best position to discuss current conversations with chief Diaz.,161,,
1160,0.97,41327.386,41336.728,"Casey, do you want to start off here, and then I can answer any other questions?",161,,
1161,0.97,41336.728,41337.663,"Councilmember, you're direct.",162,,
1162,0.97,41337.663,41341.6,This Hsd-Centered team does not include members of SPD.,162,,
1163,0.97,41341.6,41351.643,"You know, in term of the future role between this team and SPD, that's an ongoing conversation with chief Diaz.",162,,
1164,0.97,41351.643,41370.028,"I would point out, though, that we continue to believe and as I have articulated this week, having officers who are trained and available to support as necessary when the need arises I think is very important.",162,,
1165,0.97,41370.028,41376.668,How and when that occurs is something that is an ongoing discussion with SPD right now.,162,,
1166,0.97,41376.668,41383.809,And you are correct in your assessment here that they are not part of this Hsd-Centered team.,162,,
1167,0.97,41383.809,41383.975,.,162,,
1168,0.97,41383.975,41384.242,Right.,163,,
1169,0.97,41384.242,41393.452,I guess part of my concern is that seems to be a relevant policy consideration to adopting this new outreach strategy.,163,,
1170,0.97,41393.452,41404.896,It seems like addressing these in silos won't answer a lot of the community concerns that we have been hearing about the role the police play in the outreach strategy.,163,,
1171,0.97,41404.896,41425.784,"So I guess that as we go through the budget process, I would encourage all of us to join those two conversations instead of trying to have them separately and having situations next year where the overlap between those creates new problems and controversies in the city's outreach strategy.",163,,
1172,0.97,41425.784,41428.92,So that would just be the first thing I would want to address.,163,,
1173,0.97,41428.92,41460.585,I think the other thing that I want to raise in looking at sort of the universe of community service providers is the extent to which there has been collaboration and consultation in the development of this new outreach strategy.,163,,
1174,0.97,41460.585,41464.689,Has this proposal been disgust discussed.,163,,
1175,0.97,41464.689,41469.227,Are this in a position to provide the level of service necessary for this?,163,,
1176,0.97,41469.227,41475.033,Just curious in developing this how much work has been done with the provider community to this point.,163,,
1177,0.97,41475.033,41478.737,.,163,,
1178,0.97,41478.737,41484.843,I would say a reminder they are contractors to the city.,164,,
1179,0.97,41484.843,41492.05,"So I would say, you know, we have had some informal conversation with some of the organizations.",164,,
1180,0.97,41492.05,41506.898,"I think what you're seeing before you, Councilmember, is our good fact effort to continue to refine the way we are conducting outreach and coordination of the city's resources.",164,,
1181,0.97,41506.898,41532.858,"I think by shrinking what used to be a 16-Person team to 8 and focusing in requires us to have more direct conversation to both understand what their capabilities are, concerns are, their ideas of how to potentially continue to improve and refine what we're doing here.",164,,
1182,0.97,41532.858,41536.428,But this is a change from the status quo.,164,,
1183,0.97,41536.428,41549.875,"And I realize that some of the titles may look very similar, but I think it necessarily requires us to do even more coordinated with our contracted outreach providers.",164,,
1184,0.97,41549.875,41550.842,Right.,165,,
1185,0.97,41550.842,41563.154,And I recognize that this does represent a change in approach and that these are organizations that we have had contracts with in the past.,165,,
1186,0.97,41563.154,41576.501,"I guess, you know, just even though we have had contracts with them, they have not been reluctant to publicly criticize some of the concerns they have had with the status quo outreach approach.",165,,
1187,0.97,41576.501,41587.646,"And so I guess I'm wondering if these changes to the status quo are responsive to some of this concerns, or if that's an ongoing conversation?",165,,
1188,0.97,41587.646,41597.289,And that's sort of related to my comments about the Divorcing of the conversation between the potential policing component and the outreach strategy.,165,,
1189,0.97,41597.289,41609.267,"Because I think that unless those conversations are combined, I just wonder if some of those concerns are still going to exist as we have this discussion in the fall.",165,,
1190,0.97,41609.267,41620.478,So I just wanted--I'm just asking about the extent of the conversation so far just to know the foundation.,165,,
1191,0.97,41620.478,41639.364,"I guess the simple response is certainly since the beginning of February, the primary focus of the navigation team was outreach and coordination with the contract providers both to people in the shelter action which they did very, very well when new units became available in March and April.",166,,
1192,0.97,41639.364,41646.838,"And I think importantly, to provide outreach and engagement around Covid-19 safety, safety kits, and a bunch of other things.",166,,
1193,0.97,41646.838,41656.514,"So I would say that we are anticipating as we have discussed throughout the morning here, that we will be in a continued state of global pandemic response here at the city.",166,,
1194,0.97,41656.514,41676.267,"And this is exactly what we are anticipating this team to be focused on is how we are getting people inside, how we are--you know, if we're bringing on 425 new units of housing, we need a coordinated fashion with the city and the contractor providers.",166,,
1195,0.97,41676.267,41691.016,"Yeah, this is a really unique moment for the city and opportunity for us to do some, you know, very intentional outreach for individuals experiencing homelessness on the streets in Seattle.",166,,
1196,0.97,41691.149,41693.852,"Deputy Mayor, I'm sorry to interrupt.",167,,
1197,0.97,41693.852,41698.39,"I want to note, though, you mentioned the effectiveness of the team.",167,,
1198,0.97,41698.39,41702.127,And that's just not borne out by the data that we have received.,167,,
1199,0.97,41702.127,41706.331,And not all of the data we have asked for has been presented.,167,,
1200,0.97,41706.331,41714.072,There's a number of Councilmembers on this meeting right now who have repeatedly asked for that type of data.,167,,
1201,0.97,41714.072,41722.714,"When we made decisions about how to best do the outreach and engagement, it is because of the data we looked at.",167,,
1202,0.97,41722.714,41723.682,Please continue.,167,,
1203,0.97,41723.682,41727.085,"No, that's quite all right.",168,,
1204,0.97,41727.085,41731.056,I do just have just a little bit more here.,168,,
1205,0.97,41731.056,41739.13,"And then I'll turn it over to the other member of the committee, who I'm sure will have similar questions.",168,,
1206,0.97,41739.13,41748.406,"In looking at this second box of the outreach, the city did--and I think this is related.",168,,
1207,0.97,41748.406,41756.481,This will presumably if approved by the Council go into effect in January of 2021.,168,,
1208,0.97,41756.481,41792.016,"I guess I would ask in terms of our bridge period throughout the rest of 2020, the Council appropriated, I checked with Allie on the central staff earlier this week to see, $2.9 million, including $1.4 million of new investment to maintain and expand homelessness outreach and engagement services, including flexible assistance, case management, housing navigation Servicings, similar things to the services indicated in the slide.",168,,
1209,0.97,41792.016,41804.796,I wonder what the plan is to take advantage of those resources for homelessness Outreac for the rest of 2020 by contracting with these providers.,168,,
1210,0.97,41804.796,41820.145,"And since I have the principles here, director Johnson and deputy Mayor Sixkiller, how do you see those investments dove tailing with the new outreach strategy in 2021.",168,,
1211,0.97,41820.145,41825.583,"Well, the simple answer is we're trying to figure that out.",169,,
1212,0.97,41825.583,41828.153,The $2.9 number is from several months ago.,169,,
1213,0.97,41828.153,41829.454,"Today, it's less.",169,,
1214,0.97,41829.454,41832.29,That is entirely coming from the salaries of employees.,169,,
1215,0.97,41832.29,41834.959,They are still on the city's payroll.,169,,
1216,0.97,41834.959,41842.834,So we are in the process of working through the process with the impacted employees.,169,,
1217,0.97,41842.834,41858.983,And then we'll be determining what we can do in terms of as Council has put it savings that would come from the loss of those positions for the remainder of the year.,169,,
1218,0.97,41859.117,41860.752,I would offer a little bit more detail.,170,,
1219,0.97,41860.752,41872.03,"You know, council's recent actions formally take place 30 days after the vote, so October 22nd.",170,,
1220,0.97,41872.03,41878.77,Irng there is a lot for the current NAV team to be considering as this program ramps down and changes.,170,,
1221,0.97,41878.77,41891.883,"So issues like determining what to do with the warehouse of personal belongings, how to manage shelter referrals, coordination of encampment outreach.",170,,
1222,0.97,41891.883,41897.956,This team specifically has been steeped in and relied on for their Covid-19 response.,170,,
1223,0.97,41897.956,41905.73,There is--they are lead for coordination of other departments.,170,,
1224,0.97,41905.73,41910.969,"Public land management, specifically helping Spu, parks, FAS and others.",170,,
1225,0.97,41910.969,41922.847,They are the ones who get people inside.,170,,
1226,0.97,41922.847,41931.155,They are the ones instrumental in standing up resource fairs and resource connections for folks during those climate crisis.,170,,
1227,0.97,41931.155,41943.134,Working through the issues and figuring out how to transfer this effort or identifying what risks exist if we cannot will take time.,170,,
1228,0.97,41943.268,41963.121,There are nine city employees who would face layoff.,171,,
1229,0.97,41963.121,41975.633,And I owe it to them to provide at least very minimum 30 days' notice once this Council's action takes place.,171,,
1230,0.97,41975.633,41978.803,Tha puts into November.,171,,
1231,0.97,41978.803,41990.682,"And, you know, as deputy Mayor Sixkiller has already flagged, I think that the number that you just used was from some time ago.",171,,
1232,0.97,41990.682,42010.902,And there is work to do to figure out how much is actually available in 2020 to add to Community-Based outreach of contracts.,171,,
1233,0.97,42010.902,42022.68,"Like wise, I want to highlight that Hsd will need to determine a equitable distribution of funding for outreach providers.",171,,
1234,0.97,42022.68,42026.084,"Current, our largest contract holders with White-Led.",171,,
1235,0.97,42026.084,42035.259,And we would be interested in developing strategies to get additional funding for outreach programs such as urban and Indian led.,171,,
1236,0.97,42035.259,42038.997,And that's a body of work ahead of us.,171,,
1237,0.97,42038.997,42045.37,I note that we have the lead budget person from central staff.,172,,
1238,0.97,42045.37,42051.209,If I might ask if Allie has clarifying pieces to add for us.,172,,
1239,0.97,42051.209,42052.276,Thank you.,173,,
1240,0.97,42052.276,42054.679,Good afternoon--or good morning.,173,,
1241,0.97,42054.679,42060.485,I just wanted to clarify a couple of things.,173,,
1242,0.97,42060.485,42070.428,Of the $2.9 million subject about just under $1.5 million based on staffing cost.,173,,
1243,0.97,42070.428,42078.336,And they are accurate in describes that was calculated based on earlier.,173,,
1244,0.97,42078.336,42085.81,"And $740,000 was based on a cut from FAS and expended Fupds.",173,,
1245,0.97,42085.81,42095.019,"And just note that the assumed salaries savings from the positions was based on six positions, not nine positions based on the work that central staff did.",173,,
1246,0.97,42095.019,42097.021,I wanted to clarify the numbers.,173,,
1247,0.97,42097.021,42097.922,Thank you.,174,,
1248,0.97,42097.922,42098.456,That's important.,174,,
1249,0.97,42098.456,42102.627,"It's not that the numbers weren't accurate, they were delayed.",174,,
1250,0.97,42102.627,42103.194,And here we are.,174,,
1251,0.97,42103.194,42109.5,And we will work to make sure that the numbers are reflected.,174,,
1252,0.97,42109.5,42109.967,Additional follow-up?,174,,
1253,0.97,42109.967,42112.236,I think I'm fine for now.,175,,
1254,0.97,42112.236,42115.139,I may have additional questions after hearing from my colleagues.,175,,
1255,0.97,42115.273,42118.743,Thank you very much for your leadership on the questions.,176,,
1256,0.97,42118.743,42123.648,"Councilmember Morales, I have you up next.",176,,
1257,0.97,42123.648,42124.449,Thank you.,177,,
1258,0.97,42124.449,42131.355,"Well, I have a lot of questions.",177,,
1259,0.97,42131.355,42146.237,"I will try to--I will start on Pge 190 of the--and earlier in the presentation, it says that the unsheltered outreach and response program would be funded by about $7.5 million.",177,,
1260,0.97,42146.237,42153.044,"Here, it shows 1.3 for the team and 1.6 for the service providers.",177,,
1261,0.97,42153.044,42155.48,So apologies if you have explained this.,177,,
1262,0.97,42155.48,42158.683,"But could you clear up the discrepancy, please?",177,,
1263,0.97,42158.683,42158.916,Sure.,178,,
1264,0.97,42158.916,42162.92,"And you know, this slide was an intent to put everything in one place.",178,,
1265,0.97,42162.92,42186.177,"And what you're calling out is at the lead contract, $6.2 million, and the unsheltered outreach response team, $1.3 million, are in one budget area.",178,,
1266,0.97,42186.177,42198.99,"And the remaining funds, which are roughly $3 million, $3.5 million for contracted outreach, those are in the King County regional authority BSL.",178,,
1267,0.97,42198.99,42205.196,And so they're in this total $2.7 million is in two different places in the budget book.,178,,
1268,0.97,42205.196,42208.633,"Here, we were attempting to have one conversation about outreach.",178,,
1269,0.97,42208.633,42211.068,And we put everything in one spot.,178,,
1270,0.97,42211.202,42214.805,Okay.,179,,
1271,0.97,42214.805,42228.286,So what I'm trying to understand candidly is the difference between the navigation team and the new team.,179,,
1272,0.97,42228.286,42239.463,"And it sounds like as part of the plan, I'm interested to know if the city will continue advertising obstruction Removals.",179,,
1273,0.97,42239.463,42244.936,"And if we don't have enough shelter space for folks impacted by that, what happens?",179,,
1274,0.97,42244.936,42267.959,"And if we don't have enough shelter space for that, how does that respond or drive with the decision from Martin V.Boiso.",179,,
1275,0.97,42267.959,42278.636,"On the legal question, that would be best answered as I suggested in my letter, an Execive session with C.O.",180,,
1276,0.97,42278.636,42283.241,And outside counsel.,180,,
1277,0.97,42283.241,42285.843,That's the subject of Federal litigation.,180,,
1278,0.97,42285.843,42286.477,So just say that.,180,,
1279,0.97,42286.477,42291.015,"And Jason, if you want take the other pieces there?",180,,
1280,0.97,42291.148,42292.65,"I have a follow-up question, sorry.",181,,
1281,0.97,42292.65,42303.494,You mentioned at the beginning that--sorry in response to my comment that the navigation team was directed to do outreach and engagement since February.,181,,
1282,0.97,42303.494,42329.186,"I mean, I think that this is a fair question to ask because in response to our concerns that we raised about the navigation team this spring in the midst of Covid and the concern we did not have the shelter space, the use of the navigation team was in direct conflict with what the Cdcs guidance was.",181,,
1283,0.97,42329.186,42337.328,"If we didn't have the shelter to move people into, we should not move people around the city and scattering people to different streets.",181,,
1284,0.97,42337.328,42344.735,So I guess I'm not sure why that question that Councilmember Morales asked cannot be addressed now.,181,,
1285,0.97,42344.735,42354.712,"I'm only responding to her question of how any of the proposing is consistent with the Federal decision in the Boise case, not the other components of the question.",182,,
1286,0.97,42354.712,42357.415,I'm sorry if I wasn't clear on that.,182,,
1287,0.97,42357.415,42361.419,So perhaps I understood the question slightly different.,183,,
1288,0.97,42361.419,42381.539,"If there is not a place to put people into for appropriate shelter, if our congregate shelters with at capacity and we have not opened the Noncongregate shelter that we're excited about, but recognize it's not enough space, what will this team be doing?",183,,
1289,0.97,42381.539,42384.241,"Councilmember Morales, is that a fair question to add?",183,,
1290,0.97,42384.241,42385.209,What we're--.,184,,
1291,0.97,42385.209,42388.145,So the team will continue to make shelter referrals.,185,,
1292,0.97,42388.145,42400.858,And so the navigation team just in the second quarter of 2020 made over 400 referrals to shelter.,185,,
1293,0.97,42400.858,42404.562,This is an 81% increase quarter over quarter.,185,,
1294,0.97,42404.562,42416.44,"And the navigation team, you know, identified 149 Unduplicated enrollments into shelter, also in the second quarter of this year.",185,,
1295,0.97,42416.44,42417.208,That's during this Covid response.,185,,
1296,0.97,42417.208,42423.28,The NAV team has been out in the field connecting people to safe spaces to be.,185,,
1297,0.97,42423.28,42426.684,That is the work that would continue.,185,,
1298,0.97,42426.684,42446.837,"Likewise, during the pandemic, it is the navigation team out in the field making sure that individuals have the equipment, hygiene services, food access, and other service access that they need to stay safe from Covid.",185,,
1299,0.97,42446.837,42458.182,So it is very much an outreach model centered in human service connection for individuals who are experiencing unsheltered homelessness.,185,,
1300,0.97,42458.182,42465.523,And it would really build on the work that we have been doing this year.,185,,
1301,0.97,42465.523,42480.871,"You know, I think in total this year, we have only had seven, I wouldn't quote me on the exact number, but less than ten, you know, Removals.",185,,
1302,0.97,42480.871,42492.55,"And so this is a team who building on the success of this year where we have been deeply engaged with individuals through an outreach strategy, that is the work that would go forward.",185,,
1303,0.97,42492.55,42506.03,"And I think that's the real difference between the, you know, NAV team of 2019 and the NAV team of 2021.",185,,
1304,0.97,42506.03,42506.797,Thank you.,186,,
1305,0.97,42506.797,42512.369,"Council President, you have a follow-up.",186,,
1306,0.97,42512.369,42514.805,"And Council Jb member Morales, do you as well.",186,,
1307,0.97,42514.805,42517.007,I appreciate the opportunity to Interject quickly.,187,,
1308,0.97,42517.007,42520.444,"I'm frustrated with the tone of the exchange, frankly.",187,,
1309,0.97,42520.444,42531.522,"And I think, you know, we are here in earnest to ask questions, to understand policy motivations for the proposals before us.",187,,
1310,0.97,42531.522,42544.969,I believe that Councilmember Morales asked an appropriate question about how the--some of the Federal litigation is Impacting the choices considered here.,187,,
1311,0.97,42544.969,42553.077,"And I don't appreciate Punting this to an executive session, deputy Mayor.",187,,
1312,0.97,42553.077,42578.002,"In the three-page letter that the Durkan administration sent to us on September 30th at 1:40 p.m., out of the three pages, one and a half pages was dedicated to talking about the administration's perspective on the very laws and legal principles that Councilmember Morales is asking you about now in open session.",187,,
1313,0.97,42578.002,42586.51,So I think the public and we as Councilmembers deserve a response to that particular question.,187,,
1314,0.97,42586.51,42594.084,And it's my expectation that that be answered to the extent that you are now claiming Attorney/Client privilege.,187,,
1315,0.97,42594.084,42616.373,"I don't think that's appropriate, given that the administration, again, spent two out of--a page and a half out of three-page letter relying on citations to Hooper versus city of Seattle, to the intersection with the Ndars.",187,,
1316,0.97,42616.373,42629.086,And it appears that the reliance on your interpretation of that--those legal principles is influencing the proposal we are seeing before us.,187,,
1317,0.97,42629.086,42634.658,I take issue with the Deflection here of not wanting to answer that question pointedly.,187,,
1318,0.97,42634.658,42640.698,And I want to support Councilmember Morales' question in that regard.,187,,
1319,0.97,42640.698,42646.971,And I want to request that deputy Mayor answer the question accordingly.,187,,
1320,0.97,42647.104,42647.871,"Thank you, Council President.",188,,
1321,0.97,42647.871,42648.205,Deputy Mayor.,188,,
1322,0.97,42648.205,42664.488,"What I would say, again, is number one, the priority of the then navigation team in 2020 has been to connect individuals to shelter and connect them to Covid-19 resources.",189,,
1323,0.97,42664.488,42682.639,"And as borne out by the data that director Johnson gave you, all right, we have seven from April to I think September, seven, you know, obstruction Removals versus 451 over the same time period a year ago.",189,,
1324,0.97,42682.639,42717.474,"What we are proposing and we think is important for a couple of reasons is to continue to have a centralized manner by which Hsd and the city by extension can coordinate outreach to individuals engaging and experiencing homelessness, coordinate through and with and in partnership are contracted outreach providers in getting people inside.",189,,
1325,0.97,42717.474,42718.575,That is the primary function.,189,,
1326,0.97,42718.575,42724.648,"And part two of that, I guess, would be to answer maybe your question.",189,,
1327,0.97,42724.648,42727.518,And maybe I misunderstood your question.,189,,
1328,0.97,42727.518,42729.42,I apologize if I misinterpreted it.,189,,
1329,0.97,42729.42,42744.334,"We do believe as was said in the letter that, you know, both the decision, you know, the judge's dismissal of the Hooper case was predicated on the existence of the Mdars and having a centralized function of the city.",189,,
1330,0.97,42744.334,42749.273,I would say that we believe that that continues to be an important function.,189,,
1331,0.97,42749.273,42765.322,"As I would say, as I'm trying to state over and over again is the primary function of the team is this year and the year proposing to have it be the primary function of the team is to do the outreach and connection to shelter.",189,,
1332,0.97,42765.322,42778.135,"And Councilmember Mosqueda, to your point, we're not proposing, you know, we are all--this budget is predicated in the idea we will continue to be in the middle of a pandemic through 2021.",189,,
1333,0.97,42778.135,42786.343,"And therefore, you know, the ability for us to--our primary function is to keep people safe and get them inside.",189,,
1334,0.97,42786.343,42799.223,"That coupled with the investments we're proposing for the use of hotel rooms as an example, which I know has been a priority for the Council for several months now, I think is part of the entire effort.",189,,
1335,0.97,42799.223,42819.643,"You know, we're doubling the amount of money we're spending on this from $40 million to $80 million as a steward of Federal funds and the contracting agent to the contract outreach providers, we think it's important from an oversight perspective to have the centralized coordination at the city.",189,,
1336,0.97,42819.643,42822.946,"Again, go back to 2017, that did not exist.",189,,
1337,0.97,42823.08,42829.286,If I could get an answer to the three questions I posed.,190,,
1338,0.97,42829.286,42833.79,Will we continue the practice of Priorizing obstruction Removals?,190,,
1339,0.97,42833.79,42839.196,Will we fund enough shelter space to relocate people impacted by that?,190,,
1340,0.97,42839.196,42847.371,"And if we can't do that, how are we consistent with Martin versus the city?",190,,
1341,0.97,42847.371,42848.805,Those are my three questions.,190,,
1342,0.97,42848.805,42851.375,I'm not trying to be defensive.,191,,
1343,0.97,42851.375,42853.944,I don't understand the first question.,191,,
1344,0.97,42854.077,42866.089,"So we have--the referrals that we have made, it's still not clear how many folks went into shelter.",192,,
1345,0.97,42866.089,42871.695,"People were 97%, I believe of the Removals were declared obstruction.",192,,
1346,0.97,42871.695,42875.365,"To me, we are Prioritizing that category as reasons to move people.",192,,
1347,0.97,42875.365,42877.935,Will we continue to do that?,192,,
1348,0.97,42877.935,42883.207,"Will this team, whatever it is, navigation or outreach, is that a priority in how they make the decisions?",192,,
1349,0.97,42883.34,42911.468,"I thought I answered the question by stating that this year in 2020, we have only made seven Removals while--during the Covid pandemic.",193,,
1350,0.97,42911.468,42923.18,That is an example of the continued work that this team would do in 2021 where they would not be conducting Forcibl Removals.,193,,
1351,0.97,42923.18,42930.053,They would be trying to build connections to needed services.,193,,
1352,0.97,42930.053,42936.526,And so the priority will remain the public health and public safety of individuals in Encampments and the public.,193,,
1353,0.97,42936.526,42946.703,But it will be through a different strategy of service connection and service support that we will try and find solutions.,193,,
1354,0.97,42946.837,42949.539,Okay.,194,,
1355,0.97,42949.539,42955.045,"Councilmember--chair Mosqueda, if it's okay, I'll move on to the last couple of questions.",194,,
1356,0.97,42955.045,42956.947,So one is about staffing.,194,,
1357,0.97,42956.947,42960.817,Why does this team need a dedicated communications manager?,194,,
1358,0.97,42960.817,42974.264,And why do we need two systems navigators when we have contracted with organizations that do outreach with our Unhoused community and bring a lot of experience in doing this?,194,,
1359,0.97,42974.264,42975.065,So that's kind of one question.,194,,
1360,0.97,42975.065,42977.134,.,194,,
1361,0.97,42977.134,42977.601,Yeah.,195,,
1362,0.97,42977.601,42981.238,And then let me finish up and then I'll be done.,196,,
1363,0.97,42981.238,42988.545,One criticism of the NAV team was that we heard from service providers that there was a bottleneck at the referral point.,196,,
1364,0.97,42988.545,43007.864,So I don't understand why we can't just train providers on the city's referral process and the NAV App and other tools we have and allow them to do direct shelter referral to clear up the bottleneck.,196,,
1365,0.97,43007.864,43008.565,Great.,197,,
1366,0.97,43008.565,43011.001,So the communications person is critically important to this team.,197,,
1367,0.97,43011.001,43025.983,"I have to assume that each of your offices get the same number of Inquires about unsheltered individuals and the impacts of Encampments, as do we.",197,,
1368,0.97,43025.983,43031.488,There is a lot of constituent communication that needs to be managed.,197,,
1369,0.97,43031.488,43039.83,"Likewise, this Council asks for a lot of information about our outreach efforts and about our efforts to address unsheltered homelessness.",197,,
1370,0.97,43039.83,43048.772,We need to have a level of staffing that can make sure that information is flowing back and forth.,197,,
1371,0.97,43048.772,43063.92,We also have a public and a media who is always asking questions about efforts and asking questions about certain Encampments that are peppered throughout the city.,197,,
1372,0.97,43063.92,43078.802,"We need to have a single point of contact for the public to be able to get information to, one, hear from them, but two, to get information back out.",197,,
1373,0.97,43078.802,43093.183,So that communications role paired with the data analysts are critically important for us to continue to respond to all of the Inquires that come from a variety of different populations.,197,,
1374,0.97,43093.183,43100.857,"I think, you know, just this year, we have received well over 500 Inquires.",197,,
1375,0.97,43100.857,43110.567,That is not including the number of Inquires that come in reporting the impact of homelessness through the customer service Bureau.,197,,
1376,0.97,43110.567,43117.574,And so there's a flood of inquire that we need data analysts and the communication manager.,197,,
1377,0.97,43117.874,43150.874,These are very well-trained individuals who have a career out in if the field doing outreach to homeless individuals.,197,,
1378,0.97,43151.108,43161.184,Thanks.,197,,
1379,0.97,43198.154,43214.204,I still want to go to one of the questions that is not being answered so I will ask it a different way and hope that there will be an answer to the question and I am also going to ask that you don't interrupt me as I am asking the question.,197,,
1380,0.97,43214.204,43234.09,There have been several occasions where director Johnson you and deputy Mayor Kitzwelller have interrupted so I want you to take a pause.,197,,
1381,0.97,43234.09,43270.927,"The question that we have not got an answer to in terms of the 2021 outreach strategy on slide number 9, I would like to get an understanding of whether or not any dollars will be used for purposes of clearing obstructions or any other type of Unsanctioned encampment as defined?",197,,
1382,0.97,43270.927,43272.796,If I can ask the question back to you.,198,,
1383,0.97,43272.796,43285.075,You are asking if any of the dollars can be used towards encampment or obstruction removal in its simple form.,198,,
1384,0.97,43285.075,43287.611,The answer is yes.,199,,
1385,0.97,43287.611,43289.779,Consistent with the M dares.,200,,
1386,0.97,43289.779,43292.449,So I suppose I wasn't asking if it could be.,201,,
1387,0.97,43292.449,43298.855,I am asking if they will be.,201,,
1388,0.97,43298.855,43307.831,So if the Council APPROVES the $10.7 millions as proposed on slide nine and makes no changes.,201,,
1389,0.97,43307.831,43316.206,Will the dollars be utilized for purposes of clearing Unsanctioned Encampments consistent with the N Darness.,201,,
1390,0.97,43316.206,43325.281,"If you are asking me to make a commitment we won't conduct any type of encampment or construction renewal, the answer is no.",202,,
1391,0.97,43325.281,43330.987,I am not asking for a commitment.,203,,
1392,0.97,43330.987,43349.572,"I am asking whether or not the 2021 strategy as proposed on slide nine, will any of those dollars be utilized for purposes of clearing Unsanctioned Encampments consistent with the M Dar?",203,,
1393,0.97,43349.572,43349.806,Yes.,204,,
1394,0.97,43349.806,43351.541,Okay.,204,,
1395,0.97,43351.541,43360.817,How many of the $10.7 millions will be utilized for purposes of clearing Unsanctioned Encampments consistent with the N dares?,204,,
1396,0.97,43360.817,43365.655,I have no way of answer that question.,205,,
1397,0.97,43365.655,43368.892,Why are you unable to answer that question?,206,,
1398,0.97,43368.892,43381.404,I think the question presumes we have in our head a back of the napkin number of Encampments to be removed or obstructions to be removed and I just don't--I don't have that.,207,,
1399,0.97,43381.404,43402.058,"I would say also, you know, part of what we are proposing to do here is really start to rethink and Reengaged in a new way with our contracted outreach providers.",207,,
1400,0.97,43402.058,43429.085,And I think again our operating posture because of Covid and we are learning from this is how we can lead with engagement in a different way and what we have proposed here and in partnership with the PDA and others an opportunity for us to really rethink how and where we do that and how we utilize each resources.,207,,
1401,0.97,43429.085,43466.689,And that may be not a defined answer but I am really committed to having that discussion and seeing how we can really work to move to--not just engage people but get people inside and that is not just done by structured removal because we need to offer shelter for people it is engaging some of our more challenging areas around the city.,207,,
1402,0.97,43466.689,43493.883,But I think we are proposing in '21 to utilize resources and do and work in coordination with whether it is our city team or if perhaps best led by a partner organization to do that kind of engagement and that is--I am fully admitting that is a different approach than we have taken historically.,207,,
1403,0.97,43493.883,43516.272,"In responding to what I think Council has clearly articulated, not just recently but certainly over the past year plus, what we are hearing from our own contracting--contracted agencies and what we have been seeing first hand these several months in this Covid environment, is opportunity and the need for us to rethink.",207,,
1404,0.97,43516.272,43547.303,"I don't know if that answers your question but I really mean that in full transparency and honesty that we are trying to embrace change and again a team that is less than it was before, that doesn't have--is not acknowledging that you know SPD is a full time member of it and requiring us to take a different approach and that is what we are proposing is to try to attempt that and beginning in 2021.",207,,
1405,0.97,43547.303,43563.586,A lot of conversation that needs to occur this fall so if Council to your point does accept this proposal that we are ready to execute that at the beginning of the year.,207,,
1406,0.97,43563.586,43570.46,"Council President I appreciate your line of question, do you have any follow-up?",208,,
1407,0.97,43570.46,43572.729,Not at this time.,209,,
1408,0.97,43572.729,43573.997,Councilmember Peterson.,209,,
1409,0.97,43573.997,43574.697,Please go ahead.,209,,
1410,0.97,43574.697,43576.533,Thank you.,210,,
1411,0.97,43576.533,43604.727,I want to thank Councilmember Lewis and Gonzelez on their leadership on the homelessness authority looking forward as that is stood up and staffed and we see the reinvestment resources going there and dealing with homelessness regionally.,210,,
1412,0.97,43604.727,43624.614,"I want to thank deputy Kitzwelller and John Simmons, overall this whole strategy of the surge in assistance for experiencing homelessness, I think is still digging into the details and questions coming up here but to me personally it is strategic and sensible.",210,,
1413,0.97,43624.614,43633.556,I get a lot of constituents for increase in unauthorized Encampments.,210,,
1414,0.97,43633.556,43650.006,I want to thank the hard working dedicated team of city employees that have been engaged and trying to offer shelter and services and about the improved results.,210,,
1415,0.97,43650.006,43679.402,"In looking at this slide, this streamlined outreach and response team, I'm glad to see that for the 9.4 million we do have a team of city government employees that will be the idea is to coordinate and oversee these operations and to analyze the data and to respond to communication requests and so I appreciate the questions also from my colleagues.",210,,
1416,0.97,43679.402,43688.711,"In addition to obstructions, I know that you know I have heard a will the about fire hazards as well.",210,,
1417,0.97,43688.711,43708.364,"So again, I strongly support having city government employees in a leadership role here with the city tax dollars going out to highly skilled outreach Nonprofits so I just want to thank you all for this presentation and I may have follow-up questions later.",210,,
1418,0.97,43708.364,43709.198,Thank you.,210,,
1419,0.97,43709.198,43710.667,"Thank you, Councilmember Peterson.",211,,
1420,0.97,43710.667,43717.64,"Not seeing any additional hands, I do have a few concluding comments here.",211,,
1421,0.97,43717.64,43744.701,"I want to reiterate the importance of the language that we did pass in this summer and early fall action confirmed with central staff and our legal team that there is nothing that prohibits the city from continuing to protect public Afety, address fire hazards, and make sure that there is no crime happening that is one thing that I think has been put out there and want to make sure that we put that issue to rest absolutely.",211,,
1422,0.97,43744.701,43757.447,"There is still the ability for our city personnel to address crimes and those types of hazards, I want to reiterate my appreciation for the presentation today.",211,,
1423,0.97,43757.447,43758.981,Obviously there will be Follow- up questions.,211,,
1424,0.97,43758.981,43761.484,You heard a number of questions today.,211,,
1425,0.97,43761.484,43774.397,We look forward to continuing to learn more about the proposal in front of us and want to make sure that we get the chance to follow up with you on those questions.,211,,
1426,0.97,43774.397,43797.286,"And, yes, thank you, director Johnson, if we could see that next slide that would be good for the public and as we Transi want to let the know that the Department of housing we still have 35 minutes to your presentation and if we need to carry over happy to do.",211,,
1427,0.97,43797.286,43798.855,Director Johnson is there anything on this slide?,211,,
1428,0.97,43798.855,43802.558,"No, we have covered much of it in earlier questioning.",212,,
1429,0.97,43802.558,43819.442,I just want to reiterate that we are preparing to transition both the contracts over to the regional authority when the regional authority is ready.,212,,
1430,0.97,43819.442,43823.379,And as Council President Gonzelez mentioned.,212,,
1431,0.97,43823.379,43829.252,The Ceo hiring is expected to result in a new leader in January.,212,,
1432,0.97,43829.252,43833.589,That leader has 60 days to submit a staffing plan.,212,,
1433,0.97,43833.589,43838.761,That staffing plan will guide when we will conduct transitions.,212,,
1434,0.97,43838.761,43841.864,So I think much of that was discussed earlier.,212,,
1435,0.97,43841.864,43848.604,Appreciate you bringing that up so we can have that in our mind as we can go out to 2021 budget.,213,,
1436,0.97,43848.604,43868.491,"And I will also say that a number of the questions that were raised about this newly proposed navigation or outreach team, for me it is going to be important to know how and if this is separate or Dovetails with that new entity so we will follow up on that.",213,,
1437,0.97,43868.491,43902.558,"I would like to follow up with you specifically about whether or not there is budgetary items that we need to think about in this year's budget, I'm sorry, in 2021's budget to address the coordination among service providers given the changing nature of Covid and I think of the possibility of increased need given many people are unemployed and rent is going to at some point become due even for those that have been able to have the protections from the Eviction Preventions strategy.",213,,
1438,0.97,43902.558,43907.23,We know that many people are racking up bills and they do not have the possibility of employment.,213,,
1439,0.97,43907.23,43914.704,I'm very concerned about the possibility of a surge in homelessness and increasing housing instability.,213,,
1440,0.97,43914.704,43918.274,We do need to have greater coordination among service providers.,213,,
1441,0.97,43918.274,43947.837,"Look forward to learning more from you and again this is not about you or any one individual amongst your team but if there is a strategy that we need to fund or ensure that there is funding to support I'd be very interested by way of reference some of the comments that I received about the lack of coordination among service providers, no one has reached out and difficult or impossible to connect.",213,,
1442,0.97,43947.837,43952.174,Not aware of sustained communication with service providers.,213,,
1443,0.97,43952.174,43962.251,"It's important to know that engagement is happening One-On- one and what we need is effective communication in the systems, a true systems response.",213,,
1444,0.97,43962.251,43990.446,Folks are frustrated about Hack of meaningful communication engagement that requires us to work together and implement strategies with one individual One-On-One and the flu season is on top of that and I will look forward to working with you.,213,,
1445,0.97,43990.446,43991.08,"With that, any comments?",213,,
1446,0.97,43991.08,43992.515,"Council President, please take us home.",213,,
1447,0.97,43992.515,43994.216,Thank you so much.,214,,
1448,0.97,43994.216,43999.288,"On this particular slide ten, I do think that it is worth spending more time on this.",214,,
1449,0.97,43999.288,44004.927,Unfortunately we are out of time today.,214,,
1450,0.97,44004.927,44034.223,But this is obviously a sizeable amount of money and there are a lot of intersections here between Council's budget appropriation authority and the context of the local agreement and the bylaws that are hopefully going to get approved in the next governing committee meeting of the regional homelessness.,214,,
1451,0.97,44034.223,44102.825,I just want to flag for you chair Moskita and director John Somefit that it may merit more attention in terms of digging into the details and Unfortunately I recognize we just don't have the time to do that today but don't want to lose the thread of the need to have a deeper conversation about this particularly as it relates to some of the issues that some members of the previous Council have expressed related to how budget decisions are processed and made in the regional homelessness authority and budget appropriate authority is really the only power that we have at the city of Seattle and at the Seattle city council level in terms of influencing adoption data driven approaches throughout the regional system that we are seeking to create.,214,,
1452,0.97,44102.825,44103.759,"Thank you, chair.",214,,
1453,0.97,44103.759,44107.029,"Thank you, Council President.",215,,
1454,0.97,44107.029,44113.602,Dually noted and we will follow up with you.,215,,
1455,0.97,44113.602,44114.737,Councilmembers appreciate your time and questions.,215,,
1456,0.97,44114.737,44129.485,"Director, Julie and team, thank you for being with us for the majority of this morning, we are going to transition over to office of housing but we will follow up with you on the Council of President's request for maybe more details behind that slide.",215,,
1457,0.97,44129.485,44130.686,Appreciate your time this morning.,215,,
1458,0.97,44130.686,44133.255,And you take care.,215,,
1459,0.97,44133.255,44134.39,"Thank you, Joe as well.",216,,
1460,0.97,44134.39,44134.89,"Thanks, everybody.",217,,
1461,0.97,44134.89,44140.596,Madam clerk can you read into the record item number two.,218,,
1462,0.97,44140.596,44141.63,Agenda item two.,219,,
1463,0.97,44141.63,44148.37,Office of housing for briefing and discussion.,219,,
1464,0.97,44148.37,44167.99,Good afternoon and Arado I saw you late on the interview that folks were having in the community about the ongoing civil rights uprising and really appreciate your comments on converge media and I thought about you late and coming back Online.,220,,
1465,0.97,44167.99,44172.394,Why don folks introduce themselves and we jump into this.,220,,
1466,0.97,44172.394,44173.362,Good morning.,221,,
1467,0.97,44173.362,44178.367,Thank you and Councilmembers thanks for having us today.,221,,
1468,0.97,44178.367,44242.431,"I'm Emily Alvarado the director of housing and Becky Garra the Finance manager of office of housing and pleased to present to you the proposed budget for 2021, just to let you know what you are about to see is pretty limited in that the office of housing essentially has functionally zero general fund dollars included in our 2021 budget and because of that, we are going to talk a lot about how much of our budget action are technical changes and Becky will walk you all through those and I will take a slightly higher level description talking more about what our core revenue are and what our core expenditures are on an annual basis, cover Rsji and our commitment to racial equity and I know have you asked questions in the last presentation related to acquisition and I would be happy to answer those and any other questions you have then.",221,,
1469,0.97,44242.431,44247.036,"That sounds great, thank you and on the original calendar we had you slated for 15 minutes.",222,,
1470,0.97,44247.036,44256.211,We need a full hour but we are going to try to do 15 minutes and 15 minutes of questions.,222,,
1471,0.97,44256.211,44257.379,Appreciate your flexibility with us.,222,,
1472,0.97,44257.379,44257.746,Absolutely.,223,,
1473,0.97,44257.746,44266.889,And I'm sorry to do this but am I supposed to share the presentation?,223,,
1474,0.97,44266.889,44272.394,Chairman Mosqueda I am trying to find the name of the person to share and it was on the executive side.,224,,
1475,0.97,44272.394,44280.469,I can share it if you want but it will take me a second to pull up the presentation?,224,,
1476,0.97,44280.469,44286.809,That would be awesome Ali.,224,,
1477,0.97,44286.809,44288.877,I didn't recognize that part.,224,,
1478,0.97,44288.877,44290.079,Sorry about the confusion.,224,,
1479,0.97,44290.079,44293.782,It was that Becky would run the presentation.,224,,
1480,0.97,44293.782,44294.116,I'm sorry.,225,,
1481,0.97,44294.116,44294.683,I didn't realize that.,225,,
1482,0.97,44294.683,44304.426,"This is life in the time of Covid so it is absolutely fine and Patty, thank you identifying the folks to do that.",226,,
1483,0.97,44304.426,44306.462,"Becky, will you do that or is Ali going to?",226,,
1484,0.97,44306.462,44309.031,I can do my best here.,227,,
1485,0.97,44309.031,44311.967,"Ali, if you have it handy, let's see.",227,,
1486,0.97,44311.967,44313.068,I will do my best.,227,,
1487,0.97,44313.068,44324.213,"It, can you make sure that both Becky and I have the ability to share so that whichever one of us can do it quickly.",228,,
1488,0.97,44324.213,44327.916,Becky has been given permission.,229,,
1489,0.97,44327.916,44328.183,Okay.,230,,

1492,0.97,44328.884,44338.16,"Thanks, Becky and director Alvarado if you want to initiate your comments if that will be pulled up, that will be great.",231,,
1493,0.97,44338.16,44338.527,Sure.,232,,
1494,0.97,44338.527,44338.827,Absolutely.,232,,
1495,0.97,44338.827,44343.165,Becky was going to do the first slide.,232,,
1496,0.97,44343.165,44344.133,I'm sorry about this.,233,,
1497,0.97,44344.133,44358.914,Which really demonstrates that our primary issues that are coming before you in 2021 are technical in nature.,234,,
1498,0.97,44358.914,44361.183,"Becky, do you want me to take over.",234,,
1499,0.97,44361.183,44366.789,I would be happy to but I am having trouble pulling it up to share the screen.,235,,
1500,0.97,44366.789,44367.056,Okay.,236,,
1501,0.97,44367.056,44369.324,"Guys, I will pull it up.",236,,
1502,0.97,44369.324,44370.459,I got it.,236,,
1503,0.97,44370.459,44378.1,You can go ahead Becky and we will get this pulled up.,236,,
1504,0.97,44378.1,44380.869,Apologies about that.,237,,
1505,0.97,44380.869,44394.983,So our primary action that you will see of our technical adjustment is the removal of one time 2020 ads.,237,,
1506,0.97,44394.983,44409.698,"We had the local sales tax on the capital investment side and those with other things, when you remove those out from the 2021 baseline, that is the reduction of 49 Million- dollars.",237,,
1507,0.97,44409.698,44415.237,Should I wait or --,237,,
1508,0.97,44415.237,44416.672,Keep going.,238,,
1509,0.97,44416.672,44416.939,Okay.,239,,
1510,0.97,44416.939,44427.549,"The second technical adjustment is standard for cost changes and $233,000 and that is something that impacts all of the departments and inflation and central cost changes.",239,,
1511,0.97,44427.549,44439.862,The third one is something that will not show as discrete budget change because it is net zero but that is the swap of all of our general fund for O H resources.,239,,
1512,0.97,44439.862,44446.535,We have all general fund out of the baseline budget.,239,,
1513,0.97,44446.535,44455.711,And we are instead using balances from Mha primarily and a little bit of levy.,239,,
1514,0.97,44455.711,44461.016,The Admin portion of those revenues.,239,,
1515,0.97,44461.016,44468.157,The 4TH thing is the adjustment of our authority maintenance subsides.,239,,
1516,0.97,44468.157,44484.139,We have a commitment to our homeless house that we have invested into provide Omn subsidies and the technical adjustments is a Tweak of that dollar amount representing new projects for 2020 and 2021.,239,,
1517,0.97,44484.139,44492.381,"And if we can two to the next slide, so what I just talked about is summarized here.",239,,
1518,0.97,44492.381,44497.486,You will see I talk about how all general fund has been removed from our base.,239,,
1519,0.97,44497.486,44505.36,What you see here is the jump start for the Covid related mortgage assistance.,239,,
1520,0.97,44505.36,44512.401,So the base general fund is still zero and we have this 350 at jump start.,239,,
1521,0.97,44512.401,44525.247,"The next slide is the other appropriation, this is really our budget and here is where you see the change from the 2020 adopt to the 2021 proposed.",239,,
1522,0.97,44525.247,44526.682,You see the one time ads coming out.,239,,
1523,0.97,44526.682,44528.884,That is where the change is.,239,,
1524,0.97,44528.884,44533.388,You will see the change from the 2020 revised as that is even larger.,239,,
1525,0.97,44533.388,44557.346,"That is the changes we just talked about from the adopted as well as one time things that were added in the 2ND quarter supplemental like the 25 Million-Dollars of Reit authority that we have investigated 2020 and the four million dollars of rent assistance and the Fies are the same, no change there.",239,,
1526,0.97,44557.346,44565.12,So with that I can turn it over to Emily to talk about the more interesting things.,239,,
1527,0.97,44565.12,44569.725,"And again, I'm sorry about the technical glitches.",240,,
1528,0.97,44569.725,44587.643,So as Becky explained I think the primary story as it related to revenues for the office of housing are more related to our Nongeneral fund resources.,240,,
1529,0.97,44587.643,44597.953,And I wanted to overview those briefly on analyzed basis.,240,,
1530,0.97,44597.953,44611.466,The housing levy passed in 2016 passed and will expire in 2023 and we have four million dollars to invest in for multi Capitol preservation.,240,,
1531,0.97,44611.466,44622.778,There is some for our operations and maintenance subsides for units that have already been invested in on the Capitol side and are already open and operating.,240,,
1532,0.97,44622.778,44637.893,"1.6 million goes to the human services Department for homelessness prevention and our home ownership Capitol funds, administration all coming from the housing levy.",240,,
1533,0.97,44637.893,44642.931,Our other significant revenues include mandatory housing program payments.,240,,
1534,0.97,44642.931,44645.434,We budget this annually at 28 Million-Dollars.,240,,
1535,0.97,44645.434,44668.19,"However, I do want to express that there is significant fluctuations in this source as you know this is based on the development cycle all indications currently have us continuing to secure Mha however it is possible that it does not come in at the amount that is budgeted.",240,,
1536,0.97,44668.19,44670.459,We also receive Weatherization grants.,240,,
1537,0.97,44670.459,44684.506,"The bulk of that, the approximately 50% for our critical Weatherization work is from Seattle city light, the remainder is pass through from the Department of Commerce at the state that includes Federal resources.",240,,
1538,0.97,44684.506,44691.98,Our Federal grants that we get directly include home and Cbg.,240,,
1539,0.97,44691.98,44700.889,The majority of those resources get invested in multi Capitol and some are in interest earnings and fees in 2.65 million.,240,,
1540,0.97,44700.889,44713.235,On the next slide you will see how annually we invest that and I think that the primary take away on this slide that you will see is that we do not sit on resource.,240,,
1541,0.97,44713.235,44716.104,"For the annual resources that come in, they are extended.",240,,
1542,0.97,44716.104,44722.344,"In this year, for example, we have put out two Novas.",240,,
1543,0.97,44722.344,44730.886,A spring and fall Nova utilizing the Mha resources and were able to do that because the Mha payment came in higher than expected.,240,,
1544,0.97,44730.886,44741.163,"We also invested I should say, you might say where is the outcome of that spring Nova and we will be making our annual investment announcements at the end of the year.",240,,
1545,0.97,44741.163,44755.644,We also had a permanent support of housing Nova as I know million and in order to achieve that higher than annual amount of levy funds for that investment.,240,,
1546,0.97,44755.644,44763.018,"We took two years of levy, Essentil forward committing a levy year to make it be responsive to Covid.",240,,
1547,0.97,44763.018,44775.897,We will note that means that a future levy year will not be available to address in that year so that we were able to make this significant investment in permanent support of housing.,240,,
1548,0.97,44775.897,44780.302,We have been making more investments in homeownership that we did previously.,240,,
1549,0.97,44780.302,44793.248,We did a spring and have opened a fall Nova for Capitol investments as we scale up the work on creating permanently created home ownership.,240,,
1550,0.97,44793.248,44798.553,I want to note the home Weatherization and home repair grant team.,240,,
1551,0.97,44798.553,44825.28,"It is our focus and belief that we must keep our workers and low income homeowners and Renters safe during the time of Covid, the team has been able to adapt safety measures including virtual home Audits to provide continued service during Covid so we are ex pending on par with what we expected that we would have about this space.",240,,
1552,0.97,44825.28,44836.892,Especially now it is really important that as people are home they are living in comfort and safety and I'm proud of the work that the team has been able to do to continue that service.,240,,
1553,0.97,44836.892,44870.859,We are continuing investment in operation and maintenance subsidies and obviously we have a significant pipeline and more units opening that are providing support of housing and so that O and M subsidy gets expended and the last line is staffing and administration just being clear that they are full Department wide costs for all that we do outside of direct Capitol investments.,240,,
1554,0.97,44870.859,44885.64,I mentioned a few things on the last slide that we did Un2020 that we will do in 2021 that demonstrate that we intend to put racial equity at the focus and center of all we do.,241,,
1555,0.97,44885.64,44925.58,The PHS pilot is in part in tended to respond to the fact that there is significant disproportionate amounts of homelessness and we want to make sure it is Strategyically on communities of color and on home ownership expenditure that is through the levy resources about 10 Million-Dollars from our $295 million levy that we were Additionally awarded 10 million from the mercy sale that we are investing in home ownership.,241,,
1556,0.97,44925.58,44955.777,"A real focus to work to close the racial gap that exist our work will continue sustainable of home ownership, a real piece of the race the equity work making sure that we don't lose ground on the House holds that are able to own their home at this time.",241,,
1557,0.97,44955.777,44956.278,Finally Covid response.,241,,
1558,0.97,44956.278,44959.581,This is summarizing the longer presentation I think last week to Council.,241,,
1559,0.97,44959.581,44964.653,I hope I was able to answer questions then and happy to do more here.,241,,
1560,0.97,44964.653,44975.797,"The primary Covid response that we are involved in, is as it relates to rental assistance and supports for low income homeowners.",241,,
1561,0.97,44975.797,44998.92,"On rental assistance, although we did present a more complete package that is a larger sum of rental assistance dollars that are deployed over three strategies, what you see here is the direct assistance that gets routed through the office of housing which was a combined 1.4 million and virtually from CDBG and Scen 4 Million- dollars of Crf funds.",241,,
1562,0.97,44998.92,45012.5,"That is the am that we are administering directly to tenants that reside in office of housing funded apartments, rent and income restricted apartments and that's the program.",241,,
1563,0.97,45012.5,45027.115,The other funds do route through the human services Department to provide contracts to our homelessness providers and the United way and that is not reflected in our budget.,241,,
1564,0.97,45027.115,45057.545,"What is reflected in our budget and Becky talked about the $700,000 or the $300,000 that you saw is the Homeowner stabilization programs that we are doing two things, one we are doing more support for the Washington homeownership resource center to provide counseling and provide and to more closure prevention support through Homesite.",241,,
1565,0.97,45057.545,45062.751,And I think that is the conclusion of our presentation.,241,,
1566,0.97,45062.751,45066.788,"Again, light on specific budget details but I'm happy to answer any broader questions.",241,,
1567,0.97,45066.788,45074.796,I can jump into talk about acquisition unless you would like to ask the question any particular way Council chair.,241,,
1568,0.97,45074.796,45078.066,I will go over to the summary sheet just to keep it there for a reference.,242,,
1569,0.97,45078.066,45090.311,"Just want to say thank you for walking through that, Becky, about the power point presentation, that was helpful to have you walk through that.",242,,
1570,0.97,45090.311,45090.545,Hello.,242,,
1571,0.97,45090.545,45093.081,Here for the hard questions.,243,,
1572,0.97,45093.081,45093.348,Good.,244,,
1573,0.97,45093.348,45094.649,Q and a time.,244,,
1574,0.97,45094.649,45102.457,"So, yes, there were a number of questions director Alvarado if you would like to address those.",244,,
1575,0.97,45102.457,45114.903,Is there funding from the office of housing specific to the levy so we could purchase hotels and other acquisition funds to be used for vacant hotels and motel and apartments.,244,,
1576,0.97,45114.903,45125.814,"The second question I heard was well I will throw this in, rapid Rehousing in that previous presentation from director Johnson, there was a slide on the rapid Rehousing investments.",244,,
1577,0.97,45125.814,45135.156,One of the questions that we had is who is managing that and how do those dollars get out and how fast can that happen in terms of the Rsp process I think are the two questions I heard so far.,244,,
1578,0.97,45135.156,45138.193,I can start on the first one if you would like.,245,,
1579,0.97,45138.193,45150.205,We do not have a discrete pot of money for acquisition but we have the authority to use funds that are not needed in the short-term for a short term purposes like acquisition.,245,,
1580,0.97,45150.205,45155.677,So we have the authority to use 30 Million-Dollars of our O and M trust fund.,245,,
1581,0.97,45155.677,45162.25,Our maintenance funds that are needed in future years but not needed in the short-term.,245,,
1582,0.97,45162.25,45172.427,Of that authority we are currently--we currently have some outstanding loans and so we have 16-And-A-Half million available.,245,,
1583,0.97,45172.427,45178.533,But we are finalizing two loans right now that will use another 9.5.,245,,
1584,0.97,45178.533,45184.873,So our available balance will be about 7 million right now from that 30 Million-Dollar pot.,245,,
1585,0.97,45184.873,45196.317,"The important thing is that when these loans are repaid, I'm going to do air quotes, they are not really repaid, they are typically converted into permanent longer-term financing.",245,,
1586,0.97,45196.317,45200.588,"And Emily, I don't know if you want to speak more to that.",245,,
1587,0.97,45200.588,45201.623,Sure.,246,,
1588,0.97,45201.623,45205.827,So I think you all have heard about our programs.,246,,
1589,0.97,45205.827,45206.461,Sometimes they carry the name.,246,,
1590,0.97,45206.461,45214.936,We have a bridge loan product and then we also have an acquisition and preservation program.,246,,
1591,0.97,45214.936,45222.777,And both of these as Becky mentioned are short-term lending of our money that is needed in the future.,246,,
1592,0.97,45222.777,45234.956,"So what we looked at are a few things, one, we look at having the available cash on hand to be able to make those investments and as Becky said, we do have available cash to make those investments.",246,,
1593,0.97,45234.956,45245.667,But what we also look at is to the extent that the things that our partners acquire we will be be the predicted take out financing.,246,,
1594,0.97,45245.667,45266.588,We want to make sure we are making loans where the long- term financing is Knowable and because we are near the latter half of the housing levy there is some point that we more assessment of risk to make those loans of which we believe that he we're the permanent financing.,246,,
1595,0.97,45266.588,45281.703,"All of that said the clear answer to your question is, yes, our funding can be used to acquire hotels so long as the long term use of that property is for permanent housing.",246,,
1596,0.97,45281.703,45294.482,And I know in some cases he tells would either need Rehab or other kinds of modifications to Bake it a permanent housing type.,246,,
1597,0.97,45294.482,45304.459,Our acquisition loans depending if it is a bridge loan or a and P loan is a 20 or 50 year regulatory agreement that requires that the converted ultimate use be permanent housing.,246,,
1598,0.97,45304.459,45323.911,"So long as that is the setup, then there is, we do a rolling basis for acquisition loans and accept those loans so long as we have the available cash and the available authority and have the level of confidence about what the permanent funding is.",246,,
1599,0.97,45323.911,45340.561,I know that will be welcome news to many of our Councilmembers and Council Juarez that will help to answer the second question earlier.,247,,
1600,0.97,45340.561,45348.636,Did you want to answer the second question and I will turn to couple Peterson?,248,,
1601,0.97,45348.636,45348.903,Sure.,249,,
1602,0.97,45348.903,45367.288,"Rapid Rehousing while I can't speak specifically to how that rapid Rehousing will be invested, what I can say that in terms of the available units and available partners, we know that the city has made an investment for several years now in housing Connector.",249,,
1603,0.97,45367.288,45377.765,And housing Connector has helped develop systems to support the utilization of rapid Rehousing in an effective way and it requires several things.,249,,
1604,0.97,45377.765,45418.706,"It requires available units and willing landlords and the appropriate amount of subsidy to be sure that we can support the tenants and housing Connector has made agreements with a range of housing providers, some of who are in the housing portfolio including community housing and mercy housing Northwest for example, and where they can provide access to units for clients that are using a rapid housing resource and housing Connectors made it to private market landlords and we continue to explore ways to use any potential vacancies in Mfte to support that and have the conversations going.",249,,
1605,0.97,45418.706,45438.893,"I think the impetus of the question is wanting to know if we had existing organization that will be working on the rapid Rehousing investments that we saw on the slide and how fast the dollars can get out, was it going to involve Resty Rfp process and when can we anticipate the funds getting out.",250,,
1606,0.97,45438.893,45447.301,If you don't have the answers to those questions and want to work in partnership with the agency and get back to us that is fine as well but love housing Connector.,250,,
1607,0.97,45447.301,45452.039,Fit is that entity that is great and the question was the timing.,250,,
1608,0.97,45452.039,45452.34,Got it.,251,,
1609,0.97,45452.34,45460.348,I am sorry I don't have exactly that information and I will follow up with you and full council with that information.,251,,
1610,0.97,45460.348,45461.949,We appreciate that.,252,,
1611,0.97,45461.949,45464.819,"Councilmember Peterson, please go ahead.",252,,
1612,0.97,45464.819,45469.957,Thank you chairman Mosqueda and director Alvarado.,253,,
1613,0.97,45469.957,45476.631,I was interested in the 20 Million-Dollar estimate for the Mha funds.,253,,
1614,0.97,45476.631,45478.499,Is that based on historical data?,253,,
1615,0.97,45478.499,45508.663,"I guess what I'm interested in, is it based on the old Council of the 50% building on-site and 50% paying in L I Eu or a historical number that may show in L I Eu 50%.",253,,
1616,0.97,45508.663,45514.702,It has fluctuated wildly and imperfect estimate but based on historical numbers.,254,,
1617,0.97,45514.702,45525.646,"If I may follow up, so is that--I mean that's something we can work through central staff to maybe do a deeper dive on.",255,,
1618,0.97,45525.646,45547.568,"I am just curious, a trade off between the policy wanting to integrate affordable housing projects in all neighborhoods and some real estate developers choosing to pay in lieu that has a different benefit to build affordable housing.",255,,
1619,0.97,45547.568,45561.549,If we do encourage more on-site does that mean the $28 millions will go down or which would not necessarily be a bad thing if we are getting a different policy goal and building On- site.,255,,
1620,0.97,45561.549,45562.917,I think we will just submit that.,255,,
1621,0.97,45562.917,45564.652,I will submit that question for later.,255,,
1622,0.97,45564.652,45565.92,Thank you Councilmember for that question.,256,,
1623,0.97,45565.92,45569.657,That is obviously something that we continue to track.,256,,
1624,0.97,45569.657,45586.107,I actually do believe that we owe a report to Council at the end of the year or early next year that begins to summarize questions of what the existing balance is looking like as it relates to payment and performance.,256,,
1625,0.97,45586.107,45600.988,One of the things that I can say more Anecdotally is seeing an increased number of projects obviously as we move towards and have implemented a mandatory program.,256,,
1626,0.97,45600.988,45612.133,"Given the Economics in the market right now, we are seeing an increasing number of projects choosing or indicating that they intend to use performance.",256,,
1627,0.97,45612.133,45626.514,Right now we have not seen that have any significant impact on this estimated amount that we have used for the purposes of budgeting.,256,,
1628,0.97,45626.514,45635.356,"Especially because it can be one large project for example, with a larger payment that can make a real difference on how many we are able to invest as part of our Nova.",256,,
1629,0.97,45635.356,45635.723,Great question.,256,,
1630,0.97,45635.723,45643.597,We will track that and include that information in our next report to you.,256,,
1631,0.97,45643.597,45649.904,"Thank you Ellie, did you have something to add to that?",257,,
1632,0.97,45649.904,45651.005,Yes.,258,,
1633,0.97,45651.005,45651.439,Thank you.,258,,
1634,0.97,45651.439,45653.574,I wanted to add that director Alvarado said.,258,,
1635,0.97,45653.574,45657.011,There is a regular report and we are expected to see that.,258,,
1636,0.97,45657.011,45685.873,"I will look at the numbers and looking at the historic numbers and because the way Mha was implemented at different times it is difficult to see the 50- 50 balance and whether or not we are getting their because that--the goal was about a 50- 50 Joan in other high rise zones and Mha was implemented in those areas first, we saw money coming in the door from those areas first.",258,,
1637,0.97,45685.873,45703.391,I will think we are still learning whether or not we are achieving that goal and I can follow up more with you Offline Councilmember Peterson.,258,,
1638,0.97,45703.391,45703.824,Any follow-up?,259,,
1639,0.97,45703.824,45712.366,That is a great and and look forward to working with you.,259,,
1640,0.97,45712.366,45714.702,Two quick questions director Alvarado.,259,,
1641,0.97,45714.702,45720.941,How much Nova funds do you anticipate releasing in 2021?,259,,
1642,0.97,45720.941,45731.018,Our best guess at this point is the 28 million that we budget for Mha and I Z.,260,,
1643,0.97,45731.018,45762.55,And then the big decision is likely we will also invest another year of housing levy that is 29 Million-Dollars but recognizing that by virtue of taking two years of housing levy for this year's Psh pilot we continue to accelerate by one year and each year of those expenditures and will run out one year early on the housing levy as a function of resource and meeting goals.,260,,
1644,0.97,45762.55,45771.992,I do want to say for everyone for a level of confidence on an annualized basis we are exceeding our overall goals.,260,,
1645,0.97,45771.992,45781.769,Taken together 29 million plus 28 million is the best projected Nova for 2021.,260,,
1646,0.97,45781.769,45782.036,Okay.,261,,
1647,0.97,45782.036,45783.404,"And then Councilmember Strauss, did you have a question?",261,,
1648,0.97,45783.404,45784.939,Thank you for popping in.,261,,
1649,0.97,45784.939,45785.739,Good to see you.,261,,
1650,0.97,45785.739,45791.312,I just want to make sure I didn't Miss you.,261,,
1651,0.97,45791.312,45817.872,My last question is I did not see the jump Star funding reflected on the slides and we know the jump start funding comes in to play in 2022 and this year we are dealing with the 2021 budget but in anticipation of the fact that 62% of the overall revenue and the overall revenue is 214 million that means 133 million just for affordable housing efforts.,261,,
1652,0.97,45817.872,45835.856,Can you talk about how that could potentially play in pipe line for funding that you held for toe 22 and beyond and pulling those forward to see more projects in the pipe line for operation and maintenance.,261,,
1653,0.97,45835.856,45843.864,Are you able to jump start calculations for 2022 to free up dollars for 2021?,261,,
1654,0.97,45843.864,45848.002,Thanks for that question Councilmember.,262,,
1655,0.97,45848.002,45860.781,Obviously I will take lead from Mayor Durkan on the approach to future years of expanding the 2022 jump start that you mentioned was the year in which the significant focus is on housing.,262,,
1656,0.97,45860.781,45875.896,I will say that from a Pre2022 planning perspective one of the places that I have already discussed actually where knowing the future resources come most into play is around acquisition.,262,,
1657,0.97,45875.896,45890.344,"And it is because when we make acquisition loans now, we will have a reason to throttle those loans when there is less Noable future take out financing.",262,,
1658,0.97,45890.344,45902.656,It is in that lending piece that I can imagine that planning for additional 2022 resources comes into play the most.,262,,
1659,0.97,45902.656,45928.582,"But beyond that, typically our approach to a Nova is releasing an annual Nova so we will be prepared at any point to either turn up or down that dial as we do in typical years and we will always work with our incredible partners in the community to provide capacity and Pre- development support so that projects are ready when permanent financing is.",262,,
1660,0.97,45928.582,45928.849,Okay.,263,,
1661,0.97,45928.849,45936.724,So we will potentially stay flex and as the situation evolves throughout the next year plus.,263,,
1662,0.97,45936.724,45937.124,Appreciate that.,263,,
1663,0.97,45937.124,45953.908,Not just for units but for operation and maintenance that is critical and probably with this proposal in front of us Underinvested with 6 million.,263,,
1664,0.97,45953.908,45954.108,Okay.,263,,
1665,0.97,45954.108,45955.809,I don't see additional hands.,263,,
1666,0.97,45955.809,45956.11,Remarkable.,263,,
1667,0.97,45956.11,45961.248,Finishing up on time and generous to speed through that presentation and very informative.,263,,
1668,0.97,45961.248,45975.329,"I got all of my questions answered, if we have additional questions we will share those through the appropriate channels and want to say thank you for everything you are doing about housing.",263,,
1669,0.97,45975.329,45978.399,This recovery is predicated for people having a safe place to stay housed.,263,,
