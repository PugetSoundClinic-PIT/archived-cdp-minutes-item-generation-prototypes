23,0.97,378.111,381.781,Thank you very much and good morning.,3,,
24,0.97,381.781,397.73,My excitement pales in comparison to the excitement many on this briefing are feeling after years of working on this effort so it's really exciting to hear directly from the organizations and community members pushing for these transfers and actions.,3,,
25,0.97,397.73,402.635,We have presentations on two pieces of legislation.,3,,
26,0.97,402.635,414.847,Council bill 119905 authorizing long-term lease for the old fire station to Africa town community land Trust for the creation of the cultural center.,3,,
27,0.97,414.847,428.261,And Council bill 119906 authorizing transfer of the central area senior center from the city to the organization to contribute to the services provided to the community for over 50 years.,3,,
28,0.97,428.261,438.871,These legislation came to the Council and to our body for deliberation that it was after we had begun in the budget process.,3,,
29,0.97,438.871,454.287,"So recognizing we have asked Councilmembers to put various legislation on hold during the budget, we appreciate the work done with the Council President office to make sure these organizations did not have to wait anymore.",3,,
30,0.97,454.287,476.275,There has been a long process many years of their efforts trying to make sure legislation would move forward so today is a briefing instead of in one of the Finance and housing committees to make sure we are moving forward as fast as possible and not adding to the weight experienced by many community partners and organizations today.,3,,
31,0.97,476.275,495.328,We are expediting while providing this as an opportunity for the Council to deliberate and for the public to engage in the process to understand the importance of the legislation and why we are moving forward hopefully with support from the Council to enact these pieces of legislation.,3,,
32,0.97,495.328,513.446,Followed by this briefing will have a full council vote scheduled for November 2ND so I want to make sure everybody knows Timeline so if you have thoughts or feedback just like a normal committee meeting you can send those to Councilmembers and the community because we will be taking action November 2ND.,3,,
33,0.97,513.446,522.955,So we are hoping for all of you to ask questions but this is the chance for us.,3,,
34,0.97,522.955,525.758,We want to thank the Council president for working to carve out this time.,3,,
35,0.97,525.758,536.335,We know time is limited but as we are hearing more about the legislation you will see how this ties into the legislation that has already been passed.,3,,
36,0.97,536.335,555.054,Last month we passed legislation transferring property to the organization and these transfers allow for organizations to have the ability to move forward and direct control over what happens on those properties.,3,,
37,0.97,555.054,570.336,"So this transfer allowed for the sites that had been occupying the community area to be able, many decades to be able to continue the process of transferring the site to the community organization and I had been going on since the Nicholson administration.",3,,
38,0.97,570.336,586.319,In 2018 the council passed a resolution to ensure the transfer of these properties that have mutual and offsetting benefits to lease them to the organizations residing on the facilities no later than March 2019.,3,,
39,0.97,586.319,598.431,"Here we are October 2020, a long process and I'm excited to hear about the sites, the mechanisms of transfer and making sure the organizations have the support they need to move forward with their plans.",3,,
40,0.97,598.431,620.753,"Lastly I noted on 119905 the long-term lease of the old fire station six, we are excited to have Africa town floors financial and please come again in addition to equitable development initiative and the office of planning and development representatives.",3,,
41,0.97,620.753,639.572,And on Council bill 119906 the transfer of the cultural area senior center we will hear from the Presenters from the central area senior center and again we have the Department representatives and with that really excited to hear from Community partners.,3,,
42,0.97,639.572,643.175,Remember folks November 2ND is the final vote.,3,,

47,0.97,657.99,667.767,However we did get started a little late as we were running through technology and making sure we were able to receive the presentation.,4,,
48,0.97,667.767,677.71,So we are going to go ahead and run through these presentations until at least 10:30 in the morning.,4,,
49,0.97,677.71,684.817,My hope is we will get through all of them by then so we can do the last item on our agenda this morning.,4,,
50,0.97,684.817,710.71,"I'm going to go ahead and I understand you're making initial remarks . I will go ahead and handed over to you and then really quickly, either Councilmember Mosqueda or others can you provide the viewing audience and our guests a run of show in terms of which will you want to go first.",4,,
51,0.97,710.71,727.293,If it pleases the President I would love to have Council bill 119905 which is the Africa town transfer first and then Council bill 119906 the central area senior center second.,5,,
52,0.97,727.293,734.433,"Grade, we will go ahead and do the order.",6,,
53,0.97,734.433,743.876,Okay handing it over please introduce yourself for the record and make your remarks and then you can handed over to the good folks who are with us related to Council bill 119905.,6,,

55,0.97,747.179,750.483,Thank you and I will be very brief.,7,,
56,0.97,750.483,786.619,"There people spending more time on these projects than I have but just to state the boring stuff, council bill 119905 is a 99 year lease under a mutually offsetting benefits agreement with Africa town so it would provide Africa town with a landmark fire station structure that is at--in the central area of 99 years.",7,,
57,0.97,786.619,795.327,In the programming that Africa town will provide will offset the rent that would normally be charged for that facility.,7,,
58,0.97,795.327,817.249,"The central area senior center project, the Casc has been operating under mutually offsetting agreement for decades now and that legislation would transfer the property to the senior center so that they would own the property outright.",7,,
59,0.97,817.249,831.931,"So there's a difference between the projects they are in different stages, one has been active for a long time and the other is a new project, a new idea the city is hoping to get off the ground with this legislation.",7,,
60,0.97,831.931,837.536,So I will transfer over to the director to talk more about the legislation.,7,,
61,0.97,837.536,843.475,"Thank you, good morning Councilmembers.",8,,
62,0.97,843.475,856.488,"Director of Department and neighborhoods, having us on behalf of the Mayor on these important actions I will also be brief as we want to get over to the community portion of the conversation.",8,,

66,0.97,891.223,899.498,Staff are in ongoing conversations with the South Park neighborhood center as well as we know there are additional mutual and offsetting benefits throughout the city.,8,,
67,0.97,899.498,922.922,"My colleagues will give a more detailed explanation of the transfer documents and agreements but to offer a few comments we know and the community has told us when we put wealth assets and capacity in the hands of communities communities can grow, organizations can become sustainable and we as a city can fight displacement.",8,,
68,0.97,922.922,934.867,"We feel we have taken concrete steps to do that, this protects and establishes historic and Long-Standing services for seniors in the broader community.",8,,
69,0.97,934.867,945.778,It really establishes new programming that is innovative within the central district so with that I will turn it over to colleagues from OPC.,8,,
70,0.97,945.778,950.482,Thank you and good morning everyone.,9,,
71,0.97,950.482,993.225,"The initiative and division manager and I want to echo the excitement everybody has stated around transferring property to communities to build community wealth and the fire station six has been one of these, specifically the initial demonstrated project which meets through the equity drivers in economic and mobility, building economic mobility and preventing displacement commercial cultural and residential displacement and finally building on cultural assets of those communities.",9,,

80,0.97,1107.539,1120.519,Formed in 2016 following a historic inclusive development agreement between the central area community members and private owners and developers of the Midtown center.,10,,
81,0.97,1120.519,1137.169,The agreement culminated from the work of the human Union Street station business Association and Africa town Stakeholders to facilitate inclusive heritage rich development at the Midtown center including community and small business spaces and affordable housing.,10,,
82,0.97,1137.169,1139.671,I'm sure many of you are familiar with the site.,10,,

84,0.97,1167.9,1191.823,"The center was an early pioneer in Seattle and successful African-American entrepreneur, after helping slaves escape and establish a settlement he arrived as one of the first few hundred people in what is now the city of Seattle.",10,,

99,0.97,1314.346,1334.966,Just for the record it will be myself and I will be followed by--will not be able to join us today due to his scheduling conflict.,12,,
100,0.97,1360.792,1366.698,Okay are you able to see?,12,,
101,0.97,1366.698,1370.602,"Yeah, it looks good.",13,,
102,0.97,1370.602,1387.185,"Yes, the vision and opportunity to Repurpose the former fire station six as the William Grose center for cultural innovation.",14,,
103,0.97,1387.185,1406.371,"You heard about William Grose, he purchased 12 acres of land in 1822 and began to partition his land off to other blacks that were settling here which is what effectively established the central district as an African-American in the community.",14,,
104,0.97,1410.776,1449.181,"He was followed by many other pioneers or African-Americans coming from the South, mostly fleeing the Jim Crow post slavery sharecropper society, seeking better quality of life, safety, economic opportunities and this great migration we know of happened at the highest level around World War II when many people came for the shipyard, Boeing or time economy jobs.",14,,
105,0.97,1449.181,1474.206,"So when they came again, the central district in Seattle had a different type of Jim Crow racism in the form of housing restrictions where people could live and buy so blacks were settled in the central district alongside other communities, despite those conditions are very rich community group.",14,,
106,0.97,1474.206,1476.208,"Creators, makers, innovators and entrepreneurs.",14,,
107,0.97,1476.208,1514.312,"We know the legacy, the jazz legacy in the central district from Jackson street to Madison Street giving us folks or legends should we say like Quincy Jones, Ray Charles, Jimi Hendrix, creative's like war known artists and folks like Octavian Butler and continuing legacies like Ishmael Butler.",14,,
108,0.97,1518.717,1519.851,Seattle has grown.,14,,
109,0.97,1519.851,1534.332,"We look around and receive many cranes, everywhere we will see many Statistics such as those outlined here, around it being a robust and thriving economy.",14,,
110,0.97,1534.332,1543.675,Unfortunately we have not seen our community that has been here almost 140 years benefiting and growing at the same rate.,14,,
111,0.97,1543.675,1556.988,"When we look at Seattle 2035 plan we actually did not see our community, the legacy of those that were Forementioned.",14,,
112,0.97,1556.988,1563.561,"My children, the children of my peers as part of this future.",14,,
113,0.97,1563.561,1617.148,"We have seen the trends and Statistics which illustrate what we have in Seattle currently is a state of Modern- day Jim Crow apartheid . When we look at apartheid the root word being a part in the community being systematically, over time through various policies and practices being kept apart from your we can see the immediate income gap almost or more than double . We look at the wealth gap, almost half $1 million in difference.",14,,
114,0.97,1617.148,1631.63,"But again, a lot of this is due to the lack of participation in the economic growth, the various industry sectors that have driven the growth over the last 30 to 40 years.",14,,
115,0.97,1631.63,1643.241,So some of the key problems that we see is the education that community have received and we have not been preparing you for these industry sectors or Entrepreneurship.,14,,
116,0.97,1643.241,1655.887,To-Date they lack the knowledge and capital to grow in scale.,14,,
117,0.97,1655.887,1686.418,"There is very's employment for community members who have been victims of Criminalization, those policies with mass Incarceration, we see that 40% of jobs have been reported to be replaced by automation and the McKinsey study shows that would hit the black male the hardest we know immigrant refugee communities have barriers to the job market as well as growing businesses beyond communities.",14,,
118,0.97,1686.418,1704.135,The current solutions have been fragmented and inconsistent over time and Covid-19 has disproportionately impacted our community to only further exacerbate the existing gaps that existed prior.,14,,
119,0.97,1704.135,1730.128,"When we talk about the startup initiative, we understand many Tech startups, the large established businesses such as Microsoft and Amazon and then the many Spinoffs from those businesses, our community has not participated in the economy.",14,,
120,0.97,1730.128,1752.75,"1% of funding going to black Founders, even less, 2% reportedly going to black women founders and according to various studies, black net worth and wealth is predicted to go to zero.",14,,
121,0.97,1752.75,1766.097,If there is not course correction and significant direction disruption of the current status quo and again Covid-19 only exacerbates these issues.,14,,
122,0.97,1766.097,1772.57,"So, over time through various initiatives, this project is eight years in development.",14,,
123,0.97,1772.57,1787.719,We have engaged with the community and have used initiatives like back in 2014 starting the black Seattle imagine Africa town community planning initiative that is ongoing.,14,,
124,0.97,1787.719,1800.732,Black DOT which was launched as a pilot pop up Co-Working in Incubator space in 2015 and is still providing services and resources to the community.,14,,
125,0.97,1800.732,1823.755,"The 23rd action plan, the revitalization plan and process for the historical central arts and cultural District have all provided insights into what solutions we need when validating those thoughts and proposals when envisioning the William Grose.",14,,
126,0.97,1823.755,1825.423,So that brings us to this opportunity.,14,,
127,0.97,1825.423,1864.796,Imagine a team of two 12-Year- old Cofounders using a sewing machine and a 3-D printer to design a Hoodie laced with Wearable technology or high school senior stopping by the William Grose to get assistance to create an App . These are the types of opportunities we envision at the William Grose center . bigger than just the center we look at this as a catalyst and epicenter which will provide for stewardship for transforming our community through cultural innovation.,14,,
128,0.97,1864.796,1877.308,"So in the District we know we don't want to be just museum pieces or Murals, statues and plaques in a historic district.",14,,
129,0.97,1877.308,1892.991,We understand that innovation districts such as South Lake Union and University of Washington are looked at as being essential to the economy in moving the economy forward.,14,,
130,0.97,1892.991,1905.637,"So we look at how do we connect the genius and the brilliance that has been in the community, the spirit of innovation which is making a way out of no way.",14,,
131,0.97,1905.637,1927.325,Working with what you have often less is what our community has been forced out of and many time and time again have created tremendous value which has benefited many outside the community but not our community as much when we speak to driving Pop-Culture we think about the music.,14,,
132,0.97,1927.325,1988.619,From jazz to rhythm and blues to Hip-Hop to electronic and all those different aspects so we look at Africa town as an asset based community development initiative and fire station six is a place of convening and Stewarding a larger Ecosystem that we will provide for pathways from Pre- cake all the way through workforce Entrepreneurship and back to mentor and and actually investing back into the community and again making sure there is a connected Ecosystem that our young people can actually matriculate through and that those resources are present each step of the journey so they can get to the destination of economic Sustainability as individuals and then more so as a community collectively.,14,,
133,0.97,1988.619,1998.896,So the William Grose would be a Hub for innovation that has been and continues taking place in the central district.,14,,
134,0.97,1998.896,2042.94,"We look at key things, connection, points of value of culture community innovation technology and enterprise . A one-stop shop for pathways to education, employment and Entrepreneurship . A space for small businesses to Incubate and pilot business ideas and receive technical assistance needed to grow and develop and also social Enterprises and Community-Based organizations, a space for regular meetings, gatherings, networking, community, culture building around technology, enterprise and empowerment.",14,,
135,0.97,2042.94,2043.875,Who will we serve?,14,,
136,0.97,2043.875,2058.689,"You thin young adults, creative's, entrepreneurs, existing local businesses, Technologists, community builders, unemployed, underemployed, immigrants and refugees, previously incarcerated.",14,,
137,0.97,2058.689,2069.967,We think bringing people together from different walks of life and different skills provides an opportunity for greater outcomes.,14,,
138,0.97,2069.967,2079.71,You heard previously this project is in the equitable initiative demonstration project.,14,,
139,0.97,2079.71,2107.738,"We started the in 2016 and now we face significant delays in bringing this to reality so now we hope everyone can embrace the urgency particularly as we are in this, in the middle of a global pandemic that has devastated economies and even as we're doing this meeting in a much different way.",14,,
140,0.97,2107.738,2141.272,"So how do we give community, businesses and individuals really clear pathways to the future and being economically sustainable so we can have a future in the central district and in the Seattle the honors passed and helps you to become a world-class city that's inclusive of the communities of the world that have made it a city not a one class city exclusive to white, healthy, high wage primarily but that's the current trajectory we are on.",14,,
141,0.97,2141.272,2164.962,"Some of the work that has been done includes Hack-Athon, design weekends, career Integrators and career and technology incubation and really the focus over the last six months has been around Covid-19 with assistance to the business community.",14,,
142,0.97,2164.962,2190.221,"So with that I would like to let people know there is much opportunity to get involved to help make this a reality and make this a vehicle to the future for our community so that is advising strategic partners with Tech mentors, strategic partners obviously resource development and fundraising.",14,,
143,0.97,2190.221,2206.804,So with that I would like to pass it over to the state and really our face of Africa town . as many people see.,14,,
144,0.97,2206.804,2221.786,A great presentation and great history and background into why William Grose center is so important for the community.,15,,
145,0.97,2221.786,2226.958,For me I will start a little bit with my background.,15,,
146,0.97,2226.958,2235.066,I started modeling and acting when I was nine years old in Bellevue at ABC kids and teens and I had to go all the way to Bellevue.,15,,
147,0.97,2235.066,2246.277,I was a central district kid and resident . hearing the commercial on the radio spiked my interest to say that where I can go learn and train.,15,,
148,0.97,2246.277,2259.89,I ended up training as one of the only black girls in my crew in my Cohort trying to learn about how to introduce myself to the world.,15,,
149,0.97,2259.89,2260.491,As a Star.,15,,
150,0.97,2260.491,2261.892,What does that look like?,15,,
151,0.97,2261.892,2269.867,How do you embrace your own identity when you are the only one that looks like you in this space?,15,,
152,0.97,2269.867,2276.907,You're being top by a bunch of people who do not look like you or who have lived your experience.,15,,
153,0.97,2276.907,2282.413,"So hearing about William Grose center, for me I think about my journey.",15,,
154,0.97,2282.413,2302.533,"Taking that from nine years old, moving it into theater and doing about Garfield high school really Cementing my love for creative arts, finding my voice in front of the camera, behind the camera, stage managing and directing.",15,,
155,0.97,2302.533,2315.313,"Taking that experience to other places, creating a trauma troop and taking that experience to Howard University and getting right into the theater program because I was trained.",15,,
156,0.97,2315.313,2334.031,"I had the skills and they recognized right away . for me at Howard I was like I am here with all these people that look like me who have love and passion for creativity, for content creation.",15,,
157,0.97,2334.031,2342.34,"To vision something different, wanting to create a cinematic experience for the audience that doesn't exist yet.",15,,
158,0.97,2342.34,2357.788,"There I exploded, when I came back and concentrated on my studies at University of Washington Tacoma I was able to take the training into production in a serious way.",15,,
159,0.97,2357.788,2362.059,So I bring that expense with me to Africa town community land trust.,15,,
160,0.97,2362.059,2382.58,"Really Cementing so much of my love and knowledge for my community by taking my experience and producing a documentary on Gentrification, specifically in the central district, interviewing so many central district residents who experience what my family did in 2003.",15,,
161,0.97,2382.58,2393.324,Being ripped away from the place I was familiar with and bringing that knowledge to Africa town and seeing the vision at William Grose center.,15,,
162,0.97,2393.324,2405.136,"There is a direct Pathway needed in terms of a creative world for students, black students in particular that I had to carve out for myself.",15,,
163,0.97,2405.136,2409.807,There was one program I Garfield that allowed me to flourish.,15,,
164,0.97,2409.807,2416.514,"That program is not really there anymore, it's not the same.",15,,
165,0.97,2416.514,2431.929,They have taken so much money out of the arts and public institutions that the youth do not have enough avenues and pathways to find out how to explore the arts and the creative arts in a way that takes it and Infuses it with technology.,15,,
166,0.97,2431.929,2435.566,We see that now.,15,,
167,0.97,2435.566,2438.235,Right now we are on zoom.,15,,
168,0.97,2438.235,2447.378,Maybe there's a new creative way to do these meetings but there needs to be a space for someone innovative enough to be able to explore what that would look like.,15,,
169,0.97,2447.378,2460.157,And then mentor and guide it in the right direction so they can see this is how I can do that code that would change the way we communicate virtually now that we have to because of Covid.,15,,
170,0.97,2460.157,2477.875,"There is innovation that can be had and I'm looking forward to bringing in creative arts, content creation, to be production, all the things I do now with media Infusing it with the work I do with Africa town and the new coalition of King County equity now.",15,,
171,0.97,2477.875,2490.02,It is inspiring for me and I want to give inspiration to the next generation and we need to put that in place and William Grose center would be just that so thank you so much for the time.,15,,
172,0.97,2490.02,2494.425,I will pass it on to the next individual.,15,,
173,0.97,2494.425,2496.227,Thank you guys.,15,,
174,0.97,2496.227,2499.897,Thank you.,16,,
175,0.97,2499.897,2510.341,Thank you so much for speaking on those creative points on innovation and how those meat often in the community.,16,,
176,0.97,2510.341,2513.31,I have a similar experience in Seattle.,16,,
177,0.97,2513.31,2535.733,"I think at different points for me, I am a creative and the institutions that were able to prepare me to be a professional and I catered to not only my lived experience but catered to my future perspective, dreams, hopes and goals.",16,,
178,0.97,2535.733,2545.276,Institutions like Langston Hughes performing arts which had programs that were there for youth that looked like me.,16,,
179,0.97,2545.276,2550.347,Hearts and minds is another program they had.,16,,
180,0.97,2550.347,2552.383,Spaces I can go to like Odessa Brown.,16,,
181,0.97,2552.383,2587.084,"Being a Garfield high school graduate, being a Fifth- generation central district born and raised, migrate grandfather and his family created an Ecosystem so I was able to get part of that but this twenty-year change between 2000 and 2020, I recognized my younger sister who is just hitting high school has none of those opportunities to seek innovation and inspiration.",16,,
182,0.97,2587.084,2595.426,"To sharpen iron with iron, to see others who can accomplish and physically mentor her.",16,,
183,0.97,2595.426,2606.603,"Have so many mentors in this community, them themselves do not have institutions to get back the way they were able to get to me.",16,,
184,0.97,2606.603,2608.439,I am in a position to get back.,16,,
185,0.97,2608.439,2617.348,"I am a professional dancer, a licensed Cosmetologist, I got my license from somewhere not available to my community.",16,,
186,0.97,2617.348,2630.561,I have mentors that were my instructors that were constantly finding new ways to innovate and create a space for people who are like I want to do what you do so how did you get there?,16,,
187,0.97,2630.561,2632.73,There is no roadmap anymore because of devastation to the community.,16,,
188,0.97,2632.73,2649.88,"So I see myself at the William Grose center being a mentor, also continuing to be incubated in my community, being stretched in my community because I know my community has more to offer me but I know it starts where you are.",16,,
189,0.97,2649.88,2661.258,"You cannot be successful anywhere if you can't be successful on your own two feet, in your own neighborhood with people who love you and people you see every day.",16,,
190,0.97,2661.258,2667.765,If they cannot reach you and give you nurture then you cannot spread your wings in another place.,16,,
191,0.97,2667.765,2695.793,"So when we think about places like William Grose center and we look at the whole campus, I think of a community that is being revived and the fruits of that labor, the fruits of being reinvigorated will bless the whole city.",16,,
192,0.97,2695.793,2707.137,"And we have seen it by the grades that we look up to, their own innovation, tenacity and will to make it happen.",16,,
193,0.97,2707.137,2749.379,"So making it happen for the past 20 years with little to nothing and getting things taken away from us I am excited to see our city come together and say this is the need, this is a problem and we're going to address it some people like me can stay here and sustain oneself and I can offer something to the city and off Alec after moved to Los Angeles you know I have moved all over the nation to find a place because my place has been dismantled and taken from me and I am sitting here trying to stand for and bring something back so I should have to go outside my own city to get what I need?",16,,
194,0.97,2749.379,2763.894,"So I am just excited, really excited about this and I think that's all I have to say and I will pass it on to Elijah if he has anything to say to the William Grose center.",16,,
195,0.97,2763.894,2772.569,"Thank you, I love to hear your passion and your story.",17,,

201,0.97,2823.854,2852.182,"Being through that, we need to be represented, we need to be seen, we need to have mentors like myself being able to talk to the youth who are going to go through the corrupt system and going through these predatory lending's and everything else so we have a workshop where we teach basic financial principles to be able sustain ourselves and be able to get to financial wealth within the community.",17,,

203,0.97,2854.184,2865.195,I am a Africa town baby I like to say because I graduated from the Africa town graduation and really a little bit about myself.,17,,
204,0.97,2865.195,2874.171,I have been an entrepreneur since I was very young and I did not know I was an entrepreneur because I did not have anyone to cultivate myself.,17,,
205,0.97,2874.171,2881.612,From a young age at five years old I started a lemonade stand and I would do side Gigs for money.,17,,
206,0.97,2881.612,2894.625,You know I would always kind of weather was a lemonade stand or walking dogs I remember it was seen as more or less this is how I could make money.,17,,
207,0.97,2894.625,2898.929,My mom did not really tell me I was an entrepreneur or business owner.,17,,
208,0.97,2898.929,2923.453,"She just thought it was her young son doing it and I remember at eight years old I decided to grant myself a Daycare and had my own flyers and I did my own advertisements going door-to-door knocking, client relationships, building relationships with community members and a lot of people took a chance on me allowing me to walk their dogs.",17,,
209,0.97,2923.453,2933.263,"I was making a few hundred dollars a week at eight years old, being Innovated and Intubating Innovating my cultural genius myself.",17,,

211,0.97,2940.137,2942.773,You should have your own commercial.,17,,
212,0.97,2942.773,2949.146,I did not really see any of those things because I was just a kid and I was just doing what kids do.,17,,
213,0.97,2949.146,2975.605,When we find a way to get extra money and make it fun that's what we're going to do organically without the support system but what happens when we don't have the support system is we start to be told we need to be adults and adults work regular 9:00 to 5:00 and we're going to regular school districts and we don't see a space for ourselves as entrepreneurs.,17,,
214,0.97,2975.605,2992.189,"We're told to work and go to college and do these things so we are made for society so we start to forget about inner talents, inner gifts, in your love, dream and compassion and we start working regular jobs so that's what I did at 14 years old.",17,,
215,0.97,2992.189,3003.333,"I worked at the community center, a lot of those community centers in the parks and recreation.",17,,
216,0.97,3003.333,3021.351,"I did the math and I worked for about 600 hours, something crazy, $600 or something like that so I did the math and I made five dollars an hour because I was not old enough to work but I was committed to keep doing the program because this is all I had at the time.",17,,
217,0.97,3021.351,3027.858,We went through homelessness and so many different things to make money.,17,,
218,0.97,3027.858,3036.032,So I finished the program and I was happy to have that check because I worked for that and I was able to do that.,17,,
219,0.97,3036.032,3045.409,"When I got to the age when I was old enough to work I would work through the regular system and I started going to racial profiling, I started being targeted and I started fighting Micro-Aggressions.",17,,
220,0.97,3045.409,3052.549,"I did not realize the system in place to make me fail, but I knew that there was a difference.",17,,
221,0.97,3052.549,3068.899,"In the school district as 16 years old I was going to school, I was homeless and working three jobs while playing football and I was faced with all these different trials and Tribulations.",17,,
222,0.97,3068.899,3082.512,"In the workforce or in the classroom, people telling me I cannot be great and I would be a failure or going to jail and I did not have the proper mentors until later in high school.",17,,
223,0.97,3082.512,3098.328,"So really when I was able to see and find the proper mentors, got connected with my mentor and I really found out about Africa town and what it meant Úto me was seeing people who Lok like me that were successful.",17,,
224,0.97,3098.328,3105.302,"Seeing people who looked like me they were killing the game and able to give me the jewels I needed, to run the companies that I run now.",17,,
225,0.97,3105.302,3113.81,"So what that is, it's being able to not just the stable but to flourish because that's what made me do.",17,,
226,0.97,3113.81,3132.529,"So you know I was able to build these professionals coming into the community, teaching literacy skills because I want to give the skills I needed growing up and that I struggled with growing up so I can help my community and we can continue to thrive within the community.",17,,
227,0.97,3132.529,3137.367,I was raised in Seattle my whole life but I could not live in Seattle.,17,,
228,0.97,3137.367,3140.237,So I was a product of Gentrification.,17,,
229,0.97,3140.237,3157.287,"My mom could not afford to live in Seattle so we often times I went to school in every and continuously went to different schools and what that did for me, they put me on the IEP but they were not looking at my situation or hearing my story.",17,,
230,0.97,3157.287,3168.064,"There were not seeing the trials and Tribulations I was going through as a young adult and facing, those Traumas with mental health problems, going to different schools and Whatnot.",17,,
231,0.97,3168.064,3171.868,So that is what the William Grose center is.,17,,
232,0.97,3171.868,3197.294,"It is a place for kids who look like me who have energy within them and it can be cultivated within that process and I think it is very sad over $200 million is put into Incarcerating us but when we look at the funding put into cultivating inner genius and singers thrive, to see us as business owners.",17,,
233,0.97,3197.294,3204.234,I'm 20 years old I went to the high school and when I tell people I'm a business owner people look at me in disbelief.,17,,
234,0.97,3204.234,3215.045,"There shouldn't be disbelief when you look at a young black professional and see them as a business owner, you should say how can I be a part of your success?",17,,
235,0.97,3215.045,3217.847,How can I help you?,17,,
236,0.97,3217.847,3235.065,"How can I breathe life into you especially if you're saying you are supportive and want to be an ally, you have to be an ally to business owners, you have to be an ally to the William Grose center, you have to be an ally to the situations.",17,,
237,0.97,3235.065,3248.044,"So that's what I wanted to say, thank you for listening to me but definitely the William Grose center is needed.",17,,
238,0.97,3248.044,3251.748,Thank you so much.,18,,
239,0.97,3251.748,3261.291,That concludes the first presentation . We heard from every presenter on that particular panel.,18,,
240,0.97,3261.291,3287.317,"I do want to recognize we have one more presentation and, but before we transition to the second presentation I wanted to afford Councilmembers an opportunity to ask questions of either the executive staff with us or of any of the community Presenters who spoke to this particular bill.",18,,
241,0.97,3287.317,3292.989,Any questions or comments?,18,,
242,0.97,3292.989,3299.295,Councilmember Sawant please.,18,,
243,0.97,3299.295,3303.733,Thank you.,19,,
244,0.97,3303.733,3327.257,I am very excited as a district Council member and community member in the central district and a somebody who has marched along with black lives matter we are seeing the black community vision for the William Grose center moving forward thanks to all the community members and leaders who just spoke so eloquently about the history and what it means.,19,,
245,0.97,3327.257,3344.941,"For years, Africa town and other community members have been calling on the city of Seattle to transfer the unused fire station six for this vital community purpose and as noted this has been a long journey and I would say too long.",19,,
246,0.97,3344.941,3366.096,I want to note until earlier this year the Mayor had been stalling getting this transfer done and after a protest broke out in the community demand picked up momentum because of the protests I think we are seeing this coming to fruition.,19,,
247,0.97,3366.096,3393.723,In front of us and I just wanted to convey to everybody who spoke that it has been an honor for my office to have joined Africa town and alongside the justice for George Floyd protests demanding we have the city of Seattle finally expedite reproducing the fire station to the William Grose center.,19,,
248,0.97,3393.723,3421.351,I'm glad we have the legislation before us and what I expect will be a successful vote next Monday and I wanted to credit leadership for Africa town and all the allies including Decriminalize Seattle and the broader black lives matter movement who have been pushing for this to come about and of course we will hear about the central area senior center which is going to be an important step.,19,,
249,0.97,3421.351,3423.753,Together these are both important steps.,19,,
250,0.97,3423.753,3469.833,I want to note we need to couple these important steps with a lot more and over the weekend my office has offered a new proposal coming from Africa town for important budget amendment to have and to really Fund and affordable housing development on the site of the former Cairo center in the central district and so these are all projects in the District and this will be a rare opportunity to use a full square block in the central district to build affordable housing specifically to benefit black communities and to fight against black community displacement.,19,,
251,0.97,3469.833,3503.032,Lastly I will add that it was really a matter of pride for my office to join hundreds of community members who rallied against the sale of the site to corporate developer last year and those actions were really inspiring because one of those actions was able to disrupt the board meeting planning the sale on a rainy morning and it's because of this pressure from community activists that Africa town believes when you have an opportunity to acquire it.,19,,
252,0.97,3503.032,3510.84,I will say a few more things about that when we do the Council go around but I wanted to share that.,19,,
253,0.97,3510.84,3514.344,"Once again, congratulations to everybody.",19,,
254,0.97,3514.344,3521.05,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant for those comments.",20,,
255,0.97,3521.05,3523.853,"Okay, Councilmember Strauss.",20,,
256,0.97,3523.853,3529.359,Thank you all for presenting this morning.,21,,
257,0.97,3529.359,3549.679,"What strikes me and what I've seen before as I watch your teachings is you are creating a feedback loop within the community, you're using your community network to create a feedback loop able to expand outcomes beyond the input so I'm excited to support this transfer.",21,,
258,0.97,3549.679,3557.287,I'm sorry it's taking so long and I look forward to working with you more.,21,,
259,0.97,3557.287,3560.023,"Thank you, any other comments or questions for the first panel?",22,,
260,0.97,3560.023,3563.192,I do have one comment to add.,23,,
261,0.97,3563.192,3584.414,"I want to say thank you to the Council, council district 3 member Councilmember Sawant for being willing to push the city and the status quo to change to accommodate all of our communities.",23,,
262,0.97,3584.414,3592.588,The second thing I want to say at all the Councilmembers who have supported those initiatives.,23,,
263,0.97,3592.588,3611.04,It's hard to go from one state to another state and we have really been in a Jim Crow apartheid socioeconomic state and the only way to get to a new normal with equity is having old unprecedented and disruptive interventions and investments.,23,,
264,0.97,3611.04,3629.559,"So I wanted to say that, to say our focus is around ownership and the lease component is really a median or step in between so we can access and begin providing value and resources and services in that space as soon as possible.",23,,
265,0.97,3629.559,3645.041,But we would like all the counsel Council to remain committed to the property being owned by the black community as the actual outcome as soon as possible.,23,,
266,0.97,3645.041,3681.11,We understand there's bureaucratic things and we did not want to stop that from providing critical services to the businesses in this post covert environment which we are vulnerable in with 40 to 60% of black businesses being threatened to close and then we have to also be thinking very hard and fast about Upscaling our community that has been hit based on jobs being taken away.,23,,
267,0.97,3681.11,3683.78,Thank you for those closing remarks.,24,,
268,0.97,3683.78,3688.017,We do want to appreciate all of the time you have given.,24,,
269,0.97,3688.017,3731.561,Not just this morning but throughout the decades and history in the city of Seattle of continuing to champion these important issues and more importantly to fight for the solutions that we know are at our fingertips in order to make a meaningful difference in creating that disruption and really shepherding forward some meaningful wealth building opportunities that are really critically important throughout the history of the city but in a Covid-19 recovery phase have become even more important.,24,,
270,0.97,3731.561,3779.275,So really appreciate hearing from all of you and thank you to those who shared your personal experiences with the Gentrification and intentional exclusion from many of the programs available to other residents in Seattle who are not black and appreciate the opportunity to work with you in partnership as we continue to look at these important policies and in making sure we are centering the black community and those who are most negatively expressing Gentrification and displacement and economic exclusion in policy decision-making and construction.,24,,
271,0.97,3779.275,3781.41,Really do appreciate all of you being with us.,24,,
272,0.97,3781.41,3789.218,You're welcome to stay for the second presentation if you would like but we're going to go ahead and transition to the second presentation.,24,,
273,0.97,3789.218,3802.198,We are running a little over time but I do think these bills are very important . I really do want to make sure we have enough time to hear the full presentation.,24,,
274,0.97,3802.198,3803.9,"Diane, you're going to go next.",24,,
275,0.97,3803.9,3807.503,I know you're getting ready to share your screen.,24,,
276,0.97,3807.503,3812.108,Comments about this bill as an introduction?,24,,
277,0.97,3812.108,3825.354,Okay there are no additional comments and then director would you like to make opening comments on behalf of the executive would you like me to hand it over?,24,,
278,0.97,3825.354,3830.226,I will make a couple comments if that's okay.,25,,
279,0.97,3830.226,3838.768,On behalf of the Mayor we bring forward this legislation to transfer the central area senior center to the community.,25,,
280,0.97,3838.768,3847.076,A long and rich history in the central district providing central programming and services to seniors particularly in the black community.,25,,
281,0.97,3847.076,3856.118,"This has been even more so during Covid-19 as we are providing hot meals with lunches, help with prescription drugs, etc.",25,,
282,0.97,3856.118,3865.394,This builds on years of services and programs providing social cohesion connection and community as well as counseling and transportation.,25,,
283,0.97,3865.394,3879.809,We would like to thank Diane and her board for thoughtful conversation for advocacy over the years and pleased to bring forward this legislation.,25,,
284,0.97,3879.809,3883.679,Thank you for the opening remarks.,26,,
285,0.97,3883.679,3885.214,Councilmember Mosqueda any additional remarks?,26,,
286,0.97,3885.214,3889.118,"Okay Diane, welcome.",26,,
287,0.97,3889.118,3892.822,I see you have a very strong backup team behind you.,26,,
288,0.97,3892.822,3909.138,In the room with you so we are excited to welcome you to the Council briefing and we are excited to hear more about the central area senior center and how this proposed bill supports the central area senior center.,26,,
289,0.97,3909.138,3911.307,Welcome.,26,,
290,0.97,3911.307,3911.941,Thank you.,27,,
291,0.97,3911.941,3931.627,"First of all we have our board President, we have with us my Cohort Dr. John Perkins who has worked hard with us over the last several years to get to this point and then we have a member with us, Carol wells.",27,,
292,0.97,3931.627,3938.734,2020 is shaping up to be an exciting opportunity for us and much is happening quickly.,27,,
293,0.97,3938.734,3967.563,"We have been at this for at least the last five years so everything is rapidly happening starting with in 2019 August 22nd it was my birth day in the city told us we had to make sure we had $55,000 in the bank as capital Enhancement funds and maintenance funds for the building and we had to make sure by September 1ST we could document that.",27,,
294,0.97,3967.563,4000.896,"So we were part of another organization who did not separate funds entirely so things were mixed and I couldn't get a clear number of how much money we had in the account so we decided to raise $55,000 and put it in the bank account and within seven days the community had supported us to such an extent we had raised over $100,000 and we knew we were on our way to where we needed to be.",27,,
295,0.97,4000.896,4005.901,It has been a long and arduous over 50 years for us.,27,,
296,0.97,4005.901,4019.148,In 1960 a number of African- American people who are public employees decided the African- American seniors needed a dedicated space where they could have programs.,27,,
297,0.97,4019.148,4033.362,"We had been in partnership with the Jewish community, Redlining where Italians and Jewish people and Japanese and African- American people were confined to a certain part of the city.",27,,
298,0.97,4033.362,4040.469,At that point in time 70% of the central district was African-American compared to 8% today.,27,,
299,0.97,4040.469,4054.083,Through the partnership the Jewish community said we are no longer using the space for the Convalescent center we would like for you to be the owners of that space so they allowed us to rent it.,27,,
300,0.97,4054.083,4072.701,"Our purpose has always been to infuse warm friendships, healthy activities, joyful experiences into the lives of mature adults which is defined as a population of 55 years or older.",27,,
301,0.97,4072.701,4092.288,One of our visions that we have and why we are so pleased for the ownership of the building is that it has been very difficult to raise the ongoing funds that are needed to make sure that we can keep the building up in top shape condition.,27,,
302,0.97,4092.288,4107.736,Needs retrofitting and a bunch of different things but we have always had a vision for ourselves and it is that we want to be recognized as the Premier nonprofit organization serving older adults within the central district and the central community.,27,,
303,0.97,4107.736,4118.647,"It has always been a place where people come together to grab a bite to eat, to learn and acquire new enhanced knowledge while Socializing and having fun.",27,,
304,0.97,4118.647,4134.13,"Having healthy ongoing activities, right now we have the drumming group meeting on the outside of the building as well as our health and wellness class, doing fitness exercise and Tai Chi.",27,,
305,0.97,4134.13,4143.472,The problems we want to address in the future when the transfer officially happens is we want to modernize the building to accommodate more people.,27,,
306,0.97,4143.472,4153.582,"We have many symptoms and systems we need to upgrade, we need to retrofit, we need a generator.",27,,
307,0.97,4153.582,4171.901,We want to enhance and improve the parking lot which we were able to acquire a permit for and we want to continue to reflect the rich historical and cultural significance that the central area senior center has played in the central district since it's a very founding.,27,,
308,0.97,4171.901,4178.207,One of the things we are very proud of is we have so many partnerships.,27,,
309,0.97,4178.207,4194.823,One of the partnerships is with an organization that every year I recommend maybe 10 seniors in need of Rehab to their homes and dwelling places and then they go out and do whatever the Rehab needs.,27,,
310,0.97,4194.823,4207.236,One particular thing that happened last year was one member was able to get her plumbing totally Redone as well as a that had been written deteriorating.,27,,
311,0.97,4207.236,4210.706,So they came out and replaced the Tech.,27,,
312,0.97,4210.706,4220.583,"Our members are happy, as we experience Covid-19 the biggest thing we are hearing is they all want to come back as soon as possible.",27,,
313,0.97,4220.583,4225.454,Social isolation is great but they miss the center.,27,,
314,0.97,4225.454,4239.368,"Ongoing activities include live music every third Friday, the birthday lunch is people Miss where they get flowers and they are honored for having aged another year.",27,,
315,0.97,4239.368,4248.477,"It's always a competition, some are as old as 107 and everybody always wants to be the oldest person in the room.",27,,
316,0.97,4248.477,4254.984,We have a patio party everybody missed that this year that is a big thing.,27,,
317,0.97,4254.984,4260.289,"We open up the terrace, you can watch the Hydroplane racing.",27,,
318,0.97,4260.289,4265.561,We have great food and dancing and live music.,27,,
319,0.97,4265.561,4272.868,You can even get a couple Cocktails if you want but that's the kind of spirit that happens at the central area senior center.,27,,
320,0.97,4272.868,4294.823,So the long-term purpose and vision since our founding in 1960 has been to celebrate and serve all seniors especially those of African-American and of African immigrant backgrounds that live in King county in addition to serving the whole entire central district.,27,,
321,0.97,4294.823,4319.348,"We are seen as both a senior center and as a community center in many ways for all the various community councils that meet here, people that come here to celebrate a life and just to have a great time as well as making sure they are all healthy and well.",27,,
322,0.97,4319.348,4322.284,We would like to thank everyone that has helped in this journey.,27,,
323,0.97,4322.284,4346.575,"We particularly appreciate Councilmembers O'Brien and in 2018 they were willing to take the case to the Seattle city Council and the Councilmember Councilmember Sawant, Councilmember Mosqueda and Councilmember Moraels were instrumental in moving forward in 2019 and 2020 to get us to the place we are.",27,,
324,0.97,4346.575,4352.681,And we thank the inner departmental team that we met with.,27,,
325,0.97,4352.681,4377.272,We have to say that the office of economic development and all of their staff that worked with them took us through the Ringer but it was a good journey to take together because we have arrived at the point that has been our vision for the last 51 years so we thank you.,27,,
326,0.97,4377.272,4380.743,Now we are ready.,27,,
327,0.97,4382.845,4385.614,Great.,28,,
328,0.97,4385.614,4390.085,Okay thank you so much Diane for the presentation.,28,,
329,0.97,4390.085,4392.02,Really appreciate it.,28,,
330,0.97,4392.02,4402.03,"Colleagues, any questions or comments? certainly want to make sure the director has an opportunity to add additional information as well.",28,,
331,0.97,4402.03,4406.935,I see Councilmember Mosqueda in the Queue first.,28,,
332,0.97,4406.935,4409.338,I just want to say thank you for all the work.,29,,
333,0.97,4409.338,4418.113,It's wonderful to hear you today and to see all the work you have been putting into this finally coming to fruition ideally with a vote next week.,29,,
334,0.97,4418.113,4447.743,"When we had the chance to meet in the community, it was the same week you had just found out the parameters were sort of moving and there was a six page document like we had to meet these criteria and you have all been doing heroes work to pull together not just funding but responding to moving Goalposts I want to say how much work I appreciate that you do and in addition to getting this back end administrative work complete so this transfer can go forward.",29,,
335,0.97,4447.743,4456.685,It is really a portable and I don't want that to go unsaid.,29,,
336,0.97,4456.685,4479.208,"Have done a tremendous amount of work and the scenes to respond to changing criteria and Kudos to you and the entire community for all the hard work you have done to pull together the funding but especially now when we know senior isolation for example is tremendously high and adding to the stress that Covid is already imposing on communities, especially black and Brown communities.",29,,
337,0.97,4479.208,4488.183,You're actually saving lives so whatever we can do to help you please count us in for the future as well.,29,,
338,0.97,4488.183,4488.584,Thank you.,29,,
339,0.97,4488.584,4490.219,Just the beginning of another chapter.,29,,
340,0.97,4490.219,4491.787,Inc.,30,,
341,0.97,4491.787,4494.289,Is so much Councilmember Mosqueda for the comments.,30,,
342,0.97,4494.289,4498.293,I have Councilmember Sawant and then Councilmember Pedersen.,30,,
343,0.97,4498.293,4518.847,"Thank you Diane for the presentation and for your long- standing advocacy for this issue for this to be brought into community ownership but also, all the service you provide to the community as a whole in the central district but especially the senior group.",31,,
344,0.97,4518.847,4535.33,For whom I know it is not at all an exaggeration to say that the central area senior center is a community lifeline for the seniors not just in the central district but in the wider region.,31,,
345,0.97,4535.33,4543.438,I wanted to share one example that I will never forget this.,31,,
346,0.97,4543.438,4562.691,"On April 23rd of last year, of course Diane and others will remember we were all there together with the leadership with many from the central district including nearly 100 seniors at City Hall.",31,,
347,0.97,4562.691,4585.914,"We gathered at a rally at City Hall lobby then we went to the chambers to do the committee which is being shared by my office where we discussed resolution and that was one step in order to notch the process along and was really inspiring to hear 100 seniors chanting no more delays, no more delays.",31,,
348,0.97,4585.914,4596.391,We need this to go forward but the example I wanted to share and Unfortunately I don't remember the name of the community member but I know Diane will know who I'm talking about.,31,,
349,0.97,4596.391,4607.202,"This wonderful woman who said you know she faced, she had a brain aneurysm which resulted in blindness.",31,,
350,0.97,4607.202,4639.267,"You can just imagine the kind of trauma one would go through especially being a senior and extreme and sudden Onset of isolation . She was describing how she literally needed to learn how to walk again because suddenly she was without site and how the center services and not just the services but community, love, encouragement she got she Relearned to walk and she learned how to dance.",31,,
351,0.97,4639.267,4649.878,It was Transformative for her life and really possibly helped her live as opposed to some other extremely tragic outcome.,31,,
352,0.97,4649.878,4662.057,"So I think that story is a real example of how it is so precious, what we have here and it's really important this legislation is finally moving forward.",31,,
353,0.97,4662.057,4664.126,It is an integral part of the community.,31,,
354,0.97,4664.126,4666.495,That was Kelsey Watson.,32,,
355,0.97,4666.495,4670.399,She will be happy and thrilled you remembered that.,32,,
356,0.97,4670.399,4673.168,She continues to dance today.,32,,
357,0.97,4673.168,4678.106,Thank you Councilmember Sawant for those comments and for reminding us of those moments.,33,,
358,0.97,4678.106,4682.177,Councilmember Pedersen.,33,,
359,0.97,4682.177,4686.415,Thank you Diane for being here and with your crew today.,34,,
360,0.97,4686.415,4729.658,"I have spent a lot of time at the central community meetings over the years and it is such a wonderful asset for the community and I am glad we are seeing the Council and the Mayor's administration trying to address displacement issues and prevent more Gentrification and preserve assets in the community and I think this question, I appreciate Councilmember Mosqueda having this briefing so we can look at the real estate documents before us and try to better understand or get them out to the public so that we can hurry up and get this done finally.",34,,
361,0.97,4729.658,4739.234,"So I guess, this question is on the city council central staff if still here.",34,,
362,0.97,4739.234,4742.27,He is still here.,35,,
363,0.97,4742.27,4743.171,Okay good.,36,,
364,0.97,4743.171,4748.376,Two questions on the real estate documents that were attached.,36,,
365,0.97,4748.376,4763.191,"There was something called form of deed and the form of deed I just want to understand, it looks like there is an opportunity in the future perhaps for affordable housing.",36,,
366,0.97,4763.191,4770.298,Wanted to understand how is affordable housing defined for this particular deal?,36,,
367,0.97,4770.298,4788.917,"My understanding is the central area senior center does not intend to build housing on their site but if they did want to, it's 80% or below median Ncome under the deed.",37,,
368,0.97,4788.917,4796.525,I think half of the units would have to be below 60% varied median income.,37,,
369,0.97,4796.525,4805.033,But if I get that wrong or if I'm incorrect please correct me.,37,,
370,0.97,4805.033,4814.409,Okay it is defined as 80% of area median income but half of the units have to be at least 60% of area median income.,38,,
371,0.97,4814.409,4817.345,Okay thank you.,38,,
372,0.97,4817.345,4818.613,"Below, thank you.",38,,
373,0.97,4818.613,4842.237,"And then, there is a paragraph in the deed at the bottom, number five . So, P 5 which says the nonprofit organization is authorized to sell the property only if all the following conditions are satisfied.",38,,
374,0.97,4842.237,4850.979,Obviously we want to keep the central and public hands and providing these great services that it provides.,38,,
375,0.97,4850.979,4860.689,Could you explain the purpose of that clause where it says the nonprofit organization is authorized to sell the property.,38,,
376,0.97,4860.689,4865.393,The city is transferring ownership of the property to central area senior center.,39,,
377,0.97,4865.393,4880.208,It is a nonprofit organization that fulfills a certain mission and the goal of the legislation is to enable them to continue serving that mission.,39,,
378,0.97,4880.208,4885.714,It is variable very viable property.,39,,
379,0.97,4885.714,4889.117,"As you know, having been there it has amazing views.",39,,
380,0.97,4889.117,4897.692,It is a large site with a relatively small building on the site.,39,,
381,0.97,4897.692,4904.132,It may make sense in the future for the organization to sell the property and move their operations to a different location.,39,,
382,0.97,4904.132,4931.126,"If that come over time, becomes in their interest and I know it's not the intent now in the near or long term but if it does become in the interest in the deed would require that there be, that the mission of the legislation in the city transfer of property to the senior center is fulfilled.",39,,
383,0.97,4931.126,4936.865,Can I join in and say something?,40,,
384,0.97,4936.865,4939.868,"Absolutely, please Diane.",41,,
