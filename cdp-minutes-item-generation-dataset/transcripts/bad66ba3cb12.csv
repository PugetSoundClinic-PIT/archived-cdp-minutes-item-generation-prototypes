29,0.97,120.954,121.921,Thank you.,21,,
30,0.97,121.921,155.788,With sadness I bring this proclamation forward to honor Scott morrow who tragically passed away . I wanted to convey the deepest condolences for myself and everyone in my office and everyone in my organization and everyone who is among the loved ones and all of the activists and others in Seattle who worked with Scott.,21,,
31,0.97,155.788,156.823,This is a tremendous loss.,21,,
32,0.97,156.823,160.36,Scott dedicated most of his adult life to helping homeless people in Seattle.,21,,
33,0.97,160.36,164.564,He organized to fight for shelter and housing in their community.,21,,
34,0.97,164.564,197.497,He was a courageous and tireless activist who never sold out his community or compromised his principal . on that know I can attest that it is such an unusual and extraordinary thing to find that kind of unshakable activists.,21,,
35,0.97,197.497,205.138,"Scott organized with Washington helping Renters fight for building repairs, stop rent increases, preserved buildings, and replace demolished housing units.",21,,
36,0.97,205.138,218.451,"In 1988 he put himself on the line and was arrested while participating in nonviolent civil disobedience in the occupation of the Gatewood hotel, which the property owner had left vacant in violation of city law.",21,,
37,0.97,218.451,227.06,They compel the property owner to give tenant housing a 25 year lease to operate the building for low income housing.,21,,
38,0.97,227.06,239.072,At that time he also joined Renters protesting the Washington state center planned demolition of the Mccabe building.,21,,
39,0.97,239.072,246.746,And two brief occupations resulted in a settlement amounting to millions of dollars for affordable housing.,21,,
40,0.97,246.746,260.293,"Seeing the impact of rising rent on homelessness in 1989, Scott morrow began handing out coffee to homeless neighbors in Seattle and discussed with them how to fight for shelter and housing.",21,,
41,0.97,260.293,263.429,He continued to doing so each morning until his diagnosis with cancer in 2021.,21,,
42,0.97,263.429,281.948,"In 1990 Seattle hosted the goodwill games and while handing out coffee Scott started to hear more and more fear from homeless neighbors and Pioneer square, who were in danger of being swept as the city attempted to hide signs of poverty from the Toursts.",21,,
43,0.97,281.948,284.784,Scott helped these people get organized.,21,,
44,0.97,284.784,302.835,They organized a goodwill gathering in the park as a safe place . This group of homeless neighbors saw the impact of organizing and became the founding organizers of the Seattle housing and resource effort.,21,,
45,0.97,302.835,310.71,Scott set up--residents were allowed to live in the lower vacant area.,21,,
46,0.97,310.71,317.55,He also started the first indoor shelter at the Catholic Church.,21,,
47,0.97,317.55,331.23,In 2000 Scott morrow reached a agreement with the city of Seattle to have--at a time in the city.,21,,
48,0.97,331.23,336.202,It is the oldest permanent homeless encampment in the United States.,21,,
49,0.97,336.202,343.343,"Share now operates 11 indoor shelters, three work for housing locations, tree storage lockers, and two tent in Chemnitz.",21,,
50,0.97,343.343,366.299,"Eight years later, in 2008, Scott helped---- Unsanctioned self governed encampment on city-owned land on September 22nd, 2008.",21,,
51,0.97,366.299,374.474,Five days later they swept the encampment arresting several dozen people.,21,,
52,0.97,374.474,385.384,They immediately established their and came in on State- owned land and they continue to operate those in Chemnitz and tiny villages ever since.,21,,
53,0.97,385.384,393.292,"It has been an honor to work with Scott morrow and all of the activists in Nicholasville, including Peggy herself.",21,,
54,0.97,393.292,400.767,"And basically every progressive struggle in Seattle, since I first took office.",21,,
55,0.97,400.767,411.477,We worked together for permitting procedures and the first ever city funding for tiny House villages.,21,,
56,0.97,411.477,439.372,"Scott was an integral part of the tax handling on movement from the very beginning in 2017 when we were doing the people's budget movement . When we did the peaceful occupation of city hall where activists of Nicholasville were prominent among those who were fighting for the Amazon tax at that time, along with many union members.",21,,
57,0.97,439.372,448.014,"He was there with us when the majority Councilmembers sold us out, shamefully, and repealed the Amazon tax in 2018.",21,,
58,0.97,448.014,488.654,And he was there with us when we rebuilt the movement after my office was able to win reelection . and then we won the Amazon tax . throughout the time that I have been in city hall Scott morrow has been an activist for affordable housing and continued to mobilize and organize ordinary people and help them recognize their own strengths and coming together and fighting for something that they deeply believe in.,21,,
59,0.97,488.654,495.428,"Scott believed, himself, in the rights of homeless neighbors to self manage their own communities.",21,,
60,0.97,495.428,502.668,He was dedicated to helping his fellow activists gain political confidence.,21,,
61,0.97,502.668,506.072,He helped organize them to speak at public events and testify at Council meetings.,21,,
62,0.97,506.072,511.477,He also believed strongly in democracy.,21,,
63,0.97,511.477,515.047,We have joined many Progressive coalitions and endorsed progressive events.,21,,
64,0.97,515.047,519.318,"But only after a Democratic discussion, debate, and go of the members.",21,,
65,0.97,519.318,526.058,This is very much the spirit that is shared with all of the activists.,21,,
66,0.97,526.058,528.861,The Seattle times ran an article about his legacy.,21,,
67,0.97,528.861,535.067,"Including a quote from operation Nightwatch, Rick Reynolds.",21,,
68,0.97,535.067,544.076,He said he would never forget the summer night he was handing out ice cream at a protest camp at the county administration building and found Scott morrow sleeping on the ground.,21,,
69,0.97,544.076,547.48,I realize this guys going to get up and sell coffee at 6:00.,21,,
70,0.97,547.48,548.614,Why?,21,,
71,0.97,548.614,551.217,He believed passionately that every human being is worth the sacrifice.,21,,
72,0.97,551.217,563.596,It is not an exaggeration to say that Scott morrow's selfless and courageous organizing has touched thousands of lives.,21,,
73,0.97,563.596,564.764,Perhaps more.,21,,
74,0.97,564.764,573.906,"His death is a loss for all of us who are genuinely fighting for an affordable Seattle, that allows for every human being's dignity.",21,,
75,0.97,573.906,582.081,"There will be a celebration of life for Scott morrow on Saturday, may 14th, at 3:00 P.M.",21,,
76,0.97,582.081,590.856,In district 3. I am really grateful to Peggy and others being here on this zoom call.,21,,
77,0.97,590.856,600.967,"I wish we were all in person at City hall, in chambers, where I could bring hundreds of people that are mourning his loss.",21,,
78,0.97,600.967,616.482,"Let's make sure we share the message, not only of remembering Scott himself but remembering the legacy left behind and not abandoning our fight for an affordable and just Seattle.",21,,

97,0.97,680.78,686.452,I learned a whole lot about how to organized with heart and put the leadership of others first.,27,,
98,0.97,686.452,698.297,Scott was talking about the importance of listening to and centering the voices of those with lived experiences long before it was fashionable to do so.,27,,
99,0.97,698.297,708.641,I believe in my heart that--and more portly to the lives of individual people.,27,,

108,0.97,753.352,760.759,Meeting in the tiny House village as a matter fact.,29,,
109,0.97,760.759,768.334,I learned a lot from him about the value of Self-Governance for shelter residents.,29,,
110,0.97,768.334,777.743,I just want to remind folks that we can really honor Scott by ensuring that we provide the services that our homeless neighbors need and by building the housing that will provide the stability that our neighbors continue to need as well.,29,,

116,0.97,815.514,838.938,"I really appreciated Scott's advocacy, his partnership, and his willingness to continue to work together in a collaborative faith to get people more places to go and stay focused on making sure we have a homelessness strategy centered on getting a roof over people's heads and letting people live in the safety and dignity that a lot of us take for granted.",30,,
117,0.97,838.938,845.711,I really appreciated that partnership from Scott.,30,,
118,0.97,845.711,852.117,His partnership is going to be sorely missed.,30,,

130,0.97,905.07,909.975,"Jarvis, if you perhaps want to start by making a few comments at this time and that I can hand it over to Peggy.",32,,
131,0.97,909.975,911.043,Thank you for being here.,32,,
132,0.97,911.043,919.018,Thank you so much Councilmember Pedersen.,33,,
133,0.97,919.018,929.528,And thank you to Councilmember Sawant for Choosin this proclamation . and tall Councilmembers.,33,,
134,0.97,929.528,939.705,"I met Scott close to 15 years ago, when I first became homeless, and I stayed at density three.",33,,
135,0.97,939.705,952.051,At that point that was the only option that I had.,33,,
136,0.97,952.551,956.956,It was such an Eye-Opening event for me when I first became homeless and I didn't know what to do.,33,,
137,0.97,956.956,962.795,I had no direction in my life at the time.,33,,
138,0.97,962.795,1001.967,"Because of the self managed nature of the tent city I was able to be empowered and join the advocacy for others, as well as myself, and having a say in how I live my life . I am forever grateful for Scott morrow for empowering homeless people like myself and allowing us to speak for ourselves.",33,,
139,0.97,1001.967,1005.804,He will be missed.,33,,
140,0.97,1005.804,1022.654,"His unwavering support for, and empowering people that are facing adversity, it's really the main impact that I can say that Scott morrow has on me.",33,,
141,0.97,1022.654,1028.66,And I'm pretty sure others that have experienced it.,33,,
142,0.97,1028.66,1054.186,I would like to think the Councilmembers for this proclamation . As you can see I'm speaking to you inside my tiny house . Thank you.,33,,
143,0.97,1056.655,1059.258,"Jarvis, thank you so much and thank you for your service.",34,,

147,0.97,1062.327,1063.162,Thank you.,35,,
148,0.97,1063.162,1065.397,Thank you to Councilmember Sawant for bringing this proclamation forward.,35,,
149,0.97,1065.397,1069.535,Scott believed that homelessness is caused primarily by a lack of affordable and social housing.,35,,
150,0.97,1069.535,1082.214,"He believed that homeless people are capable of not only operating their own shelters and Encampments, he believed they should be included in all discussions about what happens in the homeless community.",35,,
151,0.97,1082.214,1091.657,He also believed that they are capable of fighting to survive and solve homelessness.,35,,
152,0.97,1091.657,1106.605,I am convinced that without Scott's dedication and his unparalleled organizing skills there certainly would not have been tiny House villages and shelters . and probably there would be fewer numbers of those things.,35,,
153,0.97,1106.605,1116.715,I support this proclamation and I think the counsel for doing so.,35,,
154,0.97,1116.715,1123.489,"Peggy, thank you so much.",36,,
155,0.97,1123.489,1126.358,"Madam clerk, do we Procedurally need to do anything else to deliver the proclamation?",36,,
156,0.97,1126.358,1133.699,At this point we do not.,37,,
157,0.97,1133.699,1136.502,"Jarvis and Peggy, thank you so much for joining us.",38,,
158,0.97,1136.502,1144.543,And thank you to Councilmember Sawant for bringing forward this proclamation to recognize Scott.,38,,
159,0.97,1144.543,1151.316,As was discussed at the beginning of the presentation Councilmember Sawant would like to be excused from the rest of the meeting.,38,,
160,0.97,1151.316,1160.259,"I will make that motion, given that Councilmember Sawant is not feeling well, to be excused from the ballot of this meeting today.",38,,
161,0.97,1160.259,1163.028,"May 3RD, 2022.",38,,
162,0.97,1163.028,1168.333,Is there any objection to Excusing Councilmember Sawant for the rest of the meeting?,38,,
163,0.97,1168.333,1170.836,I'm hearing none.,38,,
164,0.97,1170.836,1172.738,"Councilmember Sawant, you are excused.",38,,

167,0.97,1181.58,1187.753,We will now proceed to the approval of the introduction and referral calendar.,40,,
168,0.97,1187.753,1195.46,At the front of this I just wanted to make a couple of very brief comments under the President pro Tem's prerogative.,40,,
169,0.97,1195.46,1201.833,"There will probably be a contested motion, Procedurally, as part of this process.",40,,
170,0.97,1201.833,1217.382,"I would just ask colleagues, given that we did discuss this a fair amount and briefing yesterday, to keep comments for or against the procedural motions brief.",40,,
171,0.97,1217.382,1218.417,So that we can move forward.,40,,
172,0.97,1218.417,1221.119,Colleagues will be able to make their decision one way or the other.,40,,
173,0.97,1221.119,1229.328,We did have a preview of potential arguments yesterday and of course it would be appropriate for those arguments to be Re-Raised.,40,,
174,0.97,1229.328,1234.232,I would just ask that the comments be brief and we then be able to move on and vote.,40,,
175,0.97,1234.232,1248.814,I would also ask that members make sure that per our Council rules the motives of particular Councilmembers are Impugned as we proceed this procedural motion.,40,,
176,0.97,1248.814,1250.816,I know everyone will follow those rules.,40,,
177,0.97,1250.816,1256.121,And people should please direct their comments to--rather than other counsel colleagues.,40,,
178,0.97,1256.121,1262.26,With that I move to adopt the introduction and referral calendar.,40,,
179,0.97,1262.26,1266.765,Is there a second?,40,,
180,0.97,1266.765,1267.165,Thank you.,40,,
181,0.97,1267.165,1271.703,It's been moved and Seconded to adopt the introduction and referral calendar.,40,,
182,0.97,1271.703,1277.676,Are there any motions to amend the calendar?,40,,
183,0.97,1277.676,1278.71,Councilmember Herbold?,40,,
184,0.97,1278.71,1280.078,Thank you.,41,,
185,0.97,1280.078,1297.863,"I move the calendar to include a bill related to appropriations for the Seattle police Department proposed by 12 6490, which ADOPTS the 2022 budget.",41,,
186,0.97,1297.863,1302.768,And referring into the public self the committee.,41,,
187,0.97,1302.768,1304.369,Thank you for that motion.,42,,
188,0.97,1304.369,1307.105,Is there a second for Councilmember Herbold's amendment?,42,,
189,0.97,1307.105,1308.407,Second.,43,,
190,0.97,1308.407,1312.744,Thank you.,44,,
191,0.97,1312.744,1314.079,Are there any comments?,44,,
192,0.97,1314.079,1324.189,I would allow for Councilmember Herbold to make comments first and then I will accept comments from other Councilmembers on the amendment on the floor.,44,,
193,0.97,1324.189,1324.69,Councilmember Herbold?,44,,
194,0.97,1324.69,1325.624,Thank you so much.,45,,
195,0.97,1325.624,1337.302,"As mentioned yesterday morning, yesterday afternoon rather, the committee faces an unusual mismatch between the timing of full counsel and the meeting of the committee itself.",45,,
196,0.97,1337.302,1345.877,The introduction and referral calendar is voted on at the Tuesday afternoon full council meeting and the committee meeting in the morning on Tuesday.,45,,
197,0.97,1345.877,1353.719,There is a One-Week delay between introduction and referral and Committee consideration.,45,,
198,0.97,1353.719,1361.96,Other committees that me on Wednesday or Thursday can actually consider legislation referred on Tuesday's meeting.,45,,
199,0.97,1361.96,1383.315,"As background I just wanted to state for the record that I supported, when asked by Council President, I supported Councilmember Nelson's committee and supported a vote on it . just as Councilmember Nelson has requested.",45,,
200,0.97,1383.315,1386.384,I would like a vote on both bills in the committee meeting since they are related.,45,,
201,0.97,1386.384,1388.62,And from some perspective they are complement three.,45,,
202,0.97,1388.62,1395.527,Moving full council meetings on Tuesday has created a logistical disadvantage for timely consideration of legislation.,45,,
203,0.97,1395.527,1406.138,"Meetings on Tuesday morning, walking on legislation is a normal feature of counsel operations and is then done numerous times over the years.",45,,
204,0.97,1406.138,1430.061,"This is done by simply amending--and the rules themselves state under section 3A, subsection 1E, when adoption of the introduction referral calendar is being considered during each council meeting it may be modified by a majority rule, a majority vote of Council members present.",45,,
205,0.97,1430.061,1440.806,I want to underscore that I don't believe that applying our Council rules as written is in any way a Circumvention of those rules.,45,,
206,0.97,1440.806,1442.774,Thank you.,45,,
207,0.97,1442.774,1445.811,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,46,,
208,0.97,1445.811,1448.38,Are there any other comments on the amendment for the counsel?,46,,
209,0.97,1448.38,1454.553,Councilmember Nelson?,46,,
210,0.97,1454.553,1455.387,Thank you very much.,47,,
211,0.97,1455.387,1461.259,I'm glad that my resolution has Councilmember Herbold of the urgency of this issue.,47,,
212,0.97,1461.259,1468.467,By rushing the proposal onto the introduction and referral calendar today is profamily disrespect will.,47,,
213,0.97,1468.467,1477.108,Not only of our Council president but also the rules and priorities are agreed-upon norms that govern the legislative process.,47,,
214,0.97,1477.108,1482.247,You all know that for the benefit of our public our legislative intake and review calendars are three weeks long.,47,,
215,0.97,1482.247,1490.789,From the time it gets on the Pre-Introduction calendar to formal introduction in the committee referral.,47,,
216,0.97,1490.789,1493.391,That is what is being voted on today and every Tuesday.,47,,
217,0.97,1493.391,1504.469,"This time frame allows the necessary time for the Council President to review legislation, decide what committee to refer to, and to try to broker, compromise, and collaborate.",47,,
218,0.97,1504.469,1506.371,Which I am totally open to.,47,,
219,0.97,1506.371,1516.581,It also provides the time for the public to see legislation on the adopted IRC before the committee.,47,,
220,0.97,1516.581,1517.749,This provides thoughtful deliberation and transparency.,47,,
221,0.97,1517.749,1530.495,For some reason Councilmember Herbold asked Council President Juarez to expedite our introduction process . But she refused.,47,,
222,0.97,1530.495,1531.396,Council President Juarez refused.,47,,
223,0.97,1531.396,1533.632,Knowing that my resolution was up for Info on the 10th.,47,,
224,0.97,1533.632,1541.573,And also knowing that I have a competing counsel bill that Councilmember Herbold refused to let me address the last community meeting.,47,,
225,0.97,1541.573,1546.511,We unanimous me elected Council President Juarez.,47,,
226,0.97,1546.511,1559.891,Councilmember Herbold is attempting to go around her authority by trying to walk this on a week early only so that we can voted out of the public safety Committee on May 10th.,47,,
227,0.97,1559.891,1562.36,And that agenda will already be packed with my resolution.,47,,
228,0.97,1562.36,1572.404,"Now Councilmember Herbold wants to add yet another complex item to the agenda and vote it out on the same day, knowing full well that there will be rigorous debate.",47,,
229,0.97,1572.404,1574.005,I do have a solution.,47,,
230,0.97,1574.005,1579.477,One solution could be that we discuss it on the 10th.,47,,
231,0.97,1579.477,1583.481,And then voted out the following committee meeting once it's on the referral calendar.,47,,
232,0.97,1583.481,1594.593,I have allowed time on two committees for discussion and vote on the surveillance impact reports.,47,,
233,0.97,1594.593,1596.061,And that's not even the issue.,47,,
234,0.97,1596.061,1600.131,I did that because it's controversial.,47,,
235,0.97,1600.131,1607.539,"Two meetings allows for public engagement, debate, and amendments.",47,,
236,0.97,1607.539,1609.574,We walk on legislation when it's really time sensitive.,47,,
237,0.97,1609.574,1613.712,Like when we are about to be sued or we stand to lose money if we don't take action.,47,,
238,0.97,1613.712,1621.486,Walking on Councilmember Herbold's bill this time does not meet that level of urgency in my opinion.,47,,
239,0.97,1621.486,1625.357,It really doesn't make any sense to me.,47,,
240,0.97,1625.357,1636.434,Jamming legislation through the Egislative process Degrades our function as a Deliberative body and creates bad policy.,47,,
241,0.97,1636.434,1645.21,One could argue that some of the things we see around our city right now are the unintended consequences from rushing and not taking the time to be really careful.,47,,
242,0.97,1645.21,1655.487,Councilmember Herbold spent months delaying action on this issue while waiting for the Mayor's memo on citywide hiring incentives.,47,,
243,0.97,1655.487,1662.927,Now that I've brought forward the Seattle police Department staffing incentives we need to take the time.,47,,
244,0.97,1662.927,1675.473,We need to take the time to ensure that we allow for the development of the most effective incentive program we can get in order to address the public safety crisis.,47,,
245,0.97,1675.473,1678.71,"Colleagues, we have rules for a reason.",47,,
246,0.97,1678.71,1687.519,"Let's follow them while maintaining a respect for Council President Juarez, who is not even here to defend her decision.",47,,
247,0.97,1687.519,1689.32,Thank you.,47,,
248,0.97,1689.32,1696.861,Thank you Councilmember Nelson.,48,,
249,0.97,1696.861,1698.196,Other comments from other Councilmembers?,48,,
250,0.97,1698.196,1698.73,I'm seeing no comments.,48,,
251,0.97,1698.73,1703.001,I will make a brief comment.,48,,
252,0.97,1703.001,1710.542,"Council member Pedersen and then I will make some remarks and give Councilmember Herbold the opportunity to close, as it is her motion.",48,,
253,0.97,1710.542,1712.61,"Go ahead, Councilmember Pedersen.",48,,
254,0.97,1712.61,1715.013,Thank you.,49,,
255,0.97,1715.013,1723.888,I appreciate that both Councilmembers want to address this.,49,,
256,0.97,1723.888,1740.805,I would like for us to have more clarity from the executive on the full array of tools that they think they need to get our hiring plan back on track and to retain the dedicated officers and detectives that Seattle is trying to hang onto.,49,,
257,0.97,1740.805,1752.283,In my district there is a great concern for many people about the reduction in police staffing that has occurred and want us to do everything we can.,49,,
258,0.97,1752.283,1756.321,"This may include moving expenses, as proposed by Councilmember Herbold.",49,,
259,0.97,1756.321,1766.03,"I also appreciate Councilmember Nelson, which provides maximum flexibility and presumably a larger dollar amount.",49,,
260,0.97,1766.03,1772.237,I'm looking forward to voting for Councilmember Nelson's resolution on May 12th.,49,,
261,0.97,1772.237,1784.649,"And then whenever we do take up, whether there are Subsets of that were moving expenses and other things, I would really like to hear from the executive.",49,,
262,0.97,1784.649,1786.851,I don't know if they need more time until May 24th.,49,,
263,0.97,1786.851,1795.193,But I would be interested in giving them that time so we can hear from them exactly what they need.,49,,
264,0.97,1795.193,1799.464,We are implementing the strategies in the right way the first time.,49,,
265,0.97,1799.464,1807.172,Thank you.,49,,
266,0.97,1807.172,1808.206,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",50,,
267,0.97,1808.206,1810.742,"Just to make a couple of brief remarks, this is a procedural motion.",50,,
268,0.97,1810.742,1821.519,I do appreciate the other elements about Council member Nelson's resolution and the bill presented by Councilmember Herbold have come into this discussion.,50,,
269,0.97,1821.519,1825.089,The comments to this procedural question in front of the Council.,50,,
270,0.97,1825.089,1835.066,"I will share couple of my thoughts, speaking as a fellow member of the Council on how I'm voting and why opt to vote that way.",50,,
271,0.97,1835.066,1857.255,"I agree with a lot of the points Councilmember Nelson has made about the structure of our rules and why we do set up the introduction referral calendar to effectively Queue up our legislative work and distribute legislation of the committees, and to allow sufficient notice for the public and Councilmembers of issues that will come before them.",50,,
272,0.97,1857.255,1898.129,"That said, I think there are some particular facts related to counsel bill 120320 which warrant approving Councilmember Herbold's request for this to be added to the IRC today . one of those issues, as Councilmember Herbold indicated, is the unique timing of when the public safety Committee, and this was something we discussed as we were reorganizing Council rules last fall, that this would present a potential problem to moving full counsel to Tuesday afternoons.",50,,
273,0.97,1898.129,1906.738,For many reasons that has been a worthy trade it's been great to have the Council briefing on different days.,50,,
274,0.97,1906.738,1920.518,"But one of those consequences is the awkwardness of having a Tuesday morning committee that is going to be in the position of potentially needing legislation in the pipeline and face undue delay, up to an additional week, for things to be fully considered.",50,,
275,0.97,1920.518,1927.959,Even with that caveat the rules are still important.,50,,
276,0.97,1927.959,1938.67,Which would be more germane if this counsel had been discussed in the previous meeting that Councilmember had last week.,50,,
277,0.97,1938.67,1941.105,This was discussed with the chief of police and other people present.,50,,
278,0.97,1941.105,1949.948,"It was introduced by Councilmember Herbold, at least in concept, and with text we could all read.",50,,
279,0.97,1949.948,1958.823,The bill has been repeated and reported on extensively . The media indicated that the public is certainly aware of this bill.,50,,
280,0.97,1958.823,1974.272,"Finally, just as a matter of policy that influences putting this on now, given that we have a staffing crisis, given that this is legislation that the Department has indicated a want.",50,,
281,0.97,1974.272,1988.72,"A delay of another week is something that I personally, if it can be avoided,--by putting this bill on now action can be taken earlier.",50,,
282,0.97,1988.72,1990.154,As Councilmember Herbold indicated.,50,,
283,0.97,1990.154,1997.061,These resources can be given to the Department to effectuate these changes on a faster Timeline.,50,,
284,0.97,1997.061,2006.804,"Just from a practical standpoint I think it makes sense given that there has been significant notice, public discussion, public debate on this bill.",50,,
285,0.97,2006.804,2014.112,And given that in practical terms we can get these resources to the Department more quickly.,50,,
286,0.97,2014.112,2018.816,For those purposes I will personally be voting in favor of this request from Councilmember Herbold.,50,,
287,0.97,2018.816,2037.168,"Councilmember Herbold, as it is your motion and as is our custom, you may make the final remarks.",50,,
288,0.97,2037.168,2038.202,Thank you so much.,51,,
289,0.97,2038.202,2039.47,I will make it really quick.,51,,
290,0.97,2039.47,2051.048,I just want to underscore that Council President Juarez is aware that I attempted to walk this on today.,51,,
291,0.97,2051.048,2060.124,Her process for when to expedite at this time is for a small Subset of circumstances.,51,,
292,0.97,2060.124,2062.66,I will be discussing that with her moving forward.,51,,
293,0.97,2062.66,2068.9,She was absolutely aware that my intention was to walk this on today.,51,,
294,0.97,2068.9,2090.755,"I just want to say, again, that to suggest that by following our own rules we are somehow circumventing the President's role is a very unusual thing to suggest and limits the ability of Councilmembers to support a routine parliamentary procedure.",51,,
295,0.97,2090.755,2106.003,"If the Council wants to tie our hands in this way totally walked things on when we have the Council Presidents blessing, I think we also have Council rules that are before us.",51,,
296,0.97,2106.003,2111.342,I think they are going to be coming to the full counsel soon and perhaps that would be a time to take up that matter.,51,,
297,0.97,2111.342,2111.642,Thank you.,51,,
298,0.97,2111.642,2112.844,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,52,,
299,0.97,2112.844,2115.813,Will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of the amendment?,52,,

393,0.97,2563.961,2576.574,-- Seattle city cops take credit as they Prioritize overtime at events and blame the homeless for everything that is wrong.,83,,
394,0.97,2576.574,2594.792,"The police chief is undermining efforts because Seattle cops, the majority, are not trained, nor willing, nor even bother, to focus on drug crimes that are destroying lives daily.",83,,
395,0.97,2594.792,2604.702,"Thanks to city Council and the Prosecutor's office still helping evil stay out of jail, no need for bail.",83,,
396,0.97,2604.702,2618.349,The city council should realize that wherever the media takes a picture of a crime Hotspot after the fact is the only place they dispatch a cop car to show force.,83,,
397,0.97,2618.349,2621.652,Yet they never jail the recent offenders who simply live a block away or around the corner.,83,,
398,0.97,2621.652,2624.755,Just look out City Hall windows toward third Avenue right now between James and Carrie.,83,,
399,0.97,2624.755,2633.097,"There is an evil open drug market right now, as I speak, where you cannot use the bus stop or go near it with kids because predators have taken over.",83,,
400,0.97,2633.097,2648.779,"Yet Metro transit bus drivers never notify Metro transit police, who use technicality involved, living it is not their responsibility to clear the area . It's a Seattle please they claim they are not responsible for clearing the area because it's Metro's responsibility.",83,,
401,0.97,2648.779,2656.62,This is a repeated dilemma that proves we have Untrustworthy city leaders.,83,,
