31,0.97,392.158,396.963,"Colleagues, as a reminder, group B consists of amendments that are amendments to the balancing package.",20,,
32,0.97,396.963,403.002,Most of these are slightly different options from items presented last week as part of the initial balancing package.,20,,
33,0.97,403.002,407.573,These include some new items that I believe will generally be supported by the committee.,20,,
34,0.97,407.573,420.353,And I'd like to provide an opportunity for central staff to describe each of the items included here in group B. some of these are items that for the first time folks will be hearing a little bit more detail about.,20,,
35,0.97,420.353,422.321,Central staff will walk through each item.,20,,
36,0.97,422.321,436.402,"And again colleagues for those who are sponsors and would like to lift up elements of their amendments that are included in this possible consent package, I would encourage you to speak to those items as central staff walks through each of the amendments included in group B.",20,,
37,0.97,436.402,443.576,"Again, these are items on our agenda, listed items number 160 to number 189.",20,,
38,0.97,443.576,449.882,The concepts will be familiar in large part because they touch on things that we've talked about over the last few weeks here.,20,,
39,0.97,449.882,454.02,But want to make sure you have a chance to hear about them in more detail.,20,,
40,0.97,454.02,476.976,"Colleagues, after we are done walking through all of the items in group B, after each of the Councilmembers has had a chance to lift up and explain some of the items that the central staff will be summarizing for us, we will then have the opportunity to consider removing any item from this consent package before you vote on the consent package.",20,,
41,0.97,476.976,481.247,"Again, you'll have the opportunity to remove any item if you so desire to have a single vote on it.",20,,

43,0.97,484.45,489.355,"So with that, are there any questions about group B? okay.",20,,

56,0.97,561.894,576.142,"As chair Mosqueda said, we have 30 items in group B. I'll have my central staff, colleagues briefly describe the item, starting with my colleague Anne Gorman on the first item.",22,,
57,0.97,576.142,582.949,"Good afternoon, this item is Cscc 2B 1 and it's sponsored by Councilmember Lewis.",23,,
58,0.97,582.949,600.499,"A previous amendment proposed funding in the human services Department at the $3.1 million level to work with city public safety departments on a requested proposal, select a community provider and implement the provision in the Referenced response.",23,,
59,0.97,600.499,613.746,This approach commits funding in the community safety and communication center for response planning only rather than planning and deployment.,23,,
60,0.97,613.746,614.113,Thank you.,24,,
61,0.97,614.113,621.454,"Councilmember Lewis, would you like to add anything else to this summary?",24,,
62,0.97,621.454,623.823,I appreciate Anne's summary.,25,,
63,0.97,623.823,647.713,I would briefly say that I think this is going to be a really important investment to work towards our common goals of Council which is to resource our 911 response center to stand up and deploy alternative responses for things that a lot of us agree that an alternative response could go to to respond to our current public safety crisis.,25,,
64,0.97,647.713,649.982,And I appreciate working with Anne on this.,25,,
65,0.97,649.982,652.918,I don't have any other technical things to add to it.,25,,
66,0.97,652.918,655.121,I'll Reserve other comments for the discussion.,25,,

70,0.97,670.036,671.437,I'm on your Council central staff.,28,,
71,0.97,671.437,681.447,This is a slide FAS 3B 1. this would request the Finance administrative services Department report on increased efficiencies and animal patrolling.,28,,
72,0.97,681.447,692.291,"The purpose of this is to down the line increase and improve patrolling on leash laws, and scoop laws in the parks, it's sponsored by Councilmember Herbold.",28,,

74,0.97,696.595,699.465,Thank you.,30,,
75,0.97,699.465,724.39,"Just super briefly, I have another budget action in the earlier round that would proviso funds to be consistent with past practices that the Council has taken in efforts to increase funding for the animal control to actually focus on the work enforcing the leash and scoop laws in the parks.",30,,
76,0.97,724.39,739.371,"Unfortunately, despite our efforts over two budget years, those dollar--those funds are still being used to support other animal control functions.",30,,
77,0.97,739.371,749.915,"Taking office, I consistently heard from constituents who are concerned about better enforcement of scoop and leash laws in the parks.",30,,
78,0.97,749.915,762.161,"And in 2017, the budget we worked on got funding for an additional position and funding for vehicle in the 2019 budget we added another ACL position.",30,,
79,0.97,762.161,770.803,"Since the budget adds, there's been no increase in the number of Acos at parks.",30,,
80,0.97,770.803,779.812,And the--there's just one team of two Acos patrolling all of Seattle's parks.,30,,
81,0.97,779.812,805.471,"And just hoping that since there wasn't support in the earlier round to proviso funds that we've all ready allocated for this purpose to ensure that they were actually going to be used for this purpose since there wasn't support for that in the prior budget round, I'm just hoping that a report from the animal shelter will shine a light on this issue and allow for more conversation in next year's budget process.",30,,
82,0.97,805.471,807.473,Thank you Councilmember.,31,,
83,0.97,807.473,812.278,Let's move on to 162.,31,,
84,0.97,812.278,817.817,Item 162 is CBA FAS 5C1.,31,,
85,0.97,817.817,821.287,"It would add $110,000 of General fund to FAS.",31,,
86,0.97,821.287,823.989,"And $250,000 of General Fund.",31,,
87,0.97,823.989,831.497,A grants and contracts specialist for a victim compensation Fund and community based organizational support.,31,,
88,0.97,831.497,836.402,Fas 5c 1 differs slightly from FAS 5 B 1 in two ways.,31,,
89,0.97,836.402,839.705,It adds the seniors grants and contracts specialist.,31,,
90,0.97,839.705,845.311,And uses some of the funding that would have gone to the community based organizations to support that position.,31,,
91,0.97,845.311,863.195,It also includes a little bit of additional language that asks for reporting back about the number of cases that would have been eligible for victim--excuse me for diversion if not for restitution requirements.,31,,
92,0.97,863.195,868.334,"It's sponsored by Councilmember Lewis and cosponsored by Councilmembers Herbold, Morales, and Strauss.",31,,

95,0.97,874.273,876.408,Thank you for Cueing that up.,33,,
96,0.97,876.408,882.548,"You know, victim compensation is a Foundational value of restorative justice practices.",33,,
97,0.97,882.548,891.257,Restorative justice does not ask for anybody to go on without being made whole as a victim of crime.,33,,
98,0.97,891.257,901.367,It SEEKS for Holistic understanding in making victims hole as a Foundational part of how we're accountable to each other.,33,,
99,0.97,901.367,918.284,"Despite those principles being core to restorative justice, the city of Seattle to this date has not had in our criminal legal system any way for victims to access some kind of support of this nature.",33,,
100,0.97,918.284,938.904,"Despite investing very heavily in a significant amount of diversion programs, community court, and other restorative ways to adjudicate criminal legal matters as alternatives to the traditional courts and surveillance and probation.",33,,
101,0.97,938.904,959.692,"This will allow us to make sure that this critical component of victims walking away feeling like they've been heard and tat an injury they've sustained has been made whole to the best ability that we can do Programmatically for Misdemeanors, this will close that gap in our current system.",33,,
102,0.97,959.692,971.537,So I really look forward to this being part of the various tools that we have to have a more just city and I appreciate the community Stakeholderring in this.,33,,

107,0.97,981.58,995.26,"I do want to note, we're trying to do a quick overview orientation, if there's more to add to an item that we're excited about, I'm going to ask for the comments to be held until we summarize all excitement for group B if that's okay.",34,,
108,0.97,995.26,996.028,Thank you very much.,34,,
109,0.97,996.028,998.664,I'll put you first in the Cue.,34,,

112,0.97,1005.27,1022.721,"The next item, this is the omnibus amendment that would restore expenditures to the amounts and purposes prescribed in 126393 and Reallocating one time funds and acknowledging 2021 carry to support community led investments.",34,,
113,0.97,1022.721,1026.025,We spent a fair am of time discussing this amendment in committee.,34,,
114,0.97,1026.025,1029.762,I won't go into all of the details for all the items covered in this amendment.,34,,
115,0.97,1029.762,1036.835,I'm just going to highlight a few things that have changed since the last--since the last discussion.,34,,
116,0.97,1036.835,1059.658,"So changes in this option for this amendment include some modifications, the previous version included $4.4 million of one-time Federal dollars, Coronavirus, local, Federal relief funds, to be used for services paired with emergency housing vouchers and city funded or Noncity funded buildings.",34,,
117,0.97,1059.658,1062.628,For technical reasons and program implementation.,34,,
118,0.97,1062.628,1064.763,The chair submitted an amendment to modify that.,34,,
119,0.97,1064.763,1070.502,Those services are now supported by jump start funds and was increased to 7.3 million.,34,,
120,0.97,1070.502,1076.475,And that was included--that's included in amendment Oh 15A1.,34,,
121,0.97,1076.475,1085.717,"So with that, the $4.4 million of Clipper funds previously proposed to be used to support those services are used for other purposes.",34,,
122,0.97,1085.717,1098.096,This includes 1 million Cole dollars to the office of housing for very services and capacity funding for nonprofit housing providers operating housing projects.,34,,
123,0.97,1098.096,1105.571,Councilmember Herbold submitted an amendment to that piece sponsored by both Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Mosqueda.,34,,
124,0.97,1105.571,1110.609,"$308,000 to the office of Sustainability and the environment for a pilot prescription food program.",34,,

126,0.97,1118.684,1120.786,Such as the Seattle Indian health board.,34,,
127,0.97,1120.786,1127.826,That proposal was submitted by Councilmember Morales.,34,,
128,0.97,1127.826,1142.407,"And $435--excuse me, $435,000 to the Seattle public libraries to support repairs from vandalism that have occurred over the last couple years.",34,,
129,0.97,1142.407,1167.833,"The combination of these actions allowed chair Mosqueda in her revised balancing package to change some of the resources that were originally supporting the package that includes no longer making reductions to the Seattle it departments and in the next item, no longer relying on a reduction to the contribution to fiscal reserves.",34,,
130,0.97,1167.833,1197.729,"In addition, in the primal hours of putting the revised package together, central staff Imrf identified an error that identified jump start fund dollars that had not been allocated so Councilmember Mosqueda included jump start funding for a proposal submitted by Councilmember Morales providing 120,000 collars to Sdot for investments to improve the Columbia city patio.",34,,
131,0.97,1197.729,1198.23,Excellent.,35,,
132,0.97,1198.23,1199.264,Thank you so much.,35,,

134,0.97,1200.866,1203.101,I'll briefly add to what Allie noted.,35,,
135,0.97,1203.101,1209.308,There's a number of items Councilmembers suggested they would like to see included via some amendments.,35,,
136,0.97,1209.308,1215.48,"Councilmember Juarez was asking about the impact on libraries, we're excited to get the language included.",35,,
137,0.97,1215.48,1221.153,Councilmember Morales noting your support for the patio effort that you had asked for in your district.,35,,
138,0.97,1221.153,1228.827,And also this is in response to the conversation that we have been having with folks at the regional homelessness authority.,35,,
139,0.97,1228.827,1238.77,Thanks to mark and their crew for all the work they've done to help flag how we can make sure these dollars are Resonating with what the community partners need to see in terms of stability.,35,,
140,0.97,1238.77,1241.707,Happy to have been able to work on this.,35,,
141,0.97,1241.707,1249.114,And apply this modification for a short-term modification so that we can address some of those concerns.,35,,
142,0.97,1249.114,1254.152,"And with that, I think we can go to next one.",35,,
143,0.97,1255.954,1274.239,"Item 164 is budget action FG 6B 1-2022 this action would add $400,000 general fund to finance general for the purpose of increasing the transfer to the revenue stabilization fund.",36,,
144,0.97,1274.239,1280.412,The budget as proposed included $15 million to the revenue stabilization fund.,36,,
145,0.97,1280.412,1281.446,"This Woulded add $400,000.",36,,
146,0.97,1281.446,1286.218,Bringing the total to 15.4 million.,36,,
147,0.97,1286.218,1291.256,Which is $12.3 million higher than would be strictly required in the Reserve policy.,36,,
148,0.97,1291.256,1294.426,So I would just NOTE on a technical basis.,36,,
149,0.97,1294.426,1298.063,That the transactions and the titles are correct on this.,36,,
150,0.97,1298.063,1302.868,"However, the description attached to the agenda reflects to a prior Deliberative draft.",36,,
151,0.97,1302.868,1309.608,And that will be updated through a technical adjustment on Monday.,36,,
152,0.97,1328.326,1336.034,We continue to make sure we're a lining investments right now.,36,,
153,0.97,1336.034,1356.922,I'm excited we were able to not only protect these reserves but be able to add a small cushion back makes me feel like we're helping to protect working families in the situation we may find ourselves in if there's continuing Variants.,36,,
154,0.97,1356.922,1358.857,I'm adding to the existing reserves there.,36,,
155,0.97,1358.857,1362.361,That's something I'm excited about and I wanted to lift up for all of you.,36,,
156,0.97,1362.361,1364.396,I think we can move to 165.,36,,
157,0.97,1364.396,1371.837,"For the record, council central staff, item 165 is a statement of legislative intent.",37,,

160,0.97,1383.782,1400.265,"Compared to prior version, this adds an assessment discussing the theory and process underlining the are posed system and integration that the authority will come up with for all homeless services as the Rfp for services is developed next spring and issued and responded to by providers.",37,,
161,0.97,1400.265,1405.737,All the pieces previously discussed related to peer navigation and homelessness services are all retained.,37,,

244,0.97,1922.22,1923.655,Is that right?,52,,
245,0.97,1923.655,1929.093,Item 171 is Hsd 25C1.,53,,
246,0.97,1929.093,1937.402,"It would add $50,000 general fund to Hsd to contract with an organization to survey national best practices on interrupting gun violence.",53,,

251,0.97,1960.858,1964.529,And the big difference here is--excuse me?,55,,

257,0.97,1974.539,1976.14,That's okay.,57,,
258,0.97,1976.14,1983.081,The biggest difference here is that we're including some resources for the city auditor to follow through on some of the recommendations that they have.,57,,
259,0.97,1983.081,1991.689,But we want to make sure that there's Connectivity between that body of work and the work that's going to occur through this contract.,57,,
260,0.97,1991.689,1995.493,I appreciate Councilmember Herbold bringing this change forward.,57,,
261,0.97,1995.493,2011.275,And of course it was at her request that we are making this particular change and I'm supportive of the proposal that the city auditor participate in development of evaluation of the human services Department community safety Cohort.,57,,
262,0.97,2011.275,2028.826,Connecting these bodies of work will serve to ensure that as the city continues the work finding responses to community safety outside of traditional law enforcement that our endeavors are all landing on the same page and highly coordinated.,57,,
263,0.97,2028.826,2031.295,This is reflective of that intent.,57,,
264,0.97,2031.295,2034.132,Number 172.,58,,
265,0.97,2036.234,2047.612,"Item 172, Procedurally, Councilmember Morales, did you want to speak to this one?",59,,
266,0.97,2047.612,2047.979,Sure.,60,,

269,0.97,2056.554,2059.757,We can skip it for now.,61,,

273,0.97,2066.931,2072.236,This is a new item but it's fairly technical in a nature.,62,,
274,0.97,2072.236,2077.208,"It adds $600,000 to Hsd for their Finance team.",62,,
275,0.97,2077.208,2097.495,"The 2022 proposed budget included $600,000 in finance general reserves as the city budget office worked with Hsd to determine what additional staffing resources they needed on the Finance team to PLO vied support to ensure the Department is complying with grant requirements.",62,,
276,0.97,2097.495,2101.999,This is a reflection of the significant growth in Hsd's budget over the last few years.,62,,
277,0.97,2101.999,2120.384,So this is an amendment sponsored by chair Mosqueda in order to ensure that those positions Ared added and funding for the first part of the year is provided and we expect either under spend or a supplemental budget action in 2022 to provide the remaining funding.,62,,
278,0.97,2120.384,2129.827,Just NOTE these positions have all ready been authorized on an emergency basis by the city budget director who has the authority to do that under limited circumstances.,62,,
279,0.97,2129.827,2136.3,So this would make this--make those pockets permanent and moves the funding out of reserves.,62,,
280,0.97,2136.3,2137.702,Thank you very much.,63,,
281,0.97,2137.702,2143.274,"Allie, I will also just NOTE this is an item flagged for us after the budget was transmitted from the Mayor's office.",63,,
282,0.97,2143.274,2147.011,It was flagged for us by the executive and CBO as a need.,63,,
283,0.97,2147.011,2150.515,And we are trying to work to accommodate that request here.,63,,
284,0.97,2150.515,2154.685,So I don't have anything else to add to what Allie just noted.,63,,
285,0.97,2154.685,2160.958,But making sure we're complying with Federal grants in addition to making sure the grants we're authorizing in the city go to the right people.,63,,
286,0.97,2160.958,2162.126,It's really important.,63,,
287,0.97,2162.126,2169.867,I'm happy to include this year to make sure there's additional capacity.,63,,
288,0.97,2169.867,2170.067,Okay.,63,,

293,0.97,2190.655,2204.435,"Where as the earlier version which we're still working at that point to obtain specific information on certain programs, more in general talking about behavioral health services provides the exact program.",64,,

295,0.97,2206.504,2208.472,Anything to add to this?,64,,

310,0.97,2236.233,2243.307,And this is similar to the previous CBA in that this is essentially the envisions of the lead program.,69,,
311,0.97,2243.307,2247.645,The prior version only added $3.5 million.,69,,

327,0.97,2313.544,2330.961,This is a new statement of legislative intent but one that asks the city attorney's office to work with the human services Department on a plan to transition over the existing contracts that the city attorney's office has with community based organizations doing the Prefiling diversion work.,73,,
328,0.97,2330.961,2348.746,"So rather than transferring them immediately to avoid any kind of service disruption in the current existing Prefiling program, the sly asks that Hsd and law work together to figure out how to move the contracts over without any service disruption.",73,,
329,0.97,2348.746,2359.156,And do that hopefully by the mid year supplemental.,73,,
330,0.97,2359.156,2361.826,I don't have much to add.,73,,
331,0.97,2361.826,2363.227,Asha did a fine job there.,73,,
332,0.97,2363.227,2365.396,Let's keep going.,73,,
333,0.97,2365.396,2371.202,"Yolanda, council central staff on to agenda item 177.",74,,
334,0.97,2371.202,2373.904,This is D 11A1 sponsored by Councilmember Morales.,74,,
335,0.97,2373.904,2379.243,This is a new statement of legislative intent.,74,,
336,0.97,2379.243,2379.877,Not previously discussed.,74,,
337,0.97,2379.877,2404.502,The statement would request the office of economic development office of housing and the office of planning community development create a plan to coordinate their strategies for funding development projects intended to prevent community displacement to ensure the city's investments are strategically aligned and responsive to community needs with a focus on the new $7.6 million small business ownership fund in Oed.,74,,
338,0.97,2404.502,2413.911,This report would be due to community economic development committee or successor on June 3RD 2022.,74,,
339,0.97,2413.911,2414.345,Wonderful.,74,,
340,0.97,2414.345,2414.678,Thank you.,74,,
341,0.97,2414.678,2416.313,"Please go ahead, Councilmember.",74,,
342,0.97,2416.313,2425.422,"Thank you, colleagues, this is really just about trying to increase the Intentionality with our Department resources and initiatives.",75,,
343,0.97,2425.422,2430.394,We do have a new initiative here in the office of economic development.,75,,
344,0.97,2430.394,2436.434,And it's really critical that every Department really focus their work on how to serve the goals of anti displacement.,75,,
345,0.97,2436.434,2454.885,"So whether we're talking about economic development or land use or housing, I want to make sure that our departments are acknowledging their role in keeping Seattle affordable for everyone and working together.",75,,
346,0.97,2454.885,2457.488,These departments have been coordinating on an ad hoc basis.,75,,
347,0.97,2457.488,2470.1,And this slide is asking them to really just develop a plan for how they will coordinate their approach to funding community projects.,75,,
348,0.97,2470.1,2482.713,"Honestly, I feel like they could benefit from a little structure and clarifying goals together about how they will do grant applications and how they will respond to community requests for funding.",75,,
349,0.97,2482.713,2486.283,So that is the intent behind this slide.,75,,
350,0.97,2486.283,2487.551,Thank you Councilmember.,76,,
351,0.97,2487.551,2490.054,Let's continue with the next one.,76,,
352,0.97,2493.257,2499.23,"Council central staff, moving to item 178.",77,,
353,0.97,2499.23,2499.763,Sly Oh 13A001.,77,,
354,0.97,2499.763,2504.902,This was previously Hsd 23B 001.,77,,
355,0.97,2504.902,2505.169,Same sly.,77,,
356,0.97,2505.169,2513.844,This would have Oh and the Seattle municipal court working with the King County regional home homeless authority.,77,,
357,0.97,2513.844,2516.747,To support individuals involved in the criminal legal justice system.,77,,
358,0.97,2516.747,2523.754,The only change here is replacing office of housing with the human services Department.,77,,
359,0.97,2523.754,2529.994,Office of housing seemed a more Appropriae agency to work on housing vouchers since they have more involvement with those than Hsd does.,77,,
360,0.97,2529.994,2532.162,Otherwise the sly is the same.,77,,
361,0.97,2532.162,2536.233,This is sponsored by Councilmember Lewis.,77,,
362,0.97,2536.233,2541.005,With cosponsors Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Strauss.,77,,
363,0.97,2541.005,2542.473,"Councilmember Lewis, please go ahead.",77,,
364,0.97,2542.473,2544.775,"Thank you for Scaling that up there, Tracy.",77,,
365,0.97,2544.775,2546.577,I don't really have all that much to add.,77,,
366,0.97,2546.577,2556.954,I mean just to under score that this really came out of working with Judge Gregory and judge Hadid.,77,,
367,0.97,2556.954,2564.328,Who indicated a long running interest to divert people into some kind of housing placement as an alternative to the criminal legal system.,77,,
368,0.97,2564.328,2569.833,This is currently not something they have resources for or the ability to do.,77,,
369,0.97,2569.833,2570.834,To their great frustration.,77,,
370,0.97,2570.834,2580.711,"And they see lots of people continue to cycle through their court, where housing and stability is frankly the reason they're engaged in survival crime and constantly stuck in that cycle.",77,,
371,0.97,2580.711,2597.962,So something like this could be a great resource to allow those judges to bring some resources to bear to get folks out of the criminal legal system and out of their court and on a path to stability and to break that cycle.,77,,
372,0.97,2597.962,2604.101,I think this is a good start to look into how we can bring that around to a reality.,77,,
373,0.97,2604.101,2605.102,So thank you.,77,,
374,0.97,2605.102,2612.376,Thank you very much.,78,,
375,0.97,2612.376,2613.277,All right.,78,,

377,0.97,2613.61,2613.811,Cba.,78,,
378,0.97,2613.811,2627.091,"This CBA would cut $6 million of jump start funds in Hsd for services paired with emergency housing vouchers, cut 1.3 million of jump start funds and Oh for Multilanding Lening.",78,,
379,0.97,2627.091,2632.463,Services paired with emergency housing vouchers and R if services and city funded housing units.,78,,
380,0.97,2632.463,2644.441,This is--this concept or this Funning was previously included in the jump start Redistribute or Reprioritizing or Reprogramming CBA.,78,,
381,0.97,2644.441,2649.646,We pulled it out as its own separate CBA to be really clear about that funding and where it's going.,78,,
382,0.97,2649.646,2666.163,And then the amount was slightly increased to accommodate thoughts from the community about the need for services spending both for the emergency housing vouchers but also for the permanent supportive housing and it's for homeless individuals that will come Online.,78,,
383,0.97,2666.163,2668.799,That needed service dollars as well.,78,,
384,0.97,2668.799,2671.235,Councilmember Mosqueda is the sponsor.,78,,
385,0.97,2671.235,2673.003,Thank you for your work on this.,78,,
386,0.97,2673.003,2682.713,This was part of the omnibus amendment that we had considered over the last few weeks here.,78,,
387,0.97,2682.713,2686.183,With folks in the community and the region snail homelessness authority.,78,,
388,0.97,2686.183,2689.219,We're trying to address overlapping service needs throughout the budget.,78,,
389,0.97,2689.219,2708.806,And making sure that there are opportunities with the Turnkey rapid acquisition and permanent supportive housing projects that are Online at the end of the year and beginning next year and to support the emergency housing vouchers that have been allocated to the Seattle housing authority on a very tight Timeline that ends in July of 2022.,78,,
390,0.97,2708.806,2752.716,Using the office of housing expertise and service provisions for city funded buildings and the relationship with State and funding partners and deep partnership with the King County regional homelessness authority we're looking forward to Leveraging the homelessness authorities connections and focus on smaller service providers the CBA will allow us to meet the service needs in the Timeline in front of us and provide flexibility to the city to work in partnership with and contract with the regional homelessness authority on the approach they're contemplating to provide informed and continuous services to those who are the highest risk and most marginalized populations to ensure individuals housed with voucher Haves the services they need.,78,,
391,0.97,2752.716,2778.876,I appreciate the conversations we've had with King County regional homelessness authority and the role they're working on to continue to create an administratively consolidated and streamlined system for contracting services with those Experiening homelessness and look forward to making sure we continue to identify ongoing revenue needs in the future to address this to pair these emergency housing vouchers with Noncity funded units.,78,,
392,0.97,2778.876,2782.479,Thank you so much.,78,,
393,0.97,2788.152,2798.862,Council central staff is a new statement of legislative intent from sponsored by Councilmember Morales requesting Opcd report on opportunities to support community investment trusts.,78,,
394,0.97,2798.862,2814.244,Community investment trusts are alternative development financing tools to allow members of the community to make small dollar investments in their neighborhoods building wealth and supporting community investment.,78,,
395,0.97,2815.612,2817.548,Councilmember Morales.,79,,
396,0.97,2817.548,2818.048,Thank you.,79,,

398,0.97,2820.784,2820.984,Yes.,79,,
399,0.97,2820.984,2836.667,"So the interesting and exciting opportunity here is that this kind of investment tool provides both an alternative source of financing for these projects, but also ensures the profits from development projects are returned to community.",79,,
400,0.97,2836.667,2849.413,And so we did have a few proposed projects for both Edi and for the strategic investment funds that indicated an interest in using this kind of a tool.,79,,
401,0.97,2849.413,2863.794,And so this sly requests that Opcd work with at least two community partners who were interested in using this as a funding model and report back on the opportunities that the city might have to continue to support these efforts.,79,,
402,0.97,2864.261,2865.229,Thank you.,80,,
403,0.97,2865.229,2866.93,Let's go on.,81,,
404,0.97,2868.165,2897.127,Next item is Osc 3B 1 sponsored by Councilmember Pedersen a statement of legislative intent that was discussed previously as Osc 3A 1. the statement of legislative intent would request the office of Sustainability and environment and the parks and recreation develop a plan to phase out the use of all gas powered leaf Blowers in Seattle within two years.,82,,
405,0.97,2897.127,2907.137,The difference between this version and the previous version is that the day is changed from June 3RD to September 2ND.,82,,
406,0.97,2907.137,2915.412,And there's some additional language to consider impacts of the plan for longer health and safety.,82,,
407,0.97,2915.412,2917.08,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,83,,
408,0.97,2917.08,2917.914,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,84,,

410,0.97,2920.384,2924.254,I appreciate the chair including it in this consent package.,84,,
411,0.97,2924.254,2942.439,"We've had dozens of constituents send Emails to us in support of this effort to phase out harmful leaf Blowers, as we know, the two stroke gasoline fueled engines are terrible noise polluters and particulate matter polluters and we've seen an increasing trend across the nation to restrict these machines.",84,,
412,0.97,2942.439,2946.843,Including a brand new law phasing them out in the state of California.,84,,
413,0.97,2946.843,2955.986,"As Yolanda mentioned, this slide adds language regarding health and safety impacts.",84,,
414,0.97,2955.986,2964.194,"Unfortunately, the effectiveness of quieter and cleaner electric powered leaf Blowers improved a lot since the previous city council considered this idea several years ago.",84,,
415,0.97,2964.194,2971.835,I look forward to receiving a solid plan to implement a new policy that is friendlier to our environment.,84,,
416,0.97,2971.835,2972.102,Thank you.,84,,
417,0.97,2972.536,2974.638,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,85,,
418,0.97,2974.638,2979.543,Thank you for being amenable to adding the language about the impact on health and safety for workers.,85,,
419,0.97,2979.543,2983.013,I think it will also be interesting to see.,85,,
420,0.97,2983.013,2985.549,All right.,85,,
421,0.97,2985.549,2990.921,Let's continue on.,85,,
422,0.97,2990.921,2992.422,Item 182.,86,,
423,0.97,2992.422,3000.731,"7C 1. this action would add $145,000 to Sdci for consultant support for a rental market study.",86,,
424,0.97,3000.731,3008.338,"The previous option discussed by this committee would have added $75,000 for a study.",86,,
425,0.97,3008.338,3018.281,With the remainder of the funding to provide policy development support to the code compliance group.,86,,
426,0.97,3018.281,3022.185,This option focuses the investment on the study itself.,86,,
427,0.97,3022.185,3027.424,To provide a broader scope for Council consideration of policy options in the future.,86,,
428,0.97,3027.424,3030.827,This is sponsored by Councilmember Strauss.,86,,
429,0.97,3030.827,3032.295,Thank you Councilmember please go ahead.,86,,
430,0.97,3032.295,3044.641,"Thank you, chair, s the my amendment to fund an outside consultant to conduct the city of seal's rental market to replace data we used to receive.",87,,
431,0.97,3044.641,3047.811,"Unfortunately, Dupree and Scott stop producing the report.",87,,
432,0.97,3047.811,3051.248,The balancing package you created thank you included this work.,87,,
433,0.97,3051.248,3061.758,And it split it between a study and the .5 FTE as he just mentioned after speaking with Stakeholders and other sponsors.,87,,
434,0.97,3061.758,3071.068,We decided it would make more sense to focus the funding on the study for now so we can ensure we receive that comprehensive data set for us to take action on in the future.,87,,
435,0.97,3071.068,3073.537,Thank you to all the colleagues that worked on this.,87,,
436,0.97,3073.537,3076.273,Thank you chair.,87,,
437,0.97,3076.873,3078.275,Thank you very much.,88,,
438,0.97,3078.275,3079.709,Let's keep going.,88,,
439,0.97,3079.709,3081.845,Council central staff.,89,,
440,0.97,3081.845,3095.959,Itm 183 is a new statement of legislative intent s DOT 11A 1 would request s DOT provide reporting on the West Seattle bridge immediate response program which is expected to reopen to traffic in mid 2022.,89,,
441,0.97,3095.959,3102.165,This is a continuation of a statement of legislative intent on reporting that Council approved in last year's budget.,89,,
442,0.97,3102.165,3104.768,It's offered by Councilmember Herbold.,89,,
443,0.97,3105.869,3109.039,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",90,,
444,0.97,3109.039,3113.376,Thank you so much.,91,,
445,0.97,3113.376,3113.643,So yes.,91,,
446,0.97,3113.643,3121.151,This is the latest and greatest on the West Seattle bridge sly.,91,,
447,0.97,3121.151,3126.389,It's very similar to a few requests we made last year.,91,,
448,0.97,3126.389,3133.296,Requests that the Sdot report monthly about the progress on the bridge repair.,91,,
449,0.97,3133.296,3136.466,Which the notice to proceed should be issued any day now.,91,,
450,0.97,3136.466,3150.614,I think the main difference from the updates requested in this that mirror those from last year is that it also includes an expectation.,91,,
451,0.97,3150.614,3162.826,Sdot will alert Councilmembers as soon as possible if there are any changes to the schedule for the mid 2022 completion.,91,,
452,0.97,3162.826,3168.565,Target and any changes to the schedule for opening up the bridge to traffic.,91,,
453,0.97,3169.232,3171.501,"Wonderful, thank you very much.",92,,
454,0.97,3171.501,3173.47,"Next item, please.",92,,
455,0.97,3174.437,3186.249,Item 184 is Sfd 4A1 a statement of legislative intent requesting that the Seattle fire Department report on its work and costs to launch the triage 1 program.,93,,
456,0.97,3186.249,3188.318,This is a new amendment.,93,,
457,0.97,3188.318,3203.099,It establishes dimensions and dates for Sfd to provide a series of reports on its implementation of the triage one program including its alignment with other departments and Stakeholders and with related funding commitments.,93,,
458,0.97,3203.099,3204.634,This is sponsored by Councilmember Herbold.,93,,
459,0.97,3204.634,3205.235,Councilmember Herbold.,94,,
460,0.97,3205.235,3207.637,Thank you so much.,95,,
461,0.97,3207.637,3220.65,So this sly is issued because of some of the information that we've learned about the status of standing up the triage one program through the budget discussions.,95,,
462,0.97,3220.65,3228.224,Folks may recall that in the mid year budget adjustment that was made in early August.,95,,
463,0.97,3228.224,3238.068,We had actually included some funding for the triage one Rogram out of the understanding that the funding would help them in the development of the program.,95,,
464,0.97,3238.068,3264.728,"And with the understanding that at that point that launching triage one would likely, based on the number of weeks and months it would take to completed each of the steps associated with launching this program that we would be able to launch the program probably late second quarter 2022 or early third quarter 2022.",95,,
465,0.97,3264.728,3266.997,We're now learning that that's not the case.,95,,
466,0.97,3266.997,3282.712,"Despite the fact that when there was this launch earlier this week, in the spring, it really sounded like it was--or rather in August, it sounded like the launch was something that was imminent.",95,,
467,0.97,3282.712,3286.716,So what this sly does in recognizing that the launch isn't imminent.,95,,
468,0.97,3286.716,3302.165,"And there are a lot of steps that the executive hasn't been able to start taking yet, it requests that the fire Department report back to the public safety committee with a series of progress reports on the launch of the program that was announced in August.",95,,
469,0.97,3302.165,3315.912,Reporting dates were estimated from information received by the fire Department on the steps needed to stand up the program with the first report being due at the end of January.,95,,
470,0.97,3315.912,3324.821,Requests that the Cscc report back to Council on the implementation of the protocol system funded by the Council in the mid year supplemental.,95,,
471,0.97,3324.821,3327.757,The report is due at the end of June.,95,,
472,0.97,3327.757,3343.039,"And Councilmembers will recollect the acquisition, implementation in training on the protocol system is a prerequisite for additional Nonpolice responses.",95,,
473,0.97,3343.039,3357.02,"Who you're talking about triage one or you're talking about another crisis response, who its a program outside the city or another program from within the city.",95,,
474,0.97,3357.02,3363.159,"So that protocol system and the status of it, it's really, really important to our ongoing work here, thank you.",95,,
475,0.97,3363.626,3367.03,"Excellent, thank you.",96,,
476,0.97,3367.03,3367.364,Let's continue.,96,,
477,0.97,3368.431,3376.005,185 is CBA SMC 3A 1.,97,,
478,0.97,3376.005,3379.809,"Provides 88,000 for electronic home monitoring and requests reporting on its use.",97,,
479,0.97,3379.809,3382.479,This is a new CBA.,97,,
480,0.97,3382.479,3391.321,"In the proposed budget, the Mayor added $88,000 to subsidize electronic home monitoring.",97,,
481,0.97,3391.321,3410.039,"This would allow defendants that were otherwise indigent and couldn't afford Ehm to be able to use that in lieu of Incarceration, this CBA place as proviso on the funding that requires the court to submit data on the use of Ehm in the past.",97,,
482,0.97,3410.039,3418.681,"The data such as demographics, which offenses Ehm is used on.",97,,
483,0.97,3418.681,3420.483,A variety of other data points.,97,,
484,0.97,3420.483,3430.86,And asks that SMC continue to report that data back on a quarterly basis to the public safety and human services committee or its successor.,97,,
485,0.97,3430.86,3432.862,The sponsor is Councilmember Morales.,97,,
486,0.97,3432.862,3435.965,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Morales, please go ahead.",98,,
487,0.97,3435.965,3443.84,"Thank you, I don't have a lot to add except to say I think it's important to get a good understanding of who is Úusing this.",99,,
488,0.97,3443.84,3456.419,"You know, part of the reason for funding in the first place is because if you are given the option to use electronic home monitoring rather than stay in jail, you have to pay for it.",99,,
489,0.97,3456.419,3462.926,And so this is allowing folks who would not be able to pay for it to have that option so they don't have to stay in jail.,99,,
490,0.97,3462.926,3480.944,But we really want to get a clear understanding of who is using it and use that information down the road to make an assessment of whether this is a tool that we should continue to use or if there's some other option for keeping folks supporting them as they're moving through this journey.,99,,
491,0.97,3480.944,3486.049,"Thank you very much, Councilmember.",100,,
492,0.97,3486.049,3487.45,"Moving on, 186.",100,,
493,0.97,3487.45,3493.59,"Greg Doss, council central staff here to talk about a couple noncontroversial slides.",101,,
494,0.97,3493.59,3497.861,Item number 186 is a statement of legislative intent that's new.,101,,
495,0.97,3497.861,3500.263,It's sponsored by Councilmember Herbold.,101,,
496,0.97,3500.263,3528.424,The statement of legislative intent would require SPD provide quarterly reports to the public safety and human services Committee on the Department's effort to identify a potential Nonswarm response for 911 call types identified in the National Institute for criminal justice reform or Nick Junior report that categorized many different call types as potential call types for appropriate civilian responses.,101,,
497,0.97,3528.424,3536.399,"And that would be provided quarterly on April 1st, July 1ST, and October 1ST.",101,,
498,0.97,3536.399,3540.236,"Please go ahead, Councilmember",102,,
499,0.97,3540.236,3544.14,Not too much to add.,103,,
500,0.97,3544.14,3554.417,I appreciate Greg's characterization.,103,,
501,0.97,3554.417,3573.202,I feel like there's a little mismatch on the expectations that the Council has based on statements that SPD itself has said Abou the speed at which we can begin transferring some of these calls to Non-Sworn response.,103,,
502,0.97,3573.202,3574.137,But I agree with Greg.,103,,
503,0.97,3574.137,3579.542,But the sly itself is not controversial.,103,,
504,0.97,3579.542,3579.809,Thank you.,103,,
505,0.97,3580.977,3581.477,Excellent.,103,,
506,0.97,3581.477,3582.245,Thank you so much.,103,,
507,0.97,3582.245,3585.782,Let's move on to the next noncontroversial item.,103,,
508,0.97,3585.782,3586.916,Thank you Councilmembers.,104,,
509,0.97,3586.916,3594.524,I mean it's good to staff two things in this session that are not controversial.,104,,
510,0.97,3594.524,3620.95,"A statement of legislative intent by the chair, Councilmember Mosqueda, and it's a new statement of legislative intent requiring SPD to report on specific activity of officers that serve on a number of inner jurisdictional task forces, officers regularly serve on inner jurisdictional task forces with various departments of the Federal Government.",104,,
511,0.97,3620.95,3628.658,And this particular sly would ask for more detail on what they do as part of those Interjurisdictional task forces.,104,,
512,0.97,3628.658,3636.733,The officers also typically receive reimbursement for participation on those task forces.,104,,
513,0.97,3636.733,3654.817,And this particular sly would have a statement of intent that would say that Council would like to find out more about these task forces and would seek community input on the activities of these task forces before determining whether to provide ongoing reimbursement for the activities.,104,,
514,0.97,3654.817,3657.286,Brought to you by Councilmember Mosqueda.,104,,
515,0.97,3657.286,3657.72,Thank you Greg.,105,,
516,0.97,3657.72,3668.698,"For as long as I've been on Council, I know there's been Council colleagues trying to get a better understanding of the role city officials have on these various task forces.",105,,
517,0.97,3668.698,3687.85,"Thank you to Councilmember Herbold, Council President Gonzales and others who have been raising questions just about how we are--what activities SPD is performing under these programs and the task force--and the various task forces so the sly is really intended to gain greater clarity before we receive those requests.",105,,
518,0.97,3687.85,3691.487,Thank you so much.,105,,
519,0.97,3697.693,3703.566,"Item 188, SPR 10C 1 sponsored by Councilmember Strauss.",105,,
520,0.97,3703.566,3714.677,"It would add $1 million to Seattle parks and recreation for park remediation work at the 900,000-Dollar level in planning for a new dog park at the 100,000-Dollar level.",105,,
521,0.97,3714.677,3720.116,This revised amendment adds a total of $1 million in reach to SPR.,105,,
522,0.97,3720.116,3735.765,"As I said, a larger increment would fund park remediation work and $100,000 would provide funding for a new dog park in Ballard's leery Triangle area.",105,,
523,0.97,3736.432,3738.0,Thank you very much.,105,,
524,0.97,3738.0,3741.07,Let's talk parks and dogs.,105,,
525,0.97,3741.07,3741.604,Councilmember Strauss.,105,,
526,0.97,3741.604,3743.706,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,106,,
527,0.97,3743.706,3744.474,And thank you.,106,,
528,0.97,3744.474,3749.812,I may have inadvertently made a mistake as we've been moving quickly in the budget process.,106,,
529,0.97,3749.812,3767.396,"When the dog park amendment did not pass, did not make it in the budget balancing package, and I understand all of the things that you're weighing, we did still want to make sure there was remediation and or planning improvement dollars available for the leery Triangle.",106,,
530,0.97,3767.396,3771.434,Leery Triangle is an interesting piece of park property owned by Sdot.,106,,
531,0.97,3771.434,3772.935,It's in our right of way.,106,,
532,0.97,3772.935,3776.506,However it functions as a Park- like setting.,106,,
533,0.97,3776.506,3781.978,So my worry here is that the remediation dollars would not be able to be be used at this location.,106,,
534,0.97,3781.978,3784.413,Because it's not a park.,106,,
535,0.97,3784.413,3785.148,It's technically Sdot.,106,,
536,0.97,3785.148,3793.256,So I just wanted to make sure that we had dollars to be able to spend to continue moving the community's efforts forward.,106,,
537,0.97,3793.256,3798.127,The community has been working to make capital improvements to this area.,106,,
538,0.97,3798.127,3801.731,Including closing ninth Avenue Northwest to make that more of a public space.,106,,
539,0.97,3801.731,3805.535,They've been working on this for six years.,106,,
540,0.97,3805.535,3811.274,Dog park seems to be their--what they are rallying around.,106,,
541,0.97,3811.274,3816.045,I think there's other options to include a food truck corral and possibly a skate spot.,106,,
542,0.97,3816.045,3819.782,A lot of options on the table.,106,,
543,0.97,3819.782,3821.651,"This 100,000-Dollars would just keep that moving.",106,,
544,0.97,3821.651,3823.286,Thank you chair.,106,,
545,0.97,3823.286,3829.959,Thank you Councilmember Strauss and the last item in the group B package.,107,,
546,0.97,3829.959,3832.461,Spr 12 B 1 sponsored by Councilmember Strauss.,108,,
547,0.97,3832.461,3839.835,This would request that Seattle parks and recreation report on the potential expansion of the Seattle conservation core.,108,,
548,0.97,3839.835,3845.074,A previous option of the amendment provided a position and funding to help grow the Seattle conservation core.,108,,
549,0.97,3845.074,3852.081,This item is a statement of Legisative intent requesting that SPR provide a report on that program.,108,,
550,0.97,3852.081,3857.32,It lists several specific reporting dimensions.,108,,
551,0.97,3857.32,3863.392,Asking for information about the current state of the program and potential opportunities if additional funding were available.,108,,
552,0.97,3863.392,3864.393,Excellent Councilmember Strauss.,109,,
553,0.97,3864.393,3871.834,"Thank you chair, thank you Anne, very well said, the previous Iteration of this request was to add staff and request a report.",110,,
554,0.97,3871.834,3874.036,This Iteration is just requesting the report.,110,,
555,0.97,3874.036,3892.355,"We know that the Seattle conservation core is a proven program that Seattle operates that meets people leaving homelessness or Incarceration, gives them the job case management they need to find a permanent job and find success in life.",110,,
556,0.97,3892.355,3896.759,This Seattle conservation core gives people a paycheck.,110,,
557,0.97,3896.759,3900.296,Gives them meaningful work and the support they need to be successful.,110,,
558,0.97,3900.296,3902.031,So I do want to expand it.,110,,
559,0.97,3902.031,3904.0,I wanted to double the program this year.,110,,
560,0.97,3904.0,3904.967,They weren't ready for it.,110,,
561,0.97,3904.967,3912.675,"So Oim asking for a report to structure the next year's work to get us to a place of expansion, thank you chair.",110,,
562,0.97,3913.175,3916.078,Thank you very Moch Councilmember Strauss.,111,,
563,0.97,3916.078,3921.584,"And colleagues, I think that reaches the end of group B. I want to thank central staff for working through that.",111,,
564,0.97,3921.584,3926.622,I see Councilmember Herbold with the first comment to provide general comments on our package.,111,,
565,0.97,3926.622,3928.124,I think Councilmember Herbold --,111,,
566,0.97,3928.124,3930.293,"I have a question, I'm sorry.",112,,
567,0.97,3930.293,3936.565,"Yeah, please, in terms of process.",113,,
568,0.97,3936.565,3940.169,I'm going to ask colleagues to remove items they'd like to see from group B first.,113,,
569,0.97,3940.169,3941.804,We'll put those to the side.,113,,
570,0.97,3941.804,3945.274,We'll then have a conversation about the entire package as amended.,113,,
571,0.97,3945.274,3946.876,Group B as amended.,113,,
572,0.97,3946.876,3951.58,We'll consider group B as amended and then go into the individual ones that have been pulled.,113,,
573,0.97,3951.58,3953.049,Please go ahead Councilmember Herbold.,113,,
574,0.97,3953.049,3956.152,I have a question.,114,,
575,0.97,3956.152,3958.921,I'm not speaking about the over all group B right now.,114,,
576,0.97,3958.921,3963.693,I should have asked the question when we were on 187.,114,,
577,0.97,3963.693,3966.195,But this was a new item for me.,114,,
578,0.97,3966.195,3969.598,And I hadn't seen it.,114,,
579,0.97,3969.598,3992.421,"How does this affect the current--for 2021, for this year, the grant authorization legislation for SPD that would provide reimbursement for some grant activities that have all ready occurred?",114,,
580,0.97,3992.421,4007.169,And some of those activities I believe we are--we act a a pass through agency so other jurisdictions that we're in partnership with might be waiting on us for funds.,114,,
581,0.97,4007.169,4015.177,And I also just want to flag that the report date is February 2021.,114,,
582,0.97,4015.177,4017.88,So that further added to my confusion.,114,,
583,0.97,4017.88,4018.781,Thank you so much.,114,,
584,0.97,4018.781,4030.025,"Let me ask the question Procedurally, I'm happy to have questions answered and addressed before Councilmember makes a decision to remove the item Procedurally.",114,,
585,0.97,4030.025,4042.705,"I want to confirm with the clerk I'm allowed to have Councilmembers ask questions and if they decide they would like to remove it, then we can make those decisions, as part of our consideration with group B, that's permanent here.",114,,
586,0.97,4042.705,4045.408,"Correct, it's at the chair's discretion.",115,,
587,0.97,4045.408,4046.242,"Okay, let's do this.",116,,
588,0.97,4046.242,4049.311,We have question on the table here.,116,,
589,0.97,4049.311,4051.28,I'm hoping Greg Doss can answer the question.,116,,
590,0.97,4051.28,4075.037,"If we need to make a verbal amendment to the date, we may want to pull this one out any ways, council central staff, is there any additional feedback that you have on Councilmember Herbold's question about the impact on grant recipients who we serve as a pass through for.",116,,
591,0.97,4075.037,4077.139,Happy to provide context there.,116,,
592,0.97,4077.139,4078.207,It should be 2022 staff.,116,,
593,0.97,4078.207,4080.176,I checked the wrong box in the system.,116,,
594,0.97,4080.176,4082.445,And I've all ready corrected that in the system.,116,,
595,0.97,4082.445,4090.152,I don't know as to who that needs to be corrected officially with a verbal amendment.,116,,
596,0.97,4090.152,4094.09,I would ask Allie to speak to that when I'm done here.,116,,
597,0.97,4094.09,4112.675,"But as far as the year end supplemental and the acceptance of grants and task forces for SPD, the year end supplemental contains about $500,000 worth of task force reimbursements for SPD for the year 2021 for this year.",116,,
598,0.97,4112.675,4121.784,And what is happening there is SPD has put in for reimbursement for money that it has all ready received from the Federal Government for the task force that it has worked on.,116,,
599,0.97,4121.784,4140.703,So it is the case that if the Council does not provide the appropriation authority for the activities and the work that s people's exhibit PD has all ready done.,116,,
600,0.97,4140.703,4144.473,Then SPD is in the hole.,116,,
601,0.97,4144.473,4170.399,"So this particular sly is designed to tell the Department that next year, before they start charging funding--start charging money to the Feds and just assuming that they're going to get reimbursement from the Council, they should come to the Council first and describe what they're doing but in terms of this year, all the reimbursement funds are provided for in the mid year supplemental.",116,,
602,0.97,4170.399,4177.373,"Knowing if they weren't, it would mean a 500,000-Dollar hole to SPD's budget for 2021.",116,,
603,0.97,4177.373,4193.322,"In terms of the grant Funning, all the grant funding for all the major grants, all the Federal grants, Internet crimes against children or the homeland security grants.",116,,
604,0.97,4193.322,4201.263,All of the grants are accepted in the mid year supplemental.,116,,
605,0.97,4201.263,4205.734,They're all appropriated with the exception of one $3.2 million grant.,116,,
606,0.97,4205.734,4212.942,That's the grant that allows the Department to spend Federal Funning on equipment of its choice.,116,,
607,0.97,4212.942,4227.089,"And that is the grant that last year, the Council wanted to see the specific equipment list for the grant and how the Department Wu going to spend its money.",116,,
608,0.97,4227.089,4228.991,This year working through the chair.,116,,
609,0.97,4228.991,4230.192,And the public safety chair.,116,,
610,0.97,4230.192,4235.764,"The other grants, all of the other grants are included in the supplemental.",116,,
611,0.97,4235.764,4253.248,"Except for that one $3.2 million grant which will not be included and can be handled separately at the beginning of next year since it's a multi- year grant, and what I mean by multi-year is it runs on the Federal fiscal year.",116,,
612,0.97,4253.248,4257.186,From okay October to October.,116,,
613,0.97,4257.186,4262.925,"It's multi-year for us at the city, it can be appropriated in January.",116,,
614,0.97,4262.925,4266.729,And the Department can spend money in 2022.,116,,
615,0.97,4266.729,4276.705,And so that's the approach that's being taken with the grants and the task forces.,116,,
616,0.97,4276.705,4280.409,I just want to thank Greg for that.,117,,
617,0.97,4280.409,4289.618,"That tracks with my understanding of previous conversations that we've had with just one--I want to just--again, I want to really make sure I'm tracking this.",117,,
618,0.97,4289.618,4297.159,I thought I heard you say the grant acceptance ordinances had all ready moved forward with the mid year supplemental.,117,,
619,0.97,4297.159,4302.064,Did you mean the third quarter supplemental in,117,,
620,0.97,4302.064,4302.531,We did.,118,,
621,0.97,4302.531,4307.136,I don't the we acted on the grant acceptance ordinance in August.,118,,
622,0.97,4307.136,4309.038,And here's Allie.,119,,
623,0.97,4309.038,4313.542,"Councilmember Herbold, the year end--so we don't do a third quarter--Yeah.",120,,
624,0.97,4313.542,4323.585,The year end supplemental grant acceptance ordinance and the year end supplemental budget ordinance is in group a so you all ready acted on that.,120,,
625,0.97,4323.585,4324.186,Aha.,121,,
626,0.97,4324.186,4324.486,All right.,121,,
627,0.97,4324.486,4324.753,Perfect.,121,,
628,0.97,4324.753,4325.788,Thank you so much.,121,,
629,0.97,4325.788,4354.55,"And then I would NOTE too in terms of the due date for the statement of legislative intent, if it's incorrect in the version posted on the agenda, you could make a verbal amendment because the committee structure will change in, you know, February or March t Council will adopt a resolution for the statements of legislative intent and we will adjust the committee assignments, if the committee structure changes in 2022 as well as adjust due dates Aftertalk with the executive about what's possible.",121,,
630,0.97,4354.55,4358.954,So it's not technically necessary.,121,,
631,0.97,4358.954,4359.455,To make the correction.,121,,
632,0.97,4359.455,4364.86,But that really is up to the sponsor and the committee.,121,,
633,0.97,4364.86,4367.396,I also appreciate all the work that you've done.,121,,

659,0.97,4466.528,4479.508,I'm wondering do we need to make changes in the budget language to allow for remediation of the leery Triangle that could include a dog park.,129,,
660,0.97,4479.508,4480.809,But not limited to.,129,,
661,0.97,4480.809,4486.782,Differ to central staff on who we need to offer a verbal amendment on that.,130,,

663,0.97,4493.222,4503.565,And I'm not deep in the details on what this means but that sounds like a slightly different proposal than what this is.,131,,
664,0.97,4503.565,4517.88,"And so yes, if that's what you intend is to just have a million dollars for park remediation work that could improve the leery Triangle that's different than what this action is.",131,,

670,0.97,4526.788,4532.427,"I think there was just a technical--during the Údrafting, there was a Technica mistake.",131,,
671,0.97,4532.427,4549.845,"Councilmember Strauss, I'm going to Scught that we do go ahead and remove item 188 and perhaps as we consider these other items that have been removed, if you want to work on a verbal amendment to that with central staff, I think that would be the cleanest way.",132,,
672,0.97,4549.845,4552.981,Would you like to make a motion to remove item 188.,132,,
673,0.97,4552.981,4560.122,"Yes, I would like to remove item 188.",133,,

678,0.97,4573.402,4588.483,Or would you like us to remove the item 187 for a verbal amendment to strike 2001 and replace in 2022.,133,,

697,0.97,4630.058,4634.596,"If we want to make your lives easier, what's cleanest for central staff?",139,,
698,0.97,4634.596,4641.169,That would be to make a verbal amendment or just to hold it until the resolution in the spring and not have to bring it back on Monday.,140,,
699,0.97,4641.169,4648.844,"So if you'd like it to be clean as voting out of the budget, I would suggest you remove it and I can talk you through a verbal amendment to make that correction.",140,,

1009,0.97,5600.828,5610.671,"And though we chartered the PDA, there was no initial funding provided to the Organization for acquisition for capital projects.",295,,
1010,0.97,5610.671,5613.908,So that's what we're trying to amend here.,295,,
1011,0.97,5613.908,5620.281,"As Asha mentioned, this would use out year funding for the Salvation Army.",295,,
1012,0.97,5620.281,5633.494,And we are trying to keep with the intent of the chair to make sure that we're shifting out year funding to things that are needed in 2022.,295,,
1013,0.97,5633.494,5649.043,"So by right SIZING this proposal, we can dedicate 1.1 million Clipper funds to this PDA and continue to provide resources for the shelter through the beginning of 2023.",295,,
1014,0.97,5649.443,5655.616,"Thank you, are there any additional comments or questions?",296,,
1015,0.97,5655.616,5658.185,"Yes, please go ahead, Councilmember Herbold.",296,,
1016,0.97,5658.185,5679.607,"Thank you, I appreciate the effort to focus funds that we have now that could be used in 2023 because Clipper as a fund source permits it to try to focus the use of the resources on our needs now.",297,,
1017,0.97,5679.607,5702.43,"But I feel like that goal that we have of using funds for needs now are--that goal is really related to, for me at least, to funding needs associated with either Covid or with like just, you know, human needs.",297,,
1018,0.97,5702.43,5704.832,That are going lacking right now.,297,,
1019,0.97,5704.832,5716.477,"I'm, you know, really excited about the cultural space agency PDA worked on it myself when I was committee chair of the committee with over sight of arts.",297,,
1020,0.97,5716.477,5728.789,I'm just really concerned with this item and the other two items that would cut the entire 5 million funds for 2023 Soto shelter operations.,297,,
1021,0.97,5728.789,5740.067,I appreciate the chair has made commitments that if there isn't another source of funds for 2023 that you would work to find those funds.,297,,
1022,0.97,5740.067,5754.782,"And what we know about one, the fact that there are unlikely to be future Federal funds and two, that we maybe looking at some tough budget years starting next year.",297,,
1023,0.97,5754.782,5756.15,Or continuing next year.,297,,
1024,0.97,5756.15,5771.432,I just wouldn't want to take an action that assumes that we're going to be able to find another $5 million for the needs of the Soto salvation Army shelter.,297,,
1025,0.97,5772.867,5776.036,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,297,,
1026,0.97,5776.036,5781.509,I will also add some comments along a similar vain.,297,,
1027,0.97,5781.509,5784.945,"Councilmember Morales, I want to thank you for the work you've done in this effort.",297,,
1028,0.97,5784.945,5799.293,You and the vice chair just spoke very much working to make sure that there was investments in arts and culture in our ill literal illiteracy rescue plan.,297,,
1029,0.97,5799.293,5801.562,I want to thank you for that work.,297,,
1030,0.97,5801.562,5818.245,"I also will have to Unfortunately note that among the various priorities that we're considering right now, making sure that folks have stable shelter, even in 2023 when we're hoping that we're going to be in better years, it's still a big priority here.",297,,
1031,0.97,5818.245,5822.149,I would love to seed a PDA to support arts ask culture.,297,,
1032,0.97,5822.149,5827.221,And I lock forward to additional conversations for how to secure revenue to accomplish that.,297,,
1033,0.97,5827.221,5834.495,"But for today, unfortunately, I love the concept but I think it's a matter of tough choices.",297,,
1034,0.97,5834.495,5838.199,"Councilmembers, any additional comments before Councilmember Morales wraps this up.",297,,

1117,0.97,6067.528,6072.433,This amendment is not related to the funding piece associated with hiring bonuses.,345,,
1118,0.97,6072.433,6077.037,It's only related to the emergency order that the Mayor issued.,345,,
1119,0.97,6077.037,6087.481,And what this item does is it AMENDS the mayors executive order regarding bonuses for both police officers and 911 dispatch hires.,345,,
1120,0.97,6087.481,6095.556,It AMENDS the order on these hiring incentives to limit the duration of the emergency order through the end of 2021.,345,,
1121,0.97,6095.556,6100.127,So allowing the emergency order to continue as drafted.,345,,
1122,0.97,6100.127,6104.431,And issued by the Mayor through the end of 2021.,345,,
1123,0.97,6104.431,6109.803,"It does limit expenditures pursuant to the order to $500,000.",345,,
1124,0.97,6109.803,6117.578,This is the amount the Mayor's office estimates would be needed in 2021.,345,,
1125,0.97,6117.578,6149.376,"And so the concept being that in the chair's balancing package, Councilmember Mosqueda has sponsored a request for a report from the budget office to the Council on a potential city wide hiring incentive for city workers in recognition of what I think you've heard me say many, many, many times is that we have a lot of vacancies, and a lot of departments throughout the city.",346,,
1126,0.97,6149.376,6153.413,And some real challenges in several departments in filling those vacancies.,346,,
1127,0.97,6153.413,6166.26,And so this proposal allows for hiring bonuses to continue though the end of the year for both SPD and 911 Dispatchers.,346,,
1128,0.97,6166.26,6184.611,But holds the continuation of the executive order in 2022 pending this report as Referenced in the chair's balancing package item agenda item 8. thank you.,346,,

1131,0.97,6189.75,6195.455,I want to thank public safety chair for bringing this modification of the Mayor's emergency order forward.,348,,
1132,0.97,6195.455,6208.835,I want to thank Council President who got the ball rolling and central staff who did some analysis of the emergency order I think the proposed modifications are reasonable and fiscally prudent.,348,,
1133,0.97,6208.835,6222.115,"Considering the fact that 300 officers have left the police Department all ready, I do support some form of hiring incentive, such as those originally proposed in the Mayor's budget of 2022.",348,,
1134,0.97,6222.115,6228.722,There are a couple amendments in our budget committee agenda that could remain more modest hiring incentives.,348,,
1135,0.97,6228.722,6232.726,I would need to see what happens with those before I act on this.,348,,
1136,0.97,6232.726,6235.562,I'll be ready to vote on this on Monday.,348,,
1137,0.97,6235.562,6240.4,"I'm leaning toward it for sure, but I'll be abstaining in this vote.",348,,
1138,0.97,6240.4,6244.271,But know what happens to the other hiring incentives.,348,,
1139,0.97,6244.271,6244.838,Thank you.,348,,
1140,0.97,6244.838,6246.106,Any additional comments.,348,,
1141,0.97,6246.106,6250.377,"Councilmember Strauss, excuse me, did I hear somebody else?",348,,
1142,0.97,6250.377,6253.347,"Councilmember Strauss, Okay, Councilmember Juarez, Councilmember Strauss.",348,,
1143,0.97,6253.347,6254.915,Councilmember Juarez can go first.,349,,

1145,0.97,6257.918,6258.418,Thank you.,350,,
1146,0.97,6258.418,6259.786,"Yes, Ma'am.",351,,
1147,0.97,6259.786,6264.091,I am going to take the same tact as Councilmember Pedersen.,352,,
1148,0.97,6264.091,6276.336,I'm concerned about or have some comments in what's going to happen with when we're looking at numbers 201 and 202.,352,,
1149,0.97,6276.336,6286.947,For the modification for the--how it affects item 191 for the order issues October 29th.,352,,
1150,0.97,6286.947,6290.484,Which I think it means it's been effect for about 18 days.,352,,
1151,0.97,6290.484,6307.401,"And also I don't have any information, maybe you do if you have some to share Councilmember Herbold of what in fact--I don't know the update or status about how that's been implemented as far as the incentives and hiring in the last 18 days.",352,,
1152,0.97,6307.401,6309.569,I don't have any information.,352,,
1153,0.97,6309.569,6313.507,That's precisely why this action allows it to stay in place.,353,,
1154,0.97,6313.507,6314.274,Because it's working.,353,,
1155,0.97,6314.274,6321.281,"And you know, as it relates specifically, they've seen three times as many applicants since it was announced.",353,,
1156,0.97,6321.281,6324.184,So this action leaves the emergency order in place.,353,,
1157,0.97,6324.184,6326.486,Through the end of the year.,353,,
1158,0.97,6326.486,6330.424,But it assumes that we might want to make changes for 2022.,353,,
1159,0.97,6330.424,6331.558,Okay.,353,,
1160,0.97,6331.558,6333.66,"Well, thank you for that quick reply.",353,,
1161,0.97,6333.66,6334.428,But I'll still abstain.,353,,

1177,0.97,6391.551,6402.062,So I needed to go to urgent care this morning and I also will not be able to speak extensively to explain my vote than I normally would until I get more healthy.,357,,
1178,0.97,6402.062,6408.402,"But I wanted to let member of the public know if they want more information about my vote, they should feel free to contact my staff.",357,,
1179,0.97,6408.402,6421.014,Ly be voting no on this item because it's a resolution that APPROVES the Mayor's emergency order from October to create hiring bonuses for police officers.,357,,
1180,0.97,6421.014,6423.65,I have a resolution that will do the opposite.,357,,
1181,0.97,6423.65,6425.118,Thank you.,357,,
1182,0.97,6425.352,6427.788,Thank you very much.,358,,
1183,0.97,6427.788,6430.09,Any additional comments or questions?,358,,
1184,0.97,6430.09,6431.892,Get better Councilmember Sawant.,359,,
1185,0.97,6431.892,6433.693,"Yes, thank you Councilmember Sawant for dialing in.",360,,
1186,0.97,6433.693,6436.229,I do hope you feel better as well.,360,,
1187,0.97,6440.033,6440.934,S Councilmember Herbold.,360,,
1188,0.97,6440.934,6442.803,You have the last word.,360,,
1189,0.97,6442.803,6443.77,Please go ahead.,360,,
1190,0.97,6443.77,6448.408,I appreciate hearing from Councilmembers who are planning on abstaining.,361,,
1191,0.97,6448.408,6461.988,I want to emphasize that while we do have some pending discussion around the funding for an incentive program.,361,,
1192,0.97,6461.988,6464.858,This is a stand alone action separate from that conversation.,361,,
1193,0.97,6464.858,6479.439,S the only about the extension--this is only about the amendment of the existing executive emergency executive order and as we heard from Councilmember Sawant.,361,,
1194,0.97,6479.439,6487.714,She has another version on Monday that we'll be considering.,361,,
1195,0.97,6487.714,6490.917,And as she characterizes it's a competing amendment.,361,,
1196,0.97,6490.917,6512.839,"I would like to settle the question for once and for all here within the budget deliberations on how it is we are going to either accept, amend, or reject the Mayor's executive order as it stands for the rest of this year.",361,,
1197,0.97,6512.839,6514.507,So thank you.,361,,
1198,0.97,6514.875,6517.244,Thank you very much.,362,,
1199,0.97,6517.244,6519.846,"Council Madame chair, may I respond.",363,,
1200,0.97,6519.846,6522.782,"Yes, please go ahead.",364,,
1201,0.97,6522.782,6523.55,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,364,,
1202,0.97,6523.55,6524.818,I guess my point was this.,364,,
1203,0.97,6524.818,6529.389,Originally I was just going to say no.,364,,
1204,0.97,6529.389,6540.133,"Because I felt that this wasn't modifying the civil emergency order during budget for me any way, I can't speak for anyone else.",364,,
1205,0.97,6540.133,6544.571,It just didn't seem like the appropriate time to get more information as it was coming in.,364,,
1206,0.97,6544.571,6551.578,I do know that they had as you say an influx of more people for the 911 positions.,364,,
1207,0.97,6551.578,6559.719,"But I wanted to explore more, first of all, what we're hearing from the new administration, and also just how we were going to look at these other amendments that are coming up.",364,,
1208,0.97,6559.719,6562.022,So I do appreciate the work you put in.,364,,
1209,0.97,6562.022,6564.824,And I do understand what you're doing.,364,,
1210,0.97,6564.824,6568.395,So that was my--that was my original intent.,364,,
1211,0.97,6568.395,6570.931,So thank you.,364,,
1212,0.97,6571.865,6573.3,"Okay, Councilmember Herbold.",365,,
1213,0.97,6573.3,6576.469,We need to keep moving on.,365,,
1214,0.97,6576.469,6603.83,"I want to explain why I bring it up during budget is because it's connected to Council, Madame chair's amendment about a potential 2022 incentive program that might continue to help the departments under the current version or might add new departments.",366,,
1215,0.97,6603.83,6620.28,"And so I have been saying, I think pretty consistently through the budget process and through the--when we received questions about who we're going to propose changes to the executive order.",366,,
1216,0.97,6620.28,6627.954,"I've been saying I believe because the executive order could go into 2022, I believe very firmly that this is a budget issue.",366,,
1217,0.97,6627.954,6657.584,"And that because we don't know what the impacts are for 2022, that this Council should consider through a statement of legislative intent a--sort of a work plan item for the executive to look at other departments, and the needs of other departments and then to bring back to us a recommendation for a city wide bonus program to assist other departments in 2022.",366,,
1218,0.97,6657.584,6658.018,Thank you.,366,,
1219,0.97,6658.451,6660.387,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,367,,
1220,0.97,6660.387,6664.424,I think this is a tough conversation to have.,367,,
1221,0.97,6664.424,6668.294,Absent knowing where the Councilmembers stand on the existing executive order.,367,,
1222,0.97,6668.294,6673.433,I do appreciate the work that you and I have done to identify what information is needed.,367,,
1223,0.97,6673.433,6686.88,There's a sly included in our proposal here that requests the city budget officer report on the city wide hiring incentive program and that report should include an analysis for the need for city wide hiring incentives.,367,,
1224,0.97,6686.88,6691.317,Make sure we get recommendations on strategies for suggesting difficulties in hiring.,367,,
1225,0.97,6691.317,6700.827,Including but not limited to hiring bonuses and include a raise in the social justice impacts.,367,,
1226,0.97,6700.827,6707.867,This is not something that should be a blanket authority for next administration in 2022 to solely decide.,367,,
1227,0.97,6707.867,6716.676,And I think it requires a larger policy conversation the me today I'm going to hold off on voting yes on this because I am interested in getting that report back.,367,,
1228,0.97,6716.676,6728.188,I also don't want to have a policy signal of support for the existing Propoe proposal for hiring bonuses when we've heard from front line folks.,367,,
1229,0.97,6728.188,6731.224,They're not interested in this incentive.,367,,
1230,0.97,6731.224,6734.36,"For me, I see your hand, I'm sorry I didn't see you before.",367,,
1231,0.97,6734.36,6739.132,I raised it when you started speaking.,368,,
1232,0.97,6739.132,6744.137,No need to apologize.,368,,
1233,0.97,6744.137,6777.437,"Just Procedurally for people, this has been put on the table here, I want to make really clear that should Councilmember Herbold's proposed budget action that we're debating right now pass, then advancing the resolution as proposed by Councilmember Herbold out of committee today would effectively Supersede the resolution that Councilmember Sawant flagged in her comments and that was introduced a couple Mondays ago.",368,,
1234,0.97,6777.437,6800.727,"So just want to make really clear from a procedural perspective that if Councilmember Herbold's resolution, you know, appears on the city council agenda, that would Supersede the aforementioned resolution that was first put on the table by Councilmember Sawant.",368,,
1235,0.97,6801.394,6804.631,Thank you Council President.,369,,
1236,0.97,6804.631,6820.446,"Madame clerk, could you please call the role on the adoption of Cvo--on Cvo 512A 001 as amended by Councilmember Herbold.",369,,

1268,0.97,6915.875,6919.979,Cutting $1 million and one time funding for an emergency shelter.,386,,
1269,0.97,6921.314,6931.524,This differs from the previously introduced version which was not in the balancing package that would have provided $4.5 million.,386,,
1270,0.97,6931.524,6936.596,Not only the 1 million to acquire and do work on the land.,386,,
1271,0.97,6936.596,6943.703,But 3 ppt $3 million for the site improvements as well as funding for initial operations in the first year.,386,,

1274,0.97,6952.412,6957.717,Where the second year of funding for this program would be reduced.,386,,
1275,0.97,6957.717,6963.056,So that the program wouldn't be able to operate for the full calendar year of 2023.,386,,

1280,0.97,6976.502,6979.739,It's because 192 is at the top of group D now.,388,,

1329,0.97,7171.831,7174.867,Would you like to describe the amendment.,400,,
1330,0.97,7174.867,7176.802,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,401,,
1331,0.97,7176.802,7182.508,I want to thank staff for their assistance in crafting the statement of legislative intent.,401,,
1332,0.97,7182.508,7185.811,It requests two reports from Seattle city light to the city council.,401,,
1333,0.97,7185.811,7189.782,And it's about two different capital projects.,401,,
1334,0.97,7189.782,7192.418,With the recent wind storms.,401,,
1335,0.97,7192.418,7196.489,They occurred after we had all ready submitted a bunch of budget amendments.,401,,
1336,0.97,7196.489,7208.434,And the wind storms were a reminder about the need to focus on replacing utility poles that are aging before they fall down.,401,,
1337,0.97,7208.434,7221.647,"And so this request, a progress report on the status of city light's plans and results to replace and or upgrade the system of utility poles throughout Seattle with a separate analysis of the poles on East marginal way.",401,,
1338,0.97,7221.647,7225.551,This would include recommendations for expediting the replacement of those poles.,401,,
1339,0.97,7225.551,7242.435,"The second report is about a line item in the capital budget to add $8 million for office space and so on its face, it would seem that replacing utility poles would be more important than that.",401,,
1340,0.97,7242.435,7248.774,There are however some financial savings in the long run by reducing leasing costs to Seattle city light.,401,,
1341,0.97,7248.774,7261.954,So we want to get these reports at the same time so we can do a deeper dive on this issue and look at whether we need to accelerate the replacement of those utility poles.,401,,

1345,0.97,7275.835,7290.283,I appreciate the work you've done to follow up with city light since October 2019 audit that we had put forward in the conversation that we've been having about the number of light poles that were failing.,401,,
1346,0.97,7290.283,7292.284,Especially on East marginal way.,401,,
1347,0.97,7292.284,7298.958,"I appreciate the consultants, and recommendation on how to mitigate the risk of light pole failure in the future.",401,,
1348,0.97,7298.958,7306.265,So I'll support this as a timely progress report towards the pole replacement efforts across the city.,401,,

1375,0.97,7346.605,7350.376,The motion carries.,422,,
1376,0.97,7350.376,7352.645,And amendment number 196 passes.,422,,
1377,0.97,7352.645,7352.945,All right.,422,,
1378,0.97,7352.945,7355.314,We are on to item 197.,422,,
1379,0.97,7356.349,7366.559,Item 197 is,423,,
1380,0.97,7374.4,7378.604,Councilmember Peterson would you like to move this item?,424,,
1381,0.97,7378.604,7379.238,I do.,425,,
1382,0.97,7379.238,7392.118,"I would like to move item, it is a Sli.",425,,
1383,0.97,7400.092,7401.761,It has been moved and Seconded.,426,,
1384,0.97,7401.761,7403.662,Councilmember Peterson would you like to speak to your amendment?,426,,
1385,0.97,7403.662,7404.263,Thank you.,427,,
1386,0.97,7404.263,7406.065,This is a Sli that I put forward earlier.,427,,
1387,0.97,7406.065,7409.001,It is to determine estimated impacts to our city's infrastructure from overweight vehicles.,427,,
1388,0.97,7409.001,7410.035,This is a no cost fly.,427,,
1389,0.97,7410.035,7426.585,As discussed previously it would include studying damage to Seattle streets by construction vehicles and others that seek exemptions to weight limits designed to maintain the useful life of our investments.,427,,
1390,0.97,7426.585,7438.798,This request came up during discussion as a plan but it was decided this would be more of appropriate for a budget of legislative intent.,427,,
1391,0.97,7438.798,7453.612,Understanding the damage by overweight vehicles and the cost to repair the streets will help to improve asset management planning and budgeting and could yield creative and cost-effective solutions to minimize such damage from some overweight vehicles in the future.,427,,
1392,0.97,7453.612,7455.614,I hope you can support this Sli.,427,,
1393,0.97,7455.614,7457.917,Thank you.,427,,
1394,0.97,7457.917,7472.198,Councilmember Peterson are there any additional comments or questions?,428,,
1395,0.97,7472.198,7475.901,"Councilmember Peterson, I am going to let you know that I do still have concerns on this item.",428,,
1396,0.97,7475.901,7493.152,We have heard from some of our regional partners about whether this could be addressed outside the budget.,428,,
1397,0.97,7493.152,7497.857,They would like to get a report from Sdot to look at the transportation committee without this being tied to a budget action.,428,,
1398,0.97,7497.857,7502.761,"I understand it is just a Sli and I understand that if there is support, I will be a no on this one.",428,,
1399,0.97,7502.761,7505.064,Please go ahead Councilmember her bold.,428,,
1400,0.97,7505.064,7515.274,I appreciate Councilmember Peterson bringing this forward as a Sli because there is a previous request that it not be dealt with with in the comprehensive plan discussions.,429,,
1401,0.97,7515.274,7532.324,"So, I am concerned continuing to say don't bring it up this way or this way, it will just result in us not getting the information and I have areas in my district and I'm sure others do throughout the city where heavy vehicles are a real issue.",429,,
1402,0.97,7532.324,7565.891,And I think that getting this information could be helpful in a number of different ways whether or not it is getting partnership from other jurisdictions to maintain our streets as well as limiting the use of our streets inappropriately in areas like Southpark where we see so many large freight vehicles going through residential neighborhoods.,429,,
1403,0.97,7565.891,7575.968,And as Councilmember Peterson says really messing up the streets and also creating safety issues as well for the community.,429,,
1404,0.97,7575.968,7577.036,Thank you vice chair.,430,,
1405,0.97,7577.036,7580.739,Any additional comments or questions?,430,,
1406,0.97,7580.739,7580.973,Okay.,430,,

1427,0.97,7615.441,7617.276,Congratulations Councilmember Peterson with flying colors that passed.,450,,
1428,0.97,7617.276,7624.85,You do have the adoption of 197.,450,,
1429,0.97,7624.85,7628.387,Let's move on to 198.,450,,
1430,0.97,7628.387,7635.928,198 is cutting 2.4 million general fund from the center city streetcar project.,451,,
1431,0.97,7635.928,7645.671,"It would direct 400,000 to the Department of early education learning for bus routing technology and $2 million for citywide hiring incentive program.",451,,
1432,0.97,7645.671,7648.907,It is offered by Council members Herbold and Peterson.,451,,
1433,0.97,7648.907,7656.415,"Thank you Council member Herbold, would you like to move the item in front of us?",452,,
1434,0.97,7656.415,7666.592,I move CBA Sdot dash 107 dash a dash 001.,453,,
1435,0.97,7666.592,7679.071,As we discussed today and in previous budget meetings I think there is agreement that hiring and retention of city staff are important issues.,454,,
1436,0.97,7679.071,7732.391,"There have been special attention to the question of hiring and retention of Seattle police Department with the mayors initial recommendation for citywide hiring incentive program and adding the mayors second proposal for a hiring incentive program with the emergency order, I have been arguing that we really need to do an analysis of issues among front-line workers specifically focus on those that are causing a service issue or inhibiting a department from filling a function as well as recommendations on varied strategies to address difficulties in hiring including but not limited to hiring bonuses.",454,,
1437,0.97,7732.391,7739.164,Coupled with a racial and social justice analysis on the impacts of the recommendation regarding a citywide hiring incentive program.,454,,
1438,0.97,7739.164,7762.02,"So, this action would put some funds and put those funds aside because the chairs balancing package does not include those funds for a subsequent 2022 action to support a potential citywide hiring incentive program.",454,,
1439,0.97,7762.02,7779.605,"Again, my original budget action preserved $1.09 million, moved it out of SPD and moved it into Finance general to support a 2022 hiring bonus incentive.",454,,
1440,0.97,7779.605,7787.379,That is not in the balancing area so am proposing to fund this program otherwise.,454,,
1441,0.97,7787.379,7791.383,This would provide $2 million in funding for citywide hiring bonus plan.,454,,
1442,0.97,7791.383,7810.569,"The Mayor's proposed budget did not include sufficient funding for hiring bonuses for 911 Dispatchers, because after the budget was already proposed made a new proposal that was not sufficiently funded.",454,,
1443,0.97,7810.569,7815.474,Second part of this package would provide funding for an item originally proposed by Councilmember Peterson and I will let him speak to that.,454,,
1444,0.97,7815.474,7828.887,I think there are much better uses of funding then as opposed to the center city streetcar.,454,,
1445,0.97,7828.887,7830.989,I noted my position on the center city streetcar previously.,454,,
1446,0.97,7830.989,7833.292,In the interest of time I will not repeat that.,454,,
1447,0.97,7833.292,7853.312,"As it relates specifically to questions that I have heard about the funding source, I just want to clarify the funds here are a one time investment only and would not impact the revenue stream beyond 2020.",454,,
1448,0.97,7853.312,7854.213,Thank you.,454,,
1449,0.97,7854.213,7854.88,Thank you.,455,,
1450,0.97,7854.88,7855.814,I see a few hands.,455,,
1451,0.97,7855.814,7856.882,"Councilmember Peterson, please go ahead.",455,,
1452,0.97,7856.882,7859.718,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,456,,
1453,0.97,7859.718,7873.799,"I am in full support of this was Councilmember Herbold . I want to see that $400,000 of these funds would be reallocated.",456,,
1454,0.97,7873.799,7876.235,If this were to pass it would help with the emerging issue.,456,,
1455,0.97,7876.235,7890.549,A Long-Standing issue but we really heard a lot about it this fall with the school bus crisis with Seattle public schools and with the shortage of drivers.,456,,
1456,0.97,7890.549,7892.05,But it is the technology solution to help.,456,,
1457,0.97,7892.05,7898.123,The new routes are printed out on paper.,456,,
1458,0.97,7898.123,7904.429,"As drivers and as new drivers come in, this Gps technology would enable Seattle public school bus drivers to implement a much more efficient system.",456,,
1459,0.97,7904.429,7913.672,It is a one time investment that we would be providing to our mutual constituents.,456,,
1460,0.97,7913.672,7920.412,The parents of all the children in public schools would benefit from this and be able to track the buses and where they are as well.,456,,
1461,0.97,7920.412,7926.618,It benefits the school bus drivers as well as the parents and Seattle public schools in general.,456,,
1462,0.97,7926.618,7934.293,I want to echo what Councilmember Herbold said about the source of funding.,456,,
1463,0.97,7934.293,7947.572,These are both one-time investments and I think it is a good use of these funds right now.,456,,
1464,0.97,7947.572,7948.173,Thank you.,456,,
1465,0.97,7948.173,7949.207,Thank you very much.,457,,
1466,0.97,7949.207,7950.609,Councilmember Strauss I see your hand up.,457,,
1467,0.97,7950.609,7953.679,Thank you chair and Councilmember Herbold for bringing this amendment forward.,458,,
1468,0.97,7953.679,7965.257,"I wholeheartedly support the citywide hiring incentive and I also wholeheartedly support Councilmember Peterson's request regarding the $400,000 to go to school bus routing.",458,,
1469,0.97,7965.257,7971.363,I have issue today is the funding source.,458,,
1470,0.97,7971.363,7972.431,I know we don't always agree.,458,,
1471,0.97,7972.431,7975.534,I know there is still a lot of conversation to be had about the streetcar.,458,,
1472,0.97,7975.534,7985.243,I just find it hard to kill the project in some sense through doing good elsewhere.,458,,
1473,0.97,7985.243,7987.713,If there was another funding source I would wholeheartedly vote for this.,458,,
1474,0.97,7987.713,7989.348,I can't support it in its current Iteration.,458,,
1475,0.97,7989.348,7997.589,I do have a voice vote for the voice amendment if you would be interested.,458,,
1476,0.97,7997.589,8009.034,"I know the other revenue source, this is a poison filled revenue source for me and I know the revenue stabilization fund is a poison pill for yourself and others on the Council.",458,,
1477,0.97,8009.034,8011.036,That is the vote I have today.,458,,
1478,0.97,8011.036,8017.075,"Chair, I would bring that forward at your direction.",458,,
1479,0.97,8017.075,8027.219,"Councilmember Strauss, I believe it is your call if you want to make a voice, you need to offer it as a proposed amendment.",459,,
1480,0.97,8027.219,8036.661,If you are suggesting that for discussion we would welcome that as well from the sponsor.,459,,
1481,0.97,8036.661,8044.403,I think folks know very well how I feel about those reserves and I do have some concerns about the existing revenue source identified in this amendment as well.,459,,
1482,0.97,8044.403,8046.671,"If you want to offer an amendment, that is your prerogative.",459,,
1483,0.97,8046.671,8048.974,"Yes, I would love to.",460,,
1484,0.97,8048.974,8055.68,I don't know if you want me to share screen for the language or if the clerks can.,460,,
1485,0.97,8055.68,8059.084,I have the script before me.,460,,
1486,0.97,8059.084,8071.096,I would like to move to amend agenda item 198 as follows.,460,,
1487,0.97,8071.096,8096.254,"Amend the title to cut 2.4 million general fund contribution to the revenue stabilization Fund, add $400,000 general fund to Deel and $2 million for general finance for citywide hiring incentive.",460,,
1488,0.97,8096.254,8099.357,Amend the budget description and transactions for budget source.,460,,
1489,0.97,8099.357,8110.836,Be a reduction to the contribution to the Rss rather than cutting the 2022 general fund for the center city streetcar.,460,,
1490,0.97,8110.836,8119.544,Councilmember Strauss has moved the voice amendment to move the source of the revenue to come from the revenue stabilization fund as noted in the screen in front of us and described by Councilmember Strass.,461,,
1491,0.97,8119.544,8124.282,Is there a second to this voice amendment?,461,,
1492,0.97,8124.282,8127.385,Is there a second?,461,,
1493,0.97,8127.385,8128.653,"Councilmember Strauss, is there a second?",461,,

1496,0.97,8141.099,8155.78,The voice amendment to consider the change as proposed in the CBA action title in front of us and noted by Councilmember Strauss has been Seconded.,463,,
1497,0.97,8155.78,8174.533,"Councilmember Strauss I would ask that we consider this item if it is going to relate directly to reserves in group D. I would like for the Council to consider holding this item until group D so colleagues, I'm going to make a motion to consider that.",463,,
1498,0.97,8174.533,8191.116,I would like to go ahead and consider including CBA Sdot-107- A-001 as part of our conversation in group D. this would be included in the discussion after the newly added number 199.,463,,
1499,0.97,8191.116,8194.152,Is there any objection?,463,,
1500,0.97,8194.152,8210.635,"Hearing no objection, we will consider this item in group D given the Seconded amendment that relates to the revenue source.",463,,

1509,0.97,8268.96,8280.405,The 2022 proposed budget ends the public use of the Referenced facility and it would become available for community members to rent for discrete events and programs.,466,,
1510,0.97,8280.405,8287.045,This amendment which is sponsored by Councilmember Pederson would restore its community centered use.,466,,
1511,0.97,8287.045,8303.395,"The staff Deviously assigned there have been reassigned to other SPR programs, it would add new positions and these position costs would be offset by cutting the amount that is currently budgeted for 2022 annual wage increases for a Subset of SPR staff.",466,,
1512,0.97,8303.395,8307.666,Thank you very much.,467,,
1513,0.97,8307.666,8309.167,Please go ahead.,467,,
1514,0.97,8309.167,8310.969,"Councilmember, would you like to move the item?",467,,
1515,0.97,8310.969,8323.982,"Yes, colleagues I would like to move item 200 which is Spr- 015-A-001.",468,,
1516,0.97,8323.982,8325.95,"Thank you very much, it has been moved.",469,,
1517,0.97,8325.95,8336.294,Is there a second?,469,,
1518,0.97,8336.461,8339.964,"Second, I want to learn more about it.",470,,
1519,0.97,8339.964,8341.032,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,471,,
1520,0.97,8341.032,8342.0,It has been moved and Seconded.,471,,
1521,0.97,8342.0,8343.201,"Councilmember Pederson, please go ahead.",471,,
1522,0.97,8343.201,8345.203,Thank you.,472,,
1523,0.97,8345.203,8375.433,"Colleagues, the parks Department is proposing to permanently close the community center, the parks Department is proposing to close this community center and they did it with no advanced notice to the community or outreach and I really appreciate everybody's support for the addition to the program in Magness park as part of our earlier approval of the consent package.",472,,
1524,0.97,8375.433,8389.647,This amendment is asking that we retain for the general public an existing community center so that programming can continue to be provided at a time when another community center in the area will be closed for most of 2022.,472,,
1525,0.97,8389.647,8396.721,"The proposed closure of $190,000 cut to this was a surprise to me and to the community.",472,,
1526,0.97,8396.721,8400.258,I think we should restore it.,472,,
1527,0.97,8400.258,8413.938,The source of funds is from the highest-paid Non-Represented employees in the parks Department.,472,,
1528,0.97,8413.938,8424.883,"There is an ad for pay raise for these Non-Represented executives, managers and strategic advisors.",472,,
1529,0.97,8424.883,8430.622,It would be taking a portion of that to pay for keeping the Laurelhurst immunity center open.,472,,
1530,0.97,8430.622,8435.293,Thank you member Pederson.,473,,
1531,0.97,8435.293,8437.295,Are there any additional comments or questions?,473,,
1532,0.97,8437.295,8444.402,Thank you for acknowledging that I am having technological problems here.,474,,
1533,0.97,8444.402,8445.904,I appreciate that.,474,,
1534,0.97,8445.904,8447.705,"Councilmember Pederson, thank you for bringing this up again.",474,,
1535,0.97,8447.705,8456.08,Let me explain why parks and myself will be voting no on this.,474,,
1536,0.97,8456.08,8464.923,The amendment would restore that Lowell Laurelhurst community center that was eliminated in the Mayor's budget.,474,,
1537,0.97,8464.923,8477.936,Seattle parks and Rec operates 26 community centers.,474,,
1538,0.97,8477.936,8481.606,Laurelhurst is one of the smallest and it is located within three miles of three other Community centers.,474,,
1539,0.97,8481.606,8482.907,It doesn't have an attached gym.,474,,
1540,0.97,8482.907,8484.742,They host some limited recreation programming and short-term facility rentals.,474,,
1541,0.97,8484.742,8488.413,It does not host licensed Childcare either or showers.,474,,
1542,0.97,8488.413,8492.05,The return on the investment with the amendment is extremely low compared to that of the Mayor's proposal.,474,,
1543,0.97,8492.05,8511.769,The Mayor's proposal eliminates two part-time positions from Laurelhurst community center and uses the resources to activate over 6000 participants citywide in the street program compared to the limited programming of events at the community center in Laurelhurst which has around 200 participants.,474,,
1544,0.97,8511.769,8527.952,"At the community center is closed and Transitioned into a full-time rental facility, Seattle parks and Rec will continue to offer some programming at the adjacent Laurelhurst elementary gym following the Mayor's proposed change.",474,,
1545,0.97,8527.952,8541.399,I do not support this amendment because it would limit the potential of the building to be used as a rental facility similar to that of golden gardens Bathhouse which is in high demand for groups like the rack in the streets program.,474,,
1546,0.97,8541.399,8546.104,It delivers programming in partnership using Neighborhood- based data and equity maps.,474,,
1547,0.97,8546.104,8554.212,This is something we have been working on since 2016.,474,,
1548,0.97,8554.212,8563.888,So when voting against this amendment you would be allowing Seattle parks and Rec to eliminate two part-time positions and use those resources to create capacity for Rec in the streets.,474,,
1549,0.97,8563.888,8565.69,There are no layoffs associated with these changes.,474,,
1550,0.97,8565.69,8571.129,The change is a net zero reallocation of existing resources.,474,,
1551,0.97,8571.129,8603.328,"I know we do this a lot, so following in your footsteps Madam chair, I do want to thank Councilmember Pederson and we had some off-line discussions about the community center and its position in the Laurelhurst community and I do understand the importance and the need of community centers but I also want to add that we have revamped what the public benefit is in the racial and social justice equity analysis that accompanies that for community centers that they are used citywide and the programs are citywide.",474,,
1552,0.97,8603.328,8606.664,We have worked very hard to instill that the public benefit piece is explained completely.,474,,
1553,0.97,8606.664,8609.667,It isn't just that neighborhood but all the neighborhoods.,474,,
1554,0.97,8609.667,8624.182,"Again, I have had discussions with the superintendent and Councilmember Pederson to discuss alternatives, opportunities what the future could look like for the Laurelhurst community center.",474,,
1555,0.97,8624.182,8659.017,"We have the same thing happen with the Lake City community center where we didn't get total funding in which we were renting out space to sound generations, boys and girls Club, particular events, with that and I know Councilmember Pederson that you are concerned that you were not told that it was going to shut down, I wasn't either until I saw it in the budget and had a chance to talk to the superintendent and a chance to talk to you.",474,,
1556,0.97,8659.017,8660.618,"With that, I will be voting no.",474,,
1557,0.97,8660.618,8660.918,Thank you.,474,,
1558,0.97,8660.918,8662.12,Thank you very much.,475,,
1559,0.97,8662.12,8664.922,Just to clarify in the proposed budget from the Mayor's office.,475,,
1560,0.97,8664.922,8667.425,Council member Pederson is anything else you'd like to add?,475,,
1561,0.97,8667.425,8667.992,"Yes, thank you.",476,,
1562,0.97,8667.992,8678.77,"I appreciate that . to clarify, this cut came from the Durkin administration.",476,,
1563,0.97,8678.77,8691.516,"The Laurelhurst immunity center is connected to the elementary school nearby which 45% of those students are black, indigenous or people of color.",476,,
1564,0.97,8691.516,8694.652,31% of the students are low income.,476,,
1565,0.97,8694.652,8702.126,I support the Rec in the streets.,476,,
1566,0.97,8702.126,8708.366,I don't support the Highest- paid executives and parks Department giving themselves a raise while they close a community center in my district.,476,,
1567,0.97,8708.366,8732.39,I do appreciate the dozens of Emails we received from folks in the community trying to keep this open and we will look forward to working with the next administration to see what we can do to expand programming there and provide the best possible access and equity at that center.,476,,
1568,0.97,8732.39,8734.992,Thank you.,476,,
1569,0.97,8734.992,8736.527,"Okay, thank you very much Councilmember Pederson.",477,,
1570,0.97,8736.527,8739.097,I'm going to go ahead and call for the vote on this item.,477,,

1592,0.97,8789.28,8789.847,The motion fails.,481,,
1593,0.97,8789.847,8792.049,The amendment is not adopted.,481,,
1594,0.97,8792.049,8798.523,Council colleagues we are at the end of group C. if my notes are correct.,481,,
1595,0.97,8798.523,8799.423,My notes are correct.,481,,
1596,0.97,8799.423,8802.86,We are at the end of group C and it is 423.,481,,
1597,0.97,8802.86,8825.483,I would very much like to for your consideration of continuing this conversation so we can have a wrapped up discussion by the end of the day that allows for our central staff to be able to get right to work with finalizing the proposed budget so we can be ready to act on Monday.,481,,
1598,0.97,8825.483,8831.989,"I am hoping that we will be able to get through the next section D with some robust discussion, respectful dialogue.",481,,
1599,0.97,8831.989,8838.396,I know that we are interested in the health and safety of our committee put those reserves.,481,,
1600,0.97,8838.396,8849.006,With that in mind let's go ahead and go on into items D on our group list here.,481,,
1601,0.97,8849.006,8852.677,Allie would you add anything else for context as we consider group D in front of us?,481,,
1602,0.97,8852.677,8858.216,Thank you very much Allie and Patty.,481,,
1603,0.97,8858.216,8865.99,I do see you have provided a revised list in front of us so we have all of the items that have been moved to group D in front of us for the purposes of following the conversation.,481,,
1604,0.97,8865.99,8867.625,Both for Council members and Embers of the public.,481,,
1605,0.97,8867.625,8871.629,Would you like to walk us through this?,481,,
1606,0.97,8871.629,8872.096,Thank you.,482,,
1607,0.97,8872.096,8875.6,There are several amendments in this group.,482,,
1608,0.97,8875.6,8880.938,The majority of them are proposing to use the fiscal reserves.,482,,
1609,0.97,8880.938,8881.939,We already describe the first item.,482,,
1610,0.97,8881.939,8903.261,I will be tracking along the way as each amendment is before you if they pass at which point we reach having Overspent the amount of fiscal reserves or the total amount that the Council could reduce the contribution to fiscal reserves in 2022.,482,,
1611,0.97,8903.261,8904.929,I will be tracking that as we go.,482,,
1612,0.97,8904.929,8910.334,The first item in this group if you want me to just jump in?,482,,
1613,0.97,8910.334,8911.369,That would be great.,483,,
1614,0.97,8911.369,8926.951,It is item 192 moved from group Tfg-901-A-001 sounds old--sponsored by Council member Mosque.,484,,
1615,0.97,8926.951,8945.536,This would cut funds for a FEMA contingency and Reallocate for general fund to address additional revenue shortfall of the food and beverage tax as well as restore the funding for the proposed expansion of the community safety officer program.,484,,
1616,0.97,8945.536,8968.225,This action combined with the omnibus amendment we discussed previously has supported changes in the balancing package to continue the proposed expansion of the community safety officer program in 2022 to address the revenue shortfall in the food and beverage tax and also supported by some of the actions in the omnibus amendment.,484,,
1617,0.97,8968.225,8972.43,I believe that there.,484,,
1618,0.97,8972.43,8975.733,I'm going to go ahead and move the items so it is in front of us.,485,,
1619,0.97,8975.733,8991.248,I do have a verbal amendment that I have sent around earlier this morning to make a small notification based on some conversations we had with community partners and the reality of when to stand up for that program.,485,,
1620,0.97,8991.248,9003.661,"Colleagues, I move to consider Fg-901-A-001 . is there a second?",485,,
1621,0.97,9003.661,9004.261,Second.,486,,
1622,0.97,9004.261,9005.796,It has been moved and Seconded?,487,,
1623,0.97,9005.796,9020.444,"As Allie described this initial amendment was offering the ability to do a number of things, one of which is to make sure as we have continued to hear from Council members there has been strong support for the community service officer program.",487,,
1624,0.97,9020.444,9037.194,There was support two months ago with making sure they have the funding needed to fill 10 vacant positions and I would like to see if it is more appropriate for me to pause to see if someone should describe the walkout amendment and then I could move it.,487,,
1625,0.97,9037.194,9045.903,Would that be appropriate?,487,,
1626,0.97,9045.903,9055.813,"Patty, if you could put the verbal amendment for this item on the screen and I'm going to ask my colleague, Greg Dawson to help explain this one.",488,,
1627,0.97,9055.813,9057.248,But I can provide the initial overview.,488,,
1628,0.97,9057.248,9076.4,"In general, this would change the proposed reduction from the FEMA contingency to 1.6 million and it would assume delayed or staggered hiring dates for the proposed expansion of the community safety officer programs.",488,,
1629,0.97,9076.4,9098.322,"It would provide about $900,000 funding in 2022 for the community safety officer program which is about $400,000 less than what was proposed and would retain some funding as a FEMA contingency should some of the expenditures that the city has been undertaking not be reimbursed.",488,,
1630,0.97,9098.322,9128.385,"What I would have to add to that is that the reduction in the community service officer funding, you may be familiar that it was proposed in the Mayor's proposed 2022 budget, the $400,000 reduction would assume that the police Department would have some way of getting the folks on board through the hiring process.",489,,
1631,0.97,9128.385,9133.757,The folks would be coming in staggered toward the second quarter.,489,,
1632,0.97,9133.757,9143.3,"And through the summer and the $400,000 adjustment is this salary adjustment under those assumptions.",489,,
1633,0.97,9143.3,9144.101,Thank you very much.,490,,
1634,0.97,9144.101,9148.606,"In order to make that adjustment and the slight reduction, thank you very much.",490,,
1635,0.97,9148.606,9185.843,"My verbal amendment to Fg-901-A- 001 is to instead of two, we would reduce the Clfr funds and reallocated for general Fund and the suite and beverage replacement tax and provide funding for salaries and vehicles for the staggered expansion starting in quarter two of the community safety officer program.",490,,
1636,0.97,9185.843,9188.913,Úthat would allow for the Scaling up and expansion of the program as originally suggested.,490,,
1637,0.97,9188.913,9194.218,Is there a second?,490,,
1638,0.97,9194.218,9194.652,Second.,491,,
1639,0.97,9194.652,9195.452,Thank you very much.,492,,
1640,0.97,9195.452,9199.523,"Colleagues, appreciate the opportunity to have this verbal amendment in front of you.",492,,
1641,0.97,9199.523,9233.791,"It does a number of things so I want to point out the importance of having been able to offer stability and funding back to the sugar and beverage tax . In order for us to respond to the sharp decrease in revenues they have experienced because of Covid and fewer people eating out and ordering Sodas and things like that, we want to make sure we responded so the programs they are serving and the assistance they are offering does not see a rapid decline.",492,,
1642,0.97,9233.791,9238.963,We did not want to reduce any funding for the sugary sweet beverage tax.,492,,
1643,0.97,9238.963,9251.208,We wanted to work with teamsters 117 and identify ways to add an additional six FTE's.,492,,
1644,0.97,9251.208,9276.634,"These are largely being filled by individuals coming from communities of color who have more trust and more opportunities to engage with the community with not having a gun in hand and that allows for us to create more trusting engagement and as we said before, the city council could really work to Prioritize getting the Scl up in the first place.",492,,
1645,0.97,9276.634,9281.805,Our vice chair is leading that effort.,492,,
1646,0.97,9281.805,9289.113,We will continue to work to have a conversation about where the best place is to house the CSO's.,492,,
1647,0.97,9289.113,9303.827,I would very much like to have a community oriented house or Department for them in the future but that is not what this conversation is about today.,492,,
1648,0.97,9303.827,9317.374,It is about making sure we are allowing for this to be stood up and expand those services beginning in quarter two and I appreciate the work you all have done in the past so we can build on this.,492,,
1649,0.97,9317.374,9319.943,Thank you two teamsters 117 for their conversation about this amendment and support.,492,,
1650,0.97,9319.943,9320.878,"Councilmember Herbold, go ahead.",492,,
1651,0.97,9320.878,9331.622,"I wanted to speak to the base motion but first, because we have an amendment before us I had a question about the amendment.",493,,
1652,0.97,9331.622,9333.157,Can I ask that?,493,,
1653,0.97,9333.157,9335.793,Please go ahead.,494,,
1654,0.97,9335.793,9350.207,"As it relates to the amendment I am curious as to the amount being $400,000 in this case.",495,,
1655,0.97,9350.207,9384.408,"Back when we were amending the Mayor's budget as opposed to making changes to Madame chairs balancing package, I had an amendment related to the Mayor's proposed funding for the CSO expansion allowing that to move forward but provides a wing dollars associated with the gap in time that was estimated that they would not be able to hire for in 2022.",495,,
1656,0.97,9384.408,9388.212,"This particular action cut 400,000.",495,,
1657,0.97,9388.212,9404.428,"I was instructed if I wanted to do the same thing that you are doing with your reduction, if I wanted to proviso the funds that the dollar amount at the time was $200,000.",495,,
1658,0.97,9404.428,9411.235,I am just wondering why that number has changed in the last couple of weeks.,495,,
1659,0.97,9411.235,9417.574,That is because the assumptions are different.,496,,
1660,0.97,9417.574,9435.592,"The assumptions were that it was going to be the end of the first quarter that you would have all of the members on board and that would be equal to 200,000 and the assumptions behind this one are and of second quarter with 400,000.",496,,
1661,0.97,9435.592,9435.993,Okay.,497,,
1662,0.97,9435.993,9446.904,"By allowing for that staggering, they probably won't come all at the same time.",498,,
1663,0.97,9446.904,9454.511,"Some come midway through quarter to and some at the end and some at the beginning of the next quarter, then the staggered opportunity allows for the funding to be there when they do come.",498,,
1664,0.97,9454.511,9464.321,I also would say we are not putting any Provisos on the language as you currently see so they will be able to continue to hire.,498,,
1665,0.97,9464.321,9466.123,We hope they can hire at a faster rate.,498,,
1666,0.97,9466.123,9469.626,We will continue to adjust if there is additional funding needed.,498,,
1667,0.97,9469.626,9471.428,"Councilmember Lewis, please go ahead.",498,,
1668,0.97,9471.428,9476.133,Thank you Madam chair.,499,,
1669,0.97,9476.133,9490.614,I just want to thank you for bringing this amendment forward here and just express my gratitude for being able to work with you in bringing this to be here today.,499,,
1670,0.97,9490.614,9501.625,I had prepared a similar but different CBA Effectuating a similar result and withdrew it in anticipation of supporting this amendment today.,499,,

1699,0.97,9599.756,9601.158,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",506,,
1700,0.97,9601.158,9622.479,Just really quickly I want to recognize that in the earlier rounds of the budget discussions I had a draft amendment that I didn't end up bringing forward that would have moved the CSO's into the new community safety and communications center.,507,,
1701,0.97,9622.479,9632.589,I had met with teamsters and represented CSO's and learned from them that they were ready to make that move.,507,,
1702,0.97,9632.589,9643.367,I assured them that I did not believe that the fact that they weren't ready to make the move would not have an impact on the Council support for their expansion.,507,,
1703,0.97,9643.367,9673.43,So I am really appreciative of Madame chairs action here today in just allowing my anticipated reaction from my colleagues to the effect that they weren't ready to move to be the action of record that we end up taking today.,507,,
1704,0.97,9673.43,9679.302,I was feeling bad when it wasn't in the chairs package.,507,,
1705,0.97,9679.302,9680.437,I really appreciate correcting that here.,507,,
1706,0.97,9680.437,9686.043,The CSO's are very supported in the community.,507,,
1707,0.97,9686.043,9693.717,And really want to work with them in everything that they do to represent immunity safety in our city.,507,,

1731,0.97,9745.902,9753.009,The motion carries on the amended amendment that is adopted.,513,,
1732,0.97,9753.009,9762.719,I believe that puts us at number 201 in voting group D.,513,,
1733,0.97,9762.719,9763.053,Apologies.,513,,
1734,0.97,9763.053,9774.131,I have been asked to provide an overview of this block of SPD amendments so I'm going to do a quick overview here.,514,,
1735,0.97,9774.131,9782.506,"We are going to go into about four amendments, actually three amendments briefly.",514,,
1736,0.97,9782.506,9797.654,We are going to have another walk on proviso that is a Councilmember Pederson walk on that is tied to some of his amendments that will be coming up.,514,,
1737,0.97,9797.654,9800.056,We will only reach that one is some of his amendments passed.,514,,
1738,0.97,9800.056,9819.643,Each of these amendments is sequenced and designed to work in conjunction with the amendments that passed in group A. so as the amendments in group a pass particular cuts to SPD these amendments would restore those cuts and add them back.,514,,
1739,0.97,9819.643,9821.711,They would add them back depending on the particular amendment.,514,,
1740,0.97,9821.711,9826.983,Some partially or some whole and we will be going into each one to talk about that.,514,,
1741,0.97,9826.983,9834.991,"As we progress through the list, the earlier amendments will affect the later amendments.",514,,
1742,0.97,9834.991,9848.838,"So, that is something Allie will be keeping track of both from a use of fiscal reserves standpoint and I will be keeping track of as to the relevance of whether we need to reach the later amendments.",514,,
1743,0.97,9848.838,9860.283,Just wanted to give you that as an overview and then go ahead and jump into the next item which is 201.,514,,
1744,0.97,9860.283,9874.364,"So, this item is an omnibus amendment that at a very high level restores nearly all of the cuts made to the Seattle police Department.",514,,
1745,0.97,9874.364,9881.838,The total amount of cuts that are made to the Seattle police Department in the sheriff's budget is about $10.8 million.,514,,
1746,0.97,9881.838,9889.613,This particular amendment would restore $10 million.,514,,
1747,0.97,9889.613,9903.66,"There is in the Seattle police Department about $850,000 of salary savings that both the Department and the Council acknowledge is Unprogrammed at this point.",514,,
1748,0.97,9903.66,9911.334,"As PD 006, the CBA cuts 850,000 so that is acknowledged a salary savings.",514,,
1749,0.97,9911.334,9924.047,That piece probably wouldn't be captured here but every other CBA and every other cut to the tune of $10 million would be captured by the CBA.,514,,
1750,0.97,9924.047,9934.257,I will do a quick run through of all of the components we are talking about here.,514,,
1751,0.97,9934.257,9939.562,The first one we are talking about is the assumptions that the chairs budget makes a round hiring.,514,,
1752,0.97,9939.562,9950.807,As you will recall it makes some different assumptions about hiring from the Mayor's proposed budget.,514,,
1753,0.97,9950.807,9961.618,The proposed budget believes there are only going to be 94 separations and the chairs budget believes there are going to be 125 separations.,514,,
1754,0.97,9961.618,9963.687,125 separations consist of two parts.,514,,
1755,0.97,9963.687,9968.224,The first being 12 Covid related separations that will happen in January.,514,,
1756,0.97,9968.224,9978.935,And the rest being a hiring separation plan or separation plan that would more or less equal 113 separations.,514,,
1757,0.97,9978.935,9987.944,The same that happened last year in the Council separation plan.,514,,
1758,0.97,9987.944,9993.249,You put those two things together and it will allow the Council to cut $2.7 million.,514,,
1759,0.97,9993.249,9997.554,This package would restore that $2.7 million.,514,,
1760,0.97,9997.554,10006.129,This package would also restore the $1.3 million for personnel costs and vehicles for CSO's.,514,,
1761,0.97,10006.129,10021.044,"Given your actions on the last amendment, this would be something that if you are considering this amendment either the sponsor or another Councilmember may want to consider a verbal amendment to take that piece out otherwise you would be double funding the CSO's.",514,,
1762,0.97,10021.044,10028.785,This particular action would also reverse the overtime cut.,514,,
1763,0.97,10028.785,10034.29,As you will recall there are $7.8 million of new overtime funding in the budget.,514,,
1764,0.97,10034.29,10041.698,And CBA 006 cuts 3.2 million.,514,,
1765,0.97,10041.698,10045.068,This particular action would restore that entire 3.2 million.,514,,
1766,0.97,10045.068,10056.346,"There is in the chairs budget $475,000 of administrative cuts.",514,,
1767,0.97,10056.346,10060.183,"That breaks out into $300,000 of discretionary purchase cuts and $175,000 travel and training cuts respectively.",514,,
1768,0.97,10060.183,10074.464,Those again are in the bill and would be restored in its entirety.,514,,
1769,0.97,10074.464,10077.133,There is also in the Mayor's proposed budget $5 million for technology projects.,514,,
1770,0.97,10077.133,10088.411,The chairs budget would cut 1.24 million of those technology projects and two projects specifically that we have talked about in the past.,514,,
1771,0.97,10088.411,10095.852,This particular amendment would restore those two projects.,514,,
1772,0.97,10095.852,10098.254,And all of those things added together come to $10 million.,514,,
1773,0.97,10098.254,10102.125,And they would be funded by the revenue stabilization fund.,514,,
1774,0.97,10102.125,10111.468,I think it would be important for us to put the chart back on the screen that you Walk-Through on Friday.,515,,
1775,0.97,10111.468,10115.472,We did use the word cut again and we are talking about how we change our language for next year.,515,,
1776,0.97,10115.472,10120.376,These are reduced increases in some cases.,515,,
1777,0.97,10120.376,10121.277,A reduced increased over time.,515,,
1778,0.97,10121.277,10124.714,A reduced increas to technology.,515,,
1779,0.97,10124.714,10128.852,And we have maintained funding for certain areas like travel and training.,515,,
1780,0.97,10128.852,10136.993,We have maintained the investment amounts in the Mayor's budget in a number of places.,515,,
1781,0.97,10136.993,10142.565,I'm not sure if we have the opportunity to pull up that chart or if we need another few minutes.,515,,
1782,0.97,10142.565,10156.98,Could you offer any additional information about the use of the term cut as it relates to the Mayor's proposed package and offer that clarification that we heard so clearly last Friday?,515,,
1783,0.97,10156.98,10157.981,Happy to do so.,516,,
1784,0.97,10157.981,10164.187,The big picture here again is that the Mayor's proposed budget did two things.,516,,
1785,0.97,10164.187,10187.81,"It restored some baseline cuts that were made by the Council last year and it also refunded, or funded 134 vacant police positions that cannot be filled, not even under the executives proposed hiring plan.",516,,
1786,0.97,10187.81,10201.324,So what that did is it created $19 million of salary savings in the Department and that $19 million of salary savings is redistributed along with the baseline ads redistributed towards a number of these areas that we have talked about.,516,,
1787,0.97,10201.324,10241.965,"So, it is the case that those redistributions of that money, of that salary funding, it is the case that it is a cut from the Mayor's proposed budget but it is in actuality redirected salary funding that probably should have in the baseline process gone back into the general Fund and some of these items like say the technology items should have been proposed to the council as their own distinct new items.",516,,
1788,0.97,10241.965,10251.174,"So, it is not so much making a cut as it is choosing to not make an ad.",516,,
1789,0.97,10251.174,10252.175,Thank you so much.,517,,
1790,0.97,10252.175,10256.312,We will take questions about the overview of those three you noted.,517,,
1791,0.97,10256.312,10274.43,"Because you did note the 134 vacant positions that the Mayor's budget continues to assume even if they are redirecting the use of those dollars for one-time purposes by having those vacant positions repeatedly there, we allow for near $20 million to carry over your from your.",517,,
1792,0.97,10274.43,10284.707,Would you mind in your summary here very briefly touching on amendment number 199 which will trail those three that you summarized?,517,,
1793,0.97,10284.707,10291.347,Amendment number 199.,518,,
1794,0.97,10291.347,10300.723,Is that the Abrogation of the 101 positions?,519,,
1795,0.97,10300.723,10336.993,"That is an amendment that is brought by Councilmember Gonzalez and Councilmember Morales as a cosponsor and that is an amendment that would Abrogate 101 positions and by Abrogating those 101 positions it would in future budget years, it would make it technically not possible for the executive to send over a budget that was funding the positions and then moving that money elsewhere for other things.",520,,
1796,0.97,10336.993,10337.593,Thank you.,521,,
1797,0.97,10337.593,10339.462,We will get more details on all of these.,521,,
1798,0.97,10339.462,10341.197,"Councilmember Strauss, I see you have your hand up.",521,,
1799,0.97,10341.197,10344.567,"Before we consider any amendments, we are starting with number 201.",521,,
1800,0.97,10344.567,10351.374,Do you have any additional questions for Greg on this macro perspective?,521,,
1801,0.97,10351.374,10352.375,Go ahead and ask any questions.,521,,
1802,0.97,10352.375,10355.311,Thank you.,522,,
1803,0.97,10355.311,10366.622,"Noting what Greg said, it brought to my attention that the CSO's are part of this amendment as well as some of the other aspects.",522,,
1804,0.97,10366.622,10379.969,There is an amendment from Councilmember Lewis to assume executives staffing plan separations and then Council members Herbold considering hiring incentives.,522,,
1805,0.97,10379.969,10387.51,My request here is if we can put D1 and G2 at the end of the list.,522,,
1806,0.97,10387.51,10394.05,I'm going to support these other bills on the table right now.,522,,
1807,0.97,10394.05,10401.958,And I think that the outcome of those bills will influence my decision about D1 and D2.,522,,
1808,0.97,10401.958,10410.266,Process wise there has been a request to include item D1 and D2 at the end.,523,,
1809,0.97,10410.266,10413.436,So I believe that would mean after number 198.,523,,
1810,0.97,10413.436,10425.882,"Hearing no objection to moving D1, if you have an objection please say objection because there are a few hands up that I think are in the Queue.",523,,
1811,0.97,10425.882,10432.054,I would object to that.,524,,
1812,0.97,10432.054,10433.856,I would object to that as well.,525,,
1813,0.97,10433.856,10434.857,Thank you very much.,526,,
1814,0.97,10434.857,10437.426,I just want to make sure we got through the procedural motions there.,526,,
1815,0.97,10437.426,10439.962,Councilmember Strauss we will continue with the items as listed on the sheet.,526,,
1816,0.97,10439.962,10449.705,We will have a chance to get to everyone.,526,,
1817,0.97,10449.705,10451.14,"All right, I appreciate the overview.",526,,
1818,0.97,10451.14,10455.511,We have three hands for questions and I want to make sure we get into the heart of each of these items.,526,,
1819,0.97,10455.511,10458.414,If you have any clarifying questions that you have before we consider individual amendments.,526,,
1820,0.97,10458.414,10459.615,Councilmember Lewis your hand was up first.,526,,
1821,0.97,10459.615,10473.729,"Just really quickly, Greg can you remind everyone what the two technology adds that Councilmember Mosqueda declined to incorporate in the package as an ad were?",527,,
1822,0.97,10473.729,10474.13,Sure.,528,,
1823,0.97,10474.13,10483.105,There was one called the active workforce wellness management and it was for about a half million dollars.,528,,
1824,0.97,10483.105,10523.679,"It was one that would purchase BIOMEDICAL devices and software that would measure physiological indicators, meaning heart rate, Respirations, skin responses of stress and nervous system responses that police officers might give off as they were heading to calls and listening to live 911 coming over the speakers from Dispatchers or just in general as they were heading to the calls to be able to assess whether or not there would be negative reactions from listening to live 911.",528,,
1825,0.97,10523.679,10533.089,And the other one was called the equity accountability and quality forum and software.,528,,
1826,0.97,10533.089,10568.19,"The idea there was that software would be purchased that would be able to take the body worn camera Video and specifically the Audio that those devices are capturing and transcribe it into written documents and then software would be able to analyze those documents for various kinds of disparity or other kinds of Disproportionality in policing and that would be something that would be done in conjunction with the Oig and that is a project that would cost $740,000.",528,,
1827,0.97,10568.19,10576.299,Those two particular projects are not funded in the chairs package and they together cost 1.2 million.,528,,
1828,0.97,10576.299,10578.634,Thank you.,529,,
1829,0.97,10578.634,10580.403,"Clarifying questions, Councilmember Herbold?",529,,
1830,0.97,10580.403,10582.438,Go ahead.,529,,
1831,0.97,10582.438,10590.646,Not a clarifying question but more a statement around all of the items.,530,,
1832,0.97,10590.646,10592.915,So I don't need to talk on each one of them.,530,,
1833,0.97,10592.915,10600.156,Just an Overarching point on all of the items that rely on the use of physical reserves.,530,,
1834,0.97,10600.156,10617.573,"Even though some of those are items I have supported and cosponsored in earlier rounds, but I just feel very strongly that I want to support the direction from the chair and what we have also heard from central staff and our budget director, doctor noble.",530,,
1835,0.97,10617.573,10632.588,The most recent revenue forecasts raised a note of caution about 2022 revenues with the continuing impact of Covid pandemic regarding payroll tax revenues and commercial parking tax.,530,,
1836,0.97,10632.588,10652.908,We also face the risk of the Chamber's lawsuit against the Jumpstart payroll tax which is on appeal and could blow a $200 million hole in the 2022 budget and leave the 2021.Budget out of balance as well.,530,,
1837,0.97,10652.908,10664.32,"Consequently, all of the items in group D that rely on the use of these reserves, I will not be supporting.",530,,
1838,0.97,10664.32,10669.492,Thank you.,530,,
1839,0.97,10669.492,10678.901,"Councilmember Herbold, I appreciate those comments and thank you for summarizing SOSA stink late the concerns that the city faces from a forecasting perspective and your support for the maintenance of the reserves.",531,,
1840,0.97,10678.901,10685.908,Council member Pederson.,531,,
1841,0.97,10685.908,10686.942,Clarifying questions for macro comments?,531,,
1842,0.97,10686.942,10692.648,Thank you chair Mosqueda and I appreciate Greg's very thorough overview of all of these.,532,,
1843,0.97,10692.648,10728.651,"Just a heads up, in terms of the community service officers, really appreciate the chair and her work for restoring and maintaining the expansion of that program so there would be an amendment I would be making to both 201 and 202 two not double count community officer programs so those amounts would be adjusted Accordingly in the amendment to the amendment and there would also be a proviso on the overtime for both of those amendments for 201 and 202.",532,,
1844,0.97,10728.651,10746.402,There will be a somewhat complicated motion that I would be making and I wanted to give a heads up since we were starting with the $10 million action and 8.7 million because the 1.3 of the community service officers is already elsewhere in the budget.,532,,
1845,0.97,10746.402,10746.802,Thank you.,532,,
1846,0.97,10746.802,10752.441,"Colleagues, I'm not seeing any additional questions for Greg on the overall concepts and issues he has raised so let's go ahead and get into this.",533,,
1847,0.97,10752.441,10757.413,We have in front of us D1 number 201.,533,,
1848,0.97,10757.413,10759.582,Councilmember Pederson would you like to move it for consideration?,533,,
1849,0.97,10759.582,10760.416,Thank you chair.,534,,
1850,0.97,10760.416,10770.159,I am going to move it including those adjustments that I just mentioned.,534,,
1851,0.97,10770.159,10772.428,And the clerk can tell me if I did it correctly here.,534,,
1852,0.97,10772.428,10781.637,"So, I move to.",534,,
1853,0.97,10781.637,10788.11,"Councilmember Pederson, let's move the bill as it is listed on the agenda and if there is a second then you can work to include your verbal amendment.",535,,
1854,0.97,10788.11,10788.611,Thank you chair.,536,,
1855,0.97,10788.611,10798.42,I would like to move item Spd- 015-A-001-2022 on today's agenda.,536,,
1856,0.97,10798.42,10802.858,Second.,537,,
1857,0.97,10802.858,10811.867,"Councilmember Pederson, you are welcome to now if you like make the motion for one minute.",538,,
1858,0.97,10811.867,10820.776,Now I would like to move to amend Spd-015-A-001-2022 as follows.,539,,
1859,0.97,10820.776,10853.475,Substituting the Council budget action title to read as follows to add 8.7 million general fund to restore the cuts and restore he reductions in the CH balancing package and to reduce or cut 8.7 million to the general stabilization Fund and proviso 3.2 million general fund in SPD for overtime.,539,,
1860,0.97,10853.475,10854.51,This is doing two things.,539,,
1861,0.97,10854.51,10861.083,This is reducing the amount because community service officers are already covered elsewhere.,539,,
1862,0.97,10861.083,10861.984,Thank you chair for that.,539,,
1863,0.97,10861.984,10871.026,And it Provisos 3.2 million portion of the overtime as part of this amendment.,539,,
1864,0.97,10871.026,10871.794,It has been moved.,540,,
1865,0.97,10871.794,10874.897,Is there a second?,540,,
1866,0.97,10874.897,10875.197,Second.,541,,
1867,0.97,10875.197,10879.802,"Greg, would you have any additional clarifying comments?",541,,
1868,0.97,10879.802,10886.342,I just want to say that the proviso Councilmember Pederson is actually a separate action.,542,,
1869,0.97,10886.342,10898.254,"I will ask Allie to confirm this for me, but I think in this action you are just amending the dollars to take out the CSO so they are not double funded.",542,,
1870,0.97,10898.254,10912.368,And when you reach your proviso you would change the dollar amount depending on whether Spd- 015-A-001-2022 or Spd-016-A-001- 2022 passes.,542,,
1871,0.97,10912.368,10924.28,"Excuse me, Greg, I think the motion that Councilmember Pederson just made essentially moved his proposed Walk-On into this verbal amendment.",543,,
1872,0.97,10924.28,10939.094,"So, if that passes, if these amendment to the amendment passes, the Walk-On amendment and the overall action passes, the Walk-On amendment would be removed for consideration.",543,,
1873,0.97,10939.094,10939.561,"Okay, great.",544,,
1874,0.97,10939.561,10944.099,So then the Walk-On is now part of this as well?,544,,
1875,0.97,10944.099,10944.667,Yes.,545,,
1876,0.97,10944.667,10948.304,Thank you very much.,546,,
1877,0.97,10948.304,10959.915,Okay colleagues we have the amended version of Spd-015-A- 001-2022 in front of us.,546,,
1878,0.97,10959.915,10966.889,Councilmember Pederson you offered a summary would you like to continue to add to your comments?,546,,
1879,0.97,10966.889,10967.122,Yes.,547,,
1880,0.97,10967.122,10969.425,"I didn't know, do I need a second for that amendment?",547,,
1881,0.97,10969.425,10971.393,I believe you received one from Councilmember Juarez.,548,,
1882,0.97,10971.393,10980.636,"I sure did, thank you.",549,,
1883,0.97,10980.636,10982.004,I will turn it back to you.,549,,
1884,0.97,10982.004,10982.838,Thank you.,550,,
1885,0.97,10982.838,11001.056,"I know as we get into this issue, I just want to thank the chair for her inclusiveness in the budget process and the collaboration and to remind the viewing public of how much we have agreed on today and the unity on so many important issues.",550,,
1886,0.97,11001.056,11005.928,And this issue is always a tough one for the Council.,550,,
1887,0.97,11005.928,11007.963,But it is worth the discussion and the debate.,550,,
1888,0.97,11007.963,11009.865,"So, I appreciate the grace and putting forward this amendment.",550,,
1889,0.97,11009.865,11015.27,I will explain it now.,550,,
1890,0.97,11015.27,11019.875,"So, we have various options before us today on how to address the Mayor's budget request for Seattle's police Department.",550,,
1891,0.97,11019.875,11023.645,And this first option would essentially restore the Mayor's original request.,550,,
1892,0.97,11023.645,11040.396,I appreciate chair Mosqueda elsewhere in the budget making sure we do continue to expand community service officer program Hence the change in the amount here to be .7 million for the restoration.,550,,
1893,0.97,11040.396,11053.208,"Again, this essentially is trying to restore what the Mayor had originally requested the police chief Diaz reiterated there rationale for each of the items requested in the budget.",550,,
1894,0.97,11053.208,11060.416,And the incoming Mayor has also publicly talked about preserving these resources for the Department in 2022.,550,,
1895,0.97,11060.416,11071.293,The Mayor has proposed an overall budget of 365 million which was an increase of about 3 million over the 2021 adopted budget of 362 million.,550,,
1896,0.97,11071.293,11085.34,The various budget reductions already in play would reduce the Mayor's request by nine or 10 million.,550,,
1897,0.97,11085.34,11089.611,We could certainly Dissect each line item further.,550,,
1898,0.97,11089.611,11096.051,But the theme is to honor the executives total request.,550,,
1899,0.97,11096.051,11108.363,"The goal in my mind is to send a positive message to the city government employees in uniform, officers and detectives who remain committed to Seattle knowing that we have much work to do on police accountability issues.",550,,
1900,0.97,11108.363,11123.278,I believe that honoring the original budget request from the executive to help retain officers after Seattle has already experienced a net loss of 200 officers and 100 has since been hired.,550,,
1901,0.97,11123.278,11129.985,I think there is a lot of interest potentially in the next items such as items 202 and 203 on today's agenda.,550,,
1902,0.97,11129.985,11134.623,I don't want to Belabor this point on the particular amendment.,550,,
1903,0.97,11134.623,11139.995,"Again, I believe the issue of how we allocate funds for public safety is an issue of timing.",550,,
1904,0.97,11139.995,11146.902,I would like to see more alternative scale at first and I believe we need to have a police contract revamped.,550,,
1905,0.97,11146.902,11155.344,"I do want to note that this proposal would tap the revenue stabilization Fund, not the emergency Fund.",550,,
1906,0.97,11155.344,11160.015,The amendment leaves intact the emergency Fund.,550,,
1907,0.97,11160.015,11166.321,Councilmember Sawant.,551,,
1908,0.97,11166.321,11166.922,One second please.,551,,
1909,0.97,11166.922,11169.591,Allie did you have a clarifying comment you would like to offer?,551,,
1910,0.97,11169.591,11185.741,I just want to take a minute to read the proviso into the record so it is clear for the public what the proviso does as part of the conversation if that would make sense.,552,,
1911,0.97,11185.741,11186.208,Go ahead.,553,,
1912,0.97,11186.208,11200.889,So what is on the screen in front of you is the Walk-On amendment that Councilmember Pederson distributed before 5:00 yesterday that he just verbally included in this amendment with a slight modification in terms of the amount.,554,,
1913,0.97,11200.889,11214.169,"What the proviso would do is say of the appropriation in the 2022 budget for the Seattle police Department special operations budget summary level, 3.2 million may not be spent until authorized by a future ordinance.",554,,
1914,0.97,11214.169,11222.778,"I just want to make sure that is clear on what the restriction would be, what restriction would be imposed by this section.",554,,
1915,0.97,11222.778,11224.379,Thank you for waiting.,555,,
1916,0.97,11224.379,11230.686,Please go ahead.,555,,
1917,0.97,11230.686,11241.296,I know we have discussed the amendment to the amendment and the amendment itself.,556,,
1918,0.97,11241.296,11252.274,I will be voting no on the overall budget amendment but I believe we will be doing and amendment vote on the amendment to the amendment and I will be voting yes on that.,556,,
1919,0.97,11252.274,11260.882,"I just want to clarify two members of the public that regardless of the results of that vote, I will be voting no on the overall amendment.",556,,
1920,0.97,11260.882,11264.786,Thank you so much.,556,,
1921,0.97,11264.786,11272.728,"Because of the technical nature of the reduction in the amount, is that correct is that what you are Slagging?",557,,
1922,0.97,11272.728,11273.328,Yes.,558,,
1923,0.97,11273.328,11276.231,It is a technical amendment.,559,,
1924,0.97,11276.231,11276.498,,560,,
1925,0.97,11276.498,11279.701,"Allie, I see your hand.",561,,
1926,0.97,11279.701,11282.738,You have a clarifying comment?,561,,
1927,0.97,11282.738,11285.907,"Councilmember Lewis, please go ahead.",561,,
1928,0.97,11285.907,11300.422,"Following on Council members so once comments just now, is what is before us voting to reflect the addition back of the CSO's?",562,,
1929,0.97,11300.422,11306.028,"So if I have comments on the overall amendment, should I wait?",562,,
1930,0.97,11306.028,11306.428,Just clarifying.,562,,
1931,0.97,11306.428,11313.568,If I can answer and maybe central staff has a comment as well.,563,,
1932,0.97,11313.568,11315.237,This is just the technical aspect of it.,563,,
1933,0.97,11315.237,11324.379,"If you would like to speak to the overall budget implications, you are welcome to maybe just as soon as we get through this technical amendment.",563,,
1934,0.97,11324.379,11330.686,Let's just do this first and then I will make more comments later.,564,,
1935,0.97,11330.686,11339.327,Any other additional comments on the amendment to Spd-015-A-001-2022?,565,,

1958,0.97,11403.725,11417.672,Happy to jump in and have this discussion and appreciate that Councilmember Pederson brought this forward so we can have this conversation since there has been so much scrutiny of this area in the news recently.,569,,
1959,0.97,11417.672,11438.96,I want to start just by doing a little bit of table setting in talking about this and really hold up the balancing package that Councilmember Mosqueda has put forward to just recognize things that I don't think have been fairly recognized in some of the public scrutiny.,569,,
1960,0.97,11438.96,11445.6,This will be disappointing to some members of the public on both sides who have been following this discussion.,569,,
1961,0.97,11445.6,11452.607,"No matter how these amendments go today, there is a fully funded hiring plan for SPD.",569,,
1962,0.97,11452.607,11457.479,That Councilmember Mosqueda has funded that has not always been fairly recognized in the discourse we have been facing.,569,,
1963,0.97,11457.479,11476.431,"For folks who are advocate of Defunding, no matter what with these amendments from Council member Pederson and Councilmember Juarez and myself there will be a fully funded hiring package whether these amendments passed or not.",569,,
1964,0.97,11476.431,11492.314,I think it is important to note the Restorations of overtime funding relative to 2020 and other additions requested by the Department and the Mayor that Councilmember Mosqueda has incorporated into her baseline package.,569,,
1965,0.97,11492.314,11508.73,I just want to express my gratitude at the opening here at the diligence of chair Mosqueda and central staff in incorporating and taking in a lot of those priorities for the budget.,569,,
1966,0.97,11508.73,11514.87,"That said, I do think there are things in these amendments that I would like to Tweak to build on some of those themes.",569,,
1967,0.97,11514.87,11530.151,I cannot support this particular amendment from Councilmember Pederson and I do have three reasons and wanted to go on the record why I will not be supporting this particular $8.7 million amendment.,569,,
1968,0.97,11530.151,11552.908,The first one was alluded to by Councilmember Herbold with her Referencing a November 18 memo that we received from budget director indicating that the years ahead potentially layout some concerning scenarios about the Sustainability of the city's overall budget.,569,,
1969,0.97,11552.908,11563.285,The revenue stabilization fund is going to be an important component of making sure that we can balance and sustain certain priorities in Worst- case scenarios.,569,,
1970,0.97,11563.285,11582.437,I think it is important that we really Prioritize looking into what we are doing at this moment right now to make some final additions to the chairs balancing package in the message that we are sending on the revenue stabilization fund.,569,,
1971,0.97,11582.437,11596.651,I do think it is appropriate and I sponsored several ads this afternoon seeking to take from the funds so I am obviously not a stickler about it.,569,,
1972,0.97,11596.651,11615.337,"But to the extent that we can triage in talking specifically about this fund in terms of what we are willing to fund, I think it should be limited to things that are most essential, things that lead to increased accountability in city service delivery or things that leverage external funding opportunities.",569,,
1973,0.97,11615.337,11617.872,I will talk about some of that in some of my other amendments.,569,,
1974,0.97,11617.872,11655.677,I think that with this amendment and the way it is distinct from Councilmember Pederson's next proposal that I will be voting for and I will go into the details and why I'm voting for that next is the most important considerations in front of us that could have an impact in terms of service delivery on the street for public safety systems is really the items that are baked into that second amendment and really the things that we have been talking about in the public discourse that the public is concerned about.,569,,
1975,0.97,11655.677,11665.954,It is hiring incentives to make sure that we can continue to attract and retain given our hiring challenges in the Seattle police Department.,569,,
1976,0.97,11665.954,11684.105,It is increased over time for events seeing the Seattle crack and now playing and a large return of community events and sporting events in 2022 relative to 2021.,569,,
1977,0.97,11684.105,11705.86,And a change in the attrition assumptions which I brought a separate amendment to discuss even further in which I would like to plan for the contingencies in regards to now rather than waiting for potential supplemental if our predictions are wrong and I'm happy to talk about more that in future amendment discussions.,569,,
1978,0.97,11705.86,11707.962,Those are the most important considerations that are included in this amendment.,569,,
1979,0.97,11707.962,11720.775,They are also included in Councilmember Pederson second proposed amendment and they are included to a certain extent in an amendment that I have brought.,569,,
1980,0.97,11720.775,11772.961,That brings me to my third and last consideration which is I frankly do think there are some things that Councilmember Mosqueda did not add that were prudent decisions to not add at its current time given the information that we know and I did ask Greg Doss some questions at the beginning here just to clarify specifically the technology investments which is a component of this amendment that Councilmember Pederson has brought forward today of two technology projects that I think this counsel largely AGREES and chair Mosqueda has indicated her thoughts on this multiple times that these are good technology investments that would be nice to have I given the variety of budget pressures.,569,,
1981,0.97,11772.961,11782.837,These are things we should continue to look at and defer to a future time to budget rather than fund right now.,569,,
1982,0.97,11782.837,11799.354,I think the thing that is really going to deliver the essential public safety services that a lot of us were talking about in the public discourse are included in the upcoming amendment from Councilmember Pederson that I believe once amended will come in at 4.02 million.,569,,
1983,0.97,11799.354,11806.361,That amendment I think is a prudent and effective response to the public safety challenges we are facing in the city right now.,569,,
1984,0.97,11806.361,11825.68,I think it also balances the pressure on this particular funding source given the concerns that have been expressed by the city budget office and central staff and I will be voting no on this amendment but voting yes on the coming amendment.,569,,
1985,0.97,11825.68,11826.781,Thank you.,569,,
1986,0.97,11826.781,11827.782,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,570,,
1987,0.97,11827.782,11830.785,Any additional comments or questions on this amendment?,570,,
1988,0.97,11830.785,11835.857,Okay.,571,,
1989,0.97,11835.857,11838.193,Hearing none I would encourage a no vote as well.,571,,
1990,0.97,11838.193,11858.58,"I will not underscore again the points that were made by Councilmember Lewis a moment ago about the use of the reserves, but especially trying to weigh the importance of getting prepared for the downturn in the economy coming if that materializes and or an Uptick in Coronavirus cases, we need to be prepared.",571,,
1991,0.97,11858.58,11861.783,"For that and other policy considerations that I have articulated before, I will be voting no.",571,,
1992,0.97,11861.783,11866.921,Thank you Councilmember Pederson for bringing this forward and allowing this discussion.,571,,
1993,0.97,11866.921,11877.632,Madam clerk will you please call the role on the adoption of Spd-015-A-001-2022 as amended.,571,,
1994,0.97,11877.632,11879.601,Pederson?,572,,
1995,0.97,11879.601,11880.401,Yes.,572,,

2002,0.97,11895.75,11897.051,No.,572,,
2003,0.97,11897.051,11901.956,Juarez? yes.,572,,
2004,0.97,11901.956,11902.223,Lewis?,572,,

2007,0.97,11904.659,11907.729,No.,572,,
2008,0.97,11907.729,11909.731,Chair Mosqueda?,572,,
2009,0.97,11909.731,11909.964,No.,572,,
2010,0.97,11909.964,11911.165,"Two in favor, seven opposed.",573,,
2011,0.97,11911.165,11917.372,"Thank you court, the motion fails and the amendment is not adopted.",574,,
2012,0.97,11917.372,11921.743,Let's move on to 202.,574,,
2013,0.97,11921.743,11923.845,Councilmember Pederson I believe this is your amendment again.,574,,
2014,0.97,11923.845,11929.284,"Would you like to move the amendment in front of us, Spd- 016-A-001-2022?",574,,
2015,0.97,11929.284,11931.552,Yes.,575,,
2016,0.97,11931.552,11931.853,Thank you.,575,,
2017,0.97,11931.853,11943.598,"Colleagues, I would like to move Spd-016-A-001-2022 on today's agenda.",575,,
2018,0.97,11943.598,11952.307,Is there a second?,576,,
2019,0.97,11952.307,11952.774,Second.,577,,
2020,0.97,11952.774,11955.71,It has been moved and Seconded.,578,,
2021,0.97,11955.71,11968.423,Councilmember Pederson you are recognized to speak to us or we can have central staff summarize the amendment that I think you are going to make the adjustment as well if you would like to.,578,,
2022,0.97,11968.423,11974.295,Thank you chair.,579,,
2023,0.97,11974.295,11991.245,"Just a quick overview, this is taking some of the feedback received from several colleagues, this is a more surgical or strategic version of the previous amendment and it would be great to hear from central staff to break that down.",579,,
2024,0.97,11991.245,12007.161,And there will be an amendment because the community service officer program that chair Mosqueda is maintaining any expansion of this number will be reduced and then we will put in the proviso right here for the overtime portion of this.,579,,
2025,0.97,12007.161,12018.873,But it would be great if Greg Doss would be willing to run through the line item differences.,579,,
2026,0.97,12018.873,12020.441,Sure.,580,,
2027,0.97,12020.441,12024.912,"If the last one was add nearly everything back, this one is Ed halfback is probably the headline.",580,,
2028,0.97,12024.912,12045.666,"It is a restoration of 5.32 million and of course, as you know Councilmember Pederson after the amendment to adjust for the CSO's that will go to about $4 million.",580,,
2029,0.97,12045.666,12049.837,And then you will also I assume put in your proviso as you said that would restrict the overtime expenditure.,580,,
2030,0.97,12049.837,12051.973,I will go through that.,580,,
2031,0.97,12051.973,12053.007,This one is a little different.,580,,
2032,0.97,12053.007,12070.591,"Starting with the staffing plan, members will remember that there are two components to the reductions that were made or the changes in assumptions that were made to the staffing plan.",580,,
2033,0.97,12070.591,12085.239,"The first component being that there would be 12 Covid separations in January and the rest, the other component being that the separations would look like they did last year.",580,,
2034,0.97,12085.239,12093.748,The assumptions would be the same that there would be 113 leaving throughout the year.,580,,
2035,0.97,12093.748,12109.297,This particular amendment would assume the same 12 Covid separations in January but it Reverts back to the 94 separations that the executive assumes.,580,,
2036,0.97,12109.297,12131.185,"So, basically in a nutshell this is the SPD hiring and separations plan with the exception that it does subtract funding for 12 Covid separations in January.",580,,
2037,0.97,12131.185,12143.064,"So, what that means is that it is adding back $1.43 million for that adjustment.",580,,
2038,0.97,12143.064,12155.643,"So, just to repeat it, it defaults back to the executives staffing plan for 94 separations and hundred and 25 hires.",580,,
2039,0.97,12155.643,12161.382,But it does assume that you would have 12 separations in January.,580,,
2040,0.97,12161.382,12173.394,"So I guess, in essence you would get eventually to 106 separations.",580,,
2041,0.97,12173.394,12176.397,And then it also does add back for the CSO's at 1.3 million.,580,,
2042,0.97,12176.397,12189.243,"With over time, the prior amendment had restored all of the Council cut to overtime which was 3.2 million.",580,,
2043,0.97,12189.243,12194.148,This amendment would restore half of that.,580,,
2044,0.97,12194.148,12195.149,It would restore 1.5 million.,580,,
2045,0.97,12195.149,12217.238,"And then if the proviso is passed, the proviso holds that 1.5 million until future counsel appropriation and the idea being that the Council would monitor the departments overtime use and if such time came along that the Department needed that over time, then they could pass a future ordinance to provide it.",580,,
2046,0.97,12217.238,12226.447,This particular amendment would also add back 1.09 million for the hiring incentives.,580,,
2047,0.97,12226.447,12243.698,"Although, I would point out that given the action that the Council took earlier for the Department to be able to use this money in 2022, the legislation would need to be passed for them to be able to use it.",580,,
2048,0.97,12243.698,12254.275,"And then Finally, it uses again the revenue stabilization fund to pay for these items.",580,,
2049,0.97,12254.275,12260.781,"One difference between this one and the last one, this one does not restore the technology ads.",580,,
2050,0.97,12260.781,12265.486,That is a high-level overview.,580,,
2051,0.97,12265.486,12270.691,I ask if there are any questions?,580,,
2052,0.97,12270.691,12275.63,I would just want to offer a piece of clarification at the end we talked about restoring the overtime.,581,,
2053,0.97,12275.63,12287.842,"As a reminder folks, we have included 4.6 million in new investments in overtime in our underlying budget in front of us.",581,,
2054,0.97,12287.842,12291.946,So this would be adding on top of that $3.2 million that the Mayor had originally asked for.,581,,
2055,0.97,12291.946,12299.954,The existing budget would be add 4.6 million and it includes 26.4 million for overtime.,581,,
2056,0.97,12299.954,12300.554,Any additional questions?,581,,
2057,0.97,12300.554,12310.765,"I would like to have Councilmember Pederson if you would like to move your verbal amendment that Greg just walked through, that would be in front of us for your consideration.",581,,
2058,0.97,12310.765,12321.175,Thank you chair I will make the motion to change the dollar amounts and add the proviso.,582,,
2059,0.97,12321.175,12323.844,It is a lot of information here but I will run through quickly.,582,,
2060,0.97,12323.844,12338.259,I would move to substitute the Council budget action title to read as follows as 4.02 million general fund for partial assumption of the executives staffing plan separations.,582,,
2061,0.97,12338.259,12338.693,Hiring incentives.,582,,
2062,0.97,12338.693,12356.21,I would not have CSO's in their . But over time and then to cut 4.02 million general fund contribution to the revenue stabilization Fund and proviso the 1.5 million general fund in SPD for overtime.,582,,
2063,0.97,12356.21,12375.73,That is the budget action and amending CB five 12 A001 to read as follows.,582,,
2064,0.97,12375.73,12377.398,There is a copy and paste here.,583,,
2065,0.97,12377.398,12377.631,Sorry.,583,,
2066,0.97,12377.631,12401.422,I would be amending the action to add 4.20 million general fund to the chair's balancing package and cut 4.02 million general fund contribution to the revenue stabilization Fund and then adding a proviso of 1.5 million for overtime.,583,,
2067,0.97,12401.422,12412.032,"Before we take a vote on that and ask for a second, I do want to ask if there are any technical changes that central staff would offer to the amendment?",584,,
2068,0.97,12412.032,12413.1,I think that is accurate.,585,,
2069,0.97,12413.1,12439.693,There are a lot of moving pieces but amending the title as Councilmember Pederson described and then central staff as part of the verbal amendment would update the description and transactions to reflect those changes as described by Councilmember Pederson including the proviso language that is the same language we discussed for the previous amendment at the $1.5 million level and apologies for some of the copy and paste errors.,585,,
2070,0.97,12439.693,12440.094,No problem.,586,,
2071,0.97,12440.094,12440.661,Thank you.,586,,
2072,0.97,12440.661,12449.57,It has been moved to amend item 202 as described by the sponsor.,586,,
2073,0.97,12449.57,12454.575,Isthere a second?,586,,
2074,0.97,12454.575,12454.875,Second.,587,,
2075,0.97,12454.875,12459.079,Councilmember Pederson did you have anything else to add to your technical amendment here or any clarifying comments?,588,,
2076,0.97,12459.079,12460.414,Central staff is also involved.,588,,
2077,0.97,12460.414,12462.883,Thank you.,589,,
2078,0.97,12462.883,12474.128,Just to add that what is being proviso for the overtime is a 1.5 million and that is all the overtime that is being restored here.,589,,
2079,0.97,12474.128,12478.799,So all of the overtime being restored here would be proviso would.,589,,
2080,0.97,12478.799,12484.405,The rationale is that I am assuming additional separation in an amount higher than what the Mayor had proposed.,589,,
2081,0.97,12484.405,12504.925,So the additional overtime should be needed to help offset the additional separations so that is the rationale for restoring some of that overtime.,589,,
2082,0.97,12504.925,12506.327,And we do want to proviso that.,589,,
2083,0.97,12506.327,12507.561,I know that is very important.,589,,
2084,0.97,12507.561,12510.631,I just wanted to clarify that regarding overtime.,589,,
2085,0.97,12510.631,12513.267,Central staff's description was excellent in terms of this in the previous amendment.,589,,
2086,0.97,12513.267,12515.269,"Great, did you have anything else you wanted to add?",590,,
2087,0.97,12515.269,12520.641,I do have a question for you Council member Pederson.,591,,
2088,0.97,12520.641,12530.684,"Is this amendment including an additional 400,004 the community safety officers for the CSO?",591,,
2089,0.97,12530.684,12534.321,Is it assuming that funding is needed?,591,,
2090,0.97,12534.321,12536.39,"Okay, it completely does not include any funding for CSO's?",591,,
2091,0.97,12536.39,12538.859,Okay.,591,,
2092,0.97,12538.859,12539.193,All right.,591,,
2093,0.97,12539.193,12541.495,Council members any additional comments or questions?,591,,
2094,0.97,12541.495,12551.205,"Council member Strauss, go ahead.",591,,
2095,0.97,12551.205,12554.341,I just wanted to be clear that I do support our hiring incentives program.,592,,

2100,0.97,12592.413,12600.321,This budget amendment has many things that I do like and some things I don't like.,592,,
2101,0.97,12600.321,12616.27,I know Councilmember Pederson and I had early conversations about how I wished we could have split it out by line items and I made those comments earlier just in this meeting about how we have a number of amendments that get to this very similar proposal.,592,,
2102,0.97,12616.27,12644.198,"I want the record to just reflect that well and not going to be able to support this amendment today, there are many aspects of this amendment that I do support and that I would like to get us to a place to ensure that we have the appropriate dollars for SPD to be able to do their core functions and that we are able to ensure that they have not only the officers that they need but that they are able to hire the officers they need.",592,,

2143,0.97,12770.591,12772.292,It has been going on with my computer.,602,,
2144,0.97,12772.292,12776.296,I'm on the screen and everything is okay.,602,,
2145,0.97,12776.296,12783.504,"First of all, Madam chair thank you that we are going back to the language of it is restoration, not a cut.",602,,
2146,0.97,12783.504,12796.45,"We cleared up all that confusion and thank you, Greg using some of your language that these are not cuts but we are choosing to add back in and thank you for your leadership Madam chair for that CSO's.",602,,
2147,0.97,12796.45,12826.58,"I'm going to be voting yes on number 202 for many reasons but I don't want to go into all of the specifics of what we have been dealing with, but I want to kind of go to the sensibilities of what has happened and what we have learned a lot of since the summer and fall of 2020 and a lot of these things we have always known but we are finally having an honest discussion about police and staffing, community policing and the consent to race.",602,,
2148,0.97,12826.58,12836.79,I want to focus my comments on moving forward and delivering concrete programs and concrete efforts to address what we have learned and what we need to incorporate in this budget.,602,,
2149,0.97,12836.79,12865.485,"I believe we have an opportunity, we have had an opportunity to hear from various committees, like safety, the chief of police, the court monitor and other folks about what this new Reimagined if you will police Department and community policing means, the relationship component of it.",602,,

2151,0.97,12888.008,12891.879,It is a work still in progress which I think people don't always understand.,602,,
2152,0.97,12891.879,12903.657,"I know that this whole counsel has always been mindful, particularly Councilmember Gonzalez who led us through this of the consent decree and what we are legally bound to do.",602,,
2153,0.97,12903.657,12908.695,What our responsibilities are and what our responsibilities are under the Seattle city charter.,602,,
2154,0.97,12908.695,12926.179,"We now understand and can see the impacts of the last couple years to less police officers and 911 calls, increase in gun violence, violence, crime and all the other things we hear about from our constituents everywhere across this great city.",602,,
2155,0.97,12926.179,12930.45,"And also, going back again as I shared last week talking about the letter that was written to all of us.",602,,
2156,0.97,12930.45,12943.897,Again the sentence that stuck out me to the most that letter dated November 10 is that we send the right people to the right calls and that is what has been missing in community policing.,602,,
2157,0.97,12943.897,12954.908,You are right Madam chair that everyone doesn't need to be met with a gun and badge and I appreciate that those type of values are now being translated into policy and now we are having the discussion on how we pay for it.,602,,
2158,0.97,12954.908,12987.307,"So, I am very supportive of this section of this because we are talking about a responsible restoration and we have to be mindful that we are still in transition from in the beginning, De-Fund the police to redirect funds from SPD to community and that we are in the process of creating and funding institutions that promote our goals and our values.",602,,
2159,0.97,12987.307,12990.344,"That we do no harm, that we protect and serve our city and its residents.",602,,
2160,0.97,12990.344,12999.953,I think that is the point we are at and I think Councilmember Lewis captured that quite nicely that this is a discussion that we have to have.,602,,
2161,0.97,12999.953,13003.523,Thank you for providing a safe space for us to have these discussions because they are difficult.,602,,
2162,0.97,13003.523,13016.069,"We are at the process and the threshold to direct money to the right programs and again, to direct the right people whether SPD, CSO's, the whole team to the right calls.",602,,
2163,0.97,13016.069,13019.272,And that takes time.,602,,
2164,0.97,13019.272,13045.365,"So, I'm going to Harken back to also the letter that we received on November 8. one of the sentiments that stood out to me the most, but in particular to what I'm speaking to now is when he said police reform and progress towards a more democratic and equitable police service requires investments in the system and infrastructure necessary to support that ideal.",602,,
2165,0.97,13045.365,13057.677,"So, that is where I will stand today in coming forward and promoting this to vote yes.",602,,
2166,0.97,13057.677,13060.58,We give grace and give time for us to change and grow.,602,,
2167,0.97,13060.58,13066.119,"As PD, community programs all need time to become a success.",602,,
2168,0.97,13066.119,13070.724,They are not going to happen overnight.,602,,
2169,0.97,13070.724,13072.192,And we all need time to heal.,602,,
2170,0.97,13072.192,13088.575,"So, again as I was sharing investing in upstream social programs, standing up to the SEC we need the correct funding in the Seattle police Department and these programs, this change takes time to take root.",602,,
2171,0.97,13088.575,13114.367,"As we streamline the Seattle police Department and fund Much- needed community programs that we now value and no, we need to give the same grace to change and to grow and that is why I am hoping that they would settle on this compromise.",602,,
2172,0.97,13114.367,13118.872,"With the knowing that CSO's are restored, thank you for your leadership and for listening Madam chair.",602,,
2173,0.97,13118.872,13136.923,If you listen to the community and concerns people had about the CSO's and again I want to say I think you have done a really good job of refocusing Úus and leading us through and sending out a format that allows us to have civil discourse and a way to disagree.,602,,
2174,0.97,13136.923,13143.797,And there is another day to come to get where we are going because I know we are going in the right direction.,602,,
2175,0.97,13143.797,13144.297,Thank you.,602,,
2176,0.97,13144.297,13151.905,Any additional comments or questions?,603,,
2177,0.97,13151.905,13154.407,"Sang no comments or questions, I appreciate the comments very much.",604,,
2178,0.97,13154.407,13159.513,I do have to encourage us all to remember that we are not out of this crisis and the pandemic has only worsened.,604,,
2179,0.97,13159.513,13186.139,We have seen growing and the crisis of Covid meant that we must preserve every dollar possible for the worsening scenario if we don't see businesses open as fast as we hope they will and we see a continued change or approach in the type of variance that Covid is presenting.,604,,
2180,0.97,13186.139,13188.241,We have to be prepared for the worst case scenarios.,604,,
2181,0.97,13188.241,13201.421,As the chart showed at the beginning of this presentation we have not nearly begun to build back our reserves past the level of support that we need to be at in order to be in a safe place for future downturn.,604,,
2182,0.97,13201.421,13209.763,I would encourage us to remain vigilant and not take from the reserves.,604,,
2183,0.97,13209.763,13219.339,"We need to have every investment possible at our fingertips so those who need care for Kiddos, Elders, food assistance, shelter, housing assistance that we have thought through what are the worst case scenarios.",604,,
2184,0.97,13219.339,13223.577,We have done a tremendous job in this budget of investing in immediate needs right now.,604,,
2185,0.97,13223.577,13237.857,I propose to you that having additional dollars go to areas within the Seattle police Department's budget do not compare to the type of needs that we may need to invest those dollars and in the future.,604,,
2186,0.97,13237.857,13243.597,We are already putting $4.6 million towards overtime bring the total to 26.4.,604,,
2187,0.97,13243.597,13252.539,We are already making sure that the travel and training budget has your $1 million in its in a time of Covid when there is less travel happening.,604,,
2188,0.97,13252.539,13263.583,We have Vigilantly looked at the actual data from attrition in past years to see what is a reasonable and frankly conservative expectation of how many officers will leave next year.,604,,
2189,0.97,13263.583,13275.729,"This is not to say that we want officers to leave when we have invested $750,000 into officer wellness and supervision to support retention that is included in the budget.",604,,
2190,0.97,13275.729,13283.937,"We have $218,000 to accelerate hiring training from civilian positions and to support recruitment.",604,,
2191,0.97,13283.937,13301.321,We can do these things and try to work towards greater retention but we should not be just looking at a piece of paper and changing the dollar amount that would have a dramatic affect on the reserves in front of us a $4 million.,604,,
2192,0.97,13301.321,13308.261,It is still a significant amount of money that I would like to see retained in our emergency funds to make sure if there is a crisis we are able to tap into those.,604,,
2193,0.97,13308.261,13314.434,"You heard how excited I was that I was able to add another 400,000.",604,,
2194,0.97,13314.434,13319.873,I would very much like to preserve this $4 million.,604,,
2195,0.97,13319.873,13327.18,"With that, I am urging a no vote on this item and look forward to further conversations about how we can make sure we are not in this cycle year after year.",604,,

2244,0.97,13523.376,13531.985,The Council balancing budget assumes 125 separations . The Department is saying there will be about 90.,619,,
2245,0.97,13531.985,13539.993,I think all of us acknowledge that both of those estimates are fair depending on a particular point of view.,619,,
2246,0.97,13539.993,13561.314,I think there is an advantage to budgeting to an estimate that assumes less attrition just so that we plan for that contingency and are not in a position where we need to Revisit in the middle of the year to adjust to make sure that the hiring plan doesn't just stop at a certain point if it does come in lower.,619,,
2247,0.97,13561.314,13578.131,"I think that there is nothing for the Council to lose in adapting this given that if the attrition is what the Council thinks it will be in the balancing budget, then these reserves never get touched anyway.",619,,
2248,0.97,13578.131,13584.637,It would essentially not touch the reserves in the case where the more pessimistic attrition scenario is realized.,619,,
2249,0.97,13584.637,13590.243,That is the essential thinking behind this.,619,,
2250,0.97,13590.243,13606.859,Generally going forward I would prefer if the Council not be in a position where we will habitually predict that hiring and separations would be the same number.,619,,
2251,0.97,13606.859,13610.063,"Again, this will be the second cycle in a row where we are doing this.",619,,
2252,0.97,13610.063,13613.967,"Again, I think it is certainly a respectable choice given the inconsistency year-to-year in what the attrition number is.",619,,
2253,0.97,13613.967,13624.243,"But I would prefer to assume the more optimistic attrition number and if that is not realized, the reserves won't be touched.",619,,
2254,0.97,13624.243,13630.483,We will be no worse for wear.,619,,
2255,0.97,13630.483,13630.883,Thank you.,619,,
2256,0.97,13630.883,13632.352,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",620,,
2257,0.97,13632.352,13636.789,I didn't quite understand the budget amendment.,621,,
2258,0.97,13636.789,13642.762,It says it cuts 2.7 million of the reserves.,621,,
2259,0.97,13642.762,13655.274,It doesn't say we might cut 2.7 million of the reserves if the separations are different.,621,,
2260,0.97,13655.274,13667.286,"So, I don't see this functioning as may be a proviso might function if written that way as the sponsor described.",621,,
2261,0.97,13667.286,13668.554,Maybe I am missing something here.,621,,
2262,0.97,13668.554,13669.789,I don't think you are.,622,,
2263,0.97,13669.789,13682.101,It does cut 2.7 million from the reserves and moves it to the Department budget.,622,,
2264,0.97,13682.101,13700.253,"It might be that what the council member Louis is referring to is that there is a salary savings proviso on all salary statements in SPD and if the money is not spent, then it is available to lapse at the end of the year.",622,,
2265,0.97,13700.253,13701.32,And go back to reserves.,622,,
2266,0.97,13701.32,13704.424,But I will let him speak to that.,622,,
2267,0.97,13704.424,13706.359,Thank you.,623,,
2268,0.97,13706.359,13710.93,You summarize what I was implying perfectly.,623,,
2269,0.97,13710.93,13714.233,"That said, I don't want to try to amend this On-The-Fly given the hour.",623,,
2270,0.97,13714.233,13719.672,But there will be other opportunities to discuss amendments.,623,,
2271,0.97,13719.672,13736.389,"If there is interest in structuring something more explicitly along the lines of a proviso like Councilmember Herbold just indicated, I'm happy to explore that off-line after today's meeting.",623,,
2272,0.97,13736.389,13749.936,But what I was alluding to Councilmember Herbold is that the 2.7 million would be captured by the savings proviso and it could be redistributed back into the stabilization fund when we Reapportion everything.,623,,
2273,0.97,13749.936,13754.574,"But yes, I see how that could have been misleading so I apologize for freezing it the way I did.",623,,
2274,0.97,13754.574,13758.478,No apologies necessary.,624,,
2275,0.97,13758.478,13771.09,"I haven't set it for about a half an hour, I am not voting in favor of anything that touches the reserves so I just wanted to really make sure that I understood this one correctly.",624,,
2276,0.97,13771.09,13771.491,Thank you.,624,,
2277,0.97,13771.491,13773.726,I had a similar message into my team as well.,625,,
2278,0.97,13773.726,13777.93,Thank you for the clarification.,625,,
2279,0.97,13777.93,13785.505,"Colleagues, are there additional comments or questions on this item?",625,,
2280,0.97,13785.505,13787.106,"Okay, I will offer a few additional comments.",625,,
2281,0.97,13787.106,13794.781,"Councilmember Lewis, I appreciate the recognition of the good work that central staff has done to do what I believe are accurate and conservative estimates of what attrition would be.",625,,
2282,0.97,13794.781,13803.856,I would just offer up again the information we received from central staff in October and the November memos we received.,625,,
2283,0.97,13803.856,13812.632,We know that this year we are on track to Unfortunately see a higher level of attrition than anticipated.,625,,
2284,0.97,13812.632,13817.703,Last year we assumed 114 officers would leave through attrition and we will probably see 150 officers leave through attrition.,625,,
2285,0.97,13817.703,13825.978,That is similar to the number we experienced in 2020.,625,,
2286,0.97,13825.978,13841.06,"I want to again reiterate the ways in which this counsel, even just in this midyear is helping to address retention issues as requested by the mayors issue.",625,,
2287,0.97,13841.06,13844.297,"Those items were not only funded in the midyear supplemental, they are included in the budget.",625,,
2288,0.97,13844.297,13856.676,They have not been touched and we will continue to uplift the information so it is very clear that we have as the Council President noted earlier this year in interest in what the Department is doing from the managerial side to address retention.,625,,
2289,0.97,13856.676,13858.411,We have put forward funding to address that.,625,,
2290,0.97,13858.411,13867.62,But the numbers bear out a much higher level of attrition than what the Mayor is suggesting.,625,,
2291,0.97,13867.62,13882.034,Assuming 94 officers will leave through attrition only is a very conservative estimate that quite literally would have left dollars on the table that could go into medical and mobile crisis unit lead programs.,625,,
2292,0.97,13882.034,13889.242,The community safety initiative that we heard so much about from the folks and so many other investments into food and safety and housing and shelter.,625,,
2293,0.97,13889.242,13891.244,Those are the decisions we made.,625,,
2294,0.97,13891.244,13913.165,I do want to make sure that we are very clear that 94 officers was a conservative assumption for attrition to begin with but we also have near 80 officers who have not received the vaccine who it is very likely are not going to have an accommodation made because of the nature of that work.,625,,
2295,0.97,13913.165,13928.18,"I know folks are working very hard to find accommodations for people who are not receiving the vaccine but if an accommodation cannot be provided for, a dozen out of the 80 will not be able to continue on and that is a conservative estimate.",625,,
2296,0.97,13928.18,13956.309,I very much appreciate the work that you have done with us to try to identify ways to invest in some of the most critical issues but for me I am pulling from the reserves even in the more Nuanced approach that you noted does not square with the experience that we have in attrition in the city of Seattle over the last two years and we will continue to work on retention strategies with the chief and the Mayor.,625,,
2297,0.97,13956.309,13970.489,"Colleagues, I would encourage a no vote on this item so that we can continue to see a healthy Reserve and will look forward to working with you all to keep our eye on those actual attrition levels with some of the other proviso languages that have been suggested.",625,,
2298,0.97,13970.489,13971.09,Any additional comments?,625,,
2299,0.97,13971.09,13981.834,"Hearing them, Madame clerk will you please call the roll on the adoption of amendment Spd-014-A- 001-2022?",625,,

2319,0.97,14036.422,14037.656,Okay.,628,,
2320,0.97,14037.656,14043.996,"My vote is no, Madame clerk.",628,,

2323,0.97,14062.014,14073.025,The motion carries and Spd-014- A-001-2022 is adopted.,630,,
2324,0.97,14073.025,14076.629,We will go on to the next agenda item.,630,,
2325,0.97,14076.629,14083.736,"Before that is read into the record, okay.",630,,

2328,0.97,14110.062,14113.132,"Yes, that is the next item on our agenda here.",631,,
2329,0.97,14113.132,14113.466,199.,631,,
2330,0.97,14113.466,14114.133,I apologize.,632,,
2331,0.97,14114.133,14115.768,It is too small to see.,632,,
2332,0.97,14115.768,14132.852,"Okay, the next item is Abrogating 101 police officer SPD to right size the salary budget.",632,,
2333,0.97,14132.852,14153.339,We have had a lot of discussion about how the proposed budget came over with 134 vacant police officer positions that were funded and that these vacant police officer positions that were funded are over and above the hiring plan that the executives submitted with the budget.,632,,
2334,0.97,14153.339,14199.818,"And that these vacant and funded positions, that the salary funding for them was redirected in the amount of 19 million redirected to other places in the budget, all of the many investments that we have been talking about and what this particular amendment is designed to do is to cut the vacant positions so that in future budgets, the executive can't send over a budget that has vacant positions that are funded with salary funding and then to redirect that salary funding to other priorities.",632,,
2335,0.97,14199.818,14207.76,"And this I think also speaks to chair, your principles about cutting versus ads.",632,,
2336,0.97,14207.76,14232.518,"If it is the case that the vacant positions that are currently receiving salary funding and then that salary funding is redirected, if that doesn't happen anymore, then it will be the case that the SPD budget will come forward with ads, the technology ads and the other ads will come forward as distinct ads.",632,,
2337,0.97,14232.518,14243.429,It won't be that they are paid for with salary funding from vacant positions and there won't be a lack of transparency there.,632,,
2338,0.97,14243.429,14247.466,That is the thinking behind this particular amendment.,632,,
2339,0.97,14247.466,14294.246,"It is not to in any way Abrogate filled police officer positions . One last piece of background I will provide is that if you examine the SPD staffing plan through the upcoming year and through 2023, the highest point that you will see in terms of having a need for sworn officers, the highest point is 1256 officers and that is the point in the number of officers or FTE that are left after 101 are abrogated.",632,,
2340,0.97,14294.246,14301.053,"So, this action can happen and not affect the SPD staffing plans for the next two years.",632,,
2341,0.97,14301.053,14319.271,"The only qualification I would make is if all of a sudden a police agency somewhere shut down and there were say 50 officers available to sign up in the middle of next year or more likely in the middle of the second year, the Council may have to take some action.",632,,
2342,0.97,14319.271,14335.187,"But, under the normal hiring plans of 125 next year and 125 year after, there should not be a need for 101 positions.",632,,
2343,0.97,14335.187,14340.659,So that is my summary.,632,,
2344,0.97,14340.659,14342.961,"Council President, I appreciate you bringing this amendment forward.",633,,
2345,0.97,14342.961,14346.398,Would you like to move adoption of this amendment?,633,,
2346,0.97,14346.398,14347.466,"I would, thank you.",634,,
2347,0.97,14347.466,14352.504,I move for adoption of Sdot-012- A-001.,634,,
2348,0.97,14352.504,14357.409,Thank you.,635,,
2349,0.97,14357.409,14358.61,It has been moved and Seconded.,635,,
2350,0.97,14358.61,14359.211,Please Council President.,635,,
2351,0.97,14359.211,14360.079,Thank you so much.,636,,
2352,0.97,14360.079,14367.186,My comments Unfortunately are a little bit longer on this one than I had originally intended.,636,,
2353,0.97,14367.186,14371.623,So I appreciate the grace from my colleagues to give slightly longer comments.,636,,
2354,0.97,14371.623,14379.298,I have been pretty quiet the entire budget committed process so hopefully this is acceptable.,636,,
2355,0.97,14379.298,14391.11,"When I was first preparing my comments to accurately describe this reasonable counsel budget action, as I mentioned I did it to make my comments pretty cut and dry.",636,,
2356,0.97,14391.11,14405.557,"However, at 2:18 PM today the interim chief of police issued to the media and the general public a statement that grossly Mischaracterizes the intent and effect of this proposed amendment.",636,,
2357,0.97,14405.557,14420.339,He did so without any outrage or communication with me or my office in advance though he directly references might amendment and only my amendment in his statement in spite of the fact that there are several other SPD amendments in today's votes.,636,,
2358,0.97,14420.339,14428.046,I am deeply disappointed in that tactic and find it Disrespectful.,636,,
2359,0.97,14428.046,14437.089,"Be that as it may, let me put the fear Mongering aside and misrepresentation of facts to bed.",636,,
2360,0.97,14437.089,14448.1,"Interim chief Diaz in his statement wrote ""that the Council President amendment will permanently eliminate another 101 officers.",636,,
2361,0.97,14448.1,14455.107,This would greatly jeopardize the safety of our communities and have long-term impacts on investigating violent crimes and caring for our most vulnerable host quote.,636,,
2362,0.97,14455.107,14464.249,"Again, either this is a gross and intentional misrepresentation or is a gross misunderstanding of the proposed amendment.",636,,
2363,0.97,14464.249,14475.761,"So, I would like to take an opportunity to Deconstruct that statement in the context of what is actually included in this proposed counsel budget action.",636,,
2364,0.97,14475.761,14484.236,"First, there is an inference in the interim chief's statement that the revised and actually balanced budget eliminates officers and that my proposed amendment would eliminate even more officers.",636,,
2365,0.97,14484.236,14484.937,This is inaccurate.,636,,
2366,0.97,14484.937,14503.655,"This budget fully funds SPD's sworn staff hiring plan and nothing in this budget or in my amendment proposes firing, laying off or otherwise eliminating funded and filled sworn officer positions.",636,,
2367,0.97,14503.655,14511.063,This is why it is incomprehensible to me as to why the interim chief would represent otherwise.,636,,
2368,0.97,14511.063,14525.577,"Second, the interim chief implies via his statement that this budget action would result in the firing, illumination or laying off of exactly 101 officers from the current police force.",636,,
2369,0.97,14525.577,14532.084,"Again, this is just not true.",636,,
2370,0.97,14532.084,14540.192,"This budget action would not impact the Seattle police Department's 2022 staffing plan as just described by Greg Doss, our independent counsel central staff analyst.",636,,
2371,0.97,14540.192,14544.096,Budget or operations in any way.,636,,
2372,0.97,14544.096,14547.165,Why wouldn't it create any impact?,636,,
2373,0.97,14547.165,14560.412,Because SPD's budget includes funding for 134 sworn officers above and beyond its already fully funded hiring plan.,636,,
2374,0.97,14560.412,14571.523,"To put it simply, SPD admits that they cannot and are not planning to hire these additional 134 sworn officers in 2022.",636,,
2375,0.97,14571.523,14572.324,Let me repeat that.,636,,
2376,0.97,14572.324,14584.269,Spd admits that they cannot and are not planning to hire these additional 134 sworn officers and 2022.,636,,
2377,0.97,14584.269,14608.527,"So, unlike any other Department in the city of Seattle, Seattle police Department expects the Council to look away and allow the Department to perpetuate the budget assumptions that results in every single year the Council being saddled with the responsibility of unwinding the police departments Nontransparent budget.",636,,
2378,0.97,14608.527,14616.134,"For the last two years most members, not all, but most members of this Council have committed to the principle of budget accountability for this police Department and all other police departments.",636,,
2379,0.97,14616.134,14616.468,Departments.,636,,
2380,0.97,14616.468,14628.48,I believe voting in favor of this budget action is in line with those budget accountability principles and hope the majority of you will agree with me today.,636,,
2381,0.97,14628.48,14639.391,"As I noted last week, I am reasonable and realistic and agreed that the Department does need some wiggle room which is why my budget action does not Abrogate all 134 positions.",636,,
2382,0.97,14639.391,14649.601,The interim chief is not asking the Council for a reasonable level of discretionary funding.,636,,
2383,0.97,14649.601,14652.404,He is apparently demanding a blank check and zero fiscal accountability or scrutiny.,636,,
2384,0.97,14652.404,14654.94,The Council should reject his demand.,636,,
2385,0.97,14654.94,14666.318,"At its core, my budget amendment is simply an effort to align the departments budget with the actual size of the force over the next several years.",636,,
2386,0.97,14666.318,14684.936,This revised position count would provide a buffer well above SPD's own optimistic staffing projections which by virtue of the last vote has just been made even more optimistic.,636,,
2387,0.97,14684.936,14693.645,With this counsel budget action the Seattle police Department continues to retain authority to hire the 1256 equivalents that the chief indicated he could hire in 2022.,636,,
2388,0.97,14693.645,14719.704,"And, the Seattle police Department has indicated that the Department would not need additional position of authority above the 1256 Full- time equivalents proposed with this amendment until the 2024 calendar year at the earliest.",636,,
2389,0.97,14723.942,14727.546,"I believe that this counsel budget action is an important cleanup action, good Governance and sound fiscal policy.",636,,
2390,0.97,14727.546,14757.676,"The passage of this counsel bill will ensure that the Council is right SIZING the Council's budget in future years starting with the proposed budget which should be built based on the funds needed to support its actual, not hypothetical, but actual staffing numbers and shouldn't include funding for over 100 vacant positions that the Seattle police Department has Unequivocably stated it cannot and will not be able to fill in 2022.",636,,
2391,0.97,14757.676,14774.192,And I want to reflect on the fact that the police Department is asking us to shelve these dollars for these positions that are not and cannot be filled in the context of a public health epidemic of one kind for this entire century.,636,,
2392,0.97,14774.192,14799.651,"If the Seattle police Department believed that they could indeed fill these 101 vacant and funded positions but unfilled positions, I trust that they would have included the entire 101 if not 134 positions in their staffing hiring plan but they did not.",636,,
2393,0.97,14799.651,14817.636,"So colleagues, I want to urge you to vote yes on Sdot-012-A- 001 and I appreciate Madam chair you giving me an opportunity to spend a little extra time than I would ordinarily spend to describe and make my case for adoption of the cement.",636,,
2394,0.97,14817.636,14822.874,Thank you Madam chair.,636,,
2395,0.97,14822.874,14828.146,Thank you very much Council President.,637,,
2396,0.97,14828.146,14847.866,"I really want to thank you for all of the work that you have done to provide clarity on what this amendment actually is related to 134 vacant positions that the chief, the Mayor and the Council agrees and has discussed will not and cannot and they are not planning to fill.",637,,
2397,0.97,14847.866,14859.211,These are separate from the 125 that both the Council and the Mayor's proposed budget AGREES we will attempt to fill fully funding the hiring plan.,637,,
2398,0.97,14859.211,14878.43,"I know this is a point of confusion for members of the community so what you have offered today is tremendous clarity along with central staff to ensure that folks truly understand these are not related to any existing positions, these are vacant and will plan to be vacant.",637,,
2399,0.97,14878.43,14880.632,Money is rolling over year after year for the positions.,637,,
2400,0.97,14880.632,14888.406,I appreciate the clarity you have offered.,637,,
2401,0.97,14888.406,14889.307,"Councilmember Herbold, go ahead.",637,,
2402,0.97,14889.307,14906.157,The comments that I want to share are not intended in any way to continue to spin and in accurate narrative.,638,,
2403,0.97,14906.157,14918.169,"I recognize the points that Councilmember Gonzalez has made about what it would mean to Abrogate these funds, or these positions and what it wouldn't mean.",638,,
2404,0.97,14918.169,14921.773,"Again, these are vacant positions.",638,,
2405,0.97,14921.773,14927.345,Counsel has removed funding from many of the vacant positions.,638,,
2406,0.97,14927.345,14947.499,And I appreciate her clarification of being in favor of this action and it has no impact whatsoever on the Department's ability to hire in a way that is consistent with its staffing plan.,638,,
2407,0.97,14947.499,14964.015,I am also frustrated with some of the rhetoric coming out of the executive Department and the police Department.,638,,
2408,0.97,14964.015,14970.522,I think another point of contention I have with the statement that I see chief Diaz put out.,638,,
2409,0.97,14970.522,14977.696,"He refers to the loss of 355 officers as a result of retirements, resignation and cuts.",638,,
2410,0.97,14977.696,14978.43,That is not true.,638,,
2411,0.97,14978.43,14995.947,We have not cut any of the 325 officers who have left the Department.,638,,
2412,0.97,14995.947,15028.98,"I feel I have a responsibility to do everything I can to make sure that people understand what the true action, the true impact of our actions are and also to do whatever I can to not encourage additional confusion to mislead the position of counsel as it relates to the Department budget.",639,,
2413,0.97,15028.98,15049.534,"And I am not saying at all that this is the intention of the sponsor but I am concerned that the budget action, I don't agree with the way it has been characterized by chief Diaz, I am concerned that it does send a message that the Council believes that the right number of officers for the Department is 1256 officers.",639,,
2414,0.97,15049.534,15063.314,"For that reason, I really am very concerned that at this time it would send that message to the public.",639,,
2415,0.97,15063.314,15071.523,And we have to recognize that I think our goals for standing up Nonpolice this crisis response have not been realized this year.,639,,
2416,0.97,15071.523,15072.791,It is not for lack of trying.,639,,
2417,0.97,15072.791,15082.033,We have seen the successful 2021 expansion of health one.,639,,
2418,0.97,15082.033,15083.935,We may not see the second expansion this year.,639,,
2419,0.97,15083.935,15092.444,I'm hoping we will but part of the reason for that is because of the loss of positions in the Seattle fire Department that would make it possible to do the second expansion.,639,,
2420,0.97,15092.444,15099.117,We have also successfully expanded the mobile crisis team's in the CSO expansion.,639,,
2421,0.97,15099.117,15126.177,But I think those Non-Crisis response is that we have been able to bring to bear this year are at a level that is commensurate with the budget action that we took in June or what we began discussing in June 2020 and finalized in August 2020.,639,,
2422,0.97,15126.177,15134.786,And that was at that point a goal of a reduction of 100 officers for the police Department.,639,,
2423,0.97,15134.786,15147.365,"And, again with the loss of police officers voluntarily leaving the Department, we are looking at that reduction of 100 officers.",639,,
2424,0.97,15147.365,15162.714,"We are now at a reduction of over 300, well, there have been over 300 separations, the size of the Department has been reduced I believe by about 280.",639,,
2425,0.97,15162.714,15172.524,"But Nevertheless, I just don't want to send the message inadvertently without having more time to really explain what this budget action would do.",639,,
2426,0.97,15172.524,15184.636,I don't want to send the message that we have come to the conclusion that 256 officers is the right size for the Department.,639,,
2427,0.97,15184.636,15194.112,There is a clear opportunity I believe for the new administration coming into office in 2022 to work with us here on counsel to provide accurate information for the public.,639,,
2428,0.97,15194.112,15203.721,And I very much look forward to turning the leaf to ensure that that happens.,639,,
2429,0.97,15203.721,15204.022,Thank you.,639,,
2430,0.97,15204.022,15206.024,"Thank you Councilmember Morales us, please go ahead.",640,,
2431,0.97,15206.024,15208.359,Thank you.,641,,
2432,0.97,15208.359,15229.981,"So, I think Council President Gonzalez did a great job of this Planing the issue that we heard from central staff earlier in the week about the 134 funded positions that are vacant in excess of the proposed funded hiring plan.",641,,
2433,0.97,15229.981,15245.897,What I really want to talk about is the matter of the opportunity cost for us as a city.,641,,
2434,0.97,15245.897,15254.906,The reason I am Cosponsoring this amendment is because of all of the needs that could be funded instead of funding 101 positions that SPD will not be able to fill this year.,641,,
2435,0.97,15254.906,15265.083,And remind us that the reason we had salary savings to capture for 2021 because there were funded pockets that sat vacant last year.,641,,
2436,0.97,15265.083,15270.521,"As the Council President said, a good Governance issue and an issue of transparency.",641,,
2437,0.97,15270.521,15287.739,"If we choose to allow the practice of funding at an extraordinary level four vacant positions that can't be filled, we are effectively allowing artificial expansion of the Department's budget and this is something that the Council has been doing for years now.",641,,
2438,0.97,15287.739,15292.744,We don't do this with other departments.,641,,
2439,0.97,15292.744,15295.913,"So, it is not clear to me why we keep doing it with this one.",641,,
2440,0.97,15295.913,15319.871,But the net effect is that we have a reduced general fund for all of our other city priorities and that has always been my point of view on this particular issue of trying to reduce the size of the force is that we really need to think about finding the scarce public resources to fund the really critical services that we have in the city.,641,,
2441,0.97,15319.871,15329.781,"And now, especially after Covid, that is even more acute of an issue.",641,,
2442,0.97,15329.781,15338.589,The 134 positions I think central staff said would be an out would be about $19 million.,641,,
2443,0.97,15338.589,15339.991,That is still leaving 33 funded.,641,,
2444,0.97,15339.991,15349.867,With that $19 million we could fund 57 units of permanent supportive housing.,641,,
2445,0.97,15349.867,15352.27,"100 home zones, 190 new Street outreach workers.",641,,
2446,0.97,15352.27,15362.547,These are the issues we keep hearing about and we don't have the resources to scale up all of that work that needs to happen.,641,,
2447,0.97,15362.547,15368.886,We could fund forgiveness for back rent approved during the pandemic for 3400 families.,641,,
2448,0.97,15368.886,15377.428,We could fund nearly 5 transitional housing sites like the one I proposed for the chief Seattle club that didn't get funded because we don't have the money.,641,,
2449,0.97,15377.428,15392.944,"With $19 million we could have fully funded my original amendments for youth preemployment funding, Afterschool programming for middle and high school students, community restorative justice programming, programming for black girls and Trans youth.",641,,
2450,0.97,15392.944,15398.85,A housing acquisition management program and still fund another six public toilets.,641,,
2451,0.97,15398.85,15403.154,So this is the issue for me.,641,,
2452,0.97,15403.154,15406.023,We have a Department that is bloated and has been for a while.,641,,
2453,0.97,15406.023,15410.461,And we have incredible needs in our community.,641,,
2454,0.97,15410.461,15412.063,This is just the list from my district.,641,,
2455,0.97,15412.063,15426.778,I'm sure that each of my colleagues could quickly write a list of $19 million worth of investments that their district could really benefit from.,641,,
2456,0.97,15426.778,15435.253,"So, however you want to couch it when we talk about community safety or public safety, we have to be talking about the balance and how we allocate our scarce public dollars to meet the needs in our community.",641,,
2457,0.97,15435.253,15440.424,We made some adjustments to the police Department budget and staffing.,641,,
2458,0.97,15440.424,15453.471,We funded CSO's and we are doing other important work to try to improve community safety and we could continue to invest in upstream solutions.,641,,
2459,0.97,15453.471,15460.411,"So, I know this isn't going to be the end of this conversation and we will be talking about this particular issue, my guesses for several years to come.",641,,
2460,0.97,15460.411,15488.806,"I want to encourage my colleagues not to think about this as some hot potato political issue, and really think about the kind of investments in our community that we could be making by shifting funding from the criminal legal system that doesn't serve our black and Brown neighbors to more upstream prevention services and Realy start to change the material conditions that our neighbors are living in.",641,,
2461,0.97,15488.806,15493.511,"So, I'm proud to be a cosponsor of this and I look forward to voting yes.",641,,
2462,0.97,15493.511,15500.351,Thank you Councilmember.,642,,
2463,0.97,15500.351,15502.286,"Counsel colleagues, are there any other comments or questions?",642,,
2464,0.97,15502.286,15507.058,"Councilmember Pederson, please go ahead.",642,,
2465,0.97,15507.058,15511.162,I have a question for central staff.,643,,
2466,0.97,15511.162,15518.769,How often does SPD update their staffing plan and their hiring plan?,643,,
2467,0.97,15518.769,15520.571,The department does it internally about once a month.,644,,
2468,0.97,15520.571,15536.387,They send it over quarterly according to the Sli that Councilmember Herbold has requested SPD 001.,644,,
2469,0.97,15536.387,15539.357,"So, the Council will receive quarterly presentations.",644,,
2470,0.97,15539.357,15540.791,They send it over informally more often.,644,,
2471,0.97,15540.791,15543.594,And I keep track of it.,644,,
2472,0.97,15543.594,15543.995,Thank you.,645,,
2473,0.97,15543.995,15556.307,We do have an incoming administration so there will be additional staffing plans and hiring plans that will be provided.,645,,
2474,0.97,15556.307,15559.81,It sounds like we don't really know exactly what the situation will be several months from now.,645,,
2475,0.97,15559.81,15580.831,"So, colleagues rather than cutting the currently vacant positions, I would urge us to instead focus on expanding reforms by revamping the police Union contract.",645,,
2476,0.97,15580.831,15582.166,The contract expired over a year ago.,645,,
2477,0.97,15582.166,15586.037,"As we know, the police Union contract governs financial issues such as premium pay and the definition of overtime.",645,,
2478,0.97,15586.037,15588.005,A better contract can also substantially strengthen accountability.,645,,
2479,0.97,15588.005,15599.817,"So, I believe revamping the contract that has expired continues to be the best path for us to work together with the Mayor's office and our accountability partners to make meaningful and durable progress.",645,,
2480,0.97,15599.817,15608.859,I will be voting no on this amendment to cut positions and I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no as well.,645,,
2481,0.97,15608.859,15611.362,Thank you.,645,,
2482,0.97,15611.362,15618.669,I don't see another hand so will offer some comments and then allow for the Council President to have the final closing comments here.,646,,
2483,0.97,15618.669,15619.971,These are not positions that are funded.,646,,
2484,0.97,15619.971,15622.573,These are not cuts to sworn officers.,646,,
2485,0.97,15622.573,15631.749,This is an amendment that recognizes that there are 134 vacant positions that every year rolls back into the Mayor's budget.,646,,
2486,0.97,15631.749,15655.006,That every year allows for them to have nearly $20 million to make decisions about where those dollars should go with in SPD without accurately recognizing that those dollars should go to the general fund for an informed conversation about how they could be allocated in the future.,646,,
2487,0.97,15655.006,15666.751,"If the Mayor wanted to this year put that $17.7 million into the general Fund and then had suggested in her proposed budget the ways in which to use it to go back into SPD, at least it would have been more transparent.",646,,
2488,0.97,15666.751,15688.305,It is not transparent not one every year these positions that are vacant continue to roll over year-to-year and that leaves us with the inability to have a transparent conversation with the community about how much money is actually going into salaries and officers.,646,,
2489,0.97,15688.305,15690.941,It is not accurate to say that these 134 positions are for officers.,646,,
2490,0.97,15690.941,15705.256,"These are vacant positions as central staff, our independent nonpartisan central staff has reiterated time and time again that both the Mayor, the chief and Council all acknowledge are not attempting to be hired.",646,,
2491,0.97,15705.256,15713.264,Every year those dollars will continue to roll over unless we Abrogate this position.,646,,
2492,0.97,15713.264,15715.866,I very much support the position offered.,646,,
2493,0.97,15715.866,15719.77,I support it because I think it is a good budgeting matter.,646,,
2494,0.97,15719.77,15737.388,"I support it because it also includes a cushion just in case by some stretch of the imagination the Seattle police Department is able to hit the 125 hiring goal that they have, they still have over 30 positions they would then be able to continue to hire for.",646,,
2495,0.97,15737.388,15743.727,It is not Abrogating every single one of those positions.,646,,
2496,0.97,15743.727,15766.884,"It is acknowledging that year after year we should not be in this position I do not want to have this counsel time and time again have to be subject to fear Mongering, and Browbeating when the reality is those $17.7 million should not have been allocated out to the programs that the Mayor had wanted to without a transparent number station first and have those dollars reflected in the general fund.",646,,
2497,0.97,15766.884,15784.935,"Regardless of your position on various policies as it affects policing, it is good budgeting practice to make sure that every Department does not have an inflated dollar amount tied to positions year after year when we know those positions are not going to be funded.",646,,
2498,0.97,15784.935,15789.54,We NOTE those positions are not going to be filled is what I meant to say and yet they are funded.,646,,
2499,0.97,15789.54,15793.11,That doesn't make any sense.,646,,
2500,0.97,15793.11,15806.857,Why would we allow for these positions to stay on the books to receive funding when we know they won't be filled.,646,,
2501,0.97,15806.857,15819.303,"When they have asked for the hiring plan that the police Department has asked for,",646,,
2502,0.97,15822.439,15834.485,It does not make sense to allow these artificially inflated salaries.,647,,
2503,0.97,15834.485,15856.273,"I appreciate that if we can support retention, mental health and well-being, and show that we are seeking to remove officers who are responding to homelessness crisis and mental health crisis, and folks who need access to shelter and services.",647,,
2504,0.97,15856.273,15861.679,Those are policy decisions that will continue and should continue.,647,,
2505,0.97,15861.679,15883.267,"This amendment is related to inflated budget tactics that keep the counsel in a defensive position every year, and it States what should be clear, plus I encourage you to support this regardless of your position on policy defenses that we may have had in the past.",647,,
2506,0.97,15883.267,15890.774,This is important for transparent and accountable budgeting matters.,647,,
2507,0.97,15890.774,15905.022,"I want to make sure that we have better clarity, this will absolutely help that, so we are not subject to fear Mongering and misinformation.",647,,
2508,0.97,15905.022,15907.658,Thank you for bringing this forward.,647,,
2509,0.97,15907.658,15913.03,"Thank you, chair.",648,,
2510,0.97,15913.03,15923.974,"I wanted to raise a point here, I will probably have to leave after this, so thank you.",648,,
2511,0.97,15923.974,15928.679,"Thank you, Councilmember Gonzales, please go ahead.",649,,
2512,0.97,15928.679,15936.186,"Thank you, Madam chair, for an opportunity to provide brief closing remarks in response to some of the debate here.",650,,
2513,0.97,15936.186,15954.471,"You know, I want to make it really clear this proposed budget action is not about whether or not we as a counsel believe this is the right number of officers and the right size for the police Department.",650,,
2514,0.97,15954.471,15981.231,"This is really a question about whether or not it is appropriate for a Department, the police Department or any other Department in the city to build the base budget on an assumption that is simply not true . and it is totally inflated.",650,,
2515,0.97,15981.231,15985.235,That is the case for the Seattle police Department.,650,,

2518,0.97,16007.324,16012.396,That does not prevent growth from occurring at the Seattle police Department.,650,,
2519,0.97,16012.396,16023.64,There is in fact nothing in this budget or my proposed amendment that prevents unexpected growth at the police Department.,650,,
2520,0.97,16023.64,16054.171,"Indeed is part of the reason why I only chose to put forward an amendment that would aggregate funded and vacant positions, so, let's do the math really quickly, allowing for reasonable growth, 125 positions, plus the 33 that continue to remain, for a total of 158 potential positions to be hired, next year, in 2022.",650,,
2521,0.97,16054.171,16077.428,"The alternative, if we reject this proposal, we will have a budget that indicates that the police Department can hire 125 police officers, which we have already funded, plus an additional 134 positions, for a total of 259.",650,,
2522,0.97,16077.428,16099.049,"Even in the most optimistic scenarios, the Seattle police Department never in its history of existence has hired 259 officers in a single year, or in a combination, for two or three years.",650,,
2523,0.97,16099.049,16147.331,"Again I appreciate that the next Council will have to have conversations about ongoing growth, about an accurate number of hires versus attrition, and, that is an important policy conversation for the Council to have . I want to make sure that we center the conversation not on policy questions, not being decided through budget action, but on whether or not it is appropriate for any administration, current or past, or future, to send the city council a budget, does builds a budget for a department around numbers that they know are not true, unrealistic, and unachievable.",650,,
2524,0.97,16147.331,16194.745,"I hope you would all agree that should not be the practice in terms of how to deal with budget, and you also see that I understand there is a need to have policy conversation around the future growth, and that nothing in this budget amendment ties the hands of this counsel to have the important policy conversation about the formula to identify the number of police officers that will be necessary to continue to deliver public safety services .
