70,0.97,632.698,634.834,Yes.,12,,
71,0.97,634.834,636.902,Okay.,13,,
72,0.97,636.902,639.472,Excellent.,13,,
73,0.97,639.472,644.51,Our equitable development initiative team leaned to the strategic fund process.,13,,
74,0.97,644.51,657.356,We stood up with community as advisement group that established priorities for the Rp consistent with the parameters for how the fund was established.,13,,
75,0.97,657.356,661.36,And that same community advisory group reviewed applications.,13,,
76,0.97,661.36,681.981,We have such an overwhelming response over a hundred applications we broke them out to four subgroups that reviewed a smaller number of applications and create add short list and that was brought together and reviewed by the group.,13,,
77,0.97,681.981,697.129,The focus was on real estate opportunities versus housing and cultural and community space to combat displace many and strengthen community relations and broke community wealth.,13,,
78,0.97,697.129,715.347,As all of you know the budget in 2021 was 30 million and we administered that process in coordination with a number of other departments and with Council.,13,,
79,0.97,715.347,729.061,"The 2022 proposed budget includes another 30 million which would be split, 14 million to go towards the team and 16 million to go towards the office of housing.",13,,
80,0.97,729.061,741.173,"Let me say a little bit more about that, if I could director Fernando.",14,,
81,0.97,741.173,741.74,Yes.,15,,
82,0.97,741.74,742.041,Absolutely.,15,,
83,0.97,742.041,750.216,2021 Thestream investment fund was funded from the one time proceeds of the sale of the locally known as the Mercer mega block.,15,,
84,0.97,750.216,757.99,That was one time source of flooding and community interest and the benefits and the list of projects we saw come forward.,15,,
85,0.97,757.99,768.067,There was a desire to continue investments of this form on an ongoing basis.,15,,
86,0.97,768.067,781.747,And what would saw was there was significant overlap between that interest and the Council's investment on the Edi Fund and housing being called out as jump start priority.,15,,
87,0.97,781.747,803.769,The budget proposes to do is the director describes the strategic investment fund proposal came along the lines of Edi projects in the community assets of various forms and opportunities to acquire property for affordable housing.,15,,
88,0.97,803.769,822.755,So budget--rather than continue the programs what the budget proposes to do is take $14 million and put it as ongoing support for equitable development initiative for the asset side of the investments and these projects.,15,,
89,0.97,822.755,840.873,That will be added to the base level funding coming from the short-term rental pack pushing the funding for Udi north of 20 million now.,15,,
90,0.97,840.873,842.641,Very significant and very importantly ongoing information.,15,,
91,0.97,842.641,858.924,"And the remainder, that was called out this morning from the Department of housing goes to affordable housing particularly projects that are focused on displacement.",15,,
92,0.97,858.924,870.836,Strategic opportunities to acquire land and potentially build projects that can mitigate the impact of Displacements in communities of color consistent with what is the goal of the strategic investment fund.,15,,
93,0.97,870.836,887.386,We are finding a way to make this ongoing program and to stream line it somewhat by placing it in the two departments that are correspond to the principle and the funding targets.,15,,
94,0.97,887.386,888.487,That is the budget background.,15,,
95,0.97,888.487,899.131,I don't know if you have comments as to where things are now.,15,,
96,0.97,899.131,899.431,I do.,16,,
97,0.97,899.431,905.337,And I would also think it is important to note.,16,,
98,0.97,905.337,952.184,"As you made reference to close $20 million we are talking about the 2022 allocation Sep dollars, we have had discussion internally in the office around is there an opportunity to look at the tier two applicants that were identified in both this year's Bdi process and as well as this year's strategic investment fund process.",16,,
99,0.97,952.184,963.996,"And in contemplating a one R P in 2022, could our primary outreach be those two tier applicants.",16,,
100,0.97,963.996,982.014,We can't get ahead of the community however we could establish a new process next year and I think there's some thought that we need to put into that since we have two bodies making decisions this year.,16,,
101,0.97,982.014,988.22,The strategic investment Fund and the advisory force and what is the relationship we want to set up next year.,16,,
102,0.97,988.22,1008.407,We need to hear from the community to get their input before we make any decision in that realm but I know there was support around cognitive support for the tier two applicants.,16,,
103,0.97,1008.407,1012.144,The status that you all know and I want to say thank you.,16,,
104,0.97,1012.144,1046.245,"I should say thank you to the CAG, to the Edi advisory board and to staff and to Council, you know, we have at least 13 project award related to the Sep strategic funds and will announce them on a rolling basis as contracts are in place so we don't complicate or make problematic the current real estate negotiations under way.",16,,
105,0.97,1046.245,1062.327,"And I thank you, of course, to all of you as the passing of the legislation this week so thank you for that.",16,,
106,0.97,1062.327,1063.462,And I think that covers my remarks.,16,,
107,0.97,1063.462,1075.674,"At the end, we can move to the next slide.",17,,
108,0.97,1075.674,1076.608,"All right, my slide is fairly easy.",18,,
109,0.97,1076.608,1083.816,A quick overview of where we are at to the equitable an community task force.,18,,
110,0.97,1083.816,1092.858,I think all of you know between the community leaders meeting from October to June.,18,,
111,0.97,1092.858,1100.699,Developed their recommendation and the area of small business education and health and housing.,18,,
112,0.97,1100.699,1121.153,And the 2021 budget and includes approximately 30 million for these endeavors and the Mayor's proposed 2022 budget includes another 30 million and ongoing investment that will go through departments that are going to implement the task force recommendation.,18,,

158,0.97,1595.026,1595.393,All right.,24,,
159,0.97,1595.393,1603.234,I can jump in deputy Mayor Washington.,24,,
160,0.97,1603.234,1603.668,If you would like.,24,,
161,0.97,1603.668,1608.206,We have interim director Chris Lumpbart for the community safety safety.,24,,
162,0.97,1608.206,1616.381,New Department and we have chief Herald Scott from the Seattle fire Department.,24,,
163,0.97,1616.381,1625.156,Both who have been integral in an alternate 911 response model that we include in the Seattle fire Department's budget.,24,,
164,0.97,1625.156,1640.305,We're quite excited about the pilot that we are hoping to Operationize at the beginning of 2022.,24,,
165,0.97,1640.305,1650.582,I would like to turn it to chief Scroggins to discuss the response model and how it fits into his unit.,24,,
166,0.97,1650.582,1650.815,Chief.,24,,
167,0.97,1650.815,1651.082,Sure.,25,,
168,0.97,1651.082,1660.959,"Thank you, Julie and the members of the Council for allowing us time to talk it through what we are looking at here.",25,,
169,0.97,1660.959,1668.066,What we size a lot of people that are in need.,25,,
170,0.97,1668.066,1673.171,But we need to take the time to see what they need.,25,,
171,0.97,1673.171,1679.744,The calls come through the 911 dispatch center and chief Lombard will talk about and the protocol and things like that.,25,,
172,0.97,1679.744,1687.052,But these are not people calling for a medical response or any type of critical emergency like that.,25,,
173,0.97,1687.052,1689.521,These are the welfare check calls and things like that.,25,,
174,0.97,1689.521,1714.079,"It may not sound like a lot but this equals almost 7000 times a year and maybe a bit more, just over 4100 calls Angelly and 2800 welfare checks annually and a few others that can be added in there as the model unfolds.",25,,
175,0.97,1714.079,1717.015,They are not the medical emergencies or Acutity emergencies.,25,,
176,0.97,1717.015,1730.829,We have taken the time to talk to our Pierce and talk to Washington D.C. and to Seattle and Oregon and to talk to or study what they are doing.,25,,
177,0.97,1730.829,1741.072,And so that led to our thought process in coming up with what we think is approach for helping you us through this challenge is that in front of us.,25,,
178,0.97,1741.072,1759.39,One of the things we would like to do is have people on the ground to have a conversation and build a relationship and to offer referrals to offer shelter and to offer--get in the navigation process and they can get help in connecting them with providers.,25,,
179,0.97,1759.39,1779.811,And these are not those 911 emergencies or low Acuity emergencies where we need that type of resource to Pu these are 7000 other calls that come in the system pretty consistently.,25,,
180,0.97,1779.811,1792.023,We are in the design process and chief Lombard will talk about the protocols that goes hand in hand to what we are talking about and I will pass it to chief Lombard.,25,,
181,0.97,1792.023,1795.426,Thank you very much.,26,,
182,0.97,1795.426,1803.968,There is some discussion with council as far as the wise the Seattle fire Department launching this unit.,26,,
183,0.97,1803.968,1807.205,We are six months away to considering doing this.,26,,
184,0.97,1807.205,1818.183,We hired our first hr director and still trying to--still Outsourcing the payroll and additional hr.,26,,
185,0.97,1818.183,1834.933,"And we don't have a fleet manager and knowing how important this is to us and important this is to Council, we would not even begin this initiative for no less than six to nine months away and it would still take time starting at that point.",26,,
186,0.97,1834.933,1847.645,This is why many of you received a letter from jointly authored from chief Scrog Girns and myself pointing out the facts if we want to get it going this is a good way to launch it.,26,,
187,0.97,1847.645,1856.988,"So chief Scroggins ports on the protocol system, one of the things that we found so far this year in analyzing how the calls are screened and Triaged.",26,,
188,0.97,1856.988,1875.373,There's some Consistencies and this has to to with just the turnover Dispatchers and how often and how fast we can train them and the fact that when beam are calling 911 they are not consistent saying I'm a 40- year-old male having chest pain.,26,,
189,0.97,1875.373,1878.876,They are traumatized and unfamiliar with what is going on.,26,,
190,0.97,1878.876,1882.08,It makes for difficult questions and answers between our call taker.,26,,
191,0.97,1882.08,1894.058,The hole is that with the protocol system that you authors in the Q2 supplemental and thank you very much for that.,26,,
192,0.97,1894.058,1904.502,We have found a protocol against all Dispatchers to allow us to do exhibit questioning and to wide out what is not medical.,26,,
193,0.97,1904.502,1908.339,A fire Department call and weed out an SPD issue.,26,,
194,0.97,1908.339,1917.749,Criminal in nature and identify that category in between.,26,,
195,0.97,1917.749,1933.164,The deep that chief Scroggins just referred to and so all Dispatchers can ask the same kind of questioning and we believe it will help the bias for screening and improve the consistency.,26,,
196,0.97,1933.164,1935.833,So the fact is that chief Scroggins or Julie?,26,,
197,0.97,1935.833,1936.234,Yes.,27,,
198,0.97,1936.234,1937.201,I will just add.,27,,
199,0.97,1937.201,1963.094,"As we design this, you know we are going to turn to what I would call our regional expert in John Airenfield as we put the design for this program to come together that is a good place to start because it is tied in with our emotional health unit.",27,,
200,0.97,1963.094,1983.014,Our high equalizer individual and facility program and health one program and there's case manager side and John and his team are tied to public partners around the community so they will be working to reduce duplication of other services offered.,27,,
201,0.97,1983.014,1984.015,That's another key we are focusing on.,27,,
202,0.97,1984.015,1989.754,I will stop there and hand it back to Julie.,27,,
203,0.97,1989.754,1993.424,"Thanks, chief and director Lombard.",28,,
204,0.97,1993.424,2001.499,The Mayor's 2022 proposed budget includes over $2 million for this new program.,28,,
205,0.97,2001.499,2025.957,And we will be the next administration can be poised to decide once this is up and running and see how this is working and the number of calls whether or not expansion is warranted and how quickly that can happen in 2022.,28,,
206,0.97,2025.957,2026.224,Okay.,29,,
207,0.97,2026.224,2028.459,Next slide.,30,,
208,0.97,2028.459,2049.48,"Some other additional, notable investments for the Mayor's 2022 budget in the police and criminal justice system for Seattle municipal court there is additional funding in 2022 for a case manager and seat community court that is a diversion court.",30,,
209,0.97,2049.48,2056.421,And there is some funding specifically directed for the domestic violence intervention process diversionary program as well.,30,,
210,0.97,2056.421,2061.025,I would add this is not additional or new money.,30,,
211,0.97,2061.025,2095.026,This is money from the human services division sort of pot of money for these types of programs that were specifically directing towards the domestic violence intervention process and double the current funding to subsidize electric home monitoring for Presentence and we can try to keep as many folks out of jail as possible.,30,,
212,0.97,2095.026,2113.578,"For the city's attorney 1.5 full-time employees are being add for $252,000 for diversion for young adults and adding additional 145,000 in 2022 for the firearms surrender project with the increase in gun crimes and gun violence.",30,,
213,0.97,2113.578,2122.153,We felt that was a worthwhile and worthy increase investment there.,30,,
214,0.97,2122.153,2125.523,Specific to the Seattle police Department.,30,,
215,0.97,2125.523,2144.675,"The 2022 budget of Mayor Durkan provides decision service units, Unsworn Seattle police Department employees who are key in the community interaction and the community phase for the Seattle police Department.",30,,
216,0.97,2144.675,2157.155,And we are also including money for Video analysts for police accountability to give them additional capacity and additional ability to assess Video.,30,,
217,0.97,2157.155,2171.102,A huge amount of Video that office of the police accountability have to go through and analyze and slice Township usable sections including body worn Video and police officer Dashcam Video.,30,,
218,0.97,2171.102,2188.019,There's also included some funding for hiring bonuses to assist with recruitment of additional officers as I'm sure you are all aware I have presented to the Council before we are in a sworn staffing crisis and the Seattle police Department.,30,,
219,0.97,2188.019,2209.14,"And in order to get up to minimum staffing levels to be diligent and thoughtful and deliberate about hiring and recruiting and most of the jurisdiction around Seattle and Washington state, the large ones offers these hiring bonuses.",30,,
220,0.97,2209.14,2217.048,Necessary for us to stay competitive for the best candidates.,30,,
221,0.97,2217.048,2232.697,"And all of those items together total and some additional ad hoc items the Mayor's budget increases the Seattle police Department 2022 budget by $248,000.",30,,
222,0.97,2232.697,2240.805,We are going to have an entire session to the last half of this session focused on SPD.,31,,

224,0.97,2241.172,2241.405,Yes.,33,,
225,0.97,2241.405,2259.991,There is another whole presentation on that so please NOTE if you have questions on SPD please hold those specific to the Department expenditures for the upcoming presentation that we will start in 45 minutes.,34,,
226,0.97,2259.991,2273.771,These were meant to give everyone a sampling of the range of items in the Mayor's budget.,35,,
227,0.97,2273.771,2274.071,Thank you.,35,,
228,0.97,2274.071,2274.972,Any closing words?,35,,
229,0.97,2274.972,2276.474,I see none.,36,,
230,0.97,2276.474,2322.353,I do want to turn it over to the chair public--Councilmember Herbold and vice chair of the committee and for a reminder for today's discussion the ladder half will be focused on SPD and we will take comments on the community safety and we know there is a loft Obviousl members that create some of these alternative funding strategies and the alternative service strategies and Councilmember Herbold appreciate your leadership on the efforts.,36,,
231,0.97,2322.353,2324.221,Focus on community safety.,36,,

233,0.97,2325.222,2325.656,I am wondering.,37,,
234,0.97,2325.656,2332.163,This may not be a problem for anybody else but me.,37,,
235,0.97,2332.163,2347.044,Could we maybe think about questions according to the sections that were--can we do the budget questions first and the strategic fund next.,37,,
236,0.97,2347.044,2354.618,Because I feel like it is going to be going all of the place.,37,,
237,0.97,2354.618,2364.195,And I won't be able to keep track of the questions I want to ask.,37,,
238,0.97,2364.195,2364.962,That's a great thing.,38,,
239,0.97,2364.962,2369.2,Why don't you kick us off.,38,,

241,0.97,2372.069,2373.637,That is in Councilmember Morales' Wheelhouse.,39,,
242,0.97,2373.637,2382.58,I don't have any specific comments about that.,40,,
243,0.97,2382.58,2395.226,And Madam--Councilmember Morales you are on mute and Councilmember Herbold if you wanted any comments you are welcome to do that at this time.,41,,

246,0.97,2402.5,2414.345,"And I just thought I would indicate and in case there were questions on the three bullets, all three of them are in Councilmember Morales' Wheelhouse.",42,,
247,0.97,2414.345,2414.712,Thank you.,43,,
248,0.97,2414.712,2420.151,"Councilmember Morales, please take it away.",43,,
249,0.97,2420.151,2420.785,Thank you.,44,,
250,0.97,2420.785,2423.554,"Well, I don't have questions.",44,,
251,0.97,2423.554,2442.239,I feel I live and breathe PB right now but I want to give my gratitude to the staff at och that have taken great pains to make sure they are engaging with community and with folks that are interested in the process.,44,,
252,0.97,2442.239,2446.777,Maybe not so interested but want to know more about what this process is intended to be.,44,,
253,0.97,2446.777,2472.036,They are being deliberate and intentional about reaching out to folks to help make sure that there is a deeper understanding and I think it is important to acknowledge that they are turning a community demand as director Lockhart said to axle process that city will benefit from in the future.,44,,
254,0.97,2472.036,2495.292,So I am glad to hear that staff is engaged and and folks coming on board at the end of October and I want to appreciate the acknowledgment from the executive office that this should be a part of the regular budgeting process for now on.,44,,
255,0.97,2495.292,2524.421,We are trying to grow this and I am thinking of this first year as sort of test case to see what works and what doesn't work and how we do the process and I am excited about the process and look forward to incorporating this as a regular way of doing business so we can share power and decision making with our community members.,44,,
256,0.97,2524.421,2528.759,And I'm looking forward to the process.,44,,
257,0.97,2528.759,2529.093,Excellent.,45,,
258,0.97,2529.093,2529.393,Thank you.,45,,
259,0.97,2529.393,2533.898,"Councilmember Herbold, I just want to pause with the orientation that you gave.",45,,
260,0.97,2533.898,2536.166,I saw a hand from Councilmember Lewis.,45,,
261,0.97,2536.166,2544.375,Want to make sure your hand was not related to these first three bullets and if so we will put you in the Cue for the next item.,45,,
262,0.97,2544.375,2547.578,I'm for the next item Madam chair.,46,,
263,0.97,2547.578,2552.016,Thank you very much.,47,,
264,0.97,2552.016,2558.055,Okay Councilmember Herbold thank you so much.,47,,
265,0.97,2558.055,2559.123,All right.,48,,
266,0.97,2559.123,2559.356,Great.,48,,
267,0.97,2559.356,2611.342,"As far as framing remarks and I will have questions as well as the SPD but first off I want to appreciate the work of the Department in conceiving of and setting up this new faith and thriving community division in response to the need to improve community safety and thrilled that we have division director REX Brown on board and thanks to the staff for your comments on this short period of time and appreciate hearing Inspector Brown about the fact that lead funding, the additional funding for 2021 is imminent.",48,,
268,0.97,2611.342,2617.948,And the amendment is under way and it is great to hear that.,48,,
269,0.97,2617.948,2626.49,I have a couple of questions related to this particular division.,48,,
270,0.97,2626.49,2643.674,"And I think we will get, if it is okay with you, we will get the questions I have and we will move on, is that okay?",48,,
271,0.97,2643.674,2646.744,That's great.,49,,
272,0.97,2646.744,2654.818,We have heard obviously from central staff and the community safety initiative.,50,,
273,0.97,2654.818,2682.513,$4 million that Council provided in 2020 to establish and operate the safety Hub in specific geographical area and funding was carried forward to 2021 because it was not spent in 2020 and currently supporting the Hub.,50,,
274,0.97,2682.513,2706.136,We have informed yesterday and I was hearing that we couldn't find it in the budget and we believe it was in the Mayor's proposed budget and I learned that is not the case and looking to signal my belief that really high priority for me and hopefully for my colleagues on the 2021 budget.,50,,
275,0.97,2706.136,2728.459,I want to highlight and appreciate the fact that the funding and Mayor's proposed budget for the one call pilot that was ongoing pilot crisis connection.,50,,
276,0.97,2728.459,2728.692,Again.,50,,
277,0.97,2728.692,2746.543,"It is really critical to Reimagining community safety work and then for folks that don't know what that is, it is a dedicated line for the fire Department and other emergency medical responders for medical alert crisis.",50,,
278,0.97,2746.543,2771.168,"For somebody for the first responders to call and to get referrals, say, a police officer calls the one call pilot, when they arrive on the scene and can be connected with the behavioral health expert and provide guidance around that particular individual's need.",50,,
279,0.97,2771.168,2772.503,It is important effort.,50,,
280,0.97,2772.503,2779.209,And asked for additional year as the pilot for their evaluation.,50,,
281,0.97,2779.209,2788.085,So really pays that is included.,50,,
282,0.97,2788.085,2798.762,"And Lastly I want to make note that there is an important priority for me and this Council, we have on two consecutive years.",50,,
283,0.97,2798.762,2816.914,"Well, I think it was actually in two years over a three-year period of time maybe, expressed our intention to fund lead to scale.",50,,
284,0.97,2816.914,2825.055,We have passed legislative intent and funding in the 2021 budget was about $6 million and we added 3 million.,50,,
285,0.97,2825.055,2828.859,We talked about that added three million earlier.,50,,
286,0.97,2828.859,2850.747,And last Friday my safety services committee heard a presentation on the study that was requested by a statement of intent and what it would take to fund the league except what are called very qualifying referrals.,50,,
287,0.97,2850.747,2865.162,And what the funding would need to get to scale by 2023 and how close to this commitment in 2019 when we pass revolution 31916.,50,,
288,0.97,2865.162,2884.448,I'm looking forward to conversations by colleagues on the right way to scale and later in the budget cycle in 2023 but for right now my question is how much budget is proposed for the 2023 budget?,50,,
289,0.97,2884.448,2888.819,Director noble I saw your hand.,51,,
290,0.97,2888.819,2899.229,I thought you had a clarification.,51,,
291,0.97,2899.229,2905.335,But let's take the lead answer first.,51,,
292,0.97,2905.335,2907.337,Let not all speak at once.,52,,
293,0.97,2907.337,2909.239,I don't know if he does.,53,,
294,0.97,2909.239,2913.043,We can return with detail.,53,,
295,0.97,2913.043,2921.718,It is the base budget with the Awi.,54,,
296,0.97,2921.718,2928.258,I will try to get that for you.,55,,
297,0.97,2928.258,2935.265,So no increase over what was approved last fall for 2021.,56,,
298,0.97,2935.265,2935.599,Correct.,57,,
299,0.97,2935.599,2937.567,Okay.,58,,
300,0.97,2937.567,2946.743,And we will check because we want to be sure go ahead.,58,,
301,0.97,2946.743,2956.186,"6.3 million, our Finance people are listening.",59,,
302,0.97,2956.186,2957.321,Thank you.,60,,
303,0.97,2957.321,2962.259,Director noble did you have something to say.,61,,
304,0.97,2962.259,2963.06,Yes.,62,,
305,0.97,2963.06,2968.165,Councilmember Herbold is pointing this out.,62,,
306,0.97,2968.165,2970.067,But this was an oversight and not a conscious choice.,62,,
307,0.97,2970.067,2994.558,We have a path given the amount of funding and additional funding provided a little bit of reserve that we're holding I believe we have a path forward to fund that and we will provide to it central staff and corrections to the budget.,62,,
308,0.97,2994.558,2998.395,And that was not intended.,62,,
309,0.97,2998.395,3001.131,There is a lot for the budget.,62,,
310,0.97,3001.131,3006.303,And again I think we have a a path forward.,62,,
311,0.97,3006.303,3008.438,Appreciate it.,63,,
312,0.97,3008.438,3013.443,"Alley, do you have something to add?",64,,
313,0.97,3013.443,3028.859,I just want to acknowledge that we thought we had correct information and I apologize and sent it out to everyone and clarified it.,65,,
314,0.97,3028.859,3032.162,And all of committee with options.,65,,
315,0.97,3032.162,3037.3,Councilmember Herbold more comments on that item from you?,66,,
316,0.97,3037.3,3038.168,Okay.,66,,
317,0.97,3038.168,3040.036,Colleagues any thing additional.,66,,
318,0.97,3040.036,3048.211,"Would you mind putting up slide number one, one more time?",66,,
319,0.97,3048.211,3055.552,Any additional questions or comments.,67,,
320,0.97,3055.552,3069.699,"Thriving safe communities and a full page on slide number six, any decision comments on thriving safety communities?",67,,
321,0.97,3069.699,3079.009,"Patty, would you mind going to slide number nine.",68,,
322,0.97,3079.009,3087.584,Slide number nine that is the alternative response model and Councilmember Herbold back to you.,68,,
323,0.97,3087.584,3088.018,Thank you.,69,,
324,0.97,3088.018,3131.361,Thank to you interim director Lombard and Scroggins for your work to stand up the community center and appreciate that budget documents says that the Department envision provides community base services and solutions to community safety challenges and want to recognize that while the Department is currently home to 911 dispatch it is my vision and one that we share that the new defendant is the home of solutions for community safety challenges.,69,,
325,0.97,3131.361,3163.093,I appreciate how that is best to work with the fire Department given some of the challenges for SPD and really hoping that we can chart a path to make it possible for the home of the triage one response unit.,69,,
326,0.97,3163.093,3173.27,And I appreciate that it would take more time if it was developed out of Cscc.,69,,
327,0.97,3173.27,3180.277,I had previously a few weeks ago requested two different Timelines.,69,,
328,0.97,3180.277,3187.584,A Timeline is triage one is being stood up and a Timeline for Iffire is standing it up.,69,,
329,0.97,3187.584,3217.847,I believe what central staff heard it won't take more time but more resources for it to be stood up by Cscc because of many of the things that you identified around the human infrastructure that needs to be in place over in your shop.,69,,
330,0.97,3217.847,3253.216,Wanting to provide that for some framing and glad we are able to move forward on the many new pro to COM systems and I hear folks say setting up the system goes with the development of triage one but my understanding is that new protocol system needs to be in place and people need to be trained on it before we are able to triage one.,69,,
331,0.97,3253.216,3261.458,Really appreciate that the Council had the opportunity to work with you to fund that element sooner.,69,,
332,0.97,3261.458,3274.671,This year instead of waiting for the passage and implementation of the 2022 budget in January.,69,,
333,0.97,3274.671,3277.173,"A couple of questions, if I may.",69,,
334,0.97,3277.173,3300.797,"Back in last year's budget we had asked a question around whether or not there were benefits or costs of merging and or Colocating the fire Department, 911 center and the Cscc call center.",69,,
335,0.97,3300.797,3345.875,And the executive response concluded that would take additional community in put and a million dollar endeavor and further note that consolidation is not feasible in the short or immediate time and possibly one location to be out of service for any reason and I am just wondering whether or not the budget includes any funding for technical and operation study for the answers to some of these questions and whether or not such a study could include further exploration of integration of the call center.,69,,
336,0.97,3345.875,3388.451,"That is one question and then the question I asked about the Nick, Jr. briefing relates to the fact that there was some disagreement from executive about the content of the Nick Junior conclusion and there was a desire of the executive to check some of the Nick Junior assumptions around call sites and agreement that 28 call sites did not need SPD response and there was reference to the fact that in I think the term was very near term we could look at alternate for SP D for those call times.",69,,
337,0.97,3388.451,3408.838,"That is calls for service and it counts for 23,000 service hours but what we have with triage one is a small fraction of those 142 service hours.",69,,
338,0.97,3408.838,3440.57,"I am just wondering to understand again consider that this 12% was identified as a--that we could identify an alternative in the near term for that 12%, what is our plan--I think it is six times the number of service hours that triage is planning on taking up?",69,,
339,0.97,3440.57,3444.774,Thank you Councilmember for your questions and your observations on the growth and this extension center.,70,,
340,0.97,3444.774,3454.25,"We have learned phenomenal lessons in the last two years from the growth and development of the triage one system, what it took to get it off of the ground and what made it work and click.",70,,
341,0.97,3454.25,3470.834,And how it has been expanding as you know or as Councilmembers know we are getting ready to launch the third of the help one units starting this fall and what not and phenomenal feedback and lessons learned.,70,,
342,0.97,3470.834,3477.407,"So our approach is to follow the same call, walk, run type approach.",70,,
343,0.97,3477.407,3489.953,We agree that there will most likely be more than the approximately 7000 calls identified in the person downtown in the welfare checks.,70,,
344,0.97,3489.953,3510.84,"But beyond those to relate to the 91 calls for Nick Junior work, some will be a little more nuance as far as the kind of neutral and kind of like maybe triage one in police, we figure with the 7000, that those were very clear-cut.",70,,
345,0.97,3510.84,3520.149,And ones that we know today with high levels of confidence that fall in this middle territory.,70,,
346,0.97,3520.149,3542.438,"Andean going back to the crawl walk run approach, in the scale ability for getting the program up and running and being able to identify stuff that we know right now today that we could start sending triage units to go investigate and that is why we limited it to the two calls.",70,,
347,0.97,3542.438,3549.178,It was not to be inclusive but to get the program up and running.,70,,
348,0.97,3549.178,3561.257,"So this $2,150,000, is that just for the crawl com Poe incident or is that for a crawl, walk, run or Scaling under.",71,,
349,0.97,3561.257,3563.66,I would say that is the crawl walk portion of it.,72,,
350,0.97,3563.66,3607.737,"As we get into a couple of these units out there and the crawl walk portion, we will learn Exponentially with the triage and the health program, the two million will get us the first--we budgeted the first three units out there and I think by that point we will definitely be Transitioning to the running phase and keep using the analogy to identify the calls we have and what more Christmas they can take and pair off the additional call types.",72,,
351,0.97,3607.737,3621.117,The protocol system that we have started to work on is an examination of the different call types that SPD has within the CAD system.,72,,
352,0.97,3621.117,3631.794,Currently there is over 300 different call types and you Referenced 98 of them and this is excessive for what other departments in the region have.,72,,
353,0.97,3631.794,3646.509,Part of the protocol system would do a deep scrub to find out how many of the different types that we have are redundant and how many are nuances of each other and what not.,72,,
354,0.97,3646.509,3648.745,We got the list.,73,,
355,0.97,3648.745,3654.117,There is a lot of them.,73,,
356,0.97,3654.117,3655.685,It is 28 call types.,73,,
357,0.97,3655.685,3660.323,"That both Mick, Jr. and the executive agree don't need police.",73,,
358,0.97,3660.323,3665.561,We have central staff that have made a request for the names of those 28 call types.,73,,
359,0.97,3665.561,3683.579,"Just so we can be a the same page and my other question was about the efficiencies, locating them, is there any resources to study that issue?",73,,
360,0.97,3683.579,3690.053,I will defer to director noble but I believe we did not include that.,74,,
361,0.97,3690.053,3706.436,"Looking in the region, South 911 and down in Pierce County just built a brand new facility, $65 million and they Consolidated several of the Psaps.",74,,
362,0.97,3706.436,3714.41,We knew numbers to any consolidation would push close to the one hundred million range.,74,,
363,0.97,3714.41,3722.819,And taken I will defer to director noble but I don't believe we had budgeted for a study on that.,74,,
364,0.97,3722.819,3727.223,"Director noble, do you want me to address that?",75,,
365,0.97,3727.223,3727.523,Please.,76,,
366,0.97,3727.523,3767.463,"So Councilmember Herbold, one of the things that was sort after prerequisite in our determination to begin such a study was to have Cscc have their feet under NEM be stood up and have them operational as a solo unit for a while to make assessment operating on best facts so we understood what the Department would look like and potentially, if there was interest then talk about funding a study for consolidation.",77,,
367,0.97,3767.463,3773.836,We didn't thing it was a response model that was set up for the protocol system.,77,,
368,0.97,3773.836,3781.41,That was a realistic thing for 2022 to especially put in that the budget.,77,,
369,0.97,3781.41,3791.687,I think we wanted Cscc to field themselves more and before we two down that road.,77,,
370,0.97,3791.687,3797.16,I hope answers your question and now the 28 call times.,77,,
371,0.97,3797.16,3832.228,"The Cscc and the Seattle police Department are going to work closely in figuring out, you are right, triage one is a small portion of those potentially and the Seattle police Department is working currently and I believe in their presentation Dr. fish Ler be on and can give you more details but doing a risk Trophy' to figure out of the 28 calls how we use the new protocol system to drill down and identify which of the calls do not need a sworn officer.",77,,
372,0.97,3832.228,3839.869,The Nick Junior report was the ten thousand foot initial Blush of the types of calls that we should be looking at.,77,,
373,0.97,3839.869,3843.973,And Seattle police Department has taken that list and running wit to make that determination.,77,,
374,0.97,3843.973,3857.086,That is going to involve speaking with the city attorney's office and there are statutes that Lim who can and can't respond to certain types of calls.,77,,
375,0.97,3857.086,3860.523,And it will take us delving into the call times.,77,,
376,0.97,3860.523,3888.117,"Disturbance, a lot of them don't need a sworn officer to respond and a lot of them do and we have to figure out how to Parse out which ones are which to identify what this universe is but Seattle police Department is working on that with the help of CSC C and the new protocol will be helpful.",77,,
377,0.97,3888.117,3894.523,If you have more questions I would defer you to Dr. Fisher.,77,,
378,0.97,3894.523,3897.193,& lt; & lt; I spoke to Dr. Fisher periodically.,77,,
379,0.97,3897.193,3910.172,"I was under the impression that there is a set of calls that there is agreement with Nick, Jr. that they were doing the risk assessment on and I was under the impression that was not the case for the 28 calls.",77,,
380,0.97,3910.172,3922.852,For the 28 calls it was we agree those are calls that we want to do the risk assessment because the Nick Junior approach did not say 12% that is where there is agreement.,77,,
381,0.97,3922.852,3932.662,The Nick Junior report says 50% of calls and SPD was like I'm not quite sure that is going to work.,77,,
382,0.97,3932.662,3933.796,I will direct those questions more to Dr. Ficker.,77,,
383,0.97,3933.796,3944.907,I think this is a good sign for the issue that will coming up.,78,,
384,0.97,3944.907,3958.054,"Obviously member Lewis, you have your hand E your hand up.",78,,
385,0.97,3958.054,3967.096,Go ahead.,78,,
386,0.97,3967.096,3984.113,I would judge ask if these are city employees instead of being provider based like Star or ca hoots or some of the other response systems.,78,,
387,0.97,3984.113,4015.211,And I bring that up just because the low Acuity response that Councilmember Herbold and I were in cited that there were advantages to having a Nonunion formed response that can help put folks more at ease when they respond and it doesn't feel as sort of official and that can be helpful to be rapport with people that are resistant.,78,,
388,0.97,4015.211,4039.535,And looking at a way to emulate that kind of division and in the alternative if we could have another contract to respond to go into our cornucopia of response options response to tree am one and perhaps as we continue to do the analysis that Councilmember Herbold just discussed in regards to continuing to analyze different calls.,78,,
389,0.97,4039.535,4052.114,I wanted to throw those questions out and to see to what extent this is considered.,78,,
390,0.97,4052.114,4056.719,"Thanks, if chief Scroggins or Lombard want to weigh in, that is great.",79,,
391,0.97,4056.719,4071.267,We are working on the staffing approach for the triage team with labor and important that we work with labor on it and developing who the folks are that are going to be staffing the triage team.,79,,
392,0.97,4071.267,4081.811,So I'm--without--I think there is a lot more negotiations that we need to work closely on with the development teams and I will leave it at that.,79,,
393,0.97,4081.811,4087.817,I think we were looking regardless.,80,,
394,0.97,4087.817,4097.526,"Whether it is--depending on which labor organizations we were trying to shoot for them being city employees one way, shape, form or another.",80,,
395,0.97,4097.526,4115.945,"To your point Councilmember, we notice that the ca hoots program, that is one of the things that we heard as well, whether it was volunteer or whether it was contracting out that it was difficult for them to maintain the consistency that we are hoping for in Seattle.",80,,
396,0.97,4115.945,4118.914,Thank you very much interim director.,81,,
397,0.97,4118.914,4120.583,Any other questions on this slide.,81,,
398,0.97,4120.583,4133.395,We only have one more slide and we about on time and we have 20 minutes to the remaining Hour- And-A-Half about SPD.,81,,
399,0.97,4133.395,4153.182,I think Councilmember Lewis point I would like a response that these are city employees then I think there are benefits for them to be city bees because of the stability of the work force that city of Seattle can offer.,82,,
400,0.97,4153.182,4194.356,"But what I heard when people show up in uniforms even if they are not police uniforms, that might create barriers to develop a relationship and want to have some acknowledgment that we are hear that and that is something that is part of the conversation is how people if they are city employees presenting on the scene.",82,,
401,0.97,4194.356,4194.957,Any additional response?,83,,
402,0.97,4194.957,4208.003,All things on the table and we need to work with the unions this is their current body of work on what that will look like and how we will move forward with this.,84,,
403,0.97,4208.003,4217.446,I will ask one final question on this slide.,85,,
404,0.97,4217.446,4235.531,I want to know how quickly the mental health calls will be sorted out?,85,,
405,0.97,4235.531,4239.001,To a Nonspd response?,85,,
406,0.97,4239.001,4247.843,"Again, the protocol systems, we anticipate Mayor assigns in the last two weeks the do that gives us the funding for the protocol system.",86,,
407,0.97,4247.843,4262.291,And so we will be able to I believe it is the city rules and rates one month before we can actually start working on that beyond conceptual ideas.,86,,
408,0.97,4262.291,4288.817,When we work on the protocol and the mental health it will be part of the protocols and what we can identify and working with the program that has case management and some of the city departments to find and identify those mental health practitioner resources to assign the calls to.,86,,
409,0.97,4288.817,4305.934,And Plentily there are not a whole lot of resources that are Dispatchable from the 911 paste that will have some kind of mobile computer in the vehicle waiting for a mental health call to go to.,86,,
410,0.97,4305.934,4324.653,We are trying to work through that as well and to try to find how do we best assign and match up the incoming calls for help with the appropriate resource that exists and if doesn't try to better scope that call.,86,,
411,0.97,4324.653,4333.962,Thank you for that and look forward to hearing more information about the protocols.,87,,
412,0.97,4333.962,4334.53,For mental health calls.,87,,
413,0.97,4334.53,4340.402,Let's move to the last slide and see what additional questions we may have.,87,,
414,0.97,4340.402,4340.703,All right.,87,,
415,0.97,4340.703,4359.288,"So maybe just the first two categories if we can put SPD questions for the next presentation to come and Councilmember Herbold, your up.",87,,
416,0.97,4359.288,4361.557,Thank you.,88,,
417,0.97,4361.557,4372.434,So I have a question about the project and the diversion program in the city attorney's office.,88,,
418,0.97,4372.434,4390.619,I just want to reference that and there is a request that I'm aware of from judge Eisenberg at Seattle municipal court for this program and my understanding being funded.,88,,
419,0.97,4390.619,4397.96,It is a court program and being funded through Hsd.,88,,
420,0.97,4397.96,4409.304,And it is not my question but correct me if I am wrong when I get my question out.,88,,
421,0.97,4409.304,4427.089,I am curious how we will make the connection of this project and recommendations that we received from the criminal system task force on diversions generally.,88,,
422,0.97,4427.089,4451.68,They have principles that they would like us to apply for the program and avoiding the coercive filing part of the continuum and not representation an expansion of the criminal legal system.,88,,
423,0.97,4451.68,4472.801,If you are adding funding for this project and having the source of the funding come from somewhere else in the criminal justice system is important for the task force.,88,,
424,0.97,4472.801,4509.404,"Just requesting that this program have these principles embedded and just want to note that slide indicates that they have 350,000 in the proposed budget and the notation and budget document Notifies a competitive diversion plan, are they being asked to apply for their funding through a competitive Rsp or is the funding guaranteed and is the maximum reward be the requested amount?",88,,
425,0.97,4509.404,4512.908,I will pause on that question.,88,,
426,0.97,4512.908,4515.944,I don't know if REX is still available or not.,89,,
427,0.97,4515.944,4525.287,I am not comfortable totally answering that question because I don't think I know the answer to it.,89,,
428,0.97,4525.287,4528.457,I will have to circle back around on that.,89,,
429,0.97,4528.457,4537.533,My understanding that this was not asking them to apply for an RS P and directed funding is my understanding but we will find out the answer.,89,,
430,0.97,4537.533,4547.943,Rex is here with us.,90,,
431,0.97,4548.61,4550.579,He may know.,91,,
432,0.97,4550.579,4551.38,Thank you so much.,92,,
433,0.97,4551.38,4569.698,I think there is a small error here and we have had some clarification from CPO and I would like to get back to you later on that just to make sure we are all on the same page.,92,,
434,0.97,4569.698,4570.132,That's great.,93,,
435,0.97,4570.132,4573.235,Figure it out together.,93,,
436,0.97,4573.235,4576.972,And I will get back to you.,94,,
437,0.97,4576.972,4579.675,If you have another question can you make it short?,95,,
438,0.97,4579.675,4584.279,We want to get to the President before the 3:30 mark.,95,,
439,0.97,4584.279,4612.04,"The Prefiling version for young adults, we received a presentation from the city office and the city a couple weeks ago and this was the presentation was on a tool kit on expanding the existing--an existing type of program that doesn't have to be 180 but a program like choose 180 and expanding it to adults over 25.",96,,
440,0.97,4612.04,4629.157,Just wanting to know why the funding for that was not included in the budget considering the work that the city is doing on that expansion.,96,,
441,0.97,4629.157,4645.807,Resources are limiting and placed on the available resources and gin the upcoming election and there is a new city attorney and wasn't clear what the direction would be from the city's attorney office more generally going forward and beyond.,97,,
442,0.97,4645.807,4653.248,That may become more clear and in a different position.,97,,
443,0.97,4653.248,4657.185,We were faced with that uncertainty.,97,,
444,0.97,4657.185,4662.19,Thank you so much.,98,,
445,0.97,4662.19,4667.996,Councilmember Gonzalez and Councilmember Lewis.,98,,
446,0.97,4667.996,4691.887,"My question Dovetails Dovetails nicely from director noble's response so I was--as we look at this slide, we see a few things that fairly characterized as being in the area of violence prevention or violence interruption.",99,,
447,0.97,4691.887,4711.373,Was wonder figure the Mayor's office or any of the agencies had any conversations about whether it would be more appropriate to house some of the problematic areas in a different agency and a stand alone agency.,99,,
448,0.97,4711.373,4729.391,"For example, in conjunction with some of the programming that is also designed to engage in violence prevention that currently lives in the office of domestic violence and sexual assault.",99,,
449,0.97,4729.391,4729.558,,100,,
450,0.97,4729.558,4736.965,I don't think we have had conversations about a stand alone unit for these items.,101,,
451,0.97,4736.965,4749.945,"And the division and I will let director Tonya Kim weigh in on that, the new division of Hsd and to hold a lot of these together there.",101,,
452,0.97,4749.945,4759.354,I think that is what you meant Councilmember if I'm not understanding your questions directly and director Kim anything to add.,101,,
453,0.97,4759.354,4775.27,If we think about the systems we are working with and the providers and victims and survivors it really fits nicely with our mission at the human services Department as well as the other collection of safety investments that we have.,102,,
454,0.97,4775.27,4797.259,Often times these are the same individuals or families cross cutting multiple as much as areas and by having them together we are being efficient and supporting our providers and the community members as a whole.,102,,
455,0.97,4797.259,4820.248,"So I think that under REX's leadership and the team frankly because this is not a one person initiative, that's the in tent of the work that we are doing and going back to the Dvip.",102,,
456,0.97,4820.248,4827.989,"The gender base violence Teamworks Collaboratively with multiple folks and the courts as well as prosecuting attorneys, et cetera.",102,,
457,0.97,4827.989,4845.34,So we are starting to stream line the relationships and move these together.,102,,
458,0.97,4845.34,4853.648,The city attorney's office is currently housing this pretrial diversion.,103,,
459,0.97,4853.648,4857.652,For young adults and the Firearm surrender program.,103,,
460,0.97,4857.652,4863.258,And some of the regional domestic violence funding.,103,,
461,0.97,4863.258,4911.573,And some of the questions that I'm raising is rather given the stream lining of the work that you just reference director Kim if it would be a worthwhile exercise to explore whether we can create more more efficiency by Rehousing some of these and sort of Rebrand it or call it something else and more reflective of the body of work that is around violence prevention.,103,,
462,0.97,4911.573,4919.681,It is always prosecute to see where we can stream line it and be cost effective.,104,,
463,0.97,4919.681,4938.533,I think it is a good idea to look and I am super mission focused and happy to take on bodies of work that is really about the human services and social services and that network of safety where it makes safe and open to having that conversation.,104,,
464,0.97,4938.533,4949.477,So I am clear there is not curb conversations being had in that particular vain.,105,,
465,0.97,4949.477,4950.812,"Not at that 30,000 level.",106,,
466,0.97,4950.812,4983.678,I want to go to central staff to an area that I'm interested in identifying a mechanism on which that analysis can be supported and facilitated so we can have a clear sense of how we can continue to short the program in a way that will be institutionalized and have good synergy with the human services component that are part work.,107,,
467,0.97,4983.678,4984.179,Thank you.,107,,
468,0.97,4984.179,4985.213,Madam chair.,107,,
469,0.97,4985.213,4985.68,Thank you.,108,,
470,0.97,4985.68,4986.514,Councilmember Lewis.,108,,
471,0.97,4986.514,4988.55,I see your up next.,108,,
472,0.97,4988.55,4994.055,"Thank you, Madam chair.",109,,
473,0.97,4994.055,5016.344,This is just briefly in response to what director noble said about expanding the scope of Prefiled diversion in accordance with the report that we got in the public safety Committee a few weeks ago and the potential uncertainty about leadership change in the city attorney's office.,109,,
474,0.97,5016.344,5027.188,I do believe that per the chart the Council can describe additional duties to the city attorney's office.,109,,
475,0.97,5027.188,5042.17,We could have companion legislation to make the Prefiling diversion just a permanent thing we do other than an additive program that city attorney Holmes has pursued in their time in the office.,109,,
476,0.97,5042.17,5056.618,And was just raise that if the budgeting process is being impacted by potential uncertainty about turnover.,109,,
477,0.97,5056.618,5058.987,There may be a way for the Council to Institutallize it.,109,,
478,0.97,5058.987,5076.805,"A lot of the work in the city attorney's office will be based in some kind of refiling system rather than the historic way, misdemeanor prosecutions have been done.",109,,
479,0.97,5076.805,5082.31,Wanted to flag that if that might have influence on how we go forward.,109,,
480,0.97,5082.31,5088.082,Thank you Councilmember Lewis for bringing your knowledge from that Department as well Withyou.,110,,
481,0.97,5088.082,5092.32,I made a note of it and we will follow up on that I'm sure.,110,,
482,0.97,5092.32,5093.588,Thanks for that flag.,110,,
483,0.97,5093.588,5104.132,I to have one question and I see two hands up so I want to make sure I don't cut off any Councilmembers.,110,,
484,0.97,5104.132,5108.336,I will ask about the electronic home monitoring.,110,,
485,0.97,5108.336,5145.373,"On the electronic monitoring the last bullet on the Left- hand side, can you walk us through what will be the electrical funding with the electric home options in Seattle municipal court or is this for securing more units.",110,,
486,0.97,5145.373,5152.814,We will be able to subsidize more people to make it an option for folks that could not otherwise afford it.,111,,
487,0.97,5152.814,5174.502,I don't believe but we will have to speak to Seattle municipal court that it involves purring any additional equipment and expanding the money available to subsidize to allow people to take advantage of that in lieu of secured detention.,111,,
488,0.97,5174.502,5190.151,This is a request of the court the way Julie has described.,112,,
489,0.97,5190.151,5203.031,I obviously defer to the folks working in the field for a long time that are on Council here and part of a public safety Commission.,113,,
490,0.97,5203.031,5212.207,I would look forward to hearing more about if it is expanding the number of people with access or expanding the subsides for the existing folks.,113,,
491,0.97,5212.207,5213.541,Thanks for getting back to us.,113,,
492,0.97,5213.541,5218.88,Council President did you have additional questions.,113,,
493,0.97,5218.88,5219.28,Just go ahead.,113,,
494,0.97,5219.28,5244.305,"This is--I think the my Miss Tal court, I am sure they are listening and Cueing up an Email with the Statistics that they have available but this came to light in 2017.",114,,
495,0.97,5244.305,5247.542,I can't remember ca it is called.,114,,
496,0.97,5247.542,5306.034,"The joint criminal justice something or the other and sort of one of the points of information that was available that came out of that was my my understanding and appreciation that we have this electronic home monitoring program that does in fact allow people to avoid active Incarceration and I also learned in that process there was a huge amount of inequity who could access the home monitoring program that comes at a cost and for those that have means obviously they are able to buy into this option and see inside of the jail but for poor folks especially those experiencing homelessness, this was not available to them unless the court had the funds necessary to lets them live free.",114,,
497,0.97,5306.034,5323.918,So what we were seeing is folks otherwise eligible to be released on their own Recog entrance but needed to be monitored because of applicable state statutes and they were incarcerated because after lack of means.,114,,
498,0.97,5323.918,5336.798,Ultimately the system change and it is to very our legislatures advocate for reform in this area to be so punitive and not require surveillance.,114,,
499,0.97,5336.798,5355.35,I think it is important for us to make sure that we allow again in the interim allow for those you do not have the resources and be released from jail on this monitoring program.,114,,
500,0.97,5355.35,5355.917,And the ability to do so.,114,,
501,0.97,5355.917,5384.145,Funding this program while we wait for the state reforms to occur is the poorest of the poor to interact with municipal court to be detained in jail until their case is Adjudicated and we have a huge backlog of these cases.,114,,
502,0.97,5384.145,5405.299,I wanted to give history around how this came about and I'm sure that court is willing to provide us with more additional information about who is Accessing the subsidized program and what outcomes they are seeing as a result.,114,,
503,0.97,5405.299,5424.952,I in general do not like surveillance programs but the issues that there are state laws for particular charges if people are released.,114,,
504,0.97,5424.952,5432.527,That is the long game in terms of Legislature in this area.,114,,
505,0.97,5432.527,5432.794,I think.,114,,
506,0.97,5432.794,5444.071,Appreciate that and thank you for the background and the follow-up and there are a number of folks to subsidize it further that is an important goal.,115,,
507,0.97,5444.071,5447.008,Councilmember do you have any other questions?,115,,
508,0.97,5447.008,5451.546,Colleagues I am not seeing any additional hands.,115,,
509,0.97,5451.546,5451.813,Wait.,116,,
510,0.97,5451.813,5452.146,I did.,116,,
511,0.97,5452.146,5452.647,I am so sorry.,116,,
512,0.97,5452.647,5453.114,No problem.,117,,
513,0.97,5453.114,5455.283,And I know we are one minute over.,118,,
514,0.97,5455.283,5461.856,I will make this as fast as I can when I pulled up my notes.,118,,
515,0.97,5461.856,5467.628,I had questions about the Csos.,118,,
516,0.97,5467.628,5469.831,Should I hold for SPD or ask now.,118,,
517,0.97,5469.831,5471.232,I would ask that you hold that.,119,,
518,0.97,5471.232,5472.033,Then I am done.,120,,
519,0.97,5472.033,5477.738,We will hold that last box under SP D for SPD to come in.,121,,
520,0.97,5477.738,5498.559,I want to thank the folks part of this broad panel and thanks to Councilmembers Herbold and Morales for your comments as well and I know that much of the six or seven bullets is something that Council is tracking.,121,,
521,0.97,5498.559,5502.497,We will move to the last item.,121,,
522,0.97,5502.497,5508.236,We haven't Hour-And-A-Half for this.,121,,
523,0.97,5508.236,5513.14,I would ask Madam clerk to read this.,121,,
524,0.97,5513.14,5516.344,Seattle police Department for briefing and discussion.,121,,
525,0.97,5516.344,5518.045,Okay.,122,,
526,0.97,5518.045,5519.847,Wonderful.,122,,
527,0.97,5519.847,5532.56,So we do have with us Chris Fisher and we have Angela Socho and director noble.,122,,
528,0.97,5532.56,5564.258,We haven't Hour-And-A-Half for this presentation and want to make sure that everybody gets their comments and questions in Gan after the presentation we will hear from Councilmember Herbold for any questions and Councilmember Gonzalez has the first question about Csos and let's go ahead and kick it off.,122,,
529,0.97,5564.258,5564.859,Welcome chief Diaz.,122,,
530,0.97,5564.859,5569.263,Good afternoon and thank you chairwoman Mosqueda and other couple members.,123,,
531,0.97,5569.263,5574.368,Thank you for giving me the opportunity for my vision of the Seattle police Department for 2022.,123,,
532,0.97,5574.368,5593.12,When I spoke to you last year during the budget process about my plans for the Department I highlighted my principles and sister I-Centering our work on humanity and community engagement and more Rale and stewardship and Cocreated a new model.,123,,
533,0.97,5593.12,5606.467,"In the face of historic loss of officers, 300 in the last 21 month and the ongoing pandemic I will report that we made significant process in each of these areas along with knowing that we have a lot more to do.",123,,
534,0.97,5606.467,5612.773,And in a tumultuous year we began operating in the budget and we were able to address future needs.,123,,
535,0.97,5612.773,5624.452,We restarted our hiring and while we did not reach our ambitious 2021 goal we made progress and continued to hit record levels of diversity.,123,,
536,0.97,5624.452,5629.657,Close to 40% minority hires and to percent female.,123,,
537,0.97,5629.657,5641.736,We are prime for exceptional hiring in 2022 and extended access for those that remain with us and continue to do all we can to make it a better place to work.,123,,
538,0.97,5641.736,5648.042,We building trust and conversations and opening honest dialogue and ready for the lunch of a new model with the community we serve.,123,,
539,0.97,5648.042,5660.955,There is real work still to be done and I need to begin with discussion for members of the Department and for hard work and service to this community.,123,,
540,0.97,5660.955,5661.756,Officers and staff are incredible.,123,,
541,0.97,5661.756,5670.698,Throughout the pandemic most are on the front lines risking their lives and health of their loved ones like so many other first responders.,123,,
542,0.97,5670.698,5680.074,We have asked them to Japped take change and they have responded successfully and I can't thank them enough for their commitment.,123,,
543,0.97,5680.074,5691.018,In a few minutes there will be proposed action for 2022 and this Proceedsal highlights how we plan to move the did Department forward in 2022 and not losing site of the lessons learned.,123,,
544,0.97,5691.018,5700.628,Before we get to specific es I want to provide you with a general overview for my vision of the Seattle police Department in 2022 and the future.,123,,
545,0.97,5700.628,5703.297,Shouldn't be surprising as we focus on three areas.,123,,
546,0.97,5703.297,5711.205,Responding to and preventing violent crime and the loss of life.,123,,
547,0.97,5711.205,5727.021,Working to retain exceptional officers and continue to aggressively hire as many qualified officers and implement a new approach for community engagement and policing and grounded in real relationships and officers are doing work and responding to and preventing violence right now.,123,,
548,0.97,5727.021,5742.703,We are on pace to take over one thousand guns off of the street and recovered 2500 Shell casings and connecting these events to understand who is driving the violence and who's at risk and where the crime guns are coming from.,123,,
549,0.97,5742.703,5753.147,Saving lives and expanded the Emt program and officers arriving on violence and injury and applying Tourniquets and performing Cpr.,123,,
550,0.97,5753.147,5776.203,On the front lines of Overdose crisis and this year we have more individuals that died of Overdoses of Fentanyl than in all of 2020 and officers are on the scene Administrating the drugs.,123,,
551,0.97,5776.203,5787.648,We have over 100 pounds of Meth recovered and 700 pounds of heroin and cocaine.,123,,
552,0.97,5787.648,5793.387,We have a priority that we are working to keep amazing officers and bring on more qualified recruits.,123,,
553,0.97,5793.387,5805.366,It takes a significant number of officers to safely respond to shootings and to hold those that directly discharge dozens of rounds in our neighborhoods and disrupt the networks for the Addictions.,123,,
554,0.97,5805.366,5817.211,The creation of the triage team and expansion of the as much as officer proposals will provide assistance and allow freeing up officers to respond to emergency calls.,123,,
555,0.97,5817.211,5827.555,Though in practice this is happening already given our staffing constraints and the proposals will fill capacity rather than increase capacity.,123,,
556,0.97,5827.555,5838.365,We have or implementing as many retention strategies and will continue to need new ideas and support to have sufficient number of personnel to do this work.,123,,
557,0.97,5838.365,5847.741,Those are my operational priorities saving likes and answering calls and having enough personnel to do the work and do it safely and a moment for the long term wellness.,123,,
558,0.97,5847.741,5853.314,Functionally my focus as a new foundation for how we approach public safety.,123,,
559,0.97,5853.314,5857.284,This approach is centered on round three primary ten and Thes.,123,,
560,0.97,5857.284,5859.92,Relational Policen and officer wellness and growth mind set.,123,,
561,0.97,5859.92,5868.329,I believe this is a map for more comprehensive known as relational policing.,123,,
562,0.97,5868.329,5875.603,"It means officers and, detectives and command staff are committed to establishing real and meaningful connections with the community we serve.",123,,
563,0.97,5875.603,5882.142,And in practice this means SPD will share more with the community and take the lead.,123,,
564,0.97,5882.142,5886.48,This budget support efforts to Reorient how we approach engagement.,123,,
565,0.97,5886.48,5897.891,We will launch a Prealaska training for recruits and connecting them to community and providing a foundation of care and principles of De- escalation.,123,,
566,0.97,5897.891,5899.994,No other Department is looking into this training.,123,,
567,0.97,5899.994,5912.039,We will provide every member of the Department with outward training and setting us up to embrace learning and commitment to bettering the agency and the community.,123,,
568,0.97,5912.039,5915.676,We will continue to grow and our service engagement.,123,,
569,0.97,5915.676,5923.05,"Finally the Department is continuing to work productive with our accountability partners, the Department of justice and the Federal monitor.",123,,
570,0.97,5923.05,5932.026,This proposal to continue this work and to allow SP D to maintain the commitment to ongoing accountability and transparency.,123,,
571,0.97,5932.026,5942.002,"Just as we require employees to take annual training, we must invest in these efforts to ensure they are on pace with best practices.",123,,
572,0.97,5942.002,5950.277,In the midst of Chals I remain optimistic and the members of SPD have shown they can accomplish whatever Meg we give them if we have the tools necessary.,123,,
573,0.97,5950.277,5960.888,This budget continues the hard work we have done in 2021 and allows us to start a new project and expand existing efforts for 2022.,123,,
574,0.97,5960.888,5972.032,I will turn this over to executive director Angie Soshi to walk us through this.,123,,
575,0.97,5972.032,5974.134,Thank you.,123,,
576,0.97,5974.134,5975.703,"Thank you, chief.",124,,
577,0.97,5975.703,5981.675,If I could have the operator of the slide deck go forward.,124,,
578,0.97,5981.675,5985.379,Should I pause to give--I don't know if there is any questions.,124,,
579,0.97,5985.379,5993.053,I will go through the slide and come back to questions.,125,,
580,0.97,5993.053,5994.922,Perfect.,126,,
581,0.97,5994.922,5996.256,Thank you very much.,126,,
582,0.97,5996.256,6010.704,To the 2022 proposed changes include requests and operating change requests and as noted in the prior presentation the proposed budget is about 2-And- A-Half million dollars more than the 2021 adopted budget.,127,,
583,0.97,6010.704,6019.88,To summarize at a high level we finalize the transfer of the parking enforcement operation and the call center.,127,,
584,0.97,6019.88,6030.924,We have made corrections and allocated costs specifically the allocated costs for I.T.,127,,
585,0.97,6030.924,6058.685,There was a reduction in 2020 and we have had standard cost changes and this reduces by 3.7 million the amount needed to finance the community safety investment that you got a preview and video analysts in the office of police accountability and the citywide language premium.,127,,
586,0.97,6058.685,6087.848,"Additionally two million was transferred from SPD and two SPD from Finance general Reserve and paid parental lead back fill as many of you may recall, historically we requested the funding for the mental process and that total expense has remained consistent in recent years and we feel confident in the budget and appropriating the supplemental as we have previously.",127,,
587,0.97,6087.848,6106.2,Finally we reversed one time reductions tied to Covid-19 such as overtime and training that was limited by travel restrictions and translations and also portions of the executive five percent cut in the baseline process.,127,,
588,0.97,6106.2,6108.535,And Inline with that.,127,,
589,0.97,6108.535,6146.773,And we opted not to request new funding for some things and Uncovering them and many of the changes are neutral and we will discuss where there are policy implications and we will try and go to greater detail there but again the change requests are primarily technical in nature but want to give everyone an opportunity to ask questions as needed.,127,,
590,0.97,6146.773,6151.979,As a reminder we will take questions at the end.,128,,
591,0.97,6151.979,6153.213,I do see Councilmember Lewis' hand.,129,,
592,0.97,6153.213,6157.284,Did you have a clarification or can you hold your questions for the Cue?,129,,
593,0.97,6157.284,6161.321,Just quick and I think it would be appropriate Madam chair.,130,,
594,0.97,6161.321,6175.302,You decide fit is too long and cut me off or punt it.,130,,
595,0.97,6175.302,6176.503,But Cracken games.,130,,
596,0.97,6176.503,6192.986,My understanding that is we get games compensated from the sports teams and I wanted to check in and see what the case is on that given that you just said you weren't requesting money for cracking games.,130,,
597,0.97,6192.986,6193.287,Yes.,131,,
598,0.97,6193.287,6198.025,For the sporting events those are governed by contracts.,131,,
599,0.97,6198.025,6206.099,The reimbursement contracts and the majority are reimburse to the city's general fund.,131,,
600,0.97,6206.099,6234.461,They are in the second step that typically happens that it corresponds with expenditures because we have restored event overtime and there's uncertainty around the amount of overtime that is needed for events in 2022 we have opted to not request specific appropriation for the cracking games and I wanted to flag that as it is relevant for the overtime discussion specifically.,131,,
601,0.97,6234.461,6235.662,To clarify that point.,132,,
602,0.97,6235.662,6244.905,"Just because SPD gets paid doesn't mean their budget increases, the budget authority, the amount of money they can spend regardless of where the money comes from.",132,,
603,0.97,6244.905,6252.679,A contract with outside agency requires increase budget authority in order to spend the proceeds if you will.,132,,
604,0.97,6252.679,6260.087,So that is the further explanation of Angela's point.,132,,
605,0.97,6260.087,6262.122,Just in case that helps.,132,,
606,0.97,6262.122,6262.956,"Thanks, Ben.",133,,
607,0.97,6262.956,6297.324,"And we also have--that is our traffic safety fund that is a separate fund in s DOT and operating fund that we charged to that and the revenue comes from the automatic traffic safety program and our officers that review those tickets and sign off on those, they charge their time to that particular Fund and it is not a general fund.",134,,
608,0.97,6297.324,6325.218,Appropriation for us and Lastly the full time equipment change line as I needed earlier we did finalize the transfer of the enforcement in the call center in the 2022 budget and so what you are seeing there is a reduction tied to the transfer of the personnel in those two sections.,134,,
609,0.97,6325.218,6329.156,We can jump to the next slide.,135,,
610,0.97,6329.156,6348.575,"The item one here, th community safety investment $3.7 million reduction to SPD's budget to finance the new triage team and the regional peace keepers collective.",135,,
611,0.97,6348.575,6366.159,Item 2 on that 5th item is a budget neutral item and transfer of available funding from the salary line to the continuing investment in technology item in the Department.,135,,
612,0.97,6366.159,6375.602,And we have discussed in the 2021 mid year process and further details available.,135,,
613,0.97,6375.602,6394.054,Covers a number of items that we have discussed previously and happy to answer questions or to go into greater detail or to go into discovery as requested.,135,,
614,0.97,6394.054,6400.26,Going to the next slide we have an ad of $1.3 million.,135,,
615,0.97,6400.26,6416.743,"Not truly an ad, a transfer of Department budget from salary to the expansion of the community service program in 2022.",135,,
616,0.97,6416.743,6466.827,I will note that this does require ongoing investment because we are only accounting for the 2022 budget need and this will need to be Revisited in the 2023Bienum and Lastly we have the program that is a transfer of Department budget for officer positions that will not be able to fill in 2022 we would like to support the incentives.,135,,
617,0.97,6466.827,6467.16,For Hirings.,135,,
618,0.97,6467.16,6472.833,There was some confusion around language in the budget book.,135,,
619,0.97,6472.833,6473.366,We apologize.,135,,
620,0.97,6473.366,6487.914,But this is strictly hiring program and does not include retention bonuses of any kind.,135,,
621,0.97,6487.914,6489.516,Next slide.,135,,
622,0.97,6489.516,6515.909,"Here we have $157,000 being added to the Department's budget to Fubbed a full time Video content Creator and covered in the last session on a request of OPA submitted on behalf of the Department.",135,,
623,0.97,6515.909,6518.144,"Next slide, please.",135,,
624,0.97,6518.144,6518.845,The racial equity efforts.,135,,
625,0.97,6518.845,6526.853,The chief went into details on the stuff we are doing at a high level.,135,,
626,0.97,6526.853,6536.529,Because we have not made--I have since earlier been an active participant on the Department's change team.,135,,
627,0.97,6536.529,6550.877,We really are looking for ways to collaborate with our change team through the budget process.,135,,
628,0.97,6550.877,6556.316,And I was encouraged to navigate that differently than in previous years.,135,,
629,0.97,6556.316,6591.351,There has been a lot of confidentiality around the budget and open invitation to engage the change team in the different way this year as a result I started to go to the monthly meetings and we didn't have the bull our budget was technical in nature and I did not bore the change team members with those but I do look forward to continual collaboration with them on budget items.,135,,
630,0.97,6591.351,6601.127,I think it is really important to give that perspective as we are navigating various policy decisions.,135,,
631,0.97,6601.127,6601.494,Specifically.,135,,
632,0.97,6601.494,6608.635,And these bullets take on the things we are doing for racial equity.,135,,
633,0.97,6608.635,6618.478,They are not tied to any new budget proposals.,135,,
634,0.97,6618.478,6621.982,Real quick I think I forgot to mention this.,136,,
635,0.97,6621.982,6634.494,"This interaction with the financial operations of the Department and changing to something that we specifically encourage this year, and the Department does that in varying degrees.",136,,
636,0.97,6634.494,6648.341,Not to diminish the work but to know that was a general effort recognizing that it is important that we build the budget with this in mind and not just review them after the fact if you will.,136,,
637,0.97,6648.341,6660.053,Again credit SPD and to let you know that was done on an executive side.,136,,
638,0.97,6660.053,6661.855,Great.,137,,
639,0.97,6661.855,6663.289,Julie.,137,,
640,0.97,6663.289,6663.657,Anything else?,137,,
641,0.97,6663.657,6676.403,That wraps up my overview happy to go to the Q and a unless Chris Fisher has something he wants to add before we go to the questions and answers.,138,,
642,0.97,6676.403,6683.476,I am not seeing Dr. Fisher pop up so we will make sure to note it as necessary.,139,,
643,0.97,6683.476,6693.186,We will do Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember president and if there is any additional hands please raise those.,139,,
644,0.97,6693.186,6697.19,Thank you very much.,140,,
645,0.97,6697.19,6700.093,I want to start with opening remarks.,140,,
646,0.97,6700.093,6701.995,Thanking SP D staff for the presentation today.,140,,
647,0.97,6701.995,6737.363,I want to note that we have been very focused over the last Year-And-A-Half on addresses use of force incidents associated with policing protests and we have been focused on incorporating alternatives to policing as we discussed during the community safety and community led investments presentation . I really appreciate the openness of chief Diaz and the recognition that sworn officers may not be always the best response in some situations.,140,,
648,0.97,6737.363,6751.945,It is a challenging Year-And-A- half and I don't want to lose sight that officers like other workers hose job it is to work with the establish have experienced stress and trauma associated with serving the public during Covid.,140,,
649,0.97,6751.945,6767.26,I Appreciae the service of officers that have stuck with Seattle despite the challenges and I recognize the shortage of officers is significantly reduce 911 priority responses.,140,,
650,0.97,6767.26,6772.765,These are responses that have a standard goal of seven minutes.,140,,
651,0.97,6772.765,6796.289,It is important that we make investments to address the real workload challenges for sworn officers and I believe we can do so by quickly and carefully police responses.,140,,
652,0.97,6796.289,6807.934,We have seen a staggering increase in domestic violence violence.,140,,
653,0.97,6807.934,6809.002,"Suicide, gun violence.",140,,
654,0.97,6809.002,6817.277,I have heard the chief says social interact is perishable skill and this is true.,140,,
655,0.97,6817.277,6852.545,I want to note that--I want to lift up the fact that the Department has proposal to support this through shifting of $3.5 million of SPD's budget to support the rolling alternatives and really appreciate that they are proposing to do so for the 2022 budget.,140,,
656,0.97,6852.545,6858.985,I do have a couple of things on preliminary analysis of the 2022 budget.,140,,
657,0.97,6858.985,6905.298,"You know the presentation we just saw, it looks like--and as I understand that presentation it is designed to highlight the major changes in this budget over the previous year's budget and to show cuts and ads and it looks like most of the things that were added were from salary Savings and the exception was the OPA request not clear to me where the additional funds are being allocated in the SPD budget.",140,,
658,0.97,6905.298,6915.541,The things we went over it is not added money but reallocated from salary savings.,140,,
659,0.97,6915.541,6923.216,If you look at the budget as you mentioned about a million increase.,140,,
660,0.97,6923.216,6927.654,That's one issue.,140,,
661,0.97,6927.654,6962.655,It appears that the Mayor's restored budget stores and this is where we can find the ads and stores the cuts made in the 2021 budget and the overtime budget from restores 2.6 million overtime to the level of 29.,140,,
662,0.97,6962.655,7000.56,"6 million and restores 4.1 million to civilian funding and restores 175,000 travel and entertaining that the Council had cut and restores $300,000 of discretionary purchases.",140,,
663,0.97,7000.56,7009.035,There was restoration of three million of that and the Council provided most of that although not all.,140,,
664,0.97,7009.035,7010.002,It is just background.,140,,
665,0.97,7010.002,7035.128,"My specific questions are what were the decisions to restore the travel and training and the discretionary purchase and the overtime budget, were they based on analysis and specific estimates?",140,,
666,0.97,7035.128,7037.063,Was there event overtime.,140,,
667,0.97,7037.063,7063.723,Was there a look at the training budget that was missed in 2021 that required restoration of the full budget.,140,,
668,0.97,7065.558,7073.433,Want to understand those particular cuts.,140,,
669,0.97,7073.433,7080.173,I will go down the line.,140,,
670,0.97,7080.173,7131.057,We restored the reduction for the overtime with the idea we would need the funding as the city reopens and the number of events for the work increases been we know the Seahawks have returns and the concerts and things are starting to be added to the schedule and we expect a recover.,140,,
671,0.97,7131.057,7133.96,In 2019 we worked over 600 events on overtime.,140,,
672,0.97,7133.96,7147.773,"And I don't know, we don't know if requesting additional.",140,,
673,0.97,7148.341,7156.883,22 of the Kraken will be worked in 2022.,140,,
674,0.97,7156.883,7189.782,"They are scheduled . I would say from an estimate standpoint, we expect full recovery at some point and it seemed reasonable to request the restoration of the existing overtime budget but does not account for the parking enforcement overtime that was transferred specifically for special events to Sdot.",140,,
675,0.97,7189.782,7209.835,"When you add that 6.4 million to the 2021 proposed budget, it only gets you Partway to the 29 million . The remaining 2 million is attributable to the paid parental leave transfer from Finance general.",140,,
676,0.97,7209.835,7225.618,"In talking, we decided it was appropriate to depart from that past practice, the supplement of appropriating the supplemental process.",140,,
677,0.97,7225.618,7228.754,Originally the idea is we want to know the actual expenditures until late in the year.,140,,
678,0.97,7228.754,7235.461,We have seen very consistent expenditures from 1.8 to $2 million each year for paid parental leave Backfill.,140,,
679,0.97,7235.461,7257.583,"That is the origin of that $2 million . In retrospect, I should have included that in a Powerpoint presentation that we just went through because I think it is reflective of new money that is not new general fund money, but money that is being appropriated to SPD in a different fashion than it has previously.",140,,
680,0.97,7257.583,7265.091,I would say the 2 million is truly an add to our base budget.,140,,
681,0.97,7265.091,7272.598,"Additionally we had language premium Stipend of about $19,000.",140,,
682,0.97,7272.598,7285.244,There were also baseline adjustments that were a true add to the budget for the agile wage increases restored citywide for select employees.,140,,
683,0.97,7285.244,7287.88,Those were put on hold in 2020.,140,,
684,0.97,7287.88,7312.038,There are a lot of net changes in the budget . The restoration of the salary and benefit cost budget for police officers is also included and does account for the source of funding for some of the items that we did highlight.,140,,
685,0.97,7312.038,7320.913,"Normally when we are Repurposing funding within the budget, we are trying to think of the best way to represent that in this presentation.",140,,
686,0.97,7320.913,7328.854,It did make it confusing though in accounting for new ads and Repurposing money.,140,,
687,0.97,7328.854,7341.333,"I know Councilmember Herbold, your attention to the BSL and transfer of money between BSL's, we wanted to make sure we accounted for that as well.",140,,
688,0.97,7341.333,7369.061,"Past practice you would often work that out throughout the year and not necessarily present those transfers or build those into the budget . We took a different approach this year and wanted to make sure we were capturing the budget for items like the technology investments and moving that money around in the budget process as opposed to Revisiting that midyear, like we did in 2021.",140,,
689,0.97,7369.061,7378.07,It does make it a little more complicated though to unpack everything that is in the budget.,140,,
690,0.97,7378.07,7395.921,"As far as the travel training and equipment supply budgets that were restored, we do know that travel and training has been limited due to Covid.",140,,
691,0.97,7395.921,7414.039,"The reference to that in the change request, we did not do an analysis to determine specifically how that additional funding would be spent in our statement of legislative intent response.",140,,
692,0.97,7414.039,7419.779,"We try to explain how the money is allocated and used, but it can be unpredictable.",140,,
693,0.97,7419.779,7434.96,We don't always know the Certifications are often tied to Recertification's and the need to new Certifications and personnel movement in the Department.,140,,
694,0.97,7434.96,7445.671,"I would say for the travel and training, we did not do a training by training analysis but we know we have seen limited travel this year due to Covid.",140,,
695,0.97,7445.671,7469.628,"For the equipment supply budget, that was restored . We have deferred costs tied to, you know, holding off on furniture replacement, facility changes and things that needed to be done over the last couple of years.",140,,
696,0.97,7469.628,7484.543,"We have tried to be mindful of expenditures given the revenue crisis and uncertainty of this year's budget . There are deferred expenses . We also have some items, the less lethal tools.",140,,
697,0.97,7484.543,7489.615,"For example, there are things we are contemplating purchasing if the budget allows for it.",140,,
698,0.97,7489.615,7495.287,"I can't tell you exactly how that $300,000 is planned for 2022 at this point.",140,,
699,0.97,7495.287,7505.631,"If I could add some comments . When those reductions were taken, we didn't think they were necessarily going to be ongoing, right?",141,,
700,0.97,7505.631,7521.046,"My instructions were as Covid hit, let's hold all of the cash we possibly can . It would likely be deferred to additional resources in the future.",141,,
701,0.97,7521.046,7538.13,"Just another point about the overall increase in the budget, it is important to recognize there are central cost charges, like the hr functions, the vehicle charges that are passed through the Department that are also driving increases.",141,,
702,0.97,7538.13,7549.742,We use that structures of the departments can face those costs directly and they can spread those costs a cost across our grant dollars in the city doesn't bear all of it.,141,,
703,0.97,7549.742,7564.757,Grants are described as overhead costs . that is another factor outside of the Department's control . It is true of every Department.,141,,
704,0.97,7564.757,7565.391,Thank you.,142,,
705,0.97,7565.391,7580.406,I will turn it over to Council President Gonzalez . We will come back to Councilmember Herbold at the end here.,142,,
706,0.97,7580.406,7582.074,"Thank you, Madam chair.",143,,
707,0.97,7582.074,7606.532,"Just really quickly, I had some questions about the CSO's . can you just let me know how many of the current 18 full-time equivalents are currently filled?",143,,
708,0.97,7606.532,7620.546,"The last I checked, we had eight CSO vacancies, all of which are in an active hiring process.",144,,
709,0.97,7620.546,7621.747,10?,144,,
710,0.97,7621.747,7625.05,11 of the 18 are currently filled.,144,,
711,0.97,7625.05,7626.652,Okay.,145,,
712,0.97,7626.652,7635.227,And windows SPD anticipate the remaining seven will be filled?,145,,
713,0.97,7635.227,7635.627,By when?,145,,
714,0.97,7635.627,7647.973,"They have held interviews and I believe we have a number of candidates in the background process that can take anywhere from two to four months, depending on the process.",146,,
715,0.97,7647.973,7658.984,"That is my understanding from hr, that all of the positions have candidates identified . We are just awaiting the result of the background.",146,,
716,0.97,7658.984,7659.385,Okay.,147,,
717,0.97,7659.385,7671.93,"And can you give me a general sense of, you know, sort of from recruitment, you know, hiring to sort of, you know, you are in place and you are operational?",147,,
718,0.97,7671.93,7676.001,What is sort of the average length of time?,147,,
719,0.97,7676.001,7678.804,For CSO?,148,,
720,0.97,7678.804,7683.308,Yes.,149,,
721,0.97,7683.308,7688.814,I am going to see if Chris has an answer to that.,150,,
722,0.97,7688.814,7692.317,"If you don't, if you could just take note of it and let us know.",151,,
723,0.97,7692.317,7693.185,That's fine.,151,,
724,0.97,7693.185,7696.088,"Yeah, absolutely.",152,,
725,0.97,7696.088,7698.991,Unless Dr. Fisher has the answer?,153,,
726,0.97,7698.991,7703.028,Best to confirm that.,154,,
727,0.97,7703.028,7705.33,"I could guess, but it's best to confirm.",154,,
728,0.97,7705.33,7709.835,I would welcome the opportunity to learn those details.,155,,
729,0.97,7709.835,7735.16,And then can you just remind us sort of what functions are SPD primarily utilizing the Csos at the moment? are there models on how you're using the CSO's?,155,,
730,0.97,7735.16,7757.449,"I don't have any deviations from the original plan . It is a mix of community outreach and engagement, follow-up via patrol contact for initiation and I know that they have assisted special projects . No major deviation from the original plan.",156,,
731,0.97,7757.449,7767.659,I know there was a special emphasis on youth services and youth engagement.,156,,
732,0.97,7767.659,7793.285,"Is there any way to determine or is SPD at all tracking how Csos are helping to reduce--well, I guess freeing up more officer time so our sworn officers can focus on higher priority calls?",157,,
733,0.97,7793.285,7804.83,Is that information you all are tracking in any manner or have had observations about?,157,,
734,0.97,7804.83,7812.738,I will cut to Chris on this one from a tracking standpoint.,158,,
735,0.97,7812.738,7817.042,If we are documenting that anywhere.,158,,
736,0.97,7817.042,7827.352,I think 50% of their time is going toward resource engagement were there helping on patrol or on other projects.,159,,
737,0.97,7827.352,7839.765,I don't know how often they are handing off a call so the officer can leave the scene . It is a good thing to check . We will work with the data team to see if we can pull that out and get a sense of that.,159,,
738,0.97,7839.765,7846.872,I know that was somewhat limited during Covid.,159,,
739,0.97,7846.872,7869.394,"Just because of where we were trying to use them and not expose them unnecessarily to extra person to person contact, but as things have reopened, I think that is a good place to look in the data to see how well we can track that and if we are not able to tease that out . they do this over radio.",159,,
740,0.97,7869.394,7873.799,"We should be able to tease that out but it is a good thing for us to check on, Council President.",159,,
741,0.97,7873.799,7874.099,Great.,160,,
742,0.97,7874.099,7881.006,Grateful we might be able to identify that data point.,160,,
743,0.97,7881.006,7881.607,I really appreciate it.,160,,
744,0.97,7881.607,7892.584,And then this proposed budget includes an addition of six community service officers for a total of 24.,160,,
745,0.97,7892.584,7915.54,"I was just wondering where that number came from and whether or not the Department has additional capacity to, you know, increase the CSO unit at a more perhaps drastic pace.",160,,
746,0.97,7915.54,7924.449,"When we developed this proposal, it was in connection with the Reimagining community.",161,,
747,0.97,7924.449,7937.663,We took into consideration at the time that we had a number of vacancies in this area and wanted to make sure we were putting forth a realistic proposal in terms of how many we could actually Onboard.,161,,
748,0.97,7937.663,7946.171,"Other considerations are, you know, identifying facility and space for them, vehicles, making sure they have the equipment and we have the capacity to actually Onboard.",161,,
749,0.97,7946.171,7959.051,"I would say that the six was conservative . We would love to have more CSO's out there, but the six was meant to be a realistic addition.",161,,
750,0.97,7959.051,7971.997,We would start pursuing that Ideally in 2021 to make sure they were fully on boarded by 2022.,161,,
751,0.97,7971.997,7973.198,"Dr. Fisher, anything to add?",162,,
752,0.97,7973.198,7973.598,No.,163,,
753,0.97,7973.598,7976.501,Angela did a great job.,163,,
754,0.97,7976.501,7976.902,Okay.,164,,
755,0.97,7976.902,7979.504,That is helpful information.,164,,
756,0.97,7979.504,7992.718,"You know, the last question on Csos, even during our midyear supplemental budget we have had conversations about--and it really it is a policy question.",164,,
757,0.97,7992.718,7995.587,There have been questions on where the Csos should reside.,164,,
758,0.97,7995.587,8025.951,"I have heard through the grapevine, but not directly from you all about, you know, sort of your thinking about where the Csos are most appropriately housed . I did just want to ask the question on the record about, you know my understanding is that you all very much believe that the CSO function should remain within the Seattle police Department.",164,,
759,0.97,8025.951,8053.645,"The alternative is to, you know, continue to allow there to perhaps be a relationship between the Csos and SPD but have the function housed in a different Department, mostly the Department of community safety and communications . I just wanted to have an opportunity to hear directly from the Department about your perspective as it relates to that policy Questio.",164,,
760,0.97,8053.645,8061.386,Yeah . I am happy to take that.,165,,
761,0.97,8061.386,8065.991,I think there are plenty of Stakeholders that need to participate in this discussion.,165,,
762,0.97,8065.991,8077.602,"Just high level whether the Csos work at SPD or not, there is always going to be a body of work there.",165,,
763,0.97,8077.602,8096.688,"There is always going to be a police officer to encounter individuals who, you know, through the various contacts whether it is through 911, through an on view who need follow-up who need assistance, who need some kind of support that the police Department--immediate support, I should say.",165,,
764,0.97,8096.688,8115.207,"These officers aren't able to provide that due to staffing constraints, the need to go to another call . Csos are providing, you know, support, transportation . They are assisting at crime scenes.",165,,
765,0.97,8115.207,8129.221,"They have access to areas and information that wouldn't necessarily be available to them absent, you know, perhaps an MLA with another organization or agency.",165,,
766,0.97,8129.221,8134.126,"There is not only an efficiency to having them, but it is a relationship piece too.",165,,
767,0.97,8134.126,8141.366,Having a CSO is having a relationship with the police officers . I think there is a mutual benefit there.,165,,
768,0.97,8141.366,8149.941,There is a comfort in the relationship as we were establishing this program.,165,,
769,0.97,8149.941,8163.088,We felt he transfer the workload to another entity or another professional within the police Department.,165,,
770,0.97,8163.088,8168.793,That relationship has learning potential.,165,,
771,0.97,8168.793,8219.144,"We can see the Csos engaging with police officers . We are demonstrating different skill sets, sharing information that may not necessarily be available . The access to the listed logistical piece but the more Holistic piece or having these individuals work alongside the police, recognizing that they are providing a different service . They have a different set of training, different skill set that we think truly complements the work of the police officers.",165,,
772,0.97,8219.144,8234.359,"I would just add, I think, a lot of them didn't feel that they signed up to be this resource in a police Department.",166,,
773,0.97,8234.359,8281.773,"Targeting back to the 2019 innovation team hiring a retention analysis, one of the suggestions was a civilian Pathway to hiring and I think we have seen a couple of Csos from their experience maybe wanting to apply to be a sworn police officer . I think we have seen from the folks who have signed up to be Csos that a certain number of them have realized Maybe they want to serve in a different capacity but they may not have ever thought about that and they may not have the exposure . I know Angela did a tremendous amount of work, and so many others to stand up against the CSO program.",166,,
774,0.97,8281.773,8291.316,That project really short of showed the community when they were doing this outreach.,166,,
775,0.97,8291.316,8294.886,They wanted to be in the Seattle police Department and they wanted them to have that connection.,166,,
776,0.97,8294.886,8297.222,I think for a variety of reasons.,166,,
777,0.97,8297.222,8310.335,"We could take a look at what the notes said as to what the reasons were, but I remember one of the bullet points that came out from that engagement was that Angela and others had really helped lead about how to stand up to the CSO program.",166,,
778,0.97,8310.335,8318.143,"Yeah, and I am familiar with some of the community engagement work you all did.",167,,
779,0.97,8318.143,8321.68,That was during the time I was still chair of the safety committee.,167,,
780,0.97,8321.68,8328.253,I am aware of that . I just also know that that was then and this is now.,167,,
781,0.97,8328.253,8389.013,"You know, I guess what the real question is here, is SPD at a minimum open to continuing to have conversations about that policy question that I framed up? you know, I will just share that I am interested in sort of wrestling with that particular question to determine what the answer is and I would certainly be interested to continue to engage with the various Stakeholders in this area including the police Department around how we find a resolution to that Overarching policy question about where the Csos are most appropriately housed while still maintaining the integrity this is, which is to provide, you know, alternative and relief to sworn personnel at SPD.",167,,
782,0.97,8389.013,8405.964,"I think we are happy to engage in that discussion and just hope that--I know with some of the other transfers and functions outside of the police Department, we made the decision before we actually worked out some of the logistical details.",168,,
783,0.97,8405.964,8421.746,"In this case, I think just--you know, we are working hard to get this group fully operational . My hope would be that we could engage the Csos and everyone else to work out some of those details before actually initiate any sort of transfer.",168,,
784,0.97,8421.746,8423.248,Yeah.,169,,
785,0.97,8423.248,8438.53,Ithink we are all sensitive to that and appreciate the desire to want to have a conversation in a way that facilitates resolution to the policy question perhaps before we engage in the mechanics of a transfer.,169,,
786,0.97,8438.53,8446.271,I appreciate you finding that for us.,169,,
787,0.97,8446.271,8448.039,"Madam chair, I don't have any additional questions.",169,,
788,0.97,8448.039,8450.175,Thank you for giving me an opportunity to explore that area.,169,,
789,0.97,8450.175,8451.309,"Thank you, Council President.",170,,
790,0.97,8451.309,8497.622,"Chair Herbold, I don't see any additional hands . colleagues, if you have hands before Councilmember Herbold closes this out, please let us know . I would also like to add to the conversation we just had that while the conversation about transferring out individuals could be better positioned in Non-Spd roles, it wasn't done immediately . It was a process put into place so that we could move individuals once the Department has stood out . I think there is a process underway and I would appreciate again the interim director being with us as we talk about the new functions under the CSC see and I know that we will continue to talk about where additional ones can be placed.",170,,
791,0.97,8497.622,8512.937,I appreciate the answers from Socci and Council President Gonzalez about where the conversation may have evolved.,170,,
792,0.97,8512.937,8532.857,There was a point in time of the conversation with Csos and I am cognizant how fast the National conversation around these issues has changed . I am looking forward to getting feedback from the diverse Stakeholders including labor about how best we can provide these alternatives and where they are best placed.,170,,
793,0.97,8532.857,8537.929,I did have a question about slide number four.,170,,
794,0.97,8537.929,8540.164,You don't have to put it up.,170,,
795,0.97,8540.164,8547.272,I just wanted to Orient folks back to the CSO conversation we were having.,170,,
796,0.97,8547.272,8554.779,This build on the Council President's line of questions.,170,,
797,0.97,8554.779,8560.051,"I want to make sure that as a follow-up on some of the CSO questions, I believe there was additional data you will compile for us.",170,,
798,0.97,8560.051,8584.876,"I wanted to specifically ask if we could include in our feedback about the portfolio of the work that Csos have, if we could get an understanding how and when they are deployed and if there are any specific response abilities, or if that is something that is written down as a protocol and process.",170,,
799,0.97,8584.876,8586.878,I would like to see if that is written anywhere.,170,,
800,0.97,8586.878,8599.424,And then the CSO portfolio you sort of described as being similar to what has always been . I would like to get that in writing as you think about responding to the questions that the Council President already asked.,170,,
801,0.97,8599.424,8606.597,"And Council--I'm sorry, Dr.",170,,
802,0.97,8606.597,8610.501,Fisher . did you have a question?,170,,
803,0.97,8610.501,8611.402,"Oh, great.",170,,
804,0.97,8611.402,8682.907,"Councilmember Herbold, I don't want to steal what you have been really pressing on, but I want to underscore it, if I might . As we were preparing for this presentation as well along with Councilmember Herbold and other members of the committee here, I know that many people have been looking at the National Institute for criminal justice reform, or Nick Jr. as we have been calling it . There have been a significant percentage of calls that were currently being responded to by officials when it could be done without SPD involvement and I want to make sure we go back to Councilmember Herbold's line of questioning to explain whether or not there is any movement in this proposed budget in front of us to reduce the number of officers who are currently responding to that 12% of calls where there was agreed-upon differences or responses that could be handled by an Alternaive response starting now.",170,,
805,0.97,8682.907,8685.91,"Councilmember Herbold, if you would like to add to that, please do.",170,,
806,0.97,8685.91,8690.882,I wanted to jump right back to the question you have been asking for the past two days.,170,,
807,0.97,8690.882,8714.238,"The only thing I would add, considering we are inflating the universe of calls that the Nick Jr. report said Hey, we think those calls were around 50% and don't necessarily need a police Department or police officer response.",171,,
808,0.97,8714.238,8734.325,"I am concerned that we are Conflating that larger percentage with the smaller percentage, the 12% which represents only 28 call types that the executive agreed with and said we agree that in the near term, we should work to divert those 140,000 calls a year.",171,,
809,0.97,8734.325,8757.181,The triage one program as it looks now is proposing to divert think it is about a fifth or a sixth of those 140 hours of calls represented by that 28 call types.,171,,
810,0.97,8757.181,8771.095,"Earlier Julie Kline said they want to do analysis, but my understanding was you would do that with the universe of call types and Nick Jr. said they were possible to divert.",171,,
811,0.97,8771.095,8787.979,"That is great work here I want that were to happen, but if there is indeed a Subset of 28 call types that are low hanging fruit that we all agree don't need a sworn officer response, I want to get working on that right now.",171,,
812,0.97,8787.979,8798.556,That is the only clarity I would offer and perhaps I am just making the question more muddy and I apologize if I am.,171,,
813,0.97,8798.556,8800.525,No.,172,,
814,0.97,8800.525,8839.163,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda and vice chair Herbold . I know you and I have talked about this before . I will try to Reexplain the thought process . Maybe the thought process needs to be different . When we got the Nick Jr. report, you know as it clearly States, their analysis looked at the high level call type, what the name says as well as how often someone was arrested and they also matched up with did that call types seem to be related and whether that was a misdemeanor, felony, or a serious violent felony.",172,,
815,0.97,8839.163,8843.434,Those are the factors they took in when they divided stuff up.,172,,
816,0.97,8843.434,8874.098,"When we first got that, we looked at it and on that same level, these 28 names sound like generally something that the only questionable one we have always highlighted is disturbance . that one is slightly, located here there are four different ways of how disturbance is logged in a call . They have different subtypes and disturbance in and of itself is a very broad category.",172,,
817,0.97,8874.098,8905.796,"But then as we continue to look into the report and as we engage Dr. Albert, we were sort of turned onto this idea that there is a way that it has been done in other countries . It has never been done in the U.S., but there is a methodology to do it and we have been talking with folks who can support us to do that where for my sense from a methodological standpoint, it makes sense to do it to all of the calls . The number of calls doesn't affect the analysis.",172,,
818,0.97,8905.796,8913.704,You run the same numbers through to make sure we are not at a main level missing one of these call types.,172,,
819,0.97,8913.704,8916.941,People tend to get hurt a lot.,172,,
820,0.97,8916.941,8918.943,"When officers get there, there is someone injured a lot.",172,,
821,0.97,8918.943,8920.011,I am making those up.,172,,
822,0.97,8920.011,8929.153,"I don't know what they could be . The idea is to construct how often, based on data, is there harm?",172,,
823,0.97,8929.153,8930.554,There is a whole science on harm.,172,,
824,0.97,8930.554,8932.156,Harm is not just to a person.,172,,
825,0.97,8932.156,8948.439,There is a broader harm . that is what we prefer to do to make sure we are not placing anyone in any sort of unintended risk or liability by sending someone to a call that on face value and name value seems like it is always going to be safe.,172,,
826,0.97,8948.439,8950.675,"If we look at the data, maybe it is not.",172,,
827,0.97,8950.675,8966.557,"We have had those discussions for years about the welfare checks and fire and SPD both agreed these calls, when we get there, sometimes no one is even there.",172,,
828,0.97,8966.557,8968.359,"When we get there, we are not really necessary.",172,,
829,0.97,8968.359,8976.867,"I think from Julia's other point, maybe we can--I need to talk with our data folks, but could we do this risk analysis quickly on just these 28?",172,,
830,0.97,8976.867,8980.504,Does that work?,172,,
831,0.97,8980.504,8985.609,"Will that slow stuff down, or is not really a big deal?",172,,
832,0.97,8985.609,8994.051,"We will also do the labor discussion and missing property, I believe there is an issue about other folks taking possession.",172,,
833,0.97,8994.051,8999.023,Those are the checks we want to do on the group.,172,,
834,0.97,8999.023,9002.026,They were in the Nick Jr.,172,,
835,0.97,9002.026,9005.529,National Institute of this.,172,,
836,0.97,9005.529,9021.746,"Face value, Yeah I could see why you would ask . I think we should just do the due diligence . If we want to push faster, we can see if we can on these 28.",172,,
837,0.97,9021.746,9022.546,They look pretty simple.,172,,
838,0.97,9022.546,9024.782,That was the complication here.,172,,
839,0.97,9024.782,9039.83,"Methodologically, I think it makes sense to apply the plans to all of the call types but if you want to look at each 28 differently, we can try to Subset those out and get a sense.",172,,
840,0.97,9039.83,9045.136,"Yeah, and that is what we discussed last time we talked.",173,,
841,0.97,9045.136,9048.172,You would take a look at whether or not it made sense to phase it.,173,,
842,0.97,9048.172,9079.27,"I just want to say there is urgency not just because we are Reimagining policing and we want to reduce police contact when it is not necessary, but there is urgency because the number of officers we have to respond to 911 calls is greatly reduced . If we could get them off of those calls if they do not need to be responding, we need to do that quickly.",173,,
843,0.97,9079.27,9089.914,"In doing so, we can reduce those 911 priority call response times and get them back to where they need to be.",173,,
844,0.97,9089.914,9090.915,Right.,174,,
845,0.97,9090.915,9111.936,"To one of your other areas you like to focus on, we have been pushing and working with the CSC see about changing the language on the Online reporting tool to encourage additional Online reporting.",174,,
846,0.97,9111.936,9114.205,There is language about if you know a suspect.,174,,
847,0.97,9114.205,9116.807,"Yeah, the person was in a red sweater.",174,,
848,0.97,9116.807,9120.444,That doesn't help . You don't know who the person is.,174,,
849,0.97,9120.444,9138.162,"That doesn't count . one or two other Wordings where we think you might not get follow-up . If you file Online, there is no guarantee you will talk with a detective . There is no guarantee you will talk with a detective in any case necessarily.",174,,
850,0.97,9138.162,9149.34,I think we want to clarify that to encourage people who don't really feel they need to see an officer face-to-face to report Online if they can . I think that will help there.,174,,
851,0.97,9149.34,9152.843,I know you have talked with folks nationally about the offload.,174,,
852,0.97,9152.843,9168.192,"Yeah, I think we are very open to making sure officers are going to where the officers need to be . We don't want to send someone to a call in the officer needed to be at accidentally.",174,,
853,0.97,9168.192,9180.804,We want to be diligent but totally agreed that it cannot take years . part of this budget and this analytic work to develop it and test it to make sure it works . I think we are on the same path.,174,,
854,0.97,9180.804,9187.344,"It might be slightly different on the Timeline, but I don't think it is a huge difference.",174,,
855,0.97,9191.849,9197.821,"Councilmembers, additional comments or questions?",175,,
856,0.97,9197.821,9203.327,I see Councilmember Pedersen and Councilmember Herbold.,175,,
857,0.97,9203.327,9207.831,"Councilmember Herbold, you still have the Mic.",175,,
858,0.97,9207.831,9208.832,Did I cut you off?,175,,
859,0.97,9208.832,9210.601,"No, that was your question.",176,,
860,0.97,9210.601,9212.503,You are right!,177,,
861,0.97,9212.503,9213.304,That was my question.,177,,
862,0.97,9213.304,9219.41,"As we talked about, we will come to you at the end.",177,,
863,0.97,9219.41,9228.452,I will go to Councilmember Pedersen and then I will come back.,177,,
864,0.97,9228.452,9234.425,Councilmember Pedersen?,177,,
865,0.97,9234.425,9235.059,Thank you.,178,,
866,0.97,9235.059,9237.861,You hear about alternatives to different types of responses before we got to SPD.,178,,
867,0.97,9237.861,9256.38,"I want to reiterate my support for Scaling up alternatives to not only prevention, but also emergency responses . Now that we're talking about SPD's budget here, I wanted to make sure we addressed--because I didn't see this in the Powerpoint.",178,,
868,0.97,9256.38,9281.739,"In the budget it says there is a net loss of 193 officers since the beginning of 2020 and what I had read in various statements was that they were trying to--and I'm approximating, but they are hoping to hire 125 but they might end up losing 90 so you have a debt of 35 approximately.",178,,
869,0.97,9281.739,9302.926,"When we say a net gain of 35, that is from the revised after having lost 193. in a way, if we compare January of 2020 to January 2022, wouldn't that be a net loss even after you gain 35 net?",178,,
870,0.97,9302.926,9313.037,Approximately? okay . I just wanted to set that context and I don't think there is a magic number for the number of officers.,178,,
871,0.97,9313.037,9342.666,"As Councilmember Herbold was saying, there is coverage . It is important that we have that basic coverage for now . because it takes a long time to hire officers, even Laterals need to be trained up to the training standards . could you tell me a little bit more about what SPD would be doing to retain the officers that we have?",178,,
872,0.97,9342.666,9357.081,That might be one of the most efficient ways to keep the 24-7 911 response.,178,,
873,0.97,9357.081,9357.548,Great.,179,,
874,0.97,9357.548,9359.75,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",179,,
875,0.97,9359.75,9361.385,I think you definitely had the math right.,179,,
876,0.97,9361.385,9362.886,Angela can check the numbers.,179,,
877,0.97,9362.886,9370.894,Part of that is the capacity to train . 125 would be a record number.,179,,
878,0.97,9370.894,9386.31,"We had demonstrated we can do it with the Academy . The unknown is how many people apply and qualify . as the chief has said, we have folks that have been waiting in the wings.",179,,
879,0.97,9386.31,9391.014,We could push people through.,179,,
880,0.97,9391.014,9394.084,Our holdup is getting enough people to apply.,179,,
881,0.97,9394.084,9405.496,I know that you asked about the retention but part of the equation is getting more people.,179,,
882,0.97,9405.496,9409.733,"If we can hit 125, that is ambitious as the chief mentioned in his comments, but it has been Ramping up.",179,,
883,0.97,9409.733,9411.535,It takes time to get the machine running again.,179,,
884,0.97,9411.535,9416.24,We do hope to get that number.,179,,
885,0.97,9416.24,9429.019,"You know, there is a little bit of formula to it . I think as the year has gone on, we had 15.",179,,
886,0.97,9429.019,9446.47,The early separations have slowed down . We may be better able to more closely predict the numbers.,179,,
887,0.97,9446.47,9460.05,"We are having more folks able to retire than leaving early, which was the issue in 2020 and the first half of 2021.",179,,
888,0.97,9460.05,9462.753,The estimate still may be high.,179,,
889,0.97,9462.753,9480.804,"We will have to monitor that month-to-month . in terms of retention, one of the biggest things and items in the recommendation from the team was the wellness schedule . I know the chief and others and labor have been discussing an alternative shift schedule.",179,,
890,0.97,9480.804,9500.991,I know the staffing is a constraint to that . There is a minimum number of officers we need to do the for 10. we have to keep them moving because we don't want to lose so many folks . that doesn't make sense anymore.,179,,
891,0.97,9500.991,9513.971,I think we have heard from enough people that the other model is a big boost to wellness . We had a boost to recruitment and retention . We have also been trying to increase our wellness services.,179,,
892,0.97,9513.971,9521.512,We have been trying to have mental health professional access at all of the precincts so they will not have to find a resource.,179,,
893,0.97,9521.512,9527.551,The resource find you.,179,,
894,0.97,9527.551,9561.285,"One of the other things in the 2019 report, really investing in the Department . not buying equipment . It was really about getting people access to building their skill set so that they could have a vision and career path within the Department and potentially after the Department . a lot of that is having access to training . As Angela mentioned, you have to have certain training to do certain jobs.",179,,
895,0.97,9561.285,9576.3,"Our major crash investigations, that is a significant training that takes time and is costly to know all of the math and science and impact and angle and speed.",179,,
896,0.97,9576.3,9595.218,"People have to be certified to do those, but there are also personal development, leadership development and the more we can offer that, which we have been doing, the more we can show the employees that the Department wants them to grow within the Department to gain new skills.",179,,
897,0.97,9595.218,9604.328,The city and the Department are willing to invest in that and that is a huge part of attention.,179,,
898,0.97,9604.328,9608.599,There are items that can help there.,179,,
899,0.97,9608.599,9628.919,"We have been posting on Socials and continue to acknowledge the work in any field, people like to feel valued . Just continuing those efforts . The reason they are in it is being recognized and people appreciate what they do.",179,,
900,0.97,9628.919,9634.758,Thank you.,180,,
901,0.97,9634.758,9635.359,Of course.,181,,
902,0.97,9635.359,9637.127,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Pedersen.",181,,
903,0.97,9637.127,9638.161,Okay.,181,,
904,0.97,9638.161,9648.005,"Councilmember Herbold, I am not seeing any additional questions, so if you would like to finalize our questions here for today, you're more than welcome to.",181,,
905,0.97,9648.005,9662.986,"Just real quick, I am not getting a clear read of whether or not we are going to be able to implement this or not.",182,,
906,0.97,9662.986,9664.488,"It is such a high priority, right?",182,,
907,0.97,9664.488,9671.161,It has been for years.,182,,
908,0.97,9671.161,9673.397,I know central staff has asked lots of questions.,182,,
909,0.97,9673.397,9679.269,We are getting mixed messages around the staffing levels being a barrier.,182,,
910,0.97,9679.269,9690.414,Are we going to be able to afford 410S?,182,,
911,0.97,9690.414,9694.718,I will have to check in with my folks.,183,,
912,0.97,9694.718,9695.318,Fair enough.,184,,
913,0.97,9695.318,9696.753,"You touched upon this, Dr.",184,,
914,0.97,9696.753,9697.921,Fisher.,184,,
915,0.97,9697.921,9700.924,I am a be going to frame it a little bit differently.,184,,
916,0.97,9700.924,9708.131,You acknowledged the hiring plan is completely appropriate.,184,,
917,0.97,9708.131,9715.205,I just want to put a little bit of meat on what it means to be based on the years.,184,,
918,0.97,9715.205,9724.147,I think we had anticipated separation of 85 fully trained officers in 2020.,184,,
919,0.97,9724.147,9727.617,"That is low, right?",184,,
920,0.97,9727.617,9731.655,We haven't seen a number as low as 85 since 2017.,184,,
921,0.97,9731.655,9737.561,"On the hiring side, the goal is 125.",184,,
922,0.97,9737.561,9746.269,That has never happened even when we had hiring bonuses in 2019. we were able to hire 108.,184,,
923,0.97,9746.269,9764.387,"Given those trends, why would it be--why wouldn't it be advisable for us to hold another five or so million in reserve to see what happens with the hiring plan?",184,,
924,0.97,9764.387,9775.499,"I think it would start . The most recent normal year, 2018 there were broader issues around separations.",185,,
925,0.97,9775.499,9784.908,"In 2019, we started to see that recover . the beginning of 2020, we were seeing record low separations up until June.",185,,
926,0.97,9784.908,9793.583,Month by month we were starting to think we were going to have a record hiring year in 2020 until the second half of the year.,185,,
927,0.97,9793.583,9804.427,I think we see the Uptick that we saw . hiring went on pause and it takes time to come back.,185,,
928,0.97,9804.427,9822.445,We worked through that and the process is running again and it is Online now . individuals can take it all the time instead of waiting for those sessions.,185,,
929,0.97,9822.445,9830.954,We have gotten the electronics or external background process to speed that up.,185,,
930,0.97,9830.954,9838.328,We reported hearing lots of folks getting frustrated with the time.,185,,
931,0.97,9838.328,9839.563,I'm not sure it is implemented.,185,,
932,0.97,9839.563,9868.391,I will have to check with hr but you can have the plan electronically managed . It was a lot of paper . also with the chief's proposal around this relational policing Pre-Academy training where we would hire people almost immediately and they would go through this Pretraining before they started the Academy so there wouldn't be this pause we lose people to other agencies.,185,,
933,0.97,9868.391,9882.572,I think all of that combined gives us the hope that we can hit that number . There is no guarantee . I don't think we have ever hit the exact estimate . It is a forecast.,185,,
934,0.97,9882.572,9910.433,"I think seeing where we were, we had just launched new very targeted radio ads Online . I don't how many people listen to just plain radio anymore in this age group, but if you are willing to sign up, chairwoman Mosqueda will take you.",185,,
935,0.97,9910.433,9915.538,I think that we are doing what we can do to expand the reach.,185,,
936,0.97,9915.538,9930.353,"A system is in place to be able to process more and we think if we can we retention efforts, unless people want to leave early, I think we may have pushed a lot of people.",185,,
937,0.97,9930.353,9933.556,"If they fold early, they fold early.",185,,
938,0.97,9933.556,9945.435,Folks are in that position and they think all of that combines together and we think it could be lower and we could hit hiring numbers that are little higher than we have done.,185,,
939,0.97,9945.435,9949.439,"Again, it is a forecast and it is an ambitious one.",185,,
940,0.97,9949.439,9952.075,We hope we can hit it.,185,,
941,0.97,9952.075,9958.181,Thank you.,186,,
942,0.97,9958.181,9976.266,"I would also like additional detail on the technology . with the $5 million, I would like to know whether or not the expenditures are necessary or which expenditures are helpful for the development of alternative police response.",186,,
943,0.97,9976.266,9987.344,The context for that being of course we approve 2.25 million in additional technology funding just a month ago in the midyear supplemental.,186,,
944,0.97,9987.344,10019.509,"I want to understand this $5 million technology add within the context of things we want to do because of policy or have to do . and Lastly, we have talked a little bit about the feeling that we would like a little more transparency in the police Department's budget.",186,,
945,0.97,10019.509,10037.36,I appreciate Angela's remarks earlier about trying to get the funds as we intend to expand them this year rather than coming to us midyear and asking for those funds to be moved.,186,,
946,0.97,10037.36,10062.786,"I don't know if one thing is leading to lack of transparency in another area, but specifically what the budget calls salary savings, on the presentation you can add up the things that say Oh, this is supported by salary savings so it has no impact to the budget.",186,,
947,0.97,10062.786,10078.201,"Adding that up, it comes to about $7 million but we don't have anywhere in the budget where it says these with a salary savings in total and here is how we decided to spend them . that is different than what we had in the 2021 budget.",186,,
948,0.97,10078.201,10099.322,"In the 2021 budget proposed by the Mayor, she specifically called out $15.8 million in salary savings to be redirected to other priorities . I would really like to see that total number of salary Savings and where it all goes.",186,,
949,0.97,10099.322,10102.992,We can totally send you the technology breakdown.,187,,
950,0.97,10102.992,10110.733,"Just for high level rather than going through it now, some of it is continuing the work you already helped us find . It wasn't going to be done in that year.",187,,
951,0.97,10110.733,10114.537,There is more to do.,187,,
952,0.97,10114.537,10125.748,"A portion of that is very specifically about having analytic capacity and tools to do the reporting that has sort of become standard, but we will relay this on to you.",187,,
953,0.97,10125.748,10146.87,"There are a few projects that are going beyond sort of where we are and trying to push forward the whole feel on how we measure and manage around quality, inequity, disparity, and really making those ANALYTICS part of our management style and meetings.",187,,
954,0.97,10146.87,10152.375,We want to build the tools to be able to do that.,187,,
955,0.97,10152.375,10155.578,That is part of that work that we want to do.,187,,
956,0.97,10155.578,10166.389,Some of this is doing research around this sort of Risk-Based demand model on alternatives.,187,,
957,0.97,10166.389,10182.105,"We will send you the whole breakdown, but some of it is continuing the projects we are already working on and some are new projects that are on our horizon that we think continue to move us in the right direction.",187,,
958,0.97,10182.105,10184.207,I will let Angela handle the budget part.,187,,
959,0.97,10184.207,10185.875,Yeah.,188,,
960,0.97,10185.875,10193.383,So you are correct that there is much more salary available then represented on this overview slide.,188,,
961,0.97,10193.383,10202.525,I have already promised a full breakdown of how that money has been reallocated or redirected.,188,,
962,0.97,10202.525,10234.257,"In some cases for separation pay and some of the items we discussed at the midyear, those benefit costs didn't require a redistribution . those aren't represented but a portion of our salary savings, we are looking at likely between $18 million and $19 million in salary savings next year . a portion of that is funded in community safety investments that we talked about.",188,,
963,0.97,10234.257,10260.65,"I think that is about 3.6 million reduced off the top and from there, we have accounted for the funding needed for separation pay, the funding needed for deferred COMP, the civilian parks cost, the continuation that we discussed at midyear . again, we will provide a full breakdown on how the money has been allocated in the budget.",188,,
964,0.97,10260.65,10270.393,"Because these are transfers where we didn't actually need to transfer money, you are correct that it is not clearly represented in the budget.",188,,
965,0.97,10270.393,10279.702,We have already been discussing how we can map it out for everyone so it is very clear in the supplemental information we provide.,188,,
966,0.97,10279.702,10283.773,Thank you.,189,,
967,0.97,10283.773,10286.609,Thank you very much.,189,,
968,0.97,10286.609,10292.515,"Madam vice chair, I appreciate your line of questions.",189,,
969,0.97,10292.515,10312.402,"All of my colleagues that asked questions today, I want to thank you for your engagement and I will have a few instructions for those who have questions and did not get a chance to ask them today . If you have more questions, we are happy to help answer those.",189,,
970,0.97,10312.402,10319.308,I do want to thank members of SPD and the city budget office.,189,,
971,0.97,10319.308,10330.453,I want to remind us all that this is tough work . This is Transformational work . This is work being discussed at the International level and cities across this country.,189,,
972,0.97,10330.453,10341.264,We know this conversation has been Extradited and reignited in many ways because of how many people turned out in the streets last year.,189,,
973,0.97,10341.264,10353.142,"I want to remind everyone why we are having these discussions, especially as we think about George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and the thousands of people we saw taking to the streets and a call for a moment of racial reckoning.",189,,
974,0.97,10353.142,10382.305,"We are all working towards a national conversation that is playing a very locally about how we can Reimagine public safety and reinvest in community support services so that people don't have to interact and engage in violent situations or interact with the police in the first place so people have stability, health, and safety.",189,,
975,0.97,10382.305,10404.66,"We know across the nation there have been growing incidence of crime and we are committed to making sure our city is a safe place, a safe place for residents, small businesses, Torres, and especially centering ourselves on making sure this is a safe place for black, indigenous, and people of color to feel safe in their communities as well . We have done a number of things in the past few years and many of them are reflected in our discussion today.",189,,
976,0.97,10404.66,10424.947,"Mostly I think it is important to note the continuation of this Council within the Mayor's budget . We will continue to do it and some of that is reflected in our discussion in front of us of the budgeting process, which we talked about today.",189,,
977,0.97,10424.947,10444.2,"$10 million went into community safety . As we discussed yesterday, there is a continuation to the tune of $10 million so making sure those investments are kept whole in the upcoming year and future year has been greatly appreciated.",189,,
978,0.97,10444.2,10461.684,"We saw the $3 million and $4 million in community safety initiative, which has established three community safety hubs to address issues of violence which has been Plaguing our nation . I really appreciated the discussion today.",189,,
979,0.97,10461.684,10471.26,We are Rightsizing our investments in traditional public safety.,189,,
980,0.97,10471.26,10478.1,"As we continue to do this, there are still national headlines, like the ones we got from the New York Times just as he began this conversation at 3:30 today.",189,,
981,0.97,10478.1,10483.005,Note the previous number of people that died.,189,,
982,0.97,10483.005,10523.913,This is not about being punitive in any way . It is truly about trying to center our conversations on how to do that right investment and make sure that public safety is addressed . that means freeing up officers to focus on high Acuity cases that the Council President talked about and reducing the need for officers to have to spend their time showing up when what they should be doing is focusing on those cases and letting mental health go to the calls . We will continue this work . We know it is Transformational as we talked about at the beginning of this meeting.,189,,
983,0.97,10523.913,10525.448,"It is a movement, not a moment.",189,,
984,0.97,10525.448,10551.04,"We want to make sure we are underlying issues at high rates of injury and violence and also making sure that we are investing in solutions for greater housing stability and food security . with that, we know it is going to be a few tough conversations, but I appreciate you for being here.",189,,
985,0.97,10551.04,10567.99,"Dr. Fisher, Angela Socci, we know where to find you . as the chair of public safety noted, these conversations have been ongoing and we anticipate there to be a back and forth dialogue with you as well.",189,,
986,0.97,10567.99,10577.099,"Angela, we know how quickly you all have been working to respond to our questions.",189,,
987,0.97,10577.099,10583.205,There will be more to come but this is a good Foundational understanding for us today.,189,,
988,0.97,10583.205,10596.786,We can address the traditional policy concerns and think about how we invest in community safety to reduce incidence and unsafe situations across the board . that is our goal.,189,,
