159,0.97,1014.646,1044.443,"We know it is very late in session and the Federal dollars our new and we are not totally knowing . My understanding is that there is about $700 million in reserves, and part of the Ascus to ask the legislators to dip into part of the reserves that they were holding specifically from the Federal assistance dollars, to then be able to Reallocate this for strategic acquisition and housing and homelessness support.",36,,
160,0.97,1044.443,1045.444,Is that accurate?,36,,

162,0.97,1059.725,1065.464,I think that the budget writers have a significant amount of information.,37,,
163,0.97,1065.464,1088.754,"While we do know the House made a lot of indications about where they would like to see Federal money spent, the Senate on the other hand decided to wait, hoping that the Federal government would provide more guidance about how the money could be used specifically.",37,,
164,0.97,1088.754,1103.168,"Over the weekend, I've talked to several legislators and they agree that there is certainly--there is some latitude.",37,,
165,0.97,1103.168,1110.476,There could be some things that are moved around in order to meet our request.,37,,
166,0.97,1110.476,1114.179,"So, I hope that answers your question.",37,,
167,0.97,1114.179,1117.583,I do know there is some money for reserves.,37,,
168,0.97,1117.583,1126.992,"There's also the question of whether things could be--when things are spent, whether they are spent in the first year or the second year.",37,,
169,0.97,1126.992,1129.862,I know they are under the same parameters that we are as a sitter.,37,,
170,0.97,1129.862,1132.464,We are each receiving a pot of money.,37,,
171,0.97,1132.464,1137.302,We are only allowed to use half of the money in the first year.,37,,
172,0.97,1137.302,1145.944,"So, there is a chance to defer some expenses to the second year, depending on spending plans for programs et cetera.",37,,
173,0.97,1145.944,1148.08,"Okay, thanks.",38,,
174,0.97,1148.08,1172.905,"I want to acknowledge that this is a pretty late ask, and try to signal our support to the legislators, both for the addition that we are asking a $400 million across the state, but also to recognize that they have, it sounds like on the House side, been pretty specific on trying to identify where the Federal dollars should go.",38,,
175,0.97,1172.905,1189.555,"I appreciate the dollars to have some flexibility in Ãšdeference to legislators to identify where the dollars could come from, and in our efforts to take to make sure that this $400 million is funded, being flexible on our end on where that comes from.",38,,
176,0.97,1189.555,1195.861,Hopefully we can all continue to send a message that this is also a cost saving measure as we get more folks into housing.,38,,
177,0.97,1195.861,1202.768,Obviously will cost the state and local housing jurisdictions less.,38,,
178,0.97,1202.768,1206.038,Our distal notes are not dynamic enough to show those kind of cost savings.,38,,
179,0.97,1206.038,1209.041,I know that may help with some of the legislative members.,38,,
180,0.97,1209.041,1214.947,Also to emphasize again that this they Win/Win.,38,,
181,0.97,1214.947,1222.387,"If those are positive things, for business and property owners, as much as it is for healthy economies.",38,,
182,0.97,1222.387,1224.656,"Housing economies, and social services.",38,,
183,0.97,1224.656,1235.801,"Look forward to working with you more, but I know it's late so I wanted to identify if we had been pushing for a certain area for that to come from.",38,,
184,0.97,1235.801,1237.069,Every dollar is important in this juncture.,38,,
185,0.97,1237.069,1244.176,I'm also happy about the budgets that came forward and I know that this is going to be good.,38,,
186,0.97,1244.176,1252.317,We certainly don't want to do one good thing at the cost of another good thing for sure.,39,,
187,0.97,1252.317,1272.638,"I think you brought up a good point that I don't think we had clearly made this morning, Councilmember Mosqueda, one of the reasons we are pushing so hard for this is that we know that there are opportunities in the real estate market right now that will be very unlikely to exist even six months from now.",39,,
188,0.97,1272.638,1280.545,"So, we are trying to capitalize on a moment that we didn't really capitalize on as much as we should have during the last recession.",39,,
189,0.97,1280.545,1294.393,Trying to learn from the passed and make sure that we can bring as many people inside and increase our stock of affordable housing when we have an opportunity right now.,39,,
190,0.97,1294.393,1298.63,"Okay, so, moving on.",40,,
191,0.97,1298.63,1301.266,I don't think there are any other questions.,40,,
192,0.97,1301.266,1303.268,Moving on to the more general housing bill report.,40,,
193,0.97,1303.268,1309.875,There is a lot of good news that has been happening.,40,,
194,0.97,1309.875,1313.645,"If you would just bear with me for a second, I have the wrong date of my notes up.",40,,
195,0.97,1313.645,1328.894,"[Laughter] House bill 1220, that would require planning for affordable housing and emergency shelter passed the Senate late Saturday evening inside of a Saturday night gift.",40,,
196,0.97,1328.894,1354.686,"The portions of the bill that would have changed zoning for where permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, and emergency shelter was allowed was changed a little bit and now States that a code city may not prohibit housing in either residential or housing hotel zones.",40,,
197,0.97,1354.686,1361.126,It also shall not prohibit emergency shelters in hotel zones unless an ordinance is adopted that allows for emergency shelter in the majority of zones in that district.,40,,
198,0.97,1361.126,1363.395,Within one mile of transit.,40,,
199,0.97,1363.395,1369.701,"So, some changes to that bill, but still overall I think a very good bill.",40,,
200,0.97,1369.701,1372.738,"The just cause Eviction bill, House bill 1236.",40,,
201,0.97,1372.738,1376.208,It also passed.,40,,
202,0.97,1376.208,1383.749,You will remember last week we had seen that bill get stalled and they were waiting to see what would happen.,40,,
203,0.97,1383.749,1397.529,There was an agreed-upon amendment for the bill that continues to allow the Probationary period of an initial tendency to allow a no cause Eviction with 60 days notice.,40,,
204,0.97,1397.529,1400.966,Similar to what was in the original bill.,40,,
205,0.97,1400.966,1404.035,The provisions are a little bit complicated.,40,,
206,0.97,1404.035,1417.849,"Rather than go into the very minute details here, what I'll agree to do is just provide a written update also in consultation with law, to keep me honest, that I will provide to the Council with all the details later on.",40,,
207,0.97,1417.849,1422.888,"Another part of the bill was that the property owners had asked for, was a delay of implementation of the bill.",40,,
208,0.97,1422.888,1426.391,For 3 months after the Eviction moratorium.,40,,
209,0.97,1426.391,1435.901,In order to allow anyone who signed a month-to-month lease to move on to a Probationary six month or more lease under the bill.,40,,
210,0.97,1435.901,1438.77,These amendments were necessary to pass the bill.,40,,
211,0.97,1438.77,1453.919,Still a wonderful increase across the state to protect tenants that gives similar protections that tenants have in Seattle to across the state which is really quite historic.,40,,
212,0.97,1453.919,1465.197,"House bill 1277, the bill that would increase the document recording fees by $100 is actually--it was up for executive session on Saturday.",40,,
213,0.97,1465.197,1469.201,The meeting got kind of waylaid with the Blake decision.,40,,
214,0.97,1469.201,1474.105,They moved the executive session on that bill to today.,40,,
215,0.97,1474.105,1475.674,It was merely just a timing issue.,40,,
216,0.97,1475.674,1477.142,No cause for concern.,40,,
217,0.97,1477.142,1483.949,That bill may have been exec'd while we were talking here this morning.,40,,
218,0.97,1483.949,1486.718,I will provide an update there.,40,,
219,0.97,1486.718,1498.997,"Then, Senate bill 5160, that provides tenant protections at the end of the Eviction moratorium, passed the house with an amendment that would prevent the extension of the Eviction moratorium.",40,,
220,0.97,1498.997,1517.182,"There is some work underway to see what might be done about that because there is some concern that in order to get the right to Council provision established, and underway, that they might need a little bit more than a June 30th Eviction deadline.",40,,
221,0.97,1517.182,1517.782,Expiration.,40,,
222,0.97,1517.782,1518.85,I'll also keep you posted there.,40,,
223,0.97,1518.85,1521.887,"Still, this is also a historic bill.",40,,
224,0.97,1521.887,1528.36,We would be the first date in Washington to pass right to counsel statewide.,40,,
225,0.97,1528.36,1530.161,If this bill does going to law.,40,,
226,0.97,1530.161,1531.997,In a few weeks.,40,,
227,0.97,1531.997,1534.799,That's really quite amazing.,40,,

456,0.97,2830.294,2836.8,Just want to provide a little bit of information about my own inquiries about this.,59,,
457,0.97,2836.8,2848.612,"In September, I wrote to chief Diaz to inquire about the status of former Mayor Burgess' executive order of September 27th--2017.",59,,

464,0.97,2911.775,2914.878,The status is two fold.,59,,
465,0.97,2914.878,2921.385,It is both regarding the Detracting of off-duty hours.,59,,
466,0.97,2921.385,2925.455,As well as changes in policy limiting off-duty work.,59,,
467,0.97,2925.455,2943.006,"As it relates specifically to the tracking, the response received from the chief was that the work schedule and Timekeeping project system could support the work . meaning supporting the work of tracking the hours.",59,,
468,0.97,2943.006,2950.213,The work scheduled Timekeeping project is a technological project that the police Department is undertaking right now.,59,,
469,0.97,2950.213,2954.484,The chief goes on to say that it is not scoped to do so.,59,,

472,0.97,2966.63,2977.14,"It goes on to say that the work schedule and Timekeeping system was scoped to ensure it could support the work, but the project is not currently incorporating it.",59,,
473,0.97,2977.14,3001.164,"Instead, they are working on logging off-duty work in the computer aided dispatch system and do not have sufficient resources without the work schedule and Timekeeping system to link up off-duty hours reported in the CAD to aggregate them for current total thresholds.",59,,
474,0.97,3001.164,3013.577,"The response goes on to say that officers must also currently logged their off-duty work in the blue teams system, which feeds an internal dashboard that is reviewed monthly.",59,,

476,0.97,3015.445,3036.099,"As a relates specifically to limiting the number of off-duty hours officers can do and regulating that area, the chief goes on to say, in early 2019 it was determined that the current contract places limits on the changes that can be made to the off-duty process.",59,,
477,0.97,3036.099,3044.608,Any additional changes in the administration of off-duty work must be addressed in future labor negotiations.,59,,

656,0.97,4200.262,4205.734,I did withdraw this amendment due to questions.,68,,
657,0.97,4205.734,4208.604,I'm still doing some research about how this ties into additional state-level discussions.,68,,
658,0.97,4208.604,4216.946,I think the concept was to Reallocate the $1.5 million that is going to Seattle public utilities and Seattle public light.,68,,
659,0.97,4216.946,4229.491,In recognition of the delinquent payments and back Odette that many in our city have.,68,,
660,0.97,4229.491,4233.996,Obviously we also want to make sure that those that owe the debt don't have that stress and burden holding over them.,68,,
661,0.97,4233.996,4235.23,Looking forward to learning more though.,68,,
662,0.97,4235.23,4244.106,I understand Seattle city light and Seattle public utilities sent a request to the state Legislature for an additional $100 million in Arpa funds.,68,,

665,0.97,4249.812,4262.191,I do have concerns about additional Federal dollars continuing to go to our public utilities that could be in competition with other leading organizations.,68,,
666,0.97,4262.191,4267.896,I also understand that there is specific dollars directly to the utilities.,68,,
667,0.97,4267.896,4269.698,$100 million was included in the House budget.,68,,
668,0.97,4269.698,4278.841,I think there's more information to speak out as we tried to figure out how that Hannah Smith go directly to those that are most in need.,68,,

673,0.97,4304.033,4307.469,I think there's questions to be answered about the dollar amount they are asking for from the state.,68,,

813,0.97,5231.292,5237.799,"Fortunately, the average Spu rates are expected to be lower than what was promised back in 2017 for these upcoming years.",73,,
814,0.97,5237.799,5248.509,Keeping rates low is important because rates are technically Regressive with lower income households paying a larger percentage of their household income for utility bills.,73,,
815,0.97,5248.509,5251.012,Other issues.,73,,
816,0.97,5251.012,5265.026,"I would like to echo the remarks by Councilmember Juarez applauding the Biden administration for canceling, for now, the hasty and irresponsible sale of the National Archives facility, which is located in district for.",73,,

831,0.97,5349.911,5352.38,This is stretching 2.7 miles.,73,,
832,0.97,5352.38,5356.017,This underground storage tunnel from Ballard to Wallingford.,73,,
833,0.97,5356.017,5360.521,This is a major project that has been planned over many years.,73,,

841,0.97,5406.567,5414.542,"And the almost completed redo of North East 43rd street, which leads into the University of Washington's main campus.",73,,
842,0.97,5414.542,5421.582,I continue to share the concern of 20 environmental and community organizations about the decision transportation officials made a few years ago to narrow Brooklyn Avenue.,73,,
843,0.97,5421.582,5426.687,Which Unfortunately Impedes access for more buses.,73,,
844,0.97,5426.687,5432.994,"Ideally Brooklyn Avenue would have remained wide enough to accommodate most buses, and provide seamless transfers from bus to light rail.",73,,
845,0.97,5432.994,5447.608,"As all the light rail stations open, our Seattle Department of Transportation will need to stay tightly coordinated with King County Metro to adjust bus routes based on rider feedback from the thousands who will be transferring from bus to light rail.",73,,

849,0.97,5478.906,5482.91,I believe this highlights one of the benefits of our hybrid counselor election system that includes representation by districts.,73,,

860,0.97,5517.812,5524.185,Appreciate your sending the letter about the potential overpayment.,75,,
861,0.97,5524.185,5533.961,When I had the chance to chair Seattle city light I also sent a letter to city light about concerns I was hearing about people being overcharged.,75,,
862,0.97,5533.961,5539.066,"Various charges coming in at $300, $600, even $1000 below what the expected amount was.",75,,
863,0.97,5539.066,5542.904,This was in 2018.,75,,
864,0.97,5542.904,5546.574,The auditors report did come back with some interesting findings.,75,,
865,0.97,5546.574,5550.111,A lot of the underlying issues I think still have to be addressed.,75,,
866,0.97,5550.111,5557.952,I'm wondering if you might have any Intel on whether or not something similar is starting to Percolate within Seattle public utilities.,75,,
867,0.97,5557.952,5568.095,A lot of folks in my neighborhood have had now three incidences of water being Brown as it comes out of their Faucets.,75,,
868,0.97,5568.095,5575.603,"I think because of that, more people are talk about the charges that they also are receiving.",75,,
869,0.97,5575.603,5577.638,Upwards of 300 and $400.,75,,
870,0.97,5577.638,5580.241,It's higher than expected.,75,,
871,0.97,5580.241,5585.346,That's just coming from some folks in my neighborhood.,75,,
872,0.97,5585.346,5596.324,I'm wondering if that is something to look into to see if there is higher than anticipated bills also being acquired in Seattle public utilities like we had experienced in Seattle city light two or three years ago.,75,,
873,0.97,5596.324,5599.56,Happy to look into that and have Seattle public utilities get back to us on that.,75,,
