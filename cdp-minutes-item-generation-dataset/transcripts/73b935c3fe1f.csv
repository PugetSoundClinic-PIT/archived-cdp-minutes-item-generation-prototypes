23,0.97,75.375,81.881,"If there are follow-up questions on items, we can always delay when the full council considers the items.",12,,
24,0.97,81.881,93.96,"For example, instead of sending an item to the September 20 Council, we can send it to a later one like October 4, for example.",12,,

32,0.97,124.324,124.757,Thank you.,15,,
33,0.97,124.757,129.629,"For folks watching, you can always Email the Council on these items.",15,,
34,0.97,129.629,145.044,I am going to quickly open and close the general comment period because we are not seeing anybody signed up for the public comment period for the transportation utilities committee this morning.,15,,
35,0.97,145.044,150.15,"Again, folks interested in Commenting on these items can send us Emails as well.",15,,
36,0.97,150.15,163.129,We will move on to the first item of business . will the clerk please read the short title of the first agenda item into the record?,15,,
37,0.97,163.129,164.597,"Agenda item 1, council bill 120160.",16,,
38,0.97,164.597,178.978,"An ordinance relating to the city light Department, adding a new section to chapter 21.49 of the Seattle municipal code to establish the renewable plus program . authorizing discussion and possible vote.",16,,
39,0.97,178.978,179.779,Thank you.,17,,
40,0.97,179.779,183.449,"Colleagues, we had an extended presentation on this Council bill during our previous committee meeting.",17,,
41,0.97,183.449,188.955,Today is an opportunity to ask any remaining questions before we vote on this proposal.,17,,
42,0.97,188.955,222.689,"As you will recall, this Council vote would expand the flexibility to contract with both electric power spires and large customers to increase the amount of sustainable renewable electricity . As we heard in the utilities presentation and discussion on August 18, this authority will make it possible to simulate purchase and supply significantly more green power as energy needs increase over time . The results are expected to provide both fiscal and environmental benefits for the city and its Ratepayers.",17,,
43,0.97,222.689,227.126,Our central staff analyst repaired a memorandum that was circulated earlier this week and posted on our agenda.,17,,
44,0.97,227.126,229.996,The memo further explains proposed program.,17,,
45,0.97,229.996,240.34,"I would like to give our central staff analyst an opportunity, if you wanted to highlight anything in the memo.",17,,
46,0.97,240.34,246.713,"We have our general manager of city light here, Debra Smith, and her team to ask questions about this renewable plus program.",17,,
47,0.97,246.713,250.65,"First, to our central staff analyst Eric, anything to share with us?",17,,
48,0.97,250.65,251.918,Thank you.,18,,
49,0.97,251.918,252.919,Good morning.,18,,
50,0.97,252.919,263.262,"I am Eric Mcconaghy from central staff . very briefly, I would add that the legislation would extend the contracting time for city light from five years to 20 years.",18,,
51,0.97,263.262,268.134,City light has five years of authority for contracting.,18,,
52,0.97,268.134,275.742,"While this was established, this legislation would establish the renewable plus program.",18,,
53,0.97,275.742,287.453,City light would come to Council in the future to have decisions upon a rate for renewable plus customers.,18,,
54,0.97,287.453,289.088,That is another decision to come the future.,18,,
55,0.97,289.088,291.09,Those are the key features I wanted to point out.,18,,
56,0.97,291.09,292.158,Thank you for the opportunity.,18,,
57,0.97,292.158,293.86,I am here if there are any questions.,18,,
58,0.97,293.86,299.666,Thank you for your memo to us.,19,,
59,0.97,299.666,306.305,I know some questions we had raised previously were about--we were excited about the concept but what were the risks to the city?,19,,
60,0.97,306.305,321.387,"Are we able to maximize public and if it's? as I hear you saying, because they will be coming back to set the rate, that is another chance to Revisit this.",19,,
61,0.97,321.387,328.428,"I will look for any Council member questions would also wanted to offer to city light, if you wanted to say anything further about the program.",20,,
62,0.97,328.428,335.601,"I can offer just a couple of comments, Councilmember Pedersen, chair Pedersen.",21,,
63,0.97,335.601,337.036,Thank you for your time today.,21,,
64,0.97,337.036,352.251,"It seems like in the last year and a half or so, we have not had as many opportunities as we probably would all like to put forth new programs and things that prepare us for the future.",21,,
65,0.97,352.251,353.853,This is just that.,21,,
66,0.97,353.853,365.131,Is super timely because as folks generally know--I personally am not going to spend $500 to go see Coldplay although I would love to but I hear the Livestreaming will be awesome.,21,,
67,0.97,365.131,372.772,We know that climate pledge arena is essentially done and we are already to start enjoying that.,21,,
68,0.97,372.772,385.351,That is a good example of one customer for whom the renewable plus program will allow them to meet their enhanced Sustainability goals.,21,,
69,0.97,385.351,415.415,This is a program that is in direct response to customer requests that we have been gone back through and made available in an equitable way to all customers who meet the guidelines in terms of size and type of load . We are very excited to be able to offer something that is new and that positions Seattle for the future and allows our particularly time it Conches customers the opportunity to explore this concept of Additivity.,21,,
70,0.97,415.415,416.048,That is important.,21,,
71,0.97,416.048,432.899,It is something we will hear about in the future but it means that a customer chooses to not just meet their load with renewable power or with green power but they are actually financially participating and encouraging development of new renewable resources.,21,,
72,0.97,432.899,438.404,They are bringing new renewable resources to the region that would not otherwise exist.,21,,
73,0.97,438.404,446.012,I think that is something that Aligns very closely with the city's climate goals and we are excited to answer any questions you might have.,21,,
74,0.97,446.012,447.246,Thank you.,22,,
75,0.97,447.246,450.716,"Colleagues, any questions?",22,,
76,0.97,450.716,451.451,Councilmember Morales?,22,,
77,0.97,451.451,453.319,Thank you.,23,,
78,0.97,453.319,457.957,Thank you for that summary.,23,,
79,0.97,457.957,462.461,This seems like a very interesting program.,23,,
80,0.97,462.461,464.664,I am really interested in how it supports workforce development.,23,,
81,0.97,464.664,511.01,"If you could talk a little bit about any work that you are doing with labor to try to retrain folks that are currently a Non-Green economy job and any Partnering that you might be doing or contemplating with local schools or training technical colleges . As we try to make this shift, it is important that we try to flush out what is concretely, what connections to building a pipeline look like and I am particularly interested to get folks from South Seattle, especially those who may not be going to college, to start building the infrastructure and the systems we need to move people into these jobs.",23,,
82,0.97,511.01,512.812,Can you talk about what that might be like?,23,,
83,0.97,512.812,513.212,Sure.,24,,
84,0.97,513.212,522.054,I can talk a little bit at a very high level and then I can commit to getting you additional information.,24,,
85,0.97,522.054,524.223,"I also would invite my colleague, Craig Smith, to jump in.",24,,
86,0.97,524.223,535.935,Workforce development and the creation of green jobs is something that--he is our chief customer officer but also something that he cares about and has done work around.,24,,
87,0.97,535.935,552.885,"In general, what is important about this particular project or this particular program, I should say, is that the jobs--certainly, we are at a Transformative point--that was interesting.",24,,
88,0.97,552.885,560.359,That was my phone.,24,,
89,0.97,560.359,561.928,Our jobs and our industry is transforming.,24,,
90,0.97,561.928,567.867,"Most of our jobs, most of the jobs in the electric utility industry are becoming greener.",24,,
91,0.97,567.867,570.67,We are becoming greener.,24,,
92,0.97,570.67,579.245,Customers want green options and they want Renewables . They want green options and they want local choice.,24,,
93,0.97,579.245,581.681,Those are critical things.,24,,
94,0.97,581.681,586.986,We are doing a lot of things to feed the pipeline.,24,,
95,0.97,586.986,608.708,"We are working closely with labor . We are developing a regional consortium that includes PSE, Tacoma, Snohomish, and city light so that we can leverage our opportunities as a region to target and bring a more diverse workforce into the new jobs that we are creating.",24,,
96,0.97,608.708,624.323,"That is work we are actively doing with the Ibew and our third-party contractor . They are a part of a national firm, actually multinational.",24,,
97,0.97,624.323,625.691,That is an exciting opportunity.,24,,
98,0.97,625.691,636.235,"Just this fall, our high- voltage apprenticeship class is being marketed to city employees.",24,,
99,0.97,636.235,645.644,One of the things we really wanted to do was to create opportunities for increased diversity but also for city employees to have income potential.,24,,
100,0.97,645.644,660.86,"By making this program available and making this class available to city employees only, we know that it will be an attractive option for many of our material Handlers, for instance.",24,,
101,0.97,660.86,663.362,That is one of the most diverse employee classifications that the city has.,24,,
102,0.97,663.362,669.035,"Again, working on that . I think you are aware, generally, we do work with Seattle college.",24,,
103,0.97,669.035,677.977,We have the basic engineering and math program that we provide and that we Fund and Ibew assists us with that.,24,,
104,0.97,677.977,690.99,That is a way we can ensure that folks who don't perhaps have the skills that they need or the math and science that they need to be successful in an apprenticeship can participate in those programs.,24,,
105,0.97,690.99,699.765,We then present them with the opportunity to compete effectively for a variety of apprenticeships . I will see if Craig or anyone has anything to offer to that.,24,,
106,0.97,699.765,731.931,"I do want to be clear that the projects that we would be funding here--what we did was we issued an Rfp and we bought some information with that . at the end of 2020--the projects that we will be potentially select thing and contracting with may not be local and I would ask Scott to share any information he can about the kinds of projects we are looking at but also, first turn to Greg.",24,,
107,0.97,731.931,734.5,"Thank you, Debra Smith.",25,,
108,0.97,734.5,760.226,"In addition to the areas cited, we have been doing a lot of work around building energy efficiency, building energy efficiency Retrofits and then also through various programs trying to Re-Increase the efficiency of buildings and new construction.",25,,
109,0.97,760.226,789.088,"That is an area were we believe there was a lot of opportunities for us creating pathways for women in Bipoc communities to really look at the demographics of existing building construction workforce, both clean energy and general building construction.",25,,
110,0.97,789.088,803.369,We identified that there are some significant gaps in terms of representation of Bipoc communities and women in the building and construction workforce.,25,,
111,0.97,803.369,824.123,"A huge opportunity to do this not only with expanded Pre- apprenticeship programs but we are also looking forward to engaging labor, to look for ways that we can move people out of the Pre-Apprenticeship programs and into the apprenticeship programs themselves.",25,,
112,0.97,824.123,847.913,"The class Makeups for certain trades, there are some pretty significant gaps . We have also done some work over the last several years with Emerald city and folks that own and operate commercial buildings, looking at the buildings operation workforce.",25,,
113,0.97,847.913,855.955,Those folks that operate and maintain systems in buildings and we have had some pretty good success.,25,,
114,0.97,855.955,863.863,We have moved the needle on the building operations workforce through various engagements to increase the number of building engineers.,25,,
115,0.97,863.863,870.069,"Still, some opportunity to grow there but I will say this.",25,,
116,0.97,870.069,874.773,Our greatest opportunities are in building construction.,25,,
117,0.97,874.773,880.479,I could speak to the program itself.,26,,
118,0.97,880.479,889.288,"'s Scott Cooper with city light, obviously.",26,,
119,0.97,889.288,890.556,I leave the design team.,26,,
120,0.97,890.556,899.865,"As Debra mentioned, we sent out the Rfp in 2020 and we got 35, 40 responses.",26,,
121,0.97,899.865,906.005,Some really strong at responses.,26,,
122,0.97,906.005,910.409,It was wind and solar located in Eastern Washington and Eastern Oregon and Montana.,26,,
123,0.97,910.409,919.585,We had the evaluation matrix and scoring criteria to Whittle that down and get the long list down to the short list we are at now.,26,,
124,0.97,919.585,924.156,One of those first criteria we were looking at was workforce development.,26,,
125,0.97,924.156,933.932,"We wanted to hear from these projects, what kind of green jobs will they be creating in the community in which they are based?",26,,
126,0.97,933.932,938.437,What community engagement are they doing with those communities they will be based in?,26,,
127,0.97,938.437,946.946,"And, other kind of partnerships that they are exploring.",26,,
128,0.97,946.946,949.815,We might be working with local community groups or school or things like that.,26,,
129,0.97,949.815,955.054,That was one of the first criteria we looked at in all of the projects we received to get into the short list.,26,,
130,0.97,955.054,965.531,That is something we Prioritized at the outset and are confident that the Shortlist projects will be good neighbors for the communities in which they are based.,26,,
131,0.97,965.531,980.279,"Thank you for those thorough responses and thank you for that question about the green jobs and moving toward a just transition . Council members, any other questions about this?",27,,
132,0.97,980.279,987.753,Otherwise we can vote to move this forward on establishing the renewable plus program.,27,,
133,0.97,987.753,993.692,All right.,27,,
134,0.97,993.692,1004.069,"Council members, I know move that the committee recommend passage of Council bill 120160, item 1 on our agenda.",27,,

172,0.97,1138.57,1139.137,Thank you.,46,,
173,0.97,1139.137,1143.408,"I am actually going to be participating in the presentation along with my colleague, Chris Townsend.",46,,
174,0.97,1143.408,1162.861,"Maura Brueger will be putting the slides up . While she works on that, I will quickly introduce the team and ask for your indulgence because I recognize that we have not yet had the opportunity to fully review on Skagit and where things are at.",46,,
175,0.97,1162.861,1166.365,"Probably much of what you know, you have watched on King 5 or read in the paper.",46,,
176,0.97,1166.365,1173.138,I want to assure you that we are actually very early in this process.,46,,
177,0.97,1173.138,1183.382,I am going to give you about a two to five minute catch you up to where we are today and then we will jump into the specific action that we are looking for.,46,,
178,0.97,1183.382,1196.595,"As you all know, our Skagit license is set to expire . Our plan, at this point, is to submit for a new license in early 2023.",46,,
179,0.97,1196.595,1206.138,"The way it works, is there are places and stages through this process.",46,,
180,0.97,1206.138,1214.046,The very first thing that we have worked to negotiate with our partners--we refer to and you will see Referenced to the notion of licensed participants.,46,,
181,0.97,1214.046,1220.385,Licensed participants are a fairly large group.,46,,
182,0.97,1220.385,1222.888,"Chris, how many licensed participants do we have in that category?",46,,
183,0.97,1222.888,1230.295,"There have been over the 30 that have participated such as Nonprofits, local government.",47,,
184,0.97,1230.295,1243.041,"Chris Townsend, by the way, is our director of city licensing . He is--this is his first licensing he is negotiating.",48,,
185,0.97,1243.041,1248.614,"I also have with me today, in addition to Maura Brueger, Mike Haynes who is city light's chief environmental and generation officer.",48,,
186,0.97,1248.614,1255.12,Mike is overseeing the licensing working with Chris and our team.,48,,
187,0.97,1255.12,1263.061,The first piece that happens is we engage with the license participants about what science and what information folks need to make decisions.,48,,
188,0.97,1263.061,1276.975,"That all culminates in us submitting--which we did in May, a final plan to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.",48,,
189,0.97,1276.975,1288.687,They issue licenses for Nonfederal projects . It is kind of confusing because we talk about Ferk as the Federal entity.,48,,
190,0.97,1288.687,1290.856,"Federal projects are for instance, the Columbia River system.",48,,
191,0.97,1290.856,1301.266,We call that the Federal Columbia River power systems which consists of all the dams on the Columbia River and the lower snake River.,48,,
192,0.97,1301.266,1310.175,Those dams produce the power that is marketed by Bonneville in the region and we purchased a block of power from Bonneville which largely comes from those systems.,48,,
193,0.97,1310.175,1318.517,"In addition, as you know--I'm just giving you a little bit of background and context.",48,,
194,0.97,1318.517,1320.318,City light has several of our own generation projects.,48,,
195,0.97,1320.318,1329.828,We have the project at boundary and we have the project at Skagit . We call them projects because they really work.,48,,
196,0.97,1329.828,1330.696,They are very different.,48,,
197,0.97,1330.696,1335.934,Skagit and boundary are very different types of projects.,48,,
198,0.97,1335.934,1336.935,Boundary is a river project.,48,,
199,0.97,1336.935,1343.442,"We don't have the ability to hold water, for instance.",48,,
200,0.97,1343.442,1354.353,"At the Skagit, we have three Powerhouses and three dams and we have the ability to hold water . When we talk about water in a Hydro system, water is the fuel.",48,,
201,0.97,1354.353,1373.872,"Our ability to store fuel and water is what allows us to generate more power during the times when Seattle needs more power and then hold water during the times when we don't so that it is available for when we do need it . that is a very, very high-level notion of how the systems work.",48,,
202,0.97,1373.872,1378.543,The three dams on the Skagit do all work together.,48,,
203,0.97,1378.543,1379.845,They were designed to work together.,48,,
204,0.97,1379.845,1394.393,"It has to do with both how the generating system that the city installs, how that works, but also the geography of the three dams along the way.",48,,
205,0.97,1394.393,1395.394,That all works together.,48,,
206,0.97,1395.394,1403.301,The reason that is important is because you have heard--there have been some calls around removing gorge dam.,48,,
207,0.97,1403.301,1414.913,Gorge dam is what provides a great deal of the flexibility and the flood control that are critical to this project and critical to this system.,48,,
208,0.97,1414.913,1421.553,It is not as simple as Unhooking one piece from a system and I just needed to explain that very quickly up front.,48,,
209,0.97,1421.553,1439.905,As we have been in these negotiations around what would go in the final study plan and what science we would conduct over a two-year period and that is the Timeline we are still operating under.,48,,
210,0.97,1439.905,1452.918,"It is science this summer, science next summer and then we would begin to negotiate the actual terms of the license request to Ferk and ultimately Ferk will tell us what we need to implement.",48,,
211,0.97,1452.918,1456.755,"As we were doing that, you heard that our relationship with the tribes thought rocky for a bit.",48,,
212,0.97,1456.755,1459.157,I am here to tell you that things are much better now.,48,,
213,0.97,1459.157,1464.863,There are two pieces of pending litigation.,48,,
214,0.97,1464.863,1466.097,I don't want to gloss that over.,48,,
215,0.97,1466.097,1484.783,"One is a Pdr suit from Skagit County . We are continuing to work through that and you should know that the city attorney's office believes we have, in fact--the Pdr's that the complaint was filed over are still open and we are still working to gather information that is responsive to that.",48,,
216,0.97,1484.783,1486.384,We are working hard on that front.,48,,
217,0.97,1486.384,1495.56,There was also a piece of litigation filed by one of the three primary tribes and that piece was around removal of gorge dam.,48,,
218,0.97,1495.56,1497.395,That is playing itself out.,48,,
219,0.97,1497.395,1506.071,"Our relationship with them, we have worked hard to reset the relationships.",48,,
220,0.97,1506.071,1517.482,"We brought in New legal Council, a local farm, Cascadia law which includes help from Jay Manning, people here who most folks know.",48,,
221,0.97,1517.482,1518.517,The tribes are familiar with.,48,,
222,0.97,1518.517,1532.53,"As a result of a lot of changes and soul-searching we found, in terms of how we communicate and how we make commitments and follow-up on those, we are feeling pretty positive for where we are right now in the process.",48,,
223,0.97,1532.53,1538.236,Let's go to the next slide.,48,,
224,0.97,1538.236,1550.215,What we are asking for today is--it is an ordinance that establishes this habitat Enhancement program and funding levels.,48,,
225,0.97,1550.215,1551.383,It relies on existing appropriations.,48,,
226,0.97,1551.383,1552.45,We are not asking for money.,48,,
227,0.97,1552.45,1561.359,What we are asking for his authority for me to sign agreements as we make awards from within this spot.,48,,
228,0.97,1561.359,1563.428,There was no impact to rates.,48,,
229,0.97,1563.428,1573.972,"The funds are part of the overall budget for the Skagit budget . again, you approve as part of our overall CIP and budget that we bring forward.",48,,
230,0.97,1573.972,1583.281,The other thing that this does is it creates a partnership opportunity for the tribes and agencies.,48,,
231,0.97,1583.281,1585.55,I know you are aware that we have a review panel.,48,,
232,0.97,1585.55,1588.086,You have heard from them recently on operational planning.,48,,
233,0.97,1588.086,1596.294,We kind of think of this as a smaller version of the review panel as well.,48,,
234,0.97,1596.294,1597.896,"Or, at least a more narrowly focused review panel.",48,,
235,0.97,1597.896,1607.339,The idea here is that we would create this Fund and then we would use monies from the fund to do projects and to supplement projects.,48,,
236,0.97,1607.339,1609.107,Rarely would we be out there on our own.,48,,
237,0.97,1609.107,1625.79,We would largely be working as a partner with other work . It would largely be focused on the estuaries and the area below where the Sauk River INTERSECTS the Skagit.,48,,
238,0.97,1625.79,1636.735,"For us, in Relicensing, there is this concept about the area of impact . We are responsible for and work hard to mitigate our impacts within that area.",48,,
239,0.97,1636.735,1644.142,It is very hard to clearly identify impacts from our project on the Estuary below the Sauk.,48,,
240,0.97,1644.142,1657.455,We recognize that the Skagit is an incredibly important source for salmon and for our community and the Watershd and the valley.,48,,
241,0.97,1657.455,1668.633,"By making this funding source available and working directly with license participants and partners to award farms, allows us to participate in habitat Enhancement.",48,,
242,0.97,1668.633,1679.444,One of the things that we really focused on is saying that we are interested in an Ecosystem wide approach to this Relicensing.,48,,
243,0.97,1679.444,1680.178,We are looking at fish.,48,,
244,0.97,1680.178,1681.246,We are looking at habitat.,48,,
245,0.97,1681.246,1682.28,We are looking at people.,48,,
246,0.97,1682.28,1691.589,We are really trying to take the broadest view . Let's go to the next slide.,48,,
247,0.97,1691.589,1693.458,I started talking a bit about the process.,49,,
248,0.97,1693.458,1706.404,"This is a very skinny and down version of a slide that you may see another time as we move through our process but the notion is, we learn, we plan, we do and then we are constantly evaluating.",49,,
249,0.97,1706.404,1710.475,"Right now, we are in the study phase.",49,,
250,0.97,1710.475,1719.818,For how many folks are out there working at any point in time right now?,49,,
251,0.97,1719.818,1722.887,We have 30 or 40 people out in the field at any given time.,50,,
252,0.97,1722.887,1726.324,We have hired almost every single consulting firm in the region.,50,,
253,0.97,1726.324,1727.726,It is a very big effort.,51,,
254,0.97,1727.726,1729.994,We have tons of scientists working on the river.,51,,
255,0.97,1729.994,1734.099,They will be working and taking the data that they accumulate.,51,,
256,0.97,1734.099,1739.37,"Again, the science we are doing is also in conduction with the license participants.",51,,
257,0.97,1739.37,1747.846,They are helping us in the studies and it will help us evaluate the data.,51,,
258,0.97,1747.846,1755.353,There is very little point in Údoing any of this if we are no doing it in collaboration and partnership with the folks who are vested in the river.,51,,
259,0.97,1755.353,1761.659,"At the end of the day, all of this data will be used to develop a license application that hopefully they can all support.",51,,
260,0.97,1761.659,1764.529,We welcome them and we work closely with them.,51,,
261,0.97,1764.529,1770.168,Our final study plan determination came out July 16.,51,,
262,0.97,1770.168,1775.073,Did when we submitted the final study plan to Ferk was we made a few commitments.,51,,
263,0.97,1775.073,1778.943,We committed to do some early action items.,51,,
264,0.97,1778.943,1786.651,"I will stop right here . Once we have the science, then we will plan.",51,,
265,0.97,1786.651,1788.987,We will implement early commitments including this habitat Enhancement program.,51,,
266,0.97,1788.987,1803.501,"That means that as we learn, as we complete studies and we gain knowledge, if there are things that we know we can do, we won't necessarily wait for the license.",51,,
267,0.97,1803.501,1811.409,Ferk does allow you to do early action items and then to take credit for those early action items within the license implementation.,51,,
268,0.97,1811.409,1821.719,"Again, there is no sense in waiting if you have information then, we will implement the requirements of the new license.",51,,
269,0.97,1821.719,1826.024,We will submit the application in April 2023.,51,,
270,0.97,1826.024,1830.728,It generally will take a couple of years and there will be a process during that time.,51,,
271,0.97,1830.728,1835.733,Ferk will do a lot to review and hopefully have a new license by April 2025.,51,,
272,0.97,1835.733,1840.505,"Then, to evaluate, that is the ongoing Adaptive management.",51,,
273,0.97,1840.505,1846.211,He River system is a living system.,51,,
274,0.97,1846.211,1847.011,It is constantly changing.,51,,
275,0.97,1847.011,1853.451,We all know that . climate change and other impacts are constantly causing things to behave in different ways.,51,,
276,0.97,1853.451,1859.357,Adaptive management is incredibly important.,51,,
277,0.97,1859.357,1865.263,"As we learn and as things change, we will modify and change our approach along the way and that is a critical piece of the license.",51,,
278,0.97,1865.263,1867.966,Now let's go to the next slide.,51,,
279,0.97,1867.966,1886.384,The Pre-License commitments that we are talking to you about today and that we made to the tribes and to the license participants in the form of a letter that they received at the time when we filed our final study plan with FERC had largely three components.,52,,
280,0.97,1886.384,1890.888,One is to retort flows to the gorge reach of the river.,52,,
281,0.97,1890.888,1901.199,You see two pictures on the screen and the left picture is how that reach typically looks.,52,,
282,0.97,1901.199,1904.669,"When I say and when we say restore water, we spill.",52,,
283,0.97,1904.669,1913.811,"There are times when there is water in that reach and the picture over on the right--Chris, could you tell your story about this picture?",52,,
284,0.97,1913.811,1914.812,It is kind of cool.,52,,
285,0.97,1914.812,1923.388,"The picture on the right, I happened to be up at a meeting at the environmental learning center on the hottest day of the year, January whatever that was.",53,,
286,0.97,1923.388,1924.989,It was 109.,53,,
287,0.97,1924.989,1926.591,June 30.,54,,
288,0.97,1926.591,1928.426,Sorry.,55,,
289,0.97,1928.426,1934.032,It was the hottest day of the year and it was about 109 at the project.,55,,
290,0.97,1934.032,1942.04,It was really unusual for the project to spill in summer.,55,,
291,0.97,1942.04,1955.453,"That is when we are really conserving water, generating electricity with whatever water we have . Since it was so hot, every single air-conditioner in the Seattle was on . The glaciers were melting faster than they normally do which is kind of scary.",55,,
292,0.97,1955.453,1957.422,We had an Overabundance of water.,55,,
293,0.97,1957.422,1965.63,"We were spilling at Diablo, which I was on top of.",55,,
294,0.97,1965.63,1971.069,Then I drove down to see what it looked like at gorge . This is a 2700 CFS flow which is Overtop of banks.,55,,
295,0.97,1971.069,1982.08,"This is more full than the river whatever be expected to be . The participants are asking us to put a flow in for aesthetic and recreational, potentially for fish habitat.",55,,
296,0.97,1982.08,1993.858,It will be somewhat lower than what you see on the right but it is an unusual opportunity to see what this looks like and maybe conditions could be more Frquent with climate change in the future.,55,,
297,0.97,1993.858,1997.695,We hope not but that could be what the future brings.,55,,
298,0.97,1997.695,2013.711,"What spill means, in case there is anyone who does not know, spill means when we divert water around . You got so much water coming down the river that we can't run it all to the driven so we spill it around the powerhouse.",56,,
299,0.97,2013.711,2019.417,That is generally what spill means.,56,,
300,0.97,2019.417,2041.139,"As you can see just from looking at these two pictures, this is an incredibly important early action item, particularly to the upper Skagit Indian tribe . This is in their backyard and they experience the picture on the left . seeing it in real life, they experience it as a piece of cultural trauma.",56,,
301,0.97,2041.139,2047.445,We expected that FERC would ask us to Re-Water that reach so we have made a commitment to move forward with it.,56,,
302,0.97,2047.445,2059.056,We are working with the Deq and other agencies as well as the tribes to figure out how we can best Imbue that in a controlled and appropriate way.,56,,
303,0.97,2059.056,2060.057,That is happening right now.,56,,
304,0.97,2060.057,2064.529,We are not sure how long it will take but we certainly hope that reach will be Re-Watered within two years.,56,,
305,0.97,2064.529,2080.978,"We already talked about the habitat Enhancement program which is particularly focused Downriver in the Estuary . As I mentioned, we would also implement critical early actions prior to issuance of the licensing.",56,,
306,0.97,2080.978,2088.352,"When we were talking through this program and talking with Councilmember Strauss, he asked, are there examples?",56,,
307,0.97,2088.352,2092.39,We really don't have them yet.,56,,
308,0.97,2092.39,2099.13,These are things we will learn as we participate and do the science.,56,,
309,0.97,2099.13,2103.167,"To the extent that things come up that we can go ahead and move forward with, we will.",56,,
310,0.97,2103.167,2106.37,Next slide.,56,,
311,0.97,2106.37,2112.477,"The habitat program, the idea here is a fund for habitat Enhancement work.",57,,
312,0.97,2112.477,2124.889,"We would initially fund it at the $2.5 million level and then we would add an additional $500,000 each year prior to the new license.",57,,
313,0.97,2124.889,2153.351,"Each year that we are in the negotiation process, we would include in our budget an additional 500,000. as we are making awards from the funds, we are keeping it at a somewhat consistent level . We would hope to initially hear and announce the fund by the city along with an initial award that we expect to be in the $500,000 range.",57,,
314,0.97,2153.351,2157.622,Taking this action now demonstrates our commitment to salmon recovery during the process.,57,,
315,0.97,2157.622,2161.259,It also really demonstrates our commitment to doing what we say we will do.,57,,
316,0.97,2161.259,2175.273,"We issued this letter back in May and it is important for our partners, all of our partners, to see us moving forward, to take action as soon as we can.",57,,
317,0.97,2175.273,2204.502,"It will bridge the Ecosystem investment between the old license and the new . It is an opportunity--prior to negotiating the terms of the license, for us to work together with our partners in a constructive way . As we are talking about and making decisions about project that we could fund here, we will practice and have some memory muscle on how we make those decisions in a collaborative, respectful way, going forward which will be super important when we are negotiating the terms of the license.",57,,
318,0.97,2204.502,2205.97,Next slide.,57,,
319,0.97,2205.97,2206.37,Questions?,58,,
320,0.97,2206.37,2207.972,That was a lot.,58,,
321,0.97,2207.972,2212.076,"Thank you, general manager Smith.",59,,
322,0.97,2212.076,2229.527,I know we will have some questions here . Thank you for providing the broader context and for pointing out that it is in 2023. it is in a couple of years when we will be Reengaged in this more thoroughly.,59,,
323,0.97,2229.527,2231.095,I appreciate you providing the full context.,59,,
324,0.97,2231.095,2248.946,"Just to clarify for everybody, all we are being asked to do right now is to approve a $2.5 million habitat Enhancement program that city light has promised as part of early steps in this process.",59,,
325,0.97,2248.946,2252.85,We are not endorsing anything larger than that.,59,,
326,0.97,2252.85,2261.826,We are not signing on to any sort of process or what has happened thus far.,59,,
327,0.97,2261.826,2263.861,It is simply a $2.5 million program from existing funds.,59,,
328,0.97,2263.861,2264.462,Is that correct?,59,,
329,0.97,2264.462,2266.063,That is absolutely correct.,60,,
330,0.97,2266.063,2269.166,Councilmember Herbold?,61,,
331,0.97,2269.166,2269.767,Thank you.,62,,
332,0.97,2269.767,2285.182,"You may have covered this but I heard you say that as you were announcing the Fund, you also will announce the $500,000 award . I am struggling a little bit with how that is possible?",62,,
333,0.97,2285.182,2289.453,"I'm imagining with the funds, people have a chance to apply.",62,,
334,0.97,2289.453,2303.668,"Are you saying that absent the opportunity to apply to the Fund, the utility is going to choose a project some other way?",62,,
335,0.97,2303.668,2310.975,"Is the $500,000 initial project?",62,,
336,0.97,2310.975,2312.677,"Thank you for the question, Councilmember.",63,,
337,0.97,2312.677,2313.611,"Chris, can you take that one?",63,,
338,0.97,2313.611,2323.788,We are getting late into 2021 . It is not going to be possible to form the committee that will be making the consensus decisions about the investments we will be making.,64,,
339,0.97,2323.788,2330.628,We thought it was important to get some money on the ground early.,64,,
340,0.97,2330.628,2335.933,We have been coordinating with the three tribes and they are very interested in that and they have a couple of projects in the Estuary in mind.,64,,
341,0.97,2335.933,2343.541,It will still be a Collaboratively selected fund but just not under the full committee that we will be using to distribute the rest of the funding.,64,,
342,0.97,2343.541,2344.108,Thank you.,65,,
343,0.97,2344.108,2346.711,That is very helpful.,65,,
344,0.97,2346.711,2358.723,"As far as eligible activities that will be possible under this Fund, is Lane acquisition an eligible equity?",65,,
345,0.97,2358.723,2362.56,"It would be, yes.",66,,
346,0.97,2362.56,2376.173,The license participants are interested in it being as broadly interpreted as possible so that we can deal with the priorities in the watershed.,66,,
347,0.97,2376.173,2377.375,Thank you so much.,67,,
348,0.97,2377.375,2379.243,"You raise a really good point, Councilmember Herbold.",68,,
349,0.97,2379.243,2389.186,"One thing I did not say is, in many ways, this is modeled after a habitat program that was under the prior license that you have seen regularly.",68,,
350,0.97,2389.186,2399.964,"Recently, we brought forward ratification opportunity for you around Skagit Valley property purchases.",68,,
351,0.97,2399.964,2400.765,The location is different.,68,,
352,0.97,2400.765,2401.999,That was more in the valley.,68,,
353,0.97,2401.999,2404.001,This is more in the Estuary.,68,,
354,0.97,2404.001,2407.671,We do have experience with this type of program.,68,,
355,0.97,2407.671,2414.178,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",69,,
356,0.97,2414.178,2422.953,"General manager Smith, I know that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is the key entity in charge of this process.",69,,
357,0.97,2422.953,2437.568,"However, before the 2023 submission, I think we would like you to come back and give us some more information as you get closer to that key moment of submitting the application.",69,,
358,0.97,2437.568,2438.135,Absolutely.,70,,
359,0.97,2438.135,2464.461,"We are going to want to, and carve out some good chunks of time . When we submit that license, it will have significant impacts for the city in terms of our power rates . We, at this point, don't know whether we will be able to generate--right now, we don't know anything except that having a strong collaborative relationship with our partners is really important.",70,,
360,0.97,2464.461,2478.342,"And, we also will ask if we can take some of you up there to take a look at things . If you have not had a chance to go up there, that will be important.",70,,
361,0.97,2478.342,2480.578,There will be lots of engagement.,70,,
362,0.97,2480.578,2481.178,Thank you.,71,,
363,0.97,2481.178,2493.39,"Council members, any other questions about this habitat Enhancement program for the $2.5 million of existing funds?",71,,
364,0.97,2493.39,2500.698,"I just wanted to check again with our central staff analyst, Eric Mcconaghy, if he wanted to say anything about this at this time.",71,,
365,0.97,2500.698,2501.966,No thank you.,72,,
366,0.97,2501.966,2508.372,Just anything about any land acquisitions that happen.,72,,
367,0.97,2508.372,2512.676,Those deed acceptances have to be finalized with Council action.,72,,
368,0.97,2512.676,2518.582,That would be another step of the process.,72,,
369,0.97,2518.582,2522.653,This committee has seen those in the committee and the Council has seen those even this year.,72,,
370,0.97,2522.653,2523.687,That has happened at Skagit.,72,,
371,0.97,2523.687,2525.89,That is part of a city light has been doing there.,72,,
372,0.97,2525.89,2531.395,Any land acquisition would have to be approved by Council through a formal act.,72,,
373,0.97,2531.395,2535.432,"Mike, do you have anything you want to throw in?",73,,
374,0.97,2535.432,2539.303,Are we good from your perspective?,73,,
375,0.97,2539.303,2544.541,"Thank you, Debra, I am good.",74,,

402,0.97,2621.318,2647.678,We appreciate it and we can't wait to continue the education . It really is an incredible opportunity for the city to engage with our communities to be responsive and--the way I think of it is there is just a lot of opportunity to work closely together for the benefit of all.,90,,
403,0.97,2647.678,2648.846,Thank you very much.,90,,
404,0.97,2648.846,2651.415,Appreciate it.,90,,
405,0.97,2651.415,2652.016,Thank you.,91,,

408,0.97,2655.319,2661.959,The motion carries in the committee recommendation of the bill passed will be sent to the September 20 city council meeting.,92,,
409,0.97,2661.959,2670.067,Will the clerk please read the short title of the next agenda item into the record?,92,,
410,0.97,2670.067,2679.643,"Agenda item 3, council 120161, an ordinance relating to Seattle public utilities, updating water regulations to conform to current standards for breathing, discussion, and possible vote.",93,,
411,0.97,2679.643,2681.979,Thank you.,94,,
412,0.97,2681.979,2695.693,"This bill AMENDS the section of the Seattle municipal code concerning broken, difficult to read water meters owned by Seattle public utilities.",94,,
413,0.97,2695.693,2699.163,Clarifies how Seattle public utilities repairs an estimated charge until the meter can be read.,94,,
414,0.97,2699.163,2722.519,"As I understand it, this does not change the utility's overall practices . We will hear more from Seattle public utilities on this . before we turn it over, I wanted to check in with our central staff analyst Brian goodnight to see if he had any introductory remarks on this.",94,,
415,0.97,2722.519,2725.122,"Thank you, chair Pedersen.",95,,
416,0.97,2725.122,2726.356,Nothing in addition to what you said.,95,,
417,0.97,2726.356,2730.26,It is a fairly simple bill and I am happy to turn it over to Spu for their presentation.,95,,
418,0.97,2730.26,2731.428,Thank you.,96,,
419,0.97,2731.428,2736.733,I see we have deputy director Lee here.,96,,
420,0.97,2736.733,2738.335,Did you want to lead it off?,96,,
421,0.97,2738.335,2738.569,Yes.,97,,
422,0.97,2738.569,2746.844,"Good morning committee chair Pedersen and Council members Morales, Herbold, Gonzalez and Strauss.",97,,
423,0.97,2746.844,2756.42,I am pinch hitting this morning for Mami Hara who was unable to join us this morning.,97,,
424,0.97,2756.42,2772.202,Thank you for considering this legislation to update the city code . The Seattle municipal code describes on Spu bills and how estimated bills are calculated.,97,,
425,0.97,2772.202,2774.838,"On average, less than 3% of our bills are based on estimated reads.",97,,
426,0.97,2774.838,2775.973,It is very much a minority.,97,,
427,0.97,2775.973,2785.282,"Minor updates to the code, however, are needed to accurately describe Spu's current business practices and to clarify how estimated bills are calculated.",97,,
428,0.97,2785.282,2791.588,"We are proposing this morning, additional minor and Nonsubstantive revisions to make the code more readable.",97,,
429,0.97,2791.588,2802.299,I would like to introduce Dan ward who is Spu's lead for this update and he will walk the committee to the proposed code modifications.,97,,
430,0.97,2802.299,2809.773,Good morning.,98,,
431,0.97,2809.773,2814.111,Hopefully you are able to see the slide deck now.,98,,
432,0.97,2814.111,2816.713,Good morning and thank you for the opportunity to be here.,98,,
433,0.97,2816.713,2818.115,I will jump right in.,98,,
434,0.97,2818.115,2825.088,This is minor changes to this.,98,,
435,0.97,2825.088,2832.396,The proposed changes are primarily about estimated reads and how the utility calculates estimated bills.,98,,
436,0.97,2832.396,2843.073,I will provide just a quick background on estimated billing and walk you through the proposed changes and then we will be happy to answer any questions.,98,,
437,0.97,2843.073,2847.911,I will start with a simple background on how we bill customers.,98,,
438,0.97,2847.911,2863.46,"Spu relies, in most cases on meter readers going out and walking a route or driving a route and they will in most cases lift a lid and obtain a visual read at the water meter.",98,,
439,0.97,2863.46,2867.364,That read will then be used to bill the customer for both water and wastewater.,98,,
440,0.97,2867.364,2869.366,It is very accurate.,98,,
441,0.97,2869.366,2879.376,It is a good way of doing things . We are generally very good about getting actual reads for almost all of our customers every billing period.,98,,
442,0.97,2879.376,2887.251,"As Andrew mentioned, it is between 1% and 3% that our bills are estimated.",98,,
443,0.97,2887.251,2894.992,We are here today to talk about some proposed changes to capture that scenario when we have a bill based on estimates.,98,,
444,0.97,2894.992,2901.465,"Although it is not a huge percentage, it is still an issue for us.",98,,
445,0.97,2901.465,2908.171,"Just to talk through some of the different scenarios, we make every effort to get an actual read.",98,,
446,0.97,2908.171,2910.707,"Sometimes, there are things that prevent us from doing that.",98,,
447,0.97,2910.707,2913.277,I will give you a few concrete examples and we will highlight them.,98,,
448,0.97,2913.277,2925.622,"If there is snow or ice, there may be scenarios where it is difficult or dangerous for a meter reader to go out and walk up a steep Hill and lift a lid.",98,,
449,0.97,2925.622,2933.263,"If there is inclement weather, there are times or we can't get an actual reading and that is when we could give a bill based on an estimate.",98,,
450,0.97,2933.263,2943.307,Another example is cars parked over meter lids.,98,,
451,0.97,2943.307,2949.212,"In many parts of the city, especially where there are no sidewalks, it is perfectly legal for cars to park in areas where there might be over a lid.",98,,
452,0.97,2949.212,2956.954,"The problem with that is that if a meter reader is out there walking around, they're not going to be able to get access to the meter and get an actual read that they can use for billing.",98,,
453,0.97,2956.954,2961.758,Another big category is construction.,98,,
454,0.97,2961.758,2964.861,We have a big site that is Underdevelopment and there might be fencing up.,98,,
455,0.97,2964.861,2971.034,"Similarly, our meter readers won't be able to get access to that meter . It will be obstructed.",98,,
456,0.97,2971.034,2972.636,That is another scenario that has happen.,98,,
457,0.97,2972.636,2975.572,Just to jump through the minor changes.,98,,
458,0.97,2975.572,2984.748,"Right now, the SMC says that Spu will bill customers based on estimates if the meter fails to register properly.",98,,
459,0.97,2984.748,2986.616,"In other words, if the meter is broken.",98,,
460,0.97,2986.616,2997.961,The proposed changes are touching on that other scenario where we are not able to get a meter read . that is a pretty minor change.,98,,
461,0.97,2997.961,3002.399,It is something we are already doing and it is just a reality.,98,,
462,0.97,3002.399,3006.103,There are occasions where we can't get the actual read.,98,,
463,0.97,3006.103,3011.174,The other change is on how we calculate estimated goals.,98,,
464,0.97,3011.174,3020.484,"Right now, the SMC has language and there about using prior months when we have good reads to Billy customer.",98,,
465,0.97,3020.484,3023.053,The proposed changes actually touch on using historical water consumption.,98,,
466,0.97,3023.053,3029.426,"That is a really good metric, generally, for a customer's actual usage.",98,,
467,0.97,3029.426,3045.242,"For example, if you have a customer's consumption from July from the year prior for July of this year, it is generally pretty good . It is something that we would use as our primary method.",98,,
468,0.97,3045.242,3050.547,We added in some language to allow for some flexibility for other weird situations.,98,,
469,0.97,3050.547,3055.318,"One example of that would be, we put [Indiscernible] consumption as a method.",98,,
470,0.97,3055.318,3061.992,That refers to--imagine a customer has a water [Indiscernible] and their consumption jumps way up.,98,,
471,0.97,3061.992,3074.738,That will not be a good period to use for estimated billing in the future because it is a billing where there consumption was artificially much higher than normal.,98,,
472,0.97,3074.738,3079.376,That is something we want to be able to address.,98,,
473,0.97,3079.376,3081.645,The other is having this flexibility to use other reliable data.,98,,
474,0.97,3081.645,3084.081,A great example there is Covid.,98,,
475,0.97,3084.081,3089.352,"During Covid, a lot of businesses were shut down or were running at less than full operation.",98,,
476,0.97,3089.352,3110.874,You can imagine the consumption during that period for some of these customers will be much lower . You would not want to bill that customer for their historical water usage from the year prior when they were using a lot of water if they were shut down during the relevant time period.,98,,
477,0.97,3110.874,3122.219,"Again, we want to have this flexibility where we can bill a customer as accurately as possible and get it as close as we can when we issue the estimated bill.",98,,
478,0.97,3122.219,3131.795,"I guess the last point on this is that when we do estimated billing, in most cases, we are able to get an actual read.",98,,
479,0.97,3131.795,3145.008,"If there is a difference between the estimated bill and the customer's actual consumption, they will eventually get a corrected bill that will be up or down a little bit.",98,,
480,0.97,3145.008,3154.951,"It will be fixed but we want to get it right when that estimated bill goes out, if we can because then it is less of an impact to the customer when they get their final bill.",98,,
481,0.97,3154.951,3158.855,Those are the two issues we are proposing changes.,98,,
482,0.97,3158.855,3168.365,The only other issue is Non- substantive changes to add in some references to some other relevant SMC.,98,,
483,0.97,3168.365,3178.175,"If someone is reading this, they will know where to find other SMC the can be helpful to understand other relevant issues.",98,,
484,0.97,3178.175,3179.743,That is all I have for today.,98,,
485,0.97,3179.743,3181.578,"Thank you again, happy to answer any questions as well.",98,,
486,0.97,3181.578,3184.381,Thank you very much.,99,,
487,0.97,3184.381,3192.355,"Council members, any questions for Seattle public utilities about these changes to the water meter reading rules?",99,,
488,0.97,3192.355,3193.223,Great.,99,,
489,0.97,3193.223,3204.467,All right . We appreciate you coming here with this presentation.,99,,
490,0.97,3204.467,3210.206,We know Spu has another presentation right after this so we will go ahead and move forward with this bill here.,99,,
491,0.97,3210.206,3220.984,"Council members, if there are no questions on this water meter reading bill, I will go ahead and move that the committee recommend passage of Council bill 120161, item 3 on our agenda.",99,,
492,0.97,3220.984,3224.421,Is there a second?,99,,

506,0.97,3249.746,3256.72,Yes.,110,,
507,0.97,3256.72,3257.954,"Five in favor, none opposed.",111,,
508,0.97,3257.954,3259.255,"Thank you, the motion carries.",112,,
509,0.97,3259.255,3264.461,The committee recommendation of the bill passed will be sent to the September 20 city council meeting.,112,,
510,0.97,3264.461,3266.062,"Thank you, everybody who presented on that one.",112,,
511,0.97,3266.062,3270.533,Will the clerk please read the title of the next agenda item into the record?,112,,
512,0.97,3270.533,3293.69,"Agenda item 4, council bill 120175, an ordinance authorizing Seattle public utilities to execute agreements under Rcw 70A.140.040 for projects and programs that prevent water pollution using green Stormwater infrastructure and other nature based approaches.",113,,
513,0.97,3293.69,3294.791,"For briefing, discussion, and possible vote.",113,,
514,0.97,3294.791,3295.291,Thank you.,114,,
515,0.97,3295.291,3311.574,"Colleagues, as I understand, this bill implement a mechanism to improve water quality policies that were initially called for and authorized by the state Legislature and confirmed I the city council.",114,,
516,0.97,3311.574,3326.189,These green Stormwater infrastructure policies are carried forward into Seattle public utilities strategic business plan that we had approved . The bill authorizes Spu to enter into Performance- based contracts for handling Stormwater as the Presenters will explain.,114,,
517,0.97,3326.189,3347.944,"As we know, by encouraging green Stormwater infrastructure, we can provide another tool for managing our city's Stormwater runoff to prevent pollution of our waterways . Our City Council central staff to distributed a memo this past Friday . The memo is on our committee agenda.",114,,
518,0.97,3347.944,3351.381,I wanted to give our central Stefanski opportunity if they wanted to help set the table here.,114,,
519,0.97,3351.381,3353.817,"Otherwise, we will turn it over to Spu to discuss the bill.",114,,
520,0.97,3353.817,3367.43,"I will briefly mention that I am sure Spu will cover it but really, the function of this bill is to delegate authority from what is authorized in state law for the city Council to perform some functions . It is delegating that authority down to Spu.",115,,
521,0.97,3367.43,3369.466,I just wanted to make that clear at the beginning.,115,,
522,0.97,3369.466,3370.066,Thank you.,115,,
523,0.97,3370.066,3370.934,Thank you.,116,,
524,0.97,3370.934,3372.736,Okay.,116,,
525,0.97,3372.736,3379.642,"Welcome back, Spu . Deputy director Lee, if you want to get it started?",116,,
526,0.97,3379.642,3380.076,Absolutely.,117,,
527,0.97,3380.076,3395.792,Brian stated that this is really about authorizing Spu to have the authority to do an accelerated project delivery or contracting mechanism to implement our environmental programs related to green Stormwater infrastructure.,117,,
528,0.97,3395.792,3402.365,. those are about decreasing runoff into our water bodies.,117,,
529,0.97,3402.365,3413.109,I am particularly excited about this because we view utilities' work as a platform for greater social good.,117,,
530,0.97,3413.109,3428.124,"One of the amazing things about this mechanism as it enables us to partner with Community-Based organizations to realize additional benefits beyond just water quality and ecological benefits . Some of those things include things like job creation, particularly in Bipoc communities.",117,,
531,0.97,3428.124,3433.83,We achieve that through this Community-Based partnership with organizations that specialize in network.,117,,
532,0.97,3433.83,3441.871,"As was mentioned, our current contract Toolkit does not include this unique contracting mechanism.",117,,
533,0.97,3441.871,3457.62,"It is allowed by the state of Washington but this piece of legislation would authorize us to be able to use it . at this point, I would like to hand things off to Tracy Tackett to provide any more details.",117,,
534,0.97,3457.62,3460.19,We also have Pam Emerson to provide more details.,117,,
535,0.97,3460.19,3463.726,Good morning and thank you for your time this morning.,118,,
536,0.97,3463.726,3477.073,"A little bit on jargon to make sure everyone is familiar with green Stormwater infrastructure . at its core, it is the use of natural systems as we solve our drainage and wastewater problems.",118,,
537,0.97,3477.073,3496.392,"That includes things like Floatable Open-Space, fire retention, Floodplains, engineering approaches that help make hard surfaces act more like natural surfaces and things that use natural based systems like Rainwater harvesting.",118,,
538,0.97,3496.392,3513.076,Several folks have already Teed up with this but it is an ordinance around delegating authority from city Council to Seattle public utilities so that we can do this contract livery mechanism.,118,,
539,0.97,3513.076,3518.982,We are excited about this contract livery mechanism using Performance-Based contracting.,118,,
540,0.97,3518.982,3543.106,"Specifically, the type of Performance-Based contracting we are looking at for the Stormwater mechanism is called a Community-Based public Rivet partnership . what it is about is working Programmatically with the type of partners that we are interested in for this set of tools and a disputed passion.",118,,
541,0.97,3543.106,3555.151,"Instead of working one project at a time, we can contract out for a larger set of solutions at one time.",118,,
542,0.97,3555.151,3565.061,"We set up the criteria as well as our community priorities and our community benefit goals, which I will talk about in just a second.",118,,
543,0.97,3565.061,3579.475,"By doing this contract mechanism, it would be able to have us save some costs through transferring risk . This Partnering mechanism is better set up for working on the one- On-One parcel owner.",118,,
544,0.97,3579.475,3592.889,"If some projects don't come to fruition are ones that Spu will not pay for, it moves on to the contracting primed to work the details to find the right solution.",118,,
545,0.97,3592.889,3596.559,"As a whole, there will be a lower set of soft costs on our part in working through this.",118,,
546,0.97,3596.559,3611.574,What it also offers is this deep ability to work with our community partners for identifying project sites and implementing projects and really supporting the Resourcing to help develop those elements.,118,,
547,0.97,3611.574,3620.717,"From the community benefits side, on a programmatic feel, we are able to set performance criteria of what needs to be embedded in the contract.",118,,
548,0.97,3620.717,3625.188,One of the workforce goals are key to us.,118,,
549,0.97,3625.188,3649.746,We are able to use the concept of priority higher but expand that for inclusion of not just the construction phase but how do we use local workforce in our Underserved communities and bring that into our work not only for construction but also for design and project selection and community outreach.,118,,
550,0.97,3649.746,3655.718,This Performance-Based contract will allow us to require that and grow those skills.,118,,
551,0.97,3655.718,3684.147,There are requirements within the contract around business Mentorship and Resourcing . Our last community goal that we are hoping to bring into this contract--we are working on these elements--to leverage our utility dollars for having some of that community space amenities be built into a project but funded outside of the utilities.,118,,
552,0.97,3684.147,3688.785,We call that the whole project.,118,,
553,0.97,3688.785,3697.66,We are able to get all of the Stormwater management and aspects within the utilities mission but also some of the added community amenities that the public decides.,118,,
554,0.97,3697.66,3701.364,"Tracy, House member Morales.",119,,
555,0.97,3701.364,3704.4,Thank you.,120,,
556,0.97,3704.4,3708.704,I appreciate you going through that and particularly Referencing priority higher.,120,,
557,0.97,3708.704,3747.844,Can you talk a little bit about how this process will not just focus on supported mentoring of some community members but will actively draft our piece of minority businesses also encouraged to apply . I know we have a lot of contractors who are moving into this kind of space who don't get contracts like this.,120,,
558,0.97,3747.844,3755.618,We are interested in what ways your reaching out and encouraging newer entities to participate in.,120,,
559,0.97,3755.618,3760.256,Thank you for the question.,121,,
560,0.97,3760.256,3772.468,Our lead and Sam Anderson has been attentive to help ensure how we help pare the larger contractors with some of the smaller contracts for this contract delivery mechanism.,121,,
561,0.97,3772.468,3787.283,"Earlier, we had a listening session to try to help connect the different contracting aspects . It is the Foundational way--it is a performance requirement.",121,,
562,0.97,3787.283,3800.163,It is a requirement for payment that these targets are achieved . It is Foundational to the way the contract is set up.,121,,
563,0.97,3800.163,3801.631,Does that cover what you are asking?,121,,
564,0.97,3801.631,3801.964,Yes.,122,,
565,0.97,3801.964,3807.069,Thank you very much.,122,,
566,0.97,3807.069,3814.977,A little bit more detail and then we will move on to the ordinance.,123,,
567,0.97,3814.977,3818.214,Green and structure work as a whole is work that the Council has directed us to do.,123,,
568,0.97,3818.214,3820.016,You guys probably know lots about it.,123,,
569,0.97,3820.016,3838.501,"If you look at this image on the bottom, we all know that with time, our area was initially Deforested and with time it has become more and more impervious as development happens in all of us move here because it is such a lovely place.",123,,
570,0.97,3838.501,3851.147,"With all of the new impervious surface, creates Stormwater problems . The green infrastructure solution is using the natural systems and natural systems thinking to help solve the Stormwater management problems.",123,,
571,0.97,3851.147,3858.054,We have been leading this nationally.,123,,
572,0.97,3858.054,3863.96,"Since the origin of green infrastructure in early 2000, there is still so much more than that to grow.",123,,
573,0.97,3863.96,3872.468,We are confident that we have the foundation and now we are ready to expand the approach.,123,,
574,0.97,3872.468,3875.972,Our direction was to scale up.,123,,
575,0.97,3875.972,3881.577,Part of the Scaling up has these four primary priorities.,123,,
576,0.97,3881.577,3886.482,I would love to spend lots of time describing what each of these categories are.,123,,
577,0.97,3886.482,3903.766,Today is not the time to get into too much detail but to say that it had been on our radar for number of years to figure out how to expand our delivery modes to allow part of the partnership . We are excited to be at this point in time.,123,,
578,0.97,3903.766,3912.708,Could you go back two slides?,124,,
579,0.97,3912.708,3917.98,I just wanted to point out that photo.,124,,
580,0.97,3917.98,3922.018,That is a dividing line between my district and Councilmember Strauss' district.,124,,
581,0.97,3922.018,3929.792,That was a great photo you included there.,124,,
582,0.97,3929.792,3930.192,Thank you.,125,,
583,0.97,3930.192,3937.033,That idea of partnerships of how do we work with our developers and our community where we can have this green space and--Stormwater management problems have been happening for over 100 years.,125,,
584,0.97,3937.033,3947.91,We can't solve this alone and we really need to help support those kind of enthusiastic Community-Based groups who are trying to manage Stormwater as well.,125,,
585,0.97,3947.91,3954.75,That project is when we are very excited about in trying to make sure we can support more of.,125,,
586,0.97,3954.75,3959.155,Thank you.,126,,
587,0.97,3959.155,3966.062,All this is about existing impervious surface and how do we encourage management of it.,126,,
588,0.97,3966.062,3972.435,We have a Stormwater code for new developments but this is not all of the existing developments.,126,,
589,0.97,3972.435,3978.741,We already have two existing approaches that we help support partnership.,126,,
590,0.97,3978.741,3995.992,"One is the rain wise program which is set up for small roof areas, churches, single-family properties . It is a rebate process . We wanted to grow that program.",126,,
591,0.97,3995.992,4004.5,"As we did a lot of introspection about how to grow partnerships and more areas, we established that this Community- based Public-Private partnership is the way to go.",126,,
592,0.97,4004.5,4024.82,"The other way that we partner with developers and other Community-Based groups is through direct Resourcing and One-On-One Mo a's . that makes sense for really big projects but in order to scale up with lots of small distributed projects, we are interested in this new delivery mode.",126,,
593,0.97,4024.82,4045.941,"Again, it is focused on one contractor, one prime and then they have lots of Subcontractors as part of the program with meeting with the local hiring targets and goals of working with our community.",126,,
594,0.97,4045.941,4056.919,"Then, there is a third-party inspection of sites that are placed in their performance with all of our community priorities.",126,,
595,0.97,4056.919,4058.32,That is the general idea.,126,,
596,0.97,4058.32,4066.829,The Community-Based Piii Foundational he was started by EPA maybe about 10 years ago.,126,,
597,0.97,4066.829,4084.58,It will solve this problem we have of connecting community with our Stormwater and green infrastructure and how can we solve for water quality while increasing our benefits for the community?,126,,
598,0.97,4084.58,4099.595,"Beyond those Stormwater improvements, we have a lot of focus from meeting our store management goals but how can we expand the benefits to our community as we solve those goals?",126,,
599,0.97,4099.595,4129.225,"One of the main aspects of what we can do this work now is because there was a lot of work by state agencies and the Department of Commerce to do the look at is this type of contracting mechanism allowable within Washington state? that analysis was done, led by the Department of Commerce, and established that it is an applicable approach in the state of Washington which made us so we can move forward to this step.",126,,
600,0.97,4129.225,4140.302,"Foundational he, we will be striving to take the base cost of what we need for our Stormwater goals and to increase the values we are delivering.",126,,
601,0.97,4140.302,4156.452,"This first phase, we are starting with an initial project somewhere in the $15 million area and then there will be a future phase after we have grown and learned for a Longer- term contract.",126,,
602,0.97,4156.452,4160.222,"In other parts of the country, these are 20 to 30 year contracts with 100 millions of dollars.",126,,
603,0.97,4160.222,4172.067,We are starting with a place for learning and getting some of our outcomes delivered.,126,,
604,0.97,4172.067,4187.283,"To help understand the kinds of work we are talking about, these are just some Visuals to get understanding of what we mean by Rainwater harvesting, Permeable pavement, restoration, Floatable open space and aspects like that.",126,,
605,0.97,4187.283,4204.767,"We would--the goal is to take existing spaces, this being like a concept of a community gathering space, a community interested in revitalizing it, adding more communities to have it be a gathering space.",126,,
606,0.97,4204.767,4213.976,How can our Stormwater management needs be incorporated into the site design so it is a Win-Win for both the personal owner as well as the utility?,126,,
607,0.97,4213.976,4216.779,Thank you.,127,,
608,0.97,4216.779,4219.682,Councilmember Morales?,127,,
609,0.97,4219.682,4234.296,"A couple of slides back you mentioned impervious surfaces, that sort of thing.",128,,
610,0.97,4234.296,4245.841,"Particular, with this slight about the community center, it is making me wonder if there is any sort of conversation or partnership happening with Sdot as our transportation Department is working on sidewalks or pavement or street.",128,,
611,0.97,4245.841,4254.149,Is there any conversation with them about how to incorporate that into our transportation system?,128,,
612,0.97,4254.149,4257.453,Yes.,129,,
613,0.97,4257.453,4260.656,Sdot has been a good partner with us over the years.,129,,
614,0.97,4260.656,4269.031,"For the last 15 years, we have done a large number of bio retention and roadway projects.",129,,
615,0.97,4269.031,4274.37,We are in partnership with Sdot.,129,,
616,0.97,4274.37,4275.804,Sometimes they install Permeable pavement.,129,,
617,0.97,4275.804,4278.374,It is one of our Stormwater code requirements.,129,,
618,0.97,4278.374,4291.887,We have not started the pavement in the Streetscape but more in the parking areas and in the kind of slightly lower use areas.,129,,
619,0.97,4291.887,4304.6,It is an approach . We do work in partnership with Sdot for sure.,129,,
620,0.97,4304.6,4305.401,Any other thoughts?,130,,
621,0.97,4305.401,4324.319,"We have gone so far as having standard details and plans and Specs so that we worked through a lot of the innovation on how we do this kind of work . It is a tool that people can use, for sure.",131,,
622,0.97,4324.319,4331.827,"The real question is, it was great that we are encouraging private property owners to be looking at using this.",132,,
623,0.97,4331.827,4341.837,"I am wondering, as a municipality, if we are moving in the direction of trying to do that as a matter of our public infrastructure.",132,,
624,0.97,4341.837,4343.338,We are moving in the direction.,133,,
625,0.97,4343.338,4344.44,We could still move further.,133,,
626,0.97,4344.44,4347.309,Thank you for that.,134,,
627,0.97,4347.309,4351.146,May I add a few things from that question?,135,,
628,0.97,4351.146,4352.548,"Thank you for that question, Councilmember.",136,,
629,0.97,4352.548,4366.562,"A few years back, we had any requirement in our Stormwater permit that required citywide to incorporate the infrastructure and Low-Impact development techniques in all Land-Use codes.",136,,
630,0.97,4366.562,4373.669,We did that look citywide back in 2015.,136,,
631,0.97,4373.669,4387.149,New requirements were incorporated into both land use code and the Right-Of-Way improvement to what we know as streets illustrated to provide this kind of information into a citywide code.,136,,
632,0.97,4387.149,4423.919,Spu does have a whole other program called the Natura Partnering program that is focused on Partnering with Sdot to do our own retrofit projects where we can get--many of those projects a regional scale meaning they manage a larger contributing Basin of runoff in the Right-Of-Way . It is Superhigh value for our rate payers and also a very complex project.,136,,
633,0.97,4423.919,4427.923,This program is focused on working on that.,136,,
634,0.97,4427.923,4432.594,Thank you.,137,,

805,0.97,5384.645,5397.859,"When our city auditor provides is look back on retroactive Technologies next year, we can have him double check the Technologies that Sdot has in place for traffic management.",197,,
806,0.97,5397.859,5411.005,But let's hear now from our panelists from both Sdot and the Seattle office of information technology . good morning.,197,,
807,0.97,5411.005,5411.439,"Hello, everyone.",198,,
808,0.97,5411.439,5415.51,I am Jason from Sdot.,198,,
809,0.97,5415.51,5419.714,Good morning.,199,,
810,0.97,5419.714,5424.519,I will go ahead and get started.,200,,
811,0.97,5424.519,5433.761,I am the data and technology manager for the operations division at Sdot and responsible for managing both the Acyclica and license plate reader systems.,200,,
812,0.97,5433.761,5440.735,Just as a quick update we completed the Council review for license plate readers and 2019.,200,,
813,0.97,5440.735,5452.346,And as Councilmember Peterson stated we are requesting to hold the submission for Acyclica.,200,,
814,0.97,5452.346,5454.582,We have an alternative that we feel should provide greater benefit to both Sdot and the community.,200,,
815,0.97,5454.582,5461.122,We use both of these to gather travel Informationto improve our decision-making and provide it to the public.,200,,
816,0.97,5461.122,5469.23,Travelers can make more informed trip any decisions.,200,,
817,0.97,5469.23,5470.298,The license plate readers were installed in 2011.,200,,
818,0.97,5470.298,5475.169,They are an aging legacy technology.,200,,
819,0.97,5475.169,5476.204,It is no longer supported by other vendors.,200,,
820,0.97,5476.204,5477.138,We need to come up with an alternative.,200,,
821,0.97,5477.138,5480.808,In 2019 we recommended that alternative would be Acyclica.,200,,
822,0.97,5480.808,5486.814,"Similarly, Acyclica is a--it is installed in traffic cabinets.",200,,
823,0.97,5486.814,5499.794,We began deploying that system in 2014 and we completed a pretty exhaustive analysis of alternatives and we published a white paper at that time about our findings.,200,,
824,0.97,5499.794,5507.268,We built in the privacy requirements and Acyclica hired an independent security form to perform an audit.,200,,
825,0.97,5507.268,5509.537,There was never been a breach or other incident that would cause concern regarding the privacy practices.,200,,
826,0.97,5509.537,5527.622,But when we did engage with the relationship with Acyclica we were an intermediary Acyclica was functioning as an independent company and then in 2018 they were acquired by [Indiscernible]. They are big players in the transportation space.,200,,
827,0.97,5527.622,5530.825,In May of this year it was acquired by [Indiscernible].,200,,
828,0.97,5530.825,5539.4,From our perspective the relationship was just getting a bit diluted.,200,,
829,0.97,5539.4,5545.206,We were still working for the same small team but there was improvements to alternatives and we feel like it is time to modernize . and we are committed to the substantial removal of the systems by the end of the year.,200,,
830,0.97,5545.206,5554.282,And ultimately requesting that both Lpr and Acyclica be removed from the surveillance ordinance master list.,200,,
831,0.97,5554.282,5555.416,Next slide.,200,,
832,0.97,5555.416,5560.221,That solution is Pro-Data.,200,,
833,0.97,5560.221,5564.225,We did look at it back in 2014 when we selected Acyclica.,200,,
834,0.97,5564.225,5569.363,It was not mature enough yet.,200,,
835,0.97,5569.363,5570.665,The date of focused on highways and less on city streets.,200,,
836,0.97,5570.665,5582.443,"Today with the emergence of Uber and lift there are more connected vehicles, Fleet management systems and this is becoming more attractive.",200,,
837,0.97,5582.443,5582.743,What is it?,200,,
838,0.97,5582.743,5585.479,There are big vendors.,200,,
839,0.97,5585.479,5602.496,"And they enter into business relationships and acquire connected vehicle movement data from automotive manufacturers, Gps providers, in vehicle navigation systems, trucking companies, Fleet service providers.",200,,
840,0.97,5602.496,5614.075,And they provide back to consumers the speed and travel time data which can have nothing that is personally identifiable.,200,,
841,0.97,5614.075,5616.811,This removes Sdot from the data collection process which we are currently engaged in.,200,,
842,0.97,5616.811,5624.418,And will simply be consumers of data that is already out there.,200,,
843,0.97,5624.418,5625.853,"If we go this direction are not, the data is already available.",200,,
844,0.97,5625.853,5627.321,Transportation agencies across the country have done some research.,200,,
845,0.97,5627.321,5636.931,"Los Angeles Metro, Bellevue, New York City, Washington, D.C., about 30 different agencies have already transition to this approach.",200,,
846,0.97,5636.931,5643.504,We would not be tip of the spear and we also hired a consultant to review the accuracy of the data from eight different vendors.,200,,
847,0.97,5643.504,5652.847,In a produce a report confirming it is a viable alternative at least from a data accuracy perspective.,200,,
848,0.97,5652.847,5662.023,"Moving this direction, it aids our departments goals of improving safety and equity and reducing the climate impact.",200,,
849,0.97,5662.023,5666.761,We see it as Win-Win.,200,,
850,0.97,5666.761,5673.601,"We will have speed information for the entire city, currently if we need to know this beat of a corridor we need to set up equipment into a study.",200,,
851,0.97,5673.601,5678.739,Now we will have speed information for every major artery in our city.,200,,
852,0.97,5678.739,5685.479,It can provide benefit to multiple different teams and initiatives with an organization . It can be tied to the speed limit production safety goals.,200,,
853,0.97,5685.479,5691.685,As we reach our climate goals it becomes more of a focus for our organization.,200,,
854,0.97,5691.685,5702.997,We will have Metrics and be able to Strategize and see what I a success criteria we are trying to reach as we work toward our climate initiatives and goals.,200,,
855,0.97,5702.997,5703.831,"Additionally, it increases equity.",200,,
856,0.97,5703.831,5705.833,Now we only have data from the streets that are outfitted with the Lpr or Tran 11 hardware.,200,,
857,0.97,5705.833,5711.906,"When you move the data, all neighborhoods will be represented equally.",200,,
858,0.97,5711.906,5725.319,We will have the same amount and types of data were all the neighborhoods in our city which will allow us to hopefully reduce bias from our Decision- making and empower engineers to be more equitable in the way they approach projects.,200,,
859,0.97,5725.319,5732.226,We submitted for privacy reviews for the top probe data vendors.,200,,
860,0.97,5732.226,5738.532,And the privacy team will discuss the results of that evaluation.,200,,
861,0.97,5738.532,5740.434,"The morning, committee.",201,,
862,0.97,5740.434,5741.302,Thank you.,201,,
863,0.97,5741.302,5756.083,"As Jason mentioned, he reviewed new acquisitions and we view these reviews on technologies to make sure they are not running into privacy or surveillance concerns.",201,,
864,0.97,5756.083,5763.924,"From the information provided by Jason and the vendor, we can confirm these solutions do not contain any personable identifiable information.",201,,
865,0.97,5763.924,5775.87,"They are aggregating the data and Bash most importantly from our perspective, the solution no longer relies on the license plates.",201,,
866,0.97,5775.87,5786.947,"Although Sdot was not in possession of license plates, they were being sent to--to be included.",201,,
867,0.97,5786.947,5791.051,These solutions do not include that or any other unique Identifiers.,201,,
868,0.97,5791.051,5805.166,"With Acyclica there were addresses used on mobile devices . and even though it was a complex Encryption method that was used, they are being removed from the equation.",201,,
869,0.97,5805.166,5806.6,There is no identifiable information at all in this Datastream.,201,,
870,0.97,5806.6,5830.024,"As a result, these solutions do not meet the definition provided Sierra--and this data does not include any personally identifiable information.",201,,
871,0.97,5830.024,5831.692,Thank you.,202,,
872,0.97,5831.692,5838.065,I want to commend Sdot are doing their due diligence on the new technology.,202,,
873,0.97,5838.065,5841.302,So that we could have a better solution in place going forward.,202,,
874,0.97,5841.302,5847.541,And provide that traffic management data in a better way.,202,,
875,0.97,5847.541,5856.05,I know it is a lot of work when you have to keep renewing things and looking for better ways of doing things.,202,,
876,0.97,5856.05,5861.755,And to do all that due diligence again and to start over on it . Thank you for doing that.,202,,
877,0.97,5861.755,5863.858,I also want to thank information technology folks.,202,,
878,0.97,5863.858,5884.178,"This entire process that we have gone through with the surveillance ordinance, it is amazing how seamless it has been in terms of it working with all the departments through the city who have different Technologies.",202,,
879,0.97,5884.178,5885.946,The collaborative approach and the executive on this issue has been really helpful.,202,,
880,0.97,5885.946,5888.482,I just wanted to compliment everybody involved in bringing these Technologies.,202,,
881,0.97,5888.482,5897.891,We will see that in our next one will we talk about the fire Department items that will be hopefully improving.,202,,
882,0.97,5897.891,5910.404,"Council members, any questions about this technology that will now be phased out this year?",202,,
883,0.97,5910.404,5911.672,We saw in central staff has been tracking this carefully.,202,,
884,0.97,5911.672,5928.922,"If there were no questions today, I encourage you to follow up with the city council central staff who can provide you the information on this.",202,,
885,0.97,5930.09,5932.293,I want to thank both Sdot and the information technology folks for bringing this presentation to us.,202,,
886,0.97,5932.293,5936.93,"These materials are Online for those viewing this, if they want to check out more of this.",202,,
887,0.97,5936.93,5942.169,To go ahead and move on to the next item.,202,,
888,0.97,5942.169,5946.84,Which is also surveillance related.,202,,
889,0.97,5946.84,5955.082,"Council members, let's have the committee clerk read the next and final item into the record.",202,,
890,0.97,5955.082,5963.257,Agenda item Council bill 120171.,203,,
891,0.97,5963.257,5975.269,An ordinance relating to surveillance technology implementation authorizing approval of uses and accepting surveillance impact reports for the Seattle fire departments use of emergency seen cameras and hazardous materials cameras.,203,,
892,0.97,5975.269,5979.573,"For briefing, discussion and possible vote.",203,,
893,0.97,5979.573,5980.274,Thank you.,204,,
894,0.97,5980.274,5990.484,"Colleagues, this Council bill is a single piece of legislation that includes two surveillance impact ports on Technologies used by the fire Department.",204,,
895,0.97,5990.484,6001.261,Hazardous materials cameras and cameras for other emergency scenes.,204,,
896,0.97,6001.261,6002.296,We will discuss and vote on this legislation.,204,,
897,0.97,6002.296,6009.77,Which will complete batch number 4A of the technology list.,204,,
898,0.97,6009.77,6016.21,"The list of existing technology, surveillance Technologies that we have been improving under the surveillance ordinance.",204,,
899,0.97,6016.21,6020.714,"He will see when we talk about these technologies, it is just cameras.",204,,
900,0.97,6020.714,6027.921,"But we want to make sure that we honor the definition in the ordinance for surveillance, technology.",204,,
901,0.97,6027.921,6031.992,So they have been included in the list.,204,,
902,0.97,6031.992,6032.96,We have gone through the full process here.,204,,
903,0.97,6032.96,6046.14,Let's go ahead . I did want to offer an opportunity to Lisa if she did want to say anything and thank her for her memo that she circulated on this.,204,,
904,0.97,6046.14,6049.443,Thank you chair Pedersen.,205,,
905,0.97,6049.443,6058.952,I think I have some comments but I can make to introduce the legislation after the fire Department talks a little bit more about what the cameras do and how they are used.,205,,
906,0.97,6058.952,6066.16,Thank you.,206,,
907,0.97,6066.16,6068.729,Hello.,207,,
908,0.97,6068.729,6076.236,My name is Evan ward and I am with the Seattle fire Department.,207,,
909,0.97,6076.236,6076.77,Thank you for having me.,207,,
910,0.97,6076.77,6078.338,Hopefully you can hear me okay.,207,,
911,0.97,6078.338,6081.842,I'm sure my voice is obscured.,207,,
912,0.97,6081.842,6087.481,I need to wear a face covering since I have colleagues around me.,207,,
913,0.97,6087.481,6093.654,"As chair Pedersen describe, this is a really simple technology we all use all the time.",207,,
914,0.97,6093.654,6107.568,Just the typical Digital Point- And-Shoot cameras . But we use them and really three ways.,207,,
915,0.97,6113.64,6115.342,I don't want to go into too much about the actual make and model of the cameras.,207,,
916,0.97,6115.342,6116.81,But really how we use them.,207,,
917,0.97,6116.81,6122.216,As you can see we've got a chief holding one of the cameras.,207,,
918,0.97,6122.216,6123.884,He is a safety chief.,207,,
919,0.97,6123.884,6132.025,"Essentially, they will show up to certain incidents or a firefighter potentially could have been injured.",207,,
920,0.97,6132.025,6140.701,They are not taking photos of the firefighters or other individuals.,207,,
921,0.97,6140.701,6142.202,This is to document the certain equipment used and stuff like that.,207,,
922,0.97,6142.202,6147.174,They also show up to traffic collisions involving SF Fd apparatus.,207,,
923,0.97,6147.174,6154.948,"To be clear, just SF Fd apparatus we don't take pictures of people.",207,,
924,0.97,6154.948,6158.952,We only take pictures of the vehicles involved when the collision involves the Seattle fire Department vehicle.,207,,
925,0.97,6158.952,6168.061,Those are used for the collision investigations internally.,207,,
926,0.97,6168.061,6181.875,"And we also have--in our policy and operating guidelines, related to using cameras at certain medical emergencies.",207,,
927,0.97,6181.875,6183.277,This is extremely rare.,207,,
928,0.97,6183.277,6191.919,I have spoken to Paramedics and folks at the medic Battalion.,207,,
929,0.97,6191.919,6192.386,It is extremely rare.,207,,
930,0.97,6192.386,6197.691,"But if they're going to use it, it is a camera that is stored in the drug safe on the apparatus.",207,,
931,0.97,6197.691,6199.459,That is like where all the control drugs are.,207,,
932,0.97,6199.459,6203.297,So you need a Passcode.,207,,
933,0.97,6203.297,6209.703,It has a full audit log that you can see to Whoever uses it.,207,,
934,0.97,6209.703,6218.879,We take it very seriously if are going to actually take pictures of the patient . The only reason we would do that is to document the mechanism of injury.,207,,
935,0.97,6218.879,6223.717,"Of the old saying goes, a picture is worth 1000 words.",207,,
936,0.97,6223.717,6231.024,It can be useful to provide some visual information emergency room staff.,207,,
937,0.97,6231.024,6233.126,When we transfer the patient to their care.,207,,
938,0.97,6233.126,6241.902,We have strict policies that we do not retain those photos of patients.,207,,
939,0.97,6241.902,6242.903,Those are immediately deleted from the camera.,207,,
940,0.97,6242.903,6252.946,They never leave the camera itself . they do literally take the camera and go to the er doctors and show them the photos and then they Delete them.,207,,
941,0.97,6252.946,6254.047,And it goes back into the controlled drug safe.,207,,
942,0.97,6254.047,6257.351,That is really the three ways we use them.,207,,
943,0.97,6257.351,6276.67,"In terms of protection, for the traffic collisions involving Seattle fire Department vehicles, those are stored on a department Database, that is safe and secure and accessible only to the safety chief's themselves.",207,,
944,0.97,6276.67,6284.745,They are used for essentially Investigaing our own collisions.,207,,
945,0.97,6284.745,6286.079,I hope that is clear.,207,,
946,0.97,6286.079,6295.756,The other thing is about the medic response . We don't store them.,207,,
947,0.97,6295.756,6302.696,The cameras themselves are kept in a incredibly secure location inside is safe on only certain medic apparatus.,207,,
948,0.97,6302.696,6304.364,There is also access controls when it comes to that.,207,,
949,0.97,6304.364,6309.703,About the pin code needed and everything.,207,,
950,0.97,6309.703,6311.705,It is only those Paramedics that can use it.,207,,
951,0.97,6311.705,6315.776,And it is only on the few medic units that provide advanced life support.,207,,
952,0.97,6315.776,6319.413,It is not on every rig.,207,,
953,0.97,6319.413,6333.927,"The safety chief's, excuse me, the fire investigators use cameras for documenting certain types of fire incidents.",207,,
954,0.97,6333.927,6344.337,We generally perform a fire investigation when there is potentially suspected arson.,207,,
955,0.97,6344.337,6345.238,The we are not the arson investigators.,207,,
956,0.97,6345.238,6351.545,That is done by the Seattle police arson and bomb squad.,207,,
957,0.97,6351.545,6361.154,The pictures we do take for our fire investigations are stored on a secure Database.,207,,
958,0.97,6361.154,6362.389,Only accessible by Membersof our fire investigation unit.,207,,
959,0.97,6362.389,6366.259,Which is a very small team.,207,,
960,0.97,6366.259,6375.635,I think we can move on from the emergency scene cameras.,207,,
961,0.97,6375.635,6379.773,The next is hazardous materials cameras.,207,,
962,0.97,6379.773,6382.175,I would say it is more like a hazardous material camera.,207,,
963,0.97,6382.175,6395.055,"To be clear of what this is, it is literally an Ipad that they use.",207,,
964,0.97,6395.055,6396.823,"And Hazmat team, if they show up to a Hazmat response, there are not that many.",207,,
965,0.97,6396.823,6407.868,But they will take that Ipad and put in front of them and walk around to show via a live feed to the captain of the has met unit on the rig.,207,,
966,0.97,6407.868,6409.302,There is a monitor on the rig and it is streamed in real time.,207,,
967,0.97,6409.302,6421.181,And all that is is to basically give the captain a good visual line of sight on what may be inside a building.,207,,
968,0.97,6421.181,6430.19,It is possible for them to record or take snapshots . My experience is that it is extremely uncommon.,207,,
969,0.97,6430.19,6439.032,Generally if there is going to be some sort of investigation done that would be handled by the fire investigation unit.,207,,
970,0.97,6439.032,6451.545,"Like I said, my experience in speaking with the captain of the Hazmat unit, actually taking pictures or videos is extremely rare, when it is done it is stored on a secure Seattle fire Department Database.",207,,
971,0.97,6451.545,6457.851,Accessible only to members of the Hazmat team.,207,,
972,0.97,6457.851,6460.353,I think that is really it.,207,,
973,0.97,6460.353,6466.359,In terms of--I hope that is all clear and make sense.,207,,
974,0.97,6466.359,6466.76,Thank you.,208,,
975,0.97,6466.76,6473.066,Now we will hear from our city council central staff.,208,,
976,0.97,6473.066,6474.034,Lisa tracks the surveillance items for us.,208,,
977,0.97,6474.034,6488.181,"There is also an amendment 1 on the agenda, which was recommended by central staff and we will talk about that as well.",208,,
978,0.97,6488.181,6503.096,Thank you chair Pedersen and thank you for offering to run the slides it is helpful I am Lisa.,209,,
979,0.97,6503.096,6507.834,I will be brief in his introduction to the legislation.,209,,
980,0.97,6507.834,6516.443,Counsel bill 120171 would approve the fire Department's continued use of the emergency scene cameras and hazardous materials cameras.,209,,
981,0.97,6516.443,6522.382,And accept the reports for each one of them.,209,,
982,0.97,6522.382,6533.393,The fire Department does plan to adopt more detailed operating policies for the cameras following negotiations with labor partners . You will hear more about that later on.,209,,
983,0.97,6533.393,6549.91,The emergency scene cameras are used to provide images of trauma patients to emergency room doctors by the fire investigation unit and to help document safety investigations of collisions involving fire Department vehicles.,209,,
984,0.97,6549.91,6563.757,The hazardous materials cameras are apple Ipad cameras use together with Encrypted Videoconferencing to help identify potentially hazardous materials from a safe distance.,209,,
985,0.97,6563.757,6573.266,Next slide . The fire Department received very limited public comments on these Technologies.,209,,
986,0.97,6573.266,6574.434,I think they had two comments on each type of camera.,209,,
987,0.97,6574.434,6581.741,But the community surveillance working group did submit recommendations in its 2018 civil liberties and privacy impact assessment.,209,,
988,0.97,6581.741,6596.156,"Is recommendations focus primarily on the purpose and use of the cameras, retention of data and sharing of the data with third parties, especially law-enforcement agencies.",209,,
989,0.97,6596.156,6605.298,You will see on pages 4-9 of staff report additional details about those recommendations including a table that summarizes whether and how the recommendations were addressed.,209,,
990,0.97,6605.298,6610.27,Next slide.,209,,
991,0.97,6610.27,6618.812,Pages 10 and 11 of the staff memo was several policy considerations drawn from my review of the surveillance impact report and of the surveillance working group recommendations.,209,,
992,0.97,6618.812,6634.027,The first one is--in notes that many citations in the surveillance impact report NOTE the Department is developing a comprehensive operating policies that will become effective if supported during upcoming labor negotiations.,209,,
993,0.97,6634.027,6642.235,In some ways there is still some work in progress.,209,,
994,0.97,6642.235,6649.376,The next three considerations identified policies that have not been addressed in the current version of the surveillance impact report including guidelines for transferring the photos or the videos off the cameras.,209,,
995,0.97,6649.376,6652.579,Retention requirements other than injury photos.,209,,
996,0.97,6652.579,6656.916,Requirements for how and when data is shared with Law- enforcement.,209,,
997,0.97,6656.916,6660.453,And specific privacy protections for individuals.,209,,
998,0.97,6660.453,6665.025,Next slide.,209,,
999,0.97,6665.025,6676.569,"Should the committee choose to act today, you have two options that would address these considerations.",209,,
1000,0.97,6676.569,6683.276,The first one would be to pass a single amendment requesting that the fire Department file a revised surveillance impact report with the clerk following labor negotiations.,209,,
1001,0.97,6683.276,6697.49,This option recognizes that the fire Department tends to update the current policies and the amendment would Bash the surveillance ordinance requires material changes would bring the surveillance impact report for Council approval.,209,,
1002,0.97,6697.49,6704.564,And that is the amendment that chair Pedersen Referenced.,209,,
1003,0.97,6704.564,6709.402,It is included in the packet.,209,,
1004,0.97,6709.402,6722.315,The committee could pass amendments today that request that the fire Department develop specific policies or protocols if there is concern that these may not be addressed in the fire departments updated policies.,209,,
1005,0.97,6722.315,6724.984,"Chair Pedersen, would you like me to introduce your amendment also?",209,,
1006,0.97,6724.984,6725.819,Yes.,210,,
1007,0.97,6725.819,6726.119,Thank you.,210,,
1008,0.97,6726.119,6737.831,"As I mentioned, chair Pedersen has sponsored an amendment which would enact the first option.",211,,
1009,0.97,6737.831,6765.291,"It asked that the fire Department prepare a revised surveillance impact report with more comprehensive policies following negotiations that would address the use and operation of the cameras, privacy protections, record retention schedules . The fire Department has already subject to the state retention schedule but does not have been documented in the policy mentioned.",211,,
1010,0.97,6765.291,6770.663,And another that the policies would address protocols for sharing data with Law- enforcement and training.,211,,
1011,0.97,6770.663,6774.868,And that is what I have to present to you today.,211,,
1012,0.97,6774.868,6786.946,"Thank you, Lisa and thank you to the fire Department and thanks for it for working . You are part of the process here for us.",212,,
1013,0.97,6786.946,6789.582,Councilmember Herbold.,212,,
1014,0.97,6789.582,6796.289,Can you go back to the slide we have listed the options?,213,,
1015,0.97,6796.289,6796.623,Thank you.,213,,
1016,0.97,6796.623,6803.863,One option is the option that chair Pedersen is proposing and that is the first bullet.,213,,
1017,0.97,6803.863,6810.77,"And you are saying there is a second option, where there are subject specific amendments.",213,,
1018,0.97,6810.77,6815.408,I just want to understand.,213,,
1019,0.97,6815.408,6827.954,The second option is the approach of separating out the amendments that chair Pedersen is are you proposing.,213,,
1020,0.97,6827.954,6831.291,Is that correct?,213,,
1021,0.97,6831.291,6831.658,Pretty much.,214,,
1022,0.97,6831.658,6855.849,I just want to make sure that the second option was still a request of a revised one and not that you were saying we could require these changes.,214,,
1023,0.97,6857.684,6865.825,"I remember receiving in the past we raised issues of changes that we wanted, is that we don't have the option of requiring changes.",214,,
1024,0.97,6865.825,6866.826,We only have an option of requesting them.,214,,
1025,0.97,6866.826,6877.67,The fact that they have to come back to us and prove before they could use the technology is definitely a hook.,214,,
1026,0.97,6877.67,6888.248,"But given most of what we are proving, are Backlogged technologies, if I recall correctly that are already in use.",214,,
1027,0.97,6888.248,6894.787,That hook is not quite as effective as it would be with new technologies.,214,,
1028,0.97,6894.787,6895.788,Exactly right.,215,,
1029,0.97,6895.788,6895.989,Yes.,215,,
