189,0.97,1109.975,1113.512,Once you heard the prompt that's your Cue that it is your turn to speak.,69,,
190,0.97,1113.512,1127.125,I ask that you begin speaking by stating your name and the item which you're addressing.,69,,
191,0.97,1128.727,1136.768,"After the conclusion of your two minutes, staff will turn off your Mic so you whether be muted again.",69,,
192,0.97,1136.768,1148.113,"So at the conclusion of the two minutes, we will no longer be able to hear your remark after the two minute mark.",69,,
193,0.97,1148.113,1163.495,"Once you Completeed the public comment we ask that you Disconnect, once you completed the public comment, we ask that you Disconnect from the line and you can continue to watch us on our Website.",69,,
194,0.97,1163.495,1178.61,"We will begin with the first speaking on the list and colleagues for your benefit, we have about 20 or so folks who are registered and present.",69,,
195,0.97,1178.61,1188.287,So there's a chance that we will need to extend public comment period for a few minutes to allow everyone to testify.,69,,
196,0.97,1188.287,1194.593,But as this point I'm allotting 20 minutes and it's 2:25 P.M.,69,,
197,0.97,1194.593,1202.301,So we'll go until 2:45 P.M.,69,,

199,0.97,1216.381,1218.65,The first Speaker is Ryan Moreno.,69,,
200,0.97,1218.65,1220.986,Designer review does not stop Gentrification.,70,,
201,0.97,1220.986,1227.659,When we look around at our neighborhood 70% of the land is zoned exclusively for single family housing.,70,,
202,0.97,1227.659,1234.333,"If a modest home is bought, Bulldozed and Redeveloped as a $2 million Mansion the project does not go through design review.",70,,
203,0.97,1234.333,1240.772,They don't have to hold a public meeting and they do not need approval from the design review board.,70,,
204,0.97,1240.772,1247.246,95% of our new housing comes from project under design review.,70,,
205,0.97,1247.246,1248.981,Design review is also not acceptable.,70,,
206,0.97,1248.981,1263.061,"The meetings are held on weeknights and do not give opportunity for hotel workers, restaurant workers or working parents to attend and provide public comment.",70,,
207,0.97,1263.061,1270.936,This is not the kind of equity that the board review is supposed to provide.,70,,
208,0.97,1270.936,1282.014,I trust them more than a board of volunteers and more than comments a few of my neighbors.,70,,
209,0.97,1282.014,1288.92,The best looking apartment building in my neighborhood was approved without the design review worth Waying in.,70,,
210,0.97,1288.92,1296.728,I urge you to pass this measure and avoid delay of our future's growth and development.,70,,
211,0.97,1296.728,1319.418,I hope this motion allows you a chance for equitable change for this program.,70,,

230,0.97,1451.75,1462.027,We've also met with Council member Pederson's office to coordinate a passage forward.,74,,
231,0.97,1462.027,1470.368,"At that time, I told Council member Lacata that I hoped the proposed Bia would be better than what we had at the time.",74,,
232,0.97,1470.368,1481.58,"Now after five years and almost $5 million invested, it is not Clea to many of my fellow neighbors including property owners, small business owners and tenants if that experiment was a success.",74,,

239,0.97,1525.757,1532.097,We urge the passage of this legislation with the Morales amendment.,76,,
240,0.97,1532.097,1545.076,We sent a letter detailing what we thought would serve the International district best and they were signed by several reservations with certain people with the International district.,76,,
241,0.97,1545.076,1547.512,That is included in the miles amendment.,76,,

245,0.97,1576.841,1577.642,Speaking on Cb11979.,78,,
246,0.97,1577.642,1586.217,I asked the Council not to approve this legislation without setting a two month deadline for restoring public participation and design review.,79,,
247,0.97,1586.217,1604.135,"Open government is built on public input and the argument that six months is needed due to the complexity of Online meetings is under cut daily as scores of city departments, businesses and individuals have adapted by going Online.",79,,
248,0.97,1604.135,1614.512,In over two weeks since this bill was introduced there's been no bill for how the public would have input over the last two months.,79,,
249,0.97,1614.512,1626.625,I find project documents are regularly posted weeks and sometimes months after a review has been completed giving the public no chance to comment.,79,,
250,0.97,1626.625,1629.294,Director Torgelson says the Department is already his top priority.,79,,
251,0.97,1629.294,1641.606,The real target of this legislation appears to be market rate commercial development and today and last week we heard some in the design and development community say administrative reviews should be the city's standard policy.,79,,
252,0.97,1641.606,1644.442,If so this measure is a good start.,79,,
253,0.97,1644.442,1650.048,Without a two month time line and clear process for public input in the interim.,79,,
254,0.97,1650.048,1653.952,This emergency legislation SETS land use policy for as long as the rest of the year.,79,,
255,0.97,1653.952,1662.661,It sends the message that the public input is a hindrance and the first thing to go in an emergency.,79,,
256,0.97,1662.661,1663.061,Thank you.,79,,
257,0.97,1663.061,1667.499,Thank you for calling in.,80,,
258,0.97,1667.499,1674.172,Our next Speaker is Justin Alegro.,80,,
259,0.97,1674.172,1684.916,Thank you Council members my name is Justin Allegro I'm Commenting in support of the proposed review Ordnance.,81,,
260,0.97,1684.916,1686.651,I admit I'm not review expert.,81,,
261,0.97,1686.651,1707.172,I live in a detached home and I'm currently an elected board member of the Queen Anne board Council.,81,,
262,0.97,1707.172,1715.18,Our city faces gigantic struggles through this pandemic.,81,,
263,0.97,1715.18,1746.744,I now with Federal and state stimulus forthcoming and private financing less and less secure each day we don't want to hear we lost opportunity because we did not look at the when they can't be held correctly.,81,,
264,0.97,1746.744,1753.284,"This is for our policy so we can learn from our last recession and help our city, thank you.",81,,
265,0.97,1753.284,1757.188,Thank you so much for calling in today.,82,,
266,0.97,1757.188,1766.965,Our next Speaker is going to be Rick Mcloughlin.,82,,
267,0.97,1766.965,1783.748,I'm the President of the U district Association and the owner of the brewery on the.,83,,
268,0.97,1783.748,1791.856,The current crisis is severely Impacting the ability of local small businesses to survive.,83,,
269,0.97,1791.856,1805.27,"Assessment, fees paid through our triple net leases which can trickle down economics is a further burden at an inopportune time.",83,,
270,0.97,1805.27,1813.878,"So far we've had Vias in our area and I wouldn't necessarily say that, the small business community is thriving right now.",83,,
271,0.97,1813.878,1820.952,Performance is mixed and does not justify an increase from the five year to 12 year term.,83,,
272,0.97,1820.952,1822.02,Budget increases of 10%.,83,,
273,0.97,1822.02,1830.061,I would say we need to have justification and we need to have data showing success before we increase those limits.,83,,
274,0.97,1830.061,1835.066,We invite the Council to consider amendments to approve the draft legislation.,83,,
275,0.97,1835.066,1851.783,And in my point of view before we go forward I would say we need to see some data showing that it's working and I would say that we need to talk to a bunch of small businesses and get assessments from them and see what their input is and go forward from there.,83,,
276,0.97,1851.783,1852.083,Thank you.,83,,
277,0.97,1852.083,1855.253,Thank you for calling in today.,84,,
278,0.97,1855.253,1861.793,Our next public Commenter is Susan grant.,84,,
279,0.97,1861.793,1862.293,Hello.,85,,
280,0.97,1862.293,1864.162,Thank you for taking my call.,85,,
281,0.97,1864.162,1866.364,I am Susan grant.,85,,
282,0.97,1866.364,1873.271,And I am concerned about I'm talking about CB bill 119769.,85,,
283,0.97,1873.271,1878.843,I'm concerned about suspending or watering down Seattle's model design review process.,85,,
284,0.97,1878.843,1886.818,City Hall has already watered down the process for real estate development process for our own communities our own neighborhoods.,85,,
285,0.97,1886.818,1902.133,"Design review is one of the very last ways to improve the quality of real estate development project before they are built and the only way to effectively save the mature trees that we have left in our urban forest which by the way, are rapidly disappearing.",85,,
286,0.97,1902.133,1908.906,Trees cannot be built like houses can.,85,,
287,0.97,1908.906,1920.184,Without meaningful input we see naturally occurring affordable housing.,85,,
288,0.97,1920.184,1926.524,This not only displaces existing residents but it can go into Inaffordability.,85,,
289,0.97,1926.524,1930.995,Many low income housing projects would have the review process canceled entirely.,85,,
290,0.97,1930.995,1946.11,I believe lower income Renters and owners deserve the same benefits of a design review process that can result in higher quality residential buildings as well as a tree County that benefits the health of the residents they are in.,85,,
291,0.97,1946.11,1952.884,Please stand up for the citizens of Seattle who want to have input in rebuilding designs and wish to save our trees.,85,,
292,0.97,1952.884,1957.422,Many of you promised during your campaigns to listen to the citizens.,85,,
293,0.97,1957.422,1962.026,Well now is your chance to do so.,85,,
294,0.97,1962.026,1965.463,Please vote no on Cb119769.,85,,
295,0.97,1965.463,1966.664,Thank you.,85,,
296,0.97,1966.664,1974.305,"Thank you, our next Speaker is Marty Coistra.",86,,
297,0.97,1974.305,1989.253,Good afternoon Council members thank you Council President Gonzalez for this opportunity.,87,,
298,0.97,1989.253,1991.622,I'm Marty Coistra.,87,,
299,0.97,1991.622,1998.396,I'm calling today to speak in favor of Council bill 119769.,87,,
300,0.97,1998.396,2015.213,We believe any emergency response package should Prioritize supporting affordable housing production amidst a crisis we're now facing which is only exacerbating and will continue to exacerbate what we know as the affordable housing crisis.,87,,
301,0.97,2015.213,2028.726,The affordable housing exemption from the process is an important step to expedite affordable housing process and start meeting this exacerbated need now.,87,,
302,0.97,2028.726,2042.807,I do not want to speak Detrimentally.,87,,
303,0.97,2042.807,2051.082,We sat out a few years ago to completely Rework the design review process to expedite the production of housing.,87,,
304,0.97,2051.082,2056.22,We still have a long ways conversation we will have once this crisis is behind us.,87,,
305,0.97,2056.22,2066.03,We will also talk about design review and its comparison to the Red lining of the past and it's potential detrimental effects from equity.,87,,
306,0.97,2066.03,2073.671,We all benefit when we Prioritize the needs of the lowest income and more marginalized people by creating affordable housing.,87,,
307,0.97,2073.671,2089.187,"The members of Hdc who do this very, very difficult and mentally stressful work on the day-to-day basis can tell you more about design review and they can also talk about their passion toward quality.",87,,
308,0.97,2089.187,2107.171,I hear the comments being made about how design review on affordable housing can impact.,87,,
309,0.97,2107.171,2111.943,Thank you Marty for being with us.,88,,
310,0.97,2111.943,2119.283,Our next Speaker is June bluster.,88,,
311,0.97,2119.283,2119.584,Hello.,89,,
312,0.97,2119.584,2120.184,I'm June bluster.,89,,
313,0.97,2120.184,2126.491,I'm grateful that the city Council has made it possible for me to participate virtually.,89,,
314,0.97,2126.491,2130.394,Technology at its best can serve democracy.,89,,
315,0.97,2130.394,2141.205,"I don't see no reason why in this technologically forward city, the same cannot be done for the review process.",89,,
316,0.97,2141.205,2150.114,The needs and concerns of local residents to review of construction projects and also solicits public comment.,89,,
317,0.97,2150.114,2160.024,This review is essential to make sure that all stake holders have a voice.,89,,
318,0.97,2160.024,2163.327,To developers and neighborhood residents Arborists and Designers.,89,,
319,0.97,2163.327,2171.202,Protection for neighborhoods and environmentally critical and sensitive areas.,89,,
320,0.97,2171.202,2172.87,The proposal may do more so.,89,,
321,0.97,2172.87,2181.746,If for a brief period review needs to proceed without public comment the design review board should conduct it not Sdci.,89,,
322,0.97,2181.746,2189.42,I understand that building affordable housing and getting people back to work where it's safe to do so are critical priorities.,89,,
323,0.97,2189.42,2215.746,"But it's risky to sacrifice democracy in the name of efficiency without adequate review, market rate housing goes up at a fast pace accelerating displacement and potentially reducing existing affordable housing as Susan has already said . We've seen this happen in Southeast Seattle that continue to our collective health and well being.",89,,
324,0.97,2215.746,2229.193,Please focus your efforts on creating innovative ways to conduct robust design review not on weakening it during the current emergency.,89,,
325,0.97,2229.193,2229.493,Thank you.,89,,
326,0.97,2229.493,2232.83,Our next Speaker is Christine Vohn.,90,,
327,0.97,2232.83,2238.369,I am Christine Vohn speaking to Cb11769.,91,,
328,0.97,2238.369,2244.775,I'm not representing an official position at the Pike place market historical Commission.,91,,
329,0.97,2244.775,2247.078,I'm speaking as my perspective as chair.,91,,
330,0.97,2247.078,2252.516,On this field please limit the application to Seattle's housing crisis.,91,,
331,0.97,2252.516,2257.355,Plea remove any administrative decisions that do not directly impact housing.,91,,
332,0.97,2257.355,2264.629,One of the Rationals is to take away the responsibility of volunteer boards and commissions during this stressful time.,91,,
333,0.97,2264.629,2268.633,To my knowledge no board or Commission has been consulted about this.,91,,
334,0.97,2268.633,2272.803,Or about our willingness to continue to serve with Online meetings.,91,,
335,0.97,2272.803,2276.807,It has been said that it will be difficult to train so many volunteers.,91,,
336,0.97,2276.807,2279.644,Yet people have quickly learned to participate in Online meetings.,91,,
337,0.97,2279.644,2283.214,Even people who have never used this technology before.,91,,
338,0.97,2283.214,2300.264,"It seems to me that in a city that values citizen participation, encouraging participation means facilitating the boards and commissions and our meetings that provide people's input about developments happening in their city.",91,,
339,0.97,2300.264,2319.016,Wanting citizen participation also means respecting the citizen's choice in voting for the save the market initiative that set up a citizen's historical Commission with regulatory authority to protect the character of the Pike place market.,91,,
340,0.97,2319.016,2322.353,This bill is primarily intended to address a housing crisis.,91,,
341,0.97,2322.353,2328.926,Please do only that which is required to keep affordable housing construction on track.,91,,
342,0.97,2328.926,2343.24,Don't dismantle even for a short time the operations of board and Commission into the character of their neighborhoods as long -Z as there's a Quorum please let us continue to do our work.,91,,
343,0.97,2343.24,2353.684,Thank you for your time.,91,,
344,0.97,2359.156,2362.026,Our next Speaker is Bradley Cory.,92,,
345,0.97,2362.026,2388.319,Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak today my name is Bradley Cory and I'm a practicing architect.,93,,
346,0.97,2388.319,2394.125,It does not have the meaning associated with the design review process that everyone is Referencing.,93,,
347,0.97,2394.125,2400.364,There are still opportunities for public to comment at early design guidance.,93,,
348,0.97,2400.364,2404.301,Last year's permit submission and design recommendation.,93,,
349,0.97,2404.301,2410.007,Has it been noted multiple times in the call this is an extremely challenging time.,93,,
350,0.97,2410.007,2419.784,"And I'm concerned that throughout this bill, many of us are going to be sitting and waiting because we cannot get to these meetings.",93,,
351,0.97,2419.784,2439.603,Incredibly important I think at this time is to understand that we're talking about a finite period and to not disadvantage projects that are already in the process so that any project that is currently in design review can proceed with the results of the determination made here.,93,,
352,0.97,2439.603,2452.016,We need to encourage the production of housing and not further slow it down by requiring this process to wait until it's figured out.,93,,
353,0.97,2452.016,2452.583,Thank you.,93,,
354,0.97,2452.583,2453.784,Thank you.,94,,

357,0.97,2462.927,2466.363,We have about nine more speakers.,94,,
358,0.97,2466.363,2468.499,So that's close to 20 more minutes.,94,,
359,0.97,2468.499,2475.94,"So if there's no objection, I would like to extend public comment by 20 minutes.",94,,
360,0.97,2475.94,2477.541,Hearing no objection.,94,,
361,0.97,2477.541,2485.115,We will extend public comment by 20 minutes to conclude with the list.,94,,
362,0.97,2485.115,2491.255,So the next Speaker is Pauline Maclire.,94,,
363,0.97,2491.255,2499.463,"Thank you Council President, and city council this is Pauline Maclire and I'm speaking on Cb679.",95,,
364,0.97,2499.463,2501.832,It's an exciting week for Seattle.,95,,
365,0.97,2501.832,2506.503,"3,000 people participated in the West Seattle Bridgetown hall and that was exciting.",95,,
366,0.97,2506.503,2516.547,"It was well publicized, easy to use and also the public comment -B line for city Council has worked just Greet., just great.",95,,
367,0.97,2516.547,2525.923,But this has seen very little outreach for the city and Council as well.,95,,
368,0.97,2525.923,2529.46,We're Commenting on cities buildings especially Mha.,95,,
369,0.97,2529.46,2535.232,Those projects were granted favorable height bulk and scale.,95,,
370,0.97,2535.232,2544.141,It's a top priority for this city already for the Department of construction inspections to review Mha housing.,95,,
371,0.97,2544.141,2550.047,"And that design review ensures adequate floor space, light, trees and vegetation.",95,,
372,0.97,2550.047,2552.816,Sidewalks and Walkable access to Traápb sit.,95,,
373,0.97,2552.816,2553.25,", transit.",95,,
374,0.97,2553.25,2559.023,We have to get those cars off the road so that's a way to do it.,95,,
375,0.97,2559.023,2571.535,The lack of design review and taking that out of the process will go into displacement of folks.,95,,
376,0.97,2571.535,2576.407,Design reviews on the preservation and made better by the public participation.,95,,
377,0.97,2576.407,2594.458,"And after sitting through the comments last week, it was abundantly clear that many of the folks who commented ahead of financial benefit to see this bill go over the finish line so they can get their projects which were not so urgent right into the public process of avoiding it for a year.",95,,
378,0.97,2594.458,2598.262,Without Council members Herbold's amendment to shorten this scope and the term of the bill it just doesn't work.,95,,
379,0.97,2598.262,2610.341,It's not an emergency under the governor's bill to protect public health from Covid-19 and it's Max of a back room deal to eliminate the who process.,95,,
380,0.97,2610.341,2612.376,Please vote no and retain public participation.,95,,
381,0.97,2612.376,2612.776,Thanks so much.,95,,

389,0.97,2643.474,2659.623,"And Secondly, as you consider this legislation, please keep in mind the race and social justice principals of listening to and getting input of communities of color.",97,,
390,0.97,2659.623,2677.207,"And finally, on behalf of China town and Japan town, I invite all of you to come visit so you could hear firsthand the perspectives of residents, businesses, property owners and other community members.",97,,

392,0.97,2685.716,2686.016,Thank you.,97,,

396,0.97,2694.958,2699.263,Good afternoon Council.,99,,
397,0.97,2699.263,2716.18,"My name is Andrew Houston architect of color, I'm speaking today in support of Cb119769 and specifically want to speak in support of exempting publicly housing from the administrative design review.",99,,
398,0.97,2716.18,2724.321,I know this was a concern last week because currently the system allows for these Logics to go through administrative design review.,99,,
399,0.97,2724.321,2740.637,However from my understanding having collaborated with a number of other architects who go through this process it seems the process for administrative design review can be just as long if not longer than a full design Úreview.,99,,
400,0.97,2740.637,2752.583,Because of the concern both outside of this crisis as well as during it I think it's important to exempt this and Prioritize affordable housing and publicly funded houses for those who need it most.,99,,
401,0.97,2752.583,2762.659,Lastly I want to acknowledge the fact that even though we're starting to preserve a system that has been since it was constructed in 1994.,99,,
402,0.97,2762.659,2784.281,I think one of the larger Legislations and how we shift the development of the necessary housing that we need from being solely focused from the South end of Seattle to expand across the entirety of the city.,99,,
403,0.97,2784.281,2784.581,Thank you.,99,,
404,0.97,2784.581,2787.184,Thank you for calling in today.,100,,
405,0.97,2787.184,2795.459,Our next Speaker is going to be Ana Bonilla.,100,,
406,0.97,2795.459,2802.032,"Good afternoon, my name is Ana Bonilla.",101,,
407,0.97,2802.032,2816.813,I'm here Testifying on behalf of the office and I will try to keep my remarks brief.,101,,
408,0.97,2816.813,2822.886,We're collectively going through a crisis for many weeks to come.,101,,
409,0.97,2822.886,2828.926,Our housing has been facing challenges and other the years it's continued to grow.,101,,
410,0.97,2828.926,2841.538,At a time we've asked people to shelter in place we've exposed the families in the most vulnerable communities do not have safe and affordable placing to shelter in.,101,,
411,0.97,2841.538,2849.613,"Now more than ever, we cannot meet the scale of these extraordinary times we are living in.",101,,
412,0.97,2849.613,2852.382,And we support a six month time frame in which to do so.,101,,
413,0.97,2852.382,2865.596,Our Recoveryis not a switch that will turn on and off it will require deliberate and methodical steps to do so and that means that it takes time.,101,,
414,0.97,2865.596,2870.367,And we also support already in the pipeline.,101,,
415,0.97,2870.367,2874.738,In this case we have housing that will serve homeless youth.,101,,
416,0.97,2874.738,2890.954,Moving forward for engagement and even these virtual ones we've marginalized due to their most likely inability to participate in these new channels we're engaging in.,101,,
417,0.97,2890.954,2893.924,We thank the leadership for bringing this forward.,101,,
418,0.97,2893.924,2899.229,Thank you for calling in today.,102,,
419,0.97,2899.229,2920.384,Our next Speaker is Martin Westerman.,102,,

423,0.97,2928.492,2929.86,Go ahead.,104,,
424,0.97,2929.86,2930.16,Go for it.,104,,
425,0.97,2930.16,2941.571,"All right, the President of the Seattle green space coalition I'm speaking for the coalition and the partners on Cb119769.",105,,
426,0.97,2941.571,2956.32,I call your attention to comments made by former Dpd director Diane Sugimora who said we're not going to let trees stand in the way of development.,105,,
427,0.97,2956.32,2961.425,We hope that has changed in our experience that has not happened.,105,,
428,0.97,2961.425,2971.201,"In the Emerald city development must be integrated with our natural capital, that's trees, and water areas.",105,,
429,0.97,2971.201,2973.537,It shouldn't be the other way.,105,,
430,0.97,2973.537,2982.245,Sbci cannot generally be trusted to act in the public interest to balance build a natural capital.,105,,
431,0.97,2982.245,2994.725,Give the SBCI more freedom will only accelerate this pattern specifically then and other individuals and nations we work with want to consider these changes to Cb119769.,105,,
432,0.97,2994.725,3000.664,We support amendment one that says affordable housing projects should not be exempted for design review.,105,,
433,0.97,3000.664,3003.867,The current system has not slowed public housing development.,105,,
434,0.97,3003.867,3009.539,So why is there a reason to create these exemptions.,105,,
435,0.97,3009.539,3013.31,Don't fix what hasn't been broken.,105,,
436,0.97,3013.31,3019.85,We support amendment two to support period from two months to six months.,105,,
437,0.97,3019.85,3028.091,So two months should allow more than enough time to move and design.,105,,
438,0.97,3028.091,3035.332,We support Seattle business to be conducted with Online meetings in lieu of the Inperson meetings.,105,,
439,0.97,3035.332,3046.61,We do not support giving waivers for potential landmark building processes and we do not support adding review allowances for SBCI during the exemption period.,105,,
440,0.97,3046.61,3061.458,All developers we believe should follow Seattle's land use code.,105,,
441,0.97,3061.458,3065.462,The next Speaker is Mary slaughter.,105,,
442,0.97,3065.462,3074.604,Hi this is Mary slaughter and I'm calling in to oppose the bill number 119769.,106,,
443,0.97,3074.604,3089.453,I would like to echo the points made by Susan grant and June Bluespruce and the others who spoke against this bill.,106,,
444,0.97,3089.453,3097.727,And I too agree that SBCI can't be trusted to protect our urban environment.,106,,
445,0.97,3097.727,3111.341,I've seen it in victory heights and District five how lots are cleared and large Unaffordable buildings are put in place with absolutely not one tree preserved.,106,,
446,0.97,3111.341,3124.721,And we absolutely need to pay attention to our urban environment in this time when climate change is so detrimental to our environment here in Seattle.,106,,
447,0.97,3124.721,3130.327,Thank you for those Council members who voted against us last week.,106,,
448,0.97,3130.327,3135.799,I encourage you to hold steady.,106,,
449,0.97,3135.799,3138.034,Thank you very much.,106,,
450,0.97,3138.034,3148.578,Our next Speaker is Naomi C.,107,,
451,0.97,3154.451,3161.725,"Thank you, I'm Naomi I'm speaking in support of Council bill 79.",108,,
452,0.97,3161.725,3176.172,I would like to thank Council for passing legislation that pass a Ordnance to stop the spread of Covid-19 and that is to build affordable housing.,108,,
453,0.97,3176.172,3184.214,The design review process adds thousands of costs per unit.,108,,
454,0.97,3184.214,3197.861,In many cases these projects have already yielded broad community support and are developed by reputable nonprofit organizations who are held to rigorous design standards through their Funders and are committed to quality living environments.,108,,
455,0.97,3197.861,3206.436,We have a long time before we finish dealing with this crisis and in the meantime crisis will be a critical component.,108,,
456,0.97,3206.436,3210.607,Thank you for your time and your support and I hope we can get this one through.,108,,
457,0.97,3210.607,3214.144,I thank you for calling in today.,109,,
458,0.97,3214.144,3218.215,Our next Speaker is Brandon Petite.,109,,
459,0.97,3218.215,3218.515,Hello.,110,,
460,0.97,3218.515,3219.349,Hello can you hear me.,110,,
461,0.97,3219.349,3220.35,We can hear you.,111,,
462,0.97,3220.35,3222.185,Thank you.,112,,
463,0.97,3222.185,3225.889,My name is Brandon petit.,112,,
464,0.97,3225.889,3228.458,I own two restaurants Delancy and tomato pie in Seattle.,112,,
465,0.97,3228.458,3234.631,I wanted to thank you Fies for acting so quickly for capping at party restaurant fees.,112,,
466,0.97,3234.631,3240.036,Restaurants are the second largest employer in the country with 10% of the entire work force.,112,,
467,0.97,3240.036,3246.142,And almost all of them are family owned restaurants with 50 employees or less.,112,,
468,0.97,3246.142,3249.312,Some Statistics say 99% of restaurants are family owned.,112,,
469,0.97,3249.312,3259.623,Not only do we have a huge amount of employees we support but we also have supported an entire supply chain.,112,,
470,0.97,3259.623,3280.343,"The one thing I want to commence is even after this crisis, I would like to find a way to continue capping those at fees because they are incredibly Kpor Exorbitat.",112,,
471,0.97,3300.263,3308.038,It's double dipping and there's tons of articles as well as to how low they pay their contact labor and drivers.,112,,
472,0.97,3308.038,3313.376,They're making huge profits and the sales are up during this crisis.,112,,
473,0.97,3313.376,3314.544,I'm glad we capped it now.,112,,
474,0.97,3314.544,3318.682,But even after this crisis I hope to continue to cap it.,112,,
475,0.97,3318.682,3323.42,Just in one of my small restaurants it uses one App.,112,,
476,0.97,3323.42,3328.158,"One restaurant and one App saves $1,000 of fees per week.",112,,
477,0.97,3328.158,3329.859,This is just a very small.,112,,
478,0.97,3329.859,3344.407,I also want to mention as we're thinking about restaurants that we also for small business owners and employees need to be thinking about rent relief for our restaurants.,112,,
479,0.97,3344.407,3350.28,Thank you for calling in today.,113,,
480,0.97,3350.28,3351.715,Our next Speaker is Ruth Danner.,113,,
481,0.97,3351.715,3372.135,"Thank you my name is Ruth Danner, backed by 90,000 voices of concern for Seattle's future dedicated to preserving Affordability, Sustainability and quality of life for all who live, work and play here.",114,,
482,0.97,3372.135,3373.369,I will address Cb119769.,114,,
483,0.97,3373.369,3376.506,We are drowning victims of our own success.,114,,
484,0.97,3376.506,3388.418,Long before this pandemic the security of affordable Sustainability living has been slipping from the grasp of young and old service workers and Mid-Level professionals alike.,114,,
485,0.97,3388.418,3398.762,Phenomenal growth and prosperity have driven real estate crisis to breathtaking heights to the short term benefit of some but with long range consequences for all.,114,,
486,0.97,3398.762,3413.81,With each new tower the supply of naturally occurring services increases.,114,,
487,0.97,3413.81,3417.414,Mha fees are insufficient to hold back a tide.,114,,
488,0.97,3417.414,3422.418,In a system growth happens naturally.,114,,
489,0.97,3422.418,3425.188,Organically at it own pace.,114,,
490,0.97,3425.188,3437.967,Artificially borrow from the future and inevitably the bill comes to Cb119769 strips this city of protections guaranteed by the growth management act.,114,,
491,0.97,3437.967,3466.496,It is presented in the name of affordable housing but is clearly designed to continue Profiteering for the few while the water that once lapped at our toes now grows to the trees.,114,,
492,0.97,3466.496,3472.735,Shortcuts lead to shabby outcomes that lead to synchronized decline.,114,,
493,0.97,3472.735,3475.538,Adjust now before it is too late.,114,,
494,0.97,3475.538,3476.172,Thank you.,114,,
495,0.97,3476.172,3478.808,Thank you for calling in.,115,,

561,0.97,3740.336,3746.375,That vote only required a majority in other words five Council members present to be in favor.,160,,
562,0.97,3746.375,3756.285,Of moving forward and so that motion carries and Council bill 119769 is now before the Council.,160,,
563,0.97,3756.285,3760.59,Council member Strauss a sponsor of the bill do you have any opening remarks that you would like to make.,160,,
564,0.97,3760.59,3763.993,"Yes, thank you Council President I will try to make this short.",161,,
565,0.97,3763.993,3777.406,"As we've discussed this many times before, this emergency legislation addresses design review historic preservation and permitting process during the Covid-19 emergency.",161,,
566,0.97,3777.406,3790.253,It's temporary in nature and the legislation is to allow critical needed projects to continue moving forward in a way that preserves public input and protects public health.,161,,
567,0.97,3790.253,3800.296,Particularly the legislation would allow projects to opt into administrative design review until boards are able to meet virtually or in person.,161,,
568,0.97,3800.296,3807.97,"It would allow for Preapplication, community outreach to be done virtually and explicitly highlights how that could be done.",161,,
569,0.97,3807.97,3820.416,It would allow for minor decisions related to historic and special review districts while suspending meetings and remarks and special review boards.,161,,
570,0.97,3820.416,3833.429,"Because the legislation is being enacted on an emergency basis, all provisions would lapse after 180 days and we are required to hold the public hearing within 60 days.",161,,
571,0.97,3833.429,3850.713,"More than the time sensitivity around this is more than 20 proposed residential projects representing over 3,500 housing units and in this living facility are currently on hold because design review meetings have been canceled.",161,,
572,0.97,3850.713,3858.754,Another 20 projects have been asked to be delayed four months for the review boards that could Outlast the current emergency.,161,,
573,0.97,3858.754,3866.963,It typically takes a project within a year to move through the design review process so allowing these projects to keep moving is important.,161,,
574,0.97,3866.963,3876.539,Another 30 projects including four affordable housing projects are unable to proceed because they cannot complete their early community hours until this legislation is passed.,161,,
575,0.97,3876.539,3882.511,There's also a minor landmark's recommendation with the key arena and has been delayed for several weeks.,161,,
576,0.97,3882.511,3886.282,This will become a pinch point in May.,161,,
577,0.97,3886.282,3895.558,While departments have been taken steps to hold design review board meetings virtually there are several barriers that still need to be addressed.,161,,
578,0.97,3895.558,3909.138,"I share with you this is different than the Council meetings, Commission meetings because there is feed back and conversations that needed on detailed documents and that can be confusing.",161,,
579,0.97,3909.138,3914.677,"Even last week, I personally experienced not speaking for any other Council member's experience.",161,,
580,0.97,3914.677,3918.881,I was kicked off our virtual meetings here at the city council twice.,161,,
581,0.97,3918.881,3926.289,We have only been able to start our public input last week.,161,,
582,0.97,3926.289,3933.262,"And this is just, this doesn't even begin to cover the complex level of design review.",161,,
583,0.97,3933.262,3951.681,The size of the design review program which involves 20 to 30 meetings each month Council member Liz I did confirm it's over 100 staff members who would need additional training and 70 volunteer board members with varying abilities and technological aspects.,161,,
584,0.97,3951.681,3961.891,There are also challenges with facilitating comments and signing for these complex and technical Graphics that are graphic rich in their presentation.,161,,
585,0.97,3961.891,3981.143,We're all able to be together on this call today because it's our job and the design review process relies on volunteers dealing with all the challenges of the pandemic which changes the availability for frequent meetings and doesn't guarantee that full participation is able to occur.,161,,
586,0.97,3981.143,3986.949,The design Commission has as I said been able to hold a virtual meeting Khr is promising.,161,,
587,0.97,3986.949,3991.854,This this is different than design board.,161,,
588,0.97,3991.854,4007.37,One of the members would require reporting 60 days these virtual meetings and the legislation is written to virtually mirror the public engagement opportunity that community members would have if we were using the typical process.,161,,
589,0.97,4007.37,4021.684,"I will just as a final note, go over the amendments that we made last week that would allow projects to receive the recommendation through administrative design review process.",161,,
590,0.97,4021.684,4039.268,To remain in that process allow Self-Nominated projects seeking landmark legislation for incentive agreements not the final designation allow Seattle housing authority to review for affording housing.,161,,
591,0.97,4039.268,4047.476,Improving tree protections by removing any exemption that would allow for hazardous tree removal that would be done so administratively.,161,,
592,0.97,4047.476,4061.49,Allow another amendment to allow for administrative during window replacements and special review districts and allow for administrative approval when those guidelines already exist.,161,,
593,0.97,4061.49,4068.03,I will leave it at that because we have had extensive conversation on this bill.,161,,
594,0.97,4068.03,4076.772,Ill would like to compliment Council member Lewis for his community outreach on his amendment.,161,,
595,0.97,4076.772,4077.773,So thank you.,161,,
596,0.97,4077.773,4083.412,"Thank you, council member Strauss for those introductory remarks.",162,,
597,0.97,4083.412,4090.786,I know that we have two amendments to manage as we discussed during Council briefing this morning.,162,,
598,0.97,4090.786,4099.028,So I'm going to go through the amendments at this point in order that they appear on the published agenda.,162,,
599,0.97,4099.028,4105.201,That means that Council member Morales will be up first of all with Council member Lewis on his amendment.,162,,
600,0.97,4105.201,4113.742,I'm going to hand it to Council member Morales so she can make her motion to have us consider amendment one.,162,,
601,0.97,4113.742,4115.177,Council member Morales the floor is yours.,162,,
602,0.97,4115.177,4127.122,"Thank you, I move to amend Council bill 119769 a presented on the Morales bill one.",163,,
603,0.97,4127.122,4127.423,Second.,164,,
604,0.97,4127.423,4136.432,It has been moved and Seconded to amend the bill Council member Morales it will send it to you to Adder the amendment.,165,,
605,0.97,4136.432,4146.008,"This amendment would allow the director of neighborhoods to approve certificates of Apraoáfl for, approval for some review district.",166,,
606,0.97,4146.008,4154.75,It would also remove a provision that would have allowed for virtual meetings of the Isrd board in lieu of in person meetings.,166,,
607,0.97,4154.75,4166.695,"If in person meetings can be held safely, meetings would not be held for 60 days and the amendment also corrects some drafting errors that were in the version that we have last week.",166,,
608,0.97,4166.695,4182.444,"The purpose of this really is as I said this morning in briefing two allow meetings to continue once we have, once we're able to meet in person again safely.",166,,
609,0.97,4182.444,4192.488,But not meet virtually and the real point here is to protect the community that doesn't have a lot of access to technology.,166,,
610,0.97,4192.488,4214.944,And where we can't always have assurance that they will have sufficient language interpretation services available for some of these technical conversations and so the community is willing to just wait and gather again in when it's safe to do so.,166,,
611,0.97,4214.944,4216.579,After the 60 day period.,166,,
612,0.97,4216.579,4219.148,Thank you.,167,,
613,0.97,4219.148,4224.853,Council member Morales for addressing the amendment.,167,,
614,0.97,4224.853,4231.56,Are there any other comments on this amendment?,167,,
615,0.97,4231.56,4232.962,Council member Herbold.,167,,
616,0.97,4232.962,4237.733,Can you for my benefit explain why this amendment is different than the one you brought forward last week.,168,,
617,0.97,4237.733,4248.41,The reason I'm asking is the guidance received from the clerk's office is for if an amendment fails in order for all of us to bring it back it has to be a different question.,168,,
618,0.97,4248.41,4256.085,So I would just really appreciate the clarity of understanding how this amendment differs from the one you brought last week.,168,,
619,0.97,4256.085,4263.525,So what happened last week was that there was some drafting errors like I said.,169,,
620,0.97,4263.525,4270.499,The intention is to eliminate the option for electronic meetings.,169,,
621,0.97,4270.499,4290.919,"But what was actually incorporated into the language from last week would have, would have allowed for the certificate of approval process, administrative process to continue for the Pioneer square review district but not for the International district special review district.",169,,
622,0.97,4290.919,4301.23,So part of the challenge was that there was just a drafting error that needed to be removed from what we were trying to accomplish.,169,,
623,0.97,4301.23,4315.144,"So not, I am trying to provide an opportunity for you to say, that this, the effect of this amendment is different than the amendment that you brought forward.",170,,
624,0.97,4315.144,4316.879,Would that be an accurate statement.,170,,
625,0.97,4316.879,4329.358,The effect of the previous amendment was much broader had a much broader scope of that it would have changed the ability of the Sird.,171,,
626,0.97,4329.358,4339.501,This is narrowing the scope of what had been proposed what had been included in the motion.,171,,
627,0.97,4339.501,4340.035,Thank you.,172,,
628,0.97,4340.035,4343.472,Thank you for that line of questioning.,173,,
629,0.97,4343.472,4355.517,Are there any other comments on the Morales amendment one.,173,,
630,0.97,4355.517,4357.453,Hearing none.,173,,
631,0.97,4357.453,4361.49,Council member Mosqueda did I see your hand going up?,173,,
632,0.97,4361.49,4371.834,I just want to say that thank you to Council member morale s for this amendment.,174,,

655,0.97,4423.018,4430.926,So I'm going to hand it to you Council member Lewis to put amendment two on the table.,194,,
656,0.97,4430.926,4435.43,Thank you Ma'am President.,195,,
657,0.97,4435.43,4442.704,I move to amend Council bill 119769 as presented on version two of the Lewis amendment II on the agenda.,195,,
658,0.97,4442.704,4443.172,Second.,196,,
659,0.97,4443.172,4446.575,It's been moved and Seconded to amend the bill.,197,,
660,0.97,4446.575,4451.48,Council member Lewis I'm going to hand it back over to you so you can address your amendment.,197,,
661,0.97,4451.48,4453.081,"Well, I will just be brief.",198,,
662,0.97,4453.081,4462.291,"I think we had a goodies, good discussion on the briefing this morning.",198,,
663,0.97,4462.291,4469.264,Just to reiterate some of the items that were brought up.,198,,
664,0.97,4469.264,4486.715,"That the buildings that were going forward under this pilot program, are of a particular size involved the design review is more important than for similarly situated projects that are not part of the living building pilot program.",198,,
665,0.97,4486.715,4492.855,I think too that given the status of the three projects that this amendment would address.,198,,
666,0.97,4492.855,4517.913,All of which are midstream through the accomplished review process that it would be warranted for these projects to continue along in that path and go back to the design review boards be it in person or virtual to get the final go ahead to proceed to the master use permit for those reasons I think that this amendment at this time is appropriate.,198,,
667,0.97,4517.913,4520.616,It's nearly tailored.,198,,
668,0.97,4520.616,4537.699,"It speaks to particular articulate reasons on why exceptions like these would be warranted, given the scope of the current Ordnance and I would ask that the Council approve this amendment.",198,,
669,0.97,4537.699,4541.136,Thank you Council member Lewis.,199,,
670,0.97,4541.136,4549.244,Are there any comments on Council member Lewis's amendment.,199,,
671,0.97,4549.244,4551.213,Council member Mosqueda the floor is yours.,200,,
672,0.97,4551.213,4556.818,I will defer to the prime sponsor I'm sorry.,201,,
673,0.97,4556.818,4561.156,Again just want to compliment Council member Lewis on his outrage.,202,,
674,0.97,4561.156,4576.305,This is a very type of outreach amendment that I appreciate in engaging.,202,,
675,0.97,4576.305,4587.316,We want to get it across the finish line so just want all of Council member Lewis's constituents to know that he is doing work in their stead.,202,,
676,0.97,4587.316,4597.326,I appreciate it despite my desire to really not engage in New topics on this bill since it has been such a heavy bill so far.,202,,
677,0.97,4597.326,4600.228,"Thank you, you are recognized the floor is yours.",203,,
678,0.97,4600.228,4615.444,Thank you very much Ma'am president and I do appreciate th hard work that has gone into this legislation both from the prime sponsor and those who have been drafting amendments.,204,,
679,0.97,4615.444,4626.154,In the time of Covid and making sure that our community constituents engagement processes don't Miss a beat and you all have been exemplary in this action.,204,,
680,0.97,4626.154,4636.498,I do need to speak out with my concerns about this amendment and offer first a piece of clarification and second my rational for not voting for this amendment.,204,,
681,0.97,4636.498,4650.612,First I think it's really important that I make sure that folks know that there's been a Misperception about community engagement administrative design review mirrors the public review process that takes place during the full design review.,204,,
682,0.97,4650.612,4661.99,It simply replaces the in comment period with a call in comment period.,204,,
683,0.97,4661.99,4670.265,All steps in the administrative review process are hopefully posted through the Website.,204,,
684,0.97,4670.265,4678.807,"You received Notifications on all materials submitted, planners, comments and recommendations similar to full design review.",204,,
685,0.97,4678.807,4688.884,"I would also posture as I said in last week's conversation, it's Arguably more inclusive to be able to accept phone calls and written comments than just having meetings in person.",204,,
686,0.97,4688.884,4693.021,Think about all the folks who are working two and three jobs.,204,,
687,0.97,4693.021,4701.563,The people who would like to be there but they have responsibilities at home or at work or mobility issues.,204,,
688,0.97,4701.563,4712.774,We want to make sure we're thinking of Inclusivety and equity as we think about soliciting comment especially now during Covid.,204,,
689,0.97,4712.774,4732.027,"Secly, Secondly the reason that I'm speaking, I think the outstanding projects we would like to see be able to get the design review process moving forward and get the green light to move forward so that we don't lose any interest in the abilities to build these exact types of buildings.",204,,
690,0.97,4732.027,4736.198,These are socially just Sustainability human health oriented green buildings.,204,,
691,0.97,4736.198,4753.582,As we talked about this morning this is not just about set backs or green roofs it's about incorporating the building design and materials and the energy systems to create spaces that integrate the physical and psychological well being of people and the health of the surrounding environment.,204,,
692,0.97,4753.582,4758.687,We think it's really important that we think about how we encourage more developers to go this rout.,204,,
693,0.97,4758.687,4766.294,This pilot is extremely important as we think about reducing the amount of energy used.,204,,
694,0.97,4766.294,4773.068,Creating green spaces and really facilitating that integration between community preference and what we would like to see in these buildings.,204,,
695,0.97,4773.068,4777.272,"If we, I think the unintended consequences here.",204,,
696,0.97,4777.272,4791.219,If you pull out living buildings is those who are interested in living buildings will opt for the administrative design review and we missed more opportunity to see these green buildings come into fruition.,204,,
697,0.97,4791.219,4802.097,I worry about the message we send to folks that might be considering future buildings that we don't want to go down this rout either.,204,,
698,0.97,4802.097,4804.432,I'm appreciative of the conversation.,204,,
699,0.97,4804.432,4814.776,It's important for us to push back to say that living buildings projects like these are exactly what we would like to see to make sure we incorporate the public feed back.,204,,
700,0.97,4814.776,4842.971,Work with Sdci to ensure that that public comment is integrated as we move forward and make sure for the environments sake that we are encouraging facilitating and creating more opportunities for living building projects to move forward especially in this time that we worry that Covid directors could pull out of projects like this as uncertain economic forecasts cause people to question future investments.,204,,
701,0.97,4842.971,4843.438,Let's move forward.,204,,
702,0.97,4843.438,4854.416,Let's include living buildings and our efforts and let's remember this will absolutely allow for community investment to continue as outlined by our Department partners in previous presentations.,204,,
703,0.97,4854.416,4866.795,Thank you for letting me explain my position on this and for the ongoing colleagues to make sure the public comment is included and that we hopefully include living buildings as well.,204,,
704,0.97,4866.795,4868.897,Thank you Council member Mosqueda.,205,,
705,0.97,4868.897,4872.1,Are there any other comments.,205,,
706,0.97,4872.1,4878.173,I see you Council Herbold the floor is yours.,205,,
707,0.97,4878.173,4918.38,"We have sponsor Lewis, it's been said there's a concern for buildings that have been, have submitted their permit applications as living buildings that if we pass an amendment today that had those buildings that had already submitted their permits as a living building and were already in the design review process, that they would then that that might somehow be a damper might have a chilling effect on either those particular buildings or future buildings.",206,,
708,0.97,4918.38,4927.989,All I want is to clarify that this is only for buildings that have already filed their permits and already have a design review track.,206,,
709,0.97,4927.989,4930.158,This is not for future living buildings.,206,,
710,0.97,4930.158,4938.733,This is only for the ones that are currently on track.,206,,
711,0.97,4938.733,4958.42,"And I think, I am speculating that the cost associated with Redesigning one of those buildings to not be subject to the same design review track as they are before passage of this legislation would be pretty extensive.",206,,
712,0.97,4958.42,4966.127,I am just giving you another chance to defend your amendment or correct me if I'm wrong.,206,,
713,0.97,4966.127,4977.205,I also want to reference the point of the bill sponsor Council member Strauss for the purposes of ..,206,,
714,0.97,4977.205,4981.576,"We all know what the rules are, for purposes of the viewing public.",206,,
715,0.97,4981.576,5003.865,"I just want to clarify that we don't require the consent of bill sponsors in order to bring forward amendments during full council everyone during this very, in this very stressful time of trying to hear legislation, not in committee but only in full council.",206,,
716,0.97,5003.865,5021.916,We're working on a compressed time period and I believe Council member Strauss was only referring to his preference to not allow.,206,,
717,0.97,5021.916,5022.217,Thank you.,206,,
718,0.97,5022.217,5043.371,So I think there was the question in there for Council member Lewis that I will let him field in terms of the procedure and Council rules I'll address that since I am the Presiding officer if you will on these meetings.,207,,
719,0.97,5043.371,5044.672,You are correct.,207,,
720,0.97,5044.672,5049.21,"Council member Herbold that, so long as Council rules are followed.",207,,
721,0.97,5049.21,5055.45,Amendments can be brought forward by any of us as individually elected Council members.,207,,
722,0.97,5055.45,5067.395,I took Council member Strauss comments as being a preference that that not occur given that he is the prime sponsor of this Council bill and that is pretty ordinary.,207,,
723,0.97,5067.395,5094.656,Many of us on many occasions have Messaged that or signaled that in the course of advancing our legislation that we're not supporting a particular amendment because of feeling that it's untimely or opens up potential new issues that could compromise the need to pass a bill on a particular time line.,207,,
724,0.97,5094.656,5100.295,I think you're absolutely correct in your observation that it's not a rule that new issues not be brought up.,207,,
725,0.97,5100.295,5106.501,"But I do, I do sort of want to agree with that.",207,,
726,0.97,5106.501,5107.101,That perspective.,207,,
727,0.97,5107.101,5120.415,And with sort of my understanding of Council member Strauss plea which is let's minimize the issues we're considering here given that this is our second go around on this.,207,,
728,0.97,5120.415,5126.187,And I certainly respect his encouragement for us to expedite this.,207,,
729,0.97,5126.187,5132.527,Council member Lewis would you like to address the question that was posed to you.,207,,
730,0.97,5132.527,5139.067,And I did see Council member Strauss raise his hand.,207,,
731,0.97,5139.067,5142.47,"I think it's an open question, I think they are well taken.",208,,
732,0.97,5142.47,5150.178,And I'm glad that she did raise it.,208,,
733,0.97,5150.178,5155.617,As to whether any kind of legislating around this pilot program could be a freezing address or deterrent address.,208,,
734,0.97,5155.617,5160.121,I think that's certainly something that is credible to bring up and incredible to raise.,208,,
735,0.97,5160.121,5170.632,I would say that the way the amendment is drafted it would also only for the entire history of the amendment.,208,,
736,0.97,5170.632,5181.409,Any subsequent project that did come in as Council member Herbold commented on would be put into the track.,208,,
737,0.97,5181.409,5188.249,It would be projects that have already engaged and had a design meeting and are sort of locked.,208,,
738,0.97,5188.249,5190.919,This amendment would lock those three projects in.,208,,
739,0.97,5190.919,5196.357,Of the three live in projects only three would be affected.,208,,
740,0.97,5196.357,5205.633,"No subsequent living project, they would be able to take advantage of the administrative track that the Ordnance provide.",208,,
741,0.97,5205.633,5210.572,I think it's certainly fair and appreciated.,208,,
742,0.97,5210.572,5228.456,I would also add that the be it procedural or not I do appreciate Council member Strauss indulgence in letting this be aired so I want to thank them for that and that can even be my closing comments to on the amendment.,208,,
743,0.97,5228.456,5241.002,After Council member Strauss if you would come to back to me I would rest with that and lever it there and leave it there.,208,,
744,0.97,5241.002,5259.12,"Council member Strauss, I think we had this long of debate on the amendment is probably proving Council members Strauss point around not wanting to introduce last minute issues into an already kind of complex bill.",209,,
745,0.97,5259.12,5265.193,But Council member Strauss I will send it to you.,209,,
746,0.97,5265.193,5271.432,I really just want to say thank you to Council member Lewis for bringing this process forward.,210,,
747,0.97,5271.432,5272.8,I will end it with that.,210,,
748,0.97,5272.8,5279.04,Thank you Council member Lewis.,210,,
749,0.97,5279.04,5281.142,Good work.,210,,
750,0.97,5281.142,5301.262,"All right, Okay, council member Mosqueda I want you to comment again and then we will vote on.",211,,
751,0.97,5301.262,5306.901,Thank you so much I know you understand where I'm coming from Council member Lewis.,212,,
752,0.97,5306.901,5316.744,I appreciate the ongoing work that you're doing to try to elevate the issue of how folks continue to stay engaged Amidthese conversations.,212,,
753,0.97,5316.744,5321.049,I think that it does bare sort of me under scoring.,212,,
754,0.97,5321.049,5325.787,I think that we have a difference of opinion though and perhaps I'm reading it wrong.,212,,
755,0.97,5325.787,5335.63,But my read is that projects in the future would not be able to opt into participating in living buildings later in the permitting process if this amendment is in place.,212,,
756,0.97,5335.63,5337.899,I am not sure I'm reading it the same way.,212,,
757,0.97,5337.899,5347.075,I'm hopeful that the amendment doesn't hang and we can continue to look into this question and have a conversation about the importance of living buildings in the future.,212,,
758,0.97,5347.075,5354.916,But I worry that if projects decide to opt into living buildings after they go through an early review guidance.,212,,
759,0.97,5354.916,5358.786,That's where my concern is coming from.,212,,
760,0.97,5358.786,5363.958,I don't want to sort of Belabor the point anymore because I know you're about to call the question.,212,,
761,0.97,5363.958,5368.329,But I think that just precisely because this E question is out there and I have a different read of it.,212,,
762,0.97,5368.329,5373.701,I wanted to under score my concern about the language as is.,212,,
763,0.97,5373.701,5380.141,I won't repeat myself.,212,,
764,0.97,5380.141,5388.282,"Council Memberly, member Lewis I just want you to be clear of where my concerns are.",212,,
765,0.97,5388.282,5392.32,"Council member Lewis, I know you're the sponsor.",213,,
766,0.97,5392.32,5397.658,I wanted to make sure you had the opportunity to have the last word if you need to have it.,213,,
767,0.97,5397.658,5402.63,I will stand with my previous commitment to rest where I did.,214,,
768,0.97,5402.63,5404.532,That's what I like to hear.,215,,
769,0.97,5404.532,5410.738,I'm going to close out discussion on the Lewis amendment II.,215,,
770,0.97,5410.738,5426.487,And ask that the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of version two of the the Lewis amendment.,215,,

791,0.97,5465.626,5486.914,"Are there any further comments on the bill as amended and colleagues, this is going to be a vote on the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to make, we're going to vote on the passage of the bill as amended today and last Monday.",235,,
792,0.97,5486.914,5492.019,Are there any comments on the bill as amended.,235,,
793,0.97,5492.019,5500.061,I saw Council member Lewis first and Council member Pederson and Council member Morales.,235,,
794,0.97,5500.061,5503.264,I'm going to be really brief.,236,,
795,0.97,5503.264,5505.533,I intend to vote on this today like I did last week.,236,,
796,0.97,5505.533,5510.271,I do want to flag just a couple of things.,236,,
797,0.97,5510.271,5517.044,First I continue to implore Sdci to develop a way to conduct these meetings Online sooner rather than later.,236,,
798,0.97,5517.044,5529.79,You know I actually if there's any Council members here that's Privy to more information since Sdci has had an additional week to plan and prepare for that.,236,,
799,0.97,5529.79,5532.827,If anyone could provide that information it would be great.,236,,
800,0.97,5532.827,5535.73,"Because I do think that, that it is critical.",236,,
801,0.97,5535.73,5538.833,It's really the under relying issue here.,236,,
802,0.97,5538.833,5554.315,There wouldn't even be any debate and this wouldn't be a contentious issue if we could see a plan of action or see some more public effort on the part of Sdci to stand up the meeting.,236,,
803,0.97,5554.315,5557.218,I would urge the Department to do that.,236,,
804,0.97,5557.218,5558.419,Sooner rather than later.,236,,
805,0.97,5558.419,5568.93,"The second thing I would say is I have talked to Sdci and I know a number of folks in my district commented today, have been sending me E-Mails, have been reaching out.",236,,
806,0.97,5568.93,5572.199,Some talking about particular and specific projects.,236,,
807,0.97,5572.199,5589.183,Folks at Sdci have told me that they're happy to work with my office to make sure people concerned about particular projects can get in touch that their input can be taken in as Council member Mosqueda entered earlier on the administrative process.,236,,
808,0.97,5589.183,5592.72,I just want to flag if there's folks.,236,,
809,0.97,5592.72,5600.127,"They're still listening, contact my office and I'll make sure that you are put in touch with Sdci so you can engage in the administrative process.",236,,
810,0.97,5600.127,5605.433,And those are the only comments that I wanted to make before voting on this.,236,,
811,0.97,5605.433,5609.17,Thank you Council member Lewis for those remarks.,237,,
812,0.97,5609.17,5616.777,I am now going to move over to Council member Pederson who's next in the Cue.,237,,
813,0.97,5616.777,5618.045,The floor is yours.,237,,
814,0.97,5618.045,5630.257,I would like to thank Council President Gonzalez and Council member Strauss for providing us another week to review this Council bill 119769.,238,,
815,0.97,5630.257,5635.496,I would also like to thank the many constituents who have written with their views on the legislation.,238,,
816,0.97,5635.496,5645.74,"Whether they are for or against this Council bill they clearly Úcare about land use policies, real estate projects, they're neighborhoods and our city.",238,,
817,0.97,5645.74,5650.878,I also appreciate the various amendments from my Council colleagues to try to make this legislation better.,238,,
818,0.97,5650.878,5660.821,"To be consistent with my vote last week, and based on my many years of experience in the field of commercial real estate finance, I would be voting no again.",238,,
819,0.97,5660.821,5665.159,Because I don't think it meets the requirements of an emergency.,238,,
820,0.97,5665.159,5671.432,And I'm concerned that reduces input and discussion from the general public.,238,,
821,0.97,5671.432,5672.5,Thank you.,238,,
822,0.97,5672.5,5674.101,Thank you Council member Pederson.,239,,
823,0.97,5674.101,5682.009,"We're not going to hear from Council member Morales, we're now going to hear from Council member Morales the floor is yours.",239,,
824,0.97,5682.009,5684.045,Thank you everyone for this long discussion.,240,,
825,0.97,5684.045,5692.486,I want to thank Council member Strauss for working with my office in the last week.,240,,
826,0.97,5692.486,5699.16,We've heard lots of concerns for neighbors so I appreciate your willingness to collaborate with us.,240,,
827,0.97,5699.16,5712.84,"I will say I do intend to support this bill and I stand Conflicted in this as I said last week, I do think that this bill can inflate some issues with lots of other issues.",240,,
828,0.97,5712.84,5719.213,It moves construction forward and we might think that that is generally a good thing.,240,,
829,0.97,5719.213,5730.157,But the only way to address the affordable housing issue is to Prioritize housing.,240,,
830,0.97,5730.157,5769.497,"This bill seems to be as it relates to the China town district the overwhelming majority of projects there are hotel and Quicking the process for the lack of timing, rarely a benefit for the communities I represent.",240,,
831,0.97,5769.497,5774.068,What's seen as efficient for governments or developers often means inequity for my community.,240,,
832,0.97,5774.068,5788.149,I do plan to vote yes today and this will be my first and last con concession in the name of easing process or relieving administrative burdens especially if it means it will accelerate disaster Gentrification.,240,,
833,0.97,5788.149,5793.22,It's my responsibility to vote in a way that benefits my community.,240,,
834,0.97,5793.22,5798.492,Sometimes that means slowing down the process to ensure that their voices are heard.,240,,
835,0.97,5798.492,5801.929,But don't mistake that for naive or confusion.,240,,
836,0.97,5801.929,5805.699,That's about ensuring that those voices have access to power.,240,,
837,0.97,5805.699,5823.651,I know that we all want to see affordable housing built and we're going to have regular discussions about how to make that happen and I know that if our plans for Postcovid life mean going back to business as usual we will have done this wrong.,240,,
838,0.97,5823.651,5833.627,I look forward to continuing conversations with all of you to make sure that the conversation is just and equitable and that we work together to make sure that happens.,240,,
839,0.97,5833.627,5836.897,Thank you so much Council member Morales.,241,,
840,0.97,5836.897,5849.109,"I know that we have other Council members who might want to make comment on a bill before, I'm going to give Council member Strauss the final word.",241,,
841,0.97,5849.109,5852.947,But I just saw Council Herbold race her hand.,241,,
842,0.97,5852.947,5853.814,The floor is yours.,241,,
843,0.97,5853.814,5854.481,Thank you.,242,,
844,0.97,5854.481,5867.595,As I hope I have expressed I'm generally supportive of this legislation accepting the concern as I've expressed last with the section of the bill that Exempts affordable housing from all design review.,242,,
845,0.97,5867.595,5883.41,I believe this section of the law is in conflict relating to adherence of the hearings Act and state Attorney General's guidance on that proclamation.,242,,
846,0.97,5883.41,5897.157,This guidance must be a matter that is either necessary and routine or necessary to respond to the Covid-19 outbreak and current public health emergency.,242,,
847,0.97,5897.157,5901.829,My amendment failed last week had it passed I would have it support this bill.,242,,
848,0.97,5901.829,5905.165,I cannot make a motion for reconsideration of this amendment.,242,,
849,0.97,5905.165,5909.503,Because if I wanted to find a way to support the bill.,242,,
850,0.97,5909.503,5915.009,I consider altering the amendment substantially enough so I can bring forth another version of my amendment.,242,,
851,0.97,5915.009,5939.533,"But I was unable to find a substantial enough edit that would fulfill our counsel sill, council rules that substantially new question while also accomplishing my goal of removing the section that I believe conflicts with the governor's proclamation 2028 relating to adherence for the opening of the public meetings act.",242,,
852,0.97,5939.533,5952.98,"Finally in order to find another way to support this bill, I also reached out to Seattle Department of construction director Torleson again to see if the findings could be written.",242,,
853,0.97,5952.98,5966.26,The findings are the words in the bill that explain the why it is in this case we feel that this is consistent with the governor's Opma act order.,242,,
854,0.97,5966.26,5977.171,"So, I reached out to see if the findings could be written differently to clarify that this section of the bill actually addressed a need related to the Covid-19 crisis.",242,,
855,0.97,5977.171,5995.322,For instance I suggested perhaps there might be barriers to the existing Sdci policy that affordable housing be Prioritized as a result of the current public health emergency or the passage of this bill putting more other kinds of construction prompts through administrative design review.,242,,
856,0.97,5995.322,6003.864,My hope was to include legal finds like this in the legislation that might create a legal path forward.,242,,
857,0.97,6003.864,6046.006,"Unfortunately director Torleson responded that it's good news that this is the case but it did not meet my my hope to draft the different legal findings but the response was, ultimately good news that if a significant number of projects were to move from full design review to administrative design review due to the passage of this legislation, and affordable housing projects were still required to go through administrative design review we would continue to in relation to market rate projects and commercial projects going through design review.",242,,
858,0.97,6046.006,6048.776,Consequently I could not concede.,242,,
859,0.97,6048.776,6068.929,Despite all of my efforts I don't see a path forward for me to support this bill that includes brand new policy to address a need unrelated to Covid-19 that is I believe out of the scope of the governor's proclamation.,242,,
860,0.97,6068.929,6075.602,I heard many people that the need to change administrative design review Predated the Covid-19 crisis.,242,,
861,0.97,6075.602,6081.074,I would have been interested in design review reform at the right time.,242,,
862,0.97,6081.074,6093.053,But my commitment to the open public meetings Act and the obligations to follow it when Deliberating on new policy unrelated to Covid-19 is Unwaiverring and principal.,242,,
863,0.97,6093.053,6110.104,"Nevertheless I appreciate the support of the members by Council members last week that I have sponsored, regarding a number of number of issues including regarding historic landmarks that were supported by historic Seattle, thank you.",242,,
864,0.97,6110.104,6113.04,Thank you Council member Herbold for those remarks.,243,,
865,0.97,6113.04,6120.547,Are there any other Council members who would like to make some remarks at this point?,243,,
866,0.97,6120.547,6120.814,Okay.,244,,
867,0.97,6120.814,6123.25,And Council member Juarez I'm not ignoring you.,244,,
868,0.97,6123.25,6129.623,"You do have some remarks you would like to make, I'm happy to hear from you.",244,,
869,0.97,6129.623,6135.262,"Actually, for the love of God let's take the vote.",245,,
870,0.97,6135.262,6135.529,Okay.,246,,
871,0.97,6135.529,6136.029,Council member Juarez.,246,,
872,0.97,6136.029,6136.396,Thank you.,247,,
873,0.97,6136.396,6137.664,Thank you so much.,248,,
874,0.97,6137.664,6144.371,We will make sure that the record reflecting that those are your comments to this bill.,248,,
875,0.97,6144.371,6190.017,"You know I just wanted to before I hand it over to Council member Strauss who's going to make the closing remarks, I do want to Council member Herbold's comments that she believes the inclusion of certain parts of this bill run a foul of the governor's legislation.",248,,
876,0.97,6190.017,6202.896,I want to say that we evaluate every legislation that comes before us to make sure it is appropriately before the city council in the construct of the governor's proclamation.,248,,
877,0.97,6202.896,6215.208,"Again, while I think that you know there could be different perspectives and points of you and in fact, the example is right here it's a living example.",248,,
878,0.97,6215.208,6220.681,I think Council member Herbolt has a much more conservative read of the proclamation.,248,,
879,0.97,6220.681,6234.962,I come to the conclusion along with the law Department that there's enough of an access here for us to appropriately consider this bill as Covid and emergency related.,248,,
880,0.97,6234.962,6236.663,So there is an argument that can be made.,248,,
881,0.97,6236.663,6239.633,There's an argument that has been made.,248,,
882,0.97,6239.633,6250.611,There is you know many conversations I've had with the office of housing for example related to the realities of how this economic crisis is going to impact.,248,,
883,0.97,6250.611,6269.83,Not just access to affordable housing but the development of affordable housing and our design review processes and permits and other administrative processes has a direct impact on what that pipeline will look like in the future.,248,,
884,0.97,6269.83,6303.463,"So there is in my view a reasonable rational connection between trying to address some of the operational issues that we control in the context that I think merit action and considering by the city council now through this Council bill in order to address those real operational impacts that are before us in only because we are in, in an emergency response period of time.",248,,
885,0.97,6303.463,6313.507,And where the way that business is usually conducted by these commissions and by the offices of housing are directly impacted.,248,,
886,0.97,6313.507,6341.368,"So I just feel really, I feel compelled to sort of explain my rational and my reasoning for allowing this legislation to be on the introduction and referral calendar in the first place and again I respect that there is a difference of opinion as it relates to the applicability to the governor's recommendation of this particular bill.",248,,
887,0.97,6341.368,6353.647,I will endeavor to account on each of you to make sure we have consistent application of the governor's the legislation as long as it is in effect on particular Legislations that come before the Council.,248,,
888,0.97,6353.647,6367.36,So that with that being said I'm going to go ahead and hand it over to Council member Strauss to close out debate so as Council member Juarez has so aptly put it for the love of God put this to a vote.,248,,
889,0.97,6367.36,6378.739,"Thank you Council President, thank you Council member Juarez for that extra Umph of getting it done.",249,,
890,0.97,6378.739,6383.777,I would like to start with my goal of getting this bill passed.,249,,
891,0.97,6383.777,6397.023,"If Kevin Shofield wrote if this is what Council looks like in the era of Opma where open public meetings act requirements require us to not count votes and so, sometimes this becomes messy.",249,,
892,0.97,6397.023,6406.666,In the public's eye and so this is my request that if anyone we have heard from Council member Herbold about what is needed for her to support this bill.,249,,
893,0.97,6406.666,6417.077,If there's anyone who is not anticipating to support the bill who had done so previously please let that be known before we take this bill.,249,,
894,0.97,6417.077,6430.29,You know really what I want to say is this experience has demonstrated to me the complexity of working remotely on complex information.,249,,
895,0.97,6430.29,6433.36,Very deep amounts of detailed analysis has to be done.,249,,
896,0.97,6433.36,6435.395,And working remotely can sometimes be challenging.,249,,
897,0.97,6435.395,6440.6,So I want to thank my colleagues.,249,,
898,0.97,6440.6,6446.173,"Council member Lewis, council member Pederson I know thank you for all of your thoughts.",249,,

1143,0.97,7469.028,7478.237,"So as a sponsor of this resolution, I will Convictly address it first and then ask for comments.",397,,
1144,0.97,7478.237,7484.143,"Already went through a long description of what this resolution is this morning, so I don't want to Belabor the point.",397,,
1145,0.97,7484.143,7498.057,This resolution ratify it is Mayor's executive order on placing a 50% cap on third party delivery services.,397,,
1146,0.97,7498.057,7531.69,"So this would apply to Larges that are placed or passed on to a restaurant, a Commission fee per Online delivery or pickup order for use of services that total more than 50% of the purchase price on such Onlined Orrers would be prohibited until restaurants are allowed to offer unrestricted Dine- in service and the States proclamation is Rekrinded or the other is rescinded, whichever is rescinded later.",397,,
1147,0.97,7531.69,7546.906,This also makes it unlawful for a third person at based delivery platform to reduce the rates paid to the driver or to garnish Gratuities as a result of this order going into effect during the duration of this order.,397,,
1148,0.97,7546.906,7557.516,"Importantly, in terms of enforcement, the city attorney's office will be the primary Enforcer of this executive order as they are for all executive orders.",397,,
1149,0.97,7557.516,7573.832,Anyone found to have knowingly violated this order will be guilty of a failure to obey the ordered and can be punished up to a fine of $500 or as otherwise provided by the municipal code.,397,,
1150,0.97,7573.832,7579.238,So the context of the executive order is rather simple.,397,,
1151,0.97,7579.238,7597.556,We were trying to in Corroboration with Council member Herbold and the Mayor keep the executive order narrowly focussed to address the relationship between third- party based App providers and restaurant owners.,397,,
1152,0.97,7597.556,7612.838,This morning I acknowledged that will will be a need for us to address the realities of the disparate relationship between drivers and these third party delivery Apps.,397,,
1153,0.97,7612.838,7634.927,Many of us on Council have worked with labor partners to lift up the stories of many of these drivers and other economy workers who are really working in a completely unregulated industry and have no protections whatsoever in this space.,397,,
1154,0.97,7634.927,7640.799,And so I think it's important for us to highlight that we recognize that is an issue.,397,,
1155,0.97,7640.799,7645.604,Those labor standards is an absolute issue and need in the community.,397,,
1156,0.97,7645.604,7663.088,"But this executive order is designed to be much more narrowly focused on, again, that relationship between these Apps and the restaurants and the contractual relationship between those two types of entities.",397,,
1157,0.97,7663.088,7698.223,"Nonetheless, we have included some language in this executive order to make sure that there isn't a negative impact to drivers as a result of the implementation of this executive order and looking forward to staying in contact with our labor partners to make sure as they are interacting with workers, that they are organizing, that we hear directly from them, even if it's an anecdotal fashion whether or not this is having an unintended consequence on that sector of the labor and our cities.",397,,
1158,0.97,7698.223,7714.473,"So I know there is much more to come on this and I know many of you on Council have been, like I, working with many of the labor partners on addressing issues related to this particular worker population.",397,,
1159,0.97,7714.473,7730.989,"So with that being said, I'm going to conclude my comments there because I made a lot of other comments during Council briefing this morning, and I am going to hand it over to Council member Morales who I understand has an amendment to the resolution that was not circulated before today's new deadline.",397,,
1160,0.97,7730.989,7737.863,"So in order for us to consider an amendment to the resolution, the suspension of the rules is needed.",397,,
1161,0.97,7737.863,7747.673,"So I'm going to, if there is no objection, the Council rules will be amended to something that was not circulated today.",397,,
1162,0.97,7747.673,7752.578,"So hearing no objection, council rules are Suspendnd and we will hear of the amendment.",397,,
1163,0.97,7752.578,7758.183,I will hand it over to Council member Morales so she can make her motion.,397,,
1164,0.97,7758.183,7765.891,I ask we amid by substituting version 2 or 1b as presented on the substitute recently distributed.,398,,

1211,0.97,7965.123,7976.034,I have been talking to some of our partners at the teamsters and Washington about the possibility of pursuing some additional legislation as we discussed this morning.,427,,
1212,0.97,7976.034,7978.203,I just want to flag my interest in that.,427,,
1213,0.97,7978.203,7988.547,"I want to flag my interest in that to the community as well, who is watching this afternoon and concerned about some of the things that aren't addressed by the order.",427,,
1214,0.97,7988.547,7996.855,"And just wanted to let everyone know, you know, I for one am interested.",427,,

1217,0.97,8008.433,8016.975,Council member Mosqueda.,429,,
1218,0.97,8016.975,8023.081,I want too make sure we reduce the fees they are imposing on these small businesses.,430,,
1219,0.97,8023.081,8041.8,"Right now we want to make sure our small businesses are not having additional fees imposed on them and we have heard stories, both Anecdotally and seen some data that indicates it is a hardship for many of these small businesses, these small restaurants having that fee imposed.",430,,
1220,0.97,8041.8,8056.114,But the second part we are talking about is the food creating have to be delivered to the homes of residents across the city and would not be done without the work of those on these App-Based platforms.,430,,
1221,0.97,8056.114,8072.531,I am concerned the original drafting of this executive order by the Mayor's office didn't include a more robust conversation with the teamsters with the folks in Washington and Additionally some of the folk that is have been reaching out to our office in an effort to engage in a robust conversation.,430,,
1222,0.97,8072.531,8075.4,I think we are looking for some solutions as well.,430,,
1223,0.97,8075.4,8087.512,I am appreciative of some of the language that you were able to get included in here to make sure that the ordinance--or not orders are clear.,430,,
1224,0.97,8087.512,8094.953,We don't want to see reduction in wages and we don't want to see reduction in Gratuity.,430,,
1225,0.97,8094.953,8102.327,"As we commit to work with stake holders and teamsters 117, there is a few pieces I would like to call our attention to.",430,,
1226,0.97,8102.327,8118.877,"We have heard repeatedly there has been ongoing training that's been offered to fleet, if you will, to individuals who do the delivery, but this has not been accompanied by adequate Ppe's.",430,,
1227,0.97,8118.877,8125.984,We need to see personal protective equipment to these that are delivering food to our community members.,430,,
1228,0.97,8125.984,8154.112,"It has already been mentioned hazard pay for these, access to Restrooms is something we have a concern for, those who don't have a place to use their Restroom in their own home because they are House less, but workers and folks across the city who need access to a clean accessible Restrooms, making sure the folks providing this service, delivering food can also access Restrooms in a safe way that also works for small businesses.",430,,
1229,0.97,8154.112,8170.529,"I appreciate the language Council member Morales put forward in conjunction with Council member Gonzalez, wage communities and locations by your amendment.",430,,
1230,0.97,8170.529,8187.012,"And Council President spoken well about this, but I think our concern remains around enforcement and I think we will be looking for Ols to provide additional information because we know people reach out to Ols as sort of the default agency where they seek information.",430,,
1231,0.97,8187.012,8199.324,So looking forward to making sure it's very clear to folks how to report if there are either unintended consequences or issues that might have cropped up that have not been fully addressed.,430,,
1232,0.97,8199.324,8238.697,"So again, I want to thank the folks who have been working to highlight some concerns that are ongoing and I think the full commitment from this Council, as you heard, are to address Ppe training, hazard pay and that we are intentional to come back and work with the Teamsters, Washington and those who reached out to our office and I appreciate that this is one piece of that or one step, as has been described today, to make sure our smallest businesses, those restaurants don't have this fee imposed on them and I will support the ordinance with all the work that you have done Council president and with the amendments that you have included.",430,,
1233,0.97,8238.697,8242.667,Thank you so much.,431,,
1234,0.97,8242.667,8247.305,"Council member Sawant, I thought I saw you raise your hand.",431,,
1235,0.97,8247.305,8250.675,Just confirming you are up next.,431,,
1236,0.97,8250.675,8252.611,"Thank you, council Gonzalez.",432,,
1237,0.97,8252.611,8272.297,"I will be supporting this today and want to reiterate the points made by some other Council members about the need to explicitly look out for the interests of some of our most vulnerable workers, workers that are not recognized as employees, who are misclassified as independence contractors.",432,,
1238,0.97,8272.297,8283.842,I suddenly support having an order to protect small business restaurants from being gouged by delivery companies and organized small business rent control.,432,,
1239,0.97,8283.842,8299.824,"However, I am in solidarity with the concern expressed by working Washington by the teamsters and other community organizations that protect local interest that we cannot stop this protective order.",432,,
1240,0.97,8299.824,8349.607,"We need to represent the workers in the restaurants or interest of delivery Driverers who are risking their lives for very little compensation and in the absence of protect ICH equipment--hardly any protective equipment and as working Washington said they are an organization that is helping organizing delivery workers who will be directly impacted by orders such as these and as well as restaurant workers and workers with other industries and, you know, to quote working Washington from their letter when they expressed concerns about this executive Orderer, they said ""delivery drivers among the lowest paid in the city with rates of $1.35 per hour on door dash.",432,,
1241,0.97,8349.607,8406.03,"Restaurant workers are at least protected by Seattle minimum wage, $15 minimum wage, but because delivery workers are misclassified as independence contractors, they look many of those protections, many of the worker protections and I really strongly agree with working Washington' letter that, you know, and in fact, they made some of the demands earlier on and also by the grassroots strike of Insta card workers and the working Washington letter actually reiterate some of the Strikeup workers and to quote from strike--workers strike statement on--and working Washington, they are urging that this Council really push for requiring hazard pay surcharge of $5 per delivery.",432,,
1242,0.97,8406.03,8427.018,And if--and they say that is for somebody not possible to enact emergency rules and you can as an alternative imposing a parallel on the delivery fees and service charges and opportunity to take the workers--to help the workers providing the service.,432,,
1243,0.97,8427.018,8433.391,I also would say that I strongly support the work that is being done by the office of labor standards.,432,,
1244,0.97,8433.391,8476.301,"We are to make sure as a Council we stand against any kind of budget cuts and this discussion has come in the context of the legislation that we have to impose any kind of budget cuts because the budget cuts will in fact--city departments like the office of labor standard, who if they have their staffing cut or their staffing is not able to be Augustmented, then Ed Augmeted, then Itwill not be able to be carried out in a Goodmaner.",432,,
1245,0.97,8476.301,8477.435,Thank you.,433,,
1246,0.97,8477.435,8477.702,Strousz.,433,,
1247,0.97,8477.702,8479.437,Thank you.,434,,
1248,0.97,8479.437,8484.342,We also need to identify how we protect our workers who are delivering these foods.,434,,
1249,0.97,8484.342,8501.059,We need to take into consideration how we can protect good actor such as post meats mates and identify people who are keeping us living the lives as normally as possible.,434,,
1250,0.97,8501.059,8527.752,"When I was in the Meri Corps, I was a firefighter and firefighters, when they are just at the station receive one rate of pay and when you have fire under your feet and smoke in your lungs, you receive H pay because you are putting your health on the line as a hazard and I think we need H pay for our workers here in the city, making it so we can live the life as normal as possible.",434,,
1251,0.97,8527.752,8530.555,Thank you,434,,
1252,0.97,8530.555,8534.259,"Thank you, council member Strauss.",435,,
1253,0.97,8534.259,8535.193,Council member Herbold.,435,,
1254,0.97,8535.193,8536.361,Thank you.,436,,
1255,0.97,8536.361,8542.3,I want to underscore one of the comment that is has been made.,436,,
1256,0.97,8542.3,8555.113,It will be with this passage unlawful for a delivery platform to reduce compensation rates paid to delivery service Driverer or Garnished Gratuities when this goes into effect.,436,,
1257,0.97,8555.113,8585.944,"I want to take responsibility that I was an early advocate for us to use the vehicle of an emergency order to address this issue quickly, and was assured that we would deal separately with some of the issues around minimum compensation for delivery drivers who are not otherwise considered employees.",436,,
1258,0.97,8585.944,8606.264,"I think it's really important to recognize that with this Act that we are about to take, we are not only helping small businesses, but we are helping the people who are considered employees under the law of those small businesses.",436,,
1259,0.97,8606.264,8627.352,"We know that in Seattle the majority of employees actually work for small businesses, and so it's really important to recognize that this is an act that is designed to make it possible for small businesses to continue to employ people.",436,,
1260,0.97,8627.352,8655.513,"Many of the businesses in my district who came to me about this emergency order, as was passed in San Francisco, told me that they were considering that the paycheck protection program--what we referred to as Ppe, which was a paycheck protection program was going to be the thing that was going to come to their rescue and allow them to continue to pay their employees.",436,,
1261,0.97,8655.513,8677.535,And it's because of the failure of the paycheck protection program to meet the needs of small businesses that they are then reaching out to the Council on this issue related to capping service charges so that they can continue to pay their employees as well as stay open.,436,,
1262,0.97,8677.535,8698.656,"So many thanks to Madam President Gonzalez, as well as the Mayor's office and working quickly to pull this together and look forward to continued work to address the needs of the drivers and moving quickly on that.",436,,
1263,0.97,8698.656,8715.373,"But I'm also, again, reassured that the order before us makes very clear what is not lawful and what the process is for our city to have the city attorney enforce emergency orders that are violated.",436,,
1264,0.97,8715.373,8717.041,Thank you.,436,,
1265,0.97,8717.041,8718.676,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",437,,
1266,0.97,8718.676,8723.181,Well said.,437,,
1267,0.97,8723.181,8725.583,I don't have anything else to add to that.,437,,
1268,0.97,8725.583,8727.552,I don't have any more comments.,437,,
1269,0.97,8727.552,8730.588,"Council, any other comments before I close this out?",437,,
1270,0.97,8730.588,8730.788,Okay.,437,,
1271,0.97,8730.788,8732.256,No other comments.,437,,

1294,0.97,8776.033,8781.772,I ask the clerk please affix my signature to the resolution.,456,,
1295,0.97,8781.772,8794.852,"Colleagues, we have one last item of business on the agenda and that is the letter that Council member Lewis circulated during the Council briefing meeting.",456,,
1296,0.97,8794.852,8808.432,So I'm going to ask Council member Lewis if you have any other comments to add before I ask the clerk to call--call that to a vote.,456,,
1297,0.97,8808.432,8815.239,"Well, actually, council member Gonzalez, my office circulated three letters.",457,,
1298,0.97,8815.239,8820.144,I just wanted to make sure that that was clear.,457,,
1299,0.97,8820.144,8823.08,But I guess I could ask what specific letter you are referring to.,457,,
1300,0.97,8823.08,8827.385,I'm referring to any of the letters you want signed during full council.,458,,
1301,0.97,8827.385,8828.052,Right.,459,,
1302,0.97,8828.052,8831.189,So the first is the Amazon Mlk letter.,459,,
1303,0.97,8831.189,8839.397,The second is a letter to the University of Washington school of medicine urging an equitable contract.,459,,
1304,0.97,8839.397,8847.205,The third one is an arts letter about unemployment insurance reimbursement rates for our Federal delegation.,459,,
1305,0.97,8847.205,8848.873,Those are the three letters.,459,,
1306,0.97,8848.873,8864.689,"I didn't receive any changes in between morning briefing and now, so I guess I would just ask based on that if folks had the chance to review--all the letters were distributed last week before full counsel, I believe.",459,,
1307,0.97,8864.689,8865.022,No.,460,,
1308,0.97,8865.022,8870.628,I think you are--there was some letters that were circulated today just at 12:15.,460,,

1310,0.97,8870.995,8873.097,Yeah.,462,,

1312,0.97,8877.101,8885.743,"But I was actually--I was under the impression that those had been circulated earlier than that, so I apologize.",463,,
1313,0.97,8885.743,8888.646,The Amazon letter was circulated by the Council itself.,463,,
1314,0.97,8888.646,8897.355,"So we could at least call for a vote on that one and I will circle back on the other two, to give people time.",463,,
