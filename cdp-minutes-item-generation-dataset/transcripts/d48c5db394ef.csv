58,0.97,427.56,431.364,But I do want to share a couple of Department specific updates.,4,,
59,0.97,431.364,446.979,"From the human services Department, we know that the human services Department is seeking applications from organizations interested in food equity for its Seattle school program serving low income children and families.",4,,
60,0.97,446.979,464.664,"This is the farm to table proposal, it will invest about $840,000 in healthy, local, sustainable culturally relevant food and education and approximately 50 preschool programs located across the city.",4,,
61,0.97,464.664,480.213,"Who serve about 2000 children ages 3-5. it has two components, nutrition education, and farm to family food banks for Seattle families and staff.",4,,
62,0.97,480.213,496.963,"The Rfp focuses on Sourcing from Washington state farmers operated and owned by black, indigenous and people of color families who are farmers and business owners, immigrants, refugees and women.",4,,
63,0.97,496.963,499.599,There is an information session coming up for the Rfp on Friday.,4,,
64,0.97,499.599,507.707,Application due may 3. for more information go to the Website and click on the funding opportunities but in.,4,,
65,0.97,507.707,528.828,"As it relates to public safety update, I think we have all seen here on Council, but for you in public, we've been talking a lot about her interest in receiving a report from the executive we request, the Council requested during the budget process.",4,,
66,0.97,528.828,538.17,Report on citywide hiring incentives many of us raised this issue during the 2022 budget discussions.,4,,
67,0.97,538.17,550.383,"The report does note that a number of positions across departments, that are critical to city business needs are in fact challenging to fill.",4,,
68,0.97,550.383,552.852,And these positions are not limited to police officers and 911 Dispatchers.,4,,
69,0.97,552.852,557.89,This is what we suspected when we requested the report.,4,,
70,0.97,557.89,572.271,"The response also notes that there are challenges with the city's classification title and of note, the need to update the cities 38-Year-Old classification and compensation system.",4,,
71,0.97,572.271,584.483,"And that that would help attract employees, though it would be a large--a large part of it would take significant time.",4,,
72,0.97,584.483,589.789,"Regarding hiring incentives generally, the report identifies both benefits and drawbacks.",4,,
73,0.97,589.789,615.147,"As it relates specifically to SPD and the community safety communication center, it States that SPD did not experience an increase in hiring since implementing a hiring incentive program--a hiring incentive into their process in October 2021.",4,,
74,0.97,615.147,623.689,And they note that the Cscc did see an increase in candidates entering the hiring process since the plantation of the incentive over the same period of time.,4,,
75,0.97,623.689,630.196,"So, they acknowledge that they didn't have very much time to analyze the incentive period.",4,,
76,0.97,630.196,656.222,"But they did note that they could definitely see an Uptick during the period of time for Cscc and they found that the fact that there didn't appear to be much of an uptake for SPD, that was an inconclusive finding as it relates specifically.",4,,
77,0.97,656.222,683.416,"Whether or not SPD has seen benefits from incentives and they NOTE again it's incredibly difficult to conclude because incentives have been offered and removed several times, as a reminder, in 2019, the Council enacted and SPD hiring incentive program that I think went for about a year there is some limited data available about that.",4,,
78,0.97,683.416,707.673,"As well, I think generally that particular study on the 2019 incentive program showed that about 20% of applicants, not necessarily people who were hired, but applicants, point to the bonus program is playing into their decision to apply to become a police officer.",4,,
79,0.97,707.673,729.328,"So, since receiving this on Friday, I submitted a number of questions and will definitely appreciate getting into more detail with Council members once I dig more into the report and get some answers to these questions.",4,,
80,0.97,729.328,732.932,And I am sure there is plenty more to say about this in the coming weeks.,4,,
81,0.97,732.932,733.999,Moving on to updates.,4,,
82,0.97,733.999,740.573,As far as this week I will be attending the housing development consortium event this week.,4,,
83,0.97,740.573,746.779,I will also be chairing the meeting of the police pension board on Tuesday.,4,,
84,0.97,746.779,787.553,"Also, there will be a public event, virtual public hearing from sound transit focused on the West Seattle portion . and the focus will be on the the EIS, this is on the 30th, Wednesday, there is information on how to participate and comment on the sound transit EIS page and you can find it at my Blog . Thursday I will be attending an event of the big brothers and big sisters of Puget sound.",4,,
85,0.97,787.553,792.024,"On Wednesday, as far as regional committees, I will be attending as an alternate to the regional policy committee.",4,,
86,0.97,792.024,800.432,Just a quick Recap of my office hours last week.,4,,
87,0.97,800.432,821.754,"I held office hours Friday afternoon last week meeting with constituents from all over district 1. on topics ranging from crime, projects, garbage projects, the pay up minimum compensation policy, and the future of the Irving street.",4,,
88,0.97,821.754,823.556,That is all I have for my remarks today.,4,,
89,0.97,823.556,828.06,To any of my colleagues have comments?,4,,
90,0.97,828.06,828.594,Councilmember Nelson.,4,,
91,0.97,828.594,836.168,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold . You mentioned the report, so I wanted to follow up on that.",5,,
92,0.97,836.168,849.114,"Is my colleagues no, I did send an Email out with some comments in context for some of the inconclusive findings of the two page memo which has been delayed twice.",5,,
93,0.97,849.114,871.503,"So anyway, per the discussion about hiring incentives for SPD and their success, they do NOTE it had been in effect for a short time, about two months at the end of last year.",5,,
94,0.97,871.503,881.88,"So I mentioned in my Email, the most salient point was that I do not believe that hiring numbers are going to be a good indication of whether or not that program was a success.",5,,
95,0.97,881.88,891.423,Because the SPD hiring process is at minimum six months long for both lateral and basic law enforcement hires.,5,,
96,0.97,891.423,902.001,"It's actually, as I said, by my logic, impossible for anyone to have been hired as a result of that hiring incentive process.",5,,
97,0.97,902.001,904.136,"Because, we haven't come to six months yet.",5,,
98,0.97,904.136,913.946,"Also, perhaps a better measure of the success of the program is level of interest.",5,,
99,0.97,913.946,929.361,"In the public safety meeting last week we did hear from chief Diaz who mentioned there was a sharp, that there was an increase in interest that, when they were in the program implemented, there were more--let me read the quote.",5,,
100,0.97,929.361,936.702,"There were, in January we had our highest Sign-Up in testing since 2020.",5,,
101,0.97,936.702,938.771,There are several rounds of tests in the hiring process.,5,,
102,0.97,938.771,948.881,In March we dropped drastically down to six people signing up for testing and that was when the program had ended.,5,,
103,0.97,948.881,954.186,I sent this Email simply to say I think that hiring is not a good indicator of the success of the program.,5,,
104,0.97,954.186,957.189,Thank you very much for noting the inconclusive nature of that report.,5,,
105,0.97,957.189,959.224,Thank you.,5,,
106,0.97,959.224,979.511,"Thank you, . I was just about to say I thought I said--I appreciate you recognizing that I did quote from the report that it determines that it is inconclusive based on that data for the short period of time.",6,,
107,0.97,979.511,991.757,"I did refer as well, and I'm happy to share with folks, it is also, I would say pretty inconclusive because were supposed to report out on a longer Timeframe.",6,,
108,0.97,991.757,1017.549,"But we do have a, I think it's about a six month report, and that's what I referred from the 2019 bonus program that I referred to earlier where they identified that about 20% of applicants mention that the reason why they applied is because of the incentives or that the incentives played a large part in the reason why they applied.",6,,
109,0.97,1017.549,1028.193,That was sort of a partial Snapshot of a larger report that was due in 2020 that the Department never completed for us.,6,,
110,0.97,1028.193,1032.197,I will be happy to share and send it around as well.,6,,
111,0.97,1032.197,1035.134,Any other questions?,6,,
112,0.97,1035.134,1038.037,Comments?,6,,
113,0.97,1038.037,1040.639,All right.,6,,
114,0.97,1040.639,1047.413,Seeing none I will pass it on to Councilmember Morales.,6,,

119,0.97,1062.461,1073.639,"And thank you, Council President replacing the consent agenda, I thought they might be going on the committee reports because I ended up having to cancel my Committee for lack of Quorum on Friday.",7,,
120,0.97,1073.639,1093.992,"So again, my apologies to those 11 appointees who were waiting to be heard and to the interim directors, office of immigrant energy affairs and office of arts and culture who were prepared to present and did not.",7,,
121,0.97,1093.992,1109.174,My committee happens to be where we engage most closely with neighbors who are particularly interested in serving the city on a board or Commission.,7,,
122,0.97,1109.174,1121.153,"They volunteer hours of their time to conduct research, provide recommendations, provide their expertise and lived experience to us, Council, as we deliberate on policy decisions.",7,,
123,0.97,1121.153,1138.437,"The appointments are an important part of conducting the people's business, which is what we all signed up to do, whether it's high-profile policy work or the more routine work that really keeps the gears of government moving.",7,,
124,0.97,1138.437,1162.794,"We have an obligation to show up and do the work and so, I appreciate Councilmember Nelson for being there and there were a couple of excused absences, but it's really important that we make sure our committees are able to meet . I just want to let my colleagues know that my staff will be hoping to Brainstorm with the L.A.",7,,
125,0.97,1162.794,1176.408,At the meeting this week about how to provide better notice when folks aren't going to be around . I'm hopeful we can resolve this so the committee work can proceed as scheduled.,7,,
126,0.97,1176.408,1180.679,I do have a lot of appointments in my committee.,7,,
127,0.97,1180.679,1181.48,Some are couple years old.,7,,
128,0.97,1181.48,1183.115,I would like to move through them.,7,,
129,0.97,1183.115,1188.987,We do have lots of legislation coming through as well so it's important that we hold these meetings and be able to vote.,7,,

131,0.97,1194.493,1197.729,Three appointments to the community involvement Commission.,7,,
132,0.97,1197.729,1209.508,And then there will be three people who will be appointed to serve out the remainder of a term they should've started two years ago . as it happens there is only two months left on this term.,7,,
133,0.97,1209.508,1215.614,And that will be followed immediately by a reappointment of those three people to a full second term.,7,,
134,0.97,1215.614,1223.555,"If it seems a little confusing, when we get there tomorrow, I'm happy to walk through it again.",7,,
135,0.97,1223.555,1224.756,But that is what is happening.,7,,
136,0.97,1224.756,1231.23,They are being appointed for the end of an existing term and then immediately for the next term.,7,,

142,0.97,1262.127,1271.703,"There's a lot of challenges, I guess, with parents who are having to Chase after multiple kids . There's a fear of them running into the parking lot or worse, running into the street.",7,,

150,0.97,1335.167,1340.539,"And I just want to state again, this is a practice that I feel is incredibly inhumane.",7,,
151,0.97,1340.539,1361.626,"And I feel like this could've been avoided if we had invested more appropriately in just care, hoping that we will continue those conversations with the regional housing authority and make sure we are investing to solve people's problems instead of creating ones for them per.",7,,

156,0.97,1397.596,1399.931,"We are talking about years of construction, potential businesses being displaced.",7,,
157,0.97,1399.931,1414.012,"And the challenge is that again, in part because of the language challenges, there is not clarity about what mitigation strategies are being offered in any of the options being presented.",7,,
158,0.97,1414.012,1437.636,"And so there is a real interest on behalf of the community and behalf of Sdot to make sure that sound transit is providing clarity about what they're willing to commit to in terms of mitigation strategies, not what they might do or what possibilities are, but what can the community expect are the mitigation strategies that will be put in place.",7,,
159,0.97,1437.636,1454.886,"So, I am hopeful that that can be made clear to sound transit because community members can't make a choice at this point about what the preferred alternative is without some clarity on mitigation strategies.",7,,

164,0.97,1474.673,1481.079,And Lehigh is looking for advocacy and funding on their behalf.,7,,
165,0.97,1481.079,1487.786,"Colleagues, you know I have been meeting with folks in the Mount Baker area for almost 2 years now.",7,,
166,0.97,1487.786,1504.636,Part of what we are hearing from them and part of what we committed to them as we could help some folks living in the encampment move into this Lehigh village when it was completed . We can't do that until they get the funding they need to actually work on operations.,7,,
167,0.97,1504.636,1509.674,These challenges are sort of Cascading if we can to make sure the location of these strategies is working.,7,,
168,0.97,1509.674,1522.754,"Finally, with regard to last week, my staff met with the community group looking to purchase the multifamily apartment building in district 2 to take it off the speculator market and move it into community control.",7,,
