5,0.97,790.723,805.538,"Just Superquick, a baseline R me . that last, last point on the the previous slide about the vacant positions, is, is that---- are those the positions that are Colloquially referred to as ghost positions?",2,,
6,0.97,805.538,808.774,"Ghost, as in, positions Thate that are unfilled?",3,,
7,0.97,808.774,822.421,"That are, that are unfilled, unfunded but are used as a baseline for the next year's proposed budget, as I understand understand the conversation was last year.",4,,
8,0.97,822.421,878.744,"Yeah . So we have a number of authorized positions, our baseline is held on the number of authorized positions, and from there, we make incremental changes to account for the positions that are filled . Some departments use a vacancy rate to account for the differences N differences between their funded, budgeted positions, and authorized positions, but in this particular case, going into into the budget process, our baseline budget funded approximately 1317 sworn Positis sworn positions, and in 2022, we we were funded for 1200 through our initial budget process . We looked at how many positions were funded in the baseline budget, and then built the proposed budget around that.",5,,

10,0.97,892.291,902.868,"Yeah, I'll add, I'll add, when Greg I, he'll do a more thorough breakdown of the staffing plan, but I just want to note that item number one here, this 11 million reduction for 80 FTE, is 80 FTE, is an ongoing reduction,, and has not happened in the.",7,,
11,0.97,902.868,932.765,"This is something Council has pointed to in the last two cycles of the budget, where there was not an ongoing cut Tan for any portion of the unfilled positions, and so item number one there is, is an ongoing cut that we, the position stays at SPD, but we would not expect that in 24, '25 . item number two two here is a, a Runtime use of salary savings to reinvest in the Department.",7,,
12,0.97,932.765,954.687,"All right . I saw Councilman D Councilman Herbold--Aic, and so this is the, the slide that folks should look at if They'Reg that there were 80 positions Tht were actually reduced from the overall budget positions, not filled, nobody's getting cut.",8,,
13,0.97,954.687,962.461,But these are positions that are are traditionally not Pilled.,8,,
14,0.97,962.461,988.42,"These are actually the positions positions that we are hoping to aggregate in previous Discussios that it would be a more accurate of the number of staff that currently are within the Department, and thus the amount of money needed Year-Over-Year.T Year-Over-Year . But item number two here still shows that there is 120 positions that are also not being filled, but that there that there is an assumption that that those Ftes will stay at the the Department . The funding staying at the Department, but being used for something else L, this proposed by annual budget.",8,,
15,0.97,988.42,991.557,Is that correct?,8,,
16,0.97,991.557,993.359,"Yes, that's almost precisely.",9,,
17,0.97,993.359,1015.314,"Precisely correct . The only piece that I will update is that, technically, all 200 pockets stay vacant at the, at the Department . It is the Fundig the funding for 80 of them that is cut in an ongoing way, and the savings from the other 120 is a one time reinvestment this year.",9,,
18,0.97,1015.314,1060.459,"Okay . So not technically aggregation . But actual transparency on reducing the Fug the funding, having that be seen as a budget item, being moved into the general fund for the PS of something else, at least as it relates to the 80. okay . and, and, and Greg, I know that this was information that we were Rey trying to lift up over the last two years to get greater transparency on where those dollars were going, and Whethers were being filled, and whether they were remaining at the Depat the Department, just, chronically unfilled . So thank you for your work to help continue to surface these issues issues for the city council . do you have something to add?",10,,
19,0.97,1060.459,1130.562,"Yeah . All I did was, was bugged the Department to, to be a little bit more pension with it, and director Sochi and director Tingley have, have really, really been very transparent in this, and, and it's really easy to follow and understand, and that is so fantastic . I, I would point out that on, on item number two, the the 16.9 million, a number of these items, as director so Shes through her, through her Presen, her presentation, a number of them are ongoing . So when we talk about this being one time, it is a one time use of salary savings . But SPD will need, in the future, to fund these, and, and likely will be using Salarys salary savings, you know, is using salary savings in '24, and and will probably have to you salary savings ongoing . as, as it hires officers in the future, future, if it were to actually t up to hire 120 officers, it would need to start adding money money to its budget, but that is is probably a long way off.",11,,
20,0.97,1131.23,1134.867,All right . please go ahead.,12,,
21,0.97,1134.867,1170.569,"All right . Thank you . So with with this, I might be reiterating some points that, that we've made here, but just so it's very clear for everyone, to determine available Vacancys vacancy savings for the budget changes we just discussed, we used our sworn staffing model to to estimate our future Staffings staffing models . In any given year, SPD's budget is made up of of 75% to 80% personnel costs, so it's hugely Impactful as we're developing our budget.",13,,
22,0.97,1170.569,1173.939,"Unlike other departments, we DOT apply a standard vacancy rate.",13,,

25,0.97,1181.947,1205.604,". This information is shared Wih central staff to, to validate and confirm our assumptions in the budget . The proposed budget for '23 is over 75% salary benefit costs . In 2023, as currently written, the proposed budget supports 1115 sworn FTE, which is down from 1200 in 2022.",13,,
26,0.97,1205.604,1226.592,". If you look at the blue and green chart lines in the table here, you will see how the funded and filled FTE aligned in in both 2023 and 2024. we've included the fully trained officer counts, and the officers officers in service count as well, just for comparison . next.",13,,
27,0.97,1226.592,1254.486,"Next slide . all right . This table shows our hiring assumptions for 2023 and 2024 alongside historic Actuals . in both years, we set a sworn hiring target of 120 new hires and 105 separations . again, this incredibly important for the budget, because we build our proposed budget around these assumptions using our staffing.",13,,
28,0.97,1254.486,1278.81,"Staffing model . We, historically, we used to base tt separation number on average separations . We no longer do that for two reasons . First, our our annual separations have Flud dramatically in recent years, and the average rate of Separats is no longer a reliable metric.",13,,
29,0.97,1278.81,1339.571,"Second, as noted on the Previou, we do not use a standard vacancy vacancy rate like other departments . When building our L budget . and if we overestimate R sworn separations, we're at risk risk of Underfunding our personnel budget if our, if our predictions are off at all . and, you can see in this chart that separations specifically have fluctuated widely in the last five to 10 years, and we are, from 2020 and 2021, obviously, seeing, we saw an incredible Dee incredible departure of our sworn personnel . If we achieve our hiring and separation targets in risk 23 and '24, we're looking to have around 1090 fully trained officers by the end of '24 . up from, up from 1050 in August of this year.",13,,

32,0.97,1344.876,1377.642,"A question, Socci . We know that a number of these officers who also left the force in 202, 2021, possibly even this year, is do it to not wanting to comply with the public health GE health guidance for getting a vaccine . can you remind us how Y of these officers have left because of their inability to get a vaccine, or inability to have a different position to accommodate them?",14,,

34,0.97,1380.145,1392.29,"That question . We've only had four administrative separations for vaccine mandate . so as much as others have said there's a whole lot more, there's actually four that have been Administraty separated.",15,,
35,0.97,1392.29,1412.511,"So when we hear numbers of, like, 80 to 90 people who refuse refuse to to get their vaccines in one year alone, and they've t been put on hold, or leave, Ands and that's affecting the number of officers that are available on actual patrol, that's not what this number is representing?",16,,
36,0.97,1412.511,1427.392,"So there are a number of Peoe that have requested religious and medical exemptions, and there--people also have left, or not left the Department, but they're on long-term leave for a for a variety of different REAS.",17,,
37,0.97,1427.392,1437.736,"Different reasons . You have people that are on maternity leave, you have people that are on military leave that have not provided any information on exemptions, because they could be deployed out to another Coun.",17,,
38,0.97,1437.736,1495.393,"So we can't give you the exact, because there's a variety of different reasons why somebody might not have already provided some level of an exemption . What what we do know is, is that we E we have a small number of Peoplt are in medical exemptions, probably under 10, and we have a a small number of people that are under religious exemptions, Y exemptions, probably in around, I believe, 25 that are requesting it . There is no access to a new type of shot that is different from--that doesn't use stem cells, I Beliee stem cells, and that's, some people have returned since that, that, since that access to that new shot .

It's the basis for our plans for not only compliance and ongoing Sustainment, but also for the continuation of our our police reform efforts once the consent decree is closed out . Many of you also benefit from the information that's housed in that system . It is the the source of data for our public Dashboards, our use of force data, everything, Ideally, Ideally, would be housed in there to, to allow for quicker access to information . a portion portion of this item, you'll see see that there's 3 million planned for 2023, and 1.5 million planned for 2024. some of this is necessary, ongoing maintenance and Sustainment of this platform .

I appreciate the, that it's a tool, also, for also, for the monitor under the consent decree that is not in any way in dispute from me . I have come to fondly referred to the Dap as the dam that, because because it seems like every time time we talk about it, it is related to something that, we, we hoped it would do, but it doesn't do . Most recently, there there was the issue that was resolved, but that was flagged E flagged because of a problem with the data integration on, with, with the Dap of a very large number of unknowns reported as it relates to race and use of force . The chief has a number of years ago, when I asked how we were moving forward forward on recommendations associated with an advisory Grop advisory group to focus on the problems related with the lack, complete lack of oversight, of off-duty work, as opposed to overtime work, off-duty work . I was told that the D.A.P . was not not designed to allow the Depat the Department to, to have the t the oversight of the number of hours that officers were working working overtime, and then a third example I can think of is a number of years, you know, we're, we're reporting on race as it relates to a large Numberf number of police contacts, but I I think it was in 2018, now Mayor Harrell been Councilmembe, Councilmember Harold, Champion a piece of legislation focused on Nonbiased policing, and one Ofe requirements is that there be reporting on traffic stops, on, on the racial demographics of people who are recipients of tis of tickets and stops from SPD, and we were told for several years that the D.A.P . did not W that, that information to be, to to be reported .

The traffic tickets were handled in a variety of ways, both using the sector system and with some of the Muni court records . those just hadn't yet brought into the the S.W.A.T .. the issue with the unknowns and the use of force, that was an identified PM identified problem, and, as you know, we rapidly fixed that, bee what's important to the data ANALYTICS platform is it's not just a computer, not just a too, it's actually a system that includes data Governance . So when we find errors, when we find things that are lacking, Whenwe find, you know, any potential problem with this, we have an automated way of, of putting forth what's called a dl a Decal, which is--puts it in to the Queue for remediation . So remediation . So the system itself kicks out errors . We have have teams that look at that, and we are continually improving improving the system to ensure that it's as accurate as Possib.",33,,

75,0.97,2332.93,2361.892,"So we fixed it . But you are right, that is a problem . You know, in full transparency, as we continue to work with the D.A.P ., we are going to find other problems, and then we Areg to Remediate them, and that's part of the evolution of the system, getting it better and better and more refined . and honestly, there's no data system data system out there that is accurate and functions independently of this continual audit that happens with this Sy.",33,,

As everyone everyone knows, we are experiencing a historic staffing staffing crisis, and overtime, has been one of many ways that E that we are attempting to meet service demands . in the case of item nine, this item funds $150,000 for our harbor patrol, which is currently, I believe, about 40% to 50% capacity . This will allow them to continue Marine patrols during the summer summer voting season . It also supports maintenance costs for the operation . They have a Numbr of vessels that were purchased with grant funds, and who have to maintain these in a Case-By-E a case-by-case ad hoc basis . and and so this would create a permanent budget for vessel maintenance specifically . Greg, did you want to --",38,,
85,0.97,2540.804,2543.674,"I have a question, when you're done.",39,,
86,0.97,2543.674,2579.643,"Okay . and then for item 10, this is a $2.6 million investment . It's a partial respiration of our overtime budget, our pretend that overtime budget . This will be used to meet staff in an emergency response, and also support special event overtime needs and violent crime now, Greg, do you want to ask the question?",40,,
87,0.97,2579.643,2622.252,"I'll just . a couple Councilmembers have expressed questions about the harbor patrol deployment, and specifically, if it would be deployed any differently than harbor patrol is normally Deplod normally deployed, such that it would respond to community evens community events and, in other words, purchase community events, community needs . normal use situations on the water in a a proportional way, the same Wa, it normally would, or is there going to be any kind of a special distribution of these Hs these hours in a different way?",41,,
88,0.97,2622.252,2647.711,"You know, just to get the same kind of proportional service that would, without these, just, just, in addition . So wondering if, if you were the chief, could, could talk a little bit about that.",41,,
89,0.97,2647.711,2649.48,"I, I can fill in that, that.",42,,
90,0.97,2649.48,2696.66,"And this allows us, right now, our staffing would really just allow for one boat, and if you can imagine, we could only go up go up to a certain level of knots on the waterway because of because of the housing that Fitn the waterway . too much Dribbling much Dribbling of the water can create damage for the Residencen the water . So having us to be Ae to have two boats operational during the summer months, it allows us--not only do we have we have Saltwater, so we have to to go through locks for the one part, and then we also have Likt and Washington . So having two boats allows us to spread out and have a better distribution throughout all of the waterways that we patrol . and it allows us us to get quicker to, to locations, so that we we're not going through the Uw for every single time that we got deployed deployed out to saint Andrews.",42,,
91,0.97,2696.66,2700.731,"So this just allows us more flex more flex ability, and allows us allows us to actually be in Mors at once.",42,,

93,0.97,2701.465,2754.518,"Thank you . Thanks, Greg, for kind of Teeing this up . So this is something that I've been talking about for about 2 1/2, almost three and years now, Tryg to get an understanding of how many boats there are, how many harbor patrol officers there are, where they're deployed . MYG my understanding, through these conversations, has been that there is no, nobody sort of--I'm not a Boater, I don't know E language, anchored in Lake Washn Lake Washington . and so, as you, chief, if there is a disturbance disturbance in Andrews Bay, it requires somebody coming from Lake Union . and by the time you get to Andrews Bay, the event might be over . So I'm, so, first first of all, I want to make sure that if that is sort of status quo, that I'm understanding that correctly.",44,,
94,0.97,2754.518,2769.666,"And then, if, if what you're sag is that this is adding one Moret more boat, where will that boat be housed?",44,,
95,0.97,2769.666,2771.568,"Senior deputy, did you want to take that?",45,,
96,0.97,2771.568,2818.849,"Yeah, I'll take this a little little bit . So the, the importance of this is, to be honest, if we had more funding, I would've applied it to this particular area . We have one of the beauties of, of Seattle is all the water that we have around us, and we have so many more people who are using that water through, through power Bos or other individual, more Indivd more individualized crafts . We don't have the ability to be able to monitor, you know, like Washington and Lake Union and all of those things, and all of those areas . earlier this year, we were very fortunate to be Abe to save a family that had gotten gotten caught on the other side of, of I-90 in Lake Washington.",46,,
97,0.97,2818.849,2883.547,"It was really, we've really been really been relying very Heaviln heavily on kind of boaters to boat our water safety needs . So--those areas that allowed to be in more places, times of Seae or really out on the water . This this doesn't, this literally only funds very peak time periods for us, so Thursday through Sunday . It's not a full,, it's not a full component of what would be ideal, but it Juss just helps to meet the needs for for those kind of recreational, our weekend warriors who are out out on the water and taking advantage of, of some of Seattle's attributes . So it, they are, you know, they would be out during peak times, watching those people during the water safety events, just during during the summer Permax, and during what we consider the peak the peak hours of the summer.",46,,

100,0.97,2890.921,2908.071,"It's only the summer and only the weekends in the summer . What what about--does this mean Tht mean that, for those three Daysr however many hours of the Weeke, there will be a boat in Lake Washington, or will this boat be be in Lake Union and still have to be deployed?",48,,
101,0.97,2908.071,2910.274,So --,49,,
102,0.97,2910.274,2934.498,"I'll roll that to the chief, but it would be Thursday through Thursday through Sunday, so it D give us, basically, that for day day window of a little bit of ad weekend . So Thursday through Sunday, between Memorial day and and labor day . So just during tt during that very kind of high, high season peak . chief?",50,,
103,0.97,2934.498,2955.719,"So I'll give you--I know it's not an easy, clear-cut answer, but this would allow us to be able to deploy one in Lake Lake Union and one in Lake Washington . The reason why I Wot get a definitive answer is because depending on the vents, depending on things that are going on, we will deploy accord.",51,,
104,0.97,2955.719,2982.212,"Deploy accordingly . So if there's stuff that's, you know, like fourth of July, we've got more stuff in Lake Union . and have probably almost all of our boats, you know, focus in that Lake Union area . If there is, you know, during the first day f boating, there's a lot of stuff that's going on in Lake Washington, we'll probably Pushe of our boats into Lake Washington and really try to make sure that there's good, adequate coverage in those areas areas where there's more Boater.",51,,
105,0.97,2982.212,3011.775,"More boaters . So it, I don't Wat to give you 100% answer to say, yes, it's going to be, you know, know, one and one . It really is going to be based on what We'Vet going that Thursday through sun, what kind of events that are running . You know, we know that during, like, right in May, when when we first launch on boat season, that Lake Washington cut, or right in that cut, we want to make sure that we deploy deploy people in that area . We try to put people on both ends so we can get to, to Lake Union and Lake Washington very, very quickly, so.",51,,
106,0.97,3011.775,3036.7,"I appreciate that . You know, t will be good to have the extra coverage in the summertime . We also did get funding for some al buoys in the parks district, and and that--we advocated for that after lots of conversation with the recreational boating Association, who indicated to us that the existing buoys are too too small, especially for some of the really large boats that are starting to come into the B.",52,,
107,0.97,3036.7,3063.059,"We can't see them . They can't see the Signage that indicates the not speed, and there are also lots of new Boaterswho don't necessarily know the rules rules who sort of blow through there . and so the request made to our office was to at least try to get, you know, better Sie better Signage and bigger buoys out there so people can see Whae supposed to be seeing . So if we add to that your enforcement CAS enforcement capabilities, maybe we can see fewer incidents.",52,,
108,0.97,3063.059,3063.293,Yeah.,53,,
109,0.97,3063.293,3086.383,"Yeah . No, I couldn't agree more . Those Signage is, having a a little bit more robust, because you are seeing a lot bigger boats that are coming, especially during, you know, good weather . I mean, there's just, there's just a lot of boats out there, and those are pretty small, so we want to make to make sure we keep people's speed down in make it safer for everybody.",54,,
110,0.97,3086.383,3122.419,"The last thing else, chair, if I may, is I went out with somebody from the boating Association on a very large boat, I don't remember how big it was, and her comment to me was, my boat is too big to go the nod not speed that is, that is Requd is required . and so I have to go go a little bit faster . and my thought was, if your boat is too too big to go the required speed, then maybe we shouldn't be allowing such big boats in Te Bay . I don't know what we do about that, but something else to talk about later.",55,,
111,0.97,3122.419,3124.387,"Okay, thank you so much.",56,,

113,0.97,3128.158,3206.97,"Thank you . So the thing I'm struggling with here, because this has come up in the past during the period of time, chief, when you redeployed officers that were assigned to specialty units to general patrol, and I understand why you you did that, and you have to Prioritize the use of Resourcest I always understood that this issue of staffing harbor patrol was a function of, was a function of not having Sufficiet having sufficient numbers of ofs of officers to allow you to Prie to Prioritize deployment of offs of officers to that function, and that it's not a, it's not a money problem, it's not a issue of, Oh, you provide more money, we'll be able to assign more officers to this function . and, we, we can't, the Council can't make deployment decisions for you in our budget, for, for how you are going to assign your officers . So I am not understanding how this additional funding addresses that problem.",57,,
114,0.97,3206.97,3237.434,"So one of the things that we've been--because we do NOTE extra officers to, to be able to to put it on a permanent Basis.E using kind of a hybrid model, se training officers but, you know, know, might be on, say, normal patrol, but during the days off, off, they have the ability to work an overtime shift and Actuy be able to be a deployed into the harbor unit . and so that's what we've been doing for Specil events, such as fourth of July, Seafarer, et cetera . So when thy have time, we're not Crosstraining people, and also G able to utilize them on the boa.",58,,
115,0.97,3237.434,3272.502,"The boat . So this allows us just just to be able to use our Resos a little bit better . But when, specifically, to the point our staffing has been greatly Reducd in the harbor unit, and probably probably closer to around, I don't want to say the exact percentage, but just around 40% or so in reduction--because we we haven't been able to fill it because I'm robbing somebody ELE somebody else to actually fill that spot . So really, what we've we've had to do is just cross train our personnel, and allow them to, to be able to work overtime on an overtime basis to to fill those extra.",58,,
116,0.97,3272.502,3297.227,"Helpful . So $250,000 Investmt $250,000 investment does not Gue not guarantee $250,000 worth of hours for harbor patrol . that is is still a decision that you wil have to make while balancing other, other priorities, as, as you feel necessary under your, your charter authority to, to make those types of decisions.",59,,
117,0.97,3297.227,3315.545,"This does not mean that is a hard assignment of officers to that, to that function, but it is--it allows you to be more flexible with overtime officers,, overtime hours for officers.",59,,
118,0.97,3315.545,3345.408,"Correct . So it is--I'm not going to say, I can't say, Oh, M going to put five more officers from patrol in harbor unit permanently . that would not be the case . It's really about being flexible and having to utilize them in an overtime basis . and, you know, and people and people do want, because thet to eventually go to that unit, they would, you know, on their days off, they would be working at, so that does allow me to have that flexibility of Assignt when they're, when they're on their days off, so.",60,,

122,0.97,3352.949,3366.896,"You know, I will get that exact number . I believe we Havet boats total, and I, right now, I I think we've gotten a couple that were broken, and we've got them fixed . I think we're--I believe--let me just get you the exact number, rather than give you a number that just, I believe from recollection . so.",63,,
123,0.97,3366.896,3386.015,"And before, like, the Pandemc the pandemic was the, kind of the average deployment, about five or three, what was it? I TK I--can you remind me?",64,,
124,0.97,3386.015,3396.192,"That, I don't, I couldn't Tel you the exact--typically we, I I know that we've had--when we we had full staffing, it allowed it allowed us to be able to deploy multiple boats at any given time . and it allows us to also have a switch of training.",65,,
125,0.97,3396.192,3432.295,"So when we do a training session, you have to give so much time and separation for an officer to recover from that dive, and so it allows us to be able to do a lot more responsive responsive training to the issues that we are going to face face out in the field . So, for example, as a senior deputy Mayor mentioned, the I-90 Recovy I-90 recovery, if you have somebody dive the for that, you have to call must take them out of service after that, after that dive, because they need that, that recuperation time.",65,,

Many of these boats just haven't been maintained . Some were used Muche frequently than others . Some are are not functional as patrol boats .

134,0.97,3510.54,3526.389,"Is important .

139,0.97,3585.748,3618.414,"Yeah . I was just going to echo what the chief says about labor things . There are a number number of shared bodies of work between, well, not a number, but but one of the overlapping is, like, moving debris in the Wate, things like that, that both fire fire and police could do, but, you know, it does boil down to R issue, and so that is something that the city would have to negotiate with both unions, Ando that, that is something that continues to be a, a problem in that area.",73,,
140,0.97,3618.414,3656.419,"Okay . Well, I know that we will try to continue that conversation, but when I hear that this is really dedicated Tg to improve safety for weekend warriors, that, to me, does not mean going out and trying to find criminal elements out there there know if there is not a pair of investment with additional safety on the water, N I'm wondering how do we advance the conversation about Co-Response, or does it all have have to be put on hold until Fue negotiations occur? and I saw Councilmember Herbold, icy senior deputy Mayor--did you have something to add to this, Councilmember?",74,,
141,0.97,3656.419,3696.726,"I think I was just going to Y to put a finer point on your question, but I, I think you did did it . But just, there is an Od M.O . You between fire and police . There are, as Greg said, Greg said, overlapping issues that aren't criminal that some of those things could move over to SPD, or SFB . I think the question is, is since we discussed this last year, about the things that are overlapping that are not criminal in intent, intent, has there been an Efforo effort to, to move, to have that have that labor conversation, to to move some of those overlapping issues that are not related to criminal activities over to fire?",75,,
142,0.97,3696.726,3761.224,"Why don't I touch on that, and then--so--yes, we will, E will continue to have those conversations . I think that Wheu look in the budget book and you see where we are with our fire budget and fire resources, you'll see that they also have been pretty tapped in terms of R of their, their resource as well, particularly around overtime and, and staffing . So we're, we're doing our best with with the management of both departments . We'll continue to work on those . The other complaint that I, I did not mention earlier, but, you know, R know, Councilmember was bringing bringing it up, it is, it is one one of the things we've heard from our Houseboat immunity, is that they have had robberies OCR robberies occur on the houseboats, where people have BN have been--they have gotten ay via water, and we do utilize our our harbor patrol in those, in E particular cases . So it is a pretty unique Seattle situation.",76,,
143,0.97,3761.224,3803.933,". I know other cities would wonder how people steal from others and then get away by water, but it is something Thaty happens, and so our harbor Patrl harbor patrol is the best way Te able to manage those cases where where people pull up to a Houseboat, and, in a water Vehie water vehicle, and then, and then are able to also get away a water . But we will continue to explore the fire issues, but I think if you look for their budget book, you'll see that they've also been pretty extended in terms of their overtime hours and ability to deploy their water resources.",76,,

I don't want want to Belabor the slide, because I know we Havea lot more to get to, but just to respond to that, I don't think that anybody is saying there doesn't need to be a law enforcement component to the harbor patrol . I just think what's being underlined by some of my colleagues, and I agree with them, is that there's a significant scope of work that is more search and rescue, or water safety, things that wouldn't necessarily require a gun and badge . I don't, I don't know how common the, the Houseboat, getaway by boat Burgs boat burglaries are . But I would would imagine we could have a scope of work where we do have N have sworn harbor patrol personnel to respond to those Ks of situations, but then also Hae also have, you know, more search more search and rescue and water water safety oriented harbor COT harbor component that is complementary, but doesn't completely replace harbor Patro.",79,,
148,0.97,3876.439,3977.573,"Harbor patrol . I, I think with lots of these discussions, and it's--I'm just sort of forecasting my broader interest in alternative response, I think think we get bogged down in a Cn a conversation no one, I don't think any of us actually want to want to have on the Council, where our interest in exploring different ways to do certain work is construed as an entirely entirely replacing sworn service, and I don't think that's what it is . It's just a situation Whe we have a public safety Obligatn safety obligation . It is not tenable to respond to everything everything with sworn personnel right now, for the reasons Thate discussed, which calls into question how we diversified certain services, and I think we we ignore that part of the discussion way too much, and I would hope it would be a significant part of this budget discussion, and I would think that harbor patrol would be a potential area to look at doing, some of that work . It doesn't mean we want to get rid of the entire sworn component, but it means we can supplement it in a way where, you know, we can save from drowning while we're also G down the C burglars, I guess, I guess that's Pirates at that point, I don't know . But they, the point that I just, just would make is that I think you can have both of those services,, and finding a way to reconcile reconcile those things is what would be my, my focus, instead of, like, it's got to be all one one thing, or all the other thing . and I think that false dichotomy is distracting to Us.T us .

He emphasized emphasized through our Discussis around the side of that emergency response is always going to be the number one Prioy one priority . We currently operate under a Co-Response model with the fire Department to the benefit of the Communitye community . The police harbor Fay harbor facility, the location on on Lake Union places us in a position to respond more rapidly rapidly than the fire Departmen, so in the case of fire or rescue, urgent rescue, SPD is often Te first Responder to arrive . fire will follow, and obviously taker take over the, the medical Respe medical response aspect, but I think it is important to note that the location on Lake Union is critical to emergency response, whether fire or Polic.",85,,

164,0.97,4180.242,4209.305,"Thank you, chair . I know one of the issues with the slide that we received was the aspect of receiving data, because past practice has been, if an individual with like a response from harbor patrol, the practice practice is to call the direct E direct line to their office rather than calling 911. has this practice been changed, or is this the consistent practice being used today?",87,,
165,0.97,4209.305,4214.21,This practice has changed . SL officers are logging to 911 service for harbor patrol.,88,,

So there is still people that are going to be homeowners,, that this is the way they've done it, and they've had, you know, like, needed to use 911 service for, you know, 10 years, years, and then the officers are are now instructed to actually generate that call and then log to that call.",92,,

182,0.97,4441.737,4448.31,"We can get you an update--I I believe it's under 10 for medical, and I believe it's around 125 for religious . But some of them have Artie Returne.",100,,

So some people have retired early, or not early, but have Retired.O retired . So with that, that's the reason why we don't have definitive numbers of, if somebody says, Oh, I'm going to retire, I've done 25 years, it's, it's hard to determine whether it was a vaccine thing, or if it was an actual retirement, sobered",100,,

190,0.97,4531.994,4561.49,"All right, thank you, Madam chair . Greg Doss, central Staffe to talk with you about issues tt issues that we have identified for the SPD budget . The first issue is Unsworn staffing, and sort of at a high level so far this year, SPD has seen an Actul an actual average separation rate of about 15 trained officers per month . They are currently projecting that at the the end of the year, they will have seen 153 trained officers.",106,,
191,0.97,4561.49,4566.161,Officers separate . So how do they create those projections?,106,,
192,0.97,4566.161,4577.639,"Each month, they update their Sn their sworn staffing plan with Actuals . overriding the previous numbers that they had in their staffing plan for the prior mon.",106,,
193,0.97,4577.639,4603.065,"But what they do not do is to update the future months of projections . and so Consequently, if you look at the the '22, 2022 staffing plan, that's this year, what you'll see is that they've updated Alle last several months between now and, or between January of 2022 and August, to reflect that higher number of separations.",106,,
194,0.97,4603.065,4615.21,"But if you look for the next, I guess, few months, the plan we, we received shows September, October, November, and December.",106,,
195,0.97,4615.21,4634.963,"December . It's, it's, it's still still a very low rate . It's only only about six per month . and St so what--what that's obviously that's obviously showing us is it's about half of what we Woul- would--it's a little less Thaf of what we would expect to leave, given our experience so far this year . and it's actually actually less than what they're projecting to leave next year.",106,,
196,0.97,4634.963,4714.042,"Because if you look at the number of folks that they thinke going to leave on a monthly average basis next year, it's at it's about eight separations per per month . and so this is just a--an Artifact of the way that they do their, their staffing U, that they have built their budget, the 2023 budget, on the assumption that very few officers are going to leave this this fall, an average of six per per month, which is a pretty low low assumption, given what we have seen . and so one option that the Council could consider is, assuming that there would E a higher rate of separation this this fall, something may be more more consistent with what the Dt is assuming next year, let's say say eight separations per month,, and if the Council did that, N that, then that would mean that there would be sworn salary savings in the 2023 budget, because there would be fewer ofs fewer officers, about eight or so, fewer officers that would need salaries next year . and so the option there, would you go D and flip the slide? thank you.",106,,
197,0.97,4714.042,4737.666,"So the option there would be to reduce the 2023 budget by $1.1 million to reflect the fact that that the Council is assuming that this fall, there will be a higher separation rate than the Department is assuming . and that that next year, we will need fewer salary dollars for SPD Stf SPD staff . and option B would be be no change.",106,,
198,0.97,4737.666,4755.951,"All right . Wow . Wow . Okay . Ie I see Councilmember Lewis, Councilmember Peterson, just for for the sake of additional clarification, if there's something that was missing, or you need to add?",107,,
199,0.97,4755.951,4805.5,"Yes . Thank you for the Oppory the opportunity . I just wanted O flag that there is a concern from the executive on this Propl this proposal . often, we have to, as we have experienced this year, and you all have had to deal with, we do need to use the the salary savings to pay for additional overtime, because the the fewer officers we have, the more we have to ask those on their days off to come in to cover those shifts . and so, not to impute any math here, or this or this option, it would, in real terms, reduce the ability of the police Department to Depy officers, because we wouldn't he that overtime available to meet those needs, and so that's just an added impact of this option.",108,,
200,0.97,4805.5,4810.639,Okay . I want to be clear that that this is not a proposal . We are asking central staff to do an independent analysis for us.,109,,
201,0.97,4810.639,4837.032,"Thank you . and this is an opportunity for us to see that independent analysis . We've had the chance to see the proposal as outlined in the proposed budget . Obviously, there will be be concerns about items that might not align 100% . We get that . But want to make sure Thae that we reserve the chance to hear any technical feedback for additional input in these, in these times . So thank you for sharing that perspective, and we'll go over to Councilmember Lewis.",110,,
202,0.97,4837.032,4861.823,"Thank you, and, Greg, I don' W if this is a question for you or or for the Department, but just to--you know, we had this Disn everybody about expected attrition rates, and what we should budget to, and there's as there's always more ambitious ts ambitious targets that are suggested by the executives.",111,,
203,0.97,4861.823,4882.41,"This time around, are these NUMS informed by projections based Oe hiring and retention incentives that the executive is going to be offering, or some other considerations that might make s cycle materially different in terms of the anticipated Separas anticipated separations than the the past couple of years?",111,,
204,0.97,4882.41,4915.61,"Well, I think that in terms of the new hires, that the Exece would, would say that they Certy hope that the bonuses, the streamlined recruiting, additional work, all of those things would impact the new higher side, and that they could--that's why I have this table table appear for you . They could could move from, if you look At2 at 2022, projected year and hires from 68 this year to 120 next year . So, certainly, they hope that the recruitment and retention bill will impact that.",112,,
205,0.97,4915.61,4928.923,"That number . in terms of reducing the separations from the 153 number down to 105, there's not a lot in the recruitment and retention bill that would affect separations O.",112,,
206,0.97,4928.923,4982.243,"Or retention . There is an $800,000 item for a leadership Y leadership Academy that falls under the retention initiative Y initiative category, and I'm quite sure that SPD is doing its its own things for retention, a, of course, there's also Bargaing going on with the Union, and retention is likely a subject there, too . But in terms of Sucs of success in, in keeping folks there, that is, that is very difficult to predict, and that s why, I think, SPD, when they revise their staffing plan, REVISES past months on separation, but is reluctant to, to, to change the forward Projes as they're moving along . of course, they have to do it when they're eating together an annual budget . They have to assume some number, and, in this this case, they assumed 105.",112,,

211,0.97,4993.121,4993.321,Well?,115,,
212,0.97,4993.321,5053.548,"I think that Greg covered well some of the things that are are different from what we were covering . If you look at Separas at separations as a percentage of the overall number of offices of officers, there does reach a point of, kind of, hopefully diminishing returns on separations that we have fewer people to separate from a smaller number . and so we are very much working recruitment and retention plan that will hopefully not see our numbers drop too far below from what they are now . So if you look ATU know, where we net out on the assumptions overall, we are really hoping to have ended the, the, the attrition to be able to to recruit up through next, through next year, beginning Thh next year . seeing positive Gaing forward . and so if you look at E number of separations and the number of ads, we are really hog to not have attrition in those.",116,,
213,0.97,5053.548,5056.985,Those numbers.,116,,
214,0.97,5056.985,5061.89,"Okay . Councilmember Lewis, any other questions?",117,,

216,0.97,5062.991,5065.627,Okay . Thanks . Councilmember Herbold.,119,,
217,0.97,5065.627,5081.843,"Thank you . Just wondering, IA is a third option to sort of Apy your same logic here, to 2023 as as you do for 2022, or is that identified as a completely separate issue?",120,,
218,0.97,5081.843,5089.184,"It is not identified as a separate issue, and it could be a third option, an option C.",121,,
219,0.97,5089.184,5157.252,"Sort of the option that is before you now is to take that 153 number, which is, you know, in the separations on 2022, and you would be moving that up effectively to 161. and then that, that would be, that's then before you . What that does is it it also gives the flexibility, if you don't actually see 161 in in 2022, then you still may accrue the savings in 2023 s, if if there are not 120 hires made,, or if there are more than 105 separations . So it kind of still still gets you there either way,, even if you, even if you Wereo were to assume that in 2022, or if you were to assume that in 2023, sort of, the option C Thae talking about . the benefit of doing 2022 is that it gets you a you a full year of that savings, that savings, and it gets you a higher dollar amount . It gets you the 1.1 million.",121,,
220,0.97,5157.252,5168.396,"I wanted to clarify, my, my idea of an option three, I'm Asg I'm asking as an additive option, not as a substitution.",122,,
221,0.97,5168.396,5181.476,"I'm just wondering, is there a D a need, or would there be a benefit of Rightsizing the separation estimate for the out years as well as for this year?",122,,
222,0.97,5181.476,5202.564,"Yeah . and so that is something that the Council has,, by choice, done in the last two years . They have taken the executives sworn staffing plan, D plan, and taken the number of hires, and assumed the same number of separations . and last year, that was effectively 125 s 125 hires and 125 separations.",123,,
223,0.97,5202.564,5226.588,"And, as you can see, in 2022, nowhere near 125 hires, and well well over 125 separations . In 2021, you had the same kind of order of magnitude . So there ISA precedent for, for doing both options, as you're suggesting.",123,,
224,0.97,5226.588,5250.378,"Sort of the, the balance there is what the deputy Mayor is bringing up . At what point in time do they retirements and separations start to fall off, if they do? and if you assume a greater number, and they do STAT falling off, you'll be in a position halfway through the Yer of potentially having to add money.",123,,
225,0.97,5250.378,5252.38,Understood . Okay . Thank you.,124,,
226,0.97,5252.38,5324.385,"As long as I have the floor here for a second, I'd love to O address director Ding lease comment . It is true that by cutting the money for the Vacans the vacancies in 2022, this option a that I have resented, you would not leave that money available in overtime next yeard year . and, by not having the Moy available in overtime, the Department would not have that money available for extra emphasis patrols, more patrol an patrol Augmentation, and they would be fewer staff . so that, that is certainly something to R to consider in the bigger Pictue bigger picture . They have had sworn staffing separations at the much higher rate in the last last couple years, and a number of those savings have gone Intoh overtime as well as internal needs for the Department, Thinge things like the s PMA contract t that we'll, we'll talk about here in a minute.",125,,
227,0.97,5324.385,5351.279,"Can ask a question? I'm sorry, colleagues, I see your hands . But does that mean that there is an assumption being Mae within the proposed budget that's come down that there is Y is already an underestimate on the number of overtime hours that will be needed next year?",126,,
228,0.97,5352.046,5414.075,"I, I can't speak for the executive on whether or not they they think there is an underestimate of the number of overtime hours . I think that what the, what they were saying is that if there are eight Fewef fewer staff, and the Council takes the salary savings, that that exact dollar amount, $1.1 million, will not be available in overtime to, to--for patrol patrol Augmentation, or for other overtime uses that might be able to balance out not having those eight officers . and that would be different than Te than the state of the 2023 proposed budget as it was sent to the Council . and what I'm suggesting is that in the big picture of SPD's salary savings over the last couple years, there's a sort of been enough to to go around for overtime and Fr and for other things that the Dt wanted to spend on . that may or may not be the case next year.",127,,

I'm concerned Abot concerned about, as the CBO director mentioned, not having enough for overtime that we'll need . part of the separations, based on exit interviews, is that the officers don't feel supported .

This budget assumes that we're permanently G permanently removing 80 officers that will provide $11 million to be used for general Fund, you you know, going forward, because because those positions are gone .

So, you know, certainly, public safety is one part of what we are obligated tt in this city, but it's not the only part, and it is not even the first thing mentioned in the the city charter . health is the first thing mentioned . So I think it's important for us to kind of Recalibrate our expectations about how we need to serve our community, and Acke and acknowledge that, especially especially right now, when we he we have so many extraordinarily vulnerable people on our streets, there are things we should be doing to serve them . things that that the police Department cannot do .

It's also going to come from things like adequately compensating and paying our social service providers who are taking people off the streets and keeping Thef the streets in places where they're getting care and assistance and help, instead of being in a position where they can be potential victims of violence, which we've seen happen time and time again . Just just to digress a little bit more, because I, I know we're, E we're, we're pressed, but to flag my interest in some future discussions, I would really like like us to figure out how we can can make it budget more coordination between a lot of the different groups we have out out in the public, who are Doinc safety work, but it's not necessarily as coordinated as it it could be .

When I look at Appendix 4 in your materials, Table 1, can you tell me a little bit more about how the shifts in allocation of patrol personnel and Nonperson--what is the distinction there that we we should take away from that Appendix, given the total number total number of personnel that we have? waiting at the Departm?",153,,

282,0.97,6329.723,6384.377,"And so the take away from, I think the take away from this is, this shifting between the various categories of police Wok police work, relative to the resources that they had in 2020,, and the resources that they have now, and sort of at a Highl high level, you know, I think wt most folks know is that the Seattle police Department has attempted to make sure that then they maintain response times and and make sure that they keep staffed as much as possible Patl response . and so, sort of above the line in patrol personnel, that has stayed relatively constant, or has grown, and then and then below the line of Non-Patrol personnel, you can se that those categories of sworn personnel have decreased since the staffing shortage has begun.",154,,

288,0.97,6437.798,6459.453,"Around . over the, over the long haul, what you're seeing is the investigations, if you look at E at the 2020, and you see investigative and specialty units, and specialty units are the ones where you're going to have canine and bomb . and, and the various types of--and harbor, and various other types of specialty units .

289,0.97,6459.453,6476.67,"35% . and now, that shifted, and you have, as a percentage of the the Department ski Resorts, fewer people in investigations and specialty and more people in in patrol . so that, that's a reflection of how the Department Department is allocating its resources now.",156,,

So, I really am hoping that we--and focus our efforts on--on--trying to identify things that we know are effective in both gun violence prevention and stressing the need to reduce recurring cycles of gun Violenc.",169,,

366,0.97,7975.467,7977.369,The salary savings proviso.,175,,
367,0.97,7977.369,8001.193,"The 2022--the 2022 adopted budget has a salary savings proviso that restricts SPD's ability to extend its salary savings without a future lift by by the Council .

372,0.97,8057.115,8123.782,"Retention activities . So, with that as an update, central staff and SPD at the time said that the only way that SPD would make its budget at the end of the year is if that salary savings proviso was lifted so that SPD would have access to all of its salary savings to be able to cover those items that I just mentioned . There was, attached to the central staff memo, a rather detailed report by SPD showing how they had spent the E the three some million in overtime funding, as well as some of the other items that I covered . So now, now we are at that point . The Council is at that point in the year where they would need to release the salary savings proviso in the year end supplemental . So, that is the decision before you, is to release--Patty if you could could flip one more . The first option would be to release that proviso and allow the Department to spend its salary savings on those items that I mentioned the the second would be no change.",175,,
373,0.97,8123.782,8139.03,"The only thing I would let the committee know is that without a a lift of that proviso, the DEPT the Department would--would incur an exception . would not make their budget this year . so that's all I had on this slide.",175,,

I continue to be frustrated by the excuse of what departments consider to bee be appropriate for budget exceptions ordinance . We've done done a lot in the last few years years to try to temper down or clampdown on the use of budget s budget exceptions as a way to just Backfill funding that has already been spent . specific to SPD, we've had a lot of conversations about spending within the limits that they have have been given . is there any additional information that could round out what is being considered extraordinary budgeting needs, and I would Noe not assume that overtime is being considered in this extraordinary budgeting need given that--that is something that can be predicted and we also are still, unfortunately, in a position of trying to, I'Me that the executive will agree with me, trying to figure out how we can move more officers away from special events that are requiring a lot of overtime hours right now . So, that effort effort has been very Frustratin, but I just want us to continue O continue to move in a position that doesn't assume that budgets budget exceptions ordinances will be passed . I'm going to GUS to guess what the executive would say, is that this is Beind being proposed so that you don't don't have to ask for an exceptions ordinance . But again, again, I want to make sure that, that we, when budgets are allocated, the departments are staying within those budgets, unless it's truly extraordinary.",176,,

378,0.97,8260.585,8306.498,"I just have a question about our prior adjustment to the project proviso . which my recollection is, although Admity although admittedly it is fuzzy, we did earlier this year, I think I had to take two tries at at it to do so successfully . But but it was designed to allow SPD to use its salary savings for s for items that the council agreed were priorities . If you could remind us, Greg, the Amou, the amount, and the items that that was for . I just want to make sure there's not duplication in what we are hearing now.",177,,

387,0.97,8420.712,8431.523,$10 million . Why is it--why is one of the uses of that the Ret the recruitment and retention element?,181,,

So, THP the top bullet there, ordinance, ordinance 126654, I should Havet have put that the 1.8 million, all I'm trying to say is that BG by lifting the entire proviso--what you had done in the legislation was authorize up to 1.8 million . by lifting the entire proviso, crossing it out of the budget, getting rid of I, of it, it will allow them to spend their salary savings on all four of these bullets . by doing that, they can stay in BA.",182,,
389,0.97,8477.836,8487.111,"In balance . what they have here with these four bullets, if you were to add in the 1.8 that I left out there on the top, would would be $10 million worth of N.",182,,

392,0.97,8502.894,8535.093,"You did, you gave them . You released 1.8 million, so that immediately gave them 1.8 million of salary savings Authoy savings authority to spend . and now they need the rest . So, instead of giving them specific Úline item authority for everything else they need, the suggestion here is just that you you would eliminate the proviso and let them spend the entirety of their salary savings to balance their budget, which is about--I mean it is for these things.",184,,
393,0.97,8535.093,8541.499,Let's have a clarification from the director and then we are going to close this out.,185,,
394,0.97,8541.499,8556.948,"Great, thank you . I'll try to to make it quick . Greg has done incredible analysis, as per usual . Thank you, Greg . We want to be really clear that this will--doing this will allow us us to avoid budget exceptions.",186,,
395,0.97,8556.948,8607.599,"This is not--this is not for lack of effort or for lack of transparency . We transmitted Tht the budget in September, and we let you all know in sort of mid-September that this was likely to be coming . We have been working a lot throughout the year, but what happens is there's a direct relationship to to the staffing level and the overtime usage . So, I just want to make sure I drive that home for everybody because the fewer officers we have the more we have to rely on overtime . This isn't going to be an issue that goes away for us . So what we Hae we have in the 2023 proposed budget is a plan . If we were to get that plan wrong, by one off, one officer, or 12 officers . We are going to need to adjust the amount between salaries and Ove.",186,,

So those two things are related, and I just want to make sure that that part part is clear, and I'm sorry if we have been unclear up until now . on that, but those two pieces are--they are two sides sides of the same coin . because of the proviso, we have had to come to you to get that lifted to be able to spend it on the other side of that coin . So, that I think is what is newer about this conversation is because of how tightly that is written . that's why you are seeing it here . typically they would have said we are down on staffing so we are going to have have to spend it on overtime, and it wouldn't have necessarily necessarily been the subject of conversation . I hope that that helps clarify.",186,,

401,0.97,8685.443,8701.759,"Because we are hiring so many people, that's the piece I don't don't understand .

Nothing has changed on those . So there's no more money needed for the recruitment and retention plan, and it is still the case that we are using salary savings instead of a planning reserves to handle this FEMA contract issue . So none of of that part has changed . I think what Greg is endeavoring to do here is show you the full picture of how although salary savings have gone to use in this this year, so it just rounds out out that 3 million at the bottom bottom is really rounding out the use.",191,,

I want to be clear, this is not to do with our--has nothing to do with our Dispatchers who continue to work work extremely hard and manage a a significant amount of mandatory overtime . This is a Long-Standing issue about the Cy the city's Prioritization of Fug of funding a sufficient number of Dispatchers . that 2016 staffing analysis of the 911 call center identify that staffing levels were insufficient to meet call volume volume and concluded that based on its then current volume, that that the center should have 169.",199,,

432,0.97,9010.668,9042.233,"To you . I know the last session went a little long . I'm hoping that we have so completely Vetted this with Council staff that there won't be any questions and we will get you all out of here on time . We'll see . all right, to go through the slides pretty quickly here, following the template that you guys established for us . wanted to hit just some of the highlights here on our first slide here . You can see with the the forecast that we are Comingt coming out for the city budget deficits and the Revenuedeficit.",204,,
433,0.97,9042.233,9068.225,"Revenue deficits . This quickly kind of shows the change for this year that we adopted . Then, then, the proposed cuts for the next two years . The subsequent slides will kind of go through and talk about where those cuts are coming from . It's a smaller budget, the Department's budget as you can see $22 million is what was adopted for this year.",204,,
434,0.97,9068.225,9129.987,"With the cuts, most of those cuts came through as Councilmember Herbold talked about . The 26 I believe additional Ftes that were proposed and authorized last Yer last year by this Committee . The the discussion of course at that that time was that we were to try to find a way to fill most of our--as many of our Currens current vacancies before Council Council would authorize--I don't think there is a proviso, but before you would authorize the additional positions . We have put all of our efforts into into hiring, and there will be--there is a graph coming up on on a slide later that shows that that we are projected to probably close within 90+ Percet 90+ percent of our authorized staffing levels by the end of the year . So, I can't call out my team big enough for the recruiting efforts that they have done . to both slow down the the attrition, and to bring new people on board . So, it's again, again, huge effort by the team.",204,,
435,0.97,9129.987,9152.076,"Next slide please . So, on Hee on here, this is--we are getting to the cuts . citywide as citywide adjustments for standard cost changes . The annual wage increases . You are quite familiar with these . You have probably seen these on some some of the other departments lives . pretty standard stuff.",205,,
436,0.97,9152.076,9228.385,"Number three is the cares protocol system . This is the system that public safety and that you guys then subsequently authorized last year . This is the protocol system to help us, and this was kind of one of the building blocks for any kind of alternative response . that we needed to have this, or wanted to have this in place to help 911 call takers with their Triag their Triaging so they are asking consistent, bias free questioning . that feeds back into quality assurance and Whatnot . that should we identify alternative response resources, either in the community or that that we designed them, that this this protocol system would allow allow her our Dispatchers to consistently ask the same and right questions to confirm that those resources are the best three--the best thing to solve solve a potential problem . So, let's see here . any questions on on this slide? okay . just as a quick NOTE on that last one, sorry about that . part of this s this was Councilmember Lewis' amendment for the two employees.",205,,

439,0.97,9248.105,9299.39,"Slide please . Okay, one of the things that we had asked for, when you guys directed us to start this new Department in 2020, and then of course it's launch in June of last year . One one of the things that we had asked for last year, was to--and regarding the study that Councilmember Herbold talked about, the 2016 Federal Engineering/Kimball report . a lot of the assumptions in that report for staffing, staffing N, staffing needs, were based on the 911 still being a division within Seattle police Department . We wanted to do a little refresh on a portion of that study to ascertain, since it was now its own independent Department . What would have Chad have changed and there was conclusions from that initial 2016, and then the updated 2018.",205,,
440,0.97,9299.39,9309.066,"2018 report . This $150, or I'm sorry the 150,000 here would have helped us refresh what Othr what other back end staff do we.",205,,

442,0.97,9331.288,9369.827,"As far as trying to identify based on our experiences in the year and a half since we have been up and running . Some of our our additional needs . number Fie number five is the point that Councilmember Herbold was just talking about . These are the additional 26 positions . This Ie is where the majority as you can can see from the numbers, of Cscc's proposed budget cuts are are coming from . number six, is an assumed vacancy rate . What that amounted to is four Ftes.",205,,
443,0.97,9369.827,9371.595,We were reserving two Superviso.,205,,
444,0.97,9371.595,9380.237,"Supervisor positions . two of what we call our dispatcher three positions . dispatcher threes are kind of a training, call taker, radio type element.",205,,
445,0.97,9380.237,9390.447,"That we have . The bulk of the work that we need in the Department is of course in the 911 answering, and then work in the radio . The dispatcher Posit.",205,,
446,0.97,9390.447,9397.821,Dispatcher positions . We felt that those positions would have the least negative impact . for the Department.,205,,

448,0.97,9410.067,9444.434,"Thank you, Madam chair . a point of clarification on the description here for item 4. the the need for a staffing study was not cited in the 2022 adopted budget . The description of the body of work in the 2022 adopted budget for which funding funding was provided was a technical and operational study to help the Cscc identify gaps as a newly independent Department, and plan for the integration of Nonuniformed and/or alternative methods of D.",207,,
449,0.97,9444.434,9460.751,"Of dispatch . So I think that chief and I feel similarly that a staffing study should be Perf, be performed, but this additional body of work was Ided was identified and funding is now being removed for it . that's that's all.",207,,
450,0.97,9460.751,9467.024,"Okay, that's very helpful . D, helpful . director, do we call you director or chief?",208,,

456,0.97,9478.769,9493.717,"No, she is correct . Some of those missing staffing positions positions was part of it . It's kind of like, again it was a Reh a refresh for the initial study which covered all kinds of Operl of operational considerations, staffing considerations.",212,,
457,0.97,9493.717,9495.319,"Hardware, software type stuff.",212,,
458,0.97,9495.319,9498.956,Her point is spot on.,212,,
459,0.97,9498.956,9504.761,Excellent . Let me just take a a quick question from Councilmember Herbold.,213,,
460,0.97,9504.761,9519.376,"How does the number 279,000 relate to a reduction in 26 Ftes? that doesn't seem to Corr.",214,,
461,0.97,9519.376,9532.222,"To correspond . It seems like 26 Ftes would be a couple of million dollars . not quite sure how we are getting to--879,000.",214,,
462,0.97,9532.222,9549.006,"Okay . You said 279, you meant meant the 879,000. for that I'm going to probably punt to my Finance director, Tommy . are you you able to help with that one?",215,,
463,0.97,9549.006,9554.878,"Yeah, absolutely and you can correct me if I'm wrong on this.",216,,
464,0.97,9554.878,9577.367,"I handle all the principal accounting functions and physical functions here . When the counselor did the amendment to add the 26 positions, they expected that we would not be able to hire for all of those in in this year . so they planned on on finding only 879,000, which at the time was supposed to be for 13 positions . looking at the the math that is more like eight eight positions, which is another number tossed around later in the 2022 budget for us.",216,,
465,0.97,9577.367,9577.534,Us.,216,,
466,0.97,9577.534,9585.809,I think we budgeted for 2022 with the understanding it wouldn't be a four-year of FTE.,217,,
467,0.97,9585.809,9596.353,"If that was an ongoing commitment, it would be greater in 2023 and 2024 because we Werg that those positions would be hired in 2022.",217,,
468,0.97,9596.353,9602.826,Let me see if we have something to add to this . would you like to add something?,218,,
469,0.97,9602.826,9612.936,"Yes, thank you very much . The the 879,020 22 reflected an Assn an assumption that there would be 13 positions filled at Midye.",219,,
470,0.97,9612.936,9619.042,"At midyear . understanding, this is an average . Some of them would take less time to fill.",219,,
471,0.97,9619.042,9621.478,Some of them would take longer.,219,,
472,0.97,9621.478,9633.19,"But with 13 positions filled at the end of 2022, we should see a a reduction in 2023 of the four year cost, which is closer to 1.9 million.",219,,
473,0.97,9633.19,9638.428,Thank you.,220,,
474,0.97,9638.428,9641.999,"Yeah, thank you Ma'am for th.",221,,
475,0.97,9641.999,9654.011,"For that . It's reminding me of the sequencing that we did . But, is the full amount that you just Referenced noted in the but the budget, Anne?",221,,
476,0.97,9654.011,9662.285,I don't believe it is Referenced in the budget because the 2022 adopted budget would not have Referenced 2023.,222,,

478,0.97,9665.789,9687.944,"Okay . again, I remember the N the discussion with you guys last year was that you definitely wanted to see us fill fill the existing pockets before before we started tapping into those . so . next page please . So these items--so the number Sen number seven is simply just a T.",224,,
479,0.97,9687.944,9690.347,A transfer . from us over to SPD.,224,,

482,0.97,9705.796,9709.733,But what it was as it had to do do more with sign language Interpreters for patrol units.,224,,
483,0.97,9709.733,9723.013,"Out in the field . So when the Department was created, this was was actually kind of one of those line items that accidentally got transferred over with us . We are simply just just transferring it back . They still use the service, but again again it has nothing to do with Cscc.",224,,
484,0.97,9723.013,9725.348,One second.,225,,
485,0.97,9725.348,9730.253,"Let me double check, are we on slide number four?",226,,

488,0.97,9734.157,9735.425,Just double checking.,228,,
489,0.97,9735.425,9743.033,"Number eight, and number eight and number nine were actually both kind of connected.",229,,
490,0.97,9743.033,9771.762,"Connected . one of the things that we identified earlier was that there were some Disconnects between the computer aided dispatching software that Cscc uses to take, categorize and record all the calls, and Seattle police Department's records management system . and fire Department's records management system . I'll talk to the first one, Cscc to SPD software interface improvements.",229,,
491,0.97,9771.762,9799.089,"Right now there's a lot of broken Connectivity between Agan the CAD and the records management system . police officers are having to, when they are looking up information, they are having to look it up actually in their patrol cars and multiple locations . The Rms and the CAD system . What this funding sought to do is fix those links . so that the information is all getting past appropriately over to SPD and their records management system.",229,,
492,0.97,9799.089,9821.178,"Excuse me . The second one is a similar connection over to fire Department's records management system . fire, the reason that they need to talk to fire' is M, is management, or records management system is that fire Department has a much more Accue more accurate and updated Database that includes what we call a lot of the commonplace N.",229,,
493,0.97,9821.178,9840.297,"Commonplace names . around Seattle, that's done by firefighters doing their annual safety inspections, and then correcting and updating that data . that process is going on all the time, every day, year-round throughout the city so that when a police dispatcher dispatcher or Cscc dispatcher, sorry, somebody called 911 and says I'm in front of McDonald's.",229,,
494,0.97,9840.297,9841.698,Mcdonald's . I don't know an add.,229,,
495,0.97,9841.698,9889.012,"An address . that would enable the dispatcher to look at Mcdons at McDonald's and find the 10, 20 McDonald's that are in the city and start to try to narrow it down . Cscc and previously SPD didn't really have a good mechanism to keep updating that Database based on using the McDonald's example that it used to be at this address . for whatever reason, this one flows down but a new one opened somewhere else . This funding here was going to be able to connect to that system within the fire Department' aside so that 911 Dispatchers would be able to get again real-time commonplace names . parks, restaurants, all of that kind of kind of stuff . any questions on this slide?",229,,
496,0.97,9889.012,9893.216,I don't see any here.,230,,
497,0.97,9893.216,9930.854,"Okay, next slide please . This this graph just kind of shows what I was just talking about as as far as how hard the team was working on recruiting and getting new people on board . You you can see that we kind of hit bottom early, late winter, early early spring this year . We had talked about that last year and many of you may recall that the exodus was underway . We were trying to hire, but there were definitely people leaving faster faster than they were coming . So so this kind of shows that throughout the year, that again, we have been taking advantage of everything we can to keep and and hire new people . We are on.",231,,
498,0.97,9930.854,9961.084,"On track .

502,0.97,9982.372,9987.877,Just wanting to get the number in my head again . What is is the authorized FTE count?,233,,
503,0.97,9987.877,10008.665,"So, that was with the minus the four vacancies that we are G are maintaining on I believe it was slide three . that would Giv, give us, I'm calling it up here.",234,,

506,0.97,10030.053,10049.806,All right and maybe one . I'm I'm not understanding how that number is relating to the number number that I have in my notes for 2023 of only 113 Ftes . call takers and Dispatchers . 113 is the number I have in my notes.,236,,
507,0.97,10049.806,10067.791,"113, Councilmember, is the number of call taker and dispatcher positions . that the Csdc would have in 2023 under this proposal . But there are other positions at the Csdc.",237,,

I think that there were 10 call takers and Dispatcs and Dispatchers in the group of 13 positions that were funded in in 2022. that would mean that there are currently 123, but I will confirm this and get back to you.",239,,
