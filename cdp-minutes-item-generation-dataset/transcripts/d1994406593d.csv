34,0.97,104.771,106.172,Thank you so much.,28,,
35,0.97,106.172,123.49,"Councilmembers before we go ahead and start this morning's meeting, we need to address the issues related to suspension of the rules so the Council rules are silent on allowing electronic participation at Council briefing meetings.",28,,
36,0.97,123.49,139.672,"To continue participating Remeeting I am going to move to suspend the Council rules through June 17th, 2020, to allow this meeting to occur while participating through electronic means.",28,,
37,0.97,139.672,141.207,Is there any objection?,28,,
38,0.97,141.207,155.588,"Hearing no objection, the Council rules are suspended and Council briefing meetings will continue to be held with Councilmembers participating electronically through June 17th, 2020.",28,,
39,0.97,155.588,162.862,"If there is no objection, the minutes of May 26th, 2020 will be adopted.",28,,
40,0.97,162.862,168.101,"Hearing no objection, the minutes are adopted.",28,,
41,0.97,168.101,194.627,"Just really quickly before we begin today's substantive conversation of issues, I wanted to make sure that folks knew at the top of today's agenda that the original proclamation 20-28 related to the open public meetings Act and portions of the public records act as well has been extended, but it has been extended only through June 17th of 2020.",28,,
42,0.97,194.627,240.907,"I want to express my gratitude to the governor's office and his team and to the Association of Washington cities and others for Chiming in on that conversation and consistent with the advocacy we have Championing out of my office related to some flexibility on proclamation 20-28, we were able to receive a new proclamation that was not only extended but revised to allow for a higher level of flexibility in allowing local agencies who are subject to the--to consider additional matters that are not just strictly within the construct of the Covid-19 response.",28,,
43,0.97,240.907,261.628,"So we, through that proclamation 20-28.4 are able now to consider matters that the city council would normally consider, but we are still required to do that by providing a remote tool like the ones we are using now.",28,,
44,0.97,261.628,273.806,"So I just wanted to sort of read some of the language from that proclamation to make sure folks understood the parameters of that and the proclamation read, quote, we intend this order to be the Superseding order on this topic.",28,,
45,0.97,273.806,281.814,We intended to allow the government's greater flexibility in the content of their Opma meetings by removing that limitation.,28,,
46,0.97,281.814,288.021,The deeper we get into this emergency the harder it is for governments to tackle the business we need to address.,28,,
47,0.97,288.021,317.283,At this juncture we will continue through the middle of June to do remote meetings and I am really grateful that 20-28 was revised in a way that allows us to do our business as normal with the understanding that we are still required to provide the public with a means to view our public meetings and really grateful that now this proclamation takes into account that this technological tool is sufficient for us to continue to move forward.,28,,
48,0.97,317.283,328.628,So happy to answer any questions about that particular piece if folks have any questions or want to make any comments.,28,,
49,0.97,328.628,335.034,Any questions or comments on that?,28,,
50,0.97,335.034,335.668,"Councilmember Pedersen, please.",28,,
51,0.97,335.668,342.175,I wanted to thank you for that advocacy effort with Olympia.,29,,
52,0.97,342.175,343.843,Really appreciate that.,29,,
53,0.97,343.843,345.778,"Thank you, Councilmember.",30,,
54,0.97,345.778,354.887,Wanted to also thank Councilmember Mosqueda who is helping me with--for continuing to represent our interests there.,30,,
55,0.97,354.887,369.502,"Of course we only have this proclamation in place for another two weeks, but I am confident that we will continue to be able to figure out how our operations should roll out in the context of Covid-19 and the pandemic.",30,,
56,0.97,369.502,375.308,"I'm going to go ahead and move us through our meeting, colleagues.",30,,
57,0.97,375.308,390.223,"I want to start off at the top of the agenda by acknowledging that today we start this meeting with a rather heavy, heavy heart and heavy mind.",30,,
58,0.97,390.223,409.809,We know that across the country and certainly here in Seattle we saw a weekend of demonstrations and protests across the nation that were Spurn by the latest loss of black life and that is the life of George Floyd.,30,,
59,0.97,409.809,422.722,"Many of you, I'm sure, have seen the Video in which Mr.",30,,
60,0.97,422.722,460.993,"Floyd uses his last breath to call for his mother . It is a difficult moment for many of us, whether you're a mother or not, and I know that many people in our city and across the country are feeling the loss as though it was their own, and that has resulted in a lot of anger and a lot of frustration that is not new to our communities and particularly to communities of color.",30,,
61,0.97,460.993,468.401,"The reality is, is that what we have seen out on the streets in Seattle are a product of that frustration.",30,,
62,0.97,468.401,484.35,"It is a product of years of oppression, of being left out of economic systems, of being subjected to violence in our own communities, in having fear of the very thing that is supposed to be there to protect you.",30,,
63,0.97,484.35,508.207,"And so when we have this conversation that I know we are going to have here on zoom, as leaders of our city, I call on us to be respectful and compassionate of each other, to understand that what our community wants right now is unity and unity doesn't mean that we deny frustration.",30,,
64,0.97,508.207,513.279,It doesn't mean that we ignore the realities of the pain and the grief.,30,,
65,0.97,513.279,543.509,"It does mean that we call upon each other as leaders and as members of our community to stand together, to help our community grieve and to help chart forward a path of healing and understanding and that is not an easy task for anybody to do, and I sit here thinking of the fact that my own personal life has been impacted by police violence.",30,,
66,0.97,543.509,549.282,I have lost family members to police violence.,30,,
67,0.97,549.282,558.858,I have been faced with the reality of having a younger brother who has called the police only to have a gun pulled out on him when he was calling for help.,30,,
68,0.97,558.858,563.696,And I am grateful every day that he is still alive today in spite of that situation.,30,,
69,0.97,563.696,567.199,So this is personal to many of us.,30,,
70,0.97,567.199,571.337,And many of us are survivors of this system of oppression.,30,,
71,0.97,571.337,590.389,And what I saw this weekend was a manifestation of that frustration and that anger and it's up to us to figure out how we can express our frustration in a way that will have systemic change and there's a lot of different ways that can look and a lot of different shapes that that can take.,30,,
72,0.97,590.389,609.442,"And I just hope that we can encourage each other to hold each other in community, to not subject each other to additional acts of violence and trauma and to hold those who do engage in violence, especially if they have a badge, accountable for that violence.",30,,
73,0.97,609.442,647.013,"And I believe we have a system in place in large part because of the leadership of many members in the community, in place right now in the city of Seattle, through our police accountability system that we passed in 2017 that was community driven and I have confidence in that system to be able to have an investigation and to Dole out justice as appropriate in the context of Seattle, and this massive experience that we are going through here in our own city is going to be a stress test for that system.",30,,
74,0.97,647.013,647.513,And I acknowledge that.,30,,
75,0.97,647.513,662.261,"And it will be up to us and in particular our public safety chair, Councilmember Herbold to lead us what will be an extraordinary test of our system of accountability that is civilian led.",30,,
76,0.97,662.261,684.683,I am grateful for all of the people who have worked tirelessly over the years and have been part of many civil rights movements to get us to where we are at now and I hope that we can all continue to work together to hold those in power accountable and that includes us.,30,,
77,0.97,684.683,700.132,I want to end my remarks by acknowledging--by acknowledging the pain and the grief that so many in our community are feeling.,30,,
78,0.97,700.132,728.761,And to say that we stand with those who continue to be subjected to police violence and to the loss of their children and their mothers and their sisters and their Brothers as a result of something that is absolutely preventable and our challenge is to figure out every day how to prevent it from happening again.,30,,
79,0.97,728.761,732.498,And I am ready for that challenge.,30,,
80,0.97,732.498,741.907,And I am ready to work with each of you and each member of our community to figure out how we rise to the occasion and to see how that looks.,30,,
81,0.97,741.907,762.828,"So I want to thank you all for the work that I know you all are going to commit to do for your tenacious advocacy in this space and, most of all, for your friendship and your collaboration, as I know we are all struggling with this, not just here in Seattle, but across the nation.",30,,
82,0.97,762.828,769.568,"So with that, I'm going to hand it over to Councilmember Herbold who is going to lead us through this conversation.",30,,
83,0.97,769.568,791.056,"We do have to do reports of the work that is before us and that we have done, but in reality it almost feels hollow to go through our regular agenda this morning, so I do want to acknowledge that for those of you who want to give reports of your Committee work, you are absolutely loud to do that.",30,,
84,0.97,791.056,810.242,"But I do want--I do think it's important for us to acknowledge that we are in a unique space this morning and for those who feel they need to dispense with their committee reports, you're welcome to do so.",30,,
85,0.97,810.242,815.514,"Councilmember Herbold, I like to you now for your leadership and your guidance to this conversation.",30,,
86,0.97,815.514,815.848,Thank you.,30,,
87,0.97,815.848,819.251,"Thank you, Council President Gonzalez.",31,,
88,0.97,819.251,826.959,Thank you for setting the context and setting the tone for the Council's efforts and engagement moving forward.,31,,
89,0.97,826.959,839.205,"You have done so with words of love and compassion and healing, with also recognizing that there's a lot of rage in our community right now, not just here in Seattle, but all throughout the country.",31,,
90,0.97,839.205,848.514,There are protests this weekend in over 70 cities across the nation.,31,,
91,0.97,848.514,860.426,"In moving forward with more context around love and compassion, healing and rage, I was really proud to attend not this times event at Westlake on Saturday at 3:00 P.M.",31,,
92,0.97,860.426,876.242,I thanked Andre Taylor for his leadership and for his putting forward and leading and lifting the voices of impacted family members who have lost folks.,31,,
93,0.97,876.242,892.992,"I appreciate the fact that clergy came out to participate and, again, lifting the words of rage and sorrow does not mean we cannot move forward with Nonviolence.",31,,
94,0.97,892.992,918.684,I have been inspired by not this time's use of love in the face of loss of life to successfully move policymakers in this phase and in this state towards reform so black and Brown people do not suffer from Traumatizing experiences with law enforcement and insuring those officers that Callusly take precious life are held accountable.,31,,
95,0.97,918.684,936.235,"Embracing Nonviolence does not have to constrain our rights from expressing rage, sorrow and heart break for the failures of this nation that black and Brown people built, failures to deliver justice in law enforcement, deliver economic equality and deliver educational equity.",31,,
96,0.97,936.235,943.275,This was the tone that was set at the event that I attended at 3:00 P.M.,31,,
97,0.97,943.275,945.244,At Westlake.,31,,
98,0.97,945.244,964.463,"And, again, I appreciate the commitment to efforts that embrace Nonviolence was really, again, embraced and integral to the coming together at Westlake.",31,,
99,0.97,964.463,1007.239,"But just a block away it was a very, very, very different scene, and I was traveling kind of back and forth from listening to speakers, to trying to see what was happening on sixth and pine throughout the afternoon, and while I--when I was at the location, I was willing to believe that every time I heard a flash bomb or saw a release of tear gas, that maybe I wasn't close enough to hear what was happening or see what was happening.",31,,
100,0.97,1007.239,1030.362,"But in my conversations with people after the event, people confirmed for me that their experience was that they were not receiving advanced notice or receiving orders to disperse which are required under city law.",31,,
101,0.97,1030.362,1053.152,I just want to take a moment and read the requirements of the--of the city in our legislation and this is legislation that--around crowd dispersal that resulted from the engagement and recommendations of the community police Commission.,31,,
102,0.97,1053.152,1068.3,"The section starts, upon determining that there are acts or conduct within a group of four or more persons that create a substantial risk of causing injury to any person or substantial harm to property, the incident commander may order that the crowd be dispersed.",31,,
103,0.97,1068.3,1078.811,"Before ordering that the crowd be dispersed, the incident commander shall consider whether less restricted means of crowd management are available.",31,,
104,0.97,1078.811,1087.252,"Such means may include strategies, such as area denial and/or seeking voluntary compliance.",31,,
105,0.97,1087.252,1093.892,"Upon determining that dispersal is appropriate, the incident commander shall ensure there is an Avenue of Egress sufficient to allow the crowd to depart.",31,,
106,0.97,1093.892,1102.067,The incident commander or Designee will issue the order to disperse prior to instructing officers to disperse the crowd.,31,,
107,0.97,1102.067,1124.623,"Upon determining that the crowd presents an intimate risk to public safety or that Large- scale property destruction appears likely, the incident commander must consider placing officers at the rear of the crowd to verify that the order to disperse will actually be heard by all, and they issue the following order, I am, rank and name, of the Seattle police Department.",31,,
108,0.97,1124.623,1132.831,"I am now issuing a public safety order to disperse and I command all of those assembled to immediately disperse, which means you must leave the area.",31,,
109,0.97,1132.831,1138.871,"If you do not do so, you may be arrested or subject to other police action.",31,,
110,0.97,1138.871,1148.28,Other police action could include the use of chemical agents or less lethal munitions which may infect significant--or result in serious injury.,31,,
111,0.97,1148.28,1155.954,If you remain in the area just described regardless of your purpose you will be in violation of city and state law.,31,,
112,0.97,1155.954,1169.401,"So again, these are commands that are required to be issued before each and every order to disperse--or before each and every action to disperse a crowd.",31,,
113,0.97,1169.401,1188.587,"This section goes on to say that a reasonable amount of time must be given for the crowd to disperse and that amount of time must be stated, and the order to disperse must be repeated before each action on the part of the Department.",31,,
114,0.97,1188.587,1227.993,"So we have a system of Civilian-Led police accountability and we know that the OPA has already received countless numbers of complaints, and social media has generated a lot of Video evidence, and I want to also thank Councilmember Mosqueda for compiling a number of those videos and sending to the police chief just this weekend, which I also forwarded on to director Meyerberg.",31,,
115,0.97,1227.993,1285.317,"And the opportunity that we are providing for the Council to come together on Wednesday, our hope is to not only hear from the police chief and the fire chief and the executive on issues related to injuries, the loss of weapons in the instance that assault weapons were taken from a police car and at least two different occasions, hearing about the damage to property downtown, but also to really have a conversation with members of the public and hear from them about their experiences, so we have talked about assembling a panel before the meeting begins.",31,,
116,0.97,1285.317,1292.19,"There will of course, as there always is, there will also be public comment at the beginning of the meeting that we will be having on Wednesday.",31,,
117,0.97,1292.19,1296.628,The time has not yet been identified.,31,,
118,0.97,1296.628,1315.647,"He also want to include the office of police accountability, the office of the inspector general and the community police Commission and the community police Commission has a meeting that morning and we want to make sure that they are able to be present.",31,,
119,0.97,1315.647,1326.358,"As mentioned, the office of police accountability director Andrew Meyerberg has acknowledged the work that they are going to be doing moving forward.",31,,
120,0.97,1326.358,1336.234,He has confirmed that incidents that Councilmember Mosqueda sent on as well as scores of others are under active investigation.,31,,
121,0.97,1336.234,1353.452,"He has contacted us to say that the OPA is in the process of identifying the involved officers and are reviewing the significant amount of Video that was recorded both before, during and after the incidents.",31,,
122,0.97,1353.452,1362.427,Director Meyerberg says he will be in a position to provide more information over the next few days and WELCOMES the opportunity to brief us.,31,,
123,0.97,1362.427,1382.08,"He mentions that no determinations have been made by the OPA regarding the propriety of any of the use of force and findings will not be issued until after a full investigation has been conducted, which will include, forensic Video review and witnesses' complaint and officer interviews.",31,,
124,0.97,1382.08,1414.679,"I want to underscore the fact that the OPA in doing its investigations, does consult with community members who have witnessed these events and I think that's going to be a really significant part of the OPA's investigation, is the time and effort necessary to interview the many, many, many people who have witnessed these events of the weekend.",31,,
125,0.97,1414.679,1430.929,"Again, in, I think, the last--the last thing I want to close out with is just, I want to, again, thank Council President Gonzalez for her leadership in this area.",31,,
126,0.97,1430.929,1434.833,I want to mention as well that--I'm sorry.,31,,
127,0.97,1434.833,1435.634,I'm losing track here.,31,,
128,0.97,1435.634,1479.11,"I want to publicly mention that for folks who are listening who have complaints regarding officer misconduct, the--again, the city has a Three- pronged accountability structure and you can file complaints anonymously by Emailing OPA @ Seattle.Gov and you can go to their Website to read more about that process at Http--in addition, there's a phone number that you can use, 206-864-8797.",31,,
129,0.97,1479.11,1488.487,"We understand that call volume is very high right now and that's, of course, to be expected.",31,,
130,0.97,1488.487,1558.523,"And, you know, I also just want to--again, I don't think I need to go through all of what I have seen over the weekend on social media but suffice it to say that there is a lot Video evidence out there that CONFIRMS that our city has work to do as it relates to properly handling interactions with members of the community particularly at times like this and I really am looking forward to doing that work and to joining with those of you on the Council who I know are as committed as I am and Council President Gonzalez is in rolling up our sleeves to hear from community and make sure that we are lifting their voices in making us a better city.",31,,
131,0.97,1558.523,1577.375,"And so I think before moving on to other committee reports, it might be good for Council President Gonzalez to hear whether or not folks on the Council have comments or questions.",31,,
132,0.97,1577.375,1590.255,"Yeah, I think we should allow for an opportunity for questions, discussion, comments and remarks here before we move along.",32,,
133,0.97,1590.255,1604.202,So I knew there was going to be a lot of interest by my colleagues on this--which is why I asked Councilmember Herbold before the meeting to agree to go first so we can have enough time to address this issue.,32,,
134,0.97,1604.202,1610.709,"So, colleagues, now is the time to indicate to me that you are interested.",32,,
135,0.97,1610.709,1623.088,"I saw Councilmember Sawant's hand go up, Councilmember Lewis' hand was raised and then we will hear from Councilmember Strauss.",32,,
136,0.97,1623.088,1624.422,Councilmember Sawant.,32,,
137,0.97,1624.422,1629.361,Thank you.,33,,
138,0.97,1629.361,1629.794,Just one second.,33,,
139,0.97,1629.794,1633.965,"Thank you for your comment, Councilmembers.",33,,
140,0.97,1633.965,1642.173,"Josh Floyd said, I can't breathe again and again while his last breath of life was latched away by the Minneapolis police Department.",33,,
141,0.97,1642.173,1642.574,This is murder.,33,,
142,0.97,1642.574,1655.153,"It is murder at the hands of the police and the racist state and it is commonplace in capitalist America where we have just seen the racist killings of Brianna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, among others.",33,,
143,0.97,1655.153,1679.678,On Saturday I was honored and proud to speak at the justice for George Floyd protest which was held in downtown Seattle and organized by community leaders as part of the nationwide movement against police violence and racist killings of black and Brown people and of poor people and our homeless neighbors.,33,,
144,0.97,1679.678,1703.201,"At that protest I personally witnessed the unacceptable escalation of violence from the Seattle police Department, and we have had hundreds, if not thousands of accounts from ordinary people, community members of unacceptable conduct from the Seattle police Department.",33,,
145,0.97,1703.201,1716.614,It is tragically ironic that we live in a society where a protest against police brutality and violence was met with police brutality and violence.,33,,
146,0.97,1716.614,1726.524,"Seattle police officers in this community used tear gas, Mace, flash bang grenades and other types of excessive use of force on the peaceful protests.",33,,
147,0.97,1726.524,1740.004,"To give examples of what I mean by indiscriminate, one of those is hundreds of people reporting being Enveloped in clouds of tear gas, repeated flash bang grenades which I witnessed myself.",33,,
148,0.97,1740.004,1751.182,Many of us have seen the Video of a 7-Year-Old girl Maced by police officers and there are countless other examples.,33,,
149,0.97,1751.182,1773.638,"Many protesters reported that police officers had their identification covered up with black tape and whether or not police officers are legally required to identify themselves, it is clearly an attempt to prevent accountability when people who are among police who are violently suppressing protests are actively hiding their identity.",33,,
150,0.97,1773.638,1781.546,"Astoundingly, there are also videos of an SPD officer kneeling on someone's neck during an arrest on Saturday.",33,,
151,0.97,1781.546,1782.28,It is unspeakable.,33,,
152,0.97,1782.28,1788.987,"Instead of answering the demands of the community nationwide, the establishment in every city keeps escalating.",33,,
153,0.97,1788.987,1812.043,"There are calls for the National Guard, declarations of Curfew, and Mayor Dur can and other politicians who claim to be saddened by the murder of George Floyd have enabled the systematic racism and violence from the Seattle police Department.",33,,
154,0.97,1812.043,1819.083,"There hasn't been any accountability actually as community members, they don't agree that there has been any accountability.",33,,
155,0.97,1819.083,1835.6,"Where is the Outraging from politicians over the killing of Charleena Lyles, Shay Taylor, the 24-year-old just a few weeks ago who was killed by the police, shot in the head while holding his baby in his arms.",33,,
156,0.97,1835.6,1843.508,And none of these killings at the hands of the police have been prosecuted or punished.,33,,
157,0.97,1843.508,1861.559,The Outraging on the streets represents the deep community anger about police violence on top of the profound and long- standing suffering caused by the political establishment's failure to meet the basic needs of working people before and during the crisis.,33,,
158,0.97,1861.559,1875.607,"The Mayor said, I want to acknowledge--this is a quote, I want to acknowledge that much of the violence and destruction both here in Seattle and across the country has been Instigated and perpetuated by white men.",33,,
159,0.97,1875.607,1884.249,"These individuals experience a height of privilege and--meant to--particularly black Americans, Unquote.",33,,
160,0.97,1884.249,1884.549,I'm sorry.,33,,
161,0.97,1884.549,1891.723,This is an absolutely shameful application of responsibility for a stunningly violent police force.,33,,
162,0.97,1891.723,1899.43,"There were families with children there, many families with children, with elderly community members there.",33,,
163,0.97,1899.43,1907.472,"As activist and community leader Nikkita Oliver said, quote, the good versus bad protest--is a false dichotomy.",33,,
164,0.97,1907.472,1913.645,"It is intended to distract us from the real issue, violent police and police brutality.",33,,
165,0.97,1913.645,1917.749,"It is mass victim blaming and gas lighting, Unquote.",33,,
166,0.97,1917.749,1926.758,Where was the Curfew and Militarized police presence when armed white--right wingers were protesting to open the state against the virus.,33,,
167,0.97,1926.758,1932.563,"I am confused, she says, on how you are protecting the first amendment of our home.",33,,
168,0.97,1932.563,1939.304,"Seattle doesn't need a Curfew, pepper spray, doesn't need Mace, tear gas or flash bang grenades.",33,,
169,0.97,1939.304,1941.572,We need an end to racist police violence.,33,,
170,0.97,1941.572,1950.548,"We need economic and housing security, including immediate Covid relief housing and jobs O the Amazon tax.",33,,
171,0.97,1950.548,1953.117,We need an end to humane homeless sweets.,33,,
172,0.97,1953.117,1962.36,"We need the cancellations of rents, mortgages and utility payments for those who have lost incomes who are predominantly working class and poor communities of color.",33,,
173,0.97,1962.36,1968.499,We need an elected community oversight board with full powers over the police including hiring and firing.,33,,
174,0.97,1968.499,1980.478,I am glad that a city council meeting is being organized for Wednesday but I do not believe that real accountability will come without ordinary people building a mass--movement.,33,,
175,0.97,1980.478,2007.939,"That is why we have launched a commute competition as a first step demanding that Mayor Durkan and the Seattle city council--launch--misconduct at the justice for George Floyd protests and discipline or fire all officers who engaged in excessive use of force, brutality against protesters and other misconduct.",33,,
176,0.97,2007.939,2015.346,Nearly 2600 people have signed this petition and it was launched only at around 8:30 last night.,33,,
177,0.97,2015.346,2029.994,"There is tremendous anger among community members and a demand that this is actually addressed Finally, and I will say, in closing, that it is not enough to have words and rhetoric.",33,,
178,0.97,2029.994,2037.235,This city Council has voted on a police contract that the community said please vote no on this police contract.,33,,
179,0.97,2037.235,2037.869,It takes away accountability.,33,,
180,0.97,2037.869,2046.077,"Unfortunately I was the only ""No"" vote on it and Unfortunately sections of the leadership also were--about that contract.",33,,
181,0.97,2046.077,2061.292,I am proud that over 40 rank and file union leaders and rank and file and union leaders stood with me supporting that black community because we the understand an injury to one is an injury to all.,33,,
182,0.97,2061.292,2070.735,I will mention an honorable thing that has been done by members of the labor movement has led by a member of Socialist--Adam Burch in Minneapolis.,33,,
183,0.97,2070.735,2080.478,He is a bus driver and he's a member of ATU local 1005 and he declared that he will not bus protesters to jail.,33,,
184,0.97,2080.478,2084.282,"His fellow members, the Union have joined him.",33,,
185,0.97,2084.282,2095.493,"Atu International issued a statement following that, Minneapolis nurses, Minneapolis teachers, and I am also announcing that--and declared that an injury to one is an injury to all.",33,,
186,0.97,2095.493,2101.866,"That is the kind of community organizing we need led by members of the labor movement, members of the community.",33,,
187,0.97,2101.866,2111.442,"And last but not least, we absolutely cannot accept the lifting of the consent decree for excessive police force because that is there for good reason.",33,,
188,0.97,2111.442,2124.255,I know Mayor Durkan and the political establishment are attempting to release the police force from that consent decree in one breath and then say that they are actually going to do something about accountability.,33,,
189,0.97,2124.255,2125.823,I don't think the two things are consistent.,33,,
190,0.97,2125.823,2135.633,We need to have a consent decree and an instant community led investigation into what happened on Saturday alongside discipline and fighting of officers who were involved.,33,,
191,0.97,2135.633,2135.867,Thank you.,33,,
192,0.97,2141.606,2144.775,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",34,,
193,0.97,2144.775,2151.849,"Councilmember Herbold, did you want an opportunity to respond to any of Councilmember Sawant's comments or would you like for everybody to comment before that?",34,,
194,0.97,2151.849,2153.885,I am taking notes.,35,,
195,0.97,2153.885,2158.589,"I can--if I could, just do some Wrap-Up comments at the end.",35,,
196,0.97,2158.589,2158.856,Great.,36,,
197,0.97,2158.856,2159.223,Thank you.,37,,
198,0.97,2159.223,2160.591,We will do so.,38,,

200,0.97,2167.832,2171.369,There's a very loud noise outside my window.,39,,
201,0.97,2171.369,2176.674,If I could maybe let Councilmember Strauss go first and then I will go after him.,39,,
202,0.97,2176.674,2176.974,Great.,40,,
203,0.97,2176.974,2181.512,"Yeah, Councilmember Strauss, are you ready to go now?",40,,
204,0.97,2181.512,2181.979,Yes.,41,,
205,0.97,2181.979,2183.314,Thank you.,41,,
206,0.97,2183.314,2183.848,There you go.,42,,
207,0.97,2183.848,2189.053,Floor is yours and we will head back to Councilmember Lewis and then Councilmember Mosqueda.,42,,
208,0.97,2189.053,2193.991,What I saw this weekend was pain.,43,,
209,0.97,2193.991,2201.799,I saw the accumulation--perpetuated against African- Americans come to a head.,43,,
210,0.97,2201.799,2202.567,Cause destruction.,43,,
211,0.97,2202.567,2203.968,I am a white man.,43,,
212,0.97,2203.968,2211.075,I fully acknowledge that I will never truly understand the pain of my black and Brown neighbors and this doesn't mean that I don't understand.,43,,
213,0.97,2211.075,2221.185,What I can do is listen and use my power and privilege to disrupt the cycle of oppression in housing and education and the criminal justice system and in Healthcare.,43,,
214,0.97,2221.185,2231.662,"To my fellow white folks, we must believe people when they tell us about their experiences with racism and we must confront racism.",43,,
215,0.97,2231.662,2233.965,Subtle or overt.,43,,
216,0.97,2233.965,2238.169,"Otherwise, we are complicit of perpetuating these systems and racist actions.",43,,
217,0.97,2238.169,2242.64,I don't want to take up more space here and now to my black and Brown neighbors.,43,,
218,0.97,2242.64,2245.61,"Please know I see you, hear you and fight with you.",43,,
219,0.97,2245.61,2247.111,"Thank you, Council President.",43,,
220,0.97,2247.111,2248.746,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",44,,
221,0.97,2248.746,2252.049,Next up we will head back over to Councilmember Lewis.,44,,
222,0.97,2252.049,2252.683,Please.,44,,
223,0.97,2252.683,2265.73,"Thank you so much, Madam president and I want to thank all my colleagues who have spoken so far on their really important words this morning after a weekend that had so much power in it.",45,,
224,0.97,2265.73,2290.821,"You know, and I strongly join--I think I can speak for everyone on this Council in condemning the callous and horrific killing of George Floyd by an officer of the Minneapolis police Department which is why it was so greatly inspiring to see hundreds of demonstrators assemble under the leadership of not this time at Westlake park in the heart of district seven on Saturday.",45,,
225,0.97,2290.821,2305.87,And I want to thank the brave journalists nationally and locally who in some cases at great peril to themselves have covered these demonstrations for the entire world to see.,45,,
226,0.97,2305.87,2323.12,Our community is benefiting from the massive and righteous Airing of the extreme inequality and the extreme systemic racism that underpins our criminal legal system in the United States.,45,,
227,0.97,2323.12,2334.799,And it's important because we can't let the actions of a few people who engaged in looting distract from the core message of those millions of people who took to America's streets to demonstrate.,45,,
228,0.97,2334.799,2338.135,Of course we all flatly condemn looting.,45,,
229,0.97,2338.135,2342.606,But today that can't be the narrative and that can't be what we are talking about.,45,,
230,0.97,2342.606,2353.918,"What we have to be talking about is the racial bias and policing is real, that it's ongoing, and that it frequently results in the tragic loss of life in this country.",45,,
231,0.97,2353.918,2364.929,"And we can't abandon, like the President has, our role in this historic moment as leaders with the unique opportunity to demand change as a city council.",45,,
232,0.97,2364.929,2405.503,"We as a see Council have power to continue to reform American policing and the recommendations of our own oversight agencies that we recorded in February in letters attached to resolution 31-930 provide the framework for paths towards more accountable policing that we can work towards as a Council and a couple those highlights, broad subpoena power, a preponderance standard for findings of misconduct, an extension of the 180 Timeline for investigations of misconduct, prohibiting Denovo review Arbitrators of the police chief's disciplinary actions.",45,,
233,0.97,2405.503,2434.265,"These measures and many others demand full attention of this Council and I look forward to working on these issues with all of my colleagues, as does underpinning all of this, the need for support, protection and the expansion of the hard fought accountability agencies that Madam President you worked so hard, the office of police accountability and the inspector general during difficult budget discussions that we are going to have this year.",45,,
234,0.97,2434.265,2438.068,"And Councilmember Herbold, I look forward to the committee meeting this Wednesday.",45,,
235,0.97,2438.068,2441.472,I will certainly come prepared with my questions.,45,,
236,0.97,2441.472,2451.615,And we cannot forget that at the core of this weekend what we witnessed was history and that as leaders we bear a responsibility to rise to this challenge and take on the hard work of reform.,45,,
237,0.97,2451.615,2455.019,I look forward to digging into that work with all of you.,45,,
238,0.97,2455.019,2457.555,Thank you so much.,45,,
239,0.97,2457.555,2457.922,Thank you.,46,,
240,0.97,2457.922,2461.659,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis, for those remarks.",46,,
241,0.97,2461.659,2473.971,We are going to move over to Councilmember Mosqueda and then hear from Councilmember Morales.,46,,
242,0.97,2473.971,2477.141,"Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",46,,
243,0.97,2477.141,2478.676,"Councilmember Herbold, can you mute, please.",47,,
244,0.97,2478.676,2482.279,Now we can hear from Councilmember Mosqueda.,47,,
245,0.97,2482.279,2483.013,Please.,47,,
246,0.97,2483.013,2483.714,Thank you Council President.,48,,
247,0.97,2483.714,2493.991,I want to talk about a few of the videos that Councilmember Herbold mentioned that I shared with the director Meyerberg and the chief.,48,,
248,0.97,2493.991,2498.462,These are videos and reports that many of you have already seen.,48,,
249,0.97,2498.462,2506.003,Councilmember Sawant mentioned them and Councilmember Herbold and Council President Gonzalez Referenced them as well.,48,,
250,0.97,2506.003,2516.714,"A 9-Year-Old pepper sprayed in the face and screaming in terror, holding to her dad while milk was poured over her face.",48,,
251,0.97,2516.714,2524.255,A thumb amputated by a flash bang device and the medical crew among the demonstrators had to tend to this person.,48,,
252,0.97,2524.255,2534.532,"Multiple reports that audible warnings were not given to a diverse crowd, including children, elderly and people with disabilities.",48,,
253,0.97,2534.532,2551.382,"Tear gas fired just a block away, 100 yards away was reported Online from the main rally, pushing people into the main rally instead of separating those who may be using diverse protesting tactics.",48,,
254,0.97,2551.382,2556.754,"Gas canisters fired into the crowd, hitting people, hitting bodies, hitting faces instead of going up into the air.",48,,
255,0.97,2556.754,2570.634,"We heard stories from people at the protests that there were parents running down the streets holding their toddlers under their arm, and I saw TV reporters echoing the same sentiment.",48,,
256,0.97,2570.634,2581.812,"People running away because they didn't have enough time to get out of harm's way from the police and their dispersal tactics, tear gas, noise devices, using bikes.",48,,
257,0.97,2581.812,2595.459,"I saw a couple who appeared to be shocked and covered in red Mace or spray from the pepper spray in their face, reaching for each other because they couldn't see each other.",48,,
258,0.97,2595.459,2596.493,They were on the sidewalk.,48,,
259,0.97,2596.493,2602.333,They had been pushed to that sidewalk by the same police using those bikes.,48,,
260,0.97,2602.333,2607.605,"I have been in those situations, you all have been in those situations.",48,,
261,0.97,2607.605,2628.626,"We expect to hear a notice for dispersal and those who are using diverse protesting tactics because all tactics are sometimes needed to call attention to issues if it is an effort to draw attention and use a sit-in strategy or to block a street, diverse tactics are often used.",48,,
262,0.97,2628.626,2642.806,"But in that situation where people were standing on the street, not causing harm, not assaulting officers, not harming properly, in those videos that we saw, there was no Dispersele forming.",48,,
263,0.97,2642.806,2646.944,People were actively harmed by the strategies used.,48,,
264,0.97,2646.944,2656.687,I'm not talking about Minneapolis or New York or Los Angeles or Austin or all of the cities that we saw an extreme use of force.,48,,
265,0.97,2656.687,2669.133,"I'm talking about right here in our city, right here in our own back yard, right here on the same streets where we have been proud of our efforts to try to reform strategies and use De- escalation tactics.",48,,
266,0.97,2669.133,2678.242,"None of those tactics appeared to be used and it was a United strategy, apparently, across each of the cities because it is inherent and embedded in system that need reform.",48,,
267,0.97,2678.242,2682.713,More than the reforms that we have imposed in the past.,48,,
268,0.97,2682.713,2692.523,"The very thing that everybody was protesting, excessive police force, was met by a Militarized response.",48,,
269,0.97,2692.523,2693.023,A Militarized response.,48,,
270,0.97,2693.023,2722.252,"Yes, it was Stoked by the President and, yes, it was Stoked by others, but it was carried out right in our city, and as the President of Minneapolis' city council said, as many of you know her, Lisa Bender, a leader within local progress, she says two years ago the city created--efforts to Reimagine public safety through the lens of public health and she went on to say, it is clear to me that our attempts to Incrementally reform our policing have failed.",48,,
271,0.97,2722.252,2723.153,We need deep structural change.,48,,
272,0.97,2723.153,2727.224,"It is not only possible, it is imperative and we have laid the groundwork for it.",48,,
273,0.97,2727.224,2734.998,I think Seattle is in the same place we have laid the groundwork but much more structural change is needed.,48,,
274,0.97,2734.998,2778.408,"So I'm very anxious to get to the accountability elements of this, as you heard, I E-Mailed the police chief and have been in conversations, thanks to Councilmember Herbold, with Andrew Meyerberg, the director to make sure that the videos, only the few videos that I have been able to compile and I know there's other people looking at hours and hours of videos, but as we--as we know that there will be a process, we cannot wait, we cannot lose sight of the reason behind the thousands in the street and this country, the Outraging, the fear, the grief, at the senseless and violate killing--here in Seattle as well.",48,,
275,0.97,2778.408,2789.853,And Militarized response only fuels more unrest and more distress and it endangers our unarmed community members who are justified in being in the streets.,48,,
276,0.97,2789.853,2803.033,Abundant and excessive force only brings greater anger and further silences of voice of those are already upset that their voice continues to be silenced and ignored.,48,,
277,0.97,2803.033,2812.142,Protests take many forms and we in Seattle have showed what it means to have civil disobedience of very different kinds.,48,,
278,0.97,2812.142,2819.016,"So, yes, let's not get into the rhetoric of the good Protester and the bad Protester.",48,,
279,0.97,2819.016,2835.265,"As one Minneapolis Organizer, main Organizer who has been trying to work within the system to change and reform the system said, you know, they spent many hours sitting down with the governor and the Mayor and their city councils and he says I don't Condone destruction but I understand it.",48,,
280,0.97,2835.265,2862.292,"So, colleagues, I hope we are all saying we understand why the destruction happened, and we understand why people are upset after centuries of oppression, slavery, senseless killings, it is no wonder there is anger and outrage here and across the country.",48,,
281,0.97,2862.292,2873.07,It is not illegal to be angry or upset with the police and it does not warrant the type of response that we saw that escalated by the police actions in the street.,48,,
282,0.97,2873.07,2898.862,"And to have those individuals, hundreds, thousands of people who E-Mailed me and then also were reported on--in ""the Seattle times"" and other outlets over the weekend say that their experience was not actually what the experience was, people are reporting in the ""Seattle times"" they felt gas lighted, that their experience being in the treat was not reflected in the way in which the leadership in the city was responding to the concerns out there.",48,,
283,0.97,2898.862,2900.264,People had children with them.,48,,
284,0.97,2900.264,2901.498,There were parents with them.,48,,
285,0.97,2901.498,2906.136,There are famous with their and that is the type of response they faced.,48,,
286,0.97,2906.136,2911.041,I want to express how important it is that we follow through on these accountability conversations.,48,,
287,0.97,2911.041,2913.844,I thank the Council president and the their for having the meeting on Wednesday.,48,,
288,0.97,2913.844,2951.248,"I also want to make sure that we don't forget to underscore the bravery and the solidarity and the camaraderie that we saw amongst the protesters in Seattle, you know, no matter what your tactics were, we saw people coming out and enjoying solidarity across the city for folks who saw the response across the nation, we know that it is imperative to interrupt business as usual to get attention and we cannot allow ourselves to fall into respectability politics when this demands action and attention.",48,,
289,0.97,2951.248,2972.469,"I want to thank everybody who stood in the streets, who demanded justice, who shared their stories Online if they were not able to go out this weekend, and who are interested in making sure that we act to this call to action so there's not another name in other two weeks in other city or even in another two hours.",48,,
290,0.97,2972.469,2985.682,And I stand in solidarity with the comments that have been made already by this Council and more importantly the community leaders who led the actions over the weekend.,48,,
291,0.97,2985.682,2986.75,Thank you.,48,,
292,0.97,2986.75,2988.685,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",49,,
293,0.97,2988.685,3004.701,Next up we will hear from Councilmember Morales Morales and if there are other members let me know.,49,,
294,0.97,3004.701,3008.905,"You are on mute, Councilmember.",49,,
295,0.97,3008.905,3010.44,Thank you.,50,,
296,0.97,3010.44,3020.851,"Thank you, Council President Gonzalez and Councilmember Herbold for all the work you have been doing over the weekend.",50,,
297,0.97,3020.851,3027.891,We know the last couple of weeks have brought into relief the depths of the structural racism in our society.,50,,
298,0.97,3027.891,3061.024,"We were already talking about that in the context of Coved and the disproportionate impacts that is having on black and Brown community members and then to see the calloused demeanor of a police officer as he kneels on a man's neck and listens to him plead for his life for eight minutes and kills him, or the confidence of a white--to set up an innocent black man.",50,,
299,0.97,3061.024,3067.464,Or even the events that we have seen unfold in our own city.,50,,
300,0.97,3067.464,3081.878,These blatant expressions of racism operate within all systems of our society in the way it's structured and it has unleashed a fury of our black neighbors across this country and in Seattle and it's a fury we should all share.,50,,
301,0.97,3081.878,3106.503,"You know, I was down there this weekend at Westlake as many of you were, and I have been hearing all weekend from constituents, clergy who went to bear witness, people who went to serve as allies, you know, and what everybody reports is that they were engaged in peaceful demonstration and things were fine until the S.W.A.T.",50,,
302,0.97,3106.503,3131.428,"Team arrived, until the bike patrol arrived, you know, and the feeling of the folks who were down there is that there was an expectation, there was just waiting on the part of the police Department to be provoked and there was--there didn't seem to be a preparation for De-Escalating anything.",50,,
303,0.97,3131.428,3136.933,"Instead, there was the kind of reaction that we saw this weekend.",50,,
304,0.97,3136.933,3160.056,"I was also down in the Cid yesterday and I want to say that I was happy to see community members coming out to help repair windows, you know, to clean graffiti off of the walls and I feel for those small businesses and I am happy to see that people are willing to help do these repairs and I am extremely thankful that nobody was injured there.",50,,
305,0.97,3160.056,3189.619,"But what I don't want to hear is from our constituents to be told to be civil, not to be reactionary, to be told that looting doesn't solve anything, and, you know, it does make me wonder and ask the question why looting bothers people so much more than knowing that across the country black men and women are dying every day and far too often at the hands of those who are sworn to protect and serve.",50,,
306,0.97,3189.619,3199.996,"Yesterday's headline in the ""New York times"" was ""facing protests over use of force, police respond with more force ."" it didn't just happen here or in Minneapolis.",50,,
307,0.97,3199.996,3203.066,It happened in every city across the country.,50,,
308,0.97,3203.066,3210.206,"So it's true that we need Transformative change at the national level, but that's not entirely in our control.",50,,
309,0.97,3210.206,3224.02,What is in our control is how we act here in Seattle as local elected officials and here's how we lean into our Antiracist values as the Mayor suggested yesterday.,50,,
310,0.97,3224.02,3232.462,"We withdraw the motion to terminate the consent decree, we restore the police accountability measures that community fought so hard for.",50,,
311,0.97,3232.462,3242.672,We Reallocate our budget to improve community conditions that can close the opportunity Úgap and repair the harm done t our black and Brown communities.,50,,
312,0.97,3242.672,3250.78,We invest in economic development and prosperity for our black and Brown communities in a credible and thoughtful way.,50,,
313,0.97,3250.78,3253.783,We dismantle generational Landownership through community ownership.,50,,
314,0.97,3253.783,3260.323,We fully fund the office of civil rights and the--program.,50,,
315,0.97,3260.323,3261.524,We can't keep Tokenizing this program.,50,,
316,0.97,3261.524,3276.339,The work of those city employees is critical to the way the city operates and the policies and principles embedded in the race and social justice initiative need to actually show up in the critical decisions that we make about the police force.,50,,
317,0.97,3276.339,3279.342,No one should be surprised by this uprising.,50,,
318,0.97,3279.342,3283.813,We all know the brutal history of oppression in this country.,50,,
319,0.97,3283.813,3301.931,"We have an entire lexicon of protest songs that go back generations, just in my lifetime I listed some that came to mind immediately this morning, a change is going to come, get up, stand up, taking it to the streets, know your fights, talking about a revolution, people have the power.",50,,
320,0.97,3301.931,3320.85,"This is not new in this country, but it is time to do something about it.",50,,
321,0.97,3320.85,3325.221,My constituents are tired . My staff is tired.,50,,
322,0.97,3325.221,3335.098,"And as an ally, I will continue to check in with the communities that I represent, the communities most impacted by this.",50,,
323,0.97,3335.098,3348.178,And will leverage my position in office to call for real change and real accountability because our black neighbors have carried the burden of this emotional trauma for too long.,50,,
324,0.97,3348.178,3348.411,Thank you.,50,,
325,0.97,3354.718,3357.42,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales for those remarks.",51,,
326,0.97,3357.42,3364.594,And I want to thank everybody who has spoken thus far for your remarks.,51,,
327,0.97,3364.594,3373.87,"Do want to offer another opportunity to any of my colleagues, Councilmember Pedersen, please.",51,,
328,0.97,3373.87,3374.571,"Thank you, colleagues.",52,,
329,0.97,3374.571,3385.048,I couldn't have said it better than all of you who have spoken before me and I just want to let you know I stand in partnership with my Council colleagues on this.,52,,
330,0.97,3385.048,3397.427,"I have pledged to be a genuine ally and help ensure we center the voices of those harmed by police officers acting inappropriately, and to ensure accountability with our oversight and our policy making powers as a city council.",52,,
331,0.97,3397.427,3397.66,Thank you.,52,,
332,0.97,3400.663,3417.447,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen . colleagues, any other comments before we--before we allow Councilmember Herbold to have the last word?",53,,
333,0.97,3417.447,3425.488,I know we process grief and trauma differently so I want to be respectful of those folks who haven't spoken up yet.,53,,
334,0.97,3425.488,3434.164,I think we got to understand that we are all processing this in a different way.,53,,
335,0.97,3434.164,3437.2,I saw Councilmember Sawant's hand go up again.,53,,
336,0.97,3437.2,3445.074,"We will hear from Sawant and if there are no other comments, we will hear from Councilmember Herbold.",53,,
337,0.97,3445.074,3446.843,"Thank you, president Gonzalez.",54,,
338,0.97,3446.843,3447.877,I wanted to make two points.,54,,
339,0.97,3447.877,3471.0,"One is in just--because we--if the city Council and the city's political officials are serious about getting--we have to look at the facts as well, and one of the facts is the stunning conference and comments by Mayor Durkan and chief best.",54,,
340,0.97,3471.0,3485.748,"It is extremely unfortunate, the comments that they have made and I have already shared one of the comments about the whole bad Protester versus good Protester that Mayor Durkan is--this is the length that her administration is putting forward.",54,,
341,0.97,3485.748,3490.854,But there's another aspect to it as well.,54,,
342,0.97,3490.854,3509.739,"In our message about George Floyd's killing, Seattle police chief best said, quote, because of the Seattle police Department's high level of training, our commitment to De- escalation and our track record of--I have confidence that something like this would not occur in our city, Unquote.",54,,
343,0.97,3509.739,3511.474,I am stand by this.,54,,
344,0.97,3511.474,3514.01,Is chief best being serious?,54,,
345,0.97,3514.01,3525.021,"This is the police Department with a long and notorious track record of systematic violence against communities of color, poor people, homeless neighbors and people facing mental illness.",54,,
346,0.97,3525.021,3533.196,This is the same police Department that has been under U.S. Justice Department consent decrees since 2012.,54,,
347,0.97,3533.196,3536.432,Chief best says something like George Floyd would not occur in our city.,54,,
348,0.97,3536.432,3551.514,Anybody with a modicum of honesty will know and admit that it has happened and continues to happen in our city and not one single SPD officer has been prosecuted.,54,,
349,0.97,3551.514,3560.49,Land in glove with the Seattle police officers Guild which has been big component of obstruction to police accountability.,54,,
350,0.97,3560.49,3595.091,The other point is that George Floyd's murder is a chilling preview of the staged response nationwide during a deepening economic crisis that has already resulted in nearly 14 million people becoming unemployed and it is not a coincidence that this brutal suppression of protest was presided over and has been presided over by the same administrations in city after city that are going to be carrying out or are already carrying out--to fund social programs.,54,,
351,0.97,3595.091,3603.433,"Throughout history the greater the inequality in our society, the more resources used to Militarize the police, to enforce that inequality.",54,,
352,0.97,3603.433,3635.398,"That is why in Seattle we absolutely need to fight for an Avenue that is an alternative to austerity that has already been declared by Mayor Durkan and we need to immediately act on passing progressive revenues to invest in housing, jobs and immediate relief for workers but most immediately, of course, we need a community led, an independent investigation of what happened on Saturday to make sure that there's real accountability.",54,,
353,0.97,3635.398,3635.965,Thank you.,54,,
354,0.97,3635.965,3637.7,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",55,,
355,0.97,3637.7,3647.677,Conversation here by hearing Lastly from Councilmember Herbold.,55,,
356,0.97,3647.677,3664.961,"I do, before you make your comments, I want to put one last thing on your list of many things that I know that you're tracking, that I appreciate you tracking on our behalf as our public safety chair here.",55,,
357,0.97,3664.961,3670.8,But I am hearing the potential that the Mayor is considering renewing her executive order around the Curfew.,55,,
358,0.97,3670.8,3675.038,Of course we know that expired at 5:00 A.M.,55,,
359,0.97,3675.038,3675.438,This morning.,55,,
360,0.97,3675.438,3686.282,I just want to flag my ongoing concern about the efficacy of a Curfew renewal.,55,,
361,0.97,3686.282,3730.426,"So I want to make sure that we as a Council are communicating back to the Mayor a collective position on that, particularly since an emergency order that is going to be ongoing related to a Curfew or any other issues could be taken up by the city Council, so, again, I think the focus here should be on making sure that the police Department is responding to the needs of protesters who want to demonstrate in the streets as opposed to issuing, you know, additional emergency orders at this point.",55,,
362,0.97,3730.426,3740.67,I think that I have seen over the last 48 hours that it doesn't appear to be as effective as I think she had hoped.,55,,
363,0.97,3740.67,3744.24,And so I just want to sort of put that on our collective radar.,55,,
364,0.97,3744.24,3761.991,"I don't know for sure if that will--if that extension will occur or not, but to the extent there is thinking around that, I think it's important for us to communicate early with the executive on our collective perspective on that issue.",55,,
365,0.97,3761.991,3762.492,Councilmember Herbold.,55,,
366,0.97,3762.492,3762.859,Thank you.,56,,
367,0.97,3762.859,3801.564,"One of the items that I did want to touch upon before closing out does relate to not a Curfew moving forward, but the way the Curfew was put into place on Saturday, but I do, as it relates to potential curfews moving forward, I do want to highlight that from the executive's position, the utility of the Curfew as described by the Mayor is to allow them to focus on people.",56,,
368,0.97,3801.564,3866.262,"The focus--the police Department's activities on people who stay behind when a Curfew has been called, but when you call Curfew and you have a city full of people who are committed to peaceful direct action and civil disobedience, I don't think that the utility of the Curfew creates the results of, again, having the sort of good Protester/Bad Protester separation, because lots of good, well-meaning people who are driven to be in the streets because of their compassion and their love and their desire for change, stay behind even when the Curfew was called and so if that is some sort of a--you know, I'm sorry for lack of a better word, attempt to separate out good protesters from bad protesters, I don't think it's going to have that same utility.",56,,
369,0.97,3866.262,3879.909,"That said, I mean, I do understand--having, you know, been down there on Saturday and I do understand why the Curfew was called.",56,,
370,0.97,3879.909,3893.489,I do also believe that many of the circumstances that led to the calling of the Curfew could have been differently executed by the police Department.,56,,
371,0.97,3893.489,3896.259,There could have been more De- escalation.,56,,
372,0.97,3896.259,3946.275,"The thing I want to mention about the Curfew, I got the call at 4:57, I believe, from the Mayor's office that there was going to be a Curfew at 5:00, and I spent the next half hour, 45 minutes walking up to every single person that would receive me, you know, after trying to make eye contact through my mask to other people wearing masks, went up to every single black person that I could--that I could reach to notify folks that this Curfew had been announced.",56,,
373,0.97,3946.275,3967.496,And every single person received that information in a way that was appreciated and every single person expressed a wish that that information had been conveyed with more advanced information.,56,,
374,0.97,3967.496,4050.312,"If the tactics of the police Department and our city are intended to change behavior, manage crowds, they have to be delivered in a way that people can actually respond to them, much like I shared at the beginning of my remarks, the city's law and the police Department's policy for the crowd dispersal efforts that are required, verbal commands in advance of taking actions like pepper spray, tear gassing, if you--if the city wants people to take an action such as responding to a Curfew, advanced notice really needs to be made, and the other issue that I heard from a lot of people about, and I know all Councilmembers have, is the fact that there was no coordination with sound transit and so many people who were responding favorably to the order--the Curfew order and seeking to leave downtown and go home had no way of doing so because sound transit operations had ceased downtown.",56,,
375,0.97,4050.312,4086.882,"I also want to flag another issue that I have heard a lot from folks about, and that is the observation, the morning band observation of police officers who have a strip of black tape on their badges, in the center of their badges that covers the badge number and the response from the police Department, from chief best was a recognition that bands are permitted under police policy.",56,,
376,0.97,4086.882,4116.512,I also was reminded this weekend by former Councilmember Peter Stinebrook that the Council has passed a law that requires that officers not cover their names and this law itself does not Opine over the covering of badge numbers on the police badges itself but it requires that names not be obscured.,56,,
377,0.97,4116.512,4130.259,I think there is a way and that we should explore a way because I think the public is right to expect to not just see officers' names but also to be able to record their badge numbers.,56,,
378,0.97,4130.259,4149.945,"I think we need to work to amend the city law that relates only to people's names, to also require that badge numbers not be obscured while allowing the tradition that the police Department has here in the city and all across the nation of allowing for morning bands.",56,,
379,0.97,4149.945,4174.603,"I don't think there needs to be a conflict and I think the public is right to expect to be able to record badge numbers, particularly in light of the fact that use of cell phones is such an effective way of collecting evidence about police activity.",56,,
380,0.97,4174.603,4201.43,I think that really highlights all the more the fact that being able to positively being able to identify an officer is real important when we have so many people in our communities who take their responsibility as civilian bystanders so seriously and they take that responsibility and the risk associated with bearing witness to these interactions.,56,,
381,0.97,4201.43,4215.578,"So I just wanted to flag those two additional, what I see as really policy issues around how curfews are delivered and what our expectations are for police identification.",56,,
382,0.97,4215.578,4221.984,And then finally I just want to respond to the request for a Community-Led Investiation.,56,,
383,0.97,4221.984,4233.229,"As we all know, the Council unanimously voted on a Three- legged accountability system that is civilian led.",56,,
384,0.97,4233.229,4236.332,The OPA director is a civilian.,56,,
385,0.97,4236.332,4248.477,"The Office of the inspector General is led by a civilian, and, of course, we have the community police Commission, which is a Civilian-Led organization.",56,,
386,0.97,4248.477,4284.546,"I do agree, though, that we do need a way to put members of the public at the center of the work that we expect our accountability system to do, and as I mentioned before, creating a process by which we are insuring that the OPA is talking to as many individual members of the public who have firsthand witness accounts of the activities.",56,,
387,0.97,4284.546,4336.932,"I think figuring out a way to bolster that role would be appropriate at this time, particularly considering that, again, there are so many people who have these firsthand experiences, and looking forward to talking more with members of the public about how we can lift the voices of the public with these experiences and while respecting the fact that we have an accountability system and an investigation process that is led by civilians, but really committing to centering the voices of impact to communities in those investigations.",56,,
388,0.97,4336.932,4387.049,"And with that, I just want to wrap up my Committee report, kind of returning to our normally scheduled emergency, just want to note that we learned last week that there will be a proposal--or there that has been a proposal from the Seattle fire Department to the Seattle parks Department to use Alki play field and Walt Hundley play field as emergency Heli pads to transport emergency patients to Harborview, in the event during an emergency in the--the fire Department will be conducting practice runs in early June from those two locations.",56,,
389,0.97,4387.049,4389.651,"Again, that's Alki play field and Walt Hundley play field.",56,,
390,0.97,4389.651,4418.881,"I want to make note of the human services Department's work in the Covid-19 crisis, as we all know, the human services Department has Pivoted to working on food access, understanding that many households have lost access to their--food programs and many might requires assistance as their workplaces have shut down.",56,,
391,0.97,4418.881,4427.99,Many congregate meal sites have changed their model and now food delivered to homes to ensure that community members have access to Nutritious food.,56,,
392,0.97,4427.99,4440.169,"Those congregate meal sites in the month of May prepared almost 46,000 meals, that's an increase in 12,000 meals over the typical number of meals provided.",56,,
393,0.97,4440.169,4480.676,"I have had opportunity to volunteer both at the South Park senior center and the West Seattle food Bank, at one of the congregate meal sites, with which Hsd partners, and I just--as I did last week, I just want to again express my appreciation for the human services Department staff who have participated in the talent redeployment Hub and that I have had the pleasure and the honor of working side by side with making bags of food for the centers to deliver to people in need.",56,,
394,0.97,4480.676,4487.983,Also want to appreciate the work that Hsd did over the weekend to provide shelter for people experiencing homelessness.,56,,
395,0.97,4487.983,4500.863,"As I think most of us know, the Seattle hall shelter, after the area was damaged, they worked to find a new location for people who showed up there.",56,,
396,0.97,4500.863,4506.134,21 individuals were referred to the Seattle center's Fisher pavilion.,56,,
397,0.97,4506.134,4507.369,No one was turned away.,56,,
398,0.97,4507.369,4514.409,Salvation Army provided transportation to individuals who came to city hall to alternative shelter operations.,56,,
399,0.97,4514.409,4528.991,"And then Lastly, just want to mention, we have received some information that the city will be announcing two in On-Demand outside testing sites in Sodo and North Seattle.",56,,
400,0.97,4528.991,4531.994,North Seattle at the old vehicle emissions test sites.,56,,
401,0.97,4531.994,4538.734,This will increase daily testing capacity by about an additional 1600 people a day.,56,,
402,0.97,4538.734,4557.753,"I understand that they are looking for sites in my district in West Seattle as well, and given the difficulties of transportation during--due to the bridge closure, that would be welcomed news for folks who are residents here in West Seattle.",56,,
403,0.97,4557.753,4584.98,"Public health just released a new data dashboard that tracks key indicators related to Covid and Kern County's progress towards meeting goals around Covid activity testing capacity and health system readiness, there are some of the Metrics that state and local officials will use to determine the steps that the county can take, and I appreciate their transparency in reliance on data and science to guide our plan.",56,,
404,0.97,4584.98,4594.556,You can find the dashboard at King County.Gov/Covid and then use the menu on the left to click on data Dashboards and key indicators.,56,,
405,0.97,4594.556,4595.924,That's all I have for today.,56,,
406,0.97,4595.924,4596.191,Thank you.,56,,
407,0.97,4599.761,4624.82,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, and for--I want to make sure that also it was pretty explicit that even though this conversation is going to happen in Councilmember Herbold's public safety and human services Committee, that there will be, in accordance with the Council rules there will be an invitation to all Council members to attend the hearing so that folks are--have an opportunity to participate in that conversation.",57,,
408,0.97,4624.82,4639.234,"I wasn't sure if we explicitly said that, but wanted to make sure that we did so that folks understand that they are all--that you all are welcome to attend that meeting at the invitation of the chair, correct?",57,,
409,0.97,4639.234,4641.636,All Councilmembers are invited.,58,,
410,0.97,4641.636,4645.307,"Thank you, Council President Gonzalez for flagging that.",58,,
411,0.97,4645.307,4656.852,"Not quite used to working under these new rules, having worked for 22 years under the rules where anybody could attend a committee meeting.",58,,
412,0.97,4656.852,4657.319,"But, yes, please.",58,,
413,0.97,4657.319,4675.57,"I do extend an invitation and welcome for all to attend and my staff, as I speak, are working with your offices to identify a time on Wednesday, as I mentioned, the CPC meets in the morning.",58,,
414,0.97,4675.57,4680.208,There's also Councilmember Morales' committee that meets on Wednesday.,58,,
415,0.97,4680.208,4705.367,"And we, obviously, are seeking the participation of the police and fire chiefs and the exclusive as well as CPC, director Meyerberg and the inspector general judge, so a lot of coordination to do, but hope we can land on time that will maximize participation from all of our colleagues on the city council.",58,,
416,0.97,4705.367,4705.701,Thank you.,58,,
417,0.97,4705.701,4708.136,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Herbold.",59,,
418,0.97,4708.136,4711.74,"More to come on that, hoping to be able to pull that together.",59,,
419,0.97,4711.74,4741.87,"I know there's also a strong interest and intent on inviting folks who may have been out protesting and who can provide us that perspective so there's going to be a lot of moving pieces and hopefully they will all come together and if they don't, then Councilmember Herbold and I will will have an opportunity to have a conversation about an eight part two meeting.",59,,
420,0.97,4741.87,4745.24,Thank you all for engaging in that conversation.,59,,
421,0.97,4745.24,4778.473,"I really appreciate the opportunity for us to talk about this really important issue, so we are going to go ahead and move along through the rest of our agenda, so I am going to go ahead and call on folks now to provide a preview of their city council actions, Council on regional committee work and we will do that in the order of today's role call rotation so that will be Councilmember Morales followed by Mosqueda, Pedersen, Sawant, Strauss, Juarez, Lewis and then I will conclude today's report.",59,,
422,0.97,4778.473,4783.712,So Councilmember Morales.,59,,
423,0.97,4783.712,4786.748,You are up next.,59,,
424,0.97,4786.748,4791.119,There are items from the community economic development Committee on today's full agenda.,60,,
425,0.97,4791.119,4804.332,"As has already been noted, we do have the committee scheduled for Wednesday, for the Bia reauthorization, reauthorization and vote.",60,,
426,0.97,4804.332,4809.704,We will be in touch about whether that time needs to change or not.,60,,
427,0.97,4809.704,4822.45,"I think we all want to make sure that we are able to hear from the Mayor and from our police chief, if that opportunity is confirmed.",60,,
428,0.97,4822.45,4829.925,I do want to address the encampment removal bill from last week.,60,,
429,0.97,4829.925,4842.771,"Seems like ages ago, but last Wednesday did have a 5 1/2 hour meeting to discuss encampment Removals during the Covid pandemic.",60,,
430,0.97,4842.771,4846.942,We did not hear either deputy Mayor address our legislation directly.,60,,
431,0.97,4846.942,4863.859,"We also didn't hear an answer to the question about how they ensure that referrals are happening to appropriate shelter space, and we really didn't hear an answer to the question of what criteria we should be using for Removingan encampment during Covid.",60,,
432,0.97,4863.859,4864.693,We are continuing conversation.,60,,
433,0.97,4864.693,4877.239,"You know, I feel like we didn't get to the deep issues about city policies that caused our homeless neighbors--our neighbors to experience homelessness.",60,,
434,0.97,4877.239,4881.109,So we still need to discuss the parameters of the bill.,60,,
435,0.97,4881.109,4892.554,"We can focus on how to increase capacity through tiny home villages or more enhanced shelter or sanctioned Encampments with--that include services, but this conversation isn't over.",60,,
436,0.97,4892.554,4903.398,We need to also talk about how to support the NAV team in making referrals that are more appropriate and therefore more likely to be accepted.,60,,
437,0.97,4903.398,4916.678,So we know that the real issue is that there simply are not enough places for unsheltered neighbors to go and we also know that merely moving them from one side of the street to another is not a real solution.,60,,
438,0.97,4916.678,4932.26,So I have asked the Mayor and Councilmember Lewis to schedule the meeting that deputy Mayor Fong offered last week because we need to get busy so I'm looking forward to that conversation.,60,,
439,0.97,4952.814,4981.976,This movement began with the stonewall riots and the fury of black and Brown Transgender community members who were tired of being victimized by the police and we did have a flag raising scheduled for this afternoon.,61,,
440,0.97,4981.976,4991.486,I understand and just got notice that the flag raising has been canceled but I do have a proclamation that I will be bringing to the o'clock P.M.,61,,
441,0.97,4991.486,4999.627,Meeting and ask for Council members to sign on . I look forward to sharing that with you.,61,,
442,0.97,4999.627,5003.031,You should have received notice that this was coming.,61,,
443,0.97,5003.031,5007.936,And we will discuss it this afternoon.,61,,
444,0.97,5007.936,5015.043,Any questions or comments on that report?,62,,
445,0.97,5015.043,5021.649,"Hearing none, I will move along to Councilmember Mosqueda.",62,,
446,0.97,5021.649,5024.919,"Thank you, Council President.",63,,
447,0.97,5024.919,5039.634,I want to thank you as the leader of our city Council and the chair of public safety Councilmember Herbold for the opportunity to have that discussion this morning.,63,,
448,0.97,5039.634,5045.74,"I think it was a productive beginning of our discussion, so I want to echo my appreciation for the time that you offered.",63,,
449,0.97,5045.74,5054.649,"Councilmember Herbold, thank you for calling out the things that you have on your list for follow-up including the badges.",63,,
450,0.97,5054.649,5083.812,One thing I would like to tee up is ask a question about who we are morning and I want to make sure we address this correctly and we would love to know who it is we are mourning.,63,,
451,0.97,5083.812,5089.217,A fallen officer was listed in 2009 and perhaps the Website is not updated.,63,,
452,0.97,5089.217,5103.832,But I want to make sure we want to know if there's a fallen officer and I am hoping that is the case but it would be helpful to know more about who it is that we are mourning.,63,,
453,0.97,5103.832,5120.648,I want to thank the Council president for Teeing up the conversations about the Curfew and perhaps the impact it has had in our community . Thank you for taking that up.,63,,
454,0.97,5120.648,5126.554,I really appreciate the opportunity to have those discussions and look forward to more discussions on Wednesday.,63,,
455,0.97,5126.554,5138.132,"For the Finance and housing and select budget committee, there is--there are items for consideration on the full council agenda.",63,,
456,0.97,5138.132,5142.237,We have from Finance and housing--let me start again.,63,,
457,0.97,5142.237,5158.253,Because we have not had our committee meetings and we have taken a piece of legislation directly to full Council and that is the sick and safe leave ordinance for gig workers during the time of Covid.,63,,
458,0.97,5158.253,5162.323,That did not come through the Finance and housing committee and it did not come from the select budget committee.,63,,
459,0.97,5162.323,5166.794,"You asked for an extra week, and I want to thank you for your time and review and feedback.",63,,
460,0.97,5166.794,5180.508,"We have a great piece of legislation for your consideration today that will, I think, make a tremendous impact on the lives of folks who are working in the economy delivering goods and services, driving people around, delivering groceries.",63,,
461,0.97,5180.508,5188.917,It is imperative that especially in the time of Covid we offer them the time to take a sick day and make sure that their time is page.,63,,
462,0.97,5188.917,5220.648,"You have seen numerous Emails and her public testimony over the last weeks individuals who have had to make the impossible decision to go to work because they could not afford to take the day off working as delivery drivers or those who are handling groceries, we want them to be able to stay home when they are sick, so thank you for all the feedback we received from the advocates and people who receive goods and services.",63,,
463,0.97,5220.648,5223.184,We have a great piece of legislation in front of you today.,63,,
464,0.97,5223.184,5237.865,There will be a potential vote on Council bill CB 119793 and it is an ordinance for paid sick and see leave.,63,,
465,0.97,5237.865,5243.771,I want to note that I earlier today sent you an Email and this includes feedback from the mayors office and the office of labor standards.,63,,
466,0.97,5243.771,5251.379,The Office of labor standards had important suggestions and we included their final suggestions in the legislation that went over.,63,,
467,0.97,5251.379,5256.985,We want to thank them for their due diligence over the weekend to catch a few items we have reviewed.,63,,
468,0.97,5256.985,5285.413,"It is ready for your consideration, and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me and I'm happy to answer any questions . I want to confirm that the clerk's office has confirmed that because we sent it earlier this morning, it will be updated for the Substitte to be considered for today . I also want to note the Seattle times covers, which I linked in the Email I sent you this morning.",63,,
469,0.97,5285.413,5297.625,It says that the Six-Day bill would resemble the existing Seattle law that allows for conventional employees to get paid sick leave and other circumstances.,63,,
470,0.97,5297.625,5303.698,Drivers in Seattle would be eligible and get some sick days up front before getting more.,63,,
471,0.97,5303.698,5311.005,The Six-Day pay would be based on the daily average on their top earning month since October.,63,,
472,0.97,5311.005,5313.641,The idea is to ensure that they can choose to stay home.,63,,
473,0.97,5313.641,5316.31,Some drivers work sick because they cannot afford to go without an income.,63,,
474,0.97,5316.31,5323.351,"And the quote from one of the drivers is I want to take a day off when I'm sick, but I need to eat.",63,,
475,0.97,5323.351,5329.19,So thank you for all of your feedback and for the work that has been put into this piece of legislation.,63,,
476,0.97,5329.19,5342.07,Thanks to my staff and central staff and for all of you for your feedback.,63,,
477,0.97,5342.07,5343.671,As far as the budget committee,63,,
478,0.97,5343.671,5360.855,"Before you move on, I tried to establish a clear policy that if we ask counsel central staff to be on the line that we give them an opportunity to make the presentation.",64,,
479,0.97,5360.855,5374.368,So she is on the line I want to make sure she can weigh in on the bill this afternoon.,64,,
480,0.97,5374.368,5384.712,I know you touched on this but we asked her to take time out of her morning today.,64,,
481,0.97,5384.712,5414.108,"If you could let us know if there are additional changes that should be highlighted that have been included in the substitute bill, now would be the time to do that, and before you move on with the report, I want to let people ask questions that they may have about that particular legislative action that is slated for the full council this afternoon . Corinna.",64,,
482,0.97,5414.108,5418.446,", readable with counsel central staff.",65,,
483,0.97,5418.446,5451.579,Things to know about the substitute bill that was recently circulated among Council members and was posted to the agenda is that it is a merging of amendments to the bill that were included in the substitute bill or that was loaded to the agenda on Friday and over the weekend there were additional changes due to feedback from the office of labor standards in the executive.,65,,
484,0.97,5451.579,5469.397,"If you are wondering what these changes are, it would be a merging of the changes in the memo that you received on Friday, or that was loaded to the agenda on Friday, along with the chart that this substitute 5A as well.",65,,
485,0.97,5469.397,5500.328,I think the majority of these amendments reflect requests from office of labor standards to be able to immediately implement this law in a way that does not require them to do Rulemaking and you will see additional definitions and you will see incorporation of the existing rules for employees right now and incorporated directly into this legislation rather than something that would need to be an additional Rulemaking process.,65,,
486,0.97,5500.328,5510.104,There are some pieces in here that would support hiring entities in making this legislation hit the ground easier.,65,,
487,0.97,5510.104,5520.548,There is an addition that would permit them to give them pay time when it would accrue in advance.,65,,
488,0.97,5520.548,5545.973,There would be an allowance to mitigate the cost that would be approved prior to the ordinance by subtracting the amount of other paid leave that they have already provided for paid sick time or save time purposes from that sick and safe time.,65,,
489,0.97,5545.973,5560.855,There are requirements for notice to workers that clarify that the notice needs to be given to them in a way that is accessible via a smart phone in languages other than English if that is something that would be needed.,65,,
490,0.97,5560.855,5593.988,"And then, the most recent changes from the office of labor standards over the weekend would lay out some specific requirements for when workers are paid for their paid sick and safe time and this is modeled on current requirements for employees and it would be that they are paid with the hiring entities choice of 14 calendar days after the requested date of use or the next regularly scheduled date of compensation.",65,,
491,0.97,5593.988,5600.227,There's also a clarification that workers can request consecutive days of use at a time.,65,,
492,0.97,5600.227,5622.216,A variety of changes that are not radically shifting the legislation that gave hiring entities more options and are reflecting requests from the office of labor and standards to reduce the burden of drafting the rules.,65,,
493,0.97,5622.216,5625.353,Thank you for that.,66,,
494,0.97,5625.353,5632.46,Any questions for Corinna bull?,66,,
495,0.97,5632.46,5635.162,No questions.,66,,
496,0.97,5635.162,5663.057,"Thank you for your work--Corinna bull, thank you for your work on this issue and I know we had you sitting on the line for a little over an hour, so I appreciate your patience.",66,,
497,0.97,5663.057,5664.859,That was helpful and informative.,66,,
498,0.97,5664.859,5671.766,"If there are no the questions for her or comments, we can go ahead and let her go about her day.",66,,
499,0.97,5671.766,5676.771,Thank you so much for being with us.,66,,
500,0.97,5676.771,5681.709,"Councilmember Mosqueda, we will go back to you for the rest of",66,,
501,0.97,5681.709,5685.98,"Thank you, Council President.",67,,
502,0.97,5685.98,5690.618,I want to echo my appreciation for her work.,67,,
503,0.97,5690.618,5696.924,She was burning the midnight oil over the last few weeks.,67,,
504,0.97,5696.924,5707.334,"I want to note for the select budget committee, thanks to the Council president for her words at the beginning of this meeting.",67,,
505,0.97,5707.334,5725.152,I want to thank the governor for the extension of the proclamation and for hearing the concerns from across the state from those who are getting to the process of governing and making sure that we have the tools in our Toolbelt to make sure we can have these meetings.,67,,
506,0.97,5725.152,5735.062,A huge thank you to the governor and his chief of staff and the office of Intergovernmental relations.,67,,
507,0.97,5735.062,5743.27,My hope was to do at least two meetings in the first part of June.,67,,
508,0.97,5743.27,5749.11,We will continue working with the Council President's office and make sure we can coordinate those with the new information that has been shared over the weekend.,67,,
509,0.97,5749.11,5760.087,We also know that there will be an opportunity to take a look at the supplemental budget beginning as early as next week.,67,,
510,0.97,5760.087,5784.912,It will be very important to have a conversation with our colleagues about those items as well as we consider the various proposals that Council member Sawant and Councilmember Morales have provided.,67,,
511,0.97,5784.912,5824.318,"And we will be following up with those in the office to make sure that you get those meetings on your calendars as soon as we get clarification we have received information, as I mentioned, that by Tuesday, June 9th, we will see what they are proposing and we want to make sure that you get that information in real time so we will be sending out the proposal as well as a summary of how we will be reviewing that proposed budget and providing inputs and Edits and crafting our legislative response to the 2020 revised budget.",67,,
512,0.97,5824.318,5844.838,"We are working with central staff and the Council President's office and we should have 3 to 5 meetings, perhaps more, based on the conversation and we will be circulating a proposed draft for you all to put a hold on your calendar as well related to the 2020 revised budget.",67,,
513,0.97,5844.838,5856.784,Two very important items and we will have two calendars for you to consider as we look at the strategy to consider both actions over the next month or so.,67,,
514,0.97,5856.784,5864.058,I want to also note that today marks the beginning of API heritage month.,67,,
515,0.97,5864.058,5906.133,"Many in our community, especially those who have been reeling from the disproportionate targeting of racial bias among our community have been experiencing not only the hardship of the economic crisis but also the hardship of the public health crisis being directed at them and we will be doing some efforts to lift up the community and the investments that we want to make in this critical time to make sure that the API community is respected and invested in as we think about who we are honoring this month.",67,,
516,0.97,5906.133,5909.203,"Lastly, just a very quick note.",67,,
517,0.97,5909.203,5921.415,"For those who remember imaging Williams, she came to counsel many times.",67,,
518,0.97,5921.415,5931.058,I wanted to say thank you to her for her ongoing advocacy.,67,,
519,0.97,5931.058,5937.264,Thank you for that report.,68,,
520,0.97,5937.264,5941.735,Our condolences to her family.,68,,
521,0.97,5941.735,5950.244,She will be missed and we send our condolences to her family and friends and loved ones.,68,,
522,0.97,5950.244,5955.983,I want to be clear on Councilmember Mosqueda's report.,68,,
523,0.97,5955.983,5962.856,We will have a need to have a formal summer budget session.,68,,
524,0.97,5962.856,5996.924,"We are working with her office on a Timeline to consider a rebalancing package for the 2020 budget for the forecasted deficits and we have not had an opportunity to finalize what that could look like, but as Council President I want to make sure that you understand that this is a formal request for summer budget session, which is unique given the economic circumstances we are dealing with.",68,,
525,0.97,5996.924,6070.731,"I am grateful for the modifications to proclamation 2028 and I think it will allow us to be more nimble and think about not only some difficult positions we may have to make around three appropriating dollars but identifying potential revenue sources and continue to meet the basic needs and in the course of that we will likely do as we do with budget sessions, we will suspend other legislative actions that are unrelated to the budget while we are focused on the budget and part of that is first and foremost to allow the central staff to focus on the needs around the budget . So you can expect to receive a communication from my office later today or later this week around what can be considered during the summer budget session.",68,,
526,0.97,6070.731,6077.971,This is practice that is in line with what we ordinarily do during an intense budget season.,68,,
527,0.97,6077.971,6095.022,"So we will, you know, have other nonrelated legislative action with few exceptions to allow us to focus our resources--our limited human resources emitted to the budget process.",68,,

539,0.97,6256.75,6259.252,But I was deciding if I should,68,,
540,0.97,6259.252,6276.303,The Seattle transportation benefit district is expiring this year and I think we should renew it and I think we can complete work on a reasonable renewal measure in July so Seattle voters can decide in November.,69,,
541,0.97,6276.303,6285.212,I'm confident that transit Ridership will be a left for commuters and workers of all incomes as we restart our regional economy and transit is fully operational.,69,,
542,0.97,6285.212,6296.189,Until then the funding can be used for key infrastructure projects such as the urgent ridge maintenance that we are hearing so much about.,69,,
543,0.97,6296.189,6316.109,Regarding utilities I was disappointed by the vote from the King County Council that they made to raise rates by going ahead with the Pre-Covid 4.5% increase for wastewater treatment.,69,,
544,0.97,6316.109,6323.417,These rates from King County are passed directly onto consumers.,69,,
545,0.97,6323.417,6341.668,I would like to thank one Councilmember for his effort to delay those . I want to thank the Mayor and the head of Seattle public utilities.,69,,

550,0.97,6390.217,6410.737,The purpose of my amendments is to make sure we achieve our goal of giving small neighborhood businesses a greater voice and making sure there is a competitive process for awarding what is essentially a one Million-Dollar contract . I look forward to more discussion this Wednesday if we can accommodate that.,69,,
551,0.97,6410.737,6434.027,People can continue to Email their comments . I held my office hours again last week by Skype and telephone and I encouraged constituents to sign up on my Website . Thank you.,69,,

556,0.97,6469.596,6480.14,I had some Internet issues.,72,,
557,0.97,6480.674,6482.676,Are there any follow-up,72,,
558,0.97,6482.676,6499.326,I want to think Councilmember Pedersen for his statement related to his commitment to look at efforts to renew the transportation benefit district this year.,73,,
559,0.97,6499.326,6513.106,I wholeheartedly agree that we need to use transit as a way to address many of the impact of Covid-19.,73,,
560,0.97,6513.106,6527.053,And of course there is the obvious need in district 1 not just for reliance on transit but Enhancement on transit during the closure of the West Seattle bridge.,73,,
561,0.97,6527.053,6542.369,I look forward to working with Councilmember Pedersen and other Council members and making sure that we have a commitment from the Mayor's office to bring forward this ballot measure this year.,73,,

563,0.97,6553.98,6571.197,I want to echo Councilmember Pedersen's thanks of the King County counsel on wastewater rates.,73,,
564,0.97,6571.197,6600.527,I worked with members of the regional water quality . I expressed our hopes for more engagement with the regional water quality community on the assumptions underlying the proposed rate increases.,73,,
565,0.97,6600.527,6641.101,And that body that are impacted by these rate changes feels very strongly that this is an ongoing issue that predates this particular set of rate changes and feels that it does not have a meaningful role of input to the decisions--the decisions that lead to the argument that we need to increase rates particularly around planning.,73,,
566,0.97,6641.101,6656.549,They wanted to have a conversation about the capital budget because many of the decisions around rates drive from assumptions around the capital projects.,73,,
567,0.97,6656.549,6668.495,One of the things that we did when I was the chair of the committee of the utilities was a project completion rate that is something other than 100%.,73,,
568,0.97,6668.495,6690.483,Because those departments do not complete 100% of the projects on time and we assumed a 98% completion rate and that is what made it possible for us to bring rates down that is the sort of thing that I would hope that the county did.,73,,
569,0.97,6690.483,6700.026,Thank you to Councilmember Pedersen for lifting up the efforts of the King County,73,,
570,0.97,6700.026,6706.833,Any other comments for Councilmember Pedersen?,74,,

The governor's revised proclamation, tells them precisely [Indiscernible] to have the governor uses emergency powers to clarify for the duration of the pandemic all virtual meetings are an acceptable way for public agencies to meet and legislate.",75,,
582,0.97,6905.598,6925.451,The new proclamation makes clear as we set a may 15th that the March 24th proclamation was unlawful for him to Micromanage the exercise by cities and counties of the powers vested in them by the Washington state Constitution.,75,,
583,0.97,6925.451,6943.97,It prevented cities and counties of fulfilling their constitutionally mandated obligations and for nine weeks in the child Jesus challenges posed.,75,,

589,0.97,7019.145,7048.975,"The last few weeks they said they would not meet and honor the obligations because of the governor's restrictions . Unless members claim that the governor cannot think about our movements, Council members have had an extra three weeks to prepare for the vote and everyone should be more than ready.",75,,
590,0.97,7048.975,7082.008,I look forward to the budget meetings being held this is possible and I think Councilmember Mosqueda for your comments . The delays have had dire consequences . just a month's delay in the effective date of the legislation results and $40 million of taxes the city of Seattle will never collect and money that is not available to the most marginalized households or affordable housing that is now unfunded.,75,,
591,0.97,7082.008,7089.015,This is almost as much as this annual budget.,75,,

We had a conversation about the underlying issues around the problems and inequities that we see the policies and work Collaboratively to make process to make progress and it is an ongoing conversation and I am in contact with Councilmember Herbold as well to make sure we can have a framework for going forward on that.",81,,
698,0.97,8332.657,8334.659,Is an important and critical conversation.,81,,

700,0.97,8347.672,8359.584,"We are holding that bill for one more week to continue to have conversations with Stakeholders and colleagues about potential amendments, so that vote will not be this afternoon.",81,,
701,0.97,8359.584,8382.207,We will wait one more week to make sure that the proposal is Vetted and make sure that everyone can have their say in shaping that . do not hesitate to reach out to have a conversation about potential amendments or concerns or comments on that legislation.,81,,

706,0.97,8425.116,8457.982,"And that Council members that have amendments are willing to share them with us as sponsors of the legislation and it would be great to have the opportunity to do that because we could then, assuming that there is consensus between the sponsors of amendments and the sponsors of the legislation, we could roll them into the substitute bill and I know that it really helps central staff in streamlining things in this compressed Timeline that we have of working through legislation.",83,,
707,0.97,8457.982,8461.653,So just putting that out there.,83,,
708,0.97,8461.653,8464.889,"If you have amendments and you are willing to share this with us, let us know.",83,,

712,0.97,8487.011,8488.413,It will be brief.,84,,

714,0.97,8509.934,8519.143,A couple of quick things that I wanted to mention.,84,,
715,0.97,8519.143,8523.948,I had an opportunity to attend the Puget sound regional Council executive board meeting on behalf of the city of Seattle last week.,84,,
716,0.97,8523.948,8527.452,Councilmember Lewis was also on the line and the Mayor was present.,84,,
717,0.97,8527.452,8564.589,"In that meeting we had an opportunity to persuade our fellow executive board members to Laos additional flexibility with regard to 2020 transportation infrastructure funding . So the proposed project list for 2020 funds included a $3.5 million appropriation for Seattle's one center city contingency list project, and we saw an approval of an exemption to use those funds flexibly in order to support the city's planning efforts around the West Seattle bridge.",84,,
718,0.97,8564.589,8589.814,So the funds would be split to support the planning study and then also still be allowed to provide us some flexibility for dollars for transportation Emand management activities in West Seattle and downtown to help address the reality of the traffic impacts resulting from the West Seattle bridge closure.,84,,
719,0.97,8589.814,8598.923,This was obviously a high priority on our list in terms of Representatives at the Puget sound regional Council executive board meeting.,84,,
720,0.97,8598.923,8606.798,We were successful in that request and we did receive the flexibility.,84,,
721,0.97,8606.798,8623.948,"It is not additional money that was appropriated to us through the process, but it is much needed flexibility that we needed in order to be able to use the funds that met this emerging need.",84,,
722,0.97,8623.948,8627.352,It is great news for us as a city.,84,,
723,0.97,8627.352,8641.866,I want to say thank you to the Puget sound regional Council staff and to the other members of the executive board who asked tough questions but also signaled their strong support for it and we were able to receive unanimous support for that particular funding request.,84,,
724,0.97,8641.866,8660.084,That is welcome news not just for the District 1 representative for the entire city . We know that the West Seattle bridge is critical to move traffic and people through our region.,84,,
725,0.97,8660.084,8678.77,It is a region wide issue and these dollars will be hugely helpful in our endeavor to plan Accordingly so that we can mitigate impacts as we look at next steps related to the West Seattle bridge.,84,,
726,0.97,8678.77,8681.005,I wanted to make sure that I could report to on that.,84,,
727,0.97,8681.005,8693.384,"I also had an opportunity to, the prior week, attend King County regional homeless authority governing committee meeting.",84,,
728,0.97,8693.384,8732.623,"This was the first meeting of the year since the Council approved the Interlocal agreement . We were not able to identify Cochairs, but I wanted to make sure that you are aware that I identified and supported the need to continue to work out some of the issues that were left over last year related to voting and Evidence- based practices and that those things need to be addressed to the bylaws.",84,,
729,0.97,8732.623,8764.489,"I would extend an offer to each of you that if you continue to have concerns about the structure of the regional homeless authority that you reach out to my office as soon as possible to signaled to me what you would like to see negotiated in the bylaws process . I am looking forward to being able to communicate Proactively with those needs are later this week, and then, I wanted to let you know that we are in the midst of considering who will be the Cochairs.",84,,
730,0.97,8764.489,8779.67,"There was a motion to advance three elected officials to be Cochairs . There was a counter motion to have one of the three Cochairs, if they were going to be three copy person with experience.",84,,
731,0.97,8779.67,8820.344,"I supported that motion and I look forward to continuing to support that kind of a model where someone with lived experiences elevated to a position of leadership amongst the governing Committee, even if it is for short-lived period of time, I think it is important for us to make sure that we are centering the experiences of those in that new structure or we will risk the realities of having an entity that is overly politicized and it has too much power centered in elected officials.",84,,
732,0.97,8820.344,8822.814,I look forward to continuing to work through those issues.,84,,
733,0.97,8822.814,8843.067,And I'm available to each of you to make sure that we are faithfully representing the interests of the city council as a whole in those rooms and in those conversations.,84,,

738,0.97,8872.563,8880.471,I will take any questions on my report.,84,,
739,0.97,8880.471,8894.886,Anything else for the good of the order? Councilmember Herbold.,84,,
740,0.97,8902.693,8927.818,In the reporting on Wednesday they reminded us of Tony's friendship to so many in the community and his commitment to justice and to shared access and opportunity to wealth and inequality in our city.,84,,
741,0.97,8927.818,8943.034,"He served as the executive director of the central area of motivation program and he worked for seven years as the executive director of the Washington state Commission on African-American affairs, and during his time in Seattle he Úserved on more than 20 commissions.",84,,
742,0.97,8943.034,8952.376,I want to share the words of Larry Gossett in recognizing Tony oranges passing.,84,,

745,0.97,8982.807,8991.782,It was exemplified beautifully during the period he served as executive director of the Washington state African- American Commission.,84,,
746,0.97,8991.782,9002.126,'s articulation of the finer points of issues was admired by all and lucky enough to hear his clear explanation.,84,,
747,0.97,9002.126,9010.434,The killing of affirmative action was one such issue he worked on.,84,,
748,0.97,9010.434,9014.138,And he did a great job of mobilizing the people to resist those trying to kill it.,84,,
749,0.97,9014.138,9023.614,He could always break down complex issues so that every day people could understand what they were fighting for and we appreciated that about him.,84,,
