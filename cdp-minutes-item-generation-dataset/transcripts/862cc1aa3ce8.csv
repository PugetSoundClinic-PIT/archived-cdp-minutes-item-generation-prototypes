26,0.97,212.445,224.057,We will continue with the Council meeting here with the first item that is suspension of the roll to allow remote participation and addressing the public comments.,18,,
27,0.97,224.057,237.57,As folks know the city of Seattle issued a civil emergency proclamation due to the Coronavirus on March 2ND and the Seattle public health Department have issued recommendations to help reduce the spread of the virus.,18,,
28,0.97,237.57,256.456,In the interest of the safety and well-being of our employees and the community at large the Seattle city council is holding a remote meeting today and anticipating continuing this practice of remote full council meetings through the end of March.,18,,
29,0.97,256.456,264.897,"This policy, however, will be Reevaluated on a weekly basis pending new information from public health Seattle King County.",18,,
30,0.97,264.897,273.172,While the media room does not provide Inperson comment we still do allow from public comments to be submitted via Email.,18,,
31,0.97,273.172,279.979,This meeting is being broadcast live on Seattle Channel.,18,,
32,0.97,279.979,288.488,And in the Seattle Council chambers listening line at (206) 684-8566.,18,,
33,0.97,288.488,291.591,Again the Council chambers listening line is 206-68-4866.,18,,
34,0.97,291.591,301.067,This is available on today's Council agenda and the meeting is being broadcast currently in Council chambers for anybody that is there in person.,18,,
35,0.97,301.067,312.578,We are trying to do this remote at the advice of public health for social distancing policies to reduce the spread of Coronavirus.,18,,
36,0.97,312.578,320.953,There is an opportunity for individuals to drop off public comments with the front desk on the second and third floors this week.,18,,
37,0.97,320.953,334.5,"Again that policy is continuing to be Reevaluated but as far the March 9th, 2020 and the remainder of the week we will have the ability for individuals to drop off public comment.",18,,
38,0.97,334.5,345.978,Colleagues because the Council is participating electronic Cally and comments are not provided at the regular meeting in person the Council will need to suspend the rules.,18,,
39,0.97,345.978,365.698,With that the rules will be suspended to allow Councilmembers to not allow these at regular scheduled meetings but allowed written commence.,18,,
40,0.97,365.698,370.837,The Council rules are suspended and will proceed electronically and will not be on the agenda.,18,,

42,0.97,378.177,398.064,Before we begin I want to also notify the public and acknowledge that Council has received an emergency order from the Mayor on Friday directing the city departments to apply for available state and Federal resources due to the Coronavirus and to ensure that we have sufficient resources to respond.,18,,
43,0.97,398.064,407.573,In my roll as President pro Tem I'm choosing not to bring forward a resolution meaning that the order is accepted and will be in place.,18,,
44,0.97,407.573,424.824,"In the state of emergency, we as the Council will receive many orders from the Mayor's office and it is our job as Councilmembers to review the orders with account central staff and decide whether we need to affirm, reject, modify or do nothing in terms of taking no action on the order.",18,,
45,0.97,424.824,433.065,I will continue to work with central staff on these orders and let you know that it is my intention on how we will act on future orders.,18,,
46,0.97,433.065,441.374,This order today comes before us and we appreciate the Mayor's effort but we will not take action for it to be in place.,18,,
47,0.97,441.374,448.114,This order does not infringe of any civil liberties or upset the checks and balances in the systems that we have in place.,18,,
48,0.97,448.114,463.396,We appreciate the work from the Mayor's office to send the orders frequently and we will be again working with central to make sure that all colleagues have the information that they need about what is in the order.,18,,
49,0.97,463.396,496.529,"Hearing no question moving on to presentations, we are pleased to be joined by the director of public health Patty Hayes, I appreciate you being on the line with us director and we want to extend our deep appreciation to your front line staff and our admiration and respect for how you are respecting the meeting well at the national level as we talk about this public Healthm and appreciate everything you have done at the local level so efficiently and effectively to address the Coronavirus.",18,,
50,0.97,496.529,505.771,In addition to director Patty Hayes we have the senior director Mike Fonk and acting director of emergency management.,18,,
51,0.97,505.771,515.548,"We will turn it over to the Presentors, Patty Hayes and director Mike Fong.",18,,
52,0.97,515.548,529.896,So appreciate the opportunity to be on the phone with the Council and I have been anxiously awaiting to be able to be present with you so appreciate this opportunity.,19,,
53,0.97,529.896,544.577,"I have a Slideshow that the clerk has up that we will be walking through, if you will go to the second slide that is the outline of what I will talking about.",19,,
54,0.97,544.577,546.746,I will be giving you the awareness as of this morning.,19,,
55,0.97,546.746,550.082,We have a press release at 11:00 A.M.,19,,
56,0.97,550.082,555.788,Or round about them with the latest Situational report and I will give that.,19,,
57,0.97,555.788,572.605,I want to talk about what we are doing and the severity of the projections with Covid-19 and move to what we are doing with community mitigation strategy and questions.,19,,
58,0.97,572.605,588.654,Let me start by extending my thanks to you for the support and the words of support that I receive from so many people around our response there.,19,,
59,0.97,588.654,630.262,There is so much that is unknown about the virus and concern and desire on the part of our residents here to do the right I have admiration nor the staff and the workers and the EMS personnel and others that have been bend over backwards working 24/7 on this.,19,,
60,0.97,630.262,632.765,It is a show of appreciation that I appreciate.,19,,
61,0.97,632.765,640.272,If we go to the next slide.,20,,
62,0.97,640.272,650.649,The case count in King County is now as of this morning at 116 with confirmed cases of Covid-19.,20,,
63,0.97,650.649,658.124,These--this is 33 new cases that was reported today and two of these are deaths.,20,,
64,0.97,658.124,667.967,"In addition one person that is previously reported and if counted among the 116, has died as well.",20,,
65,0.97,667.967,670.603,My condolences goes out to the families.,20,,
66,0.97,670.603,678.244,The total number of deaths in King County reported to public health reported to Covid-19 is 20.,20,,
67,0.97,678.244,688.22,"Of the 20 deaths reported, nineteen associated with the life care center.",20,,
68,0.97,688.22,720.72,"Other thing I wanted to mention is that towards the end of last week the guidance from CDC on testing change to open it up basically to anybody, a provider that is believed to be at risk for Covid-19, along with the University of Washington and the Seattle flu study coming Online the testing capacity in King County is increasing quickly.",20,,
69,0.97,720.72,738.504,The reason that is important for the Council to understand is that public health leaves that there is quite a bit of Covid-19 out in the community already.,20,,
70,0.97,738.504,741.907,80% of the people with Covid-19 have mild to moderate symptoms.,20,,
71,0.97,741.907,761.961,They are able to able to manage their lives and maybe not calling their Healthcare provider and it is that 20% that we have seen surface because we were at a state to begin from selective testing.,20,,
72,0.97,761.961,765.498,And that's why this popped first within the long term care arena.,20,,
73,0.97,765.498,773.539,That is important for Council to understand because I don't want you all to be shocked as the numbers double and double over time.,20,,
74,0.97,773.539,781.58,I will be talking about the Epi curve in A. minute but wanted to put that out.,20,,
75,0.97,781.58,800.332,There are eight additional long term care facilities that have reported with cases and working individually as you may have seen with the news or Dennis may have talked to you when he met with the Council.,20,,
76,0.97,800.332,806.639,We have a great CDC team out with us.,20,,
77,0.97,806.639,812.711,And the United States public health core sent a team out in Kirkland.,20,,
78,0.97,812.711,816.816,They have been so stressed over this.,20,,
79,0.97,816.816,827.493,The Washington State Department of health has set up an intercept command structure per our request specific to long term care facilities.,20,,
80,0.97,827.493,851.283,At the end of last week I spoke to the health care authority and pulled in the Hsh to spur this decision to be made because I know that long term care facilities will be at one of our higher risk facilities.,20,,
81,0.97,851.283,857.189,In addition to other places where people that have acute at risk factors.,20,,
82,0.97,857.189,858.791,This was supported at the state level.,20,,
83,0.97,858.791,869.501,I have an outline for you here on what our disease investigation is.,20,,
84,0.97,869.501,891.69,"As the number of cases increase substantially, our capacity to contact tracing for each and every case will soon be overwhelmed and per public health guidance, we will Pivot away from doing tracing for people.",20,,
85,0.97,891.69,908.207,We will be informing them if they have a positive test on what they need to protect themselves and be doing in alerting people so we can get people tested.,20,,
86,0.97,908.207,917.816,There is guidance along with CDC based upon our experience.,20,,
87,0.97,917.816,922.855,In addition in the media.,20,,
88,0.97,922.855,941.34,"Nationally and locally with the needs across the system for personal protective gear, our top priority is needed for the EMS personnel and health care line workers and facilities.",20,,
89,0.97,941.34,972.805,"We have been asking the public, I have heard unfortunate stories from health care provider offices having personal protective gear like masks stolen by folks that are afraid and we are trying to assure the public that the use of masks in public at the home is not necessary and we should make sure that health care providers have that protective gear.",20,,
90,0.97,972.805,977.309,I will talk about community mitigation in a minute.,20,,
91,0.97,977.309,978.31,If you go to the next slide.,20,,
92,0.97,978.31,981.513,"Director Hayes, could you remind folks which slide you are on currently.",21,,
93,0.97,981.513,992.658,I am on the one that has the slide four.,22,,
94,0.97,992.658,1000.599,We are going to send around the presentation to make sure it is at your fingertips and for the viewing public it will be Online as well.,22,,
95,0.97,1000.599,1002.101,So you can follow along with us.,22,,
96,0.97,1002.101,1012.411,"I will ask for folks to hold their questions, if they can, until the end of the presentation and we will go through and make sure everybody gets questions answered.",22,,
97,0.97,1012.411,1013.245,Thank you director Hayes.,22,,
98,0.97,1013.245,1015.948,Thank you so much.,23,,
99,0.97,1015.948,1029.862,"So what you see on this slide, slide 4, is the Epi curve, the purple curve.",23,,
100,0.97,1029.862,1040.839,Our goal right now would Institute mitigation strategies that I will call blunt curves.,23,,
101,0.97,1040.839,1050.682,"As you see the Hashed curve, our goal is to have less of an impact over a period of time.",23,,
102,0.97,1050.682,1073.272,This is what would prevent in China and other places where health care systems are overwhelmed and overloaded because you have great things in place that would prevent the spread of the disease.,23,,
103,0.97,1073.272,1076.875,That is the goal we are working towards right now.,23,,
104,0.97,1076.875,1084.483,What are we telling the public to do if you go to the next slide.,23,,
105,0.97,1084.483,1091.19,We are recommending that people at higher risk of severe witness stay home and away from large groups.,23,,
106,0.97,1091.19,1120.686,This can be the elderly and this could be people of any age with weakened immune conditions and even throw we don't have the science yet to show the link to pregnancy we are recommending supplies to women pregnant.,23,,
107,0.97,1120.686,1128.126,Parents of children should consult the health providers to what is best for the child and we are sending Underdates to providers to keep them up.,23,,
108,0.97,1128.126,1142.174,"The next slide, the second slide that says what the public can do, we are emphasizing and I really appreciate the Council opportunity to speak to the public through the Council.",23,,
109,0.97,1142.174,1145.077,Do not go to the emergency room unless it is essential.,23,,
110,0.97,1145.077,1148.247,Anybody that is sick with Covid- 19 they should call their health care provider.,23,,
111,0.97,1148.247,1153.185,We should have people stay home when they are sick.,23,,
112,0.97,1153.185,1169.701,We are still emphasizing personal hygiene habits that you have heard and to remember there is uncertainty and the guidance is subject to change.,23,,
113,0.97,1169.701,1172.471,We have already been doing that as fast as we can.,23,,
114,0.97,1172.471,1185.951,That is sometimes confusing to the public so I try to get that out as many ways as possible and so the public understands and we are building this response that will inform the whole nation.,23,,
115,0.97,1185.951,1191.156,The next slide is on school recommendations.,23,,
116,0.97,1191.156,1192.991,Lots of questions about schools.,23,,
117,0.97,1192.991,1204.67,We are not recommending that schools Proactively closed unless it had a confirmed case and we individually worked with those schools on recommendation for how long to keep the school closed.,23,,
118,0.97,1204.67,1211.543,Schools have the right to close at an abundance of precaution.,23,,
119,0.97,1211.543,1218.85,And we respect that and giving our best advice for all of them.,23,,
120,0.97,1218.85,1221.253,Why are we making this recommendation?,23,,
121,0.97,1221.253,1251.316,"Based upon the science right now I will see children under the age of nine, internationally, from what I know there is no deaths so it appears that Covid-19 is not a huge risk and indeed what science is finding that under the age of nine a lot of children don't show symptoms and we can't even tell their role right now in the infection cycle.",23,,
122,0.97,1251.316,1261.193,We are not sure and there is many great sciences working on this right now.,23,,
123,0.97,1261.193,1270.335,"But children above the age of nine to 18, our some cases and it seems to be minimal.",23,,
124,0.97,1270.335,1283.281,And not--unless the child would have an underlying health condition not around that are hospitalized and certainly not here.,23,,
125,0.97,1283.281,1300.599,"Schools may not be affected because children congregate and we have seen this in other outbreaks and particularly of concern that many parents who are health care workers, we need them to be at work.",23,,
126,0.97,1300.599,1307.939,We are actually doing some assessment of that in concert with the city to talk to the health care employers on that.,23,,
127,0.97,1307.939,1312.511,Because we want to make this the right decision at the right time.,23,,
128,0.97,1312.511,1312.944,"Next slide, please.",23,,
129,0.97,1312.944,1314.613,On this slide it is called call centers.,23,,
130,0.97,1314.613,1325.123,I want to give you the number of the call center.,23,,
131,0.97,1325.123,1332.931,We have a special phone line triage for health care providers as well as folks that have been exposed.,23,,
132,0.97,1332.931,1336.568,We would like to hear from them.,23,,
133,0.97,1336.568,1345.143,The call center is opened 8 to 7 and seven days a week and I am also giving you Washington state call center line.,23,,
134,0.97,1345.143,1354.853,We want people to just have general questions about Covid- 19To call that line and not clog our lines.,23,,
135,0.97,1354.853,1362.361,The next line is a list and it is hard to read so I apologize.,23,,
136,0.97,1362.361,1366.665,This is what is called nonpharmaceutical guide for community mitigation.,23,,
137,0.97,1366.665,1372.671,You will see the different colors on the left-hand side show you what are the levels that public health has made.,23,,
138,0.97,1372.671,1377.943,"The light purple, we have been doing this for quite a while.",23,,
139,0.97,1377.943,1382.581,And I was reminded this morning that our first case was a Week- And-A-Half ago.,23,,
140,0.97,1382.581,1390.388,We have been working on this for over a month because of the first case in Snohomish County.,23,,
141,0.97,1390.388,1395.827,All of this has happened over the last Week-And-A-Half.,23,,
142,0.97,1395.827,1398.43,I was quite startled by that.,23,,
143,0.97,1398.43,1406.838,Then you will see we have moved into the secondary level.,23,,
144,0.97,1406.838,1415.514,Voluntary isolation of sick individuals and voluntary quarantine of contacts of ill individuals.,23,,
145,0.97,1415.514,1420.419,And we are at the ready to instigate the third level in a bluish purple.,23,,
146,0.97,1420.419,1437.803,We have not had to do this because our public has been extremely Compliant and as we work with them they have a great area of voluntary quarantine and the health officer has the authority to voluntarily isolate or quarantine individuals.,23,,
147,0.97,1437.803,1456.521,"Then the 4TH level is the one where really a lot of conversations with all of our other public health colleagues and CDC, when would we trigger mandatory cancellation of public events?",23,,
148,0.97,1456.521,1461.726,I think we will have more information on that as well as I have talked about schools.,23,,
149,0.97,1461.726,1476.341,The last two at the bottom are what you see coming out of Italy right now especially the Cardon concierge where government orders a specific geographic boundary to be sealed.,23,,
150,0.97,1476.341,1483.782,We are hoping to never have to get to that point here by all of the strategies that we are taking.,23,,
151,0.97,1483.782,1488.153,With that Madam chair I am happy to answer any questions.,23,,
152,0.97,1488.153,1490.555,I know I went through that quickly.,23,,
153,0.97,1490.555,1497.996,Thank you very much director Hayes.,24,,
154,0.97,1497.996,1501.333,"Council and colleagues, are there any questions?",24,,
155,0.97,1501.333,1503.735,Director Hayes I have a question.,24,,
156,0.97,1503.735,1513.111,"You mentioned we are encouraging people to not go to the emergency room if they are concerned about the conditions that they may have, they are worried about their symptoms and to call their medical provider.",24,,
157,0.97,1513.111,1522.954,We know there is a lot of people here in Seattle and King County and across the state and the nation that don't have health insurance and the Council has talked about that.,24,,
158,0.97,1522.954,1530.028,For individuals that may be under insured or uninsured.,24,,
159,0.97,1530.028,1539.971,Would you also encourage them to call your Coronavirus call center if they don't have a medical provider instead of going to the emergency room?,24,,
160,0.97,1539.971,1570.902,"Thank you for asking that question because we are in conversations with the community health centers and what will be their role and how as you know many of those community health centers through actions of this counsel, we have developed strong in Ter relationships with many of the shelters and other organizations such as Plymouth housing, et cetera.",25,,
161,0.97,1570.902,1586.818,What we want to do is try to make people know how to connect and to have the best and quickest advice because the more the call center is snowed with calls the longer people get put on hold.,25,,
162,0.97,1586.818,1593.525,We are looking on how to increase that call center capacity.,25,,
163,0.97,1593.525,1610.408,What I am saying we are trying to get information out into a capacity built so the folks that don't have a health care provider or those that don't have insurance or under insured are not fearful of making these calls.,25,,
164,0.97,1610.408,1621.252,"In addition, we have a backup of the call center for those that are just don't know what to do.",25,,
165,0.97,1621.252,1639.904,The goal is to keep them out of out of the emergency room and keep them from calling 911 and that Seattle fire does not have an overload right now and I know that is concern across the country.,25,,
166,0.97,1639.904,1642.841,Thank you director Hayes.,26,,
167,0.97,1642.841,1654.185,More information about the health clinics coming soon but encouraging folk to contact their health care provider or G to contact a local Chc.,26,,
168,0.97,1654.185,1654.753,More information coming.,26,,
169,0.97,1654.753,1656.287,I know Councilmember Herbold has a question.,26,,
170,0.97,1656.287,1659.591,Thank you can you hear me?,27,,
171,0.97,1659.591,1662.56,"Yes, we can.",28,,
172,0.97,1662.56,1662.827,Okay.,29,,
173,0.97,1662.827,1663.061,Great.,29,,
174,0.97,1663.061,1664.562,I have two questions.,29,,
175,0.97,1664.562,1675.14,One related to the authority of health officers to issue emergency detention orders or to seek court orders for involuntary detention.,29,,
176,0.97,1675.14,1676.741,I appreciate that individuals have been cooperative.,29,,
177,0.97,1676.741,1686.117,I am inquiring as it relates to the facilities that are being se up by King County.,29,,
178,0.97,1686.117,1691.89,Can you talk a little bit how those would be implemented if necessary.,29,,
179,0.97,1691.89,1699.898,I appreciate that they are not necessary but don't know the extent to come the facilities are being used.,29,,
180,0.97,1699.898,1730.528,"This is a concern that I have heard from folks, people that might enter those facilities, might leave and would just like to know a little bit more about public held would interface with them and in more granular details I participated in the King County call related to the top hat facility.",29,,
181,0.97,1730.528,1765.797,"I have concerns that if people are being visited by physicians once a day and their food is just being--drop and go approach that people's needs on a day to day and hour by hour basis can't be accommodated by the single security purposes that might create a condition under which people might want to leave, where they are cooperative or expected to be cooperative when they first arrive.",29,,
182,0.97,1765.797,1796.427,"If we don't have a way where they can ask for their needs to be addressed outside of the ones a day medical visit and drop and go visit for food, I want to make sure that people are made comfortable enough so that they want to stay and we don't have to move towards issuing emergency detention orders.",29,,
183,0.97,1796.427,1796.694,Yeah.,30,,
184,0.97,1796.694,1807.505,"There is a lot in that for me to comment on so if I don't quite hit it all, just I will ask you if I got it.",30,,
185,0.97,1807.505,1809.207,Thank you so much.,31,,
186,0.97,1809.207,1810.608,"Yeah, right.",32,,
187,0.97,1810.608,1825.456,Let me start with saying that public health obviously has a history working in this area especially with our TV program.,33,,
188,0.97,1825.456,1867.899,"We are deploying are the best practices and we have already had experience where one person who was actually an employee of one of our major providers in the county, an employee that was Quarantined was not happy and we actually at that point, not that I would say we would have to do it, we would have to band to do this Dr. Jungan all the time, it calmed it all down until the time was right for the person to come back home.",33,,
189,0.97,1867.899,1884.048,"Please remember that these facilities that we are talking about and standing upper going to eventually be housing all sorts of folks depending upon their situation, et cetera.",33,,
190,0.97,1884.048,1892.023,So back to your question on what we do.,33,,
191,0.97,1892.023,1929.427,And this is an amazing logistics conversation between public health and agencies that will be emerging as we open up these and one reason why it is good that these different facilities are coming on--kind of one at a time so we can work out this Ideally everybody in these places will have a cell phone.,33,,
192,0.97,1929.427,1939.57,"For example, I know that it is important to have people be able to connect with their family members if they have family members.",33,,
193,0.97,1939.57,1947.679,We try to pay attention because being Quarantined as you can imagine is not pleasant experience and we want them to be able to call.,33,,
194,0.97,1947.679,1952.116,This idea that they would only be contacted one time a day.,33,,
195,0.97,1952.116,1959.857,That's not the only way that folks would be able to have interactions depending on what their needs on.,33,,
196,0.97,1959.857,1960.525,So that is not one.,33,,
197,0.97,1960.525,1995.193,Number two we are trying to look at the facility and then look at what are going to be the pro to calls so who is going to be going to that facility based upon our best advice in terms of what needs to be there and the needs of the people and that's an active conversation with agencies and Dchf.,33,,
198,0.97,1995.193,2012.877,And then the issue of on-site pieces is really varies with the area and I don't have anything right now in front of me that really would be Hsd to be able to talk to the council about how that is going to happen on the county side.,33,,
199,0.97,2012.877,2028.793,We are also counting on our facilities management division to help sort that out so we have got the right level of On- site supervision.,33,,
200,0.97,2028.793,2057.655,"We do find historically that we find out when people are wanting to leave one of these places and in the case of our experience with Gb, we have had the time, not very frequently but we have had times to go out and find the individual again and move on isolation mandatory or quarantine.",33,,
201,0.97,2057.655,2061.626,"As you said, it is a last resort.",33,,
202,0.97,2061.626,2063.828,Did I hit it all?,33,,
203,0.97,2063.828,2064.962,You did.,34,,
204,0.97,2064.962,2071.536,One question about the access that people have via their personal cell phones.,34,,
205,0.97,2071.536,2096.427,Will they be given a number specific to their situation so like a hot line specific for people that are in isolation facility and not have to navigate a myriad of for lack of a better word bureaucracy to get help to address any distress that they may be experiencing?,34,,
206,0.97,2096.427,2099.397,I have to Double-Check that.,35,,
207,0.97,2099.397,2111.576,"In the past when we have been working on TV and hepatitis a, that has not been an issue.",35,,
208,0.97,2111.576,2119.016,We are in a large emergency right now and having to deal with people and that is a concern.,35,,
209,0.97,2119.016,2125.656,We are going to have to do the best we can in the circumstance.,35,,
210,0.97,2125.656,2130.862,That is a lot different if it is 20 people than a thousand.,35,,
211,0.97,2130.862,2131.929,Right.,36,,
212,0.97,2131.929,2136.267,Thank you director Hayes.,37,,
213,0.97,2136.267,2140.872,Are there any other questions before we go to deputy Mayor Fong.,37,,
214,0.97,2140.872,2143.04,I have one other question.,38,,
215,0.97,2143.04,2146.744,Please go ahead Councilmember Herbold.,39,,
216,0.97,2146.744,2148.98,Thank you.,40,,
217,0.97,2148.98,2182.98,"As it relates to the ability of officials to order suspension of all gatherings of a certain size, I appreciate that is not something that we want to enter into lightly but I'm wondering whether your guidance, your general guidance around gathering of ten or more people applies the myriad of events that have not been canceled.",40,,
218,0.97,2182.98,2197.695,"As far as individuals that are considering attending sports and other cultural events, this is a question that we are getting questions about.",40,,
219,0.97,2197.695,2201.032,Just from con constituent.,40,,
220,0.97,2201.032,2201.299,Sure.,41,,
221,0.97,2201.299,2210.908,Right now we are operating under guidance of 50 or above.,42,,
222,0.97,2210.908,2217.248,The original number was 10 and 50.,42,,
223,0.97,2217.248,2232.263,The expectation that the event host or company would be responsible to make sure that they are paying attention to our guidance around gatherings.,42,,
224,0.97,2232.263,2245.576,"Looking at the Epi curve, Realtime this week and I think we are looking large at large gatherings.",42,,
225,0.97,2245.576,2250.581,I am so appreciative of Comicon voluntarily canceling.,42,,
226,0.97,2250.581,2250.948,Absolutely.,43,,
227,0.97,2250.948,2254.852,That was of grave concern to me.,44,,
228,0.97,2254.852,2261.092,It feels different than Safeco field.,44,,
229,0.97,2261.092,2262.493,"Well it is not Safeco anymore, is it?",44,,
230,0.97,2262.493,2264.695,T-Mobile where at least we have open air.,44,,
231,0.97,2264.695,2267.498,There is so many factors.,44,,
232,0.97,2267.498,2277.708,We are in conversations with all of the sports team and the arts Venue.,44,,
233,0.97,2277.708,2287.551,There will be more guidance coming out soon.,44,,
234,0.97,2287.551,2290.421,Thank you so much.,45,,
235,0.97,2290.421,2290.788,Thank you.,46,,
236,0.97,2290.788,2291.389,Any additional questions.,46,,
237,0.97,2291.389,2293.691,Please keep yourself on mute.,47,,
238,0.97,2293.691,2304.035,If you're not asking a question or ask it go ahead and yourself on mute so the line is clear.,47,,
239,0.97,2304.035,2328.059,"One last question I would have is director Hayes is for individuals that are being detained, can you remind us how the people in jails and detention centers being tested due to the potential spread in those facilities?",47,,
240,0.97,2328.059,2333.097,So in the jail we are watching for symptoms.,48,,
241,0.97,2333.097,2340.638,"There was a person on intake, the nurse was concerned.",48,,
242,0.97,2340.638,2343.34,This was late last week.,48,,
243,0.97,2343.34,2352.116,And that individual was transported to harbor view and ended up not being symptomatic and okay.,48,,
244,0.97,2352.116,2371.769,We know at some point we will have--my expectation is that I think that we will see somebody who--that is already booked all of a sudden be symptomatic like it happens in the nursing home.,48,,
245,0.97,2371.769,2386.417,So we are actively setting up systems in the jail to quarantine and what we are going to activate within the jail system.,48,,
246,0.97,2386.417,2388.452,Unfortunately CDC has not given guidance out to jails.,48,,
247,0.97,2388.452,2390.821,It may be in process.,48,,
248,0.97,2390.821,2404.368,I may have missed it on my Email today but we are looking to initiate that if CDC hasn't come forward.,48,,
249,0.97,2404.368,2417.481,"The lucky thing about having our great CDC team out with us, we influence the development of those protocols and paying attention to it.",48,,
250,0.97,2417.481,2431.729,"Every person that is coming into booking is being looked at in terms of--asked about symptoms, etc.",48,,
251,0.97,2431.729,2438.369,So the screenings protocol was initiated and we are working on that.,48,,
252,0.97,2438.369,2438.969,"Thank you, director Hayes.",49,,
253,0.97,2438.969,2449.613,I appreciate it and keeping a close eye on the health and well-being on those individuals given our responsibility to care for them while they are under our care.,49,,
254,0.97,2449.613,2461.125,"Colleagues, I appreciate your questions for director Hayes and director Hayes if you do have to go early we understand you are very busy.",49,,
255,0.97,2461.125,2479.276,"At this point we will go for deputy Mayor Fong and thank you for your work to get the information as it develops out through the Council and through King County and through your channels, we will echo the information you send from our Council to social media and through our news letter.",49,,
256,0.97,2479.276,2493.49,Appreciate what you are doing and we hope you are taking care and resting because we know it is critical for you to respond as quickly you are and so incredibly proud of the work you have done so thanks for being with us.,49,,
257,0.97,2493.49,2495.693,Thank you so much.,50,,
258,0.97,2495.693,2496.093,I appreciate it.,50,,
259,0.97,2496.093,2508.439,"Turning it over to deputy Mayor Fong and the executive team, please take it away.",51,,
260,0.97,2508.439,2510.741,Thank you Councilmember Mosqueda.,52,,

264,0.97,2530.928,2539.403,I want to Re-Enforce the remarks by director Hays and I briefly alluded to this in Wednesday's Council briefing.,52,,
265,0.97,2539.403,2546.11,Just to Orient us in terms of how we are thinking about our city work.,52,,
266,0.97,2546.11,2578.809,As public health and the CDC and the Department of health on down provides guidance looking at the best way to--as the director put it blunt the Bell curve as it relates to pushing out and smoothing out the prevalence and the spread of Covid-19.,52,,
267,0.97,2578.809,2596.694,Our job is operation wide the elements on external facing and to the extent possible in our own city operations to compliment those strategies in order to achieve the intended outcomes.,52,,
268,0.97,2596.694,2639.637,Our efforts are tied with the public health direction and guidance and as of right now the director mentioned we are executing on a series of recommendations that they provided as it relates to Mitch Micing some of the size of public gatherings and how our own city departments would implement those in our work force and to what extent we can facilitate that kind of service delivery model and outward facing level.,52,,
269,0.97,2639.637,2645.009,With our departments that have particularly outward facing responsibilities.,52,,
270,0.97,2645.009,2657.054,"We have folks on the front lines, Sbd, fire.",52,,
271,0.97,2657.054,2657.921,And other personnel.,52,,

273,0.97,2661.825,2674.805,We are engaging with those departments closely to make sure that they have the support they need to do the work in the field.,52,,
274,0.97,2674.805,2686.917,I know that Council has a particular interest strategic pieces that we have been working on.,52,,
275,0.97,2686.917,2697.795,One is in the space related to small business supports and the workers and as well as our most recent order related to Federal and state assistance.,52,,
276,0.97,2697.795,2706.103,I will come back and talk about those two elements in a little more detail in the discussion.,52,,
277,0.97,2706.103,2715.012,Councilmembers don't mind as I turn it over to Laural know that I will put a marker on those pieces that I can come back to later.,52,,
278,0.97,2715.012,2727.825,Unless there are questions on the sort of high level table setting I will turn it over to Laural to talk about a few of the operational pieces that are under way.,52,,
279,0.97,2727.825,2728.692,"Great, thank you.",53,,
280,0.97,2728.692,2728.959,Okay.,54,,

282,0.97,2729.193,2730.094,"Hi, good afternoon, Councilmembers.",55,,
283,0.97,2730.094,2735.499,Just want to give you a couple of highlights here and updates.,55,,
284,0.97,2735.499,2746.577,"Last week you heard talk about our emergency operations center, operations and our hours that we are functioning.",55,,
285,0.97,2746.577,2758.789,We are practicing what public held recommends us that we do and making sure that we are Lim limiting our exposure to one another.,55,,
286,0.97,2758.789,2776.507,We are at the mode in the emergency operations center a very small handful of people in the Coc and the emergency operation staff remotely supporting the Eoc and coordinating.,55,,
287,0.97,2776.507,2778.809,It is a new model for us.,55,,
288,0.97,2778.809,2780.711,Today the first day in this mode.,55,,
289,0.97,2780.711,2794.525,We are learning as we go and make sure that we can leverage the technology to make that as smooth as possible.,55,,
290,0.97,2794.525,2800.23,We are still doing our daily check INS with people.,55,,
291,0.97,2800.23,2818.815,In addition to another update that you saw that was pushed out to all city employees that they can TELE work and as well as guidance as individuals to lessen the collection of people in a meeting space.,55,,
292,0.97,2818.815,2825.756,Again those are things we are practicing in the emergency operations center.,55,,
293,0.97,2825.756,2839.57,"Ni to that, we have given guidance on what we as a city and our programs do to make sure that we are practicing the safe behaviors in community members or meetings and programs.",55,,
294,0.97,2839.57,2846.877,Trying to again lessen the impact for the high risk population and having multiple people in one space.,55,,
295,0.97,2846.877,2858.655,"In addition to that, we have briefed on the cleaning efforts that are in place.",56,,
296,0.97,2858.655,2864.494,These type of resources are stretched so our FAS team is doing a great job.,56,,
297,0.97,2864.494,2867.831,Contracting employees to help us with those types of services on a day-to-day basis.,56,,
298,0.97,2867.831,2884.181,"As you can imagine when you go to the grocery store, a lot of the cleaning supplies are disappearing and we are facing same challenges to Resupply those cleaning supplies.",56,,
299,0.97,2884.181,2905.736,"In addition as you heard from director Hayes, some of the things that we are working on in the Eoc is working at different scenarios and director Hayes focused on the nonpharmaceutical steps to be aggressive in mitigation strategies to lessen the impact of Covid-19 to the community.",56,,
300,0.97,2905.736,2923.287,They are planning endeavors that we are doing in the emergency operations center so that involves looking at our own city family programs being that parts Department and library and the Seattle center and what does it look like when we need to Pivot and not offering those programs and the impacts.,56,,
301,0.97,2923.287,2938.268,"Additionally I want to give you a couple of highlights, the expedition hall at Seattle center will be opened up to take an additional one hundred of our homeless population from the downtown emergency services center.",56,,
302,0.97,2938.268,2944.608,We are trying to do everything we can to help provide a little bit more space for those individuals.,56,,
303,0.97,2944.608,2956.119,You know there is a recommendation from public health anywhere from three to sick six feet and expanding that population.,56,,
304,0.97,2956.119,2966.063,The last item that I will touch on is the Cherry Hill bitter Lake and Lake Union village sheltering facilities.,56,,
305,0.97,2966.063,2979.609,We are on a track and hope to get them Online here sooner than later.,56,,
306,0.97,2979.609,2985.248,With that if there is any questions.,56,,
307,0.97,2985.248,2985.449,Okay.,56,,
308,0.97,2985.449,2989.686,"No questions for Laural, then Councilmembers I want to touch on two pieces.",56,,
309,0.97,2989.686,3007.804,I know you have all expressed interest in and in particular I think we have all began to hear about the economic impacts on businesses.,56,,
310,0.97,3007.804,3025.021,"Workers, small businesses in particular resulting from Covid- 19 and we are very--working very diligently to try to pull together a package of actions and strategies to provide some support.",56,,
311,0.97,3025.021,3037.734,"First, I want to thank many Councilmembers that have engaged with us on this topic and we intend to work with you all Proactively as we advance elements.",56,,
312,0.97,3037.734,3056.887,I would like to describe a few pieces in place that some of which may very well require some legislative action and we will be discussing with you some of the timing and details of these.,56,,
313,0.97,3056.887,3058.889,I would say in the next matter of days.,56,,
314,0.97,3058.889,3070.6,"But just to give you a flavor of what we are working on, number one is, there is interest.",56,,
315,0.97,3070.6,3073.603,I know a couple of Councilmembers have raised this.,56,,
316,0.97,3073.603,3106.636,The Mayor has directed us to work on some package that would specifically defer the payments of B and O taxes and other potential fees as well as utility bills for distressed small businesses under the conditions resulting from Covid- 19.,56,,
317,0.97,3106.636,3128.758,Some of that is related to waiving the deferral interest payments and also putting in place a mechanism to defer the payments themselves as to some future time as to be able to weather some of the current economic conditions.,56,,
318,0.97,3128.758,3144.508,"Second is we will be looking at, this is tied in to the second piece related to Federal support, we will be working with small business administration.",56,,
319,0.97,3144.508,3176.373,I have begin to initiate discussions with our professional delegation and SB Aspecifically with regard to how we might expedite small business loans and potentially modify the current exist be administrative rules around the loans as to allow the loans to be forgiven in order to support small businesses through the current economic conditions.,56,,
320,0.97,3176.373,3177.34,Those conversations are under way.,56,,
321,0.97,3177.34,3199.129,Also Council is probably familiar with some of the work we have done familiar through your budget process and our Department of office of economic development creating the small business stabilization program through the crews of community development and block grant funds.,56,,
322,0.97,3199.129,3216.68,That program was already rolled out to to the street in 2019 and we are looking at supplementing that with additional resources in order to make more small business grants available in sort of under emergency circumstances.,56,,
323,0.97,3216.68,3239.369,There is also some very specific criteria related to the use of those funds and how that program can be Operationallized and happy to come back with director Lee on more details on what we are thinking about in that space.,56,,
324,0.97,3239.369,3262.826,"In addition, I think earlier this morning there was the Seattle foundation has announced the securing of Two- And-A-Half million dollars and continuing to work towards building philanthropic and private sector donated resources to be available in this space as well.",56,,
325,0.97,3262.826,3275.071,We are engaged in those conversations in Realtime to understand more how those dollars might be available to specific communities.,56,,
326,0.97,3275.071,3326.956,"In particular also recognizing that some of our tools are somewhat limited in the space as it relates directly to potentially displaced workers under the current economic conditions, we understand that there are ongoing discussions to provide for additional flexibility for--at the state and Federal level for unemployment insurance resources that could be released more flexibly and more immediately in the current context for workers that may end up being laid off or businesses that have to temporarily close as a result of the Covid-19.",56,,
327,0.97,3326.956,3331.061,I want to preview areas that we have ongoing work.,56,,
328,0.97,3331.061,3346.109,This is a Realtime body of policy and operational on right now . At we are working we welcome your continued thoughts and engagement.,56,,
329,0.97,3346.109,3363.827,"Deputy Mayor Fong and Lee by leading our discussions in this space and, of course, always engaged Anthony Areana that we will bring pieces to you for legislative consideration in short order.",56,,
330,0.97,3363.827,3365.862,Thank you very much.,57,,
331,0.97,3365.862,3374.871,Appreciate the update from both of you and very excited to engage more on the assistance for some of our small business.,57,,
332,0.97,3374.871,3385.982,I know Councilmember Lewis has a question or comment.,57,,
333,0.97,3385.982,3388.451,Thank you so much Councilmember Mosqueda.,58,,
334,0.97,3388.451,3391.621,A lot of businesses in my district have expressed concern.,58,,
335,0.97,3391.621,3409.072,"Over the weekend, Anthony was great and the Mayor's office has been Proactive in working with me on being part of the conversation around some of the relief that we can get out there potentially to small businesses in short order.",58,,
336,0.97,3409.072,3422.786,"Flagging my interest to stay part of those conversations and to stay informed I would also say too from what I'm hearing from folks, the layoffs aren't hypothetical.",58,,
337,0.97,3422.786,3440.37,There are businesses that have told me that--I am not going to say who over the line right now but a lot of businesses will be sending people home this week based on the sharp drop off at the end of last week and how that has it is continuing this week.,58,,
338,0.97,3440.37,3453.95,It is a real concern and will have a very real impact on a lot of the businesses across the city and in my district.,58,,
339,0.97,3453.95,3469.699,I appreciate the--the seriousness and energy from the executive and tackling this because I think it will be far more pronounced this week and something that we need to be focused on.,58,,
340,0.97,3469.699,3473.403,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,59,,
341,0.97,3473.403,3476.873,Any additional comments on that deputy Mayfong?,59,,
342,0.97,3476.873,3478.174,Yes.,60,,
343,0.97,3478.174,3478.875,Thank you Councilmember.,60,,
344,0.97,3478.875,3485.782,I wanted to just also reiterate that really appreciate Councilmember Lewis' efforts.,60,,
345,0.97,3485.782,3505.435,He has been talking with our team with regularity the last couple of days and we hope to continue to work with you Councilmember Lewis as well as the other Councilmembers to bring a relief package.,60,,
346,0.97,3505.435,3507.904,Thank you deputy Mayor.,61,,
347,0.97,3507.904,3508.471,There are other questions.,61,,
348,0.97,3508.471,3510.874,Deputy Mayor feel free to Chime in on these if you have new information.,61,,
349,0.97,3510.874,3531.561,We know you were at the table last week and much of this is probably still in development as you noted we are building this plan as we go as we talk about the spread of the disease and limit the spread of the disease.,61,,
350,0.97,3531.561,3538.701,As we see some of the strategies being affected the strategies may change to appreciate the update.,61,,
351,0.97,3538.701,3541.104,We know there is concern for gig workers.,61,,
352,0.97,3541.104,3556.92,One of the questions is what specific guidance is being developed for communities and workers impacted by potential downturns that are not classified as employees.,61,,
353,0.97,3556.92,3564.827,Such as those that are driving--Lyft and Uber and delivering food and delivering groceries.,61,,
354,0.97,3564.827,3593.022,"Also interested in departmental directives to staff, how do we insure that the number of individuals that are coming in through the office in person continues to decrease and what strategies we may have in place to encourage more people to tell TELE commute and we have asked about our protocol as a city vis-a-vis our contractors.",61,,
355,0.97,3593.022,3606.836,Are we doing anything providing training and equipment and so that more people can stay at home and meet the goals that we are setting out for our employees for our employees trying to apply those to our contractors.,61,,
356,0.97,3606.836,3612.575,Those are three areas we have flagged for the Mayor's office.,61,,
357,0.97,3612.575,3613.176,Deputy Mayor.,61,,
358,0.97,3613.176,3625.455,I don't expect you to have answers and working hard on some processes if you did have comments would welcome but don't want to put you on the hook but flag those for our colleagues.,61,,
359,0.97,3625.455,3631.728,I appreciate that Councilmember Mosqueda and thanks for sending those questions along.,62,,
360,0.97,3631.728,3634.831,On contractors and gig workers.,62,,
361,0.97,3634.831,3639.235,Those are excellent questions and I will insert those into our team to discuss.,62,,
362,0.97,3639.235,3644.273,I know that there is some early discussions around the space.,62,,
363,0.97,3644.273,3654.884,I don't have that information readily available but we share your concerns and we will hopefully be able to respond this week with some more information.,62,,
364,0.97,3654.884,3672.769,"As far as Telecommuting, we are in the early stages of implementing our guidance to departments to be active and encouraging a move towards Telecommuting that can given the bodies of work.",62,,
365,0.97,3672.769,3679.275,We will have more information on how we are doing that probably in the next couple of days.,62,,
366,0.97,3679.275,3705.635,"I want to take the opportunity to just mention that we have a new tool to try and have a little better daily at least information as far as what I have been referring to as work force strength that is to the extent that we have folks either out utilizing leave or TELE commuting, etc.",62,,
367,0.97,3705.635,3714.944,To just have a little better Situational awareness how the work force is doing and where they are at.,62,,
368,0.97,3714.944,3734.13,And this is in addition to data that we get as part of our usual two week payroll system but much more useful for us as we respond to the current dynamic situation to have a sense of our work force.,62,,
369,0.97,3734.13,3743.206,"So once we start getting that information with an appropriate Caydence, we should able to give Council some insight into that as well.",62,,
370,0.97,3743.206,3771.1,"And then again because of the evolving nature of both the guidance from public health and our approach to social distancing and community mitigation in the public health response, our guidance on TELE commuting may also evolve here in the coming days and weeks if a determination is made that we need to be even more direct with our guidance than we have been today.",62,,
371,0.97,3771.1,3776.839,So I appreciate your flexibility in that regard but we would like to be able to get you updates as soon as we can.,62,,
372,0.97,3776.839,3778.708,Excellent.,63,,
373,0.97,3778.708,3793.422,We will look forward to that as soon as you have it available.,63,,
374,0.97,3796.058,3796.859,Counsel member Sawant.,63,,
375,0.97,3796.859,3800.329,I have two points.,64,,
376,0.97,3800.329,3812.308,Even if they don't get answered immediately they are important points.,64,,
377,0.97,3812.308,3814.11,Mr. Fong talked about small businesses.,64,,
378,0.97,3814.11,3822.585,In district three it will have a lot of impact for Capitol Hill that is a Hub for small businesses and always in the central district.,64,,
379,0.97,3822.585,3834.397,I am sure this applies to more south of Seattle as well with many communities of color and immigrant owned businesses.,64,,
380,0.97,3834.397,3849.512,In the central district many immigrant owned businesses for sure and a lot of them have called our office about concrete steps that they wonder what the city is doing.,64,,
381,0.97,3849.512,3852.582,As we shared the updates to Mr.,64,,
382,0.97,3852.582,3855.851,Fong about the points made about expediting loans and so on.,64,,
383,0.97,3855.851,3968.864,"I feel that what small businesses are looking for is immediate relief because depending on the length of this crisis, none of us can predict how long this will go on in terms of the kind of length of time that small businesses will be hit by this crisis and so one question very concrete question that I wanted to ask about to the Mayor's office was under the emergency powers that you know the city Council has agreed to with the vote last week is the Mayo planning to take some more urgent act to help small businesses and one thing that comes to light is Evictions and moratorium on some sort of urging owners of the property where the commercial properties and commercial businesses are located for them to be obligated to work out some sort of rent plan with struggling small businesses because depending on how long this goes on, they may not be able to pay the rent because many of the businesses are also just getting by like many of the workers and so you know as we know working Washington and a whole number of individuals and organizations and I have signed on to this myself, Mayor Durkan and Constantine and to the governor that there should be a moratorium on Evictions working families that are renting and I think the question applies to small business owners because manufacture the commercial properties are owned by very big owners, corporations that could weather the storm much better than could small businesses.",64,,
384,0.97,3968.864,3972.001,So that's one.,64,,
385,0.97,3972.001,3977.54,The other question I had was about dining space but I am not sure what that means.,64,,
386,0.97,3977.54,3986.916,Part of it should be just a response to the funding that the deputy Council put in place as part of the budget vote last fall.,64,,
387,0.97,3986.916,3994.39,"I'm assuming that was going to happen any way, not in response to the governor.",64,,
388,0.97,3994.39,4008.204,My question is the Mayor's office under the emergency guidelines going to do beyond was acquired through that budget vote because we are in an emergency situation.,64,,
389,0.97,4008.204,4020.85,Then more specifically is the Mayor proposing something at the end of the month or where the Mayor's office let them stay?,64,,
390,0.97,4020.85,4035.197,That should be the case and I think it is called for in this emergency.,64,,
391,0.97,4035.197,4035.931,Thank.,64,,
392,0.97,4035.931,4048.31,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,65,,
393,0.97,4048.31,4054.283,On your comment related to urgent action and small businesses.,65,,
394,0.97,4054.283,4072.234,"I assure you the Mayor AGREES to act quickly and appreciate your point that a lot the small businesses, what they need right now is working Capitol and rent relief for small businesses is top of mind.",65,,
395,0.97,4072.234,4083.679,We are looking at what is within existing authority within potential range of powers and certainly this is a space that we want to get creative and welcome your thoughts and perspective as well.,65,,
396,0.97,4083.679,4093.189,So we will be working on that piece and can have more to say and bring back to you all shortly.,65,,
397,0.97,4093.189,4124.854,"As it relates to the standing up of additional facilities related to our unsheltered and homeless population, we are definitely actively engaged in the context of the current crisis to look at how we can stand up as much homeless shelter support or housing as quickly as possible.",65,,
398,0.97,4124.854,4159.488,The actions that we took associated with sites that deputy Mayor still emergency operations and Johnson talked about have been expedited with the support to move quickly from a land use standpoint and at the same time the ability to move more quickly under certain circumstances to bring that capacity Online.,65,,
399,0.97,4159.488,4195.124,"Given the size of the population we are talking about, the potential of the challenges that might present themselves with a broader spread of Covid-19 and the potential use of these facilities, we are certainly looking for further expansion opportunities and looking to also beyond our own resources and to the county and to the state and to the Federal Government to assist us for more options.",65,,
400,0.97,4195.124,4214.843,We are working on those front and happy to talk more and bring folks in that are working day in and day out in this space.,65,,
401,0.97,4214.843,4215.311,Thank you.,65,,
402,0.97,4215.311,4234.697,We will have follow-up questions on how quickly we can stand up tiny houses as Councilmember Sawant has talked about.,65,,
403,0.97,4234.697,4235.23,Councilmember Herbold.,65,,
404,0.97,4235.23,4235.598,There you are.,65,,
405,0.97,4235.598,4238.133,I put myself off of mute.,66,,
406,0.97,4238.133,4261.523,"So I just want to underscore the fact that much of what we have heard both with advocates of workers and small businesses, there is a lot of common ground there and I appreciate the efforts of the executive to work on those areas particularly focusing on the areas of common ground.",66,,
407,0.97,4261.523,4270.833,I have been working to try to get information about this small business call that is being organized.,66,,
408,0.97,4270.833,4276.605,I hope that is making or provided to my office.,66,,
409,0.97,4276.605,4291.92,I know there is a tension between the calls but I think the ability to get as much information to businesses is critical and important.,66,,
410,0.97,4291.92,4298.527,I want to underscore Councilmember Sawant's message around seeking rent controls for small businesses.,66,,
411,0.97,4298.527,4320.949,There was a letter that we received last week from the founder of Molly moon as well as 12 other businesses seeking represent control for April and may and I would like to work on trying to facilitate that.,66,,
412,0.97,4320.949,4351.046,"Moving onto the question of helping our own essential workers and ensuring we have equity in allowing those workers to work from home, I think it would help us as the Council to help problem solve around this area to have a better sense from the executive who are beyond the first responders.",66,,
413,0.97,4351.046,4356.618,One area is the Spu and Seattle light call center workers.,66,,
414,0.97,4356.618,4371.433,And I know that there are finite numbers of workers for the city that are able to work from home.,66,,
415,0.97,4371.433,4386.548,From a technology perspective we can only accommodate so many people to work at home and so it is not only the nonessential workers.,66,,
416,0.97,4386.548,4399.695,I have been made aware that people at the call center who are previously allowed to work from home are no longer being able to work from home.,66,,
417,0.97,4399.695,4406.802,I worry that might be because we are expanding the ability for nonessential workers to work at home.,66,,
418,0.97,4406.802,4415.744,I want to drill down on how we can make sure that this is a more equitable approach that we are using.,66,,
419,0.97,4415.744,4422.851,Our call center folk can use the ability that they have used in the past when they have been trying to address call times.,66,,
420,0.97,4422.851,4423.852,To work from home.,66,,
421,0.97,4423.852,4430.325,I know for a fact that we have expanded the ability of this work force to work from homes in the past.,66,,
422,0.97,4430.325,4441.069,And I think that now is the time to look at being able to do it for the current situation as well.,66,,
423,0.97,4441.069,4448.677,You had mentioned as well that you are looking at amnesty or flexibility for utility bills for small businesses.,66,,
424,0.97,4448.677,4458.52,I want to make sure that we are doing that for residential customers as well.,66,,
425,0.97,4458.52,4494.89,"And I also want to flag my ongoing concern around the Council's hygiene, investments and ensuring that we are using the flexibility granted in the most recent emergency order but that I also believe was granted in the 2015 homelessness executive order to address the urgent hygiene needs of people that are living at shelters particularly to hand washing stations and the funding provided for mobile pit stops.",66,,
426,0.97,4494.89,4501.263,Lastly I want to talk a little bit about testing capabilities.,66,,
427,0.97,4501.263,4521.049,I have asked a couple of times whether or not city contracted and county contracted medical professionals in the field who are interacting with people living in shelters have the ability to test individuals.,66,,
428,0.97,4521.049,4528.924,Individuals that do not have primary care physicians and are unlikely to go to public health clinics.,66,,
429,0.97,4528.924,4546.074,We know the CDC has said that people can--that they have expanded their criteria for who can be tested but it is still bounded by a--the advice of a public health professional.,66,,
430,0.97,4546.074,4595.223,"When I asked this question on Thursday, it was unknown whether or not public health providers who are in the field engaging with people that are unsheltered have the ability to get tests for people that they deem to need tests and when I received the follow-up Email from executive staff about this question, it seems that it is--this is still an unknown question and the deferral to me was made to the CDC and to health care for the homeless and this is a question that I would like to the executive's help to get the answer to.",66,,
431,0.97,4595.223,4607.202,Then Lastly as it relates to the power invested in the Mayor that is not exercised and I hope that won't to close businesses in public places.,66,,
432,0.97,4607.202,4635.564,I want to know about how in considering these decisions in the future how the executive will make those decisions based on public health best practices.,66,,
433,0.97,4635.564,4635.864,Thank you.,66,,
434,0.97,4635.864,4638.834,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,67,,
435,0.97,4638.834,4641.37,Mayor Fong any comments on those last items?,67,,
436,0.97,4641.37,4645.807,Can I ask a follow-up question?,68,,
437,0.97,4645.807,4648.076,Go ahead deputy Mayor Fong.,69,,
438,0.97,4648.076,4653.048,Great thank you.,70,,
439,0.97,4653.048,4655.684,Councilmember Herbold I have taken and my team very detailed notes on your list of questions.,70,,
440,0.97,4655.684,4674.636,I will need to get back to you on several of those and we'll go ahead and move them through the folks that have more knowledge about some of the elements than I do.,70,,
441,0.97,4674.636,4681.977,"A few things that I will respond to, our discussion about the deferral in the context of small businesses.",70,,
442,0.97,4681.977,4693.588,"Your point with regard to residents, I believe we have begun conversations about also making those referrals available for residential customers.",70,,
443,0.97,4693.588,4704.299,I appreciate you flagging that and I believe that will be part of the package of actions.,70,,
444,0.97,4704.299,4706.501,As far as testing is concerned.,70,,
445,0.97,4706.501,4726.955,The testing capacity has been evolving in terms of the ability to bring on more capacity to do testing from both University of Washington as well as other private LABS.,70,,
446,0.97,4726.955,4734.863,In terms of how workers apply things it is a good question in particular to unsheltered Úpopulation.,70,,
447,0.97,4734.863,4752.514,"Again, obviously I don't have where we are right now and I will put this into the process to see if we can get more clarity around weather and how that can be available.",70,,
448,0.97,4752.514,4787.015,"And then as far as the questions about future potential community mitigation actions that sort of continued moving up or down and depending on how we look at the nonpharmaceutical and other criteria, we obviously will be looking to public health for guidance and their perspective is key as far as how and if we come to that point, any of those acts are implemented.",70,,
449,0.97,4787.015,4801.53,Happy to take those conversations further and also brief you a little bit more with regard to that as we are all trying to understand these procedures a little bit better ourselves.,70,,
450,0.97,4801.53,4813.508,So I think we have pinned most of your issues and we will do some follow-up on the piece related to essential and nonessential workers ability to TELE commute.,70,,
451,0.97,4813.508,4829.624,We certainly share your concern about ensure that we are both approach that with an equity lens and technology perspective.,70,,
452,0.97,4829.624,4838.833,Member Dasheer has been in contact with you already and we will provide protocol in regards to TELE commuting.,70,,
453,0.97,4838.833,4858.086,I am not aware of the changes to TELE commuting arrangements for call center employees or not but I am happy to look into that with both director Vara and Deborah Smith.,70,,
454,0.97,4858.086,4861.99,Can you speak to the hiking purchases?,71,,
455,0.97,4861.99,4862.357,I'm sorry.,72,,
456,0.97,4862.357,4866.261,Could you repeat the question in that space again?,72,,
457,0.97,4866.261,4877.706,Is it related to the expansion of the hygiene facilities or was there --,72,,
458,0.97,4877.706,4877.973,Sure.,73,,
459,0.97,4877.973,4892.487,"The Council in this year's budget funding we added funding for the expansion of on number of other hygiene related actions, the purple bag program.",73,,
460,0.97,4892.487,4895.657,Allowing outreach workers to distribute the purple bag programs.,73,,
461,0.97,4895.657,4906.501,Previously it was public health facility workers doing so.,73,,
462,0.97,4906.501,4914.409,There is some other hygiene related budget actions related to the systems of Rds.,73,,
463,0.97,4914.409,4944.072,There is a slate of hygiene related items and not just budget related items but Council President pro Tem Mosqueda has been very vocal on seeking additional hand washing stations throughout the city and want to know whether or not the Mayor's emergency powers are being used to facilitate those needs.,73,,
464,0.97,4944.072,4945.54,Yes.,74,,
465,0.97,4945.54,4946.308,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,74,,
466,0.97,4946.308,4957.886,Those obviously items subsequent to to the Council budget action has been in place in the planning process from our human services Department.,74,,
467,0.97,4957.886,4970.098,"In light of the current emergency response, we certainly need to probably Pivot and look at the deployment of those resources perhaps on a more expedited time line in some fashion in the hygiene space.",74,,
468,0.97,4970.098,4981.91,I would like to pull our team together to be able to take a closer look at the range of options and come you and your colleagues on the Council with some thinking in that space shortly.,74,,
469,0.97,4981.91,4985.914,So if you will give me a little bit of time.,74,,
470,0.97,4985.914,4989.951,Some of the discussions that were happening I know included public health.,74,,
471,0.97,4989.951,4997.826,"As you can imagine as they have moved and shifted into crisis response, some of that planning is actually needs to Pivot as well.",74,,
472,0.97,4997.826,5006.601,So I commit to you that we will be back with a discussion on those hygiene resources shortly.,74,,
473,0.97,5006.601,5007.569,Thank you very much.,75,,
474,0.97,5007.569,5018.446,Councilmembers I will have Councilmember Sawant do one question and we will move onto the rest of the agenda.,75,,
475,0.97,5018.446,5019.314,"Councilmember Sawant, another question.",75,,
476,0.97,5019.314,5023.218,I want to speak about the North Lake village.,76,,
477,0.97,5023.218,5032.327,I don't that was responded to and I was wondering if you could speak to that.,76,,
478,0.97,5032.327,5039.768,Councilmember Sawant I will have to talk to Jason Johnson and deputy Mayor fits Miller.,77,,
479,0.97,5039.768,5043.004,They have been working on that issue.,77,,
480,0.97,5043.004,5046.708,I don't have any issue to update you at this time.,77,,
481,0.97,5046.708,5055.483,From your perspective it has been clear and I will take that back to them.,77,,
482,0.97,5055.483,5058.853,Thank you very much deputy Mayor.,78,,
483,0.97,5058.853,5061.89,Many people will be interested in that so thank you in following up with the whole Council.,78,,
484,0.97,5061.89,5087.882,I do want to also NOTE we have had the opportunity to chair Seattle city light for the past two years and really appreciate Mayor Pederson's leadership given the nexus of the policy issues that these two entities deal with and now as individuals that are residents and businesses asking questions about public utilities to be addressed.,78,,
485,0.97,5087.882,5109.838,From our past work at Seattle city light we had the chance to work with the director and her team in making sure that practice of not just connecting customers was not changed and that we continue to ensure that everyone kept their lights on as of kind of a Promptness and commitment and public utility.,78,,
486,0.97,5109.838,5129.224,I know that chair Pederson's office has been engaged in some initial conversations that we had started this morning with Seattle city light to very much share with the public and with the Council the status of that policy but I want to make sure folks know we have a great team at Seattle city light as chair Pederson knows.,78,,
487,0.97,5129.224,5139.934,Their practice of not Disconnecting customers will continue especially as they address the large and potentially erroneous bills that people had called us about.,78,,
488,0.97,5139.934,5146.407,There is an audit continuing and we still have that policy in place of not Disconnecting any customers.,78,,
489,0.97,5146.407,5158.353,Nobody should receiving shut off notices and the customers at the team is helping customers that may have late bills from previous questions from larger than expected bills being sent.,78,,
490,0.97,5158.353,5170.398,There's a customer team that is set up and so we are excited to hear more from Seattle city light and chair Pederson.,78,,
491,0.97,5170.398,5206.134,You can make sure that information gets out and something that is a good public service announcement that people should not worry about and thanks to our friend at Seattle city light and thank you to chair Pederson.,78,,
492,0.97,5206.134,5217.512,And Council her Bol has been working on that and Councilmember Pederson will work on that as well.,78,,
493,0.97,5226.187,5231.693,Thank you for being with us today.,78,,
494,0.97,5231.693,5235.363,We will plan on trying to have a portion of our agenda for updates.,78,,
495,0.97,5258.019,5268.096,Thank you Councilmembers.,79,,
496,0.97,5268.096,5273.801,Before I move on with the approval of the minutes I believe you had a question about public comment that pretty much our clerks can help address?,80,,
497,0.97,5273.801,5323.751,I just had a question about our public comment in light of not knowing how long we might have to use--format and if our staff were going to look into how we could provide--perhaps it could be done with not too much effort and I wanted to thank all the staff for making today's meeting work but just the question out there and maybe you can follow up on it.,81,,
498,0.97,5332.293,5373.401,I will take a stab at that and if there is anybody from the clerk's office who would like to Chime in you are more than welcome to we also inquired this morning about a potential call line or message line where individuals could leave a message or call and talk to someone I think the big question for us is around staffing we want to make sure that people can implement our Telecommuting policy and not come into our office there was a question around who would be able to staff such a line and be able to turn around those questions so I think your question is a really good one and know that a lot of work is being done making sure that the staffing at home components of that concept clerks if you are able to Chime in and you have anything else please do let us know or if it is just a work in progress you are also welcome to let us know that and we can also follow-up with the customers on the progress of the Tele-Testimony line afterward.,82,,
499,0.97,5373.401,5374.802,This is Ian Smith the technology manager.,83,,
500,0.97,5374.802,5392.42,We did look at that and we are little bit concerned about allowing the Skype law call publicly on the off chance that it could bring down the system that is being used for other critical services right now.,83,,
501,0.97,5392.42,5395.223,We are looking at that and we will get back to you on it.,83,,
502,0.97,5395.223,5431.759,More to come on that and Councilmembers again we are going to evaluate the policy every week to make sure that it is accessible to the public and if there is any more information that comes from--that informs our policy for the next 2 to 3 weeks we will make sure to update our practices but I think--we want to make sure that public comment is easy and accessible even during these times where we are implementing public health recommendations for social distancing.,84,,
503,0.97,5431.759,5432.627,Thank you for that question.,84,,
504,0.97,5432.627,5443.171,Hearing no additional questions I am going to move on to a need to improve the minutes approve the minutes.,84,,
505,0.97,5443.171,5480.241,There are no minutes for today's approval so I will move to the adoption of the referral calendar I move to adopt the proposed--I also have an amendment for you to consider I would like to move to amend the introduction and referral calendar by introducing bill number--this is an ordinance related to --,84,,
506,0.97,5496.524,5506.868,Do I have a second?,85,,
507,0.97,5515.009,5515.443,Second.,86,,
508,0.97,5515.443,5645.006,It has been moved and Seconded before we vote I want to take a quick second to comment on this colleagues this is an ordinance I mentioned a few times last week that I would be interested in bringing forward for your consideration again it is not for vote today this would just be to amend the introduction of referral calendar as we have talked about over the last few weeks there has been a number of Childcare facilities Daycare and some schools that have closed out of an abundance of caution to provide extra cleaning or in any case they have any concerns about individuals who have been exposed we greatly appreciate these organizations for closing their doors out of an abundance of caution those closures have not been mandated by a public official and in the situation right now under existing ordinance for an individual to be able to access sick leave when their child's school closes they would need to have it closed by a public official so the intent here is to strike the language specifically to attendance at school and place of care like a Childcare facility so that if that lace of care closes the Childcare or a school closes then a parent as a worker could under existing city lost take a sick and safe day according to the law I believe there is a number of organizations out there that have been willing and happily willing to give employees a paid sick and safe day if their child's school closes but we also want to make sure this is protected under ordinance it is a fairly small change we did send around version 1 see that limits the change to attendance school closure there is a number of things we would all like to do and given the many stories we have heard the small scope issued specifically to deal with Childcare facilities closing out of an abundance of caution and not under a public official directive that would allow more parents to be able to take that sick and safe leave happy to have more conversation about it throughout the week but that is the background on the bill and hoping with your agreement that we can include it in today's introduction and referral calendar are there any other comments and questions?,87,,
509,0.97,5645.006,5653.748,Hearing on all of those in favor of amending the introduction and referral calendar to include--please vote I.,87,,
