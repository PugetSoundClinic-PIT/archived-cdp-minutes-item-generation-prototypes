45,0.97,242.241,242.642,Good morning.,20,,
46,0.97,242.642,244.477,It is a pleasure to be here today.,20,,
47,0.97,244.477,253.686,Just a little bit of a history you probably all snow and are aware of that both the ports of Seattle and Tacoma are over 100 years old.,20,,
48,0.97,253.686,255.588,The Northwest Seaport alliance is six years old.,20,,
49,0.97,255.588,264.564,The five commissioners from both the ports of Seattle and Tacoma make up the members of our alliance.,20,,
50,0.97,264.564,278.011,"We handle about--over 30--excuse me, 3 million Eeus or containers each year that move from our vessels to the docks and end up going to local stores and business across Washington state.",20,,
51,0.97,278.011,283.85,About half of our imports are transported to the Midwest Chicago and beyond.,20,,
52,0.97,283.85,289.622,Our gate way moves also exports from Idaho and North Dakota.,20,,
53,0.97,289.622,300.533,"Our top export commodities include hay, refrigerated potatoes which are mostly French Fries.",20,,
54,0.97,300.533,301.1,"Apples, cherries and beyond.",20,,
55,0.97,301.1,317.55,"Our gate way is proud to be a creator of over 58,000--[Indiscernible] the goods that move across our docks require jobs at the port and beyond including warehousing, the Prancer Toation sector and retail.",20,,
56,0.97,317.55,324.791,Each job that the port hires creates 2.9 additional needed jobs through our economy.,20,,
57,0.97,324.791,335.435,All together our gate way brings about 12.4 billion dollars in economic impact to our State and adds another $136 million for tax revenue.,20,,
58,0.97,335.435,339.806,I would now like to pass it over the my Co-Chair Fred Felleman.,20,,
59,0.97,339.806,343.343,"Thank you, Dick and thank you Council President Gonzalez and Ãšcouncil members.",21,,
60,0.97,343.343,363.429,This is a great opportunity to share some major Maritime infrastructure investments we are making in Seattle and Tacoma and realize these efforts enable us to preserve and build ton cultural fabric and the economic fabric that put these cities on the map along the deep and protective water ways which are natural harbors.,21,,
61,0.97,363.429,375.174,One of the great strengths of the forming of the alliances is we are able to share the cost as well as the benefits of making these strategic investments which are huge and generational in nature.,21,,
62,0.97,375.174,378.611,They serve the entire region and the state.,21,,
63,0.97,378.611,386.486,Over the past six years alliances have invested more than $1 billion in infrastructure projects.,21,,
64,0.97,386.486,393.226,"They bring more jobs into the region and one of our great competitors is to the North, another country called Canada.",21,,
65,0.97,393.226,420.052,You likely read in the times editorial yesterday that under scores the importance of improving the efficiency of our Marine cargo operations to meet the surge and demand on the West Coast when spending habits have changed from brought on by Covid from services like dining out and travel to home repair and Online shopping and we really are the only port on the West Coast that is positioned to build on this new container capacity to meet this demand.,21,,
66,0.97,420.052,432.865,We have invested in modernization both in Tacoma with eight new cranes at Husky terminal in Tacoma as well as we are underway with this half billion dollar investment in terminal 5 which we will hear more about shortly.,21,,
67,0.97,432.865,458.257,"In addition to these Infratruck #14Ur developments we need recognize the importance of investing in Sustainability efforts and this includes the alliance and the port of Seattle, port of Tacoma and port of Vancouver--port authority in British Columbia which we are really committed now to updating the Northwest ports clean air strategy which puts us on this collective path for zero emissions by 2050 or sooner.",21,,
68,0.97,458.257,482.648,We plan to make these efforts with several initiatives that are already underway including sure power capabilities where vessels can plug into the power while at our Internationl container terminals as well as a critical partnership with the city light to make sure there is enough Elek drinks toy--electricity to go around to meet our needs.,21,,
69,0.97,482.648,492.492,This alongside with reducing truck emissions--these near port communities which are directly impacted by these broadly beneficial activities.,21,,
70,0.97,492.492,500.633,So we are particularly excited to update you on terminal 5.,21,,
71,0.97,500.633,517.149,I know you have some familiarity with this but your recent vote to support the development of the rail quiet zone and special nod the transportation chair Pedersen and Council member Herbold for your leadership in this effort which again will enable us to be better neighbors.,21,,
72,0.97,517.149,526.626,The managing members made decisions several years ago to invest in modernizing T-5 to serve the largest container ships in the Trans Pacific trade.,21,,
73,0.97,526.626,529.295,This is a unique add Van Fooj our gate way.,21,,
74,0.97,529.295,535.668,We don't grow in volume the economic impact these else Haves can move more cargo per ship.,21,,
75,0.97,535.668,542.074,I will turn it over to John Wolfe to share more details on terminal 5 project.,21,,
76,0.97,542.074,546.245,Thanks again for this opportunity.,21,,
77,0.97,546.245,546.812,"Thank you, Commissioner.",22,,
78,0.97,546.812,548.481,Again thank you Council members for your time today.,22,,
79,0.97,548.481,555.087,I will share with you a little bit more about terminal 5 and our Seattle harbor.,22,,
80,0.97,555.087,564.23,Before I do that you are probably aware of the significant congestion problems the global supply chain is facing today.,22,,
81,0.97,564.23,569.135,I want to touch on that first.,22,,
82,0.97,569.135,583.382,It is unprecedented times as we wrestle with the global pandemic and we are seeing unprecedented volume of import cargo coming through our West Coast ports.,22,,
83,0.97,583.382,599.832,"It has caused heavy stress on the supply chain and that shows up in ways where you might see large container vessels at anchor, out in Elliot Bay and other harbors in and around there.",22,,
84,0.97,599.832,606.439,Other terminal congestion is at an all time high.,22,,
85,0.97,606.439,610.743,"The railroads that--are at capacity, over capacity.",22,,
86,0.97,610.743,615.414,The trucking system is taxed to the limit.,22,,
87,0.97,615.414,619.185,Our warehouse distribution centers are essentially full.,22,,
88,0.97,619.185,636.168,We are--also in time of year where we call peak season where the retailers are trying to move inventory into the marketplace.,22,,
89,0.97,636.168,637.703,That exacerbates the problem.,22,,
90,0.97,637.703,639.972,Know that we are on top of it.,22,,
91,0.97,639.972,659.725,"We are doing everything we can as a--Northwest Seaport alliance team, our Commission and we formed a task force with many of our supply chain stake holders that are working Besidetous resolve these issues day in and day out.",22,,
92,0.97,659.725,667.299,We have established some near dock storage facilities you might look out over the Seattle harbor and think that terminal 5 is operating today.,22,,
93,0.97,667.299,685.618,Well in a since it is in terms of we are shuttling boxes from terminal 18 and terminal 30 over to terminal 5 to Decon guest those other terminals taking vessels where T-5 is yet--to take a vessel into that terminal.,22,,
94,0.97,685.618,691.29,"Yet there is about 8,000 boxes sitting at terminal 5.",22,,
95,0.97,691.29,701.801,In addition to that terminal 46 over on the downtown Seattle side is also now holding storage of containers to take the edge off these busy terminals.,22,,
96,0.97,701.801,721.22,"Those are--that is just one example of many where we are working with our logistics partners, our importers to try to increase the velocity and the movement of cargo and its a real challenge.",22,,
97,0.97,721.22,721.887,"Next slide, please.",22,,
98,0.97,721.887,740.439,"That--really highlights the need for additional terminal space and as commissioners highlighted, we invested heavily in a major terminal in the Tacoma harbor a couple of years ago and now we are--wrapping up the first phase of investment in terminal 5 here this Seattle.",22,,
99,0.97,740.439,745.678,This is going to be critical new capacity.,22,,
100,0.97,745.678,764.363,We are one of the few ports really in--all of North America that is able to add significant new terminal capacity so that is a unique advantage we have as respects to this very busy marketplace.,22,,
101,0.97,764.363,770.836,Our cargo volumes are up over 18% as compared to last year.,22,,
102,0.97,770.836,779.645,Really nearing volumes that we have seen at the height of the gate way back in 2018-2019.,22,,
103,0.97,779.645,784.583,We have seven new container services calling our gate way.,22,,
104,0.97,784.583,787.319,"Some of those are calling to Seattle, some in Tacoma.",22,,
105,0.97,787.319,795.127,"If we had more cargo terminal space, we would likely see even more services calling our gate way.",22,,
106,0.97,795.127,816.415,"The good news in that is of course it fulfills the mission of the Seaport alliance in creating family waged job opportunities for those who live in our community whether they are long shore jobs, jobs in the trucking and warehouse business, the retail business and railroad business.",22,,
107,0.97,816.415,822.521,And then of course we are also a major gate way for exports.,22,,
108,0.97,822.521,827.793,We have one of the largest exports of volume moving through our gate way.,22,,
109,0.97,827.793,837.436,That is a result of the agricultural products that are growing over in Eastern Washington and adjoining States.,22,,
110,0.97,837.436,856.555,So we also serve the upper Midwest and as you are probably aware a significant portion of our cargo moves Inland via rail and the good news for that is that--it reduce the number of trucks on our local streets and highways which we all know are highly congested.,22,,
111,0.97,856.555,868.901,"In fact for every train, full rain that leaves our port with those loaded containers moving to the upper Midwest it reduces the truck traffic by 250 trucks.",22,,
112,0.97,868.901,878.11,So it is also a more environmentally friendly way to move cargo.,22,,
113,0.97,878.11,878.944,"Next slide, please.",22,,
114,0.97,878.944,886.619,So real quick touch on some of the high points of terminal 5.,22,,
115,0.97,886.619,892.691,What is driving our terminal redevelopment is the industry has moved to much larger vessels than in the past.,22,,
116,0.97,892.691,917.449,"So to be able to handle this cargo and create the jobs and economic activity that we enjoy here in the region, we must update our facilities and so we are spending about $390 million over capital combined with private sector capital north of half a billion dollars into terminal 5.",22,,
117,0.97,917.449,922.554,You problem slip seen on the Skyline the four new super post screens.,22,,
118,0.97,922.554,925.758,Those are the largest cranes on the West Coast.,22,,
119,0.97,925.758,931.53,They will be able to handle larger vessels that call our gate way.,22,,
120,0.97,931.53,938.671,And that--those larger vessels can handle much more cargo with fewer vessel calls.,22,,
121,0.97,938.671,941.106,There is some environmental advantages there.,22,,
122,0.97,941.106,956.488,"So, it is an interesting time in the industry and all of the major ports are making these types of investments so that they can respond to the changes in the marketplace.",22,,
123,0.97,956.488,957.189,"Next slide, please.",22,,
124,0.97,957.189,970.169,"More specifically as we look at Ãšterminal 5 and the investments we are making in terminal 5, we are making--improvements to the dock, Yale Redeveloping the dock.",22,,
125,0.97,970.169,977.943,The strength of the dock in its previous exist event wasn't able to with stand weight of those larger cranes.,22,,
126,0.97,977.943,981.847,We had to rebuild the dock and the Crane rails.,22,,
127,0.97,981.847,993.125,We to work on the slope stabilization beneath the water.,22,,
128,0.97,993.125,1013.612,We had to improve the and Kis bugs to the terminal and I want to high light the good news is that will allow us to move towards E--[Indiscernible] we will work closely with our normal operator to move in that direction.,22,,
129,0.97,1013.612,1019.518,We have had to upgrade our storm water system.,22,,
130,0.97,1019.518,1031.83,We certainly want to be responsive to this storm water that flows into Elliot Bay and so that $30 million plus just in the storm water system.,22,,
131,0.97,1031.83,1036.668,"It is a state of the Ark system, best in class.",22,,
132,0.97,1036.668,1042.04,We have updated our Marine buildings.,22,,
133,0.97,1042.04,1051.183,We handle a lot of Refrigerative cargo.,22,,
134,0.97,1051.183,1051.55,Next slide.,22,,
135,0.97,1051.55,1059.391,So when we are finished here we will have about 185 acres of Redeveloped capacity.,22,,
136,0.97,1059.391,1066.999,The other aspect of this terminal that is critically important to our customers is to have an On-Dock rail system.,22,,
137,0.97,1066.999,1072.671,Terminal 5 has one of the better on dock rail systems within our gate way.,22,,
138,0.97,1072.671,1081.947,The importance of that is--over 50% of our Inbound car go moves Inland via rail.,22,,
139,0.97,1081.947,1085.25,Having that in place is critically important.,22,,
140,0.97,1085.25,1089.788,Right now at terminal 18 as an example there is an On-Dock rail infrastructure there.,22,,
141,0.97,1089.788,1107.806,Yet it is not able to hold all of the volume that is moving through so we have to--[Indiscernible] moving from rail--to rail from terminal 18 over to the yard on the East side and of course that puts more trucks on the road.,22,,
142,0.97,1107.806,1119.751,With terminal 5 opening we will be able to handle that rail volume without their containers leaving the terminal by truck.,22,,
143,0.97,1119.751,1140.205,"I mentioned the other refrigerated plugs, the short power and--[Indiscernible] it is a protected zone where they don't have to blow their Horn.",22,,
144,0.97,1140.205,1150.148,It is responding to the sensitivity of our neighbors on the West Seattle side.,22,,
145,0.97,1150.148,1154.086,Phase 1 will open here just around the end of the year.,22,,
146,0.97,1154.086,1159.224,Then phase 2 is targeted for the beginning of 2023.,22,,
147,0.97,1159.224,1168.1,So we are really excited about this opening and our customers are very excited.,22,,
148,0.97,1168.1,1168.4,Next slide.,22,,
149,0.97,1168.4,1173.472,Talked a little bit about shore power.,22,,
150,0.97,1173.472,1192.291,The advantage is with that investment in shore power the vessels that call this terminal that have the capability to plug in to shore power will do so and the advantage is they won't be burning their diesel engines.,22,,
151,0.97,1192.291,1202.935,This is an investment that our Commission has committed to not just at terminal 5 but also all of our international container terminals in both hard Bors.,22,,
152,0.97,1202.935,1209.541,I touched on the On-Dock rail so I won't--touch on that again.,22,,
153,0.97,1209.541,1211.21,Then the storm water system.,22,,
154,0.97,1211.21,1213.045,We did receive some state grant money.,22,,
155,0.97,1213.045,1225.824,We want to thank the state of Washington for their commitment on supporting our investments.,22,,
156,0.97,1225.824,1226.258,"Next slide, please.",22,,
157,0.97,1226.258,1233.665,And then finally you all are very familiar with the West Seattle bridge and certainly we are as well.,22,,
158,0.97,1233.665,1241.139,That is part of the infrastructure that makes terminal 5 and terminal 18 work.,22,,
159,0.97,1241.139,1246.144,So we really appreciate the partnership with Sdot and the city.,22,,
160,0.97,1246.144,1247.846,We are doing our part.,22,,
161,0.97,1247.846,1265.697,I Mow the port of Seattle is looking at making commitment to help offset the cost of that repair and certainly that we want to support you all and have with looking for grant dollars both at the state and Federal level.,22,,
162,0.97,1265.697,1276.441,This--that lower bridge is going to be critical for us for the--that truck traffic that does access terminal 5.,22,,

169,0.97,1360.092,1361.827,That you highlighted.,23,,
170,0.97,1361.827,1368.9,That is something I hear from small business owners and others a lot about.,23,,
171,0.97,1368.9,1382.314,I--I suppose I hadn't necessarily appreciated the import--the sort of significance of the role you all were playing in helping to address some of those concerns so appreciated an update on those efforts.,23,,

179,0.97,1420.152,1429.227,The work you have done to make sure we have additional places for those who are experiencing homelessness to be able to go.,24,,
180,0.97,1429.227,1431.363,The port has been an important partner.,24,,
181,0.97,1431.363,1452.484,You have stepped up in ways that our region is looking for and I hope that the city of Seattle will do more to deploy the resources that have been allocated and also given to us by our state partners and with assistance from the Federal--to deploy the dollars we have passed into law to be a better Senator near with you all.,24,,
182,0.97,1452.484,1471.803,Wanted to say thank you for that way you are taking care of our community and as a neighbor to T-5 appreciate the work you are doing activate that port and also the work you are doing around additional sound barriers.,24,,
183,0.97,1471.803,1474.739,That will be great asset.,24,,
184,0.97,1474.739,1476.041,It is exciting.,24,,
185,0.97,1476.041,1480.111,This is helping our country as well recover.,24,,
186,0.97,1480.111,1485.05,Looking forward to continuing to be a partner in anyway.,24,,
187,0.97,1485.05,1493.625,My Favorte Park is--[Indiscernible] thanks for all the work you have done to activate the terminal while preserving public places for folks to go.,24,,
188,0.97,1493.625,1496.761,Looking forward to more partnerships with you all like that.,24,,
189,0.97,1496.761,1499.731,Thanks for helping to make our area even greener.,24,,
190,0.97,1499.731,1501.199,Thank you.,25,,
191,0.97,1501.199,1507.205,"Thank you so much, council member Mosqueda.",26,,
192,0.97,1507.205,1511.409,I see Council member Herbold has her hand up.,26,,
193,0.97,1511.409,1512.11,Take it away.,26,,
194,0.97,1512.11,1512.644,Good morning.,27,,
195,0.97,1512.644,1543.942,"Again as has been said by my colleagues, really appreciate your taking the time to be here with us this morning as well as all the work that you are doing both driving an important component of Seattle's economic engine as well as the work you have been doing in collaborating with the city of Seattle on addressing the impacts of the West Seattle bridge closure.",27,,
196,0.97,1543.942,1555.687,"You have been fantastic partner in--that very, very large impact to so many different parts of our region, not just in district 1.",27,,
197,0.97,1555.687,1558.957,So really appreciate that.,27,,
198,0.97,1558.957,1583.682,"Um, as it relates to--the--question around expected rail operations beginning increased rail operations I should say beginning in January 2022, can you let us know whether or not there is likely also to be an increase of truck traffic associated with that particular time frame?",27,,
199,0.97,1583.682,1597.896,"And then under the climate action and Sustainability initiative, wondering--um--can you give us more information about the Timeline around shore power?",27,,
200,0.97,1597.896,1600.465,When will it become available?,27,,
201,0.97,1600.465,1603.802,Finally really very interested in the expanded use of electric trucks.,27,,
202,0.97,1603.802,1617.549,We have done a lot here in Seattle contracting with--large trucks with Waste management and that are electric vehicles.,27,,
203,0.97,1617.549,1619.351,This is an important area to expand into.,27,,
204,0.97,1619.351,1627.826,Just wondering whether or not the port will be investing in electric vehicle for the on dock work.,27,,
205,0.97,1627.826,1630.862,Thank you Council member Hib.,28,,
206,0.97,1630.862,1635.934,Some of these questions were directly operational which I will defer to Ceo Wolfe on.,28,,
207,0.97,1635.934,1639.104,Maybe he could start and I will take it from there.,28,,
208,0.97,1639.104,1650.782,Duo--we do have a project going on right now with electric trucks.,28,,
209,0.97,1650.782,1656.688,We are in direct conversations with--[Indiscernible] who have battery operated.,28,,
210,0.97,1656.688,1662.661,"They are 6,000 pounds more per truck.",28,,
211,0.97,1662.661,1667.265,They just want are also interested in hydrogen.,28,,
212,0.97,1667.265,1671.136,That is something else we are looking at.,28,,
213,0.97,1671.136,1697.228,We--part of it was it would be available upon opening of the dock and I know there was--an--a sense of concern about the--will the ships use the Elek--electrical--[Indiscernible] that number has exceeded significantly mostly driven by China calling on L.A.,28,,
214,0.97,1697.228,1717.916,Where they have to use it ask you realize all of our clean air work is really to keep in front of the requirement because we are still in attainment according to the EPA and so--we want to stay pro active which makes it not required but--just the right thing do.,28,,
215,0.97,1717.916,1723.922,"Ceo Wolfe, do you want to fill in?",28,,
216,0.97,1723.922,1725.156,Yeah.,29,,
217,0.97,1725.156,1726.357,I will be brief.,29,,
218,0.97,1726.357,1735.066,"First on that question about will the opening of T-5 create more truck traffic, short Sans yes.",29,,
219,0.97,1735.066,1746.111,Although we are putting a strong emphasis on bringing vessels that have a heavy use of rail and that has ban priority for both the Seaport alliance and our terminal operator.,29,,
220,0.97,1746.111,1751.216,Some of the cargo will shift from terminal 18 and terminal 30 over to 5.,29,,
221,0.97,1751.216,1758.923,When you see more truck traffic coming in out of 5 assume there is less truck traffic.,29,,
222,0.97,1758.923,1776.708,The other thing we are working with our terminal operator and labor Y partners is working on a great program.,29,,
223,0.97,1776.708,1786.551,We are looking at--how we can fund a more permanent extended gate program where we can work after hours.,29,,
224,0.97,1786.551,1796.461,The advantage is that we are working outside of the heavy traffic during the day and the trucks are more efficient.,29,,
225,0.97,1796.461,1802.3,Can move more swiftly in and out of the terminals which helps operational but also helps the environment.,29,,
226,0.97,1802.3,1807.839,So that has been a project we have been working on.,29,,
227,0.97,1807.839,1809.707,So more to come on that.,29,,
228,0.97,1809.707,1813.845,We are edge sited to get that going.,29,,
229,0.97,1813.845,1819.784,On the short power t short power will be available day one when we open.,29,,
230,0.97,1819.784,1837.135,So we have yet to determine which vessels will shift over to terminal 5 and part of it is looking at those vessels that have that capability because we would like be able to utilize that as soon as we open.,29,,
231,0.97,1837.135,1843.474,The carriers have said that they want to use a shore power when they can.,29,,
232,0.97,1843.474,1844.242,We may Incentivize that.,29,,
233,0.97,1844.242,1854.152,We are talking with our Commission about what that incentive program would look like so we can ensure those vessels are used.,29,,
234,0.97,1854.152,1858.122,So more to come on that.,29,,
235,0.97,1858.122,1861.259,Then your question about notification of trucks.,29,,
236,0.97,1861.259,1875.807,So there is the yard--within the terminal and we are working on trying to get a pilot project with a terminal operator to put some electric trucks into the terminal.,29,,
237,0.97,1875.807,1897.228,"Then on a broader sense what the Commissioner mentioned, we also are working with the trucking industry as that technology advances to get moved in a direction of piloting the trucks as well.",29,,
238,0.97,1897.228,1900.898,We all see movement--[Indiscernible] it is expensive right now.,29,,
239,0.97,1900.898,1907.839,We are hoping that this Federal infrastructure bill will help us support that effort.,29,,
240,0.97,1907.839,1911.809,Can I add a couple of things real quick?,30,,
241,0.97,1911.809,1923.922,The port of Seattle is putting up $2 million to pay for that extending gate operation.,30,,
242,0.97,1923.922,1926.858,This is part of our commitment to being Neighborly.,30,,
243,0.97,1926.858,1943.441,We are looking for additional parking areas for trucks so when they are not operating that they have a place to go and you realize these drivers are mostly independent immigrant operators.,30,,
244,0.97,1943.441,1944.042,It is per container movement.,30,,
245,0.97,1944.042,1945.176,It is good for the neighborhood.,30,,
246,0.97,1945.176,1948.479,It is good for the gate way and for the drivers.,30,,
247,0.97,1948.479,1953.151,We are highly motivated to help facilitate it.,30,,
248,0.97,1953.151,1957.255,"Council member Herbold, any follow up questions?",31,,
249,0.97,1957.255,1959.791,Yes.,32,,
250,0.97,1959.791,1963.795,Thank you so much Council President.,32,,
251,0.97,1963.795,1972.036,It relates to the gap on the establishment of the quiet zone and the reopening of T-5.,32,,
252,0.97,1972.036,1987.385,I am ant--Ith first--first I warrant--I want to say I appreciate you working with the city.,32,,
253,0.97,1987.385,1988.252,That has been challenging work.,32,,
254,0.97,1988.252,2021.853,This was the outcome of comes to parallel efforts I was pursuing the establishment of the quiet zone using a statement of legislative intent as a vehicle to kind of push Sdci to work with the port in the development of the EIS and that is where it is required and you are 100% fulfilling the obligations of the Eeis.,32,,
255,0.97,2021.853,2043.508,It doesn't have to be operational at the same time as the opening and there will be--I'm estimating about a one year gap between the reopening of T-5 and not establishment of the quiet zone but the--Operationalization of the quiet zone.,32,,
256,0.97,2043.508,2059.59,Ãši am just--have--is there anything we can do to--mitigate the impacts on the neighborhood for that one year period of time?,32,,
257,0.97,2059.59,2062.727,"It is a fair question, council member Herbold.",33,,
258,0.97,2062.727,2071.235,You are correct that her schedule--the quiet zone will be fully functional at the opening of phase 2.,33,,
259,0.97,2071.235,2088.886,"Um, let me do this because I--I need to circle back to see if there are specific ways either we can expedite that project more quickly and or work with the railroad to see if there is other ways to mitigate the noise.",33,,
260,0.97,2088.886,2100.264,If it is okay with you--let me circle back with our team and then we will get back to you with the specifics?,33,,
261,0.97,2100.264,2104.001,Thank you so much.,34,,
262,0.97,2104.001,2105.136,I really appreciate it.,34,,
263,0.97,2105.136,2120.618,There is this low frequency system that does not require that same annoying sound so that was one of the things we were able to do.,35,,
264,0.97,2120.618,2131.262,I don't know whether such things are possible on rail or just having conductors Acrosswalks may be something that could help.,35,,
265,0.97,2131.262,2132.83,We will look into it.,35,,
266,0.97,2132.83,2133.097,Great.,36,,
267,0.97,2133.097,2135.166,Thank you so much.,36,,
268,0.97,2135.166,2143.074,"Are there any other comments or questions, colleagues?",36,,
269,0.97,2143.074,2147.078,I'm not seeing any other hands raised.,36,,
270,0.97,2147.078,2159.29,"Anything else you all want to say in closing to us, the members of the viewing public as we continue to work together on this really important overall regional asset?",36,,
271,0.97,2159.29,2167.031,I'd like to just point out one of the things that are near and dear to me where my professional worlds Collide.,37,,
272,0.97,2167.031,2181.112,"S in an effort to reduce some of the impacts--on our marine life and particular our endangered killer waves, we have a program called quiet sound that is about to go in operation.",37,,
273,0.97,2181.112,2193.391,We are working with Maritime operators and the Whale sighting networks to have the vessels reduce their speed about t three nautical miles an hour in the presence of our endangered Whales.,37,,
274,0.97,2193.391,2203.434,This will reduce the noise emanating from the vessels and will enable the Whales who use the sonar to find fewer fish around right now.,37,,
275,0.97,2203.434,2204.769,This also just came to my attention.,37,,
276,0.97,2204.769,2213.945,"The city is part of the fact that in our efforts to restore, it is one of the most significant runs in the entire area.",37,,
277,0.97,2213.945,2218.382,So you will see the resident killer Whales are coming into Pooug as we speak in time.,37,,
278,0.97,2218.382,2220.518,They are the best fishermen in the world.,37,,
279,0.97,2220.518,2250.481,"They are coming here and hanging around Elliot Bay I'm sure in a large part of all the work we have been doing so I hope we all take satisfaction in the fact that--we are make some progress there and we are doing our best to have killers Whales,--killer Whales, communities and--[Indiscernible]",37,,
280,0.97,2250.615,2251.682,Thank you very much.,38,,
281,0.97,2251.682,2257.388,Anything else you all want to share with us before we close out?,38,,
282,0.97,2257.388,2277.208,"On behalf of the Seaport alliance I want to thank the city for the partnership that the ports as I--see around the world, those ports are strongest when they have their strong partnerships.",39,,
283,0.97,2277.208,2282.48,The city of Seattle is a critically important partner for the port of Seattle and the Seaport alliance.,39,,
284,0.97,2282.48,2295.493,"I want a thank you all for your leadership and also for your support, the business and the jobs and the economic activity.",39,,
285,0.97,2295.493,2296.794,Thank you so much.,40,,
286,0.97,2296.794,2298.329,Perfect note to end on there.,40,,

288,0.97,2303.601,2329.76,I appreciate you reaching out and looking for AB opportunity to create this Connectivity and really learned a lot and was reminded about other things I recall hearing about in the past and really look forward to the on going partnership with you all and hopefully we will have an opportunity to have you all back in Council briefing sometime soon to give us more important information about this collective work.,40,,
289,0.97,2329.76,2333.164,Thank you so much for being with thus morning.,40,,
290,0.97,2333.164,2338.803,Appreciate your time and all of your hard work.,40,,
291,0.97,2338.803,2339.837,Happy to do so.,41,,
292,0.97,2339.837,2340.137,Thank you.,41,,
293,0.97,2340.137,2350.748,"We will go ahead and move to our fourth agenda item which is a preview to have day's city council actions, Council and regional committees.",42,,
294,0.97,2350.748,2383.981,"The order for today's report out will be as follows, council member Sawant will be first followed by Council member Strauss, then Herbold, Juarez, Morales, Mosqueda, Pedersen and Council member Lewis asked for a special Dispen stations be able to go last since he had to pop out of Council briefing for a few minutes so we will put him in at the end of the Cue.",42,,
295,0.97,2383.981,2394.225,Without any further Delayly hand it over to Council member Sawant to kick off this section of our agenda.,42,,
296,0.97,2394.225,2394.558,Good morning.,42,,
297,0.97,2394.558,2396.627,Thank you and good morning.,43,,
298,0.97,2396.627,2405.202,There are no items on a today's city council agenda from the committee.,43,,
299,0.97,2405.202,2408.906,"However, there is one item from my office.",43,,
300,0.97,2408.906,2435.766,A bill requested by the--[Indiscernible] this bill originally banned the SPD from Trainings in Israel because they have done in the past learning the tactics.,43,,
301,0.97,2435.766,2458.589,Since then we have expanded the bill to ban the Seattle police Department from training in any country that has a track record of human rights abuses as documented by established and mainstream International human right bodies.,43,,
302,0.97,2458.589,2489.653,On behalf of the activists leading the struggle and bringing two amendments this afternoon to the bill that was--passed out of committee the public safety committee last week with three votes for the bill and the--the two amendments I'm bringing forward are to amend how the bill defines what countries have committed human rights abuses to close loopholes that might have been created been Aamendment.,43,,
303,0.97,2489.653,2500.464,That definition that was passed in the committee I obtained.,43,,
304,0.97,2500.464,2545.242,These amendments preserve a--[Indiscernible] one amendment makes it clear to include in the definition human rights abuses occurring not just within the nation but also within territories--[Indiscernible] there are numerous instances of the military or police forces of a nation abusing the right rights of others outside of the nation's borders.,43,,
305,0.97,2545.242,2556.287,Later this morning we will circulate a very small variation to that published amendment.,43,,
306,0.97,2556.287,2567.064,The second amendment adds a reference to the International criminal code statute which was left out of the amendment that the public safety Committee approved last Tuesday.,43,,
307,0.97,2567.064,2601.198,"The current craft of the legislation that was passed cites two human rights treaties, and--[Indiscernible] the amendment left out the International criminal course statute as another indicator of a government intentions to abide by human rights and international law.",43,,
308,0.97,2601.198,2615.746,Since the exclusion--[Indiscernible] it is only logical to cite it along with the other treaties.,43,,
309,0.97,2615.746,2618.816,That is simply what the amendment does.,43,,
310,0.97,2618.816,2635.733,"For those interested in this level of detail as of 2019, 123 nations are part of the International statute and there for would remain viable training partners unless they feel other criteria in the ordinance.",43,,
311,0.97,2635.733,2642.573,I appreciate the work of Seattle's exchange.,43,,
312,0.97,2642.573,2648.712,They work closely with our office to craft these amendments.,43,,

318,0.97,2696.226,2724.188,Rent in Seattle have risen more than 25% this year alone which means thousands more will become very likely homeless and tens of thousands of other working Seattle--[Indiscernible] will remain housed only at the cost of falling deeper and deeper in debt.,43,,
319,0.97,2724.188,2738.368,"So of the two bills, one is the bill recommended by the city of Seattle's Renter Commission to require six months notice for rent increase.",43,,

326,0.97,2783.113,2817.281,We know 25% rent increases are Unconsciousable and Seattle needs rent control with no corporate loopholes which is why my office alongside Renters rights advocates has prepared rent control legislation that if passed will go into effect the moment state legislators tend 40 year ban on any regulation of rent and if this Council does pass rent control then the Democrats in Lim who are in a majority in both houses and occupy the government will no longer be able to ignore the rent control ban they have maintained in place for decades.,43,,

398,0.97,3325.455,3341.571,The only thing I have not ascertained at this time is whether or not there is an exemption for diplomatic trips and so once USA search thank information if there is an exemption I would not be bringing the amendment.,58,,

404,0.97,3363.827,3372.102,Would it be if--diplomats from these identified countries come here or is it if folks from here go there?,59,,
405,0.97,3372.102,3379.976,Can you just add a little bit more texture?,59,,
406,0.97,3379.976,3390.12,Yes.,60,,

419,0.97,3447.61,3459.088,We did not actually bring any Definitional language forward in committee.,65,,
420,0.97,3459.088,3471.968,I do know that central staff has drafted some language that might be useful for you to consider.,65,,
421,0.97,3471.968,3482.478,I'd be happy to send that on.,65,,
422,0.97,3486.616,3488.017,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",66,,
423,0.97,3488.017,3488.384,Appreciate that.,66,,

426,0.97,3495.725,3496.092,Thank you.,67,,
427,0.97,3496.092,3515.645,In--a response to the Pacific point that Council member Strauss raised--I would be fine with clarifying the language to--to clarify that diplomatic trips--with elected officials would be except and--already informed my staff.,67,,
428,0.97,3515.645,3522.518,My staff Arelinessing on the listen line and they will--reach out to your office if you are okay with it.,67,,
429,0.97,3522.518,3527.023,We are happy to work with you on it.,67,,
430,0.97,3527.023,3543.339,We will also check what central staff have worked up to make sure there is no sort of Repetitiveness or thinking like that.,67,,
431,0.97,3543.339,3549.345,Council member Lewis has raised that--he had questions about training and that needs to be better defined.,67,,
432,0.97,3549.345,3567.697,As I said in the Nitty and now this para phrase what I said in the committee is that--we did not create a narrative and when I say we I mean in consultation with the activists and the legal experts who are leading this effort in the community.,67,,
433,0.97,3567.697,3577.04,We did not create a definition of training because the policy intention is to have the broadest possible interpretation of that word.,67,,
434,0.97,3577.04,3603.232,We don't--because the--point is to not create loopholes and Unfortunately the Council members who have--who have they raised this concern but have not given my office any hypothetical scenario that would be accidentally prohibited by this language.,67,,
435,0.97,3603.232,3609.806,There was a discussion--we have not been able to map out any hypothetical scenario even.,67,,
436,0.97,3609.806,3616.045,We have not had any specific amendment language forthcoming to define it.,67,,
437,0.97,3616.045,3628.992,I would be opened to looking at the language but there isn't such language and we redefined were Dedid not we fine training just like we define hundreds of work.,67,,
438,0.97,3628.992,3635.064,Don't define hundreds of words and other words in the resolution because the actual meaning is the common definition of the word.,67,,
439,0.97,3635.064,3646.676,There's a common definition of the word training and our concern would be the reasonable reason to create a special definition would be to then allow certain types of training by human rights Violators.,67,,
440,0.97,3646.676,3657.086,"If that is the intent, then I would like to see the hypothetical scenarios and more importantly as the bill is coming up for a vote any amendment language.",67,,
441,0.97,3657.086,3658.221,We have seen neither.,67,,
442,0.97,3658.221,3662.992,The example given in committee was SPD getting training in less lethal weapon.,67,,
443,0.97,3662.992,3673.503,I've been making it clear that I do not want the Seattle police to be training in the use of crowd control weapons by human rights Abusers because we have seen the impact of that.,67,,
444,0.97,3673.503,3679.642,We saw that loud and clear during the black lives matter protests last year.,67,,
445,0.97,3679.642,3691.621,My office also Dade quick Scan which shows there are dozens of citations of quote on quote training and training programs that are not accompanied by any legal definition of the word training.,67,,
446,0.97,3691.621,3697.527,Maybe there is some word but we did not spot it.,67,,
447,0.97,3697.527,3715.678,For example--[Indiscernible] the chief of police authorized to establish immediate service of program using personnel with a distinctive uniform to aid regular police officers performing community services associated with law enforcement.,67,,
448,0.97,3715.678,3731.761,Developing potential police officers--there is the word training is used it is not explained.,67,,
449,0.97,3731.761,3737.333,There is no legal definition of training because it is a common word that is commonly understood.,67,,
450,0.97,3737.333,3739.268,That is why would say about that.,67,,
451,0.97,3739.268,3747.744,"If there are any specific thoughts, please let my staff members know.",67,,
452,0.97,3747.744,3748.478,Okay.,68,,

461,0.97,3774.303,3781.344,I did get a note from Council member Mosqueda who is asking for an opportunity to go first.,68,,
462,0.97,3781.344,3786.749,She has a personal commitment at 11:15 she has to travel for.,68,,
463,0.97,3786.749,3795.258,"If there is no objection, would it be okay if Council member Mosqueda gives her report next?",68,,

785,0.97,6398.358,6449.342,"I want to take a moment acknowledge a letter that my office received from Dan Malone at the downtown emergency service center although the letter is on behalf of several service providers who do work in the behavioral mental health let--mental health response and--[Indiscernible] and calling for a summit between city, County and state leaders to discuss the--state of behavioral mental health response in the city of Seattle and things that can be done immediately clarify certain obstacles and deliver essential services to the people who absolutely need them.",106,,
786,0.97,6449.342,6467.227,We need no reminder as we walk around the city of seat that will so many of our neighbors with Unkieg nosed or untreated behavioral mental health conditions are living without the support and access to care that they need to be successful.,106,,
787,0.97,6467.227,6473.333,Many are experiencing long term chronic homelessness as a result.,106,,
788,0.97,6473.333,6478.505,This letter makes three discreet asks to be accomplished at the summit.,106,,
789,0.97,6478.505,6499.993,One is a request for a sophisticated legal analysis of House bill 1310 which as folks will recall was legislation considerably changing the scope of interactions law enforcement can have.,106,,
790,0.97,6499.993,6521.314,There is concern it has Muddled the Interconnectivity that is sometimes required between a law enforcement rests on and providers and just a need to clarify how we as a region interpreting that legislation and to have an honest conversation.,106,,
791,0.97,6521.314,6561.288,The second point which is somewhat related is a clarification of the current policy for the role of law enforcement that has been--[Indiscernible] these procedures have received a variety of conflicting interpretations and information from patrol officers that are interacting with these procedures and indicating different policies at different times.,106,,
792,0.97,6561.288,6580.273,This inconsistency makes it difficult for our provider community do this work and to do their job and they are requesting some clarification on the interpretation and instruction to law enforcement and how to engage with these providers and this needs to be rectified.,106,,
793,0.97,6580.273,6600.894,"Third, the summit should Id and implement necessary law enforcement alternatives to respond to behavioral mental health calls as has been envisioned by this Council, as has been envisioned by leaders and by many of these service providers for years.",106,,
794,0.97,6600.894,6606.9,This has been something the letter identifies that is a priority.,106,,
795,0.97,6606.9,6634.427,They identify that there are several existing services that can take on a bigger load as well as potentially some future services that are envisioned and just urge more of a sense of standing this up quickly to respond to the--crisis that they experienced on the streets everyday.,106,,
796,0.97,6634.427,6659.252,This letter is certainly in line with the urgency that Council member Herbold has expressed through the public safety committee with her leadership on front loading and standing up the resources in our supplemental budget for triage 1 early.,106,,
797,0.97,6659.252,6669.863,I think this is a very necessary summit and I applaud the initiative of these providers in convening this conversation.,106,,
798,0.97,6669.863,6691.117,I think that--I don't think there is any doubt this down shrill be a strong and active participant in pursuing these kinds of solutions and I really look forward to the work that comes out of a summit like this and urge universal participation from other actors in local governments.,106,,
799,0.97,6691.117,6707.801,I do want to give a brief plug for the start program t support team assisted response in Denver.,106,,
800,0.97,6707.801,6714.908,"That program is deployed in a Van with a dual team of a health care Clinician, a mental health Clinician and a Paramedic.",106,,
801,0.97,6714.908,6730.19,It can be deployed by 911 dispatch but also be deployed by a simple phone number which is 720-913-7827.,106,,
802,0.97,6730.19,6735.495,7827 is Star as an abbreviation.,106,,
803,0.97,6735.495,6752.645,As I talk with business owners there is a crying need for a simple number that can be called to get immediate assistance with mental health calls of this nature that these providers are calling for clarification around.,106,,
804,0.97,6752.645,6766.76,I very much like the simplicity of a support team that can be accessed by a phone number that includes the four letter Acronym.,106,,
805,0.97,6766.76,6776.236,The Star program in Denver has been lobbied for intensely by the Denver police Department.,106,,
806,0.97,6776.236,6789.015,I know this will be an ongoing conversation.,106,,
807,0.97,6789.015,6803.73,I know Council member Herbold has done incredible work laying the ground work for this transition and that we just as recently as last week took another affirmative attempt forward on.,106,,
808,0.97,6803.73,6807.934,I just wanted to lift that great work.,106,,
809,0.97,6807.934,6822.815,Finally I have the regional Council this coming Thursday and will be representing us at both the operations committee as well as the executive committee.,106,,
810,0.97,6822.815,6825.985,We will report back on anything next week.,106,,
811,0.97,6825.985,6831.758,With that I have no additional updates.,106,,
812,0.97,6831.758,6833.259,Thank you so much.,107,,
813,0.97,6833.259,6835.428,I do see one hand raised.,107,,
814,0.97,6835.428,6843.77,I will go ahead and call on her.,107,,
815,0.97,6843.77,6849.142,"Just very quickly, bringing to my attention this call.",108,,
816,0.97,6849.142,6868.661,I have seen a lot of the concern and discussion around both the city's response to 1310 as well as--concern around the speed at which we are standing up alternatives.,108,,
817,0.97,6868.661,6871.831,I have not seen this particular call for a summit.,108,,
818,0.97,6871.831,6884.377,I would very much appreciate Council member Lewis if you would send that correspondents my way.,108,,
819,0.97,6884.377,6894.754,Toy want to--lift up--some of the information that we received from SPD when we have asked.,108,,
820,0.97,6894.754,6898.725,I've engaged with chief Diaz numerous times as well a Dr.,108,,
821,0.97,6898.725,6911.904,Fisher around the issue of--the impacts of 1310 on SPD response just a small exert from the chief's statement on the manner.,108,,
822,0.97,6911.904,6928.121,The Cheefr--chief said none of these laws prohibit agencies from responding to calls of service.,108,,
823,0.97,6928.121,6937.13,We know from our data and experience that any use of force is statistically rare.,108,,
824,0.97,6937.13,6952.312,"We will continue to engage--[Indiscernible] we will continue responding to calls for service involving behavioral health or crisis related issues as we Conow to over 10,000 crisis related calls annually.",108,,
825,0.97,6952.312,6991.184,"In each case as with any case officers will assess the situation and act with reasonable care, evaluate available resources, employ De-Escalation tactics with the goal of achieving voluntary compliance and determine--[Indiscernible] and then last week because of some--recently produced data by David of cross cut, that there was a one month reduction in specifically Seattle police Department involuntary commitments.",108,,
826,0.97,6991.184,6998.191,The reduction was about 45% over previous months.,108,,
827,0.97,6998.191,7013.806,The--response I received to SPD specifically to this question was that in light of 1310 it is logical officers are being more critical of when to engage a situation where force might get used to effect in voluntary commitment.,108,,
828,0.97,7013.806,7029.422,"It does appear in these types of incidents they are in--it doesn't say they are not responding, it says they rent gaming in dialogue offering services, et cetera.",108,,
829,0.97,7029.422,7037.764,"If there is no clear threat to life, they are not proceeding to engage physically.",108,,
830,0.97,7037.764,7045.805,1310 specifically addresses the issue as--using the authority in state law.,108,,
831,0.97,7045.805,7048.808,This is me speaking now.,108,,
832,0.97,7048.808,7057.683,1310 specifically addresses the issue of using involuntary commitments and authorizes use of force.,108,,
833,0.97,7057.683,7074.333,Again the--the--the legal standard is that somebody is--has a--imminent threat to--life to one self or to another.,108,,
834,0.97,7074.333,7100.593,And so what I understand what SPD is saying is--they are making a--an effort to really apply that imminent threat standard before engaging in any any physical force that might be necessary to affect an involuntary transfer.,108,,
835,0.97,7100.593,7150.676,"But this aside, I appreciate hearing more about the--on the street--on the ground experiences of our human services procedures when they are seeking the assistance of SPD and having these engagements in totally agree and--aligned with the desire to get clarity on what the intended impact is of the state law and what the--the outcomes are for--mental health engagements that could result or are resulting today from--from that intended impact.",108,,
836,0.97,7150.676,7151.511,Thank you.,108,,
837,0.97,7151.511,7154.747,"Thank you so much, council member Herbold.",109,,
