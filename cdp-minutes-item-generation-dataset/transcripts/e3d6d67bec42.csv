577,0.97,9481.438,9487.177,"As you all know, there was tragic shooting that took place on November 8th that resulted in the loss of the student.",283,,
578,0.97,9487.177,9532.089,"Just by the sheer number of students at yesterday's rally, it's obvious the impact this left on all of us in the Seattle school district . It's obvious the momentum there is behind this movement . There were so many factors that led up to this shooting, but the most important is the mental health epidemic we are seeing in schools . The bottom line is, we need money to hire the therapists that our students need . I urge the city Council to move money from the graffiti removal fund into kids mental health support in order to prevent this from becoming the reality us students have to live with . your decision on this will truly show us whether you care more about buildings in the city or the children of the city . Thank you.",283,,

584,0.97,9581.138,9601.158,There is not enough proper mental health support for children in schools . We cannot hope to prevent tragedies like the shooting that occurred on Tuesday morning at Ingram high school if we do not address this fact . This proposal will allow this districts to hire licensed mental health therapists that can help students work through issues that they are not equipped to deal with on their own.,285,,
585,0.97,9601.158,9614.104,Children should not be expected to solve problems that they do not have the tools to solve . We as students and children cannot be in the situation that we are in . Thank you.,285,,

I encourage all of the city Council to move money from graffiti removal, which is property, into kids mental health support .

My counselors should not feel the burden of mental health when their job is to provide guidance to graduates.",287,,
589,0.97,9672.963,9699.69,"I should have access to a licensed therapist in school Spchlt not only that, there needs to be enough therapists in school to Sustainably support us all . With proper mental health support we hope to prevent Trablg DIS like what occurred last Tuesday at Ingram high school and what continues to occur across our nation due to gun violence . It's clear to me that if this request is not met, the city council values property over the lives of the children that they represent.",287,,

I encourage all our city Council to move money from graffiti, which is property, into kids mental health support . students and I across the District should be able to access licensed therapists . It's especially important that these therapists reflect the diversity of the student body in each Seattle school with more mental health support from these licensed therapists, it can help to prevent incidents like the one we experienced last Tuesday, November 8th, at Ingram high school . This money from the graffiti removal into mental health support is an important need because some don't have access to support in their homes, and not everyone is privileged enough to have role models to look up to that can teach them how to manage conflicts . So please listen to us and choose kids over property, thank you.",291,,

I am a college educated and I'm a published author . and if you walk the streets out here, you'd see that we actually aren't homeless, we have homes . They may not be brick and mortar, but they're our homes nonetheless . and when you sweep us, all it does is creates a larger rift between us and Marginalizes us so that we are hated and despised and creating bigger problems that you may not even see . But the ones of us that actually have gotten homes have turned their lives around and gotten jobs, they're clean and doing what they can to stay off the street . If we actually had the opportunity and get half a chance, maybe my dead friends and brothers and sisters that have died out here every day maybe would have had a chance.",299,,

I've learned that--anyone in the area to blanket stop and Frisk, so really all that shot Spotter does is increase opportunities for police violence and brutality and permanently Embed surveillance in neighborhoods for profit . The Council cannot approve the Mayor's proposal to snatch $86 million from the jump start budget and funnel $20 million to SPD and $38 million to violent Sweeps .

683,0.97,11158.38,11238.427,"There was two issues raised for us that I was not aware of . It does look like the Mayor's proposed budget did include a reduction in Gender-Based violence in his proposed budget . and in chatting with central staff, and I'm looking at the public safety chair, I know we're going to follow up on this, I'm sure, but it's our understanding that that was actually a program that was put on hold with his desire to put $20 million of mostly budget priorities on hold . There was a reduction in this year's proposed budget . I think because of that reduction, Aligning with funding that hadn't been previously allocated, it wasn't on my radar as being a reduction . So there was no cut made in our proposed budget, but we may want to consider how we address that proposed reduction to previous allocations from the Council . So thanks for flagging that . I really want to thank as well the youth who testified today, especially giving us some good ideas for where to continue to look for additional funding for mental health services . and I didn't say this yesterday, and I'm going to go back to our vice chair, I should have said yesterday that the base 500,000, the half a million dollars that the vice chair had asked for for mental health in schools, that was submitted before the shooting.",347,,
684,0.97,11238.427,11302.824,"So thanks to her good work, we had the Cva to put in immediately . We were planning to put it in already, but in the last 24 hours before the budget was finalized we were able to add that million that I mentioned yesterday . So I wanted to make sure to thank the vice chair for her good work to put that amendment forward . and we were just able to build on that, adding $1.5 million each year, so thank you Councilmember Herbold for that initial amendment . and looking forward to continuing to work with all of you and the community to build on that and so many other items that were mentioned today . So thanks to everybody who Dialled in, to our colleagues who are still here with us, really appreciate you listening in throughout the last three hours and 15 minutes . and with that, if there's no other business for the order--for the good of the order, we will be adjourned, and we will reconvene on November 21st, 9:30 a.m. amendments due tomorrow at noon .
