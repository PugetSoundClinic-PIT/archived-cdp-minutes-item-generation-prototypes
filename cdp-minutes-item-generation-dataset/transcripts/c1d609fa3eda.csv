26,0.97,213.846,214.714,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",7,,
27,0.97,214.714,218.484,I just have a question.,8,,
28,0.97,218.484,227.427,I was so excited about it when it was proposed.,8,,
29,0.97,227.427,229.028,And I had no idea that there was a move afoot to close City Hall shelter.,8,,
30,0.97,229.028,229.629,What is the status of that?,8,,
31,0.97,229.629,230.63,Is not included in one of these?,8,,
32,0.97,230.63,234.634,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,9,,
33,0.97,234.634,249.916,The short answer to your question is that the item is not included here but it is on the lines to provide additional information about what is still allowed and going to be funded at City Hall.,9,,
34,0.97,249.916,256.889,A little bit of a halfway their policy answer to the forum that was proposed.,9,,
35,0.97,256.889,265.598,"So just take it Away., Jeff.",9,,
36,0.97,265.598,268.868,That is right Madam chair.,10,,
37,0.97,268.868,277.61,The salvation Army currently operates the city hall shelters and the intentions that they will be moving the operations to a location in Sodo and it might be underway at this point.,10,,
38,0.97,277.61,283.716,"By moving all of those beds, they will become enhanced shelter beds rather than just basic overnight beds.",10,,
39,0.97,283.716,297.13,So that is where the current provider will be moving to as well as maintaining the beds and the location that is currently utilized will be used as a storm shelter.,10,,
40,0.97,297.13,308.007,"If you recall the last couple of years, we have had extreme weather situations or smoke recently and there have been expansions in places like Bishop pavilion.",10,,
41,0.97,308.007,318.151,The plan is to utilize the city hall space for those purposes over the next year and not continue utilizing it as an overnight only basic shelter kind of a location.,10,,
42,0.97,318.151,319.852,Thank you.,11,,
43,0.97,319.852,325.958,I appreciate that understanding and explanation.,11,,
44,0.97,325.958,337.303,We have a 20 year history of providing shelter at this location and not just for winter response.,11,,
45,0.97,337.303,356.422,I just want to signal my interest in maybe next year with funds as they might become available to encourage the executive to continue contracting with the provider for what I think is an important service.,11,,
46,0.97,356.422,367.7,"I recognize that it is not enhanced shelter and that is the gold standard, if you will, for shelter.",11,,
47,0.97,367.7,378.711,But I think there is still a role for this in the continuum of emergency services.,11,,
48,0.97,378.711,379.011,Thank you.,11,,
49,0.97,379.011,382.915,Thank you very much Councilmember Herbold.,12,,
50,0.97,382.915,393.826,The other half we measure was wanting to make sure that there was insufficient Janitorial support in case there was ever the need to do emergency shelter as Jeff mentioned.,12,,
51,0.97,393.826,405.738,And confirming that we are maintaining additional Janitorial support in case the city hall structure is needed to be used for emergency shelters of any kind.,12,,
52,0.97,405.738,406.205,I agree with you.,12,,
53,0.97,406.205,406.839,We should be offering shelter.,12,,
54,0.97,406.839,424.657,"It should be additive to whatever is offered in Sodo especially since late--spaces so limited downtown Seattle and we have quite a lot of space in that building right now, both in the main floor and downstairs were the shelter used to be, given the ongoing need.",12,,
55,0.97,424.657,426.759,I think it is important for us to continue that commitment.,12,,
56,0.97,426.759,434.7,"Given Covid-19, I think the question is, how do we also make it so that it's a safe place to be.",12,,
57,0.97,434.7,438.437,"But the commitment to making sure it is a shelter in future years, I agree with you.",12,,
58,0.97,438.437,446.379,"Any other items folks would like to lift up in this section here? thank you, colleagues for all of your homework.",12,,
59,0.97,446.379,454.987,Three tiny House villages . not just a proviso but fully funded in this effort.,12,,
60,0.97,454.987,456.055,One specifically in Councilmember Pedersen.,12,,
61,0.97,456.055,465.031,Thank you for your support and two additional around the city.,12,,
62,0.97,465.031,473.94,This is about twice the amount of investments we made from the tiny House villages last year.,12,,
63,0.97,473.94,474.707,And I see Councilmember Morales.,12,,
64,0.97,474.707,475.107,Please go ahead.,12,,
65,0.97,475.107,475.575,"Yes, thank you.",13,,
66,0.97,475.575,485.084,I just wanted to express my deep appreciation for having this.,13,,
67,0.97,485.084,488.654,It would be great if we could have more access to tiny home villages and to other shelters.,13,,
68,0.97,488.654,518.317,"I actually just got notice from an outreach worker in the Georgetown neighborhood who was just engaging with somebody who was living in their car and basically, what she says is that SPD watched her engage and then came in and made the person get out of their car and then impounded the car.",13,,
69,0.97,518.317,521.621,And so Obviusly we will be following up on this to see what is going on.,13,,
70,0.97,521.621,537.67,She can't find a place for this individual to go now and is now looking for a tent to help this person pitch somewhere because there car has been removed and taken from them.,13,,
71,0.97,537.67,559.091,"So especially as we are entering a cold and wet winter, we need to be really deliberate about how we provide better services for our homeless neighbors and that we are tracking very carefully what kind of engagement and contact is happening with our homeless neighbors so that their rights are protected as well.",13,,
72,0.97,559.091,567.9,So I just wanted to share that I literally just got notice that this is happening in Georgetown right now.,13,,
73,0.97,567.9,574.44,Thank you Councilmember Mosqueda.,14,,
74,0.97,574.44,578.678,We appreciate you following up on that.,14,,
75,0.97,578.678,578.911,Okay.,14,,
76,0.97,578.911,585.685,I think we can go ahead and move on.,14,,
77,0.97,585.685,609.642,"These investments, a combination of this investment is part of how we make sure that people are on the path to greater stability and making sure that they have the housing or shelter that they need in order to weather this Covid-19 crisis but we also have to have an output out of shelters and temporary housing and that gets us into our next category.",14,,
78,0.97,609.642,623.556,"The next category, items 87 through 92 on the agenda which include $1.1 million of investment related to Renter protections.",15,,
79,0.97,623.556,634.634,"This includes item 87 which would add $34,000 to fully fund a landlord liaison program and imposes a proviso sponsored by Councilmember Herbold.",15,,

83,0.97,674.073,693.259,"Item 91 is also a statement of legislative intent requesting a report from Sdci on standard residential lease terms sponsored by Councilmember Sawant and the final item in this category, item 92, adds $460,000 to Sdci for Eviction legal defense services.",15,,

87,0.97,700.533,701.667,Does anyone want to speak to any item on this category?,16,,
88,0.97,701.667,709.341,Okay.,17,,
89,0.97,709.341,733.866,"I will note that I believe in the Eviction defense legal assistance, we are doubling the investment that we made previous because we recognize as one of the speakers noted in public comment the potential cliff coming for Renters when Eviction prevention moratoriums, if they go away, is going to be massive.",17,,
90,0.97,733.866,739.305,Especially if the Unappointed rate stays as high as they are and the Renters have a backlog of rent they are not able to pay.,17,,
91,0.97,739.305,745.845,We want to make sure the folks renting have support and that this is essentially the program.,17,,
92,0.97,745.845,751.617,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",17,,
93,0.97,751.617,753.619,I want to say I appreciate the support for the landlord liaison program.,18,,
94,0.97,753.619,754.52,It is a small but important investment.,18,,
95,0.97,754.52,764.196,"This program is just incredible, the number of private landlords they are working with and the number of households they have been able to house.",18,,
96,0.97,764.196,765.731,Safeway house with very few Evictions.,18,,
97,0.97,765.731,777.643,"Even though another prime sponsor for the Eviction outreach education and organizing, really want to thank--I don't have it in front of me but I think it is Councilmember Sawant that is the lead on this.",18,,
98,0.97,777.643,804.003,I really appreciate her Championing this as we saw in a recent article today or yesterday from public--there are Evictions happening now despite the city and state moratorium on Evictions and making sure tenants know their rights is really key to avoiding these Evictions because they don't always have been in court.,18,,
99,0.97,804.003,809.542,Sometimes they just happened because the landlord is telling a tenant that they have to go when they don't.,18,,
100,0.97,809.542,814.813,Thank you very much Councilmember Herbold.,19,,
101,0.97,814.813,819.718,I am seeing no additional comments or questions on this.,19,,
102,0.97,819.718,823.255,I think we can go ahead and move on to the next category.,19,,

118,0.97,970.302,971.837,I think I failed to say that.,21,,

125,0.97,998.764,1008.34,I know the Council members that sponsor these are not speaking up so let me Chime in quickly on these first two bullets.,23,,
126,0.97,1008.34,1031.397,I don't want to--I just want to underscore the importance of these historic investments . We are very appreciative of the office of housing and the executive's comments and research that they are able to fully fund the efforts to make sure that this is funded.,23,,
127,0.97,1031.397,1031.764,I'm sorry.,23,,

141,0.97,1098.73,1114.313,"This is the category that includes investments--excuse me, proposals in the package that are resources to fund all the new spending in the balancing package.",24,,
142,0.97,1114.313,1118.65,And so I will just NOTE here that these are Stand-Alone actions necessary to support the proposed spending.,24,,

149,0.97,1161.46,1190.155,"I'm going to spend a little bit more time on this one than the other proposals because amending the 3RD quarter supplemental, there are a number of proposals included here to provide resources or to make sure money that will be spent in 2020 is carried forward into the 2021 budget and because they are not each individual actions, I just want to describe in a little more detail what is included.",25,,
150,0.97,1190.155,1191.356,If you can for a moment go to the next slide please.,25,,

153,0.97,1205.737,1213.946,I LSO want to highlight a few additional more substantive changes that are proposed.,26,,
154,0.97,1213.946,1221.086,It is cutting $1.4 million originally appropriated to fund the community health engagement location.,26,,
155,0.97,1221.086,1224.957,This is used to fund three items that we spoke to previously.,26,,

159,0.97,1250.649,1259.591,It costs $1.7 million from the Seattle police Department's 2020 salary savings due to greater than expected 2020 attrition.,26,,

161,0.97,1264.029,1267.065,Next slide please.,26,,
162,0.97,1267.065,1273.605,It also cuts $10 million from Hsd and puts it back in 2021.,26,,
163,0.97,1273.605,1277.943,This is for the community led public safety investments which were described earlier.,26,,
164,0.97,1277.943,1316.281,It also swaps $6.3 million between the transportation Fund and the capital fund to address the anticipated 2020 commercial parking tax shortfall as well as swapping $3 million between the revenue stabilization Fund and general fund to support the Participatory budgeting and community led research work but is using general fund instead of the revenue stabilization fund to maintain at least a 69-Dollar balance in that fund.,26,,
165,0.97,1316.281,1326.958,And then it adds about $1 million to address the anticipated revenue shortfall for the short term rental fund that supports the city's development initiative.,26,,
166,0.97,1326.958,1336.168,So I just wanted to highlight those actions within that one budget amendment.,26,,
167,0.97,1336.168,1339.337,"So if you could go back two slides, Patty.",26,,
168,0.97,1339.337,1339.638,Thank you.,26,,
169,0.97,1339.638,1361.293,"The next item on the agenda is item 102 A. this eliminates the funding for the Department of neighborhoods . item 103 cuts $500,000 Sbt from the Department of neighborhoods that the chair spoke to previously.",26,,
170,0.97,1361.293,1368.9,Item 104 recognizes the city budget office's November 2020 forecast update.,26,,
171,0.97,1368.9,1376.475,Item 105 cuts $2 million from the human services Department for the joint community safety interdepartmental team recommendations.,26,,
172,0.97,1376.475,1380.112,This was included in the budget somewhat in error.,26,,
173,0.97,1380.112,1394.493,It was part of the potential replacement bill before the Council acted on the 2020 budget revision ordinance and overturned the veto.,26,,
174,0.97,1394.493,1398.93,So this is being used to fund other counsel priorities.,26,,
175,0.97,1398.93,1410.809,"Item 106 which cut $164,000 from the office of economic development for the funding for the creative industry policy advisor position.",26,,
176,0.97,1410.809,1417.749,"Item 107 proposes a proviso on $200,000 of General Fund and the police Department for 2020 recruit signing bonuses.",26,,
177,0.97,1417.749,1423.955,This funding was cut in the budget revision ordinance and adopted this fall when you voted to overturn the veto.,26,,
178,0.97,1423.955,1433.632,That funding is needed to pay the second half of the recruit signing bonuses who are already hired.,26,,
179,0.97,1433.632,1445.177,"However instead of cutting money back, it is imposing a proviso on 2021 funds for that purpose.",26,,
180,0.97,1445.177,1460.892,"And then the final item would cut $50,000 in funding from the parks Department for the feasibility study.",26,,
181,0.97,1460.892,1461.526,Thank you Councilmembers.,27,,
182,0.97,1461.526,1470.235,"Colleagues, I want to note that Councilmember Pedersen has been a strong champion of the Magnuson park pool feasibility study.",27,,
183,0.97,1470.235,1475.507,Thank you for your work on that and really concerns you raised about the potential that going away.,27,,
184,0.97,1475.507,1477.375,Happy to have central staff talk a little bit more about those concerns.,27,,
185,0.97,1477.375,1511.109,"There were some initial concerns about the funds . After further consultation with the central staff team here, I would like to consider moving this reduction from the proposed back this year with the understanding that I wanted double check with central staff that that means that the Ceo will be able to work out a swap for something else within the budget so that we can make sure that it is used for something and general funds for the feasibility study.",27,,
186,0.97,1511.109,1522.153,Is that an accurate summary of the desire both Councilmember Pedersen and then I will turn to see if that is correct.,27,,
187,0.97,1522.153,1522.454,Yes.,28,,
188,0.97,1522.454,1523.088,Magnuson Park is very special.,28,,
189,0.97,1523.088,1527.459,Most people think of it as a regional asset for parks.,28,,
190,0.97,1527.459,1533.899,But it is also home to 850 residents.,28,,
191,0.97,1533.899,1536.568,100% or low income.,28,,
192,0.97,1536.568,1540.939,70% identify as bi.,28,,
193,0.97,1540.939,1557.355,What I have been told by central staff is that there was initially a question about the source of funds . With central staff should be able to structure a technical swap of funding sources so that we can preserve this item for Magnuson park.,28,,
194,0.97,1557.355,1567.032,Thank you for drawing our attention to this given the Latebreaking news about the potential for Cvo and parks to be able to figure out a swap.,29,,
195,0.97,1567.032,1574.139,Is there any concern about pulling this out from the package today?,29,,
196,0.97,1574.139,1585.216,"Chair Mosqueda, you had just over $50,000 of Unprogrammed--still left--and we reconcile all the actions.",30,,
197,0.97,1585.216,1603.935,"So we are moving this and shouldn't Append the balancing and my understanding is that with both of you and Councilmember Pedersen, parks will figure out the technical ways to make sure there is available for this purpose and it is used for an eligible purpose.",30,,
198,0.97,1603.935,1608.106,Thank you very much.,31,,
199,0.97,1608.106,1608.64,Councilmember Pedersen.,31,,
200,0.97,1608.64,1615.78,Are there any additional comments on this?,31,,
201,0.97,1615.78,1620.552,Any additional comments on the overall effort here?,32,,
202,0.97,1620.552,1621.052,Councilmember Strauss.,32,,
203,0.97,1621.052,1643.908,I spoke to the third bullet item and we will continue to work with our cap friends and figure out some eloquent solutions between now and Thursday and may be round out the discussion a little bit more and the understanding of what we are trying to publish here.,32,,
204,0.97,1643.908,1645.61,Are there any other items here?,32,,
205,0.97,1645.61,1664.796,We just have the final category which are items 109 through 141 on the agenda which sound like a lot of items but it reflects the majority of the legislation necessary to adopt the budget.,33,,
206,0.97,1664.796,1671.87,All of this budget legislation was summarized in the miscellaneous and and issue a dedication paper that was issued October 16th.,33,,
207,0.97,1671.87,1672.771,And it is listed here with a reference.,33,,
208,0.97,1672.771,1687.585,"But this is really a package of legislation that is necessary to implement the proposed budget, the action and the changes through the balancing package.",33,,
209,0.97,1687.585,1690.221,There will be a few additional pieces.,33,,
210,0.97,1690.221,1704.002,"But for the sake of time, I wasn't intending to read all of these through as all of your amendments would be reflected in the package of legislation that will ultimately get acted on to implement and adopt.",33,,
211,0.97,1704.002,1704.302,Okay.,34,,
212,0.97,1704.302,1711.843,Thank you very much.,34,,
213,0.97,1711.843,1715.146,"Councilmembers, is there anything else that you would like to speak about here today?",34,,
214,0.97,1715.146,1724.489,Okay.,35,,
215,0.97,1724.489,1725.423,I'm not seeing any hands.,35,,
216,0.97,1725.423,1729.26,Let's just give a quick round of applause for our staff for all of this incredible work.,35,,
217,0.97,1729.26,1774.072,"If you were in person, we would all get a chance to see you and standing for the incredible efforts you have put into not only making sure that we have Rebalanced the emergency reserves but that the vast majority of Councilmember's priorities, vast majority were included in this package and that we made substantial investments into the here and now for immediate investments predominantly serving the communities and small businesses and the most vulnerable residents and we are planning for future efforts through community led strategies like the Participatory budgeting process and maintaining funding for the task force initial asks.",35,,
218,0.97,1774.072,1775.006,You have done hero's work.,35,,
219,0.97,1775.006,1784.115,"Central staff, this has been an honor to work with you and to see all the sausage making Behind-The-Scenes.",35,,
220,0.97,1784.115,1786.718,It is a very well received budget project.,35,,
221,0.97,1786.718,1791.222,I know there is a lot to be discussed potentially over the next few days.,35,,
222,0.97,1791.222,1796.294,But a great framework you have established for us and I want to thank our Council colleagues for all of your work.,35,,
223,0.97,1796.294,1797.762,This is truly a reflection of all of your efforts.,35,,
224,0.97,1797.762,1823.922,We put a nice little summary Video on our social media today just highlighting some of the incredible efforts moving forward and the work specifically on creating this Video graphic that shows just a few of these 150 efforts that you all have worked on addressing over the course of the last two months.,35,,
225,0.97,1823.922,1824.889,So thank you and thank you to central staff.,35,,
226,0.97,1824.889,1836.167,I think we will transition to the next item.,35,,
227,0.97,1836.167,1841.806,"Madame Clark, do you mind reading into the record the next item on the agenda?",36,,
228,0.97,1841.806,1849.18,The next item on the agenda is item of business.,37,,
229,0.97,1849.18,1852.784,Number 142 revenue forecast update.,37,,
230,0.97,1852.784,1853.318,Thank you very much.,38,,
231,0.97,1853.318,1858.456,I want to welcome the folks from the city's budget office.,38,,
232,0.97,1858.456,1869.0,I know that you have been listening in to our deliberations today and appreciate all of the revenue forecast information.,38,,
233,0.97,1869.0,1872.003,We are Scoping this presentation to just the revenue forecast information.,38,,
234,0.97,1872.003,1873.238,We know there is overlap with the executive's office.,38,,
235,0.97,1873.238,1882.58,We have already discussed some of the messages we have received from the executive on the proposed budget here.,38,,
236,0.97,1882.58,1889.42,But today's presentation is specific to the revenue forecast so that we can ask questions and reveal back the information in front of us.,38,,
237,0.97,1889.42,1893.925,We appreciate all of your work.,38,,
238,0.97,1893.925,1896.127,"And director, I see you up there.",38,,
239,0.97,1896.127,1897.128,Thank you for your work the last year.,38,,
240,0.97,1897.128,1902.2,We noted at the beginning of the meeting it was a long year.,38,,
241,0.97,1902.2,1905.803,Thank you for your work on this presentation here as well.,38,,
242,0.97,1905.803,1907.939,Thank you.,39,,
243,0.97,1907.939,1915.113,A brief introduction and I will turn it over to Dave Dennis in the revenue forecast team to walk you through more of the details.,39,,
244,0.97,1915.113,1924.255,"Consistent with our overall approach year-to-year, we do an in-depth forecast in April and another revenue forecast in August.",39,,
245,0.97,1924.255,1931.796,"And we provide you an update here in late October, 1ST of November.",39,,
246,0.97,1931.796,1936.801,We sent you a memo about a week ago giving you the underlying financials of the update.,39,,
247,0.97,1936.801,1943.608,The goal today was to give you more of the background about what was driving the change in the revenue forecast which was a notable increase.,39,,
248,0.97,1943.608,1950.548,Also to highlight some of the risks that remain.,39,,
249,0.97,1950.548,1951.683,That is the purpose of the presentation.,39,,
250,0.97,1951.683,1959.991,"With that, I will turn this over to Dave.",39,,
251,0.97,1959.991,1960.458,And walk you through.,39,,
252,0.97,1960.458,1962.026,Can you hear me?,40,,
253,0.97,1962.026,1962.493,We can hear you.,41,,
254,0.97,1962.493,1962.961,Thank you very much.,41,,
255,0.97,1962.961,1965.663,We cannot see you.,41,,
256,0.97,1965.663,1967.598,We can hear you well.,41,,
257,0.97,1967.598,1978.109,We go to the first lied.,42,,
258,0.97,1982.08,1988.987,"As Ben said, we are watching a number of things and also looking ahead.",42,,
259,0.97,1988.987,1994.025,The plan before you was the end of September which was the basis of the proposed budget.,42,,
260,0.97,1994.025,1999.53,The Mayor's proposed budget that you are now working through.,42,,
261,0.97,1999.53,2002.233,This forecast is based on data through the 3RD quarter.,42,,
262,0.97,2002.233,2003.334,And that is important for a couple of reasons.,42,,
263,0.97,2003.334,2008.806,"Number one in the very first slide, what we are seeing now is a rise in Covid-19 cases in King County.",42,,
264,0.97,2008.806,2015.413,The chart you are seeing here is a measure of test Positivity.,42,,
265,0.97,2015.413,2018.783,"Of those that take the test, how many are positive?",42,,
266,0.97,2018.783,2026.491,"As you can see on the right-hand side of the chart, there is a significant increase in the last month, six weeks or so.",42,,
267,0.97,2026.491,2036.968,And interesting about this is that the net forecast we base our regional forecast on didn't really capture this increase.,42,,
268,0.97,2036.968,2040.772,It was done before that.,42,,
269,0.97,2040.772,2047.245,We were watching this closely and that affected what we did in terms of what we are presenting to you today.,42,,
270,0.97,2047.245,2063.394,"As you can see from the bullets, the test Positivity rate has more than doubled in the last month or so too .7% positive.",42,,
271,0.97,2063.394,2077.008,"And this is important as King County remains in phase 2. but I suppose not inconceivable that the--if this were to continue, might move backwards along the reopening plan.",42,,
272,0.97,2077.008,2080.978,And so we will be watching that closely.,42,,
273,0.97,2080.978,2082.447,It also points out how unique this particular situation is.,42,,
274,0.97,2082.447,2087.151,If we go to the slide.,42,,
275,0.97,2087.151,2093.624,We showed you this.,42,,
276,0.97,2093.624,2100.798,"The red line on the left-hand side of the chart, you can see the drop off.",42,,
277,0.97,2100.798,2103.634,And the increase all in the first year of the most recent situation.,42,,
278,0.97,2103.634,2108.206,The most recent recession.,42,,
279,0.97,2108.206,2123.821,It is a typical relative to previous recessions where it was a gradual dissent and to and rise out of the period in terms of what this chart is showing.,42,,
280,0.97,2123.821,2128.025,"I think with our new forecast, we are expecting a faster recovery.",42,,
281,0.97,2128.025,2135.299,But we don't quite know where the Red line is going at this point which is our concern.,42,,
282,0.97,2135.299,2147.778,You see it starting to turn to the right and flattening and the job recovery has not been--it has been slowing.,42,,
283,0.97,2147.778,2148.079,Next slide.,42,,
284,0.97,2148.079,2152.517,This is another view of the uniqueness of this procession and our situation.,43,,
285,0.97,2152.517,2165.997,What this chart is showing is that the action is affecting different sectors of the economy.,43,,
286,0.97,2165.997,2176.641,"The total environment which is the top line of this and if we look at the blue dots, you can see that currently they are at a minus six, minus 7%.",43,,
287,0.97,2176.641,2183.981,That is total employment for the Seattle Msaa.,43,,
288,0.97,2183.981,2184.849,And then you can see the other areas.,43,,
289,0.97,2184.849,2185.716,"Construction, manufacturing and trade.",43,,
290,0.97,2185.716,2188.452,Many of these were further to the left.,43,,
291,0.97,2188.452,2190.988,More negative the last time.,43,,
292,0.97,2190.988,2195.86,That was through July.,43,,
293,0.97,2195.86,2202.7,We are showing you that some of the dots to the right--and construction has recovered a little more.,43,,
294,0.97,2202.7,2206.971,Retail trade is at zero.,43,,
295,0.97,2206.971,2207.305,And growth.,43,,
296,0.97,2207.305,2216.447,"But as you can see, some of them have actually gotten worse since September.",43,,
297,0.97,2216.447,2235.166,"And leisure and hospitality, although it has improved to about minus 26%, it is still not--these are limited by how the economy can respond to this virus.",43,,
298,0.97,2235.166,2238.903,How we as a society can respond to the virus and what will open and what will not.,43,,
299,0.97,2238.903,2239.737,So we continue to watch this closely.,43,,
300,0.97,2239.737,2246.944,The right-hand side of the chart is employment share.,43,,
301,0.97,2246.944,2255.086,"In some respects, we have a very large drop off with unemployment and they represent about 10% of the economy of laborers.",43,,
302,0.97,2255.086,2275.64,"So you can start to see the relative effects of this change . next slide . When we make our forecast, as we said, we begin with the National forecast.",43,,
303,0.97,2275.64,2284.849,And they do the forecast and we take that and we converted . We then use that to make the revenue forecast.,43,,
304,0.97,2284.849,2293.991,"And so what this is showing is essentially that since the last, we have had significant change in various measures.",43,,
305,0.97,2293.991,2299.764,And what we are showing here as the end of limit rate and personal outlay.,43,,
306,0.97,2299.764,2313.077,"The on employment rate has dropped significantly as you can see from 11.7%, which was the basis of the proposed budget, down to 8.8% for quarter three and quarter four.",43,,
307,0.97,2313.077,2315.079,Dropped down to about the same.,43,,
308,0.97,2315.079,2315.279,8.3.,43,,
309,0.97,2315.279,2320.017,So we are experiencing future growth.,43,,
310,0.97,2320.017,2322.887,And we don't know if we will taper out going in.,43,,
311,0.97,2322.887,2335.166,Personal outlay on the Right- hand side of the chart is important because you can see 95%.,43,,
312,0.97,2335.166,2335.9,So 5% below what we expect.,43,,
313,0.97,2335.9,2337.768,I'm sorry to interrupt you.,44,,
314,0.97,2337.768,2340.204,There is a bit of a Glitch in your Audio.,44,,
315,0.97,2340.204,2340.671,I want to make sure.,44,,
316,0.97,2340.671,2351.082,Kinfolks hear Dave okay?,44,,
317,0.97,2352.049,2353.551,There is.,45,,
318,0.97,2353.551,2356.987,What you drop to Video and see if that improves Audio.,46,,
319,0.97,2356.987,2358.656,"Thank you, Dave for making yourself available.",47,,
320,0.97,2358.656,2364.061,Sometimes it is helpful to be able to read lips if there is a Glitch but this is sometimes a great solution.,47,,
321,0.97,2364.061,2373.904,Thank you for letting me interrupt you.,47,,
322,0.97,2373.904,2383.581,Sorry we cannot hear very well.,48,,
323,0.97,2383.581,2393.624,"Anyway, the bottom line here is that we are seeing improvement.",49,,
324,0.97,2393.624,2406.27,A 5% below what we would have been before or we we were in 2019Q4 and that is up from previous proposed budget.,49,,
325,0.97,2406.27,2406.904,The outlay is important.,49,,
326,0.97,2406.904,2409.64,That is expenditure.,49,,
327,0.97,2409.64,2413.21,And so this is having money in their pocket.,49,,
328,0.97,2413.21,2425.856,"That is what is driving that which as we say, significantly improves the outlook for the second half of 2020 and carries forward into 2021.",49,,
329,0.97,2425.856,2428.492,The next slide.,49,,
330,0.97,2428.492,2436.2,Pictures.,50,,
331,0.97,2436.2,2437.234,The same unemployment rate and personal outlay.,50,,
332,0.97,2437.234,2450.214,What this does is shows the difference in a more visual display of how much it has moved up from the proposed budget based forecast to what we are showing you in the current update.,50,,
333,0.97,2450.214,2472.97,"One of the important things to recognize here is that unlike our July 2020 forecast, in October, this includes a 300-Dollar per week emergency unemployment which was assumed to be paid out from October through this year.",50,,
334,0.97,2472.97,2481.378,And so that is in the Ih phase.,50,,
335,0.97,2481.378,2482.68,We believe that they are not going to make that.,50,,
336,0.97,2482.68,2492.79,"Although we may get a stimulus at some point, we don't know when that will be.",50,,
337,0.97,2492.79,2494.925,But we think it will be on the baseline forecast.,50,,
338,0.97,2494.925,2496.393,Personal income is expected to rise quite significantly.,50,,
339,0.97,2496.393,2507.738,"But again, looking at these, we believe it will be a little more than actual rise in income.",50,,
340,0.97,2507.738,2518.816,So that affects the future.,50,,
341,0.97,2518.816,2519.45,Next.,50,,
342,0.97,2519.45,2521.685,So now the regional economic forecast.,51,,
343,0.97,2521.685,2522.686,And these charts look roughly the same.,51,,
344,0.97,2522.686,2530.06,We are not expecting significant difference between the local area in the Seattle district.,51,,
345,0.97,2530.06,2530.728,It is slightly different.,51,,
346,0.97,2530.728,2535.966,We won't Belabor that.,51,,
347,0.97,2535.966,2545.609,It just shows the connection between the regional forecast and the regional economy and national economy.,51,,
348,0.97,2545.609,2555.92,You can see some statistics on the Left- hand side about how it might improve between the July and October forecast.,51,,
349,0.97,2555.92,2560.991,Moving to the next slide please.,51,,
350,0.97,2560.991,2562.96,I have been speaking to some of these.,51,,
351,0.97,2562.96,2572.603,We wanted to bring to your attention some of the risks that we wanted to raise.,51,,
352,0.97,2572.603,2576.273,Coronavirus cases this year and that is different from forecast assumptions.,51,,
353,0.97,2576.273,2585.783,A lot of this is next nation of why we are using a slower growth scenario relative to this.,51,,
354,0.97,2585.783,2589.253,"Again, the stimulus, we don't believe it will be available until later which will push back growth.",51,,
355,0.97,2589.253,2596.293,It will have a significant effect if and when.,51,,
356,0.97,2596.293,2604.301,Quote--we believe it will come later which delays our activity.,51,,
357,0.97,2604.301,2609.039,And Boeing announced additional layoffs which I think you have all probably scene.,51,,
358,0.97,2609.039,2609.573,It is worse than before.,51,,
359,0.97,2609.573,2616.146,About twice as many jobs are planned to be removed.,51,,
360,0.97,2616.146,2618.615,And they have not come out and said exactly how many will be local to our area.,51,,
361,0.97,2618.615,2626.29,But it is believed that the majority will be here in this area because of the commercial activity.,51,,
362,0.97,2626.29,2631.562,So that was not part of the forecast.,51,,
363,0.97,2631.562,2634.498,It is part of ours to the extent that we were aware of this.,51,,
364,0.97,2634.498,2642.74,"Finally, work from home is creating some uncertainty for us about being on the payroll tax revenues.",51,,
365,0.97,2642.74,2651.448,The basis for these taxes is where the work is getting done.,51,,
366,0.97,2651.448,2658.789,"And because people are working from home, we are uncertain how that will affect people's tax payments.",51,,
367,0.97,2658.789,2660.991,Let's pause here.,52,,
368,0.97,2660.991,2662.726,We are slightly ahead of time.,52,,
369,0.97,2662.726,2669.4,I want to take the chance to see if Councilmembers have had questions on previous slides.,52,,
370,0.97,2669.4,2672.036,"Since we are sort of speeding through this, I want to pause really quick.",52,,
371,0.97,2672.036,2672.703,I'm not seeing any hands.,52,,
372,0.97,2672.703,2679.81,I will ask a few questions.,52,,
373,0.97,2679.81,2682.713,Councilmember Pedersen.,52,,
374,0.97,2682.713,2688.952,"In terms of the uncertainty, is their something we will be doing to try to increase certainty?",53,,
375,0.97,2688.952,2708.338,"So the last bullet working from home creates high uncertainty regarding being on payroll tax revenue, one of my form a's is about having O he kept all caps her big businesses about what the 2022 lease plans are and will they renew them downtown or keep working from home?",53,,
376,0.97,2708.338,2722.586,"I'm just hoping that the executive is thinking about the plan for how to increase certainty around these questions because I know a lot of cities, more expensive cities are having to deal with this issue.",53,,
377,0.97,2722.586,2728.659,We included that report request Councilmember Pedersen.,54,,
378,0.97,2728.659,2738.001,I don't think that made it through but it is something we can always Revisit next year when we see how things start to settle.,55,,
379,0.97,2738.001,2738.435,Good question.,56,,
380,0.97,2738.435,2739.303,I will just pile on to your question.,56,,
381,0.97,2739.303,2743.474,I also had a question on this line.,56,,
382,0.97,2743.474,2750.013,"And maybe Dave, if you can take both of the questions related to the last bullet here.",56,,
383,0.97,2750.013,2755.619,"If you can talk about the work that talks about clearing up this uncertainty, similar to Councilmember Peterson's question.",56,,
384,0.97,2755.619,2767.197,And is this a clear negative resort is this also a possibility that it could result in something that is positive?,56,,
385,0.97,2767.197,2774.071,We are looking at all the data that we can to resolve the uncertainty.,57,,
386,0.97,2774.071,2781.445,We are receiving third quarter payments at this time.,57,,
387,0.97,2781.445,2788.352,You might not be able to see much evidence in the change in what people are paying.,57,,
388,0.97,2788.352,2802.032,We may have to wait for the 4TH quarter payments which will not come in until (Indiscernible) and we won't have a good understanding of that.,57,,
389,0.97,2802.032,2807.538,We are looking at other data as much as possible.,57,,
390,0.97,2807.538,2812.276,The lease information would be very valuable.,57,,
391,0.97,2812.276,2815.546,If we can Úget our hands on that.,57,,
392,0.97,2815.546,2843.473,"What we are doing--as I mentioned, we are trying to look at the tax payments and the reporting that is done with the tax and as I said, (Indiscernible) so I'm not sure we will be able to answer this question with much certainty until next year Unfortunately.",57,,
393,0.97,2843.473,2856.987,"One of the challenges we have is that for the BNO tax, one of the factors that determines it is where employment occurs.",58,,
394,0.97,2856.987,2860.657,It is a calculation that takes into account a full year of employee activities.,58,,
395,0.97,2860.657,2876.306,"So until we see the final payments for the year which we received by the middle of February, particularly at the end of January and a month after the end of the quarter and we take some time to process.",58,,
396,0.97,2876.306,2880.043,We have been looking for this in the data to date.,58,,
397,0.97,2880.043,2888.051,It is a year of calculation in terms of where employees have spent time overall.,58,,
398,0.97,2888.051,2892.99,It is critical to get the year end data for the bottom line.,58,,
399,0.97,2892.99,2902.666,So that will be something we share when we have that information.,58,,
400,0.97,2902.666,2903.133,Other questions?,59,,
401,0.97,2903.133,2906.97,"I will move on to my next question, Dave.",59,,
402,0.97,2906.97,2918.949,"The National IHS market data used for this forecast, puts us at a 30% chance of being corrected and a 70% chance of revenue being better.",59,,
403,0.97,2918.949,2924.955,Has IHS issued any Submental guidance that changes the probabilities?,59,,
404,0.97,2924.955,2925.222,No.,60,,
405,0.97,2925.222,2929.559,They produce that with each forecast.,60,,
406,0.97,2929.559,2934.364,And so they will be coming out with another forecast every month.,60,,
407,0.97,2934.364,2934.998,It may shift the probabilities.,60,,
408,0.97,2934.998,2944.741,The baseline was at 50%.,60,,
409,0.97,2944.741,2952.015,"So since May, has the actual revenue collection data been closer to the baseline forecast or the pessimistic forecast?",61,,
410,0.97,2952.015,2956.92,For the longest time it was tracking well to the pessimistic.,62,,
411,0.97,2956.92,2969.833,"As it turned, as the economy has turned up a little bit, it started to rise above the pessimistic toward the baseline . But it depends on which revenue stream we are talking about as well.",62,,
412,0.97,2969.833,2978.008,I get that there is this in Covid-19 and don't know how this will impact the economy in the coming year.,63,,
413,0.97,2978.008,3004.701,"I'm interested to know if there is any additional general fund revenue and how much additional general fund revenue would be generated in 2020 and in 2021 if revenue actually came in closer to the baseline forecast as they have been Trending towards and whether or not the baseline or the pessimistic forecast has more of a chance, more of a probability of being correct.",63,,
414,0.97,3004.701,3015.212,"With respect to the local economy, we firmly believe that the slow growth pessimistic forecast is a higher probability at this stage and for the reasons we described here.",64,,
415,0.97,3015.212,3027.124,The National forecast captures information at a national level and we think there are factors locally that influence how we should projected on to the local economy.,64,,
416,0.97,3027.124,3031.762,"In terms of its potential impact, the difference is very significant.",64,,
417,0.97,3031.762,3045.375,The baseline forecast would generate tens of millions more if it were to be realized.,64,,
418,0.97,3045.375,3062.225,But the communications we have are that we are closer to the slower growth still and the issues are identified here on the slide in terms of the risk going forward.,64,,
419,0.97,3062.225,3071.168,"But in terms of acceptable levels of risk, is that the rule of the budget office to determine the acceptable level of risk for the revenue forecast?",65,,
420,0.97,3071.168,3079.91,Or is that the Council's job to do given that we have the power of the legislative branch and the final budget?,65,,
421,0.97,3079.91,3090.253,It has been a task of the city revenue team in consultation with folks from throughout the city.,66,,
422,0.97,3090.253,3100.73,We shared all the detail and all the underlying assumptions in the central staff has done that throughout the year.,66,,
423,0.97,3100.73,3106.636,So I think that is the answer.,66,,
424,0.97,3106.636,3106.937,Okay.,67,,
425,0.97,3106.937,3109.539,A follow-up question.,67,,
426,0.97,3109.539,3112.375,This goes back to a few slides were we were looking at the possibility of Federal stimulus dollars.,67,,
427,0.97,3112.375,3123.22,"I guess a question about, how does the National Coronavirus infection rate change the local forecast?",67,,
428,0.97,3123.22,3125.322,And--to make.,67,,
429,0.97,3125.322,3131.561,The data we showed you on the infection rates are the local numbers.,68,,
430,0.97,3131.561,3132.429,We are seeing a spike here.,68,,
431,0.97,3132.429,3139.569,Ours is relative to where we have been.,68,,
432,0.97,3139.569,3140.437,But I'm not a public health expert.,68,,
433,0.97,3140.437,3150.113,I can tell you that it is concerning to them.,68,,
434,0.97,3150.113,3151.348,Can you let us know as well.,69,,
435,0.97,3151.348,3171.968,"If we continue to see Coronavirus continue to spike here in the Pacific Northwest and at higher rates across the nation, we want to be optimistic about what the Federal Government can potentially offer to us.",69,,
436,0.97,3171.968,3173.57,We know there is still a divided government at the national level.,69,,
437,0.97,3173.57,3187.417,Is it possible that the Federal stimulus dollars are not going to be given in 2020 but it is given in 2021?,69,,
438,0.97,3187.417,3188.818,"Wouldn't this just shift the revenue impact from 2020, to 2021?",69,,
439,0.97,3188.818,3189.252,It will delay.,70,,
440,0.97,3189.252,3192.989,The shift will have an impact.,70,,
441,0.97,3192.989,3196.76,So less money in 20--than less total money in 2021 in terms of revenue.,70,,
442,0.97,3196.76,3206.77,"The overall recovery will have been slow in all likelihood . and again, we fully--the Forecastle anticipates that there will be some Federal Tumulus.",70,,
443,0.97,3206.77,3212.075,Both slow growth and the baseline anticipate that.,70,,
444,0.97,3212.075,3224.387,It is a question of timing and a timing that underlies the National forecast--the stimulus would actually be available in October.,70,,
445,0.97,3224.387,3227.991,The National forecast was more than A-Month-Old.,70,,
446,0.97,3227.991,3229.726,We know that is not the case at this point.,70,,
447,0.97,3229.726,3236.733,I think every expectation will be additional Federal support.,70,,
448,0.97,3236.733,3241.871,It is unclear if that happens at your end or first thing next year but we fully anticipate that.,70,,
449,0.97,3241.871,3248.345,That delay will ultimately decrease the resources available in 20 and in 21.,70,,
450,0.97,3248.345,3251.514,Do you mind going back two slides.,71,,
451,0.97,3251.514,3252.682,I would like to take a look at slide number six.,71,,
452,0.97,3252.682,3264.294,"As we look at these trends here, is it possible that much of the proposed fiscal stimulus would be saved and not translate into economic activity for this year?",71,,
453,0.97,3264.294,3271.701,"The key is, to whom the stimulus is provided.",72,,
454,0.97,3271.701,3284.748,Folks saving or folks who--are earning money but don't necessarily have stimulus.,72,,
455,0.97,3284.748,3287.484,The previous unlimited Tumulus was really targeting those with lost income.,72,,
456,0.97,3287.484,3290.52,The expectation that the stimulus will largely be spent.,72,,
457,0.97,3290.52,3304.267,Maybe not all of it but the notion or the expectation is that stimulus targeted toward those that suffer job losses will translate into spending.,72,,
458,0.97,3304.267,3305.068,But there is the dynamic in there.,72,,
459,0.97,3305.068,3311.975,The uncertainty created overall by the virus has people thoughtful about the way they spend.,72,,
460,0.97,3311.975,3312.275,Okay.,73,,
461,0.97,3312.275,3317.48,Any additional questions.,73,,
462,0.97,3317.48,3318.415,Please go ahead Dave.,73,,
463,0.97,3318.415,3323.887,There is evidence that even those at the lower end of the income spectrum that receive stimulus checks save some of it.,74,,
464,0.97,3323.887,3336.766,It doesn't mean they's--didn't spend it later when they needed it at a later savings increase . part of the personal savings has gone up quite significantly.,74,,
465,0.97,3336.766,3338.768,Normally we are at about 7% on a regular basis.,74,,
466,0.97,3338.768,3347.277,And it has jumped up to about 14% this year.,74,,
467,0.97,3347.277,3349.379,Okay.,75,,
468,0.97,3349.379,3350.48,No additional questions.,75,,
469,0.97,3350.48,3359.989,"Do you mind, since we are taking a quick pause, can we go back one slide as well.",75,,
470,0.97,3359.989,3375.705,"So the data that was shared with central staff showed that since May, there have been steady monthly improvements in all major economic variables including GDP and in light of the continuing trend in the positive data, let me ask this one more time in a different way.",75,,
471,0.97,3375.705,3387.317,Why is the city budget's office decreasing revenue in the August forecast reflected especially when it appears from the research we have done with our peers that they were increasing their forecast?,75,,
472,0.97,3387.317,3400.13,I believe that was largely a timing issue.,76,,
473,0.97,3400.13,3406.302,They were making forecasts after we were making forecasts.,76,,
474,0.97,3406.302,3407.604,And so what we were seeing was a different time period.,76,,
475,0.97,3407.604,3412.041,And that resulted in a decrease.,76,,
476,0.97,3412.041,3419.549,And they had an additional month.,76,,
477,0.97,3419.549,3425.588,I don't know if two but just one where things started to turn up.,76,,
478,0.97,3425.588,3426.689,And so I think it is down to mostly timing.,76,,
479,0.97,3426.689,3430.66,The other issue is when they made the prior forecast against which they were comparing.,76,,
480,0.97,3430.66,3447.143,On so if they were particularly low on the original forecast and the growth or the lack thereof would show up just based on the timing of the base and the new forecast.,76,,
481,0.97,3447.143,3450.713,The initial forecast actually wasn't as dire as some at the state level.,77,,
482,0.97,3450.713,3453.383,We adjusted ours from a different base as well.,77,,
483,0.97,3453.383,3458.555,As well as a timing issue.,77,,
484,0.97,3458.555,3461.157,We are capturing the same similar growth to it they are showing.,78,,
485,0.97,3461.157,3465.595,It is just that we are doing it at a different time period.,78,,
486,0.97,3465.595,3466.196,That is helpful to know.,79,,
487,0.97,3466.196,3475.071,What's gone to slide number nine.,79,,
488,0.97,3475.071,3475.438,All right.,80,,
489,0.97,3475.438,3488.618,"Given large revisions to the National forecast and therefore the regional, we are seeing large (Indiscernible) and real estate excise tax and sales tax.",80,,
490,0.97,3488.618,3499.596,"Even as those are going up, we are seeing some of the other revenues that we have been discussing all morning about commercial parking tax, sweet and beverage task.",80,,
491,0.97,3499.596,3504.334,Some of those are declining.,80,,
492,0.97,3504.334,3507.904,There limited by the ability of people to move around and travel and so forth.,80,,
493,0.97,3507.904,3523.653,"And so we are seeing kind of a mixed picture . As you can see from the bullet points, you can see some of the changes going up in BNO sales.",80,,
494,0.97,3523.653,3526.022,And we are making similar adjustments to the retail sales.,80,,
495,0.97,3526.022,3535.965,"With King County and the others . for example, Western Washington University.",80,,
496,0.97,3535.965,3541.938,They took over the Puget sound economic forecast and are also showing improvements from the prior forecast.,80,,
497,0.97,3541.938,3542.372,Next slide.,80,,
498,0.97,3542.372,3549.679,Pausing really quick.,81,,
499,0.97,3549.679,3552.382,Is there any confidentiality here around the data or models?,81,,
500,0.97,3552.382,3557.153,I know that our team has been asking for the models and the data that support the forecast.,81,,
501,0.97,3557.153,3570.767,Just checking in to see what the Timeframe is or if there is any confidentiality concern we should be aware of because it would definitely like to see that.,81,,
502,0.97,3570.767,3572.201,Not in terms of the model or the input data.,82,,
503,0.97,3572.201,3579.142,We met with central staff and standing offering to do so.,82,,
504,0.97,3579.142,3581.244,No secrets on modeling whatsoever and never have been.,82,,
505,0.97,3581.244,3583.579,Great.,83,,
506,0.97,3583.579,3586.382,I will follow up.,83,,
507,0.97,3586.382,3586.816,Thank you so much.,83,,
508,0.97,3586.816,3587.951,Just for the purposes of transparency.,83,,
509,0.97,3587.951,3592.588,This is important information as we look at rounding out what risks and assumptions we are making in the forecast.,83,,
510,0.97,3592.588,3597.493,So we appreciate that offer and we look forward to taking you up on that.,83,,
511,0.97,3597.493,3603.032,Any other questions? okay.,83,,
512,0.97,3603.032,3607.87,Next slide.,84,,
513,0.97,3607.87,3613.309,So this is a summary of the change.,85,,
514,0.97,3613.309,3615.211,This is the November forecast.,85,,
515,0.97,3615.211,3624.12,"This forecast, previously the August forecast the basis of the 21 proposed.",85,,
516,0.97,3624.12,3628.191,So the left-hand column is for 2020 and the right column is 2021.,85,,
517,0.97,3628.191,3632.996,And just putting in the Two- year total column.,85,,
518,0.97,3632.996,3644.474,"For the general Fund, adding $36 million in the 2020 budget and 2021 budget we are adding 32.5 million for a total of 68.6 million.",85,,
519,0.97,3644.474,3652.181,"And as he discussed, through other general government revenues that have been dropping.",85,,
520,0.97,3652.181,3654.984,So those are in the Red.,85,,
521,0.97,3654.984,3665.762,And then when you take those out you end up with a two year total of resources sorted from a budgetary perspective.,85,,
522,0.97,3665.762,3687.45,"Real estate excise tax, we Continueto have a strong year and so that forecast was increased 12.7 million and for 2021, we are assuming more of a conservative growth of 2.9 million going forward.",85,,
523,0.97,3687.45,3688.618,So additional resources over the two year period.,85,,
524,0.97,3688.618,3693.589,And we separated out the benefit district.,85,,
525,0.97,3693.589,3702.131,You can see there that we are up about 2.3 million.,85,,
526,0.97,3702.131,3704.6,That is the increase from sales tax.,85,,
527,0.97,3704.6,3720.049,"Since we prepared the forecast, the vote last week, approved funding for 2021.",86,,
528,0.97,3720.049,3723.653,"And now, those resources, counsel plans to appropriate those which makes sense.",86,,
529,0.97,3723.653,3724.454,Because they are now in the books.,86,,
530,0.97,3724.454,3731.728,And we have a footnote on the next slide.,86,,
531,0.97,3731.728,3741.104,"And as you can see, we are expecting--no.",86,,
532,0.97,3741.104,3741.437,Next slide.,86,,
533,0.97,3741.437,3742.972,In the footnote number one about the sales tax.,86,,
534,0.97,3742.972,3745.541,We expect about $33.4 million.,86,,
535,0.97,3745.541,3755.318,That is the quarter estimate because we will not begin collecting the tax until April 1ST.,86,,
536,0.97,3755.318,3758.321,So there are a lot of numbers on this and we will have columns.,86,,
537,0.97,3758.321,3762.458,The left-hand side 2020 adopted budget from last year.,86,,
538,0.97,3762.458,3770.099,That is the November forecast from 2019.,86,,
539,0.97,3770.099,3770.8,And that can be compared.,86,,
540,0.97,3770.8,3780.51,"The two columns in the center, the 2020 change in the far side, 2021 November minus 2021 proposed.",86,,
541,0.97,3780.51,3784.313,They are showing the difference between the November forecast and the August forecast.,86,,
542,0.97,3784.313,3792.088,"Or as it says in 2020, there proposed there.",86,,
543,0.97,3792.088,3814.443,"If you use property taxes in 2021, because construction came in higher than anticipated, you can see what we discussed a moment ago in sales in BNO taxes.",86,,
544,0.97,3814.443,3815.645,No change in utility tax or payroll tax.,86,,
545,0.97,3815.645,3817.647,Parking is an interesting story.,86,,
546,0.97,3817.647,3830.393,"In 2021, the plan was prior to understanding fully what is going on out there in the economy and with the parking behavior.",86,,
547,0.97,3830.393,3843.139,I think the plan was to have--to increase parking rates back to a Pre-Covid-19 level more rapidly.,86,,
548,0.97,3843.139,3862.225,"And this reduction of 14.3 million, it acknowledges that we won't be getting there as quickly as first anticipated and Sdot will be undergoing various occupancy studies and raising rates in a more measured fashion as we go along, I believe.",86,,
549,0.97,3862.225,3863.726,That is the top panel.,86,,
550,0.97,3863.726,3866.929,"The general fund total, you can see there above the line.",86,,
551,0.97,3866.929,3870.9,Showing the 36 million in the center.,86,,
552,0.97,3870.9,3879.442,And 32.5 million in the far right-hand column.,86,,
553,0.97,3879.442,3885.615,"And the other general government revenues section which is the second set, you can see the texts.",86,,
554,0.97,3885.615,3886.148,Suites and beverage tax.,86,,
555,0.97,3886.148,3889.418,The Mercer Megabucks sale.,86,,
556,0.97,3889.418,3895.591,Commercial parking tax.,86,,
557,0.97,3895.591,3906.936,And some of the reductions there--and this is entirely due to the economy.,86,,
558,0.97,3906.936,3917.113,And the economy not responding as quickly as we perhaps originally anticipated.,86,,
559,0.97,3917.113,3924.02,Any questions?,87,,
560,0.97,3924.02,3924.353,Sorry.,88,,
561,0.97,3924.353,3925.488,I thought you were taking a pause for questions.,88,,
562,0.97,3925.488,3931.761,It might have just been a Glitch.,88,,
563,0.97,3931.761,3946.075,"With 9.2 million, that was the decision to acknowledge that it was not opening in person until the fall of 2021.",89,,
564,0.97,3946.075,3951.547,That is where that dropped comes from.,89,,
565,0.97,3951.547,3968.497,"Back to my point earlier, colleagues, about my ongoing questions about how much school programming or alternatives to traditional schooling is still happening at our schools and recognizing that families are still Accessing Playgrounds and open spaces there.",90,,
566,0.97,3968.497,3970.466,I'm still looking into this issue area as well.,90,,
567,0.97,3970.466,3973.002,Because we want traffic to be responsible around the schools.,90,,
568,0.97,3973.002,3973.436,Questions so far?,90,,
569,0.97,3973.436,3979.608,I know it is a dense slide here.,90,,
570,0.97,3979.608,3979.809,Okay.,90,,
571,0.97,3979.809,3985.715,No questions so far.,90,,
572,0.97,3985.715,3985.981,Okay.,91,,
573,0.97,3985.981,3986.382,So the next.,92,,
574,0.97,3986.382,3991.62,Grand total general government resources.,92,,
575,0.97,3991.62,3998.894,"As you can see, it is the sum of the general Fund and the other government resources total.",92,,
576,0.97,3998.894,4009.305,And so about 29.4 million in resources coming out of 2020 and about 12.2 coming out of 2021.,92,,
577,0.97,4009.305,4017.079,And then we have the separate line for tax and you can see the increases there.,92,,
578,0.97,4017.079,4020.516,And the transportation benefit district rounds out the slide.,92,,
579,0.97,4020.516,4041.871,"And that showed current law prior to these and so as you know, the vehicle license, the 60-Dollar portion expired as to the 1% sales tax portion.",92,,
580,0.97,4041.871,4052.181,"(Indiscernible) with election, we added 1 point--or .15% tax rate for the sales tax should generate 33.42021 million.",92,,
581,0.97,4052.181,4064.86,But we get to continue with 20-Dollar vehicle license fee which was provided and it is about 7.2 million.,92,,
582,0.97,4064.86,4071.534,"And with that, I think that COMPLETES.",92,,
583,0.97,4071.534,4071.901,Thank you.,93,,
584,0.97,4071.901,4077.773,"I'm not seeing any questions, Dave.",93,,

586,0.97,4078.974,4083.012,There is a bit of a delay.,93,,
587,0.97,4083.012,4084.78,Did you have anything else to add?,93,,
588,0.97,4084.78,4085.047,No.,94,,
589,0.97,4085.047,4087.016,Thank you both.,95,,

592,0.97,4090.92,4107.336,We appreciate you answering my questions as we try to sort through the various options that counsel still has as the legislative branch considers its responsibility to allocate funding in a responsible way.,95,,
593,0.97,4107.336,4112.274,I also want to note that I had asked Aly at the beginning to clarify as well.,95,,
594,0.97,4112.274,4125.254,We continue to see references to $57 million in net new funding and we did offer clarification about the way in which the parameters are around them and we have discussed a few times today as we talked about investment.,95,,
595,0.97,4125.254,4129.859,So again thank you to Alie for offering that clarification so that we can see how that bucket is actually split up.,95,,
596,0.97,4129.859,4134.163,And it is not in the general fund.,95,,
597,0.97,4134.163,4140.402,Just wanted you all to be aware in case he did not catch the beginning of this meeting.,95,,

627,0.97,4300.963,4324.42,"I think the intent is for many of those pieces of budget related legislation to appear on the introduction referral calendar for this Monday in order for us to be able to take action on budget related legislation on--sorry, I am Lookig at my calendar.",101,,
