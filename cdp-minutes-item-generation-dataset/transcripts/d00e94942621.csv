41,0.97,256.689,262.228,Let's move ton the next Speaker.,6,,
42,0.97,262.228,262.629,David Hanes.,6,,
43,0.97,262.629,268.134,Neither of these participants or speakers who have signed up are here.,6,,
44,0.97,268.134,270.837,So we will move on.,6,,
45,0.97,271.137,293.726,"Before we get into today's business items, I would like to just touch on some of the things that I'm looking forward to covering in this Committee and what I want to accomplish.",6,,
46,0.97,293.726,306.873,"So as the first small business owner on city council in over a decade, you can bet I'm 100% committed to helping small businesses survive the pandemic and just to make it easier to start and grow a business in Seattle.",6,,
47,0.97,306.873,331.464,"Because it's not just about the entrepreneurs but also about jobs and preserving the nodes of our community, the fabric of our neighborhoods so I'll be working closely with Oed the office of economic development to support and expand their services and programs and I'll put a plug in here that Oed needs more resources.",6,,
48,0.97,331.464,341.607,But my job is to seek ways the city can do even more to strengthen our business community and achieve inequitable recovery.,6,,
49,0.97,341.607,346.279,Some of my efforts are going beyond the confines of the work plan.,6,,
50,0.97,346.279,358.458,Some of my top priorities in the realm of economic development include downtown and neighborhood business district revitalization.,6,,
51,0.97,358.458,369.369,So since day one my staff and I have been working at City Hall and being downtown every day really does drive home the devastation rot by the pandemic.,6,,
52,0.97,369.369,372.171,The closed Venues and boarded up windows.,6,,
53,0.97,372.171,376.209,I was really disappointed to find out that the Arctic room is closed.,6,,
54,0.97,376.209,382.982,That used to be a favorite haunt of staffers back in the day.,6,,
55,0.97,382.982,383.549,Collins is also closed.,6,,
56,0.97,383.549,395.561,So we as a city have to focus on doing everything we possibly can to create the conditions for businesses and organizations to well first of all to locate here.,6,,
57,0.97,395.561,405.271,To choose Seattle as their home but also for existing businesses to bring employees back downtown.,6,,
58,0.97,405.271,416.182,It also means making downtown more welcoming for visitors and also more livable for the residents because we are a neighborhood down here.,6,,
59,0.97,416.182,428.094,"Bottom line, our region and cities general fund depends on a healthy downtown so all put the same focus on neighborhood businesses that's where quality of life is.",6,,
60,0.97,428.094,442.642,People need to be able to work and play.,6,,
61,0.97,442.642,445.678,And recreate close to where they live.,6,,
62,0.97,445.678,453.286,A top priority for me is also reducing the displacement of small businesses.,6,,
63,0.97,453.286,470.636,No surprise that lack of access to capital is a huge challenge for entrepreneurs but especially in neighborhoods like the CD and Rainier valley.,6,,
64,0.97,470.636,488.087,"Okay technology, I want to clarify for the viewing public that the technology and the title of this committee name is referring to the work of Seattle it.",6,,
65,0.97,488.087,489.689,The information technology Department.,6,,
66,0.97,489.689,495.294,They're the folks in charge of the Seattle Channel.,6,,
67,0.97,495.294,495.595,Thank you.,6,,
68,0.97,495.595,495.895,My favorite.,6,,
69,0.97,495.895,505.238,"And also policy initiatives like Digital equity and all the software and hardware that keeps our Website going and keeps employees computers connected, etc.",6,,
70,0.97,505.238,511.177,So that's going to be a big focus of my committee.,6,,
71,0.97,511.177,513.913,Then let's move on to city light.,6,,
72,0.97,513.913,521.187,Seattle is lucky to have a publicly own utility.,6,,
73,0.97,521.187,543.142,City light generates legislation to keep the lights on so my goal is to make sure the legislation flows through my committee efficiently and also that I provide the critical oversight to protect rate payers in our very important critical infrastructure.,6,,
74,0.97,543.142,577.476,So it's been noted and I've said is that I am an Environmentalist at heart and I believe that a lot of the important work to reach our climate prediction goals will happen in utilities like city light so I'm particularly interested in working with and supporting the utilities investments in Electrify occasion and some of its newer work which I'll get into later in the meeting.,6,,
75,0.97,577.476,580.479,So that is in a nutshell--I could have gone on.,6,,
76,0.97,580.479,587.019,I cut massive parts here--but that's the work we're doing in the committee.,6,,
77,0.97,587.019,605.137,"This combination of departments and so I wanted you to know what we're focusing on and before we move on, I do want to take a moment to acknowledge what a lot of our committees have been hearing.",6,,
78,0.97,605.137,611.143,To acknowledge the escalating crime that small businesses are experiencing.,6,,
79,0.97,611.143,614.914,Because public safety is a core foundation of our recovery.,6,,
80,0.97,614.914,624.624,And my office is getting a lot of calls and E-Mails from small business owners and representatives of neighborhood business districts.,6,,
81,0.97,624.624,634.6,"Just the pressing frustration and anger and frankly, desperation at what they see is a total break down of social contract when it comes to public safety.",6,,
82,0.97,634.6,645.711,"So in one Email this went out to all Council members, the director of the University district partnership wrote to us.",6,,
83,0.97,645.711,656.055,"He says, our community is under attack from a recent massive surge in vandalism and highly visible disturbances and life threatening behavior.",6,,
84,0.97,656.055,673.973,"He goes on to say in the last few weeks Alae, over 20 businesses have had their windows bashed in, melted and removed all together during a string of events ranging from repeated act of rage to coordinated theft rings.",6,,
85,0.97,673.973,674.707,So that's an example.,6,,
86,0.97,674.707,698.264,And another person who reached out to our offense Reneer Rickson who owns several fabulous restaurants wrote in to talk about what's happening to her restaurant on Lake Union and she basically says we are basically begging the city to show that they do Prioritize the well-being and safety of our staff and guests along North Lake way.,6,,
87,0.97,698.264,700.633,The problem is getting worse every day.,6,,
88,0.97,700.633,707.44,Nothing is changing and our concerns are being unanswered.,6,,
89,0.97,707.44,716.248,"So these are examples and I'm hearing from businesses Columbia city West Seattle, all over the city and all kinds of different businesses.",6,,
90,0.97,716.248,720.92,The people contacting my office are basically feeling abandoned by city leaders.,6,,
91,0.97,720.92,730.262,I'm not trying to put anybody on the spot but as chair of economic development I feel a duty to give voice to them.,6,,
92,0.97,730.262,739.238,These businesses and at our next committee meeting we will likely have a panel of business leaders and owners.,6,,
93,0.97,739.238,747.213,Just to talk about their stories and maybe come with some solutions that we can implement right now.,6,,
94,0.97,747.213,750.916,Some actions not solutions but some actions.,6,,
95,0.97,750.916,756.122,Because of course this is a huge complicated very complicated problem.,6,,
96,0.97,756.122,762.695,I know that we're not going to arrest our way out of this issue and I'm not calling for a cop in front of every shop.,6,,
97,0.97,762.695,765.431,But we have to do something.,6,,
98,0.97,765.431,767.633,Because these small businesses need help.,6,,
99,0.97,767.633,770.402,I honestly don't know what that looks like.,6,,
100,0.97,770.402,771.937,Frankly I'll lay it out there.,6,,
101,0.97,771.937,777.977,But for right now I want to say to them that I hear you.,6,,
102,0.97,777.977,783.415,And I'm here to be your advocate.,6,,
103,0.97,783.415,783.949,And work Collaboratively.,6,,
104,0.97,783.949,786.585,This is the key thing.,6,,
105,0.97,786.585,802.868,Work with my colleagues Collaboratively under the leadership of our President Council member Juarez to really put our heads together and work on sustainable solution to this public safety crisis.,6,,
106,0.97,802.868,814.046,We can't just simply not do anything and we most of all we can't lose these jobs and these businesses and these gathering places in the community.,6,,
107,0.97,814.046,817.283,I just wanted to say that.,6,,
108,0.97,817.283,826.091,And now we can move on to the items of our business.,6,,
109,0.97,826.091,831.831,"I recognize that Council member Herbold has just joined, so thank you very much.",6,,
110,0.97,832.131,842.775,"Item one, will the clerk please read item one in the record.",6,,
111,0.97,842.775,854.92,Council bill 120 an ordinance relating to the city light Department authorizing the Department to accept as sole owner of fiber Cable and associated facilities previously shared with the University of Washington.,7,,
112,0.97,854.92,856.789,Briefing discussion will be possible for a vote.,7,,
113,0.97,857.089,857.923,.,7,,
114,0.97,858.224,862.228,"All right, hello will the Presenters for this item introduce yourselves.",8,,
115,0.97,862.528,863.996,.,8,,

120,0.97,888.254,888.754,That's less confusing.,9,,

122,0.97,891.123,896.128,Thank you very much for your comments Council member Nelson.,9,,

133,0.97,953.319,963.295,.,13,,
134,0.97,967.533,975.174,I'm Claire Lloyd and a manage the engineering team for Seattle city light.,14,,
135,0.97,975.174,985.284,Requesting authorization to accept memorandum of agreement allowing the University of Washington to abandon ownership of shared fiber Cable 160.,14,,
136,0.97,985.284,994.793,This Cable along with physical plant Conduit were jointly installed by Seattle city light and the University of Washington in 1990.,14,,
137,0.97,994.793,1008.14,At the time University of Washington needed communications to its temporary Bothel campus.,14,,
138,0.97,1008.14,1014.68,They use it to generate to Boathel and Skajt.,14,,
139,0.97,1014.68,1025.224,"This is used to control the generation facilities and transports phone, radio, television, control and data communications traffic.",14,,
140,0.97,1025.224,1031.563,Seattle city light replaced the Cable in 2019.,14,,
141,0.97,1031.563,1031.93,"Next slide, please.",14,,
142,0.97,1032.231,1053.118,The previously shared underground Cable runs from the intersection of 141St 5th Street and 37th Avenue northeast to Boathel the intersection of 228Th Street Southeast and 29th drive Southeast.,14,,
143,0.97,1053.118,1066.298,In the original agreement Seattle city light owned 48 strands of the fiber and the University of Washington owned 96 strands of the fiber within the 144 strand fiber Cable.,14,,
144,0.97,1066.298,1072.037,The Moa acknowledges Seattle city lights ownership of the full capacity of the new 144 strand Cable.,14,,
145,0.97,1072.337,1077.943,Next slide.,14,,
146,0.97,1079.011,1087.986,The original Cable was installed in 1990 and in 2015 it was determined the Cable was degraded in need of replacement.,14,,
147,0.97,1087.986,1094.059,Prior to replacing the Cable Seattle city light asked the University of Washington if they would like to participate in the project.,14,,
148,0.97,1094.359,1102.801,We received an Email from their representative confirming their intent to abandon their interests.,14,,
149,0.97,1102.801,1106.972,University of Washington no longer occupied the temporary campus.,14,,
150,0.97,1106.972,1124.056,At the time there were only two fiber cables an airline fiber Cable 157 and this underground Cable serving the Seattle city light network to Boathel Substation and generation sites.,14,,
151,0.97,1124.056,1131.663,If one Cable was cut or damaged data traffic would automatically Reroute.,14,,
152,0.97,1131.663,1143.375,The redundant fiber Cable 157 was and still is intermittently being taken out of service because of the city of Boathel and the beautify occasion projects.,14,,
153,0.97,1143.375,1150.282,And that left this Cable as the only reliable route prior to the signal quality degrading.,14,,
154,0.97,1150.282,1155.621,This prompted the urgent need to replace the Cable.,14,,
155,0.97,1155.621,1164.863,Design was completed in 2017 and insulation occurred in 2018 and was finalized in January 2019.,14,,
156,0.97,1164.863,1168.367,The fiber replacement cost was 1.300-0000.,14,,
157,0.97,1168.367,1178.81,The project was funded in our capital Prom Y 9307 which addresses fiber insulation and needs.,14,,
158,0.97,1179.111,1187.653,This does not require additional funds.,14,,
159,0.97,1187.653,1194.359,Thank you for your time and do you have any questions?,14,,
160,0.97,1194.359,1202.768,.,15,,
161,0.97,1202.768,1207.105,"Eric and the Council central staff, I think the presentation was great.",16,,
162,0.97,1207.105,1210.342,Thank you very much.,16,,
163,0.97,1210.342,1223.322,And this is sometimes what we call ministerial decisions because it involves something that can be owned or has a property interest and that sort of thing.,16,,
164,0.97,1223.322,1231.663,"It's appropriate to be here but I have no issues to raise or additional comments, thanks for asking.",16,,
165,0.97,1231.663,1235.767,"All right, any questions from colleagues?",17,,
166,0.97,1235.767,1243.442,"Seeing none, I move the committee to recommend passage of Council bill 120260.",17,,
167,0.97,1243.442,1245.043,Is there a second?,17,,
168,0.97,1245.043,1245.744,Second.,18,,
169,0.97,1245.744,1250.949,It's been moved in second and to recommend passage of the bill.,19,,
170,0.97,1250.949,1257.055,Are there any further comments?,19,,

189,0.97,1366.665,1367.099,"Next slide, Chris.",25,,
190,0.97,1367.099,1374.272,As by virtue of that we have an operating license with Frc renewed back in 2014.,25,,
191,0.97,1374.272,1390.455,The add Jay Sen SI to the boundary dam and our licensed development out there in North ponder are adjacent and overlap the tribal lands for the tribe of Indians in the region.,25,,
192,0.97,1390.455,1398.096,Like Council member Nelson mentioned this is an updated agreement that some of you participated in back in 2016.,25,,
193,0.97,1398.096,1424.189,"And I think it shares our desire and the tribes desire to move work force development in the North county in particular creating opportunities for the community, tribe and eventually to build construction and skilled trades work force in the region that it hopefully city light and the tribe and other businesses will benefit from.",25,,
194,0.97,1424.189,1432.497,We're one of several local participants that are participating in the bill career training center.,25,,
195,0.97,1432.497,1436.802,Like the Pod and others in the area are also contributing to those.,25,,
196,0.97,1436.802,1437.068,So next slide.,25,,
197,0.97,1437.369,1444.209,This legislation like I said is ongoing.,25,,
198,0.97,1444.209,1449.514,To renew an agreement that expired last year.,25,,
199,0.97,1449.514,1454.119,"Total value of our contributions for the five year agreement is $213,000.",25,,
200,0.97,1454.419,1473.004,"I think I mentioned that this is a benefit to the community to the work force development, particularly skilled trades construction trades and high school counseling, career development for high school kids.",25,,
201,0.97,1473.004,1479.544,And it is extended benefit to not just tribe but community.,25,,
202,0.97,1479.544,1483.615,That's one of the great things about the bill operates.,25,,
203,0.97,1483.615,1486.918,Their partnerships in the region.,25,,
204,0.97,1486.918,1509.808,So just as part of our operating license for the boundary project we do have many foreign wide relations with the tribe that extend not only from our project but the Tributaries to the Ponderary River and lots of resource enhancements and development work we have done as part of our licensed work.,25,,
205,0.97,1509.808,1520.952,The tribe has been a great partner for us throughout the current license from 2014 and even many years prior to that.,25,,
206,0.97,1520.952,1521.286,"Next slide, Chris.",25,,
207,0.97,1521.586,1540.272,"Just a few Metrics that we do get reporting from the tribe and others, who is the chair just to make sure we're seeing progress and benefits to the community.",25,,
208,0.97,1540.272,1551.95,We ask that they share some of their results with us on an annual basis so you can see here the great things that come out of the last year.,25,,
209,0.97,1551.95,1555.42,"7 apprentices completed their 7,000 error program.",25,,
210,0.97,1555.42,1558.123,Some have gained full-time employment in skilled trades.,25,,
211,0.97,1558.123,1572.704,And then you can see also that partnership with the Agc and city light group health foundation graduated five high school students through the head start program and construction trades this last summer.,25,,
212,0.97,1572.704,1585.85,Students are working at their northern quest operation through their cows Bell metal products group which is the precursor to the Ktct.,25,,
213,0.97,1585.85,1589.254,"So anyway, that's the background.",25,,
214,0.97,1589.254,1594.326,That's the nexus to why it's important to us but also to the community.,25,,
215,0.97,1594.326,1598.229,We look forward to answering any questions.,25,,

224,0.97,1646.611,1657.655,Work force development is a priority for me and I'm glad that we as a city are able to contribute to the tribe and community adjacent to the facility.,28,,
225,0.97,1657.655,1668.133,So I fully support this piece of legislation and I move that the committee recommends passage of Council bill 120259.,28,,

242,0.97,1708.64,1714.779,Will the clerk please read item three into the record?,40,,
243,0.97,1714.779,1715.313,Resolution 32040.,41,,
244,0.97,1715.313,1727.959,The resolution relating to the city light Department affirming the city light Department's clean energy implementation plan as required under Washington state's clean energy transformation act.,41,,
245,0.97,1727.959,1728.76,Briefing discussion and possible vote.,41,,
246,0.97,1729.06,1754.586,"All right so this item reinforces what I said in my previous remarks about city light being a department where work to reduce carbon emissions as the city takes place and I'm excited to be chair belonging to the first clean energy implementation plan, a requirement under the clean energy transformation act adopted into law in 2019.",41,,
247,0.97,1754.586,1759.758,"So with that, are there any new Presenters?",41,,
248,0.97,1759.758,1759.958,Josh?,41,,
249,0.97,1759.958,1766.164,"Yeah, I was just going to introduce you to Josh Walter who is an awesome member of our staff.",42,,
250,0.97,1766.164,1775.607,Right now is kind of single Handedly keeping a lot of balls in the air so it's not just around here but he's doing a ton.,42,,
251,0.97,1775.607,1781.98,We have a lot happening in this area that we will be talking with you about in the coming years.,42,,
252,0.97,1781.98,1786.084,"So Josh, go for it.",42,,
253,0.97,1786.084,1790.421,"Thank you, appreciate the introduction, Deborah.",43,,
254,0.97,1790.421,1793.291,And I'll wait for Chris to start the slide back.,43,,
255,0.97,1793.591,1797.228,Great.,43,,
256,0.97,1797.929,1811.176,"So good morning Council members and chair Nelson my name is Josh Walter, I manage our regional affairs and wholesale contracts team at City light.",43,,
257,0.97,1811.176,1818.049,I'll start by setting the stage of our current resource portfolio and emissions characteristics.,43,,
258,0.97,1818.049,1820.418,Or categories of those resources.,43,,
259,0.97,1820.418,1835.166,"As you can see here, we have an energy supply mix of more than 90% carbon free resources being used to help supply our energy needs for customers.",43,,
260,0.97,1835.166,1840.271,We have been carbon free for nearly two decades.,43,,
261,0.97,1840.271,1860.391,And have been a Netzero carbon neutral utility since 2005 thanks to the leadership of city council on the city for recognizing and showing a commitment to becoming carbon free.,43,,
262,0.97,1860.391,1865.964,On average as mentioned we are 90% carbon free.,43,,
263,0.97,1865.964,1874.439,And we do not own or contract on any long term basis in emitting resource.,43,,
264,0.97,1874.439,1880.578,There are some elements or item that is we need to keep track of associated with the emissions.,43,,
265,0.97,1880.578,1885.817,Specifically the idea of unspecified resources.,43,,
266,0.97,1885.817,1890.088,Those are largely done to meet our balancing needs.,43,,
267,0.97,1890.088,1896.928,On a near term basis but there's no long term emitting resources in our resource portfolio.,43,,
268,0.97,1897.228,1911.476,"As in addition to our current resource mix, we are also planning on bringing on new renewable resources.",43,,
269,0.97,1911.476,1926.19,In the near term in the near future one starting in 2024 most likely and additional resources in the 2026 time frame.,43,,
270,0.97,1926.19,1926.424,Next slide.,43,,
271,0.97,1926.724,1946.344,"So as it relates to the current presentation and the request to approve our CIP, this is an element associated with Cida passed in 2019.",44,,
272,0.97,1946.344,1961.793,Setting certain benchmarks for the utility or for all utilities in Washington State to clean up their energy mix starting in 2025.,44,,
273,0.97,1961.793,1970.268,And ending or starting 100% renewable or Nonemitting resources in 2045.,44,,
274,0.97,1970.268,1989.887,"Those benchmarks are those time elements of actions and are in 2025 utilities must eliminate all coal fire electric generation owned or purchased on a long term basis in 2030, utilities must be carbon neutral.",44,,
275,0.97,1989.887,2007.005,"With 80% of their resource mix coming from Renewables or Nonemitting resources and in 2045, utilities will be required to show that they're meeting 100% of their energy needs through renewable or Nonemitting resources.",44,,
276,0.97,2007.305,2011.275,Next slide.,44,,
277,0.97,2012.076,2030.461,So some of the other Cida provisions are that in addition to creating a plan to show utilities how to meet these targets utilities we must seek approval from our governing body.,44,,
278,0.97,2030.461,2042.273,We must adopt and file an proved Ceip every four years demonstrating progress towards meeting the goals stated earlier.,44,,
279,0.97,2042.273,2046.577,480 by 2030 and 100% by 2045.,44,,
280,0.97,2046.577,2052.016,"Upon approval, this will be filed with the Washington State Department of Commerce.",44,,
281,0.97,2052.016,2057.655,And posted on our Website.,44,,
282,0.97,2057.655,2080.411,So utilities Additionally utilities must also ensure equitable distribution of energy and Nonenergy benefits as we collectively transition to clean energy for not only the utility Seattle but for all utilities in Washington state.,44,,
283,0.97,2080.411,2080.645,Next slide.,44,,
284,0.97,2080.945,2098.396,"Since we're already above the initial target of carbon free on a resource basis, our first CIP largely focuses on clean energy equity.",45,,
285,0.97,2098.396,2100.164,Energy efficiency and demand response.,45,,
286,0.97,2100.164,2122.253,"That being said the plan for Irp or integrated resource plan identifies the need to invest in New Renewables as stated earlier, one planned to be brought on for renewable plus program in 2024.",45,,
287,0.97,2122.253,2130.728,And an additional resource needed in the 2026-2027 time frame.,45,,
288,0.97,2130.728,2137.368,A portfolio of action is identified in our clean energy equity plan.,45,,
289,0.97,2137.368,2140.838,Which is attached to the legislative pact.,45,,
290,0.97,2140.838,2153.718,But a highlight of some of the categories of themes associated with the actions are Affordability and Affordability projects and programs.,45,,
291,0.97,2153.718,2158.623,Reliability projects and energy efficiency projects and programs.,45,,
292,0.97,2158.623,2169.634,Renewable procurement again as stated earlier including the renewable plus program.,45,,
293,0.97,2169.634,2177.308,And transportation Electrify Electrifycation products.,45,,
294,0.97,2177.308,2200.798,"In addition to the portfolio action the Ceip and Ceep the clean energy equity plan, focuses on city lights values including being a customer focused utility and equitable connection to customers in community.",45,,
295,0.97,2200.798,2215.913,"Per regulation, we must consider long and short term public health in environmental benefits reduction of costs and risks and energy security in resiliency.",45,,
296,0.97,2215.913,2216.347,Excuse me for a second.,45,,
297,0.97,2216.647,2235.9,The clean energy equity plan is an integral part of the overall Ceip to guide the you Tills integration of equity into its planning programs and projects.,45,,
298,0.97,2236.2,2237.668,"Next slide, please.",45,,
299,0.97,2238.436,2259.323,So as part of the development of Cida Ncep utility conducted a clean energy future survey to gauge customers concerns and understandings of the issues pertaining to clean energy.,45,,
300,0.97,2259.323,2275.139,This was an incredibly helpful tool in helping inform the utility of the most important aspects of implementing clean energy goals currently and in the future.,45,,
301,0.97,2275.139,2286.55,The response was statistically significant and included responses from a wide variety of customer categories at a high confidence level as seen in this slide here.,45,,
302,0.97,2286.851,2290.087,"Next slide, please.",46,,
303,0.97,2291.289,2323.587,The outcomes of the survey are found here where 94% of the Respondants to the survey were concerned about climate change and 80% of the customers were not aware of city lights carbon neutrality or has a 90% clean energy portfolio currently or to begin with.,46,,
304,0.97,2323.587,2341.872,There were the highlight of the most important elements were seen here in green and the greatest concerns in the Orange box.,46,,
305,0.97,2341.872,2349.28,"So the concerns being bill increases, negative impacts of clean energy technology and reliability.",46,,
306,0.97,2349.28,2377.875,"There were based on the demographics for the customer classifications, Renters and low income Reupon Dants have slightly different responses those being bill increases, negative impact to clean Tech and construction impacts and the Hispanic Latino response had in their top three bill increases construction impacts and a negative impact from clean Tech.",46,,
307,0.97,2378.175,2379.944,"Next slide, please.",46,,
308,0.97,2380.711,2417.548,"As it results being only one component to the tool box in achieving the utility goals and plans, the Ceip is Holy consistent with our ongoing and upcoming strategic plan, race in social justice initiatives, the green new deal and various enlisted additional regulatory requirements from the state and city level.",47,,
309,0.97,2417.548,2417.782,Next slide.,47,,
310,0.97,2418.082,2444.308,"And to wrap things up, there's certain upcoming issues and items that are not specifically add Dwresed in the current Ceip but have been identified for future inclusion but have been identified in the next Ceip.",47,,
311,0.97,2444.308,2455.052,This is something that we will continue to come back on a rolling four year basis to show what our plans are.,47,,
312,0.97,2455.352,2467.665,And the progress towards achieving the goals as set out in the Ceip.,47,,
313,0.97,2467.665,2485.883,"So examples of the future Onsiderations that could, should and most likely will be included in the next generation of the Ceip include emissions considerations.",47,,
314,0.97,2485.883,2493.457,"The new Bonneville power administration contract, which the current one is set to expire in 2028.",47,,
315,0.97,2493.457,2505.87,"So we are currently starting to develop and think about a future Bonneville contract even today, seven years in advance of the expiration of that contract.",47,,
316,0.97,2505.87,2506.437,Resource adequacy.,47,,
317,0.97,2506.437,2539.27,Above and beyond what is currently being considered in the integrated resource plan and the expansion of regional energy markets that will only help in the coordination between Western utilities on a planning and operational basis which will move and go above and beyond the successes of the Western energy and balance market we have been participating in the last year and a half or so.,47,,
318,0.97,2539.27,2543.841,So that concludes my presentation.,47,,
319,0.97,2543.841,2548.312,I appreciate the opportunity to present and I'm happy to answer any questions.,47,,
320,0.97,2548.612,2554.318,Okay.,48,,
321,0.97,2555.92,2558.589,"Eric, any additional comments?",48,,
322,0.97,2558.589,2560.157,Just an observation.,49,,
323,0.97,2560.157,2577.274,"When plans like this from city light come to Council, I think they're in my opinion a great window into the sweep and scope of the utility.",49,,
324,0.97,2577.274,2581.512,I'm always Wowed by it so I appreciate the presentation.,49,,
325,0.97,2581.512,2585.182,A lot to cover there.,49,,
326,0.97,2585.182,2591.355,"Another comment my opinion, city light is often at the forefront of these issues statewide.",49,,
327,0.97,2591.355,2607.271,So new state law that constrains or directs utilities and in this case that's also exhibited.,49,,
328,0.97,2607.271,2611.375,A lot of the things city light is looking for.,49,,
329,0.97,2611.375,2616.08,In consistent with the city of Seattle in general.,49,,
330,0.97,2616.08,2626.256,"Just observations and with that, unless I can help out with something else, I'll just fade in the background here.",49,,
331,0.97,2626.256,2632.129,"Okay, anybody have any questions or comments?",50,,
332,0.97,2632.129,2632.896,"Well, I have some.",50,,
333,0.97,2632.896,2659.59,"So one thing that caught my attention on attachment one of the plan, it says this on the agenda, on page 3 a change in resource mix and new loads from decor Bonnization across transportation Industries will require city light to expand beyond Hydro power resources.",50,,
334,0.97,2659.59,2679.376,"That caught my attention because I'm a fan of what sometime called bio power that takes solid waste, food scraps, things like that and converts it into methane that can be converted into electricity.",50,,
335,0.97,2679.376,2684.348,And why might I be a big fan of that?,50,,
336,0.97,2684.348,2692.089,It's because brewers make a lot of grain through the brewing process.,50,,
337,0.97,2692.089,2696.86,"For example, my brewery made about 10,000 pounds a day.",50,,
338,0.97,2696.86,2707.304,So every brewer has a relationship with a farmer that comes and gets the train out of the city for livestock or whatever else.,50,,
339,0.97,2707.304,2712.81,So that's inefficient lots of emissions and I've been promoting this technology for a long time.,50,,
340,0.97,2712.81,2728.125,"We had a pilot project that did just that, very small amount of our spent grain to just prove that technology works and suns then others are being employed at a hospital.",50,,
341,0.97,2728.125,2747.611,"Microsoft has one of these Anner Robic Digesters on site so I'm just wondering if by other resources if you're at all looking at something like that and whether or not you are, what other resources are you talking about?",50,,
342,0.97,2747.611,2747.978,Wind or solar?,50,,
343,0.97,2747.978,2748.178,What?,50,,
344,0.97,2748.178,2760.057,"I would say yes, it's an all of the above approach.",51,,
345,0.97,2760.057,2772.069,"We, did an all renewable resource request for proposals as it relates to the renewable plus program.",51,,
346,0.97,2772.069,2781.678,Most of the resources for the developers that responded responded with wind or solar resources.,51,,
347,0.97,2781.678,2794.224,"So that's a matter of scale, the largest type of projects that are seen developed.",51,,
348,0.97,2794.224,2812.409,"But as it relates to your idea behind methane or bio fuels as a potential source, we do have a small land fill gas project we are an off taker of.",51,,
349,0.97,2812.409,2844.007,"And as a part of our I-937 compliance requirements, we also purchased the REX from daughter RI Digesters so we're not necessarily an energy off taker for the dairy Digesters but we do purchase on a regular basis the renewable energy credits of these types of projects you're talking about to help with our I--937 compliance.",51,,
350,0.97,2844.007,2849.379,It's not for the sake of us not interested in those types of Technologies.,51,,
351,0.97,2849.379,2860.257,"It's I would say at this point, it's one element as an element of scale.",51,,
352,0.97,2860.257,2876.173,"And Yeah, if they are developing and a part of the resource mix where a part of an option that is wholly a part of what we would evaluate in making a selection of what that resource would be.",51,,
353,0.97,2876.173,2877.641,Deborah has a comment as well.,51,,
354,0.97,2877.641,2902.065,"I just wanted to add that as Josh indicated in the presentation, we are the renewable plus product that Josh has mentioned was very specific and it was approved by former committee so we would be happy to give you background on that Council member Nelson if you like.",52,,
355,0.97,2902.065,2918.048,That was really around a very specific request from largest companies so we issued an Rfp to see what Pieth be out there to meet their need for Aed Tivety.,52,,
356,0.97,2918.048,2932.863,"So set that aside, we are also going into and we are in the process of completed our integrated resource plan and that's where we'll look more Wholistically at what our projected loads and resource needs are and what that hole might be.",52,,
357,0.97,2932.863,2935.966,Then we look at how we might fill that hole.,52,,
358,0.97,2935.966,2942.873,We know preliminarily that we are going to need new resources in the 2026 time frame.,52,,
359,0.97,2942.873,2952.149,"What that new resource looks like and what that may be, that's part of what we're talking about in the Irp process with a lot of public involvement as well.",52,,
360,0.97,2952.149,2955.919,We talk to the community and find out what folks are interested in.,52,,
361,0.97,2955.919,2962.459,We really want that resource act situation that we do to be consistent with the values of our community.,52,,
362,0.97,2962.459,2968.598,So lots of opportunity for us to talk to you about the Irp as we move through that process over the next year.,52,,
363,0.97,2968.598,2976.807,"And Josh, do you have any sense of when we might first be coming to Council with the update?",52,,
364,0.97,2976.807,2980.143,I don't.,53,,
365,0.97,2980.143,2987.084,I want to say mid to second third quarter I've got August in my head.,53,,
366,0.97,2987.084,2988.919,That's where I think we're at.,53,,
367,0.97,2988.919,2992.756,Council members we'll have lots of chances to talk about that.,53,,
368,0.97,2992.756,3003.5,"Well, council member Straus, I see a bio Digester in this.",54,,
369,0.97,3003.5,3008.138,Taking all the valley district and plugging it into the grid.,54,,
370,0.97,3008.138,3008.905,"Sounds simple, right?",54,,
371,0.97,3008.905,3031.027,"Anyway Council member Nelson I've been involved and spoken with folks at impact about their bio Digester and Michael has some really great ideas and this is another one of the things I would love to see as we reactivate the leery Triangle with food trucks, skate parks, dog parks whatever the community want.",54,,
372,0.97,3031.027,3039.77,This is a great idea how to link that spent yeast in the bow ward brewery district and produce energy.,54,,
373,0.97,3039.77,3043.874,We would love to follow city lights leads.,54,,
374,0.97,3043.874,3047.911,Don't want to Overpower the Substation right there.,54,,
375,0.97,3047.911,3048.178,Right.,55,,
376,0.97,3048.178,3085.882,"All right, so one final comment that I have is Electrify occasion Electrify this is in your report so we have got our electric fleet with the city but more and more people are switching to electric cars so I do know city light has installed electric charging stations in places that might not be served by--that aren't served by the private sector.",56,,
377,0.97,3085.882,3092.155,"But I always wonder if you have one of these, where do you go to plug it in?",56,,
378,0.97,3092.155,3111.341,I will be working on a piece of legislation to enable private electric vehicle charging stations to locate on private property just to expand our network of charging stations across the city.,56,,
379,0.97,3111.341,3114.144,City light can't do it alone.,56,,
380,0.97,3114.144,3114.845,Those are expensive.,56,,
381,0.97,3114.845,3118.949,"Not just to install but to maintain, etc.",56,,
382,0.97,3118.949,3122.285,So just a note on that.,56,,
383,0.97,3122.285,3122.486,Okay.,56,,
384,0.97,3122.486,3123.887,Are there any other comments?,56,,
385,0.97,3123.887,3126.423,"Council member, you would say we do have a small team.",57,,
386,0.97,3126.423,3133.063,"As you begin to think about that before you introduce legislation, we would love to chat with you about it.",57,,
387,0.97,3133.063,3142.472,"We have been really kind of--I think I mentioned this to you, pivoting our strategy exactly the way you're talking about it so.",57,,
388,0.97,3142.472,3148.512,"As the private sector steps up and shows interest, there's a lot of interest in the Seattle area.",57,,
389,0.97,3148.512,3155.819,We have focused effort on making it easy to site private charging infrastructure.,57,,
390,0.97,3155.819,3181.611,In the places where the private sector wants to do that or for the for profit sector and then making our role as we put in publicly charging stations doing that in places that are less attractive to the private sector so we can ensure from an equity perspective that everyone has access to easy charging for their electric vehicles as we continue to move down that path.,57,,
391,0.97,3181.611,3184.948,We made changes on our standards and have done other things.,57,,
392,0.97,3184.948,3200.931,"We have been working with Volkswagon, charge point, Tesla and a variety of private sectors so we would love to chat with you and can get you a briefing with someone who knows more about it than I do which will be good.",57,,
393,0.97,3200.931,3201.264,So thank you.,57,,
394,0.97,3201.264,3202.933,"All right, thank you.",58,,
395,0.97,3203.233,3212.909,"Well, moving on, I moved that the committee recommends adoption of resolution 32040 is there a second?",59,,
396,0.97,3212.909,3213.543,Second.,60,,
397,0.97,3213.543,3222.619,"All right, it's been moved to recommend adoption of resolution any further comments?",61,,
398,0.97,3222.619,3223.687,"Going once, twice all right.",61,,
399,0.97,3223.687,3236.132,Seeing no hands will the clerk call the roll on the committee recommendation that the resolution be adopted.,61,,
400,0.97,3236.132,3237.334,Herbold.,62,,
401,0.97,3237.334,3238.635,Yes.,63,,
402,0.97,3238.635,3239.869,Juarez.,64,,
403,0.97,3239.869,3240.136,Aye.,65,,
404,0.97,3240.136,3241.371,Straus.,66,,
405,0.97,3241.371,3241.605,Yes.,67,,
406,0.97,3241.605,3242.305,"Nelson, aye.",68,,
407,0.97,3242.305,3244.14,Five in favor none opposed.,69,,
408,0.97,3244.14,3255.885,All right the motion carries and the committee recommendation the resolution be adopted will be forwarded to the city council for final consideration.,70,,
409,0.97,3255.885,3256.386,"Okay, well, folks.",70,,
410,0.97,3256.386,3258.288,"Thanks very much, take care.",71,,
411,0.97,3258.288,3260.89,"Yes, we reached the end.",72,,
412,0.97,3260.89,3267.897,And this concludes the January 26th meeting of the economic development technology and city light committee.,72,,
413,0.97,3267.897,3269.432,Thank you all very much.,72,,
414,0.97,3269.733,3276.773,Wait.,73,,
415,0.97,3277.707,3278.208,We're done.,74,,
416,0.97,3278.208,3279.576,Lisa Herbold.,75,,
417,0.97,3279.576,3281.444,The meeting is over.,76,,
418,0.97,3281.444,3282.712,Council member Herbold.,77,,
419,0.97,3282.712,3284.914,Are we still recording?,78,,
420,0.97,3284.914,3285.348,Still recording.,79,,
421,0.97,3285.348,3286.016,Shoubt that.,80,,
422,0.97,3286.016,3288.351,We are still on.,81,,
423,0.97,3288.351,3290.02,Thank you.,82,,
424,0.97,3290.02,3294.691,Madame president for assisting and trying to get the attention.,82,,
425,0.97,3294.691,3300.463,"I'm sorry, but thank you for giving me a moment to say a couple words.",82,,
426,0.97,3300.463,3308.338,It wasn't clear at the top of your introductory remarks if there was an opportunity to sort of Chime in.,82,,
427,0.97,3308.338,3312.742,On the public safety angle.,82,,
428,0.97,3312.742,3314.978,Really appreciate your remarks.,82,,
429,0.97,3314.978,3330.894,And wanted to put a quick plug in for an effort that we just very lightly touched on in the Council briefing session on the state legislative agenda.,82,,
430,0.97,3330.894,3337.567,I think I highlighted bills related to gun violence and catalytic converter theft.,82,,
431,0.97,3337.567,3346.91,We barely touched on another bill that I think the public might would like to know about if they're not already involved in working on.,82,,
432,0.97,3346.91,3359.556,Perhaps that's something that Oir can help us engage with the retail business owners to lift their voices in Olympia.,82,,
433,0.97,3359.556,3373.97,There are two bills to address organized retail theft which is obviously a growing problem not here but in cities across the nation.,82,,
434,0.97,3373.97,3377.407,Organized crime groups are now involved in retail theft.,82,,
435,0.97,3377.407,3384.681,They can very easily and anonymously sell stolen goods Online.,82,,
436,0.97,3384.681,3392.188,These are Online platforms giving Lawbreakers access to shoppers they might not other Wuz reach.,82,,
437,0.97,3392.188,3399.696,And allow them to sell the merchandise directly.,82,,
438,0.97,3399.696,3401.03,There's also E-Fencing.,82,,
439,0.97,3401.03,3416.279,That's when there's somebody Online who BUYS stolen goods on purpose for the purpose of Resaling letter and then there are dedicated Websites that allow customers to exchange stolen goods for cash.,82,,
440,0.97,3416.279,3436.666,All of this Online activity is really driving a lot of the unlawful organized Shoplifting that we're seeing here in Seattle and in cities throughout the country.,82,,
441,0.97,3436.666,3442.605,So House bill 1614 establishes a number of requirements for these Online Marketplaces.,82,,
442,0.97,3442.605,3451.915,And many of the requirements are requirements that thieves do not want to participate in.,82,,
443,0.97,3451.915,3462.325,"If the Online Marketplaces do not comply with the requirements, the individuals cannot participate Online with selling the goods.",82,,
444,0.97,3462.325,3465.328,"So again, that's house bill 1614.",82,,
445,0.97,3465.328,3471.935,"Agree with you, council member Nelson, chair Nelson, this isn't a solution to the problem.",82,,
446,0.97,3471.935,3484.581,But it is one small action that we can work on behalf of our small business owners and major retailers as well that are also suffering.,82,,
447,0.97,3484.581,3494.123,And would love to work with you on perhaps connecting with Oir to maybe create some sort of joint letter or something like that.,82,,
448,0.97,3494.123,3500.129,Thank you very much Council member Herbold.,83,,
449,0.97,3500.129,3511.674,I did hear your comments on the cat Lateralic converter bill and you mentioned something with having to do with copper wire under bridges.,83,,
450,0.97,3511.674,3516.045,In city facilities so I do appreciate your attention to that.,83,,
451,0.97,3516.045,3522.919,And so let's I don't know if Oir is tracking 1614 but we can check back.,83,,
452,0.97,3522.919,3545.174,"Also something I heard about from PCC community markets House bill 1656 which is a bill that would basically enable businesses grocery stores, whatever else to more easily apprehend people that are doing blatant Shoplifting.",83,,
453,0.97,3545.174,3549.712,We heard a story in Seattle times about the downtown target or something.,83,,
454,0.97,3549.712,3552.048,So I appreciate your attention.,83,,
455,0.97,3552.048,3558.288,"It's going to take working together and like I said, hugely complex issue.",83,,
456,0.97,3558.288,3587.183,"And I also want to note, council member Straus is meeting with the restaurant and hospitality sector and people of that sector in district six, I know that you're plugged into what's going on there and I think Council member Peterson is touring actually the U-District to see what the letter brings up so.",83,,
457,0.97,3587.183,3599.462,I think it's positive this is getting attention and I appreciate your grace in hearing me bring it up.,83,,
458,0.97,3599.462,3600.129,So.,83,,
459,0.97,3600.129,3600.863,All right.,83,,
460,0.97,3600.863,3601.164,Anything es?,83,,
461,0.97,3601.164,3601.364,Okay.,83,,
462,0.97,3601.364,3602.599,"This meeting is adjourned, thank you.",83,,
