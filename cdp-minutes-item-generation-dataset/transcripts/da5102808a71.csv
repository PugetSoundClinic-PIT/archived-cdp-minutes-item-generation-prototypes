120,0.97,686.919,690.356,"So, it's great to see this bill pass in this larger form.",24,,
121,0.97,690.356,694.46,Those of the updates in Healthcare if there's any questions.,24,,

126,0.97,718.184,720.986,Because some of the bills have been concurred on and others have not.,26,,
127,0.97,720.986,742.975,"So, as far as concurrence goes, House bill 1220, that was the bill that would require planning for affordable housing and emergency shelter needs, and establishes zoning requirements for permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, emergency shelter, was concurred upon by the house.",26,,
128,0.97,742.975,744.376,"Now, will move to the governor's desk.",26,,

133,0.97,769.735,773.038,We are working very hard to get that bill moving before the end of the session.,26,,

136,0.97,794.36,797.396,"So, we will continue to keep you updated and work on that bill.",26,,
137,0.97,797.396,810.176,"Senate bill 5160, the bill that provides tenant protections following the end of the Eviction moratorium, including right to counsel and a payment plan framework.",26,,
138,0.97,810.176,819.885,"Was amended, as I mentioned, last week to include that the governor may not extend the Eviction moratorium any further.",26,,
139,0.97,819.885,831.897,There is some real concern that there won't be enough time to set up the legal representation aspect of that bill around the state.,26,,
140,0.97,831.897,849.415,"So, advocates are working very hard to make sure that there is some way to extend the Eviction moratorium, or do something to make sure that there is enough time to have those right to counsel set up to avoid sort of a bubble of Evictions before right to counsel gets set up.",26,,
141,0.97,849.415,851.217,We'll also keep you posted there.,26,,
142,0.97,851.217,859.525,"That's what I have on housing, and I'm happy to pause to see if there are any questions on these very important bills.",26,,
143,0.97,859.525,860.326,"Thanks, Robin.",27,,
144,0.97,860.326,862.194,"Any questions or comments on those bills, college?",27,,

147,0.97,866.031,867.032,Councilmember Sawant.,27,,
148,0.97,867.032,869.435,Thank you.,28,,
149,0.97,869.435,875.741,"Robin, you just eluded to this point about the Eviction moratorium.",28,,
150,0.97,875.741,894.927,"As you noted in the final stages of approving the legislation, really terrible of the Democrats in the state house agreed to an amendment to the Senate bill 5160, that requires the governor's Eviction moratorium to end at the end of June.",28,,
151,0.97,894.927,909.074,"This last-minute amendment introduced and voted on in a rash manner late in the evening of April 8, denying community activists the opportunity to weigh in is a shameful betrayal of tenants everywhere.",28,,
152,0.97,909.074,913.746,"Now, tenants are fighting a defensive battle to strip this amendment out before the bill heads to the governor's desk.",28,,
153,0.97,913.746,924.356,Absolutely support any Last- ditch effort that can be made here to remove this sunset clause.,28,,
154,0.97,924.356,935.1,"I just wanted to note for the record that it is just absolutely shameful that the Democrats, including Self- described progressive Democrat have gone on the record calling for an end to the Eviction moratorium.",28,,
155,0.97,935.1,937.77,At a time of such unprecedented crisis.,28,,
156,0.97,937.77,944.009,"We know if this gets signed into law as is, it will be absolutely catastrophic for tenants.",28,,
157,0.97,944.009,946.078,We need a full coverage on right to counsel.,28,,
158,0.97,946.078,956.021,I would just notice the right to counsel passed by the city council is far stronger than the Senate bill.,28,,
159,0.97,956.021,963.729,I think the paramount consideration here is what they have decided to do with the Eviction moratorium.,28,,
160,0.97,963.729,969.101,"So, could you just say a few more words about what are the chances of rolling back this insidious agreement?",28,,
161,0.97,969.101,979.044,"Also, just wanted to let you know in advance, that if there are any efforts that my office can be a part of to help strip this amendment, then please reach out to my staff.",28,,
162,0.97,979.044,983.849,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Sawant.",29,,
163,0.97,983.849,990.556,I'm really not sure exactly what the chances are of something happening to change.,29,,
164,0.97,990.556,1000.332,"I am hopeful that, I know that the Washington low income housing alliance is doing a very big sign on letter.",29,,
165,0.97,1000.332,1005.571,"Just so everyone realizes, that this is a significant issue.",29,,
166,0.97,1005.571,1007.639,That there is quite a concern over.,29,,
167,0.97,1007.639,1014.78,"So, I am very hopeful that some resolution of this will occur in the last days of the legislative session.",29,,
168,0.97,1014.78,1024.857,I will certainly let you know if there is any thing that we can do at the city to try and make sure that that happens.,29,,
169,0.97,1024.857,1027.292,Thank you.,30,,
170,0.97,1027.292,1037.636,"If there are no other questions on housing, then I can move on to police reform, where there are also some exciting developments.",31,,
171,0.97,1037.636,1041.707,"I don't see any other questions, Robin.",32,,
172,0.97,1041.707,1051.517,"So, similarly here, there are some significant statewide policies that have moved to the governor's desk.",33,,
173,0.97,1051.517,1054.52,House bill 1267 on independent investigation.,33,,
174,0.97,1054.52,1058.223,The House concurred with the Senate amendments.,33,,
175,0.97,1058.223,1061.96,That is the bill that would establish the statewide independent investigations of use of excessive force.,33,,
176,0.97,1061.96,1069.334,Which is a very important policy for the impacted families to see.,33,,
177,0.97,1069.334,1071.437,I think it was sort of the Touchtone piece of legislation.,33,,
178,0.97,1071.437,1073.105,It's great to see that move forward.,33,,
179,0.97,1073.105,1086.452,"House bill 1089, that requires Audits of deadly force incidents, and also of law enforcement agencies to ensure compliance with training requirements was also concurred upon by the house and sent to the governor.",33,,
180,0.97,1086.452,1096.562,The same thing with Senate bill 5259 on data collection . The Senate concurred with amendments and sent the bill to the governor's desk.,33,,
181,0.97,1096.562,1112.444,"House bill 1054, on tactics that bans Chokehold, No-Knock warrants, misuse of Teargas, firing on a motor vehicle, and use of military equipment, as well as House bill 1310, on use of force.",33,,
182,0.97,1112.444,1120.586,"In both cases, the House refused to concur with the Senate amendments to those bills, so they have been sent to conference.",33,,
183,0.97,1120.586,1131.897,"I understand that conversations are ongoing, and there is also great hope that the resolution that is amenable to all parties involved will be reached.",33,,
184,0.97,1131.897,1135.167,That those will in fact move forward by the end of this session.,33,,
185,0.97,1135.167,1136.001,On Sunday.,33,,
186,0.97,1136.001,1140.906,"Then, there are two other bills where concurrence has not happened.",33,,
187,0.97,1140.906,1143.108,That are fairly significant police reform bills.,33,,
188,0.97,1143.108,1149.815,"That is Senate bill 5051, Senator Pedersen's oversight and accountability of peace officers bill.",33,,
189,0.97,1149.815,1151.817,Otherwise known as decertification.,33,,
190,0.97,1151.817,1155.521,It is still waiting for House concurrence.,33,,
191,0.97,1155.521,1159.992,"Senate bill 5066, the duty to intervene bill, is similarly waiting for concurrence.",33,,
192,0.97,1159.992,1161.76,"So, that is the update on police reform.",33,,
193,0.97,1161.76,1166.331,I'm happy to take any questions.,33,,
194,0.97,1166.331,1167.499,"Any questions, colleagues?",34,,
195,0.97,1167.499,1168.734,I'm not seeing any hands raised.,34,,
196,0.97,1168.734,1170.402,I think we can continue.,34,,
197,0.97,1170.402,1175.607,"Well, terrific.",35,,
198,0.97,1175.607,1182.514,We will now move on to public safety where there is a significant amount of intrigue that is occurring in the last days with regard to the blight decision.,35,,
199,0.97,1182.514,1200.566,"In the Senate, has striking amendment was advanced that significantly changed the content of Senator Dingess' bill that would have legalized a personal use amount of controlled substances.",35,,
200,0.97,1200.566,1219.484,"Where it ended up was that it would create a situation where the personal use amount language was stripped, and replaced with adding knowingly back into the drug possession laws.",35,,
201,0.97,1219.484,1227.793,"Then, what would happen with prosecution is that the first two cases that were legally sufficient for prosecution would be diverted for the treatment.",35,,
202,0.97,1227.793,1230.262,"Would be diverted to treatment, excuse me.",35,,
203,0.97,1230.262,1238.604,"Then, a third and subsequent violation, it would be up to the Prosecutor to decide when to refer that case.",35,,
204,0.97,1238.604,1250.315,It also includes quite a large study portion to look at things like the availability of treatment and diversion services across the state.,35,,
205,0.97,1250.315,1256.888,"What barriers there are, what the workforce needs are.",35,,
206,0.97,1256.888,1262.127,"Across the state, in terms of people with substance abuse disorder.",35,,
207,0.97,1262.127,1272.738,"What ended up happening was that it required votes, both Republicans and Democrats, to get it out of the Senate.",35,,
208,0.97,1272.738,1278.61,Senator Dingess actually ended up not voting for her own bill.,35,,
209,0.97,1278.61,1281.847,All agreed that they wanted to move the policy forward to continue working on the issue.,35,,
210,0.97,1281.847,1288.92,"On the other side, of the Chamber, the House introduced a bill as well.",35,,
211,0.97,1288.92,1298.93,"Representative Goodman and representative Simmons, that would again establish a personal use amount, very similar to Senator Dingess' bill.",35,,
212,0.97,1298.93,1304.369,"That, make possession of a personal use amount a civil infraction.",35,,
213,0.97,1304.369,1314.78,"Lily also highlighted this in her introductory remarks, but also provides for a study to look at what the landscape of services are available in the community now.",35,,
214,0.97,1314.78,1320.452,"And would provide a grant program that, at this point, seems to be largely unfunded.",35,,
215,0.97,1320.452,1323.889,"I would say with both of these things, we are just keeping an eye out.",35,,
216,0.97,1323.889,1336.702,"The bills that create new Misdemeanors would create additional potentially, additional caseload for municipal courts.",35,,
217,0.97,1336.702,1339.504,"So, we are just watching that to see how things develop.",35,,
218,0.97,1339.504,1341.373,This is very much still a work in progress.,35,,
219,0.97,1341.373,1349.081,It is an extremely complicated policy to try and figure out quickly.,35,,
220,0.97,1349.081,1361.026,At the end of a legislative session when you have so many differing opinions about what the solution should be among a cast of legislators across both the Senate and the house.,35,,
221,0.97,1361.026,1364.429,"So, I will certainly update you on where this all ends up keep you posted.",35,,
222,0.97,1364.429,1372.871,Definitely an important policy that is being decided in these last days of the legislative session.,35,,
223,0.97,1372.871,1376.908,I'm happy to take any questions.,35,,
224,0.97,1376.908,1378.91,That concludes my report for today otherwise.,35,,
225,0.97,1378.91,1382.147,"Thanks, Robin for that.",36,,
226,0.97,1382.147,1386.017,"Colleagues, any comments or questions on that report?",36,,
227,0.97,1386.017,1387.052,Councilmember Herbold.,36,,
228,0.97,1387.052,1390.322,I see your hand is up.,36,,
229,0.97,1390.322,1391.356,"Then, if somebody from I.T.",36,,
230,0.97,1391.356,1396.161,Can reach out to Councilmember Morales.,36,,
231,0.97,1396.161,1398.764,It looks like she is having some technology difficulties.,36,,
232,0.97,1398.764,1399.698,"Councilmember, Herbold.",36,,
233,0.97,1399.698,1403.135,Thank you.,37,,
234,0.97,1403.135,1406.371,I understand that the vote on the House version of the bill is this morning.,37,,
235,0.97,1406.371,1409.174,Is that correct?,37,,
236,0.97,1409.174,1412.878,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",38,,
237,0.97,1412.878,1414.479,I neglected to provide any other procedure update.,38,,
238,0.97,1414.479,1422.587,There is a hearing on the Senate version of the bill in the House Appropriations Committee today.,38,,
239,0.97,1422.587,1425.59,The House bill actually has not been scheduled for a public hearing yet.,38,,
240,0.97,1425.59,1430.695,I suspect that's just because of ongoing negotiations.,38,,
241,0.97,1430.695,1437.068,I think it certainly is an important policy to put out there as part of the overall landscape of what is happening right now.,38,,
242,0.97,1437.068,1451.183,I have a note that there was a--that the hearing is on a variation of the bill in the form of a striking amendment.,39,,
243,0.97,1451.183,1465.03,Which included a bad Republican amendment that apparently passed with only one of our own delegation voting in favor of it.,39,,
244,0.97,1465.03,1466.965,Can you describe what that amendment was?,39,,
245,0.97,1466.965,1475.44,That is essentially the amendment that I was describing that changes --,40,,
246,0.97,1475.44,1476.608,Got it.,41,,
247,0.97,1476.608,1477.843,Yes.,42,,
248,0.97,1477.843,1485.183,I can provide you--the Association of Washington City staff did a little bit of a summary of the amendment.,42,,
249,0.97,1485.183,1487.619,I'm happy to send that to your.,42,,
250,0.97,1487.619,1494.759,I can also send you sort of a line by line quick document comparison where you can see what the amendments did.,42,,
251,0.97,1494.759,1497.762,That would be really helpful.,43,,
252,0.97,1497.762,1519.484,"I'm just wondering as it relates to the House version of the bill, if that is moving forward, what we can do to make sure that the conversations around whatever vehicle passes, is really centered on racial justice and behavior health.",43,,
253,0.97,1519.484,1537.335,Would really like to note there is something that the city of Seattle can do to just really send a strong message that those need to be sort of the centering principles of the legislation in the face of the Blake decision.,43,,
254,0.97,1537.335,1548.313,"We can certainly communicate that to the legislators that we know are involved in the negotiations, Councilmember Herbold.",44,,
255,0.97,1548.313,1552.417,I'm happy to contact them on your behalf and just let them know and make connections for you as well.,44,,
256,0.97,1552.417,1555.82,I know right now of course they are really trying to get this done.,44,,
257,0.97,1555.82,1567.065,"I think it's certainly not too late to say that we are interested in the outcome, and that we really want to be part of the solution, and we want to center racial equity in all of the discussions.",44,,
258,0.97,1567.065,1570.035,Thank you.,45,,
259,0.97,1570.035,1581.079,"I think, unless there are any questions on the intrigue around the Blake decision, I can pass it back to Quinn for the final transportation.",46,,
260,0.97,1581.079,1583.048,Update.,46,,
261,0.97,1583.048,1585.517,"Go ahead, Quinn.",47,,
262,0.97,1585.517,1588.253,I'm going to jump in quickly safely,47,,
263,0.97,1588.253,1591.823,I'm sorry.,48,,
264,0.97,1591.823,1594.059,It's the last weekend I can't get a right.,48,,
265,0.97,1594.059,1594.659,"Apologies, Hannah.",48,,
266,0.97,1594.659,1597.028,No question.,49,,
267,0.97,1597.028,1597.929,No problem.,49,,
268,0.97,1597.929,1599.731,A couple quick updates.,49,,
269,0.97,1599.731,1603.568,Mostly about concurrence.,49,,
270,0.97,1603.568,1606.638,"They concurred on House bill 1297, the working families tax credit.",49,,
271,0.97,1606.638,1608.873,"1140, juvenile access to attorneys.",49,,
272,0.97,1608.873,1616.181,"Paid family leave, and 1399, which reduces barriers for licenses for those with criminal convictions.",49,,
273,0.97,1616.181,1619.851,"So, all those bills now move to the governor's desk.",49,,
274,0.97,1619.851,1623.421,Great news there and those are my updates if there's any questions in this section.,49,,
275,0.97,1623.421,1626.391,I'm not seeing any hands raised.,50,,
276,0.97,1626.391,1629.094,I think we can keep going.,50,,
277,0.97,1629.094,1631.596,"Great, now it is time for Quinn.",51,,
278,0.97,1631.596,1632.464,Transportation.,51,,
279,0.97,1632.464,1635.9,"Thank you, Hannah.",52,,
280,0.97,1635.9,1637.102,Rounding things out in transportation.,52,,
281,0.97,1637.102,1649.514,I would just note that it appears quite unlikely at this point that the Legislature will take action on a potential transportation revenue package this session.,52,,
282,0.97,1649.514,1662.093,"With under a week left, both the house and Senate appear to still be quite far apart in their proposals.",52,,
283,0.97,1662.093,1666.297,The Senate last week advanced their proposal out of committee.,52,,
284,0.97,1666.297,1678.91,"I think Tellingly, despite many overtures made to the ranking member, and sort of the Republican caucus, received no votes.",52,,
285,0.97,1678.91,1683.248,"From Republicans, it was passed on a Partyline vote.",52,,
286,0.97,1683.248,1692.157,That is notable because the bond bill in the transportation revenue package requires a 60% threshold.,52,,
287,0.97,1692.157,1694.759,It is likely that they would need at least a few Republicans.,52,,
288,0.97,1694.759,1700.432,"So, the Senate has advanced the bill out of committee, but it has not gone to the floor yet.",52,,
289,0.97,1700.432,1705.77,The House has neither passed the bill out of committee nor gone to the floor.,52,,
290,0.97,1705.77,1724.055,"Combined with all of the factors, Interconnections with the climate commitment act, which serves as a partial funding source, as well as the low carbons fuel standard, it does appear unlikely they will reach any sort of agreement there were just six days left.",52,,
291,0.97,1724.055,1727.492,"So, that is the transportation update.",52,,
292,0.97,1727.492,1729.294,Happy to take any questions in this space.,52,,
293,0.97,1729.294,1734.199,"Colleagues, any questions?",53,,
294,0.97,1734.199,1738.369,"I am not seeing any hands raised, so I think we can continue.",53,,
295,0.97,1738.369,1741.706,"Thank you, Council President.",54,,
296,0.97,1741.706,1752.917,I would just like to thank you all . This session has been--has presented some pretty incredible challenges for our team.,54,,
297,0.97,1752.917,1756.321,You have just been amazing partners with this office.,54,,
298,0.97,1756.321,1764.496,Every time we have requested--I know you can all chuckle about the late-night calls and weekend calls.,54,,
299,0.97,1764.496,1772.403,We have made to your offices desperately asking for your engagement with specific legislators.,54,,
300,0.97,1772.403,1775.24,You have all bent over backwards to support the work of this Department.,54,,
301,0.97,1775.24,1783.014,We are so grateful to you and just appreciative . It made a challenging session that much better.,54,,
302,0.97,1783.014,1787.852,I know we will have many successes to report during our sign or die report on the 17th.,54,,
303,0.97,1787.852,1793.725,"Lastly, given this is our last legislative report, I'd like to thank our excellent and exhaustive state lobby team.",54,,
304,0.97,1793.725,1794.759,"So, Robin, our deputy director.",54,,
305,0.97,1794.759,1804.869,"Quinn, state relations, and Hannah Smith, government affairs program director for their Mac amazing work this session.",54,,
306,0.97,1804.869,1811.176,"It is quite a sacrifice for them working every single day all holidays, weekends for so long.",54,,
307,0.97,1811.176,1814.846,"We are very lucky to have such smart, creative and Hard- working government affairs professionals here at the city.",54,,
308,0.97,1814.846,1816.881,I cannot adequately express my appreciation for all of them.,54,,
309,0.97,1816.881,1819.083,"So, thank you all so much.",54,,
310,0.97,1819.083,1821.986,"Thank you, Lily, for that.",55,,
311,0.97,1821.986,1833.164,"Colleagues, and any other comments or questions before we say goodbye to members of the Oir team until May?",55,,
312,0.97,1833.164,1845.31,"All right, I'm not seeing any other hands raised I also want to express my appreciation and gratitude to each of you for all of your good work, important work.",55,,
313,0.97,1845.31,1851.382,"Look forward to, I'm sure staying connected between now and may 17th, but otherwise we will see you back your on May 17th.",55,,
314,0.97,1851.382,1851.816,Good luck.,55,,
315,0.97,1851.816,1853.017,Thank you so much.,56,,
316,0.97,1853.017,1855.486,Thank you.,57,,
317,0.97,1855.486,1862.794,"Colleagues, we are going to move into other items of business on the agenda.",58,,
318,0.97,1862.794,1867.232,"Next up is pretty of today's city council actions, Council and regional committees.",58,,
319,0.97,1867.232,1872.937,This week's roll call rotation begins with Councilmember Herbold.,58,,
320,0.97,1872.937,1881.246,"Followed by Councilmember Juarez, Lewis, Morales, Mosqueda, Pedersen, the want, and then I will conclude the is discussion.",58,,
321,0.97,1881.246,1883.648,"First up is Councilmember Herbold, and then Councilmember Juarez.",58,,
322,0.97,1883.648,1884.148,Good morning.,58,,
323,0.97,1884.148,1886.718,Good morning.,59,,
324,0.97,1886.718,1895.059,Starting off items on the full council agenda from the safety and human services committee.,59,,
325,0.97,1895.059,1903.368,We have a few appointments from the city council being the appointed authority to the community police Commission.,59,,
326,0.97,1903.368,1921.486,"Then, when Councilmember Pedersen discusses two of the bills coming from his committee I'll talk a little bit about a couple of amendments coming up on two of his bills.",59,,
327,0.97,1921.486,1929.394,"Also, updates from the human services Department and public health this week.",59,,
328,0.97,1929.394,1942.407,"Wanted to just give the shout out to all the work that human services Department, and their employees are doing to continue to assist the fire Department with Vaccinations at senior housing sites.",59,,
329,0.97,1942.407,1950.715,"This passed week, the human services Department assisted with second those clinics at seven Seattle housing authority buildings.",59,,
330,0.97,1950.715,1959.324,"This coming week, human services Department staff will again be busy with 11 Seattle housing authority buildings scheduled for their second those clinics.",59,,
331,0.97,1959.324,1966.831,The city announced last week that it would stop Covid testing at two sites.,59,,
332,0.97,1966.831,1971.235,"One of those sites being in Rainier Beach, and the other in West Seattle.",59,,
333,0.97,1971.235,1976.741,Saturday was the final day of testing there.,59,,
334,0.97,1976.741,1986.15,"I have advocated with the Mayor's office to keep Covid testing available, especially given the increasing number of Covid cases and hospitalizations over the last few weeks.",59,,
335,0.97,1986.15,1993.958,"Specifically, for West Seattle residents, given the difficulty of leaving the peninsula for Healthcare.",59,,
336,0.97,1993.958,2010.875,"The Mayor's office had previously assured me that if the Southwest site were to stop testing, that they would place a curative testing kiosk in the near vicinity, similar to the one at at don our money.",59,,
337,0.97,2010.875,2029.36,"When I inquired about testing replacement plans on Friday, I was told they are in the process of adding a longer-term, more sustainable, not run by the fire Department, testing capacity in multiple locations through a new provider.",59,,
338,0.97,2029.36,2031.195,They are promising an update in early May.,59,,
339,0.97,2031.195,2033.598,"So, I look forward to that update.",59,,

507,0.97,2984.448,2997.461,"It was really important for us to hear directly from director Hayes, and from our public health officer the importance of Handwashing and so.",65,,
508,0.97,2997.461,3009.172,"Particularly because, as you mentioned, there's an outbreak again of hepatitis A. we have returned to the Pre-Pandemic levels, again, for hepatitis A.",65,,
509,0.97,3009.172,3018.181,"In the same population, we are also experiencing, they are also experiencing 142 cases.",65,,

511,0.97,3024.254,3030.394,"Which, as you may recall, these are illnesses that are transmitted often through fecal matter.",65,,
512,0.97,3030.394,3036.8,"So, Handwashing is really important to prevent these other illnesses from breaking out.",65,,
513,0.97,3036.8,3047.411,"Also, mentioned that we have had an 84%--that 84% of the folks that are experiencing this are in fact homeless.",65,,
514,0.97,3047.411,3051.915,We know how important it is to make sure we are protecting people.,65,,
515,0.97,3051.915,3061.024,"With regard to Covid, the other thing we learned is that we are back above the Covid outbreaks from last summer.",65,,
516,0.97,3061.024,3069.566,"So, we've had fewer hospitalizations in adults due to Covid-19, but the number of hospitalizations in younger adults is actually increasing.",65,,
517,0.97,3069.566,3076.606,"If I'm recalling correctly, we are having one King County resident hospitalized every 45 minutes.",65,,
518,0.97,3076.606,3081.945,"So, it's really challenging right now.",65,,
519,0.97,3081.945,3087.451,"For the general public, we are getting sort of mixed messages that we are moving into phase three.",65,,
520,0.97,3087.451,3090.287,"We are opening up again, and at the same time outbreaks are increasing.",65,,
521,0.97,3090.287,3096.76,"It's really important to wear masks, not hang out with people who don't live in your household.",65,,
522,0.97,3096.76,3100.43,Because we are really closing King County to going back to phase two.,65,,
523,0.97,3100.43,3106.136,We need to all remember to practice good protocol.,65,,

537,0.97,3179.843,3187.551,"We were able to distribute food boxes to almost 1400 households, which is shocking.",65,,
538,0.97,3187.551,3191.254,That was just in about two hours time.,65,,
539,0.97,3191.254,3197.127,There is a lot of meat and we know a lot of food insecurity in the region is still around.,65,,
540,0.97,3197.127,3200.53,I personally spoke to about a dozen families who requested diapers.,65,,
541,0.97,3200.53,3205.635,"On foresight, we did not have any to distribute.",65,,
542,0.97,3205.635,3207.871,Sometimes there is a load that is available.,65,,

546,0.97,3237.767,3250.113,"That legislation, which would close the end of lease termination loophole that exists currently, is one of several pieces of tenant's rights and Eviction defense legislation that my office will be bringing throughout the year.",65,,
547,0.97,3250.113,3255.619,We talked about this several times already in briefing.,65,,
548,0.97,3255.619,3260.49,"In the next few weeks, we will unveil the next piece of legislation that we've been developing with community partners.",65,,

551,0.97,3275.939,3280.41,All of these together will establish a tenant bill of rights.,65,,
552,0.97,3280.41,3296.66,"I just want to say that the state has a stay healthy campaign which represents 42 organizations and thousands of tenants across the city, asked my office to work on all of these policies that can happen.",65,,
553,0.97,3296.66,3299.462,That was back in December.,65,,
554,0.97,3299.462,3307.437,We have been working since then with these advocates and organizations to draft each of these bills since January.,65,,
555,0.97,3307.437,3315.378,"In February and March my office met with central staff and with law, and with others who have been drafting the first two pieces of legislation.",65,,
556,0.97,3315.378,3319.582,We have done all of this alongside community and through Council central staff.,65,,
557,0.97,3319.582,3328.758,This has really been done with community in a very thorough way.,65,,
558,0.97,3328.758,3330.56,Getting regular feedback from folks.,65,,
559,0.97,3330.56,3335.465,This hasn't been in a vacuum.,65,,
560,0.97,3335.465,3341.905,I'm really looking forward to the support of my colleagues as these piece of legislation's come together and come before all of you.,65,,

562,0.97,3342.772,3352.482,Several weeks ago I toured around the I-90 area with Lighthouse for the blind and other pedestrian and bike infrastructure advocates.,65,,
563,0.97,3352.482,3365.995,We walked around--we walked around the area surrounding the coming Jenkins part light rail station.,65,,
564,0.97,3365.995,3367.731,"That is right on the I-90 ramp, or Overpass.",65,,
565,0.97,3367.731,3369.232,Over Ray near.,65,,
566,0.97,3369.232,3375.638,We saw just how scary it is to try to navigate around those ramps if you are a pedestrian.,65,,
567,0.97,3375.638,3381.544,"So, my office has been working with organizations.",65,,
568,0.97,3381.544,3389.185,We have been meeting with state senators and others to try to work on this transportation package.,65,,
569,0.97,3389.185,3398.428,"I'm really frustrated, I can't imagine how Quinn is feeling, that this is a moving the way we had hoped.",65,,
570,0.97,3398.428,3410.974,I am hopeful we will begin to see some serious commitments to pedestrian infrastructure so that we can address this I-90 issue and have some mitigation for the ramps that are really Impeding the safety of folks who are disabled.,65,,
571,0.97,3410.974,3414.144,Folks were trying to move through that intersection in a safe way.,65,,
572,0.97,3414.144,3425.855,"I do want to thank Lakisha Pharma on my staff for convening those discussions with the different transportation organizations, and keeping this issue front and center.",65,,

574,0.97,3432.295,3440.003,"This is an organization that works deeply with young people, particularly at Rainier Beach high school.",65,,
575,0.97,3440.003,3444.908,I have been participating in some capacity in this event for the last several years.,65,,
576,0.97,3444.908,3447.577,It's always fun to spend some time with our young people.,65,,
577,0.97,3447.577,3468.231,My staff member will be leading a workshop entitled Visioning for the future to open up and I League between Rainier Beach students about the changes they want to see in their neighborhood and--I don't have to remind them that they need to be at the Decision- making table.,65,,
578,0.97,3468.231,3470.733,They already know that.,65,,
579,0.97,3470.733,3474.838,This is a chance for us to really engage with them and share some of the work we are doing.,65,,
580,0.97,3474.838,3475.805,Looking forward to that.,65,,
581,0.97,3475.805,3477.64,That is all I have this morning.,65,,

589,0.97,3508.671,3512.575,"I apologize for not being there, but I am watching you all and will provide my report by Audio.",67,,
590,0.97,3512.575,3517.046,I do not have any Audio items on today's full council meeting.,67,,
591,0.97,3517.046,3528.391,I would very much like to bring forward the Seattle housing authority director proclamation that I sent around last Friday.,67,,
592,0.97,3528.391,3534.297,"Colleagues, this would be an opportunity for us to honor the director for his work as executive director from the Seattle housing authority for the passed nine years.",67,,
593,0.97,3534.297,3563.693,"He will be retiring in early May and we hope that with your signature today we can send him off with a proclamation that acknowledges his service in the city of Seattle under multiple mayors and working with various Council . This is really a hard job and I know that a lot has been done to improve both community preference and affirmative marketing under his leadership, and making sure those who are facing a risk of displacement have an opportunity to stay in the city.",67,,
594,0.97,3563.693,3565.628,As we enhance and build additional buildings.,67,,
595,0.97,3565.628,3568.231,More housing.,67,,
596,0.97,3568.231,3576.339,"This will be a chance as well for us to honor him before our Finance and housing committee meeting, which is tomorrow, and will be his last opportunity to present in our committee.",67,,
597,0.97,3576.339,3578.207,The proclamation was circulated last Friday at 12:30 P.M.,67,,
598,0.97,3578.207,3581.044,I hope you will sign on.,67,,
599,0.97,3581.044,3587.317,I will pause here for the appropriate roll call from the Council president and appreciate your consideration.,67,,
600,0.97,3587.317,3592.355,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Mosqueda for those introductory remarks.",68,,
601,0.97,3592.355,3601.364,"Colleagues, as Councilmember Mosqueda just mentioned, there will be a proclamation presented this afternoon at 2:00 P.M.",68,,
602,0.97,3601.364,3609.672,"Before I asked the clerk to call the roll on the signatures to the proclamation, want to offer an opportunity to ask any questions they might have.",68,,
603,0.97,3609.672,3612.875,"Councilmember Sawant, please.",68,,
604,0.97,3612.875,3615.144,Thank you.,69,,
605,0.97,3615.144,3617.981,I have some comments about the proclamation.,69,,
606,0.97,3617.981,3620.049,I will not be signing this proclamation.,69,,
607,0.97,3620.049,3628.358,At this proclamation itself close Andrew Lofton led the nationwide Federal program called moving to work.,69,,
608,0.97,3628.358,3635.264,Moving to work as been a Federal assault on the little remaining affordable housing.,69,,
609,0.97,3635.264,3642.805,The plan was to carry out massive increases in public housing rent with the idea that the tenants would be more motivated to get better paying jobs.,69,,
610,0.97,3642.805,3655.785,"This is Garden-Variety conservative ideology, which claims that people are poor because they are too lazy to seek better paying job, which serves as an excuse.",69,,
611,0.97,3655.785,3660.223,There's also a racial dimension giving that a large proportion of public housing residents are low income families of color.,69,,
612,0.97,3660.223,3662.492,"Many from the immigrant community, and many comprising single mom households.",69,,
613,0.97,3662.492,3669.799,"In an already move, this incarnation was called stepping forward.",69,,
614,0.97,3669.799,3682.545,"If stepping forward have been allowed to succeed, it would have dismantled the Affordability threshold, which is that the rent being no greater than 30% of the tenant and company under stepping forward, rents would be increased by an Eye-Popping 400% over six years.",69,,
615,0.97,3682.545,3695.758,"As a single mother, a tenant in North Seattle at the time told us, when I got that letter, I could barely get out of bed for about a week.",69,,
616,0.97,3695.758,3698.027,Because it almost felt like a death sentence in a way.,69,,
617,0.97,3698.027,3700.43,It felt like we don't have a chance.,69,,
618,0.97,3700.43,3706.269,Rebecca and her fellow tenants understood what is borne out by those statistics.,69,,
619,0.97,3706.269,3712.675,This dramatic rate increase would have meant massive actions.,69,,
620,0.97,3712.675,3715.278,Nearly 9 out of 10 Evictions result in homelessness.,69,,
621,0.97,3715.278,3720.583,"From the moment announced, there was powerful opposition by FHA tenants to stepping forward.",69,,
622,0.97,3720.583,3731.694,"The second FHA public meeting organized by Andrew Lofton and his staff, a Councilmember and I, joined the tenants rally outside.",69,,
623,0.97,3731.694,3743.072,"The tenant unit, and other community organizations also stood with what evolved into a serious community struggle, led mainly by courageous East African single mom tenants.",69,,
624,0.97,3743.072,3747.276,East African leaders.,69,,
625,0.97,3747.276,3748.611,And Socialist alternatives.,69,,
626,0.97,3748.611,3764.427,"Are movement organized hundreds of residents to protest that public meeting after public meeting, ending with an incredible walkout of hundreds from the last public meeting at the high point community center in West Seattle.",69,,
627,0.97,3764.427,3768.498,"Following the walkout, we held a people's Assembly in the basketball court.",69,,
628,0.97,3768.498,3776.639,We built Unstoppable momentum with hundreds of East African and other community members of color who had never before participated in a political movement.,69,,
629,0.97,3776.639,3795.124,"Are movement completely Upended the plans of sha, the Seattle Democratic establishment, and the Obama administration, which was ultimately responsible for the Gutting of public housing funding that was happening at the time.",69,,
630,0.97,3795.124,3799.562,"They organized the public meetings expecting that tenants would be either gullible enough, or not competent enough to post up and forward.",69,,
631,0.97,3799.562,3806.269,"Under pressure from are movement, then Mayor and the Councilmember, were publicly opposing stepping forward.",69,,
632,0.97,3806.269,3812.775,"And a historic victory, sha and Andrew Lofton were forced to refer a stepping forward and allow public housing tenants to stay in their homes.",69,,
633,0.97,3812.775,3819.282,"To my knowledge, Seattle was the only city in which this initiative was defeated.",69,,
634,0.97,3819.282,3829.058,"This was nearly 7 years ago, but I still remember vividly the candor of a Gymnasium full of immigrant tenants chanting stepping backward, and empowered call and response.",69,,
635,0.97,3829.058,3839.602,"As a day and this man said they would--by the King County workforce development Council, which runs the employment assistance program works is.",69,,
636,0.97,3839.602,3846.309,"As one of the tenants reported, work source did not help him learn English or obtain employment.",69,,
637,0.97,3846.309,3856.219,"He challenged publicly saying quote, you say we can all get jobs and afford higher rents, why don't you learn Somali or Chinese in the next year, and then we will believe you.",69,,
638,0.97,3856.219,3860.723,"That got a huge round of applause from the crowd who chanted, where are the jobs?",69,,
639,0.97,3860.723,3862.525,Show me the jobs.,69,,
640,0.97,3862.525,3881.043,"This brutal attack on hot was attempted in 2014, even though a 2013 audit of moving to work by the U.S. Department of housing and urban development own office of Inspector General found that quote, he was unable to demonstrate program results.",69,,
641,0.97,3881.043,3889.952,Also they had limited ability to assess agencies compliance with statutory program goals and lack assurance that agencies met key statutory retirements.,69,,
642,0.97,3889.952,3903.766,"Of course, in the long line of powerful individuals who have carried out such disgusting efforts to get public programs, Andrew Lofton is not at the top of the list.",69,,
643,0.97,3903.766,3911.874,"The capitalist class of Billionaires and millionaires and their political representatives, bear the primary responsibility.",69,,
644,0.97,3911.874,3925.187,"It is their system that is the reason for an acute affordable housing crisis in so many cities, and for the assault on the public resources that were hard won through passed studies led by powerful Labial and social movements.",69,,
645,0.97,3925.187,3928.724,"Stepping forward for example, was justified on the basis of impending $12 million cuts to public housing.",69,,
646,0.97,3928.724,3937.5,Democrat President Barack Obama and both Democrats and Republicans in Washington State and the U.S. Congress there blame for this.,69,,
647,0.97,3937.5,3940.102,"However, Andrew Lofton was not an innocent lower rung employee.",69,,
648,0.97,3940.102,3948.678,He could have used his prominent position to help build a fight to tax the rich and increase funding for affordable housing and reject the cuts.,69,,
649,0.97,3948.678,3955.785,"In fact though, he was the bureaucrat who led the moving to work program nationally and championed stepping forward in Seattle.",69,,
650,0.97,3955.785,3966.462,This is the same logic that led him and the cities Democratic establishment to sell off half of [Indiscernible] in 2012 to raise the funds to renovate the other half.,69,,
651,0.97,3966.462,3991.821,"Again, he and the local Democratic politician should have used their positions to tax further citywide and to demand adequate housing for funding for housing from the Obama administration and from the state Legislature rather than Cheerleading the process of abandoning housing authority land . Lofton seems to be evident from a interview he recently gave to Puget sound business Journal.",69,,
652,0.97,3991.821,3997.026,It is extremely unfortunate that the rest Democrats have brought this Democrat forward.,69,,
653,0.97,3997.026,4010.373,"Instead of monitoring Andrew Lofton, they should be honored during the East African immigrant heroes of that movement that defeated stepping forward.",69,,
654,0.97,4010.373,4012.375,And proud to stand in solidarity with them.,69,,
655,0.97,4012.375,4013.442,Thank you.,69,,
656,0.97,4013.442,4020.983,Thank you.,70,,
657,0.97,4020.983,4026.489,Are there any additional comments or questions?,70,,
658,0.97,4026.489,4028.657,"Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",70,,
659,0.97,4028.657,4036.399,I think it's extremely unfortunate that these comments and concerns raised on Friday.,71,,
660,0.97,4036.399,4039.502,I sent the proclamation to every office on Friday last week.,71,,
661,0.97,4039.502,4042.505,I wasn't here seven years ago.,71,,
662,0.97,4042.505,4053.916,The tenure that I've had with director Lofton over the last four years has allowed for an opportunity for me to see how potentially these policies that you just talked about were championed by community have been stuck to.,71,,
663,0.97,4053.916,4064.226,I am not here to defend any policy that was advanced by a national or local administration.,71,,
664,0.97,4064.226,4070.132,Obviously I think that much of what you just stated regarding the policy are things I object to as well.,71,,
665,0.97,4070.132,4074.236,I absolutely have stood against any sort of requirement to work.,71,,
666,0.97,4074.236,4079.308,I have stood against policies that you describe in stepping forward as unfortunate that I wasn't aware of this history.,71,,
667,0.97,4079.308,4082.344,"For that, I will continue to do some research.",71,,
668,0.97,4082.344,4094.356,"However, I think that it's important to recognize the multiple ways that the 40 year historic low both in terms of Federal funding has contributed to lack of housing in this area.",71,,
669,0.97,4094.356,4096.759,Obviously I don't believe this is on one individual.,71,,
670,0.97,4096.759,4110.973,"I do hope to celebrate I think what has been a tenure that I have seen at least in our Committee, on housing, that has focused on affirmative marketing policies to make sure that 100% of those who wanted to come back were admitted.",71,,
671,0.97,4110.973,4113.175,"Community preference, which has been included in that location as well.",71,,
672,0.97,4113.175,4120.95,"Councilmember Sawant, I think the policy concerns and objections that you raised are things I agree with.",71,,
673,0.97,4120.95,4128.457,I do hope that people will continue to sign onto this proclamation to honor the public service from a public servant.,71,,
674,0.97,4128.457,4130.493,That does not necessarily equal support for those policies.,71,,
675,0.97,4130.493,4151.18,"Obviously my case specifically, does not support for the stepping forward policy, but in the interest of mind, to make sure that at the end of the tenure, that the work to the city and making sure that the policies that community organizations as you noted, had called for, were ultimately implemented.",71,,
676,0.97,4151.18,4156.685,This is part of that effort to recognize that work and I still hope folks will sign on.,71,,
677,0.97,4156.685,4159.321,Councilmember Pedersen.,72,,
678,0.97,4159.321,4161.39,I see that your hand is raised as well.,72,,
679,0.97,4161.39,4169.331,Good morning colleagues and thank you Councilmember Mosqueda for bringing this forward.,73,,
680,0.97,4169.331,4171.767,Thank you Councilmember Sawant for raising the history of the program.,73,,
681,0.97,4171.767,4177.806,I'm still comfortable with this proclamation because the way it talks about that moving work.,73,,
682,0.97,4177.806,4182.444,It is just noting what he is doing.,73,,
683,0.97,4182.444,4185.347,One of the things he is working on now.,73,,
684,0.97,4185.347,4199.728,"I don't think the proclamation needs to go into the details of the first Iteration of that, which did raise questions and people appropriately raised a bunch of questions when it first came out years ago.",73,,
685,0.97,4199.728,4202.431,"So, I'll be supporting this proclamation.",73,,
686,0.97,4202.431,4209.271,I think the theme here is that Andrew Lofton has been a public servant that has served the city and the region for decades.,73,,
687,0.97,4209.271,4217.379,"Is retiring, so it is celebrating the multiple challenging issues that he has worked on in different positions.",73,,
688,0.97,4217.379,4218.781,I'll be supporting the proclamation.,73,,
689,0.97,4218.781,4219.848,Thank you.,73,,
690,0.97,4219.848,4225.688,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",74,,
691,0.97,4225.688,4227.189,For those comments.,74,,
692,0.97,4227.189,4228.057,Councilmember Sawant.,74,,
693,0.97,4228.057,4232.261,Thank you.,75,,
694,0.97,4232.261,4249.311,"I just wanted to clarify that the statements that Andrew Lofton made where he is clearly unrepentant about what he was trying to champion, were made only last--I believe this is a quote from February.",75,,
695,0.97,4249.311,4252.915,"So, it is very recent.",75,,
696,0.97,4252.915,4265.728,"Also, if Councilmembers are uncomfortable about supporting somebody who champions, even though as I said, it's not--he was not an innocent bystander.",75,,
697,0.97,4265.728,4268.197,He champions the program.,75,,
698,0.97,4268.197,4270.265,He was the leader of the moving to work initiative.,75,,
699,0.97,4270.265,4272.234,You can look all of this up.,75,,
700,0.97,4272.234,4277.539,I would support holding the proclamation if you all say that you weren't aware of this.,75,,
701,0.97,4277.539,4279.742,"Then, what is stopping you from holding the proclamation?",75,,
702,0.97,4279.742,4283.245,I think that would be the right thing to do.,75,,
703,0.97,4283.245,4287.85,The right thing to do would be to honor the East African community member tenants that fought against this program.,75,,
704,0.97,4287.85,4290.552,Thank you.,75,,
705,0.97,4290.552,4295.958,"Colleagues, any other comments or questions on this proclamation?",76,,
706,0.97,4295.958,4298.36,Okay.,76,,
707,0.97,4298.36,4301.93,I am not seeing any other hands raised.,76,,
708,0.97,4301.93,4314.877,"So, we are going to go ahead and move forward based on Councilmember Mosqueda's comments that she would like to continue to move forward with the proclamation based on its content.",76,,
709,0.97,4314.877,4322.117,"So, I'm going to ask that the clerk please call the roll to determine which Councilmembers would like their signature affixed to the proclamation honoring Andrew Lofton.",76,,

730,0.97,4364.893,4368.53,I think you might have had some additional portions of your report that you would like to make.,93,,

738,0.97,4400.429,4405.067,We now know that we no longer need to do that so there is real urgency to get these funds out the door.,94,,
739,0.97,4405.067,4409.772,For programs that may be expiring as we work toward finalizing the American recovery plan act bill.,94,,

864,0.97,5240.368,5252.313,"Keeping rates low is important because rates are technically Regressive, with lower income households paying a larger percentage of their household income for utility bills.",96,,

885,0.97,5386.948,5395.957,"Bonds will enable us to fund bigger projects, rather than piece mailing smaller amounts of money over several years.",96,,
886,0.97,5395.957,5408.369,"Yes, the bigger projects would include major repairs to bridges, but the bond dollars can also provide immediate local matching dollars for larger projects.",96,,
887,0.97,5408.369,5414.842,"Fund some of the Capitation priorities called for by the Stakeholder group, such as building the sidewalks faster.",96,,
888,0.97,5414.842,5417.278,And the funding we need for more strategic planning for longer-term investments.,96,,
889,0.97,5417.278,5426.621,"Finally, bonds should protect the funds against attack from those who might seek to overturn these fees needed for our transportation infrastructure.",96,,
890,0.97,5426.621,5433.895,"So, Councilmember Herbold, Lewis, Mosqueda and I have Crafted an amendment that we are circulating this morning.",96,,
891,0.97,5433.895,5449.977,"This amendment would invest the funds this year as suggested by Sdot and the Stakeholder group, but have Sdot return before the fall budget process with a bigger, bolder plan to have the city issued at least $100 million in bonds, supported by the vehicle license fees.",96,,
892,0.97,5449.977,5460.922,"We will discuss this amendment this Wednesday I Committee, and probably wait to vote on the bill until the Committee on Wednesday may 5th.",96,,

923,0.97,5670.531,5682.91,I'm really looking forward to Frontloading and getting a lot of investment out the door earlier and sooner by really Leveraging that vehicle license fee.,98,,
924,0.97,5682.91,5697.358,"To drive this national conversation that we are seeing around green new deal, around massive infrastructure investments, to leverage the investments that we are seeing that could potentially come from the state.",98,,

927,0.97,5714.241,5743.504,"One of the things that keeps me up at night, and think about all of these big investments that are going to be coming to help Seattle with our infrastructure challenges, is making sure that we are in a position to have resources Online, ready to go, so that we can leverage those Cooperations and partnerships across different levels of government to Cobble together the funding packages needed to do big things to repair our infrastructure.",98,,
928,0.97,5743.504,5745.706,To create Union jobs.,98,,

931,0.97,5762.323,5767.428,That is not a bridge that was designed for bike and pedestrian commuting.,98,,
932,0.97,5767.428,5769.73,"In mind, when it was put in.",98,,
933,0.97,5769.73,5778.639,"That was a desperate backlog of making sure that people can walk, can bite, people with mobility challenges can get around the city.",98,,
934,0.97,5778.639,5787.148,In a way where you do not put your life at risk every time you want to go out and commute via a bike ride.,98,,
935,0.97,5787.148,5788.349,These investments will help us do that.,98,,

937,0.97,5793.053,5796.724,I'll have to wait I guess until after may 5th because I'm not on the transportation committee.,98,,

942,0.97,5816.243,5817.845,Please.,99,,
943,0.97,5817.845,5822.283,Thank you so much.,100,,
944,0.97,5822.283,5825.986,I just want to add to the points made by Councilmember Lewis and Councilmember Pedersen.,100,,
945,0.97,5825.986,5829.79,Many thanks to Councilmember Pedersen for bringing this amendment forward.,100,,
946,0.97,5829.79,5838.966,"As the city auditor's report released last summer noted, the inadequacy of maintenance funding for our long-term health of our bridges.",100,,
947,0.97,5838.966,5851.312,Really is critical since we depend on bridges in Seattle with our many waterways and hills.,100,,
948,0.97,5851.312,5856.817,Bringing forward this discussion now is so important for 2 reasons.,100,,
949,0.97,5856.817,5862.723,The first is that the move levy approved by Seattle voters in 2016 runs through 2024.,100,,
950,0.97,5862.723,5870.631,There will not be an opportunity to increase the amount of funding for bridges and a new level for several years.,100,,
951,0.97,5870.631,5876.57,That's one reason why it's really important for the Council to talk about other ways to provide funding for this urgent need.,100,,
952,0.97,5876.57,5891.752,"The other reason why it is so important is since the auditor's report was released, Sdot announced in Mid-November that the estimated cost for retrofitting 16 bridges has increased significantly.",100,,
953,0.97,5891.752,5903.964,This has resulted in Sdot deciding to move forward with just 11 of the 16 bridge seismic improvements included in the move levy.,100,,
954,0.97,5903.964,5907.334,The estimates for the 16 bridges increased from $67 Million- $730 million.,100,,
955,0.97,5907.334,5918.178,"Again, this is another reason why we cannot continue to sort of kick the can down the road on these decisions.",100,,
956,0.97,5918.178,5928.756,"Not just what bridges are critical for our attention, but what funding sources are going to be in order to build back better.",100,,
957,0.97,5928.756,5936.263,I think bonding is a good solution that we should be considering.,100,,
958,0.97,5936.263,5947.608,I also want to just real quickly mentioned the two amendments to the legislation that Councilmember Pedersen is bringing forward today in full council.,100,,
959,0.97,5947.608,5949.343,That came out of his committee last week.,100,,
960,0.97,5949.343,5953.714,I mentioned these earlier as did Councilmember Pedersen.,100,,
961,0.97,5953.714,5959.62,One is an amendment to Council bill 120024.,100,,
962,0.97,5959.62,5973.033,It simply adds a recital to the Council bill recognizing the upcoming transfer of Sbd's 911 dispatch to the new community safety communications center.,100,,
963,0.97,5973.033,5980.507,"Then, when that transfer occurs, we will need to update the surveillance impact report to align with the new organizational structure.",100,,
964,0.97,5980.507,5992.92,"The second amendment, more substantive, and is intended to respond to input that we received from the ACLU.",100,,
965,0.97,5992.92,6003.664,My original amendment related to the holding on of data received from the automated license plate reader technology.,100,,
966,0.97,6003.664,6025.452,The amendment that came out of committee requests the police Department to get back to us on the feasibility of retaining records on Non-Case specific automated license plate reader data for Oh no more than seven days.,100,,
967,0.97,6025.452,6032.493,"After that passed, we heard back from the ACLU saying that the recommendation is for no more than 48 hours.",100,,
968,0.97,6032.493,6039.199,This recommendation is also contained within the Workgroups surveillance impact report.,100,,

1007,0.97,6257.417,6260.22,Imagine trying to focus on your schoolwork while losing your home.,106,,

1023,0.97,6374.334,6390.45,I continue to think that the fact that the children are evicted in one of the richest cities in the richest country in the world is a damning condemnation . at the very least the city has the power to stop Evictions during the school year.,106,,
