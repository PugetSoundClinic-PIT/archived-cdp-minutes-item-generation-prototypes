33,0.97,115.648,119.519,Thank you teen good morning.,22,,
34,0.97,119.519,125.825,We are before you this morning with a state legislative update.,22,,
35,0.97,125.825,130.73,Maybe a little closer then I said to last time to being halfway done.,22,,
36,0.97,130.73,133.233,Almost halfway done with the 2021 virtual session ending on April 25th.,22,,
37,0.97,133.233,139.272,We have passed some major milestones at this time in session.,22,,
38,0.97,139.272,148.181,"In the 105 day session, House of origin, policy committee cut off the deadline for bills to pass out of the committees they are introduced in.",22,,
39,0.97,148.181,160.627,"Today marks the fiscal committee cut off were bills that have a potential budget impact need to get out of appreciations, ways and means, transportation committees etc.",22,,
40,0.97,160.627,164.797,For them to stay alive in the 2021 session.,22,,
41,0.97,164.797,174.974,"Just around the corner we have House of origin for cut off coming up on Tuesday after next, Tesday after next, which is March 9th.",22,,
42,0.97,174.974,186.252,"In the coming weeks before House of origin cut off, we can expect legislators in both chambers working long hours to advance bills on Covid recovery, climate change equity, police accountability and housing.",22,,
43,0.97,186.252,193.693,Thanks to many Councilmembers for their engagement in the Progressiv revenue and housing space recently.,22,,
44,0.97,193.693,197.43,Appreciate a lot of the communications you had with some budget writers.,22,,
45,0.97,197.43,208.041,Notably Senate ways and means approved the new tax on the sales of stocks and bonds and capital gains.,22,,
46,0.97,208.041,213.346,Partners are heralding that as a major step in the long effort to make our tax code less Regressive in Washington state.,22,,
47,0.97,213.346,217.65,Congratulations to all for your efforts there.,22,,
48,0.97,217.65,225.959,I also wanted to thank many of you on Council for your efforts and assistance as we work through some very challenging Dynamics around arbitration reform as it impacts policing here in Seattle.,22,,
49,0.97,225.959,232.665,We are grateful for your leadership there.,22,,
50,0.97,232.665,235.535,We are going to continue to need to work closely with many of you.,22,,
51,0.97,235.535,238.771,"Much appreciation, and I will turn it over to our state relations director, Quinn Majeski.",22,,
52,0.97,238.771,242.842,"Thank you, thanks for having us this morning.",23,,
53,0.97,242.842,252.385,"As Lily mentioned, the big news in the budget and revenue spaces that Senate Democrats unveiled and passed out of committee their capital gains tax proposal.",23,,
54,0.97,252.385,265.365,"To summarize briefly, it is similar in many ways to what we've seen from the governor and the house, although there are some differences.",23,,
55,0.97,265.365,268.001,The Senate's proposal is a 7% tax on capital gains.,23,,
56,0.97,268.001,271.004,"It Exempts anything below 250,000.",23,,
57,0.97,271.004,278.811,I would note that that exemption applies regardless of whether you are a single or joint Filer.,23,,
58,0.97,278.811,282.215,There is not a different rate if you are filing single or jointly.,23,,
59,0.97,282.215,284.817,It also Exempts retirement savings.,23,,
60,0.97,284.817,288.921,All real estate transactions.,23,,
61,0.97,288.921,294.827,It also creates a similar exemption to what the House put forward for a small family owned businesses.,23,,
62,0.97,294.827,299.932,The exemption there is for business sales under $6 million.,23,,
63,0.97,299.932,305.405,As opposed to the House's proposal which is under $10 million.,23,,
64,0.97,305.405,311.244,The Senate's proposal also directs the funds.,23,,
65,0.97,311.244,313.646,Provides specific direction for the revenue that is raised.,23,,
66,0.97,313.646,323.256,350 million must go to the education legacy trust fund account with the intention there of funding early learning and Childcare investments.,23,,
67,0.97,323.256,328.361,"The specific investments are not stipulated, but that is the goal.",23,,
68,0.97,328.361,335.234,The remaining funds would go towards the taxpayer relief account.,23,,
69,0.97,335.234,353.086,"Again, the details are not stipulated within the legislation, but from the hearing, it sounds like the intent is to provide some form of tax relief, either through reductions in more Regressive taxes, or through funding of programs like the working families tax credit.",23,,
70,0.97,353.086,355.688,That is really the only update in the budget and revenue space.,23,,
71,0.97,355.688,359.559,I will pause there for questions.,23,,
72,0.97,359.559,364.497,"Any questions, colleagues?",24,,
73,0.97,364.497,371.804,"Again, as a reminder because we are sharing the screen here, it's hard for me to see everybody's hands physically raised.",24,,
74,0.97,371.804,378.311,"If you do have a question, please use the raised hand feature in zoom if you're able to.",24,,
75,0.97,378.311,379.712,I'm just sort of scanning now.,24,,
76,0.97,379.712,383.95,I don't see anybody raising their hands so we can keep going.,24,,
77,0.97,383.95,389.622,I will handed off to Hannah to cover education.,25,,
78,0.97,389.622,392.125,"Thanks, Karen.",26,,
79,0.97,392.125,405.938,"Council 1121, which grants waivers to the graduation requirements during an emergency has now passed both houses after passing the Senate last week.",26,,
80,0.97,405.938,408.341,The child care licensing fee bill we've been calling closely.,26,,
81,0.97,408.341,416.349,Senate bill 5136 was heard in ways and means but has not been scheduled for any executive action.,26,,
82,0.97,416.349,425.658,"Senate bill 5237, our 1213, which is the big start for kids under this Childcare bill.",26,,
83,0.97,425.658,434.167,That was exec'd out of House Appropriations last week with five Republicans voting in support and the Senate bill was also exec'd last week.,26,,
84,0.97,434.167,437.036,A couple other highlights.,26,,
85,0.97,437.036,444.377,The bills increasing access to the opportunities scholarship and the school board election qualification have both been passed.,26,,
86,0.97,444.377,448.381,Also those are the big highlights for education.,26,,
87,0.97,448.381,452.585,If there's any questions?,26,,
88,0.97,452.585,459.759,"Colleagues, any questions on education?",27,,
89,0.97,459.759,463.329,"Okay, I'm not seeing any questions on that section.",27,,
90,0.97,463.329,469.502,"Hannah, I know that in this morning I had an opportunity to talk to Lily and Robin.",27,,
91,0.97,469.502,477.076,"In my office, raised the issue have some pretty alarming Statistics related to day care closures across the state of Washington.",27,,
92,0.97,477.076,499.532,"So, we would like to get some follow-up on making sure that the bills that are currently being discussed in Olympia are going to be focused on getting many of those day care facilities that have been closed because of Covid back up and running.",27,,
93,0.97,499.532,516.349,I think hearing that upwards of about 17% of day care facilities across the state have now been closed because of Covid is certainly not going to help growing pressures and demands and needs for Childcare services.,27,,
94,0.97,516.349,520.953,I know that has been part of the conversation.,28,,
95,0.97,520.953,528.361,We'll continue to advocate and follow up with you on any details there.,28,,
96,0.97,528.361,531.43,"Great, let's keep going.",29,,
97,0.97,531.43,535.534,Moving onto the environmental space.,30,,
98,0.97,535.534,538.571,A couple key updates here.,30,,
99,0.97,538.571,548.347,Most bills have made it out of--most bills made it out of the policy committees last week and are in good shape for fiscal cut off this week.,30,,
100,0.97,548.347,557.49,"So, I would NOTE just a few companion bills didn't make it past cut off, but that's not surprising.",30,,
101,0.97,557.49,559.692,Companion bills are few and far between this year.,30,,
102,0.97,559.692,565.064,Leadership has really discouraged them so it's not surprising to see them drop away early.,30,,
103,0.97,565.064,570.069,A couple quick updates on House bill 1084.,30,,
104,0.97,570.069,572.905,This is the building Decarbonization legislation.,30,,
105,0.97,572.905,577.576,The policy committee passed out a slim two down version of this legislation.,30,,
106,0.97,577.576,580.212,I just wanted to provide some details there.,30,,
107,0.97,580.212,590.389,The substitute version of 1084 removes the 70% reduction in annual net energy consumption requirements.,30,,
108,0.97,590.389,602.134,It also removes the natural charge--natural gas surcharge that would be applied to natural gas used in buildings.,30,,
109,0.97,602.134,606.205,"It delays the Benchmarking for tier 2 and tier 3 buildings, which are just smaller buildings from 2021 to 2022.",30,,
110,0.97,606.205,615.581,I would note that it keeps several important provisions that our office of Sustainability and environment is interested in.,30,,
111,0.97,615.581,619.652,It includes a residential stretch code.,30,,
112,0.97,619.652,622.888,That could prove really valuable for the city of Seattle and our own local efforts.,30,,
113,0.97,622.888,630.262,It also keeps the heat pump and Electrification incentive program that would be started up out of the Department of Commerce.,30,,
114,0.97,630.262,634.333,That would help mitigate impacts to low income and vulnerable populations.,30,,
115,0.97,634.333,638.537,That bill is up for executive now in committee.,30,,
116,0.97,638.537,640.773,We are hopeful that it will continue to move forward.,30,,
117,0.97,640.773,646.846,The other bill that I want to provide an update on is 5126.,30,,
118,0.97,646.846,652.151,"This is the climate commitment act, also known as Kapp and invest.",30,,
119,0.97,652.151,654.487,This is the governor requests legislation.,30,,
120,0.97,654.487,663.095,One of the main climate bills being applied this year.,30,,
121,0.97,663.095,675.908,"Senator Carlisle has been working pretty extensively since last week to address some of the feedback that was received on the governor's proposal, especially with regards to can burn around environmental justice.",30,,
122,0.97,675.908,678.711,"Late last week, he introduced his substitute.",30,,
123,0.97,678.711,684.216,The summary of the subject it is four pages long so I'm not going to be able to go into a lot of detail.,30,,
124,0.97,684.216,686.419,I did want to highlight a few components.,30,,
125,0.97,686.419,695.795,It requires the Department of Ecology to conduct an environmental justice assessment every two years.,30,,
126,0.97,695.795,701.033,"If the missions are not decreasing, it requires that they adopt more stringent rules and regulations.",30,,
127,0.97,701.033,710.209,Basically that they Tinker with the dials on the cap and invest program to ensure that those targets are being achieved for overburdened populations.,30,,
128,0.97,710.209,722.922,"It requires that at least 35%, with a goal of 40%, of all of the investments from the program are made in marginalized community and front-line communities.",30,,
129,0.97,722.922,727.426,It also adds two tribal members to the advisory committee.,30,,
130,0.97,727.426,750.182,"Finally, it decreases--one of the chief concerns of the environmental justice community was the ability to use offset programs and offset projects to essentially buy their way, allow companies and polluters to buy their way out of making changes in Washington and in local communities.",30,,
131,0.97,750.182,760.192,It reduces the compliance amount that polluters can reach through offsets.,30,,
132,0.97,760.192,769.502,"From 8% to 5%, and first compliance period, and from 6% to 4% in the second compliance period.",30,,
133,0.97,769.502,775.875,"So again, I think there is probably more work to be done on this legislation.",30,,
134,0.97,775.875,780.012,It certainly faces--it is necessary to implement a budget.,30,,
135,0.97,780.012,786.385,"It is not something that is similar to cut off, but it is still in its policy committee.",30,,
136,0.97,786.385,794.927,"It has quite a long way to go, but this is sort of the first step incorporating a lot of the changes and responding to the feedback that the Senate received in committee.",30,,
137,0.97,794.927,799.431,"So, I will pause there for any questions on environmental legislation.",30,,
138,0.97,799.431,806.505,"Colleagues, any questions or comments on this action?",31,,
139,0.97,806.505,809.742,"Okay, I'm not seeing any hands raised, so we can keep going.",31,,
140,0.97,809.742,812.745,"Thank you, Quinn.",31,,
141,0.97,812.745,815.014,"All right, moving onto general government.",32,,
142,0.97,815.014,819.318,A few updates on bills that didn't cut off.,32,,
143,0.97,819.318,827.426,"First, House bill 1058, technically has until today to make it out of fiscal cut off, but it is not scheduled for a vote, so it will not be moving forward.",32,,
144,0.97,827.426,838.437,This would modify the provisions around the sales tax for arts and cultural programs allowing authority in making changes.,32,,
145,0.97,838.437,840.372,That bill is not moving forward this year.,32,,
146,0.97,840.372,850.983,"Companion legislation for 1264, equity impact statements, did not move forward but the House version is still alive and well and continues to move forward.",32,,
147,0.97,850.983,861.961,"I mentioned this, I believe last week, but a bad bill we were tracking and working to prevent that would preempt a lot of city's authority around the permitting of telecommunications.",32,,
148,0.97,861.961,863.796,5110 also did not move forward.,32,,
149,0.97,863.796,870.703,"Finally, Oh, sorry, that's in a different section actually.",32,,
150,0.97,870.703,872.905,That's it for general government for me.,32,,
151,0.97,872.905,874.84,I would be happy to answer any questions.,32,,
152,0.97,874.84,876.775,"Thanks, Quinn.",33,,
153,0.97,876.775,878.777,Lots of information here.,33,,
154,0.97,878.777,885.117,"Okay colleagues, any comments or questions on this section?",33,,
155,0.97,885.117,892.324,"Not seeing any hands raised, so we can continue through the presentation.",33,,
156,0.97,892.324,895.027,I'll handed off to Hannah on Healthcare.,34,,
157,0.97,895.027,897.229,Thanks.,35,,
158,0.97,897.229,906.839,"In Healthcare, House bill 1477, which is the National 988 emergency Hotline continues to move forward.",35,,
159,0.97,906.839,911.343,The substitute was exec'd out of House Finance last week.,35,,
160,0.97,911.343,918.651,"Representative or wall has been working with Stakeholders to refine the bill and address some concerns over the implementation, Timeline, and cost.",35,,
161,0.97,918.651,925.324,The bill has been referred to appropriations where it is anticipated that it would be trimmed pretty significantly.,35,,
162,0.97,925.324,932.631,"Senate bill 5068, which is the Postpartum Medicaid bill.",35,,
163,0.97,932.631,939.171,It has been voted out of ways and means and there is good momentum for the policy this year.,35,,
164,0.97,939.171,944.243,Looks like the fiscal impacts will not be as significant as thought.,35,,
165,0.97,944.243,948.681,"That is good news, especially since that is a bill that was vetoed toward the end of session last year.",35,,
166,0.97,948.681,952.584,A few bills did not move forward.,35,,
167,0.97,952.584,975.908,"The products sold 221+, which is our regulation on tobacco and Vaping products, and--House bill 1191, which extended health care coverage to some Undocumented immigrants creating a parallel system to Applecare did not move forward this year.",35,,
168,0.97,975.908,980.179,Those are my big highlights in Healthcare.,35,,
169,0.97,980.179,984.216,"Any comments or questions, colleagues?",36,,
170,0.97,984.216,987.419,"Okay, looks like there are none, so we can continue.",36,,
171,0.97,987.419,992.124,"Thank you very much, Hannah.",37,,
172,0.97,992.124,998.43,I just wanted to highlight a little bit of bulletin information.,37,,
173,0.97,998.43,1003.335,You'll notice that you will see some Strikethrough's on some of the bills.,37,,
174,0.97,1003.335,1011.643,"We just wanted to make sure that we indicated the first week after a bill appeared to no longer be moving forward, so we crossed those bills out.",37,,
175,0.97,1011.643,1024.857,"In order to keep this document under control, bills that have died, we will remove from the bulletin for future versions of it.",37,,
176,0.97,1024.857,1027.926,Therefore making it hopefully a little it easier for us to all keep track of.,37,,
177,0.97,1027.926,1029.962,"So, I just wanted to highlight that for everyone.",37,,
178,0.97,1029.962,1042.975,"As far as housing goes, there is a little bit of a low in the Legislature right now where we are waiting for bills to move to the floor, for floor action to be taken.",37,,
179,0.97,1042.975,1050.649,"One update is that the Senate bill 5160, executive action was taken in the ways and Means Committee on Friday.",37,,
180,0.97,1050.649,1054.686,So now the bill will be waiting for a vote in the Senate.,37,,
181,0.97,1054.686,1072.004,"There were some changes made to the bill, however I will say, this is the bill, excuse me, that puts some parameters on how we will proceed with tenant protections after the end of the Eviction moratorium.",37,,
182,0.97,1072.004,1077.876,"Some changes were made to the bill, but this is very much a work in progress.",37,,
183,0.97,1077.876,1080.212,I think they are still no Glaciations going on.,37,,
184,0.97,1080.212,1088.02,This suddenly shouldn't be viewed as the final word on where these tenant protections will land.,37,,
185,0.97,1088.02,1093.125,There are just cause provisions of the bill that were removed.,37,,
186,0.97,1093.125,1097.93,The just cause Eviction bill is to moving forward.,37,,
187,0.97,1097.93,1105.104,"1236, there is a possibility for that to be taken care of in another way still.",37,,
188,0.97,1105.104,1107.139,We do have justice cause provisions at the local level.,37,,
189,0.97,1107.139,1123.155,The landlord also must offer a reasonable schedule for payment of unpaid rent and there was a Qualifier put in that may not exceed monthly payments equal to 1/3 of monthly rental charges.,37,,
190,0.97,1123.155,1126.425,That limits how much a landlord could charge in any payment plan that is agreed to.,37,,
191,0.97,1126.425,1128.46,I think that's all I have for housing this week.,37,,
192,0.97,1128.46,1131.063,Are there any questions?,37,,
193,0.97,1131.063,1138.17,"Colleagues, any questions on this section?",38,,
194,0.97,1138.17,1141.039,"I'm not seeing any hands raised, so we can keep going.",38,,
195,0.97,1141.039,1144.276,"Wonderful, moving onto police reform.",39,,
196,0.97,1144.276,1148.78,"Again here, many bills waiting for action on either the house or Senate floor.",39,,
197,0.97,1148.78,1155.053,There are still a lot of police reform bills moving forward.,39,,
198,0.97,1155.053,1160.759,Certainly indicating the importance that the Legislature is putting on this topic this year.,39,,
199,0.97,1160.759,1167.065,There is still at least a dozen bills that would make fairly significant changes to state law in this area.,39,,
200,0.97,1167.065,1171.703,"House bill 1203, community oversight of law enforcement.",39,,
201,0.97,1171.703,1177.409,That bill was moved out of the House Appropriations Committee last week.,39,,
202,0.97,1177.409,1188.62,There is still work being done on the bill and we are working to make sure that it is aligned with our oversight in Seattle.,39,,
203,0.97,1188.62,1191.623,I know I mentioned that a few times on Monday mornings.,39,,
204,0.97,1191.623,1197.93,House bill 1267 the governor's request for independent investigations.,39,,
205,0.97,1197.93,1199.932,Executive action was taken last week.,39,,
206,0.97,1199.932,1201.633,That bill is still moving ahead.,39,,
207,0.97,1201.633,1208.707,"House bill 1310, use of force, it had executive action taken on it last week.",39,,
208,0.97,1208.707,1212.344,It is also moving forward.,39,,
209,0.97,1212.344,1216.014,Pretty good shape on all these police reform bills.,39,,
210,0.97,1216.014,1218.016,"Otherwise, I don't have any more updates for this week.",39,,
211,0.97,1218.016,1221.82,I'd be happy to take questions.,39,,
212,0.97,1221.82,1228.36,"Colleagues, any questions on this section?",40,,
213,0.97,1228.36,1229.561,"Okay, I'm not seeing any.",40,,
214,0.97,1229.561,1239.905,We can keep going.,40,,
215,0.97,1240.806,1244.776,Looks like there is no questions.,41,,
216,0.97,1244.776,1246.278,Apologies.,42,,
217,0.97,1246.278,1253.585,I actually don't have any update from the public safety field this week so we can move along with the briefing.,42,,
218,0.97,1253.585,1256.421,I have to say I must be a little sleepy this Monday morning.,42,,
219,0.97,1256.421,1257.389,That's all right.,43,,
220,0.97,1257.389,1262.494,"I'm using new Headphones, so I thought maybe I was talking to myself for a moment.",43,,
221,0.97,1262.494,1265.564,All right.,43,,
222,0.97,1265.564,1270.002,I will hand it back over to Hannah for an update.,44,,
223,0.97,1270.002,1272.871,Jumping into safety net.,45,,
224,0.97,1272.871,1282.614,"House bill 1073, which is representative Barry's paid family leave coverages scheduled for executive action today in appropriations.",45,,

228,0.97,1303.235,1304.936,Sorry.,45,,
229,0.97,1304.936,1307.039,As I catch up to myself.,45,,
230,0.97,1307.039,1323.055,"Senate bill 5284, which is the sub minimum wage bill, Tibbetts the Washington Department of labor and industries from injuring sub minimum wage certificates after July, 2023.",45,,
231,0.97,1323.055,1325.724,It passed the House 42-7 last week.,45,,
232,0.97,1325.724,1327.926,That is the end of my update on safety net.,45,,
233,0.97,1327.926,1329.461,All right.,46,,
234,0.97,1329.461,1331.363,Any questions?,46,,
235,0.97,1331.363,1333.365,I'm not seeing any questions.,46,,

237,0.97,1339.071,1341.74,Rounding things out with transportation.,47,,
238,0.97,1341.74,1344.376,Not a whole lot to report here.,47,,
239,0.97,1344.376,1348.68,All three bills have made it out of committee and are now in rules in anticipation of floor action.,47,,
240,0.97,1348.68,1352.484,They have all passed the policy and fiscal cutoff.,47,,
241,0.97,1352.484,1357.789,They will continue to work on them as the session proceeds.,47,,
242,0.97,1357.789,1359.791,Happy to answer any questions.,47,,
243,0.97,1359.791,1366.565,"Colleagues, any questions, comments, things to flag in the area of transportation?",48,,
244,0.97,1366.565,1369.968,I am not seeing any hands raised.,48,,
245,0.97,1369.968,1372.437,"I think that brings us to the conclusion of the presentation, yes?",48,,
246,0.97,1372.437,1373.004,It does.,49,,
247,0.97,1373.004,1375.674,All right.,50,,
248,0.97,1375.674,1387.018,"Lily or Robin, or anyone else, anything else you would like to add as we bring this portion of the presentation to conclusion?",50,,
249,0.97,1387.018,1393.325,"No, thank you so much for your time today and for all the assistance from many of you who are engaging throughout the last few weeks.",51,,
250,0.97,1393.325,1395.994,We very much appreciate your time and energy.,51,,

253,0.97,1399.831,1403.502,Really appreciate your time and effort.,51,,
254,0.97,1403.502,1409.341,"I know there are still some ways to go, but we are happy that you could be with us this morning.",51,,
255,0.97,1409.341,1420.152,Looks like Councilmember Mosqueda has a burning question or perhaps a comment that you would like to make before I say goodbye.,51,,
256,0.97,1420.152,1422.954,"Go ahead, Councilmember, Mosqueda.",51,,
257,0.97,1422.954,1426.458,"Thank you very much, and good morning everyone.",52,,
258,0.97,1426.458,1430.529,I wanted to just take a quick second to thank the members of the office of Intergovernmental relations team.,52,,
259,0.97,1430.529,1445.877,They have been working with us as we respond to questions and concerns from members of the labor community who were pretty appalled that the Association of Washington cities signed in on House bill 1076.,52,,
260,0.97,1445.877,1456.488,"This is the worker protection act which is largely being lifted up by Washington state label Council, and other affiliates that are part of the label Council.",52,,
261,0.97,1456.488,1460.358,We as a city have also been supportive of this piece of legislation.,52,,
262,0.97,1460.358,1469.701,This allows Whistleblowers to bring actions on behalf of the state for violations of workplace protection.,52,,
263,0.97,1469.701,1471.736,This is a critical workplace protection piece of legislation.,52,,
264,0.97,1471.736,1475.04,I just didn't want there to be any confusion to the viewing public about where Seattle stands.,52,,
265,0.97,1475.04,1484.216,"This is absolutely a piece of legislation that is critical, especially in the wake of Covid, and it really is a treacherous situation where so many workers are in precarious situations.",52,,
266,0.97,1484.216,1485.784,They will be looking for work.,52,,
267,0.97,1485.784,1491.223,They will be in desperate need for salaries and pay.,52,,
268,0.97,1491.223,1507.839,"We don't want anyone to further experience any type of labor violations that would prevent them from coming forward, especially in the wake of Covid.",52,,
269,0.97,1507.839,1521.519,"It is critical that we rebuild our local economy in a way that works for working families, especially our lowest wage workers and workers are more likely to experience discrimination including workers of color, the Lgbt community, and so again, House bill 1076 is something the city of Seattle is strongly supportive of.",52,,
270,0.97,1521.519,1545.477,"It was pretty shocking to me, and I know my colleague as well, on the board, to find out that there was a sign in of con, does not represent our position and I appreciate how quickly our members of the Intergovernmental relations team have been working to clarify Seattle's position and seek corrections and how Awc represents their affiliates.",52,,
271,0.97,1545.477,1548.88,This is something that has come up over the years.,52,,
272,0.97,1548.88,1552.35,The Council President is familiar with this from three years ago.,52,,
273,0.97,1552.35,1558.69,There was an issue I was working on two years ago related to Scooters and access to mobility actions.,52,,
274,0.97,1558.69,1559.691,"Now, I get this.",52,,
275,0.97,1559.691,1567.399,"I'm disappointed, but I also want to make sure I'm clear with members of the public that we are very supportive of 1076 and hope for its continued project.",52,,
276,0.97,1567.399,1571.87,Thank you again for your leadership in helping to clarify that.,52,,
277,0.97,1571.87,1573.905,Not a problem.,53,,
278,0.97,1573.905,1582.013,"I just want to say to the team, I know Robin, Quinn, and Hannah have been doing a lot of work with their contacts within Awc.",53,,
279,0.97,1582.013,1585.483,You guys have seen dropped communications in your Inboxes.,53,,
280,0.97,1585.483,1587.719,Continue to let us know how we can be helpful there.,53,,
281,0.97,1587.719,1590.188,We will continue to follow up.,53,,
282,0.97,1590.188,1593.391,"Some good news, the bill is in appropriations today.",53,,
283,0.97,1593.391,1595.293,"As I understand it, the chair is supportive.",53,,
284,0.97,1595.293,1600.699,I think that is helpful.,53,,
285,0.97,1600.699,1608.34,"Thanks for lifting up that issue, Councilmember Mosqueda.",54,,
286,0.97,1608.34,1612.944,Really appreciate your service and the service of Councilmember Strauss on the board of Awc.,54,,
287,0.97,1612.944,1622.654,I know it's a lot of hard work and a lot of important issues that go through that particular organization.,54,,
288,0.97,1622.654,1632.364,Really appreciate the opportunity to sort of Highligt instances in which we may not be aligned with their legislative efforts.,54,,
289,0.97,1632.364,1635.033,"So, appreciate that.",54,,
290,0.97,1635.033,1638.036,"Colleagues, any other comments or questions?",54,,
291,0.97,1638.036,1642.974,"Hearing none, we're going to go ahead and wrap out this section.",54,,
292,0.97,1642.974,1645.377,Thank you to our team members for being with us.,54,,
293,0.97,1645.377,1647.779,We will see you next week.,54,,
294,0.97,1647.779,1653.551,"Until then, thank you and take care.",54,,
295,0.97,1653.551,1660.425,"Okay folks, let's go ahead and move to the next agenda item, 4.",54,,
296,0.97,1660.425,1666.364,It is a preview of today's city council actions.,55,,
297,0.97,1666.364,1672.604,I'll again call on Councilmembers as established by the rotated roll call for city council meetings.,55,,
298,0.97,1672.604,1685.617,"We will start with Councilmember Sawant, followed by Strauss, Herbold, Juarez, Lewis, Morales, Mosqueda, Pedersen, and then I will conclude this agenda discussion.",55,,
299,0.97,1685.617,1689.621,"So, first up is Councilmember Sawant, and then we will hear from Strauss.",55,,
300,0.97,1689.621,1690.288,Good morning.,55,,
301,0.97,1690.288,1693.725,Good morning.,56,,
302,0.97,1693.725,1695.326,"Thank you, Council President Gonzalez.",56,,
303,0.97,1695.326,1703.701,On today's city council agenda there are no items from the Sustainability and Renters rights committee.,56,,
304,0.97,1703.701,1708.74,"The next meeting, which is normally scheduled for tomorrow, has been rescheduled for March 4TH.",56,,
305,0.97,1708.74,1712.243,I informed the Council at our last briefing.,56,,
306,0.97,1712.243,1714.245,Tha will be at 9:30 A.M.,56,,
307,0.97,1714.245,1717.515,That is Thursday of next week.,56,,
308,0.97,1717.515,1719.951,I appreciate committee members working with my office on that rescheduling.,56,,
309,0.97,1719.951,1733.765,My office has sent the legislation to the Council President's office for a production last week for the right to Council for Renters when they face Eviction.,56,,
310,0.97,1733.765,1741.84,I expect that we will be discussing this in the committee next week and it has been--at our next committee meeting on Thursday.,56,,
311,0.97,1741.84,1743.274,Next week.,56,,
312,0.97,1743.274,1747.779,I expect that it will be on next Monday's referral calendar.,56,,
313,0.97,1747.779,1756.087,We will also further discuss the problem that I mentioned before in our fast briefings of default Eviction.,56,,
314,0.97,1756.087,1765.063,"Renters who do not respond to the necessary paperwork or are not present, for their Eviction hearing are effected by default.",56,,
315,0.97,1765.063,1772.103,We have learned from statistical information that this is unfortunately one of the most common outcomes.,56,,
316,0.97,1772.103,1777.008,We know that half the Evictions might be related to default Evictions.,56,,
317,0.97,1777.008,1782.714,The committee will also vote on four Reappointments to the Seattle Renters Commission.,56,,
318,0.97,1782.714,1788.82,My office is also preparing to begin appointments to the green new deal oversight board.,56,,
319,0.97,1788.82,1797.128,"As some of you may know, the Council and the Mayor each appoint eight positions, and then three will be appointed by the board itself.",56,,
320,0.97,1797.128,1801.833,"We have received excellent applications already, which we are reviewing.",56,,
321,0.97,1801.833,1808.74,"Members of the public have not applied, if they would like to, they can find an application form on my Council office Blog.",56,,
322,0.97,1808.74,1811.543,I want to say a few words of solidarity.,56,,
323,0.97,1811.543,1826.157,"The millions of working people in Texas who are reeling from the energy disaster, and also because of Texas energy nightmare is a warning sign of what could happen nationwide unless working people actively begin to fight for a different kind of society.",56,,
324,0.97,1826.157,1846.377,"The profit motive and gap in the system has failed to address the climate disaster, and on top of that, has created an absolutely chaotic infrastructure situation which is now resulting in crisis and collapse for most of us while profits are maximized for a few.",56,,
325,0.97,1846.377,1867.198,"Like Enron, for profit energy companies use all kinds of deregulation and accounting fraud, gaming methods, and in addition to all of that, there has been a new mechanism in the deregulation which is called the energy imbalance market.",56,,
326,0.97,1867.198,1882.614,"Electricity gets traded like stocks and bonds, but not only that, there is a perpetual option mechanism, which is really good for maximizing profits, but absolutely disastrous for providing energy to ordinary people.",56,,
327,0.97,1882.614,1885.917,To tens of millions of customers.,56,,
328,0.97,1885.917,1895.627,"On top of that, completely incapable of dealing with surge demands that are more and more likely to occur because of the climate disaster itself.",56,,
329,0.97,1895.627,1909.841,"I'm sad to say my office has, when we were chairing the Seattle city council's energy committee really push back on this energy imbalance market idea.",56,,
330,0.97,1909.841,1913.411,"That's part of the picture, obviously it's not the only reason why this disaster is happening.",56,,
331,0.97,1913.411,1916.748,We are seeing the overall disaster that happens to deregulation.,56,,
332,0.97,1916.748,1919.417,It is not just Texas.,56,,
333,0.97,1919.417,1921.653,We've already seen this last summer in California.,56,,
334,0.97,1921.653,1925.256,We are going to see this again and again.,56,,
335,0.97,1925.256,1946.678,"After having subjected millions of ordinary people to the misery of days of Brownouts, freezing temperatures, human misery and even death, the millionaire and billionaire Shell holders of the big energy companies are Shameless enough to demand working people must pay massive electricity bills of thousands, and in some cases tens of thousands of dollars.",56,,
336,0.97,1946.678,1954.152,This totally Avoidable tragedy demonstrates that electric power is too important to leave to the market.,56,,
337,0.97,1954.152,1963.695,"We need a democratically planned economy, a Socialist economy as a whole, it is not just infrastructure, it is food, it is Healthcare.",56,,
338,0.97,1963.695,1967.565,It is every other major aspect of our economy.,56,,
339,0.97,1967.565,1974.872,The New York Times published a very important article 2 days ago titled Texas blackouts .2 coast-to-coast crises waiting to happen.,56,,
340,0.97,1974.872,1976.874,I strongly recommend that working people read this article.,56,,
341,0.97,1976.874,1980.345,"The article says quote, I'll just quote a few sentences.",56,,
342,0.97,1980.345,1998.229,"It says quote, the crisis carries a profound warning . As climate change brings more frequent and intense storms, floods, heat waves, Wildfires, and other extreme events, it is placing growing stress on the foundations of the country's economy.",56,,
343,0.97,1998.229,2006.337,"Its network of roads and railways, drinking water systems, power plants, electrical Grids, industrial waste sites, and even homes.",56,,
344,0.97,2006.337,2014.278,Failures in just one sector can set off a domino effect of breakdowns and hard to predict ways.,56,,
345,0.97,2014.278,2025.39,"Much of this infrastructure was built decades ago under the expectation that the environment around it would remain stable, or at least fluctuate with them for Datable bounds.",56,,
346,0.97,2025.39,2027.458,"Now, climate change is Upending that assumption, end quote.",56,,
347,0.97,2027.458,2037.435,"In other words, in the entire article, the situation the author describes is so dire that the article is actually making an argument for a democratically planned economy.",56,,
348,0.97,2037.435,2041.672,Obviously that is not the intention of the author.,56,,
349,0.97,2041.672,2064.462,"It's very important for working people and the labor movement and the climate justice movement to have a sober assessment of how dire the situation is and how urgent things are that we make this--make a real shift away--not only away from fossil fuels, but towards democratically owned corporations, especially in the energy and infrastructure sector.",56,,
350,0.97,2064.462,2068.499,I'll also say this is in reference to my earlier point.,56,,
351,0.97,2068.499,2076.874,Councilmembers may remember a couple years ago Seattle city light enter the California energy imbalance market.,56,,
352,0.97,2076.874,2079.41,Something that my office is imposed ..,56,,
353,0.97,2079.41,2089.02,"In 2016, when the executive first proposed education entering the market, that's when it came to the Council committee that I chaired.",56,,
354,0.97,2089.02,2095.827,We amended the bill requiring city light to propose on far more current proposal before Council approval.,56,,
355,0.97,2095.827,2104.235,"The following year, in 2017, city light made its full proposal in my committee.",56,,
356,0.97,2104.235,2109.54,I was not convinced and proposed a budget amendment removing the funding for the infrastructure necessary to enter the market.,56,,
357,0.97,2109.54,2114.612,"Unfortunately, only current Council President Gonzalez agreed to cosponsor that budget amendment with me.",56,,
358,0.97,2114.612,2118.449,"So, it failed.",56,,
359,0.97,2118.449,2120.151,City light has now entered the energy imbalance market.,56,,
360,0.97,2120.151,2121.719,You see the irony.,56,,
361,0.97,2121.719,2132.23,"It is a publicly owned utility, but overall the imbalance market itself is highly deregulated and as I said, it's a perpetual auction market.",56,,
362,0.97,2132.23,2143.875,"Because city light is a publicly owned utility, we are somewhat safer from the kind of Brownouts and shocking electric ills that private [Indiscernible] have inflicted on their customers in Texas.",56,,
363,0.97,2143.875,2154.785,"Nonetheless, these events should be a warning for all of us the misery that can be created when energy is created like a profitable commodity rather than a human need.",56,,
364,0.97,2154.785,2167.198,"Most immediately, we need to unite with working people in Texas and demand that they get immediate emergency funding for working people in Texas.",56,,
365,0.97,2167.198,2173.504,"Paid for by the For-Profit utility corporations that created this crisis, canceling all utility bills for working people and struggling small businesses.",56,,
366,0.97,2173.504,2178.376,They are taking these For-Profit companies into Democratic public ownership.,56,,
367,0.97,2178.376,2182.68,Just making it like city light.,56,,
368,0.97,2182.68,2188.92,Really there should be criminal charges against the energy executives who have caused untold misery.,56,,
369,0.97,2188.92,2190.721,Ted Cruz must design.,56,,
370,0.97,2190.721,2193.991,Thank you.,56,,
371,0.97,2193.991,2197.895,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,57,,
372,0.97,2197.895,2201.132,Any comments or questions on that report?,57,,
373,0.97,2201.132,2204.335,All right.,57,,
374,0.97,2204.335,2208.239,"Hearing none, we are going to go ahead and continue going down the line.",57,,
375,0.97,2208.239,2210.007,Next up is Councilmember Strauss.,57,,
376,0.97,2210.007,2212.51,Good morning.,57,,
377,0.97,2212.51,2217.615,"Good morning, Council President, colleagues.",58,,
378,0.97,2217.615,2222.52,There is one item from the land use a neighborhoods Committee on today's introduction and referral calendar.,58,,
379,0.97,2222.52,2227.925,"Bringing business home, a small business flexibility bill brought forward to you by by myself and Council President Gonzalez.",58,,
380,0.97,2227.925,2239.537,Councilmember 120001 modifies for Home-Based businesses for one year to provide flexibility to small and Micro business owners who are struggling to stay open during the pandemic.,58,,
381,0.97,2239.537,2249.88,"As witnesses have been forced to find creative and nimble ways to survive, our Land-Use code has not kept up and too often has held them back.",58,,
382,0.97,2249.88,2250.681,This legislation fixes that.,58,,
383,0.97,2250.681,2255.987,I'm excited to be introducing this legislation today again with Council President Gonzalez.,58,,
384,0.97,2255.987,2258.255,One example of the impact this legislation would have.,58,,
385,0.97,2258.255,2267.365,You may have heard about yonder cider in Greenwood which opened last summer and has served cider to go out of their garage.,58,,
386,0.97,2267.365,2275.706,Yonder had to shut down a week ago today because it was found to be out of compliance with our outdated home occupation rules.,58,,
387,0.97,2275.706,2279.577,It's not just about yonder.,58,,
388,0.97,2279.577,2282.48,"Going around, walking around the neighborhood, I have seen Pizza shops.",58,,
389,0.97,2282.48,2283.981,Therapists.,58,,
390,0.97,2283.981,2287.918,Licensed massage therapist.,58,,
391,0.97,2287.918,2290.921,All these folks that operate out of their homes.,58,,
392,0.97,2290.921,2297.028,Many of them are out of compliance with the sign code or with the parking regulations.,58,,
393,0.97,2297.028,2305.436,"This bill is intended to bring forward, make this a level playing field so that we can bring vibrancy back to the neighborhoods.",58,,
394,0.97,2305.436,2310.241,We know small businesses like yonder make our neighborhoods more vibrant.,58,,
395,0.97,2310.241,2314.445,It gives people in the city more things to do.,58,,
396,0.97,2314.445,2317.748,It's important that we solve for this problem.,58,,
397,0.97,2317.748,2322.019,"Again, this is a temporary provision for the duration of the pandemic.",58,,
398,0.97,2322.019,2327.324,We will be using this pilot as a means to study the benefits and drawbacks of this proposal.,58,,
399,0.97,2327.324,2333.164,"Colleagues, if you have any questions, we will be having a briefing this week.",58,,
400,0.97,2333.164,2336.367,I look forward to discussing this more with you.,58,,
401,0.97,2336.367,2346.177,"Additionally, there are eight appointments to the Seattle planning Commission on today's full council agenda.",58,,
402,0.97,2346.177,2348.446,The next meeting of the committee is this Wednesday at 9:30.,58,,
403,0.97,2348.446,2351.882,There are three items on our agenda.,58,,
404,0.97,2351.882,2356.987,"Briefing and discussion of bringing business home, a small business flexibility bill that was just discussed.",58,,
405,0.97,2356.987,2365.296,A briefing from the Department of neighborhoods on their our Sgi report.,58,,
406,0.97,2365.296,2369.7,A briefing from the urban forestry report on their annual report and 2020 Workplan.,58,,
407,0.97,2369.7,2373.971,"Just wanted to stop and see colleagues, any questions on committee work?",58,,
408,0.97,2373.971,2375.005,Okay.,59,,
409,0.97,2375.005,2383.547,"Colleagues, we do have an opportunity to have questions and comments on Councilmember Strauss' report.",59,,
410,0.97,2383.547,2386.517,Looks like Councilmember Mosqueda might have a question.,59,,
411,0.97,2386.517,2387.818,Please.,59,,
412,0.97,2387.818,2391.889,Thank you very much.,60,,
413,0.97,2391.889,2400.03,"Thank you very much Councilmember Strauss for your leadership on this legislation regarding the temporary zoning changes for small businesses, storefronts, like yonder.",60,,
414,0.97,2400.03,2404.034,I too have the opportunity to have Email conversations with them.,60,,
415,0.97,2404.034,2413.844,"When really alerted to it, it was from quite a few neighbors from the area that thought this was pretty outrageous that they were going to have to shut down.",60,,
416,0.97,2413.844,2416.447,Appreciate you and the Council President moving forward with legislation.,60,,
417,0.97,2416.447,2428.359,"It does seem like how we have changed many small infrastructure policies over the last year, this is a great example of where we should continue to look at ways to make our communities more Walkable.",60,,
418,0.97,2428.359,2430.461,More livable.,60,,
419,0.97,2430.461,2433.531,More friendly for small businesses.,60,,
420,0.97,2433.531,2445.075,"Those Street closures should be areas where small businesses can crop up, especially when people are walking by.",60,,
421,0.97,2445.075,2458.322,"I think this is a great example where we know that parking in front of buildings and fast traffic in front of buildings, even small establishments like the one that we've heard about from the North end to the South end, they are more likely to have patrons when people can walk and see them from the storefront.",60,,
422,0.97,2458.322,2462.993,From the street instead of having cars pass by them or parked in front.,60,,
423,0.97,2462.993,2464.862,I think it just makes a ton of sense.,60,,
424,0.97,2464.862,2469.467,Looking forward to supporting this and very pleased to hear about you moving this forward.,60,,
425,0.97,2469.467,2473.504,The question I had was are we able to both have a briefing and possible vote?,60,,
426,0.97,2473.504,2477.608,Or are you planning to do a vote at a different meeting?,60,,
427,0.97,2477.608,2481.111,I believe the plan right now is to do a vote on the second meeting.,61,,
428,0.97,2481.111,2483.714,"So, this will just be a briefing and discussion.",61,,
429,0.97,2483.714,2486.183,I'll let you know if that does change.,61,,
430,0.97,2486.183,2489.62,I don't believe the agenda is officially out.,61,,
431,0.97,2489.62,2496.494,"To your point, we know that many of the most successful businesses in our country and in our world were originally started out of the garage.",61,,
432,0.97,2496.494,2506.237,"People's entrepreneurial spirit needs to be given the support to thrive, especially during these times that we are spending so much time at home.",61,,
433,0.97,2506.237,2509.707,This bill would provide that flexibility to be able to support them in their entrepreneurial spirit.,61,,
434,0.97,2509.707,2514.144,"I wanted to call it the garage bill, but it wasn't flying.",61,,
435,0.97,2514.144,2523.854,"Councilmember Strauss and I can find consensus on many things, but the garage bill was one we couldn't agree on.",62,,
436,0.97,2523.854,2526.357,So too.,63,,
437,0.97,2526.357,2530.461,"Council President, I do have a couple more items from my report.",63,,
438,0.97,2530.461,2532.663,Unless there is question from other colleagues.,63,,
439,0.97,2532.663,2542.573,"I didn't have any questions, but did want to take an opportunity to make comments about the bill as one of the cosponsors if that's okay with you.",63,,
440,0.97,2542.573,2551.081,"Colleagues, I think Councilmember Strauss has done a great job talking about what this bill does.",63,,
441,0.97,2551.081,2556.487,Queuing up some of the substance to policy issues that the bill is intended to address.,63,,
442,0.97,2556.487,2558.656,I absolutely agree.,63,,
443,0.97,2558.656,2564.094,I think this is a commonsense policy.,63,,
444,0.97,2564.094,2574.905,"Covid-19 continues to keep many of us at home, and this is one way we can be innovative and nimble while addressing our outdated mandates and regulations that simply don't make sense during this pandemic period of time.",63,,
445,0.97,2574.905,2584.415,"As Councilmember Strauss has mentioned, yonder's Taproom is a small business that brought to our collective attention this code issue.",63,,
446,0.97,2584.415,2590.521,It is located on a popular stay healthy street.,63,,
447,0.97,2590.521,2596.226,They have done a lot of work to ensure that their business is making every effort to be a good neighbor and to fit into the neighborhood.,63,,
448,0.97,2596.226,2606.637,"Of course they run into many issues, the liver control board or other agencies that are designed to ensure that they are meeting public health the business operating requirements.",63,,
449,0.97,2606.637,2621.218,"When it became known that they would have to close due to a home occupancy code issue, yonder received over 4000 letters of support from local community members hoping that they would be able to stay open and continue to serve the community and its existing model.",63,,
450,0.97,2621.218,2638.869,"At a time when it's not just important to support our local small businesses, but to ensure that they will be with us on the other side of this pandemic, it's also important to make sure that we are creating flexibility and options that will help Entrepreneurship and our Micro enterprises.",63,,
451,0.97,2638.869,2648.646,"This bill I believe will help lower though significant barriers like access to capital that keep many, especially entrepreneurs from starting a business.",63,,
452,0.97,2648.646,2660.257,"We know that right now across the birth, many of the most significant barriers to being able to become an entrepreneur, is rent.",63,,
453,0.97,2660.257,2670.801,That is a real significant barrier for women and for entrepreneurs who have the desire and interest to start a business.,63,,
454,0.97,2670.801,2683.58,"But, the ultimate goal of being able to move into a Brick-And- mortar is elusive for many because of the commercial issues that continue to plague our city.",63,,
455,0.97,2683.58,2690.921,"With many out of work during the pandemic, this change will also I believe help Seattle residents start a small business to add much-needed income to their households.",63,,
456,0.97,2690.921,2718.048,"This will help us get, I believe, much closer to an equitable economic recovery that will, in addition to facilitating the economic recovery revitalization of our neighborhood business district, will also add vibrancy and amenities to our neighborhoods that will help to make our neighborhoods feel more livable and be more livable.",63,,
457,0.97,2718.048,2720.951,I want to think Councilmember Strauss for his partnership on this really important bill.,63,,
458,0.97,2720.951,2723.754,I also want to thank members of his team.,63,,
459,0.97,2723.754,2736.767,"Of course, my office . really looking forward to the conversation that we are going to have in your Committee on this bill.",63,,
460,0.97,2736.767,2747.177,I'm especially excited about the changes that I think this bill will put forward to better support our small businesses across our state.,63,,
461,0.97,2747.177,2753.25,Thank you for giving me an opportunity to share my thoughts about that really important bill so that we can bring businesses home.,63,,
462,0.97,2753.25,2756.487,"Thank you, Council President.",64,,
463,0.97,2756.487,2760.157,You called out a number of things that I'd like to put a final point on.,64,,
464,0.97,2760.157,2761.191,You summarized them so well.,64,,
465,0.97,2761.191,2765.662,Which is that these businesses still have to meet other regulatory conditions.,64,,
466,0.97,2765.662,2781.678,"Whether this Department of health, liquor licensing . In yonder's case in particular, both Department and health and the liquor control belt came out and found them in compliance with their conditions.",64,,
467,0.97,2781.678,2787.851,It was the fact that we were--that this Land-Use code was the final barrier.,64,,
468,0.97,2787.851,2800.731,One of the things that really spurred me into action is that we do have these other businesses operating in the district that are out of compliance with our current Land-Use code regulations in this area.,64,,
469,0.97,2800.731,2804.434,"Once a complaint is made, there is no way to pull that back.",64,,
470,0.97,2804.434,2822.753,"If any of the fair posts the massage therapists, the Pizza shop, if there was a file complaint there would be no other course, other than to close them down without this bill.",64,,
471,0.97,2822.753,2827.191,"You brought those points forward, and I just thank you for bringing them forward.",64,,
472,0.97,2827.191,2828.826,You were spot on.,64,,
473,0.97,2828.826,2833.263,"Colleagues, any other questions on this bill?",64,,
474,0.97,2833.263,2835.532,I don't see any hands raised.,65,,
475,0.97,2835.532,2838.769,"Here we go, Councilmember Pedersen.",65,,
476,0.97,2838.769,2839.169,Please.,65,,
477,0.97,2839.169,2840.571,I just need to read the bill.,65,,
478,0.97,2840.571,2842.84,I haven't read it yet.,65,,
479,0.97,2842.84,2845.275,I look forward to reading it.,65,,
480,0.97,2845.275,2846.677,My interest is peaked after this discussion.,65,,
481,0.97,2846.677,2851.782,I will read it in context for coming to Committee.,65,,
482,0.97,2851.782,2854.785,Thank you for bringing it to committee so we can have a discussion on it.,65,,
483,0.97,2854.785,2857.254,"Great, thank you.",66,,
484,0.97,2857.254,2863.794,"In other work, my other work last week I joined the Fremont Chamber of Commerce to meet with their members.",66,,
485,0.97,2863.794,2867.998,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen for allowing me to show up late to your Committee.,66,,
486,0.97,2867.998,2875.505,We also attended a community Council which is squarely in Councilmember Juarez's district.,66,,
487,0.97,2875.505,2878.575,Thanks for letting us cross the boundaries.,66,,
488,0.97,2878.575,2880.978,I also attended the regional transportation committee last week.,66,,
489,0.97,2880.978,2886.016,I filmed the Council addition of Councilmembers Juarez and Pedersen.,66,,
490,0.97,2886.016,2888.919,Great experience.,66,,

495,0.97,2908.839,2914.945,"Here in district 6, I continue to hold resident meetings every week.",66,,
496,0.97,2914.945,2923.72,I had inspiring conversations last week with neighbors from several areas.,66,,
497,0.97,2923.72,2926.256,We did have one sneak in from magnolia.,66,,
498,0.97,2926.256,2932.129,"Councilmember Lewis, she had already spoken to you, so good work on your office hours as well.",66,,
499,0.97,2932.129,2934.031,We discussed many things.,66,,

539,0.97,3189.519,3207.237,"We overrode the veto and because no spending had occurred in 2020, we carried forward the dollars and added another $2 million for a total of $12 million in 2020, to be spent in 2021.",68,,

544,0.97,3237.667,3244.374,The budget action that we took does require that the Council act to release the dollars.,68,,

663,0.97,3956.585,3960.056,It is focused only on native women in leadership.,70,,
664,0.97,3960.056,3961.691,We always have our congressional delegation there.,70,,
665,0.97,3961.691,3965.895,Last year was exciting to have Abigail honored.,70,,
666,0.97,3965.895,3967.663,We will continue that.,70,,
667,0.97,3967.663,3974.303,Our President is also the chair of the Quinault nation.,70,,
668,0.97,3974.303,3981.31,"Tomorrow, it will be focused on the congressional confirmation hearings.",70,,
669,0.97,3981.31,3990.086,Deb Holland is currently a Congresswoman from New Mexico and an enrolled member of the PUEBLO tribe.,70,,
670,0.97,3990.086,3994.123,She is also a dear friend to me and to Indian country.,70,,
671,0.97,3994.123,4000.229,"If confirmed, she will be the first native American Secretary of the interior.",70,,
672,0.97,4000.229,4004.1,The interior was created in the Mid-1800S and was transferred from the war Department to become its own Department.,70,,
673,0.97,4004.1,4009.138,Why they stopped with parks and trees I can only guess.,70,,
674,0.97,4009.138,4013.042,"Anyway, that's where we are at.",70,,
675,0.97,4013.042,4015.911,We have five senators that have put a hold on her confirmation.,70,,
676,0.97,4015.911,4029.859,I will be up at 6:30 tomorrow to watch it live and of course we have been spending letters of support and working with our sisters who are in tribal leadership positions to make sure that she is supported.,70,,
677,0.97,4029.859,4034.764,I also will be attending the sound transit board of directors.,70,,
678,0.97,4034.764,4040.036,We are meeting this Thursday and we will start looking at the realignment scenarios for sound transit staff.,70,,
679,0.97,4040.036,4052.181,"I look forward to reporting back on that long process when we finally figure out what the realignment issues will be what the cost will be, and how we will address the Affordability gap.",70,,
680,0.97,4052.181,4055.084,Thank you.,70,,
681,0.97,4055.084,4057.553,"Thank you, Councilmember Juarez.",71,,
682,0.97,4057.553,4060.956,Any comments or questions on that report?,71,,
683,0.97,4060.956,4066.295,"Hearing none, we will go ahead and go down the line to Councilmember Lewis.",71,,
684,0.97,4066.295,4069.065,After Councilmember Lewis will be Councilmember Morales.,71,,
685,0.97,4069.065,4072.501,Good morning.,72,,
686,0.97,4072.501,4079.208,There are no items from the on the introduction and referral calendar.,72,,
687,0.97,4079.208,4088.317,Nor is there any legislation on this afternoons full council agenda from the select Committee on homelessness and strategies and investments.,72,,
688,0.97,4088.317,4107.436,"On February 24th, the select Committee on homelessness strategies and investments will meet . on the agenda, first, the permanent support of housing bill that my office has been shepherding through since December of 2020.",72,,
689,0.97,4107.436,4110.639,We will be up for a final vote in the committee and consideration of amendments.,72,,
690,0.97,4110.639,4111.841,Looking forward to that.,72,,
691,0.97,4111.841,4132.061,"Second, we will have a presentation from the executive on the shelter surge to identify some of the ways we can work together to expedite and speed along those critical Council investments that have been made and overcome some of the hurdles that are currently slowing that effort down.",72,,
692,0.97,4132.061,4140.569,I look forward to that presentation so we can really come together as a Council and the Mayor to get those critical assets stood up as soon as possible.,72,,
693,0.97,4140.569,4158.087,"In that spirit, I do want to give a brief shout out to something I know is an ongoing hurdle that could speed up the tiny houses in particular, which is to exempt tiny House villages from certain requirements.",72,,
694,0.97,4158.087,4161.757,This is a Long-Standing policy goal that has been working its way through the state Legislature.,72,,
695,0.97,4161.757,4164.36,Senator Joe Winn has a bill in Olympia to do it.,72,,
696,0.97,4164.36,4183.212,Senate bill 5428 strongly encourage all members of the pond that this is a priority for the city and the committee in their lobbying effort in my office continues to work along with the offices of many Council colleagues to support this legislation.,72,,
697,0.97,4183.212,4184.78,"Again, that is Senate bill 5428.",72,,
698,0.97,4184.78,4192.321,Encourage folks to reach out to your delegation to continue to push this forward.,72,,
699,0.97,4192.321,4199.094,Thanks Senator Joe Winn for his leadership in advancing this important priority.,72,,
700,0.97,4199.094,4208.27,"Moving on, I want to give a shout out to the human services Department now that we have some data and information from their response to the snowstorm last weekend.",72,,
701,0.97,4208.27,4214.51,Councilmember Juarez shared similar updates to the great work that Parkes was doing.,72,,
702,0.97,4214.51,4221.617,The work of the hope team and the human services Department was feeding folks into some of those shelters.,72,,
703,0.97,4221.617,4224.653,Parkes hosted and helped set up.,72,,
704,0.97,4224.653,4236.065,"The hope team in the run-up to the storm, the week before, was able to share shelter information with 228 individuals.",72,,
705,0.97,4236.065,4244.173,They provided 199 people with winter supplies and basic needs like food and water.,72,,
706,0.97,4244.173,4245.841,Direct transported 23 individuals to shelter.,72,,
707,0.97,4245.841,4254.95,It's important to note that they were working as part of a broader network of first responders also doing direct transport.,72,,
708,0.97,4254.95,4257.786,23 is not the total number of direct transports.,72,,
709,0.97,4257.786,4264.693,"It's just the number directly attributed to the hope team, but they were coordinating with the broader network.",72,,
710,0.97,4264.693,4269.365,Do want to lift up the hope team did do 23 direct transports on its own.,72,,
711,0.97,4269.365,4284.413,"I just want to close out by saying, as a former Rank-And- file city employee myself, I greatly appreciate the work that the hope team did in being active in the run-up to, and during, the storm.",72,,
712,0.97,4284.413,4290.486,I appreciate their dogged Ashy agency to stand up additional shelter.,72,,
713,0.97,4290.486,4294.089,Including the Seattle City Hall shelter which was opened at 8:00 P.M.,72,,
714,0.97,4294.089,4296.792,On that Saturday.,72,,
715,0.97,4296.792,4303.932,"To provide additional space, even capacity issues, at the other agency shelters.",72,,
716,0.97,4303.932,4312.441,"These actions surely saved lives and I look forward to hearing more about the activities of the hope team, which was formed through legislation from Councilmember Morales.",72,,
717,0.97,4312.441,4316.111,And myself in the fall.,72,,
718,0.97,4316.111,4324.219,Really appreciate the work they did during that storm and surely we have more work to do together on building and improving on that.,72,,
719,0.97,4324.219,4328.657,Really appreciate their diligence in a time of difficult crisis.,72,,
720,0.97,4328.657,4334.129,Moving on to some reports from last week.,72,,
721,0.97,4334.129,4338.033,External committees that I serve on.,72,,
722,0.97,4338.033,4353.282,Was proud to join Councilmember Morales and Mosqueda at the board of health where we added to the board of health Workplan after confirming officers.,72,,
723,0.97,4353.282,4365.06,I don't want to steal Councilmember Mosqueda's thunder but I was proud to nominate her to serve as our caucus's vice chair on that board.,72,,
724,0.97,4365.06,4370.099,Glad she graciously accepted the nomination and will continue to serve in that role.,72,,
725,0.97,4370.099,4377.005,Councilmember McDermott from the King County Council was reelected as board chairman for the board of health.,72,,
726,0.97,4377.005,4406.435,"After resolving those officer elections, we did adopt a Workplan including, as was covered in the news, a conversation around the King county home law . which, as was reported, a cross cut in December of last year indicated that it is enforced with a very strong Disproportionality towards people of color and people experiencing homelessness.",72,,
727,0.97,4406.435,4415.811,Since 2017 it was reported that at least 43% of helmet law citations were specifically made against people experiencing homelessness.,72,,
728,0.97,4415.811,4433.262,"So, I look forward to examining the helmet law, along with my colleagues on the board of health, to really grapple with reconciling critical public health goals around Incentivizing wearing helmets.",72,,
729,0.97,4433.262,4435.13,Really assessing whether this is an effective deterrent.,72,,
730,0.97,4435.13,4438.967,Whether this is working.,72,,
731,0.97,4438.967,4456.285,"Really certainly looking at if there is alternative strategies that do not bear the proven fact that this has a disproportionate impact on a lot of people in our community, and almost certainly there are lots of folks not wearing helmets who do not fall into communities.",72,,
732,0.97,4456.285,4459.888,This is disproportionately falling on.,72,,
733,0.97,4459.888,4473.068,We certainly need to look into the efficacy of that rule and look into ways to change the strategy so that it is not falling heavily on the most vulnerable communities in the city.,72,,
734,0.97,4473.068,4484.913,"Moving on, I do just want to digress a little because we did have a lot of public comment in the Finance Committee regarding just care.",72,,
735,0.97,4484.913,4490.586,"As some people can probably tell from my background, I'm in the office this morning, city hall.",72,,
736,0.97,4490.586,4496.692,"As many folks know, when I come to city hall I typically walk to work.",72,,
737,0.97,4496.692,4498.427,When I do that I walked through downtown.,72,,
738,0.97,4498.427,4500.295,I did so this morning.,72,,
739,0.97,4500.295,4506.401,I saw Boarded-Up storefronts that hosted prosperous businesses Pre-Pandemic.,72,,
740,0.97,4506.401,4513.108,I saw dozens of our neighbors sleeping in doorways who never experienced that prosperity in the first place.,72,,
741,0.97,4513.108,4517.246,Downtown will recover.,72,,
742,0.97,4517.246,4535.063,"We are going to work hard and we are going to make sure that downtown recovers, but we can't wait for the pandemic to completely end to act in mitigating many of the very real impacts that have been experienced by businesses and downtown residents on a daily basis.",72,,
743,0.97,4535.063,4541.37,That leads me to the discussion that we heard in the Finance Committee public comment on just care.,72,,
744,0.97,4541.37,4551.88,"We heard dozens of community members, many of them my constituents, Testifying to the effect that Ghesquiere has had on their businesses.",72,,
745,0.97,4551.88,4554.249,And to the neighborhoods.,72,,
746,0.97,4554.249,4567.396,"For those unfamiliar, just care is an outreach, shelter, and diversion program that is composed of, and supported by, a consortium of providers, community leaders, and business leaders.",72,,
747,0.97,4567.396,4571.6,Including the law enforcement assisted diversion program to the public defenders Association.,72,,
748,0.97,4571.6,4573.201,The chief Seattle club.,72,,
749,0.97,4573.201,4580.175,The agent counseling and others.,72,,
750,0.97,4580.175,4597.626,"Just care specifically reaches out to individuals with very high barrier needs who also have a high likelihood of potentially being criminal legal system involved, for being the source of high- frequency disorder complaints.",72,,
751,0.97,4597.626,4611.64,It offers Emplacements and hotels with support staff to help meet their underlying needs and also help respond to the needs of business districts that have high concentrations of folks with these high barriers to success.,72,,
752,0.97,4611.64,4619.748,"Of the 194 people that just care has provided our reach to, only four have refused assistance.",72,,
753,0.97,4619.748,4624.219,124 of them have been successfully placed into a hotel with support services.,72,,
754,0.97,4624.219,4634.529,"Over three quarters of these folks have reported needing mental health support, and nearly 2/3 have reported an addiction to math among other drugs.",72,,
755,0.97,4634.529,4642.337,I meet with small business owners in my district in Pioneer square and South downtown on a regular basis.,72,,
756,0.97,4642.337,4655.35,They have told me that just care has been one of the only interventions during this pandemic which has successfully and visibly moved a person in crisis from their doorway to a place where they can get help and assistance.,72,,
757,0.97,4655.35,4659.388,"Improving quality of life for that person, and for the business owner both.",72,,
758,0.97,4659.388,4672.601,"We know that just care, and mostly County supported program, faces a certain shutdown next month and last some arrangement can be reached to keep it going.",72,,
759,0.97,4672.601,4683.712,"Based on Pre-Existing relationships with hotels and providers, just care could drive and more than double its caseload to nearly 300 individuals within its existing capacity.",72,,
760,0.97,4683.712,4692.087,They could do that through this fall when we anticipate the Standup of larger shelter capacity from tiny homes and enhanced shelter.,72,,
761,0.97,4692.087,4705.5,"This week, I'm going to work with King County, with the Mayor's office, and Council colleagues to try to find some kind of solution to keep this critical work going before it turns into a pumpkin in March.",72,,
762,0.97,4705.5,4734.362,"Emphatically, and I cannot make this point strongly enough, given the state of downtown, regardless of what your opinion on how you characterize the root causes or anything else, downtown cannot have 124 more individuals who are suffering from addiction and behavioral mental health conditions to leave the hotel's where they are currently getting their needs met and go back to the downtown neighborhood.",72,,
763,0.97,4734.362,4743.271,"To the contrary, we have to commit, as a region, to offering more people who are similarly situated, an opportunity to get off the street.",72,,
764,0.97,4743.271,4753.782,"I stand with the diverse coalitions in this goal, including the public defender Association, community pathways, the downtown Seattle Association, and the Alliance for Pioneer square.",72,,
765,0.97,4753.782,4766.528,"Business districts, business owners, Dividers, community leaders, are all standing together on this saying we need to come up with a solution together and we need to do it Collaboratively.",72,,
766,0.97,4766.528,4775.303,"So, together we can create a plan to provide this compassionate service and public safety Furcal all the people in the city.",72,,
767,0.97,4775.303,4787.916,We need to really start with leaning into this program to make sure that folks that are currently getting this care and are not still in the Chinatown International district in Pioneer square treats are continuing to get that help they need.,72,,
768,0.97,4787.916,4799.361,"Also make sure we can support that plan to get up to its shovel rental capacity, for lack of a better term, of up to about 300 individuals.",72,,
769,0.97,4799.361,4803.498,"It is making a physical difference, and we still have a long way to go as all of us know.",72,,
770,0.97,4803.498,4814.543,"With that, hopefully I will have more to say by briefing next week.",72,,
771,0.97,4814.543,4825.52,A lot of folks out there in the community expect a call because this is going to be something that we need to really work on this week to meet the deadlines that have been set down based on the Timeline of the existing program.,72,,
772,0.97,4825.52,4828.557,Appreciate that opportunity to digress on that a little bit more.,72,,
773,0.97,4828.557,4834.229,Looking forward to this week.,72,,
774,0.97,4834.229,4839.734,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis for that report.",73,,
775,0.97,4839.734,4845.24,"Colleagues, again, if you have any comments or questions, please do let me know.",73,,
776,0.97,4845.24,4847.275,I see Councilmember Mosqueda is in the Queue.,73,,
777,0.97,4847.275,4850.078,"Then, Morales after that.",73,,
778,0.97,4850.078,4853.782,Thank you very much.,74,,
779,0.97,4853.782,4855.65,Thank you very much Councilmember Lewis for your report.,74,,
780,0.97,4855.65,4868.396,I want to again appreciate the line of testimony that we heard for almost 45 minutes on Friday afternoon in the Finance and housing committee that I chaired.,74,,
781,0.97,4868.396,4875.27,"Every single person who spoke, the success of the program was highlighted.",74,,
782,0.97,4875.27,4886.414,"The imperative call for action was underscored that if we don't help to support just care in this moment, folks will be lining up to get tense as they leave current housing.",74,,
783,0.97,4886.414,4889.918,That is just unacceptable.,74,,
784,0.97,4889.918,4897.225,"It is unacceptable to say this is a Kane County program, and thus a Kane County program to solve.",74,,
785,0.97,4897.225,4900.462,It is unacceptable to tell Stakeholders they should be calling King County to work it out.,74,,
786,0.97,4900.462,4917.345,"It's unacceptable when the folks that are being served are as you said, in Pioneer square, and in other areas, and many of the business owners I spoke to on a call coordinated with the Bia team spoke about the importance of this work.",74,,
787,0.97,4917.345,4921.349,Really removing those folks from the street who want to get into housing.,74,,
788,0.97,4921.349,4931.96,Removing them from some of the criminal elements that we see basically preying upon people and their Vulnerabilities.,74,,
789,0.97,4931.96,4935.23,Wanting to move folks out to the street to get those who need helping into housing.,74,,
790,0.97,4935.23,4939.067,Just care has pervaded that model.,74,,
791,0.97,4939.067,4941.736,It is absolutely something I will be supporting.,74,,
792,0.97,4941.736,4957.385,"Look forward to working with you on making sure we have our strong partnership with King County lifted up as we think about coming together, holding hands in this effort to respond to the crisis that is homelessness.",74,,
793,0.97,4957.385,4960.989,It has been Exponentially made worse by Covid and appreciate your comments here today.,74,,
794,0.97,4960.989,4966.094,Look forward to working with you and our Council colleagues as we look for immediate solutions.,74,,
795,0.97,4966.094,4975.003,"We should be helping folks fold up their tents and walk into housing, and that's what just care offers.",74,,
796,0.97,4975.003,4978.673,Thank you very much for highlighting the success.,74,,
797,0.97,4978.673,4982.11,The data behind that success and the work we will be doing this week on that effort.,74,,
798,0.97,4982.11,4984.412,Appreciate your leadership.,74,,
799,0.97,4984.412,4988.216,Councilmember Morales?,75,,
800,0.97,4988.216,4991.286,Thank you.,76,,
801,0.97,4991.286,4994.723,Thank you very much Councilmember Lewis for that update and summary.,76,,
802,0.97,4994.723,4997.125,I'm not a member of that committee.,76,,
803,0.97,4997.125,4999.794,"I'm an alternate, but I wasn't there.",76,,
804,0.97,4999.794,5005.1,It's really great to hear that there is so much public support for this program that we know.,76,,
805,0.97,5005.1,5015.844,"It has an acute impact on the folks who are participating who get referred, who get housing.",76,,
806,0.97,5015.844,5020.382,"Also, has an acute impact on the businesses that are struggling downtown.",76,,
807,0.97,5020.382,5031.259,"So, I am really glad to hear that there is so much support and so much commitment to ensuring that this program continues to get funded.",76,,
808,0.97,5031.259,5036.364,I'm happy to lend a hand in that effort and really look forward to finding a solution to this.,76,,
809,0.97,5036.364,5044.439,We know that this problem--the problem of homelessness is not going away anytime soon.,76,,
810,0.97,5044.439,5047.742,The Covid crisis continues and we need to make sure that folks are safe.,76,,
811,0.97,5047.742,5065.06,"A program like this that has such a profound impact on our neighbors and in our--on our downtown businesses, is something there is no reason for us not to be supporting.",76,,
812,0.97,5065.06,5068.263,I want to thank you for your leadership and look forward to helping get this through.,76,,
813,0.97,5068.263,5068.496,Thanks.,76,,
814,0.97,5068.496,5070.498,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",77,,
815,0.97,5070.498,5071.966,Any other comments or questions?,77,,
816,0.97,5071.966,5074.969,Councilmember Herbold please.,77,,
817,0.97,5074.969,5081.276,I too want to echo my thanks and appreciation to Councilmember Lewis for bringing this forward.,78,,
818,0.97,5081.276,5086.781,"I think it's very, very important that this Council do everything it can to act.",78,,
819,0.97,5086.781,5100.328,"It must be said I believe, and the public must understand, that our ability to affect change in this area is limited to passing legislation to appropriate funding.",78,,
820,0.97,5100.328,5125.954,"In order to effectuate the goals that we are seeking to have as a result of funding, namely the continued funding of this program, just care after March 15th, the goals of the community members who attended Councilmember a Skaters committee last week, we need the executive support for this program.",78,,
821,0.97,5125.954,5128.122,That is the bottom line.,78,,
822,0.97,5128.122,5134.562,The Mayor's office and the departments need to appropriate the funding that the Council makes available.,78,,
823,0.97,5134.562,5142.036,When we have a situation where the Mayor's office is saying this is a county program.,78,,
824,0.97,5142.036,5154.182,When the county has really gone above and beyond in addressing the needs of these two neighborhoods over the last six months.,78,,
825,0.97,5154.182,5165.193,"We need to step outside of the mindset that just because the county funded it the first six months, that we cannot do our part.",78,,
826,0.97,5165.193,5174.702,"This Council has over and over and over again appropriated funding for different hotel strategies, and not a penny has been used.",78,,
827,0.97,5174.702,5185.28,"We really, really, desperately need the support of the executive in addressing these urgent needs.",78,,
828,0.97,5185.28,5190.118,I hope that we will be able to turn a page and see that we have it after this next action.,78,,
829,0.97,5190.118,5191.486,Thank you.,78,,
830,0.97,5191.486,5195.623,"Councilmember Lewis, please.",79,,
831,0.97,5195.623,5199.894,Thank you so much.,80,,
832,0.97,5199.894,5212.24,I wanted to respond briefly about kind of this question of exactly where the dividing lines are going to be in terms of how we continue along with just care.,80,,
833,0.97,5212.24,5235.863,"One component that I think gets ignored sometimes, is like I mentioned in my presentation, a number of the folks that are engaged in just care are people who had Pre-Pandemic had a lot of exposure to the criminal legal system.",80,,
834,0.97,5235.863,5245.573,In Nonpandemic circumstances might be experiencing Incarceration in the King County jail.,80,,
835,0.97,5245.573,5269.364,"I'm not bringing that up to endorse Incarceration as a tactic to address mental health or drug addition, but I'm acknowledging where things were before the pandemic and sort of the shuffle that was made last spring to figure out a way to have some kind of alternative place to put folks, who in other circumstances, might have been in jail.",80,,
836,0.97,5269.364,5272.8,But they could not be in jail because of the pandemic.,80,,
837,0.97,5272.8,5274.602,The jail has been De- intensified and reduced.,80,,
838,0.97,5274.602,5275.903,That is a county facility.,80,,
839,0.97,5275.903,5282.377,That is a broader County coastline issue.,80,,
840,0.97,5282.377,5289.951,There is still a role we should explore in terms of how there can be some kind of coordinated effort with the county to keep this going.,80,,
841,0.97,5289.951,5296.791,I don't want to completely say that we couldn't continue to explore that route.,80,,
842,0.97,5296.791,5304.098,I think there is a very real reason why this is kind of housed at the county in the first place.,80,,
843,0.97,5304.098,5313.641,At a certain level it was kind of as a criminal justice diversion strategy that has evolved to something bigger than that.,80,,
844,0.97,5313.641,5317.645,It certainly still has implications for King County caseload.,80,,
845,0.97,5317.645,5333.561,"I think that there is a way, just as I said earlier in my comments, that we should be talking to a broad array of Stakeholders in terms of what our plan is as a Council and how we want to step into this.",80,,
846,0.97,5333.561,5336.364,I'm being less prescriptive right now then I might be a briefing next week.,80,,
847,0.97,5336.364,5339.834,In terms of what I think we should exactly do.,80,,
848,0.97,5339.834,5354.048,I do think there are some very real reasons why the county is a critical Stakeholder here and someone we should continue to talk about in how to effectuate this partnership to keep just care going.,80,,
849,0.97,5354.048,5361.789,"It should also be noted, just as a last comment, and this is something I talked to business owners all the time.",80,,
850,0.97,5361.789,5371.099,"They will talk about how they call SPD to have some kind of response to someone camping in their doorway, or who is causing chronic problems for example.",80,,
851,0.97,5371.099,5388.583,"Because the machinery of the King County jail has been greatly slow down due to the limited number of bookings and the intensification, that contact typically does not lead to that person being in a position where they won't come back to that doorway.",80,,
852,0.97,5388.583,5394.122,Officers are limited in how they--and being able to obtain a booking from King County.,80,,
853,0.97,5394.122,5407.935,"With just care, when someone is permanently placed in a hotel room, supportive services, that person will stay there with their needs getting that instead of going back to that business owner's doorway.",80,,
854,0.97,5407.935,5411.939,I think that's another important context setting thing to discuss.,80,,
855,0.97,5411.939,5415.042,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",81,,
856,0.97,5415.042,5430.658,I just want to clarify my statement that we should not use the fact that this started off as a King County program as a reason to justify not supporting it now.,82,,
857,0.97,5430.658,5434.262,No way was intended to suggest that we not continue in partnership with King County.,82,,
858,0.97,5434.262,5436.864,Thank you.,82,,
859,0.97,5436.864,5439.534,Okay.,83,,
860,0.97,5439.534,5442.837,"Excellent, excellent points.",83,,
861,0.97,5442.837,5460.354,"I think that, sort of for additional context in the spirit of what Councilmember Lewis is saying, and to thread the needle between that and what I'm hearing you say, Councilmember Herbold, is we're either in this as a region, or we are not.",83,,
862,0.97,5460.354,5473.901,"Creating false lines about who funded what first, to me, signals that we are perhaps not as wholly committed to this regional effort as we should be.",83,,
863,0.97,5473.901,5479.707,"If we are truly in this as a region, does it matter if King County cut the first check?",83,,
864,0.97,5479.707,5492.987,"Or, the size of that check, what matters is does it, and will it, continuing to support just care, will it enhance what I think our common goal is here?",83,,
865,0.97,5492.987,5502.73,Which is to get folks inside in a way that is much more effective than other systems that we currently have in place.,83,,
866,0.97,5502.73,5512.506,It certainly seems to me that this program lends itself very well to our overall strategic conversations.,83,,
867,0.97,5512.506,5531.225,"And our overall goals to bring people inside and to have places to navigate folks to that is safer, that will both be safer for the people experiencing homelessness, and will also help to address other concerns related to impacts of those who are experiencing homelessness in downtown.",83,,
868,0.97,5531.225,5535.897,"I look forward to the conversation as well, Councilmember Lewis.",83,,
869,0.97,5535.897,5541.969,Stand at the ready to be helpful in any way that I can to this effort and look forward to continuing to learn more.,83,,
870,0.97,5541.969,5556.384,"Identifying clear ways that the Council can be supportive, but also to Councilmember Herbold's point, ways that we can Incentivize this administration to fulfill Council's intent as it relates to the strategies.",83,,
871,0.97,5556.384,5563.291,We all know we are having this conversation in the context of pending funding six months ago hotels at a significant scale.,83,,
872,0.97,5563.291,5572.199,We need to see and hear that that hasn't come to permission.,83,,
873,0.97,5572.199,5576.671,I think it's important for us to have the conversation around what we want to see accomplished.,83,,
874,0.97,5576.671,5593.921,"We also have to have a very transparent conversation and forward conversation about what happens if the folks who are responsible for implementing our intent, which is this administration, if they choose to not do anything, then we will continue to see the impacts.",83,,
875,0.97,5593.921,5596.591,That I know many of us get engaged about.,83,,
876,0.97,5596.591,5602.73,On a daily basis related to the realities of the state of downtown.,83,,
877,0.97,5602.73,5607.802,Anything else colleagues on this issue?,83,,
878,0.97,5607.802,5613.641,I know we are going to have a lot more conversations about this incoming committee hearings and appreciate that.,83,,
879,0.97,5613.641,5617.311,"Okay, looks like that concludes this conversation.",83,,
880,0.97,5617.311,5619.513,We are going to go down the line.,83,,
881,0.97,5619.513,5620.548,Councilmember Morales is next.,83,,
882,0.97,5620.548,5622.55,Then Mosqueda.,83,,
883,0.97,5622.55,5629.457,Good morning colleagues.,84,,
884,0.97,5629.457,5633.361,There are no items on the community economic development Committee on today's agenda.,84,,
885,0.97,5633.361,5644.138,The next meeting will be this Friday at 9:30 where we will have a slew of appointments and we will also be hearing the final presentation of the black brilliance research project.,84,,
886,0.97,5644.138,5650.244,"As you know, this is the preliminary research, not the Participatory budget process itself.",84,,
887,0.97,5650.244,5657.284,"In order to begin that process, my office will be meeting this week with the executive's office.",84,,
888,0.97,5657.284,5665.059,Begin discussion about implementation and to talk about creating a spending plan for implementation.,84,,
889,0.97,5665.059,5673.768,We need to approve an ordinance approving the spending plan in order to lift the proviso that funds the beginning of implementation.,84,,
890,0.97,5673.768,5677.805,"We will be having those, beginning those conversations.",84,,
891,0.97,5677.805,5686.38,"My hope is that by the March meeting we will--my March meeting, we will be able to move that forward.",84,,

895,0.97,5706.834,5716.01,You may know district to is the most overt district in the Seattle valley.,84,,
896,0.97,5716.01,5722.349,"The Ranier Valley is a cultural home to many artists, musicians, and cultural institutions.",84,,
897,0.97,5722.349,5725.753,Really influenced a rich history.,84,,
898,0.97,5725.753,5729.824,It really continues to shape the legacy of South Seattle today.,84,,
899,0.97,5729.824,5740.367,"It is my hope that with this creative district designation, it will not only create the cultural legacy, but lift up and empower the younger generation to contribute to it.",84,,
900,0.97,5740.367,5745.539,"As we start to plan for post pandemic recovery, we want to ensure that it is just and equitable.",84,,
901,0.97,5745.539,5750.344,It centers communities that have been most marginalized.,84,,
902,0.97,5750.344,5754.982,That's why it's crucial that South Seattle have a platform.,84,,
903,0.97,5754.982,5762.69,The work of artists and cultural workers who make our city a vibrant work place to live.,84,,

908,0.97,5791.619,5796.423,"Starting Wednesday, there will be a two week period with only small businesses with fewer than 20 employees that can apply.",84,,
909,0.97,5796.423,5803.898,There is also some important changes to the funding formula that will support contractors for sole proprietors that don't have payroll.,84,,
910,0.97,5803.898,5806.033,Just an owner.,84,,
911,0.97,5806.033,5808.636,So they can participate too.,84,,
912,0.97,5808.636,5819.446,There will also be some eligibility changes so a longer longer bars owners with felony connection or those have defaulted on student loans.,84,,
913,0.97,5819.446,5834.762,"This will make it easier for Micro businesses, women owned businesses, and those owned by people of color, to get a meaningful opportunity to engage in the application process to get the access to capital that they are often denied.",84,,
914,0.97,5834.762,5840.134,Moving onto district.,84,,
915,0.97,5840.134,5844.271,Last week I met with community members and several folks from Safeway to discuss safety improvements in their parking lot.,84,,
916,0.97,5844.271,5845.84,This is an ongoing conversation.,84,,
917,0.97,5845.84,5856.784,Those meetings will continue in an effort to create a partnership between the store and the community organizations that are doing community safety work on the ground.,84,,
918,0.97,5856.784,5869.597,"This week I'll also be meeting with residents, local business owners, homeless outreach service providers, and the southeast crime prevention coordinator in the mountain neighborhood, to discuss community safety issues there.",84,,

927,0.97,5917.344,5920.547,Any comments or questions on that report?,85,,
928,0.97,5920.547,5923.217,"All right, hearing none.",85,,
929,0.97,5923.217,5927.421,We will go ahead and move over to Councilmember Mosqueda.,85,,
930,0.97,5927.421,5928.055,Good morning.,85,,
931,0.97,5928.055,5930.925,Good morning.,86,,
932,0.97,5930.925,5937.031,There are quite a few items I will try to be brief.,86,,
933,0.97,5937.031,5941.468,There are no items on today's full council agenda from the Finance and housing committee.,86,,
934,0.97,5941.468,5951.645,Though I am very much looking forward to voting on resolution 31993 as we Continueto see pressure to develop and Redevelop.,86,,
935,0.97,5951.645,5965.459,We are seeing Gentrification increase and I really appreciate that this resolution calls on us to both create and [Indiscernible] build new affordable housing and housing units of all types across our city.,86,,
936,0.97,5965.459,5972.166,Really appreciate this community led effort to push for creative strategies in that district.,86,,
937,0.97,5972.166,5981.508,"From the Finance and housing Committee report, our next Finance and housing committee will be on March 2ND at 9:30 A.M.",86,,
938,0.97,5981.508,5988.015,We will take time to have a briefing discussion and possible vote on the capital projects Watchlist.,86,,
939,0.97,5988.015,5996.323,"Folks from my committee will note that on Friday we did not have a chance to get to those items, so we will do both the briefing and possible vote on March 2ND.",86,,
940,0.97,5996.323,6004.264,"If you do have any amendments, and this goes for the entire Council, please do take a look at the Watchlist.",86,,
941,0.97,6004.264,6012.206,We would very much like to entertain any additional items are possible amendments to that list on March 2ND so that we can have that discussion and Committee and bring it forward to the full council.,86,,
942,0.97,6012.206,6019.513,"If you do have any Edits for any of our Council colleagues, please let us know.",86,,
943,0.97,6019.513,6028.222,I'm going to shoot for noon on Wednesday if you can send those over to our office or work with central staff on those amendments that would be greatly appreciated.,86,,
944,0.97,6028.222,6033.46,We've already talked a little bit about the conversation we had in the Finance and housing committee last Friday.,86,,
945,0.97,6033.46,6037.197,I wanted to provide a summary for all Councilmembers on some of the key Takeaways from the last presentation.,86,,
946,0.97,6037.197,6053.046,"Offered by the city budget office, from our Intergovernmental affairs team, and especially thanks to Wesley Palmer who is from Holland and knight, our Federal representative in the halls of Congress.",86,,
947,0.97,6053.046,6058.485,"Really appreciate the Walk- through of the presentation if you haven't had the chance to look at the detail Powerpoint, our office can share that with you.",86,,
948,0.97,6058.485,6060.888,Some important highlights for you all from that conversation.,86,,
949,0.97,6060.888,6067.394,"We learned that the reimbursement for King County, for Federal assistance has been about six months.",86,,
950,0.97,6067.394,6073.767,The King County partners have received their funding for the first six months of their Covid relief efforts already.,86,,
951,0.97,6073.767,6077.171,Which is great news.,86,,
952,0.97,6077.171,6081.208,This is helpful for us as we seek to get FEMA reimbursement.,86,,
953,0.97,6081.208,6085.112,Our past experience has been a much longer situation than that.,86,,
954,0.97,6085.112,6096.723,We know we need to be working as fast as possible to receive FEMA reimbursement and not have that delay in reimbursement affect our programming and supportive services that we want to get out the door.,86,,
955,0.97,6096.723,6115.542,"Hearing that from both our Federal representatives, having that underscored as well as our meeting last week, and again some questions about the reimbursement Timeline in meeting last Friday, gives me hope that we will be on a much faster Timeline than originally anticipated to receive that allocated funding from the Feds.",86,,
956,0.97,6115.542,6127.354,We also learned that the city budget office has submitted five Million-Dollar requests for reimbursement in October of 2020.,86,,
957,0.97,6127.354,6131.625,They will soon be submitting for another $10 million in FEMA reimbursement requests.,86,,
958,0.97,6131.625,6133.861,This is a total of $15 million for the year 2020.,86,,
959,0.97,6133.861,6148.275,The Timeline for when--and I will note that that is less than the amount of money that we originally thought they were going to be submitting for over $30 million is what we originally thought.,86,,
960,0.97,6148.275,6156.783,I think that there is ongoing questions about how quickly we can also get the other a location out the door and hopefully be able to still get reimbursement for those dollars as well.,86,,
961,0.97,6156.783,6175.469,"The Timeline for when the Covid relief funds, which were around $130 million, and we received those in 2020, we knew that we must expend those dollars as fast as possible, but we have now learned that we can spend the remaining amount that is left over through September, 2021.",86,,
962,0.97,6175.469,6182.209,Is about $28 million of unspent funds.,86,,
963,0.97,6182.209,6188.482,"But, $10.9 million of that was allocated specifically for various purposes within departments.",86,,
964,0.97,6188.482,6194.221,We did ask for clarification on what those specific dollar amounts were allocated for.,86,,
965,0.97,6194.221,6205.532,What the plan is for the remainder $17 million which I think is a sum of opportunities for future Council the Russian for conversations with the executive about how we would like to see the remaining analysis new.,86,,
966,0.97,6205.532,6214.107,"It also reported that there is about $17 million, as I mentioned.",86,,
967,0.97,6214.107,6221.815,"I wanted to reiterate, this was about 25% of the funds that we were holding back just in case the city needed to match the amount.",86,,
968,0.97,6221.815,6235.629,"Now, given that the expenses from FEMA reimbursed efforts are going to be able to receive full reimbursement, it gives us the opportunity to think about how we can use that $17 million.",86,,
969,0.97,6235.629,6242.803,Because the revised FEMA guidance from the by the administration just last month will now provide 100% reimbursement for FEMA eligible expenses.,86,,
970,0.97,6242.803,6245.973,That applies retroactively.,86,,
971,0.97,6245.973,6252.279,"The city will not need funding for the 25% match, or the roughly $17 million that they were holding back.",86,,
972,0.97,6252.279,6264.057,"However, I want to reiterate something . It is suggested that the contingency still makes sense if any of the requests for reimbursement are rejected.",86,,
973,0.97,6264.057,6273.8,Central staff is working to verify that number and to make sure that counsel has an understanding of what might be available for other city's needs.,86,,
974,0.97,6273.8,6278.872,We also know that there are some restrictions apparently that will be applied to those FEMA dollars.,86,,
975,0.97,6278.872,6281.908,That was noted by the CBO.,86,,
976,0.97,6281.908,6290.617,"As our Council colleagues said, many other cities are moving forward with spending.",86,,
977,0.97,6290.617,6293.787,Spending those FEMA dollars assuming that there is going to be 100% FEMA reimbursement.,86,,
978,0.97,6293.787,6303.83,We see this in Los Angeles and San Francisco with their immediate use of those dollars for standing up hotel rooms.,86,,
979,0.97,6303.83,6312.205,"Very similar to the strategy that Councilmember Lewis, myself, Councilmember Herbold, Morales, and Gonzalez all spoke out in response to Councilmember Lewis's response.",86,,
980,0.97,6312.205,6323.15,I think there's a huge sense of urgency to want to make sure that we are using the FEMA dollars and that we are not holding back any money or holding back a of our proposals.,86,,
981,0.97,6323.15,6327.22,Now waiting for that to be Greaterclarification when we see other jurisdictions moving forward.,86,,
982,0.97,6327.22,6333.327,The director assured us that there will not be any and that cash flow would not be an issue.,86,,
983,0.97,6333.327,6343.07,This is really important for us to continue monitoring and working in partnership to make sure that the 100% of the FEMA Reimbursable efforts to get out the door.,86,,
984,0.97,6343.07,6345.872,What to expect next.,86,,
985,0.97,6345.872,6348.575,We talked a little bit about dollars that were carrying over.,86,,
986,0.97,6348.575,6371.698,"We talked a little bit about this issue of wanting to move with expediency to make sure that programs and services like just care quickly moves forward and now we know that we will have roughly around $221 million to the city of Seattle from, fingers crossed, this new Federal assistance that is coming--going to be authorized by Congress.",86,,
987,0.97,6371.698,6377.003,This is a huge opportunity for cities across the country.,86,,
988,0.97,6377.003,6385.312,Cities like ours who stepped up and acted with urgency to continue to be able to provide needed services and help fill in the gaps where we have seen a lot of unmet need.,86,,
989,0.97,6385.312,6389.983,Even in spite of our efforts to try to get money out the door through our early Covid relief funds.,86,,
990,0.97,6389.983,6392.085,Applying the Covid relief dollars from the Federal dollars.,86,,
991,0.97,6392.085,6400.327,Anticipated use of the reserves knowing that jumps in revenue are coming in the door.,86,,
992,0.97,6400.327,6408.235,"This is an opportunity for us to do more assistance to small businesses, food insecure families, housing assistance and Affordability issues.",86,,
993,0.97,6408.235,6411.371,Making sure that there is permanent supportive housing to complement any shelter services.,86,,
994,0.97,6411.371,6416.643,That we do this with an X or the lands as we seek to implement these new dollars.,86,,
995,0.97,6416.643,6436.73,"The new announcement from the Federal partners, or from our Federal lobbyists also came with a caveat that we should remember that this is probably the last time that the Federal delegation will be able to step in and offer Covid relief through congressional action.",86,,
996,0.97,6436.73,6461.087,"While we are very much appreciative of the Federal dollars for Covid relief and recovery efforts, we need to think about both the short and the long term needs given that the sources of revenue from the Federal congressional effort are both an effort to try to make sure that we are rebounding our local economy, and responding to the immediate crisis that we see so many families dealing with.",86,,
997,0.97,6461.087,6475.535,"So, we are going to work on that balancing act and make sure that we respond to those immediate needs and think about the longer-term systemic investments to strive towards, and create, the foundation for a more equitable recovery when considering this next round of Federal dollars.",86,,
998,0.97,6475.535,6484.478,"We've done a lot, colleagues and very proud of the work you all did, the initial package that we passed at $86 million for Covid relief.",86,,
999,0.97,6484.478,6494.221,The eventual compromised down to $45 million over two years still provided a tremendous amount of relief especially to immigrant families through cash assistance.,86,,
1000,0.97,6494.221,6497.157,Working families forced two assistance.,86,,
1001,0.97,6497.157,6515.542,"Small businesses and Hard- working folks who are most Foldable per on Friday in committee I noted that we were working on a draft resolution for your consideration, input and Edits to indicate additional priority investments.",86,,
1002,0.97,6515.542,6518.545,For the new Federal resources.,86,,
1003,0.97,6518.545,6532.158,"Building on those conversations we had early last year, as we tracked the Covid relief proposal and building on subsequent conversations I know many of us have had with community members, including folks that need ongoing rental assessments.",86,,
1004,0.97,6532.158,6534.561,Small businesses who need flexible dollars to open back up.,86,,
1005,0.97,6534.561,6544.17,And hire folks to change their places of employment to make them more protective of both employees and patrons.,86,,
1006,0.97,6544.17,6556.349,We know that we've learned a lot in the last few weeks and months about what is actually continued to be needed right now.,86,,
1007,0.97,6556.349,6564.491,We are going to be working on coming up with a resolution that helps put some parameters and direction for how these Federal relief dollars can and should be used.,86,,
1008,0.97,6564.491,6571.398,You can expect to see a draft from us for your input later this week as we would like to make sure that the full Council has a chance to see that early.,86,,
1009,0.97,6571.398,6580.707,"We will be working to get that out and with the Council President's office, published as soon as possible so we can get folks' feedback on that.",86,,
1010,0.97,6580.707,6588.815,We will be circulating the resolution later this week and look forward to any amendments that you may have in the Committee on March 2ND.,86,,

1020,0.97,6646.673,6649.576,That includes partnerships.,86,,
1021,0.97,6649.576,6666.393,I'll just note that FAS has been working very hard to as soon and am away between public health and Seattle King County to assist King County residents with access to vaccination sites by the phone as we have heard so many Elders and folks who are vulnerable don't have access to high-speed Internet.,86,,

1087,0.97,7148.374,7171.464,"Deliverables that were scheduled to be received last October, and to my understanding, because of Covid- 19, that work as anticipated, or as planned, by the executive order, has not been done.",88,,
1088,0.97,7171.464,7188.08,My recollection is the reason it was not done was because the executive pointed to funding Vulnerabilities associated with Covid-19 that made it difficult for them to find and staff to work.,88,,
1089,0.97,7188.08,7205.331,"Much of the approach identified in the Deliverables is actually now being led by King County government, which actually used Covid-19 as a way to get funding for this work.",88,,
