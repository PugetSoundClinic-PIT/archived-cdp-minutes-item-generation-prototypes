38,0.97,317.05,324.324,I am a writer and I'm calling in support of the Council bill to extend the meetings and allow for administrative review.,12,,
39,0.97,324.324,333.966,"Ultimately, Seattle needs to repaint the views and as far as I can tell, the only people happy with the review are people that want to delay more housing from being built.",12,,
40,0.97,333.966,342.141,It is long past time to other cities achieve good design whilst uniting the approval process.,12,,
41,0.97,342.141,350.983,I applaud the exception of affordable housing and hope this is made permanent.,12,,
42,0.97,350.983,354.253,We are in the middle of a severe housing crisis and RC declared homelessness emergency years ago.,12,,
43,0.97,354.253,390.022,Our city has been sweeping our neighbors across the city and Brutalizing people and this is during Covid-19 in a season of regular heat waves . I urge you to do this in the short term while exercising long terms with supportive housing.,12,,
44,0.97,390.022,393.459,The crisis will only worsen once the ban ends and puts more families in a precarious situation.,12,,
45,0.97,393.459,402.201,"The faster we build permanent affordable housing, the less you will need to spend on Short- term solutions and exempting them from the review which is one small way to do this.",12,,
46,0.97,402.201,407.306,Thank you for your time today.,12,,
47,0.97,407.306,408.141,"Thank you, mark.",13,,

50,0.97,418.05,425.158,I am Megan Cruz here to address 119877.,14,,
51,0.97,425.158,435.735,This was an urgent measure looking at the review in favor of internal administrative review but only until Online meetings could begin.,14,,
52,0.97,435.735,452.185,"The public was told it was necessary for affordable housing to move forward in the pandemic but this bill goes beyond extending the meeting even though they are up and running, it expands the Timeline and criteria for Market-Rate projects to qualify through the end of the year.",14,,
53,0.97,452.185,461.961,It will extend discretionary power to make all of the bills measures extend until six months after the emergency proclamation.,14,,
54,0.97,461.961,463.229,It is the definition of overreach.,14,,
55,0.97,463.229,473.039,"We know business is still booming engine alone, it to record 600 million and permits much from big Market-Rate developments.",14,,
56,0.97,473.039,496.429,"Since August, I have asked chair Strauss's assistance and help especially for downtown and we still don't know how many have affordable housing and the Council should know this information.",14,,
57,0.97,496.429,506.472,"It should not be because they expected a path from the design process and without public review, we use and lose board members.",14,,
58,0.97,506.472,515.882,This makes for more sustainable and Equable Developmnt citizens that fell they are not being shut out of a process that directly impacts their lives.,14,,
59,0.97,515.882,522.622,People considered the original bill would lead to a transparency and public participation.,14,,
60,0.97,522.622,523.189,Please prove them wrong.,14,,
61,0.97,523.189,530.162,This noodles to be more or no more than a technical bill until it can be in person.,14,,
62,0.97,530.162,533.432,Thank you for this time.,14,,
63,0.97,533.432,534.033,"Thank you, Megan.",15,,
64,0.97,534.033,539.071,I appreciate hearing those remarks and I think we will incorporate some of those changes.,15,,

69,0.97,569.769,592.058,"I am a Renter and I'm calling out CB 19877 and I would like you to extend the ordinance 126702 to make sure that a Forcible housing is expedited at this time and if we end Edr and make folks go back to regular design review right now, we are slowing down affordable housing.",16,,
70,0.97,592.058,607.74,We have a housing and homelessness emergency and climate emergency and a Covid- 19 emergency and imagine being outdoors today with asthma and breathing in the particular air and afraid to go to congregate shelter.,16,,
71,0.97,607.74,613.646,Afraid of getting Covid-19 or getting your hopes up for a shelter.,16,,
72,0.97,613.646,618.351,It is emotionally and physically abusive to not provide housing for all of Seattleites.,16,,
73,0.97,618.351,623.189,It is a human rights violation.,16,,
74,0.97,623.189,628.661,"In the regular designing view, it's really important.",16,,
75,0.97,628.661,639.171,We can just allow the Marty happens to Philip they can control the design of our city as an excuse for not providing housing for folks that need affordable housing.,16,,
76,0.97,639.171,655.688,I really encourage you to keep the ADR in place during the Covid-19 crisis and beyond and especially for affordable housing.,16,,
77,0.97,655.688,672.638,We need you to focus on Prioritizing people getting & amp; tiny House villages and other temporary shelters and allowing trailers to be part in people's driveways and have a not be illegal.,16,,
78,0.97,672.638,680.112,Allow people to find safe locks and Expending all of our emergency housing solutions.,16,,

80,0.97,689.622,699.999,"Ryan, taken away.",17,,
81,0.97,701.267,707.74,This is Ryan Paul and I am calling in support of CB 119877.,18,,
82,0.97,707.74,713.112,I just want to echo the previous speakers and their points.,18,,
83,0.97,713.112,736.535,"We need to Prioritize affordable housing and all the main crises, we have not kept up with anything that we need and people are frankly not able to find housing in the city and are leaving Seattle.",18,,
84,0.97,736.535,748.147,"If we are going to make Seattle an affordable place for everyone to live, we need to look at our processes and see what we can do to make it better.",18,,
85,0.97,748.147,752.384,Affordable housing has never really been very affordable.,18,,
86,0.97,752.384,764.797,I would strongly urge any amendments or bills that are pushed through to look for affordable housing.,18,,
87,0.97,764.797,765.798,Thank you.,18,,
88,0.97,765.798,770.87,"Thank you, Ryan.",19,,
89,0.97,770.87,779.612,Chris Lehman and then Richard and Nicole Swinney has just signed up.,19,,
90,0.97,779.612,783.415,"If you join us, please do so.",19,,
91,0.97,783.415,783.816,"Chris, welcome.",19,,
92,0.97,783.816,787.72,Can you hear me?,20,,
93,0.97,787.72,789.121,"I can, how are you?",21,,
94,0.97,789.121,789.522,Good.,22,,
95,0.97,789.522,791.223,I am Commenting on two things.,22,,
96,0.97,791.223,799.098,"First of all, it is surprising to hear people say that regular design review is not valuable.",22,,
97,0.97,799.098,811.977,It is absolutely important for any housing and building and especially affordable housing to be improved by that expert process.,22,,
98,0.97,811.977,816.315,"Also, it's a very good thing for buildings to be accepted and supported in their communities.",22,,
99,0.97,816.315,829.862,That was the original purpose and it's very alarming and should be opposed not to use regular design review as promised.,22,,
100,0.97,829.862,843.375,I am concerned about the process for the hearing on the scope or the scope and decisions on the annual comprehensive plan amendments.,22,,
101,0.97,843.375,864.864,"It doesn't say that you will take a vote on those amendments and I trust that because your agenda doesn't say so that you will be doing so and at the very earliest, you couldn't do that until September 23 and I urge that you take longer because the process has been so difficult for people to know how to find out what the comments are.",22,,
102,0.97,864.864,894.36,"I have proposed seven plan amendments and every single one of them is recommended not to even be studied in the final minute to two minutes in a hearing, I will have to stand no more than 17 seconds on each of those and in the past, for decades, people and I sent you an Email about this and the other members of the committee.",22,,
103,0.97,894.36,914.046,"There was a provision that the applicant's would be allowed a certain amount of extra time in order to present their amendments and if you can't do that, allow everyone a little more time so they can comment on more than one amendment otherwise seconds would not be meaningful.",22,,
104,0.97,914.046,914.38,Thank you.,22,,
105,0.97,914.38,915.047,Thank you.,23,,
106,0.97,915.047,924.823,We have reviewed your proposed amendments in depth and I believe they have been addressed in other ways.,23,,
107,0.97,924.823,939.271,I will likely give you a couple of extra minutes if we give you five minutes in total for all of your amendments once we get to the public hearing noting that you have also used two minutes just now.,23,,
108,0.97,939.271,941.273,I think that would be a great way going forward.,23,,
109,0.97,941.273,943.175,Richard Allison and the Nicole Swinney.,23,,
110,0.97,943.175,947.579,I see you are not present at the moment.,23,,
111,0.97,947.579,952.685,If you would like to join us.,23,,
112,0.97,952.685,955.921,I will give it just one more minute.,23,,
113,0.97,964.196,966.665,"Not seeing none present, I will check with the clerk and I.T.",23,,
114,0.97,966.665,971.37,That we have no other folks signed up for public comments.,23,,
115,0.97,971.37,974.807,That is correct.,24,,
116,0.97,974.807,984.717,We will move on to the next agenda item.,25,,
117,0.97,984.717,993.926,Efforts and my business is breaking a public hearing for CB 119838.,25,,
118,0.97,993.926,997.129,Will you please read the abbreviated title and the record.,25,,
119,0.97,997.129,1045.878,"Agenda item 1, an ordinance relating to land use and zoning; amending the Seattle comprehensive plan to incorporate changes proposed as part of the 2019-2020 comprehensive plan annual amendment.",26,,
120,0.97,1045.878,1047.146,Please give us a breathing.,27,,
121,0.97,1047.146,1047.88,Good morning.,28,,
122,0.97,1047.88,1055.587,I am in the central staff and I would love to give you a briefing and the Council bill that you just read into the record has two changes to the comprehensive plan.,28,,
123,0.97,1055.587,1075.808,The plan is the core Foundational policy document to guide the city's growth and has a horizon of 20 years and the state law requires that it be Revisited for major updates every eight Y█Ears.,28,,
124,0.97,1075.808,1085.317,It can be amended each year and the Council has set up a resolution for the annual process to do that.,28,,
125,0.97,1085.317,1091.19,This bill is the commendation of the process that began last year so you can think of that as the 2019 and 2020 cycle.,28,,
126,0.97,1091.19,1102.801,The initials were kickoff in the first decision that Council makes is to resolve to say what items should be studied.,28,,
127,0.97,1102.801,1118.016,"That was done last year through a resolution number 31896 and you will notice on the agenda today in the second item, it's a resolution for the next annual cycle.",28,,
128,0.97,1118.016,1122.254,That is the 2020-2021 cycle.,28,,
129,0.97,1122.254,1130.229,The only thing I want to say about that is they were number of items that were adopted for study.,28,,
130,0.97,1130.229,1140.138,Two of those are in the bill and others are recommended for picking up in a different manner.,28,,
131,0.97,1140.138,1145.611,"If you have any other questions, I would be happy to answer them now or otherwise I will step aside and let the folks take it over.",28,,
132,0.97,1158.79,1165.531,My name is Michael Hubner and I'm the manager in the office of planning and community development.,29,,
133,0.97,1165.531,1169.201,I am joined by Jim Holmes.,29,,
134,0.97,1169.201,1170.002,I am here.,30,,
135,0.97,1170.002,1171.47,Thank you.,31,,
136,0.97,1171.47,1179.545,Jim is a strategic advisor and leads the annual amendment process.,31,,
137,0.97,1179.545,1182.614,"Next slide, please.",31,,
138,0.97,1182.614,1195.394,What we will do briefly this morning is review the response and I have a correction to the first bullet here.,31,,
139,0.97,1195.394,1203.936,"Apologies and if there were a total of eight proposals for the annual amendment, not 11.",31,,
140,0.97,1203.936,1208.006,That is also a correction to your memo this morning.,31,,
141,0.97,1208.006,1220.986,We responded to eight proposals that were documented last year and three of the proposed amendments were further analyzed and will report out on our analysis and recommendations.,31,,
142,0.97,1220.986,1232.998,Two of those analyzed amendments are adopted and one of the proposed amendments is the recommendation is to not adopt.,31,,
143,0.97,1232.998,1233.432,"Next slide, please.",31,,
144,0.97,1233.432,1247.613,I very briefly want to review and this is consistent with the recommendations on the docket last year and what the response was.,31,,
145,0.97,1247.613,1273.805,"These were items that were subsequently documented but at the time in our review, it has been consistent and five of the docketed amendments were areas are in approach to that timing in the manner of which they should be taken up in the first is impact fees.",31,,
146,0.97,1273.805,1282.114,This is amendments that would provide for the ability of the city to adopt impact fees.,31,,
147,0.97,1282.114,1315.447,"This was being looked on and at the time of the Docker, this was an issue that was being read by Council and the Council had developed proposed amendments with the process in 2019 that was subsequently appealed in our understanding is that work is on pause right now so that is not something that we worked on in preparation for today.",31,,
148,0.97,1315.447,1342.074,"The second docketed item, for single-family zoning and this is an item we would prefer to address in the major update which is a process that will be initiated next year culminating and adoption of a full plan in 2024.",31,,
149,0.97,1342.074,1365.397,We feel that taking on naming conventions for major Land-Use categories is best to address as we kick on a more substantive and comprehensive Land-Use and housing policy and in this case that relate to single-family and comprehensive Land-Use maps.,31,,
150,0.97,1365.397,1371.303,"Also, considerable community engagement.",31,,
151,0.97,1371.303,1375.574,It seems we have a question from our vice chair.,32,,
152,0.97,1375.574,1376.208,I'm sorry.,33,,
153,0.97,1376.208,1385.717,I hear a little bit of echo so I will wait for you if you're still talking about bullet number two but I just want to make a comment before we move on.,34,,
154,0.97,1385.717,1387.686,"I am not talking, apologies for the echo.",35,,
155,0.97,1387.686,1389.988,Please let me know that continues.,35,,
156,0.97,1389.988,1391.022,Thank you.,36,,
157,0.97,1391.022,1416.348,I just wanted to fight on this item and I'm interested in continuing to advance the conversations around the name change for single-family zones to update to a more inclusive and accurate name such as neighborhood residential and I would like to work with the chair and members of this Committee and I know this is something other members have expressed interest in as well.,36,,
158,0.97,1416.348,1443.108,This is something we docketed last year on a competing resolution and again during the comprehensive plan and the Docketing process and this has been recommended as well and I think it is very important that we not get into what I think is a well Researched and well studied recommendation.,36,,
159,0.97,1443.108,1447.879,It is a minor change that fits squarely within this update.,36,,
160,0.97,1447.879,1455.387,It is minor and should not wait until the next comprehensive plan in my opinion.,36,,
161,0.97,1455.387,1467.999,I want to make sure that I find that interesting I know many other Councilmembers are probably interested in that along with the leadership of the good chair so thank you for your leadership.,36,,
162,0.97,1467.999,1469.267,"So noted, thank you, Vice- chair Mosqueda.",37,,
163,0.97,1469.267,1473.471,Let's follow up after the meeting to discuss next steps.,37,,
164,0.97,1473.471,1474.272,"Aye, please continue.",37,,
165,0.97,1474.272,1484.015,The third item that we did not analyze was the policies related to fossil fuel facilities and public health.,38,,
166,0.97,1484.015,1519.751,"At the time this was docketed, it was not a recommendation and however, the approach has been in the fall and this item is important to issue a policy to explore and not something that was aligned with the Workplan or staff capacity to take on and is again something that we would propose to pick up in the major update.",38,,
167,0.97,1519.751,1567.899,"The fourth item here, 130Th Street considering designation of a new urban village around the plant light rail station at 130 of Ni-5 . We do have a process that is ongoing to develop a stationary plan that will consider that designation of this location for today as not a process that has completed far enough along to bring that particular issue and recommendation on the designation so that work is ongoing and as we talked about next year, I will have more to share about how we envisioned this process proceeding for the 2021 amendment.",38,,
168,0.97,1567.899,1584.382,"Finally, the designation had a request to evaluate health South Park alliance with criteria for a designation and consider whether any recommendations flow from that.",38,,
169,0.97,1584.382,1621.386,"Again, with several of these, we understand this to be a question that is much better brought up in the context of a comprehensive review across the city and how they align with current criteria and to make recommendations in a more comprehensive way rather than looking at one urban village in isolation and such a change would involve public engagement and we would want to ensure we have capacity to take on in looking at South park.",38,,
170,0.97,1626.558,1630.462,I believe there is a question from the Councilmember.,38,,
171,0.97,1630.462,1630.862,There is.,39,,
172,0.97,1630.862,1631.529,Go ahead.,39,,
173,0.97,1631.529,1634.366,Thank you.,40,,
174,0.97,1634.366,1644.876,"On this last bullet just for historical purposes, could you remind us how long the folks in South Park have been asking for an urban village designation?",40,,
175,0.97,1644.876,1669.1,I met with a number of Elders and families in the area who specifically had concerns about the lack of affordable housing and desire to make sure there was housing two or three or four bedroom so that more people could live and work in that area without having to commute in long distances.,40,,
176,0.97,1669.1,1678.943,Especially given the concerns that I'm hearing as well about traffic speeding to the area and wanted to make it a more Walkable neighborhood.,40,,
177,0.97,1678.943,1685.817,Can you remind us how long the folks have been asking about this and how they have already been engaged?,40,,
178,0.97,1685.817,1688.987,"Michael, if that is a question for you.",40,,
179,0.97,1688.987,1694.292,I think one clarifying point is that South Park currently is urban village.,41,,
180,0.97,1694.292,1704.502,It's not a question of designating it as an urban village but whether it should continue to be an urban village.,41,,
181,0.97,1704.502,1706.638,"Okay, I misunderstood the comment.",42,,
182,0.97,1706.638,1722.12,I thought what folks were asking for with a large coalition I met with was the ability to have greater housing Mixed-Use options to potentially expand it.,42,,
183,0.97,1722.12,1723.121,Is that not the question?,42,,
184,0.97,1723.121,1729.627,Is someone asking to downsize it?,42,,
185,0.97,1729.627,1753.985,"This not being an issue, we haven't done any targeted public engagement around and I can't really answer the question as to the Stakeholders you've heard from and if they are asking in regard to the urban village but the issues you raise are certainly ones we would be interested in addressing as an urban village.",43,,
186,0.97,1753.985,1780.545,"So, as we take on a review of the urban villages including South Park, we will certainly follow up on the kinds of questions that you raised but currently, this is urban village and our understanding of the Docketing items is to study how this urban village comparison the criteria in the comprehensive plan and whether the designation is still appropriate.",43,,
187,0.97,1780.545,1785.083,That is how we understood the document item.,43,,
188,0.97,1785.083,1790.989,Did you have something to add to that?,44,,
189,0.97,1790.989,1812.443,"Yes, this came out of mandatory housing Affordability process and some of the residents of South Park who saw the of sounds in our neighborhood as part of that process were concerned and asked that they be Reassessed to determine whether or not they met the criteria for urban village.",45,,
190,0.97,1812.443,1821.653,The proposal from some members of the community was to De- designate their village.,45,,
191,0.97,1821.653,1828.326,"Okay, I will be very interested in following up with that given the conversations I had with folks that live and work in the area.",46,,
192,0.97,1828.326,1838.436,I know there is a lot of interest in creating greater affordable housing and more Mixed-Use and mixed income opportunities.,46,,
193,0.97,1838.436,1839.737,"If that is to be docketed, Mr.",46,,
194,0.97,1839.737,1843.575,"Chair, thank you for fighting for me the appropriate time to engage in.",46,,
195,0.97,1843.575,1850.682,"Great, let's follow up with the staff and Opcd.",47,,
196,0.97,1850.682,1869.767,Thank you for allowing me to walk to the issues and I think it is important to understand the context but I will turn this over to Jim Holmes in terms of the recommendation for action.,48,,
197,0.97,1869.767,1883.381,The first condition for adoption is the moment to the future land use map that would expand the boundaries of the West Seattle urban village to include the campus of Providence Mount St. Vincent.,49,,
198,0.97,1883.381,1898.997,This is social service organizations was senior assisted living and skilled nursing care and health services and social services for the elderly in the community as well as Intergenerational Daycare.,49,,
199,0.97,1898.997,1909.807,Is currently zoned Lr three and within the West Seattle urban village would be to allow heights of up to 50 feet.,49,,
200,0.97,1909.807,1917.115,The limit is 40 feet and increase permitted fir from a .8 to 2.3.,49,,
201,0.97,1917.115,1931.329,They anticipate Redeveloping the site with the same uses but updated and possible expansion and that is why they are seeking this amendment.,49,,
202,0.97,1931.329,1943.675,Admits the goals for help urban village with Mixed-Use and Walkable communities so that is the basis of our recommendation.,49,,
203,0.97,1943.675,1948.212,We are also recommending a set of goals and policies for the neighborhood plan.,49,,
204,0.97,1948.212,1963.027,These policies were developed as part of the action plan process which involved rigorous community engagement and offers specific recommendations for improvements in the neighborhood.,49,,
205,0.97,1963.027,1992.256,These goals and policies will support the first engaged communities and they want to support dynamic destinations to have access that affordable healthy Foods and active transportation choices and policies that promote a healthy Creek Basin and advocating for parks and cultural facilities to support a healthy community.,49,,
206,0.97,1992.256,2015.48,The Mmf that we studied that we are not recommended for adoption is an amendment with the future land use map to the North center and the reasons for not recommending this amendment is it is a relatively small amount of land that would be added to the urban center and is fairly distant from high- capacity transit or frequent transit.,49,,
207,0.97,2015.48,2033.765,"Because of its size, we think if an expansion North in this area is to be considered that we should look at the whole block to make sure there is adequate infrastructure which has been a concern in the past to handle increased density.",49,,
208,0.97,2033.765,2041.606,That is the end of our recommendations.,49,,
209,0.97,2041.606,2051.582,"Thank you, Eric, Jim, Michael, Vice-Chair Mosqueda, I see you have a question.",50,,
210,0.97,2051.582,2054.385,I will defer.,51,,
211,0.97,2054.385,2058.89,Fair.,52,,
212,0.97,2058.89,2059.791,"Councilmember Lewis, take it away.",52,,
213,0.97,2059.791,2067.799,Thank you so much and I appreciate this presentation on the comprehensive plan changes.,53,,
214,0.97,2067.799,2081.212,I wanted to circle back and talk a little bit more about this stuff without impact of the components of this.,53,,
215,0.97,2081.212,2095.026,"I do feel and I think that number of my colleagues on the Council do as well that is so many other jurisdictions have impact fees, this is certainly something we can continue to keep working into.",53,,
216,0.97,2095.026,2119.217,What I am particularly interested in is looking at how impact fees could dovetail with some of the long ignored infrastructure improvements that can come along with growth and particularly vision zero related infrastructure to protect bike lanes and traffic comments measures.,53,,
217,0.97,2119.217,2128.359,Things I continue to fight for scarce and limited resources and in a lot of cases will be added capacity since we are so far behind.,53,,
218,0.97,2128.359,2185.716,"Of course in North Seattle, not my district but in North Seattle, sidewalks could potentially be something and I just wanted to throw out if we get a summary of where we are because my understanding is that it is still stalled in squaring circles in the process so that we can go forward on this and it was sent back by the hearing Examiner and I would be interested in figuring out if we can't move them forward in the cycle for comprehensive plan amendments, what kind of work we could do to keep moving forward and make sure we are making all of our downs in that process and keeping it alive as part of the infrastructure.",53,,
219,0.97,2185.716,2212.443,"As Michael noted, the Council got a decision about a year ago which returned to the Council for analyzing comprehensive plan amendments that would be a preliminary step necessary but not sufficient for the program.",54,,
220,0.97,2212.443,2242.473,"As the committee members know with the renewal, Councilmembers talked about an alternative impact for the Pathway based on the authority that the Tpd has and that is slightly different--more than slightly, an Analytical approach and has the ability to fund things that some can't fund such as service.",54,,
221,0.97,2242.473,2260.524,The Council is so much further along and can begin work assuming that the Council agrees on a project list because that is what the comprehensive plan amendment would do to have project list that would be eligible for expenditures.,54,,
222,0.97,2260.524,2271.102,"If the Council is interested in looking at an alternative that could include Tpd, there is probably more Analytical work that needs to happen.",54,,
223,0.97,2271.102,2281.512,"There is more Analytical work that needs to happen in either case but for the authorized impact, there are still some questions we need to answer.",54,,
224,0.97,2281.512,2285.816,If I could Chime in quickly?,55,,
225,0.97,2285.816,2290.021,"Yes, please, Councilmember Juarez.",56,,
226,0.97,2290.021,2307.004,I am watching and I do want to thank you and I should say I have been in the Loop on the development regarding the 1/30 station and well over 2000 units that will come for affordable housing and the training center.,57,,
227,0.97,2307.004,2315.212,We have all of our episodes and I think two years ago and we were happy with that.,57,,
228,0.97,2315.212,2334.131,I think we asked for 22 and got 19 of them and then we worked with the Mayor's office and the office of housing to purchase a ton of land for low income housing and I think it was like 20 acres.,57,,
229,0.97,2334.131,2342.873,"It is already low income so that when we build up, those same folks will move back in.",57,,
230,0.97,2342.873,2372.703,"I have been kind of silent because I know all this but I wanted to Chime in so the public knows we have a very active and especially since I sit on the transit, I am aware of the zoning that we have been doing and the one in Northgate and the wound 1/30.",57,,
231,0.97,2372.703,2378.409,"Thank you, Councilmembers regarding sidewalks.",57,,
232,0.97,2378.409,2410.307,"That will always be an issue in the North end and at one time, we were looking at different cities about not having adequate sidewalks and we figured out that it would be over--it was up in the billions of foot it would cost to provide sidewalks and not just at the District side but the North and.",57,,
233,0.97,2410.307,2418.649,May beginning to Federal law and that is still an issue in an area we target.,57,,
234,0.97,2418.649,2438.135,Working on public schools when we had the elementary schools come Online to make sure we had great curves and I appreciate the comment about the sidewalks up North and it is the whole North end.,57,,
235,0.97,2438.135,2464.295,The reason you hear more is that they did not come until the 60 so that is still an issue but we have been focusing the last four or five years on transit housing and development and anything we could get in front of and I want to go back to an issue that Vice-Chair Mosqueda brought up.,57,,
236,0.97,2464.295,2469.6,We really do need to look at language and what Single- family zoning needs.,57,,
237,0.97,2469.6,2509.773,"It really is full of or a byproduct from long ago that was for what a particular family is supposed to look like and be like and I do agree that at some point that if you Google the term what that means and we read that when we were looking about what Single- family zoning meant and I have said before if you want to change behavior, you have to change the language so I'm a big proponent not just because it is cosmetic but because it goes to the families that are not just single-family.",57,,
238,0.97,2509.773,2516.947,We now that families include extended family and particularly now we take care of our Elders that live with us.,57,,
239,0.97,2516.947,2525.756,We take care of our own children and extended family and I want to thank Vice-Chair Mosqueda for that point.,57,,
240,0.97,2525.756,2541.839,"Everything else, I want to thank you guys for the work you have done and hang attention and looking at the information you have provided so thank you.",57,,
241,0.97,2541.839,2550.648,"Councilmember Lewis, is that in response--I did see Councilmember Pedersen just ahead of you.",58,,
242,0.97,2550.648,2551.482,"Sorry, Mr. chair.",59,,
243,0.97,2551.482,2559.99,I had a couple of follow-up questions from the previous conversation if I could just get some clarification first.,59,,
244,0.97,2559.99,2601.432,"I wanted to talk a little bit because you mentioned and I'm glad you brought up, the two different authorities with the Seattle benefit and the Gma for greater impact these and I want to make sure that for the committee and the viewing public that we clarify because my understanding is is are not mutually exclusive authorities and that we could develop both of them and there could be advantages to that since they can be assessed on different types of development and used as projects and for both of them, there is a certain Analytical prerequisite as you lay them out.",59,,
245,0.97,2601.432,2618.983,The only reason I want to bring that up to get clarification is I wouldn't want us to not continue to pursue the Gma through the comprehensive plan process because we are also expecting to develop and pursue the transportation benefit district options.,59,,
246,0.97,2618.983,2647.211,I would want to make sure that we are doing the work we need to do to develop both options and to be able to mix and match and assess based on different projects and needs so I just wanted to throw that out there to give you a chance to clarify that a little and to sort of guide what we might do in this comprehensive plan process here to be able to knock out some of the prerequisites on the Gma options.,59,,
247,0.97,2647.211,2654.652,Thank you for the chance to Contextualize a little bit.,60,,
248,0.97,2654.652,2660.891,"For authorized impact fees, we don't have much to go on here by way of person in the state of Washington.",60,,
249,0.97,2660.891,2674.371,"There is authority and the Rcw but to my knowledge, no one has used that authority so we need to look to guidance to see what they have done.",60,,
250,0.97,2674.371,2694.425,I know California has similar authority when it comes to jurisdiction and it is a little unclear of what the procedural requirements would be for setting up the authorized impact program.,60,,
251,0.97,2694.425,2697.728,"Ambiguously, Gma will require amendments to the comprehensive plan.",60,,
252,0.97,2697.728,2707.037,That is a step that has to happen authorizing any sort of Gma based impact program.,60,,
253,0.97,2707.037,2714.645,Nativity authority references transportation plans but the city has a variety of transportation plans.,60,,
254,0.97,2714.645,2719.249,There is the comprehensive plan and then we have functional plans.,60,,
255,0.97,2719.249,2731.028,"We need to do internal work to figure out whether amendments would be required and on the face of it, maybe not.",60,,
256,0.97,2731.028,2736.066,We don't know for certain.,60,,
257,0.97,2736.066,2752.483,"For certain, the Gma authorized program would need a project list established in the comprehensive plan and the project list makes those projects eligible for expenditures if the program is established.",60,,
258,0.97,2752.483,2775.139,"There is more work to be done and in looking at what goes into the docket zoning resolution, the Council may want space for considering comprehensive plan amendments just to preserve that option and make sure persistently that the eyes are dotted and the teams are crossed.",60,,
259,0.97,2779.109,2783.013,Any follow-up?,61,,
260,0.97,2783.013,2786.583,I think I can follow-up Off- line you have additional questions.,62,,
261,0.97,2786.583,2787.084,Thank you.,62,,
262,0.97,2787.084,2790.521,"Great, thank you.",63,,
263,0.97,2790.521,2791.555,"Councilmember Pedersen, thank you for waiting.",63,,
264,0.97,2791.555,2793.991,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",64,,
265,0.97,2793.991,2809.84,I want to echo the sentiments of Councilmember Lewis on impact fees as a potential source of funding and to make sure we don't cut off any options and keep the door open on that.,64,,
266,0.97,2809.84,2825.656,"Looking to that guidance on what we need to do to keep both of those doors open one being the Gma path and the other being the Tbd path and for example, we are getting an audit on our bridges and that will be coming next week.",64,,
267,0.97,2825.656,2848.645,It is what I suspect it will show that there is a lot of deferred maintenance and I know to fix bridges is not necessary additive so that would be more of a transportation benefit district use of funds or as Gma I believe requires things to be more of additive nature to deal with the impacts.,64,,
268,0.97,2848.645,2859.189,I just want to keep echoing Councilmember Lewis and keep those doors open in that process of what you need to keep both doors open.,64,,
269,0.97,2859.189,2864.294,"Yeah, understood.",65,,
270,0.97,2864.294,2892.122,"We can discuss what needs to go into the resolution and run it past loss of those options are preserved as you correctly point out, the user for capacity related improvements can't be used for things like transit service or purchasing rolling stock so they are both authorities to purchase both different things.",65,,
271,0.97,2892.122,2896.126,Thank you.,66,,
272,0.97,2896.126,2896.927,Thank you.,67,,
273,0.97,2896.927,2903.3,"Vice-Chair Mosqueda, do you have questions you would like to ask?",67,,
274,0.97,2903.3,2904.501,Thank you very much.,68,,
275,0.97,2904.501,2948.478,First I just want to say how much I appreciate the context that Councilmember Juarez added to the concern of winning on the single family zoning change and especially given the historical context and the studies that have been done and the current context we are did well right now we are the highest rate of people under 40 living with a parent need to think about how we have more inclusive options for families across the city and looking at the various age patterns of those that are needing to live in the city and I do have a question about the planning Commission.,68,,
276,0.97,2948.478,2969.8,"If this is for Michael or anyone else on the line, can you talk about the recommendations with the changes that we made this year or did they have any comments?",68,,
277,0.97,2969.8,2972.402,"Thank you, Vice-Chair Mosqueda.",69,,
278,0.97,2972.402,3002.599,"I'm the executive Commissioner of the planning Commission and in terms of the recommendations for last year's document items, we did in her letter of her condition call attention to the proposed amendments that were not docketed last year what at actually do include Renaming single family as well as impact fees and others.",69,,
279,0.97,3002.599,3012.009,We definitely support the for their study of those and I appreciate your comments and that of other Councilmembers regarding the Renaming of single-family.,69,,
280,0.97,3012.009,3029.025,That is something the Commission recommended in our neighborhoods and continue to support and we do have concerns about waiting until the 2024 major update to address this issue as well as a number of others.,69,,
281,0.97,3029.025,3029.826,"Thank you, Vanessa.",70,,
282,0.97,3029.826,3033.43,I'm sorry I did not see you there earlier.,70,,
283,0.97,3033.43,3034.865,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",70,,
284,0.97,3034.865,3041.772,Thank you.,71,,
285,0.97,3041.772,3056.186,The questions that I had have already been asked by my colleagues so it seems we are working well in collaboration to address the issues before us.,71,,
286,0.97,3056.186,3064.194,"If there are no further questions from my colleagues, we will open the public hearing.",71,,
287,0.97,3064.194,3085.282,"Seeing none, before we open the public hearing, I would ask everyone be patient as we continue to get through the growing pains and are continuously looking for ways to Fine-Tune the process and adding new features that allow for participation.",71,,

342,0.97,3541.104,3570.867,"As you have heard, the plan can be amended once a year and in order to coordinate potential amendments to the comprehensive plan, the Council has set out a resolution that includes an annual process for reviewing that amendment and criteria for considering which amendment has a deeper study and potential analysis.",88,,
343,0.97,3570.867,3582.512,You are here today as part of the 2020-2021 comprehensive plan amendment process.,88,,
344,0.97,3582.512,3591.421,"Based on discussion, we will draft a resolution for consideration at the next meeting.",88,,
345,0.97,3591.421,3612.408,The Council for an open call for potential amendments every year and this year we received 11 proposals for members of the public and we have a number of other amendments that have been adopted in previous years and are pending evaluation.,88,,
346,0.97,3612.408,3624.153,"At this stage, the proposed amendments study based on criteria's the Council has previously adopted.",88,,
347,0.97,3624.153,3637.767,This is not a determination of whether or not you agree with the policy direction but rather whether it meets the criteria in the resolution.,88,,
348,0.97,3637.767,3645.274,I will share my screen.,88,,
349,0.97,3645.274,3653.783,"To walk through those amendments, these can be found at the end of the staff memo that we have prepared on this item.",88,,
350,0.97,3653.783,3659.689,It's the very last page of the letter to the Council.,88,,
351,0.97,3659.689,3681.21,"Very briefly, the criteria as well the amendment would be legal under state and local law and whether it is appropriate for the comprehensive plan or practical including whether there is time to do the necessary review and analysis including environmental review.",88,,
352,0.97,3681.21,3699.328,"If an amendment has previously been proposed and not docketed or considered and rejected, we ask that the proponent identify that the circumstances have changed significantly.",88,,
353,0.97,3699.328,3738.134,"If in America changes the plan, we ask that there be outreach to the neighborhood and we want to make sure the amendment is likely to make a difference in city regulations or funding and that amendment would change the boundary of the urban village and it definitely requires review but if it would instead just amend the land use map, there is a threshold that we use.",88,,
354,0.97,3738.134,3748.478,Any questions on the criteria before we dive into what the amendments have been proposed?,88,,
355,0.97,3748.478,3751.748,I am not seen questions from my colleagues.,89,,
356,0.97,3751.748,3757.186,Great.,90,,
357,0.97,3757.186,3781.777,"So, we have 11 amendments proposed by members of the public and the first is environment to the future land use map and the boundaries of the University urban center along 15th Avenue between northeast 56 Street and half a block is proposed to be added to the urban center.",90,,
358,0.97,3781.777,3792.922,The planning Commission and central staff all recommend Docketing this item.,90,,
359,0.97,3792.922,3809.405,"I believe you just mentioned this but now that we have this chart before us, can you explain the difference between the three sets of recommendations and the planning Commission and central staff?",91,,
360,0.97,3809.405,3813.075,"I believe you just mentioned it but with this before us, it would be helpful to hear once more.",91,,
361,0.97,3813.075,3829.959,"Yeah, each group has reviewed the amendment proposals and there are a couple that were submitted by departments for Councilmembers that were not distributed to all three parties.",92,,
362,0.97,3829.959,3840.703,"Attached to the staff memo, you have members from the planning Commission that include recommendations.",92,,
363,0.97,3840.703,3844.173,We lost your Audio there.,93,,
364,0.97,3854.417,3857.987,Can you hear me?,94,,
365,0.97,3857.987,3864.393,"There we are, loud and clear.",95,,
366,0.97,3864.393,3866.128,Thank you.,95,,
367,0.97,3882.845,3884.113,Can you hear me now?,96,,
368,0.97,3884.113,3885.014,Even better.,97,,
369,0.97,3885.014,3885.615,Great.,98,,
370,0.97,3885.615,3902.531,You have letters from the planning Commission and the staff memo and the planning Commission and Opcd are available for comments if you have questions about recommendations.,98,,
371,0.97,3902.531,3909.839,"After I run to this table, there will be a short discussion of the regulations.",98,,
372,0.97,3909.839,3910.806,"Excellent, thank you.",99,,
373,0.97,3910.806,3935.164,The next set of amendment is one of the few where there is difference of opinion and that Barker has proposed a plan be reviewed to look at whether there are changes to be made based on the closure of the West Seattle bridge.,100,,
374,0.97,3935.164,3978.074,Most of the recommendations were focused on Land-Use elements and changes to slow growth based on the impact of the bridge closure and central staff recommends that you look at this amendment but focuses on whether there are changes to the transportation element that are necessitated by the closure of the bridge and particularly maps on transit routes that should be updated to reflect the bridge closure.,100,,
375,0.97,3978.074,3995.291,The next amendment is from James and asks that the plans be amended for potential inside area and these covenants are creatures of the drainage code.,100,,
376,0.97,3995.291,4011.14,May indemnify the city against potential impacts from landslides based on development and potential Landside areas.,100,,
377,0.97,4011.14,4016.145,We do not recommend Docketig this item.,100,,
378,0.97,4016.145,4018.647,It is not a comprehensive plan issue.,100,,
379,0.97,4018.647,4026.155,The next eight amendments all are recommended not to move forward for the same reason.,100,,
380,0.97,4026.155,4040.202,The Council has previously received these amendments and decided not to docket them or has reviewed them and proposed not to move forward with the proposed amendment.,100,,
381,0.97,4040.202,4047.676,The Proposers for each of these items have not shown that there has been a change in circumstances since they were last reviewed.,100,,
382,0.97,4047.676,4070.466,"They do not meet the criteria in the Council's resolution and if the proponents do show that there is a change in circumstances or change to the proposal and send my to better address and meet the criteria of the comprehensive plan, the Council could consider these in future years.",100,,
383,0.97,4070.466,4094.19,"As was discussed during the previous item, there are a number of issues that were included in previous years Docketing resolutions that have not yet been resolved and since they received fairly Hardy discussion, I will run through them to remind you what they are.",100,,
384,0.97,4094.19,4100.696,Impact fee amendments and Aternative single-family areas and is a nation of South Park urban village.,100,,
385,0.97,4100.696,4129.158,Status new urban village at 30th Street and amendment related to public health with the planning Commission and several staff recommend to keep them on the document and Opcd recommend that they not be documented at this time because they will take more time than is available for an amendment to be considered next year.,100,,
386,0.97,4129.158,4135.965,"Finally, we have three new amendments proposed by Councilmembers and city departments.",100,,
387,0.97,4135.965,4161.857,Chair Strauss has asked that the docket included item related to trees and that we review the work that is currently underway related to trees in partnership with the Commission and identify whether there are changes to the appropriate forum for the comprehensive plan coming out of that work.,100,,
388,0.97,4161.857,4176.305,They are Regretting not documenting urban village designation at 430Th because that work will not be completed next year.,100,,
389,0.97,4176.305,4187.449,They are recommending or suggesting that there may be some targeted changes to get ready for Council review next year.,100,,
390,0.97,4187.449,4191.72,"Finally, it looks like it dropped off.",100,,
391,0.97,4191.72,4224.62,There is one more related to manufacturing and industrial centers and that one comes out of work that has been docketed in the past and the Mayor has convened industrial task force to look into those areas and that is meeting and may have preliminary recommendations coming out of that work.,100,,
392,0.97,4224.62,4234.163,"So, Opcd is suggesting to add that to the docket.",100,,
393,0.97,4234.163,4235.764,Any questions before hand it over to Opcd?,100,,
394,0.97,4235.764,4238.834,Let's check with our colleagues.,101,,
395,0.97,4238.834,4239.435,We have Councilmember Lewis.,101,,
396,0.97,4239.435,4241.07,Please take it away.,101,,
397,0.97,4241.07,4263.025,"Going back to that last on the industrial land being added to the docket, what is the implication of having that added to the docket in advance of any of the specific recommendations for even preliminary ones coming out of the industrial lands and Stakeholders?",102,,
398,0.97,4263.025,4267.062,What would the application be to include them in this?,102,,
399,0.97,4267.062,4276.872,"So, the reason why we have the docket is because of the growth management act that requires early and ongoing public involvement.",103,,
400,0.97,4276.872,4295.491,The Docketing process provides a heads up to members of the public that there could be changes being made in broad areas related to the comprehensive plan with a map of amendments.,103,,
401,0.97,4295.491,4315.711,"If it is added to the docket, it will be incumbent on Opcd to do outreach and since it is not docketed, they would be a higher threshold for the Council to consider changes that would come out of that work.",103,,
402,0.97,4315.711,4338.367,It is not a hard and fast know if the Department recommends changes that were not documented but it requires more or we would ask for more indication that members of the public were aware of the changes to have opportunity to be involved.,103,,
403,0.97,4338.367,4348.077,We are essentially providing notice because we anticipate that there will be recommendations and information that come out of the Stakeholder process?,104,,
404,0.97,4348.077,4351.647,Thank you.,104,,
405,0.97,4351.647,4352.381,Councilmember Pedersen.,105,,
406,0.97,4352.381,4354.983,Thank you.,106,,
407,0.97,4354.983,4366.195,Could you go back to item 1 or I think it was the first item.,106,,
408,0.97,4366.195,4375.671,Item one is in city council district four that I represent and I'm very familiar with that block.,106,,
409,0.97,4375.671,4416.145,"Thank you for speaking to the process to answer Councilmember Lewis's question because that Alleviates concern I have not this is just the beginning of the process in which there will be additional input because from looking at the map, it looks like a logical place to have additional density and there are single-family homes and also older apartment buildings with affordable housing as well on half of that block so I would be curious as to what the input would be.",106,,
410,0.97,4416.145,4423.252,Do you happen to know why it was not included and tell us more about the proposal.,106,,
411,0.97,4423.252,4432.161,Do we know more about the Proposer?,106,,
412,0.97,4432.161,4447.776,I don't know but Katie Kendall is a Land-Use attorney who submits amendment proposals.,107,,
413,0.97,4447.776,4464.092,The area was included in Scoping documents for additional potential changes to the University district zoning that came out of the mandatory housing Affordability process.,107,,
414,0.97,4464.092,4479.308,This area is currently zoned Lr 323 without a mandatory housing Affordability requirements.,107,,
415,0.97,4479.308,4493.121,That work is moving very slowly and the proponents of this amendment would like to see changes happen more quickly on this half block.,107,,
416,0.97,4493.121,4506.535,Additional analysis would be performed on the impacts of this change prior to it coming back to the Council.,107,,
417,0.97,4506.535,4511.206,"In your view, it meets all the criteria to be docketed?",108,,
418,0.97,4511.206,4511.64,Correct.,109,,
419,0.97,4511.64,4516.111,"The discussion about whether to approve it, the substance of that would happen later?",110,,
420,0.97,4516.111,4519.948,Correct.,111,,
421,0.97,4519.948,4524.086,"Once the review is performed, performed . outreach is",111,,
422,0.97,4524.086,4528.69,"Okay, thank you.",112,,
423,0.97,4533.896,4541.67,Any further questions from my colleagues?,113,,
424,0.97,4541.67,4547.976,"Seeing none, Opcd, are you ready to present?",113,,
425,0.97,4547.976,4548.577,"Yes, we are.",114,,
426,0.97,4548.577,4550.579,"Thank you, chair.",114,,
427,0.97,4550.579,4558.353,"Again, Michael Hubner to invite Jim Holmes that leads up the annual amendment process.",114,,
428,0.97,4558.353,4562.19,"Next slide, please.",114,,
429,0.97,4562.19,4617.679,Very briefly I want to thank you for covering a lot that we were going to cover and in summarizing the recommendations and in particular we will provide a bit more information on the executive proposals on the Maritime amendments we will be looking at but we will provide an overview of the comprehensive plan amendment that was proposed by the community that we are recommending for Docketing the amendment application but we are not recommending and we consider them to be modified proposals based on prior docketed items with 1/30 and industrial Maritime on than three proposals identified in earlier Council resolutions that we are not recommending.,114,,
430,0.97,4617.679,4629.758,We will run through each of those categories and I will turn it over to Jim to lead off on several of these items.,114,,
431,0.97,4629.758,4650.178,"One of the proposals is to amend the future land use map to include the half block funding northeast and we are recommending that the docketed and I will not Belabor the point, I think we just discussed that quite a bit but that is the only committee proposed amendment we are recommending for documenting.",115,,
432,0.97,4650.178,4661.79,We are not recommending Docketing with the number of applications because they were previously docketed or considered by the city council.,115,,
433,0.97,4661.79,4680.809,Also relating to heavy vehicles and separation and resumes and conditional uses to develop monitoring and we are not recommending that it was submitted this year for the first time.,115,,
434,0.97,4680.809,4711.64,One is potential inside area covenants because that is more appropriately addressed in the municipal code and in the West Seattle bridge proposal which involved a number of actions having to do with Land-Use and transportation and we are deferring to this process which is very rigorous to identify short-term and long-term strategies to manage or mitigate the impacts of the closure.,115,,
435,0.97,4711.64,4720.315,As well as identify neighborhood proposed transportation improvements and we feel that is the more appropriate course of action to take.,115,,
436,0.97,4720.315,4740.135,We have been talking about amendments identified in previous resolutions and at first I will start with what we are not recommending for Docketing with impact fees and single-family zoning names and South Park urban village.,115,,
437,0.97,4740.135,4762.891,"For all the reasons we discussed in the early agenda item, we are recommending two modified--we have two modified recommendations and when regarding 130Th Street station urban village and one that has to do with industrial land use policy.",115,,
438,0.97,4762.891,4764.292,Michael will talk about 1/30 street.,115,,
439,0.97,4764.292,4766.361,"Thank you, Jim.",116,,
440,0.97,4766.361,4772.2,Let me provide some context and explain what the proposed approach is.,116,,
441,0.97,4772.2,4836.364,"As I described briefly in the previous agenda item, we had a stationary planning process ongoing for over a year around not only the plans 130Th station but also 145Th Street station just a short bit to the North at that location along I- 5. this process is ongoing and with the closures, there has been am slow down in that process and the ability to do community engagement but we are getting back to it and adopting new and creative approaches and we are not alone obviously in the city in working with community around issues that have begun and we are doing some Online information sessions to move the process along.",116,,
442,0.97,4836.364,4869.798,We are very cognizant of the decision-making process and the apple program and the potential timing of bringing the station Online but very committed to planning for development but Famously focusing on having a robust community involved planning process to ground that in.,116,,
443,0.97,4869.798,4883.111,The planning area potentially for the urban village designation is roughly a Half- mile around the station.,116,,
444,0.97,4883.111,4910.338,There are Land-Use concepts as well as policy issues and community needs ranging from housing and open space and mobility and transportation in that neighborhood and concerns around critical areas and a number of issues have come up through the process.,116,,
445,0.97,4910.338,4931.259,"As that process moves forward, the question of should this location be urban village will be one of the questions that will evaluate that is right for the Council to pick up recommendations specifically.",116,,
446,0.97,4931.259,4949.144,"However, that process while we expect by the end of the year, we will be well along towards having a draft plan or vision for the station area and a draft of that plan moving through this process.",116,,
447,0.97,4949.144,4982.877,We don't anticipate that we will have time for the more rigorous zoning analysis and environmental review to bring back the Land-Use in time for the 2021 amendments to the comprehensive plan which we anticipate we would bring recommendations to you so it's really not enough time to take on the full station area in that Timeframe.,116,,
448,0.97,4982.877,5024.452,"However, Opcd and the city is very committed and would you think it is reasonable based on the work being done to bring a more targeted recommendation for Land-Use changes for the one block that is immediately to the East and this would be an intern action which would involve amending the future land use map and it may also entail language changes to existing policies to facilitate and accommodate development in this location.",116,,
449,0.97,5024.452,5041.736,The one block contains about eight acres and is predominantly single-family at this time and there is also a major potential opportunity with the church property with parking and single-family homes.,116,,
450,0.97,5041.736,5051.179,There are opportunities to discuss potential transit support and development immediately adjacent to the station.,116,,
451,0.97,5051.179,5057.385,We think that is a good thing to pursue and can be done with the 2021 amendments.,116,,
452,0.97,5057.385,5098.56,"Community engagement will continue through the fall and early 2021 and very much grounded in community engagement and for the larger area, while we don't have a certain Timeframe for bringing the Land- use changes for the full walk shed, it could likely be accommodated either in the subsequent years annual amendment either 2022 or 2023 or quite possibly in the major update to the comprehensive plan along the designation should you be recommending that.",116,,
453,0.97,5102.63,5110.238,I will pause there if there any questions since I just shared a bit of information with you.,116,,
454,0.97,5110.238,5111.84,I am happy to take any questions.,116,,
455,0.97,5111.84,5115.31,"Thank you, Michael.",117,,
456,0.97,5115.31,5117.545,Councilmember Juarez's comments earlier were very instructive as well.,117,,
457,0.97,5117.545,5124.452,"Colleagues, any questions?",117,,
458,0.97,5124.452,5125.653,Not seeing any at this time.,117,,
459,0.97,5125.653,5126.054,Thank you.,117,,
460,0.97,5126.054,5131.559,"Great, I will turn to Jim to talk about the a Maritime strategy and what we might bring for the 2021 action on the content.",118,,
461,0.97,5131.559,5158.186,"Yes, last year the Mayor appointed a Stakeholder group and Subarea groups to work on developing a Maritime strategy and while we are talking about Land-Use today, it's worth noting that the strategy is not just Land-Use but addresses Land-Use and workforce training and environmental issues and transportation and public safety.",119,,
462,0.97,5158.186,5176.804,It is a cohesive approach and this process we anticipated having some policies ready to look at this year and Covid-19 pause that process but we are restarting that in the fall.,119,,
463,0.97,5176.804,5183.711,We anticipate having preliminary Land-Use recommendations or policy recommendations in 2021.,119,,
464,0.97,5183.711,5197.525,These would help provide a policy framework and make a lot of the decisions that are facing the city such as what happens around transit stations and the Stadium district and Armory site.,119,,
465,0.97,5197.525,5200.628,We wanted to create a cohesive platform for those decisions.,119,,
466,0.97,5200.628,5221.549,The Land-Use policy we hope to have before you in 2021 with the additional implantation steps including and loose maps and regulations to be undertaken in 2022 or possibly during the major update to the comprehensive plan.,119,,
467,0.97,5221.549,5223.384,That would be in 2024.,119,,
468,0.97,5229.591,5231.459,"Michael, I think you are going to address this line?",119,,
469,0.97,5231.459,5235.163,I am.,120,,
470,0.97,5235.163,5239.1,"I'm just Messing with my microphone, apologies.",120,,
471,0.97,5239.1,5254.048,"Finally, we do want to highlight for you a couple of issues that are also contained in our memo to the committee for Docketing for this year.",120,,
472,0.97,5254.048,5309.304,These are more in the vein of for your information to let you know that Opcd is working on several issues that while we don't think they are right for putting it on the docket in terms of a specific proposal to acknowledge that there is a context of a priority and the city as a whole around recovery in light of the Covid-19 pandemic and the two areas of work that we think may as the work proceeds with some urgency to the fall and 320 21 that there may be additional executive proposals as appropriate to amend the plan and at least the first steps with two large concepts in response to Covid-19.,120,,
473,0.97,5309.304,5364.959,What is the racially equitable recovery for strategy and there are number of areas and in light of priorities around promoting community ownership and wealth building and affordable housing and even some of the work we are continuing around racial equity assessments and growth strategy Úand especially in light of the Disproportional impacts of the pandemic and the issues around systemic racism that it has heightened awareness around that there may indeed be a member proposals to come to you in early 2021 in time for inclusion and the amendments you would be considering.,120,,
474,0.97,5364.959,5403.931,There would certainly be a heightened emphasis on community engagement that the executive would pursue those issues in light of but really not business specific proposals and we just wanted to highlight that we are continuing to work in the area and the plan could help us to set a course for addressing systemic racism and recovery and 2021 could be a time that something could be brought to you.,120,,
475,0.97,5403.931,5433.995,"Similarly, the response to the pandemic and the ongoing emphasis on what many of us are experiencing around the importance of neighborhoods and accessibility with a range of goods and services and amenities have been relatively easy with accessibility where people are able to live throughout the city and that is of heightened importance to Opcd.",120,,
476,0.97,5433.995,5439.066,We are doing that work in terms of accessibility as well as some of the housing and Land- use implications.,120,,
477,0.97,5439.066,5489.016,There is a concept of the 50 minute city that some of you may be aware of and some other cities like Paris or Portland and a number of other cities are looking at the green recovery plan which was developed in the wake of the pandemic and identifies us as the recommended strategy that looks at the neighborhoods and with respect to having homes and Affordability levels located within an easy walk or bicycle distance to a full range that a person may have every single day.,120,,
478,0.97,5489.016,5508.469,"Jobs and businesses and services and public amenities in Healthcare and parks and education, the full range of daily needs and we are exploring this as a potential framework for addressing Land- use and community development in the comprehensive plan update.",120,,
479,0.97,5508.469,5519.313,It's very early thinking but there may be something that springs from this work that would lend itself to a preliminary amendment or amendments in 2021.,120,,
480,0.97,5519.313,5535.763,Just wanted to describe to you a couple of our teams that we are working on and give you a heads up to bring recommendations.,120,,
481,0.97,5535.763,5536.464,Vice-Chair Mosqueda?,121,,
482,0.97,5536.464,5538.966,Thank you very much.,122,,
483,0.97,5538.966,5542.503,Could you put that slide backup?,122,,
484,0.97,5542.503,5551.979,On the first bullet.,122,,
485,0.97,5551.979,5555.683,Racially equitable Covid-19 recovery.,122,,
486,0.97,5555.683,5561.856,Can you tell me more about what that means and who is invited to the table for developing these recommendations?,122,,
487,0.97,5561.856,5570.498,"So, this isn't one initiative.",123,,
488,0.97,5570.498,5596.557,"For the gravity of the site, this was a phrase that we felt would capture things that the city is looking at in terms of how we are addressing the recovery strategy in light of the racial inequities in terms of Covid-19 impacts and impacts of the economic impact and housing impact from the shutdown.",123,,
489,0.97,5596.557,5622.249,There isn't a specific process this is referring to but rather the work that Opcd is doing generally in responding to Covid-19 and addressing racial disparities which may result in a member proposals that the executive would bring forward next year.,123,,
490,0.97,5622.249,5644.038,"Mr. chair, I would like to flag the importance of this work and the importance of doing this urgently in 2020 which requires us to have a better understanding of what the policy objectives are here.",124,,
491,0.97,5644.038,5679.774,To put this on a slide is important and I appreciate you doing that because we shouldn't Miss the opportunity to say this to be front and center of all the conversations we are having in every committee but since it was included in the Powerpoint presentation and I'm still vague on what the process looks like and who is at the table for coming up with those recommendations and I'm happy to see it listed but I think some examples would be good and some policy objectives or at least categories and having a better understanding of who was involved in the process would be important.,124,,
492,0.97,5679.774,5702.329,I will also note that I think a part of our Jumpstart spending plan was centered on racial equity in the Covid-19 release strategy and so much of that is core to what the Council is interested in advancing and I'm happy to hear more from Opcd and other departments as it relates to what it looks like to have a recovery strategy that centers racial equity.,124,,
493,0.97,5702.329,5716.343,It is important to get more information on what exactly is being considered and who is doing that and would affirm Timeline looks like and some examples.,124,,
494,0.97,5716.343,5722.817,Noted and well said and I would also like to follow-up more on these issues.,125,,
495,0.97,5722.817,5738.766,"At the next committee or presentation of this bill, I think it will be important to hear more details about objectives and who is participating and what are the action steps being taken.",125,,
496,0.97,5751.612,5759.186,"Michael and Jim, any further presentation from you or colleagues any further questions from Opcd's presentation?",125,,
497,0.97,5759.186,5767.261,"Seeing and hearing none, Vanessa, did you have a presentation?",125,,
498,0.97,5767.261,5774.802,I am realizing it is not in my script.,125,,
499,0.97,5774.802,5776.07,I want to just check with you.,125,,
500,0.97,5776.07,5777.104,"Thank you, chair.",126,,
501,0.97,5777.104,5781.942,I do not have a presentation but I'm happy to answer any questions you or other Council members may have regarding the recommendations.,126,,
502,0.97,5781.942,5783.177,Wonderful.,127,,
503,0.97,5783.177,5787.148,Any questions for the planning Commission?,127,,
504,0.97,5787.148,5816.076,"Seeing and hearing none, we will open the public hearing and I was reminded of my very strict public comment precedent that I had set at the beginning of this year and even the three song which I love so much, I had to give a verbal warning to because of the extended participation throughout Council chambers.",127,,
505,0.97,5816.076,5843.771,"What I would request from you, I see you are present and if you could submit any additional comments in writing for the record to reflect your comments and then I would be happy to meet with you virtually with staff to discuss any input that you would like to have me think about.",127,,
506,0.97,5843.771,5863.29,"So, before we begin, before we open the remote public hearing, I would ask that everyone please be patient as we continue to learn and operate this new system and navigate through the inevitable growing pains.",127,,
507,0.97,5863.29,5868.662,We are looking for ways to Fine- tune the process and add features that allow for additional means of public participation.,127,,
508,0.97,5868.662,5870.497,I will moderate the public hearing in the following manner.,127,,
509,0.97,5870.497,5879.473,Each Speaker will be given two minutes to speak and I will call on one Speaker at a time and in the order in which they are registered on the Website.,127,,
510,0.97,5879.473,5886.614,"If you have not registered to speak and you would like to, you can sign up before the end of the hearing by going to the Council's Website.",127,,
511,0.97,5886.614,5889.483,The link is also listed in today's agenda.,127,,
512,0.97,5889.483,5903.631,"Once a call Speaker's name, staff will Unmute the appropriate microphone and then it will be their turn to speak.",127,,
513,0.97,5903.631,5916.01,"Please begin by speaking by stating your name and the item you are addressing as reminder, your comments relate to the comprehensive plan Docketing and if you have comments about something not on this item or today's agenda, you can always provide written comments by Email my office.",127,,
514,0.97,5916.01,5930.991,"Speakers will hear a time when 10 seconds are left and then we ask you to begin to wrap up your public comments as you have 10 seconds left and if you do not and the comments, speakers microphone will be muted to allow the next Speaker.",127,,
515,0.97,5930.991,5954.782,"Also, remember that you must press Star 6 to Unmute yourself and what you have completed the public comment, we ask that you Disconnect from the line if you plan to continue following this meeting, please do so through the Channel or listening options and the public hearing is now open and we will begin with the first Speaker on the list.",127,,
516,0.97,5954.782,5961.288,"I have listed here today Maria however, you are listed is not present.",127,,
517,0.97,5961.288,5968.195,"We have Dave Morgan and Deb Barker, Chris Lehman and Richard Allison and the rest are present.",127,,

519,0.97,5975.302,5976.704,"David, please take it away.",127,,
520,0.97,5976.704,5982.71,Thank you Councilmembers.,128,,
521,0.97,5982.71,5998.692,"The reason I'm calling today is for the 2020-21, plan amendments that are proposed and recommended not to be pursued not to be docketed.",128,,
522,0.97,5998.692,6008.235,One of them I submitted was item number 11 for the tree canopy and item number five which is very similar.,128,,
523,0.97,6008.235,6013.741,I think the one that I submitted was also rejected two years in a row.,128,,
524,0.97,6013.741,6027.921,I think we all agree that the added density and added healthy tree canopy are required to fight the climate change.,128,,
525,0.97,6027.921,6029.356,The issues that we know of.,128,,
526,0.97,6029.356,6038.065,This is well documented in the tree canopy study that the city conducted and I encourage you all to take a look at that.,128,,
527,0.97,6038.065,6044.772,What is going on then with the content and how does it intend to address those issues?,128,,
528,0.97,6044.772,6053.747,"We know that Seattle's parks and 200,000 tree trees cannot get back canopy goal.",128,,
529,0.97,6053.747,6064.992,We also know that over two thirds of Seattle's tree Canopies are on private property.,128,,
530,0.97,6064.992,6072.933,"As we Densify the private property, that means the tree canopy will be greatly impacted.",128,,
531,0.97,6072.933,6086.013,"Therefore, if growth in Seattle excludes private property, there will not be a way to achieve the 30% canopy goal and the impact to the climate will be significant.",128,,
532,0.97,6086.013,6103.497,Look at the tree canopy where it is 10 or 13% compared to Dell ridge and the request may include this in the docket and that is to the for the tree canopy.,128,,
533,0.97,6103.497,6107.534,"Thank you, Dave.",129,,
534,0.97,6107.534,6115.209,Some of the thoughts that you just expressed is why I put forward an additional item to be docketed.,129,,
535,0.97,6115.209,6121.114,Up next is Deb Barker and then Chris Lehman.,129,,
536,0.97,6121.114,6121.548,"Dad, welcome back.",129,,
537,0.97,6121.548,6125.919,"Thank you so much, chair Strauss.",130,,
538,0.97,6125.919,6151.044,"Reading along, I direct your attention to the menus and neighborhood were in my central staff page 4 of six in the last paragraph considering whether changes to the comprehensive plan are merited due to significant impacts to the city's infrastructure is prudent or central staff.",130,,
539,0.97,6151.044,6164.858,I am Deb Barker and right after the shower in the time of the was in a Highbridge was closed because of potential cracks.,130,,
540,0.97,6164.858,6176.203,The closure of the critical transportation component mutely created uncharted neighborhood and transportation related impacts for a white area in the Southern portion of the city.,130,,
541,0.97,6176.203,6183.944,Please realize that thousands of people have been and will continue to be adversely impacted by the West Seattle bridge closure for a very long time.,130,,
542,0.97,6183.944,6205.132,"Because of these unknowns to the valley, I offered this comprehensive plan amendment and my goal was to help the city of Seattle mitigate the closure and my hope is that the amendment would enable methods of mitigation beyond the scope of what duty typically controls.",130,,
543,0.97,6205.132,6211.905,I consider this pandemic a Placeholder for future mitigation action.,130,,
544,0.97,6211.905,6222.316,"You may recall that the Mayor did not authorize proclamations until mid-July and today, they are still Fine-Tuning for litigation plans for the affected communities.",130,,
545,0.97,6222.316,6235.128,"Yesterday, they issued a Land- use decision for the West Seattle makes use junction with 44 parking stalls and that project has been in the pipeline for almost 3 years.",130,,
546,0.97,6235.128,6243.036,The decision does not even mention the closure and the traffic analysis is based on the bridge being open.,130,,
547,0.97,6243.036,6251.778,There is no discussion or mitigation for the additional vehicles driving over --,130,,
548,0.97,6251.778,6263.557,"Thank you, Deb for your comments and you can follow-up with the additional thoughts and we will be happy to receive those and reflect them in the record.",131,,
549,0.97,6263.557,6281.208,"Chris Lehman, you are next and I hope you heard my comments earlier of having a precedent set and if you would like to meet with me individually and submit written recommendations and written comments for public comment today, we would be happy to accept both.",131,,
550,0.97,6281.208,6289.983,"Currently, we have the public comment set at two minutes.",131,,
551,0.97,6289.983,6298.292,"Obviously, the five-minute offer is what I was relying on.",132,,
552,0.97,6298.292,6310.904,I have to mention five of the seven amendments and I did take you up on your offer and I hope you will have a fresh look at these things.,132,,
553,0.97,6310.904,6321.248,There are two that I will talk about and one is to establish the sections or Appendix in which the city would plan for open government.,132,,
554,0.97,6321.248,6336.663,"While my proposal offices best practices, this is something that the Mayor and Council accepted ownership of to engage with the public.",132,,
555,0.97,6336.663,6341.568,Your staff Unfortunately did not correctly inform you.,132,,
556,0.97,6341.568,6367.994,I didn't specifically say what had changed and what had changed is that the Coronavirus prices had shown that the city council does not have a plan and did not and does not have a plan but needs one and also needs to honor the 2008 resolution to establish such a plan.,132,,
557,0.97,6367.994,6389.116,I wish I had more time to talk about that and the other one is about the completely unacceptable and escalating damage to our roads and bridges by extra heavy vehicles which are owned or chartered by the city and the county.,132,,

580,0.97,6586.713,6607.834,The importance of that is that we have a slow problem today and this is not the first year where climate change happens in regards to change and yet it would seem as though they will find a way to work with trees.,138,,
581,0.97,6607.834,6633.259,They would stop housing if we On't change the way we protect trees and don't change the way that we allow buildings to be put in and that is to build taller around existing trees and not just having radical changes to it.,138,,

606,0.97,6804.898,6809.169,"Okay, I can do a quick summary and if there are more questions, I might bring them to you.",145,,
607,0.97,6809.169,6825.151,A quick summary of this legislation is Council the 19827 which would Rezone 2.72 acres in the Raynor Beach neighborhood to support affordable housing projects and is comprised of two areas.,145,,
608,0.97,6825.151,6841.0,There is one Rezone area just north of South rose Street and I might just see if I can pull up a map here.,145,,

610,0.97,6863.79,6864.224,"Sorry, technology.",145,,
611,0.97,6864.224,6865.391,"Yes, we can still see it.",146,,
612,0.97,6865.391,6876.603,"Okay, there is one area on the North side, kind of on the northern end that consists of one single large parcel zoned or three different zones on it.",147,,
613,0.97,6876.603,6889.182,Lr three with the mandatory housing Affordability suffix single-family 5000 and then a very small portion with that zone.,147,,
614,0.97,6889.182,6932.191,The proposal would Rezone this Lr three area to Mc 255 and the severe Rezone to Lrm and the other area is located within the Raynor Beach village on the Presidential urban village and that is three parcels that are currently zoned and they are proposed to be Rezoned to 60 5M 1. that is a quick summary.,147,,
615,0.97,6946.606,6952.145,Does anyone have any questions?,147,,
616,0.97,6952.145,6966.159,"Great, I do have a question for Jeff but I do know that Councilmember Mireles has joined us and this being her district, I would do for her before I asked my questions.",148,,
617,0.97,6966.159,6972.398,Thank you and good morning everyone.,149,,
618,0.97,6972.398,6977.904,Thank you chair Strauss for inviting me to come.,149,,
619,0.97,6977.904,6978.971,I don't have any questions.,149,,
620,0.97,6978.971,6983.209,I'm really just here to express my support for the proposed changes.,149,,
621,0.97,6983.209,7026.719,"You know, there was some thorough information provided to Councilmembers but I do want to say that as a legislative zone change, it really does Supprt the cities goals in terms of racial equity and goals we were just talking and I have a listing for a little while talking about the COMP plan and the important need to make sure that as we are moving forward with any Land-Use policy that we are centralized around equity but also meeting the strategic purpose of affordable housing and as you know, the Raynor Beach neighborhood is an area designated as low opportunities at high risk of displacement.",149,,
622,0.97,7026.719,7041.134,It is important that we are supporting projects that increase the goods and services that are available to try to shift that dial.,149,,
623,0.97,7041.134,7068.161,"These aren't Edi projects but it illustrates why that program is so important because there is a need for goods and services and when these projects are trying to get put into place, very often the organizations doing them have limited resources and it puts the project at risk if they can't get finances in place.",149,,
624,0.97,7068.161,7080.54,I'm happy to see that these projects are moving forward and the project specifically will provide important services and the food bank is critical right now.,149,,
625,0.97,7080.54,7102.829,Food security in South Seattle has grown tremendously and food insecurity and especially in light of Covid-19 and then the housing projects and the northern end of the area will provide much-needed housing and particularly family sized housing.,149,,
626,0.97,7102.829,7130.256,"We have a very diverse community here and many of the households are Multigenerational so this is important because they aren't served by studios and one bedrooms that we have been building in the city and that has the opportunity for child care and as we have been talking about for a long time, we know how important it is to increase the amount of Childcare available.",149,,
627,0.97,7130.256,7153.779,I just wanted to touch base and thank you for letting me tap in and express my support and I want to thank the link news Committee for digging into the details of how to make sure that we are centering racial equity as we are thinking about how to move forward with the Land-Use policies.,149,,
628,0.97,7153.779,7161.787,Thank you Councilmember.,150,,
629,0.97,7161.787,7183.91,"I do have a question, Jeff, when we first spoke about this bill, I asked if you could explain how this qualifies for Rezone rather than contract and you provided a helpful memo and thank you for this memo that explains the distinction for our viewing public, would you be able to summarize the reasoning for anyone that may not have read your memo?",150,,
630,0.97,7183.91,7187.38,Great.,151,,
631,0.97,7187.38,7187.98,Thank you.,151,,
632,0.97,7187.98,7212.738,This is a legislative Rezone which is a city initiated Rezone that has changed to policy and this case to the regulations and is different from what we call a contract Rezone what individual property owner applies for a change to the zone according to some criteria in the code.,151,,
633,0.97,7212.738,7242.468,This is making amendments to policy and the reason why it qualifies for such is because this is an area as the name applies so it is a collection of sites that composes a relatively large area when you look at the number of parcels on the size and all those lands are physically close to each other in one neighborhood and within walking distance of one another.,151,,
634,0.97,7242.468,7264.757,This is proposed with a strategic purpose so all these are sites that will directly support affordable housing and community support so it hangs together that purpose in addition to being the collection of sites.,151,,
635,0.97,7264.757,7296.222,"The executive and Councilmembers felt it was a high priority to bring this proposal forward as a policy change this time because as the Councilmember noted, it really does support community that is important in light of Covid-19 impacts and high-risk displacement and does not create any additional risk of displacement because they do not have housing.",151,,
636,0.97,7296.222,7302.495,High priority to bring it forward at this time as a policy change.,151,,
637,0.97,7302.495,7302.795,Thank you.,151,,
638,0.97,7302.795,7305.831,"Thank you, Jeff.",152,,
639,0.97,7305.831,7321.213,That is helpful information and the memo is very instructive for me understanding how this change fits into the process and the ways we are able to Rezone.,152,,
640,0.97,7321.213,7324.083,Have you heard any concerns arising from the community?,152,,
641,0.97,7324.083,7326.919,I have not.,153,,
642,0.97,7326.919,7344.97,I have not received any comments since we last talked and I have heard from the agencies and housing providers that want to see it move forward but I have not heard any comments or Oppositions.,153,,
643,0.97,7344.97,7345.371,Thank you.,154,,
644,0.97,7345.371,7351.877,Very helpful.,154,,

646,0.97,7352.678,7360.052,I know we had a robust hearing even though it was about a month ago on this bill.,154,,
647,0.97,7360.052,7364.59,Any additional comments or thoughts?,154,,
648,0.97,7364.59,7365.091,Councilmember Peterson.,154,,

654,0.97,7425.885,7442.601,I am excited moving forward and I want to emphasize the importance of this be directly connected to transit opportunities and our commitment to the development which has been a more equitable way.,157,,

715,0.97,7740.065,7753.479,Our fourth item of business today is a briefing and discussion on Council bill CB 119877 which would extend the allowance for virtual design review and landmark preservation meetings.,201,,
716,0.97,7753.479,7755.681,Would you please read the abbreviated title into the record.,201,,
717,0.97,7755.681,7774.9,"Agenda item four Council bill CB 119877, an ordinance related to Venues review decision and meeting procedure simply modifying and spending procedures titles 23 and 25 of the Seattle municipal court admitting chapters of the Seattle municipal code.",202,,
718,0.97,7774.9,7775.4,Thank you.,203,,
719,0.97,7775.4,7803.829,"We are doing by Mike Podowski, Lisa Rutzick, Sara Belz, Sarah Sodt, and Maureen Sheehan to provide a briefing.",203,,
720,0.97,7803.829,7805.497,I don't know who wants to go first.,203,,
721,0.97,7805.497,7811.737,I will say a few words and highlight the mechanics of this legislation from the ordinance and then talk about next steps.,204,,
722,0.97,7811.737,7824.149,And then I can turn it over to Sdci to go over the ordinance of the bill.,204,,
723,0.97,7824.149,7824.483,Sound okay?,204,,
724,0.97,7824.483,7826.018,Sounds great.,205,,
725,0.97,7826.018,7863.789,This is an initial bill of CB 119877 which would have modifications to Land-Use preservation procedures and back in April and this is designed by the March procedures in the process and I'm probably missing a few but those are the types of processes that are affected by this proposed Council bill.,206,,
726,0.97,7863.789,7894.086,"Just to refresh your memory, the Council did request a report with progress of virtual meetings and that report is attached to the agenda provided by Sdci in July in details with the challenges and the technology to facilitate virtual meetings and indicates that virtual meetings began to roll out in August.",206,,
727,0.97,7894.086,7928.954,"Just one key distinction as opposed to the previous bill that the Council considered, ordinates 126072, the one that many of the changes would be extended by the current bill wasn't acted on charter emergency basis to allow the bill to become effective immediately and was 390 which has a provision that allows jurisdictions to bypass procedural requirements to establish regulations on interim and in this case a Six- month basis.",206,,
728,0.97,7928.954,7959.451,The current bill is not proposed to be enacted as emergency so it is a little different in character and the provisions the bill are temporary but expire on a date that is identifiable so many of the changes would continue until six months after the Mayor TERMINATES the civil emergency and that is a date that is unknown.,206,,
729,0.97,7959.451,7963.088,That is something to keep in mind considering the provisions of this bill.,206,,
730,0.97,7963.088,7996.822,"For the process, this is an initial briefing and there is a public hearing that is scheduled for the 23rd and just given how this bill would become effective, there is a gap between when the bill could become effective and when the provisions for the April ordinance expires so if the Council wants to minimize that gap, the committee may want to consider action on the same day as the public hearing.",206,,
731,0.97,7996.822,8000.292,That's all for me unless you have further questions and I will turn it over to Sdci.,206,,
732,0.97,8000.292,8000.892,Thank you.,207,,
733,0.97,8000.892,8010.435,I have many questions here and one I believe you touched on is do we have an exact date that the ordinance expires?,207,,
734,0.97,8010.435,8015.707,I believe it is October 25.,208,,
735,0.97,8015.707,8016.341,That is right.,209,,
736,0.97,8016.341,8016.742,Copy.,210,,
737,0.97,8016.742,8022.814,Thank you very much.,211,,
738,0.97,8022.814,8023.115,Taken away.,211,,
739,0.97,8023.115,8026.451,Thank you for your time and attention this morning.,212,,
740,0.97,8026.451,8032.791,We have a brief presentation and I think it is on its way.,212,,
741,0.97,8035.961,8039.264,There we go.,212,,
742,0.97,8039.264,8071.196,I will do the bulk of speaking to the slides and then Lisa and Sarah will join in to provide a status report and progress that was mentioned on how the references are going with demonstrated and virtual meetings to date.,212,,
743,0.97,8071.196,8077.669,"So, the introduction serves the purpose well.",212,,
744,0.97,8077.669,8081.706,We have a little bit more Maybe to add to that and a couple things to add.,212,,
745,0.97,8081.706,8099.191,We will have a status report and unpack some of the details about the provisions that are proposed to be extended and a few minor Tweaks that we are hoping the committee will agree are good things to do.,212,,
746,0.97,8099.191,8152.477,"As Ketil mentioned, following the Covid-19 emergency proclamation by the governor, related to public gatherings and limiting them even in the case of local government decision-making in the interest of public health and safety as well as the emergency declaration that the Mayor made as we talked about the provisions of the emergency bill, they do expire soon given where we are now and as Ketil mentioned, we were proposing rather than having to come back to Council because we don't know when it will be safe again for us to have meetings in person tying the end date to the extent the provisions to a finding that the emergency is no longer in our midst.",212,,
747,0.97,8152.477,8197.923,"Just at a high-level unpacking of what we will talk about in more detail, the ordinance allowed for virtual meetings and as you heard in the comments in the beginning, it is the departments interest and support of public outreach to have public meetings whether virtual or in person but given some of the technical difficulties and capacity challenges that virtual meetings pose, we do want to talk with you more about limited extension of some of the ability to do more administrative review related to the design review processes that are part of that also.",212,,
748,0.97,8197.923,8247.872,We also will talk about some of the projects related to the start restoration and some of the other important permit reviews that they are in charge of as well is the demonstrated decision making ability and a Ministry to review is really important in the short term while these bills are in place to allow processes to continue so it is a predictable environment for permit applicants as well as neighbors and others following along and also so we can manage the capacity of the virtual meetings to focus on the important and Impactful meetings that people have been waiting on.,212,,
749,0.97,8247.872,8258.283,"At this point, I will turn it over to Lisa and Sarah to talk more about the experience we have had since the emergency bill was put in place with these three major categories.",212,,
750,0.97,8258.283,8263.555,Thank you.,213,,
751,0.97,8263.555,8280.438,"Hi, my name is Lisa Rutzick, we launched the meetings in August person had for the meetings in August and four scheduled for September as well.",214,,
752,0.97,8280.438,8301.593,We are planning to fold in the projects of the recognition phase starting on October 1. we currently have nine projects scheduled for October including both early design guidance and recommendations phased projects.,214,,
753,0.97,8301.593,8326.451,We hired a staff person to help Ron and I refer to him as the technology pilot so he is working in connection with staff and the board chair for these meetings and so far they have gone fairly smoothly and we are continuously improving on the process and trying to better understand the platform which is also evolving.,214,,
754,0.97,8326.451,8343.368,We are feeling like it is going well and we will continue to Rollout and we would have the ability to do full capacity for all the projects to go virtual.,214,,
755,0.97,8343.368,8347.038,I see a question from Vice- chair Mosqueda and I have a question as well.,215,,
756,0.97,8347.038,8348.239,"Vice-Chair Mosqueda, please take it away.",215,,
757,0.97,8348.239,8350.475,Thank you very much.,216,,
758,0.97,8350.475,8374.866,Can you speak to the Perming turnaround times of when these were adopted with the permanent times.,216,,
759,0.97,8374.866,8381.506,I cannot speak to that component because they are exempt so I'm no longer working with those projects.,217,,
760,0.97,8381.506,8399.424,"The turnaround time for projects that are staying, I don't have the exact numbers and it's been a little bit of a shift because there is time saved I keeping the projects In- house and not having to wait to be scheduled in the boards calendar.",217,,
761,0.97,8399.424,8422.547,"However, staff has been inundated with taking this body of work over the past six months so I don't know where the Timelines have fallen over the past six months but those are the things we will be juggling with.",217,,
762,0.97,8422.547,8431.556,I would just add that the office of housing is looking into helping us describe the benefits that have accrued to the affordable housing projects and we understand there have been about doesn't and we can report back with that information.,218,,
763,0.97,8431.556,8432.323,Thank you.,219,,
764,0.97,8432.323,8436.161,Thank you both.,220,,
765,0.97,8436.161,8447.672,"Lisa, can you share how this has improved the design process and if either direction, what improvements do you need to be making or thinking about at this time?",220,,
766,0.97,8447.672,8448.773,Is a good question.,221,,
767,0.97,8448.773,8449.774,It still feels fairly new.,221,,
768,0.97,8449.774,8459.551,We've only had four projects under our belt and have her fifth meeting tonight.,221,,
769,0.97,8459.551,8469.093,"I think for some people, having that Digital access to a meeting is much easier than showing up in person and for others, it's less convenient.",221,,
770,0.97,8469.093,8478.203,I have been hearing a lot of positive feedback about it although I've heard some complaints as well and I don't have any specific data.,221,,
771,0.97,8478.203,8491.683,"I think the time of day, they were typically held in the evenings and now late afternoon to early evening.",221,,
772,0.97,8491.683,8495.186,"I think there are some people that are please with that change while others, it's not convenient.",221,,
773,0.97,8495.186,8501.192,That speaks that there is no perfect time to be convenient for everybody.,221,,
774,0.97,8501.192,8548.273,The ability for public comment to happen during the meeting is still the same agenda and people have the option of speaking during the public comment or writing in a comment read into the record and we have been able to get a lot of consistency across the different boards with the script we are all using and sticking to as we are moving into this new world so I think that is a nice point of consistency.,221,,
775,0.97,8548.273,8550.742,And there is a learning curve for everyone.,221,,
776,0.97,8550.742,8564.556,The downside it is quite intensive and probably three or four hours and prep work prior to every meeting that never occurred before.,221,,
777,0.97,8564.556,8582.607,We are doing dry runs with every applicant team and with the board and we have 15 or 20 staff and then every applicant team.,221,,
778,0.97,8582.607,8588.112,It is quite a bit of advanced work which we would want to do and provide that resource for people to feel comfortable but it is time-consuming.,221,,
779,0.97,8588.112,8598.256,I am imagining and helping that it will be most intense now when we will decrease as we get more comfortable with it but these first few months are pretty resource intensive.,221,,
780,0.97,8598.256,8608.433,"Yes, we have that same experience as we transferred to virtual meetings and as you saw earlier today, we still had virtual issues.",222,,
781,0.97,8608.433,8614.739,"[laughing], yes.",223,,
782,0.97,8614.739,8625.95,Your points about for some people it's easier to attend because they don't have to travel anywhere and can simply access the meeting over the Internet.,224,,
783,0.97,8625.95,8648.873,"That is convenient for some and for others, that ability to access technology is a barrier so understanding there is no perfect method, I've heard good feedback so far about the virtual meetings and if this legislation were not adopted, would virtual meeting still continue to occur?",224,,
784,0.97,8648.873,8656.981,My understanding is that we actually need the legislation in order for us to the virtual meetings.,225,,
785,0.97,8656.981,8665.623,One of the important things to realize is the code specifies that meetings are held in the District where the projects occur so in one of the eight districts.,225,,
786,0.97,8665.623,8675.466,That alone Resuscitate that we have this ability to run a Digital meeting which obviously is not occurring in any given address.,225,,
787,0.97,8675.466,8680.571,"Great, very helpful.",226,,
788,0.97,8680.571,8684.008,"Colleagues, does anyone have questions for Lisa in particular?",226,,
789,0.97,8684.008,8686.844,Maybe we will continue through the presentation.,226,,
790,0.97,8686.844,8698.423,We could have Sarah speak to the D.O.N.,227,,
791,0.97,8698.423,8698.69,Program.,227,,
792,0.97,8698.69,8731.722,"Heidrick the community assets division which includes historic preservation and also on the call today is Sarah Sodt and Maureen so if you have any questions, they are available as well.",228,,
793,0.97,8731.722,8748.372,"To give you a background of where we are at in our process, for historic preservation boards and Commission, we began hosting virtual meetings in early July and I believe the first meeting was on July 1 and that was or the landmark preservation board.",228,,
794,0.97,8748.372,8755.68,"Benson, the Pike place market International special review report has also held virtual meetings.",228,,
795,0.97,8755.68,8774.198,We are also in the process of developing and Lamenting language access protocols for Isrd in partnership with the liaison teams and the staff.,228,,
796,0.97,8774.198,8778.069,We are hoping to get those Operationalized within the next few weeks.,228,,
797,0.97,8778.069,8807.932,"In terms of the breakdown between administrative review and virtual meetings, under the emergency legislation for historic preservation staff had the authority to complete and Ministry reviews of many of the minor or smaller scale applications that come into the historic preservation program so things like sign interviews and applications for awnings and exterior painting and those sorts of things.",228,,
798,0.97,8807.932,8816.24,Staff are processing administratively now instead of sending them to the full board.,228,,
799,0.97,8816.24,8831.355,Larger scale applications and things like designation applications and applications related to new construction and things like that are still being processed through our historic preservation boards.,228,,
800,0.97,8831.355,8842.233,"In terms of public school departures, staff had the authority to complete Demonstrator reviews of Public- school departure and applications and that is a process that we work through with Sdci staff.",228,,
801,0.97,8842.233,8857.782,I believe three schools have at least begun the process of reviewing departure applications for three Public- school projects.,228,,
802,0.97,8857.782,8872.697,The other element is the major institution advisory committee and marine has begun conducting those meetings virtually in that process also I believe began in July.,228,,
803,0.97,8872.697,8913.337,"What we are doing there is we are trying to only host virtual meetings of the major institution committees when there is a need either due to a new construction project or proposed amendment for the master plan or an annual meeting requirement that needs to be met and prior to Covid- 19, some of the committees such as the committee for Udub were meeting monthly and out just went there is action needed by the committee.",228,,
804,0.97,8913.337,8928.352,"Wonderful, thank you . a similar question that I asked Lisa, how has this been going and what are the benefits and drawbacks to virtual meetings and are there improvements to be made?",229,,
805,0.97,8928.352,8945.002,"Yeah, I may defer some of the response to that to Sarah and marine just because they are more in the thick of it in terms of facilitating the public meetings.",230,,
806,0.97,8945.002,8966.757,"I will say we are using Webex and that is the platform we have chosen and I think overall, have felt like that has been a successful Avenue for us but I will defer to them to respond to that directly.",230,,
807,0.97,8966.757,8980.771,"Thanks, this is Sarah Sodt and I can really just echo a lot of the same comments that Lisa made.",231,,
808,0.97,8980.771,8983.808,I think the staff lift is what has surprised us the most.,231,,
809,0.97,8983.808,8994.385,Just the work ahead of time that it takes to get the virtual meetings up and running.,231,,
810,0.97,8994.385,9028.919,We have received quite a bit of positive feedback I think that one of the big moves that we did was we had placed the public comment period at the beginning of the meeting so Úsome of the feedback we received is that it makes it easier for folks to know when to attend and has made Sign-Up pretty easy and smooth so that has been one of the changes we have made that has worked well for us.,231,,
811,0.97,9028.919,9036.761,"Otherwise, it has been very smooth and we will just keep doing them.",231,,
812,0.97,9036.761,9039.663,Wonderful.,232,,
813,0.97,9039.663,9049.04,Has there been an easy workload by allowing things like Signage and awnings to be done administratively?,232,,
814,0.97,9049.04,9057.548,I know through our work previously that sometimes those types of decisions can take up a lot of time.,232,,
815,0.97,9057.548,9060.384,"Yes, indeed.",233,,
816,0.97,9060.384,9087.878,That has really helped us reduce our agenda items for the virtual meetings down to the big more substantial agenda items and so staff has done about 115 administrative reviews since the legislation was put into place and those are 115 applicants that have not had to go to a virtual meeting.,233,,
817,0.97,9087.878,9114.638,The virtual landmarks board meetings started about at 3:30 and have been consistently going until 6:30 were 7 typically and we are trying to keep it down to three or four larger agenda items and that is working pretty well for us.,233,,
818,0.97,9114.638,9135.226,"So, we try to be done by 130 or 7 although we don't have a lot of control over that but it seems to be manageable so the initiative review helps us and is also beneficial to the property owners and business owners that are putting applications in.",233,,
819,0.97,9135.226,9143.667,"Very helpful, thank you.",234,,
820,0.97,9143.667,9149.173,"Colleagues, I have a number of questions to continue and just wanted to check with you to see if you wanted to jump in.",234,,
821,0.97,9149.173,9151.575,"Not seeing any questions from my colleagues, I will continue.",234,,
822,0.97,9151.575,9155.446,Feel free to jump in any time.,234,,
823,0.97,9155.446,9172.096,This may have been a question along the lines that Vice-Chair Mosqueda had asked Regina how many applications were approved through the Ministry to design review before virtual meetings began?,234,,
824,0.97,9172.096,9200.124,I don't have the numbers of how many projects have gone through and I know we did convert 70 projects within the effective date of the legislation and between March and this month.,235,,
825,0.97,9200.124,9215.139,I checked the numbers and I think it was 70 but I don't know and those were all projects that would have otherwise gone to the full board review.,235,,
826,0.97,9215.139,9229.887,I don't know the answers your question but I can try to get more details if you are wondering about the previous and it's not really apples to apples because they weren't subject to a review prior and these are ones that were full process.,235,,
827,0.97,9229.887,9239.53,Thank you.,236,,
828,0.97,9239.53,9245.636,"Fill free to connect after the committee meeting and if any of these questions, the answers are not right at the tips of your fingers, happy to follow up after.",236,,
829,0.97,9245.636,9266.557,Is might be more for Mike but can someone explain the reasoning behind allowing some projects to stay in the design review until the end of the year and why projects go back to the fold design review midstream and why that might pose problems?,236,,
830,0.97,9266.557,9268.592,Do you have a slide that speaks to that?,237,,
831,0.97,9268.592,9278.102,"If there's additional presentation, please, I'm happy to sit back and listen until the end of the presentation.",238,,
832,0.97,9278.102,9288.912,This is a natural extension and one of the adjustments we are proposing rather than extending what is in the emergency bill.,239,,
833,0.97,9288.912,9303.394,"The first time let you know that the people that testified, it allowed people to elect with the design review and we are proposing a limited extension of that as a transition if you will.",239,,
834,0.97,9303.394,9352.476,The item speak to that and his ability to do this would expire and would be only for projects that have already elected to be part of the process and have made certain milestones in that process and that is the second bullet there or the Council has experienced her use of Technologies as what we are planning for a contingency measure because of staff capacity owing to the needs for preparing for these meetings or technical glitches to make a meeting available to allow this limited use of review.,239,,
835,0.97,9352.476,9363.053,We are proposing a certain flavor but in a limited fashion.,239,,
836,0.97,9363.053,9378.669,"The final NOTE here lets you know that if we had not given public notice, we are proposing the line in the bill that would make it clear that we would do that.",239,,
837,0.97,9378.669,9379.303,Very helpful.,240,,
838,0.97,9379.303,9384.308,I will hold the rest of my questions until the end of the presentation.,240,,
839,0.97,9384.308,9388.612,"Okay, anything else from Lisa or Sarah?",241,,
840,0.97,9388.612,9397.187,I will back up a little here and we will get into some of the details that we skipped over.,241,,
841,0.97,9397.187,9399.623,"Mr. chair, so sorry.",242,,
842,0.97,9399.623,9430.654,"On slide seven, in the second bullet before we move on if that's okay, could you describe the potential impact to the project Timelines for the projects that are nearing completion of early design guidance which then are switched to a fall design review process and what would that cause the design review process to do?",242,,
843,0.97,9430.654,9437.561,Would it be longer than usual under design review?,242,,
844,0.97,9437.561,9440.464,That's probably better for Lisa to answer.,243,,
845,0.97,9440.464,9445.269,The answer to that is it depends.,244,,
846,0.97,9445.269,9478.769,"Some boards are quite busy and there are a lot of projects and construction and development been proposed and so the calendar tends to get booked up quicker than a district that hasn't been as busy so it depends on where the project is an for a project that has been converted and will go back to the review, really the only question is one is the next available date that the board has on that calendar to review the project.",244,,
847,0.97,9478.769,9498.322,It might be soon or just as soon as when staff would get to the review and it's hard to know because we can't predict how the volumes will play out in the future since it is in the applicant's court as to when projects come back to us.,244,,
848,0.97,9498.322,9508.398,It depends on staff capacity and workload and the volume that individual boards are experiencing.,244,,
849,0.97,9508.398,9512.936,"Just a quick follow-up, Mr.",245,,
850,0.97,9512.936,9513.27,Chair.,245,,
851,0.97,9513.27,9516.974,I don't know if you had something else.,245,,
852,0.97,9516.974,9530.354,There were some comments made earlier about a discussion of whether or not the closure has had an impact on development changes or slowing down development.,245,,
853,0.97,9530.354,9546.57,"I'm just wondering as a Follow- up since you have district information, living in district one does not seem like there has been a slowdown and maybe that is more on the residential side.",245,,
854,0.97,9546.57,9554.778,"Perhaps, you could give us a quick summary to see if you see that noticeable impact and if you don't have that now, that's okay.",245,,
855,0.97,9554.778,9572.663,What I can say is there had been no activity with the Southwest board for several months but I was very happy that the first two meetings were with the board and I was excited that we could at least give West Seattle folks the first virtual meeting.,246,,
856,0.97,9572.663,9596.82,There were two fairly large sites that went through that process last month with the Southwest board and they have a third project scheduled for early October so it seems like it has picked up more than the past few months but it is anecdotal and hard to know what to attribute that to.,246,,
857,0.97,9596.82,9597.654,That seems consistent.,247,,
858,0.97,9597.654,9605.996,Thank you for the summary and I will keep an eye on it.,247,,
859,0.97,9605.996,9616.44,"Wonderful, thank you.",248,,
860,0.97,9617.808,9620.243,The next two slides will be the conclusion of our presentation.,249,,
861,0.97,9620.243,9634.524,It just kind of lays out the aspects of designer review and the programs that would be extended as they are in the ordinance.,249,,
862,0.97,9634.524,9649.473,It runs from things we have been talking about already about virtual meetings and limited ability to continue for administrator design review and some people spoke to this issue as part of the testimony.,249,,
863,0.97,9649.473,9667.891,There are some provisions that we would extend an exempt certain affordable housing projects from the review process but do allow the Sdci director to have flexibility with the Veltman standards and permits.,249,,
864,0.97,9667.891,9686.41,For liquidity outreach is run by the Department of neighborhoods as a part of that process in recognizing virtual meetings that are a part of that.,249,,
865,0.97,9686.41,9703.06,There is special zoning provisions including thresholds that apply to the housing authority and the terrace development and administrative review and virtual meeting provisions that are specific to them.,249,,
866,0.97,9703.06,9720.944,"As Sarah and her staff were talking, some of the approvals for landmarks can be done administratively in the first line lists the landmark areas that are involved in the processes.",249,,
867,0.97,9720.944,9749.973,School departures for public schools is something we are running on a virtual basis at this point as well as a planning tool used in the downtown zone and these are proposals that would span more than one block and area and involves the public processes for benefits that would be an important part of that solution.,249,,
868,0.97,9749.973,9755.879,Provisions allow for virtual meetings to accomplish those.,249,,
869,0.97,9755.879,9774.197,"We already talked about this slide and those were the things we wanted to bring to your attention in this presentation and we had a good conversation and is there any final questions, we would be happy to take them.",249,,
870,0.97,9774.197,9774.998,"Yes, thank you.",250,,
871,0.97,9774.998,9793.783,Lisa and Sarah and Sarah had a wonderful presentation and I appreciate all the fast work with the original bill and being able to quickly change how we do business to adapt to this Covid-19 reality.,250,,
872,0.97,9793.783,9795.585,I will not call it a new normal yet.,250,,
873,0.97,9795.585,9796.52,We are still Transitioning.,250,,
874,0.97,9796.52,9804.027,One question I do have is what is the basis for setting expiration to the extension of six months post the civil emergency ending.,250,,
875,0.97,9804.027,9814.805,I do have strong concerns with this and I want to make sure that I understand what the rationale is.,250,,
876,0.97,9814.805,9834.057,We are not certain in the beginning when conditions would be safe and we certainly value public participation and are looking forward to post Covid- 19 times and being able to get back together.,251,,
877,0.97,9834.057,9868.191,We think the Ministry proposal is limited and does not interfere with the value that we place on the virtual public meetings at this point but we did think that things are uncertain enough even in the private sector businesses Recon people to their offices to the earliest of January and things are happening with the government including the governor's proclamation related to public health and safety and allowances under the state laws for open public meetings.,251,,
878,0.97,9868.191,9890.78,"It does seem like in our minds, an approach that was key towards conditions and facing us at the time whether or not an emergency proclamation was still applicable and it seemed like a very logical and responsive way to frame how long the bill would last.",251,,
879,0.97,9890.78,9904.427,"In the 180 days, it was meant to give people time to close up their work and not be surprised by the termination of the proclamation.",251,,
880,0.97,9904.427,9924.614,"We would be happy to talk with you further about other ways to accomplish these goals but we think perhaps this would be if you agree, a common way to approach any of the provisions of the city has going on across the board if conditions will still continue for special treatment.",251,,
881,0.97,9924.614,9976.933,"I would love to follow-up with you about that I do have initial concerns about extending the life of this bill if it passed with the civil emergency and with that said, in the conversation with Lisa and Sarah and Sarah, it does demonstrate that there are benefits to how we are adapting to this changed scenario of having to work virtually and so maybe there is a way that we can merge our desires and I'm sure there is a predictable stream of permit review and approval or denial for builders to have predictability.",252,,
882,0.97,9976.933,9982.772,I do have a few other questions and this might be for Ketil.,252,,
883,0.97,9982.772,9988.745,Has public notice been notified?,252,,
884,0.97,9988.745,9995.518,"I guess, that might still be for Mike.",252,,
885,0.97,9995.518,9996.586,I can get back.,253,,
886,0.97,9996.586,10007.731,Every single project that converted over to misread of designer view was given public notice.,253,,
887,0.97,10007.731,10012.836,The thinking is going forward if the last notice that occurred did not identify as a Ministry to review then we will provide that notice.,253,,
888,0.97,10012.836,10016.706,"Excellent, thank you so much.",254,,
889,0.97,10016.706,10029.419,"Lastly, could you remind us of when the legislation was posted to the committee Website and confirmed that public hearing was given 30 days before the hearing?",254,,
890,0.97,10029.419,10043.333,We posted the legislation that had not been introduced but posted the legislation and materials attached to the agenda to the Land-Use and neighborhoods community Webpage back in August.,255,,
891,0.97,10043.333,10057.947,The hearing has been noticed and was provided probably 33 days or so and the hearing is scheduled for the next Land-Use neighborhoods and Committee meeting on September 23rd.,255,,
892,0.97,10057.947,10058.948,"Wonderful, thank you.",256,,
893,0.97,10058.948,10061.785,Any further questions?,256,,
894,0.97,10061.785,10062.919,Any further comments?,256,,
895,0.97,10070.627,10091.014,I just want to jump in a little bit because I think there has been some confusion among some in the community about the scope of this legislation and I just wanted to try to put a fine point on the categories and projects that are covered and how this would influence things.,257,,
896,0.97,10091.014,10120.11,"My understanding is as far as being able to elect to enter into the insured review as an alternative to full design review based on the earlier comments from Presenters, that would be limited to essentially Grandfathering people in and they were already elected into the emergency ordinance to continue to pursue it and they would be allowed until the end of this year.",257,,
897,0.97,10120.11,10123.847,That is my first question just to confirm that is the case.,257,,
898,0.97,10123.847,10153.576,"My second question would just be if someone could provide a quick summary of the scope of projects under this new bill, it would be subject to the new virtual meetings and in the scope of projects that would be subject to have design review entirely.",257,,
899,0.97,10153.576,10193.783,"I do think it is important to make sure that some of the concerns in the public that I think are based on assuming this bill completely gets rid of design review and people that are in favor of that were against that, I think it is important to know what this does and the scope and scale of the projects impacted and I want to make sure, this is a good time to just really quickly run down the bullet points of the public knows exactly what this does and what the scope of the impacted projects is.",257,,
900,0.97,10193.783,10197.687,Do you want to take that?,258,,
901,0.97,10197.687,10198.888,I would love to.,259,,
902,0.97,10198.888,10213.736,To answer the first part of your question which was that going forward all projects will be subject to virtual design review unless you are Grandfathered in.,259,,
903,0.97,10213.736,10235.258,"That is correct but there is a caveat and the only ones that are allowed to stay in the Ministry to track our once I completed the early design guidance phase under the emergency provisions of the existing emergency ordinance and in the new ordinance, extended to December 31.",259,,
904,0.97,10235.258,10251.274,"In other words, if you converted to the Ministry of design review and completed the Edg under that review during the life of this emergency ordinance, you are allowed to stay in the mission of track for the rest of the process.",259,,
905,0.97,10251.274,10254.01,Sorry to interrupt but can I ask a quick follow-up on that point?,260,,
906,0.97,10254.01,10263.486,I appreciate your response to that so how many projects would you predict would fall into that category at this point?,260,,
907,0.97,10263.486,10268.057,I would have to manually check that.,261,,
908,0.97,10268.057,10268.992,I don't have a number.,261,,
909,0.97,10268.992,10272.028,I can follow up with you on that.,261,,
910,0.97,10272.028,10276.065,"If you could send it to me, I would appreciate that.",262,,
911,0.97,10276.065,10284.607,It sounds like a pretty narrow category of projects so I would like to have that fact at my fingertips and I appreciate you clarifying that.,262,,
912,0.97,10284.607,10287.877,Sorry to interrupt.,262,,
913,0.97,10287.877,10315.038,It is all very Wonky and generally might say there were recognition levels and half for Edg levels of the ones in that phase and I would think that at least half of those completed Edg and would be able to stay in the Ministry to track.,263,,
914,0.97,10315.038,10326.716,Other ones may have been brought back for a second or third review meeting they have not completed.,263,,
915,0.97,10326.716,10361.584,"I'm hoping that answers the first part of your question and the second part which is the big overview of what this all means, you can talk about what the threshold table is and it is not any form of designer view.",263,,
916,0.97,10361.584,10362.785,And that is the designer review.,263,,
917,0.97,10362.785,10363.786,Nothing about that has changed.,263,,
918,0.97,10363.786,10367.29,"If you are between 15,000 square feet and 30,000 square feet, your survey to measure designer review.",263,,
919,0.97,10367.29,10368.091,None of that has changed.,263,,
920,0.97,10368.091,10372.995,"If you are over 30,000, you are subject to full designer.",263,,
921,0.97,10372.995,10395.118,"This legislation has before the review board and those products are allowed to convert to the design review but now that we have launched the board meetings, the process will be exactly the same except the board meeting is held virtually and I'm person.",263,,
922,0.97,10395.118,10416.606,There are some Caveats because we are talking about the Land- use codes and for projects that have certain site specific characteristics that would have been subject to streamlined design review may actually be bumped up to administrative design review and that is not the body of the projects we are talking about.,263,,
923,0.97,10416.606,10428.417,"We are talking about the ones that were over 30,000 square feet.",263,,
924,0.97,10428.417,10433.756,The affordable housing projects were already subject to a Ministry design review and now they are no longer subject to design review at all.,263,,
925,0.97,10433.756,10444.066,"I am hoping, does not give you the overview that you were looking for?",263,,
926,0.97,10444.066,10445.735,It does and I appreciate that.,264,,
927,0.97,10445.735,10471.294,That accords with my understanding and I think it was really important to get that at the end because a lot of the expectations and concerns for community that frankly I do not see worn out by the legislation and so I appreciate that you are able to clarify that because I think a lot of those concerns are unfounded based on what this actually does so thank you.,264,,
928,0.97,10471.294,10491.614,"It is quite complicated and difficult to summarize because as you know, there are exceptions but hope that explains in the most straightforward way that I can.",265,,
929,0.97,10491.614,10492.682,Thank you so much.,266,,
930,0.97,10492.682,10496.085,"I don't have any further questions, Mr. chair.",266,,
931,0.97,10496.085,10506.996,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",267,,
932,0.97,10506.996,10508.197,Any other questions from the committee?,267,,
933,0.97,10508.197,10509.232,"Vice-Chair Mosqueda, please take it away.",267,,
934,0.97,10509.232,10535.458,"Thank you and I want to thank Councilmember Lewis for asking us to provide question because I think to put it in terms where we are all or what we are all expecting right now, all of us are at home and if the offices were to open next week, I would be very concerned about coming in of the offices were to open in January, I would be very concerned about going in.",268,,
935,0.97,10535.458,10575.498,"Given that we are talking about volunteer boards, I just don't want to put anybody in a position where they are having to make a decision about whether or not they continue to serve on a volunteer board given the ongoing concerns about Covid-19 so no matter when a vaccine is ever present or it becomes more regular to go back into offices and let's say that happens in the spring next year, I don't want us to ever be in a position where we are unintentionally screening out those that have health complications or underlying health conditions that would prevent them from being able to serve on a board.",268,,
936,0.97,10575.498,10577.867,Because of being more at risk for the lingering effects of Covid-19.,268,,
937,0.97,10577.867,10593.883,It just makes a lot of sense to me that we are making accommodations to continue this type of operation so that we can have projects continue and make sure they are not having real box and not unintentionally screening out some liquidity members that want to serve on the volunteer boards.,268,,
938,0.97,10593.883,10613.803,To protect health.,268,,
939,0.97,10613.803,10615.838,"Any further questions, comments, concerns?",269,,
940,0.97,10615.838,10616.072,Good.,270,,
941,0.97,10616.072,10616.339,Great.,271,,
942,0.97,10616.339,10620.943,Go for it.,271,,
943,0.97,10620.943,10626.215,"I have concerns about it, but I can address those later.",272,,
944,0.97,10626.215,10626.482,Thank you.,272,,
945,0.97,10626.482,10633.756,.,272,,
946,0.97,10633.756,10634.657,"Thank you, all.",273,,
947,0.97,10634.657,10638.561,"Sarah, Sarah, Lisa, Mike, you are doing fantastic and amazing work for the city.",273,,
948,0.97,10638.561,10639.428,And I appreciate your work.,273,,
949,0.97,10639.428,10642.298,Thank you for coming to the committee today.,273,,
950,0.97,10642.298,10649.872,"This legislation will be back before the Committee on Wednesday, September 23rd, for a public hearing and possible vote.",273,,
951,0.97,10649.872,10663.886,Our final item of business today is a public hearing on Cb119382.,273,,
952,0.97,10663.886,10667.757,Will you read the abbreviated title.,273,,
953,0.97,10667.757,10667.89,.,273,,
954,0.97,10667.89,10673.796,Interim flood plain regulations.,274,,
955,0.97,10673.796,10673.929,.,274,,
956,0.97,10673.929,10675.331,Wonderful.,275,,
957,0.97,10675.331,10683.305,"As you recall, the Council adopted this as required by FEMA in July.",275,,
958,0.97,10683.305,10692.415,"Due to state law, the Council is required to hold a Postadoption public hearing.",275,,
959,0.97,10692.415,10694.316,"Before the hearing, we have a brief refresher.",275,,
960,0.97,10694.316,10697.787,Please take it away.,275,,
961,0.97,10697.92,10707.43,So you said some of the things I was going to say.,276,,
962,0.97,10707.43,10709.632,So thank you for that.,276,,
963,0.97,10709.632,10721.744,"And refresh the Countermembers' memories here, back in July, the council passed the ordinance to establish is interim regulations.",276,,
964,0.97,10721.744,10732.188,Passage of the regulation was necessary to ensure continued participation in the national flood insurance policeman.,276,,
965,0.97,10732.188,10733.823,It's a requirement.,276,,
966,0.97,10733.823,10741.163,It's an obligation that comes from regulations administered by FEMA.,276,,
967,0.97,10741.163,10750.739,"Because the regulations were on an interim basis, the Council can hold a hearing, which is what the committee is doing today.",276,,
968,0.97,10750.739,10753.676,They will transmit the permanent regulations for consideration later this year.,276,,
969,0.97,10753.676,10757.88,"Maggie, is there anything you would like to add to that?",276,,
970,0.97,10758.013,10760.182,Yeah.,277,,
971,0.97,10760.182,10763.152,I'll say a few things.,277,,
972,0.97,10763.152,10767.857,"Thank you, chair and Council members for having me here today.",277,,
973,0.97,10767.857,10779.535,"Most importantly, the ordinance includes the adoption of FEMA's maps that were adopted by FEMA in February 2020.",277,,
974,0.97,10779.535,10784.34,So these are the flood plain insurance rate maps and the flood insurance study for the city of Seattle.,277,,
975,0.97,10784.34,10792.915,And the regulations will be in effect for six months.,277,,
976,0.97,10792.915,10798.888,"That's starting August 23rd, which is the effective date of the ordinance.",277,,
977,0.97,10798.888,10802.925,"And currently, Sdci is working on the permanent regulations.",277,,
978,0.97,10802.925,10806.028,We have a Website up and running.,277,,
979,0.97,10806.028,10823.179,"And we hope to have the permanent regulations for city council for review later this year, beginning of next year, with the February expiration date of the interim regulations, unless they're renewed.",277,,
980,0.97,10823.179,10825.815,And then I can answer any questions specifically.,277,,
981,0.97,10825.815,10838.46,And also just to point everybody to the Sdci memo that provides additional details about the ordinance.,277,,
