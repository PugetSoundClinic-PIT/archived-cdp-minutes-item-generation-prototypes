72,0.97,350.316,359.392,And the Broadway Bia is quick to respond and has helped me as a property manager keep our building cleaner and safer for our commercial tenants and customers.,9,,
73,0.97,359.392,360.727,They saved us money and time.,9,,
74,0.97,360.727,368.601,"As a building manager, I think they provide a vital service to our community and have been especially help.",9,,
75,0.97,368.601,370.069,As things have become tougher.,9,,

82,0.97,389.222,389.822,I am here.,11,,
83,0.97,389.822,391.791,Can you hear me?,11,,
84,0.97,391.791,394.093,Yes.,12,,

86,0.97,394.694,395.094,Great.,13,,

88,0.97,401.267,402.969,I'm speaking also on the 120162.,13,,
89,0.97,402.969,409.842,A small group of us about eight years ago started the 57 emergence Association.,13,,
90,0.97,409.842,410.476,We were successful.,13,,
91,0.97,410.476,412.411,We did some sidewalk festivals.,13,,
92,0.97,412.411,417.483,Pulled some money together for group marketing and did trash pickup a couple of times.,13,,
93,0.97,417.483,425.958,But we also recognized that we needed a more sophisticated organization so we can organize our efforts.,13,,
94,0.97,425.958,430.596,"And, we looked at the Bia models around town.",13,,
95,0.97,430.596,433.099,"And, that would fit very well.",13,,
96,0.97,433.099,441.841,We liked it because it keeps the funds in our Micro community.,13,,
97,0.97,441.841,453.452,We liked it because it would attract a more diverse group of participants who themselves normally wouldn't come to a merchant meeting.,13,,
98,0.97,453.452,461.26,So we presented this to our merchant group meetings informally and there was unanimous support to go forward with it.,13,,
99,0.97,461.26,464.397,"And, this last meeting we had was about 14 months ago.",13,,
100,0.97,464.397,470.536,And it took about 14 months from there to today to get where we are now.,13,,
101,0.97,470.536,471.571,Asking for this vote.,13,,
102,0.97,471.571,474.073,Nobody wants to spend extra money.,13,,
103,0.97,474.073,477.877,But we all recognize we want to be Proactive as a community.,13,,
104,0.97,477.877,488.487,"And by Proactive, it is creating again a more sophisticated organization to address what will better us.",13,,
105,0.97,488.487,490.857,I am in support of this.,13,,
106,0.97,490.857,492.592,And I ask for Council's approval.,13,,
107,0.97,492.592,492.892,That's it.,13,,
108,0.97,492.892,500.266,So thank you very much for this opportunity to speak to you all as a citizen and as a business owner.,13,,
109,0.97,500.266,505.104,I take this privilege with honor and respect.,13,,
110,0.97,505.104,505.438,So thank you.,13,,
111,0.97,505.438,511.544,"Thank you very much, Ross, for calling in.",14,,
112,0.97,511.544,515.948,"Colleagues, I still see Michael Molini and Alan Jones as not present.",14,,
113,0.97,515.948,519.318,"And, we don't have any other folks signed up to speak.",14,,
114,0.97,519.318,527.86,"So, I am going to go ahead and close out public comment.",14,,
115,0.97,527.86,533.199,And ask you to read item 1 into the record.,14,,
116,0.97,533.199,543.409,"Item 1. office of planning and community development, equitable development initiative update for briefing and discussion.",15,,
117,0.97,543.409,543.709,Great.,16,,
118,0.97,543.709,544.31,Thank you very much.,16,,

121,0.97,564.497,565.998,Thank you all for being here.,16,,
122,0.97,565.998,576.142,"I am really excited to hear about the work that you have been doing, particularly about the projects that you have funded through this latest grant round.",16,,
123,0.97,576.142,584.15,"And also, just to hear more about what you have planned for this strategic investment fund.",16,,
124,0.97,584.15,593.259,"All, of course, with the goal of doing everything we can to prevent the displacement of our neighbors and small businesses.",16,,
125,0.97,593.259,610.142,"And, to support a much more equitable investment in the kinds of Antidisplacement strategies we know are so important to make sure that we keep communities rooted in the city.",16,,
126,0.97,610.142,615.748,So I will hand it off to you and what you have to show us today.,16,,
127,0.97,615.748,618.751,Thank you.,17,,
128,0.97,618.751,621.754,I don't see Rico.,17,,
129,0.97,621.754,626.826,Hopefully we can join.,17,,
130,0.97,626.826,629.495,"Again, my name is Ubax Gardheere.",17,,
131,0.97,629.495,636.969,And we will talk to you about the background.,17,,
132,0.97,636.969,640.74,All of that which is important.,17,,
133,0.97,640.74,644.877,"And, update on the investment fund which most of you have already seen it.",17,,
134,0.97,644.877,652.985,But it will just be a quick update on where that is.,17,,
135,0.97,652.985,663.696,"Moving forward, what payroll tax looks like, and the 2022 Fund.",17,,
136,0.97,663.696,664.063,"Next, Michael.",17,,
137,0.97,664.063,670.136,The Edi is an inside outside program that was born out of inside outside strategy.,17,,
138,0.97,670.136,678.344,"And, the Advisory board always holds us accountable to make sure we talk about it.",17,,
139,0.97,678.344,681.347,On any presentations that we do.,17,,
140,0.97,681.347,694.66,"So, about five years ago, communities organizing for equity, social equity task force, a coalition that was formed to create, inform implementation plan.",17,,
141,0.97,694.66,695.761,"And, Opcd.",17,,
142,0.97,695.761,701.233,And office of civil rights.,17,,
143,0.97,701.233,709.008,Partnered to come up with the program that is now called the Equid able development initiative that I said is about five years old.,17,,
144,0.97,709.008,724.623,"And then, at the time, the center for social inclusion also offered or provided some consulting capacity building for the task force.",17,,
145,0.97,724.623,744.41,"Next--as you know, the economic development initiative started with an equity analysis that was done in 2016 as a companion to the comprehensive plan.",17,,
146,0.97,744.41,754.954,A plan where there was race and social equity goals and policies in all of the different elements of the comprehensive plan.,17,,
147,0.97,754.954,769.702,And once we got equity analysis data we were directed to come up with the implementation plan.,17,,
148,0.97,769.702,770.736,And our financial strategy.,17,,
149,0.97,770.736,770.936,Next?,17,,
150,0.97,770.936,775.307,"As I said, the origin story is point and so is the history.",17,,
151,0.97,775.307,784.45,This is the Red lining map for in Seattle where it shows investment decisions made by the previous generations.,17,,
152,0.97,784.45,795.361,Contributed to and continues to contribute to the inequities communities experienced today.,17,,
153,0.97,795.361,796.295,Especially communities of color.,17,,
154,0.97,796.295,808.641,"You look at the areas declining, these same areas now that Edi is focusing on.",17,,
155,0.97,808.641,809.375,Next.,17,,
156,0.97,809.375,814.446,These other maps produced for 2016 equity analysis showing the displacement and access to opportunity.,17,,
157,0.97,814.446,823.155,And is the framework that we use to make decisions.,17,,
158,0.97,823.155,827.96,Make funding recommendations and the neighborhoods that we focus on.,17,,
159,0.97,827.96,831.864,And the map on the left is the highest displacement neighborhood.,17,,
160,0.97,831.864,835.467,The red areas on the map is where we normally focus on.,17,,
161,0.97,835.467,842.508,"And then, the one on the right, shows low access to opportunity.",17,,
162,0.97,842.508,846.679,That is the Brown areas.,17,,
163,0.97,846.679,860.025,"We also obviously focus on other considerations around proximity, investment.",17,,
164,0.97,860.025,860.392,Transportation.,17,,
165,0.97,860.392,867.333,"Also, we make sure we do not just focus on.",17,,
166,0.97,867.333,875.741,You are looking at this map and you don't see any neighborhoods specifically for indigenous communities.,17,,
167,0.97,875.741,885.317,"So, we have to make sure that we are defining those.",17,,
168,0.97,885.317,894.86,So this is the equitable framework with the goal of achieving racial equity that we need strong communities and strong people.,17,,
169,0.97,894.86,899.298,That means community stability and resilience in displacement pressures.,17,,
170,0.97,899.298,911.744,Also making sure that communities have access to great neighborhoods throughout the city.,17,,
171,0.97,911.744,922.454,This will require more public investment above the current levels.,17,,
172,0.97,922.454,925.09,And have outcomes.,17,,
173,0.97,925.09,926.992,The drivers have outcomes associated with it.,17,,
174,0.97,926.992,934.967,It is the framework that helps us advance the work we are doing.,17,,
175,0.97,934.967,941.573,The first around economic opportunity for marginalized populations.,17,,
176,0.97,941.573,944.71,And not focusing only on economic development.,17,,
177,0.97,944.71,951.984,"But also, providing access to quality education, training, living wage jobs.",17,,
178,0.97,951.984,962.928,"The next one is around displacement making sure we are enacting programs for businesses and community organizations, the ability to stay in their communities.",17,,
179,0.97,962.928,970.002,Not just focusing on affordable housing.,17,,
180,0.97,970.002,976.709,"But also, displacement and how it impacts the communities we are focusing on.",17,,
181,0.97,976.709,979.545,And building on the culture assets of the communities.,17,,
182,0.97,979.545,981.246,These are designed to be deployed together.,17,,
183,0.97,981.246,987.72,It is not like just focusing on Ecoomic development.,17,,
184,0.97,987.72,994.426,Or Prioritizing investments in affordable transportation in one area.,17,,
185,0.97,994.426,1000.933,Just making sure that we are deploying these equity drivers together.,17,,
186,0.97,1000.933,1008.273,A lot of what we fund have at least three equity drivers in the projects we propose.,17,,
187,0.97,1008.273,1032.598,"Next, as my colleague Michael always explains to folks that call us nationally and want to know more about the program, and they focus a lot, he once described it as Edi being an Anti-Racist program that happens to do real estate projects.",17,,
188,0.97,1032.598,1048.447,"And it is a values based program where we focus on communities most impacted by displacement and effort, that focus decision making processes into the structures of community development with clear accountability to the communities impacted.",17,,
189,0.97,1048.447,1056.755,"We focus on community strategies and believe in community self-determination, influence, and leadership.",17,,
190,0.97,1056.755,1060.559,And know the communities are successful as we saw in the last 18 months.,17,,
191,0.97,1060.559,1078.343,That is tapping into their own collective culture corner stone is key to ownership of the project.,17,,
192,0.97,1078.343,1082.948,The complexity of community needs.,17,,
193,0.97,1082.948,1083.415,Economic development.,17,,
194,0.97,1083.415,1083.882,Cultural development.,17,,
195,0.97,1083.882,1085.05,"Education, health care.",17,,
196,0.97,1085.05,1091.323,All those different broad based community development aspects.,17,,
197,0.97,1091.323,1094.493,"Most importantly, acknowledging historic injustices.",17,,
198,0.97,1094.493,1103.702,"And valuing efforts about addressing systemic racism and the constitutional barriers that exist for the communities, predominantly communities of colors.",17,,
199,0.97,1103.702,1130.662,We also value accountability and support efforts that are most likely to bring improvement to the lives of those most impacted by displacement and support efforts that leverage community resources and support assets available to lower income communities that are not typically recognized or valued in community development processes.,17,,
200,0.97,1130.662,1133.298,We also value flexibility and interdependence.,17,,
201,0.97,1133.298,1138.737,Knowing communities strive to create processes that reduce.,17,,
202,0.97,1138.737,1146.345,While providing a fair structure for all communities.,17,,
203,0.97,1146.345,1151.45,"Finally, a systemic change approach, which the Edi funded.",17,,
204,0.97,1151.45,1169.701,Fund investments and programs intended to advance projects and communities in the development process in a way that Prioritizes long time benefits and capacity for community members.,17,,
205,0.97,1169.701,1179.211,"Next, another way of looking at the map, we focus on targeted strategies.",17,,
206,0.97,1179.211,1195.761,Prioritize neighborhoods that exhibit high level displacement pressures.,17,,
207,0.97,1195.761,1199.765,Have suffered in Disinvestments.,17,,
208,0.97,1199.765,1201.733,That have community strategies.,17,,
209,0.97,1201.733,1203.535,Created through inclusive community engagements.,17,,
210,0.97,1203.535,1207.472,"As you might know, the first demonstration project came from this community strategy.",17,,
211,0.97,1207.472,1227.526,"And then, as I said earlier, focusing on areas that have major transportation or public investments.",17,,
212,0.97,1227.526,1234.6,That lead to displacement.,17,,
213,0.97,1234.6,1234.8,Yes?,17,,
214,0.97,1234.8,1235.067,Ubax?,18,,
215,0.97,1235.067,1235.334,Yes?,19,,
216,0.97,1235.334,1236.668,"Man, there is a bad echo.",20,,
217,0.97,1236.668,1237.869,I just want to thank you.,20,,
218,0.97,1237.869,1247.346,I think the last two slides are so important that you took time to walk through the values that this program are rooted in.,20,,
219,0.97,1247.346,1250.649,This is really a different way for the city to operate.,20,,
220,0.97,1250.649,1257.055,And I know we have been doing this for several years now.,20,,
221,0.97,1257.055,1269.167,But it is really important to acknowledge what you are trying to do is so different than the way we have operated in the past.,20,,
222,0.97,1269.167,1272.237,Making decisions about how our neighborhoods change and grow.,20,,
223,0.97,1272.237,1283.415,"What is crucial about this and why you are getting calls across the country, this is about acknowledging the harm that the city has done in the past.",20,,
224,0.97,1283.415,1288.787,And really working in an authentic and systemic way to start to repair that harm.,20,,
225,0.97,1288.787,1293.358,So I just want to thank you and your team for taking the time to walk through that.,20,,
226,0.97,1293.358,1293.625,Yeah.,21,,
227,0.97,1293.625,1293.925,Thank you.,21,,
228,0.97,1293.925,1300.432,"I just want to thank the Advisory board for always holding us accountable, making sure we are telling the story.",21,,
229,0.97,1300.432,1305.57,And not taking credit for the work that they worked so hard to accomplish.,21,,
230,0.97,1305.57,1309.775,We are just the vehicles for that.,21,,
231,0.97,1309.775,1321.219,"And speaking of advisory board right now, we have 11 of the 13.",21,,
232,0.97,1321.219,1323.722,Represented right now.,21,,
233,0.97,1323.722,1331.396,"And, we have two appointed by board.",21,,
234,0.97,1331.396,1334.533,That we are going to be filling this application out soon.,21,,
235,0.97,1334.533,1338.37,But I'm not sure how long it will take for folk to apply or how long it looks like.,21,,
236,0.97,1338.37,1344.443,Maybe early next year we will come back to it.,21,,
237,0.97,1344.443,1346.878,We looked at the gaps.,21,,
238,0.97,1346.878,1349.281,As far as demographics is concerned.,21,,
239,0.97,1349.281,1363.628,"Right now, what folks are really looking at, is folks with real estate.",21,,
240,0.97,1363.628,1366.031,We just have one native American presentation.,21,,
241,0.97,1366.031,1368.767,So just making sure we have more than one.,21,,
242,0.97,1368.767,1376.041,And what will it look like to have someone who has already suffered from displacement and doesn't live in the city.,21,,
243,0.97,1376.041,1378.41,But still works in the city.,21,,
244,0.97,1378.41,1381.146,And there are cultural anchors and things like that.,21,,
245,0.97,1381.146,1391.022,"So, the Advisory board did an analysis.",21,,
246,0.97,1391.022,1391.49,Trying to base this.,21,,
247,0.97,1391.49,1406.705,"Next, we talk about the role of community leading the work.",21,,
248,0.97,1406.705,1408.473,Coming from that history.,21,,
249,0.97,1408.473,1432.764,"And, the city being charged to equity by what you just said naming and addressing the historic impacts of institutional structure racism in our policies and making sure that we are not just talking about it.",21,,
250,0.97,1432.764,1441.54,But making sure that we are making those investments and programs in partnership with the community.,21,,
251,0.97,1441.54,1452.15,"As I mentioned earlier, office of civil rights, worked to make sure that the Ebi is not just another city program.",21,,
252,0.97,1452.15,1460.725,"But, it is a program that is Codesigned with the impact of communities.",21,,
253,0.97,1460.725,1460.926,Next.,21,,
254,0.97,1460.926,1464.696,I'm going to have Michael take it from here.,21,,
255,0.97,1464.696,1467.032,"Michael Blumson, you're it.",21,,
256,0.97,1467.032,1467.933,"Thanks, Ubax.",22,,
257,0.97,1467.933,1468.333,Hi everyone.,22,,
258,0.97,1468.333,1476.908,"So, this is more of a deep dive into our process that we just completed.",22,,
259,0.97,1476.908,1480.579,Feel free to stop me if you have any questions.,22,,
260,0.97,1480.579,1489.321,I will try to zip through this quickly.,22,,
261,0.97,1489.321,1492.257,It has the core criteria Ubax walked through.,22,,
262,0.97,1492.257,1493.758,The high risk of displacement.,22,,
263,0.97,1493.758,1495.76,The connection to the equity drivers.,22,,
264,0.97,1495.76,1499.698,The connection to the program values.,22,,
265,0.97,1499.698,1509.04,"And, what it means to be engaging with community members who are most impacted in a meaningful way.",22,,
266,0.97,1509.04,1512.777,That UPHOLDS the values of the race and social justice initiative.,22,,
267,0.97,1512.777,1514.679,Those are baked into the implementation plan.,22,,
268,0.97,1514.679,1535.1,One of the things that we ask the review committee to do is look at all of the core criteria used in the most strategic way.,22,,
269,0.97,1535.1,1554.486,"Are we engaging with partners who may never have been able to access capital funding before, and this requires a stretch to say this is one of those areas where institutional and systemic racism play in the ability of smaller organizations to get funded.",22,,
270,0.97,1554.486,1560.492,So what does that look like?,22,,
271,0.97,1560.492,1572.404,Displacement maps don't adequately address the experience of the native American and the urban native community here.,22,,
272,0.97,1572.404,1574.072,How does that play?,22,,
273,0.97,1574.072,1575.907,Intersectionalty with the Lgbtq community.,22,,
274,0.97,1575.907,1582.18,It is not easily reflected but we need to be thinking about that.,22,,
275,0.97,1582.18,1588.687,"Similarly, Edi is one of the only Nonresidential capital funding sources.",22,,
276,0.97,1588.687,1602.634,"How are the resources we have being strategically used, especially for types of projects that may have no other options per funding sources through regular channels.",22,,
277,0.97,1602.634,1611.977,And that doesn't necessarily mean that Edi won't opportunity those things.,22,,
278,0.97,1611.977,1624.656,"Looking at the recommendation, making sure we are not grouping in one way or another and trying to bring as big a cross section as possible on the types of projects being used.",22,,
279,0.97,1624.656,1639.471,"And certainly, there are questions about as you know, Ubax talks about balancing shovel ready and Hungriness.",22,,
280,0.97,1639.471,1647.445,"If we only do that, projects that are in the Visioning stage would never have a chance to move forward.",22,,
281,0.97,1647.445,1650.181,So where is the balance in that?,22,,
282,0.97,1650.181,1659.958,Folks really have to struggle through what are very large pool of great applications to reflect some of that balance.,22,,
283,0.97,1659.958,1666.731,So here is kind of a map of what has happened previously.,22,,
284,0.97,1666.731,1674.806,You can kind of see the distribution of the projects all over.,22,,
285,0.97,1674.806,1678.376,"This year, we put out a sizable chunk of money.",22,,
286,0.97,1678.376,1687.619,About 9.8 million was the remainder of resources that you had previously allocated last year from the Mercer Megablock.,22,,
287,0.97,1687.619,1691.322,5.2 of that had been spent in 2020.,22,,
288,0.97,1691.322,1696.861,"And, we released the rest and allocated it this year, 6.8 went out in the spring.",22,,
289,0.97,1696.861,1701.232,"And then, 3 million was added to the cycle this year.",22,,
290,0.97,1701.232,1714.746,Which is why we are ultimately able to make 9.8 million in awards instead of the baseline funding.,22,,
291,0.97,1714.746,1719.584,Why would we make everyone go through another and have everybody write applications.,22,,
292,0.97,1719.584,1724.456,Is there a way we can consolidate some of these processes?,22,,
293,0.97,1724.456,1731.796,You can see there has been a lot of different projects in different areas.,22,,
294,0.97,1731.796,1742.941,"By and large, well focused on displacement scattered throughout the city.",22,,
295,0.97,1742.941,1745.743,Here's the awards distribution this year.,22,,
296,0.97,1745.743,1750.248,You can see a decent similar spread of projects.,22,,
297,0.97,1750.248,1754.185,One of the things they are looking at is geographic distribution.,22,,
298,0.97,1754.185,1770.335,Are we making sure a lot of displacement areas are getting some level of investment and if you think about areas like North Seattle where there isn't Maybe the same level of established Nonprofits who have been doing this work in the past.,22,,
299,0.97,1770.335,1776.975,It is important to keep an eye on these places.,22,,
300,0.97,1776.975,1785.95,The vast majority of applications tend to come from the communities in Rainier Valley in the central district.,22,,
301,0.97,1785.95,1798.062,"They get a lot of distribution, but there was Intentionality around making sure that funds were thoughtfully distributed.",22,,
302,0.97,1798.062,1808.54,"And, one of the other features of Edi and this somewhat connects to shovel ready and shovel hungry.",22,,
303,0.97,1808.54,1816.748,It is fundamental to how we think about some of the Anti- racist work.,22,,
304,0.97,1816.748,1820.418,Is that organizations need to be supported as organizations.,22,,
305,0.97,1820.418,1839.504,"Can we as a program support organizations, both as they develop and manage those projects and have the capital resources to complete and build the projects.",22,,
306,0.97,1839.504,1845.944,"So this lists our projects that are only capacity building, the ones that didn't have anything in the requested line.",22,,
307,0.97,1845.944,1849.414,"And then, some that requested both capacity building and capital.",22,,
308,0.97,1849.414,1855.52,"But, we were only able to at this time award capital.",22,,
309,0.97,1855.52,1869.934,"Award the capacity for and hopefully, we will a able to continue to support them in the future with other funding.",22,,
310,0.97,1869.934,1873.404,There's a couple here that are not listed as publicly announced.,22,,
311,0.97,1873.404,1877.008,And they were not in the press releases either.,22,,
312,0.97,1877.008,1883.781,These are two projects that are actively looking for sites and negotiation.,22,,
313,0.97,1883.781,1889.887,So we are trying not to disrupt their negotiations by saying we just awarded all this funding.,22,,
314,0.97,1889.887,1897.562,This is what you should be charging to help them get the best price and make sure that public dollars are used as efficiently as possible.,22,,
315,0.97,1897.562,1917.248,"So as soon as those are completed, we will be able to tell everybody what they are doing.",22,,
316,0.97,1917.248,1924.088,Projects throughout the city.,22,,
317,0.97,1924.088,1924.289,Okay.,22,,
318,0.97,1924.289,1932.83,"Before we go on, does anybody have questions about that?",22,,
319,0.97,1932.83,1942.34,Any questions for Michael or Ubax for this portion of the presentation?,22,,
320,0.97,1942.34,1943.875,I see no hands.,22,,
321,0.97,1943.875,1944.709,So please continue.,22,,
322,0.97,1944.709,1944.976,Yes.,23,,
323,0.97,1944.976,1957.889,"This year, the Edi team also played under leadership in leading the investment fund.",23,,
324,0.97,1957.889,1965.096,A $30 million one time Fund.,23,,
325,0.97,1965.096,1969.033,Communities in risk of displacement.,23,,
326,0.97,1969.033,1970.001,Some of them were involved.,23,,
327,0.97,1970.001,1981.713,Came together in the economic development experts who initially met in 2019 to refine the focus of these funds.,23,,
328,0.97,1981.713,1987.385,And which kind of projects should be funded.,23,,
329,0.97,1987.385,2001.532,"And the criteria they came up with, long term impact, strengthening relationships.",23,,
330,0.97,2001.532,2002.2,Also the key.,23,,
331,0.97,2002.2,2013.511,"Also, combining affordable housing and other community benefits such as commercial space, affordable commercial space.",23,,
332,0.97,2013.511,2017.882,Cultural space.,23,,
333,0.97,2017.882,2024.455,That this program also had really focused criteria.,23,,
334,0.97,2024.455,2034.665,"And, also, this investment fund focused on filling the gaps with existing funding.",23,,
335,0.97,2034.665,2034.866,Next.,23,,
336,0.97,2034.866,2052.683,"The projects that we got, the team projects which are not public because of again, it is a real estate transaction, presented an executive session about the project.",23,,
337,0.97,2052.683,2063.928,Those projects are located all over the city.,23,,
338,0.97,2063.928,2074.372,Proximity . The the group that worked with coming up on this.,23,,
339,0.97,2074.372,2087.552,"And again, presented the black and indigenous people, community leaders.",23,,
340,0.97,2087.552,2092.39,Economic experts.,23,,
341,0.97,2092.39,2105.336,"And, have come up with a lot of benefits for affordable housing, seniors, child care, community space.",23,,
342,0.97,2105.336,2107.505,"Small business, presentation.",23,,
343,0.97,2107.505,2110.975,Historic preservation to name a few.,23,,
344,0.97,2110.975,2138.035,"And five years ago, almost five years ago when I took this job, and you asked me, in five years where do you see Edi or the Edi Fund, I never would have guessed by this time we would move close to $80 million to communities and neighborhoods that have previously been not part of the development process and things like that.",23,,
345,0.97,2138.035,2146.143,"And, just like, I want to give Kudos to the amazing Edi team that has worked with the communities and projects the last five years.",23,,
346,0.97,2146.143,2152.216,Continue to offer them technical assistance.,23,,
347,0.97,2152.216,2170.835,"And, gets me out of bed every morning, including the three kids I'm in charge of is just knowing that working with communities that have opportunities to really anchor themselves in place.",23,,
348,0.97,2170.835,2180.912,"And, projects that lead to racial equity outcomes.",23,,
349,0.97,2180.912,2196.193,"Next, I want to quickly talk about starts next year, the Edi funding is also going to increase with about 9% of the funding coming to the Equid able development program.",23,,
350,0.97,2196.193,2200.164,So continuing to support those projects that we currently support.,23,,
351,0.97,2200.164,2211.042,It is an exciting thing we are looking forward to.,23,,
352,0.97,2211.042,2223.654,"Next is the work plan, the significant investment fund.",23,,
353,0.97,2223.654,2232.563,Working with the Advisory board evaluation.,23,,
354,0.97,2232.563,2242.006,"So, continuing that work with the Advisory board.",23,,
355,0.97,2242.006,2245.977,The comprehensive funding strategy.,23,,
356,0.97,2245.977,2246.544,The significant investment.,23,,
357,0.97,2246.544,2247.011,The payroll tax.,23,,
358,0.97,2247.011,2258.789,Working with the other city departments that invest in these communities making sure we are threading the needle and working with other Funders.,23,,
359,0.97,2258.789,2265.196,The ones that get funded have opportunities to get funded.,23,,
360,0.97,2265.196,2272.837,"A lot of statewide, local groups that are looking at Edi as a moral defined project.",23,,
361,0.97,2272.837,2281.012,We will work with the Advisory board.,23,,
362,0.97,2281.012,2282.38,Ordinance has Resourcing for their time.,23,,
363,0.97,2282.38,2287.118,But what does it look like to put that on paper.,23,,

371,0.97,2342.139,2344.975,So I wanted to give an opportunity to add to it.,23,,

382,0.97,2393.958,2408.839,But I'm curious to know at least what your process will be for the comprehensive funding strategy.,25,,
383,0.97,2408.839,2413.177,We have a lot of different pots of money we are excited about.,25,,

385,0.97,2417.748,2423.287,"But I can imagine from your end, it is probably a little Clunck.",25,,
386,0.97,2423.287,2428.659,So I would love to hear if you have anything you are prepared to share yet.,25,,
387,0.97,2428.659,2436.934,With at least how you plan to try to sort all of that out and make it a little bit more useful for you.,25,,

389,0.97,2444.074,2456.42,Certainly aren't intending to create more work for you.,25,,

391,0.97,2460.791,2462.56,I have a couple of thoughts as well.,26,,

393,0.97,2477.808,2478.576,Didn't meet the criteria.,27,,
394,0.97,2478.576,2491.655,"Strategically, we bring the review committee members who are Funders.",27,,
395,0.97,2491.655,2496.093,There was somebody at the table at the time reading the applications.,27,,
396,0.97,2496.093,2497.995,And they knew the process was coming up.,27,,
397,0.97,2497.995,2507.071,"So, how do we bring all this different Funders from Seattle foundation.",27,,
398,0.97,2507.071,2511.709,We met with the new director.,27,,
399,0.97,2511.709,2514.778,"And, you know, then also internally.",27,,
400,0.97,2514.778,2516.48,The different departments touching all the neighborhoods.,27,,
401,0.97,2516.48,2525.155,How are we making sure that we are coordinated in our approach in meeting the needs of these communities.,27,,
402,0.97,2525.155,2526.857,Especially that Edi is five years old.,27,,
403,0.97,2526.857,2536.834,It is the next step of making sure that we are not Piecemealing funding.,27,,
404,0.97,2536.834,2548.712,That we are bringing a lot of unusual suspects to the table.,27,,
405,0.97,2548.712,2551.448,Other sources out there.,27,,
406,0.97,2551.448,2558.022,"So, we will do hopefully another.",27,,

408,0.97,2561.959,2565.796,And to work on a strategy to funding this project and neighborhoods.,27,,
409,0.97,2565.796,2572.436,"We have been focused on the projects, what I'm hearing from the managers.",27,,
410,0.97,2572.436,2584.148,We really need to focus on working with the other staff members who are working on neighborhood levels and planning.,27,,

412,0.97,2594.258,2604.168,"So, making sure the planning they are working with is representative with what they see in their communities.",27,,
413,0.97,2604.168,2608.272,So within the city and the bigger ECO system.,27,,
414,0.97,2608.272,2613.844,Is what we are thinking about.,27,,
415,0.97,2613.844,2616.547,"Rico, did you want to add anything to that?",28,,

417,0.97,2620.05,2625.055,And how we want to implement moving forward.,29,,
418,0.97,2625.055,2643.741,"I think part of the take away is understanding how important public private partnership is to getting to investing in community in a way that is Holistic, well rounded, and predictable.",29,,
419,0.97,2643.741,2667.731,"I would say that one of the things that we have started a conversation about, having gone through the process this year and the investment fund, we have a very good understanding today of a huge number of projects and a huge number of organizations trying to do good work.",29,,
420,0.97,2667.731,2681.412,"And while the dollars that we are talking about right now are huge, there is a huge unmet need.",29,,
421,0.97,2681.412,2699.463,"If I can project, looking at 2022, I think one of the strategies that we want to be able to talk about, how do we be intentional about supporting organizations we know that are out there doing good work already.",29,,
422,0.97,2699.463,2701.965,We don't have to start from scratch.,29,,
423,0.97,2701.965,2711.041,We have already started a bunch of conversations we want to be able to support next year.,29,,
424,0.97,2711.041,2715.946,And I think Ubax spoke to this as well.,29,,

545,0.97,3361.758,3371.735,And get our power point up and running.,44,,
546,0.97,3371.735,3373.737,Is that working?,44,,
547,0.97,3373.737,3374.037,I think so.,44,,
548,0.97,3374.037,3374.637,Great.,44,,

552,0.97,3391.387,3397.994,What we are going to go through today is not an overview of everything the office of arts and culture does.,44,,
553,0.97,3397.994,3402.465,But do some deep dives into the projects we wanted to showcase.,44,,
554,0.97,3402.465,3408.805,"That, have really gone through a lot of development in the last year.",44,,
555,0.97,3408.805,3414.144,"And, we try and fuse race and social justice into the work we do across the whole Department.",44,,
556,0.97,3414.144,3417.947,"But these particular projects were ones where, it really shines through.",44,,
557,0.97,3417.947,3420.85,And we were really proud of the impacts we were able to make.,44,,
558,0.97,3420.85,3425.422,So wanted to take a moment to share that with you.,44,,
559,0.97,3425.422,3427.39,"And, thank you for your time today.",44,,
560,0.97,3427.39,3430.026,I'll just jump right in here.,44,,
561,0.97,3430.026,3432.295,We will start.,44,,
562,0.97,3432.295,3441.638,These are the five projects we are Showcasing.,44,,
563,0.97,3441.638,3449.312,"The cultural space agency, public authority nomination Council.",44,,
564,0.97,3449.312,3452.615,And the presentation of demographic for the whole office.,44,,
565,0.97,3452.615,3462.425,We will start with Alex rose and our cultural creative work force development.,44,,
566,0.97,3462.425,3463.092,Thanks Calandra.,45,,
567,0.97,3463.092,3469.199,I'm excited to share this example with you.,45,,
568,0.97,3469.199,3472.535,Through the office of economic development.,45,,
569,0.97,3472.535,3487.684,"In order to address a need that has become clearer and clearer, through the research our offices have done, create stronger pathways.",45,,
570,0.97,3487.684,3493.356,Our two offices launched this cultural and creative work force development program.,45,,
571,0.97,3493.356,3494.657,And launch the beginning of 2020.,45,,
572,0.97,3494.657,3501.13,It was meant to be an In-Person program.,45,,
573,0.97,3501.13,3513.91,"And, while most Internship programs simply canceled, and, postponed their opportunities, this program quickly Pivoted to become a virtual program and it is still operating that way.",45,,
574,0.97,3513.91,3520.783,"So, this program is for young people ages 16 to 26.",45,,
575,0.97,3520.783,3521.584,We have additional support.,45,,
576,0.97,3521.584,3528.658,Aside from beside the program administration coming from the Northwest folk life.,45,,
577,0.97,3528.658,3534.23,We have the project that helps with on boarding employers.,45,,
578,0.97,3534.23,3547.076,"And getting supervisors prepared as well as teen ticks working with young folks who may be for them, it is their first.",45,,
579,0.97,3547.076,3549.345,And on boarding.,45,,
580,0.97,3549.345,3555.184,This program provides hand on experience in creative and cultural work.,45,,
581,0.97,3555.184,3566.195,We have additional elements of social capital or network building bringing in guest speakers.,45,,
582,0.97,3566.195,3570.166,Industry professionals who can provide mentor ship.,45,,
583,0.97,3570.166,3570.533,And follow up.,45,,
584,0.97,3570.533,3582.145,"Lastly, a really important part of this program, the youth voice is continuing to evolve the program to form a sector.",45,,
585,0.97,3582.145,3587.483,I want to shout out quickly.,45,,
586,0.97,3587.483,3597.66,Rachel Cisero who worked with us to Codesign.,45,,
587,0.97,3597.66,3609.172,The young folks work on developing skills like event production.,45,,
588,0.97,3609.172,3609.572,Graphic design.,45,,
589,0.97,3609.572,3611.741,"Social media, marking.",45,,
590,0.97,3611.741,3614.01,And go to the next slide.,45,,
591,0.97,3614.01,3615.678,So we have some number to share.,45,,
592,0.97,3615.678,3625.955,"Just to give you a sense of the scale, the scope and scale of this program.",45,,
593,0.97,3625.955,3628.791,We have to date.,45,,
594,0.97,3628.791,3629.125,37 interns.,45,,
595,0.97,3629.125,3639.235,The vast majority of them identify as Bipoc.,45,,
596,0.97,3639.235,3645.441,"We have 16 to 21 in the age range, the interns taking part in this program.",45,,
597,0.97,3645.441,3645.775,Alex?,46,,
598,0.97,3645.775,3646.809,I'm sorry to interrupt.,46,,
599,0.97,3646.809,3652.815,But I think we are still on the previous slide.,46,,
600,0.97,3652.815,3654.65,So can we go to slide 4?,46,,
601,0.97,3654.65,3661.424,I'm trying to get it to advance.,47,,
602,0.97,3661.424,3669.565,I might need to exit out and represent it.,47,,
603,0.97,3669.565,3695.892,"While that is getting pulled up, I will let you know, we have about 21 partner sites who are offering Internships and work experiences for young folks including private sectors, converge media.",48,,
604,0.97,3695.892,3700.963,Nonprofit partners.,48,,
605,0.97,3700.963,3705.234,Like ground zero radio.,48,,
606,0.97,3705.234,3712.075,The majority of those employer sites have mentors or supervisors who are reflective of the interns taking part in this program.,48,,
607,0.97,3712.075,3718.981,So that is really an important element.,48,,
608,0.97,3718.981,3720.216,It is a few months long.,48,,
609,0.97,3720.216,3730.026,A good number of interns have extended their Internships or leveled up to take on more responsibility and new assignments.,48,,
610,0.97,3730.026,3738.067,A few of them have also gone onto become employees of their employer's work sites.,48,,
611,0.97,3738.067,3741.17,So those are some great successes we are proud of.,48,,
612,0.97,3741.17,3752.748,We we have some quotes from the interns themselves who in come cases loved learning how civil businesses work.,48,,
613,0.97,3752.748,3755.284,Connecting to opportunities outside of their Internships.,48,,
614,0.97,3755.284,3768.965,The one in Orange is really an example of how a workplace can develop skills and awareness beyond what we think of as cultural and creative.,48,,
615,0.97,3768.965,3780.109,This is particularly looking at accessibility and design as one of the areas of learning that this program supports.,48,,
616,0.97,3780.109,3784.914,The next slide is a graphic created by one of the interns.,48,,
617,0.97,3784.914,3799.662,That just kind of celebrates the positive experiences.,48,,
618,0.97,3799.662,3804.367,We are having technical problems here.,48,,
619,0.97,3804.367,3824.387,You can learn more about the program on Northwest Website.,49,,
620,0.97,3825.822,3830.893,Thanks Alex . I'm going to navigate from the side bar.,50,,
621,0.97,3830.893,3841.404,It seem to be working better.,50,,
622,0.97,3846.876,3850.913,My name is Tina.,50,,
623,0.97,3850.913,3853.216,And I'm the education project.,50,,
624,0.97,3853.216,3855.017,I'm good with they pronouns.,50,,
625,0.97,3855.017,3859.722,The creative advantage is a big part of my work.,50,,
626,0.97,3859.722,3865.695,It is an investment in Seattle students and our community's creative future.,50,,
627,0.97,3865.695,3875.304,It is a city wide education justice initiative to establish equitable access to arts education.,50,,
628,0.97,3875.304,3881.31,This initiative has been sort of brewing and Solidifying since 2008.,50,,
629,0.97,3881.31,3892.388,Seattle public schools and the office of arts and culture have really been collaborating since that time to increase student access to quality arts education.,50,,
630,0.97,3892.388,3896.492,Especially in high needs schools in neighborhoods.,50,,
631,0.97,3896.492,3903.466,"In 2012, this initiative really kicked into high gear.",50,,
632,0.97,3903.466,3907.236,And it started with a very large report from the Wallace foundation.,50,,
633,0.97,3907.236,3910.373,Where there was a needs assessment done with Seattle public schools.,50,,
634,0.97,3910.373,3923.586,"At that time, the report showed not surprisingly, but, the community and families and students have been saying for a long time.",50,,
635,0.97,3923.586,3928.691,That access to arts education was not equitable in our city.,50,,
636,0.97,3928.691,3932.762,"And it is predictable based on race, Ethnicity.",50,,
637,0.97,3932.762,3934.13,Free and reduced lunch.,50,,
638,0.97,3934.13,3936.198,Special education.,50,,
639,0.97,3936.198,3941.304,Or English language Learner status.,50,,
640,0.97,3941.304,3945.875,"And, that is true nationally as well.",50,,
641,0.97,3945.875,3961.29,"To address these inequities, Seattle K12 arts plan was created and that really laid out specific strategies to address these and ensure all students have access to high quality arts education.",50,,
642,0.97,3961.29,3964.36,Creative advantage was born out of that plan.,50,,
643,0.97,3964.36,3968.264,"And really, it solidified our collective impact partnership between Seattle public schools.",50,,
644,0.97,3968.264,3978.808,The Office of arts and culture.,50,,
645,0.97,3979.475,3979.976,As the backbone structure.,50,,
646,0.97,3979.976,3987.75,More than 100 community arts Organzations and cultural organizations and individual teaching artists.,50,,
647,0.97,3987.75,3993.656,There is so much research that talks about why the arts are important.,50,,
648,0.97,3993.656,4001.03,I could talk about that from a spiritual perspective.,50,,
649,0.97,4001.03,4001.664,"Social, emotional perspective.",50,,
650,0.97,4001.664,4005.901,These are some of the reasons why.,50,,
651,0.97,4005.901,4006.302,Research based.,50,,
652,0.97,4006.302,4011.107,The creative advantages of restoring access to the arts for young people.,50,,
653,0.97,4011.107,4017.88,We know about the need of increased academic support.,50,,
654,0.97,4017.88,4020.483,The arts can do that.,50,,
655,0.97,4020.483,4023.119,For civic engagement.,50,,
656,0.97,4023.119,4026.856,To learn 21st century skills.,50,,
657,0.97,4026.856,4027.289,Critical thinking.,50,,
658,0.97,4027.289,4027.757,Creativity.,50,,
659,0.97,4027.757,4028.124,Collaboration.,50,,
660,0.97,4028.124,4031.093,Those things we know the arts teach.,50,,
661,0.97,4031.093,4036.599,"And it is a racial, equity, and social justice strategy.",50,,
662,0.97,4036.599,4050.212,Especially when you are thinking about who has access to those kinds of high quality learning environments and the benefits those bring to young people.,50,,
663,0.97,4050.212,4052.448,We need to make sure our students have that access.,50,,
664,0.97,4052.448,4062.425,"We can go onto the next slide, please.",50,,
665,0.97,4062.425,4070.166,"So, when talking about racial justice and arts education, that can look like access, that's a big part of what we are concerned about.",50,,
666,0.97,4070.166,4075.438,Making sure all young people have access.,50,,
667,0.97,4075.438,4078.107,Can also look at what's going on in the classroom.,50,,
668,0.97,4078.107,4079.708,And what classrooms look like and feel like.,50,,
669,0.97,4079.708,4081.777,It is really the how.,50,,
670,0.97,4081.777,4086.382,"Who is doing that, teaching.",50,,
671,0.97,4086.382,4086.949,What it feels like.,50,,
672,0.97,4086.949,4099.061,Do they feel like it is culturally responsive to their lives and their identities and all of those are important parts of the creative advantage.,50,,
673,0.97,4099.061,4099.962,The key are these goals.,50,,
674,0.97,4099.962,4104.767,All people have high quality arts education.,50,,
675,0.97,4104.767,4113.776,"No matter what their race, social economic status or neighborhood is.",50,,
676,0.97,4113.776,4121.75,"That they get instruction from arts teachers, art integrated.",50,,
677,0.97,4121.75,4133.229,People who look like them bringing art forms that are not present currently and they have these connections like my colleague Alex is working on around connections to careers in the arts.,50,,
678,0.97,4133.229,4137.199,So part of what we are doing is pulling together pathways of schools.,50,,
679,0.97,4137.199,4141.403,We are looking at racial equity data with them.,50,,
680,0.97,4141.403,4144.106,Pooling Thedata of who has access.,50,,
681,0.97,4144.106,4150.279,Who is participating in arts classes currently and helping those schools in those pathways create arts plans.,50,,
682,0.97,4150.279,4157.786,We are giving them three years worth of funding to start.,50,,
683,0.97,4157.786,4164.627,That Aligns with looking at those gaps.,50,,
684,0.97,4164.627,4173.068,"After they use their three years of funding up, there is Sustainability funds available for them to continue and try new things as well.",50,,
685,0.97,4173.068,4181.744,And we have lots of evidence that shows this initiative is working.,50,,
686,0.97,4181.744,4184.079,We are currently in 81 schools as of this year.,50,,
687,0.97,4184.079,4195.157,And we have been rolling out neighborhood Pathway to neighborhood Pathway starting with the highest need schools.,50,,
688,0.97,4195.157,4198.16,We will be in the entire district.,50,,
689,0.97,4198.16,4202.932,"55,000 students within the next year or two depending on the Covid times.",50,,
690,0.97,4202.932,4213.142,"And, how schools maybe feel ready to pick up their arts or not.",50,,
691,0.97,4213.142,4223.752,"During Covid, we were able to have Online videos with some of our community partners.",50,,
692,0.97,4223.752,4224.987,To keep the arts alive.,50,,
693,0.97,4224.987,4229.692,Thanks so much for the opportunity to share.,50,,
694,0.97,4229.692,4240.269,We look forward to completing this phase of it and continuing to support schools beyond right now.,50,,
695,0.97,4240.269,4244.84,That was great.,51,,
696,0.97,4244.84,4254.183,I will now introduce Matthew Richter to talk about the cultural space agency and how the community brought back the slate of Councilmembers.,51,,
697,0.97,4254.183,4254.883,Thanks Calandra.,52,,
698,0.97,4254.883,4255.551,"Hi again, Councilmembers.",52,,
699,0.97,4255.551,4261.223,Thanks to all the Councilmembers and guests.,52,,
700,0.97,4261.223,4263.559,"I'm Matthew Richter, the cultural space liaison.",52,,
701,0.97,4263.559,4266.929,And helping to shepherd the launch of the cultural space agency.,52,,
702,0.97,4266.929,4272.401,I'm actually the interim director now of the cultural space agency as well.,52,,
703,0.97,4272.401,4280.409,The cultural space agency as everyone on the call knows is new public development authority launched by the city of Seattle this past year.,52,,
704,0.97,4280.409,4288.55,It is a values based mission driven cultural real estate development company.,52,,
705,0.97,4288.55,4293.088,It is a strategy for community building and Anti-Racism.,52,,
706,0.97,4293.088,4300.963,It uses the instrument of cultural space to build on those strategies and initiatives.,52,,
707,0.97,4300.963,4313.709,I will talk specifically about process that we went through for the creation of a slate of nominees.,52,,
708,0.97,4313.709,4319.381,"When you hear governing Council in your ears I guess, you hear board of directors in your mind.",52,,
709,0.97,4319.381,4325.521,Governing Council is to a public development authority what a board of directors is to nonprofit organization.,52,,
710,0.97,4325.521,4335.497,The form most people are more used to.,52,,
711,0.97,4335.497,4341.37,I'll talk about what typically happens.,52,,
712,0.97,4341.37,4344.807,City Council appoints unilaterally the members.,52,,
713,0.97,4344.807,4358.587,The Mayor's office gets unilateral placement of governing Councilmembers and the governing counsel themselves comes up with the remaining seats.,52,,
714,0.97,4358.587,4368.964,We wanted to ensure the Governance of the cultural space agency was rooted in the communities they were designed to serve.,52,,
715,0.97,4368.964,4372.568,"And, the leadership of those communities as well.",52,,
716,0.97,4372.568,4388.083,We are talking communities that have been the most impacted by displacement and by the Racialized aspects of constitutional racism and by the the work this organization is designed to address.,52,,

819,0.97,4993.088,5002.697,I want to step back and talk a little bit about how we evolved our demographic policy.,57,,
820,0.97,5002.697,5014.376,Demographics are not going to tell the whole story about how far we have gotten in terms of our race and social justice here at the office of arts and cultures.,57,,
821,0.97,5014.376,5028.556,"It is one of the tools for us to continue to be monitoring, assessing and being transparent, especially toward communities most impacted by structural racism.",57,,
822,0.97,5028.556,5036.264,"And the theme of this particular portion is alignment, alignment, alignment.",57,,
823,0.97,5036.264,5048.643,So our racial categories are now office wide more so aligned than they have been in the past.,57,,
824,0.97,5048.643,5053.748,We are still using the same categories and terminology.,57,,
825,0.97,5053.748,5064.059,In terms of number of artists being supported.,57,,
826,0.97,5064.059,5064.592,Cultural organizations.,57,,

828,0.97,5065.026,5065.427,It is consistent.,57,,
829,0.97,5065.427,5071.8,And I think that is a huge step in the right direction.,57,,
830,0.97,5071.8,5077.005,In terms of this body of work.,57,,
831,0.97,5077.005,5081.309,"These are forms, forms of our community facing.",57,,
832,0.97,5081.309,5102.73,"We require that race, gender, and place or geography are collected as required and then Optionally some of our programmatic work surrounds Homeowner ship, rental status, housing status.",57,,
833,0.97,5102.73,5105.667,Languages other than English and so on.,57,,
834,0.97,5105.667,5110.405,"Just because sometimes, we want a fuller picture of who we are able to support.",57,,
835,0.97,5110.405,5118.947,"And, just so that you know all know, this is voluntary information that is anonymously Aggregately shared.",57,,
836,0.97,5118.947,5123.718,And it is based on Self- reported data.,57,,
837,0.97,5123.718,5132.527,Any information we get about students is from third parties.,57,,
838,0.97,5132.527,5134.362,From the creative advantage.,57,,
839,0.97,5134.362,5139.434,"So, we aggravate this information by Grantees.",57,,
840,0.97,5139.434,5141.87,"Public artists, cultural organizations.",57,,
841,0.97,5141.87,5150.678,"And, we are evolving what it means to identify organizational demographics as a whole.",57,,
842,0.97,5150.678,5153.915,New body of work for us.,57,,
843,0.97,5153.915,5163.825,We want to make sure our staff and communities reflect representational diversity.,57,,
844,0.97,5163.825,5165.66,"So, how is this information being used?",57,,
845,0.97,5165.66,5179.44,"So, if you are a part of a selection process, which is how we primarily rely upon making decisions about who gets awards and opportunities.",57,,
846,0.97,5179.44,5204.299,"So, a panel of experts and jurors are presented with aggregate data about communities that are reflected.",57,,
847,0.97,5205.333,5207.902,How we inform strategic work.,57,,
848,0.97,5207.902,5209.737,And newer emergent organizational demographics.,57,,
849,0.97,5209.737,5211.272,"So, I have three examples.",57,,
850,0.97,5211.272,5218.58,But only one slide that shows those by practice.,57,,
851,0.97,5218.58,5227.355,This table here shows our investments Aggregated by racial categories.,57,,
852,0.97,5227.355,5233.494,"And, it is a mixture of individuals or organizations or groups.",57,,
853,0.97,5233.494,5235.263,Sometimes they are informal groups.,57,,
854,0.97,5235.263,5251.079,"You will notice that one divergence we have is that we want to know about Middle Eastern, North African, that's a departure from the 2020 census act.",57,,
855,0.97,5251.079,5255.717,This is our information that we coded last year.,57,,
856,0.97,5255.717,5257.619,Based on the previous year's investments.,57,,
857,0.97,5257.619,5261.956,It was a pretty labor intensive process.,57,,
858,0.97,5261.956,5265.226,There is something of a lag time.,57,,
859,0.97,5265.226,5266.928,It is a really important exercise.,57,,
860,0.97,5266.928,5273.801,And we are doing it now for 2020.,57,,
861,0.97,5273.801,5274.269,And for 2021.,57,,
862,0.97,5274.269,5282.71,There is always a little bit of a delay in annual reporting.,57,,
863,0.97,5282.71,5288.549,So we know we want to do better.,57,,
864,0.97,5288.549,5298.092,"Especially, there could be some more support for certain groups that are not showing up here.",57,,
865,0.97,5298.092,5302.93,"Specifically a flag, native Pacific Islander communities.",57,,
866,0.97,5302.93,5303.431,Samoan communities.,57,,
867,0.97,5303.431,5304.465,"Middle Eastern, North African communities.",57,,
868,0.97,5304.465,5311.773,There can be a lot more support there.,57,,
869,0.97,5311.773,5320.048,But the resources are what they are.,57,,
870,0.97,5320.048,5323.951,Showing you the actually data tables has to do with the creative advantage.,57,,
871,0.97,5323.951,5331.259,"The program that Tina, my colleague here just talked about with community arts partnership with Seattle public schools.",57,,
872,0.97,5331.259,5341.703,We do feel very confident knowing that our teaching artists are primarily Bipoc.,57,,

874,0.97,5351.012,5359.354,"We want to know that they are, that young people are seeing themselves reflected in who is for them in the classroom.",57,,
875,0.97,5359.354,5375.737,"So, 12 out of 14 of the individuals were Bipoc teaching artists.",57,,
876,0.97,5375.737,5379.741,If you include cultural organizations.,57,,
877,0.97,5379.741,5379.907,15.,57,,
878,0.97,5379.907,5381.142,With the kind of questions we pose.,57,,
879,0.97,5381.142,5392.186,"So, that is one of the ways, one of the many tools at our disposal to understand.",57,,
880,0.97,5392.186,5395.156,We have that information Segmented by race.,57,,
881,0.97,5395.156,5402.43,I'm not going to go into it.,57,,
882,0.97,5402.43,5405.233,The same apply to other bodies of work.,57,,
883,0.97,5405.233,5405.9,Public art.,57,,
884,0.97,5405.9,5407.969,Who is getting these commissions.,57,,
885,0.97,5407.969,5419.947,And public art is a very unique field.,57,,
886,0.97,5419.947,5421.549,It heavily majority white.,57,,
887,0.97,5421.549,5429.957,There have been studies about representation.,57,,
888,0.97,5429.957,5432.26,We know representation has doubled.,57,,
889,0.97,5432.26,5434.429,Opportunities have increased.,57,,
890,0.97,5434.429,5443.838,"But, we know that our representation is fairly consistent.",57,,
891,0.97,5443.838,5446.641,So that is another way of knowing for us.,57,,
892,0.97,5446.641,5452.814,That is kind of a really brief Snapshot.,57,,
893,0.97,5452.814,5457.218,"Obviously, the stories really matter.",57,,
894,0.97,5457.218,5461.956,"And, place matters.",57,,

928,0.97,5630.458,5633.094,We are going to move on.,63,,
929,0.97,5633.094,5639.3,We have two items left on the agenda.,63,,
930,0.97,5639.3,5647.208,"So, will you read item 7 into the record?",63,,
931,0.97,5647.208,5648.376,Council bill 120162.,64,,
932,0.97,5648.376,5654.915,An ordinance establishing a new 15th Avenue East business improvement area.,64,,
933,0.97,5654.915,5658.352,Levying special assessments upon owners of commercial property.,64,,
934,0.97,5658.352,5661.055,Multifamily residential property and mixed use property within the area.,64,,
935,0.97,5661.055,5672.466,Providing for the deposit of revenues in a special account and expenditures there providing for a collection of and penalties for Delinquencies.,64,,
936,0.97,5672.466,5675.736,Providing for the establishment of a Bia advisory board.,64,,
937,0.97,5675.736,5680.274,Providing for an implementation agreement with the program manager.,64,,
938,0.97,5680.274,5684.779,"And, ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.",64,,
939,0.97,5684.779,5688.149,"For briefing, discussion, and possible vote.",64,,
940,0.97,5688.149,5688.716,Thank you.,65,,
941,0.97,5688.716,5693.454,I will be sure next time to ask you to read the short title so you don't have to go through all that.,65,,
942,0.97,5693.454,5706.3,"Colleagues, this is the bill, as you know, we discussed in the last committee meeting on September 8. we heard from the proponents of the bi.",65,,
943,0.97,5706.3,5722.95,"At that time, I indicated I would work on an amendment on preserving small business and make sure commercial tenants are included on the board.",65,,
944,0.97,5722.95,5726.52,So I have asked central staff to craft and amendment.,65,,
945,0.97,5726.52,5743.738,It was one minor change they suggested so I will hand it to Yolanda from Council central staff to describe the changes on the amendment.,65,,
946,0.97,5743.738,5750.778,"So, amendment one, version one is attached to the agenda.",66,,
947,0.97,5750.778,5758.419,But I circulated 1A which had a minor technical clarifying change.,66,,
948,0.97,5758.419,5769.897,Program areas to add economic development activities allowed as per state statute.,66,,
949,0.97,5769.897,5778.339,Would require at least two of the board members the business tenants subject to a triple net lease.,66,,
950,0.97,5778.339,5797.191,Just the difference between version 1 and 1A is the program activities to prevent small businesses being displaced would fall within the allowed uses of Bia assessment revenues as described by the state statute.,66,,
951,0.97,5797.191,5802.296,Are there any questions about the amendment?,67,,
952,0.97,5802.296,5807.835,Wanted to make sure everyone had a chance to hear from Yolanda.,67,,
953,0.97,5807.835,5808.235,Thank you again.,67,,
954,0.97,5808.235,5817.978,"So again, just to try to clarify that the intent is there to address economic development.",67,,
955,0.97,5817.978,5819.847,To encourage preservation of small business.,67,,
956,0.97,5819.847,5823.25,But keep in line with what the state requires.,67,,
957,0.97,5823.25,5832.026,"So, if there are no questions, then I will move to adopt the proposed amendment 1A that was recently distributed.",67,,
958,0.97,5832.026,5835.296,Is there a second?,67,,

979,0.97,5888.749,5888.949,Okay.,81,,
980,0.97,5888.949,5899.66,"In that case, Councilmembers, I'm going to move that the committee recommends passage as amended.",81,,

985,0.97,5904.231,5910.471,Will the clerk call the roll on the passage of the bill?,83,,

988,0.97,5913.307,5917.645,Councilmember Lewis?,86,,
989,0.97,5917.645,5917.878,Aye.,87,,
990,0.97,5917.878,5919.28,Councilmember Pedersen.,88,,

999,0.97,5936.864,5947.708,"Okay, last item for us is item number 8. the short title of item 8 into the record.",96,,
1000,0.97,5947.708,5949.677,"Item 8, council bill 120180.",97,,
1001,0.97,5949.677,5958.052,In ordinance related to human rights including protections against discrimination based on citizenship and immigration status.,97,,
1002,0.97,5958.052,5963.624,Adding a definition of race for certain purposes.,97,,
1003,0.97,5963.624,5970.164,"And, amending the various sections of the Seattle municipal code.",97,,
1004,0.97,5970.164,5973.967,"For briefing, discussion, and possible vote.",97,,
1005,0.97,5973.967,5974.535,Great.,98,,
1006,0.97,5974.535,5975.302,Thank you very much.,98,,
1007,0.97,5975.302,5978.572,"Colleagues, I will hand this over to Asha.",98,,
1008,0.97,5978.572,5984.144,"As I understand it, we have a little more work to do on this so we will not vote on it.",98,,
1009,0.97,5984.144,6003.797,I did want Asha to give us the context on this so we can consider a December vote once our budget process is over.,98,,
1010,0.97,6003.797,6004.865,I'm Asha Venkataraman.,99,,
1011,0.97,6004.865,6005.699,This is 120180 Council bill.,99,,
1012,0.97,6005.699,6023.15,It is a bill that is adding several protected classes added to the Washington law against discrimination in 2020 to Seattle's municipal code.,99,,
1013,0.97,6023.15,6031.358,Currently the office of civil rights enforces against violations protecting a variety of classes.,99,,
1014,0.97,6031.358,6037.698,So Seattle's protective classes are much more numerous than what is in state protection.,99,,
1015,0.97,6037.698,6047.708,That allows the office of civil right to enforce a variety of violations.,99,,
1016,0.97,6047.708,6059.286,"So in 2020, the state Legislature passed several bills to amend the Washington law against discrimination.",99,,
1017,0.97,6059.286,6072.332,"Those added in protections based on citizenship and immigration status and including a definition of race, specifically to include protected hair styles.",99,,
1018,0.97,6072.332,6086.079,The last piece was to allow an exemption from those laws when other laws required discrimination based.,99,,
1019,0.97,6086.079,6100.06,"So, those, the Washington law against discrimination including those protections are enforced at the state level by the Washington state human rights Commission.",99,,
1020,0.97,6100.06,6106.867,So this would incorporate the protected classes into the code.,99,,
1021,0.97,6106.867,6108.602,In titles 3 and 14.,99,,
1022,0.97,6108.602,6117.344,"The titles that the office for civil rights, that give them jurisdiction.",99,,
1023,0.97,6117.344,6125.886,"And describe their jurisdiction to enforce protections in housing employment, pub welcome accommodations and contracting.",99,,
1024,0.97,6125.886,6138.131,"And so, with the addition of these classes to the city's code, will allow the office of civil rights to enforce.",99,,
1025,0.97,6138.131,6157.417,"If the office doesn't pass this bill and Endup adding these protected classes to the Seattle code, that leaves only the state human rights Commission to be enforcing violations of the Washington law against discrimination.",99,,
1026,0.97,6157.417,6163.724,I will pause if there are questions about the content of the bill and move into fiscal considerations.,99,,
1027,0.97,6163.724,6170.03,Any questions up to this point?,100,,
1028,0.97,6170.03,6172.933,I do have questions about considerations but please go ahead.,101,,
1029,0.97,6172.933,6189.249,One of the things U noted in the memo is whether Council wants to consider adding some funds to the office of civil rights to do education and outreach.,102,,
1030,0.97,6189.249,6201.628,"Some of it mentioned describes how the Council has previously passed legislation, that creates new protections that the office for civil rights will enforce.",102,,
1031,0.97,6201.628,6207.768,It has adopted some one Time- out reach.,102,,
1032,0.97,6207.768,6212.272,To do some education in the community so people know they have rights.,102,,
1033,0.97,6212.272,6216.577,"Because of the way enforcement works, it was a complaints based system.",102,,
1034,0.97,6216.577,6221.048,"So, people essentially need to know their right to be able to exercise them.",102,,
1035,0.97,6221.048,6229.856,"And so, the outreach and education piece can be important.",102,,
1036,0.97,6229.856,6242.836,"The memo highlights that it is something to consider in the budget process for the 2022 budget to provide for example something like $50,000 to be outreach and education.",102,,
1037,0.97,6242.836,6248.875,"Currently, it is not clear what the case load increase will be like for the enforcement division.",102,,
1038,0.97,6248.875,6252.646,"So, it doesn't necessarily make sense to add enforcement staff at this point.",102,,
1039,0.97,6252.646,6267.127,"But, if it turns out that this protection in combination with the other protections of the Council is passed over several years increases an enforcement workload, they may want to consider at some future point adding enforcement staff as well.",102,,
1040,0.97,6267.127,6279.239,"So, I will pause at that point for questions on this piece.",102,,
1041,0.97,6279.239,6282.009,"I have questions, Asha.",103,,
1042,0.97,6282.009,6283.076,There are 18 protective classes.,103,,
1043,0.97,6283.076,6285.078,I don't know if this counts as two or three more.,103,,
1044,0.97,6285.078,6294.855,"I know that every time we add a new protective class, it does increase the work for the folks that are Cr.",103,,
1045,0.97,6294.855,6303.263,"And so, what I'm trying to understand is if we have any sense of the impact.",103,,
1046,0.97,6303.263,6306.867,I know you said we don't know yet what the impact will be.,103,,
1047,0.97,6306.867,6307.968,The degree to the impact.,103,,
1048,0.97,6307.968,6331.324,"But, do we have a sense of what the typical impact is when we add a protected class for enforcement, and for investigation when there is more things for the folks over to be doing.",103,,
1049,0.97,6331.324,6334.861,"In general, it does add investigations.",104,,
1050,0.97,6334.861,6335.929,It does add enforcement cases.,104,,
1051,0.97,6335.929,6341.968,The difficult part to figure out is at what point it requires a whole new person.,104,,
1052,0.97,6341.968,6351.011,"And so, some of the analysis that we will do during at least the budget process will look at what things like enforcement Backlogs are.",104,,
1053,0.97,6351.011,6369.396,And see if those have increased over what the average is over the past couple of years and it will take a look at things like what the case load is for enforcement staff and if that is something that has been increasing to something that is an untenable load and stayed relatively constant.,104,,
1054,0.97,6369.396,6374.868,That is information that we will get when the budget comes in on Monday.,104,,
1055,0.97,6374.868,6384.544,Through some of the Prebudget questions we ask from year to year on that piece.,104,,
1056,0.97,6384.544,6388.548,I will have more information as it comes in next week.,104,,
1057,0.97,6388.548,6388.949,Great.,105,,
1058,0.97,6388.949,6398.158,This is a bigger discussion for Offline.,105,,
1059,0.97,6398.158,6404.931,"When we do something like this, we need to include education in outreach so they have this new protection.",105,,
1060,0.97,6404.931,6417.01,"And given that this is currently a complete based system, I would be interested in understanding a little bit better, what an alternative is to a complaint based system.",105,,
1061,0.97,6417.01,6429.189,"And if that is, if there is anything like that now on the city level, if that is something we want to think about moving toward at some date.",105,,
1062,0.97,6429.189,6429.556,Absolutely.,106,,
1063,0.97,6429.556,6433.593,The one that come to my mind is the office of labor standards.,106,,
1064,0.97,6433.593,6448.809,"Which can do, I believe they are called company wide Investigaions so they initiate investigations into companies based on information they have or based on some testing.",106,,
1065,0.97,6448.809,6455.715,That is not the model they have.,106,,
1066,0.97,6455.715,6464.925,But we can talk about adding that Department initiated investigation and what kind of resources it would take to do that.,106,,
1067,0.97,6464.925,6465.225,Okay.,107,,
1068,0.97,6465.225,6465.592,Thank you.,108,,
