25,0.97,188.121,234.0,"We also found out and shared it--I shared this with Councilmember Herbold as well, the 20 lives we have lost SINC we marched with the Ingram students in March to Red square after the Parkland shooting, so I want to thank my colleagues, particularly a huge shout out t our communications staff Emma folks, Jesse and Joseph who WER there to make sure that the speakers were up . people were welcomed . We worked with the students . We also had members of the Seattle public school board . We also heard from our deputy Mayor and our director.",20,,
26,0.97,234.0,235.468,So this issue will not go away.,20,,
27,0.97,235.468,243.743,"It's going to continue . So I am hoping we could have more space and more opportunity to hear from these young folks who, as you know, will soon be voters.",20,,
28,0.97,243.743,272.505,"Hopefully, we can change this horrific thing where children get guns and go to school and kill other children . So thank you . I'm sorry I'm a little bit emotional about that . that's kind of the Vibe we are all feeling down here today at City Hall . So thank you, Madam chair",20,,
29,0.97,272.505,379.078,"Absolutely . Thank you, Council President . Thank you fo representing the full council I your welcoming comments and for all the students and their heroic efforts to organize to demand more than thoughts and prayers, incredible organizing and show of support they received for today . We will get into the outline of the select budget committee balancing package in a moment . But especially in the last week as students have begun organizing and formulating items they would like to see in terms of investments from city, County, state, and congressional representatives, we have worked very hard over the last 72 hour to make some final additions to the budget . We wanted to flag for all of you a part of the Liberations and discussions we will have today, we include highlighting we are making a NE investment, a new investment of specifically allocating an additive $3 million across the biennium specifically for mental health services for use in high school . This will be part of the School-Based health clinic investments, and with this new and additive funding W have been able to secure from under program funding that I pulled out from Jumpstart's administrative Fund, putting commitments into action, recognizing that this is a critical investment area, I worked very hard to make sure W had additional funding that we could squeeze out of the administrative category from Jumpstart so we could keep our proposed balancing package balanced in the last few days but but ensured there was additional funding going forward for mental health School-Based clinics and specifically for high school students in School-Based health clinics . This is funding that goes to the Department of education and early learning . I guess--gets passed on to School-Based health clinics.",21,,
30,0.97,379.078,413.546,"Again, the total investment for School-Based health clinics would be a $.9 billion in 2023 and $9.1 million in 2024. I wil acknowledge as well this is not enough . This is a down payment this is a significant Investmen in this initial balancing package but we will continue to work to do more and also in partnership with other levels O government as we seek to Addres not just these student demands but the growing call for action across our country as we continue to see gun violence be pervasive in the United States.",21,,
31,0.97,413.546,552.919,"Thanks again, Council president for your words this morning . An to the students for all the organizing . all right, colleagues, we are here at the select budget committee meeting to go through the balancing package . I just want to make sure I didn't hear somebody raising their hand . Okay . We AR here to go through the select budget committee balancing package . It has been published thank you to Patty . The information is available Online as of this morning . We did have an opportunity to walk through the proposed balancing package with members of the press and have a technical briefing as well . Thank you to members of the audience . For folks who are not muted, I will ask you to double check that you are muted if you are not interested in speaking . and at the technical briefing, we did have the opportunity to answer a set of questions . But I look forward t answering your questions workin with central staff today to help unpack the initial balancing package we put in front of us and to begin the process of considering your feedback as well as possible amendments . I want to start wit this . I want to center us on th living economic uncertainty and heightened inflation, the instability that was really underscored in the November revenue forecast . that was just two weeks ago . two weeks ago, the city council received this dire economic forecast projecting a net $64 million decrease, a net $9.4 million decrease in general Fund, $4.5 million decrease in sugary Swee beverage revenues . that was on top of the already existing operating deficit, 2023 alone was $141 million in operating deficit that we had to account for in a balance package . and today we are unveiling a Packag that I believe centers Anti-Austerity measures, Focuse on historic investments and affordable housing at Addressin homelessness, and Prioritizes a city of the future through investments and climate resilience, small business, and supporting our most vulnerable.",21,,
32,0.97,552.919,618.985,"Over the past seven Wâ–ˆEeks the Council has engaged in creating dialogue about the Mayor's proposed budget, convened to public hearings, eight public meetings, listened to hundreds of community members and Council members themselves have proposed 100 amendments . that constant dialogue informed the budget that is in front of us today . We will work together to finalize it . But I believe that this foundation in the Balancin package SETS us up to have a budget that invests in core and emerging needs . I want to thank you all for the ideas that you brought forward, the Brainstorming you have done wit my office and central staff, an for the community for their feedback and their ideas . We AR revealing a balancing package that I believe REJECTS Austerit and Prioritizes keeping our community cared for, housed, connected, resilient, healthy, and safe . I would say that ther are no easy answers baked into how to address the budget Crisi and the shortfall that we see.",21,,
33,0.97,618.985,629.762,"There are a Plethora of service needed to address the growing trauma and stress that our community continues to struggle with . While there were no easy answers, there were core values to start from to build this proposed budget in front of us.",21,,
34,0.97,629.762,645.578,"That includes accountability an transparency, investing in key and core city services for working families and smallest businesses, and preventing clips in services and avoiding austerity measures to ensure that we are resilient in the wake of this situation we are currently facing, that we Emerg more equitable and more just.",21,,
35,0.97,645.578,712.578,"Much of the 2023 and 2024 budget investments protect Stakeholder policies and Balanc with the support from higher than anticipated revenue from the historic Jumpstart progressive payroll tax that we passed in 2020. and also uses short-term uses of the short-term rental tax and transportation network tax to help balance this budget . As you will hear, colleagues, this balancing package immediately ends the use of those revenue strategies after two years . It immediately ends the temporary use of these funds at the end O the biennium to allow for investments to grow and affordable housing, green new deal, transit investment and equitable initiatives as Jumpstart and Tmc and Short-Ter rental taxes had originally bee envisioned . This is why it is so important for us to have th economic revenue stabilization task force be successful in their efforts to come up with strategies for the Council to collectively deploy in the upcoming year . for this budget I was focused on three pillars.",21,,
36,0.97,712.578,752.318,"As we looked at the Mayor's proposed budget, I continued to try to keep us focused on the categories I mentioned . cared for and housed, this makes sure we are investing in homeless services, tenant connections, then connected and resilient, that means equitable growth, clean, livable, connected communities, and Sustainability and investing in green new deal investments to protect our environment and our local economy . and finally, health an safety, Investingin community health, community safety, traditional public safety as well as alternatives like investments upstream.",21,,
37,0.97,752.318,943.175,"Investments that are youth needed, like the folks we saw today, gun violence prevention, health investments, Educationa opportunities and investments for our entire community in art and culture . We had to make tough choices in this budget t balance . I cannot underscore that more . We had to make very tough choices to make about revenue situation that you all heard earlier this month balance . But I did so by being thoughtful and Deliberative . I hope that you see in this proposed budget that I have identified and Prioritized programs and services that Coul have had cliffs, reductions or end when ongoing need is still present in our community . For investing in New pilots or new programs or initiatives that Di not provide a direct service or direct care in this moment of increased need, we had to put some of those on hold . Regardin addressing the real estate tax shortfall, we similarly had to look at projects and spending categories for infrastructure, transportation, large capital projects . If they did not have dedicated projects in development, already initiated or fully planned, some of those did have to go on hold . But in every way I tried to move us forward . I would move us forward and move away from Majo policy decisions that did not need to be embedded in this budget process . I believe that this is not the year for major policy changes or policy distinctions that move us away from already established strategies in the midst of economic uncertainty . This is the year for taking the temperature down, D Politicizin policy choices, and really bein intentional about our actions tied to the budget so we can collectively address the shortfall and invest in our cities pressing needs . So again, if something was new or not fully developed, we did Hav to put a hold on some of those things, but that's not an indication that they were not good ideas, and similar to Councilmember priorities, many of you had suggested strategies you would like to see incorporated in the budget, not including them is not necessarily an indication of no supporting . We absolutely had t Prioritize basic necessities versus nice to Haves or shifting to predetermined policy . I applied the same lens across departments for consistency . So if it was not tied to the existing statute, there was a major shift in policy, if it would benefit fro a larger discussion, if it wasn't furthering something Tha was already indicated as a potential Pathway forward that had the majority of support, I tried to hold back on those actions for future thoughtful deliberation in partnership wit you all, the Mayor's office, impacted parties, and the community . that is true from everything from revenue to policy choices . So we did have to say no to some things . and I hope you will see is that over the last few weeks, with the help of central staff and all O your feedback, we hope to find a common ground . In some ways, this is not a Feel-Good budget.",21,,
38,0.97,943.175,1026.592,"It cannot be in the midst of economic downturn . But overall, I feel good about the policy decisions that we have made in this initial balancing package and how we balance budget investments and policy priorities . So I want to thank all the folks who made it possible for this to come together, the community for their patience as we work with an additional week to try to adjust for the decline to staff in my office . We spent hours in Roundtables and meetings with members, your teams, and member of the community to make sure that we were pulling Fâ–ˆRom the leadership community and folks affected, so thanks to chief of staff, policy director, operations manager, and policy analyst in my office for their incredible work . and I hope folks tuned in this morning to see some of the initial comment that were made about the balancing package in my release comments . But this would not have been possible without the incredibly brilliant work of th nonpartisan analyst from Centra staff . Under the leadership of Esther handy and the budget Lea who worked with the entire central staff team, crunched th numbers, composed amendment wit all of you, worked with the budget office and departments along with all the sponsors to include as many of your policy directives as possible for the items that we are including in the budget in front of us.",21,,
39,0.97,1027.76,1115.38,"Importantly, I think there is a notable change and a contrast I recent years . I want to thank Mayor Harold . I want to thank him for the collaboration and partnership with his team, with the city budget office, and wit the entire Department teams wh are dedicated to looking at the budget in these times . that collaboration with our office, my office, central staff, and with CBO and the Mayor's office it is very much appreciated . I is in the midst of this ongoing stress we see a growing community and the local economy that SEES greater instability that we need to come together, solve these tough problems, com up with Beta solutions, and recognize as well that doing so still appreciates and respects that we are different branches of government, separate but equal branches of government, but in these times, on tough issues, we have tried to come together to address policy and revenue needs to redirect some of those revenue needs in these unprecedented times to ensure that our growing needs in the city are addressed . We have an open, honest, transparent conversation as we are jointly concerned about the closest revenue gap . I look forward to continuing to work with you colleagues to make sure we protect the most vulnerable, protect from cliffs and program services, layoffs, and austerity . We buoy our local economy by investing in core city services which help us as the public sector, sustains hardship letter, and help the private sector read on faster.",21,,
40,0.97,1115.38,1166.198,"That is proven . that's what we looked at when we passed Jumpstart . It is still true today . We must continue to invest in core city services in order to not only protect the most vulnerable but to help our private and public sector sustain economic downturn . ther are decisions in the budget Tha have been discussed openly with many of you . I appreciate your confidence . for those who we worked with and maintain the confidence to help us figure Ou a way to work forward, to address items in the budget, an I am really excited we were Abl to include some additional item in the last few days in partnership with the Mayor's office, thank you again to deputy Mayor Washington, the Mayor himself, and the city budget office for their collaboration as we work to crunch these last numbers, but it truly is a heroic effort.",21,,
41,0.97,1166.198,1199.064,"Central staff is able to put this all together so our values priorities, and the imminence W have agreed to so far are reflected in this budget . I am very excited to turn it over t the team at central staff .

O September 28, budget office director Julie provided an overview of the budget . The Council then hosted Department hearings in October followed by a discussion of possible amendments to the proposed budget and the balancing Packag we will brief on today . There I a compilation of those amendments proposed by Online Councilmembers and put together by budget chair mosquito . There will be an opportunity to review this on November of 21.",24,,
51,0.97,1439.738,1461.726,"Next slide? this, again, budget chair twin 22 covered it officially on the screen, a public hearing tomorrow, Councilmember proposals are due by Wednesday at noon . and vote on amendments next Wednesday.",24,,
52,0.97,1461.726,1632.263,"Next slide? and here is our agenda for today . So we are going to cover initial issues proposed in the budget, I will provide the briefest overview O the revenue forecast . We will take a look at a few tables on the balancing package by investment area, then talk Abou some of the resource specific spends in this plan . and then, we will turn it over to our tea and go to my section house and care for . We will read in each of the amendments in that section, Council members will have a chance to ask questions about those . great . The first was, relates to human service contracts issued by the city as we had discussed extensively in this Committee, current law requires Hsd to inflate service provider contracts annually based on the consumer price index for urban wage earners an clerical workers, call that the CP Iw . that is the inflationary rate for 2023, 7.6%, and the forecast is 24.7% . The Executiv proposed change to the law Woul increase at 4% . and this balancing package follows current law and provides the full inflationary increase on these contracts . Second, the proposed policy changes to several funds, including the short-term rental tax and the transportation network Companie fund to reflect changes in state law, provided so we can get opportunities to balance th budget . those changes are largely retained in this budget . The most significant policy changes were to the Jumpstart fund that would change the current formula for spending the Jumpstart Fund and allow more revenue to be used in the general fund to address the operating deficit in Perpetuity we will look at a table on Jumpstart funds later in the presentation . I will NOTE here the balancing package recommend passage of an ordinance that would allow the Jumpstart Fund and general fund of approximately $30 million Highe than anticipated revenues in 2022 . 71 million of 2023 projected revenues, and 80 million of 2024 projected revenues over in 2024. and then Finally, the other big policy change that came with the budge was that earlier this year, th city's 120 member parking enforcement unit was moved from the police Department to the Department of transportation.",24,,
53,0.97,1632.263,1768.199,"The executive proposed to transfer them back to the Polic Department, and this balancing package retains the enforcement unit at the Department of transportation . It makes an immediate investment to support parking enforcement officers such as funding to allow full use of overtime, uniforms, and some Nonlabor direct costs, and asks the interdepartmental team that includes representatives O the Council, executive and parking enforcement unit to Mak a recommendation by April 15th about the permanent home . next slide, as we were understanding the budget and thinking about those issues, the city received an updated November revenue forecast that reduced revenues by $80 million over the biennium . I'm just going to briefly cover two slides from the office of economic and revenue forecast both for the Council and for the public to better understand what this change is about . As inflation has stayed high, the Fed has responded by continuing to increase interest rates with th intent to cool the economy . th short story is, it appears to B having an impact . This first slide looks nationally . the summer forecasts resumed we would be at a place of modest economic growth in 2023, 49% growth, and that has changed to forecast that we are entering a mild recession, assuming the economy will contract by 0.5% next year . These are employment numbers . If you look at the Redline at the beginning, that' the start of a pandemic . You ca see a sharp drop in employment in 2020. you can see that we have climbed out of that, and we have returned to Pre-Pandemi employment levels . The pink LIN projected what the budget was built upon, employment would slowly grow over 2023 and 2024 the bright red line shows instead the beginning of a drop of implement in 2023. the next slide looks at that regionally.",24,,
54,0.97,1768.199,1795.627,"It is a similar shape . We see a similar drop in employment during the pandemic, climb out of that, the light pink line shows what was projected as employment, a slow and steady growth in 2023 and 2024, and th bright red shows the current forecast where we see Employmen drop in 2023. the construction sector is a significant part of the local projected slowdown.",24,,
55,0.97,1795.627,1885.85,"It is part of the impact on our revenues . the next slide shows what the overall impact looks like . The first is a $9.4 million reduction in the genera fund over the biennium . It is driven by drops in property tax due to the construction . sales and BNO are the other two significant players here . As you think about a loss of employment and appeared loss I consumer demand, a note for th Council, a $9.4 million Decreas over the biennium on the $1.6 billion budget, it's not great, particularly in the operating deficit, but on its own, it's not a crisis . that part of this forecast could've been Solvable the larger challenge is the REA estate exercise task . The proposed budget was built on an assumption of 10 $6 million in 2022, and 95 million in 2023 an 2024, each year . Those forecast dropped by 25% for a total loss of 64 million dollars over the biennium . This was a tax on REA estate transactions, and the changes driven both by a projected drop in prices and seeing fewer transactions in th market.",24,,
56,0.97,1889.554,1891.89,"Excuse me, can I ask a quick question? I am sorry.",25,,
57,0.97,1891.89,1895.56,Yes . I apologize as well . I can't see everybody on screen today . razor hand or jump in.,26,,
58,0.97,1895.56,1896.361,"Council member, go ahead.",26,,
59,0.97,1896.361,1901.232,"Thank you, Esther . I want Yo to back up again . I know the 10 6 million drop and then the Nex number was?",27,,
60,0.97,1901.232,1903.234,"95, 106 was the 2022 number.",28,,
61,0.97,1903.234,1912.443,95 was what was built into the 2023 budget and a similar Numbe in 2024.,28,,
62,0.97,1912.443,1914.045,And the forecast dropped a total of?,29,,
63,0.97,1914.045,1926.824,"By about 25%, so over the three years, 2022, 2023, 2024, 64 million.",30,,
64,0.97,1926.824,1927.492,Thank you.,31,,
65,0.97,1927.492,2005.47,"Yeah . No problem . so as a reminder, we fund capital projects, capital parks, libraries, and we are going to show a slide that shows how th balancing package addresses Thi in a moment . before we do, I want to note there are significant decreases in the suite and beverage tax and commercial parking tax . So when we use the number of a decrease in over $80 million in revenue over the biennium, it is a Tota for each of these funds . great so the next slide is a Snapshot of the compilation of all the changes to the proposed budge in the balancing package . You will see the numbers in 23 and 24 were there are ads and reductions by each of the category areas . I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this slide here, because we will Tal line item by line item about each of the changes . We will add more to the presentation if it is helpful . the next slide, I believe, is Jumpstart . great.",32,,
66,0.97,2005.47,2105.436,"So this is a summary of a balancing package released today . We look at the 2023 LIN at the bottom . The total number shows there is a $320 million Jumpstart resource in the budget . This was a combination of revenues projected from 2023 and carried forward at higher than anticipated revenues in 2022. of the 320 million, 100 million is used to balance the general Fund and address the operating deficit . The rest is invested per category per Jumpstart policy . You can see O the right, 62% in affordable housing, 9% each in the green new deal and development initiative, 15% for revitalization, and 5% into administration . I will note that the package makes several swaps between Jumpstart and general fund to address issues and expenditures that did not align with the Jumpstart define categories . and it allows in this biennium certain numbers that are not fully aligned with categories to use Jumpstart as funding . for example, the Jumpstart fund is used to Backfill revenues from the suit and beverage tax . Overall, the proposed package meets spending consistent with the original category while supporting the general fund to avoid Reductio all key programs.",32,,
67,0.97,2105.436,2112.343,"Okay, great . Let's pause for a second . Council member Louis?",33,,
68,0.97,2112.343,2112.677,,33,,
69,0.97,2112.677,2146.511,"Thank you, Madam chair . Mayb this is a question for Madam chair . Esther, I recall discussions in the spring that it was possible that the administration number on our original Jumpstart spend plan might be higher than our anticipated ongoing administration needs to administer the spend plan at 5% is that not something that has come to fruition? I see the 5% reflected in this chart.",34,,
70,0.97,2157.054,2157.622,Go ahead.,35,,
71,0.97,2157.622,2219.317,"Thank you . good afternoon, Council members . for the record I am Allie Canoochee of central staff . I would say the proposed budget actually proposed to use less than 5% of the Jumpstart administration fund for administering the tax . The only reason it even reached 5% in th proposal in the balancing package is because just for Thi biennium, the chair has allocated some funds that Woul have been part of the 5% to support expenditures that are not aligned with the Jumpstart spending plans such as adding $million in both 2023 and 2024 t increase mental health support for schools . and so, I think what we are seeing so far is that it will not require the 5 to administer the Jumpstart Fund . I just want to know that the executive departments are still figuring out how to stand up all of the new programs and services funded by this major revenue source and I don't expect that number two decline significantly over time . But so far, it has not surpassed 5%.",36,,
72,0.97,2222.286,2381.612,"And as a reminder as well, I was up to 5% for administrative costs . We also went through Tha and tried to similar to other policy categories aligned to se if there was a direct nexus to Jumpstart administration, and was being proposed . We were Abl to identify some areas that did not have a direct tie to Jumpstart and have offered, in most cases, to fund those through a different revenue source . again, as I mentioned a the beginning of the meeting here, following Council President's remarks about the school, students, demands for responding to the shooting at Ingram high school, we did work within the last 24 and 48 hours . It seems like it's all Runnin together at this point . We worked over the weekend to try to make sure that the final budget reflected higher investments, especially into mental health support for the School-Based health clinics . So recognizing that we had additional room, if you will, from some of the reductions that are taken from the administrative category only from Jumpstart, that is where I offered some additional flexibility for investments INT bringing the total investment for mental health services and schools to 1.5 million each year, that is over the biennium . We also, as you will hear, used some of the portion for reinvesting in food security and food access Becaus of the reduction that those programs would have taken due t the sugary sweet and beverage tax reduction and revenue hit I the revenue forecast . and finally, as well, we used about half 1 million for Eviction prevention strategies, recognizing these three areas, food assistance, mental health for kids in schools, I believe within the administrative category if there is Unprogrammed funding because administrative costs were not fully up to 5%, the broad coalition of folks that have supported the temporary use of Jumpstart to help prevent against austerity, just like we have in the first two years, investing in these court categories for our most vulnerable is something that Aligns with how we are Investin in using Jumpstart funding in this two-year period . all of those programs as well are not intended to be ongoing . We wanted to make sure we made initial Investmens where there was available revenue and I--made the decision to free up th Admin estate of category for those three investments specifically--so we will talk more about that when we talk about jump start as well but those are three examples!",37,,

74,0.97,2382.146,2476.74,"Thank you . I recognize we AR probably going to talk more about Jumpstart, but I wanted t take this opportunity to thank you, Madam chair . We have had some discussions in August Abou how we should look at our Jumpstart policies, the existing codified spend plan versus the strategy that we used last year during budget process to avoid austerity funding, maintain core city services, addressing Increasin economic uncertainty, and increasing needs in the community, and I just wanted to say here, now, this is a good demonstration of the Flexibilit that you brought to this conversation while recognizing that we do want to still maintain our investments in Jumpstart according to the Spen plan . something needed to give with the additional funds Abov and beyond that spend plan allocation . So I just really Ãšwant to thank you for this conversation while still sticking to the values, and th policies that are part of the passage of Jumpstart, and the huge coalition . You are so Goo to always remind us of this hug coalition of folks who guided us in those discussions.",38,,
75,0.97,2476.74,2482.813,"Thank you very much, Vice-Chair . and I want to thank you as well for being a thought partner on how to address this early on in our August meeting.",39,,
76,0.97,2482.813,2523.42,"We did tee up the possibility O using higher than anticipated revenue to stem any program reductions to prevent austerity prevent cuts, and appreciate th colleagues gave us some opportunity to begin dialogue with CD Oh with what that should look like . Obviously, there are some areas where we are trying to basically Realign with what the initial offer was and still offer the flexibility so that's what we have done her and the chair mentioned the Sign-On letter that has been circulating . again, I just want to confirm it since it has been pulled up and Referenced here.",39,,
77,0.97,2523.42,2537.468,"In August, this letter was circulated . in part, given that Jumpstart is rejected to raise revenue, was estimated in 2020, we support the request made by Councilmember Mosqueda--2023 and 2024 with access jump start revenue only to continue equitable core city services.",39,,
78,0.97,2537.468,2619.683,"They go on to say that they recognize higher than anticipated returns, using the higher than anticipated return is only a short-term measure an we must continue to support ongoing progressive revenues an make it true in outgoing years not only to the spend Categorie that we have helped to protect in this budget but holding back the full amount as well so thanks again to 350 Seattle, civic ventures, downtown emergency service center, downtown--excuse me, housing consortium of Seattle County, low income housing Institute, inaudible] the coalition on homelessness, 775, nine 1199, statewide property action network, solid ground, 117, UAW 4121, [inaudible] Washington state, policy center, [inaudible] and working Washington, just as a reminder of the folks who, at the organizations in the community that was really helping to hel us stay true to the categories of the spend plan but also signaling support for using the higher than anticipated revenue and the example that I Mentione where there was Unprogrammed administrative costs not takin from any of the other Categorie but especially in the needed administrative cost applying that to preventing austerity and hardship--thank you for raising that again--let's Tur it back over to the director!",39,,
79,0.97,2619.683,2666.063,"The last thing I will say on this slide is, the budget does the bouncing package does Retai a $15 million Jumpstart Reserve that is held for a fluctuation in future forecasts . the next slide breaks down other resources that were used to fund the programs in this package . So, there is $7 million in reductions in changes assumed under spend from the year-end supplemental ordinance . There is about $8 million in sort of technical adjustments and fund swaps.",40,,
80,0.97,2666.063,2711.308,"There is $7 million in 2023 in 6 and 24 that is about limiting the expansion of new programs and realigning policy . again, W will see this in the CBA's that we move to next . a couple examples here is, it reduces NE proposed programs for community health workers and equity Actio plans . It scales back the action of affordable Seattle--a city program, and it retains investment there, but focuses O building out the technology and getting more programs on the platform in 2023 before a large community engagement effort.",40,,
81,0.97,2711.308,2794.625,"This section also includes 2 1/ million dollars in reduction to the Seattle police Department which we will break down in a few days . and then, we do see new and vacant positions, Abou $1 million there, many of these are internal . So we reduce the initiative to staff and the Department of human resources t the inner-city budget office, one is the service Commission, and three at Seattle public utilities for expanded Graffit cleanup, retaining the $2 million in existing staff in the base budget for that function . and then, finally, Yo know, the biggest number on Thi table is about a Revisit of reserve . The proposed budget included a $10 million a year contribution to the emergency fund which is being rebuilt Ove a five-year period .--post pandemic . The bouncing package contributes $1.5 million in 202 to the emergency Fund . that is suspending 8 1/2 million dollar of the contribution, and it fully SUSPENDS the $10 million contribution in 2024. we also use the $9 million from Cleanin reserves, at about $4 million over the biennium from Sdot emergency reserves . My next slide is about balancing.",40,,
82,0.97,2794.625,2868.365,"Counselors, we shared a memo this morning that spells this out in more detail, and our staff is, of course, happy to field questions about this . so as I mentioned, sorry, this--keep skipping this slide . Othe funds used to balance the general Fund, we talked about the Jumpstart Fund . Also, this package ACCEPTS the proposed changes to suspend the requirement that would direct a portion of your transportation network company tax revenues to affordable housing transit and modifies the short-term rental fund to support the developing initiative at $4.4 million, annually . great . Now we can go to this . so as we mentioned, a $64 million decrease in the forecast over the biennium, the first place that resources WER drawn from word reserves . So this package removes $15 million from the revenue stabilization Reserve . It retains $10 million in that Reserve per financial policy.",40,,
83,0.97,2868.365,2941.905,"Second, it looks at 2 major capital projects . The first is Memorial Stadium . The proposed budget included $20 million in cash financing for the Stadium and debt service to support another $20 million of debt financing . that is scaled-back in this package to be just $20 million of debt financing in 2023. the second capital project is the waterfront operations, interpretive center participation of the balking building on the waterfront . The proposed budget included $13 million of cash financing for the purpose--for the purchase of this building . The balancing package changes that to debt service . sorry, $13 million in debt, financing, and includes the debt service starting in 2023. after those major projects, there was a swath of funding for other resources.",40,,
84,0.97,2941.905,2956.086,"There is some swapping in the transportation Fund, and then more significant swap in the office of housing . Let's go to the next slide . in the office--sorry, a hand.",40,,

86,0.97,2963.794,2964.227,Absolutely.,42,,
87,0.97,2964.227,3013.543,"I will come back later on that Memorial Stadium issue . I have questions I can ask you off-line . so on the waterfront operations issue, when you have the sentence, reduce the 13 million, increased debt service provide 1 million in 2023, then you say approximately 1.3 million in 2024 and beyond, so does that mean, and beyond, is that the commitment level until you hit 13 million? I'm confused . I am sorry.",43,,
88,0.97,3013.543,3017.647,"Yeah, no problem . The proposed budget assumed we Spen $13 million in cash to purchase the building next year.",44,,
89,0.97,3017.647,3018.014,Okay.,45,,
90,0.97,3018.014,3039.436,"We took out the $13 million in cash and assumed that the city will issue debt to issue $13 million worth of debt . So what is in the budget is the debt service to pay back that $13 million of debt . that debt service in 2023 is 930,000. we assume it will be $1.3 million, essentially our debt payment in 2024, then it is built into the financial plan at that rate.",46,,
91,0.97,3039.436,3053.15,And those are the debt financing--that services that tax-exempt debt services that is backed by the city of Seattle? so those are major debt financing for government -,47,,
92,0.97,3053.15,3053.617,That's right.,48,,
93,0.97,3053.617,3081.211,"Okay, thank you . What I had done was I pulled from the big paper document the Memorial Stadium redevelopment, then the waterfront operations, so thank you for helping clarify the language for me on that on the financing piece because obviously the commitment is still there, that we can see the $64 million wave coming . So if I am not using the correct language, that's what it sounds like to me.",49,,
94,0.97,3081.211,3091.121,"That's correct . Thank you, Council President . I have two comments on this . I will come back to comments you made before . and I'm going to turn I to Allie quickly to provide additional context as well.",50,,
95,0.97,3091.121,3095.992,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",51,,
96,0.97,3095.992,3124.621,"I want to qualify, they wouldn' be tax-exempt bonds . It would be through the city's limited bond ordinance . So the package includes a number of changes both to add this debt service as well as modify the policies and amend the bond issues ordinance to support this.",51,,
97,0.97,3124.788,3128.158,"Thank you very much . Then as you noted, we will have more conversations about it overall.",52,,
98,0.97,3128.158,3226.489,"Specifically, these two projects, I wanted to take a quick 2ND to thank the Council president in another select budget committee meeting . You spoke to the importance of both of these . I want to thank you for your leadership on these efforts . When we saw $64 Millio rate hit in early November, these are the two largest investments that are using rate cash . and I want to thank the central staff team for all the work they have done because it is through their difficult tasks in the last three or four Days.This is Latebreaking information that we were able t build back into a budget Becaus we were able to figure out a Wa to build this balance . We want to make sure it is abundantly clear to our community partners, including Seattle public schools, for example, Union laborers who are working together for the next Iteratio of Memorial Stadium, that we have strong partners . So there should be no question when they see $20 million being set aside for debt financing for this project and the continuation of this and the CIP that the city is committed to Memorial Stadium . Similarly, we want to keep our commitment to the general public and especially the Muckleshoot tribe for the waterfront operations, 10,000 feet, we have committed to working with the tribe to Ensur they have the space they are, and we want to make sure that commitment and partnership is solid and strong . that's why both of these items are built into the budget . I want to repeat that . They are built INT the budget and they are using debt financing with the Preciou few dollars to ensure those commitments remain there and that our partnerships remain intact . Council President?",52,,
99,0.97,3226.489,3303.266,"Again, I don't want to Belabor the point, but I just want to give people the notion or at least get away from some narrative that the city of Seattle is backing away . As you know, these two projects are near and dear to my heart . But we listened to Seattle voters when they passed the education levy, and when the voters committed to saying we want Memorial Stadium to get Redone, and we want to be good partners this is a discussion that has been going on since 2016 that I have been part of . So I can Tel you, I am comfortable . I am positive that the commitment is there . We heard the voters with a partnership . I think we Shoul us a little bit off-line . If I can just take a moment, Madam chair, is that Memorial Stadium for the school district in partnership with the city of Seattle is also an economic engine that will generate revenue not only for the school district but for the city of Seattle, and it's only a Win-Wi situation . So thank you so much for Articulating that the commitment to intent is still there . We are not sure we are ready . We are moving forward . I look forward to working with my colleagues in the public school and the Mayor's office on this very important project, so than you.",53,,

101,0.97,3307.47,3436.633,"Great . Let's look at the Nex slide that shows by Department what these reductions look like a couple things I haven't yet named in housing, there is a swap of rate money in the office with mandatory housing Affordability dollars . The state divided limited flexibility to the city during the pandemic to use the rate fo affordable housing . The city used that flexibility in 2020, believe, to finance $25 million worth of projects backed by payments of $5 million a year for 5 years in this balancing package of the repayments in 2022, 2023, and 2024. they are switched with mandatory housing Affordability dollars . in both parks and transportation, there are reductions in line items I the capital improvement program which are Prioritized for area where there are not programs tied to the dollar . There was a sidewalk, a Playfield, somethin explicitly that had been promised to community in these line items and in all of these line items I believe there is funding in the base or in the future beyond what was reduced here . So in transportation, those reductions are in CIP lines of for bridge painting an sidewalk safety . In parks, they are in line items for asset preservation, A.D.A . compliance and field renovations, and a reduction to the contribution to the green Seattle partnership . The city has contributed to this public drive it partnership over the years . We had paused our education during the pandemic, and this delays the reinvestment in that partnership.",55,,

With Mha coming in well over projections over the next few years, over the next few years, and the projection that is going to continue to be robust, we are choosing to identify this source to help Pa back the commitment . If it recovers, we will be able to shift back to the $5 million a year using the rate . This is a key decision but also the opportunity for us to Revisit I we seek recovery . Even the higher than anticipated--I keep using that term . given th robust returns from Mha that we have seen over the last two years and the projection there will continue to be increase, that's why we are trying to figure out how to pay back this forward commitment that we had already made .

I am sure they would be happy to tell us what they would ballpark the kinds of projects they might have to delay . We have looked at this category . This is the major funding category for taking care of major maintenance and asset management with everything from the roof to clear innovations to doing bathroom renovations and then there is a bunch of things like asset management planning . There's a number of different categories that might be the first thing they look at in terms of reducing the funding .

I think you can't say for all of the categories irritating for the community center reduction I think they are in a pause or a moment of needing to advise and Revisit what kind of improvements they would be doing and that which community centers . that is that they do not have specific allocations.,68,,
136,0.97,4169.398,4181.21,The dependent on the category and we can certainly ask them on what they might intend with these opposed reductions to delay in terms of these projects and for some of these were just delaying the funding.,68,,
137,0.97,4181.21,4190.219,"That is what we are talking about . for others, it may be cut from projects or those like it pushed to a later date as well.",68,,
138,0.97,4190.219,4193.155,When we ask specifically in transportation . did you have anything else to add?,69,,
139,0.97,4193.155,4199.495,Do you want to address the sidewalk issue? it would be more precise in my response would be.,70,,
140,0.97,4199.495,4213.542,It might be confusing on this table because this is showing the net total of all of the Re-Transactions that are affecting the balancing package in transportation.,71,,
141,0.97,4213.542,4274.003,"That is why it is showing a positive number . The proposal does make targeted cuts to bridge painting and to the sidewalk safety program for the bridge painting program, I believe the reduction is $3.2 million in 2023. that would reduce the proposed $8.5 million for the program down to $5.3 million for 2023. for the sidewalk safety program, this would reduce the proposed budget at $7.4 million in 2023 and $9 million in 2024. this proposal would reduce it by $2 million in each are down to $5.4 million in 2023 and then $7 million in 2024. both of these cases, these are programs that have a number of small projects that are funded by these programs . I do not have a specific list as to which specific projects might be impacted.",71,,
142,0.97,4274.003,4306.068,"I want to add to that . The key word is, ""reduced ."" because you are not seeing this chart the funding that is still there . that is really important as well when it comes to A.D.A . compliance and play spaces . We did not pay the full amount of reduction that is there and we just try to take some haircuts in various places to make this balance.",72,,
143,0.97,4306.068,4360.889,"I wanted to add that in general and across the departments with some technical assistance from the executive . The goal was to try to look at how resources are currently allocated across departments . The number in parks for example if you take out the $13 million for the building it looks larger because they receive a larger portion of resources as well as, S .. Sdot . that is what ultimately, it looks like net positive number . Overall, these projects were included for reductions or delays to try to minimize the impact of project as much as possible.",73,,
144,0.97,4360.889,4382.311,"Sidewalks, for example it doesn't anticipate that it was significantly impact the work in 23 and 24. they also have noted on the bridge that there is a $2 million Federal grant for painting . that helps sort of pushed the local investment out into the future year.",73,,
145,0.97,4382.311,4398.627,They were trying to minimize impacts on projects that were sort of in the works right now . with a $64 million projected reduction over the biennium . There is going to be some impacts.,73,,
146,0.97,4398.627,4490.986,"You very much . before going to Councilmember Pedersen . We are looking at whether or not there were staffing already on board to complete the projects . I know that came up as an issue for maintenance upgrades and I would suggest make a follow-up on that there is not a central stuff that wants to comment on that right now . It was part of the analysis that we always looked at in terms of what projects were ready to go and had the staffing . We are going to move forward . This is part of why we asked for an extra week . This chart is informed with the city budgets office and the departments because absorbing a $4 million hit rate before releasing a budget as part of the analysis asking the Department where there is some opportunity for us either delay, reduce, reschedule, and again, I want to thank them for helping identify a series of possibilities so that we could make some really tough choices . all of them will continue to invest in some of these areas . We can add to this chart perhaps to show what the reduction was but also what is in the base and where the funding continues.",74,,

I wanted to address this transportation item here . Thank you for answering the question about when the numbers are showing is positive instead of negative . I am concerned that the budget goes in the wrong direction on bridge maintenance when we consider the four items that the city auditor highlighted as being necessary to maintain our bridges . This is one of them that prevents erosion and rest and things that impact the structure . It is one of the most efficient ways to preserve the exterior bridges . I want to signal that I will be trying to restore some money to strengthen our bridges for bridge safety . one of the benefits of these capital items is that they can be funded from any source of funds . They are typically one-time issues that we can address . Even though Reet went for that in the past, there are other sources of funds that hope to find to boost that as an amendment.",75,,

155,0.97,4651.313,4661.99,There was a generation of options . The departments did not make any recommendations with a city budget office.,79,,
156,0.97,4661.99,4697.359,"They helped us identify places in the capital improvement program in the base budget aware there may be less impacted than others and that it was central staff and budget chair needed to make choices from that menu . in that context, we did have some conversations that specific line items and the best of our ability looking where they had minimal impact . There has not been that kind of robust analysis about these that would normally happen in the development of the proposed budget or amendments.",79,,
157,0.97,4697.359,4705.701,"Definitely back and forth and definitely information from the departments, but not recommendations with a depth of analysis.",79,,

I was trying to reference the respect and appreciation for that several ranges of government . We did try to identify options and none of them are good options.",81,,
160,0.97,4743.405,4786.214,"There is no recommendation from a Department, but in the two to three day period, we were able to identify ways in which this could possibly be mitigated if there is puzzle pieces that is really all that was put out there . My effort here was to really not eliminating funding completely where we could spread the peanut butter and key programs and projects moving forward . We would want to do that . If there were items that were not specifically programmed and ready for going, that is where we try to take some reductions . that is the process . Lastly, they definitely helped . There has been recognition that they are not in a recommendation period, that is what the Mayor transmitted to us.",81,,

164,0.97,4802.33,4867.629,"This shows a brief touch on two other things that we discussed earlier . They are producing the reserves that are specifically for the second Jumpstart fund to avoid is reductions . as a reminder, these are largely health and equity programs with prenatal and free grant programs, and fresh books to help families with fresh food at farmers markets and community senior meals programs . and then the forecast reduction of 3 1/2 million dollars was addressed through a combination of Reet in general fund swaps to minimize the impact of that on Sdot is operations.",84,,
165,0.97,4867.629,5084.679,"The final couple of slides that I want to address budgets Sustainability . This is an issue that you want taken very seriously this year and over the last few years . The two charts that I show are about the general fund as a reminder, that is the $1.6 million fund where the city had the most flexibility in revenues as a part of our overall 7 1/2 billion dollar budget . on this chart, the blue line's projected expenditures, the Redline is projected revenue, this first fight is the executive proposed budget . You can see a projected, ongoing average operating gap in our $193 million . The balancing package is currently constructed . You will see the Sustainability issue is about $57 million worse than the proposed budget . increasing that average operating deficit to $250 million . This is due to a couple of factors . The first counselor about half of the increase Sustainability issue is straight to the revenue forecast . The forecast decreased general fund projected revenues and that means there is less each year for our budget . The councils action to proposed the package to rescind the heating oil PACs has impacted those revenues that were assumed in 2023 and out years . There is new, ongoing spending of about $24 million and suspending the emergency fund which were one-time investments in those emergency reserves . This last slide reminds us that there are couple of things . The temporary provisions included in the package that allowed the general fund budget over the biennium without significant reductions to critical programs and services . Those short-term strategies include suspending the repayment of emergency reserves and higher reliance on Jumpstart funds . giving it some more time to look for efficiencies in the city budget and think about how to size appropriations with our revenues . In addition, there is a statement of legislative intent in this package that asks the central staff in the city budget office to work together to update policies around budget development in this year's financial plan to make sure we are using the very best practices to budget and give the very best information for the Council and executive when they are making decisions about vacancies, about future inflationary costs, have all of these things . Finally, providing the temporary strategies and time for the revenue stabilization Workgroup to make recommendations on new, progressive revenues that the city can implement to make sure they keep pace with the expenditure bill . that is the end of our opening presentation . at the chairs direction, we will do a Walk-Through of each of the actions in this package.",85,,

260,0.97,7733.826,7857.115,"I need to use this as an opportunity to clarify because I think there is some misunderstanding about what is being invested . I first want to say thank you to the green new deal oversight board . The board, the partnership that we have had with them, the conversations we have had with members of the board over the last few weeks have--they have identified priorities and provided feedback on some of the Iterations of the budget concepts we were contemplating and because of their feedback and priorities, we have tried to Online investments in the Jumpstart green new deal funds to align with what the oversight board has specifically called for . a large portion of the amendments included here come directly from the green new deal oversight board recommendations . I have it printed right here . There is notes all over . It is within the oversight board's recommendation and it is from the feedback that we received from them, we have identified ways in which we can shift funding that was being proposed for investments that might have a green nexus, but did not align directly with the green new deal spend plan and priorities that were called for and pushed forward by the oversight board . I want to call out a few examples . The recommendations that came from the green new deal oversight board included adding a mere $4 million combined effort into the climate resilience Hub so that we could invest in hubs designed by and led by communities most impacted work that is Osc 00 6 am 001. about half 1 million of that goes to what Councilmember Morales Hyatt identified for the resilience Hub, designed by and led by communities most impacted and directly from the oversight board we heard instead of going with what the Mayor had proposed for 3.5 million for climate resilience Hub, please align the recommendations with what our report and our recommendations identified for resilient hubs.",124,,
261,0.97,7857.115,7872.965,We wear redirected the three point five to be in alignment with what the oversight board Hub priorities were working towards . We have added a total of 1.8 million to increase environmental justice Fund.,124,,
262,0.97,7872.965,8021.113,"That is Osc 008001 . again, some of the recommendations we received over the last few weeks was if there is any additional funding in the green new deal investments, we need additional funding to go to the environmental justice fund to Deprogram later that gives additional possibility to the oversight board and the folks Stewarding the justice fund to have greater flexibility, but that is in alignment with the Riverside board and what they wanted us to do . Additionally as you see we are adding $3.6 million to support indigenous lead Sustainability projects . over the biennium, Osc 0078, 001 identifies Unprogrammed funding to specifically support indigenous lead Sustainability projects as defined by the folks at the table, folks who are most impacted by harm caused by climate change and led by the indigenous community led projects and organizations . We were asked to put additional funding towards the investment so that more things like I am forgetting the name of the investment that was raised by one of the colleagues and partners of the green new deal oversight board, but they wanted to be able to pull from this funding for future projects that had I the indigenous lead Sustainability product, so we put a large portion of the funding towards that recommendation for future programming . This is per the green new deal Augmentation, the initial conversations we have had with them, the report they submitted earlier this year and the funds that are proposed here for climate resilience investments in parks and Seattle public libraries were shifted to to still create climate resilience helped, but to also follow the 2022 Hub study that would be implemented and led by the community identified resilience hubs . so to reiterate, we are not cutting resilience funding . We are shifting to green new deal oversight board recommendations, the community led climate resilience investments as directed from our conversations with the oversight board and as a reminder the green new deal oversight board is intended to help direct the green new deal Jumpstart funding . This is about Self-Direction, self determination and control and giving the oversight board the ability to help us redirect where some of the funding went.",124,,
263,0.97,8021.113,8050.709,They absolutely helped improve where some of the possible investments were going to go and we shifted to Realign with some of their initial feedback and thanks to that feedback I think the green new deal investments here better align with what we saw and heard from the green new deal oversight board . investments in the front line communities create greater climate resilience and facilitate a transition . I cannot underscore that enough.,124,,
264,0.97,8050.709,8106.865,"There is still investments in climate resilience funding . We have just shifted it to be more in line with what the board's recommendations were . I am happy to take additional questions and just to provide additional context to the example for the 3.6 million indigenous lead Sustainability projects, one of those is the lifting Springs project that was lifted up to us as one of the project and development from the green new deal oversight word members . I hope that offer some clarification on that and I look forward to talking more with folks who have a very similar goal in trying to make sure we are shifting more funding to green new deal investments, but I went to clarify there is not a reduction . We are trying to lift up where the adjustments were made to align with the recommendations . Okay . Let's continue.",124,,

295,0.97,9021.312,9167.491,"Thank you . data specific to the hr legal side . I wanted to add, pause for a second and say just a point of personal privilege to add some context to a few of these . feel free to add anything or correct anything . When we receive the budget, one of the questions I asked was what is necessary to implement the ordinance that the Council approved earlier this year regarding recruitment and retention . I wanted to make sure there was a budget that aligned the minimum requirements to make sure we could implement that into statute and if there was anything that was above and beyond, it may be nice to had to it was tied to the ordinance . I would like that to be part of what we were considering for possible haircuts just like we did with other areas throughout the budget that have been a challenging discussion . In order to make sure we were fully adhering to the hiring plan and retention plan as proposed by the Mayor in this budget also as passed by the Council earlier this year, I wanted to make sure we were not making reductions to those areas that could help fulfill the intent . that is why you are not seeing any proposed changes to the items like bonuses that would directly impact the ability to follow through on the implementation of the hiring recruitment plan . However when there was an item that appeared to be additive and beyond what is needed to directly implement that ordinance, we had to wait that with just like other areas in the budget to see if it was an immediate impact, things like a PR firm for contract or revamping a Website . We had to put those on balance with some of the other investment areas . again, not speaking to the value of those investments or not, but just trying to way where there is investments we could get back on given the budget the duration, but fully maintain the hiring and retention plan . again the SPD Department here does maintain in addition to the full hiring and recruitment and retention plan, they also maintain 120 Ftes in terms of positions within the Department that we are not proposing to touch.",144,,

So just wanted to flag and thank you as well, Madam chair for moving forward in this way as well as central stops analysis that led to I think what is a good decision here.",145,,

300,0.97,9268.826,9381.071,"Thank you . I appreciate all the hard work that you have done as chair here and your team and city council central staff on these items . Under the Mayor's office in the city budget office but a tremendous amount of thought and work into their original budget or puzzle and I am grateful for the efforts to restore some of the investments we talked about earlier, and same time, I went to address these public safety items here . I am concerned about the changes to the Mayor's original budget concerning public safety . What I am seeing is the Mayor's proposed additive investments, thanks for the context about the baseline, but I'm seeing the additive investments in graffiti abatement removed and the gunshot technology removed . feel like we are Revisiting the debate in 2020 and 2021 by deleting or aggregating any position pockets from the police Department, which personally I believe goes in the wrong direction and would require a super majority to restore those position pockets in the future . I see the proviso that takes away the police Department flexibility to use savings to address overtime needs despite the fact that they have a severe staffing shortage . I am seeing the police officer retention measure cut by 850,000 over a two-year period that is the leadership Academy . one of the big ticket items was the Mayor's proposal to return parking enforcement officers back to Std . I thought that was what the part enforcement officers wanted . I am seeing this rebalancing not to that.",147,,
301,0.97,9381.071,9415.472,"So I guess I have a question for central staff about how that works methodically because I thought there were some savings adherent in moving the parking enforcement officers, returning them to SPD . I thought there was at least $5 million . So I am wondering how that savings was found and if we were to move them to SPD, with that generate $5 million that we can then to deploy to some of the ads that did not make it into the package.",147,,
302,0.97,9415.472,9515.639,"Let me see if I can take a crack at that . First of all I want to talk about the term savings . It is not really savings . The Department of transportation charges overhead on their expenses and that overhead is allocated to all the sources that fund the transportation levy in the transportation Fund and so by keeping the PEO's in Sdot, there is a general fund requirement, General fund has to come in and fund the overhead costs for the videos in Sdot, and what that does is alleviate some stress from the other funds from the transportation Fund, from the levy . Now if the PEO's are moved back to SPD, what it will do is free up the general fund supporting the overhead and in the chairs package that is a $.3 million, but it is not savings per se . It would free up a .3 million in general Fund, but that same amount of overhead and SPD or in Sdot which is be reallocated to the other funds . So the eight point three with become available for the Council to use, but then the other funds, the transportation, the levy that support Sdot would have to pick that up, so it is not necessarily a savings and I look to my colleagues to add anything to that that might clarify.",148,,
303,0.97,9515.639,9534.791,"If I could add to Greg's explanation . their cost allocation, it is built.",149,,
304,0.97,9536.26,9569.893,"They collect their cost allocation off of the labor that individual employees, but they work on . If they work on a general fund it project, if they were, levy product, the levy carries that portion of overtime and it is all overhead all allocated by the hours were . So really it comes down to the fact that this 123 division is completely general fund supported and so it shifts a number of those costs onto the general fund if they are in Sdot.",149,,

I am not seeing the before the badge program in here, the training I do see one training program that is being reduced, but I want to confirm before the badge is not materially impacted by any of these cuts . The second one, I am just now reading the statement of legislative intent, which is SPD 304 about background services, and clearly it is designed to find out what efforts are being made to diversify the force and I just wanted to note the cut to the marketing line item I think could impact their ability to diversify the force because it is my understanding they were trying to get the word out an alternative communities that there are positions available.",151,,

The background proviso you Referenced actually is a little bit different . It is designed to make sure when SPD is conducting background checks on potential officers that they are looking at affiliations with organizations that might, that have history of domestic terrorism in particular . So if an officer of was, if a Soon-To-Be officer, future officer was engaging into stick terrorism defined by the Bia, with that flight is asking for is whether that background process would look for that information, if those questions would be asked.",152,,
