36,0.97,118.785,122.922,"Madame clerk, could you read agenda item four into the record.",18,,
37,0.97,122.922,127.494,"Agenda item four, Department of education and early learning.",19,,
38,0.97,127.494,136.803,"Thank you, Madame clerk, I want to welcome to the forum here, Brian Goodnighe and Allie from central staff.",20,,

42,0.97,147.013,151.284,"Okay, thank you very much Councilmember.",21,,
43,0.97,151.284,154.02,"Just for the record, Brian good night, council central staff.",21,,
44,0.97,154.02,167.867,"So as you indicated this issue Id session is related to the Department of education and early learning or, deal.",21,,
45,0.97,167.867,172.205,Deal's 2022 proposed budget is $123.3 million.,21,,
46,0.97,172.205,177.844,An increase of 18% relative to the 2021 adopted budget.,21,,
47,0.97,177.844,180.413,Attributed to a few significant additions.,21,,
48,0.97,180.413,186.986,Most of you heard about at the September 29th select budget committee meeting when deal provided its Department presentation.,21,,
49,0.97,186.986,198.698,"As a quick Recap, the first of the significant proposed additions is 6.7 million of Coronavirus local fiscal recovery to continue investing in a set of enhancements to the Seattle promise program.",21,,
50,0.97,198.698,205.071,I'll discuss that proposed addition in more detail in the issue identification section of the presentation.,21,,
51,0.97,205.071,216.683,The second significant increase is $4 million to continue funding for an equity and cultural education fund that originated from the equitable communities initiative task force recommendations.,21,,
52,0.97,216.683,219.586,A joint project between deal and the office of arts and culture.,21,,
53,0.97,219.586,223.356,There was a lot of discussion about the investments at this morning's session.,21,,
54,0.97,223.356,227.293,"I'll NOTE in August of this year, the Council provided 4 million to deal.",21,,
55,0.97,227.293,230.396,And 2 million to arts for this effort.,21,,
56,0.97,230.396,236.502,And the Department's intent to issue funding opportunity for 2021 allocation at the end of the first quarter next year.,21,,
57,0.97,236.502,244.177,The third notable increase in deal's proposed budget is 2.4 million for another round of child care stabilization grants.,21,,
58,0.97,244.177,250.25,"There have been two previous rounds of stabilization grants for licensed child care providers and family, friend, and neighbor Caregivers.",21,,
59,0.97,250.25,253.72,This is intended as a continuation of that type of support.,21,,
60,0.97,253.72,264.264,"And Assistly, the proposed budget includes 1.5 million of sweetened tax beverage funding to continue a program started in 2021 but was added last year as a one-time investment.",21,,
61,0.97,264.264,268.668,The sweetened beverage tax community advisory board recommended this program become permanent and ongoing.,21,,
62,0.97,268.668,270.47,And these funds are added for that purpose.,21,,
63,0.97,270.47,289.689,"And then the last thing that I'd like to mention while we're still on this slide is the 2022 budget continues to fund approximately 1.4 million of early learning personnel costs and $676,000 of parent child plus costs with fund balanced for the 2011 families in education levy.",21,,
64,0.97,289.689,295.061,The 2021 adopted budget made a similar Fund swap and these costs would be funded by the general fund.,21,,
65,0.97,295.061,303.202,And the city budget office indicated it intends to restore the expenses to the general fund in 2023.,21,,
66,0.97,303.202,328.027,"Now, during deal's Department presentation a couple weeks ago, Councilmembers requested additional information regarding the undesignated fund balance for the family's education preschool and promise or Fep levy for context, I thought it would be helpful to show what the Fep levy's plan says about undesignated fund balance.",21,,
67,0.97,328.027,338.705,The funds will be to supplement the Seattle preschool program with the goal of increasing preschool slots for three to four-year-old children.,21,,
68,0.97,338.705,345.978,Any other use will be reviewed and approved by the Council through the annual budget process or other legislation.,21,,
69,0.97,345.978,353.119,"Now by the end of 2021, deal estimates the levy will have an undesignated fund balance of 14.4 million.",21,,
70,0.97,353.119,368.668,This comes from significant pandemic related under spending in 2020 which accounts for 10 million of the total and deal projects the levy will under spend its budget for 2021 by 4 million.,21,,
71,0.97,368.668,371.871,The 2022 budget does not use any of these funds in 2022.,21,,
72,0.97,371.871,378.211,Deal's recommendation is to reserve these funds to address two areas that the Department sees as potential risks in future years.,21,,
73,0.97,378.211,379.946,Early learning and Seattle promise.,21,,
74,0.97,379.946,390.59,"Now, in light of a letter that the levy over sight committee sent to Council with the recommendation to set aside the 10 million that 2020 under spent as a reserve for future years.",21,,
75,0.97,390.59,394.293,Councilmembers asked for the information provided to the over sight committee.,21,,
76,0.97,394.293,398.531,In a presentation to the over sight Committee on August 26th.,21,,
77,0.97,398.531,405.304,"Deal described between 2023, and 2026, the projected funding gap for early learning is between 3 and 6 million.",21,,
78,0.97,405.304,409.108,Impacted by increasing provider costs.,21,,
79,0.97,409.108,412.812,Provider staff shortages and high growth for providers maintenance and operations.,21,,
80,0.97,412.812,415.548,They also sited declining tuition revenue at that time.,21,,
81,0.97,415.548,420.319,But they've since clarified their latest projections show the trend reversing.,21,,
82,0.97,420.319,435.401,"With respect to Seattle promise, the projected funding gap is between 8 to 12 million and the impact sited were increase enrollment, and federally funded equity program enhancements.",21,,
83,0.97,435.401,436.536,The issue identification section.,21,,
84,0.97,436.536,440.439,Now might be the right time to pause and see if there's any questions on the background.,21,,
85,0.97,440.439,442.975,"Thank you very much, Brian.",22,,
86,0.97,442.975,444.444,Very efficient presentation.,22,,
87,0.97,444.444,448.047,Council President Gonzales would you like to start with Excellents or questions from your per view?,22,,
88,0.97,448.047,456.756,I think we should go through the issue identification portion and I will have comments there.,23,,
89,0.97,456.756,461.227,But I think we should just go ahead and allow Brian to go through the issue identification.,23,,
90,0.97,461.227,461.627,Appreciate it.,24,,
91,0.97,461.627,462.829,Thank you very much.,24,,
92,0.97,462.829,463.963,"Please, go ahead, Brian.",24,,
93,0.97,463.963,466.499,"Okay, thank you very much.",25,,
94,0.97,466.499,470.47,So this issue identification section of the paper begins on page four of the memo.,25,,
95,0.97,470.47,472.471,In case anyone is looking at the memo.,25,,
96,0.97,472.471,474.974,And there's only one issue that's identified in the paper.,25,,
97,0.97,474.974,485.251,That relates to the proposed 6.7 million of Clipper funding to continue to invest in a set of enhancements to the Seattle promise program.,25,,
98,0.97,485.251,488.521,A 4 million allocation in June of this year part of Seattle rescue plan one.,25,,
99,0.97,488.521,493.059,And there are ten enhancements being pursued by deal with that funding.,25,,
100,0.97,493.059,501.801,"If you're interested in seeing a short description of the program Inhansments, they're provided in attachment one to the memorandum.",25,,
101,0.97,501.801,512.678,But this table which appears on page five of the memo shows the planned spending by enhancement for the full amount of funding.,25,,
102,0.97,512.678,517.85,The 6.7 million included in the proposed budget that would be spent across 2022 and 2023.,25,,
103,0.97,517.85,524.524,"As of late September, deal had approximately $500,000 of the initial Cliffer funding.",25,,
104,0.97,524.524,532.532,And the Department expects that the entire 4 Million-Dollars will be under contract with the Seattle colleges or other partners by the end of the year.,25,,
105,0.97,532.532,536.469,"Additionally, deal has started the process of filling two new positions to support the program.",25,,
106,0.97,536.469,548.581,Both of which were included in the 2021 mid year supplemental budget ordinance and the cost for approved positions shows up in the final row of this table under the programming staffing support item.,25,,
107,0.97,549.248,555.221,So of the ten program enhancements being pursued deal considers five to be limited term or pilot programs.,25,,
108,0.97,555.221,561.861,And five to be ongoing enhance .S lasting beyond 2023 and the depletion of the one-time Cliffer funds.,25,,
109,0.97,561.861,569.502,In response to questions raised at the previous meeting deal provided additional information with respect to the projected funding gaps for Seattle promise.,25,,
110,0.97,569.502,579.779,The table on this slide shows the five ongoing enhance .S enhancements.,25,,
111,0.97,579.779,585.718,Sustaining these enhancements would cost an additional 19.4 million between 2023 and 2026.,25,,
112,0.97,585.718,596.295,These projections assume some level of support from Seattle colleges which is still being negotiated but without the support the funding gap could be larger than shown in the table.,25,,
113,0.97,596.295,603.235,I want to note these projections could change significantly depending on student interest and individual student needs.,25,,
114,0.97,603.235,610.009,"For example, enrollment for the 2021-22 school year exceeded projected enrollment by 145 students.",25,,
115,0.97,610.009,621.487,And deal continues to expect that enrollment in the next couple years will exceed initial projections by between 250 and 350 students per year.,25,,
116,0.97,621.487,628.694,The fifth implementation and evaluation plan does contemplate the possibility that interest in Seattle promise might exceed projections.,25,,
117,0.97,628.694,629.929,I won't read the whole list to you.,25,,
118,0.97,629.929,637.436,But the plan provides priority for certain students such as those that are low income or first generation college attendees.,25,,
119,0.97,637.436,654.92,"The plan says deal and Seattle colleges will work together to collect and analyze student enrollment, persistence, and completion trends to better understand how funds are being utilized and they should use this analysis to reform and refine a student Prioritization mechanism.",25,,
120,0.97,654.92,666.499,"In addition to Sustainability, another way to evaluate the program enhancements is comparing them against the recommendations from the racial equity tool kit for Seattle promise released in December of 2020.",25,,
121,0.97,666.499,674.34,The members of the team analyzed 14 program elements and provided recommendations and priority groupings for each of Tellments.,25,,
122,0.97,674.34,683.816,"Of the 14 elements, the team ranked sixth as a high priority, two as a medium priority, and sixth as a low priority.",25,,
123,0.97,683.816,689.789,Three of the team's high priority items and two medium priority items.,25,,
124,0.97,689.789,701.267,"So the table on this slide which appears on page seven of the memo, attempts to show the enhance .S that the team evaluated directly or where they evaluated a closely related topic.",25,,
125,0.97,701.267,706.706,"In the first row, the enhanced support.",25,,
126,0.97,706.706,711.811,They continued monitoring for this element but stated designing staff support does not seem equitable.,25,,
127,0.97,711.811,714.447,Some students may have a need for support than others.,25,,
128,0.97,714.447,718.617,Seattle colleges should have some flexibility in moving staff to meet student needs.,25,,
129,0.97,718.617,722.021,The program Enhancement that deal is pursuing would do just that.,25,,
130,0.97,722.021,726.959,By providing additional funding to Seattle colleges to differentiate student supports.,25,,
131,0.97,726.959,729.562,Including more staff support or new support programs.,25,,
132,0.97,729.562,735.334,The Enhancement in the last row of table sustained increased enrollment is a little different.,25,,
133,0.97,735.334,740.606,The team evaluated how tuition support should be Prioritized if enrollment exceeds available funding.,25,,
134,0.97,740.606,750.516,The team acknowledged the guidance contained in the implementation and evaluation plan and indicated the decision may be based on application Reefed in a prior year.,25,,
135,0.97,750.516,753.085,Requirements would need to be set before applications were received.,25,,
136,0.97,753.085,759.258,"In this case, the team explored a closely related topic to the Enhancement being pursued by deal.",25,,
137,0.97,759.258,772.304,To ensure the promise program is accessible to all graduates of Seattle public schools but they didn't make a recommendation related to that Enhancement specifically.,25,,
138,0.97,772.304,777.943,They're all related to expanding Seattle promise eligibility to additional students.,25,,
139,0.97,777.943,786.886,"To opportunity youth, charter school students, to students who pass their general education development or Ged test.",25,,
140,0.97,786.886,789.688,"In terms of options, there are a few laid out in the memo.",25,,
141,0.97,789.688,794.927,These are of course by no means an exhaustive list.,25,,
142,0.97,794.927,802.368,Option a would be to Prioritize funding toward enhancements in recognition of the one-time funding source.,25,,
143,0.97,802.368,807.273,"Option B, Prioritize funding toward enhancements that have been evaluated.",25,,
144,0.97,807.273,811.343,Potentially extending the amount of time the efforts could be supported.,25,,
145,0.97,811.343,823.689,I want to note both of the options would need to address commitments deal made as well as progress being made to fill the two positions supporting the expanded program.,25,,
146,0.97,823.689,832.298,Deal has been planning for some of the proposed 2021 funds to support students all ready enrolled in the 2021-22 school year.,25,,
147,0.97,832.298,834.633,That should be a consideration as well.,25,,
148,0.97,834.633,840.639,"And then the last two options, option C would be to approve the Cliffer allocation.",25,,
149,0.97,840.639,852.952,But in recognition of the funding gap to request deal work on a legislative proposal that would Prioritize enrollment of the program consistent with the priorities established in the implementation and evaluation plan.,25,,
150,0.97,852.952,858.057,And Lastly is the no action option.,25,,
151,0.97,858.057,859.024,And that concludes my remarks.,25,,
152,0.97,859.024,861.961,"Thank you very much, Brian.",26,,
153,0.97,861.961,862.962,Council President Gonzales.,26,,
154,0.97,862.962,867.9,"Thank you, Madame chair, thanks, Brian, for the good work as always.",27,,
155,0.97,867.9,869.735,Very thorough.,27,,
156,0.97,869.735,871.804,Very efficient.,27,,
157,0.97,871.804,874.907,"Very succinct, really appreciate it.",27,,
158,0.97,874.907,880.212,"So colleagues, I'm still digging into these various options.",27,,
159,0.97,880.212,885.084,I will say that option C rises to the top for me.,27,,
160,0.97,885.084,887.453,Can we go back to the previous slide?,27,,
161,0.97,887.453,894.059,And then can you go back to the one before this one?,27,,
162,0.97,894.059,894.526,"Thanks, Patty.",27,,
163,0.97,894.526,898.964,"And, you know, with sort of the potential of exploring option B as well.",27,,
164,0.97,898.964,905.437,"But I do--I do, you know, sort of there's a lot of granular detail here.",27,,
165,0.97,905.437,921.287,"I want to share with colleagues and members of the New England public, that really ultimately what we need to solve for is the on growing increasing demand of our student population to access Seattle promise.",27,,
166,0.97,921.287,922.721,Which all of us support.,27,,
167,0.97,922.721,927.526,All of us have been fervent supporters of Seattle promise.,27,,
168,0.97,927.526,937.269,But we need to reconcile that demand with the fact that the Mayor's proposed budget has proposed enhancing Seattle promise with one-time dollars.,27,,
169,0.97,937.269,940.406,That's going to create some instability in our budget.,27,,
170,0.97,940.406,949.948,Which I've heard the chair say multiple times that she is working hard to stabilize our budget.,27,,
171,0.97,949.948,952.384,And to utilize one-time dollars for one-time purposes.,27,,
172,0.97,952.384,968.067,"And this is an example of where Cliffer dollars, which are one- time funding source are being dedicated to ongoing programming at the city that is going to result in a fiscal cliff eventually.",27,,
173,0.97,968.067,1025.424,"Brian has done a good job of identifying where those funding gaps are and so because of those funding gaps that are part of this proposal, you know, I think it's incumbent upon us in this budget process to identify a way in which we can continue to support the growth of Seattle promise, but be really honest and transparent about the fact that that is not sustainable without exploring some kind of student Prioritization or a permanent, ongoing funding source for Seattle promise that doesn't create the Delima of choosing between early learning and and Seattle promise investments.",27,,
174,0.97,1025.424,1032.865,And so that's part of the reason why I'm signaling my interest in pursuing option C.,27,,
175,0.97,1032.865,1056.755,But invite colleagues who might be interested in a different option or who are similarly interested in that option to certainly let me and my office know so that we can work together on finding the right balance and the right solution to move us forward on this particular issue.,27,,
176,0.97,1056.755,1060.459,"Thank you very much, Council President.",28,,
177,0.97,1060.459,1064.296,Colleagues are there any additional comments or other items that you'd like to flag?,28,,
178,0.97,1064.296,1069.268,Questions you may have about the presentation?,28,,
179,0.97,1069.268,1070.302,"Please go ahead, vice chair.",28,,
180,0.97,1070.302,1071.236,I'm sorry.,29,,
181,0.97,1071.236,1076.909,I'm going to apologize in advance.,29,,
182,0.97,1076.909,1090.722,"This is not my area of focus and my--you know, where some of my work touches.",29,,
183,0.97,1090.722,1121.753,"This work is my just--as a member of RPC and the work that we've done to develop the start for kids renewal and I know that in developing the best starts for kids levy, we've been really careful to make sure that we have access to the subsidy in all geographic areas, including Seattle.",29,,
184,0.97,1121.753,1132.831,Including areas that all ready have a levy program with the idea that it would be additive to our existing program.,29,,
185,0.97,1132.831,1138.737,In targeting funds to families most impacted by the lack of adequate child care.,29,,
186,0.97,1138.737,1149.748,And so I'm just--I'm a little uncertain what deals recommendations are.,29,,
187,0.97,1149.748,1155.954,As it relates to the needed future funding for the Seattle preschool program.,29,,
188,0.97,1155.954,1171.069,It sounds like they are sort of assuming that the best starts for kids levy will help fund a gap that exists--that will exist in our levy.,29,,
189,0.97,1171.069,1179.945,But I don't think that that's what is intended by the best starts for kids levy.,29,,
190,0.97,1179.945,1195.227,And it also seems like it is a little bit in conflict as it relates to how fund--undesignated balances are supposed to be spent.,29,,
191,0.97,1195.227,1201.4,And that it's intended to be spent to invest in early learning.,29,,
192,0.97,1201.4,1204.403,So I don't know if I have a question there.,29,,
193,0.97,1204.403,1216.615,But I guess if I were to try to boil that down to a question it would be what are deals recommendations to address future gaps in the Seattle preschool program?,29,,
194,0.97,1216.615,1232.998,"If I could add to that, vice chair, your question is similar to mine, if we can just elaborate a little bit more on what the levy over sight Committee's recommendation is in regards to the spending that Funders spend.",30,,
195,0.97,1232.998,1236.602,"Sure, I can try to take a chance here and jump in.",31,,
196,0.97,1236.602,1240.105,"So let me flip back, a couple slides here.",31,,
197,0.97,1240.105,1241.34,If I can do that.,31,,
198,0.97,1241.34,1242.374,Just a moment.,31,,
199,0.97,1243.342,1245.978,Let me go this way.,31,,
200,0.97,1248.247,1254.853,"So I'm not certain where the question is coming from, Councilmember Herbold about the best starts for kids levy.",31,,
201,0.97,1254.853,1262.361,"What deal was presenting to the levy over sight committee was that--we have this fund balance, there's unspent funding left over.",31,,
202,0.97,1262.361,1276.775,"Deal is advocating a recommending to the levy over sight committee that we should hold on to it and not spend it in the next fiscal year because they see due to higher provider costs, the program will need more funding to sustain itself.",31,,
203,0.97,1276.775,1279.678,That probably includes more that be just Seattle preschool program.,31,,
204,0.97,1279.678,1281.713,They grouped it as early learning.,31,,
205,0.97,1281.713,1284.75,It's possible it goes beyond just Seattle preschool program.,31,,
206,0.97,1284.75,1288.387,And so they've estimated that gap is 3 to 6 million.,31,,
207,0.97,1288.387,1306.004,"So deal, if I were to speak with them, I would think we would say of this 14.4 million, we should hold somewhere, you know, it's all a guess, but somewhere between 3 million to 6 million we should keep in the Bank so when costs in future years exceed our available funding, we have funds to cover it.",31,,
208,0.97,1306.004,1311.41,I'm not sure if that gets at your question.,31,,
209,0.97,1311.41,1318.817,There's not an expectation that best starts is going to back fill future gaps in early learning?,32,,
210,0.97,1318.817,1323.689,"I have never heard deal talk about best starts being back filling at all, Yeah.",33,,
211,0.97,1323.689,1328.46,"Okay, thank you, I think that's the answer to my question, thanks.",34,,
212,0.97,1328.46,1334.032,"Councilmember her bolt, best start for Seattle, we do participate to some level in that.",35,,
213,0.97,1334.032,1338.637,But it's not a back filling funding source.,35,,
214,0.97,1338.637,1341.339,"No, it's not intended to be.",36,,
215,0.97,1341.339,1353.752,I'm referring to the renewal that RPC recently approved and the conversations were that it was intended to be additive.,36,,
216,0.97,1353.752,1366.198,I just thought that I had heard or read somewhere that deal was projecting that in future years that best starts could back fill some early learning gaps.,36,,
217,0.97,1366.198,1374.139,"But I'm hearing you, Brian, loud and clear that that is not something that is being proposed.",36,,
218,0.97,1374.139,1380.178,"And Brian, if I can ask for you to follow up with deal on the out years.",37,,
219,0.97,1380.178,1382.981,Because what we see here is 2020.,37,,
220,0.97,1382.981,1388.987,And what we see here is 2020-2021.,37,,
221,0.97,1388.987,1392.19,Undesignated fund balance being recommended to be banked.,37,,
222,0.97,1392.19,1405.003,"But I don't--I don't think that the proposal is that this would be Unbanked for--for, you know, 2024 or 2025 for example.",37,,
223,0.97,1405.003,1412.711,And so if we can get some clarity around that that would be helpful.,37,,
224,0.97,1412.711,1413.979,I'm happy to follow up.,38,,
225,0.97,1413.979,1419.818,The period of time we're talking about is the current Fep levy which makes collections through 2025.,38,,
226,0.97,1419.818,1422.721,And it funds the 2025-2026 school year.,38,,
227,0.97,1422.721,1425.157,So I think the expectation of deal.,38,,
228,0.97,1425.157,1436.201,"Or at least what they're planning for Risk-Wise is to say let's keep this money now in 2022 that way in the remaining years of the levy, we'll be able to spend that down and fund services.",38,,
229,0.97,1436.201,1438.403,But I'm happy to follow up with deal.,38,,
230,0.97,1438.403,1454.219,"Yeah, I think what we're trying to get clarity on is when is deal intending to spend the banked fund balance?",39,,
231,0.97,1454.219,1481.58,"And then to Councilmember Herbold's question, do any of those plans--are any of those plans relying on an assumption that they will receive dollars from the--or some sort of financial support from the best starts levy renewal.",39,,
232,0.97,1482.214,1483.215,Got it.,40,,
233,0.97,1483.215,1487.185,Happy to ask those questions.,40,,
234,0.97,1488.92,1497.929,"And then can you talk a little bit more, Brian, about the levy over sight committee recommendations?",41,,
235,0.97,1500.031,1500.332,Sure.,42,,
236,0.97,1500.332,1502.267,I guess--I'll restate what I said.,42,,
237,0.97,1502.267,1503.602,And I'm happy to go further.,42,,
238,0.97,1503.602,1514.079,"In that August meeting, deal presented this information to the levy over sight committee and made a recommendation, at the time, they were talking about the 2020 money.",42,,
239,0.97,1514.079,1516.014,Just about $10 million.,42,,
240,0.97,1516.014,1517.883,The $4.4 million of 2021.,42,,
241,0.97,1517.883,1520.585,I asked deal that during our budget process.,42,,
242,0.97,1520.585,1523.822,So that information is kind of more late breaking than the 10 million.,42,,
243,0.97,1523.822,1535.033,So the deal had made the recommendation to the levy over sight committee that funds be held in reserve for future years the levy over sight committee did discuss them and took a positive vote and subsequently sent a letter.,42,,
244,0.97,1535.033,1543.141,I believe it came out on the 27th of September to the Council.,42,,
245,0.97,1543.642,1548.813,Thank you both very much for those questions.,43,,
246,0.97,1548.813,1551.483,"Colleagues, are there any other questions?",43,,
247,0.97,1551.483,1552.517,Please G ahead.,43,,
248,0.97,1552.517,1555.987,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,43,,
249,0.97,1555.987,1568.099,"Thanks, and I had expressed some interest, this is moving now to the school based investments that are funded by the Fep levy.",44,,
250,0.97,1568.099,1578.009,You had done some research for me on the levy of spending for mental health services.,44,,
251,0.97,1578.009,1590.221,And I am interested in making Minnesota mental health related investments across a bunch of different spending areas in the city.,44,,
252,0.97,1590.221,1595.794,And the School-Based health care centers is one such area.,44,,
253,0.97,1595.794,1605.27,There's also the local agreement the city has with the county to provide mental health services in community based health centers.,44,,
254,0.97,1605.27,1613.311,"You know, there are investments in domestic violence prevention.",44,,
255,0.97,1613.311,1613.812,And elder abuse.,44,,
256,0.97,1613.812,1623.388,"And so, I have those interests sort of across a bunch of different investment areas of the city.",44,,
257,0.97,1623.388,1636.401,And I'm interested in Tieing something together around a mental health initiative in the wake of the Covid-19 social isolation that folks have been experiencing and the impacts.,44,,
258,0.97,1636.401,1647.412,"And what you've informed me, Brian, is that there's about 7.1 million proposed for school based health centers for 2022.",44,,
259,0.97,1647.412,1679.611,"And what I think I hear you saying that, just like for the other items that we've all ready discussed, promise program and the Seattle preschool program, if we wanted to have a larger investment in mental health--in School- based mental health services, that we would need to bring that to the levy over sight Committee for their--for their input.",44,,
260,0.97,1679.611,1697.128,"And we would actually need to mend the I and E plan to remove--or--which I don't want to do Obviously, but we would have to bring it to the levy over sight Committee for their concurrent, is that correct?",44,,
261,0.97,1697.128,1697.695,That's correct.,45,,
262,0.97,1697.695,1698.863,I'll do the same thing.,45,,
263,0.97,1698.863,1699.998,I'll bring up the slide.,45,,
264,0.97,1699.998,1708.606,"So the way I understand the levy implementation and evaluation plan, so like you said, one, you could amend the plan to do something else.",45,,
265,0.97,1708.606,1710.175,Council always has that ability.,45,,
266,0.97,1710.175,1720.318,"The second way is it does say unless it's for preschool, the Seattle preschool program, it will go to the levy over sight Committee for recommendation and Council would approve it after that.",45,,
267,0.97,1720.318,1721.286,What you described is correct.,45,,
268,0.97,1721.286,1723.588,It would go to the levy over sight committee first.,45,,
269,0.97,1723.588,1728.727,"Thank you, Brian.",46,,
270,0.97,1729.928,1732.664,"And again, sorry, Madame chair, may I ask a question?",46,,
271,0.97,1732.664,1736.334,"Of course, please go ahead.",47,,
272,0.97,1736.334,1744.042,"Again, doing something like that would--okay.",47,,
273,0.97,1744.042,1752.317,Let me see if I can Cue this up in different way.,47,,
274,0.97,1752.317,1775.24,"So Brian, the other impact here is if you had gotten a recommendation to create this reserve, the Council could modify the amount of the reserve for example to fund other priorities that exist for 2022.",47,,
275,0.97,1775.24,1781.079,"So the deals proposal is reserving, what is it?",47,,
276,0.97,1781.079,1781.379,10Million?,47,,
277,0.97,1781.379,1781.98,Or the entire 14 million.,47,,
278,0.97,1781.98,1786.05,10 million is what the letter says.,48,,
279,0.97,1786.05,1789.387,But they would probably say to reserve the whole amount.,48,,
280,0.97,1789.387,1789.721,Right.,49,,
281,0.97,1789.721,1815.013,"So the issue is sort of how do we--in other words, I'm identifying that there might be sort of a Scalable Reserve option that could allow us to address some of the appropriate expenditures in the K through 12 investment space that Councilmember Herbold is identifying.",49,,
282,0.97,1815.013,1819.851,"But that would still, none the less, need to be considered by the levy over sight committee.",49,,
283,0.97,1819.851,1824.155,"That's my understanding, yes.",50,,
284,0.97,1825.423,1828.359,Great.,51,,
285,0.97,1830.128,1834.999,"Okay, colleagues, I'm not seeing any additional questions or comments at this point.",51,,
286,0.97,1834.999,1842.073,Any parting words on Department of education and early learning that folks would like to share with us?,51,,
287,0.97,1842.073,1850.548,"Please go ahead, Councilmember Morales.",51,,
288,0.97,1850.548,1856.154,"Okay, well, I do thank you, Brian, for presenting this, and for helping us understand.",52,,
289,0.97,1856.154,1864.662,"I did just want to signal a couple of--well, a few Provisos that we are--sorry, amendments.",52,,
290,0.97,1864.662,1865.697,I didn't sleep much last night.,52,,
291,0.97,1865.697,1868.933,I don't know about you guys.,52,,
292,0.97,1868.933,1870.668,That we are considering.,52,,
293,0.97,1870.668,1872.67,Two will be very familiar.,52,,
294,0.97,1872.67,1877.275,Because we presented them last year.,52,,
295,0.97,1877.275,1883.781,One is around funding for culturally responsive programming for black girls and Trans-Youth.,52,,
296,0.97,1883.781,1892.657,We did just have this conservation with deal when they presented last week or the week before.,52,,
297,0.97,1892.657,1901.466,"So that included $550,000 to support a landscape study to understand how we can target investments for this group of young people.",52,,
298,0.97,1901.466,1904.769,"As we heard there was $395,000 left.",52,,
299,0.97,1904.769,1909.807,"So that funding, as I understand it s going to go out by the end of the year.",52,,
300,0.97,1909.807,1914.579,But we are interested in continuing that funding and possibly increasing it.,52,,
301,0.97,1914.579,1921.085,So we are looking into how we would be able to do that.,52,,
302,0.97,1921.085,1926.157,Another CBA we had from last year is funding for restorative justice in schools.,52,,
303,0.97,1926.157,1933.731,I understand that the Seattle school district just hired a new restorative justice coordinator to work at the district.,52,,
304,0.97,1933.731,1935.133,But that is one-time funding.,52,,
305,0.97,1935.133,1954.585,"And so I'm hoping we can figure out how to work, the city and the district, work together to really invest in these sort of Holistic systems level changes and in the way the culture of our schools operates.",52,,
306,0.97,1954.585,1967.565,So we're interested in again trying to renew this and possibly expand it there's also a request in the solidarity budget for this kind of funding.,52,,
307,0.97,1967.565,1986.851,And then a couple of things I think we all heard yesterday in public hearing from folks who are interested in supporting culturally responsive programming for middle and high school age young people.,52,,
308,0.97,1986.851,1997.929,"And programs that provide really important after school programming, academic enrichment, Language-Specific programming.",52,,
309,0.97,1997.929,1998.763,Not just for the young people.,52,,
310,0.97,1998.763,2002.9,"But they also provide family education, financial literacy.",52,,
311,0.97,2002.9,2007.138,Financial education for the families of these young people.,52,,
312,0.97,2007.138,2018.449,And so we are interested in making sure programs like that continue to get supported.,52,,
313,0.97,2018.449,2024.355,I think I'll stop there.,52,,
314,0.97,2025.556,2029.36,Thank you very much Councilmember Morales.,53,,
315,0.97,2029.36,2032.296,"Okay, Brian, I'm not seeing any additional hands.",54,,
316,0.97,2032.296,2036.868,I too want to thank you and all the members of the Department of education and early learning.,54,,
317,0.97,2036.868,2040.905,I did have the chance to see director Chappell out in community the other day.,54,,
318,0.97,2040.905,2042.84,And it was wonderful to see him and his family.,54,,
319,0.97,2042.84,2053.384,And I want to send our note of appreciation as the Council President did as well to all of the workers who are helping to provide educational opportunities from birth on through.,54,,
320,0.97,2053.384,2057.455,So thanks for all the work that you do especially in these tough times.,54,,
321,0.97,2057.455,2061.159,I look forward to these continued conversations.,54,,
322,0.97,2061.159,2066.597,"All right, Madame clerk, I think we're ready to read into the record item five.",54,,
323,0.97,2066.597,2070.435,Office of economic development for briefing and discussion.,55,,
324,0.97,2071.002,2073.471,"Excellent, thank you so much.",56,,
325,0.97,2073.471,2074.872,"Yolanda, it's wonderful to see you.",56,,
326,0.97,2074.872,2077.074,Thank you for joining us here today.,56,,
327,0.97,2077.074,2081.145,We will ask colleagues again to hold your questions until the end of the presentation.,56,,
328,0.97,2081.145,2100.598,"After we get through the first part of the presentation before we get to issue identification, Councilmember Morales, as chair of the committee that has per view over office of economic development will have you open up with some comments or questions and then we'll get into issue identification if you have any.",56,,
329,0.97,2100.598,2105.136,"Council central staff, Yolanda, please go ahead.",56,,
330,0.97,2105.136,2109.34,Thanks for joining us.,56,,
331,0.97,2111.042,2112.443,She's saying one second.,56,,
332,0.97,2113.611,2114.078,Sorry.,57,,
333,0.97,2114.078,2115.78,I couldn't find my mute button.,57,,
334,0.97,2115.78,2119.717,[Laughter]. It moved.,57,,
335,0.97,2119.717,2120.284,All right.,57,,
336,0.97,2120.284,2122.153,"Yolanda, council central staff.",57,,
337,0.97,2122.153,2125.89,So we are going to be discussing the office of economic development.,57,,
338,0.97,2125.89,2135.266,And I will be presenting a brief overview of their 2022 proposed budget before diving into a couple of key issues.,57,,
339,0.97,2135.266,2139.637,Just as a reminder.,57,,
340,0.97,2139.637,2141.873,We did present a couple weeks ago.,57,,
341,0.97,2141.873,2144.809,But I wanted to highlight their main lines of business.,57,,
342,0.97,2144.809,2147.812,Supporting small and may Crow businesses.,57,,
343,0.97,2147.812,2150.648,Partnering with neighborhood districts.,57,,
344,0.97,2150.648,2151.449,Supporting the creative economy.,57,,
345,0.97,2151.449,2158.856,"Partnering with key industry sectors that provide innovation growth, and global competitiveness and investing in the local workforce.",57,,
346,0.97,2158.856,2163.928,Focusing on youth and low income adults who are under or unemployed.,57,,
347,0.97,2163.928,2178.776,"An immediate response to the pandemic, they led the city's efforts to address the needs of small businesses by awarding emergency support grants of $10,000 through its small business stabilization Fund and distributed over $10 million in grants to date.",57,,
348,0.97,2178.776,2181.913,With the next application period for grants opening up next month.,57,,
349,0.97,2183.714,2197.728,"Oed provided and continues to provide a wide range of technical assistance to aid businesses, including support with renegotiating leases and converting to Online sales platforms.",57,,
350,0.97,2197.728,2223.221,"Recently, Oed Pivoted its efforts to begin supporting Seattle's economic recovery using its allocation of Federal Coronavirus local fiscal recovery or Cliffer funds as part of the Seattle rescue plan for additional small business stabilization fund grants, neighborhood recovery grants, downtown revitalization grants and investments in workforce development, Digital equity.",57,,
351,0.97,2223.221,2228.092,So on to the 2022 budget.,57,,
352,0.97,2228.092,2230.561,There it is.,57,,
353,0.97,2230.561,2234.398,So the total appropriations would more than double in 2022.,57,,
354,0.97,2234.398,2243.741,The changes reflect the removal of various one-time additions and restores full funding to the creative industry policy advisory position.,57,,
355,0.97,2243.741,2252.049,"Partially cut in the 2021 adopted budget and adds the standard cost and personnel adjustments, language Stipends for staff.",57,,
356,0.97,2252.049,2259.557,And removes all appropriations for the special events position added in the 2020 adopted budget so the position is fully supported by General Fund.,57,,
357,0.97,2259.557,2269.967,A large portion of the new spending would continue investments in programs recommended by the equitable communities initiative task force.,57,,
358,0.97,2269.967,2271.902,The Eci task force.,57,,
359,0.97,2271.902,2280.277,This 9.7 million of ongoing funding is supported by payroll expense tax revenues as was discussed earlier this morning.,57,,
360,0.97,2280.277,2289.787,And it primarily funds support for Bipoc owned businesses and programs intended to increase the number of Bipoc workers in the local health care industry.,57,,
361,0.97,2290.988,2301.966,"To support this body of work, Oed would also be adding position authority for four Ftes in the year end supplemental budget legislation.",57,,
362,0.97,2301.966,2315.579,"Additionally, to manage the short-term immediate influx of Federal funding Oed would be adding 13 temporary positions to assist with internal operations related to finances, grants and contracts.",57,,
363,0.97,2315.579,2329.16,"Others will support communications, performance, and data analysis and small businesses as they navigate the city's myriad forms of economic recovery resources.",57,,
364,0.97,2329.16,2331.662,Two other notable programmatic adds.,57,,
365,0.97,2331.662,2334.598,Inableed by Cliffer dollars.,57,,
366,0.97,2334.598,2336.734,7.6Million for a new small business ownership Fund.,57,,
367,0.97,2336.734,2344.141,That will allow small businesses to acquire ground floor commercial space in affordable housing developments.,57,,
368,0.97,2344.141,2349.547,Prioritizing those located in neighborhoods with the highest risk of displacement.,57,,
369,0.97,2349.547,2361.492,"500,000 for Maritime, manufacturing, and logistics workforce development following on the recommendations from the industrial and Maritime strategy Council which were released earlier this year.",57,,
370,0.97,2361.492,2368.532,"So with that, I'm done with my overview if anyone has any questions before I dive into issue Id, please let me know.",57,,
371,0.97,2368.532,2372.036,"Thank you very much, Yolanda.",58,,
372,0.97,2372.036,2375.94,"Councilmember Morales, do you have any comments or questions at this point that you'd like to share?",58,,
373,0.97,2375.94,2387.284,"Sure, thank you very much, Yolanda, I know Yolanda will be going over two specific issues that she wanted to cover.",59,,
374,0.97,2387.284,2393.657,I wanted to start by talking about a third that isn't really highlighted.,59,,
375,0.97,2393.657,2402.666,And so I first want to thank Yolanda for all the help she's given our office other the year.,59,,
376,0.97,2402.666,2410.841,"Especially as we're trying to understand some pretty big changes at Oed, policy changes and staffing changes.",59,,
377,0.97,2410.841,2418.149,And I do again want to acknowledge the work of the Oed staff.,59,,
378,0.97,2418.149,2431.829,They've really stepped up during the Covid response to move quickly as we said to offer support to small businesses and they really just deserve a lot of Kudos for the work they've done over the last year.,59,,
379,0.97,2431.829,2433.397,The last 18 months.,59,,
380,0.97,2433.397,2438.002,Our office has really been diving into workforce development.,59,,
381,0.97,2438.002,2448.746,So we've spoken with community members to really ask the question about what's the role of the city in an equitable economy and in workforce development.,59,,
382,0.97,2448.746,2455.219,So we've talked with Brian Sarat who is the former Oed director.,59,,
383,0.97,2455.219,2467.298,We've talked with consultant to the workforce development Council and former Edm one America rich.,59,,
384,0.97,2467.298,2475.773,"We've talked to Psrc consultant and Brookings Institute fellow Ryan Donahue, crest, South core, the people's economy lab.",59,,
385,0.97,2475.773,2483.781,We're trying to get a handle from lots of different perspectives on what workforce development could look like here.,59,,
386,0.97,2483.781,2494.124,"Three things we hear over and over again are that as a city, we're really not working as a regional partner on economic development and workforce development strategies.",59,,
387,0.97,2494.124,2502.166,"And so, you know, as an example here, we've got five different departments engaging in workforce development without a real cohesive Strateg.",59,,
388,0.97,2502.166,2504.768,And we're Duplicating regional efforts.,59,,
389,0.97,2504.768,2510.374,A second thing is that we're really ignoring valuable sectors of the economy.,59,,
390,0.97,2510.374,2516.046,"Our arts and creative industry is not just, you know, a mural here and there or a concert here and there.",59,,
391,0.97,2516.046,2522.119,It really is a key economic driver for the city.,59,,
392,0.97,2522.119,2531.829,And we want the creative industries and the film task force members to have their work--they've been doing a lot of work over the last couple years.,59,,
393,0.97,2531.829,2539.27,We want to honor that work and really deliberately consider the recommendations that they have proposed.,59,,
394,0.97,2539.27,2576.84,"And then the last thing is that the Department really lacks clarity and focus right now to sort of critically engage with regional partners on key economic strategies and the fact that there's been real inconsistency in staffing means we're left without any real alignment either internal or or with external partners, and it's created a sense of alienation among some of our key economic development partners and really led to a lack of confidence that Seattle has a cohesive equitable recovery strategy.",59,,
395,0.97,2576.84,2585.015,"And so--so I say all that because after Yolanda talks ability her issue areas, I'll address those specifically.",59,,
396,0.97,2585.015,2598.796,But the one thing I do want to share right now is that we will be working on a slide that assesses the landscape of the city's current workforce development investments.,59,,
397,0.97,2598.796,2605.636,And to really develop a better strategy that allows us to partner with our regional partners.,59,,
398,0.97,2605.636,2614.378,And create a real shared vision and agenda for what our city's workforce development efforts should be.,59,,
399,0.97,2614.378,2632.63,"I will say that an idea we've heard is that you know, in the next administration, maybe we actually have a cabinet level member who is really guiding the strategy and helping, once we have a clear strategy and plan, really guiding that process and working with regional partners.",59,,
400,0.97,2632.63,2634.999,So I'll stop there.,59,,
401,0.97,2634.999,2641.271,"Let Yolanda get to her issue areas, and I have a couple questions I'm happy to hear what my colleague Haves to say.",59,,
402,0.97,2642.373,2644.641,"Great, thank you very much.",60,,
403,0.97,2644.641,2650.547,"Thanks, Yolanda, go ahead with the issue identification.",60,,
404,0.97,2650.547,2651.348,Slide issues here.,61,,
405,0.97,2651.348,2654.585,Wrong slide.,61,,
406,0.97,2657.888,2660.858,There is another slide.,61,,
407,0.97,2661.291,2664.595,Sorry.,61,,
408,0.97,2673.404,2676.04,Here we are.,61,,
409,0.97,2676.04,2676.473,Okay.,61,,
410,0.97,2676.473,2677.741,Sorry about that.,61,,
411,0.97,2677.741,2687.584,So first issue is--this was touched on in the Oed's presentation regarding changes to film and special events permit fees.,61,,
412,0.97,2687.584,2693.891,Oed serves as the city's one- stop shop for applicants seeking special events permits.,61,,
413,0.97,2693.891,2707.671,"Coordinating permit application reviews with various departments including Seattle parks and recreation, Seattle fire Department, Department of finance and administrative services, Seattle public utilities, the Seattle police Department, and the Seattle Department of transportation.",61,,
414,0.97,2707.671,2714.645,"Until recently, city departments have covered the costs of their staff's time, engaged in this permit review.",61,,
415,0.97,2714.645,2732.162,"And also attending coordination meetings but Sdot, the Seattle Department of transportation has recently begun shifting its--to a cost recovery model for its Street use permits which includes those for film and special event INS are the public right of way.",61,,
416,0.97,2733.464,2744.641,"Currently, the city offers a low permit cost of about 25--of $25 a day for film shoots that use the right of way.",61,,
417,0.97,2744.641,2750.38,And this is one of the only incentives the city can offer industries.,61,,
418,0.97,2750.38,2755.018,Changes in practices could increase costs in special events starting in 2023.,61,,
419,0.97,2755.018,2759.523,Sdot agreed to continue covering these costs through 2022.,61,,
420,0.97,2759.523,2765.496,"Which are estimated to be somewhere in the area of $283,000.",61,,
421,0.97,2765.496,2767.965,The proposal would be finalized in 2022.,61,,
422,0.97,2767.965,2772.836,"And with Council approval, would take effect at the beginning of 2023.",61,,
423,0.97,2772.836,2783.514,"To help gather feedback from key Stakeholders, Oed's budget includes 50,000 to support outreach for racial equity tool kit analysis.",61,,
424,0.97,2783.514,2794.258,Not included in the budget was Oed's additional proposal to fund a consultant study of the economic impact of film and special events in the local economy.,61,,
425,0.97,2794.258,2797.895,These industries in the local economy.,61,,
426,0.97,2797.895,2819.349,"So while the outreach will help, while the racial equity tool kit related outreach will help Oed incorporate considerations into its forthcoming fee proposal the lack of a complimentary quantitative analysis may result in the city adopting a fee structure not fully informed by these industries respective economic contributions to Seattle's economy.",61,,
427,0.97,2819.349,2834.565,So the options would be to add funding in the budget to support an economic impact study of these industries or of course to take no action.,61,,
428,0.97,2834.565,2835.632,Any questions about that?,61,,
429,0.97,2835.632,2841.205,Questions or comments?,62,,
430,0.97,2841.205,2841.705,Councilmember Morales?,62,,
431,0.97,2841.705,2843.807,Any thoughts you'd like to share?,62,,
432,0.97,2843.807,2847.311,Thank you.,63,,
433,0.97,2847.311,2880.577,"Only that I think given the--what I've said it feels like over and over again about the need for us to be very mindful and honor the work that's been done, to try to support this industry, I do think it makes sense for us to choose option a here and provide the support to do a real analysis of how to best create a fee structure that best supports the industry here.",63,,
434,0.97,2880.577,2881.745,"Thank you, very much.",63,,
435,0.97,2881.745,2884.815,I'm not seeing additional hands on this one.,63,,
436,0.97,2885.816,2886.183,Okay.,64,,
437,0.97,2886.183,2890.053,I will go on to the next.,64,,
438,0.97,2890.053,2892.723,So I'm going to flip to the next slide here.,64,,
439,0.97,2892.723,2901.398,Because this is relating to the Oed's proposed organizational shifts and staffing changes.,64,,
440,0.97,2901.398,2908.205,"So just note that with this budget, Oed is proposing to make substantial changes.",64,,
441,0.97,2908.205,2912.809,Kind of in the Wanning days of the current Mayoral administration.,64,,
442,0.97,2912.809,2924.588,"While it's appropriately staffing up to support Covid relief and recovery, other changes are being proposed that may be better led by a new Mayor and or a permanent director.",64,,
443,0.97,2924.588,2927.324,"As--so this chart, there's a lot going on here.",64,,
444,0.97,2927.324,2943.974,So I will just note that the positions in green are the 13 temporary employees that I referred to in regards to the Department staffing up to kind of get the Federal funding and other funding out the door to community.,64,,
445,0.97,2943.974,2950.647,The four new positions to support the equitable communities initiative task force recommendations are highlighted in yellow.,64,,
446,0.97,2950.647,2962.726,"So for the purposes of this issue identification, we are going to be focusing on the positions that are highlighted in purple and kind of shaded as well.",64,,
447,0.97,2962.726,2966.363,So those are--so you'll NOTE some of them are shaded.,64,,
448,0.97,2966.363,2969.232,Some of them have a stripe through.,64,,
449,0.97,2969.232,2972.069,So beginning with the deputy director.,64,,
450,0.97,2972.069,2984.181,So they are proposing to reclassify this position from a manager 3 to an executive 2. I would note that Oed has not had this position filled for a couple years.,64,,
451,0.97,2984.181,2988.185,So it's recently moved to fill that position.,64,,
452,0.97,2988.185,2992.422,The next position that's being impacted hear is the creative history director.,64,,
453,0.97,2992.422,3007.504,This would be reclassified from a strategic adviser three to an executive one and be Repurposed to serve as the division director that would report to the deputy director and oversee main lines of business.,64,,
454,0.97,3007.504,3011.808,Next position that is impacted is the creative industry policy adviser.,64,,
455,0.97,3011.808,3018.048,This would be reclassified from a strategic adviser two to a manager two.,64,,
456,0.97,3018.048,3021.318,And titled to creative industry manager.,64,,
457,0.97,3021.318,3026.79,"Whose responsibilities will include policy development, implementation, and management of the creative industry's team.",64,,
458,0.97,3026.79,3027.958,Which includes five FTE.,64,,
459,0.97,3027.958,3040.637,"And finally, there is a youth employment development adviser, they're Repurposing this vacant position for a small business advocate who had been under filling the deputy director position.",64,,
460,0.97,3040.637,3048.812,So the shifts here would reduce Oed's dedicated workforce development staff from 2 to 1.,64,,
461,0.97,3048.812,3060.524,The Oed's explanation is that the youth employment development adviser position is no longer needed in Oed as the city consolidated this work and the human services Department.,64,,
462,0.97,3060.524,3063.527,And jointly with parks I believe.,64,,
463,0.97,3063.527,3082.079,"The diminished workforce development capacity in Oed would to Councilmember Morales' point she raised prior to me diving into this, will limit its ability to coordinate with regional workforce development Everetts and other related interests that may be of interest to the Council.",64,,
464,0.97,3082.079,3087.784,"Also, I would note that these moves also impact staffing for the creative industries.",64,,
465,0.97,3087.784,3105.368,"A brief history of these positions for context, in the 2020 adopted budget, the position that used to serve as the office of film and music director was Repurposed to serve as the creative industry director.",64,,
466,0.97,3105.368,3112.576,All other positions Socialed with office of film and music were implemented to into the creative key industry sector team.,64,,
467,0.97,3112.576,3117.848,And Oed Adam Hodges: creative industry policy adviser position to this team.,64,,
468,0.97,3117.848,3127.357,"Ofm was never official RI established as a separate office, it did operate within Oed with some degree of autonomy.",64,,
469,0.97,3127.357,3139.669,"After staff removed into the larger organizations that support the cluster strategy, Oed maintained that Ofm still had some presence within the city.",64,,
470,0.97,3139.669,3146.877,But as of the committee meeting a couple weeks ago indicated that will no longer be the approach moving forward.,64,,
471,0.97,3146.877,3158.889,So just noting that Repurposing the creative industry director to serve as a division director will diminish the number of city staff dedicated to the creative industry sector.,64,,
472,0.97,3158.889,3167.697,"Additionally, Oed is in the process of reassessing its creative industry strategy under the direction of new leadership in light of the impacts of the pandemic.",64,,
473,0.97,3167.697,3177.44,"All told, these moves could result in impacts to how Oed serves the larger community and industries it seeks to support.",64,,
474,0.97,3177.44,3194.291,"You know, Oed may need additional resources in the future to provide support for creative industries and workforce development but this may be a decision that's better made early next year in coordination with a new Mayor and their led director.",64,,
475,0.97,3194.291,3198.094,"So now, I actually want to go back.",64,,
476,0.97,3198.094,3198.662,Here we go.,64,,
477,0.97,3198.662,3214.744,So here are the options regarding the issue potentially considering a proposing proviso on the position of the division director creative industry manager pending the appointment of a permanent Oed director.,64,,
478,0.97,3214.744,3221.518,Cutting funding for either of these positions to delay their hire until earlier next year.,64,,
479,0.97,3221.518,3224.921,After the new administration has settled in.,64,,
480,0.97,3224.921,3225.989,Or no action.,64,,
481,0.97,3225.989,3230.06,Also options a and B are not mutually exclusive.,64,,
482,0.97,3230.06,3232.562,So it could be combined in some way.,64,,
483,0.97,3234.231,3236.666,"And with that, I'll open it up for questions.",64,,
484,0.97,3237.767,3242.639,"Thank you very much Councilmember Morales, please go ahead.",65,,
485,0.97,3242.639,3243.206,Thank you.,66,,
486,0.97,3243.206,3247.544,I think this reorganization is what I'm struggling with the most.,66,,
487,0.97,3247.544,3253.95,Just trying to get a sense of where things are going.,66,,
488,0.97,3253.95,3263.693,"You know, I know we have, as we've been talking about all day, you know, there's new staffing being proposed, new programs being created.",66,,
489,0.97,3263.693,3265.895,New contracts being signed.,66,,
490,0.97,3265.895,3268.999,All before we've passed a budget for any of this.,66,,
491,0.97,3268.999,3279.342,And so I really worry that we are setting ourselves up for the cliff that we keep talking about.,66,,
492,0.97,3279.342,3281.878,If funding changes.,66,,
493,0.97,3281.878,3294.224,"With regard to this Reorg in particular, I have a couple questions, Yolanda, can you tell me if it's normal to have three layers of executive management in departments?",66,,
494,0.97,3294.224,3307.837,"Because this--if I'm understanding this right, there's an executive director with a deputy director and a division director before we get to management of the different teams.",66,,
495,0.97,3307.837,3308.138,Is that --,66,,
496,0.97,3308.138,3314.811,"You know, I kind of looked at other offices and departments that were similarly sized.",67,,
497,0.97,3314.811,3316.713,Everyone kind of does something differently.,67,,
498,0.97,3316.713,3325.221,"And I think, you know, each Department would have an arm and Oed has an argument for why they feel this is necessary.",67,,
499,0.97,3325.221,3335.265,"You know, I can't say what their internal--it does seem like, you know, a number of directors for such a relatively small office.",67,,
500,0.97,3335.265,3340.837,Typically you'd see more kind of this division in maybe a larger Department.,67,,
501,0.97,3340.837,3346.743,"But you know, the leadership has determined this is what is needed for their operations.",67,,
502,0.97,3346.743,3355.518,So what's the difference between an executive classification and a management classification?,68,,
503,0.97,3355.518,3359.689,I'm not as familiar with our human resources terms.,69,,
504,0.97,3359.689,3371.534,"But in my mind, an executive is like more like closer to, your know, the executive classification is a director level classification.",69,,
505,0.97,3371.534,3371.768,Right?,69,,
506,0.97,3371.768,3384.781,"So a major kind of leadership, you know, big, you know picture thinking, leadership, those types of things I associate with that executive level classification.",69,,
507,0.97,3384.781,3388.184,"Councilmember Morales, I can just add a little to that.",70,,
508,0.97,3388.184,3392.789,To that description in terms of like the classification of positions.,70,,
509,0.97,3392.789,3395.225,Having recently gone through it myself.,70,,
510,0.97,3395.225,3402.665,The human resources Department looks carefully at the specific duties in sort of determining where to fit that.,70,,
511,0.97,3402.665,3411.775,"For this reclassification to go forward, it would have to be a determination that the sort of responsibility of this positions has risen to the level of an executive.",70,,
512,0.97,3411.775,3416.713,And it's not like a bright line of it's either this or that.,70,,
513,0.97,3416.713,3435.832,"There's some nuance as it varies by Department and I would just NOTE here in this particular position in previous budgets, it was several years ago when I was the analyst assigned to the office of economic development, the Council chose to apply for the position.",70,,
514,0.97,3435.832,3441.204,"Because at the time, there was lack of clarity about the need and all of that.",70,,
515,0.97,3441.204,3455.785,So I think this is getting at the issue that Yolanda is raising for all of you to consider of who there is a need for these positions and the reclassification at this time?,70,,
516,0.97,3455.785,3460.857,And is it right for a decision as we're about to have a new administration?,70,,
517,0.97,3460.857,3463.326,And then it will just also clarify with some of the options.,70,,
518,0.97,3463.326,3465.495,We'll have to look at the specific details.,70,,
519,0.97,3465.495,3467.997,Some of these positions may have people in them.,70,,
520,0.97,3467.997,3475.472,So the restriction may be on limiting the reclassification or filling all of their vacancies this year.,70,,
521,0.97,3475.472,3482.345,"Even though there may be a deputy that, you know, at the manager of three level or something.",70,,
522,0.97,3482.345,3482.812,Something like that.,70,,
523,0.97,3482.812,3489.986,So we'll be Conning to sort through those details should a Councilmember choose to pursue some of these Mayor pro Tempores.,70,,
524,0.97,3490.22,3491.788,Okay.,71,,
525,0.97,3491.788,3493.489,Thank you.,71,,
526,0.97,3495.225,3497.393,I have questions about the health care.,71,,
527,0.97,3497.393,3502.065,But I'm not sure that this is the appropriate place for them.,71,,
528,0.97,3502.065,3506.569,"Maybe I will ask--well, maybe I'll just ask.",71,,
529,0.97,3506.569,3520.25,One of the things I'm concerned about in addition to the fact that we have regional partners who are doing health care related workforce development is that very often the jobs that are open are not necessarily living wage jobs.,71,,
530,0.97,3520.25,3534.931,And so I just want to be mindful that we aren't targeting public resources to an end of the health care Inindustry and sector that doesn't provide family wage jobs.,71,,
531,0.97,3534.931,3541.838,Do we have any idea what specifically these positions might be targeting?,71,,
532,0.97,3541.838,3547.076,I would have to ask the Department for more detail on that.,72,,
533,0.97,3547.076,3548.878,But I'm happy to follow up.,72,,
534,0.97,3548.878,3549.379,Okay.,73,,
535,0.97,3549.379,3554.951,"Chair, if I can just indicate two things around the Provisos.",74,,
536,0.97,3554.951,3555.218,Sure.,75,,
537,0.97,3555.218,3558.221,And then we'll go to Councilmember Herbold.,75,,
538,0.97,3558.221,3558.488,Sure.,76,,
539,0.97,3558.488,3563.826,So I appreciate the work that Yolanda's doing here to try to help us understand what's going on.,76,,
540,0.97,3563.826,3582.278,I do think that it would be important to put a proviso on the creative industries and division director position until we have a better sense of what strategies are for how we implement the recommendations that the industry has all ready provided.,76,,
541,0.97,3582.278,3599.095,"And then, as it relates to the new line of business around the small business ownership Fund, I think it's really important that we align our Anti-Racist work in the city with the community wealth building strategies that we've been talking about.",76,,
542,0.97,3599.095,3609.772,"And I think that, you know, the idea of creating an acquisition fund for small business ownership is a really important idea that I support.",76,,
543,0.97,3609.772,3643.039,"But that sort of work is why Edi was created to help finance the construction and create space for ground floor businesses, community centers, cultural space, and so I would be interested in shifting the funding for that and that program over to Edi who has a strong relationship with office of housing, who knows how to do that sort of granting and programming all ready.",76,,
544,0.97,3643.039,3647.844,And I just want to signal that that's something that we will also be looking at.,76,,
545,0.97,3647.844,3648.678,"Thank you, everybody.",76,,
546,0.97,3648.678,3652.782,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",77,,
547,0.97,3652.782,3654.384,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",77,,
548,0.97,3654.384,3667.063,"Thanks, going back to the conversation around the creative industry.",78,,
549,0.97,3667.063,3667.73,Proposed Reorg.,78,,
550,0.97,3667.73,3698.695,"I wanted to--for purposes of historical awareness in the Q & amp; a on the budget questions about this, the executive points to the fact that the past, the former office of film and music director has been seen as an independent director of a stand alone office that reports to the Mayor although the creative industry's team formerly known as the office of film and music has been part of the office of economic development.",78,,
551,0.97,3698.695,3701.164,Where as that's accurate.,78,,
552,0.97,3701.164,3709.005,The history behind that is that there was a Mayor's office of film and music.,78,,
553,0.97,3709.005,3715.378,So there has been over the years sort of this subordination of this role.,78,,
554,0.97,3715.378,3723.853,And I am concerned that we are further doing so with this proposed Re-Org.,78,,
555,0.97,3725.154,3752.281,I guess a question that I would is a concern that thinking the creative industry's director from a level three policy director to a level two staff manager means there would no longer be leadership to develop policies that support these industries that are important to our economy.,78,,
556,0.97,3752.281,3756.252,Do you agree with that concern?,78,,
557,0.97,3756.252,3774.704,That a manager's role would be primarily to oversee the work of the creative industry workers and their efforts as opposed to more of a policy development role?,78,,
558,0.97,3774.704,3777.94,I think that's a pretty accurate description.,79,,
559,0.97,3777.94,3788.017,"You know, as you can see from this org chart, the division director is essentially seeing all those main lines of business that I described earlier in my Intro.",79,,
560,0.97,3788.017,3804.2,"So while they may be able to kind of dive in a little bit on some, you know, strategic direction, they will have many asks of their time verses having that dedicated space to be concentrating on the creative industries.",79,,
561,0.97,3804.2,3823.719,"And so that creative industry policy adviser that's being Reclassed to the manager too as the creative industry manager will be really the only individual staff who will be, you know, 100% dedicated to thinking kind of strategically around creative industry issues and policy development.",79,,
562,0.97,3824.42,3826.956,"Thank you, Yolanda.",80,,
563,0.97,3826.956,3834.597,And I know I used this STAT a lot and I'm afraid I'm not going to get it right this time.,80,,
564,0.97,3834.597,3836.699,I don't have my notes in front of me.,80,,
565,0.97,3836.699,3855.351,"But I just want to remind everybody that the contribution to our city's GDP from arts and culture is, I believe it's five times the average GDP nationally.",80,,
566,0.97,3855.351,3861.457,So this is a really important component of our economy.,80,,
567,0.97,3861.457,3874.604,"And I am, again, who it's film and music or more broadly creative industry, I am really concerned by our continued subordination of this particular focus.",80,,
568,0.97,3874.904,3877.907,Thanks.,80,,
569,0.97,3879.709,3884.28,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold and thanks for your leadership on that area as well.",80,,
570,0.97,3884.28,3888.417,Is there any additional comments or questions?,80,,
571,0.97,3890.219,3894.39,"Councilmember Morales, did you have any last comments?",80,,
572,0.97,3894.39,3895.391,Councilmember President Gonzales?,80,,
573,0.97,3895.391,3896.792,Were there comments from you?,80,,
574,0.97,3896.792,3897.36,Okay great.,80,,
575,0.97,3897.36,3898.761,Thank you very much.,81,,
576,0.97,3898.761,3899.929,Thank you.,82,,
577,0.97,3899.929,3905.501,"Well, I do think that that does bring us to the end of this presentation.",83,,
578,0.97,3905.501,3908.371,"Yolanda, did you have anything else you'd like to share?",83,,
579,0.97,3908.371,3911.374,We did get some information.,84,,
580,0.97,3911.374,3918.648,The executive level is someone who manages managers.,84,,
581,0.97,3918.648,3920.983,That's additional clarification for these purposes.,84,,
582,0.97,3920.983,3923.753,Thank you very much.,85,,
583,0.97,3923.753,3934.697,"With that, Yolanda, if there are additional questions specific to Oed, we know where to find you, colleagues, reach out if you have questions for Yolanda or Allie who is on the screen here.",85,,
584,0.97,3934.697,3936.899,We're going to have another long day tomorrow.,85,,
585,0.97,3936.899,3939.368,I'm happy to give you the gift of time back this afternoon.,85,,
586,0.97,3939.368,3947.743,"We'll have the opportunity to go through office of planning community development, human services, human services and community led investments.",85,,
587,0.97,3947.743,3952.214,And then the afternoon really get into homelessness and homelessness services.,85,,
588,0.97,3952.214,3970.066,"I also will flag for folks if there's questions or comments that you didn't have the chance to ask about other departments that have not featured today and tomorrow or on Friday, if we have extra time at the end of tomorrow's meeting, we of course would love to hear any ideas you'd like to put out there at this early stage.",85,,
589,0.97,3970.066,3974.136,Recognizing it's early and you don't have to share all the ideas that may be in the harbor.,85,,
590,0.97,3974.136,3981.11,"But if you'd like to use time at the end of tomorrow's meeting assuming we have extra time like we did today, you're welcome to do that.",85,,
591,0.97,3981.11,3985.414,I wanted to give you a heads up about the possibility at tend of tomorrow's meeting.,85,,
592,0.97,3985.414,3987.55,Friday we do have another long day.,85,,
593,0.97,3987.55,3991.887,We will be concluding with public safety.,85,,
594,0.97,3991.887,3999.228,And wrapping up our afternoon with the Department overview in Seattle police departments.,85,,
595,0.97,3999.228,4009.672,"So I appreciate your generous time today and Allie, if there's nothing else from you, we'll see you tomorrow, along with all of our colleagues here.",85,,
596,0.97,4009.672,4010.706,Today's meeting is adjourned.,85,,
597,0.97,4010.706,4013.743,See you tomorrow morning at 9:30:00 A.M.,85,,
598,0.97,4013.743,4015.911,"Have a great afternoon colleagues, good-bye.",85,,
599,0.97,4016.145,4018.914,Thank you.,86,,
