30,0.97,168.768,190.49,So I see a number of people are signed up to discuss issues not on the agenda or in the land use and neighborhoods committee namely West green Lake way North which many people have already heard my stance which we need to reopen the road with a two Lane protected bike Lane on the Lake side of the road.,10,,

64,0.97,397.23,420.953,"Sylvia Stewart, are you with us?",18,,

66,0.97,421.654,421.988,I'm here.,19,,
67,0.97,421.988,423.022,Hi Sylvia,20,,
68,0.97,423.022,438.671,I was originally signed up for green Lake but I have some--well I don't agree with changing the zoning from single family to the neighborhood whatever.,21,,
69,0.97,438.671,460.793,"Um, I think we should still have single family areas in the city and I realize we have to let other people be more dense and stuff like that but I feel like our city is special and we don't have to do it like Chicago, like New York and we don't have to just up zone and let developers have a hay day and build whatever they want anywhere.",21,,
70,0.97,460.793,496.195,"What we should do if we are going to keep our city beautiful is get some architects to look at each neighborhood in a fashion and find out what are the best--keeping the characters of that neighborhood, where are the best places to up Sxoen how could we do this in a way we keep our city beautiful for years to come and still save some single family areas which have the tree canopy and everything like that.",21,,
71,0.97,496.195,496.996,And do it that way.,21,,
72,0.97,496.996,504.937,Don't do it like--you don't have to do it like other cities do it or create sprawl or whatever.,21,,
73,0.97,504.937,508.941,Do it in a Seattle way.,21,,
74,0.97,508.941,512.144,That is my comment.,21,,
75,0.97,512.144,514.614,"Thank you, Sylvia.",22,,
76,0.97,514.614,519.652,Up next we have Elizabeth and Rachel.,22,,
77,0.97,519.652,524.724,I see we have Elizabeth here to speak about West green Lake North.,22,,
78,0.97,524.724,529.295,Again this is not the appropriate Committee for that comment.,22,,
79,0.97,529.295,532.265,"Elizabeth, are you with us?",22,,
80,0.97,532.265,533.165,"Yes, I am now.",23,,
81,0.97,533.165,533.466,I'm sorry.,23,,
82,0.97,533.466,541.974,I think I missed what you said but I think you don't want us to talk about the Rvs taking up parking.,23,,
83,0.97,541.974,547.046,This is not the select homelessness committee or the Trarns Pooration committee or the parks committee.,24,,
84,0.97,547.046,548.781,This is the land use committee.,24,,
85,0.97,548.781,551.851,If there is an item you would like to speak about.,24,,
86,0.97,551.851,553.653,Well the road closure.,25,,
87,0.97,553.653,555.788,The road closure around green Lake.,25,,
88,0.97,555.788,558.424,This is not the correct committee.,26,,
89,0.97,558.424,561.427,There will be a meeting tonight though I will be attending.,26,,
90,0.97,561.427,561.727,"Oh, okay.",27,,
91,0.97,561.727,561.994,I'm sorry.,27,,
92,0.97,561.994,569.969,Social media somebody--somebody recommended me to talk about the use of that road.,27,,
93,0.97,569.969,570.77,Okay.,27,,
94,0.97,570.77,577.143,I will see you tonight.,28,,
95,0.97,577.143,577.41,Thanks.,29,,
96,0.97,577.41,577.576,Bye.,29,,
97,0.97,577.576,589.488,"Clerk or--Mr. G, can--are there no further public commentators signed up?",30,,
98,0.97,589.488,599.398,"As far as I can tell, I believe it is all public hearing.",31,,
99,0.97,599.398,599.865,Great.,32,,
100,0.97,599.865,600.433,Thank you.,32,,
101,0.97,600.433,612.244,"Seeing as we have no additional speakers remotely present, we will move on to the next agenda item.",32,,
102,0.97,612.244,623.556,And Mr.--will you please read--or I guess our first item of business is a public hearing on the proposed comprehensive plan amendment to update the name.,32,,
103,0.97,623.556,628.995,Will you please read the short title of this into the record?,32,,
104,0.97,628.995,638.771,"Agenda item one, pro Prosed comprehensive plan amendment for neighborhood residential areas.",33,,
105,0.97,638.771,645.277,Can you provide a brief over view?,34,,
106,0.97,645.277,645.511,Sure.,35,,
107,0.97,645.511,652.985,Happy to provide that over view.,35,,
108,0.97,652.985,653.386,Good morning.,35,,
109,0.97,653.386,662.895,The proposed legislation is attached to my memo which is attached to the agenda.,35,,
110,0.97,662.895,674.24,It propose as number of amendments the comprehensive plan to shift the name of what are currently called single family residential areas to neighborhood residential areas.,35,,
111,0.97,674.24,693.159,Changes would be made to the land use housing and 17 neighborhood plans where the term single family residential area shows up and replace those references with neighborhood residential.,35,,
112,0.97,693.159,700.966,The idea is to recognize that--these are areas that have broader set of land uses than just single family detached homes.,35,,
113,0.97,700.966,707.706,They are the places where we have most of our parks in opened spaces.,35,,
114,0.97,707.706,717.016,They are where most of our schools are located and they also--have multi-family uses in them.,35,,
115,0.97,717.016,728.828,For example the residential small lot zone which is classified as a single family residential area is a zone that allows townhouses and apartments as well as single family detached homes.,35,,
116,0.97,728.828,745.044,The idea is to better reflect the character of those areas to day and to size up for a conversation about the future use of those areas as part of the next major update to the plan.,35,,
117,0.97,745.044,746.879,I'm happy to answer any questions.,35,,
118,0.97,746.879,748.547,Thank you Mr. Whitson.,36,,
119,0.97,748.547,751.951,I'm pleased to be Co-Sponsoring this amendment with Council member Mosqueda.,36,,
120,0.97,751.951,759.391,I believe that language really does matter.,36,,
121,0.97,759.525,792.925,[Indiscernible] I know in my neighborhood there are many Duplexes that are now in single family zones that could not be Fwoilt day that reflect the character of our neighborhood and provide for that meaningful density of having more people.,36,,
122,0.97,792.925,801.433,While this is--can you please confirm this is just a name change and we are not adjusting policy today.,36,,
123,0.97,801.433,802.234,Is that correct?,36,,
124,0.97,802.234,803.235,That is correct.,37,,
125,0.97,803.235,809.742,I realized I forgot answer the second part of your initial question.,37,,
126,0.97,809.742,821.187,"The intent is to enter this legislation after this public hearing, bring it to the committee in September for consideration along side other amendments proposed by the Mayor.",37,,
127,0.97,821.187,831.33,And it would be followed by potential amendments to the land use code following adoption of the complaint.,37,,
128,0.97,831.33,831.664,Thank you.,38,,
129,0.97,831.664,835.568,Do you have anything you would like share at this time?,38,,
130,0.97,835.568,839.138,"Thank you very much, Mr. chair.",39,,
131,0.97,839.138,844.51,Appreciate the opportunity to work with you and your leadership and Co-Sponsorship and legislation.,39,,
132,0.97,844.51,848.881,Thank you for the outline and your detailed analysis of the proposal in front of us.,39,,
133,0.97,848.881,853.219,I want to thank you Mr. chair for the words you used.,39,,
134,0.97,853.219,854.453,You are right.,39,,
135,0.97,854.453,863.562,Language matters and this is an update to the name.,39,,
136,0.97,863.562,873.005,This legislation constitutes a technical change.,39,,
137,0.97,873.005,877.443,"Has legacy, it has roots and zoning practices.",39,,
138,0.97,877.443,892.958,Also the great work of Opcd and their team along with partners.,39,,
139,0.97,892.958,898.664,I think that that has been well covered document and appreciate the Seattle times coverage of it yesterday.,39,,
140,0.97,898.664,912.945,"I think what we are trying to do with this legislation here is a very narrow change recognizes we need a more inclusive, more accurate name such as neighborhood residential or perhaps neighborhood family residential.",39,,
141,0.97,912.945,920.219,We will hear more today to help recognize that these neighborhoods are already home to diverse housing types.,39,,
142,0.97,920.219,946.378,Diverse housing types built before we increasingly shrunk the area where Seattle could build multi-family structures and we want to make sure as Lish noted that there is already diverse types around so we are having a name that truly recognized our fabric of our city needs to be representative of more than just single family only.,39,,
143,0.97,946.378,950.282,The single family only designation does not reflect the current make up.,39,,
144,0.97,950.282,959.725,We have Duplexes and Row houses in the apartment I used to live in that is zoned as single family only.,39,,
145,0.97,959.725,963.796,We need a more accurate name than the one that has been with us since 1994.,39,,
146,0.97,963.796,985.718,We I think are on a path to help make sure language is inclusive and we are reflecting the diverse make up of the community and we begin this conversation about how we both address the zoning policies needed along with Anti-Displacement strategies.,39,,
147,0.97,985.718,989.655,I believe the timing is right for this proposal.,39,,
148,0.97,989.655,996.695,I am not sure if folks have the chance to review back to the 2018 planning Commission reports.,39,,
149,0.97,996.695,1015.547,Every year they have been asking the city to act on the recommendation and to change the name of single family only to more appropriately create a--title that is more reflective of our zoning and they have requested this in anticipation of the comprehensive plan update.,39,,
150,0.97,1015.547,1022.321,Since 2018 the city Council has requested this change to the inclusive of the annual comprehensive amendments proposed by the executive.,39,,
151,0.97,1022.321,1064.997,"We are drawing from these repeated requests and the support--broad support from community--[Indiscernible] I am very proud to be working with you, Mr. chair, on this legislation and want to thank the community organizations who have been asking for something like this including the community housing Roundtables which we convene quarterly members--[Indiscernible] folks who have been working with and led by community members and serving community members.",39,,
152,0.97,1064.997,1087.119,There is a letter of nearly 400 individuals and organizations who are within communities within the 17 neighborhoods whose neighborhood plan is currently using the term single family that would potentially be affected who have written in in support and we have had a conversation with folks in the community Association last week.,39,,
153,0.97,1087.119,1089.922,We spoke with members from Highland park.,39,,
154,0.97,1089.922,1099.698,We are happy to virtually attend any community meeting and talk more about the proposal to make sure folks understand the narrow scope of this legislation.,39,,
155,0.97,1099.698,1118.65,The importance from the historical perspective and why it is important to I think address both fears about displacement and development we can do that when we have a document that more accurately reflects the fabric of our neighborhoods so we can begin a conversation from a more inclusive place.,39,,
156,0.97,1118.65,1140.639,"Mr. chair I would like to thank them for their support for this effort along with the housing development, Seattle South side Chamber of Commerce, and the other 60 E-Mails we have received in support of this effort here today.",39,,
157,0.97,1140.639,1152.484,We want to do the most we can to educate our community about why this narrow piece is important at this time in the process.,39,,
158,0.97,1152.484,1153.886,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",39,,
159,0.97,1153.886,1178.243,"I appreciate you highlighting the fact a number of times is very narrow in scope that this is a name change only and does not change policy and while this is a small step in and changing a name will not solve all the problems, using a more inclusive name reflects the reality on the ground and does move us in the right--right direction.",40,,
160,0.97,1178.243,1180.579,Any other question before we open public comment?,40,,
161,0.97,1180.579,1188.353,I want to say your team has been tremendous as well along with Lish.,41,,
162,0.97,1188.353,1188.987,Thank you so much.,41,,
163,0.97,1188.987,1198.463,"I know they have done a tremendous amount of research on this topic along with you as well, Mr. chair.",41,,
164,0.97,1198.463,1199.831,Thank you.,42,,
165,0.97,1199.831,1203.135,We have nearly 30 people signed up for public comment.,42,,
166,0.97,1203.135,1206.805,We will limit comment to one minute.,42,,
167,0.97,1206.805,1217.716,Before we--open the remote public hearing I would ask that everyone please be patient as we don't learn and operate the system--this new system Realtime and navigate through the growing pains.,42,,
168,0.97,1217.716,1224.089,We are looking for ways to fine tune this process and adding new features.,42,,
169,0.97,1224.089,1226.625,I will moderate the public hearing in the following manner.,42,,
170,0.97,1226.625,1228.46,Each Speaker will be given one minute to speak.,42,,

190,0.97,1331.396,1338.937,I am here today to speak in support of the proposed rename from single family to neighborhood residential.,43,,
191,0.97,1338.937,1344.976,Today over 70% of our city's residential land is reserved.,43,,
192,0.97,1344.976,1352.784,This encourages sprawl and ensures our best public amenities disproportionately benefit wealthy white residents.,43,,
193,0.97,1352.784,1359.291,I think building a sustainable and equitable city Requirestous be more welcoming.,43,,
194,0.97,1359.291,1359.758,Language does matter.,43,,

204,0.97,1392.724,1398.263,I am here to speak in support of changing the name of single family areas to neighborhood residential areas.,45,,
205,0.97,1398.263,1403.835,We want to thank the council member for bringing this forward and chair Strauss for Co-Sponsoring.,45,,
206,0.97,1403.835,1410.942,The name single family is not reflective of the neighborhoods we have today.,45,,
207,0.97,1410.942,1419.451,Many single family areas have multiple city dwellings that were constructed before.,45,,
208,0.97,1419.451,1429.895,Seattle must take action.,45,,
209,0.97,1432.831,1449.181,"We stand ready to work with Council and the city to ensure Seattle continues to make changes to promote density so Seattle has more housing of all types which is vital to the competitive, equitable and inclusive economy chamber works toward.",45,,

227,0.97,1495.927,1505.303,"I believe this will help the city of Seattle begin to address the long standing issues of equity, race and social justice within our current zoning limitations.",49,,
228,0.97,1505.303,1512.711,I agree with many of the specifics identified.,49,,
229,0.97,1512.711,1522.053,A few allow for greater range of housing types given the challenges we have today in our city.,49,,
230,0.97,1522.053,1539.638,I also want to propose that we look beyond this to the future and hope to see fantastic efforts from the Council and our community.,49,,
231,0.97,1539.638,1545.577,Building more efforts towards Inkwlusive communities.,49,,

235,0.97,1548.046,1548.48,Hi.,51,,
236,0.97,1548.48,1549.814,My name is Robin.,51,,
237,0.97,1549.814,1550.148,Good morning.,51,,
238,0.97,1550.148,1557.789,I am calling in to ask for your support for the Noim change.,51,,
239,0.97,1557.789,1566.131,The new name will reflect our goal to this area and is a first step to lining the zoning more closely with our values of the community.,51,,
240,0.97,1566.131,1571.736,I look forward to future changes and thank you for allowing me to speak.,51,,
241,0.97,1571.736,1572.637,"Thank you, Robin.",52,,
242,0.97,1572.637,1581.112,Up next we have Alice followed by Laura and then on deck patience.,52,,
243,0.97,1581.112,1581.579,"Alice, good morning.",52,,
244,0.97,1581.579,1584.182,Good morning.,53,,
245,0.97,1584.182,1585.05,I'm Alice from 350 Seattle.,53,,
246,0.97,1585.05,1590.388,We wholeheartedly welcome the change to neighborhood residential and the conversation that will follow.,53,,
247,0.97,1590.388,1593.692,We have several hopes for this conversation.,53,,
248,0.97,1593.692,1611.576,We urge that the plan leverage the findings and recommendations of the recently released racial equity analysis of the Seattle 2035 comprehensive plan in an urban village strategy and also a racial equity tool kit for this COMP plan update.,53,,
249,0.97,1611.576,1622.787,The urban village strategy led to huge development pressure in our city's neighborhoods while preserving Exclusionary zoning in the suburbs we call single family zones.,53,,
250,0.97,1622.787,1628.66,And has exacerbated wealth and inequality.,53,,
251,0.97,1628.66,1633.999,This has led to a huge wave of displacement.,53,,
252,0.97,1633.999,1639.037,The update must be done on concert with hard work to address these harms.,53,,
253,0.97,1639.037,1647.512,Secondly we urge everyone involved to think Inclusively about the term neighborhood residential.,53,,
254,0.97,1647.512,1661.259,"Everyone from the Council President to the Mayor is on board with the term 15 minute neighborhoods which are transit, dense --",53,,
255,0.97,1661.259,1663.995,"Thank you, Alice.",54,,
256,0.97,1663.995,1671.469,Please feel free to send in any additional comments.,54,,
257,0.97,1671.469,1681.713,Good morning.,54,,
258,0.97,1682.18,1687.352,What happened in Seattle impacts cities across the country.,54,,
259,0.97,1687.352,1691.389,A small issue might seem insignificant to many.,54,,
260,0.97,1691.389,1705.537,What it Indicateds is we are finally willing to admit that the type of protectionism that has long been the rule of land use communities is shifting.,54,,
261,0.97,1705.537,1725.857,Listening to comments is income Pantable with climate friendly cities.,54,,
262,0.97,1725.857,1731.463,It is at the extent of Renters.,54,,
263,0.97,1731.463,1741.706,Please support the neighborhood residential change and also support deep Anti-Displacement.,54,,
264,0.97,1741.706,1747.746,Thank you Chlt.,54,,

269,0.97,1761.459,1773.838,I am calling to express our support for the name change of single family zoning to neighborhood residential.,56,,
270,0.97,1773.972,1779.811,[Indiscernible] I am thrilled you are moving forward with this proposal.,56,,
271,0.97,1779.811,1789.454,It recognizes the problem with the name goes deeper than being misrepresented.,56,,
272,0.97,1789.454,1796.995,Single family zoning has never been a neutral planning tool.,56,,
273,0.97,1796.995,1810.975,We are laying the ground work to create more opportunities for day direct housing.,56,,
274,0.97,1810.975,1823.988,I thank you for your leadership on this very important.,56,,

291,0.97,1893.491,1913.411,This change will provide these areas with more accurate title that better reflects the diversity of households now living with them and will provide an important first step towards making these areas more equitable and accessible.,58,,
292,0.97,1913.544,1939.037,[Indiscernible].,58,,
293,0.97,1952.951,1953.484,Thank you.,59,,

301,0.97,1980.111,1993.324,I can't wait for the name to reflect the housing options that already exist.,62,,
302,0.97,1993.324,2012.276,The plan must take action to allow policy changes in our zoning system and strong Anti-Displacement strategies to show a deep commitment to racial equity.,62,,
303,0.97,2012.276,2022.72,Communities have suffered.,62,,
304,0.97,2024.622,2026.824,The urban village strategy is perpetuating a pattern.,62,,
305,0.97,2026.824,2035.199,I can't wait to change the name and further down road change the zoning itself.,62,,
306,0.97,2035.199,2036.968,Thank you.,62,,

314,0.97,2057.989,2058.89,My name is Zoey Jenkins.,64,,
315,0.97,2058.89,2065.029,I am addressing the single family zone item.,64,,
316,0.97,2065.029,2066.097,I'm a resident.,64,,
317,0.97,2066.097,2075.339,I would suggest the term single household instead which is more inclusive language.,64,,
318,0.97,2075.339,2080.578,Residential neighborhoods can lead to a lot of growth and Multiplex structures.,64,,
319,0.97,2080.578,2085.149,These tend to be large three story Plat exterior wall structures.,64,,
320,0.97,2085.149,2087.718,There is a severe loss of trees and light and space when they occur.,64,,
321,0.97,2087.718,2096.928,We don't have a power grid to support more density as we already know.,64,,
322,0.97,2096.928,2101.199,So lets help our small businesses grow.,64,,
323,0.97,2101.199,2109.207,Let's help our big businesses develop salt Lites into the neighboring communities.,64,,
324,0.97,2109.207,2127.725,Lets help people who need jobs lets help everyone in the King County region have growth and stability rather than over--dense guy Seattle.,64,,
325,0.97,2127.725,2130.728,If I Seattle.,64,,

334,0.97,2140.605,2142.974,I'm the executive director of future wise.,68,,
335,0.97,2142.974,2149.48,I'm here to comment in support of the name change to neighborhood residential.,68,,
336,0.97,2149.48,2151.682,There are two reasons I want to highlight.,68,,
337,0.97,2151.682,2160.491,I think this is an important step towards getting the city out of the business of defining who is a family.,68,,
338,0.97,2160.491,2164.762,For many of us biology and a marriage license are not the only things that hold our families together.,68,,
339,0.97,2164.762,2170.334,This would bring Seattle more in line with new state law under Senate bill 5325.,68,,
340,0.97,2170.334,2187.652,I'm also in support of this change because I think it sets the stage for a city wide conversation act how our neighborhood residential areas can better meet our city's housing needs and address the history of race and cost based exclusion this parts of the city.,68,,
341,0.97,2187.652,2188.052,Thank you.,68,,
342,0.97,2188.052,2196.928,Up next we have matt followed by Rick and Ryan is on deck.,69,,

350,0.97,2216.948,2220.952,It is clear we have been losing ground.,72,,
351,0.97,2220.952,2237.101,"It is clear our current planning strategies are Disadvantaging communities, opening up Gentrification.",72,,
352,0.97,2237.101,2238.102,We are fuelling these Phenomenons.,72,,
353,0.97,2238.102,2253.918,We have a land use code stuck in the past.,72,,
354,0.97,2255.653,2267.999,We are asking--if we can switch out these words we will be well on our way to creating a more diverse welcomed neighborhood.,72,,

402,0.97,2528.058,2533.664,The pace at which we change our zoning plan is slow.,82,,
403,0.97,2533.664,2536.967,It has been six years.,82,,
404,0.97,2536.967,2549.313,I applaud Council member Mosqueda for restarting this conversation and commissioning the racial equity tool kit on the strategy.,82,,
405,0.97,2549.313,2556.987,The findings of that study were striking and Unam Biggous.,82,,
406,0.97,2556.987,2566.597,It is accelerating the displacement of black and Brown people from our city.,82,,
407,0.97,2566.597,2571.402,It is not compatible with solutions.,82,,

428,0.97,2658.389,2662.493,In my neighborhood many nice old apartment buildings are smacked next to $2 million homes.,85,,
429,0.97,2662.493,2666.964,Those homes and their value don't seem to suffer.,85,,
430,0.97,2666.964,2672.369,Instead the apartments and condos make the neighborhood more vibrant.,85,,
431,0.97,2672.369,2681.412,The fact we can't build those apartments and condos now has to change.,85,,
432,0.97,2681.412,2687.484,Changing can name speaks to what matters about neighborhood.,85,,
433,0.97,2687.484,2695.526,"It is a neighborhood, mostly resident.",85,,

461,0.97,2958.655,2966.196,The Council can give due process and ideas from what it constitutes and maybe too small to make the docket.,87,,
462,0.97,2966.196,2974.571,I think we could work our way through the current housing crisis with a smaller property as it is.,87,,
463,0.97,2974.571,2997.194,So we just--love to encourage the Council to help us move this Forwad so we can fulfill our--um--what we to the community in being a 35 year resident and give back as much as we can as we have outgrown the site for ourselves.,87,,

476,0.97,3044.341,3051.081,Will you please read the abbreviated title into the record.,88,,
477,0.97,3051.081,3068.298,An ordinance related to land use and zoning adopting interim provisions by amending code--Sdmrrn thank you.,89,,
478,0.97,3068.298,3075.505,"We are joined by interim director Rico Quirindongo and Magda Hogness, Mike Podowski and Ketil Freeman do.",89,,

482,0.97,3101.665,3105.602,I'm happy to go through that.,90,,
483,0.97,3105.602,3107.137,Thank you.,91,,
484,0.97,3107.137,3107.637,Take it away.,91,,
485,0.97,3107.637,3108.805,Good morning.,92,,
486,0.97,3108.805,3111.274,Thank you Council member Strauss for the time today.,92,,
487,0.97,3111.274,3140.403,The legislation we are here to talk about today is in direct response to--the terrible impact the pandemic has had on our business community as I think most people are aware we lost over 40 had 0 businesses in the core due to the pandemic and the need for people to stay at home.,92,,
488,0.97,3140.403,3181.011,The opportunity that we are seeking at this time is to open up our land use--well opportunities to create new business opportunities in the core for folks to bring in different types of businesses and uses that previously were not allowed due to the restriction of restaurants and retail in our retail core doors.,92,,
489,0.97,3181.011,3185.515,"Um, I will turnover the Mic to Magda in a moment.",92,,
490,0.97,3185.515,3205.936,"I want to say as we look to recovery, we are looking to bring people back like revitalize and get people back in downtown and signal reopening.",92,,
491,0.97,3205.936,3211.942,So this temporary legislation is one of many different vehicles for the city to do that.,92,,
492,0.97,3211.942,3220.183,With that I will hand it over to Magda.,92,,
493,0.97,3220.183,3221.851,"Thank you, Rico.",93,,
494,0.97,3221.851,3233.463,As Rico mentioned this is one piece of an approach that has many related efforts.,93,,
495,0.97,3233.463,3243.206,It is focused in on the street level ground floor within a specific area of downtown.,93,,
496,0.97,3243.206,3260.857,Filling vacant store fronts and existing buildings is a shared priority in the immediate term survival and a broader economic recovery.,93,,
497,0.97,3260.857,3266.363,The latest numbers that showed the latest figures from June this year showed this need.,93,,
498,0.97,3266.363,3294.858,"This area which is focused on the proposed legislation you are seeing today has seen over 340 businesses close over the past year and a half and of that approximately half have already been filled with new businesses and just for a little bit of context, Pre-Pandemic the number of closures was usually consistent--was usually less than number of new openings.",93,,
499,0.97,3294.858,3297.027,Each time Dsa conducted this inventory.,93,,
500,0.97,3297.027,3300.497,So the number of businesses would always continue to grow.,93,,
501,0.97,3300.497,3311.708,What we are looking at here is we know that there is a need for additional help the market will do on its own.,93,,
502,0.97,3311.708,3324.02,And that this legislation is just one piece of supporting downtown recovery and all of the other good projects which we will touch on a little bit later on in this presentation.,93,,
503,0.97,3324.02,3325.155,With that I will pass --,93,,
504,0.97,3325.155,3328.925,I have one question on this slide before I move on.,94,,
505,0.97,3328.925,3342.172,Data from the downtown Seattle Association also shows 2.5% retail vacancy rate downtown in 2020 compared to a 3 to 4% vacancy rate from 2010 to 2020.,94,,
506,0.97,3342.172,3354.918,Can you or do you know how many of these are permanent closures and new openings and how this compares to a Pre-Pandemic year?,94,,
507,0.97,3354.918,3355.385,Certainly.,95,,
508,0.97,3355.385,3365.495,I think that will--I can explain a little bit and might require some follow up.,95,,
509,0.97,3365.495,3384.28,But what you are seeing here is the number of businesses that have permanently closed over the past year and a half at the ground level versus an end reopening.,95,,
510,0.97,3384.28,3396.826,So Dsa is doing more of fine grain look into this area and how it relates to their vacancy rates overall is something we will need to follow up on.,95,,
511,0.97,3396.826,3414.11,Again the Pre-Pandemic we did reach out to them to kind of understand what the difference is in and would be in a Pre-Pandemic in the past and this number of closures was always less than the number of new openings.,95,,
512,0.97,3414.11,3423.453,I get the sense that that is related to new construction and might be an additional layer of information there.,95,,
513,0.97,3423.453,3426.556,We will be happy to report back.,95,,
514,0.97,3426.556,3427.123,Thank you.,96,,
515,0.97,3427.123,3428.591,"Vice chair Mosqueda, please.",96,,
516,0.97,3428.591,3430.593,Thank you very much.,97,,
517,0.97,3430.593,3433.196,Appreciate the clarification ton permanent closures here.,97,,
518,0.97,3433.196,3444.407,"One of my questions is do you have similar data looking at other neighborhood hubs across our city, West Seattle, central district, North gate.",97,,
519,0.97,3444.407,3448.978,Are there similar Statistics we can look at?,97,,
520,0.97,3448.978,3467.964,"We--so Dsa does Kwlekt data from additional neighborhoods but they are focused in closer to downtown so South Lake Union as well as first Hill, lower queen Ann or uptown or included.",98,,
521,0.97,3467.964,3475.605,I don't think the data does include information on West Seattle.,98,,
522,0.97,3475.605,3477.941,That is something we can provide more context on.,98,,
523,0.97,3477.941,3481.811,Just another follow up if I may.,99,,
524,0.97,3481.811,3499.762,"Um, do we though--does the city have any data points of its own data is they shared with us to have a better indication of store front closures across the city?",99,,
525,0.97,3499.762,3518.681,So the--we have worked with Oab to--get a sense of the--what the changes might be and one point of data we could collect is the business licensing information.,100,,
526,0.97,3518.681,3536.966,As a whole Dsa--as what they have done multiple surveys and that I believe is how they are collecting this fine grain information which is more up to date than business licenses.,100,,
527,0.97,3536.966,3537.2,Okay.,101,,
528,0.97,3537.2,3539.469,Thanks so much.,101,,
529,0.97,3539.469,3541.771,"Again, thank you very much for your work.",101,,
530,0.97,3541.771,3561.791,One other thing I would be interested in--is either data on child care closures as well.,101,,
531,0.97,3561.791,3568.598,I think we are interested in seeing how we can support more businesses coming down town and to neighborhood hubs across Seattle.,101,,
532,0.97,3568.598,3580.076,We continue to hear from businesses that one of the things they need is child care for them as small business owners or for their workers as well.,101,,
533,0.97,3580.076,3587.817,"If there is anyway to get that data, we are interested as well.",101,,
534,0.97,3587.817,3588.685,"Thank you guys, chair.",102,,
535,0.97,3588.685,3594.857,"Mike, did you want to--or Magda is passing it to Mike is I think how I interrupted this a moment ago.",102,,
536,0.97,3594.857,3597.827,"Mike, feel free to take it away",102,,
537,0.97,3597.827,3602.532,"Yes, of course.",103,,
538,0.97,3602.532,3603.633,"Next slide, please.",104,,
539,0.97,3603.633,3610.907,Now we will turn to the proposal.,105,,
540,0.97,3610.907,3614.243,It is focused on existing buildings.,105,,
541,0.97,3614.243,3631.561,We are making use of some state rules that allow for expedition adoption of the legislation and then that would also allow it to be in place for a temporary amount of time.,105,,
542,0.97,3631.561,3632.962,We are proposing 12 months.,105,,
543,0.97,3632.962,3639.669,Business would be good to operate.,105,,
544,0.97,3639.669,3651.614,"We are focussing on the areas in town where the land use code limits uses as director corn mentioned to basically retail uses, restaurants and entertainment uses.",105,,
545,0.97,3651.614,3663.092,"Things that seem to be suffering in particular in this area with the loss of convention Goers, t office workers concentrated in the area as well as the drop off in tourist.",105,,
546,0.97,3663.092,3683.012,So the proposal would apply to a series of map streets that really fill the area between Pike place market and the convention center and extend North and South out of downtown along some of the major path ways to the neighborhoods as well as Pioneer square.,105,,
547,0.97,3683.012,3692.555,We noted in the slide that Chinatown International districts enjoys a situation more flexible that we propose to expend into Pioneer square.,105,,
548,0.97,3692.555,3706.269,There are no changes to Chinatown that are proposed in this bill as they already enjoy the amount of flexibility we are hoping to in part on the remaining areas shown on the map.,105,,
549,0.97,3706.269,3729.992,As we expand the list of uses we are moving away from what most people consider to be the most active uses but we think there is some ways we could allow the expanded list of types of businesses to be located here and still pro--provide the most maximum amount of interest they can.,105,,
550,0.97,3729.992,3742.939,"As mentioned in the first point, we are using some special state legislation.",105,,
551,0.97,3742.939,3754.45,We will do our environmental work for the legislation after Council ADOPTS it probably in the late summer or early fall.,105,,
552,0.97,3754.45,3756.652,"Next slide, please.",105,,
553,0.97,3756.652,3756.786,.,105,,
554,0.97,3756.786,3760.59,"Mike, on that last--sorry, Hi one question.",106,,
555,0.97,3760.59,3767.864,Can you speak to why South Lake Union uptown and first Hill were not included in this legislation?,106,,
556,0.97,3767.864,3772.068,As you can see it is rather extensively mapped downtown.,107,,
557,0.97,3772.068,3780.243,There is a broad area around what we call the retail core as well as in Pioneer square where we limit what can happen at street level.,107,,
558,0.97,3780.243,3792.588,In these other neighborhoods that you mentioned that the mapping is nowhere near as extensive even though the limited uses are similar.,107,,
559,0.97,3792.588,3799.128,In could--this could be a first step.,107,,
560,0.97,3799.128,3807.503,We are trying to focus on the areas mostly affected.,107,,
561,0.97,3807.503,3807.97,Thank you.,108,,
562,0.97,3807.97,3809.305,I see Council member Lewis.,108,,
563,0.97,3809.305,3836.232,I thought your question might be a good opportunity to flag an amendment I am intending to bring for this legislation when we finally continue it for--or have that process on voting on it at the next committee meeting to extend these land use changes to the South Lake Union neighborhood.,109,,
564,0.97,3836.232,3841.137,This is based on extensive stake holder outreach to my office.,109,,
565,0.97,3841.137,3843.973,I was going to flag my amendments later.,109,,
566,0.97,3843.973,3846.976,I think that will be amendment 1 that I'm pursuing.,109,,
567,0.97,3846.976,3853.349,I thought this would be a good opportunity based on your question to flag that.,109,,
568,0.97,3853.349,3855.484,Thank you Council member Lewis.,110,,
569,0.97,3855.484,3865.828,Intide--fantastic.,110,,
570,0.97,3869.098,3878.674,It is drawn largely from the uses that are already allowed in our neighborhood business districts.,111,,
571,0.97,3878.674,3892.588,This broader range of flexibility and the types of businesses and uses that that can be located is already enjoyed in places like Ballard and the West Seattle junction Pashthss of Southeast Seattle as well as the central district and Capitol Hill.,111,,
572,0.97,3892.588,3897.026,We have looked at some uses here that could served range of needs.,111,,
573,0.97,3897.026,3908.404,I will pull out a couple for example at the top left.,111,,
574,0.97,3908.404,3910.039,People talk about pop up businesses.,111,,
575,0.97,3910.039,3918.147,Art installations have also been a good tool for filling vacant store fronts during periods such as this.,111,,
576,0.97,3918.147,3923.653,We are proposing to expand the ability to do that along these Street fronts.,111,,
577,0.97,3923.653,3933.462,Half we down on the left one of the things that is pretty commonly found at street level in the business districts is medical service uses.,111,,
578,0.97,3933.462,3934.33,"Doctors, dentists, physical therapists.",111,,
579,0.97,3934.33,3943.639,We think those kind of things can generate some more activity and be a good compliment to the businesses that we like to see downtown.,111,,
580,0.97,3943.639,3962.958,At the bottom on the far right in addition to the expanded list of uses we were also proposing the director would be the don director have the ability to consider uses that we didn't put on our list but that could spark more activity and interest in these areas.,111,,
581,0.97,3962.958,3980.976,So there is a little bit of a--ad hocking to allow us to consider other creative ideas that might come up.,111,,
582,0.97,3980.976,3982.178,Thank you Chlt.,112,,
583,0.97,3982.178,3988.084,Could you and maybe we should wait till the next committee.,112,,
584,0.97,3988.084,4002.365,"It would be helpful to have a crosswalk to see what is already allowed, what is being brought into this legislation, what is left out or maybe you could start by briefly speaking to it now and have a crosswalk for us at the next committee.",112,,
585,0.97,4002.365,4002.698,Absolutely.,113,,
586,0.97,4002.698,4008.003,"For people following along at home, there is such a list in the Sdci director's report.",113,,
587,0.97,4008.003,4014.744,We will pull out that information to highlight it for the next meeting.,113,,
588,0.97,4014.744,4036.399,"In this list you will see at the bottom on the left this idea has come up that for certain uses bike facilities for serving office uses or lobbies, gyms and activity areas that serve hotels and residential towers, it might be good to allow those things to occupy some of these empty store fronts.",113,,
589,0.97,4036.399,4042.838,That gets people coming and going and might free up space in the building that could serve another income producing purpose.,113,,
590,0.97,4042.838,4045.975,That is not allowed in the neighborhood business districts right now.,113,,
591,0.97,4045.975,4048.577,That would be unique to hear and something we are trying to under size.,113,,
592,0.97,4048.577,4062.558,On the flip side one of the things allowed in the business districts that we did front pose--didn't propose to include is office use.,113,,
593,0.97,4062.558,4070.766,In the business districts a lot of what we see on the second and higher floors are housing.,113,,
594,0.97,4070.766,4071.801,So that is the friend that.,113,,
595,0.97,4071.801,4075.604,Those are the two main differences I would say.,113,,
596,0.97,4075.604,4075.971,Thank you.,114,,
597,0.97,4075.971,4079.008,We will pull that out in more detail for the next meeting.,115,,
598,0.97,4079.008,4081.544,"Yeah, having a direct crosswalk would be helpful.",116,,
599,0.97,4081.544,4086.682,"Vice chair Mosqueda, did I see you had a hand?",116,,
600,0.97,4086.682,4099.929,I was just going to build on your comment Mr. chair about the additional data you would like to see for the other neighborhood business areas.,117,,
601,0.97,4099.929,4110.039,I appreciate the brief answer that there is already some additional allowance for different building types in other neighborhood hubs across the city if I understood your answer correctly.,117,,
602,0.97,4110.039,4114.477,I think it is more about an equity concern.,117,,
603,0.97,4114.477,4130.126,When you do draw the data for the I through I would like to see an analysis about what is being left out as the chair described.,117,,
604,0.97,4130.126,4131.794,It is not just about flexibility.,117,,
605,0.97,4131.794,4153.415,I think it is about the Mha exemptions we are also applying here and how we could be potentially looking at other neighborhood hubs who need similar discretion and Exempts to allow for those smaller business--district hubs to flourish.,117,,
606,0.97,4153.415,4160.122,Thank you vice chair.,118,,
607,0.97,4160.122,4166.862,"Feel free to continue on or colleagues if you have any colleagues that have questions, please raise your hand.",119,,
608,0.97,4166.862,4172.301,I think we will Segway back over to Magda and then we will wrap things up.,120,,
609,0.97,4172.301,4173.502,Just a couple of slides left.,120,,
610,0.97,4173.502,4179.508,Council member did I see your hand?,121,,
611,0.97,4179.508,4182.344,No.,122,,
612,0.97,4182.344,4185.314,I was waving at you.,122,,
613,0.97,4185.314,4185.514,Hi.,123,,
614,0.97,4185.514,4187.416,.,123,,
615,0.97,4187.416,4188.517,Ready for the next slide.,124,,
616,0.97,4188.517,4189.018,Great.,125,,
617,0.97,4189.018,4193.722,Thank you so much for the discussion and the questions related to equity.,125,,
618,0.97,4193.722,4212.942,That is definitely a piece of this that we are intentionally taking a look at and with this work we are intent to remove barriers experienced by small businesses as well as offer supporting programs.,125,,
619,0.97,4212.942,4226.689,With this ledge isolation we have been mindful and making sure it supports and does not harm businesses.,125,,
620,0.97,4226.689,4239.969,We have done a few sessions for Intentioning outreach to see what would be helpful for people to hide into Cid and Pioneer square focussing there.,125,,
621,0.97,4239.969,4292.688,And with that we are--as we mentioned earlier this is an approach with many pieces and legislation is an important piece as well as kind of creating opportunities for information gathering and--sharing ways to entice additional businesses as well as provide an openness to helping work through any issues that surface within the--different permitting requirements or different pieces that it takes to produce a business downtown and I know that Oed is working on many programs within the downtown recovery work they are doing and we are--collaborating closely with them as well.,125,,
622,0.97,4292.688,4299.428,With that I will pass it to Mike to explain a little more specifics.,125,,
623,0.97,4299.428,4315.411,"In addition to the measures coming, we are look at ways to help people that would be seeking permits to fill these vacant spaces.",126,,
624,0.97,4315.411,4316.945,We.,126,,
625,0.97,4316.945,4345.24,Are evaluate--[Indiscernible] the permit fast Illation would be part of our equity approach here.,126,,
626,0.97,4345.541,4359.488,I think we are wrapping up.,126,,
627,0.97,4359.488,4360.723,We are.,127,,
628,0.97,4360.723,4362.658,Thank you all.,128,,
629,0.97,4362.658,4363.892,"Colleagues, any other questions?",128,,
630,0.97,4363.892,4366.295,Council member Lewis I understand you have amendments to share.,128,,
631,0.97,4366.295,4370.466,Would you like to speak to those?,128,,
632,0.97,4370.466,4370.699,Yes.,129,,
633,0.97,4370.699,4372.301,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",129,,
634,0.97,4372.301,4388.05,I believe that Daniela on my staff has distributed working drafts for those amendments to the members of the committee and to your staff so I'm happy to just jump into them real quick.,129,,
635,0.97,4388.05,4400.596,One of them which I eluded to earlier was to extend the coverage area of these changes to the South Lake Union neighborhood.,129,,
636,0.97,4400.596,4429.024,South Lake Union neighborhood of course also positioning itself to have a recovery based on a more dynamic use of street level space and a lot of the stake holders in that neighborhood feel like they could take advantage of these unique and innovative opportunities to get more tenants and more unique tenants into store level activated--street level activated uses.,129,,
637,0.97,4429.024,4434.73,So look forward to bringing that amendment forward.,129,,
638,0.97,4434.73,4448.644,The second amendment that I am seeking to bring would add to the list of uses shown earlier in the presentation off the space and like manufacturing.,129,,
639,0.97,4448.644,4477.139,"So there has been a lot of interest from stake holders in the downtown Seattle Association, people working in commercial real estate and talking to perspective tenants to activate street level uses to use street level space for additional office space or for some kind of make or space like a light manufacturing use.",129,,
640,0.97,4477.139,4503.265,"Given the situation we are in where there has been a considerable amount of businesses over the course of Covid that have shuttered and won't be coming back, I want to be guided by what our partners in the real estate market are seeing in terms of demand to make innovative use of some of these spaces.",129,,
641,0.97,4503.265,4509.238,Office space and light manufacturing are not currently on the list that has come from the Department.,129,,
642,0.97,4509.238,4516.945,It is something that our partners would like to see.,129,,
643,0.97,4516.945,4526.755,I will be bringing that amendment to Expan slightly to that list of uses we discussed in that slide earlier.,129,,
644,0.97,4526.755,4534.93,Again those uses being street level office space and might manufacturing.,129,,
645,0.97,4534.93,4547.442,On amendment 3 this is a sort of technical amendment allowing administrative approval for street level changes in the Pioneer square special review district.,129,,
646,0.97,4547.442,4563.492,There are unique rules as Mr. chair is well aware in the district in terms of show swiftly we can stand up alternative street level uses.,129,,
647,0.97,4563.492,4580.876,This would simply allow the planning director administrative approval to green light some of these street level changes if buildings within the special review district wanted to incorporate one of these historically Nonconforming street level uses.,129,,
648,0.97,4580.876,4592.587,It is just a necessary change to work some of these temporary changes into the frame work of the special review district.,129,,
649,0.97,4592.587,4594.723,Currently those are the three amendments I'm pursuing.,129,,
650,0.97,4594.723,4599.795,My staff and I are talking to lots of stake holders in these neighborhoods.,129,,
651,0.97,4599.795,4605.801,It is possible that might lead to some additional amendments for consideration and anticipation in the next committee.,129,,
652,0.97,4605.801,4608.937,Currently those are the three I am working on.,129,,
653,0.97,4608.937,4617.846,Happy to talk between this meeting and the next with any committee men Betters who have any questions on these amendments.,129,,
654,0.97,4617.846,4639.968,All of them were generated with considerable stake Holdering from our partners who are working on economic develop Flment these neighborhoods and really Internalizing what this rehearing from perspective tenants and how they can best work to rebuild their neighborhoods in partnership with us here.,129,,
655,0.97,4639.968,4643.105,Thank you for giving me an opportunity to preview those.,129,,
656,0.97,4643.105,4649.745,Drafts have been distributed to all committee offices and happy to answer questions over the next few weeks.,129,,
657,0.97,4649.745,4652.514,Thank you Council member Lewis.,130,,
658,0.97,4652.514,4653.281,Having that preview is helpful.,130,,
659,0.97,4653.281,4660.355,It is my understanding the final versions have not yet been created.,130,,
660,0.97,4660.355,4663.992,Is that a Kreks understanding?,130,,
661,0.97,4663.992,4665.06,"Yes, council member Strauss.",131,,
662,0.97,4665.06,4668.663,These are working drafts is probably the best way I would phrase it.,131,,
663,0.97,4668.663,4677.539,I don't really know if they will materially change all that much in a substantive way based on where they are.,131,,
664,0.97,4677.539,4688.417,They there may be technical Tweaks and whatever in the run up to our next meeting.,131,,
665,0.97,4688.417,4688.784,Thank you.,132,,
666,0.97,4688.784,4689.084,Vice chair.,132,,
667,0.97,4689.084,4697.225,Also--Magda if you would like to stop sharing screen you are more than welcomed to.,132,,
668,0.97,4697.225,4700.429,Thank you very much Mr. chair.,133,,
669,0.97,4700.429,4706.001,I want to thank Council member Lewis as well for the preview of those amendments.,133,,
670,0.97,4706.001,4728.957,I do have some interest in following up on the permitted uses and seeing if there is any additional way that we can--Incentivize and support the creation of more child care fast--facilities as well.,133,,
671,0.97,4728.957,4755.383,We just put $5 million in our Seattle rescue plan to help support the capital--for capital dollars for the creation of additional child care facilities specifically to help our smallest businesses be able to have a draw to economic hubs including downtown so more people have safe places for their Kiddos to have care.,133,,
672,0.97,4755.383,4767.696,"As we think about recovering and having a reset button here for us to have a more equitable recovery post Covid, one of the things I would like to don't do is create more incentives for child care.",133,,
673,0.97,4767.696,4773.502,We hear that there is more Doggy day care in downtown Seattle than there is Kiddo day care.,133,,
674,0.97,4773.502,4781.376,This has been a big priority for us to make sure our Furry friends as well as our babies and Kiddos have the care they need.,133,,
675,0.97,4781.376,4791.286,So I'm very interested in seeing if there is any possibility for us to create additional incentives.,133,,
676,0.97,4791.286,4803.498,Thank you for being creative in many ways here.,133,,
677,0.97,4803.498,4816.545,"I still would like to see that data about what barriers may exist in other economic regions, economic hubs in regions of our city to see if this should be more broadly applied.",133,,
678,0.97,4816.545,4820.949,I appreciate the expansion to South Lake Union.,133,,

877,0.97,5731.926,5765.126,I want to thank central staff and the Seattle housing authority for the back and forth discussion on how to--what we are trying to do here is--because the tree canopy will be impacted here at the terrace property the request before us is to increase the flexibility for them the way it was originally worded was enabling them to replace trees off site anywhere in Seattle.,220,,
878,0.97,5765.126,5783.711,During the meeting it was clear the Seattle housing authority was going to be doing everything they can to plant those trees on site or close by so this amendment simply Memorializes that the spirit of that by saying--if you can't plan it on site then do it as close to the site as possible.,220,,
879,0.97,5783.711,5796.991,"If you can't do that, then do it at your other Seattle housing authority properties where there are low-income residents who can benefit from this traditional tree canopy.",220,,
880,0.97,5796.991,5815.109,Also going to low canopy coverage areas throughout the city so if they are going to plan replacement trees that aren't on the terrace site or within a few blocks but--there should be low tree canopy areas and we already have an assessment measuring that for the city.,220,,
881,0.97,5815.109,5832.827,But I would ask my colleagues support this so we can implement spirit of trying to keep these trees as close to possible to the low-income areas.,220,,
882,0.97,5832.827,5833.494,Thank you.,221,,
