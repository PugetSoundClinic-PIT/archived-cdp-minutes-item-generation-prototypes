16,0.97,72.806,88.822,There is a banning of the school year Evictions to be discussed of school children and families of school children and educators have been brought to our attention by educators and a member of the Seattle school board.,10,,
17,0.97,88.822,95.662,There's a discussion with great community panel that have generously given their time to come and share their stories.,10,,
18,0.97,95.662,144.811,The next meeting of the Sustainability Renters committee I hope we can take amendments and possible votes on the various bills and as the upcoming committee that I believe will have to be--we will have to set a date and my office will coordinate with the offices of the other committee members to make sure we have a date that works for everyone because it will have to be special committee meeting and at that meeting we will have the just cause bill for Councilmember Morales as I mentioned in the briefing yesterday I would like to cosponsor this bill and that is what Councilmember Morales hold off on that bill and we will be working as I said to have a good time to schedule it.,10,,
19,0.97,144.811,173.473,"Our two just cause bills aim to close the current loophole that landlords have exploited and they take a more technical approach and as we go through the discussion today and beyond I look forward to working with Councilmember Morales and the city council itself to pass a unified bill, the strongest possibility that closes the Loop holes without exception and that is what Renters urgently need and our goal.",10,,
20,0.97,173.473,182.448,Most importantly as we know from our experience of many years of winning Renter rights we will need to get organized.,10,,
21,0.97,182.448,204.938,That is why it is really important to have Renters that have been directly affected by the crisis that unfolds when we don't have Renters protected today to share with us I want to share with you before we open up for public comment two important numbers.,10,,
22,0.97,204.938,217.183,"One is 64, the days remaining after today before the current Eviction moratorium.",10,,
23,0.97,217.183,229.229,We hope to have it extended beyond June 30th but it has been difficult when the Democrats in the state Legislature joined with the Republicans to vote to end the moratorium statewide on June 30th.,10,,
24,0.97,229.229,234.2,That is effort but that is what the state's political establishment decided to do.,10,,
25,0.97,234.2,243.543,In our last office we have heard from tenants struggling in the wake of Covid and the loss of income and jobs.,10,,
26,0.97,243.543,250.717,They feel the end of the Eviction moratorium.,10,,
27,0.97,250.717,260.793,John said as many years as successful tenant with on time rents and improvements to the property I was informed that my lease would not be renewed at the end of June 2021.,10,,
28,0.97,260.793,284.017,It is important that the Council has placed some temporary protections post moratorium including giving tenants some relief if they suffer because of Covid-19 but they are temporary and they are Apprehensive about the months as those additional protections expire.,10,,
29,0.97,284.017,288.855,The trends are showing a pretty scary scenario nationally unless Renters fight back.,10,,
30,0.97,288.855,302.135,That is why it is important we pass these bills and other tenant protections before the moratorium expire and keep organizing and the movement needs to be mindful of 64 underscored.,10,,
31,0.97,302.135,309.409,The second number I wanted to share is 3.5%.,10,,
32,0.97,309.409,322.588,That is the average Seattle price increase in the last month according to a report published by the industrial rents.,10,,
33,0.97,322.588,324.257,That is rent increase of 3.5%.,10,,
34,0.97,324.257,335.134,Compounded that comes to an average Ren increase of more than 50%.,10,,
35,0.97,335.134,339.205,That is down right Mercenary.,10,,
36,0.97,339.205,344.811,Among the one hundred cities the Seattle rent increase was the 5th highest.,10,,
37,0.97,344.811,355.455,As the apartment List.Com offers said the days of plummeting rent are official behind us.,10,,
38,0.97,355.455,374.34,"So really it shows how the interest of corporate landlords and property manage corporations and the banks that Underright the real estate deals are completely open to Renters, something that they are celebrating and that is why we have to really push back against this.",10,,
39,0.97,374.34,406.939,"It is absolutely stunning admission by the captains of the real estate industry after seeing represents drop due to Covid and the recession, corporate landlords see a glimmer of economic improvement and wasting no time to exploit Seattle Renters-For anyone harboring illusions that corporate landlords will allow tenants to ease back into life after Covid this rental increase figure is a brutal reality check.",10,,
40,0.97,406.939,417.216,The pandemic is erasing no time of Seattle working class Renters and it is our job to move the bills forward to put Renters' rights before corporate profit.,10,,
41,0.97,417.216,433.232,"First this afternoon the committee will discuss our bill for permitting the Eviction of school children, their families and educators during the school year perform last week when the bill was formally introduced my office had a press unveil the bill.",10,,
42,0.97,433.232,438.538,In other words banning the Evictions of children and educators during the school year.,10,,
43,0.97,438.538,447.346,"We were joined by the Seattle Association, the Union that represents public school educators.",10,,
44,0.97,447.346,451.717,Public school student and by school board member.,10,,
45,0.97,451.717,455.721,This bans the Evictions of school children and educators during the school year.,10,,
46,0.97,455.721,475.007,It is common sense but there is research showing that when children are evicted it had devastation on their achievement and mental health.,10,,
47,0.97,475.007,477.944,Just imagine focusing on school work and getting evicted.,10,,
48,0.97,477.944,494.56,The losing home report found that of evicted respondents Ith school age Chil- point 7% said children had to moves schools after the Eviction and 80% said they suffered very much because of the Eviction.,10,,
49,0.97,494.56,502.034,In 2018 the state found that nearly 4200 Seattle public school students were homeless at some point during the school year.,10,,
50,0.97,502.034,506.105,That is a staggering 7% of all public school children.,10,,
51,0.97,506.105,515.481,Impractical terms that means that in an average class of 30 students two will be homeless at some point during the school year.,10,,
52,0.97,515.481,522.021,This is a racial justice and black lives matter matter issue.,10,,
53,0.97,522.021,528.427,Just as Seattle landlords Evict blacks at much higher rates.,10,,
54,0.97,528.427,545.811,Data found that 40% of homeless students were black and 23% of homeless students were Latinos even though the black and Latino members constitute only 14 and 12% effectively of the school population.,10,,
55,0.97,545.811,552.151,Preventing Evictions will produce this one form of system that affects students.,10,,
56,0.97,552.151,557.123,During the community panel my staff will review the staggering data in more details.,10,,
57,0.97,557.123,565.131,The facts underscore why we need to pass this legislation.,10,,
58,0.97,565.131,580.012,This fact that Eviction of children from their homes happen in one of the richest cities of the world is a Damming indictment of capitalism we should stop this during the school year.,10,,
59,0.97,580.012,582.548,The Seattle education committee has endorsed this bill.,10,,
60,0.97,582.548,612.078,Earlier our office received a message from the sea President Jennifer Matther that says last week at the representative assemble the education Association overwhelmingly support add new business item or resolution to advocate for the creation of and support existing legislation designed to help with protection against school age children with similar protections for educators and school staff during the school year including child care workers and Prek educators.,10,,

64,0.97,652.485,659.625,After this bill the committee will discuss a bill from my office to go close the loophole in the just cause Eviction ordinance.,10,,
65,0.97,659.625,678.644,We will hear from a community panel of members that have been adversely affected by the Lophole and from rental organizers that will describe what the loophole means for tens of thousands of Renters in Seattle and why we urgently need to close the loophole before it expires.,10,,
66,0.97,678.644,700.032,It was discussed at the last meeting developing the legislation as I noted it is an issue we put on our work plan for the year to fix the loophole has educated a situation where landlords can refuse to renew a lease without any cause.,10,,

68,0.97,709.308,720.519,My staff and I have been directly talking to dozens of tenants working with us to cause the just cause loophole including some of them who we will hear from this afternoon.,10,,
69,0.97,720.519,738.838,The bill from my office follows the model of the legislation passed by a grassroots movement that gathered signatures and won the stable homes initiative that created just cause Federal way and included Renters of leases.,10,,
70,0.97,738.838,746.912,There is the added urgency to do this in Seattle in 64 days.,10,,

72,0.97,755.087,765.898,We know it will take a building approach for an issue that is crucial for tens of thousands of Renters and that is what Tenners have been in touch with our office.,10,,
73,0.97,765.898,782.248,"We need to make sure our movement when closing the loophole, we have seen repeatedly how the approach can either feel or result in a watered down bill.",10,,
74,0.97,782.248,783.582,That we see.,10,,
75,0.97,783.582,797.696,We saw with the state house bill 1236 that happy statewide and Gapping loop holes for corporate landlords to exploit.,10,,

79,0.97,839.438,850.416,What is happening with greenhouse gas emission compared to what is needed looks like the edge of a cliff.,10,,
80,0.97,850.416,858.257,It will require a massive moment in green structure to be funded by increase and for that we will need a moment.,10,,

91,0.97,962.928,970.769,This volatile landscape is particularly Impactful for small mom and pop landlords that provide affordable and local rental housing.,14,,
92,0.97,970.769,975.374,A Stounsingly city Council has done no follow-up analysis.,14,,
93,0.97,975.374,978.277,We are all in the Rrio Database and easy to reach.,14,,
94,0.97,978.277,994.226,But you continue to exclude local housing providers from committee meetings and presentations and commissions and other outreach and analysts.,14,,
95,0.97,994.226,1001.567,You have deep pocketed corporate investors and city council is having a more restrictive housing market.,14,,
96,0.97,1001.567,1013.579,To improve conditions for Renters you need to collaborate with small businesses that serve them not willingly exclude us to the benefit of large corporations.,14,,

101,0.97,1040.639,1049.548,Evictions have severe consequences on children's learning and education and mental health and nine out of ten times result is homelessness.,16,,
102,0.97,1049.548,1057.823,"With that the fact that over 40,000 students in Washington state experience homelessness and you can see how urgent passing little legislation prohibiting the school year Evictions is.",16,,
103,0.97,1057.823,1063.762,The rental Committee must also expand just cause protection against Evictions to all tenants.,16,,
104,0.97,1063.762,1075.274,Ceiling has had just cause protections for tenants on month-to-month leases since 1980 but most are term leases.,16,,
105,0.97,1075.274,1083.582,This means people can be evicted giving landlords to Gentrify the city and displace neighborhoods as they please.,16,,
106,0.97,1083.582,1091.156,The legislation must be passed now and with no loop holes.,16,,

113,0.97,1124.823,1130.062,No child should be affected especially not in the middle of a health crisis.,18,,
114,0.97,1130.062,1132.998,We need a bill to expand just cause protection.,18,,
115,0.97,1132.998,1142.007,The leases are not coughed by the just cause protections and this means they can be evicted for no run at all at the end of the leases.,18,,
116,0.97,1142.007,1145.344,This is the reality for most Renters in Seattle.,18,,
117,0.97,1145.344,1162.094,Our movement composed of homeless activists and many more in the community have won Cutal rental rights victories like the ban on winter Evictions because we fought for them but there is a housing crisis and we need to win much more.,18,,

122,0.97,1187.052,1192.09,Even with the Eviction moratorium in the past month I have seen people be harassed and without clear cause.,20,,
123,0.97,1192.09,1207.606,We know that 90% of the time it end up with them on the street and now that statewide moratorium will end at the end of June it is more urgent to provide comprehensive protection from unwarranted Evictions and those happening and over the summer.,20,,
124,0.97,1207.606,1216.315,We are still battling the pandemic and the housing crisis in seems precedes the pandemic by many years.,20,,
125,0.97,1216.315,1229.895,To emphasize the landlords serving Evictions without Supportable cause are predominantly large Profiteers that want to profit from the pandemic.,20,,

132,0.97,1272.037,1283.715,Seattle has had protection for years but they are applying to month-to-month leases but we need to apply them to all leases if we want to prevent a wave of homelessness after the moratorium end.,22,,
133,0.97,1283.715,1298.063,The pandemic has altered the education of children in the entire country and family Evictions will exacerbate the damage done.,22,,

157,0.97,1451.683,1467.098,I view my small portfolio as a business and this is no different than restricting a restaurant to collect payment for food.,29,,
158,0.97,1467.098,1480.512,I also view city council's agenda [Indiscernible] conflict resolution that results in negative consequences with no compensation to landlords.,29,,
159,0.97,1480.512,1483.882,I have converted one property to Airbnbs.,29,,
160,0.97,1483.882,1488.286,Guests pay up front and there is an incentive for good behavior.,29,,
161,0.97,1488.286,1494.893,The other is to sell the owner occupants.,29,,
162,0.97,1494.893,1496.127,They are family friendly units.,29,,
163,0.97,1496.127,1518.583,Renters will lose in the long run as small landlords exit the business leaving apartments and I encourage the Council to focus on conversation instead of protecting one side against the other.,29,,

171,0.97,1561.326,1570.001,And the issue of educators becoming homeless and being able to teach our children in an effective way.,31,,
172,0.97,1570.001,1592.023,"As of two years ago, about 10% of the Seattle public schools student population or 54,000 was Unhoused in one way whether that was living out of a vehicle or doubling up or other ways and that has deeply effects on the education of our children.",31,,
173,0.97,1592.023,1610.141,"Additionally, so often we don't--we need to make sure that not only teachers are made to see that their sacrifices that were made during the pandemic were worthwhile and they won't be kicked to the curb after the Eviction moratorium end.",31,,
174,0.97,1610.141,1621.519,And that we take care of contractors that work in education settings and staff and Admin and Jan Janitorial.,31,,

191,0.97,1723.421,1730.128,The coalition has worked with couple Morales' office to develop this legislation.,35,,
192,0.97,1730.128,1736.935,This has left many residents volatile to landlords to circumvent the just cause Eviction.,35,,
193,0.97,1736.935,1746.678,Seattle has the second highest number as a result.,35,,
194,0.97,1746.678,1749.647,We know Councilmember Sawant deeply cares.,35,,
195,0.97,1749.647,1757.422,We ask that this committee as a whole support the recommended passage of Council bill 12057 to the full city council.,35,,

199,0.97,1778.209,1791.723,I'm Sonya Fullnet and as a working mom of two teenagers I support Councilmember Sawant legislation and urge you to support it without delay.,37,,
200,0.97,1791.723,1798.53,It is unconscionable to Evict someone with no justification and especially school children and their family.,37,,
201,0.97,1798.53,1806.104,Seattle has had this just cause protection for tenants on Month- To-Month leases since 190.,37,,
202,0.97,1806.104,1812.443,This has directed the corporate landlords and slum Lords to use every trick to support any loop holes they can find.,37,,
203,0.97,1812.443,1817.282,This doesn't mean if you Repetatur house you can Evict them.,37,,
204,0.97,1817.282,1827.592,You have you have to legitimate reason.,37,,
205,0.97,1827.592,1832.931,Thank you Councilmember Sawant for introducing this necessary bill.,37,,
206,0.97,1832.931,1848.546,I believe that we really need to build a mass movement of Renters to close the Seattle just loophole and fight the Eviction crisis.,37,,

210,0.97,1857.889,1865.563,We know Evictions are traumatic for any person but for children it is amplified.,39,,
211,0.97,1865.563,1869.667,They are being disrupted from education but removed from the community of peers to support them.,39,,
212,0.97,1869.667,1874.973,I want to ask the committee to please support expanding just cause protection for Renters.,39,,
213,0.97,1874.973,1885.783,When I moved I was totally shocked to find out that landlords in Seattle can Evict tenants without any legal proof or reason unless you are renting for a month.,39,,
214,0.97,1885.783,1909.707,This sounds like a common sense policy but we know corporate landlords will lobby because they have the most money to gain and asking everyone to you know protect the community over profit and support children and Representers from Evictions.,39,,
215,0.97,1909.707,1910.008,Thank you.,39,,

231,0.97,1981.479,1988.853,Several of my tenants I have given these Covid rebates on my own and I have been working with them through this whole Covid era.,46,,
232,0.97,1988.853,2019.517,Also it has been puzzling that you seem to in the city of Seattle Council meetings have no housing providers during the draft of your discussions even this meeting there is no Presenters at this meeting from the housing providers or previous meetings and I wish you would include us a little more in the beginning.,46,,
233,0.97,2019.517,2021.152,Don't like the proposals.,46,,
234,0.97,2021.152,2021.619,Thank you very much.,46,,

250,0.97,2099.564,2110.108,With the moratorium coming to an end we need to act quickly to protect vulnerable Renters from retaliatory behaviors from landlords.,50,,
251,0.97,2110.108,2115.279,Renters should not be facing homelessness as a result of loop holes and for no reason.,50,,

256,0.97,2142.874,2150.014,Every day we hear from individuals and families that face arbitrary and unjust Eviction threats.,52,,
257,0.97,2150.014,2165.897,The loophole is especially concerning as it evades the just cause provisions that city has enacted in protection of tenants.,52,,
258,0.97,2165.897,2182.58,Knowing Councilmember Sawant supports and sponsors this legislation and the healthy coalition work together with Councilmember Morales' office to continue showing up to Renters that face significant power imbalances.,52,,

266,0.97,2222.186,2250.681,In fact it was so important during that time that we were actually required to go and bus them from their new location where ever it was if it was outside of the District and bring them back and used to going to the schools they went to because we know stability helps and we have been working for years to get the teachers to live and policeman to live in the districts that they are in so we want to keep everybody together as a family.,54,,
267,0.97,2250.681,2254.418,It Issic pave Rative to keep the kids in the home and not Evict them.,54,,
268,0.97,2254.418,2276.674,As I said this was going on before Covid you can imagine during Eviction time and we need to extend the moratorium or pass the legislation before the moratorium runs out.,54,,

324,0.97,2646.443,2657.588,The thing that is more bothersome there was a building in Pioneer square that is totally Unsif.,67,,
325,0.97,2657.588,2662.96,The affordable housing units are more expensive than newer studios and they still want you to pay utilities separately.,67,,
326,0.97,2662.96,2668.832,Even though the lighting is worse than a jail.,67,,
327,0.97,2668.832,2669.233,Now --,67,,

333,0.97,2708.439,2709.373,Good afternoon.,71,,
334,0.97,2709.373,2724.021,I'm a Renter in D2 and I am calling to ask that this committee recommends passage of the strong rent protection.,71,,
335,0.97,2724.021,2726.123,Cb12057 that was required Stakeholders including Washington cab.,71,,
336,0.97,2726.123,2733.363,We saw the court decision as well supported the policies demonstrating the deep support for the protection and the application.,71,,
337,0.97,2733.363,2745.909,So again I want to thank Councilmember Morales and the office to support Cb120057.,71,,
338,0.97,2745.909,2746.21,Thank you.,71,,
339,0.97,2746.21,2752.583,So our last two speakers are Rene and Kayla.,72,,
340,0.97,2752.583,2761.725,Hello I am Rene Balou and staff attorney with the housing Justice Department as well has Seattle Renter in the Bal ard neighborhood.,73,,
341,0.97,2761.725,2769.5,Calling to express support for Council bill 1257 sponsored by Councilmember Morales and cosponsored by Councilmember Lewis.,73,,
342,0.97,2769.5,2780.844,This bill is a really crucial step in rental problems for Seattle tenants because it would close the lease term nation loophole under the current just cause Eviction ordinance.,73,,
343,0.97,2780.844,2788.452,The loophole currently allows landlords to deny lease renewals through no fault of their own.,73,,
344,0.97,2788.452,2795.225,This loophole runs completely counter to the policy behind the just cause Eviction ordinance.,73,,
345,0.97,2795.225,2802.866,Imagine building a home and expecting the object of lease renewal.,73,,
346,0.97,2802.866,2806.403,Winnings are motivated by racial bias.,73,,
347,0.97,2806.403,2808.939,Landlords should appreciate responsibility by providing someone with a home.,73,,
348,0.97,2808.939,2822.352,I am hearing from landlords today from rental housing is Shockingingly under regulated.,73,,
349,0.97,2822.352,2822.653,Thank you.,73,,
350,0.97,2822.653,2831.428,Our last Speaker is Kayla Nicholson.,74,,
351,0.97,2831.428,2831.962,I am Kayla Nicholson.,75,,
352,0.97,2831.962,2834.665,A Renter in district 5 and working parent.,75,,
353,0.97,2834.665,2844.374,I just want to first Express support for both the pieces of legislation that Councilmember Kshama Sawant has brought.,75,,
354,0.97,2844.374,2853.083,The ban on Evictions of school students and their families and teachers during the school year and also the just cause Eviction legislation.,75,,
355,0.97,2853.083,2881.778,"I just want to thank Councilmember Sawant for hosting this community meeting and for inviting ordinary Renters like myself to be part of this discussion and to weigh in not just on this legislation but over the years the strategy of inviting ordinary Renters and trying to mobilize the community to weigh in and be a part of this has helped us to win countless pieces of rental protection without the types of loop holes that are seen in most cities, right?",75,,
356,0.97,2881.778,2887.351,We have a lot of really precedent legislation as a result of this strategy.,75,,
357,0.97,2887.351,2904.768,"And I, if I remember criminal Councilmember Sawant indicated at the beginning she has offered to cosponsor the legislation from Councilmember Morales and other speakers have mentioned so I am confused, Yeah, she has already offered to cosponsor that.",75,,
358,0.97,2904.768,2904.968,Yeah.,75,,
359,0.97,2904.968,2919.049,I would be interested to hear from Councilmember Morales.,75,,
360,0.97,2919.049,2919.316,Sorry.,76,,
361,0.97,2919.316,2923.82,Please the first speakers I interrupted please send your comments to the committee absolutely always.,76,,
362,0.97,2923.82,2936.5,And I really appreciate everyone that signed up and public comments and I want to confirm what the last speaker was saying.,76,,
363,0.97,2936.5,2956.753,I have offered to cosponsor Councilmember Morales' bill because of course my office supports the just cause loophole and it does no help from my stand point--I have always used my office to build rank and file movement of Renters and workers because that is the only thing that gets it.,76,,
364,0.97,2956.753,2978.442,So in that sense it does not help the Renters movement for there to be division and so absolutely I have offered to cosponsor and Councilmember Morales to respond to that publicly and I will definitely look forward to that.,76,,
365,0.97,2978.442,2989.019,That in the conclusion of public comment the first agenda item begins.,76,,
366,0.97,2989.019,3006.503,We--two Renter rights bill we will hear to explain the legislation and to hear from a community member that is advocates to discuss this project that the legislation addresses and staff from my office will summarize where we are.,76,,
367,0.97,3006.503,3028.558,We have a lot on our plate and I wanted to accommodate everybody on public comment but that did take up quite a while and we have three agenda items so I would really appreciate all Presenters keeping everything efficient.,76,,
368,0.97,3028.558,3046.51,"The first item here in terms of the banning the Evictions of school age children and educators during the school year, we have presentation from Asha Venkataranman and Aly Pennucci and Council central staff on this office.",76,,
369,0.97,3046.51,3054.718,I will have them come in and introduce yourselves for the record and begin when you're ready.,76,,
370,0.97,3054.718,3057.687,Thank you in advance.,76,,
371,0.97,3057.687,3062.726,Good afternoon Councilmember Sawant and Asha Venkataranman and Aly Pennucci.,77,,
372,0.97,3062.726,3066.296,Good afternoon.,78,,
373,0.97,3066.296,3069.733,Asha Venkataranman with central staff.,78,,
374,0.97,3069.733,3074.771,We'll just go ahead and dive into the beginning of the presentation.,79,,
375,0.97,3074.771,3079.676,We are here today to discuss two bills.,79,,
376,0.97,3079.676,3094.825,Council bill 120046 related to Evictions during the school year as well as Council bill 120056 related to fixed term leases and the just cause Eviction ordinance.,79,,
377,0.97,3094.825,3095.258,"Next slide, please.",79,,
378,0.97,3095.258,3100.13,Before--so we will take up the first Council bill.,79,,
379,0.97,3100.13,3104.367,120046 that relates to the school year Evictions.,79,,
380,0.97,3104.367,3122.152,"However, before getting into describing what that bill does, I thought we would just start with describing generally what the just cause Eviction ordinance does but I will keep it brief because Councilmember Sawant has done this and there have been previous presentations.",79,,
381,0.97,3122.152,3149.713,Generally speaking the just cause Eviction ordinance requires landlords afternoon property managers to state one of the approved reasons list 3RD inviting the ordinance to proceed with Eviction and that includes noticing requirements to tenants prior to filing unlawful Detainer to take tenant to court and provides a defense to Evictions for unlawful Detainer.,79,,
382,0.97,3149.713,3163.86,It doesn't prohibit the landlord from proceeding with issuing the notice and taking a tenant to court but offers a tenant a defense in those proceedings which their attorney or they themselves can raise before the judge.,79,,
383,0.97,3163.86,3190.053,Here on this slide this is a high level described what the defenses are including requiring a defense would be if it would result in a tenant having to vacant between December 1ST and March 1 applying to the public health emergency.,79,,
384,0.97,3190.053,3196.393,With that we will move into describing Council bill 120046.,79,,
385,0.97,3196.393,3212.075,This bill would amend the just cause Eviction ordinance to provide a defense for Eviction that would occur during the school year if any member of the household is under 18 and enrolled in school as the pair rest or Guardian of such a person or is a school employee.,79,,
386,0.97,3212.075,3219.716,So I will just pause here for a minute to say this is where I was describing it offers a defense.,79,,
387,0.97,3219.716,3233.363,It doesn't prohibit the landlord from initiating Eviction proceedings but it does offer a defense for the tenant when they are in court.,79,,
388,0.97,3233.363,3236.233,"Next slide, please.",79,,
389,0.97,3236.233,3240.303,Definitions and who it will apply to.,79,,
390,0.97,3240.303,3248.712,As I have described it covers any household with a child or student.,79,,
391,0.97,3248.712,3253.984,Anybody under 18 or currently enrolled in school.,79,,
392,0.97,3253.984,3257.087,Definition of educator is broader than some people understood.,79,,
393,0.97,3257.087,3271.134,"It includes employees or contractors of school, governing body and execute teachers and para professionals and administrators and the list goes on here on the slide.",79,,
394,0.97,3271.134,3287.117,"But it is a broad definition of anyone that is supporting the school, the educators and the students in being able to succeed in that environment.",79,,
395,0.97,3287.117,3289.352,"Next slide, please.",79,,
396,0.97,3289.352,3298.762,And then in terms of school this applies to any early childhood education and assistance program.,79,,
397,0.97,3298.762,3309.139,Head start facilities and private and public institutions that provide education for all grades or age groups up to and including 12th grade.,79,,
398,0.97,3309.139,3315.011,The school year is tied to the academic year set by the Seattle school district.,79,,
399,0.97,3315.011,3325.789,That is at a high level and the amendment for the just cause Eviction ordinance would do in Council bill 120046.,79,,
400,0.97,3325.789,3333.496,We had intended to keep this brief and with the chair's direct we don't have a lot more to add but happy to answer questions.,79,,
401,0.97,3333.496,3356.853,I'll just note that the next step here as Councilmember Sawant had described we are happy to work with committee members for consideration at the next committee meeting where I think the chair intends to take up additional discussion and potential vote at that meeting.,79,,
402,0.97,3356.853,3358.922,Thank you.,80,,
403,0.97,3358.922,3368.798,I'm sure there are questions to be directed to you all Asha and Aly.,80,,
404,0.97,3368.798,3374.938,I want to invite the community panel because I know that several of them.,80,,
405,0.97,3374.938,3378.475,Two or three of them have time constraints.,80,,
406,0.97,3378.475,3397.06,I wanted to make sure that we call on them so we--to begin with we have the community members speaking to ban school--ban the Evictions of schools.,80,,
407,0.97,3397.06,3397.36,I'm sorry.,80,,
408,0.97,3397.36,3400.53,I have a mouthful.,80,,
409,0.97,3400.53,3406.87,Ban the Evictions of school children and educators doing the school year bill.,80,,
410,0.97,3406.87,3412.375,So I want to start with matt male and Julissa Sanchez and Ariana Laureano.,80,,
411,0.97,3412.375,3425.989,I'm just reading the names so there is not time wasted in awkwardness and matt Maley is an educator taking time out of his workday and school hours to come here.,80,,
412,0.97,3425.989,3429.893,I wanted to start there very quickly.,80,,
413,0.97,3429.893,3438.334,Welcome and for the record introduce yourself with a sentence or two and do your present taking and we will next have Julissa Sanchez.,80,,
414,0.97,3438.334,3439.135,Good afternoon.,81,,
415,0.97,3439.135,3448.478,As stated my name is Matthew Maley and substitute teacher in Seattle public schools and a member of Seattle indicating Association.,81,,
416,0.97,3448.478,3451.581,I also rent and work in district three of Seattle.,81,,
417,0.97,3451.581,3461.825,I would like to start by thanking the office of Councilmember Sawant for bringing these important pieces of legislation forward.,81,,
418,0.97,3461.825,3476.573,I'm speaking mostly to the Eviction protection for school age students but I support a United movement for the strongest possible just cause protection for Renters.,81,,
419,0.97,3476.573,3484.614,"Passing Eviction protections for students, educators and families of school age students would have immediate impact and positive on students and working families.",81,,
420,0.97,3484.614,3485.448,As is already mentioned.,81,,
421,0.97,3485.448,3497.427,I am proud to say that I voted for the resolution that is put forward in front of sea and my Union and passed in support of this Eviction protection.,81,,
422,0.97,3497.427,3510.874,The lack of quality affordable housing is not a new challenge to students and their families but exacerbated by issues of the pants and remote learning and lag of access to adequate technology and high speed Internet.,81,,
423,0.97,3510.874,3521.818,Before the pandemic upwards of 20 to 30% of students in a given school might be homeless qualifying for the Federal program and referred to other Statistics already today.,81,,
424,0.97,3521.818,3544.173,"On top that have, students that have returned In-Person classes face transportation issues as we have heard from the teamsters local representing bus drivers and that is Instuff bus drivers and lack of traps it for many students that need it because their parents can't afford to take them to and from school in the middle of the day.",81,,
425,0.97,3544.173,3551.681,This is why I support implementing protection for educators and family and school age children like the Council bill being considered today.,81,,
426,0.97,3551.681,3559.022,I will urge all Councilmembers to vote yes as they send it to full council.,81,,
427,0.97,3559.022,3564.894,The problems of housing instability are real and devastating for families.,81,,
428,0.97,3564.894,3581.878,There are solutions and I want to thank Councilmember Sawant for her office's leadership and other recent victories like winning Eviction defense for Renters being brought to court.,81,,
429,0.97,3581.878,3615.144,Finally like we know the impacts of the pandemic is immense and won't speak to the loophole fully but as a Renter I have lived in five different housing situations and my eight years in Seattle and at least two of them are at the end of my fixed term lease for no good reason other than the landlord did not want to let us fill an empty room and the second time because my landlord planned to turn it into an Airbnb that we have heard in the public comment.,81,,
430,0.97,3615.144,3616.879,I cab stay on long.,81,,
431,0.97,3616.879,3639.836,I'm in my break so thank you so much to Councilmember Sawant for her leadership on these bills and I urge all city council members to support the bills and for the movement of Renters and working people in the city of Seattle.,81,,
432,0.97,3639.836,3640.403,Thank you very much.,81,,
433,0.97,3640.403,3642.972,"Thank you, matt.",82,,
434,0.97,3642.972,3649.245,Really appreciate you taking time out of your workday as an educator.,82,,
435,0.97,3649.245,3660.89,"If you can stick around for as long as possible, please do because I know there will be questions or comments.",82,,
436,0.97,3660.89,3670.466,And I know I have questions and the next Speaker is Julissa Sanchez followed by Ariana Laureano.,82,,
437,0.97,3670.466,3678.274,If you all--Justlike matt wanted to make comments on the just bill please go ahead.,82,,
438,0.97,3678.274,3680.943,That's totally fine.,82,,
439,0.97,3680.943,3682.011,Go ahead Julissa Sanchez.,82,,
440,0.97,3682.011,3682.945,Thank you.,83,,
441,0.97,3682.945,3685.748,[speaking Spanish],83,,
442,0.97,3685.748,3686.182,Good afternoon.,84,,
443,0.97,3686.182,3695.258,I'm Julissa Sanchez a community Organizer and tenants rights advocate with the Union of Washington state.,84,,
444,0.97,3695.258,3722.185,"As a tenants Union representative and firm believer that housing is a fundamental human right and, therefore, a child's right and as an educator, mother and human that has lived through displace many especially the one we know in the central district in early 2000S, I can assure you that Evictions and displace many ruin life.",84,,
445,0.97,3722.185,3724.554,And ruin community and community connections.,84,,
446,0.97,3724.554,3738.334,I work with the Latinos and documented community and I want to focus on their experiences in being displaced.,84,,
447,0.97,3738.334,3756.886,As they have already came from a totally different country and migrated here and the community and the home here and for Undocumented children to be displaced again and a country where they are recreating their lives.,84,,
448,0.97,3756.886,3780.643,And while in school while learning English and learning a new language and culture and new--forming their own identity within the country and because the pandemic has affected the Undocumented and Latino community and really devastating ways.,84,,
449,0.97,3780.643,3797.96,"To find yourself as a child being evicted and not understanding what that process is like and why that process exists and why we allow that to happen to children and their families or anyone, really, right?",84,,
450,0.97,3797.96,3817.38,"But as a child how do parents explain to children that they are being evicted and they will no longer be in their school and the world that they have created and the space that they are trying to grow and become citizens of the world, right?",84,,
451,0.97,3817.38,3832.562,Children have endured so much under the pandemic and have demonstrated to us adults and to our society how incredible we are.,84,,
452,0.97,3832.562,3844.941,"You know, my son, my son has had a hard time staying on top of assignments and staying on top of homework during Online learning.",84,,
453,0.97,3844.941,3847.41,Because he doesn't have the connection to his friends.,84,,
454,0.97,3847.41,3855.151,He doesn't have the connection to his community at school.,84,,
455,0.97,3855.151,3865.761,"Now imagine evicted during this process while you are trying to go back to the normal way of life, right?",84,,
456,0.97,3865.761,3893.522,"So have children have already showed up resilience we need to show up for our children and need to protect them and keep them in their homes and keep them safe especially black, Brown, Undocumented children that proportionately suffer from housing Injustifieds and witnessing their peers being killed at the hands of police.",84,,
457,0.97,3893.522,3901.664,And we must pass this legislation to make children and their families feel safe and protect children and their families from homelessness.,84,,
458,0.97,3901.664,3909.005,"Having a stable home supports children's mental, social health and their future.",84,,
459,0.97,3909.005,3917.413,I want to thank you Councilmember Sawant for putting this bill and putting children and families first.,84,,

463,0.97,3934.163,3934.931,That is valuable.,85,,
464,0.97,3934.931,3938.734,We have Ariana Laureano next.,85,,

469,0.97,3948.844,3950.913,So Evictions are breaking up our community.,86,,
470,0.97,3950.913,3955.051,As we heard here today we have roughly 1200 Evictions per year.,86,,
471,0.97,3955.051,3962.358,90 Persian of which result in homelessness with over 52% of tenants having one child.,86,,
472,0.97,3962.358,3979.041,We have one in 14 children experiencing homelessness during their education.,86,,
473,0.97,3979.041,3979.742,Sorry.,86,,
474,0.97,3979.742,3982.978,My computer just quit.,86,,
475,0.97,3982.978,3983.212,"Oh, my.",86,,
476,0.97,3983.212,3984.58,I am so sorry.,86,,
477,0.97,3984.58,3986.682,My computer just completely failed on me.,86,,
478,0.97,3986.682,3987.45,I don't know what happened.,86,,
479,0.97,3987.45,3990.186,"Don't you worry at all, Ariana Laureano.",87,,
480,0.97,3990.186,3991.253,This happens to all of us.,87,,
481,0.97,3991.253,3998.728,How about I go to the next panel and then we come back to you.,87,,
482,0.97,3998.728,4001.063,Is that okay?,87,,
483,0.97,4001.063,4004.433,Yes.,88,,
484,0.97,4004.433,4005.334,Thank you.,88,,
485,0.97,4005.334,4007.236,Of course.,89,,
486,0.97,4007.236,4017.046,"We have Shirley Henderson that is a small business owner and Renner, go ahead Shirley.",89,,
487,0.97,4017.046,4023.386,As I call applies say one sentence and go ahead.,89,,
488,0.97,4023.386,4027.49,Thank you so much.,90,,
489,0.97,4027.49,4037.933,I am Shirley Henderson and I'm here today as a Renter and small business opener to support Councilmember Sawant's legislation.,90,,
490,0.97,4037.933,4042.138,We will be speaking specifically on closing the loophole in Seattle's just cause ordinance.,90,,
491,0.97,4042.138,4045.908,I have had my own experience with unjust Evictions.,90,,
492,0.97,4045.908,4067.93,After years of managing an apartment building on Capitol Hill my partner and I were told that management company was no longer going to have on site managers so after caring for the building and the tenants for six years we were given two weeks right before Christmas to find a new place because the company wanted us out before the new year.,90,,
493,0.97,4067.93,4072.334,"It was not an Eviction in a technical sense, right?",90,,
494,0.97,4072.334,4075.137,We were still forced to leave at short notice.,90,,
495,0.97,4075.137,4089.585,We had been managing the apartment building so we could's in order to live near our place of business and managing the apartment building was also a no small part the reason we could afford to open a small business in Seattle in the first place.,90,,
496,0.97,4089.585,4104.066,Trying to find a new home in the crazy expensive rental market during the holidays was horrific and furthered to move further from our business and community.,90,,
497,0.97,4104.066,4128.023,While closing the loophole may not have protected my partner and I from getting evicted I can relate to folk that have been evicted without cause that are then left struggling to find a new home when they don't have the time or the money for deposits on top of having the emotional stress of just being evicted.,90,,
498,0.97,4128.023,4134.663,So many tenants are evicted through the loophole in Seattle's laws to prevent Evictions without a justifiable reason.,90,,
499,0.97,4134.663,4152.681,As others have talked about it on average Seattle landlords Evict about 1200 tenants every year according to court records and this loophole is thoroughly exploited by corporate landlords as slum Lords as I have experienced and witnessed as being a manager.,90,,
500,0.97,4152.681,4167.997,"And it is about to become a bigger danger because as others have talked about the Washington state Legislature, Democrats and Republicans alike have just voted to end the statewide Eviction moratorium on June 30th of this year.",90,,
501,0.97,4167.997,4170.332,And that's just around the corner.,90,,
502,0.97,4170.332,4178.941,And we know that many tenants are still struggling economically as a result of Covid and the Captainist recession.,90,,
503,0.97,4178.941,4191.654,Without the just cause protection extended prior to June 30th we can see landlords start to file Eviction notices against team lease debt ants as they expire in July.,90,,
504,0.97,4191.654,4205.0,Nationally the pandemic and Eviction moratorium have not stopped corporate landlords Evictions we know the corporate landlords will do the bulk of the Evicting.,90,,
505,0.97,4205.0,4211.64,I can tell you that this affects small businesses too.,90,,
506,0.97,4211.64,4219.748,Whether it is from struggling Renters and employees that are at the mercy of landlords when the lease term is up and forced on them.,90,,
507,0.97,4219.748,4223.652,The employees from small businesses are absolutely struggling Renters.,90,,
508,0.97,4223.652,4230.125,As a majority of the service industry jobs ended to Covid because of closures.,90,,
509,0.97,4230.125,4236.198,It is time to we close the loophole and have just cause protection from Evictions.,90,,
510,0.97,4236.198,4245.641,I am joining Councilmember Sawant's office and the rights activists to fight for the strongest possible protection for Renters getting unjustly evicted.,90,,
511,0.97,4245.641,4283.212,It is a possible that Morales is working on legislation and I'm excited about the possibility of Morales working together with Councilmember Sawant's office for just cause Evictions as there is more strength in working United together and also Councilmember Sawant's office is the most successful fighter for Renters protections and housing justice because of her office use of movement with Renters and workers to empower them and get organized and that is exactly what we need and what is most important to win the strongest possible legislation without loop holes.,90,,
512,0.97,4283.212,4295.057,I want to thank everyone here today and Councilmember Sawant's office for working on this important legislation.,90,,
513,0.97,4295.057,4296.925,"Thank you, Sharely.",91,,
514,0.97,4296.925,4301.664,I will try to bring in the speakers.,91,,
515,0.97,4301.664,4308.47,I know from what we have been informed are short on time because they have to go to their job and family.,91,,
516,0.97,4308.47,4315.177,I want to call on Anna Maria that is a Renter.,91,,
517,0.97,4315.177,4325.854,And Maria if you are here can you give an introduction for yourself and go ahead with your comments.,91,,
518,0.97,4325.854,4329.291,Good afternoon.,92,,
519,0.97,4329.291,4335.998,I'm Anna Maria and arts educator and artist and volunteer and Renter out of West Seattle.,92,,
520,0.97,4335.998,4347.81,From 2011 to 2014 my partner and I lived in lower queen Ann in an apartment building relatively small with 13 units privately owned.,92,,
521,0.97,4347.81,4353.248,We had multi generational families and young professionals and young people in the building.,92,,
522,0.97,4353.248,4360.823,Our previous landlord when he died his building was sold to a corporation.,92,,
523,0.97,4360.823,4365.127,There is no effort or help to make sure that it would get renewed.,92,,
524,0.97,4365.127,4372.401,They said things were going to change and they changed the rules around pets.,92,,
525,0.97,4372.401,4379.341,Half of my neighbors got cats and dogs and in the spring of 2014 we went to a family wedding.,92,,
526,0.97,4379.341,4388.617,When we came back we found in our mailbox a letter from from corporate landlords.,92,,
527,0.97,4388.617,4394.289,They have waited for the last lease to lapse and it changed.,92,,
528,0.97,4394.289,4396.992,All of our rents went up 30%.,92,,
529,0.97,4396.992,4417.346,We thought this was illegal being from Southern California I am not aware of unjust tis of corporate Evictions but I thought this was too much for ceiling and so long as tenants have a 60 day notice that corporate landlords can raise is as much as they want.,92,,
530,0.97,4417.346,4429.825,"I want to talk about comments said earlier we have 64 days, that means in four days there will be corporate landlords sending out notices raising rents over 30%.",92,,
531,0.97,4429.825,4433.328,We had some whose rent wept up as far as 43%.,92,,
532,0.97,4433.328,4446.942,There is absolutely no updates to make the building more disability accessible or anything else beyond slapping a new coat of paint to justify all of the RAISES of our rent.,92,,
533,0.97,4446.942,4457.486,If you wanted to stay Month-To- month until you found a better place you had to agree and they decided to ban all pets from the building after allowing us there including those that had gold fish.,92,,
534,0.97,4457.486,4462.891,All of us that had just gotten animals had to move out of the building regardless.,92,,
535,0.97,4462.891,4464.626,The entire building was a ghost town in three week.,92,,
536,0.97,4464.626,4468.664,Everyone was running around stressed and some people were unable to find a place to live.,92,,
537,0.97,4468.664,4474.703,Moving out of Seattle or moving into other housing with friends or family.,92,,
538,0.97,4474.703,4477.306,One couple in our building was 8 months pregnant.,92,,
539,0.97,4477.306,4480.642,They had no resources to call a moving company.,92,,
540,0.97,4480.642,4485.581,I remember seeing her struggling carrying Mattress to the moving Van.,92,,
541,0.97,4485.581,4493.222,We left the building within less than three weeks and the building manager was crying every single day we saw her.,92,,
542,0.97,4493.222,4501.697,The only way we found the apartment because I at the time had a job that would allow me to be flexible with my time so I could find a home.,92,,
543,0.97,4501.697,4508.67,My partner was in the same position and not afforded anytime off to look at the places where we wanted to live.,92,,
544,0.97,4508.67,4529.892,Many neighbors were not in the same position and finding a home suddenly when you don't have a Safing meant they had to take time off work and felt cruel that this new burden of losing money to find a new place to put more money into it was being put on them.,92,,
545,0.97,4529.892,4535.43,I now in West Seattle and haven't discussed that sense of corporate Landowner.,92,,
546,0.97,4535.43,4542.337,I spent a year be my current rental being told to move and that the House will be torn down and turned into condos for a year.,92,,
547,0.97,4542.337,4553.882,My House mates and I had to schedule our work around city inspectors and construction companies and consultants working to come out to look at our home to get us evicted out of their convenience.,92,,
548,0.97,4553.882,4566.261,I had to schedule my work for me to apparently for people to come in and expect whether the soil was good enough for condos to turn us out of our own home.,92,,
549,0.97,4566.261,4577.239,This does not have a sense of security in one's housing Especally with no notice and you come home with a giant sign outside your apartment building saying it will be torn down.,92,,
550,0.97,4577.239,4580.776,I pay my rent and Tacks and vote and volunteer and live here.,92,,
551,0.97,4580.776,4589.217,I wonder again and again when this happens to me why is the status quo is that we allow companies to push around Renters.,92,,
552,0.97,4589.217,4602.931,I am sharing my experience as a mixed race light skin La Latino I know there is systemic racism.,92,,
553,0.97,4602.931,4615.277,"This creates further harm to our fellow citizens black indigenous, Pacific Islander and other Latino people and immigrants Undocumented or not and Trans.",92,,
554,0.97,4615.277,4625.821,Renters are a significant portion of Seattle and we deserve rent control to being pushed in the cycle of House cost.,92,,
555,0.97,4625.821,4630.926,We are your teachers and your Baristas and restaurant employees.,92,,
556,0.97,4630.926,4634.997,We are your University employees and your essential workers.,92,,
557,0.97,4634.997,4638.967,Holding you and all of us together during this time.,92,,
558,0.97,4638.967,4641.536,We deserve housing protection and rent control.,92,,
559,0.97,4641.536,4656.785,Thank you so much for your time.,92,,
560,0.97,4656.785,4669.431,Thank you so much Maria as you pointed out the workers are the vast majority of Renters.,93,,
561,0.97,4669.431,4670.098,That is important.,93,,
562,0.97,4670.098,4674.336,Next we have--sorry.,93,,
563,0.97,4674.336,4676.972,I will let dare introduce herself.,93,,
564,0.97,4676.972,4680.509,I am Perry Anderson with the tenants Union of Washington state.,94,,
565,0.97,4680.509,4689.451,I'm the director of our Spokane office but I also lead our statewide organization and our policy work.,94,,
566,0.97,4689.451,4717.212,And I was asked to previously explain what happened at the state lawyer if everybody kept saying just cause passed the state Legislature and causes the Seattle loophole that by the way was the biggest barrier getting it passed through because the landlords were Adam that they wanted to keep the loophole intact.,94,,
567,0.97,4717.212,4723.351,When Legislatre is enacted there is compromise from both sides and amendments were taken on this amendment.,94,,
568,0.97,4723.351,4725.253,I mean on this bill.,94,,
569,0.97,4725.253,4738.3,And the one amendment that I think probably impacts Seattle tenants is the Probationary period that they put on fixed term leases.,94,,
570,0.97,4738.3,4780.342,"So the bill that just passed in Olympia House bill 1236 sponsored--representative Nicole Makraoe and it does provide just case and end the no cause notices for Month-To- month Renters in the state that is used as statewide organization, we hear from tenants all across the state who still gets 20 day notices and have to move within 20 days and in the city of Spokane where the vacancy rate is at one percent or 1.1% that means that tenants have no where to go when they get the 20 day notices.",94,,
571,0.97,4780.342,4789.918,For that reason the bill was very helpful and we are excited that it passed.,94,,
572,0.97,4789.918,4796.992,But the Probationary period may can troublesome for Seattle Renters and we had trouble with that.,94,,
573,0.97,4796.992,4813.341,"What it means when House bill 1236 is signed into law, landlords can elect to offer per petal Probationary period so that is the part that I don't like.",94,,
574,0.97,4813.341,4838.2,"What it does allow a landlord to do if they first offer a one- year lease to a tenant, then for that first year they can issue a 60 no cause notice to notify the tenant that their lease is not being renewed and after the term lease expires.",94,,
575,0.97,4838.2,4852.147,So that way there will still be no cause Evictions in Seattle if a tenant can't move to within 60 days of preceding that notice.,94,,
576,0.97,4852.147,4873.635,If the landlord decides to renew the lease at the end of that Probationary period they can offer to a six month to one year lease and continue perpetually at the end of that period to offer 6 0-Day notice of no cause that would end that term lease.,94,,
577,0.97,4873.635,4884.613,Or it would convert automatically into a Month-To- month lease or month-to-month agreement and for just cause Eviction.,94,,
578,0.97,4884.613,4900.128,If you are a month-to-month tenant you are at risk of receiving a 60 day month increase notice and we know in Spokane we are seeing 60% rent increase notices and they are drastic.,94,,
579,0.97,4900.128,4906.468,So that is where the bill is right now.,94,,
580,0.97,4906.468,4927.055,If you were to close the hole it would mean to end that period and the understanding is Barian have ordinances that never included Probationary period so it was cooked up at the state Legislature.,94,,
581,0.97,4927.055,4935.563,Other cities don't have a Probationary period and that's the one--the drawback that impacts and what will happen in Seattle.,94,,
582,0.97,4935.563,4944.906,"You will now, I guess we will all have the same thing in the state so we will all have that loophole.",94,,
583,0.97,4944.906,4949.811,We don't know how sophisticated landlords are outside of Seattle and if they will issue that notice.,94,,
584,0.97,4949.811,4967.262,I am hoping a lot of them will forget because if they don't issue that 60 day notice that term lease would either convert to month-to-month that the ten and the would have just cause or the landlord would have the offer to renew the lease.,94,,
585,0.97,4967.262,4968.33,So I hope I explained that.,94,,
586,0.97,4968.33,4971.933,"Thank you, Terry and we will have impress for you.",95,,
587,0.97,4971.933,4972.934,I know Councilmembers will do so.,95,,
588,0.97,4972.934,4974.803,Are you able to stay for a bit?,95,,
589,0.97,4974.803,4975.036,Yes.,96,,
590,0.97,4975.036,4980.608,I can stay for a little bit.,96,,
591,0.97,4980.608,4980.975,Thank you.,97,,
592,0.97,4980.975,4990.518,I am requesting that so we can have speakers that are in a rush to go to their day job.,97,,
593,0.97,4990.518,4992.721,I believe Ariana Laureano's computer is fixed.,97,,
594,0.97,4992.721,4994.356,Did you want to go ahead.,97,,
595,0.97,4994.356,4994.589,Yes.,98,,
596,0.97,4994.589,4996.358,We can try this again.,98,,
597,0.97,4996.358,4996.958,Sorry about that.,98,,
598,0.97,4996.958,5009.704,So as we heard we have roughly 1200 Evictions per year and with over 52% of tenants having children we have one in 14 children experiencing homelessness during their education and development.,98,,
599,0.97,5009.704,5016.077,This doubles the chance of dropping out for at least 561 children per year.,98,,
600,0.97,5016.077,5025.353,When the child is not experiencing the trauma of housing insecurity often they are witnessing that trauma occur to a member community.,98,,
601,0.97,5025.353,5027.856,Friends disappearing and neighbors no longer there.,98,,
602,0.97,5027.856,5032.427,Even if the Evictions don't hit their families it hits friend.,98,,
603,0.97,5032.427,5035.93,These harm the kids during the% development and damage the sense of community.,98,,
604,0.97,5035.93,5041.002,I may not have drawn up in Seattle but this problem permeates our nation.,98,,
605,0.97,5041.002,5049.411,I moved almost every year when I was a kid because I was raised by a single mother and impacts of that Havic Quod through my life.,98,,
606,0.97,5049.411,5053.148,Most of my friends move every year.,98,,
607,0.97,5053.148,5076.571,"We need to live for a stable housing situation for Renters, one that your neighbors don't constantly change and one where children can't lose friends to Evictions and it is my belief that Evictions and the rental markets of large contributors to the destruction of community and that leads to a loophole.",98,,
608,0.97,5076.571,5082.777,The loophole and just case impacts my household community directly.,98,,
609,0.97,5082.777,5088.983,Throughout the pandemic we fell.,98,,
610,0.97,5088.983,5099.294,Our lease expired in the pandemic and even though we are caught up we will face an Eviction once the moratorium is lifted.,98,,
611,0.97,5099.294,5106.0,Our landlord said we should be grateful he did not apply fees for the months that we have been month-to-month.,98,,
612,0.97,5106.0,5106.668,Throughout the pandemic.,98,,
613,0.97,5106.668,5115.343,My building is at 50% capacity and of the four tenants remaining two of us have expired leases and will not be protected by just cause.,98,,
614,0.97,5115.343,5127.355,My neighbor is a single mother and she fears Eviction not because she is behind on rent but because she has complained about the living conditions and her lease expired.,98,,
615,0.97,5127.355,5137.732,My landlord is a Slumlord that keeps unit is in bad condition and leases them six to eight months so he can Evict as often as he needs without just cause.,98,,
616,0.97,5137.732,5149.41,I wanted to thank Councilmember Morales and Sawant for working together to pave the way towards a brighter future for tenants and I believe these bills can contribute towards that.,98,,
617,0.97,5149.41,5149.711,Thank you.,98,,
618,0.97,5149.711,5151.212,Thank you Ariana Laureano.,99,,
619,0.97,5151.212,5168.83,And I think Ariana Laureano you made a note of a very important point that is the case of Renters getting Eviction notices and not having leases renewed as a way of retaliating against them for complaining about substandard conditions.,99,,
620,0.97,5168.83,5170.365,We hear about that all the time.,99,,
621,0.97,5170.365,5186.014,I don't have specific numbers off of the top of my head but Anecdotally what we hear from Renters and they are afraid to say anything.,99,,
622,0.97,5186.014,5188.216,Slumlords are the most notorious for that.,99,,
623,0.97,5188.216,5200.595,I appreciate you pointing that out.,99,,
624,0.97,5200.595,5207.802,Next we have Jordan Vanno ass and let people know you are speaking on behalf of your brother.,99,,
625,0.97,5207.802,5217.445,"Go ahead and explain that, Jordan.",99,,
626,0.97,5217.445,5218.68,You are muted.,100,,
627,0.97,5218.68,5220.882,Sorry.,101,,
628,0.97,5220.882,5221.649,Good afternoon.,101,,
629,0.97,5221.649,5232.927,"My name is Jordan Vannoast and I am speaking on behalf of my older brother, Henry that has mental illness and faces Eviction for no justifiable cause.",101,,
630,0.97,5232.927,5245.273,"The landlord has merely stated that he wants the space for his business partner, I in violated my brother to be here today but due to the impact of the stress on his emotional health he has understandably declined.",101,,
631,0.97,5245.273,5251.379,I believe that Henry is someone that lives with mental illness is being targeted due to his condition.,101,,
632,0.97,5251.379,5269.664,The building he lives in has four units and the landlord claims he has contacted all the tenants though clearly he has identified Henry as a candidate for Eviction dispute the assertion he is seeking other options to assure no disruption to current tenants Unquote.,101,,
633,0.97,5269.664,5279.741,"I requested to meet with him on zoom or by phone and discuss options including renegotiating the lease but his answers have been short, evasive and noncommittal.",101,,
634,0.97,5279.741,5285.013,Henry has lived at his apartment building longer than any of the other tenants for eight years.,101,,
635,0.97,5285.013,5290.284,The represent has never been late.,101,,
636,0.97,5290.284,5296.924,Henry was diagnosed with Schizophrenia at age 18 and has has emotional trauma in his life.,101,,
637,0.97,5296.924,5307.869,Difficult for a person that has not experienced mental illness to comprehend the depth of this that occurs from mainstream society.,101,,
638,0.97,5307.869,5320.748,At age 64 he is beginning to heal his past and feel a sense of dignity and personal E Mpowerment.,101,,
639,0.97,5320.748,5334.729,He has donate the paints and the cafeteria at Swedish Ballard has his paintings hanging.,101,,
640,0.97,5334.729,5338.299,He lives close by and walks over to share a meal.,101,,
641,0.97,5338.299,5354.449,If evicted it will be difficult to find anything affordable within a five mile radius and someone with mental illness he will be plunged into isolation.,101,,
642,0.97,5354.449,5361.355,Stable housing is essential is for everybody and especially with mental illness.,101,,
643,0.97,5361.355,5376.938,How many of these people lack family resources are evicted without just cause and end up on the street causing their mental illness and emotional well-being to deteriorate and creating suffering and expense for the community as a whole.,101,,
644,0.97,5376.938,5382.043,Landlords should not be able to treat human beings like mere numbers in a business equation.,101,,
645,0.97,5382.043,5385.046,It is inhumane and unjust and doesn't need to be this way.,101,,
646,0.97,5385.046,5396.39,The Covid pandemic has given us an opportunity to build a compassionate world where no one gets left behind.,101,,
647,0.97,5396.39,5397.825,We are all connected.,101,,
648,0.97,5397.825,5407.635,It is ironic when landlords use legal authority and power to treat another human being like they are a piece of property to own or discard as it suits their bottom line.,101,,
649,0.97,5407.635,5418.146,We are no longer living in medieval times and human civil I Zation is facing this.,101,,
650,0.97,5418.146,5420.548,It is time to acknowledge our in Ter dependence.,101,,
651,0.97,5420.548,5436.664,If one person is not safe we are all affected and unless we can build a world based on compassion and inequity there is no hope for the climate emergency or any of the social and ecological or crisis that we face.,101,,
652,0.97,5436.664,5443.604,Councilmembers please work together to advance legislation closing the just cause Lophole in term leases for tenants.,101,,
653,0.97,5443.604,5445.139,Thank you for your time.,101,,
654,0.97,5445.139,5455.616,"Thank you, Jordan and I wanted to point out some members of the public are only listening on the phone.",102,,
655,0.97,5455.616,5491.552,Those of you watching will have good fortune to see the paintings of Jordan's brother and people can enjoy them.,102,,
656,0.97,5491.552,5493.254,Go ahead Jacob.,102,,
657,0.97,5493.254,5493.521,Hi.,103,,
658,0.97,5493.521,5499.493,Thank you so much for having me.,103,,
659,0.97,5499.493,5506.2,My name is Jacob sheer and I want to thank Councilmember Sawant.,103,,
660,0.97,5506.2,5510.071,Thank you for making a place where Renters and working people have a chance to live.,103,,
661,0.97,5510.071,5520.381,And thank you to the Renters and advocates that have fought for crucial victories to legal Council and the Eviction moratorium and extensions.,103,,
662,0.97,5520.381,5530.925,And also want to say thank you to the stay healthy coalition and working with Councilmember Morales' office that I'm proud to be a part of.,103,,
663,0.97,5530.925,5539.233,I live in Wallingford in district four and member of the boat workers on Capitol Hill.,103,,
664,0.97,5539.233,5546.574,And I want to talk today about the importance of just cause for Renters.,103,,
665,0.97,5546.574,5552.179,I myself am a term Renter and I traditionally signed one year leases where I live in Wallingford.,103,,
666,0.97,5552.179,5553.748,I love my apartment.,103,,
667,0.97,5553.748,5558.219,I have lived here for almost seven years.,103,,
668,0.97,5558.219,5571.132,I probably have been considered a long-term Renter and joke about living here for the rest of my life and despite years of paying rent on time I have the good fortune to have a pretty kind Landlor.,103,,
669,0.97,5571.132,5580.942,There does always exist that sense of uncertainty every August when my lease is up when I know there's the possibility that I can have my home taken away from me.,103,,
670,0.97,5580.942,5584.979,So people deserve just cause in every area of economic life.,103,,
671,0.97,5584.979,5608.636,And as we have been Bargainng for over the past year securing just cause calls for a primary objective for our fellow workers and being protected for just cause on the job means that workers can lose their jobs due to the whims of criteria and it is a vital step towards democracy.,103,,
672,0.97,5608.636,5619.58,When workers know that the boss can fire them it produces a power imbalance and holding management accountable and rewarding.,103,,
673,0.97,5619.58,5631.792,We have seen first hand the impact of not having just cause and I have had co-workers be fired without evidence.,103,,
674,0.97,5631.792,5646.207,Subject to the whims of management without any consideration to the people contributing to our workplace.,103,,
675,0.97,5646.807,5655.85,It is clear how a Nal La GOS of workers being fired.,103,,
676,0.97,5655.85,5675.036,Causing the just term loophole and fellow workers we know that majority of Renters are term Renters and vital step towards where Renters live and thank you so much.,103,,
677,0.97,5675.036,5697.692,Thank you Jacob and for pointing out the a Nal La analogous situation of workers to get organized and Renters as well so bosses don't exploit them and to divide against corporate landlords.,104,,
678,0.97,5697.692,5702.063,Loophole is an example of that.,104,,
679,0.97,5702.063,5708.002,Next we have Sharon Crawlly.,104,,
680,0.97,5708.002,5708.269,Go ahead.,104,,
681,0.97,5708.269,5708.502,Hi.,105,,
682,0.97,5708.502,5711.038,I'm Sharon Crawly.,105,,
683,0.97,5711.038,5730.024,I am here as a Renter in Seattle's district 6. a member of the ceiling's Renter's Commission and member and Organizer of UAW local 4121 that my background--we are in bargaining right now.,105,,
684,0.97,5730.024,5735.863,So our Union is made up of 6000 academic workers in Washington.,105,,
685,0.97,5735.863,5749.777,We not only make the University of Washington run but we are doing the majority of research on Life-Saving measures to deal with Covid and other kinds of illnesses.,105,,
686,0.97,5749.777,5760.788,Yeah so I am here to speak in strong support of both pieces of legislation but will speak on just cause Eviction project.,105,,
687,0.97,5760.788,5767.895,I urge all of the Councilmembers to support and enact this legislation now before the Eviction moratorium expires.,105,,
688,0.97,5767.895,5772.066,And to face the tsunami of Evictions at the end of June.,105,,
689,0.97,5772.066,5780.508,I also want to thank Councilmember Sawant for bringing this legislation forward and for inviting me to speak today.,105,,
690,0.97,5780.508,5785.546,I thank you for the powerful remarks in support of my Union yesterday at our bargaining rally.,105,,
691,0.97,5785.546,5789.75,So as I said I'm a long time Seattle Renter.,105,,
692,0.97,5789.75,5804.798,I have lived in several different Seattle neighborhoods every lease in Seattle has been a term lease and I have never had one except for one that rolled into [Indiscernible] I had to renew with another Erm lease.,105,,
693,0.97,5804.798,5808.369,Including to the one I moved in to Ballard.,105,,
694,0.97,5808.369,5827.288,Giving that rents in Seattle are starting to rise in anticipation of the Eviction moratorium expiring I am nervous about the prospect of being evicted at the end of my lease here if my landlord decides to raise the Ren beyond what the law allows.,105,,
695,0.97,5827.288,5840.501,The vast majority of my fellow 412 Renters and when we moved we committed to programs for four to five years for undergraduate program and five or more for a Ph.D.,105,,
696,0.97,5840.501,5840.768,Program.,105,,
697,0.97,5840.768,5853.714,"When we moved here from out of state or from outside the country, we search for a place to Ren and most or all of us sign term leases that make it legal for our landlord to Evict us for no reason.",105,,
698,0.97,5853.714,5858.219,And at the same time the majority of the members are rent driven.,105,,
699,0.97,5858.219,5873.467,Which many paying over half of their income in rent and living close to the bone and many of us take out loans to make end meet because it is so expensive.,105,,
700,0.97,5873.467,5879.473,The housing Sig and the long term economics is nerve renting.,105,,
701,0.97,5879.473,5881.809,What we need most is housing stability.,105,,
702,0.97,5881.809,5885.88,Hard enough to be in school without having that stability.,105,,
703,0.97,5885.88,5902.062,Besides which Eviction is expensive and extremely disruptive and being evicted can drive a grad student out of school.,105,,
704,0.97,5902.062,5910.337,This is for Undocumented members and the 40% of our members are international scholars on temporary Visas.,105,,
705,0.97,5910.337,5910.671,Unacceptable.,105,,
706,0.97,5910.671,5912.973,Nobody should be subject to Eviction without just cause.,105,,
707,0.97,5912.973,5918.112,Not right that some Renters have that protection and others don't.,105,,
708,0.97,5918.112,5929.757,As the 4121 Mcmy and my fellow union members would not accept a situation where some members have protection against without just cause and others can lose with no reason.,105,,
709,0.97,5929.757,5951.145,"In a union contract just cause protection applies to everyone and if management tries to take it away we fight and we know it is super important and let me Express solidarity with Jacob at Elliot Bay and his members in this fight and, yes, just cause protection is always a key part of the Union contract.",105,,
710,0.97,5951.145,5959.753,So we want just cause protection by joining in solidarity and fighting as a group to make this and other improvements.,105,,
711,0.97,5959.753,5977.071,"We are in bargaining with the University and our contract expires Friday and some of what you propose would erode the just cause protection in our ."" as union members we are not standing for this Seattle Renters we won either.",105,,
712,0.97,5977.071,5989.55,Forming a union equalizing the relationship between the employers and being part of a union means that I and my fellow union members have the power to make our employees listen to us and negotiate with us.,105,,
713,0.97,5989.55,5991.151,They cap make unilateral changes to our work.,105,,
714,0.97,5991.151,5999.093,Before we had a union it was easy for you guys to ignore it but they can't ignore all 6000 of us.,105,,
715,0.97,5999.093,6011.905,We have seen the tenant organizing work and Kshama Sawant has been there to help organize against Evictions but the law as it stands is lopsided in favor of landlords.,105,,
716,0.97,6011.905,6020.381,By being here and making our voices heard in favor of the legislation hopefully we can change that.,105,,
717,0.97,6020.381,6031.392,Enacting just cause protection for Seattle Renters would be an important step between Renters and landlords and enacting the rights to Council last month leveled that playing field but we cap stop there.,105,,
718,0.97,6031.392,6035.729,We need just cause protection just as much as we need the right to Council.,105,,
719,0.97,6035.729,6038.532,They go hand in hand.,105,,
720,0.97,6038.532,6045.372,It is imperative that we close the loophole and extensive without just cause to all Seattle Renters.,105,,
721,0.97,6045.372,6054.948,"Thank you Councilmember Sawant for bringing the legislation forward and for helping us to make Seattle a better place to live, work and learn.",105,,
722,0.97,6054.948,6058.919,Thank you very much and please enact this legislation.,105,,
723,0.97,6058.919,6059.52,Both pieces.,105,,
724,0.97,6059.52,6061.688,"Thank you so much, Sharon.",106,,
725,0.97,6061.688,6085.579,That was powerful and thank you for having the UAW regular Gail Regalia in the background.,106,,
726,0.97,6085.579,6100.494,It is a shining thing and you have been on the frost line for the housing struggles and on the Amazon tax movement as well and really just quite inspiring for workers and Renters the example you have shown.,106,,
727,0.97,6100.494,6117.911,I wanted to quickly say that we the next item by 4:00 and my E most sincere apologies for the delay to getting to that to our Presenters.,106,,
728,0.97,6117.911,6133.527,"But last but not least our community Speaker is Sean Butterfield and Sean, again as everyone has done introduce yourself and then talk about your experience.",106,,
729,0.97,6133.527,6133.794,Welcome.,106,,
730,0.97,6133.794,6134.027,Hi.,107,,
731,0.97,6134.027,6136.964,So my name is Sean Butterfield.,107,,
732,0.97,6136.964,6150.177,I'm a member of SI U 775 and a Caregiver for my disabled partner charity and we live together in a rented Parm on Capitol Hill.,107,,
733,0.97,6150.177,6165.125,I want to speak in the prospective of people with disabilities about the loophole allowing landlords to end a tenancy for any reason even if they are going to just turn around and rent it to somebody else after you move out.,107,,
734,0.97,6165.125,6176.904,"About my particular Sig my partner, charity, has a progressive disability, that means she can't stand or transfer from her bed or wheelchair without assistance.",107,,
735,0.97,6176.904,6182.509,That used to mean balancing help but now it is a Caregiver giving the body weight and moving her.,107,,
736,0.97,6182.509,6192.886,After years of effort on my part to have Efhs install a lift this was granted a few years ago.,107,,
737,0.97,6192.886,6202.529,This has meant we can hire any Caregiver and not limit us to those with the strength to lift her like most of us she ain't getting any lighter as she gets older.,107,,
738,0.97,6202.529,6210.27,And it has meant to move her basically without the risk of injuring her.,107,,
739,0.97,6210.27,6225.185,"However, as the years have come by we have relied on this list as the disability has progressed and realized how rely reliant we are to the Department.",107,,
740,0.97,6225.185,6247.908,Each of the past ten years our lease has been renewed but each year brings a Pallable fear we will be forced to move and go without technology that is installed in our home and for years until Dhs will install it in a new apartment from which we ould have easily been evicted after six months or a year.,107,,
741,0.97,6247.908,6251.578,I want to be clear it is not just.,107,,
742,0.97,6251.578,6260.554,Anybody that uses a wheelchair or requires specific amenities already has incredibly difficult time finding and keeping housing.,107,,
743,0.97,6260.554,6277.971,Beyond the deficit of Ada and apartment Compliances landlords do their best to remove disabled presents and often because of the accommodations that they require or because real chairs can cause Scuffing of paints and units.,107,,
744,0.97,6277.971,6298.458,Charity's previous landlord has refused to remove the lease because of the minor wear and tear and they never need to defend and in court at that time and they wouldn't today because when landlords Evict disabled tenants they do so with loop holes like the Loop holes we are discussing today.,107,,
745,0.97,6298.458,6310.637,This kind of Eviction is disruptive to all Renters and particularly to people with disabilities that must struggle to find new housing.,107,,
746,0.97,6310.637,6328.655,People with disabilities rely on friendly neighbors for small favors and in formal care giving services and takes months or years to ask people to help pull their pants.,107,,
747,0.97,6328.655,6332.993,Retrieve important object under the bed or get back in their wheelchair.,107,,
748,0.97,6332.993,6341.435,These kinds of relationships are the fabric of community and every Eviction has a Gapping hole in that fabric.,107,,
749,0.97,6341.435,6347.774,Renters like that desperately need protection from the's because of power between tenants and landlords.,107,,
750,0.97,6347.774,6365.659,The just cause legislation before this committee advanced by Councilmember Sawant would give us semblance of long term security and I hope this Committee and the whole counsel would vote the legislation to law before the expiration of the Eviction moratorium that are here to follow.,107,,
751,0.97,6365.659,6370.831,I would like to thank Councilmember Sawant for inviting me to be here today.,107,,
752,0.97,6370.831,6376.203,Thank you for your time.,107,,
753,0.97,6376.203,6380.207,"Thank you, Sean.",108,,
754,0.97,6380.207,6432.559,"And I know many are in similar situations to provide care for a family member like you are for your partner and the struggles that you all are facing and I have heard from members about being in home Givers mean you don't have a workplace that you need to come and get organized and that is a challenge and similar isolation so I counter that by getting Renters organized and so important to have the voices and especially, I want to thank everybody that spoke and especially Sean and Jordan for bringing in the voices from our disabled community members because Sean you said they are vulnerable to the imbalance of power between Representers and corporate landlords.",108,,
755,0.97,6432.559,6432.993,Much appreciated.,108,,
756,0.97,6432.993,6438.031,Wanted to quickly open up for questions and apologize to Councilmembers.,108,,
757,0.97,6438.031,6453.713,We have our Presenters waiting and we have struggled to fit everything in one committee and don't want to cancel items because the Presenters have made time and I want to respect them.,108,,
758,0.97,6453.713,6457.918,And I want to apologize so please go ahead and raise your hands.,108,,
759,0.97,6457.918,6463.123,I had questions but I will wait for other Councilmembers.,108,,
760,0.97,6463.123,6463.79,Councilmember Morales go ahead.,108,,
761,0.97,6463.79,6464.691,Thank you.,109,,
762,0.97,6464.691,6474.835,I want to be clear that we have done both community panels.,109,,
763,0.97,6474.835,6476.536,The two issues.,109,,
764,0.97,6476.536,6483.743,Wanted to make comments about Bot.,109,,
765,0.97,6483.743,6483.944,Okay?,109,,
766,0.97,6483.944,6485.078,So regarding Council bill 12046.,109,,
767,0.97,6485.078,6487.38,I want to thank you Councilmember Sawant for this.,109,,
768,0.97,6487.38,6498.859,It is important that we make sure we are protecting children and their families at an elementary school where my daughter goes.,109,,
769,0.97,6498.859,6505.565,I think it is 1 in 10 children lack stable housing.,109,,
770,0.97,6505.565,6518.645,"Experiencing homelessness or in a shelter and over 50%, close to 60% are on lunches and there is need in the community.",109,,
771,0.97,6518.645,6518.979,Just quickly.,109,,
772,0.97,6518.979,6527.087,I do want to address some of the questions or comments that came up regarding the just cause Eviction ordinance.,109,,
773,0.97,6527.087,6535.662,"Colleagues know that we will be discussing my bill, council bill 120057.",109,,
774,0.97,6535.662,6543.37,Takes a slightly different approach than the bill that we are hearing about today from Kshama Sawant.,109,,
775,0.97,6543.37,6576.369,I want to thank you about the opportunity to hear my bill later and thank Councilmember Lewis for Cosponsoring and the member of the stay healthy coalition and thank Councilmember Sawant for her request for sponsorship and will gladly accept that and my hope is to schedule a meeting between now and the next regularly scheduled meeting so we have a chance to hear from the community members that we have been working with on the bill.,109,,
776,0.97,6576.369,6589.249,And look forward to the opportunity to vote hear both bills and I think may 25th is the next committee meeting so I know we are trying to get to the next panel.,109,,
777,0.97,6589.249,6595.155,I will work with central staff to see if we can have kind of a side by side of both bills.,109,,
778,0.97,6595.155,6606.566,The last thing that I do need to note that in the summary and fiscal NOTE for our legislation has been updated.,109,,
779,0.97,6606.566,6611.471,That should be on Legislastar and includes language in the summary portion of the bill.,109,,
780,0.97,6611.471,6618.411,I wanted to make sure that is noted for the record.,109,,
781,0.97,6618.411,6620.313,"That's all I have, thank you.",109,,
782,0.97,6620.313,6631.391,Thank you for your comments Councilmember Morales and for responding to Cosponsoring your bill.,110,,
783,0.97,6631.391,6642.202,I am happy to cosponsor that and as I said before my staff is working on scheduling a meeting between today and the 25th because we don't want to wait until then.,110,,
784,0.97,6642.202,6644.07,So we will be doing that.,110,,
785,0.97,6644.07,6666.826,We want to have more discussion on the bill to ban the Evictions of school children and educators during the school year and as our community members today have said so eloquently it is so important.,110,,
786,0.97,6666.826,6669.329,We don't have Matthew Maley here at this time and students.,110,,
787,0.97,6669.329,6672.365,We hope it will happen in the future.,110,,
788,0.97,6672.365,6677.37,Hard to have a community member show up while in school.,110,,
789,0.97,6677.37,6686.479,Especially to show up during school time and we don't want to disrupt school children learning anymore than can be helped.,110,,
790,0.97,6686.479,6691.184,In fact these are children already experiencing disruption.,110,,
791,0.97,6691.184,6693.353,I had a couple of comments quickly.,110,,
792,0.97,6693.353,6699.459,I am looking and scanning to see if Councilmembers have Questios.,110,,
793,0.97,6699.459,6700.827,I will wait.,110,,
794,0.97,6700.827,6702.162,Go ahead Councilmember Pedersen.,110,,
795,0.97,6702.162,6707.634,"Thank you, chair Sawant and thank you for structuring this so that it was a briefing and discussion today.",111,,
796,0.97,6707.634,6708.702,And not a vote.,111,,
797,0.97,6708.702,6720.346,So that we had time to hear from everyone that you brought here thanks to everybody for showing up today and giving us your testimony.,111,,
798,0.97,6720.346,6727.787,I'm glad that Councilmember Morales was able to work out with your bills together.,111,,
799,0.97,6727.787,6754.981,"And then in terms of the two bills before us, 46, about schools and 56 about the term leases and just cause, should I just ask, I want to ask central staff some questions so that they could flesh out--I'm assuming they will be doing memos for the next committee meeting.",111,,
800,0.97,6754.981,6755.748,Is that the idea?,111,,
801,0.97,6755.748,6761.654,There are things that I am hoping you can explore when you draft your memos.,111,,
802,0.97,6761.654,6766.993,You don't need to answer but I want to get out a couple of questions.,111,,
803,0.97,6766.993,6767.627,That is okay chair Sawant?,111,,
804,0.97,6767.627,6768.595,Yes.,112,,
805,0.97,6768.595,6770.33,That sounds fine.,112,,
806,0.97,6770.33,6771.131,Go ahead.,112,,
807,0.97,6771.131,6773.7,Thank you.,113,,
808,0.97,6773.7,6795.388,"So for central staff just going over 120046 about schools, I heard references to the San Francisco California ordinance I guess that was in 2016.",113,,
809,0.97,6795.388,6798.925,Washington and California state law are different.,113,,
810,0.97,6798.925,6809.235,"I wanted to know if the central staff members could look at what were the results there, sort of the before and after results.",113,,
811,0.97,6809.235,6825.852,Curious as to whether--because landlords can still Evict during the summer months I believe and wanted to know if there is a spike in Evictions that occur in the summer or that is a concern that didn't actually happen.,113,,
812,0.97,6825.852,6831.858,It seems like we would have data on that now after a couple of years.,113,,
813,0.97,6831.858,6851.01,And curious about the issue of school employees versus smaller universe of educators that have that educational relationship directly with the students versus just school children protecting the school children and their families.,113,,
814,0.97,6851.01,6861.788,Sort of the different--the universe getting bigger and what the pros and cons of that are.,113,,
815,0.97,6861.788,6873.132,Regarding the--and we might have more questions later but just off of the top of my head after hearing from everybody today.,113,,
816,0.97,6873.132,6885.044,"On the next bill, 120056, you know, I have been supportive of several of the tenant protection laws and the winter ban.",113,,
817,0.97,6885.044,6896.99,We did amend the right to free Council and I ultimately supported that and we have had a lot of relief programs for tenants during the Covid pandemic that I support.,113,,
818,0.97,6896.99,6905.498,I am concerned about the 120056 because I have been--we have been following HB House bill 1236.,113,,
819,0.97,6905.498,6917.81,I think one of the speakers talked about that as well today.,113,,
820,0.97,6917.81,6927.82,It seems that Hb1236 allows landlords after the end of the first year that they give 60 day in this that can end as agreed.,113,,
821,0.97,6927.82,6936.329,"And so I'm trying to reconcile, my understanding is that state law would preempt the local laws.",113,,
822,0.97,6936.329,6944.037,I want to understand more about that issue since that bill is going to go in effect and we are proposing something.,113,,
823,0.97,6944.037,6948.408,And this bill is proposing something different.,113,,
824,0.97,6948.408,6958.051,Concerned about that and concerned about the impact of small landlords that we have heard those landlords--some landlords coming in.,113,,
825,0.97,6958.051,6967.093,I know in the winter ban we define those owning four or fewer units.,113,,
826,0.97,6967.093,6975.501,There is concern about corporate landlords and I don't view the smaller landlords in the same way and don have the economy of scale.,113,,
827,0.97,6975.501,6993.386,"They seem to try to work with tenants and just concerned about applying this so broadly, this 120056.",113,,
828,0.97,6993.386,7001.06,So wanted to see if other cities had a similar law outside of Washington State and whether they have exemptions for small landlords.,113,,
829,0.97,7001.06,7008.835,Those are just some thoughts for central staff when you craft your memo for the next round of discussion.,113,,
830,0.97,7008.835,7015.608,Thank you chair Sawant for getting us a space to throw out ideas and ask questions to central staff.,113,,
831,0.97,7015.608,7015.908,Thank you.,113,,
832,0.97,7015.908,7020.179,Thank you for those questions I think they are all useful to get clarified.,114,,
833,0.97,7020.179,7030.957,"And yes, as I said in the interest of time I really appreciate you being okay with having the memos that central staff would do it any way.",114,,
834,0.97,7030.957,7037.33,But I don't want to give them anytime to respond at all right now.,114,,
835,0.97,7037.33,7046.472,So--and I know that we have information about San Francisco school bill and can add something.,114,,
836,0.97,7046.472,7063.089,I am just saying that again apologies to the green deal Presenters that we will give a few minutes over but as you can see we are struggling to make sure that you all don't have to wait for too long.,114,,
837,0.97,7063.089,7063.589,Asha and Aly go ahead.,114,,
838,0.97,7063.589,7082.442,Thank you for the questions and we certainly will follow up and I want to set expectations in terms of what we are producing for the next committee meeting and some of this information might be useful for Councilmembers to have in hand and in advance of future discussions depending on the schedule.,115,,
839,0.97,7082.442,7089.315,We will do the best to get the materials to be available.,115,,
840,0.97,7089.315,7111.838,I wanted to let you know that and it won't come in the form of a memo and we will try to get you information sooner rather than later in terms of amendments and then just want to note that we can follow up and get more,115,,
841,0.97,7118.578,7122.715,It is not an apples to apples consider comparison.,116,,
842,0.97,7122.715,7132.091,It will be fully applicable to this proposal because this provides trader protections for tenants I think than the San Francisco law.,116,,
843,0.97,7132.091,7142.935,Quickly on the state law I wanted to confirm we are looking at that carefully and are working on a Side-By-Side look at what that is doing.,116,,
844,0.97,7142.935,7159.819,It may have other implications for the cities Eviction ordinance generally speaking as well as helping highlight the differences between Councilmember Sawant's proposal.,116,,
845,0.97,7159.819,7162.455,"Thank you, I appreciate that.",117,,
846,0.97,7162.455,7165.925,Asha do you want to add anything?,117,,
847,0.97,7165.925,7170.162,I see her shaking her head.,117,,
848,0.97,7170.162,7174.033,I will call on Dan.,117,,
849,0.97,7174.033,7189.448,I can speak briefly about the questions for San Francisco and the bill Crafted to cover all educators and all employees of schools.,118,,
850,0.97,7189.448,7201.694,The bill in San Francisco does cover all educators and all employees of schools and on a personal NOTE I used to be an educator and a teacher and have some experience with this.,118,,
851,0.97,7201.694,7219.512,"All the staff at the school really work together to make a culture and a team within the school, a culture of learning and there are all of these best practices in school that do involve all of the staff.",118,,
852,0.97,7219.512,7225.618,Things like Schoolwide positive behavior support and intervention is appropriate that involves all staff.,118,,
853,0.97,7225.618,7229.121,That is just one example.,118,,
854,0.97,7229.121,7231.591,There are many things like this that really do involve all staff.,118,,
855,0.97,7231.591,7241.2,And all the research shows that turnover of school staff has a big impact on the education of students.,118,,
856,0.97,7241.2,7242.735,A big impact.,118,,
857,0.97,7242.735,7249.809,Some of that research is included in the recital of the bill.,118,,
858,0.97,7249.809,7253.646,Also wanted to speak to the results from San Francisco.,118,,
859,0.97,7253.646,7262.622,As was explained there is a huge difference between the two bills.,118,,
860,0.97,7262.622,7264.056,The bill in San Francisco is quite limited.,118,,
861,0.97,7264.056,7268.561,It only covers certain No-Fault Evictions.,118,,
862,0.97,7268.561,7277.069,"So if the landlord wants to renovate the apartment, that can't happen during the school year.",118,,
863,0.97,7277.069,7283.376,About nine out of 10 Evictions in Seattle according to the losing home reports are for nonpayment of rent.,118,,
864,0.97,7283.376,7289.048,So that nine out of 10 is not covered by the San Francisco bill.,118,,
865,0.97,7289.048,7295.488,The reality is there bill covers a very small fraction of Evictions.,118,,
866,0.97,7295.488,7297.69,Probably too small to show meaningful results.,118,,
867,0.97,7297.69,7320.68,"Our bill covers almost all types of Evictions except for certain types that are required by law like if the building is condemned and the city or state requires people to leave, that sort of thing.",118,,
868,0.97,7320.68,7327.62,And the one other question was about House bill 1236.,118,,
869,0.97,7327.62,7335.461,They were both in the Senate and the House there were attempts by Republicans to add in language to make it Pre-And cities.,118,,
870,0.97,7335.461,7337.196,And those amendments failed.,118,,
871,0.97,7337.196,7341.701,So that is a good legislative record that it does not preempt the city.,118,,
872,0.97,7341.701,7353.479,That is not the intention of that bill to prevent the city to create stronger defenses to Renters.,118,,
873,0.97,7353.479,7355.848,But I'm not a lawyer so you will have to ask a lawyer.,118,,
874,0.97,7355.848,7358.15,"Thank you, Ted.",119,,
875,0.97,7358.15,7371.33,"Terry, I want to invite you if you want to add anything especially about the state house bill but in general from your knowledge about these things?",119,,
876,0.97,7371.33,7372.965,I was going to say the same thing.,120,,
877,0.97,7372.965,7374.533,There is no state Preemption on just cause.,120,,
878,0.97,7374.533,7389.982,And there were two cities prior to the state and acting 1236 that already had included term lease in just cause.,120,,
879,0.97,7389.982,7394.653,I think that an easy way to do it would be to just remove those Probationary periods.,120,,
880,0.97,7394.653,7404.797,"I share concerns about that . In Spokane where we are working on a suite of tenant protections that is the one thing that we will be talking about here, too.",120,,
881,0.97,7404.797,7423.282,It seems to me that landlords would just issue a term lease and then 60 days before the end of the lease issue a no cause notice and that keeps it pretty much the same as it is right now.,120,,
882,0.97,7423.282,7439.832,Originally it was just for the first year that they would get that Probationary period that most of us objected to but there were legislators that wouldn't support it without it.,120,,
883,0.97,7439.832,7457.616,And then when they added the ability to extend that probation into Perpetuity the only thing that really protects is rent increases because if they were just to allow those to go Month- To-Month than those tenants do get just cause Eviction.,120,,
884,0.97,7457.616,7486.679,"I am hearing that the majority of Renters in Seattle are term lease Renters and I think that is interesting because of the loophole . In Spokane where we don't have any just cause protections for month-to-month Renters, obviously you can see most of the Renters over here are month-to-month because the landlords can then do a rent increase was 60 days notice.",120,,
885,0.97,7486.679,7507.199,"Anything that Incentivizes, or perhaps what our concern was was landlords if they would only offer month-to-month it was a real barrier for tenants with vouchers that are requiring a one-year lease for the initial lease period.",120,,
886,0.97,7507.199,7513.272,So we kept that first year as a year so this would be good for tenants with vouchers.,120,,
887,0.97,7513.272,7518.911,Other than that I don't see that the state bill is very helpful for tenants in Seattle.,120,,
888,0.97,7518.911,7521.58,I'm sorry to say.,120,,
889,0.97,7521.58,7526.185,Except for month-to-month.,120,,
890,0.97,7526.185,7529.321,Thank you.,121,,
891,0.97,7529.321,7530.689,Stated in very accurate terms.,121,,
892,0.97,7530.689,7555.948,"Incidentally you answer the question I was going to ask which is why was the landlord so adamant against closing the loophole in Seattle but you answer the question by saying in cities where there are Month- To-Month leases and that is the majority, landlords go after that and they don't want protections for them.",121,,
893,0.97,7555.948,7556.815,Exactly.,122,,
894,0.97,7556.815,7557.85,Yes.,122,,
895,0.97,7557.85,7561.754,In Seattle term leases are the majority so there you go.,123,,
896,0.97,7561.754,7563.422,They don't want to close that loophole.,123,,
897,0.97,7563.422,7588.247,"If they didn't do that they would have to give just cause protection for those Month-To- month tenants and in fact, my feeling is that Seattle landlords kind of get the best of it because they also get the longevity of a year-long tenants, a tenant paying a year worth of rent.",124,,
898,0.97,7588.247,7596.255,It doesn't seem fair that they lock you into paying for a full year and then can terminate so easily.,124,,
899,0.97,7596.255,7605.064,I support what ever you all do in Seattle and we would like to use it for a model for other cities in the state.,124,,
900,0.97,7605.064,7606.699,Well said.,125,,
901,0.97,7606.699,7608.5,I completely agree.,125,,
902,0.97,7608.5,7609.568,Thank you.,126,,
903,0.97,7609.568,7622.381,"And the point you made that was made by somebody in public comment about if you are a small landlord, a lot of small landlords are union members.",127,,
904,0.97,7622.381,7644.937,"It is not like they are rich people, they are one unit that they can rent out and it is a small amount of income that they get and they always say that term leases are better for landlords who are not looking to exploit Renters because that longevity means they don't have to seek Renters all the time.",127,,
905,0.97,7644.937,7646.905,Corporate landlords have a completely different equation.,127,,
906,0.97,7646.905,7651.81,They don't want Renters to feel comfortable and empowered in any way.,127,,
907,0.97,7651.81,7661.754,Higher turnover is good for them and right now they are also able to increase rent.,127,,
908,0.97,7661.754,7668.861,"Totally, I was going to say the same thing.",128,,
909,0.97,7668.861,7674.967,You see the dilemma of a rent increase or a fixed term loophole.,128,,
910,0.97,7674.967,7701.56,Either way the landlord has the balance of power in order to either terminate a tenant for make them so that rent is so Unaffordable that they will far and voluntarily Evict themselves any rental locations or economic displacement would be helpful in lieu of the fact that cities can't enact rent control because of the state law.,128,,
911,0.97,7701.56,7708.0,"Absolutely, Terry, I'm so glad also mentioned that.",129,,
912,0.97,7708.0,7711.703,"I don't know if you are aware and we should connect with you, my staff will connect with you.",129,,
913,0.97,7711.703,7723.282,A couple of years ago my office has this legislation for economic assistant Fort tenants who are economically evicted.,129,,
914,0.97,7723.282,7725.317,When rent went up and you end up self Evicting.,129,,
915,0.97,7725.317,7749.041,"We don't even have Embers or statistics for number of Renters who end up leaving because the rent went up . So we brought forward a bill, not that we formally introduced it but we really want to build a movement around it to win this because we know that landlords will absolutely oppose it.",129,,
916,0.97,7749.041,7754.713,And just talking about it publicly and organizing a meeting.,129,,
917,0.97,7754.713,7759.251,Already it elicited corporate landlord anger.,129,,
918,0.97,7759.251,7770.662,Landlord should pay economic assistance to the tenants who are forced to move because they chose to increase the rent and it is punitive because of the amount of rent they are able to increase.,129,,
919,0.97,7770.662,7772.464,Completely.,130,,
920,0.97,7772.464,7778.17,And I think it is also retaliatory for tenants that have just cause protection.,130,,
921,0.97,7778.17,7778.57,Absolutely.,131,,
922,0.97,7778.57,7779.571,Exactly.,131,,
923,0.97,7779.571,7781.774,That is totally right.,131,,
924,0.97,7781.774,7785.477,So thank you so much for being here today.,131,,
925,0.97,7785.477,7787.913,We definitely are hoping you can join us in future committees.,131,,
926,0.97,7787.913,7794.686,And my staff will contact you off-line about the other bills as well.,131,,
927,0.97,7794.686,7796.054,We really need input.,131,,
928,0.97,7796.054,7804.363,And we need this thing to wear activists in different cities are collaborating and building movement together because that is what actually will help us.,131,,
929,0.97,7804.363,7806.398,Thank you.,132,,
930,0.97,7806.398,7809.368,And thank you for your leadership.,132,,
931,0.97,7809.368,7814.706,And thank you for your right to counsel bill that you have in Seattle which is awesome.,132,,
932,0.97,7814.706,7816.909,Better than what the state did.,132,,
933,0.97,7816.909,7823.815,We look to Seattle for leadership in the state as well.,132,,
934,0.97,7823.815,7829.888,The reason we won is because we are inventors in the state.,133,,
935,0.97,7829.888,7836.962,"When you have politicians doing insider negotiations, they give into corporate landlords and we don't want to let that happen here.",133,,
936,0.97,7836.962,7842.601,That is why my office always insist on organizing Renters.,133,,
937,0.97,7842.601,7844.837,That is the thing that corporate Renters fear the most.,133,,
938,0.97,7844.837,7848.841,I think that is what we have been hoping.,134,,
939,0.97,7848.841,7854.813,Now that just cause has passed we hope that month-to-month tenants will be organized as well.,134,,
940,0.97,7854.813,7862.254,That has totally prevented them from getting involved with a lot of organizing activities because of the fear of a 20 day notice.,134,,
941,0.97,7862.254,7863.855,That is a huge fear.,134,,
942,0.97,7863.855,7864.856,Absolutely.,135,,
943,0.97,7864.856,7873.665,"And likewise, please let the Renters and activists in Spokane know that my office is at the ready to help you all there.",135,,
944,0.97,7873.665,7878.437,Whatever you can win only helps Renters in Seattle.,135,,
945,0.97,7878.437,7879.137,Thank you.,136,,
946,0.97,7879.137,7885.377,We don't want any intellectual property on either vaccines.,136,,
947,0.97,7885.377,7893.952,We just want solidarity and working together and moving forward.,137,,
948,0.97,7893.952,7895.32,"I see that happening, so thank you.",137,,
949,0.97,7895.32,7896.154,Thank you so much.,138,,
950,0.97,7896.154,7896.588,Absolutely.,138,,
951,0.97,7896.588,7898.19,Solidarity and working together.,138,,
952,0.97,7898.19,7899.791,Thank you all so much.,139,,
953,0.97,7899.791,7903.895,I appreciate Council members engaging on both bills and think you for all the questions that came up.,139,,
954,0.97,7903.895,7911.87,And thank you to staff members and Asha Venkataraman and Aly Pennucci.,139,,
955,0.97,7911.87,7912.804,Quick apologies to everyone.,139,,
956,0.97,7912.804,7921.313,I want to quickly turn to our last extremely important item because we are talking about the climate crisis that faces us.,139,,
957,0.97,7921.313,7936.495,And as I said before we need to be sober about the fact that Seattle and the rest of the world is completely failing at this moment to make the adjustments needed to address the impending climate catastrophe.,139,,
958,0.97,7936.495,7940.832,And not for lack of ordinary people wanting it to be addressed.,139,,
959,0.97,7940.832,7969.361,"Our Presenters who are about to speak, we know we need to rapidly Electrify our city's infrastructure and we know it is going to require big investments in green infrastructure that can only be funded by substantial new big business taxes and I'm hoping that this discussion, even though it won't encompass all the things we need to talk about but it will be a discussion that will be part of hopefully ongoing discussions.",139,,
960,0.97,7969.361,7975.634,Not just discussions but discussion followed by actions and organizing.,139,,
961,0.97,7975.634,7985.744,Many Presenters are organizers and leaders on Street movements and have we have worked with many of them before.,139,,
962,0.97,7985.744,7987.546,I wanted to welcome you all.,139,,
963,0.97,7987.546,7994.686,"We have matt, Rachel, DEB Alina, deep and just.",139,,

If I can deviate just quickly, it made my heart feels so good, I don't know if she left but to see Terry Anderson speaking on here.",140,,
973,0.97,8053.011,8071.063,"Her and I worked together back in the 90S and early 2000 on some regional environmental justice issues bringing together tribes, Farmworkers and urban communities to fight on this very issue that we are talking about today.",140,,
974,0.97,8071.063,8071.93,Saying hello to Terry.,140,,
975,0.97,8071.93,8080.772,"I will pass it to Debolina, Deepa, Jess, whoever wants to go next.",140,,

987,0.97,8126.885,8128.92,Hello.,143,,
988,0.97,8128.92,8132.991,My name is Jess Wallach . I use She/Her pronouns.,143,,
989,0.97,8132.991,8137.028,I live in district 6 and I am an Organizer with 350 Seattle.,143,,
990,0.97,8137.028,8142.801,And recently granted to the green new deal oversight board.,143,,
991,0.97,8142.801,8143.735,Thanks for having us here.,143,,
992,0.97,8143.735,8152.744,I should have mentioned Rachel Unfortunately could not be here with us today.,144,,
993,0.97,8152.744,8156.214,She too was recently nominated to sit on the green new deal advisory board.,144,,
994,0.97,8156.214,8164.322,She is working with the cultural Department with the Muckleshoot tribe but she had other obligations.,144,,
995,0.97,8164.322,8166.558,Apologies on behalf of Rachel.,144,,
996,0.97,8166.558,8183.175,Thank you Council members I want and to all the other Council members for the opportunity to share a little bit about the super important necessary work of moving forward with our Seattle green new deal.,144,,
997,0.97,8183.175,8231.122,"I am honored to be working alongside the other Presenters here today who are going to touch on the different subject areas that we need to look at while addressing the green new deal raging from transportation, housing, Council members already mentioned Electrification as well as the need for mass investment into the green new deal . We don't really need to spend the time going over the details of where we are at with the climate crisis.",144,,
998,0.97,8231.122,8233.892,I think we are all quite knowledgeable in that area at this point.,144,,
999,0.97,8233.892,8242.434,We saw from Osc last time we gathered that Seattle's emissions are actually going up.,144,,
1000,0.97,8242.434,8255.614,"So, we need some bold action in moving forward to meet our goals to reducing Seattle's greenhouse gas emissions.",144,,
1001,0.97,8255.614,8265.457,And going to start off with Debolina who will kick us off in energy justice.,144,,
1002,0.97,8265.457,8268.927,"Thank you, matt.",145,,
1003,0.97,8268.927,8274.165,I want to acknowledge the fact that we are not a whole board over here.,145,,
1004,0.97,8274.165,8290.682,"Speaking for myself, whatever I talk about today will mostly be some of the Learnings that Sage had to our work and the priorities that we have been working on after hearing from communities.",145,,
1005,0.97,8290.682,8297.689,"So, the energy industry has always been a major piece in addressing climate change.",145,,
1006,0.97,8297.689,8311.703,And last year 2020 about the injustice and in the energy sector out into the open for those who are not plugged into the conversations and into the movement.,145,,
1007,0.97,8311.703,8320.278,We have Sage started working on energy justice since 2019 with committee members to explore what it means to do energy policy in a racially just way.,145,,
1008,0.97,8320.278,8326.685,To us it means we lead with what is important for our people.,145,,
1009,0.97,8326.685,8334.893,It means we don't get distracted by fancy new technology but start by addressing the disproportionate in equities for us.,145,,
1010,0.97,8334.893,8356.281,"It means we think of democratic processes to layout energy policies, not Chase after false problems and instead think about energy policies in terms of transportation justice, housing justice, food justice, economic justice, workers rights.",145,,
1011,0.97,8356.281,8360.352,Ultimately just transition funded by revenue.,145,,
1012,0.97,8360.352,8377.435,What you see on the slide is some climate concerns that have stayed the same since our first talks on climate in 2015 and priorities have stayed the same and then we listed some recommendations over here that we heard from community members.,145,,
1013,0.97,8377.435,8382.674,Can you go to the next slide please?,145,,
1014,0.97,8382.674,8392.083,Here the communities that we talked to in our research are non-English speaking.,145,,
1015,0.97,8392.083,8400.692,They were in the income bracket of 10K-50 K per year . In 2018 the AMI for Seattle was 90 5K.,145,,
1016,0.97,8400.692,8408.099,We also had 35% community members who were disabled.,145,,
1017,0.97,8408.099,8417.809,That means they were constantly relying on energy for devices or medicines and all of that.,145,,
1018,0.97,8417.809,8423.681,We conducted listening sessions and interviews to collect the data.,145,,
1019,0.97,8423.681,8426.751,"What we learned is in a rising energy crisis, people are really concerned about that.",145,,
1020,0.97,8426.751,8435.927,"And low income households seek to cut down on necessities whether it is rent, mortgage, food, medicine to afford their energy bills.",145,,
1021,0.97,8435.927,8445.637,They face so much barriers in benefiting from the low income energy assistance programs and this is not just Seattle.,145,,
1022,0.97,8445.637,8450.708,It is South Seattle and Southland County.,145,,
1023,0.97,8450.708,8453.945,I wanted to be transparent about the geographic area over here.,145,,
1024,0.97,8453.945,8463.154,Some of the things that we learned is that increasing 100% of energy household is really important right now.,145,,
1025,0.97,8463.154,8470.528,With in Seattle we have 75%.,145,,
1026,0.97,8470.528,8485.276,Increasing the programs accessibility and improving community outreach and also expanding energy efficiency retrofit programs.,145,,
1027,0.97,8485.276,8487.779,With Anti-Displacement policies with some recommendations that we heard.,145,,
1028,0.97,8487.779,8489.647,Next slide please?,145,,
1029,0.97,8489.647,8506.698,We can't talk about energy justice without talking about transportation . It plays a huge role in transportation and also housing which Jess will talk more about.,146,,
1030,0.97,8506.698,8519.11,What we heard is that people really wanted the city to focus on public transit.,146,,
1031,0.97,8519.11,8527.285,And electric vehicles.,146,,
1032,0.97,8527.285,8529.721,They featured last on their priority list.,146,,
1033,0.97,8529.721,8538.029,Shifting our focus from individual to offering more choice was important.,146,,
1034,0.97,8538.029,8540.231,Electrification of public transit.,146,,
1035,0.97,8540.231,8542.934,And improving accessibility.,146,,
1036,0.97,8542.934,8550.642,Increasing options and bearing transit investments with Anti- displacement strategies.,146,,
1037,0.97,8550.642,8563.021,We cannot reduce greenhouse gas emissions if we are talking about it if our people who are mostly transit dependent are pushed out of the transit areas.,146,,
1038,0.97,8563.021,8564.522,In places where we have more transit options.,146,,
1039,0.97,8564.522,8565.056,End up driving.,146,,
1040,0.97,8565.056,8567.959,That is not a logical step.,146,,
1041,0.97,8567.959,8574.232,Increasing more transit options is what we should be thinking about and that is what we heard from our community members.,146,,
1042,0.97,8574.232,8587.378,"The majority of low income community members with $30,000 per year, they were the ones who relied mostly on transit.",146,,
1043,0.97,8587.378,8593.885,And with this I will pass on to Jess.,146,,
1044,0.97,8593.885,8594.285,Thank you.,147,,
1045,0.97,8594.285,8595.353,I think matt is next.,147,,
1046,0.97,8595.353,8596.354,"Matt, you are up.",148,,
1047,0.97,8596.354,8598.99,Back to me.,149,,
1048,0.97,8598.99,8605.697,Thank you Debolina.,149,,
1049,0.97,8605.697,8613.204,In keeping along the theme of energy and Deepa will go deeper into Electrification here shortly.,149,,
1050,0.97,8613.204,8654.846,But one of the things that I know for those of us here working together and within our broader coalitions we really hope as Seattle moves forward with its efforts at Electrification or meeting its greenhouse gas emission reductions that it take an Intersectional analysis approach to its policies . for example currently tracked gas that Seattle gets through Puget sound energy.,149,,
1051,0.97,8654.846,8676.367,", Puget sound energy purchases the bulk of the natural or Fracked gas comes from British Columbia or Alberta and to the lesser extent the rocky mountain region.",149,,
1052,0.97,8676.367,8682.674,In the pictures that you see on their the top photo are Fracking sights coming out of British Columbia.,149,,
1053,0.97,8682.674,8697.889,The majority of these Fracking sights up in BC and Alberta take place on or near first nations community . This is what we mean in terms of Intersectional analysis.,149,,
1054,0.97,8697.889,8719.377,It is not that the gas that we use here in Seattle contributes will to greenhouse gas emissions but it has direct impact on the communities from where Puget sound energy is purchasing from.,149,,
1055,0.97,8719.377,8751.609,I encourage especially as we move into looking at the fossil fuel study that will be discussed in a few weeks that we also look at candidates Canada's inquiry that they released into missing indigenous women and I would like to acknowledge Councilmember Juarez for her leadership and work on this issue.,149,,
1056,0.97,8751.609,8764.755,These same Fracking sites that we are getting our gas from are highlighted in this inquiry as Epicenters for the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women.,149,,
1057,0.97,8764.755,8771.629,"The photo right below that Fracking site, those are man camps.",149,,
1058,0.97,8771.629,8785.076,That is one located up in British Columbia near the Fracking site . These man camps are notorious for the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women.,149,,
1059,0.97,8785.076,8788.079,Go ahead and go to the next line.,149,,
1060,0.97,8788.079,8796.888,"One of the things as Councilmember Sawant mentioned, is the need to look into investments into green infrastructure.",149,,
1061,0.97,8796.888,8813.504,I have had the privilege to be sitting on the design team with Seattle public utilities for their fifty-year shape our water plan and this is something that Spu is looking into.,149,,
1062,0.97,8813.504,8820.811,We came across this innovative company out of Oregon who has developed water turbines.,149,,
1063,0.97,8820.811,8825.216,We have a short clip here.,149,,
1064,0.97,8825.216,8829.187,"Apologies, I don't have the Video queued up . I apologize.",150,,
1065,0.97,8829.187,8831.322,We will have to do in the future.,150,,
1066,0.97,8831.322,8831.923,No problem.,151,,
1067,0.97,8831.923,8842.099,"Essentially what it is, feel free to copy and paste the link and watch on your own.",151,,
1068,0.97,8842.099,8853.711,But they are turbines that you install directly into drinking or wastewater pipelines . What you see in that top picture is the turbine itself.,151,,
1069,0.97,8853.711,8879.937,And you have yourself a 24/7 source of renewable greenhouse gas free energy that can be put onto the grid and hopefully phase out 30% of our energy that comes out of fossil fuels.,151,,
1070,0.97,8879.937,8897.955,Laces like Portland and up and down the West Coast from Oregon to California have begun installing these in their water pipelines and other countries around the world from South Africa and some European countries . go ahead and go to the next slide.,151,,
1071,0.97,8897.955,8906.497,"Lastly as has been mentioned a few times now, everybody knows the issue and the problem.",151,,
1072,0.97,8906.497,8909.967,We know we need to reduce Seattle's greenhouse gas emissions.,151,,
1073,0.97,8909.967,8929.687,"But the really needs to be an investment into the infrastructure whether it be renewable energy sources, transportation, housing, etc.",151,,
1074,0.97,8929.687,8938.796,". As Councilmember Sawant already mentioned, and increase into the Amazon Jumpstart tax.",151,,
1075,0.97,8938.796,8946.804,The slide was from when it was passed over the summer time and 9% is slated for green new deal.,151,,
1076,0.97,8946.804,8954.245,We know we will absolutely need that and more to meet Seattle's goals of greenhouse gas emissions reduction.,151,,
1077,0.97,8954.245,8959.917,And I will pass it over to Jess.,151,,
1078,0.97,8959.917,8964.021,Thanks matt and Debolina.,152,,
1079,0.97,8964.021,8970.728,"If I could get the night the next slide, thanks.",152,,
1080,0.97,8970.728,8983.874,We are not a whole board here today so I'm speaking on behalf of 350 Seattle and we are excited to take this to the full oversight board when we began meeting.,153,,
1081,0.97,8983.874,8987.011,As you can see from the slide we are going to talk about affordable housing.,153,,
1082,0.97,8987.011,8994.251,Battles housing crisis is pushing folks out of the city and all of this extra driving is driving up pollution.,153,,
1083,0.97,8994.251,9004.795,"As we heard last month, transportation is already our number 1 source of Greenhoue gas emissions and it only gets worse as folks are displaced.",153,,
1084,0.97,9004.795,9006.464,That displacement is not equal across the board.,153,,
1085,0.97,9006.464,9009.4,People of color and low income Úfolks are pushed out first and Furthest.,153,,
1086,0.97,9009.4,9018.009,Overwhelmingly young people who stay are rent burdened with over 40% of folks under 35 paying one third or more of their income to rent.,153,,
1087,0.97,9018.009,9028.619,A history of racist policies like Redlining and Exclusionary zoning have concentrated this displacement risk in communities of color.,153,,
1088,0.97,9028.619,9032.223,"Just like the climate crisis, Seattle's housing crisis hits communities of color and poor people first and worst.",153,,
1089,0.97,9032.223,9034.091,That is where we are starting.,153,,
1090,0.97,9034.091,9039.93,Next slide please . The good news is it doesn't have to be that way.,153,,
1091,0.97,9039.93,9050.241,"When we can all live in the places where we work, go to school, shop and connect with our communities we drive less which means our climate pollution SLOWS and our climate resilience grows.",153,,
1092,0.97,9050.241,9064.555,"This bar chart on the left shows how for San Francisco which is a city of similar size to Seattle, they are building more housing that has huge potential to reduce climate pollution.",153,,
1093,0.97,9064.555,9065.956,It is an essential climate strategy.,153,,
1094,0.97,9065.956,9074.865,When we invest in citywide Union built affordable housing we can create thousands of good jobs and build for our community.,153,,
1095,0.97,9074.865,9080.171,Most importantly we reduce our climate dilution while building resilience.,153,,
1096,0.97,9080.171,9092.249,Keeping communities in place protects the community connection that can make a life or death difference through crises like Covid-19 and also heat waves and Wildfire smoke that keep coming back year after year.,153,,
1097,0.97,9092.249,9101.692,"That said, as Debolina talked about in the community based research that has been done, it is not enough to talk about housing alone.",153,,
1098,0.97,9101.692,9108.466,Affordable housing if it displaces communities that undermines our efforts to reduce pollution and build resilience.,153,,
1099,0.97,9108.466,9113.971,We also have to talk about Anti- displacement strategies whenever we are talking about affordable housing.,153,,
1100,0.97,9113.971,9122.079,Things like community control development and land trust that keep folks in place.,153,,
1101,0.97,9122.079,9137.228,"We want to couple housing with community led investments for healthy, resilient neighborhoods so that our neighbors can meet their basic needs, things like food, Childcare, community connection, places to play and shop . getting to work or school and do that with an easy and safe walk, bus or bike ride.",153,,
1102,0.97,9137.228,9143.134,These are things that reduce climate Aleutian and they make our lives better.,153,,
1103,0.97,9143.134,9148.839,Pollution and they make our lives better.,153,,
1104,0.97,9148.839,9149.44,That is interesting.,153,,
1105,0.97,9149.44,9152.91,It looks link for me.,153,,
1106,0.97,9152.91,9155.546,Looks blank for me.,153,,
1107,0.97,9155.546,9161.018,As you can see this is a great graphic.,153,,
1108,0.97,9161.018,9166.59,From the sideline Institute showing how Portland Innovated to make more and more affordable options for housing.,153,,
1109,0.97,9166.59,9172.663,Portland is just one of many cities that is tackling climate pollution and the housing crisis by expanding what is possible.,153,,
1110,0.97,9172.663,9190.08,"We can learn from what worked when it comes to Rezoning when it comes to Minneapolis, Boston and Vancouver BC and we can learn a lot from community led development projects like the Homestead community land trust here or the East Bay permanent real estate cooperative in Oakland.",153,,
1111,0.97,9190.08,9207.164,I want to share this as a great example of what affordable housing could look like and how many options we have for density if we think about filling in existing neighborhoods in addition to the up selling or building up model that we have right now.,153,,
1112,0.97,9207.164,9218.309,I just want to close out and chair for my own experience as an individual as well as a representative and community Organizer for 350 Seattle but I will bring to the oversight board.,153,,
1113,0.97,9218.309,9220.21,I am a Renter like 54% of Seattle residents.,153,,
1114,0.97,9220.21,9222.212,I live in green Lake near the commercial center.,153,,
1115,0.97,9222.212,9229.687,What my roommate and I Jokingly call the up house.,153,,
1116,0.97,9229.687,9233.524,We are a falling down house that is surrounded by new apartment buildings that rent for double what we pay.,153,,
1117,0.97,9233.524,9237.995,When our house gets sold for development we will have to leave the neighborhood where we have been routed for years.,153,,
1118,0.97,9237.995,9243.934,This is my home but I live here with this lurking question of how long can I stay?,153,,
1119,0.97,9243.934,9246.637,I am not alone.,153,,
1120,0.97,9246.637,9255.446,The Seattle times reported recently that 45% of Seattle Millennial's think they will have to move somewhere cheaper to afford the life they want even though nearly all would prefer to stay in Seattle.,153,,
1121,0.97,9255.446,9275.165,"To bring it all for full circle, when young folks, poor folks and folks of color move out of the city, we still come back for work, school, families, communities and all that extra driving is driving up climate pollution.",153,,
1122,0.97,9275.165,9277.568,And it makes us less resilient in the face of climate chaos.,153,,
1123,0.97,9277.568,9284.074,Things like heat waves and Wildfire smoke because those critical community connections have been displaced and disrupted.,153,,
1124,0.97,9284.074,9299.757,The choices that we make today will shape our city for decades to come . Seattle needs housing and a citywide Buildout of affordable housing coupled with strong Anti-Displacement measures and investments in healthy resilient neighborhoods is a powerful green new deal solution.,153,,
1125,0.97,9299.757,9302.192,I will pass it over to Deepa.,153,,
1126,0.97,9302.192,9303.46,Thanks so much.,153,,
1127,0.97,9303.46,9307.298,Thank you Ted for moving to the next slide.,154,,
1128,0.97,9307.298,9316.407,I just want to mention that I am not on the green new deal oversight board so I will be speaking on behalf of climate solutions.,154,,
1129,0.97,9316.407,9320.377,I want to finish by tying everything together into the issue.,154,,
1130,0.97,9320.377,9334.892,We heard from Debolina about energy justice and matt about Fracking gas and affordable housing.,154,,
1131,0.97,9334.892,9353.043,We build housing that is meant for folks of all communities to be able to live in and we want to know that those buildings are clean and safe for them to stay in.,154,,
1132,0.97,9353.043,9357.047,It is responding to the fact that we need to stop using fossil fuels to heat and power our building.,154,,
1133,0.97,9357.047,9372.463,"As you heard, the building emissions have been rising every year and we are not on track as a city to reach our goals for reductions of emissions by 2030.",154,,
1134,0.97,9372.463,9377.401,Buildings are the second highest source of emissions in Seattle and the fastest growing's stores source statewide.,154,,
1135,0.97,9377.401,9383.24,That is due to using Fracked gas to heat and power our buildings.,154,,
1136,0.97,9383.24,9389.379,We have the benefit in Seattle of having really clean electricity.,154,,
1137,0.97,9389.379,9400.491,Seattle has 95% clean electricity and offsets the rest by purchasing allowances and in Washington as a whole we are moving toward cleaner electricity sources because of the 2019 clean energy act.,154,,
1138,0.97,9400.491,9410.134,It is crucial that we stop using fossil fuels and shift over to the source of energy that will be clean and renewable.,154,,
1139,0.97,9410.134,9422.546,"Next slide please . similar to what Debolina mentioned, air pollution is a big concern for using Fracked gas in our buildings.",154,,
1140,0.97,9422.546,9424.681,This is true indoors and outdoors.,154,,
1141,0.97,9424.681,9435.626,"Combusting gas releases dangerous Pollutions which have a number of respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological impacts.",154,,
1142,0.97,9435.626,9445.903,Children who grow up in a home with a gas stove where Pollutants are coming and harming our indoor air pollution.,154,,
1143,0.97,9445.903,9451.108,Children who grow up in those homes have a 42% increased risk of experiencing asthma symptoms.,154,,
1144,0.97,9451.108,9457.548,And this pollution is contributing to outdoor air pollution.,154,,
1145,0.97,9457.548,9461.585,Washington's residential appliances release more than two times as much Nitrous oxide as all of Washington's gas power plants combined.,154,,
1146,0.97,9461.585,9467.958,There are significant impacts.,154,,
1147,0.97,9467.958,9485.776,I want to frame this by saying air pollution disproportionately impacts black indigenous Asian and Latin next communities as well is low income communities as well as historical legacies of Redlining and segregation that have forced these communities into areas with the worst air pollution.,154,,
1148,0.97,9485.776,9491.748,Those communities have less access to Healthcare once they are experiencing health impacts from air pollution.,154,,
1149,0.97,9491.748,9508.365,And this has only gotten worse during the Covid crisis where we have heard about disproportionate burden of Covid on those communities and small increases in exposure to these Pollutants was correlated with higher death rate from Covid.,154,,
1150,0.97,9508.365,9515.906,This last year has been a stark reminder of how much we need to make sure that our pollution is reduced.,154,,
1151,0.97,9515.906,9518.675,Next slide please.,154,,
1152,0.97,9518.675,9521.211,There is also the safety risk.,155,,
1153,0.97,9521.211,9527.317,I have some Stats here but there is really interesting framing.,155,,
1154,0.97,9527.317,9532.923,If you think about what matt was saying about man camps and the Fracked gas sites.,155,,
1155,0.97,9532.923,9542.032,Along with safety along the gas pipelines you have those risks and risk to workers themselves that start at the point of extraction.,155,,
1156,0.97,9542.032,9553.644,Then you have the transmission of the gas through huge pipelines that go underneath communities and have risks of leaks that can contaminate the water supply.,155,,
1157,0.97,9553.644,9574.665,You have the risk of earthquakes and the risk at the point of use when gas goes into distribution pipelines and has a risk of leaking or causing fires or explosion in neighborhoods.,155,,
1158,0.97,9574.665,9582.673,We had a fire underground in the central district that required Evacuations to make sure that everyone was safe.,155,,
1159,0.97,9582.673,9587.244,In Seattle we had an explosion in 2016.,155,,
1160,0.97,9587.244,9592.883,I also want to note that we are always at risk of another gas leak or explosion even though we hear about the individual cases where that happens.,155,,
1161,0.97,9592.883,9597.354,We looked at the 911 records that are available for Seattle.,155,,
1162,0.97,9597.354,9615.005,And a resident called 911 an average of every three days about a suspected gas leak or odor which is remarkable that most gas customers would call their utility first and don't call 911.,155,,
1163,0.97,9615.005,9616.473,Gas really is an issue of safety.,155,,
1164,0.97,9616.473,9622.679,And earthquake risk makes us vulnerable.,155,,
1165,0.97,9622.679,9633.49,"Highly Pressurized gas pipelines run a risk of exploding during earthquakes and on the other side have any kind of disaster, electricity is much easier to restore than a broken pipeline in the aftermath of the disaster.",155,,
1166,0.97,9633.49,9635.392,Next slide please.,155,,
1167,0.97,9635.392,9644.301,The good news is that Electrification is a solution that provides a lot of benefits.,156,,
1168,0.97,9644.301,9650.207,It includes Technologies that are readily available in market these days that are more and more affordable.,156,,
1169,0.97,9650.207,9666.757,In this study from the rocky mountain Institute it shows that all electric buildings in Seattle can save money both Upfront and across the Lifecycle of 50 years and it can save a new home 28 tons of Co2 emissions over a 15 year period.,156,,
1170,0.97,9666.757,9680.27,"I want to tie this back to what Debolina was saying in the beginning about energy burdens on residents, especially those who live in homes that have not been Weatherized or have appliances that are not efficient.",156,,
1171,0.97,9680.27,9686.176,Currently electricity is more expensive than natural gas as an energy source.,156,,
1172,0.97,9686.176,9698.055,"But the appliances that we have, the High-Efficiency heat pumps and water heaters save so much energy that we are going to be seeing savings on our energy bills.",156,,
1173,0.97,9698.055,9703.994,And that will go down even more as more and more people come onto the grid with all electric homes.,156,,
1174,0.97,9703.994,9716.64,"Finally, the clean energy transformation act requires that low income folks can receive assistance for their heating bills if they use electricity while gas customers don't have protections.",156,,
1175,0.97,9716.64,9721.111,There is a lot of good news in terms of the cost and how we can save money.,156,,
1176,0.97,9721.111,9725.816,This is mostly with new buildings.,156,,
1177,0.97,9725.816,9728.185,There will be different conversations for existing buildings.,156,,
1178,0.97,9728.185,9733.023,Even for existing buildings those energy bill benefits will hold.,156,,
1179,0.97,9733.023,9741.731,Next slide please.,156,,
1180,0.97,9741.731,9745.635,I just want to finish by talking about some of the policies and current efforts of Electrification.,156,,
1181,0.97,9745.635,9750.107,In California we have seen a number of cities who have passed ordinances to have clean new buildings.,156,,
1182,0.97,9750.107,9762.052,And for Seattle we are pleased to note that Seattle passed a commercial energy update in January that did this for commercial and large multi family buildings.,156,,
1183,0.97,9762.052,9764.554,We need to make sure that is extended to all new buildings.,156,,
1184,0.97,9764.554,9773.663,We need to make sure that public utilities have the ability to offer incentives for switching from gas or oil to electricity.,156,,
1185,0.97,9773.663,9781.838,That is currently a state-level problem but we are happy the city of Seattle has continuously advocated for that at the state level.,156,,
1186,0.97,9781.838,9785.142,And the big question we need to think about is funding for existing building Retrofits.,156,,
1187,0.97,9785.142,9805.796,We are going to need to provide direct support probably to low income communities to fund those and we need to think about incentives or rebates for other homeowners who could afford it but we want to Incentivize them to do that.,156,,
1188,0.97,9805.796,9808.465,I'm going to skip these because I know we are short on time.,156,,
1189,0.97,9808.465,9820.01,There is a lot of movement happening on restricting gas and at the same time we need bolder action and we need to make sure that we are on track to meet our emissions goals that we set . I will close there.,156,,
1190,0.97,9820.01,9821.645,Thank you so much for your time.,156,,
1191,0.97,9821.645,9824.214,Thank you all.,157,,
1192,0.97,9824.214,9829.886,I'm really impressed by the amount of ground you all covered in such a short time.,157,,
1193,0.97,9829.886,9833.123,Those were very well laid out slides.,157,,
1194,0.97,9833.123,9885.775,"And we are going to be delighted to share it with a broader group of people who may not be tuned in right now because it is during work hours but who would be very interested in this information . I think you all have acknowledged very important aspects of how climate crisis touches people's lives in different ways . and one of the points I appreciated was from Debolina health focusing on public transit is not only an energy justice and climate justice issue but you look at the statistics, it is focusing on expanding public transit it is what is needed to address the climate crisis as a whole.",157,,
1195,0.97,9885.775,9890.046,It shows that those two goals are not in conflict with one another.,157,,
1196,0.97,9890.046,9899.389,Addressing the climate crisis as a whole goes Hand-In-Hand with focusing on energy justice because that is where the most immediate problems lie.,157,,
1197,0.97,9899.389,9901.591,There is no question that needs to be done.,157,,
1198,0.97,9901.591,9906.696,It is really about scale.,157,,
1199,0.97,9906.696,9914.204,"To convince ordinary people they need to use public transit, we have seen the Statistics there.",157,,
1200,0.97,9914.204,9918.108,People want to use it but people want to know what options are available.,157,,
1201,0.97,9918.108,9920.11,It has to be expanded.,157,,
1202,0.97,9920.11,9921.478,We need bold solutions.,157,,
1203,0.97,9921.478,9946.903,"And one of the things I want to draw out which a lot of the Presenters know that we learn from the greenhouse gas emissions report which the committee reviewed last month that matt reference, that Fracked gas and oil account for 45% of energy used to heat and cool Seattle buildings.",157,,
1204,0.97,9946.903,9952.208,That is good but they account for a staggering 91% of building emissions.,157,,
1205,0.97,9952.208,9955.445,That is reported by the office of Sustainability and environment.,157,,
1206,0.97,9955.445,9972.862,The report also noted that Seattle has to reduce building transportation and other forms of pollution at 17 times the current production rate over the next nine years to be able to reach the cities 2030 pollution reduction goals which are not ambitious.,157,,
1207,0.97,9972.862,9975.565,They are the bare minimum that is necessary.,157,,
1208,0.97,9975.565,9982.072,In the beginning it used to be top to bottom ambitious but we are talking about survival here.,157,,
1209,0.97,9982.072,9990.18,This is the bare minimum that is necessary that needs to be done.,157,,
1210,0.97,9990.18,9994.084,I think all of this is pointing towards the scale at which the solutions need to happen.,157,,
1211,0.97,9994.084,9998.288,Bold as you all have said and as I completely agree.,157,,
1212,0.97,9998.288,10006.062,The problem is that it is not happening right now and it is not just the city of Seattle.,157,,
1213,0.97,10006.062,10014.371,On the state level the failure to act is what we have talked loudly about.,157,,
1214,0.97,10014.371,10020.61,Statewide greenhouse gases increase in 2018 and remain level in the last decade.,157,,
1215,0.97,10020.61,10024.314,"So, you have shown a number of important priorities here.",157,,
1216,0.97,10024.314,10024.714,Very exciting.,157,,
1217,0.97,10024.714,10033.623,Something that will unite committee members and working to bring people together.,157,,
1218,0.97,10033.623,10047.637,"Given the reality that greenhouse gases are not declining right now and the fact that we are headed not in the right direction but over the climate change cliff, tell us about the scale of the action that you think the movement needs to be Demandin from the city and the state.",157,,
1219,0.97,10047.637,10050.306,Who should pay for the necessary investment?,157,,
1220,0.97,10050.306,10062.652,This is not a question of justice but the question of what is actually going to happen . If you want to reach the scale of the action we we need then who needs to pay for it?,157,,
1221,0.97,10062.652,10068.024,And what is the responsibility of Amazon and other major corporations?,157,,
1222,0.97,10068.024,10075.565,There are many other profitable corporations who gave millions during the pandemic.,157,,
1223,0.97,10075.565,10077.767,What is their obligation to pay for the investments we need?,157,,
1224,0.97,10077.767,10089.712,And in your view how can we begin to get there?,157,,
1225,0.97,10102.559,10106.362,Is someone going to respond?,157,,
1226,0.97,10106.362,10114.103,A tough question which is why I think we are all sitting here.,158,,
1227,0.97,10114.103,10116.306,I don't mean to put you on the spot.,159,,
1228,0.97,10116.306,10117.674,It is a matter of discussion obviously.,159,,
1229,0.97,10117.674,10132.388,I will Chime in and say that I don't have an answer on who has to pay although it absolutely cannot be community members who are in the communities most at risk.,160,,
1230,0.97,10132.388,10136.626,It has to be support from the government and through some progressive revenue.,160,,
1231,0.97,10136.626,10161.651,"But I do think that having a number of paired policies when addressing these issues of affordable housing and Anti- disc easement together and Weatherization and Electrification and solar ready houses, all of these things have to be going together because they are all similar goals and we need to make sure they are not pitted against each other.",160,,
1232,0.97,10161.651,10169.826,One of the things we faced in convert conversations around Electrification is builder saying that means we can't build because the cost of buildings will rise.,160,,
1233,0.97,10169.826,10177.467,We need to stand firm and say the benefits of a house without gas need to be there for affordable units as well.,160,,
1234,0.97,10177.467,10184.073,We can't have these priorities that are pitted against each other.,160,,
1235,0.97,10184.073,10192.482,Absolutely.,161,,
1236,0.97,10192.482,10208.298,In terms of the financing and funding I think we are all super cautious that the burden can't be placed on working families period.,161,,
1237,0.97,10208.298,10213.403,And progressive revenue in whatever form that can come.,161,,
1238,0.97,10213.403,10218.708,I personally would love to see an increase of big business tax.,161,,
1239,0.97,10218.708,10223.58,"I apologize, I am still at work.",161,,
1240,0.97,10223.58,10228.017,Janitorial service in the background if I'm getting drowned out.,161,,
1241,0.97,10228.017,10235.024,That would be one potential solution to look at.,161,,
1242,0.97,10235.024,10252.008,"I will add that I think we have opportunities to continue making sure that any Federal stimulus funds for infrastructure investments for economy building priorities, as that moves to local governments that we are making strategic investments.",162,,
1243,0.97,10252.008,10258.514,What are the intersections of everyday needs in our communities and reducing climate pollution.,162,,
1244,0.97,10258.514,10267.724,"Everything we have talked about here tonight whether energy justice or affordable housing or making sure that the air we breathe every day is clean, these are all things that take care of our communities now.",162,,
1245,0.97,10267.724,10274.03,And build toward a healthy climate future.,162,,
1246,0.97,10274.03,10284.34,Thinking about how do we maximize those investments as we see Federal stimulus funds will be really important and an opportunity for Seattle.,162,,
1247,0.97,10284.34,10291.948,Just echoing what everyone said . and I also wanted to elevate what matt said around progressive revenue.,163,,
1248,0.97,10291.948,10298.288,At least in Washington state low income communities are paying more than their share.,163,,
1249,0.97,10298.288,10305.595,We have a state tax but not an income tax and it is disproportionate to say the least.,163,,
1250,0.97,10305.595,10314.604,Echoing also the stimulus funds and where they need to go and which targeted communities they need to be invested in.,163,,
1251,0.97,10314.604,10318.675,That needs to be looked at.,163,,
1252,0.97,10318.675,10322.912,I had another point in my mind and I'm totally Blanking out.,163,,
1253,0.97,10322.912,10325.315,I'm totally Blanking out.,163,,
1254,0.97,10325.315,10329.419,I will remember later on.,163,,
1255,0.97,10329.419,10332.221,"Oh yes, Oh yes, now I remember.",163,,
1256,0.97,10332.221,10352.041,There are quite a few policies that come to us and a lot of those policies suggest revenue systems which are based on the same Extractive mechanisms.,163,,
1257,0.97,10352.041,10376.766,Very publicly Puget sound Sage has come out against the tap and trade policy good that got passed in the state and we do not think that is a system where revenues would be collected by extracting and making fossil fuel investors did away with Polluting and bringing that revenue into investment and other infrastructure.,163,,
1258,0.97,10376.766,10386.275,"So, thinking about progressive revenue systems over those Extractive revenue systems is something that would be more important for me and for Sage.",163,,
1259,0.97,10386.275,10386.642,Absolutely.,164,,
1260,0.97,10386.642,10390.179,I think that is very important.,164,,
1261,0.97,10390.179,10404.193,I think the terminology really captures the difference in how the extraction and expectation that the most marginalized communities and working people as a whole face on so many fronts.,164,,
1262,0.97,10404.193,10405.294,It is natural resources.,164,,
1263,0.97,10405.294,10409.465,It is the same thing that is happening in so many countries.,164,,
1264,0.97,10409.465,10410.399,This is a global issue.,164,,
1265,0.97,10410.399,10432.388,"You can see the Landgrab happening in so many countries and communities in India for example, our home country so many communities have been devastated because the places where they have been for generations have been taken away from them because of the need to extract.",164,,
1266,0.97,10432.388,10441.13,It is the endless need of capitalism to extract natural resources over and over again and it never ends.,164,,
1267,0.97,10441.13,10459.816,"The picture that you had met, about the Fracking sites, that was really evocative and the connection between that and the man camps and the horrendous situation that women and girls and especially the indigenous community as a whole.",164,,
1268,0.97,10459.816,10464.62,And bringing that together with public safety issues with having gas.,164,,
1269,0.97,10464.62,10467.356,It is stunning.,164,,
1270,0.97,10467.356,10470.459,You all have heard me quote this because I use it in the last committee.,164,,
1271,0.97,10470.459,10495.184,One of the workers who inspects the gas lines has told us that it is scary for the workers there also because a lot of this is not maintained because the company that is Prioritizing profit wants to do the bare minimum and they maybe don't break the law but the fact is they don't do anywhere near enough that they need to do to keep things safe in general.,164,,
1272,0.97,10495.184,10509.999,"Even if they were doing the most inspections and replacements which they are not, even if they did just the idea of having the gas line is really scary.",164,,
1273,0.97,10509.999,10515.872,The advocacy for full Electrification is so crucial.,164,,
1274,0.97,10515.872,10518.674,I want to respect everyone's time and we have been here for a while.,164,,
1275,0.97,10518.674,10521.277,I want to also invite Councilmembers to ask or make comments.,164,,
1276,0.97,10521.277,10538.895,"Just one other question before I call on Councilmembers, we should also talking about the green new deal in context of jobs.",164,,
1277,0.97,10538.895,10550.239,I'm not saying that you should have an answer today and as I said before this is really having a discussion in our community and our movements.,164,,
1278,0.97,10550.239,10573.963,But what your organizations and maybe Deepa from climate solutions you might be able to provide some insight in addition to Sage and others is what your organizations be able to develop an estimate of how many jobs could be created or supported if the city were to move gas customers onto electricity?,164,,
1279,0.97,10573.963,10577.633,I can take that first.,165,,
1280,0.97,10577.633,10586.142,I think that we have some great information from fossil fuel transmissions that just came out.,165,,
1281,0.97,10586.142,10591.28,I'm not sure if it estimated the number of jobs that created but that is something we can look into.,165,,
1282,0.97,10591.28,10607.697,I think they had some really great conclusions about recommendations in terms of how to make this transition just and how to increase access for people of color and women in the workforce of energy.,165,,
1283,0.97,10607.697,10614.003,Jobs created now are disproportionately white men that are occupying them.,165,,
1284,0.97,10614.003,10626.115,There is a way that we need to be able to ensure access to both retraining and apprenticeship opportunities for folks of color and women.,165,,
1285,0.97,10626.115,10647.303,I will just add that one of the things to think about in regards to workforce development is thinking of how many jobs will be lost from fossil fuels and how many will be created from clean energy jobs.,165,,
1286,0.97,10647.303,10650.206,But the job losses from the impacts of climate change are not accounted for.,165,,
1287,0.97,10650.206,10656.245,Do we need to think about this realistically and think about how much of an impact climate change is already having on our workers and residents.,165,,
1288,0.97,10656.245,10661.751,"To answer your question, that is something we can look into certainly.",165,,
1289,0.97,10661.751,10664.02,That would be really great.,166,,
1290,0.97,10664.02,10670.326,That is a concrete thing that we can present.,166,,
1291,0.97,10670.326,10686.942,I don't know if we can do a similar thing with the point that one of you talked about with housing and the contractors will tell you if you Electrify it will increase the cost.,166,,
1292,0.97,10686.942,10691.514,Obviously the question of profit versus people is the question.,166,,
1293,0.97,10691.514,10710.666,"But I think studies show that actually on the whole if you don't read it as actual cost to the community, it is much, much better to do electrifying.",166,,
1294,0.97,10710.666,10719.408,"That argument from contractors, that reminds me of bosses who say we can have our workers Unionize because our costs will go up.",166,,
1295,0.97,10719.408,10725.681,Too bad maybe profits will go down but we need to do this for workers.,166,,
1296,0.97,10725.681,10726.515,Similarly for the community.,166,,
1297,0.97,10726.515,10727.149,We need to Electrify.,166,,
1298,0.97,10727.149,10741.13,This needs to be done area the cost should not be put on working people who maybe rent or if they are well-off enough to buy an apartment . I think those points are important.,166,,
1299,0.97,10741.13,10744.133,Those Statistics that you could get us would be really beneficial.,166,,
1300,0.97,10744.133,10744.7,Thank you.,167,,
1301,0.97,10744.7,10752.241,I did want to let folks know that we will present the fossil fuel study report in my committee.,167,,
1302,0.97,10752.241,10757.046,We had hoped to hear that report in March.,167,,
1303,0.97,10757.046,10758.647,Maybe even February.,167,,
1304,0.97,10758.647,10776.665,But we realized or the Department realized that there was a sector missing from the study on the impacts of jobs and what kind of jobs should be included.,167,,
1305,0.97,10776.665,10779.535,So we had to send them back to the drawing board on that.,167,,
1306,0.97,10779.535,10791.914,But we will be hearing that in Committee on May 18 and I'm looking forward to being able to connect the dots here for some of the things you have been talking about.,167,,
1307,0.97,10791.914,10801.757,I was also wondering if you are able to make your presentation available . It is not on the agenda and we would love to be able to review it and get back to you.,167,,
1308,0.97,10801.757,10806.195,We will definitely put it up as well.,168,,
1309,0.97,10806.195,10814.103,And make sure that happens.,168,,
1310,0.97,10814.103,10816.105,Thank you Councilmember morale us.,168,,
1311,0.97,10816.105,10822.211,I don't see any virtual hands up by other Councilmembers.,168,,
1312,0.97,10822.211,10832.121,This is a huge issue and I have lots of questions and comments and points for discussion.,168,,
1313,0.97,10832.121,10839.495,". Presenters, do you want to make some closing comments before we close?",168,,
1314,0.97,10839.495,10841.63,I will be brief.,169,,
1315,0.97,10841.63,10848.037,The two thank all of you for the opportunity to share today.,169,,
1316,0.97,10848.037,10857.513,I look forward to working with all of you on some of these bold ideas and efforts moving forward.,169,,
1317,0.97,10857.513,10861.016,Thank you.,170,,
1318,0.97,10861.016,10871.093,We look forward to connecting with you both off-line and in the upcoming committees . I think concrete things of how to move forward.,170,,
1319,0.97,10871.093,10875.864,"And Deepa, you made an important point.",170,,
1320,0.97,10875.864,10878.0,We don't have the time to be sequential.,170,,
1321,0.97,10878.0,10883.672,We need a lot of these things to be moving very quickly.,170,,
1322,0.97,10883.672,10894.884,"Public transit expansion, Electrification, affordable housing expansion, all of that is necessary and encouraging.",170,,
1323,0.97,10894.884,10896.986,I really want to thank you all for your patience.,170,,
1324,0.97,10896.986,10901.59,Especially you Presenters because you had to wait for the other items to be done.,170,,
1325,0.97,10901.59,10904.393,Obviously in my mind they are not separate.,170,,
1326,0.97,10904.393,10915.304,Renters rights go along with environmental justice as well.,170,,
1327,0.97,10915.304,10923.712,"Jess, you talked about being a Renter yourself and how it is always looming on the horizon for Renters that you don't have housing stability because of the way things are.",170,,
1328,0.97,10923.712,10938.06,That does relate to the climate crisis because you get pushed further off and not having public transit expansion so there are tentacles everywhere.,170,,
1329,0.97,10938.06,10947.736,I appreciate you all for your patience and knowledge that you shared . I appreciate Councilmembers staying through the whole committee.,170,,
1330,0.97,10947.736,10954.31,I know is not the shortest committee but sometimes this has to happen because the these are important issues to discuss.,170,,
1331,0.97,10954.31,10961.95,I wanted to end by saying that we need those board solutions urgently.,170,,
1332,0.97,10961.95,10964.219,We appreciate everyone's time and patience.,170,,
1333,0.97,10964.219,10969.925,If there are no other comments I will go ahead and adjourn the meeting.,170,,
1334,0.97,10969.925,10976.198,Thank you all so much.,170,,
