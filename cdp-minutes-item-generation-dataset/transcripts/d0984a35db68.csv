135,0.97,1450.849,1469.968,"But Transitioning, it's apparent to me that law enforcement, community leaders, my colleagues at the Council, and government officials, it's a necessary part of our strategy but it alone will not be sufficient for the lasting change in the corridor.",3,,

141,0.97,1506.371,1523.021,"This presence is why, I want to be clear, why officers were able to respond to the shooting on Wednesday within 15 seconds and why without a doubt lives were saved, and many victims were able to receive care and response.",3,,
142,0.97,1523.021,1545.777,"And on a daily basis, those police hours are a resource to the residents and visitors of downtown but a response based solely in the presence of police officers is not going to lead to reducing the trauma, the public health investments and the community organizing that is necessary for lasting change in the corridor.",3,,
143,0.97,1545.777,1548.58,We have to be really clear about that.,3,,
144,0.97,1548.58,1553.251,"Today, I issued a statement, and everyone should have received it.",3,,

150,0.97,1598.763,1617.649,The second is engaging with communities and neighborhoods and maintain communication and build trust to make sure that we are engaging in bringing folks together and that we have officials that are trained to do that.,3,,
151,0.97,1617.649,1632.397,And their third role which I think is important especially given my previous job as a Prosecutor and has seen the impact of the programs is community service officers help to support the programs.,3,,

153,0.97,1654.486,1685.417,I think Councilmember Herbold mentioned programs that I worked with when I was an assistant city attorney and saw firsthand the impact and people making choices in their lives and getting resources in a sense of self have been extremely Impactful due to long- term trauma and violence we have seen in the past couple weeks.,3,,
154,0.97,1685.417,1700.098,Any way to further help work and elevate the work of these organizations in the Pike pine corridor is a step in the right direction.,3,,

156,0.97,1702.267,1736.434,"I want to be clear having discussed the community service officer program I am calling on this to complement not to replace the sworn officer patrols in the corridor but the community officers that form a public and open community are a new inter intervention, a new approach over the last civil years in this corridor.",3,,

204,0.97,2201.199,2205.603,This reduces our emergency services in Ballard.,5,,
205,0.97,2205.603,2234.532,"Having been a long time user of the health and emergency 70s at Ballard Swedish, the relationship this is so troubling is if an individual was to arrive at the emergency room expecting emergency services, they would not Bably to have the services provided whether that I would have to travel through the University district or Harborview unless you are in an aide car, getting to Harborview was difficult.",5,,

210,0.97,2261.559,2266.497,The cost of using an aid car is so high just to get the services you need.,5,,
211,0.97,2266.497,2271.602,We need the emergency room open in Ballard for the residents of our community.,5,,

231,0.97,2418.916,2439.87,"While the Legislature makes more minor adjustments to the Bi-Annual budget in the form of a supplemental budget much is focused on transportation with the passage of I-976, continuing the good work around gun responsibility, housing, shelter, and behavioral health.",10,,
232,0.97,2439.87,2460.691,The governor's bottom as many of you know included over $300 00 million with reducing homelessness by 50% in the next two years and housing assistance and shelter capacities.,10,,
233,0.97,2460.691,2470.868,"While many legislators on both sides of the aisle think is a priority issue, many agree with the governor this is requiring emergency action.",10,,
234,0.97,2470.868,2475.005,And there are still strong opinions on the rainy day Funs.,10,,
235,0.97,2475.005,2480.144,Where the funds should be focused is a discussion that we will continue on.,10,,
236,0.97,2480.144,2485.015,Some folks are saying that a one-time boost won't solve the problems.,10,,
237,0.97,2485.015,2486.116,This is ongoing.,10,,
238,0.97,2486.116,2492.923,We will continue to monitor those discussions and report back.,10,,
239,0.97,2492.923,2502.099,Y will turn it over to page one in the couple bulletin and go section by section and go over any points.,10,,

246,0.97,2523.454,2523.821,Thanks.,12,,
247,0.97,2523.821,2525.256,But it was canceled.,13,,
248,0.97,2525.256,2531.328,The bill came out and was passed again and now is in the hands of the committee.,13,,
249,0.97,2531.328,2541.105,There was a similar bill last year that stalled due to lack of Bi-Partisan support but it's widely believed there will be a bill.,13,,
250,0.97,2541.105,2545.876,We will continue to track and report on the progress.,13,,
251,0.97,2545.876,2562.459,The next is for Menstrual products to be proceeded in school and join Illinois and New Hampshire and New York with the passage of the bill.,13,,
252,0.97,2562.459,2568.032,"There is a lot of interest in the bill, and it has gotten a fair amount of publicity.",13,,
253,0.97,2568.032,2576.34,"While everyone seems to be in support, it's an Upfunded mandate in the schools, and there was some concern expressed about that.",13,,
254,0.97,2576.34,2580.778,"And moving on to the environment, I will hand it over to Quinn.",14,,
255,0.97,2580.778,2586.85,"In the field of environment, there are a few pieces of legislation we are tracking.",15,,
256,0.97,2586.85,2598.629,"The first is House bill 1110, concerning greenhouse gases and transportation fuels, more commonly known as the low carbon fuel standard.",15,,
257,0.97,2598.629,2626.724,"This is a major issue for the governor, and it would direct the State Department of Ecology to adopt rules to reduce the intensity of the carbon emissions of 10% 2028 and 30% by 2035, and it would create credits for low carbon intensity and benefit our fuels here in Seattle.",15,,
258,0.97,2626.724,2638.469,This passed through the house and made it through the Senate committee but did not make it Throughthe full House.,15,,
259,0.97,2638.469,2651.048,"It's back in the agenda, and it could potentially move as early as this week but it can be somewhat difficult to predict the schedule in the House but it could be next week.",15,,
260,0.97,2651.048,2655.786,"Next up is House bill 23-10, another governor priority.",15,,
261,0.97,2655.786,2687.017,This regards the reduction of emissions from On-Demand transportation services specifically companies as well as in the initial form of the food service deliveries that operate through Out-Based services and delivery of food.,15,,
262,0.97,2687.017,2703.934,"There will be a committee vote tomorrow, and that proposed will remove goods delivery which was an A.A Mbitious part of the proposal.",15,,
263,0.97,2703.934,2729.66,It would include several changes including requiring companies to submit plans to include an action plan to make sure that the reductions don't hurt low-income operators of the vehicles and allow for companies to submit plans through Ecology to receive credit for Electricification infrastructure.,15,,
264,0.97,2729.66,2738.001,"Just to be clear, this bill is likely to be focused on the transportation of people and not delivery services associated with food and goods?",16,,
265,0.97,2738.001,2743.474,It still includes the delivery of food.,17,,
266,0.97,2743.474,2747.611,So things like grub Hub but no longer includes goods.,17,,
267,0.97,2747.611,2750.28,All right.,18,,
268,0.97,2750.28,2750.814,Thank you.,18,,
269,0.97,2750.814,2752.149,Yeah.,19,,
270,0.97,2752.149,2777.274,"And moving on to house bill 24- 5 this is the community Property/Clean energy, a full title of this proposed program, the community poverty assessment and clean energy program, and this would create's new program for local government.",19,,
271,0.97,2777.274,2798.262,It's similar to an lid but smaller on the property scale allowing for improvements to be made to buildings that invest in emergency preparedness resilience to be funded through a special assessment by the local government or interested private party.,19,,
272,0.97,2798.262,2803.267,So this would be a permissive authorizing piece of legislation.,19,,
273,0.97,2803.267,2808.739,It's a priority for the office of emergency management and several other departments.,19,,
274,0.97,2808.739,2814.678,It was moved out of committee last week and continues to largely draw a positive reception.,19,,
275,0.97,2814.678,2815.012,Go ahead.,20,,
276,0.97,2815.012,2830.294,"I was going to say this bill is so important because within emergency management we have Upreinforced masonry, and so many buildings are Upreinforced.",21,,
277,0.97,2830.294,2843.674,Little known fact we are in a seismic zone and downtown Ballard also has Unreinforced buildings.,21,,
278,0.97,2843.674,2846.877,Making them Resillient and economically feasible is a fine line to walk.,21,,
279,0.97,2846.877,2856.687,I think this help in the area.,21,,
280,0.97,2856.687,2865.629,"Absolutely, and in her final time before retiring, she spent time there.",22,,
281,0.97,2865.629,2874.137,A hurdle last year when this came up during the legislative session was the state Association of treasurers.,23,,
282,0.97,2874.137,2883.013,Is that something that we have been able to address their concerns?,23,,
283,0.97,2883.013,2887.117,"I think it's--as Councilmember Strauss said, this is incredibly important.",23,,
284,0.97,2887.117,2893.457,There are more than 20 States nationally that have these kinds of programs.,23,,
285,0.97,2893.457,2912.075,Not only is a program like this really important to being able to--for our city to roll out Unreinforced masonry program but includes requirements to be com Compliant with the program.,23,,
286,0.97,2912.075,2926.223,"We have to develop the rules to ensure that the Stakeholders in property management, proper ownership, and property development communities are on board with us.",23,,
287,0.97,2926.223,2939.369,I will be really interested to know if there are barriers or hurdles or Oppositions like we experienced in the last state legislative session.,23,,
288,0.97,2939.369,2973.203,"This is a high priority for me as well and have been working with SBCI and office of planning and development on planning--and on some Much- needed changes to our Department rights program, and those changes are another--another financing option.",23,,
289,0.97,2973.203,2982.612,"But again, the costs of the program are enormous.",23,,
290,0.97,2982.612,2989.686,We will not Bably be be able to move forward.,23,,
291,0.97,2989.686,3001.498,"As I understand it, we have the Leadingests for the emergency management officers and fire chiefs and others to make contacts and have discussions to try and work on their concerns.",24,,
292,0.97,3001.498,3003.8,But I do understand it's an issue at this point.,24,,
293,0.97,3003.8,3010.44,That's one of the hurdles that still need to come over.,24,,
294,0.97,3010.44,3022.452,I would welcome an opportunity to look at off line and see if there is anything that we can do in order to address it.,25,,
295,0.97,3022.452,3023.553,Absolutely.,26,,
296,0.97,3023.553,3029.793,The final bill in the environmental category includes insurance.,26,,
297,0.97,3029.793,3039.036,This bill would address the pollution liability insurance agency to close out their existing program for heating oil pollution liability.,26,,
298,0.97,3039.036,3071.201,This is a program that helps homeowners who or property owners who have homes that use heating oil transition to more sustainable and safe heating methods in the event they have a leak or their tank becomes broken which could be a hazard for the property.,26,,
299,0.97,3071.201,3075.939,The Office of Sustainability has had concerned over this legislation.,26,,
300,0.97,3075.939,3089.92,"There are between 16,000 and 18,000 homes that use eating oil currently, and it can be a major cost burden for homeowners to make significant replacement and repair to their home.",26,,
301,0.97,3089.92,3121.985,The bill was moved out of the committee in the house and included an amend to include the insurance liability agency with rule making for the secondary program which would be the underground storage tank Loaner and grant program to provide support of loans and support of grant programs and Additionals with financial needs.,26,,
302,0.97,3121.985,3125.856,I think there are concerns on our part about the implications for the city.,26,,
303,0.97,3125.856,3127.39,I don't think we're there yet.,26,,
304,0.97,3127.39,3137.501,"We will continue working on the bill, but our friends at the state have shown an interest in making sure that the impacts for long-term individuals are mitigated.",26,,
305,0.97,3137.501,3139.669,We will continue to work on that.,26,,
306,0.97,3139.669,3147.377,"Thank you, Quinn, and moving over to page 2, we will go over to Cheryl with the general highlights.",27,,
307,0.97,3147.377,3156.52,We have civil bills related to tracking issues.,28,,
308,0.97,3156.52,3164.861,And please the us know if there are others that you are concerned about.,28,,
309,0.97,3164.861,3171.067,The first bill creates a grant for jurisdictions to provide greater access to residents.,28,,
310,0.97,3171.067,3187.117,Services such as health care and civic activity occur Online and not all residents have equal access.,28,,
311,0.97,3187.117,3193.456,A meeting is going to be held for the economic Committee on Wednesday.,28,,
312,0.97,3193.456,3203.733,Two bills address data privacy and facial recognition.,28,,
313,0.97,3203.733,3210.941,"It requires new rights to access, Delete, correct, and move their date or opt out of data.",28,,

315,0.97,3216.546,3230.86,"The controls are personal data of 100,000 can Assumers and more and knows that control data of 25,000 consumers or more than 50% of the revenue from the sale of personal data.",28,,
316,0.97,3230.86,3237.734,A measure passed the Senate last year before dying in the house.,28,,
317,0.97,3237.734,3248.445,"It requires judicial oversight and while both bills are supported by Microsoft, the legal communities have legal concerns about the bills and are opposed.",28,,
318,0.97,3248.445,3249.079,So we're monitoring these.,28,,
319,0.97,3249.079,3249.679,All right.,29,,
320,0.97,3249.679,3253.883,And moving on to the Healthcare and housing section.,29,,
321,0.97,3253.883,3254.117,Robin?,29,,
322,0.97,3254.117,3281.778,"I think in the interest of time, am not going on a bill by bill basis but I will say in the Healthcare area is a bill that would require prescription of Opioid Overdose reversal or Naloxone.",30,,
323,0.97,3281.778,3303.366,"We expect that the hearing will be scheduled, and the governor has a comprehensive bill on Vaping, and that includes House bill 24-54 and is scheduled for executive session this week on the 27th at 1:30, and it's quite a comprehensive way to address concerns around Vaping in our state.",30,,
324,0.97,3303.366,3308.905,"If anyone doesn't have questions on Healthcare, I'll move on to housing.",30,,
325,0.97,3308.905,3311.474,There are certainly many bills in the housing field.,30,,
326,0.97,3311.474,3320.817,I think many of you may have noted that the governor proposed a $300 million investment in homelessness in his budget.,30,,
327,0.97,3320.817,3324.888,That money would have come out of the rainy day Fund.,30,,
328,0.97,3324.888,3345.709,"I think that there is a pretty universal feeling that it won't be possible to get the majority that is needed to use those funds but I think legislators are interested in doing something, I think it will be much less of a scale than the governor was talking about.",30,,
329,0.97,3345.709,3351.314,We will watch the budget for that and get back to you on that.,30,,
330,0.97,3351.314,3357.954,The housing alliance in terms of budget this year has a rather modest trust fund.,30,,
331,0.97,3357.954,3378.041,"Last year, there was $175 million investment in the housing trust fund which was not the most but certainly the most significant investment that we've seen in receipt years . and we have a crisis of affordable housing and need to provide funding.",30,,
332,0.97,3378.041,3395.325,"This year, the trust fund, $10 million, is focused on preservation of buildings that will expire where the rent or income restrictions will expire.",30,,
333,0.97,3395.325,3398.394,"We will be facing certainly, many expiring buildings.",30,,
334,0.97,3398.394,3401.998,So starting to have a discussion about that is very important.,30,,
335,0.97,3401.998,3409.539,There are two other bills that are sort of connected to the preservation idea.,30,,
336,0.97,3409.539,3431.394,"One is a real estate excise tax exemption that would be provided if the sale of a property goes to non-profit developer and promise to keep it as affordable housing, so those two things go hand in hand.",30,,
337,0.97,3431.394,3436.132,I have promised Councilmember Herbold a list of all of those and will provide that as well.,30,,
338,0.97,3436.132,3440.57,Even though with the short session there are many things out there.,30,,
339,0.97,3440.57,3464.561,"One of those is House bill 1694 which would establish Tennant installments like Seattle, and another bill is the just cause Eviction bill which had a successful hearing on Friday morning, I understand, and is scheduled for executive session on the help Tost.",30,,
340,0.97,3464.561,3467.363,That's house bill 2453.,30,,
341,0.97,3467.363,3479.943,It's very similar to Seattle's just cause Eviction requirement but it also extends to month to month.,30,,
342,0.97,3479.943,3493.122,There is a significant amendment in the proposed bill that would help close a loophole in Seattle's just cause Eviction ordinance.,31,,
343,0.97,3493.122,3508.605,Although intended to cover not only month to month 10 ants during every month was originally intended to cover tenants at the end of their fixed -Term leases.,31,,
344,0.97,3508.605,3545.575,"Because of a lawsuit in 2000, the office of construction began enforcing the law differently and is Reverting to language in state law that Basicallys Fixed-Term contracts are over when thy're over and the tenant doesn't have a hold over right.",31,,
345,0.97,3545.575,3561.357,"The point was to end arbitrary Evictions are regardless of what your tenancy was based, month to month or contract.",31,,
346,0.97,3561.357,3585.415,And the just cause Eviction bill would not only Ex10 the just cause we had for 40 years but it would help us to close this really important loophole that if not closed has continued and will continue to allow for arbitrary Eviction of Tennants at the end of their fixed term leases.,31,,
347,0.97,3585.415,3589.786,"Thank you, and if there are no additional questions --",32,,
348,0.97,3589.786,3601.764,More of a statement than a question with this with housing and health care and health housing.,33,,
349,0.97,3601.764,3615.078,"We have a chronic under funding at the Federal level and following the state level, and that's putting a lot of the problems we are experiencing on the municipality back.",33,,
350,0.97,3615.078,3628.558,"We will get solutions if the state and Federal governments do not act, so thank you very much for your work in advocating for these solutions.",33,,
351,0.97,3628.558,3633.363,"Absolutely, and we are looking to Prioritize.",34,,
352,0.97,3633.363,3644.374,"1 thing to add to housing, the governor proposed changes which would include a 12-year extension which would address expiring units.",35,,
353,0.97,3644.374,3651.047,We have 850 units in the next 5 years that will expire in Seattle.,35,,
354,0.97,3651.047,3657.687,That's September bill 6411 and House bill 2620 which has not been scheduled for a hearing yet.,35,,
355,0.97,3657.687,3663.459,"There is robust discussions in Olympia about the bills, and we will keep you posted on that of the thank you.",35,,
356,0.97,3663.459,3717.647,"And beginning on page 5 you were public safety we are seeing mentions of several gun responsibility bills including a general request, legislation to ban assault weapons, high- capacity magazines, and also an effort resulting from last year's study bill to Centralize Washington's back ground check system as well as a Bell to repeal the local jurisdiction from regulating firearms, so local authority there, and then moving to safety and civil rights at the bottom of page 6, the representative for open court proposal has been introduced Piggybacking on what was so important to many Councilmembers last year, limiting data sharing with ice and Diswru additional warrants in the workplace.",36,,
357,0.97,3717.647,3738.067,"House bill 25 sketch will prohibit Warrantless civil arrests between a mile of the courthouse as the spike in courthouse arrests as I understand it has had a chilling effect on the most vulnerable members of the society, specifically victims of domestic violence.",36,,
358,0.97,3738.067,3742.872,And civil arrests would be prohibited without a court order under this bill.,36,,
359,0.97,3742.872,3769.298,"This is a major priority for many of our partners in the Imgrant community and working down page 6, a proposal aimed at reducing Harassment and employment discrimination for isolated workers.",36,,
360,0.97,3769.298,3778.307,The proposal that will work to Decriminalize driving with a suspended license due to unpaid types.,36,,
361,0.97,3778.307,3782.612,This is sometimes known as driving while poor.,36,,
362,0.97,3782.612,3815.044,"And Senate bill 6313 towards the bottom of page 6, a bill that would make voter registration opt out versus opt in as well as give 17 I don't recalls the ability to vote in the primary if they Turn'By turn--18 by the judgment--general election.",36,,
363,0.97,3815.044,3829.859,"And one of the gun control bills, one of them is a gun control bill that allows for the Confiscation of guns.",37,,
364,0.97,3829.859,3833.863,There is an intersection between gun ownership and Duis.,37,,
365,0.97,3833.863,3848.344,"Folks who have more than two Duis, local law enforcement can take their guns because there is a nexus between gun violence between suicide and Duis.",37,,
366,0.97,3848.344,3872.134,It's similar to our program as it relates to domestic violence and expands that analysis of the nexus between gun ownership and certain activities that makes someone more likely to engage in gun violence.,37,,
367,0.97,3872.134,3877.506,There is a proposal for folks Impacting trial or sentencing.,38,,
368,0.97,3877.506,3883.98,"So if folks are charged with that connection with, those protections are in place.",38,,
369,0.97,3883.98,3897.193,"But this is for people pending trial, convicted very--vehicular Homicide or a Dui, 3D Ui offense.",38,,
370,0.97,3897.193,3909.372,I think there was a lot of momentum for this with concern around the nexus develop violence and Dui convictions.,38,,
371,0.97,3909.372,3912.408,We will address that in the next report.,38,,
372,0.97,3912.408,3922.018,"If there is nothing else in the section, I will turn it over to Quinn to end with the transportation priorities.",38,,
373,0.97,3922.018,3927.623,"Finishing in transportation, there are two major pieces of legislation we are tracking.",39,,
374,0.97,3927.623,3937.533,The first is a bill that would expand the office for local governments for financing transportation.,39,,
375,0.97,3937.533,3943.406,It would provide new authority for sales tax and utility tax and a local gas tax.,39,,
376,0.97,3943.406,3948.311,This is something that the city is and interested in.,39,,
377,0.97,3948.311,3954.05,I will say it does have a bit of an uphill struggle this session.,39,,
378,0.97,3954.05,3960.389,A lot of legislators see this as tied to a broader state wide revenue package.,39,,
379,0.97,3960.389,3963.492,We are continuing to work this piece of legislation.,39,,
380,0.97,3963.492,3974.236,But it's likely that we will need to make this a multi-year effort in a broader conversation.,39,,
381,0.97,3974.236,3977.506,All right.,40,,
382,0.97,3977.506,3979.675,"Thank you, Quinn.",40,,

384,0.97,3994.29,4010.039,"It expire this year in Seattle, and we want to have the best option to renew that and happy to talk with you off line about what we are thinking about and talk about it in the committee as well.",40,,
385,0.97,4010.039,4012.308,We are not taking our chances.,40,,
386,0.97,4012.308,4015.177,We will make it a priority.,40,,
387,0.97,4015.177,4015.845,Thank you.,40,,

389,0.97,4024.887,4029.625,This remains a top priority for the city and the Department of transportation from last year.,41,,
390,0.97,4029.625,4044.673,"Last session, we were able to move it out of the house and out of Senate committee but Unfortunately, the Sente ran out of time.",41,,

392,0.97,4049.345,4059.455,We are continuing to work with senators and representatives and Stakeholders to work through a handful of issues related to the geographic scope.,41,,
393,0.97,4059.455,4068.864,"It was something that any city could do, sort of throughout the legislative process got pared down to the greater downtown Seattle.",41,,
394,0.97,4068.864,4086.649,We are working to preserve the most high priority areas expect continuing to work through issues around citation amounts and blocking the box and transit operations.,41,,
395,0.97,4086.649,4090.853,We remain hopeful and we are making good progress with the Stakeholders.,41,,
396,0.97,4090.853,4101.096,It's a positive sign we are getting a hearing in the Senate where we have traditionally struggled.,41,,
397,0.97,4101.096,4104.233,We are continuing to work the issue.,41,,
398,0.97,4104.233,4104.567,Stay tuned.,41,,
399,0.97,4104.567,4105.901,Just real quick.,42,,
400,0.97,4105.901,4114.276,"The block the box portion, is that the portion that is downtown or does it include the bus only lanes?",42,,
401,0.97,4114.276,4142.404,"So it's a little bit--without getting too deep into it, a little technical, it would be automated Enforcemnt for block the box and areas zoned downtown, .50 of a mile outside of that, Non-Interstate highways for 3 miles outside of that area and Arterials extending up to one mile outside of the Noninterstate notices.",43,,
402,0.97,4142.404,4143.139,"So, yes.",43,,
403,0.97,4143.139,4151.514,The legislature likes to make things slightly complicated at times.,43,,
404,0.97,4151.514,4155.751,But it's not being permitted to name the specific streets.,43,,
405,0.97,4155.751,4156.952,Have we mapped it?,44,,
406,0.97,4156.952,4162.258,We have mapped it.,45,,
