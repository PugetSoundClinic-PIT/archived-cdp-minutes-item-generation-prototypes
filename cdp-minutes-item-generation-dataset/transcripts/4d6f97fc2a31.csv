59,0.97,285.285,289.389,"In the budget and revenue space, last week we covered a lot of the salient highlights of the different budgets.",20,,
60,0.97,289.389,303.603,"In delivering the Council bulletin over the weekend, Hannah also provided a more in depth overview of the capital and operating budgets.",20,,
61,0.97,303.603,307.874,"Which in the interest of time, I think we are not going to go through item by item.",20,,
62,0.97,307.874,319.619,"If there any questions about particular items, we are happy to address those or look into them as Councilmembers are interested.",20,,
63,0.97,319.619,335.501,"In terms of the overall developments on the budgets, last week both the house and the Senate passed their proposals, their operating capital and transportation proposals on various days.",20,,
64,0.97,335.501,347.847,"Those are all now queued up for the budget leaders, the chairs, vice chairs, and drinking members, to begin negotiations across the chambers.",20,,
65,0.97,347.847,370.436,"Given the fact that there is a pretty significant amount of Federal resources available, as well as the continued improvement of the overall--the state's overall revenue forecast, I do believe that the budgets are not as far apart as they have been in previous years.",20,,
66,0.97,370.436,376.342,The starting point for negotiations should be a relatively good one.,20,,
67,0.97,376.342,378.878,There are differences that budget leaders will need to address.,20,,
68,0.97,378.878,387.687,"Both budgets, as Lily mentioned, to include the capital gains tax.",20,,
69,0.97,387.687,395.228,"Although that legislation has not specifically moved out of committee, the fact that it is Referenced in both budgets is a very positive development there.",20,,
70,0.97,395.228,414.514,"I think the only other legislation updates to note here in budget and revenue is that the wealth tax, House bill 1406, was passed out of the House Appropriations--sorry, the House Finance Committee, and is now in the Appropriations Committee.",20,,
71,0.97,414.514,418.985,This is a very positive step for this legislation.,20,,
72,0.97,418.985,423.623,"It had a public hearing much earlier in session, but has sort of since been dormant.",20,,
73,0.97,423.623,437.236,"I do think that it is probably unlikely that it will be adopted, passed both the house and Senate this year.",20,,
74,0.97,437.236,440.84,Seeing it move in continue to be part of the conversation is definitely a very positive development.,20,,
75,0.97,440.84,444.71,I will pause there for any questions on budget and revenue.,20,,
76,0.97,444.71,453.252,"Colleagues, any questions or comments on this section?",21,,
77,0.97,453.252,457.356,"Sorry, I had to Scroll.",21,,

83,0.97,473.639,480.58,I know that it has not been easy for those working on the outside and the inside Somma so thanks for all the great news and all of your incredible advocacy.,22,,
84,0.97,480.58,486.352,"Quinn, just interesting if you can breathe a brief highlight of any of the capital budget investments?",22,,
85,0.97,486.352,499.298,"I want to make an assumption we are talking mostly about operating, but is there anything you would like to lift up from capital, especially as it relates to transportation and bridges?",22,,
86,0.97,499.298,503.603,Certainly.,23,,
87,0.97,503.603,511.01,"Apologies, Councilmember Mosqueda, I was saving transportation for that section, but I'm happy to speak to that at this point.",23,,
88,0.97,511.01,532.532,"The current law transportation budget--I guess to frame this, while revenues and operating and capital to a lesser extent have really bounced back since the summer period where revenues were down significantly in the state's budget situation.",23,,
89,0.97,532.532,534.2,Transportation revenues have not bounced back.,23,,
90,0.97,534.2,544.911,"So, there is, in the transportation budget, just under $1 billion in shortfall.",23,,
91,0.97,544.911,554.654,"It is more than $1 billion when you factor in transportation revenues, but the Supreme Court's decision on 976 did restore about $300 million.",23,,
92,0.97,554.654,561.761,Both in the House-Senate Backfield that shortfall with funds from the American rescue plan.,23,,
93,0.97,561.761,567.667,The final sort of situation is very much a status quo.,23,,
94,0.97,567.667,571.737,When it comes to the current long transportation budgets.,23,,
95,0.97,571.737,578.177,"So, those budgets don't have any significant investments in bridges or infrastructure.",23,,
96,0.97,578.177,587.586,"That said, chair five, the House transportation chair did release a new law.",23,,
97,0.97,587.586,590.59,Transportation revenue package proposal last week.,23,,
98,0.97,590.59,601.801,That did include--we are Parsing through this and we will provide an updated summary of this as well.,23,,
99,0.97,601.801,608.708,"For Seattle specifically in terms of Seattle's specific investments, you will recall previously he didn't have a project list.",23,,
100,0.97,608.708,612.111,He did come out with a project list at this point.,23,,
101,0.97,612.111,614.18,That does include $25 million for the West Seattle bridge.,23,,
102,0.97,614.18,621.721,"$54 million for Ballard, which includes the Ballard and magnolia bridges.",23,,
103,0.97,621.721,626.926,$20 million for safety improvements in North Aurora.,23,,
104,0.97,626.926,638.938,"There has been a Long-Standing issue with pedestrian injuries, but including recently several collisions and fatalities there.",23,,
105,0.97,638.938,642.408,That is what is included specifically for Seattle projects on the House side.,23,,
106,0.97,642.408,652.518,"Then, on the Senate side, chair Hobbs is scheduled to release an update for his forward Washington proposal later today.",23,,
107,0.97,652.518,654.653,There will be a hearing on that tomorrow.,23,,
108,0.97,654.653,660.359,"In his previous version, he included $25 million for the West Seattle bridge.",23,,
109,0.97,660.359,672.938,"So, we will see what comes out there, and when we have that information I will provide a more detailed summary and comparison of those two, not just the Seattle projects but overall buckets of spending.",23,,
110,0.97,672.938,674.74,There are some significant differences there.,23,,
111,0.97,674.74,677.276,Thank you very much.,24,,
112,0.97,677.276,682.581,"All right, any other comments or questions on revenue?",25,,

116,0.97,693.826,701.267,"While both vehicles have been moving through so far, it has not been determined that the Senate bill will be the vehicle.",26,,
117,0.97,701.267,708.607,It was exec'd from appropriations last week and Hs been referred to rules.,26,,
118,0.97,708.607,711.677,It is fully funded in both versions of the budget.,26,,
119,0.97,711.677,714.513,"So, good news there.",26,,
120,0.97,714.513,723.823,All the remaining education bills we are following have made it out of their committees before last week's cut off and are now in rules.,26,,
121,0.97,723.823,726.092,"So, I'll pass it back to Quinn for environment.",26,,
122,0.97,726.092,731.397,"In the environment space, we have some good news and some bad news this week.",27,,
123,0.97,731.397,739.739,"And positive developments, House bill 1091, which is the clean fuel standard passed out of the ways and Means Committee.",27,,
124,0.97,739.739,742.741,It's a positive development.,27,,
125,0.97,742.741,746.212,Was referred directly to rules.,27,,
126,0.97,746.212,757.756,I think there was some conversation about whether it would go to the conversation Committee in the Senate which is the location would hasn't experienced some difficulties in previous years.,27,,
127,0.97,757.756,762.261,Which is not to say it doesn't still face some challenges on the Senate floor.,27,,
128,0.97,762.261,767.733,That is one obstacle that has existed in previous years that will not be an obstacle this year.,27,,
129,0.97,767.733,786.385,"Unfortunately, on the Flipside, House bill 1099, which would have incorporated planning for climate change into comprehensive planning and growth management policies, that was somewhat surprisingly, at least to me and two other advocates, after passing out of ways and means, referred to transportation.",27,,
130,0.97,786.385,795.761,"With only two before fiscal cutoff, it did receive a hearing but it was not voted out of committee before that deadline on Friday.",27,,
131,0.97,795.761,797.496,That bill is dead for this year.,27,,
132,0.97,797.496,803.502,I think our efforts to incorporate some of the provisions into other legislation.,27,,
133,0.97,803.502,812.611,"But, at least as a vehicle, 1099 is no longer active.",27,,

175,0.97,1096.195,1103.702,"The constitutional amendment that is needed to enact that exemption, hr 4204, also passed out of finance on Friday.",33,,
176,0.97,1103.702,1111.777,"Then, finally on the housing front, Senate bill 5160 passed out of the Appropriations Committee on Thursday.",33,,
177,0.97,1111.777,1124.823,"That includes legal representation for tenants, payment plans, and an increase in the amount that the landlords may receive from the landlord mitigation Fund.",33,,
178,0.97,1124.823,1131.93,All to provide a path forward after the Eviction moratorium is lifted.,33,,
179,0.97,1131.93,1137.669,That's all that I have for housing today if anyone has any questions before I move on to police reform I'll pause for a moment.,33,,
180,0.97,1137.669,1139.104,"Thanks, Robin for taking a pause.",34,,
181,0.97,1139.104,1141.44,I see that Councilmember Lewis has his hand raised.,34,,
182,0.97,1141.44,1142.508,Please.,34,,
183,0.97,1142.508,1148.747,I think this might be the appropriate time to ask this question about the budget related to housing matters.,35,,
184,0.97,1148.747,1160.159,My office through it takes a village initiative is doing a lot of advocacy around seeking state support to expand tiny House villages.,35,,
185,0.97,1160.159,1166.265,We have a goal of 12 House villages.,35,,
186,0.97,1166.265,1171.57,Obviously that comes with a lot of Upfront capital costs.,35,,
187,0.97,1171.57,1191.857,"We been able to get $2 million in capital expenses into the House budget, but now that the capital budgets need to be reconciled, and it isn't in the Senate budget, we are trying to make sure that we come out on the other side here with the $2 million in capital support for tiny houses.",35,,
188,0.97,1191.857,1214.613,"Obviously $2 million would support the Upfront capital costs for three tiny House villages and could support up to 120 people Exiting homelessness into tiny House--well, rather Exiting unsheltered Homelessess into tiny houses.",35,,
189,0.97,1214.613,1219.551,"I wanted to just ask, because I think we are at this point now where we are trying to reconcile the two capital budgets.",35,,
190,0.97,1219.551,1223.155,Where we are in making sure that $2 million stays in the final reconciled capital budget.,35,,
191,0.97,1223.155,1240.806,"Councilmember Lewis, it's my understanding that the way that the Senate budget is written is quite flexible and could be used for a range of housing options for everything from creating a tiny House village to actually acquiring buildings.",36,,
192,0.97,1240.806,1244.643,We are going to talk about that a little bit more at the end of this briefing.,36,,
193,0.97,1244.643,1258.257,"I do believe my read of the language is that, it certainly could be used for tiny House villages without an issue, although there is not a specific set aside.",36,,
194,0.97,1258.257,1260.259,In the Senate budget?,37,,
195,0.97,1260.259,1261.526,Yes.,38,,
196,0.97,1261.526,1272.938,"That's how I would read the Senate budget, but you could certainly apply to the Department of Commerce through the process and receive funding for such a project.",38,,
197,0.97,1272.938,1281.88,"Okay, so do you want me to do for my questions on this for when we talk about the capital budget later in the presentation then?",39,,
198,0.97,1281.88,1284.483,I do have some follow-ups on that.,39,,
199,0.97,1284.483,1287.753,You can certainly ask the question.,40,,
200,0.97,1287.753,1298.497,"I think we are just--I think we will talk a little bit more about advocating for some additional Federal dollars statewide, but feel free.",40,,
201,0.97,1298.497,1305.804,"I'm not sure I can answer all your questions right now, but I'm happy to get back to you if you would like to see them.",40,,
202,0.97,1305.804,1311.51,I can either answer now or do a closer read of the budget and get back to.,40,,
203,0.97,1311.51,1341.406,"I guess that my question is just I guess that this would just be--if it's a matter of structure, that the House has structured their budget in a different way where things are more clearly delineated and the Senate has just sort of created a more large, general, more flexible amount of funds that can be applied for.",41,,
204,0.97,1341.406,1364.329,"I guess what I'm wondering is just if that $2 million that is in the House budget for tiny houses is still--it sounds like what you're saying is it is still reflected in the Senate budget, it's just the money is applied for in a different way . is that a way to understand it?",41,,
205,0.97,1364.329,1368.166,"Yes, I would say that that is correct.",42,,
206,0.97,1368.166,1373.372,My read of the Senate budget is that it is a flexible amount of money that could be used for tiny House villages.,42,,
207,0.97,1373.372,1378.276,As part of a broader pot of money?,43,,
208,0.97,1378.276,1380.679,Correct.,44,,
209,0.97,1380.679,1381.78,Okay.,45,,
210,0.97,1381.78,1384.583,I think that's good enough for now.,45,,
211,0.97,1384.583,1385.45,Okay.,46,,
212,0.97,1385.45,1385.851,Thank you.,47,,
213,0.97,1385.851,1387.085,Thank you.,48,,
214,0.97,1387.085,1394.793,Is there any other questions?,49,,
215,0.97,1394.793,1395.594,Any other questions?,50,,
216,0.97,1395.594,1395.994,Exactly.,50,,
217,0.97,1395.994,1397.996,I'm not seeing any so I think we can keep going.,50,,
218,0.97,1397.996,1404.469,"Wonderful, then I will move on to police reform.",51,,
219,0.97,1404.469,1408.206,"As with housing, many proposals are moving along.",51,,
220,0.97,1408.206,1419.718,"House bill 1267, the governor's request legislation that would established statewide centralized investigation for use of force.",51,,
221,0.97,1419.718,1423.221,Executive action was taken on Friday.,51,,
222,0.97,1423.221,1433.031,"As was the use of force bill, House bill 1310, and those bills are both in the rules committee now.",51,,
223,0.97,1433.031,1442.34,"Senate bill 5051, the decertification bill, executive action was taken on that by the House Appropriations Committee last Thursday.",51,,
224,0.97,1442.34,1444.543,That is now in House rules.,51,,
225,0.97,1444.543,1456.955,"Senate bill 5066, the duty to intervene legislation was--also had executive action taken last Wednesday and is now in the House Rules Committee.",51,,
226,0.97,1456.955,1460.559,"So, that sort of the updates I have today on police reform.",51,,
227,0.97,1460.559,1464.93,If anyone has any questions I'm happy to answer those.,51,,
228,0.97,1464.93,1465.664,"Any questions, colleagues?",52,,
229,0.97,1465.664,1471.369,I'm not seeing any hands raised so I think we can keep going.,52,,
230,0.97,1471.369,1478.877,"Finally, in the area of public safety, executive action was taken on Friday on House bill 1320, that Streamlines all of the protective orders.",53,,
231,0.97,1478.877,1480.479,That bill is still moving along.,53,,
232,0.97,1480.479,1489.654,"Senate bill 5226, driving with a suspended license, passed out of the House transportation Committee on Friday.",53,,
233,0.97,1489.654,1499.998,"Finally, an update on where things are with the Blake decision, today in the ways in means Committee at 10, Senate bill 5476 has a hearing.",53,,
234,0.97,1499.998,1504.669,That is the bill that would establish personal use amount for controlled substances.,53,,
235,0.97,1504.669,1510.775,Remove the criminal penalty for possession of a controlled substance that doesn't exceed the personal amount.,53,,
236,0.97,1510.775,1518.283,It would also rise law enforcement to refer individuals to a frantic navigator.,53,,
237,0.97,1518.283,1534.532,The other thing that I found out is that it is not the intention of the bill to create a new misdemeanor that would be necessary for cities or municipal courts to manage for 18 to 21-Year-Olds.,53,,
238,0.97,1534.532,1536.535,The Senator apparently did not intend that.,53,,
239,0.97,1536.535,1553.618,"It looks like what will probably happen, although it is not in the bill quite yet, so we don't know for sure, but it looks like the approach will be to extend the jurisdiction of juvenile court for possession charges for 18 to 20-Year-Olds.",53,,
240,0.97,1553.618,1559.724,I think that is all that I have for public safety.,53,,
241,0.97,1559.724,1562.928,"If there are any questions, and if not I'll handed over to Hannah.",53,,

257,0.97,1657.288,1660.825,That is the highlights for safety net.,55,,

261,0.97,1667.165,1670.368,Looks like there are nine.,56,,
262,0.97,1670.368,1673.872,Finally in transportation.,57,,
263,0.97,1673.872,1680.779,I spoke already to the budget as well as the current status.,57,,
264,0.97,1680.779,1683.181,Two quick updates on legislation.,57,,
265,0.97,1683.181,1695.593,"First, House bill 1301, which is providing alternative enforcement methods, including Nonmonetary warnings instead of citations for sound transit.",57,,
266,0.97,1695.593,1698.463,That is in the Senate rules committee.,57,,
267,0.97,1698.463,1705.17,It has passed out of the transportation committee and is continuing to move forward.,57,,
268,0.97,1705.17,1708.807,"I know there was interest in Senate bill 5354, I do have an update there.",57,,

270,0.97,1721.219,1726.691,It was not voted out of committee prior to the fiscal cut off on Friday.,57,,
271,0.97,1726.691,1731.329,"So, that bill is unfortunately not moving forward this year.",57,,
272,0.97,1731.329,1734.132,It will continue to work on the issue over the interim.,57,,
273,0.97,1734.132,1742.941,"Any comments or questions on transportation, colleagues?",58,,
274,0.97,1742.941,1744.976,I'm not seeing any hands raised.,58,,
275,0.97,1744.976,1757.589,"Lily, do you want to make any closing remarks before I introduce the opportunity for Robin to chat with us?",59,,
276,0.97,1757.589,1765.063,I think we just would appreciate your support on the letter that Robin is going to speak to next.,60,,
277,0.97,1765.063,1765.864,Thank you so much.,60,,
278,0.97,1765.864,1766.731,Of course.,61,,
279,0.97,1766.731,1778.676,Any other questions or comments on the report before Robin talks to us about a really unique opportunity that is going to come potentially before us this afternoon?,61,,
280,0.97,1778.676,1780.945,I'm not seeing any other questions.,61,,
281,0.97,1780.945,1793.291,"Robin, why don't you go ahead and briefed the Council on the opportunity to signal support for some additional funding in the area of housing.",61,,
282,0.97,1793.291,1795.927,"Thank you, Council President Gonzalez.",62,,
283,0.97,1795.927,1811.209,Blair has been working on a letter to the governor and legislative leadership to address housing and homelessness with some of the Federal American rescue plan dollars that the state has received.,62,,
284,0.97,1811.209,1820.518,"Of course, they are getting $4 billion, and similarly to us, they are able to spend $2 billion this year and $2 billion next year.",62,,
285,0.97,1820.518,1835.5,We are asking for a historic investment in housing and homelessness of $400 million so we can bring people experiencing homelessness inside and secure more homes for vulnerable people in our communities.,62,,
286,0.97,1835.5,1839.637,This is a statewide asked.,62,,
287,0.97,1839.637,1849.948,We are asking many other cities to sign on so that we have a broad coalition asking for these resources.,62,,
288,0.97,1849.948,1861.759,Part of the reason why we started thinking that this would be a good idea in Seattle is that we are seeing a lot of unprecedented opportunities in the real estate market as a result of the pandemic.,62,,
289,0.97,1861.759,1872.136,"This also happened during the last recession and I think looking back, we probably didn't capitalize on that the way we we might have.",62,,
290,0.97,1872.136,1886.951,"With a one time investment in Federal resources, we know we can quickly purchase new, newly completed, under construction land, hotels or other buildings, to provide affordable housing and shelter.",62,,
291,0.97,1886.951,1897.295,The vision of this is that we know we have some opportunities similar to the clay that was purchased with office of housing resources.,62,,
292,0.97,1897.295,1902.433,It's an 80 unit building in Capitol Hill that is immediately being turned into housing for people that have experienced homelessness and veterans.,62,,
293,0.97,1902.433,1907.205,We know that there are other--there could be other opportunities out there like that.,62,,
294,0.97,1907.205,1919.817,"The idea is the communities could use the resources flexibly so that if you were in a different community and you needed shelter, you could do that.",62,,
295,0.97,1919.817,1922.854,We might choose to purchase buildings to create some throughput in our homelessness system.,62,,
296,0.97,1922.854,1925.323,The idea is for this money to meet community needs.,62,,
297,0.97,1925.323,1942.607,The idea is modeled off of California's home key where they invested $846 million in a six month period to quickly bring 6000 units of affordable housing and permanent shelters Online.,62,,
298,0.97,1942.607,1953.351,We believe that they are going to do additional investment in that program with their American rescue plan act dollars at the state level in California.,62,,
299,0.97,1953.351,1956.02,"So, I think that's pretty much the long and the short of it.",62,,
300,0.97,1956.02,1961.993,"I guess I just also kind of want to highlight too, that we are thinking of this as temporary acquisition.",62,,
301,0.97,1961.993,1968.166,We also really appreciate the longer-term investments through the housing trust fund.,62,,
302,0.97,1968.166,1970.868,That the state has invested.,62,,
303,0.97,1970.868,1976.874,"Also, tremendous operating budgets investments in both the house and Senate.",62,,
304,0.97,1976.874,1995.993,"Appreciating that, but really wanted to make sure that we capitalize on this moment in time where we have the ability to use Federal resources to bring people inside and we have a real estate market that would be--help us do this in a way that doesn't occur very often.",62,,
305,0.97,1995.993,1998.896,I'm happy to answer any questions.,62,,
306,0.97,1998.896,2009.874,"I will circulate the letter to your offices right after this meeting, as soon as I can get it out of my mailbox, and you can feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.",62,,
307,0.97,2009.874,2011.275,I'm happy to follow up.,62,,
308,0.97,2011.275,2017.382,"Also, I'm happy to answer questions now, but you may have some additional ones when you actually see the letter.",62,,
309,0.97,2017.382,2019.183,"Thanks for that, Robin.",63,,
310,0.97,2019.183,2022.42,I appreciate you bringing this forward.,63,,
311,0.97,2022.42,2027.525,I know that you highlighted this opportunity for me over the weekend.,63,,
312,0.97,2027.525,2029.527,We had an opportunity to talk about it this morning.,63,,
313,0.97,2029.527,2030.928,I think it's a unique opportunity.,63,,
314,0.97,2030.928,2042.54,"It is one that I hope we will pursue, but I know that folks might have some questions, both now, based on your oral briefing, but also after reviewing the contents of the letter.",63,,
315,0.97,2042.54,2053.518,It is my hope that we would be able to consider adding individual Councilmember signatures to the letter this afternoon during other business.,63,,
316,0.97,2053.518,2056.354,Of our full council meeting.,63,,
317,0.97,2056.354,2068.132,"So, I'm hoping we can get questions answered either now, or between now and 2:00 to effectuate that goal.",63,,
318,0.97,2068.132,2073.438,I do see that Councilmember Mosqueda has her hand up.,63,,
319,0.97,2073.438,2075.473,If anybody else has questions let me know.,63,,
320,0.97,2075.473,2079.677,Thank you very much.,64,,
321,0.97,2079.677,2085.983,Coming from the office of housing I know that this is a strategy that you have the office of housing have considered for a long time.,64,,
322,0.97,2085.983,2088.453,I just wanted to voice my support for this approach.,64,,
323,0.97,2088.453,2094.158,This is something I have been raising over the last year at the reasonable housing authority.,64,,
324,0.97,2094.158,2097.795,Talking with the sound cities or members as well.,64,,
325,0.97,2097.795,2109.574,"Part of the message that I think we need to send across the region, and thank you Robin for working across the state, and that this is a Win/Win opportunity.",64,,
326,0.97,2109.574,2117.715,"For those properties that are potentially going to elect or owners that do not have the resources or desire to move forward, we do not want there to be vacant properties, especially during the moment of a housing Affordability crisis.",64,,
327,0.97,2117.715,2119.117,And a homelessness crisis.,64,,
328,0.97,2119.117,2122.587,Especially in our region.,64,,
329,0.97,2122.587,2129.293,"This is truly something we haven't talked about, especially in light of the Covid induced recession.",64,,
330,0.97,2129.293,2141.038,This is part of the way that we can help build out of this recession by making sure that there is not there elect properties and we are turning into affordable housing and appropriate Non-Congregant shelter as directed by the CDC.,64,,
331,0.97,2141.038,2152.683,I think it also Dovetails nicely with the Jumpstart Seattle progressive revenue report that all of you help passed.,64,,
332,0.97,2152.683,2153.451,Over $240 million a year.,64,,
333,0.97,2153.451,2155.453,$135 million of that specifically for housing and homelessness.,64,,
334,0.97,2155.453,2158.756,Including and that was the strategic acquisition.,64,,
335,0.97,2158.756,2162.159,This relates to legislation we passed in 2018.,64,,
336,0.97,2162.159,2169.467,"Thanks to partnership with the office of housing, we continue to see that we have missed opportunities to Miss properties that were going up for sale.",64,,
337,0.97,2169.467,2184.282,"In a very hot housing market, which this still is, even though we are in the middle of a recession, we made it more possible for the house to go more quickly.",64,,
338,0.97,2184.282,2188.386,When it was clear those properties were analyzed from the previous legislation.,64,,
339,0.97,2188.386,2198.563,I bring that up because you are on the cusp of having our first property purchased because of that legislation we changed in 2018.,64,,
340,0.97,2198.563,2216.814,"While in housing we don't see overnight or the next day, the type of policy changes that immediately lead to housing, this policy here today that Robin is talking about and or support of this letter and approach could make it possible for us to fight literally the transformation overnight like we are seeing at clay apartments.",64,,
341,0.97,2216.814,2220.918,Very much supportive of this.,64,,
342,0.97,2220.918,2231.429,I think it is very much in line with our long-term commitments of the Council and of the city want to make sure there is more property acquired and that we stop selling our city property as well to the highest bidder.,64,,
343,0.97,2231.429,2235.533,This actually allows for the city to bring in more properties.,64,,
344,0.97,2235.533,2242.206,"Robin, love to work with you to see how we can make this Longer- term as well.",64,,
345,0.97,2242.206,2243.24,As this conversation progresses.,64,,
346,0.97,2243.24,2245.743,Really excited about this as you can tell and happy to sign up,64,,
347,0.97,2245.743,2248.512,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",65,,
348,0.97,2248.512,2260.257,I should also say this brought to mind I think director Alvarado let me know that I was Remiss if I didn't say the funding for the clay is from a revolving loan Fund.,66,,
349,0.97,2260.257,2274.472,"Those policies that Councilmember Mosqueda was talking about were created so the office of housing could be nimble and NAB these properties when they become available, however it is not a permanent source of financing.",66,,
350,0.97,2274.472,2277.375,It's meant to revolve so they could do it against once I found another property.,66,,
351,0.97,2277.375,2280.011,Take out financing as needed for the permanent financing of that building.,66,,
352,0.97,2280.011,2282.68,That is something we can use to research that should this become available.,66,,
353,0.97,2282.68,2302.3,"I should also say that your comments made me think too Councilmember Mosqueda, that this also gives me the opportunity to empower organizations to be able to purchase real estate or own real estate because they don't have to develop the capacity to actually develop the building.",66,,
354,0.97,2302.3,2308.873,They can certainly manage the resource to serve communities of color around the city.,66,,
355,0.97,2308.873,2312.877,I just wanted to add that in as well.,66,,
356,0.97,2312.877,2316.58,"Thanks for the additional piece of information, Robin.",67,,
357,0.97,2316.58,2319.617,"Colleagues, any other comments or questions on the letter?",67,,
358,0.97,2319.617,2323.487,I know that you all haven't seen the letter.,67,,
359,0.97,2323.487,2336.1,"That letter will be circulated as soon as we release Oir from today's Council briefing, so you will have an opportunity to read the full content and to ask Robin any additional questions.",67,,
360,0.97,2336.1,2341.005,It looks like folks don't have any more questions for Council briefing.,67,,
361,0.97,2341.005,2350.848,"I do think that this is an important opportunity for us to again, engage in this pretty Jik acquisition of underutilized properties.",67,,
362,0.97,2350.848,2367.364,Strategy through statewide approach I think it's important to acknowledge that there are several city leaders across the state that have already signaled support for moving in this direction.,67,,
363,0.97,2367.364,2376.073,"I think if Seattle can show up as a good regional partner in this effort, I am hopeful that we would all together, across the state.",67,,
364,0.97,2376.073,2389.487,"From the West side to the East side, be able to get this effort across the finish line to unlock some really significant new investments in this space.",67,,
365,0.97,2389.487,2394.358,I want to appreciate our team at Oir for doing this work.,67,,
366,0.97,2394.358,2396.427,"Thank you so much, Council President.",68,,
367,0.97,2396.427,2397.461,That concludes our briefing today.,68,,
368,0.97,2397.461,2405.269,Thank you so much for your help with the letter and we will get that out soon.,68,,
369,0.97,2405.269,2406.971,Absolutely.,69,,
370,0.97,2406.971,2412.009,Thank you so much.,69,,
371,0.97,2412.009,2416.113,We are going to let you go and we are going to continue on other items of business on our agenda.,69,,
372,0.97,2416.113,2421.585,"Next up is agenda item 4, which is the preview of today's city council actions, and meetings.",69,,
373,0.97,2421.585,2424.021,Today's order will be as follows.,69,,
374,0.97,2424.021,2440.037,"Councilmember Pedersen, followed by Sawant, Herbold, Juarez, Lewis, Morales, Mosqueda, and then I will include this by giving a report from Councilmember Strauss and also giving my own report.",69,,
375,0.97,2440.037,2445.342,"Without further Ado, Councilmember Pedersen.",69,,
376,0.97,2445.342,2446.343,You are up first.,69,,
377,0.97,2446.343,2450.648,Good morning colleagues.,70,,
378,0.97,2450.648,2454.652,Are transportation and utilities committee has no items on today's full city council agenda.,70,,
379,0.97,2454.652,2461.358,"However, are transportation and utilities committee has a meeting this Wednesday, April 7th at 9:30 A.M.",70,,
380,0.97,2461.358,2464.862,We published the agenda Online this past Friday and we have 12 items.,70,,
381,0.97,2464.862,2467.865,Please allow me to preview a few of the most substantive items.,70,,
382,0.97,2467.865,2479.677,"Regarding Seattle public utilities, at our April 17th, or April 7th Committee, we will hear from Seattle public utilities on their strategic business plan.",70,,
383,0.97,2479.677,2486.617,"This will lead into a discussion about rates for clean water, wastewater, along with trash, recycling and compost.",70,,
384,0.97,2486.617,2492.523,"Our city has become less affordable, and utility bills by their very nature are Regressive.",70,,
385,0.97,2492.523,2499.163,With lower income households paying a higher percentage of their household income for their bills.,70,,
386,0.97,2499.163,2500.798,"Therefore, our goal is to keep utility rates low.",70,,
387,0.97,2500.798,2515.212,"Thankfully during Covid, our city owned utilities both Spu and Seattle city light have managed to keep rates steady, increasing enrollment in our discount program, and waving late fees.",70,,
388,0.97,2515.212,2527.424,"With this new 22 Jik plan, it appears that Spu can keep or even improve upon, some of the promises on utility rates made with their strategic plan approved in 2017.",70,,
389,0.97,2527.424,2534.732,We should keep an eye on however on some cost drivers due to our governing structure with King County for wastewater treatment.,70,,
390,0.97,2534.732,2544.575,"We noted a majority of King County Council, unfortunately raised their wastewater treatment the, which is passed directly through to our Seattle Ratepayers.",70,,
391,0.97,2544.575,2551.949,We want to make sure King County makes growth pay for growth going forward.,70,,
392,0.97,2551.949,2554.652,Especially for real estate development in suburban or rural areas of the county.,70,,
393,0.97,2554.652,2559.423,"Here at City hall, we also have to be mindful of the so-called utility tax.",70,,
394,0.97,2559.423,2565.362,That our city government's general fund takes from Ratepayers.,70,,
395,0.97,2565.362,2573.938,Last year the general fund relied on about $200 million from the utilities through a utility tax that we charge.,70,,
396,0.97,2573.938,2588.552,Charging this utility taxes a budgeting technique that Councilmember Herbold helped to daylight when she chaired the Spu committee and increased transparency of this by calling it out on customer utility bills.,70,,
397,0.97,2588.552,2598.095,"To take next steps, we should consider reducing the Regressed utility taxes that we charge and enable Spu to use the savings to take care of its aging infrastructure.",70,,
398,0.97,2598.095,2615.98,"In sum, despite the Covid pandemic, despite the high pastor away from King County for wastewater treatment, and despite the utility tax that we charge, Spu is laser focused on Affordability and equity by keeping its own cost down as a shining example to all city examples.",70,,
399,0.97,2615.98,2631.428,"It directly benefits over 1 million Ratepayers who, thanks to the strategic plan and revised rate, will not need to suffer an average increase above what had already been planned to be charged as promised in the 2017 strategic plan.",70,,
400,0.97,2631.428,2638.736,It's important to highlight that the customer review panel for Spu has endorsed this new strategic plan and its corresponding rate path.,70,,
401,0.97,2638.736,2651.515,I want to thank the dedicated volunteers of our customer review panel for their Council hours of service to Seattle as a watchdog and a sounding board for this one billion-dollar city owned utility enterprise.,70,,
402,0.97,2651.515,2659.623,We will be hearing this legislation on the strategic plan and rate path in at least two meetings of the transportation and utilities committee before we approve it.,70,,
403,0.97,2659.623,2661.659,Another item on committee.,70,,
404,0.97,2661.659,2664.928,Technology matching fund awards.,70,,
405,0.97,2664.928,2672.87,The Covid crisis has laid bare the disparities in our communities and Magnify the need to bridge the Digital divide.,70,,
406,0.97,2672.87,2676.673,As called for by our city's bold Internet for all action plan.,70,,
407,0.97,2676.673,2693.357,"Even as we expand access to the Internet throughout Seattle, our technology matching fund continues as a cornerstone of our efforts to connect all our city's residents to education, jobs, and other biter services.",70,,
408,0.97,2693.357,2701.498,"Earlier last week, the city of Seattle announce the recipients of the 2021 technology matching Fund and we will have a presentation on the awards at our committee this week.",70,,
409,0.97,2701.498,2717.514,"And modest investment of $343,000, 15 local organizations can Implemet community led projects to increase access to technology and provide Digital skills training to over 2000 people among Underserved communities.",70,,
410,0.97,2717.514,2731.528,"As we consider how to invest funds from the Federal Government, from such new sources of the American rescue plan act, we can be mindful of the Digital divide in the midst of our high-tech city.",70,,
411,0.97,2731.528,2734.598,Seattle maybe a high-tech city but we must also be an inclusive Tech city too.,70,,
412,0.97,2734.598,2740.904,That's why we unanimously improved the Internet for all action plan last year.,70,,
413,0.97,2740.904,2746.543,There were many organizations that did not receive grants due to limited funding.,70,,
414,0.97,2746.543,2755.319,The new Federal dollars could be a way to quickly get additional investments out the door to address the Digital divide.,70,,
415,0.97,2755.319,2760.357,"At the following committee meeting on April 21st, our information technology Department will return to provide an update on the Internet for all action plan.",70,,
416,0.97,2760.357,2761.425,That we adopted last year.,70,,
417,0.97,2761.425,2763.026,Surveillance impact reports.,70,,
418,0.97,2763.026,2775.839,Our committee will also continue work on the so-called group 2 surveillance impact reports that assess Technologies already in use by city government departments.,70,,
419,0.97,2775.839,2800.397,"Pursuant to the Foundational surveillance ordinance, adopted in 2017 and refined in 2018, our existing technology and computer programs undergo an extensive review project by the executive departments of community led surveillance working groups and other civic holders while technology is vital to enable local government to provide services more efficiently to the public, some technology can also have surveillance capabilities and privacy concerns that need to be evaluated with surveillance impact reports.",70,,
420,0.97,2800.397,2818.682,"As we promised, we took the single Council bill containing the five existing police Department Technologies introduced February 22nd, and broke it into five separate bills so that we can be more nimble as we work to amend and vote on each bill out of committee this week.",70,,
421,0.97,2818.682,2822.319,"We heard these bills on our March 3RD, March 17th committee meetings.",70,,
422,0.97,2822.319,2829.626,"This is the third time to discuss them and finally vote them out this Wednesday, April 7th.",70,,
423,0.97,2829.626,2835.332,"Thank you, committee members for finalizing your amendments last week so our city attorney's office could complete a thorough review of them.",70,,
424,0.97,2835.332,2837.401,These amendments are already published on our committee agenda.,70,,

426,0.97,2846.71,2854.651,"We also have to look forward to groups three, groups for a and 4B technology to consider later this year.",70,,
427,0.97,2854.651,2863.16,"Finally, the first item on our committee agenda is a project in Lake city which I'll leave Councilmember Juarez to speak about.",70,,
428,0.97,2863.16,2866.43,She will also be attending our committee this week for at least that item.,70,,
429,0.97,2866.43,2872.336,"And district 4, I really want to thank sound transit for their collaboration on two projects.",70,,

435,0.97,2913.71,2921.018,That is the new village I've been working on at the corner of Northeast 45Th Street and Roosevelt way.,70,,
436,0.97,2921.018,2932.829,"The nonprofit low income housing Institute continue to conduct community outreach about that tiny home village, which so far has been well received due to the growing need to get people camping in our parks inside, safe and connected to services to improve their lives.",70,,

445,0.97,2960.657,2961.258,Good morning.,71,,
446,0.97,2961.258,2964.328,Good morning.,72,,
447,0.97,2964.328,2970.233,There are no items on today's city council agenda from the distant ability and Renters rights committee.,72,,
448,0.97,2970.233,2976.473,"The next meeting of the committee is scheduled for a special time Thursday, April 15th at 9:30 A.M.",72,,
449,0.97,2976.473,2993.59,"At that meeting we will hear from community organizers about the green new deal and their efforts towards making sure that Seattle gets on track to its goals on carbon emissions, which it is absolutely not on track of right now.",72,,
450,0.97,2993.59,2996.994,Which is what we went over at our last committee.,72,,
451,0.97,2996.994,3003.9,We need to rapidly Electrify our city infrastructure and ultimately break the power of fossil fuel companies on our society.,72,,
452,0.97,3003.9,3010.207,Our last committee meeting ran over time so we postponed this agenda item.,72,,
453,0.97,3010.207,3016.313,"Thursday's meeting will be an opportunity to catch up on that important discussion . Thursday, April 15th.",72,,
454,0.97,3016.313,3026.089,Last week my office sent to the city attorney's office for final review two Renters rights bills.,72,,
455,0.97,3026.089,3029.159,Once they are reviewed we will be sending them to the Council president for introduction.,72,,
456,0.97,3029.159,3038.835,The first bill closes the loopholes in Seattle's just cause Eviction protections using the same initiatives as a Federal way budget bill from 2019.,72,,
457,0.97,3038.835,3044.741,It allows landlords to renew the lease is on fixed term leases.,72,,
458,0.97,3044.741,3049.045,Unless they have good cause for refusing.,72,,
459,0.97,3049.045,3052.849,I know Councilmember Morales is also interested in closing that loophole.,72,,
460,0.97,3052.849,3061.425,The other bill would create a moratorium on the Eviction of schoolchildren and their families and educators each year during the school year.,72,,
461,0.97,3061.425,3074.638,"It is common sense, but there's also mountains of research showing that when children are evicted it has devastating effect on their academic achievement, their learning and developing, and also on their mental health.",72,,
462,0.97,3074.638,3076.873,Imagine trying to focus on your schoolwork while losing your home.,72,,
463,0.97,3076.873,3104.067,"The losing home report, which we have cited many times, besides this research also found that of the respondents with School-Aged children, 85.7% said their children had to move schools after the Eviction, and 87.5% reported their children's school performance struggled very much because of the Eviction.",72,,
464,0.97,3104.067,3114.411,"Our bill would prohibit the Eviction of children, students up through 12th grade, their families and educators during the school year.",72,,
465,0.97,3114.411,3125.622,"I continue to think that the fact that children are evicted in one of the richest cities in the richest country in the world is a damning condemnation of global capitalism, but at the very least the city has the power to stop emissions during the school year.",72,,
466,0.97,3125.622,3140.237,"Our bill is modeled after our winter Evictions Bandpass a little over a year ago from--was introduced on my office, and the Renters right movement, including recommendation by the city of Seattle Renters Commission.",72,,
467,0.97,3140.237,3146.143,It's also modeled after a similar but a little more limited Renter protection in San Francisco.,72,,
468,0.97,3146.143,3160.757,We sent the draft bill to get input from parents of public school students in Seattle and also to the Seattle division Association and members of the Seattle--the leadership and the rank and file.,72,,
469,0.97,3160.757,3163.96,So that we can get more input from them.,72,,
470,0.97,3163.96,3166.263,"Finally, I want to address the 72 hour parking ban.",72,,
471,0.97,3166.263,3171.067,The moratorium that has been for the pandemic period.,72,,
472,0.97,3171.067,3184.147,I was extremely troubled to hear that Mayor Durkan's plans to reintroduce the 72 hour parking row which is Ticketing or Towing cars parked for 72 hours.,72,,
473,0.97,3184.147,3191.588,Essentially Criminalizing people for being poor and asking anyone without a driveway or garage.,72,,

477,0.97,3211.508,3217.047,The enforcement of this is very much dependent on whether it is a generally well off neighborhood or it's a more working class or poor neighborhood.,72,,

485,0.97,3274.271,3286.082,They are currently terrified about what the reintroduction of the 72 hour parking ban will have on their lives.,72,,
486,0.97,3286.082,3291.154,I join these community leaders and urging Mayor Durkan to immediately extend the emergency moratorium on the 72 hour parking row.,72,,
487,0.97,3291.154,3293.59,That is the most urgently needed.,72,,
488,0.97,3293.59,3304.768,"I also believe that the 72 hour parking ban, pandemic or not, does more harm than good.",72,,
489,0.97,3304.768,3311.875,"Even in good times, the 72 hour parking ban exclusively punishes the poor and Working- class people who don't have access to driveways and garages.",72,,

493,0.97,3354.517,3371.534,"Really crucial stories from community members as to why they support this, not only from our homeless community members, but from others who don't rely on this moratorium, and yet they understand that socially it is important that we don't have such punitive rules that end up actually being punitive towards poor people as a whole.",72,,

500,0.97,3401.464,3423.987,I do want to just put within sort of a Timeline context the fact that the police Department had significantly limited its Towing and enforcement of the 72 hour law as it relates to this Pre-Covid-19.,74,,
501,0.97,3423.987,3429.692,That's why we worked to develop the Rv mitigation program.,74,,
502,0.97,3429.692,3451.848,"Rather than focusing on an enforcement approach to the folks--the fact that people are living in Rvs, they worked with Seattle public utilities, the police Department in Seattle public utilities, to develop the Rv mediation program.",74,,
503,0.97,3451.848,3468.465,"This is sort of within the context of there being a pause, again, long before Covid, in doing the Towing of these vehicles.",74,,
504,0.97,3468.465,3472.969,I don't think it was just a policy that was formed merely by the need.,74,,
505,0.97,3472.969,3475.972,The humanitarian need.,74,,
506,0.97,3475.972,3489.786,It's also I think in recognition that we do have a pending case in the courts around the legality of impounding the vehicles that people live in.,74,,

770,0.97,5270.632,5282.377,"The first amendment relates to making an amendment to the existing legislation as it was transmitted to instead of giving $1.5 million to city light and public utilities, I want to retain those dollars for rental assistance.",87,,
