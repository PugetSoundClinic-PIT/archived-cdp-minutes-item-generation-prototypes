20,0.97,85.585,93.46,"The city of Seattle's fortunate to operate two major utility enterprises, Seattle public utilities and Seattle city light.",6,,
21,0.97,93.46,109.542,"And this also keeps the city council busy with a large volume of legislation, which is why we're here today as we get ready for our fall budget season to handle some of this business that Seattle city light's been working on and presenting to us today.",6,,
22,0.97,109.542,117.917,"The first three items, there are five items on the agenda, the first three relate to the Electrication of the transportation infrastructure.",6,,

24,0.97,123.456,129.395,"So at this time, I'd like to open up the remote public comment period.",6,,
25,0.97,129.395,136.669,I'll ask that everyone please be patient as we learn to operate this new system in Realtime and navigate through inevitable growing pains.,6,,
26,0.97,136.669,145.578,We're always looking for ways to fine tune this process and add new features to allow different ways for public participation in our Council meetings.,6,,
27,0.97,145.578,151.151,It remains the strong intent of the city Council to have public comment regularly included on meeting Agendas.,6,,
28,0.97,151.151,168.568,"However, the city council reserves the right to modify these public comment periods at any point if we deem that the system is being abused or it's unsuitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and in a manner in which we're able to conduct our necessary business.",6,,
29,0.97,168.568,172.105,I'll moderate the public comment period in the following manner.,6,,

46,0.97,269.235,271.804,"Good morning, Alice.",7,,
47,0.97,271.804,284.584,"This is at Lits Lockhart with 350 Seattle, and we were asked by a community member to comment on the city light transportation electric plan.",7,,
48,0.97,284.584,297.063,"The plan has great aspirations, but like most governmental climate change it has no Scomard fast Timeline and no commitment to total Electrification by a specific date.",7,,
49,0.97,297.063,298.264,"That's, of course, a problem.",7,,
50,0.97,298.264,311.411,"We are all a little busy right now, Council, and 350 Seattle, trying to Defund SPD and save transit and housing and human services, but city light core competency should be achieving Electrification.",7,,
51,0.97,311.411,339.772,"It would be really great if before the Council vote on this plan Council could ask for it to be amended such that at least the next step section includes a strong commitment with a Timeline to develop an actionable, measurable, Time-Based plan for reaching 100% Electrification by a date commensurate with the climate crisis, say 2030.",7,,
52,0.97,339.772,346.813,"The climate crisis has a Timeline, and our government plan to deal with it really should also have Timelines.",7,,
53,0.97,346.813,359.826,And this might be if the Council opted to ask for that the first time I've seen such a government plan with a Timeline and Metrics in our region.,7,,
54,0.97,359.826,360.56,It would be great.,7,,
55,0.97,360.56,366.999,It's a--and you're the ones to do it.,7,,
56,0.97,366.999,368.501,Thank you so much.,7,,
57,0.97,368.501,369.469,Thank you.,8,,

59,0.97,373.039,373.74,Go ahead Leah.,8,,
60,0.97,373.74,375.208,"Hi, good morning.",9,,
61,0.97,375.208,381.18,"My name is Leah, and I'm the Washington transportation policy manager at climate solutions.",9,,
62,0.97,381.18,391.858,We're in strong support of Seattle city light's strategic investment plan and the ordinance that would grant city light the authority to offer incentive programs.,9,,
63,0.97,391.858,399.031,The transportation sector is responsible for the largest share of Seattle's greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.,9,,
64,0.97,399.031,406.205,"As the Washington environmental health disparities map clearly shows, this is not equal.",9,,
65,0.97,406.205,413.679,"It is urgent that we power our transit, freight and other vehicles with city light's 100% clean electricity.",9,,
66,0.97,413.679,422.822,"Without utility support, we will not be able to rapidly Electrify at the rate that's necessary to meet Seattle's climate goals.",9,,
67,0.97,422.822,437.804,"City light authority to start this work so it can legally move forward with developing a more detailed implementation plan, including program development based on extensive community outreach, particularly with environmental justice communities.",9,,
68,0.97,437.804,439.172,Any and all vehicles on the road need to be clean.,9,,
69,0.97,439.172,441.307,This is a step in that direction.,9,,
70,0.97,441.307,450.683,"It is also a benefit to all city light's customers and will put downward pressure on rates, not to mention the positive impact on the air pollution.",9,,
71,0.97,450.683,452.318,We cannot delay climate action any longer.,9,,
72,0.97,452.318,457.924,"The more time we take to cut emissions, the harder it will be to do what must be done.",9,,
73,0.97,457.924,462.762,Thank you for allowing us to comment today and I urge your support.,9,,
74,0.97,462.762,463.029,Thank you.,9,,
75,0.97,463.029,464.463,"Thank you, Leah.",10,,
76,0.97,464.463,472.605,The next Speaker is Thomas Ashley followed by Michael Ruby.,10,,
77,0.97,472.605,473.473,"Go ahead, Thomas.",10,,
78,0.97,473.473,474.807,Good morning.,11,,
79,0.97,474.807,486.619,Thomas Ashley speaking in strong support of city light's strategic investment plan to support Transportational Electrication.,11,,
80,0.97,486.619,495.194,"I'm vice president of policy and market development for glean lots, a leading electric vehicle charging software and services company.",11,,
81,0.97,495.194,518.951,"And I just want to communicate green lot lots' very strong support for the strategic investment plan, which, frankly, is one of the most robust and well balanced and thought out plans that we have seen in this space.",11,,
82,0.97,518.951,552.151,"We urge your chair Pedersen and the Councilmembers support for the plan and also want to highlight that there really is no better time thus far for Seattle to affirm its commitment to the community and residents and, indeed, the world of its support for a healthier community and a zero emissions future, so thank you.",11,,
83,0.97,552.151,554.186,"Thank you, Thomas.",12,,
84,0.97,554.186,558.491,Our next Speaker is Michael Ruby followed by Rachel.,12,,
85,0.97,558.491,558.691,Hi.,13,,
86,0.97,558.691,563.362,"I am Mike Ruby, I live in Wallingford.",13,,
87,0.97,563.362,566.732,"Gertrude Stein Famously said of Oakland, there is no there there.",13,,
88,0.97,566.732,573.673,That summarizes what I have to say about the city light transportation Electrification strategic investment plan.,13,,
89,0.97,573.673,574.84,There is no plan there.,13,,
90,0.97,574.84,584.35,This plan does nothing to convince the Reeder that city light appreciates the scope of what is required to move forward the Electrification of Seattle's vehicle fleet.,13,,
91,0.97,584.35,599.332,I urge you to send this plan back to city light for further development and more information that will demonstrate that city light understands what it needs to do in providing the infrastructure and power capacity that will be needed to achieve Seattle's climate goals.,13,,
92,0.97,599.332,606.439,The plan is summarized in two places--tables on page 13 and 14 and page 20.,13,,
93,0.97,606.439,611.811,"These are all reasonable, high level priorities, and they offered examples that are useful.",13,,
94,0.97,611.811,612.845,That is not enough.,13,,
95,0.97,612.845,623.289,There is nothing there or anywhere else in the plan that documents that it is convincing that city light understands the magnitude of the task before us and preparing to meet it.,13,,
96,0.97,623.289,629.629,"The priorities and examples are sufficiently vague, really nothing more than a catalog of good ideas.",13,,
97,0.97,629.629,636.302,City light could do very little and still be able to say they met the plan's intent.,13,,
98,0.97,636.302,645.778,The study from rocky mountain Institute in your docket evaluates three scenarios for future penetration of electric vehicles in the Seattle mobile market.,13,,
99,0.97,645.778,653.052,Only the aggressive scenario will take us to the goal of 30% of the automobile fleet electric by 2030.,13,,
100,0.97,653.052,663.462,The proposed plan does not give any indication that city light is building the capability or capacity to support the aggressive scenario laid out in the rocky mountain Institute study.,13,,
101,0.97,663.462,668.567,"In addition to the resolution adopting the plan, city light has sent you two ordinances supporting the plan.",13,,
102,0.97,668.567,674.24,These ordinances are needed and should be forwarded to the Council to pass.,13,,
103,0.97,674.24,681.08,The plan itself needs more work and the city council needs to be clear to city light that it expects more.,13,,
104,0.97,681.08,691.29,It is certainly reasonable to ask them to come back to you in December with a more useful and convincing document.,13,,
105,0.97,691.29,693.526,"Thank you, Mr. Ruby.",14,,
106,0.97,693.526,703.035,Next Speaker is Rachel followed by Rachel.,14,,
107,0.97,703.035,704.703,Go ahead.,14,,
108,0.97,704.703,704.904,Hi.,15,,
109,0.97,704.904,705.404,My name is Rachel.,15,,
110,0.97,705.404,717.049,"While I think most of this plan is fine, we're preparing for our in progress Electrification and for electrified freight, and that's great.",15,,
111,0.97,717.049,721.62,The largest single source of emissions are from passenger vehicles.,15,,
112,0.97,721.62,732.398,Even in the rocky Mount study only gets us to 30% of passenger vehicles converted by 2030.,15,,
113,0.97,732.398,736.836,That's still a lot of carbon emissions in 2030.,15,,
114,0.97,736.836,744.31,The presentation includes a slogan of just say no but very low in this plan would discourage that happening.,15,,
115,0.97,744.31,750.182,"Bikes and personal ability are mentioned, but none of the suggested offerings apply unless you drive a car.",15,,
116,0.97,750.182,753.452,They do not encourage giving up cars.,15,,
117,0.97,753.452,757.423,The incentives are not in line with environmental goals.,15,,
118,0.97,757.423,761.794,"Every Ev charged helps a sales budget, but electric cars have costs.",15,,
119,0.97,761.794,767.566,"Air and water pollution due to tire and brake dust, congestion and injury and death.",15,,
120,0.97,767.566,776.275,"The electricity comes from our hydroelectric system, which is great, but it still Harms waterways and our Habitats for salmon and other life.",15,,
121,0.97,776.275,781.614,We should be electrifying our vehicles but also try to reduce electrical use.,15,,
122,0.97,781.614,784.717,Reduction of harm and transportation demands mode shift.,15,,
123,0.97,784.717,792.291,"The plan should reflect what's more efficient for utility, but this plan is not that.",15,,
124,0.97,792.291,800.466,"We should certainly have electric charging stations, but our plan for Electrification for personal transportation should support more than electric cars.",15,,
125,0.97,800.466,808.841,"Thank you so much, city Council, for looking at this.",15,,
126,0.97,808.841,811.243,"Our next Speaker is also Rachel, followed by Morris.",16,,
127,0.97,811.243,819.852,"Hello, my name is Rachel, and I'm the acting director of climate and energy initiatives in the office of King County executive Dow Constantine.",17,,
128,0.97,819.852,825.691,I'm speaking in support of city light's transportation Electrification strategic investment plan.,17,,
129,0.97,825.691,830.696,The transportation sector produces the highest amount of carbon emissions in King County.,17,,
130,0.97,830.696,838.07,It is time to address the sector to reduce tail pipe emissions and benefit from clean sources of electricity.,17,,
131,0.97,838.07,843.242,We transmitted King County's 2020 strategic climate action plan to the King County Council.,17,,
132,0.97,843.242,851.383,"Vehicle Electrification is a key strategy to reaching our shared, Countywide emission reduction targets of 50% by 2030.",17,,
133,0.97,851.383,853.285,The plan support this is goal.,17,,
134,0.97,853.285,866.398,The Electrification of our transit fleet is a key component Poff our plan and city light has partnered with King County Metro for the first 40 long range battery electric buses will charge.,17,,
135,0.97,866.398,876.108,"City light has provided valuable input and guidance on design, guidelines, technical solutions for rate and load management that promote low cost, low impact solution.",17,,
136,0.97,876.108,880.312,Climate justice is a priority for King County as it is for Seattle.,17,,
137,0.97,880.312,891.624,We support the plan's focus on addressing environmental inequities endured by near road communities and seek to work in partnership with city light and communities on equitable solutions.,17,,
138,0.97,891.624,894.693,King County supports the plan and we look forward to collaborating.,17,,
139,0.97,894.693,899.565,I thank you for the opportunity to testify today.,17,,
140,0.97,899.565,901.267,"Thank you, Rachel.",18,,
141,0.97,901.267,907.339,Next up is Morris followed by Phillip Jones.,18,,
142,0.97,907.339,907.806,Go ahead.,18,,
143,0.97,907.806,909.508,"Hi, my name is Morris.",19,,
144,0.97,909.508,920.853,I live in Wallingford and I'm a climate activist and work with many different groups.,19,,
145,0.97,920.853,923.722,The plan says the right things at a high level.,19,,
146,0.97,923.722,926.358,It's not clear how things will be achieved.,19,,
147,0.97,926.358,935.668,Where is accountability for being in sync with the city greenhouse gas reduction plan?,19,,
148,0.97,935.668,945.978,"Accountability issues, I have no confidence because in 2017 20 fast Chargers were supposed to be installed by 2020.",19,,
149,0.97,945.978,947.346,I don't think this happened.,19,,
150,0.97,947.346,954.42,"So how are we going to achieve all of these big goals, vague goals in the plan?",19,,
151,0.97,954.42,961.66,Are these goals even sufficient for the city meet 80% emission reduction by 2030?,19,,
152,0.97,961.66,969.068,How does this fit with the Seattle city light plan?,19,,
153,0.97,969.068,977.943,These goals seem well below what is needed and it's not clear that this plan will even achieve that 30% Electrification of light duty vehicles.,19,,
154,0.97,977.943,982.748,People will want to drive electric cars when they are confident they can get a charge.,19,,
155,0.97,982.748,986.151,There are many barriers to Multidwelling charging.,19,,
156,0.97,986.151,992.391,Charging in Multidwelling units is mentioned but no specific goal such as number of buildings with Ev on site are not.,19,,
157,0.97,992.391,996.662,These are just a few of the issues with the vagueness of the plan.,19,,
158,0.97,996.662,1002.634,"The faster we Electrify, the more people will be spared a chronic disease and death.",19,,
159,0.97,1002.634,1014.046,"The planning must include more ambitious goal, more Trackable charges so the public know we are seriously aiming to achieve our Ghg goals.",19,,
160,0.97,1014.046,1016.982,70% of all Ghg comes from cities.,19,,
161,0.97,1016.982,1017.85,City policies matter.,19,,
162,0.97,1017.85,1027.426,The public wants to have accountability to our Ghg goals.,19,,
163,0.97,1027.426,1028.127,Thank you.,19,,
164,0.97,1028.127,1028.66,Thank you.,20,,
165,0.97,1028.66,1031.964,Next up Phillip Jones followed by Robert ditch.,20,,
166,0.97,1031.964,1033.132,"Go ahead, Phillip.",20,,
167,0.97,1033.132,1036.602,"Thank you chair Pedersen, members Tor committee.",21,,
168,0.97,1036.602,1038.771,I'm a resident of still North Capitol Hill.,21,,
169,0.97,1038.771,1050.916,I served as a utilities Commissioner in Olympia for 12 years under governor Gregoire and the current governor.,21,,
170,0.97,1050.916,1053.152,Worked heavily on issues like transportation Electrification storage.,21,,
171,0.97,1053.152,1066.165,"I'd like to say to some of the folks on the phone, it took three tries to get 1512 passed and I was a Commissioner for part of that and we wasted some time by getting the public funds.",21,,
172,0.97,1066.165,1074.907,"So I understand that some people want to go faster, but we've already spent a few years trying to get the legislation passed.",21,,
173,0.97,1074.907,1080.179,"This is a, as Tom and Rachel said, this is a state of the art plan.",21,,
174,0.97,1080.179,1083.148,It's not focused on strategy as much as implementation.,21,,
175,0.97,1083.148,1089.121,It is very difficult to build public charging stations and get steel in the ground and get this--get things going.,21,,
176,0.97,1089.121,1092.925,So I think we should try to work with the plan.,21,,
177,0.97,1092.925,1096.261,It has a strong emphasis on equity.,21,,
178,0.97,1096.261,1108.907,"I work in 25 States around the country and this is probably one of the best plans, especially on the equitable access issues for both transit, heavy duty and then light duty vehicles.",21,,
179,0.97,1108.907,1119.051,"It's also very good on the Stakeholder process, and they set up an excellent Stakeholder process with the Bipoc community's support, King County Metro and others.",21,,
180,0.97,1119.051,1123.789,So I think you should be proud of this plan.,21,,
181,0.97,1123.789,1124.289,It's ripe.,21,,
182,0.97,1124.289,1125.691,It's ready to be implemented.,21,,
183,0.97,1125.691,1143.075,"One last thing, the hybrid model of own and operate as well as working with--where city light owns and operates infrastructure as well as third parties is well Crafted and multifamily units especially need the emphasis of Seattle city light to build out.",21,,
184,0.97,1143.075,1145.544,And actually own and operate the infrastructure.,21,,
185,0.97,1145.544,1146.879,Thank you.,21,,
186,0.97,1146.879,1148.28,"Thank you, Phillip Jones.",22,,
187,0.97,1148.28,1153.485,Next we have Robert followed by Iris.,22,,
188,0.97,1153.485,1153.886,"Go ahead, Robert.",22,,
189,0.97,1153.886,1158.957,"Hello, thank you, Councilmembers for the time today.",23,,
190,0.97,1158.957,1166.732,I'm here to strongly support the Electrification plan and ordinance put forth by Seattle city light today to go to full Council on the 6th.,23,,
191,0.97,1166.732,1170.169,And it's far past the time for a plan like this.,23,,
192,0.97,1170.169,1173.705,My support does come with a caveat.,23,,
193,0.97,1173.705,1180.379,The plan indicates we shouldn't do one for one Ev replacement.,23,,
194,0.97,1180.379,1183.649,And I love that and I thank you guys for noting that.,23,,
195,0.97,1183.649,1186.084,The problem for me is two fold.,23,,
196,0.97,1186.084,1188.453,The action steps here don't reflect those priorities.,23,,
197,0.97,1188.453,1195.26,And from what I can tell won't reflect those priorities until much later in this process if at all.,23,,
198,0.97,1195.26,1207.239,I would love to see further updates to the plan to factor in how Seattle can help improve other light electric vehicles like Scooters and bikes to be better used in Chargers in our city.,23,,
199,0.97,1207.239,1220.252,"The other issue that we have here is with Council, quite frankly, and it is the process in order to get the system in place that we need to Decarbon our city.",23,,
200,0.97,1220.252,1224.356,It should not take a three-year process to design a bike Lane.,23,,
201,0.97,1224.356,1228.66,It should not take 20 years to fix the Burke Gilman trail.,23,,
202,0.97,1228.66,1233.065,It shouldn't take three years to build out our sidewalk work.,23,,
203,0.97,1233.065,1234.533,We cannot beat carbon without these things.,23,,
204,0.97,1234.533,1238.27,It's well past time to do these things.,23,,
205,0.97,1238.27,1253.852,I encourage Spl to meet those goals it States it has and find ways to get over the bureaucratic hurdle between different departments and be a booster of these items and products and services that can get us around town.,23,,
206,0.97,1253.852,1264.329,Scl could be the biggest booster there are a million reasons under the sun of why it would be difficult.,23,,
207,0.97,1264.329,1273.672,I encourage you to fight past that because we do not have the time to be stuck on these things.,23,,
208,0.97,1273.672,1278.644,"And unlike the last Commenter's note that we need to be patient here, we don't have the time for that.",23,,
209,0.97,1278.644,1283.081,I thank you for your time and hope you have a wonderful weekend.,23,,
210,0.97,1283.081,1285.284,"Thank you, Robert.",24,,
211,0.97,1285.284,1286.918,Iris followed by Annabelle.,24,,
212,0.97,1286.918,1287.819,"Go ahead, Iris.",24,,
213,0.97,1287.819,1288.587,"Thank you, Hi.",25,,
214,0.97,1288.587,1289.488,My name is Iris.,25,,
215,0.97,1289.488,1292.157,Thank you for taking my comments this morning.,25,,
216,0.97,1292.157,1296.928,"We're in a climate crisis, and we all need to take bold steps to address this.",25,,
217,0.97,1296.928,1301.099,Scl is in a position to do so.,25,,
218,0.97,1301.099,1309.274,The ordinance as you proposed will Incentivize switching to electric vehicles for customers are potentially helpful and should be passed.,25,,
219,0.97,1309.274,1319.551,"However, the plan you have put forth falls far short of what is needed now to meet our 2030 goal of having 30% of vehicles in Seattle Electric.",25,,
220,0.97,1319.551,1324.456,"As proposed, it may not even meet a 10% goal.",25,,
221,0.97,1324.456,1325.991,This is not Fearly sufficient.,25,,
222,0.97,1325.991,1341.173,I encourage this committee to reject this resolution and ask Scl planners to Rework the plan and return to the Council in December with recommendations in line with the goal of 30% of automobiles in Seattle be electric vehicles by 2030.,25,,
223,0.97,1341.173,1346.211,"In addition, we need a much more aggressive public easy charger program.",25,,
224,0.97,1346.211,1348.213,We have clean electricity in Seattle.,25,,
225,0.97,1348.213,1353.518,We must maximize its potential to have a meaningful effect on mitigating climate change.,25,,
226,0.97,1353.518,1355.787,If there's any place in the U.S.,25,,
227,0.97,1355.787,1359.257,"That can be a success at Electrification, it is Seattle.",25,,
228,0.97,1359.257,1360.892,Thank you very much.,25,,
229,0.97,1360.892,1362.194,"Thank you, Iris.",26,,
230,0.97,1362.194,1369.034,"And committee members, we have just three Mr. speakers.",26,,
231,0.97,1369.034,1372.137,Annabelle followed by Kimberly kitchen.,26,,
232,0.97,1372.137,1372.604,"Annabelle, go ahead.",26,,
233,0.97,1372.604,1388.353,"Good morning, my name is Annabelle, I'm a policy associate with the Northwest energy coalition, an alliance of over 100 organizations.",27,,
234,0.97,1388.353,1395.193,I've worked with each Northwest utility at various levels on the design of their plans and programs.,27,,
235,0.97,1395.193,1409.708,I'm near support of the transportation Electrification strategic investment plan and urge you to adapt resolution 31971 and pass Council bill 119895.,27,,
236,0.97,1409.708,1423.021,It is imperative that Seattle city light take steps to support the integration of this new vote.,27,,
237,0.97,1423.021,1436.034,Planning is imperative to ensure benefits accrue to all customers and low-income households who are disproportionately impacted by air pollution and higher transportation energy burdens.,27,,
238,0.97,1436.034,1445.076,The investment areas were developed through meaningful input from Stakeholders and community members and align with community needs.,27,,
239,0.97,1445.076,1456.655,"The plan includes several commitments by Seattle city like, including to continue inclusive collaboration geared towards developing programs that advance racial equity.",27,,
240,0.97,1456.655,1464.763,To integrate command site components and new offerings to avoid or reduce the need for traditional transmission systems.,27,,
241,0.97,1464.763,1471.102,This is essential to support greater access to affordable energy for Seattle city light customers.,27,,
242,0.97,1471.102,1487.819,"And to continue shaping Metrics through our Participatory process that will help evaluate equitable access, reduce carbon emissions and other important factors that relate to transportation Electrification utility investment.",27,,
243,0.97,1487.819,1500.465,These are essential components of transportation planning and will help guide Seattle city light's program to design an implementation in collaboration with state cultures and environmental justice communities moving forward.,27,,
244,0.97,1500.465,1502.334,"Thank you, Annabelle.",28,,
245,0.97,1502.334,1506.571,Next up we have Kimberly followed by Robin Briggs.,28,,
246,0.97,1506.571,1509.007,And Robin Briggs is our last Speaker.,28,,
247,0.97,1509.007,1509.841,"Go ahead, Kimberly.",28,,
248,0.97,1509.841,1513.545,"Thank you, city council.",29,,
249,0.97,1513.545,1521.753,"My name is Kimberly, I live on Capitol Hill and I'm Commenting on resolution 31971.",29,,
250,0.97,1521.753,1529.294,Evs are very sexy and they don't require any major changes or sacrifices for people who drive or from anyone at all really.,29,,
251,0.97,1529.294,1536.902,That's actually a problem because we're at a point in the climate crisis when Evs are not going to save us.,29,,
252,0.97,1536.902,1540.805,They're not zero emissions when you look at the by-products.,29,,
253,0.97,1540.805,1546.011,And easy wins in the climate crisis are hardly ever the most effective solutions.,29,,
254,0.97,1546.011,1561.693,"Unfortunately, it took a pandemic for us to see one very effective solution when at the start of Lockdown people drove their personal vehicles a lot less and within a week or two our air quality improved by undeniably significant measures.",29,,
255,0.97,1561.693,1565.03,That wasn't a ten-year Timeframe like this proposal.,29,,
256,0.97,1565.03,1565.697,It took only weeks.,29,,
257,0.97,1565.697,1575.407,"Most drivers could drive less, most of them could, but communicating that is not sexy and too many of us appear to not even want to try to ask that.",29,,
258,0.97,1575.407,1584.983,"So we do need a campaign, something like the Federal Government created when it encouraged people to grow victory gardens to support the war effort in World War II.",29,,
259,0.97,1584.983,1587.852,We need more and better public transit.,29,,
260,0.97,1587.852,1595.26,"We need safe and accessible bike and walk routes, and we need people to shift modes and we need to encourage all of us to get behind that.",29,,
261,0.97,1595.26,1600.632,"It could take more than weeks, but it wouldn't take a decade and would be a real win for Oefrn.",29,,
262,0.97,1600.632,1607.372,"So if you vote yes, please keep front of mind that this easy win is not an effective win.",29,,
263,0.97,1607.372,1618.183,"Quick Proesscript, Evs are and will continue to be expensive so the assertion that this is good on equity is very hard for me to believe.",29,,
264,0.97,1618.183,1618.85,Thanss for your time.,29,,
265,0.97,1618.85,1620.085,"Thank you, Kimberly.",30,,
266,0.97,1620.085,1624.255,And our last Speaker is Robin Briggs.,30,,
267,0.97,1624.255,1624.856,"Go ahead, Robin.",30,,
268,0.97,1624.856,1629.26,"Hi, my name is Robin Briggs, and I live on Capitol Hill.",31,,
269,0.97,1629.26,1638.036,"Climate change is my biggest concern, and I'm all in favor of preparing the grid for transportation Electrification and putting in place the charging infrastructure we are going to need.",31,,
270,0.97,1638.036,1644.442,Seattle city light should be able to pay incentives to accelerate the move to Electrification.,31,,
271,0.97,1644.442,1651.483,I am concerned about the plan of paying financial incentives to private companies who are installing Chargers.,31,,
272,0.97,1651.483,1664.796,"We should make it as easy for them as possible to get to the permitting process, but let's make sure that Metro, the schools and other public entities have the help they need before.",31,,
273,0.97,1664.796,1669.467,I think Seattle city light should include incentives for electric bikes.,31,,
274,0.97,1669.467,1681.179,"Electric bikes are electric vehicle that is we often don't consider, but they're a great way of getting around without adding a lot of congestion.",31,,
275,0.97,1681.179,1688.853,"Thank you, Robin, are you finished?",32,,
276,0.97,1688.853,1689.054,Okay.,32,,
277,0.97,1689.054,1690.188,Yes.,33,,
278,0.97,1690.188,1692.524,Thank you very much.,34,,
279,0.97,1692.524,1693.425,"Thank you, Robin.",34,,
280,0.97,1693.425,1702.233,"That concludes our public speakers, so we're going be closing the public comment period and getting into the items of business on our agenda.",34,,
281,0.97,1702.233,1716.714,"Just a reminder to committee members, we did talk the last committee about the Internet for all report and action plan based on the resolution sponsored by Council President Gonzalez and Councilmember Deborah Juarez and me.",34,,
282,0.97,1716.714,1727.859,"So if you have comments on the action plan, send them to my office or to the Seattle Department of information technology in the next week or so.",34,,
283,0.97,1727.859,1728.426,That would be great.,34,,
284,0.97,1728.426,1733.898,Now on the items of business for this agenda today.,34,,
285,0.97,1733.898,1737.535,We'll be considering the first three pieces together.,34,,
286,0.97,1737.535,1744.242,"We'll vote separately on the items, but we're going to read them all into the record at the same time because they all deal with Electrification.",34,,
287,0.97,1744.242,1753.184,"The first two items are subject to possible vote today and getting those to the Monday, October 5, city council meeting.",34,,
288,0.97,1753.184,1754.853,So they're not going to go directly.,34,,
289,0.97,1754.853,1758.99,"On Tuesday there'll be time in the middle until Monday, October 5.",34,,
290,0.97,1758.99,1763.394,That's the plan for these--the resolution and then the ordinance.,34,,
291,0.97,1763.394,1771.503,And then there's a third item which is a draft Council bill that Seattle city light is going to be submitting soon.,34,,
292,0.97,1771.503,1781.179,"But it's related to this Electrification process and so we're going to have the clerk read items one, two, and three into the record and then we'll hear from Seattle city light.",34,,
293,0.97,1781.179,1784.782,We have a couple of presentations.,34,,
294,0.97,1784.782,1788.286,"So go ahead, clerk, and read items one, two, and three into the record please.",34,,
295,0.97,1788.286,1797.428,"Okay, before I do that, I will note for the record that I believe Councilmember Herbold is now in attendance.",35,,
296,0.97,1797.428,1799.397,Thank you.,36,,
297,0.97,1799.397,1816.481,"Item one, resolution 31971 a resolution relating to the city light Department, adopting a transportation Electrification strategic investment plan for the city light Department that will guide the development of the Utilityb strategy and investment priorities related to the Electrification of transportation.",37,,
298,0.97,1816.481,1828.326,For briefing discussion and possible vote.,37,,
299,0.97,1828.326,1863.595,"Item two, council bill 119895, an ordinance relating to the city light Department, granting authority for the Department to offer incentive programs in the Electrification of Transportation for its customers, including the promotion of electric vehicle adoption and advertising programs to promote the Utilityb or rebates and adding a new chapter 21.53 to the Seattle municipal code for briefing, discussion and possible vote.",37,,
300,0.97,1863.595,1878.409,"Item three, presentation on amendment to Seattle municipal code 21.49.090 which currently imposes a barrier to the efficient and timely deployment of electric vehicle charging sites.",37,,
301,0.97,1878.409,1884.983,Scl proposes legislation clarifying Seattle city Lightb discretion to allow additional services on a parcel.,37,,
302,0.97,1884.983,1891.789,For briefing and discussion.,37,,
303,0.97,1891.789,1892.49,Thank you.,38,,
304,0.97,1892.49,1912.143,"And everybody, we do have our city council central staff expert here, Eric, who follows Seattle city light items, and so Eric, if you want to make any introductory comments before hand, or we can just turn it over to Seattle city light to do these presentations.",38,,
305,0.97,1912.143,1914.579,"I'll just take a moment to say, good morning.",39,,
306,0.97,1914.579,1916.481,It's great to be here.,39,,
307,0.97,1916.481,1920.718,I look forward to the presentations.,39,,
308,0.97,1920.718,1926.824,"And I note that, as you pointed out, these pieces of legislation go together.",39,,
309,0.97,1926.824,1933.131,The resolution allows for Council to then pass the ordinance that follows it.,39,,
310,0.97,1933.131,1933.932,So they work in tandem.,39,,
311,0.97,1933.932,1942.44,"That may already have been said, but part of my role is to emphasize those sorts of things.",39,,
312,0.97,1942.44,1948.946,"I'll step back, and as usual, if there are any questions that you would like me to work with the utility, Ly do that.",39,,
313,0.97,1948.946,1949.514,"Thank you, Eric.",40,,
314,0.97,1949.514,1955.386,"I would like to turn it over now to the general manager of Seattle city light, Debra Smith.",40,,

318,0.97,1958.456,1969.634,And I really do want to take a moment to appreciate having a special city like meeting and allowing us to move forward.,41,,
319,0.97,1969.634,1984.949,"In particular, transportation Electrification, and now we've all gotten good at the Acronym, it's been an effort that we've been working on for a long time, as noted by some of the speakers.",41,,
320,0.97,1984.949,1992.79,Started with the rocky mountain work as we were working toward the legislative fix in Olympia that would allow us to offer incentives.,41,,
321,0.97,1992.79,1998.429,I drive an electric vehicle and this summer my husband and I during Covid bought electric bikes.,41,,
322,0.97,1998.429,2002.433,So I get it and really appreciate the value of both.,41,,
323,0.97,2002.433,2010.942,"And I will say, you know, living in Seattle, particularly downtown Seattle, the electric bike serves me incredibly well.",41,,
324,0.97,2010.942,2016.247,So acknowledging all that's been heard and excited to talk with you about these initiatives today.,41,,
325,0.97,2016.247,2026.424,"So I'm going to go ahead and introduce all of staff, all of the staff members that are going to be presenting to you today so that we can get that done up front.",41,,
326,0.97,2026.424,2035.6,"I'll offer just a few opening remarks about items number one and two, the transportation Electrification strategic investment plan, and then I'll turn it over to staff.",41,,
327,0.97,2035.6,2045.276,"So also, just really want to thank all of the Councilmembers, chair Pedersen, for working with us again.",41,,
328,0.97,2045.276,2051.516,And I wanted just to offer a hello to Eric and Toby and thank you for your support in getting us here.,41,,
329,0.97,2051.516,2059.557,"So the staff that we have today, we have a great group presenting for city light.",41,,
330,0.97,2059.557,2063.327,We've got Emeka Anyanwu who is our engineering and innovation officer.,41,,
331,0.97,2063.327,2070.435,"He's been with the city for a couple of years now, and he's just been a fabulous addition to our staff.",41,,
332,0.97,2070.435,2075.74,"As has David Logsdon who I think you met, many of you have met in the past.",41,,
333,0.97,2075.74,2078.81,He is our director of Electrification and strategic technology.,41,,
334,0.97,2078.81,2085.783,"He comes to us from New York and has brought incredible ideas and opportunities to the city in a very, very short time.",41,,
335,0.97,2085.783,2090.788,"Joined us right before Covid, and it's amazing, he has not skipped a beat.",41,,
336,0.97,2090.788,2094.258,"And we've got Victor Couto, the program manager for customer care and energy solutions.",41,,
337,0.97,2094.258,2101.566,"In many ways, he is the individual who has done a lot of the boots on the ground work here.",41,,
338,0.97,2101.566,2103.801,So really appreciate his efforts.,41,,
339,0.97,2103.801,2104.969,"Jenny Levesque, our external communications manager.",41,,
340,0.97,2104.969,2119.283,"And as noted in some of the discussion or the public comment and as will be noted in our presentation, this is really the beginning of an implementation plan, and we have lots of community output to--or input to continue gathering.",41,,
341,0.97,2119.283,2124.255,We are by no means done with that.,41,,
342,0.97,2124.255,2131.729,"In fact, in some ways to Covid slowing down business as usual, it has impacted and did impact our ability to do public outreach.",41,,
343,0.97,2131.729,2137.435,"So we will be continuing to pursue that very, very diligently under Jenny's expertise.",41,,
344,0.97,2137.435,2141.939,"And then Maura, our director of government and legislative affairs.",41,,
345,0.97,2141.939,2146.11,"And she's also, as I noted earlier, our chief technology individual today.",41,,
346,0.97,2146.11,2153.017,"When we move into the open access transmission tariff item, that's a mouthful as well, we call it the oat.",41,,
347,0.97,2153.017,2168.432,"We will have Jim Baggs, who's our compliance officer, Cathy Leone woods, the director of regulatory affairs for city light as well as Melissa Skelton, the strategic advisor in regulatory affairs.",41,,
348,0.97,2168.432,2172.57,And much of the work today has been under Melissa's Tutelage.,41,,
349,0.97,2172.57,2176.04,And then Maura will be helping us along with the technology.,41,,
350,0.97,2176.04,2199.63,"Lastly, we have a Finance item which is much more of a housekeeping item and we'll have Kirsty Grainger, who is city light's chief financial officer, as well as Chris Ruffini, our Finance director, Carston Croff, the manager of financial planning and rates and, of course, Maura Brueger on the Powerpoint.",41,,
351,0.97,2199.63,2202.7,So that's our lineup for today.,41,,
352,0.97,2202.7,2210.975,So city light has long been committed to enabling customer choice in many ways and guaranteeing sustained public value from the utility grid.,41,,
353,0.97,2210.975,2213.077,So we do view the utility grid.,41,,
354,0.97,2213.077,2219.016,"It is an investment that belongs to our community, and we are beholden to make the most value of it as we can.",41,,
355,0.97,2219.016,2238.102,"As an increasing number of city light customers have chosen to go electric and Electrify both fleets and personal vehicles, city light sought to understand and accelerate customer adoption of electric vehicles in a manner that equitably and Sustainably maximizes grid benefits for our customers.",41,,
356,0.97,2238.102,2243.541,"And we did hear from folks during the public comment about, you know, targets, Metrics.",41,,
357,0.97,2243.541,2244.342,It's really challenging.,41,,
358,0.97,2244.342,2250.081,Our role as a public entity is to accelerate and to make possible adoption.,41,,
359,0.97,2250.081,2268.132,"We recognize that personal choice around Electrification, whether it is for public or a private entity that is electrifying fleets, or whether it's you and I at home, those are choice that is get made and our job is to create the infrastructure that allows them make that choice.",41,,
360,0.97,2268.132,2280.711,"As noted, there are cost benefit values to electric vehicles and we know that adoption will continue to increase as price points come down and as access to charging infrastructure becomes more available.",41,,
361,0.97,2280.711,2287.084,So city light envisions a utility of the future that's responsive to the wants and needs of the community members.,41,,
362,0.97,2287.084,2291.355,Most impacted by environmental and social inequities.,41,,
363,0.97,2291.355,2293.257,We do take incredibly seriously.,41,,
364,0.97,2293.257,2303.034,We operate a modernized grid that enables Realtime smart technology interaction and provides economic opportunities through infrastructure investments and upgrades.,41,,
365,0.97,2303.034,2313.911,"With our clean energy, because we are very fortunate as a city to have access to our Hydropower system, primarily from Skagit and our boundary dams.",41,,
366,0.97,2313.911,2324.055,"The Pacific Northwest as a whole is in a unique position to Electrify the transportation sector and to deliver a triple win for our customers, the requirement and the utility.",41,,
367,0.97,2324.055,2348.379,"And as noted, in response to those needs in recent state legislation as city light developed a transportation Electrification strategic investment plan for 2021 to 2024 to offer customer incentives and promote the Electrification of transportation to ensure that we bring maximum value and convenience to our customer owners as we enable this transition.",41,,
368,0.97,2348.379,2358.122,We're here today to present this plan to you and to seek your support for our transportation Electrification-Based legislative packages so that we can begin this crucial work.,41,,
369,0.97,2358.122,2363.094,So Emeka and David will take you through about a 20-Minute presentation covering our process.,41,,
370,0.97,2363.094,2373.771,"We have lots of time left over for questions, and so we welcome them and look forward to hearing from you.",41,,
371,0.97,2373.771,2374.038,Gentlemen?,41,,
372,0.97,2374.038,2376.774,"All right, thank you, Debra.",42,,
373,0.97,2376.774,2381.746,"And so, again, we appreciate the opportunity to bring this work before you all today.",42,,
374,0.97,2381.746,2393.491,The resolution and ordinance we have before you today were developed as I think has been pointed out earlier in response to the 2019 passage of House bill 1512 by the Washington state Legislature.,42,,
375,0.97,2393.491,2407.805,"And that bill grants utilities the authority to provide customer incentives following to drive the adoption of following the adoption of a transportation Electrification plan by our governing board which, of course, is the city council so.",42,,
376,0.97,2407.805,2423.32,"The resolution, as Eric pointed out, ADOPTS our transportation Electrification strategic investment plan, and then the ordinance AMENDS the Seattle municipal code to activate that ability for us to promote transportation Electrification and provide incentives to our customers.",42,,
377,0.97,2423.32,2437.668,"So I think the thing to start out with, Maura, if you'll go to the next slide please, is really to point out sort of the main Takeaways from today, the things we hope everybody walks away from this discussion with.",42,,
378,0.97,2437.668,2446.644,"The first thing is, again, and this can't be said too strongly, specially in light of some of the comments, our focus has been to listen to and engage with communities.",42,,
379,0.97,2446.644,2460.191,"You know, we need to establish our approach for how we're going to set our priorities, and we are intent on minimizing earlier premature conclusions to avoid confirmation bias or doing what sort of feels right just to us.",42,,
380,0.97,2460.191,2465.596,And so we intend to be accountable to an ongoing process of community engagement.,42,,
381,0.97,2465.596,2484.915,"You know, key to that is that city light strives to incorporate the voices of environmental justice Communit who is have historically been left excluded, left out of these conversations about how transportation Electrification is planned and developed.",42,,
382,0.97,2484.915,2493.39,"So by listening to those people experiencing environmental inequities, we think that will result in solution that is meet the needs of all of our customers.",42,,
383,0.97,2493.39,2509.74,"City like--at City light we're committed to serving our black, indigenous and other persons of color, immigrants, refugees, people experiencing low incomes, youth and English language learners are folks who have English not as their first language.",42,,
384,0.97,2509.74,2514.445,We are centering those needs and making them a priority in our work here.,42,,
385,0.97,2514.445,2517.348,That leads us to the second key point.,42,,
386,0.97,2517.348,2524.021,We Resoundingly heard over the course of several year that is transit is a top priority.,42,,
387,0.97,2524.021,2529.426,"In the conversation about mode shift, I think that is one of the places that we gain efficiency.",42,,
388,0.97,2529.426,2536.033,"Other modes of transportation matter, but public transit takes the cake and makes the most impact on these communities.",42,,
389,0.97,2536.033,2551.282,"So the next thing, again, is to reiterate that Transportatin Electrification for us is not about trading in internal combustion vehicles for Evs, single occupancy vehicles are not the preferred solution, they're not the future.",42,,
390,0.97,2551.282,2560.824,"We may have a temporary Detour for transitional reasons, including, of course, the pandemic where folks are making choices around their comfort level with riding mass transit.",42,,
391,0.97,2560.824,2565.663,"But the long-term path is about shared modes, shared production and ensuring equitable access.",42,,
392,0.97,2565.663,2574.471,And then the last item on the slide is the Foundational one.,42,,
393,0.97,2574.471,2584.581,The grid is the platform that gets to the future we envision.,42,,
394,0.97,2584.581,2589.72,It really is the connective tissue that binds together every part of our future together.,42,,
395,0.97,2589.72,2594.325,So it's a key part of how we get to an equitable energy future.,42,,
396,0.97,2594.325,2598.495,"So in order to achieve that, it's not our grandparents grid, so to speak.",42,,
397,0.97,2598.495,2601.599,The new grid needs to be dynamic.,42,,
398,0.97,2601.599,2603.434,"It needs to be distributed, flexible and smart.",42,,
399,0.97,2603.434,2608.305,It needs to be up to the task of getting us to that future that we desire.,42,,
400,0.97,2608.305,2613.31,So next I'll talk a little bit about this fits into the city's big picture.,42,,
401,0.97,2613.31,2616.714,If you can go to the next slide.,42,,
402,0.97,2616.714,2623.754,So we've really engaged on a fairly deep citywide coordination on transportation Electrification.,42,,
403,0.97,2623.754,2640.437,City light's vision and goals for this future electrified transportation system as talked about in the plan are aligned with and support our city's climate goals and the updated citywide Electrification strategy which will be finalized later this year.,42,,
404,0.97,2640.437,2654.451,That citywide Te plan is a Multidepartment effort to Electrify it at scale and to tackle poor air quality from the combustion of dirty fossil fuels.,42,,
405,0.97,2654.451,2664.828,We look to implement strategy that is will reduce fossil fuel consumption through Electrification and supporting the outcome of the green new deal.,42,,
406,0.97,2664.828,2678.475,"City light, the office of Sustainability and environment and Seattle Department of transportation are leading that citywide transportation Electrification effort in collaboration with several other departments across the city.",42,,
407,0.97,2678.475,2683.514,So our strategic investment plan is a critical component of that citywide plan.,42,,
408,0.97,2683.514,2706.103,"And in order to achieve those ambitious goals set out in that plan that learn see late they are year, it's essential that we have the authority that city light as a utility have the authority to offer customer incentives and services for transportation Electrification, as well as the authority to promote electric vehicle adoption and advertise our utility services, which is codified in the legislation.",42,,
409,0.97,2706.103,2710.441,"And so we'll go to the next slide, please.",42,,
410,0.97,2710.441,2723.754,"So Finally, before I hand it off, I'll just say that as we look at where we are today, I think it's important to frame where we are relative to our peers with this work.",42,,
411,0.97,2723.754,2729.993,Snohomish Pud took home the power and Vista have had their plans already approved by the government bodies.,42,,
412,0.97,2729.993,2733.097,We understand that Puget sound energy is planning to submit their plans.,42,,
413,0.97,2733.097,2740.37,"So when you look at our neighbors here in the region, it's clear that we need to keep on pace and not fall behind our peers.",42,,
414,0.97,2740.37,2742.506,And we certainly don't want to be last.,42,,
415,0.97,2742.506,2748.545,I think we have a mandate from the Council from our review panel from our customer owners to be a regional leader.,42,,
416,0.97,2748.545,2758.989,And so how we be a regional leader is certainly not to be last in getting past this milestone so that we can get to the work of delivering Transportational education to our customers.,42,,
417,0.97,2758.989,2761.625,"So with that, I'm going to hand it off to David.",42,,
418,0.97,2761.625,2770.033,And David will walk us through the path we've taken to get to the plan.,42,,
419,0.97,2770.033,2770.234,David?,42,,
420,0.97,2770.234,2770.701,"Thank you, Emeka.",43,,
421,0.97,2770.701,2775.873,And I wanted to just tag along on that NOTE on regional leadership.,43,,
422,0.97,2775.873,2780.043,"David Logsdon, director of Electrification and strategic technology here at Seattle city light.",43,,
423,0.97,2780.043,2784.848,"Debra mentioned I moved here at the start of this year, January, right before Covid hit.",43,,
424,0.97,2784.848,2790.42,Came most recently from New York and con Edison where I worked on Electrification initiatives.,43,,
425,0.97,2790.42,2803.0,And I just wanted to say a big part of what drove me to move my family over here and work with Debra on these initiatives has been the ability we have to lead in the region on transportation Electrification.,43,,
426,0.97,2803.0,2805.869,The conditions are absolutely right in the region.,43,,
427,0.97,2805.869,2808.338,The policy support is in place this.,43,,
428,0.97,2808.338,2810.207,Plan represents Seattle city light's contributions towards that.,43,,
429,0.97,2810.207,2815.946,"Looking at this slide, I think one of the key things to note is the extensive history that leads up to today.",43,,
430,0.97,2815.946,2819.082,The buildup goes back at least five years.,43,,
431,0.97,2819.082,2820.717,And that's really looking at 2015.,43,,
432,0.97,2820.717,2826.523,You see city light completed a study to look at the implications of Ev adopt in our service area.,43,,
433,0.97,2826.523,2831.929,We did this work in collaboration with energy and environment economics and other Northwest utilities.,43,,
434,0.97,2831.929,2838.535,And the goal there was really to understand the environmental grid and economic benefits from transportation Electrification.,43,,
435,0.97,2838.535,2847.144,That study had a number of key findings that have continued to influence how we look at transportation Electrification and are reflected in the strategic investment plan.,43,,
436,0.97,2847.144,2863.66,"One of the key components I wanted to highlight was the study found over the life of each electric vehicle, there was a net benefit of $1,250 per personal vehicle.",43,,
437,0.97,2863.66,2870.1,So the significant benefits for our customer owners are a big driver for the benefits that can come from transportation Electrification.,43,,
438,0.97,2870.1,2879.81,"And based on those promising initial results, city light continued to invest in initial pilot programs.",43,,
439,0.97,2879.81,2883.513,We had pilot programs primarily under drive clean Seattle initiative.,43,,
440,0.97,2883.513,2894.024,We added further rigor to our transportation Electrification benefit analysis so built off that analysis done in 2015 with an additional strategy report.,43,,
441,0.97,2894.024,2911.008,"We developed that with rocky this report dived more deeply and looked at the state of the electric mobility market, injected impacts to city light that may come from market adoption of personally owned vehicles, medium heavy fleet vehicles.",43,,
442,0.97,2911.008,2924.554,That work informs the investment value framework and has helped us to identify what we can do with access to Ev adoption and to effectively manage the grid impacts.,43,,
443,0.97,2924.554,2934.631,"This includes preparing for heavy duty Electrification by Partnering with partner who have plans as well as developing new rates, improved customer service strategies for transportation market.",43,,
444,0.97,2934.631,2939.036,And you'll see some of the rate pilots we have later on.,43,,
445,0.97,2939.036,2946.977,And then also strategies around investing and charging infrastructure with emphasis on universal access and continuing to expand coverage.,43,,
446,0.97,2946.977,2956.62,"And then you kind of go, and moving along the Timeline, you see the passage of Washington House bill 1512, which has been mentioned a few times.",43,,
447,0.97,2956.62,2958.288,That passed almost one year ago.,43,,
448,0.97,2958.288,2963.694,That's when we began the work on the plan.,43,,
449,0.97,2963.694,2972.669,"At the start of the building of the plan, we wanted meaningful inclusion across our service area.",43,,
450,0.97,2972.669,2977.641,We wanted to incorporate the environmental justice communities in our work.,43,,
451,0.97,2977.641,2985.449,A racial equity analysis using the city of Seattle tool kit.,43,,
452,0.97,2985.449,2995.425,We developed this plan by really leading with our values and incorporating what we've heard from those environmental Jus'Tis communities and other Stakeholders in phase one outreach.,43,,
453,0.97,2995.425,3012.075,"And to shape the priorities that we're now presenting to Council in this plan, we've--in that outreach, we worked closely with community Stakeholders, other city departments, particularly office of Sustainability and environment, Department of transportation, Department of neighborhoods as well as the Mayor's office.",43,,
454,0.97,3012.075,3024.454,"And you know, we're here today just looking at the Timeline, we're here today to seek city council's approval to activate that statutory authority so as to fully deliver on the strategic investment plan.",43,,
455,0.97,3024.454,3040.604,"Following that, we're ready to proceed to the next wave of work, a second phase of community outreach so we can continue to engage more deeply with communities to inform the program design efforts as we build up the portfolio of new programs and services that we'll be implementing.",43,,
456,0.97,3040.604,3044.875,So that's the process perspective and some of the rich history that has led to the day.,43,,
457,0.97,3044.875,3052.816,"And on the next slide, I'd like to take us back to the planned development itself a little more deeply and talk about how we approached it.",43,,
458,0.97,3052.816,3061.124,"We centered on our values, so I wanted to share those actual values, and we'll talk a little bit more about how they were reflected in the development of the plan.",43,,
459,0.97,3061.124,3069.232,The core of plan development was to get a square on these key strategies and values.,43,,
460,0.97,3069.232,3071.368,The first of those is equity.,43,,
461,0.97,3071.368,3077.908,"With equity, we want to conduct environmental justice, Community-Centered collaboration and engagement from the start.",43,,
462,0.97,3077.908,3084.681,That's mostly complete with the phase one outreach effort I talked about and we'll be talking about again in a moment.,43,,
463,0.97,3084.681,3094.491,"This is really keel for us and we need to Prioritize positive outcomes and minimize harm, especially for Underserved communities.",43,,
464,0.97,3094.491,3095.659,Next value is environment.,43,,
465,0.97,3095.659,3107.504,We heard in the public comments quite a bit about the key driver that transportation Electrification can serve as in combatting overall greenhouse gas emissions in our area.,43,,
466,0.97,3107.504,3110.073,Transportation represents two-thirds of the greenhouse gas emissions in the region.,43,,
467,0.97,3110.073,3116.613,And we also want to tap the air quality and public health benefits from reduced traffic congestion.,43,,
468,0.97,3116.613,3125.489,"And many of the fleets and transit opportunities that we seek to Electrify do have big impacts, especially in environmental justice communities.",43,,
469,0.97,3125.489,3127.023,Third value is the grid.,43,,
470,0.97,3127.023,3131.661,The grid is the platform that enables all of what we're talking about with this plan.,43,,
471,0.97,3131.661,3134.03,We want to optimize that shared asset.,43,,
472,0.97,3134.03,3135.265,We want to avoid upgrades.,43,,
473,0.97,3135.265,3142.706,We want to maximize the benefits of transportation Electrification fully.,43,,
474,0.97,3142.706,3149.746,"So in the next slide, we can start to see how these values really became manifest in the development of the plan.",43,,
475,0.97,3149.746,3158.288,And that's primarily tied to the extensive Stakeholder outreach we conducted and already and we continue to conduct as we move on to the next stage.,43,,
476,0.97,3158.288,3161.391,So we really started with the communities that we serve.,43,,
477,0.97,3161.391,3176.773,"And in the past, Seattle city light has received clear and direct feedback that we need to center our offerings on the communities we serve and especially communities experiencing environmental and social inequities in our planning process.",43,,
478,0.97,3176.773,3200.463,"So we took that to heart, and we've really built the process around starting by first conducting the racial equity analysis and then engaging deeply with community Stakeholders, especially environmental justice community leaders and other Stakeholder groups throughout the area.",43,,
479,0.97,3200.463,3215.912,"We share the draft with over 40 groups, including Community-Based organizations in all Council districts, multiple commercial local government nonprofit fleets, labor unions, labor councils.",43,,
480,0.97,3215.912,3220.617,"We met with shared mobility Stakeholders, taxi companies.",43,,
481,0.97,3220.617,3224.588,And what we heard Resoundingly was we should focus on key priorities.,43,,
482,0.97,3224.588,3225.121,I'll put these in order.,43,,
483,0.97,3225.121,3232.062,There's a lot more detail on this in the community and Stakeholder summary that's included in the legislative package.,43,,
484,0.97,3232.062,3246.643,"Those ranked priorities that we heard from Stakeholders were number one, educating and continuing to work with communities as we developed the plan as we create an actual implementation plan based on strategic priorities.",43,,
485,0.97,3246.643,3250.146,Number two is Prioritizing public transit.,43,,
486,0.97,3250.146,3256.119,"Number three was electrifying fleets, especially those in the Duwamish valley.",43,,
487,0.97,3256.119,3267.23,That's particularly Impactful as those fleets do operate in environmental justice communities and have a big potential to reduce emissions and mitigate health impacts in those communities.,43,,
488,0.97,3267.23,3273.803,And fleet programs and incentives are a great way to impact a large number of vehicles fairly quickly.,43,,
489,0.97,3273.803,3282.879,"Number four, expand At-Home and near home charging for multifamily residents to allow for more equitable access.",43,,
490,0.97,3282.879,3284.114,And Electrify high mileage vehicles.,43,,
491,0.97,3284.114,3289.986,They have a big impact as they drive three to four to five more times and miles than regular passenger cars.,43,,
492,0.97,3289.986,3295.525,That's what we heard from the phase one outreach and engagement.,43,,
493,0.97,3295.525,3302.432,"On the slide that Maura's brought up, that's reflected in the strategic priorities we shaped in the plan.",43,,
494,0.97,3302.432,3308.471,"This slide, which we'll stay on, it presents the investment priorities we're Ebringing to Council today.",43,,
495,0.97,3308.471,3312.142,These are the priority that is were shaped directly by outreach.,43,,
496,0.97,3312.142,3322.552,"And you know, that stack I read from what we heard from community, if you read from top to bottom of these slides, that's basically, essentially, 100% lines up with what we heard from communities.",43,,
497,0.97,3322.552,3328.158,And each of these is paired with equity outcomes we intend to achieve as we move on towards implementation.,43,,
498,0.97,3328.158,3340.47,What we can do now is work our way down from the top here and we can start with those areas of most importance as we move on to the next phase of working with communities to build out a full portfolio.,43,,
499,0.97,3340.47,3345.008,"So number one, and this again matches everything that we heard from communities.",43,,
500,0.97,3345.008,3350.947,Number one is continue to educate and connect with communities to hear those priorities and reflect those priorities in our work.,43,,
501,0.97,3350.947,3356.219,We want to make sure communities are aware of the benefits and how they can access them.,43,,
502,0.97,3356.219,3362.826,"And to that end, I mentioned a little bit that we've concluded our phase one outreach.",43,,
503,0.97,3362.826,3373.203,The phase two outreach and engagement effort we hope to undertake will be focused on deeper and more meaningful engagement with community members and leaders.,43,,
504,0.97,3373.203,3374.237,"We're hoping to build relationships, educate.",43,,
505,0.97,3374.237,3375.939,The outreach is going to go beyond that.,43,,
506,0.97,3375.939,3383.58,"In this phase two we are going to work with community Stakeholders on topics that get into program design, development and implementation.",43,,
507,0.97,3383.58,3388.118,We want to truly collaborate with community members right from the start and ensure we meet their needs.,43,,
508,0.97,3388.118,3393.556,"Continuing through the priorities, you can see transit's a teardrop priority.",43,,
509,0.97,3393.556,3399.629,"And I'm going to apologize, I didn't see it, but we have a hand raised at the moment.",43,,
510,0.97,3399.629,3400.864,"Councilmember Herbold, I believe.",43,,
511,0.97,3400.864,3401.431,Thank you.,44,,
512,0.97,3401.431,3402.398,"Chair Pedersen, may I?",44,,
513,0.97,3402.398,3403.333,"Yes, please.",45,,
514,0.97,3403.333,3406.269,Thank you so much.,46,,
515,0.97,3406.269,3430.26,"Just looking at the strategic investment priorities, I'm curious as to whether or not Maritime vehicles made the list, Whetheror not you're talking about ships or ships for purposes of cargo or cruise ships.",46,,
516,0.97,3430.26,3443.306,I don't see these being Prioritized and just wondering was that a function of people not being asked or just people--were they asked and they didn't rate that as a priority?,46,,
517,0.97,3443.306,3453.316,I think it did come up in some of the community priorities in terms of public transit and especially in the environmental impacts that people hope to see there.,47,,
518,0.97,3453.316,3457.32,And I think you'll see some more on that as we get on to the milestone slide.,47,,
519,0.97,3457.32,3464.861,I believe we'll be talking in a moment about some of the existing work we've done with Washington state ferries and hope to expand on.,47,,
520,0.97,3464.861,3467.897,Then the partnership with port of Seattle.,47,,
521,0.97,3467.897,3476.439,"And I think that in some of the outreach we heard from, I want to say it was South Park community, asked about E-Boats.",47,,
522,0.97,3476.439,3485.782,So I think that we're keyed up to work with Maritime applications.,47,,
523,0.97,3485.782,3492.689,So that was a transportation use that people were given the opportunity to Prioritize?,48,,
524,0.97,3492.689,3493.056,Yes.,49,,
525,0.97,3493.056,3498.127,It was on the list and they just didn't choose it?,50,,
526,0.97,3498.127,3498.728,Some did.,51,,
527,0.97,3498.728,3498.995,Yeah --,51,,
528,0.97,3498.995,3503.733,It didn't make it as a top priority?,52,,
529,0.97,3503.733,3507.003,I would say not quite the top.,53,,
530,0.97,3507.003,3513.409,"You know, public transit is a top priority with a focus on buses and access.",53,,
531,0.97,3513.409,3517.914,We did hear from some Stakeholders and definitely an interest in the environmental benefits.,53,,
532,0.97,3517.914,3518.147,Okay.,54,,
533,0.97,3518.147,3518.448,Thank you.,54,,
534,0.97,3518.448,3518.681,Sure.,55,,
535,0.97,3518.681,3522.852,"And if I may, it's in your plan?",56,,
536,0.97,3522.852,3523.186,"Yes, yes.",57,,
537,0.97,3523.186,3526.556,"Okay, so that's the important thing that it is in your plan.",58,,
538,0.97,3526.556,3528.057,"Yes, you'll see that.",59,,
539,0.97,3528.057,3529.459,In addition to these others.,60,,
540,0.97,3529.459,3542.472,"Yeah, so we've got existing work with port of Seattle, and we're working with them on their clean energy strategic master plan as well as Washington state ferries on their push to Electrify the ferries.",61,,
541,0.97,3542.472,3543.072,"Good, thank you.",62,,
542,0.97,3543.072,3543.673,Sure.,63,,
543,0.97,3543.673,3567.931,"For more than just a--to quickly layer on to that--for more than just a transportation perspective, from an emissions perspective, the work we're doing at the port on the Seattle waterfront clean energy strategic plan really targets a place where we have emissions in some of those communities that have been historically most affected by emissions.",64,,
544,0.97,3567.931,3575.638,So that's very much a priority for us.,64,,
545,0.97,3575.638,3576.105,Good.,65,,
546,0.97,3576.105,3577.774,"Okay, I'll continue on here.",65,,
547,0.97,3577.774,3579.008,So we talked about transit.,65,,
548,0.97,3579.008,3584.414,"We've talked about fleets and fleets, as we've said, represent a significant source of air and carbon emissions.",65,,
549,0.97,3584.414,3587.917,A great place to start and aligned with what we heard from community.,65,,
550,0.97,3587.917,3594.357,And then we've got a wide variety of Multimodal areas for personal ability.,65,,
551,0.97,3594.357,3600.997,"We're going to continue reducing barriers to access, especially for those in Multiunit dwellings.",65,,
552,0.97,3600.997,3607.37,We're also going to work to include Anti-Displacement strategies.,65,,
553,0.97,3607.37,3611.541,Communities can enjoy the benefits where they live in work while staying in place.,65,,
554,0.97,3611.541,3620.75,"These are our priorities, and we're committed to ensuring our resource allocation matches these priorities as we move toward implementation.",65,,
555,0.97,3620.75,3624.787,We're going to be basing those on ongoing community feedback.,65,,
556,0.97,3624.787,3630.193,And we'll be including framework for how those Comup cans hold us accountable.,65,,
557,0.97,3630.193,3643.973,"So on the next and I believe one of the final slides, you're going to see how some of the initial milestones we'll achieve across these areas.",65,,
558,0.97,3643.973,3647.877,"Milestones, based on the investment priorities from the last slide.",65,,
559,0.97,3647.877,3666.229,"The plan delivers a process, and we aren't at the stage of a full portfolio--these milestones are going to continue to be expanded on as we implement the four year plan which covers 2021 through 2024.",65,,
560,0.97,3666.229,3685.348,"The types of program offerings are going to fit into three major categories, incentives in the forms of rebates, financing, discounts for Customer-Owned transportation Electrification equipment.",65,,
561,0.97,3685.348,3687.917,Those support infrastructure rather than the vehicles themselves.,65,,
562,0.97,3687.917,3689.686,"And then in addition to incentives, services.",65,,
563,0.97,3689.686,3698.361,City light is going to provide services to encourage and enable transportation Electrification.,65,,
564,0.97,3698.361,3699.128,And then ongoing outreach.,65,,
565,0.97,3699.128,3702.598,"We've talked about that a lot already, especially with the next stage of outreach.",65,,
566,0.97,3702.598,3712.108,So the authority for this plan is going to be included in city light's minute budgets and in accordance with laws and limitations.,65,,
567,0.97,3712.108,3721.284,"It's going to lead to financial benefit for our customer owners, especially as the retail revenue from the new sales are expected to be greater than the long-term cost to deliver the plan.",65,,
568,0.97,3721.284,3725.555,This will lower rates and provide an overall benefit to all customers.,65,,
569,0.97,3725.555,3732.795,I'm going to hand the microphone back to Emeka to talk about this slide a little more and to wrap us up.,65,,
570,0.97,3732.795,3733.396,"Thanks again, David.",66,,
571,0.97,3733.396,3740.136,And so I will try to kind of get us to the finish line here pretty quickly.,66,,
572,0.97,3740.136,3746.375,"And just to take a Cue from my colleague, David, I will also say, like him, I am a Seattle transplant.",66,,
573,0.97,3746.375,3749.312,Came to Seattle city light about two and a half years ago.,66,,
574,0.97,3749.312,3757.453,"And like David, you know, I came here from the Midwest because I saw the promise of this work in Seattle.",66,,
575,0.97,3757.453,3766.696,And the opportunity for us to really lead regionally and nationally in this space.,66,,
576,0.97,3766.696,3770.099,"In closing, I'll tie the milestones back to the Takeaways we started with.",66,,
577,0.97,3770.099,3778.074,We do want to listen to our communities to set the priorities.,66,,
578,0.97,3778.074,3780.443,Community outreach is at the core of the plan.,66,,
579,0.97,3780.443,3784.013,You see that in that pink bar two-thirds of the way down.,66,,
580,0.97,3784.013,3791.387,So this is really a feedback loop that is helping us Prioritize work and goals on an ongoing basis.,66,,
581,0.97,3791.387,3803.833,"I would urge folks to look at these specific programs or projects that are mentioned here, certainly not as all inclusive or exhaustive of everything we expect to do whether in the four-year window or beyond.",66,,
582,0.97,3803.833,3810.473,It really is just us having that right feedback loop with our communities to know what we should be working on.,66,,
583,0.97,3810.473,3818.214,"As some of the speakers, of course, have pointed out, we did set a goal to install DC fast Chargers.",66,,
584,0.97,3818.214,3819.148,We have 16 in place.,66,,
585,0.97,3819.148,3821.117,All will be Online as of October.,66,,
586,0.97,3821.117,3828.925,"And we will--we expect to have, we are on track to have 21 of them in place and Online by the first quarter of next year.",66,,
587,0.97,3828.925,3836.132,And really a lot of that delay was owing to the pandemic and some of the construction delays that came from that.,66,,
588,0.97,3836.132,3846.209,But it's also really important to note that in doing that work we were insistent that we not sacrifice community input in the process of deploying these.,66,,
589,0.97,3846.209,3860.523,So we worked closely with our communities and listened to their needs even as we've gone through the process and not been willing to sort of forego that for--to get a result or an outcome.,66,,
590,0.97,3860.523,3869.332,So our strategic partnerships around transit really reflect the community feedback you heard from one of our partners at King County about that in the comment period.,66,,
591,0.97,3869.332,3883.045,"And so it's also our commitment to electrifying commercial, government and nonprofit fleets which all deliver substantial environmental benefits for impacted communities and are a good bang for the buck and up front values.",66,,
592,0.97,3883.045,3885.181,But transit is a top priority.,66,,
593,0.97,3885.181,3891.487,We do need to just say no to one to one Ev conversion.,66,,
594,0.97,3891.487,3901.163,"You can see that initial commitment to electrifying buses, ferries as asked by the Councilmember earlier, and certainly over public transit is a priority for us.",66,,
595,0.97,3901.163,3904.5,"King County Metro, like I said, is a close partner.",66,,
596,0.97,3904.5,3910.373,We are building on that partnership and evolving the customer relationship as we do so.,66,,
597,0.97,3910.373,3917.813,We're working on strong partnership and strong collaboration with the port of Seattle and have good relationships and partnerships with the Washington state ferries as well.,66,,
598,0.97,3917.813,3923.619,So making a lot of progress in that sense and Prioritizing transit.,66,,
599,0.97,3923.619,3932.261,"And then Finally, I can't emphasize how much the grid is essential and crucial to enabling future Electrification.",66,,
600,0.97,3932.261,3935.364,It is the platform.,66,,
601,0.97,3935.364,3947.009,"There are substantial benefits from Electrification, but it can substantially increase in places and spots on the grid at the regional scale.",66,,
602,0.97,3947.009,3955.651,"So we need to modernize and develop the grid of the future really to allow for, manage and maximize the benefits of Electrification.",66,,
603,0.97,3955.651,3958.254,So that's where our good modernization plan and work comes in.,66,,
604,0.97,3958.254,3961.424,You see that in the bottom center of your screen.,66,,
605,0.97,3961.424,3965.328,That is a pivotal milestone for us is to get that work done.,66,,
606,0.97,3965.328,3975.104,That work will be undertaken in parallel to this plan and will be a key Enabler for everything this plan aims to achieve.,66,,
607,0.97,3975.104,3979.342,I would say especially maintaining and enhancing equity in our energy system.,66,,
608,0.97,3979.342,3989.919,We must also examine and Rework existing policies so they don't Stan in the way of our customer owners as they make the choice to Electrify.,66,,
609,0.97,3989.919,4011.64,"The ongoing work with Sdot, Osc and others for a master infrastructure plan, that will seek to streamline the processes for installing this transportation Electrification charging infrastructure including permitting, easements and interconnection and service upgrade processes.",66,,
610,0.97,4011.64,4014.043,Those process innovations will enable expedient and safe innovations.,66,,
611,0.97,4014.043,4021.05,"With that, I think I'm to the end of the transportation Electrification and strategic investment plan specifics.",66,,
612,0.97,4021.05,4024.754,"Councilmember Strauss, I see you have a hand up.",66,,
613,0.97,4024.754,4025.388,Yes.,67,,
614,0.97,4025.388,4027.857,"Yeah, go ahead Councilmember Strauss.",68,,
615,0.97,4027.857,4028.19,Thank you.,69,,
616,0.97,4028.19,4034.063,"Emeka and David, this is such a fantastic presentation and I really appreciate all of your hard work.",69,,
617,0.97,4034.063,4042.004,"From the backgrounds that both of you have, it looks like Seattle has different weather today, Emeka, a sunny day.",69,,
618,0.97,4042.004,4043.939,And you're a little bit more cloudy.,69,,
619,0.97,4043.939,4052.214,"Both of you said that you are transplants to the city, and being somebody that's born and raised in the city, I can say that you are now a Seattleite.",69,,
620,0.97,4052.214,4064.126,"It's not my--it's not for me to give you, but I have to say that the intellect and perspective that you bring to our city is what makes us--what puts us on the cutting edge.",69,,
621,0.97,4064.126,4067.263,And so we couldn't be doing this without you.,69,,
622,0.97,4067.263,4075.07,One of the things that I heard that you said is that the Electrification of vehicles is a benefit to all customers.,69,,
623,0.97,4075.07,4098.727,"And I really want to highlight--raise this back to the top and highlight this, because we know as energy efficiency makes great strides, whether it's light bulbs or Weatherization or solar panels on people's roofs, we understand that we have a greater ability to use our clean energy.",69,,
624,0.97,4098.727,4112.141,"And with city light being a carbon neutral electric source, this has--this allows us to have immense impacts.",69,,
625,0.97,4112.141,4134.296,"And so the additional load from electrical vehicles being able to use that load for electrical vehicles, granted, there are Externalities of electric vehicles, it is overall a better way for--it is better to use electricity than our carbon and gasoline.",69,,
626,0.97,4134.296,4147.476,"And so, I guess, one of my questions is, looking at--and you began to address this with transit, with the port and with the ferries.",69,,
627,0.97,4147.476,4160.022,I understand that we have the Bainbridge route from the Coleman dock with Washington state ferries is one place they're going to pilot their Electrification.,69,,
628,0.97,4160.022,4165.06,"Fun fact for everyone, you may or may not know this.",69,,
629,0.97,4165.06,4168.597,Our ferries are already electric engines.,69,,
630,0.97,4168.597,4175.971,"They use diesel generators within the ferries, within the engine room, to power their electric engines.",69,,
631,0.97,4175.971,4185.514,"And something that city light shared with me, which is really great, so this is--we can't take credit for understanding this.",69,,
632,0.97,4185.514,4195.09,Is that from the Bertha drilling the waterfront tunnel we have a Substation on the waterfront that can use to do fast charging of our Washington state ferries.,69,,
633,0.97,4195.09,4203.132,"So talk--I guess my questions here are can you speak to electrifying our bus fleet, how we're doing that.",69,,
634,0.97,4203.132,4206.035,"Because those are, again, larger battery that is need to be charged.",69,,
635,0.97,4206.035,4229.325,"How we're going to be working to Electrify our ferry fleet and how are we going to--and Councilmember Herbold touched on this about our port, understanding that the port is also moving through an exercise to see if we can't get, you know, charging--extending the grid over to the terminal in Interbay.",69,,
636,0.97,4229.325,4237.866,"Can you talk specifically about these three areas, how are we working to quickly Electrify our bus fleet?",69,,
637,0.97,4237.866,4244.039,"How are we supporting Washington state ferries at Colman dock, and how we're supporting our port.",69,,
638,0.97,4244.039,4248.51,"I'd love to jump in on that first, Emeka.",70,,
639,0.97,4248.51,4249.178,Okay.,71,,
640,0.97,4249.178,4250.579,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",72,,
641,0.97,4250.579,4260.923,"You know, this is a great question because, you know, we've got transit as a key priority and you say some of the milestones, we had that discussion earlier.",72,,
642,0.97,4260.923,4271.467,"These large transit customers who are seeking to Electrify, they have, you know, they're very important because they have some of the biggest potential impacts on environments and communities and the overall greenhouse gas emissions.",72,,
643,0.97,4271.467,4279.475,That can mean they have the biggest impact on the grid and we have to extensively plan to meet those large additional loads coming over the grid.,72,,
644,0.97,4279.475,4290.653,"So for that reason, we want to partner with these customers as early as possible, especially large customers, to work with them to shape long-term plans around Electrification.",72,,
645,0.97,4290.653,4298.961,"You mentioned a couple different customers, but King County Metro we've got a memorandum of agreement from them on their infrastructure.",72,,
646,0.97,4298.961,4307.803,And we'll keep working with them to explore how that load shows up on the grid and explore strategies that can minimize the load on the grid.,72,,
647,0.97,4307.803,4320.349,"Things like how do they build out their infrastructure, but how do they coordinate charging in a bus Depot to not place maximum strain on the grid which means building up maximum capacity.",72,,
648,0.97,4320.349,4322.918,We want to build efficiently by working with them.,72,,
649,0.97,4322.918,4327.222,We've also got close partnerships with the port of Seattle that we mentioned.,72,,
650,0.97,4327.222,4328.123,We're working with them.,72,,
651,0.97,4328.123,4332.795,We hope to reach a similar agreement that we have with King County Metro.,72,,
652,0.97,4332.795,4340.169,We're working closely with the port to shape--help shape their future Electrification plans and do that in the most efficient way possible.,72,,
653,0.97,4340.169,4348.944,"And then when you mentioned Washington state ferries, when you think about these things, you have loads showing up in similar geography.",72,,
654,0.97,4348.944,4357.953,"Port of Seattle, Washington state ferries, potentially some of the bus charging, heavy duty charging, so we have to plan based on existing capacity.",72,,
655,0.97,4357.953,4362.458,But this ties back to grid modernization.,72,,
656,0.97,4362.458,4377.673,"For Washington state ferries, for instance, we have a plan for initial capacity for ferry charging, but we want to look at the long term and look at it Holistically.",72,,
657,0.97,4377.673,4379.441,And manage those strains on the grid.,72,,
658,0.97,4379.441,4385.914,We want to do that in the most cost effective way.,72,,
659,0.97,4385.914,4390.619,We're looking at how we can manage future load growths in Nontraditional ways.,72,,
660,0.97,4390.619,4403.365,"So you can do, in a lot of cases, what might be called Nonwires alternatives where you're putting resources into place at lower cost.",72,,
661,0.97,4403.365,4405.534,That's something we're closely exploring.,72,,
662,0.97,4405.534,4406.935,"Yeah, thanks, David.",73,,
663,0.97,4406.935,4420.416,"I'll quickly layer on to that to emphasize a point David made in there, which is that a big part of the priority here is Innovating the customer relationship.",73,,
664,0.97,4420.416,4430.726,"The close and early partnership we're talking about with the ferries, with King County Metro, with the port of Seattle are not necessarily your traditional Utility/Customer relationship.",73,,
665,0.97,4430.726,4434.263,But we're Innovating that relationship because it is necessary.,73,,
666,0.97,4434.263,4438.066,"You know, I'm sort of classically trained as an engineer.",73,,
667,0.97,4438.066,4443.539,That's how I started my career.,73,,
668,0.97,4443.539,4444.673,I'm a system thinker.,73,,
669,0.97,4444.673,4453.081,"It's systemic, that structural change that's going to enable the benefits we're seeking to achieve here.",73,,
670,0.97,4453.081,4453.882,Thank you.,74,,
671,0.97,4453.882,4454.349,That's very helpful.,74,,
672,0.97,4454.349,4455.717,And Councilmember Herbold raised this as well.,74,,
673,0.97,4455.717,4465.461,Can you speak a little bit more to our Maritime customers and how we can support them in this work?,74,,
674,0.97,4465.461,4488.717,"Yeah, I mean, I think it begins, like I said, in terms of sort of understanding what they're trying to do and figuring out how do we work with them to ensure that they can accomplish aggressive goals and they can be as aggressive as they want to be with those goals while making sure we don't have unintended consequences of stranded assets or other sort of reliability or stability issues on the grid.",75,,
675,0.97,4488.717,4495.257,"Because, again, those things Ult Matly impact all of our customer who is own the grid together.",75,,
676,0.97,4495.257,4497.993,We want to avoid that.,75,,
677,0.97,4497.993,4521.55,"But the kind of deep partnership--and I really appreciated hearing from our colleague at King County this morning, because really that speaks to sort of that relationship and that deep partnership we have on a very technical and granular level to achieve better outcomes on the back end.",75,,
678,0.97,4521.55,4522.718,"Dobora, please.",75,,
679,0.97,4522.718,4550.279,"We've been working closely with Marshall foster from the office of the waterfront and early on, we made a strong commitment as a city that we would work Cross-Departmentally to make sure the waterfront was--that all of the Maritime activity coming in and out of the waterfront was clearly in our mind both in terms of current Electrification, but also in terms of Infrasructure that would support that over a period of time.",76,,
680,0.97,4550.279,4557.819,"Certainly, the cruise industry and the issues that we're dealing with right now with respect to--as a result of Covid perhaps changed the Timeline on that.",76,,
681,0.97,4557.819,4569.798,"But in no way has the commitment to working closely with that Department, that city Department and others, including Sdot, that has not changed at all.",76,,
682,0.97,4569.798,4571.199,Thank you.,77,,
683,0.97,4571.199,4575.137,That is really an excellent answer to my questions.,77,,
684,0.97,4575.137,4581.843,"Emeka, something you said is the grid is the platform and we need to maximize our benefits.",77,,
685,0.97,4581.843,4598.26,"I was watching Award-Winning Seattle channel last night about some of the first when Snoqualmie falls was having its power installed, it was the first underground powerhouse in the nation.",77,,
686,0.97,4598.26,4608.904,There were some Powerhouses that were put in in the city of Seattle because at that time without the alternating current electricity could only travel a mile at a time.,77,,
687,0.97,4608.904,4623.785,"So some of the Powerhouses that were on the waterfront, Seattleites worried they should have put those generating stations at the top of the hill because otherwise they would have to pump the electricity uphill.",77,,
688,0.97,4623.785,4625.988,Interesting how lack of information sometimes influences how people think.,77,,
689,0.97,4625.988,4634.096,"I guess I just want to come back to what Emeka was saying, which is the grid is the platform.",77,,
690,0.97,4634.096,4642.571,And you shared the Micro Grids and the importance that we don't overload our overall grid as we make some of these transitions.,77,,
691,0.97,4642.571,4648.076,And I just want to highlight that that process innovation is what's going to keep us at the cutting edge.,77,,
692,0.97,4648.076,4654.349,And I just want to highlight and compliment you and raise up your work for--that you're doing here.,77,,
693,0.97,4654.349,4691.119,"One of the things that you discussed is the multiple services for one charging place, and you also kind of talked about whether it's the ferries, the cruise and the buses, can you speak a little bit more about the importance of this and how--and why it's important that, for instance, if we have a customer that has a building, let's say it's a McDonald Donalds, can you talk about the multiple services for one station.",77,,
694,0.97,4691.119,4692.788,"And thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",78,,
695,0.97,4692.788,4700.829,"I think that's a nice Segue to the next slide and the next item on the agenda, item three, which is a draft Council bill right now.",78,,
696,0.97,4700.829,4703.899,And they're ready to go with that slide.,78,,
697,0.97,4703.899,4710.839,"Is it okay if we dive into that Oh, Councilmember Herbold, before we get into this next piece of legislation?",78,,
698,0.97,4710.839,4722.184,I did want to ask a specific question around the priorities.,79,,
699,0.97,4722.184,4735.53,I didn't see working with our solid waste contractors through Spu to continue the conversion of garbage and recycling fleets to electric vehicles.,79,,
700,0.97,4735.53,4744.306,Just wondering whether or not that is an element in 2 plans since that is a really important initiative that Spu has begun.,79,,
701,0.97,4744.306,4752.147,And we want to see more of those electric trucks.,79,,
702,0.97,4752.147,4757.519,"That support is going be ongoing, and it'll be considered under, I would say, the fleet category.",80,,
703,0.97,4757.519,4772.134,And I think we maybe just failed to call it out on this particular Intoto graphic.,80,,
704,0.97,4772.134,4778.507,"This deals with the resolution and ordinance that go together, as Eric mentioned.",81,,
705,0.97,4778.507,4785.046,And Seattle city light is putting the finishing touches on another Council bill that will go directly to the full Council on October 5.,81,,
706,0.97,4785.046,4787.649,And it's all part of this package.,81,,
707,0.97,4787.649,4791.853,And so this slide here speaks to that.,81,,
708,0.97,4791.853,4798.827,"So general manager Smith, did you want to speak to this single site, single service issue?",81,,
709,0.97,4798.827,4803.598,"Well, I'm going to actually let Emeka do that because this has been--this was a thing for me.",82,,
710,0.97,4803.598,4814.743,"I think it came up in the comments, I and know it's something that--I think it even came up in a question from the Councilmembers.",82,,
711,0.97,4814.743,4821.016,"We as a city, we had a goal that was set in 2017 about the number of publicly owned charging stations.",82,,
712,0.97,4821.016,4834.996,"And this is actually a great example of even in this we're looking at a four-year window, and the technology that is will be available to us in years three and four are things I proposed that we can't think of them today.",82,,
713,0.97,4834.996,4847.409,"So we can, you know, we can develop a framework that extend into the future, but the Technologies are changing and developing and evolving so rapidly that part of it is the need to be very agile.",82,,
714,0.97,4847.409,4850.545,"So in the charging infrastructure space, that's also true.",82,,
715,0.97,4850.545,4857.752,There was a time for us where we really needed to be the one putting in charging infrastructure.,82,,
716,0.97,4857.752,4865.627,"Since then, the private sector has a very strong interest in investing in our community and investing in infrastructure.",82,,
717,0.97,4865.627,4866.161,That's good for Seattle.,82,,
718,0.97,4866.161,4874.469,"And that happens both in terms of charging infrastructure, I think as you heard last week, it's due in terms of 5G roll out.",82,,
719,0.97,4874.469,4881.009,One of our goals as a city is to make it more--make it easier and make it possible to receive those dollars.,82,,
720,0.97,4881.009,4888.95,"You know, one of the big issues or one of the big opportunities for the city has been Volkswagen dollars.",82,,
721,0.97,4888.95,4891.886,That's where I got my--wrapped my head around this.,82,,
722,0.97,4891.886,4892.988,And we were struggling.,82,,
723,0.97,4892.988,4896.958,"I asked Emeka, quite honestly, and he had moved on from his job.",82,,
724,0.97,4896.958,4900.028,He had done a stint as the engineering officer.,82,,
725,0.97,4900.028,4901.596,He moved on into this new space.,82,,
726,0.97,4901.596,4908.837,"And I said, can you get rid of this hurdle that everyone is having to jump over and that I have to have meetings about?",82,,
727,0.97,4908.837,4916.912,"And it was a lot harder than we thought, but I think it is--it's a housekeeping issue, but it's super important to us.",82,,
728,0.97,4916.912,4924.252,"So I'm going to let Emeka talk about it, because we couldn't be here without him.",82,,
729,0.97,4924.252,4929.791,"Well, thank you, Debra, I appreciate very gracious words.",83,,
730,0.97,4929.791,4937.699,I think I can't Overemphasize how much of a team effort this was with our engineering folks and operations folks and others to kind of put this together.,83,,
731,0.97,4937.699,4943.672,I'll be really quick with this and it gets to Councilmember Strauss' question as well.,83,,
732,0.97,4943.672,4954.849,"The single site, single service provision is a provision of our--of the municipal code that sort of initially was put in place.",83,,
733,0.97,4954.849,4965.827,It was intended to provide for safety for our crews and for the public and first responders by avoiding multiple sources of energy basically to a single site.,83,,
734,0.97,4965.827,4975.136,"Now, it's sort of over the years taken on a character where it's sort of developed this cloak Yal name, one site, one service.",83,,
735,0.97,4975.136,4985.146,"And it becomes a barrier and, frankly, a brick wall at times for some of our developers.",83,,
736,0.97,4985.146,4994.322,"One is private electric vehicle charging developers, where they are unable to access the energy they need from the grid because of their location on a site that already has power.",83,,
737,0.97,4994.322,5008.336,"And the reality is, of course, there are ways for us to provide for that without sort of creating any safety issues or for the public or for fist responders.",83,,
738,0.97,5008.336,5029.691,What we've done is sort of proposed this amendment to this municipal code language that sort of clarifies that city light has the discretion using good engineering and technical judgement to find ways to service our customers with more than one source on a site when necessary.,83,,
739,0.97,5029.691,5040.101,"So you know, to us this is really sort of a first step, but this is the kind of sort of nuts and bolts stuff we're going have to do in lots of places to enable this new future.",83,,
740,0.97,5040.101,5067.128,"I think, you know, the point that Councilmember Strauss was making earlier about just sort of the Dynamicness of how we ensure that we are meeting these needs when they come and that we are being multiple, really, with our solutions and not--trying to be efficient and try to optimize value by finding multiple uses and really thinking about the architecture of the grid in different ways.",83,,
741,0.97,5067.128,5072.367,Really is what serves to get us where we're trying to go with Electrification.,83,,
742,0.97,5072.367,5079.908,It really isn't about sort of building out traditional fixed assets like we've done historically but really thinking about that architecture differently.,83,,
743,0.97,5079.908,5087.315,And so we think this is a really good step.,83,,
744,0.97,5087.315,5091.119,It's certainly been well received by the providers we work with.,83,,
745,0.97,5091.119,5100.762,"We work with Eb go and Electrify America, which is the execution arm of the VW settlement that Debra mentioned.",83,,
746,0.97,5100.762,5106.134,And had really good responses so far to what we're proposing to you.,83,,
747,0.97,5106.134,5107.569,Councilmember Herbold?,84,,
748,0.97,5107.569,5108.77,Thank you.,85,,
749,0.97,5108.77,5128.69,"I just want to, if anybody is listening from the Puget ridge Co-Housing group in West Seattle, specifically Stu, this was an issue that they raised with me last year.",85,,
750,0.97,5128.69,5130.125,It's a Co-Housing site.,85,,
751,0.97,5130.125,5133.761,"There's probably about 25, 30 different households living there.",85,,
752,0.97,5133.761,5137.765,They're trying to get a charging station.,85,,
753,0.97,5137.765,5147.942,"And it was considered one site even though it was home to a couple dozen, more than that, households.",85,,
754,0.97,5147.942,5151.846,And so Seattle city light was super helpful.,85,,
755,0.97,5151.846,5179.173,"They helped them pursue a variance to the one site, one service policy, but what I really appreciate there, their efforts kind of pushing this issue forward and helping to make it really obvious that we need to go sort of beyond a Pathway for variance to the policy but we needed to take another look at the policy itself.",85,,
756,0.97,5179.173,5180.742,"Thank you, Councilmember.",86,,
757,0.97,5180.742,5185.747,"And again, I'll just reiterate, this definitely has been near and dear to me in terms of doing this work.",86,,
758,0.97,5185.747,5192.287,And I'll point out that this is actually part of a two pronged approach.,86,,
759,0.97,5192.287,5204.198,"The other thing we've done is altered our requirements for electric service connection, which is sort of a standards document we have on our Website for developers to incorporate this as of June of this year.",86,,
760,0.97,5204.198,5215.71,"So we've taken the first step on our side, sort of our procedural side, and then this municipal code sort of update is the second step of that.",86,,
761,0.97,5215.71,5241.436,"And Electrification aside, although it's, I think, a very important driving principle for this new policy, I'm wondering--I understand the one site, one service issue was a barrier not to just establishing Electrification stations but also in the permitting of detached accessory dwelling units.",87,,
762,0.97,5241.436,5244.606,Will this change also help with that issue as well?,87,,
763,0.97,5244.606,5248.042,"Yeah, we expect it to be helpful with that issue.",88,,
764,0.97,5248.042,5252.68,We expect it to be helpful even with some of the 5G installations.,88,,
765,0.97,5252.68,5266.928,"There are lots of places where this helps because it acknowledges a much more dynamic grid architecture than, you know, that exists today as compared to historically.",88,,
766,0.97,5266.928,5268.963,Thank you.,89,,
767,0.97,5268.963,5270.932,"Thank you, Councilmember.",90,,

769,0.97,5283.978,5301.095,"And then the enabling ordinance, council bill 119895, knowing that this--the last piece that we just discussed will be coming directly to Council on October 5, but we're going to vote on the resolution, the ordinance, the first ordinance right now.",90,,
770,0.97,5301.095,5308.036,Any questions for Seattle city light before we make motions?,90,,
771,0.97,5308.036,5308.536,Councilmember Herbold?,90,,
772,0.97,5308.536,5308.87,Thank you.,91,,
773,0.97,5308.87,5327.789,I'm just interested to know what city light's response is to much of the public testimony that we heard at the beginning of the meeting related to the need for more benchmarks and Timelines in the plan.,91,,
774,0.97,5327.789,5334.062,Just wondering what your thoughts are about that request from the public.,91,,
775,0.97,5334.062,5340.435,"So I'll maybe take a stab at that first, and if Debra or David want to jump in, they can.",92,,
776,0.97,5340.435,5346.074,"But I will just say, we recognize and acknowledge, certainly, those concerns.",92,,
777,0.97,5346.074,5352.146,"It's important really to point out that this--what we've brought forward today is the first step in that work, right?",92,,
778,0.97,5352.146,5360.955,"In order to get to the kind of ambitious and aggressive goals that the Commenters have talked about, we have to start.",92,,
779,0.97,5360.955,5362.256,And this is that start.,92,,
780,0.97,5362.256,5370.732,"We think, certainly, as we've talked about, moving into the second phase of our community engagement, we'll lead pretty rapidly.",92,,
781,0.97,5370.732,5391.452,We are prepared and geared up to start that outreach pretty much as soon as this is approved and so later this year and into early next year we expect to begin talking about the specific program offerings and ideas that we have in collaboration with our communities to begin developing an implementation plan.,92,,
782,0.97,5391.452,5393.654,So we want to get started here.,92,,
783,0.97,5393.654,5403.197,"That's what this is about, but we certainly--we're right with them on the urgency to meet the climate change crisis.",92,,
784,0.97,5403.197,5417.011,So are you committing to us today that the next phase of the project will include that more level of detail on benchmarks and goals?,93,,
785,0.97,5417.011,5421.449,That's going to be developed in this next stage?,93,,
786,0.97,5421.449,5421.783,Absolutely.,94,,
787,0.97,5421.783,5425.953,"I'm certainly--and I see my boss nodding with me in the background, right?",94,,
788,0.97,5425.953,5430.792,I think we are all in lock step about that's absolutely what we expect to follow.,94,,
789,0.97,5430.792,5434.162,"And again, pretty rapidly, we've geared up to start right away.",94,,
790,0.97,5434.162,5435.062,Thank you.,95,,
791,0.97,5435.062,5437.465,Thank you Councilmember Herbold for asking that question.,96,,
792,0.97,5437.465,5438.499,I had the same question.,96,,
793,0.97,5438.499,5452.847,"And I want to thank those speakers for taking the time to review the plan and call us and to be constantly pushing even though, you know, we are--Seattle city light is the best and ahead of so many things.",96,,
794,0.97,5452.847,5456.05,And we also want to keep pushing.,96,,
795,0.97,5456.05,5461.456,"So thanks for those callers, and thanks.",96,,

853,0.97,5696.323,5696.624,Thank you.,126,,
854,0.97,5696.624,5696.857,Okay.,127,,
855,0.97,5696.857,5699.727,"General manager Smith, please take it away.",127,,
856,0.97,5699.727,5701.128,"Great, thank you.",128,,
857,0.97,5701.128,5702.563,This is a technical item.,128,,
858,0.97,5702.563,5712.306,"It's actually very interesting, and I think you're going to find a bit of education about the transmission assets the city owns.",128,,
859,0.97,5712.306,5721.449,"Just a connection back, so we talk about the grid and, certainly, for Seattle much of the grid that we think about is our distribution grid.",128,,
860,0.97,5721.449,5733.861,"It's the way we are serving businesses, homes, industrial customers, and that is generally distribution level voltage, Conduit that meets those needs.",128,,
861,0.97,5733.861,5735.396,That's not always the case.,128,,
862,0.97,5735.396,5741.936,We have very large customers where they are served at a higher voltage and that's normal.,128,,
863,0.97,5741.936,5750.711,"And we also own transmission, particularly from our Skagit project, that's the focus of this discussion.",128,,
864,0.97,5750.711,5754.148,I have to say one thing because I'm surprised that Emeka didn't say it.,128,,
865,0.97,5754.148,5759.42,"A long time ago, I am not an engineer, so I tend to think about things in a Nontechnical way.",128,,
866,0.97,5759.42,5769.93,"Usually when he does a talk he talks about the phone, because I made the analogy that our Smartphones are the grid.",128,,
867,0.97,5769.93,5774.268,They are the foundation that allows us to do all kinds of cool things in our lives.,128,,
868,0.97,5774.268,5785.513,"And I know that, like me, I'm sure all of you have contemplated what life would be like right now if we did not have smart devices and/or access to the Internet.",128,,
869,0.97,5785.513,5800.127,"So what our responsibility is as a utility company is to provide infrastructure that allows others to, you know, if you will, create Apps that ride on that infrastructure and contribute to the quality of life.",128,,
870,0.97,5800.127,5816.477,"Certainly when you talk about and probably some of you have attended meetings or conferences that talk about smart cities, and smart city applications all rely on the grid, typically, as the way of fuelling and moving a smart city forward.",128,,
871,0.97,5816.477,5827.021,"So this, again, is a pricing discussion because when a city has excess capacity in city-owned infrastructure, it makes sense to get the most value from that infrastructure.",128,,
872,0.97,5827.021,5830.524,So we do do that with respect to our transmission.,128,,
873,0.97,5830.524,5838.899,And this is the--this presentation is going to talk about how we charge customers other than ourselves who might ride on that portion of the grid.,128,,
874,0.97,5838.899,5843.737,"So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Jim Baggs for just a moment to introduce.",128,,
875,0.97,5843.737,5845.272,And I think most of you know Jim.,128,,
876,0.97,5845.272,5850.077,And he's been with the city quite a while and has served in different roles.,128,,
877,0.97,5850.077,5855.082,This is really the area where Jim is--has extreme expertise.,128,,
878,0.97,5855.082,5860.154,"And so it's way too Geeky for me, Jim?",128,,
879,0.97,5860.154,5862.856,"For the Geeky part, thank you, Debra.",129,,
880,0.97,5862.856,5870.364,And I'll just say a couple words and then introduce Melissa Skelton who's going to do the bulk of this presentation.,129,,
881,0.97,5870.364,5886.914,"But a little bit piling on to what Debra said and Emeka said earlier, I couldn't help but think throughout this whole grid is a platform conversation that we've had going on here is that is so true on a local level and around Seattle and everything that was said leading up to this point too.",129,,
882,0.97,5886.914,5910.304,"But one of the things that's lost on most of the public, and it is kind of a Geeky sort of thing, is that the Western United States and part of Canada and northern Mexico is all one big electric machine, and it's all interconnected physically, and there are commercial transactions as well.",129,,
883,0.97,5910.304,5926.387,"So even though no one really SEES it very much, every hour of every day our customers and the citizens of Seattle are benefiting from this interconnectedness that we have with the rest of the West.",129,,
884,0.97,5926.387,5934.929,And this transmission open access tariff is just one piece of the way in which we manage those relationships throughout the West.,129,,
885,0.97,5934.929,5940.367,"And as Debra said, some of the commercial practices with other customers.",129,,
886,0.97,5940.367,5945.906,So it's important even though it's not necessarily terribly visible on a day-to-day basis.,129,,
887,0.97,5945.906,5953.213,"So with that, I will introduce Melissa Skelton from our regulatory affairs area and is going to run through this presentation.",129,,
888,0.97,5953.213,5954.315,Thank you.,129,,
889,0.97,5954.315,5957.251,"Great, thank you, Jim.",130,,
890,0.97,5957.251,5963.324,"Good morning, chairman Pedersen, vice chair Strauss, Councilmembers Gonzalez, Herbold and Morales.",130,,
891,0.97,5963.324,5968.362,My name is Melissa Skelton and Jim noted I work in the regulatory affairs office.,130,,
892,0.97,5968.362,5971.799,"Joining me today is Cathy Leone woods, a director of regulatory affairs.",130,,
893,0.97,5971.799,5979.139,And we are pleaded to be here today to present our update to our open transmission tariff or oat.,130,,
894,0.97,5979.139,5987.715,I will be the one providing the presentation and Cathy and I are both available if you have questions.,130,,
895,0.97,5987.715,5992.386,I'll introduce you to what an oat is to set the stage for understanding the legislation.,130,,
896,0.97,5992.386,6002.863,"Which is, like noted a technical bill updating what was approved by the Council back in 2009.",130,,
897,0.97,6002.863,6009.503,"Then I will provide you a history of the oat, updated to reflect industry rate and the business needs of city light.",130,,
898,0.97,6009.503,6017.778,"Then I will high like the key policy affirmations and provisions to this 2020 oat update, including wholesale transmission rates.",130,,
899,0.97,6017.778,6026.887,And I will conclude with a few comments about the internal oat implementation at City light.,130,,
900,0.97,6026.887,6027.988,"Next slide, please, Maura.",130,,
901,0.97,6027.988,6028.389,"Great, thank you.",130,,
902,0.97,6028.389,6038.432,"So for those of you who don't spend the days and nights in the depths of transmission tariffs like I do and Cathy does, a little bit about what it is.",130,,
903,0.97,6038.432,6046.74,So an open access transmission tariff governs how others can transmit electricity between points on our transmission system and lines.,130,,
904,0.97,6046.74,6053.38,So oats were created to enable choice of generation and utility providers and to ensure that transmission was not a barrier to that.,130,,
905,0.97,6053.38,6065.259,So the oat is the suite of uniform template or pro forma for legal Beagles across the utility industry.,130,,
906,0.97,6065.259,6074.935,"They require transmission owners to provide open, comparable and nondiscriminatory access on systems to wholesale transmission customers for the interconnection of generation.",130,,
907,0.97,6074.935,6078.939,The oat defines the terms and conditions of that transmission service.,130,,
908,0.97,6078.939,6088.515,"And as noted earlier, transmission for our purposes here generally means lines that are rated 115 KV and above for the longer distance transmission of electricity.",130,,
909,0.97,6088.515,6101.929,"So for city light, that means, as Debra noted, our transmission lines, for example, leading up to our Hydro projects, like at Skagit, and also East side lines.",130,,
910,0.97,6101.929,6124.251,"So for your awareness, eligible customers who could take wholesale transmission service under this tariff are other electric you Tills such as Puget sound energy or Snohomish Pud and Federal power or marketing agencies, any entity creating energy for sale or retail.",130,,
911,0.97,6124.251,6124.952,"Next slide, please, Maura.",130,,
912,0.97,6124.952,6125.252,Okay great.,130,,
913,0.97,6125.252,6132.793,Brief background of city light's oat and how we got to how where we are today.,130,,
914,0.97,6132.793,6141.635,"In 2000, the regulatory Commission opened inquiries examining the Federal power act, specifically the open access transmission service.",130,,
915,0.97,6141.635,6149.476,So the Federal regulator responsible for ensuring the reliability of Interstate transmission of electricity.,130,,
916,0.97,6149.476,6158.752,They examined transmission tariffs to ensure there was not undo discrimination or preference in services and that the services and rates were just and reasonable.,130,,
917,0.97,6158.752,6163.924,So this and other efforts at that time stem from issues surrounding the energy crisis.,130,,
918,0.97,6163.924,6185.012,"So at that time, city light and other public power utilities like us came to an agreement that we would administer an oat like the pro forma that required a rate regulated investor owned utilities like Puget.",130,,
919,0.97,6185.012,6190.117,So we established our first oat in 2009 with Council's approval.,130,,
920,0.97,6190.117,6197.224,"Over the last ten years since they've first established its formal oat, there have been several updates to their provisions.",130,,
921,0.97,6197.224,6216.777,"Over the last five years since 2015, city light has been reviewing those updates to the pro forma, led by regulatory affairs, but also with input across the organization from engineering, finance, power management, system operations, risk management, legal and others.",130,,
922,0.97,6216.777,6220.847,"In this comprehensive examination, we also hired two consultants.",130,,
923,0.97,6220.847,6233.627,One legal review with a public power emphasis and one rates review with a deep history in establishing oat's methodology and rates.,130,,
924,0.97,6233.627,6245.005,"Other public power utilities, regional utilities and utilities who have joined the energy and balance market in California for E Im specific provisions to ensure we were updating as appropriate for city light.",130,,
925,0.97,6245.005,6250.377,I will speak to Eim here shortly.,130,,
926,0.97,6250.377,6250.978,"Next slide, please, Maura.",130,,
927,0.97,6250.978,6251.211,Okay so.,130,,
928,0.97,6251.211,6256.516,Now I will run you through the key policy affirmations and provisions of this 2020 oat update.,130,,
929,0.97,6256.516,6261.388,"So of course, we're here because we own transmission lines and facilities in Washington state.",130,,
930,0.97,6261.388,6273.4,One of the key policy decisions made internally in city light was to transition legacy contracts that we had that contained transmission elements to this updated oat.,130,,
931,0.97,6273.4,6289.116,"In the past, city light negotiated bundled agreements with other utilities such as Puget and Snohomish which included generation, transmission and interconnection components.",130,,
932,0.97,6289.116,6291.818,Now we're Unbundling those agreements.,130,,
933,0.97,6291.818,6295.722,We are still committing to provide nondiscriminatory service.,130,,
934,0.97,6295.722,6311.004,"And as I noted previously, these 2020 oat updates are modelled after the standardized template for utilities, except for small modifications to fit our municipal business needs.",130,,
935,0.97,6311.004,6311.838,"Next slide, please.",130,,
936,0.97,6311.838,6319.846,So some of our modifications to those pro forma terms and conditions account for our status as a municipal utility.,130,,
937,0.97,6319.846,6325.118,We don't have the same operational considerations as an investor-owned utility.,130,,
938,0.97,6325.118,6327.087,"Lots the same, but some differences.",130,,
939,0.97,6327.087,6339.633,"This allows for point to point transmission service, the transmission of capacity and energy from the point of receipt on our system to the point of delivery, to where the power's going, on a firm or Nonfirm basis.",130,,
940,0.97,6339.633,6352.612,"Also, I noted earlier, we joined California's independent system operator energy and balance market or Eim.",130,,
941,0.97,6352.612,6354.481,We joined in April 2020.,130,,
942,0.97,6354.481,6357.551,It's a Realtime market that allows participants to engage in supply and demand.,130,,
943,0.97,6357.551,6367.861,The mark does that by finding the lowest cost resource from across the larger region to meet Realtime needs so that results in a balanced supply and demand at the lower cost.,130,,
944,0.97,6367.861,6372.432,That's great for our customers and the region.,130,,
945,0.97,6372.432,6378.004,"In our joining Eim, we contractually committed to update our oat for Eim operations.",130,,
946,0.97,6378.004,6387.647,So one of the attachments is attachment Q which accommodates our entrance into the energy imbalance market.,130,,
947,0.97,6387.647,6397.891,"City light has joined northern grid, which is a regional transmission planning organization Consolidated from Columbia grid and the northern tier transmission group.",130,,
948,0.97,6397.891,6405.632,We continue to explore updates to our transmission planning process and the materials.,130,,
949,0.97,6405.632,6408.902,"That's attachment K, with the Formalization of planning northern grid.",130,,
950,0.97,6408.902,6417.411,Last but certainly not least is our review of our wholesale transmission methodology and rates.,130,,
951,0.97,6417.411,6418.211,"Next slide, please.",130,,
952,0.97,6418.211,6439.366,"So we hired, as I noted earlier, an expert rates consultant for oat and conducted a comprehensive review of our wholesale transmission methodology and rates to ensure we were allocating costs proportionately to transmission.",130,,
953,0.97,6439.366,6450.243,"We generally followed methodology using our 2018 financials to update our rate schedules in the legislation and updated our rates from 2008 to 2018, as I noted.",130,,
954,0.97,6450.243,6452.412,So the rates have increased from 2009.,130,,
955,0.97,6452.412,6463.79,"Of course, during the passage of time but also because of the update to the methodology as advised by our rates consultant, which includes all city like's transmission line in our calculations.",130,,
956,0.97,6463.79,6473.733,We want to make clear here we expect a neutral fiscal impact as the oat rates methodology requires Cost-Based transmission service.,130,,
957,0.97,6473.733,6481.174,"So it's not a Moneymaker for the facility, unfortunately, because they require the rates are just and reasonable.",130,,
958,0.97,6481.174,6487.18,"So all customers pay the same amount, you know, when they take service.",130,,
959,0.97,6487.18,6487.781,"Next slide, please.",130,,
960,0.97,6487.781,6495.155,So that's the history and provisions to this oat update.,130,,
961,0.97,6495.155,6496.823,Then we move into implementation.,130,,
962,0.97,6496.823,6504.798,We begin updating internally to move those legacy agreements that I noted we have as they expire into this updated oat pro forma structure.,130,,
963,0.97,6504.798,6512.873,This will occur with some small shifts in responsibility and interactions internally in city light and through the tariff implementation.,130,,
964,0.97,6512.873,6526.086,"And of course, that includes updates to various business practices as you can see on this slide, including financial accounting, standards of conduct, implementing a transmission Website and the like.",130,,
965,0.97,6526.086,6528.154,So that's--next slide please.,130,,
966,0.97,6528.154,6530.223,That's all for my formal part of the presentation.,130,,
967,0.97,6530.223,6534.327,I'd like to see if the committee has any questions.,130,,
968,0.97,6534.327,6536.263,I'd be happy to answer any.,130,,
969,0.97,6536.263,6536.963,Cathy is also available.,130,,
970,0.97,6536.963,6539.432,I thank you for your time so far.,130,,
971,0.97,6539.432,6539.699,Thank you.,130,,
972,0.97,6539.699,6540.033,Thank you.,131,,
973,0.97,6540.033,6543.103,I see Councilmember Strauss has a question.,131,,
974,0.97,6543.103,6544.07,"Thank you, chair.",132,,
975,0.97,6544.07,6544.638,"Thank you, Melissa.",132,,
976,0.97,6544.638,6546.339,"And also, thank you Jim Baggs.",132,,
977,0.97,6546.339,6576.803,"It's great to see you being this is the first time I've seen you in Committee, I just want to call out the fact as we were waiting for Debra Smith to come on board here, Jim was the one that kept a steady hand on the till of city light and just call out the fact that when we had a billing backlog, Jim came in and helped really make--granted the staff that work with you are the ones that get that job done, but Jim, you have done work for city light.",132,,
978,0.97,6576.803,6579.673,I wanted to highlight and thank you.,132,,
979,0.97,6579.673,6592.018,"My one question about Western power grid, it's my understanding that we've got three power Grids generally in the United States, northeastern, Western and then is Texas its own grid?",132,,
980,0.97,6592.018,6594.554,I can't speak to that.,133,,
981,0.97,6594.554,6596.856,I might lean to Cathy for that.,133,,
982,0.97,6596.856,6600.527,"I haven't paid attentions to the regions, what's happening outside.",133,,
983,0.97,6600.527,6602.929,"Cathy, can you help with that?",133,,
984,0.97,6602.929,6603.797,"Yes, yes it is.",134,,
985,0.97,6603.797,6604.331,So yes --,134,,
986,0.97,6604.331,6610.704,It's a whole other country they say.,135,,
987,0.97,6610.704,6611.071,Yeah.,136,,
988,0.97,6611.071,6611.571,Excellent.,137,,
989,0.97,6611.571,6616.743,"So just really great to see, Jim, and thank you for that update.",137,,
990,0.97,6616.743,6617.41,Thank you.,138,,
991,0.97,6617.41,6629.656,"Melissa, this is a really great presentation, and I think you answered the question when you said that we have to keep our rates fair and uniform.",139,,
992,0.97,6629.656,6645.071,"Since other entities are using our power grid to move their electricity, is it at all possible for us to charge them a higher rate for moving dirty power across our lines or make them buy carbon credits?",139,,
993,0.97,6645.071,6649.376,Is there anything we can do to Disincentivize dirty electricity?,139,,
994,0.97,6649.376,6653.446,"That's a great question, thank you for asking it.",140,,
995,0.97,6653.446,6659.653,"As you stated, and I most noted in my presentation, the rates are uniform throughout.",140,,
996,0.97,6659.653,6668.528,"That does allow, also, when you're talking about the dirty power is that it provides equal access to alternative and renewable forms of power.",140,,
997,0.97,6668.528,6679.472,"So we can't change--charge any different rates for renewable power versus coal power, but we're providing equal access to the system.",140,,
998,0.97,6679.472,6679.873,Thank you.,141,,
999,0.97,6679.873,6682.709,And this is both--I'll merge both of my questions into one.,141,,
1000,0.97,6682.709,6701.928,"I think that I know the answer, but also for the energy imbalance market and the fact that we are not regulated by ERC because we are regulated by the city, again, do we get any benefits from the energy imbalance market from being publicly owned?",141,,
1001,0.97,6701.928,6711.404,And are there any benefits we receive for being publicly owned rather than investor or Profit-Owned.,141,,
1002,0.97,6711.404,6713.44,"Yes, thank you for those questions.",142,,
1003,0.97,6713.44,6716.876,We aren't treated any differently as a public power entity there.,142,,
1004,0.97,6716.876,6729.456,"I think there are 10 or 11 other entity that is joined Eim, but I am no expert.",142,,
1005,0.97,6729.456,6740.3,"As to your second question, as far as authority over city light and our open access transmission tariff, I want to make clear, we are not rate regulated by FERC.",142,,
1006,0.97,6740.3,6747.04,"We are wholly regulated at a high level, but it is up to you, city Council, as our regulator to keep us kind of in check.",142,,
1007,0.97,6747.04,6761.788,"I don't know if you had this as a question, but you know, if there were issues with the oat or we have any updates or we're not falling in line with what we should be doing, the last recourse would be someone could take us to FERC.",142,,
1008,0.97,6761.788,6771.364,"And I'll speak, personally here I don't know if Cathy has comments or Jim as well on this, if someone took us to FERC, we have failed in regulatory affairs at City light.",142,,
1009,0.97,6771.364,6776.236,So I would anticipate going forward that we will take a look at the rates internally.,142,,
1010,0.97,6776.236,6782.475,I can't guess what that is.,142,,
1011,0.97,6782.475,6787.413,We'll bring them back to you to take a look at it.,142,,
1012,0.97,6787.413,6797.423,"If we have any updates to the pro forma we will, you know, conduct those internally if there's anything significant, we'd bring it back to you for sure.",142,,
1013,0.97,6797.423,6805.298,"I might add one brief comment to--on top of what Melissa said, which is absolutely correct.",143,,
1014,0.97,6805.298,6811.104,"Going back to Commissioner Strauss' question, your question about the differentiation in rates.",143,,
1015,0.97,6811.104,6843.002,"And this is really more context than anything else, but part of the impetus of tariffs nationwide really had to do with a longtime historical perspective where--in which utilities were able to basically control the transportation network and do utility things without--and accept or deny permission for other entities to use or get, you know, use their networks to provide alternative sources of energy and the like.",143,,
1016,0.97,6843.002,6852.245,And there was a point in the '90s when FERC said enough already.,143,,
1017,0.97,6852.245,6878.438,"There are alternative types of electricity, many of which are Renewables, but other providers Besides Monopoly-Owned utilities across the country, and mandated the development of open access tariffs to essentially level the playing field so that utilities could not prohibit some of the cleaner sources of energy from being developed and brought into the grid.",143,,
1018,0.97,6878.438,6878.972,"Thank you, Jim.",144,,
1019,0.97,6878.972,6886.346,So now we are on the opposite side of that coin where we can't prohibit dirty electricity.,144,,
1020,0.97,6886.346,6890.85,That's interesting to see how things have shifted.,144,,
1021,0.97,6890.85,6892.919,And thank you.,144,,
1022,0.97,6892.919,6894.287,Those are all my questions.,144,,
1023,0.97,6894.287,6896.589,"Really great presentation, Melissa, Cathy, thank you all.",144,,
1024,0.97,6896.589,6897.323,Thank you.,145,,
1025,0.97,6897.323,6918.211,"Hey, it is worth noting, though, before you move on, that while we can't prohibit, Washington state's clean energy act which was voted in place by the last legislative session, or is it two sessions ago now?",146,,
1026,0.97,6918.211,6923.249,"I think it was '19, same as the transportation Electrification authority.",146,,
1027,0.97,6923.249,6932.191,"And over time, that is, you know--so it is true, and of course, it's a grid and you put stuff in one end and theoretically it comes out the other end.",146,,
1028,0.97,6932.191,6943.269,"But it's like one of those old Sprinklers where they used to lay on the ground with holes everywhere, so, in fact, you know, power's coming out everywhere, even along the way on that grid.",146,,
1029,0.97,6943.269,6947.273,"So you know, Washington state did a good thing.",146,,
1030,0.97,6947.273,6959.953,"And as that ramps up and as those provisions and requirements change, you know, any dirty power that might be going in would only be riding briefly on our system because it isn't going to be staying in Washington state.",146,,
1031,0.97,6959.953,6964.324,"And Ironically, this was just a quick aside, but you'll find this interesting, I think.",146,,
1032,0.97,6964.324,6976.169,"I was on a call yesterday for one of our industry trade groups, and we were talking about the legislative outlook for 2021 around power and clean energy.",146,,
1033,0.97,6976.169,6986.245,"And before '19, before 2019, I thought that--I thought Oregon would pass a cap in trade, a form of taxing carbon.",146,,
1034,0.97,6986.245,6991.117,And I thought Oregon would do that in '19 because they worked on it far couple of years.,146,,
1035,0.97,6991.117,6995.321,And then I thought Washington would have an opportunity to Piggy back.,146,,
1036,0.97,6995.321,7001.761,"And as it happened, Oregon did not get that through.",146,,
1037,0.97,7001.761,7008.101,"The Republican Electeds actually walked out to not take a vote, it was a big deal.",146,,
1038,0.97,7008.101,7009.769,And Washington passed something.,146,,
1039,0.97,7009.769,7017.243,"I think Oregon is looking seriously at going for a clean energy, like Washington.",146,,
1040,0.97,7017.243,7029.789,"As you begin to expand the distance that this interconnected grid is covering and you begin to ramp up those clean energy requirements in the West, essentially, Councilmember, you'll get there.",146,,
1041,0.97,7029.789,7036.462,"You'll get there over time, but you will get there.",146,,
1042,0.97,7036.462,7041.634,"Thank you, general manager Smith, and thanks for those questions, Councilmember Strauss.",147,,
1043,0.97,7041.634,7048.241,Any other questions on this item for Council bill 119899?,147,,
1044,0.97,7048.241,7058.184,"Okay, committee members, I'd like to move now that the committee recommend passage of Council bill 119899.",147,,
1045,0.97,7058.184,7060.62,Is there a second?,147,,
1046,0.97,7060.62,7060.92,Second.,148,,
1047,0.97,7060.92,7061.621,Second.,149,,

1050,0.97,7066.993,7068.294,Any final comments?,150,,
1051,0.97,7068.294,7068.561,All right.,150,,
1052,0.97,7068.561,7078.337,Will the clerk please call the roll on the committee recommendation that this bill pass?,150,,
1053,0.97,7078.337,7079.305,Gonzalez?,151,,

1064,0.97,7090.016,7096.689,Motion carries and the committee recommendation that the bill pass will be sent to the October 5 city council meeting.,162,,
1065,0.97,7096.689,7110.803,"Now, committee members, the final item on our agenda, council bill 119898, will the clerk please read this item five into the record?",162,,
1066,0.97,7110.803,7134.494,"Council bill 1119898, an ordinance relating to the city light Department, amending subsection 21.49.086.D of the Seattle municipal code to define the net wholesale revenue target used in rate stabilization account operations for 2021 through 2024, for briefing, discussion and possible vote.",163,,
1067,0.97,7134.494,7135.261,Thank you.,164,,
1068,0.97,7135.261,7140.733,"And to our city council central staff, Eric, any introductory comments?",164,,
1069,0.97,7140.733,7148.14,Not much to say other than the--what you'll hear today will have--it does have direct affect on customer bills.,165,,
1070,0.97,7148.14,7152.912,There's a small surcharge that goes into bills that will be explained.,165,,
1071,0.97,7152.912,7158.117,And so this--this is something that customers will be interested in.,165,,
1072,0.97,7158.117,7162.555,It is important and there's a possibility of good news at the top of next year.,165,,
1073,0.97,7162.555,7164.891,And I'm scooping Kirsty a little bit.,165,,
1074,0.97,7164.891,7167.693,I should let her explain that.,165,,
1075,0.97,7167.693,7169.996,"Thank you, Eric.",166,,
1076,0.97,7169.996,7173.533,"General manager, Smith, please?",166,,

1080,0.97,7176.369,7183.376,"I mentioned I have a conflict at 11:30 a.m., I expected we would be done by now.",169,,
1081,0.97,7183.376,7186.312,I apologize for that scheduling Snafu on my end.,169,,
1082,0.97,7186.312,7194.82,Just wanted to say thanks to Seattle city light for well done work during today's committee meeting and I'm sorry I won't be here for your last presentation.,169,,
1083,0.97,7194.82,7209.068,"It's not for lack of interest, but Unfortunately, I just have a different commitment that starts right now at 11:30, so I wanted to make sure that the clerk and the chair were aware that I'm now going to, unfortunately, have to excuse myself from the meeting.",169,,
1084,0.97,7209.068,7217.81,But I appreciate the opportunity to have been able to listen in and vote in favor of the previous legislation.,169,,
1085,0.97,7217.81,7218.11,Thank you.,169,,
1086,0.97,7218.11,7219.545,"Thank you, Council President.",170,,
1087,0.97,7219.545,7223.749,"General manager Smith, go ahead and introduce this item for us.",170,,
1088,0.97,7223.749,7229.021,"Yeah, and this, again, it's an important piece.",171,,
1089,0.97,7229.021,7235.127,It does directly impact rates.,171,,
1090,0.97,7235.127,7238.097,"To reiterate, as a Publicly-Owned utility, you are our rate setting body.",171,,
1091,0.97,7238.097,7241.167,We appreciate the opportunity to talk with you and get this locked in.,171,,
1092,0.97,7241.167,7249.208,"Before I finish, because I know we're going to be ending and we are running a bit late, I was Remiss this morning in not introducing Craig Smith.",171,,
1093,0.97,7249.208,7251.711,So I think many of you know Craig Smith.,171,,
1094,0.97,7251.711,7262.855,"He was not an official presenter because, as we have stood up our new innovation and Electrification group under David Logsdon that work as moved away from Craig.",171,,
1095,0.97,7262.855,7269.328,But I did want to share with you that Craig continues to work very closely with Emeka and his team.,171,,
1096,0.97,7269.328,7274.3,And Craig has actually just accepted an opportunity to be our chief customer officer.,171,,
1097,0.97,7274.3,7282.675,"So Craig has a huge body of work in front of him, less work around Electrification, but all the item that is you saw today, they started under Craig's watch.",171,,
1098,0.97,7282.675,7286.946,"And I just want to make sure he gets the credit for that, because he brought us a long way.",171,,
1099,0.97,7286.946,7295.321,"With that I'm going to turn it over to our chief financial officer, Kirsty Grainger, and her team.",171,,
1100,0.97,7295.321,7298.224,"Great, thank you.",172,,
1101,0.97,7298.224,7303.796,"So this is a short ordinance, and I hope a quick, Four-Slide presentation for this topic.",172,,
1102,0.97,7303.796,7308.401,"Maura, if you could move to the next.",172,,
1103,0.97,7308.401,7309.001,There we go.,172,,
1104,0.97,7309.001,7317.376,"So this ordinance pertains to net wholesale revenue, which is the revenue that city light gets from the sales of surplus electricity.",172,,
1105,0.97,7317.376,7327.553,"As you may know, our clean, low cost, primarily hydroelectric resources, generate more power than we need to serve our customer owners.",172,,
1106,0.97,7327.553,7329.255,And this is a good thing.,172,,
1107,0.97,7329.255,7341.967,"It protects us from market risk, and then we sell the surplus power to other utilities and this supplements our revenues, which helps keep rates low, which is good.",172,,
1108,0.97,7341.967,7348.341,One challenge around these revenues is that they are notoriously hard to forecast and budget for.,172,,
1109,0.97,7348.341,7352.178,"There's a lot of internal, I mean external forces.",172,,
1110,0.97,7352.178,7366.859,"There's uncertainty on the supply and the demand side, Hydro runoff, weather retail demand, plus the market value of the surplus electricity is hard to predict.",172,,
1111,0.97,7366.859,7370.563,"Move on to the next slide, Maura.",172,,
1112,0.97,7370.563,7370.83,Thank you.,172,,
1113,0.97,7370.83,7379.605,"So enter the rate stabilization account, which was established actually in the aftermath of the last recession in 2011.",172,,
1114,0.97,7379.605,7388.748,The Rsa is a mechanism for limiting the impact of these external factors on city light's revenues and our rates.,172,,
1115,0.97,7388.748,7391.25,And the slide has a lot of numbers.,172,,
1116,0.97,7391.25,7403.229,"I'm not going to dig in too much, but the Rsa is a cash Reserve and a set of accounting rules that are established by ordinance in municipal code.",172,,
1117,0.97,7403.229,7404.697,And they buffer the revenues.,172,,
1118,0.97,7404.697,7410.936,The way it works is we target or budget lower case budgets and a certain amount of revenues.,172,,
1119,0.97,7410.936,7427.953,"And then if the revenues that we realize are higher, we deposit the extra into the Rsa and Conversely, if the revenues come any lower, then we withdraw and supplement from the Rsa.",172,,
1120,0.97,7427.953,7435.861,"And if this Rsa Reserve gets depleted, at certain levels, automatic rate surcharges come on to fill it.",172,,
1121,0.97,7435.861,7443.102,"We do have a small surcharge in place right now, 3%, and we'll talk a little bit more about that and rates later in the presentation.",172,,
1122,0.97,7443.102,7450.276,"So again, the purpose of this Ordnance is to establish this baseline or target or budget.",172,,
1123,0.97,7450.276,7461.954,We use those terms sort of Interchangeably for 2021 and future years because that is required by municipal code.,172,,
1124,0.97,7461.954,7462.555,"Next slide, Maura.",172,,
1125,0.97,7462.555,7462.755,Great.,172,,
1126,0.97,7462.755,7462.955,Okay.,172,,
1127,0.97,7462.955,7476.836,"So you can see here in the green table what the ordinance does is establish that baseline of $60 million for 2021 and then $40 million for the years 2022, '23 and '24.",172,,
1128,0.97,7476.836,7480.973,And normally this Ordnance would be part of a larger legislative package.,172,,
1129,0.97,7480.973,7483.976,It would follow in the wake of our strategic plan.,172,,
1130,0.97,7483.976,7490.983,It would be accompanied by a rate Ordnance and then all of that would feed into the budget process.,172,,
1131,0.97,7490.983,7494.286,But 2020 is not a normal year.,172,,
1132,0.97,7494.286,7495.387,Our strategic plan is paused.,172,,
1133,0.97,7495.387,7500.593,We are--we don't have a rate action proposed for 2021.,172,,
1134,0.97,7500.593,7510.002,And so this ordinance is the only budget prelude item that city light has this year.,172,,
1135,0.97,7510.002,7521.413,"And you'll NOTE 2021, the $60 million that we have there, obviously, that's higher than we have had in 2020 or in some previous years.",172,,
1136,0.97,7521.413,7528.254,"But it is supported by fundamentals, Imper Cal factor.",172,,
1137,0.97,7528.254,7532.057,"We are seeing lower consumption from customers, particularly on the commercial and industrial side.",172,,
1138,0.97,7532.057,7536.595,And we anticipate that this will continue along with the recession into 2021.,172,,
1139,0.97,7536.595,7547.873,"And so this will reduce our retail sales, but we will take that energy and sell it on the wholesale market and recapture some of the revenue that we will have lost.",172,,
1140,0.97,7547.873,7558.117,So it's important to recognize that that interplay as we go into setting our budgets.,172,,
1141,0.97,7558.117,7561.921,"And Furthermore, the market prices are strong in 2021.",172,,
1142,0.97,7561.921,7565.324,And we are seeing revenue from participation in the Weim.,172,,
1143,0.97,7565.324,7573.432,All of these factors together are making for what we hope will be a strong year for wholesale revenue in 2021.,172,,
1144,0.97,7573.432,7578.37,"Our forecast is $74 million, which is even higher than when we were drafting this ordinance.",172,,
1145,0.97,7578.37,7584.376,"So with all that in mind, that $60 million we feel is a pretty prudent target for next year.",172,,
1146,0.97,7584.376,7592.518,"And then for the out years, 2022 through 2024, that's a place holder value.",172,,
1147,0.97,7592.518,7596.789,We anticipate this could be updated in future budget rate cycles as needed.,172,,
1148,0.97,7596.789,7601.06,So that's what the ordinance is all about.,172,,
1149,0.97,7601.06,7610.769,"My last slide, thanks, Maura, perfect, is just a quick discussion about rates because the Rsa does impact rates as it is a rate mechanism.",172,,
1150,0.97,7610.769,7616.842,"So the Rsa surcharge right now is at 3%, and it increased back in November of 2019.",172,,
1151,0.97,7616.842,7627.252,Although customers wouldn't have seen this impact on their bills because there was another rate change that happened concurrently where we decreased due to the Bpa pass through.,172,,
1152,0.97,7627.252,7632.091,And so what actually happened in rates was a tiny rate decrease.,172,,
1153,0.97,7632.091,7637.262,We had a general increase that averaged 4.7% at the beginning of this year.,172,,
1154,0.97,7637.262,7645.671,"And then looking forward, as I mentioned, we don't anticipate having a rate increase for 2021 pending budget proceedings.",172,,
1155,0.97,7645.671,7650.275,So we'll be talking more about that in the coming months.,172,,
1156,0.97,7650.275,7671.964,"And then the good news, as Eric alluded, is that we anticipate that given the Rsa Baselines, the net wholesale revenue targets proposed in this ordinance, presuming that we have an okay snow pack and a good runoff and our forecasts materialize, those revenues come through.",172,,
1157,0.97,7671.964,7676.068,The Rsa surcharge should decrease and then be lifted in 2021.,172,,
1158,0.97,7676.068,7683.509,And so that will be some very welcome rate relief for customer owners.,172,,
1159,0.97,7683.509,7686.645,And that's all I have.,172,,
1160,0.97,7686.645,7687.88,What questions can we --,172,,
1161,0.97,7687.88,7688.614,Thank you.,173,,
1162,0.97,7688.614,7692.084,Your very last statement was the one that was most important for me.,173,,
1163,0.97,7692.084,7706.131,"One of my number one priorities chairing the committee that has both utility enterprises is to keep rates low, especially for our residential customers.",173,,
1164,0.97,7706.131,7712.671,And so you're explaining these assumptions and how these components impact the ultimate net rate that goes to the customer.,173,,
1165,0.97,7712.671,7721.713,"What I heard you saying is that the rates will not go up and, in fact, will initially go down is your prediction?",173,,
1166,0.97,7721.713,7722.114,That's right.,174,,
1167,0.97,7722.114,7727.152,We don't have any plans to increase rates for 2021.,174,,
1168,0.97,7727.152,7730.689,And hopefully the rates will go down.,174,,
1169,0.97,7730.689,7736.695,"Again, the whole intent of the Rsa is to balance this very uncertain revenue component.",174,,
1170,0.97,7736.695,7740.699,And so there is some uncertainty as to what will happen.,174,,
1171,0.97,7740.699,7749.942,But we feel pretty good that we will be able--that these rate decreases will come through and that rate surcharge will be lifted next year.,174,,
1172,0.97,7749.942,7752.678,Thank you.,175,,
1173,0.97,7752.678,7753.145,Councilmember Herbold?,175,,
1174,0.97,7753.145,7753.479,Thank you.,176,,
1175,0.97,7753.479,7754.446,A couple questions.,176,,
1176,0.97,7754.446,7765.324,"The--can you clarify are the automatic rate surcharges that Refill the Rsa, those are surcharges on residential customers?",176,,
1177,0.97,7765.324,7771.396,But they're triggered by a loss of revenue on the wholesale side?,176,,
1178,0.97,7771.396,7771.797,All customers.,177,,
1179,0.97,7771.797,7772.131,Okay.,178,,
1180,0.97,7772.131,7772.364,Yes.,179,,
1181,0.97,7772.364,7777.136,But triggered by the loss of revenue on the wholesale side?,180,,
1182,0.97,7777.136,7777.803,Yes.,181,,
1183,0.97,7777.803,7786.979,And then can you also explain on slide four why the forecast for 2021 and 2022 is higher than the baseline?,182,,
1184,0.97,7786.979,7792.985,Is that just a typical forecasting --,182,,
1185,0.97,7792.985,7797.322,So that forecast is put together by our staff.,183,,
1186,0.97,7797.322,7807.366,"We have models that look at what Hydro volumes are forecast to be, what the prices are forecast to B and then it generates a Foecast.",183,,
1187,0.97,7807.366,7808.4,It moves around quite a bit.,183,,
1188,0.97,7808.4,7813.839,So it's a thing that we are constantly checking.,183,,
1189,0.97,7813.839,7821.246,"So Yeah, right now the baseline that we've set looks pretty conservative compared to the forecasts that we have right now.",183,,
1190,0.97,7821.246,7829.221,"As I mentioned, when we drafted this ordinance, I think the market prices in the Hydro was not quite as strong as it is now.",183,,
1191,0.97,7829.221,7830.589,So it's moving week on week.,183,,
1192,0.97,7830.589,7861.32,"And just to add on that, city light was in the process of slowly Ramping those down, so were we not having the--or expecting the year next year, which is a result of both what we expect to be a good water year where prices are currently, but also really importantly, the reduction in retail load associated with Covid means theoretically we will have more revenue to sell in the market.",184,,
1193,0.97,7861.32,7869.228,"Which is why you see us taking, you know, expecting higher levels potentially next year than we have.",184,,
1194,0.97,7869.228,7872.798,And it's part of why we're having a good year this year.,184,,
1195,0.97,7872.798,7877.536,It's also related to our participation in the energy imbalance market.,184,,
1196,0.97,7877.536,7887.212,"So you'll recall we went live in April, but again, that was the end of the winter weather where prices are typically higher.",184,,
1197,0.97,7887.212,7889.881,So those are part of the reason.,184,,
1198,0.97,7889.881,7911.67,"If those things weren't happening, what you would see for 2021, which is what was in our last strategic plan that is still in place, what you would see is $45 million because we were stair stepping down our projections each year to $40 million and then we hold.",184,,
1199,0.97,7911.67,7912.504,Okay.,185,,
1200,0.97,7912.504,7912.771,Thank you.,185,,
1201,0.97,7912.771,7913.905,Thank you.,186,,
1202,0.97,7913.905,7915.674,"Councilmembers, any final questions?",186,,
1203,0.97,7915.674,7916.141,Councilmember Strauss?,186,,
1204,0.97,7916.141,7922.114,"Thank you, chair Pedersen, and my apologies for always having so many questions.",187,,
1205,0.97,7922.114,7931.823,"Kirsty, such a great presentation and thank you for noting this is usually part of a larger package and we were expecting the strategic plan update this year.",187,,
1206,0.97,7931.823,7934.86,"Granted due to extenuating circumstances, Covid, we're waiting on that.",187,,
1207,0.97,7934.86,7944.803,"It's really helpful for me to understand that retail usage is hard to determine, this year even more difficult to determine.",187,,
1208,0.97,7944.803,7953.812,"And we know that retail demand is down, which makes us also need to shift to wholesale in a larger way than usual.",187,,
1209,0.97,7953.812,7960.852,"I've got a number of questions about wholesale, selling our energy on the wholesale market.",187,,
1210,0.97,7960.852,7985.043,"I guess one of them is how do we strategically sell our energy on the market, and what I mean by that is--I guess I'll just ask you all of my questions at once and let you go from there, which is how does selling on the wholesale market rather than retail impact the Whatter behind the dams?",187,,
1211,0.97,7985.043,7987.512,How do we strategically sell this power?,187,,
1212,0.97,7987.512,7995.487,Can we turn on and off our dam productivity to meet our retail needs?,187,,
1213,0.97,7995.487,8006.698,"And then to simultaneously when retail needs are low, can we turn the dam productivity on and off to sell our energy strategically at the highest rate possible?",187,,
1214,0.97,8006.698,8016.508,Can we control our load--is there any control that is we can put the load on our grid to strategically sell this electricity?,187,,
1215,0.97,8016.508,8028.12,"And then Finally, how does our depleted snow pack and the need to keep water behind the dams for future use impact the rate stabilization fund.",187,,
1216,0.97,8028.12,8029.788,Sorry for all those questions there.,187,,
1217,0.97,8029.788,8031.79,They're all at once.,187,,
1218,0.97,8031.79,8036.261,I have one question after that.,187,,
1219,0.97,8036.261,8037.596,"Kirsty, you follow up.",188,,
1220,0.97,8037.596,8038.196,Emeka's ready too.,189,,
1221,0.97,8038.196,8043.268,"Well, Emeka, if you want to talk about the dams, why don't you go ahead and talk about the dams?",190,,
1222,0.97,8043.268,8049.341,"I'm sure any of us could do a fine job here, but I'll give it a shot.",191,,
1223,0.97,8049.341,8070.929,"So I'll just say to the Councilmember, I think a lot of what you've mentioned is part of what makes the Hydro assets we have so important to the de Decarbonization plan.",191,,
1224,0.97,8070.929,8073.365,"So you know, our assets are very flexible.",191,,
1225,0.97,8073.365,8081.44,They certainly allow us to ramp up and ramp down and be very dynamic with how we use our energy.,191,,
1226,0.97,8081.44,8087.112,And therefore be very thoughtful and productive with how we play in the marketplace.,191,,
1227,0.97,8087.112,8097.989,"I think also, to your point about load control, you know, that is a really important point, an important part of the dynamic future grid that we're talking about, the grid modernization work.",191,,
1228,0.97,8097.989,8100.425,Think of it sort of like an equation.,191,,
1229,0.97,8100.425,8108.834,"When you only have the ability to control supply, you're much less dynamic than if you have some control over your demand, right?",191,,
1230,0.97,8108.834,8116.141,And so being able to control both sides of that equation is certainly something that we are after that is part of our strategic intent.,191,,
1231,0.97,8116.141,8128.52,And so we are looking at sort of flexible loads and dynamic loads and demand side management like demand response programs to help us increase our capabilities.,191,,
1232,0.97,8128.52,8134.693,And that will only become more effective and more useful and more valuable to us as time goes on.,191,,
1233,0.97,8134.693,8145.504,"Yeah, and I would just throw in and say so we operate Skagit and boundary, which are our two facilities.",192,,
1234,0.97,8145.504,8149.574,We actually are able to operate them strategically in tandem.,192,,
1235,0.97,8149.574,8159.584,"So we ramp up and we ramp down to take advantage of flows, prices, as well as the load curve for the city of Seattle.",192,,
1236,0.97,8159.584,8169.027,"And so we can, we do have within the bounds of our license, we have the ability to hold water, to move water.",192,,
1237,0.97,8169.027,8175.5,"Spill, which is, you know, typically a summer, early summer, late spring activity.",192,,
1238,0.97,8175.5,8179.538,Spill is when we're getting so much water from runoff and we don't have much able to control that.,192,,
1239,0.97,8179.538,8184.676,"So you'll look at a year and you'll say, well what does the year look like?",192,,
1240,0.97,8184.676,8185.41,What do prices look like?,192,,
1241,0.97,8185.41,8198.623,"A lot of that has to do with how quickly the things warm up, quite frankly, in the mountains and how quickly that snow Melts and the water comes.",192,,
1242,0.97,8198.623,8202.527,Because we are protecting fish.,192,,
1243,0.97,8202.527,8203.094,We're protecting recreation.,192,,
1244,0.97,8203.094,8203.695,We're protecting environment.,192,,
1245,0.97,8203.695,8206.031,"A good example, last year was a terrible water year.",192,,
1246,0.97,8206.031,8212.737,"And I don't remember the exact number, but I want to say we made like $14.7 million.",192,,
1247,0.97,8212.737,8217.809,"I'm going from memory, but it was a very low water year.",192,,
1248,0.97,8217.809,8221.546,"And partly, you know, it--that was very much about water.",192,,
1249,0.97,8221.546,8229.788,"And honestly, we never had enough water to even open the Skagit recreational facilities because water was so low.",192,,
1250,0.97,8229.788,8237.262,"When water's low, the interesting thing is, when generation is down because of the water year, prices do tend to go up.",192,,
1251,0.97,8237.262,8244.135,"So you'll make up some of what you lost in volume on price, but generally you'll never make up all of that.",192,,
1252,0.97,8244.135,8265.39,"Because even though there may be spikes, there'll be a day or, you know, there was a day in August where the region had troubles--so, you know, our goal continues to be to, as Emeka said, to make the best use of the resource.",192,,
1253,0.97,8265.39,8272.731,"And one of our strategies around that, which we will be bringing back to you when we bring our next strategic plan.",192,,
1254,0.97,8272.731,8276.768,We would have been bringing it to you sooner.,192,,
1255,0.97,8276.768,8290.348,Is to look at different pricing structures and potentially using a time of day rates that allow us to Insent customers to use less power during times when that power has the most value in the market.,192,,
1256,0.97,8290.348,8308.033,"By doing so, we would be able to sell more, increase our revenues, and then in turn, as you've seen through this presentation, that does fall back as a direct benefit to our rate payers.",192,,
1257,0.97,8308.033,8308.4,Thank you.,193,,
1258,0.97,8308.4,8309.534,That was very helpful.,193,,
1259,0.97,8309.534,8310.702,Did you get them all?,194,,
1260,0.97,8310.702,8313.505,You got most of it.,195,,
1261,0.97,8313.505,8314.572,"Kirsty, anything to add there?",195,,
1262,0.97,8314.572,8314.739,No?,195,,
1263,0.97,8314.739,8318.843,So I think you highlighted a couple things there that are really important.,195,,
1264,0.97,8318.843,8327.986,"I won't discussion boundary, but I will say that the Skagit dams are above our salmon runs is my understanding.",195,,
1265,0.97,8327.986,8337.562,"And so that, you know, as the Dam/Salmon conversation occurs, that is a benefit that the dam that is we have in the Skagit are above the salmon runs.",195,,
1266,0.97,8337.562,8342.067,And it's also really a benefit that the dams are Cascading.,195,,
1267,0.97,8342.067,8353.812,"And so as we diminish the water load behind one dam, it just flows into the next, which is a really important aspect of our ability to retain our water.",195,,
1268,0.97,8353.812,8359.25,"I guess my last question in here, it's kind of in the same vein I've been talking about all day.",195,,
1269,0.97,8359.25,8369.327,"I think I know the answer, but can we charge more money for clean electricity on the wholesale market?",195,,
1270,0.97,8369.327,8373.465,"Debra, you're on mute.",196,,
1271,0.97,8373.465,8374.466,"Yeah, that's a great question.",197,,
1272,0.97,8374.466,8383.608,"So, gosh, when I started in this industry, we were just forming markets, and there was no transparency and everything was a bilateral agreement.",197,,
1273,0.97,8383.608,8388.146,"Today we have very liquid, very transparent markets.",197,,
1274,0.97,8388.146,8411.669,"So you know, when you--when we are surplus, our Realtime trading floor is up there 24/7 and they are balancing, you know, within the hour, within the 15-Minute increments to make sure that the people that we serve here have everything they need and that we are able to take advantage of any surplus or purchase if we are short in the hour.",197,,
1275,0.97,8411.669,8413.004,So that's how that all works.,197,,
1276,0.97,8413.004,8421.546,"But the market sets the price, and the price is dependent on the qualities or attribute of the product.",197,,
1277,0.97,8421.546,8428.153,"So yes, one of the advantages to the Eim, when the Council at the time, you know, that was a big decision that was made.",197,,
1278,0.97,8428.153,8430.622,And it was a really important decision.,197,,
1279,0.97,8430.622,8444.869,"We were not the first public utility to join the Eim because we slowed our implementation slightly to allow the technology to catch up, but we were the first public utility in the region to make that decision.",197,,
1280,0.97,8444.869,8448.473,And it was largely an Environmentally-Based decision.,197,,
1281,0.97,8448.473,8462.921,"There are financial issues impacted, but what it does is it allows us to sell surplus power into California where there is a premium placed on the Carbon-Free attributes of our resource.",197,,
1282,0.97,8462.921,8483.007,"And so it's not that we can charge more, it's that the marketplace is--in most places a true renewable resource unless it's run a river or small Hydro, it is a Carbon-Free resource.",197,,
1283,0.97,8483.007,8496.621,"And that--those Carbon-Free attributes, especially as we think about Seda, or if we place a price on car ban, per se, that carbon -Free resource comes ever more valuable.",197,,
1284,0.97,8496.621,8516.341,"This will not be the first time we have discussions about this, because we are at the beginning of our Skagit Relylicensing process.",197,,
1285,0.97,8516.341,8519.644,"As we move through that process, that will be the issue.",197,,
1286,0.97,8519.644,8525.65,We want to do everything we can for fish and for the environment.,197,,
1287,0.97,8525.65,8532.423,"We want to value and support the indigenous populations and the people, the tribes on whose land we operate facilities.",197,,
1288,0.97,8532.423,8539.33,And we want to make sure that our resource remains economical and holds its value for the people of Seattle.,197,,
1289,0.97,8539.33,8541.666,So you're kind of going to be balancing all three of those.,197,,
1290,0.97,8541.666,8547.205,"At the end of the day, the Council will wind up learning quite a bit about that.",197,,
1291,0.97,8547.205,8550.608,I look forward to that.,198,,
1292,0.97,8550.608,8552.977,"And Kirsty, such a great presentation.",198,,
1293,0.97,8552.977,8554.879,"General manager Smith, amazing.",198,,
1294,0.97,8554.879,8556.047,Thank you for your leadership here.,198,,
1295,0.97,8556.047,8564.989,"Emeka, I couldn't--our city would be in a--we would not be in as good of a place were it not for you being here on our team.",198,,
1296,0.97,8564.989,8569.894,So thank you all for answering all of my questions.,198,,
1297,0.97,8569.894,8571.462,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",199,,
1298,0.97,8571.462,8577.201,"Any other questions, Councilmembers, before we move to adopt this Council bill?",199,,
1299,0.97,8577.201,8590.481,"Okay, seeing no further questions, I move the committee recommend passage of Council bill 119898, is there a second?",199,,
1300,0.97,8590.481,8590.882,Second.,200,,
1301,0.97,8590.882,8591.516,Thank you.,201,,

1303,0.97,8596.521,8596.955,Any final comments?,201,,
1304,0.97,8596.955,8605.496,"Okay, will the clerk please call the roll on the committee recommendation that this bill pass?",201,,
1305,0.97,8605.496,8610.001,Herbold?,202,,
1306,0.97,8610.001,8610.501,Yes.,203,,
1307,0.97,8610.501,8611.135,Morales?,204,,
1308,0.97,8611.135,8611.636,Yes.,205,,
1309,0.97,8611.636,8611.97,Strauss?,206,,
1310,0.97,8611.97,8612.203,Yes.,207,,
1311,0.97,8612.203,8612.337,.,207,,
1312,0.97,8612.337,8612.737,Chair Pedersen?,208,,
1313,0.97,8612.737,8613.037,Yes.,209,,
1314,0.97,8613.037,8614.572,"It's four yes, nobody no.",210,,
1315,0.97,8614.572,8623.414,"Thank you, the motion carries and the committee recommendation that the bill pass be sent to the October 5 city council meeting.",211,,
1316,0.97,8623.414,8629.454,"Everybody, this concludes the September 25, 2020 meeting of the transportation and utilities committee.",211,,
1317,0.97,8629.454,8636.461,The committee will be in hiatus for the Council's required 2021 budget process.,211,,
1318,0.97,8636.461,8640.631,"We will meet again Wednesday, December 2ND.",211,,
1319,0.97,8640.631,8642.2,"All right, thank you, everybody.",211,,
1320,0.97,8642.2,8642.7,Enjoy the weekend.,211,,
