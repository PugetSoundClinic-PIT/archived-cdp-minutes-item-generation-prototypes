91,0.97,457.723,463.029,We support the adoption of Council bill 119656.,9,,

114,0.97,555.354,561.193,And I think that one of the things that will be helpful is to expand our tiny House villages.,10,,

116,0.97,566.399,574.173,And we do believe that the best way to do this is to keep people stable enough so they can move on.,10,,

118,0.97,576.342,577.61,So their clothes can be clean.,10,,
119,0.97,577.61,579.278,That they can be clean.,10,,

138,0.97,634.4,636.969,So the ability to have a place like that.,11,,
139,0.97,636.969,641.14,To access the resources that Seattle and King county in general has.,11,,
140,0.97,641.14,642.441,I know it's fundamental.,11,,

206,0.97,942.141,948.681,And I was reading news articles and trying to get in contact with important people like yourself.,22,,
207,0.97,948.681,951.483,And I decided I wanted to do more than write a paper.,22,,
208,0.97,951.483,953.352,So I packed up my life.,22,,
209,0.97,953.352,954.72,And moved to Seattle.,22,,
210,0.97,954.72,956.188,And started working at Leehigh.,22,,
211,0.97,956.188,957.389,I thought I could learn more.,22,,
212,0.97,957.389,960.96,In the past seven months I learned that the tiny House villages save lives.,22,,
213,0.97,960.96,966.131,And I'm really grateful for all the residents here that you're going to hear speak about their experiences and their stories.,22,,
214,0.97,966.131,967.366,And I can't speak to that.,22,,
215,0.97,967.366,969.301,So I'm going to keep it short and sweet.,22,,
216,0.97,969.301,977.409,But I really hope that you take the time to listen and to hear them and just to make sure that you actually process what they're saying.,22,,

225,0.97,1017.883,1024.723,We cater to some of the most vulnerable adults that are experiencing homelessness.,23,,
226,0.97,1024.723,1038.57,And we have seen remarkable success with people who have only been able to look today today survival and suddenly they can envision a future in which they have an actual life to look forward to.,23,,
227,0.97,1038.57,1045.177,We do that right now with one full-time site coordinator.,23,,
228,0.97,1045.177,1046.412,And 1.5 case managers.,23,,
229,0.97,1046.412,1050.916,We could do so much more if we just had a little bit more.,23,,
230,0.97,1050.916,1056.555,The other thing is that we receive phone calls everyday wondering how people get in.,23,,
231,0.97,1056.555,1067.266,"If we had this ordinance to have more tiny House villages, we would have so many more opportunities to direct them into having their own tiny house.",23,,

270,0.97,1259.258,1262.227,I'm not going to talk about why we need more tiny House villages.,30,,
271,0.97,1262.227,1267.032,We have a lot of speakers here who can address that more eloquently than me.,30,,

273,0.97,1270.335,1274.439,We need more tiny House villages because we don't have enough affordable housing.,30,,

279,0.97,1303.068,1305.07,It gives us a way to connect.,30,,
280,0.97,1305.07,1309.274,It is in fact a community building opportunity for the whole neighborhood.,30,,
281,0.97,1309.274,1312.878,It's not the most important reason to support tiny House villages.,30,,
282,0.97,1312.878,1316.481,But it is one reason.,30,,
283,0.97,1316.481,1317.516,Tiny House villages connect us.,30,,

351,0.97,1662.427,1674.906,I'm a product of the 1965 immigration Act and had a very privileged life and a successful career and I started my own business in Seattle about a decade ago.,38,,
352,0.97,1674.906,1680.045,I lost my business and landed into homelessness last year.,38,,
353,0.97,1680.045,1688.086,"When I didn't have any family around me, and I ended up in my truck.",38,,
354,0.97,1688.086,1697.562,And it was pure hunger that drove me to search for free food and I ended up at the Elizabeth Gregory home.,38,,
355,0.97,1697.562,1702.567,"And from that, I ended up--I stayed in a shelter for about twelve days.",38,,
356,0.97,1702.567,1705.303,It was very difficult.,38,,

368,0.97,1753.751,1760.592,"And next, Michael foster, Kyle, I think it's Kyle Malone.",39,,
369,0.97,1760.592,1762.227,Theresa Hohmann.,39,,
370,0.97,1762.227,1763.962,And Maloney.,39,,
371,0.97,1763.962,1767.365,"If folks could please line up Ott the Mics when you're on deck, that would be great.",39,,
372,0.97,1767.365,1768.099,Thank you so much.,39,,
373,0.97,1768.099,1769.4,Thank you so much.,40,,
374,0.97,1769.4,1770.268,I'm Michael foster.,40,,
375,0.97,1770.268,1771.536,Thank you for this action.,40,,
376,0.97,1771.536,1777.976,After so many years of failure to act.,40,,
377,0.97,1777.976,1779.778,I am for tiny homes.,40,,
378,0.97,1779.778,1780.245,They work.,40,,
379,0.97,1780.245,1784.282,I'm happy to be neighbors with a tiny House village.,40,,
380,0.97,1784.282,1784.616,I love it.,40,,
381,0.97,1784.616,1785.85,Settler is a human right.,40,,
382,0.97,1785.85,1790.655,It's a shame when neighbors don't have shelter.,40,,
383,0.97,1790.655,1798.496,A shame for those of us with beds.,40,,
384,0.97,1798.496,1802.0,These tiny House villages are actually greener than my home.,40,,
385,0.97,1802.0,1804.169,I'm a climate activist.,40,,
386,0.97,1804.169,1827.525,"And I got to say, I'm really jealous sometimes when I look at the structures and I think climate emergency means our population is going to mushroom here in the Seattle area as we're one of the least effected areas in the country and people are burned out of places like Paradise and the flooding in the Midwest over the next few years.",40,,
387,0.97,1827.525,1830.328,So we're going to need every single tiny house.,40,,
388,0.97,1830.328,1834.566,Every single solution we can come up with for housing.,40,,
389,0.97,1834.566,1840.438,Cbs news just reported that we may see the end of the 30-year mortgage.,40,,
390,0.97,1840.438,1845.343,"If you take out a mortgage today, when will you pay it off?",40,,
391,0.97,1845.343,1846.811,That's not a good investment.,40,,
392,0.97,1846.811,1849.747,And you probably won't be able to keep insurance on that home.,40,,
393,0.97,1849.747,1852.05,So thank you for your bold Heeder ship.,40,,
394,0.97,1852.05,1854.619,We cannot do too much today.,40,,
395,0.97,1854.619,1863.094,[Applause].,40,,
396,0.97,1863.094,1864.696,My name is Theresa Hohmann.,41,,
397,0.97,1864.696,1866.664,And I'm so excited to be here.,41,,
398,0.97,1866.664,1869.901,I actually manage one of the tiny House villages.,41,,
399,0.97,1869.901,1871.603,It's Whittier heights.,41,,
400,0.97,1871.603,1874.239,It's our Ballard community and women only.,41,,
401,0.97,1874.239,1876.14,But they're all really great in what they do.,41,,
402,0.97,1876.14,1878.743,I love this program.,41,,
403,0.97,1878.743,1907.105,"Because the tiny House villages seem to me, having worked in permanent supportive housing for eight years and now switching over to the shelter side, it seems to me that they're cost effective, it's an ideal Steppingstone, and what I mean by that is they work because they give people who have been outside for a long time the opportunity to take their--like enjoy the space and get used to living in community, living with rules.",41,,
404,0.97,1907.105,1910.275,"And living with walls again, actually.",41,,
405,0.97,1910.275,1912.21,So they're perfect in that sense.,41,,
406,0.97,1912.21,1916.014,But that's not what makes them so awesome.,41,,
407,0.97,1916.014,1925.523,They're awesome because they create a space in which people can think and grieve and heal and move forward.,41,,
408,0.97,1925.523,1934.532,"And as a witness to that, it's--it's overwhelmingly joyful.",41,,
409,0.97,1934.532,1936.501,So thank you for seriously looking at this.,41,,
410,0.97,1936.501,1938.936,Because it really is making a difference.,41,,
411,0.97,1938.936,1954.519,"Having been a manager in permanent supportive housing, I would have asked less people to move out on a mutual termination because they would have all ready been used to those three things, walls, community, rules, and we wouldn't have had the problems we did had they not come directly from the streets.",41,,
412,0.97,1954.519,1957.021,"Thank you, your time is expired.",42,,
413,0.97,1957.021,1958.389,"Thanks, so they work.",43,,
414,0.97,1962.06,1962.226,.,43,,
415,0.97,1962.226,1974.972,"So a last call for the two remaining folks, Kyle Malone, and Loany Mcmertree if you're still in the room.",44,,
416,0.97,1974.972,1975.273,"Yes, sir?",44,,
417,0.97,1975.273,1977.542,I'm Kyle Malone.,45,,
418,0.97,1977.542,1980.144,I will just speak about personal experiences.,45,,
419,0.97,1980.144,1986.451,A lot of good facts but I have a traumatic brain injury.,45,,
420,0.97,1986.451,1992.457,And that has caused me a seizure disorder.,45,,
421,0.97,1992.457,1994.792,It's dangerous for me to be on the streets.,45,,
422,0.97,1994.792,1996.961,Especially on a night like that's night.,45,,
423,0.97,1996.961,1998.563,I don't know what it would have done.,45,,
424,0.97,1998.563,1999.597,I tried a tent city.,45,,
425,0.97,1999.597,2001.065,Better than being on the street.,45,,
426,0.97,2001.065,2011.642,"But still not the environment I needed to be in to stay away from alcohol, weapons, people that I just don't need to be around.",45,,
427,0.97,2011.642,2016.414,"When I found camp second chance, I was welcomed in.",45,,
428,0.97,2016.414,2019.484,They knew about my seizure disorder.,45,,
429,0.97,2019.484,2020.718,They didn't run away with it.,45,,
430,0.97,2020.718,2022.487,They helped me deal with it.,45,,
431,0.97,2022.487,2025.69,Most everyone there knows that I have it.,45,,
432,0.97,2025.69,2028.159,They get me to the hospital quick if that's the case.,45,,
433,0.97,2028.159,2031.462,They're taking great care of me.,45,,
434,0.97,2031.462,2033.398,"On the light side, we do have fun there.",45,,
435,0.97,2033.398,2035.199,We Cook food for each other.,45,,
436,0.97,2035.199,2038.936,It's a little community.,45,,
437,0.97,2038.936,2041.439,I see no reason why this should be stopped.,45,,
438,0.97,2041.439,2045.71,This is the best thing I've seen in treating homelessness.,45,,
439,0.97,2045.71,2048.513,I haven't seen anything like it.,45,,
440,0.97,2048.513,2051.115,Three different States being homeless.,45,,
441,0.97,2051.115,2051.349,Thank you.,45,,
442,0.97,2051.582,2055.52,[Applause].,45,,
443,0.97,2055.52,2064.595,And then the last call for Loany Mcmurtree.,46,,
444,0.97,2064.595,2065.43,She had to leave.,47,,
445,0.97,2065.43,2065.863,All right.,48,,
446,0.97,2065.863,2068.566,Thank you everyone for your public comment.,48,,
447,0.97,2068.566,2073.538,We can now proceed on with the agenda to items of business.,48,,
448,0.97,2073.538,2077.675,"First item of business, so Mr.",48,,
449,0.97,2077.675,2081.045,"Thorpe--well, there you are all ready up at the desk, Mr.",48,,
450,0.97,2081.045,2083.381,"Thorpe, will you please read item one into the record.",48,,
451,0.97,2083.381,2088.186,And will our Presenters please join us at the table.,48,,
452,0.97,2088.186,2099.43,Mayors office and Seattle human services Department briefing an update on the King County regional homelessness authority.,49,,
453,0.97,2099.43,2099.797,Thank you.,50,,
454,0.97,2099.797,2106.17,So we're being joined at the table by Tes Colby from the Mayor's office.,50,,
455,0.97,2106.17,2110.808,I believe we're also being joined by director Johnson.,50,,
456,0.97,2110.808,2113.611,We have not had the privilege of meeting yet.,50,,
457,0.97,2113.611,2115.046,So it's good to meet in person.,50,,
458,0.97,2115.046,2117.515,Before we begin our presentation.,50,,
459,0.97,2117.515,2120.351,Can we do a quick round of introductions from the Presenters.,50,,
460,0.97,2120.351,2132.83,"I want to acknowledge during the public comment period we were joined by Council member Strauss at the table, thank you, so with that, I'll let our Presenters introduce themselves.",50,,
461,0.97,2132.83,2134.999,"Tes Colby, office of the Mayor.",51,,
462,0.97,2134.999,2138.336,"Jason Johnson with the human services Department, hello.",52,,
463,0.97,2138.336,2143.074,"Thank you, and thanks for joining us here for this discussion.",53,,
464,0.97,2143.074,2151.649,"We're also joined from central staff, I'll let you make your introductions.",53,,
465,0.97,2153.351,2164.228,"So proceeding with this item, I have had the privilege of being recent Hi briefed on the progress that's being made with the regional homelessness authority.",53,,
466,0.97,2164.228,2176.774,"The appointments that we made on January 6th as a Council in our delegation to that authority which will be myself, council member Gonzales, and Mayor Dirken.",53,,
467,0.97,2176.774,2184.448,My understanding is that we still don't have an idea of the entire membership of that body or an official first meeting yet.,53,,
468,0.97,2184.448,2192.723,But mostly I wanted this to be an opportunity for the Council members to ask similar questions that I got an opportunity to ask at a previous meeting.,53,,
469,0.97,2192.723,2202.133,Just a general update on the road map of kind of where we are headed in the immediate and medium term future and even the long-term planning of the regional body.,53,,
470,0.97,2202.133,2213.11,And then just open it up and give my colleagues an opportunity to ask any additional questions that they would like to pursue.,53,,
471,0.97,2213.11,2213.377,Sure.,54,,
472,0.97,2213.377,2213.678,Absolutely.,54,,
473,0.97,2213.678,2221.786,So Jason and I are going to tag team a little bit on the presentation and likely on the answering of questions as well.,54,,
474,0.97,2221.786,2224.088,So just to begin this a little bit.,54,,
475,0.97,2224.088,2229.36,I want to do just kind of a quick reminder of what the Governance structure looks like.,54,,
476,0.97,2229.36,2231.429,I think you all got a version of it.,54,,
477,0.97,2231.429,2232.83,Yours is very small.,54,,
478,0.97,2232.83,2233.598,I apologize for that.,54,,
479,0.97,2233.598,2238.402,I have a larger one which I can share with you.,54,,
480,0.97,2238.402,2256.22,And just remind everybody what the Interlocal agreement that you all approved at the last council meeting in December really provides for in terms of the overview and Governance of the authority itself.,54,,
481,0.97,2256.22,2266.53,"So within the Ila, it provides for a two tiered over sight structure so the first level of that structure is the Governance committee.",54,,
482,0.97,2266.53,2288.686,"And as Council member Lewis just described, the Governance Committee is comprised primarily of folks who are in elected office as well as three members of--three representatives of folks who have immediate lived experience or who are working with and representing folks with lived experience.",54,,
483,0.97,2288.686,2291.055,I mean lived experience of homelessness.,54,,
484,0.97,2291.055,2305.87,"So yes, indeed, city Council and the sound city Association have identified their members, my understanding is that King County if not today will be doing their selection shortly.",54,,
485,0.97,2305.87,2314.779,And we are still working the continuum of care is helping with the identification of folks with lived experience.,54,,
486,0.97,2314.779,2323.187,So the goal is to have all 12 members in place at least identified as quickly as possible.,54,,
487,0.97,2323.187,2344.041,"Some of the first actions that the Governance committee will be responsible for will be, in fact, one of the sort of largest responsibilities will be in nominating and seating the second level of Governance if you will which is the implementation board.",54,,
488,0.97,2344.041,2355.319,So we are certainly feeling pressure and excitement about moving forward with the Governance committee.,54,,
489,0.97,2355.319,2384.849,"Just a question about my understanding of the Governance board where our goal is to meet end of January-February and we also have the all home continuum of care board that's working to identify, as you mentioned, thee individuals to serve on the governing board to represent their lived experience.",55,,
490,0.97,2384.849,2397.261,Is it your belief that the governing board will have it first meeting without their individuals since the governing board I believe appoints those individuals.,55,,
491,0.97,2397.261,2398.729,They're nominated by all home?,55,,
492,0.97,2398.729,2408.072,"Actually, it's going to be--not all home, but the continuum of care board that actually seats those individuals.",56,,
493,0.97,2408.072,2414.078,So they're going to work with organizations that will essentially make the nomination to the continuum of care.,56,,
494,0.97,2414.078,2416.38,"And then from there, they get seated.",56,,
495,0.97,2416.38,2420.684,I was under the impression that the governing board had a role.,57,,
496,0.97,2420.684,2425.756,"Governance committee does not have a role in seating those members, those folks with lived experience.",58,,
497,0.97,2425.756,2436.767,Sort of in the same way the Governance committee as a whole does not have a role in say Seattleing seating any of the elected officials.,58,,
498,0.97,2436.767,2443.841,"The implementation board, not for the Goraning committee.",59,,
499,0.97,2443.841,2449.814,It's that two tiered structure that I think will take us a while to get used to.,59,,
500,0.97,2449.814,2460.324,-- for the governing Committee--so with that clarification.,59,,
501,0.97,2460.324,2462.193,It certainly does.,60,,
502,0.97,2462.193,2464.428,So we're going to have one meeting with everybody there.,60,,
503,0.97,2464.428,2467.064,"Yes, and thank you for the reminder on that.",61,,
504,0.97,2467.064,2471.669,The goal would absolutely be not to hold a meeting without the folks with lived experience.,61,,
505,0.97,2471.669,2476.24,We want everybody to be on the same plain if you will when we start this work.,61,,
506,0.97,2476.24,2483.347,"And in terms of Council member Herbold, the Timeline that you just described, end of January is not going to happen.",61,,
507,0.97,2483.347,2487.718,Just because we're midway through January.,61,,
508,0.97,2487.718,2502.7,And there's still information of folk identification of folks to be had.,61,,
509,0.97,2502.7,2504.935,That is the should language.,61,,
510,0.97,2504.935,2506.237,Permissive not mandatory.,61,,
511,0.97,2506.237,2508.839,We're hoping that it will happen before 90 days.,61,,
512,0.97,2508.839,2513.41,"So within that time period, adds quickly as can be put together.",61,,
513,0.97,2513.41,2524.188,And the other thing to note is that that very first meeting will be Cochaired by the Mayor and the executive.,61,,
514,0.97,2524.188,2526.39,That's provided for in the Ila.,61,,
515,0.97,2526.39,2531.195,"But at that meeting, we're expecting that the committee will identify its leadership.",61,,
516,0.97,2531.195,2546.21,"Also identify the cadence of meetings, and begin the process of determining the process for and identifying who will be nominated and then seated on the implementation board.",61,,
517,0.97,2546.21,2548.012,Great.,62,,
518,0.97,2548.012,2548.312,Thank you.,62,,
519,0.97,2548.312,2565.796,"So some of the responsibilities of the Governance committee are some basic sort of General over sight responsibilities of, for example, creating by laws for the Goraning committee.",63,,
520,0.97,2565.796,2574.872,I know that's going to be one of the first activities that the committee will be under taking.,63,,
521,0.97,2574.872,2578.008,Confirming and or removing implementation board members.,63,,
522,0.97,2578.008,2582.413,Approving performance Metrics for the authority.,63,,
523,0.97,2582.413,2590.955,And approving the staff plan and the or chart for the authority itself.,63,,
524,0.97,2590.955,2595.859,All of those can be done with a simple majority.,63,,
525,0.97,2595.859,2615.112,"And those activities or responsibility has the need to be done with 3/4 majority and right now the way the--not just right now, forever more unless amended, the way the Ila is written is that 3/4 of the Quorum, which is nine members, so it's 9 of 12 members.",63,,
526,0.97,2615.112,2625.556,"At a minimum P/4 of the Quorum need to be present to approve goals, plans, and policies, to approve the budget, and to confirm the Ceo.",63,,
527,0.97,2625.556,2639.603,"And then removal of the Ceo has the highest standard for voting, and that requires an affirmative vote of all nine members.",63,,
528,0.97,2639.603,2642.74,So moving on to the implementation board.,63,,
529,0.97,2642.74,2643.641,Yeah.,64,,
530,0.97,2643.641,2648.512,I just want to flag part of the discussion last year.,64,,
531,0.97,2648.512,2664.528,"As it relates specifically to the changes that the governing board can make as it relates to major amendments to the budget as well as plans, policies, and goals for those amendments to prevail.",64,,
532,0.97,2664.528,2676.707,And I believe that the preference of this Council is not in conflict with the adopted Ila language.,64,,
533,0.97,2676.707,2684.548,"And there's been expression, via resolution of the Council's interest in working on this.",64,,
534,0.97,2684.548,2719.049,"And we've received written communication from both the Mayor as well as the executive to work to address the issue of raising the threshold for governing board to make changes to those policies I enumerated that the implementation board enacts and that would be to raise the total number of votes necessary to--from I think right now, based on I think the Quorum as it is now, it's--it would be six.",64,,
535,0.97,2719.049,2722.686,But we want to get it to a minimum of eight.,64,,
536,0.97,2722.686,2758.288,"With the idea, again, the implementation board is the--they are the experts in a very big driving goal of the regional body is to enhance the decision making of people with expertise in the field and who are somewhat insulated from public pressure, political pressure, to do things that may not be considered best practices.",64,,
537,0.97,2758.288,2771.268,So we identified--because of the way the composition of the governing board and the implementation board shook out after passage of the conciliation legislation and the county's legislation.,64,,
538,0.97,2771.268,2775.339,We flagged this as an issue that we want to return to in the by laws.,64,,
539,0.97,2775.339,2776.273,I'm just flagging that.,64,,
540,0.97,2776.273,2777.808,I know you're aware of it.,64,,
541,0.97,2777.808,2781.512,But just flagging it for my colleagues as well.,64,,
542,0.97,2781.512,2809.873,"In raising the threshold to eight, we're again making it more difficult for the governing board, which is a board primarily of Electeds, with the exception of the three individuals with lived experiences or accountable to people with lived experiences, it's goal is to make it a little bit more of a higher threshold to actually make changes no the budget, plans, policies, and goals, thanks.",64,,
543,0.97,2809.873,2811.341,Is that right?,64,,
544,0.97,2811.341,2811.642,All right.,64,,
545,0.97,2811.642,2815.345,[Laughter].,64,,
546,0.97,2815.679,2815.879,It is.,65,,
547,0.97,2815.879,2821.018,So thank you for that clarification as well.,65,,
548,0.97,2821.018,2827.357,Going on to the process for actually seating the implementation board.,65,,
549,0.97,2827.357,2849.58,"So what the Ila States is that the members of the Governance committee should work as quickly as they possibly can, expeditiously, and Collaboratively, to both establish a nominating process, but then also to actually vote on and seat the implementation board members.",65,,
550,0.97,2849.58,2855.018,The nominations come from all members of the Governance.,65,,
551,0.97,2855.018,2858.255,All the bodies of the Governance committee.,65,,
552,0.97,2858.255,2867.264,And so the way it breaks out is--it will be a 13 member board.,65,,
553,0.97,2867.264,2868.732,So two nominations.,65,,
554,0.97,2868.732,2873.837,Each by the county executive.,65,,
555,0.97,2873.837,2876.974,Two King County Council.,65,,
556,0.97,2876.974,2877.307,Two Mayor.,65,,
557,0.97,2877.307,2879.142,Two Seattle city council.,65,,
558,0.97,2879.142,2880.277,Two sound city Association.,65,,
559,0.97,2880.277,2881.745,That gets us to ten.,65,,
560,0.97,2881.745,2891.054,And then three additional nominations from folks with lived experience.,65,,
561,0.97,2891.054,2900.764,The implementation board designated three seats for folks representing people with lived experience or who have lived experience.,65,,
562,0.97,2900.764,2902.532,That's ultimately the number of seats.,65,,
563,0.97,2902.532,2907.471,That's how the placement of the seats get broken out.,65,,
564,0.97,2907.471,2908.071,Okay.,65,,
565,0.97,2908.071,2913.076,And how will this nominating board be stood up?,66,,
566,0.97,2913.076,2915.979,Or the nominating Committe be stood up?,66,,
567,0.97,2915.979,2923.287,What are the criteria for selecting each of the skills and expertise specified in the Ila?,66,,
568,0.97,2923.287,2929.293,And how long will it take to have them fully seated on the implementation board.,66,,
569,0.97,2929.293,2954.251,"Those are are all really excellent questions that I think we're still, and at this point, when I say we, the county, exec staff and the mayors exec staff are working together to come one a proposal that we think we can take to our bosses and then ultimately to our respective councils, to the Sca and the continuum of care for how that might happen.",67,,
570,0.97,2954.251,2957.988,Because the Ila left that all extremely open.,67,,
571,0.97,2957.988,2961.692,What it says is create a nominating process.,67,,
572,0.97,2961.692,2976.807,And so what we would like is to be able to offer for consideration a process that would identify what that nomination process will look like.,67,,
573,0.97,2976.807,2991.488,"My--in terms of the process for actually identifying who might be interested in the implementation board, I can say that it will definitely be a recommendation that that be an open process.",67,,
574,0.97,2991.488,2996.193,"And again, how actually that gets implemented is yet to be determined.",67,,
575,0.97,2996.193,3000.263,But that would be the recommendation that it be an open process.,67,,
576,0.97,3000.263,3005.969,Treated in the same way as we treat other kinds of citizen committees.,67,,
577,0.97,3005.969,3012.709,"Beyond that, I don't have very good specific answers for you yet on what the Timeline for that looks like.",67,,
578,0.97,3012.709,3022.986,Jason is going to talk to you a little bit in a minute about the Ceo recruitment process.,67,,
579,0.97,3022.986,3039.102,"And again, the sense of urgency that we all have around making sure that we both have an implementation board seated and feeling confident enough then to work with the governing Committee on that recruitment process.",67,,
580,0.97,3039.102,3044.174,Because we would really like to get the Ceo in as quickly as we can.,67,,
581,0.97,3044.174,3049.513,Because from there begins sort of all of the organizational structure and the staffing work that needs to be done.,67,,
582,0.97,3049.513,3063.927,"I can say that we share, or at least I personally share your sense of urgency, if there's anything we or I can do to assist you, when you Tom to have this criteria formed and the process formed, I'd love to chat further.",68,,
583,0.97,3063.927,3066.63,"Yeah, thank you very much.",69,,
584,0.97,3066.63,3076.54,I will flag the agreement makes reference that the follow Nateing Committee is reflective of the members of the governing board.,70,,
585,0.97,3076.54,3088.718,So the Council can also be part of conversations on how to begin convening that nominating committee and the processes in the same way that the Mayor's office or county executive's office can.,70,,
586,0.97,3088.718,3092.656,"Uh-huh, absolutely.",71,,
587,0.97,3092.656,3092.856,Okay.,71,,
588,0.97,3092.856,3093.123,Continue.,71,,
589,0.97,3093.123,3109.306,"So if you were able to read the diagram, which I will give credit to our colleagues in King County who love 11 X 17 Pagers.",72,,
590,0.97,3109.306,3124.654,"But the board is intended to be populated by 13 people with an entire array of expertise, experience, predominantly with the goal of making sure that there is strong over sight of the authority in its work.",72,,
591,0.97,3124.654,3130.126,But also strong expertise and subject matter expertise.,72,,
592,0.97,3130.126,3146.276,There's also a goal to make sure that the board is representative of pop Youlations that are--disproportionately impacted by homelessness.,72,,
593,0.97,3146.276,3148.512,That it has racial diversity.,72,,
594,0.97,3148.512,3155.418,And it be reflective of members of our community that are impacted by or engaged in addressing homelessness.,72,,
595,0.97,3155.418,3161.525,"Faith communities, Philanthropy, business communities, neighborhood associations, that sort of thing.",72,,
596,0.97,3161.525,3168.932,We talked a little bit about the seating the yet to be determined nomination process.,72,,
597,0.97,3168.932,3177.974,The implementation board has the general authority that you would think of that any normal board of directors owe of a nonprofit for example would have.,72,,
598,0.97,3177.974,3182.078,"That's developing policies, creating their own by laws.",72,,
599,0.97,3182.078,3182.646,Doing annual reporting.,72,,
600,0.97,3182.646,3184.614,So there's an annual performance report.,72,,
601,0.97,3184.614,3191.054,And an annual funding allocation report that will be given to the governing committee.,72,,
602,0.97,3191.054,3203.9,"The last thing that I want to mention and to remind everyone, because I know this came up quite a bit in our--as we were going towards the process of creating the Ila is the budgeting process.",72,,
603,0.97,3203.9,3221.551,"As the end of the date, the budgeting process for the authority's budget request will look very much like the current budgeting process that you all go through and experience with the current homeless services budget.",72,,
604,0.97,3221.551,3229.526,"Which is to say, the authority will do a draft budget, that will go through the implementation board.",72,,
605,0.97,3229.526,3237.834,So the first level of die hog back and forth--dialogue back and forth will be between the authority and the implementation board.,72,,
606,0.97,3237.834,3242.739,"Once the implementation board APPROVES the budget, that will go to the governing Committee for additional approval.",72,,
607,0.97,3242.739,3245.008,So they'd be making their recommendation.,72,,
608,0.97,3245.008,3248.612,That then would be the final budget that comes to CBO.,72,,
609,0.97,3248.612,3257.587,To the Mayor's office and get ultimately included in the Mayor's budget.,72,,
610,0.97,3257.587,3267.13,"Intermingled in all of this is the same level of dialogue that CBO and the Mayor's office currently has with, for example, the Department of human services.",72,,
611,0.97,3267.13,3269.733,That same back and forth and that same dialogue.,72,,
612,0.97,3269.733,3273.036,So we would expect to have that so there's no surprises.,72,,
613,0.97,3273.036,3275.839,What we want is the authority to be successful.,72,,
614,0.97,3275.839,3284.481,We wouldn't want the authority to just submit a budget that bears no resemblance to where--what the Mayor's budget is going to look like.,72,,
615,0.97,3284.481,3289.753,"Or more importantly, the dollars that will be available.",72,,
616,0.97,3289.753,3295.659,So this will be new for all of us as we go through this for the first time.,72,,
617,0.97,3295.659,3314.911,And that first time will likely--we thought that it would likely be for the 2021 budget and that's going to be highly dependent on the hiring of the Ceo and whether or not that Ceo is in place in time to be able to really start through that process.,72,,
618,0.97,3316.513,3316.646,.,72,,
619,0.97,3316.646,3316.913,Sorry.,73,,
620,0.97,3316.913,3318.915,Council member Peterson.,73,,
621,0.97,3318.915,3319.082,Hi.,73,,
622,0.97,3319.082,3329.225,Do you think that we'll definitely have something from the regional authority by the fall of 2021 for our budget process?,73,,
623,0.97,3329.225,3335.198,Which would then start spending the money January 2022 for programs?,73,,
624,0.97,3335.198,3335.999,Oh yes.,74,,
625,0.97,3335.999,3336.499,Certainly.,74,,
626,0.97,3336.499,3339.903,Certainly for the 2022 budget.,74,,
627,0.97,3339.903,3340.136,Yes.,74,,
628,0.97,3340.136,3341.204,It's only the 2021 budget.,74,,
629,0.97,3341.204,3345.108,So which means that they'd have to start this year.,74,,
630,0.97,3345.108,3350.714,I think there's questions about whether or not that would continue through the same Hsd process.,74,,
631,0.97,3350.714,3352.916,Which is feeling somewhat likely.,74,,
632,0.97,3352.916,3358.655,Or whether or not that would end up being for example a hybrid between Hsd and the new Ceo.,74,,
633,0.97,3358.655,3360.423,It's a question of timing.,74,,
634,0.97,3360.423,3360.69,Okay.,75,,
635,0.97,3360.69,3365.228,But fall of 2021 to implement January 2022.,75,,
636,0.97,3365.228,3369.232,"Yeah, Jason will talk about this a little bit more.",76,,
637,0.97,3369.232,3375.939,But the anticipation and our expectation is that the authority will be fully up and running.,76,,
638,0.97,3375.939,3376.539,Fully staffed.,76,,
639,0.97,3376.539,3379.242,"Fully operational on January 1, 2021.",76,,
640,0.97,3379.242,3379.743,Thank you.,77,,
641,0.97,3379.743,3383.046,So the last thing I'll say is about the continuum of care.,77,,
642,0.97,3383.046,3389.419,"Right now, all home--the continuum of care board is administered by all home.",77,,
643,0.97,3389.419,3393.289,Which is to say it's administered by King County.,77,,
644,0.97,3393.289,3402.098,And the way it is envisioned in this new structure is as an advisory committee to the implementation board.,77,,
645,0.97,3402.098,3407.17,And that advisory committee then would serve as the Federal continuum of care board.,77,,
646,0.97,3407.17,3416.679,"And remember, that the continuum of care board's primary job is to meet the requirements of the Department of housing and urban development, the U.S.",77,,
647,0.97,3416.679,3428.892,Department of housing and urban development when it comes to the award of their Coc funds previously known as McKinney Bento funds.,77,,
648,0.97,3428.892,3435.965,And the current Coc board is in the process of amending their charter to better align with the Interlocal agreement.,77,,
649,0.97,3435.965,3447.377,And determining a process by which they will also change their membership to better align both with HUD's standards of having a more diverse Coc board.,77,,
650,0.97,3447.377,3450.146,One that is more representative of the community at large.,77,,
651,0.97,3450.146,3455.952,And less sort of focused on providers.,77,,
652,0.97,3455.952,3464.06,And that also again sort of Aligns with the needs of the authority.,77,,
653,0.97,3464.06,3468.131,"And that is my--intended to be brief, overview.",77,,
654,0.97,3468.131,3468.832,Not so brief.,77,,
655,0.97,3468.832,3472.335,"All right, thank you so much.",78,,
656,0.97,3472.335,3475.972,Any final questions for Council member Strauss?,78,,
657,0.97,3475.972,3479.042,Thank you very much for the detailed memo.,79,,
658,0.97,3479.042,3482.412,The staff will be Colocated in late 2020.,79,,
659,0.97,3482.412,3485.281,Is there any way to speed that up?,79,,
660,0.97,3485.281,3489.919,"Or is there--I guess, also, what is the background on why we need to wait so long?",79,,
661,0.97,3489.919,3492.388,And I will hand that to Jason.,80,,
662,0.97,3492.388,3496.526,"Yeah, so again, Jason Johnson with the human services Department.",81,,
663,0.97,3496.526,3501.064,"Thank you, Tes, thank you Council, good to be with you.",81,,
664,0.97,3501.064,3504.067,I've been asked to offer two updates.,81,,
665,0.97,3504.067,3505.168,One on Co-Location.,81,,
666,0.97,3505.168,3511.307,And one on the recruitment process for a Ceo to the regional authority.,81,,
667,0.97,3511.307,3537.0,"As part of that Colocation update, first, you know, there is much to be done while we stand up a critical Governance infrastructure for the regional authority, there is work that cannot wait for all of those boards to be seated, for by laws to be written, and for that Governance structure to be in place.",81,,
668,0.97,3537.0,3539.702,There is some work that needs to be done now.,81,,
669,0.97,3539.702,3543.339,And work that quite honestly began at the end of 2019.,81,,
670,0.97,3543.339,3567.263,"And in order to do that, absent boards, absent a Ceo, Leo Fleur from King County Department of human services and I and Shannon out of the county executive's office have stood up a structure of a leadership team and a variety of different work groups.",81,,
671,0.97,3567.263,3586.649,"And these work groups, as well as the leadership team, are made up of employees from both King County Dchs and Hsd, the leadership team also has representation from the Seattle office of civil rights.",81,,
672,0.97,3586.649,3591.087,And King County's Esj office.,81,,
673,0.97,3591.087,3598.995,It has people with lived experience as well as employees from and leadership from the two departments.,81,,
674,0.97,3598.995,3600.997,So that leadership team is in place.,81,,
675,0.97,3600.997,3604.5,They meet every week.,81,,
676,0.97,3604.5,3605.702,Every Monday afternoon.,81,,
677,0.97,3605.702,3609.405,And they are the group.,81,,
678,0.97,3609.405,3613.71,The body by which information and decisions are moving through at this point.,81,,
679,0.97,3613.71,3618.247,There are also four work groups created.,81,,
680,0.97,3618.247,3632.095,"And staff, employees from both Hsd and Dchs as well as where appropriate from the Mayor or exec's office, and people with lived experience are participating in each of these work groups.",81,,
681,0.97,3632.095,3633.73,One is related to Colocation.,81,,
682,0.97,3633.73,3647.143,So this is a work group to move through the details of what it will take to move teams from three different locations into one location at the Yesler building.,81,,
683,0.97,3647.143,3649.312,There's a work group on program migration.,81,,
684,0.97,3649.312,3657.72,This is a work group focused on how we continue 2020's important work but also envision that work looking different.,81,,
685,0.97,3657.72,3663.76,And finding areas where we can merge efforts between the city and county now.,81,,
686,0.97,3663.76,3670.566,And where we need the authority to be up and operational in order to make change.,81,,
687,0.97,3670.566,3671.134,There's data migration.,81,,
688,0.97,3671.134,3675.638,Right now we use the homeless management information system at both the city and the county.,81,,
689,0.97,3675.638,3677.874,But we use data in different ways.,81,,
690,0.97,3677.874,3681.778,We have different reporting requirements.,81,,
691,0.97,3681.778,3686.883,We have different means of communication and Stakeholders that we communicate with.,81,,
692,0.97,3686.883,3703.9,And so we need a work group in place now to start thinking about data migration and how those data both the requests and requirements and the data Functionality can be consolidated into one.,81,,
693,0.97,3703.9,3711.007,"And then Finally, all of this work is centered on a very clear theory of change.",81,,
694,0.97,3711.007,3720.283,So there's a work group helping us better understand the equity based decision making tool that will be in place when this regional authority is stood up.,81,,
695,0.97,3720.283,3727.323,It's helping to ensure that the theory of change is ever presence as any of these work groups are doing their work.,81,,
696,0.97,3727.323,3735.731,So I'm just incredibly thankful that we have employees willing to raise their hand and participate in building this regional authority.,81,,
697,0.97,3735.731,3740.002,"Especially at a time when, again, we are absent a Ceo.",81,,
698,0.97,3740.002,3754.884,We are absent a board of Governance structure and really are relying on teams as they exist now to start envisioning how things could be different in alignment with the theory of change and the Interlocal that was passed.,81,,
699,0.97,3754.884,3758.888,"Mr. director, I think Council member Morales has a question.",81,,
700,0.97,3758.888,3764.727,You mentioned the Hmas information gathering system.,82,,
701,0.97,3764.727,3770.933,Can you talk about the changes that will be made in that process for data collection as it relates to racial equity?,82,,
702,0.97,3770.933,3782.278,"I know that there are concerns that the way data is collected is Disproportionally Impacting the ability of people of color, particularly native Americans to access some of our homeless services.",82,,
703,0.97,3782.278,3786.349,That's a body of work currently under way.,83,,
704,0.97,3786.349,3800.196,And there is a group of experts in the data space as well as program staff from both Hsd and King County Dchs who have been working on that issue and continue to do that work.,83,,
705,0.97,3800.196,3810.606,That work will not be part of what the data migration work group is looking at.,83,,
706,0.97,3810.606,3815.211,They're really diving into some functional detail.,83,,
707,0.97,3815.211,3822.318,"Just about how, quite honestly, about where staff will be seated.",83,,
708,0.97,3822.318,3826.589,How people will still have access to the data base.,83,,
709,0.97,3826.589,3830.193,They're doing an inventory of what reports are required at the city and County.,83,,
710,0.97,3830.193,3832.128,And what the timing of those reports are.,83,,
711,0.97,3832.128,3836.065,And trying to work through those kind of functional details.,83,,
712,0.97,3836.065,3849.745,But the work to be more equitable in both the collection of and use of data is something that continues to be looked at.,83,,
713,0.97,3849.745,3850.513,Herbohd.,84,,
714,0.97,3850.513,3853.015,Council member Morales.,85,,
715,0.97,3853.015,3856.018,I think part of what you're talking about.,85,,
716,0.97,3856.018,3857.22,I said Morales.,86,,
717,0.97,3857.22,3860.456,She just said it correctly.,87,,
718,0.97,3875.071,3902.665,"So I think part of what you're referring to is coordinated entry and the process by which folk Gose through coordinated entry get assessed for vulnerability and using that process yet referred to housing and that's another piece of, as Jason was describing, that's another piece of the data, data migration, and the--sort of the migration of Hmis and coordinated entry into the regional authority.",87,,
719,0.97,3902.665,3912.541,And there's a general agreement that the tool that's being used for those Prioritizations and for referrals needs to be Revisited.,87,,
720,0.97,3912.541,3920.283,"And in particular, because of the outcomes from the referrals, showing racial bias.",87,,
721,0.97,3920.283,3926.489,And it is something that is being found not just with our coordinated entry here in King County.,87,,
722,0.97,3926.489,3929.692,But in other communities that are using the same tool.,87,,
723,0.97,3929.692,3937.6,So kind of the good news is some of the work that was done here in King County to reveal that is really Resonating across the country.,87,,
724,0.97,3937.6,3939.835,But know that that's being addressed.,87,,
725,0.97,3939.835,3940.236,Thank you.,88,,
726,0.97,3940.236,3941.47,You're welcome.,89,,
727,0.97,3941.47,3951.38,Can you add in how Hsd is utilizing measuring length of stay and the Prioritization tool relative to the tool score.,90,,
728,0.97,3951.38,3956.118,And how much each composes your Prioritization.,90,,
729,0.97,3956.118,3958.487,I don't think I understand --,91,,
730,0.97,3958.487,3965.361,"That Hsd has been in the process of maybe 50%, I don't actually know the percentage.",92,,
731,0.97,3965.361,3967.363,That's what I'm asking.,92,,
732,0.97,3967.363,3973.302,"Of your Prioritization were to rely on your score, on this tool, the VI Spdat.",92,,
733,0.97,3973.302,3976.572,The other portion would rely on how long you've been homeless.,92,,
734,0.97,3976.572,3990.419,That was being examined and--to address the racial inequities would create if we only relied on the VI Spdat.,92,,
735,0.97,3990.419,3994.757,I'm happy to follow up and make sure you have that information.,93,,
736,0.97,3994.757,4000.496,And a finer point so I understand your question.,94,,
737,0.97,4000.496,4019.315,There's concern that the VI Spdat scores are resulting in low Prioritization for people of color who may not be considered highly vulnerable but they have been homeless for a very long time.,94,,
738,0.97,4019.315,4027.823,So we wanted to explore whether or not we need--in interest of promoting racial equity outcomes.,94,,
739,0.97,4027.823,4034.73,"Yeah, staff of the human services Department have gone deep into the data and what they believe it means.",95,,
740,0.97,4034.73,4037.199,So I'm happy to provide that information.,95,,
741,0.97,4037.199,4043.239,I want to just return to the staff transition process.,96,,
742,0.97,4043.239,4051.614,So our staff memo says in two different spots that the transition will begin in--in one place it says early 2020.,96,,
743,0.97,4051.614,4054.116,And in another place it says late 2020.,96,,
744,0.97,4054.116,4055.317,I just want to make sure.,96,,
745,0.97,4055.317,4057.453,I'll go through that process.,97,,
746,0.97,4057.453,4061.524,So it says early in 2020 and in another place it says spring 2020.,98,,
747,0.97,4061.524,4068.731,I want to make sure it hasn't slipped to late 2020.,98,,
748,0.97,4068.731,4068.998,No.,99,,
749,0.97,4068.998,4072.535,Not from either of us.,100,,
750,0.97,4072.535,4073.736,All right.,101,,
751,0.97,4073.736,4079.775,So the Colocation is still planning to happen some time in the spring.,101,,
752,0.97,4079.775,4081.911,I think you said late.,102,,
753,0.97,4081.911,4086.682,What we were talking about is budget.,103,,
754,0.97,4086.682,4093.556,Would happen in late 2020 to stand up the new organization fully in January of 2021.,103,,
755,0.97,4093.556,4100.396,But what I am prepared to walk through is the full Colocation Timeline.,103,,
756,0.97,4100.396,4101.43,That sounds great.,104,,
757,0.97,4101.43,4105.201,I might still have a few follow up questions but let's go for it.,104,,
758,0.97,4105.201,4107.937,We have a full agenda today.,105,,
759,0.97,4107.937,4112.842,To make sure we go through it quickly.,105,,
760,0.97,4112.842,4115.978,Change management at this scale is not easy.,106,,
761,0.97,4115.978,4118.147,Nor should it be taken lightly.,106,,
762,0.97,4118.147,4136.932,"And so in order to make sure that communication is flowing and that we are moving through this process with transparency as well as by asking questions and making sure that the best ideas are at the forefront, we're engaging with staff in many ways.",106,,
763,0.97,4136.932,4139.268,So we conduct weekly Huddles.,106,,
764,0.97,4139.268,4143.372,So the entire HSI division Huddles on a weekly basis.,106,,
765,0.97,4143.372,4148.611,There's also Email communication that goes out every week before those Huddles.,106,,
766,0.97,4148.611,4158.053,So this is an attempt to get information as well as communication out to each employee at the human services Department.,106,,
767,0.97,4158.053,4164.727,We have--I facilitate a Biweekly hr meeting.,106,,
768,0.97,4164.727,4181.277,"Hr professionals from the city and county join with the city attorney's office as well as the Mayor's office, leadership from Hsd and Dchs and the--those meetings are really laser focused on issues of labor.",106,,
769,0.97,4181.277,4187.149,Issues related to how we can support employees during this period of transition.,106,,
770,0.97,4187.149,4192.621,"Also mapping out items like Colocation, like the Ceo recruitment.",106,,
771,0.97,4192.621,4197.86,So it's a really critically important meeting for all of us that attend those.,106,,
772,0.97,4197.86,4211.373,And then we have our city attorney's office as well as the Seattle Department of human resources continuing to look at benefits.,106,,
773,0.97,4211.373,4226.088,"Making sure that when a transition to the regional authority occurs, there's comparable salary, benefits, pensions in place to help support employees in the manner by which they're accustomed to being supported at the city and the county.",106,,
774,0.97,4226.088,4240.936,All of this is happening so that the transition to the regional authority and Colocation at the Yesler building can be a smooth transition.,106,,
775,0.97,4240.936,4247.977,We are still on time and Manning for a March 2020 move to the Yesler building.,106,,
776,0.97,4247.977,4252.648,This is a move from--for Hsd from Seattle municipal tower.,106,,
777,0.97,4252.648,4262.992,And for the county from a billing on Jackson as well as staff who are located currently at the Chinook building.,106,,
778,0.97,4262.992,4264.793,So there are efforts under way.,106,,
779,0.97,4264.793,4272.301,Working very closely with the work group and King County facility's management to make sure that the building is ready in early March.,106,,
780,0.97,4272.301,4277.506,And so that staff can be ready to move at the end of March.,106,,
781,0.97,4277.506,4280.242,Council member Herbold do you have a question?,107,,
782,0.97,4280.242,4286.148,"A clarification, is the entire HSI division moving or just a Subset?",108,,
783,0.97,4286.148,4287.75,They are.,109,,
784,0.97,4287.75,4299.295,So a couple years ago there were individuals in the human services Department working on homelessness in a variety of divisions as well as leadership and administrative division.,109,,
785,0.97,4299.295,4311.94,And what we did a couple years ago was organize so that everyone working on addressing homelessness out of the human services division for the city was teamed in one division.,109,,
786,0.97,4311.94,4314.209,And so it's really that division.,109,,
787,0.97,4314.209,4321.984,"And there are resources in that division that are even related to financing, communications, and data that are --",109,,
788,0.97,4321.984,4326.588,I'm just trying to be sensitive to the chair's desire to get to the next item.,110,,
789,0.97,4326.588,4329.525,I want to get my questions out if I could.,110,,
790,0.97,4329.525,4335.431,"So it's not going to be a Subset of the HSI division that's moving, it's the entire division.",110,,
791,0.97,4335.431,4339.168,The entire division is Colocating.,111,,
792,0.97,4339.168,4340.235,Is being Colocated.,112,,
793,0.97,4340.235,4348.677,"After a Ceo is hired, they'll submit a staffing plan which will further explore what different roles and responsibilities are needed at the regional authority.",113,,
794,0.97,4348.677,4361.623,So I'm--the reason why I'm trying to get my questions out about this is that I'm hearing that there's a lot of speculations all ready about which positions are going to be eliminated.,114,,
795,0.97,4361.623,4373.102,"And if the Colocation isn't going to happen until March, and we're not getting a plan until I think the memo says either a supplemental in 2020 or with the Mayor's proposed 21 budget.",114,,
796,0.97,4373.102,4379.241,"I'm just curious as to--I mean, the speculations may not be true.",114,,
797,0.97,4379.241,4380.642,It's third hand information.,114,,
798,0.97,4380.642,4393.522,"But if it is true, I'm just trying to understand how that could happen given that the entire HSI division is being relocated.",114,,
799,0.97,4393.522,4393.822,Colocateed.,114,,
800,0.97,4393.822,4404.466,And we aren't making final decisions about who will stay with the regional authority until much later.,114,,
801,0.97,4404.466,4408.937,I'm just trying to get--is there something happening that we all should be aware of?,114,,
802,0.97,4408.937,4412.174,You accurately described exactly what's going to occur.,115,,
803,0.97,4412.174,4418.747,There's going to be a Colocation period that begins in March of 2020.,115,,
804,0.97,4418.747,4425.32,"Then after the hiring of a Ceo, we will begin what we're referring to as a loaned period.",115,,
805,0.97,4425.32,4429.458,This will be a period by which there is matrix supervision.,115,,
806,0.97,4429.458,4437.533,Where day to day operational decisions are made by the Ceo of the King County regional homeless authority.,115,,
807,0.97,4437.533,4444.439,But there will also be existing lines of authority back to the city and the county.,115,,
808,0.97,4444.439,4465.861,"It will not be until be--until the 2021 budget is passed in November for January 1, 2021 when positions the position budget and those pockets actually transition fully over to the regional authority.",115,,
809,0.97,4465.861,4476.371,So this is a Multiphased move that starts with Colocation.,115,,
810,0.97,4476.371,4490.452,"That begins to transition to more of a loan or matrix supervision phase once the Ceo is hired and ultimately in January moves to the full realization, fully staffed by the regional authority.",115,,
811,0.97,4490.452,4493.222,"Council member Sewant, do you have a question?",116,,
812,0.97,4493.222,4494.056,Not exactly a question.,117,,
813,0.97,4494.056,4495.257,But just a request.,117,,
814,0.97,4495.257,4499.962,We have the Presenters for the next committee here sitting for a long time.,117,,
815,0.97,4499.962,4502.965,I was not planning to be here until 6:00.,117,,
816,0.97,4502.965,4506.435,Because I have other issues also to get to.,117,,
817,0.97,4506.435,4518.08,"If this item is going to go on for significantly longer, can I suggest we do item two and come back to this.",117,,
818,0.97,4518.08,4525.12,And also I think we really have talked for a long time about the structure of this regional body.,117,,
819,0.97,4525.12,4534.663,And you used the term Colocation a number of times and the most substantive question was what is going to happen to the positions.,117,,
820,0.97,4534.663,4535.697,And I haven't heard.,117,,
821,0.97,4535.697,4537.232,Maybe you're not ready to answer that question.,117,,
822,0.97,4537.232,4541.537,But I feel like belaboring the details of the committee is not going to help.,117,,
823,0.97,4541.537,4553.048,There's not been one point made about what is the regional body going to actually do about home homelessness.,117,,
824,0.97,4553.048,4566.261,"But in the interest of the people who have come here for the most substantive issue in the committee, the tiny House village, actually providing some service, just a request.",117,,
825,0.97,4566.261,4566.862,"Sure, understood.",118,,
826,0.97,4566.862,4569.498,Ill like to move the agenda along.,118,,
827,0.97,4569.498,4575.437,I want to make sure my colleagues can ask all their questions about the authority coming together.,118,,
828,0.97,4575.437,4579.107,It's a big region al investment.,118,,
829,0.97,4579.107,4580.275,It warrants more time on the agenda.,118,,
830,0.97,4580.275,4584.146,I too would like to respect our Presenters time on the next item.,118,,
831,0.97,4584.146,4587.115,Which is an extremely important ordinance that we're going to consider.,118,,
832,0.97,4587.115,4591.787,I want to make sure while we have all the principles here we get questions of our colleagues out.,118,,
833,0.97,4591.787,4593.889,I think we're probably getting close to the end.,118,,
834,0.97,4593.889,4595.591,But thank you.,118,,
835,0.97,4595.591,4596.591,Council member Juarez.,118,,
836,0.97,4596.591,4597.326,Thank you chair.,119,,
837,0.97,4597.326,4604.866,"First of all, I want to thank you guys.",119,,
838,0.97,4604.866,4610.038,You guys Jason and Jess.,119,,
839,0.97,4610.038,4610.339,Thank you.,119,,
840,0.97,4610.339,4619.982,"We've been working on this issue, it started back in June or July, while I understand Council member Sewant's point about the time that we've taken.",119,,
841,0.97,4619.982,4624.92,I want to point out that we spent 90 minutes on a resolution that we didn't even pass.,119,,
842,0.97,4624.92,4626.421,So just holding that point aside.,119,,
843,0.97,4626.421,4641.403,"I want to give you all the opportunity because when we started this in June and July of last year, we went through all these different positions and laboring and Reconstructing, we thought we had it together, right before Thanksgiving, it changed again.",119,,
844,0.97,4641.403,4644.94,It's the first time that we've had a county response to homelessness.,119,,
845,0.97,4644.94,4647.109,I think it's important to point out.,119,,
846,0.97,4647.109,4648.176,It started with the city.,119,,
847,0.97,4648.176,4650.212,Now all of a sudden it's a a county response.,119,,
848,0.97,4650.212,4660.522,And now we have our governor saying Oh it's a statewide response.,119,,
849,0.97,4660.522,4662.958,"Former Mayor, Iman has a book coming out.",119,,
850,0.97,4662.958,4674.436,One of the tenants of the book is that it's going to be city councils and city representation and community groups that are the first wave to see any kind of conditions that hurt our people see it first.,119,,
851,0.97,4674.436,4677.539,And we have been saying to the state that homelessness is an issue.,119,,
852,0.97,4677.539,4679.641,We've been saying that since 2015.,119,,
853,0.97,4679.641,4681.743,And now we finally have a statewide approach.,119,,
854,0.97,4681.743,4682.778,We have a county approach.,119,,
855,0.97,4682.778,4691.253,And it's this type of briefing and understanding about what that mechanism looks like.,119,,
856,0.97,4691.253,4692.954,I was involved.,119,,
857,0.97,4692.954,4696.091,It will be Council member Lewis and Gonzales that will move this forward.,119,,
858,0.97,4696.091,4701.363,And we fought long and hard about the votes and how that's going to be in the governing Council.,119,,
859,0.97,4701.363,4702.731,We finally got it nailed down.,119,,
860,0.97,4702.731,4707.469,I want to hear why this is going to be implemented.,119,,
861,0.97,4707.469,4710.338,Council member Gonzales spoke eloquently about how we set the structure up.,119,,
862,0.97,4710.338,4711.74,How it will be a county response.,119,,
863,0.97,4711.74,4712.974,And how the voting will look.,119,,
864,0.97,4712.974,4716.211,And where the money will come from and how we're going to attack this.,119,,
865,0.97,4716.211,4720.048,While I do respect what Council member Sewant said.,119,,
866,0.97,4720.048,4724.386,And I thank her for ordinance she's bringing forward today.,119,,
867,0.97,4724.386,4729.925,"It Harkens back to 2015, we have to have extraordinary response to this condition.",119,,
868,0.97,4729.925,4737.599,Just like we tried to do the Opioid Overdose issues as well with the board of health.,119,,
869,0.97,4737.599,4742.637,"Getting back to my original question, I want to thank you for your hard work.",119,,
870,0.97,4742.637,4745.373,I'm glad we're here.,119,,
871,0.97,4745.373,4747.142,I didn't know if we were going to get here.,119,,
872,0.97,4747.142,4748.21,One of the questions I have.,119,,
873,0.97,4748.21,4750.145,Thank you for indulging me.,119,,
874,0.97,4750.145,4762.457,"How are we--has the Mayor said, or have we decided or have you talked about or what can you share about how we're going to go to look for this Ceo who is going to have to be a dynamic person for the city and the county.",119,,
875,0.97,4762.457,4765.193,And what it was like bringing all the cities into this.,119,,
876,0.97,4765.193,4779.574,"Switching it up from a PDA to an Ila, how will we go about looking for this dynamic individual that will attack homelessness and shelter the unsheltered and provide the money and leadership this county desperately needs.",119,,
877,0.97,4779.574,4779.941,Thank you.,120,,
878,0.97,4779.941,4783.879,Good and time Hi question.,120,,
879,0.97,4783.879,4799.394,"So the Ceo is going to be a dynamic leader who helps to shepherd this new, not just structure, but the implementation plan that the structure is going to be carrying out.",120,,
880,0.97,4799.394,4807.802,So it's incredibly--an incredibly important hire for this community to make.,120,,
881,0.97,4807.802,4820.782,And it also is written in the Ila that that new Ceo has only 60 days to come up with a full staffing plan for the regional authority after the day of their hire.,120,,
882,0.97,4820.782,4828.19,"So two months of they're hired, they need to submit to the city and county Council a staffing plan.",120,,
883,0.97,4828.19,4836.731,Back to Council member Herbo LD's point about the urgency.,120,,
884,0.97,4836.731,4847.008,"The longer we delay the hiring of a Ceo, the longer we sit without that staffing plan and the longer we have a work force who sits with anxiety about their futures.",120,,
885,0.97,4847.008,4857.552,So it's critically important not just for all of us who want to see measurable change as it relates to homelessness in this region.,120,,
886,0.97,4857.552,4872.601,But it's also critically important for our Timeline to get this regional authority stood up and make sure that we have the best and brightest people working as part of that organization to address homelessness regionally.,120,,
887,0.97,4872.601,4883.178,We have very recently in December and again this month will continue this Thursday working as an hr work group.,120,,
888,0.97,4883.178,4885.814,"Bobby Hume, I want to give a huge shout out to him.",120,,
889,0.97,4885.814,4889.651,He's been an incredible partner to me.,120,,
890,0.97,4889.651,4894.956,Designed what I believe is a very thoughtful process about exactly how we would bring the Ceo on board.,120,,
891,0.97,4894.956,4898.894,And that process is rooted in the theory of change.,120,,
892,0.97,4898.894,4908.737,We cannot just select a recruitment firm who currently does business with the city and expect that we're going to get the kind of leader that we want.,120,,
893,0.97,4908.737,4915.577,We want to make sure that we're selecting recruitment--a recruitment firm that's grounded in equity.,120,,
894,0.97,4915.577,4922.517,And that can carry out the theory of change as proposed in the regional authority.,120,,
895,0.97,4922.517,4932.427,"And so this Thursday, we'll be going through and walking through both the detail and the Timeline of exactly what selection of that recruitment firm could look like.",120,,
896,0.97,4932.427,4943.338,It is the role of the implementation board to actually be engaged with the recruitment firm and make a selection of the Ceo.,120,,
897,0.97,4943.338,4945.573,So there's only so far we can take this as staff.,120,,
898,0.97,4945.573,4949.044,But what we want to ensure is that that firm is ready to go.,120,,
899,0.97,4949.044,4957.686,"When the Governance structure is in place, that there's a firm in place who can immediately start Worning on that recruitment.",120,,
900,0.97,4957.686,4958.853,-- working on that recruitment.,120,,
901,0.97,4958.853,4962.023,We need to have that Ceo hired this summer.,120,,
902,0.97,4962.023,4972.967,"Any delay in getting that recruitment--that Ceo brought in to summer, then delays our ability to support that Ceo's staffing plan with budget in 2021.",120,,
903,0.97,4972.967,4978.373,So there's a really short window here for us to bring the right person on board.,120,,
904,0.97,4978.373,4985.58,But we're working diligently to ensure that we can get the right firm in place who can hire that Ceo.,120,,
905,0.97,4985.58,4987.315,"All right, well thank you so much.",121,,
906,0.97,4987.315,4991.353,I don't know if there's any last comments for my colleagues.,121,,
907,0.97,4991.353,4991.953,Council member Strauss?,121,,
908,0.97,4991.953,5008.57,"Thank you, chair, I just wanted to echo Council member Juarez's comments and thank Jeff, Tess, Tracy, and all the colleagues at King County sun Council for your fast work to get this done.",122,,
909,0.97,5008.57,5011.172,It was impressive to watch you work.,122,,
910,0.97,5011.172,5012.64,And I know it was no small effort.,122,,
911,0.97,5012.64,5013.475,So thank you.,122,,
912,0.97,5013.475,5019.981,And thank you to all the Council members here and director Johnson as well.,122,,
913,0.97,5019.981,5021.383,Can I make a request.,123,,
914,0.97,5021.383,5021.75,This is it.,123,,
915,0.97,5021.75,5023.418,And you can get back to me on this.,123,,
916,0.97,5023.418,5029.324,But I do have a question about what the process is for reviewing the effectiveness of the authority.,123,,
917,0.97,5029.324,5031.292,"It does say in here, or it doesn't say.",123,,
918,0.97,5031.292,5036.297,But you mentioned that the governing committee will approve performance Metrics.,123,,
919,0.97,5036.297,5043.238,So I'd just like a little more information about how we determine the effectiveness of the authority itself.,123,,
920,0.97,5043.238,5046.708,And how those--what happens if those goals aren't being met.,123,,
921,0.97,5046.708,5048.009,How do we course correct?,123,,
922,0.97,5048.009,5050.378,What's the plan of action for that?,123,,
923,0.97,5050.378,5050.678,Thank you.,123,,
924,0.97,5050.678,5052.514,"All right, thank you so much.",124,,
925,0.97,5052.514,5062.924,Thank you very much.,125,,
926,0.97,5063.291,5065.226,Now we will proceed to item two.,125,,
927,0.97,5065.226,5067.695,Will you please read the text of the item into the record.,125,,
928,0.97,5067.695,5071.332,And we have a couple Presenters on this.,125,,
929,0.97,5071.332,5074.035,I think we'll have all of them just come up at once.,125,,
930,0.97,5074.035,5078.239,I think there's enough space.,125,,
931,0.97,5078.239,5078.573,Mr. Thorpe.,125,,
932,0.97,5078.573,5082.644,Will you please read the item into the record.,125,,
933,0.97,5082.644,5105.6,Council bill 119656 on ordinance relating to land use and zoning providing transitional Encampments are allowed on any property owned or controlled by a religious organization without approval of a permit to permit transitional Encampments for home lest individuals as an interim use on publicly owned or private property within the city of Seattle.,125,,
934,0.97,5105.6,5118.847,And providing for renewal of temporary use permits as a type one decision for the director of the Seattle Department of construction and inspections briefing discussion and possible vote.,125,,
935,0.97,5118.847,5119.581,Thank you Mr. Thorpe.,125,,
936,0.97,5119.581,5129.691,All of our Presenters are still making that are way up--making their way up.,125,,
937,0.97,5129.691,5137.599,"I'll briefly say, first, I want to thank Council member Sewant.",125,,
938,0.97,5137.599,5144.806,I want to give Council member Sewant an opportunity to speak to the ordinance now.,125,,
939,0.97,5144.806,5145.14,Thank you.,125,,
940,0.97,5145.14,5152.013,And I want to thank everyone for their patience in getting to this item as well.,125,,
941,0.97,5152.013,5154.616,It's fine if you want to do introductions before I speak.,126,,
942,0.97,5154.616,5157.652,I think we're joined at the table by our Presenters.,127,,
943,0.97,5157.652,5160.021,So I guess starting with Mr.,127,,
944,0.97,5160.021,5168.329,"Freeman, we'll just go along and have folks state their name and where they work.",127,,
945,0.97,5168.329,5170.431,"Freeman, council central staff.",128,,
946,0.97,5170.431,5175.136,"Good afternoon, Council members, are we working here?",129,,
947,0.97,5175.136,5176.471,Yeah.,129,,
948,0.97,5176.471,5183.177,"I'm Peter Steinbrook, Cochair of the great Northwest sea port alliance.",129,,
949,0.97,5183.177,5187.916,"Sharon Lee, executive director low income housing Institute.",130,,
950,0.97,5187.916,5194.355,"My name is Joseph, I'm a consumer of the services of Seattle city.",131,,
951,0.97,5194.355,5197.659,I was homeless for many years here.,131,,
952,0.97,5197.659,5200.762,And now I have been stable in housing for the past year.,131,,
953,0.97,5200.762,5201.629,Thank you so much.,132,,
954,0.97,5201.629,5204.732,All of you for joining us here today.,132,,
955,0.97,5204.732,5207.969,Council member Steinbrook.,132,,
956,0.97,5207.969,5208.369,In particular.,132,,
957,0.97,5208.369,5211.206,In case we need you to fill out the Quorum.,132,,
958,0.97,5211.206,5214.876,I don't know if we might Miss a couple members and need to get up to five.,132,,
959,0.97,5214.876,5217.178,We'll tag you back in.,132,,
960,0.97,5217.178,5219.747,"That will be Council President, wouldn't it?",132,,
961,0.97,5219.747,5225.119,"Oh Yeah, former Council President, Peter Steinbrook.",133,,
962,0.97,5225.119,5227.221,We'll back to that side of the table.,133,,
963,0.97,5227.221,5229.357,Council member Sewant.,133,,
964,0.97,5229.357,5231.559,Thank you for bringing this forward.,133,,
965,0.97,5231.559,5233.561,Thank you so much.,134,,
966,0.97,5233.561,5233.895,Chair Lewis.,134,,
967,0.97,5233.895,5242.837,And thank you for scheduling this in your first committee select committee of homelessness that you're chairing.,134,,
968,0.97,5242.837,5264.759,I think many community members and also in common Council members have heard much eloquent testimony about the role that's being played by tiny House villages in this unprecedented and aging homelessness and affordable housing crisis that our city and region is facing.,134,,
969,0.97,5264.759,5266.561,Some of that testimony was hard today.,134,,
970,0.97,5266.561,5270.231,But I wanted to also add where we've come.,134,,
971,0.97,5270.231,5279.641,"We started talking about city authorized Encampments, many years ago before I was suddenly in city hall and others also.",134,,
972,0.97,5279.641,5288.082,"But it was in the 2014 discussion that we had that was my first year in city hall, through the people's budget movement.",134,,
973,0.97,5288.082,5290.451,How can we get authorized Encampments.,134,,
974,0.97,5290.451,5291.919,And city funded Encampments.,134,,
975,0.97,5291.919,5293.755,And what a long way we've come.,134,,
976,0.97,5293.755,5296.557,Especially I think in terms of public opinion.,134,,
977,0.97,5296.557,5301.296,I think that's a very important criteria to take into account.,134,,
978,0.97,5301.296,5302.463,There's tremendous public support.,134,,
979,0.97,5302.463,5308.269,I don't have a Randomized poll.,134,,
980,0.97,5308.269,5310.438,But I know it's shifted tremendously.,134,,
981,0.97,5310.438,5312.874,And in a positive way.,134,,
982,0.97,5312.874,5317.779,Contrary to the whole stories told by safe Seattle and speak out Seattle.,134,,
983,0.97,5317.779,5329.223,"I think the vast majority of ordinary people, housed people are welcoming homeless neighbors and recognizing this crisis is touching virtually every person.",134,,
984,0.97,5329.223,5334.696,I hardly know anyone who hasn't experienced it themselves or know somebody personally who's experienced it.,134,,
985,0.97,5334.696,5340.501,Ands a testimony to how strong that public public opinion is.,134,,
986,0.97,5340.501,5350.244,"When Mayor Dirken decided they were going to go ahead, the Mayor's office was going to Evict the North Lake tiny House village in the middle of winter.",134,,
987,0.97,5350.244,5359.02,"We, my office alongside community members set up a petition because we didn't--we thought it was unconscionable.",134,,
988,0.97,5359.02,5363.591,"But in 30 hours, we had 2,000 community members sign the petition.",134,,
989,0.97,5363.591,5365.393,We do a hot of organizing through my office.,134,,
990,0.97,5365.393,5373.134,That was one of the most successful examples of people coming together in solidarity with the North Lake village.,134,,
991,0.97,5373.134,5380.541,And then we forced the Mayor to back down on what would not have been good for our homeless neighbors.,134,,
992,0.97,5380.541,5386.481,And so I really appreciate the opportunity to frame what the intent of this legislation is.,134,,
993,0.97,5386.481,5391.886,And also just quickly give a summary of the steps that we have all ready taken to come to this point.,134,,
994,0.97,5391.886,5401.529,Tiny House villages as many have said in Seattle have been perhaps the most successful support for people facing homelessness.,134,,
995,0.97,5401.529,5405.333,"That they provide privacy, safety, and a place to store your belongings.",134,,
996,0.97,5405.333,5425.787,"Many have self management where residents are are in power to democratically run their communities and even based on the metric of the human services Department that is tracking transitions to long- term housing, Seattle's tiny House villages are far more successful than the enhanced shelters.",134,,
997,0.97,5425.787,5428.589,"And we know, this isn't always the best measure.",134,,
998,0.97,5428.589,5431.325,We don't have enough affordable housing to go around.,134,,
999,0.97,5431.325,5434.429,"Even by that measure, this is a remarkable success.",134,,
1000,0.97,5434.429,5437.865,They have the best track record of helping people find long- term housing.,134,,
1001,0.97,5437.865,5444.138,And they also have the best track record of providing decent and humane conditions in the interim.,134,,
1002,0.97,5444.138,5457.151,"And you know, obviously, the main conversation has to be about raising progressive revenues by taxing big business to provide that kind of affordable housing because the market is not providing.",134,,
1003,0.97,5457.151,5467.495,"But at the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that today people are suffering and tiny House villages are providing that lifeline.",134,,
1004,0.97,5467.495,5471.599,People shouldn't be left on the streets with nowhere to go.,134,,
1005,0.97,5471.599,5475.837,Tiny House villages can be built quickly and inexpensive Hi.,134,,
1006,0.97,5475.837,5480.575,We had a volunteer carpenter.,134,,
1007,0.97,5480.575,5485.446,There should be a tiny house for anybody with nowhere else better to go.,134,,
1008,0.97,5485.446,5488.449,It's a way to make it less harmful.,134,,
1009,0.97,5488.449,5495.089,Which has to do with why the transition to long-term housing are better.,134,,
1010,0.97,5495.089,5506.4,And one of the Edits to the existing audience is that the current ordinance expires at the end of March.,134,,
1011,0.97,5506.4,5508.302,But that's not the only change we want to make.,134,,
1012,0.97,5508.302,5520.181,"We want to make sure that the new legislation, the updated ordinance allows villages to continue to renew their permits as long as it's justify.",134,,
1013,0.97,5520.181,5523.417,Allow 40 villages in the city using this permit.,134,,
1014,0.97,5523.417,5527.488,Keeping in mind villages will not just spring up because this legislation got passed.,134,,
1015,0.97,5527.488,5528.789,We need funding to go with it.,134,,
1016,0.97,5528.789,5535.93,But at he's it makes sure that they can be located if we can find funding for them.,134,,
1017,0.97,5535.93,5548.643,"And then on the whole, you know, just to clarify, the ordinance--the new ordinance, if passed will still mean that tiny House villages need permits, permit applications need to be reasonable.",134,,
1018,0.97,5548.643,5560.655,This legislation is simply about eliminating blanket prohibitions on the citing of tiny House villages and the longevity of the tiny House villages which we feel should be based on the needs of our city.,134,,
1019,0.97,5560.655,5564.292,So we published this legislation from my office in August last year.,134,,
1020,0.97,5564.292,5569.73,"Since then, we've held several committee discussions on it in my committee last year.",134,,
1021,0.97,5569.73,5572.8,And now we're having this discussion in Council member Lewis' committee.,134,,
1022,0.97,5572.8,5581.409,We had a public hearing last year which included powerful testimonials from tiny House village residents.,134,,
1023,0.97,5581.409,5583.144,Some of them spoke today.,134,,
1024,0.97,5583.144,5591.118,And we completed the environmental review required for public or private development proposals under the state Environmental protection act.,134,,
1025,0.97,5591.118,5596.991,"And so all that remains is for us to, you know, have this discussion and then vote on the legislation.",134,,
1026,0.97,5596.991,5603.864,I hope that Council members find themselves prepared to vote the day.,134,,
1027,0.97,5603.864,5606.267,"But if not, then I would hope as soon as possible.",134,,
1028,0.97,5606.267,5612.006,"And I want to reiterate that my office, both my staff and I personally are available to answer any questions.",134,,
1029,0.97,5612.006,5616.477,"Thank you so much, council member Sewant.",135,,
1030,0.97,5616.477,5622.483,"And Mr. Freeman, I want to give you an opportunity to jump in if there's something you want to add as the central staff working on this.",135,,
1031,0.97,5622.483,5625.586,But before we turn it over to our Presenters.,135,,
1032,0.97,5625.586,5629.924,I'll commend to your attention the January 20th memo.,136,,
1033,0.97,5629.924,5636.53,Providing background information on the three regulatory processes by which a transitional encampment can be permitted in the city.,136,,
1034,0.97,5636.53,5645.339,And it talks about the proposed changes to the city's regulatory regime for transitional Encampments which is essentially what this bill would do.,136,,
1035,0.97,5645.339,5657.018,As Council member mentioned the bill would modify regulations and procedures for interim use Encampments and Encampments established through temporary use and accessory to religious organizations.,136,,
1036,0.97,5657.018,5668.462,"Most of the changes are for interim use Encampments, it would modify Locational criteria for the Encampments and expand locations in the city where they could be located.",136,,
1037,0.97,5668.462,5676.537,And do away with criteria that would otherwise apply and it RAISES the maximum number that could be established in the city from 3 to 40.,136,,
1038,0.97,5676.537,5699.96,"As the council member mentioned when the Council first established the interim youth's Pathway for permitting transitional youth Encampments, that was done in 2015 through ordinance 124747 and that ordinance has a sunset provision in it which would make it such that the interim use Pathway would expire March 31st of this year.",136,,
1039,0.97,5699.96,5701.062,"All right, thank you.",137,,
1040,0.97,5701.062,5705.666,And there will be an opportunity for follow up questions.,137,,
1041,0.97,5705.666,5715.076,"I would ask maybe after all of our Presenters present, just to kind of flag a road map on this ordinance.",137,,
1042,0.97,5715.076,5726.32,"It had an opportunity to speak at length with a number of my colleagues and Council member Sewant and just kind of talking about the ordinance, the history of it.",137,,
1043,0.97,5726.32,5731.158,The substantive changes that it will make to the current ordinance language.,137,,
1044,0.97,5731.158,5751.245,My intent at this time would be to strive to honor the deadline for the sunset that has been laid out by both Council member Sewant and Mr. Freeman from central staff and to--even though our next committee meeting is on February 26th.,137,,
1045,0.97,5751.245,5765.493,To hold a special committee meeting some time in the next two weeks to allow this conversation to sink in with everybody to give people the opportunity to consider potential amendments as we have this conversation today.,137,,
1046,0.97,5765.493,5780.341,I would just ask as a courtesy to central staff that folks considering amendments please give Mr. Freeman plenty of time to work on them early and distribute them so we can be prepared for that next Council meeting to possibly take action.,137,,
1047,0.97,5780.341,5797.191,I would like to honor that deadline to make sure that we have--that folks can rely on it and we're not in a place where a lot of these Encampments that have been very successful by a lot of Metrics will be displaced or put in jeopardy potentially.,137,,
1048,0.97,5797.191,5803.797,"So with that, I want to turn it over to port of Seattle Commissioner, Peter Steinbrook.",137,,
1049,0.97,5803.797,5806.7,Just by way of a little bit of background.,137,,
1050,0.97,5806.7,5810.905,Why is the port Commissioner here?,137,,
1051,0.97,5810.905,5819.113,One of my favorite tiny House villages as a council member is one of the ones located in district seven.,137,,
1052,0.97,5819.113,5823.717,Located near my apartment in uptown in inner Bay.,137,,
1053,0.97,5823.717,5827.021,I know a lot of the people involved and the governing board there.,137,,
1054,0.97,5827.021,5829.023,I've been very impressed by it.,137,,
1055,0.97,5829.023,5831.592,I believe the port of Seattle as well.,137,,
1056,0.97,5831.592,5839.433,And I want to call Commissioner Steinbrook to talk about the port's relationship with that community and I'll hand it over to you.,137,,
1057,0.97,5839.433,5843.003,"Okay, well, chairman, thank you very much.",138,,
1058,0.97,5843.003,5847.041,"Council members, I really appreciate your providing this opportunity.",138,,
1059,0.97,5847.041,5853.681,"Council member Sewant, thank you so much for your Proactive efforts in sponsoring the ordinance as well.",138,,
1060,0.97,5853.681,5858.586,And speaking to the core issues of why we have an epidemic crisis in this country.,138,,
1061,0.97,5858.586,5861.322,I want to give you a quick anecdote.,138,,
1062,0.97,5861.322,5867.928,I was thinking as we were talking here about my own experience working on homelessness and housing.,138,,
1063,0.97,5867.928,5878.372,"One of the first assignments I received like Mr. Lewis here, like Council member Lewis was to chair the housing human services Committee in 1997.",138,,
1064,0.97,5878.372,5878.872,Lisa remembers that.,138,,
1065,0.97,5878.872,5881.675,I was so pleased to have that committee.,138,,
1066,0.97,5881.675,5890.084,"Because for me, it cut to the core of what was our paramount duty, the human condition.",138,,
1067,0.97,5890.084,5891.452,"Yet, it wasn't easy.",138,,
1068,0.97,5891.452,5895.089,And I learned that many of my colleagues.,138,,
1069,0.97,5895.089,5898.492,Not to point fingers at anybody.,138,,
1070,0.97,5898.492,5904.665,But were somewhat indifferent and saw it as money down a rat hole to try to reduce the situation to reduce homelessness.,138,,
1071,0.97,5904.665,5909.837,Money down a rat hole I remember one Council member calling it that.,138,,
1072,0.97,5909.837,5913.974,So we've come a long way since then.,138,,
1073,0.97,5913.974,5923.35,"During that time, I worked to reduce homelessness through homelessness prevention.",138,,
1074,0.97,5923.35,5923.684,Rent support.,138,,
1075,0.97,5923.684,5924.551,Fighting for more money.,138,,
1076,0.97,5924.551,5927.054,"Back then, it doesn't seem like a lot today.",138,,
1077,0.97,5927.054,5939.767,But fighting for more money because it was very clear that there was no way we were going to really tackle the problem with solutions that were enduring without more money.,138,,
1078,0.97,5939.767,5949.71,We work to write the first city rules to legitimate tent cities and Decriminalize homelessness.,138,,
1079,0.97,5949.71,5953.881,Which had been many of the things considered criminal activity.,138,,
1080,0.97,5953.881,5956.116,Lots of experience back then.,138,,
1081,0.97,5956.116,5960.721,The strategic response was to ramp up Proactively the city efforts.,138,,
1082,0.97,5960.721,5969.93,We have tens of millions of dollars coming from the Reed tax this incredible prosperity the city was experiencing then.,138,,
1083,0.97,5969.93,5971.598,Some things have changed since then.,138,,
1084,0.97,5971.598,5974.535,We're far deeper into the crisis than we were then.,138,,
1085,0.97,5974.535,5978.038,Which is the most Disheartening thing for me to see.,138,,
1086,0.97,5978.038,5980.574,After all these efforts over the years.,138,,
1087,0.97,5980.574,5989.016,"The positive things are seeing the city and the county Council--excuse me, King County Council and the state start to align.",138,,
1088,0.97,5989.016,5993.153,That would be the first time that I can think of that that has ever moved in that direction.,138,,
1089,0.97,5993.153,6002.529,And I'm very optimistic about those efforts to see greater alignment and more resources coming from our entire regional partners here.,138,,
1090,0.97,6002.529,6004.398,Because we're all in it together.,138,,
1091,0.97,6004.398,6028.522,"And so from that standpoint, I'm really here to offer my strongest support for the model of tent cities--excuse me, the model of little tiny houses as a proven successful approach to leading people out of homelessness and into a permanent stable conditions.",138,,
1092,0.97,6028.522,6032.326,And I want to share the port's perspective on this.,138,,
1093,0.97,6032.326,6037.331,As the Leaseholder of the inner Bay safe harbor village.,138,,
1094,0.97,6037.331,6052.479,"Our partnership with the city of Seattle, the low income housing Institute, and Sharon and I go way back, the many faith bathe organizations who have been Yo woman's work for many years.",138,,
1095,0.97,6052.479,6058.952,The surrounding community members and the residents of the inner Bay village together have all been incredible.,138,,
1096,0.97,6058.952,6061.889,And I might add the surrounding communities.,138,,
1097,0.97,6061.889,6066.727,And I was pleased to hear comment about the Proactive support yes in my backyard.,138,,
1098,0.97,6066.727,6069.43,That wasn't true 20 plus years ago.,138,,
1099,0.97,6069.43,6070.931,It was strongly resisted all over the city.,138,,
1100,0.97,6070.931,6074.301,So I think the attitudes have been evolving.,138,,
1101,0.97,6074.301,6086.246,And I think the model of the tiny House has actually turned this around significant Hi in terms of public perspectives and community perspectives.,138,,
1102,0.97,6086.246,6090.951,And it's turned around because they see actual positive results.,138,,
1103,0.97,6090.951,6096.69,"They see conditions of--that are more decent, safer, and a sense of community.",138,,
1104,0.97,6096.69,6099.827,It's called the inner Bay village after all.,138,,
1105,0.97,6099.827,6102.629,And it is a little village.,138,,
1106,0.97,6102.629,6105.032,And we mustn't think of it as a permanent solution.,138,,
1107,0.97,6105.032,6107.668,But it's definitely a positive move in the right direction.,138,,
1108,0.97,6107.668,6109.903,And I think it's drawing national attention.,138,,
1109,0.97,6109.903,6118.579,"And it started here in Seattle I think with the many efforts involved so the name alone speaks to the sense of place, community from the start.",138,,
1110,0.97,6118.579,6134.061,"And we've been very pleased to have on our staff, Nick Schultz on the port closely involved with working with community members, the inner Bay village, and ensuring that we're addressing issues that may come up and concerns and all of that.",138,,
1111,0.97,6134.061,6140.033,"So we have a, liaison there as well to support these efforts.",138,,
1112,0.97,6140.033,6150.477,When the port was first approached in 2017 by the inner Bay magnolia community to consider leasing property to the city of Seattle for a tiny House village.,138,,
1113,0.97,6150.477,6152.513,It came from early efforts from the community.,138,,
1114,0.97,6152.513,6159.953,We worked with the city to initiate a robust outreach effort with the surrounding community that included connecting with 25 nearby businesses.,138,,
1115,0.97,6159.953,6170.797,"One of our own staff, Veronica Valdez was out on the street knocking on doors to survey the business response to this idea.",138,,
1116,0.97,6170.797,6173.066,The partnership only grew and strengthened over time.,138,,
1117,0.97,6173.066,6177.204,"As many of those businesses have donated food, clothing, and supplies to the village.",138,,
1118,0.97,6177.204,6180.007,How about that for a turn around?,138,,
1119,0.97,6180.007,6180.34,My gosh.,138,,
1120,0.97,6180.34,6185.245,That's bringing all the resources of the community to bear as we should be.,138,,
1121,0.97,6185.245,6192.586,"In November 2017, the port of Seattle Commission voted to approve the lease agreement with the city of Seattle for two years.",138,,
1122,0.97,6192.586,6199.693,"At the request of the city, this past summer, we extended that lease by an additional year through 2020.",138,,
1123,0.97,6199.693,6208.368,I was very pleased that the port Commission unanimously voted in support of doing so.,138,,
1124,0.97,6208.368,6212.573,"In October 8, 2019 at a meeting on October 8, 2019.",138,,
1125,0.97,6212.573,6221.048,"At the port, we Rewrote our core mission statement to include quality of life.",138,,
1126,0.97,6221.048,6226.153,While economic development is central to our Commission as a special purpose government.,138,,
1127,0.97,6226.153,6228.488,The quality of high of King County residents cuts to the core.,138,,
1128,0.97,6228.488,6236.396,And it speaks to our closely held values and shared values of making this tiny House village possible on port property.,138,,
1129,0.97,6236.396,6241.602,We continue to strive to be a responsible neighbor and a good steward.,138,,
1130,0.97,6241.602,6249.476,Port districts have broad authority as you know to lease land for such purposes and on such terms as the port deals proper.,138,,
1131,0.97,6249.476,6255.782,Which supports this lease to the city for the city's homeless program.,138,,
1132,0.97,6255.782,6265.425,"As a special purpose district however, you may know there are limits on the port's authority to take a more active Proactive role in the developing, operating, and owning affordable housing.",138,,
1133,0.97,6265.425,6271.198,"If you haven't had the opportunity to be there as a guest for a tour, I'd highly encourage it.",138,,
1134,0.97,6271.198,6274.835,It was an eye opener for me to say the least.,138,,
1135,0.97,6274.835,6279.373,I very much appreciated the time with the residents speaking directly to them.,138,,
1136,0.97,6279.373,6285.779,And staff and the time and attention that the staff is giving to the welfare of the residents.,138,,
1137,0.97,6285.779,6287.614,I always say that seeing is believing.,138,,
1138,0.97,6287.614,6291.852,"And when you're there, you feel a strong sense of pride, dignity, and hope.",138,,
1139,0.97,6291.852,6301.461,Each of these qualities are essential to the way you're able to see residents to be empowered with the help and support they need and deserve.,138,,
1140,0.97,6301.461,6307.1,We will never end homelessness until we have returned to a place of dignity.,138,,
1141,0.97,6307.1,6316.076,And I think one of the--maybe the intangibles of this experience with the little houses is restoring a sense of human dignity.,138,,
1142,0.97,6316.076,6318.712,"Because when you lose it, it's all lost.",138,,
1143,0.97,6318.712,6324.017,"When you've lost your dignity, there's really not a lot that's left there.",138,,
1144,0.97,6324.017,6329.756,And this model I think strongly supports that aspect of human need.,138,,
1145,0.97,6329.756,6330.09,And survival.,138,,
1146,0.97,6330.09,6338.198,Since the village opened its doors we've seen astonishing changes in people's lives.,138,,
1147,0.97,6338.198,6356.75,"Such as moving people's families from unclean and Unsanitary places to 45 units of warm and safe space, mutually supportive, Comanaged residents have access to running water, showers, kitchen SINKS and other amenities on site.",138,,
1148,0.97,6356.75,6359.186,That's essential to survival.,138,,
1149,0.97,6359.186,6362.589,"Everyday and every night at the village, there's a program manager.",138,,
1150,0.97,6362.589,6367.194,"And during the day, two case managers to support the village residents.",138,,
1151,0.97,6367.194,6369.796,This is a notion of housing first plus services.,138,,
1152,0.97,6369.796,6373.734,In order to stabilize people's lives.,138,,
1153,0.97,6373.734,6378.772,And the primary--people are are always questioning why so many homeless people?,138,,
1154,0.97,6378.772,6380.774,"Well, they've got mental illness.",138,,
1155,0.97,6380.774,6382.476,They've got drug addiction.,138,,
1156,0.97,6382.476,6384.478,"You know, this and that.",138,,
1157,0.97,6384.478,6389.249,"Well, the simple fact is one common denominator there is they're all poor.",138,,
1158,0.97,6389.249,6393.186,And that cuts across the whole spectrum.,138,,
1159,0.97,6393.186,6393.92,Why are they poor?,138,,
1160,0.97,6393.92,6398.692,We can speak to that in another conversation.,138,,
1161,0.97,6398.692,6409.469,But the income disparity and poverty more than anything that drives people into homelessness at some point in their life.,138,,
1162,0.97,6409.469,6415.308,"This model restores stability, safety, and security, and I think as I said, human dignity perhaps most importantly.",138,,
1163,0.97,6415.308,6419.246,"To date, more than 400 households have been served here.",138,,
1164,0.97,6419.246,6426.52,That really speaks volumes about the housing first supportive services strategy for moving people out of homelessness.,138,,
1165,0.97,6426.52,6434.394,And I think I imagine this is a widely recognized nationally as the most successful model that we have today.,138,,
1166,0.97,6434.394,6439.866,And I was an advisor to the National alliance to end home Lestness during my Council years.,138,,
1167,0.97,6439.866,6448.208,So I looked at it as a national crisis which I believe it's grown to become even more than 20 years past.,138,,
1168,0.97,6448.208,6458.785,Inner Bay village maintained a 46% exit for residents who Transitioned into permanent housing compared to 4% exit rate for traditional shelters.,138,,
1169,0.97,6458.785,6462.022,Those numbers are very impressive.,138,,
1170,0.97,6462.022,6469.629,"In 2019, inner Bay village provided shelter community to 100 women and men experiencing homelessness.",138,,
1171,0.97,6469.629,6478.338,In addition the port received almost no complaints from surrounding neighbors or from within the village itself.,138,,
1172,0.97,6478.338,6484.878,"If an issue does occur, the port is notified by the city of Seattle in a timely manner.",138,,
1173,0.97,6484.878,6487.948,So we have a partnership there.,138,,
1174,0.97,6487.948,6491.918,The city has no violations on the lease agreement.,138,,
1175,0.97,6491.918,6501.494,At the port we coordinate with organizations in conjunction with operators and case managers supported by the city and community to establish what was created there.,138,,
1176,0.97,6501.494,6508.568,The unique partnership has created a national model spearheaded by other projects and cities all around the country.,138,,
1177,0.97,6508.568,6513.073,Sharon Lee's phone is ringing off the look from around our region and nationally.,138,,
1178,0.97,6513.073,6525.418,We look forward to continuing our partnership with the city of Seattle and addressing the homeless crisis and further contributing to the quality of life of our residents by providing opportunities.,138,,
1179,0.97,6525.418,6530.257,"Thank you Commissioner, excuse me, that's me.",138,,
1180,0.97,6530.257,6532.158,Thank you Council members.,138,,
1181,0.97,6532.158,6533.426,I'm always doing that.,138,,
1182,0.97,6533.426,6539.499,I'm always reversing those things and Mayor Dirken for your leadership in supporting this joint partnership with us.,138,,
1183,0.97,6539.499,6543.37,"And more importantly, the community in making places like this possible for our residents.",138,,
1184,0.97,6543.37,6545.138,I'm happy to answer any questions.,138,,
1185,0.97,6545.438,6545.939,.,138,,
1186,0.97,6545.939,6556.116,"Thank you, Commissioner Steinbrook.",139,,
1187,0.97,6556.116,6556.449,Sharon.,139,,
1188,0.97,6556.449,6556.716,Sorry?,140,,
1189,0.97,6556.716,6557.951,I'm going to speak next.,141,,
1190,0.97,6557.951,6560.186,"Of course, yes, sir, please.",142,,
1191,0.97,6561.054,6561.221,.,142,,
1192,0.97,6561.221,6563.023,My name is Panda.,143,,
1193,0.97,6563.023,6564.524,My friends know me as Panda.,143,,
1194,0.97,6564.524,6570.564,I've been on the streets living here in Seattle fur or five years.,143,,
1195,0.97,6580.573,6585.378,I was in tent city drive when I got the news that we were changing.,143,,
1196,0.97,6585.378,6586.546,We were going to have houses.,143,,
1197,0.97,6586.546,6593.286,"We weren't going to live in cold, wet, leaking tents that would cause problems which is what most people on the streets live in.",143,,
1198,0.97,6593.286,6596.122,And they have to deal with Sweeps come through and taking everything from them.,143,,
1199,0.97,6596.122,6597.49,And then they have nothing.,143,,
1200,0.97,6597.49,6599.459,But I'm here to speak of personal experience.,143,,
1201,0.97,6599.459,6602.729,Because I lived in the encampment for 18 months.,143,,
1202,0.97,6602.729,6607.467,I've been in subsidized housing for over--about a year now.,143,,
1203,0.97,6607.467,6615.575,"And my experience when living in the village was, you know, everybody on the Streits, we all feel alone.",143,,
1204,0.97,6615.575,6619.212,We feel like we live in a broken society.,143,,
1205,0.97,6619.913,6622.582,That just leaves us in the gutter.,143,,
1206,0.97,6622.582,6623.583,Because people don't care.,143,,
1207,0.97,6623.583,6624.951,Because everybody is interested in money.,143,,
1208,0.97,6624.951,6628.588,And we don't have any money.,143,,
1209,0.97,6628.588,6636.396,"There's so many people--I was explaining to someone in past you see, why is there so many people homeless?",143,,
1210,0.97,6636.396,6643.603,What's the reason?,143,,
1211,0.97,6643.603,6648.241,Every one of those people has a different reason for being homeless.,143,,
1212,0.97,6648.241,6653.313,"You can't pin it on substance abuse, mental illness, societal norms.",143,,
1213,0.97,6653.313,6657.15,You can't put those restrictions and say that that's the cause of it.,143,,
1214,0.97,6657.15,6663.723,Because there's many more causes that what we are even aware of.,143,,
1215,0.97,6663.723,6670.196,Living in that encampment allowed me to reach out to others.,143,,
1216,0.97,6670.196,6671.231,To understand what their plight was.,143,,
1217,0.97,6671.231,6672.465,How they got on the streets.,143,,
1218,0.97,6672.465,6673.9,What they were living through.,143,,
1219,0.97,6673.9,6683.543,"It was a way for us to bond and come out of that hiding that we do when we're on the street, living on the streets.",143,,
1220,0.97,6683.543,6691.785,Because we don't want to be inflicted with somebody's bad words about our standards of our living.,143,,
1221,0.97,6691.785,6695.889,When it's bad enough that we have to live the way that we did when we did.,143,,
1222,0.97,6695.889,6727.687,"So I found that when we moved into a village and everybody got assigned to a house and we started doing our own Securities and managing our own encampment in the way that we performed our duties and performed outreach services to the community because I listened to the port commissioners and went to that meeting last year and it was surprising to hear because when we moved into that community, we had a lot of businesses that didn't want us there.",143,,
1223,0.97,6727.687,6736.93,"And then after being there for a year, and we go to the meeting and then the port says no, we had three or four of those businesses that said no before.",143,,
1224,0.97,6736.93,6744.504,But now they don't want you to leave.,143,,
1225,0.97,6744.504,6748.708,Because we did--we picked up trash.,143,,
1226,0.97,6748.708,6755.682,We did outreach to control the problems for citizens in the region.,143,,
1227,0.97,6755.682,6758.952,The other thing that worked well in the village was the Cac.,143,,
1228,0.97,6758.952,6769.829,We became more involved in the greater community around us to become part of that community.,143,,
1229,0.97,6769.829,6777.67,In a sense that we got together on a week Hi basis and decided what we were doing to make our community a better place to live in for ourselves.,143,,
1230,0.97,6777.67,6784.144,"What we needed to do to get out if the streets to make sure we were doing the right things to find housing, to find medical care.",143,,
1231,0.97,6784.144,6790.583,"To find all those services that somehow was a starting spot, the village was.",143,,
1232,0.97,6790.583,6800.894,Because we started to change and become back into a normal feeling of belonging and becoming part of society again.,143,,
1233,0.97,6800.894,6807.734,"I know for myself, speaking for myself, it was very hard to transition into that.",143,,
1234,0.97,6807.734,6818.044,"Because I lived so long on the streets and in my own mind, and not open and acceptable to anyone else and their thoughts of for one, why?",143,,
1235,0.97,6818.044,6820.28,What could be done?,143,,
1236,0.97,6820.28,6821.114,How could we help?,143,,
1237,0.97,6821.114,6823.449,Those were all key elements.,143,,
1238,0.97,6823.449,6839.866,"And the Cac involvement puts us on a one on one basis with other members of the society, the city, businesses, churches, to where we can participate with them and they understand our needs and wants.",143,,
1239,0.97,6839.866,6844.437,And follow through and help make that become a reality.,143,,
1240,0.97,6844.437,6850.61,That was the other thing living in the village was that we created our own reality.,143,,
1241,0.97,6850.61,6852.779,And I know I wanted housing.,143,,
1242,0.97,6852.779,6857.65,I know it took a long time to get housing.,143,,
1243,0.97,6857.65,6860.086,To get subsidized housing.,143,,
1244,0.97,6860.086,6862.455,I had a little social security money.,143,,
1245,0.97,6862.455,6868.228,I spent it as best as I could so when I got into housing I wouldn't have any needs.,143,,
1246,0.97,6868.228,6870.964,That's not a typical story for those out there.,143,,
1247,0.97,6870.964,6880.473,"There's others out there with no funding, no money, but they need the channels and the opportunities to get the medical help that they need, to get the mental help they need.",143,,
1248,0.97,6880.473,6885.945,"To get the social counseling, to get the drug abuse counseling, all the other needs that are there.",143,,
1249,0.97,6885.945,6892.352,"If we don't address any of those needs, then we go back into homelessness again.",143,,
1250,0.97,6892.352,6913.406,"I've seen so many people has their housing because of something that wasn't addressed, fixed, worked on, in order to make people sustainable to stay into housing.",143,,
1251,0.97,6913.406,6918.144,I was very thankful to be there and be part of that community.,143,,
1252,0.97,6918.144,6926.786,"I know personally I gave tours to people from different cities, counties, States, and countries, and nations from around this planet.",143,,
1253,0.97,6926.786,6932.558,"On the constant basis, daily sometimes two or three times a day, people want to know what is going on here?",143,,
1254,0.97,6932.558,6933.993,How do you do this?,143,,
1255,0.97,6933.993,6935.228,What's going on?,143,,
1256,0.97,6935.228,6954.547,"And so just leading tours and helping people better understand the whole process that was involved in the self managed village that was sanctioned by the city was very, very helpful in the sense that it helped me feel more like a contributing member of society again.",143,,
1257,0.97,6954.547,6984.911,"I just want to say, and take a moment to thank the city of Seattle, the city Council, the port authority, King County, the state of Washington, Lehi, all the other grass roots organizations, all the Cacs from the local areas for each community village and then as well as the churches and the individual citizens of Seattle who take their time to go and visit these Encampments and say Hey, what is it you need?",143,,
1258,0.97,6984.911,6991.15,What is it you have a want for?,143,,
1259,0.97,6991.15,7000.493,That alone builds such strength and development of being a human being and feeling like this is something that there's some compassion here.,143,,
1260,0.97,7000.493,7003.696,Because of the years--I'm 58.,143,,
1261,0.97,7003.696,7006.699,I've been homeless 23 years of those years.,143,,
1262,0.97,7006.699,7009.168,This last stretch was nine years.,143,,
1263,0.97,7009.168,7018.611,"And I'm very thankful--like I said, I've been in subsidized housing for about a year now, and I don't see any reason why I'll ever leave.",143,,
1264,0.97,7018.611,7022.281,Because I'm taking care of everything that needs to be taken care of.,143,,
1265,0.97,7022.281,7022.815,And that's important.,143,,
1266,0.97,7022.815,7026.519,But yet I'm also participating and trying to help make a better thing for the future.,143,,
1267,0.97,7026.519,7028.488,No one has an answer for this.,143,,
1268,0.97,7028.488,7039.665,It's going to take every single one of us in our own input in how we can do to help change this into a better way for the future.,143,,
1269,0.97,7039.665,7040.4,Thank you.,143,,
1270,0.97,7040.4,7045.571,I just appreciate the time that you've given me to speak.,143,,
1271,0.97,7045.571,7049.942,"Panda, thank you so much for coming here and sharing that with us as a committee.",144,,
1272,0.97,7049.942,7070.596,"And for that matter too, the folks that did provide public comment earlier who also Hi in some of these--live in some of these tiny House villages as a Council we look at a lot of these policies and percentages about exit rates and percentages about effectiveness and I think we forget sometimes that these aren't statistics.",144,,
1273,0.97,7070.596,7073.633,"You're not a Statistic, you're person.",144,,
1274,0.97,7073.633,7076.035,Everyone that had public comment earlier is a person.,144,,
1275,0.97,7076.035,7078.438,And I really appreciate you coming and sharing that story.,144,,
1276,0.97,7078.438,7079.939,That's why we're all here today.,144,,
1277,0.97,7079.939,7082.241,And thank you so much.,144,,
1278,0.97,7082.241,7082.575,So Sharon.,144,,
1279,0.97,7082.575,7083.576,Over to you.,144,,
1280,0.97,7083.576,7102.295,"Yes, I just want to clarify, Panda talked about the community advisory committees the Cacs, and one thing that's really good about the proposed bill is that it does require four new villages that they have a community advisory committee.",145,,
1281,0.97,7102.295,7117.009,"Currently, the advisory committees include seven Stakeholders.",145,,
1282,0.97,7117.009,7119.011,As well as neighboring community councils.,145,,
1283,0.97,7119.011,7133.126,So that's going to be a requirement in the existing ordinance that there be five to ten people and they basically meet on a monthly basis and they provide advice and feedback to the village.,145,,
1284,0.97,7133.126,7135.127,So that's a key part of the bill.,145,,
1285,0.97,7135.127,7141.0,"Just a clarifying question, is there not--I thought this was a Cac that's all ready part of the legislation?",145,,
1286,0.97,7141.0,7142.902,That's a current requirement.,146,,
1287,0.97,7142.902,7149.709,"Yes, but it's staying and possibly expanding in the new bill.",147,,
1288,0.97,7149.709,7153.179,So it allows for more people to be added to the Cac.,147,,
1289,0.97,7153.179,7167.527,And then the other thing I want to mention is that there's a power point that we proposed that we hope that you can view that because it does have some pictures of the villages and some statistics.,147,,
1290,0.97,7167.527,7174.367,And also we do offer--would like to offer a tour for people who haven't been to the villages recently.,147,,
1291,0.97,7174.367,7184.477,"So I think what's significant is that when the initial ordinance was put in place, people did envision and the city funded us to have tents on platforms.",147,,
1292,0.97,7184.477,7189.482,And so they were limited to like three sanctioned tent Encampments.,147,,
1293,0.97,7189.482,7196.722,"But now that we've Transitioned them to tiny House villages, and as a matter of fact, last year, we converted all the remaining tents.",147,,
1294,0.97,7196.722,7200.359,There were some villages that had tents and tiny houses.,147,,
1295,0.97,7200.359,7204.096,And we converted--we had people donate and build tiny houses.,147,,
1296,0.97,7204.096,7211.47,So now we've eliminated the--you know the small tents so now everybody has a tiny house.,147,,
1297,0.97,7211.47,7216.609,So we added 5--over 50 new tiny houses to the existing villages.,147,,
1298,0.97,7216.609,7222.782,"And in terms of Statistics, I do want to say something about this.",147,,
1299,0.97,7222.782,7227.086,"Last year, we sheltered 648.",147,,
1300,0.97,7227.086,7231.357,Close to 650 people in the tiny House villages funded by the city.,147,,
1301,0.97,7231.357,7240.933,And so we were basically housing 20% of the unsheltered people in Seattle.,147,,
1302,0.97,7240.933,7246.105,10% of the residents of the tiny House villages were children.,147,,
1303,0.97,7246.105,7248.04,Some of the villages have families with children.,147,,
1304,0.97,7248.04,7251.477,Some of them have adults and couples.,147,,
1305,0.97,7251.477,7254.247,One is for women only.,147,,
1306,0.97,7254.247,7257.316,All of them have allowed people with pets.,147,,
1307,0.97,7257.316,7273.265,"And then we also have a diverse mix of seniors, veterans, people of color, and so there's a lot of diversity and acceptance of people in the various villages.",147,,
1308,0.97,7273.265,7276.702,Four of the villages are self managed.,147,,
1309,0.97,7276.702,7277.069,Self governed.,147,,
1310,0.97,7277.069,7290.182,"They have in some case as site coordinator that facilitates resident participation, democratic decision making and the other four are staffed 24/7 like an enhanced shelter.",147,,
1311,0.97,7290.182,7293.152,"And as you know, some of the villages are clean and sober.",147,,
1312,0.97,7293.152,7296.355,Some of them are harm reduction.,147,,
1313,0.97,7296.355,7298.924,So it's sort of like what Panda talked about.,147,,
1314,0.97,7298.924,7301.594,There's a diverse need in the community.,147,,
1315,0.97,7301.594,7326.185,"So we have different villages depending on people's situations and we're taking people from the navigation team and with the Council's direction, I think we'll start taking people from lead and of course we have church referrals and referrals from like the urban League and the Seattle Indian center.",147,,
1316,0.97,7326.185,7330.823,So what is important about a tiny house is that it's heated.,147,,
1317,0.97,7330.823,7331.39,It's insulated.,147,,
1318,0.97,7331.39,7335.528,And the fire Department and public health actually comes and inspects.,147,,
1319,0.97,7335.528,7346.005,"So we have a smoke detector, a carbon Monoxide detector.",147,,
1320,0.97,7346.005,7347.907,"Fire Extinguishers, first aid kits.",147,,
1321,0.97,7347.907,7355.147,But this is like Council member Herbohd's emphasis.,147,,
1322,0.97,7355.147,7359.752,But we converted the port O Potties into plumed toilets and showers.,147,,
1323,0.97,7359.752,7363.355,"And we have laundry, running hot water in kitchens.",147,,
1324,0.97,7363.355,7369.161,We have refrigerators.,147,,
1325,0.97,7369.161,7369.428,Freezers.,147,,
1326,0.97,7369.428,7369.795,Coffee makers.,147,,
1327,0.97,7369.795,7370.663,Bread making machines.,147,,
1328,0.97,7370.663,7376.368,I mean we just have a lot of appliances that neighbors have donated to us.,147,,
1329,0.97,7376.368,7380.506,So you should come and experience the village.,147,,
1330,0.97,7380.506,7394.553,And I do want to say that we are showing the last figures are are showing that we have an exit rate to permanent housing of 40% from.,147,,
1331,0.97,7394.553,7397.656,Are you talking in general?,148,,
1332,0.97,7397.656,7399.658,I lost track because I was distracted.,149,,
1333,0.97,7399.658,7402.194,Are you talking about any specific village?,149,,
1334,0.97,7402.194,7404.563,Or over all?,149,,
1335,0.97,7404.563,7409.635,Over all.,150,,
1336,0.97,7409.635,7417.91,"So basically, third quarter of last year, the enhanced shelters had an exit rate of 23% to permanent housing.",150,,
1337,0.97,7417.91,7426.218,"During that same period, the city funded villages had an exit rate to permanent housing of 36%.",150,,
1338,0.97,7426.218,7432.391,"When we added the fourth quarter for last year, our exit rate to permanent housing is 40%.",150,,
1339,0.97,7432.391,7438.764,And then another 15% to Two- year transitional housing with case management.,150,,
1340,0.97,7438.764,7443.035,Essentially 55% exit rate to long-term housing.,150,,
1341,0.97,7443.035,7452.244,Transitional housing typically has a section 8. people get a section 8 and they get a case manager and then they get help with employment and housing.,150,,
1342,0.97,7452.244,7466.192,"So we think that the tiny House villages, we hear from the navigation team, where people who are are currently living in their cars, living on the street, unsheltered, this is their preference.",150,,
1343,0.97,7466.192,7471.397,They would like to move to a tiny House village opposed to a dormitory or a Sheller.,150,,
1344,0.97,7471.397,7472.331,All right.,151,,
1345,0.97,7472.331,7474.767,Are you ready to transition to questions?,151,,
1346,0.97,7474.767,7478.103,I didn't want to interrupt your presentation.,151,,
1347,0.97,7478.103,7480.94,But I'm sure that--I'm sure there's questions on the panel here.,151,,
1348,0.97,7480.94,7483.509,We also want to thank the Council.,152,,
1349,0.97,7483.509,7488.447,Last year the Council added 2 million for us to expand tiny House villages.,152,,
1350,0.97,7488.447,7498.724,So we're hoping to work closely with the human service Department to identify two or three additional sites for villages.,152,,
1351,0.97,7498.724,7501.861,And hopefully we can get one in the North end as well.,152,,
1352,0.97,7501.861,7506.866,"All right, well thank you so much everyone who presented.",153,,
1353,0.97,7506.866,7513.939,"Council member Sewant, kid you have a follow up question before I move on to other folks on the panel or the committee rather?",153,,
1354,0.97,7513.939,7520.713,Two quick observations following from some of the points that Sharon was making.,154,,
1355,0.97,7520.713,7534.793,"Sharon noted that we, as a council last year in the budget, we appropriated an additional--slightly over 2 million for additional tiny House villages.",154,,
1356,0.97,7534.793,7551.877,"And I think we also imposed, to your point for Prioritizing the referrals from the navigation team to the tiny House villages and also from the law enforcement assisted diversion program.",154,,
1357,0.97,7551.877,7568.36,"And also importantly, we--in the budget that the Council approved, we reduced by approximately 1.2 million an appropriation to relocate I would say dismantle two Encampments which doesn't make sense for all the points that you all have made.",154,,
1358,0.97,7568.36,7571.297,And all of that I'm reading from the memo.,154,,
1359,0.97,7571.297,7572.598,Which is excellent.,154,,
1360,0.97,7572.598,7585.177,"And then the last point is, Sharon was referring to the community advisory Council's committees--community advisory committees the Cacs.",154,,
1361,0.97,7585.177,7591.951,The bill in front of us--existing ordinance says no more than seven members.,154,,
1362,0.97,7591.951,7599.158,This is on page four of the version one of the ordinance.,154,,
1363,0.97,7599.158,7606.899,The improvement that Sharon was referring to says the committee shall consist of no fewer than five and no more than ten members.,154,,
1364,0.97,7606.899,7609.435,"So you're right, it is strengthening it.",154,,
1365,0.97,7609.435,7615.24,"Thank you, council member Herbohd.",155,,
1366,0.97,7615.24,7615.608,Thank you.,156,,
1367,0.97,7615.608,7623.082,"Chair, I want to differ to how you would like questions to be taken.",156,,
1368,0.97,7623.082,7625.284,I have some questions for Miss Lee.,156,,
1369,0.97,7625.284,7628.387,But then I also had a couple questions for central staff.,156,,
1370,0.97,7628.387,7631.023,Should we all ask our questions of Miss Lee first?,156,,
1371,0.97,7631.023,7639.098,"Since you have the Mic, now, council member Herbold, vice chair Herbold.",157,,
1372,0.97,7639.098,7645.738,Why not ask all your questions at once while you have the Mic and then we'll move on.,157,,
1373,0.97,7645.738,7653.012,"So for Miss Lee, I have two questions related specifically to the data.",158,,
1374,0.97,7653.012,7667.159,"I think I heard you give an Eczema nation for why it is on page, what is it, page 24, the exits to permanent housing were 34%.",158,,
1375,0.97,7667.159,7672.131,"But then on page 25, the exits to housing were 56%.",158,,
1376,0.97,7672.131,7674.9,Both under the heading of 2018 data.,158,,
1377,0.97,7674.9,7678.637,I think I heard you say something about adding an extra quarter in or something like that.,158,,
1378,0.97,7678.637,7690.082,"If I don't need it now, but if you could provide the back-up information at a later date so I can actually see how you got to that 56% in 2018, I'd really appreciate it.",158,,
1379,0.97,7690.082,7721.713,"And then as it relates to the previous page, which is I think page 23, you provide some outcomes related to a specific tiny House village, Lipton spring, and you report the demographic information associated with this particular village, it would be helpful, one, to know what the time frame is for the data.",158,,
1380,0.97,7721.713,7725.584,But also to get it for all of your villages.,158,,
1381,0.97,7725.584,7727.686,If that's possible.,158,,
1382,0.97,7727.686,7728.72,The demographic information.,158,,
1383,0.97,7728.72,7738.797,"The percentage of folks served that were Caucasian, black, native American, Hispanic, Asian, API and other and the average age and the gender.",158,,
1384,0.97,7738.797,7748.307,"So rather than just having it for one, if we could have it for all and also get a sense of over what period of time you're measuring it.",158,,
1385,0.97,7748.307,7751.577,That would be helpful and the data source.,158,,
1386,0.97,7751.577,7775.0,"And then some of the technical questions I have, so I'm having a hard time understanding the eliminating the requirement on the Encampments, the requirement for them to be accessory.",158,,
1387,0.97,7775.0,7789.414,"I thought by their very nature, so the way I understand, the city has been implementing our religious encampment ordinance, is we don't actually require that the land be adjacent to the religious facility.",158,,
1388,0.97,7789.414,7804.296,"But that by the very nature of the religious facility being in control of the extra land, their use of it if it is a use to serve homeless people is by it's very nature accessory.",158,,
1389,0.97,7804.296,7811.17,So I'm having a hard time understanding what the I him nation of access are RI accomplishes on the ground.,158,,
1390,0.97,7811.17,7812.504,-- accessory accomplishes on the ground.,158,,
1391,0.97,7812.504,7820.212,I think it would conform the code to the existing practice at Stci.,159,,
1392,0.97,7820.212,7830.088,As originally contemplated when Council enacted the change to the bill in 2011 the notion was that they were intended to be accessory.,159,,
1393,0.97,7830.088,7835.494,That was somewhat limiting based on what the state's statute required.,159,,
1394,0.97,7835.494,7838.797,The state statute uses the words owned and controlled.,159,,
1395,0.97,7838.797,7860.319,"So it wasn't just limited to accessory uses to acknowledge that Atci's permitting practice has been when there's not a church located on a site, using a church as a religious institution as an example, the Stci sometimes requires that a principle use first be established.",159,,
1396,0.97,7860.319,7862.187,That principle use could be a community center.,159,,
1397,0.97,7862.187,7865.39,Which shot in what folks imagine a community center to be.,159,,
1398,0.97,7865.39,7876.101,But land use code defines it as a place generally open to the public with a public purpose.,159,,
1399,0.97,7876.101,7878.237,So Sharon is familiar with the details here.,159,,
1400,0.97,7878.237,7892.584,"But in order to meet the accessory use requirement, Stci has sometimes required that a faith based host first establish her principle use on a site so that an encampment can been established as an accessory use.",159,,
1401,0.97,7892.584,7902.794,So there is some additional out of pocket cost potentially for a faith based organization that wants to host an encampment and cost when it comes to permitting.,159,,
1402,0.97,7902.794,7904.763,It creates a two-step process.,159,,
1403,0.97,7904.763,7909.701,Create a principle use first and name that principle use accessory.,159,,
1404,0.97,7909.701,7911.603,For an accessory use.,160,,
1405,0.97,7911.603,7918.176,"If it's truly a church site with a church on it, it may be the case that the faith based organization wouldn't need a permit at all.",160,,
1406,0.97,7918.176,7924.816,But if it's not accessory to a church on a site there's an additional step that needs to be accomplished.,160,,
1407,0.97,7924.816,7936.328,I've always--I found the concept helpful because to me it wasn't tied to the ownership or the tenure of the property whether or not it's owned or rented or its location.,161,,
1408,0.97,7936.328,7943.302,"It's a concept that by the merit of the church, it becomes accessory to the church.",161,,
1409,0.97,7943.302,7947.673,"So by removing that language, I think it's really important that we're really clear with the public.",161,,
1410,0.97,7947.673,7951.209,So we're not changing the concept.,161,,
1411,0.97,7951.209,7953.512,The concept is still the same.,161,,
1412,0.97,7953.512,7958.784,And it's about a religious institution's right to practice its mission.,161,,
1413,0.97,7958.784,7968.694,"And so by practicing its mission on a piece of property that they're in control of, whether or not it's ownership or rental regardless of it's location.",161,,
1414,0.97,7968.694,7974.333,That concept of accessory use is still embedded in the right.,161,,
1415,0.97,7974.333,7980.539,We're just not using the language because the language then triggers this sort of two step process.,161,,
1416,0.97,7980.539,7981.373,That's right.,162,,
1417,0.97,7981.373,7981.773,Yeah.,162,,
1418,0.97,7981.773,8001.626,"I think that the notion is that, you know, this Pathway, a religious organization land use Pathway derives from state Supreme Court decision in 201 when Woodenville sought to prevent a tent city from being established.",162,,
1419,0.97,8001.626,8014.606,And the state Supreme Court upheld that the constitutional protections in the Washington state Constitution provide freedom of conscience for a religious organization to host a tent encampment.,162,,
1420,0.97,8014.606,8025.817,There was a change in state law as a result of that Supreme Court case and I think that change happened in 2010 and the city codified that change in 2011 and it's pretty expansive.,162,,
1421,0.97,8025.817,8030.422,It doesn't just apply to Church-Owned properties.,162,,
1422,0.97,8030.422,8036.595,It also applies to any property that a church has a leasehold interest in.,162,,
1423,0.97,8036.595,8038.663,And is using that leasehold interest.,162,,
1424,0.97,8038.663,8039.731,A couple questions.,163,,
1425,0.97,8039.731,8041.333,But I don't want to monopolize.,163,,
1426,0.97,8041.333,8050.175,"I want to state, I'm being told by port staff that Commissioner Steinbrook needs to be excused for another appointment.",164,,
1427,0.97,8050.175,8057.716,"So I would ask with the permission of the committee that this presenter, witness?",164,,
1428,0.97,8057.716,8059.084,Still Transitioning from the courtroom.,164,,
1429,0.97,8059.084,8062.854,That this witness be excused.,164,,
1430,0.97,8062.854,8063.155,Presenter.,164,,
1431,0.97,8063.155,8064.823,This is so engaging.,165,,
1432,0.97,8064.823,8066.124,I want to help personally.,165,,
1433,0.97,8066.124,8067.592,I appreciate all you're doing.,165,,
1434,0.97,8067.592,8069.027,I've lost control of my life.,165,,
1435,0.97,8069.027,8074.433,[Laughter].,165,,
1436,0.97,8074.433,8076.501,Commissioner Steinbrook thank you for your presentation.,166,,
1437,0.97,8076.501,8078.236,It's good to see you back at the table here.,166,,
1438,0.97,8078.236,8079.171,Appreciate it.,167,,
1439,0.97,8079.171,8079.504,Thank you.,167,,
1440,0.97,8079.504,8088.58,Any other questions for the remaining Presenters from Council members? Council member Peterson.,168,,
1441,0.97,8088.58,8102.194,"Just in terms of the process today, I don't have any questions for Panda or Sharon Lee, but we going to talk about the legislation separately?",169,,
1442,0.97,8102.194,8102.427,Yes.,170,,
1443,0.97,8102.427,8102.627,Yes.,170,,
1444,0.97,8102.627,8102.828,Yeah.,170,,
1445,0.97,8102.828,8109.067,Hold your thoughts on that.,170,,
1446,0.97,8109.067,8121.113,I think actually most of my questions were answered by Council member Herbohd's line of questioning.,171,,
1447,0.97,8121.113,8128.92,"So I the, yes, I think they were in the follow up with Sharon.",171,,
1448,0.97,8128.92,8131.523,So I don't have any further questions either.,171,,
1449,0.97,8131.523,8133.925,"If there's no other questions, all the Presenters can be excused.",171,,
1450,0.97,8133.925,8139.965,And thank you so much for coming here and talking to this Committee.,171,,
1451,0.97,8153.578,8157.015,"So at this point, the presentations having been made.",171,,
1452,0.97,8157.015,8166.291,"The briefing having been conducted, it sound like Council member Peterson has thought nos share with the committee.",171,,
1453,0.97,8166.291,8168.126,If anyone else would like to.,171,,
1454,0.97,8168.126,8169.127,We can entertain that.,171,,
1455,0.97,8169.127,8172.197,I don't know how long folks want to stick around.,171,,
1456,0.97,8172.197,8202.027,"As I said earlier my intention today was going to be to have this presentation, to get all the information out there, to set a--and I'll coordinate with folks on setting another committee meeting so that we can have a full consideration and Airing of amendments and potential amendments if folks want to propose and just conversations internal Hi and with constituents on what folks think of the over all ordinance and how we want to deliberate on it.",171,,
1457,0.97,8202.027,8209.634,"But for now, if anyone does have general comments on the ordinance, I think this would be the appropriate time for us to have a brief discussion.",171,,
1458,0.97,8209.634,8216.408,But I want to be respectful of Council member's time and probably close this off at 4:30.,171,,
1459,0.97,8216.408,8220.845,"So with that, I mean we can start, council member Peterson, if you have some thoughts.",171,,
1460,0.97,8220.845,8226.017,"Thank you, and thank you Council member Sewant for bringing this bill forward.",172,,
1461,0.97,8226.017,8228.587,Thank you chair Lewis for bringing everybody here today.,172,,
1462,0.97,8228.587,8239.431,"And for everybody who came out to speak, I really appreciate it I used to work Ott the Department of housing and urban development during the clip on the administration.",172,,
1463,0.97,8239.431,8243.501,I would review grant requests that came into the cities for the homeless response.,172,,
1464,0.97,8243.501,8245.837,So Whenty any hem village concept first started here.,172,,
1465,0.97,8245.837,8260.719,"I was initially a Skeptic of it as I've told Sharon and have--when we got the new data in 2018 to show the exit rates had improved, that was really great news.",172,,
1466,0.97,8260.719,8273.698,"And so the exits to permanent housing were very impressive and we saw how over all, they were superior to some enhanced shelters.",172,,
1467,0.97,8273.698,8282.207,And I know that this--the current ordinance is expiring so we have an urgency issue here to extend it.,172,,
1468,0.97,8282.207,8290.849,And I really want to thank the walling Ford community in district four for being so welcoming of the village that's this.,172,,
1469,0.97,8290.849,8294.286,It's been there for a couple years now.,172,,
1470,0.97,8294.286,8300.792,And thank you for the tour of the true hope village in the central district which is very well run.,172,,
1471,0.97,8300.792,8310.168,"And I think that, you know, when we think of tiny home villages, we think of the four walls and a roof and a door the resident can lock on the inside.",172,,
1472,0.97,8310.168,8314.506,And the secret to success is really the case management.,172,,
1473,0.97,8314.506,8318.643,The professional effective case management that residents get.,172,,
1474,0.97,8318.643,8324.482,And not all villages have the same exit rates to permanent supportive housing.,172,,
1475,0.97,8324.482,8330.588,And those that have higher rates typically have better--more robust case management.,172,,
1476,0.97,8330.588,8338.496,"So what I want to point out is when I read this legislation, what I'm--I'm not reading a tiny home village bill.",172,,
1477,0.97,8338.496,8342.233,It's more of an encampment bill.,172,,
1478,0.97,8342.233,8346.404,And because the way--because tiny home villages are not defined in this bill.,172,,
1479,0.97,8346.404,8359.784,Instead the definition we're left with is transitional encampment which means a use having tent os ur a similar shelter including vehicles used for shelter that provide temporary quarters for sleeping and shelter.,172,,
1480,0.97,8359.784,8385.243,"And so I guess to honor the success of tiny home villages, just sort of speaking to potential amendments for consideration by the committee to actually put in that information, at least for new Encampments, because we're talking about expanding the number from 3 to 40, personally I think 40 is too high.",172,,
1481,0.97,8385.243,8387.379,We can talk about that later.,172,,
1482,0.97,8387.379,8390.148,But to grandfather in the ones that we have.,172,,
1483,0.97,8390.148,8395.887,But then to set a definition for what do we mean by a successful tiny home village?,172,,
1484,0.97,8395.887,8398.189,Do we actually mean a structure?,172,,
1485,0.97,8398.189,8401.292,And we mean case management and we mean security.,172,,
1486,0.97,8401.292,8407.332,So to put that actually into the legislation which is not there right now.,172,,
1487,0.97,8407.332,8411.803,And I really appreciate hearing about the regional homelessness authority.,172,,
1488,0.97,8411.803,8424.182,Because I think that also reminds us that we will have a group of experts that will be talking about how we're going to have a regional response.,172,,
1489,0.97,8424.182,8431.122,"So I look forward to whether the regional authority, whether what models they'll have.",172,,
1490,0.97,8431.122,8439.397,And whether they'll embrace tiny home villages or maybe defining those like I think we should do for this legislation before us.,172,,
1491,0.97,8439.397,8442.7,"So yes, extending it.",172,,
1492,0.97,8442.7,8443.067,Expanding it.,172,,
1493,0.97,8443.067,8451.109,But honoring that actual definition of what do we mean by tiny home village with case management.,172,,
1494,0.97,8451.109,8451.509,Thank you.,173,,
1495,0.97,8451.509,8456.748,I think that's a conversation that is very worth having.,174,,
1496,0.97,8456.748,8471.563,I think it's important to note for the historic record that I believe every tiny House village that we have in place right now started as an encampment.,174,,
1497,0.97,8471.563,8477.802,"So that's sometimes how--well, in our experience, it's exclusively, I believe, how they developed.",174,,
1498,0.97,8477.802,8487.846,"They started as Encampments, and as part of both the community engagement in my case at camp second chance.",174,,
1499,0.97,8487.846,8490.748,In district one.,174,,
1500,0.97,8490.748,8503.294,"Collaboration of a couple dozen churches have gotten together, worked with the encampment residents to slowly transform what is a tent encampment into a tiny House village.",174,,
1501,0.97,8503.294,8511.169,So I think it's really important to understand that that is the history of how it's worked here.,174,,
1502,0.97,8511.169,8515.573,And it might have really something to do with their success.,174,,
1503,0.97,8515.573,8527.952,Because there is that really strong community engagement component that goes beyond the residents of the encampment itself.,174,,
1504,0.97,8527.952,8540.798,I have a question on the removal of the set back from adjacent residential lots by 25 feet.,174,,
1505,0.97,8540.798,8549.841,Am I correct in that we've removed that requirement because we're allowing--you can't have a it is back from yourself.,174,,
1506,0.97,8549.841,8559.05,"We under this proposed ordinance, we would be allowing encampment locations to be on residentially zoned properties.",174,,
1507,0.97,8559.05,8568.293,So you can't set back from the residentially zoned property if you're located on residentially zoned property.,174,,
1508,0.97,8568.293,8577.769,They can be only located in commercial and industrial zones so there's a set back requirement that contemplates a scenario.,175,,
1509,0.97,8577.769,8587.245,So the set back requirement obviously is not necessary if the criteria are are expanded to include single family and multifamily zones as well.,175,,
1510,0.97,8587.245,8599.39,"Just to be clear, Encampments established through a temporary use process or as accessory to a faith based organization can be located any where in city.",175,,
1511,0.97,8599.39,8619.31,I am interested in the concept of not a set back from just generally adjacent residential lots because that again is not compatible with the proposed legislation that would allow Encampments in residential zoned areas.,176,,
1512,0.97,8619.31,8633.891,But I would be interested in considering or exploring some sort of a set back from a improved residentially zoned lot that's occupied.,176,,
1513,0.97,8633.891,8641.232,Just again with recognition and that's another piece of data that would be useful.,176,,
1514,0.97,8641.232,8647.705,To have a little bit of an understanding what the closest neighbor is in our current practice.,176,,
1515,0.97,8647.705,8656.714,"And just to get a little bit of a sense, particularly in those instances that Encampments have started out as outdoor Encampments.",176,,
1516,0.97,8656.714,8660.618,What has been the city's practice in working to site these.,176,,
1517,0.97,8660.618,8672.997,And so I would be interested in getting a little bit more Granularity both on the practice and then considering potentially a mandatory language based on that practice.,176,,
1518,0.97,8672.997,8675.6,I can see what I can discover.,177,,
1519,0.97,8675.6,8678.236,Just by way of a reminder.,177,,
1520,0.97,8678.236,8680.905,I think the committee is aware of this.,177,,
1521,0.97,8680.905,8683.574,But it's maybe not as obvious to folks that are watching.,177,,
1522,0.97,8683.574,8689.38,A lot of commercial zones are de facto multifamily zones.,177,,
1523,0.97,8689.38,8699.857,Most residential growth occurs in neighborhood commercial areas so the set back is in some ways a development standard that either would equally be applied wherever it is.,177,,
1524,0.97,8699.857,8707.065,Or may have a limited utility just based on the fact that we see a lot of residential development in commercial zones.,177,,
1525,0.97,8707.065,8709.333,I just have one more I want to flag.,178,,
1526,0.97,8709.333,8712.203,"Yes, council member.",179,,
1527,0.97,8712.203,8719.977,We are proposing to eliminate the requirement that villages be located at least a mile away from each other.,180,,
1528,0.97,8719.977,8738.729,"My district specifically, Highland park has been hosting an encampment location at camp second chance for about three years and prior to that down the hill, very nearby, was hosted Nickelsville for quite some time.",180,,
1529,0.97,8738.729,8765.89,"And I know that in order to do a faithful job in representing my constituents in Highland Park, it would be really important to them to see some sort of geographic equity considering the number of years that that that one neighborhood, the only neighborhood in district one has hosted an Encampment/Tiny home village.",180,,
1530,0.97,8765.89,8786.778,"So if we're going to remove the one mile away location limitation, I think we need to insert something else that expresses our expectations for geographic equity, particularly as it relates to low income communities of color.",180,,
1531,0.97,8786.778,8791.048,And I think your map that you have here demonstrates that really well.,180,,
1532,0.97,8791.048,8798.055,"And I recognize that when we open up more hand, we might not see some of the patterns that we currently see.",180,,
1533,0.97,8798.055,8798.856,Thank you.,181,,
1534,0.97,8798.856,8812.303,"Just to clarify, meaning geographic equity meaning we don't want the location or the citing of the dining house to be disproportionate in low income communities of color.",182,,
1535,0.97,8812.303,8818.776,"Thank you, any other final comments before we conclude this committee meeting?",183,,
1536,0.97,8818.776,8818.976,Okay.,183,,
1537,0.97,8818.976,8820.778,"Well, thank you so much.",183,,
1538,0.97,8820.778,8831.656,"So thanks everybody for a very productive, I'll be it long initial committee meeting of the homelessness strategies and neighborhoods committee.",183,,
1539,0.97,8831.656,8834.058,Our next committee meeting is going to be February 26th.,183,,
1540,0.97,8834.058,8856.48,"Like I said earlier, my intention is going to be to possibly set another committee meeting within two weeks, specifically for the purposes of discussing this ordinance to meet a Timeline and make sure that something is proper Hi addressed before the deadline that was discussed during the meeting occurs.",183,,
1541,0.97,8856.48,8859.851,And that is all the business that I have.,183,,
1542,0.97,8859.851,8863.12,"Unless Council member swan, did you have a final comment?",183,,
1543,0.97,8863.12,8871.862,"No, I just something I was going to say Offline, just that my staff will be in touch with you in terms of I'm gone a little bit in the next month.",184,,
1544,0.97,8871.862,8872.964,Oh certainly.,185,,
1545,0.97,8872.964,8878.369,We're going to take care of it while you're gone.,186,,
1546,0.97,8878.369,8880.171,I'm teasing you.,186,,
1547,0.97,8880.171,8881.439,I'm totally kidding.,186,,
1548,0.97,8881.439,8882.64,I'd be happy to --,187,,
1549,0.97,8882.64,8884.609,Thank you so much everybody.,188,,
1550,0.97,8884.976,8885.176,.,188,,
1551,0.97,8885.176,8887.378,Thank you.,189,,
