7,0.97,160.527,166.633,So I moved to adopt the introduction referral calendar is there a second?,2,,
8,0.97,166.633,211.911,"It has been moved and Seconded to adopt the introduction and referral calendar again there are three Councilmembers including myself who have amendments to the introduction and referral calendar I am going to switch the order here a little bit to allow us to consider the perhaps less controversial amendments first and then save the best for last so if there is no objection to that I am going to go ahead and do that, I will start with my amendment to the introduction and referral calendar, if there is no objection item 8 203.4 will be amended by changing the committee referral from the Governance and education committee to the city council.",2,,
9,0.97,211.911,212.912,Second.,3,,

14,0.97,239.539,253.553,"Madam clerk, I am going to call upon you to the author of my script and parliamentarian, it indicates here that I just need to call for an objection, is that correct?",6,,
15,0.97,253.553,266.332,Correct because the amendment is within the unanimous consent that we are seeking and if there are no concessions you would --,7,,

18,0.97,278.344,280.146,Sorry about that.,9,,
19,0.97,280.146,308.508,I think it is largely because of the underlying legislation--okay so this is just an opportunity to have a unanimous consent on this item so if there is no objection item 8 will be amended by changing the committee referral from--to the city council.,9,,
20,0.97,308.508,319.118,Hearing no objection introduction referral calendar is amended to reflect that--is referred to the city council.,9,,
21,0.97,319.118,342.108,"There is also a request for a suspension of rules, Councilmember--I am going to go through the steps needed to suspend the rules and then Councilmember Mosqueda will make a motion that will require a second and then we will go to the rollcall.",9,,

23,0.97,373.973,379.879,Hearing no objection the counsel will be suspended and we will proceed with consideration to the proposed amendment to the introduction and referral calendar.,9,,

30,0.97,483.449,487.787,[roll being called],14,,
31,0.97,503.502,532.231,-- so now we are going to go back to the top of my script here and we will consider Councilmember Pedersen's amendment so I will go ahead and recognize Councilmember Pedersen to make his motion to make the introduction a referral calendar for this afternoon.,15,,
32,0.97,532.231,545.077,As it was circulated last Friday I moved to amend the introduction and referral calendar by introducing --,16,,
33,0.97,558.391,576.542,It has been moved and Seconded by Councilmember Warez to amend the introduction and referral calendar I will hand it back over to Councilmember Pedersen to address this amendment and then we will open it up to comments and questions.,17,,
34,0.97,576.542,597.396,Colleagues have made similar remarks--I should summarize it here for the benefit of the public--circulated an amendment to Council bill 120112.,18,,
35,0.97,597.396,674.24,"That passed out of committee August 17 I am not a member of the committee--and get it approved by the law Department and there are two options to this amendment which I will discuss later--by using the funds--I was not able to get that onto--asking that we add it to the IRC, your vote would not be to support or oppose the authorizing legislation at this time--we do not need to adopt the authorizing legislation right away but I wanted everybody to have it in front of them to read along with--as part of item 3, that is--to effectuate those financial changes--I also want to acknowledge the many who have written with concerns about how we fund our police departments and other programs.",18,,
36,0.97,674.24,707.206,I believe we can and should do more on multiple fronts with--we have the frontline staffing necessary--so I asked my colleagues allow this--thank you.,18,,
37,0.97,707.206,712.411,I see that Councilmember Herbold has her hand raised.,19,,
38,0.97,712.411,717.316,If you would like to make comments you can --,19,,
39,0.97,728.36,772.371,I appreciate Councilmember Pedersen getting this bill in front of us it is in front of us we do not need it on the IRC yet because I still think there is a little bit of a Ripeness issue--to see how this discussion later in today's meeting goes around Councilmember Pedersen's proposed amendment to fund a training and recruitment program and if Councilmember Pedersen is successful with that vote and that amendment we could look at next week's IRC --,20,,
40,0.97,781.013,795.694,Are there any other comments or questions on the introduction --,21,,
41,0.97,795.694,796.328,--,22,,
42,0.97,867.066,939.305,"Thank you, I will be voting no on this amendment but I want to be clear my objection is not about process, it is about the content of the bill, my office is totally opposed to the content of the bill, and as has been Referenced earlier, there will be amendments--and I will be speaking to the substance of my opposition to those amendments which will be similar arguments in opposition to this bill so I will not--ordinarily I virtually never have process arguments against discussion, I believe in the broadest possible Democratic discussion available and--consistent with that I will be voting no on this motion.",23,,
43,0.97,939.305,990.889,"For those Councilmembers who may not be tracking this closely, I know that I just had a conversation with my staff about some of the staging issues, I will describe them as, that Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Mosqueda have highlighted, to put it simply, my understanding is that if some or all of Councilmember Pedersen's amendments to the bill as passed out of committee are successful, then that Obviates the need for us to consider the legislation that he is seeking to place on the introduction and referral calendar.",24,,
44,0.97,990.889,1029.695,"If those amendments fail, it would require consideration of the Council bill that he is seeking to add to the introduction and referral calendar, so I think some of the arguments that are being made right now is let's see how the amendments fair one way or another before we agree to add a Council bill related to those subject matters to the introduction and referral calendar.",24,,
45,0.97,1029.695,1042.508,So for those of you who may not be following that process and procedure that is effectively what the conversation is right now as it relates to this procedural issue related to whether or not we should amend the introduction and referral calendar.,24,,
46,0.97,1042.508,1086.885,"Now that the motion has been made and Seconded, and I am not sure if Councilmember Pedersen is, let me Rephrase that, it is unclear to me now that we are discussing the introduction and referral calendar and that the motions and seconds have been made as it has been amended my understanding based on the city council rules is that we now have to vote on this particular motion that is before us since it is on the table but I will call on our city clerk to either confirm or clarify the city council rules related to that procedure.",24,,
47,0.97,1086.885,1118.617,"There are a couple of options that can occur, a motion can be held after consideration the bill itself on agenda item 2 and 3 if I am not mistaken and the motion can be withdrawn completely and the IRC can be--and the Council can decide at this point--or not.",25,,
48,0.97,1118.617,1131.263,"And Madame clerk if we were to call this matter to a vote now, would we be able to reconsider the introduction and referral calendar later on in the agenda?",26,,
49,0.97,1131.263,1133.298,You could.,27,,
50,0.97,1133.298,1136.535,Thank you so much.,28,,
51,0.97,1136.535,1139.404,I think we are as clear as mud now as they say.,28,,
52,0.97,1139.404,1166.198,So Councilmember Pedersen my Subjection suggestion is that we go ahead and call this to a vote and see how the voting on--goes and after that consideration if you wish to Re- introduce or have us reconsider--that is certainly a motion that you would be entitled to make.,28,,
53,0.97,1166.198,1168.834,Thank you.,29,,
54,0.97,1168.834,1194.393,Are there any additional comments or questions on Councilmembers Peterson's--Councilmember Pedersen's motion to amend--hearing none --,30,,
55,0.97,1194.393,1229.328,"[roll being called] three in favor, six opposed.",31,,
56,0.97,1229.328,1237.703,"The motion fails, and the bill is not introduced.",32,,
57,0.97,1237.703,1256.555,"Again, depending on how the conversation goes--there is an opportunity--are there any further comments on the introduction and referral calendar?",32,,
58,0.97,1256.555,1268.967,"All right, hearing no additional comments on the introduction and referral calendar, will the clerk please call the role on the adoption of the introduction and referral calendar as amended?",32,,
59,0.97,1268.967,1292.758,"[roll being called] nine in favor, none opposed.",33,,
60,0.97,1292.758,1295.594,The motion carries and the introduction and referral calendar is adopted as amended.,34,,
61,0.97,1295.594,1305.37,Approval of the agenda I moved to adopt the agenda is there a second?,34,,
62,0.97,1305.37,1305.704,Second.,35,,
63,0.97,1305.704,1315.28,It has been moved and Seconded by Councilmember Herbold to adopt the agenda are there any comments on the agenda and I noticed that Councilmember Mosqueda has one amendment here so I will call on Councilmember Mosqueda to make her amendment.,36,,
64,0.97,1315.28,1335.701,"Thank you very much Madame President, I moved to amend the agenda on item number 1 which is Council bill 120119 and I hope to hold this bill indefinitely, I will talk more about why if there is a second.",37,,
65,0.97,1335.701,1351.616,It has been moved and Seconded that Council bill 120119 be held indefinitely.,38,,
66,0.97,1354.319,1361.827,The bill that we had in front of us on today's agenda was actually an amendment to legislation that we had passed earlier this year providing for dollar hazard pay for grocery workers.,39,,
67,0.97,1361.827,1464.763,"The legislation also--as you will recall the committee past the amendment earlier this summer when Covid-19 and vaccination rates were at a very different place than they are now, our committee had considered--as a narrow amendment to the original legislation that we passed, we have continued to move to delay the amendment to this requirement in full counsel because we wanted to make sure that we were looking at the most recent public health data and we wanted to do this during full counsel so that--I am still--and of course I am always interested in making sure that we are strengthening labor protection, but this bill was narrow, it is not what overall worker pay was about, today's motion to delay the vote indefinitely moves this amendment into a longer period so that we have more time to consider additional public health information and make sure that we are looking at how to address--the information that we have right now signals to me that this is not the time to lift the hazard pay requirements.",39,,
68,0.97,1464.763,1472.537,We have learned from public health over the last few weeks about the increased rates of hospitalizations in this region and across the country.,39,,
69,0.97,1472.537,1484.683,I want to thank--who have continued to share with us the news on Vaccinations and hospitalizations.,39,,
70,0.97,1484.683,1498.897,"We continue to see the number of cases increasing, and we will soon be able to see the impacts of the new vaccine requirement which we are very hopeful will help to decrease the number of hospitalizations.",39,,
71,0.97,1498.897,1513.345,To give you a sense of scale on August 3 just a month ago the caseload was 344 people with several area hospitals reporting shortages and--over 95%.,39,,
72,0.97,1513.345,1532.197,We have the new mandatory indoor and in some cases outdoor mask requirements we are very hopeful that if folks continue to follow these mask requirements especially for exposure to grocery store workers that we continue to see decreases in transmission.,39,,
73,0.97,1532.197,1552.15,We need to make sure that we are addressing transmission and hospitalization rates before--I believe that this is the right thing to do to delay this bill indefinitely and then we will take it up again once we continue to look at public health data to make sure that E are moving Forwar moment where we have greater stability in our region.,39,,
74,0.97,1552.15,1554.519,Thank you Madame President.,39,,
75,0.97,1554.519,1564.663,Thank you so much are there any additional comments on--Council bill 120119 indefinitely?,40,,
76,0.97,1564.663,1565.297,"Councilmember Pedersen, please.",40,,
77,0.97,1565.297,1623.021,"Thank you, I know we have had this come back a couple of times so I appreciate your willingness to put it on the agenda for us to discuss, and those grocers who may be concerned about the hazard pay to know that just because the motion is to hold it indefinitely does not mean that it will not come back, it is just that it is not practical to have it come back every 2 or 3 weeks when we are in the midst of the Delta variant crisis and there are so many unknowns from a public health standpoint, so we do know that, I am hearing the concerns from grocers, I also support what the workers are going through, and so this will be brought back eventually, it is just that it makes no sense for it to come back in two weeks.",41,,
78,0.97,1623.021,1628.727,"I wanted to clarify that for the folks here and the official motion is indefinite, but it will come back.",41,,
79,0.97,1628.727,1629.327,Councilmember Herbold.,42,,
80,0.97,1629.327,1678.476,"I also want to thank Councilmember Mosqueda for--that require this to expire after the end of six months after the state of emergency, but I really appreciate the recognition that having some consistency around our Covid-19 response, that the city is leading on for workers, for tenants, and for workers and landlords is useful for the discussion around--thank you.",43,,
81,0.97,1678.476,1683.348,Councilmember Morales.,44,,
82,0.97,1683.348,1700.799,"I think I did that accidentally, but since I have the floor, sorry, I think this really just points to the fact that when we created the state of emergency, we had no idea what we were getting into.",45,,
83,0.97,1700.799,1705.703,Or the state that we would be in.,45,,
84,0.97,1705.703,1713.011,I read over the weekend that some of the medical professionals are thinking that we might be in this situation for another 2 or 3 years.,45,,
85,0.97,1713.011,1746.111,"I think it might be time for us to just start thinking about not Covid-19 as a state of emergency but a state of things for us, and I do not know what that means necessarily in terms of how we change the language, but it is just making me realize that we are going to be here for a while and perhaps the state of emergency is not quite the right way to deal with it, so I just wanted to put it on the table.",45,,
86,0.97,1746.111,1748.146,Thank you.,46,,
87,0.97,1748.146,1749.114,Councilmember Sawant.,46,,
88,0.97,1749.114,1874.272,"Thank you, I think it is important to at the very least hold this indefinitely, so I will be voting yes on this, but I also wanted to clarify to members of the public and working people and activists who are watching this that as I said before, I would not want to support the arguments to remove the hazard pay in the first place, I do not agree with Councilmember Pedersen presenting the false arguments of the grocery corporations as equivalent to the problems faced by the grocery workers and the sacrifices they have made especially during the pandemic, but overall the fact that workers under capitalism are paid a fraction of the value of their labor and also keeping in mind that of course right now they are facing the continued threat of the Delta variant and the number of cases going up, all of that is still there and it is extremely important to know, and in addition to that it is important to know that the effects of the pandemic, the economic, financial, and other effects of the pandemic are going to be faced by the workers for many years to come, let's not forget that there is billions of dollars of rental debt that has been accumulated by workers, many of them Unfortunately we are at this point where many of them are actually Union workers, of course Nonunion workers are in a worse situation but there are many Union workers who are not able to keep up with the housing crisis simply because the rents are skyrocketing at such a rate--keeping up with the kind of rent increases that people are facing not just in Seattle but nationwide.",47,,
89,0.97,1874.272,1944.108,"So I believe that whatever workers have been able to win in the example of hazard pay in this case--I would not be in a position to vote to remove that pay at any time whether it is now or a year from now, and in fact I would urge workers who are watching this to make sure that they build on whatever little that they won during the pandemic in order to ensure that all workers have a living wage whether it is a pandemic or not--I think it is crucial that we do not draw false equivalence between corporations, corporate executives, Multimillionaires and Billionaires on one hand and ordinary people and workers on the other, let's not forget that the latest statistics show that since the pandemic began, Billionaires in the United States have become nearly $2 trillion red wealthier than they were before.",47,,
90,0.97,1944.108,1947.812,Thank you.,47,,
91,0.97,1947.812,1954.218,Are there any additional comments on this motion to hold?,48,,
92,0.97,1954.218,1962.86,"Councilmember Mosqueda if you could closeout debate, I do want to acknowledge it is to: 33 P.M.",48,,
93,0.97,1962.86,1970.568,"And we are still on procedural matters so if we could speeded up that would be great, because we do have almost 60 people waiting to address the Council.",48,,
94,0.97,1970.568,1985.983,I did not hear a false equivalency being made and--appreciate your consideration --,49,,
95,0.97,1985.983,1992.69,Will the clerk please call the roll to hold it indefinitely Council bill 120119?,50,,
96,0.97,1992.69,2013.01,"[roll being called] 90 in favor, none opposed.",51,,
97,0.97,2013.01,2015.079,The motion carries and the bill is held indefinitely.,52,,
98,0.97,2015.079,2027.425,"I am not aware of any other amendments to the agenda, so are there any further comments on the amended agenda before we call it a rollcall?",52,,

103,0.97,2065.83,2135.099,I want to thank everyone for their ongoing patience and cooperation as we continue to--it does remain our strong intent to continue having remote public comment included on our many Agendas but the city council reserves the right to--[Indiscernible--low volume] I will moderate the public comment period in the following manner the public comment period was originally noted to be a total of 20 minutes with each Speaker given 2 minutes to speak however we do have a large volume of people signed up to provide us with public comment primarily on the budget ordinance related to the Seattle police Department and--so given the importance of that issue and the fact that many of these amendments not all of them were made available to the public very late and have not gone through the committee--process I am going to allow everyone who signed up to speak today but I will reduce the time from 2 minutes to a total of one minute.,54,,

368,0.97,6274.368,6309.803,As we were on the cusp of passing the supplemental budget we did get word from the Mayor's office and--and so what we did was with the support of the colleagues on the committee was work to bring forward an amendment that included many strategies to address public safety and to couple those public safety investments with community efforts to scale up alternatives to our traditional police response by making sure we had investments directly into community.,167,,
369,0.97,6309.803,6401.762,"I think of the package in front of us including the amendment that we worked on was an important balance of investing and community services, civil service positions,--represents an effort to ensure that we are meeting counsel and executive priorities and--and moving forward with things like making sure that the mental health providers are available for frontline responders or making sure that we are Pairing paying for paid parental leave and--recognizing that overtime is probably larger than what was needed given that we are dealing with Covid-19 and making sure that we have invested in King County regional Peacekeepers and the funding that was needed to make sure that our community has the funding that they need to respond to these crises, and I am most excited to highlight the $3 million that we have included in this proposal as well to invest in the human services Department--that are needed to provide the stability so that there is truly a landing zone or landing place as the fire fighters have talked about so that--not just 18 months but for two years, and we have received support that it is really important to have stability for the community partners so that when 911 is called they have someone to refer those calls to.",167,,

371,0.97,6446.973,6486.279,"We do have several amendments, my suggestion consistent with how we usually structure these conversations is to go through the amendments and before opening up debate on the substance of the bill, if there is no objection I would like to go ahead and proceed in that manner so consideration of amendments first, debate on amendments and we can make closing wrap up comments on the bill as amended, is there any objection?",168,,

390,0.97,6774.067,6795.188,"The motion carries the amendment is adopted and the amended bill is before the Council, so we will move now to amendment three a, and I will move it over to Councilmember Pedersen to make his motion.",179,,
391,0.97,6795.188,6803.963,"Just for context there are two options here, but I will read the first option, I moved to amend Council bill 120112 as represented as amendment 3A on today's agenda.",180,,
392,0.97,6803.963,6816.142,It has been moved and Seconded to amend--I will send it back over to Councilmember Pedersen to walk us through his amendment.,181,,
393,0.97,6816.142,6841.501,"This would allocate funds that are already in SPD's allocated budget--there are two options for the amendment, option a, we keep $3 million--option B would take an Unallocated $1.1 million and dedicate it for recruitment and retention.",182,,
394,0.97,6841.501,6848.841,"This first amendment is on option one, the larger amount.",182,,
395,0.97,6848.841,6857.55,I think it should be viewed in the bigger picture of the substantial investments and actions we have taken and will continue to take to boost human services programs and Reimagine public safety.,182,,
396,0.97,6857.55,6911.604,As we await various alternatives to put in place we must also recognize the title wave in attrition--the benefits of having community policing officers and detectives and as noted by the--the need to have consistent staffing--we also have an obligation in the city charter--I also want to acknowledge--I also hear you.,182,,
397,0.97,6911.604,6921.714,It is Importat to note that these funds were already funded to SPD's--so labeling the proposals as a refunding I do not think is accurate.,182,,
398,0.97,6921.714,6932.725,It would however focus some of those options for recruitment and retention.,182,,
399,0.97,6932.725,6946.739,-- funded all through next year 2022 and we have plenty of opportunities to extend and expand--we are in the middle of an SPD staffing crisis now.,182,,
400,0.97,6946.739,6963.156,"Specifically option a would keep the $3 million in SPD with $233,000 for hiring incentives during the last three months of this year plus the remainder, the $2.7 million as an immediate down payment for flexible retention strategies which could include--but does not have to.",182,,
401,0.97,6963.156,6967.66,If authorized by a separate bill that I introduced earlier.,182,,
402,0.97,6967.66,6994.12,These modest amounts would go beyond mere words to demonstrate that we recognize the impact of the staffing crisis and that we want our remaining officers and detectives to stay in Seattle so rather than delaying until the end of November to vote on this for next year's budget we can take this Swifter action this week to reduce the amount of time Seattle residents wait for an officer after calling 911 thank you.,182,,
403,0.97,7005.798,7013.906,"-- I have three folks in the Queue, first up is Councilmember Herbold, then Councilmember Lewis, then Councilmember Sawant.",183,,
404,0.97,7013.906,7036.295,"I totally agree that hiring and retention is a really important issue, and I agree with it in not just words but in action, the legislation before us as amended by the Finance and budget committee and without Councilmember Pedersen's amendment--by funding hiring process accelerators.",184,,
405,0.97,7036.295,7048.708,The topic merits additional attention and I believe it merits additional attention through the annual budget process which begins in a couple weeks.,184,,
406,0.97,7048.708,7079.072,"I believe this because I want to look at the vacancy rate of all city departments and look at this question of how we Incentivize folks taking these good family wage jobs across all the departments that are experiencing vacancies right now, central staff has determined that the executive has documented staffing shortages and accompanying service delivery issues in a few different departments.",184,,
407,0.97,7079.072,7099.492,It is well-known that the impacts of Covid-19 on employment has been unprecedented both for the private sector as well as the public sector with people leaving their jobs and with sustained vacancies across most employment sectors as well.,184,,
408,0.97,7099.492,7113.506,If we need to discuss recruitment I think we need to consider vacancies across all city departments and whether we need to consider hiring bonuses and--for other departments as well.,184,,
409,0.97,7113.506,7140.132,"So I would support considering--the proposal from Councilmember Pedersen would authorize up to $15,000 per SPD hire, if we are considering hiring bonuses--if we are allowing for one particular Department up to $15,000 per higher.",184,,
410,0.97,7140.132,7188.18,Just as a little bit of background on this topic generally back in July I request that SPD send a memo TOS within the Seattle police Department budget in the salary savings category that SPD would not be able to spend unless we authorize reallocation of those funds . in that memo the police Department requested funding for hiring bonuses including as I mentioned before the accelerators . There was no broader request at the time for funding and retention.,184,,
411,0.97,7188.18,7190.917,These are my comments as it relates to the tension piece.,184,,
412,0.97,7190.917,7207.3,"Councilmember Pedersen's proposal, I just want to highlight that as it relates specifically to retention as I mentioned during budget, or during briefings this morning.",184,,
413,0.97,7207.3,7227.019,I really want to focus on the recommendations of a 2019 hiring and retention report that called for wellness schedules . These are 4 10-hour shifts that would provide officers three consecutive days of rest rather than just two.,184,,
414,0.97,7227.019,7252.144,"This has been the highest rated priority for officers and I am concerned that although the amendment includes specific language, $230,000 for the hiring bonus, the description by the sponsor expresses vague intent.",184,,
415,0.97,7252.144,7271.864,"Because $3000 is very specific for hiring bonuses and the larger amount of the funds isn't specified for any particular use, that would mean it would likely need to be Reauthorized in any event.",184,,
416,0.97,7271.864,7290.783,"Again, the budget package got to the Finance and housing committee and includes technology upgrades that will support officer wellness and supervision, $120,000 that was included.",184,,
417,0.97,7290.783,7308.067,I want to note that many Front- line workers have received appreciation pay for their service during the pandemic and I am supportive of continuing discussions on how best to authorize appreciation pay for police officers.,184,,
418,0.97,7308.067,7322.214,I am grateful for the work of Seattle police Department and the officers that have not left SPD and remain committed to community safety and specifically to community safety in Seattle.,184,,
419,0.97,7322.214,7324.216,Thank you.,184,,
420,0.97,7324.216,7331.924,Thank you Councilmember Gerbert . Councilmember Lewis?,185,,
421,0.97,7331.924,7334.894,Thank you.,186,,
422,0.97,7334.894,7345.638,"I will say at the top I will not be voting for this amendment, but I want to expand on the reasons why . I appreciate the opportunity for this debate.",186,,
423,0.97,7345.638,7376.268,"That is why this Council is here to address issues . I agree with the sponsor of the amendment and with chair Herbold and her comments just now that we do have a police crisis . I think a lot of us on the Council agree broadly with that, which is why we fully funded a police hiring class for 2021 and is often not mentioned in the media or the stories about police hiring that the Council did find a hiring class.",186,,
424,0.97,7376.268,7393.352,I don't disagree that a partial strategy to mitigate this crisis can be through the hiring and retention incentives that are being offered today by Councilmember Pedersen . What I disagree with is the Re- Prioritization of the money component of this amendment.,186,,
425,0.97,7393.352,7395.788,Money earmarked for critical crime prevention programs in the human services Department.,186,,
426,0.97,7395.788,7409.101,I just want to take a moment to discourse a little more broadly about the public safety crisis in the city and how alternate investments are needed and how they can make an impact.,186,,
427,0.97,7409.101,7416.008,I want to focus particularly because it has been a big crisis in my district and I know it has across many other districts.,186,,
428,0.97,7416.008,7422.414,It has touched every district in the city throughout this year.,186,,
429,0.97,7422.414,7434.393,"I want to start by strongly acknowledging the critical role that the police play in responding to and preventing that violence . As of August 31st, Seattle police have recovered 700 guns this year taken off the street.",186,,
430,0.97,7434.393,7437.83,They physically removed 700 guns and secured them.,186,,
431,0.97,7437.83,7448.207,Seattle police continue to have serving extreme risk protection orders to seize firearms from folks who pose a safety risk to themselves or others.,186,,
432,0.97,7448.207,7461.62,"These efforts Undoubtably prevent gun violence in our community, save lives, and make the community safer.",186,,
433,0.97,7461.62,7468.928,There are limits to what police alone can achieve and we need to keep leaning into the investments this Council has advocated for . they can have a Pofound impact on gun violence perfection.,186,,
434,0.97,7468.928,7484.276,I think this becomes more evident when we look at the data on the shootings we are seeing and experiencing in Seattle this year to really determine what can we do to intervene and prevent these shootings before they occur that are having such a horrible impact on our community.,186,,
435,0.97,7484.276,7491.684,"This last Friday, I listened to Krystal Nicole Fincher's Podcast.",186,,
436,0.97,7491.684,7500.059,"I highly recommend it . If folks haven't listened, I recommend you give it a shot.",186,,
437,0.97,7500.059,7501.093,It's great.,186,,
438,0.97,7501.093,7513.205,Crystal and the former Mayor had a great conversation about the current discourse our city has had around gun violence.,186,,
439,0.97,7513.205,7531.891,"They noted--and I can't say I disagree from their discussion, but there has been a lack of critical analysis by many in the media to Delve into our increase in shootings and what the data is indicating so we can have a real response as a community on what we are going to do to deal with this epidemic of gun violence that is crippling our city and killing people in our community.",186,,
440,0.97,7531.891,7538.597,We need to see who are the victims?,186,,
441,0.97,7538.597,7539.632,Who is doing the shooting?,186,,
442,0.97,7539.632,7549.208,We need to look Holistically at how we can respond . I want to briefly illustrate by sharing a little bit of analysis I did because I was curious on getting the data from the police Department.,186,,
443,0.97,7549.208,7558.35,"Overwhelmingly in 2021, our neighbors experiencing homelessness have vastly and disproportionately been the victims of the increase in gun crime.",186,,
444,0.97,7558.35,7565.024,"According to data, it was provided to me by the police Department on September 1ST.",186,,
445,0.97,7565.024,7566.625,It has been over a week ago.,186,,
446,0.97,7566.625,7576.769,We have had 64 shots fired incidents . that is up 120% from 2020.,186,,
447,0.97,7576.769,7580.239,That is a huge part of the increase in gun violence we are seeing on the street.,186,,
448,0.97,7580.239,7599.959,"It is nearly one-fifth of all of the shootings that have occurred in 2020. tragically I have no doubt ever the last 12 days after I got the data that that data is probably out of date . in almost all of these cases, the victim of the shooting is a neighbor experiencing homelessness.",186,,
449,0.97,7599.959,7608.067,In most cases the shooting occurs in an Unsanctioned encampment setting . I raise this because police alone can't prevent these shootings.,186,,
450,0.97,7608.067,7620.212,"I have incredible gratitude for the officers that have been responding to these Encampments and responding to the shootings and in many cases Apprehending a suspect, recovering guns and getting them off the street.",186,,
451,0.97,7620.212,7657.249,"I appreciate that response and I know it makes the community safer . until people are provided with desirable alternative places to live with Wraparound services, all we're doing is responding to Encampments that are providing in many cases a Hub of continued nonviolent . We are not Proactively solving the underlying problems . We are frankly putting more work and exposure on our officers to continue to respond in many cases to very dangerous situations by not solving for these underlying causes.",186,,
452,0.97,7657.249,7668.761,"I know I am a broken record and I know I have agreement from my colleagues nearly unanimously, but just care has undeniably prevented shootings that would have occurred, but for their intervention.",186,,
453,0.97,7668.761,7688.614,They offer highly desirable well supported hotel room shelter spaces which are overwhelmingly inspected by community members and by our neighbors experiencing homelessness . The University of Washington study showed a 38% reduction in 911 call volume after their outreach operations.,186,,
454,0.97,7688.614,7714.707,"I have no doubt that the Justcare outreach at the former encampment downtown, at the second Avenue at Pioneer square prevented shootings from occurring that would have otherwise occurred . There is a clear correlation between having thousands of residents exposed to the elements and their tragic likelihood of being a victim of gun violence.",186,,
455,0.97,7714.707,7739.498,"Bringing it back to the amendment, I think it is critical that we center these human services investments as a large portion of these salary savings to invest in these Proactive community safety strategies . We need to look no further than the mentor ship and community building effort for Passageways to know that is true and that is possible.",186,,
456,0.97,7739.498,7745.604,Known Gang-Related shootings this year have actually decreased in 2021.,186,,
457,0.97,7745.604,7748.474,"The city, the Council, and the Mayor working together had expanded these support programs.",186,,
458,0.97,7748.474,7765.023,"They are building strong communities . These innovative community programs can get to scale . they can get us resources to build strong, supportive, and safe communities.",186,,
459,0.97,7765.023,7769.261,We should not be Pitting investments against each other and I stand by dedicating this money to the human services Department.,186,,
460,0.97,7769.261,7771.363,"For that reason, I will vote against this amendment.",186,,
461,0.97,7771.363,7774.967,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis for the comments.",187,,

464,0.97,7780.739,7792.084,"I will be voting against this amendment Needless to say . for members of public that are listening, this should be a clear illustration of the importance of the movement.",188,,
465,0.97,7792.084,7841.233,"At the height of the justice for George Floyd movement, the majority of the council voted to Defund the police by 50% and instead to put those funds into social needs . Now that the street movement has waned every marginal victory that the movement won last year is under attack . We saw earlier this year how the majority of the city council drove new polls into the historic ban on the movement we won through the efforts of hundreds of activists and on my Council office . This is why our movement cannot trust the political establishment and why we must build our own political power outside the Republican and Democratic parties . a party for working people.",188,,
466,0.97,7841.233,7855.447,"Keep in mind here in Seattle every Council member except for my office is a Democrat . This is why I am a Socialist . on this issue, first let's be clear about the double standard we are talking about.",188,,
467,0.97,7855.447,7866.658,"Councilmembers, like Pedersen, advocate for hiring bonuses in the police Department but frankly it is not just Councilmember Pedersen that has talked about this today or in the past.",188,,
468,0.97,7866.658,7895.487,"The police are some of the highest paid people among city of Seattle employees, making more than double what is paid to many social workers like homeless service workers . The Mayor has claimed she cannot use the funding for shelter and tiny House villages . The people's budget movement and other activists wanted this in the last budget because there are not enough homeless service workers to staff new spaces.",188,,
469,0.97,7895.487,7903.795,Hiring bonuses are just a raise for the impoverished homeless service workers that actually help people turn their lives around.,188,,
470,0.97,7903.795,7923.115,I have heard Councilmembers and would ask them have they looked at the turnover among social workers and how low their pay is compared to the services they provide? it should not be a surprise there is low morale among police officers.,188,,
471,0.97,7923.115,7934.459,"We saw the murder of George Floyd . We saw police filling the communities with tear gas, pepper spring children in the face, running over protesters with bicycles.",188,,
472,0.97,7934.459,7946.004,"All of that is in addition to the usual level of violence from the police to communities of color, working-class communities, and for people especially like our homeless neighbors.",188,,
473,0.97,7946.004,7952.11,We should of course NOTE the police do this with the consent of the political establishment.,188,,
474,0.97,7952.11,7974.933,Of course there is low morale among police officers when so many ordinary people have open their eyes and are totally outraged I the harm the police do . The solution is not to pretend those problems and the justifiable outrage doesn't exist . The solution is to hold police accountable for the violence they do and to find the needs of the community.,188,,
475,0.97,7974.933,7994.82,"I do not support hiring bonuses for police . the highest paid people in the city . I do not support this amendment, which Would/Funds to the community programs . remember, the amount of police funding does not have any statistical impact on the amount of crime in a community.",188,,
476,0.97,7994.82,8006.998,It is inequality that has the greatest statistical impact . I absolutely share the concerns that ordinary people have about the rise in gun violence . I have that concern as well.,188,,
477,0.97,8006.998,8018.11,"There is no question that we need to address this, but if you look at this statistically, you would see this is happening even though the police budget has been loaded for many years.",188,,
478,0.97,8018.11,8044.002,"You know, that demand was never fulfilled . If you look at the data, the police budget has been for many years while affordable housing and working people in the communities and the poor need this and continue to be greatly underfunded . They are underfunded at the state level and at the Federal level also.",188,,
479,0.97,8044.002,8060.752,"At the same time, we are seeing rent skyrocket, even in the midst of the pandemic . studies show that the best and only solution to public safety issues is to fund the needs of our society, to address crime and stop crimes before they even happen.",188,,
480,0.97,8060.752,8071.163,"We need to find affordable social housing expansion, like we did with the Amazon tax.",188,,

482,0.97,8073.265,8074.699,We need to raise wages even further.,188,,
483,0.97,8074.699,8076.668,We need to have rent control and Renters rights.,188,,

518,0.97,8253.812,8264.356,"It would be the same amount for recruitment, 433,000. for the last three months of this year.",215,,
519,0.97,8264.356,8268.36,A remaining amount as a down payment toward efforts to retain existing officers and detectives.,215,,
520,0.97,8268.36,8271.263,Thank you.,215,,
521,0.97,8271.263,8272.263,Thank you so much.,216,,
522,0.97,8272.263,8277.168,I do see a couple people with their hands raised.,216,,
523,0.97,8277.168,8278.97,I will go ahead and start calling on folks.,216,,
524,0.97,8278.97,8281.64,Councilmember Herbold is up first.,216,,
525,0.97,8281.64,8284.075,Thank you.,217,,
526,0.97,8284.075,8305.397,"All of my comments that I have made about recruitment and retention strategies and my belief that in addition to the funding in this legislation for recruitment and retention strategies, which again, there is some funding in this bill dedicated to those purposes.",217,,
527,0.97,8305.397,8315.974,All of my comments about the funding objectives that I made in the previous amendment still stand for this.,217,,
528,0.97,8315.974,8354.145,"I want to just say very quickly, the proposal and impacts of proposal . As I understand it and from the simple staff memo this amendment is passed and its salary savings are consistent . SPD would not have remaining salary savings to spend on some items that the Council has identified as a priority and included support.",217,,
529,0.97,8354.145,8362.854,"It would not include support for it in this bill, but they have been identified by SPD as high priority.",217,,
530,0.97,8362.854,8389.881,"One of those is funding for a new CSO squad at the rate of $120,000 for 2021. potential Covid related compensation, $0.5 million . The identification of $3 million to fund overtime cost.",217,,
531,0.97,8389.881,8418.109,We did this with $1.5 million of the requested $3 million over time and that is authorized in Council bill 1201 12 as amended . We specifically Referenced the $1.5 million in the bill came out of committee as potential sources for these other High-Priority ones from the police Department.,217,,
532,0.97,8418.109,8446.171,"If we vote in favor of this second option, we are pretty close to zeroing out SPD's budget . We can't look at funding--or SPD cannot look at funding for the other priorities . In particular as it relates to overtime, I am glad we kind of held the line at adding $1.5 million to overtime in the bill before us.",217,,
533,0.97,8446.171,8542.4,"I just want to signal that my understanding that as it relates to specific Trending priorities and specifically use of force training, De- escalation training, crisis response training as well as particular reviews that the police Department has to do, their intervention, reviews, review board reviews, these reviews are required for SPD to do in advance of an OPA investigation . When there is an OPA investigation with use of force, they have a big backlog on doing these reviews, which then affects the investigations . Finally supervision ratios and Sergeant to officer ratios, we think of overtime as, you know, overtime for emphasis patrol or overtime for protest response . This is a really critical use of overtime particularly when the Department doesn't have a lot of vacancies . They rely more on overtime so officers can be paid to, again, complete their training.",217,,
534,0.97,8542.4,8562.62,"These reviews, the FRB reviews as well as the supervision ratios . for this reason, I apologize but I cannot support the amendment . modify the amendment with a different source of funds . Thank you.",217,,
535,0.97,8562.62,8566.157,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Herbold.",218,,
536,0.97,8566.157,8568.259,"Councilmember Lewis, your next.",218,,
537,0.97,8568.259,8571.863,Then Councilmember Sawant.,218,,
538,0.97,8571.863,8573.331,"Thank you, Madam President.",219,,
539,0.97,8573.331,8583.074,"While I opposed Councilmember Pedersen's amendment a, I want to expand on some of the reasons why.",219,,
540,0.97,8583.074,8596.254,As I said before I agreed that the police staffing crisis is real and I agree we need to transition to a right -Sized first response where police are one of several services that can be dispatched.,219,,
541,0.97,8596.254,8610.702,We have a report now from the National Institute of criminal justice reform by SPD and funded by the Council indicating that 75% of calls for service could ultimately be handled by civilian response.,219,,
542,0.97,8610.702,8622.28,We know that number is contested by the Department but there is a consensus on the sizable percentage . We know some of those services are being stood up.,219,,
543,0.97,8622.28,8626.718,Those services have not been completely built nor scaled.,219,,
544,0.97,8626.718,8644.869,"The Council has taken those initial steps by building an independent dispatch service, which is critical and essential . We have extended the Healthone program . We are in the process of developing triage one, which would take on a large range for calls for service.",219,,
545,0.97,8644.869,8656.614,"My hope is that triage one would be near Eugene, Oregon or something close to those low Acuity response programs . This is still in the future.",219,,
546,0.97,8656.614,8657.615,It is still being discussed.,219,,
547,0.97,8657.615,8666.157,We don't completely know what role those programs will fill let alone when they will be at scale to take calls for service.,219,,
548,0.97,8666.157,8682.974,I firmly believe based on analyzing the whole national situation on policing and public safety that the American cities in the future are going to be the cities that engage in this diversification of response services.,219,,
549,0.97,8682.974,8705.963,"Not only for the benefit to health and wellness of getting a better tailored first response for calls for service, but because responding to historic levels for police to continue to fill the same Footprint police have always filled in the United States is not going to be Logistically possible.",219,,
550,0.97,8705.963,8707.298,Police hiring is down 5% nationally.,219,,
551,0.97,8707.298,8716.708,Resignations from police services have risen 18% and retirement have risen 45% . It is a crisis that is not unique to Seattle.,219,,
552,0.97,8716.708,8724.615,New York City alone lost 5346 police officers in 2020 . 75% increase in the rate.,219,,
553,0.97,8724.615,8734.525,Such large attrition prior to the establishment and scale of alternative services greatly hampers our ability as a city to provide first response.,219,,
554,0.97,8734.525,8744.936,"The only service that is to scale that can fill the role of that first response is of our deliberation right now today, the police Department.",219,,
555,0.97,8744.936,8767.258,I didn't support amendment a because the only way we will realize the future vision that all of us on the Council share is going to be continuing to make steady and consistent investments in the human services Department to develop--and other departments--to develop and create these services.,219,,
556,0.97,8767.258,8780.872,"Continue to have those programs evaluated and scaled and take on bigger duties . until that time, we need a viable police Department capable of responding to calls for service.",219,,
557,0.97,8780.872,8799.19,"For that reason, I am voting in favor of taking a currently undedicated portion of salary savings for hiring and retention services and strategies and will vote in favor of the amendment today.",219,,
558,0.97,8799.19,8800.992,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Lewis.",220,,
559,0.97,8800.992,8806.097,"Councilmember Sawant, you are next in line.",220,,
560,0.97,8806.097,8809.2,I would like to repeat what I said for the previous vote.,221,,
561,0.97,8809.2,8812.069,This has all of the same problems.,221,,
562,0.97,8812.069,8813.971,I do not support increasing policing.,221,,
563,0.97,8813.971,8817.475,We should instead invest in equality.,221,,
564,0.97,8817.475,8833.224,"One year ago Councilmembers would say they would not Defund the police as promised because it would require several months to lay off officers, police officers . They said don't worry, they would do so in 2021.",221,,
565,0.97,8833.224,8844.769,"Then in 2021 rather than cutting the budget, they had Provisos to study out of order layoffs.",221,,
566,0.97,8844.769,8849.006,This budget will end those Provisos and they are talking about hiring bonuses to increase the size of the police force.,221,,
567,0.97,8849.006,8867.859,The thing that changed is the movement in 2020 where we had thousands on the street in Seattle protesting police violence . I do not support Reinstituting hiring bonuses for the police . I will be voting no on this amendment.,221,,
568,0.97,8867.859,8878.569,"To members of the public, I have an amendment from my office to actually put some of the money into the supporting communities funding the human services Department.",221,,
569,0.97,8878.569,8884.475,Thank you.,221,,
570,0.97,8884.475,8897.688,"Thanks so much, Councilmember Sawant . are there additional comments on amendment 3B? Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",222,,
571,0.97,8897.688,8898.889,"Thank you, Council President.",223,,
572,0.97,8898.889,8904.528,I too wanted to give you my rationale for voting no on this amendment.,223,,
573,0.97,8904.528,8907.164,I want to start with reminding ourselves about what is in this amendment.,223,,
574,0.97,8907.164,8922.513,What is and is amendment largely Refax conversations we have had with the community with members of the Mayor's office about ideas to make sure we are addressing some of the pressing stressors that we see in SPD.,223,,
575,0.97,8922.513,8935.326,"That includes making sure there is full funding as requested for the mental health provider, full funding for paid parental leave . more and more people are taking parental leave and sick leave because of the pandemic, which is something we want them to be doing.",223,,
576,0.97,8935.326,8947.104,This includes the $1.047 million to make sure there are additional people who can respond to crises so it doesn't have to be an armed officer with a badge.,223,,
577,0.97,8947.104,8957.448,It includes $0.5 million focused on addressing gun violence in King County.,223,,
578,0.97,8957.448,8958.95,That is a proven public health strategy.,223,,
579,0.97,8958.95,8991.182,"Again, as requested to help relieve officers with a gun from having to show up here get includes the requested $700,000 for triage one with the additional amendment we will be making to make sure there is an appropriate and well thought out protocol system so we have community places where people can go when 911 is called . We have included these things in addition to making sure the new Department that we are standing up has the support that he needs to invest in the protocol system that Councilmember Herbold led on last year.",223,,
580,0.97,8991.182,8993.384,Get includes the two positions for public records disclosure and I.T.,223,,
581,0.97,8993.384,9014.905,To alleviate the pressure that SPD is currently facing apparently for their lack of response to public records requests . We have included these to make sure we are addressing the long backlog of Pdr request.,223,,
582,0.97,9014.905,9024.382,"In the wake of last year's uprising, there has been rightfully a call to increase the demand for transparency and worker's request we want to do this.",223,,
583,0.97,9024.382,9048.639,"In addition to that, I want to underscore the importance of what Councilmembers have been talking about this morning and that is the investments we are making in the human service Department and community safety programs . We have included in this proposal $3 million, as we talked about previously, to make sure our community organizations who are showing up as alternative to policing are able to have funding and a stability for two years.",223,,
584,0.97,9048.639,9061.852,That is something we have put here for frontline fire responders . It is critical for those experiencing mental health and behavioral health issues.,223,,
585,0.97,9061.852,9072.63,I bring that up to underscore the importance of what is in the's bill to address the pressure we have been hearing about . It is also important to put that information into context of what the data says.,223,,
586,0.97,9072.63,9074.665,The data has been mentioned.,223,,
587,0.97,9074.665,9094.752,"I want to emphasize what we see from our project that led with the headline police say labor day data says no . other industries were devastated by the pandemic last year, police departments across the country including in Seattle saw a much smaller impact.",223,,
588,0.97,9094.752,9104.295,"According to Federal data, the U.S. economy shed 6% of workers and local police departments lost under 1% of employees.",223,,
589,0.97,9104.295,9115.473,"That is something we are all working on addressing by the investments we are making today, by way of the $3 million plus $10 million we have invested in community projects.",223,,
590,0.97,9115.473,9118.509,We are not acting today.,223,,
591,0.97,9118.509,9121.378,We have to talk about why we are acting in the way we are.,223,,
592,0.97,9121.378,9143.033,"We are acting the way we are with this hybrid approach to invest in community partnerships because we know from the National Institute of criminal justice reform, the Seattle police Department calls for services between 2017 2019 found that of the 1.2 million calls for services covering the period, nearly 80% of the calls were for noncriminal events.",223,,
593,0.97,9143.033,9158.549,To me that means it is important for us to be Scaling up the noncriminal response side . that is why I think it is important to have a balanced approach and we work on the amendment.,223,,
594,0.97,9158.549,9169.56,"If only 6% of calls were associated with Felonies, that really underscores the importance for strategies and community oriented solutions to creating stability for community alternatives for policing.",223,,
595,0.97,9169.56,9180.871,That is what I think the proposal in front of us reflected here I will continue to work with all of you to make sure we are addressing the stability our community partners need.,223,,
596,0.97,9180.871,9197.588,"Lastly, I think this policy is a policy decision that should have been discussed in more detail either in committee or in a future Committee for the purposes of really answering the questions of how this strategy would work today.",223,,
597,0.97,9197.588,9210.901,"I would offer to you, colleagues, that the investments we are making help relieve some of the pressure we are hearing about and also appropriately investing in community oriented solutions.",223,,
598,0.97,9210.901,9227.618,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda . are there any additional comments on amendment 3B? okay . I am not hearing any additional comments.",224,,
599,0.97,9227.618,9240.798,Amendment 3B . I will go ahead and call on Pedersen for closing remarks on his amendment.,224,,
600,0.97,9240.798,9241.832,"Thank you, Council President.",225,,
601,0.97,9241.832,9243.067,"Colleagues, thank you for the discussion today.",225,,
602,0.97,9243.067,9267.291,"I remain committed to Reimagining policing and revamping police contracts to provide the most effective Pathway to community safety . I believe that includes not only our increased investments for human services programs and alternative responses, but also acknowledging the staffing crisis.",225,,
603,0.97,9267.291,9281.639,We have known about the staffing crisis for months . I agree it should have been discussed earlier . I believe we have got an obligation to provide adequate police protection in all districts . We need to do both.,225,,
604,0.97,9281.639,9285.242,I look forward to the vote on this and further discussions in the future.,225,,

628,0.97,9343.801,9352.309,Thank you very much and Councilmember Herbold appreciate your leadership as well.,247,,
629,0.97,9352.309,9357.047,I moved to amend Council the 120112 as presented on amendment number four on the agenda.,247,,
630,0.97,9357.047,9358.415,Second.,248,,
631,0.97,9358.415,9363.12,It has been moved and Seconded by Councilmember Herbold.,249,,
632,0.97,9363.12,9367.958,I will head over to Councilmember Mosqueda.,249,,
633,0.97,9367.958,9368.959,Thank you very much.,250,,
634,0.97,9368.959,9390.881,"Colleagues, we are bringing this amendment forward after it being drawn to our attention from first responders at the fire Department, who were on the front line of the triage response proposal . It was a step forward, but the best use of our limited resources responded to noncriminal 911 calls is to make sure we have a place to send folks.",250,,
635,0.97,9390.881,9394.985,We don't want them to be a triage and not to have a landing place for folks.,250,,
636,0.97,9394.985,9406.096,We know there is much work in the pipeline thanks to Councilmember Herbold's leadership to create a protocol system that is permanently being designed as well.,250,,
637,0.97,9406.096,9419.977,"We want to make sure that protocol system is truly flushed out so we don't have a system that ends up referring folks to an emergency room, or SEEKS housing and shelter or medical services when there is an capacity to receive them.",250,,
638,0.97,9419.977,9435.192,"We know much of our shelter services including the most recent data we got last Thursday showed there was only five beds available for the entire night, for all of the folks expressing homelessness out there.",250,,
639,0.97,9435.192,9450.641,"The intent of the triage system, we need to make sure that protocol system is aligned and making sure there is a place to go for those that get visited by the triage team.",250,,
640,0.97,9450.641,9478.468,"I appreciate the work on this and again, thanks to Iff local 27 for their thoughtful approach and for Councilmember Herbold for her Cosponsorship on this and to central staff and the team that has helped create this proposal in front of us . We all want a complete response protocol that at a minimum helps mental health providers and support systems to make sure folks are getting the care that they need after that call is made.",250,,
641,0.97,9478.468,9492.282,Looking forward to learning more from the complete protocol system and the probe is a under this amendment will be lifted when that report is released to Council . Thank you.,250,,
642,0.97,9492.282,9493.851,Thank you so much.,251,,
643,0.97,9493.851,9495.285,Councilmember Herbold?,251,,
644,0.97,9495.285,9549.339,Really quickly I just want to flag that this amendment and proviso is not in any way intended to slow down the launch of the proposed program . As soon as authorization and after the establishment of the protocol system that will make it possible for the community safety and communication center to dispatch a response and ensure that they are sending the right person to either the wellness check or the person by the triage one program.,252,,
645,0.97,9549.339,9558.048,The amendment also flags another discussion that we are having.,252,,
646,0.97,9558.048,9574.965,"In the city right now, there is interest in having housing out of the Seattle fire Department.",252,,
647,0.97,9574.965,9594.251,I just want to remind Council that the vision for the community safety and communication center is broader than the Department to house dispatch functions.,252,,
648,0.97,9594.251,9664.655,"We recently made the decision that we are not going to house parking enforcement officers within the new community service communications center despite our state intention to do so Legislatively . Last year we made a different decision . I want to flag that this amendment parks these dollars, the dollars that are for staff in finance general while we continue the discussion on whether or not these bodies should be housed in the fire Department . If we make the decision to not have the triage one pilot program be staff, we would normally be deciding to minimize the Footprint of the FCC to more than dispatch functions.",252,,
649,0.97,9664.655,9665.756,I just want to flag that.,252,,
650,0.97,9665.756,9680.37,We have asked Seattle fire Department and the FCC for information about the pilot startup signs under both scenarios.,252,,

687,0.97,9813.737,9825.816,"Many of the comments I made earlier, they remain valid for this one as well as in terms of why this amendment is very important.",277,,
688,0.97,9825.816,9846.937,Me know last year the city council placed Provisos in the Spv budget in response to the demand from the justice for George Floyd movement last year to reduce the spending on military policing and to instead invest on building and supporting communities.,277,,
689,0.97,9846.937,9851.241,That is the least the city council should be doing.,277,,
690,0.97,9851.241,9862.752,The supplemental budget would remove supervisors essentially freeing up an additional $7.5 million in the police budget.,277,,

700,0.97,9929.819,9947.27,"During our deliberations last year, the Council worked very hard with community to begin investing in a new Ecosystem, a community safety Ecosystem that really acknowledges the humanity of our residents.",279,,

702,0.97,9951.741,9958.048,I think we made a lot of strides.,279,,
703,0.97,9958.048,9970.427,We are looking at particularly how we invest in community organizations that have alternative options for what community safety could be.,279,,
704,0.97,9970.427,9981.171,We have come a long way . I am acknowledging that need by setting up systems and creating initial investments.,279,,
705,0.97,9981.171,9991.848,"If we are going to have the outcomes we seek, we need to commit to the kind of investments that it'll take to change the community conditions that lead to community safety challenges.",279,,
706,0.97,9991.848,10002.826,Councilmember Lewis earlier laid out I got programs we have begun . We are nearly done with that work.,279,,
707,0.97,10002.826,10010.2,"As several folks have said, the investments we have made our short-term.",279,,
708,0.97,10010.2,10017.507,We need to look at how to invest in a sustainable way so organizations can scale up and really have the outcomes we are talking about.,279,,
709,0.97,10017.507,10019.175,That is one thing I'm really interested in.,279,,
710,0.97,10019.175,10035.024,"The other though, as the physical body for the city, our budgetary and policy decisions are just that, decisions . These are permissive.",279,,

712,0.97,10036.559,10040.93,The appropriation authority that is given to the departments our Guardrails.,279,,
713,0.97,10040.93,10046.002,We have a check and balance system with the executive authority.,279,,
714,0.97,10046.002,10050.64,This is a theoretical.,279,,
715,0.97,10050.64,10066.322,"You know, I think it's important to remember that we are in this position in part because of an intentional Overspend on overtime last year and on other things.",279,,
716,0.97,10066.322,10072.662,It's important to recognize public officials are not allowed to willfully Overspend their budget.,279,,
717,0.97,10072.662,10075.665,"The state values fiscal responsibility, such that over expenditure can result in a misdemeanor.",279,,
718,0.97,10075.665,10095.151,"I think it is important for us as we continue this conversation and particularly as we move into budget conversations in the fall that as a Deliberative body, we make the decision on the appropriation . This isn't something that should just be cured.",279,,
719,0.97,10095.151,10099.389,Overspending shouldn't be cured by exceptions later.,279,,
720,0.97,10099.389,10115.872,I hope as we move into the fall discussion and next year's budget that we continue to support lawful process for community investment and we really commit to holding SPD accountable in the future.,279,,
721,0.97,10115.872,10135.592,They have to perform within their authority in order to serve the city best and I just want to encourage all of us to keep that in mind as we continue this discussion and begin the next discussions over the next few weeks.,279,,
722,0.97,10135.592,10137.327,Iwill be supporting this amendment.,279,,
723,0.97,10137.327,10138.828,Thank you.,279,,
724,0.97,10138.828,10142.499,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales . Councilmember Herbold?",280,,
725,0.97,10142.499,10188.778,"Thank you so much . As I understand this amendment would cut $4.1 million from SPD's 2021 budget and adding $2.41 million to the human services Department's budget in addition to the $3 million the Finance and housing committee added to the budget from SPD . $2.4 million in decisions that the committee made . in our closing remarks, we will get into all of that and how those investments support community safety.",281,,
726,0.97,10188.778,10215.371,"I simply can't support millions of dollars in work when you have painstakingly put in the Finance and budget committee without knowing specifically of, you know, approximately $15 million of investments . where are those dollars coming from?",281,,
727,0.97,10215.371,10267.223,"In addition, if the amendment were to pass it is very likely that SPD will require additional authority from the Council later in 2021 to pay for some of the expenses that we have agreed in the bill coming out of committee . As I mentioned before, it is a high priority of mine to work with the executive to identify what spending priorities are shared between the executive and the Council and to grant that authority . A scenario where they fund their priorities and ask us for permission to Backfill those expenses after the fact.",281,,
728,0.97,10267.223,10279.168,"Finally it is unclear, you know, one of the Provisos lifted is a $550,000 proviso that restricts funds for SPD.",281,,
729,0.97,10279.168,10284.273,They report was sent in June.,281,,
730,0.97,10284.273,10298.721,It lets the proviso as a matter and I'm not sure this was considered by the amendment sponsor in the calculations that the amount be cut for SPD.,281,,
731,0.97,10298.721,10306.095,"Again, to me there is a lot of uncertainty about how that would intersect with the decisions we already made in committee.",281,,

738,0.97,10368.191,10374.03,"Well, of course they will do so anyway . that has been the practice.",283,,
739,0.97,10374.03,10378.868,This amendment comes from precinct budgets.,283,,
740,0.97,10378.868,10404.494,"Just to be clear, I'm not sure that should be a problem, really . It should be completely possible for the police Department to do their work without this $2.41 million . I would really urge the Council to support this.",283,,
741,0.97,10404.494,10404.794,Okay.,284,,
742,0.97,10404.794,10419.509,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Sawant . I did make a call for last comments, but I think I heard Sawant asking for clarification from Councilmember Herbold.",284,,
