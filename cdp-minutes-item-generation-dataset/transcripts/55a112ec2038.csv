691,0.97,4741.336,4744.773,Thank you so much.,223,,
692,0.97,4744.773,4752.948,Colleagues any other comments on this resolution?,223,,
693,0.97,4752.948,4755.784,I am not seeing any hands.,223,,
694,0.97,4755.784,4756.952,Oh Councilmember Herbold.,223,,
695,0.97,4756.952,4766.795,I wanted to mention a couple of items that are included in this moving forward.,224,,
696,0.97,4766.795,4787.916,It is a longstanding request from some members of the South Park community about the South Park status as is urban village and request to council as described in some resolutions associated with Hma.,224,,
697,0.97,4787.916,4791.787,So I appreciate that this amendment was included.,224,,
698,0.97,4791.787,4809.204,Also want to speak to the fact that--pleased at the amendment related to impact fees is included and then Lastly--well there is two more points.,224,,
699,0.97,4809.204,4828.623,As it relates two a transportation element that has not moved forward because it was not considered because it was a repeat--a repeat amendment and that is specifically the amendment in the transportation element of the COMP plan to minimize damage from heavy vehicles.,224,,
700,0.97,4828.623,4840.168,Just want to note that this is really an ongoing issue as it relates to the condition of the streets.,224,,
701,0.97,4840.168,4860.589,Specifically around areas where we have increased the use of transit and also in areas where other types of large vehicles are using the streets to call out the streets around westward village and South park.,224,,
702,0.97,4860.589,4871.199,Want to flag--my interest in finding some way to work on this issue moving forward.,224,,
703,0.97,4871.199,4882.21,Lastly Councilmember Strauss thank you for the request to not move forward regarding an amendment for a proposed housing project in district one.,224,,
704,0.97,4882.21,4894.723,I think why agreed that vision for this property Aligns with many other goals relating to neighborhood access and building community wealth and combating displacement.,224,,
705,0.97,4894.723,4923.118,I know Opcd has stated that they are working Collaboratively with the property owner to identify other options for the site and as Councilmember Strauss mentioned a contract Rezoning is one approach and another approach that Opcd has identified is the recent legislation passed that allows for affordable housing on religious property.,224,,
706,0.97,4923.118,4936.097,The proponents of this amendment have expressed an interest in building housing that is affordable to under 50% AMI.,224,,
707,0.97,4936.097,4950.845,And Opcd States that under the property zoning legislation the current zoning potentially would allow for 30 housing units.,224,,
708,0.97,4950.845,4967.462,Conceivably this is a more expedient path forward since Council bill 120081 has passed conceivably this might be a more expedient approach to meeting these goals rather than a COMP amendment.,224,,
709,0.97,4967.462,4978.707,"So looking forward to discussing the efforts and how to move them forward with the project component, thank you.",224,,
710,0.97,4978.707,4979.207,Thank you.,225,,
711,0.97,4979.207,4979.674,Councilmember Lewis.,225,,
712,0.97,4979.674,4981.676,"Thank you, Madam President.",226,,
713,0.97,4981.676,5010.572,I just want to speak briefly to uplift the hard work of all of the neighbors in the Florencia corridor to get action to provide the necessary security making that neighborhood would like to do in the Florencia area but are currently unable to because of the designation because of arterial.,226,,
714,0.97,5010.572,5028.089,"I wanted to say to earn if you folks are listening up there in Florencia that have been organizing around this, we have heard this is one more hurdle that has passed to get necessary changes in the corridor and have appreciated working with you.",226,,
715,0.97,5028.089,5046.674,I just wish that this could be happening faster and I definitely want to thank Councilmember Strauss for his leadership and making the time and carving out the space for consideration of this change and look forward to moving another step.,226,,

721,0.97,5057.051,5087.182,Great remark and well said and colleagues this process here is one example of why I have such strict parameters around the land use committee about knowledge of intense amendments and legislation because as Councilmember Lewis pointed out for us to make simple changes on the street requires year advance notice before we can take it to the COMP plan and make changes.,227,,
