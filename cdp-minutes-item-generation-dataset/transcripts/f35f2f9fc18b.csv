139,0.97,817.65,821.42,Providing much needed jobs for our under served communities now.,22,,
140,0.97,821.42,825.925,Lets be big and bold coming out of this Covid recession.,22,,

367,0.97,2105.536,2115.413,Like many on the call I don't support the amendment that would lock us into holding a critical revenue stream for one purpose mostly.,62,,
368,0.97,2115.413,2117.915,That would not even prevent another major bridge closure.,62,,
369,0.97,2117.915,2122.52,I have one request before you vote on such a measure.,62,,

392,0.97,2259.757,2260.358,This is Council bill 120044.,67,,
393,0.97,2260.358,2274.271,It is the result of a long process updating Seattle's storm water code.,67,,
394,0.97,2274.271,2285.149,As you will hear there was extensive outreach and a process with the State Department of--leading to these specific changes.,67,,
395,0.97,2285.149,2298.729,"The revisions will have significant environment benefits over time at relatively low cost to number of impacted city departments including Seattle Department of transportation, Seattle city light, parks Department and of course Seattle public utility.",67,,

405,0.97,2323.788,2324.088,Thank you.,68,,
406,0.97,2324.088,2324.322,Okay.,69,,
407,0.97,2324.322,2324.622,Thank you.,69,,
408,0.97,2324.622,2338.269,"Welcome everybody from Spu and for the viewing public and for Council offices, Brian goodnight did put together a central staff memo which is helpful to setting the table for this entire storm water code update.",69,,
409,0.97,2338.269,2341.138,Welcome general manager and your team.,69,,
410,0.97,2341.138,2344.342,We will turn it over to you now.,69,,
411,0.97,2344.342,2348.346,Thank you very much for that excellent introduction.,70,,
412,0.97,2348.346,2350.014,Good morning Council members.,70,,
413,0.97,2350.014,2357.221,Thank you very no such considering this proposed legislation.,70,,
414,0.97,2357.221,2367.098,"The purpose of this storm water code is to protect people, property and the environment from damage caused by storm water run off.",70,,
415,0.97,2367.098,2382.947,"The storm water code updates are required every five years as part of our Department which requires the city to address--and to service water such as rivers, Lakes and streams.",70,,
416,0.97,2382.947,2395.292,Spu has been leading the joint effort with Seattle Department of construction inspections to update Seattle storm water code and also the joint Spusdci manual.,70,,
417,0.97,2395.292,2402.566,S DOT and parks have also been part of the update team.,70,,
418,0.97,2402.566,2405.469,This effort began in late 2019.,70,,
419,0.97,2405.469,2413.711,So quiet a while ago and Council member Pedersen mentioned significant involvement.,70,,
420,0.97,2413.711,2426.357,We are required to complete the update process by July 1ST to maintain permit comply.,70,,
421,0.97,2426.357,2430.327,Iance--compliance.,70,,
422,0.97,2430.327,2431.996,She is here to walk us through the changes.,70,,
423,0.97,2431.996,2436.233,All of us look forward to your questions and feedback.,70,,
424,0.97,2436.233,2440.671,Thank you for your time.,70,,
425,0.97,2440.671,2440.938,Great.,71,,
426,0.97,2440.938,2442.306,"Thank you, Mommy.",71,,
427,0.97,2442.306,2449.78,Thank you--Mami.,71,,
428,0.97,2449.78,2455.753,Thank you for having me here today.,71,,
429,0.97,2455.753,2460.324,For today's agenda I will cover the background relating to the storm water code.,71,,
430,0.97,2460.324,2471.469,Just give me one moment so I can see my screen.,71,,
431,0.97,2471.469,2471.769,There we go.,71,,
432,0.97,2471.769,2471.969,Oops.,71,,
433,0.97,2471.969,2476.14,Uh--Mami gave a good review of that already.,71,,
434,0.97,2476.14,2481.846,I will then go over the outreach we received over the project.,71,,
435,0.97,2481.846,2483.547,Finally I will review the major project schedule.,71,,
436,0.97,2483.547,2487.651,At the end of the presentation Enation there will be an opportunity to ask questions.,71,,
437,0.97,2487.651,2494.091,"As I'm presenting, feel free to let me know if you have any clarifying questions.",71,,
438,0.97,2494.091,2503.1,As Mami mentioned Seattle has had a storm water--well storm water code since 1979 prior to any Federal or state requirements.,71,,
439,0.97,2503.1,2513.911,In 1987 under the clean Federal clean water act a storm water permit for discharges from municipal storm water systems to the receiving water was required.,71,,
440,0.97,2513.911,2519.016,In Washington state the storm water permit is administered by the Department of Ecology.,71,,
441,0.97,2519.016,2522.486,There were various requirements under the first storm water permit.,71,,
442,0.97,2522.486,2532.963,Under the 1995 permit for the first time requirements from municipalities to regulate storm water run off and land use activities was added.,71,,
443,0.97,2532.963,2548.545,Sub--the storm water code has been more recently updated.,71,,
444,0.97,2548.545,2556.02,It is required again now in 2021.,71,,
445,0.97,2556.02,2571.568,"In addition to the requirements to regulate storm water run off, Seattle storm water code also has requirements for source control such as oil spill kits and sweeping for businesses to prevent Pollutants from coming in contact with storm water.",71,,
446,0.97,2571.568,2588.585,Require Mentes installed on properties and other requirements including the requirement for all projects to extend public drainage system.,71,,
447,0.97,2588.585,2595.459,With many of the requirements focussing on reducing Pollutant impacts.,71,,
448,0.97,2595.459,2600.164,It also has a large component associated with mitigating development.,71,,
449,0.97,2600.164,2608.172,Administering the storm water code falls between Sdci and Spu.,71,,
450,0.97,2608.172,2619.316,Spu's responsibility involves development in the right of way as well as enforcing other provisions that are Non-Development related.,71,,
451,0.97,2619.316,2635.499,To help the city administer the code the city also has a storm water manual that includes the technical details and implementation requirements for the code.,71,,
452,0.97,2635.499,2640.004,"It is over 1,000 pages long.",71,,
453,0.97,2640.004,2650.314,"So, why are we doing--why are we updating the code now?",71,,
454,0.97,2650.314,2659.857,Under our 2019-2024 storm water permit we add Mami mentioned we must have new requirements added to our code by this July 1ST.,71,,
455,0.97,2659.857,2687.418,"This date--date is really important because if Seattle misses it, we will be out of compliance with our permit which could mean up to--the city facing fines up--$37,500 a day per violation.",71,,
456,0.97,2687.418,2691.555,So it is very important we don't Miss this deadline.,71,,
457,0.97,2691.555,2733.43,"In addition to meeting the regulatory deadline, this is also important to--[Indiscernible] in addition to meeting the regulatory requirement with Ecology the storm also considered how it would be in service to Lee other goals which include improve and or maintain the city's drain water system, rate payer Affordability and how to clarify and simplify the documents for those who use the manual including the developmental community and city staff.",71,,
458,0.97,2733.43,2767.498,"For goal number one improve or maintain drainage and waste water system t team considered drown stream impacted related to projects including the ditch and Culvert system as well as the combined long term operation and maintenance associated with infrastructure maintained by the city and continuing to build resiliency within the city, especially related to climate change, flooding and impacts to the combined sewer system.",71,,
459,0.97,2767.498,2768.899,Meaning the associated decree.,71,,
460,0.97,2768.899,2772.002,"Rate pair Affordability, two parts were considered.",71,,
461,0.97,2772.002,2784.481,This goal looks to Harmonnize the codes.,71,,
462,0.97,2784.481,2792.389,The city projects use rate payer and tax payer funds to manage storm water run off and address missing drainage infrastructure.,71,,
463,0.97,2792.389,2804.935,We also use this concept in evaluating Develoer's cost and evaluating efficiency of requirements versus installation costs and defining thresholds for requirements.,71,,
464,0.97,2804.935,2819.783,The other part is the concept of gross pay for growth and not Burdening inner generational rate payers.,71,,
465,0.97,2819.783,2827.624,The team's third goal was to clarify and simplify the requirements.,71,,
466,0.97,2827.624,2831.361,We have often heard why is the code so gosh darn complicated.,71,,
467,0.97,2831.361,2838.835,As you know city has complicated system.,71,,
468,0.97,2838.835,2854.885,To try to simplify the requirements where it makes sense both from an engineering perspective and also from an applicant plant review perspective we have--proposed revising thresholds so that they are not--they are more consistent across the city.,71,,
469,0.97,2854.885,2860.424,This results in more similar development costs throughout the city.,71,,
470,0.97,2860.424,2868.599,This effort also includes documenting standard practices for consistency and transparency.,71,,
471,0.97,2868.599,2874.738,In October of 2019 the team started--the public review outreach and public process.,71,,
472,0.97,2874.738,2888.118,This public process included one in person which seems so foreign now and four Online public meetings that were conducted to inform interested stake holders about proposed updates and solicit input.,71,,
473,0.97,2888.118,2891.255,Even with Covid it has gone well.,71,,
474,0.97,2891.255,2899.129,Having meetings Online has seemed to increase participation compared to in person meetings.,71,,
475,0.97,2899.129,2911.074,"These meetings included representatives from the community, environment advocacy groups and engineering and consulting firms.",71,,
476,0.97,2911.074,2930.594,Prior to today's meet--[Indiscernible] there has also been information shared at master builder Association meetings.,71,,
477,0.97,2930.594,2940.337,Through this outreach we received over 200 public comments.,71,,
478,0.97,2940.337,2946.743,With that no significant outstanding concerns have been identified with the stone water code update.,71,,
479,0.97,2946.743,2947.177,Thank you.,72,,
480,0.97,2947.177,2954.651,Could we--I think we have a question from vice chair Strauss.,72,,
481,0.97,2954.651,2955.385,"Thank you, council.",73,,
482,0.97,2955.385,2955.819,"Thank you, chair.",73,,
483,0.97,2955.819,2959.923,It was on the last slide I believe that I already know the answer.,73,,
484,0.97,2959.923,2967.831,I was kind of--the question was regarding investing in infrastructure.,73,,
485,0.97,2967.831,2971.768,What connection that has to the ship Canal water quality project.,73,,
486,0.97,2971.768,2976.907,My sense is it doesn't connect but wanted to ask the question to clarify.,73,,
487,0.97,2976.907,2982.846,"Before we get to that, I will Editorialize because we on the outreach and feedback.",73,,
488,0.97,2982.846,2994.558,I am incredibly impressed with the number of years and outreach you have completed to engage in this project.,73,,
489,0.97,2994.558,3009.106,"Often times the city engages in outreach in one directional engagement--meet with a group, listen to their feedback and never return to that group.",73,,
490,0.97,3009.106,3019.616,Could you help me understand what feedback loop was created to ensure that--stake holders knew that their feedback was being incorporated?,73,,
491,0.97,3019.616,3035.732,I would say that the feedback loop includes--uh--just the multiple options that we had for outreach and so that it was--we are very clear on red lines and showing what it changed over between different review periods.,74,,
492,0.97,3035.732,3040.937,I would say that is the main loop that we had.,74,,
493,0.97,3040.937,3062.192,"Also we met with master builders and got some feedback from them and--have incorporated that their language in the director's role that I will be mentioning and--that--while that hasn't been posted yet, we did hear from them and it is a much better document because of that.",74,,
494,0.97,3062.192,3076.54,"As far as your question about the--um--the ship Canal, I would say as far as rain from structure, a lot of that is focused on requirements when I was mentioning that.",74,,
495,0.97,3076.54,3102.365,"Uh--it also talks about, Uh, toward development and looking at the size of Detention especially in the combined and ensuring overall and through the city that we are um--this size of the detention system is adequate mitigating the development impacts and before analyzing that it wasn't.",74,,
496,0.97,3102.365,3121.985,"I would say that is how it ties in with the ship Canal but also with our combined sewer in general and flooding and other issues as well so, yes.",74,,
497,0.97,3121.985,3122.819,Thank you.,75,,
498,0.97,3122.819,3124.321,That is very helpful.,75,,
499,0.97,3124.321,3124.988,There is an ongoing engagement.,75,,
500,0.97,3124.988,3130.927,It is not a we came to meet with you once and moved on.,75,,
501,0.97,3130.927,3135.232,You--you engaged multiple times and in multiple ways?,75,,
502,0.97,3135.232,3135.999,Yes.,76,,
503,0.97,3135.999,3136.666,Good work.,77,,
504,0.97,3136.666,3137.067,Thank you.,77,,
505,0.97,3137.067,3137.834,Thank you.,78,,
506,0.97,3137.834,3140.57,Thank you.,79,,
507,0.97,3140.57,3151.815,Could you circulate the language you incorporated in.,79,,
508,0.97,3151.815,3152.048,Sure.,80,,
509,0.97,3152.048,3162.325,-- thank you.,81,,
510,0.97,3162.325,3177.908,"Um--so, I think--I was--Hi gone--I will continue where I left off and--um--I--as far as the storm water code updates, I will start there.",82,,
511,0.97,3177.908,3186.783,The high level Summery includes adding exemptions for certain land deserving activities to facilitate construction of storm water projects.,82,,
512,0.97,3186.783,3206.002,This is the age--the city--especially installing storm water facilities but also helps to--also applies to other voluntary projects by third parties.,82,,
513,0.97,3206.002,3210.507,So get more projects in the ground.,82,,
514,0.97,3210.507,3212.242,Clarification regarding alternative comply Groons regional facilities.,82,,
515,0.97,3212.242,3217.847,Basically again having the right solution in the right place.,82,,
516,0.97,3217.847,3220.35,Definitions have been clarified and added.,82,,
517,0.97,3220.35,3226.423,Mainly associated with a storm water movement equivalency requirements.,82,,
518,0.97,3226.423,3247.744,"And for subdivisions, another closely related project, added requirements to make sure that--make sure projects mitigate impacts and to address possible--and then also rules clarifying preliminary drainage review requirements for master use was also added.",82,,
519,0.97,3247.744,3258.021,Over items I include clarification of the existing main line extension requirements.,82,,
520,0.97,3258.021,3279.109,"If one is not in front of the property regardless of project size, and the proposed update now clarifies in the minimum requirements for all projects the size of the project that is required to extend the public drainage system instead of all projects.",82,,
521,0.97,3279.109,3292.522,They will not be documented in a separate role instead of relying on standard practice so there is more transparency and predict ability for the development community and clarity for drainage review staff.,82,,
522,0.97,3292.522,3302.065,This new rule also clarifies what is and isn't a public drainage system to helped a more storm water to the system.,82,,
523,0.97,3302.065,3311.808,This rule also Aligns with the main line extension requirements documented.,82,,
524,0.97,3311.808,3325.588,"To expand the Toolbox for drain storm water infrastructure and address comments from users, updates were made to the list for all project types including revisions to rain water harvesting for buildings.",82,,
525,0.97,3325.588,3344.107,And to help simplify the code and have more similar costs throughout the city there are proposed changes to requirements of storm water volume and rates of discharges for both private development and projects in the right of way as well as more consistent thresholds for projects across the city.,82,,
526,0.97,3344.107,3356.052,In working with parks and to help release pesticides--that are used on a site.,82,,
527,0.97,3356.186,3372.736,"[Indiscernible] Finally, preliminary review plan requirements were added for subdivisions so, it has been a long project.",82,,
528,0.97,3372.736,3397.427,"We are getting towards he end but--this is the same schedule you saw previously but before I move on I just really to the final schedule steps, I just really would like to acknowledge extended team effort that involved multiple city departments with big LIFTS by not only Spu members but Sdci and Sdot as well as parks to get us where we are today on updating the storm water code.",82,,
529,0.97,3397.427,3404.968,I want to thank the entire team for the efforts on the project.,82,,
530,0.97,3404.968,3415.912,As mentioned we started the public input and review process in October of 2019 and have done outreach that has led to receiving many thought of the comments from stake holders.,82,,
531,0.97,3415.912,3420.116,Many of which were--we were able to address.,82,,
532,0.97,3420.116,3436.432,"We have also worked to ensure our requirements are--with the state--with the state and as far as timing though, there is some urgency around having this ordinance signed into law sooner rather than later.",82,,
533,0.97,3436.432,3438.468,One reason is to be Compliant.,82,,
534,0.97,3438.468,3444.174,So that Seattle does not Miss the--the required effective date of July 1ST.,82,,
535,0.97,3444.174,3455.251,The other is to considerate to our stake holder's needs.,82,,
536,0.97,3455.251,3464.294,For good customer service both internally and externally we would like to give as much notice as possible to these stake holders.,82,,
537,0.97,3464.294,3477.907,"If this legislation can move out today and things continue to go smoothly, stake holders will have approximately 45 days to adjust to this legislation.",82,,
538,0.97,3477.907,3485.181,You are probably wondering what will the code update mean the project costs within the city of Seattle.,82,,
539,0.97,3485.181,3488.885,Every project is unique with its own opportunities and challenges.,82,,
540,0.97,3488.885,3500.063,Overall we are anticipating lower costs for many smaller projects of which there are more of and some costs increases to large projects.,82,,
541,0.97,3500.063,3512.175,What we hear most frequently from our development partners is for the cost of main line extensions.,82,,
542,0.97,3512.175,3532.462,Costs will day crease and the cost to build storm water projects are also expected to decrease.,82,,
543,0.97,3532.462,3551.748,Further stretching our rate dollars to help curb pollution and control flooding while ensuring we are building the right project in the right place X. with that I will conclude my presentation and thank you for allowing me the opportunity to present the proposed storm water changes due today and for your consideration on this legislation.,82,,
544,0.97,3551.748,3556.552,Let me know if you have any questions.,82,,
545,0.97,3556.552,3556.92,Thank you.,83,,
546,0.97,3556.92,3559.022,"Brian goodnight, did you want to add anything at this point?",83,,
547,0.97,3559.022,3561.991,I know we can look at your memo as well.,83,,
548,0.97,3561.991,3562.592,Thank you.,84,,
549,0.97,3562.592,3566.663,"I don't have anything to add, chair",84,,
550,0.97,3566.663,3566.896,Okay.,85,,
551,0.97,3566.896,3575.705,"And general manager, did you have anything to add before we jump into any questions and talk about scheduling?",85,,
552,0.97,3575.705,3576.239,No.,86,,
553,0.97,3576.239,3582.345,Just reiterate our thanks for everybody's consideration and time.,86,,
554,0.97,3582.345,3582.579,Okay.,87,,
555,0.97,3582.579,3586.316,"Colleagues, we can--we can ask questions now.",87,,
556,0.97,3586.316,3603.199,"I wanted to pitch a scheduling idea is that--what we can do because this is a complex update, sounds like we can see what a great job Seattle public utilities has done by bringing stake holders along through this process.",87,,
557,0.97,3603.199,3605.134,They do have a July 1 deadline.,87,,
558,0.97,3605.134,3620.917,"Because it is so complicated what--what I would like to propose is we--if we are comfortable with it to vote it out today but instead of it going to full Council on Monday May 10, it would go on to 17th or the 24th.",87,,
559,0.97,3620.917,3631.661,We can work out with Council President's office based on how full the schedules are.,87,,
560,0.97,3631.661,3641.637,Instead of it just going straight to Council because it is so complicated to have it skip a week basically.,87,,
561,0.97,3641.637,3648.044,"Council members, are there any questions about the meat of the proposal here updating the storm water code?",87,,
562,0.97,3648.044,3652.281,Council member Herbold and then Council member Gonzalez.,87,,
563,0.97,3652.281,3653.383,Thank you so much.,88,,
564,0.97,3653.383,3681.477,On the--I believe it is slide 5 on the--um--it refers to one of the--one of the intended objectives is Affordability and ensuring growth pays for growth and encouraging generational equity.,88,,
565,0.97,3681.477,3689.819,Can you speak to how the code updates as recommended address that goal?,88,,
566,0.97,3689.819,3720.65,"I would say that--um--the--in looking at Affordability, just looking at long term where rate care funds are going, um--right now--uh--in the current code, um, especially for roadway projects and city projects, it requires installation of tanks within--not necessarily in the right spot or the right place.",89,,
567,0.97,3720.65,3722.852,It hasn't been analyzed.,89,,
568,0.97,3722.852,3757.12,So looking at--instead having especially city projects working on the infrastructure missing throughout the city when they are updating--when we are updating projects from different parts of the city and really relying on the expertise to find right project and the right project place to mitigate storm water impacts and--but also with development and city projects building infrastructure at the time the projects are going in.,89,,
569,0.97,3757.12,3762.458,Instead of relying on rate care funds.,89,,
570,0.97,3762.458,3772.768,I don't know if--if Mami or maybe Andrew wanted--[Indiscernible] in how we look at that.,89,,
571,0.97,3772.768,3772.969,Yeah.,89,,
572,0.97,3772.969,3773.202,Yeah.,90,,
573,0.97,3773.202,3793.99,"You know Council member I would say that the overall code enforces as development happens or as construction is happening, having the developer pay for it, what we found that when that doesn't happen, then--eventual homeowner might have costs they have to incur down road or the rate payers end up paying for it.",90,,
574,0.97,3793.99,3798.828,The rate payers did not profit obviously from the development that occurred.,90,,
575,0.97,3798.828,3803.933,That overall principle is reinforced in this code update.,90,,
576,0.97,3803.933,3805.301,I understand the problem.,91,,
577,0.97,3805.301,3810.54,I am asking how the--code update addresses the problem.,91,,
578,0.97,3810.54,3810.806,Right.,92,,
579,0.97,3810.806,3812.542,What is different?,93,,
580,0.97,3812.542,3813.309,What is different?,94,,
581,0.97,3813.309,3845.041,"Um--the difference is--um--instead of the--of those projects--the roadway projects that I was talking about, instead of installing those giant tanks in the middle of the road the individual projects are going to look at the system and make sure that the system itself has the parks that are there, you know in a Drayage rain from structure is missing, that is installed and--sized adequately if it is under sized now.",94,,
582,0.97,3845.041,3862.124,So that--the code was somewhat silent on that before and just really enforcing and--looking at the big picture of--of switching the--the emphasis on storm water management.,94,,
583,0.97,3862.124,3870.066,"It sounds like you said--that this--this change would only affect city projects, public projects.",95,,
584,0.97,3870.066,3876.706,It is not a change that affects the projects that private developers are building.,95,,
585,0.97,3876.706,3898.661,It does--it could in a sense affect private development as we work through the implementation of this infrastructure and in stalling Culverts and different downstream--downstream infrastructure where there may be missing infrastructure.,96,,
586,0.97,3898.661,3925.454,We are look at a phased approach with that and making sure that we are not--that we are getting our ducks in a row working with city projects and then eventually looking forward to development and their impacts in making sure they are not causing flooding downstream of their projects.,96,,
587,0.97,3925.454,3925.788,Thank you.,97,,
588,0.97,3925.788,3926.389,Thank you.,98,,
589,0.97,3926.389,3936.265,I had questions along the same line soy won't--I won't Re-Ask the same questions.,99,,
590,0.97,3936.265,3939.268,My thanks to you on picking up that particular thread.,99,,
591,0.97,3939.268,3943.439,That is the thread I was most interested in as well.,99,,
592,0.97,3943.439,4004.367,"Related to the issues of Affordability and private projects, I heard from--I heard a concern from a constituent recently who is developing--um--some property with the goal of participating in the housing Affordability program and I was wondering if--if you could talk a little bit about how this impacts private development for those developers who are looking at participating in either voluntary or otherwise in our housing Affordability program and whether Spu has taken into account or done any analysis of how these code changes and potential increase costs may impact participation in that Affordability program.",99,,
593,0.97,4004.367,4025.354,Um--I would say directly there hasn't been a direct comparison or analysis between the two but we are aware that--adding costs to affordable housing is a--is--can be a detriment to that.,100,,
594,0.97,4025.354,4050.146,Um--I think--we overall are considering the long term impacts of development and how--um--and that having the development mitigate its direct impacts and so--I--I--I don't.,100,,
595,0.97,4050.146,4066.028,There--there is increases to some projects because of the impacts and the requirements will--um--cause increases because of that but it also is looking at the direct impacts of that project.,100,,
596,0.97,4066.028,4076.038,So--I can't--I don't have a great answer for you obviously.,100,,
597,0.97,4076.038,4076.705,"Yeah, no worries.",101,,
598,0.97,4076.705,4109.205,"I think in light of the proposed schedule by chair Pedersen related to this legislation, I would find it helpful if in the two week interim if--Spu could work with Brian goodnight to just help me understand a little bit more deeply that the potential impacts to project costs for those projects who are participating in the housing Affordability program.",101,,
599,0.97,4109.205,4124.487,Particularly for those projects that are intending to build the affordable housing on site and I think different--it is a different issue in terms of whether they are sort of paying as opposed to building.,101,,
600,0.97,4124.487,4141.904,I--I am specifically asking questions about those--the project costs associated with these code changes for those projects in which developers Curn'Tly plan to build affordable housing on site through our mandatory housing Affordability program.,101,,
601,0.97,4141.904,4157.186,I want to make sure we aren't creating some unintended consequences as it relates to increasing these project costs so significantly that then people have another reason to not build affordable housing on site right away.,101,,
602,0.97,4157.186,4172.668,"So if that is what we think is going to be an affect, and we don't intend that to be the effect, then I think there is a policy choice for us to make about the scope and the App Olympic ability here.",101,,
603,0.97,4172.668,4179.775,If I may--we--so--we would love to find out more details.,102,,
604,0.97,4179.775,4185.014,I think every development project ends up being so different in terms of what the costs are that are incurred.,102,,
605,0.97,4185.314,4194.99,"Smaller projects, the prices went down.",102,,
606,0.97,4194.99,4200.863,That was because of some of the thresholds that we changed to make everything more consistent.,102,,
607,0.97,4200.863,4205.401,She did mention some of the larger projects costs may have gone up.,102,,
608,0.97,4205.401,4210.506,However I want to reinforce it was a pretty marginal increase.,102,,
609,0.97,4210.506,4211.54,I wasn't significant.,102,,
610,0.97,4211.54,4219.148,The one situation that gets highlighted for us quite a bit is when developers have to do extensions.,102,,
611,0.97,4219.148,4222.117,"That involves potentially costly work out in the right of way, right?",102,,
612,0.97,4222.117,4226.188,And those--those can be in the hundreds of thousands.,102,,
613,0.97,4226.188,4236.131,The one thing that she pointed out earlier was for those projects the existing code even without any code change already requires to do those extensions.,102,,
614,0.97,4236.131,4239.234,So that is not actually a result of this particular thing.,102,,
615,0.97,4239.234,4246.875,What we did is clarified that to make it a little more clear to developers what those conditions are.,102,,
616,0.97,4246.875,4256.552,And so--but again would be happy to look at the specifics of that particular case and also respond to your general question about mandated sort of affordable housing.,102,,
617,0.97,4256.552,4256.885,Okay.,103,,
618,0.97,4256.885,4276.905,What you are saying is that this--the storm water rain from structure code updates that we are discussing now do not--there is no relationship between these code updates and the--the requirements related to the extensions.,103,,
619,0.97,4276.905,4277.706,That is right.,104,,
620,0.97,4277.706,4281.677,That is not a new requirement.,104,,
621,0.97,4281.677,4282.778,That did not exist.,104,,
622,0.97,4282.778,4283.812,Okay.,105,,
623,0.97,4283.812,4291.754,"So if the concern from this constituent is about the main line extensions, that is--that is--that is a concern.",105,,
624,0.97,4291.754,4292.388,Yes.,106,,
625,0.97,4292.388,4305.167,It is costly but it is not being triggered or exacerbate or worsened by virtue of the Council's consideration of the storm water code updates you are proposing?,107,,
626,0.97,4305.167,4305.834,That is accurate.,108,,
627,0.97,4305.834,4306.101,Okay.,109,,
628,0.97,4306.101,4307.002,That is helpful.,109,,
629,0.97,4307.002,4315.444,That might have been what the concern was.,109,,
630,0.97,4315.444,4330.392,"So, I--if we can just sort of--I will follow up with you and get you more details to make sure that--that--that--that this conversation here is still applicable and relevant to that need.",109,,
631,0.97,4330.392,4337.032,I will make sure to follow up with you.,109,,
632,0.97,4337.032,4337.566,Thank you.,109,,
633,0.97,4337.566,4338.901,"Thank you, Council President.",110,,
634,0.97,4338.901,4358.887,"Brian, if you do end up expanding your memo a bit, if you could also look at any exemptions--make sure we are taking full advantage of any exemptions that exist under state law as I understand Rcw does provide some exemptions for affordable housing.",110,,
635,0.97,4358.887,4361.89,Maybe how they are defining affordable housing.,110,,
636,0.97,4361.89,4366.395,That is key to this.,110,,
637,0.97,4366.395,4370.666,Just want to make sure we are maximizing our exemptions.,110,,
638,0.97,4370.666,4376.972,Making growth pay for growth and maybe find passing that on to For-Profit developers in some cases.,110,,
639,0.97,4376.972,4389.318,We want that make sure we are exempting the additional costs when we can.,110,,
640,0.97,4389.318,4390.119,Thank you.,110,,
641,0.97,4390.119,4390.819,Council member Strauss.,110,,
642,0.97,4390.819,4391.52,"Thank you, chair.",111,,
643,0.97,4391.52,4400.395,Now you have me second guessing if I'm saying your name right.,111,,
644,0.97,4400.395,4419.248,"That is because chair, colleagues, I spent a very long time--we went way over the typically a Lotted hour that Spu gives me for asking hundreds of questions in some sense--in some ways at my Pre-Committee briefing.",111,,
645,0.97,4419.248,4429.525,You did an amazing job being responsive to the questions and following up with the answers that we didn't have at that moment.,111,,
646,0.97,4429.525,4443.839,What that provided for me is the understanding of what this code does--already in code and what this--what--[Indiscernible] is providing clarity.,111,,
647,0.97,4443.839,4447.176,It is providing clarity with the exemptions we have in place.,111,,
648,0.97,4447.176,4452.881,It is providing clarity with what is required as is what is intended to be required.,111,,
649,0.97,4452.881,4462.324,And it provides clarity with the exemptions that have been historically made yet not in code.,111,,
650,0.97,4462.324,4486.782,Typically I am of the mindset we need to have two committee meetings for a bill under--with the responsiveness that Spu has provided me between briefing and now and the need to ensure we don't open ourselves to liability because we did not receive this--this bill is not transmitted to us in a time.,111,,
651,0.97,4486.782,4496.091,I feel comfortable with your proposal of passing it out today and holding it until for two weeks till full council.,111,,
652,0.97,4496.091,4514.009,"I guess I wanted to again raise up this code change clarifies what has already been required, clarifies the exemptions and provides more clarity.",111,,
653,0.97,4514.009,4514.977,Thank you.,111,,
654,0.97,4514.977,4515.711,Thank you Andrew.,111,,

658,0.97,4530.325,4531.827,Council members any of questions?,112,,
659,0.97,4531.827,4532.16,All right.,112,,
660,0.97,4532.16,4540.903,I now move that the committee recommend approval of Council 120044 which is item 1 on our agenda.,112,,
661,0.97,4540.903,4541.37,Is there a second?,112,,
662,0.97,4541.37,4542.337,Second.,113,,
663,0.97,4542.337,4545.841,It has been moved into second.,114,,
664,0.97,4545.841,4559.021,Will the clerk please call the role on the committee recommendation to approve Council bill 120044?,114,,

678,0.97,4574.67,4575.437,The motion carries.,126,,
679,0.97,4575.437,4585.047,The committee recommendation that the bill passed would be sent to a future city council meeting not May 10 but may 17th or may 24th.,126,,
680,0.97,4585.047,4592.12,We will look forward to getting more information from central staff working with Spu.,126,,

687,0.97,4632.761,4637.666,We plan to vote ton corresponding Council resolution at committee today.,128,,
688,0.97,4637.666,4648.043,As we know Spu's track Teenagic plan has been endorsed by the rigorous customer review panel.,128,,
689,0.97,4648.043,4663.992,The average rates are expected to be lower than what was originally promised back in 2017.,128,,
690,0.97,4663.992,4692.054,"There was a thorough article earlier this week in the Seattle times about the strategic plan and rate path which explores the various cost drivers including inflation past the rates imposed by King County for waste waste water, environmental protection costs required by our State and Federal governments, labor costs and even the utility taxes charged by our general fund.",128,,
691,0.97,4692.054,4693.955,This is resolution 32000.,128,,
692,0.97,4693.955,4700.629,It would adopt the strategic business plan.,128,,
693,0.97,4700.629,4702.597,There are four separate services.,128,,
694,0.97,4702.597,4705.3,"Water, waste water, drain Orange and solid waste.",128,,
695,0.97,4705.3,4716.445,"These business lines, each of them have their own rate structure.",128,,
696,0.97,4716.445,4727.522,The rates for 2021 for all four Searchs have already been set.,128,,
697,0.97,4727.522,4732.427,"So, Brian goodnight, would you like to introduce this item?",128,,
698,0.97,4732.427,4732.961,Thank you.,129,,
699,0.97,4732.961,4752.147,I will just NOTE in addition to the fact it has been considered at the previous two meetings as you suggested that the plan that would be adopted by the resolution does contain new mission and vision for Spu.,129,,
700,0.97,4752.147,4767.262,So in addition to adopting the plan the resolution also requests that the executives submit budget Ands rate legislation when appropriate.,129,,
701,0.97,4767.262,4776.238,That Absents justifiable circumstance s is consistent with the plan.,129,,
702,0.97,4776.238,4788.15,Per Council direction Spu typically reviews and updates the plan every three years.,129,,
703,0.97,4788.15,4795.724,The next update is scheduled to occur in 2023.,129,,
704,0.97,4795.724,4795.957,Thanks.,129,,
705,0.97,4795.957,4796.291,Thank you.,130,,
706,0.97,4796.291,4816.511,And a--just a--a shout out to Council member Herbold who chaired this area before I did and a lot of that working with general manager Hara and others really set us on this good path where they were able to come in at a lower increase than expected on average.,130,,
707,0.97,4816.511,4820.949,"General manager Hara, would you like to take it away?",130,,
708,0.97,4820.949,4826.588,We would just like to thank everybody on Council for all of their consideration.,131,,
709,0.97,4826.588,4827.722,This has been a long process.,131,,
710,0.97,4827.722,4839.367,It has been several years in the making to bring our rate path down and come to this place.,131,,
711,0.97,4839.367,4855.183,We always welcome further ideas to further lower our rate path as we go along our commitment is to stay below what we have projected as far as possible and to improve our practices in order to do so.,131,,
712,0.97,4855.183,4862.123,So--just--thank you again for your consideration of passage of our strategic business plan.,131,,
713,0.97,4862.123,4872.934,"And Council member, just as reminder there was a presentation at the previous committee meeting where it went through the power points and those are Online still.",132,,
714,0.97,4872.934,4883.645,"Were there any Fooinl final questions--yes, council member Herbold?",132,,
715,0.97,4883.645,4889.818,In Brian's issue Id paper really appreciate highlighting some options for us to consider.,133,,
716,0.97,4889.818,4920.548,"One--one--want to highlight that owl though we aren't pursuing any changes in--the utility tax structure which is a--it is a driver of rates as well, I want to highlight the work that the utility did as a result of the previous strategic business plan to at the very least create some transparency around the utility tax.",133,,
717,0.97,4920.548,4924.119,That is now shown on rate payer's bills.,133,,
718,0.97,4924.119,4928.123,Really appreciate the utility's commitment to that work in the past.,133,,
719,0.97,4928.123,4949.544,I do have a question though about the--sort of the rate smoothing question option that--Brian included Referenced to in the--in the issue Id paper as it related specifically to drainage and waste water rates.,133,,
720,0.97,4949.544,4963.558,"I am wondering, can you--because we--we aren't--we aren't suing--an amendment to the rate path to reflect rate smooth at this point.",133,,
721,0.97,4963.558,4986.715,Can you talk through the pros and cons of that because I--I do know that--we did do some significant rate smoothing on--on the city's line of business in previous years and just wondering sort of what the barriers are in doing so for drain Orange and waste water.,133,,
722,0.97,4986.715,4988.383,"Thank you, council member.",134,,
723,0.97,4988.383,4990.585,I don't know there are necessarily barriers.,134,,
724,0.97,4990.585,5006.401,I think that in this case the rates that are proposed aren't as volatile as the one proposed the last time around.,134,,
725,0.97,5006.401,5016.077,"I am sure you recognize the executive is proposing as to the previous proposal was--going to be 10.3 Sxers then 0%, then 10.3% and 0%.",134,,
726,0.97,5016.077,5016.878,It is every other year.,134,,
727,0.97,5016.878,5023.852,In the last week or so they have proposed to equally do smaller annual increases instead.,134,,
728,0.97,5023.852,5031.593,That will equally have impacts on--it will increase the volatility of the rates.,134,,
729,0.97,5031.593,5039.901,So I think that--I don't know that we need to react to that necessarily right now because this is just a plan.,134,,
730,0.97,5039.901,5059.754,"Assuming the King County Council and all of them do approve of that using the rates that are less volatile, that would be incorporated into any rate packages.",134,,
731,0.97,5059.754,5060.388,It would be smoothed overtime.,134,,
732,0.97,5060.388,5075.67,I know that--many of us have been advocating for rate smoothing but had no heard that King County was coming back with a different proposal.,135,,
733,0.97,5075.67,5078.807,That is great.,135,,
734,0.97,5078.807,5079.107,Thank you.,135,,
735,0.97,5079.107,5080.475,You are welcome.,136,,
736,0.97,5080.475,5080.708,Thanks.,136,,
737,0.97,5080.708,5097.992,"If I may, I would--like to extend my sincere appreciations to Council member Herbold and Council member Pedersen for their many long hours of work on those committees and their advocacy on behalf of rate payers.",137,,
738,0.97,5097.992,5099.928,Volatility is something we aim to avoid.,137,,
739,0.97,5099.928,5106.534,That was probably the most significant driver.,137,,
740,0.97,5106.534,5111.372,So thank you very much.,137,,
741,0.97,5111.372,5112.74,Thank you.,138,,
742,0.97,5112.74,5113.108,Appreciate that.,138,,
743,0.97,5113.108,5137.298,As we--Spu has pulled a lot of levers to keep the rate increases as low as possible and to come in lower than previously promised I think--as we look at the--the strategic plan three years from now we have to do a lot of work even starting from this year thinking about that.,138,,
744,0.97,5137.298,5156.851,"It is about 123-00-0000 to general fund gets from the utility rate payers and then something that Council member Herbold looked at previously taking additional time to explore the issue of system development charges, our rates are much lower than other jurisdictions for various things.",138,,
745,0.97,5156.851,5165.426,We don't even charge drainage system development charge so we will be looking at that more as we prepare for the next--because a lot of the levers have already been pulled.,138,,
746,0.97,5165.426,5184.345,If we want to keep the rate path not increasing so sharply on these Regressive charges we need to look again at the utility tax and whether it is phasing or tapering off of some of that and then system development charges.,138,,
747,0.97,5184.345,5185.413,Are we optimizing those options?,138,,
748,0.97,5185.413,5191.152,I will be looking into those for sure.,138,,
749,0.97,5191.152,5203.865,"Well Council members if there are no further questions on this item, I will go ahead and move this.",138,,
750,0.97,5203.865,5204.165,One moment.,138,,
751,0.97,5204.165,5204.365,Okay.,138,,
752,0.97,5204.365,5213.541,So Council members I now move the committee recommend approval of resolution 320000 which is item 2 on our agenda.,138,,
753,0.97,5213.541,5214.576,Is there a second?,138,,
754,0.97,5214.576,5215.376,Second.,139,,
755,0.97,5215.376,5215.71,Thank you.,140,,
756,0.97,5215.71,5218.68,It has been moved and Seconded to recommend passage.,140,,

768,0.97,5241.636,5243.504,"Five in favor, none opposed.",151,,
769,0.97,5243.504,5244.439,Thank you.,152,,
770,0.97,5244.439,5254.849,The motion carries and the committee recommendation that the resolution passes amended will be sent to the May 10 city council meeting for final consideration.,152,,
771,0.97,5254.849,5259.354,Thank you everybody from Seattle public utilities.,152,,
772,0.97,5259.354,5259.52,Bye.,152,,
773,0.97,5259.52,5266.694,Will the clerk please read the title of the next agenda item into the record.,152,,
774,0.97,5266.694,5268.262,Agenda item 3.,153,,
775,0.97,5268.262,5268.73,Council bill 120045.,153,,
776,0.97,5268.73,5308.703,An ordinance relating to the city light Department declaring certain real property rights to be surplus to the needs of city light and authorizing the general manager and chief executive officer of city light to execute an easement agreement with King County allowing the temporary use of a portion of city light property to resolve the Enkroen Chment of an existing structure located on the West side of Boeing field within the northeast corner of section 29 Township 24 range 4 and the southeast quarter of section 29 Township 24 range 4.,153,,
777,0.97,5308.703,5309.203,Thank you.,154,,
778,0.97,5309.203,5311.873,That is a very jazzy title for an ordinance.,154,,
779,0.97,5311.873,5314.709,This is the Georgetown South Park trail.,154,,
780,0.97,5314.709,5321.449,It is another important piece of that Council bill 120045.,154,,
781,0.97,5321.449,5326.12,This is a temporary lease for a small Triangle of land along that route.,154,,
782,0.97,5326.12,5333.594,After adopting its ordinance we expect to see the final actions authorizing construction of the trail project later this summer.,154,,
783,0.97,5333.594,5347.041,The total project costs for the trail creating important connection between district 1 and District 2 is about $7.5 million.,154,,
784,0.97,5347.041,5355.65,We have--our city council central staff Eric Mcconaghy here with as well.,154,,
785,0.97,5355.65,5358.686,Did you want to introduce the legislation at all?,154,,
786,0.97,5358.686,5390.518,I will add that--as we have heard in other meetings of this committee there is a certain number of a legislative pieces were built like blocks adding up to ultimately the petition for vacation of a--of property near where city light would like to have some more room to work and part of that would be the transfer of this property that we are talking about today.,155,,
787,0.97,5390.518,5401.362,"It has been methodical and straightforward in a certain way that there are multiple pieces that clean up the books, make things ready for the ultimate move you described.",155,,
788,0.97,5401.362,5410.772,With that I will just step out of the the way and let the experts to their presentation.,155,,
789,0.97,5410.772,5411.672,"Thank you, Eric.",156,,
790,0.97,5411.672,5412.807,Welcome Seattle city light folks.,156,,
791,0.97,5412.807,5413.508,Go ahead and get started.,156,,
792,0.97,5413.508,5417.912,We might have some questions for you.,156,,
793,0.97,5417.912,5418.579,Good morning Council members.,157,,
794,0.97,5418.579,5424.752,Debora sends her regards and apologizes she was not able to make today's meeting.,157,,
795,0.97,5424.752,5437.231,As was mentioned this--item is clarifying property rights in an area as we have been working on a couple of different items.,157,,
796,0.97,5437.231,5445.706,Tim Croll is here to present the issue to you.,157,,
797,0.97,5445.706,5448.009,Thank you.,158,,
798,0.97,5448.009,5448.409,"Next slide, Maura.",158,,
799,0.97,5448.409,5468.262,So as they mentioned ultimately we want to develop an off leash dog park and a trail segment of the Georgetown trail which is.,159,,
800,0.97,5468.262,5482.71,"First we need to resolve this bit of unfinished business there is an incumbent on property, an Enkroen Chment--encroachment by a King County building.",159,,
801,0.97,5482.71,5489.851,So the ownership is really clear when parks comes into possession of this property.,159,,
802,0.97,5489.851,5490.484,"Next, please.",159,,
803,0.97,5490.484,5507.301,And so this shows where our South service center is by the West Seattle freeway and fourth Avenue and--down at the South end of that there is a little section of Street right of way we are looking to Combsh--we will request to vacate.,159,,
804,0.97,5507.301,5507.635,Next slide.,159,,
805,0.97,5507.635,5512.907,As Council members are well aware every street vacation needs an offsetting public benefit.,159,,
806,0.97,5512.907,5535.63,"The main part of our public benefit is the transfer of this piece of the Red there, this piece of property in Georgetown to Sdot and to parks for their different uses to build community amenities so our public benefit will transfer this public plus some city light financial support for the development of those projects.",159,,
807,0.97,5535.63,5536.13,Next please.,159,,
808,0.97,5536.13,5550.311,And there you get an idea where again--where the segment of the trail fits in with the overall Sdot plan to have the Georgetown to South Park connection trail.,160,,
809,0.97,5550.311,5550.945,"Please, please.",160,,
810,0.97,5550.945,5557.118,"Okay, we see a little building that seems to be sticking over the fence line and that is the encroachment.",160,,
811,0.97,5557.118,5559.086,It has been there for decades.,160,,
812,0.97,5559.086,5562.023,It is a total of 158 square feet.,160,,
813,0.97,5562.023,5568.029,Got to take care of it and get all the paperwork right.,160,,
814,0.97,5568.029,5568.329,Next please.,160,,
815,0.97,5568.329,5577.004,So we are proposing to Council that you authorize us to issue a temporary easement for the life of the building to King County.,160,,
816,0.97,5577.004,5589.483,"King County is going to be moving the fence that is not related back to the property line, taking care of that.",160,,
817,0.97,5589.483,5607.902,We are not going--we are for the--it is not our practice when these types of Situatons to ask the property owner to tear down a permanent structure.,160,,
818,0.97,5607.902,5608.569,"Next slide, please.",160,,
819,0.97,5608.569,5624.819,"Still attorney's office of course recommends that this ordinance be legislative prior to your consideration of the street vacation and the transfer of the property to parks, things get more complicated once property is transferred to parks about addressing these types of encroachments.",160,,
820,0.97,5624.819,5633.394,The future of property transfer would be subject to the terms of the temporary easement.,160,,
821,0.97,5633.394,5638.733,Last meeting there was a public hearing.,160,,
822,0.97,5638.733,5639.9,There were no commentators.,160,,
823,0.97,5639.9,5642.336,That has been taken care of.,160,,
824,0.97,5642.336,5648.209,The city council consideration would be this summer expected to be this summer.,160,,
825,0.97,5648.209,5650.277,And that is--next slide.,160,,
826,0.97,5650.277,5655.116,Basically any questions you might have,160,,
827,0.97,5655.116,5659.32,"Council members, any questions for this item?",161,,
828,0.97,5659.32,5659.52,Okay.,161,,
829,0.97,5659.52,5668.729,I know we will have more discussion later when we talk about the trail and it starts to come together.,161,,
830,0.97,5668.729,5669.263,"Council member, Strauss.",161,,
831,0.97,5669.263,5674.969,You have a question or Council member Herbold?,161,,
832,0.97,5674.969,5689.684,"Just signalling again Seattle city lights spent more time than I think they desired, bill and Tim appreciate all of the questions you answered for me about these properties and the adjacent properties.",162,,
833,0.97,5689.684,5706.701,It was very interesting to understand that these--this property is because the original steam plant that--was on the bank before the river was rerouted.,162,,
834,0.97,5706.701,5711.505,So--won't spend unnecessary amount of time talking about land use and land history in our area.,162,,
835,0.97,5711.505,5718.879,Just want to thank city light for spending so much time with me and answering all of my questions.,162,,
836,0.97,5718.879,5719.313,Thank you.,163,,
837,0.97,5719.313,5720.147,Council member Herbold.,163,,
838,0.97,5720.147,5723.217,Did you have a comment or question?,163,,
839,0.97,5723.217,5745.239,"Just wanted to extend my thanks as well for the work you are doing, for the work you are doing in bringing forward the necessary steps for this really important to both the Georgetown and the South Park communities projects.",164,,

866,0.97,5816.644,5820.714,Council members we do have a few items left.,179,,
867,0.97,5820.714,5834.962,We have LF item and then have got the rapid ride on Madison Street which will go quickly because it is just acceptance of a Federal grant and a couple of easements that are minor.,179,,

869,0.97,5846.307,5846.774,Lets keep going here.,179,,

873,0.97,5859.153,5869.43,An ordinance amending ordinance 126237 which adopted the 2021 budget including the 2021-2026 capital improvement program.,180,,
874,0.97,5869.43,5884.945,Changing appropriations within the transportation benefit district fund revising project allocations for certain projects in the 2021-2016C CIP for a brief discussion and possible vote.,180,,
875,0.97,5884.945,5887.581,Thank you.,181,,
876,0.97,5887.581,5900.094,Just a reminder city council approved the fee a few months ago.,181,,
877,0.97,5900.094,5915.609,I want to repeat my thank to the Seattle Department of Transportation for conducting that outreach and again to all of the people who participated in those--in those four plus meetings they had to discuss how to invest those dollars.,181,,
878,0.97,5915.609,5922.917,"Today our committee plans to vote on the proposal from s DOT, coin sill bill 120042.",181,,
879,0.97,5922.917,5925.019,That suggests how to invest the dollars.,181,,
880,0.97,5925.019,5939.066,Our committee had already heard and discussed this item as well as amendment what is called amendment number one from second Council members including myself that we sponsored and introduced a couple of weeks ago.,181,,
881,0.97,5939.066,5949.043,"S DOT's bill in front of us--we will hear from Calvin chow and also have a new amendment which we will discuss, amendment number two.",181,,
882,0.97,5949.043,5953.213,I think we will be able to take care of all of this today.,181,,
883,0.97,5953.213,5959.153,S DOT's bill in front of us proposes to divide the $7 million into six different categories.,181,,
884,0.97,5959.153,5962.623,We discussed it a couple of weeks ago.,181,,
885,0.97,5962.623,5981.275,Then amendment 1 asks s DOT to provide a list which could benefit if we chose to bond against vehicle licensees to generate more money faster.,181,,
886,0.97,5981.275,5985.012,We have gotten lots of E-Mails about this topic as well.,181,,
887,0.97,5985.012,5987.781,Thanks for taking the time to do that.,181,,
888,0.97,5987.781,5994.221,There appear to be some confusion and misinformation about the three page amendment number one.,181,,
889,0.97,5994.221,6005.699,It does not issue bonds but rather asks s DOT to come back with a list of projects which I think they should have--they should be putting this together anyway.,181,,
890,0.97,6005.699,6018.278,"The meat of that amendment, amendment number 1 would have them come back by September 30th so we can discuss it during budget process.",181,,
891,0.97,6018.278,6022.649,So as we know our state legislator accomplish add lot during the last four months.,181,,
892,0.97,6022.649,6026.987,They were not able to finish a transportation package.,181,,
893,0.97,6026.987,6031.191,We are hoping to get additional funds for the West Seattle bridge from that process.,181,,
894,0.97,6031.191,6057.251,"I believe this is further evidence that Seattle should consider going bigger and bolder now and getting s DOT to put together this list and present them to us in the bigger context of their $700 million budget that one of the speakers eluded to the fact that this--this stake holder process they went through could be used as a model for their entire budget, not just for the $7 million.",181,,
895,0.97,6057.251,6077.571,It was an unusual situation where this $7 million was created--authorized by us and then we wanted to--explore how to spend that quickly and it was put to this process and--I think it could benefit--s DOT could benefit from applying that lens through their entire budget.,181,,
896,0.97,6077.571,6083.944,If we have a list we could bond against work could discuss it all in the fall budget.,181,,
897,0.97,6083.944,6092.219,I think this is leading to a positive thing.,181,,
898,0.97,6092.219,6096.29,Amendment 1 was discussed at length.,181,,
899,0.97,6096.29,6099.693,It has been out there for a while.,181,,
900,0.97,6099.693,6131.058,"We do have central staff with us and also the sponsor of a new amendment, amendment number 2 which is Crafted by Council member Strauss and was circulated to the committee members and we will be discussing that and--I had a chance to look at that amendment number 2 and--I am viewing this as a--a relatively friendly amendment toward our overall efforts to Punctuate the priority of Seattle's aging infrastructure.",181,,
901,0.97,6131.058,6141.702,I'm pleased this is shaping up to be a collaborative legislative process among Council members which we try to achieve possible.,181,,
902,0.97,6141.702,6148.175,This will help lead to constructing transportation priorities we can all support.,181,,
903,0.97,6148.175,6161.321,I think any amendment that Prioritizes our aging infrastructure and considers how to leverage money faster is a strong step towards stronger bridges so we can address the alarming audit of our bridges.,181,,
904,0.97,6161.321,6176.003,"I think this amendment number 2 still successfully Intensifies our commitment towards safety and Sustainability of Multi-Bridges that connect our communities, and keep our community moving.",181,,
905,0.97,6176.003,6182.743,I will let Council member Strauss salespeople to this further.,181,,
906,0.97,6182.743,6185.279,"Calvin chow, did you want to introduce anything?",181,,
907,0.97,6185.279,6185.979,"No, Council members.",182,,
908,0.97,6185.979,6190.651,I will just be on hand to answer any questions.,182,,
909,0.97,6190.651,6190.884,Okay.,183,,
910,0.97,6190.884,6224.651,"I think what I would like to do is chair is--is to turn it over the council member Strauss so he can speak to amendment number 2 which--which takes parts of amendment 1 but--refines them and--targets them so Council member Strauss, why don't you go ahead and discuss your amendment and then we can make motions just--to talk about incorporating your amendment to--into the full council bill.",183,,
911,0.97,6224.651,6225.285,"Thank you, chair.",184,,
912,0.97,6225.285,6234.661,I want to thank everyone who has been working on amendment one and to all of the stake holders for their important work.,184,,
913,0.97,6234.661,6243.303,I want to highlight something I did here in public comment and that--I have been reviewing all of this has really stood out to me.,184,,
914,0.97,6243.303,6248.308,We have not updated our transit master plan since 2012.,184,,
915,0.97,6248.308,6258.752,This is the oldest plan in our--the transit master plan that we have on our books today does not include sound transit through.,184,,
916,0.97,6258.752,6266.26,So there are many neighborhoods within our transit master Flan are not included because we have not updated it.,184,,
917,0.97,6266.26,6272.933,Within the plan we have--it relies on high speed Trolleys.,184,,
918,0.97,6272.933,6273.667,I haven't seen one.,184,,
919,0.97,6273.667,6277.504,"If you know where one is, please let me know.",184,,
920,0.97,6277.504,6293.72,This highlights the importance that we need to update this plan because--sound transit is in the process of making decisions about the downtown tunnel which is 100 year rain from structure and we need to have that 100 year vision for our city.,184,,
921,0.97,6293.72,6295.889,The different master plan bag decade old.,184,,
922,0.97,6295.889,6299.426,"The decade that has occurred, Seattle has had the most growth since the gold rush.",184,,
923,0.97,6299.426,6304.698,So if we are not updating this plan we are setting ourselves up for failure.,184,,
924,0.97,6304.698,6313.907,"Speaking to my amendment number 2, I do want to again thank--thank all the stake holders who worked to create this spending plan.",184,,
925,0.97,6313.907,6317.911,We asked you provide us feedback on how we should spend this money.,184,,
926,0.97,6317.911,6331.958,You created a thoughtful plan that centers equity and services that all Seattle--[Indiscernible] it is a service people rely on.,184,,
927,0.97,6331.958,6342.669,There is no press release for a smooth drive or a rock chip that never happened because we filled the pot Theel could have bounced the rock off a truck bed into your win shield.,184,,
928,0.97,6342.669,6344.905,These are service we need.,184,,
929,0.97,6344.905,6348.275,These are services the stake holders--suggested we fund.,184,,
930,0.97,6348.275,6362.022,"Also make it known for the record, the importance I put on bridge maintenance repair and infrastructure investment to ensure that we have the connections for a while for buses, freight, bikes, pedestrians and cars.",184,,
931,0.97,6362.022,6372.232,This is my I started the corridor group has led to state funding and homely more state dollars in the written but not yet passed transportation package at the state legislator.,184,,
932,0.97,6372.232,6381.274,What I know is that we must dedicate city funding to the work of investing in our bridges.,184,,
933,0.97,6381.274,6383.176,That is matched by state and Federal dollars.,184,,
934,0.97,6383.176,6399.326,We need to have a more detailed understanding and we need to use this information to raise the correct amount of bonds at the right time to invest in our rain from structure Ratherthan taking on unneeded debt before we are ready to use it.,184,,
935,0.97,6399.326,6405.098,My tame on amendment 1 was that the only binding function of the amendment is positive.,184,,
936,0.97,6405.098,6422.015,Asking s DOT to provide a list of projects that could be funded by the source for any bonds and that the Non-Binding LING imagine where as set us up for failure by asking and setting bonding amounts before we know the scope of what we need to address.,184,,
937,0.97,6422.015,6431.825,Additionally the only binding section lacked requesting the schedule for projects and bond issuance.,184,,
938,0.97,6431.825,6438.999,"We know three most important words in projects are scope, schedule, budget.",184,,
939,0.97,6438.999,6448.408,Amendment 1 leads with a partial budget that asks for what should be driving this scope.,184,,
940,0.97,6448.408,6454.247,It asks us to raise bonds without knowing the scope schedule or full budget.,184,,
941,0.97,6454.247,6459.753,If this nonbinding language was acted on today we would raise bonds without shovel ready projects.,184,,
942,0.97,6459.753,6465.659,This means we would be be paying bankers interest on dollars we would not be ready to Sfoend day.,184,,
943,0.97,6465.659,6470.564,I heard these bonds could also pay for the planning documents.,184,,
944,0.97,6470.564,6482.542,To put in simple terms this would be doing taking out a home throne pay for our groceries.,184,,
945,0.97,6482.542,6488.982,These outstanding questions and known unknowns is why the nonbinding language does not set us up for success.,184,,
946,0.97,6488.982,6497.09,I want to raise up the intent--the intent of the offer authors of this amendment 1 is good intent.,184,,
947,0.97,6497.09,6501.127,We all want to know what our--bridge infrastructure needs are.,184,,
948,0.97,6501.127,6505.632,We all want to use every possible dollar to match state and Federal dollars.,184,,
949,0.97,6505.632,6519.045,We all want to ensure our bridges are ready to receive Federal investments and this is why my amendment 2 retains much of the Non-Binding language contained in amendment 1.,184,,
950,0.97,6519.045,6530.19,It contains the language that we support funding the stake holder plan for this year and the background about the urgency and need for bridge investment.,184,,
951,0.97,6530.19,6538.198,My amendment removes three clauses outlining the frame work of bonding.,184,,
952,0.97,6538.198,6547.741,It does replace those three clauses with the line--the Council may wish to consider bonding financing as part of the deliberations on the 2022 budget.,184,,
953,0.97,6547.741,6555.115,This is important because it does not--it still SETS us up to be able to bond if that is the right decision at the Rooem right time.,184,,
954,0.97,6555.115,6561.321,It SETS us up to still keep bonding as part of the conversation.,184,,
955,0.97,6561.321,6569.029,My amendment retains the only binding clause that we included in amendment 1 and it adds to it.,184,,
956,0.97,6569.029,6578.939,It adds this list should identify the anticipated schedule of capital expenditure by project to inform when bond issuance would be necessary.,184,,
957,0.97,6578.939,6587.347,This is critical because we need to know when we need to raise the bond otherwise we are Wising bonds and paying interest on dollars we can't spend.,184,,
958,0.97,6587.347,6595.989,I hope Te committee finds this amendment in the way I have proposed it.,184,,
959,0.97,6595.989,6612.238,It retains the binding aspect of amendment 1 which requires the information we need to make good decisions here at the city and that that information is shared with us in a timely fashion.,184,,
960,0.97,6612.238,6638.765,"And my amendment 2 keeps us on the paths path to raising the bonds we need to invest in our bridges that whether the fund--whatever the funding source is, whether it is Vlf, asks us for the important information we need to understand how many--how much bonding authority we need to raise to address these infrastructure investments.",184,,
961,0.97,6638.765,6645.105,"Because our bridges connect freight, buses, cars, bikes and pedestrians across our city.",184,,
962,0.97,6645.105,6653.546,"With that last comment separating our Fraths buses, cars, bikes and pedestrians, it should be clear each of us rely on freight.",184,,
963,0.97,6653.546,6658.385,If we go to the super market or anywhere we rely on freight.,184,,
964,0.97,6658.385,6664.758,Many of us use the bus and drive a car and ride a bike and walk places.,184,,
965,0.97,6664.758,6679.305,So outlining each of those different segments is not to separate people rather it is to demonstrate the bridges are a connection point for all of us and many of us use all of these different modes.,184,,
966,0.97,6679.305,6680.74,Thank you chair.,184,,
967,0.97,6680.74,6682.442,I hope I can earn everyone's support.,184,,
968,0.97,6682.442,6695.655,"Calvin, I don't know if you are able to share screen to show that amendment or if Council members have questions for Council member Strauss on amendment number 2.",185,,
969,0.97,6695.655,6709.135,I have got a--red line version that shows the changes between the previous amendment 1 and the proposed amendment 2.,186,,
970,0.97,6709.135,6710.637,Thank you.,187,,
971,0.97,6710.637,6740.366,"So Council member Strauss said he takes amendment 1, strips out some of the where as clauses which seem to signal more of a binding nature and then I believe added some additional requests to the meat of the amendment which is to talk about--have s DOT come back with a scheduling details as well.",187,,
972,0.97,6740.366,6764.19,So Council members I would encourage you to ask questions about amendment 2 which has because I think what we may do is just when I move the bill I will probably ask it to be amended by amendment 2 because it--just to skip over amendment 1.,187,,
973,0.97,6764.19,6777.804,I think that any amendment that Prioritizes Seattle's aging infrastructure is a strong step towards stronger bridges and other infrastructure.,187,,
974,0.97,6777.804,6780.874,I am very open to this.,187,,
975,0.97,6780.874,6782.976,Council member Herbold.,187,,
976,0.97,6782.976,6783.71,Thank you.,188,,
977,0.97,6783.71,6790.55,I just want to signal that um really appreciate Council member Strauss' E-mail.,188,,
978,0.97,6790.55,6815.008,"It captures the intent of amendment 1 by requiring up--project list from s DOT, asking for more information regarding the scheduled projects contained within the list and removes some--some Non-Binding language allowing us to be more flexible with our funding approaches.",188,,
979,0.97,6815.008,6847.874,It maintained what for me is--uh--a continuing to assist s DOT's work to implement the recommendations of the city auditor and want to thank s DOT for its work to going develop a strategic asset management plan for its bridges and--that we have heard about in previous meetings and--the recommendation that the city should develop and implement strategies to fill the bridge maintenance funding gap.,188,,
980,0.97,6847.874,6857.283,The auditor's report makes very clear that Seattle needs to increase investment in May I approach maintenance of our bridges.,188,,
981,0.97,6857.283,6869.028,"As I've spoken to before, a really glaring reason why this is needed is for the development of the next version of the move levy in a few years.",188,,
982,0.97,6869.028,6889.115,If recall the 2015 move levy was developed before the Council members in this meeting took office and it directed a much smaller proportion of funding to maintenance than the 20---Er to 2006 bridging the gap levy did.,188,,
983,0.97,6889.115,6924.55,This levy runs through 2024 so planning for the next levy will likely begin in 2023 and--it is really clear that we need an estimate of how much funding will be needed to maintain the bridges going into that discussion but we also need I believe a financing mechanism to do more now before the propose--the development and proposal of a future levy.,188,,
984,0.97,6924.55,6941.134,"Just--lifting up some quotes from the auditor's report, um--according to knowledgeable s DOT officials the city is not spending enough to keep its bridges in good condition and avoid costly repairs.",188,,
985,0.97,6941.134,6973.633,The audit reports the s DOT's interim roadway structures division director saying that based on the rate at which the condition of Seattle's bridges deteriorate the age of the bridges and the bridge's current replacement value s DOT estimates that the city's annual budge set far below what is needed to maintain all bridges in a state of good repair.,188,,
986,0.97,6973.633,6977.57,The estimated value is $3.4 billion.,188,,
987,0.97,6977.57,6987.58,According to the analysis done by the city auditors s DOT spent on average $6.6 million per year on bridge maintenance since 2006.,188,,
988,0.97,6987.58,6996.089,We need to be spending a minimum of $34 million a year.,188,,
989,0.97,6996.089,7016.342,"So, um--I am--[Indiscernible] to do a better job of funding bridge maintenance.",188,,
990,0.97,7016.342,7051.978,"I also want to signal the fact that we did hear from s DOT in the last year about the--the move levy project that have to be--had to be delayed specifically 16 bridge projects for seismic work, that there are five of those--those 16 projects that are high priority for seismic work were being delayed.",188,,
991,0.97,7051.978,7055.715,I think those are--for me high priority projects.,188,,
992,0.97,7055.715,7069.929,Both because they have already been identified as high priority projects but also because voters when they voted to pass the move levy did so with the understanding that that work would be done.,188,,
993,0.97,7069.929,7070.43,Thank you.,188,,
994,0.97,7070.43,7077.336,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",189,,

997,0.97,7079.205,7082.408,Thank you Council member Strauss for this amendment.,190,,
998,0.97,7082.408,7095.555,I think it goes a long way to addressing toward addressing some of the--Concernings I--concerns I have.,190,,
999,0.97,7095.555,7103.429,I want to thank s DOT on the important work they did engaging the community on a way that is different for them and wasn't an easy task.,190,,
1000,0.97,7103.429,7106.399,I think it is important to acknowledge work.,190,,
1001,0.97,7106.399,7121.514,"They engaged with folks who aren't traditional transportation or transit stake holders reached out to communities of color to low-income communities, to communities that don't speak English and all of that is really important to honor.",190,,
1002,0.97,7121.514,7132.859,One of the things I hear a lot from community is that the city asked them to engage and spend a lot of time in community meetings and then recommendations get ignored.,190,,
1003,0.97,7132.859,7135.127,So--so I don't want to do that.,190,,
1004,0.97,7135.127,7144.67,If we will ask people for their time we need to respect their lived experience and what they are offering to the city.,190,,
1005,0.97,7144.67,7148.774,That I also acknowledge that we are a city surrounded by water.,190,,
1006,0.97,7148.774,7158.618,We need our bridges to be in good working order and so my hope is we don't see these two things as mutually exclusive.,190,,
1007,0.97,7158.618,7168.261,We need bridge maintenance and we need to be moving toward our vision 0 goals for pedestrian safety.,190,,
1008,0.97,7168.261,7174.6,I want to make a couple of notes about the auditor's report.,190,,
1009,0.97,7174.6,7178.07,It did site the $34 million bridge maintenance.,190,,
1010,0.97,7178.07,7211.337,That figure is an estimate based on 1%--[Indiscernible] the report does recommend that s DOT s--develops a strategic bridge program.,190,,
1011,0.97,7211.337,7219.378,"I think it is worth asking for that list, asking for information about where we need to make investments.",190,,
1012,0.97,7219.378,7226.252,I think it is important we give s DOT the time to do that.,190,,
1013,0.97,7226.252,7235.995,So my hope is that--the September Timeline we have here is--at least a marker for when we would expect to see something like that.,190,,
1014,0.97,7235.995,7249.942,I do think it is also important not to constrain us as Council to making a decision about bonding when we aren't sure whether that list be ready.,190,,
1015,0.97,7249.942,7255.748,"And if it is, whether there would be anything on it that we can bond for.",190,,
1016,0.97,7255.748,7278.504,"So, I want to thank my colleagues for raising the issue, for thinking Proactively about how we can be Strategizing for bridge investment and--and for being willing to not sort of box us in to a particular kind of financing mechanism till we have more information.",190,,
1017,0.97,7278.504,7286.078,Thanks to chair Pedersen and Council member Strauss for your work.,190,,

1135,0.97,7999.291,8000.292,That finally happened April 5.,229,,
1136,0.97,8000.292,8009.634,We are now working with the FTA to finalize the small starts agreement for execution.,229,,

1144,0.97,8059.751,8062.354,Construction would start in September.,229,,
1145,0.97,8062.354,8066.124,This is along a large project complicated.,229,,
1146,0.97,8066.124,8084.876,It is about 2.5 years of construction outreach both to prepare the community and stake holders for construction is important as well as keeping people informed during construction so they know ahead of time when for example an intersection will be closed.,229,,
1147,0.97,8084.876,8095.72,More specifically to property owners where we are going to be having to impact access to a garage when that will happen and how we can manage traffic and access for them during construction.,229,,

1157,0.97,8126.785,8147.339,I will not and the questions that I had about how can we make more improvements to increase reliability because we know that for us to be able to rely on our transit network we need to be able to rely that the buses will arrive in a regular amount of time and we have the same amount of travel time Eve time we are on the bus to get where we are going.,231,,
1158,0.97,8147.339,8158.483,"I want to take this moment to highlight the--that the extent of this project is so large because it is more than a transit project, it is a water sewer, electrical.",231,,

1264,0.97,8614.539,8630.121,Because we need to provide sufficient time for review by our city attorney's office including whether any amendments to SPD Technologies would have a material impact on the Federal consent decree.,271,,

1274,0.97,8669.961,8671.029,Good morning.,274,,
1275,0.97,8671.029,8676.734,I am with the Seattle information technology Department depth to discuss the group three surveillance reports as introduced.,274,,
1276,0.97,8676.734,8678.136,We can hit the next slide.,274,,
1277,0.97,8678.136,8686.177,Just to give a quick over view we have been working on this project since 2017 when that amended surveillance ordinance took effect.,274,,
1278,0.97,8686.177,8699.357,I won't run through the whole back story but as you see we have come to this committee several times in this last year alone really moving forward on getting these retroactive reviews of these Technologies completed and approved.,274,,
1279,0.97,8699.357,8707.865,So as mentioned we just went through the group 2 Technologies.,274,,
1280,0.97,8707.865,8713.004,Now we will be moving ton group 3 Technologies specifically from the Seattle police Department.,274,,
1281,0.97,8713.004,8724.215,So in this grouping of three bills I will Introdce really quickly--discuss.,274,,
1282,0.97,8724.215,8739.497,"I also wanted to acknowledge that you will see in the next grouping, group 4A there is a couple of Technologies there that are undergoing the public review period now.",274,,
1283,0.97,8739.497,8744.769,Those are up on the Website if you want to take a look and get a preview of what is going on for group 4.,274,,
1284,0.97,8744.769,8752.176,We are opening the public engage for a moment that now.,274,,
1285,0.97,8752.176,8765.656,Public engage element--engagement will be completed later this summer.,274,,
1286,0.97,8765.656,8767.125,I want to highlight the public engagement.,274,,
1287,0.97,8767.125,8770.094,That was the last piece of the process we do.,274,,
1288,0.97,8770.094,8775.133,This took place in the latter end of 2020.,274,,
1289,0.97,8775.133,8778.669,In October we had an Online public engagement event.,274,,
1290,0.97,8778.669,8789.714,This is the first grouping we had in Online public engagement event due to the Covid-19 pandemic.,274,,
1291,0.97,8789.714,8807.665,"We did kind of utilize some of the same methods having an Online survey, having an Inbox opened to receive E-Mails or letters and then having that public meeting where the Department presents and the public has an opportunity to provide comment or ask questions.",274,,
1292,0.97,8807.965,8859.15,"As we will be conducting group four Online we will be doing making some modifications including hosting more than one event, at different times of the day so folks are able to attend those different meetings and then also make sure they are posted Online a little bit quicker than they were.",274,,
1293,0.97,8859.15,8870.127,I believe they got posted right at the end of the public engagement period for group three.,274,,
1294,0.97,8870.127,8871.262,These getting into something more sensitive Technologies.,274,,
1295,0.97,8871.262,8876.534,With that--that is a quick over view of the public engagement and the Technologies.,274,,
1296,0.97,8876.534,8889.18,If there are no questions I will hand it over to captain.,274,,
1297,0.97,8889.18,8889.747,Thank you.,275,,
1298,0.97,8889.747,8889.981,Welcome,275,,
1299,0.97,8889.981,8893.784,Thank you.,276,,
1300,0.97,8893.784,8897.655,Thanks for that quick introduction and over view of everything.,276,,
1301,0.97,8897.655,8900.858,I want to make sure I answer any questions that might come up.,276,,
1302,0.97,8900.858,8915.373,"Obviously the mission is to prevent crime and enforce the law but really support quality public safety that deliver a respectful, dependable police services and as you know--its quite honestly what we are trying to do each and everyday.",276,,
1303,0.97,8915.373,8918.075,I think the troops do a good job of that.,276,,
1304,0.97,8918.075,8926.083,Obviously there is also some over sight I will mention as we go through some of these that--play into maintaining the high standard.,276,,
1305,0.97,8926.083,8928.119,Go ahead and go to the next slide.,276,,
1306,0.97,8928.119,8928.352,Sorry.,276,,
1307,0.97,8928.352,8929.487,Didn't mean to catch you off guard.,276,,
1308,0.97,8929.487,8942.4,The first one I would like talk about is the forward looking infrared.,276,,
1309,0.97,8942.4,8954.712,The next only talk about will be the Situational awareness cameras.,276,,
1310,0.97,8954.712,8955.179,"Oh, okay.",276,,
1311,0.97,8955.179,8960.251,We will go ahead and go to the next slide for forward looking infrared.,276,,
1312,0.97,8960.251,8978.336,What it is is--King County has helicopters with the forward looking infrared camera on it and it sends Realtime Video to the ground and it uses a Video link to send it to the system.,276,,
1313,0.97,8978.336,9001.792,If they are flying and they can get there N time--they have the ability to respond--in the event someone on scene says--[Indiscernible] that request is reviewed by a supervisor.,276,,
1314,0.97,9001.792,9005.696,There is a little bit of over sight there.,276,,
1315,0.97,9005.696,9007.264,Why do we use this technology?,276,,
1316,0.97,9007.264,9014.705,Quite honestly that aerial view is very beneficial to provide information to understand what is really happening out in the field.,276,,
1317,0.97,9014.705,9032.59,"Obviously if it is a natural disaster, crime scenes or missing person, search and rescue for us or a fire, that information of where they may or may not be able to see activity and I will talk about how they--or how they see and it how we might be able to get the evidence in a second.",276,,
1318,0.97,9032.59,9042.566,That bird's eye view takes in the big picture of what is going on so to speak.,276,,
1319,0.97,9042.566,9046.804,What it does is its a thermal imagery.,276,,
1320,0.97,9046.804,9047.605,It identifies heat sources.,276,,
1321,0.97,9047.605,9050.941,The human body gives off heat.,276,,
1322,0.97,9050.941,9054.278,They are able to detect that.,276,,
1323,0.97,9054.278,9059.95,You will be able to see that in the next slide.,276,,
1324,0.97,9060.251,9079.837,"On the far right it shows the human shade kind of an out lie, et cetera.",276,,
1325,0.97,9079.837,9086.043,The middle gun we could zoom in on that a little bit is two people hiding behind cars.,276,,
1326,0.97,9086.043,9090.347,There is really not much more than heat signature there.,276,,
1327,0.97,9090.347,9090.948,Nothing really identifiable.,276,,
1328,0.97,9090.948,9094.652,The one on the far left is a distant shot.,276,,
1329,0.97,9094.652,9099.957,A subject on the far side between two buildings that they are looking for.,276,,
1330,0.97,9099.957,9109.6,"So, what it is is--King County was able to secure these through some funding and--they offered to support for the region.",276,,
1331,0.97,9109.6,9115.172,As such King--Guardian one isn't readily available for just SPD.,276,,
1332,0.97,9115.172,9117.274,They have their own flights schedules et cetera.,276,,
1333,0.97,9117.274,9123.113,It was brought up later--earlier but I will talk about it now that it may be disproportionately applied.,276,,
1334,0.97,9123.113,9127.718,We will be able to talk about some of those numbers.,276,,
1335,0.97,9127.718,9138.729,"It really is contingent upon whether they are in the air, what the crime is and if it is approved and can they get there in time to support us.",276,,
1336,0.97,9138.729,9153.577,"The crimes we use it for for the most part are robberies, vehicle pursuits because it is much safer to pursue from the air and not have the vehicles close behind them, wait for them to stop and try to apprehend them.",276,,
1337,0.97,9153.577,9158.449,We do a lot with search and rescue.,276,,
1338,0.97,9158.449,9193.484,"One case they had recovered and I dent Guyed a couple of kids--it is just--it registers heat that is available to the eye, the human eye which we can't register but this camera can.",276,,
1339,0.97,9193.484,9199.59,"So, go ahead and go to the next one.",276,,
1340,0.97,9199.59,9202.66,These are all policies that governments use.,276,,
1341,0.97,9202.66,9203.627,Spd has very strict policies.,276,,
1342,0.97,9203.627,9207.398,Those are audited by the office of Inspector general.,276,,
1343,0.97,9207.398,9215.673,Internally to the SPD that we can--we can look at those ourselves and make sure we are doing and it major incidents are reviewed by staff.,276,,
1344,0.97,9215.673,9220.177,If there is any inappropriate actions or Deployments that can take care of that.,276,,
1345,0.97,9220.177,9234.358,The--the issue I talked about earlier regarding Deployments we supplied one year in 2018 for Deployments with Guardian one we were able to identify occurred within the city.,276,,
1346,0.97,9234.358,9240.531,People were saying there was a large amount.,276,,
1347,0.97,9240.531,9250.407,"It depends where the crime occurs, whether Guardian one is in the air and if there are resources that will benefit us.",276,,
1348,0.97,9250.708,9263.22,Almost three times as many than the other precinct.,276,,
1349,0.97,9263.22,9265.356,In 2020 Southwest precinct had more.,276,,
1350,0.97,9265.356,9268.559,"So, obviously during Covid 2020 we had less calls for service.",276,,
1351,0.97,9268.559,9276.333,It still is showing that it really depends where the crime occurs and then the availability of Guardian one to be available to deploy to support our efforts.,276,,
1352,0.97,9276.634,9303.794,Situational awareness cameras that do not record.,277,,
1353,0.97,9303.794,9310.467,That's a remotely operating vehicle.,277,,
1354,0.97,9310.467,9315.773,They go inside a residence.,277,,
1355,0.97,9315.773,9323.714,"The only go inside when there are circumstances, a safety issue and no other way to get in if there's a threat to human life.",277,,
1356,0.97,9323.714,9325.516,And/or they have a search warrant.,277,,
1357,0.97,9325.516,9332.356,If there's a Barricaded person or hostage situation.,277,,
1358,0.97,9332.356,9335.125,"Hostage situation, Thomas, try to secure a search warrant even before it's resolved.",277,,
1359,0.97,9335.125,9347.037,"Even knowing the Hostas situation appears to be deteriorating, we can take immediate safety action to protect the lives of the people inside.",277,,
1360,0.97,9347.037,9354.645,The other thing is it protects the subjects inside.,277,,
1361,0.97,9354.645,9356.547,"If we know where they are, we can call them out.",277,,
1362,0.97,9356.547,9361.518,"Hey, you, you need to, side and talked to was.",277,,
1363,0.97,9361.518,9369.56,"It lets us set a stage to allow for successful surrender and allows, to protect themselves in the event that the subject is inside.",277,,
1364,0.97,9369.56,9375.232,Waiting with a fire and for someone to come inside.,277,,
1365,0.97,9375.232,9376.667,This gives early warning and we can avoid that.,277,,
1366,0.97,9376.667,9383.474,"Often times we use these to talk to the individual and yell at them and say we see you behind the sofa, why don't you come out.",277,,
1367,0.97,9383.474,9386.577,That makes it safer for everyone including --,277,,
1368,0.97,9386.577,9394.551,There's Situational awareness cameras that do not record on these.,278,,
1369,0.97,9394.551,9396.253,The next slide will show a couple different things.,278,,
1370,0.97,9396.253,9405.496,"In terms of that, the cold Cam on the right is the camera on the end of a stick that comes back to the monitor.",278,,
1371,0.97,9405.496,9409.199,There's a slot to be able to record but it's not utilized by SPD.,278,,
1372,0.97,9409.199,9413.904,We don't record that and the same with the Rop.,278,,
1373,0.97,9413.904,9421.111,"It doesn't have the capability to record, some do, but some do not but this one does not.",278,,
1374,0.97,9421.111,9422.246,We have ones we can throw inside.,278,,
1375,0.97,9422.246,9423.881,Those are recorded either.,278,,
1376,0.97,9423.881,9429.219,They send an image.,278,,
1377,0.97,9429.219,9430.988,We are deliberately not trying to collect data we don't need.,278,,
1378,0.97,9430.988,9437.628,We are trying to find out on a life safety issue if we can do it.,278,,
1379,0.97,9437.628,9444.401,These can be utilized from everything from a Barricaded person or hostage situation.,278,,
1380,0.97,9444.401,9446.47,Some jurisdictions they use to support search and rescue in unusual Venues.,278,,
1381,0.97,9446.47,9454.144,"A kid is trapped, see if there behind debris or something, they can be utilized for that.",278,,
1382,0.97,9454.144,9456.413,Those are the things we do there.,278,,
1383,0.97,9456.413,9465.155,I think that's the end.,278,,
1384,0.97,9465.155,9469.059,There is the same policy in place.,278,,
1385,0.97,9469.059,9477.668,The Office of Inspector General has open access to the information to the Deployments and what we have retained for different cases.,278,,
1386,0.97,9477.668,9481.839,They have the ability to look in there and complete a thorough audit.,278,,
1387,0.97,9481.839,9485.576,That is in there.,278,,
1388,0.97,9485.576,9489.479,I will go on to the next one for the sake of time.,278,,
1389,0.97,9489.479,9499.69,I'm sorry?,278,,
1390,0.97,9499.69,9501.258,"We will do the third technology now, thank you.",279,,
1391,0.97,9501.258,9505.062,These are the Video recording systems we have within this Seattle police Department facilities.,280,,
1392,0.97,9505.062,9517.608,"In those areas with contact with those under arrest, they may be detained such as juveniles or physical arrest.",280,,
1393,0.97,9517.608,9519.81,We have camera systems in different places.,280,,
1394,0.97,9519.81,9524.114,The Breathalyzer processing room or public room.,280,,
1395,0.97,9524.114,9525.315,Then the lineup rooms.,280,,
1396,0.97,9525.315,9532.89,This technology is designed as a safety precaution.,280,,
1397,0.97,9532.89,9533.523,They are fixed cameras.,280,,
1398,0.97,9533.523,9535.025,You can't zoom them.,280,,
1399,0.97,9535.025,9550.207,That information goes to a server we will talk about in a second the records for a specific period of time.,280,,
1400,0.97,9550.207,9555.045,This is a checks and balance for community to know the officers aren't doing anything they shouldn't be doing in these areas when the subject is in custody.,280,,
1401,0.97,9555.045,9567.224,"It's much like body worn cameras and the Video that videos the Backseat so it's--of force, we can say yes or no to that allegation.",280,,
1402,0.97,9567.224,9569.326,"On the left, it says it prevents disputes on how interviews are conducted.",280,,
1403,0.97,9569.326,9582.706,It's trying to be as transparent as we legally can in terms of interactions with subjects that are in custody.,280,,
1404,0.97,9582.706,9587.878,"As it says, it enhances the accountability because it's recorded.",280,,
1405,0.97,9587.878,9589.746,"If it's going to a case, goes into the case file.",280,,
1406,0.97,9589.746,9596.353,"If there's a complete, the police accountability and office of Inspector general have access to it.",280,,
1407,0.97,9596.353,9602.693,This is an where that was addressed as Councilmember Pedersen said by the Department of justice . next slide please.,280,,
1408,0.97,9602.693,9607.197,We have two different systems.,281,,
1409,0.97,9607.197,9610.3,The Den Tech Video system is an hour area.,281,,
1410,0.97,9610.3,9617.674,They do small rooms where we bring someone in and interview them in relation to a crime.,281,,
1411,0.97,9617.674,9622.079,That is retained as evidence.,281,,
1412,0.97,9622.079,9629.119,It follows case law and state law and in some cases Federal law.,281,,
1413,0.97,9629.119,9631.188,In terms of who gets access to it and who doesn't.,281,,
1414,0.97,9631.188,9638.128,"Basically, for us, if you're not involved in the case, you can't you don't get to see the independence.",281,,
1415,0.97,9638.128,9645.802,"It sent to the Prosecutor's office after charges were fled, it could become public information, but it is part of the case and therefore legal for us to record.",281,,
1416,0.97,9645.802,9653.21,"In the holding cells, the processing area and the receiving room, we use Video management system.",281,,
1417,0.97,9653.21,9657.647,These are fixed cameras.,281,,
1418,0.97,9657.647,9659.716,That information is retained on site for a short period of time.,281,,
1419,0.97,9659.716,9662.152,Then it's put in the file.,281,,
1420,0.97,9662.152,9675.665,"With that, these cameras have done everything I was personally involved with where the subject had secured a Firearm and tried to kick it into the corner of a holding cell.",281,,
1421,0.97,9675.665,9676.233,That became evidence.,281,,
1422,0.97,9676.233,9681.371,"It is available for Oig, OPA, and prosecution and defense.",281,,
1423,0.97,9681.371,9688.378,Everyone has access when it's used for case files are for a complaint.,281,,
1424,0.97,9688.378,9692.783,"The Signage you see on the right-hand side, can you go back one?",281,,
1425,0.97,9692.783,9694.451,It's currently out there.,281,,
1426,0.97,9694.451,9700.657,It's in English and it says videos in progress.,281,,
1427,0.97,9700.657,9705.796,"I checked on the status, and we are exploring which languages and had to put it up there.",281,,
1428,0.97,9705.796,9717.607,Hopefully he can use visual Graphics to say there is Video and Audio processing in that area so those under arrest understand that.,281,,
1429,0.97,9717.607,9725.515,"More often than not, the officers, the young officers are so Tech savvy they remember to say it's Video recorded the whole time you were here.",281,,
1430,0.97,9725.515,9729.886,"If not, then the signs posted will be and more languages.",281,,
1431,0.97,9729.886,9731.188,That was brought up in a community meeting.,281,,
1432,0.97,9731.188,9733.323,I have been told that should be coming out soon.,281,,
1433,0.97,9733.323,9740.63,Next slide.,281,,
1434,0.97,9740.63,9742.799,This expense what we are doing.,282,,
1435,0.97,9742.799,9751.942,It's put to a Court-Approved CD and retained on the device.,282,,
1436,0.97,9751.942,9758.048,There is only one master detective that has access to be able to Delete them.,282,,
1437,0.97,9758.048,9762.652,They can't get access once burned to the CD and those are deleted after 90 days.,282,,
1438,0.97,9762.652,9768.658,"In terms of the milestone, in accordance with the law, milestone is a little longer.",282,,
1439,0.97,9768.658,9781.438,"It's longer because the office of police accountability, DOJ monitoring team, wanted to be able to hold that Video the police civilian interactions longer in case there's a complaint.",282,,
1440,0.97,9781.438,9784.975,That is the ability to check it.,282,,
1441,0.97,9784.975,9789.546,"As you see, minimum of 120 days.",282,,
1442,0.97,9789.546,9791.381,Maximum 217 days if used in evidence.,282,,
1443,0.97,9791.381,9799.623,"If it's been flagged for, like the gentleman that tried to slide a gun, we will retain that and is kept a little longer.",282,,
1444,0.97,9799.623,9805.162,Those are the retention time lines for the video.,282,,
1445,0.97,9805.162,9807.697,Next slide please.,282,,
1446,0.97,9807.697,9809.065,Those are the policies.,283,,
1447,0.97,9809.065,9811.968,They are in there.,283,,
1448,0.97,9811.968,9821.111,Our policies are updated by the DOJ agreement.,283,,
1449,0.97,9821.111,9825.315,Those are very strict as to who access them and who doesn't and when and where it shall be done.,283,,
1450,0.97,9825.315,9828.385,"We don't have objection to it, but we didn't have a lot of insight into what.",283,,
1451,0.97,9828.385,9835.225,They said this is what we think you need to fix and we did that.,283,,
1452,0.97,9835.225,9837.394,We do cloud storage and we follow the city of Seattle I.T.,283,,
1453,0.97,9837.394,9838.428,It works closely with city I.T.,283,,
1454,0.97,9838.428,9844.301,And they do a great job protecting our data.,283,,
1455,0.97,9844.301,9846.803,"In terms of that, I would have to refer technical questions to city I.T.",283,,
1456,0.97,9846.803,9849.306,And give them a heads up.,283,,
1457,0.97,9849.306,9855.345,"I think the next one, were you going to covered dish okay.",283,,
1458,0.97,9855.345,9861.651,Any questions?,283,,
1459,0.97,9861.651,9867.123,"Council members, we can also, we can ask questions not the captain or I.T.",284,,
1460,0.97,9867.123,9870.26,Or lease can go through her memos.,284,,
1461,0.97,9870.26,9875.131,Which ever you would like.,284,,

1464,0.97,9889.246,9890.747,Is that correct?,285,,
1465,0.97,9890.747,9911.735,"I think there might be an opportunity with Lisa going through recommendations for us to, at that point, ask captain McDonough with the proposed policies say about those recommendations and confirm that we are not receiving recommendations.",285,,
1466,0.97,9911.735,9920.11,That the Department has anticipated and included its proposed policies.,285,,
1467,0.97,9920.11,9920.477,Will said.,286,,

1475,0.97,9947.337,9950.64,Next slide.,287,,
1476,0.97,9950.64,9960.183,"The three bills, the committee asked for, you would approve the continued use and accept the search for these Technologies.",287,,
1477,0.97,9960.183,9969.459,The committee will be asked to act on the May 19 meeting and the chair requested members get proposed amendments to me by May 10.,287,,
1478,0.97,9969.459,9979.769,I will briefly review the survey lists impact reports Refill very quickly and I will pause for questions after the summary of each [Indiscernible - low volume]. Let's go ahead to the next bill.,287,,
1479,0.97,9979.769,9986.142,Skip to slide four if you don't mind.,287,,
1480,0.97,9986.142,9990.38,Let's jump to this one.,287,,
1481,0.97,9990.38,9993.984,And talk about the technology.,287,,
1482,0.97,9993.984,10015.105,"This forward looking real-time Video technology is abbreviated, as captain Mcdonagh mentioned this technology produces thermal images from devices installed in the sheriffs helicopters that help locate or track people on the ground.",287,,
1483,0.97,10015.105,10023.413,Let's go to slide six.,287,,
1484,0.97,10023.413,10025.682,The surveillance working group has flagged several issues with this technology.,288,,
1485,0.97,10025.682,10042.799,"Including the need for policies that define allowable uses of the technology, the need for policies pertaining to data collection and storage, concern about privacy impacts on people who were not related to the investigation, and the lack of historical data.",288,,
1486,0.97,10042.799,10054.611,I would note the chief technology officer did find the surge addresses these concerns and did provide the 2018 data that captain Mcdonagh mentioned.,288,,
1487,0.97,10054.611,10069.259,The captain also noted the 2019 and reference the 2019 and 2020 data I sent to you earlier this week that does show the distribution of deployment doesn't seem to be concentrated in the particular precinct.,288,,
1488,0.97,10069.259,10072.929,Councilmember Herbold.,289,,
1489,0.97,10072.929,10074.964,Thank you.,290,,
1490,0.97,10074.964,10081.871,The response is Sir generally addresses each concern.,290,,
1491,0.97,10081.871,10085.575,"I want to, done on that.",290,,
1492,0.97,10085.575,10087.777,I don't know but generally means.,290,,
1493,0.97,10087.777,10110.7,I think one recommendation is that the ordinance of the Council adopt in the ordinance language that makes it clear that the use of the technology is restricted to the defined specific purpose and allowable uses.,290,,
1494,0.97,10110.7,10115.805,Just want to confirm that the proposal does there.,290,,
1495,0.97,10115.805,10129.419,It says that there must be policies in place to ensure that these Technologies are not being used disproportionately Surveilling communities of color.,290,,
1496,0.97,10129.419,10136.159,Want to confirm that the proposal addresses that issue.,290,,
1497,0.97,10136.159,10152.108,"Thirdly, there's a requirement, or there's a question whether or not there's a requirement to Redact or Delete information collected that may compromise the privacy of individuals.",290,,
1498,0.97,10152.108,10169.859,"With your permission, I will speak to the uses and introduce the notion of policies about the dispersion of proportionality and requirement to Delete extraneous information or individuals who are not part of an investigation.",291,,
1499,0.97,10169.859,10186.543,The allowable uses of the technology are Cataloged in the executive overview which Council will be adopting . that document constitutes the operational policies that define how each of these Technologies can be used.,291,,
1500,0.97,10186.543,10200.29,"The notion, I will mention that the policies that restrict disproportionate surveillance really are found in the policies about bias [Indiscernible - low volume].",291,,
1501,0.97,10200.29,10216.573,"The requirement to Delete information, that is not related to the investigation and, would have to ask that to Captain Mcdonagh.",291,,
1502,0.97,10216.573,10219.909,"If they don't know off the top of their head, we will get back to you.",291,,
1503,0.97,10219.909,10224.714,I do know we do not retain anything that doesn't relate directly to the crime.,292,,
1504,0.97,10224.714,10228.818,I can't quote you the points but we can get there.,292,,
1505,0.97,10228.818,10231.554,We don't retain it because it's not evidence.,292,,
1506,0.97,10231.554,10239.729,We would not keep it and it would follow the normal disposition of information.,292,,
1507,0.97,10239.729,10252.342,"If I may add, for my understanding the use of the evidence collected from this technology, it's not--SP doesn't have a dump of data.",293,,
1508,0.97,10252.342,10267.123,They request a specific Timeframe from Kane County related to investigation or a crime that they will see can you--was Guardian one in the air this time?,293,,
1509,0.97,10267.123,10268.491,Do you have evidence from 1800 hours to 1830?,293,,
1510,0.97,10268.491,10288.945,That would be captured as evidence on SPD behalf but Kane County maintains a lot of the data and decides if they have information to provide to SPD if that helps.,293,,
1511,0.97,10288.945,10292.148,I guess my question is about what is retained by SPD?,294,,
1512,0.97,10292.148,10311.1,And or what length of time of information is not useful to a specific investigation or a specific search.,294,,
1513,0.97,10311.1,10318.308,I also have a question about the sequencing of the recommendations we get from the Workgroup?,294,,
1514,0.97,10318.308,10327.917,"Are those recommendations coming after the proposal, the proposed language, or is it beforehand?",294,,
1515,0.97,10327.917,10347.837,"If it's coming after, there seems to be a Disconnect from work group on what is, how feedback has been incorporated in the proposed language.",294,,
1516,0.97,10347.837,10361.017,"The draft Sir documents provided for public comment outlining, since his arrest director, how the Technologies being used.",295,,
1517,0.97,10361.017,10366.322,What are the policies and procedures around the use of the technology.,295,,
1518,0.97,10366.322,10374.497,"Wants the public comment is completed, that bundle is provided to the working group to provide their assessment on do they find the policies adequate?",295,,
1519,0.97,10374.497,10383.673,Whatever recommendations they would make the nest provided back to Cto to respond to the recommendations and say we believe this has been addressed in policy or has no.,295,,
1520,0.97,10383.673,10397.987,I believe that is what Lisa outlines in her staff memo about what is the current policy?,295,,
1521,0.97,10397.987,10398.421,What's recommended?,295,,
1522,0.97,10398.421,10403.459,"And how does Cto feel it's been addressed in the Sir through the operational policies, if that makes sense.",295,,
1523,0.97,10403.459,10404.293,Thinking of the last group.,296,,
1524,0.97,10404.293,10412.101,My recollection is the response we got for everything was Sir addresses each concern.,296,,
1525,0.97,10412.101,10435.725,"We found out subsequently the working group did not feel that the server addressed the concerns, particularly, we made significant requests to the Department changes around retention of recordings.",296,,
1526,0.97,10435.725,10450.44,"I am having a hard time understanding, how do we find out how the working group really feels about what has been proposed?",296,,
1527,0.97,10450.44,10459.749,"I would mention for this particular technology that is an instance, if you could show slide seven, the policy considerations.",297,,
1528,0.97,10459.749,10484.273,"I did note the policies explain how an officer can request your support and this is an issue flagged by the working group, the policies don't specify types of incident for which officers are allowed to request your support or use the technology.",297,,
1529,0.97,10484.273,10514.17,"The information, I basically am looking at what the working group has said and the chief technology officer has said, and basically Flaking issues for Council where, and my professional judgment, the working groups recommendations haven't been addressed.",297,,
1530,0.97,10514.17,10515.104,That is super helpful.,298,,
1531,0.97,10515.104,10515.705,Thank you so much.,298,,
1532,0.97,10515.705,10517.807,If I may one more thing on this one?,298,,
1533,0.97,10517.807,10521.477,Yes.,299,,
1534,0.97,10521.477,10537.293,"When I asked the question about the use of this technology disproportionately servile communities of color, Lisa, think you mentioned the city Anti-Bias policing policies.",300,,
1535,0.97,10537.293,10552.108,My recollection is those policies were flagged on the next technology but they were not flagged as being relevant to this technology.,300,,
1536,0.97,10552.108,10571.761,"I don't have that particular slide in front of me, but that is what I remember seeing is the bias free policing policies were named specifically for the Situational awareness technology but not named for this one.",300,,
1537,0.97,10571.761,10590.579,It was Referenced in the Toolkit section of the Sir . We can check back again and make sure that's true.,301,,
1538,0.97,10590.579,10603.859,Your first question was do we keep information about potential third parties.,302,,
1539,0.97,10603.859,10607.797,"If it's Evidentiary and something on the side, by law, there's a bunch of rules we are required to keep it.",302,,
1540,0.97,10607.797,10616.105,"Defense can use it to say they are, it wasn't the one comments over here.",302,,
1541,0.97,10616.105,10616.605,Something like that.,302,,
1542,0.97,10616.605,10627.783,"In terms of that, we are careful not to take anything we don't think is Evidentiary but if it becomes evident Cherry we retain it with the case file.",302,,
1543,0.97,10627.783,10664.62,"My question isn't if it's Evidentiary, if you end up with it, because, maybe, I understand you are saying you are limiting what you are getting from the third-party two things that are related to a specific investigation or search but I'm thinking there might be, tell me I'm wrong if this never happens, but there could be a situation when you request it you think it is related or could be related to a specific investigation or search and you determined that it does not, that it's not related.",303,,
1544,0.97,10664.62,10674.53,With a understanding that there absolutely are requirements for you to hold onto that information that is related.,303,,
1545,0.97,10674.53,10683.072,"I think a case where there may be something in there but to be honest, it's pretty rare.",304,,
1546,0.97,10683.072,10693.949,We would have to work with the prosecutors and make sure the legal standards are met to make sure we are not getting rid of evidence that potentially could preclude somebody from being charge.,304,,
1547,0.97,10693.949,10696.285,Stop them from being unjustly charge.,304,,
1548,0.97,10696.285,10703.993,"In terms of that, we follow case law and state laws, right?",304,,
1549,0.97,10703.993,10709.999,"In terms of that, I think there are protections in place.",304,,
1550,0.97,10709.999,10713.602,You have to understand we answer to those other entities and therefore we are required to follow them.,304,,
1551,0.97,10713.602,10717.506,"Thank you, Captain.",305,,
1552,0.97,10717.506,10733.722,Let's go ahead to slide eight . The second technology . The Situational awareness cameras without recording as captain Mcdonagh mentioned.,306,,
1553,0.97,10733.722,10739.128,'s are used to get images from safe distances.,306,,
1554,0.97,10739.128,10742.832,Let's go to slide 10 if you would.,306,,
1555,0.97,10742.832,10754.543,"For these cameras, Situational, I'm sorry, focus on the language for allowable uses.",306,,
1556,0.97,10754.543,10759.348,That is Cataloged in the executive overview.,306,,
1557,0.97,10759.348,10769.658,The desire to prohibit from using cameras that have facial recognition and recording into safer safeguards against Downloading or streaming images of the cameras to devices.,306,,
1558,0.97,10769.658,10787.777,"Chief technology officer found the policies in training, the limitations and technology themselves, mitigate the working groups concern . Let's go to the next slide.",306,,
1559,0.97,10787.777,10804.16,"I found that there are a number of policies that address allowable methods to protect these images, but as the working group did note, the Cert doesn't include policies that define the appropriate use of these Technologies.",307,,
1560,0.97,10804.16,10815.905,"There is language, and the appropriate use of application of the cameras, but they don't specifically say policies that say when you should use them.",307,,
1561,0.97,10815.905,10832.888,Policies also don't address the working group recommendation to the acquisition of cameras with prohibited capabilities such as facial recognition or to prevent the use of--from the cameras.,307,,
1562,0.97,10832.888,10846.435,"I don't know that I mention this, for all three of these technologies, the same issue with group 2, the equity Metrics haven't been developed yet for the Cto annual equity assessment.",307,,
1563,0.97,10846.435,10850.84,I would pause there to see if people have questions about the Situational awareness cameras.,307,,
1564,0.97,10850.84,10855.11,Councilmember Herbold.,308,,
1565,0.97,10855.11,10856.512,I have to sign up.,309,,
1566,0.97,10856.512,10878.267,"I want to ask . I remember the last, amendments that we offered . They were written in a way that we were not changing the requirements.",309,,
1567,0.97,10878.267,10890.079,We were asking the Department whether or not they could change the requirements consistent with our policy objectives.,309,,
1568,0.97,10890.079,10895.784,Is that the same limitation we will be working under with this particular set of Technologies?,309,,
1569,0.97,10895.784,10896.852,Yes.,310,,
1570,0.97,10896.852,10915.07,"The constraint is, the Council is--the Charter is strong about the police Chiefs authority and limits the ability to dictate operations at that level.",310,,
1571,0.97,10915.07,10922.711,I would be working with you on language that you could ask the Úpolice Department to develop some policies.,310,,
1572,0.97,10922.711,10924.013,You could ask them to report things like that.,310,,
1573,0.97,10924.013,10931.921,"If the policies were developed, then those could be added to the server.",310,,
1574,0.97,10931.921,10944.333,Is that specific to the Charter authority and powers of the police chief or is it for all of the executive departments?,311,,
1575,0.97,10944.333,10946.902,Specific to the police.,311,,
1576,0.97,10946.902,10952.908,"So for technology that is operated for a start, we can make the change in the legislation?",312,,
1577,0.97,10952.908,10955.744,We don't have to ask?,312,,
1578,0.97,10955.744,10964.553,It depends on what it is.,313,,
1579,0.97,10964.553,10965.254,There are different rules.,313,,
1580,0.97,10965.254,10965.721,Super helpful.,314,,
1581,0.97,10965.721,10966.121,Thank you.,314,,
1582,0.97,10966.121,10967.523,Understand we are working under a May 10 deadline.,314,,
1583,0.97,10967.523,10969.325,We will work to get it.,314,,
1584,0.97,10969.325,10971.86,Thank you.,314,,
1585,0.97,10971.86,10978.267,I have a 12:30 meeting that I need to attend.,315,,
1586,0.97,10978.267,10983.372,"If I leave, we will not have a Quorum any longer.",315,,
1587,0.97,10983.372,10991.78,"Rather than just signing up and cancel, ending the meeting immediately, I wanted to give you a moment of awareness.",315,,
1588,0.97,10991.78,10995.751,Yes.,316,,
1589,0.97,10995.751,10996.051,Thank you.,316,,
1590,0.97,10996.051,11000.789,Staying with us all the way to 12:30.,316,,
1591,0.97,11000.789,11006.695,We appreciate the police Department and information technology Department as well as central staff briefing us on these three Technologies.,316,,
1592,0.97,11006.695,11010.299,We are not voting on them today.,316,,
1593,0.97,11010.299,11011.467,"Lisa Kaye, thank you so much.",316,,
1594,0.97,11011.467,11014.603,Your presentation is Online.,316,,

1597,0.97,11021.377,11026.815,We are available over the next few days if we put together amendments.,316,,
1598,0.97,11026.815,11027.783,Thank you.,316,,
1599,0.97,11027.783,11033.622,Thank you Councilmember's Strauss.,316,,
