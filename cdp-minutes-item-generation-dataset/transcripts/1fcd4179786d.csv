0,0.97,1754.552,1771.569,"Item number one, our first agenda item is CB 120265 which extends the legislation for six months while final legislation is created . will you please read the abbreviated title into the record?",0,,
1,0.97,1771.569,1785.216,"Cb 120265, an ordinance relating to Land-Use regulation of home occupations, extending for six months interim development controls established ordinance 126293.",1,,
2,0.97,1785.216,1788.92,Thank you.,2,,
3,0.97,1788.92,1796.661,"Before we begin our public comment, public hearing, we are joined by Ketil Freeman of Council central staff.",2,,
4,0.97,1796.661,1801.266,I briefed the committee two weeks ago on the work we did last year on the original bringing business on legislation.,2,,
5,0.97,1801.266,1805.003,Ketil Freeman is here today for a formal briefing to answer any questions you may have.,2,,
6,0.97,1805.003,1808.84,Please take it away.,2,,
7,0.97,1808.84,1809.24,Sure.,3,,
8,0.97,1809.24,1812.911,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",3,,
9,0.97,1812.911,1816.981,"Today, the committee will hold a public hearing and may make a recommendation on CB 120265.",3,,
10,0.97,1816.981,1827.325,That bill would extend for six months . interim element regulations were put in place through ordinance 126293 about a year ago.,3,,
11,0.97,1827.325,1832.797,Council bill 120265 is pretty straightforward.,3,,
12,0.97,1832.797,1857.388,"It provides for a six-month extension that does have a ratifying and confirming clause, ordinance 120265 will expire on April 21 so the Council bill 120265, should it pass, would ratify actions taken after Council passage but before the effective date of the bill . Councilmember Strauss gave a briefing at the last committee meeting.",3,,
13,0.97,1857.388,1868.366,I am happy to walk through the presentation related to ordinance 12693 just to refresh your memory if that is useful.,3,,
14,0.97,1868.366,1878.309,Let me share my screen here.,4,,
15,0.97,1878.309,1881.579,Can you all see that?,4,,
16,0.97,1881.579,1886.985,It is a Powerpoint presentation.,4,,
17,0.97,1886.985,1888.653,Full-Screen mode.,4,,
18,0.97,1888.653,1931.129,"Just to refresh your memory a little bit, Council members, about a year ago, the council passed ordinance, known as the bringing business home legislation . that legislation establish interim development controls related to home occupations and neighborhood, residential, and multi family zones . The purpose of the bill was to provide temporary regulatory flex ability for Home-Based businesses to allow those Home-Based businesses to continue operating during the Covid pandemic with fewer restrictions and allow small businesses to remain operating to speed the economic recovery.",4,,
19,0.97,1931.129,1946.811,Kind of the instant case for this was yonder cider which was operating out of a garage in somebody's home . yonder cider was cited and these regulations allowed yonder cider to continue operating.,4,,
20,0.97,1946.811,1960.992,"I understand now that they are a tasting room that has moved to a Brick-And-Mortar location in Ballard . Prior to the interim controls, how did the city regulate home occupations?",4,,
21,0.97,1960.992,1975.84,The city of Seattle has a relatively permissive regulatory regime for home occupations.,4,,
22,0.97,1975.84,1976.641,A permit is not required.,4,,
23,0.97,1976.641,1978.242,A Land-Use permit is not required to operate.,4,,
24,0.97,1978.242,1979.477,"Instead, there are performance standards.",4,,
25,0.97,1979.477,1985.65,Somebody who has a home occupation may need to get a permit for some type of physical improvement to their property but they don't need a Land-Use permit.,4,,
26,0.97,1985.65,1996.928,The performance standards were primarily limitations around activities that may be seen as nuisance activities in a residential zone.,4,,
27,0.97,1996.928,1999.697,There is a limitation on the number of commercial vehicle deliveries and Pickups.,4,,
28,0.97,1999.697,2010.341,There is a requirement that customers be by appointment only . The residential appearance of a home must be maintained.,4,,
29,0.97,2010.341,2013.678,"If it is a multi family home, single-family home, the residential appearance must be maintained.",4,,
30,0.97,2013.678,2016.447,There could be no more than two Nonresidents who can work at the home occupation.,4,,
31,0.97,2016.447,2024.222,The home occupation cannot contribute to on Street traffic.,4,,
32,0.97,2024.222,2025.79,Signs identifying the business cannot exceed 64 square inches.,4,,
33,0.97,2025.79,2032.497,That is pretty small.,4,,
34,0.97,2032.497,2034.332,That is less than one square foot in size.,4,,
35,0.97,2034.332,2036.134,Outdoor storage cannot be associated with home occupations.,4,,
36,0.97,2036.134,2047.445,"You can't have materials that you use stored outdoors and there are limitations on noise, odor, dust, and other standard nuisance impacts that apply to home occupations.",4,,
37,0.97,2047.445,2052.183,What changed under ordinance?,4,,
38,0.97,2052.183,2056.454,The number of employees was modified.,4,,
39,0.97,2056.454,2064.762,There could be the type of customer business that was also modified.,4,,
40,0.97,2064.762,2066.197,No longer needs to be by appointment only.,4,,
41,0.97,2066.197,2068.266,There can be walk-up visits.,4,,
42,0.97,2068.266,2070.468,Limitations on increased traffic and parking demand were also modified.,4,,
43,0.97,2070.468,2100.598,"There are a couple of Clarifications around the limitations on increased traffic and parking demand that were made by amendment at full council . The Council was considering ordinance 126293 and I clarified that you cannot have a drive-in business that is a home occupation . Also, for certain types of home occupations like automotive or retail sales, if you're working on cars in your garage, you also can't increase parking demand.",4,,
44,0.97,2100.598,2119.617,"Additionally, ordinance 126293 allowed home occupations to have larger, Non-Illuminated signs, five square feet, and allowed home occupations to clarify that they can use a wired accessory use parking for their home occupation purpose.",4,,
45,0.97,2119.617,2130.194,"For example, if you are using your garage as a tasting room, that would be permitted under the regulations.",4,,
46,0.97,2130.194,2132.83,I am going in the wrong direction here.,5,,
47,0.97,2132.83,2160.591,That is a summary of what 126293 did . The current bill would extend use regulations for an additional six-month period to allow more time to develop a proposal for permanent regulations and also to allow Home-Based occupations that have taken advantage of the change in regulations to continue operating while the pandemic is ongoing.,6,,
48,0.97,2160.591,2161.893,Wonderful.,7,,
49,0.97,2161.893,2162.293,Thank you.,7,,
50,0.97,2162.293,2169.133,That was very helpful . The last things that you said are most important.,7,,
51,0.97,2169.133,2176.507,Sbc I is taking the time to create the final regulations so that we can take that up.,7,,
52,0.97,2176.507,2187.718,This extension is to give them the time and ensure that we continue the level playing field so that folks don't have to shut up shop and then reopen shop just because we lapsed.,7,,
53,0.97,2187.718,2199.43,Can you remind me what--when do the current regulations expire and will adopting this extension next week allow us to avoid that gap?,7,,
54,0.97,2199.43,2205.536,You are on mute.,8,,
55,0.97,2205.536,2207.371,The current regulations expire on April 21.,9,,
56,0.97,2207.371,2208.606,There is no avoiding a gap.,9,,
57,0.97,2208.606,2211.842,The proposed bill has a ratifying confirmed clause.,9,,
58,0.97,2211.842,2223.02,Any action taken after Council approval but before the bill becomes effective are ratified and confirmed by the Council.,9,,
59,0.97,2223.02,2244.942,"For example, if there was enforcement action against a home based occupation that occurred after passage by the Council but before the bill became effective and they modified the inspection response based on the future regulation, that action would be ratified by the bill.",9,,
60,0.97,2244.942,2250.648,"Colleagues, I know I did my best playing central staff on TV at the last committee.",10,,
61,0.97,2250.648,2252.25,Do you have questions for Mr.,10,,
62,0.97,2252.25,2258.756,Freeman?,10,,
63,0.97,2258.756,2263.427,It looks like you did an okay job.,11,,
64,0.97,2263.427,2263.894,Councilmember Nelson?,11,,
65,0.97,2263.894,2264.662,Take it away.,11,,
66,0.97,2264.662,2270.534,You are still on mute.,11,,
67,0.97,2270.534,2270.935,Hello.,12,,
68,0.97,2270.935,2271.802,Sorry about that.,12,,
69,0.97,2271.802,2279.91,I asked this last time and maybe you can speak to this.,12,,
70,0.97,2279.91,2291.889,"Basically I said, how has it been going? do we have any information about new businesses that have developed that have been facilitated by this legislation since it has been in effect?",12,,
71,0.97,2291.889,2296.961,"The short answer to that is, we don't know.",13,,
72,0.97,2296.961,2305.269,That partly has to do with the existing regulatory regime.,13,,
73,0.97,2305.269,2308.639,"Prior to the bill passing, the city did not require any Land- use permits for a home occupation.",13,,
74,0.97,2308.639,2313.444,You just had to meet the performance standards.,13,,
75,0.97,2313.444,2316.047,We don't actually know how many businesses are operating out of people's homes.,13,,
76,0.97,2316.047,2318.716,We did not know prior to the pandemic and we don't know now.,13,,
77,0.97,2318.716,2320.918,The only thing we can rely on is anecdotal evidence.,13,,
78,0.97,2320.918,2330.061,"For that, your sources are as good as mine, what you read in the paper.",13,,
79,0.97,2330.061,2330.895,That was my question.,14,,
80,0.97,2330.895,2331.862,Thank you.,14,,
81,0.97,2331.862,2335.533,Great.,15,,
82,0.97,2335.533,2337.001,"Councilmember Nelson, you raise a really great point.",15,,
83,0.97,2337.001,2339.804,That is one thing I want to see changed.,15,,
84,0.97,2339.804,2347.712,I don't need to see a cost or a fee associated with the permit.,15,,
85,0.97,2347.712,2352.95,"Right now, the best way for us to try to figure it out is by looking at business permits that are existing in residential areas.",15,,
86,0.97,2352.95,2355.686,"If we had a permit for Home- based businesses, we could have better data.",15,,
87,0.97,2355.686,2361.592,"Again, I would not want to put another fee on top of that.",15,,
88,0.97,2361.592,2369.467,Got it . I do have other comments but that is about the bill in general so I don't know if now is the time.,16,,
89,0.97,2369.467,2369.867,Yeah.,17,,
90,0.97,2369.867,2371.502,"I would say, take it away.",17,,
91,0.97,2371.502,2372.103,Okay.,18,,
92,0.97,2372.103,2385.916,"Last year when Council voted on this, I wrote to the full council as a citizen and as someone with Small-business experience.",19,,
93,0.97,2385.916,2392.423,"Let me say right now, I am going to vote for this thing but I am going to go through my issues.",19,,
94,0.97,2392.423,2409.073,"What I said last year and what I still feel is that in last year, March, middle of the pandemic, I wrote in the saying basically, if you want to help small businesses right now, there are lots of things that Council can do.",19,,
95,0.97,2409.073,2415.88,"This seemed like a distraction because it is changing the Land- use code, which is pretty significant, for Home-Based businesses.",19,,
96,0.97,2415.88,2421.252,It did not seem like there were very many Home-Based businesses that were clamoring for Land- use change.,19,,
97,0.97,2421.252,2429.56,I understand that there were a couple of businesses that had reached out . that was my main point.,19,,
98,0.97,2429.56,2445.476,I also--this legislation was being put forward as leveling of the playing field.,19,,
99,0.97,2445.476,2447.378,"In fact, it confers added advantage to Home-Based businesses.",19,,
100,0.97,2447.378,2448.913,Home-Based businesses do not have to pay rent.,19,,
101,0.97,2448.913,2461.125,"They don't have to put up guarantees or their homes, basically, to back a bank loan to have a business in a brick and mortar.",19,,
102,0.97,2461.125,2463.46,"The utility bills, et cetera.",19,,
103,0.97,2463.46,2477.942,"Saying that it levels the playing field--if you ever tried to get the commercial space and start a business, it seems like it is just the opposite.",19,,
104,0.97,2477.942,2484.081,I am completely for small business incubation.,19,,
105,0.97,2484.081,2490.354,"That is one thing I asked about last time, which is, how did it work?",19,,
106,0.97,2490.354,2494.024,I want to see Home-Based businesses move into larger space.,19,,
107,0.97,2494.024,2503.801,"I want them to succeed, expand, and thrive and ultimately contribute to the vitality of our neighborhood business district.",19,,
108,0.97,2503.801,2506.637,I was happy to see that--I wanted to be an incubation.,19,,
109,0.97,2506.637,2519.016,"It is not clear to me--this is some information that I will need to get behind, making these things permanent . that is the goal.",19,,
110,0.97,2519.016,2526.69,"I want businesses to thrive and I want them to contribute to the vitality of their neighborhoods, ultimately.",19,,
111,0.97,2526.69,2542.106,"I have not heard very much about impacts to neighborhoods, what residents living next door or on the same Street--I really would want to see that kind of outreach.",19,,
112,0.97,2542.106,2542.973,Let me see.,19,,
113,0.97,2542.973,2554.285,There are lots of models for small business Incubators that I could get into.,19,,
114,0.97,2554.285,2560.391,Basically--anyway--I am not worried about the competition.,19,,
115,0.97,2560.391,2576.106,I think the kind of business that sets up shop in the garage is different from the kind of business that would set out looking for a commercial space in a neighborhood business district.,19,,
116,0.97,2576.106,2595.96,That is not what motivated me then and it is not what is motivated me now but I really do think that there needs to be outreach to our neighborhood chambers and that other businesses might feel differently . They are putting in all of this other resources to be able to set up shop in a brick and mortar someplace.,19,,
117,0.97,2595.96,2599.83,I just want to make sure that they are aware and know how they feel.,19,,
118,0.97,2599.83,2623.988,"I am going to vote for this because I support small businesses . I know that a lot of people are operating in their homes, especially in immigrant communities and in Bipoc, small business owners that really don't have the resources to have a commercial space.",19,,
119,0.97,2623.988,2641.038,"I just want those concerns on the record and I look forward to seeing what we know in six months or so, or a year, however long this is extended before these things become permanent.",19,,
120,0.97,2641.038,2642.139,Thank you very much.,19,,
121,0.97,2642.139,2644.308,Thank you Councilmember Nelson.,20,,
122,0.97,2644.308,2647.711,I appreciate that feedback.,20,,
123,0.97,2647.711,2649.179,Other Councilmembers?,20,,
124,0.97,2649.179,2654.818,Anyone with questions or comments before we open the public hearing?,20,,
125,0.97,2654.818,2668.465,"Seeing none--cliff Sanchez, can you confirm for me--we don't have any public comment registrants remotely present for this public hearing.",20,,
126,0.97,2668.465,2670.934,Do I need to open and close?,20,,
127,0.97,2670.934,2672.369,Do I need to read the script?,20,,
128,0.97,2672.369,2677.808,Can you advise me on my next steps?,20,,
129,0.97,2677.808,2685.115,"If you wouldn't mind, chair, just stating you are opening up the public hearing and Verifying there is no public comment and then closing it, the public hearing.",21,,
130,0.97,2685.115,2686.95,You do not need to read the entire script.,21,,
131,0.97,2686.95,2687.584,"Thank you, clerk.",22,,
132,0.97,2687.584,2695.492,"At this time, just confirming there are no further questions or comments before we open the public hearing.",22,,

134,0.97,2699.93,2704.201,Before we open the public hearing--let's see.,22,,
135,0.97,2704.201,2704.835,Where is this.,22,,

142,0.97,2746.543,2752.983,The public hearing on CB 120265 is now closed.,24,,
143,0.97,2752.983,2783.213,"Colleagues, given that this is a second meeting we have had to discuss legislation and that there is already a gap in this legislation, and that this is an extension of legislation we have already adopted last year, I will ask that we suspend the rules today to vote on legislation out of committee, voting today will allow us to keep the extension on track so there is not a larger gap in the interim regulations.",24,,
144,0.97,2783.213,2790.32,"Colleagues, any concerns with suspending the rules the same day as the public to vote out the bill?",24,,

173,0.97,2866.163,2885.816,I am excited that we have the opportunity to vote on this legislation to provide businesses already serving as a springboard for our small businesses and our local economy to be able to continue this good work . a huge amount of appreciation for folks like yonder cider which started out as a small business operating out of a garage and they have had good coverage.,39,,
174,0.97,2885.816,2896.994,"Their ability to transition into a tap room, commercial space, which was due to the great work of this body and your leadership, Mr. chair.",39,,
175,0.97,2896.994,2929.893,"It is a great success story in these times as we are looking to how Seattle can have resilient, local economy that is thriving and diverse . I think it also makes our neighborhood more diverse, thriving, and vibrant, and I look forward to hearing more about the newest businesses that will continue to crop up as we think about ways for folks to walk around their local community and see how they can support local businesses operating by our neighbors throughout our community.",39,,
176,0.97,2929.893,2931.161,Looking forward to supporting this legislation.,39,,

198,0.97,2981.445,2994.925,"Moving on to Much-Anticipated legislation, our next item is Council bill 12027 which requires tree service providers to register with the city.",54,,
199,0.97,2994.925,3002.199,Will you please read the abbreviated title into the record?,54,,
200,0.97,3002.199,3009.306,"Agenda item 2, council 120207, an ordinance relating Land-Use and urban forestry, adding a tree for service rider registration procedure and requirement.",55,,
201,0.97,3009.306,3009.706,Thank you.,56,,
202,0.97,3009.706,3013.377,This legislation was introduced by Councilmember Pedersen.,56,,
203,0.97,3013.377,3017.047,I am excited and happy and honored to be cosponsor in a separate.,56,,
204,0.97,3017.047,3021.051,Would you like to take it away?,56,,
205,0.97,3021.051,3024.354,You are on mute.,57,,
206,0.97,3024.354,3036.733,"Thank you, chair Strauss I also want to thank Yolanda who has been helping us with this bill throughout and my staff and your staff and everybody who has worked on this.",58,,
207,0.97,3036.733,3047.577,"Thank you for scheduling Council bill 120207 for a vote out of committee today and for your hard work on it, chair Strauss.",58,,
208,0.97,3047.577,3056.52,This bill to register tree service providers who want to exceed routine pruning or cut down trees was introduced last October.,58,,
209,0.97,3056.52,3059.489,We walked through the specifics of our Committee on February 9.,58,,
210,0.97,3059.489,3088.718,"The amendments published with today's agenda reflect much of the discussion we had last month and I urge you to support all of these amendments and then we will discuss them individually here . passing out of committee today, this Council bill 120207 will be a small but mighty step to increase transparency and accountability by simply having tree service providers register with our city government before they cut down more trees in the midst of the climate crisis, inflicting severe heat waves.",58,,
211,0.97,3088.718,3100.931,Let's not have any more trees Sawed to death in the middle of the night by Chainsaws wielded by unknown tree cutters . Let's daylight these operations on a Registry for all to see.,58,,
212,0.97,3100.931,3107.204,Profession or Arborists who care about trees and follow the rules are ready already register with the city for removing trees on public land.,58,,
213,0.97,3107.204,3116.947,This bill would create that transparent process for all other properties in our Emerald city in our Evergreen state.,58,,
214,0.97,3116.947,3143.807,"Due to the horrible heat waves last year, we saw the negative impacts to communities that have seen a loss of tree canopy and experienced harmful heat Island effects, increasing accountability and transparency by registering tree service providers who cut down or heavily pruned trees should improve compliance with current and future protections of Seattle trees and help those neighborhoods most at risk of losing more trees.",58,,
215,0.97,3143.807,3164.628,"I want to thank the dozens of tree advocates who already know very well the environmental and health benefits of existing, mature trees and would said vastly urge the Council to do more about the city's dwindling tree canopy.",58,,
216,0.97,3164.628,3172.235,"Similar to what we saw in February, we saw during the past 24 hours, dozens of Emails asking us to pass this Council bill today . want to thank those who took time to call in today.",58,,
217,0.97,3172.235,3173.103,Also the Seattle Audubon society.,58,,
218,0.97,3173.103,3175.205,We just got an Email from them.,58,,
219,0.97,3175.205,3180.61,Many of these for the past two years.,58,,
220,0.97,3180.61,3191.922,"In addition to this support from Emails and public comment, there is a statistically significant survey conducted throughout Seattle last year that showed 77% supported registration system.",58,,
221,0.97,3191.922,3194.724,We are here today to hopefully pass it out of committee.,58,,
222,0.97,3194.724,3198.028,Thank you.,58,,
223,0.97,3198.028,3199.195,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,59,,
224,0.97,3199.195,3208.371,Well said.,59,,
225,0.97,3208.371,3210.206,We are joined by Yolanda Council central staff.,59,,
226,0.97,3210.206,3226.389,"Walk us through the legislation again as well as three amendments that have been proposed, including one of them as a substitute that wrapped up a lot of the amendments over the last few weeks.",59,,
227,0.97,3226.389,3227.857,"Yolanda, would you like to take it away?",59,,
228,0.97,3227.857,3228.291,Is Facture.,59,,
229,0.97,3228.291,3228.692,Thank you.,59,,
230,0.97,3228.692,3231.161,Let me get my screen shared here.,59,,
231,0.97,3231.161,3236.8,I think we had a good comment.,59,,
232,0.97,3236.8,3254.551,My intention with this presentation is to describe Council bill 120207 that would establish a requirement that tree service providers register with the city prior to conducting commercial tree work on private property.,59,,
233,0.97,3254.551,3260.156,The city already has a tree service provider Registry that is administered by the Seattle Department of transportation.,59,,
234,0.97,3260.156,3279.476,It is only for entities doing work on trees in the public Right-Of-Way . We did discuss the potential impacts of the bill at the meeting on the nine.,59,,
235,0.97,3279.476,3293.289,We will today focus on some of the key points from the Seattle Department of construction and inspections implementation analysis which is attached to the agenda and then also discussed the potential amendments that are attached to the agenda.,59,,
236,0.97,3293.289,3306.503,"As a reminder, this legislation would amend Seattle municipal code title 25. it would establish a Registry process and system within 90 days of the date of the ordinance.",59,,
237,0.97,3306.503,3310.306,Tree service providers with and have 90 days to register with Sdci following that period.,59,,
238,0.97,3310.306,3320.517,"After this, all tree service providers would need to be registered in order to apply for permits or provide tree related reports to Sdci.",59,,
239,0.97,3320.517,3342.038,"It would define commercial tree work as conducting major pruning, removal of trees larger than 6 inches of diameter at breast height and the assessment of tree health or hazard risk for financial compensation.",59,,
240,0.97,3342.305,3345.075,It excludes routine pruning activities that do not meet the threshold of major pruning.,59,,
241,0.97,3345.075,3360.29,"It would define tree service provider as an entity engaged in commercial tree work and require that register tree service providers comply with various best practices related to the specific type of work they are engaged such as maintaining adequate supervision over their workers as they conduct the work, assessing what the appropriate level of tree work is needed to meet objectives.",59,,
242,0.97,3360.29,3377.974,The authorized Sdci to create rules to support administration of the Registry and other sections of title 23 to align with the legislation is intended.,59,,
243,0.97,3377.974,3394.257,"This table is a Side-By-Side comparison of what is being proposed and the legislation before you and Sdot's existing Registry system here since we talked about it at length last month, I will just remind you of the key differences.",60,,
244,0.97,3394.257,3402.766,Here we have the commercial liability insurance coverage that is required.,60,,
245,0.97,3402.766,3404.834,Sdci has discretion to determine what is the appropriate amount.,60,,
246,0.97,3404.834,3418.815,"Sdot allows tree service providers to either have an international society of Arboriculture, certified Arborists on staff or retainer whereas Council bill 120207 would require that that person be on staff.",60,,
247,0.97,3418.815,3431.394,There is also a shorter public notice requirement and a number of folks in the public comment noted this.,60,,
248,0.97,3431.394,3439.736,"For you all, the difference acknowledges that the Sdci public notice is more about letting people know that commercial tree work is authorized but is not necessarily an Appealable decision.",60,,
249,0.97,3439.736,3453.149,It is something that Sdci acknowledges whereas Sdot's public notices is intended to inform and allow people to appeal the decision.,60,,
250,0.97,3453.149,3462.292,"Thus, there was that time because these are publicly owned trees . There is a difference of who owns the tree and who is making that decision.",60,,
251,0.97,3462.292,3493.79,"Also, the penalty would be different if the bill--Sdot current practices--the proposed Registry would prohibit Sdci from accepting tree related reports from a tree service provider who has been issued a single notice of violation related to the illegal removal of an exceptional tree.",60,,
252,0.97,3493.79,3498.061,I kind of ran through that but if anyone has any questions about anything on this slide before I move on?,60,,
253,0.97,3498.061,3507.704,"Just noting, a lot of these issues have been changed in the substitute.",61,,
254,0.97,3507.704,3510.573,This was the starting point for the bill that we had our last committee.,61,,
255,0.97,3510.573,3515.111,"Council members, maybe it would be helpful if I moved legislation so that we could take up the substitute.",61,,
256,0.97,3515.111,3520.817,That makes significant changes to be this.,61,,
257,0.97,3520.817,3522.018,Do I see consensus there?,61,,
258,0.97,3522.018,3526.256,Do other folks have questions at this time?,61,,
259,0.97,3526.256,3533.997,"Vice chair Morales, take it away.",61,,
260,0.97,3533.997,3542.338,I have a question about what it means to resolve a violation.,62,,
261,0.97,3542.338,3543.172,In the penalty section?,62,,
262,0.97,3543.172,3544.34,Is not paying a fine?,62,,
263,0.97,3544.34,3547.01,That is typically paying a fine or if Sdci withdrew the violation.,63,,
264,0.97,3547.01,3548.011,Those are two pathways.,63,,
265,0.97,3548.011,3555.752,"Just Interjecting, I think some of that language cleaned up in the substitute.",64,,
266,0.97,3555.752,3566.93,"I am going to move the bill so that we can discuss the substitute at this time unless, council member Nelson, do you have questions?",64,,
267,0.97,3566.93,3567.163,No.,64,,
268,0.97,3567.163,3570.099,"Before we take up amendments, I will place the legislation before us.",64,,
269,0.97,3570.099,3575.838,Moved to recommend passage of Council bill 12027.,64,,
270,0.97,3575.838,3576.673,Is there a second?,64,,
271,0.97,3576.673,3577.073,Second.,65,,
272,0.97,3577.073,3580.51,It has been moved and Seconded.,66,,
273,0.97,3580.51,3584.18,The first of three amendments today as a substitute amendment that Councilmember Pedersen and I cosponsored together.,66,,
274,0.97,3584.18,3593.523,This substitute reflects a suite of changes we agreed to and they will make the legislation more effective.,66,,
275,0.97,3593.523,3605.301,"It includes technical changes, extends the limitation time to months and sets a date certain, of them attend, for tree service riders to register by.",66,,
276,0.97,3605.301,3612.208,"It allows for tree service providers to have an Arborist on staff, on retainer.",66,,
277,0.97,3612.208,3621.384,A tree service provider would be removed from the Registry for one year after two violations.,66,,
278,0.97,3621.384,3651.814,"Lastly, it adjusts the requirements for tree work assessment qualification, requiring the applicant for hazardous tree removal must be qualified and requiring that for hazardous exceptional trees, a different tree service provider must file a permit rather than as compared to the provider who plans to the removal.",66,,
279,0.97,3651.814,3653.049,"Council member Pedersen, did I Miss anything?",66,,
280,0.97,3653.049,3657.487,"Yolanda, if you have a different slide that reflects the substitute, I think that is important to have visually on the screen.",66,,
281,0.97,3657.487,3658.721,That is mine.,67,,
282,0.97,3658.721,3660.957,There was just one more slide before I got to that.,67,,
283,0.97,3660.957,3665.828,I wanted to talk about the limitation now.,67,,
284,0.97,3665.828,3668.664,It is one more piece of new information before we moved into that.,67,,
285,0.97,3668.664,3674.57,Would you prefer that I go to that slide that shows the track changes version?,67,,
286,0.97,3674.57,3676.806,I think there was some confusion just a minute ago.,68,,
287,0.97,3676.806,3683.913,Here it is and then we can move back to the implementation for folks' reference.,69,,
288,0.97,3683.913,3694.457,"Chair, I think you got all of the critical points on what is included.",69,,
289,0.97,3694.457,3709.906,"Some of these things are not reflected in the table, particularly the hazardous tree permit requirements but I am noting in this slide where now there is more consistency between the Registry and what would be in the Council bill before you.",69,,
290,0.97,3709.906,3718.681,"Again, noting that I as a certified Arborists on retainers, that one will match.",69,,
291,0.97,3718.681,3732.261,There is another amendment that would create--the substitute would bring the penalty structure into alignment with Sdot.,69,,
292,0.97,3732.261,3733.696,Very helpful.,70,,
293,0.97,3733.696,3737.333,"Councilmember Pedersen, any thoughts on this?",70,,
294,0.97,3737.333,3739.368,I agree.,71,,
295,0.97,3739.368,3744.173,This slide is very helpful in clearing up some of the earlier questions.,71,,
296,0.97,3744.173,3750.346,Thank you.,71,,
297,0.97,3750.346,3750.746,Wonderful.,72,,
298,0.97,3750.746,3753.983,"Vice chair Morales, Councilmember Nelson?",73,,
299,0.97,3753.983,3754.617,Any questions?,73,,
300,0.97,3754.617,3755.218,I am seeing none.,73,,
301,0.97,3755.218,3760.289,"Yolanda, would you like to finish your presentation?",73,,
302,0.97,3760.289,3761.657,Sorry for interrupting.,73,,
303,0.97,3761.657,3763.926,No problem.,74,,
304,0.97,3763.926,3764.56,Keeping it fluid.,74,,
305,0.97,3764.56,3767.43,It is all good.,74,,
306,0.97,3767.43,3811.073,I just wanted to highlight for the committee that we did receive additional information between the committee meeting on this subject and today . that implementation memo is attached to the agenda . Sdci anticipates it will take five to seven months to build the Registry and associated automated features that help with registration in creating notices and also that Sdci noted that this new system needs to integrate with the overall permitting system so that reviewers are able to easily confirm that tree service providers are registered as required.,74,,
307,0.97,3811.073,3828.558,"The department estimates that the total cost of implanting the proposal this year will be between $300,000 and $470,000 with roughly half of the amount supported by the general Fund and the remainder can be permit fees supported.",74,,
308,0.97,3828.558,3835.198,"Costs include outreach, development of the technology to support the Registry and temporary staff to support these efforts.",74,,
309,0.97,3835.198,3854.317,The department anticipates requesting the additional general fund of support in the forthcoming midyear supplemental budget . Sdci will then consider what needs might be necessary . These would be included in the 2023 proposed budget.,74,,
310,0.97,3854.317,3856.552,Anyone have any problems with that information?,74,,
311,0.97,3856.552,3861.691,I don't . colleagues?,75,,
312,0.97,3861.691,3868.965,"Seeing none, take it away.",75,,
313,0.97,3868.965,3870.266,We talked about the substitute.,76,,
314,0.97,3870.266,3889.252,I just wanted to give a chance to ask any questions that the chair very well captured all of the many different big pieces there.,76,,
315,0.97,3889.252,3890.887,I want to highlight the hazardous tree requirement.,76,,
316,0.97,3890.887,3895.358,I would say that one is the biggest change.,76,,
317,0.97,3895.358,3907.937,The city already requires that anybody removing injury have the three risk assessment qualification credential.,76,,
318,0.97,3907.937,3917.28,That is already a requirement.,76,,
319,0.97,3917.28,3925.688,"The change here is more around Codifying the requirements that are in one Sdci has, a hazard tree tip that they have dated a couple of years ago.",76,,
320,0.97,3925.688,3949.011,"That includes a report about the health of the tree . The difference here is that if the tree that would be removed that is also being deemed hazardous would meet the city's definition of exceptional, this would require that there be two different registered tree service providers involved.",76,,
321,0.97,3949.011,3957.954,There would be one who would independently assess the tree and submit the required application materials and the other tree service provider would perform the major thing or removal.,76,,
322,0.97,3957.954,3973.169,In no case can there be just one tree service provider who applies for the permit and performs the removal.,76,,

348,0.97,4043.806,4045.674,Wonderful.,91,,
349,0.97,4045.674,4055.451,The motion carries . substitute amendment one carries.,91,,
350,0.97,4055.451,4056.652,There I no amendment two.,91,,
351,0.97,4056.652,4065.995,We will move to Councilmember Pedersen's amendment three.,91,,
352,0.97,4065.995,4068.664,"When you like is your amendment?'s actually, central staff would describe it.",91,,
353,0.97,4068.664,4070.199,It is just a paragraph.,91,,
354,0.97,4070.199,4074.937,Sure.,92,,
355,0.97,4074.937,4078.507,Amendment three when Adam an additional reporting requirement to a subdivision or boundary line adjustment process.,92,,
356,0.97,4078.507,4103.799,This would require that either a registered tree service provider estate registered landscape architect provide a report describing how the design of a proposed subdivision supports the policy of maximizing retention of existing trees.,92,,
357,0.97,4103.799,4108.871,"Apparently, the city only requires that a registered surveyor draw a map and does not require an explanation of how the plans are drawn.",92,,
358,0.97,4108.871,4128.624,"I will note that the subdivision process does not involve permitting the element directly but does it usually take proposed development into account, such as building Footprints and vehicular access.",92,,
359,0.97,4128.624,4129.258,Thank you.,93,,
360,0.97,4129.258,4132.495,It is just one paragraph.,93,,
361,0.97,4132.495,4154.25,You can see it is the same language that was in a February 3 central standard time . It says either a registered tree service provider or licensed architect would prepare a report.,93,,
362,0.97,4154.25,4159.922,"Can be less than a page, submitted to the director of 20 or.",93,,
363,0.97,4159.922,4163.993,That is only if it will be a subdivision or boundary line adjustment.,93,,
364,0.97,4163.993,4166.629,It would simply describe how they are trying to maximize retention of trees.,93,,
365,0.97,4166.629,4197.293,"It is not required that the trees be retained . If we are trying to get at this goal of yes, yes and, yes we can maximize unit centuries, it is about being more creative and Proactive early in the process, Configuring the Footprint of the proposed building in a way that tries to retain the trees.",93,,
366,0.97,4197.293,4199.728,It is having trees top of mind earlier in the process.,93,,
367,0.97,4199.728,4215.377,"I know that creative architect send landscape architects can get this done to maximize both units and trees and this is a requirement that they put down on paper, how they are trying to do that.",93,,
368,0.97,4215.377,4217.346,I would ask for your support of this amendment.,93,,
369,0.97,4217.346,4219.615,I am happy to answer questions or try to move it first.,93,,
370,0.97,4219.615,4222.484,Thank you.,94,,
371,0.97,4222.484,4227.69,I have some comments but I will wait to share them.,94,,
372,0.97,4227.69,4232.828,"Vice chair Morales, take it away.",94,,
373,0.97,4232.828,4241.437,I do have some questions about this amendment but I don't know if you want the amendment first and then have the discussion.,95,,
374,0.97,4241.437,4243.105,I am happy to move it either way.,95,,
375,0.97,4243.105,4244.239,I will share my thoughts.,96,,
376,0.97,4244.239,4247.276,We can move it and then take up discussion.,96,,
377,0.97,4247.276,4256.585,I really appreciate Councilmember Pedersen the intent behind what you are bringing this amendment today.,96,,
378,0.97,4256.585,4280.376,"I, unfortunately, will not be able to support the amendment today I appreciate your intent to ensure we are maximizing protection of trees during subdivision process, I do believe this change will impose on housing without a new public benefit . We already have a requirement as part of the subdivision process that applicants must maximize the retention of existing trees.",96,,
379,0.97,4280.376,4286.649,One of the response abilities is to ensure existing trees are being saved.,96,,
380,0.97,4286.649,4306.969,We have had so many conversations in this committee about the permitting process backlog and delays associated with our permitting process . I have to remain committed to those goals with bringing the work forward . I am leery of adding another layer on today.,96,,
381,0.97,4306.969,4320.816,"Every time the city imposes a new requirement for permanent, handling this the review time.",96,,
382,0.97,4320.816,4328.29,"If this was not already on the books, it would feel very differently.",96,,
383,0.97,4328.29,4331.96,"I just want to center my appreciation for you, Councilmember Pedersen and your team for bringing this forward.",96,,
384,0.97,4331.96,4337.366,I will let you move the amendment if you so desire.,96,,
385,0.97,4337.366,4351.246,I move amendment three to Council bill 120207 as presented on today's agenda.,97,,
386,0.97,4351.246,4353.282,Is there a second?,98,,
387,0.97,4353.282,4353.682,Second.,99,,
388,0.97,4353.682,4367.096,It has been moved and Seconded as shown in amendment three.,100,,
389,0.97,4367.096,4369.765,"Before a move for a vote, we wanted further discussion.",100,,
390,0.97,4369.765,4370.766,Is that correct?,100,,
391,0.97,4370.766,4373.335,"Vice chair Morales, please take it away.",101,,
392,0.97,4373.335,4377.239,Still on.,101,,
393,0.97,4377.239,4380.909,Sorry about that.,102,,
394,0.97,4380.909,4385.18,I did have a brief conversation with Councilmember Pedersen about this.,102,,
395,0.97,4385.18,4395.958,I am not sure if he or Yolanda would like to answer these questions.,102,,
396,0.97,4395.958,4406.502,"If the intent is to maximize retention of trees, then my questions are, when is the report do?",102,,
397,0.97,4406.502,4413.008,How long do these kinds of reports take? would something like this delay the project?,102,,
398,0.97,4413.008,4425.988,Is the requirement to submit the report to delay or to prevent the jury from getting cut down?,102,,
399,0.97,4425.988,4429.758,Is it just to provide information?,102,,
400,0.97,4429.758,4433.128,It does not sound to me like it is required to get approval to the jury down.,102,,
401,0.97,4433.128,4435.764,That makes me wonder what the point is.,102,,
402,0.97,4435.764,4444.239,Maybe if you can walk me through the information we would gather from this and what purpose it would serve.,102,,
403,0.97,4444.239,4445.908,Sure.,103,,
404,0.97,4445.908,4455.25,"As I had mentioned before, the subdivision process--it is not permitting actual development.",103,,
405,0.97,4455.25,4458.854,It would not permit removal of trees.,103,,
406,0.97,4458.854,4475.971,"That process is for a developer to show how the lots will be drawn . as a part of the approval of that flat map, this report would be required.",103,,
407,0.97,4475.971,4485.347,"Prior to Sdci saying the subdivision looks good, this would be a new report added to that process.",103,,
408,0.97,4485.347,4493.255,"In terms of what the report is exactly, that is up to Sdci.",103,,
409,0.97,4493.255,4522.084,"In my former life as a landscape architect, I could imagine writing a brief paragraph saying that this is drawn into such a way that this North lot was Configured so that this specific tree was in the corner verses in the center of the lot, something like that.",103,,
410,0.97,4522.084,4538.533,"It is intentionally vague to give Sdci some space to decide what it is that they would think is helpful, in terms of decision-making and reviewing the flat map that is proposed.",103,,
411,0.97,4538.533,4541.77,Is that helpful?,103,,
412,0.97,4541.77,4544.373,Yeah.,104,,
413,0.97,4544.373,4546.542,I appreciate it.,104,,
414,0.97,4546.542,4563.325,I think I am--I still have--this feels like an extra layer that does not give us a whole lot of information and could potentially delay projects.,104,,
415,0.97,4563.325,4565.894,I am not sure I can support this right now.,104,,
416,0.97,4565.894,4568.597,Thank you.,104,,
417,0.97,4568.597,4572.2,Thank you vice chair.,105,,
418,0.97,4572.2,4574.303,Councilmember Mosqueda?,105,,
419,0.97,4574.303,4575.504,Thank you very much.,106,,
420,0.97,4575.504,4584.646,A possible question as central staff.,106,,
421,0.97,4584.646,4591.353,It is my understanding that Sdci is currently reporting retention policies for subdivision and boundary line adjustments . is that the case?,106,,
422,0.97,4591.353,4595.223,There is an existing policy.,107,,
423,0.97,4595.223,4605.167,"As part of the approval process, the Sdci director shall consider how the proposal maximizes the retention of existing trees.",107,,
424,0.97,4605.167,4605.767,You are correct.,107,,
425,0.97,4605.767,4609.171,That is an existing policy.,107,,
426,0.97,4609.171,4619.982,"To the sponsor and the chair and the committee, I think this was an interesting concept.",108,,
427,0.97,4619.982,4636.331,"I am supportive of the intent to make sure those retention policies are robust . I am hoping that this might be something that we continue to flush out a little bit more, given the ongoing tree protection ordinances that we will be considering later this year.",108,,
428,0.97,4636.331,4663.258,"I would be interested in hearing from the Department directly about to what extent Sdci is seeing a problem with the current approach, whether we can look for ways to strengthen that enforcement in the upcoming tree enforcement ordinance and how we can strengthen that without adding additional time or processes to the existing permitting process which equals additional costs.",108,,
429,0.97,4663.258,4668.764,I do appreciate the intent here.,108,,
430,0.97,4668.764,4676.171,"For me as well, the concern for amendment number three without that additional feedback from the Department is the potential for unintended consequences and slowing down the permitting process.",108,,
431,0.97,4676.171,4688.25,I am looking forward to hearing more about how we can avoid unintended impact on cost and Timeline as well as make sure we are protecting those boundaries.,108,,
432,0.97,4688.25,4689.651,Thank you Councilmember Mosqueda.,109,,
433,0.97,4689.651,4695.557,Any further comments on the amendment?,109,,
434,0.97,4695.557,4698.393,"Councilmember Pedersen, would you like the last word?",109,,
435,0.97,4698.393,4698.994,Thank you.,110,,
436,0.97,4698.994,4703.865,I appreciate the questions and the comments from all of you.,110,,
437,0.97,4703.865,4712.407,Councilmember Mosqueda's vision of trying to look at this in a comprehensive manner as we move forward as well.,110,,
438,0.97,4712.407,4720.749,One of the concerns from some in the community is Sdci is put in a difficult position.,110,,
439,0.97,4720.749,4725.42,They are required to do so many difficult things with the project.,110,,
440,0.97,4725.42,4730.692,There is a movement out there.,110,,
441,0.97,4730.692,4741.369,"This was just a small step to say, let's be more mindful and creative earlier in the process so that we can do both, maximize unit centuries.",110,,
442,0.97,4741.369,4746.942,That won't happen on its own.,110,,
443,0.97,4746.942,4756.485,This was a way of doing it where we have the expertise and the landscape architect or Arborist to open briefly about how they are maximizing.,110,,
444,0.97,4756.485,4775.804,That could in fact help the Sdci director make a better decision if they are informed by that expertise early on by the landscape architect for the Arborist when there is a lot line adjustment.,110,,
445,0.97,4775.804,4779.975,"I'm sure if this does not pass today, we will see something like it later on the process.",110,,
446,0.97,4779.975,4782.711,Thank you.,110,,
447,0.97,4782.711,4784.012,"Thank you, council member Pedersen.",111,,

464,0.97,4819.881,4830.025,I think it has been echoed loud and clear we all support the intent of Councilmember Pedersen and we look forward to working with you on this further.,123,,
465,0.97,4830.025,4849.811,Our final amendment today is amendment four which would change the requirement that public notice be given for three days from just three days to three business days to avoid a scenario in which a notice is posted on a Friday for a Monday removal.,123,,
466,0.97,4849.811,4858.053,It also requires that the notice include additional information such as a copy of the tree service provider's registration and whether a permit is required for the removal or not.,123,,
467,0.97,4858.053,4863.725,It also clarifies that the hiring entity with the property owner or manager is responsible for posting the notice.,123,,
468,0.97,4863.725,4870.465,"Yolanda, did I Miss anything with that?",123,,
469,0.97,4870.465,4878.373,One minor thing is that the tree service provider would provide said notice to the hiring entity.,124,,
470,0.97,4878.373,4880.609,"That is one small thing but otherwise, you got it all.",124,,
471,0.97,4880.609,4882.811,Thank you.,125,,
472,0.97,4882.811,4892.587,"Colleagues, any questions, discussion before we vote on this amendment?",125,,

498,0.97,4958.186,4976.871,"I did not get a chance to comment on the substitute as we voted but the substitute is a great combination of amendments that address some of the equity concerns that we have regarding small, Bipoc, immigrant owned businesses to make sure that there is the ability to collaborate and work with certified Arborists.",139,,
499,0.97,4976.871,4986.047,I appreciate the inclusion of an option to have an Arborist for retention that will achieve the same end of having that expertise on hand while not creating a barrier for those small businesses.,139,,
500,0.97,4986.047,4999.627,"I did want to ask Mr. chair, of central staff, something I am going to start doing as more of a practice in our committees that we participate in.",139,,
501,0.97,4999.627,5005.5,It is asking central staff to lift up before final passage fiscal notes so that we have an opportunity one more time.,139,,
502,0.97,5005.5,5019.247,Obviously this is something that I should have called out in the initial briefing of the legislation but we will be doing so as a more routine basis as we look at final passage.,139,,
503,0.97,5019.247,5027.055,"Yolanda, thanks again.",139,,
504,0.97,5027.055,5037.999,"You noted that, depending on the extent of Rulemaking by the director of Sdci to implement the ordinance, there may be city position commitments needed to implement the registration requirement.",139,,
505,0.97,5037.999,5039.3,Depending on the number of complaints received.,139,,
506,0.97,5039.3,5047.175,"I am wondering if we might just have you elaborate on that for a quick second, given the budget situation that we are all in as a city family.",139,,
507,0.97,5047.175,5062.424,We are looking forward to opportunities to Mindfully move forward important legislation like this as well as couple these discussions on policy with the fiscal impacts since we don't have a traditional system.,139,,
508,0.97,5062.424,5066.861,"I know that is something you were advocating for last year, to have a policy committee and a fiscal committee.",139,,
509,0.97,5066.861,5090.318,"I would love to take a second, if you might, for central staff to help us identify any additional considerations around the fiscal NOTE and if there is a possible funding source . This is not intended to be a roadblock or a pushing pause conversation.",139,,
510,0.97,5090.318,5105.066,I want to make sure folks know this is something I will be asking about legislation but it is a great opportunity for us to show the legislation while also lifting up the fiscal impact and being mindful of that as we look at the constraints facing us in this upcoming budget session.,139,,
511,0.97,5105.066,5112.974,I would note that Sdci is a largely permit fee supported Department.,140,,
512,0.97,5112.974,5122.517,"I do not know to what extent that they have their ways of calculating, whether it be general Fund, permit fee supported.",140,,
513,0.97,5122.517,5144.939,The hope would be that most of the FTE--there is a body of work that the complaints and dealing with that may be general fund supported but there is a body of work that cannot be permit fee supported.,140,,
514,0.97,5144.939,5147.709,The vast majority of the work there is permit fee supported.,140,,
515,0.97,5147.709,5158.353,It will be good for us to understand how much of that ongoing work can be permit fee supported versus on the general fund.,140,,
516,0.97,5158.353,5172.3,"That will be, to be determined, as Sdci gets this up and running and starts to see what the asks of it are and all of those things.",140,,
517,0.97,5172.3,5173.735,We don't quite know.,140,,
518,0.97,5173.735,5190.985,"If you look at the fiscal note of this bill, it will not be particularly informative because I am waiting on Sdci's analysis to help inform the Council on the fiscal impacts.",140,,
519,0.97,5190.985,5191.586,Thank you.,141,,
520,0.97,5191.586,5201.729,I am glad to know that there is a possible revenue source and I think that will be helpful for the broader conversation that we hope to have later this year.,141,,
521,0.97,5201.729,5202.797,Thank you very much.,141,,
522,0.97,5202.797,5209.504,"Councilmember Mosqueda, very well said as chair of the Finance Committee.",142,,
523,0.97,5209.504,5214.142,I think that the attention is spot on.,142,,
524,0.97,5214.142,5231.392,"One thing I have noticed in the tree work that we have been doing from a policy level is that when enforcement is conducted for folks that have broken the rules, cutting down trees in environmentally critical areas or without permits, there are fines levied against them.",142,,
525,0.97,5231.392,5242.971,"Those fines are returned to the general fund at large, rather than being retained for tree planting, tree maintenance, or even just this work we are discussing.",142,,
526,0.97,5242.971,5263.691,"There are more ways that we are able to protect trees . What is happening right now, the fines will be levied as a deterrent yet those dollars are not helping to Regrow our city's canopy.",142,,
527,0.97,5263.691,5266.127,"With that, Councilmember Pedersen, any final words?",143,,
528,0.97,5266.127,5267.895,I have nothing to add.,144,,

556,0.97,5351.612,5359.754,This would ratify the reasoning adopted Countywide policies for King County.,161,,
557,0.97,5359.754,5362.223,The city can ratify these policies by resolution or by taking no action.,161,,

635,0.97,5774.802,5777.671,Is there precedent for Seattle not ratifying these policies?,173,,
636,0.97,5777.671,5786.78,I did some research along those lines when drafting the resolution.,174,,

639,0.97,5798.726,5806.934,That was sort of historic at this point.,174,,
640,0.97,5806.934,5811.005,Folks in the county overall are hearing back from various cities about whether or not they want to ratify it.,174,,

668,0.97,5905.566,5905.966,Thank you.,189,,
669,0.97,5905.966,5912.239,The motion carries.,189,,
670,0.97,5912.239,5914.275,Resolution 32048 passes.,189,,
671,0.97,5914.275,5919.813,This legislation will be on Tuesday for a final vote.,189,,
672,0.97,5919.813,5921.515,Our final business today is a briefing.,189,,
673,0.97,5921.515,5935.696,It's a briefing on The-I always lead with Maritime and industrial strategies but they switch it up on me.,189,,
674,0.97,5935.696,5936.964,Work that the economic development is doing.,189,,
675,0.97,5936.964,5942.436,Please read the abbreviated title into the record.,189,,
676,0.97,5942.436,5943.938,The industrial for Maritime and strategy reports.,190,,
677,0.97,5943.938,5946.94,Thank you.,191,,
678,0.97,5946.94,5958.452,Before introducing yourselves I will mention this was a process that was led by the Mayor.,191,,
679,0.97,5958.452,5960.888,There was an 87% consensus on the recommendations.,191,,
680,0.97,5960.888,5970.998,There were a few people that did not agree with the recommendations.,191,,
681,0.97,5970.998,5976.337,"And what I said at the time of people voting on whether or not to support recommendations, there were a couple of things that I needed.",191,,
682,0.97,5976.337,5984.645,I needed the Mayor to take the public issues in the industrial area seriously and address it.,191,,
683,0.97,5984.645,5989.984,"Secondly, the recommendations will be taken as a whole package.",191,,
684,0.97,5989.984,6002.129,We are waiting for the environmental impact statement to be resolved before we take up the aspects of legislation that we can pick up Legislatively.,191,,
685,0.97,6002.129,6021.015,With all that said I think that it is important that members of the committee began digesting and understanding information within this proposal because it is a long document and there is a lot of information that needs to be understood.,191,,
686,0.97,6021.015,6022.015,We should get to that now.,191,,
687,0.97,6022.015,6024.451,Not everyone on this committee was part of that process.,191,,
688,0.97,6024.451,6031.992,"With all that said, we've got some really great folks here.",191,,
689,0.97,6031.992,6032.626,We have economic development.,191,,
690,0.97,6032.626,6039.733,I'm looking forward to who our Sdot liaison is.,191,,
691,0.97,6039.733,6041.201,I'm not seeing it at the moment.,191,,
692,0.97,6041.201,6043.637,I'm going to pass it over to Jim.,191,,
693,0.97,6043.637,6052.212,Take it away.,191,,
694,0.97,6052.212,6055.082,Representing Sdot as part of the project team here.,192,,
695,0.97,6055.082,6064.658,I will share my screen to pull up the presentation.,192,,
696,0.97,6064.658,6065.059,All right.,192,,
697,0.97,6065.059,6072.032,I'm here to talk about the industrial Maritime strategy.,192,,
698,0.97,6072.032,6076.303,Today we are going to talk about why this strategy is important.,192,,
699,0.97,6076.303,6081.008,The process and implementation action was to date.,192,,
700,0.97,6081.008,6093.287,We are going to get into the proposed Land-Use concepts and EIS alternatives and some of the EIS discussion.,192,,
701,0.97,6093.287,6096.957,I think the importance of this plan is really reflected by the importance of industrial land in the city.,192,,
702,0.97,6096.957,6105.599,We have two regionally designated manufacturing industrial centers.,192,,
703,0.97,6105.599,6121.682,-- this designation is a regional designation by Psrc and it is a priority plan and has funding in these areas.,192,,
704,0.97,6121.682,6124.118,Recertification of our designation is due in 2025.,192,,
705,0.97,6124.118,6134.294,"We know that right now there is an excess of 95,000 existing jobs within the industry.",192,,
706,0.97,6134.294,6137.898,Two thirds of these jobs are accessible without a four-year degree.,192,,
707,0.97,6137.898,6140.634,Many remain unionized with quality benefits.,192,,
708,0.97,6140.634,6149.243,Starting salaries can exceed 70% of the area median income in key fields.,192,,
709,0.97,6149.243,6155.315,Part of our industrial lands are the irreplaceable assets.,192,,
710,0.97,6155.315,6161.622,The Deepwater and port waterways.,192,,
711,0.97,6161.622,6175.435,"The process to date, in 2016, a group was convened that looked at industrial land use surrounding the St3 station in that area.",192,,
712,0.97,6175.435,6177.271,That work went on for a couple of years.,192,,
713,0.97,6177.271,6179.64,It concluded with a couple of Graft recommendations.,192,,
714,0.97,6179.64,6183.577,Which in some ways informed the next process but they were not adopted.,192,,
715,0.97,6183.577,6198.025,"The citywide strategy counsel that these recommendations come from, as convened in fall of 2019, it was issued by the departmental team.",192,,
716,0.97,6198.025,6207.367,"Opcd, Sdot, Osce, Spu, and other city families as needed.",192,,
717,0.97,6207.367,6208.969,They were professionally facilitated.,192,,
718,0.97,6208.969,6215.609,It included four neighborhood subgroups.,192,,
719,0.97,6215.609,6219.746,"One for Ballard, one for Interbay, one for Duwamish, and one for the Georgetown South Park committees.",192,,
720,0.97,6219.746,6226.52,It also included engagement with by Pock youth.,192,,
721,0.97,6226.52,6236.096,In June of 2021 this group adopted consensus recommendations.,192,,
722,0.97,6236.096,6245.305,"11 strategies, the comprised industrial and Maritime strategies.",192,,
723,0.97,6245.305,6246.54,It was in the 2022 budget.,192,,
724,0.97,6246.54,6253.046,We also launched the EIS addressing the Land-Use recommendations last summer.,192,,
725,0.97,6253.046,6257.951,"The 11 strategies, and I will keep this high-level, involved investment strategies.",192,,
726,0.97,6257.951,6267.127,Making workforce investments to help develop a skilled workforce to work in our Odessa areas.,192,,
727,0.97,6267.127,6289.75,"Public safety partnerships, increased public safety, industrial areas, transportation investments, environmental initiatives, what they call action items which include a recommendation of whatever happens at the Interbay area site is working in a massive planning process with the state on those.",192,,
728,0.97,6289.75,6296.99,And finally recognizing the need for a stewardship group to really advance the interests of our industrial areas.,192,,
729,0.97,6296.99,6304.564,The Land-Use strategies include stronger protections for industrial land.,192,,
730,0.97,6304.564,6313.407,Promoting dense industrial development.,192,,
731,0.97,6313.407,6321.314,Enhancing healthy transition areas.,192,,
732,0.97,6321.314,6328.455,I will talk more about that in a minute.,192,,
733,0.97,6328.455,6333.994,"There is a consensus that, generally speaking in our core and industrial zones, there will be no residential uses.",192,,
734,0.97,6333.994,6340.867,Some select areas of Georgetown and Southpark were identified for removal to advance the neighborhood goals.,192,,
735,0.97,6340.867,6347.307,We started the EIS process last summer.,192,,
736,0.97,6347.307,6348.608,In July.,192,,
737,0.97,6348.608,6349.242,Sorry to interrupt.,193,,
738,0.97,6349.242,6351.011,Could we go back to that last slide?,193,,
739,0.97,6351.011,6357.851,I just wanted to hang on this for a minute to see if colleagues have questions on this.,193,,
740,0.97,6357.851,6359.486,Or would you prefer questions at the end?,193,,
741,0.97,6359.486,6360.887,I'm fine either way.,194,,
742,0.97,6360.887,6366.393,"Colleagues, I was well versed in these because I was in the process where consensus came to these ideas.",195,,
743,0.97,6366.393,6371.732,I just wanted to pause here to see if there is additional information.,195,,
744,0.97,6371.732,6373.166,Vice chair Tammy Morales.,195,,
745,0.97,6373.166,6380.707,Talk about Georgetown and Southpark being removed.,196,,
746,0.97,6380.707,6389.549,I've had lots of conversation with folks in Georgetown that were very nervous about industrial lands.,196,,
747,0.97,6389.549,6392.986,The residential parts of Georgetown having industrial lands expanded into the residential area.,196,,
748,0.97,6392.986,6395.822,I know that industrial folks don't want residential moving into their area.,196,,
749,0.97,6395.822,6403.029,Talk to me about that conversation about removing Georgetown from it.,196,,
750,0.97,6403.029,6406.9,Most of Georgetown is not within it.,197,,
751,0.97,6406.9,6408.802,There is a small area that extends.,197,,
752,0.97,6408.802,6423.016,"It is bound by airport ways, kind of a triangle shaped area, that we propose we study for removal.",197,,
753,0.97,6423.016,6424.985,I think it is like the Georgetown Cbd.,197,,
754,0.97,6424.985,6431.425,They may be used for mixed housing.,197,,
755,0.97,6431.425,6434.628,We have studied it and that's what came out of this Stakeholder process.,197,,
756,0.97,6434.628,6438.932,"In Southpark there is an area, there is a park.",197,,
757,0.97,6438.932,6441.968,I will show you on a map and a few slides of the area.,197,,
758,0.97,6441.968,6449.209,"We just need a better connection between the park and the downtown, to the rivers edge.",197,,
759,0.97,6449.209,6456.283,These small areas that I think are a total of four acres.,197,,
760,0.97,6456.283,6461.688,It was identified as a potential in our subgroups.,197,,
761,0.97,6461.688,6465.859,We are in the midst of doing some extensive engagement in that community.,197,,
762,0.97,6465.859,6475.602,I think we will be able to come back with more information about various viewpoints in Southpark and Georgetown on those issues.,197,,
763,0.97,6475.602,6480.707,Okay.,198,,
764,0.97,6480.707,6481.408,Thank you.,198,,
765,0.97,6481.408,6487.781,"Don, I don't know if you want to add anything there, as a resident of Georgetown.",198,,
766,0.97,6487.781,6492.285,I would just echo what Jim was saying.,199,,
767,0.97,6492.285,6502.295,I am unaware of anything on the table that would expand the Mic boundaries into anything that is not a Mic boundary.,199,,
768,0.97,6502.295,6504.764,I think I wanted to highlight that and make that clear.,199,,
769,0.97,6504.764,6511.671,Thank you.,200,,
770,0.97,6511.671,6512.305,All right.,201,,
771,0.97,6512.305,6513.106,Shall we move on?,201,,
772,0.97,6513.106,6519.746,Sure.,202,,
773,0.97,6519.746,6525.852,We started the EIS process last summer.,203,,
774,0.97,6525.852,6527.32,We held a Scoping in the summer.,203,,
775,0.97,6527.32,6528.488,That process started in early July.,203,,
776,0.97,6528.488,6532.259,During that period we did an extensive outreach to different Stakeholder groups to make sure they understood the process.,203,,
777,0.97,6532.259,6533.927,In early August the Scoping period it concluded.,203,,
778,0.97,6533.927,6538.999,We prepared the final scope for the draft EIS and work began on that.,203,,
779,0.97,6538.999,6542.502,"We released the draft EIS in December, December 16th of 2021.",203,,
780,0.97,6542.502,6546.139,With a 45 day comment period.,203,,
781,0.97,6546.139,6553.28,Based on the requests we received from the public we had extended it to 75 days.,203,,
782,0.97,6553.28,6558.551,We actually extended it further for the Georgetown and South Park communities.,203,,
783,0.97,6558.551,6566.56,We anticipate a final EIS will be complete late in the second quarter.,203,,
784,0.97,6566.56,6571.531,And following that it is our hope that we will be able to transmit comprehensive plan amendments.,203,,
785,0.97,6571.531,6578.338,So we will begin Land-Use recommendations for this year's annual amendment cycle.,203,,
786,0.97,6578.338,6579.172,"Thank you, Jim.",204,,
787,0.97,6579.172,6581.441,Real quick on that.,204,,
788,0.97,6581.441,6585.512,Maybe I Conflated some things here in my earlier comments.,204,,
789,0.97,6585.512,6590.216,My apologies if I did.,204,,
790,0.97,6590.216,6597.958,"Just given that we saw appeals to the previous decisions on some of these recommendations, how would this time be impacted with any potential appeal?",204,,
791,0.97,6597.958,6604.464,Those appeals were received last year.,205,,
792,0.97,6604.464,6612.639,"We decided to withdraw the legislation and are studying this, which was actually the request of the appeals last year.",205,,
793,0.97,6612.639,6614.04,We have still given an appeal.,205,,
794,0.97,6614.04,6615.108,That will definitely add a delay.,205,,
795,0.97,6615.108,6625.585,We will not be transmitting conference of plans if we do receive the Pil on an EIS by 2023.,205,,
796,0.97,6625.585,6630.957,Great.,206,,
797,0.97,6630.957,6631.591,Thank you.,206,,
798,0.97,6631.591,6643.37,"What the EIS is studying, what the recommendations of the Stakeholder group are for was to look at three new Land-Use concepts that would become zones in our industrial area to replace the existing zones.",207,,
799,0.97,6643.37,6645.839,The first one is the Maritime manufacturing and logistics zone.,207,,
800,0.97,6645.839,6654.014,That is really our core and industrial zone.,207,,
801,0.97,6654.014,6657.05,Most land that is currently in the IG zoning category would be in this category.,207,,
802,0.97,6657.05,6669.729,The industry and innovation is really a response to what we can do about Land-Use surrounding the future of transit stations and industrial areas.,207,,
803,0.97,6669.729,6671.765,I will go on to more details in a few minutes.,207,,
804,0.97,6671.765,6679.639,The urban industrials really create vibrant transition districts where industrial land transitions.,207,,
805,0.97,6679.639,6682.609,The Maritime manufacturing logistics concept.,207,,
806,0.97,6682.609,6689.315,These are the core industrial areas that benefit by the proximity to the port.,207,,
807,0.97,6689.315,6691.051,"To that rail infrastructure, freight infrastructure.",207,,
808,0.97,6691.051,6710.336,"With the stronger protections that we will be proposing to the comprehensive plan, these are areas that businesses would feel that it is economically reasonable to invest on site and continue operations in these areas.",207,,
809,0.97,6710.336,6720.814,"The industry innovation concept is what we would place around transit stations, around some transit stations.",207,,
810,0.97,6720.814,6722.882,This is kind of an idea to go with industrial use.,207,,
811,0.97,6722.882,6736.696,What you see in this diagram is the first few floors of these buildings . They are gray.,207,,
812,0.97,6736.696,6738.498,"This will be the industrial space, light industrial space.",207,,
813,0.97,6738.498,6741.334,There would be development standards requiring them to be built to industrial standards.,207,,
814,0.97,6741.334,6745.638,And then there is the incentive that would allow commercial development.,207,,
815,0.97,6745.638,6752.245,These could be 10 to 12 story buildings with fairly generous floor plates.,207,,
816,0.97,6752.245,6762.422,The idea is to get employment density using this station.,207,,
817,0.97,6762.422,6763.99,We would apply for the requirements.,207,,
818,0.97,6763.99,6764.39,Limited parking.,207,,
819,0.97,6764.39,6769.729,All of the things that you would see in the traditional.,207,,
820,0.97,6769.729,6773.466,"And finally for the industrial complex, these are the transitional areas.",207,,
821,0.97,6773.466,6783.743,Areas around the Ballard district is a good example.,207,,
822,0.97,6783.743,6794.287,"If you have increasing residence from the adjacent areas coming into the industrial area, they may go to tap rooms.",207,,
823,0.97,6794.287,6796.322,There are spaces.,207,,
824,0.97,6796.322,6802.829,Things that draw people in rather than traditional industrial areas.,207,,
825,0.97,6802.829,6811.871,So we would envision better designs to eliminate safety hazards and conflicts between pedestrians and freight movement.,207,,
826,0.97,6811.871,6816.609,We would allow these areas to continue to serve the community.,207,,
827,0.97,6816.609,6822.482,A little background on the EIS.,207,,
828,0.97,6822.482,6823.283,There are range alternatives.,207,,
829,0.97,6823.283,6833.526,Different choices that we can make that identify the potential adverse impacts on the built in natural environment.,207,,
830,0.97,6833.526,6836.996,We will have a range alternatives and understand policy Trade-Offs between the choices that can be made.,207,,
831,0.97,6836.996,6837.831,Choices that you will make.,207,,
832,0.97,6837.831,6848.274,"And then Finally, we understand that by also including the no action alternative, what is the impact over 20 years if nothing changes.",207,,
833,0.97,6848.274,6856.783,We will show you two alternatives.,207,,
834,0.97,6856.783,6858.618,They both span the range of the alternatives.,207,,
835,0.97,6858.618,6859.953,This is the no action alternative.,207,,
836,0.97,6859.953,6863.489,"As you can see, 90% of the land is currently in the industrial general category.",207,,
837,0.97,6863.489,6869.395,5% is industrial and commercial.,207,,
838,0.97,6869.395,6872.131,"These are the areas that you see in Expedia, Fremont, North of I-90.",207,,
839,0.97,6872.131,6879.005,"And then the industrial buffer, which doesn't show great on this map.",207,,
840,0.97,6879.005,6880.039,That is the transitional zone.,207,,
841,0.97,6880.039,6881.741,As you can see there is Ballard.,207,,
842,0.97,6881.741,6885.178,Let me get this out of my way.,207,,
843,0.97,6885.178,6887.313,"You can see at around Southpark, around this entry here.",207,,
844,0.97,6887.313,6892.518,You can see it surrounding Georgetown.,207,,
845,0.97,6892.518,6892.919,That's 5%.,207,,
846,0.97,6892.919,6896.389,"So I'm showing you now, as the alternative with the greatest amount of change.",207,,
847,0.97,6896.389,6905.999,"So this one, the Maritime manufacturing and logistics zone has replaced most.",207,,
848,0.97,6905.999,6907.433,It comprises 86% of total land area.,207,,
849,0.97,6907.433,6919.479,In this alternative the industry innovation zone comprises of about 8% . So you see that around this station.,207,,
850,0.97,6919.479,6922.115,It extends down to the Starbucks center and continues North along six.,207,,
851,0.97,6922.115,6925.451,You can see the existing industrial commercial areas.,207,,
852,0.97,6925.451,6926.419,Places in this zone category.,207,,
853,0.97,6926.419,6927.42,It is the closest fit.,207,,
854,0.97,6927.42,6934.594,"You can see it by a potential Ballard station, using 14th Avenue.",207,,
855,0.97,6934.594,6944.47,"In this alternative there are focus areas of land from Georgetown, as we discussed, and Southpark.",207,,
856,0.97,6944.47,6949.075,These are very small areas.,207,,
857,0.97,6949.075,6954.18,It allows an increase.,207,,
858,0.97,6954.18,6961.754,There are no new residential uses being proposed.,207,,
859,0.97,6961.754,6967.46,This is the one that studies the most housing.,207,,
860,0.97,6967.46,6979.272,"We would expand the caretaker areas from one business, to as high as 50 per acre.",207,,
861,0.97,6979.272,6981.607,It needs to be part of the project with industrial activity.,207,,
862,0.97,6981.607,6991.117,With this alternative we can see as many as 2000 new dwelling units within the mix.,207,,
863,0.97,6991.117,7004.03,As we have gone through this process the Georgetown and Southpark communities reached out and felt that they really needed a little more in terms of the kind of outreach that would help the residents in those areas participate in this process.,207,,
864,0.97,7004.03,7009.769,So we extended the comment period to April 15th.,207,,
865,0.97,7009.769,7027.82,"We are working with the collaboration, the neighborhood organizations, to reach out to the residents in these neighborhoods because they experience greater impact of productivity.",207,,
866,0.97,7027.82,7029.655,We will have two community meetings next week.,207,,
867,0.97,7029.655,7030.99,One and Southpark and one in Georgetown.,207,,
868,0.97,7030.99,7033.726,We will also have a virtual meeting for anyone that wants to Login.,207,,
869,0.97,7033.726,7035.428,Then we have a series of drop in hours.,207,,
870,0.97,7035.428,7048.875,Very informal events where there will be a couple members of city staff and a coffee shop with materials for a few hours where people can drop by and talk to us and ask questions.,207,,
871,0.97,7048.875,7055.114,"We are providing translation services for many of these events in Spanish, Somali, and Vietnamese.",207,,
872,0.97,7055.114,7060.119,The next steps.,207,,
873,0.97,7060.119,7064.223,"We are preparing the final EIS for release at the end of the second quarter, 2022.",207,,
874,0.97,7064.223,7070.663,Assuming no appeal we would submit conference of plan amendments for 2022.,207,,
875,0.97,7070.663,7074.167,We would prepare zoning regulations for consideration in 2023.,207,,
876,0.97,7074.167,7094.22,"We would update the center's plans for the Duwamish Mic, which is a Recertification of their manufacturing and industrial centers . that concludes the presentation.",207,,
877,0.97,7094.22,7094.62,Wonderful.,208,,
878,0.97,7094.62,7095.021,"Thank you, Jim.",208,,
879,0.97,7095.021,7098.691,"John, anything to add there?",208,,
880,0.97,7098.691,7100.726,You are an active participant in a different role.,208,,
881,0.97,7100.726,7105.631,We are glad to have you to keep this work moving.,208,,
882,0.97,7105.631,7110.303,"Sure, Councilmember Strauss.",209,,
883,0.97,7110.303,7110.603,Thank you.,209,,
884,0.97,7110.603,7113.573,I guess the only thing I could add is more of a philosophical note.,209,,
885,0.97,7113.573,7118.978,Just in terms of how many of these areas have evolved over the years.,209,,
886,0.97,7118.978,7130.356,You have a conflict between the sense of place and what is actually happening in these areas versus the utility of Maritime and manufacturing.,209,,
887,0.97,7130.356,7135.261,For a number of years we have kicked the can down the road.,209,,
888,0.97,7135.261,7160.353,I think we have reached a point where we really need to bring out the data and to really understand what we are dealing with so that we can make a decision and resolve a lot of these Long-Standing differences of opinion and misunderstandings and conflicts around various places around the mix.,209,,
889,0.97,7160.353,7164.023,Also a key part of the industrial Maritime strategy is the workforce piece.,209,,
890,0.97,7164.023,7171.597,"That, unfortunately, is not contingent on many of the outcomes in this environmental impact.",209,,
891,0.97,7171.597,7178.971,"From the perspective of Oed, we can do workforce development now.",209,,
892,0.97,7178.971,7187.547,We can Prioritize the recommendations and the policies.,209,,
893,0.97,7187.547,7189.515,The policy table that supports the recommendation for workforce development.,209,,
894,0.97,7189.515,7193.452,We can begin to take a look at those and implement some of those and find some of those.,209,,
895,0.97,7193.452,7195.054,That's all I have to say on that.,209,,
896,0.97,7195.054,7199.926,I will just cut it off here.,209,,
897,0.97,7199.926,7200.226,Thank you.,209,,
898,0.97,7200.226,7201.16,"Well said, John.",210,,
899,0.97,7201.16,7203.396,I was on mute just a second ago as I started speaking.,210,,
900,0.97,7203.396,7205.464,Thank you for those comments.,210,,
901,0.97,7205.464,7207.3,"Colleagues, do you have further questions or comments?",210,,
902,0.97,7207.3,7211.571,We can have this information back before the Council event.,210,,
903,0.97,7211.571,7215.474,"Chairman Tammy Morales, take it away.",210,,
904,0.97,7215.474,7226.485,"And Jim and John, thank you very much for being here and sharing the process that you went through and some of the initial alternatives that you offer to bring.",211,,
905,0.97,7226.485,7229.121,I think this is really more of a statement.,211,,
906,0.97,7229.121,7230.556,I just want to say two things.,211,,
907,0.97,7230.556,7250.576,"The first is that, for us as policymakers, it's important that we assess the economic impact in addition to the environmental impact and the industry and sector impacts in order for us to make a sound decision.",211,,
908,0.97,7250.576,7254.013,Can you talk about whether there will be any analysis of the economic impacts of these changes?,211,,
909,0.97,7254.013,7262.521,I'm especially interested in understanding the different impacts on the two.,211,,
910,0.97,7262.521,7271.297,I do anticipate that there will be disproportionate benefits and impacts in Duwamish.,211,,
911,0.97,7271.297,7273.132,It's a very varied area.,211,,
912,0.97,7273.132,7278.804,"Especially as it relates to transportation, job growth.",211,,
913,0.97,7278.804,7285.544,It will be important as we move through this process to differentiate between the two parts of town.,211,,
914,0.97,7285.544,7294.32,I don't have to tell you that there is a legacy of contamination in the Duwamish.,211,,
915,0.97,7294.32,7300.626,We have folks that do some fishing in the Duwamish.,211,,
916,0.97,7300.626,7321.38,"I think it's going to be important, over the next year or two, to be very intentional about calling out to the different impacts that these changes will have on our communities.",211,,
917,0.97,7321.38,7327.219,We have done an abbreviated economics study that is about employment projections of the different alternatives.,212,,
918,0.97,7327.219,7333.192,"That's on our Website, and I can send that to you to make sure you have it.",212,,
919,0.97,7333.192,7346.906,"A lot of the impact that I think you're talking about, impacts on housing supply, the need for housing, the impacts of increased traffic as these areas continue in terms of air quality and noise.",212,,
920,0.97,7346.906,7360.519,"In terms of increased workforce, in terms of open space, much of that is in the draft EIS and sections of the environment.",212,,
921,0.97,7360.519,7365.925,It's a very dry document and I apologize for that.,212,,
922,0.97,7365.925,7375.568,"If there are areas you are specifically interested in, the summary is a great map to know where to go to look at that document.",212,,
923,0.97,7375.568,7386.545,I would also add that there is an equity analysis that shows how the impacts on different elements of the environment are disproportionately affecting some areas more than others.,212,,
924,0.97,7386.545,7391.917,Which is also a useful tool to look at.,212,,
925,0.97,7391.917,7395.321,"Chair, if I may.",213,,
926,0.97,7395.321,7406.432,"The point I want to make, I know that we are talking about the industrial area and people don't necessarily live in these areas, but they live next to them.",213,,
927,0.97,7406.432,7414.907,I think it's still important to center the people who are going to be impacted by this.,213,,
928,0.97,7414.907,7420.312,Not just the businesses.,213,,
929,0.97,7420.312,7427.42,Not just--the fact that there are 14 stations going through this RAISES a whole set of other questions for me that we can talk about later.,213,,
930,0.97,7427.42,7440.099,"I do think that calling out the differences in the way the people in the surrounding communities will be impacted, whether it is access to jobs or housing.",213,,
931,0.97,7440.099,7452.678,"Health, air quality, water quality, noise, all of that is going to be different for people in the Duwamish then it will be for the other folks.",213,,
932,0.97,7452.678,7453.312,I don't know.,213,,
933,0.97,7453.312,7459.618,Maybe the chair and I can play a little bit of good cop bad cop here.,213,,
934,0.97,7459.618,7463.055,I think it's important to acknowledge that and to be ready to have those conversations.,213,,
935,0.97,7463.055,7469.028,Thank you.,214,,
936,0.97,7469.028,7470.429,"Thank you, vice chair.",215,,
937,0.97,7470.429,7471.463,Those conversations will come up.,215,,
938,0.97,7471.463,7477.77,Although there are a few hurdles that have to be overcome before it comes to us.,215,,
939,0.97,7477.77,7484.71,That's why I think that it's important for us to start by adjusting this now so that we don't try to do all of our learning at the last minute.,215,,
940,0.97,7484.71,7491.25,We will probably have Jim and John back with us before not too long to update us on how things are going.,215,,
941,0.97,7491.25,7495.02,"Colleagues, any other questions?",215,,
942,0.97,7495.02,7500.86,I'm seeing none.,215,,
943,0.97,7500.86,7502.328,"Jim, John, I really, really appreciate you coming.",215,,
944,0.97,7502.328,7514.24,I look forward to continuing following this work as the EIS process moves forward.,215,,
945,0.97,7514.24,7515.441,We look forward to having you back.,215,,
946,0.97,7515.441,7521.013,Thank you for your hard work on this because it has been a number of years worth of work that was put on pause by the pandemic.,215,,
947,0.97,7521.013,7523.215,It has restarted with a whole new set of challenges.,215,,
948,0.97,7523.215,7529.288,It was incredibly impressive to see such a range of opinions Úget to such a high threshold O agreement.,215,,
949,0.97,7529.288,7530.823,Even if it wasn't the perfect solution for everyone.,215,,
950,0.97,7530.823,7534.66,I think that's really what compromising consensus can build at times.,215,,
951,0.97,7534.66,7538.53,"Thank you, gentlemen.",215,,
952,0.97,7538.53,7541.834,Thank you to the Mayor's office for leading this work last year and the year before.,215,,
953,0.97,7541.834,7550.175,We will have you back.,215,,
954,0.97,7550.175,7550.476,Wonderful.,215,,
955,0.97,7550.476,7552.611,"Colleagues, if there is no other business I will conclude this meeting.",215,,
956,0.97,7552.611,7554.179,Anything for the good of the order?,215,,
957,0.97,7554.179,7558.551,I'm seeing none.,215,,
958,0.97,7558.551,7564.456,Before we conclude I will mention that the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Land- use Committee on April 13th will be canceled.,215,,
959,0.97,7564.456,7572.197,Our next Land-Use committee will be on April 27th starting at 2:00 P.M.,215,,
960,0.97,7572.197,7581.173,"With nothing further this does conclude the Wednesday, March 23rd 2022 meeting.",215,,
961,0.97,7581.173,7581.807,Thank you for meeting.,215,,
962,0.97,7581.807,7592.117,We are adjourned.,215,,
