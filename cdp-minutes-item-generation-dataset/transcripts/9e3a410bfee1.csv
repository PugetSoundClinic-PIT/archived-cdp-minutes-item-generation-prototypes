31,0.97,1027.359,1099.097,"So while Thecouncil is voting on whether or not to override the Mayor's veto today, I want to be really clear that I see my vote to override this veto as technical in nature because of the need for a replacement bill that I think addresses the position of the Mayor and the budget office as it relates to preserving additional emergency revenues in light of the recent revenue forecast, and also the concerns I've heard from the Mayor's office around insuring that there's flexibility within the bill that we're about to vote on, to make clear that that Council's intention is that the revenues be spent, but with an understanding that if they can't be spent either because of future financial short FALLS in 2020, or because of technical issues related to setting up new programs and funding, actually getting the money out the door, that we are intending to give them that flexibility.",2,,
32,0.97,1099.097,1110.242,But we can't vote on that other bill without taking an action on the veto before us today.,2,,
33,0.97,1110.242,1115.247,"As Council President Gonzalez said, it's a charter obligation to vote on this bill up or down.",2,,
34,0.97,1115.247,1120.552,"We don't have the ability to just put it aside, and introduce a new bill.",2,,
35,0.97,1120.552,1126.425,And the reason for that is because the Council's required to do our action in public.,2,,
36,0.97,1126.425,1140.706,"We can't just sort of unofficially say we're going to put this bill aside, and move forward a new bill that we have agreement with on, on the Mayor on some of the principles.",2,,
37,0.97,1140.706,1142.541,We're not permitted to do that.,2,,
38,0.97,1142.541,1147.679,The Mayor can allow legislation to go into effect without her signature.,2,,
39,0.97,1147.679,1156.655,We're obligated by the Charter and by the principles of open government of a legislative body to vote this veto up or down.,2,,
40,0.97,1156.655,1161.493,"But again, I see the vote on this veto as technical in nature.",2,,
41,0.97,1161.493,1170.602,It's technical in nature because it allows us to to vote on the substitute bill that we'll be talking about in a moment.,2,,
42,0.97,1170.602,1182.181,"If we don't vote on the veto, we can't vote on the substitute, because the substitute itself is an amendment of the vetoed bill.",2,,
43,0.97,1182.181,1194.326,"And under a different set of circumstances we could potentially introduce a new bill, but we simply don't have the time to do that.",2,,
44,0.97,1194.326,1199.665,"Under a different set of circumstances, we could vote to uphold the veto and introduce a new bill.",2,,
45,0.97,1199.665,1204.403,"But again, given the fact that we have a Council recess.",2,,
46,0.97,1204.403,1223.555,"Given that we don't have another introduction and referral calendar until next Monday, and not a lot of ability to schedule additional Council meetings before the Council goes on recess, this is the option before us today.",2,,
47,0.97,1223.555,1236.468,"We have to vote on this replacement legislation, the legislation that's going to be coming up next that AMENDS the veto for a number of different reasons.",2,,
48,0.97,1236.468,1244.276,"There's the need to make some balancing decisions that are reflected in that bill, and we'll be talking about them later.",2,,
49,0.97,1244.276,1252.784,"So for me, it's really important to highlight the reason why we're taking this vote.",2,,
50,0.97,1252.784,1278.877,"It's not to celebrate the Overwriting of the veto, but it's as a vehicle to get us to the ability to vote on another bill that I'm really hoping accomplishes the shared objectives of the Mayor and Council and members of the public who have worked really hard to not just get the jump start tax measure in place, but also the spending plan.",2,,

56,0.97,1330.762,1361.059,"I agree that all of those logistical hurdles are in front of us, they're real and that this is not an ideal time to be having a conversation overriding a veto that frankly should not have been made in the first place when a different approach in amending, and consulting on these measures before taking that type of an action could have been done.",4,,

61,0.97,1399.765,1418.75,"And that that is spilling over into everything that we're doing as a city government in terms of the atmosphere that has been polarized, and that has been divisive in a way that none of us want to cultivate, and that none of us want to be participating in.",4,,
62,0.97,1418.75,1448.847,"And it is all the more frustrating, given that we're faced with an unprecedented series of challenges this year, from completely Rethinking, and Reinstituting our safety to navigating the bridge, to the waterfront that is falling in Elliott Bay, to the Covid pandemic that is completely engulfing everything, and forcing us to have these meetings on zoom.",4,,

65,0.97,1488.82,1499.164,"And this is not something that I blame any of the different actors in government for, specifically, since the voters have given us divided government.",4,,

77,0.97,1664.329,1685.517,"My understanding is that there could be an opening to work over the next week and a half to nail in this deal, where we would get the money out, we would lock in a commitment to spend the money, and we could all go forward, knowing that it's done and the relief will actually come forward.",4,,
78,0.97,1685.517,1725.356,"And I know that there has been frantic, and frenetic negotiations that have been frustrating over the last 48 hours, where an accord has not been able to be reached, not due to the lack of trying, but any parties on any side of the city government, but I do get the sense that if there is a Sustainment today, that that deal can be locked in, and we can actually get this relief out the door.",4,,
79,0.97,1725.356,1754.652,"Just given that we have had eight months of very polarized back and forth between the executive and the Council, I think that we owe it to the people of Seattle to try for another week and a half and come to an arrangement where the money will get out the door, where we're all locking ourselves into that, and we're all mutually committed to rising to what this occasion requires.",4,,
80,0.97,1754.652,1760.959,And I think that a Sustainment today can help to force that conversation.,4,,

90,0.97,1840.038,1863.494,"So just for the viewing public to provide additional context for why some, at least a couple of us might be struggling with this vote here is that we received a letter with an August revenue, an updated revenue forecast that shows an additional deficit of $50.2 million.",6,,
91,0.97,1863.494,1880.011,"Now they break it out what's the deficit for this year, and what's the deficit for next year, but it's $50 million, $50.2 million, and what we're trying to do is get additional Covid relief out the door that is using our rainy day Fund.",6,,
92,0.97,1880.011,1881.412,So I voted for that measure.,6,,
93,0.97,1881.412,1894.359,"It was unanimous to pass the Covid relief bill of $86 million to drain down the rainy day Fund, leaving only about $13 million left out of $125 million in those funds.",6,,
94,0.97,1894.359,1897.562,But what we now have new information.,6,,
95,0.97,1897.562,1910.341,"This new information is pertinent to the need to Rebalance the budget, and it's a $50 million hole, not a $26 million hole, and the rainy day Fund, once it's gone, it's gone.",6,,
96,0.97,1910.341,1914.245,My concern here is also the trend.,6,,
97,0.97,1914.245,1919.317,"So we're showing a trend, we're showing a trend that's going down.",6,,
98,0.97,1919.317,1922.453,And so we don't know what the bottom is yet.,6,,
99,0.97,1922.453,1936.768,"It's going in the wrong direction, we don't know what the bottom is yet, so I'm concerned about draining down the rainy day fund more at this point except that we still want to get as much Covid relief out the door at the same time.",6,,
100,0.97,1936.768,1950.048,So that's where we get back to this idea of reaching an agreement with the executive to show the public that we can balance the need for compassionate relief with fiscal responsibility.,6,,
101,0.97,1950.048,1958.589,And I know that that's what I hear that's what some of my colleagues have worked to do Úhere.,6,,
102,0.97,1958.589,1970.635,So they've got the bill that's ready to go right after this vote to reduce the Covid relief package by $26 million or so.,6,,
103,0.97,1970.635,1988.419,"My concern is that, you know, we still have this $50 million short fall, and I'm concerned about the city government employees, and the fact that starting January 1, that there may be a challenge, where there need to be layoffs to balance the budget, to Rebalance the budget again.",6,,
104,0.97,1988.419,1994.125,"But we know we have this deficit, so I'm concerned about going as deep into the rainy day Fund.",6,,
105,0.97,1994.125,2004.535,"Yes, we should get more Covid relief out the door, but I also believe yes, we should reach more sustainable agreement with the executive.",6,,

107,0.97,2012.543,2016.748,"My understanding is they've been working really hard on this, and so is the executives.",6,,
108,0.97,2016.748,2023.02,It just seems we need more time here to work out something that's more sustainable.,6,,
109,0.97,2023.02,2035.066,"I may have some additional comments, but I just wanted to highlight that the reason there is this challenge here is the concern over the $50 million hole that we now have as of 48 hours ago.",6,,
110,0.97,2035.066,2038.036,Thank you.,6,,
111,0.97,2038.036,2046.077,"Councilmember Peterson, can you please show me your math on the $50 million?",7,,

113,0.97,2050.014,2055.787,Because the letter that was sent on Monday from Ben noble indicated it was $26.1 million.,7,,
114,0.97,2055.787,2063.361,So I'd like to get a better understanding on the record where your numbers are coming from.,7,,
115,0.97,2063.361,2077.809,"I've also sent a message to Council central staff about this new assertion that I just became aware of, related to this now new position that it's a $50 million deficit for 2020.",7,,
116,0.97,2077.809,2089.153,And I want to make sure that I understand that you're saying that there's now a $50 million deficit for 2020.,7,,
117,0.97,2089.153,2098.729,"Sure, so what I'm saying is that the executive, the updated revenue forecast from the city budget office is at $50.2 million.",8,,
118,0.97,2098.729,2103.0,They're breaking it into two pieces.,8,,
119,0.97,2103.0,2107.171,"$26Million in 2020, and $24.2 million in 2021.",8,,
120,0.97,2107.171,2111.676,My concern is that 2021 is starting on January 1ST.,8,,
121,0.97,2111.676,2131.662,"So we know that this gap exists, and yet we're acting as if we were to pass this, we're acting as if it doesn't exist, so that's my concern is that once January 1 hits, we're into that additional $24.2 million deficit.",8,,
122,0.97,2131.662,2160.191,"I don't think anybody on this Council is acting today in a manner that would imply that we believe there is no deficit for 2021, so I'm going to push back on that assertion that you just made with all due respect, Councilmember Peterson, I think it implies that the folks who might be inclined to overturn the Mayor's veto are somehow doing it in a cavalier fashion without realizing that 2021 does in fact have a deficit.",9,,
123,0.97,2160.191,2165.763,We're all acutely aware of the fact that there will be deficits in 2021.,9,,
124,0.97,2165.763,2195.826,"And so I just want to note that my understanding is that we're also looking at the payroll tax for jump start to pay back some of those identified short falls that you just sighted to currently, and I think the numbers are modest enough to account for higher level of confidence that those revenue numbers will come in, and do the back fill there.",9,,
125,0.97,2195.826,2229.226,"So I just don't want any members of the public who might be viewing this to think that we are somehow ignoring the fiscal realities of either this year or next year by virtue of taking a vote that might be contrary to a Sustainment of the veto, and just want to state that for the record.",9,,
126,0.97,2229.226,2231.095,Did you want to respond?,9,,
127,0.97,2231.095,2234.932,"Yes, Council President.",10,,
128,0.97,2234.932,2244.275,That is an excellent point that the ideas that the rainy day fund would be replenished by the payroll tax revenues.,10,,
129,0.97,2244.275,2262.393,"The challenge of the payroll tax revenues is because the economy is going in the wrong direction that we don't know exactly the dollar amounts that we're going to get to replenish those Fundings, and now we've got a bigger hole than be had thought.",10,,
130,0.97,2262.393,2264.729,So I think it's just the unknowns.,10,,
131,0.97,2264.729,2271.636,There's so many unknowns that I think that's what gives me pause.,10,,
132,0.97,2271.636,2276.34,We don't know the math in the payroll tax in terms of what we're going to collect.,10,,
133,0.97,2276.34,2277.875,I think it's just the unknowns for me.,10,,
134,0.97,2277.875,2283.381,I think it's valid to look at it both ways.,10,,
135,0.97,2283.381,2297.695,I think we're probably going to have a Coronavirus about the validity of those assumptions based on the analysis that we've seen from our own independent Council central staff as opposed to the analysis that we've received from the Mayor office.,11,,
136,0.97,2297.695,2316.48,"I do think that's important to the integrity of our legislative process is to make sure we're also looking at the information that we get from our independent Council central staff, as opposed to the city budget staff, which of course works hand in hand with the Mayor.",11,,
137,0.97,2316.48,2323.821,"Folks, let's go ahead and, I'm going to open it up to other folks.",11,,
138,0.97,2323.821,2331.629,I know Councilmember Herbold is in the Queue.,11,,
139,0.97,2331.629,2341.372,It's hard to figure out how to jump on folks.,11,,
140,0.97,2341.372,2345.743,Hopefully Councilmember Skada you've jotted notes.,11,,
141,0.97,2345.743,2352.049,"I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to speak for a second time, even though others haven't spoke yet.",12,,
142,0.97,2352.049,2385.015,"I forgot to mention in my earlier comments, because I was saving them for the discussion of the next bill, but when Councilmember Lewis spoke it occurred to me that I really should have, I should have included the comments about the language in the second bill to address the concerns about wherever folks have whether or not to vote for the current override of the veto, or vote to sustain the veto.",12,,
143,0.97,2385.015,2419.917,"In acknowledgement of the uncertainty that Councilmember Peterson mentioned, about future revenue updates in concerns that I have expressed, and the Mayor's office has expressed, also about the ability to get the money out the door, and to the concerns that Councilmember Lewis has expressed about the fact that perhaps with more time we would be able to have more unanimity.",12,,
144,0.97,2419.917,2462.393,"I really feel the language that we are proposing in the new section 3 of the amended bill, the amended jump start bill really recognizes that we are close in getting to a place of agreement on these principles, but we're not there yet, given that we're not there yet, given that we've had a Council resource, and given that we have a staff working on the executive side of things, particularly in the budget office staff that are working on the Council side of things, we wanted to give some flexibility to the executive in recognition that we're close on agreement, but we may still have some details to work out.",12,,
145,0.97,2462.393,2476.373,"So the language States that the Council acknowledges that the administration of the program will require new contracts, and systems to distribute these critical services in direct relief to the community.",12,,
146,0.97,2476.373,2483.514,"And that this may take time, and could result in not Expending the full $57 million in 2020.",12,,
147,0.97,2483.514,2502.399,"If the full amount is not expended in 2020, the Council is committed to working with the executive to continue funding these critical Covid-19 relief programs in 2021, and to address newly identified 2020 revenue short falls.",12,,
148,0.97,2502.399,2531.896,"So in essence, with this new section, we're saying, if there are logistical reasons for not being able to get all the money out the door in 2020, or if there are, we're going to get another revenue update, I think sometime in November, if we get additional bad news, we will work with the executive to allow them to spend less than the $57 million that is in this bill.",12,,
149,0.97,2531.896,2542.773,"And that is my commitment to the executive, and with the passage of this legislation, it would be the Council's commitment to the executive.",12,,

154,0.97,2570.067,2570.801,One bill implemented the tax.,14,,
155,0.97,2570.801,2589.787,"One bill gave a plan for how the funds would be invested, and the last year used the rainy day, and emergency reserves as a temporary loan to make some of the 2021 funds from Amazon be available right away for urgent Covid needs.",14,,
156,0.97,2589.787,2594.258,That last bill is what the Mayor has vetoed.,14,,
157,0.97,2594.258,2607.104,"In our Email, Mayor Durkan said, and I quote it is irresponsible to spend our rainy day funds in the beginning of what is likely a multiyear approach.",14,,
158,0.97,2607.104,2609.306,Let us consider if this is true.,14,,
159,0.97,2609.306,2635.733,"It would be naive to think the impacts of the Covid emergency would not stretch at least into next year, if not longer, but the reality is, Mayor Durkan is convinced she will need the rainy day funds next year only because she has been from the beginning, totally opposed to taxing big business in any form, especially corporations which have paid for her ancillary eye election campaign.",14,,
160,0.97,2635.733,2646.043,"If you are willing to tax Amazon and other corporations, then there is a clear view to budget cuts.",14,,
161,0.97,2646.043,2648.679,Amazon made $5 million of profits in the second quarter of 2020.,14,,
162,0.97,2648.679,2652.75,"Double of what they made last year, and that's their profits after expenses.",14,,
163,0.97,2652.75,2660.057,They can afford to pay a slightly higher tax rate than the small tax on big businesses that has been passed already.,14,,
164,0.97,2660.057,2667.798,"I fully support this bill to overturn the Mayor's veto, because we need Covid relief funds to our community now.",14,,
165,0.97,2667.798,2674.905,"However the explicit, and continued threat of draconian budget cuts in 2021 must also be taken seriously.",14,,
166,0.97,2674.905,2682.079,"Today, several Councilmembers have already spoken as if they accept as established fact there will be Furloughs and layoffs next year.",14,,
167,0.97,2682.079,2701.432,"I want to state for the record, I absolutely do not accept Furloughs or layoffs, because they are not necessary if the political establishment had the political will to tax big business in order to make austerity completely unnecessary.",14,,
168,0.97,2701.432,2704.334,It is because politicians choose austerity that those layoffs become necessary.,14,,
169,0.97,2704.334,2706.737,It's not an act of God.,14,,
170,0.97,2706.737,2709.006,It is a choice made by politicians.,14,,
171,0.97,2709.006,2721.652,"Remember that when the Council was voting on the budget, and also on the Amazon tax itself, my office proposed increasing the rate of the Amazon tax to collect an additional $293 million per year.",14,,
172,0.97,2721.652,2732.863,"Money . Unds like a lot of but as you look at the tax rate increase for big corporations that are going to pay the tax, it is a very, very small change.",14,,
173,0.97,2732.863,2748.445,"That would have eliminated all of the then projected budget short falls of 2021, and I have no doubt that the math works out for the biggest corporations to be taxed a little bit more so that we avoid austerity entirely.",14,,
174,0.97,2748.445,2770.267,"I support using the rainy day funds today to meet the burning needs of regular working class people this year, and I also think it is essential that the Council increased the rate of the Amazon tax for the budget cuts that the Mayor is threatening next year, because otherwise, austerity will be a given.",14,,
175,0.97,2770.267,2772.169,Covid-19 is a health emergency caused by a virus.,14,,
176,0.97,2772.169,2786.683,"But the public health damage it is causing is rooted in the deep inequality in American capitalism, and especially Exacerbatedly the lack of coverage to basic Healthcare and by the horrific response by the Trump administration.",14,,
177,0.97,2786.683,2791.054,The economic recession is not simply a product of the pandemic.,14,,
178,0.97,2791.054,2798.629,It is the fundamental crisis of the capital system.,14,,
179,0.97,2798.629,2813.343,"Every time there is an economic recession, there's a struggle over which class will pay for this crisis, the working class or the ruling class.",14,,
180,0.97,2813.343,2820.284,"In 2008, especially black and Latino families were bailed out, while working class homeowners lost everything.",14,,
181,0.97,2820.284,2839.97,"In 2021, either Amazon and other big businesses will pay a small portion of their immense wealth they have accumulated by exploiting workers in our community, or public sector employees will pay through mandatory Furloughs and lost incomes and cuts to social services.",14,,
182,0.97,2839.97,2851.615,"Who will pay will be determined by the balance of forces and whether or not there will be mass movements on the streets, and in particular, led by labor unions.",14,,
183,0.97,2851.615,2853.483,"Big business, not workers pay for this crisis.",14,,
184,0.97,2853.483,2857.988,Thank you.,14,,
185,0.97,2857.988,2864.461,Thank you Councilmember Sawan Sawant.,15,,
186,0.97,2864.461,2864.962,Councilmember Mosqueda.,15,,
187,0.97,2864.962,2867.064,"Thank you very much, Madam President.",16,,
188,0.97,2867.064,2873.57,There's just a few items I felt like needed clarification.,16,,
189,0.97,2873.57,2877.007,"Number one, this is a 2020 spend plan.",16,,
190,0.97,2877.007,2882.012,This is providing immediate Covid relief in 2020.,16,,
191,0.97,2882.012,2886.516,"So let's not Conflate the numbers of 26 million, and 24 million for next year.",16,,
192,0.97,2886.516,2894.358,"This has always been about 2020, and the immediate relief that we need to get out the door right now.",16,,
193,0.97,2894.358,2894.858,Our numbers are clear.,16,,
194,0.97,2894.858,2909.306,"We identify 26 million in conversation with director Ben noble immediately on Monday, and have been working diligently to try to reduce the amount of funding that goes out by that $26 million number.",16,,
195,0.97,2909.306,2919.483,"But if you want to talk about 2021, the 2021 plan for the jump start revenue package was to invest in city services.",16,,
196,0.97,2919.483,2930.46,"Was to prevent Furloughs, and to prevent layoffs, and to really shore up core government services, like parks and libraries, and Childcare.",16,,
197,0.97,2930.46,2935.632,What is critical is that we recognize that these two issues cannot be pitted against each other.,16,,
198,0.97,2935.632,2955.686,"So in effect, the two part process that we have in front of us, basically acknowledges that we are front loading 26 million into this critical service of shoring up key government priorities and public employees by offering 26 million to be used for that in this year.",16,,
199,0.97,2955.686,2966.897,"It then continues to allocate the remaining amount, or as Councilmember Herbold articulated, the amount that is possible to get out the door this year for the 2020 allocations.",16,,
200,0.97,2966.897,2973.704,"But something else though is missing from the conversation over the last few weeks, but especially right now is that the dollars get replenished.",16,,
201,0.97,2973.704,2976.473,So I want to be very clear.,16,,
202,0.97,2976.473,2982.913,"Yes, there's a lot of uncertainty in our local economy and the economy around the globe.",16,,
203,0.97,2982.913,2990.821,But what is certain is that we will be able to replenish the reserves that we are borrowing right now for this crisis.,16,,
204,0.97,2990.821,2994.791,This is the rainy day.,16,,
205,0.97,2994.791,2995.492,This is the emergency.,16,,
206,0.97,2995.492,2996.827,Compounding public health crisis and housing emergency.,16,,
207,0.97,2996.827,2999.863,This is the time for us to use those dollars.,16,,
208,0.97,2999.863,3023.253,"And it is very important that we're clear with the public that we know exactly how we will replenish these funds, because jump start progressive revenue, the payroll tax proposal, and a conservative estimate is assuming $214 million a year, when we start collecting those taxes based on the 2021 payroll tax roll.",16,,
209,0.97,3023.253,3026.656,So let me just pause at this.,16,,
210,0.97,3026.656,3056.987,"Even though there is uncertainty in how fast the economy will recover and we're in this position because we have a U per recovery ahead of us, if we had gotten every single $86 million out the door this year, we would have been able to replenish those dollars next year with jump start funding, because $86 million is 40% of the overall total we're expected to be bringing in.",16,,
211,0.97,3056.987,3065.195,"Even if we were wrong by 60%, we would be able to replenish the jump start payroll, using the payroll tax with next year's payroll tax dollars.",16,,
212,0.97,3065.195,3070.801,So then let's look at the dollar amount in front of us.,16,,
213,0.97,3070.801,3073.537,We're talking about up to $57 million.,16,,
214,0.97,3073.537,3098.695,"We would have to be wildly off, which I know that our central staff, and our folks that we've been working with, both at the national level and locally here when crafting jump start proposal, we have a carefully Crafted proposal in front of us, that we're just using a portion of the dollars right now, with a certainty that we will be able to replenish the dollars that get out, once we begin to collect the payroll tax.",16,,
215,0.97,3098.695,3107.771,"It's really important that the public recognize that the jump start payroll tax Replenishes the emergency Fund, and any rainy day fund that we would use.",16,,
216,0.97,3107.771,3111.741,"But at this point, we're just talking about $57 million.",16,,
217,0.97,3111.741,3121.117,"So the argument that the city needs to save additional emergency funds for city workers or city services, let me be really clear.",16,,
218,0.97,3121.117,3143.306,"The coalition for city unions has supported the jump start payroll tax and is supportive of this effort to get dollars out the door immediately to those in need for housing and food assistance, as well as to be able to use $26 million to help prevent the types of core government services that we rely on every day from shutting down.",16,,
219,0.97,3143.306,3150.514,They have been supportive as folks that provide Daly city services with the proposal in front of us.,16,,
220,0.97,3150.514,3164.361,"This bill ultimately helps prevent more people from being laid off in the future if we can really invest now, and start bringing in jump start payroll taxes to replenish in the upcoming years.",16,,
221,0.97,3164.361,3169.366,"There's not a lot of unknowns, actually, when you look at what our proposal includes.",16,,
222,0.97,3169.366,3186.216,"Because on a very conservative estimate, we will be Replenishing these funds, especially if we're talking about the existing funding for 2020, we have a certainty that we will be able to pay that back with jump start progressive revenue.",16,,
223,0.97,3186.216,3187.117,I do have a chart.,16,,
224,0.97,3187.117,3191.421,I could show you that just to illustrate the point.,16,,
225,0.97,3191.421,3200.13,"But while the unknowns were mentioned, let me just remind folks of the Knowns.",16,,
226,0.97,3200.13,3207.437,"Week, that there are more Ast people paying their rent this week using a credit card than unemployment checks.",16,,
227,0.97,3207.437,3210.34,We know that Childcares will close down.,16,,
228,0.97,3210.34,3215.245,Around 30% of Childcares are slated to close down unless they get immediate assistance.,16,,
229,0.97,3215.245,3222.986,And we know that many of the small businesses that are poised to close without additional local flexible dollars will not be able to reopen due to the start up costs.,16,,
230,0.97,3222.986,3225.755,Those are the Knowns in front of us.,16,,
231,0.97,3225.755,3243.006,"So I just wanted to correct the record, Madam President about the Knowns and the unknowns, because the dollars in the Reserve funds are going to be paid back, using 2,021-Dollars and that is just around the corner.",16,,
232,0.97,3243.006,3262.792,"This is the emergency and again I do want to thank the Ceo so we could collectively work in the process, I hope we get to the second bill here because it does provide a path forward.",16,,
233,0.97,3277.374,3287.717,"Obviously, no one speaks on",16,,
234,0.97,3287.717,3292.322,Critical city services and care for our most venerable.,17,,
235,0.97,3292.322,3300.297,"Thank you, Councilman Mosqueda.",18,,
236,0.97,3300.297,3304.534,Are there any other comments on the reconsideration of counsel bill 119812?,18,,
237,0.97,3304.534,3308.438,"Councilman Pedersen, please.",18,,
238,0.97,3308.438,3312.242,Thank you I appreciate everyone's comments.,19,,
239,0.97,3312.242,3315.111,I know there is a lot of pieces of information.,19,,
240,0.97,3315.111,3321.418,I think everyone is Well- intentioned to get Covid-19 out the door.,19,,
241,0.97,3321.418,3341.971,"I think all of the intentions are good, I am approaching from a different angle here in terms of the revenue forecast . I guess I just had additional context to my original comments what we are focused on the people tracks Replenishing the rainy day Fund.",19,,
242,0.97,3341.971,3353.75,"I think what the challenges as we know, we get our city revenue from sources, Ian owe taxes, property taxes, sales taxes and the trend is bad and negative.",19,,
243,0.97,3353.75,3357.187,The rainy day funds are one- time funds.,19,,
244,0.97,3357.187,3385.582,"I just wanted to paint a picture and if for whatever reason the veto is sustained today, I commit myself to work with all parties to get something done in the next few days so it is getting people more time to craft a more sustainable compromise so that the executive has real dollars out the door quickly that the Mayor is committed to getting those out the door.",19,,
245,0.97,3385.582,3389.018,Sounds like there needs to be a few more days to work that out.,19,,
246,0.97,3389.018,3396.926,And make it to join with folks to get that done.,19,,
247,0.97,3396.926,3404.834,Are there any other questions or comments on counsel bill 119812?,20,,
248,0.97,3404.834,3413.443,"Did you want to make closing remarks, Councilman Mosqueda?",20,,
249,0.97,3413.443,3417.046,"I will make some comments before that, I was seeing if anybody else wanted to offer thoughts.",20,,
250,0.97,3417.046,3418.248,"Okay, I see none.",21,,
251,0.97,3418.248,3434.931,I will add to the debate and the record here before handing it over to Councilman Mosqueda to close out the debate on reconsideration the counsel bill 119812.,21,,
252,0.97,3434.931,3450.18,I just want to start by acknowledging that I recognize our economic picture is unstable currently due to Covid- 19 and the related economic crisis.,21,,
253,0.97,3450.18,3472.302,"And yes, there are some unknown factors and that is inherent in the reality that we continue to appreciate and understand the depth of the economic crisis and the recovery period that will be necessary to come out of this.",21,,
254,0.97,3472.302,3486.983,I really sit with a fact that knowing those things does not give me a reason to or an excuse to shock me into inaction.,21,,
255,0.97,3486.983,3504.634,These are uncertain times but I think our constituents are looking to us to take action in this period of time that is reasonable and that is rooted and acknowledgment of new information that we recently received.,21,,
256,0.97,3504.634,3515.845,"I want to encourage us to yes, acknowledge that there are uncertainties but these uncertainties cannot shock us into inaction.",21,,
257,0.97,3515.845,3531.027,We cannot just freeze ourselves in amber and wait for all of the factors that we think do not have questions or answers to them before we take action.,21,,
258,0.97,3531.027,3555.785,"Now, I believe that Mayor Durkan and most of this counsel share the values of balancing budget, of appreciating the volatility of our economic forecast and appreciating the depth and the breath of the need of our constituents who are suffering during this economic crisis.",21,,
259,0.97,3555.785,3575.872,"And, I do believe that that is where the common ground is where we are, unfortunately, not able to find consensus today is on this issue of what the number should be for the spending plan.",21,,
260,0.97,3575.872,3600.096,"I will disclose to you colleagues that I have spent the last couple of days having very long conversations with the Mayor directly, with senior deputy Mayor and my staff has also been engaging with the staff from the Mayor's office.",21,,
261,0.97,3600.096,3616.913,"I, unfortunately, we were not able to come up with an agreement in large part because there was insistence on there being a Sustainment of the veto before we can agree to a number.",21,,
262,0.97,3616.913,3652.882,"I believe that we need to have this vote on reconsideration because the Charter requires us to do it and there was an opportunity that Unfortunately, we were unable to achieve agreement to but there would have been an opportunity to Memorialize a compromise and agreement between us and the executive on the quality aspects of the Jumpstart Covid- 19 release pending bill but Unfortunately, we cannot get there.",21,,
263,0.97,3652.882,3701.431,"Now, I think that Unfortunately, I'm not sure that three or four days will yield or produce a deal but I do think that those conversations are still important to have . So, I do intend to vote in favor of an override but I will do that in the spirit of putting forth a bill that represents the councils compromise position as a place for us to have conversations with the executive, that would address her particular concerns.",21,,
264,0.97,3701.431,3711.207,"I think we can both override this veto, we can amend counsel bill 119812 in the fashion that we have been describing.",21,,
265,0.97,3711.207,3728.658,"And, we can still have conversations with the Mayor and her staff around additional amendments that might be needed to the bill based on information I understand the executive is continuing together.",21,,
266,0.97,3728.658,3730.927,I believe that's a reasonable position.,21,,
267,0.97,3730.927,3762.792,"It's a responsible path forward . I think we have, again, done all that we can do in the last 48 hours to identify that path and to do it in a way that is collaborative and that will allow us all to feel good about this ultimately and to achieve the ultimate goal which is to get these dollars into a community.",21,,
268,0.97,3762.792,3785.014,The and friends and the implication by some of you colleagues that somehow have been creating some sort of intentional tension or have inherently been the problem or the holdup in terms of the negotiations is not accurate.,21,,
269,0.97,3785.014,3811.507,"I have spent hours on the phone over the last 48 hours trying everything I can to find and close the daylight and find the common ground in hopes that we could both do an override, quickly Memorialize that agreement in a mandatory language and move on with getting these dollars out to communities.",21,,
270,0.97,3811.507,3822.151,"Unfortunately, it was made very clear to me that an agreement could not and would not be reached without first agreeing to sustaining the Mayor's veto.",21,,
271,0.97,3822.151,3838.134,"That is not something that I feel is Procedurally appropriate for us, too, if we want to effectuate the underlying $57 million amendment today.",21,,
272,0.97,3838.134,3865.595,"I feel strongly time is of the essence and I would really like to wrap this up today for purposes of being able to get the Department and the agencies responsible as much time as possible to begin the process of pushing these dollars out which, at this point, I understand would occur early September if we take action now.",21,,
273,0.97,3865.595,3963.659,"So, I just wanted to share the information with all of you because there have been some comments implying that we somehow have not tried hard enough or that somehow, we have presented a roadblock in terms of the efforts that Councilman Mosqueda and Councilman Herbold and I have undertaken but I feel like we have really tried hard to come with a consensus and that being said, I still want to leave the door open to conversations even after today to further address some in any additional concerns that might come out of the analysis that might continue to be done by the city budget office and as they continue to receive additional information about the economic forecast that might be relative to this particular question but I feel we have addressed the substance of policy issues both through the reduction from $83 Million- $57 million and also incorporating the language which does not mandate that the Mayor has to spend $57 million but simply authorizes her to do so if, based on all the information available to her, feels that she has the basis to do so with the understanding that if she does not, we will all come back together to identify how to use those dollars.",21,,
274,0.97,3963.659,3980.976,"That is why I am supporting this and would encourage my other colleagues to also support an override of this veto so that we can move along to the second substance of the bill pay expect all right Councilman Mosqueda, you got the last word.",21,,
275,0.97,3980.976,3985.014,"Thank you, Council President.",22,,
276,0.97,3985.014,3986.015,I want to echo your comments.,22,,
277,0.97,3986.015,3988.718,I appreciate the way you placed this.,22,,
278,0.97,3988.718,3998.828,The way in which we try to adjust the count concerns brought up by the Ceo and adjust the change in number of 26 million now is include in here.,22,,
279,0.97,3998.828,4002.798,I wanted to lift up the comments that Councilman Pedersen made about the good intentions.,22,,
280,0.97,4002.798,4012.842,"I appreciate you mentioning that and within counsel, among counsel and with our partnership with the executive and Ceo.",22,,
281,0.97,4012.842,4026.222,That is where I started my comments this morning and that is where I wanted to end with the good intentions of not just to address the needs of city services but the deep need within our residents.,22,,
282,0.97,4026.222,4028.457,These two issues are not in conflict.,22,,
283,0.97,4028.457,4036.198,"It is the one, two step approach we have with this bill and the next bill help address these two areas are absolutely needing to go parallel together.",22,,
284,0.97,4036.198,4042.338,We must be able to provide for city services in order to care.,22,,
285,0.97,4042.338,4057.353,We must be getting the dollars as we identify from Covid-19 emergency relief Jumpstart bill out into communities so people can keep their house and half and keep their small business and make sure the Kiddos have a place to go for child care to keep people from needing the services.,22,,
286,0.97,4057.353,4058.788,These two go Hand-In-Hand.,22,,
287,0.97,4058.788,4072.501,"I look forward working with you all, making sure the conversations continue with the Mayor's office in terms of how we allocate those dollars and get them out the door.",22,,
288,0.97,4072.501,4081.277,I appreciate Councilman Herbold on the hard work to make sure this revenue is a moving target and we want to be responsive to that but we must be responsive to the urgent needs.,22,,
289,0.97,4081.277,4108.704,"I will close with saying we received over 500 Emails . We have received letters that include over 70 organizations on them, thousands of calls, 800 people individually signed up to the petition in addition to the three letters I sent you all today urging our action today and doing so, I think helps us get to the next step and investing in our community and provide protection to our city.",22,,
290,0.97,4108.704,4110.94,Let's do this.,22,,
291,0.97,4110.94,4116.445,"Thank you, Councilman Mosqueda.",23,,
292,0.97,4116.445,4118.647,We will close the debate and called this to vote.,23,,
293,0.97,4118.647,4143.873,"Before we do that, I want to make sure that I provide an opportunity to our counsel central staff to remind us as to what the parameters are related to the number of votes necessary for either an override or Sustainment to occur.",23,,
294,0.97,4143.873,4152.448,"I will call on Allie or Dan, whoever is prepared to speak do that.",23,,
295,0.97,4152.448,4162.491,"I believe I think I need to, Martin clerk, do I need to suspend the rules in order to allow counsel central staff to speak to us?",23,,
296,0.97,4162.491,4167.463,That is a practice relying --,24,,
297,0.97,4167.463,4183.112,"Okay is there is no objection, I would ask that we suspend the rules to allow counsel central staff to address the city council on this matter . hearing no objection, thank you for that.",25,,
298,0.97,4183.112,4196.892,I think that's important for us to make the public record and to make sure all Councilmembers are aware of the procedural requirements before we call the roll on the reconsideration of passage of counsel bill 119812.,25,,
299,0.97,4196.892,4203.032,I will hand it to Dan and Aly.,25,,
300,0.97,4203.032,4248.043,"Thank you identity of the central staff, I believe the question is what is the threshold and effect for the consideration of the veto, counsel bill 119812 . My understanding after consulting with various folks in the law Department and clerk's office is that the city charter and the Council will provide a veto over I consideration requires six of the nine Councilmembers to vote in the affirmative for the veto override on the packet.",26,,
301,0.97,4248.043,4254.35,I can answer any further questions that may be available.,26,,
302,0.97,4254.35,4256.252,Looks like we have one question.,27,,
303,0.97,4256.252,4258.654,"Councilman Pedersen, please.",27,,
304,0.97,4258.654,4261.29,Can you repeat the number?,28,,
305,0.97,4261.29,4273.869,"Yes, the number is six votes of the full Council to override a veto.",29,,
306,0.97,4273.869,4278.307,Did you get that information from the city attorney's office?,30,,
307,0.97,4278.307,4278.774,Yes.,31,,
308,0.97,4278.774,4285.681,"Colleagues, I think that language comes directly from the city Charter as well.",32,,
309,0.97,4285.681,4307.536,"If you look at section 12 of the city Charter, it does read the Council shall not less than five days of publication and within 30 days after such about reconsider and vote upon the same and if the same shall oppose reconsideration, passed by the affirmative vote of not less than two thirds of all the members.",32,,
310,0.97,4307.536,4316.211,"The President of the Council shall certify a fight on the bill and when so certified, the bill should become an ordinance with like effect as if it has not Beendisapproved by the Mayor.",32,,
311,0.97,4316.211,4333.862,"So, the city charter in section 12 does explicitly cite that an override is effectuated by a two thirds vote of the members of the Council which in this case, would be six . Councilman Pedersen and then Councilman Herbold.",32,,
312,0.97,4333.862,4345.007,Thank you . What's interesting about this particular bill was that it was an appropriations bill which requires seven affirmative votes.,33,,
313,0.97,4345.007,4352.648,"As I understand it, the Mayor's veto then canceled the law and the only way to resurrect that law is to have separate votes.",33,,
314,0.97,4352.648,4358.887,I was hoping Maybe the city clerk can also Chime in on this.,33,,
315,0.97,4358.887,4383.512,"We have some legal analysis on that as well, Dan, or Allie, would you like to walk us through what occurs when there is both an override of a veto and appropriations bill that requires three quarters of a vote on the appropriations aspect of this legislation?",34,,
316,0.97,4383.512,4384.38,"Yes, of course.",35,,
317,0.97,4384.38,4474.77,"There is some additional advice as Councilman Pedersen was alluding to I believe or is asking about at any rate, when the state law requires a Three- quarter vote for midyear emergency appropriations and that is what this bill, 119812, entailed, there is some question about whether the detailed override vote, if it is six votes versus a seven vote Three-Quarter Supermajority or two thirds Supermajority, whether the appropriations that are in the underlying bill become effective . that question would get cured whether they become effective or not effective, there are other provisions within the 119812 that appropriations and with two thirds Supermajority become effective . The appropriations, if they are not effective, would become effective in the next bill that you were considering . I believe that is one 19860, if there is a Three- quarter Supermajority vote to approve the appropriations in that separate bill.",35,,
318,0.97,4474.77,4518.747,"Thanks . I would add to that, if the veto override happens with a two thirds majority, I will send a slightly modified version of the substitute that makes the same changes that were proposed in the substitute version distributed this morning but I addressed those effectuate those changes in a technically different manner assuming that the appropriations sections that Dan just described would not be in effect effort to veto Overrides, we incorporate a entirely new appropriations section and a new section.",36,,
319,0.97,4518.747,4523.952,"Thank you, Dan and Aly.",37,,
320,0.97,4523.952,4552.381,"Aly, just to follow up on your point, effectively, the technical revision that you would send out, depending on the roll call results here, would effectively be in amendment to the appropriations of counsel bill 119812 if the veto is overridden?",37,,
321,0.97,4552.381,4568.964,"Right, with the veto override, sections 2 and four and counsel bill 119812 would not be basically part of counsel bill 119812 anymore after the override.",38,,
322,0.97,4568.964,4571.266,"So, you would be amending the bill to Reinsert them.",38,,
323,0.97,4571.266,4596.224,It will appear that the appropriations table that is currently in section 2 of 119812 is going higher than a new appropriations table that is just spending $57 million to be incorporated versus what I distributed this morning that is striking out individual numbers and amending them with new numbers.,38,,
324,0.97,4596.224,4602.431,It's effectively the same result at the end of the day but it is a technically different mechanism to get there.,38,,
325,0.97,4602.431,4607.135,"Thank you, Aly.",39,,
326,0.97,4607.135,4608.604,"Councilman Herbold, you have your hand raised.",39,,
327,0.97,4608.604,4610.739,"My question has been answered, thank you.",40,,
328,0.97,4610.739,4622.751,"Colleagues, any other questions for Aly or Dan from our counsel central staff?",41,,
329,0.97,4622.751,4623.418,Okay.,41,,
330,0.97,4623.418,4623.852,Hearing none.,41,,
331,0.97,4623.852,4628.156,Thank you Dan and Aly for providing us with that additional clarification.,41,,
332,0.97,4628.156,4637.466,I know you were all working today on identifying answers to those procedural questions.,41,,
333,0.97,4637.466,4643.872,"I appreciate that . Okay, there are no other comments, I will close that debate.",41,,
334,0.97,4643.872,4654.349,The city council will now vote to reconsider passage of counsel bill 119812 . to either Overwrite or sustain the mayoral veto.,41,,
335,0.97,4654.349,4670.098,"During moral called, Councilmembers will either vote I to override the Mayor's veto or vote no to sustain the veto.",41,,
336,0.97,4670.098,4689.818,"If the vote on the motion is tight or if it is less than two thirds, in other words six votes, then the bill fails and the veto is sustained . are there any questions on the vote?",41,,
337,0.97,4689.818,4693.689,"All right, last time we did this, it got a little confusing.",41,,
338,0.97,4693.689,4696.191,People were confused on what yes meant or what no meant.,41,,
339,0.97,4696.191,4705.934,"I want to make clear if you vote yes, it is to cancel the veto, if you vote no, it's to keep the veto in place.",41,,
340,0.97,4705.934,4706.735,Does that make sense?,41,,
341,0.97,4706.735,4709.337,Everybody is clear?,41,,

386,0.97,4948.276,4962.857,It reduces the total amount of spending in the bill from $83 million to $57 million and as language recognizing it may take time to get the funding out of the door in 2020.,72,,
387,0.97,4962.857,4976.304,"If it is not expended, the counselor will work with the executive to extend the funding into 2021 for the is Covid-19 relief programs and work with the executives to address any additional 2020 revenue issues.",72,,
388,0.97,4976.304,4990.085,"I will NOTE this version that was originally distributed, the difference is it fully strikes what section 2 and four in the original Covid-19 relief bill and adds an new appropriations for a total of 57 million dollars.",72,,
389,0.97,4990.085,5037.832,"I would also add that for example, the executive determined the additional spending is needed from the revenue stabilization account or emergency Fund, this action will be about $9.9 million in the emergency Fund and 28.7 million in the revenue stabilization account . The Mayor will have to come to the counsel and request authority to spend those dollars . At that time, if there was an additional revenue issue that was identified by the Council and the Mayor, you can also introduce legislation to further amend the Covid-19 relief spending additional resources that were needed for any other purposes.",72,,
390,0.97,5037.832,5054.682,"I will send, I will note the numbers in the stabilization account also assume package of Council bill 119862 that is later, but if they million dollars for the research.",72,,

393,0.97,5063.591,5066.661,Okay.,73,,
394,0.97,5066.661,5067.162,Hearing no questions.,73,,
395,0.97,5067.162,5076.471,We will now open it up for comments and debate.,73,,
396,0.97,5076.471,5080.008,I will actually go back to Councilman Mosqueda.,73,,
397,0.97,5080.008,5083.411,"I think you wanted to have Aly speak before you, the floor is yours.",73,,
398,0.97,5083.411,5087.816,"Thank you, Madam President.",74,,
399,0.97,5087.816,5096.925,I think of a piece of legislation in front of us now is reflective of the reality that we are faced with.,74,,
400,0.97,5096.925,5113.341,"This is an ongoing crisis that requires us to both invest in community needs in terms of housing Childcare, food assistance, and small business support and recognizing the change in nature in which our city government is trying to respond to the need to provide public health assistance and financial assistance to folks in our community.",74,,
401,0.97,5113.341,5135.13,I think of the carefully proposal in front of you is an offer and Jester to work to address both the crisis presenting itself in terms of financing but act quickly and invest in with our community and families and seniors need.,74,,
402,0.97,5135.13,5152.38,"When we do, data shows repeatedly that that type of investment into community helps makes the recovery happen faster . What we have put in front of us is an equitable way to sustain this crisis as we weather the storm that Covid-19 is creating.",74,,
403,0.97,5152.38,5169.797,I want to appreciate the ongoing work in front of us to work with the Mayor's office and all of our colleagues to get the money out the door in a way that is received by community but reflective of the changing nature of our climate and we will be looking forward to working with the Ceo and Mayor's office on that.,74,,
404,0.97,5169.797,5192.82,This piece of legislation is really important and it includes funding for communities like research budgeting process which I know Councilman Morales has been helping to provide and meet to the bone in terms of what we are doing with community organizations as we think about a community which is a anticipatory letter process.,74,,
405,0.97,5192.82,5216.144,We are excited about the ongoing support provided to Covid-19 relief just to reiterate the importance of making sure that we are investing and where Covid-19 really funding went goes hand in the conversations we have been having over the last two months as well.,74,,
406,0.97,5216.144,5228.523,"Those who have been hit the hardest because of Covid-19 are black and Brown communities, folks are more likely to work in the service sector and low weight industries are black and Brown workers.",74,,
407,0.97,5228.523,5236.931,Those who are more likely to have housing instability and food instability and lack of access to affordable Childcare our members from our black and Brown community.,74,,
408,0.97,5236.931,5253.181,"This is really an opportunity for us to use a racial justice analysis, help get dollars out the door and recognize our core government services, which were holding back money to invest in for city employees and city services, provide direct relief as well.",74,,
409,0.97,5253.181,5254.382,This is a well-balanced package.,74,,
410,0.97,5254.382,5260.888,"With that, I know there was a number of Councilmembers who provided key elements to this amended version in front of us.",74,,
411,0.97,5260.888,5266.094,I will turn it back to you to have other comments on this.,74,,
412,0.97,5266.094,5268.796,Thank you so much Councilman Mosqueda.,75,,
413,0.97,5268.796,5270.398,Are there any other comments on the bill?,75,,
414,0.97,5270.398,5275.303,"Councilman Herbold, Councilmember Lewis and Councilman Morales.",75,,
415,0.97,5275.303,5307.201,Thank you I'm anticipating with some of the conversations about our vote today might sound like coming out of this about and anticipating sort of what the narrative might be and wanting to provide some context and some prognostication about what the appropriate answers might be to some of those issues.,76,,
416,0.97,5307.201,5316.577,I would not be surprised if we hear from the executive that 57 million to be spent in 2020 is too much.,76,,
417,0.97,5316.577,5337.231,I want to be clear that what we are saying with this amended language is this is appropriation authority and we acknowledge the executive may not be able to get the money out in 2020 or it may not be the right thing to do to get the money out in 2020.,76,,
418,0.97,5337.231,5359.187,"If, in November, we get another revenue update that shows additional reductions in revenue, some of these dollars may need to be transferred over to our emergency fund or other things that our emergency fund would otherwise pay for.",76,,
419,0.97,5359.187,5385.98,"So, just trying to anticipate a narrative that we did not bring the number down to a small enough number to be financially responsible, I'm saying the flexibility that we built into this legislation allows the branch of government that spends the money to consider the restraints on spending the money.",76,,
420,0.97,5385.98,5411.439,"I have been, up to these last few minutes, having discussions with the CBO in the middle of this meeting about a different number, something other than $57 million, something lower that they would feel more comfortable with and thank you, Aly, she was preparing to offer an alternative.",76,,
421,0.97,5411.439,5434.762,"I'm not bringing forward the alternative because the message I'm still getting from the executive is that before there is agreement on what this spending plan should aim to spend, that they really wanted the Council to sustain the veto.",76,,
422,0.97,5434.762,5465.593,"So, that was not the direction that this Council is going in because we have a bill that relies on amending a veto that has been overturned and because of the other items that I mentioned earlier and other Councilmembers have as well about the short amount of time that we have before recess and the one number of hours the staff have been working.",76,,
423,0.97,5465.593,5465.893,Thank you.,76,,
424,0.97,5465.893,5467.795,"Thank you, Councilman Herbold.",77,,
425,0.97,5467.795,5472.7,Councilmember Lewis and put yourself on you.,77,,
426,0.97,5472.7,5475.369,"Thank you, Madam President.",78,,
427,0.97,5475.369,5485.112,My comments are fairly similar to Councilman Herbold . I am thrilled to vote for this new bill today.,78,,
428,0.97,5485.112,5506.534,I want to thank Councilman Mosqueda for bringing this forward to Cue this up . I guess I would sort of Rhetorically pose my comments to the executive in discussing this to say all of us share the common interests of getting relief to the people in Seattle that really need this assistance.,78,,
429,0.97,5506.534,5512.54,I know that they are going to be issues around concerns about what the number is.,78,,
430,0.97,5512.54,5552.179,"I guess I would just and poor in the spirit of us all moving together that in sending this new bill to the executive for consideration, we keep that dialogue open that if there are concerns, that that be addressed in reaching out to us to be able to pursue some of the potential legislators collaborate and be able to discuss how we can work together to build the changes necessary to make sure considerations of the condition of the city and people who cannot pay rent can pay the rent.",78,,
431,0.97,5552.179,5568.195,People experiencing homelessness can get inside and that we can show the people Seattle that there is a executive snapped and we can do this together.,78,,
432,0.97,5568.195,5580.408,"Getting these changes and sending this back, this critical conversation around relief related to Covid-19.",78,,
433,0.97,5580.408,5592.52,I know all of us here at the Council are committed to that and I look forward to this new bill and these new commitments and see if we can work something out.,78,,
434,0.97,5592.52,5598.693,I know everyone here does.,78,,
435,0.97,5598.693,5602.129,And I think this is an opportunity for us to collaborate and I welcome it.,78,,
436,0.97,5602.129,5612.44,"I thank you, Councilman Mosqueda, for sponsoring this moving to the next chapter in providing Covid-19 relief . I am hopeful that we can get it out the door.",78,,
437,0.97,5612.44,5615.943,Thank you so much.,78,,
438,0.97,5615.943,5619.947,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",79,,
439,0.97,5619.947,5623.217,Councilman Morales and Councilman Pedersen and Councilman Sawant.,79,,
440,0.97,5623.217,5634.562,"Thanks . I support this bill, I think it's important.",80,,
441,0.97,5634.562,5637.665,It helps us get real dollars out the door to families who are in the city.,80,,
442,0.97,5637.665,5657.985,"We all know that Covid-19 laid bare different systems of inequity that have left families in Seattle without income and struggling to pay their rent . has left children without Childcare, left small businesses without revenue and it's our responsibility as a counsel, Shirley, to address the budget gap that we have.",80,,
443,0.97,5657.985,5663.457,I think we have worked really hard to do that.,80,,
444,0.97,5663.457,5670.398,It's also our responsibility to protect for our constituents.,80,,
445,0.97,5670.398,5685.413,This bill allows us to support them through this immediate crisis sent we are seeing little Federal action to provide the scale and kind of support the families need.,80,,
446,0.97,5685.413,5702.029,I think this does balance our fiscal responsibility and at the same time making sure we don't turn a blind eye to the hundreds of Emails and phone calls from our constituents and service providers in the city.,80,,
447,0.97,5702.029,5707.134,We are doing everything they can to help the community.,80,,
448,0.97,5707.134,5741.368,"The last thing I want to say especially over the last few days, as we talked about this issue of stability, I think it's really important that we are careful in the kind of language we use to discuss what are admittedly very difficult policy discussions in the city especially as women and young girls are watching and especially as little girls of color are watching, I think we need to be careful about not giving the the impression that you cannot just disagree without being called on civil.",81,,
449,0.97,5741.368,5763.757,"That suggestion that having a tough policy conversation makes you somebody who's uncivil or in some way angry or a dangerous person to talk to somehow, is a message we need to make sure we are not transmitting to the little girls in our community.",81,,
450,0.97,5763.757,5789.917,"Will continue to have disagreements on this counsel, we will continue to have different policy positions and perspectives I'm sure but I want us to make sure that we are continuing to respect one another and to respect the executive branch and make sure we are sending the right message to little girls in our city but it's okay to disagree with people and that you can still use our respect from them and have respect for them.",81,,
451,0.97,5789.917,5793.821,Thank you.,81,,
452,0.97,5793.821,5797.424,"Well said, Councilman Morales.",82,,
453,0.97,5797.424,5806.433,"Appreciate you for sharing that sentiment and reminding us, always, that again, these are policy discussions, they are difficult.",82,,
454,0.97,5806.433,5814.809,It's okay for us to disagree and just because we disagree does not mean we are morally corrupt . I appreciate that reminder.,82,,
455,0.97,5814.809,5818.746,Councilman Pedersen then Councilman Sawant.,82,,
456,0.97,5818.746,5822.616,"Thank you, Council President.",83,,
457,0.97,5822.616,5838.866,I wanted to thank Councilman Mosqueda and the President for working on this strategy here which will reduce the spending to recognize that there is this additional gap in 2020.,83,,
458,0.97,5838.866,5851.946,This shows a good faith effort on the part of the city Council to move toward the executive to acknowledge the new information we have received and to get money out of the door.,83,,
459,0.97,5851.946,5854.782,I was approaching this from a different angle earlier.,83,,
460,0.97,5854.782,5858.886,I thought that was another path to get there.,83,,
461,0.97,5858.886,5860.254,This is also a valid path.,83,,
462,0.97,5860.254,5861.689,"I will support this bill, thank you.",83,,
463,0.97,5861.689,5864.058,"Thank you, Councilman Pedersen.",84,,
464,0.97,5864.058,5865.96,Councilman Sawant.,84,,
465,0.97,5865.96,5903.33,"Thank you . I would want to clarify for the members of the public who may watch in the future or are watching that something that has not been clarified by any of the Councilmembers so far that the substitute implements $26 million in austerity for $26 million in budget cuts . Every point I have made, when I spoke to the last agenda item, opposing the mayors veto, opposing budget cuts of austerity as well.",85,,
466,0.97,5903.33,5906.6,Especially in this city which has long been a tax haven for the wealthiest.,85,,
467,0.97,5906.6,5921.615,"The city Council and the Mayor should be doing everything in their power to increase the Amazon tax by whatever the shortfall is whether it's 26 million today, 50 million tomorrow, not cut the budget by those amounts.",85,,
468,0.97,5921.615,5923.651,I will be voting no on this $26 million budget cut.,85,,
469,0.97,5923.651,5924.585,Thank you.,85,,
470,0.97,5924.585,5928.956,"Thank you, Councilman Sawant.",86,,
471,0.97,5928.956,5933.36,Any other comments from my colleagues?,86,,
472,0.97,5933.36,5943.57,"Okay, I will go ahead and make a few remarks and handed over to Councilman Mosqueda in the event she have any closing remarks before we call the roll on this bill.",86,,
473,0.97,5943.57,5967.094,"I intend to support this bill, this bill would amend the appropriations found in the previous bill reflects a 34% reduction for 2020 spending in response to the Mayor's concerns that it may be administratively difficult to spend $57 million in 2020.",86,,
474,0.97,5967.094,5991.719,We have language in this amendment that acknowledges that we have the aspiration of being able to spend $57 million in 2020 but acknowledging the concern that was expressed to us by the Mayor that it may not be physically possible to set up the systems to accomplish that.,86,,
475,0.97,5991.719,6012.639,"Nonetheless, I believe that the Mayor will make a Good-Faith effort to expand these dollars and will continue to work with her and her staff Collaboratively to continue to identify how the Council can support those good faith efforts to spend these dollars.",86,,
476,0.97,6012.639,6026.053,All the while acknowledging that there are realities with how we administer these dollars that are new in some ways and into existing programs in other ways.,86,,
477,0.97,6026.053,6048.142,"Nonetheless, it is a source and revenue after that will necessitate some realities about how the dollars are administered and distributed to qualifying residents and I appreciate the difficulty and belief this bill addresses that policy concern that I heard from the Mayor.",86,,
478,0.97,6048.142,6056.083,I also heard Mayor Durkan Express concerns about the potential of Furloughs next year.,86,,
479,0.97,6056.083,6067.861,The need to preserve dollars now to mitigate against those Furloughs.,86,,
480,0.97,6067.861,6082.276,"Again, this is with relation to where we set the dial whether it's 83 million or 87 million or 57 million or some other number, 45 million, 20 million.",86,,
481,0.97,6082.276,6091.819,"Again, as chair of the committee, I share in that concern about mitigating against Furloughs of our employees.",86,,
482,0.97,6091.819,6097.124,I believe that my colleagues on the labor relations policy committee also share in that concern.,86,,
483,0.97,6097.124,6114.408,"I think we stand at the ready to work in partnership with the Mayor on mitigating against Furloughs at the city and really want to say that publicly, I appreciate that that is a real concern.",86,,
484,0.97,6114.408,6143.27,I am hearing from the Mayor that she would like to Medicate that as possible and is looking for available dollars including those in reserves to be able to use those dollars to accomplish that policy goal . I believe there is common ground on that policy goal and look forward to working in the coming month as we head into our fall budget season to be able to work together to accomplish that goal.,86,,
485,0.97,6143.27,6172.499,I also understand that there is another alternative that the Mayor would like us to consider . passage of this bill and the action that we took on overriding the veto does not preclude wife and the opportunity to have conversations about the spending that the Mayor may be able to practically effectuate in the coming months.,86,,
486,0.97,6172.499,6192.019,I remain open to those conversations to make sure that this appropriations allocation is right sized in a way that is realistic and that will meet the deep need in our community.,86,,
487,0.97,6192.019,6208.802,"So, I really have appreciated an opportunity to have conversations with the Mayor and with her staff around identifying how we can move forward and I expect that over the coming days, we will continue to have conversations.",86,,
488,0.97,6208.802,6244.371,"I hope we continue to have conversations but I believe this amendment to this bill, which is effectively an amendment to the prior bill, is a reflection of our willingness to be flexible and to Memorialize an alternative proposal that takes into account the realities around the additional revenue forecast for the remainder of 2020.",86,,
489,0.97,6244.371,6259.252,"So, colleagues, I will be excited to be voting in favor of this and also excited that we have been able to get to this point and look forward to the next few days of conversation should the Mayor be inclined to have those.",86,,
490,0.97,6259.252,6264.291,"Councilman Mosqueda, final word.",86,,
491,0.97,6264.291,6265.158,"Thank you, Madam President.",87,,
492,0.97,6265.158,6300.861,"I want to thank you, Madam president and Councilman Gonzàlez as a cosponsor and person who has provided tremendous leadership on this Iteration of the bill, I want to thank you for your work on this and to lift up what I believe Councilman Morales was saying as well, you, as the Council President, as a woman, a younger woman and a woman of color, I think are providing a great example to those young women that Councilman Morales has mentioned who are looking to our city in this crisis for leadership.",87,,
493,0.97,6300.861,6307.0,I appreciate the conversation you lead us through today and for demonstrating leadership and respect.,87,,
494,0.97,6307.0,6309.102,I appreciate that.,87,,
495,0.97,6309.102,6314.741,Thank you Councilman Morales for your comments.,87,,
496,0.97,6314.741,6330.557,And the conversation about how we can disagree and not be disagreeable and I'm looking forward to continuing to do that throughout our State and within City hall to make sure we move forward as a cohesive strategy to really provide the relief that's needed.,87,,
497,0.97,6330.557,6333.527,I believe the bill is in front of us today help offer that strategy.,87,,
498,0.97,6333.527,6335.562,I want to lift up a few pieces in this.,87,,
499,0.97,6335.562,6353.08,This bill does amend some investments so that we are able to invest in investments and Noncardiac shelter to actually redirect two additional support for homelessness prevention programs including divergent and wrap Rehousing programs.,87,,
500,0.97,6353.08,6390.617,"It also reduces the total appropriation by 3 million Codirects 200,000 to FAS our financing administrative services Department to begin the process of Lamenting the Jumpstart taxes so we can ensure there is money to replenish the funds we just spoke about before and by including 3 million for the community project, we have 1.1 million in funding that can be used for the administration and the cost to get these dollars out the door and invest in the relief that we know we need in our community.",87,,
501,0.97,6390.617,6417.511,"The remaining 3 million we will talk about in a moment as Councilman Morales has spoken about before, invest in led research and budgeting, strategy to truly take next steps on public safety and in this bill, it clarifies that we are, as Councilman Herbold spoke to, really recognizing that there could also be the potential, fingers crossed, but maybe some additional funding will come down.",87,,
502,0.97,6417.511,6423.116,Maybe they will be safe relief at one point.,87,,
503,0.97,6423.116,6429.022,We want to be safe and flexible and recognize the dollars when we can and cannot do anything that puts those dollars and danger or potentially getting reimbursed.,87,,
504,0.97,6429.022,6432.926,It has flexibility built for that in the future.,87,,
505,0.97,6432.926,6436.029,I want to be clear that this bill is an Anti-Austerity bill.,87,,
506,0.97,6436.029,6447.674,"This is an Anti-Austerity measure to help prevent folks from getting laid off, to help prevent Furloughs and to help prevent services for getting clothes.",87,,
507,0.97,6447.674,6458.285,"When we allocate $26 million, as been requested, it will help prevent people from getting laid off and allow for government services to continue in 2020.",87,,
508,0.97,6458.285,6474.701,"Much of this was anticipated for 2021 given the nature of this recession in front of us, we are pulling forward those dollars to invest in poor government services and city employees to truly prevent those Layouts and austerity measures.",87,,
509,0.97,6474.701,6483.71,"I will be the first to admit, we will have to continue to look at every strategy in front of us, a strategy that includes the fall budget.",87,,
510,0.97,6483.71,6486.379,We will have to enter our commitments around austerity are there.,87,,
511,0.97,6486.379,6500.594,"This is truly a commitment for us to make sure that the government services, city employees are able to maintain their jobs and that we are adding those poor government services exactly when our vulnerable communities needed.",87,,
512,0.97,6500.594,6512.839,"That the combination of the 26 million we have been talking about and up to 57 million going into community strategies like housing, food, small business, and Childcare.",87,,
513,0.97,6512.839,6516.81,"2011, looking forward to voting on this.",87,,

543,0.97,6593.92,6599.759,I have saved some points because I thought you were going to let Councilmembers speak to the bill after the substitution adoption.,110,,
544,0.97,6599.759,6603.129,I would like to speak now.,110,,
545,0.97,6603.129,6609.836,"Madam clerk, point of order, may I do that since we have started doing roll call?",111,,

551,0.97,6633.059,6647.44,Thank you I wanted to clarify something related to the bill coming up next and also wanted to speak in reference to comments that were just made.,114,,
552,0.97,6647.44,6657.584,"First, I support funding for the regulations to develop alternatives to depress policing and on the next agenda item, which actually funds those programs, I will be voting yes.",114,,
553,0.97,6657.584,6669.362,I would prefer that the programs be funded by Defunding the police as the justice for George Floyd movement has demanded.,114,,

555,0.97,6676.302,6691.618,"The current agenda item contains the $26 million that was just discussed in the amendment and I'm voting, I voted against substitution and I against hostility, I will vote against this bill.",114,,
556,0.97,6691.618,6723.149,"I hope members of the public listening will make note of the fact that no other Councilmember has acknowledged the point that this is austerity and austerity can be prevented by increasing the Amazon tax and other was by increasing taxes on the very wealthiest of corporations who have been taxed now because of these that, victories but in general had, have a tax haven in our city and has done so for many years.",114,,
557,0.97,6723.149,6729.122,Councilmembers are ignoring those prints because they don't want the public to a knowledge they are making a challenge to the austerity other than text business.,114,,
558,0.97,6729.122,6737.53,I am quite shocked to hear Councilmembers say that a bill that cuts the budget by 26 million is an Anti-Austerity member.,114,,
559,0.97,6737.53,6743.269,I want to clarify to the public that this is austerity and that is why we will vote against it.,114,,

561,0.97,6743.67,6748.374,"Thank you, Councilman Sawant.",115,,
