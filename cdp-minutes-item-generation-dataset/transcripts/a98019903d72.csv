222,0.97,1382.447,1388.353,We can't afford to lose trees at this pace . You all must act.,37,,

233,0.97,1429.661,1458.457,My name is Jim Davis and I live in district 7. I am one of the 50 people that came to the park overlooking the Interbay area to protest the cutting down of 36 trees in a landslide zone right below the park to build two luxury mansions with a 13 car garage and lap pool . We could not figure out how this could get approved until we discovered the loophole of the Seattle municipal code.,39,,
234,0.97,1458.457,1464.93,"Basically the building site existed before October 31st, 1992.",39,,
235,0.97,1464.93,1474.472,No rules applied for development . It seems few of the trees in this area are safe.,39,,
236,0.97,1474.472,1485.383,Deep slopes are one of the traditional havens for our trees . I would urge the Council to take action to close this loophole and not wait for the larger tree ordinance developments to close it.,39,,
237,0.97,1485.383,1486.251,Thank you.,39,,
238,0.97,1486.251,1488.086,"Thank you, James.",40,,

246,0.97,1512.878,1515.113,I won't repeat those.,41,,
247,0.97,1515.113,1517.148,My major word today is moratorium.,41,,
248,0.97,1517.148,1523.822,Moratorium on any further cutting of exceptional trees.,41,,
249,0.97,1523.822,1558.356,"And on tree growth . that needs to be enacted now . The only legislation while that moratorium is in effect that I think you should take under consideration is to make the definition of exceptional trees the same one that was used by our Speaker from Portland, who came in December of 1919 and it has been that long since we have had a presentation on a comprehensive plan and nothing has been done . The second issue I wanted to talk about was racial equity.",41,,
250,0.97,1558.356,1559.758,I think a moratorium should exist there.,41,,
251,0.97,1559.758,1578.109,The moratorium should be on any further projects and the development in poor neighborhoods that are listed where we have displacement . The racial equity report States this.,41,,
252,0.97,1578.109,1583.949,This needs to stop now because there will only be more displacement and more homeless if this continues.,41,,
253,0.97,1583.949,1584.783,Thank you very much.,41,,
254,0.97,1584.783,1585.584,"Thank you, Judith.",42,,

267,0.97,1631.529,1639.004,I wanted to bring to everyone's attention that I think there are deceiving numbers.,46,,
268,0.97,1639.004,1640.038,That being a flight attendant.,46,,
269,0.97,1640.038,1658.923,"It shows only 731 tree Removals out of 747 permits . The reason that his suspect is one, anyone who observes this will see there is typically more than one tree on the property being removed.",46,,
270,0.97,1658.923,1680.045,"And two, if you look at the raw data that some of us have seen, we have seen an average of closer to 11 trees per permit being removed, which would equate to more like 8000 trees in the city of Seattle during this time period being moved, versus 731.",46,,
271,0.97,1680.045,1697.695,"This is very important but Nevertheless, we do hope that the Department of construction will work with the Seattle urban forest Commission on a plan and it will also include Street trees and parks.",46,,

It is a reminder that the tree ordinance is very important and so is the zoning ordinance and the zoning ordinance has setbacks that are inadequate for any large trees in multifamily areas . The proposal which the city council needs to advance will study looking at improving the comprehensive plan upon policy regarding that . Otherwise, you know, all of the Pluses that the tree ordinance would advocate is not present because the ordinance would Trump them.",65,,

411,0.97,2591.889,2595.292,The process involves a call for amendments in the spring.,92,,
412,0.97,2595.292,2624.188,"In the summer, now, we review the amendment applications and receive recommendations from the planning Commission and op CD to establish the docket of items that will be considered further .

419,0.97,2703.801,2745.843,"We want to make sure there is likely to be an actual difference in change as a result of the amendments that are being proposed and finally for changes proposed to the future map which is a general picture across the city, that map is intended to be a general map that shows a general distribution of uses . It is not supposed to be a specific parcel map on each lot in the city.",92,,
420,0.97,2745.843,2761.825,There is a size threshold that we use and it generally it is consistent with the map and it doesn't require a future land use map amendment.,92,,

426,0.97,2853.116,2859.156,Consideration and future uses on this site is probably better considered in the context of that broader work.,92,,
427,0.97,2859.156,2887.05,"We have four amendments that have been proposed in the past and have been proposed again without an indication of significant change in circumstances that would merit the Council opening up again but just to briefly walk through them, the Council asked Opcd and to look at that in terms of the broader consideration of trees.",92,,

433,0.97,2930.494,2937.734,This is a major undertaking and is best suited to the major update to the plan.,92,,
434,0.97,2937.734,2943.707,We haven't ever added a new element during an annual process.,92,,
435,0.97,2943.707,2966.963,"The last item is a fee or charge for heavy vehicles and that is better addressed through other means . We don't call out fees and charges on our comprehensive plan, but rather through the municipal code.",92,,
436,0.97,2966.963,2995.092,"Attached to the memo that Eric and I have drafted is a draft resolution . In addition to item 1, which is proposed to be docketed, it list five items that have been docketed in the past and work still needs to be completed.",92,,

512,0.97,3532.528,3536.833,Property owners tend to Redevelop the property into affordable workforce housing.,105,,
513,0.97,3536.833,3546.543,As you know we are in the middle of a housing crisis and the property owner is willing to agree to Affordability levels for the life of the affordable housing project.,105,,
514,0.97,3546.543,3554.217,Therefore we respectfully request the Council change this amendment.,105,,

518,0.97,3559.556,3560.523,Hello.,107,,
519,0.97,3560.523,3578.308,"I request before my two minute start, can I ask you to please given that there is no one Testifying, you have the discretion to permit me to speak for two minutes on each of the four . each of the four detailed amendments.",107,,
520,0.97,3578.308,3589.786,You are arbitrarily going to allow discussion that really.,107,,
521,0.97,3589.786,3597.36,Your Timer has now begun.,108,,
522,0.97,3597.36,3598.361,Will you please answer?,109,,
523,0.97,3598.361,3598.761,No.,110,,
524,0.97,3598.761,3600.997,You will have the same time allotted to all.,110,,
525,0.97,3600.997,3605.868,As usual--forgive me.,111,,
526,0.97,3605.868,3610.306,"As usual, the Council is being very High-Handed and arbitrary.",111,,
527,0.97,3610.306,3621.117,"The only amendment you are advancing is, you know, a friendly amendment by a fellow Councilmember . You are not taking seriously the proposals from the public.",111,,
528,0.97,3621.117,3633.029,"Your staff has failed to address actual recent changes addressed in my application and even since then, they have required each of these to be studied.",111,,
529,0.97,3633.029,3646.442,The heat that kills people is a significantly caused by the lack of large trees and the multi family zoning doesn't promote large trees anymore.,111,,
530,0.97,3646.442,3659.255,"Number five, the policy is inconsistent because it has a good policy for downtown but it needs to be extended to all of the urban villages.",111,,
531,0.97,3659.255,3674.537,"Under number six, the city has been operating under an emergency with very, very poor outreach and democratic processes during the Coronavirus crisis . I have proposed improvements . It is a very significant need.",111,,
532,0.97,3674.537,3686.282,The city needs to study whether it is going to be desirable to have an Appendix or a new element.,111,,
533,0.97,3686.282,3689.218,"That can be decided later, but don't refuse to study something.",111,,
534,0.97,3689.218,3718.014,"Finally, the Seattle bridge destruction has been acknowledged as being partly caused by extra heavy vehicles, most of which according to an S.Study that I have revealed for you has been caused by City- owned and county owned vehicles or charter vehicles by the city and County.",111,,
535,0.97,3718.014,3719.415,"Thank you, Mr. Lehman.",112,,
536,0.97,3719.415,3725.688,That was our last Speaker remotely present.,112,,
537,0.97,3725.688,3729.592,Sorry.,112,,
538,0.97,3729.592,3732.295,That was the last Speaker remotely present to speak at the public hearing.,112,,
539,0.97,3732.295,3737.733,The public hearing on the docket Seconding resolution is closed.,112,,
540,0.97,3737.733,3741.938,Thank you to everyone who provided comments today.,112,,

542,0.97,3755.985,3766.562,"Lehman, I know staff from my office have spoken with you outside the public comment as well . colleagues, any other questions?",112,,
543,0.97,3766.562,3768.531,I would love to move us along.,112,,
544,0.97,3768.531,3768.965,Nope!,113,,
545,0.97,3768.965,3775.271,"Thank you, Councilmember Juarez.",114,,

549,0.97,3789.085,3789.685,Thank you.,117,,
550,0.97,3789.685,3802.498,We are joined by Rico Quirindongo and Michael Hubner.,117,,
551,0.97,3802.498,3805.468,Feel free to ask questions along the way.,117,,
552,0.97,3805.468,3813.209,"Director, Michael, please take it away.",117,,
553,0.97,3813.209,3823.419,I might ask Noah to share his screen.,118,,
554,0.97,3823.419,3825.822,"I will share from my end, so no need to do that.",118,,
555,0.97,3825.822,3828.09,I will turn it over to Rico Quirindongo . Thank you.,118,,
556,0.97,3828.09,3828.925,"Thank you, Michael.",119,,
557,0.97,3828.925,3845.541,"Thank you, Councilmembers . I know this presentation and report and discussion has been facilitated for white sometime and we are excited to be here and I am happy to be able to deliver the reports.",119,,
558,0.97,3845.541,3858.921,"As Michael will share as we get into his presentation material, this is just the very, very first step of a huge body of work that we will need to move into with the comprehensive plan.",119,,
559,0.97,3858.921,3862.024,Major updates.,119,,
560,0.97,3862.024,3869.732,I think this is an important first step and it is the first step of a larger conversation.,119,,
561,0.97,3869.732,3883.045,"With that, I will turn it over to Mr. Hubner . take it away.",119,,
562,0.97,3883.813,3887.35,There we go.,120,,
563,0.97,3887.35,3901.797,"Thank you, Mr. chair and Councilmembers . Thank you for having us today.",121,,
564,0.97,3901.797,3912.808,"It is important we begin the comprehensive plan update process, the process reviewing this work.",121,,
565,0.97,3912.808,3925.388,"I will go through this relatively quickly to allow time to take your questions, but feel free if there are pressing questions for clarity along the way, let us know.",121,,
566,0.97,3925.388,3929.425,"First of all, some grounding in the comprehensive plan.",121,,
567,0.97,3929.425,3949.312,"This is a 20 year plan that guides how the city rose . It covers land use, the location and a density of a development, infrastructure and services, policies on housing and economic development, really shaping so many asked acts of what the city does over time.",121,,
568,0.97,3949.312,3959.322,It SETS high level of policy and four gold values.,121,,
569,0.97,3959.322,3962.958,"Racial and social equity, environmental stewardship, community, and economic opportunity and security.",121,,
570,0.97,3962.958,3972.935,The plan is a requirement of the state growth management Act and we are required as a city to update that plan.,121,,
571,0.97,3972.935,3975.771,The next update is due in 2024 and that happens once every eight years.,121,,
572,0.97,3975.771,3983.679,"As an early step in the current plan process, we conducted this racial equity analysis.",121,,
573,0.97,3983.679,3990.586,This has been noted in response to a slide from the budget cycle a couple of years ago.,121,,
574,0.97,3990.586,3992.588,A couple of things have happened.,121,,
575,0.97,3992.588,3999.895,The state changed the deadline Fr the comprehensive plan update from 2023 to 2024.,121,,
576,0.97,3999.895,4012.174,With us poised to launch the update of the comprehensive plan later this year.,121,,
577,0.97,4012.174,4017.213,The release of this report is timed to be the first step as we move from the beginning of the planning process in late 2021.,121,,
578,0.97,4017.213,4021.083,This is a look back at the current comprehensive plan.,121,,
579,0.97,4021.083,4024.32,Really asking Foundational questions on whether the plan is living up to its promise.,121,,
580,0.97,4024.32,4031.827,Asking Westerns about who benefits and who is harmed by the growth that is happening in the city as shaped by the plan.,121,,
581,0.97,4031.827,4043.205,How can the comprehensive plan update be improved to achieve more equitable racial outcomes going forward?,121,,
582,0.97,4043.205,4046.642,"To do this work, we thought it was extremely important to bring in an independent perspective.",121,,
583,0.97,4046.642,4053.349,"We selected a policy link, a national nonprofit and equitable policy.",121,,
584,0.97,4053.349,4077.339,"We worked with the city when we last updated the plan in 2014 and 2015, so this was an opportunity for them to follow up with us and provide assistance as we take on the next update and starting that process before we even begin or launch the work with the community or around analysis and policy development.",121,,
585,0.97,4077.339,4097.86,"This is Foundational both in setting the scope for the update but also setting us up for a racial equity Toolkit, which is a more formalized and deeper and broader public engagement process, which addresses many racial disparities we will be covering today.",121,,
586,0.97,4097.86,4114.109,"As I mentioned the update process is a several year process . We are currently in the first year of that process, which is mostly about project planning and setting the scope for work we will ramp up later this year.",121,,
587,0.97,4114.109,4115.711,The racial analysis is part of that work.,121,,
588,0.97,4115.711,4132.595,"As we move toward a more intensive period of planning and policy development later this year and into 2022, that work will be informed by outreach to Stakeholders and neighborhoods citywide.",121,,
589,0.97,4132.595,4147.042,The responsiveness to state law and regional policies and also data and analysis including environmental impact statement we anticipate will be needed for the policy act.,121,,
590,0.97,4147.042,4152.114,There are two primary Deliverables from this process.,121,,
591,0.97,4152.114,4155.15,One is a community engagement report.,121,,
592,0.97,4155.15,4162.258,I will briefly summarize the activities we did on community engagement.,121,,
593,0.97,4162.258,4169.965,As well as a final memo from a policy link for findings and recommendations.,121,,
594,0.97,4169.965,4186.382,"As highlighted in the slide itself, the racial equity analysis focused specifically on the implications of the strategy . The urban village strategy has been a Seattle growth strategy since 1994.",121,,
595,0.97,4186.382,4196.392,"In brief, it aims to focus housing and jobs within the designated compact neighborhoods linked by transit.",121,,
596,0.97,4196.392,4205.1,Will in focusing that group in that housing.,121,,
597,0.97,4205.1,4225.02,"The urban village strategy, however, when it was first enacted in the Mid-1990S was not analyzed from a racial equity perspective so many questions we are bringing forward are being asked for the first time about this Foundational strategy and comprehensive plan.",121,,
598,0.97,4225.02,4251.213,"In addressing the urban village strategy, we took a citywide perspective on not just being at the villages themselves, the communities that historically have been at the most locations, but also where a large portion of the city outside of the villages are owned for single-family development.",121,,
599,0.97,4251.213,4268.03,"These are areas in which historically have excluded people of color by means of racist actions for the public and private sectors, such as Redlining and racial covenants.",121,,
600,0.97,4268.03,4285.814,That exclusion continues today and escalating cost of buying a single-family home is an extremely high barrier that disproportionately impacts people of color and their ability to access outside the villages.,121,,
601,0.97,4285.814,4297.459,"If we take a look at this map, we can see the locations and boundaries of the villages were to be compared with the Redlining map in the 1930s.",121,,
602,0.97,4297.459,4305.868,It echoes many historical patterns which were established over that historical period.,121,,
603,0.97,4305.868,4320.883,"In order to evaluate where we are today and looking over to the update we provided with several recent data reports, Opcd has monitored our progress over time.",121,,
604,0.97,4320.883,4333.095,"Most prominently the equitable development program with community indicator report, our racial equity and displacement.",121,,
605,0.97,4333.095,4337.533,Within the limited scope--yes?,121,,
606,0.97,4337.533,4339.635,"Oh, our vice chair had a question.",122,,
607,0.97,4339.635,4341.503,She will hold the question.,122,,
608,0.97,4341.503,4344.84,No problem.,123,,
609,0.97,4344.84,4351.947,We have conducted several limited opportunities for engagement as part of the scope for the first step on the update.,123,,
610,0.97,4351.947,4357.052,That targeted engagement included training of liaisons.,123,,
611,0.97,4357.052,4374.069,"The company has a plan and a strategy conducting five focus groups with communities of color and different neighborhoods of the city, and conducting a citywide workshop in partnership with policy that occurred in October of last year.",123,,
612,0.97,4374.069,4388.484,The image on the right provides a window into the kind of engagement we did with communities looking at the assets in their communities both inside and around some of the existing urban villages.,123,,
613,0.97,4388.484,4395.524,"So very briefly, policy links key findings fall under four main topic areas.",123,,
614,0.97,4395.524,4417.579,"One, housing Affordability, choice, and ownership . In each of these four areas, they have highlighted from our data, conversations with community, persistent racial disparities which relate to some of the policies and strategies in the comprehensive plan in which the update could potentially address as we look forward.",123,,
615,0.97,4417.579,4434.129,"In terms of housing, the supply of affordable housing has not and it does not need to meet the needs as evidenced of our cost data and other reports.",123,,
616,0.97,4434.129,4443.739,"The units that would meet particular household needs, such as affordable family sized units are not available in the market.",123,,
617,0.97,4443.739,4454.75,"There is a significant gap in homeownership, especially for black households compared to white households in the city.",123,,
618,0.97,4454.75,4471.834,"On the topic of access to opportunity, policy will look at both neighborhoods historically communities of color and the history of Underinvestment in those neighborhoods.",123,,
619,0.97,4471.834,4498.393,"It has resulted in reduced access to elements of opportunity for people living there as well as was noted the exclusion from many other areas of the city . barriers to access the opportunities in those neighborhoods, such as the parks, tree canopy that has been talked about the public comment today, schools, and other elements of a healthy environment.",123,,
620,0.97,4498.393,4539.835,"Policy link looked at this placement risk as highlighted the impacts of the housing insecurity broadly on my pocket communities and displacement was particularly Impacting communities within urban villages, where limitation on housing choices and Affordability combined with segregation . much of the new development pressure on the city being planned for this villages is increasing the displacement in those communities to have lived there historically and continue to.",123,,
621,0.97,4539.835,4542.504,And finally access to Seattle's economic prosperity.,123,,
622,0.97,4542.504,4555.717,We have been experiencing as a city a very prolonged and enriching period of economic growth.,123,,
623,0.97,4555.717,4563.625,Many of the people who historically are in communities of color have not benefited from that growth.,123,,
624,0.97,4563.625,4566.461,That is revealed in the data.,123,,
625,0.97,4566.461,4579.474,We have data on household in the city as well as from the community engagement conversations we have had in the focus groups and workshop.,123,,
626,0.97,4579.474,4581.476,"Thank you, Mr. Hubner.",124,,
627,0.97,4581.476,4591.653,"Before we move on, Councilmember Mosqueda has a question on that last slide.",124,,
628,0.97,4591.653,4592.454,"Thank you, Michael.",125,,
629,0.97,4592.454,4606.501,"I was trying to hold a lot of my questions and comments until the end but on the previous slide and the flight before that, what is the uniqueness of this analysis and how does this analysis help advance our understanding or our comprehension of the policy changes yet to be made?",125,,
630,0.97,4606.501,4614.009,"I have had folks say this has been studied time and time again, so what is different here?",125,,
631,0.97,4614.009,4628.59,I am wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the connection you have talked about between these persistent racial disparities and how there is an overlap with the Redlining policies of the past?,125,,
632,0.97,4628.59,4647.109,"I think we sort of faded quickly and move on because we have seen some of the maps that overlap but if you have anything else to explain to someone coming to Seattle for the first time it isn't as familiar with the history, where that data and Analytical connection really comes from when you look at the overlay.",125,,
633,0.97,4647.109,4651.346,Do you have a second to look at that?,125,,
634,0.97,4651.346,4652.414,Sure.,126,,
635,0.97,4652.414,4669.064,"I think what is unique, the policy link brought an exploration of the history.",126,,
636,0.97,4669.064,4681.376,"That was not a history that was in any way as thoroughly documented going into previous updates, such as the history of Redlining and Docketing.",126,,
637,0.97,4681.376,4697.292,History helped shape our Land- use in the city with respect to our earlier comprehensive plans even going back to the 1950s or earlier through initial zoning.,126,,
638,0.97,4697.292,4699.494,Zoning was initially adopted in the 1920s.,126,,
639,0.97,4699.494,4723.885,"From a historical perspective, showing how through designing an urban village strategy in the original 1994 comprehensive plan, that history was inherited and carried forward.",126,,
640,0.97,4723.885,4766.828,"That strategy has not changed since 1994 and combining that historical perspective with some of the new data which shows the profound and growing racial disparities and racial equity outcomes related to displacement, related to the wealth gap, related to the economic benefits of job growth . I think it is unique and policy link specifically comments on and provides information that relates to the growth strategy and how we might address a new growth strategy and more racially equitable way moving forward.",126,,
641,0.97,4766.828,4773.034,Those are not questions that were brought together or highlighted through previous updates.,126,,
642,0.97,4773.034,4773.668,Very helpful.,127,,
643,0.97,4773.668,4788.483,Thank you for that . I may be reaching back out to further draw out how some of those policies from the 20s in the 50s reiterated or reinforced some of our previous zoning and public policies.,127,,
644,0.97,4788.483,4821.583,"I think you answered it very eloquently and I was reminded when somebody asked me that how many people have moved to the city within the last 10 years and some of this history might not be as well-known, especially since the plan is only updated every 8 to 10 years so given how infrequently general members of the public may be hearing about some of these policies, I thought that was an important thing to really draw out and you really helped my understanding advance as well.",127,,
645,0.97,4821.583,4823.218,Thank you for being able to answer that.,127,,
646,0.97,4823.218,4824.419,I really appreciate it.,127,,
647,0.97,4824.419,4826.688,You are very welcome.,128,,
648,0.97,4826.688,4847.809,I think that the following slides will help as well to address that point as we look forward to what the update itself will entail in terms of the kind of work and questions we will be addressing . Let me quickly on this next slide to cover some of the recommendations for the comprehensive plan update itself in the Policylink memo.,128,,
649,0.97,4847.809,4850.412,One is in the area of the growth strategy itself.,128,,
650,0.97,4850.412,4861.623,"Policylink calls on the city to look at two ways to allow more housing types across the city, not just in urban villages.",128,,
651,0.97,4861.623,4884.779,"Particularly in areas that are currently zoned for Single- family, but also pair that with a very strong point about doing so in a way that would provide equitable access to housing, affordable housing, and wealth building opportunities to households of color .

654,0.97,4894.689,4904.266,Really starting from that observation in the data that we quite simply don't have enough affordable housing in the city.,128,,
655,0.97,4904.266,4916.678,The comprehensive plan can and should do more to support housing Affordability and affordable units that meet's of communities in particular.,128,,
656,0.97,4916.678,4927.255,"On displacement, more and stronger policies recommend should be in the plan . I particularly calling out the preservation of cultural communities.",128,,

664,0.97,5002.23,5018.613,We do anticipate at least over the next 25 years we have a good idea how many housing units we can the city will need over the next 20 to 25 years and it is a lot more we plan for.,128,,
665,0.97,5018.613,5065.56,"We anticipate 70,000 units . We are looking at a housing need of 112 or more thousand units over the next 25 years . We have a big job ahead of us and in doing so, we are studying a range of growth strategy alternatives to meet our housing need consistent with the budget proviso that the council passed this year . We will be fully looking at at least one alternative that looks at new housing opportunities in single-family areas including Duplexes, Triplex is, Townhomes, and other middle housing that could address racial disparities highlighted in this report.",128,,
666,0.97,5065.56,5079.941,"In doing so, affordable and mixed income housing is so pressing we needed in the city and specifically strategies we can demonstrate will benefit households.",128,,

668,0.97,5089.317,5110.805,I was happy to see your import include the broader range of housing types . I look forward to working with you on this because this slide demonstrates the duplex on the upper left corner . It looks like a standard single-family house.,129,,
669,0.97,5110.805,5120.582,"You know, as I am looking at these picked yours as well understanding each of those Townhomes also provides housing for likely a single-family.",129,,
670,0.97,5120.582,5125.019,Even though their walls connect.,129,,
671,0.97,5125.019,5128.923,I just wanted to let you know that I am excited to work with you on this.,129,,
672,0.97,5128.923,5153.648,"I know throughout my community, there are many Duplexes that are legacy Duplexes in what zoning prohibits those Duplexes .

677,0.97,5166.06,5169.564,"Did you say 140,000?",130,,
678,0.97,5169.564,5186.981,"Our growth target, which is currently working through the county process of setting growth targets for cities calls for at least 112 thousand new housing units by 2024.",131,,

683,0.97,5190.485,5201.195,"Am I correct that the number of units in our region still in the King County region is north of 400,000?",132,,
684,0.97,5201.195,5211.806,"112,000 is the expected growth target but the broader number for our County, do you remember that number offhand wax",132,,

691,0.97,5254.449,5284.879,"Also consistent with the budget, with the last slide we anticipate Anti-Displacement measures into at least one . I would anticipate really all of the alternative that we would be looking at through this process and Anti-Displacement is a central to the work we would be doing to look at a range of ways the city could grow for the next few years starting with updating and enhancing our risk mapping.",135,,
692,0.97,5284.879,5309.003,There is the map from the previous comprehensive plan shown right here and broadening our view of Anti-Displacement policies to not only address housing but small businesses and other aspects of displacement in the city and identifying ways to plan to help mitigate going forward and to go beyond the current plan.,135,,
693,0.97,5309.003,5372.667,"In the area of inclusive economy, Policylink was very strong on this . It is not about housing or land use . It is about economic opportunity as well and ways in which the comprehensive plan starting with advanced data through a background research, but really try to identify policy gaps and opportunities for more integrated approach between land use and development policies in the plan and what the plan calls for in terms of connecting people with those opportunities and those jobs through education and job training, other policies that could elevate those kinds of tools as well as integrating, as it was mentioned earlier, the work on the industrial Maritime strategy which was recently released . It highlights and Furthers the growth of middle wage jobs, lower barrier good paying jobs in the city.",135,,
694,0.97,5372.667,5387.648,"That is also going to be an important piece of the comprehensive land picture as we go through the update and incorporating those industrial policies in both Land-Use and economic development . and finally, community engagement.",135,,
695,0.97,5387.648,5393.621,Policylink calls for a broader engagement with communities.,135,,

697,0.97,5413.074,5423.885,We are going to be exploring options for Resourcing equitable community engagement as well as the Importane of going citywide with this work to engage with Stakeholders in neighborhoods across the city.,135,,
698,0.97,5423.885,5444.739,Some of the Foundational fundamental changes we are exploring through this update will really be part of a citywide conversation about the future of this city . We will bring a community engagement plan to you later this year as we look to launch the update sometime in the fourth quarter.,135,,

708,0.97,5485.646,5505.099,"Thank you, chair Strauss . I just wanted to clarify some of the math . 112,000 units, you're talking about the city of Seattle needing that by 2044?",139,,
709,0.97,5505.099,5506.167,Yes.,140,,
710,0.97,5506.167,5510.204,Is that 4500 unit?,141,,
711,0.97,5510.204,5517.712,5000 units a year?,141,,
712,0.97,5517.712,5526.821,"It is my understanding the office of housing based on their most recent report, the office of housing helped to subsidize the production of 2500 units last year.",141,,
713,0.97,5526.821,5535.93,That would leave 2500 units a year basically.,141,,
714,0.97,5535.93,5557.118,"Our housing need, the 112,000 units includes housing at all income levels . It would be a market rate housing and rent and income restricted housing that would result from the office of housing or rather other partners . It would really be both.",142,,
715,0.97,5557.118,5566.06,For a total of 112 at least.,142,,
716,0.97,5566.06,5567.862,That is a floor under the growth management act.,142,,
717,0.97,5567.862,5580.474,Our recently completed analysis focused on market rate housing indicates that the likely need is higher than 112 but we have to plan for at least 112 for growth.,142,,
718,0.97,5580.474,5580.875,Okay.,143,,
719,0.97,5580.875,5583.945,Thank you for clarifying that.,143,,
720,0.97,5583.945,5593.087,"In terms of the urban village strategy, that was devised in the 1990s . is that correct?",143,,
721,0.97,5593.087,5594.488,That is correct.,144,,
722,0.97,5594.488,5595.456,Okay.,145,,

729,0.97,5619.313,5647.742,"Then chair Strauss, I will have other comments and questions later but related to Councilmember Pedersen's question about the comprehensive plan and the 2035 plan developed in 1994, I think that question is a really good illustration that this conversation has a relatively long history here in Seattle and the longer history of where the policies are rooted in Redlining policies of the past.",147,,
730,0.97,5647.742,5654.448,More specific to the 2030 Seattle plan that was developed in the year 1990.,147,,
731,0.97,5654.448,5661.155,This is another question I continue to get from communities . where are we at in the process?,147,,
732,0.97,5661.155,5662.356,How often is it updated?,147,,
733,0.97,5662.356,5667.662,What is the difference in terms of when minor changes or major changes can be made?,147,,
734,0.97,5667.662,5699.293,"I have been recently asked that the Timeline of the plan, do you mind orienting us one more time to how we are striving to accomplish the goals as you have noted in your Powerpoint presentation, the goal of having a plan that changes social equity priorities, a commitment to community and security?",147,,
735,0.97,5699.293,5715.509,"That was supposed to be part of our Seattle 2035 plan, but where are we at in terms of making those updates and making changes, and why are we starting this conversation now?",147,,
736,0.97,5715.509,5728.389,"I will make a brief comment on the Timeline and if the director is here, he might want to provide high-level comments on the scope.",148,,
737,0.97,5728.389,5732.893,"Mr. Hubner, just quickly, can you stop sharing the screen?",149,,
738,0.97,5732.893,5734.695,I will turn it off.,150,,
739,0.97,5734.695,5736.43,Great.,151,,
740,0.97,5736.43,5741.969,Thank you.,151,,
741,0.97,5747.374,5751.345,I will attempt to turn it off while I am answering questions.,152,,
742,0.97,5751.345,5752.379,There we go.,152,,
743,0.97,5752.379,5757.618,Okay.,152,,
744,0.97,5757.618,5759.353,I think I was just overridden.,152,,
745,0.97,5759.353,5760.654,Thank you.,152,,
746,0.97,5760.654,5771.866,"The Timeline for the update, it is updating a comprehensive plan and it is a lengthy process . The last update took three years to update and complete.",152,,
747,0.97,5771.866,5780.074,"Reasons for that, the depth of the community engagement first and foremost.",152,,
748,0.97,5780.074,5803.898,"The scope with respect to incorporating new growth projections and accommodating those in our future land use map and doing environmental review that is required to analyze the potential impact of that growth on the transportation system, the environment, et cetera.",152,,
749,0.97,5803.898,5806.801,We do anticipate this will take three years.,152,,
750,0.97,5806.801,5808.002,That is starting now.,152,,
751,0.97,5808.002,5815.676,"We are three years prior to June, 2024.",152,,

753,0.97,5835.129,5838.832,2022 will be a big year for the update.,152,,
754,0.97,5838.832,5866.06,"During that time period, we will be defining alternatives to study including alternative concepts we have talked about today and going through a period of a draft plan 2022 and 2023. there will be important milestones for involvement and for interaction as well as we get through that process.",152,,
755,0.97,5866.06,5867.795,The vice chair might have a question.,153,,
756,0.97,5867.795,5869.363,Go for it.,153,,
757,0.97,5869.363,5885.546,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss . I would add in addition to Michael's comments, you know, even an update is a very heavy lift.",154,,
758,0.97,5885.546,5926.62,"It does take effort and a subsequent time on community engagement and also the amount of staff work that goes into the effort I would NOTE we have half a dozen plans . those are today on funded efforts, which is some thing I would like to have a conversation with the council about.",154,,
759,0.97,5926.62,5930.024,There is a huge amount of work to do there.,154,,
760,0.97,5930.024,5942.102,"In addition to the virtual equity lens, it was not part of the conversation with the update we are approaching today.",154,,
761,0.97,5942.102,5946.74,We have a lot of ground to cover.,154,,
762,0.97,5946.74,5960.354,I really appreciate the Council's support in this . We have to be doing this in a bigger way and better way.,154,,
763,0.97,5960.354,5962.957,That has been done to start the next conversation.,154,,
764,0.97,5962.957,5963.557,Thank you.,155,,
765,0.97,5963.557,5966.026,That is helpful.,155,,
766,0.97,5966.026,5973.734,"I have a similar question to Councilmember Mosqueda, who might focus it a little bit more.",155,,
767,0.97,5973.734,5977.371,I am hearing that the public's best opportunity to engage in this work is in 2022.,155,,
768,0.97,5977.371,5977.971,Is that correct?,155,,
769,0.97,5977.971,5987.781,Should people begin engaging now? What is the best way for them to engage?,155,,
770,0.97,5987.781,5989.183,"Michael, join me to start that?",156,,
771,0.97,5989.183,5990.384,Why don't you start that.,157,,
772,0.97,5990.384,5990.617,Yes.,157,,
773,0.97,5990.617,5993.354,We have a robust community that we need to develop.,158,,
774,0.97,5993.354,5998.292,That plan is not in place currently.,158,,
775,0.97,5998.292,6009.503,We are coming out of Covid . one of our challenges is me know meeting people where they are at has actually in some ways been better in a virtual format.,158,,
776,0.97,6009.503,6019.413,People have been able to have a meeting and still take care of their kids.,158,,
777,0.97,6019.413,6073.133,"We need to develop a plan that allows people to have the flexibility to still show up in that way and also meet people where they are at to talk about the work we are doing, but in ways that are accessible and common language . You know, we are intended to do a soft launch in the fall . all of the community engagement tools we have now Online surveys and the Website and the virtual format meetings as well, all of those will just come to bear . We do not have a plan in place yet, but Michael, do you have anything?",158,,
778,0.97,6073.133,6079.173,"What I would add to that, and this was an important slide, this is the first step in the racial equity Toolkit.",159,,
779,0.97,6079.173,6138.899,"The racial equity Toolkit has at its core community engagement with impacted communities . Our community engagement plan as well as the next steps involve bringing the communities together to help define the racial equity outcomes, to help define the alternatives and policies that can and should be explored to mitigate harm . all of those really key questions happen through community engagement and we are very much going to design our approach around the racial equity Toolkit process while at the same time having that citywide conversation of the future of this fast-growing city facing so many challenges . race and equity at the center of that process.",159,,
780,0.97,6138.899,6139.9,Great.,160,,
781,0.97,6139.9,6152.713,"I think for me, it kind of highlights--and another comprehensive plan can be confusing because we have annual Docketing, which all leads up to the major update.",160,,
782,0.97,6152.713,6160.42,We have the annual process in which we are engaging with just earlier this morning.,160,,
783,0.97,6160.42,6165.459,That leads to this major update in which we are talking about.,160,,
784,0.97,6165.459,6180.741,"You know, one of the things I am interested in discussing in the future is regarding our annual amendment process . I would like to note I am interested in a future racial at the analysis of the minor comprehensive plan.",160,,
785,0.97,6180.741,6189.049,I will hold that request now because I don't want to confuse the work between the major update and our annual update.,160,,
786,0.97,6189.049,6199.193,I will note that will be helpful and useful for us in the future as we docket items.,160,,

791,0.97,6213.574,6248.408,"Another question to build off of what answered your question, Mr. chair, and Michael, thanks for your response . I agree that I think one thing that makes this report unique is the data compiled by Policylink and your team and also the way in which this report was grounded in community experience and having not on the ground experience really informed the policy recommendations versus looking at data or sitting in a closed door room somewhere.",161,,
792,0.97,6248.408,6263.557,"If you look at slide 10, through the contracting experience with Policylink, we work directly through these focus groups . I understand the frustration around the delay.",161,,
793,0.97,6263.557,6266.66,"Covid has delayed many very important things of the city, this being one.",161,,
794,0.97,6266.66,6283.076,"If you look at that report and you look at the conversations that took place in community, I am really inspired that this report is unique and includes data and experience.",161,,
795,0.97,6283.076,6292.052,I think that is one thing that makes this unique.,161,,
796,0.97,6292.052,6292.653,Just two questions.,161,,
797,0.97,6292.653,6296.89,"Number one, I would love to have a better understanding of the analysis that went into the data that was reviewed.",161,,
798,0.97,6296.89,6299.359,I am wondering if your team was able to make that possible.,161,,
799,0.97,6299.359,6307.167,I would love to see the data compiled and how that analysis came together and the two related to community engagement.,161,,
800,0.97,6307.167,6317.21,"Again, I am very thankful for my team working to create requirements around this slide and a strategy there.",161,,
801,0.97,6317.21,6323.884,I am wondering when we can ask act that plan.,161,,
802,0.97,6323.884,6336.93,"Really quickly on the first Western, all of the data was provided to Policylink and previously published data analysis from other partners.",162,,
803,0.97,6336.93,6348.742,I am happy to point you to which reports that have been well documented in the work.,162,,
804,0.97,6348.742,6349.943,I want to cover the timing.,162,,
805,0.97,6349.943,6352.145,We are trying to expedite that as well as we can.,162,,
806,0.97,6352.145,6356.049,One important piece was finishing this work to inform that.,162,,
807,0.97,6356.049,6370.363,There is a little bit of sequencing we are trying to bring that to you before the end of the year so we can launch the engagement during that fourth quarter.,162,,
808,0.97,6370.363,6378.438,"Councilmember Mosqueda, we want to do a soft launch in the fourth quarter.",163,,
809,0.97,6378.438,6400.093,We need to do work on our end and we want to be able to make that presentation . We need to coordinate that with many other things . It will be important for that time . The exact time is not clear yet.,163,,
810,0.97,6400.093,6404.965,We will work with Councilmember Strauss and get it all lined up.,163,,
811,0.97,6404.965,6417.911,"We can try to give you a preview . I think that is something we can at least provide and schedule soon, like within the next 30 days.",163,,
812,0.97,6417.911,6419.513,Wonderful.,164,,
813,0.97,6419.513,6423.283,That is great news.,164,,
814,0.97,6423.283,6424.885,"Thank you, director.",164,,
815,0.97,6424.885,6435.228,"Thank you, Mr. Hubner . do we have questions on this item?",164,,
816,0.97,6435.228,6437.03,"Vice chair, please take it away.",164,,
817,0.97,6437.03,6442.536,"Thank you so much, Mr. chair.",165,,
818,0.97,6442.536,6447.04,"I don't have any questions but I would love to make a few comments, if this is the appropriate time.",165,,
819,0.97,6447.04,6461.454,"Again, thank you very much, director Rico Quirindongo and Michael, we appreciate your office's work to make sure we have this item on the agenda.",165,,
820,0.97,6461.454,6462.656,Today is a really exciting day.,165,,
821,0.97,6462.656,6466.526,I was filled with Goosebumps as we were beginning this presentation.,165,,
822,0.97,6466.526,6468.562,It was a labor of love and long anticipated.,165,,
823,0.97,6468.562,6474.668,I think the community comments were worth waiting for.,165,,
824,0.97,6474.668,6478.538,We are waiting to see how we can incorporate that feedback in the future.,165,,
825,0.97,6478.538,6481.575,People felt safe and were able to participate in a Covid here.,165,,
826,0.97,6481.575,6523.516,"That was important . The Analytical data combined with these anecdotal comments I think really helped fuel the need for us to act with urgency, so wanted to thank the advocate and community members that have been working very hard to make sure we Greenlight the information present in this study and we brought forward as ace Eddie a process for updating the comprehensive plan that is truly rooted in what the community needs . One other thing that makes this report so unique, we are moving away from this perception that we need to only do development or only focus on Anti-Displacement strategies.",165,,
827,0.97,6523.516,6530.524,The report clearly shows we need a both and approach.,165,,
828,0.97,6530.524,6534.794,Both need to be rooted in what the community is calling for.,165,,
829,0.97,6534.794,6548.141,They are at most risk for able to access homeownership opportunities in high opportunity neighborhoods and have great affordable housing across the city.,165,,
830,0.97,6548.141,6558.151,I just want to say thank you to everybody that has been working on this . It was definitely an impressive report and I appreciate the data has been shared in many different ways.,165,,
831,0.97,6558.151,6560.554,You can see this on slide nine.,165,,
832,0.97,6560.554,6584.744,"The information provided from policy complements what we have known for a long . It is incredibly important, as you have heard, to have the data and those lived experiences root our strategies for how we change the comprehensive land over the next three years . This is the launching of and a sort of the analysis of what needs to change internally.",165,,
833,0.97,6584.744,6592.485,I really appreciate Michael and Rico Quirindongo's response to why this is important.,165,,
834,0.97,6592.485,6606.499,"Given that 8 to 10 year reflection point, we are starting now on a process that will lead to deep community engagement in 2022 with policy suggestions and improvements in 2023 so we can act on those with urgency.",165,,
835,0.97,6606.499,6619.412,"I know to some that may be painfully slow, especially when you hear our current policies do have roots in and overlay with racist policies of the past . We can't ignore that.",165,,
836,0.97,6619.412,6624.384,"I think, Michael, your answer was very well said and Alec went.",165,,
837,0.97,6624.384,6642.235,It is just a fact those earlier policies pulled him Exclusionary policies and we must now with this information and with our Toolkit commitments Realign our values with what our housing and zoning policies truly say.,165,,
838,0.97,6642.235,6645.038,I wanted to thank all of you for your engagement here.,165,,
839,0.97,6645.038,6656.249,"Councilmember Strauss, you were on council as well in 2008 . We passed the racial equity Toolkit and folded that into our 2019 budget process.",165,,
840,0.97,6656.249,6662.122,I want to thank Michael Maddox for his work on that.,165,,
841,0.97,6662.122,6667.227,He brought this to my attention through calls for action from community members.,165,,
842,0.97,6667.227,6673.066,Michael helped informed me at the time why this information was so important and spearheaded the effort to include this in the budget.,165,,
843,0.97,6673.066,6674.134,We built off of that.,165,,
844,0.97,6674.134,6678.972,I want to thank Aaron house that has been in my office since 2009.,165,,
845,0.97,6678.972,6689.282,"With their work, we have built on commitment for the comprehensive plan.",165,,
846,0.97,6689.282,6694.654,We dug deeper into our growth strategies and came up with a path forward for how we can address changes that are needed by doing two things.,165,,
847,0.97,6694.654,6706.966,We require the facial equity Toolkit . We are having this conversation.,165,,
848,0.97,6706.966,6721.481,"In 2020, we require the environmental impact statement for the comprehensive plan update, that document that sets forth our policy and options to include at least an option for evaluating and ending the apartment Van in Seattle.",165,,
849,0.97,6721.481,6730.79,"That means changing zoning laws and allowing for bigger density, so the plan will have an analysis of that as we move forward.",165,,
850,0.97,6730.79,6735.929,"Thank you, Mr. chair, for your support over the last few years as well.",165,,
851,0.97,6735.929,6747.373,We required a policy to come alongside any zoning options to make sure we were doing just what this report followed.,165,,
852,0.97,6747.373,6761.654,Both approaches recognize how important it is for building the housing staff but addressing what our Bipoc community needs and correcting Missteps of the past that really reinforced Exclusionary zoning policies.,165,,
853,0.97,6761.654,6767.26,I think this report is a great conversation starter.,165,,
854,0.97,6767.26,6779.372,It is Reigniting the discussion that has long and out there.,165,,
855,0.97,6779.372,6784.177,This provides the data and direct experience from folks on the ground to show the community is echoing the call from across the country.,165,,
856,0.97,6784.177,6797.39,"It is not healthy, equitable, or sustainable . systems that we currently have have major barriers for housing choice and racial equity.",165,,
857,0.97,6797.39,6804.297,"If those are our guiding principles as the plans has, we have some work to do.",165,,
858,0.97,6804.297,6825.819,"I am excited about the upcoming conversations to take place about how we route our policies in a deeper commitment to racial equity and we look at how we address the current insufficient affordable housing, and not just affordable housing but the lack of access to housing which is applying pressure on the affordable housing units.",165,,
859,0.97,6825.819,6838.231,Councilmember Pedersen noted those are being built as fast as we can but the downward pressure is real and it is pushing people out of our city and out of their homes and into homelessness.,165,,
860,0.97,6838.231,6864.858,We will have a deep conversation throughout 2022 about the historical pattern of Exclusionary zoning and to have a conversation throughout the next year with community through the leadership of your Department about how we engage Bipoc communities in reducing displacement and increasing housing supplies.,165,,
861,0.97,6864.858,6877.07,"I also think it is really important that this report ties homes to a sense of place and economic stability, a sense of community.",165,,
862,0.97,6877.07,6896.956,"That is why I think this is a new additive report to the reports listed on slide nine because it shows how important it is for us to do this and create greater economic stability, which we can do with our zoning and housing policies of the future.",165,,
863,0.97,6896.956,6934.527,"I know this is just a point in time, but I really think this helps launch what it means to have a livable, healthy city that is affordable and a truly equitable . I look forward to working with you on evaluating our current zoning systems, making sure they are more inclusive and we have deep engagement over the next year through the plan you will present and making sure it is setting us up so we can follow through on these recommendations by our plan updates, so that is not just a little report on a shelf but we can point back to this.",165,,
864,0.97,6934.527,6935.328,Thank you very much.,165,,
865,0.97,6935.328,6940.199,"Thank you, Mr. chair, for continuing to include this on your agenda.",165,,
866,0.97,6940.199,6945.305,Thank you to Rico Quirindongo and Michael Hubner and your teams.,165,,
867,0.97,6945.305,6951.344,This is truly additive to a broader conversation for creating a better Seattle.,165,,
868,0.97,6951.344,6965.558,Very well said . Thank you for your advocacy and bringing this to us and noting the history of Mr. Maddox and his great work bringing us forward.,166,,
869,0.97,6965.558,6966.426,"Thank you, vice chair.",166,,
870,0.97,6966.426,6970.63,"Councilmember Pedersen, I see you have your how up.",166,,
871,0.97,6970.63,6974.534,"Director Rico Quirindongo, any last words?",166,,
872,0.97,6974.534,6988.381,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss, for giving us this time today to provide the report . There is so much more to talk about so we will conduct more of this conversation.",167,,
873,0.97,6988.381,6990.383,Thank you.,168,,
874,0.97,6990.383,6991.651,Have a great day.,168,,
875,0.97,6991.651,6996.556,Thanks to the staff and everybody who put this report together.,169,,
876,0.97,6996.556,7055.148,"I know one of the biggest changes that occurred recently, I was not on the Council at the time but the Affordability program, some of this information would have been helpful to have those Anti- displacement policies in place prior to implementing Nha . one of the concerns, there has been a demolition naturally occurring housing and put in its place is housing that is not affordable because the real estate developer can write a check in lieu of building units on site . I hope this helps open a discussion on how we can encourage more on-site performance of the affordable housing so it is integrated into those neighborhoods rather than a developer writing a check or having the obligation and we have to take care of it a couple of years later down the road.",169,,
877,0.97,7055.148,7057.617,It could be integrated on-site.,169,,
878,0.97,7057.617,7065.224,I am hoping this helps to open up that conversation in the program and how that is working.,169,,
879,0.97,7065.224,7065.558,Thank you.,169,,
880,0.97,7065.558,7068.961,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",170,,
881,0.97,7068.961,7076.069,For most of what was Rezoned during Nha became Lr1.,170,,
882,0.97,7076.069,7091.15,Residential small lot . This level of density does not provide enough density to create those new homes and On- site performance.,170,,
883,0.97,7091.15,7110.603,I just want to take this moment to note that we do have to have density at the scale that will be able to meet our needs and create that performance.,170,,
884,0.97,7117.043,7138.231,Maybe a better way to say this when we are talking about keeping the character of the neighborhood.,170,,
885,0.97,7138.231,7140.099,"Well said, Councilmember Pedersen.",170,,
886,0.97,7140.099,7143.536,"Colleagues, any other questions?",170,,
887,0.97,7143.536,7146.405,"Vice chair, I see you have one more.",170,,
888,0.97,7146.405,7149.842,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",171,,
889,0.97,7149.842,7151.377,This relates to economic stability.,171,,
890,0.97,7151.377,7164.924,I would be Remiss if I did not thank Andrew Houston who was in my office who had shepherded this for six months at the beginning of this year and had paid a lot of attention to housing.,171,,
891,0.97,7164.924,7196.289,"One of the points you just made is true as well for the economic stability recommendation that came from the report . It is much easier to create new small square footage for small businesses and for Bipoc owned businesses and Childcare we so desperately need if we are creating multi use and multi family structures as well . again, thank you to Andrew Houston for being in my office and bringing some of those issues up with my team as well.",171,,
892,0.97,7196.289,7198.19,Wonderful.,172,,
893,0.97,7198.19,7204.897,"If there are no further questions, we will move on to the next item.",172,,
894,0.97,7204.897,7211.804,"Thank you, Mr. Hubner . Thank you for all you have done.",172,,
895,0.97,7211.804,7214.34,This has gone a little bit longer than expected.,172,,
896,0.97,7214.34,7244.103,"Councilmember Juarez will have to be excused in about 15 minutes, so I will move to amend our agenda to bring the tree legislation before us now and then that will allow us to have more time for the report afterwards . The reason that this is important to me is I like to have bills before the committee twice before he passed them . I want to make sure Councilmember Juarez has this briefing.",172,,
897,0.97,7244.103,7244.704,Thank you.,173,,

913,0.97,7357.249,7366.158,It has been done lots of times but it is really cool on moving forward with that and getting folks involved.,179,,
914,0.97,7366.158,7366.559,Great job.,179,,

924,0.97,7423.816,7485.978,"Thank you, chairman Strauss and members of the committee for the time and opportunity to present the proposed amendment around the yes letter PIO . This is important in helping us and the community realized the Redevelopment plan for it Yesler terrace which will provide at the end of the day more than 1600 affordable homes in a vibrant mixed income and sustainable community . I will NOTE I have added a couple of slides in here based on the feedback I heard earlier at the beginning of this presentation, so I have sent those additional slides on to Noah and put into the record to provide more context for the overall Yesler development . I will talk about the plan, the proposed changes and I will dive deep into that and that the public benefits from those changes.",182,,
925,0.97,7485.978,7494.153,"At a high level, so for context, it is important to look at the overall Yesler development.",182,,

928,0.97,7512.805,7542.902,"Part of that, or a result of that was goals and principles that would decide the redevelopment of Yesler terrace . It included not only replacement of the original 561 public housing units on site at increasing the number of affordable housing to more than 850 and creating an additional approximately 800 workforce units in the neighborhood.",182,,
929,0.97,7542.902,7565.024,"There will be roughly 1200 or so market rate units once the neighborhood is fully built out .

936,0.97,7616.208,7630.422,"You know, ongoing private partnerships is a key part of how we are able to do this.",182,,
937,0.97,7630.422,7635.928,It helps us find the affordable housing and infrastructure investment neighborhood.,182,,
938,0.97,7635.928,7643.235,It is broadly known we have recently closed Kaiser Permanente to build a major medical facility.,182,,
939,0.97,7643.235,7644.636,That is just for context.,182,,
940,0.97,7644.636,7655.214,"The overall Yesler developments specifically digging into the PIO, it is --",182,,
941,0.97,7655.214,7658.817,"For the public, PIO stands for?",183,,
942,0.97,7658.817,7663.155,Planned action coordinates.,184,,
943,0.97,7663.155,7686.845,A planned action ordinance is a state planning tool that contemplates phased development and covers approximately 20 years . This is a summary of the legislative approval process or components related to the environmental impact statement we had done for the Yesler redevelopment.,184,,
944,0.97,7686.845,7690.682,Pio is one of those components.,184,,
945,0.97,7690.682,7707.399,It outlines specifically the development threshold and relative Mitigations responding to the EIS . one of those relevant Mitigations is around trees and that is what we are here to talk about today.,184,,
946,0.97,7707.399,7707.8,Okay.,185,,
947,0.97,7707.8,7708.067,Thanks.,185,,
948,0.97,7708.067,7716.108,"Within the PIO three protection plan, there are a couple of key components of that protection plan.",186,,
949,0.97,7716.108,7725.017,It is a comprehensive tree inventory and evaluation of all of the trees on site at the start of the redevelopment.,186,,
950,0.97,7725.017,7738.897,This included evaluation for a tree health by ability and compatibility with the Redevelopment plan.,186,,
951,0.97,7738.897,7750.042,"Another component of that tree protection plan was to categorize all of the trees on site as either tier 1, which was basically exceptional trees.",186,,
952,0.97,7750.042,7779.738,"I'm sorry for reading the slide here but the definition is Important. ""where preservation can clearly be achieved within the planned Street Vacation/Rededication and redevelopment plan ."" the other trees are categorized as tier 2, which are trees that are not viable in the long term due to health issues, who are in locations where disturbances during construction will make preservation Infeasible.",186,,
953,0.97,7779.738,7784.376,This includes exceptional trees in locations that are not feasible due to the redevelopment.,186,,
954,0.97,7784.376,7794.553,Mitigation for tier 2 trees is 1 -1.,186,,
955,0.97,7794.553,7804.496,So I wanted to take a second and talk about where we currently are with the tree preservation at Yesler terrace.,186,,
956,0.97,7804.496,7804.963,Let's see.,186,,
957,0.97,7804.963,7810.002,I am having a hard time reading my slides here.,186,,
958,0.97,7810.002,7816.708,We have to date reserved 46 trees out of the original 394.,186,,
959,0.97,7816.708,7826.819,We have planted 601 trees as mitigation for the removed 348 trees on site.,186,,
960,0.97,7826.819,7856.315,"Regarding the tree canopy, we have planted 391,000 square feet of tree canopy and we have removed 246 thousand square feet . that is a net increase of three Canopies . It is important to note that all Demo has been completed at Yesler and there are seven redevelopment sites in the planning stages.",186,,
961,0.97,7856.315,7866.058,"Like I said, we are currently increasing the Canopies in the neighborhood and we are not done yet.",186,,
962,0.97,7866.058,7871.263,There will be a lot more trees coming as part of that redevelopment.,186,,
963,0.97,7871.263,7890.048,"Terry, the 601 trees as mitigation for the 348, is the requirement there 1 Arkoe 1? is this mandated out right?",187,,
964,0.97,7890.048,7893.285,We have exceeded the requirement.,188,,
965,0.97,7893.285,7900.192,The difference here is we have planted many trees that we haven't counted toward the requirement.,188,,
966,0.97,7900.192,7909.101,Part of that is the replacement needs to be a similar size.,188,,
967,0.97,7909.101,7915.407,"Councilmember Lewis, please get off mute.",189,,
968,0.97,7915.407,7915.807,Thank you.,189,,
969,0.97,7915.807,7919.811,"Oh, no . I don't have any comments.",190,,
970,0.97,7919.811,7943.435,"Let me just also clarify that Yesler terrace, all of the Demo has already occurred and now what we are talking about is how are we replacing trees on the last seven redevelopment sites . is that correct?",191,,
971,0.97,7943.435,7947.839,That is correct with the exception of the trees that are at the subject of this amendment.,192,,
972,0.97,7947.839,7949.341,Okay.,193,,
973,0.97,7949.341,7949.574,Great.,193,,
974,0.97,7949.574,7950.142,Thank you.,193,,
975,0.97,7950.142,7953.745,Those are my questions.,193,,
976,0.97,7953.745,7968.16,"So digging into the proposed amendment to the four buckets of changes in the amendment, the first one is technical corrections and Clarifications.",194,,
977,0.97,7968.16,7978.337,The second is part of the Pao tree protection plan is a map and inventory of the trees on site.,194,,
978,0.97,7978.337,7990.382,The amendment will update that map to reflect existing conditions and cracked a couple of errors in the original Pao tree protection plan.,194,,
979,0.97,7990.382,8018.51,"The third component is to create an option to mitigate Off-Site if the city allows this at a citywide level . I'm sorry . This creates an option for Off-Site and if allowed, use the fee in lieu of replanting.",194,,
980,0.97,8018.51,8025.016,Currently Yesler would be precluded if the city were to enact that.,194,,
981,0.97,8025.016,8033.225,This change would make Yesler eligible for that program if the city were to pass that.,194,,
982,0.97,8033.225,8035.761,And finally--I'm sorry?,194,,
983,0.97,8035.761,8052.711,"To clarify in this point, this was based on a discussion when I took a tour of the site.",195,,
984,0.97,8052.711,8057.015,That language does not allow sha to pay a fee in lieu of unless the city has established the tree ordinance.,195,,
985,0.97,8057.015,8057.616,Is that correct?,195,,
986,0.97,8057.616,8058.417,That is correct.,196,,
987,0.97,8058.417,8059.885,I'm sorry I was not clear enough.,196,,
988,0.97,8059.885,8061.653,Thank you.,197,,
989,0.97,8061.653,8068.393,"And finally to revise, there are two tier 1 trees in block seven.",198,,
990,0.97,8068.393,8074.866,I will get into this in a little more detail on the next slide.,198,,
991,0.97,8074.866,8092.717,"To go from tier 1 to tier 2 and kind of in a reciprocal manner, there are three current tier 2 trees we are revising up to tier 1, so increasing the level of preservation.",198,,
992,0.97,8092.717,8109.835,"Can you confirm those three trees that are currently at tier 2, those could have been removed and mitigated for with a replacement.",199,,
993,0.97,8109.835,8110.402,Is that correct?,199,,
994,0.97,8110.402,8111.203,These are mature trees?,199,,
995,0.97,8111.203,8118.31,"These are mature trees that were previously categorized as tier 2 and were potentially approved for removal, yes.",200,,
996,0.97,8118.31,8125.484,And mitigated on a 1-1 basis.,200,,
997,0.97,8125.484,8125.817,Okay.,201,,
998,0.97,8125.817,8130.722,"Sorry, those three trees have been mitigated for 1-1 basis.",201,,
999,0.97,8130.722,8131.523,Is that correct?,201,,
1000,0.97,8131.523,8135.393,"Not yet, no.",202,,
1001,0.97,8135.393,8136.995,I Misheard you there.,203,,
1002,0.97,8136.995,8138.196,Thank you.,203,,
1003,0.97,8138.196,8173.565,"Digging a little deeper into the issue we were just discussing, the map on the left shows the original Pao map and location for private access drives . You will see those two dark green trees on the left side of the map . that is the tier 1 trees and the original proposed redevelopment shows those were viable trees not in the roadway.",204,,
1004,0.97,8173.565,8215.04,"On the right, we see the final Plat map . those two trees are currently in the middle of a redevelopment and aren't compatible with the Redevelopment plans for those sites . those two sites, one of them is currently under contract for development as an outpatient medical facility and the other site is currently negotiating a contract with a hospitality developer for that site.",204,,
1005,0.97,8215.04,8217.876,That tree is incompatible with the redevelopment of that site.,204,,
1006,0.97,8217.876,8218.51,Thank you.,205,,
1007,0.97,8218.51,8237.596,Here what I am seeing is that we had two trees that were dispersed with the roadway in one configuration of roadway and has been changing the configuration and we are upgrading three trees that are within growth . is that the correct understanding?,205,,
1008,0.97,8237.596,8239.03,Thank you.,206,,
1009,0.97,8239.03,8243.235,Yes.,206,,
1010,0.97,8243.235,8243.835,I'm sorry?,207,,
1011,0.97,8243.835,8246.237,Tier 1.,208,,
1012,0.97,8246.237,8256.848,Yes . The diagram on the right shows three trees that we would be upgrading that are currently under the original P.A.O.,209,,
1013,0.97,8256.848,8262.554,Designated as two tier 2 trees.,209,,
1014,0.97,8262.554,8272.33,We are proposing that we upgrade those three trees to tier 1. those to be preserved.,209,,
1015,0.97,8272.33,8272.731,Great.,210,,
1016,0.97,8272.731,8280.639,It is important to note this is a net increase in the amount of tree canopy.,211,,
1017,0.97,8280.639,8301.559,"The removed tier one or the newly created tier two trees on the left--sorry, I am not able to see my notes on this.",211,,
1018,0.97,8301.559,8305.964,"That's okay, Terry.",212,,
1019,0.97,8305.964,8320.612,"Yeah, it is a net increase of the amount of canopy for the new trees versus the ones that are downgrading to two.",213,,
1020,0.97,8320.612,8332.791,"Mitigations for this, here is the photo of the three trees we are talking about upgrading to tier 1, 74, 75, and 76.",213,,
1021,0.97,8332.791,8341.166,These trees would be in our pocket park . that would be shared by the community.,213,,
1022,0.97,8341.166,8342.4,"Thank you, Terry.",214,,
1023,0.97,8342.4,8349.107,This slide illustrates two things.,214,,
1024,0.97,8349.107,8351.443,"One I already spoke to, that the previous trees were dispersed.",214,,
1025,0.97,8351.443,8374.065,"These three create a canopy already so we are preserving more canopy, like you said . I want to note on your slide it says increase mitigation for newly designated tier 2 trees to 3:1. I wanted to thank you.",214,,
1026,0.97,8374.065,8375.934,I understand that is not in the base legislation.,214,,
1027,0.97,8375.934,8379.37,That will be part of the amendment in which I will bring forward to the next meeting.,214,,
1028,0.97,8379.37,8384.242,We can increase the mitigation occurring . I want to take this moment to thank you for working with me on that.,214,,
1029,0.97,8384.242,8390.949,Thank you.,215,,
1030,0.97,8390.949,8404.963,It is important to note that the newly created tier 1 trees that we are preserving to preserve will be in a pocket park and shared by the whole community.,216,,
1031,0.97,8404.963,8437.429,"The tier 1 trees we are downgrading to tier 2, those are currently on private property so those would not be directly accessible via the public . They would be up against the Right-Of-Way . The newly created tier 1 trees, like I said, they will be on the pocket park and adjacent to the affordable housing projects . Our next project will start later this year.",216,,
1032,0.97,8437.429,8447.739,This is a pocket park adjacent to and incorporated as part of the development by the affordable housing residents right next-door.,216,,
1033,0.97,8447.739,8463.855,"Additionally the newly created tier 1 trees will be subject to the Covenant for infrastructure, which requires a certain level of maintenance and that sort of thing.",216,,
1034,0.97,8463.855,8474.365,"The site will be maintained by the Yesler Association, which is like an Hla for the neighborhood.",216,,
1035,0.97,8474.365,8486.578,They have an Arborist under contract to maintain and ensure the health of the trees and public safety.,216,,
1036,0.97,8486.578,8497.388,"And finally, I wanted to thank you again to chairman Strauss and members of the committee and share a couple of photos of Hi Pointe.",216,,
1037,0.97,8497.388,8516.708,"You know, thinking long-term this is a neighborhood Redeveloped . These are all trees planted as part of that redevelopment and 10 years on, this is a fantastic green shaded neighborhood with canopy.",216,,
1038,0.97,8516.708,8526.918,We hope to have a similar vision for Yesler . This amendment will help achieve that.,216,,
1039,0.97,8526.918,8530.121,Thank you.,217,,
1040,0.97,8530.121,8535.727,I think this slide shows us where we are going.,217,,
1041,0.97,8535.727,8536.027,Right.,218,,
1042,0.97,8536.027,8536.394,Wonderful.,219,,
1043,0.97,8536.394,8543.701,If we can stop sharing so we can see our faces on the Channel . I see we have got some questions already.,219,,
1044,0.97,8543.701,8551.409,I just want to thank you and highlight again working on the two amendments which we will consider on July 28th.,219,,
1045,0.97,8551.409,8571.129,The first amendment will make technical corrections and the second amendment will increase the replacement requirement from the two trees being designated from tier 2 and increasing it to a 3:1 replacement.,219,,
1046,0.97,8571.129,8576.567,I am really proud we have been able to come to this agreement.,219,,
1047,0.97,8576.567,8580.672,We are increasing the amount of tree canopy at Yesler terrace.,219,,
1048,0.97,8580.672,8592.25,"With that, I will take questions from colleagues . I see Councilmember Pedersen has a question.",219,,
1049,0.97,8592.25,8593.051,Please take it away.,219,,
1050,0.97,8593.051,8594.485,Thanks to the Seattle housing authority.,220,,
1051,0.97,8594.485,8597.155,I know you are on the cutting edge of a lot of innovations.,220,,
1052,0.97,8597.155,8611.469,"I used to work at the housing and urban development years ago so I appreciate how difficult your job is and some of the good things you have done and other housing authorities in the area, like the Tacoma housing authority.",220,,
1053,0.97,8611.469,8616.975,"The Off-Site, is that just anywhere in the city?",220,,
1054,0.97,8616.975,8620.478,Correct.,221,,
1055,0.97,8620.478,8621.879,There is not prescription around that currently.,221,,
1056,0.97,8621.879,8628.319,"You had mentioned trees would be removed to accommodate, is it a hotel?",222,,
1057,0.97,8628.319,8635.093,Currently that site is the site of two development proposals.,223,,
1058,0.97,8635.093,8642.467,"One is the outpatient medical facility and the Southern half would be an extended stay hotel, yes.",223,,
1059,0.97,8642.467,8643.868,Okay.,224,,
1060,0.97,8643.868,8659.45,"The in lieu program, what if there is not an in lieu program where you can just pay a fee and not plant the tree if there is not an in lieu program?",224,,
1061,0.97,8659.45,8661.252,Are you still able to proceed?,224,,
1062,0.97,8661.252,8663.054,Yes.,225,,
1063,0.97,8663.054,8679.804,"And then if there is an in lieu program and all of those trees, the developer chose to use the program for all of those trees, would there still be a net increase in trees and canopy?",226,,
1064,0.97,8679.804,8686.878,"There is currently a net increase in trees, yes, and there will continue to be one.",227,,
1065,0.97,8686.878,8687.879,Okay.,228,,
1066,0.97,8687.879,8690.548,Thank you.,228,,
1067,0.97,8690.548,8696.454,"Councilmember Pedersen, you and I think a lot alike.",229,,
1068,0.97,8696.454,8704.562,These are the same questions I have added with additional comments.,229,,
1069,0.97,8704.562,8721.512,"When talking about Off-Site replacement, Terry correct me if I am wrong, but your plan right now is because there is a Greenbelt that is a budding property, that is what you intend to use for Off-Site.",229,,
1070,0.97,8721.512,8729.187,It is literally 10 feet difference the legal definition of being Off-Site . is that correct?,229,,
1071,0.97,8729.187,8729.921,That is correct.,230,,
1072,0.97,8729.921,8742.9,Just one clarification . There are additional properties around Yesler that we have identified as potential Off-Site areas.,230,,
1073,0.97,8742.9,8751.709,There is a property next to the hill climb which we would like to be able to use as potential mitigation sites.,230,,
1074,0.97,8751.709,8765.056,"I will say, I don't expect we are going to be utilizing that flexibility to any great extent.",230,,
1075,0.97,8765.056,8772.363,The amendment does not preclude us from affordable housing projects.,230,,
1076,0.97,8772.363,8775.666,Thank you.,231,,
1077,0.97,8775.666,8784.575,How close is this to Yesler?,231,,
1078,0.97,8784.575,8785.977,Thank you for the clarification.,232,,
1079,0.97,8785.977,8788.079,I wanted to speak to the extended stay hotel.,232,,
1080,0.97,8788.079,8823.347,"What we might not visualize here in Commttee, this is directly adjacent to Harvard view hospital, a regional hospital . The reason the extended stay hotel is important there is because this is a hospital where people from Alaska, British Columbia, Montana, Idaho, Oregon are flown into, or people who are not nearby and need a place to stay.",232,,
1081,0.97,8824.882,8829.787,"Having spent four days in the hospital myself, if my family did not live in Seattle, that would have been an extremely challenging experience.",232,,
1082,0.97,8829.787,8876.133,"While I am not typically usually, you know, very excited about hotel developments necessarily, I am more Agnostic usually, this one I think is quite important . Lastly, what I heard Councilmember Pedersen from the team and I was there on site is the in lieu fee is not something they are looking to use, even if it was passed by the tree ordinance because of their dedication to replanting trees in the area as exemplified by their net increase in tree canopy that will continue.",232,,
1083,0.97,8876.133,8880.671,I just wanted to add that color to your questions because I asked literally the same questions when I was on site.,232,,
1084,0.97,8880.671,8887.578,Are there any other questions from colleagues?,232,,
1085,0.97,8887.578,8901.192,"Seeing no further questions, we will take this up again at our next committee where we will have two amendments, a technical amendment and the increasing and replacement ratio and we look forward to having you then.",232,,
1086,0.97,8901.192,8903.194,"Rod and Terry, thanks again.",232,,

1092,0.97,8926.384,8935.126,"Well, this presentation and bill will be before us at the next meeting on July 28th.",235,,
1093,0.97,8935.126,8943.1,Moving onto our final agenda . I understand we are over time already.,236,,
1094,0.97,8943.1,8956.147,"I would ask our colleagues--I could see this taking an additional hour possibly . If there is no objection, I want to give everyone a heads up now.",236,,
1095,0.97,8956.147,8963.721,"Mr. Ong, will you please read amended item 4 into the agenda?",236,,
1096,0.97,8963.721,8979.837,Seattle Department of construction and inspections and office of Sustainability and environment quarterly tree projection report.,237,,
1097,0.97,8979.837,8980.371,Thank you.,238,,
1098,0.97,8980.371,8992.383,"As you all know, prior to my time on Council I helped write and pass 31902 which established a Workplan to get us to receiving the tree ordinance, which will strengthen tree protections.",238,,
1099,0.97,8992.383,9005.796,One of the important aspects within that resolution required quarterly reporting on progress to receive the tree ordinance.,238,,
1100,0.97,9005.796,9023.013,This quarterly reporting is not necessarily to do anything other than hold accountable departments looking to transmit this tree ordinance and so I am glad to have them again before us today.,238,,
1101,0.97,9023.013,9039.13,"What we heard from both racial equity Toolkit conversations earlier today and what we have heard about the homelessness delay in hiring a Ceo, Covid has delayed a lot of work in our city and in our region.",238,,
1102,0.97,9039.13,9042.933,This is no exception.,238,,
1103,0.97,9042.933,9057.081,Covid delayed the work longer than any of us would have liked on the tree ordinance and I want to be very clear that progress is being made and I am optimistic we will be taking up the tree ordinance in communities soon.,238,,
1104,0.97,9057.081,9060.451,I will be excited to hear the Timelines for the issuance today.,238,,
1105,0.97,9060.451,9070.961,I am excited to hear today the Timeline for that issuance.,238,,
1106,0.97,9070.961,9077.601,Today's briefing serves as an update on the work being done and an opportunity for Councilmembers to ask questions.,238,,
1107,0.97,9077.601,9095.386,"We are joined by Chanda Emery and Mike Podowski and by Patricia Bakker . I'm sure this will be the last time we say that, even though we Miss Sondra so much.",238,,
1108,0.97,9095.386,9097.855,If you would all like to introduce yourself and begin your presentation.,238,,
1109,0.97,9097.855,9098.189,Thank you.,238,,
1110,0.97,9098.189,9099.39,Good afternoon.,239,,
1111,0.97,9099.39,9104.061,"Nathan, from the Seattle Department of inspections.",239,,
1112,0.97,9104.061,9105.095,Hi.,240,,
1113,0.97,9105.095,9110.0,"I am Chanda Emery, Sdci.",240,,
1114,0.97,9110.0,9116.841,I am Patty Bacher with the office of Sustainability and environment.,241,,
1115,0.97,9116.841,9128.018,I am the new Sondra or interim urban policy advisor for Osd.,241,,
1116,0.97,9128.018,9130.521,Wonderful.,242,,
1117,0.97,9130.521,9137.661,If you would like to share your screen and take us away.,242,,
1118,0.97,9144.635,9150.107,Can Y'all see my screen in the presentation?,243,,
1119,0.97,9150.107,9155.513,"Yes, we can.",244,,
1120,0.97,9155.513,9155.913,Okay.,245,,
1121,0.97,9155.913,9157.515,"Nathan, would you like to kick us off?",245,,
1122,0.97,9157.515,9160.551,"Thank you very much, Councilmembers.",246,,
1123,0.97,9160.551,9177.268,"As you recall, city council adopted 31902 in 2019, which directed both the Seattle Department of construction and inspections and the office of Sustainability and environment to explore strategies to increase tree protections.",246,,
1124,0.97,9177.268,9195.686,The goal was to support the urban fourth Street management program while also balancing the goals to support growth and a density as provided by the city's comprehensive plan . We are happy to give you the second quarter report today on our progress.,246,,
1125,0.97,9195.686,9220.11,"Sondra in a moment we'll talk about the public outreach efforts to get to an ordinance and also some really exciting updates on the tree tracking we are doing as DCI and the next steps going forward . But first, I want to turn it over to Patty from the office of Sustainability and environment who will give an urban fourth Street management update.",246,,
1126,0.97,9220.11,9220.511,Thank you.,246,,
1127,0.97,9220.511,9238.329,"Thanks, Nathan . Yeah, I will start off with the urban management plan and I will start that off with a brief background on the plant itself and what it is.",247,,
1128,0.97,9238.329,9265.956,"It provides a framework for policy and action that guides government decision-making to help the city maintain, preserve, enhance, and restore it urban workforce . It is a set of outcomes, strategies, actions, and indicators that will provide a sustainable forest across Seattle's public and privately owned lands.",247,,
1129,0.97,9265.956,9269.26,It includes an action agenda for how the city and community partners will implement the plan.,247,,
1130,0.97,9269.26,9283.474,This agenda describes work that is ongoing within the city and also lists actions that will build on the ongoing work and will be the focus of presentation . There are 18 of these actions organized across seven different strategies.,247,,
1131,0.97,9283.474,9289.38,Six of those actions were identified as priority actions.,247,,
1132,0.97,9289.38,9297.921,There is a focus on the strategy that is described as considering first the needs of environmental justice communities in all urban fourth reactions.,247,,
1133,0.97,9297.921,9316.774,"In three of those six in the action agenda, there in this due to tree planting and maintenance in priority communities.",247,,
1134,0.97,9316.774,9320.444,The urban fourth Street core team has been working on this effort to update the plan since 2017.,247,,
1135,0.97,9320.444,9328.919,The process has included interdepartmental processes as well as extensive outreach to and engagement with community.,247,,
1136,0.97,9328.919,9333.624,A lot of work across departments and public input.,247,,
1137,0.97,9333.624,9340.531,Feedback has gone into it and it is a big accomplishment to get it to this point.,247,,
1138,0.97,9340.531,9349.306,"When you were last updated on the plan in March, we had finished the public comment period and the team had produced recommendations to incorporate public comment into the plan.",247,,
1139,0.97,9349.306,9356.613,As DCI had determined not significance.,247,,
1140,0.97,9356.613,9369.159,That public comment has been incorporated into the plan and currently the Mayor's office is reviewing the core team's recommendations to finalize the plan and provide final word.,247,,
1141,0.97,9369.159,9387.578,"As for next steps for the plan, once it is finalized, the team will be providing a briefing for Council where we will cover the plan in more detail with you and we anticipate that will be the end of the summer . It will be posted on the Website.",247,,
1142,0.97,9387.578,9399.256,A link to that can be shared with interested parties.,247,,
1143,0.97,9399.256,9407.765,The executive summary will be a printed document and it will be translated and printed in 10 languages and the work will work with the Department to distribute those copies.,247,,
1144,0.97,9407.765,9437.027,"As for progress made related to resolution 31902, I will kick off the description of the community outreach phase before cutting it over to Chanda Emery . actions related to 30912 are currently including this community outreach phase of true protection efforts.",247,,
1145,0.97,9437.027,9481.738,"There Partnering with Sdci in these efforts . The last time our team briefed you, we were set to begin public outreach and the plan at that time included utilizing a survey in order to hear from community what they are interested in related to tree regulations however after thinking through the Stakeholders, it was determined a survey would not get the detailed information we needed from specific groups . We shifted from the survey approach to a more intensive Stakeholder work . The value in this approach, it will give us that information including input from Bipoc communities.",247,,
1146,0.97,9481.738,9499.79,"We are working on a two pronged approach and we hope to get from the process and the participants not just confirmation that trees are important to you, but more details that will inform policy development in how the city protects its trees.",247,,
1147,0.97,9499.79,9564.154,"What we are looking to do is learn more about the baseline knowledge of existing tree regulations that exist within our communities and gain additional insight from various Stakeholders into how the potential changes we are exploring as identified in 31902 might impact their industry, property . for example, we will ask things like what other thoughts about creating a new option when an exceptional tree is removed and how they feel about requirements for tree service providers . by taking the time to implement outreach in this way, I believe we will get that higher-quality feedback and feedback that will help inform an ordinance that will benefit the community.",247,,
1148,0.97,9564.154,9569.059,The process is to seek input from community groups that have been historically Underrepresented and to see input from other Stakeholder groups as well.,247,,
1149,0.97,9569.059,9582.172,We are working with the Department of neighborhood and community liaison on culturally appropriate language . In order to hear from those groups that have been historically Underrepresented.,247,,
1150,0.97,9582.172,9596.086,"Community groups efforts will include Chinese, African- American, native American, Ethiopian, and people with disabilities.",247,,
1151,0.97,9596.086,9600.691,"For the other Stakeholder groups, we are conducting listening sessions with focus groups in order to hear from them.",247,,
1152,0.97,9600.691,9620.077,"They include Arborists, homebuilders, environmentalists, and real estate brokers . These sessions will be primarily in English but her disappearance can request translated if needed.",247,,
1153,0.97,9620.077,9625.315,We have been working on setting up and initiating this work since March and these sessions are getting underway now.,247,,
1154,0.97,9625.315,9636.426,We are working with nine community liaisons to reach Bipoc and other communities and we have scheduled Stakeholder group sessions.,247,,
1155,0.97,9636.426,9664.655,"Focus groups will be finished in July and the community liaisons are expected to finish their work by September . We will then synthesize the feedback received and integrate it into the development process . in the end, we are confident this information we are gathering will help us to develop strong tree protection policy that will take into effect the Bipoc communities and other Stakeholder groups.",247,,
1156,0.97,9664.655,9678.769,Our goal with the tree protections is to improve what we do and the outcomes for community and we want to do the best job reaching and Prioritizing Bipoc communities as we develop those outcomes.,247,,
1157,0.97,9678.769,9682.773,I will hand it over to Chanda Emery to discuss the efforts.,247,,
1158,0.97,9682.773,9689.88,"Thank you, Patty.",248,,
1159,0.97,9689.88,9706.363,"Today I am very pleased to share the information about the tree tracking work that our team has been undertaking per resolution 31902. just a little background on the tree tracking work, our team began tracking trees in 2019.",248,,
1160,0.97,9706.363,9721.812,"We had one analyst assigned to that work at the time and since then, this year I am very proud to say that we have Repurposed our existing resources to speed up that work because this is really essential and this is what has been missing.",248,,
1161,0.97,9721.812,9750.04,"You know, as we know we didn't have enough data to know what was happening on private property, but we did know that based on our work with the update of urban fourth management plan, the majority of the tree canopy was both on private property and in the single-family homes . What we would like to see is more trees protect did as much as possible for us and future generations.",248,,
1162,0.97,9750.04,9752.909,This is where this work comes in.,248,,
1163,0.97,9752.909,9757.781,We have heard you and we have done a lot of work on this this year.,248,,
1164,0.97,9757.781,9764.855,We have made a big investment on the project to hire staff to capture all kinds of tree data.,248,,
1165,0.97,9764.855,9805.695,"I think this data is going to lead Data-Driven policy and decision-making . We are moving forward and I just want to point that out that this work is really going to drive Data- driven decisions about policy and legislation . The reason we are collecting this data, it is really important and what we have been missing . The things we are collecting, we want to know exactly where these trees are being planted on private property, how many trees are being preserved, and how many trees are being removed . next slide please.",248,,
1166,0.97,9805.695,9809.766,"For this slide, I will share a little bit of details here.",248,,
1167,0.97,9809.766,9833.123,"The analysts on this team are using technology to collect all types of information including the permit number, the tree type, whether it is Broadleaf Evergreen or other scientific common name tree species and the diameter at standard height as measured from the ground.",248,,
1168,0.97,9833.123,9852.609,"And whether the tree was planted, preserved, removed, the location, and whether that site plan had an Arborist report, and how that permit is tied to other permits . in the next few slides, I will show you what that GIS work looks like and what the site plans look like.",248,,
1169,0.97,9852.609,9861.351,I want to point out here that this is complicated and Time- consuming work but it is super valuable.,248,,
1170,0.97,9861.351,9864.554,Next slide please.,248,,
1171,0.97,9864.554,9873.463,"Excuse me . In this first example, you will see this is a detached single-family home.",248,,
1172,0.97,9873.463,9879.436,The GIS image is on the left side.,248,,
1173,0.97,9879.436,9884.741,"On the right, third team trees are preserved.",248,,
1174,0.97,9884.741,9894.251,You can see we are using this data to figure out what is working in our current code and what isn't working.,248,,
1175,0.97,9894.251,9897.854,"From that information, we can see how we want to make changes to improve outcomes.",248,,
1176,0.97,9897.854,9902.392,Next please.,248,,
1177,0.97,9902.392,9910.7,"In this image on the left-hand side, you can see there are a few trees that are preserved.",248,,
1178,0.97,9910.7,9916.006,There is Lake Washington in the blue and a single-family home.,248,,
1179,0.97,9916.006,9921.478,There are three trees removed as indicated by the Red ask.,248,,
1180,0.97,9921.478,9924.281,12 trees have been preserved as indicated by the green triangles.,248,,
1181,0.97,9924.281,9938.328,"This project has substantial alterations and additions to a detached single-family home . As I am looking at this example, I have noticed we can do better.",248,,
1182,0.97,9938.328,9950.14,I see the proposal shows that trees were preserved but I wonder why those three trees along the roadway were removed from this project.,248,,
1183,0.97,9950.14,9986.476,"Next slide please . for this example, this development site you can see six trees were preserved as indicated by the green triangles and one tree was removed by the Red X . This is another example of a detached single-family home with the proposed backyard cottage in the Northeastern corner of this plan . in the darker shading, I think it is a little difficult to see with our videos, but it is on the northeast corner of this plan.",248,,
1184,0.97,9986.476,9994.584,"Here in this example, we can see a lot of trees were preserved but that tree on the top northeastern side was removed.",248,,
1185,0.97,9994.584,10011.868,"What I would like to see and what I want to learn from this, I want a better understanding using a scientific basis as to why the trees were protected on the bottom of this site plan, but not that tree on the top.",248,,
1186,0.97,10011.868,10016.106,"Next slide, please.",248,,
1187,0.97,10016.106,10018.041,We have been tracking trees and single-family zones.,248,,
1188,0.97,10018.041,10047.837,"The point on the map presents locations of the single-family permits from July 1ST, 2019 to April 3RD, 2020. I want to point out on this slide that this is a recent historical data that shows us we have one staff member, one GIS analyst collecting tree data for 750 permits with thousands of trees.",248,,
1189,0.97,10047.837,10072.162,"With the readjustment in our budget, I want to say that we are really Prioritizing this work and moving forward because, you know, in the next few weeks with a new team we have hired to do this work, I think we will be moving pretty quickly because with more people assigned to do this work, we can increase the number of projects that we are processing at this time.",248,,
1190,0.97,10072.162,10077.667,"Next slide, please.",248,,
1191,0.97,10077.667,10084.774,I want to point out this is our initial draft data dashboard.,248,,
1192,0.97,10084.774,10096.186,This is a Snapshot in time showing historical permit data that one GIS analyst was able to accomplish in that time frame between July of 2019 it to April of 2020.,248,,
1193,0.97,10096.186,10130.92,"I want to point out this is not representative of all trees citywide, but just a Snapshot in time with a few months worth of tree data collected by one staff member . so far we have collected data on 3978 trees on private property . This means that of those 3978 trees we have mapped with the GIS location, we know exactly where those trees are located on private property.",248,,
1194,0.97,10130.92,10136.526,There have been 1029 tree plantings and 2218 preservation.,248,,
1195,0.97,10136.526,10151.241,Each day we are adding new tree related data to GIS and each day that data set is getting larger and more complete.,248,,
1196,0.97,10151.241,10159.949,This means we anticipate we will likely have enough data processed into our system to help us shape and provide Data- driven decisions about policy nd legislation.,248,,
1197,0.97,10159.949,10163.82,This is going to be part of the foundation for us measuring outcomes as we move this project forward.,248,,
1198,0.97,10163.82,10175.365,"It is really critical . I also want you to know that this, what you see here, is a very rough draft.",248,,
1199,0.97,10175.365,10201.791,"A revised version would be much clearer and easier to interpret and easier to understand . I want to point out that this dashboard here is not statistically significant . It is just a sample . I cannot draw any conclusions at this point from the information you see in the pie chart as of yet, but we have done a lot of work on this and I feel confident we will get there.",248,,
1200,0.97,10201.791,10202.592,It just takes time.,248,,
1201,0.97,10202.592,10225.582,"Next slide, please . with additional staff on this team, we have been able to expand the scope of this project to other zones . We have been able to include environmentally critical areas into this work, which I think is really important as well as integrate the needs of other Workgroups.",248,,
1202,0.97,10225.582,10259.248,"This will help us gather more accurate data with eyes on tree removal as well as making sure this work includes trees removed and planted . One thing I want to point out, again, is prior to 2019, we had no way to track trees on private property in GIS . At that time in 2019, as of July 1ST, it was a good point in time for us to make a huge change.",248,,
1203,0.97,10259.248,10271.227,"We did a significant amount of administrative reforms that included updated educational materials, hiring certified Arborist, and conducting Trainings and other things.",248,,
1204,0.97,10271.227,10282.839,"In particular in 2019, we added our permitting system that really helped us track trees.",248,,
1205,0.97,10282.839,10296.319,"That custom button in our system showed a way to track trees with ground disturbance and that was important because before then, we didn't have that information.",248,,
1206,0.97,10296.319,10301.691,That allowed us to do things like learn ways to help strengthen the code.,248,,
1207,0.97,10301.691,10303.259,I really think that is important.,248,,
1208,0.97,10303.259,10307.797,"Next slide, please.",248,,
1209,0.97,10307.797,10318.274,"As far as next steps, Sdci is continuing to evaluate strategies as identified in the resolution through racial equity plans.",248,,
1210,0.97,10318.274,10326.916,"As Patty said earlier, this is currently underway and will run through August and September.",248,,
1211,0.97,10326.916,10333.423,We anticipate we will be prepared to issue an initial concept for analysis by the end of the year.,248,,
1212,0.97,10333.423,10338.494,"Next slide, please.",248,,
1213,0.97,10338.494,10339.429,That concludes our presentation.,248,,
1214,0.97,10339.429,10340.83,I am happy to answer any questions.,248,,
1215,0.97,10340.83,10352.108,"I just wanted to clarify that tree tracking work that we are doing, those preliminary tree numbers, those are all trees on the site plans.",249,,
1216,0.97,10352.108,10358.214,Not just exceptional trees?,249,,
1217,0.97,10358.214,10359.048,That is right.,250,,
1218,0.97,10359.048,10365.321,A further level of detail could distinguish among those trees which are exceptional and which are not.,251,,
1219,0.97,10365.321,10372.628,"Again, through our tree work, the definition of an exceptional tree is likely to change.",251,,
1220,0.97,10372.628,10373.429,"Thank you, director.",252,,
1221,0.97,10373.429,10378.668,What I heard you say is the definition of exceptional tree is likely to change.,252,,
1222,0.97,10378.668,10386.442,I appreciate very much . I would like to ask about outreach.,252,,
1223,0.97,10386.442,10390.646,I know in our meeting you have discussed you started the outreach program in January due to Covid.,252,,
1224,0.97,10390.646,10396.586,"I mean, let's just be honest here.",252,,
1225,0.97,10396.586,10407.964,In person interactions are much more effective than Online surveys.,252,,
1226,0.97,10407.964,10415.872,You were able to make that change earlier this year because of the changing guidelines regarding public health . is this correct?,252,,
1227,0.97,10415.872,10423.513,Can you give me a little deeper overview of when--let me see.,252,,
1228,0.97,10423.513,10431.888,When outreach would begin?,252,,
1229,0.97,10431.888,10436.325,"Nathan, do you want to take that one?",253,,
1230,0.97,10436.325,10439.228,I can speak to that.,254,,
1231,0.97,10439.228,10441.898,"Yeah, that is correct.",254,,
1232,0.97,10441.898,10446.736,"You know, Covid provided challenges at the beginning of the year.",254,,
1233,0.97,10446.736,10454.243,"As Patty said, you know, originally we thought a survey would be the best approach.",254,,
1234,0.97,10454.243,10468.858,We Pivoted really quickly to do the two pronged approach using focus groups . that is something we will be doing virtually this month.,254,,
1235,0.97,10468.858,10473.262,Also we are working with the Department of neighborhoods to use their community liaisons.,254,,
1236,0.97,10473.262,10481.07,I think opportunity is a really good one.,254,,
1237,0.97,10481.07,10490.246,These community liaisons will be using methods that are culturally appropriate to the audience they are serving.,254,,
1238,0.97,10490.246,10493.282,Thank you.,255,,
1239,0.97,10493.282,10499.288,Vice chair Mosqueda has a few questions to ask.,255,,
1240,0.97,10499.288,10502.792,"Councilmember Pedersen, Lewis, and myself.",255,,
1241,0.97,10502.792,10506.696,Councilmember Juarez is still here.,255,,
1242,0.97,10506.696,10513.202,"Thank you, Mr. chair . Thank you for the exciting and productive meeting today.",256,,
1243,0.97,10513.202,10519.509,"If I have to log off, I am sorry . I wanted to get these questions out there for a future conversation.",256,,
1244,0.97,10519.509,10528.818,"Given the large number of trees on right ways, how does this factor into our overall tree canopy goal?",256,,
1245,0.97,10528.818,10542.398,Are there efforts to expand maintenance of trees in the public Right-Of-Way and will that be included into future tree protection ordinances?,256,,
1246,0.97,10542.398,10545.701,I can speak to that.,257,,
1247,0.97,10545.701,10549.739,I appreciate your question.,257,,
1248,0.97,10549.739,10558.648,One of the strategies that we are exploring in resolution 31902 is the voluntary payment in lieu.,257,,
1249,0.97,10558.648,10563.953,I think that is part of this.,257,,
1250,0.97,10563.953,10571.627,There are plenty of places in the city where there is lower tree canopy and we are looking at all options.,257,,
1251,0.97,10571.627,10579.769,"Parks, neighborhoods that have historically lower tree canopy, we are looking at everything really right now.",257,,
1252,0.97,10579.769,10583.673,I appreciate that.,257,,
1253,0.97,10583.673,10585.274,I'm sorry.,258,,
1254,0.97,10585.274,10587.276,Just a follow-up question.,258,,
1255,0.97,10587.276,10600.99,So it is currently not the public right away's are currently not implemented in the current tree canopy goals?,258,,
1256,0.97,10600.99,10607.997,Would you like to answer that one?,259,,
1257,0.97,10607.997,10644.6,"Areas where tree canopy exists are certainly areas we want to make sure we can preserve as much of the existing tree canopy as we can, but in order to increase tree canopy, yes, we are looking at areas that are opportunities for planting where there is currently not tree canopy . We want to focus on areas from an environmental justice land and focus on areas that currently have low tree canopy and that includes a lot of unpaved areas, industrial areas, and things like that.",260,,
1258,0.97,10644.6,10656.612,"Yeah, we want to Prioritize areas that are currently low on canopy and increase tree canopy across the city.",260,,
1259,0.97,10656.612,10670.359,So it will in the future include trying to count and increase the number of trees on public right away's . Okay.,261,,
1260,0.97,10670.359,10681.937,Will we be able to see specifically on public right away's how our efforts to increase and maintain those trees is included in the overall goals going forward?,261,,
1261,0.97,10681.937,10683.372,Yes.,262,,
1262,0.97,10683.372,10684.34,Okay.,263,,
1263,0.97,10684.34,10686.442,Thank you.,263,,
1264,0.97,10686.442,10692.148,"I believe that is part of the effort, right, Patty?",264,,
1265,0.97,10692.148,10726.682,We are currently working on a project to do a new canopy cover assessment which was last completed in 2016 and that is every five years . I am currently gathering data and we will be completing that project for canopy cover . We will be able to do detection from 2016 to 2021 and see those areas and get data to inform have we increased or decreased canopy and where those areas are.,265,,
1266,0.97,10726.682,10753.242,"We know that replanting on site is often paying an in lieu fee . I know there are differing opinions among the public and Councilmembers about that but it is something important to consider, especially if you have a vacant lot and an exceptional tree somewhere on the lot . that cannot be avoided if you're building housing.",266,,
1267,0.97,10753.242,10761.817,We want to continue to look at the in lieu fee if a tree can be planted elsewhere on the site.,266,,
1268,0.97,10761.817,10768.924,Thank you.,267,,
1269,0.97,10768.924,10776.232,"Are there additional steps you need to be taken beyond completing the outreach, which was requested already?",268,,
1270,0.97,10776.232,10777.266,That was via that resolution.,268,,
1271,0.97,10777.266,10778.467,"Sorry, Councilmember Pedersen.",268,,
1272,0.97,10778.467,10782.938,I saw your hand too late . I will get to you next.,268,,
1273,0.97,10782.938,10795.951,"Again, the question is what additional steps beyond completing outreach which was described in resolution 31902.",268,,
1274,0.97,10795.951,10801.19,Are there additional steps you need to take beyond that outreach to be ready to issue?,268,,
1275,0.97,10801.19,10805.06,I can speak to that.,269,,
1276,0.97,10805.06,10814.203,"I don't see any additional steps . right now, like I said, we are working through our racial equity Toolkit.",269,,
1277,0.97,10814.203,10818.073,We have started that work already.,269,,
1278,0.97,10818.073,10830.052,It is kind of a document we are working through as we hear through public outreach on how people feel about existing regulations and things like that.,269,,
1279,0.97,10830.052,10840.329,"As Patty said, we will be using the tree tracking analysis to help us.",269,,
1280,0.97,10840.329,10875.231,"I think Councilmember Strauss, to further expand on that issue we don't have the proposal yet, but we can start thinking about the analysis for proposal . You know, the thought with the proposal is you look at the greatest possible impacts, recognizing city council may make further amendments but we want to make sure we cancel or capture all of that under analysis.",270,,
1281,0.97,10875.231,10875.764,Thank you.,271,,
1282,0.97,10875.764,10900.089,"What I heard you say here is outreach is concluding this month and listening sessions will conclude by September . I noticed on your presentation you said Q4, which is different than what the deputy Mayor had conveyed to us earlier in the year stating it would be Q3 in September . The Mayor's office was invited to attend today and they declined.",271,,
1283,0.97,10900.089,10909.398,I guess what confidence can I have that we will be issued to issue by September?,271,,
1284,0.97,10909.398,10918.907,"Councilmember Strauss, I know you have given us a strong mandate to get the analysis out by third quarter.",272,,
1285,0.97,10918.907,10928.984,"The Department of neighborhoods community outreach work will wrap up in September . It is a very ambitious goal, but we will do our best to meet it.",272,,
1286,0.97,10928.984,10929.918,Okay.,273,,
1287,0.97,10929.918,10971.16,"Just because really, we need to have it issued by September to stay on track and so it can inform our budget discussions to ensure that the appropriate resources are allocated to supporting the tree ordinance being passed or alternatively to make sure that we can make the appropriate budget decisions regarding the tree ordinance during this year's budget.",273,,
1288,0.97,10971.16,10976.865,"Councilmember Pedersen, I've got more questions but I realize I was hogging the microphone.",273,,
1289,0.97,10976.865,10985.24,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",274,,
1290,0.97,10985.24,10986.475,Thank you everybody for being here today.,274,,
1291,0.97,10986.475,10991.347,I want to thank the many speakers that volunteer their time to call into our meeting today to support the preservation of our trees.,274,,
1292,0.97,10991.347,11025.881,I wanted to lift up some of their comments . We had the record-breaking heat wave that scorched Seattle and reinforced health and environmental benefits of our urban tree Canopies but also laid bare the disparities that lower income households suffer when our city government continues to approve the removal of more trees especially those exceptional trees . The devastating impact of climate change are already upon us . It is important to protect the environmental infrastructure provided by Seattle's trees.,274,,
1293,0.97,11025.881,11054.51,"Yes, we want to plant trees but the reason we need to preserve existing trees, larger trees have extensive environmental health benefits including carbon and absorption of Rainwater to prevent runoff, shade for cooling during the warmer months, improved public health outcomes . We are long overdue for a strong tree ordinance to protect our urban forest.",274,,
1294,0.97,11054.51,11087.376,"Sdci has successfully done outreach and has implemented many programs in the past couple of years . The tree ordinance continues to be an Outlier so just to clarify, what I think I read in the report and heard here, will the city Department be able to deliver to the city council reposed tree ordinance before September 27th when the Mayor delivers her budget?",274,,
1295,0.97,11087.376,11099.755,Our commitment is to get work done this year and we will work with the Mayor's office to advocate to get the determination this year.,275,,
1296,0.97,11099.755,11102.458,Thank you.,276,,
1297,0.97,11102.458,11105.894,I've got no further questions.,276,,
1298,0.97,11105.894,11111.4,"Thank you, castle member Pedersen.",277,,
1299,0.97,11111.4,11122.911,I guess one other aspect I want to raise up here is the directors rule in which you transmitted to the Mayor's office in--gosh!,277,,
1300,0.97,11122.911,11126.415,Was it fall of last year?,277,,
1301,0.97,11126.415,11137.593,Sometime last year . also we will need to contain this within the work.,277,,
1302,0.97,11137.593,11149.438,One thing that is important for me to share with the public is that you have done additional work to try and move it tree protections further and faster.,277,,
1303,0.97,11149.438,11175.364,"This analysis, this work is going to do two things . one, it will create the ability to pass that role faster and put it into Rulemaking now . It will allow us to take up the tree ordinance . I just wanted to confirm is that a correct understanding?",277,,
1304,0.97,11175.364,11176.832,Do you have anything to add there?,277,,
1305,0.97,11176.832,11178.433,I appreciate you bringing up that point.,278,,
1306,0.97,11178.433,11208.931,Our Department has received tree directors role and the guidance we have been given is we do need to look at that directors role . We are planning to combine that with the proposed ordinance and the items we were contemplating in the directors role we will put directly into the ordinance.,278,,
1307,0.97,11219.141,11220.809,"Sorry, director.",279,,
1308,0.97,11220.809,11230.118,"With us running over, I had a phone call come in on the desk line which doesn't happen very frequently.",279,,
1309,0.97,11230.118,11242.931,"Again, the other thing I wanted to highlight here is your Department Repurposed its own dollars internally to move this work further and faster.",279,,
1310,0.97,11242.931,11257.145,"Councilmember Pedersen sent a really great Email earlier today and your response regarding data . We need more data, number one.",279,,
1311,0.97,11257.145,11272.06,"Number two, we wouldn't even have the data you presented if it were not for your efforts Repurpose in your own budget, so I wanted to call that out and thank you for that.",279,,
1312,0.97,11272.06,11274.062,"Had you not done that, we would be further behind.",279,,
1313,0.97,11274.062,11278.233,This will allow us to move out of the single-family zones and into all of the other zones.,279,,
1314,0.97,11278.233,11282.838,Frankly they are being more impacted at the moment.,279,,
1315,0.97,11282.838,11286.241,Anything else you would like to add there?,279,,
1316,0.97,11286.241,11294.583,"I appreciate the acknowledgment, Councilmember Strauss.",280,,
1317,0.97,11294.583,11298.687,"Councilmember Pedersen, do you have any other questions?",281,,
1318,0.97,11298.687,11301.29,I do not.,282,,
1319,0.97,11301.29,11307.562,It sounds like they need more time.,282,,
1320,0.97,11307.562,11309.197,Yes.,283,,
1321,0.97,11309.197,11325.08,It sounds like we are on track with what has been discussed at the beginning of the year to receive the issuance . I am being very clear by September.,283,,
1322,0.97,11325.08,11332.521,It sounds like the Department is working as fast as possible.,283,,
1323,0.97,11332.521,11339.494,"Colleagues, any other questions at this time?",283,,
1324,0.97,11339.494,11343.432,I know I heard Michael Ruby speak at the beginning of this meeting about 10 years in this process.,283,,
1325,0.97,11343.432,11364.453,"I am about two years into this process and in this short yet long . Mac of time, I have seen them work with urgency even though we don't have that final outcome we are so patiently waiting for.",283,,
1326,0.97,11364.453,11376.264,"With that, colleagues, if there are no further questions, we can wrap up.",283,,
1327,0.97,11376.264,11378.867,Any other further comments you would like to make today?,283,,
1328,0.97,11378.867,11383.972,"Seeing none, I would like to thank you all for coming to committee today.",283,,
1329,0.97,11383.972,11393.548,Thank you for staying with me longer than anticipated.,283,,
1330,0.97,11393.548,11395.016,This has been a long committee meeting.,283,,
1331,0.97,11395.016,11395.584,Thank you.,284,,
1332,0.97,11395.584,11398.186,"Thank you, Councilmembers.",285,,
1333,0.97,11398.186,11410.398,"This concludes the Wednesday, July 14th, 2020--2021 land use and neighborhoods meeting.",286,,
1334,0.97,11410.398,11414.903,We are adjourned.,286,,
