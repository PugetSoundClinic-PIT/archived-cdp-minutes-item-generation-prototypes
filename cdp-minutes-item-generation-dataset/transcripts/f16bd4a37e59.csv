112,0.97,878.611,894.193,"I think it might make sense to just do it now since you just briefed the letter and so what we would do is have an opportunity for people to ask questions and then sort of have that conversation, and then we would have the clerk call the roll.",29,,

122,0.97,946.912,962.828,For circulating this letter . to the Overdose emergency and innovative recovery task force . I'm absolutely happy to sign this letter in support of the demands of the Decriminalized nature movement.,32,,
123,0.97,962.895,988.654,"I want to thank all the activists of the Decriminalized nature movement, both in Seattle and nationwide who are advocating for various Psychedelic drugs like mushrooms and Cactus to be Decriminalized . Just wanted to share with members of the public that I support their demands for several reasons.",32,,
124,0.97,988.721,999.732,"First, the general reason, even for harmful and addictive drugs, data has shown just absolutely overwhelmingly that the criminal justice system is a terrible response.",32,,
125,0.97,999.798,1020.119,"We know the failed war on drugs did nothing but expand mass Incarceration, Decimating especially communities of color, and working-class communities . The Criminalization of Úpsychedelic drugs is only a small part of that mass Incarceration problem, but it is a part.",32,,
126,0.97,1020.185,1030.863,"More specifically, there is no significant research showing that these Psychedelic drugs are very harmful, sorry, really harmful, and can have very significant benefits.",32,,
127,0.97,1030.929,1070.702,"Research has shown that they can have a powerful benefit in some circumstances to treat depression and addiction . My Laypersons understanding, obviously I'm not a medical expert, but my Laypersons understanding from having talked to a couple people actually in Seattle, in fact one of them right in district 3 who has a lot of experience, and is doing a lot of research on these issues, is that we are only at the tip of what actually is probably going to be uncovered in the future in terms of correcting some of the complete misunderstandings and misconceptions about many of these issues.",32,,
128,0.97,1070.769,1095.894,"Psychedelic drugs also have a long history of religious ceremonies, which is the meaning of the word used in the letter, and in addition to supporting this letter as Councilmember Lewis mentioned, my staff and I are currently working with Council central staff in collaboration with Councilmember Lewis's of to develop legislation to Decriminalized Psychedelic drugs in Seattle.",32,,
129,0.97,1095.961,1106.238,Using the same legal approach that Seattle used to Decriminalized Cannabis shortly before it was then legalized statewide in 2012.,32,,
130,0.97,1106.305,1117.816,"Essentially Seattle has no power to Legalize these drugs because is not a city law that makes them illegal, but the city does have the power to essentially Decriminalize them by making their enforcement the last priority of the Seattle police.",32,,
131,0.97,1117.883,1122.321,"As I mentioned, this is what Seattle did with Cannabis in the passed, and that's what this proposed legislation will do.",32,,
132,0.97,1122.387,1123.155,Thank you.,32,,
133,0.97,1123.222,1127.926,Councilmember,33,,

137,0.97,1149.181,1192.991,"I have been in touch with them as well about this upcoming new task force that they are being convened, but that they decided to also advocate for this to be a component of those discussions look forward to the legislation that Councilmember Sawant just noted as well . folks, I also wanted to really highlight something that Councilmember Lewis noted in his comments, which is that this is an important emerging area of treatment for those with traumatic brain injury . When I have the briefing from the folks from Decriminalized nature they talked about how access to this types of--medicinal option, is actually very much promising for those with traumatic brain injury, including those who have suffered from severe Concussions.",34,,
138,0.97,1193.058,1198.564,"I have a very dear friend to 3 1/2 years ago suffered an incredible accident, and had an Undiagnosed concussion.",34,,
139,0.97,1198.63,1202.734,At that time.,34,,
140,0.97,1202.801,1221.42,"It has led to her not being able to keep her small business . not being able to be employed, and she is the sweetest, kindest person, and continues to be so, but needs access to treatment that is actually going to result in changes to the chemistry in her brain . hearing that, I sent the information over to her.",34,,
141,0.97,1221.486,1269.635,"She shared it with the medical provider community as well . Her response was that her doctor said this is one of the most promising areas of research that is coming forward on traumatic brain injury happy to offer some citations for folks who might be interested, but in summary, the folks from Decriminalize nature have said that no inflammation seems to be impacted in the loss of cognitive function and psychiatric disorders following a traumatic brain injury . We know that Psychedelics reduce neural information based on the Receptors they target . The, many Neurologists are beginning to explore the ways that we can put together the pieces of the puzzle, and use this important treatment . I'm going to be signing on, thank you for bringing this forward.",34,,
142,0.97,1269.701,1275.073,"I just wanted to elevate that component as a potential area of treatment for those who are suffering from the consequences of Concussions, and traumatic brain injury.",34,,
143,0.97,1275.14,1276.074,Thanks so much.,34,,
144,0.97,1276.141,1284.383,"Thank you, Mosqueda.",35,,

191,0.97,1523.722,1531.196,"Thank you, and do appreciate Councilmember Pedersen'S comments on that on the letter.",56,,
192,0.97,1531.263,1535.433,I'm happy to provide more information about the task force on some of the conversations we have been having.,56,,
193,0.97,1535.5,1551.883,"Appreciate you mentioning an interest in having this conversation, so I'm happy to follow up with you on that . moving back to my report, on the legislation that them introducing, and walking on today.",56,,
194,0.97,1551.95,1576.474,Which is Council bill 120096. today them introducing legislation amending the spending authority that this council passed earlier this year for emergency shelter . This $12 million of spending authority was originally intended to be largely reimbursed by FEMA.,56,,
195,0.97,1576.541,1587.919,"To my knowledge, the spending authority has not yet been utilized by the human services Department, although there may be some efforts that are in the planning stages to utilize some of that money.",56,,
196,0.97,1587.986,1596.394,"But, what this legislation really hope to do is broaden the conditions under which this $12 million in spending authority can be distributed to service providers.",56,,
197,0.97,1596.461,1600.432,This does not mean the executive Department should not continue to seek FEMA reimbursement.,56,,
198,0.97,1600.498,1608.373,But in no longer makes seeking that reimbursement a strict requirement to distribute the funds.,56,,
199,0.97,1608.44,1613.645,There are two reasons to make this change and broaden this authority.,56,,
200,0.97,1613.712,1625.023,"First, we have more resources at our disposal then when the bill was originally passed . for example, we know next year the city will be receiving Arpa dollars in the spring.",56,,
201,0.97,1625.09,1639.838,"We know that 2021 city revenues will be $40 million higher than we originally anticipated, and we did not have the fortune of that revenue forecast at the time we originally Crafted the bill.",56,,
202,0.97,1639.904,1651.85,We now have the benefit of a $10 million state insurance fund that representative Macri Crafted in the last legislative session.,56,,
203,0.97,1651.916,1655.887,Specifically designed to compensate cities in the event that FEMA reimbursements come up short.,56,,
204,0.97,1655.954,1663.428,"These new factors give the city more leeway to respond to the greatest emergency we are facing, which is the crisis of homelessness.",56,,
205,0.97,1663.495,1673.171,"The second reason, is as of June 30th, we are anticipating a broad reopening of cl's economy.",56,,
206,0.97,1673.238,1677.442,We only get the chance to reopen our economy once.,56,,
207,0.97,1677.509,1737.969,"Without a doubt, one of the biggest obstacles that I hear, from folks, in the service sector, and in the business community, is the presence of Unsanctioned Encampments . We have a legacy over the course of Covid of our already scant shelter system being hit, and our neighbors are experiencing homelessness, no longer having that resource for access to, shelters that use to provide the critical dignity, privacy, and services necessary to mitigate or escape their condition of homelessness . by the same token, people who used to take advantage of that shelter system that has now been De-Intensified, and was never really successfully scaled back up to compensate for that last--lack of capacity, are now living in Unsanctioned Encampments . which have created issues for our business districts across the city.",56,,
208,0.97,1738.036,1743.274,There is one response that can help take care of everybody's issue.,56,,
209,0.97,1743.341,1759.491,"Whether you are not housed, whether you are a small business owner, which is to scale up the amount of emergency shelter we have available to compensate for the lack of capacity in our shelter system.",56,,
210,0.97,1759.557,1815.947,"I hear that this is one of the biggest obstacles when I talk to people in the business community, for our return to work and revival of tourism . I've also heard from our service providers that during Covid, irreparable damage has been caused to a lot of our neighbors experiencing homelessness who have high barrier public health needs and have been living without care for support now for the last 18 months in a lot of cases . We have seen throughout the pandemic several examples of successful interventions that have been able to adapt to these conditions, and move our neighbors experiencing homelessness into well Resourced enhanced shelters, particularly hotel based ones . resulting in public spaces no longer being utilized for Encampments, and resulting in people in some cases, being able to move into market rate housing, let alone permanent supportive housing, because of the assistance that they have received from these enhanced shelters.",56,,
211,0.97,1816.014,1840.338,"We heard a presentation from just care in the select community on homelessness strategies and investments last month, indicating that very few individuals had refused offers of assistance to their efforts to get people inside, and that they are getting their needs met, and in many cases, have moved on to the placements that I just discussed.",56,,
212,0.97,1840.405,1844.209,"This model works, and we need to lean into it.",56,,
213,0.97,1844.275,1852.317,"The clock is ticking down, thousands of our neighbors remain without shelter other than a tent or sleeping bag in the doorway.",56,,
214,0.97,1852.383,1865.33,"We know that well Resourced shelters like tiny House villages and hotels can stabilize people with a high barrier public health challenge that can also, in some cases, lead to public safety challenges.",56,,
215,0.97,1865.396,1872.637,"We also know that if we fail to provide that service, removing an encampment will simply create another encampment somewhere else.",56,,
216,0.97,1872.704,1892.957,"And will move the hazards that our neighbors experiencing homelessness experience themselves, but also the hazards that are business districts trying to reopen are constantly complaining about to our our offices to the Mayor's office, and every public official in the city.",56,,
217,0.97,1893.024,1902.066,We cannot seek to solve the problem of one of these business districts merely to create another one for someone else.,56,,
218,0.97,1902.133,1911.843,"All Stakeholders need to acknowledge that our interests are the same, that providing did nearly Stabilization and Healthcare is really fundamentally this comes down to Healthcare.",56,,
219,0.97,1911.909,1920.985,Is the same interest as wanting to restore business districts order for reopening.,56,,
220,0.97,1921.052,1934.365,"That interest require standing up adequate shelter on a truly emergency basis, and doing it for the summer of reopening . tiny houses are slow, because they need to be cited and go through extensive Preplanning and be constructed, but we have some in the pipeline.",56,,
221,0.97,1934.432,1940.672,"Enhanced shelters similarly need to be cited and held out, but hotels are fast.",56,,
222,0.97,1940.738,1955.086,They are Turnkey operations . they don't require Siting . they don't require the same level planning and construction . They require a lease and a plan from a service provider.,56,,
223,0.97,1955.153,1963.828,"This is what we should be leaning into before the end of this month to reopen downtown and our other business districts, in a way that will make a good first impression for the return to work, and the return of tourism.",56,,
224,0.97,1963.895,1971.502,"I know for a fact, that we have providers that can secure hotels if they had cash in hand . The spend authority can be used immediately.",56,,
225,0.97,1971.569,1979.477,"We must use it immediately . Many of our shelter assets in the pipeline are coming Online later this summer, or even in the fall.",56,,
226,0.97,1979.544,1983.748,We need places for people to be able to go now.,56,,
227,0.97,1983.815,1985.216,"This month, before the economy reopens.",56,,
228,0.97,1985.283,1990.221,We are running this through the full council.,56,,
229,0.97,1990.288,1993.091,I hope to vote this out of Council on the 14th.,56,,
230,0.97,1993.157,1996.728,Commensurate with the emergency we are facing.,56,,
231,0.97,1996.794,2006.704,"I want to thank Council President Gonzalez, Councilmember Mosqueda, and Councilmember Morales for their cosponsor of this critical legislation.",56,,
232,0.97,2006.771,2009.741,I'm happy to answer any questions about it over the course of the next week.,56,,
233,0.97,2009.807,2038.403,"Just to pivot to my last item that I'm really happy to announce . I want to express my really, really deep appreciation and congratulations to Jessica DOE, who has been a graduate student intern in my office for almost my entire Council term so far . that means Jessica, you have basically spent two thirds of your time at the Evans school working in our office.",56,,

There are no items on the full council agenda from the community economic development committee.",59,,
247,0.97,2138.369,2140.571,"Last week in my Committee, we heard 16 Commission appointments.",59,,

252,0.97,2179.41,2184.415,"So, invite everybody to participate in that if you are available.",59,,
253,0.97,2184.482,2187.084,On this afternoon's full council agenda we have two bills to consider.,59,,
254,0.97,2187.151,2197.428,"Council bill 120077, the sound at home Eviction defense for Renters who are facing financial help during this pandemic.",59,,
255,0.97,2197.495,2201.899,Council bill 120090.,59,,
256,0.97,2201.966,2211.642,"Right of first refusal, that I'm joint sponsoring with Councilmember Sawant and Councilmember Lewis is a cosponsor.",59,,
257,0.97,2211.709,2216.514,"That bill has several proposed amendments that are being brought by my office, and Councilmember Sawant, these are all technical in nature.",59,,
258,0.97,2216.581,2223.421,Really meant to clarify the intent of the bill.,59,,
259,0.97,2223.487,2227.358,We have someone here this morning to provide information about those amendments and answer any questions colleagues may have.,59,,
260,0.97,2227.425,2231.362,"So, I'll keep my remarks brief, and reserved most of my remarks for this afternoon.",59,,
261,0.97,2231.429,2251.649,"I do want to acknowledge that many of us have had conversations over the last few weeks with small landlords . My office has had a few conversations with folks, and we know that, like thousands of Renters in the city, some landlords have lost their income during Covid.",59,,
262,0.97,2251.716,2260.825,"So, these bills, I just want to say are meant to protect Renters from losing their homes . They are not meant to put landlords in jeopardy of also losing their homes.",59,,
263,0.97,2260.891,2274.405,That's why I want to urge these landlords to take advantage of the rental assistance dollars that both the city and the county have made available . The County has an Eviction prevention and rental assistance program.,59,,
264,0.97,2274.472,2289.253,"It is funded at $145 million from the Federal Coronavirus response and relief supplemental appropriation . It is intended to help residents paying passed, current, and future rent.",59,,
265,0.97,2289.32,2293.09,Seattle also has about $20 million available in rental assistance.,59,,
266,0.97,2293.157,2305.136,"So, do want to urge Renters, or landlords, before they consider an Eviction response, I want to urge them to take advantage of these dollars so that they can be made whole.",59,,
267,0.97,2305.202,2308.939,That's what they are therefore . I'm also happy to cosponsor Council bill 120096.,59,,
268,0.97,2309.006,2311.776,Which Councilmember Lewis has summarized already.,59,,
269,0.97,2311.842,2323.554,My office has worked directly with just care and really seen how effective this program is . We talked with neighbors who seen Co-Lead and just care in action.,59,,
270,0.97,2323.621,2335.366,"As Councilmember Lewis said, the bottom line here is that these programs have universal support from small business, service providers, our house neighbors, and our Un-Housed neighbors.",59,,
271,0.97,2335.433,2338.202,And many on the Council.,59,,
272,0.97,2338.269,2352.016,"Folks who want to see Un-Housed Pople moved from the street and towards stability need to take a look at this program and understand the value that it has, and the real comprehensive support that it provides to people.",59,,
273,0.97,2352.083,2392.623,"This is what we mean by finding an effective and comprehensive way to address homelessness . So, I look forward to supporting that and hope that we can really move that forward . moving onto Department updates . The art Department, if you haven't been in the Chinatown International district, you should go and check out the Nero that was installed last weekend along the Maynard Alleyway . across the South King street . These are images of painted noodles that were created by an artist.",59,,
274,0.97,2392.69,2402.366,"It's a combination of engagement with the Chinatown International district communities, to Reimagine Maynard alley as a vibrant community focused pedestrian space.",59,,
275,0.97,2402.433,2420.05,"I will say throughout Chinatown's throughout the country, the alleyways have always played an important role in community space as well . This is just an opportunity to highlight that and really try to get some of the alleyways back to active spaces.",59,,
276,0.97,2420.117,2424.522,The project was funded through the Seattle office of arts and culture.,59,,
277,0.97,2424.588,2429.193,And with the Department of transportation's 1% for our program.,59,,
278,0.97,2429.26,2438.335,"I do want to thank the Northwest agent League for high- Fiving this project another art project, the AIDS Memorial Pathway installation up and Capitol Hill have begun.",59,,
279,0.97,2438.402,2457.388,"I want to encourage my colleagues to take a look . If you take the light rail up to the capital stop, as you emerge from underground, you will see the installation called we are already here . It's a series of Tableaux that use protest signs and their accompanying messages, like dream big, end AIDS.",59,,
280,0.97,2457.454,2463.26,To invoke historic moments of public convergence.,59,,
281,0.97,2463.327,2476.941,"Different Artworks lead visitors through pathways at the AIDS Memorial Walkway, and are really a powerful message . I encourage everybody to go check it out.",59,,
282,0.97,2477.007,2501.932,"As we know, and as Councilmember Herbold highlighted last week, the creative economy itself drives about 18% of Seattle'S GDP . The majority of workers in our city, and there is close to 70,000, 67,000 creative workers, who we know are running low on reserves.",59,,
283,0.97,2501.999,2504.368,Many of them were very hard-hit by Covid.,59,,
284,0.97,2504.435,2507.538,They don't have enough cash on hand.,59,,
285,0.97,2507.605,2510.441,The organizations.,59,,
286,0.97,2510.507,2512.91,To cover some of their operating expenses for the next year.,59,,
287,0.97,2512.977,2528.659,"So, as we move forward with discussions about Arpa funds, we need to make sure that we are addressing the role of the arts sector in our economy, and ensure that we are including them in our rescue plan efforts . I know we will be talking more about that later.",59,,

359,0.97,3353.683,3358.488,So at least $30 million would go to a strategic investment fund.,61,,
360,0.97,3358.555,3360.924,Specifically to address displacement and Gentrification consents.,61,,
361,0.97,3360.99,3376.372,"Recognizing that when we have public land it should be going to the highest public use .

412,0.97,3867.797,3872.001,I think those--that concludes my remarks.,64,,

415,0.97,3877.74,3880.943,"Short and sweet, so much, Councilmember Pedersen.",66,,
416,0.97,3881.01,3885.581,Any comments or questions for Councilmember Pedersen?,66,,
417,0.97,3885.648,3889.452,"Hearing none, we'll ahead and go down the line and hear from Councilmember Sawant next.",67,,
418,0.97,3889.518,3892.288,"Thank you, and everyone.",68,,
419,0.97,3892.355,3925.621,"First, I also am happy to add myself as cosponsor to Councilmember Lewis' ordinance . Council B120096, to support making hotel rooms available for the just care program to make a safe and humane place for our homeless neighbors . It is outrageous that the Mayor has done nothing with the available FEMA resources for the last year while thousands of our community members throughout Seattle were forced to find whatever shelter they can find in parks and at the sides of the roads.",68,,
420,0.97,3925.688,3955.484,"I also noticed that when the Mayor's office announced the Rfp for the strategic investment fund, her office totally ignored the fact that she had cut the $30 million from the budget until the Council restored those $30 million in the budget amendment proposed by my office and the people's budget movement . that explained at the time the Mayor sat on the $30 million for all of 2020, refusing to let it be used to build housing and community centers.",68,,
421,0.97,3955.551,3965.795,Despite getting numerous requests from nonprofit affordable housing providers like Lehigh and others.,68,,
422,0.97,3965.861,3981.877,"We warned during the last budget that it was essential that the city council restore the $30 million, otherwise the Mayor can continue to issue press releases announcing funds for affordable housing and for community colors which are never actually used.",68,,
423,0.97,3981.944,3999.762,"The Amazon tax, on upholding the Amazon tax, is a huge victory for thousands of ordinary people, activists, union members and socialists who actively fought in the tax Amazon movement.",68,,
424,0.97,3999.829,4004.834,The tax Amazon movement won a historic victory last year during the height of the nationwide black lives matter protests.,68,,
425,0.97,4004.9,4017.012,This movement has been fighting since the autumn of 2017 when our people's budget movement at the time did a very successful overnight peaceful occupation of city hall.,68,,
426,0.97,4017.079,4023.119,"Against the Sweeps of our homeless neighbors, and we connected that to the fight for the Amazon tax.",68,,
427,0.97,4023.185,4041.804,"In fact it was at that time that the movement started calling it the Amazon tax . We, as activists, and my office included, got a shameful repeal by the city council at the time of the Amazon tax which we had won at that time.",68,,
428,0.97,4041.871,4047.676,"It laid the groundwork, the work that activists had done at that time laid the groundwork for eventually winning the Amazon tax last year.",68,,
429,0.97,4047.743,4055.017,"Last summer, after the historic victory that we had in the 2019 elections.",68,,
430,0.97,4055.084,4080.176,"Just like in the case of the fight for the $15 minimum wage in Seattle, the most critical reason why the city's big business establishment and political elite were forced to concern the tax Amazon movement was a very successful ballad initiative text.",68,,
431,0.97,4080.242,4096.058,"You have it straight from the horse's mouth, the big business who themselves were fiercely opposed to both $15 an hour and Amazon tax themselves, publicly admitted that had it not been for the credible threat of the ballot initiative, they would not have relented on having a city council measure on both the $15 an hour and the Amazon tax.",68,,
432,0.97,4096.125,4103.566,"In fact, the tax Amazon movement collected a total of 30,000 signatures on the ballot initiative.",68,,
433,0.97,4103.632,4141.17,"20,000 of those 30,000 signatures were collected at the Blm protests in Seattle at the rate of 1000 signatures a day . There was such overwhelming support at the black lives matter protests for the Amazon tax because people understood that is the same system that creates the deep oppression, the mass Incarceration system, police violence, racism, that also deprives some of the very same communities of affordable housing and the For-Profit housing market that has led to such intense Gentrification and displacement.",68,,
434,0.97,4141.237,4144.206,Of working-class communities of color.,68,,
435,0.97,4144.273,4146.208,Or working-class communities as a whole.,68,,
436,0.97,4146.275,4160.623,"I wanted to congratulate everybody who signed the ballot initiative petition and also everybody who fought in the movement, all the thousands of people who attended our mass action conferences.",68,,
437,0.97,4160.689,4180.142,"Which was a shining example of a democratically organized mass movement, and in fact the most democratically organized movement that I've personally been a part of where thousands of people had a chance to weigh in on the key elements of the political debate and discussion, and then all of us together voted on it.",68,,
438,0.97,4180.209,4189.485,I think that example should be carried forward in order to build on Renters' rights victories.,68,,
439,0.97,4189.552,4214.343,"Many of the bills are coming today, but we have much more to them, including rent control and canceling of Covid that . There are three items on today's city council agenda related to those Renters' rights issues that were voted out of the Sustainability and Renters rights Committee on May 25th . Council bill 120046 is the legislation from my office banning the Eviction of schoolchildren, their families and educators during the school year.",68,,
440,0.97,4214.41,4232.728,"As I've said before, it is common sense, but there is mountains of research showing that when kids are evicted it has devastating impact on their academic achievements and development.",68,,
441,0.97,4232.795,4248.177,"It's really, as many have said, many educators and parents have said to us, just imagine trying to focus on your schoolwork as a child, while losing your home . I read those statistic many times, so I'll skip over them for now, but also just mentioned that we know that Statistics also show a very important dimension of the crisis.",68,,
442,0.97,4248.243,4253.849,Which is that it is a racial justice and black lives matter issue.,68,,
443,0.97,4253.916,4260.556,"Overall, we see that Seattle landlords evicted black tenants at much higher rates than other tenants.",68,,
444,0.97,4260.623,4265.16,"Similarly, even on this specific issue, we see that black students and other students of color disproportionately faced homelessness.",68,,
445,0.97,4265.227,4290.019,"The 2018 state data from the fully 40% of homeless students were black, and 23% of homeless students were Latinx, even though those communities contribute only 14 and 12% respectively Fcl'S public school students population . preventing school year innovations will reduce at least this one form of systemic racism.",68,,
446,0.97,4290.085,4335.464,"That is affecting our students and I really appreciate the overwhelmingly strong support that we have received from the Seattle education Association, whose representative assembly voted with near unanimous support for a revolution in support of this legislation . I also strongly appreciate the letter that was jointly sent by them and by the Martin Luther King County labor Council in strong support of this bill, and rejecting any loopholes that would water the bill down . This the kind of advocacy that we need from the labor movement, and the leader leadership and I wanted to thank them all for playing this important role in helping to push this forward.",68,,
447,0.97,4335.531,4354.183,"We've seen the reality of Eviction and housing instability, not only affects education and learning of young children, it also affects their mental health and social outcomes.",68,,
448,0.97,4354.249,4373.302,"Even related to lower vocabulary skills, problem behaviors, not to mention of course grade retention and also being connected to increased high school dropout rates . Then, he follows them throughout their life with the lower adult educational attainment.",68,,
449,0.97,4373.368,4396.792,"We can see the deep connection between housing instability and overall well-being in life . We also know that research shows turnover in school staff significantly harms the school's effectiveness in educating children that is why our bill is a very strong bill, which also offers school year protections to all staff in public schools, on public school campuses.",68,,
450,0.97,4396.859,4411.907,"Last week, central staff set you all a technical amendment to this legislation adding a Severability clause which we have discussed in consultation with Council President Gonzalez's office.",68,,
451,0.97,4411.974,4427.756,"We support that amendment . Last Tuesday, in city council briefing, I appealed to all Council offices to send out any amendment in advance so Renters have the opportunity to review them.",68,,
452,0.97,4427.823,4434.596,That Renters can let Councilmembers know how they would be affected by potential amendments.,68,,
453,0.97,4434.663,4448.877,I appreciate a conversation that Councilmember Mosqueda and I had about an amendment that she is trying to bring forward that she shared that we should draft out with the Council offices.,68,,
454,0.97,4448.944,4452.748,"As I let her know, it will add a small loophole to the hole, which I don't support.",68,,
455,0.97,4452.815,4456.985,Of course I can explain my reasoning once heard amendment has been described.,68,,
456,0.97,4457.052,4462.891,So far I have not seen any other amendments.,68,,
457,0.97,4462.958,4467.362,"Either that means that they're going to be last-minute loopholes proposed, or there are not going to be any amendments.",68,,
458,0.97,4467.429,4470.999,I know Councilmember Pedersen has proposed four amendment that would have watered down the bill.,68,,
459,0.97,4471.066,4475.07,In a way that I would completely not support.,68,,
460,0.97,4475.137,4477.506,"Thankfully, none of those amendments were passed by the committee.",68,,
461,0.97,4477.573,4488.884,"Of course, amendments can come up in the full council meeting as well, so I would appreciate some advanced notice of those amendments.",68,,
462,0.97,4488.951,4494.756,"I appreciate, as I said, the organization of the Seattle education Association.",68,,
463,0.97,4494.823,4505.534,"I also want to recognize the school board director who originally suggested this legislation to the city Council and sat to the city council a letter last night that read in part, quote, preventing Evictions prevents, and home residents.",68,,
464,0.97,4505.601,4511.64,Preventing Evictions of those connected to school can focus on school.,68,,
465,0.97,4511.707,4515.477,"The similar law has survived legal challenges in San Francisco, Seattle is stronger and better.",68,,
466,0.97,4515.544,4524.019,Imagine for a moment a school student end was to be evicted on a day like today.,68,,
467,0.97,4524.086,4529.458,"Immediately dramatic, but even worse, if the student needs to be able to focus at school tomorrow.",68,,
468,0.97,4529.524,4530.525,They won't be able to.,68,,
469,0.97,4530.592,4538.433,"Too much stress and pain . please support the smart policy . Thanks for your participation and thank you for your service, end quote.",68,,
470,0.97,4538.5,4545.54,"Also in today's agenda, is the Council bill 120090.",68,,
471,0.97,4545.607,4556.318,Which is a legislation jointly sponsored from Councilmember Morales' office in my office . and cosponsored by Councilmember Lewis.,68,,
472,0.97,4556.385,4563.625,Creating a right of first refusal for Renters to renew their lease unless the landlord has a just cause for refusing to renew the lease.,68,,
473,0.97,4563.692,4574.102,"This issue has been discussed by the committee, the Sustainability and Renters rights committee since March . The committee heard from two panels of impacted Renters and Renter rights experts.",68,,
474,0.97,4574.169,4589.418,It discussed previous legislation that were developed by Councilmember Morales' office and by my office.,68,,
475,0.97,4589.484,4597.759,"Through those discussions and technical feedback, it became clear that what Renters really need in the situation is a right of first refusal where a landlord is required to get the current tenant the first chance to sign a new lease.",68,,
476,0.97,4597.826,4605.067,Before offering that lease to any other prospective tenants unless there is a just cause . We know Renters need a new lease long before they face Eviction.,68,,
477,0.97,4605.133,4614.71,Directors who are told they will not have their lease renewed will refuse to leave just because Seattle's losses that cannot be in that situation.,68,,
478,0.97,4614.776,4629.658,"In real life we know Renters would start looking for a new place to live, even though they may--even be aware that it's unjust and they understandably simply don't feel competent to potentially have to fight it out in court.",68,,
479,0.97,4629.725,4634.73,And course of discussing our bill in committee we heard from dozens of Renters who called in during public comment.,68,,
480,0.97,4634.796,4653.615,"Everyone who testified at the committee table itself I want read the full statement, but I wanted to thank all of them . One is a Starbucks worker and Trans activist also another couple who are both public school educators and member of the Seattle's education Commission.",68,,
481,0.97,4653.682,4680.008,"Our new bill puts the right of first refusal into the part of the Seattle's law that the Seattle Department of construction and inspection have the power to enforce . It means that the landlord does not offer a new lease, it does not have a just cause, 90 days before the end of the lease, they have the power to Follow- up, investigate, tell the landlord that the either need to offer a new lease or present a just cause not to.",68,,
482,0.97,4680.075,4700.729,They can issue a citation or a notice of violation and start issuing fines if a landlord refuses to follow the law . all of this can happen before the lease and so Ideally these issues can be resolved in the Renter can get a new lease without anyone going to Eviction court.,68,,
483,0.97,4700.796,4706.435,My office also had the opportunity to discuss with several landlords who desks that assist.,68,,
484,0.97,4706.501,4712.707,Some even signed our community petitions.,68,,
485,0.97,4712.774,4726.321,"In fact, Renters and union members who are part of our study for an overall Renters' bill of rights are fighting to cancel Covid that.",68,,
486,0.97,4726.388,4739.334,"It is faced by Renters and also struggling homeowners, struggling small landlords and struggling small businesses . We believe that big banks and corporate real estate, along with big business as a whole, should pay for the crisis, not working people and others who are struggling in our community to survive.",68,,
487,0.97,4739.401,4749.878,Including struggling small landlords and small business . Some of the landlords at my office talked to a post this legislation.,68,,
488,0.97,4749.945,4760.856,"One made an argument against this legislation that I would like to respond to public . He said some Renters are a quote Unquote headache, and the end of the lease is a convenient time to get rid of them.",68,,
489,0.97,4760.922,4767.562,Over the last five years or more my office has supported many Renters and groups of Renters facing abuse from their landlord.,68,,
490,0.97,4767.629,4776.471,"When I hear that some Renters were a headache, I had to ask what does that actually mean? this legislation allows landlords to refuse to renew a lease if they have a just cause.",68,,
491,0.97,4776.538,4783.211,"By law, there are just causes that the landlord can use if that's actually true.",68,,
492,0.97,4783.278,4789.718,"So, the legislation is consistent with the existing law.",68,,
493,0.97,4789.784,4797.626,Landlords can refuse to renew a lease if they have a just cause to refuse to do so.,68,,
494,0.97,4797.692,4808.803,"There is a clear law as what counts as a just cause, not some so-called headache, which is not actually documented in the law.",68,,
495,0.97,4808.87,4832.36,"If a Renter reports a landlord to the Seattle Department of construction and inspections for housing code violations or for violating Renters rights, that might be a headache for the landlord, but is not a just cause to kick out the Renter . It is the Renter'S right to complain about those things . This is not a hypothetical example that I just used . over the years my office has spoken to many Renters whose landlords have RETALIATED against them for reporting housing code violations.",68,,
496,0.97,4832.427,4843.338,My office also spoke to two representatives from Windermere property management who object to being called a big corporate landlord.,68,,
497,0.97,4843.405,4872.767,"To be precise, they do not own buildings, they are property management corporation managing over 1000 rental housing units . from the perspective Renters, as spoken to people, Renters are really in a position to make a distinction between building owner and the property management company because to them, they are the landlord . I'm happy to make this clarification so that it does not distract from the main point that big business use small landlords as a fig leaf to a prose basically Benny of the progressive Renters rights bills that we have brought forward.",68,,
498,0.97,4872.834,4879.474,"Last week, Councilmember Morales and my office presented amendments clarifying the language.",68,,
499,0.97,4879.541,4887.415,They are attached to the agenda and none of them make any substances changes.,68,,
500,0.97,4887.482,4909.337,"Also on today's city council agenda is Council bill 120077, the legislation Councilmember Morales's office, which I welcomed and I have cosponsored as committee chair to create a defense against Davidson for Renters facing rental that's during Covid emergency that was described earlier.",68,,
501,0.97,4909.404,4919.514,"Finally, but not least, in today's city council Agendas resolution 31998 which is a resolution for my office urging the Mayor and the governor to extend the Eviction Moratorium'S through the end of the year.",68,,
502,0.97,4919.581,4931.059,Councilmembers will remember that this resolution last came for a vote on March 13th . two weeks before the city and state Eviction moratorium's were set to expire.,68,,
503,0.97,4931.126,4938.199,"Minutes before this meeting where the resolution would have been voted on, Mayor Durkan relented to the community pressure and extended the moratorium for another six months.",68,,
504,0.97,4938.266,4939.834,"I'm sorry, three months.",68,,
505,0.97,4939.901,4941.236,Later the governor also did the same.,68,,
506,0.97,4941.303,4950.578,"In response to my proposed, and the Council unanimously agreed, to delay their vote on the resolution until today, June 7th.",68,,
507,0.97,4950.645,4953.415,The moratoriums are not projected to expire on June 30th.,68,,
508,0.97,4953.481,4958.086,Which would be a real disaster for Renters.,68,,
509,0.97,4958.153,4971.299,"According to the U.S. Census Bureau's household survey, 270,000 Washington state Renters have little to no confidence that they will be able to pay rent next month, which is 18% of all state Renters.",68,,
510,0.97,4971.366,4996.891,"98,000 Washington state Renters think it is very, or somewhat, likely that they will be evicted in the next two months . We have fought for and won the right to counsel for Renters facing Eviction, rental assistance money, all of those are extremely important, but none of them are an excuse to fail to extend the Eviction moratorium.",68,,
511,0.97,4996.958,5003.198,"When the Eviction moratorium ends, literally thousands of Seattle Renters could be served with Eviction paperwork, known as unlawful retainer.",68,,
512,0.97,5003.264,5017.612,"This is not speculation, this has been confirmed nationwide through economic projections . An unknown number will set the date, meaning that they will move before they are even formally served with Eviction paperwork.",68,,
513,0.97,5017.679,5030.392,I appreciate the Mlk labor Council and 46 other organizations are sent a joint letter in March urging the Mayor and the governor to extend the moratorium to the end of this year.,68,,
514,0.97,5030.458,5041.369,Precisely for this reason . that we don't even have proper data on how many Renters will end up self Evicting.,68,,
515,0.97,5041.436,5047.709,"Statistically half of those actually served with formal Eviction paperwork will be evicted by default, because they're unable to respond to the paperwork or appear in court.",68,,
516,0.97,5047.776,5060.255,"Only those who make it to their and hearing can potentially avoid efficient using CLO's Eviction defense, right to counsel and rental assistance funds.",68,,
517,0.97,5060.321,5062.557,I oppose Eviction because housing should be a human right.,68,,
518,0.97,5062.624,5094.189,"At the very least however, this housing emergency that Renters are facing due to the economic shock of Covid 19 and the rear collapse in their financial conversation, that they Expensed over the last year need to be resolved before elected officials even consider lifting the Eviction moratorium . two weeks ago my office sent all Councilmember offices amendment language to update that resolution to account for the changes over the passed few months.",68,,
519,0.97,5094.255,5112.273,"Hopefully Councilmembers have had the chance to look at that . The amendment has up-to-date statistics and also language on recent community organization including important quotes, without just mentioned, I won't read from the Washington community action network . also from the Washington low income housing alliance.",68,,
520,0.97,5112.34,5118.98,Both the organizations are advocating for the extending of the moratorium to the end of this year.,68,,
521,0.97,5119.047,5125.119,I really hope that the city council will vote yes on this amendment.,68,,
522,0.97,5125.186,5139.267,The amendment also accounts for the amendment resolution also accounts for the Senate bill 5160 that shamefully ends the statewide moratorium on June 30th.,68,,
523,0.97,5139.334,5153.481,"To be clear, while the statewide moratorium is scheduled to end on June 30th, according to that bill, there is nothing legally stopping governor Inslee from issuing a new proclamation Reenacting the Eviction moratorium, and the legislation says nothing about the city's moratorium.",68,,
524,0.97,5153.548,5170.298,"The amendment language is fully consistent with the issues .

566,0.97,5504.999,5508.169,I also do have a possible amendment that a Markdown right now.,74,,
567,0.97,5508.236,5514.242,We are in conversation with Councilmember Sawant and the central staff team that is on the line here as well.,74,,
568,0.97,5514.308,5525.219,I did send you a draft of the amendment over massaging a little bit so make sure we can address one of the issues we have heard about the underlying bill.,74,,
569,0.97,5525.286,5545.339,Related to the school year . My office has been working closely to try to understand some of the potential unintended impacts of the housing instability that may come up in very rare situations where there is a homeowner who does not have a large amount of wealth.,74,,
570,0.97,5545.406,5556.083,"Has financial limitations or other life circumstances that necessitate them to move back into their homes, but potentially during this 10 month period.",74,,
571,0.97,5556.15,5586.514,I did circulate an amendment that I'm considering and will make sure to share with you all any changes well before the meeting this afternoon to get at the one concern that I think has come up that has Resonated with me and I want to see if we can try and address it through this ordinance without creating any additional changes to this Subtext of the legislation . There is a handful of folks who have written about wanting to have it carefully Crafted amendment that applies specifically to owner moving . as an exemption in the school year.,74,,
572,0.97,5586.58,5588.616,Evictions moratorium.,74,,
573,0.97,5588.683,5607.501,I want to note that this is owner move INS is an exemption that is exactly modeled off the language in the just cause statute that this council passed in previous years . with the support of advocates and tenant rights folks in that period.,74,,
574,0.97,5607.568,5616.877,"So, the language that we are potentially look at including is from the just cause ordinance that lists owner move INS as a just reason for Eviction.",74,,
575,0.97,5616.944,5629.423,"This is not a Lee pole, as are lots of reasons why an owner may need to move into their home, including life changes like the birth of a child . loss of a job, illness or disability.",74,,
576,0.97,5629.49,5630.057,Or relocation needs.,74,,
577,0.97,5630.124,5651.779,"In these very few cases, it is expected that an owner is going to have to wait up to 10 months to move in, or could, if they have additional housing instability, that this could could eventually cause housing instability for those specific folks that have a rental unit that they would need to move back into.",74,,
578,0.97,5651.846,5663.19,"In this effort to make sure that we are not creating additional hardship or housing instability for that specific small landlord, we are trying to look at modeling the language exactly from the just cause statute to make sure that we are not creating additional housing instability.",74,,
579,0.97,5663.257,5685.012,"I want to underscore the importance of great instability for families, especially those with Kiddos during this time . So, this amendment would add a owner move in exemption for owners to give 90 days notice prior to the move as in the just cause legislation to make Sre that if they move, that this is their principal residence.",74,,
580,0.97,5685.079,5688.816,We don't want people moving in and then not staying there and not having it as their principal residence.,74,,
581,0.97,5688.883,5690.785,They actually have to live there.,74,,
582,0.97,5690.851,5704.799,This narrow amendment is intended to be in response to some of the concerns we've received about the potential impact of housing instability for few of the low income or income restricted small landlord's with just one single residence.,74,,
583,0.97,5704.865,5726.253,"That they rent and are dependent upon that rental unit for their own family to be able to move into potentially if they are facing hardship due to Ciel's high housing costs, there are a few circumstances where an owner of the residence may not have the financial means to lineup another housing option or to wait for the length of time required in this legislation.",74,,
584,0.97,5726.32,5744.605,"In some circumstances, families would need to wait for them to move in and that would create additional hardship one example is the correspondence that we had related to one owner and their small children who had been living with other family members and have since welcomed a baby.",74,,
585,0.97,5744.672,5762.456,"They had always wanted and intended to move back into their home and do not have the means to pay for both their mortgage and an additional spot or take on additional debt in housing under this legislation and it is currently written, in the circumstance, these owners would have to wait until the year is up.",74,,
586,0.97,5762.523,5778.506,What we are trying to find his language from the just cause ordinance that is already in place to apply in this situation so that if there is owner move in's that are allowed in just cause that we can apply it to the situation where then it would be a just reason for ending the Month-To- month rental agreement.,74,,
587,0.97,5778.572,5787.448,I do want to note that Councilmember Morales and Councilmember Sawant right of first refusal legislation also has all this also up for a vote this afternoon.,74,,
588,0.97,5787.515,5801.262,"Which I'm very supportive of, also includes that all leases automatically convert to Month- To-Month under this situation . their father just cause ordinance protections would allow all these leases.",74,,
589,0.97,5801.328,5819.547,"Regarding the school year, again I want to say how important this legislation is . how much I support the folks who have been writing in in support of this legislation, and I just want to see if there is a way to pair the language that we have from the just cause ordinance with this piece of legislation in front of us to make sure that we are creating housing stability for all.",74,,
590,0.97,5819.613,5830.858,Especially those who are income limited and may have a Life- changing circumstance that necessitates them to move back into their rental unit.,74,,
591,0.97,5830.925,5852.446,"Also requires--what we are looking at with the support and direction of Councilmember Sawant is Ideally finding ways to strengthen the requirements, especially recognizing that there are clear reasons.",74,,
592,0.97,5852.513,5855.115,There has to be a justification to use the movie and language here.,74,,
593,0.97,5855.182,5867.094,We are very concerned that they may be concerned that folks use it inappropriately.,74,,
594,0.97,5867.161,5872.566,"To try to address that, we are looking at possible triple damages that would go back to the Renter if somebody inappropriately uses this small narrow caveat.",74,,
595,0.97,5872.633,5890.851,"I think that's just a note to the overall need for us to strengthen the just cause move in, owner move in language overall, which I'm very much committed to doing, but wanted to see if the in this narrow situation there might be support for that.",74,,
596,0.97,5890.918,5913.007,"Again, thanks to Councilmember Sawant for my initial language, and looking forward to seeing if we can strengthen this component with a very important note that we have more work to do on over move in language overall to make sure it is being appropriately applied . I think it could potentially help here especially some of the stories we have heard from folks who really are meeting these hardship requirements and do need to potentially move back in.",74,,
597,0.97,5913.073,5917.011,"So, that's that.",74,,
598,0.97,5917.077,5921.882,Okay.,75,,
599,0.97,5921.949,5931.258,"Councilmember Mosqueda, I think you specifically requested Council central staff be on the line today to describe your amendment.",75,,
600,0.97,5931.325,5946.907,I'm going to ask you to Queue up that opportunity for--I think you specifically asked . I'm going to Queue you up to sort of have him explain any other aspects of the amendment that you would like him to.,75,,

603,0.97,5959.987,5992.586,"As we've been trying to find a narrow solution to the issue that has come up for the specific circumstances that a homeowner may find themselves in that they need to move back in . Jeff has offered some language that has been circulated and is working with us on the possibility of strengthening the damages so that there is true enforcement that could be built upon in this language . Jeff, did you want to offer any clarification, or you are welcome to also show the language that you have provided to me if that's helpful to folks.",76,,
604,0.97,5992.653,5994.822,Happy to have you walk through and offer clarification.,76,,
605,0.97,5994.888,5996.657,Sure.,77,,

617,0.97,6045.072,6050.511,"As was circulated already to all the Councilmembers, if you look at what would be subparagraph 10 be.",81,,
618,0.97,6050.577,6064.291,In the school year Eviction moratorium there is just a sample reference that is added . 22 606--subsection.,81,,
619,0.97,6064.358,6075.903,"All ready as noted as I previously noted in some materials provided, lays out the fuse times where the school year Eviction moratorium would not apply as a Eviction.",81,,

621,0.97,6087.748,6095.189,"If there has been criminal activity on the part of the tenant, or an operation of an unlawful business.",81,,
622,0.97,6095.255,6098.425,"So, adding that small additional piece, just adds to this.",81,,
623,0.97,6098.492,6109.803,"If the landlord was looking to move into the unit for their own occupation, or their immediate family member, that would be permitted.",81,,
624,0.97,6109.87,6112.406,That is the piece that has Ardie been seen by all Councilmembers.,81,,
625,0.97,6112.473,6120.981,"The language that we are working to develop, that is not yet final, would also refer back to the just cause Eviction ordinance.",81,,

627,0.97,6123.884,6148.408,"Noting that in subsection B, if the conditions result in the tenant being removed or vacating, were not meant, the tenant could pursue a private action for either $2000 or three times the rent that have been charged to the tenant, whichever was greater, and any fees associated.",81,,
628,0.97,6148.475,6155.949,Either the suit or arbitration . that language is still being finalized so I won't share it at this time.,81,,
