31,0.97,107.874,113.847,"The next meeting of the committee is scheduled for a special time this Thursday, July 15th at 2:00 P.M.",21,,
32,0.97,113.847,129.462,"In Thursday's meeting, we will discuss with a community panel of Renters and Renter right advocates and staff members about the three Renters rights bill from my office that we began discussing last week.",21,,
33,0.97,129.462,138.805,The first bill requires landlords to provide six months notice for any rent increases.,21,,
34,0.97,138.805,147.38,"Currently in Seattle, only two months notice is required.",21,,
35,0.97,147.38,149.849,This was originally requested by the city of Seattle Renters Commission.,21,,
36,0.97,149.849,156.656,The next bill requires landlords to provide relocation assistance when they are displaced due to rent increases.,21,,
37,0.97,156.656,159.926,It has become to be known as economic Evictions.,21,,
38,0.97,159.926,174.741,"Over the past decade, there has been Gentrification of our neighborhoods primarily driven by skyrocketing rent forcing Housings from their homes, neighborhoods, and ultimately the city.",21,,
39,0.97,174.741,178.211,Many actually into homelessness.,21,,
40,0.97,178.211,192.058,"According to nationally recognized studies, every $100 increase in rent in the city, or in any region result in a 15% increase in homelessness.",21,,
41,0.97,192.058,199.566,The connection between the increase in rent and increase in homelessness is staggering.,21,,
42,0.97,199.566,230.396,"In Seattle, Renters were displaced by redevelopment are eligible for relocation assistance through the ordinance . Renters who are first to move by outrageous rent increases who faced exactly the same burdens of displacement get nothing . The bill from my office, the economic displacement relocation assistance ordinance makes Renters eligible for assistance when they are forced to move by a rent increase of 10% or more.",21,,
43,0.97,230.396,245.878,"At the same time, Renters cannot simply sit back and accept that Washington state's Democrats and Republicans will manage control for the next 40 years.",21,,
44,0.97,245.878,251.217,It has already been banned for the previous 40 years and we have seen the consequences of this not only in Seattle but statewide with skyrocketing rent.,21,,
45,0.97,251.217,269.269,"That is why my office is proposing number offensive rent control to limit rent increases to no more than the rate of inflation with none of the corporate loopholes, like vacancy to be used to undermine the effectiveness of rent control policies across the country.",21,,
46,0.97,269.269,275.942,The rent control legislation from my office has what is called a conditional effective date.,21,,
47,0.97,275.942,283.85,Goes into effect the moment Washington state lift the ban on rent control.,21,,
48,0.97,283.85,295.895,"Ween over the past 40 years, state lawmakers have ignored the fact they are standing in the way of Renters rights that can stop displacement alongside a massive expansion statewide of publicly owned affordable housing.",21,,
49,0.97,295.895,318.184,"If this Council Pounces the legislation, lawmakers will be under tremendous pressure to ignore the issue and repeal the ban . I urge committee members of the city Council to please come prepared and to ask questions about the two bills.",21,,
50,0.97,318.184,322.255,This will be the second meeting where these bills will be discussed and we want these discussions to be productive.,21,,
51,0.97,322.255,350.483,"One after the fact of making them productive is for community members to come prepared with comments . As I mentioned, the city of Seattle Renters Commission wrote a public letter to propose the six months notice bill and they also took a vote to support the economic Evictions with this assistance bill.",21,,
52,0.97,350.483,366.899,"Thursday's meeting will also here and vote on the appointment of four more from the oversight board . After these four appointments, the board will have four more to make, one appointed by the Mayor and three appointed by the board members themselves.",21,,
53,0.97,366.899,373.239,The appointment will be the only voting item on Thursday's agenda.,21,,
54,0.97,373.239,397.83,"As many of you know, about a year ago I stood at an Amazon press conference outside Baptist church with a dozen clergy and community activists and Socialists to demand the establishment support the central area housing plan which has been developed by Reverend Jeffrey and other area black clergy.",21,,
55,0.97,397.83,412.178,"As a result of this advocacy and advocacy of hundreds of community members, we won an amendment in the final bill to dedicate a portion of the Amazon tax each year to affordable housing.",21,,
56,0.97,412.178,415.081,This was an important accomplishment and victory for the black lives matter movement.,21,,
57,0.97,415.081,418.518,We need far more affordable housing in the central district and citywide.,21,,
58,0.97,418.518,439.405,"Over the years, my office has spoken with many faith leaders that are eager to build affordable housing on their properties and as part of this movement, they understand the urgency and mandate for more affordable housing.",21,,
59,0.97,439.405,445.511,Reverend Jeffrey and other black members of the clergy and explained how 50 years ago the Democratic party establishment at that time essentially forced the church to sell its land.,21,,
60,0.97,445.511,468.1,"The selling price under the threat of taking it to eminent domain was $34,000 . This was a travesty against the church community and against the black working class . and also the city's working class as a whole with the loss of affordable housing it represented.",21,,
61,0.97,468.1,475.541,"That land today is worth more than $2 million, more than 8 times the inflated selling price from 50 years ago.",21,,
62,0.97,475.541,493.659,At least part of that property can and should be developed into affordable housing . the church and partnership with a low income housing Institute has developed a plan to build affordable housing for 87 households on the city's stolen property with community preference for those that were displaced from the central district.,21,,
63,0.97,493.659,508.875,Outrageously the office of housing is going to be planning to offer only $20 million of funding for low income housing in the fall no funding ability.,21,,
64,0.97,508.875,520.486,"That is the first step in the technical process the city uses to fund affordable housing projects, like the one proposed by Reverend Jeffrey and other black clergy.",21,,
65,0.97,520.486,535.201,"After it is issued, project bid and some are selected appeared only then does the affordable housing start to be built.",21,,
66,0.97,535.201,539.405,Ultimately they do not need to make a payment for well over a year.,21,,
67,0.97,539.405,547.48,"At that point, the Amazon tax funds should be available.",21,,
68,0.97,547.48,556.055,"The only reason it would not be available as if the Mayor refused to honor the promise of the Amazon tax, which of course would be totally unacceptable.",21,,
69,0.97,556.055,576.809,"My office is committed alongside Lehigh and the black clergy to increase the funding for Anti-Gentrification, affordable housing projects, and Councilmembers have seen% Ãšthe Email exchange between the members and my office, which all of you are copied on.",21,,
70,0.97,576.809,599.332,"Working with a wide range of community members and black lives matter and Palestinian rights activists, my office is taking steps to advance legislation that would ban the Seattle police Department from engaging in training with Nationstates found to violate human rights.",21,,
71,0.97,599.332,617.45,"Last week I circulated the draft legislation to other Councilmembers inviting your feedback and asking you to contact my office if you wish to cosponsor this legislation, which I hope to be introduced sharply alongside the organizations and Progressive labor unions that are part of this struggle.",21,,
72,0.97,617.45,640.906,Our legislation would ban Seattle police from training or having any exchange with the military or police of any nation violating the conventions of the United Nations or the bill of human rights which together form the basic humanitarian standards that need to be adhered to and have been internationally agreed upon by Nationstates over the last 70+ years.,21,,
73,0.97,640.906,664.697,"This follows city council resolutions . Obviously this is in accordance to the revolutions that were passed with these international standards, committed to uphold civil rights . In fact, not passing this legislation would contradict these resolutions and Long-Standing city policy.",21,,
74,0.97,664.697,670.202,Some of the opponents of the legislation have claimed this ordinance unjustly singled out the state of Israel.,21,,
75,0.97,670.202,673.239,It does not.,21,,
76,0.97,673.239,677.109,I urge Councilmembers and your staff to read the bill properly.,21,,
77,0.97,677.109,692.925,The bill bans training with the military or police of any nation state it has been found to violate these basic International human rights standards.,21,,
78,0.97,692.925,705.538,"Obviously needlessly to say, the ban would apply to the Seattle police Department engaging in training with these state forces with the Seattle police Department.",21,,
79,0.97,705.538,720.352,"These are the state forces who have been responsible for Brutalizing the Palestinian people for decades and who have been wrongly condemned worldwide by unions, faith communities, human rights groups, and governments this past spring for their brutal and disproportionate military assault on the people of Gaza.",21,,
80,0.97,720.352,749.415,Their attempted instigation of a violence . The Israeli state has been found over the years by organizations like amnesty International and Israeli mainstream human rights organizations to have repeatedly violated the Geneva conventions of the United Nations and its aggressive attacks on Palestinians and the forced seizure of their lands.,21,,
81,0.97,749.415,755.921,The International Court of justice has found the Israeli state violated the fourth Geneva convention rights of Palestinians.,21,,
82,0.97,755.921,776.208,The human rights Council repeatedly has determined the Israeli state violated International human and civil rights laws and committed war crimes against the Palestinians . in January the Israeli human rights groups detailed systemic human and political rights violations by the Israeli state in their report.,21,,
83,0.97,776.208,793.259,"As a matter of fact, this ordinance applies across the board and there are other Nationstates that violate such basic International human rights laws as the Geneva conventions, Seattle police will be banned from training with them also.",21,,
84,0.97,793.259,806.305,"Last week, my office circulated in the community a petition calling on this police training an of human rights Violators and the response was remarkable . Within 48 hours, more than 800 community members had signed.",21,,
85,0.97,806.305,822.755,"Earlier this morning, my staff had circulated a petition to all Council offices so you can look at not only the signatures but the number of comments that have come in, which I really appreciate members of the public offering these comments.",21,,
86,0.97,822.755,838.237,"Just a few of them, a union member of the International order of masters made some pilots and a central district resident wrote, quote, Violators have no place in our community.",21,,
87,0.97,838.237,841.407,Is Seattle a police state city?,21,,
88,0.97,841.407,844.877,Were a city with standards and justice?,21,,
89,0.97,844.877,845.177,End quote.,21,,
90,0.97,845.177,858.924,"Daniel from district five wrote, quote, we need to move away from violence and allow SPD to train his the complete opposite direction.",21,,
91,0.97,858.924,873.138,"We should invest money to indigenous residents, not to teach other Stouts . 775 from the University district wrote these kinds of tactics are inexcusable.",21,,
92,0.97,873.138,876.742,Police are already too Militarized.,21,,
93,0.97,876.742,882.047,They have aggressive tactics.,21,,
94,0.97,882.047,893.025,"Christian, a member of the International Association of aerospace workers wrote simply our community is not a war zone.",21,,
95,0.97,893.025,904.97,"The increasing levels of Militarization of our police force have been ongoing Post- 9/11 and have only going to endanger our people and create fear, mistrust, and anger with the very people we are supposed to trust.",21,,
96,0.97,904.97,916.382,Violators have committed Heinous crimes . There is no logical reason why anyone in this country should receive help from a nation who blatantly DENIES such things.,21,,
97,0.97,916.382,922.288,This is another blaring look.,21,,
98,0.97,922.288,932.398,"Seattle Councilmembers must stand up and let their voices reflect those . There is power and democracy . If they can lead in any way, they must.",21,,
99,0.97,932.398,964.897,"I urge Councilmembers to read the comments by more than 300 signers that they have added comments and contact my office if you wish to cosponsor the bill . last week during the city council briefing, I talked about the legislation from my office and introduction to the Council President's office a few weeks ago about various Psychedelics, like magic mushrooms and Mdma . last week at the briefing, I raised questions for Councilmember Herbold who was not there.",21,,
100,0.97,964.897,971.203,I will raise the questions again now so we can have discussion on this.,21,,
101,0.97,971.203,976.508,I have publicly been reporting on this legislation for over three weeks at reported city council briefings.,21,,
102,0.97,976.508,987.219,"On June 25th, my office drafted to Herbold's office.",21,,
103,0.97,987.219,999.865,"We said we would assume this would be referred to your public safety committee given the subject matter, however if you do not have the capacity in your Comittee meetings, please let us know and we will find another committee option.",21,,
104,0.97,999.865,1001.467,"Alex, I try to give you a call.",21,,
105,0.97,1001.467,1004.77,Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.,21,,
106,0.97,1004.77,1009.441,That was in there from my staff member.,21,,
107,0.97,1009.441,1025.657,"Since then, my staff have also followed up with literally dozens of phone calls, but we have not received any response from Councilmember Herbold's office on whether they will accept this into their committee or not.",21,,
108,0.97,1025.657,1029.928,"If they don't want to accept, I am happy to accept the legislation in my Committee, as I have said repeatedly.",21,,
109,0.97,1029.928,1031.563,I wanted to pose the question here publicly.,21,,
110,0.97,1031.563,1042.107,We met last week with Decriminalized nature activists and they are frustrated with the unnecessary delay.,21,,
111,0.97,1042.107,1063.629,"As I have said, I am flexible on what committee this is referred to but I am concerned by the already now nearly 3 week dealing interruption and I am perplexed that Councilmembers have not provided any public Oxygenation for why they are refusing to allow the bill to be introduced.",21,,
112,0.97,1063.629,1064.997,It is no longer a controversial point.,21,,
113,0.97,1064.997,1079.344,"There is research on how damaging the war on drugs has been for decades and this is coming on the heels of all of that well-established research and we are talking about Psychedelic drugs, which have a powerful potential to be used in the treatment of Ptsd, depression, and addiction.",21,,
114,0.97,1079.344,1086.151,Some have little or no harmful effects.,21,,
115,0.97,1086.151,1097.563,"We know the harmful effects are almost always a result of other drugs, like Methamphetamine being placed in without the knowledge of the consumer.",21,,
116,0.97,1097.563,1121.053,"In Canada, there are incredibly successful programs . There is a testing tent set up were members of the public can bring their drugs to see if what they are about to consume is what they think they are about to consume or if it is laced with something harmful.",21,,
117,0.97,1121.053,1132.498,This alone has saved many lives but this program only works because people are willing to use it and people are only willing to use it because they know that it will not be used to arrest them regardless of the legality of their drug in their possession.,21,,
118,0.97,1132.498,1144.943,That is the research that has shown the Causality from not Criminalizing the drugs to actually having safe consumption and reduced consumption of the dangerous drugs.,21,,
119,0.97,1144.943,1160.492,"My point, of course, even if the drugs can be harmful, some of them can be harmful and we are aware of that, and the criminal justice system has a terrible response that has been documented to the point of consensus among the scientific community.",21,,
120,0.97,1160.492,1171.537,It prevents harm reduction approach that saves lives . It has been part of the failed war on drugs that has Massively expanded mass Incarceration.,21,,
121,0.97,1171.537,1180.846,"Only a small part of that mass Incarceration system, but they are part of it.",21,,
122,0.97,1180.846,1187.553,"Once the legislation is placed on the introduction before calendar, and makes it available to the public to see and comment on.",21,,
123,0.97,1187.553,1223.088,"That should happen with no further delay . I also joined other Councilmembers in signing the new Overdose emergency recovery task force asking them to review this issue, but I don't believe there is any scientific evidence to show that should be used as a reason to prevent anyone else from weighing in and prevent introduction of this bill . Some of the members of the task force our activists, whom I have spoken with personally last week.",21,,
124,0.97,1223.088,1231.863,"They don't see any reason why there should be a delay in interviews, saying they are particularly concerned with the delays at this point.",21,,
125,0.97,1231.863,1256.822,"There are not many meetings before the budget begins . If this is not done as soon as possible, it'll be delayed until after the budget, which often means it will not be taken up this year because Councilmembers get busy with the budget and effectively we would need to start all over again next year and that is simply not fair to the activists of Seattle and the members of the public who want this past.",21,,
126,0.97,1256.822,1267.466,"As I said, I am happy to discuss further but I don't agree that there should be any further delay in introduction of the bill and I hope Councilmembers will not block the introduction.",21,,
127,0.97,1267.466,1287.052,"Finally, but not least, I want to thank members for their work alongside our office in aggregating for full funding for their project to renovate, improve, and add art and historical displays in the heart of Seattle's central district.",21,,
128,0.97,1287.052,1289.554,This project started 15 years ago and it is time to finish it.,21,,
129,0.97,1289.554,1301.933,"This Melds the original plan's vision with culturally relevant art installations, improved access, play equipment, and an improved Restroom facility.",21,,
130,0.97,1301.933,1320.852,"We know the Garfield area will be a gym in the central district . I will be adding three funds of $500,000 into the project and I urge Councilmembers to support this.",21,,
131,0.97,1320.852,1325.09,I am excited to join community members this Wednesday at 5:00 P.M.,21,,
132,0.97,1325.09,1331.663,To celebrate the project's progress.,21,,
133,0.97,1331.663,1331.997,Thank you.,21,,
134,0.97,1331.997,1333.665,Thank you so much for that report.,22,,
135,0.97,1333.665,1341.006,Are there any Council comments or questions on Councilmember Sawant's report?,22,,
136,0.97,1341.006,1345.777,I wanted to comment on the bill.,23,,
137,0.97,1345.777,1352.718,"Just as a little bit of background, the bill was only made available on Wednesday, June 30th.",23,,
138,0.97,1352.718,1401.032,"I don't want to get into the whole issue of calls made . I don't have a way of knowing how many calls were made, but my staff has received four Voicemails and three of them on this topic . When I responded in Councilmember Sawant's office a couple of weeks ago when they informed us this bill was coming, I let them know I would be meeting with Decriminalized nature to talk about their ideas about process and the content of the bill . We subsequently, myself and Councilmember Lewis, subsequently attended one of their board meetings.",23,,
139,0.97,1401.032,1408.573,It took them some time to consider conversation that we had and get back to us.,23,,
140,0.97,1408.573,1415.68,We all have an Email from them in our Inbox this morning.,23,,
141,0.97,1415.68,1423.789,"Again, to clarify, they have not assigned the bill to a committee yet.",23,,
142,0.97,1423.789,1451.216,"Council President Gonzalez has, and I will let Council President Gonzalez speak for herself, but the understanding is we all have agreed, the Council, asking that the recovery task force recommended a process for considering this policy.",23,,
143,0.97,1451.216,1464.596,I believe referring the bill to the committee prior to recommendations from that Committee is premature . The legislation is not right.,23,,
144,0.97,1464.596,1477.809,I appreciate that the Council President is supporting the position we have all taken regarding that policy.,23,,
145,0.97,1477.809,1496.294,"Just to clarify, the word of it Decriminalized nature of Seattle Emailed this weekend for their support of the task force and waiting for their recommendations.",23,,
146,0.97,1496.294,1500.365,There are several members of Decriminalized nature Seattle on the task force itself.,23,,
147,0.97,1500.365,1512.544,"Again, there are concerns that introduction of this legislation would indicate a specific intent prior to receiving recommendations.",23,,
148,0.97,1512.544,1544.776,"There is a strong support on the Council for recognizing the usefulness in public health context and interest in the policy objectives of the legislation, but again, I am really hoping that we can consider policy at a time when we have actually received recommendations from the folks who are looking at this issue.",23,,
149,0.97,1544.776,1547.612,Thank you.,23,,
150,0.97,1547.612,1557.556,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold . sorry, it took me a second to find the on mute button.",24,,
151,0.97,1557.556,1559.557,Any other questions or comments for Councilmember Sawant?,24,,
152,0.97,1559.557,1575.907,I just find this response to the question of phone calls and Voicemails somewhat Disingenuous.,25,,
153,0.97,1575.907,1582.847,"Yes, it is true that my staff member did not leave a voicemail on every call he made, but he made 23 calls.",25,,
154,0.97,1582.847,1585.85,He probably left four Voicemails.,25,,
155,0.97,1585.85,1598.263,"You are right, Councilmember Herbold . It would be completely crazy for him to leave 23 Voicemails . Nobody in their right mind would do that.",25,,
156,0.97,1598.263,1600.465,Four Voicemails should be ample for staff members.,25,,
157,0.97,1600.465,1604.97,"You know, it is your office.",25,,
158,0.97,1604.97,1608.873,"Ultimately it is not about staff members, it is about the office as a whole.",25,,
159,0.97,1608.873,1611.843,We care about this issue and we are looking for a response.,25,,
160,0.97,1611.843,1621.252,I appreciate you have spoken openly today but this is the response we were seeking when we reached out to your office so many times.,25,,
161,0.97,1621.252,1635.4,"Leaving that aside, on the question about what the letter that all of us signed says, there was no comment about a process for the letter.",25,,
162,0.97,1635.4,1637.969,The letter did not say one word about that process.,25,,
163,0.97,1637.969,1646.211,"Maybe some of you were thinking that was the process that you were agreeing to when that letter was signed, but that is not what it actually says.",25,,
164,0.97,1646.211,1691.122,"Yes, I did mention myself just a few minutes ago that members--some of the members of the task force and also activists in it Decriminalized nature Seattle, they have informed me they believe the research and the scientific conclusions to be so well-established at this point that they don't expect the work of the task force is going to change the substance of the legislation in any way and they, themselves, are perplexed and frustrated as to why there has been a delay in introduction.",25,,
165,0.97,1691.122,1694.159,The letter does not say the task force should finish prior to producing this bill.,25,,
166,0.97,1694.159,1707.238,I do not agree that the legislation is right here introduction of legislation is the first step to allow for Democratic debate.,25,,
167,0.97,1707.238,1708.173,Okay.,26,,
168,0.97,1708.173,1728.46,"Are there any other comments or questions for Councilmember Sawant's support? I'm sure we will have this discussion all over again at 2:00, so we will have an opportunity to discuss it there.",26,,
169,0.97,1728.46,1738.803,"I do want to say that as Council President, it is my responsibility to identify which committee this proposed legislation would go to.",26,,
170,0.97,1738.803,1743.308,"In this instance, I do believe it is appropriate to refer this legislation to the public safety and human resource committee.",26,,
171,0.97,1743.308,1764.429,My hope was that Councilmember Herbold and Sawant could come to an agreement . I have heard very strongly from a Councilmember Herbold as the chair of the public safety committee that she would like for the task force process to run its course prior to introduction related to this particular subject.,26,,
172,0.97,1764.429,1772.237,I am deferring to her as the chair and supporting her decision in terms of that particular Timeline.,26,,
173,0.97,1772.237,1788.62,Obviously Councilmember Sawant has the right as a Councilmember to make an amendment to the referral calendar to introduce her proposed legislation in advance of the task force . My understanding is that is likely going to happen this afternoon at 2:00.,26,,
174,0.97,1788.62,1812.377,"If it does, folks will have to make a decision on whether or not they agree with the chair of the public safety committee and my support of that decision and support or not support Councilmember Sawant's notion to amend the calendar.",26,,
175,0.97,1812.377,1816.781,"That being said, let's go ahead and move down the line, unless we have any other questions or comments.",26,,
176,0.97,1816.781,1823.288,"Hearing none, Councilmember Strauss, good morning.",26,,

202,0.97,1997.628,2026.057,"A couple of other things I want to mention . As we all know, last week the office of police accountability released its report about the presence of police officers in Washington, D.C. on January 6th . They found complaints against two officers to be sustained . I believe the recommendations of the discipline committee to terminate two officers for violation of law were found to be necessary.",29,,
203,0.97,2026.057,2051.616,"I recently stated noting my belief that if employees knowingly travel to a location in support of people whom they knew were tempting an insurrection, even if their participation was as an observer, that is a clear connection between conduct and duties or responsibilities and I believe it is an offense that merits termination.",29,,
204,0.97,2051.616,2095.326,"The word clear connection between conduct and duties or responsibilities is a reference to the SPD policy manual that specifically States that the Department does not want to unduly limit the liberties or rights of officers, but clarifies when there is a clear connection between conduct and duties or responsibilities, that impacts the ability of the police Department to create community trust and faith in the ability of police officers to fulfill their obligations.",29,,
205,0.97,2095.326,2099.564,Those are legitimate issues to take a look at.,29,,
206,0.97,2099.564,2117.248,"We know that research from nonpartisan groups, like advanced democracy, show that before January 6th, there were calls for violence that proliferated in tens of thousands of comments Online.",29,,
207,0.97,2117.248,2148.312,"Since 2006, the FBI has been warning us that Extremist groups have had strong ties to law enforcement . My hope would have been that the OPA investigation did more than it did to look into the question of what the officers who attended on January 6th, what sort of event they thought they were attending.",29,,
208,0.97,2148.312,2159.29,"Did they see the call for violence on tens of thousands of comments on Twitter, Tiktok, and other message boards?",29,,
209,0.97,2159.29,2164.729,Did they hear President Trump say that it was going to be wild?,29,,
210,0.97,2164.729,2179.243,Were there inquiries or interviews with folks who the officers had talked to in advance about their plans to attend?,29,,

212,0.97,2188.953,2206.637,"I am also concerned that the report itself suggests that the phone records, specifically Tweets, were deleted . OPA says that Seattle I.T.",29,,
213,0.97,2206.637,2218.849,"Attempted to recover those phone records, but I do have questions of whether or not we consulted, or whether or not OPA consulted with professional I.T.",29,,
214,0.97,2218.849,2230.194,Forensic outfits to see whether or not those texts could be restored.,29,,
215,0.97,2230.194,2249.914,"The police Commission has also noted the importance of addressing extremism within the Department and in the wake of the announcement last week, stated that soon after the attack, chief Diaz was asked how they plan to investigate and address extremism within the Department ranks.",29,,
216,0.97,2249.914,2298.362,"The Department of defense, the Houston police Department, and other law enforcement agencies across the country have publicized plans to address this issue, SPD's plans remain unclear . I have also asked the chief about this, noting that the office of the employee on Bud is working with the American universities extremism research and innovation lab, known as Parol, to Pilate it among employees in several departments . a few months ago when I inquired with Dr. Khan about the police Department's involvement in this, details about Department employees were still pending.",29,,
217,0.97,2298.362,2314.845,"Although apparently commitments from other departments including the Seattle fire Department were in hand at that time . again, this was probably in early June that I made this inquiry.",29,,
218,0.97,2314.845,2339.937,"I am hoping to hear more from chief Diaz about his participation in this important effort being led by the office of the employee . Lastly, just a few words around the weekly Hst update that I seek to provide on the work of the human services Department.",29,,

294,0.97,3055.118,3060.59,"This is being funded by $400,000 grant that they received as part of the C.A.R.E.S.",35,,
295,0.97,3060.59,3093.056,"Act to identify high demand industries and help create an understanding of regional workforce needs . among those needs are housing . I'm sure everyone saw the editorial in this morning's paper, talking about how we really need to not just talk about attracting industry and jobs and supporting growth and recovery there, but also really meeting the housing needs the workers in our community have a place to live.",35,,
296,0.97,3093.056,3096.86,This will all be part of the work that we are doing there.,35,,

300,0.97,3130.26,3132.062,I encourage folks to take a look at that.,35,,

302,0.97,3134.498,3144.474,"Moving on to departments, last week I met with the interim director for the arts Department.",35,,
303,0.97,3144.474,3149.88,They had been under the impression that a search for a permanent director was underway.,35,,
304,0.97,3149.88,3152.816,My understanding is that has been put on hold.,35,,
305,0.97,3152.816,3172.536,"The arts Commission were commissioners are interested in engaging in a Stakeholder process with community members to get some help identifying priorities for what the city's next art director, like what kind of qualities and experience that director should have.",35,,

308,0.97,3208.238,3216.446,I also met with the office of economic development's interim director to talk about a few different things.,35,,
309,0.97,3216.446,3234.397,She informed me she has briefed the film task force and notified them that Oed will not be moving forward with a film Commission at this point.,35,,
310,0.97,3234.397,3240.337,I think there has been a decision to really focus on recovery and they are working to get some priorities for the film task force for 2021 and 2022.,35,,
311,0.97,3240.337,3248.612,I am hoping to receive recommendations from Oed on how to proceed with that work.,35,,
312,0.97,3248.612,3255.785,I have been told they will make that presentation once those recommendations are finalized.,35,,

317,0.97,3301.464,3319.149,"We are hoping to have the documents by the end of next week . We may not be able to begin hearing in my July Committee, but if not, we will begin that process in August.",35,,
318,0.97,3319.149,3340.07,It may require that we have a special committee meeting to meet the public hearing Timeline and to try to get this done before we began our budget conversations . It is likely we will need a special meeting in early September . I just want to give folks a heads up about that.,35,,
319,0.97,3340.07,3346.576,Last week I met with neighbors in the Chinatown International district to discuss graffiti issues and other public safety issues that are happening.,35,,
320,0.97,3346.576,3366.229,Folks are really hoping we can Prioritize that neighborhood in terms of getting folks sheltered . There is a growing presence on King street . There was a lot Oâ–ˆF great work happening in Tha neighborhood several months ago . The work must continue . I met with them to talk about that.,35,,

324,0.97,3391.855,3398.561,I have been receiving many calls and Emails regarding the closure of the park Beach due to a lack of lifeguards.,35,,
325,0.97,3398.561,3410.84,"As Councilmember Juarez mentioned, this park has one of the highest uses in the city and we are still mourning the loss of the young man who drowned in the Bay on June 26th.",35,,
326,0.97,3410.84,3436.499,"Safety has been an ongoing issue and Drownings are far too frequent in that area . having no lifeguards at that swim Beach and closing the beach for the rest of the summer is very problematic . It is not going to deter people from swimming there, especially when we are having the record-breaking heat we have been having.",35,,
327,0.97,3436.499,3456.586,"Will only put neighbors at greater risk . My office has been in contact with the parks Department already to learn more and we will continue to advocate for opening the beach for people of Seattle .

336,0.97,3502.332,3505.568,"Good morning, Council President.",37,,
337,0.97,3505.568,3511.241,There are two items from the Finance and housing Committee on today's Council agenda.,37,,
338,0.97,3511.241,3522.485,"The first is 120117. this legislation is going straight to full council . was on the introduction and referral calendar on Tuesday, July 6th.",37,,
339,0.97,3522.485,3536.199,"This legislation relates to last year's past legislation which was ordinance 126161, which created the 2021 lt Geo tax coupon Fund.",37,,
340,0.97,3536.199,3551.114,That was authorization to support spending on the West Seattle bridge in anticipation of the 2021 proceeds.,37,,
341,0.97,3551.114,3558.221,This was before the 2021 adopted budget was presented and before the decision for the repair of the bridge.,37,,
342,0.97,3558.221,3565.929,The anticipated additional bond sales for the X Aquarium expansion project.,37,,
343,0.97,3565.929,3578.341,"They have since determined we can sell Nontaxable for the repair effort, but these proceeds will need to be held in a separate Fund.",37,,
344,0.97,3578.341,3588.284,"That is why it is coming to Council . It is technical in nature and we hope to move it through rather quickly, given the technical nature of the bill.",37,,
345,0.97,3588.284,3600.663,"We also have Council bill 120114, the park property legislation acquisition that we heard on Friday.",37,,
346,0.97,3600.663,3603.032,I know there is a lot of excitement around this legislation.,37,,
347,0.97,3603.032,3612.875,This will authorize the office of housing to acquire two in South Park for affordable Hosing development along with community ground Workspace.,37,,
348,0.97,3612.875,3630.693,This is the first time the office of housing will be utilizing the direct authority that the Council increased in $2019- $30 million through an amendment that was sponsored at the time for your support for that amendment I brought forward.,37,,
349,0.97,3630.693,3641.904,"We made the increase of the office of housing could act quickly on this exact type of land acquisition . in the recent update that we have in front of us since 2001 in June, we now have removed that cap.",37,,
350,0.97,3641.904,3659.188,First we expanded it to $30 million and now we have removed the cap completely so we can office additional flexibility recognizing here may be an increase in acquisition opportunities due to market changes especially in the wake of Covid.,37,,
351,0.97,3659.188,3695.091,This is a really important opportunity for our city to acquire additional parcels of property either for public use or to be passed on directly to community organizations that are specifically rooted in communities that are directly experiencing displacement and folks that have been long unable to compete in the market . This is how we disrupt market practices and this is why it was so exciting for us to be able to enter into this partnership with the folks in South park and follow their lead and be able to acquire the property.,37,,
352,0.97,3695.091,3709.405,"This bill, 120114, was passed from my Committee on Friday and due to the timing of the purchase, it is important for us to move as quickly as possible.",37,,
353,0.97,3709.405,3717.58,Thanks so much to the Council president for her work as well as her agreement to move this onto Monday's full council agenda.,37,,

355,0.97,3723.286,3746.342,"60% of the area medium income as well as community space on the ground floor, creating a sense of place . the community has asked us to acquire the site and to do affordable housing development with community priorities in mind, and that is exactly what we are excited to do with them and in partnership.",37,,
356,0.97,3746.342,3753.015,Thank you to the South Park community for their advocacy and leadership on this issue and to the office of housing.,37,,

363,0.97,3807.87,3814.977,They have been risking the lives of their family and safety as well.,37,,
364,0.97,3814.977,3828.391,They told me story after story of workers who didn't have enough support staff with them and they had been reduced to a skeleton crew.,37,,
365,0.97,3828.391,3847.91,"This had compromised the health and safety of their patients and put extreme pressure on them to be able to complete their work and their rounds . folks expressed they were still experiencing being told to take their intermittent breaks, which is something I have spent many years fighting against.",37,,
366,0.97,3847.91,3867.73,"There is no such thing as an intermittent break . If you need to use the Restroom for three minutes one hour and use the Restroom again after two hours, that does not allow a six minute break.",37,,
367,0.97,3867.73,3873.236,They are owed full rest and meal breaks.,37,,
368,0.97,3873.236,3897.059,"That among other issues around health and safety concerns for the number of staff they have, the lack of respect in the workplace, and the need to make sure they are adequately consonant compensated and making sure needs institutions are not being used as training grounds for people to go on a year or two to other Healthcare institutions because there is no way they can compete with those wages.",37,,
369,0.97,3897.059,3915.845,We need to be paying these workers what they are owed and respecting them in the workplace as well . I look forward to continuing to stand in solidarity with 1199 Healthcare members and I hope there is a daylight on the issues they're facing at the bargaining table.,37,,
370,0.97,3915.845,3925.488,These messages of solidarity from electives and community members will help to make sure they feel supported and hopefully this will lead to resolutions.,37,,
371,0.97,3925.488,3934.997,Thank you again to members of 1199 for reaching out and please NOTE we are sending you strengths and messages of solidarity.,37,,

374,0.97,3949.412,3963.492,"It is an annual conference they usually host around the nation and Unfortunately due to Covid, this year and last year I was not able to attend in person.",37,,

378,0.97,3973.002,3988.918,"I will also note the Department of early learning--excuse me, Department of education and early learning has noted Seattle is one of the only cities that has done direct cash investment for child care providers, which is getting a lot of appreciation.",37,,
379,0.97,3988.918,3998.16,"Thanks, colleagues, for the Seattle rescue plan . that is something that Seattle can be proud of across our nation.",37,,
380,0.97,3998.16,4001.998,Later today I will be attending the kickoff of the public health recruitment community advisory committee.,37,,

382,0.97,4016.078,4017.079,We wish her luck.,37,,

386,0.97,4070.399,4108.938,"They are marking the second anniversary with a month-long social media campaign . anything Y'all can do to help us emphasize and lift up these messages will be extremely important . As you know, hiring entities are not necessarily used to employers . whether it is in your home to clean it or to take care of Kiddos or take care of Elders or to take care of yards, we get the information to all hiring entities about their rights and responsibilities under the law and workers as domestic workers, whether independent contractors or employees of a firm, they know their rights as well.",37,,
387,0.97,4108.938,4114.276,It is difficult to do outreach as the hiring entities and workers.,37,,
388,0.97,4114.276,4129.391,I appreciate the Council's efforts over the past few years to have increased the budget to support the campaign to get information out and to help folks on all sides know their rights and responsibilities.,37,,
