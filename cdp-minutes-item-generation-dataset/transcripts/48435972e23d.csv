42,0.97,240.273,241.574,Good morning Council members.,11,,
43,0.97,241.574,248.014,My name is Robin Briggs and I wanted to talk about the second downtown link tunnel.,11,,
44,0.97,248.014,252.685,I'm all in favor I think it will make a tremendous improvement some helping people get around.,11,,
45,0.97,252.685,254.587,But I'm concerned about how deep the Tum is going to be.,11,,
46,0.97,254.587,263.763,Just getting down to the station is going it take a long time and no one is going to want to get off because what if the Escalators or elevators aren't working?,11,,
47,0.97,263.763,266.666,What if there is an emergency?,11,,
48,0.97,266.666,268.301,How will people get out?,11,,
49,0.97,268.301,276.509,I snow a Shaller Tum will cause 30 more disruption but this rail line will likely be in use for 100 years.,11,,
50,0.97,276.509,279.445,We can tolerate some short-term disruption instead of accepting an adequate end result.,11,,
51,0.97,279.445,287.62,"It ill with be better for everyone in the long-term, including the local property owners.",11,,
52,0.97,287.62,294.527,A Shaller tunnel will also be much cheaper which could allow for future connections to Aurora and South park.,11,,
53,0.97,294.527,302.335,And he simpler possibly avoiding the problems that plagued the last tunnel when a relatively small error was almost to derail the whole project.,11,,
54,0.97,302.335,307.14,Our infrastructure needs to be reliable and robust and I'm afraid this would be neither.,11,,
55,0.97,307.14,308.675,Let's build for the long-term.,11,,
56,0.97,308.675,317.016,Please ask sound transit to build a cut and cover solution.,11,,

63,0.97,333.966,341.274,We have read hundreds of the pages with community groups and Seattle subway has some key recommendations today.,13,,
64,0.97,341.274,349.816,74% of Seattleites polled already want to approve a sound transit board and half of Seattle are Unserved by SD 3.,13,,
65,0.97,349.816,352.085,So expansion is inevitable.,13,,
66,0.97,352.085,364.63,As such we ask Council to protect major climate justice income and equity goes by Councilman dating construction of cost saving expansion futures if the future equity rail corridors.,13,,
67,0.97,364.63,378.578,"Fails to Quip the any do you want tunnel with relatively expansion features, physically big enough station platforms and built in off ramps to protect the Tum from year long shutdowns.",13,,
68,0.97,378.578,385.952,Seattle city council must fight for Seattle interests by requesting new features to priority equity rail corridors.,13,,
69,0.97,385.952,398.164,"Including forth Seattle's Aurora 99 corridor, South park and South King County and King County Metro 8 in central Alti.",13,,
70,0.97,398.164,408.841,Second the city must Prioritize advance work on the citywide rail plan as soon as possible in order to codify the equity expansion corridors identified above.,14,,
71,0.97,408.841,421.721,"Third, city council put firmly reject all deep four tunnel station option dollars, some designs exceeding 18 on feet deep in favor of shallow tunnel designs.",14,,
72,0.97,421.721,433.8,"Sound transit Inaccurately predicts times to reach the station platform from the street, risking a faster travel time for riders to walk or bus instead of using these light rail stations.",14,,
73,0.97,433.8,445.311,"As well, elderly and riders should never be expected to climb a Stairwell the height of an underground 18 story building in an emergency situation.",14,,
74,0.97,445.311,450.85,Importantly sound transit never studied small low options and avoided the pitfalls.,14,,
75,0.97,452.552,454.187,.,14,,

79,0.97,469.869,475.775,"It has been a wildly successful program, popular and used by 276 small businesses so far.",16,,
80,0.97,475.775,484.083,"It has been good for public health, good for the shawl businesses and workers, and just God for the quality of life in our neighborhoods.",16,,
81,0.97,484.083,488.354,Council member Strauss has proposed to extend the program I think it is really wise.,16,,
82,0.97,488.354,491.757,No need to rush into something permanent.,16,,
83,0.97,491.757,503.236,We can look around for cautionary tales of rushing too quickly to try and create a permanent program and both of those cities added too much cost and red tape and now the programs are sort of going up in flames.,16,,
84,0.97,503.236,508.374,So let's take the time to get this right and make sure it works for businesses across the city.,16,,
85,0.97,508.374,516.716,What works in Queen Anne may not work in South park and we need to figure out how to make this program work for small business districts across the city.,16,,
86,0.97,516.716,519.051,"And Lastly, this is going to be a positive thing to.",16,,
87,0.97,519.051,521.354,Can out of the pandemic.,16,,
88,0.97,521.354,529.795,Been a challenging time and it can be an important permanent program.,16,,

93,0.97,543.042,601.6,"Thank you, David Haynes district 7. before sound transit impresses us with their inflated dollar amounts and sophisticated cost cutting that makes them rich with cheap, low quality rattling, Uneach and loud annoying ugly deep New York City tunnel copy cat projects from West Seattle to Ballard, how about simply offering a train on the waterfront that goes directly to Golden gardens with stops at ex Pedia, interplay and a number 44 bus waiting at Golden gardens like it used to before Metro sabotaged most bus routes it make it seem we need billions for outmoded trains as if Seattle always has to copy elsewhere.",19,,

98,0.97,622.955,638.904,"Now I oftentimes this type of bureaucratic red tape and just you know, slowing of the process is what kind of kills the overall capability of these really important projects.",21,,
99,0.97,638.904,667.566,Now this train system that we are you know looking to across Seattle is one of the most you know ambitious projects in America right new is also one of the most important as the train as the trains are simply the superior way of transportation and is necessary for us to reach a certain level of climate mitigation.,21,,
100,0.97,667.566,679.278,"Trains can be incredibly essential and I hope the Seattle Council doesn't game P this expansion in West Seattle for, you know, some simple business interests.",21,,
101,0.97,679.278,683.416,Or for a slight inconvenience to homeowners in the very Short- term.,21,,
102,0.97,683.416,695.895,"You know, I really hope that we really do Prioritize the long- term benefit of this project over any sort of short-term neglect.",21,,

122,0.97,787.787,810.809,"This particular advisory board was updated 30 years later in 2007 with resolution 30995, which give the Council more authority over the appointment, similar to Council's authority for other transportation advisory boards, where we split appointment with the Mayor's office and still approve those submitted by the Mayor.",27,,
123,0.97,810.809,830.362,"Resolution 30995 also said advisory board members shall be representatives of different geographic locations throughout the city, and Dr. Douglas Mig Den is from district 7, which is important as we currently do not have any representation on the bike board for that district and yet many of our investments are downtown.",27,,

138,0.97,909.341,915.447,We can hear you if you want to tell us why you want to join the bike board.,32,,
139,0.97,915.447,918.05,"I can, hold on a second.",33,,
140,0.97,918.05,918.417,He just.,33,,
141,0.97,918.417,921.687,You can see me now.,34,,
142,0.97,921.687,923.889,"Hi, thanks for having me today.",34,,
143,0.97,923.889,931.563,And I appreciate the opportunity to serve on the Advisory board.,34,,
144,0.97,931.563,939.972,"Yes, I have done these long races, 4000 kilometers across Europe, including Eastern Europe and one that was 500 across Australia.",34,,

150,0.97,969.668,976.875,"One particular issue I'm interested in, is it seems like a kid on a bicycle in Seattle is a bit of an endangered species.",34,,
151,0.97,976.875,984.049,"Early in the pandemic we saw more kids on bicycles, since there was for traffic.",34,,
152,0.97,984.049,993.292,I realized that what is practical might be limited but it would be nice to make more streets safe for kids and families and safer for everybody.,34,,
153,0.97,993.292,998.897,"So I have some different perspective, perhaps and have seen things from a few different points of view.",34,,
154,0.97,998.897,1004.67,"And hopefully, I can help the Advisory board and the city at large.",34,,
155,0.97,1004.67,1007.206,"Thank you, Dr. Mig Den.",35,,

162,0.97,1034.967,1044.81,"Dr.Mig Den, hearing you do unsupported races, that is a very big difference between supported rites rides.",36,,
163,0.97,1044.81,1049.214,"Having done unsupported races myself by Kayak, not bike, I can tell you that Resonates deeply with me.",36,,

194,0.97,1267.065,1271.637,Tell us a little bit about yourself and your interest in the transit advisory board.,41,,
195,0.97,1271.637,1275.807,I don't thanks Council member and thanks for the introduction.,41,,
196,0.97,1275.807,1278.71,It is great to meet you all this morning.,41,,
197,0.97,1278.71,1286.652,I live currently in the Queen Anne neighborhood but I spent most of my life growing up in North northeast Seattle in the Northgate Maple leaf area.,41,,
198,0.97,1286.652,1290.789,And had just a very interesting experience growing up with public transportation.,41,,
199,0.97,1290.789,1302.934,"Grew up on the 73 bus route for those of you who are familiar with it in northeast Seattle, and spent most of my childhood commuting all around the city by bus, with my family.",41,,
200,0.97,1302.934,1309.141,"It actually led to me getting involved Civilly in the woodland park zoo, as was mentioned earlier.",41,,
201,0.97,1309.141,1313.011,And rolling for them when I was in high school.,41,,
202,0.97,1313.011,1329.428,Still a pretty active volunteer in that space on both their events and their social service side with community members at the mid example high school level about how we get Underserved and underprivileged Seattle public school students to and from the zoo and for various outreach programs.,41,,
203,0.97,1329.428,1340.238,Which for those of you who know the location of the zoo it is for the exactly the best location for transit access sometimes.,41,,
204,0.97,1340.238,1357.155,So I ended up writing my actually entry essay to college about public transportation in Seattle which was a very interesting period in my life and got to go to UCLA and do a thesis on transportation and access challenges for the wider community.,41,,
205,0.97,1357.155,1359.691,"Funny enough, I'm now sort of on the corporate side.",41,,
206,0.97,1359.691,1368.734,"I work 30 Boeing here and prior to the pandemic was a pretty avid reverse commute tore Everett, which is a funny commute for anybody who wants to try it.",41,,
207,0.97,1368.734,1371.77,Now a little bit easier with the lit rail.,41,,
208,0.97,1371.77,1400.966,"But when this opportunity came up and I got in touch with the folks at Sdot, just such an Exiting opportunity forgive back a little bit to the community about the buses that I know and love and that many of my colleagues and friends and people that I serve at the zoo and other communities really rely on to be reliable and safe, particularly with all the development that is going in, in some of our urban development areas.",41,,
209,0.97,1400.966,1405.737,There is just such an overwhelming question for new arrivals if they should have a car or not in the city.,41,,
210,0.97,1405.737,1421.186,"And part of my goal in serving on the board is to try to make transit the number one choice that they have versus having to feel that they have to rely on a car to get around, especially as a new transplant to the city from wherever they are coming from.",41,,
211,0.97,1421.186,1429.227,"So just really looking forward to being of service to the community and happy to be here this morning, council member.",41,,
212,0.97,1429.227,1435.167,Thank you very much.,42,,
213,0.97,1435.167,1437.269,"Committee members, any questions?",42,,
214,0.97,1437.269,1438.203,Council member Morales?,42,,
215,0.97,1438.203,1438.637,Thank you.,43,,
216,0.97,1438.637,1442.741,I don't have any questions for these gentlemen.,43,,
217,0.97,1442.741,1448.446,I do want to say thank you to Mr. about bar and Dr. Mig Den for your interest.,43,,
218,0.97,1448.446,1456.288,"I think we have, all have a deep appreciation for the people who put their names forward to serve on these boards and commissions.",43,,
219,0.97,1456.288,1464.396,Because all of these serve really valuable purpose for us as Council members.,43,,
220,0.97,1464.396,1471.236,"You know, Commission members, bored members are provide advocacy, provide research and are some of the loudest voices for equity in the city.",43,,
221,0.97,1471.236,1475.607,So I want to thank both gentlemen for putting your names forward.,43,,
222,0.97,1475.607,1478.944,I was a human rights Commissioner myself and I know how much work is involved.,43,,
223,0.97,1478.944,1484.216,And I know you do it for free because you love the city.,43,,
224,0.97,1484.216,1495.76,"I do want to say you know, these commissions and boards have processes for how they make appointment.",43,,
225,0.97,1495.76,1496.661,"They review applications, do interviews.",43,,
226,0.97,1496.661,1506.037,"And so it is, it can be frustrating when the folks that they have chosen, through community process are not selected.",43,,
227,0.97,1506.037,1511.643,"And I understand that there is you know, why folks might feel demoralized when that happens.",43,,
228,0.97,1511.643,1530.862,"So I just think it is important for us to remember that all of our boards and commissions advise us they are all constituents with professional experience, with lived experience, that is really important to us as Council members, and is really an asset to bring.",43,,
229,0.97,1530.862,1534.499,And I just think that the process itself deserves our respect.,43,,
230,0.97,1534.499,1550.715,"So with that, I look forward to finding ways that we can all work together to lift up these boards and commissions, pay attention to their recommendations and their voices at Council and look forward to working with all of you.",43,,
231,0.97,1550.715,1551.149,Thanks very much.,43,,

236,0.97,1566.798,1574.039,"And I too was a frequent rider of the 73, 72, 91, 65, 75, 48.",45,,

258,0.97,1663.862,1670.535,So I would like to provide him with an it up to make some introductory remarks.,50,,
259,0.97,1670.535,1671.136,Just a reminder.,50,,
260,0.97,1671.136,1676.174,We did have a formal prep Tation last week.,50,,
261,0.97,1676.174,1685.917,They are here again to take any outstanding questions before we take a vote today on this proposed extension of the free permits for street Kavanaugh phase.,50,,
262,0.97,1685.917,1689.487,"Council member Strauss, why don't you go ahead and led this off?",50,,
263,0.97,1689.487,1690.055,"I don't thank you, chair.",50,,
264,0.97,1690.055,1694.259,I am very glad to be back before the committee speaking about this.,50,,
265,0.97,1694.259,1696.928,We had it in the committee just a couple of WESCO ago.,50,,
266,0.97,1696.928,1701.466,And we have had this bill before us previously.,50,,
267,0.97,1701.466,1705.67,Where we have provided this extension to get to may 2022.,50,,
268,0.97,1705.67,1710.308,The extension before us today takes us out to January of 2023.,50,,
269,0.97,1710.308,1729.561,"This is the time that we are going to take and Sdot is working feverishly around the clock to get the policies right sized for our cities so we can have outdoor dining permanently in the city of Seattle and that the policies are best fit for both customers, business owners and the general public.",50,,
270,0.97,1729.561,1734.265,And being able to do this balance in the right way does take some time.,50,,
271,0.97,1734.265,1746.144,"So that is why I'm excited to be back before you today, requesting another extension of the free permits so we are able to get these policies right sized.",50,,
272,0.97,1746.144,1746.544,"Thank you, chair.",50,,
273,0.97,1746.544,1748.413,"Thank you, council member Strauss.",51,,
274,0.97,1748.413,1750.915,"And again, we do have Sdot and central staff here.",51,,
275,0.97,1750.915,1753.751,I don't know if you have anything to add.,51,,
276,0.97,1753.751,1761.292,We did have a thorough presentation last time and we should be ready to vote this out of committee today.,51,,
277,0.97,1761.292,1770.568,I guess I'll wait to see if any other committee members have any other comments or questions.,51,,
278,0.97,1770.568,1772.57,"I'm not seeing it but Council member Strauss, please.",51,,
279,0.97,1772.57,1774.606,"Yeah, I'll add on to that a little bit.",52,,
280,0.97,1774.606,1780.512,I was going to see if anyone else had comments or questions and maybe this information would have come out of that process.,52,,
281,0.97,1780.512,1781.813,Here I am now speaking again.,52,,
282,0.97,1781.813,1793.057,Ening one of the things this is really important to figure out is the permitting and the Fez associated with these permits.,52,,
283,0.97,1793.057,1800.198,Because in the past the fees have been Hines ward to the amount of parking revenue that would be again rated from a spot on the curb.,52,,
284,0.97,1800.198,1808.807,"We know that not everywhere in the city has paid parking, so that created a bit of an uneven playing field for some.",52,,
285,0.97,1808.807,1819.851,"When we only take into consideration what parking reference Mizzou could be again rated, we are not considering the sales tax revenue that is being again rated from the increased commercial activity in that space.",52,,
286,0.97,1819.851,1828.993,"So I just, I know that in the past we have to tick us back one more step, we have always had these types of permits in Seattle.",52,,
287,0.97,1828.993,1842.173,"And the up take during the pandemic was because we made them free, temporarily and because we were more flexible with how we were permitting these.",52,,
288,0.97,1842.173,1852.383,"Folks remember little park lets or the walk dining it was very narrow, small.",52,,
289,0.97,1852.383,1855.52,And the cost was very high to the shop owners.,52,,
290,0.97,1855.52,1866.731,So by allowing this time for the temporary free cost of the permit and the ability to be more flexible with the policy making we see on Ballard Avenue the structure is going to be a little bit wider.,52,,
291,0.97,1866.731,1873.638,For other places the structures need to be a little tighter.,52,,
292,0.97,1873.638,1877.942,We have seen retail on the sidewalks and on the curb.,52,,
293,0.97,1877.942,1884.782,Having the time to pilot these different options that be meaningful and I know Sdot is close to being aim to get these policies for the right size for our city.,52,,
294,0.97,1884.782,1897.328,I just wanted to take that moment to talk about the fees and that Beneed to take into consideration the sales tax being generated from these spaces.,52,,
295,0.97,1897.328,1899.53,"That is all I've got for today, chair.",52,,
296,0.97,1899.53,1904.302,"Thank you, council member Strauss.",53,,
297,0.97,1904.302,1907.138,"Committee members, if I other comments or questions?",53,,
298,0.97,1907.138,1907.338,Okay.,53,,

347,0.97,2152.483,2152.817,Great.,75,,
348,0.97,2152.817,2157.188,"Let's say hello quickly to Marshall for the and Sarah Max, good morning.",75,,

I don't and I'm Sarah Max, the sound transit program director at Sdot supporting Marshall in his role and leading the interdepartmental city wide team.",76,,
351,0.97,2178.476,2180.778,Thank you all for being here.,77,,
352,0.97,2180.778,2185.75,I know sound transit has an extensive power point to attempt to summarize the draft for us.,77,,
353,0.97,2185.75,2192.99,And it is going to be a great resource for the public as well.,77,,
354,0.97,2192.99,2195.593,Lots of information on their Websites.,77,,
355,0.97,2195.593,2200.431,And this does a good job summarizing that.,77,,
356,0.97,2200.431,2203.334,"So sound transit, take it away.",77,,
357,0.97,2203.334,2203.701,Thank you.,78,,
358,0.97,2203.701,2206.938,"Chair Peterson, members of the committee.",78,,
359,0.97,2206.938,2213.578,"As noted, this is an extensive presentation, but I would note that it is still just an overview of a lot of information as mentioned in the draft.",78,,
360,0.97,2213.578,2216.847,So I'll be going through a lot of information today.,78,,
361,0.97,2216.847,2223.521,And there may be questions which indeed we can follow-up on if more detail is needed.,78,,
362,0.97,2223.521,2240.871,"So as I said, why we are here today to share an overview of the draft process and the community engagement collaboration associated with that and to provide a Snapshot of the results and our station planning program.",79,,
363,0.97,2240.871,2244.875,A little bit about a project background.,80,,
364,0.97,2244.875,2249.747,The West Scott Van Pelt extensions were clouded in the sound transit 3 plan.,80,,
365,0.97,2249.747,2254.885,They basically comprise two light rail extensions and a new light rail only downtown tunnel.,80,,
366,0.97,2254.885,2262.193,And they amount to about 1 miles of new light rail service that will serve 14 stations.,80,,
367,0.97,2262.193,2271.168,"This is a look at the system as will be in 2032, showing on the left here and in 2049 when the full system is built out.",81,,
368,0.97,2271.168,2276.741,I just wanted to take a moment to plain this you there is something to be understood here.,81,,
369,0.97,2276.741,2286.417,"On the left in 2032 when the West Seattle extension opens, you see that pink line with a number 3 there.",81,,
370,0.97,2286.417,2288.319,The West Seattle extension initially will connect into Soto.,81,,
371,0.97,2288.319,2298.029,"For a period of five years or so, people who are coming from West Seattle will transfer to the main line at Soto.",81,,
372,0.97,2298.029,2307.271,"Five years later, the Ballard extension will open and the map on the right shows the full expansion of the system, which will be complete by 2042.",81,,
373,0.97,2307.271,2314.145,"In that time frame, at that time, West Seattle would connect into the existing downtown tunnel.",81,,
374,0.97,2314.145,2322.92,"So folks would no longer need Titrants per at Soto, they would connect right into downtown and go all the way up to Everett without making a transfer.",81,,
375,0.97,2322.92,2328.926,At the Ballard link extension will connect into a new downtown tunnel that will connect on down to Tacoma.,81,,
376,0.97,2328.926,2339.837,"So just wanted to explain the transition, if you like, and the operating system when we move from 2032 to the future state.",81,,
377,0.97,2339.837,2341.439,This is a quick look at our project Timeline.,82,,
378,0.97,2341.439,2346.877,We are over on the left here in the planning phase.,82,,
379,0.97,2346.877,2348.379,In the grown box.,82,,
380,0.97,2348.379,2351.515,We started back in 2017 and hopefully concludes next year.,82,,
381,0.97,2351.515,2357.722,Our objective during the planning phase was to figure out what we are going to carry forward into design and construction.,82,,
382,0.97,2357.722,2361.859,So we have a lot of different alternatives moving through this process.,82,,
383,0.97,2361.859,2369.934,But the whole intent of the planning phase is to decide on what we will ultimately build take forward into design and construction.,82,,
384,0.97,2369.934,2378.442,On the right side of this graphic are schedules to get to West Seattle is 2032 and Ballard is 2037.,82,,
385,0.97,2378.442,2379.376,That is our target schedule for Ballard.,82,,
386,0.97,2379.376,2384.548,You can see there we do have an Affordability gap.,82,,
387,0.97,2384.548,2398.129,"If we cannot close that gap, by additional funding our cost savings then the portion of the Ballard extension between Smith Cove and Ballard the last couple of stations would not open until 2039.",82,,
388,0.97,2398.129,2401.532,As mentioned we started this project a few years ago.,83,,
389,0.97,2401.532,2404.602,We went through an alternative development phase.,83,,
390,0.97,2404.602,2409.106,Some folks here I know were very familiar with that phase we had.,83,,
391,0.97,2409.106,2415.713,A lot of engagement at the Council level in that process.,83,,
392,0.97,2415.713,2421.252,And we went through that process between 2017 and early 2019.,83,,
393,0.97,2421.252,2429.293,At the end of that process the board identified other alternatives to carry forward into environmental review.,83,,
394,0.97,2429.293,2454.985,"No the whole purpose of the development screening process was to as it suggests screen from a broad range of initial alternatives, further screen and evaluate those alternatives and get down to a Subset that we could study in detail in the Drost EI so we have been studying the alternatives that came out of this Inin addition alternatives development process.",83,,
395,0.97,2454.985,2473.838,These the Graphing on the left here highlights the alternatives that were identified through the initial phase and have been studied if detail in the draft EI S. I'll speak about these in more detail as I move through the next slides.,84,,
396,0.97,2473.838,2479.376,"So, as mentioned, coming out of alternatives, we have taken them through environmental review.",85,,
397,0.97,2479.376,2485.149,Published a draft document a couple of weeks ago and we are now in the public comment period.,85,,
398,0.97,2485.149,2489.887,And as mentioned this is a 90 day public comment period that extends to late April.,85,,
399,0.97,2489.887,2505.836,"After the public comment period, based on the technical information in the draft EI s, and the public feedback, with he will go back to the sound transit board, hopefully in June and request that they confirm or modify the preferred alternative that was previously identified.",85,,
400,0.97,2505.836,2511.942,"We'll then publish a final EI s next year, and return to the board again and ask they select the project to be built.",85,,
401,0.97,2511.942,2527.424,"At that point, that will be at the conclusion the environmental process, the planning process, and we can then move forward into final design and construction.",85,,
402,0.97,2527.424,2529.793,The draft period extends until April 28.,86,,
403,0.97,2529.793,2531.695,So a three month period.,86,,
404,0.97,2531.695,2538.569,"I want to emphasize, as I have already said that, today I'll be giving a high level overview of the information.",86,,
405,0.97,2538.569,2546.243,But I do encourage folks to look at the draft environmental statement document itself available in many different Venues.,86,,
406,0.97,2546.243,2548.646,This is an image what the front page of the executive summary.,86,,
407,0.97,2548.646,2564.628,It is a good place to start if you want to get a basic orientation to the project and there is a lot more orientation in the document as well and hopefully that will inform your comments if you choose to provide comments on the alternatives in the document.,86,,
408,0.97,2564.628,2579.777,"As I have been going through this work effort, and in partnership with the city, here's a little of the racial equity outcomes that we developed, which are informed by prior community engagement.",87,,
409,0.97,2579.777,2582.346,I'll take a moment to read through them.,87,,
410,0.97,2582.346,2602.032,"The first one is advanced environmental economic justice to improve economic and health outcome for communities of color, enhance mobility and access for communities of color, low income populations, create opportunities for equitable development that include expanding housing and community assets for communities of color.",87,,
411,0.97,2602.032,2621.619,"Avoid disproportionate impacts on communities of color and low income populations, create a sense for belonging for communities of color make a station where everyone SEES themselves as belonging being safe and being welcome, and meaningfully involving in the project.",87,,
412,0.97,2621.619,2630.194,"Together with the city, we have developed a racial equity tool kit report which build on the environmental justice analysis included in the Dr. .",88,,
413,0.97,2630.194,2633.23,It is released as a draft.,88,,
414,0.97,2633.23,2646.744,You can access it at our Online open house and it will be updated based on comments received during the draft common period.,88,,
415,0.97,2646.744,2656.086,I'm going to hand it over who will briefly describe some of our community engagement operation efforts.,89,,
416,0.97,2656.086,2657.521,"Thank you, Cahill.",90,,
417,0.97,2657.521,2659.49,I'm glad to be here today.,90,,
418,0.97,2659.49,2666.23,So this chart provides a Snapshot of the community engagement and collaboration process.,90,,
419,0.97,2666.23,2674.938,"As you can see, across the top, you'll see the chart captures from late 2021 through the first half of 2022.",90,,
420,0.97,2674.938,2682.446,"From January through much of April is the public comment period, the Finfet day comment period Cahill mentioned.",90,,
421,0.97,2682.446,2686.75,Across the left you see a Snapshot of the engagement process.,90,,
422,0.97,2686.75,2693.59,This is just a Snapshot to provide meaningful engagement and to facilitate broad participation.,90,,
423,0.97,2693.59,2697.995,Which I'll highlight a little bit more after the slide here.,90,,
424,0.97,2697.995,2703.634,"But turning back to this chart, and starting with the draft public meetings, those are occurring in March.",90,,
425,0.97,2703.634,2719.183,And you can see that there will be four virtual public meetings and one in person meeting providing that state did local guidelines related to Covid allow for that.,90,,
426,0.97,2719.183,2723.454,We then have the community advisory groups in red.,90,,
427,0.97,2723.454,2731.762,"And starting here in November, we kicked off some process with a process review.",90,,
428,0.97,2731.762,2738.235,Then in January these groups dug into station planning.,90,,
429,0.97,2738.235,2740.904,In February these groups met with the Dr. result.,90,,
430,0.97,2740.904,2747.277,"Next month they will be doing a Dr. result deep dive, digging deeper into those results and so on.",90,,
431,0.97,2747.277,2762.893,"As each month progresses, these groups are building common ground and understanding highlighting specific issues and trade offices and ultimately their feedback along with all the public feedback that we received will be shared with the sound transit bored before they confirm or modify the alternative.",90,,
432,0.97,2762.893,2772.703,The meetings are live streamed and recordings are available on our Online open house.,90,,
433,0.97,2772.703,2788.685,"Finally, you'll see the expansion committee of the sound transit board will spend time on the draft and public comments late they are spring, leading up to the board in June we expect will confirm or modify the alternative.",90,,
434,0.97,2788.685,2798.896,Going a little bit more into our community engagement efforts and did you work the draft comment period I would first again NOTE our Online open house here.,91,,
435,0.97,2798.896,2799.83,You see the link.,91,,
436,0.97,2799.83,2814.111,"That Website is a great resource for information about the project, the draft EI s, station planning, the advisory group process, and provides public except.",91,,
437,0.97,2814.111,2819.95,It has been translated into multiple languages and is available 24/7.,91,,
438,0.97,2819.95,2821.518,Our community advisory groups are meeting.,91,,
439,0.97,2821.518,2825.756,They are four groups meeting monthly during May.,91,,
440,0.97,2825.756,2831.161,We'll have four virtual draft as I mentioned and one in person in March.,91,,
441,0.97,2831.161,2840.637,"During the virtual meetings the public can expect presentation, and an opportunity to provide public except.",91,,
442,0.97,2840.637,2846.343,"We'll also send out a draft Mailer to 130,000 addresses, again to build awareness about the project.",91,,
443,0.97,2846.343,2857.521,So all along the project corridor and extending further in Ballard and West Seattle and down the Dell ridge corridor to capture those that may connect to the station by bus or other modes.,91,,
444,0.97,2857.521,2870.934,"There are many other activities listed here that I just want to note, Clouding community briefings and events, fairs, festivals and I believing.",91,,
445,0.97,2870.934,2874.171,"Property owner Webinars, office hours, and then Muppet liaison outreach.",91,,
446,0.97,2874.171,2877.14,Which I wanted to spend a little bit more time on.,91,,
447,0.97,2877.14,2892.155,So we are Partnering with the at the of Seattle Department of neighborhoods community leads on program.,91,,
448,0.97,2892.155,2902.966,We have expanded this partnership and are engaging with 11 community liaisons that are focused on the station area as well as the Dell ridge corridor in West Seattle.,91,,
449,0.97,2902.966,2922.486,"The expanded effort kicked off last summer with six training sessions, engagement to a's awareness and establish relationships leading up to the public comment Periodch these liaisons are now focused on encouraging broad awareness and participation in the comment period, door-to-door business where helpful.",91,,
450,0.97,2922.486,2932.195,"I think maybe social media connections that they have tabling stations, uptown spaces, fairs and festival Ands interpretation at community meetings.",91,,
451,0.97,2932.195,2933.43,They provide so much more value than we put on the slide.,91,,
452,0.97,2933.43,2937.334,But I wanted to take a moment to note that as well.,91,,
453,0.97,2937.334,2954.051,"Then finally a variety of ways to provide a common, Online, phone, mail, E-mail, draft public meetings, and of course folks can comment in any language.",92,,
454,0.97,2954.051,2954.952,"Cahill, back to you.",92,,
455,0.97,2954.952,2959.823,So now I'll provide a brief overview of the draft results.,93,,
456,0.97,2959.823,2972.135,"Before Ium think into that, I did want to point out a couple of performance Metrics if you like for the project just to help you understand some of the larger objectives that we are trying to accomplish with this project.",93,,
457,0.97,2972.135,2978.342,This is a look at the Overall- pro correct corridor and speaks to travel times and the Reloyal.,93,,
458,0.97,2978.342,2986.917,These are by no means the only benefits of the project but it does highlight some of the factors.,93,,
459,0.97,2986.917,2990.687,It notes the connection from Westlake to Alaska junction.,93,,
460,0.97,2990.687,2996.727,"Without link would likely be a 30-minute trip, would be reduced to a 60 minute trip.",93,,
461,0.97,2996.727,3008.338,"You can see in terms of transit reliability, that would move the liability rating from a Deor testimony, to an a.",93,,
462,0.97,3008.338,3027.991,"Similarly for the connection from Westlake to Ballard and market street in Ballard, you would be changing a trip from 38 minutes or so noted there down to 11 minutes and again the transit re liability rating would go to an a rating.",93,,
463,0.97,3027.991,3034.931,As I noted up front there is a lot of information in the draft.,94,,
464,0.97,3034.931,3037.034,These are the topics typically studied.,94,,
465,0.97,3037.034,3053.35,There is many things that you know are described and I can possibly go through all of it today but I will be talking about some of the key considerations to help Orient you to perhaps some of the trade offices Differeniators between some of the alternatives on the corridor.,94,,
466,0.97,3053.35,3060.59,"So I'll start with the downtown segment, and then you can see I'll go through other segments along the corridor after that.",95,,
467,0.97,3060.59,3071.334,I'll crib the alternatives in each case and I'll talk about some of the key considerations associated with those alternatives.,95,,
468,0.97,3071.334,3071.935,Again starting with downtown.,95,,
469,0.97,3071.935,3074.771,This shows the alternatives that we have in the do you want area.,96,,
470,0.97,3074.771,3081.011,So you can see we have the in pink when we call the fifth if Harrison alternative.,96,,
471,0.97,3081.011,3090.22,That is because it goes along Harrison Avenue and transitions to Westlake and transitions over to Harrison.,96,,
472,0.97,3090.22,3094.891,"Ultimately, lands in Republican in Seattle center area.",96,,
473,0.97,3094.891,3102.032,You can see there high lied in the black text station locations and the Rectangles beside them.,96,,
474,0.97,3102.032,3107.404,"Stations at Midtown, Westlake, Denny, South Lake Union and Seattle center.",96,,
475,0.97,3107.404,3111.975,We also have blue alternatives there called the system alternative.,96,,
476,0.97,3111.975,3119.883,That is shorthand because it goes along sixth to Midtown then Terry Avenue through South Lake Union and on to Mercer.,96,,
477,0.97,3119.883,3124.654,And again the stations are pretty much very similar locations.,96,,
478,0.97,3124.654,3130.227,"Midtown, West lick, Denny, South Lake Union and Seattle center.",96,,
479,0.97,3130.227,3134.898,This is a quick Snapshot of some of the key considerations if you like between the alternatives.,97,,
480,0.97,3134.898,3135.832,So it is a table.,97,,
481,0.97,3135.832,3140.804,"You can see the pink fifth and Harrison alternative and the blue, sixth and Mercer.",97,,
482,0.97,3140.804,3151.948,"And along the left there, you see some key considerations, including project costs, residential and business so on down that police there.",97,,
483,0.97,3151.948,3153.45,Cable is shaded.,97,,
484,0.97,3153.45,3155.552,Color coded if you like.,97,,
485,0.97,3155.552,3156.453,Darker shading means higher performing.,97,,
486,0.97,3156.453,3159.523,You can see the legend in the about the right.,97,,
487,0.97,3159.523,3164.027,Darker is higher performing of the lighter means lower performing.,97,,
488,0.97,3164.027,3167.33,I won't go through this in a lot did he have tail.,97,,
489,0.97,3167.33,3179.476,"But if you can see the pink alternative it performs a little better in terms of project cost, residential, business, historic property effects and park effects.",97,,
490,0.97,3179.476,3183.613,Whereas the blue alternative performs better in terms of traffic effects.,97,,
491,0.97,3183.613,3187.317,Not others many roadways affected no also NOTE at the bottom here other considerations.,97,,
492,0.97,3187.317,3192.923,So we have highlighted a few other things that are notable between these alternatives.,97,,
493,0.97,3192.923,3203.199,"One of those is a construction ground noise effects, NOTE not guilty particular some of the sensitive uses in South Lake Union and Seattle center that would be affected by the alternatives.",97,,
494,0.97,3203.199,3211.541,It also notes disruption to streetcar operations during construction and that would be the case for either alternative.,97,,
495,0.97,3211.541,3214.711,Different locations but either alternative would affect streetcar operations during construction.,97,,
496,0.97,3214.711,3234.898,"At the last couple of bullets there note, the connections to adjacent segments, so for example, with the pink alternative, that alternative will connect to any of the alternatives in the chin town to the South, whereas the blue connects only to the shallow alternatives in the Chinatown Id.",98,,
497,0.97,3234.898,3241.104,"And similarly to the North, these alternatives have some limitations in Terps of what they connect to in the adjacent segment.",98,,
498,0.97,3241.104,3243.273,So that is the do you want segment.,98,,
499,0.97,3243.273,3245.609,I went through that very quickly.,98,,
500,0.97,3245.609,3254.117,"I'll move forward into the next segment to the North, which is the South interface segment.",98,,
501,0.97,3254.117,3254.918,Gun.,98,,
502,0.97,3254.918,3257.02,We have throw alternatives in this Segmentment.,98,,
503,0.97,3257.02,3263.126,The pink is known named the Gator Street station central inner Bay alternative.,98,,
504,0.97,3263.126,3270.3,We also have a in blue a prospect Street station central Interbay alternative.,98,,
505,0.97,3270.3,3272.335,And a prospect Street station 15th Avenue alternative.,98,,
506,0.97,3272.335,3276.673,You can see Callouts to where those alternatives are on this graphic.,98,,
507,0.97,3276.673,3279.876,They all have a station somewhere in the Smith Cove area.,98,,
508,0.97,3279.876,3297.794,"In the case of the blue that station is right adjacent to prospect street, whereas with the pink, it is a little further North, spanning Gator street just south of the magnolia bridge.",98,,
509,0.97,3297.794,3302.332,"Again, this summary table highlighting some of the key considerations for each alternative.",99,,
510,0.97,3302.332,3304.701,I won't go through all the numbers here obviously.,99,,
511,0.97,3304.701,3308.471,I'll just focus on some of the darker shaded higher performing areas.,99,,
512,0.97,3308.471,3318.948,"You can see for the pink alternative for example on the left, it performs higher in terms of project costs and performs higher in terms of boy Oh diversity effects in yellow.",99,,
513,0.97,3318.948,3331.094,"If you move right with the blue alternative on the right, you can see that the prospect Street station performs better in terms of residential Displacements.",99,,
514,0.97,3331.094,3333.096,And also performs better in terms of roadway effects.,99,,
515,0.97,3333.096,3345.241,"And in terms of other considerations at the bottom, I would NOTE both the alternatives on the right would be running adjacent to the Queen Anne hillside steep slopes.",99,,
516,0.97,3345.241,3350.98,So there are engineering construct built challenges associated with those alternatives.,99,,
517,0.97,3350.98,3358.555,"Moving to the Interbay Ballard segment f the project, with a number of alternatives in this area.",100,,
518,0.97,3358.555,3362.559,The pink alternative is the fertile turn of the elevated 14th Avenue alternative.,100,,
519,0.97,3362.559,3369.766,So it would be a high fixed bridge over the ship Canal with a station in Ballard spanning market street on 14th.,100,,
520,0.97,3369.766,3378.007,We also in Brown have a couple of tunnel alternatives on 14 and on 15th.,100,,
521,0.97,3378.007,3392.522,"The stations would either object 14th or 15th in Ballard and to the West of the existing about hard bridge, we also have a movable bridge alternative which we elevated 15th Avenue alternative I don't excuse me.",100,,
522,0.97,3392.522,3397.026,"Council member Morales, I believe has a comment or question.",100,,
523,0.97,3397.026,3397.66,So sorry.,101,,
524,0.97,3397.66,3398.061,Didn't see that.,101,,
525,0.97,3398.061,3410.54,"Well, I appreciate the previous slides where you are showing the different considerations that you have and how things rank based on those considerations.",102,,
526,0.97,3410.54,3424.354,But can you talk a little bit about whether local businesses are part of those considerations and how that is included in the consideration?,102,,
527,0.97,3424.354,3427.19,Yeah.,103,,
528,0.97,3427.19,3428.558,Let me see.,103,,
529,0.97,3428.558,3431.728,Perhaps go to an example.,103,,
530,0.97,3431.728,3431.928,Yeah.,103,,
531,0.97,3431.928,3442.071,"So, for example, in the downtown area, we do have, we have noted here in the third row the difference in business Displacements associated with these alternatives.",103,,
532,0.97,3442.071,3449.078,"Again this is just a quantitative measure, pure just number of businesses that would be potentially displaced by one alternative versus the other.",103,,
533,0.97,3449.078,3457.787,You can see in the downtown segment not a huge difference between the alternatives in terms of business Displacements.,103,,
534,0.97,3457.787,3465.895,There is a lot more information in the draft on when specific businesses are affected and what would be the effects to them in particular.,103,,
535,0.97,3465.895,3493.99,"So I would encourage anyone interested in that to refer to the draft EI so we don't always highlight business displacement in the other segments, because it isn't a significant difference and that is why sometimes it is not always mentioned in these summary slides.",103,,
536,0.97,3493.99,3500.196,So speaking to Intheir Bay Ballard segment I think I went through the alternatives here.,104,,
537,0.97,3500.196,3505.034,"No so again, a Snapshot of how these alternatives compare to each other.",104,,
538,0.97,3505.034,3509.672,"February, I'll just focus on the darker shaded areas for the sake of time.",104,,
539,0.97,3509.672,3516.246,"You can see there, in the middle ""the tunnel"" 14th alternative.",104,,
540,0.97,3516.246,3524.42,"Generally performs favorably in terms of project cost, as well as residential Displacements, historic property effects, employee Displacements and in water effects.",104,,
541,0.97,3524.42,3527.891,This had be a tunnel so it wouldn't have any what you are effects.,104,,
542,0.97,3527.891,3543.773,"You can see some of the other alternatives, the alternative to the right of that also performs well in terms of many measures apart from project cost and then over on the right there, you see the elevated 15th alternative forms quite well in terms of cost and residential Displacements.",104,,
543,0.97,3543.773,3545.942,There are a number of other considerations that are noted at the bottom here.,104,,
544,0.97,3545.942,3549.445,I think they are important to call out.,104,,
545,0.97,3549.445,3562.492,"Generally, with the elevated alternatives, the pink one on the left or the blue ones on the right, they will potentially have Maritime business Displacements associated with them, as well as other effects.",104,,
546,0.97,3562.492,3567.03,Example boat ramps or strong water that would be worth noting as well in those areas.,104,,
547,0.97,3567.03,3577.941,I think I'll leave it at that for now and move onto the next segment.,104,,
548,0.97,3577.941,3579.709,Moving to China town Id.,105,,
549,0.97,3579.709,3582.912,We have a number of alternatives in the Chinatown Id.,105,,
550,0.97,3582.912,3596.392,This is one area of the project where the board did not previously identify a preferred alternative so all these were studied I had in detail.,105,,
551,0.97,3596.392,3600.296,You can see a station potentially on fourth Avenue.,105,,
552,0.97,3600.296,3602.932,We label it fourth shallow or fourth deep.,105,,
553,0.97,3602.932,3606.069,Referring to the depth of the station.,105,,
554,0.97,3606.069,3606.369,Similarly.,105,,
555,0.97,3606.369,3610.106,We have a station that could be located on Fifth Avenue.,106,,
556,0.97,3610.106,3619.082,"Again, we have a fifth shallow and a fifth deep alternative and those labels are referring to the depth of the station at those locations.",106,,
557,0.97,3619.082,3634.364,Also in response to feedback during phase I developed a new alternative called a fifth shallow diagonal configuration born out of a desire to try to reduce the crux effects and traffic detours and so on in this area.,106,,
558,0.97,3634.364,3644.741,"It is a slightly different alignment, but station location the head house for the station would be basically the same location as the fifth shallow alternative.",106,,
559,0.97,3644.741,3656.319,"This is a very detailed table and a lot of it is to do with construction effects in Orange and that is really because construction effects was a key driver, key concern in this area with all the alternatives.",107,,
560,0.97,3656.319,3658.521,"So again, I won't go through the table in full.",107,,
561,0.97,3658.521,3662.992,But I will focus on some of the darker shaded areas.,107,,
562,0.97,3662.992,3668.865,So you can see moving the top anything terms of project cost.,107,,
563,0.97,3668.865,3676.305,"Fifth shallow, and diagonal alternatives, the third and fourth toward the middle and right of the table perform better in terms of cost.",107,,
564,0.97,3676.305,3686.749,"Moving down, not a lot of distinctions in terms of residential Dispolicements apart from the fourth shallow alternative having a number of Displacements associated with it.",107,,
565,0.97,3686.749,3696.893,"Business Displacements, you can see fourth shallow and fourth deep would have fewer.",107,,
566,0.97,3696.893,3701.464,So those are higher performing alternatives.,107,,
567,0.97,3701.464,3705.835,Dope stations would be elevator only.,107,,
568,0.97,3705.835,3706.335,That a consideration.,107,,
569,0.97,3706.335,3726.189,"To give you an idea, I think moving toward the right of this Gsk you see more darker shading, better performance in terms of this duration of the construction period being shorter, the number of detours of traffic, the effect on streetcar places and the effect on utilities and so on.",107,,
570,0.97,3726.189,3735.798,"There are notes at the bottom again Referencing how these alternatives can connect to other alternatives in a adjacent segments, I won't go through all those Permutations here for the sake of time.",107,,
571,0.97,3735.798,3762.492,"I would note, with the two alternatives to the left, the fourth shallow and the fourth deep, they do have effects to base in the case of fourth shallow, it would displace the riders and bus Foo moving South to the Soto segment.",107,,
572,0.97,3762.492,3766.929,We have four alternatives in section.,107,,
573,0.97,3766.929,3770.099,Top left you have an grade staggered configuration.,107,,
574,0.97,3770.099,3773.603,South station option and mixed profile option.,107,,
575,0.97,3773.603,3779.575,So as implied by the name the alternative is essentially grade within the existing Soto Busway.,107,,
576,0.97,3779.575,3785.248,It would be adjacent to the existing station at that location.,107,,
577,0.97,3785.248,3791.154,"And this would include Overpasses, which are noted here at Lander and at hole gate.",107,,
578,0.97,3791.154,3794.724,So today there are not Overpasses at those locations.,107,,
579,0.97,3794.724,3805.201,"The vehicle operations and rail operations will be separated from each other, so there would be no conflict between those two modes after the project is built.",107,,
580,0.97,3805.201,3808.171,That is the same for the stagger consideration.,107,,
581,0.97,3808.171,3813.209,The only difference here is the new station is staggered a little bit to the North.,107,,
582,0.97,3813.209,3816.813,Still possible transfer between lines essentially the same in terms of access.,107,,
583,0.97,3816.813,3824.487,"But the reason we stagger it there is this alternative would avoid I want packets to a Usps facility in that location, which would be difficult to relocate.",107,,
584,0.97,3824.487,3832.161,"And the top right here, we have an alternative called the South station option.",108,,
585,0.97,3832.161,3840.503,"The difference here is the new platform and the existing station would move South, closer to Lander street.",108,,
586,0.97,3840.503,3848.644,"And then Finally, the mixed profile alternative, this is a bit different in the sense that the station would be elevated.",109,,
587,0.97,3848.644,3851.48,Not at grade.,109,,
588,0.97,3851.48,3861.023,So there would be an elevated station Ajace sent to the existing at grade station and this alternative would not have an Overpass at Lappedder because the goad Bay would be elevated.,109,,
589,0.97,3861.023,3870.366,It would not be possible to have an Overcrossing of the light rail at that location.,109,,
590,0.97,3870.366,3875.938,It would still be an Overpass at hole gate street.,109,,
591,0.97,3875.938,3884.78,"Again, summary table, just focusing on the higher performing, the at grade stagger configuration performs higher in terms of project cost.",110,,
592,0.97,3884.78,3890.152,Not a lot of distinction between the alternatives in terms of business Displacements.,110,,
593,0.97,3890.152,3899.462,"In terms of effects, if you look to the right there you see the mixed pro fill alternative would result if a temporary closure of the Soto bus.",110,,
594,0.97,3899.462,3902.298,I mean for about 10 years.,110,,
595,0.97,3902.298,3907.803,But the other alternatives would result in permanent closure of the existing Busway.,110,,
596,0.97,3907.803,3924.287,"The mixed profile alternative on the right would result some night and weekend closures of land err street, and the others would result in a longer-term closure of Lander street.",110,,
597,0.97,3924.287,3948.411,"Noting the difference between alternatives in terms of grade separated crossings and it also notes the connections to the alternatives in the adjacent Ci Dsegment and notably, in the middle of the at grade stagger configuration, as I mentioned would avoid reelection of the existing Usps facility in that area.",110,,
598,0.97,3948.411,3950.413,"Moving to next, we have three alternatives in this gray.",111,,
599,0.97,3950.413,3965.261,"In the middle of this graphic, you can see the existing West Seattle bridge, East West crossing harbor Island, preferred alternative from phase I is just the pink line just to the South of that.",111,,
600,0.97,3965.261,3966.629,Labeled South crossing alternative.,111,,
601,0.97,3966.629,3972.201,Then we also have below that a blue line called a South edge crossing the Lynn.,111,,
602,0.97,3972.201,3975.905,Similar it would just cross harbor Island a bit further South.,111,,
603,0.97,3975.905,3982.745,Then we have a North crossing alternative on the North side of the existing West Seattle bridge.,112,,
604,0.97,3982.745,3983.612,These are all elevated bridges.,112,,
605,0.97,3983.612,3992.722,"But this one would be on the North side, crossing over Fort property.",112,,
606,0.97,3992.722,4000.196,"Again, quick summary of how these Kiro to each others, South crossing alternative would perform better in terms of project cost.",113,,
607,0.97,4000.196,4008.003,"And if you Scan down that column, you see it would have if Youer Maritime business Displacements than the other alternatives.",113,,
608,0.97,4008.003,4018.28,Then I think I would NOTE perhaps the alternative on the right the North crossing alternative would perform better in terms of residential Displacements and partial effects.,113,,
609,0.97,4018.28,4038.167,"In the bottom of this graphic under other considerations, you'll NOTE some of the things we need to deal with, pigeon point construct built challenges in that area and then on the right, I would note that North crossing alternative would impact port of Seattle facilities.",114,,
610,0.97,4038.167,4044.14,Cahill we have a question or comment from Council member Turnbull.,115,,
611,0.97,4044.14,4045.775,"Thanks, quick question.",116,,
612,0.97,4045.775,4057.286,Do all three of these crossing alternatives work with the different alternatives in Dell ridge?,116,,
613,0.97,4057.286,4057.52,Yes.,117,,
614,0.97,4057.52,4057.853,Thank you.,118,,
615,0.97,4057.853,4063.259,"So Finally, with the Dell region and West Seattle junction alternatives.",119,,
616,0.97,4063.259,4066.629,There are a lot of alternatives in West Seattle and Dell ridge.,119,,
617,0.97,4066.629,4072.101,Didn't screen down too many during the initial phase and indeed added some.,119,,
618,0.97,4072.101,4076.972,I deal with both together because they really do interact with each other.,119,,
619,0.97,4076.972,4083.212,What you decide to do in Dell ridge reflects what Ma you can do in the Alaska junction and Vice-Versa.,119,,
620,0.97,4083.212,4085.147,That is why I'm going through both together here.,119,,
621,0.97,4085.147,4106.969,"Starting on the left with the alternative in the Alaska junction area and the pink lines, the elevated alternatives, you can see we have a pink line labeled elevated Font LeRoy, and to the left of that, we have on the another pink alternative elevated 41, 42.",119,,
622,0.97,4106.969,4112.875,"Again the vicinity of Alaska treat but in the 41, 42 Street area.",119,,
623,0.97,4112.875,4124.186,"Then we have the brunt Alternativessing ""the tunnel"" alternatives we studied in phase I and it involves stations at either 41St or 42Nd.",120,,
624,0.97,4124.186,4139.869,"And then, in blue, are a couple of additional tunnel alternatives that we studied during the draft phase in response to the direction for the alternatives that would be more effective from a cost perspective and reduce effects.",120,,
625,0.97,4139.869,4142.571,Those are labeled short tunnel 41St and medium tunnel 41.,120,,
626,0.97,4142.571,4145.474,Referring to the length of those tunnels.,120,,
627,0.97,4145.474,4153.115,In both cases the tunnels the stations themselves would be on 41St.,120,,
628,0.97,4153.115,4160.523,"Moving to the right in the Dell ridge corridor, you'll Ahe see in pink a preferred alternative on Dakota street.",121,,
629,0.97,4160.523,4175.504,"So the alignment would be elevated, cross over there, and the vicinity of Dakota street, you would have the station and continue along Genesee street to connect one of the pink lines in the junction area.",121,,
630,0.97,4175.504,4180.943,We also have the possibility of going into a tunnel connecting with tunnel options in the junction.,121,,
631,0.97,4180.943,4185.247,You Cansee there just the Brown Yeah Brown Callout.,121,,
632,0.97,4185.247,4186.215,Dakota Street lower height alternative.,121,,
633,0.97,4186.215,4194.557,The station would be in the same location in Dell ridge but the guide way height would be lower and then connect to tunnel options in the junction.,121,,
634,0.97,4194.557,4199.094,"To the right of that, you see Dell Ridgeway, it is a blue alternative.",121,,
635,0.97,4199.094,4206.101,"So if that case, the station would be on Dell Ridgeway, spanning street in that location.",121,,
636,0.97,4206.101,4210.172,"And again, connecting to Genesee street, connecting to the alternative to the junction area.",121,,
637,0.97,4210.172,4216.245,And then the third station location in the Dell ridge area is up in the Andover Street area.,122,,
638,0.97,4216.245,4230.092,"And you can see that that would connect along Andover treat, and then could either go along Avalon way or adjacent to the West Seattle bridge On-Ramp area there.",122,,
639,0.97,4230.092,4238.534,And those are labeled Andover Street and Andover Street lower height alternatives.,122,,
640,0.97,4238.534,4244.173,"So briefly here, there is a lot of alternatives in the junction.",123,,
641,0.97,4244.173,4246.442,"And indeed, this doesn't represent all of the different combinations that you could have.",123,,
642,0.97,4246.442,4252.781,But it does give you a sense of how these alternatives compare to each other.,123,,
643,0.97,4252.781,4268.43,"So again, focusing on just the darker shaded areas for purposes of this conversation, in terms of project costs, you can see that the on the left here the pink elevated Font LeRoy Dakota Street does perform well in terms of project cost.",123,,
644,0.97,4268.43,4279.441,"On the right there, you see second from the right, the medium tunnel 41St, Andover Street lower height alternative also is comparable in terms of cost.",123,,
645,0.97,4279.441,4283.012,"And then to the right of that, elevated Font LeRoy Andover street.",123,,
646,0.97,4283.012,4289.184,"So you know, few alternatives there to compare to each other in terms of the cost measure.",123,,
647,0.97,4289.184,4294.69,Residential Displacements I think the one to focus on perhaps is to the right here.,124,,
648,0.97,4294.69,4299.128,Medium tunnel 41St performs high MER terms of residential Displacements.,124,,
649,0.97,4299.128,4303.932,"Business Displacements, a you be if of alternatives are comparable to each other there as well.",124,,
650,0.97,4303.932,4309.371,Sort of in the to mid 30 range for business Displacements.,124,,
651,0.97,4309.371,4313.909,"And then park effects, the Hoyer performing alternatives are the ones on the right there as well.",124,,
652,0.97,4313.909,4321.884,You can see both the medium tunnel 41St and elevated Font LeRoy would not impact parks.,124,,
653,0.97,4321.884,4327.856,"Other considerations and this is important, something I should highlight.",125,,
654,0.97,4327.856,4341.603,"You can see with the elevated alternatives, the pink on the right and you know the pink alternatives on the left rather and some of the alternatives on the right are elevated.",125,,
655,0.97,4341.603,4348.243,"If you are elevated in a junction, you would result generally speaking result in a taller guide way in Dell ridge area.",125,,
656,0.97,4348.243,4350.479,So that is something to be aware of.,125,,
657,0.97,4350.479,4359.922,"If you pick an elevated alternative in the junction, it does mean that you will have a higher guide way in the Dell ridge area start.",125,,
658,0.97,4359.922,4367.329,"Whereas if you pick a tunnel alternative in the junction, it will generally result in a lower guide way in the Dell ridge area as well.",125,,
659,0.97,4367.329,4371.233,There are some other things to note there.,126,,
660,0.97,4371.233,4379.942,"I won't go through these in detail, but you can look at those as well under the considerations note.",126,,
661,0.97,4379.942,4383.545,So next slide please.,127,,
662,0.97,4383.545,4385.414,Council member has a question.,128,,
663,0.97,4385.414,4411.273,This is about the content of the EI so one of the things I have been hearing from constituents is that evaluating the options that not all of them have clear visual representations in the draft EI so I'm wondering are there plans to provide Visuals?,129,,
664,0.97,4411.273,4421.583,"We did have our initial draft results overview with the West Seattle community advisory group just last week, I think it was.",130,,
665,0.97,4421.583,4426.021,It was an about in doing a deeper dive on visual.,130,,
666,0.97,4426.021,4434.263,"So at our Flexion community advisory group meeting in March, we'll be spending some time going through visual representatives of the alternatives.",130,,
667,0.97,4434.263,4445.474,"For folks interested in that topic, I would encourage them to tune into that next meeting where fantastic.",130,,
668,0.97,4445.474,4445.774,Thank you.,130,,
669,0.97,4445.774,4452.648,I think we can move to the next section and I'm going to hand it over to Sloan Dawson.,131,,
670,0.97,4452.648,4453.315,"Thank you, Cahill.",132,,
671,0.97,4453.315,4455.25,Can everyone hear me okay?,132,,
672,0.97,4455.25,4455.484,Great.,132,,
673,0.97,4455.484,4460.456,"It is an honor to be here with you today, Council members and chair Peterson.",132,,
674,0.97,4460.456,4467.196,I'm going to give a brief overview of our approach for station planning on this project.,132,,
675,0.97,4467.196,4475.704,"But not going Toett into all the details, because there is a lot out there and it is summarized in a report now available Online.",132,,
676,0.97,4475.704,4494.223,"But to start with, we are taking a different approach in the sound transit 3 program and really thinking very early on in the start of developing our light rail and transit project, to think about how the stations knit into the communities that they serve.",132,,
677,0.97,4494.223,4512.207,And this slide is sort of an Aspirational vision of what station planning can achieve when done in a timely way on really thinking out the location of the station and the positioning of entries in the urban Fab breaks that are highly accessible and visible.,132,,
678,0.97,4512.207,4518.38,"Thinking about those walking and Biking connections, making sure they are convenient and safe to access the station.",132,,
679,0.97,4518.38,4535.831,Of course working with our partners at King County Metro and cities on seamless integration between those modes of transit at the station since that is a big part of the sound transit strategy here to provide connecting service into the light rail network.,132,,
680,0.97,4535.831,4545.908,"And then at the site level, really thinking about the design of the immediate environment stations.",132,,
681,0.97,4545.908,4550.812,"The public spaces around the stations having great transit plazas, as well as opportunities to integrate with adjacent development.",132,,
682,0.97,4550.812,4554.95,So that is really what we are trying to achieve with station planning.,132,,
683,0.97,4554.95,4559.221,"And to do that, requires partnership.",133,,
684,0.97,4559.221,4568.33,And also acknowledgement that there are many actors with distinctive responsibilities within these larger station service areas.,133,,
685,0.97,4568.33,4580.042,"So this slide helps Orient us to sort that have nesting geography of response, if you will, and also the focus of our station planning program at sound transit.",133,,
686,0.97,4580.042,4582.678,That is really focused on the station context.,133,,
687,0.97,4582.678,4591.119,"About one to throw blocks surrounding the station, which will see the most direct physical change.",133,,
688,0.97,4591.119,4591.887,Station construction operations.,133,,
689,0.97,4591.887,4606.468,"As noted it is an area of shared responsibility, so it is Aiography that encompasses investments sound transit is making as well as investments made by others, in this case the city of Seattle, as well as Metro.",133,,
690,0.97,4606.468,4610.906,And of course third party developers and property owners.,133,,
691,0.97,4610.906,4630.926,"And ultimately, by engaging in this early planning around the station context, we hope to Co- create a vision that we can align existing and planned investments, both within sound transit, as well as with our partners, and service of community priorities and needs.",133,,
692,0.97,4630.926,4631.426,In the station graze.,133,,
693,0.97,4631.426,4637.966,"So to that end, we have created a Co-Planning partnership.",134,,
694,0.97,4637.966,4653.782,"We have been working regularly with Citi staff from multiple departments, on Seattle city light, and the list goes on.",134,,
695,0.97,4653.782,4655.984,To engage and evaluate these that Cahill mentioned.,134,,
696,0.97,4655.984,4663.358,So a little bit of a background as to how we got here and where we are going next.,135,,
697,0.97,4663.358,4668.797,This is that earlier Overall- pro correct Timeline slide that Cahill was speaking to.,135,,
698,0.97,4668.797,4680.709,"And the Emimagine at the about the of this is really speaking to the steps that we are going through now, in this early station context planning.",135,,
699,0.97,4680.709,4701.93,"We began with alternatives development in 2017 through 2019 on where we did studies, as well as on neighborhood forums throughout the corridor to identify station sites and line alternatives that were now informing conceptual locations that we have studied advanced design on for the draft.",135,,
700,0.97,4701.93,4731.827,"In parallel we have been working to develop draft station context urban design concepts and those are summarized in the draft report, which I'll have a slide on right after this, that we have released alongside the draft to help inform community conversations and decision making around, which station alternatives perform well with respect to urban integration and development potential, and accessibility.",135,,
701,0.97,4731.827,4758.053,"But ultimately, as we move from the draft EI s into the final EI s, we'll be working with communities, with our agency partners to refine the design concepts, and produce a final station context framework that we can really all work to design to and performing well and successfully.",135,,
702,0.97,4758.053,4758.42,Going forward.,135,,
703,0.97,4758.42,4758.587,,136,,
704,0.97,4758.587,4770.165,So this work is all summarized in a progress report station planning progress report that is available on our Online open house and on our Website.,137,,
705,0.97,4770.165,4800.562,"It summarizes ideas, recommendations, as well as presents the station concepts for all the alternatives studied in the draft EI so and it is really representing the ideas, feedback and recommendations that sound transit staff, as well as our great agency partner staff city of Seattle King County Metro have come up with as we have evaluated the station concepts and really focus on those key dimensions of station planning with respect to access.",137,,
706,0.97,4800.562,4817.746,"How people are getting to the station on transit, as well as on active modes, Biking and walking, as well as potential transit development concept and opportunities for public space and streets around the stations.",137,,
707,0.97,4817.746,4833.929,"So I encourage you to visit that report, there is a lot more information in detail on the station concepts.",138,,
708,0.97,4833.929,4834.229,Thank you.,138,,
709,0.97,4834.229,4834.996,"Back to you, Leta.",139,,
710,0.97,4834.996,4841.636,I can take this if you want and.,140,,
711,0.97,4841.636,4841.903,Yeah.,141,,
712,0.97,4841.903,4845.207,It is just a reminder of where we are in the process.,142,,
713,0.97,4845.207,4856.384,Just a highlight we are going through the public comment period leading to public hearings in March leading to ultimately going to system expansion Committee in the spring and the board hopefully in June.,142,,
714,0.97,4856.384,4860.188,Just a reminder about the process we described earlier.,142,,
715,0.97,4860.188,4871.099,I did want to emphasize noted earlier in response to a question the upcoming community advisory group meetings where we'll be doing a deeper drive on the results.,142,,
716,0.97,4871.099,4885.614,"If you missed the February community advisory group meetings or the January February meetings, they are all recorded, all available on the Online open house and I would recommend you look at them in January.",142,,
717,0.97,4885.614,4892.954,Stone went into a great deal of detail on the planning concept and all of that information is available from a recorded version of those presentations.,142,,
718,0.97,4892.954,4903.431,"And as mentioned earlier in February, we did an overview of the draft results so went into a good deal more detail than I went into today for each of the segments of the corridor.",142,,
719,0.97,4903.431,4908.87,"And then as noted here in March, we will be doing these deeper dive.",142,,
720,0.97,4908.87,4922.784,"When we presented the result to the community advisory group in February, they had questions, things they wanted to know more about and the intent of the Fedex round of these meetings is to try and circle back and provide more information to address some of those concerns.",142,,
721,0.97,4922.784,4932.127,"So you can see there the dates of our community advisory group on Tuesday March 1, 5-7.",142,,
722,0.97,4932.127,4937.532,"Downtown Mount advisory group Thursday March 3, they are all 5 to 7:00.",142,,
723,0.97,4937.532,4945.24,"West Seattle community group Tuesday March 1, and Soto community advisory group meeting on Tuesday March 10.",143,,
724,0.97,4945.24,4946.007,All live streamed.,143,,
725,0.97,4946.007,4956.384,If you can't make it you can check out the recording and access all these at the Online open link.,143,,
726,0.97,4956.384,4961.523,"On the final slide on the Online open house, Leta spoke to it earlier.",144,,
727,0.97,4961.523,4967.662,"This just kind of lays out, if you like, the various bits of information that are available.",144,,
728,0.97,4967.662,4973.068,"If you go to this site, again, it is translated into many different languages.",144,,
729,0.97,4973.068,4980.542,You can see tabs and the gray bands along the top there and those are the same noted in the bullets on the left side of this Gsk.,144,,
730,0.97,4980.542,4983.511,So you can get a project overview.,144,,
731,0.97,4983.511,4999.494,"You can get access to the draft EI s, you can comment on the draft EI s, you can go through all the station information kind of give a brief introduction to, check out the advisory groups and the Regardings of those.",144,,
732,0.97,4999.494,5021.216,"This information to property owners if you are potentially affected and finally and most importantly, get involved section featuring all the different ways that we are engaging if various forums beyond the regular draft EI s meetings any other meetings we were doing with many other ways to engage in the information if the draft EI S.",144,,
733,0.97,5021.216,5023.518,That concludes our presentation for today.,145,,
734,0.97,5023.518,5025.954,I'm happy to we are any questions.,145,,
735,0.97,5025.954,5026.688,,146,,
736,0.97,5026.688,5031.326,"Thank you very much for this excellent, thorough, clear presentation.",147,,
737,0.97,5031.326,5036.164,It is available on our Council agenda.,147,,
738,0.97,5036.164,5038.333,Sound transit's business sound transit's Website.,147,,
739,0.97,5038.333,5052.414,We are going to hear from Marshall foster and Sarah Max briefly but let's pause here for questions and comments from Council members.,147,,
740,0.97,5052.414,5053.415,I saw Council member Strauss.,147,,
741,0.97,5053.415,5055.917,"Cahill, Leta, so great to see you.",148,,
742,0.97,5055.917,5057.585,It has been so long.,148,,
743,0.97,5057.585,5060.221,Sloan Knight nice to meet you virtually here.,148,,
744,0.97,5060.221,5066.995,"Man, I'm so excited to be pack here talking about our favorite topic.",148,,
745,0.97,5066.995,5070.698,If we could pull up and pull back to slide 30.,148,,
746,0.97,5070.698,5076.171,I notice we didn't do it in a straight line.,148,,
747,0.97,5076.171,5085.046,So come back up to slide 3. I had some questions about here and Interbay.,148,,
748,0.97,5085.046,5093.488,"So the Ballard, first question here is have we been able to do, and I know you spoke a little bit to this.",148,,
749,0.97,5093.488,5095.857,But frame this more clearly.,148,,
750,0.97,5095.857,5104.899,What is the Curch status of the cost comparison between a high level tunnel or bridge and a tunnel?,148,,
751,0.97,5104.899,5105.233,I don't yes.,148,,
752,0.97,5105.233,5111.906,The next slide answers that directionally in the first row.,148,,
753,0.97,5111.906,5122.851,So you can see what the high level bridge on the left there cost range would be 1.5 to $1.6 billion range.,148,,
754,0.97,5122.851,5131.326,"You can see with the elevated alternatives on the right here, the blue, they would also be in a that same range.",148,,
755,0.97,5131.326,5138.032,"""the tunnel"" alternatives are in the middle of the graphic here.",148,,
756,0.97,5138.032,5140.435,"And ""the tunnel"" 14th alternative would also be about $1.5 billion.",148,,
757,0.97,5140.435,5145.64,"So comparable, if you like, to the elevated alternatives.",148,,
758,0.97,5145.64,5152.447,The tunnel 5th option in the middle will be a couple of hundred million dollars more expensive.,148,,
759,0.97,5152.447,5160.522,"So those are all updated estimates from you know, the prior estimates a couple of years ago.",148,,
760,0.97,5160.522,5169.564,Really appreciate you in this slid calling out the other factors that we need to exercise.,149,,
761,0.97,5169.564,5180.775,"As far as the engineering of the tunnel when we look at this, what cost drivers are there for the difference between 14th and 17th.",149,,
762,0.97,5180.775,5205.233,"Or we'll get to my next questions about 20th when we are locking at that range between 20th Avenue and 14th Avenue, separate and aside for the historic properties, residential displacement, when I'm just looking at building ""the tunnel,"" what are the cost drivers I need to be thinking about when I lock at the difference between 20th and 14th as the range?",149,,
763,0.97,5205.233,5209.904,"Yeah, well, in this Gsk, we just speak to 14th and 15th.",150,,
764,0.97,5209.904,5220.215,"Those are the two alternatives that are examined in the draft EI S. and as noted here, there is a difference between the cost of those two tunnel alternatives.",150,,
765,0.97,5220.215,5227.555,It is driven really by the depth of the tunnel and the need to mind the tail track in the 15th area.,150,,
766,0.97,5227.555,5239.867,"There is a few particular constraints associated with that, that drive the station deeper also require the tail tracks to be mined, which means the cost of that alternative is greater overall.",150,,
767,0.97,5239.867,5243.171,We have not looked at a 20th alignment in the draft EI S.,150,,
768,0.97,5243.171,5251.779,"That was something that was considered, you may recall in phase I. I know you were involved at that time.",150,,
769,0.97,5251.779,5269.33,"And was not moved forward at that time if a number of reasons, a lot to do with the length of the tunnel which drove the cost of that tunnel, as well as the impacts of the station location and the challenges of constructing it to the West.",150,,
770,0.97,5269.33,5272.1,So right now those alternatives further West were screened out.,150,,
771,0.97,5272.1,5282.076,"They were not looked at in the draft EI S. the two alternatives that are, are shown here in the middle of this graphic.",150,,
772,0.97,5282.076,5282.91,"Thank you, Cahill.",151,,
773,0.97,5282.91,5286.547,Let me take what I heard you just say and answer my own question.,151,,
774,0.97,5286.547,5288.416,Because I think it was really helpful.,151,,
775,0.97,5288.416,5292.353,And please add on to this list if I've missed any cost drivers.,151,,
776,0.97,5292.353,5296.891,"What I'm hearing is length of tunnel, depth of tunnel, and soil condition.",151,,
777,0.97,5296.891,5305.633,Are there other factors that I need to be thinking about when locking at constructing this tunnel here?,151,,
778,0.97,5305.633,5309.137,"Length, depth, two big cost drivers.",152,,
779,0.97,5309.137,5313.875,"And how you construct ""the tunnel"" is, or elements of the Tum, if you like.",152,,
780,0.97,5313.875,5320.214,"The particular issue in the 15th area which drives the cost is that, that area is Built-Up.",152,,
781,0.97,5320.214,5321.182,As you know.,152,,
782,0.97,5321.182,5323.017,There is some recent development in that area.,152,,
783,0.97,5323.017,5326.688,So it drives down the depth of the tunnel.,152,,
784,0.97,5326.688,5333.661,Because you have to avoid building foundations and so on in that area and you can only mine.,152,,
785,0.97,5333.661,5335.93,You can't do cut and offer in those locations.,152,,
786,0.97,5335.93,5337.231,That is a big cost driver.,152,,
787,0.97,5337.231,5350.244,"So maybe one of the unknowns is what future development will be taking police at 14th that might increase some of these costs and make it a more level comparison, would that be a fair assumption to make at this time in.",153,,
788,0.97,5350.244,5350.645,That is true.,154,,
789,0.97,5350.645,5360.521,The difference with the 14th tunnel as it is assigned right now is that it would be within the street Right-Of-Way.,154,,
790,0.97,5360.521,5370.465,"So there is a certain amount of I would say lessens the risk, if you like.",154,,
791,0.97,5370.465,5371.999,Compared to the 15th tunnel.,154,,
792,0.97,5371.999,5374.368,That is a risk if there.,154,,
793,0.97,5374.368,5375.269,But you are right.,154,,
794,0.97,5375.269,5387.882,Development is always a risk throughout the corridor and the impacts of building foundations and so on can drive up costs and that has been a factor as we have moved through project development.,154,,
795,0.97,5387.882,5394.088,Or I might even offer the 20th Street station might have other factors of publicly owned spaces that could be utilized.,155,,
796,0.97,5394.088,5414.776,"I think you might be sensing a theme here that I really would love us to be able to study the 20th street, just so that we have Anles to Anles comparison between 20 and the 14th, where the highest levels of density in the neighborhood, it would be helpful for me to understand those comparisons as we move forward.",155,,
797,0.97,5414.776,5416.144,"We don't have to do it now, clearly.",155,,
798,0.97,5416.144,5429.59,"But my next question is, we were looking at station placement and construction here in Ballard, what factors do we need to take into consideration at this time to ensure it operates well for the expansion?",156,,
799,0.97,5429.59,5437.198,"You know, Buzz I know at some point in the future, the train line will continue.",156,,
800,0.97,5437.198,5444.972,"You know I look at University of Washington, when I ride the train over there, the Stadium is called University of Washington station.",156,,
801,0.97,5444.972,5452.313,"And that was at the end of the line when it was created and yes, of course, the only station that goes to University of Washington.",156,,
802,0.97,5452.313,5461.789,But now here we are a number of years later where U district is unclear which one is actually closer to the University of wish awash.,156,,
803,0.97,5461.789,5470.031,"So you know, are a naming standpoint from that kind of bureaucratic standpoint, there is considerations.",156,,
804,0.97,5470.031,5474.001,But what I focus on here is what do I need to be thinking about?,156,,
805,0.97,5474.001,5488.349,"Do we need to have the station North South, East West no does it need to be at a certain depth or not a certainly depth to continue that tunnel in the future?",156,,
806,0.97,5488.349,5491.085,Our long-range plan does identify the potential extension to the North.,157,,
807,0.97,5491.085,5496.123,We have anticipated that could be something that would happen in the future.,157,,
808,0.97,5496.123,5497.358,And designed it as such.,157,,
809,0.97,5497.358,5505.399,But it is something we feed to keep designing and anticipating as well as we go through this process.,157,,
810,0.97,5505.399,5508.603,"But yes, there is not an s T-4.",157,,
811,0.97,5508.603,5512.807,"As you know, we do we try not to preclude that opportunity.",157,,
812,0.97,5512.807,5517.879,I don't I think that is the correct response from sound transit.,157,,
813,0.97,5517.879,5523.117,But as MOTT working for sound transit I'm going to be pushing for s T-4 hard and fast.,157,,
814,0.97,5523.117,5536.864,"Maybe when we met the next time I'll ask some of these questions again to get a better understanding of especially does ""the tunnel"" need to be North South for extension and expansion or some of those other questions about placement.",157,,
815,0.97,5536.864,5537.498,But I'll leave that now.,157,,
816,0.97,5537.498,5544.672,Just want to thank you all so great to see you.,157,,
817,0.97,5544.672,5553.714,I'll follow-up off line with more questions.,157,,
818,0.97,5553.714,5554.782,No Council member Morales?,157,,
819,0.97,5554.782,5555.983,"Good morning, everyone.",158,,
820,0.97,5555.983,5560.555,Thanks very much for this presentation and for the 60 page executive summary.,158,,
821,0.97,5560.555,5564.725,Still working month I way through that.,158,,
822,0.97,5564.725,5565.927,I'll be honest.,158,,
823,0.97,5565.927,5586.948,I first want to thank you for your explanation of the community liaison program and how you are using that program in our Department of neighborhoods especially to do outreach in the Id and to make sure folks are getting as much of this information as possible in language.,158,,
824,0.97,5586.948,5593.487,"This is a really technical document that we have, you know, fit if a government audience.",158,,
825,0.97,5593.487,5604.398,And I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit first about how you kind of turned this into digestible information for folks.,158,,
826,0.97,5604.398,5614.742,"You know, I think for the most part, people are really less interested in the technical side and more interested in like how am I going to get my Stroller off the platform if the elevator is broken?",158,,
827,0.97,5614.742,5622.984,Or will I be able to get a coffee when I get off the train?,158,,
828,0.97,5622.984,5623.384,On the platform?,158,,
829,0.97,5623.384,5637.198,"So can you talk first about how you are translating this, not just into other languages, but into something that his easier for folks to understand the implications of?",158,,
830,0.97,5637.198,5637.598,"Ia, thank you.",159,,
831,0.97,5637.598,5640.735,It is definitely something that is top of mind for us.,159,,
832,0.97,5640.735,5649.076,Especially if the community that we will serve with the project.,159,,
833,0.97,5649.076,5650.711,And to facilitate meaningful engagement in the process.,159,,
834,0.97,5650.711,5661.489,One thing we are doing in term of our materials just translate and go Transcreating as much as possible by engaging with the community and our community based organization partners early in the process.,159,,
835,0.97,5661.489,5667.928,We have been able to hear from them what are those kinds of questions that are really meaningful for community members?,159,,
836,0.97,5667.928,5673.3,Like what are the ones that will really matter to them?,159,,
837,0.97,5673.3,5677.905,We heard a lot about the construction of tracks and trying to understand those questions around access.,159,,
838,0.97,5677.905,5708.235,"The other theme that we have also reflected in term of our racial tool kit report Dr., sort of a consolidated place where it is a lot of information we have heard might be most powerful to community members that it is really about how we limit the harmful impacts and look at opportunities to identify, even building that sort of this partnership with our agency partners, how do we identify opportunities with the project to do that?",159,,
839,0.97,5708.235,5715.743,"Those are things we have heard as common themes, as well.",159,,
840,0.97,5715.743,5718.679,And maximizing those connections and supporting the community with the long-term vision.,159,,
841,0.97,5718.679,5740.701,"So with those kinds of questions with us and with many different ways and tables that we are set fog engagement providing additional Tech: resources and community resources in terms of translation, we are hoping that we can help folks really zero in on what matters most to them and get those kind of world series that will help them with the comments.",159,,
842,0.97,5740.701,5749.343,But it is definitely something very top of mind for us we have been talking with the city quite a bit about in terms of making sure folks can engage meaningfully.,159,,
843,0.97,5749.343,5749.877,I appreciate that.,160,,
844,0.97,5749.877,5759.186,"Approximate you know, part of why I asked is Buzz my office is starting to hear from folks in the Ci Dabout their preferred alternative.",160,,
845,0.97,5759.186,5768.496,"And after seeing the prep Tation, preferred alternative, I'm hearing about is not one of the ones that you know, performs best.",160,,
846,0.97,5768.496,5779.173,And so I probably will be asking to have a conversation with all of you about how we address that.,160,,
847,0.97,5779.173,5781.809,"Chair Peterson, I have a couple more questions.",160,,
848,0.97,5781.809,5784.912,I don't so thank you for that enter.,160,,
849,0.97,5784.912,5800.261,"I also wanted to talk about you know, as we are moving through these decisions, there are diversity of concerns and opinions and really diversity of needs in the different neighborhoods.",160,,
850,0.97,5800.261,5808.869,"You know, Ballard and the junction are all very different.",160,,
851,0.97,5808.869,5818.612,"So I'm wondering, and I'm particularly thinking about Soto.",160,,
852,0.97,5818.612,5825.219,"And you know, this industrial area, there is another separate EI s process going on, about our Maritime industrial lands.",160,,
853,0.97,5825.219,5874.568,"And so I wonder if you can talk a little bit about how future light rail stations will interact with surrounding industrial lands in I'm thinking about walk sheds, about the need for supporting pedestrian safety, bike infrastructure, especially as we contemplate the projections that you have for Ridership in the sort of growth in Ridership you would like to see, if we are talking about the industrial area, where there is freight and I uses going on there, I would like to hear a little bit about how you are balancing those seemingly Compoting demands and projections for how that will be used.",160,,
854,0.97,5874.568,5875.135,That pace will be used.,160,,
855,0.97,5875.135,5878.505,"I don't I might call on you to speak, stone.",160,,
856,0.97,5878.505,5885.346,A lot of the topics you touched on there is something that we have really speaks to our station planning effort in that area.,160,,
857,0.97,5885.346,5898.225,"And stone, perhaps you could Úsmoke to some of those details if you don't minute I don't absolutely.",160,,
858,0.97,5898.225,5899.126,"So, thanks for the question.",160,,
859,0.97,5899.126,5905.833,It is something we have been thinking about for the station planning material I was just presenting.,160,,
860,0.97,5905.833,5913.741,"The report contains chapters focused on all of the stations, looking at all the alternatives.",160,,
861,0.97,5913.741,5918.078,On and engages those themes directly.,160,,
862,0.97,5918.078,5920.848,"What are those approaches for folks walking, Biking to the station?",160,,
863,0.97,5920.848,5931.592,"And how might we, together with the city and with Metro, look at opportunities to make investments?",160,,
864,0.97,5931.592,5934.161,"To make that more Approachingable, safer, better experience?",160,,
865,0.97,5934.161,5957.451,"You know, obviously with so many alternatives to study, we haven't been able to develop very detailed sort of Ground- level renderings and perspectives thills trait those potential opportunities, but we have been able to really in that report, capture the idea and high lit the opportunity for those improvements.",160,,
866,0.97,5957.451,5981.241,"And of course in the trial lands, areas with Soto Interbay on Ballard Smith Cove, there is that additional layer of how do we ensure that whatever land use decisions and transportation decision investments the city makes complements the urban design and the potential of the stations to serve those areas.",160,,
867,0.97,5981.241,6010.704,"So we have highlighted opportunities for integrated joint development and adjacent transit Orient development, and of course you know, with whenever in the future we hear from city related policy decisions that will influence the direction the character, et cetera, of those development opportunities I don't I see Marshall has his hand raised.",160,,
868,0.97,6010.704,6016.143,"Which was perfect, because we are getting to our interface zones between sound transit and the cities.",160,,
869,0.97,6016.143,6021.015,"Marshall, please go ahead to we are for Council member more Rlsa.",161,,
870,0.97,6021.015,6027.221,"I'm glad you are here as the designated representative, Repping all the departments.",161,,
871,0.97,6027.221,6030.157,This really gets into the access and integration of the built environment.,161,,
872,0.97,6030.157,6031.525,"So please, go ahead.",161,,
873,0.97,6031.525,6033.694,"I don't thank you very much, chair.",161,,
874,0.97,6033.694,6036.597,Council members it is great to to be with you.,161,,
875,0.97,6036.597,6046.907,And also want to respect Mize Sarah I are who is our sound transit program lead at Sdot.,161,,
876,0.97,6046.907,6072.366,"I wanted to take the opportunity to just you know, emphasize how much in addition to the conversations that we'll be having through this Committee and obviously the critical work we are doing in the Mount to help lift up voices and also to frankly intern and help make this document digestible, the city team is in the middle of a very extensive review and analysis of the document.",161,,
877,0.97,6072.366,6096.29,"And one of the major questions and aspects that we are working on is the land use you know, Imications of some of the station locations and how to best think about it.",161,,
878,0.97,6096.29,6099.66,There is a very complicated kind of crosswalk between those issues.,161,,
879,0.97,6099.66,6121.014,I want to give a Shoutout the team with Sloan and others at sound transit has been extremely collaborative in doing the station complex framework work and I think there is a pretty good foundation of understanding that is shared in Terps of how to think about those decisions in the best way.,161,,
880,0.97,6121.014,6156.55,"And frankly, as you know, council member Peterson laid out in an E-mail to us, as departments last woke, we really want to use this committee as a Co-Venue, to be able to, you know, share some of that analysis with you and start to, our hope is we can come to really a shared picture, as a city, for what our feedback to sound transit should be the environmental document and we are glad to have a chance, I think we are expecting it you know, in earnest in April, to really be able to look at those issues In- depth.",161,,
881,0.97,6156.55,6158.385,"So key issues, more work underway.",161,,
882,0.97,6158.385,6167.094,I'm excited we have a solid city team and city effort underway to Startframing up those decisions.,161,,
883,0.97,6167.094,6167.461,Thank you.,162,,
884,0.97,6167.461,6168.295,I appreciate that.,162,,
885,0.97,6168.295,6168.829,I'll fence up.,162,,
886,0.97,6168.829,6180.274,"I just want to say I do think it is important as we have got these two separate processes happening, we have you know, projections for population growth, for job growth across the city.",162,,
887,0.97,6180.274,6190.117,And we need to keep in mind what that means for people's ability to get around to and from these stations safely.,162,,
888,0.97,6190.117,6201.695,"And I really appreciate the conversation about the station area context and from sound transit's perspective, that means you know, 1 to 3 blocks away.",162,,
889,0.97,6201.695,6242.069,"So you know, and the shared responsibility that we will all have to make sure that people can get where they need to go you know, in, as we are, I am observing the park station going in and all of the thousands of units of housing going in up and down Rainier Avenue, I'm really mindful of what that means for pedestrian safety getting to the station, and the need for us to be very thoughtful about not just building housing, although we all know how important that is in the city.",162,,
890,0.97,6242.069,6247.307,"But really making health any, safe neighborhoods and that gets us to the goal of having vibrant communities.",162,,
891,0.97,6247.307,6249.91,"So I appreciate Mowing that you are thinking about that, too.",162,,
892,0.97,6249.91,6269.663,"And going about the projections that we have as a city, threading all of those together so that we are billing healthy neighborhoods is going to be our task for the next 20 years.",162,,
893,0.97,6269.663,6270.33,Thank you.,162,,
894,0.97,6270.33,6270.831,Appreciate your time.,162,,
895,0.97,6270.831,6277.404,We have our own city document central staff senior analyst Calvin Chao.,163,,
896,0.97,6277.404,6278.138,Thank you.,164,,
897,0.97,6278.138,6278.538,Council members.,164,,
898,0.97,6278.538,6292.486,"I guess I wanted to emphasize for everyone that this is a long process of screening the environmental review, Council was engaged in this a couple of years ago as part of the elected leadership group and it continues after this.",164,,
899,0.97,6292.486,6299.326,"Each you know, this is really about trying to get the major themes of our review the environmental work.",164,,
900,0.97,6299.326,6302.929,Sound transit will have to response to all those comments.,164,,
901,0.97,6302.929,6312.039,They are also doing additional cost savings and refinement work that will be brought forward to make a recommendation ultimately to the board.,164,,
902,0.97,6312.039,6320.947,At least for the environmental process to get that bought off by the FDA and a record decision that defines what the mandatory requirements of the project are.,164,,
903,0.97,6320.947,6331.324,So I think it is just really important for us to be focused on what the city's main themes and concerns are.,164,,
904,0.97,6331.324,6335.529,And that will inform sort of the the city's comments on it.,164,,
905,0.97,6335.529,6351.111,"But to also recognize that the decision making process will go on into the summer and into the next year as the environmental process COMPLETES, it is important for us to kind of remember that we are still in this narrowing process.",164,,
906,0.97,6351.111,6372.999,"Thank you, Cal no and we will be bringing sound transit back to our Committee in April and everybody, all the Council members have a direct line of communication to sound transit and really just want to emphasize the District city council members know their districts best and should be viewed as leaders and resources in their district.",165,,
907,0.97,6372.999,6378.872,As decisions are being made and community input is being provided.,165,,
908,0.97,6378.872,6410.103,"We are really fortunate to have Marshall for the and Sarah Max sort of bringing together the executive Department so that we can make sure we are providing adequate access and integration into the built environment, and having the city speak as a unified voice to the extent we and a big picture, while being supportive implementing this successfully, so with that, if there are no more comments, we will, again, invite sound transit back.",165,,
909,0.97,6410.103,6414.474,I want to thank sound transit for putting together this presentation.,165,,
910,0.97,6414.474,6428.121,"It is a real resource to the community to have this power point presentation and all those links and know how to engage with sound transit, with their District Council members and with the city executive.",165,,
911,0.97,6428.121,6431.458,And also our board members.,165,,
912,0.97,6431.458,6433.46,"So thank you, everybody.",165,,
913,0.97,6433.46,6433.827,Appreciate it.,165,,
914,0.97,6433.827,6442.002,"It was a very efficient presentation, and very thorough and we will be contacting you later with additional input.",165,,
915,0.97,6442.002,6445.205,"And we'll see you back in April, as well.",165,,
916,0.97,6445.205,6446.807,All right.,166,,
917,0.97,6446.807,6447.607,Well thank you.,166,,
918,0.97,6447.607,6452.746,"This concludes the February 15, 2022 meeting of the transportation Seattle public utilities committee.",166,,
919,0.97,6452.746,6455.615,"We anticipate our next meeting will be on Tuesday, March 1. we are adjourned.",166,,
920,0.97,6455.615,6455.849,Thank you.,166,,
