11,0.97,49.082,61.394,In this meeting we will discuss with the media introduce to stop having fossil fuels like the pipeline.,7,,
12,0.97,61.394,74.073,After years of organizing direct action and voting the climate movement the keystone excel pipeline is defeated which is a major victory for the climate movement.,7,,
13,0.97,74.073,87.42,The fossil fuel corporation abandoned this project because activists and organizers were forced to abandon this because activists and organizers made the completion so difficult from every angle that big business decided to cut their Losts.,7,,
14,0.97,87.42,101.367,We want to use this strategy of blocking the corporate profit by applying to every proposed expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure from Keystone excel to the support access by going to line three.,7,,
15,0.97,101.367,119.486,We have to be clear that while the billionaire costs will be forced to take measures and we will see that in the coming years both for their own profit under pressure from mass resistance it has been and will be a day late and a dollar short.,7,,
16,0.97,119.486,140.273,"To have any hope of doing this for the planet we are paying attention to the data from scientists we need the working class to take the fossil fuels and other sectors to democratic ownership and shift into a global Socialist economy powered by clean, renewable energy.",7,,
17,0.97,140.273,174.507,Organizing such as to end the excel pipeline and to stop the pipeline campaign are crucial for steps being taken by determined activists and my Council office is proud to be organizing with them and I am happy to be talking to them and this will be among the Union and the fossil fuel sector with the whole labor movement in solidarity to demand transition and retraining for all of the workers in the fossil fuel economy into the clean renewable energy.,7,,
18,0.97,174.507,186.252,Last Friday community organizers from my office joined activists presenting today that organized a protest painting a mural outside of liberty mutual in resistance to the pipeline.,7,,
19,0.97,186.252,190.557,"The beautiful mural said ensure our future, not our cents.",7,,
20,0.97,190.557,194.327,This demonstration in Seattle was part of our day of Act.,7,,
21,0.97,194.327,199.966,All around the world in solidarity with land defenders fighting this pipeline.,7,,
22,0.97,199.966,224.057,With the help of city council staff my office in developing legislation to give the green new deal oversight the legal authority to rate insurance companies and other financial institutions who bid on city contracts to enable the city of Seattle to join International movement pledging not to do business with financial institutions backing the fossil fuel corporation that are endangering all of humanity.,7,,
23,0.97,224.057,244.177,The committee will next discuss and vote on seven executive Mayoral appointments to the new oversight board after today the majority of the vote will have been appointed and we will still have one more Mail-In appointment and a couple of Council appointments to make it our next committee meeting.,7,,
24,0.97,244.177,284.384,After the appointments the committee will discuss several Representer rights bills from my office focused on rent increases so we have just voted on the Council and bills for Eviction protections and we need that bills that protect people from resident increases and we need strong rent controls and corporate landlords have raise the rents 13% in the last five months and we will discuss not discuss in detail but just have an overview of frequency and ask questions and our FAQ that we have prepared from my office to the harmful loop holes in rent controls from other cities.,7,,
25,0.97,284.384,316.049,Finally today's committee will have a briefing from our city council staff about legislation from my office to require landlords to require six months notice for rent increases and to require landlords to provide relocation assistance when they displace the tenants with outrageous increases that is known as economic Evictions in other words this bill is economic Eviction assistance to be paid by landlords that economically Evict their tenants.,7,,
26,0.97,316.049,336.769,So today's discussion of both of those bills will be an initial one so members can ask questions to understand what is being proposed and it is the intention of my office to then bring those bills for a vote in the committee in the subsequent to meetings in July.,7,,
27,0.97,336.769,349.482,Because it is the last Tuesday of each month it will follow the meeting in August will fall during the city council Recess and again in September it will fall during the budget starting around mid September.,7,,
28,0.97,349.482,360.493,So essentially if we do not schedule a special meeting time the July meeting will be the last committee meeting of the year that will absolutely not be sufficient to discuss and vote on the legislation.,7,,
29,0.97,360.493,368.801,This committee needs to address this here and so my office will reach out to committee members to schedule some special meeting times.,7,,
30,0.97,368.801,382.582,I'm hoping that we can have a special meeting in July and also find a special meeting time in September before the budget process begins.,7,,
31,0.97,382.582,392.925,For today's meeting I Councilmember Juarez can't stay past 2:30 and I appreciate that and I have my time constraints because of many other Council office obligations.,7,,
32,0.97,392.925,400.333,So I will request Presenters in today's meeting to be concise and we will of course come back to a discussion and the legislation will be discussed.,7,,
33,0.97,400.333,404.504,All of the legislation will be discussed further before being voted on.,7,,
34,0.97,404.504,414.547,Before we begin our agenda items we of course have public comment.,7,,
35,0.97,414.547,431.364,I will make sure my office has been ready to start public comments and do you have the Ãšlist of names for the public comments sign up?,7,,
36,0.97,431.364,439.705,There are four people signed up for public comment but only one is listed as present right now which is Cory brewer.,8,,
37,0.97,439.705,451.517,Please go ahead Cory brewer if you are muted go ahead and speak.,9,,
38,0.97,451.517,460.793,Getting to the Unmute button.,10,,
39,0.97,460.793,467.533,Okay hit Star 6 and you can begin.,10,,
40,0.97,467.533,468.1,Can you hear me?,11,,
41,0.97,468.1,470.703,Yes.,12,,
42,0.97,470.703,472.104,Great.,13,,
43,0.97,472.104,473.306,Just here to listen today.,13,,
44,0.97,473.306,473.94,That's all.,14,,
45,0.97,473.94,479.278,Just listen to what you are cooking up next.,14,,
46,0.97,479.278,485.084,To just confirm the other people were signed up for public comments showing people present?,15,,
47,0.97,485.084,485.318,No.,16,,
48,0.97,485.318,492.058,There are no other people that are showing up as present who are signed up for public comment.,16,,
49,0.97,492.058,492.458,Thank you.,17,,
50,0.97,492.458,505.004,"So seeing that none of the other people have signed up, are showing up as present I will close public comment and note that Councilmember Morales has joined the committee, thank you so much.",17,,
51,0.97,505.004,524.29,"With that being said, our first agenda item as I mentioned is a discussion about the movement demanding that insurance companies and other financial institutions end their backing of new fossil fuel infrastructure and destroying the climate and endangering all of humanity.",18,,
52,0.97,524.29,548.481,In 2017 many will remember my office demanded the city stop banking with Wells Fargo because of their investment in fossil fuel infrastructure and ultimately we passed an ordinance called the socially ordinance requiring the administrative services a fiasco to the Department that ARRANGES them with banks and insurance companies to consider the bank it does business with.,18,,
53,0.97,548.481,574.774,Unfortunately at that time we did not have a city body capable of renewing the fossil fuel investments of financial institutions and now that the city is forming the green new oversight and proposing legislation to empower this oversight board to raise insurance companies and other financial institutions to bid on city of Seattle contract and require FAS to factor in that ranking.,18,,
54,0.97,574.774,582.515,Our goal is to create a structure where Seattle can join stop the money pipeline movement in a real way.,18,,
55,0.97,582.515,586.752,To put pressure on insurance companies like liberty mutual to stop ensuring pipe lines.,18,,
56,0.97,586.752,614.78,The business they will lose from Seattle if they refuse to stop their ties with fossil fuels is part of the pressure that movement can put but if we have a moment building approach then we can make sure that it is not OM the city of Seattle but inspire other cities and States and universities to join the movement like we did after the socially banking responsible ordinance.,18,,
57,0.97,614.78,636.268,For today's presentation we are joined by Rachel Heaton and the green new deal Oversite board and selections from the Rainforest action network.,18,,
58,0.97,636.268,647.279,Speakers please introduce yourself and begin your presentation.,18,,

63,0.97,705.604,709.241,"Ted, if you have the slide show.",21,,
64,0.97,709.241,724.19,"Yes, we are excited to talk and present about--to present today on the insurance company angle to fighting the climb crisis.",21,,
65,0.97,724.19,734.333,We are at all hands on deck at seeking out any angle we can to fight this climate crisis.,21,,
66,0.97,734.333,741.273,"We did introductions, Ted, so you can go ahead and skip that.",21,,
67,0.97,741.273,743.409,Chris could not be here today.,21,,
68,0.97,743.409,755.754,Chris was also part in helping to develop some of this proposed legislation but he is taking some time with his family and could not be here today.,21,,
69,0.97,755.754,758.057,Just wanted to make sure he gets in the record.,21,,
70,0.97,758.057,760.893,We will go ahead and get started with Rachel.,21,,
71,0.97,760.893,769.468,She will go to the next slide and let you know when to go to the next slide.,21,,
72,0.97,769.468,769.769,Thank you.,21,,
73,0.97,769.769,783.282,So our purpose is global leadership is needed to accelerate a just transition from fossil fuels system to clean economy to respect clean indigenous rights.,22,,
74,0.97,783.282,784.65,What is the problem?,22,,
75,0.97,784.65,791.624,The problem is that the climate crisis is intensifying and we are not moving quickly enough to prevent the worse impacts.,22,,
76,0.97,791.624,796.529,We have seen unprecedented droughts.,22,,
77,0.97,796.529,798.063,We have seen temperatures rising upwards.,22,,
78,0.97,798.063,798.697,We keep seeing of 120 degrees.,22,,
79,0.97,798.697,817.616,Fairen height and we are seeing that is going to be a potential this year and intensifying super storms and sea level rise and Wildfire destruction.,22,,
80,0.97,817.616,820.452,Ocean acid fiction and endangered Northwest salmon and Orca.,22,,
81,0.97,820.452,825.758,Go ahead and go to the next one.,22,,
82,0.97,825.758,863.429,When we are talking about these issues we are not talking about the impacts happening to the people that live off of these lands and utilize the lands which is why it is so important to have indigenous voices in this and you will also hear a little bit from matt talking more about free informed consent and what that means in the solution of removing ourselves from these companies such as liberty mutual.,22,,
83,0.97,863.429,865.798,The climate climate is intensifying.,22,,
84,0.97,865.798,876.976,Canada and the U.S. is the leader exporters of fossil fuels and new infrastructure proposed to expands global oil and gas production.,22,,
85,0.97,876.976,887.853,Indigenous people and front line communities pay the highest price and the losing opportunity to hold climate changes to 1.5 degrees Celius according to the Paris accord.,22,,
86,0.97,887.853,895.828,So one of the other issues when we talk about these impacts also is there is other issues that come along this.,22,,
87,0.97,895.828,916.782,"When we talk about the violation of indigenous rights, it is not just the issues from the climate but it is also the result of these companies that are coming through tribal lands and so when we talk about missing and murdered indigenous women and how that is tied to the fossil fuels industry.",22,,
88,0.97,916.782,937.503,In the past we were working with the divestment solution this is kind of the next step because as long as these pipe lines are ensured we will continue to suffer these impacts that are ultimately leading to--ultimately the destruction of mother earth.,22,,
89,0.97,937.503,944.51,So when we talk about local connections the Transmountain pipeline expansion is a major one.,22,,
90,0.97,944.51,946.812,It is larger than the keystone pipeline.,22,,
91,0.97,946.812,951.717,It is also Tar sands that is the Dirtiest oil on earth.,22,,
92,0.97,951.717,955.354,No clean-up technology from Marine spills.,22,,
93,0.97,955.354,961.994,700% increase in oil tankers through the sale U.S. sea and the Puget sound refinery.,22,,
94,0.97,961.994,974.073,As native person from here on these lands on the Saleou seas that has a direct impact to our cultural practices.,22,,
95,0.97,974.073,991.69,Our canoes go out on the waters and we are not able at certain times of the year where we are not able to put our canoes in the water and that is due to Spillage and things that are already going into the Puget sound.,22,,
96,0.97,991.69,1004.403,"When we talk about the increase, 700% that is bigger impact on our fishing and harvesting that takes place on these waters.",22,,
97,0.97,1004.403,1015.014,"So it is not just a climate impact, it is also an impact to the first two native people of these lands as we do live directly.",22,,
98,0.97,1015.014,1016.148,We harvest off of these lands.,22,,
99,0.97,1016.148,1025.557,And so those are additional pieces that fall in to that.,22,,
100,0.97,1025.557,1036.902,"Also another local impact of these pipe lines to the climate changes and the destruction of Unseated first nation's territory in D.C. again, treaty fishing rights at risk.",22,,
101,0.97,1036.902,1041.473,Orca and salmon recovery efforts are a question.,22,,
102,0.97,1041.473,1051.884,Local Shellfish industry threatened by ocean Acidification and destruction of sea level structures.,22,,
103,0.97,1051.884,1059.091,And over here we have a quote from fawn shark that is also on tribal Council.,22,,
104,0.97,1059.091,1068.934,They have had to evacuate two blocks of tribal citizens from their homes and jail and Courthouses and community and the only store in town and this is due to rising ocean waters.,22,,
105,0.97,1068.934,1077.843,So these issues that we are talking about and that we are discussing is important in the way that--they are already Impacting communities.,22,,
106,0.97,1077.843,1084.349,Not a matter if we don't do this this is going to happen.,22,,
107,0.97,1084.349,1086.185,It is already happening.,22,,
108,0.97,1086.185,1110.442,"So more than ever by us presenting to you and here in this city of Seattle, we are leader in this war and people do look to what we are doing and so this is another opportunity for us to be leaders in that and so with that, I am going to go ahead and pass it on to matt to go ahead to the next part of the presentation.",22,,
109,0.97,1110.442,1112.878,"Thank you, Rachel.",23,,
110,0.97,1112.878,1116.148,She is absolutely right.,23,,
111,0.97,1116.148,1149.448,Seattle is looked to by many communities around the country and in some cases around the world for our kind of cutting edge leading strategies to addressing issues such as Council crisis and as Councilmember Sawant brought up in the opening we have exciting new opportunity to with the establishment of the green new deal oversight board that we can go into later.,23,,
112,0.97,1149.448,1152.851,We are looking for a climb leadership opportunity.,23,,
113,0.97,1152.851,1171.537,"We know just like the banks, the insurance company is the key Lynchpin in the fight against fossil fuels and coal mines, et cetera need insurance to build and operate the projects.",23,,
114,0.97,1171.537,1191.823,And insurance companies it should be pointed out both provide direct investment and underwriting of these projects so divestment from climate damaging projects is the best way to stop this.,23,,
115,0.97,1191.823,1195.294,We have seen this in examples around the globe.,23,,
116,0.97,1195.294,1219.818,"There is a global coalition under the banner of insure our future, it is not just folks here in Seattle, Northwest or even North America but folk from literally around the world that are targeting insurance companies for their role in climb crisis so the rough break down there is 26 companies with coal policies.",23,,
117,0.97,1219.818,1227.326,"13 companies with other policies and in major risk to Tar and coal, sand industries.",23,,
118,0.97,1227.326,1237.202,"We have actually seen a handful of local municipalities take leadership, including Paris, San Francisco, boulder County.",23,,
119,0.97,1237.202,1245.477,"Los Angeles, Summerville and Cambridge and in a little bit we can dive into what they accomplish there.",23,,
120,0.97,1245.477,1250.249,We can go ahead.,23,,
121,0.97,1250.249,1251.25,Next slide.,23,,
122,0.97,1251.25,1262.494,One of the key demands to insurers and coming from a global coalition tribes.,23,,
123,0.97,1262.494,1291.556,"Indigenous communities and grassroots and front line folks to insure projects, for those that are unfamiliar with f pick as it is mentioned and it is a specific right that pertains to indigenous people that is recognized in the United Nations declaration rights of indigenous people.",23,,
124,0.97,1291.556,1302.968,It you allows them to withhold consent to a project that may affect their territories.,23,,
125,0.97,1302.968,1347.079,As obviously members know but I like to engage in any project I like to go to local tribes or tribal Leaderships to see if they have interest or support particular legislation and before coming to city council I first went down to the Calla tribe and worked with Councilmember Anna beam down there and drafted up a resolution to bring to the National Congress of American Indians that is a body comprised of several hundred tribal nation governments that advocate for tribal nation interest.,23,,
126,0.97,1347.079,1355.32,Resolution 2036 that was passed last fall and I can provide a link to that resolution but it essentially calls on the U.S.,23,,
127,0.97,1355.32,1368.867,Insurance industries to adopt policies to ensure that projects that they have insured have obtained consent of tribal nations and that passed last fall.,23,,
128,0.97,1368.867,1416.348,"That was followed up with a conversation with the Washington state office of insurance Commissioner, with the three of us here and the President of the National Congress of American Indians fawn shark and the Snoqualmie tribe and he met with them and they came out with a statement to call on insurance companies to develop epic policies with tribal nations and he supports future state legislation to enforce, to determine what risks and insurer may Underright as it relates to f pick.",23,,
129,0.97,1416.348,1428.226,Not only is it global coalition for activist folks but led by tribal nations.,23,,
130,0.97,1428.226,1428.76,"Next slide, Ted.",23,,
131,0.97,1428.76,1451.149,We have seen up to the United Nations they have provided leadership in calling for divestment and you can read the statement from the Secretary General.,23,,
132,0.97,1451.149,1455.053,At this point we will go to more specific legislation and what this proposed legislation will do.,23,,
133,0.97,1455.053,1458.256,Thank you matt and thank you Rachel.,24,,
134,0.97,1458.256,1465.53,Councilmember Sawant spoke to us already but just to share photos.,24,,
135,0.97,1465.53,1468.834,This is act in downtown Seattle outside of liberty office on Friday.,24,,
136,0.97,1468.834,1475.207,Part of this global week of action as the pipeline attempts to insure insurance coverage for the coming here.,24,,
137,0.97,1475.207,1492.257,"All over the world indigenous people and communities and climate activists called on remaining insurers, 14 companies have ruled it out and a number of big U.S. companies remain.",24,,
138,0.97,1492.257,1495.794,"There were actions in Vancouver, Seattle, London, New York.",24,,
139,0.97,1495.794,1513.078,U Ganda and Berlin and here in Seattle there were Rainforest action network and sunrise Seattle and the future coalition came together to paint this giant mural urging liberty mutual to take action.,24,,
140,0.97,1513.078,1524.923,This is one strategy that we are getting out in the streets and calling for action and coming together.,24,,
141,0.97,1524.923,1529.895,As citizens urging insurers to address this and address the climate crisis.,24,,
142,0.97,1529.895,1541.573,Why we are here today is to think about the institution of these insurance companies and look at the leverage they have.,24,,
143,0.97,1541.573,1548.847,Cities are adding their voice to the growing call to take action.,24,,
144,0.97,1548.847,1550.715,"Go ahead, Ted.",24,,
145,0.97,1550.715,1551.049,Sounds good.,24,,
146,0.97,1551.049,1568.867,Operating for insurance companies that have restricted fossil fuel investments and insurance business is a logical step for the city of Seattle to align the procurement of financial services with its carbon emissions goal except all sections of government.,24,,
147,0.97,1568.867,1590.889,"So this list here is some of the city of Seattle and those big players insuring many fossil fuel projects Transmountain and others, Chubb and a I Gand liberty and all big insurers of oil and gas more broadly.",24,,
148,0.97,1590.889,1609.541,So as significant purchasers of Com commercial insurance there can be a powerful message to the insurance industry to demand that insurers stop this and fossil fuels projects and local companies have leverage.,24,,
149,0.97,1609.541,1620.018,Annual contract renewals and that is the moment where they--the city decides who they will go with and this happens once a year for most policies.,24,,
150,0.97,1620.018,1628.76,And they present regular opportunities to bring demands to insurers and provide deadlines.,24,,
151,0.97,1628.76,1642.073,There is increasing insurance companies that have made commitments and adopted policies around fossil fuels and carbon reduction targets as matt showed earlier.,24,,
152,0.97,1642.073,1650.682,And so cities have choices safer for the climate and choices that are respecting indigenous rights.,24,,
153,0.97,1650.682,1657.389,So on the next slide I can see kind of the policy legislation that we are here to talk about.,24,,
154,0.97,1657.389,1683.982,So basically the goal is for the city to formalize Racining process for insurance providers based on their fossil fuel and indigenous rights policies that give presence wherever possible for insurers that have committed to stop ensuring Underinvesting in fossil fools and tough policies in place.,24,,
155,0.97,1683.982,1692.123,Passing a policy like this would send an important message to the insurance industry and other Stakeholders that we need to shift away from fossil fuels to a zero carbon economy.,24,,
156,0.97,1692.123,1705.37,"And the more that insurance companies hear from customers and their big customers like the city of Seattle which BUYS all types of insurance, from automobile insurance to general liability to flood insurance.",24,,
157,0.97,1705.37,1707.205,All sorts of things.,24,,
158,0.97,1707.205,1714.345,Send a powerful message to the companies and calls on them to act.,24,,
159,0.97,1714.345,1761.359,So as Councilmember Sawant says the legislation is being developed but here is a little bit kind of more to explain the idea would be to kind of put in this kind of screening for insurance companies and have due diligent committees to evaluate insurers and rights policies and that is a place where the green new oversight board can come in and support on the due diligence and accountability and support implementation and allow for flexibility when there is no other options when the city Seattle has to go and has to Prioritize contracts with those insurers that are adopting stronger policies.,24,,
160,0.97,1761.359,1763.228,And follows fuel and indigenous rights.,24,,
161,0.97,1763.228,1766.03,I think one more slide.,24,,
162,0.97,1766.03,1810.675,"I think others have touched on this already and just to say again this is important because of city of Seattle spends a lot of money each year on insurance policies and we can, vote with our dollars and elect to support those companies that are taking stronger action but it builds on the momentum from the policies that we have seen from other cities and would set a model and standard for other cities, towns and counties and businesses and organizations to file suit on and demonstrate you can have a insurance policy to climb action and Manags risks in the ways that the city needs to.",24,,
163,0.97,1810.675,1820.618,It is complex and stands in solidarity with first nation's tribal government and front line communities.,24,,
164,0.97,1820.618,1831.296,Thank you and I think that is all and I will hand it back over to Councilmember.,24,,
165,0.97,1831.296,1838.803,Thank you matt and Rachel and Sulakshana.,25,,
166,0.97,1838.803,1845.81,We will have more specifics to share with the committee members once staff has made the progress.,25,,
167,0.97,1845.81,1889.12,Just want to note very quickly just from your presentation and as you said when the insurance companies and major financial institutions have large customers and puts their companies at stake there is an important point at which the movement needs to strike and I wanted to draw out the contrast with that and Completedly different idea of life tile for nearly 15 or 20 years.,25,,
168,0.97,1889.12,1925.857,Especially more well off people in the West starting to think and this was a point that was exploited by corporations and instead of the green washing like you as an individual.,25,,
169,0.97,1925.857,1928.226,An ordinary person and well off person in the West changes the way you live your life and recycle and compost more.,25,,
170,0.97,1928.226,1987.251,"I don't want to give you the impression that was more important but if a small segment of humanity did that, we know it has not happened and what we have seen since the Paris climate accord was signed in 2015 that is quite good but just since then that there was expanding of fossil fuels by four trillion dollars and without having a strategy to block the corporate profits in the fossil fuels structure there is no real solution to the climate crisis and I want to draw how important it is that the pipeline is targeting the question of major contributors to the financial sector so it is not only the city of Seattle but other institutions like big universities.",25,,
171,0.97,1987.251,1998.162,"If you have a moment, maybe you can highlight what universities we are talking about, maybe the University of Washington and other big institutions as well.",25,,
172,0.97,1998.162,2016.647,If you want to address that and I have Councilmember Morales that has raised her hand so go ahead.,25,,
173,0.97,2016.647,2020.151,"This movement and procurement, we have slowly talked to universities.",26,,
174,0.97,2020.151,2027.458,There is no commitment but a broader fossil fuels divest many has swept across the U.S.,26,,
175,0.97,2027.458,2037.902,And the globe moving billions of dollars out of fossil fuels investments and into kind of getting more sustainable clean energy economy solutions.,26,,
176,0.97,2037.902,2056.888,One thing to say here on that point is going--University endowment by endowment is certainly powerful and has built a really strong movement and I'm a climate activist that came out of that movement and lots of us out there.,26,,
177,0.97,2056.888,2072.904,But we need to know we need to take on the bigger corporate pillars like Wall Street and insurance companies that have trillions of dollars in these industries beyond the smaller pools of University money.,26,,
178,0.97,2072.904,2073.971,Absolutely.,27,,
179,0.97,2073.971,2077.208,It has to be on the skill of trillions of dollars.,27,,
180,0.97,2077.208,2084.549,That is extremely important.,27,,
181,0.97,2084.549,2086.017,Go ahead Councilmember Morales.,27,,
182,0.97,2086.017,2088.152,Thanks everyone for this presentation.,28,,
183,0.97,2088.152,2089.72,I wonder if you could talk a little bit.,28,,
184,0.97,2089.72,2099.53,There is several cities that you highlight as implementing their own procurement policies and I'm sure that we can get copies that we may try to model our own on.,28,,
185,0.97,2099.53,2119.35,Can you talk about the impact of those changes and whether it resulted in them finding new insurance companies in their communities or if the ones that they were working with actually made some changes to the way that they operated.,28,,
186,0.97,2119.35,2124.388,I can take that and Rachel feel free to jump in.,29,,
187,0.97,2124.388,2125.756,It is a relatively new movement.,29,,
188,0.97,2125.756,2130.661,The Los Angeles resolution that I mentioned was passed two months ago.,29,,
189,0.97,2130.661,2134.232,Both of the counties was last year.,29,,
190,0.97,2134.232,2136.868,"San Francisco, I believe, Yeah, a bit more than a year ago.",29,,
191,0.97,2136.868,2148.779,We are in the early stages and seeing how they are playing out.,29,,
192,0.97,2148.779,2163.561,But we know that they have engage the in productive conversation with legislation and why have we adopted it and what are we looking from you?,29,,
193,0.97,2163.561,2173.704,And my understanding that there is starting to be shifting and Prioritization that has moved some of their contracts in light of that.,29,,
194,0.97,2173.704,2181.646,I don't have the details now but definitely folk we can connect to and get answers from and I will pass it over to matt.,29,,
195,0.97,2181.646,2208.272,I was going to add that since some of them are so recent that many of the contracts haven't coming up yet for renewal so beyond those initial conversations that selection was talking about we will kind of see here in the next few months or so what is going to happen.,30,,
196,0.97,2208.272,2209.84,Thank you both for responding to that.,31,,
197,0.97,2209.84,2215.513,Are there any other questions from committee members?,31,,

199,0.97,2222.753,2234.398,"Matt, Rachel and Sulakshana we will have you back to discuss the legislation and talk with you much more but in closing did you have any comments?",31,,

201,0.97,2249.28,2264.929,The only thing that I would add is make Seattle even potentially more exciting in terms of possibilities where we can go for the legislation with the green new oversight board.,32,,
202,0.97,2264.929,2276.207,"I believe we would be the first to have that sort of power, I guess, lack of better word in engaging with the contract.",32,,
203,0.97,2276.207,2277.608,Look forward to that.,32,,

312,0.97,3349.446,3352.749,Each generation must develop its mission.,48,,
313,0.97,3352.749,3370.333,I wanted to share as youth representative I think for the first time for my generating and for our generation it is quite clear with the mission is to address the climate crisis and de Carbonize our society and advance the goals as quickly as we can.,48,,
314,0.97,3370.333,3417.113,I think it was brought up quite clearly in the presentation today how simultaneously the Paris accord is insufficient to address the needs that we have to address around de Carbonization and not only insufficient we are failing to meet the goals set out there in 2015 and things like this oversight board and the work that myself and Dennis are doing like the ECO district is important to Galvanizes the community and excited to how we use the oversight board at the city level and invent new programs and to provide extra impetus behind the community project and programs that are happening to advance the goals.,48,,
315,0.97,3417.113,3418.214,Thank you.,48,,

318,0.97,3426.489,3438.001,We hear at the office of environment are excited to be officially starting this work internally and build on the community organizing work that has happened throughout the year.,49,,
319,0.97,3438.001,3450.613,"So with that, I don't know if we have an opportunity to ask questions from the Council or if there is any other comments that new members would like to make.",49,,
320,0.97,3450.613,3459.622,I had some comments but I wanted to give you opportunity to ask the appointees.,50,,
321,0.97,3459.622,3466.83,Would you like to add anything to what Jose has said already?,50,,

323,0.97,3467.33,3481.144,"All for agreeing to serve on this board as Cyprus has said, sort of towards the end.",51,,
324,0.97,3481.144,3512.141,The question of climb crisis and the fact that your appointment or potential appointment are following from the very important presentation that we just had related to how actually fighting to address the climb crisis that could be full blown catastrophe.,51,,
325,0.97,3512.141,3543.506,"It will not be done by one city, it has to be all out international effort and it will not be diverted unless the Union movement and the battalion to the working class are getting organized and that is why it is important, the profile of the oversight board as we are seeing from various aspects including labor and communities of color.",51,,
326,0.97,3543.506,3584.881,I think so much of this is important important because we have to bill that solidarity and so much is at stake and especially because I am grateful you have served to agree and no question that you will take your role seriously and I want to thank you all I know many of you in terms of having worked along you all on various efforts for our city.,51,,

329,0.97,3645.341,3656.686,"And Dennis I appreciate you mentioning the struggle and Renter rights go a long way for climate justice because affordable housing, the Affordability crisis is so acute.",51,,
330,0.97,3656.686,3661.19,People are being pushed to the far reaches of the city and outside the city.,51,,
331,0.97,3661.19,3680.743,In fact so much of the trade workers have told me they build the buildings in the city and they Electrify them and many can't afford it and this is part of climate justice as well.,51,,
332,0.97,3680.743,3683.379,So thank you for mentioning the portion of Renters.,51,,
333,0.97,3683.379,3697.794,It is inspiring example of how working class examples can get push back and as we know many have fought that battle were actually tenants of color in indigenous communities.,51,,
334,0.97,3697.794,3715.578,I want to open this up for the committee members if you wanted to ask questions or make comments and also the appointees want to make comments you are most welcome to.,51,,

351,0.97,3808.938,3810.673,Councilmember Juarez.,62,,
352,0.97,3810.673,3812.742,Yes.,63,,
353,0.97,3812.742,3816.312,Councilmember Pederson.,64,,
354,0.97,3816.312,3816.546,Yes.,65,,
355,0.97,3816.546,3817.079,Councilmember Lewis.,66,,
356,0.97,3817.079,3817.547,Four in favor.,67,,
357,0.97,3817.547,3827.857,"Thank you, Ted and thank you committee members for engaging on this item and thank you all appointees.",68,,
358,0.97,3827.857,3842.638,The appointments will move to the city council for the final vote and I have no doubt that it will go through and be sure to tell your fellow members congratulations on your new contract.,68,,
359,0.97,3842.638,3847.643,And thank you all so much and looking to the work of the green deal oversight work.,68,,
360,0.97,3847.643,3852.782,This will be of tremendous consequence.,68,,
361,0.97,3852.782,3853.149,Appreciate it.,68,,
362,0.97,3853.149,3885.982,"Our next agenda item is a short point that I wanted to use for committee members and the public access to as I said questions, FAQ about rent control that my office has developed that hopefully will be of use in order to clarify a lot of the frequently asked questions about rent control and obviously we won't have time to fully go over this.",68,,
363,0.97,3885.982,3895.658,We will bring this up in upcoming committee meetings but I wanted to have a quick overview.,68,,
364,0.97,3895.658,3896.058,Before that.,68,,
365,0.97,3896.058,3896.425,I'm sorry.,68,,
366,0.97,3896.425,3908.237,I wanted to go over the Renter bills of rights that gives a good overview of where we are and where we are hoping to go.,68,,
367,0.97,3908.237,3922.852,I know that is hard to read but I wanted to make sure that our committee members were able to see what we have done so far and what is coming up in terms of our Renters bills of rights.,68,,
368,0.97,3922.852,3923.819,As the bill of rights shows.,68,,
369,0.97,3923.819,3934.697,And again this is something that my office prepared and shared a press conference that we did in May when we revealed our bill.,68,,
370,0.97,3934.697,3940.77,As you can see rent control is just based on statistical analysis.,68,,
371,0.97,3940.77,3976.238,We know it will be a flagship demand that Renters need to win to bring it about and given that skyrocketing rent is the major problem that we face in addressing the lack of housing Affordability and as it States we have residential rent control and without the loophole that is important to emphasize and I will come to that in a second and commercial Ren control without corporate loop holes to help struggling businesses.,68,,
372,0.97,3976.238,3994.657,This is important to highlight not only in generally but always a necessity but we can see unprecedented battering that small businesses have taken in the wake of the pandemic and the recession period that we saw in the preceding year.,68,,
373,0.97,3994.657,4003.165,We are making sure that we pass rent control for small businesses is crucial as well.,68,,
374,0.97,4003.165,4008.871,"And, of course, Overarching question is the question of debt.",68,,
375,0.97,4008.871,4066.095,Enormous amounts of debt has been accumulated by Renters because of the preexisting and this is business as usual under capitalism that people that yet the profits for the billionaire as multi millionaire don't have a small cushion that was brought forward more dramatically because of the Covid crisis and we--there is no real solution for the debt accumulated unless a State-Wide and nationwide rebuild mass movement to cancel the debt because the organizations and all those that have made it despite the pandemic.,68,,
376,0.97,4066.095,4077.74,Billionaires became a trillion dollars more richer during the crisis and this includes more Renters and homeowners and small businesses that are struggling to survive.,68,,
377,0.97,4077.74,4114.844,"As this bill indicates the next two things, the six month in this and requiring landlords for assistance assistance is something they will discuss and we will come back to it in the next committee meeting and the next two that you see the just cause in the loophole the city council passed these bills and they are strong bills without the Loop holes that could have gone through and thanks to the Renters themselves that got organized so it is important to do that.",68,,
378,0.97,4114.844,4183.979,"And thank you Councilmember Morales for working with the office on the just cause bill and thank you Councilmember Lewis to cosponsor that and thank to the city council as a whole for passing that and when we won the rights to Council and the rights for all Renters to have the right to a lawyer, when we talked about that, we also talked about how the Evictions that have happened and we need legislation for that and in the last three items are items that have also been highlighted by the city of Seattle Renters Commission in making sure that way Renters are able to interact with landlords should make it easier so banning the use of credit checks that is a new form or modern form of red lining we need to make sure histories are transferable and that we have standards that landlords will set up and that are for working class Renters.",68,,
379,0.97,4183.979,4201.931,Want to give everybody an overview of that and very quickly go over the rent control that you can share that screen with all of us on the zoom.,68,,
380,0.97,4201.931,4202.231,Thank you.,68,,
381,0.97,4202.231,4218.147,So this is available Online and wanted to make sure that public access it and I would welcome community members and let me know if you would like to propose any thing to it and there are updates.,68,,
382,0.97,4218.147,4219.915,We are updating as we go.,68,,
383,0.97,4219.915,4255.918,Just today my staff updated it to make sure we have new Statistics from April and may that we have for the situation faced by Renters and profits that corporate landlords have made and I want to draw your attention to some of the aspects we don't have time to go over all of it but I wanted to talk about the question that we often encounter because this is what corporate media and corporate landlords raise.,68,,
384,0.97,4255.918,4287.483,Isn't it all about supply and demand when rents come down by building more units and we have a political and moral obligation to clarify and I speak as economist myself there is zero data to show that simply increasing supply without paying any attention to whether the units are actually affordable to the people are not is no solution for the Affordability crisis and no magical amount of supply that will solve the problem.,68,,
385,0.97,4287.483,4313.609,What we have seen in the last ten years that Seattle is in fact the construction capital for three years running in very recent period and during that time there was construction boom and yet housing was less affordable and not more affordable and that is why fighting for Renter rights is crucial and rent control is going to be the standard bearer of Renter rights.,68,,
386,0.97,4313.609,4325.654,We know we need to push back and this talks about why the landlord lobby opposes it because it works.,68,,
387,0.97,4325.654,4332.728,The Ren control bill we are bringing forward says that rents can increase.,68,,
388,0.97,4332.728,4344.873,They won't be frozen but they will be allowed to increase as for the inflation rent and not absorb rent increases like most are experiencing.,68,,
389,0.97,4344.873,4358.52,So many Renters that have informed the office that they have gone up 80% and more than one hundred percent.,68,,
390,0.97,4358.52,4365.26,Just incredible and obviously wages are not going up and they should be tied to the inflation rates.,68,,
391,0.97,4365.26,4379.441,That is only fair and what we are talking about in terms of working for Renters we know that the corporate landlords will oppose that because it eats to their profits.,68,,
392,0.97,4379.441,4392.921,We should make a point that for small landlords that don't prize Gouge their Renters they have nothing to fear from rent controls.,68,,
393,0.97,4392.921,4401.764,Many small landlords have said they don't increase their represent by 10 or 15%.,68,,
394,0.97,4401.764,4412.908,As long as Renters are now Gauging Renters that rent control would not matter to them.,68,,
395,0.97,4412.908,4424.353,Some landlords have said this won have an impact on how they carry out their work with tenants because they charge less than inflation rates.,68,,
396,0.97,4424.353,4430.192,So I think this is important.,68,,
397,0.97,4430.192,4455.017,The pipeline is well refuted Website that talks about the housing question and talk about how the rule is simple and it pays for everything as far as landlords are concerned and it follows that land Lores will be extremely they will be fighting us tooth afternoon nail and all of history shows that Renters will get organized and fight that.,68,,
398,0.97,4455.017,4468.497,One last thing I wanted to go over before we go on to our two legislation that we are going over that is the--two points.,68,,
399,0.97,4468.497,4471.433,One is rent control is banned by Washington state legislation.,68,,
400,0.97,4471.433,4504.433,That is what we are discussing is legislation that we are going to affect as soon as the ban is lifted so nothing illegal about the bill that we have with the committee will have in front of it and been reviewed by the office and we should note that the rent control ban was itself put in place and now this is now 0 years ago and put in place because it was a vicious response to rent control movement at that time.,68,,
401,0.97,4504.433,4524.486,The rent control ban was not an act of God but a retaliation for movement and it will take a movement to overturn it and passing a rent control bill in Seattle will be a major component because winning the bill will take a major fight back and this is the last point.,68,,
402,0.97,4524.486,4541.77,How did Ren control cause rents to sky rockets in cities like San Francisco and we see similar claims about rent control in New York and a lot more to discuss but we should understand what the data shows.,68,,
403,0.97,4541.77,4607.736,"Everything that I am sharing here is backed up by this particular analysis by economists that show with the corporate loop holes and we want to avoid them but even with those corporate loop holes rent control has been a lifelong for working class Representers whatever has been passed and in are it can be made stronger without the Loop holes and they were not put in place by Renters or people that did not know what they are doing but put in place, those were put in place by politicians doing the bidding that wanted the Loop holes to be weaker and one is caused for vacancy control that allows landlords to raise the rents in rental units once it is vacated by the previous tenant and problematic and Underminds the rent control and we want to make sure that rent control is passed and this city does not have loop holes like that.",68,,
404,0.97,4607.736,4615.944,I want to go over the rest of the Loop holes and many that we need to avoid.,68,,
405,0.97,4615.944,4641.036,"Appreciate the Committee on this and now in the interest of time, we should move to our legislative discussion on the two bills that are coming up sooner than rent control that is the Economics Eviction and the six month notice for rent increases.",68,,
406,0.97,4641.036,4656.785,Next we will hear from city council staff about the legislation to pay relocation assistance when landlords have outrageous increases and similar ones have been passed such as in the state of Oregon.,68,,
407,0.97,4656.785,4682.244,In Seattle landlords need to pay relocation assistance to the relocation assistance when they Evict the tenants to Demolish or Redevelop the property but there are no programs to help Renters because of rent increases.,68,,
408,0.97,4682.244,4685.814,It doesn't matter what your former landlord wants to do with the property.,68,,
409,0.97,4685.814,4700.228,If you are forced to leave your relocation costs are the same whether the landlord is Demolishing the building or renting it out.,68,,
410,0.97,4700.228,4713.108,That's why this bill makes sense and the draft bill that we are proposing is not such an expansion of this and defined under state law.,68,,
411,0.97,4713.108,4728.924,"For example, it requires people to make less than 50% of the median income and calculates the area median income of everyone living in the apartment together.",68,,
412,0.97,4728.924,4736.598,If you have a room made with a better salary it becomes important.,68,,
413,0.97,4736.598,4745.874,So many increasingly young people are forced to rent in group houses and so it is important that we need to make sure we address that.,68,,
414,0.97,4745.874,4759.921,This legislation addressing economic Evictions and the and the displacement of rent increases.,68,,
415,0.97,4759.921,4770.065,We will have the details of the bill and there will be how there is divided up and all of that is important.,68,,
416,0.97,4770.065,4778.74,I want to highlight the general point of what this relocation does.,68,,
417,0.97,4778.74,4785.947,Renters are available for relocation assistance if the rent is increased by 10% in a year.,68,,
418,0.97,4785.947,4789.518,If the landlord does not raise it so dramatically that this law does not apply.,68,,
419,0.97,4789.518,4795.423,If the Renter can afford the new Ren and does not move this law does not apply.,68,,
420,0.97,4795.423,4804.666,It applies when the landlord RAISES the rent by 10% percent or more and the Renter has been forced to move because of that Ren increase.,68,,
421,0.97,4804.666,4833.061,When the Renter is economically evicted the landlord must pay them through the inspection for three month rent to help the Rentter costs and security deposit and we are available to answer questions.,68,,
422,0.97,4833.061,4837.832,I will turn it over to Asha Venkataraman.,68,,
423,0.97,4837.832,4838.266,Good afternoon.,69,,
424,0.97,4838.266,4841.903,Asha Venkataraman with central staff.,69,,
425,0.97,4841.903,4855.717,I will share my screen to a presentation on the agenda.,69,,
426,0.97,4863.458,4865.894,Just a moment.,69,,
427,0.97,4865.894,4866.127,Okay.,69,,
428,0.97,4866.127,4871.733,We are talking about a draft of the assistance bill.,69,,
429,0.97,4871.733,4883.378,What I will do is talk about the in tent and the projected time line and diabetes into the details of the bill and the potential staffing impact.,69,,
430,0.97,4883.378,4889.718,The in tent is to help the tenant that can't afford an increase of 10% or more relocate.,69,,
431,0.97,4889.718,4905.233,So if they can pay the rent and have to move out giving them mon NA tear assistance to support the first month rent and the costs that come with trying to find a new place to live.,69,,
432,0.97,4905.233,4922.817,"In terms of time line, we are working with the city attorney's office at the moment to get to a draft ready for introduction in July so the in tent is to talk about the introduced bill at the committee's next meeting.",69,,
433,0.97,4922.817,4924.185,At the end of July.,69,,
434,0.97,4924.185,4946.408,There are--pause we have been working on this bill for several years in draft form and a variety of things that need to be updated or corrected and so the introduced draft will take care of them and I will mention them substantively as I go to the bill.,69,,
435,0.97,4946.408,4953.915,The details this is for tenants to relocate because they can afford to pray the Ren increase over 10% or more.,69,,
436,0.97,4953.915,4963.792,"In the bill itself there is several definitions of who it is, not definitions but who is eligible for receiving relocation assistance.",69,,
437,0.97,4963.792,4964.826,There is two major elements.,69,,
438,0.97,4964.826,4978.473,The first that is they have to receive 60 day notice of rest increase and that is for 10% or more and plan to vacated the property or have already vacated the property.,69,,
439,0.97,4978.473,4991.753,Tenants have to provide notice to the owner if they are not going to continue the ten Nancy and plan on moving and and if they issue that notice that makes them eligible for this relocation assistance.,69,,
440,0.97,4991.753,5001.696,One thing that I will mention is that you will see in the draft in the definition section the definition of the required rent increase notice.,69,,
441,0.97,5001.696,5021.983,Because we have been drafting this for several years that doesn't take in to account the change in law that happened in 2019 and so that--back in in 19 it was 30 days notice.,69,,
442,0.97,5021.983,5040.335,The laws changed since that time and so now the required notice for any rent increase and it is to 60 days and that correction will be made.,69,,
443,0.97,5040.335,5051.78,As part of the ability to apply for relocation assistance one of the challenges is trying to figure out who it is that is eligible receive assistance.,69,,
444,0.97,5051.78,5077.739,The household can be large and we will get to the details of the different types of households and the proposal is household representative that would be responsible for doing the application and legally entitled to receiving the assistance and the Houseds could go from there in their interact with the household representative in terms of who gets how much funding.,69,,
445,0.97,5077.739,5083.078,To make sure there is no conflict of interest.,69,,
446,0.97,5083.078,5086.381,The households can represent one household at a time.,69,,
447,0.97,5086.381,5090.718,Moving to the definition piece.,70,,
448,0.97,5090.718,5095.824,A household defined as--any family household or Nonfamily household that is occupying a housing unit.,70,,
449,0.97,5095.824,5102.664,This is to account for some of the Dynamics of combinations of people that live together.,70,,
450,0.97,5102.664,5125.487,"So some circumstances in one housing unit you could have a family so family household on the next slide is defined as all occupants members of the same family unit and that family unit is described as I have laid out here, parents and spouses and grandparents and all of the variety of relationships.",70,,
451,0.97,5125.487,5128.79,But there is also circumstances in which it is not just a family.,70,,
452,0.97,5128.79,5141.736,"So they are living with another roommate or another couple that don't qualify for the definition of family, household, those persons are defined as not a family household.",70,,
453,0.97,5141.736,5144.839,An occupant that is not part of that.,70,,
454,0.97,5144.839,5145.84,The first family House hold.,70,,
455,0.97,5145.84,5173.801,When you get into a situation where a family household is moving out but a Nonfamily household decides to stay after receiving a rent increase it allows for splitting of who is Ep titled to relocation assistance and makes it more easy to calculate what the amount of the relocation assistance will be.,70,,
456,0.97,5173.801,5184.145,In terms of timing the applicant must apply to Department of inspection within 180 days of receiving a notice.,70,,
457,0.97,5184.145,5185.48,I want to no one other thing.,70,,
458,0.97,5185.48,5190.885,I mentioned previously that now the notice for receiving the rent increase is 6 0-Days.,70,,
459,0.97,5190.885,5203.431,With the proposal that will be discussing in the next agenda to increase the notice period to 180 days that was parallel to what this bill proposes in terms of application period.,70,,
460,0.97,5203.431,5210.638,That does change the Dynamics and a policy choice that you all will have to make in terms of what you want to impact to be.,70,,
461,0.97,5210.638,5212.507,And as it currently stands.,70,,
462,0.97,5212.507,5222.283,Because there is 60 days of rent increase notice that means a tenant can apply anytime after that 60 day in this is issued.,70,,
463,0.97,5222.283,5227.822,And the rent increase to go in effect and 60 days after that.,70,,
464,0.97,5227.822,5247.375,The tenant would have the opportunity to apply for the rent increase as well as after it weapon to effect the outcome is that if it turns out for whatever reason that tenant thinks they can afford the increase and realizes that they can.,70,,
465,0.97,5247.375,5260.888,You could still tell the owner of the unit they were planning on vacating and be able to apply for relocation assistance.,70,,
466,0.97,5260.888,5274.202,18185 that would increase the period from 60 to 180 days that would limit the period in which the ten and the could apply for relocation assistance to fully before the rest increase goes into effect.,70,,
467,0.97,5274.202,5300.461,And so if that is the case the policy is around whether we want to limit the period in which that milk can occur before rent increase goes into effect or change the period of time in which the ten tenant can apply so they can afford the increase in rent and can't they may be able to apply after the rent increase goes into effect.,70,,
468,0.97,5300.461,5308.67,"So if there is no questions on that particular piece, I can get to the surrounding extension.",70,,
469,0.97,5308.67,5310.672,Very quickly.,71,,
470,0.97,5310.672,5323.851,For this time of issue another consideration is that we discussed was that the often times people just don't know what their rights are.,71,,
471,0.97,5323.851,5345.473,They may not know they have the opportunity to apply for this don't want to be in a situation where people are vulnerable and they have this right and the time limit is expired they don't have access to the relocation money that they needed.,71,,
472,0.97,5345.473,5350.411,Maybe they went to debt to move and they are eligible for relocation assistance.,71,,
473,0.97,5350.411,5358.82,They should be able to get it.,71,,
474,0.97,5358.82,5359.554,"Thanks, Ted.",71,,
475,0.97,5359.554,5402.53,So assuming there is this 190 day wouldn't in which a tenant can apply it is possible during that time the household needs time to gather information and gather things that are required for the application and might require additional time to submit application and so household representatives can apply--can ask SDI for application extension as long as they do so at the end of the 180 window and SDI can grant that extension upon find that there was good cause for the need for the extension.,71,,
476,0.97,5402.53,5404.065,The city application is incomplete.,71,,
477,0.97,5404.065,5413.674,Sdi can ask for more information and if they do so the household representative provides that information within 30 days.,71,,
478,0.97,5413.674,5427.789,As with the original submission the household can request an extension and as it is currently drafted the bill does allow SDI to Grand that extension upon finding of a good cause.,71,,
479,0.97,5427.789,5452.079,It does not say how long the extension would be but the question of whether that should be in the SDI director's discretion or it is something that we want to legislate.,71,,
480,0.97,5452.079,5456.918,If the ten and the RESCINDS a notice they must withdraw the application and pay back any funds received.,71,,
481,0.97,5456.918,5462.59,I will get to the refunds later in the presentation.,71,,
482,0.97,5462.59,5475.47,But this is a circumstance that the tenant has for relocation assistance and plans to move out and has issued that notice but decides for whatever reason that they are going to stay in the unit and not move out and they don't need relocation assistance.,71,,
483,0.97,5475.47,5493.12,That is when they are required to rescind the application and if they decide not to move out after they have received the relocation assistance they are required to refund that money back to SDI.,71,,
484,0.97,5493.12,5504.432,In terms of notice SDI does have to provide as drafted a couple different notices to several parties.,71,,
485,0.97,5504.432,5510.938,The first is it's upon receiving the application from the household representative.,71,,
486,0.97,5510.938,5531.559,The SDI must notify the owner within fire days of receiving it that this application is received and then SDI is supposed to make a decision within ten days of receiving the notice and they will have to provide notice to the owner as well as the household representative as to whether the household is going to receive relocation assistance or not.,71,,
487,0.97,5531.559,5540.134,So that is supposed to happen within ten days of receiving the completed application.,71,,
488,0.97,5540.134,5544.839,The application itself should contain a couple of things.,71,,
489,0.97,5544.839,5554.348,The actual notice of in tent to vacate or the tall proof that the households have vacated it already.,71,,
490,0.97,5554.348,5596.223,That States as much and current agreement and if it is a verbal or rental agreement approval of housing costs which SDI can do the location assistance that the House hold is entitled to and copy of the rent increase notice so it has to be issued 60 days before and the names of everyone in the households and the households in the unit and most of that information is so that it can be appropriately calculated that each households are vacating are entitled to receive.,71,,
491,0.97,5596.223,5611.706,In terms of the payment one difference between the tenant relocation assistance which is as is mentioned a different regulatory scheme.,72,,
492,0.97,5611.706,5614.675,In Treo the owner pays half and the city pays the other half.,72,,
493,0.97,5614.675,5620.047,The purpose of this bill the owner is paying one hundred percent of the relocation assistance.,72,,
494,0.97,5620.047,5640.534,While there is--it could have been possible to leave the city out all together having the landlord relocate and having the landlord get the funds to the tenant and if they did not get them they would have to do a violation.,72,,
495,0.97,5640.534,5652.246,The way the bill is structured for the owner to give the relocation assistance to Sdci and to give those funds to the tenants.,72,,
496,0.97,5652.246,5658.686,And my understanding that the reasoning is to correct for the imbalance that exists.,72,,
497,0.97,5658.686,5659.987,Between a landlord and tenant.,72,,
498,0.97,5659.987,5680.641,By getting the city involved in the transaction it means that tenant does not have to rely on a private right of act or the burden itself is not on the tenant to go forward in terms of getting the money that they are owed from the landlord.,72,,
499,0.97,5680.641,5689.684,If the landlord thinks that the tenant owes them for something they could take them out of the relocation assistance that tenant is owed.,72,,
500,0.97,5689.684,5693.854,None of those are practical options if Sdci is involved.,72,,
501,0.97,5693.854,5714.575,"Within seven days of receiving the notice that a household is eligible, the owner has to pay the designated am to Sdci and very specifically the legislation States that they can hold back any thing that they think they are owed outside of relocation stabs from that am.",72,,
502,0.97,5714.575,5720.247,Within five days Whenth payment is due is the DCI must forward it to the tenant.,72,,
503,0.97,5720.247,5742.002,You will see the way the bill is structured is not contingent on whether the owner has paid because the in tent to get the assistance to the tenants as quickly as possible and they must make that payment regardless whether the tenant has paid or not.,72,,
504,0.97,5742.002,5760.721,They can proceed the owner there are objections payment they can go after the owner to get the assistance that is owed but Sdci will have to have money on hand to be able to give the relocation assistance to the tenant within that Five- day period.,72,,
505,0.97,5760.721,5767.461,I will get to that more as we get to the refund piece as well.,72,,
506,0.97,5767.461,5773.0,So the amount of relocation assistance is based on a couple of calculations.,72,,
507,0.97,5773.0,5783.744,So as I mentioned the milk requires that there is proof of housing costs from the past 12 Montana.,72,,
508,0.97,5783.744,5785.146,Sdci will calculate the average Monthing costs.,72,,
509,0.97,5785.146,5793.154,If the past 12 months the rental amount has gone up and down they will come to an average amount.,72,,
510,0.97,5793.154,5825.519,And at that point again with the information in the application that tells you how many households are occupying the unit you end up taking the amount of average monthly rent and dividing it by the household and that gives Sdci the average monthly housing costs for each house Hol and you multiple by three and that is the am that owner owes to the tenant.,72,,
511,0.97,5825.519,5832.593,It is hard to understand abstractly but I will go through an example to demonstrate.,72,,
512,0.97,5832.593,5846.173,"In a housing unit that has two households and the rent for the entire unit is $3600, you would divide that 3600 by two.",72,,
513,0.97,5846.173,5851.845,So the average monthly cost is $1800 for each household.,72,,
514,0.97,5851.845,5862.489,You multiple Multiply it by three and each household would be $5400.,72,,
515,0.97,5862.489,5868.462,If both House holds leaving each one would be entitled to that $5400 amount.,72,,
516,0.97,5868.462,5875.336,"That is 10,000, $600 for the landlord.",72,,
517,0.97,5875.336,5877.738,This is simple and straight forward.,72,,
518,0.97,5877.738,5901.262,This can get complicated depending on the number of households and depending on if all households or no households are vacating and the ideas for the calculation to be as straight forward as possible when calculating housing costs and calculating who is made up of which households are made of each member.,72,,
519,0.97,5901.262,5904.965,That is not too much opportunity for things to get very confusing.,72,,
520,0.97,5904.965,5912.006,This is how it would work in a relatively straight forward situation.,72,,
521,0.97,5912.006,5919.246,I will pause quick for questions but otherwise I can go to the next piece on refunds.,72,,
522,0.97,5919.246,5924.184,Thank you so much Asha for your total presentation so far.,73,,
523,0.97,5924.184,5940.935,I don't see--I have been scanning the zoom to see if there are any zoom raised hands I don't see any so we can go on.,73,,
524,0.97,5940.935,5947.574,This is what happens if the household does not vacate the unit on the day that they say they are planning to leave.,74,,
525,0.97,5947.574,5958.485,If that happens has I mentioned the household representative must return any assistance to the city within ten days of that date on the notice to vacated.,74,,
526,0.97,5958.485,5961.822,On the in this of in tent to vacate.,74,,
527,0.97,5961.822,5974.969,In turn Sdci has to refund the payment to the owner within ten days of receiving the House Hol representative refund.,74,,
528,0.97,5974.969,5999.326,To refund or pay the relocation assistance as I mentioned is not dependent on when the refund comes in if the household representative does not pay Sdci has to refund the amount within ten days and we get into the Department's ability to pursue somebody for a refund.,74,,
529,0.97,5999.326,6022.015,Next piece is around appeals enforcement and so the legislation would give either the owner or the House hold representative the ability to appeal to the Examiner within ten days of the decision of either the approval or denial of the application for assistance or the amount that Sdci has calculated.,75,,
530,0.97,6022.015,6036.397,And so that appeals process will go through the hearing Examiner's office and all of the attendant rules and regulations that go with going through the hearing Examiner.,75,,
531,0.97,6036.397,6039.566,But Sdci will enforce any violation of the ordinance.,75,,
532,0.97,6039.566,6057.885,"If an owner does not end up paying and if a household representative does not issue a refund, if there's intentional misrepresentation, any of those kinds of things that would qualify as violation of the legislation Sdci will be responsible for enforcing.",75,,
533,0.97,6057.885,6060.821,The last piece is fiscal and staffing impact.,76,,
534,0.97,6060.821,6079.74,"As I mentioned because we have been developing the legislation for a while, we engaged with Sdci and the hearing Examiner awhile back and we will need to continue to engage them to figure out what exactly is going to be necessary to support the infrastructure that will need to support this Ordnance.",76,,
535,0.97,6079.74,6094.254,At a basic level anytime that there is new landlord tenant legislation there is an increase in call volume from landlords and tenants trying to figure out their rights and how to assert them.,76,,
536,0.97,6094.254,6111.138,At a minimum there is that increase in call volume and we will have to talk to Sdci about what that might look like and where they are now in terms of call volume and the landlord legislation that has passed recently.,76,,
537,0.97,6111.138,6115.876,So there will be in a new function RA EF suing the applications about who is eligible and who is not.,76,,
538,0.97,6115.876,6122.516,There will need to be staff to do that to do that entire process.,76,,
539,0.97,6122.516,6128.322,Very likely they will have to be some level of involvement from I.T.,76,,
540,0.97,6128.322,6138.131,To figure out how to receive payments and how to refund payments and how to track the timing of those.,76,,
541,0.97,6138.131,6161.455,And as I mentioned earlier in terms of the Spon of Sdci to give refunds and pay relocation assistance regardless of payments that means that they have to have another funding on hand to make those payments knowing that it may take awhile before they are able to pursue somebody to get the payments that the city is owed.,76,,
542,0.97,6161.455,6178.872,And so that difference in timing may mean they may have to be funded and front load funding that is designated as temporary relocation assistance until--so they can cover the number of applications that come in.,76,,
543,0.97,6178.872,6190.15,For purposes of the hearing Examiner a whole new case load for appeals and we will have to engage with them to determine how many cases are going to be expected and how long a case like this may take.,76,,
544,0.97,6190.15,6196.256,What the resources that they will need to be able to staff any kind of Appeals coming in will be.,76,,
545,0.97,6196.256,6208.168,And so that conversation we can start to have before the bill gets introduced and as the committee continues to discuss it.,76,,
546,0.97,6208.168,6223.45,With that I will stop sharing my screen unless somebody wants me to go back to a slide and I can answer questions as they coming up.,76,,
547,0.97,6223.45,6228.655,Thank you this is important conversation to have.,77,,
548,0.97,6228.655,6239.366,My understanding is that we are pretty ham strung in terms of relocation assistance.,77,,
549,0.97,6239.366,6248.041,Do you have any sense of what actually would have to happen before something like this could take effect?,77,,
550,0.97,6248.041,6275.469,"So at some point maybe a legal analysis on that but I don't currently have, but my sense is because this is not intended to be tenant relocation assistance that is substantial to relocation or demolition it is about an entirely different type of reasoning hind why we would provide relocation assistance.",78,,
551,0.97,6275.469,6277.304,My sense there is a distinction between those two things.,78,,
552,0.97,6277.304,6294.221,The other distinction it is not because it is not the city giving out money but the opener the relocation assistance .% of there may not be issues with the city having to provide it in its own funding to tenants that are eligible for relocation assistance.,78,,
553,0.97,6294.221,6304.631,If and when there is any legal analysis about issues with the state I will be happy to provide that to our community members.,78,,
554,0.97,6304.631,6304.965,Thank you.,79,,
555,0.97,6304.965,6305.365,"Thank you, Asha.",79,,
556,0.97,6305.365,6312.773,Did you have anything to add on that?,79,,
557,0.97,6312.773,6313.04,Yeah.,80,,
558,0.97,6313.04,6330.757,I just want to add that without--it is my understanding that nothing needs to change at the state level and we do actually have an analysis to that effect although from somebody in the city attorney's office that is now retired.,80,,
559,0.97,6330.757,6333.927,But can definitely share that with you.,80,,
560,0.97,6333.927,6357.651,But it is their analysis that no changes at the state level are needed in order to make this happen for the reason that Asha said that this is--that this is--if this bill was going to be changing trio then changes would need to be made at the state level but because this is addressing a whole new area it is not.,80,,
561,0.97,6357.651,6361.822,Thank you Ted and Asha for a very thorough presentation.,81,,
562,0.97,6361.822,6386.146,"I don't see any other questions and since we are almost at 3:15, I will--if there are no objections go to a briefing on the legislation that is developed in response to a request from the Seattle Renters Commission for rent increase.",81,,
563,0.97,6386.146,6399.659,We have legislation before the Covid emergency made other issues bigger priorities and we have substitute amendment prepared to update the bill to align with the current Seattle municipal code that it modifies.,81,,
564,0.97,6399.659,6418.178,"You look at the substitute amendment it looks like a lot of changes but in reality all that is changing is the substitute and does the technical corrections that need to be made, makes no substantive change from the bill that has been introduced.",81,,
565,0.97,6418.178,6430.824,The bill itself does one thing it increases the notice that landlords are required to give the tenants from Ren increases from two months as the law requires to six months.,81,,
566,0.97,6430.824,6438.732,Asha will of course be walking us through this bill and we will see if there are questions that need to be answered.,81,,
567,0.97,6438.732,6440.434,This is the initial discussion.,81,,
568,0.97,6440.434,6460.921,"We are not voting but given the technical aspects of the legislation, I suddenly would urge and welcome Councilmembers to voice any policy support that they may have for this one or concerns that they may have that we can help address.",81,,
569,0.97,6460.921,6462.422,Asha.,81,,
570,0.97,6462.422,6463.857,I will send it to you.,81,,
571,0.97,6463.857,6472.265,As chair Sawant mentioned this bill is relatively straight forward even though there is a lot of red lining in the amendment language.,82,,
572,0.97,6472.265,6487.214,The state law requires a minimum of 60 days so the landlord tenant regulation requires a landlord to provide notice of any Ren increase at least 60 days before the rent increase goes into effect.,82,,
573,0.97,6487.214,6490.684,And our current city law does the same.,82,,
574,0.97,6490.684,6495.488,"It says you have to adhere to that 60 day, minimum 60 day period.",82,,
575,0.97,6495.488,6499.292,What this bill does is double that amount of time.,82,,
576,0.97,6499.292,6514.608,Instead of 60 days notice before a rental increase goes into effect it would require landlords to give tenants 180 days notice before any kind of rent increase can go into effect.,82,,
577,0.97,6514.608,6528.054,As chair Sawant mentioned the original bill has a variety of Edits in various sections of the municipal code.,82,,
578,0.97,6528.054,6542.135,As the legislation 2019 since that time there is tenant legislation and cleanup legislation that is taking care of all of the technical changes that were proposed in the original bill.,82,,
579,0.97,6542.135,6548.742,"And so the amendment, amendment one adds Resitals to the bill and then it does two other things AZTEC Cal amendments.",82,,
580,0.97,6548.742,6556.75,It removes any of the language that was intended to correct the original text because things have been corrected.,82,,
581,0.97,6556.75,6568.395,And it updates the base language upon which the amendments were proposed since that amendment or language has changed since 2019 as well.,82,,
582,0.97,6568.395,6579.472,In terms of substantive purposes is leave that change from 60 to 180 days as the amendment.,82,,
583,0.97,6579.472,6590.717,"Amendment does pass, the only change that you will see at full council will be that change from 60 to 180 days.",82,,
584,0.97,6590.717,6594.955,I'm happy to answer any question.,82,,
585,0.97,6594.955,6598.291,Thank you Asha.,83,,
586,0.97,6598.291,6599.592,That was great.,83,,
587,0.97,6599.592,6603.43,It is open to questions from Councilmembers but I don't see any so far.,83,,
588,0.97,6603.43,6612.472,You let me know if you have any questions but as Asha explained the intent of the organization is very straight forward.,83,,
589,0.97,6612.472,6623.183,"And as I mentioned before there is definitely a recommendation from the rent, Commission to Seattle.",83,,
590,0.97,6623.183,6630.657,"Asha or Ted, did either of you have anything to add.",83,,
591,0.97,6630.657,6635.061,"Nothing from me, thank you.",84,,
592,0.97,6635.061,6636.262,Okay.,85,,
593,0.97,6636.262,6649.909,"Thank you both and in the absence of any comments or questions from Councilmember Morales, did you want to say something?",85,,
594,0.97,6649.909,6708.735,I don't see any comments or questions so I will go ahead and--I was going to adjourn the meeting but say Councilmembers thank you for participating in the discussion today and I certainly appreciate Councilmembers patience because I know we have had somewhat long committee meetings recently because we have been trying to catch up on a lot of things that were--that were put aside because the city had to deal with Covid emergencies and we are catching up on that and I appreciate your patience and engagement and having said that and having finished all of our agenda items for today I will adjourn the meeting and make sure that all committee and Council offices are contacted by my staff in terms of scheduling this special meetings for July and September.,85,,
595,0.97,6708.735,6709.436,Thank you and meeting adjourned.,85,,
