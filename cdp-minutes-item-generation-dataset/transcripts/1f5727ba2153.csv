320,0.97,3671.934,3696.059,You have heard the public testimony of workers who have been trained to come home and take off the clothes that they wear to work just like we have had to teach and train Farmworkers to take off their clothing for fear that they are going to be contaminating pesticides and transmitting those pesticides to their family members.,94,,
321,0.97,3696.059,3705.668,This is the type of situation that the workers in the city of Seattle are currently dealing with and they do not have hazard pay right now.,94,,
322,0.97,3705.668,3711.974,It should be no surprise that grocery workers face extremely high risk of exposure to Coronavirus and along with it the mental and psychological impacts that come with that potential exposure.,94,,
323,0.97,3711.974,3723.286,"As I noted last week and earlier this morning, one study of grocery workers in Boston found that 20% of those workers tested positive despite high use of masks.",94,,
324,0.97,3723.286,3755.818,"That is about a five times higher rate of exposure to Covid-19 and contracting it then those who are working on grocery store floors exposed to various customers daily, and as you heard from--and others who testified today, with the more recent advice to telling people to get in and out of grocery stores within 15 minutes, there is no possible way that a grocery store worker who has a six hour shift can only be exposed for 15 minutes.",94,,
325,0.97,3755.818,3795.057,"It is a hazardous situation and we also need those workers, we need to be able to rely on them for the supply of food to make sure our most vulnerable who cannot go Online and grocery stop Online like I do, so many people do not have access to the Internet like that, and some in our elderly community and who have vulnerable health conditions, they are not able to go and buy Online, and we need to make sure that everybody in those stores have the ability to be recognized for the incredibly hard work that they do because those workers are providing the most urgent and needed resources, services, and goods to our most vulnerable community members.",94,,

327,0.97,3828.758,3849.679,"We need to ensure that our entire system is functioning, and hazard pay is one element and recognizing the way that our grocery stores are part of our response as we search for solutions to the pandemic, without that solution yet in hand, we have to step up and honor the work that they do with hazard pay today.",94,,
328,0.97,3849.679,3876.038,"Thank you, and I sent you a quick message, I think the substitute you were referring to was a substitute the committee considered on Friday, which we voted out of committee, and that was subject to suspension of the rules, so unless there is another substitute we are not aware of since Friday, we do not need to do any more procedural votes in full counsel today.",95,,
329,0.97,3876.038,3877.24,"Excellent, thank you.",96,,
330,0.97,3877.24,3922.752,"Great, just a little pardon to the viewing public for the procedural Snafu, but we were able to figure it out and we are good to go, the substituted version of the bill that the committee considered on Friday is what is before the full counsel today for our consideration, there are no other amendments or substitutions that I am aware of, so we will go ahead and continue debate on Council bill 11 9990. are there any additional comments on the bill as described by Councilmember Mosqueda?",97,,

338,0.97,3985.147,4009.338,"Unfortunately we have seen in other industries and businesses that are less unionized or not unionized, workers who deserve similar Covid-19 hazard pay being denied pay or being given some but not enough and then having it unilaterally taken away by billionaire bosses, it shows the difference of being organized in a Union.",98,,
339,0.97,4009.338,4019.882,I urge all front-line workers who are following this legislation that it takes organizing to win things like hazard pay.,98,,
340,0.97,4019.882,4022.952,We win when we are organized.,98,,
341,0.97,4022.952,4046.008,"Most grocery workers in the Seattle area belonged to UFC W, so they have a type of collective power that is--that is why I urge you to form unions and fight for your rights collectively.",98,,
342,0.97,4046.008,4076.739,The history of the labor movement shows how organizing a Union in the workplace is against all odds and it requires--we stand at the ready to support you and work alongside you and your unions in your efforts so that we can win hazard pay for all workers struggling under the dual weight of Covid-19 and the capitalist recession.,98,,
343,0.97,4076.739,4100.563,"I am also happy to support the Amazon workers who--they face a very tough battle ahead, and we must support them, in fact we have already seen how shamefully the corporation is saying that they should have an in person vote knowing that this could depress turnout during Covid-19.",98,,
344,0.97,4100.563,4114.477,"I recognize that under this legislation the Council will be voting on today, hazard pay will be evaluated again in a few months, I hope that the pay will be made permanent and I stand with all UFC W members in fighting for this.",98,,

347,0.97,4148.477,4168.297,"I would also note that we need to keep--we see that under the tremendous pressure that small businesses and Cooperatives come under in the system of capitalism, they are facing increased pressures to get Corporatized.",98,,

352,0.97,4213.876,4233.796,"As I mentioned in briefing this morning, I will enthusiastically support this, and I think it is really important that it acknowledges those who put themselves on the front lines every day should be compensated for the work that they are doing.",100,,
353,0.97,4233.796,4245.574,Our ability to feed our families requires grocery workers showing up every day to stock shelves and set up produce displays and check us out.,100,,

360,0.97,4286.815,4300.162,"After reviewing, after rapidly reviewing and researching the--I have decided to support it.",102,,
361,0.97,4300.162,4304.066,I have consulted with both labor and employers.,102,,
362,0.97,4304.066,4337.166,"I do want to acknowledge that I think this legislation moved fast, to hear the legislation on Friday committee and then adopted on a Monday can make it difficult for some to review it thoroughly, at the same time I recognize that we are in the midst of a public health and economic emergency, therefore I do not want to further delay the temporary pay boost they should be receiving until both shots of the vaccine are administered to everyone, so I will be voting yesterday.",102,,
363,0.97,4337.166,4345.708,"Thank you Madam President, very excited to be voting for this legislation today, happy to be a cosponsor.",103,,
364,0.97,4345.708,4376.805,"I want to take a moment to lift up the great organizing work the UFC W has done to get us to this point today, like I said during briefing, I have seen the Checkers at my local grocery store plow or proudly wearing the Swag for this campaign, proudly calling me and sending me Emails, and that is solidarity, that organizing makes a huge difference.",103,,
365,0.97,4376.805,4422.484,"We may be the policymakers but it is that organizing that helps get this policy over the finish line, so I want to thank all of the work that UFC W and our other brothers and sisters in the labor movement have done to get us to this point, but I also want to recognize Councilmember Herbold and the work we did last year on similar legislation for workers in the App based economy . These are not Gigs, they are livelihoods, and it is not a gig economy, it is the economy, it is how we deliver goods and services now in this technological age and it is important that as technology changes, living standards keep up with that work.",103,,
366,0.97,4422.484,4468.997,"To that extent, it is a very logical policy to pursue, that we extend the same hazard pay considerations to the folks who are working in our Supermarkets and on the front lines and providing this essential service day in and day out, interacting with members of the public and going home to their families having exposed to themselves to the potential hazards of being in a position to have that additional support in recognition of their service and their sacrifice so I am happy to vote for this today, and I look forward to being able to get this relief out there.",103,,
367,0.97,4468.997,4472.034,"Thank you, are there any additional comments on the bill?",104,,
368,0.97,4472.034,4502.464,"Very quickly, I appreciate the comments of all of my colleagues and I appreciate and want to thank Councilmember Peterson for his weighing the need to act quickly as relates to this bill while also recognizing that acting quickly is not always ideal, but in this case when we are actually passing hazard pay that is--it is necessary.",105,,
369,0.97,4502.464,4551.013,"I appreciate Councilmember Mosqueda's leadership in this area over the last several years and also in responding to Covid-19 related workforce impacts, I appreciate working with Councilmember Lewis on the hazard pay legislation for Food- based or App -Based food delivery drivers, I wish we could require hazard pay for all of our essential workers, and I am really grateful to the work that essential workers are doing, putting themselves in harms way, particularly as it relates, and as we are expressing with this legislation, making sure that families and individuals are able to feed themselves and their families.",105,,
370,0.97,4551.013,4588.45,"And again, the fact that this is an area of our economy that is seeing windfall profits during Covid-19, because of the importance of this part of the market in the shift in consumer practices, an average of $17 billion in profits in the 1ST quarter of this year, as opposed to last year, according to Brookings.",105,,
371,0.97,4588.45,4614.042,"Is hazard pay recognizes the essential business of this work, it helps retain employees to cope keep stores running safely . and it helps them afford Childcare and deal with the physical and emotional risks of the work, finding options that can limit risks to family members and more.",105,,
372,0.97,4614.042,4640.402,"Different types of businesses were previously closed by order of the governor, nursery workers are the absolute essential workers whose companies have profited handsomely by the shift of consumers during these times, and our globe dealing and our nation's economy dealing with Covid-19, thank you.",105,,
373,0.97,4640.402,4651.013,"Thank you for those comments, are there any additional comments on the bill from any of my other colleagues?",106,,
374,0.97,4651.013,4653.015,I will say a few words quickly.,106,,
375,0.97,4653.015,4672.367,"I am going to start off with a note of gratitude to the chair of our Finance and counseling Committee, Councilmember Mosqueda, for being the champion and the prime sponsor of this legislation.",106,,
376,0.97,4672.367,4682.644,I know you did a lot of work in preparation to advancing this legislation.,106,,
377,0.97,4682.644,4711.339,I hope that you will have an opportunity to talk about some of that preliminary work that Predated the introduction and referral of the legislation in our debate in committee today to show folks that there was some thoughtful deliberation behind the ordinance and crafting the policy that I think was critical to influencing the substitute bill that we considered and approved and recommended the full council approved in the Finance and housing committee this last Friday.,106,,
378,0.97,4711.339,4735.697,"So thank you, and to your team members for the hard work that I know you all put into this legislation together with our counsel essential staff who is no stranger to the labor standards, deeply appreciative for her work as well.",106,,
379,0.97,4735.697,4767.529,"I also want to express my deep appreciation and gratitude for the leadership and the members of U.S. Cw local 21, they have been screaming from the highest points of any tower they could find, talking about the extremely dangerous conditions that their members and other Non-Represented folks experience every day, going into their job that is at a grocery store.",106,,
380,0.97,4767.529,4817.579,"It is absolutely important to acknowledge that they have spent much time organizing workers in this space, that they have done a tremendous job in making sure that we as policymakers are hearing directly from impacted workers, and from their members who have been exposed to Covid-19 in grocery stores and who have survived and--I am really deeply appreciative for their ongoing commitment to make sure that they are centering their members and making sure that the policymakers understand why the policy choices we make are so important.",106,,
381,0.97,4817.579,4876.638,"That is why I am also appreciative that Councilmember Pedersen made the remarks he made in regard to weighing the need to pass this with a sense of urgency as opposed to pursuing a longer Deliberative process, we have considered many pieces of legislation very quickly in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, everything from direct cash assistance to modification of--two additional labor standards and practices as it relates to other categories of workers, and I think this is still a period of time where we are experiencing a lot of neat and urgency to act quickly to make sure that we are being flexible and nimble in meeting the needs to a critical workforce in our city.",106,,
382,0.97,4876.638,4881.343,So I am really appreciative of the opportunity that we consider this legislation and to be listed as a cosponsor of it.,106,,
383,0.97,4881.343,4909.771,"I also know that we have spent a lot of time talking about the windfall corporate profits that have been made by many of the grocers in this period of time, and it is absolutely true that Consumerism has really shifted in a way that has funneled consumption of food toward every single grocery store that is available in the city.",106,,
384,0.97,4909.771,4926.855,"That is because our restaurants are closed for the most part, it is because our bars are closed for the most part, it is because the places that would normally be frequented by people outside of the grocery context no longer exist in some instances, so grocery stores are the place where almost everyone, if not everyone in our community goes to.",106,,
385,0.97,4926.855,4930.892,That means more volume and higher exposure.,106,,
386,0.97,4930.892,4989.617,"And many of the studies that we have seen that talk about the risk of exposure, talk about the risk of exposure from the customer perspective, from the consumer perspective, and in one report that I recall seeing, it talked about the risk of exposure to Covid-19 by simply being inside a grocery store was 80% higher than in any other setting, whether it be a restaurant, outdoor dining, or an outdoor party, that is an astronomical risk from a consumer perspective, now imagine what that number would be if we were looking at the exposure to risk, at the risk to exposure from Covid-19 from the worker perspective, from the grocery store worker perspective, it would be astronomically hard, it is astronomically large.",106,,
387,0.97,4989.617,5004.232,"I think this is an absolutely needed public health response, and we are not in a position where we can shutdown our grocery stores, they are the only thing left in our community where people can go and find food in the absence of a different economic model that is safe and available for people.",106,,
388,0.97,5004.232,5062.724,"We need to acknowledge that there is a hazard in this environment and that workers need to be compensated to feel that they are respected and that their role in this response to Covid-19 is seen and dignified, and I am so proud to be able to stand with all of you colleagues, and most importantly, the members of the U.S. Cw local 21 and all the local grocery store workers in making sure that we take a strong stand here and say yes to hazard pay and making sure that we continue to advance these policies that will really make a significant difference for people if they do find themselves in an unfortunate situation of being exposed, or in just the basic mode of trying to figure out how to make ends meet while also trying to stay safe.",106,,
389,0.97,5062.724,5080.608,"With that being said, I am going to go ahead and conclude my remarks and see if anyone else has any remarks, and if not, we are going to hand it over to the prime sponsor, Councilmember Mosqueda, for closing remarks.",106,,
390,0.97,5080.608,5082.343,"You have the last word, take us home.",106,,
391,0.97,5082.343,5084.446,Thank you very much.,107,,
392,0.97,5084.446,5120.849,"Thanks again for your comments today, your incredible deliberation of this important topic, and as Councilmember Lewis and Councilmember Herbold have noted, the way you have stepped up to provide much needed relief to front-line workers throughout this pandemic, this is one additional piece of the puzzle as we serve to protect the public in the broader public health and to make sure that those front-line workers are having their workplaces respected and that we are recognizing the hazard in which many of these front-line workers are facing everyday.",107,,
393,0.97,5120.849,5176.237,"The hazard pay ordinance that we are about to pass will--it encourages them to continue their vital work in our supply Foodchain, and this in exchange supports the welfare and the health--making a choice between keeping a job and providing for a child for example should not be a situation that any worker is facing, making a choice between going to work and putting yourself in harm's way should not be something that any family should have to experience, but this is the experience right now of grocery store workers in Seattle.",107,,
394,0.97,5176.237,5188.249,I mentioned an example of a few weeks ago as we began to deliberate this piece of legislation which really underscored for me the urgency of why we need to act now and act in the city of Seattle.,107,,
395,0.97,5188.249,5198.026,"Over the holiday break I was told about a story of a local grocery store worker who has a child, and she works here in a grocery store in Seattle.",107,,
396,0.97,5198.026,5222.784,"She made an impossible decision to be able to keep her job, in order to keep her job, she needs Childcare, but because she could not afford any of the Childcare in her local area, she has been driving to Lakewood, dropping her child off, and going to Seattle to do her shift at a local grocery store, driving back to pick up her kid, and sleeping in their car.",107,,
397,0.97,5222.784,5227.555,Because she does not have the resources that she needed to be able to afford Childcare and to pay rent.,107,,
398,0.97,5227.555,5243.104,"This is the situation that our front-line workers are being placed in, in addition to being in hazards way everyday.",107,,
399,0.97,5243.104,5249.611,"When I heard that story, there are so many issues that I know we have to address to address the underlying insecurity of that situation, but I knew that we could act.",107,,
400,0.97,5249.611,5261.256,"We could act and provide hazard pay, to recognize the hazard that this employee is in every day, and hopefully that additional compensation will help to ensure that it is not just Childcare, but also greater stability and access to housing.",107,,
401,0.97,5261.256,5270.932,These are the situations that we find our workers in Seattle facing.,107,,
402,0.97,5270.932,5286.347,Grocery store workers face serious risk of Covid-19 infection and the least we can do is provide them with access to vaccines and the city council acting today making sure that they are able to access hazard pay.,107,,
403,0.97,5286.347,5301.062,"You heard the story from Maggie who testified during last week's hearing and again this morning, where worker after worker testified about the hazards they are facing everyday.",107,,
404,0.97,5301.062,5312.974,"One person said I come to work Úearly every day, crying already, shaking with anxiety over having to deal with unmasked customers and the risk of contracting Covid-19.",107,,
405,0.97,5312.974,5325.787,One person said I did not sign up to sacrifice myself to keep the community Fed during the worst public health crisis in my lifetime.,107,,
406,0.97,5325.787,5340.001,"But that is what is happening, and I am asked to do this on the same pay when the greatest risk I faced last year was crossing the parking lot at the end of my shift.",107,,
407,0.97,5340.001,5358.486,"The tremendous risk that workers are facing, the hazard they encounter every day during Covid-19, and as my colleagues have mentioned, the additional work they are taking on to clean our grocery stores and--needs to be rewarded.",107,,
408,0.97,5358.486,5369.497,"Up and down the West Coast, cities, jurisdictions are not only following suit, some of Thm have already acted on the very type of legislation we are considering today.",107,,
409,0.97,5369.497,5381.642,The city of Berkeley has already passed legislation of a 5 dollars per hour hazard pay.,107,,
410,0.97,5381.642,5409.871,The current schedule in front of us for the city of Los Angeles which is taking--with a potential vote on--and those cities just like Seattle are not doing this overnight.,107,,
411,0.97,5409.871,5415.143,I will also reflect on the Timeline for the viewing public.,107,,
412,0.97,5415.143,5439.1,"We began hearing about the wave of interest across the West Coast and in other parts of the country to enact hazard pay prior to the holiday break, and I began by asking questions about what the data shows to try to get stories and a better understanding for front-line workers themselves.",107,,
413,0.97,5439.1,5449.911,We began the research with the office of labor standards and our essential staff immediately when we heard that there was potential for passing this and other cities and jurisdictions as well.,107,,
414,0.97,5449.911,5468.396,I want to thank--to have a better understanding from the qualitative stories they have been receiving in addition to the quantitative analysis that had been provided.,107,,
415,0.97,5468.396,5484.846,I mentioned the October 2020 Boston study that found that grocery store workers had encountered Covid-19 rates five times higher than that of the general public.,107,,
416,0.97,5484.846,5505.066,"This is the data and the analysis that went into--early in January we began working with the office of labor standards also in conversation with the Mayor's office, and I want to thank them for their ongoing expressed support, to take a look at what the policies and discussions should be.",107,,
417,0.97,5505.066,5522.183,And we Crafted this initially with feedback not just for--but also by making sure that we reached out to the grocers.,107,,
418,0.97,5522.183,5536.397,"Also reaching out ultimately to the chamber to get feedback again, not necessarily signaling support but wanting to make sure that we got feedback so that we could better understand how these policies could be applied.",107,,
419,0.97,5536.397,5546.874,"It is the type of Deliberative work my office does, and we wanted to make sure that we acted with urgency as much as we also maintained our commitment to working with diverse Stakeholders.",107,,
420,0.97,5546.874,5584.745,"This type of conversation cannot happen overnight, and it is important that we get the details right, so for everybody who has been providing feedback, we appreciate your work with us especially as we recognize that this is a matter of life and death, this is a matter of how we are expecting--to help us as a broader population to have access to food and essentials at our grocery stores.",107,,
