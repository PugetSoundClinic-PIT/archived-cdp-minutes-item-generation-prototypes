61,0.97,267.133,281.347,"We had multiple compounding crises, the economic downturn, housing crisis, homelessness state of emergency, civil rights reckoning and public health crisis, all at the same time dealing with a national Federal election.",21,,
62,0.97,281.347,287.253,And the chaos that was sown by misinformation coming from the Trump administration.,21,,
63,0.97,287.253,299.065,In addition to very little support given the divided Congress and we appreciate all of our congressional members that fought to make sure there was Covid-19 relief.,21,,
64,0.97,299.065,302.869,We will continue to work with those Federal partners and look forward to working with the new administration.,21,,
65,0.97,302.869,325.858,"Colleagues, if you did not see the column this morning, he really applauded Seattle city council for stepping up and leading the effort to make sure Ãšthat we past the Jumpstart progressive payroll tax to help hundreds of workers, small businesses, I should say hundreds of thousands, of small businesses, and workers, provide transportation, assistance, provide assistance to immigrants and refugees.",21,,
66,0.97,325.858,332.298,And most importantly ensure that folks stay housed and the homeless neighbors have support.,21,,
67,0.97,332.298,336.602,"Without the Jumpstart Seattle package, to put it mildly, he would have been more in a world of hurt.",21,,
68,0.97,336.602,344.51,"Thank goodness that we did pass that because this budget, in part, balances because we have Rogressive revenue we can rely on.",21,,
69,0.97,344.51,350.216,"We had a slight Uptick in the revenue forecast, but that is not the only thing that saved us.",21,,
70,0.97,350.216,363.83,"All of you have to Prioritize investments, directly into the communities, while we also rebuild the Reserve from $3 million, in the proposed budget, to now, $40 million.",21,,
71,0.97,363.83,365.231,Just under $40 million.,21,,
72,0.97,365.231,369.736,This is a huge note of I think accomplishment.,21,,
73,0.97,369.736,371.337,But also not enough.,21,,
74,0.97,371.337,391.457,"We will continue to work to make sure that there is additional assistance, to make ure that those who are now having to shatter their businesses again because of the third wave of Covid-19, and workers across the city and small businesses get the support that they need, in addition to our most vulnerable, our seniors, and our folks not able to work.",21,,

86,0.97,459.125,462.128,We cannot eliminate positions in programs because that only prolongs economic hurt.,21,,
87,0.97,462.128,466.699,And worsens the outcome for private businesses and our residents as a whole.,21,,
88,0.97,466.699,495.261,"This budget, in conclusion, with the inclusion of all of the amendments that you have continue to propose, and the amendments that we will discuss today, invest heavily in stopping the spread of Covid- 19, working to ensure small businesses have what they can to survive and helping workers by making sure that they have access to transit and ensuring neighbors do not fall deeper into housing and security are homelessness.",21,,
89,0.97,495.261,498.264,We are investing in community safety and know that we have much more to do.,21,,
90,0.97,498.264,500.733,But we are chipping away at those inequities.,21,,
91,0.97,500.733,504.77,Inequities that we know have only been exacerbated by Covid- 19.,21,,
92,0.97,504.77,506.672,We have a lot in front of us today.,21,,
93,0.97,506.672,511.878,"I set that tone to say, I am really proud of the Council and the way that we have all come together to work on this.",21,,

95,0.97,519.218,535.268,"And that the folks in the community at large know the important work that you have done, the changes that you proposed, the Swaths that you are suggesting and if there are additional things that we come to today, to make sure we have a robust conversation about it.",21,,
96,0.97,535.268,540.172,We have much more to do with the call of investments and divestment in public safety and the call that lack lives truly matter.,21,,
97,0.97,540.172,543.609,In our budget documents and legislative documents to come next year.,21,,
98,0.97,543.609,562.695,"I hope that this budget is seen as a continued investment in the strategies that we need for our communities through direct housing support, additional support for rental assistance, food assistance, Childcare opportunities, and making sure that we are addressing environmental racism.",21,,

1086,0.97,5461.689,5462.49,That is so true.,186,,
1087,0.97,5462.49,5473.434,"I know all of us are thinking of his laugh right now and probably more importantly feeling the effects of his longtime advocacy and seeing the importance of the work right now, as people struggle to pay rent and put food on the table.",186,,
1088,0.97,5473.434,5495.156,"His legacy and all that we have learned from him and all policies that he put into statute, just a few examples including expansion, fighting Auditory landing, fighting for mortgage mediation, earned income tax credit, asset building for communities especially of communities of color.",186,,

1095,0.97,5540.835,5544.105,"And with that we honor Tony's life and say, just how much we are going to Miss him.",186,,
1096,0.97,5544.105,5553.18,"It is a huge loss for us, not only the city, the state, but the entire nation because he taught many people how to do advocacy.",186,,

1111,0.97,5622.55,5630.091,"As a reminder, you do not need a second, a vote to second the action to remove an item from the consent package.",188,,
1112,0.97,5630.091,5633.894,As we are just looking at group a right now.,188,,
1113,0.97,5633.894,5638.399,The package is largely sort of been understood in detail in last Tuesday's presentation.,188,,
1114,0.97,5638.399,5643.771,"The Aly Pennucci will help us remind us what the items are, just for the record.",188,,
1115,0.97,5643.771,5662.99,"And, I am going to ask folks, if you have items you would like to pull from the consent package, again group a at this point, let's wait until Aly Pennucci gets full through the full list of the items and that I will ask if folks want to identify an item.",188,,
1116,0.97,5662.99,5667.228,We can pull it out at that point so we have the whole picture of the item in front of us.,188,,
1117,0.97,5667.228,5676.337,"Aly Pennucci, I think I will go ahead and turn it to you, to walk us through the group a items here, which is the original consent package.",188,,
1118,0.97,5676.337,5688.749,"And I appreciate all the work that you and your team have done, to create this foundation will get us to group B later in the group C. thank you Aly Pennucci.",188,,

1121,0.97,5694.221,5697.258,Okay.,190,,
1122,0.97,5697.258,5698.592,Is a better?,191,,
1123,0.97,5698.592,5699.927,Okay.,191,,
1124,0.97,5699.927,5713.941,"Before we move into actually talking about the items in group a, I just want to briefly walk through the agenda for today and how the voting process will work.",191,,
1125,0.97,5713.941,5715.776,"So, today we are on step five.",191,,
1126,0.97,5715.776,5716.377,"Next like, please.",191,,
1127,0.97,5716.377,5728.389,"In the budget process, where the committee will go on the balancing package and the amendment package.",191,,
1128,0.97,5728.389,5736.997,"There are three voting groups today, voting group a, this includes items that were presented on November 10th, that are not affected by form C proposals.",191,,
1129,0.97,5736.997,5746.207,"This is items 2 through 125 in the agenda that will be voted on as a consent package, excluding any items that Council members remove for vote.",191,,
1130,0.97,5746.207,5756.25,"Voting group B, includes form C, to balance in what we are describing in the balanced amendment package.",191,,
1131,0.97,5756.25,5761.522,This group combined with group a are a complete balanced package.,191,,
1132,0.97,5761.522,5768.195,"The amendments in group B include item 126-160, in the agenda.",191,,
1133,0.97,5768.195,5775.636,"And like group a, the group will be voted on as a consent package unless items are removed from the group.",191,,
1134,0.97,5775.636,5784.044,"And finally, voting group 3, including proposals submitted in form C, that are not in the balanced amendment package.",191,,
1135,0.97,5784.044,5790.351,These are Stand-Alone items that are self balanced or do not spend money.,191,,
1136,0.97,5790.351,5792.253,They include items 162-169 on the agenda.,191,,
1137,0.97,5792.253,5795.022,Next slide.,191,,
1138,0.97,5795.022,5800.761,After the votes today and tomorrow we will be on the final step in the budget process.,191,,
1139,0.97,5800.761,5802.53,On Monday morning the committee will reconvene.,191,,
1140,0.97,5802.53,5809.036,There will be technical amendments that are necessary to reconcile all of the actions taken today and tomorrow.,191,,
1141,0.97,5809.036,5814.742,And final votes on the remaining pieces of budget legislation.,191,,
1142,0.97,5814.742,5827.688,"Again this will help in happen in Committee on Monday and then that afternoon at full Council, the Council will vote on all of legislation and adopt the city's 2021 budget.",191,,
1143,0.97,5827.688,5833.394,"Before moving to the voting groups, I will briefly walk through some procedural items.",191,,
1144,0.97,5833.394,5839.099,The next two slides outlined the motions necessary to add the item to the agenda.,191,,
1145,0.97,5839.099,5843.571,With the agenda already adopted I am not going to spend a lot of time walking through these in detail.,191,,
1146,0.97,5843.571,5850.878,"But if a council member wants to add an item to the agenda later in the meeting today or tomorrow, we can return to the sides.",191,,
1147,0.97,5850.878,5853.113,"Patty, if you could move to the voting group process slide.",191,,
1148,0.97,5853.113,5855.516,Thank you.,191,,
1149,0.97,5855.516,5865.693,"So how today will go, when we get to a voting group, the chair will move to approve all items in the group and then we will read items in the group into the record.",191,,
1150,0.97,5865.693,5874.602,"And Council members may remove a CPA, council budget action or budget Attent, for individual consideration.",191,,
1151,0.97,5874.602,5882.343,"This includes removing an item from the group, so that a substitution can be made when we return to the individual items.",191,,
1152,0.97,5882.343,5885.546,"Next slide, please.",191,,
1153,0.97,5885.546,5898.559,"After reading all items from the group and noting any items that were removed, the committee will vote on the group as amended in one vote.",191,,
1154,0.97,5898.559,5903.898,The committee will then take up the items that were removed for individual consideration and those will be considered an Alphanumeric order Department.,191,,
1155,0.97,5903.898,5908.168,"Next like, please.",191,,
1156,0.97,5908.168,5919.88,"The chair already describe the process, if you want to substitute a different item on the agenda, you want to remove the item.",191,,
1157,0.97,5919.88,5928.689,"And at the chair's request, please make the motions to remove items at the, after we have read the items in the package to the record.",191,,
1158,0.97,5928.689,5929.957,"Next like, please.",191,,
1159,0.97,5929.957,5941.468,This slide demonstrates the motion necessary to remove an item for individual vote.,191,,
1160,0.97,5941.468,5943.904,This does not require a second and does not require a vote.,191,,
1161,0.97,5943.904,5948.175,You simply need to make the motion to remove the item or a group of items from the consent group.,191,,
1162,0.97,5948.175,5951.612,"Next slide, please.",191,,
1163,0.97,5951.612,5955.482,Let me see here.,191,,
1164,0.97,5955.482,5968.696,"When we return to the items that were removed from the package, and after the sponsor moves the item, for consideration, by the committee, a council member can then make a motion to substitute a different option.",191,,
1165,0.97,5968.696,5974.335,This slide shows the motions needed to substitute one option for the other.,191,,
1166,0.97,5974.335,5993.854,"So as an example, a council member may have propose to spend $100,000 to pay for a new staff position and another Council member to make a substitute to modify the position title or spend that money in a different way.",191,,
1167,0.97,5993.854,5995.656,'s motion requires a second.,191,,
1168,0.97,5995.656,6003.53,And after a second we will describe the proposed substitute and how it differs from the original item that was posted to the agenda.,191,,
1169,0.97,6003.53,6005.799,The sponsor may speak to that proposal.,191,,
1170,0.97,6005.799,6011.338,After the discussion then the chair will call the boat on a motion to substitute.,191,,
1171,0.97,6011.338,6013.173,This requires a majority vote.,191,,
1172,0.97,6013.173,6014.541,"Next slide, please.",191,,
1173,0.97,6014.541,6023.484,"If the motion to substitute is adopted, the original CBA or Sli is no longer available for consideration.",191,,
1174,0.97,6023.484,6031.458,So a Yes vote on the motion to substitute is essentially a no vote on the original item.,191,,
1175,0.97,6031.458,6037.498,And we will repeat this several times we get to items that will be substituted.,191,,
1176,0.97,6037.498,6047.708,That at a relatively Plast--fast clip provides an overview on how the committee will organize itself today.,191,,
1177,0.97,6047.708,6053.18,Unless there are questions we can move onto the next item on the agenda.,191,,
1178,0.97,6053.18,6055.215,"Not seen questions, thanks so much, Aly Pennucci.",192,,
1179,0.97,6055.215,6059.686,Thank you.,193,,
1180,0.97,6059.686,6076.336,"So folks, I just want to remind people that as we hear about each item in group a, as you think about if there is any item you would like to remove, just a reminder that you do not have to remove an item just to speak to it.",194,,
1181,0.97,6076.336,6081.241,"Before we do the final vote on group a, we will open up for additional comments or questions.",194,,
1182,0.97,6081.241,6100.327,"And that is a chance to really lift up pieces that you have championed, that have been included in group A. and if you want folks to know more about that item and you don't want to be buried, you don't have to move it but will give you a chance to speak to it.",194,,
1183,0.97,6100.327,6102.529,Moving the items gives us a chance for debate and discussion.,194,,
1184,0.97,6102.529,6108.435,"It is just to lift up her clarity and highlight, we will let you do that and keep it in group a and allow the, to happen.",194,,
1185,0.97,6108.435,6108.702,Okay.,194,,
1186,0.97,6108.702,6110.07,Aly Pennucci.,194,,

1503,0.97,8283.108,8293.451,"And then second, are you asking Council members to make arguments to justify the request to remove things at this juncture?",220,,

1505,0.97,8293.685,8301.059,"My understanding is that you just want us to say the item number, the Blg number, and move along.",220,,

1508,0.97,8306.531,8307.766,And I'm not being critical of that.,222,,
1509,0.97,8307.766,8316.841,I just want to know what the--I want to know what the procedure is here in terms of how you want us to remove these items in the most efficient way.,222,,
1510,0.97,8316.841,8319.577,Because I know we will be debating these items.,222,,
1511,0.97,8319.577,8320.779,That's why we're pulling them.,222,,
1512,0.97,8320.779,8321.012,Yes.,223,,

1515,0.97,8336.061,8342.901,This is important because our documents do not have the item number on the actual sheet.,223,,
1516,0.97,8342.901,8345.637,They have the Sli or the CBA number.,223,,
1517,0.97,8345.637,8351.576,And we can correspond that with the agenda.,223,,

1522,0.97,8367.425,8370.228,This is not the time to debate the merits.,223,,
1523,0.97,8370.228,8373.398,I think so that Council members will have plenty of time to do that.,223,,
1524,0.97,8373.398,8379.104,We don't need it to be moved and we don't need it to be Seconded.,223,,
1525,0.97,8379.104,8381.806,So just item R identify the number you'd like to move.,223,,

1684,0.97,8892.516,8905.83,"Because Councilmember Morales and chair Mosqueda have the same initials in the voting bloc box, Councilmember Mosqueda will show up as BC as budget chair so you can distinguish what items they voted for.",290,,
1685,0.97,8905.83,8910.034,I wanted to note that for the viewing public.,290,,
1686,0.97,8910.034,8910.568,Thank you.,290,,
1687,0.97,8910.568,8912.336,Thank you very much.,291,,
1688,0.97,8912.336,8912.803,Another reminder.,292,,
1689,0.97,8912.803,8918.175,"As we consider these items that have been removed from group a, from our consent package.",292,,
1690,0.97,8918.175,8926.384,"Central staff and the clerk will be reminding us that the staff to substitute any item, if there is a substitute for consideration.",292,,
1691,0.97,8926.384,8930.087,If there is a substitute after a motion is Seconded.,292,,
1692,0.97,8930.087,8937.762,We'll then recognize the central staff to walk us through both on an item and on the agenda to be substituted.,292,,
1693,0.97,8937.762,8940.665,Many of these items here do not have a substitute that I'm aware of.,292,,
1694,0.97,8940.665,8945.002,And I believe that they have been pulled for discussion purposes today.,292,,
1695,0.97,8945.002,8948.406,"At this point, Aly, would you like to summarize each item?",292,,
1696,0.97,8948.406,8958.382,"I'll then turn it to the person who has made the motion to remove it, and then to the sponsor of the item to initiate the discussion.",292,,
1697,0.97,8958.382,8962.92,"Chair Mosqueda, were you looking for a new detailed description of the title?",293,,
1698,0.97,8962.92,8966.057,Just read the title if that's good for you.,294,,
1699,0.97,8966.057,8974.298,"Item 62, H SD 9B2 would add $1.1 billion to the human services Department for drug use, and imposes a proviso.",295,,
1700,0.97,8974.298,8981.639,And I'll just add a little here that this is actually funding that was provided by the Council several years ago.,295,,
1701,0.97,8981.639,8990.648,"This is being cut into third quarter supplemental, to be added back to the human services Department.",295,,
1702,0.97,8990.648,8997.822,"In 2021, on this proposal, as well as two other proposals that are related to services in the 2021 budget.",295,,
1703,0.97,8997.822,8998.356,Okay.,296,,
1704,0.97,8998.356,9002.56,Thank you very much.,296,,
1705,0.97,9002.56,9005.796,"And Councilmember Pedersen, I believe you moved this item.",296,,
1706,0.97,9005.796,9007.698,You're recognized to speak to your move to remove it.,296,,
1707,0.97,9007.698,9011.535,Then I will turn it over to the sponsor.,296,,
1708,0.97,9011.535,9013.27,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",297,,
1709,0.97,9013.27,9017.742,And I know this proposal has a lot of support.,297,,
1710,0.97,9017.742,9020.711,And I appreciate the rationale behind that support.,297,,
1711,0.97,9020.711,9025.95,I was not part of the original Council that had approved the money originally.,297,,
1712,0.97,9025.95,9028.052,So I just want to be consistent.,297,,
1713,0.97,9028.052,9044.802,"I am, even though this is not setting aside a specific safe injection site, it's funding similar activities, which have--which still result in the same concerns that I've had and that I've heard from others.",297,,
1714,0.97,9044.802,9054.345,"I visited the--I had a formal tour of the insight injection facility in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Canada.",297,,
1715,0.97,9054.345,9061.519,"And the outcomes for that program, in terms of getting people into treatment were not strong.",297,,
1716,0.97,9061.519,9069.527,There was a report done by the Opioid coordination Council back in 2018 that question the efficacy of certain programs like this.,297,,
1717,0.97,9069.527,9072.096,So I know this is a little bit different.,297,,
1718,0.97,9072.096,9075.232,But I just wanted to pull it out of the consent package.,297,,
1719,0.97,9075.232,9077.101,I can vote for the consent package.,297,,
1720,0.97,9077.101,9079.437,And I'll be voting no on this particular item.,297,,
1721,0.97,9079.437,9079.77,Thank you.,297,,
1722,0.97,9079.77,9082.873,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Pedersen.",298,,
1723,0.97,9082.873,9086.177,I'm sure the sponsor would like to help to change your mind on this.,298,,
1724,0.97,9086.177,9088.245,So let's give the sponsor a chance to speak about this item.,298,,
1725,0.97,9088.245,9091.549,Thank you so much.,299,,
1726,0.97,9091.549,9099.256,"As Aly mentioned, the Council has voted on this in 2018, again in 2019.",299,,
1727,0.97,9099.256,9107.064,And the Council also voted on additional funding that was inadvertently removed in 2020.,299,,
1728,0.97,9107.064,9118.442,The budget action moves already appropriated funding of $1.12 million to H SD for similar services as Oproved by previous budget action.,299,,
1729,0.97,9118.442,9121.645,But for new approaches to provide these services.,299,,
1730,0.97,9121.645,9126.65,It directs H SD to direct contract public health for these services.,299,,
1731,0.97,9126.65,9131.288,Many thanks to my cosponsors.,299,,
1732,0.97,9131.288,9134.358,"Councilmembers Morales, Sawant, Strauss, Lewis, and Council president for their support.",299,,
1733,0.97,9134.358,9140.297,"As you know, these funds have been a high Council priority for a number of years, in spending.",299,,
1734,0.97,9140.297,9143.868,These funds have been stalled for the same amount of time.,299,,
1735,0.97,9143.868,9149.106,"Just again, it's a little additional background.",299,,
1736,0.97,9149.106,9158.282,"Council appropriated the $1.3 million for what at the time were referred to as community health engagement locations, known as Chels.",299,,
1737,0.97,9158.282,9161.519,"And added an additional $100,000 in 2019.",299,,
1738,0.97,9161.519,9164.455,Both of which carried forward to 2020.,299,,
1739,0.97,9164.455,9181.839,"Earlier this summer, as part of the 2020 rebalancing package, council took this unanimous vote to restore an additional $100,000 which had been Errantly admitted to the Carry- forward ordinance.",299,,
1740,0.97,9181.839,9195.819,The public defender Association in Washington have developed a new approach to supervised consumption that does not rely on establishing a specific new location to provide supervised consumption sites.,299,,
1741,0.97,9195.819,9201.025,"Instead, it focuses on providing services in locations that are already serving these folks.",299,,
1742,0.97,9201.025,9206.864,"My September 22nd public safety and human services Committee, included a presentation on this approach.",299,,
1743,0.97,9206.864,9223.981,"It included a representation from King County public health, who King County public health concurred that this new approach was consistent with the recommendations of the King County board of health received in 2018.",299,,
1744,0.97,9223.981,9230.854,I've shared this new approach with H SD director Johnson and asked for feedback.,299,,
1745,0.97,9230.854,9236.66,Director Johnson shared it with the Mayor's office and indicated they were leading on this.,299,,
1746,0.97,9236.66,9244.902,"The Seattle times has reported that the Mayor's office said the Mayor was interested in learning more about this, how this new proposal could work.",299,,
1747,0.97,9244.902,9250.608,"And would seek legal Council, regarding the risks, given upcoming changes at the Federal level.",299,,
1748,0.97,9250.608,9261.585,"It will be important for us to receive additional counsel after the budget is passed, and I look forward to having a conversation with the Mayor's office, later this year, about the approach.",299,,
1749,0.97,9261.585,9272.329,"For now, this action allows Council to protect these Hard- fought dollars and ensure that they are available in 2021.",299,,
1750,0.97,9272.329,9276.333,Council member Pedersen spoke to treatment outcomes.,299,,
1751,0.97,9276.333,9283.54,I think there are definitely different studies about the efficacy in treatment outcomes.,299,,
1752,0.97,9283.54,9290.047,And I have seen some studies that are more--more positive.,299,,
1753,0.97,9290.047,9292.449,But we can hold that for another day.,299,,
1754,0.97,9292.449,9303.56,I think it's really important to emphasize that the most important outcome of safe consumption size is the saving of lives.,299,,
1755,0.97,9303.56,9308.932,There have been no drug Overdose at any safe consumption sites anywhere in the world.,299,,
1756,0.97,9308.932,9323.147,"And if you have somebody that you care about and love, who is an addict, what you care about most first is that they do not die in the throes of their addiction.",299,,
1757,0.97,9323.147,9327.384,And then you hope that they seek treatment.,299,,
1758,0.97,9327.384,9339.363,But the objective of this is really to focus on the Life- saving services that these--that safe consumption services can provide.,299,,
1759,0.97,9339.363,9345.903,"We know that Overdose deaths and harms from drug Overdose, have continued to rise in King County, since 2011.",299,,
1760,0.97,9345.903,9350.107,And it's definitely time for us to do something different to save lives.,299,,
1761,0.97,9350.107,9360.517,"I think a lot of us have people that we love and care about, who have these challenges.",299,,
1762,0.97,9360.517,9371.929,"And there are, again, a lot of different ideas about what is the best efficacy towards leading people to treatment options.",299,,
1763,0.97,9371.929,9375.933,But people will not receive treatment if they die.,299,,
1764,0.97,9375.933,9388.746,So this is really focused on the harm redemption principals that are necessary to implement in order to have any chance of helping people receive treatment.,299,,
1765,0.97,9388.746,9399.189,"Really wanted to say again, I appreciate the new ideas that have been brought forward by the public defenders Association and the ACLU.",299,,
1766,0.97,9399.189,9400.39,Just access to health.,299,,
1767,0.97,9400.39,9401.358,Yes to Scs and others.,299,,
1768,0.97,9401.358,9406.93,And I hope that we can finally make it possible to move on these dollar in 2021.,299,,
1769,0.97,9406.93,9415.205,I think many of you saw the E- mail that we all received from the ACLU of Washington this morning.,299,,
1770,0.97,9415.205,9421.111,The E-mail notes are strong evidence that these services work.,299,,
1771,0.97,9421.111,9424.081,Over 100 safe consumption services programs operate across the world.,299,,
1772,0.97,9424.081,9430.788,There is no evidence of an Overdose death at any of these sites.,299,,
1773,0.97,9430.788,9435.692,Even the American Medical Association has called for these programs to be opened.,299,,
1774,0.97,9435.692,9456.48,"It's also aligned with Seattle's long history of being a leader for Progressive drug reform, including being one of the first jurisdictions to adopt needle exchange programs, the war on drugs, and its racially based enforcement have failed.",299,,
1775,0.97,9456.48,9466.089,"Finally, a November 2020 by two nurses who work with those with substantive disorders.",299,,
1776,0.97,9466.089,9467.124,Speaking of safety.,299,,
1777,0.97,9467.124,9469.66,Cs are not likely to lead to more crime.,299,,
1778,0.97,9469.66,9473.931,And they are more likely to seek help for substance disorder.,299,,
1779,0.97,9473.931,9486.643,"In a study of over 1,000 injection drug users in Canada, referral to treatment increased by 30% in the first year after an Scs opened in their community.",299,,
1780,0.97,9486.643,9488.712,Thank you.,299,,
1781,0.97,9488.712,9490.647,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",300,,

1783,0.97,9493.016,9493.417,I'm seeing none.,300,,
1784,0.97,9493.417,9497.054,"I want to thank you, council member Herbold.",300,,

1787,0.97,9503.16,9510.968,"And I really think that this is going to be a long day, but really informative for the public.",300,,
1788,0.97,9510.968,9514.605,"So again, thank you Councilmember Herbold for that Data-Driven answer.",300,,
1789,0.97,9514.605,9522.546,"Seeing no additional hands on this item, Madam clerk, will you please call the roll?",300,,

1821,0.97,9603.593,9605.062,Thank you.,324,,
1822,0.97,9605.062,9613.07,The next item that was removed from the package was item 113 on the agenda.,324,,
1823,0.97,9613.07,9615.005,That is Spd9A3.,324,,
1824,0.97,9615.005,9620.877,This would cut $6.18 million from the police Department from vacancy savings.,324,,
1825,0.97,9620.877,9626.65,Add to that general reserves for Participatory budgeting and imposes a proviso.,324,,
1826,0.97,9626.65,9627.718,This is sponsored by Councilmember Gonzalez.,324,,
1827,0.97,9627.718,9630.287,"Thank you very much, Coucilmember Pedersen.",325,,
1828,0.97,9630.287,9634.057,Would you like to speak to concerns or comment.,325,,
1829,0.97,9634.057,9636.293,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",326,,
1830,0.97,9636.293,9642.733,So I know we've all been diving deep into how to Reimagine public safety.,326,,
1831,0.97,9642.733,9644.568,And there is much work to be done.,326,,
1832,0.97,9644.568,9656.58,We cannot go back to the way it was there were actually protestors at my house moments ago.,326,,
1833,0.97,9656.58,9657.08,I'm at City Hall.,326,,
1834,0.97,9657.08,9658.682,But they were there at my home.,326,,
1835,0.97,9658.682,9663.12,"But you know, it just speaks to the desire to see change.",326,,
1836,0.97,9663.12,9667.624,And we are making a lot of changes in this budget.,326,,
1837,0.97,9667.624,9678.235,"I believe the key, though, is when I talk to constituents, I get a variety of views on public safety, on policing.",326,,
1838,0.97,9678.235,9682.706,And the issue is that people want positive change.,326,,
1839,0.97,9682.706,9689.246,They also want to have that plan in place.,326,,
1840,0.97,9689.246,9690.047,They want to see Reinvestments.,326,,
1841,0.97,9690.047,9694.918,But they want to have a community alternative scaled up first in most cases.,326,,
1842,0.97,9694.918,9702.159,So there are several budget actions today that would reduce funding to the Seattle police Department.,326,,
1843,0.97,9702.159,9704.528,"And that would, you know, with the aim of reinvesting.",326,,
1844,0.97,9704.528,9707.597,There are a couple of items that I pulled out.,326,,
1845,0.97,9707.597,9710.467,Because I just personally had concerns about them.,326,,
1846,0.97,9710.467,9713.57,And will be voting no on both of them.,326,,
1847,0.97,9713.57,9723.18,One is to the first item is the $6.1 million vacancy savings.,326,,
1848,0.97,9723.18,9740.23,"Those funds would be, it would be helpful before we take that money away, to understand what the rate of attrition is, going forward, to make sure that we don't have the force reduced below the number that we had originally anticipated.",326,,
1849,0.97,9740.23,9744.701,Attrition is already happening at a faster rate than we had anticipated.,326,,
1850,0.97,9744.701,9750.507,So this money is available to help staff 911 response.,326,,
1851,0.97,9750.507,9770.026,"The memo, the budget action says, should additional currently unanticipated vacancies, affect SPD's 911 Responder force, the Department would need to answer fewer 911 calls or respond more slowly to 911 calls.",326,,
1852,0.97,9770.026,9774.598,Or Backfill 911 officers vacancy through the transfer from investigative or specialty units.,326,,
1853,0.97,9774.598,9776.166,I am just expressing concern with that.,326,,
1854,0.97,9776.166,9789.312,I look forward to the Participatory budgeting process and the community alternatives that come out of that to prevent crime to increase public safety and community wellness.,326,,
1855,0.97,9789.312,9789.813,I support this effort.,326,,
1856,0.97,9789.813,9794.317,The other item that I was concerned about was --,326,,
1857,0.97,9794.317,9794.885,Councilmember Pedersen.,327,,
1858,0.97,9794.885,9802.826,I'm going to ask that we do it one at a time because we need to take the votes one at a time?,327,,
1859,0.97,9802.826,9803.093,Sure.,328,,
1860,0.97,9803.093,9806.229,Does that conclude your presentation?,329,,
1861,0.97,9806.229,9806.463,Yes.,330,,
1862,0.97,9806.463,9813.27,"Councilmember Gonzalez, would you like to speak to this item that you have sponsored?",331,,
1863,0.97,9813.27,9813.57,Yes.,332,,
1864,0.97,9813.57,9813.804,Sorry.,332,,
1865,0.97,9813.804,9816.139,Took me a minute.,332,,
1866,0.97,9816.139,9822.679,I Wassing tooling--I was Toggling between screens.,332,,
1867,0.97,9822.679,9825.982,Thank you for pulling this item out for further discussion.,332,,
1868,0.97,9825.982,9829.586,Of course we've discussed this particular item quite a bit in committee.,332,,
1869,0.97,9829.586,9832.989,So I won't Belabor the points.,332,,
1870,0.97,9832.989,9842.465,"But Unfortunately, I think Council member Pedersen continues to misunderstand or not clearly understand what this budget action actually is doing in the context of our full budget.",332,,
1871,0.97,9842.465,9852.809,So I'm just going to quickly explain for the benefit of the public and to make sure that it's clear what we are doing here.,332,,
1872,0.97,9852.809,9864.02,So that there isn't any confusion or misinformation about the effect of this particular Council budget action.,332,,
1873,0.97,9864.02,9869.092,So this Council budget action does cut $6.1 million from SPD's budget.,332,,
1874,0.97,9869.092,9882.539,"However, what we are cutting here are literally dollars that SPD has said, they will not use for purposes of hiring additional officers.",332,,
1875,0.97,9882.539,9900.29,"So the $6.1 million represents the total amount of dollars that we can expect in salary savings, for sworn officer positions that are currently RA cant and will remain vacant in 2021.",332,,
1876,0.97,9900.29,9904.427,"According to SPD's own staffing model, which includes in that formula.",332,,
1877,0.97,9904.427,9906.229,How many people they expect to hire.,332,,
1878,0.97,9906.229,9908.365,How many people they expect to lose.,332,,
1879,0.97,9908.365,9913.536,This is how many bodies they expect to have in 2021.,332,,
1880,0.97,9913.536,9921.912,"And so what we have done here, through the benefit of the analysis of Council central staff.",332,,
1881,0.97,9921.912,9936.76,And data received from SPD staffing model is to really acknowledge that Spdsproposed budget in this area is--was proposed too large.,332,,
1882,0.97,9936.76,9949.606,And this is a correction of that line item to accurately reflect what SPD's own data says they will be able to do in 2021.,332,,
1883,0.97,9949.606,9952.409,"So this is sort of, as I've thought about it in my head.",332,,
1884,0.97,9952.409,9954.444,It's like when I go to the grocery store.,332,,
1885,0.97,9954.444,9956.079,And I buy more than what I need.,332,,
1886,0.97,9956.079,9960.617,And so it's sort of like my eyes are hungrier than my stomach moment.,332,,
1887,0.97,9960.617,9964.721,And I think that that is what we're doing here in this instance.,332,,
1888,0.97,9964.721,9972.562,So we are not further reducing personnel at SPD.,332,,
1889,0.97,9972.562,9981.538,"We are not unnecessarily cutting into the opportunity for SPD to Backfill in attrition, that they experienced.",332,,
1890,0.97,9981.538,9982.072,That they didn't expect.,332,,
1891,0.97,9982.072,9988.244,What we are doing is we are saying that this is--that they have budgeted too much for this.,332,,
1892,0.97,9988.244,9990.647,And they're not going to use these dollars.,332,,
1893,0.97,9990.647,9992.916,They're literally going to be just sitting there.,332,,
1894,0.97,9992.916,10013.503,"And in the context of needing dollars in this tremendous recession, for other Council budget priorities, it is appropriate for us to engage--to move this correction forward, to capture the $6.1 million that SPD has said they will have no use for.",332,,
1895,0.97,10013.503,10015.372,Because they cannot realistically hire what they said.,332,,
1896,0.97,10015.372,10020.443,Or thought they were going to hire when the budget was transmitted.,332,,
1897,0.97,10020.443,10026.616,And to Reappropriate those to Community-Based needs that we have identified through our budget process.,332,,
1898,0.97,10026.616,10029.886,So that's what this Council budget action does.,332,,
1899,0.97,10029.886,10038.995,Ask it should not be read as though this is cutting into--cutting into existing positions at SPD.,332,,
1900,0.97,10038.995,10039.763,Thank you.,332,,
1901,0.97,10039.763,10042.899,"Thank you very much, Council President.",333,,
1902,0.97,10042.899,10047.303,"Are there any additional comments upon this item, number 113?",333,,
1903,0.97,10047.303,10047.837,Council member Herbold.,333,,
1904,0.97,10047.837,10050.106,Please go ahead.,333,,
1905,0.97,10050.106,10059.916,"I just want to underscore that during the budget process, the Council regularly adjusts the police Department's budget in line with the staffing plan.",334,,
1906,0.97,10059.916,10066.089,I believe this is done in prior years.,334,,
1907,0.97,10066.089,10072.395,"Including under the leadership of Councilmember, Council President Gonzalez, when she was chair of the budget committee.",334,,
1908,0.97,10072.395,10101.558,"And I think it's also--I just want to again, underscore that it is the police Department's staffing plan itself, that shows that the Department will continue to hire new recruits in the number of Fully-Trained officers will be--will correspond to the number of officers that this budget action maintains in the city budget.",334,,
1909,0.97,10101.558,10107.163,This analysis has been confirmed by our own central staff.,334,,
1910,0.97,10107.163,10118.041,"And the other important point to make is that if we did not do this, and these funds were left over, as we're anticipating.",334,,
1911,0.97,10118.041,10126.783,"And unable to be used to hire more officers, the result would be that the executive would decide how to spend those funds.",334,,
1912,0.97,10126.783,10131.855,And we are directing these funds to be used as part of the Participatory budgeting process.,334,,
1913,0.97,10131.855,10133.69,Thank you.,334,,
1914,0.97,10133.69,10134.023,Excellent.,335,,

1917,0.97,10140.864,10148.771,"Seeing none, Council President Gonzalez, would you like to move to consider this item back as part of the consent package.",335,,
1918,0.97,10148.771,10150.507,I'm happy to.,336,,
1919,0.97,10150.507,10153.143,I would like to move that item number --,336,,
1920,0.97,10153.143,10155.445,I am a little confused as to the procedure.,337,,
1921,0.97,10155.445,10158.081,I thought once it was pulled.,337,,
1922,0.97,10158.081,10160.617,We just do an individual vote?,337,,
1923,0.97,10160.617,10161.518,Okay.,338,,
1924,0.97,10161.518,10162.719,Thumbs up.,338,,

1926,0.97,10174.23,10176.399,Then we do an individual vote.,338,,
1927,0.97,10176.399,10177.066,Does that work?,338,,
1928,0.97,10177.066,10177.333,Yes.,339,,
1929,0.97,10177.333,10179.602,Is there a second some.,340,,

1963,0.97,10246.035,10248.538,You are on your left item that you have pulled here.,364,,
1964,0.97,10248.538,10254.577,"And Patty, do you mind doing a quick favor?",364,,
1965,0.97,10254.577,10261.017,Can you Toggle over so we can see the CDA number.,364,,
1966,0.97,10261.017,10263.686,Thank you very much.,364,,
1967,0.97,10263.686,10264.22,Council member Pedersen.,364,,
1968,0.97,10264.22,10264.787,Please go ahead.,364,,
1969,0.97,10264.787,10270.426,Thank you this is the item that would Abroigate 93.,365,,
1970,0.97,10270.426,10276.699,"And similar to the concerns I raised earlier, I feel that we want to have the full public safety plan.",365,,
1971,0.97,10276.699,10286.342,"We want to have the alternatives sketched out more fully, in terms of increasing public safety and community wellness.",365,,
1972,0.97,10286.342,10293.616,"And you know, we're going to have that process unfold.",365,,
1973,0.97,10293.616,10303.359,"And the Abigating of positions, you know, while there is a go rationale for deep funding.",365,,
1974,0.97,10303.359,10306.462,This reduces the position.,365,,
1975,0.97,10306.462,10307.73,And that unnecessarily reduces the flexibility.,365,,
1976,0.97,10307.73,10311.634,For what the chief and the Mayor have intended.,365,,
1977,0.97,10311.634,10314.57,I believe they Abigated 47 of the positions.,365,,
1978,0.97,10314.57,10316.472,But this is going to Abrogate more of them.,365,,
1979,0.97,10316.472,10327.617,"And I believe we want to have that flexibility of having those positions still on the books, even if they are not funded in case they're needed again.",365,,
1980,0.97,10327.617,10328.885,We're also seeing attrition occur at a faster rate.,365,,
1981,0.97,10328.885,10331.487,Thank you.,365,,
1982,0.97,10331.487,10334.19,"Thank you, Council President Gonzalez.",366,,
1983,0.97,10334.19,10337.493,"As the sponsor, would you like to add any additional information?",366,,
1984,0.97,10337.493,10337.76,Again.,367,,
1985,0.97,10337.76,10342.098,"This is one that we've discussed quite a bit, during our budget committee processes.",367,,
1986,0.97,10342.098,10353.076,And I just--I guess I disagree with Councilmember Pedersen's characterization of the effect of this particular budget action item.,367,,
1987,0.97,10353.076,10357.647,And on the impact it would have on the Department.,367,,
1988,0.97,10357.647,10365.788,So this budget action would eliminate the position pockets for all sworn officer positions at SPD that are currently vacant.,367,,
1989,0.97,10365.788,10366.122,And unfunded.,367,,
1990,0.97,10366.122,10372.595,"So these are positions that are just sitting there, on the shelf, and have no money.",367,,
1991,0.97,10372.595,10377.867,So even if SPD said we have all of this attrition.,367,,
1992,0.97,10377.867,10386.843,"And we need to Rehire people, they would not be able to Rehire them into these particular abrogated positions.",367,,
1993,0.97,10386.843,10392.215,Because there is no salary associated with each of these positions.,367,,
1994,0.97,10392.215,10399.288,So if the scenario that Councilmember Pedersen describes comes to fruition.,367,,
1995,0.97,10399.288,10399.822,Spd.,367,,
1996,0.97,10399.822,10411.868,"Even if we didn't Abroigate these positions, would need to come to Council to request funding for each of those extra positions before they could hire into those slots.",367,,
1997,0.97,10411.868,10417.974,So this budget action does not have any impact on existing police officer positions.,367,,
1998,0.97,10417.974,10426.983,It also does not impact SPD's current staffing or hiring plan for 2021 as they've proposed.,367,,
1999,0.97,10426.983,10432.955,This budget action would restrict SPD from hiring above and beyond their current projected staffing and hiring plan.,367,,
2000,0.97,10432.955,10444.066,"So in other words, it prevents the Department from growing the force in the future in a way that is inconsistent with their own current staffing and hiring plan.",367,,
2001,0.97,10444.066,10457.68,"If SPD does try to increase the size of the sworn officer force in the future, they would need this Council or a future Council to take legislative and budgetary action to authorize any additional positions.",367,,
2002,0.97,10457.68,10466.823,"And SPD has indicated that the Abroigation of these positions in particular, the 93 positions, does not affect their staffing plan for 2021.",367,,
2003,0.97,10466.823,10473.729,"And again, as a reminder, their staffing plan takes into Considration their projection ever how many officers it can hire.",367,,
2004,0.97,10473.729,10479.135,"How many they believe they will lose to attrition, including retirement.",367,,
2005,0.97,10479.135,10482.438,And what the net result of that will be.,367,,
2006,0.97,10482.438,10489.278,"And so based on their own evaluation, these positions will not affect their staffing plan for 2021.",367,,
2007,0.97,10489.278,10499.322,"And so I think it is a responsible move, at this point, to eliminate these 93 officer positions.",367,,
2008,0.97,10499.322,10509.165,Portion of the 93 that are included in here were already proposed by the Mayor's office to be eliminated.,367,,
2009,0.97,10509.165,10522.578,"And in the event that there is a need for additional positions after the Mayor's task force related to functional analysis is completed, which again Council has a seat at that table.",367,,
2010,0.97,10522.578,10523.513,After that is completed.,367,,
2011,0.97,10523.513,10537.226,"If there is a need to further adjust what pockets are available for police officer positions and SPD, then I believe that would be the appropriate time to consider Reinstituting or reinstating these positions.",367,,
2012,0.97,10537.226,10544.0,I suspect that that will not be what an outcome of that functional analysis would be telling us.,367,,
2013,0.97,10544.0,10559.348,"But I think for right now, this is kind of a no harm, no foul proposal here and would request that my colleagues support item number 116, Spd0B very 02.",367,,
2014,0.97,10559.348,10561.684,I'm happy to make the motion.,367,,
2015,0.97,10561.684,10565.555,Or I'll defer to the chair to make the motion.,367,,

2019,0.97,10568.457,10571.56,I just realized I cut off the bait unintentionally.,369,,
2020,0.97,10571.56,10575.798,I didn't see a hand I do see one now.,370,,
2021,0.97,10575.798,10576.966,"Go ahead, Councilmember Herbold.",370,,
2022,0.97,10576.966,10577.333,Thank you.,371,,
2023,0.97,10577.333,10581.003,I just want to concur with Council President Gonzalez.,371,,
2024,0.97,10581.003,10583.439,"Again, the former chair of the public safety committee.",371,,
2025,0.97,10583.439,10585.608,Appreciate her leading on this.,371,,

2027,0.97,10587.51,10592.181,"I think a good practice, not Justas it relates.",371,,
2028,0.97,10592.181,10601.39,"A good budgeting practice and a good policy oversight role for the Council, regardless of what Department you're talking about.",371,,
2029,0.97,10601.39,10604.126,This Aligns the staffing plan.,371,,
2030,0.97,10604.126,10610.766,And the Ftes with positions by removing positions that aren't filled and are not expected to be filled.,371,,
2031,0.97,10610.766,10618.074,We do this in other Didn'Ts in our oversight role as well.,371,,
2032,0.97,10618.074,10625.548,A responsible budgeting practice is to have staffing aligned with the Ftes listed in the budget.,371,,
2033,0.97,10625.548,10628.284,It allows for clear public understanding.,371,,
2034,0.97,10628.284,10631.22,Lack of alignment for these numbers is an ongoing issue.,371,,
2035,0.97,10631.22,10645.601,"Again, it's an ongoing issue not just for the police Department but for many other departments where there's an executive practice of having unfilled positions.",371,,
2036,0.97,10645.601,10655.678,And that that doesn't allow the Council to exercise its oversight role in determining the form and function of the activities of the Department.,371,,
2037,0.97,10655.678,10658.814,Thank you.,371,,

2069,0.97,10724.513,10725.181,The motion carries.,394,,
2070,0.97,10725.181,10730.052,And item Spd12B002 is included in our consent package.,394,,
2071,0.97,10730.052,10731.053,From group A.,394,,
2072,0.97,10731.053,10734.724,I think those are all the items that had been removed.,394,,
2073,0.97,10734.724,10739.662,"That does officially get us through group A. thank you very much, colleagues, for the discussion.",394,,
2074,0.97,10739.662,10742.765,We have about a half hour left of this morning's session.,394,,
2075,0.97,10742.765,10745.901,And I'm going to ask that we move into reviewing group B.,394,,
2076,0.97,10745.901,10748.637,Thanks so much for your time here today.,394,,
2077,0.97,10748.637,10751.54,I'm going to keep my comments very short.,394,,
2078,0.97,10751.54,10760.015,"Really just want to say thanks again to all of our staff, who have been working around the clock.",394,,
2079,0.97,10760.015,10762.685,"Aly, Mike, Patty Wargon for the work over the weekend.",394,,
2080,0.97,10762.685,10777.533,"The last week or two, making a tremendous amount of requests fit into a possible amended consent package for your consideration as we look at group B.",394,,
2081,0.97,10777.533,10788.11,There is really magic work happening here to make sure that various priorities that serve the most vulnerable.,394,,
2082,0.97,10788.11,10790.513,"Seniors, those living Houseless.",394,,
2083,0.97,10790.513,10790.946,Working families.,394,,
2084,0.97,10790.946,10792.581,Small businesses got additional support here.,394,,
2085,0.97,10792.581,10796.652,"We have incorporated as you know, many of the items.",394,,
2086,0.97,10796.652,10798.354,We left approximately $2 million in reserve.,394,,
2087,0.97,10798.354,10801.056,So that we can dig into getting additional support.,394,,
2088,0.97,10801.056,10805.06,And with the goal of trying to keep those reserves as high as possible.,394,,
2089,0.97,10805.06,10811.5,We have been able to keep those at approximately $40 million.,394,,
2090,0.97,10811.5,10812.234,Just under $40 million.,394,,
2091,0.97,10812.234,10817.373,"I mentioned this morning, the importance of building back that reserve that was near zero.",394,,
2092,0.97,10817.373,10818.507,About $3 million in reserve.,394,,
2093,0.97,10818.507,10824.18,"To make sure that those investments are available, especially for our communities.",394,,
2094,0.97,10824.18,10825.347,And the economic recession.,394,,
2095,0.97,10825.347,10835.457,I think what we have done here is a very responsible effort to try to identify additional priorities to compliment the form 8 items we just talked about.,394,,
2096,0.97,10835.457,10839.695,And we have continued to maintain that commitment and that investment in the reserves.,394,,
2097,0.97,10839.695,10841.33,We had a lot of form cs.,394,,
2098,0.97,10841.33,10851.14,"You can imagine the challenge of trying to get over 50 form cs, into approximately a $6 million new spend slot.",394,,
2099,0.97,10851.14,10858.113,"But as we'll be discussing today, our attempts to do this have, I think, carefully balanced out.",394,,
2100,0.97,10858.113,10859.782,We've identified where funding is available.,394,,
2101,0.97,10859.782,10867.823,"And we continue to, I think, strike a healthy balance in terms of commitments to reserves and key investments for communities.",394,,
2102,0.97,10867.823,10869.725,So it's obviously been a tremendous amount of work.,394,,
2103,0.97,10869.725,10876.232,And I'll turn it over to Aly to turn it over to group B items here.,394,,
2104,0.97,10876.232,10876.799,"This time, colleagues.",394,,
2105,0.97,10876.799,10879.134,We're going to walk through each item.,394,,
2106,0.97,10879.134,10885.241,Since many of these items have been discussed and some of them have been discussed in public.,394,,
2107,0.97,10885.241,10887.376,But some of them haven't.,394,,
2108,0.97,10887.376,10888.043,They're somewhat new proposals.,394,,
2109,0.97,10888.043,10893.782,I'm going to pause at the end of each one for a discussion or questions if you have it.,394,,
2110,0.97,10893.782,10898.454,And you can identify one by one if you need to pull it.,394,,
2111,0.97,10898.454,10904.693,But I would encourage folks to try to see the whole package before pulling.,394,,
2112,0.97,10904.693,10907.63,We are going to go to--actually.,394,,
2113,0.97,10907.63,10908.097,Let me Rephrase that.,394,,
2114,0.97,10908.097,10913.168,I'm going to ask that you wait until we get through the whole list of items.,394,,
2115,0.97,10913.168,10916.939,And then if there's an item that you would like to pull at the end.,394,,
2116,0.97,10916.939,10920.142,Let's pull it after a full discussion.,394,,
2117,0.97,10920.142,10921.01,"Again, we'll pause for questions.",394,,
2118,0.97,10921.01,10922.745,Conversation about each item.,394,,
2119,0.97,10922.745,10923.812,This is not a debate necessarily.,394,,
2120,0.97,10923.812,10929.718,"Just to make sure that you have a better understanding, if you think it warrants a debate.",394,,
2121,0.97,10929.718,10933.589,Or if there is any concern about including it in a consent package.,394,,
2122,0.97,10933.589,10935.658,"After the items, you can then pull it at the end.",394,,
2123,0.97,10935.658,10938.594,Okay?,394,,
2124,0.97,10938.594,10939.261,Not seeing any questions.,394,,
2125,0.97,10939.261,10939.495,Great.,394,,

2130,0.97,10946.302,10950.306,Group B includes items 126 through 160 on the agenda.,395,,
2131,0.97,10950.306,10962.117,"As the chair noted, these items are either brand new proposals or are modified options of amendments that were presented to the Committee on November 10th.",395,,
2132,0.97,10962.117,10971.427,"Because they are newer revised items, I'm going to ask the lead analyst.",396,,
2133,0.97,10971.427,10977.232,Beyond just reading in the title the first items are presented by Calvin chow.,396,,
2134,0.97,10977.232,10980.436,And they relate to the Department of transportation.,396,,
2135,0.97,10980.436,10985.808,"Before moving into these items, chair, I'd just like to clarify because we understood a few items might be removed.",396,,
2136,0.97,10985.808,10994.45,Would you like a more Detailedpresentation of items 126 and 127 now at this point in the agenda.,396,,
2137,0.97,10994.45,10994.817,Or --,396,,
2138,0.97,10994.817,10998.721,I think that it is fine to read them into the record.,397,,

2140,0.97,11000.556,11000.989,But early preview.,397,,

2142,0.97,11006.595,11008.364,It does sound like those are going to be removed.,397,,
2143,0.97,11008.364,11010.032,And we want to recognize them for the record.,397,,
2144,0.97,11010.032,11015.904,And we are going to have them identified for removal afternoon we get through the full list here.,397,,
2145,0.97,11015.904,11020.576,"But let's hold the longer presentation, Cal, for the discussion after the consent package on group B.",397,,

2156,0.97,11060.516,11062.317,It adds $5 million for capital.,400,,
2157,0.97,11062.317,11068.29,"Again, as approved by the vote.",400,,

2166,0.97,11091.547,11099.555,It would pass legislation that has been introduced to implement a $20 vehicle license fee increase.,404,,
2167,0.97,11099.555,11104.793,And it would add $3.6 million of those funds for bridge maintenance programs in Sdot.,404,,

2348,0.97,11881.269,11885.54,This ensures that the funds are set for the position this is intended to carry out.,441,,

2364,0.97,11928.549,11936.758,"As folks know, we have two investments that we're making directly into recommendations.",444,,

2370,0.97,11963.184,11972.694,"And this is simply that doing what the Mayor's office had requested, Front-Loading some of those Drz dollars to make them available.",444,,
2371,0.97,11972.694,11978.299,Releasing about half a million dollars for the ability to hire folks and get the process off the ground.,444,,

2388,0.97,12018.773,12027.982,Would cut $10.4 million general fund from Finance general for the equitable communities Commission.,447,,
2389,0.97,12027.982,12030.485,And $33.7 million from the fund.,447,,
2390,0.97,12030.485,12032.353,For finance transfer to the city's emergency Fund.,447,,
2391,0.97,12032.353,12041.763,By way of a little background after accounting for $19.8 million of spending for emergency funds for Covid relief efforts in 2020.,447,,
2392,0.97,12041.763,12049.637,"The 2021 proposed budget would deplete the emergency fund to nearly zero balance, about $60,000 in 2021.",447,,
2393,0.97,12049.637,12057.812,This budget action would then replenish the emergency fund balance to $33.8 million.,447,,
2394,0.97,12057.812,12066.554,Which can affect--Replenishes the majority of the funds that were used to support the programs and services in the joint Covid program in 2019 and 2021.,447,,

2396,0.97,12068.122,12071.526,And just to add one comment as we invest in the reserves.,448,,
2397,0.97,12071.526,12080.468,"This is how we invest in projecting the health and safety of our most vulnerable communities, both from the attacks of the public health crisis of Covid.",448,,
2398,0.97,12080.468,12083.004,And economic consequences that are being worsened because of that.,448,,
2399,0.97,12083.004,12090.077,And I see this as an important effort to make sure that we not only have the health and safety of our residents.,448,,
2400,0.97,12090.077,12092.18,First and foremost in our mind of the budget.,448,,
2401,0.97,12092.18,12101.589,But also be thinking about the ways in which we can provide additional financial support to families and small businesses in the upcoming year as we see things continue to worsen.,448,,
2402,0.97,12101.589,12104.258,So really proud of this piece.,448,,
2403,0.97,12104.258,12107.662,I feel like the investments that our reserves folks are not getting a ton of attention.,448,,
2404,0.97,12107.662,12112.066,And want to lift that up.,448,,
2405,0.97,12112.066,12113.301,Councilmember Herbold.,448,,
2406,0.97,12113.301,12115.269,Please go ahead.,448,,

2408,0.97,12116.304,12118.206,I want to thank you for attention to this item.,449,,
2409,0.97,12118.206,12119.974,You're correct.,449,,
2410,0.97,12119.974,12122.477,It's the replenishment of these funds is not getting a lot of attention.,449,,
2411,0.97,12122.477,12129.45,"What did get a lot of attention is over the summer, when we drew down these funds.",449,,
2412,0.97,12129.45,12150.204,"And because of our commitment to financial responsibility and fiscal oversight in preparing for our future, this Council made the commitment during the discussion around the jump start spending plan to replenish these funds in the 2021 budget.",449,,
2413,0.97,12150.204,12154.242,Thank you for making sure that the Council fulfilled this commitment.,449,,
2414,0.97,12154.242,12158.613,"Again, we took a lot of flak over the summer.",449,,
2415,0.97,12158.613,12168.923,And I just think that that is terrific that you are leading us in this effort to maintain our reserves in a way that we can prepare for our future.,449,,
2416,0.97,12168.923,12173.694,Thank you.,449,,
2417,0.97,12173.694,12174.795,"Council President, please go ahead.",450,,
2418,0.97,12174.795,12175.429,Thank you quickly.,451,,
2419,0.97,12175.429,12184.105,I want to echo the thanks in the remarks made by Councilmember Herbold.,451,,
2420,0.97,12184.105,12200.855,I also want to acknowledge there the Council did this with the understanding that there could be other shoes that drop as we continue to experience the realities of Covid-19.,451,,
2421,0.97,12200.855,12205.693,"A third spike here in Seattle, King County, and across the country.",451,,
2422,0.97,12205.693,12232.32,"And so as a result of that, we have now just in this sort of wait hour of our own budget process, have seen yet another set of restrictions, Reinstituted by Governor Inslee, that are going to have a really drastic negative effect on many of our small businesses and on the workers that they employed particularly, within the restaurant and bar industry.",451,,
2423,0.97,12232.32,12236.591,And so I think it was with good wisdom that we are reserving these.,451,,
2424,0.97,12236.591,12250.805,"And I also think that there is going to be a, in the near future need to deploy these dollars, given the late breaking news around the additional restrictions.",451,,
2425,0.97,12250.805,12263.217,So really appreciate the opportunity to have these emergency funds available for the emergencies that continue to be popped on us in the last minute.,451,,
2426,0.97,12263.217,12273.527,And look forward to having additional conversations about how we can utilize these funds to meet the emerging needs of people in our city.,451,,
2427,0.97,12273.527,12274.295,"Thank you, chair.",451,,

2441,0.97,12318.939,12324.078,"As Jeff said, this is a compilation of several Councilmembers' interest.",455,,
2442,0.97,12324.078,12329.784,I think what is important is that we will see new outreach workers across the city.,455,,
2443,0.97,12329.784,12349.336,"I believe four up North and three in the South end of Seattle, who will really provide a more robust network of experts to help us move toward the kind of homeless Innocenceness outreach that really centers the experts who be know how to do this request.",455,,
2444,0.97,12349.336,12357.712,"And at the same time, honors the humanity and respects the dignity of our homeless neighbors while they do that.",455,,

2452,0.97,12376.931,12394.448,"But more importantly, the social service nonprofit community groups and Faith- based groups all thank this Council for providing additional resources to provide on the ground resources, referral services for our unsheltered clients which is a long time coming.",459,,
2453,0.97,12394.448,12394.982,Thank you very much.,459,,

2460,0.97,12417.905,12419.073,Okay.,460,,

2468,0.97,12445.099,12459.78,The $2.1 million would support continued capacity to operate shelters in hotels and state of legislative intent is regarding the use of $23 million in the budget of emergency solutions grant Covid funds.,461,,
2469,0.97,12459.78,12466.12,That also would be utilized or propose to be utilized on hotel sheltering in 2021.,461,,
2470,0.97,12466.12,12471.091,This is put forward by Councilmember Morales.,461,,
2471,0.97,12471.091,12471.425,Thank you.,462,,
2472,0.97,12471.425,12471.992,And Councilmember Morales.,462,,
2473,0.97,12471.992,12475.129,I saw this piece as complementary to the item we just spoke about.,462,,
2474,0.97,12475.129,12476.897,If you would like to speak to this.,462,,
2475,0.97,12476.897,12479.834,Then we are going to go ahead and recess for lunch.,462,,
2476,0.97,12479.834,12480.1,Sure.,463,,

2478,0.97,12480.601,12489.043,And we've spoken a lot already about the hope program and how important it is to move toward a more Provider-Centered approach.,463,,
2479,0.97,12489.043,12500.487,"The difference between this and what we had already discussed is that--and we did add, as Jeff said, $2.1 million for the Noncongregate shelter, as we had been talking about.",463,,
2480,0.97,12500.487,12502.523,It's really important to do the outreach.,463,,
2481,0.97,12502.523,12506.36,But the next step is making sure there are places for people to go.,463,,
2482,0.97,12506.36,12531.118,"And so this sort of closes the Loop on that effort by putting money in so that we can both move people into hotels and maintain what, you know, the CDC is recommending, which is that as we move people off the street, into more stable shelter, that we do it in a way that ensures the Noncongregate setting.",463,,
2483,0.97,12531.118,12532.853,So I'm excited to be able to do this.,463,,
2484,0.97,12532.853,12537.091,And look forward to your support.,463,,
2485,0.97,12537.091,12540.861,Excellent.,464,,

2488,0.97,12542.796,12543.697,Thank you.,465,,
2489,0.97,12543.697,12553.274,I just want to share my deep appreciation for everybody who has been involved in the ongoing conversations that have been happening.,465,,
2490,0.97,12553.274,12555.776,To shape this budget process.,465,,
2491,0.97,12555.776,12558.112,But also to really shape not the budget process.,465,,
2492,0.97,12558.112,12562.917,But the budget proposal.,465,,
2493,0.97,12562.917,12570.891,"But more importantly, to reshape the encampment management and outreach to people living outdoors and in Encampments.",465,,
2494,0.97,12570.891,12577.932,And addressing the concerns of the House community that--and business community that are nearby.,465,,
2495,0.97,12577.932,12586.006,"My thanks go to providers and advocates, specifically reach D.E.S.C., public defenders Association.",465,,
2496,0.97,12586.006,12589.009,And Seattle King County coalition on homelessness.,465,,
2497,0.97,12589.009,12592.813,And deputy Mayor Sixskill in the Mayor's office.,465,,
2498,0.97,12592.813,12595.549,"And again, thanks to Councilmember Morales for leading this budget action.",465,,
2499,0.97,12595.549,12607.161,I think we really need to underscore that this is a problem-solving approach to replace the navigation team to provide outreach services.,465,,
2500,0.97,12607.161,12614.001,And actually not just information to encampment residents in neighbors.,465,,
