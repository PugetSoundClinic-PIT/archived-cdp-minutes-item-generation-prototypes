206,0.97,1340.372,1349.281,"Alternately, please reach out to my office now heading into the committee, or after the committee this week, rather than waiting for the 25th.",17,,
207,0.97,1349.281,1356.855,That will give Renters rights activists and community members the opportunity to respond to any questions or concerns that Councilmembers might have.,17,,
208,0.97,1356.855,1358.256,I look forward to that discussion.,17,,
209,0.97,1358.256,1364.763,Last Wednesday my office held a press conference along with around 40 Renters and Renters rights organizers.,17,,
210,0.97,1364.763,1371.47,In the central district outside this Coffeeshop in the heart of the central district.,17,,
211,0.97,1371.47,1375.707,To announce a package of Renters rights legislation that our movement will be fighting for this year.,17,,
212,0.97,1375.707,1388.72,The Renters rights bill from my office that are currently in committee are to close the fixed term lease low poll and the just cause ordinance that I just mentioned.,17,,
213,0.97,1388.72,1391.39,And to ban Evictions of schoolchildren and educators and staff during the school year.,17,,
214,0.97,1391.39,1404.936,"My office has also now to the press conference, a draft of two additional bills along with other Renters rights that we have described, but we are still working on the draft legislation for those.",17,,
215,0.97,1404.936,1417.549,"The drafts that we have built from my office on Wednesday include, including the notice landlords need to give Renters for rent increases to 180 days, the current law is 60 days.",17,,
216,0.97,1417.549,1427.926,Requiring landlords to pay relocation assistance to their tenants if they economically displaced their tenants by increasing the rent so much that the tenants have to move.,17,,
217,0.97,1427.926,1433.231,"Residential rent control without corporate loopholes, limiting rent increases to the rate of inflation.",17,,
218,0.97,1433.231,1442.474,"As landlords costs increase and Renters wages increase, rents can increase under such a law, but no faster than that rate.",17,,
219,0.97,1442.474,1456.588,"Rent increases, rent increases of 10%, 20%, 50%, 100%, even over 100%, which is not unheard of, should be illegal, and that is what this bill should do.",17,,
220,0.97,1456.588,1468.767,"Of course, the Democratic and Republican parties in Olympia have banned rent control for the last 41 years, so our bill has an effective date that have rent control going into effect in the city the moment the state LIFTS the band.",17,,
221,0.97,1468.767,1482.18,"The reality is, if the city council passes this legislation in Seattle, it will put enormous pressure on state legislatures--legislators to let the brand on residential rent control.",17,,
222,0.97,1482.18,1493.525,"Again, Councilmembers who support any of these issues, or have questions, and have insight on this, that we should please let my office know about this.",17,,
223,0.97,1493.525,1497.195,We are going to be happy to work with you on any of those drafts.,17,,
224,0.97,1497.195,1507.138,"In addition to the legislation that my office unveiled on Wednesday, we are also going to be working on other Renters rights demands that our movement announced at the press conference.",17,,
225,0.97,1507.138,1515.647,"One is commercial rent control without corporate loopholes, because we know Seattle's struggling small businesses need commercial rent control.",17,,
226,0.97,1515.647,1521.953,The city council can pass this law right now as they're not are no legal obstacles.,17,,
227,0.97,1521.953,1529.261,It is also a lot of these Renters rights also relate to the larger question of the debt that has been accumulated by working-class Renters and homeowners.,17,,
228,0.97,1529.261,1546.945,Many speakers at the press conference also highlighted the need to spilled a statewide movement to cancel Covid that for people who are struggling under the effect of the pandemic and the recession that we have experienced all of last year.,17,,
229,0.97,1546.945,1552.35,"Big business should pay for this crisis, networking people.",17,,
230,0.97,1552.35,1561.793,We are also working on bringing legislation to stop default Evictions to bolster the victory that our movement won in April for every tenant to have a lawyer.,17,,
231,0.97,1561.793,1574.205,"Half of all convictions in Seattle happen by default the court automatically he picks the Renter because they were unable to fill out the paperwork to request a hearing, or did not attend the hearing.",17,,
232,0.97,1574.205,1575.807,This is unfortunately half of all Evictions.,17,,
233,0.97,1575.807,1585.116,We do need to bolster the right to counsel victory by also stopping default Evictions.,17,,
234,0.97,1585.116,1591.022,We are also bringing a legislation to create standardized lease terms.,17,,
235,0.97,1591.022,1594.693,"In other words to create fair, standardized terms for rent releases.",17,,
236,0.97,1594.693,1606.237,"Many leases currently use Templates created by the landlord lobby, and have outrageous terms, often leases attempt to make Renters sign away their legal rights as Renters.",17,,
237,0.97,1606.237,1621.119,"And one common example that we heard many times during the black lives matter protests last year was, corporate landlords not allowing their tenants to have Blm signs on their windows or otherwise on their home fronts.",17,,
238,0.97,1621.119,1634.466,"We also believe the city should maintain a listing of completed Renter history so that a Renter who has had a current background check, or one apartment application, can use that background check for other apartment applications.",17,,
239,0.97,1634.466,1637.569,"In other words, for the city to enable transferable Renter histories.",17,,
240,0.97,1637.569,1640.972,"Last but not least, to ban the use of credit checks.",17,,
241,0.97,1640.972,1649.147,"Most rental histories do not require a credit check because in reality, credit checks available bearing actually on whether a prospective tenant will pay their rent.",17,,
242,0.97,1649.147,1664.195,"We've heard from many Renters who say they have never missed paying rent, even once, but if you look at their credit check, that would reflect the stability that they have insured to make sure that their landlord is paid every month.",17,,
243,0.97,1664.195,1675.106,I think it's important for the Seattle Renters Commission to propose that Seattle prohibit the use of credit checks and rental histories calling them essentially a modern form of Redlining.,17,,
244,0.97,1675.106,1695.627,I also wanted to use a few minutes in this briefing to speak in favor of preserving the older Creek nature area in district 3. my office has heard from many people who live near Alder Creek who are extremely concerned that one of their neighbors is attempting to build a driveway across the nature area.,17,,
245,0.97,1695.627,1706.638,That neighbor has applied to the Department of transportation and then to the Department of construction and inspections for the building permits.,17,,
246,0.97,1706.638,1709.641,The comment period for those building permits and did last week.,17,,
247,0.97,1709.641,1728.56,"This is a type II administrative decision, so it does not come to the city council for any action, however my office was copied on the comment neighbors sent in . I was really struck by how widespread the concern about this development is.",17,,
248,0.97,1728.56,1740.138,"My office was copied on over 100 Emails from concerned neighbors, and these are community members who have put in countless volunteer hours to attend to and preserve the creek.",17,,
249,0.97,1740.138,1765.897,"I understand that this specific decisions are made by the departments and not by the city Council, however I did want to take this opportunity to urge the Department of transportation and construction and inspections to do what they can to work with these neighbors who care so deeply about preserving Alder Creek to find solutions to this and future such issues that might Ipact the natural area there.",17,,
250,0.97,1765.897,1771.569,"I also wanted to publicly thank the many, many community members we have spoken up about this in defense of the nature area.",17,,
251,0.97,1771.569,1784.616,"Finally, there is important news on the struggle to demand the WTO issue, and international copyright Eber for the Covid-19 vaccine.",17,,
252,0.97,1784.616,1799.03,"Since the city council passed a resolution from my office two weeks ago, as I mentioned at that time, that resolution was one small part of a giant organizing effort across the country and internationally.",17,,
253,0.97,1799.03,1805.136,"We did help move that movement, and following the resolution that was passed by the city Council, we held a protest outside the bill and Melinda gates foundation.",17,,
254,0.97,1805.136,1807.138,There were many speakers.,17,,
255,0.97,1807.138,1814.646,They talked about the need to have the ability of countries to produce a generic version of the Covid-19 vaccine.,17,,
256,0.97,1814.646,1819.951,So that billions of people have access to the vaccine.,17,,
257,0.97,1819.951,1821.553,In order to save millions of lives.,17,,
258,0.97,1821.553,1838.67,"After the resolution was passed by the city Council, the resolution here in Seattle, a resolution was passed by the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, which the Dsa elected official who brought that resolution forward said publicly that they were inspired by the resolution that was brought forward in Seattle.",17,,
259,0.97,1838.67,1845.977,From my office and from the activists for the generic vaccine.,17,,
260,0.97,1845.977,1850.048,"We've also had Councilmembers in Chicago who have considered, or started to consider doing the same.",17,,
261,0.97,1850.048,1860.792,"We of course know that last week, the Biden administration conceded and agreed to support the waiver, because of the tremendous pressure that they have been under.",17,,
262,0.97,1860.792,1868.9,"Which is a really big victory for the activists, not only in Seattle and the United States, but globally.",17,,
263,0.97,1868.9,1871.97,"Because the United States is Needless to say, a very powerful entity in the WTO.",17,,
264,0.97,1871.97,1874.205,"However, they should not have.",17,,
265,0.97,1874.205,1882.714,"We know that the WTO operates on a consensus basis, obviously not the consensus of ordinary people around the world but imperialist powers.",17,,
266,0.97,1882.714,1895.126,"We have seen that even after the announcement from the Biden administration, the European Parliament especially considered by countries like Germany consider to import it.",17,,
267,0.97,1895.126,1908.539,"This concession from the Biden administration was still a huge step toward creating opportunity for Covid vaccines, but this is also a reminder, the opposition of the European Parliament is a reminder that this is not been won yet.",17,,
268,0.97,1908.539,1916.247,"For the waivers to happen, we need the WTO as a whole to concede on this, and activists still have work on their hands.",17,,
269,0.97,1916.247,1930.361,"I also mentioned that is not incidental that the inventor of the first polio vaccine, Jonas Salk, intentionally chose not to patent it just so in order to make it as easy as possible to vaccinate the entire world.",17,,
270,0.97,1930.361,1935.967,That was essential in preventing the spread of polio and for Eradicating it from wide sections of the world.,17,,
271,0.97,1935.967,1940.638,Many of course are direct beneficiaries from the polio vaccine.,17,,
272,0.97,1940.638,1953.584,"Hopefully the International movement keeps building in order to win the intellectual property waivers from the WTO, but it's also important to note that Cuba has reported that they are in the final stage three of the clinical testing of the vaccine.",17,,
273,0.97,1953.584,1960.491,Cuba has of course had a long history of providing free medical support to every country that is in need.,17,,

355,0.97,2466.497,2476.207,"I do want to thank everybody for patiently getting through our long, but very productive, meeting of the committee last Thursday.",21,,
356,0.97,2476.207,2498.996,"Where we discussed a variety of really critical, pressing issues that are facing our community from the need to stand up more hygiene assets, to confront the ongoing challenges with hepatitis A. in our community through increased access to running water and street SINKS.",21,,
357,0.97,2498.996,2517.114,"Two issues with our homelessness outreach and shelter systems, and the future expansion of those systems even further with the potential of a third hotel and additional tiny House villages being sent out for request for proposal.",21,,
358,0.97,2517.114,2529.059,"Just as a reminder, we will have an additional select committee meeting this month on May 26th at 2:00 P.M.",21,,
359,0.97,2529.059,2536.967,I expect follow-up on a variety of things where committee questions were asked and answers were not readily available.,21,,
360,0.97,2536.967,2548.779,"So, that does provide us a good, quick turnaround to get some answers on some of those critical questions pertaining to one of the most Omnipresent and ongoing issues that we are facing in the city.",21,,
361,0.97,2548.779,2556.086,I did want to highlight a couple of additional things.,21,,
362,0.97,2556.086,2572.102,"Subsequent to the committee, on Friday, I had the great privilege of taking a tour of the Seattle waterfront to see the progress that is being made by the Department of the waterfront with director Marshall Faulk Sir.",21,,
363,0.97,2572.102,2580.878,I just wanted to give a shout out and say I appreciated the director taking the time and showing me around.,21,,
364,0.97,2580.878,2585.916,"I have the opportunity to visit for the first time, peer 62, which is a very impressive public access.",21,,
365,0.97,2585.916,2608.105,"I notice, just to bring it back, some of the conversation on the select committee, a honey bucket sink that was least, has been leased by Seattle public utilities that is on 62.",21,,
366,0.97,2608.105,2612.943,I didn't remember during the committee that the city has leased a couple of these things in a variety of locations around the city.,21,,
367,0.97,2612.943,2627.491,"My observation of this particular sink indicated that in some respects, it doesn't appear to be Compliant with some of the considerations that Spu shared with the committee last Thursday that have been hurdles to getting the clean hands collective SINKS stood up.",21,,
368,0.97,2627.491,2632.363,Particularly they are very much not A.D.A.,21,,
369,0.97,2632.363,2632.863,Compatible SINKS.,21,,
370,0.97,2632.863,2638.268,You have to pump the water with your foot in order to get the water to come out.,21,,
371,0.97,2638.268,2643.841,Of the sink.,21,,
372,0.97,2643.841,2649.079,"So, for that reason, I am going to send some follow-up questions about what the requisition and Repairman process for those SINKS was.",21,,
373,0.97,2649.079,2663.093,"Why that is different from, if there is a different standard being assessed now than there was when we requisitioned those initial assets.",21,,
374,0.97,2663.093,2675.105,"I'm also interested in a cost differential between the leasing of the honey bucket SINKS versus the clean hands collective SINKS, which appear to be considerably cheaper and more effective investments.",21,,
375,0.97,2675.105,2683.213,"So, I just wanted to let the Council know that I am going to ask that additional question.",21,,
376,0.97,2683.213,2689.153,I would have asked it last Thursday if I had remember that we still had some of these honey bucket SINKS around the city that are currently still being leased.,21,,
377,0.97,2689.153,2695.426,Thank you Marshall falsely for leading me right in front of one to remind me of that.,21,,
378,0.97,2695.426,2711.642,"Moving on, I do want to give a shout out now that the state legislative session is all over, to the Legislature for sending us $2 million to expand tiny houses in the state Capitol budget.",21,,
379,0.97,2711.642,2719.616,This is a great shot in the arm for our efforts here to get more tiny House villages stood up.,21,,
380,0.97,2719.616,2732.162,"$2 million goes a really long way, just to give a reminder to the counselor, the one time capital expenses for tiny House villages range from $400,000- $600,000.",21,,
381,0.97,2732.162,2736.066,"By giving an additional $2 million to cover those capital expenses, is considerable.",21,,
382,0.97,2736.066,2738.268,It can lead to a very big difference.,21,,
383,0.97,2738.268,2759.79,"That money should be available in short order to be merged with pledges of private resources, as well as taxpayer money that is in our budget, and Federal really funny, that is also being discussed in the American recovery act.",21,,
384,0.97,2759.79,2763.894,"More private, safe, four walls with a door that locks shelter options.",21,,
385,0.97,2763.894,2771.969,I want to thank the Speaker for shepherding that proposal through the Legislature and sending us that critical resource.,21,,
386,0.97,2771.969,2781.578,I look forward for us doing everything we can to effectively leverage that resource and stand up more of these critical assets.,21,,
387,0.97,2781.578,2785.716,"With that, Madam President, I don't have any additional updates.",21,,
388,0.97,2785.716,2790.521,Thank you so much Councilmember Lewis.,22,,
389,0.97,2790.521,2794.124,Are there any comments or questions on that report?,22,,
390,0.97,2794.124,2797.528,"Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",22,,
391,0.97,2797.528,2810.04,"Councilmember Lewis, I just wanted to thank you again for continuing to raise this issue and allowing for a very important hearing last week on this and other topics in your Committee.",22,,
392,0.97,2810.04,2822.953,"Unfortunate over the weekend, my whole family got hit by the Norovirus, and the folks haven't experienced that already, I know some of you have, if you haven't experienced that already, it's quite debilitating.",23,,
393,0.97,2822.953,2828.258,You need to wash your hands every single time you go to the bathroom.,23,,
394,0.97,2828.258,2830.661,No matter what that bathroom use is for.,23,,
395,0.97,2830.661,2836.567,Getting the virus is very bad.,23,,
396,0.97,2836.567,2853.05,"I have the luxury of being able to wash my hands every single time over the weekend, and I just continued to think about those who are outside, unable to wash their hands for normal needs in order to prevent the spread of Covid and other diseases.",23,,
397,0.97,2853.05,2862.993,"It was an In-Your-Face example of why we need to have these Handwashingfacilities for everyone, especially for folks who might need outdoors in the element and who need access to Handwashing facilities.",23,,
398,0.97,2862.993,2867.497,Whether it is to prevent the spread of Covid or other diseases.,23,,
399,0.97,2867.497,2872.269,"Thanks again for your continued work on this, and I look forward to learning more from the inquiries that you are sending in.",23,,
400,0.97,2872.269,2874.571,Thank you so much.,24,,
401,0.97,2874.571,2876.473,Any other comments or questions?,24,,
402,0.97,2876.473,2883.013,"Hearing none, we're going to move down the line, next up is Councilmember Herbold, and then Councilmember Juarez.",24,,
403,0.97,2883.013,2884.681,Good morning.,24,,
404,0.97,2884.681,2890.821,"Good morning, thank you so much.",25,,
405,0.97,2890.821,2894.391,There are no items on the full council agenda from the public safety and human services committee.,25,,
406,0.97,2894.391,2904.635,"We will have a public safety and human services committee meeting tomorrow, there are two items on the 9:30 Tuesday, may 11th agenda.",25,,
407,0.97,2904.635,2911.341,The first item is the Seattle police Department budget legislation.,25,,
408,0.97,2911.341,2914.411,Just a quick overview on where we are at on that.,25,,
409,0.97,2914.411,2930.661,"As always, I like to lead the discussion of the Seattle police Department budget with a recognition that the city council fully funded the police Department 2021 hiring plan.",25,,
410,0.97,2930.661,2935.866,"It has always been fully funded, since passage last year.",25,,
411,0.97,2935.866,2945.676,This legislation that is before the Council would not impact the proposed 2021 hiring plan.,25,,
412,0.97,2945.676,2948.945,The legislation is scheduled in committee tomorrow for discussion and possible vote.,25,,
413,0.97,2948.945,2984.281,"As far as sort of the Timeline that has come before, back in March, when we had heard the legislation, the monitor overseeing the Seattle police Department consent decree sent some questions to the police Department and expressed his expectations that the Council not act on the legislation before the monitor received the answers to the questions sent to SPD.",25,,
414,0.97,2984.281,2992.622,"Since that time, the Seattle police Department has responded to the monitor's questions.",25,,
415,0.97,2992.622,2996.893,These are a number of different questions associated with the police Department's budget.,25,,
416,0.97,2996.893,3007.637,"As I've noted on occasion, the committee has delayed additional consideration of the legislation in order to allow for the police Department to reply to the monitor.",25,,
417,0.97,3007.637,3015.345,There has been some uncertainty on whether or not we should expect a response from the monitor.,25,,
418,0.97,3015.345,3031.962,"Based on communication received last week, and have shared with public safety and human services committee members since receiving, that correspondence from the monitor last week.",25,,
419,0.97,3031.962,3061.057,"The monitor's position seems to be that a $2 million budget cut, which is the bill that is before us now, in the context of a $360 million annual budget, and a bill that proposes to lift a $5 million proviso could still somehow put SPD in a position of not being able to deliver key management and operational requirements.",25,,
420,0.97,3061.057,3075.272,"All of the management operational requirements that have been identified are all related to staffing . again, these are--we have fully funded the staffing plan.",25,,
421,0.97,3075.272,3092.923,"So, the current version of the legislation before the committee provides a total of $5.4 million investment to impact of reduced opera singers, including funding community officers.",25,,
422,0.97,3092.923,3096.993,Public information requested positions recommended by the city auditor.,25,,
423,0.97,3096.993,3099.796,And funding for evidence storage as recommended by the inspector general.,25,,
424,0.97,3099.796,3109.606,"Another $225,000 for five civilian crisis Responder positions.",25,,
425,0.97,3109.606,3113.643,It Redirects to million dollars away from the police Department budget toward Participatory budgeting.,25,,
426,0.97,3113.643,3120.15,"Again, makes available an additional $5 million through the release of a proviso.",25,,
427,0.97,3120.15,3122.052,While increasing funding to Participatory budgeting.,25,,
428,0.97,3122.052,3123.22,By $2 million.,25,,
429,0.97,3123.22,3134.764,I have another amendment that has been shared with committee members that the city attorney's office is reviewing.,25,,
430,0.97,3134.764,3141.872,"We'll have a version approved by law, a link to the agenda soon.",25,,
431,0.97,3141.872,3146.176,The amendment proposes to release a second proviso.,25,,
432,0.97,3146.176,3160.59,This proviso is specifically related to the Council's goals to pursue out of order layoffs for officers on the list due to sustained misconduct findings.,25,,
433,0.97,3160.59,3189.019,"A recent legal analysis shows that while the Council was really interested in pursuing out of order layoffs, based on an argument that having officers part of the police Department who can't fully fulfill the obligations of their job, including giving testimony in court, met the legal standards under the public safety civil service rules.",25,,
434,0.97,3189.019,3196.927,For out of order layoffs in instances where doing so would make the Department more efficient.,25,,
435,0.97,3196.927,3219.516,"A recent legal analysis shows that because of this intersection, between our public safety civil service rules and state law, it will be very difficult, if possible at all, to pursue out of order layoffs.",25,,
436,0.97,3219.516,3238.969,"The public safety civil service rules allow out of order layoffs to be Rehired when you move from a place, a moment in time where you are reducing the size of the Department by laying off officers, to when you are, like we are now, we are nowhere in a hiring freeze.",25,,
437,0.97,3238.969,3244.074,It Prioritizes the out of order layoff officers for Rehire.,25,,
438,0.97,3244.074,3250.18,"Secondly, state hall prohibits adverse action based solely on their list inclusion.",25,,
439,0.97,3250.18,3263.793,"I had really hoped to be able to address that second issue in this state legislative session, but the state Legislature did not change this 2018 law during the recent session.",25,,
440,0.97,3263.793,3273.203,"Again, that 2018 law specifically prohibits adverse action to be taken against officers based solely on their list inclusion.",25,,
441,0.97,3273.203,3291.621,"I testify this year at the state Legislature and asked for consideration for the change of this element, but this is not one of the elements of police reform that was successfully pursued this year.",25,,
442,0.97,3291.621,3318.415,"So, given that the monitor continued to raise concerns about training and patrol staffing, this amendment is intended to signal our responsiveness to those concerns . It does remain difficult for me to understand how the monitor is suggesting that funding can solve the police Department's training and patrol staffing challenges, given that again the Council has fully funded the police Department's 2021 staffing plan.",25,,
443,0.97,3318.415,3323.653,"So, the second item that is on the agenda for tomorrow is Council bill 120065.",25,,
444,0.97,3323.653,3343.173,"That is legislation that transfers 911 calls, center positions, and parking enforcement officer positions, from the Seattle police Department to the community safety and communications center.",25,,
445,0.97,3343.173,3357.387,"In the budget that we unanimously passed, council bill 119949 established the new community safety and communications center.",25,,
446,0.97,3357.387,3371.201,This new building is intended to help Reframe how the city Úprovides for community safety and response to expanded duties for Nonuniformed staff.,25,,
447,0.97,3371.201,3386.416,It is really intended to help facilitate the reduction of the police Department's Footprint so that those functions that remain in the police Department can be really focused on a traditional law enforcement mission.,25,,
448,0.97,3386.416,3400.897,Ordnance 12 6233 provides that the CFC C would begin performing the 911 call center and enforcement functions by June 1ST.,25,,
449,0.97,3400.897,3408.204,"Their budget last year, the Council took a different approach than the one the Mayor proposed to have calls transferred to Sdot.",25,,
