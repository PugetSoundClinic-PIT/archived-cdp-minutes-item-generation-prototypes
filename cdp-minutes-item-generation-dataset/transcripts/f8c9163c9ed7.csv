30,0.97,209.275,214.28,I moved to adopt the proposed agenda for today's meeting.,11,,
31,0.97,214.28,216.916,A second?,11,,
32,0.97,216.916,222.922,Thank you.,11,,
33,0.97,222.922,229.128,Thank you Council member Kshama Sawant and Councilmember Herbold.,11,,
34,0.97,229.128,261.361,I moved to add a resolution 31934 titled a resolution supporting the taxation of big business in Seattle to fund housing at essential services urging the Washington state Legislature to oppose any ban on Seattle's ability to raise revenue to big business taxes or other progressive revenue sources and requesting the office to communicate this resolution to Washington state lawmakers and wanted to motivate that if I get a second.,12,,
35,0.97,261.361,261.661,Second.,13,,
36,0.97,261.661,266.532,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,14,,
37,0.97,266.532,304.003,It is to find a major expansion of Greenville affordable housing for working people which has historic momentum . big business and the political elite are terrified at how much support there is for the Amazon tax so it is no surprise facing the prospect of a real Amazon tax big business Andwealthy are trying to maneuver at the state level and get a ban against big business taxes and in return for the big price of a ban on the Amazon tax in Seattle big business would concede to a small tax at the county level.,15,,
38,0.97,304.003,318.718,Our movement strongly discounts big level taxes in addition to an Amazon tax in Seattle to support House bill 2907 in its current form which would guarantee King County the authority to raise taxes.,15,,
39,0.97,318.718,338.938,"We also think even if King County were to use the authority it was still full far short of funding earnings but any kind of ban on big business taxes would be a historic selling out of working people, especially in the state with already the most aggressive tax system in the nation.",15,,
40,0.97,338.938,344.444,In 1981 state politicians bin rent control and here we are 40 years later still suffering and so this is a really serious threat.,15,,
41,0.97,344.444,372.238,Last Wednesday it wants to Olympia to protest and meet with legislators to speak out against the threat of a ban I would needs to be clear that there can only be one reason why the establishment of the Democratic party is so far refusing to publicly oppose Preemption and in the Backroom discussions with Amazon and big business they have accepted this historically aggressive tax on progressive taxes already.,15,,
42,0.97,372.238,397.296,Indeed this is precisely what we gathered over this past weekend when my staff was invited to a meeting of human service providers convened by representative Nicole Macquarie to update us on the status of House bill 2907 and I really appreciated the representative convening this meeting but was my staff and other community members learned was frankly alarming.,15,,
43,0.97,397.296,418.618,Big business interests namely the Chamber of Commerce and the downtown Seattle Association and the hotel lobby and other interests are insisting absolutely insisting on the legislatures including a Preemption clause in any bill that RAISES taxes on big business to find affordable housing and essential services.,15,,
44,0.97,418.618,435.234,"The discussions apparently are focused on how business can insulate itself from the Seattle city Council, our voters, from enacting a big business tax.",15,,
45,0.97,435.234,435.902,This is utterly shameful.,15,,
46,0.97,435.902,448.748,"It is extortion, pure and simple, to dangle the prospect of a small amount of Progressive revenues, which we all know even if passed by King County would be grossly inadequate for our needs, in order to get a ban on any other big business taxes.",15,,
47,0.97,448.748,455.121,"If the bill that gets passed in the state Legislature includes a ban of any geographical reach or of any duration, then it will not be a progressive revenue bill anymore.",15,,
48,0.97,455.121,469.569,It will become the protect Bezos Act and a historic betrayal reminiscent of 2013 when the city limits later gaze Boeing the single largest corporate Handout in U.S.,15,,
49,0.97,469.569,484.45,"History and if the protect Bezos act passes it will be at the doorstep of the Democratic establishment because they have the majority in the house, the Senate, and the governor's mansion.",15,,
50,0.97,484.45,498.764,What is even more alarming is that the legislatures including many who are progressive along with some providers are willing to entertain Preemption that is better for the county to get some amount of the funds we need then to get nothing at all.,15,,
51,0.97,498.764,512.812,After decades of funding human services providers feel that even a small amount of Progressive revenue come even with a ban on any future big business taxes needs to be accepted.,15,,
52,0.97,512.812,564.43,"While I am sympathetic to that feeling, it is our collective responsibility as a movement to point out what a tragic Blender it would be for advocates to settle for a tiny fraction of what we need and relinquish any rights to raise further big business taxes to fully fund their needs, and is our collective responsibility as a movement to fight for what we need for the marginalized need not accept the Crumbs that Billionaires are willing to grant us it is important to recognize that the only reason this got introduced in the first place is because of the growing movement but the other thing we heard from representative Nicole Macri was the future of the bill could be decided at 5:00 tomorrow.",15,,
53,0.97,565.431,585.785,There is discussions happening probably right now on the fate of House bill 2907 and the inclusion of a ban so it is absolutely urgent that the Seattle city council on record by voting on this resolution today stating the city council supports progressive business taxes rather than taxes on working people and it URGES Mayor Durkan to impose Preemption which she has so far refused to do.,15,,
54,0.97,585.785,589.989,"Similarly, most ridges lectures in Olympia have been unwilling to make clear statements.",15,,
55,0.97,589.989,603.402,"Senator Jarwin is the exception opposing the ban along with Tammy Morales, and myself as Co- authors.",15,,
56,0.97,603.402,616.315,If other Democratic legislatures had made equally clear promises opposing Preemption than this resolution would not have been necessary.,15,,
57,0.97,616.315,635.301,Last week our movement was disappointed to see that the city council refused to consider this resolution but we have never had an additional week and given the urgency of the moment I do not see any reason to refuse to include it on the agenda today and also I hope my colleagues understand that timing is of the essence.,15,,
58,0.97,635.301,669.769,"This resolution if passed would be important but it will not be enough and we now have to use every tool at our disposal and make sure that we keep building a movement to oppose the ban and if the Council moves forward and places the resolution on today's agenda and they approve it, this would add to the weight of the letter that we all sign as a council last week initiated by Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda opposing the Preemption and is that we have all said we need to use all the tools in our Toolbox with such a resolution.",15,,
59,0.97,669.769,670.102,Thank you.,15,,
60,0.97,670.102,673.572,"Thank you, Kshama Sawant.",16,,
61,0.97,673.572,677.243,Okay please hold your applause.,16,,
62,0.97,677.243,685.651,So what we have before us was basically Councilmember Kshama Sawant made a motion to amend the agenda.,16,,
63,0.97,685.651,719.418,"Councilmember Herbold moved to second the motion of Councilmember Sawant so what we are voting on a is to add whether to add the resolution of Councilmember Sawant to the agenda we look at to the merits and discussion for other colleagues can weigh in on the resolution itself . with that on the issue of adding the resolution to today's agenda, not the merits just to add to the resolution, other any more comments looks okay.",16,,
64,0.97,719.418,728.427,"Seen in, then those in favor of the amendment that is adding the resolution for today vote aye and raise your hand.",16,,
65,0.97,728.427,732.098,Aye.,17,,
66,0.97,732.098,735.801,Those opposed? okay.,18,,
67,0.97,735.801,751.05,"So what we know now is we have amended the motion which is passed, and the resolution is now on today's agenda, and so with that we will pick that up after we do public comment.",18,,
68,0.97,751.05,760.559,So Jody or Emilia?,18,,
69,0.97,760.559,766.866,"What I would like people to do so I'm not put in a position to have to interrupt you or cut you off, everyone today is going to have one minute.",18,,
70,0.97,766.866,772.972,"I'm going to ask that you line up at microphone one, two, and three.",18,,
71,0.97,772.972,775.975,"Are we calling things out three at a time, Jody?",18,,
72,0.97,775.975,779.645,So we will do four names.,18,,
73,0.97,779.645,799.098,"When you hear your name, all four of you that is microphone one, two, and three so we can move through so you can use your minutes and then we will see where we are at in 20 minutes and if there is still work to go because we have over 30 people signed up.",18,,
74,0.97,799.098,799.698,Close to 40.,18,,
75,0.97,799.698,804.003,We will move to add an additional 20 minutes so with that Jody do you want to call the first names?,18,,
76,0.97,804.003,813.212,"Alex Finch, Sean Butterfield, Vivian camel Rousin, and Barb Oliver.",19,,
77,0.97,813.212,813.712,All right.,20,,
78,0.97,813.712,814.713,Go ahead.,20,,
79,0.97,814.713,818.817,All right.,21,,
80,0.97,818.817,821.12,My name is Alex Finch and I live in North Lake.,21,,
81,0.97,821.12,827.693,Well heard about the Mayor's office Backtracking on the promise to let her stay at the current location until March.,21,,
82,0.97,827.693,837.636,Last Wednesday we were given the two main reasons why.,21,,
83,0.97,837.636,844.443,Úthe executive representative stated that the city will not work with churches to host those camps and the city would never reach an agreement allowing a self empowered encampment to continue operating.,21,,
84,0.97,844.443,857.656,Especially if Nickelsville was involved . It means that Northlake or any encampment cannot exist if they do not surrender their freedoms and submit to authoritarian rule.,21,,
85,0.97,857.656,861.126,If the ordinance passes with that philosophy it would be more meaningless than the promises of a Mayor.,21,,
86,0.97,861.126,871.136,"Thank you, sir.",22,,
87,0.97,871.136,882.581,Just state your name and what you would like to speak to expect he'll.,23,,
88,0.97,882.581,885.017,My name is Sean and I a member of Socialist alternative.,23,,
89,0.97,885.017,887.753,I want to speak to the issue of Preemption in the state ban.,23,,
90,0.97,887.753,903.102,Preemption strikes at the heart of the ability of the city to generate revenue in a progressive manner across Washington this is an outrageous price to pay under consideration in Olympia.,23,,
91,0.97,903.102,906.372,Seattle must defend its right to lead in the defense of other communities across the state.,23,,
92,0.97,906.372,911.877,Housing is not the only need that remains underfunded and we should not sit by while the only opportunity 92 fund spending priorities is negotiated away.,23,,
93,0.97,911.877,926.525,I like to say thank you to the office of Kshama Sawant for pushing this so effectively and please city Council to stand today and send a clear message to Olympia that this is not how we should be doing business in our state.,23,,
94,0.97,926.525,926.892,Thank you.,23,,
95,0.97,926.892,930.629,"Go ahead, Ma'am.",24,,

99,0.97,944.476,967.099,"I am here and I am just horrified at the fact that we are going to be going after all businesses who make 150,000 or more.",25,,
100,0.97,968.033,991.29,It is going for the top 3% which is who we should be going up there which is all big business but the fact that there has to be a quote of 2 million population of a county who have that right that in several years they decide to move into one of the smaller counties we can no longer text them because there is a quote put on there there is no other county that has 2 million.,25,,
101,0.97,991.29,997.996,"The next biggest County which is Pierce only has 800,000.",25,,
102,0.97,997.996,1000.866,I'm going to have to ask you to wrap up.,26,,
103,0.97,1000.866,1005.704,Thank you very much.,27,,
104,0.97,1005.704,1016.315,Please we need the plan of Sawant.,27,,

107,0.97,1025.791,1033.499,I would respectfully ask you is you are looking to add more tiny home villages to think about two things.,28,,
108,0.97,1033.499,1048.414,First of all the number that you need and the quality that you need that we have a system now where we build tiny homes that are mold resistant and we build them faster than any other group in the city.,28,,
109,0.97,1048.414,1059.925,"Aside from that, the real reason that I'm here is to talk bout why tiny homes matter and I will use one story of my time to talk about my friend Sonja.",28,,
110,0.97,1059.925,1071.537,This is the day that Sonja got her tiny homes at can't second chance and six months later she found out she had brain cancer so this is Sonja with her best friend Lily.,28,,
111,0.97,1071.537,1075.874,"These are communities, folks there are more than tiny homes.",28,,
112,0.97,1075.874,1098.764,Homeless list is a lack of community and hear her friend gives her medicine and gives her food and hopes are out and now six months later and six Surgeries later this is what is Sonja looks like in her permanent home . This is why we do this and this is why we need to get more people off the ground.,28,,
113,0.97,1098.764,1099.064,Thank you.,28,,
114,0.97,1099.064,1100.966,Thank you.,29,,

121,0.97,1139.037,1153.318,The most important part about tiny homes is being in the transition of shelter and having nowhere to go during the day and being in the rain and being cold.,32,,
122,0.97,1153.318,1166.565,I just wanted to emphasize tiny homes give people the courage to have an area and to get back out into's start building themselves up again instead of being so down.,32,,
123,0.97,1166.565,1176.174,Thank you so much for pain attention to this matter and if we can get more tiny homes that would be wonderful.,32,,

137,0.97,1238.537,1252.451,I am a member of the tax Amazon movement and I'm here to absorb the massive popular opposition that we have to the statewide ban.,40,,
138,0.97,1252.451,1298.997,"Among legislators in Olympia there is a narrative floating around that we have to accept the addition of this ban so that it can move forward but working people understand that if Hb2907 were to move forward to returning to a protected Jeff Bezos bill and while Preemption has the support of big business it does not have the support of working people are movement and in just the last week our petition and we put Online has gained 2000 signatures and 1078 of those have been Online and 1128 collected just last night at the Bernie Sanders rally . We collected these with only 20 active is there in a crowd of 20,000.",40,,
139,0.97,1298.997,1313.078,"Every person we talked to was eager to sign this and I know we could've collected more that we had a stronger show of force because the 20,000 people who were there cheered when Councilmember Sawant announced the tax Amazon movement.",40,,
140,0.97,1313.078,1314.913,I need you to wrap up.,41,,
141,0.97,1314.913,1321.887,They also Booed . So we need to pass this resolution.,42,,
142,0.97,1321.887,1325.524,You know you are not more special than everyone else.,43,,
143,0.97,1325.524,1325.991,Okay.,43,,
144,0.97,1325.991,1327.426,So we have four other people.,43,,
145,0.97,1327.426,1334.132,Did we Miss this person right here? I think we did.,43,,
146,0.97,1334.132,1334.733,Do we have now?,43,,
147,0.97,1334.733,1346.511,"We are now on Jon Manilla, Jake Britzenhoff, and Ed mass.",44,,
148,0.97,1346.511,1368.3,"Hello . My name is Jon Manilla and him speaking today in support of the resolution of Councilmember Sawant against Preemption . just to speak very plainly, we have a ton of problems in the city and in the county.",45,,

426,0.97,3678.741,3715.678,"I would really urge my colleagues to vote yes on the resolution and one other thing I would mention is as I said earlier most of us on the Council have already signed a letter initiated by Councilmember Mosqueda in which we are taking a clear position against Preemption but we need all tools in the Toolbox, and I dreaded to think of what message it will send the corporate Democrats if this resolution does not get voted through and get a majority Yes vote today I do not know what message it will send.",136,,
427,0.97,3715.678,3724.787,It would be basically that the Seattle city council is not actually standing against Preemption.,136,,
428,0.97,3724.787,3731.728,I think it is historically crucial that we take the correct position and vote yes on the resolution and be consistent with the letter most of us have already signed.,136,,

432,0.97,3740.937,3757.053,I moved to adopt resolution 31934.,138,,

437,0.97,3765.895,3769.966,Councilmember Lewis.,141,,
438,0.97,3769.966,3773.069,Actually have it written down here.,142,,
439,0.97,3773.069,3775.671,It is only February.,143,,
440,0.97,3775.671,3788.384,Thank you so much . So I just wanted to make a couple comments before we formally vote on this.,143,,
441,0.97,3788.384,3802.165,I want to say thank you to Councilmember Sawant for bringing it forward and I totally respect the spirit in which it was introduced and in which we will discuss with you today.,143,,
442,0.97,3802.165,3813.91,I just want to reiterate that in February 10 I was one of the Councilmembers who signed the letter that we did send down to representative Macri and Senator Kaiser expressing four he concerns.,143,,
443,0.97,3813.91,3888.584,The first is the increasing of the revenue because we know it is a good start but it does not go far enough to respond to the scale of our crisis and in excluding the Preemption and making sure we are allocating those funds to essential services and housing in an equitable way and clarifying how much it is going to go to the regional authority and who we sent this letter and since that time have been at the table as a Stakeholder regionally ending discussions on this bill from my conversations with my delegation and my conversations with representative Macri the concerns of this Council are being heard in the halls of Olympia and we are active participants and not passive observers . While I believe in the good intentions behind this resolution I also believe that the framework based in that letter and the follow-up Trainings in the table discussion with the office of Intergovernmental relations on a weekly basis has been the better approach for working out this policy with our friends than this resolution would.,143,,
444,0.97,3888.584,3898.894,I want to be clear that have complete confidence and trust in representative Nicole Macri and that's part of the reason I will be vote no on this resolution today.,143,,
445,0.97,3898.894,3926.088,The sponsor of HB 2907 representative Macri who has managed this process so far with grace and fortitude and is a progressive here is the deputy director for the downtown emergency service center and takes a Backseat to nobody in her commitment to helping our neighbors experiencing homelessness and no local politician can match her experience as a service provider.,143,,
446,0.97,3926.088,3948.878,Her progressive credentials are beyond reproach and my knowing her as a friend and as a colleague her work has admits the rights of people expressing homelessness and her work has save lives and provided respite to people have suffered on our streets expressing homelessness.,143,,
447,0.97,3948.878,3953.949,She is the person in the room on this.,143,,
448,0.97,3953.949,3960.623,I trust her and I have her back and I will continue to engage in making HB 2907 the strongest bill possible.,143,,
449,0.97,3960.623,3963.492,I do not think this resolution will help that cause at this time.,143,,
450,0.97,3963.492,3971.667,Thank you Councilmember Lewis . is there any other comments before I turn over to Councilmember Sawant to make a closing statement?,144,,
451,0.97,3971.667,3972.768,The floor is yours.,144,,
452,0.97,3972.768,3994.156,I appreciate Councilmember Lewis stating what his opinion is although I do not agree with his position but of other Councilmembers plan to vote no I would prefer to hear your opinions and I think you owe the public an explanation of why he will be vote no on the resolution.,145,,
453,0.97,3994.156,4000.763,"I think we're just going to take a vote so like you to have any closing, so that I will do a vote.",146,,
454,0.97,4000.763,4020.716,"So I do not agree with the Othello plan to vote no on this resolution because I do not think that any politician, including myself, has some sort of lifelong hold over any kind of Progressive label.",147,,
455,0.97,4020.716,4029.925,"You get to be called progressive only if you're actually fighting for a progressive agenda, and I would second the person who spoke.",147,,
456,0.97,4029.925,4031.36,I'm sorry didn't remember your name.,147,,
457,0.97,4031.36,4109.405,"But when you said that only somebody, I'm adding some words here but only somebody with either being completely politically naive or Disingenuous would say that we do not actually need to use all tools in our Toolbox and to say that a representative who is the prime sponsor of the bill and has refused to say that she opposes Preemption which is something she needs to say that the person is a progressive here want to clarify this is not about individuals and certainly not about politicians have the greatest respect for every representative at any time and any given day is fighting for Progressive causes and I will work with anybody who is willing to do so but in our conversation with representative Macri in Olympia she said to me you know as a Othello progressive our lives are hard and the people who spoke basically summed it up wishes I do not think progressive politicians can complain because the lives of ordinary people are 1000 times harder, and it is our duty to absolutely be fighting and I have said this before and I will say this again.",147,,
458,0.97,4109.405,4145.441,Is somebody who claims as a progressive and your life is not hard as an elected official and you are doing something wrong and you are failing ordinary people . I do not think that anybody who votes no on this resolution can claim that they are doing everything in their power to prevent what will be a historic betrayal of Seattle and the States working people.,147,,
459,0.97,4145.441,4145.741,Okay.,148,,
460,0.97,4145.741,4163.025,"First of all thank you, Councilmember Sawant, for bring this forward and thank you colleagues for giving Councilmember Sawant the opportunity to amend the agenda and putting this in front of us and thank you Councilmember Lewis for your comments and with that I will take the boat.",148,,
461,0.97,4163.025,4167.329,Those in favor of adopting the resolution please vote aye and raise your hand.,148,,
462,0.97,4167.329,4168.163,Aye.,149,,

465,0.97,4174.47,4178.774,No.,152,,
466,0.97,4178.774,4186.148,The resolution fails 2-5 and that is two thirds.,153,,
467,0.97,4186.148,4186.882,All right.,153,,
468,0.97,4186.882,4201.83,Thank you . will move on with the calendar.,153,,
469,0.97,4205.267,4208.304,No Preemption.,154,,
470,0.97,4208.304,4208.704,Okay.,155,,
471,0.97,4208.704,4213.375,So we are going to move on to the calendar and the next item is the report of the city council.,155,,
472,0.97,4213.375,4214.577,Please read the report.,155,,
473,0.97,4214.577,4230.526,"Agenda item 1 and it is 314445 and the state of the city address delivered by Mayor Jenny Durkan on February 18, 2020.",156,,
474,0.97,4230.526,4234.43,So this is basically what Michael delivered to city hall which was a copy of the Mayor's speech.,157,,
475,0.97,4234.43,4241.937,I moved to file 314445 . is there a second?,157,,
476,0.97,4241.937,4242.338,Second.,158,,
477,0.97,4242.338,4246.242,Thank you we have a second and those in favor of filing vote yes or aye.,159,,
478,0.97,4246.242,4261.59,Aye . The relevant have it and the case is on file.,160,,
479,0.97,4262.925,4268.297,Let's move to the next item which is the second item and it is a little bit different than what we had on the public agenda.,160,,
480,0.97,4268.297,4274.87,The select Committee on homeless strategies investments the report of the Committee on homeless strategies and investments please read the short title.,160,,
481,0.97,4274.87,4291.987,Providing the transitional Encampments for homeless and Visuals are allowed on any property owned or controlled by a religious organization without approval under the Seattle land use code to permit transitional Encampments for homeless individuals as an interim use within the city of Seattle.,161,,
482,0.97,4291.987,4308.704,"I will allow Councilmember Lewis since he came out of his committee and also Councilmember Sawant to kick us off and then I have a few comments to make about the nine amendments that we will have in front of us for discussion so handed to you, Councilmember Lewis.",162,,
483,0.97,4308.704,4309.905,Thank you so much.,163,,
484,0.97,4309.905,4323.485,I will be brief on this so that we can get into the matter and give Councilmember Sawant the opportunity to talk about the bill.,163,,
485,0.97,4323.485,4345.941,I'm grateful to my colleagues on the committee for the great sessions that we had on this leading up to this that we had a really good presentation from folks in the community as well as service providers and folks with learned experience about the need to protect and expand tiny House villages and the scope and scale of the changes.,163,,
486,0.97,4345.941,4366.628,We had a really good session a week ago where we passed an essential amendments admitted forward for the final action today . I just want to say thank you to I want for being diligent with the Timelines and having productive conversations during those meeting and I want to say thank you to Councilmember Sawant for bringing this ordinance forward.,163,,
487,0.97,4366.628,4388.884,"It is a testimony to the strength of the ordinance and the changes that we did an act last week really did not go to changing the core of ordinance and merely made a couple cosmetic changes and clarified a few things that needed clarification we will talk about the additional amendments after this, but I will turn over to Councilmember Sawant.",163,,
488,0.97,4388.884,4390.886,Thank you.,164,,
489,0.97,4390.886,4395.858,Councilmember?,164,,
490,0.97,4395.858,4396.658,Thank you.,165,,
491,0.97,4396.658,4409.705,I want to start by saying thank you to everyone who has advocated not only for this bill but also has been fighting for our homeless neighbors and for housing justice all these years.,165,,
492,0.97,4409.705,4420.783,Many of them preceding my time in Seattle and a special thanks to Nickelsville and the low income housing Institute for spearheading the work that eventually became tiny homes.,165,,
493,0.97,4420.783,4443.338,"As you all know, as I hope you all know, this bill expands options for and removes obstacles to establishing tiny House villages in Seattle but also is relevant to safe parking spaces and other sanctioned homeless Encampments.",165,,
494,0.97,4443.338,4450.412,Tiny villages have been one of the most successful homeless services the been created in our city.,165,,
495,0.97,4450.412,4466.128,"They are decidedly the most humane, the most respectful to our homeless neighbors and have one of the best track records in helping people to find permanent housing.",165,,
496,0.97,4466.128,4498.193,"The self managed model homes homeless people form community and really abandon the isolation of the streets . in the public hearing last fall we heard testimony of homeless people courageously sharing personal stories about how tiny House villages help them get safe, clean and sober, get the dignity, and begin to manage Post-Traumatic stress, help their neighbors, and find housing.",165,,
497,0.97,4498.193,4520.716,The city council should be doing everything in our power to make it easier and not more difficult for people to set up tiny House villages which includes providing every assistance possible to tiny House community providers who work on shoestring budgets and do not need any more obstacles.,165,,
498,0.97,4520.716,4523.919,They need it to be easier for them to do what they are doing.,165,,
499,0.97,4523.919,4545.741,That means removing the red tape that has been associated which this bill will do minus some of the bad amendments that are being proposed and fight for funding to expand ledges and provide them with services like Casement . does not provide the funding for additional tiny home villages.,165,,
500,0.97,4545.741,4578.24,"We will need to fight for that funding in the budget this file . We should not confuse the two things, and we all know that a tiny house is certainly far better than having a tent and we need to support every effort to replace tens a tiny House but I do not agree with making that a condition to get a permit because putting that obstacle in the way does not help anyone to go from a tent to a tiny house.",165,,
501,0.97,4578.24,4589.851,It only makes it harder because what homeless service writer will put up a tiny house and Unsanctioned income from it.,165,,
502,0.97,4589.851,4611.573,"Needs to make sure that we remove the obstacles this addresses the Land-Use laws that create restrictions on tiny House villages . They have proven beyond any doubt the effectiveness, and I do not think that any Council Councilmember who adds more obstacle in the past can claim to be serious about addressing the homelessness crisis.",165,,
503,0.97,4611.573,4630.258,I urge Othello oppose amendments that would constrain opportunity to establish tiny House villages . a subject bill that is a technical amendment corrects the numbering of the amendments and the date of the signature line and so on and so forth.,165,,
504,0.97,4630.258,4646.908,The second amendment but I am bringing forward with grandfather in the existing Encampments and I will talk more about that but other amounts that would actually not help this bill and I appreciate people speaking in public testimony about the.,165,,
505,0.97,4646.908,4660.455,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant I believe we have nine proposed amendments and I will: teach Councilmember in the proposed order as outlined on the table.",166,,
506,0.97,4660.455,4666.762,"At that time the sponsor will have the opportunity to move there amendment and I'm hoping somebody will second there amendment, or I will.",166,,
507,0.97,4666.762,4670.465,Let me just share this as follows.,166,,
508,0.97,4670.465,4677.172,We actually have it lined up.,166,,
509,0.97,4677.172,4689.651,"I will just list the Councilmember and what amendment numbers they are, and then we will start the way it is listed in the following order we will start with this.",166,,
510,0.97,4689.651,4695.19,"Councilmember Pedersen has amendment number one, seven, and nine New York Councilmember Sawant has two and four.",166,,
511,0.97,4695.19,4709.771,"Councilmember Mosqueda has three and I understand that Councilmember Lewis will be presenting the amendment of Councilmember Mosqueda and then Councilmember Lewis has five, six, and eight.",166,,
512,0.97,4709.771,4712.908,"With that, we will start with amendment number one from Councilmember Pedersen.",166,,
513,0.97,4712.908,4752.414,"Thank you . The purpose of this substitute one of the reasons that we are here is because the current ordinance is expiring so this substitute would extend for two more years and the idea is to honor the regional homelessness authority that we just established because that authority will be coming back to us with a Five- year plan informed by experts on this issue, including people with lived experience that we set that up so that we could have a regional response to this regional crisis.",167,,
514,0.97,4752.414,4784.88,"This would extend the current law by two years . It would also allow greater flexibility with the one-year extension on interim loose encampment permits and also increase the number of interim use encampment from three, which is the correct number under the current law, up to 15 is just a reminder to the public there is no limit on the accessory permits.",167,,
515,0.97,4784.88,4793.321,This is best for them use but again it is increasing it from three up to 15.,167,,
516,0.97,4793.321,4806.101,Realistically there are several that would convert to an interim use.,167,,
517,0.97,4806.101,4818.18,This is still adding a greater number . I got feedback from that other committee of the whole last week to look for a larger number.,167,,
518,0.97,4818.18,4818.98,Going up to 15.,167,,
519,0.97,4818.98,4829.591,"This is meant to extend the current law, allow greater flexibility with the one-year extension, and go from three up to 15.",167,,
520,0.97,4829.591,4829.991,Thank you.,167,,
521,0.97,4829.991,4833.228,Councilmember Pedersen did you move to amend?,168,,
522,0.97,4833.228,4841.536,My motion is to have the substitute bill with those three parameters.,169,,
523,0.97,4841.536,4842.137,I'm sorry.,170,,
524,0.97,4842.137,4842.737,Is there a second?,170,,
525,0.97,4842.737,4843.738,I will second.,171,,
526,0.97,4843.738,4844.239,Okay.,172,,
527,0.97,4844.239,4880.642,A second by Councilmember Herbold rather any comments on the substitution? But I just want to speak appreciation to Councilmember Pedersen in hearing some of the feedback that he heard last week about the fact that the sunset Encampments are likely to roll over to be used this authority and the number of proposed last week would essentially take up the new authority.,172,,
528,0.97,4880.642,4900.061,"Cary grant that I think number 15 is still to go low and does not allow for enough growth because as we have learned, safe parking projects also count as transitional Encampments and they will count against this total.",172,,
529,0.97,4900.061,4913.275,We all received a really welcome update from the human services Department director acting director Johnson about safe parking lot location.,172,,
530,0.97,4913.275,4950.245,Some of them are hosted by religious institutions but some of them are not . I would hate to just take this action today and not realize any ability for significant growth to meet the need particularly the need for moving people directly from the streets into safe shelter with a door and with a sense of community and with a key . The things that are making this intervention so successful in realizing outcomes.,172,,
531,0.97,4950.245,4955.717,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold . Councilmember Sawant?",173,,
532,0.97,4955.717,4956.718,I apologize.,174,,
533,0.97,4956.718,4959.054,Thank you.,174,,
534,0.97,4959.054,4986.648,"I just want to be clear with members of the public that this is not really, I do not consider this a substitute bill this is really a no vote disguised as subject and since Councilmember Pedersen opposes expanding opportunities to build tiny House lodges I would prefer if he was honest about it vote no rather than attempting to tell the public a story that is not actually accurate.",174,,
535,0.97,4986.648,5005.4,Just to give you an example he just give you an impression that he is increasing the number of sentient tiny House villages up to 15 but really what his sister would do is take away what is in my original bill which is 40 and then reduce it to 15.,174,,
536,0.97,5005.4,5062.157,"Is a Sleight-Of-Hand that he is engaging in . In reality, this amendment if this passes it would actually be really bad for the whole objective that we are trying to achieve here which is that the tiny home project has been so successful with so many evaluations and compare it to the homeless people that every year and has not been effective in any way whatsoever and here is a program that very Hard-Working nonprofit providers overturn which is actually providing service and the best assessment of this is from homeless people themselves who will tell you that this is the only thing that has actually helped them to get their lives together.",174,,
537,0.97,5062.157,5098.493,"If this passes it would be really bad for the underlying bill because it would take away many Progressive measures such as streamlining the permit process for temporary Encampments, making tiny house is available in different zones, increasing the number of permit tiny homes, and it would create another sunset clause expiring in two years which would mean that we would have to go through another seven month period to extend the permit if you look at the timing it would mean we would have to start the process to extend it again.",174,,
538,0.97,5098.493,5137.632,I would just say in closing when my office put forward resolutions taking a stand against the war with Iraq and religious persecution in India issues that matter Councilmember Pedersen said that was a waste of the time of the Council we should be focused on addressing the homelessness crisis but now I brought forward a bill that would address the homelessness crisis and we have the Councilmember opposing it and attempting to undermine it so I will oppose this amendment and urge the public to be aware of what is going on.,174,,
539,0.97,5137.632,5138.833,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant . Okay.",175,,
540,0.97,5138.833,5140.301,Let's go forward with a vote.,175,,
541,0.97,5140.301,5141.336,Point of order.,176,,
542,0.97,5141.336,5143.338,"08, Councilmember Herbold.",177,,
543,0.97,5143.338,5175.17,I just want to speak to our comments as individual Councilmembers and as a body in Impugning the motives of our callings . There was another proposal before the committee last week by Councilmember Lewis that was for 20 and so I believe that Councilmember Pedersen has brought this forth in good faith and nobody accused Councilmember Lewis last week of acting in bad faith.,178,,
544,0.97,5175.17,5183.545,I believe Councilmember Pedersen heard my concerns and tried to bring forward a proposal but I would just like for us to show a little grace for one another appear.,178,,
545,0.97,5183.545,5197.292,I am going to let Councilmember respond briefly and that will go to a boat.,179,,
546,0.97,5200.061,5201.062,"Still ahead, House bill 2907.",179,,
547,0.97,5201.062,5206.701,My colleague Councilmember Herbold is free to have whatever opinion she has but I am also an elected representative elected by the voters of my district.,180,,
548,0.97,5206.701,5219.414,My loyalty is to ordinary people and not an elected official and I do not believe that this kind of substitute is directed with good intentions and it is not a question of intentions.,180,,
549,0.97,5219.414,5224.819,It is a question of what effect this would have and I am primarily focused on the affected would have and that is not debatable.,180,,
550,0.97,5224.819,5225.22,Okay.,181,,
551,0.97,5225.22,5225.52,Thank you.,181,,
552,0.97,5225.52,5229.424,We have nine amendments in front of us and so I'm going to ask that you withhold your clapping.,181,,
553,0.97,5229.424,5243.671,This isn't a rally I will agree and second what Councilmember Herbold said about Impugning other people's intentions . I think we are all here trying to do the right thing in a good way.,181,,
554,0.97,5243.671,5245.54,With that I'm going to move forward with our vote.,181,,
555,0.97,5245.54,5248.81,Those in favor of the amendment and so decision raise your hand and vote aye.,181,,
556,0.97,5248.81,5249.744,Aye.,182,,
557,0.97,5249.744,5250.912,Those opposed?,183,,
558,0.97,5250.912,5259.654,No.,184,,
559,0.97,5259.654,5265.059,You know at times like this I like the public to know that most of the time 95% we are in agreement.,185,,
560,0.97,5265.059,5270.064,It is just how we get there.,185,,
561,0.97,5270.064,5270.665,All right.,185,,
562,0.97,5270.665,5271.933,Let's go on to the next one.,185,,
563,0.97,5271.933,5283.945,The next is amendment 2 which is Councilmember Sawant which is a substitution and Councilmember Sawant do you want to go ahead and present it?,185,,
564,0.97,5283.945,5284.178,Yes.,186,,
565,0.97,5284.178,5317.011,This substitute bill is a technical amendment correcting numbering after the amendments that were made in the committee updating the date on the signature line to 2019 and correcting the language around the amendment of Councilmember Herbold for a geographic spread . that correction with the agreement of Councilmember Herbold makes the language match how the amendment was verbally described at the table because the original language of the amendment was not the way that she intended and so we worked it out.,186,,
566,0.97,5317.011,5318.78,I moved amendment 2.,186,,
567,0.97,5318.78,5319.213,Second.,187,,
568,0.97,5319.213,5320.815,Thank you.,188,,
569,0.97,5320.815,5333.428,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen for providing the center to the amendment of Councilmember Sawant.,188,,
570,0.97,5333.428,5335.396,Are there any other comments before we moved to a vote?,188,,
571,0.97,5335.396,5338.833,Those in favor of the substitution of Councilmember Sawant about aye and raise your hand.,188,,
572,0.97,5338.833,5341.502,Aye.,189,,
573,0.97,5341.502,5342.503,Those opposed say no.,190,,
574,0.97,5342.503,5347.542,The ayes have it and it is adopted.,191,,
575,0.97,5347.542,5356.951,Let's go to amendment three and this is Councilmember Mosqueda but I understand Councilmember Lewis will be presenting . please take the floor and make the motion.,191,,
576,0.97,5356.951,5357.552,Thank you.,192,,
577,0.97,5357.552,5396.124,That is correct and in the absence of Councilmember Mosqueda I will be moving this amendment which modifies a recital in the proposed ordinance to reflect the appropriation subject to a proviso in the 2020 budget for homelessness could be expanded on tiny House villages and then it references the Council budget actions 3B3 to just a technical change the recital and I move that we so amend the Council bill.,192,,
578,0.97,5396.124,5397.358,Could we have a second?,193,,
579,0.97,5397.358,5398.259,Second.,194,,
580,0.97,5398.259,5409.036,We have a second and so it has been moved to amend the bill.,195,,
581,0.97,5409.036,5410.204,Are there any other comments?,195,,
582,0.97,5410.204,5410.438,Okay.,195,,
583,0.97,5410.438,5411.272,Let's go to a boat.,195,,
584,0.97,5411.272,5426.02,Those in favor of Councilmember Mosqueda is presented by Councilmember Lewis amendment and those in favor vote aye and raise your hand and the motion carries and is adopted.,195,,
585,0.97,5426.02,5431.025,"Let's move on to amendment 4 on the floor is yours, Councilmember Sawant.",195,,
586,0.97,5431.025,5436.23,Yes . I do not expect this amendment to be controversial.,196,,
587,0.97,5436.23,5471.666,It would grandfather in the existing Encampments from the setback requirements created in the committee meeting practically speaking this would only impact one encampment and the structures three feet inside the neighbors are supportive of the encampment and would be inefficient and unnecessary to move in number of the structures by three feet and they renew their permanent and there'll be no other impact to this amendment so I assume should be dead and I need to move.,196,,
588,0.97,5471.666,5473.067,Second.,197,,
589,0.97,5473.067,5479.841,Other any other comments for Councilmember Lewis?,198,,
590,0.97,5479.841,5491.886,Just briefly I want to state that this is a particular personal amendment to me given that it does impact the Interbay tiny House village in district 7 which I am particular product.,199,,
591,0.97,5491.886,5511.138,I think there are great neighbors in district 7. I just live up the hill . The idea that we would pass something and when accidentally not incorporate them as something that would affect me if I found out about it later so I appreciate that this was caught intend to corporate.,199,,
592,0.97,5511.138,5535.93,I had the opportunity earlier today at the state of the city address to talk to a few commissioners again and Commissioner Steinberg did come and it really is a great example of Intergovernmental cooperation and I support this amendment and the work that is being done.,199,,
593,0.97,5535.93,5540.635,Thank you.,200,,
594,0.97,5540.635,5556.217,Those in favor of the amendment is your hand and vote aye the motion carries and the amendment is adopted . Let's move on to amendment 5.,200,,
595,0.97,5556.217,5558.92,Councilmember Lewis?,200,,
596,0.97,5558.92,5559.854,Yes.,201,,
597,0.97,5559.854,5562.657,Thank you.,201,,
598,0.97,5562.657,5577.672,This amendment is part of our discussion as the committee last week where we were discussing the requirements for case management and the security of the encampment sites.,201,,
599,0.97,5577.672,5580.641,A previously proposed an amendment.,201,,
600,0.97,5580.641,5634.829,The language and wording of that amendment had perhaps and practice what I went too prescriptive and could've impacted the current practices and that was something I was concerned about so I pulled back that amendment . having consulted with service providers and central staff it is my belief that this amendment more appropriately fits the kind of current standard use when they are talking to providers to provide case management and security in accordance with an approved plan allowing for the flexibility to accommodate unique circumstances and so based on that I move that we incorporate that amendment and that language into the Council bill.,201,,
601,0.97,5634.829,5638.332,Just a little Sidebar here.,202,,
602,0.97,5638.332,5641.135,Did someone second it?,202,,
603,0.97,5641.135,5648.743,I might be doing this too soon but I have a proposed amendment to this amendment.,203,,
604,0.97,5648.743,5651.946,Is the storage time?,203,,
605,0.97,5651.946,5663.057,It was not distributed before 12:00 noon today so I'm requesting that the rules be suspended to allow consideration of the amendment that did not meet the Council rule.,203,,
606,0.97,5663.057,5670.664,I apologize . I did not know that you are going to come forward with so my apologies.,204,,
607,0.97,5670.664,5675.469,This is actually your amendment to Councilmember Lewis amendment correct?,204,,
608,0.97,5675.469,5682.676,Yes.,205,,
609,0.97,5682.676,5684.145,Are you passing it out?,205,,
610,0.97,5684.145,5693.888,I can pass it out here.,205,,
611,0.97,5693.888,5706.4,I move to suspend the Council rules to a consideration of Councilmember Morales is amendment to Councilmember Lewis amendment number but . There it is.,206,,
612,0.97,5706.4,5707.568,I see it.,206,,
613,0.97,5707.568,5710.905,Second.,207,,
614,0.97,5710.905,5714.408,"We have it Seconded and go ahead, Councilmember Morales.",208,,
615,0.97,5714.408,5720.715,I have it as amendment one.,209,,
616,0.97,5720.715,5727.822,We need to now move to suspend the rule.,210,,
617,0.97,5727.822,5731.125,I need to now vote on suspending to allow consideration of the amendment.,211,,
618,0.97,5731.125,5732.393,Okay.,211,,
619,0.97,5732.393,5742.236,All those in favor of Councilmember Morales introducing an amendment to Councilmember Lewis vote aye.,211,,
620,0.97,5742.236,5745.739,Aye . before his ears.,212,,
621,0.97,5745.739,5749.41,Thank you . My apologies.,213,,
622,0.97,5749.41,5798.893,Especially after complaining last week about everybody bringing amendments at the last minute I appreciate your indulgence . I moved to amend the amendment as presented on the document revising section D.1.2 by deleting and security after provide case management and the reason that I'm doing this is because I do think that Te security requirement can pose additional barrier and cost to beginning new communities but also I believe that we should not codify the security requirement when there are different circumstances for different kinds of Encampments.,213,,
623,0.97,5798.893,5805.466,The security can be determined based on the circumstance and really managed during the contracting process.,213,,
624,0.97,5805.466,5810.771,So that is the rationale for removing it for this amendment.,213,,
625,0.97,5810.771,5814.909,Removing that language.,213,,
626,0.97,5814.909,5818.679,Thank you.,214,,
627,0.97,5818.679,5837.498,I do appreciate Councilmember Morales bringing forward this amendment to the amendment because I do think that this is an important thing to discuss and talk about appreciate the spirit in which this has been introduced.,214,,
628,0.97,5837.498,5933.227,I do think it is important that regardless of what we do today as a Council the security requirement that has enumerated is in existence so regardless of whatever action is and Councilmember Morales did acknowledge that that requirement does exist and there does need to be an approved security plan . from my conversations with service providers one of the things that has been the most inspiring is looking a lot of the Governance systems that exist and how effective they are coming together as a community empowering folks to help manage the camps including providing the security and a lot of the programs improved are significantly participated and even peer run and this allows more flexibility for that in a way that the amendment last week might not have and the second consideration which is important is that her husband a considerable amount of press and the public scrutiny regarding the ordinance . I think one of the criticisms that is often mistakenly levied in the public press against the tiny House village is there is no allotment for security or collaboration with neighborhood groups which we all know is false.,214,,
629,0.97,5933.227,5956.216,I think it helps to enhance this ordinance as a public facing wall to be able to go to the public and say this is currently the rule and for good measure we have also enumerated it and spelled it out in the final ordinance . I do think it is important that we acknowledge that is a requirement.,214,,
630,0.97,5956.216,5960.954,It is pure driven and cognizant of the specific needs.,214,,
631,0.97,5960.954,5966.193,I will be voting against the amendment of Councilmember Morales.,214,,
632,0.97,5966.193,5976.17,"Before we go I need a second for the amendment of Councilmember Morales to number five . Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",215,,
633,0.97,5976.17,5978.172,Is there any more comments?,215,,
634,0.97,5978.172,5987.781,I want to speak to both the amended version of the amendment and the original.,216,,
635,0.97,5987.781,5989.984,I see how it is.,217,,
636,0.97,5989.984,5990.451,Go ahead.,217,,
637,0.97,5990.451,6006.367,"I will be voting yes to the amendment, but I will be voting no whatever the final result in amendment is whether it is an amended version or.",218,,
638,0.97,6006.367,6072.666,"That my comment will explain both . practically speaking with her version of the amendment whether it includes just case management and management and security I do not think it changes much because it is already a condition of receiving funding and because of out if abstaining for an option that would have but we have to vote yes or no so given that, I will be voting yes on the amended version of Councilmember Morales because it mitigates it but vote no on the final amendment because if there was ever a scenario where the clause could result in a tiny House village failing to receive a permit that I think that would be a bad outcome even though those conditions are contained in the requirements to receive a permit but in the spirit in which I have brought this bill forward was to remove obstacles and not put them back in place.",218,,
639,0.97,6072.666,6085.245,In the spirit I would vote no on the final amendment because it is largely academic in this case because these Encampments already have these requirements.,218,,
640,0.97,6085.245,6086.48,Thank you.,219,,
641,0.97,6086.48,6101.662,What we are going to do is and has been Seconded and we will vote on the motion of Councilmember Morales to amend Councilmember Lewis amended number five first so those all in favor of the motion vote aye and raise your hand.,220,,
642,0.97,6101.662,6105.499,Aye.,221,,
643,0.97,6105.499,6105.899,Okay.,222,,
644,0.97,6105.899,6106.7,Those opposed?,222,,
645,0.97,6106.7,6108.302,No.,223,,
646,0.97,6108.302,6122.082,"It fails . Thank you, Councilmember Morales, for provide enough respite we will go on and now we will vote on the base legislation which is amendment five.",224,,
647,0.97,6122.082,6135.629,All those in favor of amendment five as presented vote yes and raise your hand . If you want to vote yes.,224,,
648,0.97,6135.629,6138.098,Yes.,225,,
649,0.97,6138.098,6138.499,Okay.,226,,
650,0.97,6138.499,6140.901,All those opposed?,226,,
651,0.97,6140.901,6142.903,It passes . all right.,226,,
652,0.97,6142.903,6150.911,Let's go to amendment number six which is Councilmember Lewis again.,226,,
653,0.97,6150.911,6158.452,This amendment and I spun this off from amendment five.,227,,
654,0.97,6158.452,6159.419,It used to be combined.,227,,
655,0.97,6159.419,6188.248,The reason for that is currently it is theoretically possible although it has not happened yet that a service provider not receive funding but still open a village and so this amendment would require the encampment operators who are not funded by Hsd still provide case management and security in accordance with the old home standards established in the Seattle King County continuing care.,227,,
656,0.97,6188.248,6211.905,So this just gives some guidance to providers who might want to go ahead and get a permit without Hsd funding how they would get security in case management requirements meant.,227,,
657,0.97,6211.905,6216.51,But I separated it from the other minute because it is sort of a distinct category of potential tiny House village operators.,227,,
658,0.97,6216.51,6218.912,And they do move that it be adopted.,227,,
659,0.97,6218.912,6219.513,Second.,228,,
660,0.97,6219.513,6220.48,Thank you.,229,,
661,0.97,6220.48,6223.417,Any other discussion?,229,,
662,0.97,6223.417,6224.017,Councilmember Herbold.,229,,
663,0.97,6224.017,6270.964,Thank you . I just want to honor the many years maybe decades at this point of transitional Encampments that have functioned without city funding and recognize that obligations such as case management for a more Do-It- yourself approach of taking shelter and providing companionship and safety in numbers that has been able to do so for years and has gotten us to this point that we are talking about expanding sanctioned Encampments.,230,,
664,0.97,6270.964,6286.279,I do not think it is fair to have requirements on the sponsors of transitional Encampments that do not receive city funding.,230,,
665,0.97,6286.279,6288.982,I do feel it is absolutely responsible for acquiring it.,230,,
666,0.97,6288.982,6294.888,For that reason I will not be supporting this amendment.,230,,
667,0.97,6294.888,6301.795,So we have a motion and we have had a second and was moved to a vote.,231,,
668,0.97,6301.795,6331.692,"I do agree with the points of Councilmember Herbold that were just made and just to clarify unlike the previous amendment that was put forward it could really result in tiny House village is failing to get a permit, like the previous case where there is a potential but not really because those requirements already in place.",232,,
669,0.97,6331.692,6339.7,We know it starts as a self organized homeless people forming a village like a community and then they request a permit and start to replace tents with tiny homes and getting case management services.,232,,
670,0.97,6339.7,6368.729,If we want to be connected to the real world that is when the process through which this has happened and many people have worked on this hard for many years if not decades on these issues and so I think we have to make it clear that we don't want to increase this I will be voting no against this.,232,,
671,0.97,6368.929,6369.763,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",233,,
672,0.97,6369.763,6370.731,Let's move to a vote.,233,,
673,0.97,6370.731,6373.367,Those in favor of an amendment about aye and raise your hand.,233,,
674,0.97,6373.367,6374.368,Those opposed vote no.,233,,
675,0.97,6374.368,6375.035,It fails.,234,,
676,0.97,6375.035,6382.175,Let's move on to amendment seven which is Councilmember Pedersen.,234,,
677,0.97,6382.175,6382.776,Thank you.,235,,
678,0.97,6382.776,6415.175,The purpose of this amendment would be to Memorialize the benefits of tiny home villages and that they are providing a physical structure and providing a roof . This legislation was called a tiny home village but now it is just expanding the number of Encampments and not providing the structure what we know about tiny home villages.,235,,
679,0.97,6415.175,6438.298,We know that tiny home villages have had a shaky start in the outcomes we were seeking . tiny home villages made substantial strides and I appreciate the amendment of my colleagues to add case management.,235,,
680,0.97,6438.298,6458.718,This amendment to the physical structure would have required a case management as well as security so the second part of this amendment is consistent with what just passed.,235,,
681,0.97,6458.718,6485.846,What I would like to do is there was some discussion during committee about vehicles and making sure we were including vehicles in this . I am open to removing the last sentence or the part that talks about sleeping areas shall not include recreational vehicles which may include other Owner- occupied vehicles.,235,,
682,0.97,6485.846,6500.293,"Happy to accept friendly amendment to that but again the purpose of this is to provide the structure, the case management, and the security.",235,,
683,0.97,6500.293,6506.199,"Thankfully, we just amended it to provide case management and security leaving us with providing that structure that we know that we see when we visit tiny home villages.",235,,
684,0.97,6506.199,6507.033,We see the structure.,235,,
685,0.97,6507.033,6510.103,"That is the attraction to have the roof, the four walls, and the door.",235,,
686,0.97,6510.103,6511.304,That is what this would do.,235,,
687,0.97,6511.304,6522.515,"Councilmember Pedersen for clarification, is someone proposing a from the amendment to strike the language you are suggesting or are we just moving forward?",236,,
688,0.97,6522.515,6522.716,Okay.,236,,
689,0.97,6522.716,6530.49,Is there any other comment?,236,,
690,0.97,6530.49,6534.528,I would like to move this amendment number seven.,237,,
691,0.97,6534.528,6537.097,Is there a second?,238,,
692,0.97,6537.097,6537.297,Okay.,238,,
693,0.97,6537.297,6546.907,So the motion fails for lack of a second.,238,,
694,0.97,6546.907,6553.146,Let's move to amendment number eight and that would be Councilmember Lewis.,238,,
695,0.97,6553.146,6554.147,Thank you.,239,,
696,0.97,6554.147,6564.658,Amendment eight is a pretty technical change.,239,,
697,0.97,6564.658,6605.065,It occurred to central staff that there were some modular developments or modular Encampments that perhaps would not fit in to the definition that we had previously established . specifically there is a modular Department coming Online in the Soto that the chief Sierra Club will be the operator for that uses these kinds of structures that are secure and good spaces . This just closes that to make sure structures like that are included in counseling that could get a permit so I move that we incorporate that into the definition and move that this amendment be adopted.,239,,
698,0.97,6605.065,6609.302,Thank you.,240,,
699,0.97,6609.302,6617.41,Can I ask a question?,241,,
700,0.97,6617.41,6626.619,So the legislation will not preclude this kind of housing from being used in different context.,241,,
701,0.97,6626.619,6631.424,"Good question, Councilmember Morales.",242,,
702,0.97,6631.424,6646.906,All this would do is add modular structures to our current definition of structures that can be included.,242,,
703,0.97,6646.906,6656.316,And it is strictly talking about this permit authority and not talking about other types of arrangements.,242,,
704,0.97,6656.316,6661.755,It has been Seconded.,243,,
705,0.97,6661.755,6663.823,We have a second there.,244,,
706,0.97,6663.823,6670.663,So with that we haven't moved and second so let's go to a vote.,244,,
707,0.97,6670.663,6676.069,Those in favor of the amendment about aye and raise your hand.,244,,
708,0.97,6676.069,6676.469,Aye.,245,,
709,0.97,6676.469,6678.471,Those opposed vote no.,246,,
710,0.97,6678.471,6688.081,The ayes has eight and amendment eight passes . Let's go to amendment number nine.,247,,
711,0.97,6688.081,6689.549,Councilmember Pedersen?,247,,
712,0.97,6689.549,6696.156,Thank you . This would extend the sunset date by three years.,248,,
713,0.97,6696.156,6706.433,So right now unless we pass what we are aiming to pass today it with sunset next month and this would extended three years.,248,,
714,0.97,6706.433,6726.886,The rationale here is that we made some amendments to strengthen the proposal by adding case management for example . I am dismayed that we haven't actually created a tiny home village structure that this is really a tent encampment instead of tiny home villages.,248,,
715,0.97,6726.886,6730.89,As originally advertised.,248,,
716,0.97,6730.89,6755.448,Because we pass the regional authority it is important that we allow those experts to come back to us with their five-year plan and strategies to reduce homelessness that we Revisit this in three years and it is plenty of time to get back to us with the recommendations and five-year plan.,248,,
717,0.97,6755.448,6759.552,This is amendment nine.,248,,
718,0.97,6759.552,6760.954,Is there a second?,249,,
719,0.97,6760.954,6762.822,Second.,250,,
720,0.97,6762.822,6763.456,Any other comments?,251,,
721,0.97,6763.456,6765.058,Councilmember Herbold.,251,,
722,0.97,6765.058,6799.092,I just want to say that I believe that the legislation before us is zoning and Permanency and legislation and it is not legislation that will be impacted by future decisions of the regional homelessness authority and decisions about how to support tiny home villages and transitional Encampments with our budget might be impacted by those discussions in the future but none zoning legislation like what we have before us.,252,,
723,0.97,6799.092,6801.261,Councilmember Strauss?,253,,
724,0.97,6801.261,6808.668,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen for bringing all of these amendments forward and to all my colleagues.,254,,
725,0.97,6808.668,6817.911,I do want to remind the body that this is a technical bill regarding our land use code.,254,,
726,0.97,6817.911,6862.155,All of these tiny home villages have a two-step process that they must go through to be stood up and that includes funding and that includes a permit process so there is an additional regulatory process that every tiny home village would have or interim cabinet or any of these programs that we have discussed to go forward and that it is in her best interest to align ourselves with the analysis that is already occurred to not support this amendment and teased the maximum capacity that we have and to move people forward as the procedural bill that it is.,254,,
727,0.97,6862.155,6863.156,So your vote no?,255,,
728,0.97,6863.156,6864.324,But that is correct.,255,,
729,0.97,6864.324,6867.126,And it is because you believe it would be a duplicate?,256,,
730,0.97,6867.126,6874.868,This is in accordance with the analysis that was done even before the new Council came.,257,,

733,0.97,6880.673,6922.916,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss . When there is a determination about Sepa that is important for us to get that input but it is not from a decision on whether to proceed with the particular proposal and again this amendment would give us three years of runway to allow this ordinance to take root and blossom and then to take the input from the regional homelessness authority, which wil be coming to us with a five-year plan that will include the Evidence-Based strategies.",259,,
734,0.97,6922.916,6935.161,"All right . We have a motion in front of us, and it has been second and that we will move to a vote . will go ahead, Councilmember Sawant.",260,,

736,0.97,6953.646,6960.753,In this exercise here they also say this is a hard exercise.,261,,
737,0.97,6960.753,6966.225,Imagine if big business was treated that way.,261,,
738,0.97,6966.225,6982.875,Imagine developers were told they could get a permit until 2023 pages think about all of the homeless service providers to jump through to provide the services for the most vulnerable neighbors.,261,,

746,0.97,7042.301,7043.736,"Councilmember Sawant, you have the floor.",267,,
747,0.97,7043.736,7059.919,Think you . So I just wanted to start by saying there is no reason why a city like Seattle it is one of the wealthiest cities in the history of humanity.,268,,
748,0.97,7059.919,7066.059,"Why a city like Seattle should be home to any homelessness, let alone the amount of homelessness that we see.",268,,
749,0.97,7066.059,7109.602,"This is a city that is home to so many millionaires and even Billionaires and still we have not succeeded in ending homelessness and the event creates a pipeline into new homelessness and to be sure even after the passage of this bill, which I hope it passes, we will need to tax big business to fund a massive expansion in investment in social housing we will need rent control and we will need to shore up Renters rights are and make sure that middle-class Proerty owners and working people and small business owners are not facing the brunt of the funding of addressing the crisis.",268,,
750,0.97,7109.602,7122.515,Today this will be an important victory for our movement to stand with our homeless neighbors and to make sure that we take steps toward making this a humane city.,268,,
751,0.97,7122.515,7133.793,Tiny houses another replacement for actual heat housing But while homelessness exists there is no reason why people should be left on the streets.,268,,
752,0.97,7133.793,7160.72,"There should be a tiny House available for anyone who is nowhere better to go to Walnut an alternative to affordable housing, it is a powerful way to make homelessness less harmful and has been proven to help homeless people get back on their feet . passing this legislation will be a real triumph for homeless advocates who have fought to establish the first encampment in the tiny House villages.",268,,
753,0.97,7160.72,7173.533,It is really important to remember the history of the struggle because homeless people and advocates and House neighbors have to fight for it and they have to be United to fight for it.,268,,
754,0.97,7173.533,7182.275,Camp second chance was first to be created when activists stopped access to the unused parcel and set up on encampment.,268,,
755,0.97,7182.275,7192.084,Is important to remember this history . They were threatened with a sweep and we have to organize to stop the Mayor from kicking them out at that early stage.,268,,
756,0.97,7192.084,7199.659,Similarly Nickelsville has occupied statement to set up and commence until they wanted permits.,268,,
757,0.97,7199.659,7210.703,Over the last year Georgetown and the Northlake tiny House villages have been threatened with losing their permit and Northlake is currently under threat.,268,,
758,0.97,7210.703,7230.523,Our budget movement won the first funding in 2014 and in terms of remember and I want to say thank you to the Councilmembers at the time who worked in the office at the time to help when that planning and increases of subsequent years.,268,,
759,0.97,7230.523,7238.497,Imagine what tiny House villages could accomplish if they were really supported by City Hall rather than having to fight constantly for the right to exist.,268,,
760,0.97,7238.497,7249.542,Today we are passing this legislation to expand opportunities to build tiny House villages.,268,,
761,0.97,7249.542,7252.111,Tomorrow we will have to fight for the funding in the budget.,268,,
762,0.97,7252.111,7253.746,I do not mean tomorrow but this year.,268,,
763,0.97,7253.746,7308.267,"To make this expansion to all of the homeless people who have fought for tiny House villages today's victory belongs to you because of your dedication and courage and thank you to the churches and all of the leaders of different faith who have not only hosted tiny House villages but have spoken in favor and the neighbors of the villages who have shown that the majority of Seattle does not buy into the rhetoric and that we care about our homeless neighbors deeply and that we care about ending homelessness and thank you to Lihi, Nickelsville thank you for all of your organizing . The history of the struggle has shown that when we fight we can win and thank you to Councilmembers who voted against some of the worst amendments keeping this bill as it goes out strong.",268,,

781,0.97,7469.662,7502.895,Prachi Dave is an appointment by the community police Commission and is a senior attorney at the public defender Association that she is feeling one of the two positions reserved for people who have expertise in issues related to civil liberties to the accountability legislation adopted in 2017 reserved two positions for graduates of an accredited law school and members in good standing of the Washington State bar association with experience in the field of public defense and civil liberties law.,277,,

783,0.97,7534.527,7611.203,"Echohawk is executive director of the chief Seattle Club, and as founder of the coalition to end native homelessness that one of the issues that has been raised today is some concern about the fact that although Ms. Echohawk is a reappointment, she is taking the place of an individual that the Mayor declined to Reappoint to the CPC and this is an individual that I myself am Reappointing and this individual will be on the agenda for my committee and human services Committee on Tuesday and will be voting on that individual on Tuesday so the concerned that a current member of the CPC in good standing may not serve on the CPC is not an occurrence that is going to take place, and I moving forward with that person in spite of the fact that the Mayor the client to Reappoint her.",277,,
784,0.97,7611.203,7614.173,Are we doing them together?,278,,

793,0.97,7636.195,7692.918,Over the weekend I shared with Councilmembers a draft letter regarding the need for the Mayor to move forward on the finalizing of the contract for lead . As I mentioned this morning if request more information from the executive between the lead and the human services Department proposing allowing leaders to return Trey fully functioning program and as I think we are all aware is reaching a critical point where the effectiveness is compromised by Caseloads that are too high and the inability to serve previously referred individuals and the Council allocated 3.5 million to L.E.A.D.,282,,
794,0.97,7692.918,7696.155,To address the problems but the funding has not yet been committed to L.E.A.D.,282,,
795,0.97,7696.155,7740.199,And we are now the end of February and I think it is really critical to recognize that we all rely on the effectiveness of this program and its effectiveness throughout the city is really bound by the ability to take new referrals both from the police Department and referrals from your Stakeholders within the business community . We are hampering that ability to continue its effectiveness . I am really at a loss as to why we are at the end of February and this trusted community partner does not have the contract yet.,282,,
796,0.97,7740.199,7757.116,I am hoping that this letter that we are signing here today will amplify the sense of urgency that we feel.,282,,
