243,0.97,1335.534,1349.047,I'm often asked what explains the Councilmembers repeated strong emotional responses to the police murder of George Floyd with the Near-Total silence and total inaction on the recent SPD murders of others.,52,,
244,0.97,1349.047,1357.456,I just launched a Twitter poll to try to answer this question with a possible expedition being they were bad people.,52,,
245,0.97,1357.456,1358.657,The SPD is always right.,52,,
246,0.97,1358.657,1362.928,I didn't notice he died.,52,,
247,0.97,1362.928,1368.633,"Lastly, the SPD has reformed, and we have adequate accountability so there can't be a problem.",52,,
248,0.97,1368.633,1374.272,I would invite the Councilmembers to comment on Twitter if they think there are other reasons for their complacent and silence.,52,,
249,0.97,1374.272,1386.885,"Personally I believe the last option to be the explanation with the dissenting cognitive Dissonance created by questioning our accountability system is so great that you just assume these SPD murders must be justified, thereby avoiding question.",52,,
250,0.97,1386.885,1389.087,We need full civilian control of the police now.,52,,

306,0.97,1686.084,1689.954,I want to urge city Council to support the resolution urging Biden.,64,,
307,0.97,1689.954,1693.191,We are facing an unprecedented global pandemic.,64,,
308,0.97,1693.191,1698.897,These conditions call for a serious and rapid response.,64,,
309,0.97,1698.897,1703.568,Delaying vaccine access for nations by not using IP only hurts our chances as an international community to see an end to the pandemic.,64,,
310,0.97,1703.568,1708.406,By denying vaccines to other nations we will see more waves and more strains emerge.,64,,
311,0.97,1708.406,1711.676,Potentially seeing the vaccines become less effective.,64,,
312,0.97,1711.676,1713.912,Some folks might be thinking this is in the Seattle issue.,64,,
313,0.97,1713.912,1721.019,We can't afford to sit idly by when an important restriction of patent restriction puts us all at risk.,64,,
314,0.97,1721.019,1723.221,There is a precedent for Seattle to take a stand.,64,,
315,0.97,1723.221,1731.196,In February of last year Seattle passed a resolution opposing Islamophobic laws.,64,,
316,0.97,1731.196,1734.632,This resolution in the city set the tone for several other cities to take the same stance.,64,,
317,0.97,1734.632,1737.168,It led to the government to back away from passing that law.,64,,
318,0.97,1737.168,1743.141,It is clear what happens here in Seattle that's of international implementation.,64,,
319,0.97,1743.141,1746.444,We have the opportunity to not only do the easy thing but do the right thing.,64,,
320,0.97,1746.444,1747.045,Take a stand.,64,,

324,0.97,1756.121,1763.862,District 4. I'm here to urge city Council to pass the resolution.,66,,
325,0.97,1763.862,1771.169,All year the city Council has given lip service to acknowledging the origins of racism in this country.,66,,
326,0.97,1771.169,1776.474,We know that the origin of racism in the U.S. especially is private property.,66,,
327,0.97,1776.474,1787.452,"The same logic that enabled slavery now prevents countries, disproportionately countries formerly colonized and exploited by the U.S. and Europe from producing Covid vaccines that can save millions of lives.",66,,
328,0.97,1787.452,1795.794,To hoard the propping for MEGA Pharma companies is openly to put white Supremacist profits above all else.,66,,
329,0.97,1795.794,1811.409,Bill gates just publicly defended the Hoarding of vaccine patents it is veiled racism when India already produces already most of the generic brand medicines.,66,,
330,0.97,1811.409,1814.279,This makes it crucial for working people to take a stand against vaccine racism.,66,,
331,0.97,1814.279,1815.146,Thank you.,66,,
332,0.97,1815.146,1821.386,Thank you.,67,,
333,0.97,1821.386,1827.425,Hold on just a minute here.,67,,
334,0.97,1827.425,1840.438,I'm a Renter in the central district.,68,,
335,0.97,1840.438,1845.343,I'm calling in support of Councilmember Sawant's resolution.,68,,
336,0.97,1845.343,1855.053,A year ago we know like the city was at the epicenter of the Covid outbreak in the United States.,68,,
337,0.97,1855.053,1858.957,That is liable to be the case again if there are Unvaccinated people anywhere in the world.,68,,
338,0.97,1858.957,1864.462,"None of us are safe from new strains, and that includes here in Seattle.",68,,
339,0.97,1864.462,1869.167,I think that's also to say nothing of prolonging the cycle we Vardy seen of and the's Lockdowns and prematurely opening.,68,,
340,0.97,1869.167,1873.371,Working people have had to bear the brunt of the consequences.,68,,
341,0.97,1873.371,1876.641,This is a global crisis and we need to coordinate a global response.,68,,
342,0.97,1876.641,1885.783,I think the city council have the power to take a stand against preventing loss of life that is taking place right now.,68,,
343,0.97,1885.783,1890.054,Simply to defend the profits of these big pharmaceutical companies who were in reality totally negligent in preparing for this crisis.,68,,
344,0.97,1890.054,1891.456,These vaccines were developed with public funds.,68,,
345,0.97,1891.456,1898.997,There is a clear President with the Council stand against the citizenship law.,68,,
346,0.97,1898.997,1901.599,I urge the Council to follow that precedent again and pass this resolution.,68,,
347,0.97,1901.599,1902.0,Thank you.,68,,
348,0.97,1902.0,1905.203,Thank you.,69,,
349,0.97,1905.203,1912.176,I'm a Renter.,70,,
350,0.97,1912.176,1913.611,Can you hear me?,70,,
351,0.97,1913.611,1915.58,We can.,71,,
352,0.97,1915.58,1923.121,I'm a Renter in district 3.,72,,
353,0.97,1923.121,1930.428,The Seattle city council should absolutely be calling him President Biden to immediately waive patent restrictions on Covid vaccines.,72,,
354,0.97,1930.428,1934.932,Big pharmaceutical companies are making enormous profits by Hoarding vaccines for rich countries.,72,,
355,0.97,1934.932,1941.839,Why should they be allowed to profit when it was the billions of dollars of public research that made the Covid vaccine profitable?,72,,
356,0.97,1941.839,1946.311,I think the public working people everywhere should have free and immediate access to the vaccine.,72,,

431,0.97,2397.795,2398.796,Finally.,90,,
432,0.97,2398.796,2401.499,My apologies.,90,,

440,0.97,2426.891,2430.127,This is where the resolution comes in very strongly.,90,,
441,0.97,2430.127,2438.836,A leading NIH scientist said last week that the U.S.,90,,
442,0.97,2438.836,2450.848,Government's ownership of the patent for the invention gives the Biden administration significant leverage to compel pharmaceutical companies to help boost global production.,90,,
443,0.97,2450.848,2464.461,"The deputy director of the NIH's research center told the financial times, virtually everything that comes out of the government's research lab is a nonexclusive licensing agreement.",90,,
444,0.97,2464.461,2466.263,So that it doesn't get blocked by any particular company.,90,,
445,0.97,2466.263,2482.947,"In fact, prior to the WTO, and the proliferation of trade treaties, countries around the world regularly used compulsory licensing to make the pharmaceutical industry allow local manufacturers to produce drugs after paying a license fee.",90,,
446,0.97,2482.947,2491.088,It's estimated that nine out of 10 people in countries without the means to purchase patents and vaccines won't have access this year.,90,,
447,0.97,2491.088,2493.19,An analysis puts the inequality in stark terms.,90,,

458,0.97,2535.933,2539.236,We have seen that Biden has lifted the ban on exporting materials for vaccines to India.,92,,
459,0.97,2539.236,2549.813,This is definitely one step towards fixing Pre-Existing vaccine nationalism that has really focused on profit over accessibility.,92,,
460,0.97,2549.813,2555.853,Intellectual property rights around the Covid vaccine are absolutely limiting access right now.,92,,
461,0.97,2555.853,2564.228,The city council currently has an opportunity to push back against the WTO's rules that require countries to guarantee pharmaceutical corporations monopoly control.,92,,
462,0.97,2564.228,2570.668,Rapid production and distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine is essential.,92,,

474,0.97,2621.685,2624.054,This is not just a Seattle problem or the United States problem.,96,,
475,0.97,2624.054,2625.322,This is a global issue.,96,,
476,0.97,2625.322,2629.026,That will take a collective to solve.,96,,
477,0.97,2629.026,2634.698,It is wrong I feel to prevent anyone from having access to the vaccine.,96,,
478,0.97,2634.698,2637.935,For a few Billionaires and big Pharma can make record profits.,96,,
479,0.97,2637.935,2643.04,It is the humane and just thing to do for many lives can be saved.,96,,
480,0.97,2643.04,2644.708,I urge the Council to support the resolution.,96,,

493,0.97,2701.899,2721.018,"We can only end this world wide pandemic why moving beyond our preoccupation with privilege and legal constraint that continued to make individual corporate concerns more important, or equal, to the welfare of the common good of all humanity.",98,,

504,0.97,2800.197,2808.372,It is creating a large and very dangerous gap in vaccination rates between high income and low income countries.,101,,
505,0.97,2808.372,2815.679,"This enormous gap is important not just because of the unfairness of the world's core being left behind, but because of the rest the situation poses to the whole world.",101,,
506,0.97,2815.679,2821.318,The pandemic is allowed to spread unchecked through the developing world.,101,,
507,0.97,2821.318,2826.623,It's a certainty that we will see more mutations and we really don't want to mess around and find out how bad this thing can get.,101,,
508,0.97,2826.623,2831.094,"We should do everything possible to get the whole world Vaccinated as quickly as possible, which we clearly are not doing right now.",101,,
509,0.97,2831.094,2838.635,The U.S. and other wealthy countries insist on maintaining these patents and intellectual property rights which we know are not necessarily for innovation.,101,,
510,0.97,2838.635,2841.838,Most of this research was funded by taxpayers.,101,,
511,0.97,2841.838,2846.109,We should have to put people's lives over corporate profits during this unprecedented human crisis.,101,,

521,0.97,2878.375,2886.149,The Trump admission led opposition to the WTO Covid-19 waiver when South Africa and India first proposed it.,105,,
522,0.97,2886.149,2894.091,"Because WTO decisions are taken by consensus, the U.S. and very few others WTO members were able to block the waiver.",105,,
523,0.97,2894.091,2896.426,Even though the proposal had support from over 100 other countries.,105,,
524,0.97,2896.426,2898.762,"After three months, U.S.",105,,
525,0.97,2898.762,2907.07,Officials in the Biden administration have maintained that composition in the WTO.,105,,
526,0.97,2907.07,2912.009,"We can't have faith that capitalism will follow this crisis when it central motor, the drive for profit, stands in the way of global vaccination.",105,,
527,0.97,2912.009,2919.216,It's going to take mass special from below to force Biden's hand in the Demetrio.,105,,

688,0.97,4004.367,4006.402,Government to sanction companies to use that tool.,140,,
689,0.97,4006.402,4019.181,These corporations have also undermined this option by building pickets of intellectual property values.,140,,
690,0.97,4019.181,4029.925,"They fortify their monopolies by registering exclusive lights to industrial design and undisclosed data such as trade secrets and test data, in addition to numerous patents and copyrights reach medicine.",140,,
691,0.97,4029.925,4054.95,Each element would require a license . This up at from these authors captures exactly the kind of network of licenses the WTO imposes to make it impossible for countries to do what is needed to save lives.,140,,
692,0.97,4054.95,4069.565,"All Council members have received important letters from the Washington fair trade coalition and from the Association, and also from Hindus for human rights, supporting this resolution and urging the Council to vote yes today.",140,,

696,0.97,4123.819,4125.888,A general council meeting due in early May.,141,,
697,0.97,4125.888,4133.696,Activists and organizers around the world are fighting for the waiver and are building momentum to prepare for those upcoming WTO meetings.,141,,
698,0.97,4133.696,4143.439,This resolution will join the Seattle city council as one part of the effort if it passes today.,141,,
699,0.97,4143.439,4154.85,My hope is that this resolution will inspire other cities to do the same to make it clear to the Biden administration that we will not accept a continued policy of vaccine nationalism.,141,,
700,0.97,4154.85,4167.663,"We can see how building movements can win victories, just in the passed couple days the Biden administration was finally forced to concede and send some vaccine materials and doses to India, which they previously refused to do.",141,,
701,0.97,4167.663,4181.277,"We should recognize that this is a victory, but only a first step . It is not a substitute or an excuse for refusing to carry out the tips waiver and allowing every country around the world to make the vaccines they need.",141,,
702,0.97,4181.277,4184.213,"On the one side, we have the health and safety of all of humanity.",141,,

704,0.97,4191.487,4195.891,I hope all Council members decide to stand with human life and not billionaire profit.,141,,

712,0.97,4233.829,4236.131,Second.,145,,
713,0.97,4236.131,4239.134,Thank you so much.,146,,
714,0.97,4239.134,4241.203,"Councilmember Herbold, please feel free to address the amendment.",146,,
715,0.97,4241.203,4243.639,Thank you.,147,,
716,0.97,4243.639,4247.91,"I was hoping that the language could just be incorporated in the resolution, but I ran out of time.",147,,
717,0.97,4247.91,4274.27,"It just simply is that the changes are simply intended to elevate the fact that during a global pandemic, the destinies of the people in our city are especially connected to the destinies of folks in other cities.",147,,
718,0.97,4274.27,4277.773,Particularly those cities who have less access to vaccine.,147,,
719,0.97,4277.773,4292.021,"So, the amendment adds recitals to emphasize the importance of disseminating vaccination everywhere to develop herd immunity.",147,,
720,0.97,4292.021,4298.994,"Again, that is something that must be done in a way that can help all of us.",147,,
721,0.97,4298.994,4316.578,The amendment also recognizes that new Covid Variants continue to develop throughout the world and the importance of giving vaccines worldwide can increase the likelihood of success in the battle against Covid-19.,147,,
722,0.97,4316.578,4323.218,It emphasize the importance of Vaccinations to reopening both in developed and in the developed countries and in the global South.,147,,

725,0.97,4336.832,4337.132,Thank you.,147,,
726,0.97,4337.132,4340.336,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,148,,

733,0.97,4397.393,4398.761,"Councilmember Pedersen, please.",150,,
734,0.97,4398.761,4404.7,"Thank you, Council President.",151,,
735,0.97,4404.7,4412.207,"I appreciate the good intentions of this resolution 32004, and the amendments that I just voted for.",151,,
736,0.97,4412.207,4418.914,I believe we all share the goals to have the Covid vaccine widely available here and throughout the globe.,151,,
737,0.97,4418.914,4420.382,I believe we agree on that goal.,151,,
738,0.97,4420.382,4434.329,"I also believe our experienced congressional delegation, are more than capable of providing advocacy and oversight on the issues Impacting the nation and international relations.",151,,
739,0.97,4434.329,4440.636,"That includes how best to curtail the pandemic, as quickly as possible across the nation and abroad.",151,,
740,0.97,4440.636,4451.847,"Once again, I think we are reminded of the limitations of our own Council rules, which do not currently allow Councilmembers to abstain, even on nonbinding resolutions.",151,,
741,0.97,4451.847,4469.665,"I believe an extension would be appropriate while we might agree on the Overarching method, but might not have the bandwidth to research the details as we deal with the multiple crises in our own city, or we might not have the expertise and important underlying details.",151,,
742,0.97,4469.665,4485.08,"For example, I believe it's important to research these details, but because of the speed at which this came about, I'm not able to Delve into the matters of pharmaceutical intellectual property, or WTO agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights.",151,,
743,0.97,4485.08,4488.784,And other issues.,151,,
744,0.97,4488.784,4499.161,"I also do not believe this particular issue is within the scope of our influence as the legislative body of a city, nor is it directly tied to our duties under the Charter of the city.",151,,
745,0.97,4499.161,4502.564,"With no ability to abstain on this resolution, I'll have to be voting no.",151,,
746,0.97,4502.564,4503.398,Thank you.,151,,
747,0.97,4503.398,4506.702,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",152,,
748,0.97,4506.702,4513.609,Are there any additional comments on the resolution as amended?,152,,
749,0.97,4513.609,4516.612,"Councilmember Sawant, as the sponsor, you get the last word to close out debate.",152,,
750,0.97,4516.612,4518.814,"Then, we are going to call the roll.",152,,
751,0.97,4518.814,4523.318,"Thank you, president Gonzalez.",153,,
752,0.97,4523.318,4527.823,"I just wanted to respond to Councilmember Pedersen quickly, and then make a few other comments.",153,,
753,0.97,4527.823,4549.545,"Councilmember Pedersen said I believe we all share the goal that vaccine should be available for everyone globally, but if Councilmembers are planning to vote no on this resolution, or even wanting, expressing the desire to abstain on this issue, then no, then we don't share that goal.",153,,
754,0.97,4549.545,4571.667,"If you share the goal that the vaccine should be available, as an elective representative at any level, one should be not only willing to, but eager to fight for the rights of all working people, but in this situation, this is a question of human catastrophe that is happening at an unprecedented scale.",153,,
755,0.97,4571.667,4582.844,"I think that it is simply impossible, and it is unconscionable to view this issue solely through the narrow lens of what the Seattle city charter says.",153,,
756,0.97,4582.844,4587.749,It has to be viewed through the lens of moral and political obligation of this moment.,153,,
757,0.97,4587.749,4597.893,"I just wanted to add the point that, this is very much related to Seattle city council responsibility.",153,,
758,0.97,4597.893,4612.808,"We know that because it is a pandemic, which means it's a global epidemic, public health experts are warning us that the virus has the capability of spreading, multiplying and Mutating, in different parts of the world.",153,,
759,0.97,4612.808,4630.392,"The only way as Councilmember Herbold said for us to help keep everyone safe is to reach the degree of herd immunity that Epidemiological statisticians are recommending that we urgently reach, which is going to be impossible without billions of people having access to the vaccine.",153,,
760,0.97,4630.392,4636.698,Which in turn will be impossible without those necessary first steps under the WTO trips waiver.,153,,
761,0.97,4636.698,4649.044,I don't see how you can stand for Seattle's working people and the Seattle community without also standing up for the access to vaccines globally.,153,,
762,0.97,4649.044,4651.88,They are just mutually exclusive in the case of a pandemic.,153,,
763,0.97,4651.88,4662.457,"In other words, not ensuring that the whole world has access to the book seen makes playing Russian roulette with the lives of people in America and Seattle.",153,,
764,0.97,4662.457,4671.833,"The city councils resolution is going to be but one step, important step, but it is just one step forward.",153,,
765,0.97,4671.833,4676.872,"We will need other elected officials to also weigh in, and I'm hoping this resolution passes so we put that example forward.",153,,
766,0.97,4676.872,4696.625,"I also just wanted to add that big Pharma and the elected officials in Congress, including many cabinet appointees in the Biden administration claim that intellectual property rights and the massive profits for big Pharma are necessary to create an incentive to develop future vaccines and treatments.",153,,
767,0.97,4696.625,4698.66,We should be recognizing that this is a complete lie.,153,,
768,0.97,4698.66,4706.568,The reality is that no clinical innovation would be possible without overwhelming amounts of public funding.,153,,
769,0.97,4706.568,4716.912,And without overwhelming amount of work by armies of dedicated researchers and scientists.,153,,
770,0.97,4716.912,4720.582,"These are salaried employees, not Billionaires.",153,,
771,0.97,4720.582,4731.793,"Yet, once clinical innovations are available, the prophets all go to the Billionaires, not to the ordinary people, billions around the world who have contributed to make this research possible.",153,,
772,0.97,4731.793,4753.849,"For instance, the New York Times reported that one of the heroes in the development of the groundbreaking Mrna technology that has made Covid vaccines possible and has been the backbone of this Life- saving vaccine, spent her career going from publicly funded lab to publicly funded lab, supported by government LABS.",153,,
773,0.97,4753.849,4755.317,"Never herself making more than $50,000 a year.",153,,
774,0.97,4755.317,4757.152,This is not new.,153,,
775,0.97,4757.152,4777.038,"We know this is happened with eight Medications, and also in 2007, when the intellectual property rights to the Epipen were purchased by a pharmaceutical company it increased the wholesale price sixfold from $100 in 2009 to $609 in 2016.",153,,
776,0.97,4777.038,4789.618,All of this logic was purely demonstrated in an investing article on CNBC last Wednesday titled Goldman Sachs asks . is curing patients a sustainable business model?,153,,
777,0.97,4789.618,4821.116,"In other words, Goldman Sachs, which is an absolutely notorious Wall Street corporation, they are having to acknowledge publicly that while having one shot cures, their research is completely possible giving our technical ability today, while one shot cures are extremely beneficial to humanity as a whole, not only saving lives but presenting any kind of misery people face.",153,,
778,0.97,4821.116,4830.025,"It is not good for the profit and more importantly, the repeated and chronic profit making a big Pharma.",153,,
779,0.97,4830.025,4834.93,It shows the logic of capitalism itself is completely in conflict with the needs of humanity.,153,,
780,0.97,4834.93,4848.476,"We should remember, in 1999, the people of Seattle took to the streets to protest the WTO meeting, inspiring an international movement against corporate globalization.",153,,
781,0.97,4848.476,4859.721,This is what the movement was protesting against International trade agreements like WTO are written by the capitalist belief from around the globe to defend their profits against working people across the globe.,153,,
782,0.97,4859.721,4870.665,That is why we need International solidarity and I wanted to thank all the organizations who have helped Úwith this resolution and strongly build support for it.,153,,
783,0.97,4870.665,4879.441,"I especially want to thank everybody of course who has lent their support for this, but I especially wanted to recognize the coalition of Seattle Indian Americans.",153,,
784,0.97,4879.441,4889.584,The Washington fair trade coalition and alternative organizations are really built strong support for this resolution.,153,,
785,0.97,4889.584,4899.761,"As I said, it will be a small but very crucial step in building momentum for the April 30th trips council meeting.",153,,
786,0.97,4899.761,4915.377,"Calling for a protest on April 30th, let's end the status quo of billionaire given, billionaire profit driven apartheid and vaccine nationalism and save millions of lives by winning vaccine internationalism and a people's vaccine.",153,,
787,0.97,4915.377,4918.813,Let's make sure that we build on that in the United States by winning Medicare for all.,153,,
788,0.97,4918.813,4919.614,In Queue.,153,,
789,0.97,4919.614,4922.684,Thank you so much.,154,,
790,0.97,4922.684,4926.721,That does conclude debate on this particular item.,154,,
791,0.97,4926.721,4931.726,At this point I'm going to ask that the court please call the roll on the adoption of the resolution as amended.,154,,
