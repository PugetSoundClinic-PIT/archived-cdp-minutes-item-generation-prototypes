327,0.97,1526.458,1529.127,The only difference is a matter of money.,72,,
328,0.97,1529.127,1534.366,Last week the council voted to spend the millions on police instead of housing.,72,,
329,0.97,1534.366,1539.07,The vote was a betrayal of your commitment.,72,,

338,0.97,1566.464,1566.932,Hello.,74,,
339,0.97,1566.932,1571.77,I also am extremely disappointed in the decision last Thursday.,74,,
340,0.97,1571.77,1585.45,I find it incredibly disappointing but we have the opportunity with Councilmember Mosqueda's amendment to cut SPD's hiring budget by 2 million and invest in community alternatives.,74,,
341,0.97,1585.45,1592.49,It is vital that despite the very disappointing actions on Thursday.,74,,
342,0.97,1592.49,1602.867,I am encouraging please all Council members to vote yes for Councilmember Mosqueda's amendment.,74,,
343,0.97,1602.867,1603.268,It's important.,74,,
344,0.97,1603.268,1626.124,We know the harmful effects of SPD and it is vitally important to reinvest in the communities that are most affected and most vulnerable to the damages of the SPD.,74,,

349,0.97,1634.899,1644.776,Was disappointed to see the vote to hire more police officers next year despite the community demanding to have less of a police presence.,76,,
350,0.97,1644.776,1648.046,Please listen to everyone calling saying police do not make them feel safe.,76,,
351,0.97,1648.046,1661.126,"What makes them feel safe is having a community that loves and supports them, having a roof over their head, having all your basic needs met so you are not anxious about what bills to pay this month.",76,,
352,0.97,1661.126,1666.464,The funding needs to come from our overly funded police Department.,76,,
353,0.97,1666.464,1673.738,Crimes have gone up this year despite the high funded police Department because police do not prevent violence.,76,,
354,0.97,1673.738,1677.042,They show up after or directly contribute to the violence.,76,,
355,0.97,1677.042,1687.285,People calling in have been working hard to fill gaps in care left by our city government.,76,,

362,0.97,1708.907,1713.945,Please do what you can to live to the commitment you made this summer to Kurt the police budget.,78,,
363,0.97,1713.945,1717.248,I would like to know why you did that this summer?,78,,
364,0.97,1717.248,1722.42,I would like for you to be curious about why you committed to that.,78,,

384,0.97,1801.833,1810.175,For the solidarity budget I was disappointed in your vote to hire more SPD officers.,81,,
385,0.97,1810.175,1813.711,I support amendment to transfer $2 million.,81,,
386,0.97,1813.711,1816.915,We shouldn't be hiring more cops weill reducing responsibilities.,81,,
387,0.97,1816.915,1818.116,It's paying more for less.,81,,
388,0.97,1818.116,1828.193,I understand some people are concerned about Defunding because they see some Failings of our current public safety system.,81,,
389,0.97,1828.193,1831.829,"The Failings are Failings, reasons to Defund and rebuild a new system.",81,,
390,0.97,1831.829,1838.069,Failings in the current are not reasons to double down on the current system and hire more Úpolice.,81,,

397,0.97,1859.757,1868.333,I would like to speak on the hot issue of Seattle police Department and 2021 budget and moving forward going back to something more general.,83,,
398,0.97,1868.333,1870.301,20% is not enough.,83,,

400,0.97,1874.939,1879.377,We want at minimum a 50% reduction.,83,,
401,0.97,1879.377,1879.577,Why?,83,,
402,0.97,1879.577,1882.347,We have people being victimized by the police.,83,,
403,0.97,1882.347,1885.617,Seattle police Department are murdering people.,83,,
404,0.97,1885.617,1894.759,They have too many that do not belong to people with guns and people are dying and will continue to die if we don't do something big and do something now.,83,,
405,0.97,1894.759,1909.207,I call for at minimum 50% budget reduction with that money used for projects that will help people out of poverty rather than throwing it at people with guns to shoot the problem until it stops.,83,,
406,0.97,1909.207,1922.12,Funding people who kill people makes you an accomplice to murder.,83,,
407,0.97,1922.12,1922.654,Thank you.,84,,

410,0.97,1935.967,1938.67,This feels like a slap in the face.,85,,
411,0.97,1938.67,1951.449,On November 4Spd put a Protester in serious condition and left their body on the ground for 15 minutes while they used force against concerned citizens.,85,,

522,0.97,2311.776,2319.116,I will take over.,138,,
523,0.97,2319.116,2319.583,This is Spd025B002.,138,,
524,0.97,2319.583,2321.952,"I introduce myself, Greg dos, central staff.",138,,
525,0.97,2321.952,2325.556,Good morning Madam chair and members of the committee.,138,,
526,0.97,2325.556,2329.827,This particular item is not a technical item.,138,,
527,0.97,2329.827,2341.439,This is an item that would change funding for SPD's hiring plan.,138,,
528,0.97,2341.439,2352.016,"Shall I describe it, Councilmember, chair Mosqueda and I have new information that hasn't been discussed during Council budget session that I might add at the chair's pleasure.",138,,
529,0.97,2352.016,2353.184,Sure.,139,,
530,0.97,2353.184,2354.285,Thanks so much.,139,,
531,0.97,2354.285,2354.552,Okay.,140,,
532,0.97,2354.552,2364.628,"This CBA would reduce 2 million in salary funding for sworn officers and reduce SPD's annual average funded FTE to 1,343.",140,,
533,0.97,2364.628,2383.08,"This assumes there will be equal number of hires and separations, one 14 hires and one 14 separations in 2021 because recent trends and lead to believe that it will be higher than projected in SPD staffing plan.",140,,
534,0.97,2383.08,2396.46,As you will recall SPD staffing plan that was transmitted in October indicated there would be 114 hires but there would only be 89 separations.,140,,
535,0.97,2396.46,2404.201,So this particular CBA would assume separations would increase from 89 to 114.,140,,
536,0.97,2404.201,2415.646,Then the cut of $2 million to account for the separations would leave the Department with 1343 funded Fde.,140,,
537,0.97,2415.646,2432.229,"Additional information that's come up over the weekend that members have not had the opportunity to hear during the budget process is that in October, there were 16 additional separations from the police Department.",140,,
538,0.97,2432.229,2444.842,"With the trends in September and October, that would certainly seem to indicate SPD's attrition is higher than expected in 2020 and could be higher than expected in 2021.",140,,
539,0.97,2444.842,2460.891,"What I would NOTE is that the additional attrition in 2020 is 16 officers and those 16 officers, they won't need to be paid in 2021 because they won't be there.",140,,
540,0.97,2460.891,2483.681,"Because they're not going to be there, that will lower the need for salary for SPD by about 2.3 million and will mean that the SPD will only reach if hiring is according to plan.",140,,
541,0.97,2483.681,2489.787,I think it's important to note that this particular action cuts 2 million.,140,,
542,0.97,2489.787,2500.898,It does not in any way Memorialize a hiring plan number that would assume 114 Attritions or would assume 114 hires.,140,,
543,0.97,2500.898,2505.336,It just cuts 2 million in salary funding for SPD.,140,,
544,0.97,2505.336,2515.312,As I indicated prior basically that amount is no longer going to be needed because of the additional attrition in 2020.,140,,
545,0.97,2515.312,2528.859,"That said, executive has provided a response that indicates that they believe that there is a good possibility that they would Hiremore than 114.",140,,
546,0.97,2528.859,2538.769,"If they hired more than 114, then this funding that would be reduced would be needed for that additional hiring.",140,,
547,0.97,2538.769,2546.744,I have provided to Council members some history about SPD's hiring over the last seven years.,140,,
548,0.97,2546.744,2558.155,They have not reached 114 in the last seven years and the highest I believe they've gone is 108.,140,,
549,0.97,2558.155,2581.712,"Another thing executive notes that I think is important is if the funding is taken here, that does reduce executive's ability to use over time to back fill for patrol losses and might mean they have to transfer into 911 response officers from other units from investigative or speciality units.",140,,
550,0.97,2581.712,2591.588,"Finally, that there would be separation pay that would be needed to be given to additional officers who are leaving and that amount would not be present in their budget.",140,,
551,0.97,2591.588,2597.494,That's a little bit of context for this particular issue.,140,,
552,0.97,2597.494,2604.835,"They do not agree, the executive, with the 114 separation assumption.",140,,
553,0.97,2604.835,2614.278,They do agree that the separations this year would mean that there would be a need to revise separation assumption in the 2021 staffing plan.,140,,
554,0.97,2614.278,2619.683,But that has not happened and cannot happen between now and this afternoon.,140,,
555,0.97,2619.683,2627.424,"As I NOTE before, the staffing plan is not something that is memorialized in any legislation.",140,,
556,0.97,2627.424,2632.062,Council only has control over the funding that goes to SPD.,140,,
557,0.97,2632.062,2637.067,"With that as context, I would offer to answer any questions that members might have.",140,,
558,0.97,2637.067,2643.707,Let's put this in front of us.,141,,
559,0.97,2643.707,2649.313,I move approval of CB Sspd025B001.,141,,
560,0.97,2649.313,2651.148,Is there a second?,141,,
561,0.97,2651.148,2652.049,Second.,142,,
562,0.97,2652.049,2652.383,Excuse me.,143,,
563,0.97,2652.383,2660.024,I believe it is 002.,143,,
564,0.97,2660.024,2667.998,I am sorry . S Pd25B002.,144,,
565,0.97,2667.998,2669.299,Is there a second.,144,,
566,0.97,2669.299,2669.6,Second.,145,,
567,0.97,2669.6,2672.202,Thank you very much for that.,146,,
568,0.97,2672.202,2677.908,This is corrective technical amendment in nature based on revised attrition rates we received Friday.,146,,
569,0.97,2677.908,2687.918,It is making sure that we are informing our budget here based on updated attrition numbers and assumptions we have seen from the experienced October numbers.,146,,
570,0.97,2687.918,2694.091,This amendment is technical in nature in that it reflects new assumed rate of attrition.,146,,
571,0.97,2694.091,2704.601,It does not in any way Memorialize any hiring commitments and we can always make sure we address potential need if and when they arrive.,146,,
572,0.97,2704.601,2714.411,We are simply reflecting there is no longer going to be seen the same level of attrition anticipated at the very beginning of this budget cycle.,146,,
573,0.97,2714.411,2726.623,"Colleagues, this is an attempt to make sure our budget is reflective of the numbers.",146,,
574,0.97,2726.623,2727.157,Additional comments?,147,,
575,0.97,2727.157,2734.231,"Seeing none, call role on approval.",148,,
576,0.97,2734.231,2735.699,Please go ahead Councilman Pedersen.,149,,
577,0.97,2735.699,2737.234,Sorry.,150,,
578,0.97,2737.234,2741.338,I thought there would be questions about this.,150,,
579,0.97,2741.338,2742.139,May I?,150,,
580,0.97,2742.139,2743.607,Go ahead.,151,,
581,0.97,2743.607,2744.274,Thank you.,152,,
582,0.97,2744.274,2747.878,"Thank you, Greg, for trying to paint the full picture of this.",152,,
583,0.97,2747.878,2756.253,I heard you say at the beginning it is not a technical amendment.,152,,
584,0.97,2756.253,2764.561,I just want to--I guess I just want to understand the impact of this.,152,,
585,0.97,2764.561,2775.672,I know last week we had achieved sort of a ballot funding for SPD and then this is coming in pretty late in the process.,152,,
586,0.97,2775.672,2780.777,So I just want to have a better understanding of it.,152,,
587,0.97,2780.777,2786.116,It appears that it's not reflected in the staffing plan.,152,,
588,0.97,2786.116,2796.493,"I know we had relied on that, on the staffing plan a bit last week whereas SPD is now telling us that they don't agree with the number.",152,,
589,0.97,2796.493,2802.266,They think they maybe can hire more than 114 next year.,152,,
590,0.97,2802.266,2813.71,Is it true--they also might need funding for over time if they were to have to fill in patrol shifts.,152,,
591,0.97,2813.71,2815.045,That's a question for Greg.,152,,
592,0.97,2815.045,2820.517,"I think the answer to that is yes, to all the things you said.",153,,
593,0.97,2820.517,2830.327,They believe that they can hire more than 114 and so they would like to retain the funding to leave them the flexibility to do that.,153,,
594,0.97,2830.327,2837.134,They would like to retain funding to use it for over time to back fill patrol losses.,153,,
595,0.97,2837.134,2840.704,They would like to retain funding for separation pay.,153,,
596,0.97,2840.704,2845.542,I think all the things are% true.,153,,
597,0.97,2845.542,2870.901,"It is also true that the staffing plan as it is currently presented to the Council in October, they would not reach the funded FTE of 1343 given the newest separations, they would not reach that level unless they were able to hire more.",153,,
598,0.97,2870.901,2875.539,So those are I think all true.,153,,
599,0.97,2875.539,2876.907,Madam chair.,154,,
600,0.97,2876.907,2878.375,Welcome interim director.,155,,
601,0.97,2878.375,2879.376,Please go ahead.,155,,
602,0.97,2879.376,2879.776,Thank you.,156,,
603,0.97,2879.776,2896.927,"This is all very late breaking news as you heard from Greg and from the budget chair, updated information about separations in October came to us late on Friday afternoon or even in the evening.",156,,
604,0.97,2896.927,2898.362,I don't recall which.,156,,
605,0.97,2898.362,2917.814,We have been working to understand and had some back and forth with CBO and executive general about implications of the amendment which you are now discussing.,156,,
606,0.97,2917.814,2937.334,I think it is important context to understand that the executive had opportunity to provide us with feedback they believed they could be hiring SPD officers in 2021.,156,,
607,0.97,2937.334,2979.576,"They did not avail themselves of the opportunity when we were considering and Council budget committee took action on separate budget action Spd009A003, that action cut $6.1 million out of SPD's budget on essentially the same theory that there were more separations than hiring plan anticipated in 2020 and that SPD therefore would not be able to spend $6.1 million on salaries in 2021 for officers who are not with the city any longer.",156,,
608,0.97,2979.576,3004.601,I just want to point out that while Greg is absolutely correct that we have received as recently as early this morning a response that says it's possible they can hire more than 114 new officers.,156,,
609,0.97,3004.601,3021.852,That is not information which we had previously received about another budget action which cut $6.1 million out of SPD's budget on the same theory that the budget action that you are not considering incorporates.,156,,
610,0.97,3021.852,3025.422,I just provide that context.,156,,
611,0.97,3025.422,3029.426,"Thank you very much, interim director.",157,,
612,0.97,3029.426,3031.294,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",157,,
613,0.97,3031.294,3031.728,Thank you.,158,,
614,0.97,3031.728,3052.949,"On this question for Greg in response to an E-mail he sent over the weekend, hopefully addressing the concern from Councilmember Pedersen about funds to address costs associated with expended over time.",158,,
615,0.97,3052.949,3083.079,"The E-mail I received says now that the plan can only reach 1,341 Ftes, the Council could expand Spd009A3 to include another 2.3 million, rough estimate ...",158,,
616,0.97,3083.079,3100.997,Keep in mind that the additional 2.3 million cut can take away the ability to use over time to back fill for patrol losses and exacerbate situation where the chief is having to transfer into patrol officers working in investigative and speciality units.,158,,
617,0.97,3100.997,3106.203,"As I understand it, is that 2.3 million is there still for the purpose?",158,,
618,0.97,3106.203,3121.818,"I am having a hard time Conceptualizing how we are not double counting with the Councilmember's amendment but from my understanding of what you write here, it is not and there is still the $2.3 million cushion.",158,,
619,0.97,3121.818,3122.219,Is that correct?,158,,
620,0.97,3122.219,3129.526,I think that's true if the assumption of the amendment of 114 separations pans out.,159,,
621,0.97,3129.526,3150.347,"Yes, there would be in addition to the $2 million that is cut by Councilmember Mosqueda's amendment, another 2.3 million that's affected by additional separations that happened in October.",159,,
622,0.97,3150.347,3211.074,"As a follow up, one of the reasons why I have been feeling that Council member or budget chair Mosqueda's action is not problematic because it is in keeping with budget actions that we have already taken which is basically removing from the budget funds that cannot be spent under the Department's hiring plan assumptions and that this is in essence doing now what Council President Gonzalez was saying we would do later with her proviso that basically committed to scooping funds from greater than anticipated Attritions or separations in 2021.",160,,
623,0.97,3211.074,3216.213,We are doing now what we were planning on doing later.,160,,
624,0.97,3216.213,3231.228,I Thursday into Friday the part that's hanging me up is how I am counting the 16 additional Attritions we have just learned about over and above what was projected for October.,160,,
625,0.97,3231.228,3265.061,"So if I am counting them as part of this budget action, if I am saying chair Mosqueda's assumptions are there will be 25 more Attritions than anticipated but we already have 16 just in October, so this projection that we are going to have more Attritions than anticipated looks pretty confirmed because we are 16 of 25 already there.",160,,
626,0.97,3265.061,3280.744,"That means we only need nine more Attritions than anticipated for months of November, December, and all of the 12 months of 2021.",160,,
627,0.97,3280.744,3294.09,"When I consider that as it relates to this amendment, how do the 16 additional Attritions relate to the 2.3 million in the 2020 budget?",160,,
628,0.97,3294.09,3295.725,Am I double counting them?,160,,
629,0.97,3295.725,3299.062,That's what I am trying to figure out here.,160,,
630,0.97,3299.062,3327.657,"What I would say is this, if the 16 additional attrition, 16 additional separations in 2020 are annualized in 2021 meaning you don't have to pay the 16 officers in 2021, that reduces the amount of money that the Department needs to affect staffing plan by $2.3 million.",161,,
631,0.97,3327.657,3332.996,That happens irrespective of of what the amendment does.,161,,
632,0.97,3332.996,3347.944,"This amendment obviously reduces by $2 million, not quite as much as the actual Costae leave Asian that the Department will have because of the 16.",161,,
633,0.97,3347.944,3365.161,I would say if nothing changes this amendment takes away money that is actually a little bit less than what the Department will have cost savings for the 16 that are not going to be paid in 2021.,161,,
634,0.97,3365.161,3375.472,"Separately, over and above, if there are actually 114 attrition in 2021, there will be more money.",161,,
635,0.97,3375.472,3376.906,There will be $2 million more.,161,,
636,0.97,3376.906,3396.326,"So if you take those two things together, there is about $4.3 million of savings that the Department would have, number 1 from the 16 not paid next year and, number 2, from the greater attrition that would happen.",161,,
637,0.97,3396.326,3406.402,"Council is only taking with this action, 2 million.",161,,
638,0.97,3406.402,3416.813,"So trying not to conflict the actions, council is taking ...",161,,
639,0.97,3416.813,3420.383,Úto some extent there is Alread greater separation.,161,,
640,0.97,3420.383,3423.72,That will leave about 2.3 million in savings.,161,,
641,0.97,3423.72,3442.939,Just from a funding perspective and again noting that the staffing plan is not adopted this amendment will not take more money than the Department will already be saving because of the 16 more that have left in October.,161,,
642,0.97,3442.939,3443.606,Is that clear?,161,,
643,0.97,3443.606,3449.445,I will look to my colleague to tell if there is any context he can provide.,161,,
644,0.97,3449.445,3449.879,Thank you.,162,,
645,0.97,3449.879,3452.549,"Nodding heads, so that's a good sign.",163,,
646,0.97,3452.549,3455.852,That makes good sense to me as well.,164,,
647,0.97,3455.852,3464.561,I have personally been thinking about this as two explanations for how to cover the roughly $2 million.,164,,
648,0.97,3464.561,3486.216,"It's either the case that you want to count on the separations that passed in October of this year being annualized in 2021 or want to adjust up words in 2021, number of separations that the Council wants to base its budget upon.",164,,
649,0.97,3486.216,3495.859,"That secondary consideration is a departure, a rationale reasonable responsible response to the actions we have seen in 2020.",164,,
650,0.97,3495.859,3510.54,"But it is a departure from SPD's staffing plan because it increases from what SPD has otherwise been forecasting, number of separations from 89 to 114.",164,,
651,0.97,3510.54,3527.69,You could think of it as additive but it would be more conservative if you will to think of it as alternate explanation for how to rationale eyes cutting $2 million additional funds from SPD's budget.,164,,
652,0.97,3527.69,3535.598,I would note that SPD also introduced another potential departure from their staffing plan as we discussed earlier.,164,,
653,0.97,3535.598,3545.575,We had heretofore been assuming that 114 was the ceiling for how many new hires could happen in '21.,164,,
654,0.97,3545.575,3549.279,They are now saying that 114 may not be the true ceiling.,164,,
655,0.97,3549.279,3557.42,They may be able to achieve a higher than that number and number of new eyes.,164,,
656,0.97,3557.42,3567.463,If that's the case then the hiring staffing plan is all up for grabs if you will.,164,,
657,0.97,3567.463,3568.131,Thank you.,165,,
658,0.97,3568.131,3587.216,"I want to lift up complementary aspects with Gonzalez's earlier amendments to capture cost savings from known vacancies and appreciate that that has been discussed in the budget, appreciate the explanation that there is always the ability to address additional needs they come up with.",165,,
659,0.97,3587.216,3591.321,There is a buffer here and there will be ongoing conversation.,165,,
660,0.97,3591.321,3600.797,"I know about this and as we go into next year, given various Provisos in place so we can get good reporting.",165,,
661,0.97,3600.797,3602.131,"Thank you very much, colleagues.",165,,
662,0.97,3602.131,3604.901,Council President Gonzalez.,165,,
663,0.97,3604.901,3605.368,Thank you.,166,,
664,0.97,3605.368,3614.11,A quick question and then I might want to make comments before we take a final vote here.,166,,
665,0.97,3614.11,3628.458,But I want to allow conversation to continue before doing so.,166,,
666,0.97,3628.458,3632.762,Greg and or Dan.,166,,
667,0.97,3632.762,3668.531,"Another mechanism is in addition to the $6.1 million reduction to SPD's budget to reflect modulation if you will of their proposed hiring plan, there is also a 5 Million- dollar proviso based on expectation that attrition may be higher than what's forecasted by the police Department.",166,,
668,0.97,3668.531,3680.943,Can you explain to me what if any is the connection between the $5 million proviso and this budget action that's being proposed by chair Mosqueda?,166,,
669,0.97,3680.943,3683.379,I will take a shot at that.,167,,
670,0.97,3683.379,3690.019,I think the easiest way to think about them is they are not related.,167,,
671,0.97,3690.019,3707.87,Easiest way to think about it is the chair's amendment assumes 114 additional hires and that would net savings of $2 million and that the 16 that left in in October would net another 2.3 million.,167,,
672,0.97,3707.87,3734.13,"Talking about the 16 that left in October that would net 2.3 million in salary savings, that money would be held by your proviso Councilmember Gonzalo and that money would be available to Council to Reprogram or let SPD keep for over time or for separation pay or for anything else that might come up.",167,,
673,0.97,3734.13,3750.78,"If it is the case that 114 separations do not occur, then that money would be available to give back to the police Department for any additional costs that they might incur.",167,,
674,0.97,3750.78,3757.854,Because it would be held by your proviso next year.,167,,
675,0.97,3757.854,3779.142,The proviso was intended to hold funding from miscalculations with the staffing plan in 2021 but it could certainly grab this 2.3 million from the 16 officers that won't be paid in 2021 because that is salary Savings and that is related to the staffing plan.,167,,
676,0.97,3779.142,3788.518,"A quick follow up, even if we--so there are already 16 positions.",168,,
677,0.97,3788.518,3794.39,There are potential salary savings already related to the $5 million proviso in 2021.,168,,
678,0.97,3794.39,3816.312,Is it the case that the proviso allows for the Council to evaluate those salary Savings and either capturing savings or releasing them back to the Department based on Realtime operational needs.,168,,
679,0.97,3816.312,3840.903,Can you remind us of how restrictive or flexible the $5 million proviso is as it relates to this last minute issue that the executive is flagging that they may have a need for additional dollars beyond the projected 114 Ftes.,168,,
680,0.97,3840.903,3847.41,I will though you have done a pretty good job.,169,,
681,0.97,3847.41,3849.846,It is designed to be flexible.,169,,
682,0.97,3849.846,3867.363,It is designed to be evaluated on a monthly or quarterly basis and adjusted for real savings that comes from staffing plan or adjusted a different way if there is no savings from the staffing plan.,169,,
683,0.97,3867.363,3876.005,"Council would have opportunity as we move through time to look at the staffing plan, figure out what's happening, adjust that provides Oh accordingly.",169,,
684,0.97,3876.005,3887.416,"If everything went according to staffing plan and we Reacheddent of the year, that would be to be adjusted.",169,,
685,0.97,3887.416,3902.164,It has been a place holder for the Council to be able to hold and potentially reevaluate salary saving from his attrition or from not being able to hire enough.,169,,
686,0.97,3902.164,3906.035,"Yes, it was designed to be flexible.",169,,
687,0.97,3906.035,3927.823,"If it grabs 2.3 million from the 16 officers that could not be paid next year because they've left this year, then that 2.3 million, council could reevaluate next year to determine if they need to give it back to SPD for more hiring if hiring goes in excess or looks like it will go in excess of 114.",169,,
688,0.97,3927.823,3932.862,Hopefully that gets at everything you are asking.,169,,
689,0.97,3932.862,3938.234,It does.,170,,
690,0.97,3938.234,3939.969,I appreciate that.,170,,
691,0.97,3939.969,3950.746,Then just really--I will end my questions there but I may want to make additional remarks before the role is called.,170,,
692,0.97,3950.746,3951.814,"Thank you, Council President.",171,,
693,0.97,3951.814,3954.216,We'll come back to you.,171,,
694,0.97,3954.216,3960.856,"Councilmember Pedersen, did I see your hand up?",171,,
695,0.97,3960.856,3962.758,Councilmember Juarez I see you as well.,171,,
696,0.97,3962.758,3964.26,Thank you.,172,,
697,0.97,3964.26,3965.161,A quick follow up.,172,,
698,0.97,3965.161,3975.237,Thank you for the questions because that helps to provide additional context and potential flexibility.,172,,
699,0.97,3975.237,3978.808,So I can see the pros and cons of this particular amendment.,172,,
700,0.97,3978.808,3989.985,I am going to be voting no on this particular amendment because it is last minute and still trying to work through different questions and hearing different things from the executive on it.,172,,
701,0.97,3989.985,3995.424,Our central staff is doing the best they can to interpret things as quickly as possible.,172,,
702,0.97,3995.424,4002.131,So that gray area just gives me Trepidation when there are so many changes going on at once.,172,,
703,0.97,4002.131,4011.474,I support reinvesting tens of millions of dollars from SPD to other alternatives.,172,,
704,0.97,4011.474,4016.312,I am hoping that the done also when we revamp police Union contract.,172,,
705,0.97,4016.312,4023.519,I would like to save money there Inted of just reducing number of officers.,172,,
706,0.97,4023.519,4029.392,I would rather save in how their pay is structured and over time how that is allocated and things like that.,172,,
707,0.97,4029.392,4037.967,I look forward to the contract saving us money instead of just taking money away by Otherring number of officers until we have more information.,172,,
708,0.97,4037.967,4043.406,I understand there will be a deeper staffing analysis done next year.,172,,
709,0.97,4043.406,4048.477,We'll obviously have a community Participatory budgeting process.,172,,
710,0.97,4048.477,4051.047,The Mayor's task force as well.,172,,
711,0.97,4051.047,4055.151,More information in the middle of the next year I think will be very helpful for me.,172,,
712,0.97,4055.151,4061.724,Right now I will vote no on this one.,172,,
713,0.97,4061.724,4062.992,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",173,,
714,0.97,4062.992,4063.459,Councilmember Juarez.,173,,
715,0.97,4063.459,4063.859,Thank you.,174,,
716,0.97,4063.859,4076.072,I want to follow up on some questions I have and thank central staff for Eting this to us and be straightforward and candid.,174,,
717,0.97,4076.072,4092.822,"This late amendment in the last 72 hours, the late breaking news that in October we will have 16 additional Attritions, I want to be clear from what we are hearing and not have a repeat from over summer where people were taking a pledge without a plan.",174,,
718,0.97,4092.822,4101.197,Let me ask this Straightforwardly because of the E-Mails we got and some comments during public comment and honest in our message.,174,,
719,0.97,4101.197,4104.6,Is this a hiring freeze?,174,,
720,0.97,4104.6,4104.834,No.,175,,
721,0.97,4104.834,4109.171,This isn't a hiring freeze.,175,,
722,0.97,4109.171,4116.245,I would say that this does not impact the Department's ability to hire.,175,,
723,0.97,4116.245,4128.557,"I would say that if the Department was able to hire more than 114, it would impact their ability to go above their projected numbers.",175,,
724,0.97,4128.557,4142.371,So that is something that the Council would need to evaluate as to what they wanted to do regarding any savings that is available now from the additional attrition.,175,,
725,0.97,4142.371,4144.106,So that's important to note.,175,,
726,0.97,4144.106,4146.809,It is not a hiring freeze.,175,,
727,0.97,4146.809,4162.992,I think also important to note is that the Department could use this funding for over time to pay officers so they don't have to transfer officers to patrol.,175,,
728,0.97,4162.992,4181.51,That is something they can look at next year as working through the proviso to adjust or release from the savings from say the 23 or 16 that left in October and that savings will be available next year.,175,,
729,0.97,4181.51,4182.077,Okay.,176,,
730,0.97,4182.077,4183.045,Not a hiring freeze.,177,,
731,0.97,4183.045,4185.748,Two more to follow up.,178,,
732,0.97,4185.748,4201.83,"Again, some of this may seem simplistic but I just don't want people to get the wrong message about what we are doing, that we have this information and somehow we Flip- flopped.",178,,
733,0.97,4201.83,4204.333,I am not happy that it came in late.,178,,
734,0.97,4204.333,4206.368,I thought we wrapped up everything Thursday.,178,,
735,0.97,4206.368,4213.242,There has been a lot of Messaging back and forth from everywhere about what this means.,178,,
736,0.97,4213.242,4228.657,"My second question is if it's not a hiring freeze and we know that, is this a statement if we were to vote yes today that the Seattle city council is voting for no new police officers?",178,,
737,0.97,4228.657,4255.05,I don't think that's the case although I do have to note that if the Department is ..,179,,
738,0.97,4256.418,4259.388,And there would be money available to handle that.,179,,
739,0.97,4259.388,4281.977,Would we learn more of the impacts of how this affects taking police officers on particular specialized units and assigning them to patrol?,180,,
740,0.97,4281.977,4282.811,Say it again.,181,,
741,0.97,4282.811,4288.117,We've had question that Council is in control of the funding but not staffing.,182,,
742,0.97,4288.117,4292.488,Jump in if I am getting this wrong.,182,,
743,0.97,4292.488,4300.129,What I am getting at is the impact of what--it seems kind of backwards.,182,,
744,0.97,4300.129,4314.176,"If you are going to say we are not going to hire, then that puts stress on staffing on the police side of okay so if we are not going to be hiring, we are going to have to use the officers we have now.",182,,
745,0.97,4314.176,4320.716,"We are going to have to use them, reassign them to patrol maybe out of speciality units.",182,,
746,0.97,4320.716,4322.318,There will be no over time.,182,,
747,0.97,4322.318,4329.892,There are all the other effects we have been discussing all summer and all fall.,182,,
748,0.97,4329.892,4332.961,I am wondering are we going to have more information about that?,182,,
749,0.97,4332.961,4335.998,Can you tell me now based on your conversations?,182,,
750,0.97,4335.998,4345.841,I can tell you on the hiring side there are funds for the Department it achieve the current plan of 114.,183,,
751,0.97,4345.841,4346.141,Okay.,184,,
752,0.97,4346.141,4360.189,"If the Department comes next year and says we think we can do 130 and here is why, council would need to provide more funding for hiring.",185,,
753,0.97,4360.189,4365.761,I did send an E-mail to Councilmembers giving history of the hiring.,185,,
754,0.97,4365.761,4367.129,We are in unprecedented times.,185,,
755,0.97,4367.129,4371.266,They may be able to achieve a greater number of hires.,185,,
756,0.97,4371.266,4372.468,It's hard to say.,185,,
757,0.97,4372.468,4378.574,What they have told us is they could do 114 and this does not restrict their ability to do that.,185,,
758,0.97,4378.574,4397.393,I would say in terms of using over time to back fill so they don't have to use officers from investigative or speciality units taking of this money or any money from SPD would reduce their ability to do so.,185,,
759,0.97,4397.393,4397.693,Okay.,186,,
760,0.97,4397.693,4398.46,Thank you.,186,,
761,0.97,4398.46,4405.0,Also noting that additional question you mentioned before as well.,187,,
762,0.97,4405.0,4407.136,I don't see additional hands.,188,,
763,0.97,4407.136,4411.306,"Would you like to make comments, Councilment?",188,,
764,0.97,4411.306,4422.684,I think I saw Councilmember Sawant and I think Councilmember Juarez's line of questioning was very important.,189,,
765,0.97,4422.684,4466.495,"On the hiring freeze question in my conversations with the executive, and I did have opportunity to directly connect with the Mayor yesterday evening, I think there is unfortunately a little bit of perhaps Definitional struggle that there is question of hiring freeze meaning nobody ever gets hired again whether for back filling purposes or above and beyond the amount of full time equivalence that we have budgeted for.",189,,
766,0.97,4466.495,4485.781,So I hear the concern from the Mayor that they are worried that the budget action may limit the ability to back fill for positions that are funded that have not been Aggregated and that are vacated.,189,,
767,0.97,4485.781,4507.502,I just want to get an understanding from you and or Dan about whether there is anything in this proposed budget action that prohibits the Department from back filling positions.,189,,
768,0.97,4507.502,4525.754,"In other words, if positions are funded, if the position has not been Aggregated and it suddenly becomes vacant, does the Department still have the ability to fill, hire for that position?",189,,
769,0.97,4525.754,4531.86,"I think the answer to that is yes, they do.",190,,
770,0.97,4531.86,4541.203,"It's just a matter of when you say hire, you mean hire new officers or use over time to back fill?",190,,
771,0.97,4541.203,4542.738,I mean replace the body.,191,,
772,0.97,4542.738,4554.416,"In terms of over time for back fill, replacing the body in the short term, it's entirely dependent on how much funding they have for over time.",192,,
773,0.97,4554.416,4564.76,"If this funding is removed they would have less funding for over time to do this, to back fill for the bodies in patrol.",192,,
774,0.97,4564.76,4572.568,And they may be forced into a situation where they have to put officers into patrol to back fill.,192,,
775,0.97,4572.568,4584.346,"I think it's the case that so long as they have position authority it doesn't matter if an individual leaves the force, they have authority to hire another individual.",193,,
776,0.97,4584.346,4589.985,Of course it takes time to get through the Academy and all the training.,193,,
777,0.97,4589.985,4599.094,It takes a lot of time to get someone into a fully trained sworn officer position but they have the authority do so.,193,,
778,0.97,4599.094,4600.095,Isn't that correct?,193,,
779,0.97,4600.095,4600.329,Yes.,194,,
780,0.97,4600.329,4608.804,I think we have handled both aspects of Council President Gonzalez's questions.,194,,
781,0.97,4608.804,4621.617,"If I can add, I think being on the nose about it, budget action itself says it assumes there will be equal number of hires and separations, 114 a piece.",195,,
782,0.97,4621.617,4639.601,"That's sort of the assumption in the amendment as has been discussed today, there are a number of ways where you can talk about how the Department may achieve savings due to current attrition rates, future attrition rates, how successful they are at hiring.",195,,
783,0.97,4639.601,4667.129,"I think the decision is how much to authorize them to spend in 2021 right now knowing that the situation may change and you may want to change authorization in the future depending on circumstances and that can include capturing savings that would be achieved through Council President Gonzalez's proviso on $5 million, capturing savings through another proviso.",195,,
784,0.97,4667.129,4671.967,There are a lot of ways.,195,,
785,0.97,4671.967,4681.843,This action is changing how much Department is authorized to spend at the beginning of the year and may need to be reconsidered in the future.,195,,
786,0.97,4681.843,4683.211,Thank you.,196,,
787,0.97,4683.211,4683.679,I appreciate that.,196,,
788,0.97,4683.679,4698.093,Then there is sort of the question of if we wanted to hire more than 114 we wouldn't be able to hire more than 114.,196,,
789,0.97,4698.093,4705.467,To me that would be true no matter what we set the number at.,196,,
790,0.97,4705.467,4715.343,Our job is to in the context of the full revenue of the city to provide X number of dollars to SPD.,196,,
791,0.97,4715.343,4716.912,It is all discretionary funding.,196,,
792,0.97,4716.912,4730.559,"They might be able to hire 114 officers, could be the case they wanted to hire 50 next year and they think they might be able to do 60.",196,,
793,0.97,4730.559,4754.182,The fact that we are funding them for a total number of positions certainly I think can be characterized as a cap meaning a maximum but that's different than characterizing the total appropriation as a hiring freeze.,196,,
794,0.97,4754.182,4755.751,Is that fair?,196,,
795,0.97,4755.751,4757.052,I think it's fundamentally fair.,197,,
796,0.97,4757.052,4777.773,"It sort of goes back to the comments I made at the start of the presentation which is the Council doesn't appropriate a staffing plan and Council doesn't appropriate positions, doesn't appropriate a staffing plan.",197,,
797,0.97,4777.773,4788.984,It's a dollar amount based on what SPD thinks it can do in terms of hires and what SPD thinks will happen in terms of separations.,197,,
798,0.97,4788.984,4795.357,We had heard from SPD at the point in time of the budget that they thought they could only hire 114.,197,,
799,0.97,4795.357,4802.13,So that is all the Mayor funded in her proposed budget was the hiring of 114.,197,,
800,0.97,4802.13,4812.007,So the Council is not taking any action that is inconsistent with the proposed budget on the hiring side.,197,,
801,0.97,4812.007,4831.927,"I think it is true if this recent information from the executive that they can hire more, that's something that is not contemplated in proposed budget and that's something that the Council would have had to take action on next year.",197,,
802,0.97,4831.927,4846.308,So I think it is the case that Council should think about not a hiring plan but does SPD have enough money to do what it is projecting to do in are proposed budget on the hiring side.,197,,
803,0.97,4846.308,4852.48,It is the same as what Council would be adopting with this amendment.,197,,
804,0.97,4852.48,4856.351,It would not change the funding available for 114.,197,,
805,0.97,4856.351,4860.155,Got it.,198,,
806,0.97,4860.155,4872.033,So to sort of summarize that the Mayor's proposed 2021 budget included funding for 114 new hires at the Seattle police Department.,198,,
807,0.97,4872.033,4887.382,The budget we are considering now does not restrict the Mayor from pursuing on behalf of SPD that staff of 114 new hires.,198,,
808,0.97,4887.382,4928.456,What this action does however is it modifies the projected amount of attrition that we believe will actually occur in 2021 which is different than what SPD has estimated in a point in time proposal in its 2021 proposed budget meaning we estimate there will be 114 separations in 2021 as opposed to the 89 separations that SPD has forecasted would occur in 2021.,198,,
809,0.97,4928.456,4950.845,So we are front loading potential savings as a result of that modulated estimate is my understanding of sort of that essential--is my understanding accurate?,198,,
810,0.97,4950.845,4951.212,"Yes, 100%.",199,,
811,0.97,4951.212,4956.418,So again we are not touching at all the hiring side of the equation.,200,,
812,0.97,4956.418,4984.512,We are simply saying we think based on all the data we now have through the end of October related to separations that it is reasonable for Council to modify the number of forecasted separations for 2021 and to do that now to capture Savings and Prioritize dollars for community safety projects.,200,,
813,0.97,4984.512,4987.482,That's my understanding of what this amendment does.,201,,
814,0.97,4987.482,4988.35,Thank you.,202,,
815,0.97,4988.35,4993.088,Thank you very much.,203,,
816,0.97,4993.088,4994.723,I believe I saw Councilmember Sawant.,203,,
817,0.97,4994.723,5000.929,"If I saw another hand, remind me.",203,,
818,0.97,5000.929,5001.629,I am sorry.,204,,
819,0.97,5001.629,5005.333,I need one more second.,204,,
820,0.97,5005.333,5006.001,No problem.,205,,
821,0.97,5006.001,5015.71,"Councilmember Herbold, would you like to go ahead?",205,,
822,0.97,5015.71,5018.113,Sure.,206,,
823,0.97,5018.113,5036.331,"I want to also highlight information we have received from the budget office and for the folks who haven't had a chance to see it, I want to give Greg a chance to respond.",206,,
824,0.97,5036.331,5056.985,I do want to say the fact that we are anticipating 114 Attritions seems a little cute to me to be honest given that the number in the staffing plan for the hires is 114.,206,,
825,0.97,5056.985,5072.367,It just feels like it is an attempt to respond to the call for no new net officers.,206,,
826,0.97,5072.367,5073.368,It confuses.,206,,
827,0.97,5073.368,5076.971,I appreciate the line of questioning to be clear of what it is we are actually doing.,206,,
828,0.97,5076.971,5079.741,We are not doing a hiring freeze.,206,,
829,0.97,5079.741,5122.117,"We are not taking a budget action that will in itself result in no net officers . But to the point as it relates to the next Iteration of what we should expect not on the attrition side but the hire side, we were notified by the executive over the weekend that they have a large number of Preapproved hires that are ready to move into the Academy next year.",206,,
830,0.97,5122.117,5128.423,Apparently the forecast for January is 11.,206,,
831,0.97,5128.423,5129.457,February is 12.,206,,
832,0.97,5129.457,5132.327,For March is 11.,206,,
833,0.97,5132.327,5137.999,"After that, forecast assumes seven per month.",206,,
834,0.97,5137.999,5158.219,This was provided as information from the executive arguing they think they can hire more than 114 in 2021 despite the fact that over seven years that Greg provided they've never been able to hire more than 108.,206,,
835,0.97,5158.219,5160.421,"Two questions, Greg.",206,,
836,0.97,5160.421,5180.808,"Can you just talk a little bit about why the staffing plan isn't only a function of dollars, that the projections of how many people can be hired isn't just about funds that the Council provides.",206,,
837,0.97,5180.808,5194.155,"It's about some past years' information about applications, eligibility, spots in the Academy, people who finish, who graduate, finish training, etc.",206,,
838,0.97,5194.155,5214.275,"Secondly, can you let us know whether or not the numbers I just mentioned for Preapproved hires are included in the 114 hire projection that SPD previously provided?",206,,
839,0.97,5214.275,5214.509,Thanks.,206,,
840,0.97,5214.509,5214.809,Thanks.,207,,
841,0.97,5214.809,5221.516,"To your second question first, the numbers you just read are numbers from the October staffing plan.",207,,
842,0.97,5221.516,5225.486,Those are numbers that are part of the 114.,207,,
843,0.97,5225.486,5240.234,"If there are additional folks waiting in the wings, I have not been notified that there are additional folks waiting in the wings beyond that.",207,,
844,0.97,5240.234,5241.703,At least not formally.,207,,
845,0.97,5241.703,5251.813,"To my knowledge at this point in time, the numbers that you read are what we know about.",207,,
846,0.97,5251.813,5262.523,"To your first question, there are lots of limitations on SPD's ability to hire new officers.",207,,
847,0.97,5262.523,5267.662,There is a background process that is extensive.,207,,
848,0.97,5267.662,5276.971,"The department has to, with any number of new recruits coming in, spend a lot of time Backgrounding officers before they can be hired.",207,,
849,0.97,5276.971,5282.377,There are oral boards they need to get through.,207,,
850,0.97,5282.377,5298.86,"So those are time constraints on the Department because officers, existing officers or detectives are used to do the background checks and are needed for the oral boards.",207,,
851,0.97,5298.86,5301.029,There are some research Limitatins on that side.,207,,
852,0.97,5301.029,5306.1,There is a limitation on the number of folks that can go to the Academy.,207,,
853,0.97,5306.1,5311.706,Right now Seattle has a contract that allows for seven per month.,207,,
854,0.97,5311.706,5322.116,If there are additional spots available in the Academy because other agencies are not sending their share then it is potential that SPD can send more.,207,,
855,0.97,5322.116,5339.3,"I believe that with the additional folks that they have coming in in the first quarter, the 12 and 11 that you mentioned, they are hoping to do a Seattle only Academy and they're working with the criminal justice training Commission to do that.",207,,
856,0.97,5339.3,5344.272,That's not something that I know anything more than what I just said.,207,,
857,0.97,5344.272,5353.548,"I guess I am giving you a lot of information to say yes, there are other limitations for their ability to hire.",207,,
858,0.97,5353.548,5358.086,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold for that as well.",208,,
859,0.97,5358.086,5359.52,"Councilmember Sawant, I believe you are next.",208,,
860,0.97,5359.52,5362.79,Then I think we are ready to wrap it up.,208,,
861,0.97,5362.79,5366.427,I don't see additional hands.,208,,
862,0.97,5366.427,5366.994,Thank you.,209,,
863,0.97,5366.994,5368.896,I had final comments.,209,,
864,0.97,5368.896,5370.164,I don't have questions.,209,,
865,0.97,5370.164,5372.834,"If Council members have questions, I should come after them.",209,,
866,0.97,5372.834,5383.945,"I don't see additional questions, Councilmember Sawant.",210,,
867,0.97,5383.945,5384.212,Okay.,211,,
868,0.97,5384.212,5385.513,Thank you.,211,,
869,0.97,5385.513,5413.408,"As the Councilmember who brought the amendments for 50% Defund of the police and the $9 million reduction in the police budget for no new cops, I am of course need less to say voting yes on this budget amendment to cut 2 million from the loaded police budget, to instead put the funds in community led safety initiatives.",211,,
870,0.97,5413.408,5420.515,I think $2 million for community programs and for needs of marginalized people in our city is extremely important.,211,,
871,0.97,5420.515,5428.756,Obviously this is not the 50% Defund which was a key demand of the justice for George Floyd movement nationwide.,211,,
872,0.97,5428.756,5440.701,"That would require Council at this point given all the changes to reduce police budget by $150 million and when I moved that for a vote last week, no other Councilmember would even second the motion.",211,,
873,0.97,5440.701,5454.549,This $2 million is not even SPD officer hiring freeze that thousands of community members wrote to the city Council to demand over the last two weeks.,211,,
874,0.97,5454.549,5461.789,That would require cutting $9.05 million and when I moved that last Thursday only Councilmember Morales joined me in voting yes.,211,,
875,0.97,5461.789,5473.167,"As I mentioned last week, every reduction in the bloated police budget reflects real tangible victory for the movement that is actually very rare.",211,,
876,0.97,5473.167,5476.704,Police spending is almost never reduced under capitalism.,211,,
877,0.97,5476.704,5493.788,"This year it has happened in small ways several times and it is entirely because of the strength of the black lives matter movement in Seattle, tens of thousands of ordinary people joining in multi racial unity against police violence and repression.",211,,
878,0.97,5493.788,5510.605,Additionally in Seattle it has been because of the movement having its own unwavering and consistent voice through Socialist Council office and the people's budget movement which has stood steadfast with solid piece dare budget on the Police-Related demands.,211,,
879,0.97,5510.605,5518.312,First Mayor proposed reducing police budget by $18.4 million in real terms not including the accounting tricks.,211,,
880,0.97,5518.312,5523.918,Last week city council reduced police budget by $10.7 million.,211,,
881,0.97,5523.918,5550.845,Finally because of the outrage and disappointment last week over refusal of most Democrats to support even the SPD hiring freeze amendment from my office which would have cut $9 million there is an additional $2 million being directed to community needs.,211,,
882,0.97,5550.845,5553.948,82.2% of the police budget.,211,,
883,0.97,5553.948,5574.068,Some community organizers and also Democratic Council members used the figure of 17% or nearly 20% as the reductions in police budget but we have to note that figure includes things like transferring parking enforcement costs out of the police budget which is not any substantive change in practice of policing.,211,,
884,0.97,5574.068,5579.807,I think 8.2% is the most accurate measure of what has been achieved.,211,,
885,0.97,5579.807,5616.61,That reduction in the police budget is a real achievement of the movement and we need to celebrate that while we have to continue to fight for what is needed which is Defunding police by 50% because it is public revenues going to repress Civ policing and instead putting funds to community programs for affordable housing for social services which is something that we have broad agreement on in Seattle and for an elected community oversight board with real powers over the police which is another thing not a single Democrat on the Council was willing to support my office and people's budget on.,211,,
886,0.97,5616.61,5624.251,Not only will all of that reduce repress Civ policing but will allow expansion of the program.,211,,
887,0.97,5624.251,5628.389,Statistics will tell you have a far greater impact even on crime.,211,,
888,0.97,5628.389,5646.073,Our movement should not be naive and believe this budget amendment for $2 million came this morning because police Coincidently happened over the weekend to change forecast of how many officers will quit or hire next year or because new data about attrition has been acquired.,211,,
889,0.97,5646.073,5656.851,"Even though there may be new data on attrition, our movement has to be clear that based on assumptions about SPD staffing in 2021.",211,,
890,0.97,5656.851,5663.958,Fundamentally we need to understand that some new data is not the reason to are this $2 million reduction in police budget.,211,,
891,0.97,5663.958,5677.738,The only reason this is happening is because my office brought in every demand from the movement from 50% to $9 million.,211,,
892,0.97,5677.738,5678.506,Democrats opposed every proposal.,211,,
893,0.97,5678.506,5687.748,Because of that there has been justifiable anger and discuss at the establishment over the weekend from thousands of ordinary people who have been committed to black lives matter.,211,,
894,0.97,5687.748,5699.393,This anger is what has meant that the Democratic Council members needed to save face with the movement by betraying promises to Defund and even refusing to support no new cops.,211,,
895,0.97,5699.393,5704.565,The hope on the Democrats' part is this additional $2 million will Placate the movement.,211,,
896,0.97,5704.565,5741.836,"Months in Federal message is we absolutely should celebrate winning this 2 million and understand that it was because of our mobilizing and organizing that we are winning but refuse to be placated until we window hands that we have been calling for and continue the fight into next year and combine the fight for the end to police violence and for police accountability to need to cancel rent and mortgage, utility pavements this Covid for massive Covid relief and guaranteed jobs program with a green new deal.",211,,
897,0.97,5741.836,5742.136,Thank you.,211,,
898,0.97,5742.136,5742.503,Council.,212,,
899,0.97,5742.503,5743.037,Gonzalez is next.,212,,
900,0.97,5743.037,5747.475,I want to note that quite literally the data did come on Friday.,212,,
901,0.97,5747.475,5762.356,That's important for us to make sure that we are reflecting that data.,212,,
902,0.97,5762.356,5764.959,Council President Gonzalez.,212,,
903,0.97,5764.959,5765.493,No problem.,212,,
904,0.97,5765.493,5769.463,It's realities of working from home.,212,,
905,0.97,5769.463,5774.001,I had an infant dangling from my legs for a moment.,212,,
906,0.97,5774.001,5783.844,Thank you chair Mosqueda for opportunity to make some closing remarks.,212,,
907,0.97,5783.844,5809.937,"I have struggled with this amendment all weekend, have worked hard to get as much information as I can from the sponsor and from Council central staff and also from engagement directly with the Mayor and with her senior staff as well.",212,,
908,0.97,5809.937,5824.151,"You know, ultimately, I am going to support this particular proposal but I want to explain why I am supporting this proposal.",212,,
909,0.97,5824.151,5854.348,I also want to acknowledge that I am disappointed that this proposal was made in the 11th hour and that it was given to us after it was suggested a no additional policy amendments.,212,,
910,0.97,5854.348,5858.452,I want to Diswade us from engaging in this behavior.,212,,
911,0.97,5858.452,5879.006,I think we are better served and constituents are better served with meaningful policy conversations during the allocated process to have strong debate around the really important policy issues.,212,,
912,0.97,5879.006,5888.215,I have dedicated a significant amount of time over the weekend to dig into this to be sure I understand what the proposal is and what the impact is.,212,,
913,0.97,5888.215,5893.02,That doesn't impact concerns about how this proposal came to be.,212,,
914,0.97,5893.02,5898.125,So I want to express my concerns related to that particular aspect.,212,,
915,0.97,5898.125,5907.968,This proposal in my mind captures savings we expect to be achieved from revised SPD staffing plan in 2021.,212,,
916,0.97,5907.968,5916.911,This revised staffing model anticipates about 114 officers leaving Seattle police Department in 2021 coupled with a plan to hire 114 new recruits.,212,,
917,0.97,5916.911,5919.213,This plan is just a forecast.,212,,
918,0.97,5919.213,5927.488,It is constantly evolving and reality often departs from the predictions.,212,,
919,0.97,5927.488,5932.293,Based on trends I suspect that the update to the forecast is likely fair and appropriate.,212,,
920,0.97,5932.293,5943.304,I believe it will bear out that in 2021 departures from force will continue at increased rate above what was forecasted by SPD in the proposed budget.,212,,
921,0.97,5943.304,5964.191,As a result we will need to Revisit my $5 million proviso that is included in this budget in 2021 to determine whether or not it would be more appropriate based on Realtime information to provide the dollars back to SPD or to continue to capture labor savings for community investments.,212,,
922,0.97,5964.191,5980.741,I view this amendment as Transactional in nature similar to other budget actions I sponsor to redirect savings from SPD staffing plan to building at earn touch system that truly assures all safety will be protected.,212,,
923,0.97,5980.741,5988.949,Like my previously adopted budget proposals this would capture and reinvest anticipated savings from Spd2021 staffing plan.,212,,
924,0.97,5988.949,6006.1,"While the revised staffing plan anticipates a net zero change to the size of the force with 114 departures and 114 hires, it does not restrict SPD's ability and authority to bring in New recruits they anticipate hiring next year.",212,,
925,0.97,6006.1,6009.503,That number is 114 as proposed by the Mayor.,212,,
926,0.97,6009.503,6021.248,Today this morning is the first time we have heard that the Mayor and SPD believe that they may be able to hire more than 114 new recruits.,212,,
927,0.97,6021.248,6028.989,"However, her budget did not propose 114, more than 114 new hires to begin with.",212,,
928,0.97,6028.989,6034.261,"To the clear, this is not a hiring freeze.",212,,
929,0.97,6034.261,6049.476,"If executive wants to hire beyond their current plan even as proposed by her in the 2021 proposed budget, she will need to come to the Council and explain and justify that position to the city council.",212,,
930,0.97,6049.476,6055.649,A lot has been made about majority of Council voting against proposed hiring freeze last week.,212,,
931,0.97,6055.649,6063.957,I want to share how I believe we are still on the course to right size the force without adopting a hiring freeze strategy.,212,,
932,0.97,6063.957,6077.671,"To start, here in Seattle, we are meaningfully advancing work sparked in cities across the country in response to the black lives married protest stemming from murder of George Floyd.",212,,
933,0.97,6077.671,6083.544,Many cities discussed divesting and many efforts have collapsed under the weight of the effort.,212,,
934,0.97,6083.544,6098.158,"These institutions have created by design road blocks, barriers, hurdles to any efforts to reform or dismantle problems with policing we can all see that creates trauma in community.",212,,
935,0.97,6098.158,6103.464,Cities and communities have been sidelined by defenses built into institution of policing.,212,,
936,0.97,6103.464,6122.182,"We here in Seattle are one of the few cities in America that is still in active pursuit of reforming our public safety model, achieving divestment from Militarized police Department, reinvesting the dollars in communities in a civilian led public safety system.",212,,
937,0.97,6122.182,6135.896,As I articulated last Thursday my concerns about proposed hiring freeze are related to the fact that sworn projected departures and hiring figures witnessed in recent years.,212,,
938,0.97,6135.896,6140.334,New data shared Friday reinforces how this is accelerating for the second month.,212,,
939,0.97,6140.334,6146.64,Separations are again way above projections with 23 departures verses the seven that SPD forecasted.,212,,
940,0.97,6146.64,6153.814,In the first ten months of 2020Spd forecasted 80 departures but we have seen 134.,212,,
941,0.97,6153.814,6160.854,This is increase of 54 separations before SPD's forecast and there are still two months left in the year.,212,,
942,0.97,6160.854,6176.37,So I am and remain concerned that any kind of hiring freeze would result in unsustainable reduction of the force that would prevent the city from responding to critical public safety needs before alternative systems are in place.,212,,
943,0.97,6176.37,6184.344,Unfortunate reality is undoing the systems even though they're rooted in deeply oppressive origins cannot be achieved overnight.,212,,
944,0.97,6184.344,6203.564,We need time and run way to drastically expand alternative emergency response systems that can Adaptly protect life and safety of those that currently rely on public safety systems as a response to the crisis they may be witnessing or experiencing.,212,,
945,0.97,6203.564,6206.033,I believe that we have much work left to do.,212,,
946,0.97,6206.033,6207.467,This is the beginning.,212,,
947,0.97,6207.467,6238.198,"Again, I view this proposal as consistent with the Council budget actions that I have sponsored that are part of the Rebalanced package, namely the $6.1 million reduction to the staffing plan given the additional information we just received related to departures and hires in October, I think it is reason a be to Bake those into this particular proposal.",212,,
948,0.97,6238.198,6256.883,Again colleagues I want to remind us that the $5 million proviso included here may not produce the savings if the numbers continue in the direction they are Trending.,212,,
949,0.97,6256.883,6257.484,Thank you chair.,212,,
950,0.97,6257.484,6257.951,Thank you.,213,,
951,0.97,6257.951,6266.46,Is there anybody else who would like to make comments?,213,,
952,0.97,6266.46,6266.96,Councilmember Morales.,213,,
953,0.97,6266.96,6267.327,Thank you.,214,,
954,0.97,6267.327,6285.679,I appreciate this discussion and I want to say I think the amendment acknowledges that we should be decreasing funding for the number of sworn officers next year.,214,,
955,0.97,6285.679,6288.482,"As Greg mentioned, we appropriate dollar amount.",214,,
956,0.97,6288.482,6289.049,We don't decide staffing.,214,,
957,0.97,6289.049,6291.485,I want to be clear that I understand that.,214,,
958,0.97,6291.485,6305.699,These kinds of questions have been on the table all summer because we are concerned about how the plan is put together and what it means for neighbors impacted.,214,,
959,0.97,6305.699,6322.115,I think the fact that this morning we got yet another version of what the staffing plan may be is an indication that we need to stay on top of how the plans are created.,214,,
960,0.97,6322.115,6327.354,"According to SPD's data, they spend 97% of the time responding to calls.",214,,
961,0.97,6327.354,6330.19,Over half are for noncriminal events.,214,,
962,0.97,6330.19,6337.931,If priority one calls SPD responded to in 2019 only about 11% were for criminal events.,214,,
963,0.97,6337.931,6346.373,"2% for assault, 4% for Trespassing, 3% for shop lifting, another 2% from other kinds of theft.",214,,
964,0.97,6346.373,6349.81,These are things considered criminal that they're responding to.,214,,
965,0.97,6349.81,6352.012,This analysis is provided by SPD.,214,,
966,0.97,6352.012,6369.629,So it begs the question for me why are we moving so many officers off of their assignments in detective units for example where they might be doing important investigative work into patrol and 911 response and protest suppression.,214,,
967,0.97,6369.629,6380.373,For me the real question is when will we as a society reject the premise that more officers equals more safety?,214,,
968,0.97,6380.373,6393.42,We can debate staffing models and training reforms and weapons selection but the truth of the matter is there is no Techno Consideratic fix to aggressive policing.,214,,
969,0.97,6393.42,6399.459,"Instead of investing in New police staffing, we need to use precious government resources to reduce inequality.",214,,
970,0.97,6399.459,6404.398,That is what leads to the kind of community conditions that are troubling society.,214,,
971,0.97,6404.398,6409.302,That's the kind of thing that causes people to call 911.,214,,
972,0.97,6409.302,6417.177,Resources for 25 net new officers should go instead to improving community conditions.,214,,
973,0.97,6417.177,6429.823,"I want to just end by quoting the book ""end of policing ."" I have been reading it a lot lately, I will admit.",214,,
974,0.97,6429.823,6438.431,"The current system subsidizes inequality, Criminalizes those it leaves behind, especially when they demand something better.",214,,
975,0.97,6438.431,6450.577,"Yes, communities deserve protection from crime and even from disorder but we must always demand those without reliance on the coercion, guard our criminal justice der system.",214,,
976,0.97,6450.577,6456.349,I am going to support this amendment and I want to say that we have a lot more work to do.,214,,
977,0.97,6456.349,6473.133,I am committed to doing that work in collaboration with my colleagues and with Stakeholders who have have been pushing us on the commitments we have made and I look forward to continuing this work with you.,214,,
978,0.97,6473.133,6479.072,Thank you very much.,215,,
979,0.97,6479.072,6480.874,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",215,,
980,0.97,6480.874,6481.608,Thank you.,216,,
981,0.97,6481.608,6490.75,"Just partially in response to some of the comments that have come before, I wanted to say a couple more things here.",216,,
982,0.97,6490.75,6491.084,Sorry.,216,,
983,0.97,6491.084,6501.394,Not only is this not a hiring freeze because the projections that we are looking at include hiring.,216,,
984,0.97,6501.394,6510.503,There has also been a call for this concept of no new net hires as distinct from hiring freeze.,216,,
985,0.97,6510.503,6519.179,"Hiring freeze in my mind means we would not recruit, take applications, send people to the Academy, have them go through training.",216,,
986,0.97,6519.179,6525.585,This budget assumes that there is going to be hiring happening.,216,,
987,0.97,6525.585,6534.094,I don't think it is either a budget action that in itself will result in no new net hires as some have called for.,216,,
988,0.97,6534.094,6547.407,"Instead it is a budget action that reflects reality that given the police Department staffing plan, it would not likely be possible for SPD to make new hires in 2021.",216,,
989,0.97,6547.407,6558.318,"Budget action is based on, is an adjustment based on staffing plan given most recent numbers for attrition.",216,,
990,0.97,6558.318,6572.365,"From central staff, the quote in the description of the amendment is that the staffing plan can no longer reach a total of 1,357 full time equivalents.",216,,
991,0.97,6572.365,6579.673,"We're using the term, I think, staffing plan a little bit Interchangeably with how it's been traditionally used.",216,,
992,0.97,6579.673,6589.649,I first want to say this Council has embraced the understanding that more officers do not equal more safety.,216,,
993,0.97,6589.649,6628.054,"Our staffing plan is based not on a number of officers that we have done a work load analysis to determine how much work we want SPD officers to be doing and how many hours it takes to do, our staffing plan right now is merely based on the number of hires SPD believes it can do next year which is a significant reduction from the previous years' staffing plans.",216,,
994,0.97,6628.054,6637.764,The previous year's staffing plan was based not just on hiring to fill for Attritions but it was based on this concept of growing the size of the police Department.,216,,
995,0.97,6637.764,6645.639,We are not on the trajectory anymore.,216,,
996,0.97,6645.639,6664.624,We haven't done the analysis Necessay for over my years of working at the city Council to determine what are Stafferring plans should be and the staffing plans as it should be is not based on the number of officers that it is possible to hire.,216,,
997,0.97,6664.624,6671.164,It's based on the number of officers that we want to hire.,216,,
998,0.97,6671.164,6693.086,"We cannot do that work without new inputs for the work load of officers and those new inputs for work load of officers, if we want that to look differently, if we want that to be a smaller number of officers, it has to be based on officers doing less work.",216,,
999,0.97,6693.086,6701.194,Officers aren't going to be doing less work unless we have other people doing the work.,216,,
1000,0.97,6701.194,6711.538,I think that is an exercise that we need to engage in next year so that we can build off of what we have done this year.,216,,
1001,0.97,6711.538,6748.441,"Again, our ability to do so is really linked to our ability to both not only find the dollars from the SPD budget and other budget adjustments we wait to support these new public safety response systems but that those systems have to not only be contracted to do the work but they actually have to be supported by the city in creating that new infrastructure to replace some of the work that police are doing.",216,,
1002,0.97,6748.441,6761.488,"Then we have to do analysis of how many numbers of hours of what is traditionally police Department work, these new response efforts are doing.",216,,
1003,0.97,6761.488,6763.79,We haven't done that yet.,216,,
1004,0.97,6763.79,6766.86,I just really want to emphasize that that is work to be done.,216,,
1005,0.97,6766.86,6795.655,"To do it with this budget . On Lastly, I am sure I will get a lot of flak for this, but I know we have talked a lot and not enough about the harm that many, many people have experienced at the hands of police for centuries across the nation and here in Seattle.",216,,
1006,0.97,6795.655,6805.598,Our work to shift the public safety response away from the police is to begin to address our nation's shame in the history of policing.,216,,
1007,0.97,6805.598,6811.871,"Harm at the hands of police has been most experienced by black men, women, and children.",216,,
1008,0.97,6811.871,6829.355,"But I just want to share a little bit with the listening public in response to some of the testimony that I have heard today and in the past that police don't stop crime, they only arrive after.",216,,
1009,0.97,6829.355,6844.737,"Last Monday in my district in South Park, police officers responded to an assault between people who live unsheltered, live in their Rvs in South park.",216,,
1010,0.97,6844.737,6854.08,The victim had kerosene poured on him and the suspect tried to Ústab the victim with a large fixed blade knife.,216,,
1011,0.97,6854.08,6861.487,Officers arrived at the scene and took the suspect into custody.,216,,
1012,0.97,6861.487,6864.457,And that is one example.,216,,
1013,0.97,6864.457,6879.339,"I heard another a couple weeks ago in Pioneer square, police arrived at a time when a woman was being assaulted and interrupted the assault.",216,,
1014,0.97,6879.339,6895.989,"I want to say that police do stop crime, but they also have done a lot of harm to our communities.",216,,
1015,0.97,6895.989,6906.199,"We are trying to wrestle with, I think, something that is in some ways a calculation that we can't make on paper.",216,,
1016,0.97,6906.199,6923.549,How do we shift in investment in a system that has done harm but that has also stopped crime?,216,,
1017,0.97,6923.549,6937.397,How do you make that calculation within the context of this criminal justice reckoning that we're in the midst of.,216,,
1018,0.97,6937.397,6943.069,I think to that I say we just have to commit to doing the work and continuing to do the work.,216,,
1019,0.97,6943.069,6945.872,We are not at the end.,216,,
1020,0.97,6945.872,6948.374,We are at the beginning.,216,,
1021,0.97,6948.374,6963.656,"Our goal, I don't think it is about what the gold number of police officers is in the moment.",216,,
1022,0.97,6963.656,6986.646,It's about shifting what our vision of public safety is into the hands of Community-Based responses in those instances where those kinds of responses not only reduce harm but can deliver community safety in a way that police officers sometimes cannot.,216,,
1023,0.97,6986.646,6998.858,I just wanted to share that example of something that happened in South Park last Monday.,216,,
1024,0.97,6998.858,7034.26,"Again, it's a hard thing to weigh this question of help in some instances and harm in others but I am committed to continuing to weighing those realities as well as the investments and policy changes within that Matrics.",216,,
1025,0.97,7034.26,7034.794,Thank you.,217,,
1026,0.97,7034.794,7039.565,We flow that this conversation continues.,218,,
1027,0.97,7039.565,7045.705,I wanted to wrap this up and get us to a vote and I recognize the Lateness of the amendment.,218,,
1028,0.97,7045.705,7052.378,I do hope folks know as soon as we were able to get the data we worked with central staff to be sure this was available as soon as possible.,218,,
1029,0.97,7052.378,7059.519,I know there is a lot of folks who spent a lot of time over the weekend on this.,218,,
1030,0.97,7059.519,7072.865,Thanks to my colleagues for your questions today and process you put in place to anyone lies the amendment and thanks to my staff and central staff to be sure that we had all the information available to reflect in our budget.,218,,
1031,0.97,7072.865,7097.39,"I think if we hadn't reflected this, it would be out of alignment with what we have tried to accomplish through many of the Council members' existing proposals especially Councilmember's Gonzalez's and extending statements into the budget to be sure we were reflecting all the known vacancies so we could really continue to invest in Community- led solutions.",218,,
1032,0.97,7097.39,7099.926,Councilmember Juarez did you have something else before a vote?,218,,
1033,0.97,7099.926,7100.393,Yes.,219,,
1034,0.97,7100.393,7101.994,"I will be very, very brief.",219,,
1035,0.97,7101.994,7109.068,I first want to thank you Madam chair.,219,,
1036,0.97,7109.068,7109.836,"First, it was annoying.",219,,
1037,0.97,7109.836,7112.839,But the last 72 hours trying to get up to speed.,219,,
1038,0.97,7112.839,7117.743,Thank you central staff for late night memos.,219,,
1039,0.97,7117.743,7122.148,Thank you Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Gonzalez for helping me out and filling in information.,219,,
1040,0.97,7122.148,7125.618,I want to end on a different note.,219,,
1041,0.97,7125.618,7129.055,I will put on the elder hat for a moment.,219,,
1042,0.97,7129.055,7161.821,Hopefully we can start healing and moving forward in the city as we are in the country . I was going through my notes last night from June until now and everything we have dealt with.,219,,
1043,0.97,7161.821,7173.699,I think we have grown a lot as a city to understand how we Reimagine police force but also make sure that we have public safety in place.,219,,
1044,0.97,7173.699,7181.24,What I was saying is again black lives matter is powerful and profound.,219,,
1045,0.97,7181.24,7181.674,It's not a slogan.,219,,
1046,0.97,7181.674,7193.352,It does speak to the truth and the history and our lack of humanity not only to African Americans but people of color.,219,,
1047,0.97,7193.352,7205.031,"I just want to say to the folks out there, when you stand up and do your territorial pledge to the indigenous people, it isn't just words.",219,,
1048,0.97,7205.031,7205.965,It's actions.,219,,
1049,0.97,7205.965,7208.1,It's how you behave.,219,,
1050,0.97,7208.1,7211.837,"It's how you respect people, how you see humanity in other people.",219,,
1051,0.97,7211.837,7218.077,"When you say I want to acknowledge on indigenous land, that means you behave as a guest and you listen.",219,,
1052,0.97,7218.077,7231.123,I will say this and kind of follow the footsteps of Councilmember Herbold when she said I may take slack for this and I am beyond taking slack because I have gotten other stuff by this as well.,219,,
1053,0.97,7231.123,7236.862,"Defund police by 50% was a slogan, an empty misleading slogan.",219,,
1054,0.97,7236.862,7239.832,It caused damage.,219,,
1055,0.97,7239.832,7241.367,It caused pain.,219,,
1056,0.97,7241.367,7242.034,It caused trauma.,219,,
1057,0.97,7242.034,7244.537,It caused anger.,219,,
1058,0.97,7244.537,7252.612,But I understand Aspirational emotional feeling of why some of my colleagues felt the need to do that.,219,,
1059,0.97,7252.612,7254.513,I have done that before.,219,,
1060,0.97,7254.513,7260.386,"I am saying moving forward, can we start using the words about how we change, not how we fight?",219,,
1061,0.97,7260.386,7267.893,"Can we start using the language that we see each other, that it isn't about calling out people, about saving face?",219,,
1062,0.97,7267.893,7275.768,"Can we start to see humanity in each other in our city, in our country, and start healing?",219,,
1063,0.97,7275.768,7279.705,"When we talk about the police, it is about redirecting funds.",219,,
1064,0.97,7279.705,7298.19,"I want to thank all of you and particularly you Councilmember Mosqueda which you and I have talked about, and I believe Councilmember Herbold brought this up and Councilmember Gonzalez, we have reduced I believe about 20% of the police budget in under six months.",219,,
1065,0.97,7298.19,7300.526,I don't think any other city has done that.,219,,
1066,0.97,7300.526,7305.398,We should step back for a moment and Sayoc we have done that.,219,,
1067,0.97,7305.398,7308.601,Now how do we go forward?,219,,
1068,0.97,7308.601,7310.703,I like what Councilmember Gonzalez said.,219,,
1069,0.97,7310.703,7319.111,"When you undo the type of racist institutions, take it from me, that's been around for a long time, it doesn't happen overnight.",219,,
1070,0.97,7319.111,7321.914,It doesn't happen because you have a chant in a T-shirt.,219,,
1071,0.97,7321.914,7323.315,It's being in the trenches.,219,,
1072,0.97,7323.315,7334.493,"Some of us have been there for a long time in the trenches moving forward, marching towards a plan to do right by everybody.",219,,
1073,0.97,7334.493,7354.146,"When Councilmember Gonzalez talked about we need to address systemic layers of institutional racism, the barriers, the processes and everything that has kept us from having the kind of community policing that we need for equity, that's what our charge is right now going forward.",219,,
1074,0.97,7354.146,7368.294,"So when we talk about dismantling, we have to dismantle and replace with process and procedures that promote equity and humanity and recognition that true community safety belongs to all of us.",219,,
1075,0.97,7368.294,7375.267,The us and them has got to stop.,219,,
1076,0.97,7375.267,7381.173,We know that a lot of the hard work that's in front of us is still in front of us.,219,,
1077,0.97,7381.173,7386.112,A lot of the changes have to be bargained.,219,,
1078,0.97,7386.112,7390.316,"I don't want another lecture about white privilege, centering.",219,,
1079,0.97,7390.316,7393.919,I am told of the slogans.,219,,
1080,0.97,7393.919,7409.368,"What I really want is the city Council to listen to the community, and we have been, and also listen to the whole city about how we make our city safer, how we have a police Department that reflects our values, our humanity without tearing each other down.",219,,
1081,0.97,7409.368,7413.839,In my lifetime I have seen those institutional changes that have happened.,219,,
1082,0.97,7413.839,7418.244,I will stop my lecture in a moment.,219,,
1083,0.97,7418.244,7432.958,"I just want to tell people that this entitlement of of I want it now, that's not how the world works.",219,,
1084,0.97,7432.958,7457.85,"The privilege or entitlement of privilege of of entitlement, that's what I call it, privilege of entitlement, we are going to slowly and systematically as much as we can redirect funds from Seattle police Department to up stream programs to meet needs of what a police Department we believe should look like within confines of consent decree, bargaining responsibilities, and everything else.",219,,
1085,0.97,7457.85,7462.054,"When you hear people say and scream at you that you are not doing enough, we are doing.",219,,

1098,0.97,7496.622,7502.328,I know this is part of the macro questions that we are stepping back to analyze.,220,,
1099,0.97,7502.328,7509.301,I am getting messages from central staff that we need to move forward to get through this so we can get to our 2:00 P.M.,220,,

1106,0.97,7538.364,7556.081,I know this new data was important for me to reflect because I thought it was helpful that we didn't show the imbalance when we knew data on Attritions was going to show there was not going to be the same level of attrition as we anticipated and to be sure that was reflected.,220,,
1107,0.97,7556.081,7562.588,It was really important to me that we had an accurate document to reflect where we are in this historic time.,220,,
