29,0.97,86.586,98.865,"We'll now continue with item 6, Seattle parks and recreation and I accidentally reversed them before, so I want to make sure we're following the agenda as published.",21,,

34,0.97,115.982,116.783,Let's go on with SPR.,23,,

36,0.97,118.618,121.654,I will turn it over to Tracey.,23,,
37,0.97,121.654,123.056,"Good afternoon, Tracey.",23,,
38,0.97,123.056,124.357,"Council members, good afternoon.",24,,
39,0.97,124.357,135.735,"I'm with Council central staff, hoping to slip in and out quickly with five Cbas for Seattle parks and recreation.",24,,
40,0.97,135.735,146.112,The first is Spr01A01.,24,,
41,0.97,146.112,148.114,Council member Morales sponsored this.,24,,
42,0.97,148.114,167.033,"It would add $150,000 to parks and recreation to establish a study for the needs of the Georgetown community including the potential need for a community center.",24,,
43,0.97,167.033,168.635,Council member Morales?,25,,
44,0.97,168.635,169.636,"All right, thank you.",26,,
45,0.97,169.636,176.209,"Colleagues, I have terrible Internet today, so I'm leaving my camera off in hopes I don't lose connection again.",26,,
46,0.97,176.209,184.918,"This is for $150,000 as Tracey said to fund a feasibility study for Georgetown.",26,,
47,0.97,184.918,196.729,Our Office of planning and community development through the equitable community development report assessed Seattle communities based on the following indicators.,26,,
48,0.97,196.729,208.975,"Proximity to community centers, access to public libraries, access to grocery stores, access to parks and open space, and air pollution exposure risk.",26,,
49,0.97,208.975,216.482,George touchdown has none of these expect for air pollution exposure risk and a couple of small parks.,26,,
50,0.97,216.482,224.123,So part of why we're doing this is because the community is really interested in access to a community center.,26,,
51,0.97,224.123,237.337,"The report expresses the rationale of why it matters that communities have Walkable access to community centers, stating that community centers provide low cost fitness, recreation, and learning opportunities.",26,,
52,0.97,237.337,255.388,"They're also places where residents can connect with each other, and by Tailoring programs to the demographics of surrounding residents and giving places for groups to gather, they can also help support ethnic communities.",26,,
53,0.97,255.388,261.628,"These places can, for example, provide inexpensive Venues for forms of expression such as dance that are central to cultural identity.",26,,
54,0.97,261.628,278.444,"Georgetown is one of the few areas in the city identified as a, um, through the racial equity index area as an area that ranks as lacking or limited on all of the indicators I mentioned above.",26,,
55,0.97,278.444,292.358,"In 2017, the Seattle parks and Rec park and open space plan had several target goals, which include that had every household in Seattle should be Ãšwithin 1 to 2 miles of a community center.",26,,
56,0.97,292.358,296.496,"Despite this, um, the community center's strategic plan did not include an assessment of Georgetown.",26,,
57,0.97,296.496,307.874,"But there are various reports that have identified the need for open space and community space in Georgetown, including the Georgetown green space vision.",26,,
58,0.97,307.874,316.449,"Finally, um, the parks and Rec has outstanding commitments to additional, to add community centers throughout the city.",26,,
59,0.97,316.449,322.121,"The list that we have includes green Lake, Lake City, Mercer, South Lake Union area.",26,,
60,0.97,322.121,336.336,"These projects are on a priority list to be, um, possibly to be funded with future park district funding.",26,,
61,0.97,336.336,340.206,The Council has asked for feasibility studies for the Aurora community delayed due to Covid.,26,,
62,0.97,340.206,346.579,"Notably, none of the neighborhoods on the list are in Georgetown or the South end.",26,,
63,0.97,346.579,370.636,"So I'm asking on behalf of our Georgetown residents that we include the edition of Georgetown as a feasibility study priority, and we fund that study with the $150, $150,000.",26,,
64,0.97,370.636,371.938,"Thank you, council member Morales.",27,,
65,0.97,371.938,373.806,You came through nice and clear.,27,,
66,0.97,373.806,376.576,Happy to have you present that with no technical issues.,27,,
67,0.97,376.576,380.546,Wanted to make sure you knew that.,27,,
68,0.97,380.546,391.858,"I did have a question about that, um, last comment that perhaps either the proposed Council member or central staff can answer.",27,,
69,0.97,391.858,400.333,Can you I elaborate more on the comment about city-wide toward the North end and what the delay is city-wide?,27,,
70,0.97,400.333,404.704,"In terms of the, I wasn't sure about the feasibility study?",28,,
71,0.97,404.704,413.98,"I think it was just because of the pandemic, parks and recreation couldn't get out and do the feasibility study.",28,,
72,0.97,413.98,419.585,"They're planning on, but couldn't do the community engagement they wanted to do because of the pandemic.",28,,
73,0.97,419.585,420.052,I see.,29,,
74,0.97,420.052,430.229,"So Maybe the council member, I don't mean to put words in your mouth, but the point is other feasibility studies have been advanced to various stages, but put on hold because of the pandemic.",29,,
75,0.97,430.229,435.468,"Nothing similar was proposed for Georgetown in the past, so you're trying to play catch up?",29,,
76,0.97,435.468,438.571,That's right.,30,,
77,0.97,438.571,439.705,Okay.,31,,
78,0.97,439.705,439.939,Got it.,31,,
79,0.97,439.939,442.508,"Madam chair, if I may?",32,,
80,0.97,442.508,443.743,Go ahead Council member Juarez.,33,,
81,0.97,443.743,448.181,"Tracey, you may want to flush this out more.",34,,
82,0.97,448.181,463.83,"The reason why Greenway and Lake city were designated, and particularly Lake City, is because after the six-year study from parks, those two were set for demolition.",34,,
83,0.97,463.83,469.135,"Being built in the 50s, that's basically where the capital went.",34,,
84,0.97,469.135,473.739,"Then Aurora had a study, and they had nothing ever.",34,,
85,0.97,473.739,476.943,That's why they had the feasibility study last year that's now on hold.,34,,
86,0.97,476.943,479.345,So there wasn't a preference.,34,,
87,0.97,479.345,490.156,We base it on the superintendent's six-year cycle and the study from which the voters passed the metropolitan park district in 2019.,34,,
88,0.97,490.156,494.76,And they were specific on how we could spend that money looking forward.,34,,
89,0.97,494.76,519.385,"Long story short, when we get into next spring, and we can finally get back out there and look at the park district and the money and start the cycle again, I'm hoping that we can capture places that counselor Morales just shared where we can include those kind of mark parks, green spaces, all those things.",34,,
90,0.97,519.385,534.066,"I just want to make sure that historically, statistically, financially, budget-wise, that people understand it wasn't just a matter of Oh, we'll do these community centers and feasibility study.",34,,
91,0.97,534.066,545.711,"They were based on the parks report and the fact that as I shared, green Lake and Lake city have been set for Demo for almost five or six years.",34,,
92,0.97,545.711,547.38,So it's been a long time coming.,34,,
93,0.97,547.38,547.88,That's why.,34,,
94,0.97,547.88,560.493,Any you want to add to that Tracey except the fact that we're going to try and start up the six-year cycle again and be able to capture the other needs of other Council members' districts?,34,,
95,0.97,560.493,564.23,"Right, I think that's absolutely correct.",35,,
96,0.97,564.23,583.482,And I think the 2016 strategic plan did identify rebuild as the best options for Lake city and green Lake putting them on the path to having more robust planning for those two community centers to be rebuilt and would have to be funded in the next Npd.,35,,
97,0.97,583.482,599.732,"And we have the new community center going into, um, the former Megablog parcel in South Lake Union, and there are improvements that will need to be made to that space.",35,,
98,0.97,599.732,607.707,There's a few significant community centers in line needing funding in the next Npd or through other City resources.,35,,
99,0.97,607.707,615.414,"Tracey, can you do me a favor and maybe post, and certainly share with Council member Morales that study?",36,,
100,0.97,615.414,617.483,Because I want people to know we didn't just pick and choose.,36,,
101,0.97,617.483,621.787,We literally went from the study.,36,,
102,0.97,621.787,625.491,"And you know, been working on this since 2015.",36,,
103,0.97,625.491,635.201,"I want everyone to have the same information so when t when we start the cycle again, I can start sitting down with our colleagues and District representatives about particular neighborhoods in need.",36,,
104,0.97,635.201,647.246,"But right now, as you know, parks and Npd took multimillion dollars hits to back fill the general Fund, and I think parks is a completely other discussion.",36,,
105,0.97,647.246,648.214,Thank you.,36,,
106,0.97,648.214,650.182,Yep.,37,,
107,0.97,650.182,654.02,"Okay, thank you for that context.",38,,
108,0.97,654.02,655.621,"Council member Morales, please go ahead.",38,,
109,0.97,655.621,664.43,I just want to respond to Council member Juarez.,39,,
110,0.97,664.43,671.003,I'm certainly not meaning to indicate or imply there was a random selection of what's happening.,39,,
111,0.97,671.003,694.126,"I'm merely pointing out that the Georgetown neighborhood suffers from all of the indicators that are identified as problematic in terms of access to services and suffering from the air and noise pollution that the neighborhood, due to where it's situated, is coping with.",39,,
112,0.97,694.126,708.874,"And something like a community center will help to offer the kind of services and access to recreation, indoor recreation in particular, that folks in the neighborhood are really asking for.",39,,
113,0.97,708.874,714.08,Looking forward to talking again with you and Tracey to move forward in that.,39,,
114,0.97,714.08,714.547,Absolutely.,40,,
115,0.97,714.547,721.487,Thank you Council member Morales.,40,,
116,0.97,721.487,729.528,"Okay, thank you so much.",41,,
117,0.97,729.528,731.497,Thank you all.,41,,
118,0.97,731.497,733.999,Let's move on.,41,,
119,0.97,733.999,745.077,Moving on to item Spr2A1 sponsored by Council member Lewis and cosponsored by Council members Morales and Pederson.,42,,
120,0.97,745.077,754.086,"This would add $50,000 to the Seattle parks and recreation neighborhood response program in the 2021-26 capital improvement program.",42,,
121,0.97,754.086,771.137,"This action restores funding to the program that was reduced by $50,000 in the Mayor's 2021 proposed budget, bringing total funding for this program to $250,000 in 2021.",42,,
122,0.97,771.137,772.905,"Great, council member Lewis, please.",43,,
123,0.97,772.905,775.207,"Yes, thank you so much Tracey.",44,,
124,0.97,775.207,816.482,"This budget ad really comes from talking to community members who really value the service of the response the program has been able to provide in allowing for quick, minor infrastructure replacements and being really responsive to people organizing the community and using the parks and able to identify, um, things that can enhance, you know, our parks system and the experience and, um, you know, I realize there's still a considerable amount of money left in this even with the $50,000 cut.",44,,
125,0.97,816.482,842.875,"I wanted to bring this forward to make sure that as we're going forward you know, this, these critical, sort of basic government programs that, you know, similar to, um, your voice your choice and other things I'm raising throughout the process are still sustained and there's continuity.",44,,
126,0.97,842.875,857.256,I kind of put this in the same category as a service the city provides and would like to see maintained.,44,,
127,0.97,857.256,858.824,Any additional comments on this one?,45,,
128,0.97,858.824,861.694,"All right, thanks.",45,,
129,0.97,861.694,867.333,We did have a quick discussion about this last week.,45,,
130,0.97,867.333,867.666,Wonderful.,45,,
131,0.97,867.666,868.767,Thank you very much.,45,,
132,0.97,868.767,877.643,Let's move on to the next one.,45,,
133,0.97,877.643,887.453,This is Spr3A1 with Council member Lewis as the sponsor.,46,,
134,0.97,887.453,914.98,"This would allow parks and recreation to conduct a feasibility study looking at strategies for activating the East green belt which offers trail access, benches, and trail views of Lake Union, but the presence of garbage dumped in the area and other issues in the green belt has raised safety concerns by the community and has caused a slippage in the use and enjoyment of the area by the residents.",46,,
135,0.97,914.98,919.285,We'd look at overcoming the safety concerns.,46,,
136,0.97,919.285,925.157,"The Council requests that SPR provide a report by June 30th, 2021.",46,,
137,0.97,925.157,925.891,Thank you.,47,,
138,0.97,925.891,929.328,Council member Lewis?,47,,
139,0.97,929.328,929.828,"Thank you, Tracey.",48,,
140,0.97,929.828,948.113,So the East Queen Anne green belt is a really unique part of our outdoor space.,48,,
141,0.97,948.113,959.425,"In practice it works like a fairly large, um, park system that could rival, on the other side of Queen Anne, Kinnear park.",48,,
142,0.97,959.425,966.498,That's a development that's sort of fully developed and updated for recreational use.,48,,
143,0.97,966.498,974.139,And even for bike and pedestrian connections of inner Bay to the uptown neighborhood and Queen Anne.,48,,
144,0.97,974.139,998.63,I think that a similar project could be undertaken with the East Queen Anne green belt to provide those kinds of recreational opportunities to the neighborhood on that side of Queen Anne and potentially connect various parts of the neighborhood with trail networks scoop recreational opportunities.,48,,
145,0.97,998.63,1013.445,"As I've said before, while it is accessible, it's not really maintained, and there's not a broader purpose or vision for that space, even though it's owned partially by parks and some of it owned by other city departments.",48,,
146,0.97,1013.445,1040.406,"It would be really good to start developing a strategy, especially next year as we look into the long term investments we'll be making in the parks district and really making the best use of this large parcel of open space that's already in public ownership, but currently being underutilized.",48,,
147,0.97,1040.406,1048.547,"Thank you very much, council member Lewis.",49,,
148,0.97,1048.547,1054.72,I don't see an additional question.,49,,
149,0.97,1054.72,1055.521,Let's keep going.,49,,
150,0.97,1055.521,1056.822,Spr4A1.,50,,
151,0.97,1056.822,1063.429,"Again, primary sponsor being Council member Lewis and Council members Strauss and Gonzalez as cosponsors.",50,,
152,0.97,1063.429,1079.211,This statement of legislative intent would request Barks in collaboration with Sdot to study the feasibility cost and process involved in the potential development of a park on Sdot owned property at the Southwest corner of Mercer Street and Dexter Avenue North intersection.,50,,
153,0.97,1079.211,1085.751,It's currently Sdot right of way created as part of the Aurora tunnel construction project.,50,,
154,0.97,1085.751,1092.124,Council requests we provide a report on the results of the study by September 2021.,50,,
155,0.97,1092.124,1093.859,"Thank you, council member Lewis?",51,,
156,0.97,1093.859,1104.169,So this is a parcel of property that I'm aware of just from walking around the contradict and have been for the last couple of years.,52,,
157,0.97,1104.169,1110.442,"Initially when I brought this forward, I had been a little more prescriptive and floated the idea of a dog park.",52,,
158,0.97,1110.442,1123.489,"That's partly informed by the fact that whenever I kind of walk by this parcel, it's being used as a sort of Unsanctioned dog run already.",52,,
159,0.97,1123.489,1138.737,"But that conceded, you know, I'm not really that prescriptive about what particular use parks would want to make of it, but it's clear that people are using it for recreational and outdoor purposes.",52,,
160,0.97,1138.737,1152.751,I think it's a unique opportunity to take advantage of the parcel that as Tracey said was created from the tunnel project.,52,,
161,0.97,1152.751,1162.06,This used to be a concrete hole in the ground back in the day before we had the Mercer realignment and everything that went into that.,52,,
162,0.97,1162.06,1169.601,"I don't remember the road that used to be there, but it was definitely vacated because now there's green space.",52,,
163,0.97,1169.601,1229.995,"So the land currently, from work that Katherine Sims in my office did before she went off to law school and kind of working on the project when we were actually still meeting in person, so it's been awhile that my office have been developing it, found that it is currently owned by Sdot, so it's in city ownership, and I believe this would be a good first step to look at, um, the feasibility of whether this would be an appropriate parcel for, um, developing a park and transferring it from Sdot to parks as the general fund gets a little more flush in the future.",52,,
164,0.97,1229.995,1230.329,Wonderful.,53,,

180,0.97,1308.774,1314.78,We request the Council to work with the Snoqualmie tribe.,56,,
181,0.97,1314.78,1331.496,"Indigenous activists in Seattle have been working to amplify the history of Lichten Springs, and this year they successfully Landmarked the Springs, which I believe this is the first time they've protected something other than a building.",56,,
182,0.97,1331.496,1352.584,"Almost 3,000 people signed a petition circulated by the urban native education alliance supporting then Landmarking and explaining that since time immemorial, is the Springs have been a sacred site for the tribes of the Puget sound region.",56,,
183,0.97,1352.584,1366.298,"For countless generations, the people have gathered to harvest the sacred red Oak or medicine used for traditional healing, ceremony, spiritual renewal, and celebrations.",56,,
184,0.97,1366.298,1375.107,Lichten Springs is one of the last remaining cultural sites of the people.,56,,
185,0.97,1375.107,1380.145,We're asking the parks Department to install historical Signage lifting up this history.,56,,
186,0.97,1380.145,1387.452,We've been in touch with park staff and the parks Department has been supportive and helpful.,56,,
187,0.97,1387.452,1400.799,"But because this has been demanded for several years, my office and community organizers want to make sure the Mayor's office follows through on completing the project and it's not a casualty of budget cuts to the parks Department.",56,,
188,0.97,1400.799,1416.448,So we request marks to continue working with the indigenous activists to complete the design and installation of this historic and cultural Signage.,56,,
189,0.97,1416.448,1423.388,"Thank you, council member Sawant.",57,,

196,0.97,1457.889,1460.091,Ready to walk through Sdic?,59,,
197,0.97,1460.091,1465.03,"Yes, council central staff.",60,,
198,0.97,1465.03,1480.612,I'll walk through these 11 Council budget actions and slides in the proposed budget for 2021.,60,,
199,0.97,1480.612,1483.248,First agenda item 30.,60,,
200,0.97,1483.248,1488.42,This would add a housing technician to Sdic to the property owner assistance group for outreach.,60,,
201,0.97,1488.42,1506.705,"This would restore, um, funding and a position of authority and position authority for a position the Council added last year, but which was not fulfilled as Repurposed in the budget for elevator inspector.",60,,
202,0.97,1506.705,1521.253,Council member Strauss is the primary sponsor and Juarez and Gonzalez are Cosponsors.Sponsors.,60,,
203,0.97,1521.253,1522.687,"Yes, thank you.",61,,
204,0.97,1522.687,1534.299,In previous years we've provided funding to hire additional staff for the group that resolves requests for tenant services.,61,,
205,0.97,1534.299,1536.301,This program benefits both landlords and tenants.,61,,
206,0.97,1536.301,1547.612,"The position was never hired, and in the 2020 budget, it was redirected to be an elevator Inspector position within the Department, and that position is also necessary.",61,,
207,0.97,1547.612,1554.219,So that's why I'm proposing to add new funding and re-establish this position of authority.,61,,
208,0.97,1554.219,1568.633,"The property owner tenant assistance group needs additional staffing to resolve complaints and requests, their turn around times are now up to 68 days, which is a difference from years past.",61,,
209,0.97,1568.633,1577.943,"With the economic fallout of Covid-19 continuing and Eviction moratoriums eventually lifting, I expect their workload to go up, not down.",61,,
210,0.97,1577.943,1583.882,I believe we should be Proactivity be providing the resources to handle this increase of cases.,61,,
211,0.97,1583.882,1585.35,That's why I am bringing this forward.,61,,
212,0.97,1585.35,1587.385,Thank you.,61,,
213,0.97,1589.287,1595.86,"Thank you, council member Strauss.",62,,

215,0.97,1597.662,1602.467,I see Council member Lewis adding the names including Juarez and Gonzalez.,62,,
216,0.97,1602.467,1604.736,"Thank you very much, colleagues.",62,,
217,0.97,1604.736,1605.07,Question?,63,,
218,0.97,1605.07,1607.772,"Yes, so sorry Council member Herbold.",64,,
219,0.97,1607.772,1609.774,I'm used to looking for the virtual hands.,64,,
220,0.97,1609.774,1610.108,Real hand!,64,,
221,0.97,1610.108,1611.142,Go for it!,64,,
222,0.97,1611.142,1617.315,I just want to confirm that I heard Council member Strauss correctly.,65,,
223,0.97,1617.315,1636.935,"He said, um, council member Strauss, did you say, um, that the funding was not used for the purpose of tenant outreach staffer but instead was used for an elevator Inspector?",65,,
224,0.97,1636.935,1637.769,That' my understanding.,66,,
225,0.97,1637.769,1638.503,That's correct.,67,,
226,0.97,1638.503,1644.609,And I think what that reflects is a couple of things.,67,,
227,0.97,1644.609,1667.499,"One is a hiring freeze associated with a downturn in general fund revenue this year, and also this is true across departments and a couple of positions at Sdic, Repurposing position authority to keep people employed, um, with funded positions.",67,,
228,0.97,1667.499,1677.308,"So a hiring freeze for the Council's priorities, but not for the executives.",68,,
229,0.97,1677.308,1689.054,"I would like to add my name to this, please.",68,,
230,0.97,1689.054,1694.959,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",69,,

236,0.97,1725.99,1727.492,Thank you.,72,,
237,0.97,1727.492,1733.498,This proposal adds funding to expand enforcement of tree regulations by hiring two additional members of the team that conducts enforcement.,72,,
238,0.97,1733.498,1748.413,"I think all of our officers have experienced getting calls from community members about a tree being taken down without their knowing, and we often can't do anything.",72,,
239,0.97,1748.413,1761.926,"Part of that is because we need a tree protection ordinance, but in the interim, before we pass that order ordinance, we can address the current weaknesses in enforcement practices.",72,,
240,0.97,1761.926,1776.741,"I've heard too many examples of staff getting there a minute too late and finding a stump where the tree once was,, and in 2018 they were solved in 51 days.",72,,
241,0.97,1776.741,1782.614,"In 2019 it was 169 days, and this year is 147 days.",72,,
242,0.97,1782.614,1786.651,And that's not due to city staff not doing their job.,72,,
243,0.97,1786.651,1797.662,It's just that we're at a time that we need more attention paid and resources to be able to enforcement the regulations already on the book.,72,,
244,0.97,1797.662,1813.011,Our staff need to be equipped to protect trees and prevent illegal Removals.,72,,
245,0.97,1813.011,1823.454,"By adding additional reinforcement, teams will be able to reach the trees before the Removals happen.",72,,

259,0.97,1897.862,1912.477,"Thank you specifically to Council members Gonzalez, Pederson, and Juarez for your Cosponsorship of this legislative intent which would require them to report on permit review times and progress on meeting review turn around goals.",76,,
260,0.97,1912.477,1922.987,"The report should include process times for simple construction permits, complex construction permits, and master use permits.",76,,
261,0.97,1922.987,1932.997,"They've been managing a long backlog of permit applications for years, and it's common for it to take 24 months for reviews to be made.",76,,
262,0.97,1932.997,1942.707,"It doesn't just create a challenging level of unpredictability for applicants, but also reduces our ability to bring the housing we need Online in an efficient manner.",76,,
263,0.97,1942.707,1957.021,"They've taken great steps in recent years to address the backlog, including increasing permit fees and changing staff practices, which has better enabled them to turn around permits quickly.",76,,
264,0.97,1957.021,1976.941,This will help Council better understand the additional barriers that remain to shortening review times so we can address complications or barriers in real time and identify how Council may be able to help in this jurisdiction.,76,,
265,0.97,1976.941,1977.241,Thank you.,76,,
266,0.97,1977.241,1981.846,Any additional questions or comments?,77,,
267,0.97,1981.846,1987.919,You so you're looking for point in time information to better inform future policy decisions?,77,,
268,0.97,1987.919,1988.686,"That's correct, chair.",78,,

275,0.97,2041.506,2048.513,This would add half a million dollars for outreach education and other services to the general fund.,80,,
276,0.97,2048.513,2055.887,"There's about $650,000 in the Mayor's proposed budget for these services.",80,,
277,0.97,2055.887,2071.068,"Last year Sdci completed about $915,000 for tenant services, so there were some one time additions reflected in the Mayor's 2021 budget.",80,,
278,0.97,2071.068,2080.478,"It's similar to agenda item 37, so you could consider them to be distinct and or additive to each other.",80,,

292,0.97,2161.726,2172.236,"In reality it would have been far simpler when Strauss had cosponsored the budget amendment sent weeks ago rather than submitting a duplicate, but it doesn't matter.",84,,
293,0.97,2172.236,2177.241,What matters is these tenant rights organizations are funded.,84,,

310,0.97,2298.562,2317.048,"For example, I think Renters should be able to remove Amendmented, unjust convictions not upheld by the courts from rental histories, but right now there's no technically feasible way to present it to landlords.",89,,

331,0.97,2419.283,2424.789,And thank you to Council members Morales and Gonzalez for their Cosponsorship.,96,,
332,0.97,2424.789,2430.661,I believe Council members Herbold and Lewis have also cosponsored if I'm not wrong.,96,,
333,0.97,2430.661,2453.484,"Like the previous item, this proposes also a statement of legislative intent requesting the Department of construction and inspections to work with the Seattle Renters Commission to draft standard terms appropriate for all residential rental leases with input from organizations representing Renters and landlords.",96,,
334,0.97,2453.484,2462.96,"In the last meeting of the Renters committee chaired by my office, we heard from Renters who were prohibited from displaying black lives matter signs in their windows.",96,,
335,0.97,2462.96,2465.93,This is one example.,96,,
336,0.97,2465.93,2475.84,It's just one of the many outrageous and unjust lease terms that Renters accept in their leases because the overwhelming majority of Renters have no power over what's actually in their lease.,96,,
337,0.97,2475.84,2483.414,At the time idea that the lease is a mutually agreed upon and negotiated document is a fiction in most circumstances.,96,,
338,0.97,2483.414,2497.461,So the intention of this statement of legislative intent so to prepare for a future ordinance to require all residential rental leases to include certain standard terms.,96,,
339,0.97,2497.461,2506.07,There will be some standard terms that should makeup basic rights and responsibilities for all Renters and all landlords.,96,,
340,0.97,2506.07,2517.715,"It will require broad community input to know what lease terms should be considered universal, to the statement request that the Department and Renter Commission work on making those recommendations.",96,,
341,0.97,2525.923,2531.095,Thank you Council member Sawant.,97,,
342,0.97,2531.095,2532.663,Any questions?,97,,
343,0.97,2532.663,2533.23,Not seeing any questions.,97,,
344,0.97,2533.23,2545.309,I see Council members Herbold and Lewis joining with Council member Morales and Gonzalez and cosponsors.,97,,
345,0.97,2545.309,2546.81,Thank you very much.,97,,
346,0.97,2546.81,2553.751,"All right, moving on to agenda item number 36, Sdci7A1.",98,,
347,0.97,2553.751,2564.228,"This would add $750,000 in general fund to Sdci for Eviction legal defense partnerships.",98,,
348,0.97,2564.228,2565.095,Thank you very much.,99,,
349,0.97,2565.095,2566.697,Council member Sawant?,99,,
350,0.97,2566.697,2568.432,Thank you.,100,,
351,0.97,2568.432,2578.442,"Again, thank you to Council member Morales and Council President Gonzalez, and I believe also Council members Lewis and Herbold who have agreed to cosponsor.",100,,
352,0.97,2578.442,2597.161,"This budget action adds $750,000 to the Department of construction and inspections to contract with a Renter Eviction defense organization to provide free legal defense for any Renter facing Eviction in Seattle.",100,,
353,0.97,2597.161,2608.472,"If the Council supports this, my office will also propose an associated ordinance to create the right to counsel for all facing Eviction in Seattle.",100,,
354,0.97,2608.472,2617.448,"There are about 1200 Eviction court filings in Seattle, not counting Unfiled Evictions or Eviction notices.",100,,
355,0.97,2617.448,2636.367,"The housing project estimates $750,000 would fund an decisional 5 attorneys and 2 Paralegals, and also is very emphatic in stating that this is absolutely necessary, not only given the prevailing status, but also what we expect to see once the moratoriums are lifted.",100,,
356,0.97,2636.367,2641.705,So it's really important that Renters have an attorney with them.,100,,
357,0.97,2641.705,2653.217,And studies have shown that will be a wave of Evictions after the emergency ends and the moratoriums are lifted.,100,,
358,0.97,2653.217,2660.224,"Even outside of the pandemic itself, there's a recession which has been, um, unfortunately exacerbated because of the pandemic.",100,,
359,0.97,2660.224,2670.0,So the overall number of tenants who will be facing Evictions in the near future is going to likely explode.,100,,
360,0.97,2670.0,2685.883,"A couple of years ago, the people's budget movement won the first funding, and the following year we were able to increase with Council support to 2 Eviction defense attorneys.",100,,
361,0.97,2685.883,2696.326,The housing justice project estimates a 56% Overallest t success rate since 2019 in keeping tenants housed.,100,,
362,0.97,2696.326,2702.066,Up from less than 24% two years ago.,100,,
363,0.97,2702.066,2704.168,So even these small investments have had a big impact.,100,,
364,0.97,2704.168,2707.938,And anyone that's been a Renter knows that makes all the difference.,100,,
365,0.97,2707.938,2711.175,Not having an Eviction on your record makes all the different.,100,,
366,0.97,2711.175,2729.193,"This budget amendment would provide funding to make access to legal representation a right for any Renter facing Eviction in Seattle, but of course we need to follow it up by an ordinance to create the right to counsel for all Renters facing Eviction.",100,,
367,0.97,2729.193,2734.865,Thank you very much Council member Sawant.,101,,
368,0.97,2734.865,2736.667,Any other questions?,101,,
369,0.97,2736.667,2740.571,I have a question about the sequencing.,101,,
370,0.97,2740.571,2759.656,"Because you funded or championed and the Council funded positions in the past that didn't require that legislation, can you talk about what the difference is between either adding attorneys to this position or policy changes you're seeking through legislation?",101,,
371,0.97,2759.656,2780.31,"Um, I think they, um, I would say they are both necessary pieces meaning the funding for the Eviction defense Ttorneys is absolutely crucial because without that funding they wouldn't have the positions.",102,,
372,0.97,2780.31,2783.714,So just having the funding makes a difference.,102,,
373,0.97,2783.714,2818.882,"And I'm not sure, I mean, it's hard to predict how many Renters will be, will be in the unfortunate position of having to seek this kind of assistance, but we developed this dollar figure estimate based on what the housing and justice project advised us, so in that sense, this budget item would be the funding to make this possible, but we also want to Encode it in the law that if you are a Renter facing Eviction in Seattle, then by law you have the right to a legal defense.",102,,
374,0.97,2818.882,2820.584,Thank you for that clarification.,103,,
375,0.97,2820.584,2839.903,"Also, just for central staff, can you remind us as well, we do have some funding that we have as a Council championed for 2021 through the jump start payroll tax I think to the tune of $8 million, is that correct?",103,,
376,0.97,2839.903,2841.872,I don't know.,104,,
377,0.97,2841.872,2845.375,"Perhaps if Aly is on the line, she can Chime in.",104,,
378,0.97,2845.375,2856.72,"I can tell you what was appropriated last year, which doesn't answer your question, but that was $230,000.",104,,
379,0.97,2856.72,2865.095,But that's some additional context.,104,,
380,0.97,2865.095,2869.099,I'm not seeing Aly --,104,,
381,0.97,2869.099,2872.436,I'm here.,105,,
382,0.97,2872.436,2872.836,Sorry.,105,,
383,0.97,2872.836,2901.465,"That's right, some of that is for the home base program that has expanded in Covid and everything, so it's not for Eviction legal defense, however it's a good partnership between the attorneys that work with the housing justice project and other things to have a resource available to help, um, cure Evictions if there are funds available so the two investments would work hand in hand.",105,,
384,0.97,2901.465,2918.849,"With you those fund in the jump start were to the human services Department for rental assistance and homeless services, which doesn't typically include funding for the Eviction legal defense.",105,,
385,0.97,2918.849,2920.951,That's very helpful.,106,,
386,0.97,2920.951,2922.386,Thank you very much.,106,,
387,0.97,2922.386,2922.886,Okay.,106,,
388,0.97,2922.886,2924.888,Thank you very much.,106,,
389,0.97,2924.888,2931.495,Let me just summarize that.,106,,
390,0.97,2931.495,2934.031,We had one additional Council member Lewis.,106,,
391,0.97,2934.031,2936.333,So thank you very much.,106,,
392,0.97,2936.333,2936.633,Last three.,106,,
393,0.97,2936.633,2939.603,Council member Pederson.,106,,
394,0.97,2939.603,2944.608,We have one more here from Council member Sawant.,107,,
395,0.97,2944.608,2954.918,"Sorry, I keep being one line off in my spread sheet.",108,,
396,0.97,2954.918,2956.386,Sdci8A1.,109,,
397,0.97,2956.386,2963.66,"It would add $500,000 for outreach, education, and organizing.",109,,
398,0.97,2963.66,2966.63,Council member Sawant is the prime it will sponsor.,109,,
399,0.97,2966.63,2968.432,"All right, council member Sawant.",110,,
400,0.97,2968.432,2970.634,Sorry to cut you off there.,110,,
401,0.97,2970.634,2972.502,Let's do your last one.,110,,
402,0.97,2972.502,2973.403,No problem.,111,,
403,0.97,2973.403,2977.774,And thank you to Council members Morales and Lewis for Cosponsoring.,111,,
404,0.97,2977.774,2994.024,"As I mentioned, when we just discussed the previous item on today's budget, it's a budget amendment to increase funding for Renter's rights organizations.",111,,
405,0.97,2994.024,3010.874,Organizations like the tenants unit of Washington State do incredibly important work to help educate Renters about their rights and organize buildings to bargain collectively against landlords who might be exploited or even abusive.,111,,
406,0.97,3010.874,3026.857,"They do heroic work with chronically insufficient resources, as we know, and given the deluge of Evictions expected over the next year in Seattle, and this is going to be a nationwide problem, it's essential the city increase funding to these community organizations.",111,,
407,0.97,3026.857,3034.498,"Half of Seattle is renting, and the funding available to support them is shockingly limited.",111,,
408,0.97,3034.498,3039.002,"And even with such limited resources, these organizations have had a significant impact.",111,,
409,0.97,3039.002,3056.753,My office has been proud over the last two years to join the Seattle rights good cams where Renters from across the city see posters in their neighborhood and come to have their questions answered and get support in housing situations.,111,,
410,0.97,3056.753,3084.047,"And we were also proud to join the Washington housing community action network some years ago in successfully fighting to limit Renter movement fee, and we have again and again worked with the tenant Union to help Representers whose rights have been violated.",111,,
411,0.97,3084.047,3096.626,"Again and again Renters have called my office, and we get them in touch with organizers and the tenant's unit along with the Renters rights enforcement staff.",111,,
412,0.97,3096.626,3108.972,"There's no question these organizations are overworked, and I hope all Council members cosponsor this small increase in their funding.",111,,
413,0.97,3108.972,3109.372,Thank you.,112,,
414,0.97,3109.372,3115.078,Additional comments on this one?,112,,
415,0.97,3115.078,3116.179,Thank you so much.,112,,
416,0.97,3116.179,3119.649,I see Council member Morales and Lewis signed on as cosponsors.,112,,
417,0.97,3119.649,3127.691,I think we're to our last and final category.,112,,
418,0.97,3127.691,3138.602,The long awaited last three from Council member Pederson.,112,,
419,0.97,3138.602,3139.102,"Sorry, Y'all.",112,,
420,0.97,3139.102,3140.504,Let's go through those.,112,,
421,0.97,3140.504,3145.509,"Council member, walk us through this.",112,,
422,0.97,3145.509,3161.424,"Yes, the last action is Sdci9A1 adding $250,000 in general fund to develop and implement a data and monitoring center to track economic and physical displacement.",113,,
423,0.97,3161.424,3167.731,The action is contemplated by the companion resolution to the city wide Mha bill.,113,,
424,0.97,3167.731,3181.144,Council member Pederson is the primary sponsor and Council members Herbold and Morales are cosponsors.,113,,
425,0.97,3181.144,3191.154,"Thank you, it's really refreshing to find this common ground that we have on displacement issues.",114,,
426,0.97,3191.154,3193.723,We discussed this during issue identification.,114,,
427,0.97,3193.723,3210.84,"I know we support creating more affordable housing throughout Seattle, and in addition to supporting new construction, we also want to ensure a net gain, so we need to track and measure affordable housing.",114,,
428,0.97,3210.84,3225.956,"When moving ahead with new construction projects, we want to ensure we have a detailed and accurate system to pack the potential loss or demolition of existing natural occurring affordable housing and.",114,,
429,0.97,3225.956,3240.403,This enables us to better quantify and mitigate our new and existing stock of affordable housing.,114,,
430,0.97,3240.403,3249.279,So this asks the city executive to create data and report us to on the status and trend of income households.,114,,
431,0.97,3249.279,3252.716,This needs to include rent levels and the supply of affordable housing.,114,,
432,0.97,3252.716,3254.117,We need to better understand the net impacts.,114,,
433,0.97,3254.117,3271.635,"These funds are needed to set up the system to collect the detailed housing data to insure we achieve the goals of more low income housing, more integration in our neighborhoods, and less displacement of Seattle residents.",114,,
434,0.97,3271.635,3272.035,Thank you.,114,,
435,0.97,3272.035,3274.638,Thank you Council member Pederson.,115,,
436,0.97,3274.638,3281.845,Questions or comments?,115,,
437,0.97,3281.845,3290.654,"Okay, I'm seeing no questions or comments.",115,,
438,0.97,3290.654,3295.258,Thank you very much.,115,,
439,0.97,3295.258,3297.861,Let's go to the next one.,115,,
440,0.97,3297.861,3309.306,"The next action is Sdci10A1, a statement of legislative intent sponsored by Council member Pederson, cosponsored by Herbold and Lewis.",116,,
441,0.97,3309.306,3354.718,"This requests that Sdci and the office report to the Council of land use and neighborhoods Committee on payment versus performance under the mandatory housing Affordability program as the Councilmembers will recall, when the Council adopted the framework for the mandatory housing Affordability program through the ordinance, the Council intended in areas outside of downtown and South Lake Union, developers should be indifferent for larger sized projects as to payment and performance, so this is a report to help quantify how Department of water and Powerrers are making the choices since the program was implemented.",116,,
442,0.97,3354.718,3355.051,Thank you.,117,,
443,0.97,3355.051,3355.819,Council member Pederson?,117,,
444,0.97,3355.819,3361.391,"Thank you, chair and thank you to my cosponsors.",118,,
445,0.97,3361.391,3380.31,The framework for the mandatory housing affordable program requires real estate developers to include housing for low income households in the housing projects or to pay a fee in lieu of performance to the city office of housing to contribute to the construction of affordable housing.,118,,
446,0.97,3380.31,3389.753,That ordinance SETS policy on the balance of on site performance and payment in lieu as follows.,118,,
447,0.97,3389.753,3397.861,The Council will consider raising payment amounts to prevent a bias toward payment.,118,,
448,0.97,3397.861,3403.933,We want a 50/50 balance on site right now versus writing a check and building it later.,118,,
449,0.97,3403.933,3417.514,"Building the affordable housing on site inputs social justice principles such as buildings it immediately, instead of years later, and integrating the affordable housing within each neighborhood instead of concentrating it elsewhere.",118,,
450,0.97,3417.514,3433.296,"While the current status is reported annually by the office of housing, we should see the data more frequently and combine it with the information from the Seattle Department of construction and inspection because developers indicate their choice when Theyapply for permits.",118,,
451,0.97,3433.296,3441.337,This requests we produce the data together and more frequently so we can really know if we're meeting the goal of the 50/50 balance.,118,,
452,0.97,3441.337,3441.571,Thank you.,118,,
453,0.97,3450.146,3457.42,Additional comments or questions?,119,,
454,0.97,3457.42,3460.29,I'm seeing none.,119,,
455,0.97,3460.29,3463.993,"You did speak to this, council member Pederson.",119,,
456,0.97,3463.993,3472.135,You mentioned the information is already being generated in the Mha annual report.,119,,
457,0.97,3472.135,3473.803,Basically you'd like to see that quarterly?,119,,
458,0.97,3473.803,3481.444,"Yes, and then making sure it's combined with the Sdci information.",120,,
459,0.97,3481.444,3481.711,Okay.,121,,
460,0.97,3481.711,3488.852,And what effect would this have in addition to the report that we're already receiving?,121,,
461,0.97,3488.852,3496.926,You would basically use it to inform possible policy positions on an annual basis?,121,,
462,0.97,3496.926,3513.176,"If the goal is 50/50, we need to know for sure if we're achieving 50/ 50, and it's possible to consider updating the policies to get back to the 50/50 if we're not achieving it.",122,,
463,0.97,3513.176,3521.384,But the initial thing is just getting the report that's combined and more frequent.,122,,
464,0.97,3521.384,3521.684,Okay.,123,,
465,0.97,3521.684,3523.019,Thank you so much.,123,,
466,0.97,3523.019,3524.954,I don't see additional questions on this.,123,,
467,0.97,3524.954,3541.17,"I may have some follow up questions on the sort of desired goal for this report, and then also on the previous one, there's a lot of different ways to define displacement.",123,,
468,0.97,3541.17,3558.321,"Economic displacement, cultural displacement, physical displacement, and would like to make sure we're looking at the role that development is having and not just using displacement as one blanket term.",123,,
469,0.97,3558.321,3559.289,I'll follow up with you on those items.,123,,
470,0.97,3559.289,3566.329,And I don't know if you had any thoughts about a certain type of displacement being evaluated.,123,,
471,0.97,3566.329,3589.118,"What I understand the proposal would be using information that, um, participants in the rental registration program would provide, so if that sense that would allow the city to get Disaggregated information about current rents.",124,,
472,0.97,3589.118,3604.467,"They'd probably need to be Aggregated for the purposes of reporting, but would provide a level of information that the city doesn't currently have about rents by building.",124,,
473,0.97,3604.467,3609.138,Very helpful.,125,,
474,0.97,3609.138,3610.974,"Okay, no decisional questions?",125,,
475,0.97,3610.974,3618.181,Cosponsors Herbold and Lewis and Sawant as well.,125,,
476,0.97,3618.181,3618.781,Okay.,126,,
477,0.97,3618.781,3620.383,Any other amendments today?,126,,
478,0.97,3620.383,3622.051,One more.,126,,
479,0.97,3622.051,3623.987,Let's do this last one.,126,,
480,0.97,3623.987,3629.993,The final action after discussion today is Sdci11A1.,127,,
481,0.97,3629.993,3643.039,This is sponsored by Council member Pederson with cosponsors in Council members Herbold and Lewis.,127,,
