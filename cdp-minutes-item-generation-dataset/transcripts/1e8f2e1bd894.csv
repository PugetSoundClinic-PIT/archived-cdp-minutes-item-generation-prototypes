52,0.97,358.057,363.763,We are both honored to participate today to declare April sexual assault month for the city of Seattle.,16,,
53,0.97,363.763,389.789,Awareness events and through the year can an important opportunity to make visible the persistent and pervasive nature of the abuses of power that continue to thriving in our so% long as from Harassment in person or Online to physical assault and rape all forms of sexual violence are rooted and compounded by racism and Sexism and other forms of oppression.,16,,
54,0.97,389.789,399.932,Gender base violence programs bear witness to this by supporting Survivers to hear more I will hand to it Rite.,16,,
55,0.97,399.932,414.113,Thank you the proclamation recognizes that sexual violence is not the victim's fault but we have a way to prevent sexual violence in our communities.,17,,
56,0.97,414.113,415.915,We represent all ages and Jeopardies.,17,,
57,0.97,415.915,423.723,One-third of our clients are yellow and 60% of black indigenous or a Surviver of color.,17,,
58,0.97,423.723,440.807,Through our work we witness the sexual abuse through prison pipe lines where girls are abused and assaulted and harassed and then dismissed or discarded for saying anything and then blamed and punished for acting out of fear or frustration and trauma.,17,,
59,0.97,440.807,465.731,We represent and stand with Survivers every day in Courtrooms and title 9 hearings and hr investigations and immigration interviews and administrative meetings and see the terrible impact and devastation from their sexual assaults but also from systems and institutions that Prioritize their Abusers reputation and future over the Survivers' trauma and safety.,17,,
60,0.97,465.731,469.368,Reports of sexual assaults are at an all-time high.,17,,
61,0.97,469.368,481.48,In the past two years the number of calls and referrals we have received have tripled but investigations and petitions are at the lowest in years.,17,,
62,0.97,481.48,490.957,This is all while per PA Traction of sexual violence continues to evolve that requires advocacy to evolve as well.,17,,
63,0.97,490.957,494.827,The sexual violence law center has technology to control the initiatives.,17,,
64,0.97,494.827,508.808,"First started by advocates from the community we worked with and Techy has evolved into a trauma informed legal response to Abusers using Digital technologies and platforms to control, harass and Humiliate a Surviver.",17,,
65,0.97,508.808,520.152,It is not good enough to tell a Surviver to close an account buy a new device or ignore it technology enabled device is not the future but it is here.,17,,
66,0.97,520.152,525.024,We can't keep up with the number of cases referred but we are trying.,17,,
67,0.97,525.024,539.205,For too long Abusers and Perpetrators have been protected by institutions and supported by communities and their tactics ignored and their behaviors excused and often blamed on their victim who is then shamed and ousted and isolated.,17,,
68,0.97,539.205,549.982,It is for this reason it is so crucial that along with this proclamation Seattle continues to support and Prioritize services and programs for survivors.,17,,
69,0.97,549.982,553.419,We ask survivors to step up and share their me too moment.,17,,
70,0.97,553.419,569.268,"Yet if we do not make available counseling and housing and resources and social services and civil legal aid to Survivers who seek out support, we become another source of perpetuating the trauma we seek to address.",17,,
71,0.97,569.268,572.371,This proclamation gives me hope.,17,,
72,0.97,572.371,583.282,It is with recognizing and naming the problem with Prioritizing funding and increasing support for Surviver services like harbor view abuse and trauma center.,17,,
73,0.97,583.282,587.486,"Mother nation, King County sexual assault resource center.",17,,

77,0.97,607.039,622.455,As was explained programs across the city have experienced a significant increase in the need for services in part due to the profound effects of the pandemic and also I believe due to the increased awareness of what sexual violence is and help is available.,18,,
