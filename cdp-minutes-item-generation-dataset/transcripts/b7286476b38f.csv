184,0.97,1016.215,1028.093,We are very excited to be here today.,39,,
185,0.97,1032.531,1035.567,"Our group covers a number of things, if you which we will get into later.",39,,
186,0.97,1035.567,1040.105,"We really try to focus our work, especially in this new and emerging space, round the values of climate safety in equity.",39,,
187,0.97,1040.105,1044.376,"We are here to discuss a few pieces of portfolio today, including Scooter share pilot, as well as some other items.",39,,
188,0.97,1044.376,1049.381,"I would like to introduce Becky Edmonds, a longtime Sdot employee who has recently joined our team to lead the Micro mobility program.",39,,
189,0.97,1049.381,1050.482,Take it away.,39,,
190,0.97,1050.482,1054.987,"Good morning, everyone.",40,,
191,0.97,1054.987,1057.856,I am Becky Edmonds and I will be talking about our Scooter share pilot.,40,,
192,0.97,1057.856,1071.904,"I will do a little bit of background, get into our numbers, and talk about how this helps us meet our equity, safety, and climate goals.",40,,
193,0.97,1071.904,1073.572,Then we will get into Takeaways and next steps.,40,,
194,0.97,1073.572,1076.208,Seattle has had some form of Micro mobility for a while now.,40,,
195,0.97,1076.208,1077.709,We first had my chair starting in 2014.,40,,
196,0.97,1077.709,1078.677,It was called pronto.,40,,
197,0.97,1078.677,1090.088,Eventually that shut down and we moved from that which was a station based system to a Free- floating model.,40,,
198,0.97,1090.088,1092.524,We were one of the first cities to do that in 2017.,40,,
199,0.97,1092.524,1098.497,2018 is when we start to see E- Scooters emerging as a shared mode nationally.,40,,
200,0.97,1098.497,1099.832,"In Seattle, we took our time.",40,,
201,0.97,1099.832,1104.937,I will get into how we designed our pilot before eventually launching the Scooter program in October 2020.,40,,
202,0.97,1104.937,1107.306,Next slide?,40,,
203,0.97,1107.306,1116.915,We are not alone.,40,,
204,0.97,1116.915,1119.818,"As I mentioned, Scooters have been around for a little while in North America.",40,,
205,0.97,1119.818,1123.422,There are over 200 cities in North America that have some form of Micro mobility.,40,,
206,0.97,1123.422,1123.922,Next slide?,40,,
207,0.97,1123.922,1129.328,"So in terms of how we design our pilot, we wanted to be really intentional.",40,,
208,0.97,1129.328,1141.173,We took about a year and a half to develop the pilot.,40,,
209,0.97,1141.173,1143.509,We worked with over 30 Stakeholder groups and surveyed 750 residents.,40,,
210,0.97,1143.509,1151.817,We took lessons from other cities that had been doing this before us and took lessons learned from our own bike share system.,40,,
211,0.97,1151.817,1153.552,We had to grapple with some difficult decisions.,40,,
212,0.97,1153.552,1155.654,"As an example, one of those is sidewalk writing.",40,,
213,0.97,1155.654,1157.289,We decided to not allow Scooters on sidewalks.,40,,
214,0.97,1157.289,1165.597,"Eventually after all that process, council passed legislation in September 2020 and we started our Scooter pilot soon after that.",40,,
215,0.97,1165.597,1171.47,Next slide?,40,,
216,0.97,1171.47,1175.407,"In our pilot, we have four different Scooter vendors.",40,,
217,0.97,1175.407,1180.379,This was an intentional choice to show a variety of different options.,40,,
218,0.97,1180.379,1194.793,"Line was chosen partially because they operate by chairs, as well.",40,,
219,0.97,1194.793,1206.038,"Then we have link, which offers a standing Scooter.",40,,
220,0.97,1206.038,1209.541,"Wheels offers a sitting style Scooter, which provides a different option and is more comfortable for certain users.",40,,
221,0.97,1209.541,1210.776,"Finally, we have a fourth vendor.",40,,
222,0.97,1210.776,1212.744,We invited them in a little later to the pilot.,40,,
223,0.97,1212.744,1231.93,"They specifically have something called Drover A.I., which gives feedback to users about how they park their device and keeps people off the sidewalks when they should not be there.",40,,
224,0.97,1231.93,1234.466,Next slide?,40,,
225,0.97,1234.466,1236.335,These are our five objectives of the Scooter pilot.,40,,
226,0.97,1236.335,1242.074,We developed these in collaboration with the community and also based on our bike share program.,40,,
227,0.97,1242.074,1265.063,"We want to provide active and low carbon transportation options, expand accessibility and use by black and indigenous people, Nonblack people of color, low-income people, immigrants and refugees, and people with limited English proficiency.",40,,
228,0.97,1265.063,1267.466,We wanted to be safe and keep our sidewalks safe and accessible.,40,,
229,0.97,1267.466,1269.468,"Finally, we wanted to provide accessible and Adaptive mobility options.",40,,
230,0.97,1269.468,1269.801,Next slide?,40,,
231,0.97,1269.801,1279.578,A lot goes into managing our pilot with Scooters.,40,,
232,0.97,1279.578,1280.912,This shows all of those elements.,40,,
233,0.97,1280.912,1282.481,Some of those are the data we take in.,40,,
234,0.97,1282.481,1290.122,We have real-time data feeds from all of our vendors.,40,,
235,0.97,1290.122,1291.156,We maintain relationships with our vendors.,40,,
236,0.97,1291.156,1294.626,"We have been putting in infrastructure, which includes designated parking locations that keeps our sidewalks clear.",40,,
237,0.97,1294.626,1295.861,And we do a lot of evaluation.,40,,
238,0.97,1295.861,1297.262,We promote access and Affordability.,40,,
239,0.97,1297.262,1302.167,"On the other side, there is the regulatory piece, which includes the code changes and compliance.",40,,
240,0.97,1302.167,1306.838,Next slide?,40,,
241,0.97,1306.838,1319.751,"Most of the data in this presentation covers our first full year of the pilot, which ran from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021.",40,,
242,0.97,1319.751,1322.054,We took a Data-Driven approach as we looked through our pilot.,40,,
243,0.97,1322.054,1331.663,These are our different data sources.,40,,
244,0.97,1331.663,1333.031,This includes the trip feeds from vendors.,40,,
245,0.97,1333.031,1334.066,We get membership reports.,40,,
246,0.97,1334.066,1334.9,We audit the parking situation.,40,,
247,0.97,1334.9,1339.337,"We did a survey that I will get into a little bit more detail on later, which had over 4000 respondents.",40,,
248,0.97,1339.337,1343.275,We look at policy through police reports and constituent feedback.,40,,
249,0.97,1343.275,1344.776,Next slide?,40,,
250,0.97,1344.776,1346.778,Now we will get into the numbers.,40,,
251,0.97,1346.778,1351.583,Did people use Scooter share?,40,,
252,0.97,1351.583,1352.584,The resounding answer is yes.,40,,
253,0.97,1352.584,1356.688,We had over 1.4 million trips in that first year.,40,,
254,0.97,1356.688,1358.29,This does track with how many devices were deployed.,40,,
255,0.97,1358.29,1376.274,"In the chart on the right, you can see the blue bars show deployment of Scooters, which grew steadily over the course of the pilot, as did how many trips there were per day.",40,,
256,0.97,1376.274,1379.111,"By chairs remained a little lower than that, but pretty steady during that time.",40,,
257,0.97,1379.111,1381.613,The average Scooters on the street during the pilot was 2600 about.,40,,
258,0.97,1381.613,1386.718,You can see that that was in the middle.,40,,
259,0.97,1386.718,1389.321,"As we grew, it got to over 4000 by September.",40,,
260,0.97,1389.321,1391.022,Next slide?,40,,
261,0.97,1391.022,1394.526,What kinds of trips are people taking?,40,,
262,0.97,1394.526,1398.23,The average trip was about 15 minutes long.,40,,
263,0.97,1398.23,1398.83,It went 1.4 miles.,40,,
264,0.97,1398.83,1413.278,That would cost a little over $6 . that is based on the average numbers and their cost structure.,40,,
265,0.97,1413.278,1427.259,"The vendors do offer various options for reducing the cost, including the reduced fare programs, as well as things like monthly passes and other options for frequent users.",40,,
266,0.97,1427.259,1432.631,We can go back to that previous slide.,40,,
267,0.97,1432.631,1434.666,"On the right, you will see the unique riders we counted.",40,,
268,0.97,1434.666,1440.772,"I did want to show five different vendors, as a number of people may have signed up for multiple.",40,,
269,0.97,1440.772,1445.777,There were over a quarter of 1 million unique users of the system.,40,,
270,0.97,1445.777,1448.68,That works out to three rides on average per user.,40,,
271,0.97,1448.68,1453.685,There is a pretty big range in terms of the actual numbers of rides individuals take.,40,,
272,0.97,1453.685,1456.354,You can go to the next slide now.,40,,
273,0.97,1456.354,1462.227,"I'm going to talk a little bit about the user survey that we completed in November 2021, so pretty recent.",40,,
274,0.97,1462.227,1469.468,It was promoted via the vendors to users of Scooters.,40,,
275,0.97,1469.468,1473.805,"We got over 4000 respondents, people who used the Scooters.",40,,
276,0.97,1473.805,1483.415,This gave us a lot of information we do have about safety as well as rider experience and how people are behaving when they are using Scooters.,40,,
277,0.97,1483.415,1485.984,Next slide?,40,,
278,0.97,1485.984,1486.818,Who is using Scooter share?,40,,
279,0.97,1486.818,1492.123,This is what we got from our survey.,40,,
280,0.97,1492.123,1496.094,"First of all, we found that 56% of Scooter users reported also having used bike shares.",40,,
281,0.97,1496.094,1504.135,There is overlap and also a unique set of users.,40,,
282,0.97,1504.135,1514.846,"In terms of race, the racial demographics were pretty similar to the Seattle population.",40,,
283,0.97,1514.846,1517.516,We found that 15% of users identified as having some kind of disability.,40,,
284,0.97,1517.516,1526.525,"We found that 65% of users identified as men, which is an Overrepresentation compared to the general population.",40,,
285,0.97,1526.525,1537.168,"In terms of household income, it seems like there is a pretty diverse range of household incomes and people who use the Scooter program.",40,,
286,0.97,1537.168,1539.671,We can go to the next slide from there.,40,,
287,0.97,1539.671,1542.841,Now we will get a little bit into our equity Metrics.,40,,
288,0.97,1542.841,1557.789,"First of all, we have a requirement that vendors deploy 10% of their fleet to equity focus areas, which are shown on the map on the right.",40,,
289,0.97,1557.789,1559.991,"Overall, we saw 15 1/2% were deployed in those equity areas.",40,,
290,0.97,1559.991,1567.999,We are meeting that goal and we also know that that is just one baseline and there is more to do in terms of equity.,40,,
291,0.97,1567.999,1569.467,We will go to the next slide.,40,,
292,0.97,1569.467,1585.083,"Vendors are required to offer reduced fare plans . The exact structure of the plan varies by fender, but we cap it at $1.50 per hour.",40,,
293,0.97,1585.083,1598.697,"We found that reduced fare riders took over 67,000 trips, which is about 4.5% of total trips.",40,,
294,0.97,1598.697,1602.767,"They averaged many more trips per rider, 64 trips for the rider per year compared to just three overall.",40,,
295,0.97,1602.767,1605.837,You can see the unique users who have signed up by fender on the right there.,40,,
296,0.97,1605.837,1608.44,It is at least 400 people if there is overlap.,40,,
297,0.97,1608.44,1615.914,Next slide?,40,,
298,0.97,1615.914,1617.983,We do outreach with community partners.,40,,
299,0.97,1617.983,1625.29,We provided outreach to Bipoc communities.,40,,
300,0.97,1625.29,1638.169,"This is something we will work on next year, addressing those barriers . Some of those included lack of knowledge on how to use Scooters.",40,,
301,0.97,1638.169,1641.039,People are concerned about access to helmets and having a safe place to ride.,40,,
302,0.97,1641.039,1648.079,"Affordability was a concern, as well as some language access needs.",40,,
303,0.97,1648.079,1679.21,"We also in coordination with those community organizations and the vendors, we held outreach events . This included giving away helmets, hands-on Instructionãwhich I think makes a really big difference for people in getting more comfortable with Scooters, and we allowed people to sign up for reduced their plans--fare plans at those events.",40,,
304,0.97,1679.21,1680.912,Another key component of our program is Adaptive Cycling.,40,,
305,0.97,1680.912,1691.623,"One major way we do this is that we partner with outdoors for all, an existing nonprofit organization in Seattle that has 200 bicycles in their fleet that are adapted.",40,,
306,0.97,1691.623,1694.959,Our funds allowed them to offer programming for free and with expanded hours during summer months.,40,,
307,0.97,1694.959,1702.534,"Council, thank you for providing additional funding for this program to expand even more next year.",40,,
308,0.97,1702.534,1712.777,"Another piece of accessibility was our priority for having the seated Scooter option, gives people just an additional way to get around that we think is more comfortable for certain users.",40,,
309,0.97,1712.777,1714.245,Next slide?,40,,
310,0.97,1714.245,1716.915,"Next, we will get into the safety pieces.",40,,
311,0.97,1716.915,1726.324,We had vendors implement various safety requirements.,40,,
312,0.97,1726.324,1730.729,You can see on the right there is a picture of the required safety quiz that Pops up before your first ride.,40,,
313,0.97,1730.729,1741.906,"We also require that they reduce speeds on the first ride, so it is capped at eight miles per hour as people get more comfortable with using them.",40,,
314,0.97,1741.906,1743.775,We implemented a requirement that Scooter riders wear helmets.,40,,
315,0.97,1743.775,1754.352,"However, we found that 70% of people reported that they never or almost never wear helmets.",40,,
316,0.97,1754.352,1760.759,"The number one reason for that is people reporting that they did not want to carry that around, as well as some people saying they did not own at helmet.",40,,
317,0.97,1760.759,1766.097,We also don't allow sidewalk writing unless circumstances dictate.,40,,
318,0.97,1766.097,1778.877,"In our survey, we found that 73% of people said they wrote it in the street and bike lanes or on bike paths, which are allowed.",40,,
319,0.97,1778.877,1781.312,22% said they wrote most of their last trip on the sidewalk.,40,,
320,0.97,1781.312,1785.316,Most users said the reason they chose where they rode depended on what felt safest for them.,40,,
321,0.97,1785.316,1788.486,Next slide?,40,,
322,0.97,1788.486,1802.667,"The safety, another key piece is looking at injuries and fatalities.",40,,
323,0.97,1803.568,1805.27,One source we have for this is police reports.,40,,
324,0.97,1805.27,1806.571,We look for Scooter related issues.,40,,
325,0.97,1806.571,1809.908,We don't necessarily know on these whether they were related to Scooter share or privately owned Scooters.,40,,
326,0.97,1809.908,1811.643,We found that there were 17 Scooter related collisions.,40,,
327,0.97,1811.643,1815.513,"Unfortunately, there was one fatality this passed October on airport way South.",40,,
328,0.97,1815.513,1832.063,All injuries and the fatality involves a Scooter collision with a motor vehicle.,40,,
329,0.97,1832.063,1834.165,Our user survey also got a lot of safety information.,40,,
330,0.97,1834.165,1835.967,This is another key source of data for us.,40,,
331,0.97,1835.967,1840.471,We ask that people have been injured in any way using a Scooter and if they had medical care of any kind.,40,,
332,0.97,1840.471,1844.742,We found that 2.6% of users said they had sought some form of medical care for a Scooter related injury.,40,,
333,0.97,1844.742,1849.981,"We are getting more into the data, where he asked people to describe their entries more.",40,,
334,0.97,1849.981,1852.083,We will have more information to share about that later.,40,,
335,0.97,1852.083,1859.257,I think this survey is capturing a wider net than we might get from data that only looks at E.R.,40,,
336,0.97,1859.257,1859.49,Visits.,40,,
337,0.97,1859.49,1862.293,It is looking at a lot of different kinds of entries.,40,,
338,0.97,1862.293,1870.401,We don't have comparable data to other modes or other cities who have done similar surveys yet.,40,,
339,0.97,1870.401,1870.702,Next slide?,40,,
340,0.97,1870.702,1907.272,"Techie, if I may, just lift up the point we heard from a public comment or about hospital data, can you clarify the next layer you are going to uncover in terms of getting to the bottom of the safety issue to make sure that we can no what the trends are in no whether we need to be doing things differently?",41,,
341,0.97,1907.272,1919.05,I think the immediate next step is we need to get more from our existing survey about the types of injuries people are describing.,42,,
342,0.97,1919.05,1922.053,That will help tell us more about what to do next.,42,,
343,0.97,1922.053,1931.729,We had been planning to work with University of Washington and Harborview on the emergency room side of things.,42,,
344,0.97,1931.729,1940.571,Those staff no longer had room to work with us because of the Covid pandemic.,42,,
345,0.97,1940.571,1942.874,That is something we would hope to do in the future.,42,,
346,0.97,1942.874,1944.609,"Not sure how that would look like, exactly.",42,,
347,0.97,1944.609,1950.281,It would be interesting for us to try to get at what this number will look like for other modes.,42,,
348,0.97,1950.281,1952.483,I don't know if we have plans to do that just yet.,42,,
349,0.97,1952.483,1980.812,"If other cities are doing that, I realize the Covid pandemic has made it difficult, but if other cities are collecting that data, I would encourage that . It is also a fair point in terms of getting similar data from other modes and tracking that over time to see what the trends are, comparing that to other cities and their programs.",43,,
350,0.97,1980.812,1987.418,I was disappointed when we were not able to partner with Harborview on that study.,43,,
351,0.97,1987.418,1998.129,"I look forward to, as soon as we can, getting that information from hospitals and how it impacts other modes, as well.",43,,

353,0.97,1998.629,2005.103,Thank you.,44,,
354,0.97,2005.103,2012.143,"I was going to hold my question until the end, but giving that we are asking some, chair Pedersen, I want to see if I could do the same, if that is all right.",44,,
355,0.97,2012.143,2022.353,"I want to underscore the point that you are making, chair Pedersen, 2.6% of Scooter users reporting an injury.",44,,
356,0.97,2022.353,2025.456,I think that works out to about one out of 40 users?,44,,
357,0.97,2025.456,2046.144,"To figure out whether or not that is alarming, and it kind of sounds like it is, it would be good to compare it to Cycling and walking per number of trips to get a sense of that.",44,,
358,0.97,2046.144,2080.912,"Regarding the rider experience slide, slide 19, the 22% of folks who are riding on the sidewalk for most of their trip, I understand you are explaining that folks are making choices based on what is safest, and in making the choice to ride on the sidewalk, you are making a choice that seems like it is safer for you as the Scooter rider, but you are making the sidewalks less safe for other people who are using them.",44,,
359,0.97,2080.912,2088.853,I don't think that is the right choice that riders should be making.,44,,
360,0.97,2088.853,2091.289,I am wondering what we are doing to address that.,44,,
361,0.97,2091.289,2108.773,"If people are moving to the sidewalk because it is safer, it seems like Maybe they should be encouraged to walk their trip for that portion of the trip . I just want to know more about that.",44,,
362,0.97,2108.773,2115.48,I have a lot of concerns with motorized wheel vehicles on our sidewalks.,44,,
363,0.97,2115.48,2145.343,"I have expressed that over years of our developing and implementing this program . I continue to have concerns about the impacts to pedestrians, particularly folks who have mobility issues . sidewalks are called sidewalks because they are for walking.",44,,
364,0.97,2145.343,2145.977,Thank you.,44,,
365,0.97,2145.977,2151.182,"Yeah, I can go ahead and provide some thoughts on that.",45,,
366,0.97,2151.182,2154.085,I agree it is a concern.,45,,
367,0.97,2154.085,2169.5,"I think we want to do more education next year, some for users and also Nonusers, with Messaging about not riding on the sidewalk.",45,,
368,0.97,2169.5,2187.218,I think your point about potentially specifically saying you should walk your Scooter while you are on the sidewalk if you need to be there is potentially a good message that we could use.,45,,
369,0.97,2187.218,2188.519,There are some additional technology solutions.,45,,
370,0.97,2188.519,2197.795,We are seeing good things out of the data we are seeing from spin and their artificial intelligence technology that can detect sidewalk writing.,45,,
371,0.97,2197.795,2203.034,We saw in their initial data that sidewalk writing went down as people took more trips on spin.,45,,
372,0.97,2203.034,2205.836,That is sort of reinforcing the message.,45,,
373,0.97,2205.836,2213.844,I think that was about all I have at this point.,45,,
374,0.97,2213.844,2216.747,Thank you.,46,,
375,0.97,2216.747,2222.353,Please continue.,46,,
376,0.97,2222.353,2231.362,Another key piece of sidewalk safety is keeping sidewalks clear from parked devices.,47,,
377,0.97,2231.362,2238.169,We regularly conduct Audits of how devices are parked.,47,,
378,0.97,2238.169,2246.444,"We think establishing some designated parking areas, which we did a bunch last year and we put them near certain stations.",47,,
379,0.97,2246.444,2253.584,There are a couple across this the street from the Roosevelt station.,47,,
380,0.97,2253.584,2260.324,We have work to do in terms of encouraging proper parking behavior.,47,,
381,0.97,2260.324,2269.7,"You can see on our chart, quarter over quarter, we had our best yet in Q3, 2021.",47,,
382,0.97,2269.7,2272.803,We got down to 8% of devices overall that were considered obstructions.,47,,
383,0.97,2272.803,2276.307,"Our target is 3%, which is an aggressive target.",47,,
384,0.97,2276.307,2285.716,"There is more education to be done with that, as well as potential technology solutions to help people parked devices correctly.",47,,

390,0.97,2323.054,2336.267,"Over half of trips start or end near a frequent transit stop, which I think is partially people connecting to transit.",47,,
391,0.97,2336.267,2338.169,We will learn more in our survey about that.,47,,
392,0.97,2338.169,2343.941,Those are also the neighborhoods where there are a lot of Scooters and places to go.,47,,
393,0.97,2343.941,2351.382,"Finally, we found that 24% of Scooter users said they would have used a personal vehicle for their last Scooter trip if they had not used a Scooter.",47,,

397,0.97,2361.459,2362.86,What are the key Takeaways?,47,,
398,0.97,2362.86,2365.996,People are riding Scooters.,47,,
399,0.97,2365.996,2376.707,We think they're using them for various types of trips.,47,,
400,0.97,2376.707,2378.309,We saw pretty good use even in a pandemic.,47,,
401,0.97,2378.309,2381.212,"On places that had Scooters before the pandemic, they saw a big tip.",47,,
402,0.97,2381.212,2383.514,He started during a pandemic and have seen pretty steady growth.,47,,
403,0.97,2383.514,2397.628,We need to continue to have expanded access in terms of who has access and feels comfortable using Scooters.,47,,
404,0.97,2397.628,2398.963,We need to look at Affordability.,47,,
405,0.97,2398.963,2409.407,"While there have been some injuries and collisions and we plan to continue to improve education about safety, we have seen device parking improve over time.",47,,
406,0.97,2409.407,2411.509,There is still more we need to do on that.,47,,
407,0.97,2411.509,2415.746,"Just overall, we think that Scooters provided climate friendly options that Complemented our bike share and transit system.",47,,

411,0.97,2426.457,2440.304,Then we plan to have a competitive process to select Scooter vendors for the future.,47,,
412,0.97,2446.811,2452.116,"We will continue our audit program, looking for parking obstructions in particular as well as collecting more data on how much sidewalk writing is happening.",47,,
413,0.97,2452.116,2453.584,We started to do that this year.,47,,
414,0.97,2453.584,2458.923,There is room to collect more data to better understand what is happening and if there are specific areas we need to target for additional Messaging.,47,,
415,0.97,2458.923,2469.066,"As I mentioned, we are planning to expand public awareness Úcampaigns as well as get Helme use up.",47,,
416,0.97,2469.066,2474.104,A piece of that is getting helmets into the hands of people as well as reinforcing the message that people should be wearing helmets.,47,,
417,0.97,2474.104,2478.576,We plan to continue our education in equity focused communities and expand that in the future.,47,,

435,0.97,3115.345,3128.058,"While we know some limited testing happening outside of Seattle's limits, these devices are starting to gain in popularity around the country, especially seeing them in Coastal California and around college campuses.",48,,
436,0.97,3128.058,3138.468,They tend to be used for things like food delivery or small package deliveries in a very small radius.,48,,
437,0.97,3138.468,3168.198,"Finally for today, we are also monitoring drones and what is known as unmanned aerial mobility . This air travel, either delivery by drones or passenger transport through an automated aerial device, has been gaining Traction is the concept across the country, especially in California, where this promise of aerial passenger travel is very compelling given the congested roadways down there.",48,,
438,0.97,3168.198,3184.314,"While this space will probably be regulated heavily by Federal Airspace roles, Sdot is still monitoring this industry, especially with regard to regional interests and the technology that is evolving in this space.",48,,

494,0.97,3549.646,3561.958,Part of our required communication is to specifically layout what our responsibilities are as the auditors.,53,,
495,0.97,3561.958,3568.665,We are responsible for forming and expressing an opinion on whether the financial statements are prepared in material respects with generally accepted accounting standards.,53,,
496,0.97,3568.665,3572.769,I like to point out that what we are focusing in on is there material respects.,53,,
497,0.97,3572.769,3584.581,That would be what we said as something that somebody using the financial statements might consider when they are making decisions.,53,,
498,0.97,3584.581,3595.525,Our Audits are set up using statistical sampling to provide reasonable and not absolute assurance.,53,,
499,0.97,3595.525,3597.226,There is always that caveat.,53,,

501,0.97,3624.754,3626.889,"That being said, we are responsible to communicate any significant matters.",53,,
502,0.97,3626.889,3635.965,"As we go through that stuff, even if it may not be deemed material, if we think it is significant enough that it should be communicated to you as the governing body, we will be bringing that up in the exit presentation, as well.",53,,
503,0.97,3635.965,3642.839,The audit of the financial statements does not relieve management or you have your responsibility for the operation and oversight of Spu.,53,,
504,0.97,3642.839,3653.082,"Finally, as I mentioned, we take a risk based approach to our audit plan.",53,,
505,0.97,3653.082,3661.891,Our procedures are not designed specifically for identifying those other matters to be communicated to you.,53,,
506,0.97,3661.891,3674.904,"However, when we find them, they will be communicated.",53,,
507,0.97,3674.904,3682.512,Completed our audit planning in November.,53,,
508,0.97,3682.512,3684.213,"In December, we started our interim audit procedures.",53,,
509,0.97,3684.213,3686.883,So getting comfortable with the controls at Spu and the I.T.,53,,
510,0.97,3686.883,3696.492,Systems and then moving forward to right now our entrance conference with the committee.,53,,
511,0.97,3696.492,3706.302,We will take a little bit of a break after the end of the year so that the Spu staff can close out the books and get everything Fine-Tuned and ready for us to look at.,53,,
512,0.97,3706.302,3720.149,"We will come out in a March or April time frame, where we do the majority of our stance of testing, making sure all the balances are supported and really getting comfortable with our audit work.",53,,
513,0.97,3720.149,3725.054,We finalize the audit report by April 30.,53,,
514,0.97,3725.054,3732.028,"In May, we have our exit conferences both with management and with Council.",53,,
515,0.97,3732.028,3736.065,I will turn it over to Laurie.,53,,
516,0.97,3736.065,3751.414,"To continue on with Todd's comment, we covered the scope of the entire financial statements and all of the accounts of the utilities.",54,,
517,0.97,3751.414,3758.621,"I do want to draw your attention to where we believe the most significant and most accounts that contain risk, which is where we spend most of our time in conducting the audit.",54,,
518,0.97,3758.621,3771.801,"Of course, starting off with utility plans, so the assets, whether those are self constructed or purchased or existing assets.",54,,
519,0.97,3771.801,3776.506,We do spend a lot of time on the internal controls around that.,54,,
520,0.97,3776.506,3781.611,We actually do interview program managers for the self constructed assets.,54,,
521,0.97,3781.611,3782.712,We look at the construction.,54,,
522,0.97,3782.712,3786.182,"We look at when those are closed into capital assets, if it is self constructed.",54,,
523,0.97,3786.182,3791.42,We look at those vendor purchases and all the systems that flow into utility plans.,54,,
524,0.97,3791.42,3795.091,"That is a big part of our audit, the heart of our audit.",54,,
525,0.97,3795.091,3801.497,"Bonded debt, definitely an important balance.",54,,
526,0.97,3801.497,3810.173,"You have Stakeholders who are very interested, bondholders who are very interested that those are accounted for properly.",54,,
527,0.97,3810.173,3811.541,Accounting for bonds can be very complex.,54,,
528,0.97,3811.541,3824.053,"So we do look at that very closely, not only new Issuances or Re-Fundings of debt, but also the existing debt and the amortization Paydown of that existing debt.",54,,
529,0.97,3824.053,3832.461,Environmental liabilities is always a big issue and risk in any utility.,54,,
530,0.97,3832.461,3843.072,That encompasses any pollution remediation obligations or claims or any State or federal regulatory bindings that are interested in potential sites that you may have on your books.,54,,
531,0.97,3843.072,3850.546,"Of course, there are a lot of shared accounts in this area with not only Seattle city light, but the city of Seattle.",54,,
532,0.97,3850.546,3856.586,So we do look at the Seattle public utilities share of the responsibility for those liabilities.,54,,
533,0.97,3856.586,3865.194,Unique to utilities is regulatory accounting.,54,,
534,0.97,3865.194,3873.202,There are a lot of mechanisms that are available to utilities to defer charges and match them against the rates that are coming in the future.,54,,
535,0.97,3873.202,3885.481,"So we do look very closely at the layers of those deferred charges or those deferred credits, including any capitalized interest that may be accruing.",54,,
536,0.97,3885.481,3891.821,"Of course, every single audit lists revenues as a risk.",54,,
537,0.97,3891.821,3911.641,We look very closely at the preceding cycle and the controls around those and how the buildings and invoices and cycles make their way into the financial statements for the revenues.,54,,
538,0.97,3911.641,3925.955,"Expenses again, the other side of the coin, looking at your cash disbursements and your vendors, your payable systems, and getting control reliance and getting a lot of our audit insurance from looking at the controls around both of those operating revenues and operating expenses.",54,,
539,0.97,3925.955,3931.16,Todd mentioned briefly that we have a separate team that is trained specifically in general computer controls.,54,,
540,0.97,3931.16,3937.466,We do look very closely and of course we have to coordinate that with the city of Seattle with their I.T.,54,,
541,0.97,3937.466,3938.434,Department.,54,,
542,0.97,3938.434,3948.945,That is a large percentage of our audit time . It is devoted to the information technology controls.,54,,
543,0.97,3948.945,3954.583,That is combined with the financial statement internal controls to give us that audit assurance that we need to sign the opinion.,54,,
544,0.97,3954.583,3964.46,We are just coming out of our work on the internal controls and planning.,54,,
545,0.97,3964.46,3972.134,Now we are going to work to develop our final audit plan based on the results of our testing.,54,,
546,0.97,3972.134,3975.104,We will be back again in March to do the bulk of our work.,54,,
547,0.97,3975.104,3981.477,One thing I do want to bring up is consideration of fraud in any audit.,54,,
548,0.97,3981.477,3995.157,It is our responsibility as the auditor to obtain reasonable assurance that your financial statements as a whole are free of any type of material Misstatement.,54,,
549,0.97,3995.157,3997.426,That is whether it is caused by an error or intentional fraud.,54,,
550,0.97,3997.426,4002.198,"We do have some procedures in place in our audit to address this, although we don't design the audit to look for fraud.",54,,
551,0.97,4002.198,4009.739,We certainly do design the audit to try to identify any risks of material Misstatement.,54,,
552,0.97,4009.739,4017.913,We have a lot of procedures around the internal controls.,54,,
553,0.97,4017.913,4021.617,"We do actually Brainstorm as an audit team on, Hey, how can we poke holes at this system?",54,,
554,0.97,4021.617,4026.155,Is there a way we could think of that somebody could get through and try to Perpetrate a fraud?,54,,
555,0.97,4026.155,4047.443,"We also conduct interviews throughout all of Seattle public utilities, not just the accounting and Finance Department, not just the program managers that we are talking to about constructed assets, but throughout the organization to determine if people understand the code of conduct, if they understand internal controls.",54,,
556,0.97,4047.443,4051.28,Does it feel like the tone at the top is appropriate to prevent the risk of fraud?,54,,
557,0.97,4051.28,4058.788,Those are things that we certainly consider during our audit.,54,,
558,0.97,4058.788,4090.119,"Before I finish up with a couple of other informational items, I do want to take the time to pause for questions and find out if any of you have any concerns . do you have any comments with respect to the attitudes, awareness about internal controls at Seattle public utilities, any awareness of communications between Spu and the type of regulators, anything that you would like to comment to us now?",54,,
559,0.97,4090.119,4097.026,We would like to take that into account for our audit plan.,54,,
560,0.97,4097.026,4100.796,Thank you.,55,,
561,0.97,4100.796,4110.239,"I think just big picture, the tone at the top here is we obviously want to have these thorough Audits done as they are normally.",55,,
562,0.97,4110.239,4136.432,"We recognize that this is a $1 billion enterprise that delivers clean water to hundreds of thousands of people and removes waste and it is very important towards the functioning of any city, particularly are where elected officials are involved directly, not only in general government, but in overseeing Seattle public utilities as well as Seattle city light for electricity.",55,,
563,0.97,4136.432,4152.615,We are glad that you are here to do this opening with us on the audit for 2021.,55,,
564,0.97,4153.015,4154.717,And you do have our contact information.,56,,
565,0.97,4154.717,4159.088,"I would encourage you if you have questions or concerns that arise in the next few months, don't hesitate to reach out.",56,,
566,0.97,4159.088,4160.89,Thank you.,57,,
567,0.97,4160.89,4171.1,"So last couple of informational items that I want to go over, I did want to let you know of an audit standard that relates to documents containing the audited financial statements.",58,,
568,0.97,4171.1,4194.223,"If our report is used in any type of document such as an annual report or a bond issuance, we do request that you read that document to make sure there is nothing inconsistent in the document that would be different or inconsistent with our report and with the audited financial statements.",58,,
569,0.97,4194.223,4199.595,"We do have a good relationship with management when they are ready for a new bond issue, for example.",58,,
570,0.97,4199.595,4202.831,We do get the preliminary document in advance.,58,,
571,0.97,4202.831,4204.833,We read it.,58,,
572,0.97,4204.833,4215.11,We are reading it to make sure there is nothing in there that would be inconsistent with the financial statements themselves or our audit opinion.,58,,
573,0.97,4215.11,4218.147,I just wanted to let you know that that does occur.,58,,
574,0.97,4218.147,4221.65,There has been a flurry of new auditing standards released lately.,58,,
575,0.97,4221.65,4234.163,"Nothing that you will probably notice, but it is changing the format and some of the wording in our audit reports.",58,,
576,0.97,4234.163,4239.535,There are some additional requirements on what we need to communicate with you at the end of the audit.,58,,
577,0.97,4239.535,4242.104,"Again, I don't think that any of you will notice much difference.",58,,
578,0.97,4242.104,4248.877,It is really more for the auditors and the way we are wording our report.,58,,
579,0.97,4248.877,4251.18,More to come on that when we report out in May.,58,,
580,0.97,4251.18,4256.885,I will be able to report out at that point how the opinion paragraph and some of the wording in the report has changed from prior years.,58,,
581,0.97,4256.885,4270.799,"It will still be an unmodified or unqualified opinion, which will still be very apparent to the reader.",58,,
582,0.97,4270.799,4277.573,"That was the whole point, to clean up the language so it is a little more User-Friendly to the users and the Stakeholders of the audit reports.",58,,
583,0.97,4277.573,4281.477,There has also been a large flurry of accounting developments.,58,,
584,0.97,4281.477,4282.478,I have three pages here.,58,,
585,0.97,4282.478,4288.617,I am not going to go through all of these.,58,,
586,0.97,4288.617,4291.153,That is mainly because most of them don't apply to Seattle public utilities.,58,,
587,0.97,4291.153,4306.035,But I want you to see the whole universe of these new accounting standards that have come out that are going to be applicable over the next few years.,58,,
588,0.97,4306.035,4308.837,The ones that are important to Seattle public utilities are on this first slide.,58,,
589,0.97,4308.837,4316.211,The leases standard is a pretty big change in the way that lease assets or liabilities are accounted for.,58,,
590,0.97,4316.211,4320.549,They will be brought onto the balance sheet as opposed to expenses incurred.,58,,
591,0.97,4320.549,4323.752,This is not effective until 2022.,58,,
592,0.97,4323.752,4330.059,"But of course, 2022 starts in a few weeks.",58,,
593,0.97,4330.059,4336.799,We will be working with management even during the conduct of our audit of 2021 to help them with the implementation.,58,,
594,0.97,4336.799,4338.667,They have to give an inventory of their leases.,58,,
595,0.97,4338.667,4345.774,They have to figure out what may need to start to be capitalized onto the balance sheet as opposed to Expensed.,58,,
596,0.97,4345.774,4347.843,Will be working with them for a smooth transition.,58,,
597,0.97,4347.843,4359.688,"When we come back in a year, we will talk about how that will be implemented in 2022.",58,,
598,0.97,4359.688,4361.123,"So nothing yet, but that is coming.",58,,
599,0.97,4361.123,4364.793,"The other interesting one for Seattle public utilities is Gasb 89, the accounting for interest cost.",58,,
600,0.97,4364.793,4374.47,"Very recently until this standard, when you had a self constructed asset, you were Equired to actually capitalize any interest costs that were related to that.",58,,
601,0.97,4374.47,4389.418,"If you issued bonds to help pay for new infrastructure related to the water utility, for example, that interest cost would become part of the asset on the balance sheet.",58,,
602,0.97,4389.418,4391.22,This standard took that away.,58,,
603,0.97,4391.22,4399.395,Now interest costs are Expensed.,58,,
604,0.97,4399.395,4403.232,"However, you heard me mention earlier that utilities have some very unique accounting mechanisms available to them.",58,,
605,0.97,4403.232,4411.84,"In this case, this is one that was available where any municipal utility is allowed to invoke regulatory accounting.",58,,
606,0.97,4411.84,4415.544,You can continue to capitalize interest.,58,,
607,0.97,4415.544,4426.855,"Because interest costs are such a big part of your self constructed asset, this is something that a lot of large municipal utilities are doing.",58,,
608,0.97,4426.855,4428.223,They are invoking this regulatory account.,58,,
609,0.97,4428.223,4445.24,"All that really means is that you know that this asset that you are creating, you are going to recover the cost of that asset over that period of time.",58,,
610,0.97,4445.24,4448.277,"It may be a bond issue that takes 30 years to amortize out, to pay back.",58,,
611,0.97,4448.277,4455.484,"But the life of the asset you build might be 30, 40, 50 years.",58,,
612,0.97,4455.484,4467.162,This is a very good example of why the matching principle exists and why utilities are allowed to invoke regulatory accounting so they can better match rate revenue that they are going to get in the future against the expenses that they are incurring today.,58,,
613,0.97,4467.162,4470.566,"We completely agree, this was an appropriate thing to do for Seattle public utilities.",58,,
614,0.97,4470.566,4480.108,"Again, they will continue to capitalize interest to their projects.",58,,
615,0.97,4480.108,4484.58,"So no change, but it is unique because, again, if you are not a utility, you cannot invoke this type of accounting.",58,,
616,0.97,4484.58,4493.322,I did want to point that out to you in case you are talking with your friends about accounting standards and you wonder why they are still capitalizing interest.,58,,
617,0.97,4493.388,4495.39,His is why.,58,,
618,0.97,4495.39,4498.827,That is the main one.,58,,
619,0.97,4498.827,4511.34,"The rest of them, and Todd, if you want to quickly through the next couple of pages, the rest of the standards either have no impact to Seattle public utilities or very minor.",58,,
620,0.97,4511.34,4514.042,They will be assessing those to determine.,58,,
621,0.97,4514.042,4521.049,"Again, I would say the vast majority of these actually do not have any applicability to the utility.",58,,
622,0.97,4521.049,4529.658,"So with that, that is the end of our discussion of our audit plan.",58,,
623,0.97,4529.658,4531.326,"Again, I am happy to take questions now.",58,,
624,0.97,4531.326,4539.301,"If you think of something in January or February or March, please don't hesitate to contact us.",58,,
625,0.97,4539.301,4544.64,We can set the meeting and go over it with you.,58,,
626,0.97,4544.64,4546.675,Thank you very much for being here this morning.,59,,
627,0.97,4546.675,4551.847,"Again, it is really important with both the utilities enterprises that we have to have these Audits.",59,,
628,0.97,4551.847,4578.04,"I will be interested to see, one of the things unique to Washington state is the So- called utility tax, where the municipal corporation contacts the utility--10 tax the utility.",59,,
629,0.97,4582.844,4591.153,"Even though they are revenues, we convert them into revenue and use it for different things for general city government.",59,,
630,0.97,4591.153,4593.822,That is something that seems unique to Washington state.,59,,
631,0.97,4593.822,4596.191,I do want to thank you for this.,59,,
632,0.97,4596.191,4601.33,"Councilmembers, any questions for the independent auditors while we have them?",59,,
633,0.97,4601.33,4608.136,"If not, they are open to being contacted during their audit process, as well.",59,,
634,0.97,4608.136,4610.138,Thank you for being here.,59,,
635,0.97,4610.138,4612.04,We appreciate it.,59,,
636,0.97,4612.04,4614.643,That was our last item.,59,,
637,0.97,4614.643,4639.968,"In case the viewing public did not see this, Council President Gonzalez, even though we were talking about auditing standards and accounting, the intensity and attention even in the last meeting here on this item is another piece of evidence about how much she cares about our city on any item.",59,,
638,0.97,4639.968,4644.473,"Council President, I think this is your last committee meeting officially?",59,,
639,0.97,4644.473,4656.184,I know we already had our heartfelt Goodbyes.,59,,
640,0.97,4656.184,4659.454,All of our Council colleagues joined in presenting a proclamation honoring you and your team.,59,,
641,0.97,4659.454,4662.958,I want to say again what an honor it has been to work with you as our President.,59,,
642,0.97,4662.958,4668.463,I have always enjoyed and appreciated our conversations with your strategic leadership.,59,,
643,0.97,4668.463,4685.047,"And your generosity, being forthright about your positions and explaining them, even if we are coming at an issue from a different angle, I have always valued those discussions.",59,,
644,0.97,4685.047,4688.684,I look forward to any opportunity to work with you in the future.,59,,
645,0.97,4688.684,4702.931,"If you want to say a few words here, at the tail end of this audit discussion of the Spu, I welcome that.",59,,
646,0.97,4702.931,4703.198,Sure.,60,,
647,0.97,4703.198,4704.032,"Thank you, chair Pedersen.",60,,
648,0.97,4704.032,4710.138,It has been a pleasure to serve on this committee under your leadership.,60,,
649,0.97,4710.138,4715.744,"It is a big committee with lots of really important issues related to all of our utilities, as we just heard from this really important audit.",60,,
650,0.97,4715.744,4722.017,That is what keeps the lights on and the water flowing to the homes of people.,60,,
651,0.97,4722.017,4725.921,It deals with basic services like trash pickup and recycling and compost.,60,,
652,0.97,4725.921,4743.772,I really appreciate how much you have been able to get through the committee over the last two years.,60,,
653,0.97,4743.772,4748.91,"I appreciate your thoughtful approach to all the critical work related to transportation, which has a huge impact on our climate change goals, of course.",60,,
