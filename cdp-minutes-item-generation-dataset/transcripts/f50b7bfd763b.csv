5,0.97,1161.093,1161.627,"All right, Amy.",1,,
6,0.97,1161.627,1183.148,"One thing that's a little bit different about the Hsd budget is that I think there was a concerted effort to expand funding at Hisd, compared to a lot of other departments, which is good news, and I'd say there aren't quite as many cuts in the Hisd budget.",2,,
7,0.97,1183.148,1188.253,So the final slides are the budget actions proposed by Council members.,2,,

15,0.97,1232.03,1250.082,"As it relates to the proposal to restore funding to age friendly Seattle, the age friendly team was formed following the closure of the Mayor's office for senior citizens to implement the age friendly Seattle action plan.",4,,
16,0.97,1250.082,1266.965,"This team handles implementation, oversight, and evaluation of an action plan to increase racial equity, reduce displacement, increase social participation, and raise awareness about the challenges and opportunities that accompany Seattle's aging population.",4,,

18,0.97,1272.738,1277.743,So this cut amounts to 11% of their total budget.,4,,

26,0.97,1323.221,1336.601,"So I really appreciate you bringing this forward and talking about how it is still an appropriate program, even in this sort of Online social distancing age, and perhaps even more important.",5,,

57,0.97,1537.068,1542.04,It starts with families and licenses due to a high burden of paperwork and training.,8,,
58,0.97,1542.04,1557.989,"During this time of crisis, we're hoping to provide access to a child's cultural, and tribal identity, so supplemental funding would help us recruit, and reach more children and connect them to their heritage.",8,,
59,0.97,1557.989,1598.296,"I should add that our new, first ever native American Washington state Supreme Court justice Raquell Lewis penned ever opinions for the Indian Ed welfare act, and I would encourage my colleagues to take a look at it, because of the historical perspective and the analysis of why it's important to have people in positions of power and authority that look like us, live like us, and have the same life experience, can look at Anglo law, and look at policies they're affecting, Ie native American children and their families.",8,,

70,0.97,1622.354,1635.5,"Amy, you mentioned as part of your introduction of item number 3 that some of these items may end up not being N Hd at the end of the day.",13,,
71,0.97,1635.5,1671.169,"I think with regard to the daybreak Star preschool programming, I just want to say first off that I obviously support continuing to support that particular program, I would also say that we've got to make sure that we are running through the ordinary processes over at deal as it relates to our Fec level funding.",13,,
72,0.97,1671.169,1677.075,That seems to me to be the most potential viable revenue source for that.,13,,
73,0.97,1677.075,1684.482,So I just want to make sure I go on record saying I hope we are connecting with the D.O.,13,,
74,0.97,1684.482,1702.734,"On this particular proposal, and getting their analysis on how this additional funding for daybreak will meet the standards and requirements of funding for the preschool program in particular.",13,,

76,0.97,1707.038,1709.607,We received that exact feedback from Hsd this morning.,14,,
77,0.97,1709.607,1714.746,And so that is the next step is reaching out to deal about that.,14,,
78,0.97,1714.746,1719.751,Thank you.,15,,
79,0.97,1719.751,1721.753,"Thank you, Council President.",16,,
80,0.97,1721.753,1722.22,Yeah.,16,,
81,0.97,1722.22,1736.134,"That is very helpful reminder, similar to our conversation yesterday about specific projects for Sdot, for example, I want to make sure it's run through the Prioritization Rec Fund.",16,,
82,0.97,1736.134,1759.858,"I would also just really quickly, because number 4, I think has a similar issue, in terms of it being under Hsd, the Fep levee did have some portions of it, as authorized by the voters of Seattle to allow for a specific amount of funding available for capital projects related to Childcare centers.",17,,
83,0.97,1759.858,1768.266,So I just want to also highlight that I think this one is Additionally potentially Miscategorized.,17,,
84,0.97,1768.266,1776.708,And would like to make sure that Council central staff is going to connect with D.O.,17,,
85,0.97,1776.708,1780.778,About item number 4 as well.,17,,

89,0.97,1798.963,1806.838,I would note that we'll absolutely reach out to deal about if there are appropriate funds for this deal.,19,,
90,0.97,1806.838,1816.815,There is also 3.9 million in the Hsd budget for Childcare funding that is funded through the incentive zoning bonus program.,19,,
91,0.97,1816.815,1827.692,So those are two options that we can continue to work with the sponsor who is Councilmember Morales.,19,,

93,0.97,1829.794,1830.328,Thank you.,21,,
94,0.97,1830.328,1846.845,"So Yeah, this is I'm sure we all know, the Filipino community center is in the midst of another project that will provide 96 units of senior housing as well as an innovation learning center for young people.",21,,
95,0.97,1846.845,1855.553,This request would be to help fund the development of a Childcare center on a neighboring parcel.,21,,
96,0.97,1855.553,1876.074,"So just to Councilmember President Gonzales' point, we are working with the Filipino community center to identify what the right sources of funding might be at the city level, and then also working with them at the state level to see if we can help advocate for some state level capital to finish this project up.",21,,
97,0.97,1876.074,1890.321,"Well, to begin the project, and make sure that we see it come to fruition, so that they can provide some really desperately needed Childcare services in the neighborhood.",21,,
98,0.97,1890.321,1895.093,"Thank you, very much Councilmember Morales.",22,,
99,0.97,1895.093,1901.466,"Just a quick question on this, given the current construction that's happening.",22,,
100,0.97,1901.466,1906.437,"This is specific for capital projects, correct?",22,,
101,0.97,1906.437,1908.139,"Go ahead, Councilmember.",23,,
102,0.97,1908.139,1909.374,"Yeah, it is.",24,,

106,0.97,1923.254,1940.838,"And are looking at a neighboring parcel that is for sale, and the owner has indicated that they want to sell it to the Filipino community center for the purpose of this Childcare facility, so they are beginning the process of trying to acquire it.",24,,
107,0.97,1940.838,1948.479,"Great, and we had chat very briefly about identifying what potential state resources would be available for this.",25,,
108,0.97,1948.479,1951.249,We have that bigger picture as well.,25,,
109,0.97,1951.249,1951.482,Great.,25,,
110,0.97,1951.482,1954.285,"Okay, no additional questions on this item.",25,,

125,0.97,2043.174,2056.054,"There is a new approach from the approach that the Council was considering in the past, as it results.",28,,
126,0.97,2056.054,2071.502,"The ACLU Washington have a child proposal that does not rely on establishing a specific new location, so it's not a bricks and mortar proposal anymore, provide supervised consumption services.",28,,

128,0.97,2081.646,2109.173,"So I'm hoping we can take action to carry forward these funds, as part of the quarter for supplemental, and this action would transfer those carried forward funds in 2021 to Hsd and express the Council's intent with the Department of public health to fund this service in 2021.",28,,

134,0.97,2133.498,2148.446,"Just one other point that I should make is that at my committee briefing, we actually did have public health represented at the table, and they are also supportive of this new approach.",30,,

162,0.97,2321.252,2322.553,"Councilmember Sawant, please go ahead.",37,,
163,0.97,2322.553,2338.469,"As Amy said this would authorize the human services Department to extend its contract with community nonprofit organizations, such as Acls, for congregate meals and community activities from 2020 into 2021.",38,,
164,0.97,2338.469,2356.754,"Acrs acts as a fiscal sponsor for nine senior programs, the Vietnamese senior social, Laos senior Association.",38,,
165,0.97,2356.754,2360.791,Korean senior club.,38,,
166,0.97,2360.791,2362.46,"Tempo, and Club bamboo.",38,,
167,0.97,2362.46,2370.735,"In2020, Hisd provided some $126,000 to support congregate meals and certain cultural activities for the senior service served by these programs.",38,,
168,0.97,2370.735,2378.376,But those funds could not be used so we want to make sure that the funds can be carried over to 2021 use.,38,,
169,0.97,2378.376,2406.704,"I've had the honor of attending events organized by the Vietnamese senior Association multiple times, which is one of the nine senior organizations funded by Acls and it's obvious it's an incredibly important service for seniors to prevent depression, promote emotional wellness, and stay connected to their communities, in addition to funding vital needs like access to meals, and also transit.",38,,
170,0.97,2406.704,2415.946,"So they're anxiously looking forward to restart congregate meals and activities once it's safe to do so, and they're hoping at some point next year that will become possible.",38,,
171,0.97,2415.946,2422.787,So this budget would authorize the Department to use 2020 funds in 2021.,38,,
172,0.97,2422.787,2433.264,"Okay, this is a reminder, this morning, I mentioned there was a item that was inadvertently left off of our memo, and slides.",39,,
173,0.97,2433.264,2434.465,So this is that item.,39,,
174,0.97,2434.465,2437.301,"If you haven't had a chance to review it, let us know right now.",39,,
175,0.97,2437.301,2441.605,If you have any questions that you'd like to raise.,39,,
176,0.97,2441.605,2446.076,"Questions, colleagues?",39,,
177,0.97,2446.076,2446.277,Okay.,39,,
178,0.97,2446.277,2467.531,"Councilmember is a Sawant having worked in the senior assistance program where I ran many of the information assistance meal programs at various senior centers, I know that this is, it sounds similar to the programs that the AAA runs, area agency on aging.",39,,
179,0.97,2467.531,2473.07,How is this tied in with that bigger program?,39,,
180,0.97,2473.07,2480.911,"No doubt that they are tied in, in the sense that they provide some services, because these are age appropriate services.",40,,
181,0.97,2480.911,2481.946,I don't know specifics.,40,,
182,0.97,2481.946,2483.848,I'm happy to look into it.,40,,
183,0.97,2483.848,2508.105,"One thing I will say, just from having observed, especially the Vietnamese organizing from up close, is that these are very a part of what they offer, which really help the community members is that they are very ethnically appropriate, and culturally appropriate services.",40,,
184,0.97,2508.105,2516.247,"That's why Hirs works with many of these specific community organizations, but they all together benefit one another.",40,,
185,0.97,2516.247,2519.216,"Yes, please go ahead Amy.",41,,
186,0.97,2519.216,2528.692,I'll just mention that Hsd acts as the area age agency on aging and disability services for King County.,42,,
187,0.97,2528.692,2544.508,"So when these are funded through Hsd, it is through that entity, and we serve in that capacity, or Hsd serves in that capacity for the entirety of King County, which is why you receive programs, for example, the Cantanese group.",42,,
188,0.97,2544.508,2550.247,So sometimes the funding through there goes County wide as well.,42,,
189,0.97,2550.247,2551.215,"Great, Councilmember Herbold.",43,,
190,0.97,2551.215,2551.582,Thank you.,44,,
191,0.97,2551.582,2565.262,I would just like to understand a little bit more Logistically about what it means that the dollars were not used in 2026.,44,,
192,0.97,2565.262,2579.977,"Does that mean that those dollars were carry forward, in a carry forward ordinance, or were they just used for something else in the 2021 proposed budget?",44,,
193,0.97,2579.977,2584.848,I need to confirm exactly what happened in 2020.,45,,
194,0.97,2584.848,2597.261,But what we're hearing from Councilmember is a want Councilmember Sawant is that those funds were not able to be used in 2020.,45,,
195,0.97,2597.261,2608.439,"I need to work out what the mechanism is to make sure those funds are available in 2021, and I don't know yet if that has carried forward, or in addition to 2021.",45,,
196,0.97,2608.439,2608.806,Thank you.,46,,
197,0.97,2608.806,2611.642,I just want to signal my support for this budget action.,46,,
198,0.97,2611.642,2615.479,"Thank you for doing that, Councilmember Sawant.",47,,
199,0.97,2615.479,2622.019,"Thank you, Amy for providing the clarification, and thank you Councilmember Herbold for your support.",48,,
200,0.97,2622.019,2633.998,"So just to clarify what we know is that the funds have not been used yet, but I would really appreciate Amy working with my office, continuing to work with my office on that.",48,,
201,0.97,2633.998,2643.807,And what we know is that Acrs did ask Hsd if they could do a carry forward of these funds which were not used.,48,,
202,0.97,2643.807,2655.285,"But the Department have declined to do that, and so that's why we brought this document forward.",48,,
203,0.97,2655.285,2655.819,Excellent.,49,,
204,0.97,2655.819,2656.12,Thank you.,49,,
205,0.97,2656.12,2660.324,And thanks to central staff for working in this slide here today.,49,,
206,0.97,2660.324,2660.824,We appreciate that.,49,,
207,0.97,2660.824,2667.131,I think that that brings us to the end of our human services Department overview.,49,,
208,0.97,2667.131,2669.033,"Again, I'm not seeing any questions.",49,,
209,0.97,2669.033,2678.542,"Thanks, Amy, for walking us through this presentation along with Jeff and Aly.",49,,
210,0.97,2678.542,2689.92,"We do appreciate the full memo and if folks have questions about anything in the base proposal, as transmitted by the Mayor, please do make sure to reach out and ask us questions.",49,,
211,0.97,2689.92,2692.256,And you're free to ask them now too.,49,,
212,0.97,2692.256,2697.928,"Okay, not seeing any hands go up.",49,,
213,0.97,2697.928,2703.901,"Jeff, Amy, thanks so much, and we're going to move onto item number 3.",49,,
214,0.97,2703.901,2709.907,Homelessness response for briefing and discussion.,50,,
215,0.97,2709.907,2710.541,"Okay, wonderful.",51,,
216,0.97,2710.541,2711.108,Thank you so much.,51,,
217,0.97,2711.108,2715.179,I'm just going to turn it over to Jeff here.,51,,
218,0.97,2715.179,2717.514,I see you off of mute.,51,,
219,0.97,2717.514,2719.249,I can't find my script right away.,51,,
220,0.97,2719.249,2729.193,Maybe you can let us know who all is involved in this presentation today.,51,,
221,0.97,2729.193,2729.827,I see Brian Goodknight's name.,51,,
222,0.97,2729.827,2741.004,"Jeff Sims, counsel Straff, and I'll be joined by Brian Goodknight to discuss Seattle public utilities.",52,,
223,0.97,2741.004,2743.841,I think it will most be be just the two of us though.,52,,
224,0.97,2743.841,2747.377,We have some other central staffers ready to Chime in if necessary.,52,,
225,0.97,2747.377,2762.226,"To begin with, there is about a $42 million increase in homeless services throughout the city.",52,,
226,0.97,2762.226,2766.563,"That's covering every area of it, not just the Hisd.",52,,
227,0.97,2766.563,2772.336,"I will focus in first on Hsd, because it's difficult to see every single city Department all at once.",52,,
228,0.97,2772.336,2777.741,"So as you look through here, there's a number of places that you see there are some reductions.",52,,
229,0.97,2777.741,2785.649,"The primary one that I want to focus on, where you look at line G, outreach, that is primarily, I talked to Hsd about this.",52,,
230,0.97,2785.649,2790.754,"It is primarily the shifting of budget items, not actually a reduction to outreach contracts.",52,,
231,0.97,2790.754,2798.128,"So if you take what was provided in 2020, the majority of those contracts are getting their contract inflation.",52,,
232,0.97,2798.128,2804.768,The increases that are provided by the council as a result of this summer's budget actions are not maintained.,52,,
233,0.97,2804.768,2814.878,But you don't see those either in the 2020 adopted.,52,,
234,0.97,2814.878,2828.058,"It's just a Reshuffling of things, as Hsd gets ready to transfer contracts to the original authority on homelessness, and that causes a few places where you will see some budget.",52,,
235,0.97,2828.058,2829.326,If you turn to the next slide.,52,,
236,0.97,2829.326,2837.568,You can see the nature of the departments in Hsd is rolled into one line here.,52,,
237,0.97,2837.568,2847.844,"The primary thing is where the administrative services, there is a contract that has supported the navigation team, and that has moved to Seattle primary utilities.",52,,
238,0.97,2847.844,2852.516,"Otherwise, you see an overall increase in homelessness spending across all city departments.",52,,
239,0.97,2852.516,2868.131,"As you'll see in just a moment on the upcoming slides, the vast majority of that is one time funding related to Covid response, to expand services for people that are unsheltered.",52,,
240,0.97,2868.131,2870.2,"With that, the next item please.",52,,
241,0.97,2870.2,2874.204,This is a breakdown then of the primary changes that are going on in Hsd.,52,,
242,0.97,2874.204,2886.016,"As I mentioned, there's a lot of shuffling of budget programs, as we really get ready for the accounting pieces that need to make the arm authority possible.",52,,
243,0.97,2886.016,2889.286,But the executive presentations talked about a lot of these.,52,,
244,0.97,2889.286,2902.733,"The first is utilizing one time Federal funding, Esg funding this this case, to require against hotel rooms, and provide the support of services that would go with them.",52,,
245,0.97,2902.733,2908.171,"The second is similar, it's also Esg funding, and so it's one time funds again.",52,,
246,0.97,2908.171,2913.51,"And in this case, it's almost $9 million for an increase of rapid Rehousing.",52,,
247,0.97,2913.51,2921.251,That's assuming about 10 months of services for the people that would be served.,52,,
248,0.97,2921.251,2922.019,The wrong line there.,52,,
249,0.97,2922.019,2930.46,That's assuming about 230 households would be served by rapid housing assist Ance.,52,,
250,0.97,2930.46,2936.166,"To quickly reenter into housing, and become Self- sufficient.",52,,
251,0.97,2936.166,2941.705,"The next line is maintaining, or expanding rental assistance programs.",52,,
252,0.97,2941.705,2942.139,$8Million for that.,52,,
253,0.97,2942.139,2946.176,"Again, one time Esg funding for that purpose.",52,,
254,0.97,2946.176,2954.484,"After that you'll see the line labeled Covid Mod physicians, of shelters is almost $6 million.",52,,
255,0.97,2954.484,2956.586,This is a tricky one to follow.,52,,
256,0.97,2956.586,2959.289,If you've been really in the weeds.,52,,
257,0.97,2959.289,2985.248,"You will recall over last year in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, there was about 5.8, $5.7 million that was spent to open up shelters and allow some of our congregate shelters to move into other locations, but still all congregate facilities, but they're spaced out more.",52,,
258,0.97,2985.248,2988.852,This is Likele Miller community Northwest.,52,,
259,0.97,2988.852,2997.761,"That money, as we go forward at the intensification, we're going to slowly see them moving back to their original shelters.",52,,
260,0.97,2997.761,3030.26,"The reason that money was possible is in addition, there was a large amount of money distributed as a funding announcement to continue their operations in response to the pandemic, but also to support the program attic changes, that so the of these providers had to do, in order to be able to have their normal number of clients present in those shelters more safely, given what's going on with the pandemic.",52,,
261,0.97,3030.26,3044.674,"So this $5.8 million is really a merger of those amounts to move forward with providing services with those modifications, and continuing to support some of those emergency costs it had to have.",52,,
262,0.97,3044.674,3048.945,"That's kind of complicated, so I'll pause and see if we've got any questions so far.",52,,
263,0.97,3048.945,3052.816,"Not seeing any Ands up at this moment, Jeff.",53,,
264,0.97,3052.816,3063.293,The new enhanced shelter is one of the places where we are seeing Hsd received increase onion going funding.,54,,
265,0.97,3063.293,3068.865,This would be funding for a new enhanced shelter.,54,,
266,0.97,3068.865,3078.308,"Others estimate it would be 125 units potentially, but that could vary, of course, when you come down to the facilities and operations, things like that.",54,,
267,0.97,3078.308,3087.15,"Then you'll see continuing one time funding changes, and actually, if you look at that last line, which looks like a large reduction, there are some budgetary changes there.",54,,
268,0.97,3087.15,3106.336,"Things that were added over the last two years, either by the counselor, or the Mayor that may have just been given as a pilot program, or as a one time funding allotment to test a model or service type on $1.1 million is being spent to maintain a lot of those.",54,,
269,0.97,3106.336,3117.614,"Some good examples of that, the outreach, the mental health Outworkers, I believe they're operating in conjunction with the Bia's, which is something the Council has provided over 9 years.",54,,
270,0.97,3117.614,3124.488,"That's being provided in one time funding, and a lot of other additions that the Council maybe last year as well.",54,,
271,0.97,3124.488,3167.664,"The primary item that there was one of those highlighted being move the into the urban League contract, and that as Hsd presented last week was actually, the urban League's agent for that contract, that contract is set up in a way it forward . to observe those going last is a diversion increase of the homeless system diversion, this as the ones I started with is one time funding through Asg allowing us to serve mistakenly 230 families.",54,,
272,0.97,3167.664,3181.811,"It should be 130 families in our memo that are currently Speciousing homeless, so hopefully helping them to avoid a long term Stent in experiencing homelessness.",54,,
273,0.97,3181.811,3184.714,"I'm sorry, did I interrupt you on this slide?",55,,
274,0.97,3184.714,3191.087,"I believe, I just want to check to see if Councilmember Strauss had a question?",55,,
275,0.97,3191.087,3196.56,"Aly, did you have a piece for Larification as well?",55,,
276,0.97,3196.56,3198.028,"Okay, Councilmember Herbold go ahead.",55,,
277,0.97,3198.028,3205.902,"I'm sorry, could we go back to slide one?",56,,
278,0.97,3205.902,3207.17,There we go.,56,,
279,0.97,3207.17,3208.405,As it relates to outreach.,56,,
280,0.97,3208.405,3217.647,I'm confused as to why it shows 14.3% reduction.,56,,
281,0.97,3217.647,3242.939,"You may have already addressed this, but given that the Council allocated $1.4 million Additionally for outreach, as part of a navigation team changes, maybe that just wasn't captured because of the Lateness of that action as compared to when this budget was released, but just not understanding that line there.",56,,
282,0.97,3242.939,3249.346,"Sure, so the first column 2020 adopted would actually proceed the action that the Council took over the summer.",57,,
283,0.97,3249.346,3258.588,So none of the additional funds that the Council provided is actually reflected in that $10.9 million as the 2020 amount.,57,,
284,0.97,3258.588,3268.498,"Instead that would be if I had another column that showed the 2020 supplemental, for example, that's when you see that.",57,,
285,0.97,3268.498,3277.507,"Super, thank you.",58,,
286,0.97,3277.507,3279.609,Did that answer the question?,59,,
287,0.97,3279.609,3279.976,Thank you.,60,,
288,0.97,3279.976,3290.42,"I'm going to turn it over to Brian then, he's going to talk about the Seattle public utilities related to homelessness.",61,,
289,0.97,3290.42,3291.521,"Thank you, Jeff.",62,,
290,0.97,3291.521,3293.323,"Good afternoon, Councilmembers.",62,,
291,0.97,3293.323,3307.871,"Seattle public utilities, or Spu, they're 2021 proposed budget includes President $9.6 million of a appropriations for programs that are related to homelessness.",62,,
292,0.97,3307.871,3309.105,A significant increase in the 2020 budget.,62,,
293,0.97,3309.105,3318.081,"If you're looking at the memo, it's on page 4. the increase is primarily attributable to the new public hygiene program, and to the transfer of a cleanup project.",62,,
294,0.97,3318.081,3324.254,"So the public hygiene program began earlier this year, in response to the public health emergency.",62,,
295,0.97,3324.254,3334.998,"As you heard previously, it provides hygiene stations, which are the portable toilets, and shower trailers for unsheltered individuals.",62,,
296,0.97,3334.998,3340.537,Spu currently has 15 hygiene stations.,62,,
297,0.97,3340.537,3346.91,The proposed budget would appropriate approximately $6.3 million to continue the program with a similar level of service in 2021.,62,,
298,0.97,3346.91,3357.42,The other item that accounts for a large piece of the increase is the transfer of the $1.3 million contract from FAS.,62,,
299,0.97,3357.42,3365.028,"The project provides for encampment trash collection in areas that present safety challenges for staff, or required specialized equipment.",62,,
300,0.97,3365.028,3370.967,"The services provided under that contract are not expected to change in 2021, relative To2020.",62,,
301,0.97,3370.967,3378.408,There are four other programs that are shown on the table.,62,,
302,0.97,3378.408,3386.182,The 'em Emcampment trash.,62,,
303,0.97,3386.182,3389.686,They do receive relatively small inflationary type increases.,62,,
304,0.97,3389.686,3407.804,"The one NOTE about that, of the programs, you can see that the Rv remediation program actually shoes the largest increase at $80,000, but $57,000 is funding that was previously included in Sdot's budget, and doesn't include a true increase of cost.",62,,
305,0.97,3407.804,3416.679,Those funds will be used by Sdot to pay for its continued presentation in the program.,62,,
306,0.97,3416.679,3417.213,I see a question.,62,,
307,0.97,3417.213,3418.515,Councilmember Herbold.,63,,
308,0.97,3418.515,3453.683,"Glass it relates to the 2020 adopted, I have the feeling that there's a zero in the public hygiene column and that might be true as it relates to the Seattle public utilities Department because I can't remember where we put the money, but we actually started the funding for the hygiene trailers before the pandemic, right?",63,,
309,0.97,3453.683,3456.152,We included funding for them last year.,63,,
310,0.97,3456.152,3459.756,And I'm not remembering what the dollar amount was.,63,,
311,0.97,3459.756,3461.391,I think it was like $1.4 million.,63,,
312,0.97,3461.391,3467.73,But it seems like that should be reflected.,63,,
313,0.97,3467.73,3491.754,"The other piece of public hygiene that was started last year before the pandemic, in response to city auditor recommendations that the Council had the privilege of seeing before the adult was released in February, relates specifically to Svu's Rv pump out program.",63,,
314,0.97,3491.754,3509.472,"Seattle public utilities has done a fantastic job of piloting this program, where they actually take a pump out truck to Rv locations and they're doing many more this year than they anticipated doing.",63,,
315,0.97,3509.472,3522.185,"And now they're piloting an actual location where people have, who have Rv's that are Drivable that they can actually drive to the pump out location.",63,,
316,0.97,3522.185,3553.683,"I just, I feel like the 2020 adopted column doesn't fully capture the investments that the Council made in the 2020 budget Maybe because they're in another place, but I just want that reflected for the record that this Council has really worked hard again, before the pandemic, to support Hsd and Seattle public utilities on these programs.",63,,
317,0.97,3553.683,3554.984,Thank you Councilmember.,64,,
318,0.97,3554.984,3556.085,You're absolutely right.,64,,
319,0.97,3556.085,3558.421,I'll let Jeff respond to the amount.,64,,
320,0.97,3558.421,3562.258,"The Rv pump out, I think that's just my Oversite.",64,,
321,0.97,3562.258,3566.296,"You're right, that should have been included in this.",64,,
322,0.97,3566.296,3568.631,"The 2020 amount is $195,000 that Spu does have.",64,,
323,0.97,3568.631,3578.908,"I would have to look back to find the number from last year, but it is similar to that amount.",64,,
324,0.97,3578.908,3580.843,So you're absolutely right.,64,,
325,0.97,3580.843,3582.845,"Referee: I believe it was 1.62, something like that.",65,,
326,0.97,3582.845,3584.981,I can get that number if needed.,65,,
327,0.97,3584.981,3598.795,"That number, if you go back to the Hsd table, it's broken down, but you'll see a line that has, sadly it's not broken down the way I want it to to be Wrvment it's all rolled into one line.",65,,
328,0.97,3598.795,3603.733,"Because of that, it doesn't show adequately that the Council provided the increase.",65,,
329,0.97,3603.733,3609.105,"Then when you take in contract inflation, it's just not a very visible number.",65,,
330,0.97,3609.105,3615.411,"But you're absolutely right, that is included still.",65,,
331,0.97,3615.411,3615.778,Thank you.,66,,
332,0.97,3615.778,3622.952,Just trying to remember what we heard from director Hara.,66,,
333,0.97,3622.952,3644.707,"I recall she said that those dollars provided by the Council in 2020 for pit stops were not used, because we ended up using FEMA dollars, but that Spu still intends to use them for new mobile hygiene services.",66,,
334,0.97,3644.707,3649.212,So I'm not sure if they're doing new mobile hygiene services.,67,,
335,0.97,3649.212,3655.218,"There is a transfer to Spu in the budget, that it's 850Ish thousand dollars, which is that funding.",67,,
336,0.97,3655.218,3663.593,"It's a portion of the funding that was provided in 2020 to support it, but that amount is part of the $6.3 million that's reflected in the slide.",67,,
337,0.97,3663.593,3668.498,So it's not in addition to the $6.3 million.,67,,
338,0.97,3668.498,3675.838,"Right, but it also doesn't sound like it's transferring over the full 1.3.",68,,
339,0.97,3675.838,3679.575,"Did you see they're transferring $600,000?",68,,
340,0.97,3679.575,3682.512,"I believe it's about 830, or $840,000.",69,,
341,0.97,3682.512,3685.314,We'd have to check on the rest of the amount.,69,,
342,0.97,3685.314,3687.517,"But there's a difference there, yes.",69,,
343,0.97,3687.517,3702.799,"If somebody could also confirm, my recollection, they're working on doing a made for Seattle fabrication of these trailers.",70,,
344,0.97,3702.799,3720.583,"I remember also hearing Department Mayor talk about this, because he was wanting to correct my Mischaracterization of the Council's action that we did not include showers in what we were envisioning, and what they're building does include showers, which is fantastic.",70,,
345,0.97,3720.583,3731.26,"Yes, I can't confirm they are building and purchasing to kind of specialize, as you said, shower trailers.",71,,
346,0.97,3731.26,3733.563,Can you also remind me?,72,,
347,0.97,3733.563,3740.103,"I thought we did hygiene centers the year before that as well, in 2018?",72,,
348,0.97,3740.103,3744.941,I'd have to go back and look at that Councilmember.,73,,
349,0.97,3744.941,3746.008,I don't recall.,73,,
350,0.97,3746.008,3750.58,"Actually, I wasn't even covering these investments at that point.",73,,
351,0.97,3750.58,3761.924,"I think there was an expansion of hygiene services, but I don't know that we were funding multiple pit stops.",73,,
352,0.97,3761.924,3763.192,That's correct.,74,,
353,0.97,3763.192,3783.379,"I think previous Council investments were really focused on funding hygiene services at locations like the urban rest stop, and hygiene services provided Othercompass, other community based organizations for homeless people.",74,,
354,0.97,3783.379,3783.746,Thank you.,75,,
355,0.97,3783.746,3792.588,"Councilmember Pedersen, did you have something on this?",75,,
356,0.97,3792.588,3793.523,Might be frozen.,75,,
357,0.97,3793.523,3794.857,"Okay, Aly did you have anything?",75,,
358,0.97,3794.857,3818.948,"I just wanted to know, we can verify chairs, getting Councilmember Herbold, but I think some with FEMA supported investments, there is a city match, and so some of the funds that were authorized in the 2020 proposed budget would likely have been used to cover the 25% match that is required by the city, but we will follow up to confirm.",76,,
359,0.97,3818.948,3820.183,"Great, thank you.",77,,
360,0.97,3820.183,3825.021,And I think we have Councilmember Pedersen back with us.,77,,
361,0.97,3825.021,3829.826,"Councilmember Pedersen, did you have anything?",77,,
362,0.97,3829.826,3829.992,No?,77,,
363,0.97,3829.992,3832.862,Okayokay.,77,,
364,0.97,3832.862,3833.095,Great.,77,,
365,0.97,3833.095,3835.965,I had a quick question regarding the Federal funds.,77,,
366,0.97,3835.965,3839.435,"Let's see, pages 2 and 3, prior to the Svu walk through.",77,,
367,0.97,3839.435,3853.95,"I just wanted to confirm on the dollars that we're using, there's no time limit in which we have to spend these dollars, is that accurate?",77,,
368,0.97,3853.95,3860.923,"In the Sg funds, is that what you're asking?",78,,
369,0.97,3860.923,3866.896,We're using Federal Covid.,79,,
370,0.97,3866.896,3867.797,On maintain Deintensification.,79,,
371,0.97,3867.797,3872.034,Are there any Timeframes with these revenue streams?,79,,
372,0.97,3872.034,3877.74,I don't Reall of them off the top of my head.,80,,
373,0.97,3877.74,3882.812,"Esg, for example, I believe can go into 2022.",80,,
374,0.97,3882.812,3893.756,"I don't recall the end date for CDBG, and obviously the joint Covid funds, that's somethin with the city generated revenue.",80,,
375,0.97,3893.756,3894.023,Sorry.,81,,
376,0.97,3894.023,3901.03,The one I'm looking at is the leased hotel rooms.,81,,
377,0.97,3901.03,3905.101,"That could extend to 2022, because it's an emergency grant.",82,,
378,0.97,3905.101,3905.434,All right.,83,,
379,0.97,3905.434,3908.204,I think we got through half of this memo.,83,,
380,0.97,3908.204,3912.675,Or a third of this memo.,83,,
381,0.97,3912.675,3915.678,Let's get into issue identification.,83,,
382,0.97,3915.678,3919.916,"Sure, there's two items that central staff as flagged as issues.",84,,
383,0.97,3919.916,3939.435,"The first is as Councilmembers are all aware over this summer, supplemental, during supplemental actions, the Council redirected funding for the navigation team to provide it to outreach for Unshelterring Encampments.",84,,
384,0.97,3939.435,3946.776,"The 2021 proposed budget, restores a team that is similar in nature to the navigation team.",84,,
385,0.97,3946.776,3951.681,"It's smaller, and the executive noted that it does not include police on that team.",84,,
386,0.97,3951.681,3953.683,It's only eight members.,84,,
387,0.97,3953.683,3962.091,"Nevertheless, it is returned into Exitance.",84,,
388,0.97,3962.091,3964.36,I'm flagging that for Councilmembers attention.,84,,
389,0.97,3964.36,3976.739,A stronger focus of that team would be to focus on a number of outreach teams.,84,,
390,0.97,3976.739,3983.579,There are certain that would low over some other agency providing the referral.,84,,
391,0.97,3983.579,3993.122,So that centralized function would support all of outreach agencies and having access to those programs.,84,,
392,0.97,3993.122,3995.958,It's just we're noting that that is restored.,84,,
393,0.97,3995.958,4010.639,And there seem to be four different options that Councilmembers could take in response to that change of the 2020 budget.,84,,
394,0.97,4010.639,4019.648,The first would be to not respond to that team.,84,,
395,0.97,4019.648,4026.589,"The proposed budget makes this new team, you don't see them maintaining of that redirected funds.",84,,
396,0.97,4026.589,4030.159,"So instead, they're being bumped up almost as homeless outreach, for example.",84,,
397,0.97,4030.159,4041.637,"It's staying flat with what's already been provided, so the Council could choose to restore that bump up, that was provided halfway through this year.",84,,
398,0.97,4041.637,4071.7,"And then, third, the Council could impose a Revisal for a variety of activities, which could include something along the lines of defining when a removal could occur, or adjusting the rules that guide when such a team would be engaged in a clean up, or how they would engage with people that are experiencing unsheltered homelessness along those lines, and clearly the Council can choose to take an action or not at all.",84,,
399,0.97,4071.7,4077.64,Are there any questions on that step?,84,,
400,0.97,4077.64,4084.18,"Any questions, colleagues?",85,,
401,0.97,4084.18,4084.78,Seeing none.,85,,
402,0.97,4084.78,4086.849,Let's move onto item number 2 then.,86,,
403,0.97,4086.849,4092.288,"I'm sorry, Jeff, I will just.",87,,
404,0.97,4092.288,4126.956,"Note that this is obviously the point of discussion right now, given the bills that were introduced for 2020, there's still a question about what do we want 2021 to look like, so I just want folks to know that, just because it was put forward, and there's no discussion right now, does not mean that the Council is moving forward with the proposal for 2021 as is, given the ongoing conversations about what 2020 will look like, and soon to be you know, future conversations about 2021, which you will see also reflected in various proposals that we'll be discussing later.",87,,
405,0.97,4126.956,4129.992,"Council colleagues, the need to add to that?",87,,
406,0.97,4129.992,4152.581,"Perhaps said another way, I see that option C would be an opportunity to align the outcome of the conversations that are happening right now with the bill, that Councilmember Lewis has introduced with our expectations for 2021.",88,,
407,0.97,4152.581,4154.016,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",89,,
408,0.97,4154.016,4156.852,Thank you.,90,,
409,0.97,4156.852,4183.445,"And yes, as you indicated when we get to Councilmember actions I will be going through a proposal that we will be introducing for what 2021 would look like and to try to put in place for the future some of the things that we have recently reached agreement with, with the executive.",90,,
410,0.97,4183.445,4193.289,We will look forward to that conversation about 2021.,91,,
411,0.97,4193.289,4199.461,"Thank you, Jeff, we're on page six of the memo for folks following along with that document.",91,,
412,0.97,4199.461,4208.571,This is related to the resources that would be given to the new King County and regional homelessness authority.,92,,
413,0.97,4208.571,4216.478,"As you might have noticed in the very first slide I put out, there is a decrease in staffing and administration.",92,,
414,0.97,4216.478,4237.032,"Councilmembers will recall in creating the original homelessness party, the agreement says that Seattle would provide the same funding budgeted at basically at that time, with Hsd, for homeless services contracts, and administrative related expenses.",92,,
415,0.97,4237.032,4244.239,"Those contracts were understood, and it was to not provide the Healthcare for homelessness contract.",92,,
416,0.97,4244.239,4258.454,"And a thorough support program housing people with A.I.D.S., and also the navigation team, or in this case as proposed in the 2021 budget, unsheltered outreach and response team.",92,,
417,0.97,4258.454,4264.593,But generally speaking the majority of homelessness contracts are to move it to Kcrha.,92,,
418,0.97,4264.593,4285.481,"And the county would be doing the same, so you'd have a certain amount of administrative funds, we're not talking 1 to 1 here, but some plot of funds that had been used for administration.",92,,
419,0.97,4285.481,4295.224,"The 2021 proposed budget takes a variety of steps that decrease that overall amount of funding, while still planning to transfer it to regional authority.",92,,
420,0.97,4295.224,4303.132,There could potentially be an impact on the funds that the regional authority would have operate.,92,,
421,0.97,4303.132,4306.301,There are six steps that are entirely eliminated.,92,,
422,0.97,4306.301,4317.112,There's two more that are transferred to a new division along with the associated funding.,92,,
423,0.97,4317.112,4323.852,"There's a little more than $400,000 in efficiencies that would occur, so that is cut.",92,,
424,0.97,4323.852,4326.255,Another amount that would be retained.,92,,
425,0.97,4326.255,4332.728,"So in totality, that's a fair amount of funding that is being changed for perhaps wouldn't be available for the regional 3.",92,,
426,0.97,4332.728,4341.67,The Council will have a chance when it comes time for the supplemental budget to look at what gets transferred.,92,,
427,0.97,4341.67,4343.972,That's when some of the funding changes are actually made.,92,,
428,0.97,4343.972,4356.885,"But we are setting up a dynamic, where in 2021, there would be a certain degree of less administrative authority funding for the authority.",92,,
429,0.97,4356.885,4377.806,"So flagging that, around noting that primarily the options are to identify some kind of funding, last year, for example had some initial start up funding that is not provided in the 2021 budget, or also just taking no action, and what is being confirmed so far.",92,,
430,0.97,4377.806,4379.141,Thank you very much.,93,,
431,0.97,4379.141,4387.95,"Council president and Councilmember Lewis, as members of the committee, is there anything else to add to this for context before we take questions?",93,,
432,0.97,4387.95,4390.285,I'm happy to just Chime in really quickly.,94,,
433,0.97,4390.285,4436.965,"Do I have a form a, that I submitted so I think there will be an opportunity for me to add a little more texture then, so I'm happy to hold my comments until then, but I think Jeff, welcome back, has appropriately identified what the issues are, and I really appreciate that additional texture, and I have a form a, that will continue to keep this item on the front Burner so that we can consider what we want to do in 2021, given the delay in the implementation of the King County homelessness authority, and I'm happy to talk a little more, once my issue for me comes up.",94,,
434,0.97,4436.965,4437.232,Great.,95,,
435,0.97,4437.232,4440.068,We will look forward to more then.,95,,
436,0.97,4440.068,4441.103,Anything else Councilmember Lewis for context?,95,,
437,0.97,4441.103,4449.978,"I don't have anything to add to Jeff's presentation, but as we go through the other issue of identification, I may weigh in.",96,,
438,0.97,4449.978,4450.345,Excellent.,97,,
439,0.97,4450.345,4450.746,"All right, Jeff.",97,,
440,0.97,4450.746,4456.718,I'm not seeing any hands at this moment.,97,,
441,0.97,4456.718,4491.253,"I will just note that there's a lot of concern from folks who work with homeless service providers who have a lot of uncertainty as to when their services would transfer over, and as the full Council, it couldn't come soon enough, and I know that our good representatives on the body are making that call as well.",97,,
442,0.97,4491.253,4521.383,"We do need to have strong leadership at the helm to make sure that it's successful, so we understand the delay, by just wanted to underscore the importance of securing those frontline providers and the folks working within Hsd to fulfill that sense of stability, and knowing when this transfer will take place is really paramount for them, according to what has been reported to me.",97,,
443,0.97,4521.383,4521.717,Okay.,97,,
444,0.97,4521.717,4522.317,Let's move forward.,97,,
445,0.97,4522.317,4524.453,"Thank you very much, Jeff.",97,,
446,0.97,4524.453,4531.193,"We are now onto page 7, budget actions.",97,,
447,0.97,4531.193,4537.733,Issue identification as closed by Councilmember.,97,,
448,0.97,4537.733,4539.401,These are categorized into groups.,98,,
449,0.97,4539.401,4544.006,The first section of this is relate today tiny home villages.,98,,
450,0.97,4544.006,4557.619,"The first proposal comes from Councilmember Lewis, making an add of $10.9 million for the creation of 300 tiny home beds, which includes both one time, and ongoing requests.",98,,
451,0.97,4557.619,4567.429,This could be the addition or using those funds for something different than what is proposed in the 2020-2021 budget.,98,,
452,0.97,4567.429,4570.999,I'll defer to Councilmember Lewis.,98,,
453,0.97,4570.999,4573.702,"Thank you, Jeff.",99,,
454,0.97,4573.702,4609.638,"I also want to thank Councilmember Sawant who has ostensibly made the same request, worded differently for item 4, which we will get to later, and would you know certainly in working through all of these, I think there's a consensus here, that tiny House villages are one of the most conspicuously absent interventions, or a shelter options I should say from the initial proposal we have received from the executive.",99,,
455,0.97,4609.638,4625.187,"And we know from a lot of our grappling with additive shelter, you know, this is something that has a very high rate of acceptance, very high track record of success.",99,,
456,0.97,4625.187,4633.628,And something that we certainly should have more of.,99,,
457,0.97,4633.628,4676.805,"You know, from my Coronavirus with conversations with folks, they have indicated to me, 300 tiny home beds would make a colossal difference, which would increase the system to 600 total beds in terms of getting folks through that transitional shelter into permanent supportive housing by transferring the bottle neck, more from the Unsanctioned Encampments, and two, to tiny home villages, where I think we can all agree, that is just a much better place for people to be.",99,,
458,0.97,4676.805,4697.526,"So the 300 tiny home placements as a number that my office came up with in consultation with a broad away of different Stakeholders, and being a number that would make a very material difference, and would certainly like to see if there's ways that we can get a little closer to a number that's that high.",99,,
459,0.97,4697.526,4711.94,"And I'll leave it at that for now, but just want to make sure that Addive tiny House villages are a part of the budget that we ultimately pass.",99,,
460,0.97,4711.94,4715.844,"Even if not, more is something we need to be putting forward.",99,,
461,0.97,4715.844,4718.046,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Lewis.",100,,
462,0.97,4718.046,4731.393,"As a reminder Jeff, could you remind us how many tiny House villages were authorized last year?",100,,
463,0.97,4731.393,4734.096,Do you mean the 2020 budget?,101,,
464,0.97,4734.096,4734.362,Yes.,102,,
465,0.97,4734.362,4734.696,Two more.,103,,
466,0.97,4734.696,4737.199,So almost 100 new beds last year.,103,,
467,0.97,4737.199,4744.372,Has the executive moved forward with implementing those?,104,,
468,0.97,4744.372,4744.639,Yes.,105,,
469,0.97,4744.639,4749.411,The Covid pandemic prompted some rapid response to some of that in fact.,105,,
470,0.97,4749.411,4758.453,And so you have TC spirit village on Capitol Hill that's opened.,105,,
471,0.97,4758.453,4764.292,"The additional Fund so that an existing tiny village could be expanded, rather than a new one being opened.",105,,
472,0.97,4764.292,4767.462,That was done at Union Lake village.,105,,
473,0.97,4767.462,4784.346,"The Council also gave the executive flexibility acknowledging that sometimes the facilities become available, or the land that becomes available, may not be suitable for a tiny home, but a shelter.",105,,
474,0.97,4784.346,4790.318,"So that is Lake front house, which is in North Seattle.",105,,
475,0.97,4790.318,4794.656,Councilmember Juarez probably knows better than me.,105,,
476,0.97,4794.656,4798.927,"Okay, I don't hear her jumping in, but thank you for that overview.",106,,
477,0.97,4798.927,4806.768,And the other question that I had was the name of the tiny House village that was being threatened with shutting down.,106,,
478,0.97,4806.768,4809.538,Remind me the name of that one.,106,,
479,0.97,4809.538,4810.405,North Lake village.,107,,
480,0.97,4810.405,4814.476,"North Lake village, and that was not shut down.",108,,
481,0.97,4814.476,4814.776,Correct.,109,,
482,0.97,4814.776,4820.182,"At this point, North Lake has been allowed to continue in operations.",109,,
483,0.97,4820.182,4843.872,"I actually am not familiar with the latest status of their agreements, but I do believe that they are not, I believe they were given a formal written navigation that allowed them to stay for a certain amount of time, and I understand they were allowed to stay past it that, because of the challenges of the Covid pandemic.",109,,
484,0.97,4843.872,4851.513,I do know not what written communications were given to that village.,109,,
485,0.97,4851.513,4861.756,"Councilmember is a want, Sawant did you have an update on that?",110,,
486,0.97,4861.756,4888.45,"I will say, they had a track record of also going back on some of their original world, it was a credit to the North Lake residents themselves, and the whole community that supports them, they were able to push back on the Mayor's effort to close it down, but Yeah, I think as far as I know, it's still the end of the year, and we know the Covid crisis is not ending at that time, so we need to make sure it stays in tact.",111,,
487,0.97,4888.45,4909.037,"I'm sorry to use this as a springboard for that broader conversation, I probably should have asked it in your base Coronavirus, Jeff, but can you remind us, just to the North Lake village, is there any reference of that in the budget, assuring there is dollars in 2021?",112,,
488,0.97,4909.037,4926.488,"Last year, there was fund provided to relocate, and rent down that village, and there was a reference to that, I have not located anything along those lines in this year's budget.",113,,
489,0.97,4926.488,4927.122,For for maintaining?,114,,
490,0.97,4927.122,4927.589,Apologies.,115,,
491,0.97,4927.589,4930.191,I've only been back for a couple days.,115,,
492,0.97,4930.191,4935.563,I'm not that well versed in the tiny home funding to be absolutely certain.,115,,
493,0.97,4935.563,4937.632,But I do not recall changes being to that.,115,,
494,0.97,4937.632,4942.337,I could double check and get back to you though.,115,,
495,0.97,4942.337,4944.539,"Councilmember Sawant, do you have something to add?",116,,
496,0.97,4944.539,4955.083,"Yes, North Lake was not added, which is another problematic reason why it was not acceptable that the Mayor was trying to shut it down, because it was not a budgetary question.",117,,
497,0.97,4955.083,4967.762,"They just want the right to be there, or have the ability to move to another safe location, and then of course it will be a qustion of helping them with the resources to move.",117,,
498,0.97,4967.762,4973.835,"But in 2020, we Repurposed the funds that were supposed to be used to remove them.",117,,
499,0.97,4973.835,4978.974,"In other words, dismantling a tiny House village is not a good use of funds right now anyway.",117,,
500,0.97,4978.974,4979.274,Right.,118,,
501,0.97,4979.274,4980.975,Thank you for that.,118,,
502,0.97,4980.975,4984.179,"And so, that's a helpful reminder.",118,,
503,0.97,4984.179,4990.352,"The North Lake village is not listed in the tiny home section, because it's not actually asking for dollar amounts.",118,,
504,0.97,4990.352,4997.826,"It's asking for permission to be there, or to not be kicked out from there.",118,,
505,0.97,4997.826,5000.695,"Is that accurate, Councilmember Sawant?",118,,
506,0.97,5000.695,5000.962,Yes.,119,,
507,0.97,5000.962,5003.832,"Thank you for that background, folks.",120,,
508,0.97,5003.832,5010.238,That gets us through item one in tiny home villages.,120,,
509,0.97,5010.238,5023.218,"This proposal would add $1.65 million on start up, and operational costs for a tiny home village on land, that the actually he lotion for this has been identified already.",121,,
510,0.97,5023.218,5032.694,"Because of that, this would actually get a temporary tiny home village from what I understand, and this goes to Councilmember Pedersen.",121,,
511,0.97,5032.694,5033.061,Wonderful.,122,,
512,0.97,5033.061,5035.663,"Councilmember Pedersen, please go ahead.",122,,
513,0.97,5035.663,5037.132,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",123,,
514,0.97,5037.132,5041.77,Thank you Jeff for that overview.,123,,
515,0.97,5041.77,5059.054,"So yes, this is a location that sound transit used for staging area for the Brooklyn Avenue sound transit station, sound transit 2. that's going to be occupying up next year, and they will be building an affordable housing on this site.",123,,
516,0.97,5059.054,5064.526,"In the meantime, it can be available to actually add to capacity.",123,,
517,0.97,5064.526,5097.659,"We are seeing a lot more people experiencing homelessness in our district and that area of Seattle and the parks along I- 5. this would help to bring folks from those unsafe areas to an organized tiny home village under performance based contract with the human services Department, with managers to help exit as many people as possible to a more permanent housing solution.",123,,
518,0.97,5097.659,5104.232,"So because of the Covid pandemic, and the need for additional spacing, we really want to add capacity.",123,,
519,0.97,5104.232,5116.544,"This would just set aside money within the existing 2021 proposal and I was trying to work to find a location, and have done so.",123,,
520,0.97,5116.544,5117.445,Thank you.,123,,
521,0.97,5117.445,5123.251,"Thank you, very much, Councilmember Pedersen.",124,,
522,0.97,5123.251,5127.755,Any Questios on this?,124,,
523,0.97,5127.755,5140.468,"I have a question, I think might be for central staff.",125,,
524,0.97,5140.468,5155.35,"So do we know, is there any consideration given this site, and I want to thank Councilmember Pedersen for Actism working with Lehigh, and sound transit to secure the site.",125,,
525,0.97,5155.35,5156.384,I'm familiar with the site.,125,,
526,0.97,5156.384,5163.057,"It's in a great location, and would make a great location for a tiny House village.",125,,
527,0.97,5163.057,5172.2,"Do we know if these estimates on start up costs are impacted at all, based on the nature of the site?",125,,
528,0.97,5172.2,5178.54,Could that possibly change the estimate to go lower or higher?,125,,
529,0.97,5178.54,5202.197,"Because I know it's a pretty accessible, and tidy area that Sdot has been using as Councilmember Pedersen said throughout the tendency of the sound transit projects and the U district, and we'd wonder if how Expediently the start up could be put together.",125,,
530,0.97,5202.197,5222.517,"But I wonder if there might be a way to work on quantity Fying Quantifying that, or see if it might have to end up next year on that?",125,,
531,0.97,5222.517,5224.118,Councilmember Pedersen.,126,,
532,0.97,5224.118,5225.053,"Yeah, thank you.",127,,
533,0.97,5225.053,5237.231,"These cost estimates, I actually, I think we got from central staff a few months ago, as we were talking about expanding tiny home businesses.",127,,
534,0.97,5237.231,5240.602,It would be great if the costs came in lower.,127,,
535,0.97,5240.602,5246.975,"I just wanted to provide as much transparency, and detail as possible on this.",127,,
536,0.97,5246.975,5251.112,I can add a little bit more.,128,,
537,0.97,5251.112,5256.951,"As Councilmembers know, I was on parental leave the last couple of months.",128,,
538,0.97,5256.951,5268.963,It is affirmed we still have using the remaining estimates.,128,,
539,0.97,5268.963,5272.066,That 600 can vary widely.,128,,
540,0.97,5272.066,5276.137,"There was tremendous variation between the sites, it depends on the specifics of the location.",128,,
541,0.97,5276.137,5288.416,And I don't have any information from Hsd at this point on the costs unique to that location.,128,,
542,0.97,5288.416,5305.466,"But it seems likely that there would be that like as we do some number of tiny home villages, regardless of these proposals, that our start up costs will vary.",128,,
543,0.97,5305.466,5306.567,I appreciate that.,129,,
544,0.97,5306.567,5317.779,"Okay, seeing no additional comments, let's move onto number 3.",130,,
545,0.97,5317.779,5334.462,"Third proposal is to provide $535,000 for 60 beds, and would also, the funds would also support the residents of North Lake village in moving to those locations be and this was proposed by Councilmember Morales.",131,,
546,0.97,5334.462,5335.897,Thank you.,132,,
547,0.97,5335.897,5341.936,I figured I would just wait until we got to this before interrupting earlier.,132,,
548,0.97,5341.936,5347.675,So the North Lake village restaurants are interested in moving.,132,,
549,0.97,5347.675,5353.114,They're having trouble securing their current location.,132,,
550,0.97,5353.114,5354.816,I'm asking to fund this shelter.,132,,
551,0.97,5354.816,5356.484,I've asked this in the past.,132,,
552,0.97,5356.484,5360.421,We're bringing this form a it to respond to the needs of these community members.,132,,
553,0.97,5360.421,5364.792,They've expressed a desire to live in a Self-Managed village.,132,,
554,0.97,5364.792,5374.469,"And so this small amount of funding would allow what is already a Self-Managed village to relocate, and for two others to be stood up as well.",132,,
555,0.97,5374.469,5395.556,"It's a smaller number of total units than some of the other proposals, and it provides another option for Unhoused folks to move into a safe shelter, and to be surrounded by the community members that they're already living with.",132,,
556,0.97,5395.556,5396.657,"Questions, colleagues?",133,,
557,0.97,5396.657,5401.562,"Councilmember Pedersen, please go ahead.",133,,
558,0.97,5401.562,5402.43,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",134,,
559,0.97,5402.43,5406.3,Just wondering if there is a location in mind for that.,134,,
560,0.97,5406.3,5414.575,My understanding is they would like to come to D2.,135,,
561,0.97,5414.575,5418.846,Okay.,136,,
562,0.97,5418.846,5419.147,Thank you.,136,,
563,0.97,5419.147,5419.747,We would welcome.,137,,
564,0.97,5419.747,5426.654,"Sorry, I was on mute.",138,,
565,0.97,5426.654,5428.022,Please go ahead.,138,,
566,0.97,5428.022,5433.961,"So as Councilmember Morales noted, the 535 is different than we would typically budget.",139,,
567,0.97,5433.961,5436.731,That presumes the size of 40 units per village.,139,,
568,0.97,5436.731,5461.989,"So that would vary based on the number of units you could have, and given I don't have information, those are all numbers that relate to a agency open rating, and providing the services, like case management services, and as a navigation, things like that for the residents of that village, so a Self-Managed tiny home would likely have different costs that are occurring.",139,,
569,0.97,5461.989,5481.008,"From our earlier discussion, they confirmed that North Lake has a month to month contract with Seattle city light right now to remain on the property, and the city is currently paying for the power, water, and sewer services at this site, but not other services at this point.",139,,
570,0.97,5481.008,5482.71,Any other questions folks?,140,,
571,0.97,5482.71,5490.685,"Thank you very much Councilmember Morales, and I'm glad that the question I asked earlier helped prompt our conversation on this item here.",140,,
572,0.97,5490.685,5498.759,Appreciate you flagging that the interest is also in location in D2.,140,,
573,0.97,5498.759,5499.06,Number 4.,140,,
574,0.97,5499.06,5505.032,This proposal is similar to an earlier proposal.,141,,
575,0.97,5505.032,5530.091,"In this case, it would add $11.2 million to establish 8 new tiny home villages, similar to what we talked about as the agency, or operated ones, consistent with what are mostly in operation now, that the initial start up, usually around 600,000, and then 900,000 operations for about 40 units.",141,,
576,0.97,5530.091,5552.146,"But this proposal also has a second here that would be an allotment of funds that would not have an agency such as Lehigh operating it, but they would be managing the Sanctioning cap.",141,,
577,0.97,5552.146,5558.419,This was proposed by Councilmember Sawant.,141,,
578,0.97,5558.419,5558.953,Councilmember Sawant.,142,,
579,0.97,5558.953,5564.125,Thank you.,143,,
580,0.97,5564.125,5590.017,"So just on the Onset, I want to say I'd be happy to work with Councilmembers Lewis, Morales, and also Pedersen to submit a joint form, in reality, the proposal we have from my office is really a combination of what has been put forward by Councilmember Lewis and Councilmember Morales.",143,,
581,0.97,5590.017,5614.875,"In fact, as far as the eye indemnify number 3 is concerned, adding money to the budget to support residents in Self-Managed tiny home villages, that kind of fund would also be useful for something like density 3, which is now on the District property of a very supportive homeowner in the central district.",143,,
582,0.97,5614.875,5620.281,So this proposal is really a combination of the two proposals.,143,,
583,0.97,5620.281,5625.82,This budget amendment would essentially double the number of tiny House villages in Seattle.,143,,
584,0.97,5625.82,5650.211,"It would add $11.2 million to establish 8 new tiny home villages like those operated by Lehigh, and would add an additional $800,000 to support the operations of authorized sales managed Encampments, like those operated by Nickelsville, and share real.",143,,
585,0.97,5650.211,5664.759,"As I raised in the budget committee a couple of weeks ago, and I just see was presenting their 2021 budget, tiny House villages have been by far the most Impactful homeless service Seattle has found.",143,,
586,0.97,5664.759,5666.427,There is just absolutely overwhelming evidence.,143,,
587,0.97,5666.427,5675.569,We've heard from literally hundreds of homeless people over the past few years Testifying in public comment about how tiny House villages saved them.,143,,
588,0.97,5675.569,5687.581,"There's been no other homeless services that has had anything like the level of service of people impacted for the simple reason, there's nothing else that has worked in this way.",143,,
589,0.97,5687.581,5696.857,"It's not a surprise, because tiny homes are safe, and warm, and secure and they provide a community.",143,,
590,0.97,5696.857,5697.825,They provide services.,143,,
591,0.97,5697.825,5702.396,"They provide kitchen and wash room, and shower services.",143,,
592,0.97,5702.396,5723.15,"I mean it really, you know, it's a rare solution that brings back humanity into homes services, and in addition because of the budget town hall that I hosted last night, we also heard from residents about how tiny House villages have helped them keep Covid at Bay.",143,,
593,0.97,5723.15,5727.321,So I think this is a real phenomenon that has played a very prominent role.,143,,
594,0.97,5727.321,5734.595,"We've also been, as you all know, working with Nickelsville for years.",143,,
595,0.97,5734.595,5743.003,"They have authorized support from the city, and could be Reallyreformed by electricity, tiny House garbage services.",143,,
596,0.97,5743.003,5748.743,"They could really improve their services as they have informed us, if they had some city funds.",143,,
597,0.97,5748.743,5757.752,"And every time Seattle opens tiny House villages, people immediately move off the streets to fill them.",143,,
598,0.97,5757.752,5758.919,So it's a concrete solution.,143,,
599,0.97,5758.919,5762.156,"Alternatively, what we need is affordable housing.",143,,
600,0.97,5762.156,5766.794,"When we discuss the office of housing budget, I discussed an amendment to do that.",143,,
601,0.97,5766.794,5771.665,"But as long as people are homeless, they should also be warm, safe.",143,,
602,0.97,5771.665,5778.239,"Tiny House Availables, just sorry, one correction, I misspoke a limb bit earlier.",143,,
603,0.97,5778.239,5788.315,"Density, trees in D4, the Nickelsville villages what's in D3 are in support of the homeowner.",143,,
604,0.97,5788.315,5790.384,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",144,,
605,0.97,5790.384,5791.051,Questions on this item?,144,,
606,0.97,5791.051,5798.359,"Okay, I appreciate you signaling that there's a lot of synergy here as well.",144,,
607,0.97,5798.359,5808.602,Looking forward to see where various items could potentially fit together for a rolled up proposal as well.,144,,
608,0.97,5808.602,5814.608,But I'm just happy to see so much support for this model.,144,,
609,0.97,5814.608,5818.479,I just want to flag one more thing.,145,,
610,0.97,5818.479,5832.493,I do agree with Councilmember Sawant's approach to see if we can Harmonize these things into a form B. but I wanted to ask one question.,145,,
611,0.97,5832.493,5847.274,"In terms of, my forming kind of focuses on seeking the 300 additional beds, while Councilmember is a Sawant focuses on the villages.",145,,
612,0.97,5847.274,5876.103,"I wonder if there's been an analysis done by central staff, or if there could be in terms of village expansion . I know that directly after the Covid state of emergency, the South Lake Union tiny House village in my district was expanded in terms of the number of beds to be above the average number.",145,,
613,0.97,5876.103,5889.283,"And I'd be interested in seeing if that's something that could be Replicated in some of the other existing villages as well in addition to standing up new ones, which we know we will need to.",145,,
614,0.97,5889.283,5892.286,But it would be curious to see if there could be a way to do that.,145,,
615,0.97,5892.286,5901.028,"I know that in South Lake Union, we were able to do it in a way that was Compliant with social distancing, and other Covid precautions.",145,,
616,0.97,5901.028,5910.304,"There still has not been, to my knowledge, based on talking to providers, a confirmed case of Covid in any of the tiny House villages.",145,,
617,0.97,5910.304,5919.446,"So they've been able to maintain very strong public health practices, including in South Lake Union, where the number of houses was increased.",145,,
618,0.97,5919.446,5939.633,"So I would be curious in doing that as part of the approach, for example, if we could expand two or three of the existing villages, we could do that, in exchange for a new one.",145,,
619,0.97,5939.633,5943.604,I would be curious how that would impact this.,145,,
620,0.97,5943.604,5956.283,"In last years's budget, actually, Councilmember Mosqueda included, I think with a good amount of support, a request from the executive provider of port that detailed the locations that would be suitable across the city.",146,,
621,0.97,5956.283,5959.119,"Obviously, some large set of properties.",146,,
622,0.97,5959.119,5965.826,"A smaller number that are suitable, and a smaller number that would be immediately available.",146,,
623,0.97,5965.826,5975.436,"That report was initially due before the Covid pandemic, and it was given a couple of extensions, and at this point, we have not received that response at all.",146,,
624,0.97,5975.436,5978.806,That would provide the detail that you're asking for.,146,,
625,0.97,5978.806,5979.807,But we haven't received that.,146,,
626,0.97,5979.807,5993.854,I can say that the expansion of Lake Union village was something that had Repeately been brought up in conversations about the expansion of tiny home villages overall before us.,146,,
627,0.97,5993.854,5997.324,I know that was of top of mind for many people.,146,,
628,0.97,5997.324,6005.466,"I can't speak to the ability of every other tiny home, existing tiny home village to be expanded.",146,,
629,0.97,6005.466,6006.3,Appreciate that.,147,,
630,0.97,6006.3,6006.533,Thanks.,147,,
631,0.97,6006.533,6014.308,Thank you for the reminder of what we got in the budget last year too.,148,,
632,0.97,6014.308,6023.016,"Can we also ping the executive to request that draft of the memo, that they have a new draft of that report that gets sent out.",148,,
633,0.97,6023.016,6029.723,We also have the enterprise map.,148,,
634,0.97,6029.723,6035.262,"It should be hopefully an easier report to pull, now that we have that large Database.",148,,
635,0.97,6035.262,6038.665,That's really dynamic as well.,148,,
636,0.97,6038.665,6044.838,So look forward to getting an update on that.,148,,
637,0.97,6044.838,6045.873,Councilmember Sawant.,148,,
638,0.97,6045.873,6046.874,Last item number on this?,148,,
639,0.97,6046.874,6059.586,"Yes, just on the point about whether it should be increasing the number of villages or expanding the available beds inside existing villages.",149,,
640,0.97,6059.586,6101.862,"Obviously, needless to say, we don't care which way it's done because the purpose is to increase tiny House village space for homeless individuals, and as long as it works for the space that's available, and for the managing resources that are available in the existing village, and that the expectation is that if you want to increase Covid risks in any way, of course, every tiny House village existing, should be helped, and provided the opportunity to expand, but I will say, and this goes to something that Jeff was eluding to.",149,,
641,0.97,6101.862,6108.635,"Uniquely able to be expanded, it was an exception to the rule, and we should not assume that that's the way it goes.",149,,
642,0.97,6108.635,6122.649,"In fact, if you talk to Lehigh, and other people who actually build those tiny homes, and have a lot of experience of scouting the sites where they can site them.",149,,
643,0.97,6122.649,6129.756,They will tell you that often the reason it works out is those are the spaces that are not being used for anything else.,149,,
644,0.97,6129.756,6142.069,"The space next to the Lutheran church, it's because it's not useable for anything else, because of the various actors space . E smallness of the the land gradations.",149,,
645,0.97,6142.069,6146.173,"I'm not a civil engineer, but factors like that.",149,,
646,0.97,6146.173,6165.025,"So we should make sure that they are allowed to pick out sites that work for them, and make use of that in addition to expanding an existing village, where it already exists, so I don't see that as in any way in conflict.",149,,
647,0.97,6165.025,6167.261,I think that we want both.,149,,
648,0.97,6167.261,6174.134,"Also, I'll mention, something that I forgot to mention earlier, Lehigh has already identified six locations for a new village.",149,,
649,0.97,6174.134,6175.536,This is something that's viable.,149,,
650,0.97,6175.536,6176.17,It's ready to go.,149,,
651,0.97,6176.17,6188.482,"All they need is the resources to go and one last thing, I'll say in terms of keeping an open mind, and allowing the people on the ground to do their work.",149,,
652,0.97,6188.482,6204.264,"We, in addition to expanding new beds as much as possible, we will absolutely need new villages, because otherwise we will not be allowed to scale up to the scale, sufficiently given the number of individuals who are unsheltered, on the streets.",149,,
653,0.97,6204.264,6209.369,I think it will have to absolutely be both.,149,,
654,0.97,6209.369,6215.776,I will definitely be in touch with the various offices to pursue on this.,149,,
655,0.97,6215.776,6216.21,Great.,150,,
656,0.97,6216.21,6216.41,Okay.,150,,
657,0.97,6216.41,6220.213,Thank you all very much.,150,,
658,0.97,6220.213,6225.452,We're going to continue on here with hotel purchase.,150,,
659,0.97,6225.452,6228.455,"Oh, Aly, I'm sorry, did you have something?",150,,
660,0.97,6228.455,6242.536,"I just wanted to add in, that as a general strategy in thinking about additional funding for tiny home villages or expansion of tiny home villages, and sort of similar to what Councilmember is a want just said.",151,,
661,0.97,6242.536,6260.954,"I think it is, it may be best to not be overly prescriptive of what the strategy is, in terms of a specific number of villages or a specific number of expansions, in order to allow the Department to move as quickly as possible when there is an opportunity.",151,,
662,0.97,6260.954,6281.608,"So while there may be a desire to be really precise about what it would cost for each location, or each village, ultimately we find that circumstances sort of allow us to move faster, or slower, or to stand up certain strategies.",151,,
663,0.97,6281.608,6286.013,So being too prescriptive could hold up funds that could work under a different strategy.,151,,
664,0.97,6286.013,6288.749,Thank you so much for that reminder.,152,,
665,0.97,6288.749,6295.122,"Again, looking forward to hear more, as more of these get finalized here, given the level of interest in this across the city.",152,,
666,0.97,6295.122,6301.328,"Very excited to hear that, and thank you for the overview.",152,,
667,0.97,6301.328,6306.099,Okay item number 5.,152,,
668,0.97,6306.099,6306.366,Hey Jeff.,152,,
669,0.97,6306.366,6318.278,"The next session goes to purchase for acquisition of either a hotel, or in some cases it might be suitable to look at another facility.",153,,
670,0.97,6318.278,6322.783,"These proposals look at acquiring a hotel, using Esg funds.",153,,
671,0.97,6322.783,6332.292,"I alluded to this earlier in the day when we were talking about the supplemental bill, when Amy was presenting at the beginning of the session.",153,,
672,0.97,6332.292,6353.413,"Typically, Esg cannot be used to acquire property or a building to provide emergency shelter, but the Department of housing and urban development, the U.S. has guided these rules for Covid funds, and up to $2.5 million can be used for that purchase.",153,,
673,0.97,6353.413,6359.086,"With both of these, I suspect that's is the reason for these amounts.",153,,
674,0.97,6359.086,6370.397,"Proposal number 5, would propose the purchase of a hotel using those funds, some other allocated funds, or other restriction on or guidance of the U.S. of Esg funds.",153,,
675,0.97,6370.397,6374.701,So the first one comes from Councilmember Lewis.,153,,
676,0.97,6374.701,6375.335,"Thank you, Jeff.",154,,
677,0.97,6375.335,6390.517,"I'm pretty sure, looking at Councilmember Sawant specifically identifying 100 units is probably based on us talking to some of the same Stakeholders on this one.",154,,
678,0.97,6390.517,6393.587,I'm assured these are very similar proposals.,154,,
679,0.97,6393.587,6467.828,"As we discuss, and I'd be happy to merge efforts with Councilmember Sawant pursuing this, as we look at the executive's proposals to do 300 hotel rooms, going forward I would like to see if we might be able to stretch our Federal money a little bit more by assisting a provider in purchasing a hotel to in the long term being used as a shelter for long term use, opposed to just leasing a long term hotel on the market, and if entering into that kind of arrangement might help us reduce the current price tag of $16 million, by having a third of them a lease to own sort of position with a provider where we would use this $2.5 million to help them buy the hotel, and then we can use some of the rest of that portion of that $16 million to go towards leasing some of those units to go towards paying the hotel off.",154,,
680,0.97,6467.828,6473.066,"That's something I'd like to explore through this, with that $2.5 million.",154,,
681,0.97,6473.066,6499.426,"I think it could be a good way to make sure that not only are we, you know, getting people off the street, and into hotels, but also sort of doubling the impact by inserting into our broader shelter system, another 100 units of shelter that's on the same level as a tiny House village, or enhanced shelter, probably in the long term, supportive housing.",154,,
682,0.97,6499.426,6507.567,"I'll leave it at that for now, and you know, let Councilmember is a want expand on her own provision here.",154,,
683,0.97,6507.567,6521.548,"But I think that we should definitely take advantage of the flexibility to use $2.5 million to engage in a deal like that, but it's something that, you know, I definitely want to talk to Hsd about, and some of the other potential vendors.",154,,
684,0.97,6521.548,6524.05,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Lewis.",155,,
685,0.97,6524.05,6531.157,"Jeff, anything to add to number 6 before we turn it to Councilmember Sawant?",155,,
686,0.97,6531.157,6531.391,No.,156,,
687,0.97,6531.391,6532.792,"Okay, Councilmember Sawant, please go ahead.",157,,
688,0.97,6532.792,6554.948,"Thank you, and we don't have to separately talk about item number 7, because it is the, sorry, 6, because it's the same as what Councilmember Lewis has just proposed in item 5, and yes, Councilmember Lewis, let's work on this Offline to make sure this goes through.",158,,
689,0.97,6554.948,6559.452,"And Yeah, in terms of what Councilmember Lewis was saying, Yeah, I could not agree more.",158,,
690,0.97,6559.452,6570.096,"We absolutely need to make sure that this gets converted really into affordable housing of some kind, maybe permanent supportive housing.",158,,
691,0.97,6570.096,6582.008,"In fact, Lehigh, which is the organization that is ready to go on a project like this, and who brought this proposal forward to us, that is exactly what they want to do.",158,,
692,0.97,6582.008,6606.032,"That's what they are really eager to do, which is that once the current need is over for shelter units during the pandemic, that they can renovate them into affordable housing after the emergency is over, and absolutely whatever available Federal dollars there are that can be leveraged for that, we should absolutely make sure that happens.",158,,
693,0.97,6606.032,6607.3,Thank you so much.,159,,
694,0.97,6607.3,6608.969,Appreciate you both bringing this forward.,159,,
695,0.97,6608.969,6635.295,"I know we've talked a lot about how this can be used as an economic stimulant as well locally when we have some of our hotels or motels that are sitting vacant for even apartment places that might have similar occupancy opportunities instead of letting them go derelict, this is a really good opportunity for us as well to house folks, and make sure those buildings are being put to good use.",159,,
696,0.97,6635.295,6641.801,"Love that you put this forward, and look forward to hearing more about the combined effort here.",159,,
697,0.97,6641.801,6642.402,"Councilmember Herbold, great.",159,,
698,0.97,6642.402,6644.738,I was wondering if you had a question about this.,159,,
699,0.97,6644.738,6656.916,"One question quick, if I can sneak it in, the 300 rooms for $15.8 million, does that include Onm?",159,,
700,0.97,6656.916,6657.851,Operation and maintenance?,159,,
701,0.97,6657.851,6658.485,Does that include services?,159,,
702,0.97,6658.485,6658.952,I see.,159,,
703,0.97,6658.952,6666.359,"Yeah, the formulation, as I understand yes, they would include the operations and maintenance of the units.",160,,
704,0.97,6666.359,6680.774,"As the formulation took into account like how much it costs to operate, and enhance a shelter, meaning a tiny village, or a shelter that's enhanced services, and applying the underlying cost for the facility, in this case of getting a hotel.",160,,
705,0.97,6680.774,6686.379,"So it is actually the services that would go along with it, not just the actual rooms.",160,,
706,0.97,6686.379,6704.397,"In terms of stretching these dollars further as Councilmember Lewis mentioned, one area I'd like to look into is it our partnership with organizations like reach, who I think earlier this year had indicated that they do have capacity to support people within hotel rooms.",161,,
707,0.97,6704.397,6710.37,"What they needed was the city to move forward with renting those rooms, or purchasing those rooms so that people could get into them.",161,,
708,0.97,6710.37,6721.548,"So I wonder if we could even further stretch out the number of units available, if we are doing this in partnership with organizations that do have capacity for that support of service.",161,,
709,0.97,6721.548,6723.75,I have just flagged I have not looked into that.,161,,
710,0.97,6723.75,6727.053,I'll turn it over to Councilmember Herbold at this point.,161,,
711,0.97,6727.053,6727.821,Just a question.,162,,
712,0.97,6727.821,6736.729,"Are options five and six, are they additives to the executive' proposal?",162,,
713,0.97,6736.729,6743.002,Or are they intended to use the funds from the executive's proposal?,162,,
714,0.97,6743.002,6747.307,They would both be added to it I believe is how you would phrase it.,163,,
715,0.97,6747.307,6750.31,"As I highlighted earlier, going through what is proposed.",163,,
716,0.97,6750.31,6757.15,The Hsd budget does include the accusation of a facility for an enhanced shelter.,163,,
717,0.97,6757.15,6759.486,It's estimating around 125 beds.,163,,
718,0.97,6759.486,6769.362,"That is not envisioning the use of these Eng beds, and nor is it Hsd doing that accusation.",163,,
719,0.97,6769.362,6775.568,It does not include Awiring some facility.,163,,
720,0.97,6775.568,6777.036,It did include providing operations long term.,163,,
721,0.97,6777.036,6793.386,"And if I could just add, I think, I mean, it's additive, but it would be using the funds perhaps in a different way, but to the extend that the Esg money proposed by the Mayor is for leasing hotels.",164,,
722,0.97,6793.386,6802.662,"If it is instead used to purchase a hotel, then the service dollars would stretch longer.",164,,
723,0.97,6802.662,6819.646,"So you know, so it's sort of a different way of getting at a similar outcome, except there would be a more permanent purchase, and then could support those rooms with services, I think into 2022.",164,,
724,0.97,6819.646,6824.651,The Esg dollars would continue.,164,,
725,0.97,6824.651,6825.618,Thank you.,165,,
726,0.97,6825.618,6825.919,Follow up.,165,,
727,0.97,6825.919,6826.286,Councilmembers.,165,,
728,0.97,6826.286,6826.886,Councilmember Lewis anything?,165,,
729,0.97,6826.886,6836.763,"Well Yeah, I just wanted to say, I mean I think Aly basically said what I was going to say.",166,,
730,0.97,6836.763,6850.577,"I think that there clearly as Councilmember Sawant under indicated, there's a fairly detailed Proposalfrom Lehigh how they would see this going.",166,,
731,0.97,6850.577,6855.181,Almost $16 million that the executive wants to use in their Hoteling strategy.,166,,
732,0.97,6855.181,6861.221,But I haven't really had conversations yet about whether all the circles square in going about it that way.,166,,
733,0.97,6861.221,6879.339,"I would hope they would, because as I said, it's sort of a unique opportunity to do two things at once, like help someone acquire something that could turn into permanent supportive housing, and provide the Hoteling that we want to provide.",166,,
734,0.97,6879.339,6879.739,Very helpful.,167,,
735,0.97,6879.739,6880.106,Thank you both.,167,,
736,0.97,6880.106,6884.143,"All right Jeff, I think we're ready to go onto item number 7.",167,,
737,0.97,6884.143,6889.449,The next section actually is related to hygiene service investments.,168,,
738,0.97,6889.449,6896.155,I'm going to turn it over to Brian goodnight from central staff to walk through these.,168,,
739,0.97,6896.155,6897.323,"Thank you, Jeff.",169,,
740,0.97,6897.323,6916.376,"So the first item is a proposal from Councilmember Sawant, and would add funds to plan and develop a hygiene center, including showers and laundry facilities at the site of a former wellness center in a building located in downtown Seattle.",169,,
741,0.97,6916.376,6926.753,"Let us know more, Councilmember is a Sawant.",170,,
742,0.97,6926.753,6930.69,Adjacent to the Sharon wheel offices.,171,,
743,0.97,6930.69,6941.434,The location is owned by Catholic community services who have indicated to Sharon that it is available for that purpose.,171,,
744,0.97,6941.434,6956.249,"It could provide, given these funds could provide showers and laundry facilities, including laundry for program blankets to the residents of the basic shelters.",171,,
745,0.97,6956.249,6957.884,Which obviously would be a huge help for them.,171,,
746,0.97,6957.884,6968.695,"I do want to be clear, that Besides needing funding, this project would acquire further planning, including costs and a plan for organizations.",171,,

756,0.97,7011.404,7020.813,I would also request that the expansion would begin adding Encampments in Seattle.,174,,
757,0.97,7020.813,7024.083,This begins with Councilmember Morales.,174,,
758,0.97,7024.083,7025.618,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,175,,
759,0.97,7025.618,7026.185,Please go ahead.,175,,

761,0.97,7027.02,7038.131,"As it says the program would nearly double the reach of the purple bag program which is a Win-Win for both encampment residents, and for nearby neighbors.",176,,
762,0.97,7038.131,7049.075,"I'm sure as many of you colleagues have, I've heard from lots of constituents about the need for more trash pick up near encampment sites.",176,,
763,0.97,7049.075,7056.649,My office has reached out so Spu on a continuous basis to request one time trash pick up in different parts of our district.,176,,
764,0.97,7056.649,7063.256,This proposal would help alleviate some of the trash concerns in our city.,176,,
765,0.97,7063.256,7066.926,And also address the hygiene issues during a public health emergency.,176,,
766,0.97,7066.926,7079.238,I am specifically asking for services to start in district one and District two due to the relative lack of resources spent in our parts.,176,,
767,0.97,7079.238,7086.579,"City, and the Encampments in places like Sodo, and South Park who really could use this service.",176,,
768,0.97,7086.579,7106.899,"I was in Georgetown just last week, talking with neighbors living in Encampments and in Rv's, and they showed me how they handled their trash, which is they create piles a few feet away from where they are, and dispose of it as they can.",176,,
769,0.97,7106.899,7108.234,"Often, overtly use nearby Dumpsters overnight.",176,,
770,0.97,7108.234,7110.57,Don't want to have to do that.,176,,
771,0.97,7110.57,7114.14,Their neighbors and businesses don't want them to have to do that.,176,,
772,0.97,7114.14,7122.381,So folks are looking for any kind of solution to help them deal with trash removal.,176,,
773,0.97,7122.381,7129.489,"Something that we all take for granted, since we get weekly trash pick up.",176,,
774,0.97,7129.489,7135.394,"And this expansion would move in the right direction, to help support our Houseless neighbors with same kind of service.",176,,

779,0.97,7154.747,7171.297,"This is absolutely essential given that while all of us are working towards adding a shelter, we know in the meantime, these strategies around mitigation, around extending just basic city services are the very least that we can do.",178,,
780,0.97,7171.297,7187.046,"And really cut at a lot of the issues that members of the public associate with Encampments, as well as the addition of people living in Encampments and Rv's.",178,,
781,0.97,7187.046,7191.817,"These are pragmatic, essential, and there's a moral urgency to them.",178,,

783,0.97,7200.593,7202.695,A question for central staff.,179,,
784,0.97,7202.695,7205.798,"63 street, I'm sorry, we are not there yet.",179,,
785,0.97,7205.798,7210.369,"Okay, let's go ahead and talk about the next one.",179,,
786,0.97,7210.369,7211.037,Item number 9.,179,,
787,0.97,7211.037,7211.304,Okay.,180,,
788,0.97,7211.304,7212.672,Thank you Councilmember.,180,,
789,0.97,7212.672,7228.387,"So yes, the third and final Councilmember proposal in hygiene services is that $58 million to the proposal of 53 sink Street style stations.",180,,
790,0.97,7228.387,7239.298,"The proposal intends to add hand washing services throughout the city, 9 SINKS in each of the Council districts, and the proposal comes from Councilmember Morales.",180,,
791,0.97,7239.298,7248.808,Did not mean to jump in there Councilmember Morales on the punch line.,181,,
792,0.97,7248.808,7249.775,So go ahead.,181,,
793,0.97,7249.775,7264.323,"We know access to running water for folks living outside isn't just a good practice, it is a necessity, and the street sink model that we're proposing is inexpensive.",182,,
794,0.97,7264.323,7266.692,"It's Ada Compliant, and it's low maintenance.",182,,
795,0.97,7266.692,7286.579,"The SINKS currently running in our city have helped folks wash their hands, Wash their clothes, and give them access to drinking water, which is something else that we heard about last week, as we were talking to folks in Georgetown, is just their inability to get fresh clean water to drink.",182,,
796,0.97,7286.579,7297.49,"So as we've talked to folks, they've talked about walking a mile to get water, or having to steal it from a Spigot, on a nearby business, or a residence.",182,,
797,0.97,7297.49,7320.913,"So just as with the trash pick up, you know, they don't want to do that, and they would rather have some options available within walking distance for water access, so that it doesn't become a survival situation, you know that there's something available.",182,,
798,0.97,7320.913,7328.421,"So as Council chair said, the program would bring a 63 quickly accessible SINKS for anyone to use.",182,,
799,0.97,7328.421,7331.524,We are thinking 9 SINKS in each district.,182,,
800,0.97,7331.524,7344.07,"Which means folks won't be having to make a trek to another neighborhood, just to wash their hands or get a drink of water, and this again, is especially important during a public health emergency.",182,,
801,0.97,7344.07,7346.605,"At minimum, folks need access to SINKS.",182,,
802,0.97,7346.605,7355.181,This would allow us to cross Drinkable water off of their list of things they're looking for to survive.,182,,
803,0.97,7355.181,7358.884,Just a quick question for central staff.,183,,
804,0.97,7358.884,7360.619,I don't see any other hands.,183,,
805,0.97,7360.619,7371.33,"Can you remind us how many SINKS, or hygiene centers that are just related to hand washing, are currently deployed across our city?",183,,
806,0.97,7371.33,7371.931,Sure.,184,,
807,0.97,7371.931,7378.037,"The hygiene station programs that include both the portable toilets and the hand washing stations, there are 15 of them right now.",184,,
808,0.97,7378.037,7384.844,And is that the full amount that the Council had authorized in the last one or two years?,185,,
809,0.97,7384.844,7387.98,"Those are the only ones that I'm aware of, yes.",186,,
810,0.97,7387.98,7408.868,"I'm just asking, because I know that this has been a conversation over many years, especially Councilmember and myself about wanting to see more of these Street SINKS as Councilmember Morales calls them.",187,,
811,0.97,7408.868,7409.602,It was a long conversation.,187,,
812,0.97,7409.602,7416.442,And I just want to make sure that the dollar figures have actually been implemented.,187,,
813,0.97,7416.442,7418.944,It sounds like the answer is yes.,187,,
814,0.97,7418.944,7419.145,Okay.,187,,
815,0.97,7419.145,7425.518,"Councilmember Morales, thank you so much for flagging this.",187,,

819,0.97,7435.561,7459.618,"The first is that time that the request for these proposals was submitted, we had received information that the amounts provided by the Council last year for services, for expanded services that would go to agencies that specialize in serving the American Indian, and Alaskan Indian population, that there was going to be an increase, that was incorrect.",188,,
820,0.97,7459.618,7475.801,"As I mentioned there is a lot of shuffling of budget programs and word programs in order to prepare for the moving of contracts to the original authority, so that's how that error rose.",188,,
821,0.97,7475.801,7486.278,"What I'm understanding now is the amounts totaled by the Council last year, which totaled a million dollars we're not reducing in the 2021 budget.",188,,
822,0.97,7486.278,7495.287,"In addition, both the Councilmember Juarez, and Councilmember Lewis, their offices are seeing, they both plan to work together on a single proposal related to this investment.",188,,
823,0.97,7495.287,7497.923,So I'll turn it over to both of them to talk about that.,188,,
824,0.97,7497.923,7505.03,"But they are listed as two separate items here, knowing that would be a single item.",188,,
825,0.97,7505.03,7505.497,That's excellent.,189,,
826,0.97,7505.497,7505.998,Thanks nor doing that.,189,,

905,0.97,7986.812,7990.515,"Trespassing, or threatening behavior associated with the encampment.",204,,
906,0.97,7990.515,8001.293,"I'm not saying everyone there is volatile, and threatening, but I'm saying there is an issue there.",204,,
907,0.97,8001.293,8006.598,"Residents emphasize with the homelessness in the area, but are experiencing fatigue.",204,,
908,0.97,8006.598,8013.071,That has led to a conflict between Unhoused issues with behavioral issues.,204,,
909,0.97,8013.071,8031.757,"Working with our community, Lake City community organizations, this is what they're proposing is that we can work with community and have people that are actually navigators, if you will, in helping our unsheltered community get to the services that they need.",204,,
910,0.97,8031.757,8040.599,"For the past five years, the Seattle University public safety survey identified the number one safety concern for Lake city has been the lack of police capacity and presence.",204,,
911,0.97,8040.599,8050.876,"Right now, it's just the lack of having people come out there to help these folks get the services they need.",204,,
912,0.97,8050.876,8061.153,"So right now, over 30 residents and 10 business owner, and two Nonprofits, and someone church in Lake city have signed on in favor of this proposal.",204,,
913,0.97,8061.153,8085.01,"Like I say, again, I want to ramble off a half dozen community based organizations that we've been working with since 2015 for these, to have these proposed behavioral health outreach positions of the Lake City neighborhood, and our unsheltered neighbors.",204,,
914,0.97,8085.01,8088.013,It's just been an ongoing issue.,204,,
915,0.97,8088.013,8100.025,"And now where we're Reimagining a new team to go out and provide outreach, we're hoping that this budget cycle will provide these two North end navigators.",204,,
916,0.97,8100.025,8106.932,"And I believe Councilmember, we're also working with Councilmember Strauss on this issue as well.",204,,
917,0.97,8106.932,8107.332,Thank you.,204,,
918,0.97,8107.332,8110.202,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Juarez.",205,,
919,0.97,8110.202,8114.406,Are there questions for Councilmember Juarez on item number 12?,205,,
920,0.97,8114.406,8116.975,I am not seeing any questions.,205,,
921,0.97,8116.975,8143.201,"I will NOTE from my initial glance at these items it does seem like there is a lot of Commonality between item 12 from Morales, 13 from Juarez, 16 from Strauss, as they are working with or unsheltered population, and providing assistance, and support, and outreach as well to our business community.",205,,
922,0.97,8143.201,8158.683,"So I would love to see as we have this conversation here today if there are overlapping issues, as you describe them, for Council colleagues, and to follow up on that, if there is connective tissue there, that would be helpful to know.",205,,
923,0.97,8158.683,8162.521,"Let's go ahead, and go into item number 13.",205,,
924,0.97,8162.521,8178.837,"Item number 13 is a proposal to, actually, in some says it interacts with an issue to the navigation team, and what the 2020 budget positions as an unsheltered reach and outreach team.",206,,
925,0.97,8178.837,8199.991,"This proposal would take the funds, and the FTE that are proposed and instead create a new 5 person team that provides administrative oversight, and support to outreach agencies, and provides coordination for the Unsanctioned Encampments.",206,,
926,0.97,8199.991,8201.726,This was proposed Y Councilmember Morales.,206,,
927,0.97,8201.726,8206.231,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Morales, please go ahead.",207,,
928,0.97,8206.231,8207.766,Thank you.,208,,
929,0.97,8207.766,8238.296,"Let's see, as Jeff noted the unsheltered outreach, and response team that's in the 2021 posed budget, really takes on a look of a smaller navigation team, and I believe this Council made clear in the summer, we have closed the book on the navigation team, and I'm looking toward to seeing how we can really serve our neighbors.",208,,
930,0.97,8238.296,8241.766,We think it reflects the decision that Council made over the summer.,208,,
931,0.97,8241.766,8250.242,Reflects what we've heard for years from Unhoused neighbors from providers from outreach workers and from advocates.,208,,
932,0.97,8250.242,8267.325,"That if the city is going to be part of this Ecosystem of provision of services to our homeless neighbors, then we as a city really should step back and provide the support on coordination, but really, let the experts lead on the response itself.",208,,
933,0.97,8267.325,8277.402,"So the idea here is that the hope team would be structurally different from the Navigational team, and it would serve the following purposes.",208,,
934,0.97,8277.402,8286.578,"It would really let the providers set the tone for what criteria are, how the approach to outreach would happen.",208,,
935,0.97,8286.578,8295.82,"Agreed upon with the city, it would really be letting them lead the conversation.",208,,
936,0.97,8295.82,8316.841,"The hope team would provide the Oversite, and ongoing support for provider led homelessness outreach strategy, so they would associate Interdepartment support, litter Cleanics, Sharps clean up, the purple bag program, but would not be involved in direct outreach.",208,,
937,0.97,8316.841,8322.781,That work would really be left to the service providers.,208,,
938,0.97,8322.781,8328.219,This team would cost less than the team proposed by Hsd.,208,,
939,0.97,8328.219,8335.794,"There would be, as I said, no direct outreach done by city employees, and no police involvement.",208,,
940,0.97,8335.794,8342.467,It would still allow police and other first responders to respond to any crimes that are happening in or near Encampments.,208,,
941,0.97,8342.467,8355.38,"And by funding the hope team, we can finally leave the navigation team discussion behind, and move forward with a provider led strategy.",208,,
942,0.97,8355.38,8357.048,So that's what we're proposing.,208,,
943,0.97,8357.048,8389.714,"As I said, we have been in communication with, I don't know, a dozen outreach providers, service workers, with our homeless community themselves, and I do want to give Devin Silvernail on my staff, a huge shout out for a lot of the work that he's done to pool folks together, and really listen to what they think we can do better.",208,,
944,0.97,8389.714,8405.797,"And they think this approach should look like, so I want to thank him, and I want to thank all of the providers and the homeless neighbors themselves for all of their contributions to this idea.",208,,
945,0.97,8405.797,8413.538,"Councilmember Morales, thank you so much for that overview, and for all of the work that you have done to pull together this idea and your tame.",209,,
946,0.97,8413.538,8420.478,"I know that this has been a lot of work, so we really appreciate you providing that overview.",209,,
947,0.97,8420.478,8420.945,Councilmember Lewis.,209,,
948,0.97,8420.945,8424.249,Did you want to add any comments?,209,,
949,0.97,8424.249,8443.668,"Yeah, I want to thank Councilmember Morales, and Devin for bringing this model forward, which, I mean, I'll just say I think it's a great Iteration of the jumping off point that was proffered by the executive a few weeks ago.",210,,
950,0.97,8443.668,8456.614,"And it is in keeping with a lot of the conversations we've been having with the provider community, the kind of model your seeing that really begins with a center's engagement.",210,,
951,0.97,8456.614,8472.297,"I would certainly want to see, kind of through the process that we're using right now to continue work through squaring a lot of the circles with creating a new outreach system.",210,,
952,0.97,8472.297,8482.474,"What in this model would be sort of consistent with what Hsd would like to see, and whether there's parts that there would be push back.",210,,
953,0.97,8482.474,8500.692,"You know, I would hope that we could reach an accord that is fairly similar to this, given that it really is in the spirit of what a lot of folks have been representing on all ends of the spectrum we want to be moving toward.",210,,
954,0.97,8500.692,8522.247,"So I really appreciate this proposal coming forward, and I do want to just say for the viewing public that the legislation that I put forward for releasing money for a team to close out 2020 is unrelated to these 2021 conversations, which is of note.",210,,
955,0.97,8522.247,8534.025,"That these are separate conversations, and that our conversations about 2020 don't lock us in as a Council to committing to any given model for 2021.",210,,
956,0.97,8534.025,8547.939,"So I'm glad this is on the table, and that Councilmember Morales has brought it forward, so we can be talking about this as an approach, and I look forward to continuing the conversation.",210,,
957,0.97,8547.939,8548.306,Thank you.,211,,
958,0.97,8548.306,8549.841,Councilmember Morales.,211,,
959,0.97,8549.841,8551.876,Anything else to add to that?,211,,
960,0.97,8551.876,8553.478,Nope.,212,,
961,0.97,8553.478,8555.079,I don't think so.,212,,
962,0.97,8555.079,8556.114,Okay.,213,,
963,0.97,8556.114,8556.781,Great.,213,,
964,0.97,8556.781,8557.448,I appreciate that.,213,,
965,0.97,8557.448,8580.471,"And I see Councilmember Pedersen, one comment from you, just before Councilmember Pedersen, while they might be separate discussions and separate pieces of legislation at this point, I think as we try trough provide a seamless transition, looking forward to seeing how these proposals provide that ramp into next year.",213,,
966,0.97,8580.471,8583.374,And I know that that's what you've been endeavoring to accomplish as well.,213,,
967,0.97,8583.374,8593.117,"So I just want to make sure that the provider groups, and the folks doing the direct outreach here, that area of interest for all of us as well.",213,,
968,0.97,8593.117,8594.152,Sure.,214,,
969,0.97,8594.152,8594.585,I appreciate that.,214,,
970,0.97,8594.585,8595.019,And you're right.,214,,
971,0.97,8595.019,8621.279,"I think because we've been in conversation with them forever, you know, I both understand the concern we are looking at how we can, how this transition happens, I think because of the conversations we've been having with Councilmember Lewis and with the executives with the deputy Mayor.",214,,
972,0.97,8621.279,8634.092,"I think, you know, we are all sort of moving in the same direction with a really clear understanding from the provider community, with what they think this should look like.",214,,
973,0.97,8634.092,8668.459,"So that is what we are endeavoring to do here, is that ensure that we are moving, giving them agency in figuring out what this should look like, and our plan is to it continue this conversation, as we get the form B ready, and as we have, you know, need to put a little more structure in place to move this forward, we will be having additional conversations with the provider community.",214,,
974,0.97,8668.459,8670.395,"Excellent, Councilmember Pedersen.",215,,
975,0.97,8670.395,8671.195,"Thank you, chairman.",216,,
976,0.97,8671.195,8694.452,"I'm glad to hear the discussion about working with the executive, because I just want to, I know there's obviously expertise among certain Nonprofits, and also I just want to lift up the expertise in our own city government, and our own human services Department.",216,,
977,0.97,8694.452,8699.791,"Making sure they're investing tax dollars wisely, keeping track of those dollars and the performance outcome.",216,,
978,0.97,8699.791,8704.695,So I just think that there's expertise.,216,,
979,0.97,8704.695,8714.472,"There's lots of expertise to go around, aren't I hope we get to utilize all of that, as we craft something that we can all agree to.",216,,
980,0.97,8714.472,8716.04,Absolutely.,217,,
981,0.97,8716.04,8741.399,"The idea here is that the team would be for, you know for doing some of the interdepartmental coordination, but also for doing the contract management, and for setting those kind of back office for lack of a better term, kind of infrastructure and supports that need to happen in order for the service providers to do their job.",217,,
982,0.97,8741.399,8755.98,"It's really just a pulling back of the actual direct outreach, and letting the other experts do that piece of the work.",217,,
983,0.97,8755.98,8759.817,"Excellent, I'm not seeing any additional questions at this time.",218,,
984,0.97,8759.817,8762.22,We are on number 14.,218,,
985,0.97,8762.22,8768.893,A continuation of our conversation around outreach of our businesses and shelter operation.,218,,
986,0.97,8768.893,8772.663,"It is from Councilmember Morales, and we'll have Jeff walk us through it.",218,,
987,0.97,8772.663,8779.804,"Madam chair, this is somewhat similar to proposal number 12 and some ones that we'll get to shortly.",219,,
988,0.97,8779.804,8792.683,"It provides $98,000 in this case, and it's specifically the type of agency that would receive these types of Funs, as specified as representing black, indigenous, and people of color who have lived the experience of homelessness.",219,,
989,0.97,8792.683,8802.393,"In this case, the focus will be on the Columbia city and Rainier Beach neighborhoods.",219,,
990,0.97,8802.393,8805.63,It's proposed by Councilmember Morales.,219,,
991,0.97,8805.63,8807.965,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",220,,
992,0.97,8807.965,8808.399,Please go ahead.,220,,
993,0.97,8808.399,8808.766,Thank you.,221,,
994,0.97,8808.766,8813.07,"Yeah, I'm really glad to see so you many of my colleagues are seeing the value of this work.",221,,
995,0.97,8813.07,8823.447,I think we are all hearing from our constituents about the need for additional outreach.,221,,
996,0.97,8823.447,8829.187,For somebody to serve as a liaison with our neighborhood commercial districts.,221,,
997,0.97,8829.187,8843.634,"So much like my colleagues who are requesting funds for similar positions, you know, I've certainly Heared from my constituents about the need for more homelessness outreach in our district.",221,,
998,0.97,8843.634,8857.715,"So we are requesting, or submitting a form a to be able to fund a position particularly in the Columbia city business area, and in the Rainier valley.",221,,
999,0.97,8857.715,8858.082,Excellent.,222,,
1000,0.97,8858.082,8864.055,I'm not seeing any questions on that.,222,,
1001,0.97,8864.055,8864.855,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",222,,
1002,0.97,8864.855,8865.056,Okay.,222,,
1003,0.97,8865.056,8866.591,Item number 15.,222,,
1004,0.97,8866.591,8883.241,"Number 15 on the next slide is related to the NAV App, which is the application software that has been used by the city's navigation team to track the people they came into contact with, and the outcomes of those engagements and referrals, and things like that.",223,,
1005,0.97,8883.241,8895.553,"This would add funds to request homeless providers, so our contract agencies, with the tools and training that they need in order to be able to utilize that application.",223,,
1006,0.97,8895.553,8900.858,This is put forward by Councilmember Herbold.,223,,
1007,0.97,8900.858,8902.126,Councilmember Herbold.,224,,
1008,0.97,8902.126,8906.731,Thank you so much.,224,,
1009,0.97,8906.731,8907.331,Just Becausing for a second.,224,,
1010,0.97,8907.331,8914.438,"Yeah, so this item is one that we pulled together early on.",225,,
1011,0.97,8914.438,8930.688,"My primary interest is making sure that contracted outreach providers have access to their Realtime information about shelter availability, and the ability to make direct referrals, as they're interacting with people living in shelter.",225,,
1012,0.97,8930.688,8938.796,I want to make sure that we eliminate any process barrier that helps them from helping people access shelter.,225,,
1013,0.97,8938.796,8942.6,Access to the NAV App may or may not be the best way to accomplish this.,225,,
1014,0.97,8942.6,8952.977,I'm continuing my discussions with providers on the best way to accomplish this goal.,225,,
1015,0.97,8952.977,8953.311,That's it.,225,,
1016,0.97,8953.311,8956.047,Thanks so much.,226,,
1017,0.97,8956.047,8959.784,Are there any questions?,226,,
1018,0.97,8959.784,8959.984,Okay.,226,,
1019,0.97,8959.984,8963.454,Look forward to learning more about this as well.,226,,
1020,0.97,8963.454,8970.161,In terms of what dollar amount we're talking about.,226,,
1021,0.97,8970.161,8970.961,Thank you.,226,,
1022,0.97,8970.961,8974.465,Let's move on.,226,,
1023,0.97,8974.465,8976.467,The last two items.,226,,
1024,0.97,8976.467,8979.136,Item number 16 is homelessness outreach.,227,,
1025,0.97,8979.136,8995.086,"In this case, West Seattle, and the South Park area as it has a lot of similarities with two earlier proposals, providing a liaison between individuals and businesses, and community leaders in that area.",227,,
1026,0.97,8995.086,8995.419,Great.,228,,
1027,0.97,8995.419,8997.755,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",228,,
1028,0.97,8997.755,9010.634,"As mentioned, this item has some similarity with other Councilmember requests.",229,,
1029,0.97,9010.634,9032.757,"I think the specific, unique issue for my district is we do have reach going to visit district one, once a week, and that's very welcome, but the closure on with the West Seattle bridge puts a strain on providers who are not based in district one.",229,,
1030,0.97,9032.757,9048.472,"So the idea is to put more possible for us to have somebody that's based in district one, serving ot only West Seattle, but South Park as well.",229,,
1031,0.97,9048.472,9050.441,You make excellent points.,230,,
1032,0.97,9050.441,9051.342,Thank you so much.,230,,
1033,0.97,9051.342,9056.313,This bridge is effecting all aspects of life out here.,230,,
1034,0.97,9056.313,9060.885,"Any questions, colleagues?",230,,
1035,0.97,9060.885,9061.118,Okay.,230,,
1036,0.97,9061.118,9063.754,"Councilmember Juarez, any calls from you?",230,,
1037,0.97,9063.754,9065.723,I do have you off mute.,230,,
1038,0.97,9065.723,9066.69,I'm great.,231,,
1039,0.97,9066.69,9071.095,Let's do the last item along a similar vein.,232,,
1040,0.97,9071.095,9074.365,"Councilmember Strauss, and I'll turn over Jeff to walk us through it.",232,,
1041,0.97,9074.365,9105.362,"As Councilmembers are aware, last year, the budget continued funding to the agencies that serve as the project program managers to provide outreach in the U district and dollar and this would build on that, to provide homelessness, outreach, clean up, and security services towards two of the community in the area, working in collaboration in this area, and is a an emphasis put forward by Councilmember Strauss.",233,,
1042,0.97,9105.362,9107.198,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",234,,
1043,0.97,9107.198,9109.567,Please go ahead.,234,,

1045,0.97,9111.836,9112.269,"Thank you, Jeff.",235,,
1046,0.97,9112.269,9125.916,"As Jeff mentioned, several Bia's, including the Ballard alliance, and District alliance have previously contracted to provide outreach to conduct outreach in their neighborhoods.",235,,
1047,0.97,9125.916,9147.605,"These programs continue to be popular with businesses and residents of those neighborhoods, and provide a way that keeps law enforcement focused on more higher uses of their time and ensures that reach outreach workers are the first group of people to interact with those people in crisis.",235,,
1048,0.97,9147.605,9164.655,"My proposal would increase the funding for those services, as well as for clean up and security services for Bia's, since the Unactivated hours of our business districts have increased from 4:00 to 6:00 a.m., today within the pandemic, the Unactivated hours are from about midnight to 6:00 A.M.",235,,

1051,0.97,9178.102,9184.875,Perhaps if we could also fold in Morales as well to see if the D2 outreach is in a similar wane.,236,,
1052,0.97,9184.875,9186.21,Welcome.,237,,
1053,0.97,9186.21,9187.044,That's welcome.,237,,
1054,0.97,9187.044,9187.545,Thank you.,238,,
1055,0.97,9187.545,9189.713,Thank you.,239,,
1056,0.97,9189.713,9191.215,"Colleagues, questions on this one.",240,,
1057,0.97,9191.215,9200.457,"Great, thank you very much, Councilmember Strauss for thinking about your district, yes, and how this applies across the city as well.",240,,
1058,0.97,9200.457,9202.126,I really appreciate you bringing that forward.,240,,
1059,0.97,9202.126,9204.728,That brings us to the end of the specific areas.,240,,
1060,0.97,9204.728,9218.475,"Before we go into other proposals, I want to see if any Councilmembers would like to make some comments and first offer our Council President the chance to Chime in.",240,,
1061,0.97,9218.475,9219.81,"Thank you, chairman Mosqueda.",241,,
1062,0.97,9219.81,9289.98,"I just thought it would be important at the end of the homelessness outreach section to mention that I think that it is really important that we continue to invest in these areas and I'm really happy to see so many proposals in the homelessness outreach area that are innovative and some are expansion of prior, past investments that we've made in this area, and, you know, I think that what I wanted to share was that I was on a call last week with Leo floor from King County, who mentioned, and reminded folks on the call, that as it relates to homelessness outreach one of the system gaps is that we have as a city and a County, invested quite a bit of dollars in programs that support outreach to our unsheltered relatives and neighbors throughout the region.",241,,
1063,0.97,9289.98,9294.251,And I don't think he was making an argument to reduce those investments.,241,,
1064,0.97,9294.251,9314.038,"I think he was making an argument that it's important for us to continue to invest in outreach, while also making sure that we are in the same vein and Commensurately investing in places to send people to that are appropriate for those individuals.",241,,
1065,0.97,9314.038,9341.765,"And as I look at this budget, both the one proposed by the Mayor, and some of these Councilmember proposals through budget actions, I still don't have a clear sense of whether, or how these outreach services are matched, I suppose for lack of a better term, with places to refer people to.",241,,
1066,0.97,9341.765,9397.221,"I did see something related to tiny homes and I think that's super important, but I want to make sure that we have an opportunity here from Jeff and others on Council central staff about how our homelessness outreach dollars and investments compare in scale to what the city and, you know, the region, as we think about the regional authorities are investing in terms of brick and mortar for where we are sending people to, and referring people to, in sort of the what I think is an expected natural Biproduct of outreach investments.",241,,
1067,0.97,9397.221,9399.456,"Well said, thank you Council President.",242,,
1068,0.97,9399.456,9413.437,"Appreciate you bringing that up, and I see Lewis K on the line, I'm happy to open that question up, and I have a question that duck tails on that.",242,,
1069,0.97,9413.437,9425.716,"I'm happy to do a similar analysis, I don't have a dollars to dollars comparison, that might be useful, or a comparison to how other jurisdictions handle that approach, so I'm happy to work further on that.",243,,
1070,0.97,9425.716,9443.333,"I will note that the Council receives reports on the outcomes that the Navigational team has achieved over 2019, and 2020, and most significantly as the executive highlighted, there was a dramatic improve.",243,,
1071,0.97,9443.333,9450.007,"In outcomes for the Navigational team, opening the approximately 192 beds in the shelter and the ability to place people.",243,,
1072,0.97,9450.007,9475.866,"So I think that the point that the Councilmember is making, the more options we have to move people into a shelter space, the structure that people are willing to move into, and then also into out of those shelters, which are temporary, into a true housing situation, as one of seen that expand, that has yielded its more success for our outreach providers.",243,,
1073,0.97,9475.866,9476.633,Anything else?,244,,
1074,0.97,9476.633,9476.967,Go ahead.,244,,
1075,0.97,9476.967,9485.409,"Jeff, I think that last comment you made is really important, right?",245,,
1076,0.97,9485.409,9516.206,"Because if we're just engaging in outreach, and I'm not saying that we just engage in outreach, but if we don't have appropriate offers of permanent, or transition housing for folks that we're doing outreach to, then, we're sort of accepting that we're doing outreach for purposes of providing services in field, but not for purposes of connecting people.",245,,
1077,0.97,9516.206,9518.876,So something better than living outside.,245,,
1078,0.97,9518.876,9544.468,"So I do think that in terms of this particular issue, it's both an investment question, right, are we investing at the scale needed for brick and mortar, that is commensurate, or greater than the type of outreach services that we are providing?",245,,
1079,0.97,9544.468,9578.535,"And then Secondly, related to that is, does, if there is a heavy investment in that outreach, as compared to brick and mortar options to transition people to, then is that out of line with our strategies, broadly speaking, about how the system should be squarely focused on not just outreach, but outreach plus housing, right?",245,,
1080,0.97,9578.535,9599.089,"So I think I worry that we haven't done, you know robust analysis of how the outreach meaningfully connects to providing people options that are designed for their unique needs, right, because we know that the Unhoused population is not a monolith.",245,,
1081,0.97,9599.089,9621.411,"And if we're not doing that, then I think we need to reevaluate where we're setting the dials in this space so that we are doing outreach that is actually going to turn into placement in something more stable, and permanent.",245,,
1082,0.97,9621.411,9622.312,"Thank you, Council President.",246,,
1083,0.97,9622.312,9625.148,I also want to Chime in here.,246,,
1084,0.97,9625.148,9647.804,"I think it is the latter question, as you articulated, Council President, and this goes to every ride along, every conversation we've had with outreach workers, there's nowhere to navigate to, if the shelters are at capacity, there's nowhere to build up space.",246,,
1085,0.97,9647.804,9678.402,"I really appreciate you underscoring that point, it does dove tail into the conversation we need to have in terms of our proposed budget, and the ways we had assumed that the jump start funding would be used in 2022, knowing that 70% of the funds we had appropriated for jump start would go into housing that we had hoped that those dollars would allow for office of housing to free up funding that they were holding for 2022, and front load that into 2021.",246,,
1086,0.97,9678.402,9697.421,"Aly, I'm hoping that maybe you can provide some context into that issue, and even with that Clairefication, clarification that point is very valid.",246,,
1087,0.97,9697.421,9701.925,"After Aly, I'll turn to Councilmember Herbold.",246,,
1088,0.97,9701.925,9702.993,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",247,,
1089,0.97,9702.993,9715.739,"I would agree with all of what has been said, I think having sort of a variety of types of interventions is important here and having some flexibility in the funding.",247,,
1090,0.97,9715.739,9732.456,"I think as you mentioned, council adopted the jump start spending plan, and in 2021, the focus was primarily on expanded Covid relief, and continuity of services.",247,,
1091,0.97,9732.456,9746.203,"So the idea would be to spend, have additional dollars available in 2022 for investments in housing as well as the equitable development initiative.",247,,
1092,0.97,9746.203,9764.02,"There is not a proposal for the 2022 budget before you now in looking a the financial plans in looking at the proposed budget, it is not assuming that those additional dollars will be included in the office of housing's budget.",247,,
1093,0.97,9764.02,9801.091,"And in fact, most of the funds would be used to continue supporting ongoing base of budget needs, and then it's unclear whether or not there's about $100 million, the budget book does to say the proposal or the equitable communities initiative is ongoing, so our assumption is that that money, that is really freed up from the payroll tax proceeds would be used for that purpose and not specifically for the housing investments proposed in the jump start spending plan.",247,,
1094,0.97,9801.091,9809.966,"So it's difficult to tie up funds for 2022 through the 2021 budget, but I'm not sure if I'm anticipating your question.",247,,
1095,0.97,9809.966,9823.313,"I'm just confirming that right now it does not appear that the intention is to program the pro seeds from the payroll tax of 2022 and beyond for housing, but that will be a question for the Council next year.",247,,
1096,0.97,9823.313,9825.582,"Which is very problematic, right?",248,,
1097,0.97,9825.582,9830.22,"We all agree to do a one year budget, because of the crisis that Covid is presenting.",248,,
1098,0.97,9830.22,9837.227,"But for us, agreeing to just have 12 months in front of us, we would have levers to address 2022 spending.",248,,
1099,0.97,9837.227,9843.333,"And I think that, thank you for Articulating that.",248,,
1100,0.97,9843.333,9845.101,I know we've uncovered that in the past.,248,,
1101,0.97,9845.101,9852.909,"We must have a way for us to not just put a band aid on the solution and do outreach, and get folks into temporary shelter.",248,,
1102,0.97,9852.909,9853.743,Even the best temporary shelter.,248,,
1103,0.97,9853.743,9856.279,We really need to be creating that housing stability.,248,,
1104,0.97,9856.279,9871.661,So I will look forward to working with all of you and central staff to see if there's anything else we can do to ensure that the spending in 2022 is as adhered to as the council passed.,248,,
1105,0.97,9871.661,9877.1,We've got criticized in past years for not having a quote spend plan when we had one.,248,,
1106,0.97,9877.1,9891.648,"There's no doubt that what we massed was a detailed spend plan to get out exactly this concern about housing, affordable housing, being constantly put on the back Burner.",248,,
1107,0.97,9891.648,9919.009,"This is very important for us to make sure that spend plan is adhered to, especially because I believe we'd like to explore if the funding can going to go where the Council had directed, then there's the possibility we could offload some of those housing dollars for 2022, and put more into housing in 2021.",248,,
1108,0.97,9919.009,9921.511,"Aly, anything before Congress Councilmember Herbold?",248,,
1109,0.97,9921.511,9947.237,"I want to also just acknowledge that I think this has been, the counsel, and previous councils have been moving in this direction for some time and some of you have been part of that and will continue to be, some of that funding that will provide about 600 units of permanent housing, next year, and will free up spaces in a shelter.",249,,
1110,0.97,9947.237,9961.051,"It demonstrates the need to have that sort of path to transition through, as well as Partnering with the county and other regional entities and sort of getting more housing Online.",249,,
1111,0.97,9961.051,9961.618,Councilmember Herbold?,250,,
1112,0.97,9961.618,9978.068,"I think what I was going to say is covered much better than I could have covered by yourself, chair Mosqueda, and central staff, I was just going to talk about the 2022 plans for jump start.",251,,
1113,0.97,9978.068,9978.435,So thank you.,251,,
1114,0.97,9978.435,9978.802,Thank you.,252,,
1115,0.97,9978.802,9982.972,Thank you for reminding us about that.,252,,
1116,0.97,9982.972,9985.041,Councilmember Gonzalez to close us out.,252,,
1117,0.97,9985.041,9993.049,"Sorry, it took me a minute to find my mute button.",253,,
1118,0.97,9993.049,9995.185,"Yeah, I appreciate that conversation.",253,,
1119,0.97,9995.185,10005.128,"I just, I guess from my perspective, this is much more than just a conversation about the revenue source.",253,,
1120,0.97,10005.128,10012.702,"You know, I appreciate the points that you, chair Mosqueda, and Councilmember Herbold are making.",253,,
1121,0.97,10012.702,10014.738,I'm not being Dismissive of those points.,253,,
1122,0.97,10014.738,10040.363,"I think those are very important points to make sure that we are advancing the Council's priorities around meaningful interventions that will be available to both on the prevention side in terms of housing Affordability, and also on the options for housing for folks who are currently experiencing homelessness.",253,,
1123,0.97,10040.363,10060.617,"But I want us to really have a conversation, not so much about the funding source, but more about the bigger question of where we're Outreaching people to.",253,,
1124,0.97,10060.617,10073.763,"How does outreach services programs that we are funding intentionally, and deliberately connect to placements in something that is not just emergency shelter.",253,,
1125,0.97,10073.763,10110.767,"And, I think it's important for us to have emergency shelter, but I also think that it's important for us to you know, continue to evaluate and ask the difficult questions of Hsd around how does this, how do these outreach services intentionally connect to placement in, into those Acin Thoseaffordable housing options in counsel through other general fund dollars.",253,,
1126,0.97,10110.767,10145.969,"So I think, I just want to, for purposes of clarifying what my line of inquiry, and comments were, is that I want to, you know, have an opportunity to just clarify that I obviously support the work around the revenue, but I also, ink there's more than just, there's both the funding question, and a strategies question about how those interventions are connecting with the outreach work that we are doing, so that we aren't left with a question of outreach to where.",253,,
1127,0.97,10145.969,10146.803,Councilmember Herbold.,254,,
1128,0.97,10146.803,10155.011,"One of the budget items that I mentioned, number 15 here, is intended to partially get at that issue.",255,,
1129,0.97,10155.011,10170.56,Because one of the things that we hear from outreach workers is they don't have access to the sort of earmarked spaces that the NAV team has historically had access to.,255,,
1130,0.97,10170.56,10202.191,"So the thought is by using the NAV App, which has Realtime information, not only could we be insuring that outreach providers are providing the data to the city, that the city requires for determining whether or not providers are meeting their contracted outcomes, but it would also give the outreach providers access to the information, Realtime information about where there are actual vacancies.",255,,
1131,0.97,10202.191,10205.995,That's a sort of a logistic part of the question.,255,,
1132,0.97,10205.995,10221.077,"But I think to be hair to the executive, and to Hsd, I do think they have put some thought into this and I understand that there is interest on the Council in moving in another direction.",255,,
1133,0.97,10221.077,10234.524,"But what I've heard them explain as it relates to the 300 units that they're looking to bring on in December, it's that those units are intended to be the place where people from outside go to.",255,,
1134,0.97,10234.524,10261.784,"And that's what I Referenced earlier today, when I was talking about the fact that one of the things that the provider communities are, the outreach providers in our discussions around the changes that we need to make to the NAV team to stand up this new outreach model, is what the sort of the placement policy is going to be.",255,,
1135,0.97,10261.784,10277.433,Will it be the outreach providers that now have access to these new 300 spaces to refer people to them with the idea that those 300 spaces are not intended to be permanent.,255,,
1136,0.97,10277.433,10282.939,"They're intended, people are intended to move from there to permanent supportive housing.",255,,
1137,0.97,10282.939,10309.532,"So I do think that, I'm not saying they've come up with a perfect solution, but I do some time into thinking about this outreach to where question, and I do admit to being a little bit, I understand that the interest in buying hotels instead of leasing rooms is about helping providers have a permanent asset.",255,,
1138,0.97,10309.532,10320.81,"You know, making the service dollars last longer and you know, again having hotels that you can convert to be permanent supportive housing.",255,,
1139,0.97,10320.81,10336.726,"I am concerned though, that it kind of disrupts the intervention that the executive's trying to stand up for to answer specifically that through put question.",255,,
1140,0.97,10336.726,10339.829,Thank you very much.,256,,
1141,0.97,10339.829,10340.863,I appreciate this conversation.,256,,
1142,0.97,10340.863,10356.045,"As somebody who has continued to try to push to get more funding into housing along with many of you over the last few years, this is how we are going to create a healthy, thriving, local economy and prevent people from being able to get sick.",256,,
1143,0.97,10356.045,10360.75,Prevent people from being able to cycle out into homelessness.,256,,
1144,0.97,10360.75,10367.256,So we will definitely be bringing this issue back up as we continue our conversations around the budget.,256,,
1145,0.97,10367.256,10373.996,"We have five more items to get through, we're going to go slightly over 5:00 p.m., so I hope folks will stay with us.",256,,
1146,0.97,10373.996,10377.533,But I do want to note that my comments are also not just about the fund source.,256,,
1147,0.97,10377.533,10382.105,"We have had a lot of Coronavirus about that, I get it.",256,,
1148,0.97,10382.105,10402.825,"But my comments were really about how, if office of housing were given the ability to actually assume that the jump start dollars were actually real, what we could assume for the 2021 investment is three times the amount in the Nova investments for housing.",256,,
1149,0.97,10402.825,10405.928,So building the units that people need to get out of shelters.,256,,
1150,0.97,10405.928,10410.833,"We estimate that housing would bring in $132 million, and some of that would be home ownership.",256,,
1151,0.97,10410.833,10443.866,"Some of that would be rental units, some of that would be for the operation and maintenance, and we, I think have an opportunity in front of us, given this question that's been posed, and I think the real need to make sure people have an exit out of that shelter into something real, both for the people who are trying to Stably House people, and for the outreach workers trying to get people off the street, and into some form of housing and shelter, they need to have spaces freed up, and those spaces should be freed up in tiny houses or shelters by allowing people to be in more permanent stable housing.",256,,
1152,0.97,10443.866,10466.756,"I think the big question I'm laying on the table is not necessarily about the funding source, but really how we appreciate, or how do we ensure that the office of housing is allowed to factor in the jump start funding, beginning in 2022, so that in 2021, in this budget, we can actually see three times the amount of dollars going into the Nova program.",256,,
1153,0.97,10466.756,10469.492,"Aly, anything on that before we go?",256,,
1154,0.97,10469.492,10491.38,"Yeah, I just wanted to add to what you're saying there in the need for funding, in order to have places to navigate people too, with the levy ending, I think in 2023, and not knowing about that and the decisions to commit some of the levy funds in previous years to get more units Online now.",257,,
1155,0.97,10491.38,10509.298,"Having that additional source of funds will be important to be able to move quickly when there are opportunities like we saw this year with some, the Mid-Year Nova for the permanent support of housing projects.",257,,
1156,0.97,10509.298,10510.333,Very exciting conversation.,258,,
1157,0.97,10510.333,10519.141,"And really one that is about creating economic stability for families in our local region, and really appreciate the conversation.",258,,
1158,0.97,10519.141,10529.452,"Let's do the last five, and then we will ask for your indulgence to read through the memo on Covid response, and Aly is available for that as well.",258,,
1159,0.97,10529.452,10535.658,But we will get through this presentation and that will be it for today.,258,,
1160,0.97,10535.658,10538.461,Number 18 is rental assistance for families.,259,,
1161,0.97,10538.461,10553.276,"This is a proposal to increase the amount of rental assistance funds that are available, and that precise population will be children in child care settings or in Seattle schools.",259,,
1162,0.97,10553.276,10554.41,This is from Councilmember Gonzalez.,259,,
1163,0.97,10554.41,10560.816,"Just really briefly, I think it's pretty self-explanatory here.",260,,
1164,0.97,10560.816,10577.833,"But the intent here is to have some targeted investments for populations that we know are particularly vulnerable, and those are of course families with children who are currently in Childcare, or Seattle public schools.",260,,
1165,0.97,10577.833,10595.284,We are still exploring what the revenue source would be and working through a potential number that we hope to have crystallized by tomorrow for form B submission.,260,,
1166,0.97,10595.284,10596.419,"Thank you, manager.",260,,
1167,0.97,10596.419,10601.891,"Sorry, I was going to say, I cannot stay past 5:00 P.M.",260,,
1168,0.97,10601.891,10614.07,"My second item, my form a is item number 21, and I was hoping to ask for the chair's indulgence to allow me to address item 21 out of order.",260,,
1169,0.97,10614.07,10616.839,I think it's item 22.,261,,
1170,0.97,10616.839,10621.611,We can definitely do that.,261,,
1171,0.97,10621.611,10623.913,"Jeff, do you mind summarizing 22 quickly?",261,,
1172,0.97,10623.913,10653.709,"Sure, this is a request to examine the appropriations provided for the King County regional homelessness authority, given the delays that we've seen in implementing the stand up of the regional authority and there are continuing plans to transfer Úcontract management, and ownership of those to authority, but given those delays to examine the cost impacts of that, and Feasibilities, and Councilmember Gonzalez.",262,,
1173,0.97,10653.709,10660.683,It is listed as 21 on this slide.,263,,
1174,0.97,10660.683,10661.25,Sorry for the Coronavirus.,263,,
1175,0.97,10661.25,10663.552,Confusion.,264,,
1176,0.97,10663.552,10673.596,"Really quickly, I want to continue to signal my support for the efforts of the homelessness authority.",265,,
1177,0.97,10673.596,10679.735,Jeff in particular already highlighted this as an issue identification by central staff.,265,,
1178,0.97,10679.735,10692.348,I submitted a form in part because we did not have enough time to discuss this item during the Hsd Department budget overview presentation that occurred earlier this month.,265,,
1179,0.97,10692.348,10710.466,So I wanted to make sure that we use this form to continue the conversation around the city's plan to move significant resources and functions out of the human services Department into the King County regional homelessness Authorityat some point in 2021.,265,,
1180,0.97,10710.466,10741.63,"As we know, the implementation Timeline has been delayed by months for many reasons, including the, you know, need to more appropriately staff the live experience Cohort resources to continue to meaningfully engage both in sensitive policy questions, but also in many of the issues related to hiring the Ceo.",265,,
1181,0.97,10741.63,10744.467,"So again, you know I remain committed to this.",265,,
1182,0.97,10744.467,10762.318,"I think the city in general remains committed to this effort, but given the implementation Timeline, I think there is a question for the Council to consider during our budget process, which is our biggest leverage point as partners in this effort.",265,,
1183,0.97,10762.318,10794.75,"It is, I think incumbent upon us to evaluate the proposal made by the Mayor in terms of the implementation question for 2021, and you know Colleagus I would be Remiss, in mentioning while I have a strong commitment and belief in this effort, I continue to be cautiously optimistic about the direction that we're headed here for those of you who missed the news.",265,,
1184,0.97,10794.75,10833.889,"Eight of our suburban cities in King County recently voted to oppose a 1/10Th of a cent sales tax at the local level, deciding instead to take a different approach and choosing to house, excuse me, to pass proposal that would focus on funding a higher income threshold than what the county has proposed through its sales tax proposal.",265,,
1185,0.97,10833.889,10834.89,That was unfortunate news.,265,,
1186,0.97,10834.89,10844.567,And I think that it presents a little bit of a signal into the work that we need to continue to do to be on the same page as a region.,265,,
1187,0.97,10844.567,10864.119,"But that, setting that aside, at some point in 2021, we all know that the plan is for the city of Seattle to transfer around $73 million worth of human services contracts, and the staffing, and administrative resources related to those contracts to the regional homelessness authority.",265,,
1188,0.97,10864.119,10881.77,"But it's still unclear exactly how soon the Rha's administration will be stood up, and I think we need to be cognizant of this while making budgetary decisions about Hsd and the management of these resources and contracts.",265,,
1189,0.97,10881.77,10911.967,"So we should consider whether it would be appropriate to maintain more resources and staff at Hsd in 2021 in order to continue Affective management of homeless and service contracts currently administered by Hsd, while we continue to attempt to stand up the Rha through the King County regional homeless governing committee and the implementation board.",265,,
1190,0.97,10911.967,10929.918,"I'm happy to continue having conversations with you colleagues about whether it's a phased strategy, and phased approach, whether this takes the form of a proviso that is dependent on implementation success at the Rha.",265,,
1191,0.97,10929.918,10964.253,"So I think there's many ways to address the concerns I've expressed, and some of the concerns that the chair expressed she's heard from frontline service providers and workers over at Hsd, and this form a is submitted by need with that intent around those proposed dollars, and look forward to submitting a form B to continue to allow us to evaluate alternatives and strategies to this question.",265,,
1192,0.97,10964.253,10971.493,"Thank you very much, Council President.",266,,
1193,0.97,10971.493,10971.794,Questions?,266,,
1194,0.97,10971.794,10972.127,Seeing none.,266,,
1195,0.97,10972.127,10972.328,Okay.,266,,
1196,0.97,10972.328,10972.761,Three more items.,266,,
1197,0.97,10972.761,10978.534,"Councilmember Sawant, you with up next.",266,,
1198,0.97,10978.534,10978.901,Item number 19.,266,,
1199,0.97,10978.901,10983.405,24 hour operations.,266,,
1200,0.97,10983.405,10989.211,"Sure, I'll give some background context.",267,,
1201,0.97,10989.211,11000.823,"There are a number of basic shelters operated by the city, because of the changes they're in, or providing their services for 24 hours, so a person can stay there the entire time.",267,,
1202,0.97,11000.823,11011.033,"This proposal is to allow them to continue doing so going forward, as proposed by Congress member Sawant.",267,,
1203,0.97,11011.033,11022.144,"Thank you Jeff, some of what I will say will definitely overlap with the background Jeff has already given.",268,,
1204,0.97,11022.144,11029.985,"This budget will at $577,000 with nonprofit organizations to maintain 24 hour operations of basic shelters.",268,,
1205,0.97,11029.985,11050.506,"Sharon will operate South manage basic shelters as we number the basic shelters are the shelters that do not have many of the services provided, because there aren't enough shelters overall, and there isn't enough shelter space in Seattle, I think we need to protect every shelter bed.",268,,
1206,0.97,11050.506,11061.55,It allows them to build a community in a way that shelters aren't able to.,268,,
1207,0.97,11061.55,11067.923,"And environments themselves that it is really working for them, and they want to build on it.",268,,
1208,0.97,11067.923,11084.206,"This year the basic shelters provided extra funding to allow them to provide 24 hour services instead of just being overnight, which is essential to keep people safe during Covid, but even without Covid, a 24 hour shelter is a huge improvement compared to overnight.",268,,
1209,0.97,11084.206,11089.445,"For housed people, imagine not being able to go home during the day, even to use the bathroom.",268,,
1210,0.97,11089.445,11099.221,"So the residents have been fighting to maintain the 24 hour shelter operations for 2021, and this budget amend would make that funding possible.",268,,
1211,0.97,11099.221,11100.155,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",269,,
1212,0.97,11100.155,11100.456,Questions.,269,,
1213,0.97,11100.456,11105.627,I was just surprised by the low dollar amount associated with this.,270,,
1214,0.97,11105.627,11113.735,"And is it because it's only associated with two locations, or how many locations are we talking about here?",270,,
1215,0.97,11113.735,11115.938,Anybody?,270,,
1216,0.97,11115.938,11123.645,"I believe we're talking about two, but to be honest with you, we're not entirely sure.",271,,
1217,0.97,11123.645,11126.715,But I'd be happy to get back to you on that.,271,,
1218,0.97,11126.715,11135.924,"But overall, I can say the reason it's a small amount, and I'm glad you raised that, is because it's basic shelter services.",271,,
1219,0.97,11135.924,11137.893,"Jeff, do you have anything to add?",272,,
1220,0.97,11137.893,11139.795,I don't have anything anymore.,273,,
1221,0.97,11139.795,11144.633,I want to thank Councilmember Sawant for bringing this forward.,274,,
1222,0.97,11144.633,11166.288,"I did some preliminary inquiries with Hsd about the issue of what it would cost to insure that we do not lose any, any beds associated with our Deintensification efforts.",274,,
1223,0.97,11166.288,11180.435,The 2021 budget provides some additional funding to maintain some of the R Rfp Deintensification efforts.,274,,
1224,0.97,11180.435,11192.781,"But there are some programs that are not receiving additional funds for 2021, share wheel is one for their 171 beds in a church space.",274,,
1225,0.97,11192.781,11200.923,"Lazarus in St. Maartens also, we could find that they are going to lose beds in 2021.",274,,
1226,0.97,11200.923,11210.465,"And so we've asked the question to maintain the intensification for the agencies, what would it cost?",274,,
1227,0.97,11210.465,11234.923,And the response that we got from the executive is that the Dchs over at King County is working with the agencies to identify a permanent solution and the funding needed to support the Deintensified beds into hotels in 2021.,274,,
1228,0.97,11234.923,11249.104,"But we have not yet, and we have contacted King County to find out if that's indeed the case, that they are working with these agencies to identify a permanent solution, but we have not yet heard back.",274,,
1229,0.97,11249.104,11267.022,"So again, really appreciate Councilmember Sawant taking this on for share wheel, but also note that there are 20 beds at Ajelines.",274,,
1230,0.97,11267.022,11270.392,338 at Dsc.,274,,
1231,0.97,11270.392,11271.86,Dsc beds in hotels there.,274,,
1232,0.97,11271.86,11281.903,"16 beds from Lazarus that are in hotels, and 102 beds from St. Martins that are in hotels.",274,,
1233,0.97,11281.903,11289.444,This is a huge area that I think we need to figure out how to work a permanent solution for 2021.,274,,
1234,0.97,11289.444,11290.712,Appreciate that.,275,,
1235,0.97,11290.712,11291.179,Councilmember Sawant.,275,,
1236,0.97,11291.179,11296.318,I appreciate Councilmember Herbold sharing that information.,276,,
1237,0.97,11296.318,11301.556,And I hope Councilmembers will support this budget amendment now.,276,,
1238,0.97,11301.556,11308.897,"And if we understand about expansion of it, to include other shelters, we would be happy to support that too, of course.",276,,
1239,0.97,11308.897,11312.3,Thank you so much.,277,,
1240,0.97,11312.3,11319.608,"Yeah, when I read in $650,000, I thought for all shelters across Seattle, why haven't we done this before?",277,,
1241,0.97,11319.608,11330.986,"So if the price tag is slightly different, obviously, I look forward to seeing that information, but I appreciate both of your comments and the urgency of this issue in 2021.",277,,
1242,0.97,11330.986,11334.79,Let's go onto Councilmember Erbold's number 20.,277,,
1243,0.97,11334.79,11348.704,"As a matter of introduction, the social service provider provides the opportunity for investment for individuals that work at homeless, and housing agencies in Seattle.",278,,
1244,0.97,11348.704,11355.911,"This proposal would provide $100,000 to pour a navigator position related to that program, that I imagine Councilmember Herbold is going to speak more to.",278,,
1245,0.97,11355.911,11358.78,So I will turn it over to her.,278,,
1246,0.97,11358.78,11359.915,Thank you so much.,279,,

1251,0.97,11383.472,11403.658,"The budget request is for $100,000 to fund the navigator who works to disperse the direct student support, which then is used for the support needed by the students from, anything from light utility bills to Childcare needs to bus passes.",279,,

1259,0.97,11453.542,11454.543,Any questions on that?,280,,
1260,0.97,11454.543,11455.877,Thank you very much.,280,,
1261,0.97,11455.877,11471.159,I do want to just check in to see how this might interact with some of our 1199 homeless service providers in the work and the training as an area of interest.,280,,
1262,0.97,11471.159,11474.496,The last one is mine and I promise to keep it short.,280,,

1265,0.97,11491.313,11496.284,Ly leave it open to say I'm very open to working with other Councilmembers on this issue.,282,,
