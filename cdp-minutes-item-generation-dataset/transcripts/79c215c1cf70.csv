88,0.97,865.03,880.012,If the Council put these in place it will force this to rise prices to consumers including paying Dasher's like myself.,12,,

174,0.97,1562.594,1569.0,We did not work with third parties due to the 30% Commission.,31,,
175,0.97,1569.0,1576.975,We came to rely on the services because of the 15% Commission cap.,31,,
176,0.97,1576.975,1580.845,These deliveries began to represent half of our sales.,31,,
177,0.97,1580.845,1600.332,"Third-party delivery services were an important tool for restaurants and helped us made it through an impossibly difficult time . As customers have returned to dining in, customers continue to rely on third-party delivery as a routine option.",31,,

179,0.97,1604.703,1610.842,"The rationale for capping this is a sound today as ever, maybe more.",31,,
180,0.97,1610.842,1629.06,"Unless fees are permanently capped at 15%, we will expect high commissions to return, and that will force impossible choices on her network of locally owned restaurants like myself.",31,,
181,0.97,1629.06,1629.861,We will opt out.,31,,
182,0.97,1629.861,1639.07,It will mean reduced business for delivery drivers and reduced sales and reduced opportunities for us as a business.,31,,

193,0.97,1714.212,1721.586,This is important because knowing how to help businesses start and grow in Seattle is not self-evident.,34,,
194,0.97,1721.586,1740.305,"Nor is it obvious that helping Bipoc entrepreneurs create jobs and build generational wealth for themselves, their families, and community is essential to attaining the Anti-Displacement equity and social justice policy goals of the city of Seattle.",34,,

210,0.97,1923.354,1928.66,We have all the right ingredients in this region to lead the nation in the future of equitable economic development.,36,,
211,0.97,1928.66,1948.513,"We have the resources and we have the right set of values to put everything together and figure out what the future of the economy will be like, however, we can only achieve that if we have the right intention, organization and creativity.",36,,

214,0.97,1956.154,1967.432,I'm sorry for being so casual in my introduction.,37,,
215,0.97,1967.432,1978.71,"Council members have submitted questions for the interim director, and they are linked on the agenda.",37,,
216,0.97,1978.71,1984.649,Right now I will open the floor to my colleagues to ask any questions or any Clarifications.,37,,
217,0.97,1984.649,1994.959,Or make any comments.,37,,
218,0.97,1994.959,2003.101,I was waiting for other people to go first.,38,,
219,0.97,2003.101,2005.67,Councilmember Herbold.,38,,
220,0.97,2005.67,2027.792,One of the things in the Q & amp; a--a couple of things I would love to hear you Riff--I want to avoid a variety of broke expectations that we cannot deliver on.,39,,
221,0.97,2027.792,2043.141,Can you talk about what you mean about rogue expectations and how you will address which delayed initiatives fit the Cattery category of rogue expectations.,39,,
222,0.97,2043.141,2055.219,One thing I inquired about was the legacy business initiative I've been working on with director Lee for several years and we are ready to launch a pilot.,39,,
223,0.97,2055.219,2061.759,I was excited about it.,39,,
224,0.97,2061.759,2065.43,I did not see it as a rogue expectation and have been working closely with Oed on that.,39,,
225,0.97,2065.43,2075.039,I just want to hear from you directly on what things you might think of as being rogue expectations.,39,,
226,0.97,2075.039,2076.507,And then I have one more question.,39,,
227,0.97,2076.507,2085.383,"To be clear, I was not meaning to cure to the legacy work as a rogue expectation.",40,,
228,0.97,2085.383,2103.201,"It shows that more and soft conversations were Oed, and I think I have been clear in taking this role that a Foundational thing is Oed needs to be clear about its function in the regional economic Ecosystem.",40,,
229,0.97,2103.201,2106.704,"What we can do, what we cannot do, and where the city can make the most impact.",40,,
230,0.97,2106.704,2117.081,I found working as an outside [Indiscernible] we get stretched and pulled within the city in a variety of different ways.,40,,
231,0.97,2117.081,2135.366,"We get pulled by departments and executives office and counsel and pushed and pulled in different ways so we don't have focus, and it does not allow us to execute and keep priorities that we need to do to make sure the economy is moving forward and evolving.",40,,
232,0.97,2135.366,2145.943,It is more about us being clear in our identity inside and outside the city and sticking to it so we don't dilute our ability to have an impact and,40,,
233,0.97,2145.943,2159.624,You talk a little bit about the stalled legacy business initiative.,41,,
234,0.97,2159.624,2164.161,We were poised to launch and it was going to be small.,41,,
235,0.97,2164.161,2179.777,It was built off of the recommendations of a couple of reports that the Commission had worked consultants on.,41,,
236,0.97,2179.777,2191.389,I had heard loud and clear that folks were concerned--you know--that we were going to be going down this road.,41,,
237,0.97,2191.389,2194.692,Identifying businesses because they've been around for a long time and that was not the case.,41,,
238,0.97,2194.692,2226.39,"Is really about businesses that are integral to communities and focus on Bipoc, cultural gathering places--the thinking is we want to support all small businesses, new as well is old, but all businesses have a special role in the city's history.",41,,
239,0.97,2226.39,2235.132,And identity of a community.,41,,
240,0.97,2235.132,2239.37,"I think our team is working on the specifics around legacy business proposal, including succession planning.",42,,
241,0.97,2239.37,2256.187,"To me, the ideas of legacy business is commercial Affordability, so we are very excited, having been able to work with Federal relief funds to develop new ideas around commercial Affordability.",42,,
242,0.97,2256.187,2262.126,Returning to neighborhoods if they have been displaced.,42,,
243,0.97,2262.126,2274.305,And visiting with a couple of businesses on beacon Hill that were displaced for a variety of reasons and they are working with the landlord to build out new space and return.,42,,
244,0.97,2274.305,2288.619,"There is a continuum of Affordability issues, and we need to figure out where we can make the most impact, where can we help those businesses find the Pathway forward to stabilize and grow.",42,,
245,0.97,2288.619,2291.489,I believe it is a broader issue around commercial Affordability,42,,
246,0.97,2291.489,2313.377,"Closing out, we have legislation regulations tied to the public health state of emergency, the ban on rent increases for small businesses and Nonprofits is one of those bills.",43,,
247,0.97,2313.377,2328.092,Right now there is a ban on rent increases in the city of Seattle for small businesses and Nonprofits that will be going away when the state of emergency is lifted.,43,,
248,0.97,2328.092,2339.937,"I would like to spend time talking to you, and the chair about if there is something that should be put in its place.",43,,
249,0.97,2339.937,2343.974,Thank you.,44,,
250,0.97,2343.974,2349.747,I think I wrote into counsel when legacy businesses was in development.,44,,
251,0.97,2349.747,2356.687,I had a question about which businesses the city is targeting to help.,44,,
252,0.97,2356.687,2370.334,"The resources of Oed are very thin and my question, I believe back then was should we be helping businesses that are already well-established?",44,,
253,0.97,2370.334,2403.167,"Or should we help businesses that are new and struggling to get a foothold, many owned by immigrant families and owning a small test--[Indiscernible] policies are applied and if they benefit--if they benefit our constituents in a consistent manner.",44,,
254,0.97,2403.167,2407.938,We can continue talking about that.,44,,
255,0.97,2407.938,2414.445,"& GT; good morning, to both of you.",45,,
256,0.97,2414.445,2416.714,I am very excited to have you here.,45,,
257,0.97,2416.714,2429.226,"I know everyone else has been formal, but I will take it back.",45,,
258,0.97,2429.226,2440.104,"Director McIntyre, you wrote in your response that you had such high turnover with so many different directors, just that consistency has gone by the wayside.",45,,
259,0.97,2440.104,2443.307,"And that is No-Fault to anyone, it's just the situation we are in.",45,,
260,0.97,2443.307,2447.445,And that is the most important Tenet of being a leader.,45,,
261,0.97,2447.445,2455.219,You are well poised to take us to place that Oed has not been in a long time.,45,,
262,0.97,2455.219,2460.524,I will ask you questions in the minute.,45,,
263,0.97,2460.524,2467.465,"Similarly to Oed, downtown is Well-Positioned for when we come back.",45,,
264,0.97,2467.465,2475.873,I don't think it was as bad as the news media made it out to be.,45,,
265,0.97,2475.873,2488.485,During the downtown sales Association gala they had [Indiscernible] who spoke.,45,,
266,0.97,2488.485,2500.764,"He is quoted as saying when I compare this downtown today to what I saw 25 years ago, you have already done the hard work and positions the city for success.",45,,
267,0.97,2500.764,2505.069,"We do have a tough road ahead of us, and we can do it together.",45,,
268,0.97,2505.069,2514.879,At this very moment you have a Department and a downtown and the rest of the city ready to go.,45,,
269,0.97,2514.879,2517.781,I could not think of a better person to do it then you.,45,,
270,0.97,2517.781,2522.253,I know in our conversations we talked about the farmers markets.,45,,
271,0.97,2522.253,2536.734,The smallest businesses that provide food and nutrition for Seattle . that is how Pikes place started.,45,,
272,0.97,2536.734,2557.554,"I would ask what you can help to support farmers markets and, just for the general public, our discussion in the past has been I've requested reports from Oed about how they can better support farmers markets as a Constellation because they're all separate.",45,,
273,0.97,2557.554,2563.561,When I made this request I was told I had to fund a staff position for.,45,,
274,0.97,2563.561,2575.806,"I attempted to and we had some back room--not really back room, but it was on the record, actually.",45,,
275,0.97,2575.806,2587.551,"Just to say, I will fund a special events coordinator because that is what I hear is the need, but I need this report done well.",45,,
276,0.97,2587.551,2593.457,The report was never done in the farmers markets don't have that support.,45,,
277,0.97,2593.457,2595.292,That is okay.,45,,
278,0.97,2595.292,2601.098,It is just where we are at.,45,,
279,0.97,2601.098,2603.734,"Director McIntyre, I know you have a love for farmers markets.",45,,
280,0.97,2603.734,2605.469,What can we be doing to support,45,,
281,0.97,2605.469,2611.742,You know I have a love for farmers markets.,46,,
282,0.97,2611.742,2615.98,Food is near and dear to my heart.,46,,
283,0.97,2615.98,2619.116,And food as a business is near and dear to my heart.,46,,
284,0.97,2619.116,2624.989,We have an interesting role at Oed where we handle events permits.,46,,
285,0.97,2624.989,2639.703,And now we want to take on the farmers market permits and make it as easy as possible for the smallest businesses working with bureaucracy.,46,,
286,0.97,2639.703,2640.604,It is a burden.,46,,
287,0.97,2640.604,2646.443,And we need to streamline and make it as clear as possible while we asked for whatever information that we ask for.,46,,
288,0.97,2646.443,2667.598,"So we will undergo, we have an ambition to cleanup all varieties of those activity permits, including farmers markets so they have a one-stop shop and they don't have to go to multiple departments, which I think was your ambition.",46,,
289,0.97,2667.598,2679.309,"Our special events team is working on lingering issues that have been causing problems, for instance, alcohol sales or Tastings on public land.",46,,
290,0.97,2679.309,2688.619,We are trying to build a report with them and stabilize ourselves in House so we can provide better service for them,46,,
291,0.97,2688.619,2692.022,I'm excited to work with you.,47,,
292,0.97,2692.022,2700.998,Another important sector of our economy is [Indiscernible].,47,,
293,0.97,2700.998,2706.67,"When I look at Ballard, they've always had a strong economy even when it was not desired by those outside of Ballard.",47,,
294,0.97,2706.67,2709.773,Things change and it's okay.,47,,
295,0.97,2709.773,2718.615,Now Ballard Avenue is where you were really nice jeans.,47,,
296,0.97,2718.615,2732.73,The strong economy has been there because people can have a job that pays in a family wage without going into debt for education or anything else.,47,,
297,0.97,2732.73,2744.208,"When I look at fisherman's terminal, I see the mast on every vessel being a small business.",47,,
298,0.97,2744.208,2761.959,"With that, within the ship Canal and freshwater, if a vessel, whether it is a yacht or fishing vessel, if they cannot get full service, they will choose to go to a different port.",47,,
299,0.97,2761.959,2767.731,That is the importance of each of these different businesses.,47,,
300,0.97,2767.731,2774.638,They each have such a high overhead that they cannot all be under one business.,47,,
301,0.97,2774.638,2789.887,"Understanding the Constellation of businesses creates a port that attracts different types of work, what are your thoughts and ways to support this Constellation of Maritime",47,,
302,0.97,2789.887,2806.67,"Maritime economy is important as we come out of the pandemic, there is a focus on economic resilience and requires a diversity of industry.",48,,
303,0.97,2806.67,2808.338,It is certainly part of our economic resilience plan.,48,,
304,0.97,2808.338,2823.787,"I know we've talked a lot about the turnover at Oed, but we have some incredible talent and staff working on all of these issues.",48,,
305,0.97,2823.787,2825.956,It is not as if we are floundering.,48,,
306,0.97,2825.956,2830.694,It's more of how do we have focus going forward.,48,,
307,0.97,2830.694,2850.38,I will mention the mirror timing lead and he is a rock Star and comes in highly Networked with the Maritime community understanding different perspectives and able to [Indiscernible] workforce issues and a variety of others.,48,,
308,0.97,2850.38,2867.598,"A couple things we are going to work on, focus on Land-Use and how we produce [Indiscernible] diversity of needs, second, they have an aging workforce and what are we doing to support them.",48,,
309,0.97,2867.598,2886.416,"The partnership is a way we can come in and be supportive of the Maritime future, not just the current and we want to see more opportunities like that were we can work with the colleges in a variety of players to support the Maritime",48,,
310,0.97,2886.416,2890.654,You actually answered all my follow-up questions.,49,,
311,0.97,2890.654,2901.265,This is another demonstration of your leadership.,49,,
312,0.97,2901.265,2904.601,You are Well-Placed to accomplish great things.,49,,
313,0.97,2904.601,2908.805,I'm excited to get this work done with you.,49,,
314,0.97,2908.805,2912.943,I have a question.,50,,
315,0.97,2912.943,2925.188,"In your responses, and you may have mentioned it in your presentation on June 22nd we talked about the vision for Oed, you say it needs to build out research and data capacity.",50,,
316,0.97,2925.188,2930.727,What you mean by that?,50,,
317,0.97,2930.727,2934.431,And what data do you wish you could've gotten from the city when you will working for the,50,,
318,0.97,2934.431,2937.734,You hit it on the head.,51,,
319,0.97,2937.734,2941.004,This is part of coming from an external Stakeholder to now on the inside.,51,,
320,0.97,2941.004,2955.986,I wanted to have the city produce a finger on the pulse of the economy so that external Stakeholders can have a clear sense of what is going on and where they can make an impact.,51,,
321,0.97,2955.986,2959.423,I would love for Oed to deliver that product.,51,,

388,0.97,3473.303,3481.544,This legislation adds flexibility by enabling a restaurant to opt out of the 15% calf cap.,60,,
389,0.97,3481.544,3492.856,A sensible 15% cap was adopted as the civil emergency order in 2020 and helping many local restaurants survived the pandemic.,60,,

397,0.97,3562.325,3569.532,It was good for Seattleites and remains good policy today.,62,,
398,0.97,3569.532,3582.245,This small business Legislations means that restaurants will have more control over the cost of their products and people ordering food from home will not get price gouged.,62,,

400,0.97,3585.682,3602.599,I've seen from restaurants in my community the need for this legislation that has worked during the pandemic and this is the type of legislation we want to keep in the city as we emerge from the last two years.,62,,

410,0.97,3666.496,3693.556,"Restaurants were among the hardest hit businesses during the pandemic and as we continued Transitioning out, this is protection I believe we need to keep . This in amendment would clarify in technical ways to pieces, one about delivery location and second about refusal of service.",66,,

416,0.97,3724.554,3728.491,This is the amendment.,68,,
417,0.97,3728.491,3729.292,This is the statement.,68,,
418,0.97,3729.292,3742.205,It would clarify the scope and the definitions of delivery services in a food or beverage order to include pickup or delivery to any location within Seattle city limits.,68,,
419,0.97,3742.205,3748.344,Right now it says to any location.,68,,
420,0.97,3748.344,3782.078,And it would make a drafting correction to remove redundant language prohibiting the delivery platforms from refusing service to restaurants that choose the 15% option for delivery services . I will Scroll down and you can see where these amendments would take place and the definition of delivery services and the definition of food or beverage order.,68,,
421,0.97,3782.078,3788.217,And the actual fee and charge requirements.,68,,

432,0.97,3863.659,3871.067,It would not apply to delivery orders outside of Seattle.,71,,
433,0.97,3871.067,3885.514,"This legislation covers delivery orders to any location in Seattle . If a restaurant is purchasing services through a food delivery platform for delivery outside of Seattle, this legislation would not cover that.",71,,

443,0.97,3935.398,3949.478,So--this does not change--does this apply to restaurants outside of Seattle that are delivering to customers inside Seattle?,75,,
444,0.97,3949.478,3950.479,Is that part of the geographic,75,,
445,0.97,3950.479,3969.999,My understanding is this is for restaurants in Seattle that are purchasing delivery services to any location in Seattle.,76,,
446,0.97,3969.999,3981.377,So the city of Seattle has jurisdiction over the delivery platforms offering services to restaurants in Seattle.,76,,

457,0.97,4040.803,4054.717,Amendment #2 would extend a practice that restaurants have become accustomed to.,82,,
458,0.97,4054.717,4067.196,It used to be standard contract language but it says that the platforms cannot restrict prices that food and restaurants can charge on the platform.,82,,
459,0.97,4067.196,4101.163,"This was brought to us by restaurants United, and it is very similar to language in similar policy in San Francisco where they prohibit at base delivery companies from restricting or setting restaurant prices.",82,,

477,0.97,4205.434,4210.206,It is the portion that restaurants pay to the delivery service platforms.,92,,
478,0.97,4210.206,4216.345,It does not impact the delivery service fees.,92,,
479,0.97,4216.345,4235.631,"One of the questions I had was whether or not to recoup lost revenue and with the platforms increase the delivery fee, which would be bad for customers and for restaurants if business goes down.",92,,

481,0.97,4238.1,4252.681,But I have to weigh the potential long-term consequences against the very immediate need that is being voiced by my constituents.,92,,

496,0.97,4369.198,4383.579,We were nervous about--this was tied to the civil emergency.,97,,
497,0.97,4383.579,4388.717,What was driving this was the need to put something in place before the civil emergency was over and not having a gap.,97,,
498,0.97,4388.717,4395.657,"I really appreciate--we don't know when that will happen, but I appreciate the hard work that people put into this.",97,,

517,0.97,4542.571,4545.774,I am filling in for my colleagues.,107,,
518,0.97,4545.774,4548.277,Okay.,108,,
519,0.97,4548.277,4555.25,I will leave the presentation to you.,108,,
520,0.97,4555.25,4566.128,Today we will be presenting a renewal agreement with North mountain Substation which is a Snohomish County public utility district.,109,,
521,0.97,4566.128,4578.774,North mountain Substation is 75 miles from here . The customers are served by Snohomish County public district.,109,,
522,0.97,4578.774,4587.849,The history of this agreement is that Snohomish County Pud recognized they had a growing load of customers.,109,,
523,0.97,4587.849,4596.491,The least cost way for them to serve that was to tap into a city light transmission line that existed.,109,,
524,0.97,4596.491,4621.35,The relationship was proposed that they would provide bulk service powers is [Indiscernible] the Substation bill pay for by Snohomish County Pud was signed in 1991.,109,,
525,0.97,4625.053,4655.684,The new agreement that has been restated and amended in the 20 year contract has a cost recovery mechanism different and provides more transparency to Snopud for what the costs really are . This continues [Indiscernible] for the operations and maintenance cost associated with the North mountain Substation.,109,,
526,0.97,4655.684,4669.064,"This is what we would call a housekeeping item, but it is an agreement that has served us well and it serves the communities that Snopud serves.",110,,
527,0.97,4669.064,4670.932,We are happy to answer questions you may have.,110,,
528,0.97,4670.932,4679.508,I would just like to acknowledge the hard work that Mike Watkins has done bringing this to fruition.,111,,
529,0.97,4679.508,4690.786,A lot of Back-And-Forth and we had a great relationship that is gotten better because of the work that Mike has done.,111,,
530,0.97,4690.786,4694.089,I have a couple questions.,112,,
531,0.97,4694.089,4695.357,How much of a reimbursement are,112,,
532,0.97,4695.357,4707.269,"The big cost was when the Substation was originally built monthly we are talking about $20,000.",113,,
533,0.97,4707.269,4709.304,A little more than that.,113,,
534,0.97,4709.304,4717.512,Some we do a lot of maintenance . in the future it will vary by month.,113,,
535,0.97,4717.512,4725.053,"But on average it will be between $21,000- $25,000 per month.",113,,
536,0.97,4725.053,4730.625,My other question is we have three dams along the Skagit River.,114,,
537,0.97,4730.625,4739.835,Covering a lot of distance are there other jurisdictions with whom you have similar agreements?,114,,
538,0.97,4739.835,4749.811,This is the only relationship where we maintain a Substation for another Utilityto serve their customers.,115,,
539,0.97,4749.811,4761.189,Their easements are there but no connection for the transmission lines along better.,115,,
540,0.97,4761.189,4764.059,It does seem to make sense.,116,,
541,0.97,4764.059,4764.493,Thank you.,116,,
542,0.97,4764.493,4768.396,"Colleagues, are there any questions?",116,,
543,0.97,4768.396,4772.701,My questions are not about the agreement.,117,,
544,0.97,4772.701,4776.738,This is North mountain Substation.,117,,
545,0.97,4776.738,4783.378,Are we changing the transmission?,117,,
546,0.97,4783.378,4785.213,I usually ask these in private.,117,,
547,0.97,4785.213,4797.392,"Is the voltage, is that correct, the voltage coming out of Skagit or is this Substation to provide Darrington with",117,,
548,0.97,4797.392,4806.468,This Substation provides power service to Snohomish.,118,,
549,0.97,4806.468,4829.791,What happens in Skagit is are generators step up to a voltage and that line is tapped into a small Substation and there is a step down transformer owned by Snopud.,118,,
550,0.97,4829.791,4842.971,"One of the four transmissions coming from Skagit, that is the [Indiscernible] to this North mountain Substation.",119,,
551,0.97,4842.971,4845.807,Is a great question.,120,,
552,0.97,4845.807,4848.61,The customer transforms the,120,,
553,0.97,4848.61,4857.285,So we have four lines out of Skagit and this taps into it.,121,,
554,0.97,4857.285,4864.292,I have more questions but I will save it for another day.,122,,
555,0.97,4864.292,4865.961,Thank you.,123,,
556,0.97,4865.961,4867.596,Councilmember Herbold.,123,,
557,0.97,4867.596,4876.471,I'm to preface my questions as one that I'm being a little dense.,124,,
558,0.97,4876.471,4887.315,The slide says cost recovery mechanism is direct billing to Snopud for work performed by city light.,124,,
559,0.97,4887.315,4905.8,I thought the agreement is to direct the cost--two used a cost--I thought that was the change.,124,,
560,0.97,4905.8,4908.536,It says that is what we are doing now.,124,,
561,0.97,4908.536,4912.607,The current agreement is 1991 had a look back feature.,125,,
562,0.97,4912.607,4943.772,"It looks over the past two years and looks at the cost of city light of operation and maintenance of North mountain, an three fairly complicated County mechanism has a loading cost that we've apportioned to that portion of the system, and then, Snohomish receives the same monthly bill every month.",125,,
563,0.97,4943.772,4946.441,[Indiscernible] more transparency on a monthly basis on what work was done.,125,,
564,0.97,4946.441,4958.953,Under the new amended agreement we will track work by employee and provide Snohomish a detailed invoice monthly on what work was actually accomplished.,125,,
565,0.97,4958.953,4967.329,That is the change of recovering the cost and it provides more transparency for Snohomish.,125,,
566,0.97,4967.329,4968.83,Does that help?,125,,
567,0.97,4968.83,4974.102,A little bit.,126,,
568,0.97,4974.102,4984.779,The second bullet point on that slide says cost recovery mechanism is now direct billing to Snopud performed by city light.,126,,
569,0.97,4984.779,4987.615,Cost recovery mechanism will be under the new agreement?,126,,
570,0.97,4987.615,4990.418,That is correct.,127,,
571,0.97,4990.418,5003.631,"For these kinds of agreements, I'm focused on temporal language to Orient what is changing.",128,,
572,0.97,5003.631,5007.102,Good feedback for us for the future.,129,,
573,0.97,5007.102,5021.082,It sounded to me like there was an estimate before and now there is more detailed tracking of the actual labor cost.,130,,
574,0.97,5021.082,5024.753,And more immediate for them to understand.,131,,
575,0.97,5024.753,5036.364,It puts them in a situation where they understand what will be coming rather than a Two- year look back.,131,,
576,0.97,5036.364,5038.6,Okay.,132,,
577,0.97,5038.6,5040.068,One moment.,132,,
578,0.97,5040.068,5044.739,I'm finding my script.,132,,
579,0.97,5044.739,5052.18,I move to recommend passage of Council bill 120378.,132,,
580,0.97,5052.18,5053.982,Is there a second?,132,,
581,0.97,5053.982,5055.25,Second.,133,,
582,0.97,5055.25,5059.754,It has been moved to recommend passage of the bill.,133,,
583,0.97,5059.754,5061.089,Are there further comments?,133,,

622,0.97,5389.417,5391.519,We will talk about --,148,,
623,0.97,5391.519,5398.86,Can you pull the microphone closer to you?,149,,
624,0.97,5398.86,5399.394,Is that better?,149,,
625,0.97,5399.394,5402.563,Bring it in.,150,,
626,0.97,5402.563,5410.104,We will talk about what is an integrated resource plan and why we do these plans.,151,,
627,0.97,5410.104,5418.546,The Irp process and the 2022 Irp conclusions.,151,,
628,0.97,5418.546,5423.084,"To get started, what exactly is an integrated resource plan.",151,,
629,0.97,5423.084,5432.46,It is a biannual plan to meet the electric power needs for the next 20 years.,151,,
630,0.97,5432.46,5436.998,It is an opportunity for Stakeholders and customers to share the vision for the future power supply mix.,151,,
631,0.97,5436.998,5443.137,They are updated every two years and must be approved by Seattle city council.,151,,
632,0.97,5443.137,5449.477,They are not really intended to represent specific resource actions be taken.,151,,
633,0.97,5449.477,5464.859,"In other words, it is a directional and proportional start to resource actions for city light and we will see that in the conclusion section.",151,,
634,0.97,5464.859,5469.363,Why do we create integrative resource plans?,151,,
635,0.97,5469.363,5479.841,"It is a vital feedback loop and plan between customers, Stakeholders, governing bodies, and city light.",151,,
636,0.97,5479.841,5481.909,We need to meet projected loads and clean energy policies.,151,,
637,0.97,5481.909,5490.351,It is a revised Kos a revised code of Washington state.,151,,
638,0.97,5490.351,5507.435,"It basically says that all Washington state utilities that have over 25,000 customers are required to produce and Irp.",151,,
639,0.97,5507.435,5513.374,It is a two-year process and there are a lot of moving parts.,151,,
640,0.97,5513.374,5519.514,We tried to condense it into four main categories.,151,,
641,0.97,5519.514,5525.887,These are the existing resources.,151,,
642,0.97,5525.887,5530.191,"We look at the long-term contracts, power purchase agreement contracts, and we have our own Hydro generation.",151,,
643,0.97,5530.191,5535.429,Then we look to identify the resource needs.,151,,
644,0.97,5535.429,5539.567,We start that with a loaded forecast.,151,,
645,0.97,5539.567,5561.889,"That estimates the demand for electricity, and then we need to account for variability and risk and we use this by different historical conditions for the load forecast.",151,,
646,0.97,5561.889,5569.096,In addition to identifying our needs we look at policy needs.,151,,
647,0.97,5569.096,5573.2,The point here is the identification accounts for energy and these policy needs.,151,,
648,0.97,5573.2,5578.506,"That brings us to the next step, which is resource options.",151,,
649,0.97,5578.506,5583.744,We look around the state and the region and look for resources.,151,,
650,0.97,5583.744,5603.597,"Where are they located, how much do they cost, what is their generation profile, do they have feasible transmission path--and the Demand-Side or customer side.",151,,
651,0.97,5603.597,5612.173,This is like energy conservation members or solar programs.,151,,
652,0.97,5612.173,5638.466,One thing I want to point out is the climate change scenarios . The Electrification scenario was derived from the assessment that Seattle city light produced with the electric power research Institute.,151,,
653,0.97,5638.466,5647.274,The climate change scenarios was produced with the Washington climate science team.,151,,
654,0.97,5647.274,5659.854,Those are two new scenarios and we are excited to talk about those.,151,,
655,0.97,5659.854,5672.299,We want to design and go through the best mix of resources to meet the energy and policy needs.,151,,
656,0.97,5672.299,5680.174,"I also want to note that the last 3 to 4 steps of the process, we have a feedback loop with the Irp advisory external panel.",151,,
657,0.97,5680.174,5685.846,These are the members on this external advisory panel.,151,,
658,0.97,5685.846,5687.381,It is a great group.,151,,
659,0.97,5687.381,5699.527,We had nine meetings for this cycle and we gave presentations and asked for feedback.,151,,
660,0.97,5699.527,5716.444,"We appreciate it the participation in the Irp process, and this allows others to have a say in the process and not just city light.",151,,
661,0.97,5716.444,5724.418,Thank you for walking us through the process we will start with the first category.,152,,
662,0.97,5724.418,5732.927,"As we can see here, the portfolio has a lot of Renewables.",152,,
663,0.97,5732.927,5739.967,Over 90% and a lot of that is Hydro.,152,,
664,0.97,5739.967,5758.486,These are purchases that we don't know where they are necessarily coming from or they are not necessarily greenhouse gas neutral.,152,,
665,0.97,5758.486,5765.025,The Bpa contract also has specified power.,152,,
666,0.97,5765.025,5773.434,"Here is another look at the existing resources, but on a monthly basis.",152,,
667,0.97,5773.434,5781.642,We look at the black line and we can see that we are very much a winter peaking utility.,152,,
668,0.97,5781.642,5798.025,"If we look at the summer time, specifically August, we can see on an unexpected basis we have deficits that we fill with market purchases and we see that in July it is a little bit tight.",152,,
669,0.97,5798.025,5805.032,As part of this work we look today climate change scenario that shows in the summer the deficit could have more risk.,152,,
670,0.97,5805.032,5828.122,If we look at the winter time we can see the gaps can become a little bit tight and as part of the Electrification scenario we identified a winter need could be greater and tighter.,152,,
671,0.97,5828.122,5841.569,"On this slide, are we looking at what the desire is for the green to be all the way to the black line?",153,,
672,0.97,5841.569,5845.039,So we have our own resources meeting the load?,153,,
673,0.97,5845.039,5849.076,Is that the goal?,153,,
674,0.97,5849.076,5854.448,That is part of it.,154,,
675,0.97,5854.448,5857.251,We identify resource needs.,154,,
676,0.97,5857.251,5865.859,Definitely for this Irp we look at the summer need a bit more closely.,154,,
677,0.97,5865.859,5867.127,We will discuss points about,154,,
678,0.97,5867.127,5877.705,"Because we are a Hydro utility, there will always be Seasonality to that.",155,,
679,0.97,5877.705,5889.149,We don't control the weather or the timing to when external parties that control water levels release water.,155,,
680,0.97,5889.149,5900.027,What you would expect is to have a safety cushion with the combination of Bpa.,155,,
681,0.97,5900.027,5905.933,That is what this plan does.,155,,
682,0.97,5905.933,5913.707,"It is important to remember, especially Bpa.",156,,
683,0.97,5913.707,5924.418,It is an allocation of energy we are entitled to.,156,,
684,0.97,5924.418,5934.461,"What happens is when the blue, orange, and green dip",157,,
685,0.97,5934.461,5944.271,We have access to short-term contracts and that is part of the hedging strategy.,158,,
686,0.97,5944.271,5949.343,This demonstrates the need for dispersed energy resources,159,,
687,0.97,5949.343,5964.291,"When we think about distributing energy resources, we think of them as Renewables and distributed resources are the same.",160,,
688,0.97,5964.291,5985.879,"I think when Seattle looks at opportunities to fill that gap and you will see this in the portfolio that we percent, as we look at how to do that, it is through the use of Renewables and Distributive Renewables over the future.",160,,
689,0.97,5985.879,5994.221,Different resources like demand response energy efficiency.,161,,
690,0.97,5994.221,5997.424,It adds a resiliency factor.,161,,
691,0.97,5997.424,6010.738,"In this changing environment where there are Wildfires all over the place and things that could distract the transmission of energy, it is important for us to have that factor as part of our portfolio.",161,,
692,0.97,6010.738,6023.517,"Long before I came here, Seattle made the decision to move from being a slice customer to being a block customer.",162,,
693,0.97,6023.517,6038.866,"We do have the ability to shape that . If we were a slice customer, you would see the blue peaking at the same time as the green.",162,,
694,0.97,6038.866,6042.97,That is what drove a very simplistic view.,162,,
695,0.97,6042.97,6047.074,That is what drove the decision.,162,,
696,0.97,6047.074,6049.109,"Otherwise, we have more Hydro risk.",162,,
697,0.97,6049.109,6059.153,"Under the block product that we take, we are able to use it more when water levels are lower.",162,,
698,0.97,6059.153,6067.127,Very helpful.,163,,
699,0.97,6067.127,6075.502,"Now we will talk about the second category, which are resource needs.",164,,
700,0.97,6075.502,6076.737,We have three items to discuss.,164,,
701,0.97,6076.737,6091.118,"The first is policy, which is not, that requires a percentage of the load to come from Non- Hydro renewable resources.",164,,
702,0.97,6091.118,6100.727,We also have the clean energy transformation act.,164,,
703,0.97,6100.727,6117.644,"And we have our own resource adequacy . Let's talk about our resource adequacy needs, which are part of the portfolio needs.",164,,
704,0.97,6117.644,6141.368,As you can see winter and summer needs are growing the main reason for growth is not Co-Because the pace of this could grow Electrification grows at a faster rate.,164,,
705,0.97,6141.368,6149.743,You can see that Seattle city light has relied on the market in the summer.,164,,
706,0.97,6149.743,6156.383,For this Irp we will look at how to address that gap.,164,,
707,0.97,6156.383,6178.705,"Some of the reasons for that the risk of climate change, and the higher attrition of Renewables in the market may make that energy less reliable for us.",164,,
708,0.97,6178.705,6182.209,Here we will look at the portfolio needs from clean energy policies.,164,,
709,0.97,6182.209,6185.012,This is looking at the status of different policies.,164,,
710,0.97,6185.012,6196.056,"For I-937 we have a short-term need for 2024 and 2025, and this is due to Covid-19 loads.",164,,
711,0.97,6196.056,6206.6,After that we don't expect significant needs until early 2030.,164,,
712,0.97,6206.6,6211.305,Then we have the clean energy transformation act.,164,,
713,0.97,6211.305,6220.747,We have a clean portfolio that is over 90%.,164,,
714,0.97,6220.747,6226.053,Seattle is Well-Positioned to meet this policy.,164,,
715,0.97,6226.053,6227.688,Now we will talk about the resource needs.,164,,
716,0.97,6227.688,6234.261,"Let's talk about the third category, which is how we fill those needs.",164,,
717,0.97,6234.261,6238.699,We looked at two types of options.,164,,
718,0.97,6238.699,6241.201,Supply-Side and Demand-Side.,164,,
719,0.97,6241.201,6247.574,We looked at energy efficiency and customer solar.,164,,
720,0.97,6247.574,6249.943,These are for Seattle area customers.,164,,
721,0.97,6249.943,6260.053,For Supply-Side we look at solar resources and wind resources.,164,,
722,0.97,6260.053,6272.566,One is formed Montana wind and those resources are not available until after 2032.,164,,
723,0.97,6272.566,6279.339,We are participating in conversations.,165,,
724,0.97,6279.339,6305.298,We designed the best mix of resources . We look at the resource options and we quantify how this resource options help to meet the regulatory requirements while minimizing total portfolio costs.,166,,
725,0.97,6305.298,6331.525,"As part of this process, we look at different portfolio strategies such as transmission availability and also feedback from Stakeholders and we capture Metrics and identify what might be a robust option for Seattle city light.",166,,
726,0.97,6331.525,6347.407,"The Metrics we capture across different choices are costs, greenhouse gas emissions, transmission risk, climate change, and Electrification preparedness.",166,,
727,0.97,6347.407,6356.783,We identify which portfolios have the most robust characteristics,166,,
728,0.97,6356.783,6368.862,Here is the 2022 Irp portfolio.,167,,
729,0.97,6368.862,6379.473,"You will notice a diverse array of colors and that is because there is diversity in resources, which is a good thing.",167,,
730,0.97,6379.473,6389.883,We have new wind resources in Orange and we have green as energy efficiency programs.,167,,
731,0.97,6389.883,6395.055,And this in the Graybar for energy projects.,167,,
732,0.97,6395.055,6412.405,And the yellow one is for big solar projects and the smaller ones are demand response and distributed local solar programs.,167,,
733,0.97,6412.405,6416.109,The big Takeaway is that most of these resources are planned for the next 5 to 8 years.,167,,
734,0.97,6416.109,6420.38,It is expected that they will be in place before 2030.,167,,
735,0.97,6420.38,6428.789,"Paul, wonderful.",168,,
736,0.97,6428.789,6431.525,This is great.,168,,
737,0.97,6431.525,6437.03,", me go back to the last slide.",168,,
738,0.97,6437.03,6441.301,I want to understand the average Megawatts.,168,,
739,0.97,6441.301,6458.952,"When we look at this, I know I went back and forth with you all and it is hard to visualize this information ..",168,,
740,0.97,6458.952,6476.336,We are gaining Megawatts . The green line is actually a reduction in use.,168,,
741,0.97,6476.336,6477.971,These are all resources that we require.,169,,
742,0.97,6477.971,6480.674,What that slide--am I wrong?,169,,
743,0.97,6480.674,6492.819,"What that slide should show you is at the very beginning, I think it will be a percentage type of approach.",169,,
744,0.97,6492.819,6511.304,"So if I need 100 Megawatts, I will roughly acquire 70 Megawatts of land and 20 Megawatts of efficiency, and over time you see it changing.",169,,
745,0.97,6511.304,6518.745,"Those of the incremental resources that we need from what we have today by 2026, 2030, and 2040.",169,,
746,0.97,6518.745,6524.084,"The energy efficiency, is that a reduction?",170,,
747,0.97,6524.084,6529.623,But we think of it as a generation resource.,171,,
748,0.97,6529.623,6535.562,We think of energy efficiency as a generation plan that we have purchased.,171,,
749,0.97,6535.562,6541.468,The city of Seattle has invested heavily in a plant that we call energy of the city.,171,,
750,0.97,6541.468,6545.939,Energy efficiency.,171,,
751,0.97,6545.939,6550.644,"The reduction, as described, has the net effect increasing the capacity we have available.",172,,
752,0.97,6550.644,6555.749,That is when we think of it as a resource.,172,,
753,0.97,6555.749,6558.385,And we have to acquire it,172,,
754,0.97,6558.385,6576.069,"& GT; one thing the slide is intended to show, and an important take away is that Electrification and energy efficiency work Hand- In-Hand.",173,,
755,0.97,6576.069,6592.919,"The path for the city of Seattle and communities we serve, the path to Electrification is about acquiring new resources, but a big part of that is to increase the amount of due resource we require the less use of power.",173,,
756,0.97,6592.919,6602.562,That is how we will make it work.,173,,
757,0.97,6602.562,6607.1,"It is an interesting dynamic because Electrification means we encourage customers to use more power, which is different than we've ever done.",173,,
758,0.97,6607.1,6616.509,At the same time we are encouraging them to be more efficient consumers of the product that they need and use and that is how we deliver on,173,,
759,0.97,6616.509,6620.947,That is fantastic.,174,,
760,0.97,6620.947,6624.217,This is not cumulative.,174,,
761,0.97,6624.217,6635.528,"When I look at t 40, it is not because of 2026 and 2030.",174,,
762,0.97,6635.528,6636.73,That is what we are targeting,174,,
763,0.97,6636.73,6638.965,It is cumulative.,175,,
764,0.97,6638.965,6649.175,The main point is there's not a lot of change between 2030 and 2040.,175,,
765,0.97,6649.175,6656.116,"On efficiency, we cannot just say, Okay, conserve energy.",176,,
766,0.97,6656.116,6670.363,"City light has fairly robust energy efficiency incentives that you offer your customers, and those are not limited to customers in Seattle.",176,,
767,0.97,6670.363,6675.702,You also offer those to your whole customer base.,176,,
768,0.97,6675.702,6679.606,That is absolutely true.,177,,
769,0.97,6679.606,6702.495,"The incentives that we offer change over time and they will certainly change over the period of time we are looking at because there are people out there who are very smart about moving the market, which is when you encourage changes that don't require action on the part of customers.",177,,
770,0.97,6702.495,6704.731,Think about energy efficient appliances.,177,,
771,0.97,6704.731,6712.172,Over time the incentives have dropped because all of the appliances are efficient.,177,,
772,0.97,6712.172,6714.841,That is where you move the market.,177,,
773,0.97,6714.841,6719.746,But we also provide incentives to customers to take specific actions.,177,,
774,0.97,6719.746,6727.987,And that will change over time.,177,,
775,0.97,6727.987,6730.657,Let's talk about why we need more resources.,178,,
776,0.97,6730.657,6738.832,We have long-term contracts that are gradually expiring by 2026.,178,,
777,0.97,6738.832,6747.006,We also have clean energy policies forcing coal plants retirements.,178,,
778,0.97,6747.006,6752.979,Close to 2000 Megawatts of coal plants will be retiring.,178,,
779,0.97,6752.979,6767.961,This has the potential to increase resource adequacy concerns that can result in less certainty that city light can purchase reliable energy like we talked about during the slow August times.,178,,
780,0.97,6767.961,6772.699,Another reason is the pace of climate change.,178,,
781,0.97,6772.699,6779.873,It impacts not only temperatures but the water cycle that city light uses for electricity.,178,,
782,0.97,6779.873,6790.283,And we know Electrification is happening now and it is underway not only in Seattle but in the rest of the region.,178,,
783,0.97,6790.283,6800.86,And Lastly and increased customer push for increased portfolio.,178,,
784,0.97,6800.86,6803.663,Now we can go over the conclusions.,178,,
785,0.97,6803.663,6812.338,These are conclusions as compared to the 2020 progress report.,178,,
786,0.97,6812.338,6815.008,Summer needs are a concern and has not changed.,178,,
787,0.97,6815.008,6833.593,"Winter needs are higher and that is due to a more recent load forecast, which incorporates additional Electrification from new codes and buildings and faster electric vehicle growth.",178,,
788,0.97,6833.593,6846.873,This is the first full Irp calling for new resources.,178,,
789,0.97,6846.873,6850.577,It is up to 400 Megawatts of Renewables coming Online by 2026.,178,,
790,0.97,6850.577,6858.151,"Some risk and uncertainties with the pace of Electrification, not only for city light, but for that region.",178,,
791,0.97,6858.151,6873.266,We think about the increased electricity use and the impact on transmission availability to get new projects home to Seattle city light territory.,178,,
792,0.97,6873.266,6879.405,"There is risk and uncertainty with climate change, and then intermittent resource reliance.",178,,
793,0.97,6879.405,6898.458,What I mean by that is solar and wind and how they depend on the weather to produce electricity.,178,,
794,0.97,6898.458,6900.894,"Lastly, the development of renewable energy projects.",178,,
795,0.97,6900.894,6907.467,"We have been hearing a lot about tariff investigations, supply chain components.",178,,
796,0.97,6907.467,6915.441,And that is a last risk.,178,,
797,0.97,6915.441,6928.821,"Next, and these are a few things that came up during the external panel feed loop that we go through.",178,,
798,0.97,6928.821,6932.759,The first thing they wanted to talk about was the risk of supply demand resource development.,178,,
799,0.97,6932.759,6940.266,Can we get the wind or the solar energy that we want?,178,,
800,0.97,6940.266,6956.316,"The second point is to ensure the equity outcomes are in place for the demand options, in other words, in place for those efficiency programs, demand response programs or customer solar programs.",178,,
801,0.97,6956.316,6961.821,"Third, we want to consider development of new energy Technologies.",178,,
802,0.97,6961.821,6974.467,"There are more Technologies being developed and city light should be monitoring these developing technologies, especially as Electrification loads develop.",178,,
803,0.97,6974.467,6984.377,"And Lastly, the city should transition to Electrification strategically.",178,,
804,0.97,6984.377,6998.124,This means that all city of Seattle departments should strive to be electrifying together and that the same pace to accomplish our goals.,178,,
805,0.97,6998.124,7007.734,This is the 2022 milestones.,178,,
806,0.97,7007.734,7011.637,"I will not go through every single item on this screen, but we will pick out a few years.",178,,
807,0.97,7011.637,7015.308,We can start with 2022.,178,,
808,0.97,7015.308,7022.648,We have a demand response pilot program that we are working on animal kickoff in early 2023.,178,,
809,0.97,7022.648,7046.005,"We also have a time of use rate program and earlier this year we delivered the clean energy implementation plan, and this was the first planning document that we submitted to the Washington State Department of Commerce as part of the clean energy transformation act.",178,,
810,0.97,7046.005,7048.875,Now to 2024.,178,,
811,0.97,7048.875,7054.38,We will submit an Irp progress report.,178,,
812,0.97,7054.38,7061.554,We are doing a full Irp and do an Irp progress report.,178,,
813,0.97,7061.554,7064.624,In 2026 another full analysis.,178,,
814,0.97,7064.624,7071.998,There will be other full sets of analyses and documents released then.,178,,
815,0.97,7071.998,7093.319,We will have a full conservation assessment . We have the full strategic plan to kickoff and we will do another clean energy implementation plan.,178,,
816,0.97,7093.319,7102.762,Feel free to reach out to us.,178,,
817,0.97,7102.762,7107.867,I think now would be a good time to open it up for any questions.,178,,
818,0.97,7107.867,7113.372,I think I will wait until after the public hearing.,179,,
819,0.97,7113.372,7115.475,And we are not voting on this today.,179,,
820,0.97,7115.475,7119.145,The vote will be next week.,179,,
821,0.97,7119.145,7127.487,Can you please put the last slide up again.,180,,
822,0.97,7127.487,7135.027,"The last slide, is that the table that explains --",181,,
823,0.97,7135.027,7139.298,I want to make sure that we touched on that.,182,,
824,0.97,7139.298,7152.044,"You can see the proportionality of the resource acquisitions in the other chart we saw, this one is perhaps, depending on how you like to look at things, this is easier.",182,,
825,0.97,7152.044,7160.686,You could sum up those at the bottom and you could look proportionately.,182,,
826,0.97,7160.686,7164.557,This is what we are looking at for each of these resources.,182,,
827,0.97,7164.557,7181.841,"Over this period that includes up to 400 additional Megawatts in power, you could assume that the goal would be to acquire those resources in the proportion that you see roughly above.",182,,
828,0.97,7181.841,7208.334,"To add some context to this, part of what goes on is we are actively monitoring and conversations with resource providers to make sure that we are prepared to acquire the resources that we need to meet these proportions as described on the chart.",183,,
829,0.97,7208.334,7218.211,"If you think about the 400, that is the main thing I want you to connect back.",184,,
830,0.97,7218.211,7223.449,"Customer solar, demand response, we are just getting our feet wet in those areas.",184,,
831,0.97,7223.449,7231.624,Those results in shifting the load or shifting from one time to another.,184,,
832,0.97,7231.624,7243.235,And then energy efficiency is a reduction that reduces the need to acquire resources.,184,,
833,0.97,7243.235,7250.843,"When we look at acquiring the 400 Megawatts, the ratio is approximately what you see.",184,,
834,0.97,7250.843,7265.958,"As these other resources become more mature and we can lean into them, the numbers will increase.",184,,
835,0.97,7265.958,7282.241,"If there are no other immediate questions, I will move into the public hearing.",185,,
836,0.97,7282.241,7313.506,As presiding officer I'm opening the public hearing on this resolution relating to the city light Department acknowledging and approving the integrated resource plan as conforming with the public policy objectives and approving the integrated resource plan for the biennium through August 2024.,185,,
837,0.97,7313.506,7315.574,The Online registration form has been up for a while.,185,,
838,0.97,7315.574,7317.143,"To my knowledge, no one has signed up.",185,,
839,0.97,7317.143,7318.577,There,186,,
840,0.97,7318.577,7329.021,We only have one person signed up for the public hearing.,187,,
841,0.97,7329.021,7343.035,I will open it up to Alex Zimmerman.,187,,
842,0.97,7346.706,7357.149,My name is Alex Zimmerman.,188,,
843,0.97,7362.822,7376.936,"I see this plan made by city light, we pay $400,000 per year.",188,,
844,0.97,7376.936,7394.086,"Last year I see a similar plan made by the same manager who we pay $400,000 a year and approved by nine clown.",188,,
845,0.97,7394.086,7409.402,"The year before I see similar plan made by manager we pay $400,000 a year approved nine clown who we pay hundred $50,000 year.",188,,
846,0.97,7409.402,7420.646,"Before I see similar plan [Indiscernible] and approved by Council who make hundred and $50,000.",188,,
847,0.97,7420.646,7426.952,"My question now is why lights go bad for 750,000 people.",188,,
848,0.97,7426.952,7436.195,Can someone explain to me.,188,,
849,0.97,7436.195,7466.992,What is going on make life miserable [Indiscernible] make life better.,188,,
850,0.97,7468.127,7471.33,We become accustomed to Mr.,189,,
851,0.97,7471.33,7479.305,Zimmerman's public comments usually starting addressing us as Fascists.,189,,
852,0.97,7479.305,7493.052,I want to let the audience know that we do say that that kind of language is not allowed and we try to stress civility in chambers.,189,,
853,0.97,7493.052,7496.121,We also have restrictions on how we can restrict free speech.,189,,
854,0.97,7496.121,7503.362,I do have a couple of questions.,189,,
855,0.97,7503.362,7514.24,"When we talk about our portfolio, wind and solar are the only sources of Non-Hydro Renewables in here.",189,,
856,0.97,7514.24,7521.413,I want to make sure in the future were not precluded from incorporating other sources.,189,,
857,0.97,7521.413,7535.494,"I'm always plugging Bioenergy, which is Biosolids like spent grain.",189,,
858,0.97,7535.494,7551.043,And it is made into methane and converted into electricity and could eventually be significant enough to add to the grid.,189,,
859,0.97,7554.813,7569.061,Do you ever think about [Indiscernible],189,,
860,0.97,7569.061,7580.673,We monitor emerging technology like offshore wind.,190,,
861,0.97,7584.109,7586.445,Another sources all that,191,,
862,0.97,7586.445,7604.596,We were working on wave energy and there is a lot of activity happening around wind in Oregon.,192,,
863,0.97,7610.369,7614.606,They also present opportunities,192,,
864,0.97,7614.606,7637.863,A couple things that are worth noting is we do have some experience with the Columbia ridge project that is part of the portfolio and we also have a contract with the King County on their sewage plant as well for energy there.,193,,
865,0.97,7637.863,7642.968,We do have some experience with that and integrating it into the portfolio.,193,,
866,0.97,7642.968,7645.237,We don't preclude those Technologies.,193,,
867,0.97,7645.237,7655.114,"Things like hybrid, intermittent wind storage, those are things that could be part of the future.",193,,
868,0.97,7655.114,7661.053,All of those are in play for us.,193,,
869,0.97,7661.053,7680.205,My other question is you made a point of emphasizing the fact that this plan integrates are growing Electrification needs and climate change and the impact of climate change to perhaps--in ways we cannot account for you.,194,,
870,0.97,7680.205,7690.449,"Was that not included in the authorizing legislation, but the mandating resource plans and",194,,
871,0.97,7690.449,7701.093,"This is a good opportunity for me to acknowledge this team, which has weathered through a lot of different things.",195,,
872,0.97,7701.093,7705.931,Mr. strong stepped in in a leadership role.,195,,
873,0.97,7705.931,7710.736,We have those in the audience who have stepped in to pull this together.,195,,
874,0.97,7710.736,7724.183,These Rockstars to my left have done remarkable work and received incredible feedback from the advisory panel . You saw some of their credentials.,195,,
875,0.97,7724.183,7736.729,And how forward thinking the work they have done on the climate change portfolio is in the Electrification portfolio that we put together.,195,,
876,0.97,7736.729,7746.772,I think it is worth acknowledging how much this is sector leading work.,195,,
877,0.97,7746.772,7749.241,Thank you for emphasizing that.,196,,
878,0.97,7749.241,7758.317,"City light does stand apart, and this is a publicly owned utility.",196,,
879,0.97,7758.317,7772.998,"The notion of the framework and proportionality of the resources that we would require overtime, it was an indication of its greater agility and flexibility.",197,,
880,0.97,7772.998,7782.875,We don't know how climate change will Rollout.,197,,
881,0.97,7782.875,7791.083,"Rather than calling for specific research acquisitions, the proportionality is important in an uncertain future.",197,,
882,0.97,7791.083,7796.488,"Do you have anything to add, Brian?",198,,
883,0.97,7796.488,7799.491,I don't have any comments at this time.,199,,

888,0.97,7821.246,7824.416,Could you walk us through the deadline?,200,,
889,0.97,7824.416,7830.122,I can take that.,201,,
890,0.97,7830.122,7843.202,"The statutory requirement we have for the state of Washington requires that we have an approved Irp by the governing body, which is city council by the beginning of 2023.",201,,
891,0.97,7843.202,7850.776,"What they require is we submit that plan in advance, four months in advance.",201,,
892,0.97,7850.776,7853.645,That puts us to September 1ST.,201,,
893,0.97,7853.645,7863.121,What is intended is we have this approved plan that we submit to the Department of Commerce by September 1ST.,201,,
