55,0.97,273.906,284.45,It is time for every worker in the city to get a fair shake and a minimum pay so we can thrive just stead of just barely survive.,17,,
56,0.97,284.45,291.591,I started doing gig work because I have a physical condition where I can only work for a few hours at time because I need break up my work hours over the day.,17,,
57,0.97,291.591,298.331,Apps are the best way for know make a decent income without the rigid schedule of 9:00 to 5:00 work.,17,,
58,0.97,298.331,300.133,I want to run my own business.,17,,
59,0.97,300.133,301.467,Gig work allows know do that.,17,,
60,0.97,301.467,316.983,"In the nine years I've worked in this gig economy I have seen that flexibility undermine, the pay gets lower every single year while the expenses get higher.",17,,
61,0.97,316.983,327.46,The result for me was a car that had been hit Hi to get rid of and get a new car immediately and all I could get was this Buick that did 18 mile as gallon.,17,,
62,0.97,327.46,333.032,I went from a focus doing 30 something to a Buick doing 18.,17,,
63,0.97,333.032,338.738,My expenses skyrocketed and at the same time they were lowering the pay.,17,,
64,0.97,338.738,342.208,Kind of between a rock and hard spot there.,17,,
65,0.97,342.208,347.38,I couldn't afford the rent.,17,,
66,0.97,347.38,352.118,"We had pay up policies in place, I wouldn't be homeless had to day.",17,,
67,0.97,352.118,353.72,We want the Flexibilities before contractors.,17,,
68,0.97,353.72,362.428,In order for that to be real we need pay that accounts for our over head costs.,17,,
69,0.97,362.428,362.929,Thank you.,18,,
70,0.97,362.929,370.737,Our next Speaker is Howard Gail followed by Carmen Figueroa.,18,,

73,0.97,371.537,372.171,Howard Gail district 7.,19,,
74,0.97,372.171,403.536,Our ninth year of police reform has given us such as when the OPA extends resources on service to approve the message--[Indiscernible] we have also seen the infuriating--[Indiscernible] at the same time she justifies police behavior that has quashed those rights for thousands of Seattle identities.,19,,
75,0.97,403.536,418.217,Then there is the morally director who refuses to investigate the SPD murder last year until he is embarrassed into initiating an investigation three months after the fact and now 14 months later has still not released his findings in the hope we will forget.,19,,
76,0.97,418.217,422.822,Then is the failure of the CPC to hold public forum for over six years.,19,,
77,0.97,422.822,433.432,"When they do in February and the community unanimously tells them they do not want police investigating police, the CPC promptly votes to do the exact opposite.",19,,
78,0.97,433.432,441.607,"After eight years of failed accountability it is time to do what Newark, Nashville, Portland, Oakland and so many other U.S. cities are doing.",19,,
79,0.97,441.607,448.948,"Develop police accountability system with actual community control over police policy, police misconduct, investigations and police discipline.",19,,
80,0.97,448.948,458.157,"Instead of having a Council debate when, where and with what weapons, we need take back control of public safety.",19,,
81,0.97,458.157,465.798,Please visit Seattlestop.Org to find out how we can have a initiative to regain --,19,,
82,0.97,465.798,467.233,"Thank you, Howard.",20,,
83,0.97,467.233,475.942,Our next Speaker is Carmen Figueroa followed by Peter.,20,,

85,0.97,476.175,480.88,Hello.,21,,
86,0.97,480.88,481.047,Hi.,21,,
87,0.97,481.047,495.194,My name is Carmen Figueroa and I would like to thank you today for allowing me to explain.,21,,
88,0.97,495.194,502.668,Large companies often tout the Merricks of trickle down economics.,21,,
89,0.97,502.668,513.479,"If workers work hard at making the company successful, the company will trickle down excess Proffer its back down to the worker in the form of pay RAISES and benefits.",21,,
90,0.97,513.479,514.714,This is simply not true.,21,,
91,0.97,514.714,521.287,They have made millions off my labor and have no intention of investing in me or any of their workers.,21,,
92,0.97,521.287,526.692,They are actively lobbying for the ability to force workers to work more with less pay.,21,,
93,0.97,526.692,539.338,I would like us to switch to the philosophy of dignity of work where all work is respected equally ask all workers are paid a fair can and decent wage.,21,,
94,0.97,539.338,548.414,The pay up pay standards policy takes the first few steps to recognize and respect worker's humanity by demanding workers be paid a living wage.,21,,
95,0.97,548.414,557.123,Lawmakers need pass the pay up pay standards policy for gig workers in 2021 because we are not disposable and we should not be exploited.,21,,
96,0.97,557.123,560.259,Thank you for your time and support.,21,,
97,0.97,560.259,561.861,"Thank you, Carmen.",22,,

99,0.97,569.669,569.869,Peter.,22,,
100,0.97,569.869,572.772,Hello.,23,,
101,0.97,572.772,573.339,My name is Peter.,23,,
102,0.97,573.339,579.412,I am an abolitionist living in district 6.,23,,
103,0.97,579.412,591.357,I am calling you remove all restrictions on the right of action and to stipulate all settlements come out of SPD's budget.,23,,
104,0.97,591.357,598.864,It must be accompanied with real financial consequences if SPD violates it.,23,,
105,0.97,598.864,601.367,It excludes everyone unable to prove three things.,23,,
106,0.97,601.367,611.777,"2001 person's injuries occurred in the gathering, two, that SPD falsely designated the gathering as a violent public disturbance and three that the person was not committing a criminal offense.",23,,
107,0.97,611.777,627.226,Even with the two proposed amendments t right of action is still subject to SPD's explanation of why they used the weapons.,23,,
108,0.97,627.36,640.139,[Indiscernible] it also means that the child SPD pepper sprayed would be excluded.,23,,
109,0.97,640.139,646.746,A bar of action that bars people based on how SPD writes up their reports after the fact is unjust.,23,,
110,0.97,646.746,659.158,Please amend the right of action to remove all restrictions and stipulate that payments come directly out of SPD's budget.,23,,
111,0.97,659.158,664.296,Black lives matter.,23,,
112,0.97,664.296,664.597,Defund SPD.,23,,

115,0.97,674.774,677.009,Good morning council member.,25,,
116,0.97,677.009,678.477,My name is Jeany.,25,,
117,0.97,678.477,683.816,I'm the executive director of Seattle restaurants United.,25,,
118,0.97,683.816,696.562,"We believe that when the most marginalized in our communities are true Troouly cared for it is good for our businesses, our customers and for our city.",25,,
119,0.97,696.562,704.203,We are here because we support the principle that every worker should be paid enough enough to pay their bills and nourish their family.,25,,
120,0.97,704.203,704.837,Especially hospitality workers.,25,,
121,0.97,704.837,710.009,This is true whether they work for a small restaurant a big chain or a delivery driver for an App.,25,,
122,0.97,710.009,714.18,Delivery Apps have been an important part of keeping the restaurant industry alive over the past year.,25,,
123,0.97,714.18,719.218,That is largely due to the legislation created by this Council.,25,,
124,0.97,719.218,731.897,Because of that cap restaurant owners were able to afford these services which historically have been up to an astronomical 35%.,25,,
125,0.97,731.897,734.734,The Ceo was paid $400 million.,25,,
126,0.97,734.734,740.706,Yet front line drivers do not see a financial return that reflected their increased workload and risk.,25,,
127,0.97,740.706,751.383,A recent sur face found half workers reported they have less than $100 in their bank account at some point during the past year.,25,,
128,0.97,751.383,759.291,"This work force made up of immigrants, people of color and single parents have helped restaurants survive they just want have brought food to the community.",25,,
129,0.97,759.291,767.166,They are hard working people who are doing delivery for delivery Apps.,25,,
130,0.97,767.166,768.334,Thank you.,26,,
131,0.97,768.334,775.508,Our next Speaker is BJ last followed by.,26,,
132,0.97,775.508,778.277,Bj.,26,,
133,0.97,778.277,778.544,Hello.,27,,
134,0.97,778.544,779.111,My name is BJ.,27,,
135,0.97,779.111,788.02,I'm calling to ask Council to to remove all actions on the right of action.,27,,
136,0.97,788.02,795.361,Right of action is a bill the account ability mechanism so it must be accompanied with real financial consequences when SPD violates it.,27,,
137,0.97,795.361,801.3,The right of action should be available to everyone injured by SPD.,27,,
138,0.97,801.3,811.811,As currently written the right of action excludes everyone unable to prove in person injuries occurred in a gathering.,27,,
139,0.97,811.811,816.882,Then SPD falsely designated the gathering as a public--violent public disturbance.,27,,
140,0.97,816.882,824.557,This would exclude everyone injured in the incident unless they could prove there weren't 12 people anywhere in a crowd of thousands threatening violence.,27,,
141,0.97,824.557,834.133,Proposed amendment 1 to a lesser extent amendment 2 and as many of these issues restrict the right of action to injuries caused by uses of less lethal Wapons that violate the bill.,27,,
142,0.97,834.133,847.813,So people would still need to prove that SPD's use of--Spayed tear gas--they would have to disprove the explanation of why they used those weapons.,27,,
143,0.97,847.813,853.752,This would exclude everyone injured in the protests.,27,,
144,0.97,853.752,861.093,Proposed amendment number 2 would also exclude anyone who could not prove that they were not committing a criminal offense.,27,,
145,0.97,861.093,864.697,Which would exclude all protesters arrested last year who have not been charged.,27,,
146,0.97,864.697,871.87,Right of action that bars people based on how SPD writes up its reports after the fact is unjust.,27,,
147,0.97,871.87,879.178,Thank you.,28,,
148,0.97,879.178,888.587,Next Speaker is followed by Debora.,28,,
149,0.97,888.587,897.196,Good morning I'm an Uber and Lyft driver.,29,,
150,0.97,897.196,898.197,I do delivery sometimes.,29,,
151,0.97,898.197,903.002,The pay on the delivery side is really poor.,29,,
152,0.97,903.002,907.773,We have seen a positive change on driving site.,29,,
153,0.97,907.773,927.126,We hope to get similar productivity change on the delivery sides so that drivers can get able to fully care of their families and I stand in solidarity with Washington--working Washington.,29,,
154,0.97,927.126,929.228,Thank you for your time.,29,,
155,0.97,929.228,929.595,Thank you.,29,,
156,0.97,929.595,930.229,Thank you.,30,,

171,0.97,975.174,983.649,Here as a member of the Seattle transit writers Union I'm here to speak in favor of the additional protections for gig delivery workers proposed by pay up Seattle.,33,,
172,0.97,983.649,996.061,I want to thank Council member Herbold for her leadership on this issue and encourage the full Council to extend the same protections to gig delivery workers that ride share App workers enjoy thanks to your efforts.,33,,
173,0.97,996.061,1000.799,I used to work as lift driver prior to the Council extending these protections.,33,,
174,0.97,1000.799,1008.34,I have some idea what my brothers and sisters at gig delivery companies have Eperiencing.,33,,
175,0.97,1008.34,1013.879,I remember days where the fair I collected didn't cover the gas I used.,33,,
176,0.97,1013.879,1015.114,I would work 80 plus hour weeks.,33,,
177,0.97,1015.114,1023.055,I know there are thousands of others in the city struggling with this same need to live on less than minimum wage.,33,,
178,0.97,1023.055,1030.729,The record proof and it growth of these delivery companies comes at the expense of providing their drivers with decent wages and benefits.,33,,
179,0.97,1030.729,1041.407,"It is shameful that Doordash, a company that has enjoyed explosive dash ranks among the 50 companies with the most workers in Washington receiving food stamps.",33,,
180,0.97,1041.407,1044.51,Gig delivery workers deserve the same protection you sought to extend to ride share workers.,33,,

210,0.97,1162.327,1170.502,I'm speaking in support of the resolution to Decriminalize the medicines.,37,,
211,0.97,1170.502,1176.475,I'm very aware there is a great need for new treatments for many psychological diagnosis.,37,,
212,0.97,1176.475,1186.285,Many clients suffer from these dying these--diagnosis for years or decades.,37,,
213,0.97,1186.285,1215.314,Research says Psychedelic medicines can be used safely and are high Fenthive for--effective for some of the hardest to treat--[Indiscernible] many clients in these studies have previously tried traditional talk therapies without success.,37,,
214,0.97,1215.314,1223.355,They showed benefit from Psychedelic medicines.,37,,
215,0.97,1223.355,1231.263,It does not make sense to out law medicines that have such a strong research support.,37,,
216,0.97,1231.263,1231.597,Thank you.,37,,
217,0.97,1231.597,1233.231,"Thank you, Tony.",38,,

223,0.97,1266.064,1266.298,Okay.,39,,
224,0.97,1266.298,1267.399,Good morning Council.,39,,
225,0.97,1267.399,1268.634,My name is Ryan Burt.,39,,
226,0.97,1268.634,1269.368,I live in district 4.,39,,
227,0.97,1269.368,1272.237,I'm here to speak about the pay up policy.,39,,
228,0.97,1272.237,1276.775,A little bit about my experience and why this policy should go forward.,39,,
229,0.97,1276.775,1284.783,I have worked in the service industry and hospitality industry in Seattle for about six years now.,39,,
230,0.97,1284.783,1288.654,During the pandemic I was serving a at restaurant and then I was unemployed.,39,,
231,0.97,1288.654,1295.327,I resorted to gig work to try to make up income and--it wasn't enough.,39,,
232,0.97,1295.327,1298.497,I wasn't able to make enough money.,39,,
233,0.97,1298.497,1315.247,I went from an industry as a server where--traditionally people have this idea about how most of my wage was made up by tips and people have this idea that a server will make 20% if they do a good job or 18% or 20 to 18%.,39,,
234,0.97,1315.247,1317.883,People don't have that idea when it comes to gig workers.,39,,
235,0.97,1317.883,1325.791,"If you are delivering food to somebody, you have an option to tip but most people didn't.",39,,
236,0.97,1325.791,1335.133,There is no--cultural Impedist to be like I should tip this person for a good job.,39,,
237,0.97,1335.133,1337.102,People don't feel bad.,39,,
238,0.97,1337.102,1338.37,They don't tip.,39,,
239,0.97,1338.37,1344.743,I am back to serving now thanks to Covid restrictions being lifted and--people are very generous right now.,39,,
240,0.97,1344.743,1362.828,I don't think people have that idea when it comes to gig workers that they need to help people and so--I am urging the Council to push this policy forward so people can be supported so people can make the wage they need to make to be able to --,39,,
241,0.97,1362.828,1363.495,"Thank you, Ryan.",40,,
242,0.97,1363.495,1367.365,I noticed that Paul who we called earlier is now present.,40,,
243,0.97,1367.365,1375.741,We will go back up to Paul and then go to page.,40,,
244,0.97,1375.741,1377.909,Paul.,40,,
245,0.97,1377.909,1385.283,"Paul, if you can hit Star 6, please so you can be Unmuted.",40,,
246,0.97,1385.283,1393.024,Paul we are still seeing you muted.,40,,
247,0.97,1393.024,1393.759,There you go.,40,,
248,0.97,1393.759,1394.226,Thank you.,40,,
249,0.97,1394.226,1395.694,All right.,41,,
250,0.97,1395.694,1397.729,Thank you very much.,41,,
251,0.97,1397.729,1398.764,"So, my name is Paul.",41,,
252,0.97,1398.764,1403.668,I'm calling in with the pay up campaign for gig workers rights.,41,,
253,0.97,1403.668,1421.119,Last year I called in with a number of my friends to secure sick pay and the Seattle premium pay and I really thank the city council for taking the bold action for signing that.,41,,
254,0.97,1421.119,1421.62,It wasn't enough.,41,,
255,0.97,1421.62,1453.718,"I mean for about two weeks I saw that my pay was ballooning above of weeks Uber started slashing back at our mileage, slashing back at the pay per job for our hours and it used to be that I would be able to go into my App and see forgiven jobs that I worked say 20 minutes delivering that job and I got certain rate for that hourly time.",41,,
256,0.97,1453.718,1456.621,I would also get to see how much I got for mileage.,41,,
257,0.97,1456.621,1459.224,None of those are visible anymore.,41,,
258,0.97,1459.224,1470.001,What I do know is that on any given job Uber takes home between 30 and 40% of what is being paid.,41,,
259,0.97,1470.001,1479.945,"In that meantime while I'm making usually around $10 an hour before tips, Uber is taking home 30 to 40% of that pay.",41,,
260,0.97,1479.945,1491.69,I would like to see city council move to establish a uniformed pay floor and establish that transparency --,41,,
261,0.97,1491.69,1494.559,"Thank you, Paul.",42,,
262,0.97,1494.559,1503.468,Our next Speaker is page followed by Sage Wilson.,42,,
263,0.97,1503.468,1503.668,Page.,42,,
264,0.97,1503.668,1503.935,Hello.,43,,
265,0.97,1503.935,1505.27,My name is page.,43,,
266,0.97,1505.27,1508.24,I work at an Amazon fulfillment center.,43,,
267,0.97,1508.24,1535.0,I came here from Atlanta last year to live a better life and I do but--I worked as a delivery driver before and--the place I worked at nobody doctor there with no safety rules in place for drivers and I was told watch your back when you go into--there is no limit now with Doordash and Uber and the other monopolies.,43,,
268,0.97,1535.0,1541.439,There is no limit on how late drivers can work if the restaurant is open 24 hours you drive 24 hours.,43,,
269,0.97,1541.439,1549.481,"When you go into an apartment complex, they are never numbered in a standard way of the you often can't find where you are going.",43,,
270,0.97,1549.481,1567.499,"In addition to things other people have said from a safety standpoint, these powerful companies need do better for the people that are--potentially putting themselves in danger to deliver food.",43,,
271,0.97,1567.499,1579.978,Of course Amazon has been notorious for using and under paying gig labor and companies like Amazon need to be held accountable.,43,,
272,0.97,1579.978,1587.352,I am representing pay up and pay up is not asking for anything extraordinary.,43,,
273,0.97,1587.352,1587.619,Thank you.,43,,
274,0.97,1587.619,1588.486,Thank you.,44,,

277,0.97,1597.195,1597.395,Hi.,45,,
278,0.97,1597.395,1602.0,I'm Sage Wilson with the working Washington here to comment in support of the pay up policies.,45,,
279,0.97,1602.0,1617.983,"I wanted to under score that what we are talking about today is tens of thousands of people working here in Seattle delivering food, walking dogs, stocking shelves, washing dishes who do not benefit from our basic labor standards.",45,,
280,0.97,1617.983,1621.186,They are being paid far below minimum wage.,45,,
281,0.97,1621.186,1631.596,"It is no coincidence that these gig workers excluded from Seattle's basic protections are likely to be immigrants, workers of color, Lgbtq workers.",45,,
282,0.97,1631.596,1642.707,"Right now what we have allowed is the system to arise in Seattle where if you deliver food for a restaurant, you could be protected at minimum wage.",45,,
283,0.97,1642.707,1649.614,The same work for $1.45 an hour with the same expenses.,45,,
284,0.97,1649.614,1654.519,We know what direction this will go in if we don't act.,45,,
285,0.97,1654.519,1658.823,We need reset these incentives by making the gig economy pay up.,45,,
286,0.97,1658.823,1669.1,"Raise, protect--[Indiscernible]",45,,
287,0.97,1669.234,1671.603,"Thank you, Sage.",46,,

290,0.97,1679.177,1683.782,Hello.,47,,
291,0.97,1683.782,1688.353,My name is Dez from the hill top district.,47,,
292,0.97,1688.353,1704.002,"My pronouns are he, they and I am a Nonbinary--Ú [Indiscernible] this world can often be hostile towards people part of the Lgbtqia to hear it community.",47,,
293,0.97,1704.002,1724.055,"There is a high number of people within the community with Ptsd, anxiety and other mental health issues caused by bullying and rejection from family, peers and relatives.",47,,
294,0.97,1724.055,1731.229,It helped cement myself esteem in a world that often makes me feel anxious by being out proud.,47,,
295,0.97,1731.362,1742.44,[Indiscernible] it is Engrained often in a world that the gender Binary male and female are the default.,47,,
296,0.97,1742.44,1743.775,Our world is more complex than.,47,,
297,0.97,1743.775,1752.35,Gender I dent and I expression is as much as variance in the human experience of height and hair color.,47,,
298,0.97,1752.35,1776.341,With the Decriminal Aigs of Psychedelic safe spaces in which clear people can take Psychedelics in opening doors to once hostile medical institutions could help de--[Indiscernible] I have no doubt we could help shape the future this which Psychedelics help us explore--[Indiscernible],47,,
299,0.97,1776.474,1777.675,Thank you.,48,,
300,0.97,1777.675,1787.185,Our next Speaker is Valerie followed by Jared.,48,,
301,0.97,1787.185,1787.418,Valerie.,48,,
302,0.97,1787.418,1789.154,"Good morning, Valerie, District 2.",49,,
303,0.97,1789.154,1803.968,An article in the South Seattle Emerald on June 30th ran under the headline Oig memo reveals an investigation that cannot be remedied.,49,,
304,0.97,1803.968,1811.109,That corrupted investigation was of a violent police response to protests in September 2020.,49,,
305,0.97,1811.109,1814.579,The reporting from the Emerald is significant.,49,,
306,0.97,1814.579,1818.783,Its proof of what city residents have seen for a long time.,49,,
307,0.97,1818.783,1823.288,The OPA is not reliable body for police accountability.,49,,
308,0.97,1823.288,1840.972,Last week OPA concluded that some of the SPD officers who attend the insurrection were protected by their rights of free speech.,49,,
309,0.97,1841.105,1855.453,"[Indiscernible] we are in a vicious circle where we discuss harmful police actions when they happen, do nothing substantive about them and then turn away and let the cycle repeat.",49,,
310,0.97,1855.453,1868.166,"Let's replace the OPA with 100% civilian accountability, with real power including to discipline officers.",49,,
311,0.97,1868.166,1870.168,For more information see Seattlestop.Org.,49,,
312,0.97,1870.168,1871.336,"Thank you, Valerie.",50,,

315,0.97,1879.744,1886.985,Good morning city council members.,51,,
316,0.97,1886.985,1888.419,Thank you for having me.,51,,
317,0.97,1888.419,1889.354,My name is Jared Porter.,51,,
318,0.97,1889.354,1895.793,I'm a senior citizen and a part-time driver with Uber and also food delivery.,51,,
319,0.97,1895.793,1911.242,I am also a member of the drive forward organization and many of the members feel like our agenda is often not contemplated seriously by the city council.,51,,
320,0.97,1911.242,1926.424,Our management or our leaders take lot of time to put forward things like a very good driver's bill of rights and a moderate proposals in general.,51,,
321,0.97,1926.424,1959.357,I question the city to not take too too drastic actions that would adversely affect the gig economy companies because already Seattle is probably the highest cost in the city of the nation for them to operate under and--we take for granted they will always be here but if things get too tough they might leave and that would lessen competition and is drive up prices.,51,,
322,0.97,1959.357,1963.328,Thank Nouk you for taking my call.,51,,
323,0.97,1963.328,1965.763,Thank you.,52,,
324,0.97,1965.763,1965.997,Tatiana.,52,,

326,0.97,1967.665,1973.071,Can you hear me?,53,,

328,0.97,1973.304,1973.571,Great.,55,,
329,0.97,1973.571,1977.342,I have a question to ask.,55,,
330,0.97,1977.342,1978.543,A few questions.,55,,
331,0.97,1978.543,1992.69,"What if we took public health and evidence based harm reduction approach to drug policy that is centered on helping our most marginalized, Traumatizes and oppressed members of society instead of mesh--what if our policies were Proactive?",55,,
332,0.97,1992.69,2018.616,"What if we focus on addressing the often unmet needs of housing, inadequate income and--[Indiscernible] our Cyst Sxems policies are Excruciatingly slow to change.",55,,
333,0.97,2018.616,2027.225,I believe Decriminalizing Psychedelics in the way outlined in our ordinance is a crucial alternative that will help many fall BS on their healing journeys sooner than later.,55,,
334,0.97,2027.225,2039.67,"The experience has a wide variety of benefits including but not limited to helping people heal, depression, Ptsd, anxiety, substance use disorder and more.",55,,
335,0.97,2039.67,2052.617,Our proposed ordinance focuses on equitable access as a key corner phone and therapeutic uses via personal and group Haling as an alternative path to support the health and wellness of all residents in our community.,55,,
336,0.97,2052.617,2063.561,We are aiming to have this legislation passed this year.,55,,
337,0.97,2063.561,2065.396,"Thank you, Tatiana.",56,,
338,0.97,2065.396,2071.669,Our next Speaker is Cody followed by Miriam.,56,,

342,0.97,2083.347,2107.338,There is no reason the city of Seattle shouldn't have these medicines listed--[Indiscernible] the recent Inkrugs on the agenda of the Overdose emergency is a welcomed step on behalf of the Council.,57,,
343,0.97,2107.338,2108.172,It offers promising treatment.,57,,
344,0.97,2108.172,2115.279,We appreciate Council members for the willingness to put this issue on the referral calendar before a vote before a budget deliberation.,57,,
345,0.97,2115.279,2119.016,Our organization also expresses solidarity with the gig workers.,57,,
346,0.97,2119.016,2122.019,Thank you again for taking the time to consider the issue.,57,,

356,0.97,2142.306,2148.079,I would like to first address the city's absolute lack of preparedness for our recent heat wave.,59,,
357,0.97,2148.079,2165.763,"While you provided a single shuttle driver to accommodate thousands of residents both housed and Unhoused and a last minute and Unadvertised shelters, we were able to coordinate a complete shuttle system to get at risk people access to resources.",59,,
358,0.97,2165.763,2170.234,You couldn't even be bothered to turn on the water fountains.,59,,
359,0.97,2170.234,2181.879,"While I'm Prude of our community for once again proving we are the ones who take care of each other, I'm disgusted you can even call that an attempt to look out for your constituents.",59,,
360,0.97,2181.879,2188.152,We lost over a hundred lives with countless more--[Indiscernible] what are you going to do?,59,,
361,0.97,2188.152,2191.389,You better have a plan in place sooner than you did for this heat wave.,59,,
362,0.97,2191.389,2195.893,Next we know all of the officer were in D.C. on January 6th.,59,,
363,0.97,2195.893,2204.969,Even the couple who decided to quite literally storm the Capitol for their honeymoon.,59,,
364,0.97,2204.969,2207.004,We knew these names for week.,59,,
365,0.97,2207.004,2208.773,Do do something about it.,59,,
366,0.97,2208.773,2211.943,The OPA needs to be civilian led and focused.,59,,
367,0.97,2211.943,2214.145,Police cannot and will not police themselves.,59,,
368,0.97,2214.145,2221.352,"Next, the right of action that is barring people from taking legal action when their rights are violated unethical and unjust.",59,,
369,0.97,2221.352,2233.864,Time and time again we are leading the use of force up to the discussion of officers when they lack the thinking to--[Indiscernible] black lives matter.,59,,
370,0.97,2233.864,2236.334,We are on stolen land.,59,,
371,0.97,2236.334,2238.035,"Thank you, Miriam.",60,,
372,0.97,2238.035,2243.341,That is our last public Speaker that we have showing as present.,60,,
373,0.97,2243.341,2263.861,"We do have a few people here who did not make it back in order to give public comment but--seeing how the other speakers have spoken, I am going to close the public comment now and move on to the items in our agenda for today.",60,,
374,0.97,2263.861,2273.938,"Before we move on to the first item on the agenda, I want to recognize first that Council member has joined us.",60,,
375,0.97,2273.938,2274.271,Good morning.,60,,
376,0.97,2274.271,2317.815,And I also want to just give a quick update about the results of the community safety and capacity building request for proposals from Hsd funded by $12 million to Council appropriated to build--[Indiscernible] I know people are eager to hear the outcome.,60,,
377,0.97,2317.815,2326.691,We need crime prevention and violent disruption work being done in our community.,60,,
378,0.97,2326.691,2332.596,So just a little bit of quick background.,60,,
379,0.97,2332.596,2339.103,We gave the Council $10 million for work during last summer's budget rebalancing process.,60,,
380,0.97,2339.103,2351.349,Then added another $2 million because hit not--the $10 million even though we approved it in--it--the dollars did not get out the door.,60,,
381,0.97,2351.349,2356.353,"We increased it, added another $2 million in 2021.",60,,
382,0.97,2356.353,2364.695,This funding was a really high priority and key request of Decriminalize Seattle and the King County equity now coalition.,60,,
383,0.97,2364.695,2378.109,So far we have received this committee has received a briefing from human services Department on Erp process in January.,60,,
384,0.97,2378.109,2388.753,The state director responded more fully to questions and a memo distributed to come community members in January.,60,,
385,0.97,2388.753,2406.604,Hsd released the Rfp on March 1ST which was available on Hsd's funding opportunities page and then in March my office reached out to committee members with a new memo from director with more details about their work leading up to creating the Rfp.,60,,
386,0.97,2406.604,2418.215,At the March committee meeting we received a presentation from the Mayor's office and the human services Department about the human services Department's community engagement process for the Rfp.,60,,
387,0.97,2418.215,2424.121,"The Learnings of that process, their spend plan and Rfp itself.",60,,
388,0.97,2424.121,2433.33,Following that presentation committee members and full council approved legislation that lifted the--on the fund.,60,,
389,0.97,2433.464,2447.678,[Indiscernible] they have declined and instead provided a memo back on June 16th in lieu of their participation today.,60,,
390,0.97,2447.678,2453.317,My office circulated that memo to community members yesterday.,60,,
391,0.97,2453.317,2464.562,Briefly key points contained are that the Rfp had over 70 applications requesting more than three times the available $10.4 million in funding.,60,,
392,0.97,2464.562,2482.947,At the request of applicants the human services Department Pivoted from recorded interviews during the--application process to live interviews to allow applicants to share thoughts and strategies more freely.,60,,
393,0.97,2482.947,2498.596,So we are seeing a little bit of a delay from what where was the Impended award notification period.,60,,
394,0.97,2498.596,2511.242,"The large number--provided logistical challenges, relating in resulting in a delayed contract start date of July 15th.",60,,
395,0.97,2511.242,2521.919,The Notifications were expected to go out yesterday but the human services Department let me know it is taking longer than expected.,60,,
396,0.97,2521.919,2526.824,So again the new target date for notification is July 15th.,60,,
397,0.97,2526.824,2538.636,Nhsd has condition firmed they will attend our August 10th meeting of this Committee in order to provide a comprehensive update on this really important investment.,60,,
398,0.97,2538.636,2550.347,Just wanted to give folks an update on that because I have been reporting out on the process not just in the committee but doing a little bit in full council as well.,60,,
399,0.97,2550.347,2558.222,Since we had planned to have awards on announced yesterday I wanted folks to know that they are still coming.,60,,

444,0.97,2745.742,2750.681,Just a--just general context even though chair Herbold laid it out nicely.,81,,
445,0.97,2750.681,2766.597,This is required the purpose is to check in midyear ton status of any moving parts t--the recommendations and the work in progress this year.,81,,

449,0.97,2776.573,2778.208,"Thank you, Amy.",82,,
450,0.97,2778.208,2786.984,"This is an over view of midyear, more of an update of what is going on.",82,,
451,0.97,2786.984,2787.451,Good morning everyone.,82,,
452,0.97,2787.451,2800.998,"This midyear in review we talk a little bit about the tiny results of the 2021 legislative session that is a small portion, primarily since everyone was following that we will talk about the accountability work and progress for each agency.",82,,
453,0.97,2800.998,2818.482,"So like I said I want to cover briefly we had largely successful legislative session and I will list quickly all the bills that were successful within the policing legislation, all of these were passed and have been signed into law.",82,,
454,0.97,2818.482,2830.427,Then also just a good plug for CPC we actively engaged in Olympia through various methods on 75% of these bills CH.,82,,
455,0.97,2830.427,2836.533,I am moving ton CPC work.,82,,
456,0.97,2836.533,2849.546,Some of the Publications we have are public facing work included are letter to community on the police accountability Tracker.,82,,
457,0.97,2849.546,2858.155,That is a forward facing public interactive dash board that allows folks to see all the recommendations that the partners have made.,82,,
458,0.97,2858.155,2863.894,In the letter that we published publicly wanted to talk about how did this come into existence?,82,,
459,0.97,2863.894,2866.029,How did CPC staff create the dash board?,82,,
460,0.97,2866.029,2877.941,What kind of partnership did we have with the partners so that way people can kind of walk through the process with us as we started building this back in September of 2020.,82,,
461,0.97,2877.941,2892.122,We also had a letter to the Seattle police monitor to address their draft assessment and methodology and plan so we had a hand in that and a voice at the table on things we Thid they could do differently or things we appreciated.,82,,
462,0.97,2892.122,2898.829,We also spoke to via letter to the labor relations policy committee about collective bargaining.,82,,
463,0.97,2898.829,2904.401,We hosted a series of community conversations that some of you attended.,82,,
464,0.97,2904.401,2917.18,Then also we hosted a town hall in February and produce Adler based on that feedback on the updates and changes to SPD's proposed changes to use of force and their crowd management policies.,82,,
465,0.97,2917.18,2920.15,All those things are housed on our Website.,82,,
466,0.97,2920.15,2927.024,So want to talk about challenge and opportunities we had.,82,,
467,0.97,2927.024,2931.361,One of the challenges we continue to face is Covid-19 restrictions.,82,,
468,0.97,2931.361,2933.53,Covid is as we know not over.,82,,
469,0.97,2933.53,2969.533,"Some of plus be returning to work in a couple of months but as embedded in the community one of the challenges that have persisted and I think we have done well is how do we continue to engage with the community in a meaningful way to receive feedback, to hear their concerns, to hear their fears, to hear the things like this went really well for us so continuing to have our zoom platform meetings reaching out folks in a virtual way and then as we move forward from this challenge arises opportunities to still maintain those virtual platforms.",82,,
470,0.97,2969.533,2972.969,We noticed some accessibility increased and also eventually returning face to face.,82,,
471,0.97,2972.969,2981.345,So it was a challenge but also an opportunity.,82,,
472,0.97,2981.345,2983.547,We largely have brand new staff.,82,,
473,0.97,2983.547,2989.486,We have a new executive director and recently appointed seven new commissioners.,82,,
474,0.97,2989.486,2999.363,"With that always with--when you have new staff, new Commission, there is always a challenge of on boarding folks, getting them up to speed and building those relationships.",82,,
475,0.97,2999.363,3011.675,"I say building relationships because it also presents as an opportunity to reform, Rebrand those relationships and to have something new in terms of a rebirth and how partnership and collaboration can come together table.",82,,
476,0.97,3011.675,3023.787,So it was a challenge we were very excited to see those opportunity vary and grow.,82,,
477,0.97,3023.787,3030.727,"We are very pleased and very happy to have had the police accountability recommendation Tracker, part.",82,,
478,0.97,3030.727,3031.795,This was published in April.,82,,
479,0.97,3031.795,3033.63,It went live on our Website.,82,,
480,0.97,3033.63,3038.568,It is a but lick facing interactive dash board.,82,,
481,0.97,3038.568,3050.047,"Folks can go in and see what recommendations were made by whom, to what agency, what was the response, what was the recommendation that was made, what did it say?",82,,
482,0.97,3050.047,3061.291,It's a links to the original report are weather that recommendation originated--where that recommendation originated.,82,,
483,0.97,3061.291,3063.393,We also have that available for folks on the Website.,82,,
484,0.97,3063.393,3068.065,"We can back up and show Hey, this is where this came from.",82,,
485,0.97,3068.065,3073.87,What this also does is allows people to see the status of that recommendation.,82,,
486,0.97,3073.87,3078.241,Has it been implemented?,82,,
487,0.97,3078.241,3079.676,Is it still in progress?,82,,
488,0.97,3079.676,3100.063,"So the next steps with this process that we are currently in with our partners and the accountability system is making sure that we have the accuracy of the information that was received, that we are updating that and that our internal reporting process is to each other that we are on the same page, we are doing this in a consistent manner.",82,,
489,0.97,3100.063,3109.94,"One that everyone AGREES to so we aren't reporting out anything that Mischaracterizes a recommendation or a status update, implementation.",82,,
490,0.97,3109.94,3113.777,We are giving everyone the most up to date and accurate information.,82,,
491,0.97,3113.777,3121.751,"So, that work is still on going but it is up and running and we are very pleased.",82,,
492,0.97,3121.751,3121.952,Okay.,82,,
493,0.97,3121.952,3131.228,Another piece that CPC has always had but recently we have started to relaunch are our CPC work groups.,82,,
494,0.97,3131.228,3136.099,These work groups are housed by CPC and housed by commissioners.,82,,
495,0.97,3136.099,3137.334,We just talked about state legislative agenda.,82,,
496,0.97,3137.334,3147.477,That is one of the work groups that will be coming back Online next month as a senior policy advisor.,82,,
497,0.97,3147.477,3159.322,So right now what is up and running are our police practices work group which is largely focused on demonstration management and kind of reviewing and tracking some of that work.,82,,
498,0.97,3159.322,3181.711,We are coming Online with behavioral health and we are really excited to have two particular commissioners who are leading the charge in this work and our behavioral health will focus on SPD's responses to crisis but also officer wellness so a balance there.,82,,
499,0.97,3181.711,3185.048,Our community engagement work group is on going continuing.,82,,
500,0.97,3185.048,3188.251,We are going to have some new commissioners leave that charge.,82,,
501,0.97,3188.251,3198.562,We have a meeting coming up on July 20th and we will have some exciting input from community as we start to build and craft our community engagement strategy.,82,,
502,0.97,3198.562,3201.531,I encourage every one to attend.,82,,
503,0.97,3201.531,3209.706,Lastly our complaint at E--complainant appeals process.,82,,
504,0.97,3209.706,3214.244,We are working to see how we can start that work.,82,,
505,0.97,3214.244,3218.882,We have a nice picture here of one of our commissioners.,82,,
506,0.97,3218.882,3220.55,"So, our community engagement and event.",82,,
507,0.97,3220.55,3239.002,As we talked about earlier our two largest events of this year that happened earlier in February we had a town hall to receive community feedback and do education around the policies updates from SPD about the use of force and crowd management so that was one heavily attended.,82,,
508,0.97,3239.002,3242.772,Largely successful that resulted in recommendations.,82,,
509,0.97,3242.772,3247.777,Secondly we had two separate community conversations about collective bargaining agreements.,82,,
510,0.97,3247.777,3263.226,One was also in most of our work as an education offer information and also receive feedback from the community on the ways in which they felt that we should move recommendations we should make and then we also had results in recommendations.,82,,
511,0.97,3263.226,3270.166,We also have had some Uptick in the collaboration with the Seattle police monitor.,82,,

518,0.97,3318.782,3323.887,We are working towards how we can better engage with youth and young people within Seattle.,82,,
519,0.97,3323.887,3332.329,"I think we all understand that young people are leading the charge within police reform, police over sight and really speaking up which is awesome.",82,,
520,0.97,3332.329,3339.869,We want to make sure that we are engaging with them in the best way for them and in partnership.,82,,
521,0.97,3339.869,3343.973,We want to continue the virtual community engagement throughout the pandemic.,82,,

543,0.97,3512.809,3544.207,"Appreciate the work groups are all operating and that the recommendation Tracker is a tool that is up and running for accountability for your recommendations and just finally I want to make a point of appreciating the work you have done to in advance of the legislative session to identify what your priorities are are, that has allowed know advocate including your priorities in the cities annual legislative agenda.",83,,
544,0.97,3544.207,3556.452,"Really impressed by the amount of work you have done, strength that has been in the organization at a very, very difficult time.",83,,
545,0.97,3556.452,3557.253,Very impressive.,83,,
546,0.97,3557.253,3557.854,Thank you.,83,,
547,0.97,3557.854,3560.857,We will take them.,84,,
548,0.97,3560.857,3561.291,Thank you so much.,84,,
549,0.97,3561.291,3568.932,Our staff is--I will say they are just incredible people that we get to work with everyday with the support of the commissioners.,84,,
550,0.97,3568.932,3577.473,I am very excited to see what we will continue do.,84,,
551,0.97,3577.473,3577.874,I thank you.,84,,
552,0.97,3577.874,3578.975,I really appreciate that.,84,,
553,0.97,3578.975,3579.943,Thank you Madam chair.,85,,
554,0.97,3579.943,3585.848,In regards to Oig I think you are all aware we have four main areas of function.,85,,
555,0.97,3585.848,3586.683,I will Recap briefly.,85,,
556,0.97,3586.683,3592.188,We do Audits of SPD and OPA al.,85,,
557,0.97,3592.188,3602.332,"We have a policy best practice, a pretty data heavy function to look at ways to improve the system based on innovations that are out there nationwide.",85,,
558,0.97,3602.332,3606.703,We also have the function to review OPA case work specifically.,85,,
559,0.97,3606.703,3611.007,I know there has been mention of that in the public comment period.,85,,
560,0.97,3611.007,3623.353,And then the other category I just lump into strategic leadership areas where the inspector General is involved in both the consent decree work and also other city efforts to further accountability.,85,,
561,0.97,3623.353,3632.495,The presentation today talks about the work we are doing in those four general areas.,85,,
562,0.97,3632.495,3639.902,So for 2021 I think for Oig it really does feel like 2020 part two.,85,,
563,0.97,3639.902,3651.214,That a lot of things that were set in motion last year are continuing.,85,,
564,0.97,3651.214,3659.088,"The mass demonstration, police protest rests on and community trust around issues of use of force.",85,,
565,0.97,3659.088,3665.061,The main project I want to highlight today is the sentinel event review.,85,,
566,0.97,3665.061,3676.305,This is something that has in terms of the midyear report has occupied Y 25% of our staff have been working on this project.,85,,
567,0.97,3676.305,3692.155,It is big because early on midyear last year the city was interested in how to improve its response to police protest and looking at that from a sentinel event review lens has given Oit ability to--this isn't a disciplinary look.,85,,
568,0.97,3692.155,3704.567,This is a systemic look that being the Oig charge to look at what is--what has caused the way police has responded--the way the public has reacted and how to have a better city response going forward.,85,,
569,0.97,3704.567,3727.824,"So one of the key aspects of this process has been that it has been as community centered as we can make it and so it is the sentinel event review is a model used in the airline and medical field for instance to look at tragedies that have happened to find ways to keep that plane from going down, to keep the death on the operating table from happening.",85,,
570,0.97,3727.824,3748.711,So in this case what is novel about it is the inspector general wanted to apply that model to police protests which aren't a single tragedy but a long series of recurring events over a long period over time and she brought community and SPD to the table to have that conversation.,85,,
571,0.97,3748.711,3752.515,So if you want to advance the slide.,85,,
572,0.97,3752.515,3764.327,"Part of building the sentinel event review and making it community centered is that there is a planning group of community members, law enforcement and other stake holders talking about what should the Sental event review look at.",85,,
573,0.97,3764.327,3785.014,"So if you look at the Ark of use of force overtime, that is this particular graph or any other sources of data looking in--there were trends and patterns over the period of protests of what was happening on the ground and how police were responding.",85,,
574,0.97,3785.014,3792.955,So this particular slide is just to illustrate that Oig took a lot of data and that is where the policy staff really came I.,85,,
575,0.97,3792.955,3799.262,They did a lot of data mining to look at what was happening and where were the logical pieces of information.,85,,
576,0.97,3799.262,3803.633,These were--these are broken out into you can see various spikes.,85,,
577,0.97,3803.633,3812.675,So the work that is going on right now is to have the panel look at those first few days where you can see there was a lot of heavy activity.,85,,
578,0.97,3812.675,3820.082,So the planning group is our way of having community and law enforcement voice come together to say what should we look at?,85,,
579,0.97,3820.082,3828.691,"Obviously what you look at can really set the tone for what you conclude and--you know, what aspects are explored.",85,,
580,0.97,3828.691,3834.53,It sets the tone and so it was important to have community voice up front.,85,,
581,0.97,3834.53,3853.082,Then the panelists themselves selected with the assistance of the planning group is also a mix of community and law enforcement and I just really can't do justice in this presentation with lone voice to express how remarkable the conversations have been.,85,,
582,0.97,3853.082,3883.746,"Just a huge commitment of time from the volunteer community panelists and also from law enforcement at the table really talking through these issues and the hope is that the recommendations that they are--of what they saw and what was important to all of them based on the expertise they brought to the table, we are hoping those recommendation which are coming out soon will Resonate with both with the community and the city in terms of next steps and what can improve.",85,,
583,0.97,3883.746,3885.081,Turning to the next slide.,85,,
584,0.97,3885.081,3894.59,"Um, so that is sentinel that has really--that is our midyear report.",85,,
585,0.97,3894.59,3917.079,"In addition, the other aspects recognizing the intersection of community protests and policing Oig also has been under taking examinations looking particularly at response to people in crisis and this is some work that is being done in this case in this particular bullet point looking at things actually that went well.",85,,
586,0.97,3917.079,3946.609,So the idea is we are both looking at where--when there is a use of force that maybe out of policy then there is a whole mechanism that is in place to look at those and the idea here was to look at are there also lessons to be learned where sometimes things go well to bring those forward and emphasize those good practices in addition to calling out where things need to change that are not being done well.,85,,
587,0.97,3946.609,3952.949,Pursue policies that had some coverage in these state legislative session as well.,85,,
588,0.97,3952.949,3962.491,A particular interest from Oig on examining and providing some assistance to SPD and looking at their pursuit policies and the impact that has on public safety.,85,,
589,0.97,3962.491,3985.915,"Then the other one that will I call out in terms of how everyone is within Oig is looking at how the system is changing, how police are pose responding and looking at minor traffic offenses.",85,,
590,0.97,3985.915,4004.967,"So that body of work, that will be stake holder led where the inspector General is convening experts to come in and weigh in on the impacts and move that conversation forward.",85,,
591,0.97,4004.967,4005.401,"Next slide, please.",85,,
592,0.97,4005.401,4011.107,On the audit front you will see that theme of things that have come up in 2020.,85,,
593,0.97,4011.107,4011.54,Mask wearing review.,85,,
594,0.97,4011.54,4017.58,There was a matter brought to our attention about whether SPD officers were wearing masks.,85,,
595,0.97,4017.58,4026.822,So that is review that is in progress looking at compliance with mask wearing policies and that report should be coming out in the fear future as well.,85,,
596,0.97,4026.822,4043.039,Mutualed at it--mutual aid has been on our work plan for some time.,85,,
597,0.97,4043.039,4051.781,The idea there is to look at how other agencies respond and assist SPD and the policies and practices around that.,85,,
598,0.97,4051.781,4057.62,There has been historically some interest in immigration issues around mutual aid and other such topics of interest.,85,,
599,0.97,4057.62,4062.958,So the mutual aid audit looks at those kinds of components.,85,,
600,0.97,4062.958,4073.169,The one major new audit that has really taken off this year is in the area of discipline and this is one that will also be wrapping up later this year.,85,,
601,0.97,4073.169,4078.441,Looking at the discipline process it has been a topic of court concern.,85,,
602,0.97,4078.441,4100.796,"It has ban topic of the Council and the city in general has had a lot of eyes on the discipline question and so looking at it from the time there is an OPA determination through to what happens at the disciplinary hearing and the appeal process and so forth looking at the timeliness t completeness of the response, whether it is fair, trance parent, looking from an accountability perspective.",85,,
603,0.97,4100.796,4104.133,So I think that will be a very interesting one when it comes out.,85,,
604,0.97,4104.133,4107.703,I don't need to go into detail about all of these.,85,,
605,0.97,4107.703,4108.337,This is just a highlight.,85,,
606,0.97,4108.337,4121.217,There is on going bodies of work going on in our audit and review for this list in particular is focused on SPD.,85,,
607,0.97,4121.217,4126.789,"So next slide, please.",85,,
608,0.97,4126.789,4126.956,Ton.,85,,
609,0.97,4126.956,4138.667,On the review front--[Indiscernible] it is over sight of over sight if you will.,85,,
610,0.97,4138.667,4146.609,Civilian led and in this case so I have on the slide--one of the charges we do is we look at whether OPA is classifying cases correctly.,85,,
611,0.97,4146.609,4156.051,So part of that is it is not just a matter of is an investigation thorough but there is a decision when a complaint comes in of should it be investigated.,85,,
612,0.97,4156.051,4166.328,So there is a check built into that system to make sure that everyone is in agreement that the things that should be investigated are being investigated.,85,,
613,0.97,4166.328,4185.548,"Then once it gets to an investigation stage then Oig will issue Certifications and those are Certifications on whether it is timely, thorough and objective and there were 142 as of mid June but just to give you a sense of volume and updating the slide there have been 208 as of today.",85,,
614,0.97,4185.548,4200.996,You can see just in the span of a month there is a lot of on going investigative work that op Ark does and then correspondingly that is a wave that then comes over and hits Oig in terms of performing a review of those.,85,,
615,0.97,4200.996,4210.272,"I would say for OPA review in terms of a midyear status, far and away it is the certification process that has been consuming the resources.",85,,
616,0.97,4210.272,4225.12,"What has happened is when the protests happened last year, there were of course it goes through--there is a complaint and then there is an investigation which can have usually a 180 day clock on it.",85,,
617,0.97,4225.12,4228.924,Then Oit gets a completed investigation to look at.,85,,
618,0.97,4228.924,4238.0,We are really seeing a heavy volume in early 2021 with just the culmination of reviewing OPA's work that occurred in 2020.,85,,
619,0.97,4238.0,4250.946,"With the protest cases in particular, they tend to be more complex and more compilations because if you recall, OPA got 19,000 complaints.",85,,
620,0.97,4250.946,4259.888,"When we are in the hundreds of investigations, anyone of those investigations can actually have a lot of issues or concerns contained within it.",85,,
621,0.97,4259.888,4266.228,So that really has been the heavy lift for resources in this area.,85,,
622,0.97,4266.228,4268.163,Separately I think these are on the slide.,85,,
623,0.97,4268.163,4278.974,Other areas of work that are within our charge looking at other methods by which cases or issues are addressed or resolved.,85,,
624,0.97,4278.974,4288.717,"Bias reviews, we start add project could be sill member Herbold in regards to one of your questions about how our bias reviews are conducted, how are they done across the country?",85,,
625,0.97,4288.717,4291.487,Are there better ways to do it?,85,,
626,0.97,4291.487,4292.454,Taking a closer examination of that.,85,,
627,0.97,4292.454,4295.357,So that is all I have to say on that one.,85,,
628,0.97,4295.357,4295.791,"Next slide, please.",85,,
629,0.97,4295.791,4297.726,--,85,,
630,0.97,4297.726,4301.597,"I want to pause here, please on this slide.",86,,
631,0.97,4301.597,4301.864,Thank you.,86,,
632,0.97,4301.864,4303.899,I see that Council member Lewis has a question.,86,,
633,0.97,4303.899,4306.301,I have a question as well.,86,,
634,0.97,4306.301,4312.841,"As it relates to the certification of investigations, are you reporting here full Certifications?",86,,
635,0.97,4312.841,4325.754,I know there has been recently a lot of attention to partial Certifications and I am also curious as to whether or not there is a number of investigations that weren't certified at all.,86,,
636,0.97,4325.754,4328.29,"Um, very good question, council member.",87,,
637,0.97,4328.29,4331.627,The 208 is our body of work.,87,,
638,0.97,4331.627,4335.564,So anything we issue a certification regardless of the income is 208 total.,87,,
639,0.97,4335.564,4337.533,So that is the body of work done.,87,,
640,0.97,4337.533,4342.871,"In terms of Partials, I can get you the specific number after this.",87,,
641,0.97,4342.871,4348.243,The full certification rate of timely objective thorough is about 95%.,87,,
642,0.97,4348.243,4362.558,Then so in about 5% of the cases there would be a partial certification where a case might be on any of those criteria would be a partial.,87,,
643,0.97,4362.558,4371.1,"Timeliness is around the areas of f there is a missed deadline of some kind, that would be the most likely trigger.",87,,
644,0.97,4371.1,4386.882,"Opportunity to correct a particular deficiency and then thoroughness, I think some of those would be--just for example whether there was a certain line of questioning that--Oit felt should have been pursued that was relevant to the case.",87,,
645,0.97,4386.882,4387.883,It would be examples like that.,87,,
646,0.97,4387.883,4395.958,"One thing I was going to say in terms of Partials, um--sorry, it escaped me.",87,,
647,0.97,4395.958,4400.062,That is okay.,88,,
648,0.97,4400.062,4402.498,We will go to Council member Lewis' question.,88,,
649,0.97,4402.498,4415.411,I don't know if it was this slide or the last one but my question is about the auditing of discipline and accountability.,89,,
650,0.97,4415.411,4423.519,This might be--this might be feedback for Scoping questions as we under take that work in the future work plan.,89,,
651,0.97,4423.519,4442.204,Madam chair talked about this a little bit yesterday during briefing about efforts in the Seattle police Department to respond to what is really becoming a national problem around extremism in the ranks of law enforcement and anti-democratic sentiment.,89,,
652,0.97,4442.204,4443.839,I might have a follow up question.,89,,
653,0.97,4443.839,4447.976,I guess I wanted to throw that out there as a Scoping thing.,89,,
654,0.97,4447.976,4451.847,It seems right for a discipline and accountability audit.,89,,
655,0.97,4451.847,4457.519,I wanted to throw that out first and I will--I will almost certainly have a follow up to this.,89,,
656,0.97,4457.519,4460.322,I wanted to throw that out there.,89,,
657,0.97,4460.322,4504.066,"Before you take that, Amy, as it relates to that particular issue around extremism and identifying it within the ranks, it is my understanding that part of the bias review work that you are doing is intended to address that issue both how we handle bias complaints but also I believe have a--body camera project that you are intending on working on to look at body camera and work with an academic to analyze how officers--season in cases where there is not an arrest but to look at how they engage differently with different people.",90,,
658,0.97,4504.066,4504.733,"Thank you, council member.",91,,
659,0.97,4504.733,4509.338,I think that is a good highlight is my list by the way is not exhaustive.,91,,
660,0.97,4509.338,4517.613,There is other projects that are on going so these are some of the highlights.,91,,
661,0.97,4517.613,4539.234,Directly to the question extremism wouldn't be--[Indiscernible] in part it is because I think extremism is coming to the forefront of conversation right now but the Aud--audit is looking at the disciplinary practices of what has been imposed.,91,,
662,0.97,4539.234,4565.761,I think Council member Herbold RAISES a great point that there are other areas to try to get at some of those kinds of concepts you talking about and I think you yourself have done a really good job of highlighting there is also a distinction between extremism and just bias institutional bias and other kinds of related types of issues that come to mind for people.,91,,
663,0.97,4565.761,4575.237,"So, I think there is a lot of work certainly in the partner arena being done on disparity and bias in general.",91,,
664,0.97,4575.237,4578.974,The--we have a couple.,91,,
665,0.97,4578.974,4581.944,Making sure I'm tracking what we are talking about.,91,,
666,0.97,4581.944,4608.637,We are looking at professionalism and that is really early stages with just part of the reason why it hasn't made this highlights list of just understanding that the interactions people that law enforcement officers have on a day to day basis has a cumulative large impact on public trust and getting a better handle and review of what are those professionalism instances and how have they been treated?,91,,
667,0.97,4608.637,4610.372,How have they been addressed?,91,,
668,0.97,4610.372,4614.876,Are there systemic issues coming out from that?,91,,
669,0.97,4614.876,4631.793,We are looking to partner with other institutions to look at disparity through body worn Video and or use of force reports or bias reviews or any of those other documents and part of the challenge is the city is a very large city and there is a lot of incidents.,91,,
670,0.97,4631.793,4639.635,"So some of the challenge around this is how do you pull up bows of interactions, right?",91,,
671,0.97,4639.635,4659.221,Parent of--part of it is looking up things like natural language processing or other ways to just pull the most likely cases to look at.,91,,
672,0.97,4659.221,4663.392,I'm sorry I'm veering off into technical territory losing the audience probably.,91,,
673,0.97,4663.392,4665.927,"But, so, a lot of work.",91,,
674,0.97,4665.927,4672.868,I think it is worth further conversations just in terms of where all of those different avenues can go.,91,,
675,0.97,4672.868,4675.937,There are definitely a lot of intersections.,91,,
676,0.97,4675.937,4690.819,"Just--even some of these others just the impact on racial disparity implications, public trust implications, in terms of interactions, professionalism plays that role there.",91,,
677,0.97,4690.819,4703.432,"Even the mask wearing, anything that is--the culture of SPD, how it presents to the public I think is--now I'm getting way far field from extremism the original question.",91,,
678,0.97,4703.432,4711.373,I do think that they all tie into cultural aspects with racial aspects of the partners you are looking at.,91,,
679,0.97,4711.373,4738.767,"And, um, I just want to also highlight that I have asked that the Oig consider the use of climate surveys as recommended by some best practices to actually hear from officers about their experiences of white supremacy, racism and extremism in the workplace because as we have heard white supremacy affects officers of color.",92,,
680,0.97,4738.767,4746.508,Trying to get at that in a more systematic way will be useful to our efforts.,92,,
681,0.97,4746.508,4749.945,Ready to move on to the next slide if you are.,93,,
682,0.97,4749.945,4759.454,I did have some quick follow UPS on the topic.,94,,
683,0.97,4759.454,4773.668,I do think--I was--I think more broadly what I'm trying to get at and I appreciate an over view of a lot of the methods and Scoping but I want to bring it back to something very tangible.,94,,
684,0.97,4773.668,4791.186,I think it is clear that not wearing a mask and being--about it as an officer and gosh like a case of f an officer used a racial Slur against somebody clearly would be unprofessional.,94,,
685,0.97,4791.186,4803.298,I don't understand why anti Democratic sentiment as expressed that is called stop the steal is not considered in those same categories.,94,,
686,0.97,4803.298,4828.123,I think it would warrant an audit to get at some of the fundamental under pinnings of the recent determination by the day Trekker to that there are free speech--[Indiscernible] that are not triggered by similar free speech rights people might have to not wear a mask or to say a racial Slur in public.,94,,
687,0.97,4828.123,4831.059,Americans have a right to say a racial Slur in public.,94,,
688,0.97,4831.059,4843.505,You don't have a right to do that when you are a police officer because it is unprofessional.,94,,
689,0.97,4843.505,4858.954,You can't engage for racist activity.,94,,
690,0.97,4858.954,4870.665,I just don't understand how that is not professional in the same way as a lot of these other activities that could have speech implications but we have determined they are not Professionl and people could be disciplined for them.,94,,
691,0.97,4870.665,4875.57,I think that that would warrant as Scoping an assessment.,94,,
692,0.97,4875.57,4882.711,I Undrstand it was tough call the director had to make.,94,,
693,0.97,4882.711,4890.452,I don't see how we can have faith in these officers that attended the rally but didn't engage in the insurrection directly.,94,,
694,0.97,4890.452,4892.32,I think there is professionalism concerns.,94,,
695,0.97,4892.32,4895.557,I think that there they are very concerning.,94,,
696,0.97,4895.557,4911.406,"I don't think we can normalize the big lie and activities that are related to the big lie under the banner that that is just normal political behavior, it isn't.",94,,
697,0.97,4911.406,4930.091,It is not the same as believing in trickle down economics or believing in--like having different opinions on if there should be a capital gains tax.,94,,
698,0.97,4930.091,4937.232,This is fundamental to the social contract and the monopoly or force they hold to protect.,94,,
699,0.97,4937.232,4946.041,"I wanted to throw that out there as I think I'm talking about fundamental, as part of this professional review really Gramming with those questions.",94,,
700,0.97,4946.041,4953.348,I don't think it is just this sort of you know--jet son sharks division we are in different sides.,94,,
701,0.97,4953.348,4954.349,It is more fundamental than that.,94,,
702,0.97,4954.349,4963.725,It is say you don't believe in Dem a Democrat a democratic system of government.,94,,
703,0.97,4963.725,4987.015,"Without speaking to the OPA case in particular but in regards to my comments earlier just to be clear on what I'm expressing, professionalism for me would be an overall umbrella that encompasses a lot of things.",95,,
704,0.97,4987.015,5001.596,My point would be it is not sufficient to address extremism for the points you raising that there are unique aspects to extremism that aren't necessarily part of the base of professionalism.,95,,
705,0.97,5001.596,5019.581,"Over lapping concepts but that is to study it and do--for instance for the survey, the climate survey that the chair is talking about, a survey about professionalism in general won't get us there.",95,,
706,0.97,5019.581,5025.186,If that helps clarify.,95,,
707,0.97,5025.186,5027.222,It does.,96,,
708,0.97,5027.222,5100.562,"Would there be a way to scope an audit on the question of--Certifications, partial Certifications or Certifications that Oig has not not approved and link that to the question of whether or not an investigation is complete because of how it looks at that question of protected free speech and professionalism because Council member lieu basis correct that the courts have been latitude to law enforcement agencies when it comes to restricting free speech of officers in those instances where there is a connection between the conduct and their responsibilities and has allowed law enforcement agencies to restrict speech and Association fighting specific--the heightened need for order, loyalty, moral and harmony.",96,,
709,0.97,5100.562,5108.803,I'm wondering whether or not there is a way to use the process that includes the Oig certification to look at this issue as well.,96,,
710,0.97,5108.803,5113.675,I think it is something we can talk with you further about.,97,,
711,0.97,5113.675,5122.383,I think you always have a really creative way to think about the ways in which one piece Enforms the other.,97,,
712,0.97,5122.383,5125.053,Happy to have that continued conversation with you.,97,,
713,0.97,5125.053,5126.087,Yeah.,98,,
714,0.97,5126.087,5130.058,This question of a come--the Congresswoman Pleatness of an investigation.,98,,
715,0.97,5130.058,5165.226,This particular investigation that we are talking about right now has--raised the question for many of us of whether or not that was a complete investigation because of--this determination that the free speech rights of the officers sort of Trump our Peckations for expectations for how they do their job.,98,,
716,0.97,5165.226,5165.66,Yeah.,99,,
717,0.97,5165.66,5182.544,They do tend to be individual case specific investigator specific determination Whoofs--determination Whoofs worked in that particular situation without going to some of those larger principle use talking about.,99,,
718,0.97,5182.544,5192.687,They do inform--we are looking for trends of how OPA in general approaches cases.,99,,
719,0.97,5192.687,5201.596,I think you asking a very specific question about investigations in this particular.,99,,
720,0.97,5201.596,5206.0,Definitely worth further conversation with you to think that through.,99,,
721,0.97,5206.0,5206.334,Thank you.,100,,
722,0.97,5206.334,5210.905,"So if we are ready to advance to the next slide, then.",101,,
723,0.97,5210.905,5219.213,This is just a highlight.,101,,
724,0.97,5219.347,5240.635,[Indiscernible] the process will be continuing throughout the year.,101,,
725,0.97,5240.635,5268.429,Oig is part of that process and so looking at use of force crowd management policy having those conversations with the partners and some of that has come up in the sentinel review as well.,101,,
726,0.97,5268.429,5283.177,"I think really truly it has been a collaborative conversation around what are those policies, how have they manifested and how can they be improved.",101,,
727,0.97,5283.177,5301.396,Just quickly on the last slide we talked about our certification of other people's work.,101,,
728,0.97,5301.396,5305.466,We recognize there is a lot of work to be done internally as well.,101,,
729,0.97,5305.466,5323.217,"Just in the spirit of always trying to improve where we are at, the inspector General is in the process of setting all community advisory group to help ensure her thoughts are reflecting the community's priorities as well.",101,,
730,0.97,5323.351,5351.813,"[Indiscernible] so, with that that is our year so far.",101,,
731,0.97,5351.813,5358.086,"If you have no further questions, I would turn it over to OPA to wrap up.",101,,
732,0.97,5358.086,5358.453,Thank you.,102,,
733,0.97,5358.453,5362.724,As I said earlier my name is Lauren.,103,,
734,0.97,5362.724,5364.926,Thyme data and policy analyst for OPA.,103,,
735,0.97,5364.926,5371.933,I will talk about our policy recommendations which are called management action recommendations or Mars.,103,,
736,0.97,5371.933,5382.643,Mars are a tool to clarify or correct gaps in SPD policy and training.,103,,
737,0.97,5382.643,5383.478,They come about.,103,,
738,0.97,5383.478,5391.519,We are will turn it over to SPD.,103,,
739,0.97,5391.519,5397.091,We will ask them to fix whatever is missing in SPD policy or training.,103,,
740,0.97,5397.091,5403.564,Spd is not required to implement Mars but do work with us to find these solutions.,103,,
741,0.97,5403.564,5409.07,There is no required Timeline for SPD to complete these recommendations.,103,,
742,0.97,5409.07,5430.825,It often depends on the complexity of the recommendation or SPD's scheduled policy review cycles but in general about four months to a year and we meet quarterly with SPD to discuss the status of active recommendations.,103,,
743,0.97,5430.825,5431.259,"Next slide, please.",103,,
744,0.97,5431.259,5443.304,This year in 2021 we have issued Mars on 14 unique topics and as of yesterday now 15.,103,,
745,0.97,5443.304,5444.472,We issued one yesterday.,103,,
746,0.97,5444.472,5449.277,12 of the 15 resulted from protest cases.,103,,
747,0.97,5449.277,5453.614,"They include blast balls, changing the blast ball policy.",103,,
748,0.97,5453.614,5466.494,"Long range acoustic device which is Lrad, providing medical raid and demonstration such as when protesters are hit with pepper spray.",103,,
749,0.97,5466.494,5469.864,"Screening social media posts, things of that sort.",103,,
750,0.97,5469.864,5475.303,They have been completed and both were fully implemented.,103,,
751,0.97,5475.303,5478.506,Enforcement towards media and complex incident command.,103,,
752,0.97,5478.506,5488.449,That one was strengthening incident action plans or Iaps and just having a stronger command over officers working protests.,103,,
753,0.97,5488.449,5491.485,Then 12 topics are still active this year.,103,,
754,0.97,5491.485,5504.065,Since Mars carry over often into the next year our next slide which we can go to summarizes our 2020 Mars which some are still open.,103,,
755,0.97,5504.065,5507.268,Next slide please.,103,,
756,0.97,5507.401,5537.064,"[Indiscernible] body worn Video recording, employee wellness and handling money evidence and recording that on body worn Video.",103,,
757,0.97,5537.064,5548.509,One Mar was partially implemented which was strengthening special Commission permits and restrictions on who can have a special Commission permit.,103,,
758,0.97,5548.509,5550.511,Then two were declined actions.,103,,
759,0.97,5550.511,5564.392,"One the leadership expectations one, SPD did not have the resources to implement that and then the sound transit let Ce--[Indiscernible] that one was also declined by SPD.",103,,
760,0.97,5564.392,5572.7,Then six Mars from 2020 are still active.,103,,
761,0.97,5572.7,5575.836,That is all we have.,103,,
762,0.97,5575.836,5576.237,Great.,104,,
763,0.97,5576.237,5576.57,Thank you.,105,,
764,0.97,5576.57,5594.055,Checking to see whether or not we have any questions for the OPA on their contribution to the work plan here today.,105,,
765,0.97,5594.055,5595.089,Just checking my notes.,105,,
766,0.97,5595.089,5628.089,Really appreciate that management action recommendations are also listed on the Website as well as listing the status of the recommendations so that it gives policy makers an opportunity to inquire but with the Department on a status but also gives the general public the opportunity to see what has been recommended and what has been implemented.,105,,
767,0.97,5628.089,5629.19,Really appreciate that addition.,105,,
768,0.97,5629.19,5696.457,I want to invite you Lauren on behalf of OPA to offer any comments you might as it relates to the earlier discussion that we directed around the memos t investigation certification memos or the conversation that we had around investigations also looking broadly at anti-democratic behavior on the part of police officers that can have a negative impact both on policing and community relations but when the anti-democratic behavior is examples of extremism or racism it also has effect on other officers who work within the Department as well and if--giving you the opportunity to comment on that issue as it relates to OPA's investigations.,105,,
769,0.97,5696.457,5700.127,On the topic I would have to send that back to the director.,106,,
770,0.97,5700.127,5703.197,I wouldn't be able to comment on that.,106,,
771,0.97,5703.197,5715.242,I believe somewhere in the upper 90% of our investigations are fully certified by Oig but without Commenting further on that specific case or on the topic of extremism.,106,,
772,0.97,5715.242,5725.686,I would--push that to the director.,106,,
773,0.97,5725.686,5727.221,Understood.,107,,
774,0.97,5727.221,5731.792,Thank you.,107,,
775,0.97,5731.792,5751.312,The other questions from Council members before we close this conversation out or any other questions from any of the other panel members recognizing we also have SPD recognize participating here as well?,107,,
776,0.97,5751.312,5755.416,And I thank everybody for their participation here today.,107,,
777,0.97,5755.416,5774.535,And look forward to on going conversations about your work and about how we can together work through approve accountability of our Seattle police Department.,107,,
778,0.97,5774.535,5774.835,Thank you.,107,,
779,0.97,5774.835,5785.98,"Item number two, pay out policy proposal briefing and discussion.",108,,
780,0.97,5785.98,5786.38,Thank you.,109,,
781,0.97,5786.38,5818.112,We have been meeting weekly since June 9th and have had robust stake holder conversations and she is going to--she has presentation but first we will--before we jump into the presentation we will--hear from--a--I believe we will first hear--to hear a couple of workers talk about sort of the need for the--for--for this discussion.,109,,
782,0.97,5818.112,5827.321,We will--over the policy proposal for the areas we have discussed and just kind of briefly go over the high level areas of discussion.,109,,
783,0.97,5827.321,5841.468,We will not go deep into the stake holder feedback on each of those areas but that is all captured in the--in the presentation itself.,109,,
784,0.97,5841.468,5847.041,So am I missing anything as far as what the--what the--run of show is here today?,109,,
785,0.97,5847.041,5848.676,I think that is great.,110,,
786,0.97,5848.676,5864.925,I think it might be helpful if Karina presented her first Sleight slide and then we will turn it over to them.,110,,
787,0.97,5864.925,5866.093,Thank you so much.,111,,
788,0.97,5866.093,5866.46,Karina.,112,,
789,0.97,5866.46,5872.466,Handing it over to you.,112,,
790,0.97,5872.466,5872.833,Good morning.,113,,
791,0.97,5872.833,5873.567,I am Karina.,113,,
792,0.97,5873.567,5881.642,I will pull up the slide presentation.,113,,
793,0.97,5881.642,5900.461,So what I have attempted to do here is as best as possible still a very comprehensive proposal for a--[Indiscernible] these protections will be separated into a number of ordinances.,113,,
794,0.97,5900.461,5904.231,We are focussing just on the policies right now.,113,,
795,0.97,5904.231,5932.092,"There have been stake holder meetings on minimum compensation, transparency, flexibility, deactivation and then moving forward there will be discussion of other topics including background checks, access to Restroom, civil rights protections such as protections against discrimination and right to reasonable accommodations and also the establishment of an App based workers advisory board.",113,,
796,0.97,5932.092,5937.831,Here is a proposed Timeline for those remaining stake holder meetings.,113,,
797,0.97,5937.831,5948.208,Just a note that I believe that the committee meeting for September 14th is still being determined as far as the subject matter content for that meeting.,113,,
798,0.97,5948.208,5955.082,So with that I will stop sharing my screen and we will hear from stake holder.,113,,
799,0.97,5955.082,5960.721,"Just to clarify that last screen, that did not show all of the meetings we already had.",114,,
800,0.97,5960.721,5964.258,It shows the meetings we haven't yet had.,114,,
801,0.97,5964.258,5964.558,Correct.,115,,
802,0.97,5964.558,5974.234,As you noted meeting started June 9 and covered those first four topics in an introduction.,115,,
803,0.97,5974.234,5975.135,That is the future.,115,,
804,0.97,5975.135,5975.469,Thank you.,116,,
805,0.97,5975.469,5976.303,Michael.,117,,
806,0.97,5976.303,5979.073,Got two and a half minutes please.,117,,
807,0.97,5979.073,5985.846,"Thank you, chair Herbold and members of the committee for giving me an opportunity to address you.",118,,
808,0.97,5985.846,5986.547,I'm Michael Wolf.,118,,
809,0.97,5986.547,5992.953,The issue of gig worker pay standards protections is an important one and requires serious consideration.,118,,
810,0.97,5992.953,6003.097,"As a gig worker I value the ability to use the platforms to tailor my work to my needs whether it is pay an unexpected bill, save for my son's college or take a vacation.",118,,
811,0.97,6003.097,6010.871,The beauty is I get to set my own terms.,118,,
812,0.97,6010.871,6017.911,My experience has allow Med to get a sense of the come and I what they value.,118,,
813,0.97,6017.911,6029.623,Move of what we hear stories of gig worker experiences out on the job both positive and negative.,118,,
814,0.97,6029.623,6038.665,Drive forward created a survey of at based delivery workers which we thought would be the narrow focus of this legislation.,118,,
815,0.97,6038.665,6043.237,The results confirmed what we have been hearing from our members about the work they were doing.,118,,
816,0.97,6043.237,6047.508,Gig workers are mostly part-time work force.,118,,
817,0.97,6047.508,6054.114,Gig workers are not their primary source of income.,118,,
818,0.97,6054.114,6061.355,Our survey data also confirmed and reported to us about their earnings.,118,,
819,0.97,6061.355,6066.894,Pre-Tip earnings would always hover around 15 to $25 per hour gross.,118,,
820,0.97,6066.894,6070.464,You--and really made your profits on tips.,118,,
821,0.97,6070.464,6079.44,These reports were always concerning to us as we felt they were not likely meet a reasonable earnings standard set by the city of Seattle or the state of Washington.,118,,
822,0.97,6079.44,6088.082,With this data we can say we agree with the city council working that gig work pay standard is needed.,118,,
823,0.97,6088.082,6090.451,However the devil in the details.,118,,
824,0.97,6090.451,6110.671,"While you will hear from Karina in a minute, I want to be clear the Membersof the drive forward support the creation of a pay standard that recognizes we are independent contractors, SETS a pay forward no limit on how much we can earn, does not have a severe impact on consumer demand and is driven by data.",118,,
825,0.97,6110.671,6114.842,Our biggest concern are unlike the fair share process.,118,,
826,0.97,6114.842,6122.149,There has been no attempt to collect any data to support some of the numbers being used.,118,,
827,0.97,6122.149,6127.221,The process feels very rushed with insufficient time for many of the stake holders to review the proposals being made.,118,,
828,0.97,6127.221,6133.16,"If the goal is to have final passage in December, then why rush the legislation in August?",118,,
829,0.97,6133.16,6137.731,"This process needs to be fair, open and let all voices be heard and considered.",118,,
830,0.97,6137.731,6147.608,One of the most important lessons I've learned INS last six years of working in the gig economy is a gig worker--[Indiscernible] we do not all see the work we do through the same lens.,118,,
831,0.97,6147.608,6157.818,"So it becomes particularly important when the community broadly AGREES to something needs to be done, it is best not to just do what one voice is suggesting being done.",118,,
832,0.97,6157.818,6163.223,Take time to come today six that the broad community can all support.,118,,
833,0.97,6163.223,6174.902,The city of Seattle has done this before.,118,,
834,0.97,6174.902,6175.402,Thank you for your time.,118,,
835,0.97,6175.402,6183.043,"James, please.",119,,
836,0.97,6183.043,6183.51,"You are muted, James.",119,,

840,0.97,6195.589,6203.197,"I have done post mates, Amazon, Doordash, you name it.",120,,
841,0.97,6203.197,6211.305,"In January 2017 post mates paid me $4.50 minimum, $1.17 a mile, 15 cent wait time.",120,,

845,0.97,6231.024,6233.894,Thank you for listening to that.,120,,
846,0.97,6233.894,6234.094,Okay.,120,,
847,0.97,6234.094,6246.139,Now still have not received my 1099 for post mates.,120,,
848,0.97,6246.139,6247.541,Is it rather wrong?,120,,
849,0.97,6247.674,6263.39,[Indiscernible] right now as the earth turns this shall continue for the next 20 to 30 years.,120,,
850,0.97,6263.39,6263.924,Enough is enough.,120,,
851,0.97,6263.924,6272.199,A good life is deserving to all the bodies who participate in the massive growth and success of the gig industry.,120,,
852,0.97,6272.199,6277.004,We insist drivers pay from the total profit of each and every single trip.,120,,

857,0.97,6297.658,6298.025,Okay.,120,,

861,0.97,6328.322,6341.535,We cannot allow Billionaires seeking to become Zillionaires at the cost of people of color who are the majority workers across this nation in the gig industry.,120,,
862,0.97,6341.535,6344.071,Thank you for your time.,120,,
863,0.97,6344.071,6345.138,"Thank you, James and Michael.",121,,
864,0.97,6345.138,6354.981,Really appreciate you being with us here today to help set the stage and your weekly participation in the stake holder meetings.,121,,
865,0.97,6354.981,6358.452,We will hand it over to Karina next.,121,,
866,0.97,6358.452,6382.843,In the interest of time if you could focus the discussion on sort of a description of the high level topics with an understanding that you have done a great job along with the input provided from collecting minutes from each of the meetings of capturing the stake holder feedback to the issue areas and appreciate that that is captured on the slides.,121,,
867,0.97,6382.843,6400.761,If we could--just focus the presentation on the issue areas themselves with--a hope that could that---- Council members could take sometime to look at the feedback on our respective own times.,121,,
868,0.97,6400.761,6401.027,Thank you.,121,,
869,0.97,6401.027,6407.434,I will most certainly do that.,122,,
870,0.97,6407.434,6407.701,Thank you.,122,,
871,0.97,6407.701,6413.573,Okay.,122,,
872,0.97,6413.573,6435.362,So to begin all of a these protections would apply to at based workers and that includes a range of workers who were being treated as independent contractors and who are providing on demand or Prescheduled physical services for a network company's worker platform.,122,,
873,0.97,6435.362,6442.636,As examples those could be workers who are delivering groceries or items from a store.,122,,
874,0.97,6442.636,6443.87,It could be alcohol.,122,,
875,0.97,6443.87,6449.443,It could be those would be examples of the on demand type of work.,122,,
876,0.97,6449.443,6462.422,"Prescheduled could be workers who are agreeing to perform a certain kind of service in someone's home or someone's business whether bit moving, cleaning, furniture Assembly, et cetera.",122,,
877,0.97,6462.422,6467.16,So these protections are for these physical kinds of services.,122,,
878,0.97,6467.16,6509.002,What would not be covered would--is what the legislation would term as those workers with significant bargaining power and influence over the conditions of their work and the proposal would itemize these types of workers and Online orders that would not be covered for example--work that requires a professional license to perform and those type of workers would be identified by rule and as with other labor standards this proposal is thought to be implemented by the office of labor standards so it would be rules.,122,,
879,0.97,6509.002,6523.783,"Creative work, graphic design, sale or rent offal--rental of goods--[Indiscernible] also Online orders resulting in payment of $1,000 or more.",122,,
880,0.97,6523.783,6536.83,The network companies that would be covered would be those with 250 or more at based workers worldwide.,122,,
881,0.97,6536.83,6546.873,That threshold for coverage would align with the paid sick and save time for gig workers and also the premium pay for gig workers legislation.,122,,
882,0.97,6546.873,6563.423,Not covered would be platforms that are not serving as--for the relationship between worker and company.,122,,
883,0.97,6563.423,6595.822,The first protection that will focus on is minimum compensation and the policy goal of this would be to set a single pay standard for all businesses and workers and to ensure payment of a minimum wage less expenses with a permanent and per mile floor for all engaged time and engaged miles.,122,,
884,0.97,6595.822,6606.8,Here is a--the formula this would be used to determine the pay for workers and the next slide will plug some numbers in to this formula.,122,,
885,0.97,6606.8,6642.602,The basic idea is that there would be a minimum wage equivalent which would equate to whatever the minimum wage is for that year in Seattle divided up into a permanent amount and then what is called an associated cost factor and time factor to account for all of the time that workers are spending engaged which is--if a worker ACCEPTS an often to deliver items from a grocery store they would be engaged from the moment the worker ACCEPTS the offer through completion of it.,122,,
886,0.97,6642.602,6647.24,"Going to buy the groceries, going to drive to the person's home and then delivering it.",122,,
887,0.97,6647.24,6650.543,Those would be engaged time and engaged miles as well.,122,,
888,0.97,6650.543,6656.316,"However, what is known is that that is not the only time that the worker is spending to complete that work.",122,,
889,0.97,6656.316,6658.618,There is a certain amount of waiting time.,122,,
890,0.97,6658.618,6666.059,"There is the cost of doing the work without benefits, time to review the offer, et cetera.",122,,
891,0.97,6666.059,6678.571,It is those amounts of time and expenses of the worker that are sought to be covered by an associated cost factor.,122,,
892,0.97,6678.571,6681.741,Same thing for the mileage as well.,122,,
893,0.97,6681.741,6691.251,For those familiar with the TNC driver minimum compensation that same idea is handled in a different way.,122,,
894,0.97,6691.251,6702.295,It is called a utilization rate where there were studies that were able to determine how much time drivers spent waiting for a ride for this particular proposal.,122,,
895,0.97,6702.295,6709.102,These are going to be estimates and what is known as far as the cost for certain benefits.,122,,
896,0.97,6709.102,6720.28,It would be this per engaged minute payment plus an amount of compensation to compensate the worker for their engaged mileage.,122,,
897,0.97,6720.28,6750.577,"So it would be a standard mileage rate a certain amount of money per mile and then associated mileage factor taking into account for workers it is not just the time spent driving to the grocery store and to the person's home E, it is also the amount of time to get from--to the place where they accept the offer, if they are driving very far away they need to go back to a Hub or back to the area where most of their services will begin.",122,,
898,0.97,6750.577,6753.88,"So putting this general formula, adding some numbers to it.",122,,
899,0.97,6753.88,6761.955,An example for the minimum compensation for engaged minute would be 28 cents per minute.,122,,
900,0.97,6761.955,6767.393,That is this year's minimum wage for employees in Seattle.,122,,
901,0.97,6767.393,6796.489,$16.69 divided by 60 Olympian it--minutes--[Indiscernible] the mileage rate would based on the Ir s rate which is very well known to a lot of contractors and employees.,122,,
902,0.97,6796.489,6798.258,Then that mileage factor is 1.25.,122,,
903,0.97,6798.258,6809.269,Adding those two things together would result in the minimum compensation standard for workers engaged minutes and engaged miles.,122,,
904,0.97,6809.269,6817.076,Now the next three slides will address the numbers behind each of these associated factors.,122,,
905,0.97,6817.076,6821.381,"The cost, the time and the mileage.",122,,
906,0.97,6821.381,6827.02,For the cost factor here are the items it is addressing.,122,,
907,0.97,6827.02,6833.293,Payroll tax for example contractors are paying both their own tack and what the companies are paying.,122,,
908,0.97,6833.293,6838.498,If you are an employee you are only paying 7.65.,122,,
909,0.97,6838.498,6842.268,Contractors have to pay double that amount.,122,,
910,0.97,6842.268,6855.748,Here this would reimburse the workers for what would be a standard employee amount.,122,,
911,0.97,6855.748,6870.496,All of that would equate to multiplying factor of of 1.13.,122,,
912,0.97,6870.496,6881.474,The time factor includes estimates of time to reflect the need for workers to take rest breaks Eve hour.,122,,
913,0.97,6881.474,6883.877,-- every hour.,122,,
914,0.97,6883.877,6893.319,"An estimate of time to review offers, time to make themselves available and then time to complete administrative tasks.",122,,
915,0.97,6893.319,6904.33,So you will see there what that averages out to and this time factor is 1.25.,122,,
916,0.97,6904.33,6905.832,Then Lastly associated mileage factor.,122,,
917,0.97,6905.832,6925.852,"So what this factor is taking into account is an estimate of 1.25 miles to travel to locations where the offs will be available and then 1.25 miles to travel to occasions for rest breaks, no breaks, Restroom access, et cetera.",122,,
918,0.97,6925.852,6926.719,These are based on estimates.,122,,
919,0.97,6926.719,6928.888,The stake holder slides can speak for themselves.,122,,
920,0.97,6928.888,6932.659,Some might think these are high.,122,,
921,0.97,6932.659,6934.527,Some might think these are low.,122,,
922,0.97,6934.527,6944.604,"And then similar to the TNC driver minimum compensation, any offer would be compensated as a minimum amount.",122,,
923,0.97,6944.604,6949.943,No matter whether it is--cancelled or if it would result in something less.,122,,
924,0.97,6949.943,6956.349,It is always a minimum amount of at least $5 per offer.,122,,
925,0.97,6956.349,6963.222,So that is the Summery of the minimum compensation standard.,122,,
926,0.97,6963.222,6972.932,These are slides on stake holder feedback thus far.,122,,
927,0.97,6972.932,6975.969,Then next is transparency.,122,,
928,0.97,6975.969,7007.266,These transparency--this proposal is Aligning with the idea that workers should have information and also provide information to customers and businesses on the nature of charges and the payments that are going to these workers.,122,,
929,0.97,7007.266,7028.621,These transparency proposals are aligned with that and go into much more detail than Nind contractor's legislation to focus on the unique as Pecks of at based work.,122,,
930,0.97,7028.621,7032.792,So to begin there would be information about each job offer.,122,,
931,0.97,7032.792,7045.938,Workers would have at least three minutes to consider this information and that would allow time for workers who are driving to be able to find a place to safely stop and review this information and make an informed decision.,122,,
932,0.97,7045.938,7079.238,"There would be a best estimate of engaged time and mileage, the guaranteed amount of payment, locations of work, physical requirements of work such as flights of stairs and contents of unsealed projects, especially when handling those type of projects could pose a health risk.",122,,
933,0.97,7079.238,7090.183,So this would be advanced notice of that situation.,122,,
934,0.97,7090.183,7105.531,Worker might decide to decline the kind of offer Oh B maybe accept it if there are some ways to Acceptably mitigate that brisk such as a sealed container.,122,,
935,0.97,7105.531,7112.271,The next part of transparency is information for the worker and customer and public at large.,122,,
936,0.97,7112.271,7119.045,Electronic receipts within 24 hours of each completed offer or cancelled offer with cause.,122,,
937,0.97,7119.045,7139.532,This particular requirement Aligns with the TNC driver minimum compensation that has a similar requirement for all workers customers and third party businesses.,122,,
938,0.97,7139.665,7160.586,[Indiscernible] in is a right to have an Itemed pay statement and a right to have advanced notices before changes to their pay.,122,,
939,0.97,7160.586,7164.657,This would Replicate a lot of that.,122,,
940,0.97,7164.657,7184.577,Then last public disclosure of data on worker earnings and work perform and that would be something that the companies would be expected to perform for the public to be able to access on their own.,122,,
941,0.97,7184.577,7210.203,The next policy is regarding flexibility and what a lot of--what we hear from workers is that one of the reasons that at based work is so valued is for the amount of independence that it can offer workers and so this next proposal would seek to legislate the ability to maintain that independence and Perp form the work at the same time.,122,,
942,0.97,7210.203,7245.838,"So there would be a list of rights that workers would have to maintain the fleck to believe the log into the platform on specific dates without restriction, no restriction on the amounts of time to be logged in, no adverse action base odd on availability, the right to accept or reject any individual offer which is a key right to generated a fair amount of stake holder discussion t right to cancel an offer with cause a ledge isolation would itemize would rise to the level of cause.",122,,
943,0.97,7245.838,7255.414,No restriction on working for other companies including self employment and then limits on monitoring in the interest of the company.,122,,
944,0.97,7255.414,7262.622,That is a quick Summery of the flexibility.,122,,
945,0.97,7262.622,7263.022,Next deactivation.,122,,
946,0.97,7263.022,7268.561,This will be the last topic that is part of today's presentation.,122,,
947,0.97,7268.561,7288.514,This proposal would seek to protect a worker's right to access work and jobs and prohibiting work to deactivation and also setting up a procedure for workers to challenge deactivation in a Timeline to get them information and to challenge that.,122,,
948,0.97,7288.514,7295.154,To begin the legislation would establish a list of unwarranted reasons for deactivation.,122,,
949,0.97,7295.154,7308.167,Could be up to 14 or so reasons and it would be established immediately I believe for the TNC driver deactivation that the office of labor standards established that list.,122,,
950,0.97,7308.167,7311.337,This legislation would do that on the front end.,122,,
951,0.97,7311.337,7327.953,"Companies would be expected to post an exhaustive list of their warranted reasons for deactivation for the public and for workers to know before they took a job, started working with the company and for that to be updated throughout the duration of their work.",122,,
952,0.97,7327.953,7349.208,"For any deactivation a company would be required to provide 14 day advanced notice of impending deactivation including the reasons for the deactivation, same as for the TNC driver de deactivation right.",122,,
953,0.97,7349.208,7367.426,Then once a worker received notice of an impending deactivation the worker would have a right to request company records that could--that were relevant to that decision and have a right to receive those records within seven days of the request.,122,,
954,0.97,7367.426,7383.609,So then proposal would establish a Timeline for challenging the deactivation along with the company's response to that challenge.,122,,
955,0.97,7383.609,7397.056,Workers could challenge the deactivation within 90 days of the effective date of the deactivation or 90 days of the last time they attempt to use the platform.,122,,
956,0.97,7397.056,7418.21,Within 14 days the company would provide--what is termed as satisfactory justification for that decision and satisfactory justification would be evident rare sub assistant--[Indiscernible] and then responses to any of the worker's questions or claim challenging the deactivation.,122,,
957,0.97,7418.21,7439.231,The company could provide a statement of reasonable cause to extend that Timeline but would only go so far because the worker would have a right if the company did not provide it.,122,,
958,0.97,7439.231,7449.175,Another situation where the worker could receive the Reenstatementment would be if the company did not comply.,122,,
959,0.97,7449.175,7457.283,This Timeline would be enforced by the office of labor standards.,122,,
960,0.97,7457.583,7463.422,Company did not comply.,122,,
961,0.97,7464.089,7465.324,This Timeline would be enforced by the office of labor standards.,122,,
962,0.97,7465.624,7482.041,This was very different from the driver rights and in that its this proposal focuses on Timeline and procedure.,122,,
963,0.97,7482.041,7494.887,So what office of labor standard be enforcing is whether or not the Timeline and procedures were followed and whether or not the company provided satisfactory justification for the deactivation.,122,,
964,0.97,7494.887,7501.06,They would not be expected to adjudicate the substance of worker claims.,122,,
965,0.97,7501.06,7507.199,There was some stake holder feedback on this proposal as with others.,122,,
966,0.97,7507.199,7512.037,That is the end of the over view of the policy proposal thus far.,122,,
967,0.97,7512.037,7537.363,"In the future beginning this afternoon there will be discussion of background checks, fair chance to access the platform and then later access to Restrooms, civil rights protections, the establishment of an advisory board and then last enforcement and other aspects of implementation.",122,,
968,0.97,7537.363,7539.031,Are there any questions?,122,,
969,0.97,7539.031,7545.404,Really appreciate the over view.,123,,
970,0.97,7545.404,7545.804,Thank you so much.,123,,
971,0.97,7545.804,7565.424,I want to thank the staff for participating in the stake holder meetings every week as well as staff from Council member Strauss and Lewis' office.,123,,
972,0.97,7565.424,7574.733,We are--today's over view was focussed on a particular proposal.,123,,
973,0.97,7574.733,7588.814,Many of the comments that are contained in the presentation that she just went over reflect a different perspective on working Washington's proposal.,123,,
974,0.97,7588.814,7597.456,I encourage folks to take a look at those.,123,,
975,0.97,7597.456,7607.433,Really appreciate--engagement because he has actually put ideas on the table which I think is really useful for this discussion.,123,,
976,0.97,7607.433,7618.711,So we can really push up our sleeves and look at the different approaches and the different philosophies under pinning those approaches.,123,,
977,0.97,7618.711,7625.718,So again I will update everybody's time.,123,,
978,0.97,7625.718,7626.018,Thank you.,123,,
979,0.97,7626.018,7631.256,"Alex, you want to read the last it please?",123,,
980,0.97,7631.256,7635.928,Committee number 3.,124,,
981,0.97,7635.928,7642.501,An ordinance relating to the Seattle police Department.,124,,
982,0.97,7642.501,7651.644,Thank you.,124,,
983,0.97,7651.644,7664.256,Before I hand it off want to just--Lisa will briefly summarize the legislation she presented on January 22nd and then we will talk about the amendment before us.,124,,
984,0.97,7664.256,7683.842,"Just a quick Recap, legislation and follow the engagement with the U.S. Department of justice and the monitor that engagement has been an informal engagement that is separate from the process that is laid out in the consent decree.",124,,
985,0.97,7683.842,7695.187,The legislation builds off of the legislation originally entered the spike.,124,,
986,0.97,7695.187,7704.229,"It includes the subsequent recommendation from the accountability bodies, the Oig, the CPC and the OPA.",124,,
987,0.97,7704.229,7712.304,Again it incorporates the feedback that we have received informally from the Department and the monitor.,124,,
988,0.97,7712.304,7725.451,"Since February 9th and acted on by committee or design to address the issues, identified by both DOJ and various core decisions.",124,,
989,0.97,7725.451,7739.898,Just--again for the viewing public the law that I Referenced that we pass unanimously in June the DOJ sought a restraining order against that legislation.,124,,
990,0.97,7739.898,7746.705,The judge granted that restraining order so we have no regulation in place at this point.,124,,
991,0.97,7746.705,7754.546,"Back in August of last year we received recommendation from the CPC, the Oig and the OPA.",124,,
992,0.97,7754.546,7763.422,They have been presented in Committee in September.,124,,
993,0.97,7763.422,7779.571,In January and February the committee discussed a drafted bill based on the recommendation of the accountability bodies and then since then we have incorporated feedback from DOJ and the monitor.,124,,
994,0.97,7779.571,7787.479,With that I--I'm recognizing that we are coming up on a year of working on--[Indiscernible] of the bill.,124,,
995,0.97,7787.479,7797.923,My goal is to adopt the strongest legislation possible with in the context of the consent decree.,124,,
996,0.97,7797.923,7799.925,With that I will pass it off to Lisa.,124,,
997,0.97,7799.925,7816.441,I will have some closing remarks about the process going forward because there has been concern that there has been information that has muddied the process moving forward.,124,,
998,0.97,7816.441,7816.942,Thank you.,124,,
999,0.97,7816.942,7828.887,I will share my screen and then walk through a Recap of the bill.,125,,
1000,0.97,7828.887,7831.757,Does that show up for you?,125,,
1001,0.97,7831.757,7834.626,Are you seeing it?,126,,
1002,0.97,7834.626,7835.127,Yes.,127,,
1003,0.97,7835.127,7837.629,Great.,128,,
1004,0.97,7837.629,7837.863,Okay.,128,,
1005,0.97,7837.863,7846.572,So I would direct them it is on page 76 of the agenda packet.,128,,
1006,0.97,7846.572,7853.812,It is the same staff memo as presented at the June 21st committee meeting.,128,,
1007,0.97,7853.812,7855.547,The table is attached to the staff memo.,128,,
1008,0.97,7855.547,7863.222,It is on page 79 of the agenda packet.,128,,
1009,0.97,7863.222,7873.232,So starting with the second line of the table Council bill 120105 which son page 66 would ban five types of less lethal weapons.,128,,
1010,0.97,7873.232,7875.868,Same as in the February draft.,128,,
1011,0.97,7875.868,7887.88,"Those five types are acoustic weapons, directed energy weapons, Disorientation devices including blast balls, ultra sonic Cannons and water Cannons.",128,,
1012,0.97,7887.88,7899.358,"Moving to the third line, section 1D of the ordinance before you today are pertains to noise flash diversion nary devices.",128,,
1013,0.97,7899.491,7918.844,[Indiscernible] that is the risk of harm from violent actions must out weigh the risk to bystanders.,128,,
1014,0.97,7918.844,7920.312,Moving to the fourth line.,128,,
1015,0.97,7920.312,7937.362,Section 1E of the ordinance would restrict the use--they would be allowed only for use by Swat officers and only when the risk test is met.,128,,
1016,0.97,7937.362,7949.975,Subject to those two conditions the use of those 40 millimeter launchers would be allowed outside demonstration or rally or in a demolition or rally for purposes other than crowd control.,128,,
1017,0.97,7949.975,7956.915,So those would include things such as intervening with small groups engaged in dangerous or illegal activity.,128,,
1018,0.97,7956.915,7987.079,"I want to add here as it relates, this is one of the change that was made in the most recent bill and it was intended to recognize that the launchers that launch pepper balls have just recently as in February their use and the use of force policies associated with them were just approved by the course.",129,,
1019,0.97,7987.079,8002.294,So--recognizing that that puts this attended regulation in--a position where we would be basically be asking the judge to undo the policy he just approved.,129,,
1020,0.97,8002.294,8012.07,It seemed more appropriate to make--to--take that issue off the table since it has already been addressed.,129,,
1021,0.97,8012.07,8017.509,It is further clarified by the amendment you are bringing forward today also.,130,,
1022,0.97,8017.509,8028.186,"So moving to the fifth line of the table before you, the summarize of section 1F of the Council bill which restricts the use of pepper spray.",130,,
1023,0.97,8028.186,8034.292,So pepper spray could be used in the following circumstances of but only when the risk test is met.,130,,
1024,0.97,8034.292,8040.298,That is the risk of serious bodily injury must out weigh the risk of harm to bystanders.,130,,
1025,0.97,8040.298,8059.351,"The following circumstances in which it would be allowed as long as that risk condition is met are outside of a demonstration or rally, during a demonstration or rally but for purposes other than crowd control or for crowd control during a violent public disturbance at a demonstration or rally.",130,,
1026,0.97,8059.351,8067.292,"Moving to the last line, this is tear gas.",130,,
1027,0.97,8067.292,8070.695,Swat officers would be used to use if two conditions are met.,130,,
1028,0.97,8070.695,8085.41,First the use must be reasonably necessary to prevent the threat of imminent loss of life or serious injury and the risk of serious bodily injury from violent Oh actions must out weigh the risk of harm to bystanders.,130,,
1029,0.97,8085.41,8094.686,The bill also authorizes the use of tear gas at a demonstration or a rally but only if all five conditions are met.,130,,
1030,0.97,8094.686,8101.426,The first four were included in the February draft.,130,,
1031,0.97,8101.426,8103.328,The fifth adds a second risk test.,130,,
1032,0.97,8103.328,8111.603,So the five conditions that have to be met to be able to use tear gas at demonstration or rally are first it must be during a violent public disturbance.,130,,
1033,0.97,8111.603,8116.041,It must be at the direction of and by recently trained officers.,130,,
1034,0.97,8116.041,8123.381,So both the people--the officers providing the direction and the officers deploying the tear gas have to have been recently trained.,130,,
1035,0.97,8123.381,8128.32,It must be deployed with a detailed tactical plan.,130,,
1036,0.97,8128.32,8147.839,Then it has these two additional conditions that the use must be reasonably necessary to prevent the imminent threat of loss--pardon me to prevent threat of imminent loss of life or serious injury.,130,,
1037,0.97,8147.839,8149.04,That summarizes the table before you.,130,,
1038,0.97,8149.04,8160.652,"I can summarize the rest of the bill if you wish, council member or we can move to the amendments.",130,,
1039,0.97,8160.652,8177.202,This is a refresher but--[Indiscernible] unless there are specific questions I think it would be great if we could move into the discussion of the amendments.,131,,
1040,0.97,8177.202,8186.912,"With--before we go into the discussion I think, sorry, you are presenting what the contents of the amendments would be great.",131,,
1041,0.97,8186.912,8187.212,Okay.,132,,
1042,0.97,8187.212,8197.789,I will walk through the three amendments briefly and then I am assuming each the sponsors would speak to the amendment,132,,
1043,0.97,8197.789,8198.456,Correct.,133,,
1044,0.97,8198.456,8198.79,Okay.,134,,
1045,0.97,8198.79,8223.014,So the first two amendments would modify section 1H of the Council bill that establish as private right of action and before I--summarize these two let me note that questions about a private right of action that have been raised during public comment today and previously raise complex legal issues and I would suggest the city attorney respond to Council members on any of those questions.,134,,
1046,0.97,8223.014,8225.317,They are not questions I can speak to.,134,,
1047,0.97,8225.317,8227.218,I'm not an attorney.,134,,
1048,0.97,8227.218,8230.722,They need to be discussed in executive session.,134,,
1049,0.97,8230.722,8243.235,So the amendment 1 that you see before you is sponsored by Council member Sawant.,134,,
1050,0.97,8243.235,8255.347,-- and also would be available to a person who in the judgment of a reasonable person commit add criminal offense at or immediately prior to the use of less lethal force.,134,,
1051,0.97,8255.347,8259.517,Amendment 2 is sponsored by Council policemen better Herbold.,134,,
1052,0.97,8259.517,8262.02,It also speaks to the private right of action.,134,,
1053,0.97,8262.02,8274.132,I would make the right of private action available to persons impacted by the police violating provisions of this Council bill at anytime including during a violent public disturbance.,134,,
1054,0.97,8274.132,8284.342,This amendment retains this restriction on the person who may have committed a criminal offense.,134,,
1055,0.97,8284.342,8290.649,Finally the third amendment before you today is sponsored by Council member Herbold.,134,,
1056,0.97,8290.649,8297.422,This clarifies the restrictions would apply to the deployment of pepper balls regardless to the caliber of the launchers.,134,,
1057,0.97,8297.422,8311.936,Previously the language was restricted to only 40 millimeter launchers and pepper balls may be deployed by a different kind of launcher.,134,,
1058,0.97,8311.936,8312.604,That COMPLETES my Summery.,134,,
1059,0.97,8312.604,8313.138,Thank you.,135,,
1060,0.97,8313.138,8328.92,Before we get into the amendments I need to get the--legislation in front of us.,135,,
1061,0.97,8328.92,8330.689,Thank you.,135,,
1062,0.97,8330.689,8334.025,I move adoption of Council bill 120105.,135,,
1063,0.97,8334.025,8334.826,Second.,135,,
1064,0.97,8334.826,8335.093,Second.,136,,
1065,0.97,8335.093,8335.393,Second.,137,,
1066,0.97,8335.393,8337.028,Thank you.,138,,
1067,0.97,8337.028,8338.029,Thank you so much.,138,,
1068,0.97,8338.029,8342.6,We now have the bill in front of us.,138,,
1069,0.97,8342.6,8350.041,We can move on to a discussion and vote on each of the three amendments.,138,,
1070,0.97,8350.041,8362.42,Thank you for Lisa for your--your description of those amendments and I think what we will do is get each of the amendments individually in front of us and invite a discussion after the fact.,138,,
1071,0.97,8362.42,8370.895,With that Enquiring whether or not there is a motion for amendment 1?,138,,
1072,0.97,8370.895,8375.233,I move amendment 1.,139,,
1073,0.97,8375.233,8377.202,Thank you.,140,,
1074,0.97,8377.202,8378.803,Is there a second?,140,,
1075,0.97,8378.803,8381.072,Can I get a second to discuss Snit.,141,,
1076,0.97,8381.072,8386.578,I will give you a second for discussion.,142,,
1077,0.97,8386.578,8388.279,Thank you.,143,,
1078,0.97,8388.279,8394.986,Council Herbold said we want the strongest possible legislation to go into effect.,143,,
1079,0.97,8394.986,8395.42,I completely agree.,143,,
1080,0.97,8395.42,8412.537,Unfortunately the draft bill that is in question today and I will speak to the amendment in a second actually creates two glaring loopholes.,143,,
1081,0.97,8412.537,8423.581,Lets remember the ban on crowd control weapons was last year in the midst of the height of the black lives matter protests.,143,,
1082,0.97,8423.581,8435.727,With--real massive coordinated action by black lives matter protesters and our Socialist Council office and these loopholes go beyond all the loopholes allowing the police to use many crowd control weapons.,143,,
1083,0.97,8435.727,8447.238,In other words these loopholes make so it in many cases enforcement is not possible even when the police flagrantly break the law.,143,,
1084,0.97,8447.238,8458.683,"So often politicians ring their hands and lament how difficult it is to hold police accountable when there are outrageous exams of police brutality that make the news, loop Hoels like these are why this happens.",143,,
1085,0.97,8458.683,8465.123,This sort loophole is why it is so difficult to hold the police accountable.,143,,
1086,0.97,8465.123,8469.494,The first loophole is what I could call label the protest violent loophole.,143,,
1087,0.97,8469.794,8549.741,"Council members talk at length about how many of these weapons are still restricted such as the Undefineable restriction that there has Oh to be a genuine threat to people's safety, the police do not use the weapon but that is meaningless because none of those restrictions are included in the enforcement section.",143,,
1088,0.97,8549.741,8557.148,The second loophole is the frame the victim loophole.,143,,
1089,0.97,8557.148,8579.17,"If the police flagrantly and illegally use every banned weapon from blast balls to a Microwave gun against a totally peaceful protest, then arrest people to not abiding by the Curfew, there can be no en enforcement.",143,,
1090,0.97,8579.17,8600.325,Almost 100% of the people had committed the criminal offense of violating Curfew so the enforcement section could never have been used no matter how brutal the police were if this legislation and the loophole were in place.,143,,
1091,0.97,8600.325,8611.502,This loophole would cause the police to arrest more peace professional Testers for these called crimes that are really a catch all for any protest.,143,,
1092,0.97,8611.803,8621.546,Ful protestors for these called crimes that are really a catch all for any protest.,143,,
1093,0.97,8621.846,8645.169,"Either the use of the crowd control weapons is legal or it isn't and if it is illegal, excessive force then the enforcement should count regardless of the victim.",143,,
1094,0.97,8645.169,8648.406,Amendment 1 which I'm proposing makes the enforcement very simple.,143,,
1095,0.97,8648.406,8663.221,"The police break the law the enforcement applies, if they don't, it doesn't.",143,,
1096,0.97,8663.221,8681.272,I know Council member Herbold has an amendment that will come up next that will only close one of these two loop loopholes.,143,,
1097,0.97,8681.272,8717.375,"If this amendment closing both the loopholes fails, I will of course be voting for that other amendment and that--note that amendment exists because this amendment exists because it looks like I'm predicting most Council members or all Council members will be voting no on and it is a Testament to the mass pressure they are under because of all the promises that they made last year in the thick of the protest and then one by one those promises were walked back.",143,,
1098,0.97,8717.375,8729.454,"If the second amendment passes and this amendment fails, that is still a really important Vartal victory that would be an important victory.",143,,
1099,0.97,8729.754,8738.162,Thank you.,143,,
1100,0.97,8750.575,8752.577,"Thank you, council member.",144,,
1101,0.97,8752.577,8768.025,Really appreciate your explanation of your amendment including the part of the explanation that--does a good job of describing my amendment.,144,,
1102,0.97,8768.025,8768.459,Thank you for that.,144,,
1103,0.97,8768.459,8769.56,Council member Morales.,144,,
1104,0.97,8769.56,8775.833,I have to be on the phone day so--it is always tricky.,145,,
1105,0.97,8775.833,8782.073,I have a--some questions but I wanted to understand our process here first Madam chair.,145,,
1106,0.97,8782.073,8786.477,Are we going to bring up all three amendments or are we doing this one at time?,145,,
1107,0.97,8786.477,8790.181,We are doing one at time.,146,,
1108,0.97,8790.181,8791.182,Okay.,147,,
1109,0.97,8791.182,8804.195,"So, so I will say in general that I--agree with what Council member Sawant is saying about what the two separate issues here.",147,,
1110,0.97,8804.195,8820.845,"It seems to me that--um--if there is a use of force violation from an officer, it shouldn't make a difference whether or not the person is perceived to have committed a crime first.",147,,
1111,0.97,8820.845,8826.117,I am certainly not an attorney so I am just trying to think this through.,147,,
1112,0.97,8826.117,8837.461,It seems that--a--someone should not lose their right to private action even before they have been convicted of a crime.,147,,
1113,0.97,8837.461,8849.106,This--the way it is written now seems to me to indicate that the person would not have received due process before being denied their right.,147,,
1114,0.97,8849.106,8855.78,I don't see how an officer is on solved of violating policy because somebody may have committed an offense.,147,,
1115,0.97,8855.78,8871.295,"Those seem like separate things to me so--so, that is one issue and then my second question is I am interested in hearing a little bit more discussion among Council members about the issue of a private right of action all together.",147,,
1116,0.97,8871.596,8881.772,You know.,148,,
1117,0.97,8911.769,8913.938,Thank you.,149,,
1118,0.97,8913.938,8918.309,"Yeah, I appreciate that Councilman Morales.",150,,
1119,0.97,8918.309,8918.876,"Councilmember, Gonzalez?",151,,
1120,0.97,8918.876,8935.159,"I will speak on this issue, not relying on the city attorney's office, but on my own experience, as a civil rights attorney who spent years representing people in these types of cases, and there's a couple of things that are, I think important for us to keep in mind as Council members.",152,,
1121,0.97,8935.159,8954.445,One is that a private cause of action for folks who have experienced use of force exists under the U.S. Constitution and Washington state Constitution regardless of what is in this particular bill.,152,,
1122,0.97,8954.445,8965.69,"I'm hearing a lot of insinuation that a private cause of action will not exist unless this bill passes, and that's just simply inaccurate.",152,,
1123,0.97,8965.69,9042.933,"I have filed plenty of use of force bills related to crowd control, weapons, and Lastly the weapons in my practice here in Seattle long before today, so just to be really clear, the right of action for members of the public continues to exist, and it's also true that in many of the cases, in which I represented the individuals who were subjected to excessive force, there were allegations and investigations of potential criminal conduct of a victim of excessive force in those cases, and there is a body of law that exists under Federal and state law that is referred to as collateral Gastopale that if the individual was convicted of the crime in that incident, there would be a significant barrier to overcome to be able to successfully file a private cause of action in a court of law, and in most instances would result in the complete dismissal of the civil rights case if the individual was, in fact, convicted of a crime.",152,,
1124,0.97,9042.933,9047.872,That occurred either during or before the use of force incident.,152,,
1125,0.97,9047.872,9107.198,"So I offer that to you all, colleagues, as we are having the conversation about this incredibly legal component of the bill because I think it's important to acknowledge that victims of force do face barriers in the courts of law in instances when there's been a conviction of a crime or in some instances, the allegations can come in, but I don't think that the mere allegations of the potential crime at the scene would you know, Disqualifien in from bringing action.",152,,
1126,0.97,9107.198,9124.215,I'm struggling because there does not seem to be acknowledging the difference between a conviction of a crime or mere suspicion or thought of a crime that may have occurred during the scene.,152,,
1127,0.97,9124.215,9137.428,"I just want to add that for additional context that probably muddies the waters more, but the thinking around Councilmember Morales' thinking.",152,,
1128,0.97,9137.428,9147.671,And that's sort of my frame of mind on evaluating proposed amendment one and two.,152,,
1129,0.97,9147.671,9152.076,Thank you.,153,,
1130,0.97,9152.076,9173.097,"Telling us that you're speaking from your personal experience and giving us the benefit of your legal wisdom, otherwise I would have just suggested that folks review the Attorney- client privilege information sent at 8:30 this morning for the amendment.",153,,
1131,0.97,9173.097,9185.342,"One thing I would add, not just that people can currently without the law file suits.",153,,
1132,0.97,9185.342,9209.3,"Not only can they, they are, right now for the events associated, and the fact that the language does not exist does not impact their ability to file these causes of action for negligence.",153,,
1133,0.97,9209.3,9253.31,"I do want to share, just for people's recollections the language proposed to be inserted is language we previously struck from the legislation because of our review and understanding of the city attorney's advice in this area, and they have previously advised us on what the impact of the amendment would be, and we had decided to strike language in the proposed amendment, and then decided to Reinsert it.",153,,
1134,0.97,9253.31,9255.212,Actually the other way around.,153,,
1135,0.97,9255.212,9267.791,"We added the language in the proposed amendment, suggesting that we Delete the language that we had already decided to add.",153,,
1136,0.97,9267.791,9268.826,So there are no further questions.,153,,
1137,0.97,9277.201,9283.273,I would like to call amendment four for the vote.,153,,
1138,0.97,9283.273,9283.574,--,154,,
1139,0.97,9283.574,9283.874,Your.,155,,
1140,0.97,9283.874,9287.211,You didn't give me a chance to respond to the points.,156,,
1141,0.97,9287.211,9289.079,I didn't see your hand raised.,157,,
1142,0.97,9289.079,9293.851,I didn't raise my hand because I assumed you would let me close out.,158,,
1143,0.97,9293.851,9294.785,The floor is yours.,159,,
1144,0.97,9294.785,9303.26,"I don't agree with the comments that have been made, you know, yes, that is a--the state Constitution has that right.",160,,
1145,0.97,9303.26,9306.997,You don't have to be an attorney to know that.,160,,
1146,0.97,9306.997,9347.738,"Yes, people know that, and as a matter of fact, the hundreds of people who have spoken in public comment on this issue and on the bill as a whole, on attempts to undermine the weapons ban that our movement was able to win last summer, and as you, yourself, have reminded us correctly, chair, it was passed by the Council, but it clearly shows what a mass pressure the movements play and the establishment last summer, everyone was forced to vote yes.",160,,
1147,0.97,9347.738,9354.445,"The movement subsided, and there's systematic attempts to undermine the victories that people have won.",160,,
1148,0.97,9354.445,9395.586,"I wanted to point out, yes, we all know that is the right that exists on the books, and the people, and at the same time, the people who have spoken, hundreds of people who spoke in public comment throughout the year, starting in January and even before that, they are absolutely correct, to be fighting for the private right of action in this bill, as well, and Council members should know, my office did not--we have really--we have really helped people to understand what this undermining of the bill really contributes, what the specific features are happening, and why we are fighting for the private right of action.",160,,
1149,0.97,9395.586,9413.103,"The fact is that hundreds of people have reached this conclusion on their own that we absolutely need this in this bill, regardless of what the state Constitution says because they understand, correctly, on their own, not because I coached them.",160,,
1150,0.97,9413.103,9431.989,"They understand on their own that as chair Gonzalez acknowledged, there's significant barriers in the criminal justice system for ordinary people, much less people of color and immigrant people and poor people.",160,,
1151,0.97,9431.989,9436.26,"It's extremely hard, if not impossible, to get justice in the criminal world.",160,,
1152,0.97,9436.26,9446.103,"If you acknowledge that, and that's why hundreds are fight, for the private right of action in this bill, why would you not go out of your way to remove the barriers.",160,,
1153,0.97,9446.103,9454.812,"Why would you put in place barriers when you know, and by your own acknowledgement, there's significant barriers to Etry.",160,,
1154,0.97,9454.812,9463.821,"Based on what you are all saying, thousands of people in Seattle should be paying for what the Mayor and the police Department did under the Mayor's supervision last summer.",160,,
1155,0.97,9463.821,9469.259,Show me how many people have gotten any kind of Addressment from the codes.,160,,
1156,0.97,9469.259,9475.699,"In other words, I don't believe that any additional law is, by itself, going to be appropriate.",160,,
1157,0.97,9475.699,9479.636,That's not why we are not fighting for the private right of action in this bill.,160,,
1158,0.97,9479.636,9493.417,"We are fighting for the private right of action in this bill because we need to do everything in our power, my office believes as elected representatives, we need to everything in our power to make it easier, not more difficult for people.",160,,
1159,0.97,9493.417,9518.942,"I also believe, of course, that at the end of the day, as we have shown, and from recent history, there's no substitute for mass movements and democratically organized movements because no single legislation is going to do that, and Furthermore, to win the victories, it takes that action.",160,,
1160,0.97,9518.942,9526.049,"If police break the law, enforcement should be in action, period.",160,,
1161,0.97,9526.049,9528.085,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,161,,
1162,0.97,9528.085,9532.189,Will the clerk please call the role on the amendment?,161,,
1163,0.97,9532.189,9533.79,Gonzalez.,162,,
1164,0.97,9533.79,9536.66,No.,163,,

1173,0.97,9554.411,9554.945,Move on amendment two.,172,,
1174,0.97,9554.945,9555.345,Is there a second?,172,,
1175,0.97,9565.389,9567.357,Second.,173,,
1176,0.97,9567.591,9567.925,Thank you.,174,,
1177,0.97,9567.925,9608.599,"Council member Sawant did a great job of describing amendment two because this does address one of the issues that her amendment intended to address, making the private right of action available to persons impacted by police violating provisions in the Council at any time, including during violent public disturbance, and this amendment brings the private right of action provision in line with the rest of the revised bill, achieves consistency, and again, for the viewing public, the term of violent public disturbance is not something that officers can say exists.",174,,
1178,0.97,9608.599,9614.905,We also have a definition for what a violent public disturbance is.,174,,
1179,0.97,9614.905,9634.358,If an officer thinks something is a violent public disturbance for the justification for--that is a violation of policy that could be a basis for discipline.,174,,
1180,0.97,9637.06,9644.001,Is there--are there any Councilmember Morales.,174,,
1181,0.97,9644.001,9645.736,I see your hand.,175,,
1182,0.97,9645.736,9650.273,This is a Followup to the comments made during number one.,176,,
1183,0.97,9650.273,9658.915,I am going to--I am generally supportive of proposed amendment two.,176,,
1184,0.97,9658.915,9671.161,"However, I do think that there is some strengthening that could happen in the last sentence, consistent with the statements of what I made in context of amendment one.",176,,
1185,0.97,9671.161,9722.579,"I would like to abstain today with the hope that I can work with you, as the chair to make a small modification to the second sentence that would clarify that last intent to indicate that what we are looking for is something that is a higher standard, in other words, if a person is convicted of a criminal offense, that occurred at or immediately prior to the use of less lethal force, I would be interested in exploring it that change with you with the advice of our law Department as well, but I am a little nervous about how to evaluate the standard as it currently exists.",176,,
1186,0.97,9722.579,9733.757,In the judgment of a reasonable person commits a criminal offense at or immediately prior to the use of less lethal force.,176,,
1187,0.97,9733.757,9752.976,I'm hoping we have a conversation if it would make greater sense to change to a person who was convicted by a legal fact finder of actually having committed a criminal offense at or immediately prior to the use of less lethal force.,176,,
1188,0.97,9752.976,9774.764,"That would make, I think that would make this particular amendment a little stronger in my mind, but again, I'm generally supportive of this amendment, and Certainy I don't want to hold it up in committee today because I think that's something that use can I can discuss and hopefully thread the needle on.",176,,
1189,0.97,9774.764,9775.999,Thank you so much.,177,,
1190,0.97,9775.999,9783.173,"I was going to say this for the end, but I think it's appropriate to share now.",177,,
1191,0.97,9783.173,9807.497,"As it relates to the full council consideration of this, since there is an announced status conference to the parties of the decent decree on August 10th in recognition of this, I'm proposing the full council not vote until after that date, which would be August 16th.",177,,
1192,0.97,9807.497,9814.037,That would give us some more time to create some additive language to the amendment.,177,,
1193,0.97,9814.538,9819.209,"Perfect, thank you, chair.",178,,
1194,0.97,9819.209,9823.213,I appreciate it.,178,,

1197,0.97,9827.217,9831.288,I have spoken to this.,181,,
1198,0.97,9831.288,9840.33,I want to inform the public I will be voting yes to close one of the two blaring loopholes in the lesson.,181,,

1212,0.97,9870.56,9870.827,Passes.,194,,
1213,0.97,9870.827,9881.972,Is there a second on amendment three?,195,,
1214,0.97,9881.972,9882.305,Second.,196,,
1215,0.97,9882.305,9883.206,Thank you Council President Gonzalez.,197,,
1216,0.97,9883.206,9898.455,"The third amendment as central staff explained, it's to clarify the restrictions in section 1E that it applies to the deployment of Pepperballs regardless of the caliber of the launcher, 0.40-Millimeter or otherwise.",197,,
1217,0.97,9898.455,9946.836,"It's largely a technical clarification, and I also want to highlight that you all received a letter from the community police Commission that really highlights their long concern around less Lethals, and they are supportive around this piece of legislation in recognition that it does not incorporate all of their recommendations, but that they recognize it does work towards implementing some of the recommendations, and they are engaged in ongoing conversations around policy changes in this area.",197,,
1218,0.97,9946.836,9959.549,"So, again, looking to see if there are questions or comments about this bill or this amendment.",197,,
1219,0.97,9959.549,9960.016,Councilmember Sawant?,197,,
1220,0.97,9960.016,9960.85,Thank you.,198,,
1221,0.97,9960.85,9967.524,As far as I know the CPC letter does not say anything about this amendment.,198,,
1222,0.97,9967.524,9974.998,I do think it is problematic to cite the CPC letter overall as a reason to support the legislation.,198,,
1223,0.97,9974.998,10005.428,"It's accurate they are calling for a Yes vote, but they are clearly in their letter settling for something totally inadequate saying, quote, this legislation does work towards implementation to some recommendations made by the CPC letter last fall, however they identified additional changes necessary to best protect the public safety for which we ask the city Council to not stop striving.",198,,
1224,0.97,10005.428,10005.729,End quote.,198,,
1225,0.97,10005.729,10008.898,"In other words, this means it's not adequate.",198,,
1226,0.97,10008.898,10015.772,"As far as this amendment goes, I do not believe the CPC letter weighed in on it in any way.",198,,
1227,0.97,10015.772,10029.419,"I will be voting no on it because it increases the type of guns shooting chemical weapons that the police can use against protesters, which I do not support.",198,,
1228,0.97,10029.419,10037.327,"Just to clarify, I did say that much of what you said, Councilmember Sawant myself.",199,,
1229,0.97,10037.327,10049.039,"I said that the CPC letter while it supports the legislation, acknowledges it only works towards implementing some of the recommendations, and there's more work to be done.",199,,
1230,0.97,10049.039,10054.811,Thank you for underscoring what I previously said.,199,,
1231,0.97,10054.811,10077.167,"The amendment relates to a regulation on the deployment of Pepperballs, and there has been a concern that without the amendment that we will not regulate the use of Pepperballs if it is in something other than a 0.45-Millimeter launcher.",199,,
1232,0.97,10077.167,10080.236,"If it's in a different launcher, it's unregulated.",199,,
1233,0.97,10080.236,10086.276,I want to clarify the statement that you don't support the amendment and Whatnot supporting the amendment would mean.,199,,
1234,0.97,10094.184,10096.92,If you and--chair Herbold.,199,,
1235,0.97,10096.92,10109.399,"That means that if they acquired launchers larger or smaller than 48 Millimeters without the amendment, they would be able to use this ammunition?",200,,
1236,0.97,10109.399,10109.866,That's correct.,201,,
1237,0.97,10109.866,10110.133,Okay.,202,,
1238,0.97,10110.133,10110.433,Thank you.,203,,
1239,0.97,10114.137,10119.209,"All right, if there's no further --",204,,
1240,0.97,10119.209,10119.542,Question.,205,,
1241,0.97,10119.542,10119.809,Sorry.,206,,
1242,0.97,10119.809,10120.176,No problem.,207,,
1243,0.97,10120.176,10122.779,I raised my hand again.,208,,
1244,0.97,10122.779,10130.32,I wanted to confirm with Lisa what you just said because that was not my understanding.,208,,

1264,0.97,10196.886,10205.828,"Great, returning to the main motion, and again I want to note that my intent in making the emotion to vote on the legislation is it will be sent to full Council, to be scheduled for vote after the upcoming status conference scheduled for August 10th.",221,,
1265,0.97,10205.828,10207.697,The first potential date would be August 16th.,221,,

1273,0.97,10286.909,10301.591,"Within struggles there are always questions about when to accept something insufficient and when to hold out to win more, and it's inaccurate to suggest that this bill represents what the movement has advocated for.",224,,
1274,0.97,10301.591,10336.125,"The legislation my office proposed that passed last fall represents that, and I believe that the city council should hold out to fight for the legislation going into effect rather than passing this bill creating loopholes to the extend that the conversation has advanced so dramatically since last year, and the pressure that exists on the Democratic establishments in city after city, showing results for the promises that were made last year during the protests, and I think all of this shows that protests and mass movements do work.",224,,
1275,0.97,10336.125,10371.861,"The problem is when they subside, you see all of the real positions of politicians coming out, and that is why I would want to urge all of the hundreds of people, maybe even thousands of people who have engaged on this issue, specifically, this year, fighting to hold on to most, if not everything that we had won last year, I wanted to thank them and congratulate them for their persistence and courage, and also urge them to understand that the fight is far from done, and we have to keep organizing and keep organizing.",224,,
