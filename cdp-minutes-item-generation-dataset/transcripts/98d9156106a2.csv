19,0.97,87.42,99.966,It is 9:33 am and this is a regularly scheduled meeting of the Council at our Council briefing.,4,,
20,0.97,99.966,105.071,"Cancel members, the Council rules are silent on allowing electronic participation accounts of briefing meetings.",4,,
21,0.97,105.071,116.683,"In order for us to continue participating remotely, I'm going to move to suspend the Council rules through March 31 of 2020.",4,,
22,0.97,116.683,119.118,To allow this meeting to occur while participating through electronic meetings.,4,,

26,0.97,136.97,140.473,Et's go ahead and dig into our agenda.,4,,
27,0.97,140.473,141.074,It's a short agenda.,4,,
28,0.97,141.074,142.876,We don't have any presentations.,4,,
29,0.97,142.876,156.289,But we do have reports from each of the Council members that are present.,4,,
30,0.97,156.289,163.396,We will begin with agenda item one which is approval of the minutes and there are no minutes for approval today which means we will quickly move into agenda item 2. which is the President's report.,4,,
31,0.97,163.396,169.702,I will endeavor to keep this report short and concise.,4,,
32,0.97,169.702,176.976,"First, the legislative Department including the city council continues to perform a critical work via Telecommuting.",4,,
33,0.97,176.976,182.582,"As a Department and is individual Councilmember offices, we're learning to adapt in order to help flatten the curve and stop the spread of Coronavirus throughout her community.",4,,
34,0.97,182.582,201.467,"In the coming week as we up Roach March 31 of 2020, I will stay in close contact with each of you and the Mayor and public health officials and the state and regional partners as I evaluate whether the Telecommute directive will be extended beyond March 31 of 2020.",4,,
35,0.97,201.467,209.075,"And if so, for how long the extension might be.",4,,
36,0.97,209.075,220.486,"Given the ongoing data of new confirmed cases and having been published every day by the Department of health in Seattle Kinkaid County and public health, I do believe each of us should be prepared to operate in this fashion beyond March 31 of 2020.",4,,
37,0.97,220.486,226.693,"Again, more to come as information out of our public health partners and agencies are released.",4,,
38,0.97,226.693,250.516,"Second, since ending my maternity leave I have had an opportunity to reach out to be individually and for purposes of discussing with you at your work programs with the goal of identifying time sensitive legislation that is not related to emergency response.",4,,
39,0.97,250.516,260.493,I think I will be able to complete this information gathering process earlier this week and we will then be prepared to evaluate a potential modified community schedule that will facilitate the consideration of truly time sensitive legislation that requires committee hearings.,4,,
40,0.97,260.493,265.932,"In doing so, it's important for us to understand that it is likely that any reinstated community meetings will occur Telephonically.",4,,
41,0.97,265.932,274.507,And I also have to take into consideration the burden that Telephonic meetings place on a .'s and stuff and central stuff.,4,,
42,0.97,274.507,292.158,I appreciate that this will be tricky needle for us to thread but my hope is that we will be able to find an arrangement that will allow this city Council to continue to advance advance legislation that is not related to the Covid-19 emergency response and consistent with their.,4,,
43,0.97,292.158,295.295,Program and the need to continue meeting the Pre- existing and ongoing needs of our constituents.,4,,
44,0.97,295.295,297.03,That is my Presidents report.,4,,
45,0.97,297.03,307.373,More to come on these issues in the coming days.,4,,
46,0.97,307.373,312.679,"It's go ahead and move into agenda item 3 which is a preview of today's city council actions, counsel and regional committees.",4,,
47,0.97,312.679,330.363,"Of course colleagues in the city of Seattle declared the civil emergency on Covid-19 on March 3 of 2020 and on March 6 of 2020, along with the Council President we set a protocol that is in place until March 31 of 2020.",4,,
48,0.97,330.363,343.409,This protocol included a request that community members cancel meetings to preserve the health and safety of our work force and to Prioritize legislation related to the current emergency and other emergency business needs.,4,,
49,0.97,343.409,353.052,I will start the next discussion on today's city council actions with the Council and regional committees by calling on the Council members by district number.,4,,
50,0.97,353.052,355.955,Starting with district one and concluding with the two citywide positions of eight and nine.,4,,
51,0.97,355.955,363.496,"If you have a question or comment about the Council members report, I would ask that you make a note of that.",4,,
52,0.97,363.496,370.336,"When I call your name for your report, you can make your comment and can ask a question of a Councilmember about his or her report that that time.",4,,
53,0.97,370.336,388.654,That is just sort of Unfortunately not the prettiest seamless way to do it but I do think it will allow for us to not talk over each other in the Teleconference format.,4,,
54,0.97,388.654,398.431,"So if you could all just hold your questions and put them in the parking lot and then when it's your turn to provide a report, if you have questions of a previous Council members report, that would be the time to bring it up.",4,,
55,0.97,398.431,402.969,"And so, let's go through our reports.",4,,
56,0.97,402.969,406.672,Again I am going to go by district.,4,,
57,0.97,406.672,407.673,District one.,4,,
58,0.97,407.673,416.249,"Councilmember Lisa Herbold, the floor is yours.",4,,
59,0.97,416.249,420.42,Think so much and before I go into my report I would like to have a little bit more clarity.,5,,
60,0.97,420.42,429.896,"For those of us who have already given a report and we have questions about the Council members report to come after hours, can we raise those questions?",5,,
61,0.97,429.896,430.396,Yes.,6,,
62,0.97,430.396,446.646,I appreciate that there is a new numerical challenge of sequence here so I will go back and make sure that we have an opportunity for everybody to ask questions should they have any.,6,,
63,0.97,446.646,447.78,Perfect in thing so much.,7,,
64,0.97,447.78,459.525,I have no business from the public safety and human services Committee on today's Council agenda.,7,,
65,0.97,459.525,462.829,I just want to flag a couple of issues that have come up over the weekend.,7,,
66,0.97,462.829,488.754,I have heard from a lot of constituents about people Congregating on Beach drive as well as Winston park and not advising the social distancing recommendations of staying at least six feet apart from public health to prevent the spread of Covid-19.,7,,
67,0.97,488.754,497.73,I think folks noticed the they have issued an emergency Stay- At-Home order issued yesterday.,7,,
68,0.97,497.73,503.436,With a special recognition of the challenges related to their Marina beaches.,7,,
69,0.97,503.436,506.272,Because of the weather drawing people out.,7,,
70,0.97,506.272,521.687,And I know that district 1 is not the only area of the city challenged with people gathering in public spaces and not observing social distancing recommendations.,7,,
71,0.97,521.687,547.079,I am interested to know a little bit more of what the Council's authority is in the instance where we don't have either an executive order from the Mayor or from King county or the state regarding the closure of our parks.,7,,
72,0.97,547.079,548.514,And beaches.,7,,
73,0.97,548.514,554.22,And so I will be following up with staff to get some more information on that.,7,,
74,0.97,554.22,562.128,I have also reached out to King County.,7,,
75,0.97,562.128,583.082,But licking County Councilmember Mcdermitt as well as Dwight as the chief executive office to express my concern with the lack of clarity under the current state emergency orders . and I look forward to continuing the conversation.,7,,
76,0.97,583.082,618.784,"Basically, I think it's really about making sure we have a clarity of message and without understanding the we still have to allow for people to go to central places and to go out and get exercise . But I am concerned that what has been characterized as a plea for folks to stay home is not clear enough for the public and for our expectations for social distancing.",7,,
77,0.97,618.784,651.517,"Also I just want to add as well that I have been contacted by the Bia President as well as the West Seattle Bia about increased smash and grab crime in the district, since there are so few people out and about and they have raise that issue.",7,,
78,0.97,651.517,662.695,There is a rumor going around that they are going to end the enforcement control in all areas except for third and Pike.,7,,
79,0.97,662.695,674.24,I have been told that they have not been stop . But that they might be in the near future.,7,,
80,0.97,674.24,688.454,But the emphasis of control I think it is good to remember that the patrol is sort of a term of art and that it refers to the type of officers that are on patrol and specifically on overtime.,7,,
81,0.97,688.454,710.409,"So even if they decide to stop using overtime officers and instead they use officers on regular time, they can still look at doing what they call directed patrols in a neighborhood in the district that have these challenges.",7,,
82,0.97,710.409,716.882,So I am expecting to hear more of the chief on that in the near future.,7,,
83,0.97,716.882,727.693,"And then Lastly, I just want to flag a concern that I know the Councilmember Gonzalez has also been made aware of.",7,,
84,0.97,727.693,736.402,I really appreciate the expansion of state unemployment benefits to more people in need in our state.,7,,
85,0.97,736.402,752.017,Not only are people receiving false denials and I understand the state has come forward and has said that those false denials will be corrected.,7,,
86,0.97,752.017,757.923,But I'm really concerned about the huge number of people who are unable to access the system whatsoever.,7,,
87,0.97,757.923,776.442,They had some interactions with Oir over the weekend about my hopes that the state will quickly bring on more staff with the family lead claim as well as state employment insurance claims.,7,,
88,0.97,776.442,791.857,These funds and resources are there for the use of our workers and is it relates specifically to both courses of funds.,7,,
89,0.97,791.857,796.729,Along with the right to access them.,7,,
90,0.97,796.729,800.533,So we just want to flag that that is another big concern that I'm hearing from the public.,7,,
91,0.97,800.533,802.234,That's all I have to say and,7,,
92,0.97,802.234,808.674,Things for that report.,8,,
93,0.97,808.674,827.393,We will modify a little bit the direction here to make sure that we can expedite the briefing process and I will go ahead at the end of each Council members report to see if anyone on the phone has any questions or comment.,8,,
94,0.97,827.393,832.665,Does anyone have any comments or questions for the Councilmember?,8,,
95,0.97,832.665,835.301,Yes.,9,,
96,0.97,835.301,838.871,This is Councilmember Lisa Herbold.,9,,
97,0.97,838.871,842.508,You have the floor.,10,,
98,0.97,842.508,849.315,Thank you Council members a two for that part.,11,,
99,0.97,849.315,850.983,Lots of frustrations in the community for sure.,11,,
100,0.97,850.983,869.835,I have a question about whether the Seattle police Department has received any sort of directive or any particular Ind of training about how to engage with community members.,11,,
101,0.97,869.835,872.705,I know that we are not in a shelter and play situation yet.,11,,
102,0.97,872.705,910.276,"But should one arrive, there is a lot of concern in my community and particularly among folks who don't speak English . black and Brown communities who are worried that if there is not information provided in ways and in languages that they understand, how people are supposed to get information that they are to shelter in place.",11,,
103,0.97,910.276,914.747,And the potential risk of engaging with the law enforcement officer because they don't know that that information is out there.,11,,
104,0.97,914.747,930.663,I had a long conversation with community members along with Council members this weekend about the fact that not everybody is watching the Governors live stream announcements about what we are supposed to be doing.,11,,
105,0.97,930.663,938.704,And Emails are not necessarily reaching everybody who needs the information.,11,,
106,0.97,938.704,954.787,"And so there is a concern that if we reach that stage where we are in a shelter place environment, people that don't know that that exists may have interactions that put them in jeopardy",11,,
107,0.97,954.787,1012.344,"Thanks for the question and as it relates specifically to your question, I don't think that to my knowledge that we have engaged in training specifically related to how to manage and emergency Stay-At- home order in a situation like we are faced in and they do of course receive the escalation training in a place where the judge and as it relates to the consent decree has determined that the Department is in a very good place in facilitating the observations regarding regarding training.",12,,
108,0.97,1012.344,1038.237,"I do strongly believe that we need to talk as a community about what our expectations might be for enforcement . As I am seeing other cities who have moved to a shelter in place scenario . again, it is a staged response.",12,,
109,0.97,1038.237,1044.71,And usually a shelter in place order that first week does not come with enforcement.,12,,
110,0.97,1044.71,1053.619,I have heard that Los Angeles and even though they now have shelter in place for several days.,12,,
111,0.97,1053.619,1058.724,It is now beginning to have those conversations about enforcement.,12,,
112,0.97,1058.724,1088.62,I also note that the parks Department in particular has been doing a lot of creating physical barriers to places and putting signs up to find other ways other than I should say relying on the constant barrage of news from traditional sources but ways of communicating with the public for with the new reality is.,12,,
113,0.97,1088.62,1091.256,For these public spaces.,12,,
114,0.97,1091.256,1132.564,"And I think lots of Signage is at these different locations and this is really important to what is needed to be effective and so I think we really have to have a phased conversation about what enforcement looks like and when I talked to the chiefs over the weekend, she expressed her belief that there is a really big difference about asking people to move along and telling people that they have to move along and taking law enforcement action to ticket somebody.",12,,
115,0.97,1132.564,1139.404,I think there's a lot of room and there for us to have this conversation done we have to.,12,,
116,0.97,1139.404,1140.005,Thank you.,13,,
117,0.97,1140.005,1145.31,Just one more comment and then I will repeat myself.,13,,
118,0.97,1145.31,1159.124,I do think this is an important reminder that everything that we do in response to this crisis needs to be understandable to people who don't speak English.,13,,
119,0.97,1159.124,1177.409,And I'm thinking that our graphic designers in the city or Whoever it is who can turn as much of this information as possible into Info graphic Signage that we can also pass amount.,13,,
120,0.97,1177.409,1181.113,It just going to be really important for us to remember that not everybody speaks or reads English.,13,,
121,0.97,1181.113,1187.352,And their ability to understand the crisis that we are in is just as important if not more so to share the information with their own communities.,13,,
122,0.97,1187.352,1206.872,Thank you Councilmember and that's a good opportunity with Councilmember Gonzalez again that this is a good opportunity to remind you all of the office of immigrant and refugee affairs that has been to a tremendous amount of work compiling information related to the city and the county and the States was once to the emergency.,14,,
123,0.97,1206.872,1208.173,And in a variety of different languages.,14,,
124,0.97,1208.173,1220.886,So they do have a Website and a set of data available in a variety of different languages.,14,,
125,0.97,1220.886,1228.594,And have been doing a tremendous job of trying to interpret every thing in real time in a way that is culturally and linguistically appropriate.,14,,
126,0.97,1228.594,1245.978,So let's not forget about our partners over the office of immigrant and refugee affairs who are working into the wee hours of the morning to make sure that the needs that you have just articulated are being addressed.,14,,
127,0.97,1245.978,1266.932,And so I certainly have been one of the voices on this counsel that has been beating the drum to make sure that we are taking into consideration those who are non-English speakers or English speakers and have certainly a appreciated this work in this regard.,14,,
128,0.97,1266.932,1274.906,Absolutely in my understanding is that they have been really been working closely with public health.,15,,
129,0.97,1274.906,1292.557,And so the resources are so focused on making sure that that public health message gets out . and I just think as we start to move into other parts for kinds of information where trying to get out that we need to support him and do whatever we can throughout the Department in the city as well.,15,,
130,0.97,1292.557,1293.158,Well noted.,16,,
131,0.97,1293.158,1295.627,Any other questions for the Councilmember or comment on her,16,,
132,0.97,1295.627,1300.899,This is Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda.,17,,
133,0.97,1300.899,1304.369,You have the floor.,18,,
134,0.97,1304.369,1315.48,Thing so much for your support and imagine the work happening at the state unemployment insurance Department and the implemented security Department and I would like to provide a report on that as well.,19,,
135,0.97,1315.48,1326.892,I would like to tag onto your remarks as well that we were notified on Wednesday about a number of workers especially in the service industry were getting Notifications of denial.,19,,
136,0.97,1326.892,1341.306,I want to thank the governor's office especially and from the governor's staff who is the lead on labor as they have quickly worked to recognize that it was their system that was sending out denial notices.,19,,
137,0.97,1341.306,1355.52,And they put the updated FAQ on the Website which we will send around for the Councilmember Morales point we will look to see if it is in various languages.,19,,
138,0.97,1355.52,1362.027,"But for folks that may have received a denial notice, they're reviewing each of the notices.",19,,
139,0.97,1362.027,1379.911,People who work in the service industry or any other industry you may have received a denial notice if you are on standby meaning that you don't have to look for another job while you collect unemployment benefits because of the shutdown or lack of demand.,19,,
140,0.97,1379.911,1384.616,That has resulted from Covid-19 and your employer not being able to offer you are hours or neat needing to shut their doors.,19,,
141,0.97,1384.616,1392.057,See can apply for unemployment insurance and Affective March 20 which is last Friday they have put emergency rules into effect so that all workers can get 12 weeks of standby unemployment insurance.,19,,
142,0.97,1392.057,1397.062,Again there are denials that have gone out and those are being reviewed on a Case-By- case basis.,19,,
143,0.97,1397.062,1403.668,And the staff is working as fast as they can to make sure they get the unemployment checks out.,19,,
144,0.97,1403.668,1409.975,You are being asked to continue to file your weekly claims at this time.,19,,
145,0.97,1409.975,1434.099,And they are staffing up so if there is anyone interested in working for the unemployment insurance Department then you can find more information out there and their as fast as they can and we will send out more information as well to make sure he can track whether or not you have been denied and continue to deny that the new system could catch up with your request.,19,,
146,0.97,1434.099,1452.417,Thanks for the governor's officer for catching this Glitch in the system and I think all of our systems are working as fast as they can that this was one that really got notified to them by the front-line workers who were receiving these Notifications.,19,,
147,0.97,1452.417,1460.325,We appreciate the quick work and it is definitely possible for you to receive unemployment insurance if you are on standby status while we wait for this Covid-19 virus to pass.,19,,
148,0.97,1460.325,1474.339,I'm sorry if I glossed over very quickly the fact that they have addressed in a very responsive way the issue of people receiving denials.,20,,
149,0.97,1474.339,1486.952,I did mention that in my report and you are right that I did gloss over it so I appreciate the extra detail at the issue that I am raising that is an issue that is occurring right now is that people cannot file.,20,,
150,0.97,1486.952,1491.456,They cannot access the system and system has too many request.,20,,
151,0.97,1491.456,1505.971,That is the issue that I am pleading for the state to look at with the either the technological approach or having more people on the phone.,20,,
152,0.97,1505.971,1509.841,And processing clients on the phone.,20,,
153,0.97,1509.841,1510.642,Thank you.,20,,
154,0.97,1510.642,1513.578,Absolutely.,21,,
155,0.97,1513.578,1519.651,And they are hiring so continue to spread the word about that and answering those calls.,21,,
156,0.97,1519.651,1520.685,Will put some more information,21,,
157,0.97,1520.685,1528.393,Other any questions or comments for Councilmember Lisa Herbold?,22,,
158,0.97,1528.393,1528.994,Okay.,22,,
159,0.97,1528.994,1530.562,Let's move along.,22,,
160,0.97,1530.562,1533.131,District 2 Councilmember Tammy Morales.,22,,
161,0.97,1533.131,1537.302,Good morning colleagues.,23,,
162,0.97,1537.302,1554.185,On today's counsel calendar we will be hearing counsel bill 119670 which will allocate an additional million dollars from Hsd to the office of economic development for the stabilization fund.,23,,
163,0.97,1554.185,1565.53,So we will be hearing more about that and as you all know this actual disasters sending Shockwaves through our community and particularly devastating or small businesses.,23,,
164,0.97,1565.53,1580.345,As I mentioned earlier I was on the phone this weekend talking with some of our small business owners about what they need as folks are worried as we are that virtually all spending across the city is coming to an end.,23,,
165,0.97,1580.345,1583.949,Businesses are shutting and owners are worried about how other toys are going to make it.,23,,
166,0.97,1583.949,1589.321,There worried about rent.,23,,
167,0.97,1589.321,1596.661,Property owners are worried about what they are going to do to pay their mortgage if their tenants rent is frozen or if there is a moratorium.,23,,
168,0.97,1596.661,1604.769,This is this Cascading effect of everything that is happening right now as you are all aware.,23,,
169,0.97,1604.769,1619.584,I did speak with Congressman Smith this weekend about trying to make sure that we have more community development grant money in these relief packages so that we have a tool and a resource to continue to support small businesses.,23,,
170,0.97,1619.584,1628.093,And they also asked if we the small business loans that they're working on it have any sort of Forgivable component.,23,,
171,0.97,1628.093,1633.198,Particularly if businesses keep their workers idle rather than laying them off.,23,,
172,0.97,1633.198,1639.704,So that they can continue to get the benefits that they need.,23,,
173,0.97,1639.704,1664.496,I do want to take just a couple of minutes to talk about what our committee will be doing in response to the crisis of the community economic development committee that will be forming recovery planning work group and we really want to start thinking about how once we get through this crisis and how we can rebuild in a way that increases local resilience.,23,,
174,0.97,1664.496,1668.867,I note the city and state level that we are mobilizing to react to the crisis as quickly as we can.,23,,
175,0.97,1668.867,1678.943,And I have talked about what we need to do to stop the spread to keep people at home and to support daily survival.,23,,
176,0.97,1678.943,1686.851,But we also need to be mobilizing for long-term public investment and the guaranteed job programs.,23,,
177,0.97,1686.851,1698.229,And if we are going to address or prevent unemployment then we will need an unprecedented and massive investment in public art and public infrastructure and public employment programs to support the recovery.,23,,
178,0.97,1698.229,1700.865,And we will have to do it in a way that is equitable.,23,,
179,0.97,1700.865,1719.551,I am really worried that if we do have a bunch of businesses and storefronts shutting that we will sort of pave the way for what some are calling disaster Gentrification to happen with this accelerated displacement.,23,,
180,0.97,1719.551,1730.895,'s we really need to be thinking now about what we will do to protect their communities and to really rebuild for the people who live in a communities.,23,,
181,0.97,1730.895,1733.164,It's going to require a Federal relief package.,23,,
182,0.97,1733.164,1738.603,No question about that.,23,,
183,0.97,1738.603,1747.579,But it also has brought into relief for me just how radical some of these shifts will be.,23,,
184,0.97,1747.579,1756.721,We know that 40% of Seattle's general revenue comes from sales tax and the recent Commission for.,23,,
185,0.97,1756.721,1770.034,Made it really clear that cities will find it virtually impossible in the month to fund our public services if we don't find new funding sources and new ways to manage our revenue.,23,,
186,0.97,1770.034,1799.564,This is clearly the time for structural shift in how we finance public services and as everyone knows we had a few questions about this but Kshama Sawant and I have called for this with the progressive revenue bill and I want our counsel colleagues to know that I stand ready to work with you to create an ordinance that generates the kind of revenue that will really pave the way for the kind of economic recovery that will keep people housed and employed.,23,,
187,0.97,1799.564,1806.938,I am worried that without this progress that we may find ourselves doing triage for the next several years.,23,,
188,0.97,1806.938,1812.043,I just want to make clear that I'm committed to working with all of you to address this Head- on.,23,,
189,0.97,1812.043,1825.99,And my hope is that we can pass an ordinance soon that could really start to address our revenue crisis and pave the way for the sort of long-term investments that we will need to do.,23,,
190,0.97,1825.99,1847.745,Tanke Councilmember Tammy Morales for that report I think you also for your early expression of willingness to collaborate and work with each of us as your colleagues on the city council on the vertically important piece of legislation.,24,,
191,0.97,1847.745,1848.513,We really appreciate it.,24,,
192,0.97,1848.513,1854.819,Any questions or comments for Councilmember Tammy Morales?,24,,
193,0.97,1854.819,1855.22,All right.,24,,
194,0.97,1855.22,1861.326,Hearing none we will move along.,24,,
195,0.97,1861.326,1868.032,I just want to note on the report of Tammy Morales she mentioned she has a bill for can consideration at full counsel.,24,,
196,0.97,1868.032,1883.047,Last week I offer the opportunity to have the counsel central staff available at counsel briefings to provide folks on the line an opportunity to ask questions or receive a briefing directly from counsel central staff.,24,,
197,0.97,1883.047,1890.822,We requested that counsel central staff be available so Councilmember Tammy Morales will handle that bill on her own.,24,,
198,0.97,1890.822,1892.757,During the full counsel this afternoon.,24,,
199,0.97,1892.757,1904.769,And of course they will speak to you individually off-line if questions arise about that bill between now and 2 PM.,24,,
200,0.97,1904.769,1912.143,Let's go ahead and move along to District 4 with Councilmember Peterson and the floor is yours.,24,,
201,0.97,1912.143,1918.349,Good morning colleagues.,25,,
202,0.97,1918.349,1929.994,I'm grateful we are resuming counsel briefings today so we can increase Eric Kim indication to her constituents during this crisis I'm grateful to the Council president for making the sacrifices to return early to lead the city council during this trying time for city.,25,,
203,0.97,1929.994,1950.481,Regarding the transportation utilities committee we normally meet the first and third Wednesdays of each month however there are no committee meeting scheduled at this time there to go the crisis and therefore there is no transportation items on this afternoon's agenda.,25,,
204,0.97,1950.481,1962.727,At the special meeting with city council this past Thursday we had passed a couple of relief measures and one of which is waiting waiting on late fees and utility bills for both Seattle city light and Seattle public utilities.,25,,
205,0.97,1962.727,1969.6,I would like to thank the Mayor and her teams for crafting that Emma counsel colleagues for supporting it along with the other bills that Councilmember Tammy Morales mentioned.,25,,
206,0.97,1969.6,1978.343,For utilities this is in addition to the discount programs and flexible payment plans and no shut off policy.,25,,
207,0.97,1978.343,1992.156,There are three transportation items I would like to discuss as we encourage people to stay safe at home and the city government has temporarily suspended the 72 hour parking rule that was announced a couple of days ago.,25,,
208,0.97,1992.156,2024.856,"The transportation benefit which has routes through Seattle and if King County decides not to pursue regional bus measures for the August while it due to the Coronavirus, I want to assure Seattle and my colleagues that it is a priority for me as chairman of the transportation committee to maintain an extensive transit network that is relied upon by workers and businesses and seniors and nearly everyone else throughout Seattle.",25,,
209,0.97,2024.856,2034.599,I will continue to work with you all in the Mayor and King County Metro community Stakeholders to explore the best future options to renew funding for that important transit program and the transit benefit district.,25,,
210,0.97,2034.599,2047.211,Consistent with what the Councilmember Tammy Morales is saying as we do with the crisis at hand now and also try to look to the future in an optimistic way.,25,,
211,0.97,2047.211,2054.318,Looking at one of the transportation benefit district is a way for us to unite and join together and focus on the bright future for city.,25,,
212,0.97,2054.318,2069.734,Third item as you know they have announced if you cannot afford it do not need to pay the fare to ride the buses or light rail during the crisis.,25,,
213,0.97,2069.734,2074.005,And also much is temporarily operating on a reduced bus schedule starting today.,25,,
214,0.97,2074.005,2087.251,Follow the links that I have to the transportation stuff on my log and all of our Blogs and Websites with Seattle.Gov Forward/Counsel.,25,,
215,0.97,2087.251,2102.266,So even with these temporary reductions and the frequency of bus service during the crisis we are relieved that King County Metro's trying to maintain most bus routes throughout Seattle and connecting everyone from places of care to services including grocery stores and jobs for Seattle residents unable to work from home.,25,,
216,0.97,2102.266,2114.979,"And district 4, there have been many committee meetings that have been counsel canceled and our office hours are happening remotely via Skype or phone.",25,,
217,0.97,2114.979,2126.257,Just Email us with Seattle.Gov for district 4. a lot of restaurants are shutting down.,25,,
218,0.97,2126.257,2130.461,But there are several that are open and are relying on take out.,25,,
219,0.97,2130.461,2151.616,This Thursday we picked up dinner for the family on Thursday night and there also a bunch of other restaurant and if you just go to my Website there is a list of a bunch of them like village sushi and the University village.,25,,
220,0.97,2151.616,2161.325,I hope that if you're able to do that and to support your local restaurants that that is great while we still can thank you for mentioning the Councilmember talking about foreclosures.,25,,
221,0.97,2161.325,2174.739,As you talk about extending Eviction protection . that will be another wave to look at in terms of people trying to pay their mortgages.,25,,
222,0.97,2174.739,2185.349,So I am looking forward to working with her colleagues if there is any sort of push to have the state or Federal Government or banks to have a moratorium on foreclosures.,25,,
223,0.97,2185.349,2191.522,Thanks Councilmember Alex Pedersen.,26,,
224,0.97,2191.522,2206.237,Really quickly I just wanted to let you know that I have received some communication over the weekend with regard to Seattle city light.,26,,
225,0.97,2206.237,2222.153,And in pursuing their ongoing plans around work apparently they are doing Preplanned work in certain neighborhoods that are affecting certain customers in terms of Preplanned outages and throughout certain neighborhoods.,26,,
226,0.97,2222.153,2235.7,"So the Screenshot that I received over the weekend showed that 326 customers were impacted on Sunday, March 20 starting at 8:30 am.",26,,
227,0.97,2235.7,2243.608,And they were estimated to be without power until close to 3 PM on Sunday.,26,,
228,0.97,2243.608,2259.023,So we just want to flag that as a concern that I received from someone in community about not necessarily being conducive to encouraging people to stay at home if they don't have electricity at home.,26,,
229,0.97,2259.023,2268.332,During the day.,26,,
230,0.97,2268.332,2291.222,So I just want the utilities Committee in hopes that you will be able to speak with the Seattle city light about how they are approaching their planned work for outages and how they are communicating that in the context or approaching that in the context of the current interest of the city to make sure that people have a reason as possible to stay at home.,26,,
231,0.97,2291.222,2295.459,Things Council president and I will get a comprehensive update on that soon.,27,,
232,0.97,2295.459,2298.029,Great.,28,,
233,0.97,2298.029,2311.442,Any questions for Councilmember Alex Pedersen or any comments on his report? fair enough and we will go ahead and move to D5.,28,,

235,0.97,2319.35,2322.386,Have a few matters this morning with three items on introduction and referral calendar this afternoon.,29,,
236,0.97,2322.386,2342.273,One is the ointment to the Seattle administration in two of us to the Seattle board of trustees and the two library appointments when he put the turnaround to allow for the Quorum for the April board meeting.,29,,
237,0.97,2342.273,2347.745,So we are going to vote on the library items this afternoon without the standard committee process to allow for the library board to continue their work.,29,,
238,0.97,2347.745,2355.619,Basically they need a Quorum to address library Servers and operations and financial protocols in response to Covid- 19.,29,,
239,0.97,2355.619,2364.695,"This is our way as you were saying earlier Council President, that moving forward the issues will have to get done quickly as you shared to keep the city moving.",29,,

244,0.97,2404.268,2419.95,Along with the work in the transit benefit district we have been discussing some of these issues with the role on the transit board with no fee and certainly on a reduced schedule.,29,,
245,0.97,2419.95,2458.722,And I could also add in light of what the Councilmember and those of us who are still trying to meet with constituents as we have been monitoring our legislative representatives and their updates . and have been on the phone with some of our electives in Olympia as well as our electives in D.C. what we have put together and some people may want to do this as well is the stuff puts together every morning a great call list or top 10 list or a hit list and I just go through and try to have those conversations that were originally scheduled with particular constituents organizations or elected leaders and that seems to be working well for us.,29,,
246,0.97,2458.722,2460.925,Just having the call list and just going through it.,29,,
247,0.97,2460.925,2465.229,It's a lot like call time if you remember.,29,,

257,0.97,2555.219,2563.294,My team has also participated in the selection process for urban forestry commissioners and I look forward to working with the commissioners as we move forward later this year and working on a Star stronger tree ordinance.,31,,

266,0.97,2614.478,2619.65,Have also continued my constituent office hours over the phone and we are busy over,31,,
267,0.97,2619.65,2634.865,Great and thank you Councilmember Dan Strauss for that wonderful report and for doing that hands-on constituent service work like so many other the Councilmembers have been doing as well.,32,,
268,0.97,2634.865,2643.007,Any other questions or comments for Councilmember Dan Strauss?,32,,

270,0.97,2649.279,2661.025,Thanks so much Council President Gonzales and I joined the rest of my colleagues in thinking you for coming back early and taking that sacrifice to come back and leave the Council.,33,,
271,0.97,2661.025,2670.134,It has been really good to have you back and I look forward to working with you over the next couple of months during this trying time for city and region and global community.,33,,
272,0.97,2670.134,2701.665,Echoing a lot of the remarks that my colleagues that I have been spending quite a bit of my time working with constituents and small businesses to try to navigate the immense pressure that they are feeling and in our organization and District 7 will also have quite a few and to navigate the stresses that all of them are feeling in terms of their overhead cost and being able to keep their employees employed and critically to keep their employees on their benefit.,33,,
273,0.97,2701.665,2709.573,"Particularly their health benefits which, given the nature of the pandemic is exceptionally critical investment in our work force.",33,,
274,0.97,2709.573,2730.894,"And so to that end, all of our offices have been doing a lot of work with businesses and individuals to warm them of the city's efforts towards providing small business stabilization fund relief for utilities and a moratorium on Evictions that commercially and for residences.",33,,
275,0.97,2730.894,2749.413,I joined the Councilmember Tammy Morales earlier this week or rather last week on a call with the Mayor's small business recovery task force Cochaired by the former Councilmember and the former governor Gary Locke.,33,,
276,0.97,2749.413,2755.853,Hopefully those are just the beginning of many more conversations.,33,,
277,0.97,2755.853,2773.137,A couple of the Takeaways that I thought were really key from the conversation was the need for a lot of Federal relief to pass through the city and considering that we have compiled a massive list of businesses that have applied for small business stabilization funds.,33,,
278,0.97,2773.137,2778.642,These are businesses that we as Councilmembers know intimately as consumers and neighbors and friends.,33,,
279,0.97,2778.642,2782.312,We know who needs the relief and we know where they are.,33,,
280,0.97,2782.312,2802.032,It makes sense that there is as much Federal resources we can get to pass through in that capacity to make sure relief is getting to the people that need them and that workers are emphasized and making sure people have their basic needs met . This is something we are well situated to do as a city.,33,,
281,0.97,2802.032,2810.34,And something that we could really use Federal relief to do.,33,,
282,0.97,2810.34,2812.776,I think that that idea and a number of others were raised.,33,,
283,0.97,2812.776,2826.19,I look forward to continuing to work with them to get some real relief to the small businesses and workers of the city who are really facing the brunt of this catastrophe from an economic standpoint.,33,,

294,0.97,2941.104,2949.079,But I was very pleased over the weekend to go and visit Holy mountain brewing in Interbay in our brewing community and the have bottles and Growlers to go.,33,,

299,0.97,2994.958,3013.677,"I am pleased to say as a number of you already know, based on the representations of the Mayor's office last week, that the Northlake transitional encampment is going to be allowed at least for the duration of the public health crisis to stay in place.",33,,
300,0.97,3013.677,3038.001,I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to try to nail down a more concrete Timeline of that commitment to make sure that we have a settled in some respects and that made be through a Council ordinance or through hammering out a tentative agreement with the executives.,33,,
301,0.97,3038.001,3054.351,That I am committed to making sure that in this time of crisis we are not seeking to Evict transitional Encampmet that will allow people to stay in place and not to be in a situation where there in a Unsanctioned camp and in a less safe environment.,33,,
302,0.97,3054.351,3075.205,I'm very proud of the city that we are stepping up and letting that encampment stand in place and I'm looking forward to working with my counsel colleagues and executives to make sure that we have a more definitive agreement nail down.,33,,
303,0.97,3075.205,3085.248,I also want to thank the executives for last week's putting in place new guidelines around the navigation team in this time of uncertainty and in this time of crisis.,33,,
304,0.97,3085.248,3107.471,We certainly need to tighten up and reevaluate our policy around the removal of Encampments and my understanding of the new policy is that it is with the executives that only cams representing the most egregious obstruction of a public Right- Of-Way will be removed.,33,,
305,0.97,3107.471,3110.273,My committee will continue to monitor this situation.,33,,
306,0.97,3110.273,3117.914,To ensure that the navigation team is sticking to the new protocol that has been established.,33,,
307,0.97,3117.914,3137.667,It is critical during this time of uncertainty that Unsanctioned Encampments that don't go oppose an imminent threat to public safety or public Right- Of-Way not be cleared in order to provide the kinds of stability and predictability that will be essential for successful public health response.,33,,
308,0.97,3137.667,3153.817,"I look forward to monitoring the new policy from the executives and making sure that it is adhered to more broadly, something I want to look into and flag at the briefing if anyone is interested in looking into this with me.",33,,
309,0.97,3153.817,3176.339,"Massachusetts and New York under the right to shelter laws allow in times of crisis or rather as a tactic, the bookings of surplus hotel rooms in order to get people off the street and get them inside quickly on a temporary basis.",33,,
310,0.97,3176.339,3199.529,I want to potentially explore what that might look like locally as a potential strategy to get people off the street and to get them inside and to do it in a way that is consistent with social distancing and a possible way to give boon to a struggling hospitality industry that has suffered from the massive Drop- off and tourism.,33,,
311,0.97,3199.529,3211.675,It may be a way to use the surplus hotel demand in the city as part of the response.,33,,
312,0.97,3211.675,3216.179,That's something I want to look into and there are some states that offer an example of how they can be done.,33,,
313,0.97,3216.179,3217.781,I think that could be something to dig into.,33,,
314,0.97,3217.781,3226.79,Finally I will close similar to these remarks that my colleagues had shared that our office hours continue unabated.,33,,
315,0.97,3226.79,3230.427,It gets more critical now than ever that we make ourselves available in these confusing times.,33,,

318,0.97,3258.922,3285.248,There is a discussion of friends at discovery park about the city acquiring some of the Federal land that still remains in Federal possession and there is a proposal to slim what discovery Park is bringing to Flynn with a quick turnaround and other public part and they will still allow the power to remain operational but they would reclaim more land for the public.,33,,
319,0.97,3285.248,3292.922,To an interesting proposal and I look forward to working with them to see if we can realize that vision.,33,,
320,0.97,3292.922,3311.441,And also having been raised by couple of constituents as this becomes increasingly more urban environment with a greater density of residents and pedestrian improvements in the Bay will be increasingly a critical conversation.,33,,
321,0.97,3311.441,3320.984,I look forward to working with folks to make sure all of the communities in our city are Walkable and Likable and in keeping with our vision of zero goals.,33,,

327,0.97,3369.632,3388.852,We did have a conversation with King County that does have hotel vouchers and the have a number of hotels they're working with with mostly motels at this point to try to get people out of permanent supportive housing were stable and who are healthier and they're not showing symptoms of Covid-19 but they're also Elders and have a compromise system.,36,,
328,0.97,3388.852,3398.128,It also frees up places and permanent Supportiv housing and shelters and the partnership with the hotels that has been tremendous.,36,,
329,0.97,3398.128,3437.2,We do want to thank some of the hotel owners we have been talking to especially the downtown hotel owners along with the hotel Association but there are motel vouchers that can help to keep our hotels afloat while we find stable housing that is more isolated in nature especially for some of our Elders and folks with compromised immune systems to get out of the more crowded living situation and get into hotels with a lot of logistics including food delivery and Cleanings that will be talking with her friends here as well.,36,,
330,0.97,3437.2,3448.778,And this is a program that they had been able to fund with hotel vouchers and the process of engaging with the owners to scale up so we will announce that coming up soon.,36,,
331,0.97,3448.778,3466.429,This is a great example of where the partnership is needed for local business owners to keep local businesses afloat for needed services to her friends with public health and King County.,36,,
332,0.97,3466.429,3479.242,Want to flag some of the conversations are underway along the hotel voucher program that has been a godsend to the people that need space and also a financial boon to those hotels with so many vacant rooms.,36,,
333,0.97,3479.242,3491.421,It's a great idea and good minds think alike and more to come on that my partners I County along the downtown strategic locations that people can be close to additional services.,36,,

343,0.97,3588.785,3599.662,And we want to have regular briefings the CBO director and the central staff director as well.,39,,

348,0.97,3681.544,3686.616,And also to provide housing for those who are need of critical housing now.,39,,
349,0.97,3686.616,3698.561,And to get more social distancing and our permanent supportive housing operations and Nonprofits partners.,39,,
350,0.97,3698.561,3707.136,We have the opportunity to join in with the executive team Online as well with the permanent housing providers.,39,,
351,0.97,3707.136,3738.801,Have a brief up on some of those conversations and like everyone else they are in dire need and asking the Federal Government for support to get the test in hand especially for the front-line housing providers are working every day with vulnerable populations and those who are Elders in our community who need supportive housing and who are in a shelter.,39,,
352,0.97,3738.801,3743.906,In the absence of additional tests we are working quickly to try to figure out how we can get more sites stood up especially with L.A.,39,,
353,0.97,3743.906,3749.979,Their standing up sites for temporary use . So the assessment can be done.,39,,
354,0.97,3749.979,3770.299,"As we mentioned prior, the work that we are doing with King County and the lead to be in partnership with local businesses and the hotel, I'm hoping that will quickly expand and I want to thank King County for all of their work to get hotel vouchers out the door.",39,,
355,0.97,3770.299,3786.749,And also want to think the Hoteliers who are standing up some of our local downtown boutique hotels were looking for opportunities to offer their space and make it hotel rooms to shelter those who are well but extremely vulnerable and those were elderly.,39,,
356,0.97,3786.749,3794.457,We have more information to share shooting about the logistics in terms of meals and staffing.,39,,
357,0.97,3794.457,3814.577,So that locations are clean on a regular basis but this is a great example of where local businesses can partner with local government to make sure we respond to the crisis as we wait for the Feds to send additional testing supplies or additional medical supplies and personnel as well.,39,,
358,0.97,3814.577,3817.947,This is exactly the type of partnership that will help to save lives.,39,,

360,0.97,3821.484,3826.789,And those working in hotels conversations to come.,39,,

362,0.97,3829.592,3856.219,We have a number of questions we have put in about how this crisis is affecting the work force and also the importance of making sure grocery workers and the gig economy workers a detective with a number of questions put into the Mayor's office and we know they are working very fast to make sure we are getting supplies and guidance out to those workers who are already showing how essential they are.,39,,
363,0.97,3856.219,3876.639,I think there's a lot of dialogue Online that many of the workers that we deem essential right now in a crisis like this are also the workers making minimum wage and they don't have access to longer lead benefits.,39,,
364,0.97,3876.639,3888.317,And I think there's a really important moment for us to pause and recognize the importance of their work and especially grocery workers and hotel workers and front-line Cna's and medical staff workers.,39,,
365,0.97,3888.317,3893.422,Those who are also taking the trash out in his medical facilities are extremely important for us in order to the system to keep operating.,39,,
366,0.97,3893.422,3948.21,Thanks in advance to the Mayor's office for the questions we have put in and we have been talking with some of the talk Online as folks have seen this weekend with one of the local retailers putting N95 masks out for sale and I want to thank target for their fast response to that and especially on social media and calling it to their attention that those masks were being sold and the executive in King county in the Mayor's office and the deputy Mayor and Governor Ensley to get those off the shelf and into the hands of Departmen of health personnel so that those could be deployed to our first responders and to the medical staff across the state.,39,,
367,0.97,3948.21,3953.949,It is critical that we make sure all of the masks and gloves and personal protective gear get into the hands of medical providers and first responders.,39,,
368,0.97,3953.949,3956.585,Thanks to everybody who had called attention to that Online and to the fast.,39,,
369,0.97,3956.585,3962.625,Of everyone involved to get those off the shelf and into the government hands.,39,,
370,0.97,3962.625,3971.0,We appreciate it and we know that target reached out to express their apologies for that situation.,39,,
371,0.97,3971.0,3978.307,As we said everyone is working as fast as they can and we appreciate the quick work to correct that.,39,,
372,0.97,3978.307,3984.413,Also we want to pile onto what they had started with that we continue together in public gatherings.,39,,
373,0.97,3984.413,3991.32,Are very clear in choosing words over the weekend and on Friday.,39,,
374,0.97,3991.32,3995.825,We need people to honor the social distancing requirements or is there is a possibility of additional direct is coming down.,39,,
375,0.97,3995.825,4015.811,This is for the health of our community and the health of individuals will even feel healthy and especially now there is more information coming out about those 20 to 40 and 20-50 who thought the maybe not susceptible to this disease but are showing symptoms and are also now being hospitalized.,39,,
376,0.97,4015.811,4025.454,Even if they're not showing symptoms then there is a high possibility that you are carrying it and you're contagious and you're shutting the virus.,39,,
377,0.97,4025.454,4035.831,So for folks who have not yet heard that maybe they had not seen the press conferences from the Mayor's office and I will take this opportunity to say that walking is fine and running is fine.,39,,
378,0.97,4035.831,4046.909,But playing activities such as basketball and volleyball in group activities and organized activities and sitting close to each other is really risky and is increasing the spread of the virus.,39,,
379,0.97,4046.909,4069.131,"It is fine to go and have a picnic with those whom you live with or to go for a walk or run with people that you live with but if you do not live with somebody, keeping a distance of six feet and avoiding social gatherings like the one that we saw the weekend and some of our beautiful parks is going to help reduce the spread of the disease and save lives.",39,,
380,0.97,4069.131,4074.737,We want people to practice good mental health activities during this time were social isolation can lead to depression.,39,,
381,0.97,4074.737,4081.811,You want people to engage in social interaction over Video streams and phone calls and text Messaging.,39,,
382,0.97,4081.811,4090.019,But please keep her social interaction limited and do not do group gatherings or bonfires or large picnics.,39,,
383,0.97,4090.019,4116.645,We need people to be healthy and to get outside if they need to take a walk but did not engage in that kind of activity so I'm concerned that that could lead to additional guidance and that it will lead to the spread of diseases and I want to thank the governor's office for his thought full approach for getting messages out to the public we know we need to be thoughtful and how we was on and we need people to not panic but he prepared.,39,,
384,0.97,4116.645,4128.29,I think his staff leadership has been tremendous in helping to get the information out along with our Mayor and the King County executives and Council.,39,,
385,0.97,4128.29,4130.459,So I think that that is all for me.,39,,
386,0.97,4130.459,4159.488,We do appreciate these counsel briefings and so thank you for organizing these and your willingness to bring this back and it has been hope helpful to share what folks are up to make sure we are not just Duplicating requests for public health or to our partners with the business and other entities of government to be coordinated because I believe this has been a very productive call.,39,,

411,0.97,4346.375,4357.119,We have seen across the city that with the closure of schools that many individuals are suffering the front of the lack of viable Childcare options.,42,,
412,0.97,4357.119,4376.038,Our first responders are of course not immune from the lack of safe and viable Childcare options throughout the city and certainly the closures related to Coronavirus are having an even creating an even deeper impact in terms of what we all know to be Childcare shortages throughout the city.,42,,
413,0.97,4376.038,4398.36,I have asked counsel central staff in particular and those from my office to take a closer look at the proposed Childcare pilot program and to make sure that we are not rolling back on our commitments as required by statutory ordinance to the families and education preschool and promise levy.,42,,
414,0.97,4398.36,4407.669,And while also making sure that we are meeting the identified needs by deal and executive as it relates to Childcare needs for our first responders.,42,,
415,0.97,4407.669,4415.811,I just want to make folks aware that that is an effort that is being proposed by the executive.,42,,
416,0.97,4415.811,4439.601,"For those of you who have been on the Council for a while, you have heard me sort of ferociously protect the revenue source from the levy to make sure that we are holding Fidelity to the ordinance that was passed by voters.",42,,
417,0.97,4439.601,4448.11,Along with the duty and the legal duty and obligation to make sure we are complying with the parameters of that ordinance.,42,,
418,0.97,4448.11,4455.617,And it's unclear to me how the state of emergency impact that requirement if at all.,42,,
419,0.97,4455.617,4474.136,And so we have counsel central staff taking closer look at making sure that we are not going to step on any toes as it relates to or gets into any legal issues as it relates to using the revenue source.,42,,
420,0.97,4474.136,4477.005,In the manner proposed by deal and the Mayor's office.,42,,
421,0.97,4477.005,4489.017,We also want to thank Seattle public schools for announcing just recently that they will be standing up 12 Childcare sites throughout the school district.,42,,
422,0.97,4489.017,4509.071,Of course for those of you who have Childcare issues you know that the Seattle public schools is a great partner to us here in the city of Seattle in terms of Co-Locating Childcare centers and facilities with the Seattle preschool program and throughout its schools and throughout the entire city of Seattle.,42,,
423,0.97,4509.071,4525.487,I really want to them for stepping up and for pulling together a plan and releasing a plan that identifies 12 Childcare sites throughout the city that will be ready to go I believe this week.,42,,
424,0.97,4525.487,4536.899,I hope that we can continue to focus on the substantive issues at play which is to meet the Childcare needs of children and families throughout the city.,42,,
425,0.97,4536.899,4546.608,And that we can stay focused on that as opposed to who has an obligation to do what first.,42,,
426,0.97,4546.608,4557.819,I'm really happy to see that the school district has made an announcement and I'm extremely grateful to them with more to come on this emergency Childcare pilot program in the coming days.,42,,
427,0.97,4557.819,4570.232,Lastly we have two bills on this afternoon's introduction and referral calendar and appear on today's instruction and referral calendar.,42,,
428,0.97,4570.232,4578.34,These emergency pieces of legislation and response to the Coronavirus Covid-19 crisis.,42,,
429,0.97,4578.34,4587.316,We know that just 24 days ago that the first person in Washington succumb to Covid-19.,42,,
430,0.97,4587.316,4609.171,As of 3 PM yesterday our State Department of health reported 95 deaths and nearly 2000 individuals that have tested positive for Coronavirus throughout the state . Our state and regional government has been working tirelessly to implement health measures to flatten the curve and stop the spread of the Coronavirus throughout her communities.,42,,
431,0.97,4609.171,4634.196,We just heard during this report that many of these reports that have been Úundertaken by the state and regional partners for purposes of keeping us all safe and stop the spread of Coronavirus throughout her communities and in less than a month this crisis has Upended our normal life and change the way many of us are able to live our lives or to earn our livelihood.,42,,
432,0.97,4634.196,4640.902,We know that thousands of workers and thousands of workers across the city have been laid off as a result of these emergency orders.,42,,
433,0.97,4640.902,4662.624,Which is an order that I support and it was absolutely necessary for the greater public good that this order effectively closed all schools and restaurants and bars and fitness centers and beauty salons and other nonessential businesses that are located throughout her city Interstate.,42,,
434,0.97,4662.624,4667.596,Those business closures are mandated through at least March 31 with social distancing is the current and best defense against putting the Coronavirus.,42,,
435,0.97,4667.596,4682.544,Even for the businesses that are able to go Online or to do Take-Out or this Online ordering the many of them have had to significantly reduce their staffing in order to keep their doors open.,42,,
436,0.97,4682.544,4696.758,Even though many of our businesses are nonessential businesses have modified the business model in order to keep their doors open to provide services to people in the community.,42,,
437,0.97,4696.758,4701.963,It is of course with a lot less staff than they had before the executive emergency order that was issued by Governor Ensley.,42,,
438,0.97,4701.963,4709.337,Not surprisingly that during the unemployment claims it shows a dramatic increase.,42,,
439,0.97,4709.337,4718.28,And the numbers are staggering in the service and education industry alone and unemployment claims have gone up nearly 600% in a single week.,42,,
440,0.97,4718.28,4729.891,I know I'm not alone in trying to find ways to respond to this crisis and I want to thank my colleagues on the Mayor for their leadership and commitment.,42,,
441,0.97,4729.891,4758.12,And serving the people of Seattle and beyond along with the governor also taking steps in order to figure out how to triage this crisis specifically for Renters who are oftentimes dependent on the service industry jobs and are living paycheck to paycheck and here in the city of Seattle we know that more than 50% of the city rents as opposed to owns a property or homes.,42,,
442,0.97,4758.12,4770.699,This is really why we are sponsoring the two bills for Council consideration.,42,,
443,0.97,4770.699,4775.137,One addresses the long-term impacts that many Renters will likely be experiencing after the Mayor declares the state emergency to be over.,42,,
444,0.97,4775.137,4778.907,The legislation have adopted to at a specific time limited pool for tenants to use in Eviction defense.,42,,
445,0.97,4778.907,4791.82,The bill does not prohibit the unlawful Detainer's and it does not have it the issuance of the 20 day notice to vacate and it does not prohibit the restitution.,42,,
446,0.97,4791.82,4816.778,It is not the rent or Eviction freezer moratorium but again it is a tool that has been identified that have helped out more time for impacted Renters to get right sized financially with the efforts underway.,42,,
447,0.97,4816.778,4827.055,And we want to emphasize that if people are able to pay rent that they should be paying their rent on time.,42,,
448,0.97,4827.055,4850.712,And to do that according to whatever agreement they have with their landlord and for everyone else there are folks at every level of government who are working to figure out how to keep people in their homes to make sure they continue to be secure in their housing and the reality is some of these individuals who have lost their jobs and who are waiting to get to the backlog and in some cases as they mention they cannot even get into the Backlogs of the cannot access the system.,42,,
449,0.97,4850.712,4885.847,They will get the benefits made available by the state and Federal Government . in the meantime we need to make sure that these Renters that had been able to pay their rent but for this recent layoff with this opportunity and time to catch up and to catch their breath and to be able to find a mutually agreeable terms with their landlords to be able to deal with the rent that they may have as a result of these similar emergencies.,42,,
450,0.97,4885.847,4893.688,It does provide more time to Renters to pay their rent in certain circumstances.,42,,
451,0.97,4893.688,4901.329,In essence this allows Renters that may find themselves between paychecks and safety net benefits like unemployment insurance to enter into a monthly rent payment plan.,42,,
452,0.97,4901.329,4910.672,With their landlords as long as they can become current on their full rent balance within a year of the end of the civil emergency.,42,,
453,0.97,4910.672,4919.18,It will suspend late fees and interest or other charges related late payments during the civil emergency and six months after they declare the emergency to be over.,42,,
454,0.97,4919.18,4924.552,Heard from a number of folks that found themselves again abruptly unemployed in the last two weeks.,42,,
455,0.97,4924.552,4934.529,And there is a significant backlog in getting there and employment insurance applications approved.,42,,
456,0.97,4934.529,4942.971,The good news is the backlog is starting to turn around and some people are starting to get notices that they were falsely denied.,42,,
457,0.97,4942.971,4946.641,"But in the meantime, people have a real for your and that is a reality of becoming housing insecure.",42,,
458,0.97,4946.641,4956.318,Or Unfortunately Un-Housed and we do not want to see that occur because that would exacerbate the city's housing and homelessness crisis.,42,,
459,0.97,4956.318,4983.745,This payment plan as needed will hopefully provide additional time to allow people to get the unemployment benefit and rental insistence to catch up on their rents and enough effect this is what this bill will do it together I think these bills will help to serve the best interest of our local housing Ecosystem with State and local government to provide relief.,42,,
460,0.97,4983.745,4990.452,Along with thousands of households impacted by economically impacted by the Coronavirus crisis.,42,,
461,0.97,4990.452,5035.363,I look forward to working with all of you and with the public on these particular issues and again to make sure that we are doing the most that we can to keep people in place during this crisis that has had significant economic impacts and not just to business owners but to workers and of course that has a ripple effect of also Creaing the danger of creating a significant amount of housing and security throughout our communities and exacerbating the Un-Housed crisis which is of course something we do not want to see occur is the results of this crisis.,42,,
462,0.97,5035.363,5051.212,Is are two easy tools to make sure that we are protecting Renters throughout the city as it directly relates to the Coronavirus economic impact that are being caused throughout our community.,42,,
463,0.97,5051.212,5074.135,Also want to say I have been receiving some very disturbing communications from individuals . Renters who have been receiving notices from their landlords for exam that provide a list of places that are hiring and encouraging them to get a job and reminding them that the rent is due at the end of the month.,42,,
464,0.97,5074.135,5091.052,That kind of behavior is exactly why I believe these ordinances are needed and that we will serve the better purpose of protecting tenants throughout our city and with significant financial uncertainty for them.,42,,
465,0.97,5091.052,5101.396,I'm happy to answer any questions or interesting comments.,42,,
466,0.97,5112.607,5124.152,We will move along with the last report if there is no other business we will go ahead and conclude today's agenda.,43,,
467,0.97,5124.152,5129.19,Any other business?,43,,
468,0.97,5129.19,5131.659,"Hearing none, the Council briefing is now a giant.",43,,
469,0.97,5131.659,5134.662,Things everyone and we will see you at 2:00.,43,,
470,0.97,5134.662,5136.564,Thank you.,44,,
