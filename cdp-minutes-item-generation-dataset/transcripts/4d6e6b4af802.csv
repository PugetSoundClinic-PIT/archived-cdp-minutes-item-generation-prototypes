753,0.97,4700.362,4726.354,Thank you so much President Protem we're here discussing my Council bill with Council President Gonzalez as cosponsor to extend the free sidewalk curb space vending and cafe bill to help businesses recover from the economic recession brought on by the Covid pandemic.,206,,
754,0.97,4726.354,4737.299,That requires the bill before us to take the steps that work well releases what didn't work well in the pilot and then makes all of that permanent.,206,,
755,0.97,4737.299,4745.107,This legislation creates that path way to Permanency.,206,,
756,0.97,4745.107,4753.882,Sdot could have spent the last year to do reevaluation on what works and what does not but instead they spent their time approving permits which I applaud.,206,,
757,0.97,4753.882,4761.79,Because of their great work we now have great businesses with these Street permits than before.,206,,
758,0.97,4761.79,4768.663,"When the pandemic hit, forced to shut down and struggled to survive.",206,,

760,0.97,4795.724,4809.571,And the street and sidewalk cafe program gives our businesses the space to use their entrepreneurial spirit to be creative in these outdoor spaces.,206,,
761,0.97,4809.571,4816.011,Recovery will be a long road ahead and we need to continue to support our small businesses in their recovery.,206,,
762,0.97,4816.011,4831.393,As we look toward the permanent program we will need to address how much these permits cost and we also need to hear feed back from all business types to lessen any negative impact and ensure that sidewalks continue to be accessible and navigate.,206,,
763,0.97,4831.393,4835.096,Businesses need certainty and this bill provides that.,206,,
764,0.97,4835.096,4845.24,"We need them to know whatever they build today will be able to last through the next winter through the bad weather, the rain and the cold.",206,,
765,0.97,4845.24,4857.085,This summer before us is actually our first summer with these sidewalk cafe curb permit s and sidewalk streets.,206,,
766,0.97,4857.085,4871.533,I'm very excited to see how businesses use these permits to make our streets more vibrant.,206,,
767,0.97,4871.533,4877.005,In Ballard we used permits for when the farmers market came in.,206,,
768,0.97,4877.005,4879.274,And understand how can we share this space.,206,,
769,0.97,4879.274,4881.109,It is public space after all.,206,,
770,0.97,4881.109,4893.455,And we should be helping support our businesses through the pandemic and we should make sure it's Shareable for everyone.,206,,
771,0.97,4893.455,4903.231,We here at City Council pass the stabilization grant that helps many small businesses in dire moments.,206,,
772,0.97,4903.231,4909.271,By allowing businesses to operate in our streets we provide them a path way to economic recovery.,206,,
773,0.97,4909.271,4913.808,And we should make this path way a permanent feature of our city.,206,,
774,0.97,4913.808,4919.18,In Ballard we're going to have a design for Ballard Avenue.,206,,
775,0.97,4919.18,4924.486,Is unique in and of itself because it cuts off at Ballard Street and market street.,206,,
776,0.97,4924.486,4935.397,What we want to do is create a reputable program so that every neighborhood including the city can have a street dedicated to their small businesses.,206,,
777,0.97,4935.397,4943.939,Through this last year of uncertainty we've continued to plot a path toward equitable recovery.,206,,
778,0.97,4943.939,4945.106,Where businesses need to be successful.,206,,
779,0.97,4945.106,4958.553,"I just wanted to take a moment to thank all of the people that have helped me because again, in this situation, the city of Seattle provided the permits and got out of the way.",206,,
780,0.97,4958.553,4965.961,"Small businesses, their the ones that came out with the design for the Pergulas.",206,,
781,0.97,4965.961,4969.798,They're the ones that created the space.,206,,
782,0.97,4969.798,4972.1,The businesses created more vibrant communities throughout the city.,206,,
783,0.97,4972.1,4976.371,Before I go on and any longer.,206,,
784,0.97,4976.371,4988.65,If Council member Juarez were here she would be telling me to say our thank Yous finally please and let's keep going.,206,,
785,0.97,4988.65,5001.896,"I need to thank Elise Nelson, central staff, Mike Stewart and Reynolds for organizing.",206,,
786,0.97,5001.896,5004.666,Doug Farve for showing how we can share the space.,206,,
787,0.97,5004.666,5015.744,For keeping our focus on all ages and abilities and every single business owner who has used this permit to put forward entrepreneurial spirits to work.,206,,
788,0.97,5015.744,5018.313,Making our city more vibrant.,206,,
789,0.97,5018.313,5030.458,"Just to clarify for colleagues, these permits are permanent and availability as before the pandemic and after the pandemic what this bill before us does is two things.",206,,
790,0.97,5030.458,5035.63,One it extends the free aspect of these permits for a year so that businesses can recover.,206,,
791,0.97,5035.63,5043.438,"The second thing it does is it requests a report from Sdot by December 15, 2021.",206,,
792,0.97,5043.438,5046.808,Explaining what aspects of the current program should remain.,206,,
793,0.97,5046.808,5048.376,Which need to change.,206,,
794,0.97,5048.376,5060.588,And plots a path way forward for us to be able to take up final legislation before this current legislation ends on Memorial day 2022.,206,,
795,0.97,5060.588,5072.033,"So takes again two things ensures these programs are free for another year then Secondly plots the path way forward to Permanency with a deadline of December 15, 2021.",206,,
796,0.97,5072.033,5079.774,To be implemented by May of 2022.,206,,
797,0.97,5079.774,5082.811,Council President Protem that's the committee report.,206,,
798,0.97,5082.811,5087.882,Are there any questions or comments.,207,,
799,0.97,5087.882,5088.416,Council member Pederson.,207,,
800,0.97,5088.416,5094.456,"Thank you for advancing this legislation just to, I think you clarified pretty well.",208,,
801,0.97,5094.456,5100.061,But we would be voting on whether to continue the free permits.,208,,
802,0.97,5100.061,5103.465,Right now it's just through may 2022.,208,,
803,0.97,5103.465,5112.44,So we'll be doing another vote these permits eventually.,208,,
804,0.97,5112.44,5119.747,I just need to be clear because the public space program in Sdot is a fee recovery based program.,208,,
805,0.97,5119.747,5123.618,They have been operating so as to give a lifeline to the small businesses.,208,,
806,0.97,5123.618,5131.893,We need to make sure small businesses have an additional meal free pardon me so they can recover correctly.,208,,
807,0.97,5131.893,5145.807,I'm interested in budget chair Mosqueda to follow up to see if we have money from the American rescue plan available to back fill Sdot because they have been operating at a loss to ensure our small businesses get the support they need.,208,,
808,0.97,5145.807,5158.186,So what we will be voting on next year will be the parameters of a permanent permit and Sdot may very well call me tomorrow and say you won't be voting on that.,208,,
809,0.97,5158.186,5161.456,Because these permits already exist.,208,,
810,0.97,5161.456,5165.994,And so Sdot may just be Tweaking their current programs.,208,,
811,0.97,5165.994,5168.897,Thank you both.,209,,
812,0.97,5168.897,5171.699,Council member Mosqueda.,209,,

815,0.97,5184.679,5190.952,I'm perhaps equally excited or not maybe as excited as the chair but I want to show my enthusiasm for this approach.,210,,
816,0.97,5190.952,5203.298,During this pandemic I know that it's been really important for us that Covid has turned our lives upside down.,210,,
817,0.97,5203.298,5212.473,Especially for small business to be able to respond people to this upheaval and are not able to continue with business as usual.,210,,
818,0.97,5212.473,5216.644,Coronavirus has Layed bare our inequities in many ways.,210,,
819,0.97,5216.644,5224.052,We recognize our local shops are doing everything they can to make it through this very difficult time.,210,,
820,0.97,5224.052,5230.058,Businesses have Anecdotally Poken in favor of these changes.,210,,
821,0.97,5230.058,5232.594,"Indeed, research shows that this is true.",210,,
822,0.97,5232.594,5245.273,Many Brooklyn for example an under utilized parking area was turned into public space for public events increasing the Visibiliy to small businesses there which has been a 172% increase in retail sales.,210,,
823,0.97,5245.273,5252.447,"It's good for patrons, it's good for the business owners and it's good for the health of our local communities as well.",210,,
824,0.97,5252.447,5262.223,Further our Boston study shows creating a seating area out of a curb Lane can increase sales at a front at a front facing business by 14%.,210,,
825,0.97,5262.223,5272.767,I recognize that there's concern from small businesses in certain areas because of loss of parking.,210,,
826,0.97,5272.767,5276.571,And we can help mitigate those concerns.,210,,
827,0.97,5276.571,5281.009,While creating lasting positive impacts for businesses and do what the data has shown.,210,,
828,0.97,5281.009,5287.315,Actually increase sales for small businesses as we decrease the need for cars and parking spaces around our city as well.,210,,
829,0.97,5287.315,5290.451,We look forward to being able to vote yes for this.,210,,
830,0.97,5290.451,5293.755,I really appreciate the sponsors work on this.,210,,
831,0.97,5293.755,5311.973,And I duly heard you on the desire to make sure that we're also looking at the cost needs for Sdot related to potential Úthat issues that are coming up with this Ordnance and we'll look forward to discussing those related conversations over the next six weeks here.,210,,
832,0.97,5311.973,5317.245,Appreciate it Council members and looking forward to this.,210,,

835,0.97,5331.359,5337.165,She brought me the idea because of her desire to make this permanent program.,213,,
836,0.97,5337.165,5349.01,"I wanted to say to our colleagues I could not have thought of this legislation without Council member Gonzalez, her husband's perspective is well valued.",213,,
837,0.97,5349.01,5354.682,So wanted to take this moment to highlight that we couldn't have done it without you Council President.,213,,

900,0.97,5581.008,5587.181,Thank you President Protem Herbold appreciate this opportunity.,254,,
901,0.97,5587.181,5609.77,Earlier today I circulated a draft of this to Council members denouncing the brutal Israeli atrocities demanding that the Biden administration condemn the policies of the Israeli state and that Biden and the U.S. Congress cut off military aid and weapons sales to the Israeli state and demand that they are released immediately to a cease-fire.,254,,
902,0.97,5609.77,5624.518,As people in public comment pointed out the Biden administration has just days ago approved $735 million worth of new precision guided weapons to Israel.,254,,
903,0.97,5624.518,5634.528,Since last night our office and other city council offices have received calls from community leaders to sign on to the statement.,254,,
904,0.97,5634.528,5638.899,And dozens of people signed up and spoke in public comment today.,254,,
905,0.97,5638.899,5641.202,In such a short time frame.,254,,
906,0.97,5641.202,5651.512,This is a show of the community support for the Palestinian people and against the brutal violence and the apartheid regime by the Israeli government.,254,,
907,0.97,5651.512,5656.684,The Palestinians in Jerusalem and the people of Gaza did not start this current conflict.,254,,
908,0.97,5656.684,5660.021,The Benjamin Netanyahu regime has done that.,254,,
909,0.97,5660.021,5672.299,First with their provocative attempt to Evict Palestinian families from their homes and the armed conflict assault on Muslim Worshipers at Jerusalems Mosque.,254,,
910,0.97,5672.299,5679.874,Second and not least with the daily organized violence against the Palestinians by the Israeli government and by far right settlers.,254,,
911,0.97,5679.874,5698.459,"Thus the current military assault comes on top of the ongoing Palestinian struggle to survive under conditions of the pandemic, or poverty and unemployment and misery.",254,,
912,0.97,5698.459,5707.568,"Including extensive demolition of homes and in the case of Gaza, a brutal blockade for a decade and a half.",254,,
913,0.97,5707.568,5716.377,The conditions in Gaza even before the President assault were described by the United Nations as quote Unquote unlivable.,254,,
914,0.97,5716.377,5725.286,"Let's be clear, Palestinians should have a right to protest and to organize and defend themselves.",254,,
915,0.97,5725.286,5746.474,"Yes we oppose indiscriminate firing of rockets in Israel as Congress member Sawant says no child, Palestinian or Israeli.",254,,
916,0.97,5746.474,5761.155,"Palestinian and Jewish people have been killed by bombings and military attacks, that's horrific.",254,,
917,0.97,5761.155,5765.526,Some Council members have expressed interest in the letter which I greatly appreciate.,254,,
918,0.97,5765.526,5773.033,But in the morning there was a discussion about having more time to determine if they could sign or not sign on to it.,254,,
919,0.97,5773.033,5805.099,"And as I had indicated in the morning I would have been opened to wait but I think given the urgency many community members have justifiably expressed just minutes ago, I would strongly urge Council members to express their support today through the role come as Council Herbold expressed the since this morning.",254,,
920,0.97,5805.099,5806.734,We cannot wait any longer.,254,,
921,0.97,5806.734,5819.513,The citations will strengthen the statement by demonstrating the wide and global incentives and the evidence of and the factual bases.,254,,
922,0.97,5819.513,5833.093,Whether they stand on this statement with the understanding that we will add the citations and any other copy before sending the statement to President Biden and the U.S. Congress.,254,,
923,0.97,5833.093,5841.402,Need less to say I would oppose watering down of the statements with blaming Kwoets Unquote both side for the current violence.,254,,
924,0.97,5841.402,5854.782,That's exactly what we need to take the stand against.,254,,
925,0.97,5857.418,5861.822,For the Falacial statement that we know Worldwides that what's happening.,254,,
926,0.97,5861.822,5881.375,"As we said before, we condemn the killing of any civilian whether it's Israeli or Palestinian, young or old.",254,,
927,0.97,5881.375,5889.016,A budget by far right Israeli outside the Mosque.,254,,
928,0.97,5889.016,5902.463,"I wanted to quote quickly from the statement that this, that we are discussing here quote the continued occupation and oppression of the Palestinian people has been funded and facilitated by the United States government.",254,,
929,0.97,5902.463,5913.274,It has been part of a long term policy of U.S. imperialism to support apartheid.,254,,
930,0.97,5913.274,5918.979,Successful administrations have attempted to portray themselves as honest the backers of peace.,254,,
931,0.97,5918.979,5925.552,But have blocked peace both democratically and by providing aid.,254,,
932,0.97,5925.552,5933.894,"Ocasio Cortez, Clyde and other members of the squad speaking out against the attacks on Gaza.",254,,
933,0.97,5933.894,5949.743,"We agree with Congress member Ocasio-Cortez when she said, the U.S. must acknowledge the right of Palestinians.",254,,
934,0.97,5949.743,5957.484,Israel has a right to defend themselves but do the Israelis have the right to survive?,254,,
935,0.97,5957.484,5967.895,Most importantly we call on you to cut off all military aid and all Wáep sales to Israel and stop providing diplomatic cover for those brutal policies of the Israeli state.,254,,
936,0.97,5967.895,5972.266,Protests are growing in the United States and globally.,254,,
937,0.97,5972.266,5977.137,"4,000 people protested outside the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles on Saturday.",254,,

942,0.97,6003.931,6012.172,The United States government must its disastrous position and re retract all support being carried out.,254,,
943,0.97,6012.172,6022.816,I want to thank the dozens of community members and the organizations who work on developing the statement including activists from the United States and also in Israel.,254,,
944,0.97,6022.816,6030.691,Thank you especially for the support from this statement from the community Alliance for global justice.,254,,

948,0.97,6051.945,6061.889,Ordinarily I would be open to waiting but I feel like in this case it is called upon us our community members have called upon us to urgently work on this.,254,,
949,0.97,6061.889,6066.46,And that the situation could get worse and so we cannot wait for that to happen.,254,,
950,0.97,6066.46,6091.919,"I want to also in closing, we want to make sure the community members know that I've asked central staff to begin drafting legislation to prohibit Seattle from engaging with the police forces, intelligence agencies, security services, or other armed forces of any country with the consistent pattern of human rights including but not limited to Israel.",254,,
951,0.97,6091.919,6099.092,The Seattle police Department Unfortunately has track record going back in the early 20 years of having its officers attend training.,254,,
952,0.97,6099.092,6103.564,Either by the Israeli military or police or its proxies.,254,,
953,0.97,6103.564,6113.907,"Elsewhere around the country, Jewish voice for peace and ally organizations have won resolutions banning what they call the deadly exchanges.",254,,
954,0.97,6113.907,6121.181,And consultation with local activists in the deadly exchange movement I will be bringing forward legislation to do the same here in Seattle.,254,,
955,0.97,6121.181,6132.793,Given the brutal ongoing attacks on the Palestinian people this is the very least our city should do and I would really welcome other Council members who wish to work on this with my office.,254,,
956,0.97,6132.793,6135.696,Thank you so much.,254,,
957,0.97,6135.696,6138.866,Thank you Council member Sawant.,255,,
958,0.97,6138.866,6140.834,Council member Strauss.,255,,
959,0.97,6140.834,6141.969,Thank you.,256,,
960,0.97,6141.969,6142.669,President Protem.,256,,
961,0.97,6142.669,6145.873,Council member Sawant I understand your desire and need to move quickly.,256,,
962,0.97,6145.873,6150.277,I cannot today sign on to your letter as currently written.,256,,
963,0.97,6150.277,6167.728,I do have added some suggestions I would like to send you if you were able to wait another week I would be happy to sign on should those Edits and amendments be taken on.,256,,
964,0.97,6167.728,6180.34,Thank you Ma'am President Protem and Council member Sawant I appreciate you bringing this letter forward.,257,,
965,0.97,6180.34,6190.45,Your concerns are ones I echo deeply having Palestinian friends.,257,,
966,0.97,6190.45,6196.456,Not having a lot of time to review this letter I think we should take a little more time to deliberate.,257,,
967,0.97,6196.456,6203.997,I just received an updated letter about 25 minutes ago that I guess Manifests some of Council member Mosqueda's feed back.,257,,
968,0.97,6203.997,6216.176,I briefly skimmed through it during your comments and it looks like it's just the addition of some citations but it would be useful to have some time to review those.,257,,
969,0.97,6216.176,6219.146,There's some revisions the letter would benefit from.,257,,
970,0.97,6219.146,6250.444,Including citing an effort that has been coming together over the last 24 hours for a group of 29 Democratic senators including Senator Patty Murray who have officially come forward and called for a Cease- fire to be negotiated which is something of course that the official Biden administration State Department has not yet done so there are some efforts that we could reference in support in the body of the letter.,257,,
971,0.97,6250.444,6265.993,And give some support Additionally for members of our delegation here who are supporting some of these efforts toward negotiating a peaceful settlement.,257,,
972,0.97,6265.993,6276.77,I think the letter would benefit from a little bit more of those additions and I just wanted to throw that out there given that the letter is not circulated until this morning and a new draft of the letter was circulated just a few minutes ago.,257,,
973,0.97,6276.77,6280.674,I think I have a similar position than Council member Strauss.,257,,
974,0.97,6280.674,6298.292,I think it's important that we weigh in and instruct our congressional legislation that we as a city would like them to proceed in pressuring the Federal administration.,257,,
975,0.97,6298.292,6318.278,But in its current form I don't think this letter accomplishes.,257,,
976,0.97,6318.278,6342.869,Ill would join Council member Strauss' request to hold the letter and make it more to the Council.,257,,
977,0.97,6342.869,6354.981,I thank you for your letter and we send our condolences to those who have been killed and wounded in Gaza.,258,,
978,0.97,6354.981,6362.522,Reporting on the violence and a refugee camp.,258,,
979,0.97,6362.522,6373.567,And the silence from President Biden is Deafening.,258,,
980,0.97,6373.567,6396.223,Over the weekend with public communication.,258,,
981,0.97,6396.223,6402.629,And we got the letter and incorporate references that we have indicated we have not seen a final version of the letter.,258,,
982,0.97,6402.629,6404.631,This letter can respect members of this body.,258,,
983,0.97,6404.631,6408.668,We must be given an opportunity to review and provide our input.,258,,
984,0.97,6408.668,6415.475,We each have content we would like to contribute as well as our own tone in style.,258,,
985,0.97,6415.475,6449.142,For instance the letter references statements from the squad but it does not reference our own representative statements.,258,,
986,0.97,6449.142,6452.846,And my office replied asking if government relations had seen the letter.,258,,
987,0.97,6452.846,6456.516,We had not received response to that request.,258,,
988,0.97,6456.516,6459.619,They had the opportunity to provide thoughtful feed back.,258,,
989,0.97,6459.619,6463.99,"As mentioned earlier, I request more time of Council member Sawant this morning.",258,,
990,0.97,6463.99,6469.896,I was told at that time that might be possible.,258,,
991,0.97,6469.896,6480.907,"After public comment, council member Sawant contacted me and says she is not giving this additional time because of testimony today.",258,,
992,0.97,6480.907,6492.152,I feel testimony that Council member Sawant's office has mobilized.,258,,
993,0.97,6492.152,6495.622,So these are conditions of her creation.,258,,
994,0.97,6495.622,6495.989,Of her office.,258,,
995,0.97,6495.989,6497.157,Of their good work.,258,,
996,0.97,6497.157,6505.532,"Seems that somebody who would like to sign this letter, this is unfair.",258,,
997,0.97,6505.532,6512.205,In addition to sharing meeting I've been on accountable issue and following up on discussion.,258,,
998,0.97,6512.205,6532.292,And I also had another meeting about a piece of legislation that is being heard in Council member Mosqueda tomorrow.,258,,
999,0.97,6532.292,6533.293,5:00 P.M.,258,,
1000,0.97,6533.293,6543.904,"On Friday the previous week to the Monday that it will be heard, and again the references to allow for Council member review.",258,,
1001,0.97,6543.904,6558.084,So sort of in that spirit certainly seems to me that it would be fair to give us more than a few hours of time to review the letter and provide our input.,258,,
1002,0.97,6558.084,6561.021,Those are my thoughts.,258,,
1003,0.97,6561.021,6562.422,Council member Strauss you had additional comment.,258,,
1004,0.97,6562.422,6577.404,I thought I was Teeing up a question for Council member Sawant and then we kind of went into that whole.,259,,
1005,0.97,6577.404,6577.637,Round.,259,,
1006,0.97,6577.637,6578.538,I have a 4:00 meeting.,259,,
1007,0.97,6578.538,6581.508,I am in short time at this moment.,259,,
1008,0.97,6581.508,6586.913,Council member Sawant would you be interested in accepting some additional Edits.,259,,
1009,0.97,6586.913,6595.021,"One in particular is, the United Nations let me get the name correctly.",259,,
1010,0.97,6595.021,6620.947,United nation relief and works agency in the near East we haven't considered any of their important work in the conversation.,259,,
1011,0.97,6620.947,6622.749,I'm sorry I don't understand the question.,260,,
1012,0.97,6622.749,6624.317,Can we wait a week.,261,,
1013,0.97,6624.317,6628.355,I cannot raise my hand and comment to the discussion.,262,,
1014,0.97,6628.355,6632.959,We're putting this all on the table because we're working in a tight time space.,263,,
1015,0.97,6632.959,6634.194,I have a 4:00 P.M.,263,,
1016,0.97,6634.194,6636.196,Appointment that I have to make.,263,,
1017,0.97,6636.196,6638.198,I have substantive.,263,,
1018,0.97,6638.198,6641.768,I don't think they're substantive Edits but I do have Edits for you.,263,,
1019,0.97,6641.768,6650.877,I would like to sign on to this letter but would need to have these Edits to feel comfortable.,263,,
1020,0.97,6650.877,6662.489,Would you be able to wait a week and review my Edits so that I can know if I can sign on.,263,,
1021,0.97,6662.489,6665.892,President Protem Herbold would you like me to respond to the comments now.,264,,
1022,0.97,6665.892,6673.333,I thought I heard you already answer the question of whether or not we could wait a week.,265,,
1023,0.97,6673.333,6679.406,I didn't realize Council member Strauss you were asking a question that had not already been answered.,265,,
1024,0.97,6679.406,6681.474,"But by all means, council member Sawant.",265,,
1025,0.97,6681.474,6681.841,Thank you.,266,,
1026,0.97,6681.841,6689.816,"Yes as I had said this morning and also a few minutes ago, I totally appreciate that Council members need time.",266,,
1027,0.97,6689.816,6700.16,My intention is not to do it in any rushed manner and I did not President Herbold create the conditions in reality.,266,,
1028,0.97,6700.16,6705.165,"I am, quite impressed by community members passionate on this issue.",266,,
1029,0.97,6705.165,6708.134,It's not like I make them passionate about this issue.,266,,
1030,0.97,6708.134,6714.641,This shows how much support there is to urgently address the extremely horrific situation that the Palestinian people are under.,266,,
1031,0.97,6714.641,6737.664,"Yes I did reach out to people but it's the people themselves who have decided that this is an issue important enough for them to testify in public comment in such great numbers and with such, such an intensity which I think is correctly warranted given the scale of the violence that is going on in Israel.",266,,
1032,0.97,6737.664,6739.499,And given that strength that was expressed today.,266,,
1033,0.97,6739.499,6743.336,And also to be honest with you.,266,,
1034,0.97,6743.336,6751.01,"In the protest yesterday, I felt obligated by myself, I'm not saying that other, all elected officials should feel this same way I do.",266,,
1035,0.97,6751.01,6762.388,"But I feel obligated that for my office, there's a great sense of urgency that is now magnified given what I've heard from community members which I didn't say, I didn't tell them what to say.",266,,
1036,0.97,6762.388,6765.592,They said what was on their minds.,266,,
1037,0.97,6765.592,6786.312,"So from that standpoint I feel like the way to proceed here is for the letter to go in its current form just from my office but also in addition to that, I am extremely interested and I would really be gratified I we as a council were to have our letter also.",266,,
1038,0.97,6786.312,6788.548,So what I was going to suggest.,266,,
1039,0.97,6788.548,6790.85,We don't do the roll call on the letter today.,266,,
1040,0.97,6790.85,6818.478,I will send the letter from my office but at the same time I want to continue working with all offices to see if we can send an additional letter in an edited form with many of the Edits incorporated in order to send it next Monday with a roll call and I'm happy to work with Council member Strauss of course Council member Mosqueda which who I've already been discussing.,266,,
1041,0.97,6818.478,6819.979,Council President Protem Herbold.,266,,
1042,0.97,6819.979,6823.55,I am happy to include their citations.,266,,
1043,0.97,6823.55,6836.062,But I don't want to make it seem as if the Palestinian people and the Israeli state are on equal ground and somehow obscuring the fact the Israeli regime and the U.S.,266,,
1044,0.97,6836.062,6841.134,Administration support for the Israeli regime is what is causing this crisis.,266,,
1045,0.97,6841.134,6842.969,With that understanding.,266,,
1046,0.97,6842.969,6846.873,I absolutely want to work on a letter that the Council can send next week.,266,,
1047,0.97,6846.873,6873.399,But in the mean while as I said to Council members I would prefer that at least this letter just from my office go and also I wanted to point out that the reason the new draft was circulated just 25 minutes ago is not because it was half hazard.,266,,
1048,0.97,6873.399,6878.938,It was because my office was trying to include as many Edits as possible.,266,,
1049,0.97,6878.938,6883.209,"Until the very early morning hours, and I was working on this all last night.",266,,
1050,0.97,6883.209,6886.613,We were trying to include comment from Council members.,266,,
1051,0.97,6886.613,6889.148,Which I think are very important.,266,,
1052,0.97,6889.148,6891.751,"These are very crucial issues, opinions are very strong.",266,,
1053,0.97,6891.751,6903.763,We all wanted to make sure we were consulting a whole group of community organizations and also labor unions to make sure that they felt the statement represented how they felt about the situation.,266,,
1054,0.97,6903.763,6908.368,I don't agree that this letter does not powerfully Express what needs to be said in the moment.,266,,
1055,0.97,6908.368,6928.421,"And in reality, the letter is not very long and the concrete points in the letter are reflecting the as I said before, it's reflecting the broad consensus on what's happening.",266,,
1056,0.97,6928.421,6935.762,Not what my opinion but it respects the consensus form.,266,,
1057,0.97,6935.762,6937.597,That they withdrawal military weapons and support.,266,,
1058,0.97,6937.597,6940.133,That's what the letter says and I don't think in that sense.,266,,
1059,0.97,6940.133,6951.21,If we're to take the correct position as history demands that's not a controversy controversial point in my view.,266,,
1060,0.97,6951.21,6958.251,And the reason I wanted to stop the delay is because Palestinians were being killed by weapons provided by the United States.,266,,
1061,0.97,6958.251,6964.057,I've heard from people who have been in touch with people from Palestine who have been saying please do not delay this.,266,,
1062,0.97,6964.057,6967.226,That was the position I was representing.,266,,
1063,0.97,6967.226,6981.641,In conclusion I would be happy to work with the Council for a letter that goes from all of the Council but I do want to send this letter from my office because I feel like sending something from the city council offices today is crucial.,266,,
1064,0.97,6981.641,6981.941,Thank you.,266,,
