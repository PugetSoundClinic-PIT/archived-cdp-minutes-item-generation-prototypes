18,0.97,105.038,108.241,"We're going to start off, as always with public comment.",8,,
19,0.97,108.241,113.78,Can I ask if we have anyone signed up for public comment?,8,,

26,0.97,136.769,143.61,I'm going to call on each Speaker by name and in the order in which they registered on the Council's Website.,10,,

28,0.97,156.923,158.057,Press Star 6 to begin speaking.,10,,
29,0.97,158.057,163.096,So with that I am going to hand it over to our first speaker.,10,,
30,0.97,163.096,166.666,Who is our first Speaker who has signed up today?,10,,
31,0.97,166.666,170.47,The first and only caller Online is David Hanes.,11,,
32,0.97,170.47,176.609,"David Hanes, you have two minutes and are recognized.",12,,
33,0.97,176.609,178.611,"Hi, thank you.",13,,
34,0.97,178.611,197.83,"David Hanes, District 7. after seeing the article in the newspaper today, it's obvious that we need an investigation of the service providers who he repeatedly get RAISES while never bothering to show up for work, while government acts like they were successful getting through another winter, patting themselves on the back for a few days of work.",13,,
35,0.97,197.83,209.676,Yet recently it wept below freezing with lack of shelter while corrupt Nonprofits don't even have proper buildings designed to provide proper shelters.,13,,
36,0.97,209.676,221.754,"It's obvious Democrats spread social welfare money to help the local economy and their big donors and owners of rundown, obsolete flawed real estate ill suited for the task at hand.",13,,
37,0.97,221.754,232.932,"As Nonprofits are padding the cost, financing their own rundown Remortgaged real estate, using homeless for a lifelong career, tainted with Skin-Colored discrimination.",13,,
38,0.97,232.932,261.561,Why is city council refusing to solve the homeless crisis going on a third winter of Covid while reports of failure and Prioritizing repeat offenders who aren't making real effort has proven they are only helping certain people would bother others and yet get priority over innocent for seen homeless Racistly discriminated against based on skin color priority inside racist City Hall and office of housing policy.,13,,
39,0.97,261.561,262.295,"Admit it, council.",13,,
40,0.97,262.295,274.574,The only thing you've managed to ensure is buying off the activist organizers and protesters hiding within the Nonprofits who trade election support as long as they never get Jut United States or investigated.,13,,
41,0.97,274.574,304.871,"I think 178 people signed up to help with the last winter storm shelter, yet only something like 18 showed up, wail the same people are guaranteed RAISES each year who are on record as complaining they don't want to solve the crisis of innocent homeless suffering because they're worried they won't have a job so they purposely don't make a real effort, cheating innocent citizens and taxpayers who still run interference for drug pushers committing crimes against humanity.",13,,
42,0.97,304.871,305.905,Thank you.,14,,
43,0.97,305.905,306.673,Your time has expired.,14,,
44,0.97,306.673,310.343,Do we have another person signed in now?,14,,
45,0.97,310.343,311.144,Yes.,15,,
46,0.97,311.144,312.078,I see Alexander.,16,,
47,0.97,312.078,316.115,The second caller is signed in.,17,,
48,0.97,316.115,317.383,Excellent.,18,,
49,0.97,317.383,319.786,And is that Alexander Lomas?,18,,
50,0.97,319.786,320.787,That is correct.,19,,
51,0.97,320.787,322.021,Okay.,20,,
52,0.97,322.021,331.364,"Alexander, you are recognized for two minutes, and once you hear the Chime, hit Star 6 and you have two minutes.",20,,
53,0.97,331.364,332.065,All right.,21,,
54,0.97,332.065,332.565,Hi.,21,,
55,0.97,332.565,337.537,So I'd like to comment on the agenda item about the parking permits.,21,,
56,0.97,337.537,370.636,"Essential all I want to say is that if the parking permits do cost money and for that fee to be as low as possible for it to Runny efficiently, and if there are any profits that are derived from the administration of these permits, I would like to implore the committee to use that money to develop, or further develop the park system in the Seattle area, specifically focusing on those in Underserved communities especially.",21,,
57,0.97,370.636,403.269,"I think that by doing--by kind of having this process you can have a pretty Self- sufficient income that's able to help support our Underserved park system and over time as these Underserved parks become better facilitated and better upkeep generally, those spaces could also be Privy to people wanting to start their businesses within those areas and start developing those areas even further which can help build greater community bonds.",21,,
58,0.97,403.269,417.083,So I definitely think that this permit system is a great opportunity for Seattle parks and is a great opportunity for all of Seattle as our parks are some of our most important public spaces.,21,,
59,0.97,417.083,423.055,I'd really like to see them further developed and supported.,21,,
60,0.97,423.055,425.792,"With that, I Ce Derkz the rest of my time.",21,,
61,0.97,425.792,426.058,Okay.,22,,
62,0.97,426.058,435.568,And with that we will close the public comment session and move on to items of business.,22,,
63,0.97,435.568,442.308,"Item number 1, Mr. clerk will you please read the item into the record.",22,,
64,0.97,442.308,470.77,"Item number 1, council bill 120264, an ordinance relating to permits in parks, stating a maximum term for permits in parks, clarifying the nature of permissible commercial activities in parks, and amending sections 18.12.030, 18.12.042, and 18.12.160 of the Seattle municipal code.",23,,
65,0.97,470.77,471.103,Excellent.,24,,
66,0.97,471.103,481.814,"Before we begin the presentation on this proposed ordinance a, can we do a quick round of introduction from our parks Department Presenters.",24,,
67,0.97,481.814,482.081,Great.,25,,
68,0.97,482.081,483.182,Maybe I'll start.,25,,
69,0.97,483.182,491.357,"I'm Christopher Williams, acting superintendent, Seattle parks.",25,,
70,0.97,491.357,504.303,"Amy Hamaker, Seattle parks & amp; recreation, and I'm a parks concession coordinator.",26,,
71,0.97,504.303,504.604,Joanne.,27,,
72,0.97,504.604,508.207,"Joanne Rusucci, Seattle parks & amp; recreation.",28,,
73,0.97,508.207,508.507,Donnie.,29,,
74,0.97,508.507,514.947,"I'm Donnie grew bow ski, Finance and administration director for parks & amp; recreation.",30,,
75,0.97,514.947,519.151,Thank you all for joining us this afternoon.,31,,
76,0.97,519.151,523.923,"Interim director Williams, should I turn it over to you to begin the presentation?",31,,
77,0.97,523.923,533.132,"Thank you, and thank you for getting this on the agenda today, and happy new year to all the Council members here.",32,,
78,0.97,533.132,538.571,So section 18.12 of the SNC is known as the park code.,32,,
79,0.97,538.571,542.642,This is where rules governing various behaviors and public parks are covered.,32,,
80,0.97,542.642,550.316,We are here today to propose changes intended to clarify rules related to commercial activity in parks.,32,,
81,0.97,550.316,564.53,"On one hand, we have initiative 42 that expressly prohibits commercial activity in parks except where expressly author Rinds writing by the superintendent of parks, or his Designee or her Designee.",32,,
82,0.97,564.53,573.372,Seattle parks & amp; recreation is proposing changes to the Seattle municipal code as it relates to commercial use.,32,,
83,0.97,573.372,592.658,The intent of these changes is to provide clearer language matching--rather matching with existing concession policies and procedures and then continuing to allow park activation that's consistent with our values.,32,,
84,0.97,592.658,609.008,"And I think all of this, to the extent that vending is and commercial activity in parks has a direct benefit to park users I think is what we are trying to accomplish here.",32,,
85,0.97,609.008,617.45,I will also note that revenues from vending and concessions contribute significantly to the overall park budget.,32,,
86,0.97,617.45,631.263,"So at this time I'd like to ask Amy Hamaker on our staff who has done a great job working on this issue, to come forward and lead you in a presentation.",32,,
87,0.97,631.263,637.403,"Thank so you are very much, Christopher, and thank you, Council members, for your time today.",33,,
88,0.97,637.403,642.541,"I'm sorry, I cannot share my Video because it impact my bandwidth.",33,,
89,0.97,642.541,646.679,"I'm keeping it off for now, and I apologize for.",33,,
90,0.97,646.679,654.687,So we're here today to address three sections of the Seattle municipal code as it relates to commercial activities in parks.,33,,
91,0.97,654.687,660.159,So today I'll provide with you a little bit of background about vending Unparks.,33,,
92,0.97,660.159,663.963,"I'll explain the proposed changes and why they are necessary, and I'll answer any questions that you might have.",33,,
93,0.97,663.963,674.874,"And so if you take a look at the slide, you can see from the photos this represents some of the diverse commercial activity that you might find in parks.",33,,
94,0.97,674.874,677.51,"Next slide, please.",33,,
95,0.97,677.51,688.087,"So for many years, Seattle parks & amp; recreation has activated parks and enhanced park Goers' experience through the seasonal concession permitting program.",33,,
96,0.97,688.087,692.525,So we issue short-term concession use permits through a competitive Rfp process.,33,,
97,0.97,692.525,698.798,So we open in that January every year and run it for about Tbhonts for people to apply.,33,,
98,0.97,698.798,702.701,We're looking for interesting business Collaborations that compliment and enhance parks.,33,,
99,0.97,702.701,707.339,We do have set criteria for what is allowed and where it is allowed.,33,,
100,0.97,707.339,713.779,"So what we're really trying to do with our concession permitting program is match park values, avoid conflicting use of space.",33,,
101,0.97,713.779,723.656,You can see he from the slide that 80% of our seasonal concession vendors Self- identify as Wmbe.,33,,
102,0.97,723.656,724.89,Number has remained consistent five years.,33,,
103,0.97,724.89,730.396,One of the positive outcomes is is we do provide opportunities to small business owners.,33,,
104,0.97,730.396,737.57,"We reach out, we conduct outreach to community Blogs, social media, and word of mouth is very powerful.",33,,
105,0.97,737.57,746.245,"We have flyers that we send to libraries to be posted at community center, and we also work with our colleagues and other city departments.",33,,
106,0.97,746.245,748.247,"Next slide, please.",33,,
107,0.97,748.247,758.424,So I just want to share with you three pilot programs that we have done to try to activate underutilized parks.,33,,
108,0.97,758.424,772.605,"Last year in 2021 be had fee waivers at South Park Plaza, a park that's in preconstruction planning so we had fee waivers for two food and market vendors.",33,,
109,0.97,772.605,777.276,They activated the space in a positive manner.,33,,
110,0.97,777.276,778.811,"Secondly, mobile vending in Southeast Seattle.",33,,
111,0.97,778.811,793.959,"The purpose was, we have some parks in Southeast Seattle that for some reason people aren't bidding on through our request for proposal process, and there aren't necessarily I am men Tees nearby so we're trying to had a vendors to those particular locations.",33,,
112,0.97,793.959,795.427,And then the third pilot program --,33,,
113,0.97,795.427,800.566,Can I jump in for just one moment?,34,,
114,0.97,800.566,801.6,Councilmember Herbold has a question.,34,,
115,0.97,801.6,810.109,I realized at the beginning of the presentation I didn't indicate would my preference would be to accommodated questions during the presentation.,34,,
116,0.97,810.109,821.053,"Maybe I would just ask Councilmember Herbold, is it a question germane to something in a recent slide that would be good to address at this time, or could it wait until the end of the presentation?",34,,
117,0.97,821.053,824.99,Just real quickly it is about information on this slide.,35,,
118,0.97,824.99,835.067,Just wondering whether or not the fee waiver for the community food and market vendors at South park are planned to be continued for 2022.,35,,
119,0.97,835.067,835.301,Thanks.,35,,
120,0.97,835.301,838.504,That's actually a really good question.,36,,
121,0.97,838.504,842.408,"Actually, the construction at South Park Plaza is scheduled to begin next month.",36,,
122,0.97,842.408,848.814,So we're not going to have activation there during the construction phase of the parks.,36,,
123,0.97,848.814,853.619,"However, we're always looking to do fee waivers or activation at other parks.",36,,
124,0.97,853.619,859.391,So it's possible in 2022 we might look at a different location.,36,,
125,0.97,859.391,866.298,"Pritchard Beach is one example where we're usually trying to place somebody, so we might try to do a fee waiver program there.",36,,
126,0.97,866.298,866.599,Thanks.,37,,
127,0.97,866.599,880.913,"But with the construction at South Park Plaza and also the closure of the community center in South Park, it's just gathering places are at a premium, and there aren't very many.",37,,
128,0.97,880.913,891.79,So to the extent that we could work to try to create more of those opportunities for folks to gather.,37,,
129,0.97,891.79,893.459,Really great point.,38,,
130,0.97,893.459,915.314,"And I have to really shout out to the vendors we had at South Park this last year because they take a risk by coming in, by trying something new in an area that didn't have the park itself was pretty basic and bare, so they took a risk by showing up.",38,,
131,0.97,915.314,919.985,"Yes, definitely.",38,,
132,0.97,919.985,920.786,So next slide.,38,,
133,0.97,920.786,921.086,All right.,38,,
134,0.97,921.086,929.495,So I just wanted to highlight three vendors that reflect different types of permitted commercial activity in the parks throughout the city.,38,,
135,0.97,929.495,934.9,These are vendors that provide amenities consistent with park values.,38,,
136,0.97,934.9,936.535,"So on the left, you see Latoya.",38,,
137,0.97,936.535,941.941,She came to us a few years ago with this #Kwr-D of operating a mobile ice cream vehicle.,38,,
138,0.97,941.941,952.484,"And so we worked with her, and she identified Seward Park, it's her community, her neighborhood so he she applied through the request for a proposal and received a permit.",38,,
139,0.97,952.484,954.253,She's been a great addition.,38,,
140,0.97,954.253,957.323,She is very engaged in the community.,38,,
141,0.97,957.323,959.325,"In the middle, you see Saring Mike.",38,,
142,0.97,959.325,965.597,He is actually one of the first people to apply for a permit to operate fitness class in the park.,38,,
143,0.97,965.597,968.801,So this was many years ago.,38,,
144,0.97,968.801,973.906,And he really took pride in kind of being a steward in the park.,38,,
145,0.97,973.906,977.009,"He made Relationsships with grounds and maintenance, really positive early morning presence.",38,,
146,0.97,977.009,982.648,"If he saw a light out or a problem, he would notify park staff.",38,,
147,0.97,982.648,986.585,And then on the right is priest wick who operates at Magnuson park.,38,,
148,0.97,986.585,990.856,If you have been to arena sports you may have noticed his food truck outside there.,38,,
149,0.97,990.856,992.691,He's very well-known in the community.,38,,
150,0.97,992.691,1007.306,"What I would like to see about him, before the pandemic if there was an event at Magnuson people would reach out to me and say, can I get priest wick's information?",38,,
151,0.97,1007.306,1009.475,I think people associate him with Magnuson park.,38,,
152,0.97,1009.475,1016.815,These are just a few examples of the vendors we've worked with over the years.,38,,
153,0.97,1016.815,1017.149,Next slide.,38,,
154,0.97,1017.149,1022.521,We're requesting three changes to the municipal code.,38,,
155,0.97,1022.521,1026.892,"Number one, section 18.12.30 is we're adding a definition of commercial activity.",38,,
156,0.97,1026.892,1032.698,We don't currently have that definition in the code.,38,,
157,0.97,1032.698,1039.671,"Section 18.12.42, permit system, we have existing language that States that a permit is required for commercial activity.",38,,
158,0.97,1039.671,1047.179,"We're just adding clarifying language that would include a service, product, or activity.",38,,
159,0.97,1047.179,1057.589,We've also added some language that permits may be issued for up to a year because the purpose of the short-term vending program is to create opportunities.,38,,
160,0.97,1057.589,1061.927,We expect people to apply yearly through the request for proposal process.,38,,
161,0.97,1061.927,1067.8,We don't want them to come and say I want to be at Magnuson for two years.,38,,
162,0.97,1067.8,1068.901,It's really an open process.,38,,
163,0.97,1068.901,1075.774,Most of the people applying are applying for the seasonal months of Memorial day through labor day.,38,,
164,0.97,1075.774,1087.786,"And then the last change, 18.12.160, we're just updating the language to be consistent with the definition and also 18.12.42.",38,,
165,0.97,1087.786,1095.661,"If you see the current code, it's titled sales of merchandise, concession contract require.",38,,
166,0.97,1095.661,1109.842,"We're removing some unclear language in there about rights, privilege, tangible, or intangible, and updating it to say any commercial activity, which includes a service, product, or activity requires a permit in the park.",38,,
167,0.97,1109.842,1113.946,So next slide.,38,,
168,0.97,1113.946,1116.281,So why are the changes needed?,38,,
169,0.97,1116.281,1119.885,Why are we here today to discuss this?,38,,
170,0.97,1119.885,1137.369,"We feel that these changes will result in Clearerring language, it will match the language with our existing concession policies and procedures, and it will allow us to the to activate parks in a positive manner that you saw from the earlier slides.",38,,
171,0.97,1137.369,1141.94,Interest in vending in Park has really increased over the last ten years.,38,,
172,0.97,1141.94,1146.311,Indeed with the PAP Deemic we've definitely seen more businesses seeking to operate within the park.,38,,
173,0.97,1146.311,1148.213,And the nature of the request has changed.,38,,
174,0.97,1148.213,1155.787,So ten years ago people were asking to have their food truck in the park or vending Kayaks.,38,,
175,0.97,1155.787,1161.627,"Now we're seeing a definite increase in education, nature, art, or fitness classes.",38,,
176,0.97,1161.627,1171.069,"So these code changes really address the changing nature of commercial activity requests and just clarify that includes service, products, or activity.",38,,
177,0.97,1171.069,1185.984,"We already have a robust and you know Includessive process that has been successful, and over the years we have worked really hard to make an effort to make our internal process clearer and easier to understand.",38,,
178,0.97,1185.984,1192.658,"Years ago, our Rfp was 20-Plus pages and had to be handwritten and filled in and sent in, in multiple copies.",38,,
179,0.97,1192.658,1195.727,Now we allow people to fill it out Online.,38,,
180,0.97,1195.727,1197.529,So we're trying to be clearer.,38,,
181,0.97,1197.529,1202.668,And I think year to year we've seen an increase in permitting.,38,,
182,0.97,1202.668,1203.235,So I think that existed.,38,,
183,0.97,1203.235,1207.773,"The clearer that we are, the more access I believe the program is to all people in the park.",38,,
184,0.97,1207.773,1215.314,"As you can see from the slides, we're working with a variety of people with different backgrounds and experiences.",38,,
185,0.97,1215.314,1222.054,"So just to wrap it up, the purpose of these changes is to clarify and update.",38,,
186,0.97,1222.054,1223.822,We're not Amendin or adding thunderstorm.,38,,
187,0.97,1223.822,1228.093,We feel it's good Governance to make the law access Cybill and easily understand afternoon.,38,,
188,0.97,1228.093,1233.432,"We feel that this clarification allows for greater transparency, consistency.",38,,
189,0.97,1233.432,1239.838,So the permit process will remain robust and inclusive.,38,,
190,0.97,1239.838,1240.172,Next slide.,38,,
191,0.97,1240.172,1240.405,Please.,38,,
192,0.97,1240.405,1248.747,And then I just wanted to showcase again two vendors that were new to the parks in 2021.,38,,
193,0.97,1248.747,1256.955,Both Wmbe--both we received very positive feedback from community members when we posted about it on social media.,38,,
194,0.97,1256.955,1264.029,These two vendors kind of highlight how we try to activate park space while providing park Goers with amenities.,38,,
195,0.97,1264.029,1273.271,"The one on the left, Madrona Beach concession stand really tried to create a welcoming space and provide affordable options and create a sense of community.",38,,
196,0.97,1273.271,1285.15,"And on the right that was one of the vendors we had at South Park, Jumpin' Jambalaya, a brand-new business owner.",38,,
197,0.97,1285.15,1291.123,As a result of her participation in that she has been able to expand her business and grow.,38,,
198,0.97,1291.123,1291.423,All right.,38,,
199,0.97,1291.423,1294.459,Thank you very much.,38,,
200,0.97,1294.459,1297.696,Thank you for that presentation.,39,,
201,0.97,1297.696,1310.308,"I have a couple of just quick questions about some of the things in the definition included in this new section 6, commercial activity definition that is in the ordinance.",39,,
202,0.97,1310.308,1315.881,And then I'm happy to open it up to committee members.,39,,
203,0.97,1315.881,1328.894,"I am curious, towards the end of the definition, where it indicates an exception would be services that are provided pursuant to a concession agreement or agreement for services.",39,,
204,0.97,1328.894,1351.016,And I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the distinction between the permitted commercial activity here and how that might be different from a concession agreement or agreement for services which wouldn't fall under this commercial activity definition.,39,,
205,0.97,1351.016,1351.383,Definitely.,40,,
206,0.97,1351.383,1354.486,That's a really good question.,40,,
207,0.97,1354.486,1363.095,"So these changes are addressing some of our short-term permitting, like these vendors can operate for a few months.",40,,
208,0.97,1363.095,1380.545,"The concession agreements are usually long-term agreements, and you may be familiar with Mary's had a golden gardens who have a long-term Five- to Ten- year concession agreements, and that is legislative through city council.",40,,
209,0.97,1380.545,1389.087,So those are separate type of agreements that fall outside of this process.,40,,
210,0.97,1389.087,1395.227,"And so, I don't know, is that answering your question?",40,,
211,0.97,1395.227,1395.494,Yeah.,41,,
212,0.97,1395.494,1396.361,"No, it totally does.",41,,
213,0.97,1396.361,1418.383,"The scope of what we're discussing today are vendor permitting decisions the Department can just make, on this legislation, where as some of these long-term things that the Council itself would have to approve are categorically distinct.",41,,
214,0.97,1418.383,1419.985,That is totally clear to me.,41,,
215,0.97,1419.985,1433.031,"Can you provide a good example, maybe, of some of thing long- term concessions we currently have active in some of our parks?",41,,
216,0.97,1433.031,1434.132,Definitely.,42,,
217,0.97,1434.132,1442.507,"Long-term concessions, so there's Mary's, that's located at Golden gardens.",42,,
218,0.97,1442.507,1446.344,Marination at Seacrest park.,42,,
219,0.97,1446.344,1451.216,Magnuson brewery at Magnuson park.,42,,
220,0.97,1451.216,1454.519,Jefferson park lawn bowling.,42,,
221,0.97,1454.519,1456.288,Lawn bowling on beacon Hill.,42,,
222,0.97,1456.288,1456.655,Woodland park.,42,,
223,0.97,1456.655,1461.76,"There's green Lake pitch and putt, which is adjacent to hickory Lake park.",42,,
224,0.97,1461.76,1478.143,"All of those longer term agreements go through an Rfp process as well and then legs late and approved through the concession agreement--I'm sorry, approved through city Council, and then a long-term agreement is established.",42,,
225,0.97,1478.143,1479.244,Thank you.,43,,
226,0.97,1479.244,1516.281,"I appreciate some further illustration of the point, because one of the things I've kind of heard from some folks in the community generally about this legislation is there's always a bit of attention, or not about this legislation in particular, but the general concept of commercial activity in public parks is that there's always sort of attention between what the purpose for Park is and wanting to make sure it primarily stays for leisure, contemplation, recreation, for the Publicg and concern about an Overcommercialization of our spaces.",43,,
227,0.97,1516.281,1536.401,"It's just important to make that ill Strags that large kind of Brick-And-Mortar ongoing kinds of things, like the things you just illustrated, would fall into a more involved Council process with more deliberation versus, like, season al Pop-Up things, which this is seeking to discuss.",43,,
228,0.97,1536.401,1544.843,I just wanted to follow up on my commitment to some community members to make sure that point was well illustrated in our discussion.,43,,
229,0.97,1544.843,1550.315,So I appreciate you sort of expanding on that and making that distinction.,43,,
230,0.97,1550.315,1558.29,"So with that, are there any other questions from colleagues?",43,,
231,0.97,1558.29,1558.857,Councilmember Herbold.,43,,
232,0.97,1558.857,1565.196,I appreciate making the distinction between the Short- term lease agreements and the longer term lease agreements.,44,,
233,0.97,1565.196,1589.654,"But still, in that same vein, as it relates to these Short- term lease agreements, I am really interested to know whether or not you expect and are planning for an increased number of applications, and if so, do you expect to approve an increased number of applications and grant more permits.",44,,
234,0.97,1589.654,1595.794,"I'm going to go off camera again, because it SLOWS my bandwidth.",45,,
235,0.97,1595.794,1603.268,"Actually, I'm not expecting an increase from this change, because we actually--the rules are already in the parks code.",45,,
236,0.97,1603.268,1604.269,We're just clarifying here.,45,,
237,0.97,1604.269,1616.081,"But I will be honest, we have seep an increase due to the pandemic, of these type of fitness, boot camps.",45,,
238,0.97,1616.081,1626.858,"So I don't think we'll see an increase, but just more of an increase because of our changing times and we are very deliberate about where we place things.",45,,
239,0.97,1626.858,1640.572,"So if we have requests for certain park locations, we're not looking to place food vendor at green Lake where we already have an existing long- term concessionaire.",45,,
240,0.97,1640.572,1644.242,We're trying to utilize spaces that don't have amenities nearby.,45,,
241,0.97,1644.242,1649.848,"In the event of a fitness group, we try to place them in parks that are less busy.",45,,
242,0.97,1649.848,1651.182,We're very deliberate about.,45,,
243,0.97,1651.182,1657.789,We don't want to place somebody next to a neighborhood where there's a lot of people sleeping in apartments.,45,,
244,0.97,1657.789,1658.823,A 6:00 A.M.,45,,
245,0.97,1658.823,1662.827,Fitness class isn't a good movement we're pretty deliberate about that.,45,,
246,0.97,1662.827,1664.295,The public really are involved.,45,,
247,0.97,1664.295,1668.867,We get a lot of compliments about some of these activities in the park.,45,,
248,0.97,1668.867,1672.037,We also get complaints about Unpermitted vending.,45,,
249,0.97,1672.037,1684.115,"Just to be clear, we really try to achieve these goals in a careful and deliberate way.",45,,
250,0.97,1684.115,1686.117,Thank you.,46,,
251,0.97,1686.117,1690.155,"Sorry, interim director Williams--interim superintendent Williams, do you have something to add?",47,,
252,0.97,1690.155,1709.774,I would kind of add to Councilmember Herbold's question that bending and some level of commercial activity that's consistent with our mission greatly enhances and offsets sort of illegitimate use and creates legitimate positive recreational uses.,48,,
253,0.97,1709.774,1729.294,"So to the extent that we can add more con says, because they promote and Legitimize uses of parks in a manner that's consistent with public recreation uses, we would absolutely seek to do that, particularly in underutilized spaces.",48,,
254,0.97,1729.294,1744.709,So I have a question that is maybe somewhat related about just at what point is something sufficiently de Minimis that the parks Department would not expect it to be permitted?,49,,
255,0.97,1744.709,1804.536,"And an example I might raise that I just kind of see occasionally, and kind of reading the definition of something that's associated with any trade, occupation, profession, business, or franchise, or offer to promote products or services, I do know it's like fairly common for people to maybe go and shoot maybe like a promotional advertisement in a public park that might be for a small local label or someone's store that they might use for Insister-In- law advertising the or maybe putting in local Digital adds or something like that but they film it in a park or they take a picture in a park, or maybe certain politicians running for certain local offices who might on occasion use a park with their political consultant to shoot an ad where parts of it might occur in a park.",49,,
256,0.97,1804.536,1808.94,I wonder at what point is activity like that kind of de manipulate.,49,,
257,0.97,1808.94,1834.999,"♪, and at what point would there be an expectation that it would be permitted in terms of how the Department is sort of envisioning that activity, and like where does kind of the water's edge go given that at a certain level, we're all kind of entitled to a little bit of de Minimis use of our parks for purposes that kind of fall into those gray areas.",49,,
258,0.97,1834.999,1843.708,Just kind of curious how the Department kind of envisions that kind of work.,49,,
259,0.97,1843.708,1850.848,"We do have people reach out to do videos or shoots, and we usually refer them to the office of film and music.",50,,
260,0.97,1850.848,1852.917,I hope I have that title right.,50,,
261,0.97,1852.917,1856.688,But they do the permitting for that type of use for their office.,50,,
262,0.97,1856.688,1867.799,And they coordinate with a person at the parks to receive a permit for the film use.,50,,
263,0.97,1867.799,1868.132,Christopher.,50,,
264,0.97,1868.132,1874.706,"Councilmember, there is an awful lot of passes that kind of get by us because we're not staffed 24 hours a day.",51,,
265,0.97,1874.706,1877.475,And we just don't see a lot of stuff.,51,,
266,0.97,1877.475,1897.362,"I think what we're trying to discourage is the outright commercial activity that happens over a long arc of time, but, sure, people will go to a parks and there's no one there, and no one complains about it, and it was a one or two-day thing, and those kind of things get by us.",51,,
267,0.97,1897.362,1902.734,And we're not out there trying to track them down or Chase them down.,51,,
268,0.97,1902.734,1917.115,But I think the intent of something like that is far different than the ongoing business operation in a public park in in a permitted manner.,51,,
269,0.97,1917.115,1918.049,Yeah.,52,,
270,0.97,1918.049,1928.926,"No, I appreciate those Clarifications in kind of reading--and I know what the intent of the Department would be, certainly based on those responses.",52,,
271,0.97,1928.926,1938.369,"But just from reading the definition of commercial activity, some of it seems like it could be--it could kind of fall into certain de Minimis activities.",52,,
272,0.97,1938.369,1945.677,"Just kind of wondering--I don't know, it doesn't look to be like a major issue, and I trust the Department to be discreet.",52,,
273,0.97,1945.677,1955.62,Are there any other questions from colleagues about this legislation?,52,,
274,0.97,1955.62,1956.287,Councilmember Mosqueda.,52,,
275,0.97,1956.287,1957.622,Thanks for the presentation.,53,,
276,0.97,1957.622,1974.872,I guess not specific to the legislation but since we have you can you talk a little bit more about how we engage Maybe with King County and the port Untrying to increase and maintain community participation in our food vendors?,53,,
277,0.97,1974.872,1987.952,"Sadly, we had had an amazing food vendor who was out of the port property just north of a park, and do you remember him?",53,,
278,0.97,1987.952,1988.953,"Okay, I'm seeing that.",53,,
279,0.97,1988.953,1991.456,Rod was his name.,53,,
280,0.97,1991.456,1997.428,He was an amazing community member and just a real asset to creating a sense of community and culture.,53,,
281,0.97,1997.428,2008.106,"He Unfortunately wasn't able to stay there with the construction that was taking place, then Covid hit and a lot of changes happened.",53,,
282,0.97,2008.106,2014.278,I guess I bring that up as an example to say this is something that pained me to SP watch it happen.,53,,
283,0.97,2014.278,2018.349,I know it wasn't part of our city family who had Overseen that specific location.,53,,
284,0.97,2018.349,2043.408,"But in the wake of Covid as we think about making sure people have economic stability and creating opportunities on our public lands, can you talk about any, maybe, strategies that you are thinking of to increase people coming in and having an opportunity to be vendors on our public lands and in partnership with other jurisdictions in the area?",53,,
285,0.97,2043.408,2049.58,You want me to jump in first?,54,,
286,0.97,2049.58,2050.615,Sure.,55,,
287,0.97,2050.615,2050.982,Thank you.,56,,
288,0.97,2050.982,2051.349,Great question.,56,,
289,0.97,2051.349,2072.003,"Near the beginning of the pandemic, we did try a couple of pilot programs Partnering with S-Dot to really make sure that our two departments were aligned when--if somebody came to us, but what they really were looking for was a street location, we made sure they got in touch, and vice versa.",56,,
290,0.97,2072.003,2082.18,We also provided S-Dot with a list of parks that could accommodate food trucks and things like that for maybe adjacent to the park because they were not big enough.,56,,
291,0.97,2082.18,2092.757,"Anyway, we had some planning going on with to make sure everybody seeking a permit was permitted.",56,,
292,0.97,2092.757,2097.395,"We don't that have ram with King county or the port of Seattle, but that's definitely something we could look into.",56,,
293,0.97,2097.395,2101.299,We could talk to their real property folks and their permitting folks and see.,56,,
294,0.97,2101.299,2112.41,I have never heard of any conflicts or--where our properties touch or something and we might be able to provide an opportunity that the port or the county couldn't.,56,,
295,0.97,2112.41,2118.983,But we could look into that and see what opportunities are out there.,56,,
296,0.97,2118.983,2139.804,"And I would just add to that, that we absolutely recognize that these small vending contracts are definitely an economic development Stimulator for the community, and we regularly put out Rfps encouraging vendors and concessionaires to apply.",57,,
297,0.97,2139.804,2153.451,So we could even reach out to that person and let them know that we have these processes that are Ongo and give them some information about the Timeline.,57,,
298,0.97,2153.451,2163.227,"I will also note that we do work--Joanne mentioned S- dots, and that's true, but we also have worked with the office of economic development.",58,,
299,0.97,2163.227,2166.631,We receive a lot of inquiries from new business owners.,58,,
300,0.97,2166.631,2173.804,"There are a lot of resources that we share with people, including Washington state food truck Association and Seattle food truck.",58,,
301,0.97,2173.804,2177.074,We work with them as well.,58,,
302,0.97,2177.074,2185.55,And the library also had a small business program before the pandemic that we would often refer people to try to connect them to resources.,58,,
303,0.97,2185.55,2196.494,"So I think your point is well taken, if we just continue to explore different avenues to create opportunities to people.",58,,
304,0.97,2196.494,2199.564,I do have a follow-up.,59,,
305,0.97,2199.564,2201.032,Quick follow-up.,60,,
306,0.97,2201.032,2201.532,Thanks for that answer.,60,,
307,0.97,2201.532,2205.336,I'm glad to know about the connection within the city family among departments.,60,,
308,0.97,2205.336,2219.383,Yes would love to hear more about the ongoing connection with King County that you are noting expanding on or creating in the port.,60,,
309,0.97,2219.383,2222.787,One of my favorite park happens to be Jack black park.,60,,
310,0.97,2222.787,2231.095,But nobody really goes in deciding who is the manager of this park.,60,,
311,0.97,2231.095,2239.203,They just go in for the opportunity.,60,,
