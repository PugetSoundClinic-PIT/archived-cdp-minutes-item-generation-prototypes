48,0.97,348.214,352.652,Thank you for hearing my comment.,12,,
49,0.97,352.652,354.287,My name is Robin Briggs.,12,,
50,0.97,354.287,356.589,I'm a member of people for employment Seattle.,12,,
51,0.97,356.589,359.792,We urge you to support the energy code with two amendments.,12,,
52,0.97,359.792,375.408,"We believe the requirements for space heating should take effect immediately and we believe that the rules for efficient electricity for space and water heating should apply for all buildings, not just hotels and multifamily buildings.",12,,
53,0.97,375.408,384.917,"Some context, we reported that greenhouse gas emissions are on the rise in Seattle, up 8.3% in two years from 2016 to 2018.",12,,
54,0.97,384.917,392.759,Those years had a lot of new building and I'm guessing the new buildings are contributing to the increase in emissions.,12,,
55,0.97,392.759,393.426,Obviously we need new buildings.,12,,
56,0.97,393.426,400.066,You just have to walk by the park and see everybody living in tents to know that we need a lot of new buildings.,12,,
57,0.97,400.066,407.573,"If you rent, maybe you're part of the 30% of Renters that are burdened.",12,,
58,0.97,407.573,410.977,We need to accommodate the growth while not growing emissions.,12,,
59,0.97,410.977,413.813,This requires new buildings to be clean energy.,12,,
60,0.97,413.813,417.55,Old buildings will need to be converted over the next 15 years.,12,,
61,0.97,417.55,421.454,Converting a building is more expensive than building it right the first time.,12,,
62,0.97,421.454,423.689,New buildings will be standing for a long time.,12,,
63,0.97,423.689,428.861,Let them be efficient buildings that save people money on utilities.,12,,
64,0.97,428.861,434.5,Let them be buildings so the city doesn't have to spend a lot more money.,12,,
65,0.97,434.5,437.837,Let them be buildings we can be proud of.,12,,
66,0.97,437.837,445.545,Every year from now until 2030 we need to decrease emissions in Seattle by 7.6% to make our goals.,12,,
67,0.97,445.545,446.479,We haven't made that goal ever.,12,,
68,0.97,446.479,453.686,Let's get a good start this year Bypassing the new energy code.,12,,
69,0.97,453.686,453.953,Thank you.,12,,
70,0.97,453.953,456.656,"Thank you, Robin.",13,,

72,0.97,463.196,465.298,.,13,,
73,0.97,465.298,466.399,"Good morning, Councilmembers.",14,,
74,0.97,466.399,466.833,Good morning.,15,,
75,0.97,466.833,467.8,My name is Brittany.,15,,
76,0.97,467.8,469.569,I'm a chair of Sierra Club Seattle group.,15,,
77,0.97,469.569,471.904,Thank you Forking to the time this morning.,15,,
78,0.97,471.904,484.016,I'm calling in support of the upcoming code changes that will ensure that new businesses and multifamily building will be built free and safe.,15,,
79,0.97,484.016,486.919,Seattle faces the impacts of climate pollution every day.,15,,
80,0.97,486.919,491.49,One-third comes from buildings and most produced by the use of Fracked gas.,15,,
81,0.97,491.49,498.397,"It is a simple and effective way to quickly reduce our gas consumption, lowering the damage to the climate.",15,,
82,0.97,498.397,512.511,"In fact, every plan Seattle has for meeting the climate goals requires the prevention of new fossil fuel use in buildings.",15,,
83,0.97,512.511,517.917,Choosing clean energy helps with gas extraction and transport are extremely harmful.,15,,
84,0.97,517.917,524.59,It is important to know that they're felt most intensely by communities.,15,,
85,0.97,524.59,543.843,Red lining and other historical and Online injustices have already forced people of color to live in close proximity to pollution and the outcomes can be measures in years of loss of life.,15,,
86,0.97,543.843,550.383,"Electric buildings are an Insdensible part of our green future and public health, safety and racial equity.",15,,
87,0.97,550.383,561.26,We strongly support the commercial building code upgrades and future efforts to protect our homes and other buildings and people inside and outside of them from dangerous and Polluting fossil fuels.,15,,
88,0.97,561.26,562.061,Thank you.,15,,
89,0.97,562.061,563.195,"Thank you, Brittany.",16,,
90,0.97,563.195,573.739,Up next we have Deepa and Riva Morris following and Steve Gell on deck.,16,,
91,0.97,573.739,574.073,Good morning.,16,,
92,0.97,574.073,575.675,Thank you.,17,,
93,0.97,575.675,577.376,My name is Deepa.,17,,
94,0.97,577.376,581.814,I'm the Washington policy manager at climate solutions.,17,,
95,0.97,581.814,592.591,We strongly support the proposed update to the commercial energy code which will essentially eliminate fossil fuel uses in New commercial and large multifamily buildings in Seattle.,17,,
96,0.97,592.591,605.905,"The proposed updates are timely as Brittany from Sierra Club mentions, Seattle faces major climate change impacts and we need to take bold action to reduce Seattle's greenhouse gas emissions and new buildings.",17,,
97,0.97,605.905,614.18,"In Washington state, greenhouse gas emissions from buildings are growing at a faster rate than any sort of Carbonon pollution.",17,,
98,0.97,614.18,621.954,"In Seattle, energy use for large multifamily buildings accounts for 20% of our emissions.",17,,
99,0.97,621.954,633.633,The use of fossil fuels in buildings increases air pollution and related health impacts such as respiratory and cardiovascular disease.,17,,
100,0.97,633.633,643.275,"As Robin mentioned, we would also like to see the two amendments to the proposed update which I have submitted in writing to the Council.",17,,
101,0.97,643.275,659.025,"Firstly, regarding section C 403.1.4 which Formalizes code restrictions and extends to multifamily buildings the element of the code is scheduled to be implemented in 2022 even though most of the code will be implemented this July.",17,,
102,0.97,659.025,661.293,We believe the delay is unnecessary.,17,,
103,0.97,661.293,670.97,The technology is here and it is affordable and we need to act on the climate crisis now.,17,,
104,0.97,670.97,683.783,"Secondly, on section C404.2.3 which requires water heating, the central hot water, we urge the city to extend the provision to all buildings covered by the code, not just hotels and large multifamily buildings.",17,,
105,0.97,683.783,699.698,"By approving the code without the unnecessary delays and limitations, the city has the opportunity to make head way on Seattle's climate goals and protect the health of our residents.",17,,
106,0.97,699.698,699.965,Thank you.,17,,
107,0.97,699.965,700.299,Thank you.,18,,
108,0.97,700.299,707.273,Up next is Riva followed by Steve and Alec.,18,,
109,0.97,707.273,717.55,Are you present?,18,,
110,0.97,721.921,723.889,"I. T., I'm not seeing her.",18,,
111,0.97,723.889,731.03,You may have to press Star 6.,18,,
112,0.97,731.03,743.042,We just had you there for a second.,18,,
113,0.97,743.042,749.448,One more time.,18,,
114,0.97,749.448,749.815,Hello?,19,,
115,0.97,749.815,751.984,There we are.,20,,
116,0.97,751.984,755.488,"Hi, yes, sorry about that.",21,,
117,0.97,755.488,756.722,"Hi, my name is Arvia Morris.",21,,
118,0.97,756.722,765.197,I think there was a Typo by me in the registration.,21,,
119,0.97,765.197,767.666,"Yes, I'm from the 43rd district environmental caucus.",21,,
120,0.97,767.666,775.307,I would like to testify that we really need these building codes improvements now and the reason is population growth.,21,,
121,0.97,775.307,779.812,It is not just meeting our needs for today.,21,,
122,0.97,779.812,789.455,The population in the Puget sound area is set to continue to explode throughout the rest of the decades we're facing.,21,,
123,0.97,789.455,792.858,"We really cannot, you know, we're missing all of the climate goals now.",21,,
124,0.97,792.858,797.329,It is just going to be even more exacerbated with the population growth.,21,,
125,0.97,797.329,805.104,We absolutely need to be building zero emission buildings starting immediately.,21,,
126,0.97,805.104,809.441,Designers and the building industry will probably be upset about this.,21,,
127,0.97,809.441,813.579,They really need to adapt and I don't think it is asking too much.,21,,
128,0.97,813.579,833.199,"There is definitely architects that can design buildings that are zero emissions and they don't need to have fossil fuels in them and they can be very comfortable and climate resistant homes, climate resilient homes, and office buildings.",21,,
129,0.97,833.199,833.966,Just think about it.,21,,
130,0.97,833.966,855.588,"We have done a really, I would like to thank the Council and the state government for all they have really done to try to help us get through Covid, but, you know, and we're one of the best States in the country for Covid, but we're nothing compared to Japan and New Zealand and Australia who really handled this.",21,,
131,0.97,855.588,861.026,"So think about it, in 20 or 30 years, that is an acute crisis.",21,,
132,0.97,861.026,862.461,Climate crisis is a chronic crisis.,21,,
133,0.97,862.461,870.87,What are we going to look for in 2040 if we don't address this immediately now?,21,,
134,0.97,870.87,871.403,This is a chronic crisis.,21,,
135,0.97,871.403,878.11,We need to get on it with the building codes.,21,,
136,0.97,878.11,878.41,Thank you.,21,,
137,0.97,878.41,879.511,Thank you.,22,,
138,0.97,879.511,886.385,"Up next we have Steve Gill, Alec.",22,,
139,0.97,886.385,886.852,"Steve, good morning.",22,,
140,0.97,886.852,889.355,"Good morning, Councilmembers.",23,,
141,0.97,889.355,895.527,I'm Steve Gill with the building task force and the housing development exemplary building program.,23,,
142,0.97,895.527,899.832,I'm here to support the update to the Seattle commercial energy code.,23,,
143,0.97,899.832,910.042,We need to accelerate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in our buildings by restricting fossil fuel use and improving Efficientlisy.,23,,
144,0.97,910.042,913.879,The proposed updates put us on a path to achieve the climate goals.,23,,
145,0.97,913.879,924.089,They have worked hard to make certain that the impacts of the code can and will be Equitafble.,23,,
146,0.97,924.089,928.661,They have piloted measures that will be implemented through this code.,23,,
147,0.97,928.661,939.238,We have worked to reduce premium costs and demonstrated that there are benefits for affordable housing providers.,23,,
148,0.97,939.238,953.952,"Additionally, with sufficient resources, the adoption of new technologies required by the code and the work that it will generate can provide opportunities to diversify the construction work force and open doors for women and minority owned businesses.",23,,
149,0.97,953.952,969.134,"Finally, we believe that with proper planning, including the incremental steps forward that are represented in the code, we can have a transition for the small number of fossil fuel workers impacted by the code.",23,,
150,0.97,969.134,973.138,We can and should do more.,23,,
151,0.97,973.138,977.443,"We need amendments to remove the buildings, use electricity for space heating.",23,,
152,0.97,977.443,981.647,This is a proven technology and ready for implementation now.,23,,
153,0.97,981.647,988.854,"Finally, we need to require that all buildings covered under the code use electricity for water heating.",23,,
154,0.97,988.854,993.792,Using our clean and plentiful electricity in our buildings makes sense.,23,,
155,0.97,993.792,995.561,Thank you for your time.,23,,
156,0.97,995.561,996.528,"Thank you, Steve.",24,,
157,0.97,996.528,1006.805,"Up next we have Alec con Lynn, Holly towns followed by Charlie.",24,,
158,0.97,1006.805,1010.909,"Good morning, Alec.",25,,
159,0.97,1010.909,1014.246,"Good morning,.",26,,
160,0.97,1014.246,1016.982,I'm the campaigns code director with Seattle.,26,,
161,0.97,1016.982,1022.654,Thank you for the chance to testify today and belated happy new year to all of the Council.,26,,
162,0.97,1022.654,1041.84,"Like everyone else we have heard from so far, I'm here to advocate for the strongest possible energy codes and to ask Council to please introduce an amendment to ensure that the codes are implemented in 2021 and not in 2022 as is currently proposed.",26,,
163,0.97,1041.84,1063.695,"It is my understanding from the process, there was quite a bit of back and forth on the implementation dates before it was transmitted to Council and it was disappointing to see the legislation currently, not implemented until 2022 and I'm hoping that Council can rectify that in the next couple of weeks as it is moving through.",26,,
164,0.97,1063.695,1077.042,"As you have already heard last month, O. S. E. released the inventory for 2017 and 2018 providing important data on how we're doing when it comes to the climate crisis.",26,,
165,0.97,1077.042,1082.014,"Unfortunately, as Seattle's overall greenhouse gas emissions are continuing to rise.",26,,
166,0.97,1082.014,1088.387,There is one reason for that.,26,,
167,0.97,1088.387,1095.694,That is between emissions rose by 8.3%.,26,,
168,0.97,1095.694,1105.037,Tackling climate pollution from our buildings is vital if we want to recognize the Seattle green new deal and say we're doing better.,26,,
169,0.97,1105.037,1110.742,That means implementing the codes this year and not next year.,26,,
170,0.97,1110.742,1127.693,"I wanted to mention that after we pass the new codes, new residential homes will still be getting built this year and next year with oil and gas and heat unless we do additional steps to change that.",26,,
171,0.97,1127.693,1128.76,Energy codes are a great start.,26,,

192,0.97,1225.457,1229.061,We ask you to go a little further.,29,,
193,0.97,1229.061,1242.874,"Please remove the proposed delay in the use of official electric space heating and also require efficient electric water heating for all commercial buildings, not just hotels and multifamily.",29,,
194,0.97,1242.874,1253.819,We need you to step up and make the changes that the construction advisory board were reluctant to do due to pressure from a few designers and developers.,29,,

348,0.97,2116.681,2121.152,What changes are in the 2018 code that help us achieve our purpose?,60,,
349,0.97,2121.152,2127.758,Duane and Micah will be going in more detail but I would like to briefly highlight safe Seattle.,60,,
350,0.97,2127.758,2136.801,The new code reflects the most current understanding of the region.,60,,
351,0.97,2136.801,2137.969,It ADOPTS new tsunami.,60,,
352,0.97,2137.969,2150.214,There is a robust set of changes to construct new high rises with provisions for mass timber and CLT construction and adding Sprinklers to town house construction.,60,,
353,0.97,2150.214,2152.083,Let's talk about a livable Seattle.,60,,
354,0.97,2152.083,2160.591,There are code changes clarify requirements for tiny home construction.,60,,

357,0.97,2170.601,2178.242,This code provides new requirements for gender neutral Restrooms.,60,,
358,0.97,2178.242,2178.676,"Next slide, please.",60,,
359,0.97,2178.676,2185.716,"While we expect much discussion today on the energy code amendments, there are multiple codes in the suite of 2018 codes.",60,,
360,0.97,2185.716,2191.989,Amendments to each of these codes listed will be included in the legislation to Council.,60,,
361,0.97,2191.989,2197.195,Duane and Micah will provide an over view of the most significant changes to all of the codes today.,60,,
362,0.97,2197.195,2210.541,"With that, I would like to pass it off to Duane on the energy code.",60,,
363,0.97,2210.541,2211.409,"Thanks, Ardel.",61,,
364,0.97,2211.409,2216.347,"The 2018 national energy code came out just before 2018, of course.",61,,
365,0.97,2216.347,2229.327,"Washington state added its amendments during 2019 and Seattle worked out its amendments on top of that during 2020, almost all of which strengthened the code.",61,,
366,0.97,2229.327,2233.431,Seattle's amendments get picked up in subsequent state and national codes as those move forward.,61,,
367,0.97,2233.431,2240.471,State law doesn't allow us to touch the code for single family or low rise multifamily energy issues.,61,,
368,0.97,2240.471,2250.147,These amendments that we'll talk about here apply to all of the other building types.,61,,
369,0.97,2250.147,2260.591,"In the principles we use for developing the Seattle code are focus on building high quality walls and windows and roofing, because those are going to last for generations.",61,,

371,0.97,2268.532,2271.769,Start Ramping up the renewable energy supply.,61,,
372,0.97,2271.769,2285.416,The idea is that our new buildings will be easily able to meet our carbon neutral standard for 2050 without having to rip it apart and rebuild things between now and then.,61,,
373,0.97,2285.416,2294.592,"Those five issues you see on the left side of your screen are the most critical ones for meeting the Foreprinciples, as you'll see in the next group of slides.",61,,
374,0.97,2294.592,2300.364,There are 100 smaller changes that mostly clean up this code.,61,,
375,0.97,2300.364,2307.805,"Space heating and residential water heating make up, perhaps 90% of the gas use.",61,,
376,0.97,2307.805,2318.449,We're tackling those in this code cycle and the other minor gas uses will need a lot more work with the community going forward.,61,,
377,0.97,2318.449,2325.956,We're greatly restricting the use of gas and electric existence for space heating in favor of heat pumps.,61,,
378,0.97,2325.956,2336.2,There is a list of 18 exceptions that allow electric and that was driven Pardonly to reduce affordable housing costs.,61,,
379,0.97,2336.2,2348.112,"A late change was exception one was added to delay the effective date for this until next year, and you have heard from a number of Commenters about their opinion about that one.",61,,
380,0.97,2348.112,2361.325,"Another significant change is that, for hotel and multifamily, at least, we're not any longer allowing central water heating systems to be heated by gas or electric either.",61,,
381,0.97,2361.325,2365.296,Using heat pumps for this as well will be the way we go.,61,,
382,0.97,2365.296,2377.174,We delayed implementation of this one until January of '22 from the beginning of the code update because the technology is new for a lot of our engineers and builders.,61,,
383,0.97,2377.174,2382.713,We need this extra time for education and training.,61,,
384,0.97,2382.713,2390.721,"We have reduced power to 10% below the state standard, recognizes this rapidly advancing L.E.D.",61,,
385,0.97,2390.721,2404.668,Technology and requiring a suitable electric outlet behind every gas stove and apartments so it will be easy to plug in an induction Cook top in the future.,61,,
386,0.97,2404.668,2418.716,The state code and Seattle code require each new building to select from a list of above code options for each one of their projects.,61,,
387,0.97,2418.716,2425.823,The state requires a total--from this chart.,61,,
388,0.97,2425.823,2427.725,Seattle will acquire eight credits.,61,,
389,0.97,2427.725,2434.865,"By the way, I'm going through this, this in eight minutes, we have spent the last 18 months full time doing.",61,,
390,0.97,2434.865,2443.04,All of our tall buildings complex buildings like LABS and hospitals use energy models to comply with the code.,61,,
391,0.97,2443.04,2450.181,That is a complex software driven calculation that let some things build worse than code and balance with things other than code.,61,,
392,0.97,2450.181,2455.452,The major change is that the metric will be carbon emissions.,61,,
393,0.97,2455.452,2471.902,"Since Seattle's code is more Stringen generally than the state code, we'll require lower carbon emissions in this calculation as well, lower than the state code, as you see in that yellow highlighted area.",61,,
394,0.97,2471.902,2481.912,"Significantly there, we will not any longer be allowing the energy Modelling to be used to make the building envelope a lot worse than would be allowed for other buildings.",61,,
395,0.97,2481.912,2485.516,Walls and windows will be with the city longer than any of us will.,61,,
396,0.97,2485.516,2489.887,We have to build them right to start with.,61,,
397,0.97,2489.887,2495.726,"We're requiring a small, solar Ray on most buildings, but we're exempting affordable housing.",61,,
398,0.97,2495.726,2500.13,This is one of the things that would be easily added to the building after the fact.,61,,
399,0.97,2500.13,2510.107,"For buildings that can't or don't want to put the solar on their own roofs, we provided an option to gift the solar over to an affordable housing project.",61,,
400,0.97,2510.107,2520.818,We also require a large area of the roof on all of the buildings to be set up to easily accommodate a larger solar array in the future.,61,,
401,0.97,2520.818,2533.197,"In case you're wondering, this would take up just 3.5% of a roof of a two story building or 36% of the roof of a 20 story building.",61,,
402,0.97,2533.197,2544.475,"With that, I'll hand it over to Micah Chappell to run through the highlights of all of the other codes.",61,,
403,0.97,2544.475,2545.643,"Thank you, Duane.",62,,
404,0.97,2545.643,2546.844,I appreciate the time.,62,,
405,0.97,2546.844,2560.591,"State limits what jurisdictions can modify the residential code and as such, most of the changes to the Seattle building code and the Seattle residential code were collaborated and approved through the state.",62,,
406,0.97,2560.591,2576.407,"Members of Sdci work with multiple organizations, including the Washington Association of building officials, structural engineers Association of Washington, Department of social and health services and the Washington labor and industries Department.",62,,
407,0.97,2576.407,2585.883,Members of Sdci participated in over 350 meetings as Duane indicated to the past couple of years.,62,,
408,0.97,2585.883,2619.049,"They have been approved by the Advisory board whose members are appointed by the Mayor and high lights to the 2018 amendments include mass timber, which is CLT, at least that is the common name most folks call it, and there are three new types of construction created in the 2018 code as a type 4 a, B, and C with type a being constructed at 18 stories in height.",62,,
409,0.97,2619.049,2619.717,"Next slide, please.",62,,
410,0.97,2619.717,2627.958,"Additionally, we had a modification, although minor, it does align efficiency dwelling units with the required space of dwelling units.",62,,
411,0.97,2627.958,2635.199,There was a Deficiently in the code where a dwelling unit could be smaller than an efficiency dwelling unit.,62,,
412,0.97,2635.199,2644.441,So that modification was made to address those smaller spaces.,62,,
413,0.97,2644.441,2644.641,Next.,62,,
414,0.97,2644.641,2659.556,"Gender neutral Restrooms were introduced into the state code as a policy, Seattle allowed these and it is what the code provisions will show is that it provides the guidance when these are Construced or chosen.",62,,
415,0.97,2659.556,2678.809,It is not a requirement but it is an option for those who want to provide those types of facilities and provide jurisdictions a a way to review and inspect the facilities so ensure they meet the most current standards for accessibility and allowance of use.,62,,
416,0.97,2678.809,2689.82,Next slide this change or series of changes for our high rise Pressurization for smoke control and Egress.,62,,
417,0.97,2689.82,2710.24,It is more specific for Seattle and provides modifications that take most of the policies and actions or response times into consideration and moderate Fies various sections of the code to address those accurately.,62,,
418,0.97,2710.24,2710.541,Next slide.,62,,
419,0.97,2710.541,2728.859,"Additionally is what we have, as you heard mentioned, increased or actually a new section that talks about tsunami loads and how those need to be taken into account when designing buildings in certain types of risk categories of structures.",62,,
420,0.97,2728.859,2734.731,Those are your hospitals or even what they call elevated evacuation structures.,62,,
421,0.97,2734.731,2739.47,Some of you may see those as you go down to visit long beach or places like that.,62,,
422,0.97,2739.47,2742.439,"Additionally, we have some increase in seismic load.",62,,
423,0.97,2742.439,2759.223,"This was more of a national level code change but of course, Seattle is adopting it and it is more specific to what occurs in Seattle as well as other locations that have high seismic activity.",62,,
424,0.97,2759.223,2759.59,Next slide.,62,,
425,0.97,2759.59,2761.992,Now we're moving into the residential code.,62,,
426,0.97,2761.992,2773.17,One of the major changes we have in the residential code is that the state adopted a change for automatic Sprinklers as well as information.,62,,
427,0.97,2773.17,2785.315,We're including items including sleeping loss and changes to tiny houses per some discussions of legislation.,62,,
428,0.97,2785.315,2785.649,Next slide.,62,,
429,0.97,2785.649,2797.728,The town house sprinkler changes were approved and worked through with the Washington Association of fire chiefs and the Washington Association of building officials as well as others and were approved at the state level.,62,,
430,0.97,2797.728,2804.768,Seattle is allowed by law to modify this one area of the residential code.,62,,
431,0.97,2804.768,2808.472,"As such, we have decided to eliminate an exception.",62,,
432,0.97,2808.472,2821.485,"What that exception does is at the state level, town house buildings that had four units or less did not have to require or install automatic Sprinklers.",62,,
433,0.97,2821.485,2834.198,They chose to remove the exception where we require that all new construction town houses have Sprinklers installed.,62,,
434,0.97,2834.198,2839.603,Next slide.,62,,
435,0.97,2839.603,2850.681,The last item on the list or one of the last items had to deal with tiny houses.,62,,
436,0.97,2850.681,2861.692,There were multiple changes and requests through the state that looked at tiny houses and wanted to incorporate that.,62,,
437,0.97,2861.692,2875.405,"Instead of having a separate Appendix for everything, the state took and worked through the most important parts of Appendix and moved into the main body of the residential code for use in all dwelling units.",62,,
438,0.97,2875.405,2878.742,That would incorporate what we call sleeping loss.,62,,
439,0.97,2878.742,2882.212,"That would be a small space, primarily used for sleeping.",62,,
440,0.97,2882.212,2887.718,What it does is it incorporates safety measures including smoke detectors and Egress.,62,,
441,0.97,2887.718,2897.594,"When a lot of folks start to wonder how big they are, it will be a maximum size of 69 square feet between 35 and 69 square feet.",62,,
442,0.97,2897.594,2902.399,"When folks try to picture that, just think of a built in bunk bed.",62,,
443,0.97,2902.399,2934.364,"Those are now in the main body of the code as well as some definitions that go along with that and then the last modification to Appendix Q does identify what a single dwelling unit at 400-Square foot is and provides specifics for that, including some modifications for energy code to help with the air barrier testing for the smaller spaces.",62,,
444,0.97,2934.364,2944.174,"Overall, there are just multiple changes for addressing tiny spaces or small houses in the new residential code.",62,,
445,0.97,2944.174,2944.474,Next slide?,62,,
446,0.97,2944.474,2956.687,"Additionally, some of the major changes that we want to make note of as most talked about the smoke filtration or smoke that happened during the Wildfires.",62,,
447,0.97,2956.687,2965.395,This new allowance creates a space to install that filter that will work to filter out the smoke during an event.,62,,
448,0.97,2965.395,2976.44,"This is not a mandate that all new filters are installed, but it does mandate that the space be provided for those when the systems are installed.",62,,
449,0.97,2976.44,2993.423,"Additionally, the electrical code has a modification to address the calculated loads for the advanced heat pump and energy code and we aligned the infrastructure to match that of the land use code that has become more restrictive as of last year.",62,,
450,0.97,2993.423,3012.242,The last item as of NOTE will be the plumbing code and a code alternate for and we're putting that into the code as a standard allowance.,62,,
451,0.97,3012.242,3018.548,That COMPLETES the highlights of our 2018 code updates and we hope that you look to move these forward.,62,,
452,0.97,3018.548,3025.355,"If you have any questions, please let us know.",62,,
453,0.97,3025.355,3025.655,Thank you.,62,,
454,0.97,3025.655,3027.357,"Thank you, and thank you.",63,,
455,0.97,3027.357,3037.2,If you could be ready to Reshare the power point presentation as colleges may have questions.,63,,
456,0.97,3037.2,3048.845,I have a few but I'll hold my questions until I see what my colleagues have to ask.,63,,
457,0.97,3048.845,3049.413,"Colleagues, any questions?",63,,
458,0.97,3049.413,3049.846,Thank you.,64,,
459,0.97,3049.846,3067.764,Thank you for the thorough presentation and really appreciate the Department and the chair setting it up as a presentation first so we can get our feet wet with the changes and better understand them before the actual legislation comes down.,64,,
460,0.97,3067.764,3086.883,One of the things I was excited about last year is when the city council passed the update to the fiscal note to have a climate change question that we ask about emissions and adaptation.,64,,
461,0.97,3086.883,3095.325,"The changes will probably, when the fiscal climate NOTE is completed, will show the benefits in the fiscal NOTE and wanted to say I look forward to that.",64,,
462,0.97,3095.325,3103.3,I know that will come along with the legislation when we actually get the legislation to see those climate change questions.,64,,
463,0.97,3103.3,3111.975,You addressed a lot of those in your presentation about dealing we missions and also adapting the climate change like Wildfire smoke.,64,,
464,0.97,3111.975,3121.618,Thank you for that and I look forward to the revised fiscal climate NOTE with the legislation.,64,,
465,0.97,3121.618,3126.656,Thank you.,64,,
466,0.97,3126.656,3128.191,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",65,,
467,0.97,3128.191,3129.326,"Colleagues, other questions?",65,,
468,0.97,3129.326,3130.494,"Vice chair Mosqueda, good morning.",65,,
469,0.97,3130.494,3130.994,Thank you very much.,66,,
470,0.97,3130.994,3134.764,Thank you very much for the presentation.,66,,
471,0.97,3134.764,3141.571,I appreciate the technical walk through of the details outside of the technical and sort of stepping back to the macro.,66,,
472,0.97,3141.571,3161.358,You put a lot of excitement about this and I'm looking forward to working with the chair and the folks that provided the presentation to get into the details and hear a little bit more about ways that we may want to strengthen certain elements of the legislation.,66,,
473,0.97,3161.358,3161.992,Councilmember Strauss and Mr.,66,,
474,0.97,3161.992,3172.035,"Chair, do you want us to hold a discussion for possible ideas for strengthening or potential changes until the next opportunity for us to meet?",66,,
475,0.97,3172.035,3176.039,I would be happy to have the conversation today.,67,,
476,0.97,3176.039,3181.745,We had previously expected this legislation would have been transmitted earlier and could have been before us.,67,,
477,0.97,3181.745,3187.584,The legislation has been transmitted as of this last Monday and will be at the next week's introduction referral calendar.,67,,
478,0.97,3187.584,3193.99,I hope to move swiftly at the next committee.,67,,
479,0.97,3193.99,3196.893,I would welcome the conversation here today.,67,,
480,0.97,3196.893,3199.229,"Thank you very much, Mr.",68,,
481,0.97,3199.229,3199.462,Chair.,68,,
482,0.97,3199.462,3200.363,I am really excited about this.,68,,
483,0.97,3200.363,3216.179,"I think in some of the preliminary conversations I have had and in talking through the initial draft with our team, one of the things I'm interested in is eliminating the delay and allowing natural gas to be used for both water and space heating.",68,,
484,0.97,3216.179,3230.727,"Just would love to hear more about the opportunities there, the potential interests among colleagues to the extent that they're able to as well.",68,,
485,0.97,3230.727,3238.902,"Mr. Strauss, would you like me to?",69,,
486,0.97,3238.902,3239.869,Please.,70,,
487,0.97,3239.869,3247.177,The heat pump water heating is still unfamiliar to many local engineers and contractors.,71,,
488,0.97,3247.177,3256.853,"At the public meetings, the feeling was that we needed extra time for education and training.",71,,
489,0.97,3256.853,3262.192,"The use--that, I think, really does need that delay.",71,,
490,0.97,3262.192,3264.294,It is new for too many people.,71,,
491,0.97,3264.294,3271.768,Heat pumps for space heating is common and well understood.,71,,
492,0.97,3271.768,3280.91,The addition of that additional delay was something that happened at the construction code advisory meeting.,71,,
493,0.97,3280.91,3290.687,It is not necessary that we delay that for another year.,71,,
494,0.97,3290.687,3290.954,Great.,72,,
495,0.97,3290.954,3292.022,Thank you.,72,,
496,0.97,3292.022,3293.79,I see Councilmember Lewis coming off mute.,72,,
497,0.97,3293.79,3297.994,"Councilmember Lewis, do you have thoughts to share?",72,,
498,0.97,3297.994,3299.629,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",73,,
499,0.97,3299.629,3310.14,"I do, since we're Cueing up this discussion, I'm trying to get my notes back up in front of me here.",73,,
500,0.97,3310.14,3312.942,This discussion on potential changes just want to ask extra staff.,73,,
501,0.97,3312.942,3320.417,I have an interest in extending the restrictions on gas for water heating.,73,,
502,0.97,3320.417,3324.421,If it is currently included for residential and hotels but not for commercial buildings.,73,,
503,0.97,3324.421,3328.625,I would be interested in extend taking to commercial buildings.,73,,
504,0.97,3328.625,3358.121,"I wonder in the process of getting these code updates put together why that is not in the initial package, what the potential hurdles are there, and how we might work together in the next few weeks to take advantage Thif opportunity in Rezinning the energy code to make sure we have the broadest possible impact to meet our climate goals and it seems like adding commercial buildings would be a good way to do that.",73,,
505,0.97,3358.121,3360.39,That is my question.,73,,
506,0.97,3360.39,3364.661,"I'll take that one, too.",74,,
507,0.97,3364.661,3366.362,We could do this.,74,,
508,0.97,3366.362,3368.832,Hotel and multifamily water heating are really predictable.,74,,
509,0.97,3368.832,3376.84,It is relatively straight forward to design and size those systems.,74,,
510,0.97,3376.84,3382.212,"With other commercial buildings, especially, most all Seattle buildings have ground floor lease space, right?",74,,
511,0.97,3382.212,3392.021,There is a lot more variability.,74,,
512,0.97,3392.021,3394.557,Retail stores hardly need a lot.,74,,
513,0.97,3394.557,3398.394,Gyms and restaurants need lots of hot water.,74,,
514,0.97,3398.394,3401.498,We could extend to other types.,74,,
515,0.97,3401.498,3415.278,It would be Trickier for the engineers and part of this was just my sort of intuitive calculation on how far we can take anything this code cycle.,74,,
516,0.97,3415.278,3416.546,It is doable.,74,,
517,0.97,3416.546,3418.615,"If that is the case, Mr.",75,,
518,0.97,3418.615,3420.517,"Chair, a brief follow up.",75,,
519,0.97,3420.517,3425.789,I have flagged my interests to central staff about pursuing such an amendment.,75,,
520,0.97,3425.789,3437.934,"I want to reaffirm that here publicly, that I definitely want to pursue the amendment to expand the requirement to commercial buildings.",75,,
521,0.97,3437.934,3442.205,We'll come up with a draft for you.,76,,
522,0.97,3442.205,3445.141,Thank you so much.,77,,
523,0.97,3445.141,3446.843,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",78,,
524,0.97,3446.843,3460.39,"Councilmember Mosqueda, your thoughts are also recognized here and so I'll ask central staff to make sure to brief myself and other members of the committee before the next meeting.",79,,
525,0.97,3460.39,3474.304,"I think Councilmember Mosqueda asked one of the questions I had up which is understanding, asking them to describe why they need more time to address the water heating requirements.",79,,
526,0.97,3474.304,3486.816,I want to make sure we're making the differentiation in changing Timelines regarding what is already a common item on the market.,79,,
527,0.97,3486.816,3487.917,Heat pumps are already quite common.,79,,
528,0.97,3487.917,3492.222,It sounds like we may need more time for water.,79,,
529,0.97,3492.222,3494.39,Did I get that correct?,79,,
530,0.97,3494.39,3502.332,You did a good job.,80,,
531,0.97,3502.332,3502.832,Thank you.,81,,
532,0.97,3502.832,3504.167,"Maybe, Duane, or Micah or Ardel.",81,,
533,0.97,3504.167,3513.91,Can you tell me a little bit more about the outreach that was done to inform this proposal?,81,,
534,0.97,3513.91,3542.839,I can speak to the energy code part of it and last year we had eight public review meetings 2.3 hours long each where we handed out technical issues followed by long meetings with the Advisory board as well as proposals with two dozen organizations and hundreds or thousands of follow UPS.,82,,
535,0.97,3542.839,3552.382,I would say this holds the record for the most public outreach on a construction code ever.,82,,
536,0.97,3552.382,3560.056,I'm glad to have a record breaking piece of legislation before us.,83,,
537,0.97,3560.056,3560.59,This is great.,83,,
538,0.97,3560.59,3562.825,"I was going to say, this is Micah.",84,,
539,0.97,3562.825,3566.963,I could follow up a little bit with the other codes.,84,,
540,0.97,3566.963,3594.724,"Just in addition to that, this cycle, we went out and collaborated with many organizations throughout the state in the past there was some rumblings that Seattle does whatever they want and so in order to advance the codes together as a region, we went out and did a lot of collaboration throughout the state on the Eastside of the state, all over with the Washington Association of building officials and got their members on board with many of the significant changes.",84,,
541,0.97,3594.724,3600.663,That is why the state has adopted these changes and we're not just coming at you with these are all Seattle changes.,84,,
542,0.97,3600.663,3605.868,Majority of the changes that we highlighted today are at the state level.,84,,
543,0.97,3605.868,3610.44,So we're moving together as a region instead of just a city.,84,,
544,0.97,3610.44,3646.976,"Part of that was going out and, like I mentioned, we did over 250 meetings with all of the various organizations and holding all of these discussions on how to make the codes better as think they're done very well.",84,,
545,0.97,3646.976,3656.786,One of the questions I have here is regarding the electrical grid.,84,,
546,0.97,3656.786,3663.559,I can only imagine that the changes will increase the load on our electrical grid.,84,,
547,0.97,3663.559,3677.907,I can also assume that with energy efficiency both with the appliances that we have in our homes as well as the value of the new buildings that we're building that there will be savings there as well.,84,,
548,0.97,3677.907,3690.286,"Duane or Micah, could you speak to--does the city's current electrical grid have the capacity to handle the increased usage that would result from the entire standards?",84,,
549,0.97,3690.286,3698.795,I asked a representative to be on.,85,,
550,0.97,3698.795,3699.429,Are you there?,85,,
551,0.97,3699.429,3699.896,Yes.,86,,
552,0.97,3699.896,3700.196,Hi.,86,,
553,0.97,3700.196,3700.463,Thanks.,87,,
554,0.97,3700.463,3701.297,"Good morning, Julie.",88,,
555,0.97,3701.297,3708.738,I work at Seattle city light on our energy conservation program and new construction.,88,,
556,0.97,3708.738,3729.992,"In response to this question, we have been looking at the impact to our grid and exactly like you said, the buildings that are going to be going through this will have much lower energy use because of the energy efficiency requirements.",88,,
557,0.97,3729.992,3747.276,We definitely recognize that the code amendments that will shift the building Technologies using fossil fuels to electric may contribute to Localied impacts on part of our distribution infrastructure that we believe are manageable.,88,,
558,0.97,3747.276,3763.86,We're under taking an analysis of how electric of our transportation buildings to meet our city goals will look in a detailed way in 2021.,88,,
559,0.97,3763.86,3765.962,"Thank you, Julie.",89,,
560,0.97,3765.962,3770.099,"And thank you, Duane, for Teeing that, for having city light here.",89,,
561,0.97,3770.099,3770.5,I appreciate that.,89,,
562,0.97,3770.5,3777.44,My other two questions have already been asked by Councilmember Mosqueda and Councilmember Lewis.,89,,
563,0.97,3777.44,3783.212,I will hold those questions and welcome the amendments that you're bringing forward.,89,,
564,0.97,3783.212,3792.021,I'll just generally state that I believe that Micah had said something to this degree in his presentation or maybe it was Ardel.,89,,
565,0.97,3792.021,3794.69,"My apologies, you're all doing such great work.",89,,
566,0.97,3794.69,3804.6,The buildings that we're building today are going to out last our reliance on some of the Technologies that we have to heat our buildings today.,89,,
567,0.97,3804.6,3813.643,I think of the fact that many buildings we still use today in our city were originally built with steam as their heating source.,89,,
568,0.97,3813.643,3830.026,"While we no longer use steam, the way that those buildings were built, as Duane said, having to go do surgery on a building is more costly than if we were to build it the right way the first time.",89,,
569,0.97,3830.026,3835.731,"If we're going to meet the 2050 goals, we have to be making the changes today.",89,,
570,0.97,3835.731,3842.505,"I just want to thank everyone for Ardel, Duane, Micah, all of your great work.",89,,
571,0.97,3842.505,3849.645,"Julie for joining us, and Yolanda, for your great work, too.",89,,
572,0.97,3849.645,3860.623,"If there are no other questions, we will move onto the next item and we'll have the energy code and construction code changes before us at our next committee.",89,,
573,0.97,3860.623,3861.591,Vice chair Mosqueda?,89,,
574,0.97,3861.591,3862.758,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",90,,
575,0.97,3862.758,3869.232,What is the Timeline for us to work with central staff if there are amendments that we would like to pursue?,90,,
576,0.97,3869.232,3875.238,Before the next meeting would be most appreciated.,91,,
577,0.97,3875.238,3898.394,"On the original Timeline that we had anticipated the bill to have been introduced last week, we would have moved forward, voted out of committee next week, at the next committee meeting in two weeks, if we're still able to meet that Timeline, I would love to meet that Timeline, so if you could have that amendment before the next committee meeting, that would be great.",91,,
578,0.97,3898.394,3900.029,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",92,,
579,0.97,3900.029,3905.034,"Mr. chair, could I just --",93,,
580,0.97,3905.034,3905.301,Please.,94,,
581,0.97,3905.301,3925.554,"If we're going to make, especially the change to the water heating scope, it would be advantageous to do that really fast, like in the next couple of days, so there is time to get out to the local engineering community and make sure that we got it right.",95,,
582,0.97,3925.554,3926.355,"Thank you, Duane.",96,,
583,0.97,3926.355,3934.764,Allow the record to reflect that we need to move swiftly if we're working with the water.,96,,
584,0.97,3934.764,3945.608,"I believe what I heard from Councilmember Mosqueda--vice chair Mosqueda, and let me know if I'm wrong, that the water would not be included and you were focusing on the heat, the space heating is that correct?",96,,
585,0.97,3945.608,3958.754,"I think we're going to do follow up calls with some of the stake holders we heard from, and I hear of the desire to make sure others, how we pride ourselves on that in our office as you know.",97,,
586,0.97,3958.754,3979.141,"We'll make sure to work with you, Mr. chair, and then keep the Department up to date as well if there are any potential amendments to be worked and would absolutely want to make sure that the stake holder groups get a chance to weigh in and provide any feed back before any amendment would be introduced into your Committee.",97,,
587,0.97,3979.141,3980.476,Thank you for that reminder.,97,,
588,0.97,3980.476,3984.814,We'll go back to you pending the conversations.,97,,
589,0.97,3984.814,3985.147,Thank you.,98,,
590,0.97,3985.147,4000.796,"One last round of thank Yous to Ardel, Duane, Yolanda, Micah, really great work.",98,,
591,0.97,4000.796,4001.13,Thank you.,99,,
592,0.97,4001.13,4013.209,Next item of business is a public hearing and possible vote on Council bill 119978 which extends interim flood Plains regulations.,99,,
593,0.97,4013.209,4017.279,Read the abbreviated title into the record.,99,,
594,0.97,4017.279,4018.748,Council bill 119978.,100,,
595,0.97,4018.748,4029.191,"An ordinance relating to flood Plains, extending interim regulations for 12 months to continue to rely on updated national flood insurance rate maps.",100,,
596,0.97,4029.191,4031.527,Now I'm excited.,101,,
597,0.97,4031.527,4033.629,Flood Plains.,101,,
598,0.97,4033.629,4036.465,That is my jam!,101,,
599,0.97,4036.465,4038.367,Let's do this.,101,,
600,0.97,4038.367,4039.268,Excellent.,102,,
601,0.97,4039.268,4039.969,Thank you.,102,,
602,0.97,4039.969,4056.419,We're joined by Maggie glow week Yee Yak Glowacki.,102,,
603,0.97,4059.488,4062.992,We thought it would be before the last committee.,102,,
604,0.97,4062.992,4067.43,"That said, we're here which is why we'll hopefully take a vote on this today.",102,,
605,0.97,4067.43,4072.835,"Maggie, could you, after we hear a little bit from Maggie, we'll open the public hearing.",102,,
606,0.97,4072.835,4082.178,"Maggie, could you provide us a brief refresher for us before we open this public hearing?",102,,
607,0.97,4082.178,4090.786,"Maggie, you're on mute.",102,,
608,0.97,4090.786,4091.587,Sorry about that.,102,,
609,0.97,4091.587,4092.588,I am on mute.,103,,
610,0.97,4092.588,4092.922,Good morning.,103,,
611,0.97,4092.922,4096.125,Thank you for having me here today.,103,,
612,0.97,4096.125,4119.682,"I will provide an over view of the legislation to extend the interim flood plain regulations, so I will share my screen.",103,,
613,0.97,4120.85,4123.152,I do have a power point.,103,,
614,0.97,4123.152,4124.82,This is the power point I provided in December.,103,,
615,0.97,4124.82,4137.733,It is a short one and will provide the over view so that everybody is refreshed on the interim Floodplain development extension.,103,,
616,0.97,4137.733,4142.938,"I'll provide an over view of the proposal, reason for the extension.",103,,
617,0.97,4142.938,4150.379,The public outreach to date and our proposed next steps on the legislation.,103,,
618,0.97,4150.379,4159.788,"In July, city council passed and the Mayor signed ordinance 126113 establishing the interim flood plain development regulations.",103,,
619,0.97,4159.788,4182.578,"These contain the building codes and other standards that homes, businesses and people are safer through the Perit applications that provides the permits on property within the flood plain areas.",103,,
620,0.97,4182.578,4213.175,"Federal Emergency Management agency, otherwise known as FEMA, produced updated maps and established the minimum requirement standards for the regulations that were adopted as interim regulations regulations are due to expire on February 24th of 2021 if the regulations are not extended, property owners and FEMA flood plain areas may not be able to purchase flood insurance or renew their existing policies.",103,,
621,0.97,4213.175,4230.626,"The reason for the extension is that Sdci needs additional time to evaluate properties that are not met by FEMA, but are met by Spu as flood prone to determine if additional areas need to be included in the regulations.",103,,
622,0.97,4230.626,4239.635,"Also, public outreach and the environmental review for the permanent regulations have taken longer than we initially anticipated.",103,,
623,0.97,4239.635,4248.744,Here is an example of an area in South Park where they have this area mapped as flood prone but FEMA does not have this area.,103,,
624,0.97,4248.744,4264.26,We would like to make sure we include every area that we know of that is at risk to flooding so that the regulations applied to those areas as well.,103,,
625,0.97,4264.26,4275.504,Public outreach completed to date is that we do have a web page up and running that provides information on the interim regulations as well as our work on the permanent regulations.,103,,
626,0.97,4275.504,4287.149,On that page we have information for people to sign up to be on the E-mail list to be included on future public meetings on the permanent regulations.,103,,
627,0.97,4287.149,4302.197,"We have sent out 2,400 post cards to property owners in the map flood plain areas and so far we have over 360 subscribers to our E-mail list.",103,,
628,0.97,4302.197,4312.307,Our next steps will include public outreach that will include public meetings Online and additional updates to our Website.,103,,
629,0.97,4312.307,4328.457,We are currently working with Fpu staff to evaluate the areas that I talked about that are mapped as flood prone and we're working on developing the permanent regulations.,103,,
630,0.97,4328.457,4332.828,"If there are any questions, I can answer those questions.",103,,
631,0.97,4332.828,4333.896,"Thank you, Maggie.",104,,
632,0.97,4333.896,4341.737,I do not have any questions because I have asked them at the last time that we passed this interim flood plain regulation.,104,,
633,0.97,4341.737,4344.173,I also had questions at the last meeting.,104,,
634,0.97,4344.173,4349.445,All of my questions have been answered.,104,,
635,0.97,4349.445,4351.48,"Colleagues, any further questions for Maggie?",104,,
636,0.97,4351.48,4351.98,Councilmember Pedersen?,104,,
637,0.97,4351.98,4353.749,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",105,,
638,0.97,4353.749,4370.766,"For those who are tracking the new fiscal climate note, this legislation was initiated prior to the implementation of that which is why the fiscal NOTE does not discuss the adaptation issues impacted here like rising water levels, et cetera.",105,,
639,0.97,4370.766,4390.786,"Since this is just an extension of the interim regulations, we will look forward to that when we get the final regulations to review so we can consider the rising water levels due to climate change which will be answered through the adaptation question and the new climate note.",105,,
640,0.97,4390.786,4391.92,Thank you.,105,,
641,0.97,4391.92,4393.989,Thanks.,106,,

644,0.97,4396.625,4397.493,Thank you very much.,108,,
645,0.97,4397.493,4413.909,I'm wondering if we can put this presentation back up so I can see that map one more time.,108,,
646,0.97,4414.81,4415.01,Yes.,109,,
647,0.97,4415.01,4425.053,.,109,,
648,0.97,4426.355,4427.022,Thank you.,110,,
649,0.97,4427.022,4436.365,"In this area of the map, I'm trying to Orient myself here.",110,,
650,0.97,4436.365,4439.435,"Are we talking, is this the South Park area here?",110,,
651,0.97,4439.435,4439.668,Yes.,111,,
652,0.97,4439.668,4443.639,So this is in the South Park neighborhood.,111,,
653,0.97,4443.639,4443.872,Okay.,112,,
654,0.97,4443.872,4450.245,And these are homes and businesses then in the South Park area there.,112,,
655,0.97,4450.245,4450.712,That's correct.,113,,
656,0.97,4450.712,4450.913,Yeah.,113,,
657,0.97,4450.913,4451.113,Okay.,113,,
658,0.97,4451.113,4453.549,"And then with this, what was it?",114,,
659,0.97,4453.549,4465.394,"One or two weeks ago there, was an extremely high tide that we all saw pictures of that had water rushing over the walk way.",114,,
660,0.97,4465.394,4472.067,Did any of the high waters that day also affect this area?,114,,
661,0.97,4472.067,4481.91,So that is where Spu really keeps track of all of those areas that are impacted during the high tides.,115,,
662,0.97,4481.91,4490.586,We're working with Spu staff on all of those areas that they're mapping and keeping track of during extreme high tides.,115,,
663,0.97,4490.586,4491.053,Okay.,116,,
664,0.97,4491.053,4491.253,Great.,116,,

666,0.97,4493.689,4496.892,"Chair, this is just a slight diversion because the map is so powerful here.",117,,
667,0.97,4496.892,4508.37,"Do we also have those maps that show the rising tides and perhaps, you know, this ties into Councilmember Pedersen's longer term goal when we look at climate change.",117,,
668,0.97,4508.37,4514.776,I remember seeing maps about how the various neighborhoods of Seattle will be impacted if climate change is not mitigated.,117,,
669,0.97,4514.776,4522.818,Do we have those maps that we can also reference for folks as we continue to lift up policies like these?,117,,
670,0.97,4522.818,4531.927,"So, yes, again, Spu has these flooding maps as well as sea level rise maps.",118,,
671,0.97,4531.927,4544.373,"Again, I'm working with Spu staff to evaluate the data that they have to see what we can do as we move forward with our regulations and planning.",118,,
672,0.97,4544.373,4544.773,Thank you.,119,,
673,0.97,4544.773,4554.449,"We'll be able to get my hands on those maps one more time to refresh my memory on which neighborhoods we're talking about, though this affects everyone in the city and the region.",119,,
674,0.97,4554.449,4557.619,I appreciate you putting this back up there.,119,,
675,0.97,4557.619,4560.889,"Thank you, no additional question.",119,,
676,0.97,4560.889,4564.927,And I can also send a link to Fpu's Website.,120,,
677,0.97,4564.927,4574.903,It is a public Website where they have the flooding and the sea level rise maps so I can send that to you as well.,120,,
678,0.97,4574.903,4577.205,Thank you very much.,121,,

682,0.97,4582.644,4587.683,I just have a quick question on the map.,123,,
683,0.97,4587.683,4591.987,I remember seeing a map awhile ago.,123,,
684,0.97,4591.987,4597.326,"Are we included, the Unincorporated as well?",123,,
685,0.97,4597.326,4601.563,At this time it is only the areas within the city of Seattle.,124,,
686,0.97,4601.563,4614.943,"When it floods it doesn't know the difference between incorporated and Unincorporated, and I know that is an issue for the people who want to be, whether or not they want to be Annexed into the city of Seattle.",125,,
687,0.97,4614.943,4620.115,Is there a way or I'm guessing you have a map for the Unincorporated piece down in that area?,125,,
688,0.97,4620.115,4631.66,"There is where we could, Okay, if you're asking if we can get information on the area, yes, we can work with King County staff because I know they should have that information.",126,,
689,0.97,4631.66,4634.296,I have heard reference to it in conversations.,126,,
690,0.97,4634.296,4634.529,Yes.,127,,
691,0.97,4634.529,4638.667,I will--we can work with King County staff to get that.,128,,
692,0.97,4638.667,4653.949,"Because that was one of the issues on the environmental impacts and some of the questions coming up about Annexation in the neighborhoods, so I just want to see the whole picture Soef we have an idea of how to work with King County.",129,,
693,0.97,4653.949,4654.182,Okay.,130,,
694,0.97,4654.182,4670.832,"You know there, is money on the state side, on the county side, and the state side for the flood plain stuff and mitigation and all of these issues that come up from that area, so I just kind of wanted to see the whole picture.",130,,
695,0.97,4670.832,4673.702,You can Delineate what is within the city of Seattle limits.,130,,
696,0.97,4673.702,4690.886,"We also need to see how that will impact our folks that are not in the Annex but still use the same roads, resources, employment, same buildings, so if we could see that, that would be great, whenever you get a chance.",130,,
697,0.97,4690.886,4691.119,Okay.,131,,
698,0.97,4691.119,4696.358,I will do that.,131,,
