187,0.97,1091.824,1109.174,"And I know that the Tech executives, they want to paint a picture to their effort to get approval voting on the ballot as democratic, but just because they went through the checklist to get the support doesn't mean the effort has genuine community support.",54,,
188,0.97,1109.174,1121.186,"No one has debated approval voting in Seattle since before 2022--or before 2022 it's never been proposed, I has no civic or community group endorsing it.",54,,

190,0.97,1127.292,1140.506,They tried to buy their way to the ballot with out-of-state executives--believing they Úwere supporting Ranked-Choice voting.,54,,
191,0.97,1140.506,1148.247,So it's only fair this Council give us a real option with genuine support like Ranked-Choice voting.,54,,

216,0.97,1259.324,1280.278,"Also, Arecd is a critical reform for my district because it will help ensure people of color are still represented as Gentrification pushes people of color out of this district as well as the neighboring central district, the Poc voting blocks are removed, and so to make sure that those who are still here are represented, we need Ranked-Choice voting.",60,,

242,0.97,1363.628,1379.811,"I'm the civic engagement Organizer there, which basically means that I am the person in our organization on the ground working with communities encouraging voter education and encouraging folks to really use their voice and have their voices counted when it comes to election season.",66,,
243,0.97,1379.811,1413.712,"I'm speaking in support of Ranked-Choice voting and providing that alternative on the ballot to approval voting because I know that our communities are unaware that approval voting is different from Ranked-Choice voting, and we need an opportunity to provide a concrete opportunity for our community members to learn about alternative voting strategies and battle some of the apathy and disengagement that we see in local politics when black community members do not see their peers represented on--in elected Council.",66,,
244,0.97,1413.712,1419.484,"Thank you for your time, and please continue with Ranked-Choice voting at the city level.",66,,

250,0.97,1445.811,1456.888,"It's so extraordinary that the judges of King County that take no position on any political issue, much less an administrative issue, would come forward and do this, take this position.",68,,
251,0.97,1456.888,1468.967,And I think part of it might be because nowhere in King County has a park been completely closed to public access the way City Hall park has been and the way Ballard Commons has been.,68,,
252,0.97,1468.967,1478.877,"Ballard Commons has been closed for more than two years, first because it was taken over by a colony of Squatters and run as a criminal operation.",68,,
253,0.97,1478.877,1483.915,A fair amount of arson was going on as well.,68,,
254,0.97,1483.915,1488.72,Then it was closed for environmental radiation.,68,,
255,0.97,1488.72,1489.421,Now it's closed endlessly.,68,,
256,0.97,1489.421,1491.122,Our Park is not accessible to us at this time.,68,,
257,0.97,1491.122,1496.595,And think King county can do a better job of this.,68,,

267,0.97,1529.661,1539.437,And I'm speaking to say that I hope the Council will give voters a chance to weigh in on Ranked-Choice voting as an option in future elections.,70,,
268,0.97,1539.437,1548.713,"I think Ranked-Choice voting will better allow voters to express their will and to help combat polarization, which even happens here in Seattle.",70,,
269,0.97,1548.713,1559.424,Ranked-Choice voting allows voters to simply vote for the candidates they most prefer in order without having to worry about the most Electable candidates or against candidates they don't prefer.,70,,
270,0.97,1559.424,1566.965,"It better allows the will of voters to be expressed, and there's less to be gained.",70,,
271,0.97,1566.965,1569.834,Thank you for your time and consideration.,70,,
272,0.97,1569.834,1570.368,"Thank you, Dan.",71,,

276,0.97,1596.828,1611.376,"I think the Council for recommending sound transit conduct an additional six to nine months of community outreach, however, I am disappointed that this recommended outreach will only focus on the fourth and Fifth Avenue shallow options.",72,,

278,0.97,1616.514,1632.931,I ask the Council to amend the resolution to recommend that sound transit go back to the drawing board and find other station alternatives to the existing options that Prioritize historic preservation and keeping small businesses and residents in the neighborhood.,72,,
279,0.97,1632.931,1643.942,I also ask that the Councilmembers attend the next sound transit commit meeting to oppose the fourth and Fifth Avenue shallow options.,72,,

292,0.97,1698.63,1703.535,I did not get seriously involved in finding a solution until after the 2016 election.,74,,
293,0.97,1703.535,1719.851,"In researching what could be done, I realized that the voting systems used around the country, including our top two system, are the root cause of my frustrations, because they Incentivize elected officials and candidates to behave as they do.",74,,
294,0.97,1719.851,1732.263,I concluded that ranked choice voting is the only voting system that provides the right incentives and addresses my concerns.,74,,

315,0.97,1827.425,1834.332,I commend your interest in placing a Ranked-Choice voting alternative on the November ballot.,78,,
316,0.97,1834.332,1844.108,Ranked-Choice voting enables voters to rank their choices so you can optimize personal choice without jeopardizing your vote.,78,,
317,0.97,1844.108,1859.691,"Ranked-Choice voting admits that voters may hold several in high regard and can differentiate between multiple of them with Ranked-Choice voting, while you may not get your first choice, you still may get your second choice.",78,,
318,0.97,1859.691,1884.315,"Ranked-Choice voting avoids the yes for one, no for all the others of the current system and it avoids the undifferentiated yes, yes, yes possibilities for approval voting, which can very likely violate the constitutional rule of one person, one vote, as one voter could vote for five candidates and another for one candidate, and all votes would be weighted equally.",78,,
319,0.97,1884.315,1887.252,A lot of other cities have passed Ranked-Choice voting.,78,,

483,0.97,2605.97,2611.608,As noted in the central staff update yesterday this legislation is time sensitive.,165,,
484,0.97,2611.608,2620.617,"If the change is not made, the city attorney's office cannot prosecute misdemeanor violations of domestic violence and other orders.",165,,

488,0.97,2666.597,2673.737,"One of those statutes that had been adopted by reference was repealed, and its provisions were transferred to another state statute.",165,,
489,0.97,2673.737,2684.848,"So the substance of the state statute remained primarily the same, and the Rcw code number was changed.",165,,
490,0.97,2684.848,2687.384,This ordinance would reflect those numbering changes.,165,,
491,0.97,2687.384,2703.2,"The ordinance would adopt by reference part of state law that reflects enforcement and penalties for specific types of extreme risk protection order violations, which the city attorney's office, if adopted, could prosecute.",165,,
492,0.97,2703.2,2719.45,"And then Lastly, it would adopt by reference a section of the Rcw which details how the city attorney's office Prosecutes specific violations of Anti-Harassment protection orders already within its authority to prosecute under municipal code.",165,,
493,0.97,2719.45,2734.731,"So in order to ensure that the violations of domestic violence and other court orders could be prosecuted by the city attorney municipal court, our code needs to be amended to reflect this Rcw change as well.",165,,

575,0.97,3010.374,3020.484,"As we all know, this Voter-Approved expansion of light rail is a massive investment in the benefits of regional transit and will substantially impact communities throughout Seattle.",217,,

577,0.97,3031.828,3040.337,"At our Committee on June 7 we received a thorough presentation, had a robust discussion of that resolution, 32055.",217,,
578,0.97,3040.337,3047.144,"To provide more time for consideration, we scheduled our second meeting at our July 5 committee rather than June 21st.",217,,
579,0.97,3047.144,3053.25,On July 5 we amended the resolution and our committee passed it unanimously.,217,,
580,0.97,3053.25,3057.22,"As we confront the climate crisis, we want more people to ride transit.",217,,
581,0.97,3057.22,3072.269,I recognize there's a strong desire to make sure the design and construction of this mega project builds in flexibility for future expansion options beyond sound transit three and to make sure the experience for transit riders is streamlined and efficient.,217,,
582,0.97,3072.269,3084.314,"To address those two issues, it's important to note that the resolution currently States that the principle of financial stewardship includes, quote, Prioritizing future expansion opportunities in planning and design.",217,,
583,0.97,3084.314,3104.401,"Also due in part to the concerns raised by several community leaders about the fifth Avenue option, today's Resolutin acknowledges that more time and community engagement are needed before making generational decisions that impact the China Town/International district.",217,,
584,0.97,3104.401,3109.106,And the resolution shows we favor shallow options instead of the deep options that add travel time.,217,,
585,0.97,3109.106,3118.548,I want to thank my colleagues for their engagement on this resolution and the expertise and care they brought to the table for their districts and for our city.,217,,
586,0.97,3118.548,3126.49,"I'd like to thank the executive, especially Sarah, Marshal foster, and the Mayor's office for their collaboration on this resolution.",217,,

588,0.97,3134.798,3140.804,"Ultimately, all of these decisions will be made by the sound transit board that represents King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties.",217,,
589,0.97,3140.804,3147.844,But the city of Seattle will continue as the most populous and most supportive Lynch pin for the entire transit system.,217,,
590,0.97,3147.844,3159.556,"Time is money, and Seattle will be asked to expedite construction approvals to make sure the entire system expansion and its massive benefits for the region happen as quickly as possible.",217,,
591,0.97,3159.556,3173.57,I'm hopeful that the thoughtful preferences on routes and stations expressed by the Seattle resolution will be helpful to sound transit in achieving our mutual goal of quickly expanding light rail within our city and across our region.,217,,
592,0.97,3173.57,3173.87,Thank you.,217,,
593,0.97,3173.87,3174.337,"Thank you, chair.",218,,

596,0.97,3186.583,3187.651,Thank you so much.,219,,
597,0.97,3187.651,3207.337,"I also would like to extend my thanks to chair Pedersen for his collaborative approach to developing this resolution and incorporating his colleague's feedback, colleagues who are working to represent our constituents.",219,,
598,0.97,3207.337,3209.239,I won't repeat all of my comments from committee.,219,,
599,0.97,3209.239,3221.284,"I do want to note that the resolution includes a clear statement of support for the medium tunnel option, for the West Seattle junction in line with strong community support for a tunnel in the junction.",219,,
600,0.97,3221.284,3228.124,A tunnel would have significantly less impact on residents and businesses.,219,,
601,0.97,3228.124,3230.327,"For Delridge, there's no clear community census.",219,,
602,0.97,3230.327,3238.768,The draft EIS is clear that all alignments have impacts on residents and businesses.,219,,
603,0.97,3238.768,3245.909,"You know, the del five and six options were developed to minimize impacts on the Youngstown community adjacent.",219,,
604,0.97,3245.909,3255.652,"But they were added late in the Scoping process at the board level, so potential impacts of these options weren't discussed during the Scoping process.",219,,
605,0.97,3255.652,3274.404,And so perhaps that might be why the draft Deis failed to note the existence of the Alki Beach Academy day care center as a potentially impacted social resource and did not fully analyze the project's impact on child care centers.,219,,
606,0.97,3274.404,3285.015,Another impact would be transitional resources offering 24/7 services to people with serious mental illness through both living facilities and a service center.,219,,
607,0.97,3285.015,3288.418,"They depend on 24-hour a day, seven day a week services.",219,,
608,0.97,3288.418,3296.559,The Holistic system in the draft EIS does not address the integrated nature of the program.,219,,
609,0.97,3296.559,3313.61,"For these reasons, the committee amended including a statement that the city is not able to state a preference for the del ridge station given the inadequate analysis of impacted social resources.",219,,
610,0.97,3313.61,3326.79,"And the state, the future support of the city for a Delridge option is dependent on relocation of impacted child care and transitional housing service providers.",219,,
611,0.97,3326.79,3337.067,"So you know, we're saying there's no preference now, but we're setting the bar for what we would need to see in order to be able to support a preference.",219,,
612,0.97,3337.067,3357.854,"I really appreciate the executive's addition to an earlier draft version of the bill requesting specifically a transit access study for the communities identified in the racial equity tool kit, including South Delridge and white center, and also adding mention of the important protections for Longfellow Creek.",219,,
613,0.97,3357.854,3364.461,"These are great additions, and I'm really pleased that the executive added them early.",219,,
614,0.97,3364.461,3372.102,And I encourage folks to lend their support to Councilmember Pedersen's fine legislation.,219,,
615,0.97,3372.102,3376.339,Thank you.,219,,
616,0.97,3376.339,3378.074,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",220,,

620,0.97,3383.213,3396.926,Really looking forward to voting on this resolution today and appreciate the process and the ability to participate in the deliberations on the resolution even though I'm not a member of the relevant committee.,221,,
621,0.97,3396.926,3421.751,"The implications of sound transit three are amazing and at the same time offer a lot of challenges to District seven in particular and this resolution addresses those challenges that have been expressed by important Stakeholders representing cultural, economic, and sporting interests in the area.",221,,
622,0.97,3421.751,3447.944,"We have Crafted recommendations in this resolution that address preserving the viability of our strong and robust Maritime economy in the salmon Bay area and throughout Interbay, preserving the cultural institutions and important public infrastructure in the uptown neighborhood, particularly around the Seattle center campus.",221,,
623,0.97,3447.944,3472.936,And I look forward to continuing to have these discussions with sound transit on Aligning their final planning priorities with the values that are expressed and the priorities that are expressed in this resolution and appreciate the opportunity to have gotten a lot of that feedback manifested in the four corners of this.,221,,
624,0.97,3472.936,3477.273,And I know it's been appreciated by a lot of the constituencies in district seven.,221,,
625,0.97,3477.273,3481.044,So looking forward to voting yes on this.,221,,
626,0.97,3481.044,3482.912,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",222,,

629,0.97,3483.913,3493.056,And now is the chance to thank the sponsor and my good friend from district one out here for all the work that they did.,223,,
630,0.97,3493.056,3495.558,So let me repeat some of the things I was starting to say.,223,,
631,0.97,3495.558,3499.162,"I want to thank the chair, Councilmember Pedersen.",223,,
632,0.97,3499.162,3504.434,Thanks for your work in spearheading this solution to reflect the many needs and priorities of the city and our communities.,223,,
633,0.97,3504.434,3543.706,"It was our pleasure, as well, within our office and thanks to Erin house for the work they did with central staff and Seattle Department of transportation along with community partners like Seattle subway to be able to make sure that the resolution as introduced included future expansion opportunities, references to making sure that the refined South Lake Union station location best served the surrounding community, and for the Ballard location, requested that sound transit consider Ridership impacts and the location of housing, employment, and industrial areas.",223,,
634,0.97,3543.706,3547.31,And really appreciate the amendments that were made in the transportation committee.,223,,
635,0.97,3547.31,3560.356,"While I'm not a member of that Committee, I want to thank Councilmember Herbold, and with the support of the chair, Councilmember Pedersen, for the Wok that they did to continue to improve the legislation in front of us today.",223,,
636,0.97,3560.356,3575.505,"And as Councilmember Herbold noted, recognizing that the draft EIS put together by sound transit didn't have the full analysis necessary to look at Healthcare providers, child care providers, and impact to the surrounding community.",223,,
637,0.97,3575.505,3601.431,"And to make sure that as we create our next integrated mass transportation system that we're thinking about how do we preserve and help promote the preservation of existing businesses, including child care and health services, by either maintaining their location or ensuring that they are able to relocate to an area nearby without losing the ability to serve the community.",223,,
638,0.97,3601.431,3611.374,Because those are the exact types of services that we want around new sound transit stations to make sure that the development that we're creating is truly Transit-Oriented.,223,,
639,0.97,3611.374,3624.053,We want to make sure there's amenities like child care and health services around housing and other higher opportunity options in all neighborhoods sound transit serves.,223,,
640,0.97,3624.053,3637.3,I look forward to continuing the conversation about avoiding or mitigating the impacts of relocation or needs in the area as we think about housing as well as these other social services that we need.,223,,
641,0.97,3637.3,3657.62,"So I look forward to the next conversations, and I really think that the city is sending a strong message here today about the importance of, yes, creating mass transit, creating our sound transit connected to all communities throughout Seattle, and as we do so looking at the important things that we need in order to be a thriving, healthy community.",223,,
642,0.97,3657.62,3665.395,"And that includes health services, child care, housing, and so many other necessities located next to our new sound transit station.",223,,
643,0.97,3665.395,3684.614,"So thanks for all the work you did to really promote what Transit-Oriented development should look like in the legislation in front of us and to take into account really unique needs across our city, including for our youngest Kiddoes and future generations.",223,,
644,0.97,3684.614,3688.384,"Well said, Councilmember Mosqueda.",224,,
645,0.97,3688.384,3692.321,"Colleagues, any other comments?",224,,
646,0.97,3692.321,3693.556,"Councilmember Nelson, please, welcome.",224,,

648,0.97,3700.797,3702.865,Thank you very much.,225,,
649,0.97,3702.865,3708.638,As well as Calvin chow from central staff and Sarah at Sdot.,225,,
650,0.97,3708.638,3722.085,"So I approached this from the perspective of a citywide city council that must consider the needs of all of Seattle, and the reality is that no alignment or station location comes without challenging impacts.",225,,
651,0.97,3722.085,3736.232,But it's critical that we position ourselves as a city well when it comes to future work with sound transit staff and as the sound transit board goes into its own deliberations.,225,,
652,0.97,3736.232,3749.078,"So of course I'm going to vote in favor of this resolution today, weighing all the pros and Cons as a citywide elected, truly believing that this put our best foot forward in this process.",225,,
653,0.97,3749.078,3753.182,So thank you very much.,225,,
654,0.97,3753.182,3756.052,"Thank you, Councilmember Nelson.",226,,
655,0.97,3756.052,3758.287,"Colleagues, I'll share my comments now.",226,,
656,0.97,3758.287,3771.534,The amendments that were accepted unanimously by the committee is to note that 14th alignment is unacceptable without a station entrance West of 159.,226,,
657,0.97,3771.534,3780.376,We should Re-Open analysis West of 15th to 22nd to identify cost savings now that the high bridge is not an option due to the Coast Guard's ruling.,226,,
658,0.97,3780.376,3791.921,"15th Avenue is our preferred alignment, and there are Cost-Saving opportunities available to us as compared to what sound transit staff have put forward.",226,,
659,0.97,3791.921,3803.866,If we shift to looking at using right of way rather than private property or shifting the station a block North or South to use private property there.,226,,
660,0.97,3803.866,3808.437,We need to connect our light rail spine to Tacoma and Everett as fast as possible.,226,,
661,0.97,3808.437,3811.474,And I'm committed to seeing that through.,226,,

663,0.97,3821.017,3826.222,I'm here to assist with any Cost-Saving option in Ballard.,226,,
664,0.97,3826.222,3829.425,I can show you where they are.,226,,

675,0.97,3902.131,3913.609,"This is why 15th Avenue Northwest is the preferred alignment, and we need grade separated connection if 14th Avenue is going to be considered.",226,,
676,0.97,3913.609,3925.421,"Again, as always, I am committed to seeing this project through to Tacoma and to Everett, and we have to understand that we have to do our part here in the city and sound transit.",226,,
