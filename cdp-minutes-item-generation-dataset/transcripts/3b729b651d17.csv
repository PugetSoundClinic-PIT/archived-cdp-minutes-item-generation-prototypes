24,0.97,345.244,350.717,Any party who made a timely protest of assessments in the hearing Examiner's initial hearing would file an appeal in the final report with the clerk.,4,,

28,0.97,376.776,389.088,"Because some appeals were filed for only the initial report, some only for the final report, and some for both, the total amount of Appeals shown on the indexes attached to the central staff memo adds up to more than 71 appeals as a shared--.",4,,
29,0.97,389.088,407.306,The appeal of the initial report and the appeal of the final report are considered together here today as a completed appeal for any unique hearing examined case number.,4,,

36,0.97,451.517,468.367,"An important reminder to my colleagues, we hold these hearings publicly so we can discuss quasijudicial matters openly so please feel free to engage in conversation and ask questions as we move through the review process.",4,,

52,0.97,545.411,555.321,"I did, as you know, the central staff memo, the member that is prepared, the testing agenda and I provided it to all of you in this meeting.",9,,
53,0.97,555.321,558.424,The indexes attachment one and two are already covered.,9,,
54,0.97,558.424,571.637,I will mentioned there are background history piece is attachment number three and attachment number four provides a reference to the entire record formed to the Seattle hearing Examiner.,9,,
55,0.97,571.637,574.24,I will give a little orientation for waterfront L.E.D.,9,,
56,0.97,574.24,582.648,Assessment for the record and for the public committee that we are reviewing now and in the future.,9,,
57,0.97,582.648,588.254,"Via ordinance 125760, city ordered the preparation of the final assessment role for the waterfront L I.D.",9,,
58,0.97,588.254,601.2,And it is helpful to understand the final assessment role for any local improvement district is a listing of all properties in that L I.D.,9,,
59,0.97,601.2,606.605,With the amount to be assessed against each property and it is based on the increase in value accruing to each property called the special benefit.,9,,
60,0.97,606.605,615.114,That is attributable to the construction of those local--there are specified local improvements for this waterfront L I.D.,9,,
61,0.97,615.114,640.873,"There are parts of the overall central waterfront program, namely they are the promenades--the Pioneer square Pre- Street improvements, the Union Street pedestrian connection, the pipeline strips great improvements in each property.",9,,
62,0.97,642.475,646.045,Overall the total cost is $737 million and the estimated cop with the lad improvements is $347 million.,9,,
63,0.97,646.045,647.813,"Of that, the modified waterfront L I.D.",9,,
64,0.97,647.813,655.654,Assessment would find $160 million plus approximately $15.5 million in financing costs of the L I.D.,9,,
65,0.97,655.654,661.427,"City, state and philanthropic findings round out the total budget.",9,,
66,0.97,661.427,664.563,I would just keep going on.,9,,
67,0.97,664.563,673.673,"I see your questions, fantastic.",9,,
68,0.97,673.673,682.548,"A supporting no, the role of the hearings in this, the city council does admit that the Seattle--Examiner to conduct the waterfront--to hear objections from viewers, presentations from the city and to provide a recommendation to city council.",9,,
69,0.97,682.548,708.307,"The center conducted the hearing every 4TH, 2020 about 430 property owners of the more than 6200 properties subject to the assessments paid timely objections to the Examiner and the Examiner conducted the hearing and excuse me, and then for what we call the initial report of the Examiner, he filed that on September 8th, 2020.",9,,
70,0.97,708.307,714.313,"And as charity described, some of those properties were remanded for further review.",9,,
71,0.97,714.313,730.529,That analysis was conducted by the city Appraiser . The Examiner held a hearing on those and then wrote up the final report which was recommendations on those remanded properties as well as consolidating all of the other recommendations for the initial report.,9,,
72,0.97,730.529,741.64,"Finally, I would like to talk about the standard review and the scope on the decisions on those appeals.",9,,
73,0.97,741.64,755.821,For the Seattle municipal court review of Committee on appeals shall be limited to and based solely upon the record from the hearing although the committee may permit written or oral arguments confined to the content of the record for the hearing and for the committee today like on March 2ND.,9,,
74,0.97,755.821,759.225,You will have opportunity--no opportunities for written or oral comments is provided.,9,,
75,0.97,759.225,764.93,The county's rules provide for that.,9,,
76,0.97,764.93,769.068,The hearing Examiner's decision Selby accorded substantial weight and the burden of establishing the--upon the appealing party.,9,,
77,0.97,769.068,776.642,Both the revised--of Washington and the Seattle code divide that.,9,,
78,0.97,776.642,786.886,"After hearing appeals the city council me set assessment rolls, revise, raise, lower, change, modify the role or any part thereof.",9,,
79,0.97,786.886,790.689,Or set aside the role or the assessment to made in over or a new.,9,,
80,0.97,790.689,801.066,"Then recommendations of Council limited to those options to approve or approve of commissions, modify remainder deny the appeal.",9,,
81,0.97,801.066,804.403,In this case there are a number of Appeals and each one receives its own decision.,9,,
82,0.97,804.403,821.62,After the committee votes on recommendations for action on these appeals the Council central staff will appear up--Memorialize that decision.,9,,
83,0.97,821.62,826.892,-- not appeal final assessment role without reviewing or deciding upon all that--hearing Examiner's recommendation on the final assessment role.,9,,
84,0.97,826.892,837.836,"And with that, I will end my presentation and accept any questions and turn it back over to--.",9,,
85,0.97,837.836,838.437,Thank you.,9,,
86,0.97,838.437,861.86,"Before we do that, just a week got this clear on the record for those who haven't been involved in this project for many years, thank you for the memo that you did that dated March 31st with the four attachments when the indexes in there and the memo and the history--I think that is attachment three, the back count on the waterfront lead.",10,,
87,0.97,861.86,893.192,"So basically for those viewing and those who are still learning about this, it is Online and you can certainly get to it and the memo that Eric prepared with with the attachments of all the appeals and also the background on the waterfront lid and the assessment and all the links to the ordinances, the final special benefits study, the resolutions, the clerk files are all there.",10,,
88,0.97,893.192,907.206,"We had the opportunity to go that's why wanted to make sure the public knew and people know who were watching her will be watching know that all this information was sent to all of us Council on our Committee on March 31st, 2021 with the four attachments so that, if there are any questions or discussions for my colleagues?",10,,
89,0.97,907.206,908.407,Okay.,11,,
90,0.97,908.407,918.25,"Not seeing any, here no--I'm sorry, council member--Councilmember Herbold?",11,,
91,0.97,918.25,928.394,"I understand that as chair, you are empowered to not take testimony.",12,,
92,0.97,928.394,935.267,"This is a very different type of a quasijudicial interaction and I am familiar with it, having served in the past on the land use committee.",12,,
93,0.97,935.267,950.449,"Where we did here, within the confines of what we are--that of--of what only is on the record but we would hear from the Appellants and the opposition to the Appellants.",12,,
94,0.97,950.449,966.632,"The thing I'm trying to get my brain around his what makes--this is--this agenda, this meeting is noticed as a hearing.",12,,
95,0.97,966.632,968.667,What makes it a hearing if we are not hearing anything?,12,,
96,0.97,968.667,971.57,Let me say something and I will let Eric answer some of that.,13,,
97,0.97,971.57,972.171,Thank you.,14,,
98,0.97,972.171,1026.125,"So when we started two years ago is that we have a choice and I made the choice to hire a hearing Examiner instead of a committee and city Council to listen to all of these appeals and then they put a report together so I felt it was important to have an actual attorney hearing Examiner, not Committee, not city council listen to the appeals and make a record and that is actually what happened and then we probably didn't know all this but then we received a 600 page binder of all the appeals and the decision by the hearing Examiner and all that is in Eric's memo as well but I will let Eric explain to you why this is a different kind of hearing for cross eyed judicial while we do take public comment because these are the appeal so they have had their day in court so to speak and we are looking at what the hearing Examiner decided in the last two years and Eric, can we add to that about exactly what we are doing here today?",15,,
99,0.97,1026.125,1042.641,"I think you bubbly, I can go on and on but I will let you--make I'm just really narrowly, I just feel like I understand some of this just because of my understanding of quasijudicial and I understand this is different but one my specific question is what makes this meeting that we are having right now a hearing?",15,,
100,0.97,1042.641,1043.041,Great.,16,,
101,0.97,1043.041,1044.143,Thank you for the question.,16,,
102,0.97,1044.143,1058.057,"So as I mentioned before, the committee may take oral testimony and written argument as part of the hearing and sort of a more ordinary or customary way that you think of but may not.",16,,
103,0.97,1058.057,1060.626,"In this case, the record was formed before the hearing Examiner.",16,,
104,0.97,1060.626,1080.712,"The appeals that were filed, of the hearings Examiner's recommendations, some 70 one of them, those are, before you all and they present the complaint or argument or objection to the hearing Examiner's decision for each one of those things to the Council.",16,,
105,0.97,1080.712,1101.7,"So the hearing because it is quasijudicial, the time for the committee to be here in a transparent, public way to say we recognize these appeals and the hearing Examiner office decision in a moment where we can all sort of, in terms of being fair, do it in a public forum.",16,,
106,0.97,1101.7,1106.872,So that it what it makes it a hearings appeal.,16,,
107,0.97,1106.872,1118.083,"And the court file that is attached to this agenda is not just an index of all the appeals, is that correct?",17,,
108,0.97,1118.083,1126.992,They also include like a link through to the materials associated with the appeals?,17,,
109,0.97,1126.992,1127.826,"Yes, that is correct.",18,,
110,0.97,1127.826,1161.326,"This is kind of a, so as the appeals came in, historically and I won't go into all the details but sort of the back end process that the city adopted and as you recall sort of notified the coming in so those were available but in order to make number one available to the public and sort of accessible and transparent to this process, the city clerk was really great about preparing individual folders for each appeal so that and then we organized them by day and because these appeals were scheduled for particular days.",18,,
111,0.97,1161.326,1170.569,So that information is available Online but has been available longer than the existence of those files.,18,,
112,0.97,1170.569,1175.574,"Eric, when do we close the date on the appeals the one where the clerk gave notice?",19,,
113,0.97,1175.574,1177.943,Mix so there were two appeal periods.,19,,
114,0.97,1177.943,1181.647,There was one for the initial report and there was one for the final report.,19,,
115,0.97,1181.647,1199.765,The final report was filed--recounted to 15 days on the final report from February 1 so there is about two weeks for people to file those appeals.,19,,
116,0.97,1199.765,1203.902,So is this a docket that I was looking at where we printed it it would've been 3000 pages?,20,,
117,0.97,1203.902,1218.784,"Yeah but each appeal, when we get to each appellate and there are a number of different ways to reference the materials and some of the Appellants, the appeals are longer because they might have included the entire final report for example of the hearing Examiner and their exhibits.",21,,
118,0.97,1218.784,1222.487,Some other Appellants might have chosen a different way.,21,,
119,0.97,1222.487,1241.84,As long as they submitted those materials needed to take them in and call it their appeal--so if you were to just print them all out you might print some of those things many times so the final report for example for the appeals of the final report might appear over and over and over again.,21,,
120,0.97,1241.84,1248.013,So it ends up being many pages because of that but --,21,,
121,0.97,1248.013,1248.614,A lot.,22,,
122,0.97,1248.614,1250.249,There you have it.,23,,
123,0.97,1250.249,1252.117,I guess I will just stop there.,23,,
124,0.97,1252.117,1255.053,Maybe that answers the question?,23,,
125,0.97,1255.053,1255.253,Yep?,23,,
126,0.97,1255.253,1255.654,Okay great.,23,,
127,0.97,1255.654,1256.655,"Yes, I think so.",24,,
128,0.97,1256.655,1257.055,Anything else?,24,,
129,0.97,1257.055,1258.123,All right.,24,,
130,0.97,1258.123,1260.826,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",24,,
131,0.97,1260.826,1264.863,"That's a good question so with that, I'm not hearing further questions.",24,,
132,0.97,1264.863,1283.548,I'm closing the hearing on the appeals to the findings and recommendations by the hearing Examiner that we hired in the final assessment role for waterfront lid and for the District 6751 filed in the clerk file under 321914.,24,,
133,0.97,1283.548,1286.585,Okay so I'm closing the hearing.,24,,
134,0.97,1286.585,1287.552,Did that.,24,,
135,0.97,1287.552,1291.556,Okay.,24,,
136,0.97,1291.556,1300.198,"Now, Eric, let's see, the committee has the complete record of this matter before it and has considered all appeals of the hearing Examiner's recommendations for the final assessment of the waterfront L I.D.",24,,
137,0.97,1300.198,1311.276,"So Eric, the next step is can you walk us to the next steps that the committee has completed their review of the appeals courts that we have completed the review of the appeals, correct?",24,,
138,0.97,1311.276,1337.803,"That's correct so with these two hearings having been opened and heard and closed, the committee now may take action on the appeals and the action is to make a recommendation to the Council on the appeals and then to affirm or not affirm, your choice, right, the final assessment role as recommended by the hearing Examiner.",25,,
139,0.97,1337.803,1350.348,"Okay so we are at--if there any questions, we are at the juncture where we have closed the hearing and so I'm going to make a motion here in a moment but are there any other discussions?",26,,
140,0.97,1350.348,1350.682,Or questions?,26,,
141,0.97,1350.682,1353.952,Okay.,26,,
142,0.97,1353.952,1373.872,If there are no further discussions than I move the committee recommend that the appeals and the clerk files 321893 and 321 914 be denied and to approve the final assessment role for the L I.D.,26,,
143,0.97,1373.872,1381.98,Local improvement district number 6751 with the revisions recommended by the hearing Examiner . is there a second?,26,,
144,0.97,1381.98,1382.347,Second.,27,,
145,0.97,1382.347,1394.393,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen, my vice chair.",28,,
146,0.97,1394.393,1399.564,So the motion has been moved and Seconded to deny the appeal in the clerk files as stated and to approve the final assessment role.,28,,
147,0.97,1399.564,1400.999,Are there any other comments?,28,,
148,0.97,1400.999,1401.533,Councilmember Herbold?,28,,
149,0.97,1401.533,1434.132,"Sorry to be a pain in the Patootie here--when I was looking at the agenda and having this sort of question of you know, what does it mean to be a hearing, I also--the meeting is noted for--and discussion so I was not aware that there was going to be an action and I'm not, I'm just, I'm not expressing any discomfort with taking action.",29,,
150,0.97,1434.132,1438.203,I'm just asking sort of the question of procedure.,29,,
151,0.97,1438.203,1446.645,"Whether or not we needed to be, this agenda needed to be noticed as an action item?",29,,
152,0.97,1446.645,1454.252,"Aren't you glad you brought that up because I had a discussion with my vice chair, Mr. Pederson.",30,,
153,0.97,1454.252,1463.361,"When you look under items of business and you say as Councilmember Pedersen pointed out, the committee may consider and take possible action.",30,,
154,0.97,1463.361,1480.045,"And we may take action and consideration if somebody wasn't ready to vote and take action but that is why we use the word ""May ."" do you see that.",30,,

156,0.97,1481.079,1482.747,I'm looking at the Non-Pdf version of your agenda.,31,,

158,0.97,1483.348,1490.589,And I do see by looking on the Pdf that additional languages included that is not included in the sort of E form for the agenda.,33,,
159,0.97,1490.589,1490.856,Okay.,34,,
160,0.97,1490.856,1497.462,If you were to look at the actual Pdf on page --,34,,
161,0.97,1497.462,1498.697,"I got it now, yes.",35,,
162,0.97,1498.697,1517.315,"Okay and I'm glad you brought that up because Councilmember Pedersen had the same concern and so that is why we used the word ""may consider to take possible action ."" that's why we made sure all of our colleagues got the court file and all the information before it goes to full Council--but it has to come out of committee first, as you know.",36,,
163,0.97,1517.315,1520.619,"Is there anything else you want to add to that, Eric are you Okay, Councilmember Herbold?",36,,

167,0.97,1536.801,1539.237,"Now I lost where I was at so a motion was Seconded, right?",36,,
168,0.97,1539.237,1542.641,"The motion was moved, we had a second, there were comments, Councilmember Herbold made a comment.",36,,
169,0.97,1542.641,1552.851,"With that, not hearing anything else, with the clerk please call the roll on the denial of the appeals and approval of the final assessment role for local improvement district 6751.",36,,

178,0.97,1607.405,1627.926,"So now that we have done that part, next is we have to take additional steps to make this record so in anticipation of a possible vote which we have done, with the result today, I requested that central staff can prepare a preliminary draft of the findings, conclusions and decision of Council on this matter.",40,,
179,0.97,1627.926,1633.398,The document will be the written record on this matter.,40,,
180,0.97,1633.398,1638.737,"Counsels adoption of the findings, conclusions and decision, number one, what approve the final assessment role for the L I.D.",40,,

183,0.97,1651.983,1663.762,"So at this point, Eric, can you please distribute electronically--because you guys haven't seen this until now, the drafted findings and conclusions and decision and briefly walk us through the document?",40,,
184,0.97,1663.762,1673.638,"So the reason we held that back, I had it ready to go this way so Eric, can you do that now and let us know when you have transmitted that?",40,,

192,0.97,1726.925,1732.831,I see that Councilmember Pedersen is looking at his screen intently to let us know when he sees it.,42,,
193,0.97,1732.831,1736.634,"Maybe Councilmember Pedersen, as my vice chair, can raise his hand.",42,,
194,0.97,1736.634,1739.971,I cannot switch screens.,42,,
195,0.97,1756.287,1756.554,Okay.,43,,

204,0.97,1833.932,1841.239,"This is what we had kind of queued up in anticipation either way for the findings and conclusions and decision so with that, Eric, do you want to walk us through this?",48,,
205,0.97,1841.239,1843.341,Make sure.,48,,

207,0.97,1848.947,1851.549,The beginning as a background.,48,,
208,0.97,1851.549,1860.225,"Sometimes, you can think of this as sort of like the recitals on a bill or resolution.",48,,
209,0.97,1860.225,1864.362,The information would be very familiar because it has lots of shared information.,48,,
210,0.97,1864.362,1872.737,"You would also see in the back on document, this attachment number three but it is important to have this year to get context to this document.",48,,
211,0.97,1872.737,1880.645,"And if you don't mind, just kind of stepping through, you can either go page by page or roll down.",48,,
212,0.97,1880.645,1881.479,That would be great.,48,,
213,0.97,1881.479,1889.187,"Let's go to I think it is going to be page 2, we will go through one at a time?",48,,
214,0.97,1889.187,1890.521,This continues in the background.,48,,
215,0.97,1890.521,1891.489,Thank you for bearing with me.,48,,
216,0.97,1891.489,1898.496,"Page 3, please.",48,,
217,0.97,1898.496,1911.509,"The bottom of page 3 is the findings of fact and notes that the Council ADOPTS the following findings of fact as stated in the hearing and final report January 29, 2021.",48,,
218,0.97,1911.509,1916.114,That is official language saying we agree with all the things that the Examiner based decisions on so we can continue on.,48,,
219,0.97,1916.114,1917.115,This conclusions here.,48,,
220,0.97,1917.115,1946.811,"And these round out all this sort of pieces to this dealing with standard review, from the hearing Examiner, made decisions of supported Maturate and also noting the Council's conclusions about the appellant's arguments and they failed to demonstrate whether assessment was fundamentally, was done in a fundamentally wrong bases are it was arbitrary.",48,,
221,0.97,1946.811,1950.848,The last bit if you just go down and thanks for doing so much for this.,48,,
222,0.97,1950.848,1973.237,"The final decision is the final assessment role for the local improvement District with the hearings as the hearing Examiner approved, the language you did verbally and it shows the Council's decision on each of these appeals Referenced by case number and this goes on for a few pages because each appeal is it own unique thing and this written document needs to show them separately.",48,,
223,0.97,1973.237,1974.072,And that rounds it out.,48,,
224,0.97,1974.072,1989.387,"There is a signature line on the last page for the Council President after this, is if this should go under Council with your recommendations and there is a place for the President to sign that after Council's final action on it.",48,,

228,0.97,2007.005,2007.805,I don't believe so.,50,,
229,0.97,2007.805,2010.308,So what is going to be a few more weeks out?,51,,
230,0.97,2010.308,2018.116,"Yes, a few more weeks out is what we decided because we want to give everybody an opportunity to see this and look at the record before it goes to full Council for the final vote?",52,,
231,0.97,2018.116,2024.789,"That is right in this document is an important attachment to--it rides along with the future final assessment role ordinance that is manifested in that way, too.",53,,
232,0.97,2024.789,2035.199,"Right so this is--and on the list here, in the clerk files, that is all linked as well to today's hearing, correct?",54,,
233,0.97,2035.199,2040.204,"Yes, there are number of files shown in the final decision document.",55,,
234,0.97,2040.204,2045.843,There are no--electronically ..,55,,
235,0.97,2045.843,2076.474,They correspond with our draft findings . and--conclusions of loss but he is it is the final conclusions and decision so they don't go to a full council vote and all of my colleagues in the public will have access to this and have a look at it and as I said if you print all this out it was over 3000 pages but some of us had to look at this so I will leave it at that.,55,,
236,0.97,2076.474,2081.546,"Colleagues, please, this is, if there is anyone who has any questions, this would be the time to ask before I move further.",55,,
