180,0.97,1164.263,1179.044,I'm a district 6 resident and a small business owner and I'm calling to say that the city should not be responding to systemic inequality and the lack of this with blaming individuals in crisis.,43,,
181,0.97,1179.044,1188.52,Recidivism is nearly guaranteed when people are forced into the criminal legal system and later released to an unchanged or worse and economic situation.,43,,
182,0.97,1188.52,1199.765,"To prevent harm, this community should focus on equitable community led investments and not on notions of increased police and come only operating by threatening or Perpetrating violence.",43,,
183,0.97,1199.765,1208.941,You should center the injustice is that low income residents face like wage theft and work on getting basic needs met.,43,,
184,0.97,1208.941,1215.28,"In the meantime, I would rather stabilize them and let business owners haul themselves up by their Bootstraps.",43,,
185,0.97,1215.28,1220.152,We should not base policies on a hand select few business owner opinions.,43,,
186,0.97,1220.152,1229.461,I do not like that public dollars are spent on this discussion today which will Prioritize the profits of capital owners sitting at the table.,43,,
187,0.97,1229.461,1242.975,"Thank you very much and next, Michelle and then David Haynes.",44,,
188,0.97,1246.078,1253.018,Michelle is not present.,44,,

192,0.97,1271.536,1277.476,We are having more diminished behavior with less mental health support and patrols on the street.,45,,

194,0.97,1280.746,1287.786,"We know these people and most of them, including those living on the streets do not commit these bad behaviors.",45,,
195,0.97,1287.786,1288.987,Let's not blame an entire group for the property damage.,45,,
196,0.97,1288.987,1304.536,"Instead, please put government money into grants to help small businesses to rebuild, especially those that have been the victims of ongoing assault.",45,,
197,0.97,1304.536,1309.374,We've spent thousands of Unreimbursed dollars at a time when the revenue is down more than 50% for two years.,45,,
198,0.97,1309.374,1321.653,"Instead of blaming Unhoused people, we've asked the Well- off people to turn off computers, get out of their houses and come down town to their local shopping district and walk around and make eye contact.",45,,
199,0.97,1321.653,1325.857,Smile and laugh.,45,,

205,0.97,1374.106,1391.89,It's obviously inept sabotaging unqualified political police chief does more favors for the criminal underworld with his leadership and the law-abiding communities.,47,,
206,0.97,1391.89,1398.964,The police chief thinks it's more important to relationship building and law-abiding citizens being piloted by the community to believe the real problem is homelessness.,47,,
207,0.97,1398.964,1413.145,They get blamed for the payday for cops while they never demand an investigation.,47,,

236,0.97,1618.249,1627.659,We have been treated very poorly in regard to lots of hostility and having our staff accosted.,52,,
237,0.97,1627.659,1640.872,"A lot of similar comments have been said by the business owners and the residents in North Seattle and the Seattle market, in general.",52,,
238,0.97,1640.872,1651.149,"Currently, we have landlords that don't want to do anything about safety and they say that we have to Externalize it and pay for it ourselves.",52,,
239,0.97,1651.149,1659.19,"The market, in general, has made it that we have heavily question whether or not Seattle is going to be the long-term place that we want to continue to be at.",52,,
240,0.97,1659.19,1671.67,We've asked the city Council to really review the police and safety and health professionals so we can get a safe city.,52,,
241,0.97,1671.67,1677.475,We don't currently have that.,52,,

250,0.97,1708.073,1722.02,We have a lot of low income and affordable rentals in the South Seattle area and we've always felt like our communities have been the dumping grounds for issues in the city but it's rampant in most neighborhoods these days.,55,,
251,0.97,1722.02,1728.193,The newest result of crime in our city is the Redlining taking place with our insurance.,55,,

254,0.97,1746.444,1766.231,We really question how small businesses will exist in Seattle if the city is not taking accountability for the issues . We offer basic human needs two people that need low income housing and we do our best but we need more support and we hope all of our tenants can remain safe.,55,,

294,0.97,2085.316,2097.995,"We have taken walking tours in Columbia city and the U district and Belltown and we've heard from not just business owners, but Nonprofits, art Venues struggling with many of the same interests.",62,,
295,0.97,2097.995,2099.53,Thank you for taking the time.,62,,
296,0.97,2099.53,2100.965,I am hearing and listening to you.,62,,
297,0.97,2100.965,2109.407,Let me be clear that this is a crisis.,62,,
298,0.97,2109.407,2120.218,These issues that we are hearing are escalating and they are intensifying and becoming brazenly disruptive to businesses and dangerous to staff and customers.,62,,
299,0.97,2120.218,2134.065,I want to raise the level of importance of this issue and the urgency that we hear these stories and think about some recommendations we can make right now.,62,,
300,0.97,2134.065,2148.045,"We all know that crime is a hugely complex issue and even having more officers on the street won't cut it because even before there was such a staffing shortage, there did not seem to be enough to start addressing rising crime well before the pandemic hit.",62,,
301,0.97,2148.045,2174.438,"I want to thank Mayor Harrell and chief Diaz and Scoggins for participating in the press conference last week where the executive made clear the commitment to address this issue and I look forward to working with them and, perhaps, our city attorney, to put things in place that can make a difference right now.",62,,
302,0.97,2174.438,2193.257,"I was struck when my staff was talking to businesses and Nonprofits in our tours and individually and with phone calls, et cetera.",62,,
303,0.97,2193.257,2194.825,"Yes, there is property damage and Break-Ins and repeat vandalism, arson.",62,,
304,0.97,2194.825,2206.27,These things are creating situations that these businesses are thinking there is almost no way to remain viable in our city.,62,,
305,0.97,2206.27,2226.39,One common thread in these conversations is that this is not just about property . These small employers have mentioned assaults on their employees and threats and entering with Gunpoint.,62,,
306,0.97,2226.39,2231.629,I want to refine or nuance this topic because it's not about business or property crime.,62,,
307,0.97,2231.629,2235.7,It's about violent crime.,62,,
308,0.97,2235.7,2246.744,That is another reason I am raising the urgency . The impact on human beings.,62,,
309,0.97,2246.744,2257.388,I want to make the point and respond a little bit to the Commenters that question why we are having this discussion in this Committee.,62,,
310,0.97,2257.388,2284.815,"We've received Emails that are saying this committee should be focused on investing in the Bipoc business community to ensure equitable access to capital, assisting businesses struggling from two straight years of reduced customer traffic due to the pandemic and ensuring businesses are not displaced by higher rent, et cetera.",62,,
311,0.97,2284.815,2292.089,"Those items are in my 2022 work plan that will be finalized very soon and we are not, not focusing on these issues.",62,,
312,0.97,2292.089,2312.41,"However, businesses are closing and we've recently heard that our office had people talking about vacating tomorrow and they cite rising crime and threats to employees as the reason they are leaving.",62,,
313,0.97,2312.41,2320.818,We are losing businesses and their tax revenue and we are losing gathering places that are the nodes of our neighborhoods and communities and we are losing jobs.,62,,
314,0.97,2320.818,2327.525,We are losing livelihoods.,62,,
315,0.97,2327.525,2334.231,Public safety is key to economic recovery and that is precisely why we are having this conversation in this Committee.,62,,
316,0.97,2334.231,2354.919,"I will be working with colleagues who want to dig in on the ways that the things we hear today are relevant to their community and I welcome collaboration with them and with the executive, to come up with solutions in the very near term that can help.",62,,
317,0.97,2354.919,2378.109,"We recognize that crime is an extremely complicated issue and we won't be able to arrest our way out of this issue, even if we had an adequately staffed SPD Department . I would like to now turn it over to our Emcee, the President of the University district partnership.",62,,
318,0.97,2378.109,2387.351,He will call on panelists to introduce themselves and then run us through the agenda that we've got before us.,62,,
319,0.97,2387.351,2389.019,There will be ample time for Councilmembers to ask questions and make comments.,62,,
320,0.97,2389.019,2406.737,"This is a session where we are trying to have a productive conversation around things we can do right now and these are the experts on the front lines of what's happening across the city and that's why I'm getting a seat at the table, to have their expertise going forward.",62,,
321,0.97,2406.737,2416.514,"With that, I am pass the baton to don Blakeney.",62,,
322,0.97,2416.514,2417.181,Take it from there.,62,,

325,0.97,2420.351,2436.367,We appreciate you and the other committee members taking the time to hear this important discussion about economic impact related to the crime we've been hearing about and the behavioral health issues we are experiencing in Seattle small businesses and our business district.,63,,
326,0.97,2436.367,2452.283,"Sharing their stories, it's important that we elevate this and a shared understanding of what's going on.",63,,

499,0.97,4083.212,4094.19,"In preparing my comments, I reviewed past statements and it is so frustrating that I could have pulled out any one of those previous speeches and given it today.",79,,
500,0.97,4094.19,4098.094,The issues affecting public safety in Sodo remain the same.,79,,
501,0.97,4098.094,4102.598,"The severity, frequency and impact has gotten much worse.",79,,
502,0.97,4102.598,4120.249,"In 2015, when I spoke about a business broken into four times in the previous month, I couldn't imagine I would be here before you today to tell you I'm a business in Sodo broken into more than 20 times in a single month.",79,,

505,0.97,4148.11,4157.887,Even a traditional building structure hasn't kept some of our businesses safe and the methods of entry are getting more daring every day and harder to guard against.,79,,
506,0.97,4157.887,4172.201,"Along with the normal broken window with this, we've seen thieves cutting holes to gain entry.",79,,

510,0.97,4208.804,4215.611,What is most frustrating about this situation is that we know the name of the most prolific metal thief.,79,,
511,0.97,4215.611,4226.989,"He was caught in the Act and charge for the Prosecutor's office filed felony charges and because of his criminal history, recommended he remain in jail until his hearing.",79,,

514,0.97,4244.139,4252.414,He failed to show for possession of a stolen vehicle and for the January 20th hearing on the burglary charges.,79,,
515,0.97,4252.414,4262.891,"To give you context, just one of these burglaries, the loss to the business is in excess of $20,000.",79,,
516,0.97,4262.891,4270.566,We know his name and he has felony warrants out for his arrest and we still can't get him off the streets.,79,,
517,0.97,4270.566,4278.54,I had to be much more actively involved in the process in a way and never needed to.,79,,

527,0.97,4339.268,4349.978,"As most people know with movie theaters, we are busy with this coming in.",81,,
528,0.97,4349.978,4369.732,"We were broken into in August of last year and it caused $6000 to replace all the doors on the outside . two weeks later, we had a really big movie come in and we were broken into again.",81,,
529,0.97,4369.732,4377.606,"It cost us a lot of money and we were down a few days, as well.",81,,
530,0.97,4377.606,4391.019,We've already started working on limited hours on the governor's policies because of the pandemic.,81,,
531,0.97,4391.019,4399.795,We've had limited capacity of people coming into our theater and that means our revenue is down even more just from the Covid aspect.,81,,
532,0.97,4399.795,4411.173,"That on top of the closed mental health issues, we've had people in front of a bus stop in front of our doorway.",81,,
533,0.97,4411.173,4424.453,We've had people able to yell at our customers and we've had someone punch one of our customers before.,81,,
534,0.97,4424.453,4434.363,"We've had things spilled on customers, saying they're going to kill them and we've had customers running in fear into our theater.",81,,
535,0.97,4434.363,4441.403,We now have our doors locked and we invite people in one at a time so we can make sure we keep the safety of our guests in the building.,81,,
536,0.97,4441.403,4458.554,"I've gotten phone calls of racial threats and as well, physical threats that they would shoot us because we didn't answer the phone and weren't open for business.",81,,
537,0.97,4458.554,4477.272,"These are all things unique to a movie theater because we actually are--we are usually open seven days a week but we had to reduce the amount of Timewe are open . This actually does pertain to what this Committee is for, too.",81,,
538,0.97,4477.272,4488.584,What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to be the owner of the Ark lodge.,81,,
539,0.97,4488.584,4493.689,We have a plan to buy the building so we are able to stay in the community we've been in the last 10 years.,81,,
540,0.97,4493.689,4509.404,"My family can then keep it going with a person of color, I think that I've had struggles, as far as equality and being able to finance and everything.",81,,
541,0.97,4509.404,4521.25,"A lot of groups that are Bipoc, they have people that are grant writers and to grant writing and stuff.",81,,
542,0.97,4521.25,4525.32,I'm a single person that is a small business owner.,81,,
543,0.97,4525.32,4526.722,"For me to get financial help, I'm competing with Conglomerates.",81,,
544,0.97,4526.722,4529.057,That's not fair.,81,,
545,0.97,4529.057,4540.702,We are looking at the equality of bringing people to look at the small businesses.,81,,
546,0.97,4540.702,4543.405,They don't have the grant writers.,81,,
547,0.97,4543.405,4545.44,They are trying to do something special.,81,,
548,0.97,4545.44,4546.708,I can generate a lot of revenue and we had plenty of employees.,81,,
549,0.97,4546.708,4557.452,We have 300. we can't ensure we will have the same thing when they leave from our business to go to their cars.,81,,
550,0.97,4557.452,4575.537,One of the things the Council should really look to do is making it where metal recycling is something that businesses are responsible for.,81,,
551,0.97,4575.537,4578.44,You have to own a business to recycle metal.,81,,
552,0.97,4578.44,4582.311,"In California, you had to have a driver's license.",81,,
553,0.97,4582.311,4590.619,"In Virginia, anything over a certain amount, you had to present your driver's license and you had to wait a week before you could collect the money.",81,,
554,0.97,4590.619,4608.17,"That rate, the businesses that are broken into can make sure you get they get the metal back to the proper people instead of just benefiting criminals . hold them accountable to reduce the crime everywhere else.",81,,
555,0.97,4608.17,4608.87,Thank you.,81,,
556,0.97,4608.87,4617.212,But thank you for sharing that information.,81,,
557,0.97,4617.212,4627.556,"I will go last and I won't take too long because we had eight colors from the University district to talk about what they were seeing, including a business that lost all their inventory, a beauty supply store.",81,,
558,0.97,4627.556,4632.661,"Really tragic, honestly.",81,,
559,0.97,4632.661,4635.33,"You know, I want to give a couple of Statistics from our neighborhood over the last few months.",81,,
560,0.97,4635.33,4648.677,We have 150 food and service businesses here and the majority are owned by women and people of color.,81,,
561,0.97,4648.677,4655.717,"We have seen that with the pandemic, we live and die with a population of the students at the University of Washington.",81,,
562,0.97,4655.717,4659.521,We were the first and most Hard- hit neighborhoods during the pandemic.,81,,
563,0.97,4659.521,4663.892,Uw went Online to teach classes and that was the immediate impact to the neighborhood.,81,,
564,0.97,4663.892,4672.667,Our customers dried up right away and we were one of the fast to come back because we had a light rail station open and students came back to campus.,81,,
565,0.97,4672.667,4678.874,"There was hope in the air and we had lines at restaurants again, super exciting.",81,,
566,0.97,4678.874,4690.352,"Then, to see this escalation through the fall and the winter of the issues we are talking about, it puts a damper on that recovery and makes it even harder.",81,,
567,0.97,4690.352,4701.296,"The past few weeks, alone, we've seen 25 storefronts get broken windows and some of that is from folks with behavioral health disorders and they get into Altercations with the business owner.",81,,
568,0.97,4701.296,4708.637,Some is Smash-And-Grab in the middle of the night and people taking merchandise or cash.,81,,
569,0.97,4708.637,4710.172,That can happen more than once to a single business and that's tragic.,81,,
570,0.97,4710.172,4718.346,"We've heard about several random assaults and high profile robberies, including three Carjackings over the last week.",81,,
571,0.97,4718.346,4735.931,We've seen--we learned about businesses not getting insurance to cover the issues they are seeing or have been told the neighborhood is too risky for insurance policies.,81,,
572,0.97,4735.931,4739.901,That's an interesting version of Redlining that our businesses are excluded from those policies.,81,,
573,0.97,4739.901,4750.312,"We witnessed over 40 arson attempts in this neighborhood, mostly in our alleys with Dumpsters on fire and completely melting to the ground.",81,,
574,0.97,4750.312,4751.246,Some have cut adjacent buildings on fire.,81,,
575,0.97,4751.246,4767.095,"We lost building from people living at the seven Gables theatre, the historic building that caught fire over a year ago and we lost that building.",81,,
576,0.97,4767.095,4787.649,Countless hours of staff time working on connecting dots and working with city palm partners and they came for a walk to hear about what was going on and thank you Councilmember Nelson and Pedersen with the city attorney and representatives from the Mayor's office and the chief of police.,81,,
577,0.97,4787.649,4810.338,There is a genuine interest to dig into these issues and I think we've heard that there is a lack--we've heard about repeated issues and the lack of coordination between victims and city resources compounds the impact for Geographic- specific areas.,81,,
578,0.97,4810.338,4821.95,We've heard about the lack of prevention strategies with social services and Problem- solving have the outside impact on our neighborhoods and we've heard the lack of SPD capacity is felt dramatically in neighborhoods.,81,,
579,0.97,4821.95,4832.394,"At the University we had a foot patrol up until two years ago and the minute it left, it felt different in the neighborhood and we've seen escalation with these issues.",81,,
580,0.97,4832.394,4843.004,Some neighborhoods are talking about how they are particularly Burnable and had required different strategies and something applied across the city.,81,,
581,0.97,4843.004,4870.465,"We are here today and want to talk about a set of specific recommendations for the city to consider with the impact in our neighborhoods and this spring and your, the recommendations are not meant to be exhaustive, but they are meant to be pragmatic and meant to address the gaps we see and our community and the recommendations look to focus on the chaos in our neighborhoods that we are seeing and offer coordination and follow-up and accountability with a path forward to work on these things together.",81,,
582,0.97,4870.465,4876.004,I will start off by saying that this idea of coordination is really important.,81,,
583,0.97,4876.004,4882.41,We are putting forward a recommendation and we have community safety Hub Coordinators in neighborhood districts.,81,,
584,0.97,4882.41,4908.47,This is the time were neighborhoods and volunteers and business owners are trying to understand if one person is breaking into five businesses or an individual experiencing homelessness has lost touch with their case manager and gets aggravated because they get into an altercation with a customer and something bad happens.,81,,
585,0.97,4908.47,4914.342,This stuff happens day in and day out but there is no person on the city side that has the capacity or has been asked to focus on this.,81,,
586,0.97,4914.342,4929.991,We think there are high levels of chaos and incidents is Impacting small businesses and customers and we see there is a role for coordination.,81,,
587,0.97,4929.991,4938.133,The safety Hub coordinator could understand the issues like the University district to have an impact by connecting dots in the neighborhood.,81,,
588,0.97,4938.133,4940.335,We are with this person live?,81,,
589,0.97,4940.335,4941.269,To be determined.,81,,
590,0.97,4941.269,4952.814,Maybe this person could share information with the police and work with the outreach partner to track down someone that could switch neighborhoods and isn't on the radar to get the help they need.,81,,
591,0.97,4952.814,4968.129,That level of personal understanding makes a huge difference with community based solutions for public safety and the person Doesn'Tneed to carry a gun or wear a badge but could have a big impact and help different agencies looking at this issue to have a deeper impact.,81,,
592,0.97,4968.129,4979.841,"Along the same lines, to have this person have that cross jurisdiction authority, we need a dedicated person in the Mayor's office to focus on crime and Street-Level disorder.",81,,
593,0.97,4979.841,4993.355,"These issues always come down to a conversation between Hst, human services, Seattle police, the city attorney and the King County Prosecutor's office and our contracts with outreach workers with treatment services.",81,,
594,0.97,4993.355,5000.528,"Or, just neighborhood outreach, depending on a city project that needs to be pulled in.",81,,
595,0.97,5000.528,5017.879,These departments have incredibly different missions and the overwhelming priorities for each line of business but we need that level of cross departmental coordination to make progress on these issues when we see something systemic that needs to be changed.,81,,
596,0.97,5017.879,5020.882,I will take it over to Mike Stewart for the idea about high visibility foot patrols.,81,,
597,0.97,5020.882,5021.082,Mike?,81,,
598,0.97,5021.082,5028.99,Thank you.,82,,
599,0.97,5028.99,5029.457,Sorry.,83,,
600,0.97,5029.457,5043.004,We are going into in depth in some of these recommendations but I want to have a brief moment if there are Councilmembers with any particular questions or want to make a comment before we move on.,83,,
601,0.97,5043.004,5059.854,I want to note that the recommendations you will be hearing will be posted on the Seattle Legistar Homepage and on my Website and they will be Referenced in links and social.,83,,
602,0.97,5059.854,5062.991,What you hear will be available for the public and for other Councilmembers.,83,,
603,0.97,5062.991,5063.291,Thank you.,83,,

608,0.97,5083.845,5086.514,Thank you all for being here.,84,,
609,0.97,5086.514,5105.133,"I want to let you know that we hear you and that I'm not insulated from what you've described because I've been working with many small businesses and people in the community, not just in Ballard, but across D6.",84,,
610,0.97,5105.133,5111.172,We need more response and just police and police time can be focused on crime.,84,,
611,0.97,5111.172,5119.047,That's the aspect of the police because we need more mental health first responders and more CSO's and neighborhood coordination.,84,,
612,0.97,5119.047,5127.989,I was happy to champion to understand we need more of them and more dedicated to our city.,84,,
613,0.97,5127.989,5137.699,I'm clearly aware that we have organized criminal activity in our city and some of it is hiding behind homelessness.,84,,
614,0.97,5137.699,5150.111,It's very clear to me that we need to interrupt organized enterprise and behavior and stand up for the version of the program and we need to address homelessness with adequate shelter and the time and relationships it takes to get folks inside.,84,,
615,0.97,5150.111,5172.3,I want to take this moment and I've heard it's a pleasure to get to work with many of you and I will continue working with you.,84,,
616,0.97,5172.3,5180.341,"For all of us in our community, thank you.",84,,
617,0.97,5180.341,5181.376,Thank you.,85,,
618,0.97,5181.376,5182.777,"Seeing no other questions, we can go to the next Speaker.",85,,
619,0.97,5182.777,5183.144,"Go ahead, Mike.",85,,
620,0.97,5183.144,5186.748,"Thank you, Councilmember.",86,,
621,0.97,5186.748,5198.226,"Continuing with a couple with potential solutions to elevate, as don mentioned.",86,,
622,0.97,5198.226,5209.237,High visibility foot patrols and neighborhood business districts need the foot patrols and don't necessarily have to be sworn officers with a badge.,86,,
623,0.97,5209.237,5210.138,There's a lot of examples to pull from.,86,,
624,0.97,5210.138,5223.151,"These Tams would remain in specific, high traffic Geographies and could build relationships and trust with the community and more specifically, here are things they could do.",86,,
625,0.97,5223.151,5238.833,"With the foot patrols, they would reestablish a walking foot patrol with neighbor districts, first and foremost on the potential to De-Escalate the mild to moderate crisis situations without the involvement of SPD and when it hits that point, we need our law enforcement agency to assist.",86,,
626,0.97,5238.833,5252.046,Bring in human resources to problem solve or support when necessary.,86,,
627,0.97,5252.046,5262.223,High visibility jackets with presence and with relationships to build trust with community Stakeholders while providing an unarmed safety solution.,86,,
628,0.97,5262.223,5276.437,"Spot trends and issues requiring further investigation in a coordinated response and, potentially, offer a great recruiting ground for SPD to address the ongoing feeling of abandonment and chaos in our neighborhood business districts.",86,,
629,0.97,5276.437,5285.947,"This position, this role could work very, very closely with the community safety Hub Coordinators don Referenced earlier and most certainly with business district leadership, S well.",86,,
630,0.97,5285.947,5293.554,The second piece is SPD emphasis patrols.,86,,
631,0.97,5293.554,5304.532,It bears mentioning that the strategies we've outlined thus far can provide an effective lower cost and faster to scale strategy that will enhance public safety in neighborhood business districts.,86,,
632,0.97,5304.532,5308.87,By no means do they completely remove the dire need for support from Seattle police.,86,,
633,0.97,5359.02,5361.723,C1.,86,,
634,0.97,5361.723,5363.791,And break that pattern.,87,,
635,0.97,5363.791,5405.967,"Because currently there really aren't a lot of mechanisms available to disrupt criminal patterns and a combined approach of SPF Emesis with these new resources we think will make a significant positive impact for our neighborhood districts and at a basic level, interrupting criminal activity before it happens allows us to reduce the number of arrests Incarcerations, it limits SPF involvement on lower level crimes and reduces the strain on on the criminal justice system.",87,,
636,0.97,5405.967,5406.4,So thank you.,87,,
637,0.97,5406.4,5408.569,"I'll turn it back to you, don.",87,,
638,0.97,5408.569,5409.303,"Thank you, Mike.",88,,
639,0.97,5409.303,5415.777,Not he everything can happen before we get to the impacts we see.,88,,
640,0.97,5415.777,5427.255,So something she has been experimenting with the support of the city Maybe we could expand this year to help businesses getting Vandalized.,88,,
641,0.97,5427.255,5432.026,The idea we are bringing you today is the broken window and damaged store front Fund.,89,,
642,0.97,5432.026,5444.705,"With neighborhood business districts seeing a major increase in vandalism broken storefront windows and doors as well as late night smash and grab burglaries, we have an opportunity to build a program to play a role in funding those repairs.",89,,
643,0.97,5444.705,5456.35,The broken window fund is the program that the alliance has been implemented about a year ago.,89,,
644,0.97,5456.35,5469.163,To much success with outside funding and O Ed recently matched dollars to give out dozens of window facade and repair grants.,89,,
645,0.97,5469.163,5472.733,This is one of our most successful programs people have a true appreciation for.,89,,
646,0.97,5472.733,5490.251,It is a major cost for owners to absorb and on top of any stolen cash or merchandise and it is a straightforward easy to implement immediate response.,89,,
647,0.97,5490.251,5491.986,Back to you.,89,,
648,0.97,5491.986,5492.553,Thank you.,90,,
649,0.97,5492.553,5503.598,Some of these issues intersect with the back end of the insurance industry.,90,,
650,0.97,5503.598,5503.865,I think.,90,,
651,0.97,5503.865,5511.339,You heard from several folks today about the challenges of insurance Affordability and access in Seattle.,91,,
652,0.97,5511.339,5515.276,And I had heard a number of anecdotal stories.,91,,
653,0.97,5515.276,5530.458,But also have DOM to understand that many times businesses routinely choose not to report crimes because they are afraid of losing their insurance or that their rates will increase astronomically.,91,,
654,0.97,5530.458,5541.569,So some of the stories businesses told me in 2019 they had 10 companies to choose from but now they only have three and the offered insurance is way more expensive with much higher deductibles.,91,,
655,0.97,5541.569,5553.547,"One of the busy spoke to now does not report to insurance for anything under $30,000 in damage and this is not a large business.",91,,
656,0.97,5553.547,5562.757,In the District as don mentioned businesses have been told they don't qualify for insurance simply because they operate in the District and it is not a safe area.,92,,
657,0.97,5562.757,5563.257,This is unacceptable.,92,,
658,0.97,5563.257,5567.962,Access to insurance is a key part of running a business.,92,,
659,0.97,5567.962,5577.004,"And we feel very strongly that you know, these anecdotal stories tell us a lot, but we don't know the whole picture.",92,,
660,0.97,5577.004,5585.313,The city needs to study this issue to better understand the impacts of our current public safety crisis on small business Ford built and access.,92,,
661,0.97,5585.313,5602.897,"A study could look at insurance rates and availability across the city and test for geographic equity across neighborhoods and any disproportionate burdens being placed on small businesses, specifically businesses owned by women and people of color.",92,,
662,0.97,5602.897,5604.832,"Thank you, Erin for sharing that.",93,,
663,0.97,5604.832,5609.103,I'm going to hand it back to Council member Nelson.,94,,
664,0.97,5609.103,5611.739,These were our ideas we put forward.,94,,
665,0.97,5611.739,5614.475,We can have a discussion now and hear other ideas.,94,,
666,0.97,5614.475,5626.954,Thank you for letting us have the floor here today and to share these experiences and ideas with you at your Committee.,94,,
667,0.97,5626.954,5627.488,You are on mute.,94,,
668,0.97,5627.488,5632.96,I wanted to follow-up on what Erin said for two reasons.,95,,
669,0.97,5632.96,5647.742,"Number one, because there is a Misperception that property crime is not on the rise, it is because people are not reporting precisely because we don't want our premiums to go up or lose our coverage all together.",95,,
670,0.97,5647.742,5652.98,"So that is a fundamental problem and I want to, and I think this is a very good idea.",95,,
671,0.97,5652.98,5668.195,"Also I wanted to make the point that when we are talking about a broken window, I don't know if you all know how much that, I mean the public knows how much it costs to replace that, but it is at least $1200.",95,,
672,0.97,5668.195,5670.464,And it goes up from there.,95,,
673,0.97,5670.464,5675.069,"When that happens repeatedly to a business, that is a lot of money.",95,,
674,0.97,5675.069,5681.609,"So in isolation, folks might not think that is a big deal, but that is expensive.",95,,
675,0.97,5681.609,5682.643,It takes time.,95,,
676,0.97,5682.643,5690.818,"And it creates you know, a lack of security until that window is fixed.",95,,
677,0.97,5690.818,5692.186,In addition there is a glass shortage.,95,,
678,0.97,5692.186,5702.43,At the same time that we have a plywood explosion in plywood prices and also shortage.,95,,
679,0.97,5702.43,5708.069,We toured Bell town and all the windows at Patagonia were broken.,95,,
680,0.97,5708.069,5710.137,They replaced them with high carbon windows.,95,,
681,0.97,5710.137,5712.239,I don't know if that is Bulletproof.,95,,
682,0.97,5712.239,5712.907,But that is really expensive.,95,,
683,0.97,5712.907,5717.812,So I think this is important for two reasons.,95,,
684,0.97,5717.812,5724.685,"Number one, because reporting is not happening because people aren't submitting claims if they don't have to.",95,,
685,0.97,5724.685,5727.421,And I'm going to please indulge me for this one idea related.,95,,
686,0.97,5727.421,5753.414,"This is not on the list, but an idea that I have thought of this you know, people aren't reporting through the traditional going to the other line form at SPD, or if it is above a certain value, they must call an officer to take a statement and that can take many, many hours.",95,,
687,0.97,5753.414,5773.4,"I believe a big thing we could do is to add a section on our find it fix it, so that these reports can be, so they can at least be documented in an easy, fast way that there could be documentation regardless of the cost of the crime.",95,,
688,0.97,5773.4,5785.98,But that that will provide information to the deployment of officers and it will help what other liaisons we might have at the city to really track what is going on.,95,,
689,0.97,5785.98,5788.315,So I'm going to put that forward.,95,,
690,0.97,5788.315,5791.752,I have heard this has been positively received by some of you.,95,,
691,0.97,5791.752,5802.363,That is just one idea I came up with all by myself that could also serve the purpose of making sure that we raise the visibility of this issue.,95,,
692,0.97,5802.363,5802.563,Okay.,95,,
693,0.97,5802.563,5803.197,Those are my comments.,95,,
694,0.97,5803.197,5810.371,"And we will go into, don, if I'm correct, a Question-Answer period?",95,,
695,0.97,5810.371,5813.44,So would any of my colleagues like to ask a question?,95,,
696,0.97,5813.44,5825.853,Or would any of the panelists like to add anything or talk to each other.,95,,
697,0.97,5825.853,5827.788,"Yes, council member Debora Juarez.",96,,
698,0.97,5827.788,5828.989,"Thank you, Madam chair.",97,,
699,0.97,5828.989,5846.707,"First I want to thank you for having this time, I have been on Council six years and I don't think we have ever had an opportunity, particularly, since what we have all dealt with this since 2020 of the pandemic, a recession in the social upheaval.",97,,
700,0.97,5846.707,5854.381,And I think the pandemic really we revealed and peeled back the inadequacy and inequality that we see.,97,,
701,0.97,5854.381,5870.231,"In respect to your Committee for economic development and listening to public comment and taking notes, I truly do believe that this issue should be and we cannot pretend it doesn't exist that public safety is a core element of economic recovery.",97,,
702,0.97,5870.231,5887.114,"We have heard from business and his we have been hearing from businesses not just from the pandemic but also from the not all protesters and some protesters caused major damage to the Seattle public library to the tune of well over $400,000.",97,,
703,0.97,5887.114,5887.548,And to businesses.,97,,
704,0.97,5887.548,5907.568,"And so I am just grad that we are providing an opportunity to hear businesses speak, and not be quick to Demonize them and demoralize them or accuse them of Criminalizing or unsheltered relatives.",97,,
705,0.97,5907.568,5915.242,As business owners big and small they absorb these costs and insurance don't always pay for these costs.,97,,
706,0.97,5915.242,5944.438,"I know just from the District and Greenwood and other neighborhoods that it is a shame for us to walk through our city and see boarded, broken windows, boarded up windows, empty buildings, vacancies, when I used to chair the waterfront, we know their waterfront and the business is a magnet for economic development for businesses and jobs and hotels and retail and tourism.",97,,
707,0.97,5944.438,5954.415,"So normally, if this was four years ago, I would have been questioning why are we kind of doing public safety within the economic development real Areign in?",97,,
708,0.97,5954.415,5962.122,But I think that we are not being honest with ourselves and our city when we Don'Tnd that those two are linked and that we have to address that.,97,,
709,0.97,5962.122,5987.815,"And that we have small business owners and I particularly liked, I'm sorry if I forget your in my opinion, the young woman who owns the art gallery that talked about how important it is to have if the traffic, and clean doorways, and just to provide, not just the restaurant and also hearing from the folks about how there was a time that Seattle downtown Seattle night life was a thing.",97,,
710,0.97,5987.815,5989.817,It was a place to go.,97,,
711,0.97,5989.817,5993.153,People don't go downtown any more.,97,,
712,0.97,5993.153,6000.461,"I know some of you, again, when we have these conversations, people are quick to say Oh, it is just business.",97,,
713,0.97,6000.461,6002.363,And you are Criminalizing the unsheltered and you don't care.,97,,
714,0.97,6002.363,6010.104,"But what I have heard from all of you and also the people have called in, is that we can do both.",97,,
715,0.97,6010.104,6019.947,"We literally can attack the root causes of these issues, and we can uplift, support and empower or businesses.",97,,
716,0.97,6019.947,6020.314,Big and small.,97,,
717,0.97,6020.314,6036.697,"So I'm glad that we are having an honest, candid conversation without Impugning the integrity of our other colleagues, without name calling, without bringing up the past about who voted for what, when.",97,,
718,0.97,6036.697,6042.703,There was a comment made a few days ago about when we passed the jump start tax.,97,,
719,0.97,6042.703,6045.773,And I was one of the people that voted no.,97,,
720,0.97,6045.773,6057.384,"Now, I didn't want to go into all the detail yesterday, but one of the reasons I voted no, not because I was against the tax itself, but I wanted it to go to the voters.",97,,
721,0.97,6057.384,6069.463,"So I'm hoping that, and thank you Council member chair that you are providing a space, a safe space for people to say this is why I did what I did, this is why I voted the way I voted.",97,,
722,0.97,6069.463,6071.832,"And also, businesses, we hear you.",97,,
723,0.97,6071.832,6072.199,We hear you.,97,,
724,0.97,6072.199,6076.603,And we have particular tools if you will in our Toolbox.,97,,
725,0.97,6076.603,6096.19,"And a lot of you, of what you shared that, what we can do to keep downtown safe and other neighborhoods like Lake City way, like negotiate gate, like Aurora.",97,,
726,0.97,6096.19,6106.633,"It is really Council member Nelson that has taken the lead, that that has to be one of the top three issues our city has to be honest about.",97,,
727,0.97,6106.633,6110.104,I know don has been in the trenches for a long time.,97,,
728,0.97,6110.104,6118.278,"It is good to hear from you again, Lisa from appliance for opinion near square.",97,,
729,0.97,6118.278,6131.058,"Working with the poor, friend of the waterfront, working with Northgate folks, you know, the bottom line is this.",97,,
730,0.97,6131.058,6136.597,"We need businesses and businesses need people to, they need their staff and the business to feel safe.",97,,
731,0.97,6136.597,6149.977,"Because those are the people that provide the jobs and if we don't have that, and if we get into this mode of, I don't even know a good way to say it.",97,,
732,0.97,6149.977,6165.659,"But I guess with I have seen is if we get in this mode of being retaliatory and punitive to people who just want to talk about what they see on the street, I was downtown Saturday night, not very late.",97,,
733,0.97,6165.659,6173.0,"And I'll be honest with you, I don't go to the market any more unless it is Saturday in broad daylight.",97,,
734,0.97,6173.0,6177.237,"And again, I'm not saying that to say there are only bad people down there.",97,,
735,0.97,6177.237,6179.473,I'm saying it has become a real safety issue.,97,,
736,0.97,6179.473,6184.378,And I don't think the downtown core can say it any louder.,97,,
737,0.97,6184.378,6192.653,And I think being a proponent of the Chamber of business doesn't make you Antilabor.,97,,
738,0.97,6192.653,6194.421,"I said yesterday, I'm sure everybody heard.",97,,
739,0.97,6194.421,6198.725,We are a labor down but we are also a business town.,97,,
740,0.97,6198.725,6209.736,There is a reason why we have Amazon and Microsoft and Starbucks and all these innovative businesses here.,97,,
741,0.97,6209.736,6217.744,"I think if we can all just bog talk about it, move forward, how do we do that?",97,,
742,0.97,6217.744,6227.387,How do we increase police presence to stop crime before it happens in how do we increase businesses to meet people where they are at with addiction and mental health?,97,,
743,0.97,6227.387,6234.828,"I tell you, going to work it breaks my heart to see all those tents along third and along fifth.",97,,
744,0.97,6234.828,6238.265,I'm not going to pretend they are not there.,97,,
745,0.97,6238.265,6239.666,"We see them, every day.",97,,
746,0.97,6239.666,6252.246,So I'm glad that Madam chair that you are providing a space for us to talk honestly and openly and candidly and that we can actually have civil discourse and we can agree to disagree.,97,,
747,0.97,6252.246,6256.617,"But I appreciate the people that called in, and I appreciate the panel that you put together.",97,,
748,0.97,6256.617,6264.658,"Because I think in the six years I have been on Council, I have never had an opportunity to hear from all the businesses.",97,,
749,0.97,6264.658,6266.66,And so thank you.,97,,
750,0.97,6266.66,6271.231,"And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why Council President Juarez is our President.",98,,
751,0.97,6271.231,6276.87,Thank you very much for those comments.,98,,
752,0.97,6276.87,6280.34,And I see that Dan Austin has his hand up.,98,,
753,0.97,6280.34,6280.707,Thank you.,99,,
754,0.97,6280.707,6292.919,"I just wanted to mention and this is something, I like the idea of the community Hub coordinator and some sort of Street time team to be able to be in the area as a foot patrol.",99,,
755,0.97,6292.919,6298.692,I would leak to point out I'm not sure which Council member it would have been in the past.,99,,
756,0.97,6298.692,6309.67,"But about five, six years ago, our business license went up by roughly 400-Dollar to $500 with a promise of 200 additional police officers.",99,,
757,0.97,6309.67,6311.038,And we have paid it every year.,99,,
758,0.97,6311.038,6313.674,We have had continuously less and less police officers.,99,,
759,0.97,6313.674,6318.645,That was a specific tax put on the businesses to support 200 officers for safety.,99,,
760,0.97,6318.645,6328.922,"With this foot patrol idea, this business district, walking patrol, the businesses are already paying dedicated money to public safety.",99,,
761,0.97,6328.922,6332.659,But it is not going to police officers because we don't have them.,99,,

763,0.97,6341.368,6350.31,I think it is a really good dedicated source of funding to put into these programs.,99,,
764,0.97,6350.31,6351.244,And that money is there.,99,,
765,0.97,6351.244,6353.547,It was dedicated to at that time police.,99,,
766,0.97,6353.547,6356.249,Let's call it public safety now.,99,,
767,0.97,6356.249,6357.084,A specific increase to businesses.,99,,

769,0.97,6359.953,6361.421,I just want to point that out.,99,,
770,0.97,6361.421,6364.491,"That fund is there, we have been paying for it.",99,,
771,0.97,6364.491,6366.426,We have been seen the benefit from it.,99,,
772,0.97,6366.426,6371.565,Maybe we can find out how much money that exactly and move that over into these new ideas.,99,,
773,0.97,6371.565,6373.633,But the funding is there.,99,,
774,0.97,6373.633,6376.636,We don't need a new tax for it.,99,,
775,0.97,6376.636,6376.937,It exists.,99,,
776,0.97,6376.937,6380.674,"Well, thank you for that insight.",100,,
777,0.97,6380.674,6387.147,I remember that the Seattle Chamber did support that.,100,,
778,0.97,6387.147,6389.583,Businesses taxing themselves for additional officers in 2018.,100,,
779,0.97,6389.583,6390.016,That's correct.,100,,
780,0.97,6390.016,6392.119,And I hadn't remembered that.,100,,
781,0.97,6392.119,6395.522,So I will follow-up on that one.,100,,
782,0.97,6395.522,6413.407,"I wanted to mention that you know, you'll have, the business owners here have businesses to run and the directors, your the portfolio of the work that you are mandated to do, is fairly narrow.",100,,

785,0.97,6444.671,6448.608,This wasn't in your job description.,100,,
786,0.97,6448.608,6451.244,And I believe the city can do more.,100,,
787,0.97,6451.244,6455.115,And starting with forwarding and advance and go promoting some of these ideas.,100,,
788,0.97,6455.115,6457.484,Who else has a question?,100,,
789,0.97,6457.484,6458.585,I see that Oscar does.,100,,
790,0.97,6458.585,6458.885,Thank you.,100,,

799,0.97,6503.697,6505.298,I couldn't tell you.,103,,
800,0.97,6505.298,6512.939,We have them installed on the interior of our businesses.,103,,
801,0.97,6512.939,6515.075,And we have other mitigating infrastructure.,103,,
802,0.97,6515.075,6519.412,But I couldn't tell you if they are difficult to permit or not.,103,,
803,0.97,6519.412,6519.713,Got it.,104,,
804,0.97,6519.713,6524.618,I seem to remember a Snafu when we tried to do it.,104,,
805,0.97,6524.618,6525.452,Thank you for that.,104,,

808,0.97,6531.892,6534.661,Did anyone else see?,105,,
809,0.97,6534.661,6536.863,I did have my hand up.,106,,
810,0.97,6536.863,6537.13,Okay.,107,,
811,0.97,6537.13,6545.538,"I was just going to say just following up with what was just said, rolling gates would definitely be great.",108,,

813,0.97,6551.344,6559.219,We can't have anything on our doors or in front.,108,,
814,0.97,6559.219,6566.326,Because that actually is something that it makes it where it is lessen sighting and so it presents a bad Emmanuel.,108,,
815,0.97,6566.326,6569.963,So that is why in all Columbus city we can't have that.,108,,
816,0.97,6569.963,6574.0,With can't even have neon lights.,108,,
817,0.97,6574.0,6584.377,"So the other issue that, it took us like almost three months to remove the bench right in front of our business.",108,,
818,0.97,6584.377,6589.482,Because that is where people were standing and harassing people.,108,,
819,0.97,6589.482,6595.188,I do think the time for fix it is a great idea.,108,,
820,0.97,6595.188,6605.165,"Because that in coordination with the sliding doors, with the door fix it, presented would be a good combination of the two.",108,,
821,0.97,6605.165,6621.081,"So we have the fund and fix it and then coordinate with the fund for the door replacement, where maybe even the city just takes over that whole replacement for smaller businesses.",108,,
822,0.97,6621.081,6621.448,Great idea.,109,,
823,0.97,6621.448,6621.748,Thank you.,109,,

826,0.97,6634.661,6642.569,"But if there is something urgent like this, I think they would be more lenient on it.",111,,
827,0.97,6642.569,6644.537,But that would need city support.,111,,
828,0.97,6644.537,6654.948,"The other thing I wanted to talk about is, in addition to the city coordination, I'm also urging better coordination across I think County.",112,,
829,0.97,6654.948,6664.991,"That is a big one for us, mainly because some of our issues are even like state and Federal.",112,,

832,0.97,6679.806,6682.509,Breakdown and now it is back with a vengeance.,112,,
833,0.97,6682.509,6686.88,King County is not really played a role in any of that.,112,,
834,0.97,6686.88,6688.281,The state hasn't played a role.,112,,
835,0.97,6688.281,6693.486,We don't know where and how to deal with it.,112,,
836,0.97,6693.486,6703.663,Just better coordination or at least better more effort put into working with King County and our state legislation around some of those larger crimes.,112,,
837,0.97,6703.663,6704.23,Okay.,113,,
838,0.97,6704.23,6705.532,Thank you very much.,113,,
839,0.97,6705.532,6711.971,And I don't know what Council President Juarez knows about Intergovernment relations on that.,113,,
840,0.97,6711.971,6718.211,"But we could, that is a good thing to follow-up on.",113,,
841,0.97,6718.211,6721.014,"Terikka, you have your hand up in.",114,,
842,0.97,6721.014,6731.024,"Ia, I just wanted to add to the historical component as well and just the limitations with running a business.",115,,
843,0.97,6731.024,6737.797,And building that is over 120 years old.,115,,

846,0.97,6773.099,6788.882,"I had to just get creative with just other ways of trying to distract and you know, just try not to make it look too enticing for folks to do whatever they are going to do.",115,,
847,0.97,6788.882,6789.149,So Yeah.,115,,
848,0.97,6789.149,6799.058,I just wanted to add if there is any kind of provisions that could be made for businesses being held in historic districts.,115,,
849,0.97,6799.058,6801.461,That Yeah I don't know what to add.,116,,
850,0.97,6801.461,6805.865,I just want to throw that out there.,116,,
851,0.97,6805.865,6808.168,That is an issue.,116,,
852,0.97,6808.168,6808.468,Got it.,117,,
853,0.97,6808.468,6812.405,I notice Council member Strauss was writing notes on that.,117,,
854,0.97,6812.405,6817.911,I think that your point on historic districts lucky you.,117,,
855,0.97,6817.911,6820.446,But Maybe there is something we can expedite.,117,,
856,0.97,6820.446,6820.747,Oscar?,118,,
857,0.97,6820.747,6821.147,Please go ahead.,118,,
858,0.97,6821.147,6822.749,I had something else.,119,,
859,0.97,6822.749,6824.717,We have been talking about prevention measures.,119,,
860,0.97,6824.717,6834.127,And I would like to hear what anybody has to say about violent crime with firearms and what we can do to address that.,119,,
861,0.97,6834.127,6839.065,"It is not an easy topic to talk about, I want to acknowledge that.",119,,
862,0.97,6839.065,6848.575,"And it is, it is a real and present danger in our community.",119,,
863,0.97,6848.575,6850.643,Not to put people on the spot.,119,,
864,0.97,6850.643,6857.684,But this is something that is true and real and that we are having to face.,119,,
865,0.97,6857.684,6860.22,"I just don't, I don't have answers.",119,,
866,0.97,6860.22,6869.963,I don't expect anybody to have some kind of a panacea to address this.,119,,
867,0.97,6869.963,6883.776,"But any ideas from, from folks from Council or any other of the associations from the businesses that are facing these crimes at the moment?",119,,
868,0.97,6883.776,6884.978,It is quite troubling.,119,,
869,0.97,6884.978,6888.214,Council President Juarez did you take off your Mic?,120,,
870,0.97,6888.214,6890.183,I did.,121,,
871,0.97,6890.183,6894.988,"Oscar, I know that was probably a little bit, I can't find you on my panel.",121,,
872,0.97,6894.988,6895.855,There you are.,121,,
873,0.97,6895.855,6902.462,"You know, this is the one thing about being on Seattle city council.",121,,
874,0.97,6902.462,6906.532,I know Council member Nelson understands this as well.,121,,
875,0.97,6906.532,6912.939,Formerly working for Council member con Lynn when she was a chief of staff for him.,121,,

879,0.97,6930.723,6931.057,It is not.,121,,
880,0.97,6931.057,6938.431,"That is always going to be a human condition with addiction, mental health, poverty, those things are never going to go away.",121,,
881,0.97,6938.431,6956.649,"What we can do we are looking at with the help of Mayor is how we staff our police Department, but also redirect funds to programs to get away from so people don't find themselves in the pipeline in the system.",121,,
882,0.97,6956.649,6958.584,But that is going to take time.,121,,
883,0.97,6958.584,6970.43,"I think people thought when some people thought that when we redirected funds from the Seattle police Department to these what they call upstream programs, just overnight, it was going to happen.",121,,
884,0.97,6970.43,6970.863,It is not.,121,,

887,0.97,6982.942,6983.309,And we should.,121,,
888,0.97,6983.309,6992.952,"The way our systems work in the past for policing, were archaic, and racist, quite frankly, and basis from the Jim Crowe era.",121,,
889,0.97,6992.952,6997.557,"I know I'm getting a little deep here to get back to your question, Oscar.",121,,
890,0.97,6997.557,7002.462,I guess I'm going to ask you be a little bit patient with us.,121,,
891,0.97,7002.462,7005.531,The Mayor has been the Mayor for six weeks.,121,,
892,0.97,7005.531,7008.534,Council member Nelson has only been here for six weeks.,121,,
893,0.97,7008.534,7013.072,We are all trying to get under the new leadership working with the executive.,121,,
894,0.97,7013.072,7015.575,I think we can promise you that.,121,,
895,0.97,7015.575,7022.782,"That at least for MIA as Council President, I meet with the Mayor once a week, I that you can to chief of police once a week.",121,,
896,0.97,7022.782,7027.62,I get reports from chief Diaz once a week.,121,,
897,0.97,7027.62,7028.955,We work with Hsd.,121,,
898,0.97,7028.955,7038.498,"We work with Council member public safety, and of course we have Council member Lewis on the regional housing authority.",121,,

900,0.97,7045.071,7045.471,You are right.,121,,
901,0.97,7045.471,7047.473,There is no answer today.,121,,
902,0.97,7047.473,7055.381,"I don't think, unless someone here has something that I don't know, that is going to change overnight or even the next 30 days how we stop?",121,,
903,0.97,7055.381,7056.816,Of the most violent crime.,121,,
904,0.97,7056.816,7069.395,I think some of you saw which I could only watch a couple of times the poor woman where the man just picked up a bat and hit her in the head.,121,,
905,0.97,7069.395,7073.866,"That, I don't know how we got here for those of us who were born and raised here.",121,,
906,0.97,7073.866,7076.736,But that is where we are.,121,,
907,0.97,7076.736,7089.549,"And so, I think having these discussions and having Madam chair Nelson keep having these discussions about business and the violence that goes on, what I also hear from the black community is that they want community policing.",121,,
908,0.97,7089.549,7091.617,They want their small businesses to be safe.,121,,
909,0.97,7091.617,7095.021,They want their children to be protected.,121,,
910,0.97,7095.021,7099.492,They don't have the privilege of not having 911 show up.,121,,
911,0.97,7099.492,7101.427,And I know these conversations are difficult.,121,,
912,0.97,7101.427,7109.168,"And people are afraid to come out and really say how they feel, because they are afraid they are going to be called a racist or that they are going to be Demonized.",121,,
913,0.97,7109.168,7130.556,"But in order for us to get our arms around the issue, of crime, poverty, the root causes, public safety, community policing, we have to be honest about what is out there.",121,,
914,0.97,7130.556,7150.309,"So we are hoping with the Mayor and the chief Diaz and the city Council, and our new city attorney, Miss Ann Davidson, we can start looking at taking out the bad actors hurting our cities and businesses and people and relatives and hopefully get back on track.",121,,
915,0.97,7150.309,7157.049,"I don't have an answer for you, Oscar on what is going to stop people getting a gun and coming into your store.",121,,
916,0.97,7157.049,7164.157,"And to be Frank with you, I don't believe hiring way more police or addressing every issue with a gun and a badge works, either.",121,,
917,0.97,7164.157,7165.691,We know who gets affected the worst.,121,,
918,0.97,7165.691,7166.425,It is people of color.,121,,
919,0.97,7166.425,7166.993,They get killed.,121,,
920,0.97,7166.993,7172.265,We just saw that on the news with the No-Knock warrants.,121,,
921,0.97,7172.265,7174.367,But I want to keep having these conversations with you.,121,,
922,0.97,7174.367,7180.94,"I have seen all your names, I have seen your faces in different places.",121,,
923,0.97,7180.94,7195.154,And I'm honored that Council member Nelson is getting this all together and I hope this becomes a regular thing that we hear your voices.,121,,
924,0.97,7195.154,7198.624,I know that doesn't quite answer your question but I want you to know I hear you.,121,,
925,0.97,7198.624,7198.991,Thank you.,122,,
926,0.97,7198.991,7208.367,Pointing out with all the meetings you have the unique vulnerability our retail businesses are in.,122,,
927,0.97,7208.367,7209.035,Especially with gun violence.,122,,
