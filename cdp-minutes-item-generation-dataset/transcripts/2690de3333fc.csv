66,0.97,309.642,310.977,"Thanks, Quinn.",25,,
67,0.97,310.977,313.246,I will start with housing and homelessness.,25,,
68,0.97,313.246,325.558,"Many of you all over this year and last year have been following the progress of Hb1099, which would add a climate response to the state's comprehensive format.",25,,
69,0.97,325.558,331.23,"That was amended in weighs and means, removing some of the actual climate elements from the bill.",25,,
70,0.97,331.23,333.299,It did pass out of the Senate.,25,,
71,0.97,333.299,346.479,We will be following further negotiations between the house and the Senate on what the final billing will include on that bill.,25,,
72,0.97,346.479,352.351,"Next, I briefed you all on representative's excessive dwelling bill.",25,,
73,0.97,352.351,354.12,This was a follow-up to the governor's conversation.,25,,
74,0.97,354.12,359.092,This bill was sort of one of the bills that made it forward out of the house.,25,,
75,0.97,359.092,362.628,"Unfortunately, it didn't get a vote in the Senate this year.",25,,
76,0.97,362.628,370.536,That bill will not be moving toward with this legislative session.,25,,
77,0.97,370.536,380.546,"Next, we have legislation around streamlining city authority for citing of temporary shelters or transitional Encampments.",25,,
78,0.97,380.546,389.489,"Although the bill was pulled for rules in the house, unfortunately, it did not receive a vote by the cutoff on Friday.",25,,
79,0.97,389.489,392.558,We do anticipate that legislation will not be moving forward this session.,25,,
80,0.97,392.558,408.474,"And finally, some of you were following the governor's proposal on right of way camping, setting up a governmental structure to coordinate between the city and the state on helping folks who are camped in state right of ways.",25,,
81,0.97,408.474,413.413,That bill did not move out of House appropriations.,25,,
82,0.97,413.413,421.254,We do anticipate funding in the budget to both cleanup and helping folks get shelter related to right of way.,25,,
83,0.97,421.254,428.995,We will provide more details on what the budget language includes when we provide the final you date to you all.,25,,
84,0.97,428.995,434.967,A real highlight this year for the Legislature was work on gun responsibility.,25,,
85,0.97,434.967,444.31,I think many of you for many years have been following the state's efforts to ban the sale of High-Capacity magazines.,25,,
86,0.97,444.31,455.788,"On Friday, after many hours of debate, the House of Representatives voted on Sb-5078, which bans the sale of High-Capacity magazines.",25,,
87,0.97,455.788,460.259,"It's a huge achievement for a lot of people over many, many years of effort.",25,,
88,0.97,460.259,466.299,There was no amendments in the house and that will head to the governor's desk to be signed into law.,25,,
89,0.97,466.299,474.774,Thank you to all of you who very involved in that process for many years.,25,,
90,0.97,474.774,475.908,Thank you to Councilmember Herbold.,25,,
91,0.97,475.908,478.878,A huge achievement and a win for gun responsibility at the state.,25,,
92,0.97,478.878,484.817,Not the only one in gun responsibility.,25,,
93,0.97,484.817,491.09,Representative Berry's bill concerning Untraceable ghost guns was passed out of the Senate without amendments and has been forwarded on to the governor's office.,25,,
94,0.97,491.09,509.442,"And another bill by representative establishing restrictions on possession of weapons at certain public locations, including election sites and city halls was also passed out of the Senate.",25,,
95,0.97,509.442,513.312,There were some small amendments on that legislation.,25,,
96,0.97,513.312,517.316,We do anticipate there will be--that bill will be moving toward through the process.,25,,
97,0.97,517.316,521.22,But it will need to go back to the house.,25,,
98,0.97,521.22,526.559,So that was some of the highlights on gun responsibility this year.,25,,
99,0.97,526.559,529.729,Some real big wins that have been many years in the making.,25,,
100,0.97,529.729,532.965,Thank you all for your help on those.,25,,
101,0.97,532.965,543.976,"One of the other pieces of public safety we have been following is follow-up to the use of force legislation from last year, Hb-1310.",25,,
102,0.97,543.976,559.492,"There have been a number of bills in this policy area this year, two that I think I have mentioned before regarding less lethal methods and behavioral health interventions.",25,,
103,0.97,559.492,565.197,"Both of the bills, 1719 and 1735, have been signed into law by the governor.",25,,
104,0.97,565.197,574.573,We also saw action last week on Hb2037 and Sb5919.,25,,
105,0.97,574.573,585.418,Hb2037 ADOPTS the use of force definition and a change to the stock law in the state.,25,,
106,0.97,585.418,588.487,That bill was passed out of the Senate without amendments.,25,,
107,0.97,588.487,593.292,"They were the amendments documented in the house, but not adopted on the Senate floor.",25,,
108,0.97,593.292,602.001,So that bill will be headed to the governor's office for action.,25,,
109,0.97,602.001,605.838,5919 was a Senate alternative to the 2037 legislation.,25,,
110,0.97,605.838,614.313,It was significantly amended in the House public safety committee to exclusively address vehicular pursuits.,25,,
111,0.97,614.313,617.35,That bill passed out of the House late last week.,25,,
112,0.97,617.35,622.722,We will need to be reconsidered by the Senate because of the amendments.,25,,
113,0.97,622.722,627.293,And we will await final determinations of language on that legislation this final week of session.,25,,
114,0.97,627.293,633.432,So those are some of the sort of policing and public safety legislation that we have been following this year.,25,,
115,0.97,633.432,638.671,And I will pass it back over the Quinn.,25,,
116,0.97,638.804,639.271,"Thanks, Elsa.",26,,
117,0.97,639.271,642.942,A few updates in the transportation space.,26,,
118,0.97,642.942,658.691,"First off, some bills that are not moving forward this year, Senate bill 5354, which deals with the ability to use Nonuniformed Flaggers at certainly intersections.",26,,
119,0.97,658.691,662.528,"Unfortunately, that bill did not make it out of the House transportation committee.",26,,
120,0.97,662.528,666.232,That will not be moving forward this year.,26,,
121,0.97,666.232,685.384,"Two other bills, which have not advanced, although we are hopeful for their inclusion in the transportation re knew package, Senator bill 5707 extends the city's automatic authority for blocking the transit lanes for two additional years.",26,,
122,0.97,685.384,695.895,That was included in the move ahead Washington transportation revenue package from the start.,26,,
123,0.97,695.895,696.595,That was a redundancy.,26,,
124,0.97,696.595,698.864,It's not surprising to not see it move forward.,26,,
125,0.97,698.864,705.271,We anticipate with the passage of move ahead Washington that that policy would be enacted.,26,,
126,0.97,705.271,722.121,"The other bill, Senate bill 5510, which clarifies renewal processes for transportation benefit districts, primarily the ability to renew more than once.",26,,
127,0.97,722.121,724.09,This is an issue for the city of Seattle.,26,,
128,0.97,724.09,728.16,We are on the second go of the benefit district.,26,,
129,0.97,728.16,730.763,"When that expires, we will need the clarity.",26,,
130,0.97,730.763,732.531,That bill did not move forward.,26,,
131,0.97,732.531,741.04,"And it is included in the transportation revenue package, but there are conversations with Awc and other Stakeholders about trying to get that shifted in there.",26,,
132,0.97,741.04,745.578,"So hopefully, we can see that here in the final days.",26,,
133,0.97,745.578,765.898,"And then one bill to highlight that has continued to advance and is actually now headed to the governor's desk after passage in the House last week, and the Senate Concurring today, a bill that many of you have been following.",26,,
134,0.97,765.898,766.599,The rat supplemental revenue.,26,,
135,0.97,766.599,773.939,This will provide the city of Seattle with additional revenue options to provide funding for light rail.,26,,
136,0.97,773.939,782.481,That bill is now headed to governor's desk.,26,,
137,0.97,782.481,788.32,Thank you Councilmember Strauss for Testifying on behalf of the city.,26,,
138,0.97,788.32,789.155,That is headed to the governor's desk.,26,,
139,0.97,789.155,793.459,I think that concludes our presentation.,26,,
140,0.97,793.459,794.827,We are happy to take any questions.,26,,
141,0.97,794.96,805.571,If there are any questions for the team?,27,,
142,0.97,805.571,806.472,Councilmember Strauss?,27,,
143,0.97,806.472,807.106,"Thank you, Council President.",28,,
144,0.97,807.106,827.86,"And Quinn, director Tarleton, and Elsa, if you want to follow up with me, since I have you, recognizing that signing guy is coming this week, and we have two Seattle legislators, this will be last.",28,,
145,0.97,827.86,834.833,I want to see if there are activities or anything to do to celebrate their service to our city.,28,,
146,0.97,834.967,838.904,"Councilmember Strauss, thank you very much for noting that.",29,,
147,0.97,838.904,848.614,Those two legislators from Seattle have done so much heavy lifting over their years of service.,29,,
148,0.97,848.614,856.222,And I would probably have a hunch that their colleagues are trying to figure out what will be happening.,29,,
149,0.97,856.222,863.963,"But those two senators are also deeply, deeply engaged in the final stretch.",29,,
150,0.97,863.963,870.836,"So we'll check in, and we will find out if there is a way that we can celebrate their contributions to our city and state.",29,,
151,0.97,871.17,877.276,.,29,,
152,0.97,877.276,877.61,Thank you.,30,,
153,0.97,877.61,878.077,Councilmember Herbold?,30,,
154,0.97,878.21,878.611,Thanks so much.,31,,
155,0.97,878.611,885.517,I want to thank the ORI team for all the support they gave me so I could be a more effective advocate this session.,31,,
156,0.97,885.517,894.26,Really appreciated having the opportunity to contribute in some small way on the three gun bills.,31,,
157,0.97,894.26,898.197,And couldn't have done so without your help.,31,,
158,0.97,898.197,904.97,That last Email blast out that you helped me send was a fun one with the Video of my testimony included.,31,,
159,0.97,904.97,913.312,And I got a lot of really positive feedback from ledge lay Tors who received it.,31,,
160,0.97,913.312,923.389,It's a good reminder to do those one on one conversations with legislators as well and to thank them afterwards.,31,,
161,0.97,923.389,927.026,"So really, I'm thanking you for reminding me to thank them.",31,,
162,0.97,927.026,930.863,And I had a cup of questions about a couple of bills.,31,,
163,0.97,930.863,941.34,"Regarding uses of force, I know that there were two amendments.",31,,
164,0.97,941.34,954.253,"And I heard you say that it passed out of the Senate without amendment, but I can't remember whether or not these amendments may have gotten in when they were heard over in the house.",31,,
165,0.97,954.253,961.927,"The ACLU was seeking two very, I think, small Tweaks to the bill.",31,,
166,0.97,961.927,967.599,One was just clarify that the Terry stop situation is when somebody is intentionally fleeing.,31,,
167,0.97,967.599,969.401,And clarifying that it was for a criminal offense.,31,,
168,0.97,969.401,977.309,So just wanting to clarify on that.,31,,
169,0.97,977.309,988.12,Especially given Seattle's special situation of being under a consent decree because of intentional use of force.,31,,
170,0.97,988.12,998.097,"And precipitating event being the shooting of Williams, who was--did not know he was being detained due to his hearing disability.",31,,
171,0.97,998.097,1002.701,There's an example of a situation we don't want force used.,31,,
172,0.97,1002.701,1008.841,A person may not be intentionally fleeing.,31,,
173,0.97,1008.841,1013.045,So just wanted to get some clarity on that.,31,,
174,0.97,1013.045,1018.917,"And then one other question is related to Lfo, the legal financial obligations bill 1412.",31,,
175,0.97,1018.917,1021.987,I see it was passed out of the Senate.,31,,
176,0.97,1021.987,1026.592,I'm trying to understand whether or not it needs to go back to the house for a final vote.,31,,
177,0.97,1026.592,1026.825,Thanks.,31,,
178,0.97,1026.959,1030.729,"Thanks, Councilmember, for the question.",32,,
179,0.97,1030.729,1037.97,"That amendment on the first, on 2037, the amounts were adopted in the Senate law and justice committee.",32,,
180,0.97,1037.97,1041.206,And those amendments were not adopted on the floor.,32,,
181,0.97,1041.206,1044.243,So the final bill does not include those changes.,32,,
182,0.97,1044.243,1046.645,So that's the answer to that question.,32,,
183,0.97,1046.645,1054.586,"On 1412, the bill did pass out of the Senate.",32,,
184,0.97,1054.586,1056.588,"It had amendments in the Senate, I believe.",32,,
185,0.97,1056.588,1062.961,So I think it will need to go back to the house for concurrence.,32,,
186,0.97,1063.295,1069.034,.,32,,
187,0.97,1069.034,1070.169,Let's see.,33,,
188,0.97,1070.169,1070.702,Do I see any other hands?,33,,
189,0.97,1070.702,1089.121,"So just briefly, first of all, thank you, director Tarleton and team for meeting with me before we meet with all of our colleagues to go through particular bills on the transportation stuff.",33,,
190,0.97,1089.121,1094.827,The move ahead Washington and some of that I was particularly tracking for sound transit.,33,,
191,0.97,1094.827,1101.533,And I will probably share a little bit more of that when it's my turn to talk about what I have done in the last week.,33,,
192,0.97,1101.533,1103.435,I want to thank you guys.,33,,
193,0.97,1103.435,1120.118,"You have been great about getting everything we needed, following up with additional information, particularly on the--some of the use of force issues, the transportation issues, the housing issues, the missing middle legislation.",33,,
194,0.97,1120.118,1120.652,Some of the Sepa stuff.,33,,
195,0.97,1120.652,1124.389,I don't think people know behind the scenes what Y'all provide for us.,33,,
196,0.97,1124.389,1126.492,I want to thank you for that.,33,,
197,0.97,1126.492,1134.366,"If there are--is there anything you want to wrap up with, Gael?",33,,
198,0.97,1134.366,1145.611,"Council President, I wanted to reiterate how valuable it has been to have you all be able to weigh in on very short notice with no turn around time.",34,,
199,0.97,1145.611,1150.249,And it makes a big difference as Councilmember Herbold said.,34,,
200,0.97,1150.249,1158.724,We will be hoping that there can be a brief summary of the results after Sonny die.,34,,
201,0.97,1158.724,1166.765,But that we will not be providing a detailed legislative report to all of you until after the governor has actually signed the bills.,34,,
202,0.97,1166.765,1178.977,We all know different circumstances where things can happen between the transfer to the governor's mansion and the signature on a piece of legislation.,34,,
203,0.97,1178.977,1188.854,So we'll be waiting probably until sometime later in the month to--perhaps early April before you have a full wrap.,34,,
204,0.97,1188.854,1195.127,"And we look forward to an opportunity to brief you at that time, Madame President, at your convenience.",34,,
205,0.97,1195.26,1208.674,"So just so we're clear, though, on the Untraceable guns, that was signed by the governor, the Senate bill 1705?",35,,
206,0.97,1208.674,1209.007,Yes.,36,,
207,0.97,1209.007,1209.741,Correct.,36,,
208,0.97,1209.741,1210.108,And then--.,37,,
209,0.97,1210.108,1212.611,It's been signed by the President of the Senate.,38,,
210,0.97,1212.611,1215.113,I think it's being transferred to the governor's office now.,38,,
211,0.97,1215.113,1219.184,Unless it happened this morning and I missed it.,38,,
212,0.97,1219.184,1219.451,Okay.,39,,
213,0.97,1219.451,1226.625,And the other one that we know was the peace officer use of force 1735 is already signed?,39,,
214,0.97,1226.758,1231.863,That's correct.,40,,
215,0.97,1231.863,1233.398,The governor signed 1735 and 1719 late last week.,40,,
216,0.97,1233.398,1233.532,.,40,,
217,0.97,1233.532,1234.666,Last week.,41,,
218,0.97,1234.666,1234.9,Okay.,42,,
219,0.97,1234.9,1236.635,That's what my notes say.,42,,
220,0.97,1236.635,1236.935,"Okay, great.",42,,
221,0.97,1236.935,1238.136,All right.,42,,
222,0.97,1238.136,1243.041,I do not see any more questions or concerns from my colleagues.,42,,
223,0.97,1243.041,1246.511,"I'm guessing if they have something else, they will get Ahold of you off line.",42,,
224,0.97,1246.511,1246.845,Thank you.,43,,
225,0.97,1246.979,1252.384,"With that, colleagues, moving on to the agenda.",44,,
226,0.97,1252.384,1259.791,We are going to go to signs of letters or proclamations.,44,,
227,0.97,1259.791,1262.16,Councilmember Morales has a proclamation for us.,44,,
228,0.97,1262.16,1268.133,I will let her introduce us and tell us about it before questions.,44,,
229,0.97,1268.133,1270.802,And we will have it on tomorrow's calendar.,44,,
230,0.97,1270.802,1275.941,"Today, we will be looking for people who want to affix their name.",44,,
231,0.97,1275.941,1279.845,Go ahead and walk it through the proclamation.,44,,
232,0.97,1279.845,1280.078,Sure.,45,,
233,0.97,1280.078,1280.545,"Thank you, everybody.",45,,
234,0.97,1280.545,1284.449,You should have received a copy of the proclamation last week.,45,,
235,0.97,1284.449,1296.428,"And I am asking for your support to make tomorrow, March 8th, Phyllis little day.",45,,
236,0.97,1296.428,1300.866,Phyllis was a lifelong advocate and HIV educator and leader for over 30 years.,45,,
237,0.97,1300.866,1312.644,"Especially during the time of our own pandemic right now, it's important to uplift leaders from our past.",45,,
238,0.97,1312.644,1318.617,"And frankly, more invisible or treated completely differently pandemic, the HIV and aids pandemic.",45,,
239,0.97,1318.617,1325.424,"Like the current crisis, the impact of HIV and aids on black and Brown communities disproportionate and devastating.",45,,
240,0.97,1325.424,1331.897,"The loss of many or our neighbors, family, and friends.",45,,
241,0.97,1331.897,1336.802,"Phyllis started Pocan, people of color against AIDS network, as a program manager in 1990.",45,,
242,0.97,1336.802,1340.939,And assumed the role of executive director in 1998.,45,,
243,0.97,1340.939,1358.39,"She worked closely with the Washington State Department of health, with Washington State Department of corrections, and started one of the first HIV medical case management programs focused on the Bipoc community that worked to reduce the effects of HIV in communities of color.",45,,
244,0.97,1358.39,1362.928,And did this work until her retirement in 2015.,45,,
245,0.97,1362.928,1372.604,Phyllis left us last November.,45,,
246,0.97,1372.604,1375.674,So the folks at P.O.C.A.,45,,
247,0.97,1375.674,1382.647,N. and her friends and family were asking for her recognized.,45,,
248,0.97,1382.647,1391.99,"Tomorrow, Phyllis' daughter will accept the proclamation of behalf of the family and speak to the amazing life of her mother.",45,,
249,0.97,1391.99,1399.464,"So, colleagues, I am asking today for you to indicate if you would like your name affixed to the proclamation.",45,,
250,0.97,1399.464,1407.139,Are there any comments or questions or anything anyone would like to add to Councilmember Morales' honoring Phyllis?,46,,
251,0.97,1407.139,1410.142,I just want to add a quick note.,46,,
252,0.97,1410.142,1420.719,And just probably going back in the time machine and show how old I am.,46,,
253,0.97,1420.719,1422.087,I remember Phyllis.,46,,
254,0.97,1422.087,1425.423,I was pregnant with my first daughter and she asked me to be on the board.,46,,
255,0.97,1425.423,1427.826,That daughter is now 30.,46,,
256,0.97,1427.826,1428.994,I remember her.,46,,
257,0.97,1428.994,1434.833,And she was well connected with the Washington state Commission with justice Smith and all those folks back in the day.,46,,
258,0.97,1434.833,1442.741,And with used to be ever green legal services and all of us back in the day.,46,,
259,0.97,1442.741,1446.645,So I'm really sorry to hear of her passing.,46,,
260,0.97,1446.645,1449.614,I am glad you brought this forward.,46,,
261,0.97,1449.614,1454.219,I had forgotten about who she was and what she had done.,46,,
262,0.97,1454.219,1467.532,"For all of the young ones listening, back then, nobody was stepping forward in communities of color and advocating for those folks for HIV and AIDS.",46,,
263,0.97,1467.532,1469.868,There wasn't anything really there.,46,,
264,0.97,1469.868,1484.816,"And that was toward--I would say not the height, but in the middle of the AIDS epidemic and what we were working with groups on Capitol Hill and representing people denied health care and housing due to HIV and AIDS.",46,,
265,0.97,1484.816,1488.487,And I remember her now.,46,,
266,0.97,1488.487,1493.191,"I want to thank you, Councilmember Morales, for bringing this forward.",46,,
267,0.97,1493.191,1494.893,Eople forget the history of how long these things take.,46,,
268,0.97,1494.893,1498.797,And the type of people like Phyllis that make it happen.,46,,
269,0.97,1498.797,1502.133,So I'm looking forward to meeting her family tomorrow.,46,,
270,0.97,1502.133,1505.437,"So again, I just want to thank you for that.",46,,
271,0.97,1505.57,1506.571,Thank you.,47,,
272,0.97,1506.571,1506.805,Yeah.,48,,

580,0.97,3220.984,3223.987,And rank and file want to get back to their lives.,88,,
581,0.97,3223.987,3229.492,But the question for them and for the working class as a whole is on whose terms?,88,,
582,0.97,3229.492,3232.028,On the conditions of a strong contract for the workers?,88,,
583,0.97,3232.028,3233.597,Or on the terms of the bosses?,88,,
584,0.97,3233.597,3241.404,I want to quote from an Email sent to all Councilmembers by a family member of a striking driver.,88,,

591,0.97,3277.173,3284.014,It is the greed of the companies and the refusal to bargain in good faith.,88,,

595,0.97,3328.692,3343.673,I appeal to all workers to refuse to cross the picket line and refuse to handle any concrete to break the strike.,88,,
596,0.97,3343.673,3352.349,The construction bosses are determined to break the sand and gravel strike and Unforce a sub standard contract to send a message.,88,,
597,0.97,3352.349,3354.551,Don't dare to fight for what you deserve.,88,,

605,0.97,3406.402,3424.42,And I urge all city departments with construction projects involving concrete to do everything in their power and use any leverage available in the construction project contracts to put pressure on the bosses to bargain in good faith.,88,,

609,0.97,3443.206,3451.748,It should be a reminder of how the previous victories were won in the first place.,88,,
610,0.97,3451.748,3463.66,Ledge late Tors voted to ban abortion after 15 weeks after pregnant in a state that was a Rev Fuj.,88,,

612,0.97,3475.038,3479.776,There are no exceptions for pregnancy that are the result of rape or incest.,88,,
613,0.97,3479.776,3492.388,And it has been called the most repressed restrictive law since the decision assured the right to abortion in 1973.,88,,
614,0.97,3492.388,3502.165,"This spring, the Supreme Court will decide on a case that could be a Deadlier blow to the rights in the U.S.",88,,
615,0.97,3502.165,3509.906,It would result in allowing bans on abortion just after 15 weeks.,88,,
616,0.97,3509.906,3521.551,"It would mean that Roe v. wade, the defining victory on the movement of the '60s and '70s could be null Foied by the time of the 50th anniversary in 2023.",88,,
617,0.97,3521.551,3524.587,This is unless there's a massive fight back to stop it.,88,,
618,0.97,3524.587,3528.258,Let's look at what's happening around the world.,88,,
619,0.97,3528.258,3538.968,Texas Senate bill 8 went in effect in September just as the struggle for abortion rights reached a milestone in Mexico.,88,,
620,0.97,3538.968,3541.271,Which it was declared unconstitutional.,88,,
621,0.97,3541.271,3547.01,This victory would not have been possible on relies on the political establishment.,88,,
622,0.97,3547.01,3552.081,It Tookiers of building organizations across borders and mass Mobilizations to apply pressure from below.,88,,

739,0.97,4316.278,4325.821,Many of you may have seen an article about Dallas where violent crime decreased in 2021 after the previous two years of increases in violent crime.,92,,
740,0.97,4325.821,4353.115,And they Kwoelt their police chief as saying the goal is a wide range in collaboration between city agencies to address complex specific issues like park access and homelessness and a concerted push to engage individuals at a high risk of being a victim of crime through initiatives like gun interpreter programs.,92,,
741,0.97,4353.115,4358.253,"Chief Garcia in Dallas said that the plan, like any plan, cannot all be about police.",92,,
742,0.97,4358.253,4394.289,And I think that is reflected in the description of operation new day and need to look at how we are creating transparency around those Nonlaw enforcement elements so that we can really tell the public that we have learned the lessons from other previous interventions that historically have moved the Dysfunctional and violent activity to another location.,92,,
743,0.97,4394.289,4397.726,And we discussed the ongoing Nick Jr. call analysis.,92,,

769,0.97,4544.907,4561.356,"In regards to sound transit, in Olympia, the leaders work to the final passage of the move ahead Washington proposal to provide new funding for transportation projects and funding across the state.",93,,
770,0.97,4561.356,4571.133,"Gael and her team touched on some of this with bill 5974, the transportation resource and Senate bill 5975, which is the additive transportation funding.",93,,

772,0.97,4575.203,4579.541,So sound transit three is the largest transportation project in our state's history.,93,,
773,0.97,4579.541,4590.519,"And as a member of the sound transit board, I want to highlight a few investment move ahead Washington would make.",93,,

787,0.97,4676.038,4679.908,And my understanding is it's returning to the Senate for fine tuning this week.,93,,
788,0.97,4679.908,4685.28,So I want to give a big shout out to Senator Pedersen.,93,,
789,0.97,4685.28,4690.852,"We started--I started conversation with him a year ago, last spring.",93,,
790,0.97,4690.852,4692.521,It's been wonderful working with him.,93,,

799,0.97,4772.934,4775.203,It started out around $51 million.,93,,
800,0.97,4775.203,4775.904,It's gone down.,93,,
801,0.97,4775.904,4778.507,I think it's around $20 million.,93,,
802,0.97,4778.507,4779.141,I'm not sure.,93,,
803,0.97,4779.141,4782.944,So you have someone there to provide services.,93,,
804,0.97,4782.944,4785.08,I know some people categorize it.,93,,
805,0.97,4785.08,4788.65,It wasn't millions of dollars to go on a sweep.,93,,

813,0.97,4833.128,4849.811,"My understanding is they are going to be rolling out, if it's not already out, and aisle find out by the end of the day, the programs for those folks if if they can't meet the obligations, that they will either be eliminated or reduced.",93,,
814,0.97,4849.811,4851.346,And there was a name for that.,93,,
815,0.97,4851.346,4854.015,And I just did not write it down.,93,,
816,0.97,4854.015,4855.984,And I feel bad.,93,,
817,0.97,4855.984,4857.018,I will get back to Y'all.,93,,
818,0.97,4857.018,4863.124,This is something we have been talking about for the last two years and working with the court about it.,93,,
819,0.97,4863.124,4866.828,You look like you might have the answer.,93,,
820,0.97,4866.962,4869.331,Legal financial obligations?,94,,
821,0.97,4869.331,4872.434,"No, no, not that one.",95,,

824,0.97,4876.671,4876.905,Okay.,97,,
825,0.97,4876.905,4880.909,"But they will have another program, like a Court-Like panel or whatever.",97,,
826,0.97,4880.909,4892.821,"You can come forward to a magistrate, that's the word I'm using, to say, Hey, I can't make the court fines.",97,,
827,0.97,4892.821,4893.622,Thises the need.,97,,
828,0.97,4893.622,4894.489,Nothing is revoked.,97,,
829,0.97,4894.489,4895.657,And it makes sense.,97,,
830,0.97,4895.657,4899.294,We have been doing that and they should have been doing it for years.,97,,
831,0.97,4899.294,4905.133,I should have more information next week about that after meeting with the Presiding judge Gregory.,97,,
832,0.97,4905.133,4910.672,"With that, I think that wraps up my comments.",97,,
833,0.97,4910.672,4917.912,Is there anything from my colleagues before we adjourn?,97,,
834,0.97,4917.912,4921.75,Do I see anything from the colleagues?,97,,
