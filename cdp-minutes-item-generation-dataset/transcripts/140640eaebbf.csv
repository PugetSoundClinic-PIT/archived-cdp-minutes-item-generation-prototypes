55,0.97,366.632,374.44,I wanted to speak to the third party delivery legislation that Councilmember Pedersen and Strauss are presenting today.,13,,
56,0.97,374.44,386.953,"As I think, many on the Council know, this was a critical lifeline for nearly every restaurant group across our great city through the bulk of the pandemic when restaurants were fully shut down.",13,,
57,0.97,386.953,394.861,"However, it was not just about the pandemic and the delivery owned window.",13,,
58,0.97,394.861,407.34,"There is a complete pricing power disparity when it comes to third party services, which Existeder before the pandemic, but the pandemic allowed us to see in very real terms.",13,,
59,0.97,407.34,416.516,The result of this new kind of business model with customers demanding delivery has been that restaurants have had to kind of change how they operate.,13,,
60,0.97,416.516,429.896,And the fact that they're only a handful a players in the delivery market means they can charge 30% or greater in many areas for a fundamental service that all should be able to access.,13,,
61,0.97,429.896,432.465,The second part of the equation is one of equity.,13,,
62,0.97,432.465,439.639,"I know this Council is completely committed to an equitable, and just economic recovery.",13,,
63,0.97,439.639,447.847,One of the things that the large third party delivery platforms are able to do is price differentiate based on the size of the business.,13,,
64,0.97,447.847,470.97,"Restaurant groups like mine enjoy a very very steep discount on those delivery services, whereas those small mom and pop restaurants are paying many times what a small restaurant ours would be paying for.",13,,
65,0.97,470.97,471.504,That's taking advantage.,13,,
66,0.97,471.504,479.979,"I encourage the consideration of Strauss and Pedersen's resolution, and I thank you for everyone's time today.",13,,
67,0.97,479.979,481.28,Thank you very much.,13,,

71,0.97,497.697,505.504,"Door dash knows private controls lead to higher costs for customers, fewer orders for local restaurants and fewer earning opportunities for our Dashers.",15,,
72,0.97,505.504,512.311,"That's why we're eager to work with the city Council to find a better solution, that won't hurt consumers and workers.",15,,
73,0.97,512.311,521.554,"While we recognize that the pandemic is not over, restaurants continue to reopen and restrictions on businesses have lifted.",15,,
74,0.97,521.554,530.196,Seattle restaurants options when it comes to serving their customers including through our new tiered pricing system.,15,,
75,0.97,530.196,546.279,"In April 2021, door dash Debuted new pricing plans that gives small and medium sized restaurants the ability to choose the level of service they want, which includes a 15% Commission rate, and the flexibility to change their plan whatever they want.",15,,
76,0.97,546.279,555.588,"Door dash does not support permanent price controls, and we know it is imperative to get the details of this legislation right as to not hurt the very restaurants you're trying to protect.",15,,
77,0.97,555.588,560.927,"We look forward to working with you, to find a solution that works for everyone.",15,,
78,0.97,560.927,562.061,Thank you.,15,,

128,0.97,840.439,849.381,"So it goes back to 30%, I won't be able to use them.",23,,
129,0.97,849.381,859.225,"I'm currently in debt, like many businesses are, over $150,000.",23,,

146,0.97,947.212,963.595,"There are over 4,000 active business licenses for restaurants and other businesses in the food industry, which was one of the hardest hit when the pandemic began, and many came to rely on delivery services to stay afloat.",26,,
147,0.97,963.595,975.908,"So I was not on the Council when the 15% cap was imposed, but it's now my job to support small business recovery.",26,,
148,0.97,975.908,994.093,"So I am hosting this item in this Committee, and I will turn it over to Councilmember Pedersen, and let's see, Karina bolt is on central staffing and will be presenting as well.",26,,

152,0.97,1005.637,1038.704,"I appreciate your hearing this bill today as a draft on the agenda, and making room to vote on the bill as your next committee meeting on July 27, because we are racing to beat the clock to get this adopted so that Seattle restaurants do not fall off a financial cliff to support Seattle's diverse restaurants and Cosponsoring this small business legislation with Councilmember Strauss to make permanent the 15% cap on fees, that third party delivery companies can charge.",27,,
153,0.97,1038.704,1048.28,"This legislation would add flexibility by enabling a restaurant to Opt-Out of the 15% cap, if it wants to receive additional services from the delivery companies.",27,,
154,0.97,1048.28,1065.431,"A sensible 15% cap on fees was originally adopted as part of the Mayor's civil emergency order in 2020, and has been helping many local restaurants survive the pandemic.",27,,
155,0.97,1065.431,1073.238,"Before the pandemic, out of town delivery services were charging as much as 15% on each food delivery order.",27,,
156,0.97,1073.238,1078.277,"Our diverse local restaurants face a financial cliff, unless we take immediate action.",27,,

165,0.97,1113.779,1115.481,"All right, can everyone see that?",29,,
166,0.97,1115.481,1139.304,"All right, so this morning, I'm going to provide some background on food delivery services in Seattle, and also provide a summary of proposed legislation that is cosponsored by Councilmember Pedersen and Councilmember Strauss that would permanently cap delivery service fees.",29,,
167,0.97,1139.304,1154.486,The policy objective of the legislation would be to require through delivery platforms to engage an agreed upon business transactions when operating in Seattle to protect the interest of consumers and restaurants.,29,,
168,0.97,1154.486,1166.331,"And the way to achieve that goal would be to amend existing regulations on food delivery platforms, that is Ss73.0.",29,,
169,0.97,1166.331,1178.31,"As a reminder, right now, food delivery platforms are required to enter into an agreement with restaurants before the food delivery platforms offer pickup and delivery services.",29,,

171,0.97,1190.389,1197.729,"That growing demand started Pre- pandemic, but it did sharply accelerate during the pandemic.",29,,
172,0.97,1197.729,1203.302,Food delivery platforms charge up to 30% or more for their delivery services.,29,,
173,0.97,1203.302,1219.284,"Although many restaurants are interested in providing delivery to their consumers and customers, if they're not able to provide those services in house, then food delivery services help to bridge that gap, so they he can provide that service.",29,,
174,0.97,1219.284,1228.493,Restaurants do have narrow profit margins with 10% or lower.,29,,
175,0.97,1228.493,1230.229,With more narrow profit flat forms.,29,,
176,0.97,1230.229,1239.705,"Restaurants have narrow profit margins, you can do the math and understand that high fees can equal drastically reduced profits.",29,,
177,0.97,1239.705,1251.083,"As restaurants are increasingly relying on food delivery, and customers expect this kind of service, it can add to struggles to stay in business for restaurants.",29,,
178,0.97,1251.083,1271.003,"And also was noted in public comment, there are about three major companies who are operating in the country for providing food delivery services and because of this marketplace dominance, restaurants do have limited bargaining power to negotiate fewer fees.",29,,
179,0.97,1271.003,1277.342,"As I mentioned, the use of delivery services did sharply accelerate during the pandemic.",29,,
180,0.97,1277.342,1294.126,"Noting the impact of these high delivery fees on companies, the Mayor issued a civil emergency order in April of 2020, that capped all fees for platform delivery services at 15%.",29,,
181,0.97,1294.126,1316.815,"A number of months thereafter the Washington governor issued a proclamation for across the state to have a 15% on just delivery fees capped, then an 18% cap on all platform fees, across the country there were numerous cities that were in states that have these emergency orders capping delivery service fees.",29,,
182,0.97,1316.815,1327.492,"In June of last year, the governor rescinded the state proclamation in anticipation of easing restrictions on in House dining that happened later that month.",29,,
183,0.97,1327.492,1339.104,"Presently, the Mayor's civil emergency order is still in place, but will expire upon the impending termination of the civil emergency.",29,,
184,0.97,1339.104,1354.186,"Trends of recent developments as I said earlier are just statistics on how food delivery services have grown through pandemic through now, and further growth is expected through 2026.",29,,
185,0.97,1354.186,1371.169,"Food delivery platforms are becoming a standard operation with 77% of restaurants, this is National data, offering services through these platforms and business resulting from these platforms facilitating delivery is 21 to 30% of current restaurant sales.",29,,
186,0.97,1371.169,1378.61,"Recognizing the need to address these problems, four cities have enacted laws that permanently cap delivery service fees.",29,,
187,0.97,1378.61,1381.98,"Minneapolis, New York City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco.",29,,
188,0.97,1381.98,1388.954,I understand that Portland is also considering a permanent cap on delivery service fees.,29,,
189,0.97,1388.954,1392.657,This legislation would permanently cap delivery service fees.,29,,
190,0.97,1392.657,1398.163,"It is similar to the emergency order, but does have some unique provisions.",29,,
191,0.97,1398.163,1408.173,The first is that it would clarify that there must be an agreement between a food delivery platform and a restaurant for any fees related to delivery services.,29,,
192,0.97,1408.173,1412.31,So there is mutual consent.,29,,
193,0.97,1412.31,1413.779,There are no surprises.,29,,
194,0.97,1413.779,1425.157,Next food delivery platforms would be required to provide delivery services for no more than 15% of the purchase price of each order.,29,,
195,0.97,1425.157,1435.7,What is different is there would be an option for restaurants to Opt-Out of the fee limitations and pay higher fees for additional services.,29,,
196,0.97,1435.7,1440.505,There would be conditions for that Opt-Out to pass legal muster.,29,,
197,0.97,1440.505,1456.321,Food delivery platforms would need to offer a service package option that includes delivery services for no more than 50% so there would always be an option for restaurants to pay no important 15% for food delivery.,29,,
198,0.97,1456.321,1464.696,Food delivery platforms would need to provide this option without penalty to their restaurant within 15 days of their restaurant's written recovery for it.,29,,
199,0.97,1464.696,1477.342,"Then restaurants would only be allowed to charge higher fees for services in addition to delivery services, which brings us to the question of what are delivery services?",29,,
200,0.97,1477.342,1495.927,"The legislation provides a definition that delivery services at a minimum would need to include listing the restaurant, and making the restaurant Discoverable on the food delivery's platform, and delivery services would not, and also, I'm sorry, facilitate, or perform the delivery of food and beverage orders.",29,,
201,0.97,1495.927,1507.873,"Delivery services would not include other services provided by food delivery platforms, such as advertising services, search engine optimization, business engine, or credit card processing.",29,,
202,0.97,1507.873,1524.256,"A quick note that the language on the slide is not exactly tract the legislation, so the legislation does say that the restaurant would need to be listed and Discoverable on the food delivery's platform.",29,,
203,0.97,1524.256,1526.791,It doesn't specify all Modalities.,29,,
204,0.97,1526.791,1532.464,Enforcement would be the same enforcement protocol as exists for the existing regulations.,29,,
205,0.97,1532.464,1549.014,"The food delivery platforms, the consumer protection division would enforce it, that division is in finance and administrative services would be a civil infraction with a maximum penalty of $250 to the food delivery platform.",29,,
206,0.97,1549.014,1554.619,Each day a violation would be a separate violation.,29,,
207,0.97,1554.619,1558.59,Restaurants could also have a separate right of action.,29,,
208,0.97,1558.59,1570.168,"Any penalty that is collected and retained by the city would be put into an account, in a general fund that would support outreach and education to restaurants on the regulations.",29,,
209,0.97,1570.168,1578.243,So that restaurants would be aware of the requirements.,29,,
210,0.97,1578.243,1584.683,The Pactive Affective date would be 30 days after the Mayor APPROVES the legislation.,29,,
211,0.97,1584.683,1588.053,The idea is that the current regulations would stay in place as long as possible.,29,,
212,0.97,1588.053,1599.03,Then the hope is that it there would be a seamless transition from the end of the emergency to these permanent caps.,29,,
213,0.97,1599.03,1604.336,Next steps is that the legislation would be introduced on July 26th.,29,,
214,0.97,1604.336,1605.07,It is not yet introduced.,29,,
215,0.97,1605.07,1610.675,This is just a draft that we're discussing today.,29,,
216,0.97,1610.675,1614.512,This committee would discuss and possibly vote on the legislation.,29,,
217,0.97,1614.512,1618.516,Then Council could vote on it as early as August 2ND.,29,,
218,0.97,1618.516,1628.493,"If there was to be a second committee meeting to consider the legislation, the earliest Council vote would be August 16th.",29,,
219,0.97,1628.493,1632.43,"That is it for my presentation, and I'm happy to answer questions.",29,,
220,0.97,1632.43,1633.098,Thank you very much.,30,,
221,0.97,1633.098,1640.505,I am going to give the floor to Councilmember Strauss as cosponsor.,30,,
222,0.97,1640.505,1642.273,Thank you chair Nelson.,31,,
223,0.97,1642.273,1647.045,Thank you to Councilmember Pedersen for allowing me to cosponsor this legislation.,31,,
224,0.97,1647.045,1661.393,I'm Cosponsoring this 15% cap on delivery fees that can be charged to restaurants so that our restaurants are able to continue surviving and thriving so that residents of Seattle are able to still order to go from their home.,31,,
225,0.97,1661.393,1673.638,"And be able to afford the sandwich that they want, as has been mentioned a few times, a 15% cap on delivery fees that was connected to the Covid state of emergency.",31,,
226,0.97,1673.638,1685.083,"It's important that as we continue Transitioning out of this deep part of the pandemic, that we are also able to keep this protection that has worked so well.",31,,
227,0.97,1685.083,1689.32,I want to thank Steve Hooper as well for bringing this forward.,31,,
228,0.97,1689.32,1707.539,"Chair Nelson, I think I've spoken to you about the different case counseling we do in Ballard for people who are homeless, homeless and Criminally involved, and just committing crimes.",31,,
229,0.97,1707.539,1718.049,"This has a direct impact on our economic vitality, our economic environment, and it was Steve Hooper who brought this, and started working with me on this last December.",31,,
230,0.97,1718.049,1726.524,"Steve, I just want to thank you for continuing to keep your eye on the ball on the things that restaurants and small businesses need most.",31,,
231,0.97,1726.524,1728.493,This is one of those things.,31,,
232,0.97,1728.493,1735.633,"We know that Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, all have enacted laws that permanently capped service delivery fees.",31,,
233,0.97,1735.633,1752.684,"So we have model legislation to go off of, so that we're not caught in litigation between small businesses and big businesses, because we know that we need both types of businesses to have a very vibrant city and economy.",31,,
234,0.97,1752.684,1758.757,So thank you chair Nelson for having this in committee.,31,,
235,0.97,1758.757,1764.929,"I will need to excuse myself for another speaking event, and then I'll be right back.",31,,
236,0.97,1764.929,1766.197,Thank you.,32,,
237,0.97,1766.197,1772.737,"I misspoke when I mentioned that this morning, you will be back.",32,,
238,0.97,1772.737,1773.071,I agree.,33,,
239,0.97,1773.071,1773.571,Thanks chair Nelson.,33,,
240,0.97,1773.571,1785.45,"Councilmember Pedersen, do you have anything to add before we open it up to comments and questions from our colleagues?",34,,
241,0.97,1785.45,1786.451,No thank you.,35,,
242,0.97,1786.451,1787.018,Councilmember Herbold.,36,,
243,0.97,1787.018,1798.329,"Thanks so much, Yeah, I do have a couple of questions.",37,,
244,0.97,1798.329,1804.936,So the slide 4 includes some background information.,37,,
245,0.97,1804.936,1812.644,Just wondering if the data provided is focused on national numbers or a local study.,37,,
246,0.97,1812.644,1831.362,"And also just wanting to ask whether or not the four cities identified here that have enacted laws to cap the delivery service, whether or not that's limited to delivery fees, or they conclude all fees that an App based delivery company can charge to a restaurant.",37,,
247,0.97,1831.362,1833.198,Thank you for those questions.,38,,
248,0.97,1833.198,1839.604,The data that I presented in today's slide show is National data.,38,,
249,0.97,1839.604,1843.107,I couldn't find Seattle specific data for these items.,38,,
250,0.97,1843.107,1889.387,"However, there is some specific data in the items for legislation, for example open table which is a reservation system Online, they are reporting that Seattle's bookings are lower and they haven't rebounded at the same rate across the country, which is indicating that perhaps more customers are maybe still ordering from their restaurant, or still eating at the restaurant, but getting Takeout, or delivery, or perhaps it's that there's fewer customers in general, which again underscores that restaurants are struggling to stay in business, and could need assistance, as they navigate the Post-Pandemic world.",38,,
251,0.97,1889.387,1905.003,"Also, our hospitality Association did indicate, and this is in the findings too, that restaurants incurred substantial debt during the pandemic, and it will take a number of years for them to get back to the same starting place as they were before.",38,,
252,0.97,1905.003,1917.949,"As far as the other cities, your question was about do they, how do they distinguish between all fees and then delivery service fees?",38,,
253,0.97,1917.949,1919.584,"And so Okay, let me think about tis.",38,,
254,0.97,1919.584,1926.891,"Well I know that New York City, I believe caps all fees at 15%.",38,,
255,0.97,1926.891,1929.56,And then that's it.,38,,
256,0.97,1929.56,1930.395,And there's no Opt-Out.,38,,
257,0.97,1930.395,1933.464,"Our emergency order did as well, correct?",39,,
258,0.97,1933.464,1934.065,Correct.,40,,
259,0.97,1934.065,1935.733,Our emergency order capped all fees.,40,,
260,0.97,1935.733,1941.973,"The state order distinguished between delivery fees and then other fees, 150% delivery fees.",40,,
261,0.97,1941.973,1946.711,Only allowed to charge 3% for other fees.,40,,
262,0.97,1946.711,1952.583,This legislation would just have the 15% cap on delivery services.,40,,
263,0.97,1952.583,1957.655,"So in San Francisco, currently, there is a 15% cap on all fees.",40,,
264,0.97,1957.655,1959.657,It doesn't distinguish between delivery and other fees.,40,,
265,0.97,1959.657,1981.846,"However, there is an amendment that is moving through their board of supervisors right now, that would define core delivery services with a definition that is very similar to the one proposed, which is delivery services are listing the restaurant, and actually performing the delivery.",40,,
266,0.97,1981.846,1993.858,"Then San Francisco would also have a provision where the caps wouldn't apply to food delivery platforms that met certain conditions, providing the 15% option, and making it available to restaurants.",40,,
267,0.97,1993.858,2000.331,So that is distinguishing between delivery fees and other fees.,40,,
268,0.97,2000.331,2022.387,"Minneapolis and Philadelphia both distinguish between delivery fees and marketing fees as well, having a flat cap on delivery services, and then allowing either restaurants to Opt-Out, or for the cap not to apply to platforms, that at least offer that 15% option, and then the platforms can charge more for additional services.",40,,
269,0.97,2022.387,2032.53,"So if San Francisco's amendment goes through, they would only be one city that doesn't distinguish between delivery fees and marketing fees.",40,,
270,0.97,2032.53,2035.933,That will be New York.,40,,
271,0.97,2035.933,2036.3,Thank you.,41,,
272,0.97,2036.3,2041.472,"Madam chair, one more Follow- up, if I could.",41,,
273,0.97,2041.472,2043.074,"Sure, go ahead,.",42,,
274,0.97,2043.074,2046.577,Thank you so much.,43,,
275,0.97,2046.577,2070.168,"To correlate what my brain is telling me here on slide five around the profit margins, and what we're proposing the cap to be, if profit margins are 10%, or lower as indicated on slide two, how are small businesses going to afford the cap of 15% or more?",43,,
276,0.97,2070.168,2071.936,It's a great question.,44,,
277,0.97,2071.936,2080.545,I think that it underscores that paying for delivery services is really hard for restaurants.,44,,
278,0.97,2080.545,2084.949,"And in some cases, restaurants may lose money on delivery.",44,,
279,0.97,2084.949,2102.3,"And so restaurants may want to continue offering delivery, because it could help the restaurant keep customers and get new customers and eventually will dine in house where there won't be this added fee to help them pay for their food.",44,,
280,0.97,2102.3,2112.343,"So I think your point is well taken that even with the 15% cap, this is going to land hard, or could land hard on restaurants.",44,,
281,0.97,2112.343,2123.988,"But in the interest of maintaining a customer base and having customers still have access to food, this is one way to address the situation.",44,,
282,0.97,2123.988,2124.422,Thank you.,45,,
283,0.97,2124.422,2152.517,"Just a follow up question from that, is this a 15% cap, we talk about it on the delivery, but is this a 15% of the price of the food or is the tax and whatever tip somebody might have given in the $2.50 hazard pay for drivers, is that all?",46,,
284,0.97,2152.517,2152.95,What is it 50% of?,46,,
285,0.97,2152.95,2157.155,15%.,47,,
286,0.97,2157.155,2160.958,It is 15% of the price of the food.,48,,
287,0.97,2160.958,2162.894,"It would not include taxes, fees or tips.",48,,
288,0.97,2162.894,2171.536,Just the menu price of the food.,48,,
289,0.97,2171.536,2171.802,Okay.,49,,
290,0.97,2171.802,2179.644,"And Relatedly, has there been any, in the olden days, restaurants if they wanted to deliver, deliver on their own.",49,,
291,0.97,2179.644,2185.816,Is there any information about Self-Delivery out there.,49,,
292,0.97,2185.816,2191.956,I have not been able to find information on Self-Delivery.,50,,
293,0.97,2191.956,2200.431,"What I've learned is that delivery is a tremendous part of restaurant sales across the board, because I think there's things like Pizza delivery, which have been around for a very long time.",50,,
294,0.97,2200.431,2210.208,"There's a lot of Pizza delivered, and I think a lot of Pizza delivery staff could be employees.",50,,
295,0.97,2210.208,2212.51,In House delivery.,50,,
296,0.97,2212.51,2216.447,But I don't know those Stats.,50,,
297,0.97,2216.447,2216.714,Okay.,51,,
298,0.97,2216.714,2217.582,Are there any other questions?,51,,
299,0.97,2217.582,2220.551,"Madam chair, I do have a quick question.",52,,
300,0.97,2220.551,2228.025,I might have missed it in the beginning.,52,,
301,0.97,2228.025,2238.536,"When Councilmember Pedersen was discussing this legislation, he and correct me if I'm wrong, there's a sense of urgency that we needed to do it soon.",52,,
302,0.97,2238.536,2240.605,I didn't really understand why that was so.,52,,
303,0.97,2240.605,2244.575,"Chair, I'm happy to speak to it.",53,,
304,0.97,2244.575,2247.778,Thank you.,53,,
305,0.97,2247.778,2251.716,"Council President Juarez, it's nice to sit in your old seat here.",53,,
306,0.97,2251.716,2256.153,"You could have used my blanket, it would have been fine.",54,,
307,0.97,2256.153,2256.487,Thank you.,55,,
308,0.97,2256.487,2261.792,The urgency here is that it's connected to the state of emergency.,55,,
309,0.97,2261.792,2286.651,"If the emergency is to end at anytime in the near future, we want to make sure not a gap for this type of legislation, so that small businesses and restaurants aren't having an uneven playing field for those moments between a permanent legislation and the civil emergency ending.",55,,
310,0.97,2286.651,2287.084,Thank you.,56,,
311,0.97,2287.084,2290.054,"Madam chair, may I ask another question?",56,,
312,0.97,2290.054,2290.921,I was going to ask Karina.,56,,
313,0.97,2290.921,2305.002,Have we gotten any information in the last two years about when we've been doing the 15% cap that from any of the restaurants or have we been collecting any data.,56,,
314,0.97,2305.002,2311.509,Did it kind of touch on that?,56,,
315,0.97,2311.509,2312.376,Maybe I Misheard that.,56,,
316,0.97,2312.376,2314.045,I'm sorry.,56,,
317,0.97,2314.045,2320.284,"Anecdotally, what I've heard about the 15% cap is food delivery services are complying with it.",57,,
318,0.97,2320.284,2323.988,Haven't heard complaints about it being violated.,57,,
319,0.97,2323.988,2327.258,I heard that restaurants are very appreciative of it.,57,,
320,0.97,2327.258,2333.431,"And I contacted Seattle police Department, which is the Department that enforces the emergency order.",57,,
321,0.97,2333.431,2338.869,They do not have records of any reports of violation.,57,,
322,0.97,2338.869,2352.083,"Nor does Finance and administrative services have any records of complaints for the existing food delivery platforms, regulations requiring the agreement.",57,,
323,0.97,2352.083,2354.351,Thank you.,58,,
324,0.97,2354.351,2354.752,"Thank you, chair.",58,,
325,0.97,2354.752,2360.491,Are there any other questions?,59,,
326,0.97,2360.491,2361.959,I have a couple.,59,,
327,0.97,2361.959,2362.693,How would it work?,59,,
328,0.97,2362.693,2369.4,"I remember Councilmember Juarez asked the question about the civil emergency, or what is the reason for urgency?",59,,
329,0.97,2369.4,2386.083,"So would it work that restaurants have to renegotiate because I know that the legislation says Opt-Out, and not opt in, so what are we anticipating for whatever existing agreements restaurants have with delivery services.",59,,
330,0.97,2386.083,2388.886,"Yeah, so, that's a great question.",60,,
331,0.97,2388.886,2418.649,"The legislation does say that restaurants have to Opt-Out, which means that when this legislation goes into effect, restaurants won't be charged more than 15% for delivery services unless they Opt-Out, and renegotiate their contract, which would be the opposite of if food delivery, but they have to opt in, then there could be a bump in the In-Between.",60,,
332,0.97,2418.649,2429.46,"And so, restaurants will need to renegotiate their contract if they want more than delivery services.",60,,
333,0.97,2429.46,2439.236,"They would need to renegotiate, and sign up, and pay for additional services if that's part of the offer from the food delivery platforms.",60,,
334,0.97,2439.236,2460.257,"I also wanted to mention in this presentation, although it was shared during public comment, that right now the three food delivery platforms that dominate the market, making up about 96% of all food delivery platform sales, all offer delivery services for 15%.",60,,
335,0.97,2460.257,2464.161,"There's a tiered plan, where it would be 15% for baseline delivery.",60,,
336,0.97,2464.161,2468.566,Could go up to 25 or 30 for additional services.,60,,
337,0.97,2468.566,2476.807,This legislation would make sure that tiered pricing plans like that don't ever go above 15%.,60,,
338,0.97,2476.807,2481.145,For the baseline services for delivery.,60,,
339,0.97,2481.145,2487.384,"So people could buy other services, if they would have the option.",61,,
340,0.97,2487.384,2487.718,Correct.,62,,
341,0.97,2487.718,2494.091,All right so--it's hard for me to see you Councilmember Strauss with the reflections.,63,,
342,0.97,2494.091,2496.861,It looks like you have your hand up.,63,,
343,0.97,2496.861,2500.798,"No, I'm good to go.",64,,
344,0.97,2500.798,2502.833,I have nothing further to add.,64,,
345,0.97,2502.833,2503.534,Thank you Council chair.,64,,
346,0.97,2503.534,2523.787,"You mentioned Karina, you did a comparison and you spoke of other cities that have done this and there are other models that we can go with some which carry more legal risk than others, so I'll be looking at those issues and I know that you have spent a lot of time also with our law Department.",65,,
347,0.97,2523.787,2532.396,"So if there aren't any further questions or comments from anyone, I'm happy to move on.",65,,
348,0.97,2532.396,2537.735,I didn't put it together that the actual legislation would be introduced the day before our next meeting.,65,,
349,0.97,2537.735,2558.155,"For some reason I thought we might have a little bit more time, and we know from pay up that the proposal changed significantly between the first discussion this year in committee and discussing the actual legislation.",65,,
350,0.97,2558.155,2559.056,Let's continue this conversation.,65,,
351,0.97,2559.056,2571.802,"I'm just saying I hope for a second conversation and vote on the 27th, and I look forward to talking about this more and seeing the actual legislation that is final.",65,,
352,0.97,2571.802,2572.97,"Chair, if I may.",66,,
353,0.97,2572.97,2573.237,Sure.,67,,
354,0.97,2573.237,2582.813,"You raise a really important point here, where pay up had a lot more time than it needed for introduction to final package.",68,,
355,0.97,2582.813,2587.151,That's in part because pay up was the first of its kind in the nation.,68,,
356,0.97,2587.151,2598.495,"What we've seen is this legislation has already been tried and tested in many other jurisdictions, and with San Francisco in particular, they had initially Crafted without the Opt-Out.",68,,
357,0.97,2598.495,2604.001,And that created a lot of tension between restaurants and the delivery services.,68,,
358,0.97,2604.001,2614.011,"And they have since gone back and added their Opt-Out, which has created a more seamless, and it's allowed for Coalescing around.",68,,
359,0.97,2614.011,2624.555,"I absolutely hear you that the similarity is delivery fees, and the differences are, pay up was first of its kind in the nation and this is a tried and tested model.",68,,
360,0.97,2624.555,2632.896,"It's good that we do have other cities that have done this, that we can follow best practices.",69,,
361,0.97,2632.896,2633.364,Thank you chair.,70,,
362,0.97,2633.364,2637.601,I'll be back in just a moment.,70,,
363,0.97,2637.601,2638.502,Thank you.,71,,
364,0.97,2638.502,2646.377,"If there's nothing else, will the clerk please read item two into the record.",71,,
365,0.97,2646.377,2648.812,"Agenda item number two, resolution 32056.",72,,
366,0.97,2648.812,2668.499,"A resolution related to the city light Department adopting a 2023 to 2028 strategic plan update for the city light Department, and endorsing the associated six year rate path for discussion and possible vote.",72,,
367,0.97,2668.499,2668.632,P,72,,
368,0.97,2668.632,2675.806,"Okay, will the Presenters please come to the table, while I key this off?",73,,
369,0.97,2675.806,2684.048,"This is the second discussion of Seattle light's 2023-2028 strategic plan, which SETS off the rate path that will follow.",73,,
370,0.97,2684.048,2691.955,"And this is not, we are not discussing and possibly voting on a change of the rate today.",73,,
371,0.97,2691.955,2699.363,We are simply discussing the strategic plan that is the foundation of the rate path going forward.,73,,
372,0.97,2699.363,2704.201,We will begin discussing the actual legislation to change the rates in August.,73,,
373,0.97,2704.201,2704.401,Okay.,73,,
374,0.97,2704.401,2730.994,"Cutting to the Chase to remind folks while people are assembling, at a last discussion, the bottom line for rate payers is that the average animal rate increase was laid out, and I believe that a six year average was about 3.5%, and the Seattle city light review panel has recommended adoption of the proposed plan, and endorsement of the rate path.",73,,
375,0.97,2730.994,2739.57,"So with that, I will let our Presenters introduce themselves, and continue.",73,,
376,0.97,2739.57,2740.337,Thank you.,73,,
377,0.97,2740.337,2751.181,"Good morning, my name's Debra Smith and I'm the general manager of Seattle city light, and I'm grateful to be here.",74,,
378,0.97,2751.181,2757.454,"Last time I was not able to be here for the full item, but we're here today, and looking forward to hearing any comments.",74,,
379,0.97,2757.454,2770.134,"I don't think we plan to do any full presentation, so we're just here to answer any remaining questions that any Councilmember, or your committee members may have, and hopefully be prepared to look for a positive vote.",74,,
380,0.97,2770.134,2774.204,So to my left --,74,,
381,0.97,2774.204,2775.072,Good morning.,75,,
382,0.97,2775.072,2776.44,I'm Kristy Grainger.,75,,
383,0.97,2776.44,2777.674,City light's chief officer.,75,,
384,0.97,2777.674,2786.25,"Good morning, I'm Lee Barreca, the city light's manager of strategic planning and performance.",76,,
385,0.97,2786.25,2787.184,Thank you for having us.,76,,
386,0.97,2787.184,2794.458,Thank you for coming.,77,,
387,0.97,2794.458,2797.494,"And of course, Eric Mcconaghy from central staff.",77,,
388,0.97,2797.494,2798.095,Thank you for having me.,78,,
389,0.97,2798.095,2804.601,"I'm glad to be a part of this, and I will tune in.",78,,
390,0.97,2804.601,2825.789,"So last time, the strategic plan laid out many of the initiatives and ongoing work that the utility is responsible for, and in the intervening time, I believe that city light has reached out to Councilmembers, or solicited questions from any of my colleagues.",79,,
391,0.97,2825.789,2833.764,I'd like to open the floor for questions or comments.,79,,
392,0.97,2833.764,2835.732,I don't see anyone.,79,,
393,0.97,2835.732,2847.844,"Again, this is a resolution adopting the strategic plan, and rate path, so if there are no other questions or comments from anyone--I have one.",79,,
394,0.97,2847.844,2854.618,"And it is simply, I think it was page, I don't know, 11 of the actual strategic plan.",79,,
395,0.97,2854.618,2861.825,I believe that one of the cost drivers incorporated into the rate path is inflation increases.,79,,
396,0.97,2861.825,2878.508,And I think that the one that's noted there is 7.1% in 2023 and that is partially to adjust for higher 2021 and 2022 inflation that we're currently experiencing.,79,,
397,0.97,2878.508,2885.983,"My simple question is, that after that, from 2024, to 2028, average inflation is projected to be 2.4.",79,,
398,0.97,2885.983,2892.823,"And I know that we have experts in our forecasting office and in your shop, you do too.",79,,
399,0.97,2892.823,2896.326,"But I just wanted to ask, is that realistic?",79,,
400,0.97,2896.326,2910.907,"Very good question, and certainly with this morning's news about 9.1% inflation, and I'm Busting last month's record breaking numbers over a 40 year banking numbers, it's hard to know.",80,,
401,0.97,2910.907,2922.753,"I think what we're very clear on, and what we're committed to, chair, is that we intend to flatten the curve, and I know we all talked about that during the pandemic.",80,,
402,0.97,2922.753,2927.491,"But we talk about that internally, with respect to rate actions.",80,,
403,0.97,2927.491,2937.134,We want subsequent future rate options to look like cost of living types of increases that our customers are experiencing elsewhere.,80,,
404,0.97,2937.134,2952.149,"So in the plan that we brought forward last year, before we had all of these inflationary measures, we have been moving towards that point, and we have been using 3% as a place holder for what traditionally, CPI increases have looked like.",80,,
405,0.97,2952.149,2960.557,That's why you see us taking a couple of years to get to those kinds much increases in our outer years.,80,,
406,0.97,2960.557,2971.902,"Our intention has never been to do what we've done before, which is to project lower increases in out years, and come forward in the early years have big bumps.",80,,
407,0.97,2971.902,2979.276,"Unfortunately, with the inflationary pressures we're experiencing now, we have to make an adjustment, and it kind of looks that way, and I'll be honest with you.",80,,
408,0.97,2979.276,2984.014,"Do I believe 3%, or that we'll be able to get there, it depends on what happens.",80,,
409,0.97,2984.014,2997.027,"But again, the commitment we've made, which is to hold future rate actions close to, or consistent with inflationary pressures that we are generally experiencing, that is our commitment, and it remains our commitment.",80,,
410,0.97,2997.027,3013.01,"So I'm hopeful as we all are, in talking with folks around supply chain disruptions, there seems to be a sense that at least those pressures will hopefully flatten out in 2023.",80,,
411,0.97,3013.01,3031.795,"So we don't expect it to happen before then, but we expect, in talks to some of the general Pacific, and some of the folks that we buy a lot of commodity products from, Mid-2023, or so, which would bring us back hopefully to more inflationary type numbers in 2024 and beyond.",80,,
412,0.97,3031.795,3035.432,"So I can't read the future, none of us can.",80,,
413,0.97,3035.432,3044.307,"But Rbing some of those inflationary pressures, and we will continue to do so, and our commitment remains.",80,,
414,0.97,3044.307,3045.008,Thank you.,81,,
415,0.97,3045.008,3053.95,And I have no idea how elastic our rates are to inflation changes.,82,,
416,0.97,3053.95,3056.987,You mentioned another one.,82,,
417,0.97,3056.987,3059.79,Supply chain.,82,,
418,0.97,3059.79,3060.724,There's also climate changes.,82,,
419,0.97,3060.724,3061.658,"Infrastructure needs, et cetera.",82,,
420,0.97,3061.658,3078.742,"We have some significant project work ahead, that we intend to talk to Council about, in the coming months, Undergrounding is one area that's a pressure area.",83,,
421,0.97,3078.742,3079.643,Is it Fort Lawton.,83,,
422,0.97,3079.643,3080.544,The infrastructure cost associated.,83,,
423,0.97,3080.544,3085.282,There continues to be a lot of uncertainty.,83,,
424,0.97,3085.282,3098.094,"But our commitment continues to work with Council to Prioritize unforeseen expenditures or needs, so that any rate impact associated with those are fully supported by committee and Council.",83,,
425,0.97,3098.094,3107.37,And my Committee is always open for any revisions.,84,,
426,0.97,3107.37,3107.571,Okay.,84,,
427,0.97,3107.571,3107.871,All right.,84,,
428,0.97,3107.871,3108.505,"Any other questions, comments?",84,,
429,0.97,3108.505,3119.282,"Okay, seeing none, I believe that we are about to go forward with the vote.",85,,
430,0.97,3119.282,3130.126,"I move that resolution, let's see, just a second, let me get to my resolution 32056 be recommended for passage at full council.",85,,
431,0.97,3130.126,3131.928,Is there a second?,85,,
432,0.97,3131.928,3132.329,Second.,86,,
433,0.97,3132.329,3136.5,"Okay, it's been moved and Seconded.",87,,
434,0.97,3136.5,3146.61,Will the clerk please call the roll?,87,,
435,0.97,3146.61,3147.477,Councilmember Sawant.,88,,

445,0.97,3168.265,3172.168,"Okay, the bill passes and will be moved for a final consideration.",97,,
446,0.97,3172.168,3173.069,"Thank you very much, chair.",98,,
