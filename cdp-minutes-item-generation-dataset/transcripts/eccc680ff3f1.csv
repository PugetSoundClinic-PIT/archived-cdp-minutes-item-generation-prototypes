156,0.7872323989868164,760.4,773.7,"I'll say more about this, but each of these organizations hires a very diverse staff with relevant lived experience, a long-term, long-term experience with harm reduction, as well and all of them, adopted trauma-informed and Folk.",,,
157,0.8181970715522766,774.3,782.4," To the work that they do with people in the hotels and all work to help people kind of stabilized, meet basic needs and address long-standing issues.",,,
158,0.8181970715522766,782.4,790.2,So that they are better able to move toward independent living and then most recently wheeler Davis conglomerate.,,,
159,0.8181970715522766,790.2,802.5,"And you'll hear from Dom, and little bit, has been adding Safety Services, the safety teams work in the hotels, especially in the evenings to, to ensure safety in and around the hotels.",,,
160,0.8181970715522766,802.5,803.5,And that's a really crucial.,,,
161,0.8181970715522766,803.5,804.1,"And also, I think",,,
162,0.9011930227279663,804.2,805.9, Ink unique feature of justcare.,,,
163,0.9011930227279663,805.9,830.9,"And again, that one of the things that does, in addition to promoting Public, Safety is creates a possible resolution of disputes and conflicts and disruptions that may occur especially at night, without relying on the police or 911 wherever possible, you know, I know that there's a lot of conversation about things that are happening across the country to address homelessness and related social issues.",,,
164,0.9011930227279663,830.9,832.1,As I've mentioned.,,,
165,0.9011930227279663,832.1,834.1,I think this holistic approach sets.,,,
166,0.894114077091217,834.2,834.5, Care.,,,
167,0.894114077091217,834.5,836.5,Apart from many of the others that we're seeing.,,,
168,0.894114077091217,836.5,849.0,"I think it's also worth noting that justcare intentionally sought and does work with people experiencing unsheltered homelessness and I'll show you some data later that suggests that this is an, especially vulnerable population.",,,
169,0.894114077091217,849.0,854.0,"And this is a therefore, especially labor-intensive work that's being done.",,,
170,0.894114077091217,854.0,855.7,I think just cares.,,,
171,0.894114077091217,855.7,861.8,"Focus on both individual well-being, but also neighborhood well-being, also sets it apart from other things that are happening around the country.",,,
172,0.9128388166427612,863.1,876.1," As far as we could, determine the fact that Jessica is able to coordinate with legal system, actors and resolve outstanding, warrants old cases, and so forth, is also relatively unique and really Builds on the relationships.",,,
173,0.9128388166427612,876.1,887.2,"That lead has established over the years with legal officials, the provision of on-site, Medical Care, and coordination of care for complex cases appears to be unique as well.",,,
174,0.9128388166427612,887.7,891.5,"And then, finally, I think it's notable that all the just care providers working in.",,,
175,0.9128388166427612,891.5,892.5,The hotels are able.,,,
176,0.8797334432601929,892.9,900.3," Significantly accent enhance people's access to all forms of treatment, but especially to medication-assisted treatment.",,,
177,0.9033867716789246,901.3,902.2, This is the part.,,,
178,0.9033867716789246,902.2,903.1,I'm going to skip through really fast.,,,
179,0.9033867716789246,903.1,905.9,So this is about our data and our data collection process.,,,
180,0.9033867716789246,905.9,910.6,We did a bunch of interviews with many people with participants.,,,
181,0.9033867716789246,910.6,912.9,"We had, I think this is listed on this.",,,
182,0.9033867716789246,912.9,913.0,Slide.,,,
183,0.9033867716789246,913.4,919.7,"We interviewed 42 part, justcare, participants many of them multiple times and the questions.",,,
184,0.9033867716789246,919.7,925.2,We asked ranged on the focus on the topics that are listed here in this slide.,,,
185,0.9033867716789246,925.2,931.0,And then these these transcripts were then transcribed by professional transcriptionist and imported.,,,
186,0.9037503600120544,931.2,936.0," To a qualitative data, Soft Data software program.",,,
187,0.9037503600120544,936.0,947.6,"And we also interviewed 11 Community Partners ranging from the people with and downtown, Seattle Association, various business Improvement, districts Etc.",,,
188,0.9037503600120544,947.6,956.3,"As you can see listed here on this slide, we did 12 additional interviews with justcare Outreach responders and other providers.",,,
189,0.9037503600120544,956.3,960.9,"We as I mentioned earlier, we also interviewed",,,
190,0.8568032383918762,961.3,978.5," Dude, leaders of central organizations and including acrs Chief Seattle club and co-lead but also reach and lead and then we spoke with seven liters of alternative crisis models who are centrally involved in those initiatives, across the country.",,,
191,0.8568032383918762,978.9,983.6,"We were also able to obtain some administrative data, which I'll be presenting a little bit of.",,,
192,0.8568032383918762,983.6,987.3,And then also 911 call data from the Seattle Police Department.,,,
193,0.8795192241668701,987.6,996.4," I wanted to start by just giving a quick snapshot of who justcare is serving and this is current as of February twenty eighth, twenty twenty one.",,,
194,0.8795192241668701,996.4,1017.5,"So, of course, these data, these figures will change very, you know, slightly over over time, but the important takeaway I think here is that the justcare population is about two-thirds by POC and slightly disproportionately male, which is actually consistent with what we know about, people experiencing unsheltered homelessness, and there's quite an age.",,,
195,0.7976680397987366,1017.7,1021.5," Changes all adults, but ranging in age from 20 to 74.",,,
196,0.7906660437583923,1023.2,1027.7," So I'll shift now to our key findings, one of the key points.",,,
197,0.7906660437583923,1027.7,1042.4,"I'd like to emphasize is that the idea that people who are living unsheltered or experiencing on children, homelessness are housing or service resistant does not borne out by the data, the just the people reach and others who are screening people in the encampments.",,,
198,0.7906660437583923,1042.7,1047.9,Determined that only 3% of the people they encountered were not a good fit with Hotel.,,,
199,0.7906660437583923,1047.9,1051.3,Living in only 13 have been exited from hotels.,,,
200,0.83600252866745,1052.3,1071.0," And once brought into the hotels and I or perhaps other people can say more about those rare occasions when that does happen, but the the take-home Point here is that the overwhelming majority of people are able to move into the hotels and are able to safely remain in the hotel's over period of time.",,,
201,0.83600252866745,1071.9,1076.6,This and I'll just I know you have this council members so I won't belabor this.,,,
202,0.83600252866745,1076.6,1080.2,"But again, these data just kind of support that previous point that I mentioned.",,,
203,0.9098408222198486,1080.9,1093.0, One of the key things that justcare does is it really focuses on addressing a range of issues that present obstacles for people to stabilize their lives and secure long-term permanent housing.,,,
204,0.9098408222198486,1093.1,1099.5,"So, case managers Outreach workers Outreach responders, work hard with justcare, participants to do.",,,
205,0.9098408222198486,1099.5,1106.8,"All of the things that are listed on the left side of this slide, and we found through our interviews with participants that virtually everyone.",,,
206,0.9098408222198486,1106.8,1110.3,"We spoke with was, it was engaging in at least one of these activities.",,,
207,0.8974074125289917,1110.8,1115.3, Tivoli and many in most cases pursuing a number of these different cold goals.,,,
208,0.8974074125289917,1115.3,1131.2,"And again, the important Point here is that this this respite this interim housing situation, looks the support that justcare provides enables people to address these issues which in turn enabled them to to pursue things like permanent housing.",,,
209,0.8974074125289917,1131.2,1135.6,This table just kind of illustrates the points that I was saying.,,,
210,0.8974074125289917,1135.6,1140.8,And these data here are based on co-lead specifically because they were not available for,,,
211,0.8838103413581848,1140.9,1141.8, For the other programs.,,,
212,0.8838103413581848,1141.8,1143.6,"At the time, we did this data collection.",,,
213,0.8258587718009949,1146.1,1149.2," We did however, so on the one hand, when we spoke to participants.",,,
214,0.8258587718009949,1149.2,1150.0,They express this.,,,
215,0.8258587718009949,1150.0,1151.3,Just tremendous relief.,,,
216,0.8258587718009949,1151.3,1161.1,"Sense of relief and almost euphoria that they had they were housed not only housed but house safely in a place that afforded them, dignity and security and privacy.",,,
217,0.8258587718009949,1161.4,1166.8,"And this just, I mean, I can't say enough words to convey How Deeply felt and appreciated.",,,
218,0.8258587718009949,1166.8,1174.0,"This was by participants of clear payoff in terms of emotional well-being, and psychic well-being for participants.",,,
219,0.9128393530845642,1174.7,1177.3," At the same time, there was this awareness and this was true.",,,
220,0.9128393530845642,1177.3,1178.8,Also for the Outreach responders.,,,
221,0.9128393530845642,1178.8,1182.0,We spoke to that the this was a temporary thing.,,,
222,0.9128393530845642,1182.0,1186.1,"Nobody knew how long it was going to be around and that people could be, it could end at any moment.",,,
223,0.9128393530845642,1186.1,1192.8,"So, there was this Paradox that we found that was quite pronounced about on the one hand, this tremendous sense of relief and security.",,,
224,0.9128393530845642,1192.8,1198.1,"On the other hand, this ongoing concern and this concern tended to grow the later.",,,
225,0.9128393530845642,1198.3,1202.9,The longer the interviews went on because people were aware of the precarity of the situation.,,,
226,0.9012529253959656,1204.0,1210.6, We also found that a justcare is effectively sick and significantly reducing barriers to access to Medical Care.,,,
227,0.9012529253959656,1210.9,1215.3,This is a population and this is true of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness in general.,,,
228,0.9012529253959656,1215.3,1220.7,"But this is a population that has extensive medical needs, both mental health, and physical health.",,,
229,0.9012529253959656,1220.7,1225.0,"And in most cases, also substance abuse substance use disorder.",,,
230,0.9012529253959656,1225.0,1233.0,"And so the fact that they're able to provide this on-site care and coordination, for more complex, Health needs is just really",,,
231,0.8928873538970947,1233.9,1239.4," For people and we have many, many examples that I'd be happy to share if people have questions.",,,
232,0.8928873538970947,1239.4,1244.5,The fact that justcare participants have significant Health needs is not unique to.,,,
233,0.8928873538970947,1244.5,1250.4,This is representative and typical among people experiencing unsheltered homelessness as these data show.,,,
234,0.9058837890625,1251.4,1256.0, These are the data specifically for justcare participants that we spoke with.,,,
235,0.9058837890625,1256.0,1259.4,These are the conditions that they identified themselves as having.,,,
236,0.9058837890625,1259.4,1264.9,So you can see that many people had more more than one significant physical and mental health condition.,,,
237,0.9058837890625,1265.0,1269.1,"Excuse me, in terms of Matt.",,,
238,0.9058837890625,1269.1,1271.4,We found that access to Matt was greatly enhanced.,,,
239,0.9058837890625,1271.4,1273.4,"This was, this was useful for some people.",,,
240,0.9058837890625,1273.4,1277.3,There's a lot to say about substance use disorder and treatment.,,,
241,0.9058837890625,1277.3,1281.0,I'll be happy to do that if people are interested in that Matt was especially,,,
242,0.8928426504135132,1281.3,1296.4," So, for some people particularly opiate users, it's not a Panacea, but it can be a very helpful tool and there is an important limitation there that it's a difficult to use in cases of alcohol, dependence, or for people who use stimulants primarily.",,,
243,0.8928426504135132,1296.4,1301.8,We also found that justcare is significantly.,,,
244,0.8928426504135132,1301.8,1306.8,"Improving Public Safety and Quality, quality of life, both for participants, and from Neighbors and their.",,,
245,0.8928426504135132,1306.8,1309.2,It's doing this work in a number of different ways.,,,
246,0.8928426504135132,1309.2,1311.2,"First of all, just by moving people out.",,,
247,0.8975200653076172,1311.3,1312.0, Out of encampments.,,,
248,0.8975200653076172,1312.0,1313.1,I won't say too much about this.,,,
249,0.8975200653076172,1313.1,1317.6,"I think this is well understood, but encampments are dangerous places for a whole variety of reasons.",,,
250,0.8975200653076172,1317.6,1323.3,"There's a lot of victimization going on, and I think, other folks, who will be speaking later, can say more about that.",,,
251,0.8975200653076172,1323.6,1335.1,"So, a lot of stuff, but also a lot of more serious forms of victimization in the encampments themselves, and the encampments themselves, also create Public Safety and quality of life issues for house residents.",,,
252,0.8975200653076172,1335.1,1337.6,So simply by moving people out of encampments.,,,
253,0.8975200653076172,1337.6,1341.2,Justcare is doing a lot of important public.,,,
254,0.9042131304740906,1341.3,1347.4," To work, it also enhances feelings of safety and quality of life for Neighbors.",,,
255,0.9042131304740906,1347.4,1350.3,"Both by again, addressing the encampments.",,,
256,0.9042131304740906,1350.3,1352.6,But also more generally by providing a place.,,,
257,0.9042131304740906,1352.6,1359.5,People can go to express their concerns to strategize around sanitation issues and other kinds of quality of life issues.,,,
258,0.9042131304740906,1359.5,1367.2,And one of the things that was really striking in our interviews with Community Partners is there was they also expressed a tremendous sense of relief of that.,,,
259,0.9042131304740906,1367.2,1371.2,"There's someone we can call who will respond, but they will respond in a way that we feel",,,
260,0.9001104831695557,1371.3,1371.6, feel good about.,,,
261,0.9001104831695557,1371.6,1374.6,We don't like the idea of a sweep.,,,
262,0.9001104831695557,1374.6,1378.0,"We don't want to just throw people back in jail, what?",,,
263,0.9001104831695557,1378.0,1379.4,But we do want something done.,,,
264,0.9001104831695557,1379.4,1386.4,"And this met our needs in terms of addressing our safety, concerns and quality of life concerns, but also getting people the services that they need.",,,
265,0.9001104831695557,1386.8,1395.3,"So I was a very powerful theme in the interviews and then an, in addition, justcare seeks to improve Public Safety.",,,
266,0.9001104831695557,1395.3,1400.1,And we believe does improve Public Safety by meeting people's basic needs in the hotel and the hotel.,,,
267,0.9001104831695557,1400.1,1401.3,"So, the theory of",,,
268,0.8880312442779541,1401.4,1413.0," Change here is that if people don't need to steal to feed themselves and so forth, then they will rely on illicit survival, strategies less, and that is definitely born out in our data.",,,
269,0.8880312442779541,1413.6,1416.9,It's of among the people who had knowledge that.,,,
270,0.8880312442779541,1416.9,1421.9,They sometimes previously relied on illicit survival strategies virtually.,,,
271,0.8880312442779541,1421.9,1431.0,All of them described a radical reduction in those behaviors once brought into the hotels and the Outreach responders.,,,
272,0.8880312442779541,1431.0,1431.2,We,,,
273,0.8161454796791077,1431.3,1435.0," We spoke with confirmed that and that was consistent with their perception, as well.",,,
274,0.8161454796791077,1436.5,1438.3,And this makes I think good and a good sense.,,,
275,0.8161454796791077,1438.3,1447.8,There's a slight wrinkle or caveat around for people who continue to experience substance use disorders for whom treatment was not yet available or an option.,,,
276,0.8161454796791077,1448.5,1450.0,That's a sort of complication.,,,
277,0.8161454796791077,1450.0,1457.0,"But overall in the aggregate, there appears to be a very notable, reduction in theft and other kinds of illicit survival strategies.",,,
278,0.7713595032691956,1459.3,1464.4," And then finally, by utilizing D, escalation strategies and creative problem solving in the hotels.",,,
279,0.7713595032691956,1465.1,1470.0,We believe that Jessica is dramatically increasing in improving Public Safety.,,,
280,0.7713595032691956,1470.6,1479.0,"This was true among the program staff and the providers we spoke with a really creative use of D, escalation, all sorts of examples in the full report.",,,
281,0.7713595032691956,1479.1,1487.5,"And then also, of course, the safety teams and I know you'll hear from Dom and just a few moments minutes, but the safety teams also relying on Alternatives, other than 911 to promote.",,,
282,0.9083993434906006,1487.6,1492.0," Keep things calm, and keep people happy in the hotel setting.",,,
283,0.9083993434906006,1492.0,1496.4,"So in all of those ways, we believe that 9/11, excuse me.",,,
284,0.9083993434906006,1496.5,1498.6,Justcare is improving Public Safety.,,,
285,0.9083993434906006,1498.8,1502.2,"This is consistent with our 911, call data analysis.",,,
286,0.9083993434906006,1502.2,1504.1,We can't draw any strong causal.,,,
287,0.9083993434906006,1504.1,1506.5,We can't make any strong causal claims here.,,,
288,0.9083993434906006,1506.5,1517.5,"But what we can say, is that the number of calls associated with the areas where the encampments were from, which people were moved out of encampments, when were lower in,",,,
289,0.8993807435035706,1517.6,1522.6, In 2021 than they were in 2020 by the percent shown there.,,,
290,0.8993807435035706,1522.6,1525.6,"And also that there was no, commensurate increase in the hotel's.",,,
291,0.8993807435035706,1525.6,1529.9,So we believe this provides additional confirmation of these Public Safety.,,,
292,0.8993807435035706,1529.9,1530.7,Safety benefits.,,,
293,0.8993807435035706,1530.7,1538.1,"And then, a key set of final findings has to do with the, the sort of Dakar sort of impact of justcare.",,,
294,0.8993807435035706,1538.1,1547.4,Just care providers are working hard to both serve as an alternative to 911 and neighborhoods and then also to avoid relying on 9/11 in the hotels.,,,
295,0.9125502705574036,1547.7,1549.9," And this of course, is the front door to the system.",,,
296,0.9125502705574036,1549.9,1552.8,"So that in that way, it has a, Dakar sort of impact.",,,
297,0.9125502705574036,1552.8,1566.7,"And I think significantly and importantly, the work that just scares doing in communities and neighborhoods in responding to and engaging with Community Partners is also important from a sort of a longer term cultural standpoint.",,,
298,0.9125502705574036,1567.0,1577.4,It's enabling people to understand what how and why that the police are not necessarily the best response to the issues that they face in their neighborhoods and that there are others,,,
299,0.805453360080719,1577.6,1581.5, that can provide satisfying responses to those issues.,,,
300,0.9006790518760681,1582.1,1585.0," So overall, these are our conclusions.",,,
301,0.9006790518760681,1585.0,1593.2,We think that a justcare offers an Innovative holistic and effective way of addressing a whole range of issues that are bound up with unsheltered homelessness.,,,
302,0.9006790518760681,1593.2,1604.8,"And I think again serves as a really important model for how to do how to address all of those issues at one time, which is a in our estimation, a very rare and novel kind of feature of the program.",,,
303,0.9006790518760681,1604.8,1612.0,We also think it's important that it meets the needs of both participants and neighborhoods and that it has,,,
304,0.8921760320663452,1612.1,1620.9," a variety of advantages over the sort of Cahoots model of short-term crisis response that are like, you know, spreading across the country as we see.",,,
305,0.8921760320663452,1620.9,1623.4,And I'm happy to say more about that if people would be interested.,,,
306,0.8921760320663452,1623.4,1625.4,Thank you very much for your time.,,,
307,0.8921760320663452,1625.4,1627.5,Dr. Beckett.,,,
308,0.8921760320663452,1627.5,1628.4,Thank you so much.,,,
309,0.8921760320663452,1628.5,1630.6,I actually want to follow up on that last comment.,,,
310,0.8921760320663452,1630.6,1640.1,You made a little bit because my understanding of sort of the difference of what justcare is doing versus like a model like Cahoots.,,,
311,0.8921760320663452,1640.1,1641.9,Is that justcare is even has,,,
312,0.860348641872406,1642.2,1648.8, More integration of resource to solve for a bigger variety of things.,,,
313,0.860348641872406,1650.1,1665.7,So it's sort of like a Cahoots Plus in some respect almost but but correct me if I'm wrong on that or feel free to expand as you just offered to because I think that is a really good point and I think we should take a second to expand on that.,,,
314,0.860348641872406,1666.4,1666.6,Yeah.,,,
315,0.860348641872406,1666.6,1668.8,I think that your characterization is accurate.,,,
316,0.860348641872406,1668.8,1672.0,"And so there are, you know, and many people who work.",,,
317,0.8199572563171387,1672.1,1676.6," With just with the Cahoots, tight models will say it's really unfortunate.",,,
318,0.8199572563171387,1676.6,1682.9,"We can respond in the moment and we can we have a prevented a police encounter with a vulnerable person, which is great.",,,
319,0.8199572563171387,1683.1,1685.2,But often there's no place to take that person.,,,
320,0.8199572563171387,1685.2,1687.0,There's nothing else they can do.,,,
321,0.8199572563171387,1687.3,1689.2,There are some initiatives.,,,
322,0.8199572563171387,1689.2,1695.1,I'm aware of around the country where they are trying to pair that kind of immediate crisis response with support.,,,
323,0.8199572563171387,1695.4,1702.0,"But you're right a just get the codes model itself, doesn't come with those longer-term, kinds of resources and",,,
324,0.9043977856636047,1702.1,1709.8," Or, and I think the other Advantage is that, you know, because there's sort of a neighborhood level focus in justcare.",,,
325,0.9043977856636047,1709.8,1714.7,So justcare builds relationships that with people who are in neighborhoods for long periods of time.,,,
326,0.9043977856636047,1714.7,1727.6,And in provides a sort of longer term way of approaching a whole range of issues that might be presenting in a neighborhood as opposed to individuals calling 911 and then having two or three percent of those calls were rerouted there.,,,
327,0.9043977856636047,1727.6,1729.4,Isn't that same neighborhood level benefit?,,,
328,0.9043977856636047,1729.4,1732.0,Those calls will be dispersed over a wide Geographic.,,,
329,0.8775684237480164,1732.1,1732.6, Space.,,,
330,0.8775684237480164,1732.8,1736.3,So you just don't get that same kind of geographic impact.,,,
331,0.88124680519104,1738.2,1739.4, Thank you so much.,,,
332,0.88124680519104,1739.7,1741.9,So why don't we open it up to other questions?,,,
333,0.88124680519104,1741.9,1744.7,"Colleagues, if there's questions for dr.",,,
334,0.88124680519104,1744.7,1755.2,"Beckett on her presentation, happy to entertain those scanning for council member Peterson, please.",,,
335,0.88124680519104,1756.2,1757.3,"Thank you chair, Lewis.",,,
336,0.88124680519104,1757.3,1757.7,Thank you.,,,
337,0.88124680519104,1757.7,1766.0,Dr. Beckett wanted to understand the geography of this current operation.,,,
338,0.8985845446586609,1767.3,1769.0, Where where are they?,,,
339,0.8985845446586609,1769.1,1771.2,Where's justcare going right now in the city.,,,
340,0.8985845446586609,1771.5,1781.7,"Well, our data kind of end our data collection period that ended in February March, so we may need to turn to Jesse or someone else to get any updates.",,,
341,0.8985845446586609,1781.7,1790.5,"But as of that time, the primary focus was in the CID and around the 7th and between 7th and 8th and Jackson in right in that area.",,,
342,0.8985845446586609,1790.5,1796.9,"And then in the Pioneer Square area, especially set the Second Avenue, Extension South, but I know there have been a few sort of other.",,,
343,0.8132146000862122,1797.4,1803.8," All Outreach efforts in various parks, and so maybe just so you could say more about those.",,,
344,0.888856828212738,1805.3,1806.9, Jesse want to jump in on that.,,,
345,0.888856828212738,1807.1,1807.6,Sure.,,,
346,0.888856828212738,1807.6,1808.0,Yeah.,,,
347,0.888856828212738,1808.0,1818.1,Are sort of legislated focus has been Pioneer Square and the CID we've done kind of a large focus at each one of those.,,,
348,0.888856828212738,1818.1,1819.5,And then more recently.,,,
349,0.888856828212738,1819.5,1829.0,We worked a little bit at 10th and deer bone Dearborn in the CID and we've been working all over Pioneer Square after Second Avenue Extension.,,,
350,0.888856828212738,1829.7,1831.6,The big lift of work was done there.,,,
351,0.888856828212738,1831.6,1834.9,We've worked around the pergola and there's some great success story.,,,
352,0.8502627015113831,1835.1,1839.3, From the pergola area and some good collaboration with the Hope team.,,,
353,0.8502627015113831,1839.3,1848.4,"And then we've worked along second and Main second, and Washington, and Occidental Park, and several other kind of areas that orbit around kind of that.",,,
354,0.8502627015113831,1848.4,1850.2,Core around Occidental Park.,,,
355,0.8232906460762024,1853.1,1853.8, How is Mary Peterson?,,,
356,0.8232906460762024,1853.8,1854.9,Do you follow up?,,,
357,0.8232906460762024,1855.5,1857.3,"Yes, thank you.",,,
358,0.8232906460762024,1857.3,1857.6,Thank you.,,,
359,0.8232906460762024,1857.6,1859.8,For explaining that geography.,,,
360,0.8232906460762024,1859.8,1861.6,And then for dr.,,,
361,0.8232906460762024,1861.6,1875.4,"Beckett, I with a look back from an academic lens and you know, looking at it critically in terms of the benefits and the outcomes.",,,
362,0.8232906460762024,1875.4,1881.4,And is there anything that is there anything to add to your analysis in terms of?,,,
363,0.9077628254890442,1882.2,1889.9, What could be done in other areas of improvement or something that you would because it's it's very positive.,,,
364,0.9077628254890442,1889.9,1891.5,"What you're presenting here, which is great.",,,
365,0.9077628254890442,1891.6,1893.8,I just wanted to offer that space for.,,,
366,0.9077628254890442,1893.8,1898.1,"Is there anything that from, from your rigorous analysis of this?",,,
367,0.9077628254890442,1898.1,1902.5,What else could be done or what else would you recommend?,,,
368,0.9077628254890442,1903.2,1909.3,"You know, there were a few, we offer a few small suggestions in terms of sort of program operation.",,,
369,0.9077628254890442,1909.7,1911.7,And some of the these things we actually,,,
370,0.8832939863204956,1911.8,1918.3," Really shared with with the team kind of along the way, and then made modifications in real time.",,,
371,0.8832939863204956,1918.3,1920.7,So they actually kind of don't end up in the final report.,,,
372,0.8832939863204956,1920.7,1922.5,But or they do like in a footnote.,,,
373,0.8832939863204956,1922.5,1928.0,"But for so, one example was, we did learn a fairly early on, in our research.",,,
374,0.8832939863204956,1928.0,1939.7,"We were hearing from some of the people that we were interviewing that they weren't getting enough food, and we shared that finding and co-lead, and other providers, you know, responded, very, very quickly and tried to figure out.",,,
375,0.8832939863204956,1939.7,1941.7,How do you do that in a hotel without a kitchen?,,,
376,0.8908098936080933,1941.9,1947.0," And, you know, and experimented with different responses and then and then ended up addressing the issue.",,,
377,0.8908098936080933,1947.0,1953.3,So that's the way in which it was also a developmental evaluation as we were sort of giving some feedback in real-time.,,,
378,0.8908098936080933,1953.3,1956.2,So some of those improvements have already happened.,,,
379,0.8908098936080933,1956.2,1964.6,"I would say, you know, I don't other than those things which we've shared in which are written up in our sort of Lessons Learned section of the report.",,,
380,0.8908098936080933,1965.0,1971.4,We don't have a lot of criticism because we feel like the interviews with participants were pretty.,,,
381,0.7446521520614624,1971.8,1977.6," Whelmingly positive and of course, you know certain people has certain issues with live.",,,
382,0.7446521520614624,1977.6,1987.0,"There were sometimes people would say, you know, there might be may be good to have more separation in the hotel's between people who are continuing to use and people who are trying to be sober things like that.",,,
383,0.7446521520614624,1987.0,1998.5,"But the overall sort of response was incredibly powerfully a positive and we could see for the people, we were able to track over time, some of the improvements that were happening in their lives.",,,
384,0.7446521520614624,1998.8,1999.5,I don't want to pay.,,,
385,0.7446521520614624,1999.6,2001.7,"I mean, we can't have our I think we have to",,,
386,0.8075559735298157,2001.9,2026.1," Clear-eyed about the fact that substance use disorder is a chronic health issue and it takes time to address and not everyone will see except be be able to do it in the way that might look like sis access to other people, but in those cases, I think the harm reduction success measures that were taken were really, really powerful in terms of saving people's lives, reducing harm, reducing disruption, and so forth.",,,
387,0.7986909747123718,2029.1,2029.5, Thank you.,,,
388,0.7986909747123718,2029.5,2031.3,I'll take a look at that report.,,,
389,0.7986909747123718,2031.3,2033.2,I just see that presentation online.,,,
390,0.7986909747123718,2033.2,2035.9,"But yeah, of course, circulated separately.",,,
391,0.7986909747123718,2036.2,2038.4,The report will be circulated shortly.,,,
392,0.7986909747123718,2038.4,2041.4,It is actually undergoing copy-editing as we speak.,,,
393,0.7986909747123718,2041.7,2043.6,So it should be ready any day now.,,,
394,0.7986909747123718,2044.4,2045.1,Thank you.,,,
395,0.9017145037651062,2046.1,2047.1, Thank you so much.,,,
396,0.9017145037651062,2047.9,2051.6,I did just want to ask maybe a process question related to that.,,,
397,0.9017145037651062,2051.6,2058.8,Will there be continued assessment of the justcare program?,,,
398,0.9017145037651062,2058.8,2059.1,Ongoing?,,,
399,0.9017145037651062,2059.1,2065.4,Dr. Beckett with your research to continue Along on it?,,,
400,0.9017145037651062,2065.4,2075.6,"Because I think that, I mean this assessment is also just helpful for the public record and just for demonstrating the efficacy of a lot of the things the program is doing and then it's very validating.",,,
401,0.8699859380722046,2076.8,2080.3," Is there, is there a plan to continue going on beyond the period?",,,
402,0.8699859380722046,2080.3,2083.3,Where your current report ends?,,,
403,0.8699859380722046,2083.9,2087.2,We do offer in the report which we'll get to shortly.,,,
404,0.8699859380722046,2087.7,2095.6,"We do offer a number of suggestions for data collection Improvement, which I think would enable a more robust and comprehensive kind of analysis.",,,
405,0.8699859380722046,2096.4,2100.7,"For example, we couldn't do a cost-benefit analysis with the information that was available to us.",,,
406,0.8699859380722046,2101.8,2105.9,"And then maybe there are other other things that we think could be really helpful, like doing pre.",,,
407,0.9034805297851562,2106.1,2108.4, And post elf outcome comparisons.,,,
408,0.9034805297851562,2108.7,2109.7,So there are.,,,
409,0.9034805297851562,2110.0,2119.2,"So there's a whole list of recommendations for data collection that I think would enable ongoing analysis, but I haven't, I'm not sure where things are with with that.",,,
410,0.9034805297851562,2119.2,2120.7,We just sort of finish the report.,,,
411,0.9034805297851562,2120.7,2122.9,So we're at that stage right now.,,,
412,0.9034805297851562,2123.9,2125.2,Thank you so much.,,,

420,0.7994424700737,2136.1,2138.5, Ask a clarifying question to best direct my questions.,,,

422,0.7994424700737,2140.0,2148.8,"Is that going to is that going to be more, I guess who's going to be in the next panel for, and should I be directing questions here or there?",,,

424,0.7994424700737,2149.9,2153.0,"I want to ask clarification to the, to the clerk.",,,
425,0.7994424700737,2153.0,2157.0,"I guess, Indie marketing, this between item 1 and item to.",,,
426,0.7994424700737,2157.0,2165.8,Are we going to get two more to Jesse and Dom and Victor on that panel or do we want or are they going to weigh in?,,,

428,0.8051337599754333,2166.5,2171.4,"And then I guess the first panel is prepped, is the presentation.",,,
429,0.8051337599754333,2171.4,2173.4,We just saw by Professor Beckett.,,,
430,0.8051337599754333,2173.4,2179.9,The second item on the agenda is a provider panel with agency and Victor and Dominique great.,,,

450,0.8033764362335205,2263.5,2265.0,I think can say more about this.,,,
451,0.8033764362335205,2265.0,2270.5,My understanding about sort of the reasons behind those decisions were in a few cases.,,,
452,0.8033764362335205,2270.5,2272.6,They were domestic violence situations.,,,

459,0.8467084169387817,2306.5,2314.8,I'm just trying to get a sense of whether or not they were involuntary exits or exits because there was a successful placement.,,,

466,0.8935093283653259,2340.9,2344.9,My understanding is that they already had housing through lead lead often places.,,,
467,0.87656170129776,2345.3,2347.7, People in motels and so forth.,,,
468,0.87656170129776,2347.7,2351.9,"So, that's my understanding from the reach providers that I spoke with.",,,

470,0.87656170129776,2356.6,2359.8,Could you just talk a little bit more?,,,
471,0.87656170129776,2359.8,2366.2,"I think you've touched on it somewhat, but your research has shown about the system.",,,

474,0.87656170129776,2375.0,2375.1,I mean,,,
475,0.7938519716262817,2375.2,2382.8," I mean some of them really obvious ones have to do with the paucity of permanent housing, both permanent supportive and just affordable permanent housing.",,,

479,0.9128382802009583,2403.8,2408.4,There's still this waiting period and so that's just kind of structural constraint that.,,,

487,0.8719537854194641,2433.4,2440.6,"And I think one of the other, this, this is hard to capture whether this is a exactly a system Gap, but I think it arguably is.",,,
488,0.8719537854194641,2440.8,2450.4,"One of the things that we learned talking to outreach responders is just how labor-intensive it is to do things, like, get people reconnected to the benefits to which they are entitled.",,,

492,0.785306990146637,2460.8,2465.1,And I don't know how someone could ever manage to do that while living on the streets.,,,

501,0.8422335386276245,2517.2,2523.0,And I think we have all heard from constituents who say that they want some,,,
502,0.9034440517425537,2523.1,2523.8, Need to call.,,,
503,0.9034440517425537,2523.8,2526.9,They don't necessarily want to call the police.,,,

505,0.9034440517425537,2529.7,2545.0,"And so what we're hearing is that people are just really thankful that there is a program like this, you know, where there are a bunch of different providers working together to try to address some of these really acute problems that are happening.",,,

990,0.8861441612243652,4933.5,4939.4, And to kind of follow up on something Ramon said and just acknowledge that you want.,,,
991,0.8861441612243652,4939.4,4947.7,I'm perhaps uniquely positioned here because my district district 7 has the balance of the justcare investment today.,,,
992,0.8861441612243652,4947.7,4963.4,So I've been doing a lot of work with justcare in my district and I'm not going to say who but there's a business owner in my district that was completely despondent over the state of chronic homelessness and in a row.,,,
993,0.8978407979011536,4963.5,4969.2," Their business had called the police numerous times that intervention hadn't resolved, anything.",,,
994,0.8978407979011536,4969.2,4975.3,"If they even got a response when police did show up, there was really not much, the police could do to solve for the issue.",,,
995,0.8978407979011536,4975.3,4977.2,"Finally, reached out to my office.",,,
996,0.8978407979011536,4977.2,4985.8,I was able to put that business owner in touch with justcare and then got some communication a few days later from that business owner.,,,
997,0.8978407979011536,4985.8,4989.7,That their issue was resolved and they were elated.,,,
998,0.8978407979011536,4989.7,4993.5,And the person who had been posing an issue for the,,,
999,0.9128385782241821,4993.5,4995.2, The business was getting the help.,,,
1000,0.9128385782241821,4995.2,5008.0,"They need with dignity with support and compassion and they no longer had somebody, you know, who would have a mental health episode in front of their patio, that was disturbing their customers.",,,
1001,0.9128385782241821,5008.5,5011.7,"So, I mean, just to your point, Ramon, I totally agree.",,,
1002,0.9128385782241821,5011.7,5023.4,"I mean, like, this is work where people are problem solving for everybody involved and leading with centering people's humanity and dignity and acknowledging that when people are",,,
1003,0.8824833631515503,5023.5,5025.6, Moved from the public sphere.,,,
1004,0.8824833631515503,5025.6,5028.2,"They will, when they're displaced, they go somewhere.",,,
1005,0.8824833631515503,5028.7,5031.1,And that has to be something that we plan for.,,,
1006,0.8824833631515503,5031.4,5040.6,It can't be something that we just assume they're going to vanish Into The Ether and not pose an issue anymore for the broader Community or a risk to themselves.,,,
1007,0.8824833631515503,5041.0,5053.3,So I just wanted to comment on that that I similarly have several anecdotes like the one you shared and it is it's really powerful especially at this time when we have so many people in the city despondent.,,,
1008,0.8857426643371582,5053.5,5057.5," Aunt because they feel like there's nothing they can do, there's nothing that is happening.",,,
1009,0.8857426643371582,5057.7,5059.5,And there's no one that wants to help them.,,,
1010,0.8857426643371582,5059.5,5064.7,"And like this model is proving that we can do this, we can do this.",,,
1011,0.8857426643371582,5066.3,5066.7,Okay.,,,
1012,0.8857426643371582,5066.7,5070.2,"So with that, I'm going to open it up to questions from my colleagues.",,,
1013,0.8201673626899719,5072.2,5073.5, Councilmember Strauss.,,,
1014,0.8201673626899719,5074.3,5074.7,Thank you.,,,

1019,0.8201673626899719,5087.4,5092.2,So so many others have not been able to find success within your finding success with this.,,,
1020,0.8201673626899719,5092.2,5101.9,"Because you're centering people, you're bringing the right resources and you and you're focusing on the human aspect of the people who",,,
1021,0.8868300318717957,5102.0,5115.9," Living outside, just for the record, you know, as I've passed requested justcare model to be utilized in the industrial area of Fremont and in Ballard at that time.",,,
1022,0.8868300318717957,5115.9,5123.0,I was reminded that your program didn't even have the money to continue operating this year.,,,
1023,0.8868300318717957,5123.0,5131.9,"So before I can look to expanding the program, I had to make sure you are whole just this year for the population of people that you are already working.",,,
1024,0.8255148530006409,5132.0,5133.5, Working with it.,,,
1025,0.8255148530006409,5133.5,5143.5,"Sounds like we have received good news on that front and I kind of bring it back to Dominique's point of, let's expand the program.",,,
1026,0.8255148530006409,5143.5,5144.0,What?,,,
1027,0.8255148530006409,5144.0,5148.1,"And so that my question here is, what is needed from you?",,,
1028,0.8255148530006409,5148.1,5149.6,Or what is needed from us.,,,
1029,0.8255148530006409,5149.6,5153.8,"What do you need to be successful, to expand the program?",,,
1030,0.8255148530006409,5154.4,5157.1,"I assume you, you need the money.",,,
1031,0.8255148530006409,5157.4,5161.9,"You noted that this is a Subaru, not a Cadillac and the Subaru is",,,
1032,0.8321413993835449,5163.7,5177.8," When you want to create results, it's not cheap because you're solving for the issue and by you, by making a down payment, that is higher than a lower-cost option.",,,
1033,0.8321413993835449,5178.0,5185.1,You're stopping the fact that you have to come back around because you haven't addressed the root of the crisis.,,,
1034,0.8321413993835449,5185.1,5190.3,"So, I guess I say that is, are you getting your contract signed on time?",,,
1035,0.8321413993835449,5191.4,5191.9,Is it?,,,
1036,0.9105948805809021,5192.1,5196.9, What money do you need us to do you need us to help in other ways.,,,
1037,0.9105948805809021,5197.2,5198.3,What do you need from us?,,,
1038,0.9105948805809021,5198.3,5200.9,I would love to get you into the Fremont area.,,,
1039,0.9105948805809021,5200.9,5205.8,I would love to get you into Ballard and I'll likely follow up with a phone call to each of you.,,,
1040,0.9105948805809021,5206.4,5208.7,So we don't so we can continue the conversation.,,,
1041,0.9006397128105164,5210.2,5222.0," Yeah, we only have funding until June 30th and it's a bit uncertain and it sounds like we're going to have to apply to a competitive process with the with the county could to continue to do the work.",,,
1042,0.9006397128105164,5222.0,5229.2,We're currently doing and that because the covid seven Council package from the county took an extra week to pass.,,,
1043,0.9006397128105164,5229.2,5229.4,It.,,,
1044,0.9006397128105164,5229.4,5233.6,Sounds like we might get some Bridge funding but we are very close to a cliff.,,,
1045,0.9006397128105164,5233.6,5238.0,And one thing da mention this but I also want to put out there.,,,
1046,0.9006397128105164,5238.4,5239.8,We do pay.,,,
1047,0.9030885100364685,5239.9,5245.2, A slightly higher rate than a lot of community.,,,
1048,0.9030885100364685,5245.2,5254.1,Nonprofit Behavioral Health Providers pay because we believe this work should be in the sphere of what cops and First Responders make.,,,
1049,0.9030885100364685,5254.1,5258.4,"So, just to sort of speak to the more expensive side of it.",,,
1050,0.9030885100364685,5258.4,5268.7,"It's not a ton more, but we have to have a viable Workforce, especially during this past year, during the pandemic and the quality of care.",,,
1051,0.9030885100364685,5268.7,5269.9,I invite any of you.,,,
1052,0.7376177906990051,5269.9,5292.7," View that would like to come to our hotel, the quality of care that our participants get from staff like Ramon and people like Victor and Dom's team is just unparalleled I think and I've worked in the behavioral health system for the past 20 years and a lot of that is because people don't have to worry about paying their own rent and their own bills that they can actually give their full selves to the work.",,,
1053,0.7376177906990051,5293.7,5296.5,"When I moved to Seattle, after I got my Master's Degree.",,,

1056,0.7758027911186218,5301.5,5306.9,I took a pay cut and it is just untenable especially at the rents that we pay now.,,,
1057,0.7758027911186218,5307.4,5309.1,So that's another important piece.,,,
1058,0.7758027911186218,5309.1,5311.7,"But yeah, to speak to the bigger picture around funding.",,,
1059,0.7758027911186218,5311.7,5316.4,We don't have a very long Highway in front of us around that.,,,
1060,0.7825573086738586,5318.0,5318.3, Thank you.,,,
1061,0.7825573086738586,5318.3,5322.9,"Just take away, Victor.",,,

1065,0.7825573086738586,5328.2,5334.6,"Cause my stress, I think beyond what Jesse has said, I think as we release a timing is really critical here.",,,
1066,0.7825573086738586,5334.9,5335.3,While we are.,,,
1067,0.7825573086738586,5335.3,5340.8,The we are told by the company that we had to go through a very competitive procurement process.,,,
1068,0.7825573086738586,5340.8,5347.0,"And again, we are talking about lives as act States here and stability or decline.",,,
1069,0.7724176049232483,5347.2,5353.6," So we serve, I would be very, very cautious and worried about dismantling and disrupting a safety.",,,

1071,0.7724176049232483,5359.4,5361.8,I also serve on the city of Seattle Community.,,,
1072,0.7724176049232483,5361.8,5367.3,Accountability board is a new board that just got change from safe and training committee.,,,
1073,0.7724176049232483,5367.3,5377.0,I reference it is because I know the truth is sport that we are being very creative about the funding allocation instead of putting providers through a very onerous process of a,,,
1074,0.7721845507621765,5377.1,5378.7," Okay, Ramona RFP process.",,,
1075,0.7721845507621765,5378.9,5384.2,I know the city has been thinking creatively about how to utilize other funding to really support.,,,
1076,0.7721845507621765,5384.2,5387.8,Provider's existing providers who have already demonstrated outcomes.,,,
1077,0.7721845507621765,5388.1,5398.9,"I see this as an opportunity and I urge the city council to be thinking about doing something different, or of the traditional pathway, what I understand the structure that the city needs to go through.",,,
1078,0.7721845507621765,5399.1,5400.3,But it has been done.,,,
1079,0.7721845507621765,5400.3,5407.0,"So, I just think that it's possible to even provide a one-time-only funding to get us over this process.",,,
1080,0.8575947284698486,5407.2,5417.4," And then thinking about how to provide a more long-term funding because again, time is the accent here and we are living in a very unusual time during the pandemic.",,,
1081,0.8575947284698486,5417.5,5425.0,"Even though we are now traveling and phase 3, but again, we will be dismantling A system that is working.",,,
1082,0.8575947284698486,5425.0,5437.0,"So if you ask me, we need is quick rapid funding support and then lock then think about long-term planning if we have to go through a competitive process or I",,,
1083,0.8997235298156738,5437.1,5441.8, I'd say as a service provider that again is something is really working.,,,
1084,0.8997235298156738,5442.1,5453.2,Why we create a will this has really proven to be something that is successful and I have always been proud to live in a city of Seattle that we are Innovative thinker Innovative City.,,,
1085,0.8997235298156738,5453.2,5459.9,And I think this is also something that I will speak boldly that this justcare program can be even replicated.,,,
1086,0.8997235298156738,5459.9,5460.6,Nationally.,,,
1087,0.8997235298156738,5460.6,5463.3,I think it's totally possible one.,,,
1088,0.8997235298156738,5463.3,5467.0,Last comment that I will may be young but just see how mention paying.,,,
1089,0.8876845240592957,5467.1,5472.8, But leading wage or more higher risk for the behavioral health providers or WDC staff.,,,

1093,0.8858792781829834,5505.4,5513.5,I was just so inspired by her from wanting to become a registered nurse because of the interaction to put a Jessica program.,,,

1104,0.7278124094009399,5550.6,5560.1,So I guess I just want to focus my question a little bit more and just be happy to follow up offline and have to follow the same with you Victor.,,,
1105,0.8579514622688293,5562.1,5566.0, Are there barriers one funding right now that you see?,,,

1107,0.8564660549163818,5574.4,5578.0,So I just kind of wanted to vote is are there barriers Beyond just the funding?,,,
1108,0.8564660549163818,5578.0,5584.8,And what I noticed notice from what Victor said is you need the financial stability.,,,
1109,0.8114798665046692,5585.8,5592.2, That stability aspect is what you're providing other people and yet is not being provided to you.,,,
1110,0.8073371648788452,5595.6,5602.5, A barrier is as we all know and hopefully many of the folks on this call are vaccinated or planning to get vaccinated.,,,
1111,0.8073371648788452,5602.5,5612.0,So tourism is opening back up and some of our hotels that were working in are no longer interested in collaborating with us.,,,

1282,0.8956082463264465,6642.8,6643.4,We did that.,,,
1283,0.8956082463264465,6643.4,6646.9,We no longer need to do that because encampments are the new jails.,,,
1284,0.8956082463264465,6646.9,6650.3,They are the new punishment for our unhoused neighbors.,,,
1285,0.8956082463264465,6650.3,6652.8,And so the approach that we take when we,,,
1286,0.8893754482269287,6652.8,6658.4," We go in obviously we already talked about that, but part of that approach is hearing from the businesses.",,,

1294,0.8767197728157043,6699.9,6712.7,"So it really took this like Community kind of Village of Outreach workers, who have established those relationships with business Improvement, associations, neighborhood, businesses and community members that dwell there to have",,,
1295,0.8208776712417603,6712.8,6716.3, like an understanding and an ongoing exchange.,,,
1296,0.8208776712417603,6716.3,6720.7,And so many of our lead project management managers at PDA.,,,

1298,0.8208776712417603,6727.7,6731.8,And it really took to us for us to provide that backbone function.,,,
1299,0.8208776712417603,6731.8,6737.2,It took those ties to the businesses and the communities that we had been working in for a long time.,,,
1300,0.8208776712417603,6737.2,6739.0,It just is a different type of approach.,,,
1301,0.8208776712417603,6739.0,6742.6,"It's more encampment focused, we still you.",,,
1302,0.8974946141242981,6742.8,6753.1, Why's the whole the whole approach we have in co-lead and the approach that we do in justcare is the harm reduction approach of taking care of people that was developed in the classic lead model.,,,
1303,0.8974946141242981,6753.1,6772.6,"But, you know, times have changed and the world is a different place and PDA is the last organization to be left behind when it's time for Innovation and to re-evaluate and we that's what we've done around justcare and it hasn't been just us most of what you see in justcare is because of the victors and the Doms of the world coming to",,,
1304,0.8436220288276672,6772.8,6777.2, The table with us and talking about what is needed and what works for people.,,,
1305,0.8436220288276672,6777.2,6780.9,So it's it's it's relationship-based.,,,
1306,0.8436220288276672,6780.9,6791.4,I know we get critical of that but it is that building of relationships with the people that live and work in those neighborhoods councilmember her bold and then being responsive and updating people.,,,
1307,0.8436220288276672,6792.3,6797.8,"We had a little snafu, but we're going to go back and update that neighborhood that we worked in and white center.",,,

1309,0.8078038692474365,6803.1,6809.5, He was also talking to the owner of the businesses that you saw in the picture and so where our other teammates.,,,
1310,0.8078038692474365,6809.5,6813.1,So it's about taking care of the people that are living on house.,,,
1311,0.8078038692474365,6813.1,6822.4,And it's also about taking care of the people that are trying to live and be in that neighborhood with their businesses or on their walk to the store because they live a block away.,,,

1349,0.7290703654289246,7081.7,7087.1,Literally it was mind-blowing because we have some incidents that happened in the streets in the community.,,,

1388,0.8977480530738831,7244.6,7260.0,"I want to make a disclaimer which I shared earlier during your presentation, that, that was my own analysis about conservative estimated saving, so it's in addition because we are again able to reduce hospitalizations urgent, care and incarceration.",,,
1389,0.8977480530738831,7260.2,7263.4,And I didn't just create this with no basis.,,,
1390,0.8977480530738831,7263.7,7267.1,I had also done Behavior work for many years and there's some,,,
1391,0.8293619155883789,7267.7,7273.3, Common cause analysis when I do when graph Grant proposal or do advocacy.,,,
1392,0.8293619155883789,7273.3,7281.4,"So this is actually in addition a conservative saving approach to what we had shared about that 49,500 months.",,,
1393,0.8293619155883789,7281.4,7282.6,But thank you for that question.,,,
1394,0.8293619155883789,7283.0,7283.4,Right?,,,
1395,0.8293619155883789,7283.4,7289.6,"So again reality, it's not unreasonable to expect that even with the programmatic cost of 49,000.",,,
1396,0.8293619155883789,7290.2,7295.5,"It's driving other systemic case, load changes where the system is saving.",,,
1397,0.8293619155883789,7295.5,7297.6,Money considerably in other.,,,
1398,0.8930385112762451,7297.7,7304.4," Areas, and that amount might vary person to person, but on average would be a based on your assessment about 22,000 dollars.",,,
1399,0.8930385112762451,7304.9,7306.4,Absolutely.,,,
1400,0.8930385112762451,7306.4,7317.7,"And the reason I can say that so confidently is because again, we're talking about a hundred percent of individuals whose crew substance use disorder over 80% mental health issues.",,,
1401,0.8930385112762451,7317.7,7327.7,"That justcare program will actually prevent residential inpatient mental health, treatment or residential substance use disorder treatment because essentially",,,
1402,0.7553756237030029,7327.7,7327.9, Ali.,,,
1403,0.7553756237030029,7327.9,7340.4,"What we are doing is inpatient treatment, but with a different model of care that I just referenced I feel really Austin missing and confident about the cost effectiveness of this program, I appreciate that.",,,
1404,0.7553756237030029,7340.4,7349.2,So not only is this responsive but this is also a program that in the long term is going to save money.,,,
1405,0.7553756237030029,7349.2,7350.6,So I appreciate you clarifying.,,,
1406,0.7553756237030029,7350.6,7352.4,That that's that's great.,,,
1407,0.7553756237030029,7352.7,7356.0,I want to ask another question and this goes directly to scalability.,,,
1408,0.7553756237030029,7356.1,7357.6,Like how do you vision?,,,
1409,0.843313992023468,7357.8,7367.4," Do this as best for Jesse, but whoever you want to delegate to, how do you envision the scalability with the hoteling component of this?",,,
1410,0.843313992023468,7367.7,7381.7,"Do you envision continuing the partnership with all of the rapid acquisition efforts to, to sort of have a couple buildings that are more permanently associated programmatically with this effort that are and that are always open, right?",,,
1411,0.843313992023468,7381.7,7384.4,Like a scaled alternative to jail.,,,
1412,0.843313992023468,7385.6,7387.6,Do you envision that or do you envision this being,,,
1413,0.8776265978813171,7387.7,7393.8, Being something where we're going to have to kind of continue to sort of lease spaces.,,,
1414,0.8776265978813171,7394.0,7404.0,Is there a way to use enhanced shelters or maybe some version of a tiny house model for this program as well.,,,
1415,0.8776265978813171,7404.0,7414.7,"I just like kind of some feedback on that because if we can if we can mix and match the modes like of where the units are, as long as they're like four walls and a door that locks.",,,
1416,0.8776265978813171,7414.9,7417.6,I think that opens up a lot of opportunities to pair.,,,
1417,0.8949785828590393,7418.1,7425.5, The programmatic treatment Outreach and services and I just want to hear your response to that.,,,
1418,0.7871689200401306,7426.7,7427.9," Yeah, it just really quick.",,,
1419,0.7871689200401306,7428.5,7429.5,Follow-up to Victor's.,,,
1420,0.7871689200401306,7429.5,7431.7,Comment on the cost savings.,,,
1421,0.7871689200401306,7431.7,7433.8,Those cost savings are two other systems.,,,
1422,0.7871689200401306,7433.8,7443.5,"Councilmember the jail system, you know, and the Healthcare System, but we're in conversations already about the largest Healthcare funding mechanism.",,,
1423,0.7871689200401306,7443.5,7448.1,There is and that's Medicaid potentially being able to pay for some of these services.,,,
1424,0.7871689200401306,7448.1,7453.7,So we need the partnership with local government from the spirit of innovation.,,,
1425,0.7871689200401306,7453.7,7456.4,"But once we have proof of concept, which I think",,,
1426,0.8320186138153076,7456.5,7464.4, Close to having we fully intend to hit up the other services that the city is not responsible for to pay for some of these.,,,
1427,0.8320186138153076,7464.4,7466.2,But that leads to your second question.,,,
1428,0.8320186138153076,7466.2,7469.3,And that's the hoteling or the actually housing part.,,,
1429,0.8320186138153076,7469.4,7472.3,We do need the city and County's partnership for that long-term.,,,
1430,0.8320186138153076,7472.3,7483.9,And so I do imagine what we call site control or having full run of purchased hotels that the county is doing and hopefully the city will entertain doing at the county.,,,
1431,0.8320186138153076,7483.9,7485.3,It's called healthier housing.,,,
1432,0.8320186138153076,7485.7,7486.1,I do.,,,
1433,0.8320186138153076,7486.1,7486.3,Imagine.,,,
1434,0.9030998349189758,7486.4,7490.6, Imagine that being the primary way that we would be able to support people temporarily.,,,
1435,0.9030998349189758,7490.6,7497.4,Although we're still open to having blocks of rooms at at local hotels that will work with us.,,,
1436,0.9030998349189758,7497.4,7500.4,And I do think the co-lead model could be easily applied.,,,
1437,0.9030998349189758,7500.4,7516.1,"The justcare model could be easily applied to tiny houses, especially if the tiny house, had its own hygiene facility and a mechanism, having their own bathroom and the privacy and the ability to lock a doors are two of the most Paramount things.",,,
1438,0.9030998349189758,7516.1,7516.3,And,,,
1439,0.7650904059410095,7516.5,7519.5," So are our reach partner, Nicole.",,,
1440,0.7650904059410095,7519.5,7522.3,Alexander has research tiny houses.,,,
1441,0.7650904059410095,7522.3,7529.9,"And as a lot of excitement and passion, for how we might work in tiny houses, from a harm reduction and person-centered way.",,,
1442,0.7650904059410095,7529.9,7534.7,"And I can even see, you know, the safety team in there with us in the tiny houses.",,,
1443,0.7650904059410095,7534.7,7546.3,"So I'd be excited to explore that option and think about what it meant to be in a tiny house Village, how the how the on-site Staffing would look and how we would work with other providers.",,,
1444,0.8963931798934937,7546.4,7554.8," And other partners to do that work, so we're in it to understand and explore and we would certainly want to get proof of concept around that team.",,,
1445,0.8963931798934937,7555.5,7569.9,"Yeah, that might provide a little bit more scalability flexibility at least for the short term as we continue to do like the health through housing, acquisition of additional units and Rapid acquisition through State money and other sources.",,,
1446,0.8963931798934937,7569.9,7575.5,"And because, you know, obviously the tiny houses could be scaled up a little more quickly.",,,
1447,0.9128384590148926,7576.5,7580.2," But in the long term, obviously, you know, we want everyone in permanent Supportive Housing.",,,
1448,0.9128384590148926,7580.2,7585.8,"So as we build toward that, so that's good to know that there's maybe that flexibility the last question.",,,
1449,0.9128384590148926,7586.1,7590.9,"I want people to be very honest with me about, I mean, I want people to be honest with me about everything, I guess.",,,
1450,0.9128384590148926,7590.9,7596.1,"But, but on this, I really want to ask your guys opinions.",,,
1451,0.9128384590148926,7598.4,7600.2,As if you could assume,,,
1452,0.9124815464019775,7601.3,7604.6, That that process and bureaucracy was not an issue.,,,
1453,0.9124815464019775,7604.6,7607.0,"Like I'm talking purely about logistics, right?",,,
1454,0.9124815464019775,7607.1,7614.8,Like if we wanted to do scalability and if there was money and commitment from this body to scale this model.,,,
1455,0.8283519148826599,7617.6,7620.1, Give me sort of like a step by step.,,,
1456,0.8422959446907043,7621.7,7626.2, Indication of kind of what would need to logistically happen.,,,
1457,0.8422959446907043,7626.8,7636.5,"And then I think we, as we as policymakers can assist in navigating process policy, intergovernmental conflict, legal issues, like whatever.",,,
1458,0.8422959446907043,7636.6,7646.2,"I just want you to like help me here at the end of this Committee, just assumed like if you could just go out there and and and and do it.",,,
1459,0.8422959446907043,7646.7,7650.9,What are the logistical hurdles that are in your way in terms of acquisition?,,,
1460,0.8422959446907043,7650.9,7651.2,Hi.,,,
1461,0.9128386378288269,7651.4,7655.2," Ring, Personnel operations.",,,
1462,0.9128386378288269,7655.7,7659.9,And and how would you go about tackling those things?,,,
1463,0.7998087406158447,7662.0,7663.8," And then, how quickly could you do it?",,,
1464,0.7998087406158447,7663.9,7673.8,"Theoretically, this might be one of those times where I, it's, I need to sort of huddle with the Brain Trust here, and get back to you.",,,
1465,0.7998087406158447,7673.8,7678.3,But I think we would need to go be intentional about neighborhoods.,,,
1466,0.7998087406158447,7678.3,7691.2,"We work in, we want to be mindful about who's living on house in those neighborhoods and make sure we're still prioritizing by POC folks and we would need to think about the workforce issues.",,,
1467,0.7998087406158447,7691.2,7691.6,Obviously.,,,
1468,0.8131296634674072,7691.8,7696.7, VA is interested in the spirit of innovation and a demonstration project.,,,
1469,0.8131296634674072,7696.7,7703.8,But we need more providers like Victor at the table with us to reimagine how they do homelessness and Behavioral Health Services.,,,
1470,0.8131296634674072,7704.1,7711.4,And we want to invite new providers and there's a lot of great work happening in the city and lots of great ideas.,,,
1471,0.8131296634674072,7711.4,7714.9,I think abounding around how to have alternatives to safety.,,,
1472,0.8131296634674072,7714.9,7720.7,"And so, how do we engage with other groups that are organizing and that want to lift up?",,,
1473,0.8582607507705688,7721.8,7724.2, An ability to do this type of work.,,,
1474,0.8582607507705688,7724.7,7727.1,I don't know the exact timeline.,,,
1475,0.8582607507705688,7728.0,7744.8,"I would suggest an intentional road map by neighborhood because even when we go into a particular neighborhood, we then have to prioritize sites within that neighborhood with all of the things that we just talked about the input from the community, the understanding of who's living there, the understanding of the impact on neighbors.",,,
1476,0.8582607507705688,7746.5,7750.6,And I do want to go back to one thing that you said councilmember and just offer a friendly amendment.,,,
1477,0.8582607507705688,7750.6,7751.6,I actually don't.,,,
1478,0.900936484336853,7751.7,7759.1," The mentally believe all of our people need permanent Supportive Housing, I think, about 20, percent of the overall justcare population does.",,,
1479,0.900936484336853,7759.1,7781.4,"But because I think of because of the six to nine month of rowboat robust stabilization and focus on case management, I actually think at the end of that time that six to nine months time, many of the people that may have looked like they needed permanent Supportive Housing, which is the most expensive model of Supportive Housing that we have actually don't they just need",,,
1480,0.8935948014259338,7781.7,7792.5, Sense of stability and they can go on to you know affordable housing that subsidize that don't necessarily need that high level of ongoing intensive support and case management.,,,
1481,0.8935948014259338,7792.5,7804.8,So I just wanted to sort of course correct that because I don't believe there is a lot of rhetoric out there about how expensive that is and we could never keep up building enough psh for the love of homelessness that we have.,,,
1482,0.8935948014259338,7804.8,7811.7,"And I think the just car mount the justcare model helps solve for that because a lot of our folks at the end of their time with us, don't need that level.",,,
1483,0.9051930904388428,7811.8,7812.6, Of intensive.,,,
1484,0.9051930904388428,7812.6,7823.0,"On-site on going forever supports, but in terms of the road map to scalability, I'd want to come back around, maybe we can get invited back and there would be need to be lots.",,,
1485,0.9051930904388428,7823.0,7834.6,More neighborhood assessment in neighborhoods that we don't currently have a presence in and we there's many more brains and really it's beyond me that we need to pull in for that.,,,
1486,0.9051930904388428,7834.6,7839.9,And of course the the folks here on the screen have their their agency and their Brain Trust.,,,
1487,0.9051930904388428,7839.9,7841.6,So it definitely is going to take a lot more.,,,
1488,0.8141699433326721,7841.7,7846.4, Thinking but it certainly can be done and we'd be happy to come back and talk more about it.,,,
1489,0.8141699433326721,7846.4,7846.7,I don't know.,,,
1490,0.8141699433326721,7846.7,7848.7,Dom or Victor Ramon.,,,
1491,0.8141699433326721,7848.7,7852.8,"If you want to add anything, what will judge my respond briefly to maybe a few.",,,
1492,0.8141699433326721,7852.8,7853.9,Were your points first.,,,
1493,0.8141699433326721,7853.9,7861.1,"I actually do, I want to apologize for making that mention on psh and that was mentioned by you know, like dr.",,,
1494,0.8141699433326721,7861.1,7867.7,"Beckett and from own and others have commented how people have been moving on to market rate, housing or other things.",,,
1495,0.8141699433326721,7867.7,7869.3,So I earlier in the presentation.,,,
1496,0.8141699433326721,7869.3,7871.6,So I'm sorry that I implied everyone would,,,
1497,0.9017857313156128,7871.8,7874.2," Psh, the other thing.",,,
1498,0.9017857313156128,7874.2,7879.7,I just want to get quick clarification on and then I do want to turn over to the other panelists for final remarks on this.,,,
1499,0.9017857313156128,7880.0,7888.4,Is it sounds like you're saying like sort of the the module for that it for expansion is to sort of go neighborhood by neighborhood.,,,
1500,0.9017857313156128,7888.4,7890.4,And that's kind of the Hub.,,,
1501,0.9017857313156128,7890.4,7901.6,"So it's sort of like planning, like maybe we would do like a Capitol Hill plan and a Ballard plan and like, a Lake City plan, and that's kind of the way you would recommend, we design and expansions.",,,
1502,0.9128385782241821,7901.7,7902.2, Strategy.,,,
1503,0.7567327618598938,7903.8,7909.4," Yeah, I think each neighborhood is unique getting to know the players in instead neighborhood.",,,
1504,0.7567327618598938,7909.4,7910.5,Who's living there.,,,
1505,0.7567327618598938,7911.0,7921.6,"We know from other experiences like drug use even berries, bye-bye neighborhood and and then just figuring out like who's impacted and those neighborhoods.",,,
1506,0.7567327618598938,7921.6,7933.5,"And then how we as a community, as a city, want to prioritize certain neighborhoods using core racial Equity values using values, you know, that we that we all honor and",,,
1507,0.7202566266059875,7933.6,7940.4, Been in the drive who we want to take care of whose most impacted by the criminal legal system and who's suffering out there.,,,
1508,0.7202566266059875,7940.4,7946.4,"So, yeah, I would, I definitely would want to do some sort of landscape assessment by neighborhood and have input to that.",,,
1509,0.7202566266059875,7946.4,7949.5,And there is a definite project management.,,,
1510,0.7202566266059875,7949.5,7960.6,"And, you know, with Communications around that like councilmember hurdle, talked about, you really have to dig deep and get to know who these folks are and where they're coming from and who's impacting, and the Nuance of each neighborhood.",,,
1511,0.7202566266059875,7960.6,7961.9,And it's not the same.,,,
1512,0.7202566266059875,7962.0,7963.4,"Wallingford is very, very",,,
1513,0.8992348313331604,7963.5,7965.4," Different than white center, right?",,,
1514,0.8992348313331604,7965.4,7968.9,We would not take the same approach to those two different neighborhoods.,,,
1515,0.8992348313331604,7968.9,7971.0,The response is the same.,,,
1516,0.8992348313331604,7971.0,7973.7,We still want to bring people inside and take care of them.,,,
1517,0.8992348313331604,7973.7,7976.8,"So that part is a done deal, but it's learning the front end.",,,
1518,0.8992348313331604,7976.8,7980.2,"And like I said, the justcare approach and we go into encampments.",,,
