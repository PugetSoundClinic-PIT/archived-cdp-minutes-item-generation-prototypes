187,0.97,980.412,982.281,I am Rence and I'm a resident of North Seattle.,22,,
188,0.97,982.281,985.484,I have been organizing around Land-Use and transportation issues for many years.,22,,
189,0.97,985.484,990.99,I wanted to speak specifically around North Seattle in regard to the dls discussion.,22,,
190,0.97,990.99,1001.734,We all know that stations at Northgate and 1/30 and 1/45 will not be enough.,22,,
191,0.97,1001.734,1004.336,"That line believe a lot of people out, especially in North Seattle.",22,,
192,0.97,1004.336,1010.442,"If we want to make it so that he will no longer have to drive, we need more transit in North Seattle.",22,,
193,0.97,1010.442,1017.75,I have written the E line.,22,,
194,0.97,1017.75,1018.917,In these people behind regularly.,22,,
195,0.97,1018.917,1022.054,"It is a great service, but the demand on the Aurora corridor needs a train already.",22,,
196,0.97,1022.054,1034.6,"As we try to revision our community, we need to serve it with High-Capacity rail infrastructure.",22,,
197,0.97,1034.6,1038.137,Please fund $3 million for Sdot to complete a citywide light rail plan by the end of 2022,22,,
198,0.97,1038.137,1039.738,City has a plan for the future.,23,,
199,0.97,1039.738,1040.139,Thank you.,23,,
200,0.97,1040.139,1040.739,"Thank you, Rence.",23,,

202,0.97,1042.741,1050.983,"Go ahead, Patrick.",23,,
203,0.97,1050.983,1059.792,I am Cochair of the Advisory board and a member of the levy oversight committee.,24,,
204,0.97,1059.792,1061.16,"Today, I'm speaking as an individual.",24,,
205,0.97,1061.16,1067.066,We were asked to participate on how to spend the licensing fee Oney along with other Stakeholders.,24,,
206,0.97,1067.066,1085.517,"At the end of the process, I felt like the plan produced which spent 75% of money on walking, Biking, and transit reflected the feedback and aligned with the values of the city as embodied by this plan.",24,,
207,0.97,1085.517,1101.533,What we are hearing now is that the work will be ignored and the new plan will spend 70% of the money on bridge maintenance and a whopping $40 million on interest payments.,24,,
208,0.97,1101.533,1108.507,"I am asking today that the Council not ignore the work of Stakeholders and accept the plan as proposed by Sdot, which provides funds for walking, Biking, and the like.",24,,
209,0.97,1108.507,1124.756,"These small projects will support the safety and health of Seattle residents, reflect our climate commitment, provide jobs in the community, and aligned with the funding commitments our city has made.",24,,
210,0.97,1124.756,1125.557,"Thank you, Patrick.",25,,
211,0.97,1125.557,1133.465,We have Ingrid and then Billy.,25,,
212,0.97,1133.465,1133.866,"Go ahead, Ingrid.",25,,
213,0.97,1133.866,1137.336,"Hello, my name is Ingrid Elliott and I represent 350 Seattle, a climate justice organization.",26,,
214,0.97,1137.336,1139.738,I am here to comment on the spending plan.,26,,
215,0.97,1139.738,1153.452,"At our group, we find it troubling that on the eve of earth day, council is proposing cutting $80 million in Multimodal funding.",26,,
216,0.97,1153.452,1156.455,These are the transportation dollars we need to produce climate destroying transportation emissions.,26,,
217,0.97,1156.455,1160.526,It accounts for 45% of our climate pollution in Washington state.,26,,
218,0.97,1160.526,1171.67,Infrastructure for low or no carbon mobility like Biking and walking is crucial to a healthy climate future.,26,,
219,0.97,1171.67,1173.705,It makes our city a better place to live now.,26,,
220,0.97,1173.705,1175.507,This is particularly true for residents who don't drive.,26,,
221,0.97,1175.507,1191.523,"We support the original Sdot proposal that invests 75% in walking, Biking, and transit projects and 25% in bridge repair.",26,,
222,0.97,1191.523,1194.626,Councilmember Pedersen's proposal to invert these investments is the opposite of what we need.,26,,
223,0.97,1194.626,1198.03,"On a Personalnote, my husband is a bike commuter.",26,,
224,0.97,1198.03,1200.299,He had a near Miss with cars about once a week.,26,,
225,0.97,1200.299,1212.511,He is also a doctor and SEES at least one patient per week who has had an accident directly attributable to the lack of separated bike lanes.,26,,
226,0.97,1212.511,1217.649,"He regularly talks with people who want to bike instead of drive, but they don't because they don't feel safe on our roads.",26,,
227,0.97,1217.649,1225.724,Bike infrastructure saves lives and reduces rare and tear on the roads and the claimant by reducing the number of cars out there.,26,,
228,0.97,1225.724,1238.47,"Finally, these active transportation projects, especially bike lanes, provide more jobs per project dollars than the larger projects such as roads and bridges.",26,,
229,0.97,1238.47,1241.139,"Thank you, Ingrid.",27,,
230,0.97,1241.139,1243.775,"Next up, we have Billy followed by KATY.",27,,
231,0.97,1243.775,1246.044,"Go ahead, Billy.",27,,
232,0.97,1246.044,1253.085,"Morning, chair and members of the committee.",28,,
233,0.97,1253.085,1254.286,I name is Billy Hetherington.,28,,
234,0.97,1254.286,1265.797,I want to take a moment to speak in support of Councilman Pedersen's amendment which is cosponsored by other Councilmembers.,28,,
235,0.97,1265.797,1273.405,This Council went a long way to college the need for increased maintenance funding to the of a structure with the passage of the Blfd in November.,28,,
236,0.97,1273.405,1283.415,-- the Vlf November.,28,,
237,0.97,1283.415,1298.03,Allowing this funding to be bonded to maximize its potential will go a long way in funding the backlog of bridge reservation and maintenance and provide a significant source of up fund funding in other areas that was performed over the last couple of months.,28,,
238,0.97,1298.03,1312.01,"While each of these was talked about during the Stakeholder process was important to the mobility of Seattle residents around the city, spending such a small amount of revenue across several areas is nothing to fix the glaring needs the city has.",28,,
239,0.97,1312.01,1315.847,The city cannot have another major piece of infrastructure shut down because of a lack of maintenance funding.,28,,
240,0.97,1315.847,1334.433,"In funding these funds to tackle a glaring need that was Spelled- out over last year's audit will bring hundreds if not thousands of living wage jobs as we climb out of a pandemic, but will also go a long way to shore up the need that was defined during the recent Stakeholder process.",28,,
241,0.97,1334.433,1336.802,I think you for the timing consideration of this amendment.,28,,
242,0.97,1336.802,1339.237,"Thank you, Billy.",29,,
243,0.97,1339.237,1344.743,"Next up, we've got KATY Wilson followed by Deb Barker.",29,,
244,0.97,1344.743,1345.077,Go ahead.,29,,
245,0.97,1345.077,1355.587,"Check hello, Councilmembers.",29,,
246,0.97,1356.154,1358.29,I am speaking on behalf of the transit riders Union.,29,,
247,0.97,1358.29,1363.395,We share many of the concerns that have been expressed so far by speakers about the proposed amendment to the vehicle license fees spending plan.,29,,
248,0.97,1363.395,1374.373,"We are concerned by the proposed switch from 75% of funds to go to safe streets, sidewalks, active transportation, and Multimodal planning, to only 25%.",29,,
249,0.97,1374.373,1376.742,We are concerned by the proposal to bond this revenue.,29,,
250,0.97,1376.742,1392.224,"Bonding can make sense, but given that $75 million is a small part of the needs identified four bridges, it is unclear what this will enable that is worth sacrificing $40 million of this source over 20 years the interest payments.",29,,
251,0.97,1392.224,1402.067,We are concerned that the Sdot process would be basically tossed out in this new proposal.,29,,
252,0.97,1402.067,1414.813,"We ask that you support the Sdot proposal or, if you think there is a real reason for bonding, it needs to be very clear what that will enable that cannot be done with just using the money as a comes in.",29,,
253,0.97,1414.813,1419.251,Thank you.,29,,
254,0.97,1419.251,1419.851,Thank you.,30,,

265,0.97,1478.81,1484.749,"Thank you Councilmembers and the Council chair for allowing me to speak on the measure that we are looking at, the amendment to Council bill 120042.",31,,
266,0.97,1484.749,1488.386,I am in favor of it.,31,,

269,0.97,1493.358,1502.934,This is important that we invest in our infrastructure as a way out of a possible downturn that we face due to the Covid-19 pandemic.,31,,
270,0.97,1502.934,1513.612,We have ridges and roads and other key infrastructure elements that we need to repair.,31,,
271,0.97,1513.612,1516.414,"By investing in infrastructure, we can create jobs that will strengthen our community.",31,,
272,0.97,1516.414,1531.663,"Also, we cannot forget that if we lose another bridge like the bridge that was lost in 2013, the collapse, it really impacted our Commerce and how we move our goods and services throughout the state.",31,,
273,0.97,1531.663,1538.737,We are also looking at the Seattle bridge that needs to be repaired.,31,,
274,0.97,1538.737,1540.171,That is another issue that we are facing.,31,,
275,0.97,1540.171,1552.984,There I a lot of comments saying that we need to add bike lanes and other transportation.,31,,
276,0.97,1552.984,1557.856,"If we don't repair the infrastructure we have now, we could see failure that could impact our region even worse than it did before.",31,,
277,0.97,1557.856,1565.497,"I strongly urge that we look and recommend and pass this amendment in favor, as it also creates jobs for our communities.",31,,
278,0.97,1565.497,1572.27,"Again, we speak about trying to get out of this possible downturn due to Covid-19 last year creating jobs, it only strengthens our community and makes us better.",31,,
279,0.97,1572.27,1574.306,Thank you.,32,,
280,0.97,1574.306,1576.908,"Thank you, Pedro.",32,,

288,0.97,1609.641,1612.31,We have known equity issues in Seattle and this situation should be improved.,33,,
289,0.97,1612.31,1618.35,We have been working with the organizers of the Internet for all initiative to deploy access among marginalized populations in Seattle.,33,,
290,0.97,1618.35,1622.721,While the progress has been great in the city of Seattle has been fantastic in its support.,33,,
291,0.97,1622.721,1635.2,We urge you can consider policies not for commercial purposes.,33,,
292,0.97,1635.2,1640.672,"We also encourage the expansion of fiber and High-Capacity network infrastructure in lower end neighborhoods, where it is critical to infrastructure like ours.",33,,

298,0.97,1662.46,1669.567,The city of Seattle asked Sdot to engage with community.,35,,
299,0.97,1669.567,1672.203,They did so with great care and with our time and effort.,35,,
300,0.97,1672.203,1676.474,I attended all of the Vlf meetings and voted on multiple aspects of the transportation plan.,35,,
301,0.97,1676.474,1679.744,We spent many hours meeting together and had been in discussions.,35,,
302,0.97,1679.744,1696.227,I was surprised to read that the city stated that 75% of the Vlf funds would be going to bridges.,35,,
303,0.97,1696.227,1698.263,This shows that our recommendations are not being taken seriously.,35,,
304,0.97,1698.263,1701.232,25% of the Vlf is not enough to address the other credible transportation needs.,35,,
305,0.97,1701.232,1703.301,"When we met, we came up with an equitable spending plan.",35,,
306,0.97,1703.301,1714.446,"28 percent responds to safe streets, 28% to save sidewalks, and 24% four bridges.",35,,
307,0.97,1714.446,1716.448,"In contrast, your press release is proposing 75% to bridges.",35,,
308,0.97,1716.448,1717.715,How is that being equitable?,35,,
309,0.97,1717.715,1719.751,Was that time a waste of our time and effort?,35,,
310,0.97,1719.751,1738.236,"Equity needs to be centered around all financial systems because of historical racism, lack of access in vulnerable communities, and how we have been disc diluted--excluded from the decision-making process in the passed.",35,,
311,0.97,1738.236,1745.343,Bipoc people have families who work and live within city.,35,,
312,0.97,1745.343,1747.212,Any live outside of King County because of Gentrification.,35,,
313,0.97,1747.212,1748.546,We need High-Paying jobs with benefits.,35,,
314,0.97,1748.546,1750.715,We have the skills to do transportation and have them work.,35,,
315,0.97,1750.715,1752.65,You're undercutting our time and effort.,35,,
316,0.97,1752.65,1753.485,Your actions have consequences.,35,,

332,0.97,1839.07,1846.678,It has a great deal of impact.,37,,
333,0.97,1846.678,1856.654,It is important to the city to maintain these bridges and to start repairing them before they fall down.,37,,
334,0.97,1856.654,1859.891,The West Seattle bridge should be a wake up to the impact that it could have.,37,,
335,0.97,1859.891,1861.526,We hope you move forward on this.,37,,
336,0.97,1861.526,1863.561,We look forward to discussing this with you in the future.,37,,

363,0.97,1988.252,1997.829,I am speaking to oppose the amendment Overwriting the plan to fund safe streets for bridge maintenance since that.,41,,
364,0.97,1997.829,2009.674,It represents an a Million- dollar cut to these projects.,41,,
365,0.97,2011.075,2015.48,"Sdot struck a careful balance in the spending proposal and incorporated stated priorities of safety, reducing climate emissions, mobility justice, and equity.",41,,
366,0.97,2015.48,2016.681,This amendment does the opposite.,41,,
367,0.97,2016.681,2033.164,"Instead of valuing input from equity Stakeholders, it offers a preconceived vision that we stopped using months ago.",41,,
368,0.97,2033.164,2039.37,"The proposal from Sdot would invest 75% of the Vlf in walking, rolling, Biking, and safety.",41,,
369,0.97,2039.37,2043.941,Overwriting that plan does not honor the process.,41,,
370,0.97,2043.941,2052.85,"Even worse, the bonding scheme would lock in these spending priorities for 20 years to pay back the bonds.",41,,

389,0.97,2130.428,2140.738,I wanted to weigh in in favor of the bonding to fund our bridges here in the city of Seattle.,44,,
390,0.97,2140.738,2144.575,I know it is expensive.,44,,
391,0.97,2144.575,2149.881,It is among the prices we pay for having a beautiful city full of hills and waterways.,44,,
392,0.97,2149.881,2153.15,It is not something we can ignore.,44,,
393,0.97,2153.15,2161.893,We are lucky also to have the best targeted local hiring policies in the country.,44,,

408,0.97,2246.877,2259.79,"Speaking as development director of Seattle subway, I would like to speak strongly in favor of allocating the suggested $3 million for the planning ahead part of the pie.",46,,
409,0.97,2259.79,2262.593,That can update the transit master plan with a real core identification component.,46,,
410,0.97,2262.593,2269.7,Speaking about how these relatively small dollars can solve a major headache ahead of time for Seattle.,46,,
411,0.97,2269.7,2279.944,"It also fails to bring light rail to half of the urban villages, where the majority of jobs and housing will continue to grow.",46,,
412,0.97,2279.944,2301.432,"We will regret a future where reopen a multibillion-dollar light rail downtown and in Seattle residents asked the city to expand the light rail to more neighborhoods and the city cannot expand because the Newtown town station platforms are not big enough, the cost is prohibitive, and it would be a major construction disruption.",46,,
413,0.97,2301.432,2313.811,"With an updated transit master plan, we can take advantage of the most rail and infrastructure friendly administration we have had in years.",46,,
414,0.97,2313.811,2324.955,It would be a mistake to Miss upsetting the city for success with the opportunity for another major Federal investment like we did in the 1970s.,46,,
415,0.97,2324.955,2326.39,Thank you for your time and consideration.,46,,

420,0.97,2339.637,2344.475,"Just a reminder to press Á6 to speak, Anna.",47,,
421,0.97,2344.475,2345.643,There we go.,48,,
422,0.97,2345.643,2349.58,All right.,48,,
423,0.97,2349.58,2356.687,"I am with disability rights Washington, a disability mobility initiative.",48,,
424,0.97,2356.687,2366.197,"We have a tremendous backlog of streets without curb ramps, cracked or inaccessible sidewalks, or no sidewalks at all, especially in more affordable parts of Seattle.",48,,
425,0.97,2366.197,2378.008,"This leaves old people who can no longer drive, youth, disabled people, and people who cannot afford cars without the critical connections we need to get around.",48,,
426,0.97,2378.008,2399.663,"Just last week, we were in Delridge filming someone who cannot get to the nearest bus stop without rolling down a street in traffic because of a missing curb ramp and inaccessible sidewalks.",48,,
427,0.97,2399.663,2401.866,"She used to live downtown, but needed to move somewhere affordable.",48,,
428,0.97,2401.866,2409.707,The more affordable areas in the city also often lack accessible pedestrian infrastructure.,48,,
429,0.97,2409.707,2410.875,These are the fundamentals of transportation.,48,,
430,0.97,2410.875,2414.345,"Without them, people without the privilege of driving lose the freedom of movement.",48,,
431,0.97,2414.345,2422.119,It is inexcusable in a city with as much wealth as Seattle at year that our basic mobility needs are underfunded year after year.,48,,
432,0.97,2422.119,2429.96,Thanks.,48,,
433,0.97,2429.96,2431.028,"Thank you, very much.",49,,
434,0.97,2431.028,2432.229,That was our last Speaker.,49,,
435,0.97,2432.229,2434.665,We will go ahead and move on to the items on our agenda.,49,,
436,0.97,2434.665,2437.468,"Items of business, item 1.",50,,
437,0.97,2437.468,2443.474,Will the clerk please read the title of the first agenda into the record.,50,,
438,0.97,2443.474,2455.586,"Agenda item 1, presentation: bridge audit repair and maintenance update and seismic safety needs update for briefing and discussion.",51,,
439,0.97,2455.586,2456.387,Thank you.,52,,
440,0.97,2456.387,2467.565,"Colleagues, as you may recall after the West Seattle bridge cracked and was shut down for safety reasons, I ordered a bridge audit.",52,,
441,0.97,2467.565,2474.071,The audit of the condition of the bridges that the city owns and it came back to us last year.,52,,
442,0.97,2474.071,2477.708,This is an update on the implementation of that audit report.,52,,
443,0.97,2477.708,2492.923,"And then also, there were reports about and changes to the seismic upgrade needs of our bridges to keep them safe in the event of an earthquake.",52,,
444,0.97,2492.923,2494.592,Costs have gone up for the seismic needs.,52,,
445,0.97,2494.592,2501.699,We want to talk about bridge audit maintenance issues as well as seismic issues.,52,,
446,0.97,2501.699,2511.842,"We have with us both the city auditor's office, as well as the Seattle Department of transportation.",52,,
447,0.97,2511.842,2518.949,"I think we are going to go ahead and start with our city auditor, David Jones and his team, Sean Debliek and others.",52,,
448,0.97,2518.949,2522.753,Thank you for your work on the bridge audit.,52,,
449,0.97,2522.753,2526.056,I hope you will highlight today the award that you won for doing that audit.,52,,
450,0.97,2526.056,2528.459,I will turn it over to David Jones.,52,,
451,0.97,2528.459,2529.727,Thank you.,52,,
452,0.97,2529.727,2547.177,"Thank you, and I want to thank you for inviting us here today to talk about the implementation status of the 10 recommendations we made in our September 2020 report on bridge maintenance efforts.",53,,
453,0.97,2547.177,2554.885,"For members of the public who want to read the report, you can find it on the Website of our office, which is Seattle.Gov/City auditor.",53,,
454,0.97,2554.885,2576.206,"Before I turned over to deputy city auditor Sean Debliek, will lead the presentation today, I want to note as Councilmember Pedersen noted that the National Association we belong to awarded our office's highest award for 2020 performance audit.",53,,
455,0.97,2576.206,2582.513,We got the award for the bridge maintenance report.,53,,
456,0.97,2582.513,2592.289,The judges really liked the evidence we presented in the report that supported the main message.,53,,
457,0.97,2592.289,2595.759,Sean will be talking about the need for Seattle to develop a strategic plan for bridge maintenance.,53,,
458,0.97,2595.759,2605.903,"I want to congratulate members of our offense who produced this report, as they had to operate under severe time restraints in the midst of a pandemic.",53,,
459,0.97,2605.903,2608.939,I want to thank chair Pedersen.,53,,
460,0.97,2608.939,2611.742,"Sean, take it away.",53,,
461,0.97,2611.742,2617.247,Great.,54,,
462,0.97,2617.247,2617.915,"Thank you, David.",54,,
463,0.97,2617.915,2619.516,"Thank you, Councilmembers, for having us here today.",54,,
464,0.97,2619.516,2632.73,"I am Sean Debliek, the deputy city auditor with the office of city auditor.",54,,
465,0.97,2632.73,2645.876,"I will walk through the status of Sdot's recommendation of the 10 recommendations that were published in our September report, which is shown on the screen here.",54,,
466,0.97,2645.876,2652.85,"Because Sdot is joining us today, they can provide further details on each recommendation and provide details on the Timeline, Prioritization, and efforts that they are currently engaged in to make these recommendations a reality.",54,,
467,0.97,2652.85,2656.453,The three key messages I want to convey to you all today are as follows.,54,,
468,0.97,2656.453,2659.757,"First off, Sdot is in the process of implementing our 10 recommendations.",54,,
469,0.97,2659.757,2668.666,"Though they are not complete, where they are makes sense.",54,,
470,0.97,2668.666,2672.102,"From what we have seen, their efforts show that they are taking these recommendations very seriously.",54,,
471,0.97,2672.102,2674.571,"Second, they committed to completing all 10 of these recommendations by 2023.",54,,
472,0.97,2674.571,2676.407,They seem to be on track to get there.,54,,
473,0.97,2676.407,2685.516,"Finally, given the limited amount of time that passed, we cannot say with certainty that the Timeline will be met.",54,,
474,0.97,2685.516,2696.293,Sdot needs to complete the planning work that is currently engaged in to determine what resources they will need to get these items done within the Timeline they have committed.,54,,
475,0.97,2696.293,2698.729,This first slide shows the key Takeaways from our 2020 report.,54,,
476,0.97,2698.729,2705.936,This is what we put out back in September after looking at the bridge maintenance program and condition data.,54,,
477,0.97,2705.936,2709.106,"Like the rest of the country, our bridges in the city are not in good shape.",54,,
478,0.97,2709.106,2731.462,"The second big point is that Sdot is meeting the expenditure targets that have been set, but the amount budgeted for bridge maintenance in our city is far below what is needed.",54,,
479,0.97,2731.462,2736.133,"If you look at our report, you will see that historically about $6.6 million per year has been budgeted for this important work.",54,,
480,0.97,2736.133,2739.403,"At the same time, Sdot estimates it will need $34 million per year for maintenance needs.",54,,
481,0.97,2739.403,2746.143,Accurate estimates of the need and several other issues need to be addressed for Sdot to establish more strategic bridge preservation programs.,54,,
482,0.97,2746.143,2758.989,"Our 10 recommendations lay a path forward to get there to move from a Reactive approach to a more Proactive, strategic approach for the entire bridge portfolio.",54,,
483,0.97,2758.989,2773.704,"Lastly, Sdot agreed to limit all of our recommendations and reported that all of the items would be completed by the end of either 2022 or 2023.",54,,
484,0.97,2773.704,2775.305,The next five slides are very text heavy.,54,,
485,0.97,2775.305,2777.775,These show each of the recommendations that we made back in September.,54,,
486,0.97,2777.775,2784.815,It also shows the response of the time from Sdot on what they planned to do.,54,,
487,0.97,2784.815,2792.189,"As we go through each one of these can we will talk about what I thought has done, the current status about six months after that report.",54,,
488,0.97,2792.189,2801.498,"This slide shows two recommendations, number one and number seven.",54,,
489,0.97,2801.498,2807.804,"As of September, Sdot planned to complete these by the end of 2022.",54,,
490,0.97,2807.804,2809.64,The column in the middle is our recommendation.,54,,
491,0.97,2809.64,2812.643,The column on the right is what Sdot planned to do in 2020.,54,,
492,0.97,2812.643,2823.52,"As of April 2021, recommendation one is the Highestpriority in the Workplan.",54,,
493,0.97,2823.52,2832.229,"To this end, Sdot created a position that has a staff member in place who is doing the necessary planning to implement the recommendations and all the other ones in this audit.",54,,
494,0.97,2832.229,2833.23,This is all good news.,54,,
495,0.97,2833.23,2846.977,"When item that needs to be completed, and as I told us they were in the midst of doing this, is they understand the resources it would take to make this in the remaining recommendations a reality.",54,,
496,0.97,2846.977,2851.281,"When Sdot gives their presentation, I think they can talk more about where they are specifically.",54,,
497,0.97,2851.281,2865.195,"Recommendation seven, this one is a Desktop exercise that may be delayed beyond 2022 based on the Prioritization process that they went through, looking at the recommendations.",54,,
498,0.97,2865.195,2866.096,"To us, this makes sense.",54,,
499,0.97,2866.096,2869.933,The outcomes from the Lifecycle cost analysis and other recommendations will drive the limitation of this recommendation.,54,,
500,0.97,2869.933,2872.202,It may be pushed to 2023.,54,,
501,0.97,2872.202,2873.904,That seems to be okay.,54,,
502,0.97,2873.904,2891.922,These next flu--few slides focus on were Clinicians implemented by the end of 2023.,54,,
503,0.97,2891.922,2894.791,According to Sdot intends to complete all these were conditions during this time period.,54,,
504,0.97,2894.791,2900.03,"As I mentioned in my introduction, the evidence that we have seen today does not suggest that they will not be able to meet that Timeline.",54,,
505,0.97,2900.03,2907.137,"This is my auditor way of saying that much time has passed, but given what we have seen so far, they can meet these goals and seem like they are on track to do so.",54,,
506,0.97,2907.137,2913.51,"Recommendation number two, this has to do with Reimbursable work, work that Sdot does that generates revenue to pay for some of the staff in this division.",54,,
507,0.97,2913.51,2923.754,They also keep our ridges in working order.,54,,
508,0.97,2923.754,2928.058,This particular recommendation is dependent on the results of a staffing analysis that I will get to on the next slide.,54,,
509,0.97,2928.058,2934.264,"What I want to point out here is that, according to's document implementing this is a high priority and work is underway to do a staffing analysis.",54,,
510,0.97,2934.264,2936.566,Sdot can provide more details in their presentation.,54,,
511,0.97,2936.566,2945.876,Recommendation number three deals with a historic ordinance from the 1960s there requires as not to frequently inspect private businesses and bridges.,54,,
512,0.97,2945.876,2953.65,"60 years ago, it made sense.",54,,
513,0.97,2953.65,2954.885,It may not make sense anymore.,54,,
514,0.97,2954.885,2957.054,This has been put lower on the priority list.,54,,
515,0.97,2957.054,2959.556,They told us they may be able to complete this recommendation faster than planned.,54,,
516,0.97,2959.556,2960.991,Perhaps we can see that this year.,54,,
517,0.97,2960.991,2965.162,"Recommendation number four, this one is dependent on the previous recommendation.",54,,
518,0.97,2965.162,2972.002,It is not something we have seen progress on until the prior recommendation is complete.,54,,
519,0.97,2972.002,2978.275,"Sdot is able to complete recommendation number three this year or sooner, than this one would soon follow.",54,,
520,0.97,2978.275,2988.618,That is good news.,54,,
521,0.97,2990.887,2992.489,Recommendation five focuses on the staffing analysis.,54,,
522,0.97,2992.489,2996.259,The bottom line is that Sdot is in the early planning stages for how to do the staffing analysis.,54,,
523,0.97,2996.259,3000.797,It seems likely that they will be able to meet their commitment to get this recommendation done by the end of 2023.,54,,
524,0.97,3000.797,3003.567,They will have more detail on where they are at during their presentation.,54,,
525,0.97,3003.567,3012.943,"Recommendation six, this is a very important recommendation that highlights the need for Sdot to include the race and social justice values for the city into the staffing analysis.",54,,
526,0.97,3012.943,3023.153,"As shown here in the plan, Sdot is committed to using the racial equity tool kit to influence the analysis.",54,,
527,0.97,3023.153,3029.359,We would see that embedded when the previous recommendation is implemented.,54,,
528,0.97,3029.359,3041.071,Recommendation number eight is shifting gears from human capital to focus on the estimated useful life of our bridges.,54,,
529,0.97,3041.071,3044.875,Our recommendation is to update the information and base it on a component by component condition data.,54,,
530,0.97,3044.875,3055.786,"According to Sdot, part of the work that this new staff person is doing this year is project planning for what needs to be done to get to this.",54,,
531,0.97,3055.786,3063.96,This would be a pretty significant body of work.,54,,
532,0.97,3063.96,3066.997,"As mentioned earlier, Sdot seem to be where they should be at this point in time.",54,,
533,0.97,3066.997,3070.667,It will be important for Sdot to share their resources to get there once they are known.,54,,
534,0.97,3070.667,3073.103,"Recommendation nine, and this is the last slide of my heavily taxed slides.",54,,
535,0.97,3073.103,3075.105,This builds off of recommendation eight.,54,,
536,0.97,3075.105,3076.907,This can inform the staffing analysis.,54,,
537,0.97,3076.907,3086.917,"And others, it seems that Sdot is at this stage we would expect for completing these by 2023.",54,,
538,0.97,3086.917,3094.424,"And then Finally, recommendation number 10 is the Capstone of all the 10 recommendations that we made.",54,,
539,0.97,3094.424,3098.161,"For this particular one, Sdot is optimistic he can get this recommendation done by the end of 2023.",54,,
540,0.97,3098.161,3102.532,Getting it done in that time period is ambitious.,54,,
541,0.97,3102.532,3108.038,We are cautiously optimistic about them getting this particular one complete.,54,,
542,0.97,3108.038,3123.253,"In order to have a really comprehensive, Proactive, strategic asset management plan, Sdot has to do quality work on the other nine recommendations.",54,,
543,0.97,3123.253,3137.267,"So spending the time necessary to do quality work on getting those recommendations done and done well, the robust staffing plan, the additional assessments, and addressing Low- hanging fruit makes sense.",54,,
544,0.97,3137.267,3143.24,"Given the limited amount of time that has passed since the report was issued, they don't appear to be any major challenges that will push this Timeline unnecessarily outward.",54,,
545,0.97,3143.24,3149.88,We are cautiously optimistic that this can be done by the end of 2023.,54,,
546,0.97,3149.88,3157.387,"In closing, I want to thank Sdot for their continued work on these recommendations and for providing information to us to follow-up independently on these items.",54,,
547,0.97,3157.387,3163.159,"Just to get back to our three Takeaways, Sdot is in the process of implementing our recommendations.",54,,
548,0.97,3163.159,3169.599,"Although the recommendations are not complete, where they are at in the process makes sense.",54,,
549,0.97,3169.599,3173.203,"From what we have seen, their efforts show that they are taking these recommendations very seriously.",54,,
550,0.97,3173.203,3176.306,Sdot committed to completing all 10 of these recommendations by 2023.,54,,
551,0.97,3176.306,3188.685,"They seem to be on track to get their if we have a little bit of cautious optimism about that one particular recommendation, that is why.",54,,
552,0.97,3188.685,3192.122,"Given the limited amount of time, we cannot say with certainty that the Timeline will be met.",54,,
553,0.97,3192.122,3194.724,Sdot needs to complete the planning work that it is currently engaged in.,54,,
554,0.97,3194.724,3203.9,We will have a lot more details in the Sdot presentation following ours.,54,,
555,0.97,3203.9,3204.501,"Thank you, Sean.",55,,
556,0.97,3204.501,3213.243,"I wanted to mention that we were joined earlier by committee member Lisa Herbold as well as Councilmember Lewis, because she is a cosponsor of the amendment.",55,,
557,0.97,3213.243,3218.248,I wanted to let everybody know that we are joined by additional Councilmembers.,55,,
558,0.97,3218.248,3218.782,Thank you.,55,,
559,0.97,3218.782,3223.153,Thank you to the city auditor's office for this update.,55,,
560,0.97,3223.153,3224.821,He will keep having you come back.,55,,
561,0.97,3224.821,3230.26,"Now, we will switch over to the Seattle Department of transportation.",55,,
562,0.97,3230.26,3235.432,And we will call on questions right now for the auditor.,55,,
563,0.97,3235.432,3236.633,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",55,,
564,0.97,3236.633,3239.869,Thank you.,56,,
565,0.97,3239.869,3252.148,I think it is less of an important question in more of an observation around the 2023 Deliverables and why that is so important.,56,,
566,0.97,3252.148,3260.223,"The recommendations, eight, nine, and 10 need to include cost estimates.",56,,
567,0.97,3260.223,3262.192,I understand that is a big body of work.,56,,
568,0.97,3262.192,3281.511,"We need to know when the funding is needed, what external sources could be attained with the total cost estimates, and the reason why the Timeline is so important is we need this information for informing the development of the next version of the move levy.",56,,
569,0.97,3281.511,3298.128,The 2015 move levy was developed without including as many funds for maintenance as the 2006 bridge and gap levy.,56,,
570,0.97,3298.128,3304.234,"Again, it is important to do this planning work so we don't Replicate what I think was a mistake in 2015.",56,,
571,0.97,3304.234,3316.246,"This levy runs through 2024, so planning for the next levy will begin in 2023, if not sooner.",56,,
572,0.97,3316.246,3337.367,"Given that the levy is the single largest long-term source of city transportation funds, if we want to fulfill the obligations under the city audit, we need a clear estimate of how much funding will be needed to maintain the bridges.",56,,
573,0.97,3337.367,3347.277,We do have some of that information as it relates specifically to the bridge levy retrofit project.,56,,
574,0.97,3347.277,3361.291,"For the 16 bridges in that program, the retrofit program, we know that the costs have increased from $67 Million- $730 million.",56,,
575,0.97,3361.291,3370.467,We need to do that same sort of analysis across a larger swath of bridgework.,56,,
576,0.97,3370.467,3380.477,"Actually, I do have one question for the auditor as it relates specifically to the ratings of good, fair, and poor.",56,,
577,0.97,3380.477,3391.988,"The auditor found, of 77 bridges, 22 were considered good, 50 were considered fair, and five were considered poor.",56,,
578,0.97,3391.988,3397.894,Is that rating system a rating system that the city auditor developed?,56,,
579,0.97,3397.894,3401.731,Or is it something that Sdot developed?,56,,
580,0.97,3401.731,3405.402,I am interested about what a fair rating is.,56,,
581,0.97,3405.402,3418.014,"The 4TH Avenue Southbridge over railroad tracks in Soto is rated fair, but the right Northbound Lane has been closed since, I believe, 2017.",56,,
582,0.97,3418.014,3423.353,I am trying to figure out how that would qualify for a fair rating under those circumstances.,56,,
583,0.97,3423.353,3424.521,Thank you.,56,,
584,0.97,3424.521,3428.958,Thank you for the question.,57,,
585,0.97,3428.958,3440.436,The rating system is actually from the Federal Government.,57,,
586,0.97,3440.436,3442.872,It is taking inventory data and looking at the conditions there.,57,,
587,0.97,3442.872,3452.715,"As you mentioned, three simple categories, poor, fair, and good.",57,,
588,0.97,3452.715,3455.051,We found in the data is there is more complexity in it.,57,,
589,0.97,3455.051,3459.489,"He gives you a rough picture, but it does not give you the most accurate one.",57,,
590,0.97,3459.489,3463.593,"The West Seattle bridge, I believe, was in fair condition.",57,,
591,0.97,3463.593,3471.301,"The I-35W bridge that collapsed in Minnesota back in 2007, that was also in fair condition, as well.",57,,
592,0.97,3471.301,3473.903,There are some Caveats with the data.,57,,
593,0.97,3473.903,3475.572,Thank you.,58,,
594,0.97,3475.572,3478.608,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",59,,
595,0.97,3478.608,3484.714,"Councilmember Lewis, I did not know if you had a question or not at this time.",59,,
596,0.97,3484.714,3485.315,Please.,59,,
597,0.97,3485.315,3490.587,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",60,,
598,0.97,3490.587,3502.398,"I just wanted to make a general comment, since we have the auditor's office here, and just take the opportunity to express my really profound appreciation for the contributions the office makes in the legislative branch.",60,,
599,0.97,3502.398,3510.707,We tend to forget as a city and a city government that the legislative branch is not just the city council.,60,,
600,0.97,3510.707,3535.431,"It includes this Award-Winning, highly professional, very the capable and accomplished group of professionals who help us accomplish the task of oversight of the executive departments.",60,,
601,0.97,3535.431,3539.536,"I wanted to take a moment to highlight that, since I have been doing a lot of work with the auditor's office.",60,,
602,0.97,3539.536,3541.771,I have a lot of respect for what they are doing.,60,,
603,0.97,3541.771,3544.841,This is a great example of how enhances the oversight function of the legislative Department.,60,,
604,0.97,3544.841,3546.843,"That is all I wanted to say, Councilmember Pedersen.",60,,
605,0.97,3546.843,3548.678,I will save my questions for the next agenda item.,60,,
606,0.97,3548.678,3549.979,"Thank you, Councilmember.",61,,
607,0.97,3549.979,3551.748,So we will move now to Sdot.,61,,
608,0.97,3551.748,3556.185,They can talk about the bridge program.,61,,
609,0.97,3556.185,3556.953,Thank you.,61,,
610,0.97,3556.953,3560.189,We have matt Donahue.,61,,
611,0.97,3560.189,3565.295,"And director Zimbabwe is standing by, as well.",61,,
612,0.97,3565.295,3569.399,I will give a couple of words of introduction.,62,,
613,0.97,3569.399,3571.267,Matt is going to lead us through this presentation.,62,,
614,0.97,3571.267,3579.776,Matt is our roadway structures division's director.,62,,
615,0.97,3579.776,3593.323,"We want to thank you for having this conversation and checking in on our status of response to the bridge audit, as well as be able to talk a little bit more about the bridge program and some of the complexity that goes into that.",62,,
616,0.97,3593.323,3601.898,"There are many, many dedicated people who have built their careers at Sdot taking care of our infrastructure and our riches.",62,,
617,0.97,3601.898,3615.111,"It is just that and I hear before you, but we stand on the shoulders of all those committed professionals who take care of our infrastructure each and every day.",62,,
618,0.97,3615.111,3615.945,This is a complicated topic.,62,,
619,0.97,3615.945,3626.656,"We have a commitment at Sdot to make investments to fix it right, to invest in our infrastructure in an ongoing, sustainable way.",62,,
620,0.97,3626.656,3653.983,"This does feed into not only the response to the audit from last year, which we were very appreciative of the Award- winning audit, but also the next item and how we build a sustainable program that is focused on maintenance of our assets over time in a long- term, sustainable way.",62,,
621,0.97,3653.983,3655.084,Matt is going to talk.,62,,
622,0.97,3655.084,3656.819,We have hurt a lot already this morning.,62,,
623,0.97,3656.819,3658.588,I know we are probably running a little behind schedule.,62,,
624,0.97,3658.588,3664.894,It was important to talk in a little bit more detail and flush out some of what it means to run a bridge program and how we approach that at Sdot.,62,,
625,0.97,3664.894,3673.403,I will turn it over to matt and look forward to questions.,62,,
626,0.97,3673.403,3674.003,"Thank you, Sam.",63,,
627,0.97,3674.003,3682.111,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen and Committee.",63,,
628,0.97,3682.111,3682.712,Good morning.,63,,
629,0.97,3682.712,3685.815,"For the record, my name is matt Donahue and I am the roadway structures division director.",63,,
630,0.97,3685.815,3689.419,Our agenda is to go over just briefly how this division is organized.,63,,
631,0.97,3689.419,3700.63,"Going through those introductory slides very quickly, we can get to the three main topics that we have been invited to discuss today.",63,,
632,0.97,3700.63,3701.23,"Next slide, please.",63,,
633,0.97,3701.23,3716.245,"So just a little bit about myself, I am a professional engineer licensed in the state of Washington and several other States in the region.",63,,
634,0.97,3716.245,3718.314,I have about 30 years of experience as an engineer.,63,,
635,0.97,3718.314,3724.887,"I have been fortunate to split my career between Geotech and structural engineering and design and construction, largely focused on asset management and seismic resiliency.",63,,
636,0.97,3724.887,3731.294,I am the federally designated bridge program manager for Sdot and a certified bridge inspector.,63,,
637,0.97,3731.294,3740.436,I have taught inspection courses for the national highway Institute . I am a commercial diver.,63,,
638,0.97,3740.436,3743.673,"Glancing at this slide, you might think this guy is really good at talking about himself.",63,,
639,0.97,3743.673,3749.445,I give this specific professional background just to demonstrate the type of talent that Seattle D.O.T.,63,,
640,0.97,3749.445,3751.147,Attracts.,63,,
641,0.97,3751.147,3756.486,It is a Department that is known nationwide.,63,,
642,0.97,3756.486,3765.027,"As Sam said, I am one of several hundred dedicated, talented transportation professionals who work for the D.O.T.",63,,
643,0.97,3765.027,3767.396,And the city every day of the week.,63,,

646,0.97,3786.983,3792.622,"So movable bridge operations group structural maintenance, and structural engineering.",63,,
647,0.97,3792.622,3795.024,"These three groups, there is a fourth group really, the leadership team.",63,,
648,0.97,3795.024,3809.372,"That is myself and the two managers whom I work with the most, a professional engineer and bridge inspector who has been with the city for about 15 years--he is the manager for mobile bridge ops and structural engineering.",63,,
649,0.97,3809.372,3814.61,Then Paul Jackson is a career maintenance professional who Úhas been with the city for Ove 23 years and leaves the structural maintenance team.,63,,
650,0.97,3814.61,3843.239,"With this division and that leadership, we handle several different types of bodies of work that ultimately roll out our mandate, which is to keep the traveling public safe in the city of Seattle as it relates to roadway structures.",63,,
651,0.97,3843.239,3846.876,"That includes operational maintenance of all of our asset types, which includes bridges and several other asset types.",63,,
652,0.97,3846.876,3852.782,"Capital programs provide subject matter expertise, responding to emergencies the leading our work with equity, and doing a fair amount of Reimbursable work throughout the city and the region.",63,,
653,0.97,3852.782,3868.397,This group is comprised of long Tenured staff over seven labor units that have dedicated their careers for the most part two maintaining structures for the city.,63,,

655,0.97,3873.302,3879.141,"To speak to that, the operator pictured on this slide is a licensed commercial vessel captain.",63,,
656,0.97,3879.141,3891.12,They operate our four city-owned bridges and a fifth at South Park that we operate for the county.,63,,
657,0.97,3891.12,3906.936,They are in an interesting nexus in our operation in that they work pretty closing with engineering and unit maintenance for these complex structures that are a movable facility that has complicated mechanical and electronic components so we can operate safely.,63,,
658,0.97,3906.936,3910.84,Next slide?,63,,
659,0.97,3910.84,3941.871,"Our structural maintenance group, there are five specific job types generally speaking, electricians, mechanics, carpenters we call them bridge carpentry maintenance leads, which is a heavy, civil type carpenter--and they are responsible for Preventative maintenance as well as major rehabilitation and some capital replacement within allowable limits for the overall costs of those projects.",63,,
660,0.97,3941.871,3943.973,Next slide?,63,,
661,0.97,3943.973,3968.965,"Our structural engineering group or bridge inspectors our engineers and engineering specialists who focus on inspection of all of our structures, not just the bridge, we do specialized work for bridge inspection, as well, which involves critical and movable structure inspections, which are stipulated by the National inspection standards that were mentioned earlier.",63,,
662,0.97,3968.965,3973.202,We bring in contractors who supervise underwater work.,63,,
663,0.97,3973.202,3983.713,"We look at all of our asset types, stairways, railways, retaining walls, and miscellaneous structures in our inventory.",63,,
664,0.97,3983.713,3990.686,That group does repair design and works with other programs to build new assets that we bring into our inventory.,63,,
665,0.97,3990.686,4000.396,"We also work with other Stakeholder groups, sound transit for instance, to protect our existing assets as it relates to their operations.",63,,
666,0.97,4000.396,4002.631,Next slide?,63,,
667,0.97,4002.631,4010.806,The assets that we maintain our valued at $8.3 billion.,63,,
668,0.97,4010.806,4014.643,"For the most part, they cover bridges, retaining walls, stairways, and area ways.",63,,
669,0.97,4014.643,4022.752,"On average, at the auditor was speaking of earlier, our annual maintenance budget is about $6.6 million.",63,,
670,0.97,4022.752,4029.458,"The movable bridge operations group Nonreimbursable for our own bridges, is around $4 million.",63,,
671,0.97,4029.458,4031.26,Next slide?,63,,

695,0.97,4236.298,4241.971,This is a particular interest of mine given my background.,63,,
696,0.97,4241.971,4243.372,This is currently a levy program.,63,,
697,0.97,4243.372,4258.821,It is largely guided by our own Homegrown policy document on how to conduct analysis and retrofit of existing structures it started with 16 bridges in 2016.,63,,
698,0.97,4258.821,4268.764,"By the time we got through the concept definition report phase, which was completed for all 16 bridges last year, this indicated higher costs than anticipated.",63,,
699,0.97,4268.764,4284.813,"Largely the way to describe that change in costs versus what was anticipated in 2015 or 2016 is that we had to do the work, the Cdr work, to define what those costs are.",63,,
700,0.97,4284.813,4286.215,I did not come to the D.O.T.,63,,
701,0.97,4286.215,4292.121,Until 2017 and was not in charge of roadway structures until 2018.,63,,
702,0.97,4292.121,4303.966,"The way I understand it, the costs were based on the number of bridges and size of each bridge as compared to the size to do previous bridges in the program.",63,,
703,0.97,4303.966,4315.911,This current program is phase 3 . There were two previous phases that were done before the current levy.,63,,
704,0.97,4315.911,4325.454,"I think the costs that were associated with those projects were for a different type of approach for seismic retrofit, having worked in seismic analysis or design for the last 20 years.",63,,
705,0.97,4325.454,4332.561,"Particularly in the Pacific Northwest, the pace at which the standard of practice has changed has been very rapid.",63,,
706,0.97,4332.561,4346.542,"For instance, the current version of our seismic retrofit policy manual came Online in 2015 as the levy was launching.",63,,
707,0.97,4346.542,4351.847,I think the situation develops where we needed to do the detailed analysis work in the Cdr phase to understand what the true costs are.,63,,
708,0.97,4351.847,4356.051,Those large costs were predominantly due to the?,63,,
709,0.97,4356.051,4363.192,Viable soils and the high cost that is all is always associated with foundation or surface retrofit.,63,,
710,0.97,4363.192,4369.865,Our current deliverable is retrofit of 11 bridges instead of the original 16.,63,,

713,0.97,4378.207,4381.51,We have many asset types that we take care of.,63,,
714,0.97,4381.51,4384.713,It is driven by our maintenance and inspection program.,63,,
715,0.97,4384.713,4397.726,"As you know from reading the Award-Winning report delivered by the office of city auditor, the average age of our bridges is in the neighborhood of 60 years old, with many older than that.",63,,
716,0.97,4397.726,4404.433,It drives the division in that really it requires coordination between all of our groups.,63,,
717,0.97,4404.433,4421.917,We conduct our work in this area as stipulated by the National bridge inspection standards under 23 CFR 650. the drawbridge operations regulation is administered under the Coast guard.,63,,

719,0.97,4430.659,4441.17,It depends on the configuration of a particular bridge.,63,,
720,0.97,4441.17,4450.479,"In response to the audit, we have tried to frame this in a way that is strategic and combines work for a particular type of audit recommendations where it makes sense.",63,,
721,0.97,4450.479,4461.223,"Generally speaking, you can say that we are looking to make a strategic trip from an asset maintenance project list to a Proactive asset preservation Workplan.",63,,
722,0.97,4461.223,4468.197,"But I have laid out here, we call business practices upgrade priorities can which you see numbered on the left.",63,,
723,0.97,4468.197,4478.607,"Just to give a general description of what those are, and then we will show which office of city auditor recommendation they correspond to.",63,,
724,0.97,4478.607,4483.879,That is either individually or when we thought it made sense to combine them.,63,,
725,0.97,4483.879,4502.931,To speak to the priorities it is a combination of precedents--certain things needed to happen first before another body of work could have been--and bodies of work in the audit recommendations or priorities that were smaller Orchid Standoffs on their own and be done quickly.,63,,

729,0.97,4532.261,4564.092,"We are trying to do as much work in 2021 with writing the script in terms of scope, schedule, and fee in terms of how we will adopt and implement all of these recommendations, continuing that through 2022 with being prepared for our formal Wsdot and Fhwa audit and adopting these recommendations and business practice upgrades through 2022 and 2023 until we get the full completion.",63,,

733,0.97,4578.707,4589.551,"What we consider in terms of how we do that work, we recommend a structure for replacement or, as we have seen recently, partial or full closure.",63,,
734,0.97,4589.551,4597.426,We really believe that investment in the region bridges must be planned Proactively.,63,,
735,0.97,4597.426,4606.034,"When I look at these business practices upgrades and how I have thought about what direction to move the division and since I came on board in 2018, this is not rocket science.",63,,

738,0.97,4612.24,4630.759,We know how things need to change given where we are at and the deterioration curve for all of our assets.,63,,
739,0.97,4630.759,4632.961,I think most of the country is in the same position.,63,,
740,0.97,4632.961,4635.564,There is a lot of national discussion about how to handle this.,63,,
741,0.97,4635.564,4638.033,We have a pretty good idea of what we want to do.,63,,
742,0.97,4638.033,4641.069,We need to define specifically how we are going to do it and make it happen.,63,,
743,0.97,4641.069,4648.176,"To that end, even though we are early in the process, we are on track to meet our commitments to respond to both the Wsdot and Fhwa audit by 2023.",63,,

745,0.97,4651.446,4657.152,Thank you very much for everything you do for our city and the overview of the group.,64,,
746,0.97,4657.152,4682.31,"Also, I wanted to speak to something--I appreciate Councilmember Herbold raising this earlier--wanting to hear more about the seismic upgrade needs . The audit was focused on bridge and maintenance Backlogs and physical condition . The seismic upgrade is more of a bigger capital improvement need.",64,,
747,0.97,4682.31,4690.018,There was a change in how you were deciding how to allocate those dollars.,64,,
748,0.97,4690.018,4692.487,Costs have gone up.,64,,
749,0.97,4692.487,4704.433,You decided to focus in on specific bridges that had the greatest need.,64,,
750,0.97,4704.433,4708.336,Could you talk a little bit about the difference between the seismic upgrade needs and the changes that have occurred?,64,,
751,0.97,4708.336,4710.539,And also explain why the costs have gone up so much.,64,,
752,0.97,4710.539,4725.353,I know a lot of people are scratching their heads about why the cost estimates were number and shot up to a much larger number later.,64,,
753,0.97,4725.353,4726.888,There are a number of factors.,65,,
754,0.97,4726.888,4736.364,"As I mentioned earlier, the pace at which the standard of practice for what people consider to be responsible policy for retrofitting structures has changed pretty drastically over the last 20 years and maybe even more so over the last 10.",65,,
755,0.97,4736.364,4742.437,It has to do with the performance standards that we design Retrofits to.,65,,
756,0.97,4742.437,4756.451,"We say we want a bridge to remain operational, which means usable with minor repairs, after a 100 year level event earthquake.",65,,
757,0.97,4756.451,4772.067,"We want the bridge to maybe not be usable, but not collapse at 1000 year level earthquake, so that would be typically thought of as a 9.0 event on the Cascadia Subduction zone.",65,,
758,0.97,4772.067,4777.806,"Using those specific performances, that is pretty demanding.",65,,
759,0.97,4777.806,4783.278,"You are asking a structure to do a lot, particularly if it is an older, aging structure.",65,,
760,0.97,4783.278,4805.233,"As we move forward with our seismic retrofit program, we will have to get into these sticky wicket conversations where we determine significantly high cost for seismic retrofit and balance that cost against if we should just push for a replacement.",65,,
761,0.97,4805.233,4813.642,"The seismic standards are also 100 year for operations and B,1000 for collapse prevention.",65,,
762,0.97,4813.642,4824.92,"I think the Department, the region, the professional state of practice for seismic retrofit was at a point of transition right around the time the levy was launching.",65,,
763,0.97,4824.92,4832.227,"They could not have predicted, they did not have any basis with which to predict how those costs are going to increase.",65,,
764,0.97,4832.227,4843.572,We had to get into the program and do that first concept definition report design phase or analysis phase to determine the true costs.,65,,
765,0.97,4843.572,4845.44,That face is very detailed.,65,,
766,0.97,4845.44,4864.893,"Most programs are split into three phases, the Cdr designing the retrofit strategies that you adopt and then constructing them . that Cdr phase can you do an analysis of the structure as is and then develop atrophic strategies to keep those things from breaking.",65,,
767,0.97,4864.893,4870.565,"It is fairly mathematically, a Nonlinear model intensive.",65,,
768,0.97,4870.565,4873.468,Okay.,66,,
769,0.97,4873.468,4879.841,Thank you for explaining the differences between ongoing repair and maintenance needs and the seismic upgrade needs.,66,,
770,0.97,4879.841,4902.03,"Also, the seismic upgrade standards have increased, which then increases cost . I also understand that you may have gotten more information about the bridges, as well, just like for any project.",66,,
771,0.97,4902.03,4908.403,"If you get to 30% design, then 50% design, etc., you are getting more information and find out costs were higher for those seismic upgrades.",66,,
772,0.97,4908.403,4909.004,Is that accurate?,66,,
773,0.97,4909.004,4919.347,"That is a fair analogy but it is also an affectation of the geographical environment that we have here, because of how the city was built or how the region develops.",67,,
774,0.97,4919.347,4926.655,We have a high incident potential for Liquefying soil.,67,,
775,0.97,4926.655,4944.706,"When you are dealing with Liquefaction and retrofit of foundations, your costs get high very, very quickly, as opposed to retrofitting modifications that you have to do a do eight bridge above ground.",67,,
776,0.97,4944.706,4946.775,It is a lot easier to do that above ground work.,67,,
777,0.97,4946.775,4948.576,Thank you.,68,,
778,0.97,4948.576,4959.454,"Councilmembers, any questions for matt Donahue or Sam Zimbabwe? I think the auditor is still here, as well.",68,,

788,0.97,5031.96,5039.467,"Colleagues, our city council approved a $20 vehicle license fee as part of our fall budget process.",71,,
789,0.97,5039.467,5052.847,A majority of Councilmembers asked Sdot to establish a Stakeholder process for spending those funds.,71,,
790,0.97,5052.847,5054.048,Is about $7.2 million per year.,71,,
791,0.97,5054.048,5058.253,I want to thank everybody at Sdot for doing that work and everybody who participated in that process.,71,,
792,0.97,5058.253,5076.471,"Even with a proposal to issue $100 million in bonds, the suggestions from the sake of the process can inform the investment of tens of millions of dollars and potentially get that money out the door quicker.",71,,
793,0.97,5076.471,5078.406,There are things to talk about with that proposal.,71,,
794,0.97,5078.406,5089.184,"Let's hear from you, we have our essential staff transportation expert, Calvin chow here, before we hear from Sdot on their original proposal on spending this.",71,,
795,0.97,5089.184,5089.684,Opening remarks?,71,,
796,0.97,5089.684,5093.621,I appreciate it the memo you provided to us.,71,,
797,0.97,5093.621,5097.926,I think the SI presentation gets to the heart of it.,72,,
798,0.97,5097.926,5099.527,I will hold on comments for now.,72,,
799,0.97,5099.527,5101.93,"Sdot, take it away again.",73,,
800,0.97,5101.93,5112.74,"Connect you can hear from you again before I turn it over to my capable colleagues, Kyle Butler and Annya Pintak.",73,,
801,0.97,5112.74,5125.553,I think this is a good sequence of transition from the conversation about our ridges to the work that we did in engaging with Stakeholders and coming up with a spend plan for this $20 vehicle license fee.,73,,
802,0.97,5125.553,5134.562,"This presentation was developed before the proposal, so it does not speak directly to the proposed amendment.",73,,
803,0.97,5134.562,5138.766,We are very happy to answer questions.,73,,
804,0.97,5138.766,5150.178,"When we were asked to do the Stakeholder outreach and engagement by the Council, we were excited about this new $20 vehicle license fee.",73,,
805,0.97,5150.178,5163.091,We felt like it would enable us Úto invest more resources in maintenance across the broad portfolio of assets that we take care of.,73,,
806,0.97,5163.091,5171.199,Maintenance is one of the most difficult types of funding to secure for transportation.,73,,
807,0.97,5171.199,5193.588,"The ongoing, sustainable investment Year-Over-Year, consistent amounts that we can budget against and staff against, you heard about from the city auditor one of those top recommendations mean to increase our staffing related to bridge asset planning, investment, asset management.",73,,

809,0.97,5207.202,5211.439,We designed this proposal to deliver this result quickly.,73,,
810,0.97,5211.439,5218.613,"This is money that is new to us, $7.5 million on an ongoing basis.",73,,
811,0.97,5218.613,5229.457,The design proposal that we go through is intended to get that money into projects that people can see results across the city quickly.,73,,
812,0.97,5229.457,5233.161,This isn't developing a large capital project.,73,,
813,0.97,5233.161,5242.737,It can often take years to develop and see results on the ground.,73,,
814,0.97,5242.737,5247.141,This is trying to get regular maintenance out the door extremely quickly in a way that people can see in their communities.,73,,
815,0.97,5247.141,5254.949,"Kyle Butler, was with an Finance and administration division, is here with me.",73,,
816,0.97,5254.949,5261.389,"He is focused on and has been really meeting the process here, focused on revenue development and some of our overall revenue needs.",73,,
817,0.97,5261.389,5268.496,Annya Pintak manages our equity program and has been crucial for the engagement efforts that we have done.,73,,
818,0.97,5268.496,5271.599,We can move forward to the next slide.,73,,
819,0.97,5271.599,5287.215,"Our work here in developing this is grounded in our mission, vision, and core values that Seattle is a thriving equitable community powered by transportation.",73,,
820,0.97,5287.215,5292.92,That is no matter how you get around the city and our mission to deliver affordable and safe access to places and opportunities.,73,,
821,0.97,5292.92,5295.323,"We heard about that in the public comment, as well.",73,,
822,0.97,5295.323,5309.971,"Six core values drive our work: equity and really dressing some of the equity issues, safety, mobility, Sustainability, livability, and excellence.",73,,
823,0.97,5326.888,5351.779,"In November, just about as soon as the budget was adopted, we had an initial meeting with Stakeholders, I would say the start of the process of the beginning was really, how can we take the new revenue source, the intended purpose of our assets and best deploy looking across our needs at all of the things we take care of.",73,,
824,0.97,5351.779,5367.695,"We met with Stakeholders on some of those asset starting in February, really trying to Grandma in the overall budget picture for Sdot and budget needs in the first few months.",73,,
825,0.97,5367.695,5393.588,"We took feedback on the broad priority setting, we came back in March with the second briefing for Stakeholders, for sharing a proposed spending plan and trying to hear how and if we were able to incorporate what we heard in the first feedback section back in that session I participated in all four of the Stakeholder briefings personally.",73,,
826,0.97,5393.588,5409.237,"We submitted our spend plan, we are ready to get to work, as soon as we can get the spending plan adopted, we start to collect revenue in July.",73,,
827,0.97,5409.237,5420.648,We can forecast that revenue and we can start to work and invest as soon as the spending plan and budget are set.,73,,
828,0.97,5420.648,5441.269,"Beyond, we can forecast against the existing $20 Vlf and the core foundation of what we do as a Department and it provides reliable, dependable resource that we program in an ongoing way for these sorts of investments.",73,,
829,0.97,5441.269,5451.479,"So really, really focused on the initial part of the spend plan, but sets the stage for a long term sustainable investment that we see as being really critical in taking care of all of our assets.",73,,
830,0.97,5451.479,5457.785,With that I will turn it over to Anya to talk more on the Stakeholder process.,73,,
831,0.97,5457.785,5468.696,"Great, thanks so much, Sam, good morning, as Sam mentioned, my name is Anya Pintack, I am an equity program manager for Sdot.",74,,
832,0.97,5468.696,5471.299,I will talk about the Stakeholder outreach process.,74,,
833,0.97,5471.299,5475.036,As part of the process we heard from the following Stakeholders that you see on the presentation here.,74,,
834,0.97,5475.036,5486.18,We had a diverse range of Stakeholders to represent transportation and labor representatives who are able to share with us the transportation needs and values.,74,,
835,0.97,5486.18,5499.66,"Partners and representatives here consider all modes of transportation, as well as sharing with different ages and abilities on how folks rely on them.",74,,
836,0.97,5499.66,5510.338,"As part of this process and I will mention we did this virtually given Covid, as part of the process we separated Stakeholders into two groups.",74,,
837,0.97,5510.338,5521.015,The first Stakeholder really were very familiar with Sdot and our line of dismisses and are typically engaged in the public forum in some capacity.,74,,
838,0.97,5521.015,5533.728,"Our other group, this is a focus representative and we invited community members to participate in the Stakeholder group.",74,,
839,0.97,5533.728,5549.277,"I want to mention, in that group, a lot of the organizations were not familiar with Sdot, it might have been the first time engaging in this capacity as well as a public forum in this matter and a process like this.",74,,
840,0.97,5549.277,5560.688,"And so, we met with those Stakeholder groups twice as Sam mentioned, once in February and in March, we had a total of four meetings.",74,,
841,0.97,5560.688,5563.991,Within the list of representatives from the organization here attended at least one of the meetings.,74,,
842,0.97,5563.991,5567.395,Let me go to the next slide.,74,,
843,0.97,5567.395,5600.828,"So, I wanted to give more context in terms of the Stakeholder session, as my role within this program as a program manager, I work very closely and in the lead staff with the equity Workgroup members which is our group of community members who have been Codeveloping with our Department for almost the past three years on her Trans station equity framework, you heard from one of the members during the public comment.",74,,
844,0.97,5600.828,5611.939,"Really, one of the key equity values that we have heard very clearly from our equity Workgroup is that a fundamental piece of achieving Trans station equity is community engagement.",74,,
845,0.97,5611.939,5622.483,Really this process allowed us to provide an opportunity to engage with those typically Underrepresented in public forum.,74,,
846,0.97,5622.483,5630.091,This is an opportunity to build a Holistic relationship and not just a Transactional way of communicating.,74,,
847,0.97,5630.091,5649.944,"So we are aligned with everyone and as well as the greater commitment to engagement and outreach practices, particularly with communities that are traditionally excluded from the public engagement process and decision-making process as well.",74,,
848,0.97,5649.944,5660.988,This picture here I should clarify is a couple of our Trans station workers and this was Pre-Covid when we met in person a few years ago.,74,,
849,0.97,5660.988,5672.199,"I wanted to just mention that within the Stakeholder process, especially with community organizations serving those communities, we held this meeting separately to allow space for conversation within smaller groups.",74,,
850,0.97,5672.199,5677.571,It is important that we facilitate in a space where folks felt comfortable.,74,,
851,0.97,5677.571,5687.348,"I will say it was a good learning opportunity allowing us to engage and align businesses, especially with those that might not be familiar.",74,,
852,0.97,5687.348,5694.889,What we heard is that folks felt heard through this process.,74,,
853,0.97,5694.889,5703.564,I want to just say that this is the first step for us to think and invite and engage folks to be part of this civic engagement process.,74,,
854,0.97,5703.564,5707.501,We can go to the next slide.,74,,
855,0.97,5707.501,5713.607,We heard several priorities to the spend plan and this Depicts some key topics that we heard.,74,,
856,0.97,5713.607,5728.923,"The larger text indicates priorities we have heard several times, such as safety, climate change, equity, maintenance and Streetlights.",74,,
857,0.97,5728.923,5734.161,As you can see there were other topics that came but we really wanted to highlight the key priorities that came out of the Stakeholder process.,74,,
858,0.97,5734.161,5737.665,With that I will turn it over to Kyle Butler.,74,,
859,0.97,5737.665,5752.747,"Good morning Councilmembers, I am Kyle Butler, I financial advisor at Sdot and I will talk about how this came together with the elements that we are recommending today.",75,,
860,0.97,5752.747,5767.761,"In February, we end with asking the Stakeholder groups to vote on how to look at the seven evaluation categories you see on the slide that are grounded in the values as a department.",75,,
861,0.97,5767.761,5779.373,"Then, we get their vote to convey which priorities they would like to see us use as we score this potential program.",75,,
862,0.97,5779.373,5803.397,"We took three groups, had the opportunity to vote and a Subset of Sdot staff members, modal and labor, and equity Stakeholders, the Sdot staff and label Stakeholders made up 25% of the final score and we waited the equity Stakeholders with 50% of the score.",75,,
863,0.97,5803.397,5814.308,"We combine those results to deliver the outcome row across the bottom, the darker shades represent higher priority from those votes.",75,,
864,0.97,5814.308,5824.251,The bottom row shows the top things that came out of the conversation in the votes were in line with what we heard in the conversation.,75,,
865,0.97,5824.251,5834.862,"They were equity, safety, maintenance and climate change, those were the biggest drivers of our scoring and how we reviewed that for programs.",75,,
866,0.97,5834.862,5848.075,Then we took that and went back and developed a spend plan proposal and came back to those groups in March to share this plan with them.,75,,
867,0.97,5848.075,5873.4,"We turned to that feedback into a Values-Based action plan and like I mentioned, we heard a lot of interest in making sure the plan is equitable and Prioritizes safety, maintenance and meets climate change goals, we heard a lot of interest making sure that it supports jobs and we feel this work does do that.",75,,
868,0.97,5873.4,5888.916,"We considered the budget impacts of the pandemic and the resulting recession and our need to maintain and improve infrastructure, citywide transportation goals, levy commitments and more.",75,,
869,0.97,5888.916,5902.296,"We also distributed a brief Online survey on the proposed plan and got feedback from over 400 people Online, all of that went into developing a spend plan that will go into each element starting with that next slide.",75,,
870,0.97,5902.296,5911.839,Safe streets was one of our biggest categories in our funding and spending plan.,75,,
871,0.97,5911.839,5951.912,"That was a big seam here in outreach and the safe streets focus area accounts for 28% of the proposed funding, responding to investments in the streets and communities experiencing most of Seattle's Sirius crashes in vision corridors, this would go towards the vision zero program which is grounded in equity and data analysis, we use data to determine the focus areas, those are streets and intersections with the most fatal and serious injury crashes and those locations often overlap with communities of color and vulnerable populations.",75,,
872,0.97,5951.912,5963.657,Early programs in Clued Martin Luther Junior King way and airport way South and Aurora Avenue.,75,,
873,0.97,5963.657,5973.801,We look at the source of funding as a potential source for some key elements of stay healthy streets.,75,,
874,0.97,5973.801,5978.005,Ready for the next slide.,75,,
875,0.97,5978.005,5993.053,"Okay, safe sidewalks, so, we also heard a strong interest in better serving pedestrians and watching transit access with Walkable neighborhoods and helping me climate change goals.",75,,
876,0.97,5993.053,6020.447,"This category also makes up 28% of proposed funding and could enable us to do a lot of maintenance work, Rick race, replacing BEACONS and repairing sidewalks especially where trees have done damage and installing more Ada curb ramps.",75,,
877,0.97,6020.447,6031.392,"Using the sidewalk assessment data, we will look at which repairs would provide the highest value for improvements in safety and mobility at the lowest cost, we can also be really targeted in making sure we are addressing communities that have been historically Underserved.",75,,
878,0.97,6031.392,6042.202,"Kyle, on the sidewalks, would that be new sidewalks or would it just be repairing existing ones?",76,,
879,0.97,6042.202,6044.471,The majority of this is repairing existing sidewalks.,77,,
880,0.97,6044.471,6051.478,The new construction in this safe sidewalk focus area would be related to new curb ramps.,77,,
881,0.97,6051.478,6067.795,"This is maintaining what we already have, things like sidewalk uplift from trip hazards that come from street trees, that kind of thing.",77,,
882,0.97,6067.795,6074.368,"We heard a lot of interest in the community groups about that, especially for our Elders citizens who have trouble in the risk of tripping over sidewalks, that kind of thing.",77,,
883,0.97,6074.368,6083.31,We sought is a big benefit to this maintenance effort.,77,,
884,0.97,6083.31,6088.615,"With $2 million, how many curb ramps could you do approximately, that is something you can get back to us on.",78,,
885,0.97,6088.615,6096.99,"Yeah, I can get that data to you, the full $2 million is not curb ramps, that is only a percentage, we can follow up with that.",79,,
886,0.97,6096.99,6099.193,"Okay, thank you.",80,,
887,0.97,6099.193,6113.941,"Strong bridges and structures is our next biggest area in the proposed plan, it represents 24% of the spending plan and it was a big high priority that we heard about in the outreach.",81,,
888,0.97,6113.941,6136.663,"With this funding we would make Proactive investments to reduce the maintenance backlog and extend service like bridges and maintains serve, surface and would promote rehabilitation of bridges, stairs and underground area ways.",81,,
889,0.97,6136.663,6165.158,"So, spending in the first few years would be focused on a few early priorities, a lot of these are focused on movable bridge components with systems like matt showed, there are many different, electrical, Hydraulic, the all go into them and this could help maintain those for Spokane s swing bridge, University bridge, Fremont bridge, and evaluating the Ballard bridge as well.",81,,
890,0.97,6165.158,6177.838,There would also be the Spokane Viaduct and the deck rehabilitation and then improvements on the Jose Rizal bridge allowing for better inspection access.,81,,
891,0.97,6177.838,6187.414,"That is a key part of us maintaining the structure, being able to access it properly for maintenance.",81,,
892,0.97,6187.414,6204.431,"Kyle, I thought the movable bridges would cost 8 million up to $10 million for those components to be replaced or installed?",82,,
893,0.97,6204.431,6220.013,"Sure, this would start the process, it does not fully fund all of that, but over the time we would be able to develop the plan and fix the most critical needs first and the funding, since it is ongoing would allow matt and his team to develop a plan to do that.",83,,
894,0.97,6220.013,6225.519,Thank you.,84,,
895,0.97,6225.519,6235.095,"Next, we invest 10% of the plan into active transportation maintenance or into bicycle infrastructure.",85,,
896,0.97,6235.095,6241.668,It is a key part of the investment to address climate change and climate change was an interest area we heard in the outreach.,85,,
897,0.97,6241.668,6258.652,"With this funding, we can repaint bicycle lanes, clear them of debris so a dedicated sweeping program enhancing the existing sweeping program.",85,,
898,0.97,6258.652,6262.99,"Install and maintain protective barriers between people driving and Biking, and improve and maintain bicycle signals.",85,,
899,0.97,6262.99,6280.307,"More people are trying Biking during the pandemic and we feel given the higher rates of bicycle ownership, keeping our facilities Well-Maintained is going to help promote climate friendly commuting choices.",85,,
900,0.97,6280.307,6287.014,"Also, with the work of the Seattle levy, the bike network is growing fast and maintenance needs will grow for that.",85,,
901,0.97,6287.014,6304.531,"Kyle, do we know how much it would cost to refurbish all of the existing bike lanes to get them back up, to repaint them, to stabilize anything that is broke, fix anything broken, total cost?",86,,
902,0.97,6304.531,6326.219,"I would have to get back to you on a total cost, this request was sized with that kind of level of service in mind of painting our existing liens and keeping existing barriers such as Candlestick barriers, that kind of thing, replaced and maintained, that was the intent behind this.",87,,
903,0.97,6326.219,6329.256,Thank you.,88,,
904,0.97,6329.256,6352.379,"Planning ahead, we would like to also propose investments in planning for future transportation systems and making sure that engaging communities is a big part of that planning to address our goals for equity, safety and Sustainability, including climate change as well.",89,,
905,0.97,6352.379,6375.402,"This represents 7% of the spending plan, I should mention in future years we are proposing 3% Set-Aside for reserves to Mange their future needs and for 2021, this is 7% of the funding going towards planning.",89,,
906,0.97,6375.402,6406.133,"We would like to use this funding to make sure that as we work towards the next citywide Multimodal planning that we can create a fully integrated transportation plan to also invest in really robust community engagement, especially with different communities and historically Underrepresented communities, bringing them in as a voice at the table.",89,,
907,0.97,6406.133,6413.306,I would like to invite Anya to comment on this as well.,89,,
908,0.97,6413.306,6414.941,"Yes, thanks so much for that, Kyle.",90,,
909,0.97,6414.941,6422.115,I will add on to what Kyle mentioned and say this is very aligned with the recommendations that we heard from the transportation equity Workgroup.,90,,
910,0.97,6422.115,6428.021,"Community engagement needs to start from the planning process, many times when planning starts decisions have been made.",90,,
911,0.97,6428.021,6439.232,"Again, this is back to this idea of starting the long-term learning process and inviting and engaging folks that were not traditionally involved to be part of that.",90,,
912,0.97,6439.232,6445.639,It is very aligned with the recommendations.,90,,
913,0.97,6445.639,6446.373,"Thanks, Anya.",91,,
914,0.97,6446.373,6506.333,"Thank you, we heard a lot of people talking today and we had a lot of Emails about a $3 million plan, but I think that was mainly on additional transit stations within the city of Seattle, so that is $3 million, this is only $500,000 per year, but I think what you were talking about is sort of Synthesizing the various mobile plans that we have and doing deeper outreach to communities that traditionally have not been consulted, I am curious how much both of those things would cost, there is the $3 million plus there is what you are talking about and Synthesizing modal plans to other communities that have not been engaged, do we know how much the total is so that we could be ready for 2023.",92,,
915,0.97,6507.901,6511.938,"I can jump in their little bit, we are still Scoping out what that future planning effort will look like.",93,,
916,0.97,6511.938,6514.641,Also what the cost is.,93,,
917,0.97,6514.641,6555.048,"Our transit master plan is the most out of date and this was done before St3 and there is an opportunity to think deeply about our future transit and as we build out St3 and the projects in the levy that is moving towards construction and Multimodal core doors, I don't think, I think this scaled within the context of all of our asset needs represented in this package, gets us there.",93,,
918,0.97,6555.048,6563.857,We are still in the process of Scoping out exactly what that engagement and analysis is to integrate a Multimodal plan.,93,,
919,0.97,6563.857,6570.096,Councilmember Tammy Morales?,94,,
920,0.97,6570.096,6599.125,"Thank you, I will have questions further down, but I do want to just thank the departments, thank you, on you for doing this work and for raising the issue of the need to think about how you do community engagement, as a planner, that is what we do, if you are hearing from community, what they feel their neighborhoods should look like.",95,,
921,0.97,6599.125,6623.35,"So, I just want to say thank you, I think if we are talking about equity, safety, mobility is some of those values the Department operates under, this is a really good example of how you are implementing those values and I really appreciate this.",95,,
922,0.97,6623.35,6626.92,Thank you.,96,,
923,0.97,6626.92,6627.32,Please continue.,96,,
924,0.97,6627.32,6662.088,"This is how the pieces fit together, as you can see, the safe streets, safe sidewalks, each a 28%, strong bridges and structures come in at 24%, active transportation 10%, planning ahead 7% and then a place for reserves and making sure we can deliver if we had a future revenue loss for something like a pandemic.",97,,
925,0.97,6662.088,6674.1,"Ultimately, we fill the program focuses on equity, including neighborhoods that face higher risk and lower devalued opportunities.",97,,
926,0.97,6674.1,6693.586,"Maintenance to help decrease backlog, climate change benefits to include the traveling experience for Walkers, bikers, and transit and planning for a healthier equitable future where things are needed most geographically.",97,,
927,0.97,6693.586,6711.037,Our spending plan that you are seeing in the ordinance today is for 2021 and it is constructed in a way that could be there for full 12 months worth of revenue.,97,,
928,0.97,6711.037,6717.01,Ready for the next slide.,97,,
929,0.97,6717.01,6731.458,"So, these programs proposed here, we found that they had overlapping benefits to those key areas with community, equity, safety, maintenance and climate change.",97,,
930,0.97,6731.458,6740.033,Each of these programs is designed to have benefits in multiple categories.,97,,
931,0.97,6740.033,6755.081,About 75% of this proposed spending plan would be dedicated to investments in neighborhoods in the darker color or darker yellow here.,97,,
932,0.97,6755.081,6770.463,This would be able to be directed to those neighborhoods with a higher risk of displacement and lower risk of displacement or opportunities rather.,97,,
933,0.97,6770.463,6781.207,"There is things that could fall outside of those, recognizing things like bridges with fixed locations that are part of the priorities in the span and spend plan.",97,,
934,0.97,6781.207,6836.129,"So, following the overlapping theme, asset maintenance has cross modal benefits that we thought were a great way to spend the money with paving streets that can be used to bike transit and freight as an example, in this case we are not paving the streets, we are keeping those facilities safe through maintenance is a big priority here and a lot of this is directed towards maintenance and those maintenance dollars, for every dollar spent now, that does save costs in the future, about six dollars up to $10 in rehabilitation costs.",97,,
935,0.97,6836.129,6865.491,"This supports jobs doing maintenance work . This slide breaks down by category how much of the work is maintenance, strong bridges and structures, that would be dedicated to maintenance and the lighter shade represents Ada ramp work.",97,,
936,0.97,6865.491,6889.616,The active transportation is all about maintaining those and this work is about 25% maintenance as it is often needed to improve a facility that has degraded and has not been properly maintained but if it was would improve the safety of the facility.,97,,
937,0.97,6889.616,6897.557,"In the rest of this plan in safe streets, is for new improvements.",97,,
938,0.97,6897.557,6905.031,Things like improved crossings and signals.,97,,
939,0.97,6905.031,6933.826,And then the sidewalk improvements and then planning ahead and giving ourselves the times two priority and maintain those resources.,97,,
940,0.97,6933.826,6953.112,We are excited about the resources we got and I will give you a few moments to read these Stakeholder comments.,97,,
941,0.97,6959.919,6985.611,"Thanks, bill we've heard from a couple other people today next Upstart with counsel discussion of the spend plan proposal and your Timeline for finalizing that spend plan in May.",97,,
942,0.97,6985.611,7012.238,"Revenue collection of the $20 vehicle license fee would begin in July and this summer, as soon as it is approved, we will continue to engage and have other opportunities to fund.",97,,
943,0.97,7012.238,7039.465,"Councilmembers, any questions for the space plan that is presented by Sdot? I am happy to launch into a discussion on the amendments, we have Councilmember Lisa Herbold and Councilmember Lewis here if anyone else wants to sign on as a cosponsor, this is a good time to do it during this discussion as well.",98,,
944,0.97,7039.465,7043.736,"Yes, Councilmember Tammy Morales?",98,,
945,0.97,7043.736,7088.114,"I apologize for not marking the slide number but you do have a slight where you say that 75% of the Vlf revenue would be intended for particular parts of the town based on equity there, thank you, can you talk a little bit about how you got to this decision, how you make decisions, both, I understand in terms of why these areas, North Seattle, South Seattle are areas that have been De- invested in for generations, how do you get to the 75% allocation for those parts of town?",99,,
946,0.97,7088.114,7098.091,"Writes, when we had conversations about how to evaluate our programs with our Stakeholders, equity was the number one priority that came out of that Conversaion.",100,,
947,0.97,7098.091,7149.976,"So, with that, the criteria that we use to evaluate all of those, of those seven criteria when I show you the blue Quilt of ratings, equity had a rubric to score and programs that had a High-Scoring equity could deliver 75% or more of their program into these areas that have been this invested in in the past, De-Invested in in the past, we worked with the work programs and found that their proposals could deliver more than 75% of their work into these areas, they were flexible enough to do that.",100,,
948,0.97,7149.976,7150.576,"Okay, thank you.",101,,
949,0.97,7150.576,7189.215,"To add onto that slightly, a finer point, this is still a Philly small amount of investment overall and the needs that we have from the asset perspective across the portfolio, in looking at things like sidewalk investments and crossings and remarking and things like that, those are things that can be directed towards areas that need that and are addressing some of the equity challenges we have doing their also assets that need investment anyway.",102,,
950,0.97,7189.215,7192.685,And I follow up with one more question?,103,,
951,0.97,7192.685,7208.734,"So, when I look at the map, I don't think you had it on here, but I know there is a map of missing sidewalks in the city and most are in the areas here that are dark yellow.",103,,
952,0.97,7208.734,7225.284,"It also does not surprise me, but when you had that list of Stakeholders that you engaged with, I did not see any organizations, maybe I did not read at all, the represented or might include folks who live with disabilities.",103,,
953,0.97,7225.284,7266.492,"We know that very often those folks are also experiencing poverty, so, again, those community members, I engage with a lot of folks who live with short disabilities or some sort of disabilities or low income and there are missing sidewalks, all of that is to say, can you talk a little bit about how and whether those folks were included in the conversations that you had heating up to this spend plan?",103,,
954,0.97,7266.492,7276.369,"Yes, we can get back to you with a list of specific folks that were invited, I know that not everyone could attend that was invited, Anya, do you have anything?",104,,
955,0.97,7276.369,7286.679,"I can add a little bit, some of the organizations that were represented, represent multiple perspectives in terms of abilities.",105,,
956,0.97,7286.679,7308.968,"Some of the Stakeholders within the equity group, I know, one organization works with seniors and also puts disability work in there as well, there is an intersection nullity in terms of representation, I will say that, that we could definitely get back to you with a list of representations.",105,,
957,0.97,7308.968,7313.539,Thank you.,106,,
958,0.97,7313.539,7316.842,Councilmember Lisa Herbold?,107,,
959,0.97,7316.842,7399.492,"If you go back to that map, just the planning measure of low risk or high risk to displacement and low access to opportunity is a definition of planning and development and it has been created with things like citywide planning . My reflection of that map for areas that are both high risk and low access to opportunity and I am wondering if this map instead represents not only neighborhoods that both have high risk of displacement and low access to opportunity, but also neighborhoods that have just one of those two categories.",108,,
960,0.97,7399.492,7417.51,"Yes, so the list is, it may be that is the case, I will have to check that, it is looking at neighborhoods by Quintiles and I think this is the bottom three Quintiles and Sam has more familiarity with the maps themselves, we could also get back to on that.",109,,
961,0.97,7417.51,7448.641,"The reason why I ask, I think that using both categories together, focusing on neighborhoods that have both high risk of displacement and low access to opportunity, using both of those Cardio, categories together, makes it more meaningful for areas of targeted investment or targeted Land-Use policies, specifically to address those conditions.",110,,
962,0.97,7448.641,7467.226,"If you are including neighborhoods that just have one of those categories, then it becomes less meaningful as a tool to really have focus on investment and focused planning tools.",110,,
963,0.97,7467.226,7477.603,That is why I would be interested to know a little bit more about how this map was created and how those areas were identified.,110,,
964,0.97,7477.603,7501.293,"Absolutely, we have also taken in the last year the added layer of where the pandemic has been most Impactful in terms of the Covid pandemic which has a more focused geography of some communities where we have seen the overlapping impacts of the pandemic and historic Underinvestment and the economic distress brought about an vulnerability to this.",111,,
965,0.97,7501.293,7526.151,"I think this is that initial cut of inequity focus, but our work and the work that we talked about goes deeper in that in terms of how we really think about the investments we make an infrastructure that supports community.",111,,
966,0.97,7526.151,7542.101,"Thank you Councilmember Lisa Herbold, I do have one update, Anna who commented earlier represented disability rights of Washington and she did attend our outreach session.",112,,
967,0.97,7542.101,7547.273,Thank you.,113,,
968,0.97,7547.273,7572.164,"Let's see, so, I am happy to talk about the amendment, again, we will be discussing this on May 5th as well in our Committee, I am happy to just put that out there and we can talk about it with Councilmember Lewis and Councilmember Lisa Herbold or anyone else that wants to jump on as a cosponsor.",114,,
969,0.97,7572.164,7607.232,"I can go ahead and go first, what the amendment does is basically accept this counsel still as it is in terms of what would happen and is an annual spending bill anyway, so basically, say, yes, for 2021, we will do with the Stakeholder group is recommending and that is one of the pie charts they had shown in their Powerpoint and that breaks up the $7 million or 3.5, it breaks it up into six different buckets.",115,,
970,0.97,7607.232,7632.658,To have Sdot come back to us in September before the fall budget process and have not spent there is an emphasis on Multilevel bridges because of how expensive they are and the fact that bridges have not been getting that attention.,115,,
971,0.97,7632.658,7643.235,There would still be $25 million available for these projects and programs that we have just gone over here.,115,,
972,0.97,7643.235,7665.057,"So, when I look at each of these buckets, or slices of that pie, and you see $1 million, $2 million, a few hundred thousand dollars, one of the benefits of doing the bonds is you get $25 million or more right away and then you can address things quickly.",115,,
973,0.97,7665.057,7699.391,"In terms of job creation, that would also, you know, that is more work than Sdot staff could do, so there could be Outsourcing some work and creating jobs and we heard a lot from the construction labor unions and they seemed excited today on the labor amendment if Councilmember Lewis or Councilmember Lisa Herbold want to speak, they can, I can also answer any questions.",115,,
974,0.97,7699.391,7708.967,"And they can come back to us with a proposal that they be, that then we would consider at that time.",115,,
975,0.97,7708.967,7709.568,Councilmember Lewis?,116,,
976,0.97,7709.568,7712.504,It looks like Councilmember Lisa Herbold has her hand up.,117,,
977,0.97,7712.504,7720.145,I am happy to go after.,117,,
978,0.97,7720.145,7723.582,I just want to confirm my understanding.,118,,
979,0.97,7723.582,7735.16,"This in no way impacts the recommended plan for 2021, correct?",118,,
980,0.97,7735.16,7736.261,Correct.,119,,
981,0.97,7736.261,7749.074,"That is what I thought, it is only asking for a plan within the parameters on what we are identifying.",120,,
982,0.97,7749.074,7795.087,"The other thing I want to underscore is one of the reasons why we are interested in a bonding proposal is in recognition that again, we are not going to have any opportunity to identify a fund source to address the needs associated with bridgework until planning for a new levy which would begin in 2023 and would go on the ballot in 2024 for funding that would not be available until 2025.",120,,
983,0.97,7795.087,7827.452,Some of the things I have been hearing in opposition and bond financing and we have heard and overcome as a counsel when the counsel wanted to use our bonding authority for a small housing bond to augment in a single year the funding that we were putting towards very affordable housing.,120,,
984,0.97,7827.452,7856.481,"It is true the bond financing has a cost associated with it, but, again, I do not see acting on the recommendations of the city auditor as something that is discretionary, it is something that we must do and we have to find the resources to do so.",120,,
985,0.97,7856.481,7901.126,"I recognize that in the grand scheme of the cost associated with maintaining and doing some retrofitting of bridges, $100 million is small potatoes, but, I think it is really important for our city and the cities across the country to anticipate larger infrastructure investments from the Federal Government and these dollars will complement those dollars that I know we are all open for, thanks.",120,,
986,0.97,7901.126,7903.395,"Thank you Councilmember, Councilmember Lewis?",121,,
987,0.97,7903.395,7914.239,"Thank you, happy to make my first guest appearance here in the transportation Committee, thank you for the invitation.",122,,
988,0.97,7914.239,7986.945,"I believe my official position as co-author given how we have to structure the naming and I am happy to co-author this proposal, and we are making progress on the long deferred and the infrastructure in the United States is critical, the city of Seattle needs to be Well-Positioned to capitalize on those opportunities and additional investment in infrastructure make sure we want to make sure we have resources to attract from Olympia and from Washington, D.C. and $100 million in and of itself is not going to be the linchpin that holds together major financing for big capital projects, it can be of big chunk and the key to unlocking significant investment.",122,,
989,0.97,7986.945,8022.547,"I think this is a good strategy especially given interest rates interest rates, they are so low, and the major Federal investment on the horizon will allow and hopefully Sdot can speak to this and this bonding capacity they can use in their planning with other jurisdictions to nail down the financing plans for some of the new projects coming down the line.",122,,
990,0.97,8022.547,8045.137,"I think it allows us to really Úquickly and intentionally make really big and significant process on a lot of the vision zero and other Multimodal projects instead of a trickle of maintenance over a period of years to significantly overhaul, and hands, and expand.",122,,
991,0.97,8045.137,8048.473,Some of these systems are here now rather than over a term of several decades.,122,,
992,0.97,8048.473,8080.906,"This allows us to build out additional added sidewalks rather than just repairing existing ones or have a process where we do a few additional ramp cuts, curb cuts in the sidewalks in a given year and allow us to do those quickly and mixing it in with various sources of support.",122,,
993,0.97,8080.906,8110.135,"I feel this is a way to harness and build that better Mantra that we are seeing in Olympia and Washington, D.C. and to position ourselves well to appreciate this new environment for the city that reflects our new Multimodal future rather than merely repairing and fixing up a mid century transportation system.",122,,
994,0.97,8110.135,8118.543,"With that, no additional comments, thank you for allowing me to drop by.",122,,
995,0.97,8118.543,8119.144,Councilmember Lewis.,123,,
996,0.97,8119.144,8124.716,I want to address a comment that was made earlier about interest costs.,123,,
997,0.97,8124.716,8127.319,Interest rates are at an All- time low now.,123,,
998,0.97,8127.319,8139.331,One of the benefits of getting interest costs such as one aspect and getting that $100 million immediately.,123,,
999,0.97,8139.331,8145.237,There is a benefit to getting this.,123,,
1000,0.97,8145.237,8165.657,"It is more valuable to get it Upfront and it is something to consider when we look at cost and benefits and maybe getting $100 million all at once instead of 100 over 20 years, I just want to put that out there.",123,,
1001,0.97,8165.657,8172.297,"Director, do you have your hand up?",123,,
1002,0.97,8172.297,8185.71,"Councilmember Lewis alluded to some feedback we might have on this and I thought I might offer, if it is Okay, a few comments and responses.",124,,
1003,0.97,8185.71,8186.411,Please.,125,,
1004,0.97,8186.411,8195.353,"Since you took office, we had many conversations about the need for investment and maintenance in our infrastructure.",126,,
1005,0.97,8195.353,8217.442,"I wholeheartedly agree, what I think is challenging against this ongoing revenue source is it would take the investments we could be making over time, and again, investments and maintenance is one of the hardest things to secure funding for and we could make this into a one time and turn this into a set of projects.",126,,
1006,0.97,8217.442,8223.548,Maybe we could come up with some by September but I don't have the list ready to go right now.,126,,
1007,0.97,8223.548,8234.559,On the bridge side it would take 20 years of a revenue stream and make it into a one- time source and we would still struggle with the maintenance activities that we need.,126,,
1008,0.97,8234.559,8240.265,We thought about a whole range of ways to invest as we were formulating the process.,126,,
1009,0.97,8240.265,8251.476,We really thought this was a great new source of revenue for investment in our infrastructure from the maintenance perspective.,126,,
1010,0.97,8251.476,8263.955,"So, I do have some real reservations on trying to take that and trying to move it out the door quickly.",126,,
1011,0.97,8263.955,8276.901,"I also, I want to say, we recognize what is going on at the state and Federal level, we never struggle to come up with matching funds for those resources.",126,,
1012,0.97,8276.901,8279.771,We continue to pursue Federal grant resources and state resources around major capital processes.,126,,
1013,0.97,8279.771,8285.71,I have no doubt the as opportunities come up we will be able to.,126,,
1014,0.97,8285.71,8305.33,"We have put something in for the West Seattle bridge and will have one on the new program, we continue to secure at the state and Federal level and matching funds has never been a challenge for us in securing the.",126,,
1015,0.97,8305.33,8305.697,Securing those.,126,,
1016,0.97,8305.697,8333.958,"Thank you director Sam Zimbabwe, your budget is hundreds of millions of dollars so finding this, this is new money, I just think it is possible for there to be Prioritization within your large budget and $7 million, there is a way to find that for repair maintenance if you want to Prioritize that.",127,,
1017,0.97,8333.958,8346.237,I'm not sure it is fair to say this new bucket of money would have to go towards that.,127,,
1018,0.97,8346.237,8370.595,"Also, we are hoping to get, we are not sure with the state government will pull off, this year, regarding estate transportation package, we hope the Federal Government can do more on infrastructure, there's a lot of talk about it in Washington, D.C., I am hoping the Sdot will be able to take Advantae of that and absorb the large sums that could come our way.",127,,
1019,0.97,8370.595,8373.698,I'm hoping that you are getting ready for that one way or the other.,127,,
1020,0.97,8373.698,8379.07,"Councilmember Tammy Morales, to have a follow-up?",127,,
1021,0.97,8379.07,8397.989,"Yes, I don't know if this is for director Sam Zimbabwe or central staff, or anyone at this point, I am interested on if there is a Federal infrastructure package or allocation, if we have any sense of what the parameters of that would be.",128,,
1022,0.97,8397.989,8406.531,"What I understand is 10 bridges across the country, or what that would be used for.",128,,
1023,0.97,8406.531,8424.449,"All of that is still up in the air, trying to understand how we could use that money to support whatever and support the backlog.",128,,
1024,0.97,8424.449,8467.192,"The other question, if I understand the idea, it seems the proposal would use $25 million early and it would replace $80 million would come in overtime for sidewalk repairs I'm not sure if that is Sam or Calvin that would be able to answer that, but that is one of the Trade-Offs that they are asking us to make and I am not sure if that makes sense.",128,,
1025,0.97,8467.192,8475.9,"I can address that, Calvin, I see your hand is raised.",129,,
1026,0.97,8475.9,8487.979,"This bond proposal would be $20 million and I am not sure where the 80 million is coming from, I did hear someone mention that figure.",129,,
1027,0.97,8487.979,8498.79,"Calvin, did you want to try and address that?",129,,
1028,0.97,8498.79,8503.828,"I wanted to start with the first part of the question, a lot of the Federal and state funding opportunities are still being defined.",130,,
1029,0.97,8503.828,8513.738,In addition to the infrastructure and Federal funding there is potentially a reauthorization that could be a potential source for funding.,130,,
1030,0.97,8513.738,8528.52,There could be some Earmarks going into the programs that the vast majority will be formula and competitive programs that will go three existing administrative grant programs and will be reliant on future budgets to make this available.,130,,
1031,0.97,8528.52,8539.03,Will sort of set up with those grant sectors look like in the future and that is the type of thing Sdot has history preparing for.,130,,
1032,0.97,8539.03,8549.474,"I think when we think about financing, those are choices that we can make as we go Incrementally when opportunities present themselves need to figure out how that fits in.",130,,
1033,0.97,8549.474,8561.152,A lot of the conversation today is the Cousel considering how important is it to try and really push for large account spending now.,130,,
1034,0.97,8561.152,8572.463,"I think, a lot of these Federal grant programs tend to focus on the delivery of capital and not so much the regular operating and maintenance that Sam was alluding to.",130,,
1035,0.97,8572.463,8578.269,Grants typically want to show a large project as sort of a success.,130,,
1036,0.97,8578.269,8591.916,"This has been the history of most government infrastructure spending, it is easier to find money for a new thing.",130,,
1037,0.97,8591.916,8593.584,It is also useful to discuss what maintenance means.,130,,
1038,0.97,8593.584,8598.423,I think a lot of the proposed spending that we are talking about is actual construction jobs and spending to repair what is there.,130,,
1039,0.97,8598.423,8608.633,"You know, I think we are a bit trapped in our language and I think we need to find a way to have a conversation on what the Finance pitch looks like.",130,,
1040,0.97,8608.633,8635.226,"We have the Seattle levy coming up at a future time, that's typically the time when we have considered when the bridging the gap was first proposed, that is where we got the commercial parking funding, there is a bigger Timefrae to think about what is possible.",130,,
1041,0.97,8635.226,8639.864,I think we probably need some better understanding of what the Federal and state funding opportunities are to help inform that.,130,,
1042,0.97,8639.864,8659.25,"I don't think we are necessarily missing any opportunities, even if Congress made the opportunity tomorrow, it would take some time to roll out how we would access that, it is important to understand what that is, it is important for that levy.",130,,
1043,0.97,8659.25,8666.357,There is also the Flipside of Sdot asset management and infrastructure and what they know on what they need.,130,,
1044,0.97,8666.357,8670.862,"He can point to deficiencies, to me, that is not the same thing as developing.",130,,
1045,0.97,8670.862,8690.048,"A project needs develop meaning and baseline costs based on assumptions and then later on not because of the cost of change, but maybe something went wrong in the project and that we know more on what that project is.",130,,
1046,0.97,8690.048,8695.62,What level of understanding and what level cost we will need as well.,130,,
1047,0.97,8695.62,8708.833,"All that to say, I think we are talking about this coming to light in the context of a relatively small for this $20 Vlf.",130,,
1048,0.97,8708.833,8727.351,"I think there is opportunity to talk about this, clearly the Councilmembers can decide which way to go on this, those are the thoughts, not sure if I answered your question.",130,,
1049,0.97,8727.351,8727.852,Thank you.,131,,
1050,0.97,8727.852,8739.33,"From my understanding on the bridge talk from Washington, D.C., it is really those major Interstate ridges that they're talking about, not really every city has as many waterways and ravines as we do.",132,,
1051,0.97,8739.33,8752.677,That is a concern that we will not trickle down to bridges we care about like the second Avenue South extension or university bridge or ballot bridge.,132,,
1052,0.97,8752.677,8765.523,"It is something for us to think about over the next few weeks, are there any other questions about this question or amendment?",132,,
1053,0.97,8765.523,8768.593,"I have general questions, if I can.",133,,
1054,0.97,8768.593,8788.613,"Thank you chairs, chair Alex Pederson, I want to start my line of inquiry from the perspective of identifying what I think is common ground.",134,,
1055,0.97,8788.613,8843.634,"What I think is common ground is that we all agree that we need to take care of our infrastructure and we need to act quickly but judiciously to make sure that we can address infrastructure maintenance needs before they fail as a West Seattle residents and citywide representative, I know what happens when a major piece of infrastructure fails for transit users, the city, people who drive cars, it is just bad, I just want to start by acknowledging that we are all on the same page and we need to have a plan to address feeling infrastructure needs before complete failure occurs.",134,,
1056,0.97,8843.634,8858.182,"I appreciate the opportunity and think the way this conversation is being framed I hope is in the context of we have this problem, we have this issue, we need to solve it, this is how we can do this.",134,,
1057,0.97,8858.182,8876.901,What I am struggling with is whether or not this is the proper mechanism by which to address the scale of the problem facing the city as it relates to the infrastructure.,134,,
1058,0.97,8876.901,8911.636,"I am not Prejudging the proposal one way or another, I am expressing what my early thinking is which is sort of wanting to be honest some of the comments that have been made and these off-line conversations saying we have to do this in a way that is Multimodal and does not hit transit and Non-Vehicle mobility with single occupancy vehicle modes of transportation.",134,,
1059,0.97,8911.636,8960.551,"For me, it will be important to hear from Sdot and their perspective, I understand the amendment does not impact the spending plan as Crafted by Stakeholders,, when we have done this in the past that included Stakeholders or maybe did not, was it always a Year- By-Year plan in terms of the spending or was sort of the vision, we are going to have a spending plan or principles that are going to dictate how we will spend the money for the life of the BLS.",134,,
1060,0.97,8960.551,8982.206,"The last time there was this kind of Stakeholder engagement, well Predating me, but at the inception of the SPD and vehicle license fee, that has continued to guide the general approach to the base $20 vehicle license fee over the last decade.",135,,
1061,0.97,8982.206,8994.018,"I do think we entered the conversation with Stakeholders thinking we were not just talking about half a year set of investments, but that Longer- term guiding Principl.",135,,
1062,0.97,8994.018,9006.831,I would say that baseline $20 vehicle licensing fee supports a number of multi modal maintenance.,135,,
1063,0.97,9006.831,9015.906,There are small-scale capital investments.,135,,
1064,0.97,9015.906,9034.024,Having the grounding in Stakeholder engagement and supporting a long-term approach really help with the sustainable ongoing expenditure that does get addressed through the every year budget process and sort of has a framework.,135,,
1065,0.97,9034.024,9039.33,"Calvin, you had your hands up.",136,,
1066,0.97,9039.33,9062.853,"I just wanted to add in the Email transmittal that I sent to Councilmembers directly, it really focused on the next four years before the levy and left open the fact that when the levy is up for reauthorization, it may require all of these revenue sources.",137,,
1067,0.97,9062.853,9090.681,"There is maybe a difference a little bit in terms of the legislation here which is really a budget appropriation transfer, it is a little bit different than what was transmitted which is really focusing on the immediate future and the distinction between the anticipation of potentially using the resources for the next 20 years.",137,,
1068,0.97,9090.681,9144.168,"Okay, so then, this amendment, it RAISES the policy question of a shift of establishing guiding principles through a Stakeholder process that influence in a sustainable way and guides the manner in which the manor is done on a year-to-year basis and under that umbrella perspective, this would modify that by effectively doing a Year-To- year spending plan now?",138,,
1069,0.97,9144.168,9151.375,"I think with any spending plan, it is what the executives plans to transmit in future years.",139,,
1070,0.97,9151.375,9156.614,We do the budgeting yearly on a biannual piece.,139,,
1071,0.97,9156.614,9174.365,I think the amendment in front of us suggest the counsel is interested in looking at capital spending and we have seen how the Department responds and the counsel might need to consider it.,139,,
1072,0.97,9174.365,9186.977,And they are interested in doing capital spending.,139,,
1073,0.97,9186.977,9235.025,"Okay, does the amendment before us account for and I think Councilmember Tammy Morales was alluding to this, does this account for or allow for any sort of flexibility in terms of the signaling to Sdot to account for additional revenue sources that may be better, more sustainable, or consistent with the fiscal policy options to fund the scale of the need here?",140,,
1074,0.97,9235.025,9243.534,"It just speaks to a project list, everything else signals intent but is not necessarily finding or asking for anything different.",141,,
1075,0.97,9243.534,9256.547,The specific change to the legislation is to ask Sdot to provide $100 million project list for consideration by September 30th.,141,,
1076,0.97,9256.547,9285.643,"Right, but the intent would be, I think, the way I am reading the intent and hearing it from the co-author and cosponsors is the reason to generate this list is it is laying a foundation to propose funding and this has not yet been approved but would be considered as part of the process.",142,,
1077,0.97,9285.643,9293.784,"That is correct, the recital States that his counsel's intent.",143,,
1078,0.97,9293.784,9302.393,"I guess what I'm asking is, I want to make sure it is devoid of language that would allow the city Cousel to pursue a different option if a different option became available.",144,,
1079,0.97,9302.393,9344.935,"In other words, if the hundred million dollars list of capital projects became available to city Cousel and, by the time we get to the fall budget process which feels like an eternity but really is around the corner does the amendment allow for the city Cousel to effectively shift from this bonding proposal to something else that would still meet capital needs of maintaining our transportation infrastructure but perhaps not rely on Vlf is the revenue stream.",144,,
1080,0.97,9344.935,9354.678,"This does nothing to direct the 2022 budget, it does not direct specific bonds, just signals interest, so it would not constrain counsel actions in the 2022 budget.",145,,
1081,0.97,9354.678,9367.791,"Okay, we would still have an option to pursue other revenue streams to effectuate this bonding intent that is outside the scope of the Vlf.",146,,
1082,0.97,9367.791,9368.992,Yes.,147,,
1083,0.97,9368.992,9372.296,All right.,148,,
1084,0.97,9372.296,9373.697,I think that is it for me.,148,,
1085,0.97,9373.697,9381.472,"Thank you, Councilmember.",149,,
1086,0.97,9381.472,9384.575,Councilmember Debora Juarez?,149,,
1087,0.97,9384.575,9407.464,"Thank you, thank you Councilmember Alex Pederson, I do sit on the board and have some experience in issuing Tax- exempt bonds and big capital projects, I am glad that you had an opening statement to kind of share and we heard there was some confusion.",150,,
1088,0.97,9407.464,9416.84,"Today, this amendment as Calvin intelligently put it out, signals and interest based on the auditor's report.",150,,
1089,0.97,9416.84,9471.895,"The amendment is directing Sdot to go back and bring back to the Seattle city Cousel in September, and we would be making a policy decision about the policies that were listed, 75% for bridges, 25% for sidewalks, if we were this in September we would have a full report and I'm guessing in that report, we normally look at capital infrastructure or essential government services or projects, there would be a flow funds chart and it would tell us what the Upfront capital spending would be and everything else, I think, today there was some miscommunication, I heard in some of the public comment and some of the information and phone calls I got that counsel is voting to pass an amendment to pass a bond.",150,,
1090,0.97,9471.895,9478.001,There is a lot of work between now and September.,150,,
1091,0.97,9478.001,9495.152,"I think more as a policy perspective in my opinion, I support the amendment because I believe particularly in what happened for two big reasons, number one, West Seattle bridge failed, that has not been good for anyone, whether you are Biking, walking, on a bus or Commerce.",150,,
1092,0.97,9495.152,9496.32,It has affected Commerce dramatically.,150,,
1093,0.97,9496.32,9516.44,"We spend a ton of time in sound transit on transportation, I'm on that subcommittee, as well as Councilmember Gonzales, struggling with the maintenance, the infrastructure, the bridge, and getting money for the bridge.",150,,
1094,0.97,9516.44,9524.414,"When we got the auditors report back and we see 4-5 bridges ranked poor, it is our job as electives to say the infrastructure is important.",150,,
1095,0.97,9524.414,9539.062,"This is nothing against those that right bikes that want to walk and bus, it is about the infrastructure on the bridges to make sure that they are safe and make sure our city runs.",150,,
1096,0.97,9539.062,9600.49,"I agree with what Calvin said, we will always have some opportunity for Federal money to have matching funds but, they mainly look at, and when looking at grants and particular project money, they are more interested they will build a brand-new shiny thing then fix something old but there is still the opportunity there that will not go away and I agree with what Councilmember Lewis said, this does give us an opportunity to have the information with the new administration on Department of transportation and what I have learned from sound transit with build back better, there will be Federal money there and we are hoping and counting on that since Washington state is the number one state thickets the most money and thank you to our congressional delegation and in particular, to senators, I feel like the wind is behind our back and it has momentum to think big and move forward.",150,,
1097,0.97,9600.49,9605.195,"For that reason, I would support the amendment, I know we are not voting on this, I understand, or am guessing, but, are we?",150,,
1098,0.97,9605.195,9608.832,"Correct, we are not voting on it.",151,,
1099,0.97,9608.832,9633.123,"We have a lot of room for discussion and the one thing that is really important is I have been looking at the material and including Sdot the 2017 report and information on the bridges, it was important what labor shared with us, we will have to build back better from the pandemic and we are going to need these jobs.",151,,
1100,0.97,9633.123,9645.168,I cannot think of a better place to land to provide those opportunities then to build our infrastructure when we are trying to get more money for the Federal Government.,151,,
1101,0.97,9645.168,9647.771,"So, with that, that is all I have to share.",151,,
1102,0.97,9647.771,9651.375,Thank you Councilmember.,152,,
1103,0.97,9651.375,9658.615,Councilmember,153,,
1104,0.97,9672.396,9675.699,"I just want to say, I appreciate the conversation we had yesterday.",154,,
1105,0.97,9675.699,9685.776,I want to say at the start that I don't think the need to invest in the maintenance of bridges and the need to invest in better sidewalks are mutually exclusive.,154,,
1106,0.97,9685.776,9688.812,We are a city surrounded by water.,154,,
1107,0.97,9688.812,9694.518,We need our bridges to be able to get around safely.,154,,
1108,0.97,9694.518,9708.098,"And we have--you know, I have thousands of constituents who don't have any choice but to use our sidewalks to get around and do the things they need to do.",154,,
1109,0.97,9708.098,9720.744,"So my question, and the questions I will be trying to get answered over the next couple weeks, are really about, you know, not just--I'm also not opposed to bonding.",154,,
1110,0.97,9720.744,9733.023,"I just have a question about whether signaling an intent for the remainder of this Fund, that 75% of it goes to bridges, is the right amount.",154,,
1111,0.97,9733.023,9740.931,I have two Constituentses who died in the last two weeks hit on their bicycles.,154,,
1112,0.97,9740.931,9753.31,I've been walking up and down Rainier Avenue with folks from Lighthouse for the blind to see how hard it is for them to navigate up and down Rainier Avenue.,154,,
1113,0.97,9753.31,9758.648,We have hundreds of housing units that are in the pipeline on Rainier Avenue.,154,,
1114,0.97,9758.648,9765.322,"As somebody mentioned earlier, the sidewalks are buckling from tree roots.",154,,
1115,0.97,9765.322,9768.625,"It's loud, it's noisy.",154,,
1116,0.97,9768.625,9773.363,It's dangerous to walk down that street given the condition of the sidewalks.,154,,
1117,0.97,9773.363,9778.368,That's just one street in my district.,154,,
1118,0.97,9778.368,9788.445,"So I support the need, especially for seismic Retrofits of our bridges, and want to be sure people can get around our city safely.",154,,
1119,0.97,9788.445,9798.855,"It's also important to be sure people can get around our neighborhoods safely, particularly for those in Wheelchairs or using a Walker.",154,,
1120,0.97,9798.855,9808.698,I've got lots of seniors down here who can barely get themselves across the street because the signal timing is so short and they're you guys a Walker.,154,,
1121,0.97,9808.698,9819.242,"So I have a lot of questions still, and will be eager to be in Communiction with all of you before we have to vote on this.",154,,
1122,0.97,9819.242,9819.476,Thanks.,154,,
1123,0.97,9819.476,9829.719,Thank you.,155,,
1124,0.97,9830.787,9832.589,I appreciate the robust discussion today.,155,,
1125,0.97,9832.589,9838.562,I think there is a desire to address things faster and to get ready.,155,,
1126,0.97,9838.562,9850.24,"So even though we'll vote on this next time, that's one of the benefit that is gets them thinking about how to go bigger faster if that's something we want to do.",155,,
1127,0.97,9850.24,9851.308,"Thank you, everybody.",155,,
1128,0.97,9851.308,9856.079,Appreciate that discussion on item two.,155,,

1194,0.97,10430.052,10455.578,"There are many continuing and growing pressures on Spu rates including response to climate change, response to seismic activity and all these efforts reduce the waste for customers.",165,,
1195,0.97,10455.578,10461.684,We want to map out how we can address this long-term challenge.,165,,
1196,0.97,10461.684,10475.198,"In closing, on behalf of the panel, I want to express our appreciation for what Spu does and their efforts with everyone dedicated to the process.",165,,
1197,0.97,10475.198,10479.468,We appreciate the partnership we have had with the team.,165,,
1198,0.97,10479.468,10487.81,"One last thing, a desire for the enhanced engagement between the panel and Mayor and city council offices.",165,,
1199,0.97,10487.81,10495.651,"We think ongoing communication of concerns, priorities and questions will help us do our job better as a panel.",165,,
1200,0.97,10495.651,10502.325,At this time please let me know if you have any comments or questions.,165,,
1201,0.97,10502.325,10505.061,Thank you so much for that presentation.,166,,
1202,0.97,10505.061,10520.71,"For the other members of the review panel who may be watching, I want to thank them for their service and continuing to provide oversight in addition to what this Committee is able to do and what the central staff is able to do.",166,,
1203,0.97,10520.71,10526.749,It's a large enterprise to have that additional oversight.,166,,
1204,0.97,10526.749,10539.095,Appreciate your focus on Affordability as being a unifying theme since utility bills are essentially progressive but necessary.,166,,
1205,0.97,10539.095,10544.967,Focusing on Affordability helps hundreds of thousands of rate payers.,166,,
1206,0.97,10544.967,10548.738,So any questions for the review panel?,166,,
1207,0.97,10548.738,10554.71,Then we can also ask Brian any questions about his memo.,166,,
1208,0.97,10554.71,10560.683,We'll be voting on this the next committee meeting may 5th.,166,,
1209,0.97,10560.683,10567.49,We wanted to give it three hearings because it impacts the rates.,166,,
1210,0.97,10567.49,10575.031,That's a Testament to all the good work--Council member?,166,,
1211,0.97,10575.031,10589.912,"I want to thank the customer panel for all the work they do and the number of hours of meetings, really commendable and awe-inspiring.",167,,
1212,0.97,10589.912,10606.062,As a person who really relies on your input as experts in this area and stake holders.,167,,
1213,0.97,10606.062,10611.534,I have an issue with a position on the advice in prior years.,167,,
1214,0.97,10611.534,10631.354,"Ic in two prior letters to the Council related to the rate path, the customer review panel has spoken specifically to its support for utility impact fees.",167,,
1215,0.97,10631.354,10639.028,And I did not see that Referenced in this letter.,167,,
1216,0.97,10639.028,10651.507,"I appreciate that Seattle public utilities has done lot of good work in updating the water tap connection fees, partially in response to the recommendations.",167,,
1217,0.97,10651.507,10672.061,But there was a larger body of work associated with waste water and drainage impact fees that they have done a significant amount of analysis on and developed options for us to consider.,167,,
1218,0.97,10672.061,10697.987,Just wondering whether or not this is work that the customer review panel still supports or if there's been new thinking on that approach as one that could help drive some of the Affordability concerns that we have about projects that drive rates.,167,,
1219,0.97,10697.987,10704.46,"Well, we pressed forward from this with the last plan.",168,,
1220,0.97,10704.46,10721.477,The initial analysis was done and stake holders weighed in in regards to the concern over housing Affordability and how this would impact that by putting these rates on.,168,,
1221,0.97,10721.477,10742.865,"I think what I heard was that there was a desire to put these rates on more expensive real estate, but the lawyers weighed in and said that wasn't--there wasn't a legal path for that.",168,,
1222,0.97,10742.865,10745.101,That's all I knee about it.,168,,
1223,0.97,10745.101,10758.28,"I think there's been more discussion, particularly in the Mayor's office in regards to this.",168,,
1224,0.97,10758.28,10779.502,"As I have recognized in much of your analysis, the city of Seattle is rather unique in the impact fees that we have to the utility infrastructure.",169,,
1225,0.97,10779.502,10798.521,"And my recollection is that Spu did an analysis around an impact fee structure that was designed in a way to, you know, basically avoid driving up the cost to build affordable housing.",169,,
1226,0.97,10798.521,10813.202,"And just wanting to understand a little bit more about customer review panels around that, share your concerns about impact fees driving up the cost of affordable housing.",169,,
1227,0.97,10813.202,10835.724,"And perhaps we can connect later with some of the materials that Seattle public utilities has developed in this area, and specifically the strategies that they have suggested to avoid Impacting affordable housing development.",169,,
1228,0.97,10835.724,10866.855,It was certainly when we started our quarterly review part of the plan but there were so many other issues that's why you haven't seen that.,170,,
1229,0.97,10866.855,10897.92,"Thank you, and I support looking at that so we don't have a situation where we're increasing rates on rate payers and not capturing costs in another way.",171,,
1230,0.97,10897.92,10903.659,I think they are coming in lower than average of what was promised in 2018.,171,,
1231,0.97,10903.659,10912.101,That may not be sustainable for the next strategic plan.,171,,
1232,0.97,10912.101,10946.568,"The system development charges to me are still on the table and need to be looked at as a potential source, as well as being careful about during the budget process when we use utility taxes, taking funds from the utilities and put them to good use from the general fund.",171,,
1233,0.97,10946.568,10948.037,It is to be cognizant of.,171,,
1234,0.97,10948.037,10958.58,"Noel, I think you have concerns about the utility tax as well that's being charged?",171,,
1235,0.97,10958.58,10960.983,"Yeah, it's an ongoing concern.",172,,
1236,0.97,10960.983,10975.597,We made a recommendation the last time to maybe look at indexing the total taxes that are collected more towards a rate of inflation being lower than the rate path.,172,,
1237,0.97,10975.597,10983.238,So that would provide a little help there.,172,,
1238,0.97,10983.238,10983.906,Thank you.,173,,
1239,0.97,10983.906,10991.38,Any questions for the second time we are hearing about the rate path?,173,,
1240,0.97,10991.38,10996.652,"Again, we'll vote on May 5th.",173,,
1241,0.97,10996.652,10996.885,Okay.,173,,
1242,0.97,10996.885,11003.225,"Thank you, Brian and Spu for being on the line today.",173,,
1243,0.97,11003.225,11003.525,On this.,173,,
1244,0.97,11003.525,11013.402,"If there are amendments, we'll get those to Brian in the next two days.",173,,
1245,0.97,11013.402,11018.04,Next item is item four on the agenda.,173,,
1246,0.97,11018.04,11052.441,"Item four, an ordinance relating to the city light Department declaring certain real property rights to be Surplussed to the needs of city lights and authorizing general manager and Ceo to execute an easement agreement with King County, allowing a portion of the use to resolve the encroachment of an existing structure.",174,,
1247,0.97,11052.441,11063.352,For public hearing and discussion.,174,,
1248,0.97,11063.352,11063.752,Thank you.,175,,
1249,0.97,11063.752,11075.33,"We'll have the public hearing and actually do the presentation--we can't vote on it today, so we're going to move the presentation on May 5, where we'll vote on it anyway.",175,,
1250,0.97,11075.33,11089.578,We want to of the public meeting today so people interested in this have the opportunity to have read the items posted on the agenda previously and speak to them at a public hearing.,175,,
1251,0.97,11089.578,11094.083,This is just about the Georgetown and South Park trail.,175,,
1252,0.97,11094.083,11096.051,It's a step toward that.,175,,
1253,0.97,11096.051,11099.221,We voted on another piece of that earlier.,175,,
1254,0.97,11099.221,11117.84,This is a necessary piece that has to occur on the Georgetown South Park trail.,175,,
1255,0.97,11117.84,11123.345,At all the time go ahead and open the public hearing.,175,,
1256,0.97,11123.345,11124.68,Eric is here from central staff.,175,,
1257,0.97,11124.68,11132.12,Did you want to speak to this item before I see if there are any speakers signed up for the public hearing?,175,,
1258,0.97,11132.12,11135.757,I think you said the things I would have offered.,176,,
1259,0.97,11135.757,11142.931,"If someone from city light feels there's something important to say before the public hearing, maybe they have a moment to do that.",176,,
1260,0.97,11142.931,11152.674,Otherwise I'll stand down.,176,,
1261,0.97,11152.674,11153.408,Thank you.,177,,
1262,0.97,11153.408,11153.709,Thank you.,177,,
1263,0.97,11153.709,11159.381,I guess I have a question for the information technology folks.,177,,
1264,0.97,11159.381,11162.651,Are there any speakers for the public hearing?,177,,
1265,0.97,11162.651,11167.856,"No, there's not.",178,,
1266,0.97,11167.856,11169.358,Okay.,179,,
1267,0.97,11169.358,11169.758,"Thank you, Eric.",179,,
1268,0.97,11169.758,11177.499,"So deputy clerk, do I need to open and close the public hearing?",179,,
1269,0.97,11177.499,11178.767,"Yes, chair.",180,,
1270,0.97,11178.767,11179.468,Thank you.,180,,
1271,0.97,11179.468,11181.803,I will do that.,181,,

1274,0.97,11187.543,11198.353,I'm being told we do not have speakers signed up for this public hearing today.,181,,
1275,0.97,11198.353,11199.521,Is that still the case?,181,,
1276,0.97,11199.521,11202.391,There are no public hearing registrants.,182,,
1277,0.97,11202.391,11203.191,Okay.,183,,

1279,0.97,11203.492,11207.863,At this time we don't have anyone present to speak.,183,,
1280,0.97,11207.863,11221.71,"So we have confirmed nobody is on the line, and we'll go ahead and close the public comment period on bill 120045.",183,,

1286,0.97,11260.582,11283.405,"Because it's now 12:40, and we want to get to the last item on the agenda, which is more time sensitive, we are going to go ahead and if the committee has no objections, we'll amend the agenda to hold this to another committee meeting.",183,,
1287,0.97,11283.405,11293.482,"On the Internet for all action plan update, which is Online and we are excited about the progress that's been made.",183,,
1288,0.97,11293.482,11321.443,"I really want to thank our information technology Department and staff and the Council members who signed onto that resolution which led to the action plan, which now we're getting an update on.",183,,
1289,0.97,11321.443,11322.11,That's available Online.,183,,
1290,0.97,11322.11,11326.515,Please look at the agenda to see the progress that's been made.,183,,
1291,0.97,11326.515,11338.827,I'm focused on getting that Digital dashboard so we can start to measure the progress toward the goal of getting access to everybody in Seattle.,183,,
1292,0.97,11338.827,11341.063,"Council members, we're going to hold this item.",183,,
1293,0.97,11341.063,11347.936,"If there are any questions or comments you wanted to make on the Internet for all, feel free.",183,,
1294,0.97,11347.936,11359.381,We'll bring the it folks back at a time we have more time.,183,,
1295,0.97,11359.815,11364.453,Special thanks for your work on this.,183,,
1296,0.97,11364.453,11372.461,"Council members, we'll read the last item into the record.",183,,
1297,0.97,11372.461,11392.514,"Agenda item six, council bill 120043, ordinance relating to cable television, authorizing the Mayor or Mayor's Designee to approve the transfer of control subject to conditions.",184,,
1298,0.97,11392.514,11404.659,So this SEEKS approval of a transfer of controlling interest in the Cable agreement between the city of Seattle and wave division 1 due to a corporate merger that occurred.,185,,
1299,0.97,11404.659,11415.17,So this is required that it come to the Council to approve this change.,185,,
1300,0.97,11415.17,11435.056,"So we have Eric to kick it off, and have technology folks with us.",185,,
1301,0.97,11435.056,11435.49,Thank you.,186,,
1302,0.97,11435.49,11451.039,"Eric and staff, just briefly, as you mentioned, chair Peterson, the Federal rules Requirethat this process happen and be approved by the city council.",186,,
1303,0.97,11451.039,11459.381,A lot of work went into getting to this point.,186,,
1304,0.97,11459.381,11470.659,You mentioned a series of steps that have happened.,186,,
1305,0.97,11470.659,11486.241,I think well touch on those in this presentation.,186,,
1306,0.97,11486.241,11488.41,We are looking at people and communications.,187,,
1307,0.97,11488.41,11503.258,"A lot of people are not familiar with our work but we enforce the city's Cable code, code 2160.",187,,
1308,0.97,11503.258,11518.94,The bill before you today relates to a Cable franchise which operates in the central business district.,187,,
1309,0.97,11518.94,11536.591,The key facts around this the legislation are that there's a proposed transfer of equity interest relating to a corporate parent.,187,,
1310,0.97,11536.591,11541.096,That triggers a review to be sure there's no impact locally.,187,,
1311,0.97,11541.096,11557.479,"The second key fact, we have confirmed wave will remain the franchisee.",187,,
1312,0.97,11557.479,11574.029,"And in today's legislation, Seattle it does complete a significant review of the transfer to make sure the city's interests are protected and customers' interests are protected.",187,,
1313,0.97,11574.029,11584.072,We have a recommendation subject to a corporate decree.,187,,
1314,0.97,11584.072,11592.18,These kind of transfers are heavily influenced by Federal and city law.,187,,
1315,0.97,11592.18,11631.886,"Under federal law, when a transfer is applied to through the FCC, we have the opportunity as a local franchise holder to be sure the ownership of the franchise that we have with the private company is not being impacted in a negative way.",187,,
1316,0.97,11633.088,11641.396,We've got a 30-day extension to review the Agreed-To clock to meet the approval.,187,,
1317,0.97,11641.396,11657.112,"Under the city code as well as Federal code, we have in our ordinance, again to protect always the oversight on private operators and impact it has on the services provided in our community, a review of these kind of transfers.",187,,
1318,0.97,11657.112,11682.537,"So we look at the financial, legal and technical qualifications of somebody who's going to be having an impact on the ownership of a franchise.",187,,
1319,0.97,11682.537,11696.117,That's what we're presenting today.,187,,
1320,0.97,11696.117,11715.336,It's confirmed this change is really a change in a high level equity interest in a parent company of wave but wave remains the Grantee and responsible party under the franchise.,187,,
1321,0.97,11715.336,11730.919,The legal review recommended that the investor at the high level has the financial capability necessary to take on this transfer.,187,,
1322,0.97,11730.919,11739.194,It did highlight there's this equity Overshift that could increase debt.,187,,
1323,0.97,11739.194,11741.996,So the recommendation is a corporate guarantee.,187,,
1324,0.97,11741.996,11763.785,There's no Disinvestment on the local services as a result of this.,187,,
1325,0.97,11763.785,11773.328,This will be behind wave to continue their operations and have the technical ability to operate the system.,187,,
1326,0.97,11773.328,11802.29,"The outcome of our review is that Council would approve this transfer of control, knowing that the current level of service and system operations for our residents are going to we'll guarantee that by having the entity of the holdings and know they have the money to ensure the performance of wave under the franchise.",187,,
1327,0.97,11802.29,11822.71,"And we have a consent agreement that they will keep their system up to date and reimburse the city for expenses we had associated with this review, and the transfer will not result in an increase for customers.",187,,
1328,0.97,11822.71,11830.151,"If the agreement is not signed, the city's consent to this agreement would be null and void.",187,,
1329,0.97,11830.151,11831.753,I'll take any questions you have.,187,,
1330,0.97,11831.753,11832.554,"Thank you, Alice.",188,,
1331,0.97,11832.554,11854.642,I want to thank you for your oversight of this process and making sure that we have the financial and legal backup to come up with these best practices and corporate agreement and consent decree to protect city residents.,188,,
1332,0.97,11854.642,11868.59,I want to thank you for that savvy work that you have done for this legislation.,188,,
1333,0.97,11868.59,11871.426,Any questions about this?,188,,
1334,0.97,11871.426,11871.96,Okay.,188,,
1335,0.97,11871.96,11880.969,"Council members, I would like to move that the committee recommend approval of bill 120043, item six, the last item on the agenda.",188,,
1336,0.97,11880.969,11881.603,Is there a second?,188,,
1337,0.97,11881.603,11882.337,Second.,189,,
