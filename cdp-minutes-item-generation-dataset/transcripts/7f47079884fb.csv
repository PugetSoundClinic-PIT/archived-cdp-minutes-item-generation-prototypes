39,0.97,224.257,240.373,I think this is going to be a helpful Primer on the budget that we are releasing so we can have conversations about any possible amendments you are going to be considering by this Friday.,4,,

48,0.97,295.161,305.772,"Obviously we will continue do work to make sure the Timelines are more ideal but unlike the state Legislature that has a legislative body that receives about 4 months to work through their proposed budget, we have a total of 8 weeks.",4,,

66,0.97,429.796,450.316,"It's our incredible central staff team that through the leadership of director handy, deserves a Shout-Out and really a tremendous amount of thanks to Dan Eater and Tom and Lisa K and ally for all the work they have done to help scrub this budget to identify any possible revenue source given the decrease in revenue announcement that we heard last Wednesday.",4,,

68,0.97,454.554,456.556,And in the central staff presentation.,4,,
69,0.97,456.556,462.461,"I want to thank the Department staff and then--throughout the city, who have been working very hard.",4,,

77,0.97,529.328,542.708,Clearly we do need to continue to tell the story of what we are doing in this budget to make sure that any misinformation out there or misunderstanding are clearly understood and we look forward to working with you to make that possible.,4,,
78,0.97,542.708,551.617,"In addition to that, central staff has been providing very helpful tutorials and Overviews, informational Graphics so that people understand what is included in the proposed budget.",4,,
79,0.97,551.617,557.123,And we will be sharing more information about what is included in this chair's balancing package.,4,,
80,0.97,557.123,558.824,And finally I'd like toe thank my team.,4,,
81,0.97,558.824,566.832,Everybody in our team who's been working with us to try to Fnalize this proposed budget.,4,,
82,0.97,566.832,589.822,"Lori may hue, Aretha and Erin house and Cecil and to all of your teams and especially your budget leads who's been working around the clock as well to make sure that your amendments were shared on time and that we have the opportunity here directly from you why increases or decreases were propose requested the importance for helping to get the city into a more equitable.",4,,
83,0.97,589.822,591.457,Just healthy and safe place.,4,,
84,0.97,591.457,604.87,"As we get into this budget deliberation, and have an opportunity to work with you to understand what's in the proposed budget in front of us, I'd like to start with correcting some misinformation that's out there regarding the Council's balancing package in front of us today.",4,,
85,0.97,604.87,614.313,Our city and I are not going to edge gauge in tactics to pit historically marginalized and disenfranchised communities against each other.,4,,
86,0.97,614.313,616.415,We cannot do that.,4,,
87,0.97,616.415,618.851,"Not now, not while we're in the midst of a pandemic.",4,,
88,0.97,618.851,623.656,Not while families are on the brink of their losing their homes.,4,,
89,0.97,623.656,631.664,Not now when we are seeing so many for families and Kiddos not be able to have food Securities and families wonder whether or not there'll be food on the table.,4,,
90,0.97,631.664,635.601,Our most vulnerable need to have care and comfort.,4,,
91,0.97,635.601,656.889,"That is why our proposed budget Srubbed every single Department to look for any funding that was possibly available if there was funding that was going to be sitting on the shelf and not put to use immediately, we wanted to use those dollars to make sure that we were caring and comforting the most vulnerable and investing in workers, small businesses, and creating a more just economy.",4,,
92,0.97,656.889,663.629,I'd like to start at the front end by making sure that we address this misinformation to provide the full picture.,4,,
93,0.97,663.629,678.444,"And in our city, we must make sure that we invest in direct services to families, small businesses, and to make sure that our most vulnerable have what they need, we are still in the midst of a pandemic.",4,,
94,0.97,678.444,687.72,Small businesses are continuing to close while the office of economic development is sitting on millions of dollars still allocated from the Seattle rescue plan that have not been spent.,4,,
95,0.97,687.72,699.265,Now is the time where we need to get every dollar that the city has allocated in the past and every dollar available in 2022 out the door to families who are on the brink of losing their homes.,4,,
96,0.97,699.265,702.168,Who are worried about whether or not they will pay rent.,4,,
97,0.97,702.168,709.408,Who are concerned that they are not Proked--they will not be able to provide for their families.,4,,
98,0.97,709.408,710.743,That's what our responsibility was.,4,,
99,0.97,710.743,715.548,Many of our families are still dealing with the loss from Covid.,4,,
100,0.97,715.548,724.123,"Loss of health, loss of life, loss of friendship, loss of their livelihoods.",4,,
101,0.97,724.123,724.623,Loss of their housing.,4,,
102,0.97,724.623,729.261,We needed to make sure that we reject any fear stoking and division and hate.,4,,
103,0.97,729.261,732.164,Let me address the elephant in the room with the truth.,4,,
104,0.97,732.164,740.106,The reality is that this budget had about a $15 million shortfall that we had to accommodate for last Wednesday.,4,,
105,0.97,740.106,748.08,"Knowing the tremendous need that's out there, central staff and I scoured the budget and looked at every corner of the proposed budget that was transmitted by the Mayor.",4,,
106,0.97,748.08,751.917,We looked at every single Department to see where funding was available.,4,,
107,0.97,751.917,760.392,So that we did not have funding sitting in coffers waiting on shelves in 2022 that could be instead used immediately.,4,,
108,0.97,760.392,762.595,Every Department received the same level of scrutiny.,4,,
109,0.97,762.595,771.871,Every Department had the same litmus test of whether or not there was general fund dollars that we could use to get out the door in this moment of need.,4,,
110,0.97,771.871,795.961,"I want to also be very clear that while Seattle police Department is an area that everyone is interested in and we continue to want to make sure that we are investing in upstream solutions to reduce the chance that any individual ends up in the criminal justice system, we made sure that the full hiring plan as proposed by the Mayor is included in this budget.",4,,
111,0.97,795.961,800.099,The full hiring plan as proposed by the Mayor is in the budget.,4,,
112,0.97,800.099,804.937,We also assume the same level of attrition that we assume last year.,4,,
113,0.97,804.937,811.944,Recognizing that there was still more officers who were leaving this year than we assumed and we didn't increase that amount.,4,,
114,0.97,811.944,818.918,The same number of officers who left last year in our assumptions in the budget are also included here.,4,,
115,0.97,818.918,836.502,"This budget uses that salary savings that would otherwise sit on a shelf so that we can invest in food, in housing, in gun violence reduction measures, in mental health investments, in making sure that we had housed and safe communities so that no dollar was sat on a shelf and just waiting.",4,,
116,0.97,836.502,845.878,It's an easy talking point to say that we're cutting a budget of a department but it is more important to look at the details.,4,,
117,0.97,845.878,851.083,Not every single one of those dollars was going into existing programs.,4,,
118,0.97,851.083,853.285,Some were proposed for new investments.,4,,
119,0.97,853.285,864.697,It is a important reminder for us that this is a tough part of our budget decisions when we have reductions in revenue that we must account for.,4,,
120,0.97,864.697,880.212,"But I don't think that is responsible to invest in new technologies that might be nice to have, such as monitoring heart rates in a moment where we know that the heart rates of families and individuals who are suffering right now are increasing because they're worried about whether or not they're going to keep their home.",4,,
121,0.97,880.212,882.481,They're worried about whether or not they can seek shelter and services.,4,,
122,0.97,882.481,886.952,And that is where we need some decisions to try to free up dollars.,4,,
123,0.97,886.952,889.421,That would otherwise be unspent next year.,4,,
124,0.97,889.421,900.633,"We Lo go into every Department but I want to make sure folks know at the front end, $27 million is going into community safety and stability investments.",4,,
125,0.97,900.633,912.678,"Our own Nick Junior report said that today, 12% of the calls going to 911 and being deployed to SPD should be handled by someone else rather than an armed officer with a gun.",4,,
126,0.97,912.678,916.982,That is the analysis from the Mayor's own team.,4,,
127,0.97,916.982,920.119,That 12% of the calls coming in today could be redirected.,4,,
128,0.97,920.119,938.804,"We have made decisions to try to free up the opportunity for officers to respond to the most urgent calls while making sure that there is a well Resourced alternative system that includes mental health providers, case managers, and other first responders that don't require a badge and gun.",4,,
129,0.97,938.804,941.206,I look forward to having the conversation with you all.,4,,
130,0.97,941.206,943.742,We can get into those details too soon.,4,,
131,0.97,943.742,948.847,I know that you too are tired of misinformation.,4,,
132,0.97,948.847,954.253,Our duty as Council members during the budget is to address the $15 million shortfall.,4,,
133,0.97,954.253,956.722,That we at the same time invested in our city's future.,4,,
134,0.97,956.722,964.33,While we invested in the trauma our city has faced due to Covid.,4,,
135,0.97,964.33,971.737,"As our vice chair continually said, the--shadow pandemic of trauma and Additioal stress in our communities cannot go Unaddressed in this budget.",4,,
136,0.97,971.737,977.943,"And that will help create healthier, more stable communities and local economies in the long run.",4,,
137,0.97,977.943,988.921,Also make sure to highlight the investment that is we made in protecting the vast majority of dollars going into the--stabilization funds.,4,,
138,0.97,988.921,993.392,"While it was suggested to us we drain the revenue to $3 million last year, I'm glad we didn't do that.",4,,
139,0.97,993.392,1002.701,What we have in front of us is unprecedented situation where a city must plan for unforeseen economic Downtowns.,4,,
140,0.97,1002.701,1010.776,This year's downturn was not in large part due Jump-Start despite in information shared over the last two days.,4,,
141,0.97,1010.776,1020.019,The vast majority of reductions we saw to the proposed forecasts were directly related to commercial parking tags.,4,,
142,0.97,1020.019,1040.139,It's unfortunate an assumption was made that commercial parking would rebound to normal rates starting on January 1ST next year when we know that return to work measures have continued to be delayed we're going to be everything we can in the budget to also prepare for any additional decreases in the Jump-Start suggested funding.,4,,
143,0.97,1040.139,1049.615,"But this year's revenue forecast that we've received last week only decreased our assumed revenue from Jump-Start by $750,000.",4,,
144,0.97,1049.615,1052.05,So we have a $15 million shortfall.,4,,
145,0.97,1052.05,1058.724,We have absolutely tried to do everything we can with the good news we received with Reed.,4,,
146,0.97,1058.724,1069.234,But there's still a $15 million shortfall in the revenue that we have and we have tremendous need and incredibly great ideas from Councilmen that is we wanted to accommodate for.,4,,
147,0.97,1069.234,1077.142,"As you will recall, in September, I along with many of you, raised a question about the Mayor's use of a baseline revenue forecast.",4,,
148,0.97,1077.142,1083.449,"Well, the ongoing Covid-19 emergency was proving that this could be a longer than projected downturn.",4,,
149,0.97,1083.449,1091.056,We asked questions about whether or not there should be the use of the pessimistic forecast and that Foreshadowing has come true.,4,,
150,0.97,1091.056,1111.577,"With dealing with this $15 million forecast, we then went into our proposed budget looked at all of the amendments that you all have submitted, and and made some important and I think--timely decisions about how existing revenue could be used to help shelter, house, feed, and care for our community.",4,,
151,0.97,1111.577,1117.316,I look forward to having conversation with you this afternoon about all of those decisions that we have included in the proposed budget.,4,,
152,0.97,1117.316,1124.123,I thank you for the ideas that you have put forward because there was so many overlapping themes because we all see so many overlapping needs.,4,,
153,0.97,1124.123,1127.259,I want to end with some good news.,4,,
154,0.97,1127.259,1135.367,The good news is that the city's fiscal health and prognosis does remain strong.,4,,
155,0.97,1135.367,1138.77,The N. O. taxes and real estate excise taxes are increasing.,4,,
156,0.97,1138.77,1141.206,Thanks goodness we used the dollars for rate specific purposes.,4,,
157,0.97,1141.206,1147.479,We have very high vaccination rates compared to other places across the country.,4,,
158,0.97,1147.479,1156.488,"Seattle's office rent increases--excuse me, the renting of office space in Seattle continues to increase relative to other places across the country.",4,,
159,0.97,1156.488,1166.331,"And we were able to again, thank you to central staff, we were able to be able to make investments in Council priorities to the tune of $70 million.",4,,
160,0.97,1166.331,1172.237,I want to make sure that folks know that there's a caveat and a caution with those investments.,4,,
161,0.97,1172.237,1178.176,The vast majority of these investments do include one-time funding opportunities.,4,,
162,0.97,1178.176,1190.656,I think that is an appropriate use of one-time funding in the midst of a pandemic to try to Jump-Start the economy by Infusing the dollars and we also have to recognize the dollars are short-term in nature.,4,,
163,0.97,1190.656,1199.298,"And many are attributed to the additional support that we've received from the Arpa funds, from FEMA funds and other one- time funds.",4,,
164,0.97,1199.298,1216.415,We have made a--I think important and correct effort here to maintain our--largely maintain our reserves to maintain FEMA and to make sure that we had stability in the sweetened beverage tax.,4,,
165,0.97,1216.415,1238.437,I look forward to working with you as we continue to try to support additional progressive revenue to maintain those city services but the work that you have done to ensure that Jump- start funds go into Jump-Start priorities means that we now have guaranteed that that implementation plan will be adhered Toby the budget.,4,,
166,0.97,1238.437,1240.539,The conversation here wouldn't be possible without the contribution of Jump-Start.,4,,
167,0.97,1240.539,1241.74,That's the put it mildly.,4,,
168,0.97,1241.74,1250.983,We would be in a much worse situation if we didn't have the revenue--that we are counting on from Jump-Start.,4,,
169,0.97,1250.983,1275.34,And we have done Jump-Start in the midst of seeing record numbers of start up high-tech firms coming to Seattle and we welcome them and we're excited and we also want to make sure we are using the payroll tax to invest in an economy to also address increases in income inequality that's come with a 21% in the increase of the population over the last ten years.,4,,
170,0.97,1275.34,1289.254,Jump-Start simultaneously created flexibility and stability and accountability by creating a fund so we can share what money is coming in and where it is going and allow for those dollars to be infused into Seattle's local economy now.,4,,
171,0.97,1289.254,1291.323,And support our most vulnerable.,4,,
172,0.97,1291.323,1311.476,"The biggest item I will note is that in these trying times, because of Jump-Start's investment, because of the work you have done, colleagues, and community, there's now $192 million in this proposed budget to create new permanently affordable housing and rental housing.",4,,
173,0.97,1311.476,1314.212,$192Million for community focused acquisition and home ownership opportunities and affordable rentals.,4,,
174,0.97,1314.212,1322.12,This is a historic amount of investments made because of the $97 million we have put into affordable housing through Jump- start.,4,,
175,0.97,1322.12,1327.993,This is nearly twice--almost twice the amount of housing investments that we have seen over the last four years.,4,,
176,0.97,1327.993,1331.596,So I want to thank you for the work that you have done.,4,,
177,0.97,1331.596,1331.997,With Jump-Start.,4,,
178,0.97,1331.997,1337.202,"And with the proposed amendments in front of us, we are investing in child care.",4,,
179,0.97,1337.202,1337.703,In small businesses.,4,,
180,0.97,1337.703,1340.672,In culturally appropriate services.,4,,
181,0.97,1340.672,1341.94,In home ownership opportunities.,4,,
182,0.97,1341.94,1342.708,In building generational wealth.,4,,
183,0.97,1342.708,1346.178,In caring for our most vulnerable.,4,,
184,0.97,1346.178,1355.587,In addressing past discriminatory zoning policies and creating investments in human infrastructure as well as the capital infrastructure necessary to care for and connect our communities.,4,,
185,0.97,1355.587,1362.594,So with that I will have some more thank Yous when we get into this overview of the amendments that Council members have put together.,4,,
186,0.97,1362.594,1376.074,But that's the ground setting that I'd like to set as I hand it over to director handy to walk us through summary of the resources and how we got here.,4,,
187,0.97,1376.074,1381.279,"Okay, thank you so much chair Mosqueda.",5,,
188,0.97,1381.279,1382.147,"Esther handy, council central staff.",5,,
189,0.97,1382.147,1412.177,And let's go ahead and pull up the slides and I'm going to start with just a high level--Recap of some of the process pieces and then we'll walk through the--revenue forecast and resources used for this budget before handing it to my colleague ally Panucci to walk through the investments in this budget.,5,,
190,0.97,1412.177,1412.677,So next slide.,5,,
191,0.97,1412.677,1417.249,The previous one is a good Recap of our budget process.,5,,
192,0.97,1417.249,1423.388,But it highlights our first three steps in the process which you have already been through.,5,,
193,0.97,1423.388,1426.491,Departments came and presented the 2022 proposed budget.,5,,
194,0.97,1426.491,1427.726,You had a public hearing.,5,,
195,0.97,1427.726,1434.065,Central staff presented issues that they have identified in this budget for your discussion.,5,,
196,0.97,1434.065,1436.201,And then October 26th to 28.,5,,
197,0.97,1436.201,1438.303,You all proposed amendments to the budget.,5,,
198,0.97,1438.303,1450.682,Today we are going to walk through the balancing package including amendments that were all those amendments that were included in the package were discussed in phase three.,5,,
199,0.97,1450.682,1460.258,Some have been scaled or altered as your discussions evolved but we will be continuing to discuss with the public today.,5,,
200,0.97,1460.258,1460.592,Next slide.,5,,
201,0.97,1460.592,1461.259,As the chair mentions tonight.,5,,
202,0.97,1461.259,1464.763,You will have a chance to hear from the public about this.,5,,
203,0.97,1464.763,1468.834,And we will be back in Committee on Friday.,5,,
204,0.97,1468.834,1469.234,And next slide.,5,,
205,0.97,1469.234,1480.745,"Next week, you will have a chance to--these are the dates highlighted by the chair where you will have a chance to discuss and vote on amendments to this package.",5,,
206,0.97,1480.745,1483.548,To get to a final budget.,5,,
207,0.97,1483.548,1490.388,Any questions about process from Council members before I proceed?,5,,
208,0.97,1490.388,1491.523,Not seeing any director.,6,,
209,0.97,1491.523,1493.892,"Oh excuse me, vice chair Herbold.",6,,
210,0.97,1493.892,1494.86,Please go ahead.,6,,
211,0.97,1494.86,1496.161,Thank you so much.,7,,
212,0.97,1496.161,1534.933,"Just wanted to follow up on the comments that you made Madame chair, about the fact that the revenue forecast was--resulted in a significant--well, I should say the Mayor's proposed budget being built on a revenue forecast that was insufficiently pessimistic is resulting in us the Council having to find additional revenue to address that shortfall.",7,,
213,0.97,1534.933,1548.58,I'm just wondering--I know we had a really robust budget discussion with budget director noble when he came in and presented the revenue assumptions to Council.,7,,
214,0.97,1548.58,1554.119,He was very transparent about the fact that the budget was going to be built.,7,,
215,0.97,1554.119,1564.062,The budget was going to be built on a--particular set of revenue assumptions.,7,,
216,0.97,1564.062,1568.466,And several of us spoke at that point to our concerns.,7,,
217,0.97,1568.466,1569.601,With that approach.,7,,
218,0.97,1569.601,1579.01,And what that would result in if it turned out that those presumptions or assumptions were overly optimistic.,7,,
219,0.97,1579.01,1588.486,And so my question is do we have--is there a--is there an option that we as the Council.,7,,
220,0.97,1588.486,1627.692,"In the future, having learned from the particular situation, is there something that the Council can do to direct that the budget be built on particular set of assumptions, perhaps that's one of the--happy outcomes that might be able to be realized from the--the economic forecasting staff that we--that under Council President Gonzalez's leadership together with chair Mosqueda, that we are going to have in place for--for future budget processes?",7,,
221,0.97,1627.692,1634.799,That just wondering who our captions are in the future to make sure that we're not in this position again.,7,,
222,0.97,1634.799,1638.303,I'm happy to respond to that.,8,,
223,0.97,1638.303,1639.471,"And ally, fill in any details that I Miss.",8,,
224,0.97,1639.471,1650.515,"I will say you know this summer, the Council adopted--passed an ordinance to create a new independent office of economic and revenue forecasting.",8,,
225,0.97,1650.515,1658.423,That office is currently being stood up so the process to hire a director and with the plan for it to be operational in 2022.,8,,
226,0.97,1658.423,1661.426,And do the revenue forecasting for the city.,8,,
227,0.97,1661.426,1666.664,That forecast office will report to a forecast Council that is made up of two Council members.,8,,
228,0.97,1666.664,1671.236,The Council president and the chair of the Finance Committee.,8,,
229,0.97,1671.236,1672.771,Two folks on the executive side.,8,,
230,0.97,1672.771,1676.975,The Mayor and the director of city finance or their delegates.,8,,
231,0.97,1676.975,1688.453,And the intention is that the independent office prepares a revenue forecast that goes to the forecast Council to make decisions about what baseline is used.,8,,
232,0.97,1688.453,1697.228,So that independent body accountable to elects on both the executive and the legislative side making decisions in public about which forecast to use.,8,,
233,0.97,1697.228,1704.803,So we do expect to change in policy set by the Council for 2022.,8,,
234,0.97,1704.803,1705.336,Thank you so much.,9,,
235,0.97,1705.336,1709.808,We will talk about the details to have revenue forecast in more detail shortly.,10,,
236,0.97,1709.808,1717.248,I do want to take a quick second to again thank the Council president for her leadership and her work on that.,11,,
237,0.97,1717.248,1720.285,Thank you Council member Herbold for asking that question.,11,,
238,0.97,1720.285,1725.256,And recognizing that the Mayor's office creates their budget over a five month period.,11,,
239,0.97,1725.256,1728.993,Versus us being able to respond in an eight week period.,11,,
240,0.97,1728.993,1741.74,"By the time we learned in September, that they were assuming the--baseline forecast versus what I think all of us cautioned against, they needed to be using the pessimistic forecast.",11,,
241,0.97,1741.74,1746.311,"I'm assuming they had built in--excuse me, I was going to say hundreds of thousands.",11,,
242,0.97,1746.311,1751.116,Probably a few million extra dollars more than they should have by using that assumption.,11,,
243,0.97,1751.116,1766.03,"That in addition to using the assumption that parking downtown would rebound in January, seems to have--seems to me like it could have been forecasted in a different way.",11,,
244,0.97,1766.03,1766.631,Especially around parking.,11,,
245,0.97,1766.631,1781.346,So I want to thank the Council president for the work that she's done and I want to thank central staff and Tom and others who have been working on that proposal with us over the last few years.,11,,
246,0.97,1781.346,1789.287,"And I think if--there was a question about how we could readdress that or redirect them to use a different assumption, that is my hope with that new body to come.",11,,
247,0.97,1789.287,1798.963,So thanks again for raising that.,11,,
248,0.97,1798.963,1800.165,Then I'll continue.,11,,
249,0.97,1800.165,1801.266,In the next slide.,11,,
250,0.97,1801.266,1809.774,"In the initial Id discussion, sorry, the topic--move forward.",12,,
251,0.97,1809.774,1810.074,It's great.,12,,
252,0.97,1810.074,1810.375,Thank you.,12,,
253,0.97,1810.375,1821.252,This is the pieces we're going to walk for and I'll talk about the forecast and then we'll talk about proposed changes.,12,,
254,0.97,1821.252,1825.657,So inner issue Id discussion.,12,,
255,0.97,1825.657,1830.695,Next slide.,12,,
256,0.97,1830.695,1831.963,That came to the Council.,12,,
257,0.97,1831.963,1844.042,"We discussed as the baseline even cut prior the Covid-19 pandemic, the cost of ongoing general fund services have been growing outpacing revenue growth.",12,,
258,0.97,1844.042,1856.788,"We knew that without action by the Council in '22, in 2020 to pass in Jump-Start funding bill, and provide new--source of Progressive revenue, this would be an all cuts budget.",12,,
259,0.97,1856.788,1873.071,"The Mayor balanced her proposed budget using one-time Federal resources that are also utilized in this package and two, by applying $148 million of revenue from the Jump-Start fund which is $62 million higher than allowed by current policy.",12,,
260,0.97,1873.071,1879.344,And would have reduced the capacity of the Jump-Start fund to support programs in a like amount in 2023 and beyond.,12,,
261,0.97,1879.344,1884.582,We've discussed this quite a bit in the budget committee.,12,,
262,0.97,1884.582,1900.164,"And in addition that the budget included $70 million of ongoing funding for equitable community initiative priority projects, Participatory budgeting and community safety, community led investments.",12,,
263,0.97,1900.164,1904.702,"Many, perhaps all of these projects are supported by this Council.",12,,
264,0.97,1904.702,1913.278,But came absent an ongoing revenue source or equitable funding strategy to support them over the long-term.,12,,
265,0.97,1913.278,1914.345,Next slide.,12,,
266,0.97,1914.345,1922.153,"And so then as discussed, last week on Wednesday, November 3RD, the city budget office provided their final economic and revenue forecast of the year.",12,,
267,0.97,1922.153,1925.523,As they do each November in the stage of the budget process.,12,,
268,0.97,1925.523,1934.866,And as just discussed this process will be changing for 2022.,12,,
269,0.97,1934.866,1939.437,That forecast showed the 2022 budget couldn't be fully funded as proposed.,12,,
270,0.97,1939.437,1945.209,Specifically the forecast showed a projected decrease of general revenue of $15 million.,12,,
271,0.97,1945.209,1952.116,This is largely driven by delays in return to work due to increase in Delta variant case this is fall that impacted the payroll expense tax.,12,,
272,0.97,1952.116,1960.124,The sales tax and parking fines in 2021.,12,,
273,0.97,1960.124,1966.364,Partially offset by the Uptick in the business and occupation tax.,12,,
274,0.97,1966.364,1971.269,Creating that net $15 million decrease in projected general fund revenues.,12,,
275,0.97,1971.269,1990.188,"Outside the general Fund, the forecast projected a net $19 million decrease in other funds including an $8.4 million decrease in the commercial parking tax, due to fewer people visiting the downtown core for work and commercial activity.",12,,
276,0.97,1990.188,1997.562,$4.5Million decrease to the sweetened beverage tax and an increase to school zone camera revenues again for a $19 million decrease in other funds.,12,,
277,0.97,1997.562,2000.164,Can I stop you for a minute?,13,,
278,0.97,2000.164,2003.034,What was the last one?,13,,
279,0.97,2003.034,2008.006,"I heard the--parking and sugar tax, what was the last one.",13,,
280,0.97,2008.006,2012.443,The school zone camera revenue is actually up by $5 million.,14,,
281,0.97,2012.443,2012.71,Okay.,15,,
282,0.97,2012.71,2012.944,Thanks.,15,,
283,0.97,2012.944,2013.177,Yep.,16,,
284,0.97,2013.177,2020.885,In the general fund there's 20 different funding sources that come together to total that net $15 million decrease.,16,,
285,0.97,2020.885,2023.187,In the other funds I think there are seven or so.,16,,
286,0.97,2023.187,2031.295,And then the largest bright spot in the revenue forecast is a $26 million Uptick in real estate excise tax.,16,,
287,0.97,2031.295,2039.203,This is a result of a--continuing to have a hot both residential and commercial real estate market in the city.,16,,
288,0.97,2039.203,2051.115,"And so before any other actions were taken on this budget, this balancing package had to address the projected losses in revenues to come into balance.",16,,
289,0.97,2051.115,2060.024,"Next, I'll move to the resources to set up this balancing package unless there are additional questions on the forecast.",16,,
290,0.97,2060.024,2061.526,Any additional questions?,17,,
291,0.97,2061.526,2064.028,Thank you Esther.,17,,
292,0.97,2064.028,2066.13,Thank you director handy for summarizing that.,17,,
293,0.97,2066.13,2069.1,And again--we received that information only a week ago.,17,,
294,0.97,2069.1,2071.569,Less than a week ago since it was in the evening on Wednesday.,17,,
295,0.97,2071.569,2088.853,So thank you to central staff for all of the work that you have done to really Deconstruct that updated forecast and to make sure that any errors were addressed and noted and that we have fully accounted for how to close that gap in this budget.,17,,
296,0.97,2088.853,2089.153,Great.,18,,
297,0.97,2089.153,2093.424,So next you all got to work to address those shortfalls.,18,,
298,0.97,2093.424,2097.261,And the issues underlying the proposed budget.,18,,
299,0.97,2097.261,2101.766,You identified areas where spending could be cut or where funding did not align with Council priorities.,18,,
300,0.97,2101.766,2121.619,And so the next two slides I will walk through are those resources that are being used to address the shortfall and to fund Council member additions to the proposed budget.,18,,
301,0.97,2191.989,2199.664,We'll talk about later is scheduled to be stood up in 2022.,18,,
302,0.97,2199.664,2201.699,These are unspent 2021 funds.,18,,
303,0.97,2201.699,2212.677,It--it removes the balance of reserves for Covid vaccination programs that are in sort of full swing in 2021.,18,,
304,0.97,2212.677,2220.084,And Redeploys some Clifford funding for rapid Rehousing for similar programs next year.,18,,
305,0.97,2220.084,2221.986,So $8.7 million in 2021.,18,,
306,0.97,2221.986,2233.998,The next is the chair's Omni bus amendment as we have discussed it which restores Jump-Start funding and policy priorities to current policy adopted by ordinance previously.,18,,
307,0.97,2233.998,2241.706,The balancing package matches current policy by allowing $85 million of Jump-Start funds to be used to support the general fund broadly.,18,,
308,0.97,2241.706,2246.644,To preserve existing programs while tax revenues recover.,18,,
309,0.97,2246.644,2251.882,And invests $149 million in the defined Jump-Start policy priorities.,18,,
310,0.97,2251.882,2273.237,The majority going Participator Ensewer there's a total of $30 million available to each of the programs using a combination of unspent money in 2021 and new funding in 2022.,18,,
311,0.97,2273.237,2293.758,These adjustments are paired with a statement of legislative intent that the Council will work with the new executive to identify a progressive revenue source or an equitable funding strategy to support these programs in the future.,18,,
312,0.97,2293.758,2293.958,Next.,18,,
313,0.97,2293.958,2297.295,Third--cuts $4.4 million of Federal Clifford funding for the Seattle promise program.,18,,
314,0.97,2297.295,2309.173,And instead funds the program with $4.4 million of Underspend from the families' education preschool and promise levee what we call the Fep levee.,18,,
315,0.97,2309.173,2315.646,This maintains the proposed 2022 investment in the Seattle promise program from the Mayor.,18,,
316,0.97,2315.646,2318.683,The total Underspent is projected to be $4.4 million.,18,,
317,0.97,2318.683,2326.19,Thattures just a portion for $4.4 million of the funds and this action leaves $10 million in anodes nailed fund balance as a reserve.,18,,
318,0.97,2326.19,2333.931,To ensure the Sustainability of deal programs through the life of the levy as recommended by Fep oversight committee.,18,,
319,0.97,2333.931,2339.07,I want to underscore that point.,19,,
320,0.97,2339.07,2342.206,This retains the same amount in the Seattle promise program.,19,,
321,0.97,2342.206,2346.41,And it maintains the $10 million that the oversight committee had suggested that we hold back.,19,,
322,0.97,2346.41,2349.714,Just in case there's any confusion about that out there.,19,,
323,0.97,2349.714,2356.02,Want to make sure we underscored that point.,19,,
324,0.97,2356.02,2358.089,Thank you very much director.,19,,
325,0.97,2358.089,2360.424,Great.,20,,
326,0.97,2360.424,2366.13,Next is a reduction of $1.4 million of Clifford funds in the I. T. Department.,20,,
327,0.97,2366.13,2379.009,The Seattle rescue plan one added $2.3 million to Idt in 2021 to provide additional short-term support for the most In-Demand lines of business.,20,,
328,0.97,2379.009,2384.181,The 2022 proposed budget included $4 million to continue that work for another 12 months.,20,,
329,0.97,2384.181,2396.494,This action would reduce the funding to continue that work for about seven and a half rather than 12 months.,20,,
330,0.97,2396.494,2411.509,"Next, the balancing package reduces contributions to the revenue stabilization fund by 1.5 million dollars.",20,,
331,0.97,2411.509,2412.243,One of the city's fiscal reserves.,20,,
332,0.97,2412.51,2419.116,Proposed path to restore the city's reserves on a five year time horizon to Pre-Pandemic levels.,20,,
333,0.97,2419.116,2432.563,"Then the last one on this table before we go to the next is a approximate $600,000 reduction to the I. Dt Department assuming a 6% vacancy rate rather than 4%.",20,,
334,0.97,2432.563,2436.534,Which better matches the current reality in that Department which is currently just north of 7%.,20,,
335,0.97,2436.534,2437.935,Thank you so much.,21,,
336,0.97,2437.935,2452.483,"Just as I noted at the beginning, every single Department was looked at to see if there was any money that was Overassuming any number of personnel that would not potentially be hired or any Underspend that we could potentially account for.",21,,
337,0.97,2452.483,2478.476,So this again I think and a good example all departments had the same level of scrutiny and we look for carefully to see if there was a justifiable reason to be able to make these types of reductions so we can use these resources and this down time and any questions on this slide?,21,,
338,0.97,2478.476,2478.676,Okay.,21,,
339,0.97,2478.676,2479.109,Thank you director.,21,,
340,0.97,2479.109,2479.41,Great.,22,,
341,0.97,2479.41,2479.944,Next.,22,,
342,0.97,2479.944,2488.752,"The--the next action is a reduction of $948,000 from the Seattle Department for triage one.",22,,
343,0.97,2488.752,2493.557,The triage one program is scheduled to hire staff between May and September of 2022.,22,,
344,0.97,2493.557,2499.73,And to be operational by end of year 2022 or early 2023.,22,,
345,0.97,2499.73,2502.833,So this action reduces funding for the first portion of the year.,22,,
346,0.97,2502.833,2509.94,And retains the core pieces of funding needed for the start-up process including hiring vehicles et cetera.,22,,
347,0.97,2509.94,2519.95,So a continued commitment to triage one capturing some savings that will not be spent in the longer Timeline stand up.,22,,
348,0.97,2519.95,2521.619,"Herbold, please go ahead.",23,,
349,0.97,2521.619,2526.59,Can you remind us what was originally proposed for 2022?,24,,
350,0.97,2526.59,2527.358,For triage one.,24,,
351,0.97,2527.358,2527.591,Yes.,25,,
352,0.97,2527.591,2528.559,And you know what?,25,,
353,0.97,2528.559,2531.962,I should have that number right at my fingertips and I don't quite.,25,,
354,0.97,2531.962,2541.305,Aisle just going to look to my team to see if another staff analyst does and if not I'll circle back to get that to you shortly.,25,,
355,0.97,2541.305,2552.483,"Mrs. Herbold, I believe that to add to the conversation, I'm not sure this directly answers you but the $700,000 that we just approved the last month is retained in the budget.",26,,
356,0.97,2552.483,2556.954,It's carrying over for the implementation and just want to make sure that was also clear.,26,,
357,0.97,2556.954,2557.288,I hope I --,26,,
358,0.97,2557.288,2561.225,That was going to be my second question.,27,,
359,0.97,2561.225,2563.561,So--thank you for anticipating.,27,,
360,0.97,2563.561,2573.237,"And--again, and I'm going to keep talking just in case central staff have additional comments they want to pop in.",28,,
361,0.97,2573.237,2578.876,And we have--every interest in seeing the triage one program be successful.,28,,
362,0.97,2578.876,2582.246,"As the Council's--excuse me, as vice chair, Herbold noted.",28,,
363,0.97,2582.246,2595.859,There's a lot of work that's currently happening right now to report on a protocol system for 911 dispatch that will be very informative along with some other work that's being done on how to best deploy the right first Responder.,28,,
364,0.97,2595.859,2608.405,"We understood from the presentation from the departments that triage one at the earliest, even though there was an announcement mid year this year, at the earliest the triage one program would be stood up is December of 2022.",28,,
365,0.97,2608.405,2619.35,So that is why we are assuming a use of resources here and it is not a cut to the program.,28,,
366,0.97,2619.35,2627.458,But basically capturing dollars that would have otherwise sat on a shelf and I'll stop there to see if central staff adds writing anything.,28,,
367,0.97,2627.458,2629.426,I think our colleagues have some additional information.,29,,
368,0.97,2629.426,2656.653,I want to clarify that the cuts to the year end supplemental did include cutting the funding for triage one that was--that was being held in finance general and has not yet been expended or requested to be moved so the package does include both the cuts on both sides and I believe Greg and perhaps Anne can talk a little bit more about the implementation plan for triage one in 2022.,29,,
369,0.97,2656.653,2661.992,I'm happy to talk about 2022.,30,,
370,0.97,2661.992,2671.301,The executive's proposed budget included full year funding starting on January 1ST of 2022 for the triage one unit.,30,,
371,0.97,2671.301,2681.011,But Sfd has subsequently provided information to us that suggests that they will not be able to launch that program until December of 2022.,30,,
372,0.97,2681.011,2681.478,Or January of 2023.,30,,
373,0.97,2681.478,2685.115,There's just a lot that needs to happen between now and then.,30,,
374,0.97,2685.115,2705.069,And just to expand a little bit on what Anne is saying when she says a lot needs to Hawaii one of the key things that needs to happen is negotiation with the Seattle police officer gild and local 27 on the transfer of the 911 calls that would go to triage one.,31,,
375,0.97,2705.069,2712.476,Away from fire and away from police to the civilians in triage one.,31,,
376,0.97,2712.476,2727.925,"And the labor implications along with those negotiations are not something that can happen quickly and according to the Timeline, that we have received from the executive, those discussions would not even begin until this spring.",31,,
377,0.97,2727.925,2730.16,"If I remember correctly, Anne.",31,,
378,0.97,2730.16,2733.664,"Yeah, that's correct.",32,,
379,0.97,2733.664,2744.174,And one other piece is that Sfd is anticipating the need to create a new job classification.,32,,
380,0.97,2744.174,2748.011,For the counselor who will staff triage one.,32,,
381,0.97,2748.011,2757.788,"When the city developed its classification, we were not sending the counselors out into the field to work side by side with first responders.",32,,
382,0.97,2757.788,2766.597,So acknowledging that the special work conditions that these counselors are engaged in compared to other Hsd counselors.,32,,
383,0.97,2766.597,2776.039,They like to negotiate a new job classification for that work.,32,,
384,0.97,2776.039,2778.876,"And so--again, just return to the original question.",33,,
385,0.97,2778.876,2785.782,How much was originally proposed in the 2022 budget for triage one?,33,,
386,0.97,2785.782,2786.216,$2.15 million.,34,,
387,0.97,2786.216,2786.884,Okay.,35,,
388,0.97,2786.884,2787.084,Okay.,35,,
389,0.97,2787.084,2787.384,Thank you.,35,,
390,0.97,2787.384,2805.469,"And I would love that information Anne, I have a--I have a Gant chart that I think if--from the fire Department, that I think has been shared with you from my staff that I come to a different conclusion.",35,,
391,0.97,2805.469,2810.641,But I don't have--the information that you have about what's going on right now.,35,,
392,0.97,2810.641,2811.375,So that might be why.,35,,
393,0.97,2811.375,2818.182,It shows a number of months to do a certain number of functions and it doesn't come down on a particular month in 2022.,35,,
394,0.97,2818.182,2830.26,"But if they are doing the things that they said back in September that they were working on, and you count out the number of months on this chart, it seems like they could launch in June.",35,,
395,0.97,2830.26,2838.735,"But perhaps the things that they promised they would be doing earlier this year, they have not yet begun and that might account for the difference.",35,,
396,0.97,2838.735,2844.775,I have--I had a Timeline that was out to specific activities --,36,,
397,0.97,2844.775,2845.142,As do I.,37,,
398,0.97,2845.142,2847.844,I have it by month you know.,38,,
399,0.97,2847.844,2849.913,And in April--2022 we will be here.,38,,
400,0.97,2849.913,2852.115,I will make sure to forward that to your officer.,38,,
401,0.97,2852.115,2853.584,Thank you so much.,39,,
402,0.97,2853.584,2855.052,I really appreciate it.,39,,
403,0.97,2855.052,2876.84,"Council member Herbold I appreciate your line of questioning and your support for continuing to identify all possible ways to have alternative first responders and I know that you are very interested in the piece and apologies for Misspeaking about the $700,000 and thank you for the clarification ally.",40,,
404,0.97,2876.84,2877.107,And Anne.,40,,
405,0.97,2877.107,2877.374,And Greg.,40,,
406,0.97,2877.374,2882.613,"So just to reiterate, you had asked how much is in the 2022 budget?",40,,
407,0.97,2882.613,2897.361,"I was assuming we were keeping 700 as it carried over but if we do account for the $700,000 from last year, we just reduced $948,000 from this year.",40,,
408,0.97,2897.361,2899.429,There's still $1.2 million in for this program.,40,,
409,0.97,2899.429,2901.798,"I was thinking we still had $700,000 plus.",40,,
410,0.97,2901.798,2908.438,But just a different pot of money there.,40,,
411,0.97,2908.438,2910.407,So retaining $1.2 million in this section.,40,,
412,0.97,2910.407,2911.141,Thank you very much.,40,,
413,0.97,2911.141,2912.876,To the next item now.,40,,
414,0.97,2912.876,2917.18,"Great, thank you for the discussion.",41,,
415,0.97,2917.18,2923.487,The next action reduces funding in the Seattle police department by $10.8 million.,41,,
416,0.97,2923.487,2925.922,Through a combination of actions.,41,,
417,0.97,2925.922,2933.397,The first a reduction of $1.1 million for hiring incentives.,41,,
418,0.97,2933.397,2936.566,The Secnd reduces technology projects by $1.24 million.,41,,
419,0.97,2936.566,2941.905,The 2022 proposed budget included $5 million in funding for seven different technology projects.,41,,
420,0.97,2941.905,2945.208,This action removes funding for two of those seven projects.,41,,
421,0.97,2945.208,2953.216,The active work force bonus management and the Eaq forum that evaluates service through body worn camera footage.,41,,
422,0.97,2953.216,2957.454,Retaining funding for the other five projects.,41,,
423,0.97,2957.454,2960.824,And Pausing maybe on each line that might be helpful.,42,,
424,0.97,2960.824,2968.632,Council member Herbold has the hand up and you might be saying the same thing I was going to note but I will turn it over to you Council member Herbold.,42,,
425,0.97,2968.632,2969.032,Please go ahead.,42,,
426,0.97,2969.032,2974.171,I think I know what you are going say Madame chair.,43,,
427,0.97,2974.171,2974.438,Mosqueda.,43,,
428,0.97,2974.438,2975.339,And maybe I'll follow you.,43,,
429,0.97,2975.339,2975.505,No.,43,,
430,0.97,2975.505,2980.544,I think you are going say--you are going to talk about what's preserved.,43,,
431,0.97,2980.544,2981.044,The Tokenology budget.,43,,
432,0.97,2981.044,2983.347,I have a question about what may not still be there.,43,,
433,0.97,2983.347,2987.651,I was actually going to comment on the health and Well- being of first responders.,44,,
434,0.97,2987.651,2996.426,And to note that we have maintained mental health counselors for first responders including Sfd and SPD.,44,,
435,0.97,2996.426,3001.131,The health and well-being of the first respond Sers something the Council has Prioritized and invested in in the past.,44,,
436,0.97,3001.131,3002.132,We continue to do that.,44,,
437,0.97,3002.132,3013.01,"Relating to the technology here, this is a good example of a technology that might be important and might be important to look for Federal dollars potentially to use to deploy here.",44,,
438,0.97,3013.01,3033.93,"But when we are looking at a budget deficit again of $15 million and the crisis that people continue to live in, investing in a new technology to monitor someone's heart rate, for example, felt like a potential nice to have in the future possibly with some additional analysis, but not a necessary to have in the moment of crisis when people are suffering.",44,,
439,0.97,3033.93,3039.169,And we need to make sure that every dollar is being deployed assisting the community.,44,,
440,0.97,3039.169,3040.27,That's where that decision is made.,44,,
441,0.97,3040.27,3050.213,I also wanted to tee up maybe the conversation or question that Council member Herbold had and Encouragal traffic also Chime in and add additional context here.,44,,
442,0.97,3050.213,3064.227,We did make sure to ask the police accountability monitor to make sure that the court monitor--to make sure that the items that we were considering reducing from technology were not of concern.,44,,
443,0.97,3064.227,3070.434,None of the items as far as I understand that we are Redicing in technology are any concern to the court monitor.,44,,
444,0.97,3070.434,3074.438,We had a conversation and tried to check in as always and identify any concerns early on.,44,,
445,0.97,3074.438,3086.316,"So just to reiterate and it's in the bottom of Esther's Email that we received about these potential issues and Esther, I don't have it in front of me.",44,,
446,0.97,3086.316,3090.454,Then I'll turn it other to Council member Herbold for a follow-up question.,44,,
447,0.97,3090.454,3103.967,I don't have that Email in front of me either but it essentially says that cut doesn't include any of the technology projects where the police monitor has expressed any concern.,45,,
448,0.97,3103.967,3104.868,Thank you.,45,,
449,0.97,3104.868,3105.502,Thank you.,46,,
450,0.97,3105.502,3108.138,Vice chair Herbold.,46,,
451,0.97,3108.138,3110.574,Thank you.,47,,
452,0.97,3110.574,3114.544,"Madame chair, appreciate understanding your thinking for making this cut.",47,,
453,0.97,3114.544,3121.852,"For the viewing public, this was not proposed--the technology investments were not proposed to be cut.",47,,
454,0.97,3121.852,3129.793,They were proposed to be Provisod and Council member Gonzalez provided it on the technology investments.,47,,
455,0.97,3129.793,3139.769,With an understanding that those funds would be released as we learned more about the--the plan for the investments in the intended outcomes.,47,,
456,0.97,3139.769,3162.159,"And we had also in this proviso I think had really useful way Prioritized release of money without sort of the--the you know, the hoops to jump through or the--or the reports to be delivered.",47,,
457,0.97,3162.159,3170.767,We had Prioritized some of the investments in order to get the dollars out the door for those investments.,47,,
458,0.97,3170.767,3175.739,And I appreciate this--is a different approach.,47,,
459,0.97,3175.739,3184.714,"Rather than Provisoing all the money, it is a--reduction of some of the money.",47,,
460,0.97,3184.714,3199.296,I am--and I appreciate that the reduction does not touch technology projects that the monitor has identified as priority consent decree technology projects.,47,,
461,0.97,3199.296,3217.08,I am a little bit concerned though about the--my understanding from central staff's issue Id paper and the Appendix that describes each of these investments.,47,,
462,0.97,3217.08,3233.663,"One of them is very, very closely tied as I understand it, under the Eaq forum, to the risk assessment work that is the follow-up to the Nick Jr.",47,,
463,0.97,3233.663,3234.264,Recommendations.,47,,
464,0.97,3234.264,3254.284,And specifically the creation of arm index for Seattle which will fund the basis of the risk based deployment model that is used in the other technology project that's being held harmless.,47,,
465,0.97,3254.284,3256.119,The risk management demand project.,47,,
466,0.97,3256.119,3271.134,"It's my understanding there's around $260,000 in the Eaq item that is again, that is a necessary component of the Reimagining policing to fewer police officers responding to 911 calls.",47,,
467,0.97,3271.134,3274.904,So just like to learn more about that.,47,,
468,0.97,3274.904,3277.941,And then also part of the Trulio --,47,,
469,0.97,3277.941,3281.144,Do you mind if I pause you on that one?,48,,
470,0.97,3281.144,3285.749,And have central staff maybe respond to that first one and then I'll come back.,48,,
471,0.97,3285.749,3287.284,It's much shorter with the second one.,49,,
472,0.97,3287.284,3293.857,The other one I thought was a joint project with Oig.,49,,
473,0.97,3293.857,3303.366,Where Oig was proposing to do an assessment of disparate treatment that people may receive in policing interactions.,49,,
474,0.97,3303.366,3316.046,And they were going to work with the police Department to do Aplite--I think amazing project of analyzing information captured by body worn Video.,49,,
475,0.97,3316.046,3330.026,And just wanting to understand a little bit more about that one too.,49,,
476,0.97,3330.026,3348.211,"So you are correct that the--equity, accountability and quality Eaq project that was originally proposed for a million dollars had sort of two parts to it.",50,,
477,0.97,3348.211,3359.923,"One part was a--$260,000 component that would evaluate the Nick Jr. study and that was being done by the research Triangle Institute.",50,,
478,0.97,3359.923,3366.73,The chair's budget breaks that part out and funds it separately.,50,,
479,0.97,3366.73,3391.554,The other part was the--component that the Oig was going to work with the Department on for the--the new--the Leveraging of the body worn Video to create a measure of service equity basically measuring the quality of police interactions to determine disparities.,50,,
480,0.97,3391.554,3398.461,"That component was $740,000 and is not funded in the chair's budget.",50,,
481,0.97,3398.461,3398.762,Okay.,51,,
482,0.97,3398.762,3399.062,Thank you.,51,,
483,0.97,3399.062,3400.363,Appreciate it.,51,,
484,0.97,3400.363,3401.03,Thank you.,52,,
485,0.97,3401.03,3406.369,Thank you for clarifying also where the first item was included in the budget.,52,,
486,0.97,3406.369,3407.337,And just broken out.,52,,
487,0.97,3407.337,3410.707,Again I'll probably say this two times.,52,,
488,0.97,3410.707,3437.6,There's a number data that's PR is important.,52,,
489,0.97,3437.6,3440.27,Ry directing funding to gun violence prevention.,52,,
490,0.97,3440.27,3442.438,Thank you Council member Herbold for your help on that.,52,,
491,0.97,3442.438,3472.669,"Assistance and I want to thank Council members Lewis and Strauss and Herbold for continuing to emphasize mental health interventions so really I think it's a matter of how do we do both and in a budget like this, we did make a decision to reduce that $740,000 which might be an important investment again if there's additional Federal dollars that I'm hearing could potentially be available Maybe that's another opportunity to fund.",52,,
492,0.97,3472.669,3472.936,Okay.,53,,
493,0.97,3472.936,3475.405,Let's continue.,53,,
494,0.97,3475.405,3475.672,Great.,54,,
495,0.97,3475.672,3485.582,The next item on this list is a reduction in the expansion of the community service officer program at the Seattle police Department.,54,,
496,0.97,3485.582,3490.653,The 2022 proposed budget assumed six new Ftes.,54,,
497,0.97,3490.653,3497.26,And six new vehicles for a new squad of six community safety officers.,54,,
498,0.97,3497.26,3514.611,This proposal would pause the expansion of the CSA program to allow time to determine how the program might be aligned with new alternative 911 response services that are being added in the 2022 proposed budget.,54,,
499,0.97,3514.611,3519.949,"Great, did you have anything else you wanted to add to that one?",55,,
500,0.97,3519.949,3523.453,No.,56,,
501,0.97,3523.453,3523.72,Okay.,57,,
502,0.97,3523.72,3524.087,Let's continue.,57,,
503,0.97,3524.087,3524.354,Great.,58,,
504,0.97,3524.354,3528.858,Next is $2.7 million reduction assuming additional staffing plans separations that --,58,,
505,0.97,3528.858,3532.929,"I'm so sorry, I want to just mention something very briefly.",59,,
506,0.97,3532.929,3537.734,So--I want to thank the Csos and I want to thank members of teamsters 17.,59,,
507,0.97,3537.734,3543.94,They have continued to engage with the council as we've been talking about how we can scale up more of the CSO programs.,59,,
508,0.97,3543.94,3551.614,As with you know we just I think in September allocated funding for an additional unit of Coss.,59,,
509,0.97,3551.614,3554.017,The work of the Csos is not in question.,59,,
510,0.97,3554.017,3570.233,Ongoing question is the placement and location of the Csos in the future and in conversations with members who are Csos wanted to reiterate our support for them and also this is not a cut to the program.,59,,
511,0.97,3570.233,3584.881,This is just holding off on the expansion until the question of where they are housed for future units to be expanded upon is decided and Ideally all the Csos will be kept together and be in one location in the future.,59,,
512,0.97,3584.881,3588.484,That really recognizes the community service side of the Csos.,59,,
513,0.97,3588.484,3593.556,But want to make sure to reiterate we have not cut any of the existing Csos.,59,,
514,0.97,3593.556,3603.967,This was a proposed expansion and we just added an expansion earlier this year.,59,,
515,0.97,3603.967,3604.167,Okay.,59,,
516,0.97,3604.167,3607.103,Let's continue.,59,,
517,0.97,3607.103,3607.437,Thank you.,60,,
518,0.97,3607.437,3619.482,Next to the--$2.7 million reduction in additional assuming additional staffing plan separations that more closely reflects the current attrition rate from the Department.,60,,
519,0.97,3619.482,3626.856,The balancing package fully funds the hiring plan proposed for 2022 including 125 recruits and Lateral hires.,60,,
520,0.97,3626.856,3627.09,Great.,60,,
521,0.97,3627.09,3632.762,"Anything more you want to add to that, Greg?",60,,
522,0.97,3632.762,3633.029,Yeah.,61,,
523,0.97,3633.029,3651.214,"Just to Reemphasize that--or to emphasize that the hiring plan of 125 new officers is fully funded and the separations that are assumed, there's--two parts to that.",61,,
524,0.97,3651.214,3663.926,The first part is that the separations in 2022 will basically mirror the separations that the Council assumed in 2021.,61,,
525,0.97,3663.926,3669.632,"In 2021, the Council had thought there would be 114 separations.",61,,
526,0.97,3669.632,3677.24,Turns out there were well over--there's going to be well over 150.,61,,
527,0.97,3677.24,3681.244,But the Council had assumed 114.,61,,
528,0.97,3681.244,3688.251,And the Council will again assume 114 in 2022.,61,,
529,0.97,3688.251,3695.291,There are also 12 additional separations that are assumed as a result of the Covid vaccine mandate.,61,,
530,0.97,3695.291,3713.576,"At this point in time, or I should say as of five days ago, as of November 5th there were 80 officers that were Unvaccinated and Undeployable out on leave that were having a combination request reviewed by the city.",61,,
531,0.97,3713.576,3723.886,Those accommodation requests the Council expects are going take a while and the Council expects 12 of those will result in separation at some point in time in January.,61,,
532,0.97,3723.886,3730.026,They will add to the separation forecast that I just spoke about that will mirror last year.,61,,
533,0.97,3730.026,3736.599,And the two coming together will result in 125 separations.,61,,
534,0.97,3736.599,3746.742,The same number of hires you will have a staffing forecast that's 125 hires and 125 separations.,61,,
535,0.97,3746.742,3757.52,It will net zero and that is--going to result in the ability for the budget to be cut by $2.7 million.,61,,
536,0.97,3757.52,3768.097,For police salaries that will not need to be used because the additional separations are expected to happen.,61,,
537,0.97,3768.097,3776.005,Any questions here?,62,,
538,0.97,3776.005,3776.439,Vice chair Herbold.,62,,
539,0.97,3776.439,3781.277,I'll add you in there--Juarez.,62,,
540,0.97,3781.277,3784.447,Council member Lewis and then Council member Pearson.,62,,
541,0.97,3784.447,3792.188,I have a question about hour ability with this--reduction.,63,,
542,0.97,3792.188,3794.357,In assumed separations.,63,,
543,0.97,3794.357,3809.939,I just trying to figure out how this proposal impacts our ability to continue to say that the staffing--SPD staffing budget is fully funded.,63,,
544,0.97,3809.939,3823.085,"My understanding is that the 2022 proposal recognizes that 1,223 can be hired under--well, that's the total with what can be hired under the staffing plan.",63,,
545,0.97,3823.085,3825.822,And this reduces the total to 1200.,63,,
546,0.97,3825.822,3844.64,"Is that--is that more or less correct and I'm just wondering the Assumptionings that are underlying the increased separations assumptions, my notes show that this September update sent to Council has numbers through August.",63,,
547,0.97,3844.64,3859.088,And shows that there were 68 separations over the first four months and 49 separations in the next four months.,63,,
548,0.97,3859.088,3874.17,"And the--the chief has--my regular meetings with him, Referenced his review of the hiring reports to suggest that separations are actually slowing.",63,,
549,0.97,3874.17,3879.141,So just wondering if central staff can comment on that.,63,,
550,0.97,3879.141,3880.943,Okay.,64,,
551,0.97,3880.943,3881.878,Start with the first one.,64,,
552,0.97,3881.878,3896.025,The--it's important to make a distinction between the staffing plan being fully funded as it was submitted in the proposed budget and the SPD hiring plan being fully funded.,64,,
553,0.97,3896.025,3906.669,The chair's budget fully funds the hiring plan in the sense that there is funding in the budget to hire 125 officers.,64,,
554,0.97,3906.669,3917.68,The--there is funding removed the $2.7 million because the chair's budget assumes that more officers are going to leave the Department.,64,,
555,0.97,3917.68,3926.255,"So it's not--it's not correct to say that the staffing plan as it was submitted by the Mayor, is fully funded.",64,,
556,0.97,3926.255,3931.694,"Because as you point out Council member, the number of FTE that was funded.",64,,
557,0.97,3931.694,3934.997,It would have assumed that only 94 separations would happen.,64,,
558,0.97,3934.997,3943.005,And the Council is assuming that there will be 125 and taking the difference in dollars to $2.7 million.,64,,
559,0.97,3943.005,3951.681,So that is the case to say that the hiring plan is--is fully funded.,64,,
560,0.97,3951.681,3966.028,"In terms of separations, it is the Department's staffing plan through September that projects that there will be 150 separations through the end of the year.",64,,
561,0.97,3966.028,3974.904,"And that includes Actuals through September 30th with projections for October, November and December.",64,,
562,0.97,3974.904,3977.84,And it's their own projections that I am citing.,64,,
563,0.97,3977.84,3992.021,"So if the chief is saying that he thinks that something different might happen in the next three months, then that would be something that would be good for him to send to the Council.",64,,
564,0.97,3992.021,3993.989,Revised hiring plan would be good.,64,,
565,0.97,3993.989,4014.343,"But at this point in time, certainly the--the number of separations that have occurred are at least consistent with what the Council is assuming at the 114 level or for sure will be consistent with what the Council is assuming at the 114 level.",64,,
566,0.97,4014.343,4018.547,And I think you have one other question that I may be forgetting.,64,,
567,0.97,4018.547,4021.083,I think you covered everything.,65,,
568,0.97,4021.083,4029.258,"I just--what I was saying about the actual separations, and you know, I know you can cut this information lots of different ways.",65,,
569,0.97,4029.258,4056.819,"But if you look at the first four months compared to the last four months, of the--for the--the most recent 2021 report covering the first eight months of 2021, if you compare the first four months to the last four months, there's--the second four months is a significantly I guess--I don't know.",65,,
570,0.97,4056.819,4057.82,Smaller number than the first four months.,65,,
571,0.97,4057.82,4061.957,Which I don't know if that makes a trend.,65,,
572,0.97,4061.957,4065.728,Certainly hope so.,66,,
573,0.97,4065.728,4066.929,Thank you very much.,67,,
574,0.97,4066.929,4077.573,So I want to make sure to lift up a few of the pieces that Greg noted in his initial comments and then respond to you.,67,,
575,0.97,4077.573,4096.859,"The Mayor's office assumed only 94 separations when we are seeing this year according to SPD's own data and use of actual separations until September and SPD's own prognosis of the expected separations for October, November and December.",67,,
576,0.97,4096.859,4101.664,We anticipate based on SPD's data there will be 150 separations this year.,67,,
577,0.97,4101.664,4105.167,We are not assuming 150 separations next year.,67,,
578,0.97,4105.167,4111.24,We are only assuming 114 separations just like we assumed last year.,67,,
579,0.97,4111.24,4123.486,"Additionally, as Greg noted, with the vaccination mandate, we know that there's 80 officers who have requested special accommodations for not receiving their vaccination.",67,,
580,0.97,4123.486,4134.13,While we know the Department is working to address the accommodation there are many folks on the in t front line who do require interaction with the public.,67,,
581,0.97,4134.13,4148.177,"Conservatively, I think it's a fair estimate to assume that the dozens of those 80 will not be able to have an accommodation and that is where the total universe of 126 officers separating next year comes from.",67,,
582,0.97,4148.177,4157.086,Just wanted to make sure to underscore the points for members of the viewing public not necessarily for my colleagues because I know you are steeped in this information.,67,,
583,0.97,4157.086,4164.059,But this is a very important NOTE for why we were able to accomplish that resource.,67,,
584,0.97,4164.059,4171.4,"Not because we're cutting existing dollars for future hires, we are still allowing for those future hires as the Mayor's hiring plan projected.",67,,
585,0.97,4171.4,4176.739,I think we're making some informed decisions about where dollars may be sitting on the table.,67,,
586,0.97,4176.739,4182.411,And if more officers leave then the 94 projected by the Mayor and next year's budget.,67,,
587,0.97,4182.411,4187.583,"Council member Juarez, please go ahead.",67,,
588,0.97,4187.583,4189.518,"Council member Juarez, you are on mute.",67,,
589,0.97,4189.518,4191.954,I know you are saying --,67,,
590,0.97,4191.954,4192.621,Know that by now.,68,,
591,0.97,4192.621,4192.855,Thanks.,68,,
592,0.97,4192.855,4201.096,"I think you answered a lot of what my question was going to be, the back and forth on the separations and the assumptions.",68,,
593,0.97,4201.096,4211.207,So just so I can--there's one kind of technical question I have and you can get that to me or maybe the viewing public wants to know as well.,68,,
594,0.97,4211.207,4218.18,"The five cuts to SPD I noticed that--item number one and five state who the sponsor is but two, three and four don't.",68,,
595,0.97,4218.18,4224.887,"So I'd like to know who the sponsors were originally for the technology, the expansion and the additional staffing.",68,,
596,0.97,4224.887,4230.492,I don't know if there's a reason why you put a particular Council member like --,68,,
597,0.97,4230.492,4231.66,I can answer that.,69,,
598,0.97,4231.66,4240.135,So for some of these proposals they were initially proposed as Council member Herbold noted as Provisos.,69,,
599,0.97,4240.135,4243.472,They were suggested before the known $15 million deficit.,69,,
600,0.97,4243.472,4248.21,We did not associate a council member name with these items because they are changed.,69,,
601,0.97,4248.21,4249.144,Tey are not a proviso.,69,,
602,0.97,4249.144,4261.624,They are a reduction and so I as the chair and the sponsor of the three because they are different from what was originally proposed by the Council members who may have suggested a proviso.,69,,
603,0.97,4261.624,4279.675,It's also a reflection of the concept though that was discussed publicly more in line of--more in the vein of a proviso but we adhered to the transparency here if it was not associated with the council member's initial request.,69,,
604,0.97,4279.675,4283.646,When I changed it I have the chair's name next to it.,69,,
605,0.97,4283.646,4289.351,"Second, so I just want to make sure and maybe it's just me.",70,,
606,0.97,4289.351,4294.223,So we are assuming 125 hires and 125 separations.,70,,
607,0.97,4294.223,4298.093,And the 125 separations is a--equals $2.7 million in savings.,70,,
608,0.97,4298.093,4301.463,As for the $2.7 million came from.,70,,
609,0.97,4301.463,4307.036,Is that a correct summation?,70,,
610,0.97,4307.036,4307.269,Yes.,71,,
611,0.97,4307.269,4307.569,Okay.,72,,
612,0.97,4307.569,4308.404,So okay.,72,,
613,0.97,4308.404,4317.579,So I know Council member Herbold shared some additional information.,72,,
614,0.97,4317.579,4319.214,So do we anticipate and I--Council member Herbold thank you.,72,,
615,0.97,4319.214,4323.952,Because I know you meet with the chief regularly.,72,,
616,0.97,4323.952,4328.424,Be updated if the assumptions change?,72,,
617,0.97,4328.424,4328.824,Yes.,73,,
618,0.97,4328.824,4334.029,The--the slide that Council her Herbold sponsored.,73,,
619,0.97,4334.029,4344.373,"Spd 001 requires the Department to send to the Council quarterly, a staffing report and the reality is that they send it to me monthly.",73,,
620,0.97,4344.373,4349.211,And I confer with the public safety chair pretty much monthly.,73,,
621,0.97,4349.211,4350.579,On the staffing report.,73,,
622,0.97,4350.579,4356.118,"And so in--in mostly Realtime, we keep up with the Department's staffing.",73,,
623,0.97,4356.118,4363.792,"So yes, we will be monitoring that and we will see changes in the trend.",73,,
624,0.97,4363.792,4364.059,Greg.,74,,
625,0.97,4364.059,4373.502,Is a it going to be fair to say we have been pretty much close to Assuages we have made in staffing for 2021 and 2022?,74,,
626,0.97,4373.502,4373.869,Not really.,75,,
627,0.97,4373.869,4374.036,No.,75,,
628,0.97,4374.036,4375.003,We've been --,75,,
629,0.97,4375.003,4375.27,Okay.,76,,
630,0.97,4375.27,4375.671,[Laughter],76,,
631,0.97,4375.671,4376.872,"Unfortunately, we have been --",77,,
632,0.97,4376.872,4377.239,I know.,78,,
633,0.97,4377.239,4377.539,Thank you.,78,,
634,0.97,4377.539,4383.078,I'm just trying to get--I'm trying to take notes and trying--go ahead.,78,,
635,0.97,4383.078,4386.982,I'll let you answer.,78,,
636,0.97,4386.982,4387.549,I apologize.,78,,
637,0.97,4387.549,4388.15,Unfortunately no.,79,,
638,0.97,4388.15,4390.819,Neither the Department or the Council has been even close.,79,,
639,0.97,4390.819,4396.492,There has been--there have been significantly more separations than either side have predicted.,79,,
640,0.97,4396.492,4399.461,But that's an important question Council member Juarez.,80,,
641,0.97,4399.461,4413.709,"I think that if the concerns was that were assuming more cost savings, than the numbers are actually bearing out, then that would be absolutely a problem from a budgetary perspective as well.",80,,
642,0.97,4413.709,4421.417,But what we're seeing as Greg just noted is higher than anticipated separations so if anything there's additional salary savings.,80,,
643,0.97,4421.417,4428.19,A lot of conversation we just had to have last month about the higher than anticipated salary savings.,80,,
644,0.97,4428.19,4440.235,We are conservative in our estimate here of how much salary savings we are Camturing for investments in the budget.,80,,
645,0.97,4440.235,4442.571,Thank you Council member Mosqueda.,81,,
646,0.97,4442.571,4447.042,I'm glad you walked through the $10.8 million cuts.,81,,
647,0.97,4447.042,4447.509,Within SPD the five.,81,,
648,0.97,4447.509,4454.583,Now I have a better understanding and I know we're not--we got one more to go.,81,,
649,0.97,4454.583,4456.084,On the salary savings.,81,,
650,0.97,4456.084,4465.461,I'm not inclined to support cutting the hiring incentive but the other four make sense to know.,81,,
651,0.97,4465.461,4475.037,There's more to share but I'm going to put that out there now in light of the assumptions we're making I want to again be transparent and candid with everybody.,81,,
652,0.97,4475.037,4475.637,Just leave it at that.,81,,
653,0.97,4475.637,4476.839,Thank you Madame chair.,81,,
654,0.97,4476.839,4482.177,Thank you for the early Heads-Up Council member Juarez.,82,,
655,0.97,4482.177,4485.38,Appreciate your note of support for four of the five.,82,,
656,0.97,4485.38,4485.681,Thank you.,82,,
657,0.97,4485.681,4487.916,Council member Lewis and then Council member Pedersen.,82,,
658,0.97,4487.916,4493.121,Thank you Madame chair and I think this is going back to Greg just for a second.,83,,
659,0.97,4493.121,4501.997,And it's similar area that Council member Juarez and Council member Herbold went over on our assumptions on separations.,83,,
660,0.97,4501.997,4504.733,And I want to make sure I have the formula right.,83,,
661,0.97,4504.733,4512.04,In how we get to the--the net zero 125 assumption.,83,,
662,0.97,4512.04,4527.789,So Monalsing is that we're repeating our 114 level that we set in the previous budget and then the balance is made up from assumptions from the Mayor's vaccine--or the city's vaccine mandate.,83,,
663,0.97,4527.789,4529.258,Is that correct?,83,,
664,0.97,4529.258,4530.559,Pretty much.,84,,
665,0.97,4530.559,4539.067,"I mean, it's--it's 113 and then 12 is the--precise math.",84,,
666,0.97,4539.067,4539.334,Yeah.,85,,
667,0.97,4539.334,4547.175,"Is there--you know, I mean, I don't want to Retread this because I think Council member Juarez basically just did there.",85,,
668,0.97,4547.175,4559.454,"But you know, I would like to have a better idea about how we are setting the formula to come up with the predicted separations.",85,,
669,0.97,4559.454,4564.159,"You know, it's still not sitting completely well with me from the last budget.",85,,
670,0.97,4564.159,4577.573,When we--we set the anticipated separations at the anticipated hire number still feels to me like it was a little--convenient to do that.,85,,
671,0.97,4577.573,4587.416,And I would just rather have the formula be based in--in something other than trying to match the number of hires.,85,,
672,0.97,4587.416,4592.554,"And I'm not convinced that this formula is doing that unless you can convince me otherwise, Greg.",85,,
673,0.97,4592.554,4595.123,Like and I'm not saying it should be lower necessarily.,85,,
674,0.97,4595.123,4596.992,I'm not--I don't think it should be higher.,85,,
675,0.97,4596.992,4608.804,I just like the formula to be based in something that seems to be a more defensible number than the number of hires which is what it appears to me to be based on here.,85,,
676,0.97,4608.804,4614.042,And I know that's not completely fair.,85,,
677,0.97,4614.042,4616.411,"But I mean, optically it looks like Thatment tell me why it isn't.",85,,
678,0.97,4616.411,4623.986,What I think I would tell you is this.,86,,
679,0.97,4623.986,4629.992,The department has indicated and I hope you will allow me to speak for just a moment.,86,,
680,0.97,4629.992,4637.799,The department has indicated that there's no statistical way at this point they can predict using the past what the future might look like.,86,,
681,0.97,4637.799,4641.269,The swings have been too great lately.,86,,
682,0.97,4641.269,4656.418,"So being able to look at the history and come up with any kind of way to look forward and say what is reasonable from a statistical standpoint, really is difficult at this point.",86,,
683,0.97,4656.418,4664.726,"In fact, about six months ago, the Department refused to do it any longer.",86,,
684,0.97,4664.726,4665.093,Projections.,86,,
685,0.97,4665.093,4667.095,They put forward projections for the budget because they had to.,86,,
686,0.97,4667.095,4671.933,They had to--they had to fund something.,86,,
687,0.97,4671.933,4675.437,And so they put forward projections.,86,,
688,0.97,4675.437,4681.009,The Council is putting forward projections because they have to fund something.,86,,
689,0.97,4681.009,4692.254,There are other ways that you could Bookend the staffing plan if you were not comfortable with 125 and 125.,86,,
690,0.97,4692.254,4707.969,There are--there are--there is a salary savings proviso that restricts SPD from spending any of its salary savings on anything other than salaries for officers.,86,,
691,0.97,4707.969,4721.75,So the Council could choose to cut less of the salary savings instead of cutting the $2.7 million they could cut--you all could cut a smaller amount of salary savings.,86,,
692,0.97,4721.75,4738.266,And you could keep some amount in the budget just in case the projections are off in that particular direction.,86,,
693,0.97,4738.266,4747.075,And the case is that there are--there's a need to capture more salary savings.,86,,
694,0.97,4747.075,4760.922,"Or you could--if there's a need to capture more salary savings, you have got the salary savings proviso there.",86,,
695,0.97,4760.922,4774.136,I think that that--that probably--you could reduce the amount and capture it through that proviso.,86,,
696,0.97,4774.136,4787.048,"If you increased the amount, you would probably be facing the potential of having to--if the--if the projections were wrong, come back later and provide more money.",86,,
697,0.97,4787.048,4792.954,So I think those are your two options.,86,,
698,0.97,4792.954,4798.16,And I'll ask ally to jump in and see if I have said anything wrong here.,86,,
699,0.97,4798.16,4798.86,"Thank you, Greg.",87,,
700,0.97,4798.86,4807.169,"I think that you covered it and I would just NOTE you know, the budget itself is based on a set of assumptions and projections.",87,,
701,0.97,4807.169,4809.037,Revenue forecast and all of that.,87,,
702,0.97,4809.037,4831.193,"As well all experienced over the last several years sometimes the assumptions with new information get updated and Council then has to take up the issue and I think that's the sort of the case here, last year, Similarly, the Council adopted a budget that modified the assumptions of the--executive had made and their proposed budget.",87,,
703,0.97,4831.193,4841.269,"And made some modifications and it turned out that in addition to those salary savings, there was another $15 million this year because Greg noted it's hard to really you know, see trends right now.",87,,
704,0.97,4841.269,4845.373,Given what's been going on over the last few years.,87,,
705,0.97,4845.373,4845.707,In the world.,87,,
706,0.97,4845.707,4856.918,But I think that this is a similar exercise that the committee took up last year in sort of thinking through the assumptions that the proposed budget was based on and making some modifications.,87,,
707,0.97,4856.918,4859.754,Based on the information in hand today.,87,,
708,0.97,4859.754,4860.889,Thank you ally.,88,,
709,0.97,4860.889,4868.83,I would start I think--I'm sorry I got stuck there caught in thought.,88,,
710,0.97,4868.83,4869.164,For a moment.,88,,
711,0.97,4869.164,4873.568,I was trying to think about the two approaches.,88,,
712,0.97,4873.568,4893.521,"The council could choose to cut less than $2.7 million and rely on the salary savings proviso if indeed there are more people that leave, or the exact 125 leave, then the Council will have the salary savings proviso and they could go back in and cut the amount later.",88,,
713,0.97,4893.521,4901.096,"But if the Council chose to cut more than $2.7 million, then that would be the case where they would have to go add money later.",88,,
714,0.97,4901.096,4913.475,"So those are basically the two approaches I think that the Council would have if they chose any other assumptions, then what the chair is choosing now.",88,,
715,0.97,4913.475,4914.042,"Okay, thank you Greg.",89,,
716,0.97,4914.042,4914.943,Thank you very much.,90,,
717,0.97,4914.943,4917.512,Thank you very much Greg and thank you very much ally.,90,,
718,0.97,4917.512,4929.257,"Again, as a reminder for folks, the challenge that we have was to identify any funding that was being put to the side in anticipation of some future use.",90,,
719,0.97,4929.257,4941.202,"If it seemed like that money was not going to be spent in 2022, that meant that there was additional resources for us to be able to deploy to immediate assistance in this moment.",90,,
720,0.97,4941.202,4946.074,"I absolutely thank central staff for the good work, the detailed work that grounded work that they've done.",90,,
721,0.97,4946.074,4951.713,To make the analysis on what additional separations we could anticipate this year.,90,,
722,0.97,4951.713,4960.388,"Using 114 as our base from last year, which is still under the expected separation of 150 separations for 2021.",90,,
723,0.97,4960.388,4960.922,Is very sound.,90,,
724,0.97,4960.922,4973.969,"In the moment that we were looking at the separations possibilities from the vaccination mandate, there was about initially three dozen folks who had--I believe had noted that they wanted some additional accommodation.",90,,
725,0.97,4973.969,4978.039,That number has gone up to 80 people who are seeking accommodation.,90,,
726,0.97,4978.039,4986.181,Assuming a dozens of those are not going to be able to achieve their desired accommodations seems very conservative.,90,,
727,0.97,4986.181,4986.548,And reasonable.,90,,
728,0.97,4986.548,5000.128,So the last thing that I want us to be in a position of is having to have reduced SPD's budget by more than the actual reductions.,90,,
729,0.97,5000.128,5002.23,"Excuse me, by--assuming a higher attrition rate than the actual rate.",90,,
730,0.97,5002.23,5007.869,I don't want it to be in a position to then have to stall or delay in getting money back to SPD.,90,,
731,0.97,5007.869,5017.011,And having to vote later seemed like a--unnecessary situation if we need a conservative estimate here.,90,,
732,0.97,5017.011,5019.214,This is a conservative estimate.,90,,
733,0.97,5019.214,5019.714,Of attrition in 2022.,90,,
734,0.97,5019.714,5025.854,And I appreciate the ongoing conversation that we will believe having here soon about how we can support Retension.,90,,
735,0.97,5025.854,5031.693,But that's I think a very sound estimate that central staff has offered us.,90,,
736,0.97,5031.693,5037.198,I'm going to Cogo Council member Pedersen and Council member Herbold.,90,,
737,0.97,5037.198,5046.875,Thank you Council member Mosqueda and thank you for putting together the balancing package and hard work of central staff over the past few weeks here.,91,,
738,0.97,5046.875,5064.259,Just want to really acknowledge the hard work that went into the budget review to get to this point and obviously this is one of the more--controversial things to be discussing so I realize that--it's worth the robust discussion here because of the importance of it.,91,,
739,0.97,5064.259,5066.494,I apt concerned about the proposed cuts.,91,,
740,0.97,5066.494,5071.633,The first time I saw them was yesterday with most others.,91,,
741,0.97,5071.633,5075.036,And I'm concerned about 911 response times.,91,,
742,0.97,5075.036,5093.421,"And the need to staff large events and provide what's the resources needed to retain officers and also as we look to finalizing the next permanent chief of police, and I really appreciate the additional context and explanations today.",91,,
743,0.97,5093.421,5101.663,I do feel like there's still some uncertainty and I appreciate what the assumptions are based on.,91,,
744,0.97,5101.663,5109.737,"At the same time I'm hearing that while the hiring plan would be funded, the staffing plan would not be full funded.",91,,
745,0.97,5109.737,5138.333,"And I'm--I do like the idea of instead of cutting and Redeploying rather, perhaps, what was mentioned by central staff, the idea of a proviso that would set aside funding and then we can see what actually does happen rather than just--making a hard cut now based on assumptions where things seem to be very fluid right now.",91,,
746,0.97,5138.333,5143.104,So--I'll probably reach out to central staff and explore more of this idea.,91,,
747,0.97,5143.104,5148.71,But proviso to help set aside some of these funds instead of scuttling them right now.,91,,
748,0.97,5148.71,5149.01,Thank you.,91,,
749,0.97,5149.01,5157.719,"And Council member, if I could jump in and tell you that the chair's package does include a proviso on salary savings.",92,,
750,0.97,5157.719,5160.822,So--it's something you wouldn't even need to do.,92,,
751,0.97,5160.822,5176.804,"You could just run an amendment to reduce the cut from $2.7 million and if there are salary savings, they would automatically be locked up by the proviso in the chair's package.",92,,
752,0.97,5176.804,5186.214,And--and that Wouldnd be something--that would be something that Council could access later and Reappropriate or remove the proviso.,92,,
753,0.97,5186.214,5191.352,"I would just--if I could, just add in though, just so we're all on the same page.",93,,
754,0.97,5191.352,5198.092,"If there's a proposal to remove any of these cuts, this is all necessary to support a balanced package.",93,,
755,0.97,5198.092,5207.569,So there will need to be an alternative offsetting cut proposed for a proposal to remove some of the new spending in this package.,93,,
756,0.97,5207.569,5209.437,To offset the reduction.,93,,
757,0.97,5209.437,5219.213,Because pulling any one of these cuts out and imposing proviso puts budget out of balance.,93,,
758,0.97,5219.213,5225.053,Hoping we continue to stay in balance.,93,,
759,0.97,5225.053,5225.353,Thank you.,93,,
760,0.97,5225.353,5226.688,Understood.,94,,
761,0.97,5226.688,5230.258,Chair Mosqueda a follow-up question?,94,,
762,0.97,5230.258,5242.47,"In terms of overtime needs, does the--do these cuts of staff take into account the--what might need to be spent on overtime?",94,,
763,0.97,5242.47,5247.008,Want to make clear there's not a cut in staff.,95,,
764,0.97,5247.008,5254.082,All of the expected hires for SPD as requested by the Mayor's office are assumed.,95,,
765,0.97,5254.082,5257.852,We are taking into account a more accurate picture of what separations would be.,95,,
766,0.97,5257.852,5264.892,So just want to make sure before central staff answers that I clarify.,95,,
767,0.97,5264.892,5267.328,There's not a cut in staff.,95,,
768,0.97,5267.328,5267.662,Thank you.,95,,
769,0.97,5267.662,5268.029,Thank you.,96,,
770,0.97,5268.029,5270.098,Thanks the chair is correct.,97,,
771,0.97,5270.098,5270.632,No cuts in staff.,97,,
772,0.97,5270.632,5273.534,The assumption is that these officers are going to leave.,97,,
773,0.97,5273.534,5281.676,And the cuts are simply taking the salaries that are not going to go to them.,97,,
774,0.97,5281.676,5286.714,There are cuts that are made to the overtime budget in the next item.,97,,
775,0.97,5286.714,5291.986,I guess I would ask whether or not the chair would want me to answer any other questions about this item.,97,,
776,0.97,5291.986,5295.857,And then move on to that before I hit overtime.,97,,
777,0.97,5295.857,5296.257,Let's pause.,98,,
778,0.97,5296.257,5298.226,And we'll take the last two hands.,98,,
779,0.97,5298.226,5316.944,And we do need to move on here to some of the other pieces so that we can get into what is added for the conversation around staffing and investments want to make sure we get there too but Council member Pedersen we will come back to your question about overtime.,98,,
780,0.97,5316.944,5319.681,Council member Herbold and Lewis for final comments.,98,,
781,0.97,5319.681,5325.186,I want to underscore very quickly what's already been said.,99,,
782,0.97,5325.186,5331.859,In I believe it was--early August?,99,,
783,0.97,5331.859,5337.198,We passed the mid year supplemental.,99,,
784,0.97,5337.198,5346.874,And part of the legislation included adjustments to SPD funding.,99,,
785,0.97,5346.874,5353.214,Úsome of those adjustments included finding ways for SPD to spend money.,99,,
786,0.97,5353.214,5358.219,$15Million in money that they could not spend in salaries.,99,,
787,0.97,5358.219,5379.307,"And we used these exact same as I'm understanding central staff and the chair explained, we're using these exact same separation assumptions and we were still $15 million to the good of SPD conservative.",99,,
788,0.97,5379.307,5387.148,So I just--I think this is a--an approach.,99,,
789,0.97,5387.148,5420.381,"What I'm--if what I'm explaining my understanding to be is correct, and you know, again, there was--$15 million in SPD's budget in August for salary, Savings and they could not spend, to implement, you know, what was basically the Council's endorsed hiring plan for SPD.",99,,
790,0.97,5420.381,5421.516,They couldn't spend those dollars.,99,,
791,0.97,5421.516,5425.486,That's all correct Council member.,100,,
792,0.97,5425.486,5427.588,Thank you vice chair.,101,,
793,0.97,5427.588,5429.223,And chair of public safety.,101,,
794,0.97,5429.223,5431.426,"Council member Lewis, did you have another comment?",101,,
795,0.97,5431.426,5434.896,I think I can take it Offline with central staff.,102,,
796,0.97,5434.896,5435.329,Appreciate it.,103,,
797,0.97,5435.329,5435.863,Council member Lewis.,103,,
798,0.97,5435.863,5436.497,Colleagues thank you so much.,103,,
799,0.97,5436.497,5445.439,I do believe we have one more item to cover in this section here.,103,,
800,0.97,5445.439,5448.276,"Is that correct, Greg?",103,,
801,0.97,5448.276,5448.509,Yes.,104,,
802,0.97,5448.509,5451.212,"Director, shall I just--take it --",104,,
803,0.97,5451.212,5453.681,You want to just walk through it.,105,,
804,0.97,5453.681,5456.05,Go for it.,105,,
805,0.97,5456.05,5458.986,The last cut of $4.5 million is--has several components to it.,106,,
806,0.97,5458.986,5461.856,And so I'm just going to go over the components.,106,,
807,0.97,5461.856,5469.13,It's the same cut that you heard about during the first round of Cbas.,106,,
808,0.97,5469.13,5471.032,As originally proposed by Council member Herbold.,106,,
809,0.97,5471.032,5475.203,The first component of this cut is a salary savings cut.,106,,
810,0.97,5475.203,5490.484,"Just in the time that the Mayor wrote her proposed budget from the time that she wrote it to the time it was transmitted, more officers left than were accounted for in the staffing plan.",106,,
811,0.97,5490.484,5496.824,"And so right away, there was $1.1 million in salary savings available to the Council.",106,,
812,0.97,5496.824,5504.632,"So the first thing that this cut did was to cut $850,000 of that salary savings.",106,,
813,0.97,5504.632,5529.59,"It did leave some of the salary savings in SPD for a relational policing program which is sort of a Pre-Training, Pre-Academy program for police recruits to--learn a little bit about community and get--community lens before they go to the Academy.",106,,
814,0.97,5529.59,5537.164,"Right away there's a--$850,000 salary savings cut for a different in projections.",106,,
815,0.97,5537.164,5540.968,And then there are some efficiency cuts.,106,,
816,0.97,5540.968,5544.805,The first of which is a $3.2 million overtime cut.,106,,
817,0.97,5544.805,5558.853,"And in that particular case, it is the reduction of the SPD overtime budget from a proposed level of $29.6 million.",106,,
818,0.97,5558.853,5563.557,Let me get the exact numbers here.,106,,
819,0.97,5563.557,5565.593,One second.,106,,
820,0.97,5565.593,5574.735,"Greg, I have that as the reduced overtime from $29.6 million to $26.6 million.",107,,
821,0.97,5574.735,5575.169,11% reduction.,108,,
822,0.97,5575.169,5577.805,"Sorry, had to change the notes up here.",108,,
823,0.97,5577.805,5581.242,And so that's an 11% reduction.,108,,
824,0.97,5581.242,5593.421,"And the Council has specified in the CBA that it is the intent of the Council that that reduction be to the extent possible, directed towards events and demonstrations.",108,,
825,0.97,5593.421,5600.361,"And that the--the departments begin to track events and demonstrations specifically demonstrations, separately.",108,,
826,0.97,5600.361,5605.7,So that the Council can make sure that the cut is being directed that way.,108,,
827,0.97,5605.7,5610.571,The--the next component is a travel and training cut.,108,,
828,0.97,5610.571,5617.445,The Council has asked the Department to find efficiencies in its travel and training expenditures.,108,,
829,0.97,5617.445,5621.916,"Such that they would be able to not spend $175,000.",108,,
830,0.97,5621.916,5628.456,This might include things like going to Video conferences instead of traveling to conferences.,108,,
831,0.97,5628.456,5634.095,The overall travel and training budget is $1.1 million.,108,,
832,0.97,5634.095,5639.567,"And so by cutting $175,000, it would leave $925,000.",108,,
833,0.97,5639.567,5650.745,"And then the last piece of this cut is a $300,000 cut to the discretionary purchase budget.",108,,
834,0.97,5650.745,5661.389,"And that is a $4.4 million budget and after the $300,000 cut, that would bring it down to $4.1 million budget.",108,,
835,0.97,5661.389,5667.495,"And again, the Council is seeking that the Department find efficiencies in its spending.",108,,
836,0.97,5667.495,5668.062,Thank you.,109,,
837,0.97,5668.062,5670.898,Thank you Council member Herbold for the work that you have done.,109,,
838,0.97,5670.898,5677.772,And I will turn it over to you and I will NOTE Greg I'm interested in this and some of the other amendments.,109,,
839,0.97,5677.772,5684.345,How we can help communicate to folks in the community that there are not cuts in some areas.,109,,
840,0.97,5684.345,5685.046,Whole cloth cuts.,109,,
841,0.97,5685.046,5685.646,There are some reductions.,109,,
842,0.97,5685.646,5691.285,And some items that are proposed to be held off on.,109,,
843,0.97,5691.285,5691.752,Are new items.,109,,
844,0.97,5691.752,5707.501,I think that would be an important distinction so people don't think that the existing funding for SPD is being reduced by this amount or there's any misinformation--misunderstanding about existing staff being cut.,109,,
845,0.97,5707.501,5709.236,"Council member Herbold, please go ahead.",109,,
846,0.97,5709.236,5710.137,Thank you.,110,,
847,0.97,5710.137,5712.373,Just to--quick note.,110,,
848,0.97,5712.373,5715.242,"On the overtime reduction, of a 11%.",110,,
849,0.97,5715.242,5723.417,That's a reduction of 11% over what the Mayor proposed and I believe it's an increase over--2021?,110,,
850,0.97,5723.417,5726.487,Or is the it the same as 2021?,110,,
851,0.97,5726.487,5732.893,It actually is an increase over the 2021 budget.,111,,
852,0.97,5732.893,5747.174,The--the 2021 budget was a $21.8 million budget so this is providing the Department with more overtime funds than they had this year.,111,,
853,0.97,5747.174,5751.612,They will have $26.4 million in 2022.,111,,
854,0.97,5751.612,5752.046,Very helpful.,112,,
855,0.97,5752.046,5752.346,Thank you.,112,,
856,0.97,5752.346,5756.984,Good to understand that this is actually an increase over 2021.,112,,
857,0.97,5756.984,5764.058,With the understanding that things are going to continue to open up and there will be additional events.,112,,
858,0.97,5764.058,5786.514,"But I just want to remind my colleagues as well as the viewing public is that we have a strong interest, shared strong interest, in ensuring that to the extent possible, events can be staffed with overtime, not--patrol officer overtime.",112,,
859,0.97,5786.514,5792.686,"But to the extent possible, parking enforcement officer overtime.",112,,
860,0.97,5792.686,5804.899,"Because we really, really want police officers to be focused on using overtime to the extent they need to use overtime to fulfill their core law enforcement mission.",112,,
861,0.97,5804.899,5825.753,And there's currently a--a memorandum of understanding between s PD--between Spog and the parking enforcement officers that allows there to be shared staffing of--of special events.,112,,
862,0.97,5825.753,5830.691,"And recognizes within that agreement itself, that there may be fluctuation from year to year.",112,,
863,0.97,5830.691,5832.66,Event to event.,112,,
864,0.97,5832.66,5833.494,A month to month.,112,,
865,0.97,5833.494,5839.166,In who is getting more of those overtime hours.,112,,
866,0.97,5839.166,5840.334,Police officers or parking enforcement officers.,112,,
867,0.97,5840.334,5861.121,"We want to see more of those hours to the extent possible to Te extent that it's safe, going to the parking enforcement officers and I think we have a really good argument for the folks who are administering that overtime.",112,,
868,0.97,5861.121,5868.462,That we have a law enforcement need to ensure that more hours are going to parking enforcement officers.,112,,
869,0.97,5868.462,5888.749,"To the extent there are concerns about the--memorandum of understanding between Spog and Spag that allows both, I--I think there is ample reason to tip more of the hours going to parking enforcement officers.",112,,
870,0.97,5888.749,5898.626,So that the hours that police officers are doing on overtime are really focused on their core law enforcement mission.,112,,
871,0.97,5898.626,5898.859,Thanks.,112,,
872,0.97,5898.859,5903.03,Thank you Council member Herbold for that explanation and again to my question for central staff.,113,,
873,0.97,5903.03,5915.242,And perhaps this is a graphic that we can have from our communications team to show where items are being proposed as reductions in the proposed budget does not equal a cut in the existing budget.,113,,
874,0.97,5915.242,5915.542,Sometimes?,113,,
875,0.97,5915.542,5915.776,Right?,113,,
876,0.97,5915.776,5916.543,That's what we're talking about.,113,,
877,0.97,5916.543,5919.179,So that would be very helpful to see.,113,,
878,0.97,5919.179,5920.114,"Council member Pedersen, please go ahead.",113,,
879,0.97,5920.114,5922.383,"Yes, thank you chairman Mosqueda.",114,,
880,0.97,5922.383,5924.818,Just following up on the overtime question.,114,,
881,0.97,5924.818,5926.12,I had earlier.,114,,
882,0.97,5926.12,5951.312,"Thanks for getting to that item so I guess even if--so my concern is if we're assuming additional separations, but then we're--we're also adjusting the overtime budget, I'm concerned that the overtime budget would then need to go up if we're assuming additional separations.",114,,
883,0.97,5951.312,5963.257,"So I support what Council member Herbold was saying about having a more efficient deployment during events so that you know, we have our parking enforcement officers in that--in that mix.",114,,
884,0.97,5963.257,5972.132,"At the same time, I'm just--concerned about the overall imbalance if we're assuming additional separations of staff.",114,,
885,0.97,5972.132,5979.206,I would think the overtime budget would then need to increase to--so that we have sufficient 911 response times.,114,,
886,0.97,5979.206,5985.579,And as Greg mentioned it is increased.,115,,
887,0.97,5985.579,5988.615,Or the 2021.,115,,
888,0.97,5988.615,5989.016,Overtime budget.,115,,
889,0.97,5989.016,5993.654,Overtime budget in 2022 is increased over the 2021 budget.,116,,
890,0.97,5993.654,6002.663,And we're also making sure to preserve and invest in parking enforcement officers.,116,,
891,0.97,6002.663,6003.13,At central staff.,116,,
892,0.97,6003.13,6009.536,Did you have anything else to add to Council member Pedersen's question or comment?,116,,
893,0.97,6009.536,6045.706,"Only to say that if it is the case that the Department cannot isolate--cannot isolate--well, to say that if patrol Augmentation is needed, in a way that can't be provided for within the existing overtime budget, because the staffing reductions are--are a problem, then they would need to come back to the Council for more authority.",117,,
894,0.97,6045.706,6051.912,But that is not something that is maybe Knowable right now.,117,,
895,0.97,6051.912,6058.952,Given that we are in a place where events are just starting back up.,117,,
896,0.97,6058.952,6062.89,And some are starting up quicker than others.,117,,
897,0.97,6062.89,6075.936,"So I would say at this point in time, it is--it's again a matter of assumptions.",117,,
898,0.97,6075.936,6079.373,"Council member Herbold, anything to add?",118,,
899,0.97,6079.373,6079.54,No.,118,,
900,0.97,6079.54,6079.74,Okay.,118,,
901,0.97,6079.74,6083.277,"Ally, did you have anything to add?",118,,
902,0.97,6083.277,6084.645,"Esther, anything on this item?",118,,
903,0.97,6084.645,6084.912,Nope.,119,,
904,0.97,6084.912,6087.181,Happy to cover the last two items when you are ready.,119,,
905,0.97,6087.181,6095.923,I appreciate it and then I think we'll get into what is included section of our agenda.,120,,
906,0.97,6095.923,6096.824,"Appreciate the conversation, colleagues.",120,,
907,0.97,6096.824,6102.896,I do hope that you have been able to get some clarity on the information that has been out there.,120,,
908,0.97,6102.896,6105.165,And thank you Greg for walking us through this.,120,,
909,0.97,6105.165,6119.78,And to again reiterate that we will follow up with all of you so that this information is clear and there are absolutely every single position to the Mayor has planned to hire currently included in this budget.,120,,
910,0.97,6119.78,6121.248,There's still an increase in overtime.,120,,
911,0.97,6121.248,6129.49,There are still investments in information technology systems that the court monitor specifically has said are prudent.,120,,
912,0.97,6129.49,6132.693,There are maintaining our community service officers.,120,,
913,0.97,6132.693,6137.764,And another conversation to happen about where the best place to house those.,120,,
914,0.97,6137.764,6148.609,This is all in addition to the $27 million in community safety investments and stability investments that we will be talking about here momentarily.,120,,
915,0.97,6148.609,6155.782,$27Million into what helps create stable healthy communities that hopefully reduce chances that individuals are interacting with other officers in the first place.,120,,
916,0.97,6155.782,6170.197,And we will get into some very specific examples of alternative responses to police responses but everything that we have talked about today should help clarify that there are not cuts to existing officers.,120,,
917,0.97,6170.197,6173.433,That there are not cuts to overtime.,120,,
918,0.97,6173.433,6187.447,And that we remain committed to making sure that we are Transitioning to investments in community and in a way that is balanced with investments into our traditional policing as well.,120,,
919,0.97,6187.447,6194.755,Lots of work to do on this and lock forward to hearing more as we talk about the investments we're making.,120,,
920,0.97,6194.755,6198.125,"Please go ahead, Esther.",120,,
921,0.97,6198.125,6198.425,Great.,121,,
922,0.97,6198.425,6204.565,The final two resources listed on this chart are revenue.,121,,
923,0.97,6204.565,6220.38,The first is this balancing package recognizes $26.2 million of real estate excise tax and Uptick in projected--we call that Re-Revenue from that November forecast.,121,,
924,0.97,6220.38,6224.051,"In the balancing package, it is used in several ways.",121,,
925,0.97,6224.051,6233.26,The first $8.4 million of it is used to pay debt service that was planned to be paid with commercial parking tax.,121,,
926,0.97,6233.26,6247.007,"As we mentioned earlier, we project an $8.4 million decrease in commercial parking tax this strategy to use Reet instead of Cpt demonstrates the city's use of its full faith and credit.",121,,
927,0.97,6247.007,6251.511,To pay our creditors on necessary debt service.,121,,
928,0.97,6251.511,6258.118,Another $6.8 million is used to free up general fund resources in two ways.,121,,
929,0.97,6258.118,6262.723,$2.3Million of it replaces commercial parking tax and transportation CIP projects.,121,,
930,0.97,6262.723,6269.93,That commercial parking tax is then used to replace general fund resources in the transportation operating budget.,121,,
931,0.97,6269.93,6274.501,Freeing up general funds for use elsewhere in the budget.,121,,
932,0.97,6274.501,6284.645,The other swap is that $4.35 million of this supports capital expenditures budgeted from the cumulative Reserve sub Fund.,121,,
933,0.97,6284.645,6288.682,That offsets other Crsu revenues transferred to the general fund.,121,,
934,0.97,6288.682,6295.255,The balance of the revenues are used for Reet eligible capital projects in the budget.,121,,
935,0.97,6295.255,6303.864,Those are largely transportation and parks budgets and where they--are used you will see them listed on the specific budget actions.,121,,
936,0.97,6303.864,6316.877,The final use of Reet is that this package allocates $3.1 million of Reet for debt service related to new bond authorization which we will touch on briefly in a moment.,121,,
937,0.97,6316.877,6321.882,Any questions about Reet?,121,,
938,0.97,6321.882,6322.883,Thank you.,122,,
939,0.97,6322.883,6342.636,For helping us be able to use these funds in a way that I think invests in our infrastructure and will help us build that more connected city of the future so we have more to talk about on how the dollars are current being allocated here in the budget momentarily and on the commercial parking tax.,122,,
940,0.97,6342.636,6345.038,Thank you for bringing this amendment forward.,122,,
941,0.97,6345.038,6358.518,Happy to have been able to work with you to allocate those dollars to Council members priorities right now and also some desired Investmens overall the Council has seen over the last few years.,122,,
942,0.97,6358.518,6362.789,I think this is significant opportunity for us to make these investments now.,122,,
943,0.97,6362.789,6362.989,Okay.,122,,
944,0.97,6362.989,6368.428,Let's get on to the next one.,122,,
945,0.97,6368.428,6370.497,"Great, yes, you mentioned the commercial parking tax.",123,,
946,0.97,6370.497,6378.405,This is 2% increase in the commercial parking tax projected to generate $2.9 million next year and twice that annually beginning in 2023.,123,,
947,0.97,6378.405,6387.647,And only item that's not on this table but is a significant resource that we will discuss in the transportation section is this package also authorized.,123,,
948,0.97,6387.647,6393.553,The city to issue up to $100 million of bonds for bridge repair and maintenance in 2022.,123,,
949,0.97,6393.553,6400.66,And appropriates the first year of debt service requesting the executive prepare a report for issuance by March.,123,,
950,0.97,6400.66,6404.865,We'll pick that conversation up when we get to the transportation section.,123,,
951,0.97,6404.865,6415.308,"With that, I think we are at the end of resources and I can turn it over to my colleague ally to begin discussion on investments.",123,,
952,0.97,6415.308,6420.58,New other questions or comments on the resources section of the presentation?,124,,
953,0.97,6420.58,6420.781,Okay.,124,,
954,0.97,6420.781,6424.084,We're going to turn it over to ally.,124,,
955,0.97,6424.084,6427.154,Usually in the morning meetings go until 1:00 P.M.,124,,
956,0.97,6427.154,6433.727,We usually do go to that Full- time so we'll have Coo chance to go through all of the proposed budget actions and in front of us.,124,,
957,0.97,6433.727,6457.751,"Ally is going to give us a--overview of each of the categories which as you saw in the earlier presentations we are--combining together with themes so you will see each Council member's name associated to their CBA, their Council budget action to reflect the amendment they Prioritized but that will give you a general sense of the themes we have Prioritized for the chair's budget package here today.",124,,
958,0.97,6457.751,6460.821,"Ally, thank you for your work.",124,,
959,0.97,6460.821,6463.089,Good to see you again.,124,,
960,0.97,6463.089,6463.69,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,125,,
961,0.97,6463.69,6465.992,"We can move on to the next slide, Patty.",125,,
962,0.97,6465.992,6468.895,Thank you.,125,,
963,0.97,6468.895,6474.835,So I will now walk through a summary of what is in the Planing package.,125,,
964,0.97,6474.835,6485.679,Will not spend as much time focusing on the pieces that are freeing up resources and we'll be discussing this in the four themes and priority areas that the chair just described.,125,,
965,0.97,6485.679,6491.418,"Administration, affordable housing and homeless services, connected community and thriving economy, and healthy and safe communities.",125,,
966,0.97,6491.418,6504.064,So I'll walk through each of the sub categories and let you have in front Ofsy is a summary table that shows resources identified.,125,,
967,0.97,6504.064,6519.946,What the total increased spending or Reprogram spending is in the ads column and then the total that nets out the combination of those--of those two numbers.,125,,
968,0.97,6519.946,6535.362,It is primarily comprised of Council budget actions that pass or adopt Council bills and resolutions or file clerk files that are necessary to adopt the budget but we will focus more on the council member amendments today.,125,,
969,0.97,6535.362,6544.07,So if we can move to the next slide.,125,,
970,0.97,6544.07,6550.043,And I'll just--NOTE here--that I--let's see here.,125,,
971,0.97,6550.043,6560.287,"I transposed a couple of numbers so the administration category, there's a total of $14.8 million in spending.",125,,
972,0.97,6560.287,6562.255,And there's $44.8 million in resources.,125,,
973,0.97,6562.255,6567.928,I typed in the total number there in resources so I just want to highlight that first.,125,,
974,0.97,6567.928,6569.429,Just a correction for the record.,125,,
975,0.97,6569.429,6571.464,Please say that one more time?,126,,
976,0.97,6571.464,6571.698,Yes.,127,,
977,0.97,6571.698,6574.901,So you can see in the summary table at the top.,127,,
978,0.97,6574.901,6581.975,The numbers are correct in there's $14.8 million of spending in this category.,127,,
979,0.97,6581.975,6588.782,And there's $44.8 million of resources.,127,,
980,0.97,6588.782,6589.082,The total.,127,,
981,0.97,6589.082,6596.556,"The net, is 29-Point--$29.9 million reduction in the category--thank you Patty.",127,,
982,0.97,6596.556,6609.903,That is primarily the--amount of resources made available in the actions within this category are primarily from the omnibus amendment.,127,,
983,0.97,6609.903,6613.239,Fg00 1B001 sponsored by chair Mosqueda.,127,,
984,0.97,6613.239,6616.743,There are a number of actions in that amendment.,127,,
985,0.97,6616.743,6633.827,I suggest people spend some time reading the attachment and I will also tease out some of the details that relate to some of the other categories in the proposal like affordable housing and economic revitalization as we are walking through.,127,,
986,0.97,6633.827,6640.734,But that's the main amendment that frees up the bulk of the resources that were used to support the balancing package.,127,,
987,0.97,6640.734,6645.839,I will also just highlight a few other items that are included in this category.,127,,
988,0.97,6645.839,6648.608,And then open it--then turn it back to the Claire.,127,,
989,0.97,6648.608,6657.517,This includes a--amendment sponsored by Council her Herbold requesting a report from the city budget office on city-wide hiring incentive programs.,127,,
990,0.97,6657.517,6664.19,Although I believe that may be was Mislabeled.,127,,
991,0.97,6664.19,6671.598,"Parole Sal by Council member Pedersen that adds $300,000 to the I. T. Department for Multifactor authentication.",127,,
992,0.97,6671.598,6679.406,And there it is also a funding sponsored by Council member Morales to add money to implement a Juneteenth holiday in the city.,127,,
993,0.97,6679.406,6685.612,So that was just a few of the highlights and I'll turn it back to the compare and happy to answer questions.,127,,
994,0.97,6685.612,6686.546,Thank you very much.,128,,
995,0.97,6686.546,6699.159,I do see Council member Herbold's hand up and before we do that I want to just make a quick clarification as well about sponsorship.,128,,
996,0.97,6699.159,6699.359,Ally.,128,,
997,0.97,6699.359,6704.097,It might be helpful for folks--it's usually if there's been a major change to a proposed amendment.,128,,
998,0.97,6704.097,6712.372,I think the one that you are Referencing that Council member Herbold's name was there we'll explain a little bit about the hybrid approach that I was suggesting here.,128,,
999,0.97,6712.372,6715.108,And I think it was supposed to have my name.,128,,
1000,0.97,6715.108,6723.65,But generally can you give folks a sense of when the budget chair's name is associated with an amendment?,128,,
1001,0.97,6723.65,6723.917,Yeah.,129,,
1002,0.97,6723.917,6732.225,As we you know we had seven amendments as well that we submitted but as you see there are a number of items that have my name next to it.,130,,
1003,0.97,6732.225,6733.96,"Yes, happy to chair.",131,,
1004,0.97,6733.96,6750.31,"So where there's your name specifically just typically amendments you proposed for discussion in the committee the 26th, 27th or 28th or in some cases your name should have been associated where there was a proposal by a council member that was modified in the package.",131,,
1005,0.97,6750.31,6757.016,And modified as such that it really wasn't as clearly--the original sponsor's goal.,131,,
1006,0.97,6757.016,6759.352,So your name would be associated with it.,131,,
1007,0.97,6759.352,6764.691,"And then also NOTE where you see BC, that is listed as budget committee.",131,,
1008,0.97,6764.691,6768.394,On the Council budget actions.,131,,
1009,0.97,6768.394,6779.706,So those amendments are amendments that adopt or passed budget legislation or freeing up resources to free up the package.,131,,
1010,0.97,6779.706,6781.441,It has been historically Lou the budget process has worked.,131,,
1011,0.97,6781.441,6786.779,Typically not a lot of Council member proposals that propose cuts.,131,,
1012,0.97,6786.779,6790.717,But in order to accommodate all the asks for you?,131,,
1013,0.97,6790.717,6795.855,Fending the chair has to incorporate amendments in order to free up resources in order to support the entire package.,131,,
1014,0.97,6795.855,6799.893,So the majority of those are labeled as budget committee.,131,,
1015,0.97,6799.893,6804.631,"Thank you for that clarification, council member Herbold.",132,,
1016,0.97,6804.631,6805.064,Please go ahead.,132,,
1017,0.97,6805.064,6805.431,Thank you.,133,,
1018,0.97,6805.431,6812.305,This--may be what you are getting at Madame chair.,133,,
1019,0.97,6812.305,6826.786,"I believe that the CBA or the--Yeah, the CBA that I sponsored which is 13A001.",133,,
1020,0.97,6826.786,6831.691,Did not include a cut.,133,,
1021,0.97,6831.691,6836.596,"For the--well, it moved the money into Finance general.",133,,
1022,0.97,6836.596,6837.864,Was the action.,133,,
1023,0.97,6837.864,6842.669,And that is no longer the action being contemplated.,133,,
1024,0.97,6842.669,6843.369,Correct?,133,,
1025,0.97,6843.369,6865.225,My interest was wanting to preserve the funds for a potential future bonus program that would--that would help recruitment in departments that would be informed by analysis that we would get from the executive.,133,,
1026,0.97,6865.225,6878.638,This proposal still requests the analysis but no longer includes parking the funds for a later use so it's different than the proposal that I made.,133,,
1027,0.97,6878.638,6880.039,"That's correct, council member Herbold.",134,,
1028,0.97,6880.039,6883.743,The cut is in a separate CBA and not associated with you.,134,,
1029,0.97,6883.743,6899.058,"This is just the request for the report and I will just NOTE just to be really honest about it, we were moving very quickly and so there are some errors and we will get those corrected and get the correct numbers and names posted on the Yda.",134,,
1030,0.97,6899.058,6904.03,I am hoping there's not too many more.,134,,
1031,0.97,6904.03,6904.43,But I apologize.,134,,
1032,0.97,6904.43,6904.731,In public.,134,,
1033,0.97,6904.731,6911.304,"For errors we are you know, moving quickly and sometimes moving quickly it's hard to get things accurate.",134,,
1034,0.97,6911.304,6913.873,I appreciate the opportunity to make those corrections.,134,,
1035,0.97,6913.873,6914.707,Oh good.,135,,
1036,0.97,6914.707,6916.009,Thank you.,135,,
1037,0.97,6916.009,6917.21,All good is right.,136,,
1038,0.97,6917.21,6921.414,Thank you vice chair and we will have my name associated with that request for the report.,136,,
1039,0.97,6921.414,6927.053,I wanted to credit you for reminding us that there was a two part element to your original proposal.,136,,
1040,0.97,6927.053,6927.854,And it did include that report.,136,,
1041,0.97,6927.854,6930.657,We didn't want that report to get lost.,136,,
1042,0.97,6930.657,6942.402,"So as you note, and as you noted and ally noted as well, again, recognizing that this is a--bad news budget when we got the revenue forecast last week.",136,,
1043,0.97,6942.402,6952.045,Looking for opportunities to use funding that would have otherwise sat to the side for awhile.,136,,
1044,0.97,6952.045,6962.088,Have utilized them in the proposed budget given the pending information I'd like to receive from the report and the poll sill conversation that I think is needed with this Council.,136,,
1045,0.97,6962.088,6968.194,"And instead of parking it in finance--parking it and holding for a while, I have suggested utilizing it and given the urgent needs out there.",136,,
1046,0.97,6968.194,6974.834,So thank you for helping to clarify that and for allowing for me to have a chance to speak to the differences there too.,136,,
1047,0.97,6974.834,6983.176,Thank you ally for also noting that you will will working to try to amend this document.,136,,
1048,0.97,6983.176,6983.509,No problems.,136,,
1049,0.97,6983.509,6994.721,Just happy to have the issues identified by Council members so the document that's posted to the agenda the product and we can address any of the immediate issues before it gets posted.,136,,
1050,0.97,6994.721,6999.792,Do note that name will change on that one.,136,,
1051,0.97,6999.792,7002.895,Any other items please feel free to go ahead and flag it.,136,,
1052,0.97,7002.895,7003.997,"Again, central staff no problem.",136,,
1053,0.97,7003.997,7009.469,We know how busy you all have been working and really Apreciate this spread sheet here.,136,,
1054,0.97,7009.469,7016.342,So--I do want to give ally the chance to walk through any other items that you'd like to flag for colleagues in is this N section.,136,,
1055,0.97,7016.342,7026.953,Any other pieces you'd like to lift up and then I'll ask also Council colleagues if there's any pieces you would like to lit you have.,136,,
1056,0.97,7026.953,7030.89,No CBO and explanation in the overview today.,136,,
1057,0.97,7030.89,7036.029,This is your chance Council colleagues to help call attention to ones you are really excited about.,136,,
1058,0.97,7036.029,7057.016,We have limited time but offered that so you can flag for members of the public key items you have really excited about and ally of course feel free to lift up as many of the council member actions that you--think are appropriate to really flag for the purposes of our discussion as well.,136,,
1059,0.97,7057.016,7058.785,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,137,,
1060,0.97,7058.785,7065.591,"I didn't have additional attempts to flag and this category like I said is mainly budget, budget legislation.",137,,
1061,0.97,7065.591,7077.236,And that sort of happy to discuss one.,137,,
1062,0.97,7077.236,7079.038,The Omni bus amendment we're making here.,137,,
1063,0.97,7079.038,7092.718,The importance of not just making sure that the color of money is correct but when we use jump start revenue as intended in our spend plan that helps to build those investments into the base budget for future years.,137,,
1064,0.97,7092.718,7104.13,If we had not made these changes in affordable housing we would have seen half of the investments that jump start was originally intending to make disappear at the end of the year with the use of one time funds.,137,,
1065,0.97,7104.13,7114.44,It is really important that we not only stay true to that spend plan but that we're creating greater stability and that we stay true to our spend plan for community partners.,137,,
1066,0.97,7114.44,7117.844,That's what we've committed to in this proposed budget.,137,,
1067,0.97,7117.844,7121.948,Including maintaining our commitment to investing in Bipoc communities.,137,,
1068,0.97,7121.948,7134.26,Investing in the community safety grants and gun violence reduction strategies.,137,,
1069,0.97,7134.26,7134.827,In Participatory budgeting.,137,,
1070,0.97,7134.827,7139.432,Showing those investments 7:00 to the same investment amendment we had committed to next year.,137,,
1071,0.97,7139.432,7145.638,Making sure there are no cuts in those proposed amounts we have committed.,137,,
1072,0.97,7145.638,7151.077,Receiving $30 million in this year's budget.,137,,
1073,0.97,7151.077,7158.117,Participatory budgeting still having 30 million.,137,,
1074,0.97,7158.117,7165.224,The human services community safety grants and $4 million going into youth violence and gun reduction strategies.,137,,
1075,0.97,7165.224,7175.268,Very excited about the opportunity to bring this forward and thank you central staff for all the work you did on the big one.,137,,
1076,0.97,7175.268,7176.235,Let's move on.,137,,
1077,0.97,7176.235,7180.206,We will move on to the next category.,138,,
1078,0.97,7180.206,7184.911,If we move on to the affordable housing page.,138,,
1079,0.97,7184.911,7191.45,"So this, the next two summary tables are related to the affordable housing and homeless services category.",138,,
1080,0.97,7191.45,7197.557,In total the package includes just over $18 million of spending in these categories.,138,,
1081,0.97,7197.557,7221.881,This is in addition to the $97.9 million of jump start funds that in the amendment are fully attributed to the jump start Fund and that ensures that in it an on going way that funding will more than double the base amount of funding annually.,138,,
1082,0.97,7221.881,7222.682,In future years budgets.,138,,
1083,0.97,7222.682,7225.251,Where that is happening I've noted that.,138,,
1084,0.97,7225.251,7233.96,In the affordable housing category the balancing package includes $2.6 million of spending on top of that 97.7 million.,138,,
1085,0.97,7233.96,7240.099,Before I highlight a few of the amendments I'm going to turn to my colleague.,138,,
1086,0.97,7240.099,7249.242,I want her to highlight a piece of the Omni bus amendment that's not listed here but we've had some questions about.,138,,
1087,0.97,7249.242,7264.223,The Omni bus amendment does swap the fund source for proposal to ensure that there are services to support units that are supported by emergency housing vouchers as well as City-Funded permanent part of housing units.,138,,
1088,0.97,7264.223,7266.892,"Tracy, do you want to add more there?",138,,
1089,0.97,7266.892,7272.531,"You've done a great job of summarizing but just to be clear, yes.",139,,
1090,0.97,7272.531,7280.139,We are proposing to use 2021 Underspend emergency services grant as well as Cliffer funds to the tune of $6.9 million.,139,,
1091,0.97,7280.139,7294.82,"That will be used to fund those services both for the vouchers as well as for office of housing, permanent supportive housing and permanent affordable housing with units that need services dollars.",139,,
1092,0.97,7294.82,7307.166,In the Admin section there is the two Cbas that get us that cut and then appropriate those funds directly to the office of housing for those purposes.,139,,
1093,0.97,7307.166,7320.746,"That funding will be provided for one year and our expectation is that we're going to try to secure some Federal, state and county funds to help fill the gap for those services going forward, as well as obviously city funds in 2023 and beyond.",139,,
1094,0.97,7320.746,7336.562,It's also expected that Oh would work in collaboration with the King County regional homeless authority and the Seattle housing authority on the distribution of the services for the vouchers in particular because they are fundamentally involved in that effort.,139,,
1095,0.97,7336.562,7345.204,So that all goes along with the cuts and the ads that happen in those two other Cbas under the Admin section.,139,,
1096,0.97,7345.204,7352.745,"Again, it will amount to about 6.9 million in 2022 to cover the services for those two components.",139,,
1097,0.97,7352.745,7353.612,Thank you.,140,,
1098,0.97,7353.612,7366.258,"And through those actions what that does overall is it also restores about $6 million in the jump start fund into the affordable, multifamily housing category.",140,,
1099,0.97,7366.258,7375.368,Through that it's about a $6 million overall increase in investments in affordable housing on top of these other actions included in the package.,140,,
1100,0.97,7375.368,7376.902,So I'll just highlight a few.,140,,
1101,0.97,7376.902,7380.639,Not in any order of importance.,140,,
1102,0.97,7380.639,7383.909,All of the amendments I know are priorities for the Council.,140,,
1103,0.97,7383.909,7384.944,Just to highlight a few.,140,,
1104,0.97,7384.944,7389.882,We just zoom in just one more time just to see.,141,,
1105,0.97,7389.882,7391.417,I like it.,141,,
1106,0.97,7391.417,7393.252,Thank you very much.,141,,
1107,0.97,7393.252,7393.552,Excellent.,141,,
1108,0.97,7393.552,7395.955,Thank you.,142,,
1109,0.97,7395.955,7397.49,"Thank you, Patty.",143,,
1110,0.97,7397.49,7409.201,"So Oh-7 B 1 sponsored by Council member Juarez would add $250,000 for Predevelopment costs for an affordable housing project.",144,,
1111,0.97,7409.201,7430.422,Would add funding to the Seattle Department of construction and inspection for consultant support for rental market study and adding staffing support for policy development and implementation of work around tenant protections and landlord.,144,,
1112,0.97,7430.422,7440.166,And another amendment sponsored by Council member Sawant for the Department of inspections.,144,,
1113,0.97,7440.166,7449.208,$1.5Million to add staffing and other support implement the economic displacement relocation of assistance ordinance that the council passed earlier this year.,144,,
1114,0.97,7449.208,7463.289,There are also a number of slides that are looking for partnerships with food banks and the Community-Based organizations who have received rental assistance grants sponsored by Council member Strauss.,144,,
1115,0.97,7463.289,7484.743,An amendment sponsored by chair Mosqueda that she referred to earlier or yesterday ensuring there is clear policy direction from the Council for the office of housing to recognize 2022 appropriations to support projects that applied for funding through the 2021 notice of funding availability if they are ready to be funded.,144,,
1116,0.97,7484.743,7496.856,So I'll pause there if there are other items Council members would like to discuss or ask questions about.,144,,
1117,0.97,7496.856,7497.89,Council members any questions?,145,,
1118,0.97,7497.89,7500.826,"Okay, this is an area I'm very excited about obviously.",145,,
1119,0.97,7500.826,7506.665,I do want to note these are the changes that we have made to the budget.,145,,
1120,0.97,7506.665,7515.841,"The overall investments in affordable housing, colleagues, is a record $192 million in affordable housing and supportive services.",145,,
1121,0.97,7515.841,7517.176,I am incredibly proud of this.,145,,
1122,0.97,7517.176,7524.183,It would not be possible without your support for that spend plan on jump start and all of the work you're doing to complement the housing investments.,145,,
1123,0.97,7524.183,7534.66,Want to take a brief second to thank Emily who has been at the helm of the office of housing over the last few years and we wish her the best of luck as she transitions to her new job.,145,,
1124,0.97,7534.66,7555.08,Excited to work with the next housing director and the interim director and I look forward to working with all of you on this Council and members of the community so we can have more R community driven affordable housing projects that really create ownership and license and Self- determination on affordable housing efforts.,145,,
1125,0.97,7555.08,7558.817,"Council member Juarez, would you like to make any comments here?",145,,
1126,0.97,7558.817,7562.488,"Well, I turn my camera on by accident.",146,,
1127,0.97,7562.488,7567.526,"Since you sound like Oprah, I'm happy that you're excited and we all get cars.",146,,
1128,0.97,7567.526,7567.86,Thank you.,146,,
1129,0.97,7567.86,7571.73,Only wish I could say and you get a house and you get a house and you get a house.,147,,
1130,0.97,7571.73,7578.203,That is what we are working towards here.,147,,
1131,0.97,7578.203,7578.637,Thank you.,148,,
1132,0.97,7578.637,7585.244,If there's not any additional comments I do want to also thank Tracy leading up this effort.,148,,
1133,0.97,7585.244,7588.013,We had a chance to hear from her a moment ago.,148,,
1134,0.97,7588.013,7595.754,Also Jeff Simms who has overlapping areas of interest as it relates to keeping folks securely housed so they don't fall into homelessness.,148,,
1135,0.97,7595.754,7598.357,Appreciate the work you've done.,148,,
1136,0.97,7598.357,7602.828,Specifically on that $6.9 million component that was just explained.,148,,
1137,0.97,7602.828,7615.975,There's no questions Pausing for questions or any other items Council members would like to identify or lift up or for your colleagues.,148,,
1138,0.97,7615.975,7616.642,Okay.,148,,
1139,0.97,7616.642,7617.576,Please go ahead.,148,,
1140,0.97,7617.576,7618.01,"Excuse me, Aly.",148,,
1141,0.97,7618.01,7633.192,"I just since Council members are being a little shy here, I'm going to go ahead and thank a few folks I want to thank all of the folks who have been working on the housing stability efforts to work to expand access to affordable housing.",148,,
1142,0.97,7633.192,7655.681,"You have done a tremendous amount when we get to this next section of making sure more people have affordable housing options as an exit from shelters and from our temporary housing solutions and creating housing stability is truly the answer to getting more people out of the streets, out of parks, out of tents and into somewhere safe to live with the support of services.",148,,
1143,0.97,7655.681,7656.982,That's what this investment offers.,148,,
1144,0.97,7656.982,7659.385,This is the solution to homelessness.,148,,
1145,0.97,7659.385,7671.73,"By making sure people have housing and the health services that accompany it which will round out our discussion today, this budget is informing along that spectrum to make sure everybody gets a chance to have access to fair housing.",148,,
1146,0.97,7671.73,7681.14,We have not been able to accomplish that fully in this budget alone and we know it's going to rely on regional partners to step up.,148,,
1147,0.97,7681.14,7693.352,"Reminder report says we need at least $450,000 a year--excuse me, $450 million to 1 billion a year in our region to invest in affordable housing.",148,,
1148,0.97,7693.352,7696.555,I'm proud we're near $2 million in Seattle alone.,148,,
1149,0.97,7696.555,7704.53,So thank you and I'll have more to say when we get to the homeless services component.,148,,
1150,0.97,7704.53,7704.83,Thank you.,148,,
1151,0.97,7704.83,7711.97,"With that we can move on to the affordable, excuse me.",149,,
1152,0.97,7711.97,7713.972,The homeless services table.,149,,
1153,0.97,7713.972,7727.219,So in this Subcategory there is 15.4 million proposals and a number of statements of legislative requesting additional information.,149,,
1154,0.97,7727.219,7737.096,In this category includes amendment Hom 4 B 1 proposed by Council member Strauss.,149,,
1155,0.97,7737.096,7743.535,"This adds $100,000 to maintain resident outreach.",149,,
1156,0.97,7743.535,7754.98,12 B 1 would add $5 million to services Department to address facility needs to expand high Acuity shelter and behavioral health services in partnership with the county.,149,,
1157,0.97,7754.98,7773.465,"I should also now's just NOTE as I'm highlighting a few of these, we do have Jeff Simms on the line if there are specific questions about these proposals as well as the rest of the central staff team to support discussions in other categories.",149,,
1158,0.97,7773.465,7784.777,There is a proposal sponsored by Council member Mosqueda that is adding one time increase to service provider contracts.,149,,
1159,0.97,7784.777,7798.223,"Also a Hsd 1 B 1. then a proposal by Council member Sawant that adds $1 million to Sbu for recreational vehicle, waste water and cleanup services.",149,,
1160,0.97,7798.223,7812.671,"Throughout the proposals you see a number of amendments that are providing additional resources for the service providers, addressing people living in vehicles and Rvs.",149,,
1161,0.97,7812.671,7834.593,Support for the new regional homeless authority including Hom 9 a 1 sponsored by Council member Lewis that provides additional support for the regional homelessness authority to ensure that they are from their first year of operating setup for success.,149,,
1162,0.97,7834.593,7835.294,I will pause there.,149,,
1163,0.97,7835.294,7839.598,I'm not seeing Council members jump in to champion their investments here.,150,,
1164,0.97,7839.598,7841.7,I will do that for them.,150,,
1165,0.97,7841.7,7845.437,Colleagues thank you for some of the overlapping priorities you've submitted here.,150,,
1166,0.97,7845.437,7855.414,We see that we are accelerating our investments in permanent affordable housing as we are also investing in creating greater stability for those living unsheltered.,150,,
1167,0.97,7855.414,7861.687,Living in their vehicles and wanting stability in the existing Noncongregate shelters they have.,150,,
1168,0.97,7861.687,7863.689,We are investing in construction.,150,,
1169,0.97,7863.689,7864.89,Acquisition of building and land.,150,,
1170,0.97,7864.89,7876.068,Supportive services and making sure that we have the temporary housing needed for those who are currently living unsheltered to have more opportunities to get inside.,150,,
1171,0.97,7876.068,7879.705,"We have expanded outreach, shelter staffing.",150,,
1172,0.97,7879.705,7885.21,"Services to bolster our ability to connect people with services if you look at the Antidepressants from Council member Strauss, Juarez and Lewis.",150,,
1173,0.97,7885.21,7892.918,If you look at amendments from Lewis and Sawant we have enhanced and expanded our shelter spaces.,150,,
1174,0.97,7892.918,7911.97,Thank you to Council member Lewis for the work you've included here with the regional home authority along with Council President Gonzalez to make sure there's investments in stability for the entity to create the administrative structure necessary to ensure success.,150,,
1175,0.97,7911.97,7924.883,"I want to thank King County executive and the King County Council for the work they're doing to create stability especially for high needs, high Acuity individuals living unsheltered in our community.",150,,
1176,0.97,7924.883,7936.728,Much of the conversation we have Teed up in this budget here that perhaps Council member Lewis will speak to really entails deep partnership with King County and the original homelessness authority.,150,,
1177,0.97,7936.728,7953.478,I look forward to successful efforts to make sure that we're addressing the high needs population that regional homelessness authority has identified and that we're building a strong proposal with our partners at King County that will then be handed over to Rha.,150,,
1178,0.97,7953.478,7954.613,"Council member Lewis, go ahead.",150,,
1179,0.97,7954.613,7956.014,Thank you.,151,,
1180,0.97,7956.014,7968.694,I just want to briefly touch on the really big impact that a lot of these investments are going to make on the ground with the on going crisis of chronic homelessness we witness every day.,151,,
1181,0.97,7968.694,7980.439,We know there are huge gaps in service and resource for people who are falling through the cracks who are not being served by our current shelter system.,151,,
1182,0.97,7980.439,7996.521,This new partnership with King County to build a new facility to address and expand high Acuity shelter and behavioral health services is a big step toward closing that gap.,151,,
1183,0.97,7996.521,8002.728,I do want to say something that Migt be the elephant in the room.,151,,
1184,0.97,8002.728,8008.4,Historically we have not been expected to invest in behavioral health services.,151,,
1185,0.97,8008.4,8020.846,That is a function under how our government in Washington is set up that should be provided by the state and should be provided by the counties.,151,,
1186,0.97,8020.846,8030.088,"We cannot, however, stand idly by as the crisis of behavioral mental health that's playing out on the streets of Seattle continues to be Unaddressed by other levels of government.",151,,
1187,0.97,8030.088,8052.31,I think this is an equitable partnership between the county and the city to make sure we can go forward together and address that mutual high priority of closing that gap.,151,,
1188,0.97,8052.31,8056.515,Over the course of 2022 to meet the scale of the demand we see in our community.,151,,
1189,0.97,8056.515,8081.673,I do want to take a moment to acknowledge and appreciate Council member Mosqueda spending a comfortable amount of time both with my office and with the Renallal authority and county leadership to try to accommodate as much of the regional authority's request as we possibly could within the constraints that we have been experiencing.,151,,
1190,0.97,8081.673,8102.094,I acknowledge that Unfortunately we were not able to go as far as I wanted to go in centering some of these investments and I know as far as chair Mosqueda wanted to go but given the limitations I had to make difficult decisions to triage and Prioritize the most critical added investments in the sector.,151,,
1191,0.97,8102.094,8127.953,"I would hope as we go forward in 2022 that we Prioritize and resources recover ways to protect, preserve and expand programs like just care, which I just want to acknowledge falls between the cracks of this budget process.",151,,
1192,0.97,8127.953,8130.655,It is probably my greatest disappointment with the budget overall.,151,,
1193,0.97,8130.655,8155.313,I know that colleagues and chair Mosqueda share my disappointment that the situation has necessitated delaying plans beyond 2022 and this plan does not budget for that at the moment.,151,,
1194,0.97,8155.313,8179.304,Particularly stake holders downtown and Pioneer square who have been working with just care to address long standing chronic issues that just care is fully funded under the current arrangement until June of 2022 so there could still be time in supplemental budgets and planning between County and city to address that transition.,151,,
1195,0.97,8179.304,8184.509,Make sure we maintain that capacity we put in through that program.,151,,
1196,0.97,8184.509,8191.116,I do just want to signal my on going commitment to build on these investments.,151,,
1197,0.97,8191.116,8205.764,Really acknowledge the engagement of work of Council member Mosqueda in accommodating the real core of what we need to do to start meeting the demand we see in the street.,151,,
1198,0.97,8205.764,8215.774,This high Acuity sheltering asset is a very big help in addressing the issues that I know all of us hold in high priority.,151,,
1199,0.97,8215.774,8216.107,Thank you.,151,,
1200,0.97,8216.107,8220.145,"Thank you very much, council member Lewis.",152,,
1201,0.97,8220.145,8220.745,Council member Herbold.,152,,
1202,0.97,8220.745,8228.053,Just a couple points to make.,153,,
1203,0.97,8228.053,8235.894,Echoing appreciation for you chair Mosqueda for making this a high priority area.,153,,
1204,0.97,8235.894,8263.154,I will be sending to the IRC a resolution that can accompany our budget action and it really is focused on recognizing as Council member Lewis said that County has created and King County operates the integrated care network which encompasses all behavioral health providers in the county.,153,,
1205,0.97,8263.154,8266.224,Who provide Medicaid funded behavioral health services.,153,,
1206,0.97,8266.224,8291.65,"The fact we are acting more in this area with this budget cycle than we normally would because of the responsibility of King County and Washington State for areas associated with behavioral health, we are investing more than perhaps normally we would.",153,,
1207,0.97,8291.65,8301.493,But that is not intended to at all suggest that city of Seattle has authority in these areas.,153,,
1208,0.97,8301.493,8326.084,It's a recognition of the great need and the resolution is really focused on calling on County and Washington State to enhance our long term partnership with greater investments that recognize the increased need that we're seeing.,153,,
1209,0.97,8326.084,8332.624,Just want to put a finer point as it relates to urgency and just care.,153,,
1210,0.97,8332.624,8338.83,Council member Lewis is absolutely correct as it relates to the availability of funding through June.,153,,
1211,0.97,8338.83,8352.911,I just want to make sure that everybody understands assuming I'm understanding correctly because I think they call it a tail.,153,,
1212,0.97,8352.911,8366.658,There's a period of time when if they're assuming ceasing operations in June there's a period of time where they have to stop accepting new people.,153,,
1213,0.97,8366.658,8375.1,As of by June they're not sending people out on the street.,153,,
1214,0.97,8375.1,8381.573,They anticipate they will have found alternatives for those people by the time they have to cease operations.,153,,
1215,0.97,8381.573,8388.947,So as I understand it that means that they cannot take any more people after January of 2022.,153,,
1216,0.97,8388.947,8393.451,If they're going to create that scenario.,153,,
1217,0.97,8393.451,8406.464,That is a best case scenario with no additional funding.,153,,
1218,0.97,8406.464,8410.802,They're not sending people back out on the streets.,153,,
1219,0.97,8410.802,8413.238,Alternatives for folks in the just care facilities.,153,,
1220,0.97,8413.238,8443.001,I think it's important for setting public expectations about the efficacy of just care to help us address unsheltered homelessness to just recognize that they are not going to be able to accept new clients into their facilities after January of 2022 unless we are able to find some additional funding.,153,,
1221,0.97,8443.001,8443.301,Thank you.,153,,
1222,0.97,8443.301,8448.139,Thank you very much Council member Herbold.,154,,
1223,0.97,8448.139,8448.64,Council member Lewis.,154,,
1224,0.97,8448.64,8461.653,All the comments you made about just care and the work they do to provide services to especially high needs community members who are helping to shelter those individuals in appropriate Noncongregate shelter for example in hotels.,154,,
1225,0.97,8461.653,8466.891,All of that is exactly what we need to be doing right now.,154,,
1226,0.97,8466.891,8470.461,I too am concerned about what happens if they don't receive additional funding after June.,154,,
1227,0.97,8470.461,8479.337,I look forward to working with all of you as we hear more about what the true Underspent is in 2021.,154,,
1228,0.97,8479.337,8480.672,We'll know that early in 2022.,154,,
1229,0.97,8480.672,8488.947,"I look forward to working with you to make sure those high needs patients--excuse me, high needs individuals--apologies.",154,,
1230,0.97,8488.947,8492.35,As you know I worked in Healthcare in the past.,154,,
1231,0.97,8492.35,8499.123,That those high needs individuals don't face a situation where they are given a tent and shown the door.,154,,
1232,0.97,8499.123,8504.229,We need to be maintaining beds in this moment and I look forward to working with you all to do that.,154,,
1233,0.97,8504.229,8522.547,"I also am excited about this partnership with King County and in line with what the regional homelessness authority originally proposed to make sure that folks who are facing high Acuity needs, the highest Acuity needs have a safe place to go.",154,,
1234,0.97,8522.547,8535.593,Much more work to do to stand up those facilities and I want to also note the amendment that Council member Sawant had suggested to create new and to operate new safe parking lots.,154,,
1235,0.97,8535.593,8551.876,We have included that as well and we'll be looking forward to working with King County and the regional homelessness authority to make sure those living in vehicles have safe places to go and that is being done in conjunction with our County and regional partners as well.,154,,

1365,0.97,9449.64,9463.554,This was originally and ask for some funding but this could get additional information before the Council understands the full scope of that work.,168,,
1366,0.97,9463.554,9484.241,Sdci 1 B 1 would add position authority to not SDC review locations to review permit and inspection times at Sdci and request a report asking the executive to come back with a proposal that would allow that position to be supported through the fees.,168,,

1375,0.97,9525.983,9528.952,This is why we began the conversation last year.,169,,
1376,0.97,9528.952,9538.662,"Excuse me, earlier this year about the change to the single family misnomer and have moved forward with name change to create neighborhood residential.",169,,
1377,0.97,9538.662,9545.369,We need to have a Foundational understanding of what our current zoning situation is.,169,,
1378,0.97,9545.369,9551.008,So that we can talk about improvements to that and modifications in 2022.,169,,
1379,0.97,9551.008,9556.046,That requires us to get ideas directly from community many partners.,169,,
1380,0.97,9556.046,9557.447,And that requires resources.,169,,
1381,0.97,9557.447,9566.323,"So we as a Council are Prioritizing investments in it community conversations, building on the racial equity tool kit that we received earlier this year.",169,,
1382,0.97,9566.323,9577.234,So that any changes that we are proposing in 2023 for final passage in 2024 are rooted in those community conversations.,169,,
1383,0.97,9577.234,9581.405,That cannot happen in an authentic way unless there is resources.,169,,
1384,0.97,9581.405,9584.775,So that's what we have built back into this budget.,169,,
1385,0.97,9584.775,9586.076,That matters to our Council.,169,,
1386,0.97,9586.076,9593.35,Any additional comments people would like to highlight?,169,,

1390,0.97,9610.067,9627.884,I would just note that in the issue identification overview paper my colleague Yolanda provided an attachment that outlines all of the ways that that $14.3 million is allocated in the proposed budget.,170,,

1440,0.97,9946.102,9963.453,So first very appreciative of the addition of two really critical community projects in district 7 that there's been a lot of community organizing around and I'm sure they'll be greatly appreciated by the Belltown community to have a funded activation plan for the portal site.,176,,
1441,0.97,9963.453,9972.629,As well as be appreciated by the South Lake Union community to have the market to Mohi funding restored.,176,,

1445,0.97,9990.013,9993.483,"Council member Lewis, that is in this category.",177,,
1446,0.97,9993.483,9994.918,It is towards the bottom.,177,,

1451,0.97,10005.662,10029.152,"Greatly appreciate that and I do just want to briefly recognize that I'm very, very pleased to see that investment as a Noncar owning, bike, transit and pedestrian person myself where those are my primary means of transportation this is a really critical investment in public safety.",178,,
1452,0.97,10029.152,10032.822,I think sometimes we define public safety very narrowly.,178,,
1453,0.97,10032.822,10046.002,This investment really is going to be a Council commitment that's going to save lives and really structurally change the environment of the city to make us safer.,178,,

1457,0.97,10068.858,10073.73,Thank you very much Council member Lewis.,179,,

1459,0.97,10080.937,10081.237,Sorry.,180,,
1460,0.97,10081.237,10082.906,I might have accidentally risen my hand.,180,,
1461,0.97,10082.906,10093.85,I will just say thank you to all of the colleagues for acknowledging our need to invest in pedestrian infrastructure by putting in requests for your districts.,180,,
1462,0.97,10093.85,10111.468,Hopefully we will get to a place where across the city all of our constituents are safer walking and Biking and rolling.,180,,
1463,0.97,10111.468,10112.001,Thank you.,181,,
1464,0.97,10112.001,10129.052,I really appreciate the leadership of Council member Lewis in bringing this item forward and thank you as well for including this increase in the Cpt in the proposed budget.,181,,
1465,0.97,10129.052,10134.791,Looks like as promised Council member Lewis may have left.,181,,
1466,0.97,10134.791,10151.908,Did want to signal to him my interest in discussing with him potential beneficiaries of this parking tax might be.,181,,
1467,0.97,10151.908,10157.547,I know the recommendation does include some vision zero projects.,181,,
1468,0.97,10157.547,10166.623,I'm interested in an additional vision zero project and that is specifically the sidewalk safety repair.,181,,
1469,0.97,10166.623,10181.237,Just a little bit of background in 2019 Council passed resolution 31908 requesting policy options for sidewalk maintenance.,181,,
1470,0.97,10181.237,10188.077,Last year Sdot completed a report including policy recommendations for sidewalk repair in Seattle.,181,,
1471,0.97,10188.077,10205.762,One of those recommendations is that it was a city wide five year sidewalk shim Bevel plan to mitigate existing sidewalk Uplifts and other deficiencies that can create accessibility barriers or Trip/Fall risks.,181,,
1472,0.97,10205.762,10247.77,"And sort of following up on Sdot's work, council member Lewis had requested that the city auditor look into this area and just a couple weeks ago on August 29th the city auditor released a report entitled Seattle's sidewalk maintenance and repair program and one of the recommendations of the city auditor was that the city should in fact implement the recommendation from the June 2020 policy recommendations for sidewalk repairs in Seattle report, including increased investment in the sidewalk shim Bevel plan.",181,,
1473,0.97,10247.77,10267.924,So I'm interested to know whether or not there might be a willingness to Tweak the commercial parking tax proposal for another quarter of a percent in order to address some of these additional needs.,181,,
1474,0.97,10267.924,10272.128,I will discuss that with sponsor Offline.,181,,
1475,0.97,10272.128,10277.233,Just wanted to make that be known as well for the viewing public.,181,,
1476,0.97,10277.233,10280.536,Thanks for the transparency on that.,182,,
1477,0.97,10280.536,10281.07,Council member Pedersen.,182,,
1478,0.97,10281.07,10285.775,I cannot move on without us talking about bridges.,182,,
1479,0.97,10285.775,10295.918,I wanted to give you a chance to talk about the components listed in this draft proposed budget.,182,,
1480,0.97,10295.918,10296.753,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",183,,
1481,0.97,10296.753,10306.696,Wanted to thank the five Council members that had signed on to this in public previously.,183,,
1482,0.97,10306.696,10323.646,But really want to thank our budget chair for including this and for the flexibility and creativity to identify the sources and then to--so that this city council is not kicking the can down the road any more on bridges.,183,,
1483,0.97,10323.646,10335.758,We are providing authorization to the next administration to issue up to 100 million in bonds to support bridge safety.,183,,
1484,0.97,10335.758,10343.599,"Ideally Multimodal bridges and want to really thank the chair for, and central staff for their work on this to make this happen.",183,,
1485,0.97,10343.599,10348.204,I'll just be brief since I know we've talked about bridge as lot before.,183,,
1486,0.97,10348.204,10348.604,Thank you.,184,,
1487,0.97,10348.604,10350.606,I see Calvin on the line.,184,,
1488,0.97,10350.606,10356.479,I want to thank Calvin from central staff.,184,,

1491,0.97,10357.547,10364.02,You and your office for continuing to Brainstorm with us as we came up with creative solutions here.,184,,
1492,0.97,10364.02,10369.659,I want to note for members of the public that this is a Multifaceted CBA.,184,,
1493,0.97,10369.659,10371.627,This has multiple components to it.,184,,
1494,0.97,10371.627,10375.631,One is giving the authorization for the bond.,184,,
1495,0.97,10375.631,10380.236,The second is securing the $3.1 million as a temporary hold with a request for report back.,184,,
1496,0.97,10380.236,10391.547,In March of next year to give us a better sense of which projects would potentially be eligible for some level of bonding.,184,,
1497,0.97,10391.547,10401.657,"Importantly, we've added $1.1 million to Sdot to begin the work of creating a project design list that is at 30% and beyond so we can put people to work immediately.",184,,
1498,0.97,10401.657,10404.327,If there are to be bond dollars available.,184,,
1499,0.97,10404.327,10410.867,We're also very excited about the infrastructure proposal that's coming from Congress here very soon.,184,,
1500,0.97,10410.867,10420.042,Noting that there's still a lot of information that needs to be worked out in terms of how much comes directly to Seattle.,184,,
1501,0.97,10420.042,10431.988,"But the need is urgent and with the ability to bring more projects up to 30% plus design, I'm excited about being able to deploy Federal dollars and hopefully a transportation package in it year.",184,,
1502,0.97,10431.988,10436.325,Coupled with the ability that Council member Pedersen has made possible with the bonding authority here.,184,,
1503,0.97,10436.325,10447.069,I think we'll be able to bring more of our projects into a safe place so that bridges are not crumbling.,184,,
1504,0.97,10447.069,10455.044,So our roads are connected and we're considering the passage of vehicles as well as pedestrians and cyclists.,184,,
1505,0.97,10455.044,10470.226,I am also very thankful to Sdot for working with us to flag there was the possibility of using up to $5 million in their current reserve for immediate investments that also help put people to work on Retro fits and maintenance.,184,,
1506,0.97,10470.226,10475.598,Making sure we're looking at seismic Retro fits.,184,,
1507,0.97,10475.598,10479.902,Helps to connect our city in a more safe way.,184,,

1517,0.97,10583.506,10591.314,The first Subcategory is items related to the criminal legal system and alternatives to traditional public safety.,185,,
1518,0.97,10591.314,10600.489,This includes $7.4 million of spending and frees up $10.8 million of resources that you all spent a fair amount of time discussing earlier in today's committee meeting.,185,,
1519,0.97,10600.489,10603.659,I won't focus on those items.,185,,
1520,0.97,10603.659,10605.795,I'll just highlight a few.,185,,
1521,0.97,10605.795,10624.447,"One is Cscc 1 B 1 sponsored by Council member Herbold that adds $879,000 and 26 positions to the community safety and communications center to address the existing dispatch operational needs.",185,,

1540,0.97,10782.138,10782.505,Absolutely.,187,,
1541,0.97,10782.505,10782.805,Thank you.,187,,
1542,0.97,10782.805,10795.751,I first just want to talk a little bit about the proposal for the community safety and communications center.,187,,
1543,0.97,10795.751,10822.111,I think there's been a lot of focus on the conversation coming from it the Mayor's proposed executive order around bonuses and not sufficient attention paid to the ways that Council is working really hard in this budget process to try to address the unacceptable vacancies right now.,187,,
1544,0.97,10822.111,10836.759,So just wanting to recognize that the intent is to increase Ftes at Cscc by an additional 26 positions.,187,,
1545,0.97,10836.759,10848.07,This budget action relies on part from findings from a July 2016 Seattle police Department staffing analysis.,187,,
1546,0.97,10848.07,10848.671,Sometimes referred to.,187,,
1547,0.97,10848.671,10862.585,It informed Council's addition of 15 Ftes to the then SPD hosted 911 call center in the 2017 adopted budget.,187,,
1548,0.97,10862.585,10870.025,In the background Council added six Ftes to the nine proposed in the 2017 proposed budget.,187,,
1549,0.97,10870.025,10877.132,This is Council adding more Ftes to the 911 call center than was proposed.,187,,
1550,0.97,10877.132,10882.204,We didn't go as far as the report recommended.,187,,
1551,0.97,10882.204,10890.679,It recommended that call center should have 169 Ftes based on its workload analysis.,187,,
1552,0.97,10890.679,10899.455,Proposed budget 2022 for the CSC if unchanged would only fund 140 positions.,187,,
1553,0.97,10899.455,10900.956,Of which 20 are vacant.,187,,
1554,0.97,10900.956,10910.966,And an additional 17 currently have part-time absences due to situations such as military and medical leave.,187,,
1555,0.97,10910.966,10922.077,We are looking at adding an additional 26 positions on top of 140 brings it to 166 positions.,187,,
1556,0.97,10922.077,10960.382,"So still not quite getting to what the report recommended but we're certainly getting closer with this recommendation and really appreciate all the hard work that folks at Cscc's call center do every day in the middle of a transition from SPD into this new communications, community safety and communications center and recognize that vacancies result in mandatory use of our time and that can be very difficult and add to burnout.",187,,
1557,0.97,10960.382,10971.427,So we are working to add positions so we can beef up staffing there as necessary.,187,,
1558,0.97,10971.427,10983.906,And the other item I wanted to ask about is actually a recommendation coming from Council President Gonzalez.,187,,
1559,0.97,10983.906,10993.315,"This is, that is included in the chair's proposed balance budget.",187,,
1560,0.97,10993.315,10999.321,This is Hsd 025 B 001.,187,,
1561,0.97,10999.321,11029.618,Just want to highlight that I received a request from the city auditor's office to see if there's a way they could collaborate with Madam President on this particular CBA on the background on this is earlier this year I asked the city auditor to produce a report based on 2015 audit recommendations that have not yet been implemented by the human services Department.,187,,
1562,0.97,11029.618,11041.063,These recommendations are intended to help inform Hsd's work to support Community-Based organizations that have recently received community safety awards.,187,,
1563,0.97,11041.063,11046.568,"The city auditor, Hsd and Aawardees are working together on that effort.",187,,
1564,0.97,11046.568,11075.597,"These recommendations are really focused on how funded organizations can modify their practices to reflect the recommendations in that 2015 audit and it's, those recommendations are all really laser focused on best practices to support organizations working in the area of violence, interruption and violence prevention.",187,,
1565,0.97,11075.597,11093.549,The city auditor reached tout say they were hoping that they could work with Madam President Gonzalez on ensuring that the work proposed by this report also build on existing knowledge.,187,,
1566,0.97,11093.549,11097.453,There's a new 2020 review of best practices for reducing violence.,187,,
1567,0.97,11097.453,11106.328,Then also working to make sure it's aligned to help inform the work and the evaluation of a community safety initiative.,187,,
1568,0.97,11106.328,11116.004,So just flagging that I would love the opportunity to incorporate this should the sponsor of this item support that.,187,,
1569,0.97,11116.004,11117.84,Thank you very much.,188,,
1570,0.97,11117.84,11125.247,Any additional comments on that or any related concepts?,188,,
1571,0.97,11125.247,11156.078,I wanted to take a moment to thank the sponsors of the investments as well and to lead the diversion program that we have been working with to create important first contacts with people to divert them out of criminal justice system and get them into necessary services and partnership with entities like reach.,188,,
1572,0.97,11156.078,11203.559,Thanks to the report that trying to keep that number higher than the 3 million was a little bits of a challenge.,188,,
1573,0.97,11203.559,11211.633,"I'm optimistic about the potential Underspend, especially early next year to have that conversation to scale that program even further.",188,,
1574,0.97,11211.633,11215.17,Council member Strauss.,188,,
1575,0.97,11215.17,11239.461,I just want to make sure if you had any comments you'd like to add.,188,,
1576,0.97,11255.043,11261.283,We need to investigate ways we can get crisis responders to the places that people need them faster.,189,,
1577,0.97,11261.283,11278.634,We heard at my town hall last night the importance of having these mobile teams rather than having brick and mortar store fronts to meet these people where they are rather than wondering why they are not coming to the brick and mortar store fronts.,189,,
1578,0.97,11278.634,11280.936,This is how we meet peoples needs.,189,,
1579,0.97,11280.936,11291.179,We meet them where they are and we need to have a larger investment in how we can address people in the middle of crisis.,189,,
1580,0.97,11291.179,11300.022,Just a large appreciation chair for including this in the package.,189,,
1581,0.97,11300.022,11302.991,Any additional comments or questions?,190,,
1582,0.97,11302.991,11314.503,This is what the biggest point of contention was apparently over the last 20 hours and I want to make sure we get a chance to emphasize the investments that were made.,190,,
1583,0.97,11314.503,11325.747,I want to make sure that central staff has a chance to correct me.,190,,
1584,0.97,11325.747,11329.718,There's a direct nexus that totals up to around $27 million.,190,,
1585,0.97,11329.718,11333.789,Is that an accurate figure.,190,,
1586,0.97,11333.789,11336.291,"Yeah, that is correct.",191,,
1587,0.97,11336.291,11341.897,You'll see that carrying through for a little more so you can see the header or maybe you can.,191,,
1588,0.97,11341.897,11342.264,I can't.,191,,
1589,0.97,11342.264,11357.512,The overall resource in this category we are just in the first Subcategories of the next category you'll see those investments for example in fire and behavioral health.,191,,
1590,0.97,11357.512,11367.923,And other Subcategories coming up.,191,,
1591,0.97,11367.923,11376.131,"Total spending, $27, 028,351.",192,,
1592,0.97,11376.131,11384.106,If there's any question about whether this Council is informing in public safety.,192,,
1593,0.97,11384.106,11386.074,"$27,028,351 invested in public safety.",192,,
1594,0.97,11386.074,11390.078,That is our spending aspect of this budget.,192,,
1595,0.97,11390.078,11396.651,As well as where we have tried to address where there was possible resources that were not going to be used in 2022.,192,,
1596,0.97,11396.651,11403.258,We discuss that at the very beginning.,192,,
1597,0.97,11403.258,11404.659,I'm not hearing anything else.,192,,
1598,0.97,11404.659,11405.227,Such an important topic.,192,,
1599,0.97,11405.227,11406.661,We're going to go ahead and move on.,192,,
1600,0.97,11406.661,11408.63,I want to thank all of you.,192,,
1601,0.97,11408.63,11415.37,The investments you have made here I think are absolutely helping to create greater stability and safety.,192,,
1602,0.97,11415.37,11419.574,Helping to address concerns that we're hearing from neighbors and small businesses.,192,,
1603,0.97,11419.574,11429.351,We are investing in making sure our full hiring plan is intact as proposed by the Mayor.,192,,
1604,0.97,11429.351,11441.163,Utilized for maybe nice to have technology but not imperative in the moment or deemed essential by the monitor we are able to make some of these critical investments.,192,,
1605,0.97,11441.163,11442.731,"Thank you very much, colleagues.",192,,
1606,0.97,11442.731,11447.803,I look forward to future conversations about this.,192,,
1607,0.97,11447.803,11448.17,Let's continue.,192,,
1608,0.97,11448.17,11451.506,Moving on to fire and behavioral health.,193,,
1609,0.97,11451.506,11463.718,This includes $6.1 million of spending and about a $.8 million amendment that frees up some resources to support the proposals.,193,,
1610,0.97,11463.718,11476.298,"This includes CBO 2 a 1 sponsored by Council member Pedersen that is requesting that the city budget office develop models, cost and Timelines for citywide 24/7 mental and behavioral health response.",193,,
1611,0.97,11476.298,11489.778,It includes the amendment that Council member Strauss just spoke to Hsd 53 B 1 that would add $2.5 million.,193,,
1612,0.97,11489.778,11500.522,As well as Sfd 1 a 2 sponsored by Council member Herboldfold that would add $1.5 million for 20 additional firefighter recruits.,193,,
1613,0.97,11500.522,11513.235,"In addition it also includes funding in Hsd 57 a 1 that adds $100,000 to the human services Department for new health clinic in the Lake City neighborhood.",193,,
1614,0.97,11513.235,11521.543,And this is also where you'll see the resolution that Council member Herbold referred to previously.,193,,
1615,0.97,11521.543,11532.854,That would request increased funding for mental and behavioral health services.,193,,
1616,0.97,11532.854,11537.759,Expect to see that on the referral calendar on Monday.,193,,
1617,0.97,11537.759,11539.528,I will pause there.,193,,
1618,0.97,11539.528,11539.895,Wonderful.,194,,
1619,0.97,11539.895,11540.428,Council member Herbold.,194,,
1620,0.97,11540.428,11553.174,Did you want to add anything to any of these items.,194,,
1621,0.97,11553.174,11556.211,Just browsing through here.,195,,
1622,0.97,11556.211,11558.947,I think Aly covered it pretty well.,195,,
1623,0.97,11558.947,11577.232,Council member Strauss spoke to the behavioral health piece and we did talk a little bit about the high Acuity resolution about the partnerships with King County.,195,,
1624,0.97,11577.232,11603.992,So not seeing any further items to add other than my appreciation to the chair for allowing the Council to focus so much of its time and energy on mental and behavioral health needs for our community and that is reflected in this area of spending as well.,195,,
1625,0.97,11603.992,11642.764,"Appreciate having the time and space to work on what is now what I've discussed before as a single budget action which is now two separate budget actions, one to del to expand mental health services provided in schools and the other one through Hsd to expand funding that we make via our Interlocal agreement with King County for behavioral health services for the community through funding community Healthcare clinics.",195,,
1626,0.97,11642.764,11655.777,"Really appreciate all of these, really critical investments as we work to recover in the shadow of the pandemic.",195,,
1627,0.97,11655.777,11682.937,"Whether or not you're talking about recovering your physical health, recovering economically or recovering as it relates to your emotional health, all of these things are really important, I'm really proud that our city is so focused on addressing them.",195,,
1628,0.97,11682.937,11696.918,"I want to thank Council members Juarez, council member Morales, council member Pedersen who are alone listed on this document here and also the cosponsors of these various amendments for the work you have done.",195,,
1629,0.97,11696.918,11712.867,"This slide with the previous two slides because it was two full pages of public safety investments are really illuminate the Council's proposed budget here and our investments in health, community health, public health and public safety.",195,,
1630,0.97,11712.867,11724.512,Souples do take note of these investments here and the bays in which we'll help make sure that we're connecting folks to the right person when they have a moment of crisis and that we're then getting them connected to the right services.,195,,
1631,0.97,11724.512,11727.449,That's the big thing we need to continue to work on.,195,,
1632,0.97,11727.449,11730.385,Where people go after they have that initial touch.,195,,
1633,0.97,11730.385,11787.142,"We are working very hard to make sure if they do not need a response that requires a badge and a gun that they do have alternatives to show up many of the investments you see here, behavioral health and our investments in firefighters an our investments in mental health providers and I I mentioned when Wardening to assist in addressing some of the vacancy issues that they have.",195,,
1634,0.97,11787.142,11802.223,There's also a budget action where we're adding 1.5 million to support the training of the additional 20 firefighter recruits in 2022 to address a higher than average vacancy rate.,195,,
1635,0.97,11802.223,11812.4,As background from 2015 to 2019 afternoon average of 53 firefighters separated from the fire Department mostly due to retirement.,195,,
1636,0.97,11812.4,11824.045,In 202070 firefighters separated from Sfd and there have been over 70 separations to date in 2021 with more anticipated through the end of the year.,195,,
1637,0.97,11824.045,11833.888,Because the fire Department has a minimum daily staffing requirement any absences of scheduled uniform staff have to be filled by other staff who are working on an overtime basis.,195,,
1638,0.97,11833.888,11847.202,"With this additional funding that we're providing here in this budget, the fire Department is able to expand the size of each of two planned recruit classes from 30 to 40.",195,,
1639,0.97,11847.202,11853.274,The historical graduation rate from recruit school is approximately 75%.,195,,
1640,0.97,11853.274,11861.816,If 2022 results are consistent with past results the fire Department will be able to add approximately 60 new firefighters in 2022.,195,,
1641,0.97,11861.816,11866.321,30 each in the middle and near the end of the year.,195,,
1642,0.97,11866.321,11905.26,"Reason we're able to do this with fire Department and we can't do it as it relates to the police Department, you know, putting aside differences of opinion about how many officers the police Department should have, it's a different situation for the fire Department because they don't have the same artificial restraints associated request recruitment and training that the police Department has.",195,,
1643,0.97,11905.26,11913.134,The police Department has some restraints that the fire Department doesn't.,195,,
1644,0.97,11913.134,11924.078,So we can actually add funding for more positions than the fire Department plans to hire for in a way we cannot do with the police Department even if we wanted to.,195,,
1645,0.97,11924.078,11939.794,So really happy that we can do so with the Seattle fire Department and part of it is because so many people want to work for this superior organization in our city.,195,,
1646,0.97,11939.794,11974.896,Glad we can really focus some of our public safety efforts in this area which is a long standing Overseveral years there have been deficiencies as it relates to the total number of funded positions at the fire Department and just really appreciative of Madam chair and her partnership with me and trying to address these as I've been public safety chair.,195,,
1647,0.97,11974.896,11975.196,Thank you.,195,,
1648,0.97,11975.196,11979.1,Appreciate the work you're doing and continuing to call attention to.,196,,
1649,0.97,11979.1,11993.147,"All of the other departments especially in fire in other areas, this pandemic has definitely taken its toll on workforce stability in a number of areas of our city and so thank you for the work you're doing here to support our firefighters.",196,,
1650,0.97,11993.147,11995.216,And the work they do on the front line.,196,,
1651,0.97,11995.216,12030.351,"Not only for fighting fires and caring for some of our most vulnerable but for the work that they've done especially in this pandemic and supporting other areas of the country with fighting forest fires, not an easy workload by far and it's no wonder there's burnout and that's why we really Prioritize investments in mental health as well for firefighters and constant attention being drawn to the other areas of our Department that need to have a focus on shoring up their staff personnel as well.",196,,
1652,0.97,12030.351,12030.985,Wonderful.,196,,
1653,0.97,12030.985,12033.087,Well I am not seeing any additional hands.,196,,
1654,0.97,12033.087,12037.392,"Aly, would you like to continue.",196,,
1655,0.97,12037.392,12038.259,"Yes, happy to.",197,,
1656,0.97,12038.259,12045.199,"I think we are on, we have just three categories left in this main healthy and safety communities category.",197,,
1657,0.97,12045.199,12049.203,The next one is investments in food security.,197,,
1658,0.97,12049.203,12051.973,This includes $5.8 million of spending.,197,,
1659,0.97,12051.973,12056.611,There are two items that are related here.,197,,
1660,0.97,12056.611,12059.747,Hsd 5 B 1 and Hsd 27.,197,,
1661,0.97,12059.747,12065.586,"Excuse me, Hsd 26 a 1 sponsored by Council member Herbold.",197,,
1662,0.97,12065.586,12074.529,Adds $5.1 million to the human services Department to sustain 2021 levels of food and nutrition level funding and proposes a proviso.,197,,
1663,0.97,12074.529,12102.523,The second action requests that Hsd reports on the availability of State and Federal funding for food programs so the combination of this action is meant to ensure that food programs are sustained at the same level through the first 6 to 9 months of the year and that the expectation is that other funds will be made available through state and Federal funding that typically support investments in this space to ensure those programs can continue.,197,,
1664,0.97,12102.523,12112.7,"There's also a proposal sponsored by Council member Sawant that would add $100,000 to the human services Department to expand a fresh produce program.",197,,
1665,0.97,12112.7,12113.301,Serving the central district.,197,,
1666,0.97,12113.301,12129.317,"As well as a proposal from Council member Strauss Hsd 8 a 1 that would add $175,000 to Hsd for hot meal programs serving.",197,,
1667,0.97,12129.317,12134.722,Is there anything you'd like to flag?,198,,
1668,0.97,12134.722,12140.895,Any additional investments you'd like to see highlighted here?,198,,
1669,0.97,12140.895,12147.368,We're doing our very best to address the multiple request for food security in this proposed package.,199,,
1670,0.97,12147.368,12152.707,We made sure where we could to extend services.,199,,
1671,0.97,12152.707,12160.781,There was an initial request to make sure we were Trueing up investments in food security generally through mid year this year.,199,,
