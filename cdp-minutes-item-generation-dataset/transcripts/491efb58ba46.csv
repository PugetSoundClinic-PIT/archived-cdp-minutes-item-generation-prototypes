178,0.97,1309.541,1322.988,So do the commissioners want to introduce themselves and maybe we can start with Gina and you can Popcorn one of your fellow commissioners until we finish introductions?,65,,
179,0.97,1322.988,1323.388,Sounds good.,66,,

201,0.97,1421.286,1426.057,Do you what about to dig into the presentation?,69,,
202,0.97,1426.057,1433.365,"I know it is really robust and meaty, I think the fact we are running ahead of time is an advantage for all of you.",69,,
203,0.97,1433.365,1439.971,"So bee, are you going to be running that presentation?",69,,
204,0.97,1439.971,1440.505,Yes.,70,,
205,0.97,1440.505,1441.84,I am pulling it up now.,70,,
206,0.97,1441.84,1453.418,Let's dig into the presentation and I know folks from Ir will join us and we can certainly give them an opportunity to share thoughts to round out the conversation.,71,,
207,0.97,1453.418,1457.289,So who wants to kick us off?,71,,
208,0.97,1457.289,1459.024,Is that you Gina or Shalande?,71,,
209,0.97,1459.024,1469.167,I will get us started and then we will turn it over to the next commissioners.,72,,
210,0.97,1469.167,1469.501,Perfect.,73,,
211,0.97,1469.501,1469.768,Yes.,74,,
212,0.97,1469.768,1472.771,So this is the thank you and thank you for having us here.,74,,
213,0.97,1472.771,1479.244,We are excite to talk to but this.,74,,
214,0.97,1479.244,1480.712,It is interesting year.,74,,
215,0.97,1480.712,1482.714,Year-And-A-Half with the Commission and our communities.,74,,
216,0.97,1482.714,1490.021,I am very happy to be in front of you today.,74,,
217,0.97,1490.021,1493.024,We are--obviously we have--we could present a lot.,74,,
218,0.97,1493.024,1497.362,We could give you lots and lots of details.,74,,
219,0.97,1497.362,1499.164,Lots and lots of information.,74,,
220,0.97,1499.164,1510.342,We know that you are all up on the Statistics and the data and the efforts of the city.,74,,
221,0.97,1510.342,1537.135,We will give you slice of what we are hearing from the community and what we think should be Prioritized as we move forward in the next I don't know one to five years and some are longer term goals and just so we have a normal process to get us to a more equitable place than we were Precovid.,74,,
222,0.97,1537.135,1558.723,There is three things that we need for our communities but there is a 4TH piece that we want to highlight as the sort of effective overall scene that would make the other processes possible and that is effective language access.,74,,
223,0.97,1558.723,1571.403,"I think that if we don't have that one Foundational piece in our work, then none of the other measures, policies, et cetera, will have the impact that they need to have.",74,,
224,0.97,1571.403,1588.753,So I think that is sort of like the grounding that we want to set right now effective language access and I'm sure you know what that means but if you want us to go into more definition we can do that at the end.,74,,
225,0.97,1588.753,1606.404,The three things that we are asking for is learning from the successes of the vaccination Rollout this year and finding ways to Institutionalize that.,74,,
226,0.97,1606.404,1613.378,The second is to support small businesses through education and assistance and navigating the system.,74,,
227,0.97,1613.378,1620.952,And the final one is to increase opportunities and decrease barriers for our communities.,74,,
228,0.97,1620.952,1629.794,Within each of these we will have more detail in these points and we have a few testimonials from our community that we will read to you.,74,,
229,0.97,1629.794,1638.903,"Bee, can you go to the next slide, please?",74,,
230,0.97,1638.903,1660.125,"So we want to first and foremost recognize that the city has had with education and information, with the Quarantining and all of the measures and the vaccination process and how the city has focused on communities.",74,,
231,0.97,1660.125,1676.141,The piece I want to highlight there is that we know that focusing on communities work and it works by working with community based organizations and having good language access.,74,,
232,0.97,1676.141,1686.284,"How can we make these efforts, these efforts sort of Foundational for other policies and measures as we move forward?",74,,
233,0.97,1686.284,1697.562,One of the things in learning about what works this time and I don't know if this data can in the process.,74,,
234,0.97,1697.562,1698.596,I have seen the data.,74,,
235,0.97,1698.596,1734.165,We have seen the data on how many of the Bypock populations have been Vaccinated and I am wondering if there is a way to recognize this data and what the immigrant and refugee populations are doing especially those Undocumented and English--our English learners and or do not have access to health care.,74,,
236,0.97,1734.165,1751.683,I think that de segregated data will get us more information on how we can address health and equality at a larger scale so that when the next pandemic or vaccine comes out we know how to roll forward.,74,,
237,0.97,1751.683,1755.019,"Fun effective language and access, we know that is important.",74,,
238,0.97,1755.019,1783.281,"And the one thing that I keep thinking about working with these sort of like big systems is that if the--if this process is in somebody's--these great city workers that have made this happens, it is in their heads and laptops if they leave this job, do we reinvent the wheel next time?",74,,
239,0.97,1783.281,1791.389,There needs to be a way we can document and learn from this process for the next round.,74,,
240,0.97,1791.389,1805.069,"Bee, can you forward the slide, please?",74,,
241,0.97,1805.069,1809.374,This is a testimonial translated.,75,,
242,0.97,1809.374,1816.281,This is her translation of the Spanish testimonial.,75,,
243,0.97,1816.281,1818.783,A long testimonial and we have cut it short.,75,,
244,0.97,1818.783,1819.784,I will read it Outloud.,75,,
245,0.97,1819.784,1827.859,In a matter of days we had to learn how to impart preschool and Prekindergarten classes in a virtual format.,75,,
246,0.97,1827.859,1834.766,It was difficult for many adults and now imagine the same for small children.,75,,
247,0.97,1834.766,1841.973,The majority of the families decided to support us and give us a try to Online classes for their children.,75,,
248,0.97,1841.973,1851.316,Some others after seeing things were not improving decided to cancel the participation which made an impact on my payroll budget.,75,,
249,0.97,1851.316,1855.019,A lot of confusion from the government on how they could support us.,75,,
250,0.97,1855.019,1865.964,"The only quality that we had was when they demanded that our child care needed to remain opened as we were considered quote, Unquote essentially workers.",75,,
251,0.97,1865.964,1874.539,To be honest I feel that even my work was essential.,75,,
252,0.97,1874.539,1885.717,I don't know if you gleaned from this quote but she.,75,,
253,0.97,1885.717,1890.688,"[no Audio] bee, can you move forward one, please?",75,,
254,0.97,1890.688,1895.96,And I will turn it over to my colleague Shalandelandi.,75,,
255,0.97,1895.96,1896.261,Thanks.,76,,
256,0.97,1896.261,1907.505,My part of this is on small businesses and education and funding for small businesses and navigating those systems.,76,,
257,0.97,1907.505,1918.483,We wanted to just once again recognize the success that Seattle has with the Covid immigrant Fund and the small business stabilization fund.,76,,
258,0.97,1918.483,1938.102,Both of those things have helped our communities immensely and we have heard that back from our communities the rental support through United way has also been crucial in this time and once again our ongoing theme is language access.,76,,
259,0.97,1938.102,1956.888,"And having the language access to have these opportunities to know what is coming, to know what is out there is critical and making sure that immigrant and refugee communities have the right support that they need to go through these kind of big life things.",76,,
260,0.97,1956.888,1966.03,In the future what we want to see is more Digital access and financial literacy support.,76,,
261,0.97,1966.03,1972.77,What we were thinking would be great is like having how we did the Pop-Up vaccination clinics.,76,,
262,0.97,1972.77,1980.611,Something like that in terms of having a Pop-Up event for you know let's apply for Ppp.,76,,
263,0.97,1980.611,1982.513,How does that work?,76,,
264,0.97,1982.513,2000.164,Have like a question and answer and in person and having that available for our immigrant and refugee communities will be really helpful in navigating these different things that sometimes is a lot of confusion and questions about.,76,,
265,0.97,2000.164,2008.84,And part of that having that assistance available in different languages will be super helpful.,76,,
266,0.97,2008.84,2015.78,We also heard multiple base application processes is something that a lot immigrant refugee communities want.,76,,
267,0.97,2015.78,2020.952,"If they do not have access to a library for example, there is no home computer.",76,,
268,0.97,2020.952,2023.821,There is--everyone has a cell phone.,76,,
269,0.97,2023.821,2031.829,That they are using and it is much easier for folks to pull up an application and apply for something on their phone.,76,,
270,0.97,2031.829,2044.742,And so we wanted to mention that is something that we think is important as we think about how to better provide access in the future.,76,,
271,0.97,2044.742,2050.047,Back to the in person application opportunities.,76,,
272,0.97,2050.047,2067.665,Along with those Pop-Up clinics we thought something like that would have a greater chance for immigrant refugees to go if the question is answered and their application filled out and get in person support for whatever issue or question that they have.,76,,
273,0.97,2067.665,2072.67,"Bee, could you please go to the next slide?",77,,
274,0.97,2072.67,2073.237,This is a testimonial?,78,,
275,0.97,2073.237,2077.175,Th we received from someone that would like to remain anonymous.,78,,
276,0.97,2077.175,2080.478,I want to read it out as they wrote it.,78,,
277,0.97,2080.478,2086.651,My father is an immigrant Self- employed truck driver and I heard a lot about the payment protection program.,78,,
278,0.97,2086.651,2093.491,He reached out to me to ask for guidance and assistance.,78,,
279,0.97,2093.491,2104.068,Even with the Masters in public administration I found myself unsure what to recommend especially around it being what parts of it could be on Forgivable.,78,,
280,0.97,2104.068,2111.776,My father was able to connect with a financial adviser that knew more and gave sound information.,78,,
281,0.97,2111.776,2120.785,But I can imagine how challenging and navigating this great program can be for other immigrants and refugees.,78,,
282,0.97,2120.785,2124.055,"Bee, could you please go to the next slide?",78,,
283,0.97,2124.055,2132.13,I'm going to turn it back over to Gina.,78,,
284,0.97,2132.13,2132.43,Sorry.,79,,
285,0.97,2132.43,2133.097,I was muted.,79,,
286,0.97,2133.097,2137.935,You would think I would get used to this by now.,79,,
287,0.97,2137.935,2148.045,"Our third ask is that we increase opportunities and decrease barriers, to funding opportunities for our community.",79,,
288,0.97,2148.045,2154.986,"We know that--like we mentioned in terms of the funding that is out there, much appreciated.",79,,
289,0.97,2154.986,2162.093,But if someone is unable to reach those funds.,79,,
290,0.97,2162.093,2167.765,It doesn't matter to them that ex number of funds have been distributed and it didn't help them out in any way.,79,,
291,0.97,2167.765,2195.459,"In terms of what we have heard from communities and also just government offices, that the funding has been a drop in the bucket and I think especially for rental assistance, with the moratorium and issues like that coming up I think that families are worried and they are stressed out about what will be coming in the future.",79,,
292,0.97,2195.459,2200.264,Some more funding opportunities.,79,,
293,0.97,2200.264,2224.655,"Funding opportunities that have less restrictions on use and who can apply for them, again, Undocumented families and individuals easier application process and just direct cash rather than for example, rental support or food vouchers.",79,,
294,0.97,2224.655,2251.415,We know that a good number of our community members are choosing to pay rent and that food from the food banks or any other methods of feeding themselves or they may be going hungry because we fear homelessness or Houselessness in what might be coming in the future with that.,79,,
295,0.97,2251.415,2255.086,So that is a concern that a lot our community members have expressed.,79,,
296,0.97,2255.086,2266.497,The other piece that I wanted to highlight and this goes beyond just the economic recovery.,79,,
297,0.97,2266.497,2274.972,This is for me as a mother an important piece for education.,79,,
298,0.97,2274.972,2293.157,I think that we don't even know we are Underserved students are until we get them back in the classroom because I think there are a good number of students in our community that are not able to attend Online schooling for various reasons.,79,,
299,0.97,2293.157,2307.872,I live by the sky way library and there are kids with their eye pads or phones doing school outside to get Wi-Fi.,79,,
300,0.97,2307.872,2319.817,And I think that this access to the Internet is important issue to address when you are thinking about barriers.,79,,
301,0.97,2319.817,2320.017,Okay.,79,,
302,0.97,2320.017,2320.584,I am going to turn it.,79,,
303,0.97,2320.584,2325.79,"Bee, can you go to the next slide, please?",79,,
304,0.97,2325.79,2331.062,And I will turn it to Aroge.,79,,
305,0.97,2331.062,2335.299,Thank you.,80,,
306,0.97,2335.299,2339.704,I will give my testimony on how I ended up an immigrant.,80,,
307,0.97,2339.704,2342.239,My family and I were impacted by the current pandemic.,80,,
308,0.97,2342.239,2351.849,I will just read it off and kind of give more details.,80,,
309,0.97,2351.849,2365.029,So I wrote Undocumented immigrant through the pandemic was extremely challenging and learning how to navigate my education and through the global pandemic and no support from the Federal Government made my reality unbearable.,80,,
310,0.97,2365.029,2374.905,This past new year and diagnosed with the Covid virus and my family has more than terrified due to that status we have never been able to qualify for health insurance.,80,,
311,0.97,2374.905,2389.22,The pandemic made it extremely difficult for me to put my focus on my education as I was faced with a tremendous financial and social barriers.,80,,
312,0.97,2389.22,2389.453,Sorry.,80,,
313,0.97,2389.453,2394.558,I am a little emotional but Yeah.,80,,
314,0.97,2394.558,2399.33,I am currently at the University Washington student.,80,,
315,0.97,2399.33,2409.306,This pandemic has been hard as Undocumented student who is currently learning how to navigate different systems.,80,,
316,0.97,2409.306,2415.179,I didn't plan on getting emotional but it happens.,80,,
317,0.97,2415.179,2449.113,It has been challenging because Gina and Shalande have talk about the support has been challenging because it has been legal and financial barriers because we didn't qualify for funding from the government due to our status and unable to qualify for any kind of stimulus check or any kind of check from the government because of the lack of support from the Federal Government government and so we had to stress about rent.,80,,
318,0.97,2449.113,2535.232,We had to stress about--when we got diagnosed we were all diagnosed with Covid and Luckily we were able to get free testing and free support to Vaccinations and my dad got sick and fell extremely ill and we did not have health insurance and we took care of him at the house and it was difficult but I was able to get a lot of support from the refugee Commission that gave me a lot of aid and assistance on how to apply for aid and what made it easy was the presence of the availability of these--that me and my family can apply to it and it helped us so much and relief that we were able to qualify for a little bit of money because there was so much on our plate and we needed at the time and whether that was groceries or masks or just Sanitizers and little stuff like when my dad got sick he needed diabetes strips because he got diabetes through Covid and there were complications that we didn't have any additional support for.,80,,
319,0.97,2535.232,2561.559,And so it was hard and being able to be here and looking back at the mental health aspect is here and the stigma that is present and we are very much thankful for spaces like these that are very much reality and policy.,80,,
320,0.97,2561.559,2574.905,Even if it is being able to give my story out here it means a lot because I am definitely one of the Bypock communities that have been impacted by this.,80,,
321,0.97,2574.905,2578.108,I will just turn it over to Gina because I am getting emotional.,80,,
322,0.97,2578.108,2587.818,I would like to say thank you so much for the opportunity and thank you for hearing us out.,80,,
323,0.97,2587.818,2589.853,Thank you.,81,,
324,0.97,2589.853,2592.99,Can you go to the next page?,81,,
325,0.97,2592.99,2614.812,This is our last page and reiterating three things that we need for community and what we have learned from the vaccination roll out and the community help that the city has done.,81,,
326,0.97,2614.812,2618.849,Supporting small businesses through increased education.,81,,
327,0.97,2618.849,2629.36,And assistance in navigating the system and maybe replicating the vaccine Rollouts as a way to roll out the funding processes.,81,,
328,0.97,2629.36,2642.272,"One thing that we did notice with the city, when people could apply for funding it was gone within a matter of hours or days.",81,,
329,0.97,2642.272,2654.251,So if people were not hearing about the process or not able to navigate the system the funding was gone.,81,,
330,0.97,2654.251,2662.526,Increased opportunities which means increasing funding and decreasing barriers to the funding and how the funding can be used.,81,,
331,0.97,2662.526,2676.673,"And with that, if you have any questions, please feel free to, Yeah, we were here.",81,,
332,0.97,2676.673,2676.907,Great.,81,,

334,0.97,2698.829,2737.935,I know that is never easy and it is okay to be vulnerable in this space and in any space and just really want to thank you for being willing to share your own personal experience in family's experience with us because it does help us as policymakers understand why this work is important and to identify ways to condition constantly improve and that's our goal is to constantly improve so we are looking up those that need our help the most first and foremost and our policies and decisions that we are making about how to appropriate really important dollars.,81,,
335,0.97,2737.935,2745.576,So thanks for being with us here today.,81,,
336,0.97,2745.576,2751.782,"Colleagues, any comments or questions on the presentation?",81,,

339,0.97,2755.819,2760.157,Well done and thank you for sending us an updated presentation.,81,,
340,0.97,2760.157,2813.21,We will make sure to keep that presentation--the presentation part of the public record and part of our packets for the committee and as we continue to consider investments in the city I think it will be helpful to have that as a reference as we are thinking about making sure that we are identifying and Prioritizing populations and community with the city of Seattle who don't have access to a lot of other resources so now when we are talking our dollars and how we will utilize the Federal dollars they come with restrictions that impact our community members.,81,,
341,0.97,2813.21,2838.001,I am proud of the work we have been able to do as a refugee community and in terms of how we are addressing Covid and address equitable distribution of Vaccinations and proud of the work that we did at the state in Championing a massive historic investment especially for Undocumented immigrants is huge.,81,,
342,0.97,2838.001,2858.188,And obviously the need is great as we heard from the presentation but I think that victory that we had at the state level is directly attributable to all of the advocacy and great organizing happening within the immigrant refugee community.,81,,
343,0.97,2858.188,2862.726,Proud of all of those wins as well.,81,,
344,0.97,2862.726,2882.813,Much more work to do and thank you for being willing to be with us and share about the Commission's perspective and I see that Peggy is with us and if you would like to say anything I definitely want to give you the opportunity to do that before we shift gears to our final agenda item.,81,,

379,0.97,3096.626,3128.859,And this report is a Testament to the hard and intentional work of the deal team and the community members and partners and institutional partners like Seattle public schools and King County and the Seattle colleges that are part of this collective effort so I am super excited about this.,92,,
380,0.97,3128.859,3129.893,"Next slide, please.",92,,
381,0.97,3129.893,3142.572,Today I will provide an overview of the levy and it's goals and will share our executive summary and then Dr.,92,,

384,0.97,3182.012,3185.782,"Next slide, please.",92,,
385,0.97,3185.782,3185.982,Okay.,92,,
386,0.97,3185.982,3186.283,Thank you.,92,,
387,0.97,3186.283,3218.281,"Our Department strides to achieve what you see right here four results for Seattle children and youth and young adults and all families have access to high quality child care that Seattle children, are kindergarten ready and students graduate high school on time and ready for college or career and the students complete the path of their choice.",92,,
388,0.97,3218.281,3223.753,Those are the results.,92,,
389,0.97,3223.753,3225.055,"Next slide, please.",92,,
390,0.97,3225.055,3225.255,Okay.,92,,
391,0.97,3225.255,3230.06,Before we get to the numbers and results.,92,,
392,0.97,3230.06,3246.443,I want to go to the overall vision for the Sep levy to partner with families and community to achieve educational equities and close gaps and build a better economic future for Seattle students.,92,,
393,0.97,3246.443,3256.319,Wanted to ground us in that for a quick moment.,92,,
394,0.97,3256.319,3257.087,Thank you.,92,,
395,0.97,3257.087,3269.733,You can see our year Sep by the numbers and I want to draw your attention to is the amount of work by deal staff and the amount that Beal staff led.,92,,
396,0.97,3269.733,3273.203,10 competitive funding processes.,92,,
397,0.97,3273.203,3324.954,That's a lot and that included 40 community review panelists and deal has made the funding process more equitable and this was important for the first year of the levy and some things that we did to make it more equitable included youth and community members that served on the review panels for their time and provided anti bias training before there were applicants and allowed participants to provide an interview or presentation as part of the review process and moving away from the written world as the sole determinant for the application score.,92,,
398,0.97,3324.954,3355.418,And Normalizing the factors so there is a common experience across the processes and we are just so grateful to our Seattle voters for this opportunity to have these investments on behalf of our community and we know that numbers present a strong foundation for levy implementation.,92,,
399,0.97,3355.418,3357.42,"Next slide please, thank you.",92,,
400,0.97,3357.42,3370.8,Now what I want to do is ground us in the levy's implementation.,93,,
401,0.97,3370.8,3378.408,What you will hear today is the discussion of the first year results.,93,,
402,0.97,3378.408,3379.476,The bar right there.,93,,
403,0.97,3379.476,3382.812,We are in year two the pink bar.,93,,
404,0.97,3382.812,3411.941,In this year the levy oversight members and Council supported the use of the Sep funds for emergency child care program utilizing the investment areas in utilizing the Sep preschool and early learning investment area funds.,93,,
405,0.97,3411.941,3412.976,"Next slide, please.",93,,
406,0.97,3412.976,3432.128,"So ultimately school buildings closed in March of 2020 and the early child, emergency child care program for essential workers was deal's first Covid 19 adoption.",93,,
407,0.97,3432.128,3442.105,We invested two million for them child care from April through June and served 256 children from 196 families.,93,,
408,0.97,3442.105,3452.682,I wanted to really make sure that we highlighted that one.,93,,
409,0.97,3452.682,3453.516,"Next slide, please.",93,,
410,0.97,3453.516,3458.555,So Dr. Fahardo in a moment is going to be sharing some meaty data with you today.,93,,
411,0.97,3458.555,3470.3,But the top things that you can take away are literally here.,93,,
412,0.97,3470.3,3476.739,Seattle participants are more ready for school and racial gaps are gradually closing.,93,,
413,0.97,3476.739,3506.336,The second is high school graduation rates for partner schools increased compared to the previous years and the third one is that our Seattle promise Cohort of 2018 from fall to fall retention was higher than Seattle college students overall and two year completion rates are comparable to the last dollar promise program.,93,,
414,0.97,3506.336,3507.403,"Next slide, please.",93,,
415,0.97,3507.403,3507.704,Thank you.,93,,
416,0.97,3507.704,3517.247,So now what I want to do is I want to point out that spending you see here is for the 2020 calendar year.,93,,
417,0.97,3517.247,3520.817,Not strictly for the 2019 school year.,93,,
418,0.97,3520.817,3536.666,And if you have specific questions as always we are happy to have our Finance team follow up with central staff to make sure we are addressing them.,93,,
419,0.97,3536.666,3545.475,For 2020 this impacted our spending in early learning and K12.,93,,
420,0.97,3545.475,3548.678,Most of this occurred in preschool and early learning.,93,,
421,0.97,3548.678,3573.403,"9.8 million and some of the things that account for this are deal, Remodified our programming to include remote hybrid and remote and hybrid preschool instruction to ultimately meet the needs of the family and providers during the pandemic that paid out at a reduced rate.",93,,
422,0.97,3573.403,3620.083,Also Seattle public schools or Seattle public schools that is our largest Sep provider offered one hundred percent remote programming for 12 months that reduced costs and deal also saw reduced and comprehensive cost that is normally provided to SES students and the training was halted throughout the spring of 2020 and changed to a remote service model in the fall that actually resulted in more cost savings.,93,,
423,0.97,3620.083,3639.102,And additional 1 point 6 million occurred in K12 and this was driven by the remote learning context for the school based investments and the unearned based and performance pay from contracts.,93,,
424,0.97,3639.102,3648.144,So what you can see from this table that the year was 11.5 million.,93,,
425,0.97,3648.144,3672.235,"However, in June, we received notification that property tax for levy collections were 2.2 million less than anticipated so or should I say less than expected so the net Underspan is actually 9.3 million with this adjustment.",93,,
426,0.97,3672.235,3679.776,And what this said we looked for this for our Council on how to best reinvest the funds.,93,,
427,0.97,3679.776,3696.159,And so what I will do now is pass this over to Dr. Fahardo to lead us through progress results.,93,,
428,0.97,3696.159,3699.695,Thank you director s H Apel.,94,,
429,0.97,3699.695,3703.232,We will go towards the results an 2019-2020.,94,,
430,0.97,3703.232,3707.07,Again this is last year and what happened.,94,,
431,0.97,3707.07,3712.542,Dwayne covered some Covid impacts that occurred.,94,,
432,0.97,3712.542,3725.221,So I will keep that framing for the results.,94,,
433,0.97,3725.221,3744.54,Okay so with the Sep levy it required annual progress reports as part of the city's accountability taxpayers so that means we have some report can requirements and we need to share access to our services and progress in meeting our levy goals.,94,,
434,0.97,3744.54,3751.047,And report on demographic data when discussing our goals and our outcomes.,94,,
435,0.97,3751.047,3764.327,There were some additional requirements that were made in the implementation value plan and more information on the Seattle promise has been experienced.,94,,
436,0.97,3764.327,3767.196,Administrative decisions for modifications and also some Council priorities identified.,94,,
437,0.97,3767.196,3772.468,The last three bullets can be found in the data Appendix.,94,,
438,0.97,3772.468,3777.673,We won't cover those last two bullets today.,94,,
439,0.97,3777.673,3801.564,"As director Shapel mentioned there is data limitations to the data we will discuss but just keep in mind that we are using the best available data and as Dwayne talked about, there was data collection for early learning and K investments.",94,,
440,0.97,3801.564,3806.102,We tried to provide historical trend analysis to provide framing to existing base lines.,94,,
441,0.97,3806.102,3809.372,And we do that where it is appropriate.,94,,
442,0.97,3809.372,3823.653,Today's focus is mainly on student level outcomes and these are the outcomes that were decided with the plans.,94,,
443,0.97,3823.653,3826.489,The racial segregation.,94,,
444,0.97,3826.489,3828.09,Last time it was presented to Council.,94,,
445,0.97,3828.09,3833.029,Deal has multiple internal and data systems across our investment areas.,94,,
446,0.97,3833.029,3849.745,And that will collect the same level of data de segregation and acknowledge interest in the previous time that I presented about understanding about further de segregation and the Asian community.,94,,
447,0.97,3849.745,3866.929,Unfortunately we have not done that for this presentation because this was written a few months ago but we look forward ensuring that future presentations have that updated on de segregation.,94,,
448,0.97,3866.929,3873.603,So the implementation plan lays out deals for the levy investments.,95,,
449,0.97,3873.603,3888.517,In that plan we detail the evaluation values and the process and outcome evaluation on specific investments so what you see on the slide is we have three ways we monitor the investments.,95,,
450,0.97,3888.517,3896.626,"The green is, we track and report on keep progress on outcomes the main focus of today.",95,,
451,0.97,3896.626,3906.168,We also have process and outcome modifications that we conduct based on specific investments.,95,,
452,0.97,3906.168,3928.891,The other part is that I want to acknowledge in monitoring the performance management we use this data to ensure that we are looking at the data to ensure that we are making continuous quality improvement efforts and also for accountability to deal and to serve our partners.,95,,
453,0.97,3928.891,3935.231,For today I will walk you through how deal tracks the accountability framework.,95,,
454,0.97,3935.231,3942.104,For each investment area we will remind you the strategies and who we serve and how we measure our progress towards our goals.,95,,
455,0.97,3942.104,3943.506,Who has seen our services?,95,,
456,0.97,3943.506,3945.641,What is our progress towards our goal?,95,,
457,0.97,3945.641,3956.752,We do that from looking at data from year to year and take an equitable analysis on the headline indicator to ensure that we are closing the race base gaps.,95,,
458,0.97,3956.752,3966.862,So we are looking at the preschool and early learning investment.,95,,
459,0.97,3966.862,3987.45,"Here director Shapel says we want kindergarten preparedness and we have several strategies that we think will help us get there and you see that we have multiple programs, we have coaches and families that all play a role in ensure that we have good results.",95,,
460,0.97,3987.45,4002.832,We have headline indicators that is ensuring that our children are meeting the standards and so when they enter kindergarten and monitoring and making sure that opportunities in gaps are closed within the students.,95,,
461,0.97,4002.832,4016.445,And I won't cover too many supporting indicators but this is supporting indicators that we feel will help us get the result that we want with the kids' readiness.,95,,
462,0.97,4016.445,4020.282,So to start off the Seattle preschool program is providing access in the city.,95,,
463,0.97,4020.282,4023.686,We have 23 provider agencies.,95,,
464,0.97,4023.686,4027.656,We have 68 sites during the 2019-2020 year.,95,,
465,0.97,4027.656,4029.358,We served over 1800 children.,95,,
466,0.97,4029.358,4046.208,"The map on the left-hand side is broken up by Council districts where the Orange Dotings are the sites, the 68 sites and the blue is the darker the blue the more children that we served during 20 19-2020.",95,,
467,0.97,4046.208,4058.054,You can see we have the most children being served and Council district two.,95,,
468,0.97,4058.054,4074.57,So within our children Seattle preschool program served about 77% of by Pock children and we had I equal distribution between female and male children.,95,,
469,0.97,4074.57,4094.023,We served a large percentage of low-income children and families and we had a 37% were identified as refugee or immigrant families that are Accessing our program.,95,,
470,0.97,4094.023,4097.326,When Dwayne mentioned that I had meaty data this is what Dwayne was talking about.,95,,
471,0.97,4097.326,4104.767,There is a lot to impact here but when you look at this table on the left-hand column you have the years.,95,,
472,0.97,4104.767,4106.635,We are tracking historical trends.,95,,
473,0.97,4106.635,4113.909,We have data that dates back to our first Ftp when it was implemented in 2015-2016.,95,,
474,0.97,4113.909,4119.081,We are tracking how many children did we serve.,95,,
475,0.97,4119.081,4136.665,We are also tracking our--making sure that preschool teachers are meeting goals and their development during the preschool and the headline indicator is basically what happens to the students when they enroll in kindergarten.,95,,
476,0.97,4136.665,4141.437,Are they ready and we measure the standards assessment.,95,,
477,0.97,4141.437,4160.99,And finally you have the percentage of race based opportunity gaps making sure that we are closing these gaps and the way that we calculate it here we take the lowest race percentage that are meeting the standards and that is how we get the gap.,95,,
478,0.97,4160.99,4166.495,So obviously we want the gap to be closer to zero.,95,,
479,0.97,4166.495,4170.232,"But also ensuring that all kids, all children are meeting the standards.",95,,
480,0.97,4170.232,4177.039,A lot of data that we kind of want to walk through.,95,,
481,0.97,4177.039,4183.779,By the big take away is that Sep is serving children more and more every year.,95,,
482,0.97,4183.779,4191.053,We started in 2015 and 2016 with 247 children and in 2020 we served over 1800.,95,,
483,0.97,4191.053,4203.566,Within our supporting indicators we kind of see a small or little growth within this and that is mainly attribute to the Samuel size of the Cohort getting bigger.,95,,
484,0.97,4203.566,4211.207,I do want to highlight that in 2019-2020.,95,,
485,0.97,4211.207,4220.783,We did not collect data due to Covid and right now we are in the process of processing the Wa kid standard for 2019-2020.,95,,
486,0.97,4220.783,4244.573,So Unfortunately today we won't be able to cover much on the 2019-2020 but what we will do is take a deep dive within the 2018-2019 Cohort that Spired Sep and in 2020 those were Kindergarteners.,95,,
487,0.97,4244.573,4251.88,"Taking a deep dive on 2018- 2019, this is our equity analysis on the readiness gaps.",96,,
488,0.97,4251.88,4258.187,I am showing all of the data by race groups.,96,,
489,0.97,4258.187,4282.845,We are looking at the various groups and the seven race ethnic groups and we are looking to see how many kindergarten students were in that group in 2018-2019 there were four thousand children.,96,,
490,0.97,4282.845,4285.18,The parentheses is the sphere of influence.,96,,
491,0.97,4285.18,4293.288,And the next column we are looking how many SPs children were meeting kindergarten readiness.,96,,
492,0.97,4293.288,4306.201,And we see that the 67 were kindergarten could readiness and the SPs children how many were kindergarten ready 59 that gives us a percentage difference of negative eight for Sep.,96,,
493,0.97,4306.201,4318.814,When we take a closer look a how this plays out by race I will see there are highlights within the black and African- American children.,96,,
494,0.97,4318.814,4320.683,In general SPs is 49%.,96,,
495,0.97,4320.683,4332.027,That means Wa kids standards and if you participated in the program you were more likely to be prepared.,96,,
496,0.97,4332.027,4338.367,We had a 10% increase for black African-American children.,96,,
497,0.97,4338.367,4340.869,Moving us on.,96,,
498,0.97,4340.869,4350.946,We are in our K to 12 community based investments.,96,,
499,0.97,4350.946,4355.584,Just as a reminder Council President Gonzelez mentioned we had a transition year.,96,,
500,0.97,4355.584,4368.731,I do want to acknowledge we have school base investments but those schools were different in the transition year than they are for the year or two of the se P levy and we have strategies that happened.,96,,
501,0.97,4368.731,4376.972,"We had opportunity and access, wrap around services and Cull specific responsive.",96,,
502,0.97,4376.972,4388.784,Here they are investment area and the headline indicator for this investment is insuring that students graduate in four years.,96,,
503,0.97,4388.784,4400.062,We have supporting indicators whether students are meeting 8th grade proficiency and English language arts and math and we will cover that in the next few slides.,96,,
504,0.97,4400.062,4408.303,And here is that reminder that I talked about so I will keep us moving.,96,,
505,0.97,4408.303,4408.504,Okay.,96,,
506,0.97,4408.504,4412.908,So our services again are providing access in the whole entire city.,96,,
507,0.97,4412.908,4419.782,"We had 63 Grantees, school and community based organizations.",96,,
508,0.97,4419.782,4422.684,We had 41 school partners.,96,,
509,0.97,4422.684,4427.723,And during 2019-2020 we served over 2300 children and students.,96,,
510,0.97,4427.723,4429.625,The Orange dots are partners sides.,96,,
511,0.97,4429.625,4439.535,"41 and the darker the blue, the more students were being served in that district.",96,,
512,0.97,4439.535,4447.009,Again we have Council district two with students participating in the December to 12 resources.,96,,
513,0.97,4447.009,4452.014,Within our K to 12 services we had 66% of the students served.,96,,
514,0.97,4452.014,4468.263,Identified as by Pock and we had equal distribution between the Female-Male and we had good percentage of our students that were free and reduced lunch and participate in the program at 46% on the right-hand side.,96,,
515,0.97,4468.263,4481.276,"We also tracked immigrant and refugee families and whether they were Eol learners, special education and if they were experiencing homelessness.",96,,
516,0.97,4481.276,4485.814,"So keeping our eye on the result, we want students to graduate high school in four years.",96,,
517,0.97,4485.814,4497.493,So here very similar to the early learning slide we are looking at a historical trend by years.,96,,
518,0.97,4497.493,4521.416,"We are figuring out who did we serve in that year and we are we in the supporting indicators that let us know if we are on track which in this case is graduation so who did we serve in 2017-2018 we had 22,000 and we increased to over 2300.",96,,
519,0.97,4521.416,4527.923,As we noticed in the early learning Covid played an impact in our assessment data.,96,,
520,0.97,4527.923,4536.298,That means we don't have a common way to assess student learning and the 3RD 8th grade math.,96,,
521,0.97,4536.298,4555.851,But we did have a graduation data for this 2019 school year and one thing that I want to highly with each year will you see that graduation rates for levy funded high schools have improved every year and the Race-Base opportunity gaps appears to be closing.,96,,
522,0.97,4555.851,4568.997,So we are going to take a deep dive on 2019-2020 and take a look at the 85% graduation and the 24% of the racial gap.,96,,
523,0.97,4568.997,4569.197,Okay.,96,,
524,0.97,4569.197,4574.736,So we are looking at the class of 2020.,96,,
525,0.97,4574.736,4589.651,Again this class had an 86% graduation level for all SPs graduates and looking at only funded schools we--it was 85 so percentage difference of minus one.,96,,
526,0.97,4589.651,4607.703,But keeping in mind that levy funded schools were selected due to the academic needs.,96,,
527,0.97,4607.703,4617.813,There is move to grow between the black African-American children and we saw highlights in the Asian American children.,96,,
528,0.97,4617.813,4628.457,We will continue to monitor and excited with what we saw with our levy funded school results.,96,,
529,0.97,4628.457,4643.905,"Moving onto the K through 12 school health investment area, we had seven provider agencies that 28 sides that served over 9000 students.",96,,
530,0.97,4643.905,4647.309,"Same as the previous slides, the Orange or the school base health center sites.",96,,
531,0.97,4647.309,4661.323,The darker the blue the more students that attended that school in that Council district.,96,,
532,0.97,4661.323,4685.48,69% of students identified as by Pock Studentsand in this case we had more female students heal services and 10% percentage difference and 32% that identified as immigrant and refugee families.,96,,
533,0.97,4685.48,4691.42,So within our result that we are trying to achieve students are happy to learn.,96,,
534,0.97,4691.42,4711.373,We have three years of historical data with 2019-2020 being the year that Covid impacted our services on that spring of 2020 so you get to see sue we decreased the amount of students that were served.,96,,
535,0.97,4711.373,4731.226,Some of the supporting indicators are whether students are receiving screening and fully immunized and their difficulties and questionnaire they fill out that is geared towards social learning and to get a sense for their needs.,96,,
536,0.97,4731.226,4740.569,With that the number of Sdq went down but we did have TELE health play a role in the spring of 2020.,96,,
537,0.97,4740.569,4757.552,That is expected for who was served but it was good to see that the number of students receiving oral health screening stayed on par with the previous year and the same for students that are fully immunized.,96,,
538,0.97,4757.552,4766.194,The only thing I wanted to highlight were headline indicators that we are monitoring.,96,,
539,0.97,4766.194,4767.963,Attendance is one.,96,,
540,0.97,4767.963,4774.402,Every year there is an improvement and the same for those graduating four years.,96,,
541,0.97,4774.402,4788.884,Although there are some some differences and bigger gaps within the race of opportunity gaps for both attendance and graduation.,96,,
542,0.97,4788.884,4797.459,"Actually not Graduations but improving, attendance is staying up.",96,,
543,0.97,4797.459,4799.594,So shifting to the Seattle promise.,96,,
544,0.97,4799.594,4818.213,So here again we are looking at 2019-2020 and during this time we had both--we had 397 promise scholars enrolled that included Cohort second year.,96,,
545,0.97,4818.213,4823.251,We had six eligible high schools.,96,,
546,0.97,4823.251,4825.62,"Ingram and Cleveland, West Seattle and beach.",96,,
547,0.97,4825.62,4827.322,Most students were enrolled at South Seattle college.,96,,
548,0.97,4827.322,4834.329,And you can see that with the larger orange circle.,96,,
549,0.97,4834.329,4843.371,And most scholars are spread out in the city or at least from the six schools.,96,,
550,0.97,4843.371,4856.117,I will acknowledge next year we will share the data on our high school students and we will also be able to attract and report on the graduation and retention.,96,,
551,0.97,4856.117,4864.893,I am excited to share the 2020- 2021 report with Council.,96,,
552,0.97,4864.893,4869.03,And I'm going to let Dr. Shapel close it out.,96,,
553,0.97,4869.03,4870.699,Sure.,97,,
554,0.97,4870.699,4871.533,Great job.,97,,
555,0.97,4871.533,4876.438,Thank you Dr. Fahardo and wanted to say that we will be back next month.,97,,
556,0.97,4876.438,4879.04,As you can see we love coming to present.,97,,
557,0.97,4879.04,4884.98,"It will be our early learning director, our K12 and whole secondary directors.",97,,
558,0.97,4884.98,4898.393,They will be here as well and happy to take any questions that you have regarding data and the program monitoring questions.,97,,
559,0.97,4898.393,4900.795,Thank you.,98,,
560,0.97,4900.795,4903.031,Director Shapel and director Dr. Fahardo.,98,,
561,0.97,4903.031,4913.008,Is there any comments or questions about the presentation.,98,,
562,0.97,4913.008,4914.809,Really well done.,98,,
563,0.97,4914.809,4944.973,I think it is the gold standard in terms of how we make sure we are good stewards of taxpayer dollars and also how we are making sure that dollars are utilized to achieve concrete goals and appreciative of the important hard work that goes into making sure that we are getting these investments out quickly and flexible this last year.,98,,
564,0.97,4944.973,4953.515,I don't think any of us expected that our first year of this levy would be during a global pandemic.,98,,
565,0.97,4953.515,4964.993,It did test the Department and us as a city in terms of our ability to be mobile and true to the quality standards that we want to subscribe to.,98,,
566,0.97,4964.993,4968.363,So huge thanks to all of you.,98,,
567,0.97,4968.363,4975.637,Anyone else have any questions or comments.,98,,
