82,0.97,565.898,582.548,"I would also like to recommend that Sdot add another speed bump or two at minimum on 31st Avenue South between McClellan and grand streets, and painted Crosswalks installed which connects to the steps leading to Mount Baker park.",13,,
83,0.97,582.548,590.823,"I live in the middle of this long and straight section of road, that practically every day, I see cars doing 50.",13,,
84,0.97,590.823,607.139,"If Rainier becomes more gridlocked due to the recent transit, and Cycling improvements, the pressure on alternate routes, such as 31st Avenue South and Lake Washington Boulevard South will only increase.",13,,
85,0.97,607.139,609.408,A serious injury or fatality is only a matter of time.,13,,

94,0.97,649.181,655.187,"Cities like Edmonds, and Boston, and San Francisco have already smothered these with excessive fees and regulation.",15,,
95,0.97,655.187,658.29,We need to avoid doing the same in Seattle.,15,,
96,0.97,658.29,667.4,The one thing I'd like to draw your attention to is a quote on slide 15 which talks about focus on cost recovery as a goal.,15,,
97,0.97,667.4,672.938,And we don't think this is a worthy goal.,15,,
98,0.97,672.938,678.077,These basically don't exist just to make money for Sdot.,15,,
99,0.97,678.077,679.078,They strengthen public health.,15,,
100,0.97,679.078,692.024,"They create public space, which strengthens community, and increase public safety by cultivating a cared sense of place on the street, and people enjoy being in them, and it increases our quality of life.",15,,
101,0.97,692.024,699.365,"You know, a Tom Douglas restaurant may be able to pay high fees and jump through the regulatory hoops.",15,,
102,0.97,699.365,703.436,But we've heard from small mom and pop restaurants who just think that's too difficult.,15,,
103,0.97,703.436,708.707,So I'm hoping you will make sure that Sdot keeps the fees low.,15,,
104,0.97,708.707,720.386,"Less than $1,000, and the regulations as simple as possible, so every small business can partnership in this program, and the communities throughout Seattle can benefit from it.",15,,

113,0.97,773.439,782.148,Two things come to mind that I'd like to just raise as areas of concern.,18,,
114,0.97,782.148,796.195,"One is that the proposed legislation as written does not address how future port, or future truck designation will be made in industrial zoned areas.",18,,
115,0.97,796.195,799.064,How will residents and businesses be engaged on the Onset?,18,,
116,0.97,799.064,819.318,"We came into this particular legislation on the back end, and so that kind of RAISES a Spidey sense for me about how this might move forward in the future, especially in light of the draft, by EIS that is in front of us.",18,,
117,0.97,819.318,820.386,"The second, there's actually three things.",18,,
118,0.97,820.386,842.575,"The second thing I'd like to highlight is that a recent study provided by the city highlighted that industrial zoned areas are where inhabited vehicles most frequent, and I am interested in learning more about how the proposed fee structure and enforcement that might impact most.",18,,
119,0.97,842.575,855.154,"And Lastly, I'd like to note that the Georgetown area map that was used for the Hefron study is not correct by Seattle Department of neighborhoods map.",18,,

174,0.97,1157.523,1162.394,And thank you for the opportunity to present today.,25,,
175,0.97,1162.394,1182.447,"I wanted to walk through a little bit of background on truck parking, particularly with regard to the truck tractor parking, and for those of you who are not regularly involved in freight issues, the truck tractor is that front portion of the truck that's separate from the chassis or the box that you think of, when you think of a combination truck and trailer.",25,,
176,0.97,1182.447,1186.018,So it's that front portion of the truck that you see here in the image.,25,,
177,0.97,1186.018,1196.628,"I also want to make sure we talk about the parking impacts on our local neighborhoods, the agreement that we have with the port of Seattle, between the port of Seattle, and the city of Seattle.",25,,
178,0.97,1196.628,1207.339,"Discuss the legislation itself, and make sure we give you an opportunity to bring any questions or comments that you would like us to address formally.",25,,
179,0.97,1207.339,1221.82,The background on the purpose behind this legislation is aligned to allow us to designate and enforce exclusive truck parking in existing areas where truck parking is allowed.,25,,
180,0.97,1221.82,1236.635,"And as you mentioned earlier in the conversation, that is in adjacent to industrially zoned parcels, and we recognize there are mixed uses within industrially zoned parcels.",25,,
181,0.97,1236.635,1244.309,So that may mean there is currently legal truck parking in front of some residents.,25,,
182,0.97,1244.309,1248.18,"This legislation is not intended to address, or modify that in any way.",25,,
183,0.97,1248.18,1256.188,"What this does is create sign spaces in the right of way, that are dedicated to provide overnight parking for those truck tractors.",25,,
184,0.97,1256.188,1263.528,And that is the front portion of the truck exclusive of the trailer.,25,,
185,0.97,1263.528,1280.712,"The idea and the expectation is that we have people who will drive a truck during the day, park their truck, and drive a more fuel efficient vehicle the rest of the way home at the end of the day, as well as back in the morning to pick up their truck to complete their work.",25,,
186,0.97,1280.712,1298.53,"This legislation is consistent with some of the commitments that we outlined in 2007 with the community, and the agreement that the city and the port of Seattle entered with regard to the West Seattle bridge.",25,,
187,0.97,1298.53,1316.348,"So Drage drivers, that is that short haul, it's not the long haul Interstate sort of travel, and back and forth from a terminal to nearby facilities.",25,,
188,0.97,1316.348,1319.885,Typically multiple trips get made in a day by the same vehicle.,25,,
189,0.97,1319.885,1326.358,"They'll pick up a loaded chassis, deliver it, and back and forth.",25,,
190,0.97,1326.358,1336.335,"As I mentioned before, these drivers typically do choose to park their trucks overnight near where they're using them for their living.",25,,
191,0.97,1336.335,1345.077,That means that they are sometimes parking adjacent to properties with residential or commercial uses.,25,,
192,0.97,1345.077,1368.366,"Those truck drivers typically make the rest of their trip in a smaller, more fuel efficient vehicle, so we are cognizant that having these spaces available does decrease the carbon impact of this work because while those trucks are wonderful for moving large, heavy things, they're a little excessive for moving just a portion back and forth.",25,,
193,0.97,1368.366,1388.153,"Just to reiterate because I know this is a point that is potentially confusing for some members of the audience, overnight parking is all right limited, and that is not something we're looking at changing.",25,,
194,0.97,1388.153,1399.231,"As we mentioned earlier, Drayage drivers do have a hard time finding reliable parking overnight near the stations, we're hearing from some of the folks proposing public parking today as well.",25,,
195,0.97,1399.231,1420.185,"We've also heard the truck tractor parking does create challenges for residents and visitors, both in the concept of competition for local parking spaces and the noise and other challenges of having a large, loud vehicle in a Non- arterial street.",25,,
196,0.97,1420.185,1423.121,Just a moment to touch base on a previous action.,25,,
197,0.97,1423.121,1437.502,"The city of Seattle and port of Seattle entered into a fairly significant agreement associated with the West Seattle bridge, access to the low bridge and other freight and Bridge-Related items in the fall of last year.",25,,
198,0.97,1437.502,1461.46,"One of those items and part of the reason we're here today is based on a commitment to pursue parking spaces for Drayage drivers that are available to Drayage drivers, and that is of course contingent upon action, should city council choose to take them.",25,,
199,0.97,1461.46,1462.561,We started environmental analysis on this.,25,,
200,0.97,1462.561,1484.015,"What we did was we looked at the four locations that we had identified as potential locations, and we went through a sepia process Sepa process to identify between them.",25,,
201,0.97,1484.015,1487.419,The legislation is not limited to these locations.,25,,
202,0.97,1487.419,1491.823,It is a requested authority to those locations where parking can currently occur.,25,,
203,0.97,1491.823,1496.294,But we want today make sure we identified any concerns before we came to you.,25,,
204,0.97,1496.294,1504.469,We did not receive any comments during the Sepa comment period.,25,,
205,0.97,1504.469,1512.911,"However, we did get comments shortly thereafter from one of the constituents who spoke today.",25,,
206,0.97,1512.911,1528.393,"With respect to community engagement, we've had three community meetings, as well as In-Person outreach to the adjacent parcels to those four locations that we have previously proposed or that we are currently looking at.",25,,
207,0.97,1528.393,1529.961,We had a real mix of feedback.,25,,
208,0.97,1529.961,1569.0,"I would say that that changed from individuals who were concerned about loss of, or restrictions in their available use of the public space in front of their homes or businesses, on one end of the spectrum, perhaps in the middle is a concern that there was a desire for more community involvement and selection of locations, and on the other end of the spectrum, individuals who felt that it was important to help provide places for truckers for Drayage drivers to park their vehicles so they would not be parking within a community and not be competing for those same spaces.",25,,
209,0.97,1569.0,1575.106,"With that, I'll hand it over to Mike for details on the actual location unless there's questions now.",25,,
210,0.97,1575.106,1583.682,I just have two more slides really on the legislation itself.,26,,
211,0.97,1583.682,1584.282,"Good morning, Councilmembers.",26,,
212,0.97,1584.282,1585.55,My name is Mike Estey.,26,,
213,0.97,1585.55,1589.554,You can see there's a definition for truck tractor in the SMC.,26,,
214,0.97,1589.554,1601.7,"It's pretty much the exact type of vehicle that matt described, the Drayage vehicles seen in the image.",26,,
215,0.97,1601.7,1613.445,"This is the definition that has existed for decades actually, more recently, truck tractors were Referenced when the city adopted a system several years ago.",26,,
216,0.97,1613.445,1623.021,References to truck tractors are otherwise Typicaly associated with allowed sizes or weights and the combination of truck tractors or trailers and containers.,26,,
217,0.97,1623.021,1629.294,But until now there hasn't been an FMC reference to regulate their parking.,26,,
218,0.97,1629.294,1640.839,"So the legislation before you today would give s DOT authority for this particular vehicle type, and designate a portion for truck tractor parking only, for certain hours and specific locations.",26,,
219,0.97,1640.839,1658.256,"So going back to how these Drayage trucks are used, they typically end their day by parking off and on a city street, and driving their personal vehicle home, and the truck driver stays on the street overnight.",26,,
220,0.97,1658.256,1666.664,"Then they return it to their truck tractor and swap their vehicles out, and start their next work day.",26,,
221,0.97,1666.664,1673.571,"So with this authority, Sdot's intent is to assign spaces for truck tractor parking only overnight.",26,,
222,0.97,1673.571,1682.447,"So Formalizing this use in locations like harbor Island take the pressure off the demand for this type of parking you see on streets in this picture, which is probably in Georgetown, or South park.",26,,
223,0.97,1682.447,1702.2,"So through this legislation, we're hoping to better organize more of this type of overnight drainage truck parking, and as a result, more Drayage truck tractors will be closer to the port, that are less impact.",26,,
224,0.97,1702.2,1703.168,Than on residential streets.,26,,
225,0.97,1703.168,1709.541,"With that, I think we would entertain any questions or discussion.",26,,
226,0.97,1709.541,1710.408,Thank you very much.,27,,
227,0.97,1710.408,1720.318,"Disci want to let my colleagues know, we'll be voting on this at the next meeting, which will be Tuesday, August 3RD.",27,,
228,0.97,1720.318,1730.595,So today is the day for questions and you can obviously consult Calvin chow between now and August 3RD as well.,27,,
229,0.97,1730.595,1735.166,I do have a couple of questions that we can open up to colleagues.,27,,
230,0.97,1735.166,1758.456,"Thank you for the presentation that pulled together all the different sections of the Seattle municipal code, because it's spread out in different sections how this is administered, and so as I understand it, just to summarize, these truck tractors are already permitted to park overnight in industrial zones.",27,,
231,0.97,1758.456,1768.7,"This would be designating specific area, and giving authority to Sdot to designate specific areas that would then be enforced.",27,,
232,0.97,1768.7,1775.64,I guess one of my questions is--and I think you Referenced this in your presentation.,27,,
233,0.97,1775.64,1801.099,"So you've outlined four areas to harbor Island, one in Soto, one in Georgetown, I believe, where you want, where you're planning to designate it initially, but the legislation itself would give Sdot the authority to do this in other areas in the city that are industrial zone areas, is that correct?",27,,
234,0.97,1801.099,1803.968,"Yes, that is correct.",28,,
235,0.97,1803.968,1804.235,Okay.,29,,
236,0.97,1804.235,1812.51,So does Sdot currently have plans to have these designations in other areas of the city?,29,,
237,0.97,1812.51,1817.982,Not in so much as other locations that we've identified.,30,,
238,0.97,1817.982,1832.797,"We do have a discussion with the port with respect to how many locations we want to, or are able to accommodate within roadway right of way, versus on parcels that are either owned by the city, or by the port.",30,,
239,0.97,1832.797,1847.245,"So while we've identified these four locations, and have not identified any other locations, that conversation may continue to add locations, but not identified at this point.",30,,
240,0.97,1847.245,1864.696,"Okay, so I support the general concept of designating these spaces, and then adding the enforcement so it's clear that that's where they can park and Incentivizes them to choose those areas to park overnight, so that they're Consolidated in certain areas.",31,,
241,0.97,1864.696,1877.709,"One of the benefits of this legislation coming to us today is it did spur public comment for, from people who are in the areas that are initially being designated.",31,,
242,0.97,1877.709,1885.95,"But if you were to designate a new area six months from now, there wouldn't be this process.",31,,
243,0.97,1885.95,1902.867,"So I do want to think about whether we want to, when Sdot is going to designate other areas come back to counsel if Council if they were to structure it that way.",31,,
244,0.97,1902.867,1908.806,I think we do have questions from other Councilmembers.,31,,
245,0.97,1908.806,1909.407,"Yes, Councilmember Morales?",31,,
246,0.97,1909.407,1910.975,"Thank you, chair Pedersen.",32,,
247,0.97,1910.975,1912.143,Thanks for this presentation.,32,,
248,0.97,1912.143,1925.223,"It would be great if we could have the presentation, because it wasn't included on the agenda, so there's some information that would be helpful to have.",32,,
249,0.97,1925.223,1928.593,I think I'm supportive.,32,,
250,0.97,1928.593,1948.246,"But I do have some questions so you, I think it was slide six that said overnight truck tractor parking is already--is it already permitted or limited to industrial zone areas?",32,,
251,0.97,1948.246,1949.347,It's limited and allowed Essentialliy.,33,,
252,0.97,1949.347,1954.886,"In industrial zones of the city, you're allow today park basically a large vehicle overnight currently.",33,,
253,0.97,1954.886,1958.189,And only in industrial areas.,34,,
254,0.97,1958.189,1958.489,Correct.,35,,
255,0.97,1958.489,1958.756,Okay.,36,,
256,0.97,1958.756,1971.135,"Because I can tell you all of 55th Avenue South along bare Shiva Park, these trucks are there all the time.",36,,
257,0.97,1971.135,1974.939,So I'm trying to understand if that's allowed or not.,36,,
258,0.97,1974.939,1976.007,Sounds like it's not.,36,,
259,0.97,1976.007,1983.481,But there is a capacity issue and folks need a place to put their trucks.,36,,
260,0.97,1983.481,1987.719,So I'm interested in figuring out how we manage this.,36,,
261,0.97,1987.719,2006.437,"I think my question is similar to a question of public comments are made and the issue that chair Pedersen just raced, which is Calvin's memo says if Council APPROVES the administration, Sdot would establish the parking zones.",36,,
262,0.97,2006.437,2026.924,"I guess my question is in the future, or even for these existing sites, what are the criteria by which you decide where these zones should be so that we can start to understand where in the future these additional sites might be located?",36,,
263,0.97,2026.924,2027.191,Yeah.,37,,
264,0.97,2027.191,2050.515,"When we looked at these sites, what we looked at, and Mike will probably have to add a few things on, because it was a communal process between the team, we looked at access between the terminals that we know these drivers are using, because we know that that proximity, and that access for a larger vehicle is critical to the success of these locations.",37,,
265,0.97,2050.515,2062.226,"We also looked at what the adjacent utilization was, and the parking utilization currently was in the locations that we moved forward with.",37,,
266,0.97,2062.226,2077.141,"So we tried to balance the benefit from this parking with an acknowledgement that parking within the public right of way is maybe not a universal good, but a broadly shared good for our city.",37,,
267,0.97,2077.141,2082.647,I would essentially say the same thing.,38,,
268,0.97,2082.647,2085.883,"You know, we went through a Sepa process specific to these four sites.",38,,
269,0.97,2085.883,2097.261,"Another thing we have talked about is if we were to look at additional sites beyond these four, we may likely go through a similar process, combined with the community and the city.",38,,
270,0.97,2097.261,2103.434,"We weren't just sort of taking this authority and popping sites down site unseen, unexpected.",38,,
271,0.97,2103.434,2132.73,"But being thoughtful about in the ways that matt described with the criteria we're thinking about to be looking at sites where the adjacent uses were consistent, so that we can address things like the park that we described, but we're providing parking in place where it makes sense in the locations you observed, but doing that with more outage if we're looking at additional sites.",38,,
272,0.97,2132.73,2134.832,So can you talk about a couple of things then?,39,,
273,0.97,2134.832,2140.638,Do you have a sense of what the demand is?,39,,
274,0.97,2140.638,2144.275,And what capacity would these four sites provide?,39,,
275,0.97,2144.275,2149.013,"You know, what is the, do those things match?",39,,
276,0.97,2149.013,2157.188,"Then a Commenter was asking about, and I haven't had a chance to read through the written comments that we've received yet.",39,,
277,0.97,2157.188,2161.392,But there was a question about how residents will be engaged.,39,,
278,0.97,2161.392,2175.84,So can you talk a little about that process for these sites and for whatever future conversations you might be having as you mentioned you're already having some with the port.,39,,
279,0.97,2175.84,2182.88,"So, and my apologies if I don't catch all of those points, please correct me if I only address a couple of them.",40,,
280,0.97,2182.88,2194.625,"With the respect to the current locations, we are, we've gone out and discussed with the local parcel owners, or tenants, and/or tenants.",40,,
281,0.97,2194.625,2203.601,"In some cases we have modified our design, for example, location number two in the map, which was Referenced by one of the callers earlier in the meeting.",40,,
282,0.97,2203.601,2218.149,We modified our design because we discovered that our initial approach was not going to allow the trucks that the businesses needed to receive deliveries from to fully access their loading docks.,40,,
283,0.97,2218.149,2225.523,So for example in that case we modified our design to make sure we're providing the access necessary to those docks.,40,,
284,0.97,2225.523,2232.096,"In other cases, the adjacent businesses have indicated an awareness that this is a public good.",40,,
285,0.97,2232.096,2238.569,"And that these drainage drivers need a space, and have been welcoming in other locations.",40,,
286,0.97,2238.569,2244.108,There's been concern about displace parking by these drainage trucks.,40,,
287,0.97,2244.108,2245.443,So we've had some conversations.,40,,
288,0.97,2245.443,2250.915,Some of them I would say have been cordial.,40,,
289,0.97,2250.915,2253.417,Some have been intention.,40,,
290,0.97,2253.417,2265.396,"With respect to the demand to the degree this is satisfying it, we know there a thousands of trucks associated with drainage driving within the Seattle port facilities.",40,,
291,0.97,2265.396,2268.065,We're looking at serving a small fraction of them.,40,,
292,0.97,2268.065,2279.143,"There's a mix of larger company owned, a larger company might own several trucks all the way down to a single driver who might own their own vehicle or lease their own vehicle.",40,,
293,0.97,2279.143,2282.213,As you look at who's providing the drainage driving.,40,,
294,0.97,2282.213,2302.199,"Our goal here with this was to provide a bit of a proof of concept, but also to provide a little bit of a pressure release valve, because we know there is parking that's not happening legally, and it's happening in places that are disruptive to other places of our city.",40,,
295,0.97,2302.199,2323.154,"Thank you to that final point having, you know dozens of these trucks parked along a park where there's kids, particularly this particular intersection, 55th and Henderson, just across the street from Buena Beach high school.",41,,
296,0.97,2323.154,2323.921,Not a good conversation.,41,,
297,0.97,2323.921,2328.192,"Lots of kids in the neighborhood, and big trucks that can't see well.",41,,
298,0.97,2328.192,2329.293,Can't see kids on the street.,41,,
299,0.97,2329.293,2338.102,So it would be great if we could figure out how to help them find another place to park.,41,,
300,0.97,2338.102,2340.571,"Okay, thank you very much.",41,,
301,0.97,2340.571,2356.454,"I will probably have more questions, and I appreciate the chair indicating we won't be voting on this today, so I'll be following up with you.",41,,
302,0.97,2356.454,2358.122,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",42,,
303,0.97,2358.122,2359.957,It would be August 2ND.,42,,
304,0.97,2359.957,2365.029,"I previously said another date, but it would be Tuesday, August 2ND when we would vote on this.",42,,
305,0.97,2365.029,2367.064,Thank you Councilmember Morales for your questions.,43,,
306,0.97,2367.064,2378.109,"Just on the record saying, and I thinks this was said, just highlighting that this helps us address our climate crisis, because it means these trucks don't have to be driving on the road to and from.",43,,
307,0.97,2378.109,2389.987,"They get to stay where they're working, and many different drivers are able to use, you know, whether it's electrified vehicles or cars that use less gas.",43,,
308,0.97,2389.987,2394.425,This has that third bottom line as well much so looking forward to voting on it the next committee.,43,,
309,0.97,2394.425,2395.96,"Thank you, chair.",43,,
310,0.97,2395.96,2411.375,"Thank you, yes, I think we're hearing support for the concept, and just might have a couple of ways of tightening it up a little bit, which would then enable even more of these designated spaces in the future.",44,,
311,0.97,2411.375,2418.816,"Anything from central staff on this, at this point?",44,,
312,0.97,2418.816,2419.183,Hi Calvin.,44,,
313,0.97,2419.183,2420.751,I'll put you on the spot.,44,,
314,0.97,2420.751,2425.189,I'll be happy to work with your offices in the next couple of weeks.,45,,
315,0.97,2425.189,2425.556,Thank you.,46,,
316,0.97,2425.556,2429.827,We appreciate Sdot being here for this presentation.,46,,
317,0.97,2429.827,2443.874,"We'll see you back on August 2ND, and with that, we'll go ahead and have the clerk please read the next agenda item into record.",46,,
318,0.97,2443.874,2459.857,"Agenda item two, for the vacation of the portion of the alley and block founded by northeast 45Th street, Roosevelt way northeast, northeast 47Th street, and 11th Avenue North at 1,000 northeast 45Th street for briefing and discussion.",47,,
319,0.97,2459.857,2460.991,Thank you.,48,,
320,0.97,2460.991,2481.679,"Colleagues, as you may recall, we successfully arranged to have sound transit, generally lease their land to the city for a couple of years, which enabled us to create a 35 unit tiny home village, called rosy's village on Roosevelt way northeast, and has always been the ultimate goal for that site.",48,,
321,0.97,2481.679,2487.017,We want to build lots of permanent low income housing.,48,,
322,0.97,2487.017,2492.923,My hope is that we maximize the number of units at the deep Affordability levels.,48,,
323,0.97,2492.923,2497.962,We're close to light rail at that location.,48,,
324,0.97,2497.962,2510.307,"Ideally, they will serve households earning 60% of area income and I'd love to see at least 35 of the units set aside for extremely low income.",48,,
325,0.97,2510.307,2531.829,"The zero percent to 30% of AMI, my preliminary review of this, this is a preview of what sound transit is asking us to do, actually vote on it later, but I agree that vacating a portion of that alley could enable a non-profit housing developer to build more units.",48,,
326,0.97,2531.829,2548.746,"After the up zones of the U district, we've seen some Demolitions of naturally occurring affordable housing in the district, and most of the real estate developers building there are opting to write their in lieu check for affordable housing that is built elsewhere.",48,,
327,0.97,2548.746,2571.869,"But here is a site that we can build the low income housing on the light rail station, Onsite, and we'll see how vacating a part of that alley would impact this, and make it easier to do so again, today is just a preview of sound transit's petition.",48,,
328,0.97,2571.869,2578.509,It would be at a later meeting we potentially allow this alley location.,48,,
329,0.97,2578.509,2582.88,"We're joined today, I want to welcome sound transit for being here.",48,,
330,0.97,2582.88,2584.114,"Abel Pacheco, and Tim Bates.",48,,
331,0.97,2584.114,2596.794,"Of course we have our city council central staff, Lish Whitson, and our reliable Beverly Barnett as well.",48,,
332,0.97,2596.794,2603.067,"Lish, did you want to make any opening remarks before we turn it over to our other guests?",48,,
333,0.97,2603.067,2619.249,"Yeah, very briefly, when the Council updated the policies in 2018, they added in an early opportunity for Councilmembers to provide comments.",49,,
334,0.97,2619.249,2638.702,"Sound transit has filed the petition to vacate a portion of the alley on this block, next steps are to send it to the Seattle design Commission for their analysis and review of the petition.",49,,
335,0.97,2638.702,2645.242,This is your opportunity to provide your thoughts for things that should be considered as part of that review.,49,,
336,0.97,2645.242,2655.719,Both in terms of potential impacts of the vacation that could be mitigated and public benefits as part of the project.,49,,
337,0.97,2655.719,2664.895,So I'll hand it over to Beverly to provide more information on the process.,49,,
338,0.97,2664.895,2665.596,"Thank you, Lish.",50,,
339,0.97,2665.596,2665.963,Good morning.,50,,
340,0.97,2665.963,2666.397,Committee members.,50,,
341,0.97,2666.397,2678.008,"We really appreciate this opportunity, and it really is kind of fun for us to bring a brand new project here and receive some guidance from the Committee on things we should be looking at.",50,,
342,0.97,2678.008,2681.145,So the bulk of the presentation is going to be the Powerpoint.,50,,
343,0.97,2681.145,2687.484,"I think Tim's going to go over most of it, and able will have some comments on that as well.",50,,
344,0.97,2687.484,2699.997,But Lish in his very clear memo kind of outlined what we're doing here and why the Council added in this early opportunity for their guidance.,50,,
345,0.97,2699.997,2711.875,What is a little different with this is the city is working with sound transit to support sound transit going out for bid and selecting an affordable housing developer.,50,,
346,0.97,2711.875,2716.013,So we do not have a specific solid proposal in front of us.,50,,
347,0.97,2716.013,2724.488,"We're looking at the zoning code, and the physical area and the size to determine what might be built there.",50,,
348,0.97,2724.488,2742.239,"As you'll see from the sound transit presentation, their early feasibility analysis is that the alley vacation can't consolidate the site in a way Tha will really create much more of an opportunity for the development of affordable housing.",50,,
349,0.97,2742.239,2756.22,"I think from the Sdot perspective, because we don't have a specific project in front of us, we'll be really focusing our review and the conditions we recommend to Council on the clear impacts from the vacation.",50,,
350,0.97,2756.22,2762.793,So the first thing for us is of course looking at the function of the alley.,50,,
351,0.97,2762.793,2773.904,"As you'll see from the Powerpoint, sound transit only owns a portion of the property on the Southern end of the site at 45Th.",50,,
352,0.97,2773.904,2779.51,There are property owners to the North that still need and will continue to use the alley.,50,,
353,0.97,2779.51,2788.218,"So preserving access, utilities and other alley functions for other users is of critical importance.",50,,
354,0.97,2788.218,2795.592,We also look at how the new proposal will take care of their alley services.,50,,
355,0.97,2795.592,2804.268,So both the existing and future alley use has to be accommodated within the remaining alley right of way.,50,,
356,0.97,2804.268,2808.238,Another thing that we look at is the front facade.,50,,
357,0.97,2808.238,2816.48,"Since the alley is going away, we're looking at a longer facade on 45Th and perhaps that Intensifies the development there.",50,,
358,0.97,2816.48,2823.854,"So looking at that, the pedestrian character and the length will be issues we look at.",50,,
359,0.97,2823.854,2834.765,"Once we look at the physical world, we also look at community engagement, and the community interest in public benefit and what the public benefit proposal is.",50,,
360,0.97,2834.765,2841.572,"We'll be working with sound transit, and other city staff and we really look to the design Commission to help guide that.",50,,
361,0.97,2841.572,2851.281,"So we're going to be very tightly focused on the vacation impacts, and I think that will be made more clear as Tim and able go through the Powerpoint.",50,,
362,0.97,2851.281,2856.987,"So unless there is questions for me on what we're going to look at, I think we can just ask Tim.",50,,
363,0.97,2856.987,2861.592,I think Shauna was going to run this.,50,,
364,0.97,2861.592,2877.207,She always helps us with our presentations that Shauna was going to run this for Tim.,50,,
365,0.97,2877.207,2878.008,Okay.,51,,
366,0.97,2878.008,2879.276,Well good morning Councilmembers.,51,,
367,0.97,2879.276,2880.31,I'm Tim Bates.,51,,
368,0.97,2880.31,2883.28,I'm a senior Councilmember for TOD here at sound transit.,51,,
369,0.97,2883.28,2893.39,"I'm here to introduce the opportunity that we have, and talk a little about why we're interested in picking alley.",51,,
370,0.97,2893.39,2899.696,"I think we're doing a good job setting some context, so we'll try to add a little more to the story.",51,,
371,0.97,2899.696,2904.434,"So first off, we see our site here in the U district as a unique opportunity.",51,,
372,0.97,2904.434,2910.841,It's a chance to deliver much needed affordable housing.,51,,
373,0.97,2910.841,2920.15,"It's a publicly owned parcel, and it's a chance to see the full Protensity of the site.",51,,
374,0.97,2920.15,2924.922,"You can see here in the diagram, it's at the corner of 45Th and Roosevelt.",51,,
375,0.97,2924.922,2927.024,We think it's a great opportunity.,51,,
376,0.97,2927.024,2946.376,"I did want to just quickly say, you may know this, but I wanted to reiterate, our transit oriented development program seeks to Repurpose property that we've used during the construction of our transit projects and often that means Redeveloping those parcels for affordable housing.",51,,
377,0.97,2946.376,2951.682,"We work to set those projects up for success, but we don't actually build the projects.",51,,
378,0.97,2951.682,2962.326,"So we go out, we take our properties out to the market, and seek competitive bids typically to see those development outcomes realized.",51,,
379,0.97,2962.326,2966.563,So being all the context that you've heard SETS that all up.,51,,
380,0.97,2966.563,2966.93,That's great.,51,,
381,0.97,2966.93,2986.116,"I did want to note quickly before we move in, you know, our board of directors has not yet provided direction to us on this site, but affordable housing is a key outcome of our program, and indicating strong community support for affordable housing.",51,,
382,0.97,2986.116,2989.419,That's the working consumption for this site.,51,,
383,0.97,2989.419,2991.922,"Next slide, please introducing the alley vacation.",51,,
384,0.97,2991.922,3005.802,So we are working as Beverly suggested with the city here to vacate a portion of the alley in order to consolidate that site.,51,,
385,0.97,3005.802,3017.848,"So that, in our view will significantly increase the capacity of the site, and allow us to deliver more affordable housing, which would be a great outcome here.",51,,
386,0.97,3017.848,3022.619,"We're pursuing this before, as several have suggested, we don't have a specific development proposal yet.",51,,
387,0.97,3022.619,3031.228,We're trying to essentially clear the path since the Ocess and costly for proposal to pursue.,51,,
388,0.97,3031.228,3053.75,"We wanted to try to set this site up best for success and work through what the city's expectations would be, so that when we go out and try to select a development partner, they'll have a clear understanding of what that role would likely as they do their normal project approvals and all of that.",51,,
389,0.97,3053.75,3074.104,"You know, I think I do want to mention quickly, we expect that Beverly suggested when we go out to select, you know, to put out a bid, we would expect that we'd be able to express what the city's proposal would be, in terms of conditions, like Beverly said.",51,,
390,0.97,3074.104,3085.415,"We would expect that whatever the case, we do need to continue to serve all users, and I have all users on the block being able to use what remains of the alley.",51,,
391,0.97,3085.415,3092.856,"So we'll talk a little more about what that could look like, potentially.",51,,
392,0.97,3092.856,3112.275,"As Beverly would say, we reiterate we're at the start of the process, so we're excited to continue working with the city to deliver this both with staff from many departments, but also in partnership with the office of housing, who we are working with as a funding partner for this site.",51,,
393,0.97,3112.275,3112.742,"Next slide, please.",51,,
394,0.97,3112.742,3117.848,"Just quickly, it's a relatively small site that we have.",51,,
395,0.97,3117.848,3119.95,"It's about 18,000 square feet as it exists today.",51,,
396,0.97,3119.95,3132.963,"And the area that we're hoping to be able to vacate is a little over 1100 square feet, and really is just that portion that runs between our parcel.",51,,
397,0.97,3132.963,3133.964,It's a parcel that's split.,51,,
398,0.97,3133.964,3137.934,Beverly suggested there's a variety of users today.,51,,
399,0.97,3137.934,3141.671,There's really two other users on the block.,51,,
400,0.97,3141.671,3151.615,"There's a multifamily development on the East side, and there's currently a car dealership on the West side.",51,,
401,0.97,3151.615,3161.358,Although there is a development proposal in with the city under review for new development on that site that would include two towers.,51,,
402,0.97,3161.358,3166.363,"As you can imagine with changes in zoning, there's a lot of development that's happening.",51,,
403,0.97,3166.363,3178.275,"Even just in the immediate vicinity of the site, there are a variety of new buildings that are proposed.",51,,
404,0.97,3178.275,3180.677,Those range in the height range.,51,,
405,0.97,3180.677,3181.545,So a quite intense development.,51,,
406,0.97,3181.545,3187.951,"Our site, similarly is zoned for up to 320 feet with all of the bonuses that could be achieved.",51,,
407,0.97,3187.951,3199.262,"So it's meant to be part of this core of the U district, as least as far as the community planning has been done.",51,,
408,0.97,3199.262,3201.164,"With that, let's move onto the next slide please.",51,,
409,0.97,3201.164,3206.369,Just a quick set of photos here to show you what it looks like today.,51,,
410,0.97,3206.369,3211.608,"On the left side, we've got a view from sort of the alley as it crosses through sound transit's property.",51,,
411,0.97,3211.608,3216.613,"Looking to the North, and you can see that multifamily building on the right side.",51,,
412,0.97,3216.613,3220.45,You can see the car dealership there on the left.,51,,
413,0.97,3220.45,3229.459,"And then, on the right is looking South, and actually shows the alley as it narrows, as it goes through our site.",51,,
414,0.97,3229.459,3234.164,"So through our site, it's only 10 feet wide, and it gets a little wider to the North end of the block.",51,,
415,0.97,3234.164,3238.768,That gives you a little bit of context there.,51,,
416,0.97,3238.768,3266.029,"Of course, you know, as Beverly eluded to, both for our TOD planning process, and also the alley vacation way process, community engagement is important, and we have done some work thus far over the course of 2021 to engage the community through Online surveying, and Online open houses, to gauge their interest and priorities for the site, and really what we heard was affordable housing was a top priority.",51,,
417,0.97,3266.029,3273.737,"Probably the top priority from the community's perspective, and that there was a strong desire to try to maximize the affordable housing outcome here.",51,,
418,0.97,3273.737,3281.044,That's sort of giving rise to all of this to try to really unlock the potential of the site.,51,,
419,0.97,3281.044,3288.685,", if the community is also interested in a space that serves more Factive use for the community, such as for retail on that sort.",51,,
420,0.97,3288.685,3293.657,"Of course, very interested in the pedestrian environment here.",51,,
421,0.97,3293.657,3294.157,As Beverly eluded to.,51,,
422,0.97,3294.157,3298.461,And of course interested in a building that has strong environmental proponents.,51,,
423,0.97,3298.461,3310.473,Those are the things we've heard so far in our engagement work that I think really line up well with our aims here with this vacation.,51,,
424,0.97,3310.473,3310.907,"Next slide, please.",51,,
425,0.97,3310.907,3338.635,"So what we're really looking at as we put together the pieces here is we're targeting an affordable housing project, so we'll bring the funding really to deliver this, as you no doubt know, most affordable housing projects do have a financial gap, so there's funds that need to may be it happen.",51,,
426,0.97,3338.635,3345.175,That's office of housing bringing that in.,51,,
427,0.97,3345.175,3352.849,"And you know, we're trying to to maximize the site capacity, so we get a better outcome here.",51,,
428,0.97,3352.849,3354.751,Public benefit is a key topic here.,51,,
429,0.97,3354.751,3365.795,"Although we don't have a final concrete proposal, we have had ideas come up in the work we've done so far, including the community engagement work.",51,,
430,0.97,3365.795,3374.871,First one was about the idea of including the cultural space agency as a ground floor use in the building.,51,,
431,0.97,3374.871,3397.46,"So that could be a new city agency, as you know, that would well provide for studio space, gathering space, programming, to create space for artists and creative communities, with emphasis on the Bipoc community.",51,,
432,0.97,3397.46,3415.712,"Another is about the pedestrian environment, and creating an East-West pass through that would sort of take that long block and make it a little more pedestrian friendly, give a way for folks to get from Roosevelt to 11th.",51,,
433,0.97,3415.712,3417.747,That was another thing that came up.,51,,
434,0.97,3417.747,3418.248,"Next slide, please.",51,,
435,0.97,3418.248,3426.99,"I wanted to build on that NOTE on circulation, just quickly, to let you all know that each of the streets surrounding the site are major Arterials.",51,,
436,0.97,3426.99,3432.695,So that's part of why this emphasis is on maintaining the alley function.,51,,
437,0.97,3432.695,3440.036,So woe know there are user Thews need to be able to use this in the midst of a really Bsy district.,51,,
438,0.97,3440.036,3446.509,"So northeast, a key pedestrian corridor, so that front will be really important like Beverly suggested.",51,,
439,0.97,3446.509,3460.29,"We know that there are, when we talk about bicycle connections, there are bicycle facilities in the area, there's a planned facility on Northbound 11.",51,,
440,0.97,3460.29,3475.138,"Adding in more busyness and activity into the area, so all of that again, just thinking about how does the overall circulation network continue to function, and how do we preserve that function of the Alleyway itself?",51,,
441,0.97,3475.138,3475.638,"Next slide, please.",51,,
442,0.97,3475.638,3482.412,"So Finally, I just wanted to talk a little about the development capacity of the site.",51,,
443,0.97,3482.412,3483.513,I've eluded to that several times.,51,,
444,0.97,3483.513,3488.518,We want to talk about why we think this vacation is going to be so Impactful.,51,,
445,0.97,3488.518,3502.498,"So today, the way the site is currently Configured, we don't believe that high rise development, or density development as envisioned by the zoning is possible on the site.",51,,
446,0.97,3502.498,3508.905,That's because the floor plates are too small to provide an efficient building.,51,,
447,0.97,3508.905,3517.347,"It's also, knowing that there's proposed high rise development on the North side of the site, we need to have some separation from those towers.",51,,
448,0.97,3517.347,3525.355,All of that results in not having enough floor plate to make a really tall building here.,51,,
449,0.97,3525.355,3533.997,"If we were able to achieve the vacation, we do think that a high rise building would be potentially possible, even meeting that tower separation requirement.",51,,
450,0.97,3533.997,3544.941,"You can see here on the slide, we've illustrated a relatively gross area that could potentially be a building Footprint for a high rise building.",51,,
451,0.97,3544.941,3557.12,"Of course there's lots of considerations on how you design a high rise building and what the set backs are, and how you Configure all the develop.",51,,
452,0.97,3557.12,3557.353,Ments.,51,,
453,0.97,3557.353,3564.627,"But just in a top line view, we think that potentially shifts the floor plate to the South side of the site there.",51,,
454,0.97,3564.627,3566.329,So that's sort of the first bit.,51,,
455,0.97,3566.329,3567.83,"Let's go to the next slide, please.",51,,
456,0.97,3567.83,3577.14,"In order to maintain the alley function as we look at this, of course the pedestrian and parking access for the block is going to be important.",51,,
457,0.97,3577.14,3579.175,Service and utility vehicles as well use the alley.,51,,
458,0.97,3579.175,3598.695,"So we want to be able to find a solution that both allows us to retain the circulation, and Reconfigure it while also retaining and creating that high rise floor plate.",51,,
459,0.97,3598.695,3602.665,Here I've illustrate a few ideas.,51,,
460,0.97,3602.665,3611.007,"Of course, they're concepts, they're sketches to illustrate what some of the options might be.",51,,
461,0.97,3611.007,3626.189,"But in essence, we think either realigning the area one way or nor, or East or West, or a turn around, could be viable solutions that provide that function, but also allow for a high rise floor plate.",51,,
462,0.97,3626.189,3633.796,You may note that either of those options would consume a fair amount of land on sound transit's property.,51,,
463,0.97,3633.796,3643.339,"However, we would still, we think, be able to create that high rise floor plate, even despite that.",51,,
464,0.97,3643.339,3654.25,"So, again, this is all work they'll we'll need to continue working with Sdot and other departments to figure out the solution Leer.",51,,
465,0.97,3654.25,3657.787,But we did want to illustrate some of the ideas that have come up so far.,51,,
466,0.97,3657.787,3660.556,"So with that, that's the end of the slides.",51,,
467,0.97,3660.556,3666.663,I would be happy to hear discussion and take any questions that you may have.,51,,
468,0.97,3666.663,3668.431,Thank you very much.,52,,
469,0.97,3668.431,3683.379,"I just want to reiterate my thanks for sound transit working in partnership with the city on this site for so long and into the future here, and I appreciate this presentation.",52,,
470,0.97,3683.379,3684.414,We see Councilmember Strauss.,52,,
471,0.97,3684.414,3684.614,Yes.,52,,
472,0.97,3684.614,3684.947,Thank you.,53,,
473,0.97,3684.947,3694.49,"Tim, if you could circle back to the alley configuration slides, that would be very helpful and actually sit on this next slide for a minute.",53,,
474,0.97,3694.49,3697.427,The one in between.,53,,
475,0.97,3697.427,3708.171,I just think this really helps us understand that without an alley vacation or options are more limited.,53,,
476,0.97,3708.171,3723.82,"With an alley vacation, we're able to provide a high frequency corridor adjacent to Interstate 5. I'll note that we need to be figuring out how we get people across Interstate 5 on that bridge.",53,,
477,0.97,3723.82,3726.823,I know Councilmember Pedersen AGREES wholeheartedly with me.,53,,
478,0.97,3726.823,3730.46,"So sound transit, I might ask for your help here.",53,,
479,0.97,3730.46,3740.937,"Back to the topic at hand, this slide really illustrates for us that we're able to create the density we need, in the place that we need it.",53,,
480,0.97,3740.937,3745.641,"Now if you could move to slide ten, that would be helpful.",53,,
481,0.97,3745.641,3750.513,"What's key for me in this moment, is each of these options are used throughout our city.",53,,
482,0.97,3750.513,3762.091,"I see in Greenwood that we have alleys that have been realigned off of Greenwood, so they are East/West facing until they get to green Avenue.",53,,
483,0.97,3762.091,3763.292,They make changes like this.,53,,
484,0.97,3763.292,3767.13,This is along 14th Avenue Northwest in Ballard.,53,,
485,0.97,3767.13,3767.764,The same thing happens.,53,,
486,0.97,3767.764,3778.04,"What is important for me in this moment is to not as much the vehicular travel, but what is the pedestrian connection?",53,,
487,0.97,3778.04,3781.644,We allow for the Seattle times building to be Redeveloped.,53,,
488,0.97,3781.644,3785.081,"That took the entire block, and how were pedestrians able to make crossings?",53,,
489,0.97,3785.081,3793.99,"Did they have to go all the way around the block, or were they able to make Mid-Block crossing?",53,,
490,0.97,3793.99,3800.129,"So I just flag for sound transit, Beverly, you're always amazing with this.",53,,
491,0.97,3800.129,3801.33,It's more than just the cars.,53,,
492,0.97,3801.33,3806.002,How do the people get through the spots?,53,,
493,0.97,3806.002,3806.903,"In some ways, no vacation.",53,,
494,0.97,3806.903,3818.214,"We can achieve the same results for pedestrians with no vacation, as we can with any of these other options if we're able to create a Mid-Block pass through.",53,,
495,0.97,3818.214,3820.85,So I'll leave that up for further discussion.,53,,
496,0.97,3820.85,3824.12,I'll just raise that it's more than just cars.,53,,
497,0.97,3824.12,3824.554,"Thank you, chair.",53,,
498,0.97,3824.554,3825.421,Thank you.,54,,
499,0.97,3825.421,3846.509,"I really appreciate the opening remarks from Beverly Barnett as well about all the things that Sdot would be looking at, including use by Seattle public utilities, the recycling trucks, emergency vehicles and such.",55,,
500,0.97,3846.509,3847.009,Councilmember Morales.,55,,
501,0.97,3847.009,3848.01,"Thank you, chair.",56,,
502,0.97,3848.01,3854.283,Thanks for this presentation and for bringing it to us in early days.,56,,
503,0.97,3854.283,3864.46,I'm excited to hear the mention of the cultural space PDA.,56,,
504,0.97,3864.46,3883.579,"That kind of a an entity is exactly what I would like to see, and I would put in a public for keeping this in public ownership, and instead leasing it to a developer so we get the benefit of the affordable housing that we all know we need, and we keep it in public ownership, rather than sell off this land.",56,,
505,0.97,3883.579,3896.125,"I think that is one way for us to address the Permanency of Affordability, and look forward to working with you to figure out how we might be able to make that happen.",56,,
506,0.97,3896.125,3897.96,"Thank you Councilmember, Morales.",57,,
507,0.97,3897.96,3911.641,"I know when the city government has land, I too, prefer that they look at a 99 year lease.",57,,
508,0.97,3911.641,3922.785,"I didn't know Tim or able, does sound transit after look at that issue of doing a 99 year lease that can be renewed?",57,,
509,0.97,3922.785,3927.823,With the land?,57,,
510,0.97,3927.823,3930.426,"Yeah, we have done that.",58,,
511,0.97,3930.426,3930.626,Yes.,58,,
512,0.97,3930.626,3930.86,Sorry.,58,,
513,0.97,3930.86,3937.166,"We've done disposition both as a fee title transfer, you know, sales to developers.",58,,
514,0.97,3937.166,3940.636,We've also done long term leases like that.,58,,
515,0.97,3940.636,3946.375,"You know, every project is sort of unique.",58,,
516,0.97,3946.375,3952.548,"I think that's not perhaps super helpful refrain, but a refrain that is perhaps not a surprise.",58,,
517,0.97,3952.548,3959.055,So we do consider different ways of disposing the property.,58,,
518,0.97,3959.055,3975.771,"Having the, an option for street level uses being cultural community versus retail office, do those, and maybe this is a question for Beverly or Lish as well.",59,,
519,0.97,3975.771,3977.44,But do we see those spaces?,59,,
520,0.97,3977.44,3983.846,Do they pay rent to contribute to the overall costs and operations of the project?,59,,
521,0.97,3983.846,3985.681,Or is it usually a reduced rent?,59,,
522,0.97,3985.681,3994.357,Because I would imagine it's harder for them to generate revenue.,59,,
523,0.97,3994.357,4005.768,We did see the cultural space agency receiving space as part of the grand Street comment certification that was just approved in the past year.,60,,
524,0.97,4005.768,4020.583,"In that case, they did not pay for the space, but I think they do pay common charges, so there are some costs.",60,,
525,0.97,4020.583,4021.25,Okay.,61,,
526,0.97,4021.25,4022.051,Thank you again.,61,,
527,0.97,4022.051,4028.691,Appreciate previous city council's crafting these policies so that we get this early look.,61,,
528,0.97,4028.691,4049.512,"And then after this, the two step process of considering alley vacations and then making sure that any conditions are met and I appreciate again Beverly Barnett from Sdot going through the long list of things we will be looking at.",61,,
529,0.97,4049.512,4070.9,"Obviously, we're really focused today on maximizing low income housing production, especially near such frequent transit, and glad that Sdot and our central staff will be looking at all the issues, such as emergency vehicle access, and access for recycling trucks and the general circulation there.",61,,
530,0.97,4070.9,4076.105,And what the impacts will be to the adjacent streets.,61,,
531,0.97,4076.105,4080.709,"Whether you choose the West alignment, or East alignment instead of a turn around.",61,,
532,0.97,4080.709,4092.088,"But appreciate the partnership with sound transit, and we'll keep working Collaboratively with you on this, so we can maximize a public benefit for everybody.",61,,
533,0.97,4092.088,4096.992,"Councilmembers, any other final questions for our team here?",61,,
534,0.97,4096.992,4097.193,Okay.,61,,
535,0.97,4097.193,4100.696,"Well thank you, able and Tim for being here with us.",61,,
536,0.97,4100.696,4102.598,"Thanks Beverly, and Lish.",61,,
537,0.97,4102.598,4102.932,Thank you.,62,,
538,0.97,4102.932,4103.365,All right.,63,,
539,0.97,4103.365,4106.035,We will move onto the next item.,63,,
540,0.97,4106.035,4112.508,Will the clerk please read the full title of the next agenda item into the record?,63,,
541,0.97,4112.508,4113.375,Agenda item three.,64,,
542,0.97,4113.375,4118.814,Safe start permit briefing for briefing and discussion.,64,,
543,0.97,4118.814,4119.582,Thank you.,65,,
544,0.97,4119.582,4129.925,So this Sdot program has provided permits for restaurants and stores to use sidewalks and curb space during the economic downturn of the pandemic.,65,,
545,0.97,4129.925,4135.331,"Today, we're getting an update from Sdot to hear about the potential plans for the future.",65,,
546,0.97,4135.331,4144.907,I didn't know if anybody wanted to make any introductory remarks on this.,65,,
547,0.97,4144.907,4156.118,"I mean, I've got more to say than we've got time for in this committee meeting.",66,,
548,0.97,4156.118,4157.153,We've got Calvin back.,67,,
549,0.97,4157.153,4165.161,"Calvin, did you have any opening remarks for this item?",67,,
550,0.97,4165.161,4166.362,No thank you.,68,,
551,0.97,4166.362,4166.762,Thank you.,69,,
552,0.97,4166.762,4168.03,"Please, Councilmember Strauss.",69,,
553,0.97,4168.03,4183.646,"Just to say, you know, when the pandemic hit and we were no longer able to eat inside, due to health safety requirements, we were able to pitch Ott and use outdoor space in a way that we hadn't used before.",70,,
554,0.97,4183.646,4196.192,"Seattle had not been a street and outdoor dining city, previously, and it's clear that there was a lot of PENT up desire for it.",70,,
555,0.97,4196.192,4210.272,"What I saw is Sdot Prioritized getting permits out the door, and took the time that they needed to create permanent legislation.",70,,
556,0.97,4210.272,4222.851,"Sdot focused on the priorities at hand, ensuring businesses could use their entrepreneurial city.",70,,
557,0.97,4222.851,4228.157,I think it saved hundreds of businesses throughout the city.,70,,
558,0.97,4228.157,4230.96,It was this team that you're going to see presenting today.,70,,
559,0.97,4230.96,4236.665,"It's a very small team, and they focused on getting permits out the door, so that businesses could survive.",70,,
560,0.97,4236.665,4247.076,"In the meantime on the Pathway to Permanency, they've taken the time to get the policies right sized for our city, and that's the discussion we're going to have for today.",70,,
561,0.97,4247.076,4256.352,"Thank you to Alyse and Joel for making this happen, and saving so many businesses in our city.",70,,
562,0.97,4256.352,4257.386,Thank you Councilmember.,71,,
563,0.97,4257.386,4257.886,Welcome Alyse and Joel.,71,,
564,0.97,4257.886,4261.123,Let's turn it over to you and your presentation.,71,,
565,0.97,4261.123,4266.562,Thank you for the remarks Councilmember Strauss.,72,,
566,0.97,4266.562,4272.468,That was very nice and we're excited to be here today and give you an update.,72,,
567,0.97,4272.468,4279.408,"I'm Alyse Nelson, I'm the Department Street manager with Sdot.",72,,
568,0.97,4279.408,4280.809,Joining me is Joel Miller.,72,,
569,0.97,4280.809,4290.352,"We're happy to be with you today to give you this briefing, and providing an update on our Street and sidewalk activity programs.",72,,
570,0.97,4290.352,4294.823,"So next slide, please.",72,,
571,0.97,4294.823,4295.491,"One back, please.",72,,
572,0.97,4295.491,4298.827,This is our Sdot vision and core value slide.,72,,
573,0.97,4298.827,4306.702,"We like to have these in our presentations to kind of ground our work and this vision and mission, and core value.",72,,
574,0.97,4306.702,4327.99,"So for this program, we see that our work to support businesses and communities and the right of way really helps deliver, and we're trying to work to create a program that enhances neighborhood Liveability, but also that enhances Sustainability, and Liveability.",72,,
575,0.97,4327.99,4336.699,"We don't have long today, so this will be a really brief highlight, and we'll go our our background, outreach, and themes, and really start to talk about our draft recommendations.",72,,
576,0.97,4336.699,4350.179,"Then we will have more information that will be available on our Sdot web page, and we're really looking forward to hearing from you, and the public on what they think about where we are so far.",72,,
577,0.97,4350.179,4350.512,Next slide.,72,,
578,0.97,4350.512,4354.45,I'd like to try to provide us a quick 101.,72,,
579,0.97,4354.45,4361.557,"I know people can use a lot of jargon, we're going to talk about different areas within the right of way.",72,,
580,0.97,4361.557,4366.662,So number one on this little map is curb space.,72,,
581,0.97,4366.662,4369.665,That's where parking generally happens.,72,,
582,0.97,4369.665,4383.779,"Then there's two that's the furniture zone, that's where you might find Street trees, fire Hydrants, that kind of thing, then there's number three, which is the frontage zone.",72,,
583,0.97,4383.779,4389.585,"In between the frontage, and furniture zone, you'll find something we call the pedestrian clear zone.",72,,
584,0.97,4389.585,4399.328,"That's the part of the sidewalk we want to make sure is available for people walking and rolling, and to make sure we're providing adequate Parkability.",72,,
585,0.97,4399.328,4405.0,This is a Timeline slide just to Orient you to where we've been.,72,,
586,0.97,4405.0,4411.707,We call this the safe start program that was aligned with governor Inslee's naming.,72,,
587,0.97,4411.707,4419.815,"It was a pandemic program to get people out in the public right of way, when it wasn't safe to be inside.",72,,
588,0.97,4419.815,4428.624,"It launched in the summer of 2020, and we worked to quickly turn around permits that were free.",72,,
589,0.97,4428.624,4435.998,"We've still been issuing permits, and continue to during the pandemic program.",72,,
590,0.97,4435.998,4447.709,"In 2021, we began to listen, and learn to what really was working well with the pandemic program and think about what we might want to do to modify our existing permit and programs that we had.",72,,
591,0.97,4447.709,4454.383,"So the recommendations will include Edits to the Seattle municipal code, Sdot director's rules.",72,,
592,0.97,4454.383,4461.356,"We're here today to kind of give you an update, and we'll be back this fall for further Council action.",72,,
593,0.97,4461.356,4470.866,"The state program ends in 2023, which is when we plan to transition back to our permits.",72,,
594,0.97,4470.866,4480.342,We expect all permit holders to Reapply.,72,,
595,0.97,4480.342,4490.986,We currently have the pandemic program ending at the beginning of July.,72,,
596,0.97,4490.986,4491.32,Next slide.,72,,
597,0.97,4491.32,4504.633,"Just briefly, we see that this work Aligns with citywide plans such as the comprehensive plan Sdot model plans, our Sdot transportation equity framework, and also with our climate city council goals.",72,,
598,0.97,4504.633,4510.506,We just want to highlight that policy support that exists for this program.,72,,
599,0.97,4510.506,4514.376,Next slide.,72,,
600,0.97,4514.376,4516.945,We have been busy with outreach.,72,,
601,0.97,4516.945,4523.051,"Since the summer of 2021, we really wanted to learn what was working well during the pandemic.",72,,
602,0.97,4523.051,4527.122,We had a Multipronged approach to our outreach.,72,,
603,0.97,4527.122,4530.692,"We conducted surveys, we held meetings.",72,,
604,0.97,4530.692,4536.798,We met with community groups and focused each outreach to hear specifically from people of color.,72,,
605,0.97,4536.798,4543.605,"We did door-to-door outreach to ensure people knew about our survey, and we also connected evaluations.",72,,
606,0.97,4543.605,4557.753,"Just to highlight, our public survey was really successful in that we heard from ten thousand respondents, which we were really happy to have that much feedback to help ground our work.",72,,
607,0.97,4557.753,4558.053,Next slide.,72,,
608,0.97,4558.053,4565.16,So this slide is actually a quick graphic that shows what we heard and learned from our public outreach survey.,72,,
609,0.97,4565.16,4572.334,"The one that had 10,000 Respondnts.",72,,
610,0.97,4572.334,4576.104,You'll see overwhelmingly positive results.,72,,
611,0.97,4576.104,4579.341,Vending uses were also highly Sported.,72,,
612,0.97,4579.341,4580.242,So were retail displays.,72,,
613,0.97,4580.242,4585.881,"Although a little less supportive than everything else, still positive.",72,,
614,0.97,4585.881,4586.181,Next slide.,72,,
615,0.97,4586.181,4591.653,"So we kind of stopped there, and said Hey, what are we learning in this?",72,,
616,0.97,4591.653,4601.697,"We learned other strong support for the program, and there was support to lower barriers so people could partnership.",72,,
617,0.97,4601.697,4603.432,Sometimes permitting agencies get a bad wrap.,72,,
618,0.97,4603.432,4609.838,"But we were seeing as a partner during the pandemic, and we want to continue that.",72,,
619,0.97,4609.838,4614.643,"Finally, we asked everyone, what do you like and what don't you like?",72,,
620,0.97,4614.643,4623.986,"So we made sure to hear what people didn't like, even if they liked the program.",72,,
621,0.97,4623.986,4631.226,So from all of that work we wanted to develop some themes to guide our work.,72,,
622,0.97,4631.226,4636.865,"And we have these three themes, equity, flexibility, and a collaborative approach.",72,,
623,0.97,4636.865,4647.609,"We want to make sure our program supports Bipoc businesses and want to make sure our plans are clear and consistent, but also adaptable overtime, so we continue to learn and improve.",72,,
624,0.97,4647.609,4657.352,One of the ways that we'll do this is by moving some of the detail standards from the municipal code to Sdot rules for easier updates as we learned.,72,,
625,0.97,4657.352,4661.89,"Finally, we want to ensure we have time and space for applicant coaching.",72,,
626,0.97,4661.89,4672.0,We want to create simple educational tools that help people be able to partnership and understand what it takes to get a permit.,72,,
627,0.97,4672.0,4672.334,Next slide?,72,,
628,0.97,4672.334,4678.607,"Now we're going to dig in a little deeper to our draft recommendation, starting with outdoor dining.",72,,
629,0.97,4678.607,4694.656,"We really want to focus on creating great spaces that are visually Permable, and built for the urban environment, so they're intended to last, and can be easy to clean and maintain.",72,,
630,0.97,4694.656,4699.127,We do plan to continue to offer overhead structures and pop up tents.,72,,
631,0.97,4699.127,4707.903,In some cases we will need to have stamped Clans to make sure things hold up.,72,,
632,0.97,4707.903,4719.648,"We do plan to allow for platforms and not require them, but they will be encouraged, and they're one way to meet Ada requirements to provide seating access.",72,,
633,0.97,4719.648,4724.786,"Finally, we plan to set a Max up length for the curb space cafes of 40 feet.",72,,
634,0.97,4724.786,4736.364,It will Pend review of the site conditions to make sure there's adequate space for other curb space use as well.,72,,
635,0.97,4736.364,4742.771,"So for vending, our food and flower Venders have been really hard hit during the pandemic.",72,,
636,0.97,4742.771,4748.643,"You know, when everybody went home, their typical customers were not where they were typically getting their lunch orders.",72,,
637,0.97,4748.643,4763.892,"So we want to look for ways to reduce barriers for vendors, and have Venders be able to bend where people are, by providing flexible Buffers, and giving the flexibility where people are, and where Venders would like to be.",72,,
638,0.97,4763.892,4781.877,"We also want to try out some new types of vending, really, provide a trial permit for new Venders to try out sites that they're not sure if they'll pan out at a lower Upfront cost, so they can try it out with less risk.",72,,
639,0.97,4781.877,4782.177,Next slide.,72,,
640,0.97,4782.177,4793.255,"Next is our Street closures, during the pandemic, we extended our offers to allow for a longer term in seasonal closures to support business activities.",72,,
641,0.97,4793.255,4800.162,"This worked well, particularly where there were conditions that didn't work well for street space use.",72,,
642,0.97,4800.162,4813.875,"We saw some very successful examples, such as the Ballard Avenue cafe street, 11th Avenue, and Pike and pine, Occidental, and Pioneer square and Crockett, and Queen Anne.",72,,
643,0.97,4813.875,4831.493,"Based on the pandemic success, we'd like to continue to offer those closures we began during the pandemic, and add that to our tool kit as more day-to-day Street closure activities.",72,,
644,0.97,4831.493,4838.767,"Last, but not least is our merchandise display permit.",72,,
645,0.97,4838.767,4848.81,We think that it might be simpler for folks that are retail businesses just to be able to set up small building frontage displays without a permit moving forward.,72,,
646,0.97,4848.81,4858.386,"So we're looking to have standards that they could follow, but without a permit required in the building frontage zone.",72,,
647,0.97,4858.386,4869.631,"For furniture displays, it's a bit harder to get it right, so we'll still have a permit so we can check for the conditions and guide business through that process.",72,,
648,0.97,4869.631,4887.782,"Finally, we tried out merchandising display on the curb space, and didn't see widespread use based on continued use of the curb, we plan to no longer allow curb space merchandise display except for as a component of the street closure permit.",72,,
649,0.97,4887.782,4888.45,Next slide.,72,,
650,0.97,4888.45,4891.486,"Finally, I wanted to give a highlight of commit fees.",72,,
651,0.97,4891.486,4899.027,"We waived our permit fees during the pandemic, but we'll reintroduce them.",72,,
652,0.97,4899.027,4910.872,"In 2023, we're looking to create a simple fee structure to level the playing field for all outdoor dining spaces where they're on the sidewalk or curb space.",72,,
653,0.97,4910.872,4918.046,We want to lower fees for public street and sidewalk activities including those small and Mid-Scale events.,72,,
654,0.97,4918.046,4931.059,This would make it easier for community organizations to hold events that aren't fitting in our community block program.,72,,
655,0.97,4931.059,4934.896,"Finally, we recognize that Businessing may be still hard hit from the pandemic.",72,,
656,0.97,4934.896,4944.839,"We are looking for ways to lower barriers, such as having permits spaced out overtime, rather than a lump sum.",72,,
657,0.97,4944.839,4954.849,"My next one is my last one, just that we're happy to be with you to talk to you today, and we're appreciative of your time and we look forward to any questions you might have.",72,,
658,0.97,4954.849,4955.984,Thank you very much.,73,,
659,0.97,4955.984,4962.157,I have a couple of questions.,73,,
660,0.97,4962.157,4967.595,Could you go back to slide nine?,73,,
661,0.97,4967.595,4983.178,"So a big picture is Sdot's proposal, or is the idea here that post pandemic, that Sdot would be wanting to make some of these changes permanent?",73,,
662,0.97,4983.178,4994.823,"Yes, we already had existing programs for all of these uses, so we want to take what we learned, and bring it into our permanent permitting options.",74,,
663,0.97,4994.823,5022.45,"What is the process you use, or would be using, if, let's say there's several Takeout establishments where there's no dining there, it's primarily Takeout, but then you have a bar or a restaurant that wants to use the parking directly outside where the delivery pickup usually occurs?",75,,
664,0.97,5022.45,5034.362,"So if a restaurant says Hey, I want to use the space, are you Úchecking with the adjacent businesses to make sure it doesn't negatively impact their business?",75,,
665,0.97,5034.362,5035.563,That's a great question.,76,,
666,0.97,5035.563,5041.669,Well we do plan to have a public comment period on the applications moving forward.,76,,
667,0.97,5041.669,5046.541,"So that will be one way to hear from people that are nearby, what they think about the use.",76,,
668,0.97,5046.541,5054.215,Then the other thing I'll say is we work closely with our Sdot curb site.,76,,
669,0.97,5054.215,5065.96,"Mike Estey was here earlier, to understand the curb space needs on any given block and to kind of consider how this activation use fits into any needed space for access like loading.",76,,
670,0.97,5065.96,5072.934,"So that public comment period you mentioned, that would be for each permit?",77,,
671,0.97,5072.934,5073.201,Yes.,78,,
672,0.97,5073.201,5073.735,Okay.,79,,
673,0.97,5073.735,5082.844,And then would you mind going to slide 12?,79,,
674,0.97,5082.844,5089.15,"There's a bullet point there, allow vending in neighborhood residential zones.",79,,
675,0.97,5089.15,5092.187,Could you talk a little bit more about that?,79,,
676,0.97,5092.187,5120.548,"Yeah, the idea here is that there are sometimes, you know, uses in neighborhood residential zones or, you know, a side street right off of a main neighborhood commercial area, where a Vender might make sense, not everywhere, it won't make sense everywhere, but that we want to have a little of our flexibility to issue these permits, maybe adjacent to a park, where there's like a lot of Soccer tournaments happening, or things like that.",80,,
677,0.97,5120.548,5151.479,"So to be honest, this is a new area for us, and we're working on trying to create some, a framework for review that will work, and again, our whole idea with this approach is to be flexible, and Iterative, so we'll try to have some review criteria that makes sense, and then we can Adaptif we're finding we didn't get it quite right initially.",80,,
678,0.97,5151.479,5151.846,Thank you.,81,,
679,0.97,5151.846,5152.347,Councilmember Morales.,81,,
680,0.97,5152.347,5152.714,Thank you.,82,,
681,0.97,5152.714,5178.239,"So I didn't have a question about this slide, but while we're hear, I appreciate what you're trying to do here, as somebody who was really advocating for us, you know, allowing more food trucks in the city, I think it's important that we support these small businesses, and, you know, they have food truck pods in Portland that are very successful.",82,,
682,0.97,5178.239,5185.346,"And really provide, you know, an array of food options for neighbors, and support these small businesses.",82,,
683,0.97,5185.346,5192.287,So just glad to see that you're trying to figure out what the right answer is there?,82,,
684,0.97,5192.287,5197.725,I actually have a question about slide 13.,82,,
685,0.97,5197.725,5211.839,"As you're talking about Street closures, I'm thinking in particular about the Columbia city patio project that was going for a while during the pandemic, and, you know, fairly successful.",82,,
686,0.97,5211.839,5224.986,"People in the neighborhood really appreciated the opportunity to go to the neighborhood restaurants and bring their food to this covered space, so they could sit outdoors and eat, and it wasn't a space for any particular business.",82,,
687,0.97,5224.986,5226.721,It was for all the surrounding businesses.,82,,
688,0.97,5226.721,5233.094,"And they had a small stage, and you know, there would be evening events.",82,,
689,0.97,5233.094,5236.965,"And I'm not quite sure what happened, but it's gone.",82,,
690,0.97,5236.965,5241.603,And so we're interested in figuring out how we can bring that back.,82,,
691,0.97,5241.603,5257.118,"And on this slide, what I'm trying to understand is the first bullet point says, allow ongoing Street closures with full year options.",82,,
692,0.97,5257.118,5265.693,"And then the third bullet says full year, or seasonal permits will be issued for public events.",82,,
693,0.97,5265.693,5267.428,So are those two different permit types?,82,,
694,0.97,5267.428,5279.374,"Could the Columbia city patio, for example, come back and be permitted year-round if it doesn't have public events going on all the time?",82,,
695,0.97,5279.374,5280.208,A great question.,83,,
696,0.97,5280.208,5290.852,"And we, you know, we are talking to the patio representatives, and are hoping to see that, you know, come back to Columbia city.",83,,
697,0.97,5290.852,5294.522,"But yes, we do think that there's space.",83,,
698,0.97,5294.522,5302.397,"An important space for those types of spaces to come back, via this street closure type.",83,,
699,0.97,5302.397,5304.132,Whether or not there's events happening.,83,,
700,0.97,5304.132,5310.705,"I do think that would be a home for the patio, via our Street permitting process.",83,,
701,0.97,5310.705,5316.144,"And I think, you know, the idea of having it be open for more public seating is really great.",83,,
702,0.97,5316.144,5327.322,"I think it then can support a variety of businesses, you know, on the side street like it is, you know, when they're kind of off a busier arterial street.",83,,
703,0.97,5327.322,5337.598,I think it's a really good model that we'll see perhaps come to other neighborhood business districts too.,83,,
704,0.97,5337.598,5337.965,Thank you.,84,,
705,0.97,5337.965,5339.467,Thank you.,85,,
706,0.97,5339.467,5344.138,"Colleagues, any other comments or questions?",85,,
707,0.97,5344.138,5346.04,"Oh, sure, can't resist, chairman.",86,,
708,0.97,5346.04,5348.443,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Strauss.",87,,
709,0.97,5348.443,5349.243,Real quick.,88,,
710,0.97,5349.243,5354.682,"Councilmember Pedersen, I think your question about the Takeout was spot on.",88,,
711,0.97,5354.682,5364.492,"All the questions that Wrestled with just here in this community so far, we've Wrestled with on Ballard Avenue.",88,,
712,0.97,5364.492,5369.697,A business can take out permit for the space directly in front of their business.,88,,
713,0.97,5369.697,5371.866,They're able to sign up for Sdot.,88,,
714,0.97,5371.866,5380.975,"Same group here, at least Nelson's team set up the three minute pickup for food permit.",88,,
715,0.97,5380.975,5387.882,"Alyse, is that, I know there's places in Ballard we've permitted for that so a Takeout restaurant can have that.",88,,
716,0.97,5387.882,5397.525,"In particular, we have other Coast cafe that's right next to a retail restaurant.",88,,
717,0.97,5397.525,5399.927,"Other coast, or retail merchandise store.",88,,
718,0.97,5399.927,5401.395,Other Coast doesn't have outdoor seating.,88,,
719,0.97,5401.395,5403.097,It's got maybe a couple cheers.,88,,
720,0.97,5403.097,5412.473,"You can eat your sandwich there if you want to, but it's not, there's easier places to eat your sandwich is what I would say.",88,,
721,0.97,5412.473,5425.253,"They're done a nice job with partners with their neighbors, so the space kind of fluctuates, during the farmer's market, the frontage flips so the farmer's market uses that Pergola.",88,,
722,0.97,5425.253,5429.791,What stood out to me was the ability to have that three minute parks.,88,,
723,0.97,5429.791,5432.66,I think it's something restaurants in particular really benefit from.,88,,
724,0.97,5432.66,5439.7,It makes sure nobody is lingering in front of their business.,88,,
725,0.97,5439.7,5440.234,Folks can come in.,88,,
726,0.97,5440.234,5446.674,"Alyse, is that still something businesses are Aable to apply for and use the parking space in front of their business for?",88,,
727,0.97,5446.674,5453.214,"Just to clarify, it's not my team that issues those.",89,,
728,0.97,5453.214,5466.527,"We work with also great, I think we've Transitioned Maybe to a five minute loading zone, and then there's like kind of Standard, you'll see 15 minute pedestrian passenger loading.",89,,
729,0.97,5466.527,5482.944,"So Yeah, I think maybe what I would say, high level is, you know, every curb space application we work closely with their team to really consider the need for loading and access on the block, so we're making sure to get that right.",89,,
730,0.97,5482.944,5483.177,So yes.,89,,
731,0.97,5483.177,5492.086,"Like a five minute loading zone might be a good solution to make sure that businesses have what they need on the block, or maybe it's right around the corner.",89,,
732,0.97,5492.086,5505.099,"We'll work with our current space team and consider how to make sure we're accommodating, like the multiple uses that we must accommodate with the right of way.",89,,
733,0.97,5505.099,5514.809,"Speaking to, I believe it was slide 14, 15.",90,,
734,0.97,5514.809,5515.877,The fees is where we're going.,90,,
735,0.97,5515.877,5528.523,"Understanding that in the past, our fees were so high, and the flexibility for these spaces was so low, it's why we didn't see businesses using this permit.",90,,
736,0.97,5528.523,5540.534,"When I think back to noble fur on Ballard Avenue, they had less space in front of their business than I have sitting at this desk to have a table and chairs.",90,,
737,0.97,5540.534,5550.278,"So just looking, we're sitting at my desk, you would literally have to be up against the wall here, and allow for pedestrian passage.",90,,
738,0.97,5550.278,5551.679,So it was very expensive.,90,,
739,0.97,5551.679,5559.954,So I think that the flexibility that you've created is very important.,90,,
740,0.97,5559.954,5568.062,"In the cost recovery, I know that this section is funded by permits the same as you provide.",90,,
741,0.97,5568.062,5582.276,"This is a pretty common practice in the city, and it makes sure that our general fund isn't being used beyond what we need it to because we've got a lot of different needs for our general fund use.",90,,
742,0.97,5582.276,5587.281,"So that said, I understand our need to have cost recovery here.",90,,
743,0.97,5587.281,5597.425,Understand that we're able to use Federal one time funds to buoy the good work that you're doing by issuing permits for free.,90,,
744,0.97,5597.425,5601.362,I also heard public Commenters today say that we need to make sure these fees are reasonable.,90,,
745,0.97,5601.362,5609.103,I just want today say I agree with both you and public Commenters about the need for these fees.,90,,
746,0.97,5609.103,5611.639,We just need to make sure they're Right-Sized.,90,,
747,0.97,5611.639,5621.282,Because something in the past that we were basing these off of was what was the potential parking revenue for a parking place.,90,,
748,0.97,5621.282,5627.088,That doesn't take into account the time that that parking stall might not be used.,90,,
749,0.97,5627.088,5642.737,"Also in this Iteration now, as we're moving forward into the new era of outdoor dining, we also need to be considering how much general fund tax revenue is created by sales tax by the business activities that are occurring in these spaces.",90,,
750,0.97,5642.737,5649.777,"I also know that within your team, Alyse, we're wrestling with the public private use of these spaces, and what is the public benefit.",90,,
751,0.97,5649.777,5651.679,We'll talk more about that.,90,,
752,0.97,5651.679,5653.481,Happy to chat more about that.,90,,
753,0.97,5653.481,5658.052,But I just wanted to highlight that the fees are not as straight forward as it might seem on its face.,90,,
754,0.97,5658.052,5661.022,We've come a long way.,90,,
755,0.97,5661.022,5670.031,"We need to make sure they're Right-Sized, and there's also that third benefit of sales tax that is coming to our city.",90,,
756,0.97,5670.031,5672.867,That's all I've got for now.,90,,
757,0.97,5672.867,5678.239,"Just thank you, Alyse, Joel, Mike Estey for the parking, the To-Go zones.",90,,
758,0.97,5678.239,5687.014,"With all of these different tools in our tool box, we're really able to create that need, or the right sized fit for each section.",90,,
759,0.97,5687.014,5691.085,"Actually, you know, I had one more thing to ask.",90,,
760,0.97,5691.085,5719.246,"Alyse, when we're doing public feedback on each permit, I know in other aspects of the work that I do for the city, sometimes it's used to delay, whether it's intentional, or Unintentional, or often time, on another set of questions, oftentimes the bureaucracy just becomes a little bit more Grindy, because we're having to create these opportunities for public comment.",90,,
761,0.97,5719.246,5731.559,"Can you share with me how we're going to streamline this, so that we're not making businesses wait through a season that they could be getting business and creating tax revenue?",90,,
762,0.97,5731.559,5744.205,"How are we going to make sure this is properly used to get the input from the neighboring businesses, but also not use it as a way to stop us from moving forward?",90,,
763,0.97,5744.205,5746.307,"Yeah, that's a good question.",91,,
764,0.97,5746.307,5757.418,"I think that one thing is to be businesses, so they know what to expect and kind of take that into consideration when they're making their application to Sdot.",91,,
765,0.97,5757.418,5776.871,"The one thing I would always say is it's always good to have conversations with your neighbors if you are thinking about applying sometime, you can have some really good informal conversations up front, but that might mean Sdot doesn't get a comment letter or Email later if you've worked out it already for us.",91,,
766,0.97,5776.871,5790.284,One thing that's important is to not kind of assume that something that was really successful during the pandemic doesn't need any kind of modifications moving forward.,91,,
767,0.97,5790.284,5799.226,"We want to do the process we always have on these public permits, and making sure we're hearing from folks that now, because it's been a couple of years.",91,,
768,0.97,5799.226,5802.596,"I think really, what we focus on is what do neighbors think?",91,,
769,0.97,5802.596,5809.937,What are we missing that we might not see from reviewing the site conditions and kind of having eyes on the street?,91,,
770,0.97,5809.937,5819.814,"What do they know better than us, as far as that loading truck comes here at this time of day, so we can kind of sort that out.",91,,
771,0.97,5819.814,5828.589,"But really, we're hoping to hear technical concerns from folks so we can add to our review, so we make it even better when that cafe gets approved in the neighborhood.",91,,
772,0.97,5828.589,5828.956,Thank you.,92,,
773,0.97,5828.956,5830.524,"Chair, that's all I've got.",92,,
774,0.97,5830.524,5832.393,Thank you very much.,93,,
775,0.97,5832.393,5834.195,I really appreciate the presentation.,93,,
776,0.97,5834.195,5838.132,And we can follow up with any other questions that we have later.,93,,
777,0.97,5838.132,5847.675,"We'll go ahead and move onto our final item on the agenda, which is a half a billion dollars item on our agenda.",93,,
778,0.97,5847.675,5850.411,The ship Canal water quality control project.,93,,
779,0.97,5850.411,5856.35,"So let's have the clerk read the next item into record, please.",93,,
780,0.97,5856.35,5856.817,Agenda item four.,94,,
781,0.97,5856.817,5860.287,Ship Canal update for briefing and discussion.,94,,
782,0.97,5860.287,5862.656,Thank you.,95,,
783,0.97,5862.656,5866.026,Colleagues you're familiar with this mega project.,95,,
784,0.97,5866.026,5878.205,It's going to improve our environment with the 3-Mile underground solution to store Stormwater until we can get it treated.,95,,
785,0.97,5878.205,5892.553,"We know they've worked through challenges here, so welcome our officially confirmed general manager of Seattle public utilities, and Keith ward, general manager.",95,,
786,0.97,5892.553,5894.922,"Thank you, chair Pedersen and Councilmembers on this Committee.",96,,
787,0.97,5894.922,5902.83,We're about to hear today an update about one of our most important projects that SPD has ever undertaken.,96,,
788,0.97,5902.83,5914.608,"The ship Canal project will prevent an average of 75 million gallons of raw sewage and polluted Stormwater from entering Lake Washington ship Canal, salmon Bay, and Union Bay.",96,,
789,0.97,5914.608,5926.787,"It is actually the centerpiece project in our consent decree, with the environmental defense agency, Department of Ecology, and Department of justice, and will provide public health and public benefits to our city.",96,,
790,0.97,5926.787,5934.795,"As Councilmember Pedersen noted, it's also the most expensive, and most complex capital project that we' V implemented.",96,,
791,0.97,5934.795,5937.464,Not to mention during a period of unprecedented challenges.,96,,
792,0.97,5937.464,5948.275,"I want to thank chair Pedersen and the other Councilmembers on this Committee for the attention that they have placed on this project with the goal of delivering it on schedule, and on budget.",96,,
793,0.97,5948.275,5958.352,"Today, Keith ward, the program executive is here to provide an update on the project, and give a sense of how the challenges of the past two and a half years are effecting the project.",96,,
794,0.97,5958.352,5962.489,"At this point, I'll pass it off to Keith.",96,,
795,0.97,5962.489,5964.191,"Thanks, Andrew.",97,,
796,0.97,5964.191,5968.962,Just make sure.,97,,
797,0.97,5968.962,5971.165,Can you see a full screen?,97,,
798,0.97,5971.165,5971.432,Yes.,98,,
799,0.97,5971.432,5971.932,All right.,99,,
800,0.97,5971.932,5977.204,So thank you for having us on your agenda today for this presentation.,99,,
801,0.97,5977.204,5982.242,"I'll start with the project overview, including our current schedule and construction projects.",99,,
802,0.97,5982.242,5989.483,"Then I'll cover our costs, estimating, and management practices, our budget, and our proposed next steps.",99,,
803,0.97,5989.483,6000.794,The ship Canal water quality project is a storage tunnel to reduce storage flows into water ways.,99,,
804,0.97,6000.794,6006.767,"Seattle, like many areas has areas are sewage combines with water.",99,,
805,0.97,6006.767,6013.474,"During heavy rains, Stormwater fills these pipes causing the system to overflow into local water bodies.",99,,
806,0.97,6013.474,6026.72,"This image shows how once the project is completed, many of our worst Overflows will instead be rerouted into a water tunnel.",99,,
807,0.97,6026.72,6039.433,"The project will keep 75 million gallons of polluted Stormwater and sewage out of salmon Bay, and the ship Canal every year.",99,,
808,0.97,6039.433,6041.835,The city signed with the U.S.,99,,
809,0.97,6041.835,6047.107,Department of justice and the Washington Department of Ecology about these combined sewer Overflows.,99,,
810,0.97,6047.107,6056.95,"The performance requirement is that we must have less than one overflow but year, per Outfall on a 20 year moving average.",99,,
811,0.97,6056.95,6061.021,This applies citywide to all of our 82 Outfall locations.,99,,
812,0.97,6061.021,6068.629,The ship Canal water quality project addresses Overflows at six locations.,99,,
813,0.97,6068.629,6077.538,"Currently, these six Outfalls overflow 104 times per year on average.",99,,
814,0.97,6077.538,6080.274,This is shared project with King County.,99,,
815,0.97,6080.274,6085.712,It will address four of the city's Outfalls and two of the county's Outfalls.,99,,
816,0.97,6085.712,6093.954,The four city Outfalls overflow the vast majority of sewage Overflows annually.,99,,
817,0.97,6093.954,6101.528,"This map shows the county's drainage basins in green, and the city's drainage basins in pink to the six Outfall locations.",99,,
818,0.97,6101.528,6105.032,The cost of this project is shared.,99,,
819,0.97,6105.032,6115.609,"Our joint project agreement with King County includes a cost of about 65% for the city of Seattle, and about 35% for the King County wastewater management division.",99,,
820,0.97,6115.609,6118.812,Now I'm going to talk about project design and construction.,99,,
821,0.97,6118.812,6122.182,This is a planned view of the project.,99,,
822,0.97,6122.182,6126.82,Our work includes construction in the five neighborhoods shown here along the ship canal.,99,,
823,0.97,6126.82,6137.197,The backbone of the project is a 2.7-Mile long 18-Foot 10-Inch diameter storage tunnel from Ballard to Wallingford.,99,,
824,0.97,6137.197,6144.171,"To give you a size of the scale, your standard transit tunnel like sound Transits.",99,,
825,0.97,6144.171,6150.077,We also have two other smaller tunnels shown by number twos and three here.,99,,
826,0.97,6150.077,6155.115,One under the ship Canal from Fremont to Queen Anne and one in Ballard.,99,,
827,0.97,6155.115,6157.851,This is a simplified section of the project.,99,,
828,0.97,6157.851,6162.856,"Each of the five neighborhoods, which I showed earlier, are shown at the top.",99,,
829,0.97,6162.856,6173.2,And the three colors denote how we've packaged work between three construction packages.,99,,
830,0.97,6173.2,6177.671,"Shown at the top, Conveyance pipes from the existing season.",99,,
831,0.97,6177.671,6179.239,These are shown by arrows.,99,,
832,0.97,6179.239,6185.979,These bring flows to drop shafts and the drop shafts take the flows from the surface down into the storage tunnel.,99,,
833,0.97,6185.979,6192.019,The tunnel was shown in dark blue and will be between 57 to 105 feet deep.,99,,
834,0.97,6192.019,6196.79,It will provide about 30 million gallons of storage capacity.,99,,
835,0.97,6196.79,6205.365,"There are only two above ground structures, a small electrical building in wailing Ford, and our pump station in Ballard.",99,,
836,0.97,6205.365,6210.437,The ship quality project is a massive effort that spans 11 years.,99,,
837,0.97,6210.437,6213.974,We have four major construction packages which are shown on the left side.,99,,
838,0.97,6213.974,6217.044,In years are shown across the top.,99,,
839,0.97,6217.044,6225.919,"In late 2018, we removed a fifth construction package, which realized a cost savings of about $10 million.",99,,
840,0.97,6225.919,6233.293,"The different colors are from the bars somehow how we plan and have options analysis, design, and construction phases.",99,,
841,0.97,6233.293,6245.939,"We'll be working on this project through 2025, which is the purple line on the right, and we must have complete construction and be operational by then.",99,,
842,0.97,6245.939,6250.477,The dashed yellow line denotes a keynote in our project.,99,,
843,0.97,6250.477,6261.622,"The pump station cannot begin until the storage project is completed, so we're closely monitoring progress of the storage tunnel.",99,,
844,0.97,6261.622,6265.092,We've made considerable progress in the past seven years.,99,,
845,0.97,6265.092,6268.528,We've completed the designs of all of our projects.,99,,
846,0.97,6268.528,6273.233,We've completed construction on one project and have bids on two more.,99,,
847,0.97,6273.233,6284.645,"Because we have bids for this work, we have more cost certainty on over $270 million of construction work.",99,,
848,0.97,6284.645,6294.988,"We only have one more project to build, which is our $120 million project, which is shown as a light shade of dark blue.",99,,
849,0.97,6294.988,6302.529,"We'll be bidding this project this fall, and expect to know the construction cost by early 2023, which is shown by the yellow Star.",99,,
850,0.97,6302.529,6308.235,We've expended over $256 million on this project so far.,99,,
851,0.97,6308.235,6313.04,This is a photo of our Ballard early works project that was completed in early 2019.,99,,
852,0.97,6313.04,6321.048,It was a $10 million construction package that prepared the Ballard site for tunnel operations.,99,,
853,0.97,6321.048,6330.223,"We've completed this construction package in advance of Tunneling, to secure the Tunneling to get better bid prices.",99,,
854,0.97,6330.223,6338.131,"Shown here is the removal of about it 2,000 tons, or 1,000 truck loads of contaminated soil.",99,,
855,0.97,6338.131,6347.207,"Although we encountered more contaminated soil than expected, we had planned for, and budgeted for possible risk events like this.",99,,
856,0.97,6347.207,6360.053,"Our storage tunnel is an active construction across five neighborhoods, and includes the 2.7-Mile long storage tunnel shown in the center of this slide.",99,,
857,0.97,6360.053,6361.254,"Again, this is the backbone of the project.",99,,
858,0.97,6361.254,6377.27,"This particulate of the project has been featured in the media for the successful tunnel boring machine naming contest where over 34,000 people last year voted and Mudhoney was selected as the name of our tunnel boring machine.",99,,
859,0.97,6377.27,6389.649,"Also featured was Mudhoney's defeat of a boulder earlier this spring, affectionately called mega bolder.",99,,
860,0.97,6389.649,6394.221,We selected our storage Handler in 2019.,99,,
861,0.97,6394.221,6404.531,"They've completed about 25% of the storage tunnel, and our five neighborhood sets.",99,,
862,0.97,6404.531,6408.101,"Two of our construction projects are not yet in, or through construction.",99,,
863,0.97,6408.101,6413.573,On the right is a a map showing construction of our construction package.,99,,
864,0.97,6413.573,6423.65,"In the past month, we've received construction bids for this $8.7 million project, and they came in under budget.",99,,
865,0.97,6423.65,6426.92,On the left is a rendering of our pump station.,99,,
866,0.97,6426.92,6436.93,"It is our biggest remaining uncertainty, and is expected to bid this fall as I said.",99,,
867,0.97,6436.93,6440.167,I'll talk more about this later.,99,,
868,0.97,6440.167,6443.603,"Now I'm shifting to talk about cost management, and budgets.",99,,
869,0.97,6443.603,6454.381,"On a large project like the ship Canal water quality project estimating and managing costs is very important, and including strategies to manage changes, uncertainties, and risks.",99,,
870,0.97,6454.381,6459.853,"There's a lot of terminology in cost estimating, but I wanted to highlight four key factors.",99,,
871,0.97,6459.853,6460.754,The first is base cost.,99,,
872,0.97,6460.754,6466.159,This is what most people think about when they talk about design and construction.,99,,
873,0.97,6466.159,6470.497,"It includes the construction costs such as concrete, Rebar, and skilled labor.",99,,
874,0.97,6470.497,6475.702,It also includes I think Fleering and support services.,99,,
875,0.97,6475.702,6483.443,"To find base cost, we look across all of our projects for base costs in the year that we're preparing our estimate.",99,,
876,0.97,6483.443,6483.944,Second is escalation.,99,,
877,0.97,6483.944,6491.218,This is what it will cost to complete the project in the future.,99,,
878,0.97,6491.218,6496.022,"We didn't buy steel, Desill, and other materials in 2018 in the last budget.",99,,
879,0.97,6496.022,6503.497,We will buy those materials and hire the contract construction labor for that project in 2023.,99,,
880,0.97,6503.497,6508.201,We have to estimate what escalation will be through time to approve our budget.,99,,
881,0.97,6508.201,6516.543,Our $570 million budget included $60 million in escalation.,99,,
882,0.97,6516.543,6518.044,"In an estimate, there is always uncertainty.",99,,
883,0.97,6518.044,6523.817,We can't know everything about the design or how escalation will really impact the work.,99,,
884,0.97,6523.817,6525.986,We incorporate uncertainty into the cost estimates.,99,,
885,0.97,6525.986,6532.826,"As we have more design definition, then the bids from the contractors uncertainty decreases.",99,,
886,0.97,6532.826,6537.264,Shown on the left is what is called the cone of uncertainty.,99,,
887,0.97,6537.264,6550.443,"It conveys how uncertainty decreases as there is a higher degree of design development as you move to the right in this figure, and finally when construction bids are received from our contractors.",99,,
888,0.97,6550.443,6554.414,"Lastly, construction projects have risks.",99,,
889,0.97,6554.414,6558.485,"If these risks happen, they impact costs and schedule.",99,,
890,0.97,6558.485,6563.723,We plan for risks and integrate risk reserves into our project cost estimates and schedules.,99,,
891,0.97,6563.723,6573.033,"An example of a risk event that has occurred is the Megaboulder we encountered several months ago, which is shown on the front of the tunnel boring machine on the right.",99,,
892,0.97,6573.033,6580.807,We had a risk event for boulders in our risk register and are currently evaluating if the impact is as we had predicted.,99,,
893,0.97,6580.807,6593.52,"It is important to remember there are cost estimates, don't include a Singl estimate, but a range of possible outcomes, based on various uncertainty, and risk scenario us.",99,,
894,0.97,6593.52,6602.295,This type of estimating is best practiced by other agencies like the Washington Department of transportation and sound transit.,99,,
895,0.97,6602.295,6606.399,So how do large projects manage for uncertainty and risk?,99,,
896,0.97,6606.399,6610.77,They use risk registers as I said we've used these.,99,,
897,0.97,6610.77,6622.415,"Working with subject matter experts in many fields including Tunneling, we identify, analyze, and monitor risks that could impact the project.",99,,
898,0.97,6622.415,6626.786,In some cases we decrease the impact of occurring.,99,,
899,0.97,6626.786,6632.959,The second is uncertain Itty and risk modeling.,99,,
900,0.97,6632.959,6646.84,"In the end, we can develop a range of budget and core responding uncertainties to better understand the confidence to deliver the project at a specific budget.",99,,
901,0.97,6646.84,6665.558,"Lastly, we utilize contingency funds and reserves to utilize events when they occur and--shown here are some cost management best practices wire doing on the ship Canal water project to Proactively try to stay within our project budget.",99,,
902,0.97,6665.558,6673.6,"Monthly our project teams and our management review Stokes, schedules, and costs for each of our projects in the overall project.",99,,
903,0.97,6673.6,6683.076,We also review our risk registers which include over 400 risk events and evaluate our budget confidence to deliver the project within our $570 million budget.,99,,
904,0.97,6683.076,6698.058,"Next I want to talk about the last three which are shown, the last three strategies which have been key cost reduction strategies for this project.",99,,
905,0.97,6698.058,6709.469,So past practices and cost management including finding over $67 million through cost reductions through three major efforts in the last seven years.,99,,
906,0.97,6709.469,6722.716,Our latest cost reduction effort in 2020 reduced costs by $7 million by changing the exterior of our pump station and changing how soil would be removed from construction of the storage tunnel.,99,,
907,0.97,6722.716,6730.724,We also have secured $342 million in low interest rate Federal and state loans which will save rate payers $99 million.,99,,
908,0.97,6730.724,6734.594,Council recently approved the last of our state loans.,99,,
909,0.97,6734.594,6746.372,"Looking forward, we will continue our review of our Stokes, schedules, and costs, as well as risk registers and other cost management.",99,,
910,0.97,6746.372,6750.176,We'll also work to manage construction to contain costs.,99,,
911,0.97,6750.176,6759.986,And we're evaluating the use of commodity escalation risk sharing on our remaining construction package that we'll be preparing soon.,99,,
912,0.97,6759.986,6766.793,This will help attract the best contractors for this complex construction package.,99,,
913,0.97,6766.793,6771.297,Here I'm going to move into talking about the project's budget.,99,,
914,0.97,6771.297,6774.567,"As I do, please remember two things.",99,,
915,0.97,6774.567,6775.201,First this is a joint project.,99,,
916,0.97,6775.201,6783.476,"About 65% of the costs are the cities, and the remainder are King County's.",99,,
917,0.97,6783.476,6786.746,The city's contribution currently is $395 million.,99,,
918,0.97,6786.746,6789.916,Over the $570 million budget.,99,,
919,0.97,6789.916,6791.784,Also I'll be talking about confidence.,99,,
920,0.97,6791.784,6800.026,Confidence is how we convey how certain we are that a project will be at or below a forecasted amount.,99,,
921,0.97,6800.026,6804.497,"We strive to anticipate trends and manage risks, but these factors vary through time.",99,,
922,0.97,6804.497,6814.874,Shown here is a chronology of a few key budget items.,99,,
923,0.97,6814.874,6823.283,"Councilmember Herbold was the chair of our committee when we developed this budget, due to changes in historical rainfall and an increase in construction market conditions.",99,,
924,0.97,6823.283,6835.395,"I was also brought Onboard at that time and in order to develop this budget, we initiated an extensive 10 month long cost estimate review, and reconciliation process.",99,,
925,0.97,6835.395,6851.878,"We worked with national experts and we evaluated all the key factors for the project and worked with the Mayor and city Council to set the budget at $570 million, and a 65% confidence.",99,,
926,0.97,6851.878,6864.858,"A 65% confidence means that there's a 65% chance that the project will be brought in at or below the estimated cost, and a 35% chance that the estimated cost will be exceeded.",99,,
927,0.97,6864.858,6872.398,"Again, included in this estimate was an estimate of about $60 million in escalation.",99,,
928,0.97,6872.398,6876.769,"Since 2018, we've been managing costs, risks, and implementing cost reductions, as I said.",99,,
929,0.97,6876.769,6883.776,But we have experience the some risk events and still some significant risk events present our present in the project.,99,,
930,0.97,6883.776,6894.02,We're going to talk more about what we're seeing in a comprehensive cost reconciliation effort we'll be conducting for the remainder of this year.,99,,
931,0.97,6894.02,6899.592,This will remain Similarto our project in 2017 and 2018.,99,,
932,0.97,6899.592,6908.868,"Shown here is a status of our major risks, costs, and schedule.",99,,
933,0.97,6908.868,6912.372,For risks last summer we presented several bidding construction and risks.,99,,
934,0.97,6912.372,6914.307,I want to highlight two of these risks.,99,,
935,0.97,6914.307,6919.846,The first is that we have a lot of water remaining on the project.,99,,
936,0.97,6919.846,6922.048,We continue to manage this risk.,99,,
937,0.97,6922.048,6931.624,"We have encountered some underground issues, such as the mega boulder this past spring.",99,,
938,0.97,6931.624,6941.234,"However, we have three more years of underground work on the project, including completion of our storage tunnel and our two Conveyance tunnels under the ship Canal and in Ballard.",99,,
939,0.97,6941.234,6948.107,"The second risk event is related to escalation, and has changed considerably in the past nine months.",99,,
940,0.97,6948.107,6955.281,It threatens our ability to bring the project in at or below our current budget.,99,,
941,0.97,6955.281,6962.055,I'll expand on this risk more in the following slides.,99,,
942,0.97,6962.055,6966.559,Or costs our confidence to deliver the budget is at 65%.,99,,
943,0.97,6966.559,6969.295,It is within 5% of our 2018 estimate.,99,,
944,0.97,6969.295,6979.572,"For schedule, we're currently estimated to complete the project in September of 2025, four months ahead of our regulatory completion milestone.",99,,
945,0.97,6979.572,6995.254,"We have experienced some delays in Tunneling, and the estimated of our project duration has increased, so wire looking for ways to mitigate these impacts.",99,,
946,0.97,6995.254,7000.626,We set our budget in 2018.,99,,
947,0.97,7000.626,7002.929,Two of our projects we're still estimating.,99,,
948,0.97,7002.929,7004.097,The other projects.,99,,
949,0.97,7004.097,7005.865,Reporter: were in design phase.,100,,
950,0.97,7005.865,7010.236,We have not started on any of the project as is you can see here.,100,,
951,0.97,7010.236,7017.343,"Since 2018, we have advanced the project considerably, and have more cost certainty in many areas.",100,,
952,0.97,7017.343,7028.254,I want to talk more about escalation shown here is escalation data from several local and national sources from 2008 to early 2022.,100,,
953,0.97,7028.254,7032.658,It shows the percent annual change from the previous year.,100,,
954,0.97,7032.658,7040.933,"This data is specifically related to construction work and it includes construction labor, materials, and equipment.",100,,
955,0.97,7040.933,7050.843,"You see that in general between 2008 and 2021, the change in escalation vary between negative 1% and about 5% annually.",100,,
956,0.97,7050.843,7065.425,"The highest annual rate changes up until 2021 to 2022 were due to Federal infrastructure funding during the great recession, and another local building boom in 2017 to 2019.",100,,
957,0.97,7065.425,7072.331,You may recall that Seattle had the most number of tower cranes in the nation during this latter period.,100,,
958,0.97,7072.331,7077.336,This is also when we developed our budget for $570 million.,100,,
959,0.97,7077.336,7095.755,You can also see that the escalation rate changed from 2021 to 2022 on the right for these indices has been unprecedented at between 15 to 21%.,100,,
960,0.97,7095.755,7104.831,"This figure shows what happens with escalation, since we set our $570 million budget in 2018.",100,,
961,0.97,7104.831,7107.6,Shown here is the annual escalation rate overtime.,100,,
962,0.97,7107.6,7113.639,"It represents the blended escalation rate for labor, materials and equipment on local construction projects.",100,,
963,0.97,7113.639,7125.418,"In 2017 and 2018 when we were developing our project budget, escalation was running above the historical average in Puget sound, which is denoted by the dashed yellow line.",100,,
964,0.97,7125.418,7147.073,"We estimated it would take five years for escalation to return to the historical average, and the blue line shows the estimate which was included, or the annual rate change included in our estimate of $68 million for Excollision.",100,,
965,0.97,7147.073,7156.349,Realized annual escalation was moving back toward the Hi historical average.,100,,
966,0.97,7156.349,7158.885,This is denoted by the solid line.,100,,
967,0.97,7158.885,7170.029,"You can see due to shortages and construction labor, supply chain issues and increased commodity prices.",100,,
968,0.97,7170.029,7180.106,"Projected to be well above the historical average, with 2022 estimated to be at almost 14%.",100,,
969,0.97,7180.106,7192.051,"Escalation compounds overtime, and shown here is the cumulative impact of escalation overnight since 2018.",100,,
970,0.97,7192.051,7197.823,"With our 2018 estimate in blue, and the Futurrized estimate in red.",100,,
971,0.97,7197.823,7202.562,"We will be conveying our project soon, which is shown by the purple arrow.",100,,
972,0.97,7202.562,7211.804,"Contractors will be completing the work between Mid-2023, and through 2025.",100,,
973,0.97,7211.804,7226.485,"We received bids for our $255 million storage tunnel construction project in Mid- 2019, which is shown here before escalation rates increased, so there's no risk of price increases for this construction package.",100,,
974,0.97,7226.485,7231.157,Our next steps include continuing to move the project forward through construction activities.,100,,
975,0.97,7231.157,7248.975,"As I mentioned earlier, we will be conducting a comprehensive and Time-Intensive evaluation and analysis of all of or project costs including reevaluating all of our costs and remaining schedule.",100,,
976,0.97,7248.975,7253.412,"Evaluating risks and uncertainties, looking for continued opportunities.",100,,
977,0.97,7253.412,7258.651,"Further evaluating the impact of Exclogs, and updating our uncertainty and risk model.",100,,
978,0.97,7258.651,7266.025,Some of these are special to a mega project and are not typical of what we do on our remaining projects.,100,,
979,0.97,7266.025,7275.034,"We will also remain in early first quarter, 2023, so we'll have more certainty on the cost of our last project to go under construction, and the impact of escalation.",100,,
980,0.97,7275.034,7285.945,We would like to provide a full budget and schedule update to Council in the second quarter of 2023.,100,,
981,0.97,7285.945,7289.582,And if there's any questions.,100,,
982,0.97,7289.582,7290.483,Thank you very much.,101,,
983,0.97,7290.483,7306.165,"We're very impressed with the progress thus far on this mega project, and really appreciate your noting the cost management that you're doing along the way with this project, that you're not just letting the project unfold.",101,,
984,0.97,7306.165,7309.769,But you did value engineering along the way.,101,,
985,0.97,7309.769,7314.173,You refinanced some of the debt to save money.,101,,
986,0.97,7314.173,7320.513,"Meanwhile, we're going to be battling inflation, inflationary costs over the next 12 months at least.",101,,
987,0.97,7320.513,7322.448,We will certainly have you back.,101,,
988,0.97,7322.448,7328.788,"We do want this project to come in on time, and under budget.",101,,
989,0.97,7328.788,7339.165,"We, of course have a separate formal watch list process as the city Council, thanks to the Councilmembers who set up that process list.",101,,
990,0.97,7339.165,7343.502,"And of course this project is on the watch list, just to monitor.",101,,
991,0.97,7343.502,7350.876,"So we'll have you back here, in addition to being a part of the formal watch list process.",101,,
992,0.97,7350.876,7354.98,"Colleagues, any comments or questions today?",101,,
993,0.97,7354.98,7355.314,Chairman.,102,,
994,0.97,7355.314,7356.882,"Yes, Councilmember Strauss.",103,,
995,0.97,7356.882,7367.293,I'll be brief and just say that I know there are many people in my community that have a lot of challenges with the way that the city does business.,104,,
996,0.97,7367.293,7376.202,"Even for these folks that have many challenges across our city, they say only good things about you, Keith.",104,,
997,0.97,7376.202,7386.011,"That's because of your intention and regular communication and your ability to work with people and make adjustments as needed, and keep the project moving forward, so I just want to thank you there.",104,,
998,0.97,7386.011,7396.188,"I know that one accident is too many, and I'll just state that your record is better than pure projects you've kept a very safe workplace.",104,,
999,0.97,7396.188,7399.258,I did want to just check in to see how Travis is doing.,104,,
1000,0.97,7399.258,7403.529,I know that he was injured earlier this year.,104,,
1001,0.97,7403.529,7406.232,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,105,,
1002,0.97,7406.232,7415.741,"Yeah, Travis is a worker in the tunnel and he actually was injured on March 30th.",106,,
1003,0.97,7415.741,7417.943,A very serious injury.,106,,
1004,0.97,7417.943,7422.148,"Broken hip, and some broken ribs, and we've been monitoring his progress closely.",106,,
1005,0.97,7422.148,7426.786,"He is, I believe, just about ready to return to work.",106,,
1006,0.97,7426.786,7431.457,And so we've been really looking out for him.,106,,
1007,0.97,7431.457,7433.092,I talk about cost and schedule.,106,,
1008,0.97,7433.092,7434.36,Of course those are very important.,106,,
1009,0.97,7434.36,7436.462,Safety is the most important thing for us.,106,,
1010,0.97,7436.462,7438.197,This is very dangerous work.,106,,
1011,0.97,7438.197,7445.738,"We have crews working 24 hours a day, in three shifts, down in the tunnel.",106,,
1012,0.97,7445.738,7454.78,"So safety is one of the most important things, and we're monitoring that, and working on that very closely with our contractors.",106,,
1013,0.97,7454.78,7456.115,Thanks for asking.,106,,
1014,0.97,7456.115,7456.615,"Thank you, Keith.",107,,
1015,0.97,7456.615,7467.626,"Just for the record, I have spoken with people who have completed Pier projects and they've been surprised at how few accidents you've had.",107,,
1016,0.97,7467.626,7469.929,Just highlighting that.,107,,
1017,0.97,7469.929,7485.978,"Just putting on the record always my desire as we return this space into a public place, with the pump station going out to bid soon, just want to reiterate the access for the water way to hand launched crafts.",107,,
1018,0.97,7485.978,7491.851,"Great, you can see actually on this rendering, that is part of the pump station plant.",108,,
1019,0.97,7491.851,7493.619,There we are.,109,,
1020,0.97,7493.619,7497.423,"While I'm not a Paddleboarder, I still love them.",109,,
1021,0.97,7497.423,7497.79,"Thanks, Keith.",109,,
1022,0.97,7497.79,7499.358,"Thank you, colleagues.",110,,
1023,0.97,7499.358,7503.295,Any other final comments or questions before we wrap this up?,110,,
1024,0.97,7503.295,7511.17,"All right, well thank you general manager Lee, and project manager ward for your thorough presentation today.",110,,
1025,0.97,7511.17,7518.043,It's a real resource for the community to have the Powerpoint and see all the hard work you're doing here.,110,,
1026,0.97,7518.043,7524.85,"With that, colleagues, with no further comments and questions, I'll go ahead and adjourn the meeting.",110,,
1027,0.97,7524.85,7526.252,"Thank you, chair.",111,,
1028,0.97,7526.252,7528.187,"Okay, it's 11:37 A.M.",112,,
1029,0.97,7528.187,7534.793,"This concludes the July 19, 2022 meeting of the Seattle public utilities committee.",112,,
1030,0.97,7534.793,7541.8,"We anticipate our next meeting will be on Tuesday, August 2ND.",112,,
1031,0.97,7541.8,7542.501,"Thank you, and we are adjourned.",112,,
