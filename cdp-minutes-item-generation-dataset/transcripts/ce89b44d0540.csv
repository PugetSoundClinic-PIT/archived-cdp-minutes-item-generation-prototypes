119,0.97,824.19,825.391,Good morning colleagues.,24,,

123,0.97,838.604,839.972,The committee agenda has six items.,24,,
124,0.97,839.972,843.876,Three appointments to the pedestrian advisory board.,24,,
125,0.97,843.876,854.62,"Approval of a low interest loan is already planned, to finance $66 million of the $570 million ship Canal water quality control project.",24,,
126,0.97,854.62,859.692,This is a Megaproject planned over many years.,24,,
127,0.97,859.692,866.632,Due to the state and Federal governments requiring the city and county governments to prevent harmful Stormwater and wastewater from Polluting our local waterways.,24,,
128,0.97,866.632,874.506,This Environmental protection project includes a new tunnel boring machine creating a 2.7 mile storm water storage tunnel from Wallingford to Ballard.,24,,
129,0.97,874.506,882.448,Our committee will also discuss the strategic plan for Seattle city light.,24,,
130,0.97,882.448,896.495,"Is a multiyear plan for implementing the mission of this one billion-dollar city owned utility enterprise, which provides affordable, reliable, and environmentally responsible electricity to over 900,000 people in Seattle and surrounding areas.",24,,
131,0.97,896.495,905.437,"I'm pleased that despite several cost pressures such as Covid, Seattle city light has surpassed expectations in keeping their rate increases under control.",24,,
132,0.97,905.437,908.54,City light succeeded in not increasing the bills of electricity customers this year.,24,,
133,0.97,908.54,915.547,While also lowering future rate increases when compared to the previous strategic plan.,24,,
134,0.97,915.547,922.888,"The net result is the six year average increase will be less than 3.5%, instead of the original 4.5% that was planned.",24,,
135,0.97,922.888,931.397,"In other words, the rates will rise as closely as possible to the rate of inflation, which is fiscally responsible and reasonable.",24,,
136,0.97,931.397,937.369,"Not surprisingly, the customer review panel has endorsed the plan, and supports its adoption by the Council.",24,,
137,0.97,937.369,942.007,It's just our first hearing of this at committee this Wednesday.,24,,
138,0.97,942.007,951.517,The Ceo of sound transit and his team will be presenting to our committee this Wednesday on their so-called realignment process.,24,,
139,0.97,951.517,955.187,This vital regional transit agency is considering it for its new projects.,24,,
140,0.97,955.187,965.097,"As you know, the sound transit board has 18 Membes, and while only two of them are from our city government, our Mayor and city Councilmember Juarez are tireless advocates.",24,,
141,0.97,965.097,974.039,I want to thank them for help make possible sound transit's vision.,24,,
142,0.97,974.039,986.418,I share the stands of many others that sound transit board should delay any drastic decisions on realignment until the rapidly changing revenues and cost become more clear.,24,,
143,0.97,986.418,997.863,"I know this city Council and its residents and businesses are big supporters of transit, as evidenced most recently by our renewal of the Seattle transportation benefit district last year despite the economic recession.",24,,
144,0.97,997.863,1006.338,"We are also excited about the opening this October of three new light rail stations in Seattle, founded by the sound transit two measure approved by voters in 2008.",24,,
145,0.97,1006.338,1012.177,The ambitious next steps are implementation of sound transit three expansion approved by the region's voters in 2016.,24,,
146,0.97,1012.177,1019.585,Seattle voters were instrumental in making cost the possible for sound transit three.,24,,
147,0.97,1019.585,1024.189,We want to make sure it delivers on its promises for Seattle.,24,,
148,0.97,1024.189,1030.696,"This includes light rail stations to West Seattle which will impact port of Seattle, stations to Ballard which will impact Union and Seattle center.",24,,
149,0.97,1030.696,1038.971,Additional station for South Seattle as well as northeast 130Th Street and connections important to the entire region that will go through the International district.,24,,
150,0.97,1038.971,1046.945,We are pleased that sound transit accepted the invitation to brief our Committee on the realignment situation.,24,,
151,0.97,1046.945,1055.087,I believe we will have several questions about the financial assumptions sound transit has been relying on to make the realignment recommendations to the board.,24,,
152,0.97,1055.087,1063.395,"In addition to the presentation this Wednesday on realignment, we hope sound transit returns to our Committee later to update us on the environmental impact statement process.",24,,
153,0.97,1063.395,1082.548,During--or discussing that is an important platform to raise other issues important to us such as the need for thoughtful community driven and Stakeholder input to ensure excellent access to stations and integration in our communities.,24,,
154,0.97,1082.548,1093.659,"That can deliver a positive experience for transit riders as we encourage more people to move out of their gasoline fueled cars, to carbon friendly transit as much as possible to meet our ambitious goals to address the crisis of climate change.",24,,
155,0.97,1093.659,1102.267,"Regarding transportation funding, I know we all have a lot of interest in seeing whether more funding will come from our Federal Government.",24,,
156,0.97,1102.267,1113.779,"The transportation funds from the American rescue plan act, Arpa, signed into law in March will go mainly to back the losses suffered by transit agencies, and that Backfield funding is welcomed and vital.",24,,
157,0.97,1113.779,1119.084,I know we are also hoping for more money for new infrastructure projects.,24,,
158,0.97,1119.084,1127.659,"After combining recent media reports with the all on the ground Intel from our Federal lobbyists in DC, what's clear is that the picture from the Federal Government is murky.",24,,
159,0.97,1127.659,1134.8,"This is because the Federal Government has already outweighed record-breaking sums of money, and the politics of become more fluid on infrastructure dollars, especially in the U.S. Senate.",24,,
160,0.97,1134.8,1148.614,If Congress and the President ultimately agree on infrastructure legislation this year is likely to produce much fewer dollars than what President Biden originally called for to address our infrastructure needs.,24,,
161,0.97,1148.614,1162.995,"There are lots of moving pieces and infrastructure bills, reauthorization of five-year surface transportation act, which expires September 30th, then there is the whole budget process which will probably require budget reconciliation to avoid the 60 votes required in the Senate.",24,,

184,0.97,1258.223,1268.634,"In addition to Eviction prevention laws, we also need to address the serious impact of rent increases that have become Unaffordable to most Renters.",26,,
185,0.97,1268.634,1284.249,"Especially if you use the rule of thumb that economists use, which is if as a household you are paying any more than 25 to 30% of your overall income on housing, then you are in--your rent for and need affordable housing.",26,,
186,0.97,1284.249,1293.625,"Obviously the city and the state both need rent control, a strong rent control project, free of corporate loopholes.",26,,

195,0.97,1376.241,1393.325,We should keep in mind that this is also a follow-up of the bill that was passed by the city council from my office to divest the city of Seattle from banks like Wells Fargo.,26,,
196,0.97,1393.325,1427.859,"It's also related to a dire statistic that was recently reported by the Guardian newspaper, which shows that despite all the information on the perils of climate crisis and the impending climate catastrophe, during the pandemic year when usage of fossil fuel intense resources were reduced dramatically, during that same year, the world's largest banks actually increased their underwriting of fossil fuel project by nearly $4 trillion.",26,,

210,0.97,1536.701,1551.082,"Essentially Seattle does not have the power to Legalize these drugs because it's not a city law that makes them illegal, but the city does have the power to essentially Decriminalize them by making their enforcement, the last priority of the Seattle police.",26,,
