27,0.97,194.027,194.394,Good morning.,4,,
28,0.97,194.394,201.134,"I am here to talk about Seattle traffic, the good and the bad.",4,,
29,0.97,201.134,201.935,There is some good.,4,,
30,0.97,201.935,209.442,The first part is transit Ridership is up and single occupancy vehicles are down in the city center.,4,,
31,0.97,209.442,212.278,The other side of the coin is traffic and congestion is still growing.,4,,
32,0.97,212.278,212.679,Why is that?,4,,
33,0.97,212.679,226.092,"The reason is we are not accounting for all forms of traffic especially the fastest growing, that would be trucks and Tmc's which are the right Hailing services, Uber and Lyft.",4,,
34,0.97,226.092,244.177,"Consider these facts I got from the city with regard to Tmc's in zip code 98104 and 98101 we get 17,500 riders a day . that is a lot of cars.",4,,
35,0.97,244.177,246.079,"These cars are not parking anywhere, they are constantly circling.",4,,
36,0.97,246.079,255.188,That means that they have more vehicle miles traveled than a single occupancy vehicle.,4,,
37,0.97,255.188,258.825,2.8 four TNC.,4,,
38,0.97,258.825,261.394,We have to consider these.,4,,
39,0.97,261.394,263.496,These are not in the COMP plan.,4,,
40,0.97,263.496,270.637,"Likewise, trucks are growing 20% annually downtown because of the rise of E-Commerce.",4,,
41,0.97,270.637,279.746,"The Uw did a Cornets study that shows 40s 40,000 trucks coming into the city center every day.",4,,
42,0.97,279.746,283.549,When you look at the annual growth that will be overwhelming in a short while.,4,,
43,0.97,283.549,296.362,"At the same time we are taking away curb lanes and putting an end to bike and bus lanes, which is good, but the new buildings do not come equipped with workable loading births.",4,,
44,0.97,296.362,304.137,The determination was made that new towers that are going to hold 1000 people each don't require a loading births.,4,,
45,0.97,304.137,311.844,"You think about everybody getting their goods and services from E-Commerce, it is going to quickly become a problem if we do not take charge of this.",4,,
46,0.97,311.844,313.68,I would like the committee to do two things.,4,,
47,0.97,313.68,329.896,Last may I submitted an amendment proposal to the plan asking that trucks and TNC be added to the mode share so we can count them . I do not know where that has gone it was supposed to take place this last year.,4,,
48,0.97,329.896,330.063,--,4,,
49,0.97,330.063,333.166,Thank you Ms. Cruz.,5,,

51,0.97,339.005,344.343,Is anybody else signed up to speak?,5,,
52,0.97,344.343,344.544,Okay.,5,,
53,0.97,344.544,353.986,"Seeing we have no additional speakers signed up, the public comment period is closed and we will move to the first item on the agenda.",5,,
54,0.97,353.986,364.363,"We will have our clerk, just an overview of today's committee we have four items on the agenda today.",5,,
55,0.97,364.363,368.101,We will go to the first item now if the clerk will read that into the record for us.,5,,
56,0.97,368.101,387.153,Resolution 31932. & GT; & GT; & GT; a resolution relating to the city light Department; acknowledging and approving city light's adoption of a biennial energy conservation target for 2020- 2021 and ten-year conservation potential.,6,,
57,0.97,387.153,391.457,Thank you.,7,,
58,0.97,391.457,393.059,We will be hearing this item twice.,7,,
59,0.97,393.059,399.966,There is a public hearing that will be required.,7,,
60,0.97,399.966,401.634,We will be back for that official public hearing.,7,,
61,0.97,401.634,405.371,"I actually spoke with the general manager and Ceo, Debra Smith, who is joining us.",7,,
62,0.97,405.371,414.046,She has offered to give a brief update about what we read about in the Seattle times and other media outlets about the copper wire theft.,7,,
63,0.97,414.046,422.588,Why don't we do introductions and then we can hear from you.,7,,
64,0.97,422.588,425.358,I am Debra Smith the general manager of Seattle city light.,8,,
65,0.97,425.358,430.062,I am Craig Smith director of customer care and solutions at Seattle city light.,9,,
66,0.97,430.062,437.77,I am Jennifer Finnigan at customer care and solutions at Seattle city light.,10,,
67,0.97,437.77,440.606,I think that is the first time I have heard that.,11,,
68,0.97,440.606,451.751,"As a quick aside, I think this is a good thing for our community . In my year and a half we have been doing some reorganization.",11,,
69,0.97,451.751,459.192,"One of the things that we have done is taken the customer care group, it is not operational customer service, it is not the billing and collections.",11,,
70,0.97,459.192,468.034,"Those are in the operation group under Mike Haynes leadership, he is our Coo and he is right there.",11,,
71,0.97,468.034,482.014,Craig is reporting directly to me and he has been responsible for customer energy solutions which is energy efficiency and most of our value add products and services.,11,,
72,0.97,482.014,492.158,We brought those together and it is really--we are discovering it is a great marriage.,11,,
73,0.97,492.158,493.259,There is a lot of similarities.,11,,
74,0.97,493.259,503.169,These are folks that have years of experience being in our customers homes and working with them directly.,11,,
75,0.97,503.169,506.973,Their knowledge about the customer experience and what it takes to manage and sustain long-term relationships is really deep.,11,,
76,0.97,506.973,515.548,Taking customer care which includes the program and key accounts and bringing those folks together is great.,11,,
77,0.97,515.548,521.254,"That is the first time I have heard anyone use the name of the new division, it kind of rolled off your tongues.",11,,
78,0.97,521.254,521.854,You did awesome.,11,,
79,0.97,521.854,549.382,"I will take a quick minute, first of all, we really appreciate the article in the times, the reporter did a great job and we worked with him for a long period of time to make sure that the information was presented and we appreciate Councilmember Herbold for bringing this up and a lot of work has been done since then.",11,,
80,0.97,549.382,562.895,Actually staff completed a great report on Street light copper wire theft analysis report that I got a copy of yesterday it was finalized at the end of January.,11,,
81,0.97,562.895,572.438,"It is a great review of the problem, what other utilities are doing, how it is Impacting Seattle and best practices.",11,,
82,0.97,572.438,576.242,I wanted to share a bit of information.,11,,
83,0.97,576.242,584.383,One of the things we have done is provide a set of recommendations these are on the ground staff level and not consultants.,11,,
84,0.97,584.383,590.556,These are folks dealing with this on a daily basis.,11,,
85,0.97,590.556,595.361,"Number one, which is huge, is develop and launch a public awareness campaign on how to spot a theft in progress and how to report.",11,,
86,0.97,595.361,616.749,"We know that it is happening and that is one of the things that the times did a great job of talking about, the lengths to which folks are going in some cases to do the work during the day and then pull the wire at night.",11,,
87,0.97,616.749,629.495,A part of that is to develop expectations for contractors who are performing work in the public Right-Of-Way or in the streets so that folks in the community can identify these are folks who are doing work who are either city light employees or are doing work on our behalf.,11,,
88,0.97,629.495,637.403,That will be part of the public campaign and then working with those folks.,11,,
89,0.97,637.403,641.107,Undertaking a Cost-Benefit analysis for the replacement of copper wire with aluminum.,11,,
90,0.97,641.107,642.908,I have no idea how that will turn out.,11,,
91,0.97,642.908,651.384,"We do know the market is very different for those and we will be looking at, as we are doing a better job, thank you Councilmember for capturing the cost.",11,,
92,0.97,651.384,664.03,We have a separate work order is costing us . stand what this this was mentioned in the story looking at welding Handholds.,11,,
93,0.97,664.03,668.534,"That is a pretty practical solution, one that we are starting to do.",11,,
94,0.97,668.534,685.017,"The downside again was discussed, when there is a legitimate outage it does take a longer duration.",11,,
95,0.97,685.017,687.453,But in the long run it is the right way to go.,11,,
96,0.97,687.453,693.359,If that is what we do we will have to develop a construction standard so we have that and then it will take time to work through the system.,11,,
97,0.97,693.359,701.834,We are looking at staffing and language to manage copper wire theft related activities such as data entry into our system where we keep track of things.,11,,
98,0.97,701.834,705.371,I appreciate that there was support in general as we learn more and get our program together.,11,,
99,0.97,705.371,709.141,If there are budget impacts we will be talking to you.,11,,
100,0.97,709.141,713.379,We are assuming that there is a lot that we can do with the existing resources and make that work.,11,,
101,0.97,713.379,718.084,"Lastly, we are not the only community to have this problem.",11,,
102,0.97,718.084,727.426,"There are a lot of emerging solutions and that's what I refer to as best practice, we are exploring other solutions.",11,,
103,0.97,727.426,741.107,We are committed to providing an update to the Mayor this week and I mentioned Councilmember Pedersen as soon as we have that complete we will get that to you as well so that will give you information current from the date of the article.,11,,
104,0.97,741.107,759.925,"This is a place where the public's help and involvement is we do not want people to do something that will put them in Harms way, we will be educating folks on how to respond if they see activities that they think are suspicious.",11,,
105,0.97,759.925,761.393,This is a community problem that is huge.,11,,
106,0.97,761.393,783.048,"What is most important is when copper theft is happening, the repairs are generally not simple because it is a destruction of public property and the expenditures, it is not the cost of the replacement of copper, it is the labor and the extensive work that is having to be done.",11,,
107,0.97,783.048,787.253,Any questions from my colleagues?,12,,
108,0.97,787.253,791.423,"Not so much questions, a couple of statements.",13,,
109,0.97,791.423,801.467,Thank you for Referencing the work that the Council did during the process.,13,,
110,0.97,801.467,808.073,I have been thinking of it not just as a city light issue but a city wide issue.,13,,
111,0.97,808.073,812.278,There are other departments that are experiencing theft of scrap metal.,13,,
112,0.97,812.278,829.395,That is why the first of the two budget actions that Council approved was asking the city to develop a city wide asset loss program.,13,,
113,0.97,829.395,871.637,"We found that a lot of these thefts were not being reported to SPD from departments throughout the city, really, a call out to the public and a thanks for notifying me of outages of lighting in my district because that is really what allowed me to realize that this was not a one off problem, it was happening in multiple places and it was sometimes happening and occurring at the same places after the infrastructure had been replaced.",13,,
114,0.97,871.637,885.451,The first budget action was to ask the executive to develop a citywide loss program with expectations for all the departments for what to do when they have experienced these types of thefts.,13,,
115,0.97,885.451,903.936,The second piece really is focused on how we would like to hold the scrap metal collectors and Recyclers responsible for fulfilling their obligation under state law.,13,,
116,0.97,903.936,920.586,"I have had some meetings with, I appreciate city lights participation in that meeting as well, with the trade Association, the folks I met with are eager to help the city, but they need help from the city as well.",13,,
117,0.97,920.586,931.563,I really appreciate the fact that city light is now participating in the theft alert program that exists.,13,,
118,0.97,931.563,943.375,I think we need to work on making sure that all the other departments are participating as well.,13,,
119,0.97,943.375,950.115,"Perhaps for the public, you can say where folks can report outages.",13,,
120,0.97,950.115,957.122,"Again, we all know that people contact me and you prefer if they would contact you directly, getting that information out to the public about where they can report.",13,,
121,0.97,957.122,961.226,We prefer folks report it so we can fix it.,14,,
122,0.97,961.226,971.603,We are developing new processes that will allow us to track to those and we have a Database that we have put together.,14,,
123,0.97,971.603,973.339,We just had a meeting on it yesterday.,14,,
124,0.97,973.339,978.644,"We will pull the information, correct?",14,,
125,0.97,978.644,978.877,Yes.,14,,
126,0.97,978.877,988.687,"And we will be tracking them in the Database and it will allow for, if she hears from Alex because that happens quite often.",14,,
127,0.97,988.687,993.926,It will allow us to access the file and look and see where this is at.,14,,
128,0.97,993.926,1005.137,One of the things that I did not mention when I was talking about recommendations is we are going to develop some criteria that we can use for Prioritization across the utility.,14,,
129,0.97,1005.137,1014.246,"It is really tough, we want to Prioritize replacement, we have limited Proofs.",14,,
130,0.97,1014.246,1036.802,"Even as we look if it makes sense to add crews for this we want to Prioritize based on public safety and we also want to make sure that customers who contact us directly through find it, fix it, or through one of your offices that they can know that they have been heard and they are in the Queue and they have information about when to expect replacement.",14,,
131,0.97,1036.802,1042.674,"Balancing all of that is challenging, but that is the way to go.",14,,
132,0.97,1042.674,1048.18,"On that Prioritization, my recollection is that this is something that we are seeing Southwest and South, correct?",15,,
133,0.97,1048.18,1061.527,"I don't know--there are some big spans that you have heard about in your area that is the case, Mlk Boulevard and the bridge.",16,,
134,0.97,1061.527,1067.633,We have been experiencing it fairly equally in a lot of darker areas.,16,,
135,0.97,1067.633,1083.916,"Lighting is an important public safety prevention tool, or a way to address public safety threats.",17,,
136,0.97,1083.916,1093.058,I would hate to be in a situation where we are Prioritizing in such a way that does not consider that important utility of lighting.,17,,
137,0.97,1093.058,1104.87,"Rather than D Prioritizing your work and making sure you are fixing every outage, I would rather figure out how to get to the root of the issue.",17,,
138,0.97,1104.87,1105.204,Absolutely.,18,,
139,0.97,1105.204,1111.176,It is not financially sustainable long-term.,19,,
140,0.97,1111.176,1111.944,We know that.,19,,
141,0.97,1111.944,1112.344,I agree.,19,,
142,0.97,1112.344,1115.18,It is not your goal as a utility to not fix lights.,20,,
143,0.97,1115.18,1125.824,"We are trying right now because of the public safety issues, in a lot of cases we are going overhead to get the lights back on and then we are coming back and doing Longer- term fixes.",21,,
144,0.97,1125.824,1139.571,"As we are doing the longer-term fixes, that is where we have the opportunity to explore some of these changes in process and standard that will prevent the Reoccurrence which is what we have experienced.",21,,
145,0.97,1139.571,1140.973,We will keep you posted.,21,,
146,0.97,1140.973,1162.928,We have also been actively participating in work that the Mayor's office is leading because lighting is an important deterrent and it is so critical to our community members feeling safe and being out in the community.,21,,
147,0.97,1162.928,1163.328,Thank you.,21,,
148,0.97,1163.328,1163.729,Thank you.,22,,
149,0.97,1163.729,1165.998,Let's jump into the presentation on conservation.,22,,
150,0.97,1165.998,1170.035,Good morning.,23,,
151,0.97,1170.035,1180.612,I am here to talk to you about the 2020 through 2021 conservation assessment and the target.,23,,
152,0.97,1180.612,1182.614,This is part of a tradition that we do.,24,,
153,0.97,1182.614,1184.65,We do a presentation like this every two years to you.,24,,
154,0.97,1184.65,1187.119,This is our sixth time that we have come before this body.,24,,
155,0.97,1187.119,1195.427,I have about 12 slides and I am happy to take questions as you think of them.,24,,
156,0.97,1195.427,1201.466,There are three sections to my presentation.,24,,
157,0.97,1201.466,1203.168,The first is an introduction to conservation at City light.,24,,
158,0.97,1203.168,1207.406,I would like to think of it as conservation 101.,24,,
159,0.97,1207.406,1216.148,"The second is the meat of the presentation and it has to do with the conservation target from 2020 through 2021, that's why we are here.",24,,
160,0.97,1216.148,1218.183,The final section has to do with what does that mean?,24,,
161,0.97,1218.183,1229.161,How will it impact conservation here at City light.,24,,
162,0.97,1229.161,1231.196,We have a long history of doing conservation at city lights.,24,,
163,0.97,1231.196,1233.999,We have been doing it for more than 40 years.,24,,
164,0.97,1233.999,1240.305,That is one of the longest running utility programs and conservation in the country.,24,,
165,0.97,1240.305,1255.32,"As a result of our legacy and current programs, city light annual load was reduced by 157 average Megawatts through 2018 and in everyday English that is the equivalent of 190,000 average Seattle homes.",24,,
166,0.97,1255.32,1257.99,That is a small city.,24,,
167,0.97,1257.99,1269.501,"Shifting to 2018, we saved the annual electricity use of 17,000 average Seattle homes.",24,,
168,0.97,1269.501,1282.648,"We did that through $26 million in incentives and we did that with a portfolio of programs that were offered to all types of customers, residential, commercial, industrial and low income.",24,,
169,0.97,1282.648,1287.452,For the rest of my presentation I will talk about conservation and energy efficiency.,24,,
170,0.97,1287.452,1291.59,They are pretty much equivalent.,24,,
171,0.97,1291.59,1295.494,Sometimes I will say energy efficiency but it also means conservation.,24,,
172,0.97,1295.494,1298.063,What is conservation?,24,,
173,0.97,1298.063,1303.068,And why is it important to city light?,24,,
174,0.97,1303.068,1307.339,Most importantly conservation is a clean resource.,24,,
175,0.97,1307.339,1308.774,What is a resource?,24,,
176,0.97,1308.774,1320.352,A resource is a way of saying where do we get our electricity at City light?,24,,
177,0.97,1320.352,1322.788,If you look at the pie chart it looks like Pac-Man.,24,,
178,0.97,1322.788,1325.29,You can see about 75% of our electricity comes from Hydro sources.,24,,
179,0.97,1325.29,1333.098,The second largest portion of where our resources come from is conservation.,24,,
180,0.97,1333.098,1338.003,"Conservation, the definition, I am going to read to make sure I get it right.",24,,
181,0.97,1338.003,1344.71,Conservation is any method of reducing energy consumption by using less energy to obtain the same amount of useful output.,24,,
182,0.97,1344.71,1359.524,"The classic definition or the classic example is think of a Lightbulb you had as a kid growing up that was incandescent and then think about the Lightbulbs that you see on the shelves at home Depot right now, those are leds.",24,,
183,0.97,1359.524,1369.301,Led uses 75% energy than those conditions that we grew up with and yet it admits the same amount of light.,24,,
184,0.97,1369.301,1372.704,That is the classic example of conservation.,24,,
185,0.97,1372.704,1382.314,"If you were to pull together all the Widgets and systems in the city light territory that we have Incentivized, that is a lot of conserved energy.",24,,
186,0.97,1382.314,1389.454,"That conserved energy is clean, low-cost, and local.",24,,
187,0.97,1389.454,1392.958,Conservation is a big deal at City light.,24,,
188,0.97,1392.958,1396.128,It is the foundation to how we run the utility.,24,,
189,0.97,1396.128,1404.002,"It helps us to achieve greenhouse gas goals, it helps us live to that marker on the bottom of the slide the nation's greenest utility.",24,,
190,0.97,1404.002,1410.942,It is our first choice for load growth in a growing dynamic city.,24,,
191,0.97,1410.942,1418.85,Moreover conservation provides high value to our customer owners High-Paying customers to buy more efficient equipment with incentives.,24,,
192,0.97,1418.85,1427.859,"Customers use less energy, our dollars stay local and we sell more clean energy to the market.",24,,
193,0.97,1427.859,1436.501,"Let's do a deep dive into that green area, where do we get this conservation?",24,,
194,0.97,1436.501,1442.407,Conservation is dominated by lighting.,24,,
195,0.97,1442.407,1444.81,Lighting and uses are more than 40%.,24,,
196,0.97,1444.81,1450.248,Lighting is the foundation upon which all legacy energy efficient programs have been built.,24,,
197,0.97,1450.248,1456.021,It is the least expensive source and it is the easiest to do and quick.,24,,
198,0.97,1456.021,1458.089,We are all familiar with how to change a light all.,24,,
199,0.97,1458.089,1463.528,The next biggest part is No- lighting by 28%.,25,,
200,0.97,1463.528,1473.905,"By Mont Non-Lighting I mean heating, ventilation and air conditioning, Chillers, commercial kitchen equipment and low income Weatherization.",25,,
201,0.97,1473.905,1477.209,We provide incentives for all of those things.,25,,
202,0.97,1477.209,1477.476,Behavior.,25,,
203,0.97,1477.476,1480.612,That is a different one.,25,,
204,0.97,1480.612,1485.851,Behavior is a type of program that we have been offering for 10 years.,25,,
205,0.97,1485.851,1489.955,We are one of the first utilities to do so.,25,,
206,0.97,1489.955,1505.37,"The idea is, if I tell you or someone in your neighborhood that you use more energy than your neighbors do, you are most likely to take some voluntary steps to change your behavior, about 3%.",25,,
207,0.97,1505.37,1514.279,"If you average that's over hundreds, thousands or millions of households, that adds up.",25,,
208,0.97,1514.279,1517.983,The final piece of the pie is regional savings.,25,,
209,0.97,1517.983,1534.466,We work together with more than 140 Northwest utilities to move the regional market by influencing retailers to stock different things on their cells and by ensuring that there is a pipeline of efficient technology coming down the line.,25,,
210,0.97,1534.466,1545.01,"All told, altogether, in one year we save about 14 Megawatts of energy equivalent to 17,000 homes.",25,,
211,0.97,1545.01,1550.048,That is compared to the previous year?,26,,
212,0.97,1550.048,1551.116,That is the next slide.,27,,
213,0.97,1551.116,1555.12,"Before we moved to that, how do you measure that?",28,,
214,0.97,1555.12,1567.933,"I see the number 20%, how do you measure the impact the behavior on conservation?",28,,
215,0.97,1567.933,1570.201,We have a specialized part of our industry that does that.,29,,
216,0.97,1570.201,1572.203,We do that with measurement and verification and evaluation.,29,,
217,0.97,1572.203,1575.54,We do that through studies and we leverage those studies regionally and nationally.,29,,
218,0.97,1575.54,1585.817,"In other words we know we can leverage studies from what is done in New York or what is done in California, or what is done here.",29,,
219,0.97,1585.817,1589.454,On the behavior program we did use a control group.,30,,
220,0.97,1589.454,1595.36,We had folks that participate and we compare that to a control group.,30,,
221,0.97,1595.36,1595.727,Thank you.,31,,
222,0.97,1595.727,1601.833,How does that compare to the previous year?,32,,
223,0.97,1601.833,1611.843,This slide is a 20 year historic view of conservation achievement or how much energy savings conservation programs have delivered.,32,,
224,0.97,1611.843,1615.68,It is an introduction to the conservation target or the reason why we are here today.,32,,
225,0.97,1615.68,1618.283,On the horizontal axis is time.,32,,
226,0.97,1618.283,1628.493,"Even though we have been doing conservation programs for the last 40 years, I made it shorter so it is easier to read.",32,,
227,0.97,1628.493,1638.269,"The vertical axis is average Megawatts, that is energy Savings and one megawatt is equivalent to 1200 residential homes.",32,,
228,0.97,1638.269,1640.472,The green part is the energy savings.,32,,
229,0.97,1640.472,1649.981,"If you look at 2018 you will see a familiar number, you will see we achieved 14 average Megawatts.",32,,
230,0.97,1649.981,1655.954,You will see that we were able to achieve that through lighting.,32,,
231,0.97,1655.954,1663.094,We have predominantly been getting our savings through lighting over time.,32,,
232,0.97,1663.094,1673.538,"The other thing I want to draw your attention to, when you look at this achievement over time, you see our opportunities shift grader and lower.",32,,
233,0.97,1673.538,1677.642,You see our achievement shifts greater and lower.,32,,
234,0.97,1677.642,1682.914,You see the portfolio of programs changes over time.,32,,
235,0.97,1682.914,1686.351,You also see that the conservation target will change over time.,32,,
236,0.97,1686.351,1699.564,"If I really dig down, because I like to get a little bit Wonky, you will see that we technically Overachieve.",32,,
237,0.97,1699.564,1703.868,"Meaning that we get more savings, we get more savings above the conservation target.",32,,
238,0.97,1703.868,1706.471,This means we capture more savings earlier than we had to.,32,,
239,0.97,1706.471,1709.074,Back to my question.,33,,
240,0.97,1709.074,1711.576,"The 14 average megawatt, what is the baseline?",33,,
241,0.97,1711.576,1717.282,Is that the previous year?,33,,
242,0.97,1717.282,1723.254,The additional acquisition.,34,,
243,0.97,1723.254,1724.155,We think of acquiring.,34,,
244,0.97,1724.155,1726.891,We think of energy efficiency as a resource and we think of acquiring.,34,,
245,0.97,1726.891,1730.662,We talked about the cumulative savings of about 157 Megawatts.,34,,
246,0.97,1730.662,1733.898,That is adding those years.,34,,
247,0.97,1733.898,1742.207,"For instance, the target of 14 is in addition to what we are already experiencing, the cumulative of the year before it is incremental.",34,,
248,0.97,1742.207,1746.911,Going back to when?,35,,
249,0.97,1746.911,1747.178,1977.,36,,
250,0.97,1747.178,1751.116,Things do roll off over time.,37,,
251,0.97,1751.116,1757.122,A major has a life associated with it.,37,,
252,0.97,1757.122,1768.032,"Another way of answering your question if I understand it correctly, if you look at 2017 you can see we achieved about 16 average Megawatts and what we achieved last year was about 14.",38,,
253,0.97,1768.032,1774.672,Where does that spike--can you help the flesh this out a little more?,39,,
254,0.97,1774.672,1782.847,How does that spike in 2017 occur as compared to 2018?,39,,
255,0.97,1782.847,1788.686,"I am getting ahead, there is a downward trend in opportunity and energy efficiency and conservation.",40,,
256,0.97,1788.686,1793.958,The reason for that I will get to in future slides.,40,,
257,0.97,1793.958,1798.663,The punchline is that we have transformed the market.,40,,
258,0.97,1798.663,1805.17,We also have different levels of opportunity based on the building stock and on the energy codes that are here.,40,,
259,0.97,1805.17,1813.545,In 2017 we had larger opportunity is that a reasonable understanding?,41,,
260,0.97,1813.545,1813.778,Yes.,42,,
261,0.97,1813.778,1820.451,In 2018 we had less of an opportunity and that's how we got this number.,43,,
262,0.97,1820.451,1820.852,Yes.,44,,
263,0.97,1820.852,1827.592,There is a slide I will linger on a little bit down the way.,44,,
264,0.97,1827.592,1832.597,"If you think about lighting, that's what we all remember.",45,,
265,0.97,1832.597,1836.668,We went from the old light bulbs that we used to like and then the compact fluorescent light bulbs.,45,,
266,0.97,1836.668,1843.408,"If you look at some of these peaks, that would be kind of the peak of Cfl's.",45,,
267,0.97,1843.408,1846.811,That is when everyone was converting their old Incandescence to Cfl.,45,,
268,0.97,1846.811,1854.385,Lighting was a huge issue and then it comes down.,45,,
269,0.97,1854.385,1857.422,New technology emerges in the form of led which is giving you additional savings.,45,,
270,0.97,1857.422,1865.53,What happens is the market transforms until new technology comes that provides a new opportunity and you will see those peaks and valleys.,45,,
271,0.97,1865.53,1892.523,Along the way we are providing incentives to customers and other market actors to accelerate that adoption and when it reaches a certain point we will lock in the savings with higher and higher efficiency standards at the national level and then here in Seattle we have our own commercial code for commercial buildings and we Ratchet that up.,46,,
272,0.97,1892.523,1897.362,"Maybe you will talk about this, one of the big stories is televisions.",47,,
273,0.97,1897.362,1901.299,There was a time when you could buy an energy efficient television essentially that market was transformed.,47,,
274,0.97,1901.299,1905.403,Now you can't buy a Non-Energy efficient television.,47,,
275,0.97,1905.403,1915.546,You are not Incentivizing those anymore because there is no basis.,47,,
276,0.97,1915.546,1921.386,Bonneville who helps to fund programs with our customers does the same thing.,47,,
277,0.97,1921.386,1928.559,"Kind of like with electric vehicles, Tesla was providing all these incentives and when they got to a certain number it dropped.",47,,
278,0.97,1928.559,1935.8,It is a similar approach.,47,,
279,0.97,1935.8,1941.506,This slide is the end of conservation 101.,48,,
280,0.97,1941.506,1953.618,"What I want to do with the next slide is talk about that Blackline, the conservation target and how we arrive at it.",48,,
281,0.97,1953.618,1965.697,"We are required to calculate that Blackline, conservation target, partly because we are required to do so by initiative 937.",48,,
282,0.97,1965.697,1971.936,I'm going to start at the upper left and then go down.,48,,
283,0.97,1971.936,1989.187,"937 was approved by voters, it applies to all large utilities or those with more than 25,000 customers and it requires utilities to identify and pursue all cost-effective conservation.",48,,
284,0.97,1989.187,1991.856,Cost-effective is an important word but we will come back to in a bit.,48,,
285,0.97,1991.856,2015.313,"Going to the upper right we calculate that all Cost- effective conservation using methodology that are set by the Northwest power is an entity based in Portland that oversees regional energy planning for Oregon, Washington Idaho and Montana.",48,,
286,0.97,2015.313,2017.915,We are required to set these conservation targets every two years.,48,,
287,0.97,2017.915,2021.753,That is why we come before you every two years.,48,,
288,0.97,2021.753,2029.794,We are required to report the savings and targets to the state.,48,,
289,0.97,2029.794,2043.541,We set conservation target with conservation potential estimate that was created by the Northwest power conservation Council.,48,,
290,0.97,2043.541,2050.181,"This assessment is 150 page report, which I believe you got a copy of.",48,,
291,0.97,2050.181,2058.289,This is the result of a Year- long study that we did with our consultant and with many colleagues across the utility.,48,,
292,0.97,2058.289,2074.939,"The purpose of this report is to identify how much conservation city light can get in two years, 10 years and 20 years and the input change, the assumptions change which is why we have to do it every two years.",48,,
293,0.97,2074.939,2077.008,This report is specific to our service territory.,49,,
294,0.97,2077.008,2093.791,"What is really fascinating is in some ways you would think that we are very similar to the, power or very similar to, but we have different customer bases.",49,,
295,0.97,2093.791,2097.662,"Tacoma has industrial customers, Chenault's PD has high rises.",49,,
296,0.97,2097.662,2102.166,That changes the amount and timing of opportunities that we have.,49,,
297,0.97,2102.166,2119.484,"Though we are required by I-937 to do this assessment and set the target, we use the outputs of the conservation potential assessment in a lot of ways here at the utility.",49,,
298,0.97,2119.484,2122.687,It is a foundation to our integrated resource plan.,49,,
299,0.97,2122.687,2134.866,It is a foundation to load forecasting and it is important for conservation planning.,49,,
300,0.97,2134.866,2137.702,"Now that I have talked about the conservation potential assessment, the conservation target.",50,,
301,0.97,2137.702,2138.536,Let's get to the punchline.,50,,
302,0.97,2138.536,2142.006,What is it?,50,,
303,0.97,2142.006,2153.985,"The Conservtion target for 2020 through 2021, I am looking at the middle column is 21.3 average Megawatts.",50,,
304,0.97,2153.985,2158.055,"That is the equivalent of 26,000 homes, that is over two years.",50,,
305,0.97,2158.055,2162.126,"We also look at the conservation target over 10 years, that is the right column.",50,,
306,0.97,2162.126,2168.032,"You can see it is 82.7 average Megawatts or 100,000 homes.",50,,
307,0.97,2168.032,2176.507,You will see if you look in there that the greatest opportunity is within the commercial sector there.,50,,
308,0.97,2176.507,2191.289,"The reason why is a, we have done a lot of program achievements in the residential sector and commercial sector has opportunities that is less expensive.",50,,
309,0.97,2191.289,2191.822,How about some context?,50,,
310,0.97,2191.822,2192.757,How does this compare?,50,,
311,0.97,2192.757,2193.558,This gets to the question.,50,,
312,0.97,2193.558,2203.534,The conservation target that was set two years ago is on the right side of this slide.,50,,
313,0.97,2203.534,2218.316,"You can see it is 24.6 average Megawatts or the equivalent of about 30,000 homes . You can see that the current target, the one that I am presenting today in the middle column is 21.3 Megawatts.",50,,
314,0.97,2218.316,2221.986,That is about 13% lower.,50,,
315,0.97,2221.986,2235.6,One thing I want you to notice is in the 2018 through 2019 study we included Streetlighting which is a topic that came up earlier today.,50,,
316,0.97,2235.6,2240.137,The reason why it is not included in the 2020 study is because we converted the market.,50,,
317,0.97,2240.137,2243.307,It looks like you are familiar with that.,50,,
318,0.97,2243.307,2243.908,Yes.,51,,
319,0.97,2243.908,2244.575,It also says that.,51,,
320,0.97,2244.575,2245.576,I do remember.,51,,
321,0.97,2245.576,2250.815,"What changed, what caused that 13%?",52,,
322,0.97,2250.815,2253.517,This is your slide.,52,,
323,0.97,2253.517,2254.919,There are three reasons.,52,,
324,0.97,2254.919,2265.997,"First, renewable energy cost have decreased by 27% since the last time that we set the conservation target.",52,,
325,0.97,2265.997,2277.908,I mentioned before that we need to go after all cost-effective conservation and a key input into what is cost-effective is to identify what is the thing that we would purchase.,52,,
326,0.97,2277.908,2285.049,"What is the source of energy that we would purchase if we did not do energy efficiency, we would purchase more renewable energy.",52,,
327,0.97,2285.049,2294.525,From reading the headlines in the energy sector you know the cost of Renewables has come down specifically solar and wind.,52,,
328,0.97,2294.525,2296.794,That is a worldwide phenomenon.,52,,
329,0.97,2296.794,2304.468,The second reason why the target has gone down is because electricity demand is flat.,52,,
330,0.97,2304.468,2309.573,We update the load forecast every so often and we did it more recently.,52,,
331,0.97,2309.573,2324.588,"The result of the load forecast show even though this is a growing and dynamic city filled with cranes, I saw a lot this morning on my way in, electricity demand is flat.",52,,
332,0.97,2324.588,2328.659,That is partly due to the 40 years of conservation history that we have.,52,,
333,0.97,2328.659,2333.898,"Lastly, this gets at the market transformation that Debra and Craig talked about.",52,,
334,0.97,2333.898,2338.002,We have a lot of new energy codes.,52,,
335,0.97,2338.002,2356.487,The 2019 legislative session at the state introduced and passed a bunch of new energy codes and standards and that is great for all Washingtonians that means that everyone gets equipment.,52,,
336,0.97,2356.487,2366.63,But it makes it more challenging for us as a you'll tilt utility because we offer programs.,52,,
337,0.97,2366.63,2367.631,Did I answer your question?,52,,
338,0.97,2367.631,2371.736,Once a customer is required to do something there is no longer a reason to provide an incentive.,53,,
339,0.97,2371.736,2373.07,That is what we are talking about.,53,,
340,0.97,2373.07,2386.55,"The other thing I would say, this goes to the first point, earlier you provided a great definition of conservation and what I want to say is conservation is one type of what we call distributed energy resource.",53,,
341,0.97,2386.55,2387.551,This puts it into context.,53,,
342,0.97,2387.551,2396.727,Distributed energy resources are anything other than central Jen.,53,,
343,0.97,2396.727,2401.632,Hydro power is centralized generalization.,53,,
344,0.97,2401.632,2413.878,What true is customers are also increasingly interested in other forms of distributed energy resources because as those price points have come down it is more accessible to more people.,53,,
345,0.97,2413.878,2417.181,Councilmember Morales.,54,,
346,0.97,2417.181,2424.355,This is all very interesting and RAISES a few questions for me that I think are connected.,55,,
347,0.97,2424.355,2431.896,I will just ask them and you can answer as you think is appropriate.,55,,
348,0.97,2431.896,2450.514,"We know that the targets have gone down a little and you explained why, my question is, my understanding is you said something about basically the low hanging fruit we have taken and now things have changed.",55,,
349,0.97,2450.514,2471.235,"What does this mean for future targets and what does this mean for additional conservation measures, and what does this electricity--how does electricity demand change if we start moving toward building more Electrification.",55,,
350,0.97,2471.235,2471.836,Great questions.,56,,
351,0.97,2471.836,2479.143,My understanding is we are building 2/3 of our buildings are all Electric.,57,,
352,0.97,2479.143,2485.916,"If we try to move toward requiring 100% or moving in that direction, how does that change?",57,,
353,0.97,2485.916,2493.757,"I am going to take a stab at your questions, please bring me back if I don't address all of them.",58,,
354,0.97,2493.757,2501.732,We do the conservation potential assessment and we set this target based on information that we have at the time.,58,,
355,0.97,2501.732,2508.239,The best available information that we had at the time said that our load forecast is flat.,58,,
356,0.97,2508.239,2525.189,What we see coming down the Pike is potentially a future with more Electrification through vehicles and potentially due to carbon legislation.,58,,
357,0.97,2525.189,2532.997,If those come to pass or as those come to pass that will impact the load forecast and it will impact greatly our opportunity for conservation going forward.,58,,
358,0.97,2532.997,2538.235,Based off the information we have currently it is a downward trend.,58,,
359,0.97,2538.235,2549.513,"If you ask me what is going to happen two years from now, I would say based on information that we have now it is downward Trending.",58,,
360,0.97,2549.513,2556.153,Subject to what happens with legislation and how much electric transportation takes off we could be seeing a different story.,58,,
361,0.97,2556.153,2568.132,We are getting ready to do a couple of studies right now to look at what the implications of mass electric Ation are for the free utility system for buildings and transportation.,59,,
362,0.97,2568.132,2596.16,"We are kicking off a piece of work with the electric power research Institute and we will look at a couple of scenarios, one will be over the planning for the integrated resource plan which is a 20 year planning and based on a statement of legislative intent those adopted by the Council we will be looking at what are those impacts likely to be if we were to have accelerated adoption by 2030.",59,,
363,0.97,2596.16,2604.335,"Right now in the load forecast, I'm going off of memory.",60,,
364,0.97,2604.335,2607.137,I believe we continue to show loads declining for at least another 10 years.,60,,
365,0.97,2607.137,2613.644,That is with the current forecast from Metro and ferries and others.,60,,
366,0.97,2613.644,2619.35,We are have heard they are interested in accelerating their deployment of electric.,60,,
367,0.97,2619.35,2622.186,That certainly will accelerate that.,60,,
368,0.97,2622.186,2629.159,It is a decline for a number of years.,60,,
369,0.97,2629.159,2661.425,"By the way, just because it is always worth putting this in, that is one of the primary challenges that we face which is how to continue to do the right thing, do what our customers want and Prioritize responsible use of this critical resource while we manage the Affordability impacts of continuously decreasing load.",60,,
370,0.97,2661.425,2665.262,I have a number of other questions and I know the committee has quite a bit to get to.,61,,
371,0.97,2665.262,2671.735,Maybe if we could follow up with a meeting and if we need to put questions on the record I will follow-up at the public hearing.,61,,
372,0.97,2671.735,2672.136,Sounds great.,62,,
373,0.97,2672.136,2678.442,I have one more slide.,63,,
374,0.97,2678.442,2691.488,What does this mean for Seattle city light works it means that conservation remains a good value for the utility and we will continue our strong investment in conservation.,63,,
375,0.97,2691.488,2707.071,"Conservation is a cornerstone of how we run the utility and will continue to offer a portfolio of programs for residential, low income, commercial and industrial customers.",63,,
376,0.97,2707.071,2709.74,This is also a little bit of a Canary in the coal mine.,63,,
377,0.97,2709.74,2713.377,Things are changing and our world is changing and we have to change to.,63,,
378,0.97,2713.377,2728.192,Our opportunities are evolving specifically in the future we will be offering more hope building programs and solutions than less of things like lighting which is cheap and easy to do.,63,,
379,0.97,2728.192,2745.476,It means that in the future we will be offering more social equity programs even though our programs have been really successful over time there are pockets that we have missed and we need to target our investments there.,63,,
380,0.97,2745.476,2752.316,"Third, we will consider location and time value of conservation.",63,,
381,0.97,2752.316,2759.923,Conservation when targeted can really help with areas of the grid that are stretched.,63,,
382,0.97,2759.923,2769.7,If we focus where we offer conservation in those areas there is a lot of great benefits financially that we can bring to the utility and to our customer owners.,63,,
383,0.97,2769.7,2786.316,"Lastly, we talked about this, with the future as we March towards Electrification with vehicles and potentially with carbon legislation, there is an increased need for conservation over time.",63,,
384,0.97,2786.316,2791.522,"Our opportunities are changing, our commitment to conservation remains strong.",63,,
385,0.97,2791.522,2794.424,Thank you.,63,,
386,0.97,2794.424,2794.758,Thank you.,64,,
387,0.97,2794.758,2797.06,Just two quick notes.,65,,
388,0.97,2797.06,2814.745,I think yesterday we transmitted a memo on two of our programs that are kind of new and they do kind of whole building and it is Performance- based energy efficiency and energy efficiency as a service.,65,,
389,0.97,2814.745,2816.146,You will get information about that.,65,,
390,0.97,2816.146,2829.693,Those are probably the two newest programs that Craig and his team have launched energy efficiency as a service in particular we are a leader in releasing that program.,65,,
391,0.97,2829.693,2832.462,One of a kind in the industry.,66,,
392,0.97,2832.462,2834.097,Not just in the U. S. but globally.,66,,
393,0.97,2834.097,2848.512,"I have been at this, Deborah mentioned the years of experience, I have been at this for 42 years and I have had the privilege of having a clean energy job my entire career.",66,,
394,0.97,2848.512,2856.386,At no point have I seen this much change and exciting change as what is going on now.,66,,
395,0.97,2856.386,2866.33,We at city lights are in a good decision to innovate and lead the industry in the future.,66,,
396,0.97,2866.33,2869.333,Truly the energy efficiency as a service it was a hard lift.,67,,
397,0.97,2869.333,2875.839,These guys were super successful because they were able to bring everybody along.,67,,
398,0.97,2875.839,2880.577,Not everybody got what they wanted But everyone moved along and I think everyone is happy with the product.,67,,
399,0.97,2880.577,2883.213,It was not easy.,67,,
400,0.97,2883.213,2896.627,"The other thing, Councilmember Morales I saw you circle something that I want to call out, we do have a pilot Underplay right now call the energy equity program.",67,,
401,0.97,2896.627,2902.165,That is a pilot that is specifically being offered for some of our lowest income households.,67,,
402,0.97,2902.165,2909.873,That is a great example of what Jessica is talking about because it has Wraparound services.,67,,
403,0.97,2909.873,2916.48,Customers get a reduced rate and that is a program that they were very involved in doing.,67,,
404,0.97,2916.48,2921.385,They get a flat as opposed to a two-year rate without a fixed cost but they get a lot of services wrapped around them.,67,,
405,0.97,2921.385,2933.997,"We hope customers with Short- term Affordability, we help the customer by upgrading the building stock so that they have lower ongoing cost.",67,,
406,0.97,2933.997,2938.268,We are always looking for things that we can do that play into those different markets.,67,,
407,0.97,2938.268,2957.321,"Another one, if I can take a minute to highlight the work we are doing with the housing development consortium to look at how we can reduce the long- term cost for affordable housing with a combination of energy efficiency and distributed resources.",68,,
408,0.97,2957.321,2958.021,Thank you.,69,,
409,0.97,2958.021,2961.024,Any final comments?,69,,
410,0.97,2961.024,2965.829,"I think you may have mentioned this at the start, what are the next steps?",70,,
411,0.97,2965.829,2971.535,The memo said that there is a public hearing.,70,,
412,0.97,2971.535,2977.24,We will have the public hearing at the next committee meeting.,71,,
413,0.97,2977.24,2979.376,We wanted to have the initial presentation and have questions.,71,,
414,0.97,2979.376,2982.846,It will come back for the formal public hearing part and then we will advance from there.,71,,
415,0.97,2982.846,2986.35,I would love an opportunity to follow up with you all.,72,,
416,0.97,2986.35,2988.218,We will work on scheduling that with your office.,73,,
417,0.97,2988.218,2988.618,Thank you.,73,,
418,0.97,2988.618,2993.924,Thank you.,74,,
419,0.97,2993.924,2994.458,Thank you.,75,,
420,0.97,2994.458,3005.969,The second item of business concerns an agreement between sound transit and the city of Seattle for the Northgate pedestrian and bicycle bridge.,76,,
421,0.97,3005.969,3035.098,"Counsel bill 119741 & GT; & GT; & GT; an ordinance relating to the central Puget sound regional transit authority (""sound transit""); authorizing execution of a funding and cooperative agreement for Northgate station area access improvements between sound transit and the city of Seattle; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.",77,,
422,0.97,3035.098,3035.699,Thank you.,78,,
423,0.97,3035.699,3038.568,Welcome to our guests.,78,,
424,0.97,3038.568,3047.744,We will get you set up on the Powerpoint.,78,,
425,0.97,3063.059,3070.1,"Let's start with introductions, Eric Strauch project manager for the Seattle Department of transportation and",79,,
426,0.97,3070.1,3075.138,Bill Laborde from the cell Department of transportation.,80,,
427,0.97,3075.138,3078.008,I will kick it off.,81,,
428,0.97,3078.008,3093.023,"We talked about our vision and mission before and noting that are six core values for the Seattle Department of transportation are equity, safety, Sustainability, livability and excellence.",81,,
429,0.97,3093.023,3112.242,I would say that this is a project that touches on all six but it also shows the Department's persistence because we have had this for quite a while.,81,,
430,0.97,3126.723,3138.702,We are going to get the Powerpoint presentation set up.,82,,
431,0.97,3186.583,3189.119,We will have this set up in a moment.,83,,
432,0.97,3189.119,3190.854,I appreciate everyone's patience.,83,,
433,0.97,3190.854,3197.227,I can start.,84,,
434,0.97,3197.227,3201.264,While we are waiting for the slide to come back up I will talk about the background.,84,,
435,0.97,3201.264,3214.911,"This project, the Ped bridge and other projects that we will talk about go back to conversations that began in 2010 involving Metro, King County Metro, sound transit and the city.",84,,
436,0.97,3214.911,3226.156,At the time Councilmember Richard: was the member of sound transit and he represented the city.,84,,
437,0.97,3226.156,3228.892,We had a lot of involvement from the Maple leaf community.,84,,
438,0.97,3228.892,3243.106,I think everyone's interest was in seeing the Northgate station area would not just turn into a park and ride that it would be the core of the Trinity built around the light rail station.,84,,
439,0.97,3243.106,3280.744,By 2012 those conversations had moved into an agreement between the three parties that King County Metro would take the lead on transit development and that the city and sound transit would partner in funding if possible a Ped bridge across I- five two North Seattle college and a series of projects that Eric will talk in more detail about in a few minutes.,84,,
440,0.97,3290.72,3292.889,"Bill, you are trying to Multitask.",85,,
441,0.97,3292.889,3306.936,"When you say that King County Metro is taking the lead, can you tell me what you met meant?",85,,
442,0.97,3306.936,3309.172,That is the last part that needs to fall into place.,86,,
443,0.97,3309.172,3329.592,"They are the property owner and they of course have completed a couple of development projects that one was senior housing focused and the other is market focused and how retail, they have completed those projects before these conversations have gotten going.",86,,
444,0.97,3329.592,3344.074,They do have some expense with development on transfer sites around the county.,86,,
445,0.97,3344.074,3346.71,They offered to continue to take the lead as the property owner.,86,,
446,0.97,3346.71,3353.616,Taking the lead is by merit of them owning the property.,87,,
447,0.97,3353.616,3363.793,"As the owners of the property they will manage the process for identifying a developer, doing Rp's.",87,,
448,0.97,3363.793,3364.194,Correct.,88,,
449,0.97,3364.194,3368.832,"King County Metro as the property owner, is the lead.",88,,
450,0.97,3368.832,3370.9,By 2012 there were agreements in place.,88,,
451,0.97,3370.9,3377.607,The Council at the time passed a resolution Memorializing or Articulating those agreements.,88,,
452,0.97,3377.607,3387.15,"The sound transit board also passed a motion with a written agreement, Mo way was never put into place.",88,,
453,0.97,3387.15,3399.729,The next step in the process was 2015 the levees that Seattle past and also the state passed a transportation package connecting Washington that included $10 million for the Ped bridge project.,88,,
454,0.97,3399.729,3406.002,This is good information in this overview.,89,,
455,0.97,3406.002,3408.471,Is there a current cost break out of who is paying what?,89,,
456,0.97,3408.471,3424.087,"I remember at the time connecting Washington and move Seattle levy were passed, $10 million were put in for each entity because the approximate cost was about, I think it had risen to 35 million.",89,,
457,0.97,3424.087,3426.823,I understand today we are at 52 million.,89,,
458,0.97,3426.823,3433.997,"I want to just, for the record to reflect, these are normal escalation cost.",89,,
459,0.97,3433.997,3442.806,"I'm interested to know more about as the cost escalate, how are we able to divide the cost sharing?",89,,
460,0.97,3442.806,3452.982,Sub transit commitment was $10 million and 5 million for the Ped bridge and 5 million for the other projects.,90,,
461,0.97,3452.982,3471.034,Even if we could not have move forward on the head bridge they were committed to 5 million for the bicycle pedestrian access for the first Avenue northeast.,90,,
462,0.97,3471.034,3475.305,Also sidewalk access projects.,90,,
463,0.97,3475.305,3505.368,"The state committed 10 million and we had another, I think 15 million and the levy, at least 10 million in the levy, the escalation is a little bit of a complicated story because the first cost estimates that were floated were actually floated before 2012 when this was a project proposed by King County Metro and the city and they never had done any engineering on the project.",90,,
464,0.97,3505.368,3506.569,It was just a cost estimate.,90,,
465,0.97,3506.569,3518.781,When we started doing engineering we started to see higher cost and altered the design to get it within the budget that the city could afford with contributions from the state and sound transit.,90,,
466,0.97,3518.781,3531.561,There is a big difference between a bridge across the freeway and a bridge that connects the communities that need to be connected.,91,,
467,0.97,3531.561,3543.806,"I think the construction cost are pretty consistent with some of the earlier cost estimates that were floated in 2012, there are other soft costs on top of that and escalation.",92,,
468,0.97,3543.806,3546.809,And eight years down the road.,93,,
469,0.97,3546.809,3549.913,If we do not have a cost break out today we can follow up after committee.,93,,
470,0.97,3549.913,3553.082,There is one in the agreement.,94,,
471,0.97,3553.082,3554.517,I will let Eric take over from here.,94,,
472,0.97,3554.517,3561.424,Part of the agreement with sound transit involves Nonmotorized access projects.,95,,
473,0.97,3561.424,3561.824,Thank you.,95,,
474,0.97,3561.824,3566.496,I do not plan on going over these individually but we do have several showing.,95,,
475,0.97,3566.496,3580.476,"We have 10 different projects that were done between bicycle, pedestrian lanes, Greenways, those kinds of Nonmotorized improvements.",95,,
476,0.97,3580.476,3584.581,Here we have a rendering of what the project will look like.,95,,
477,0.97,3584.581,3589.252,I will start with number one which is on the North sound college side.,95,,
478,0.97,3589.252,3599.228,As you move East we have overlooked area that we have done to look at the Wetland area.,95,,
479,0.97,3599.228,3625.455,Three and four is where we span over I-5 . There is another resting area at the corner of number four and the structure heads to the North where it connects to the sound transit station and the pedestrians also have the option of going down the structure to first and 100th Avenue.,95,,
480,0.97,3625.455,3629.959,Here are a couple of renderings on what it will look like on the bridge.,95,,
481,0.97,3629.959,3643.373,As part of the agreement we are connecting to the sound transit light rail station which you can see on the bottom of the rendering.,95,,
482,0.97,3643.373,3655.018,I will just note that the agreement includes several provisions including affirming the city and sound transit responsibilities for all of the access projects.,96,,
483,0.97,3655.018,3658.321,Some of them are underway already.,96,,
484,0.97,3658.321,3659.322,The bridge just broke ground.,96,,
485,0.97,3659.322,3677.04,"It also affirms that in the end, when the project is completed, who owns what, sound transit, the station and the city will own the other assets including the head bike bridge.",96,,
486,0.97,3677.04,3700.229,"As part of the agreement we have exhibit B that shows the project list which are the Nonmotorized projects and also the bridge itself as the lead agency for the environmental review, sound transit has the documents which we have been coordinating with them as we went through the design process.",97,,
487,0.97,3700.229,3704.033,Grant instruction for access to the Ped bridge.,97,,
488,0.97,3704.033,3716.979,Both projects will coordinator we right now we have by illegally Biweekly meetings to make sure we are staying in sync with each other.,97,,
489,0.97,3716.979,3723.286,The city is required to establish an agreement with the Ws adopt an Army Corps permits.,97,,
490,0.97,3723.286,3733.663,We have gotten in contact with Wadot.,97,,
491,0.97,3733.663,3739.569,Sound transit has been working on the station for quite a while but we are catching up.,97,,
492,0.97,3739.569,3744.674,Are we named naming this bridge?,98,,
493,0.97,3744.674,3748.311,The bridge has not been named.,99,,
494,0.97,3748.311,3757.887,There is work going on with Councilmember Juarez to work on the naming of the bridge.,99,,
495,0.97,3757.887,3769.232,We will let the Council way in and the public.,100,,
496,0.97,3769.232,3774.337,So it will not be the Mccraken.,101,,
497,0.97,3774.337,3778.741,That is a name we are not supporting.,102,,
498,0.97,3778.741,3780.009,Just a couple of points.,103,,
499,0.97,3780.009,3790.82,There is a lot of Standard boilerplate in the agreement including indemnification which is always a tricky issue between the city and other public agencies.,103,,
500,0.97,3790.82,3814.777,"We have done enough agreements with sound transit that we have that down and the indemnification is what everyone would expect is that everyone is responsible for their work, their workers, their contractors to the extent that they are a joint liability to the extent that we will indemnify each other.",103,,
501,0.97,3814.777,3817.847,Just to follow up on Councilmember Strauss's question.,104,,
502,0.97,3817.847,3825.087,We do have exhibit D which is helpful to show the cost to date.,104,,
503,0.97,3825.087,3842.738,"However, I think what we are looking for, we are very excited about this project, we are looking for a basic sources of funds and the uses and the construction cost for the total project, to add that as an item.",104,,
504,0.97,3842.738,3865.895,"We can provide you more information on the current cost and I will say that again, the state has capped a $10 million contribution which is in the process of being paid to the city and it should not be affected by 976.",105,,
505,0.97,3865.895,3875.805,And the sound transit contribution is in this agreement and will be charging against that $10 million contribution.,105,,
506,0.97,3875.805,3884.447,It is just useful to see both sources and uses together in one document.,106,,
507,0.97,3884.447,3895.358,"That is one of the things in the new improved fiscal NOTE is to have that uniform description of here is where the money is coming from, here is where it is going so we do not have to piece it together.",106,,
508,0.97,3895.358,3905.968,"Just to be clear, the rest of the funding for the project is coming from the city beyond those two contributions.",107,,
509,0.97,3905.968,3906.535,Thank you.,108,,
510,0.97,3906.535,3909.438,"The schedule, we have started construction.",109,,
511,0.97,3909.438,3922.451,"Right now we are on path to have the bridge open in the fall of 2021, which lines up with what we are hearing from sound transit on when they plan on opening that station.",109,,
512,0.97,3922.451,3931.494,"You will not get a hard date from sound transit at this time, but we are trying to work together for when we both open.",109,,
513,0.97,3931.494,3931.794,Great.,110,,
514,0.97,3931.794,3938.401,Any questions or comments?,110,,
515,0.97,3938.401,3950.813,"Chair, this may be something in my area of responsibility, I did not receive a briefing before this Committee hearing, committee meeting about this scope schedule and agreement.",111,,
516,0.97,3950.813,3957.353,I typically would not feel comfortable voting on an agreement without having a briefing beforehand.,111,,
517,0.97,3957.353,3968.03,I am allowing the record to reflect and letting all staff no moving forward I will not take a vote on agreements without being briefed.,111,,
518,0.97,3968.03,3985.348,Committee presentation is helpful although it does not allow the amount of time for me to go into the depth of questions that I require to have answered to fill control voting on an agreement between the city and another entity.,111,,
519,0.97,3985.348,3991.253,Because of my history with this project in particular I am able to read through this agreement and feel comfortable.,111,,
520,0.97,3991.253,4002.832,I am just letting everyone know that this will be the last time that I vote on something without having a briefing beforehand.,111,,
521,0.97,4002.832,4003.265,Definitely noted.,112,,
522,0.97,4003.265,4009.138,"Any other comments, colleagues?",113,,
523,0.97,4009.138,4020.282,I would like to have a motion to recommend passage of counsel build bill 119741 to pass on to the full council.,113,,
524,0.97,4020.282,4021.884,We got a second.,113,,
525,0.97,4021.884,4030.059,All those in favor of passing counsel bill 119741 please Ndicate by voting aye.,113,,
526,0.97,4030.059,4033.696,Richard pan.,113,,
527,0.97,4033.696,4035.765,"Those opposed, no.",113,,
528,0.97,4035.765,4036.298,Any extensions?,113,,
529,0.97,4036.298,4036.799,The motion carries.,113,,
530,0.97,4036.799,4044.206,It will be forwarded to the full council.,113,,
531,0.97,4044.206,4050.212,The third item today concerns authorizing the city to accept grant funding for specific capital improvement projects.,114,,
532,0.97,4050.212,4057.219,We will read that item into the record.,114,,
533,0.97,4057.219,4109.972,"Counsel bill 119743 & GT; & GT; & GT; an ordinance relating to grant funds from Non-City sources; authorizing the director of transportation to accept specified grants and execute related agreements for and on behalf of the city; amending ordinance 126000, which adopted the 2020 budget, including the 2020-2025 capital improvement program (CIP); changing appropriations for the Seattle Department of transportation; revising allocations and spending plans for certain projects in the 2020-2025 CIP; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.",115,,
534,0.97,4109.972,4114.343,Let's have introductions.,116,,
535,0.97,4114.343,4117.58,I am Devon.,117,,
536,0.97,4117.58,4124.086,I am Chloe Wilkes.,118,,
537,0.97,4124.086,4127.756,Please proceed.,119,,
538,0.97,4127.756,4128.557,As the title suggests.,120,,
539,0.97,4128.557,4133.395,We are here to present a Standalone grant acceptance ordinance.,120,,
540,0.97,4133.395,4141.504,Typically you see grant acceptance as part of the quarterly supplemental financial legislation that is brought to you.,120,,
541,0.97,4141.504,4150.913,Because of the timing of the grants that we often receive and due to needing to get starting on the work Fdot typically brings this around this time every year.,120,,
542,0.97,4150.913,4154.517,We are doing that today.,120,,
543,0.97,4154.517,4166.795,I hope this does not mean that we will not be seeing Submittals because I have noticed a bit of a divergence in the schedule for the Supplementals last year.,121,,
544,0.97,4166.795,4187.149,I just would hate to see Department by Department beginning new practices and us not having that historical opportunity that the Council has to participate in the supplemental process.,121,,
545,0.97,4187.149,4191.754,That is noted.,122,,
546,0.97,4191.754,4199.862,Regardless of timing and the first quarter supplemental we have had to come about this time of year with a request for grant approval just because of the way that some of our grant cycles work.,122,,
547,0.97,4199.862,4205.634,This is no indication if the way of timing.,122,,
548,0.97,4205.634,4212.908,In this case the grant funded projects have construction deadlines that are driven by sound transit schedule.,123,,
549,0.97,4212.908,4214.677,We are hoping to begin design this spring.,123,,
550,0.97,4214.677,4223.586,That is why we bring those to you outside of that quarterly supplemental process.,123,,
551,0.97,4223.586,4230.893,The bill didn't read--go back.,124,,
552,0.97,4230.893,4239.668,I just wanted to point out the grant that we are looking at accepting will apply to the mobility and safety values.,124,,
553,0.97,4239.668,4245.574,The ordinance you're considering ACCEPTS and up operate time sensitive grant.,124,,
554,0.97,4245.574,4262.858,"One of which will fund several access projects near the Judkins park link light rail station and one that will fund as their way connection to the stairway Beach link light rail station, I will not say that again.",124,,
555,0.97,4262.858,4274.003,Both are coming from a funding source come the sound transit axis fund it was a $100 million pot of money made available as part of the 2016 ballot measure.,124,,
556,0.97,4274.003,4279.642,In this competition $50 million was made available but only $10 million per sub area.,124,,
557,0.97,4279.642,4290.452,We were competing for $10 million and we put in applications and received 33% of those funds.,124,,
558,0.97,4290.452,4297.96,As far as I'm aware no sub area receive the full $10 million so we can expect in the next round of competition maybe higher.,124,,
559,0.97,4297.96,4301.163,With that I will hand it over to David.,124,,
560,0.97,4301.163,4305.968,We submitted two application packages as part of this round of awards.,125,,
561,0.97,4305.968,4311.774,The first one being the Jenkins park station access.,125,,
562,0.97,4311.774,4327.389,"That included three projects, a trail lighting project, the trail that connects a lot of Southeast Seattle and the park area with the future station.",125,,
563,0.97,4327.389,4339.034,Hiawatha place stairway connection which is a direct connection to that project feeding into Hiawatha place it's self and some Ada and Walkway grades south of the station.,125,,
564,0.97,4339.034,4345.974,The other package was a package of High-Priority sidewalk and Walkway projects in Southeast Seattle.,125,,
565,0.97,4345.974,4350.979,Among these packages sound transit only selected several projects from each of those to fund.,125,,
566,0.97,4350.979,4359.922,"I have a list of the trail lighting, walkways and stairway connection projects as part of the park project.",125,,
567,0.97,4359.922,4367.629,The only other one they chose to fund was a new stairway connection on South Henderson street.,125,,
568,0.97,4367.629,4374.503,For the Judkins park package the total award amount was $2.4 million.,125,,
569,0.97,4374.503,4379.208,"900,000 for the southeast Seattle package.",125,,
570,0.97,4379.208,4383.045,A little bit about --,125,,
571,0.97,4383.045,4389.351,Do you have a list of other projects that were requested and what did not get funded,126,,
572,0.97,4389.351,4395.124,We can provide that information.,127,,
573,0.97,4395.124,4421.65,"Just a little bit about that, we also kind of went through a selection process of what we were going to apply for based on a large station access study around the Judkins park station a couple of years ago and that informed what we were requesting to know what are the priorities around the Judkins park station and where do they feel like improvements are needed and what can we do in time for the station to open.",127,,
574,0.97,4421.65,4432.294,With that sidewalk package it was based on other Kennedy request in that process as well as a pedestrian master plan process.,127,,
575,0.97,4432.294,4438.901,Just a little bit about the projects around the Judkins park station area.,127,,
576,0.97,4438.901,4452.381,"The Trail lighting project which you can see on the left side here, through this project it was one of the top community projects identified in the study.",127,,
577,0.97,4452.381,4461.99,The Trail West of 23rd itself are Unlit and that creates a received safety issue around the station.,127,,
578,0.97,4461.99,4465.327,There has been a lot of request to upgrade that lighting.,127,,
579,0.97,4465.327,4467.729,There has been some trail access points right now.,127,,
580,0.97,4467.729,4474.503,I have a caution Signage that says use extreme caution when going through at night.,127,,
581,0.97,4474.503,4485.247,A part of that will be evaluated with parts that do need lighting and adding lighting where we know there are completely Unlit sections.,127,,
582,0.97,4485.247,4494.189,Adjacent to this project is the blue line near Hiawatha place South.,127,,
583,0.97,4494.189,4506.368,We will also provide a new staircase connection so there is currently a maintained dirt path that people have been traveling to make a quicker connection between the trail and Hiawatha place South.,127,,
584,0.97,4506.368,4510.639,Formalizing that connection with a staircase.,127,,
585,0.97,4510.639,4519.481,And south of the station we have two segments of new walkways that we will be constructing.,127,,
586,0.97,4519.481,4529.458,One on South Plum Street between 25th and am okay Junior way.,127,,
587,0.97,4529.458,4557.219,"Providing a connection between our existing sidewalk network and that facility which will also connect up to Judkins park station with the existing network in the area and then on 22nd Avenue South, Leveraging some private development happening in that area to access a new school that is down there as well as connecting to the sidewalk network, and some of the Arterials in that area.",127,,
588,0.97,4557.219,4566.895,Both of these projects are planned for construction in 2022 before the opening of the light rail station.,127,,
589,0.97,4566.895,4580.108,"The South Henderson stairway project which was the only other project funded from the southeast Seattle sidewalks and walkways project, this was a connection for pedestrian master plan process and a long- standing request of some of the neighbors in the area.",127,,
590,0.97,4580.108,4596.158,This will create a formalized connection where we have unimproved right away along South Henderson street that Woul connect the stock beacon Hill directly to Regnier Beach light rail station.,127,,
591,0.97,4596.158,4597.359,It is a steep overgrown area.,127,,
592,0.97,4597.359,4618.68,The existing Street network connection using existing streets and sidewalks in some cases would require about half mile walk around using [Indiscernible] it really opens up the station and makes transit more accessible for a lot of the neighbors.,127,,
593,0.97,4618.68,4622.551,Is this another example of a connection that is being informally used?,128,,
594,0.97,4622.551,4631.193,There is kind of a dirt path but it is steep and it gets muddy.,129,,
595,0.97,4631.193,4637.165,This project is planned for construction next year.,130,,
596,0.97,4637.165,4643.672,A little farther advanced in design.,130,,
597,0.97,4643.672,4647.042,Any questions from colleagues?,131,,
598,0.97,4647.042,4663.859,I echo Councilmember Morales's request for a full list of projects that were requested that ended up not being funded in regards to Councilmember Herbold's request having worked for the Finance chair and staff and transportation issues.,132,,
599,0.97,4663.859,4674.336,I understand that there is a historical use coming to this Committee for capital improvement project funding grant acceptance.,132,,
600,0.97,4674.336,4685.514,I do believe that putting it into the Finance Committee and Aligning it with our core is a best practice is something that I request we all look into.,132,,
601,0.97,4685.514,4689.217,Any other comments?,133,,
602,0.97,4689.217,4689.551,All right.,133,,
603,0.97,4689.551,4701.363,I would move that we adopt this or recommend that we adopt this counsel bill 119743.,133,,

605,0.97,4705.267,4709.071,All those opposed.,134,,
606,0.97,4709.071,4719.648,This item carries on to the full council counsel bill 119743.,134,,
607,0.97,4719.648,4720.248,Thank you.,134,,
608,0.97,4720.248,4729.191,Let's read the fourth item into the record.,135,,
609,0.97,4729.191,4777.572,"Counsel bill 119744. & GT; & GT; & GT; an ordinance relating to the Department of transportation's hazard mitigation program; authorizing the director of the Department of transportation to acquire, accept, and record on behalf of the city of Seattle, 11 catchment wall easements for the purpose of protecting the adjacent roadway of superficial erosion of adjacent slopes along a portion of Regnier Avenue South placing the real property rights under the jurisdiction of the Seattle Department of transportation and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.",136,,
610,0.97,4777.572,4783.478,Let's start with introductions.,137,,
611,0.97,4783.478,4783.645,,138,,
612,0.97,4783.645,4793.955,My name is Kate Lou.,139,,
613,0.97,4793.955,4794.556,Gretchen Heidel.,140,,
614,0.97,4794.556,4807.569,We are coming to you today to ask for your approval of accepting 11 easements for the Regnier Avenue South Mitigaton project.,141,,
615,0.97,4807.569,4821.583,We will be looking at the background area existing existence proposal cost duration and provide an update on the project during this presentation.,141,,
616,0.97,4821.583,4833.094,Historically there have been many landslides recorded along Rainier Avenue South between South carver Street and the South city limits resulting in debris blocking the public right away.,141,,
617,0.97,4833.094,4846.007,In 2000 Fdot [Indiscernible] Fdot commissioned the geographical survey along the corridor and determined it to be at a moderate to high risk landslide hazard.,141,,
618,0.97,4846.007,4850.946,"Given this assessment and various history of landslides, incidences.",142,,
619,0.97,4850.946,4853.281,The city believes there is a high probability of recurrence.,142,,
620,0.97,4853.281,4859.955,These landslides block sidewalks and create hazardous conditions for all modes of transportation.,142,,
621,0.97,4859.955,4868.53,In addition the city has at times had to close portions of the sidewalk.,142,,
622,0.97,4868.53,4874.002,And streets in response to public safety concerns along the impacted segments of Rainier Avenue South.,142,,
623,0.97,4874.002,4885.614,Crews have had to conduct cleanup efforts to remove debris and recover sidewalks throughout the years in response to these challenges.,142,,
624,0.97,4885.614,4899.16,"In early 2016, a 60 foot segment of retaining wall was constructed to detect a portion of Rainier South near South Perry Street as a response to two significant landslides occurring from the same slope within two weeks of each other.",142,,
625,0.97,4899.16,4901.563,Funding is now available to construct.,142,,
626,0.97,4901.563,4912.774,Infrastructure to mitigate right away due to approaching debris from the adjacent street.,142,,
627,0.97,4912.774,4929.991,This vicinity map outlines the areas along Rainier Avenue South that the project team has identified for replacement of a gravity while depending upon the slope characteristic to protect the adjacent segment of the street corridor.,142,,
628,0.97,4929.991,4944.706,This legislation ACCEPTS 11 catchment wall easements obtained by private property owners to construct and maintain the walls and places property rights under Sdot jurisdiction.,142,,
629,0.97,4944.706,4954.015,Consideration for these rights were a mutual benefit.,142,,
630,0.97,4954.015,4971.533,These pictures demonstrate existing conditions along portions of this corridor which showed debris from the adjacent slope covering the sidewalk as well as slope areas.,142,,
631,0.97,4971.533,4973.401,Two types of walls will be constructed for this project.,142,,
632,0.97,4973.401,4975.737,One type is a soldier while catch wall.,142,,
633,0.97,4975.737,4985.513,The benefits of the wall are that they retain larger volumes of debris and are suitable for a steeple slope steeper slope area.,142,,
634,0.97,4985.513,4988.35,The Wall catchment wall is the more expensive.,142,,
635,0.97,4988.35,4991.82,The other type of Wall is the gravity wall.,142,,
636,0.97,4991.82,5007.268,"The benefits of these walls are that they are more Cost- effective than the soldier pile catchment wall, they are Module and simpler to construct.",142,,
637,0.97,5007.268,5023.051,This construction work is provided under Sdot capital improvement project known as the how did this mitigation program landslide mitigation plan.,142,,
638,0.97,5023.051,5040.168,"Total cost, total budget for the project is 3.5 million and funding sources consist of the capital fund Street use cost center and gas tax.",142,,
639,0.97,5040.168,5053.982,"In preparation of project construction, city crews have cleared much of the sidewalks within the area and extended existing soldier pile wall that was constructed in 2016 and located in public right away.",142,,
640,0.97,5053.982,5065.994,"The gravity walls are anticipated to take five weeks to construct, the soldier pile catch is anticipated to take 15 weeks to construct.",142,,
641,0.97,5065.994,5080.141,It is anticipated that this project will be completed next summer 2020.,142,,
642,0.97,5080.141,5085.847,That concludes the presentation.,142,,
643,0.97,5085.847,5086.448,Any questions?,143,,
644,0.97,5086.448,5091.953,I just want to thank you for looking into this.,144,,
645,0.97,5091.953,5093.154,This is a really steep area.,144,,
646,0.97,5093.154,5094.255,It is really dangerous.,144,,
647,0.97,5094.255,5102.33,"Whenever we have heavy rains, neighbors get really worried that something like this will happen again.",144,,
648,0.97,5102.33,5117.445,"The soldier pile catchment wall is, can you share what portion or how many of the areas that you are targeting would get that versus the smaller wall?",144,,
649,0.97,5117.445,5125.687,There are four sites identified primarily dictated by just the height of the slopes themselves.,145,,
650,0.97,5125.687,5134.662,For the soldier pile walls there are four sites identified the height of those slopes are higher.,145,,
651,0.97,5134.662,5140.735,What is the degree of slope that would dictate one over the other?,146,,
652,0.97,5140.735,5152.881,"A lot of it is the height, how far it is set back from the right away and how much debris has basically flowed in that area in the past and also recommendations from a Geotech engineer.",147,,
653,0.97,5152.881,5153.414,Thank you.,148,,
654,0.97,5153.414,5157.585,Any other questions?,149,,
655,0.97,5157.585,5188.449,"In 2017 I took a little bit of a dive into the Sdot approach to landslide mitigation and I learned that, as you were Referencing in 2000, there was a citywide study done with an effort to focus on landslide mitigation in locations that would likely have significant impact because they are adjacent to hills.",150,,
656,0.97,5188.449,5200.361,There is an assessment using eight design factors at the time to determine the priority of 73 known potential landslide locations.,150,,
657,0.97,5200.361,5208.97,"Of the 73 locations that were identified, 24 were rated via high priority.",150,,
658,0.97,5208.97,5226.12,"Since 2000, Sdot had budgeted, this was as of 2017, had only budgeted $500,000 a year for his landslide mitigation.",150,,
659,0.97,5226.12,5232.76,"That $500,000 a year was intended to address these 24 High-Priority locations.",150,,
660,0.97,5232.76,5251.279,"I learned that the majority of those funds had not been used to mitigate in advance high- priority locations, it was used more in a way to respond to landslide activities.",150,,
661,0.97,5251.279,5265.827,"Of the 24 high rated locations, as of 2017, in 17 years, only seven of the 24 High-Priority location had Proactive mitigation work done.",150,,
662,0.97,5265.827,5284.545,In 2017 I worked the budget office and Sdot to use the supplemental budget process to Prioritize and additional $1.3 million to address some of those High-Priority locations.,150,,
663,0.97,5284.545,5294.656,You guys did a great job of doing this work on a number of locations.,150,,
664,0.97,5294.656,5298.359,Some of them in district 1.,150,,
665,0.97,5298.359,5302.93,Thank you on behalf of my constituents.,150,,
666,0.97,5302.93,5319.681,The commitment was made at that time that we were going to try to figure out how to begin to address this backlog and make sure we were not budgeting only sufficient funds to address landslide activities rather than mitigating the likelihood of landslides.,150,,
667,0.97,5319.681,5332.46,"I am just wondering, I have not checked in on this issue recently, I would be interested to learn how we are going to get to those High-Priority locations.",150,,
668,0.97,5332.46,5341.002,"I am guessing that 2000 study was done 20 years ago, there might be different priorities now as well.",150,,
669,0.97,5341.002,5346.474,Thank you for the support for the program.,151,,
670,0.97,5346.474,5355.817,"I do not manage that piece of the program, that is something we can follow up with in terms of how to reassess priorities from that list from 2000.",151,,
671,0.97,5355.817,5368.83,How we are assessing the parties and also ensuring that we are identifying sufficient budget so that it is actually mitigation program instead of a response program.,152,,
672,0.97,5368.83,5369.23,Thank you.,153,,
673,0.97,5369.23,5382.477,Thank you Councilmember Herbold we can asked that they bring that right into committee to discuss and the budgetary implications we hope to see in the supplemental budget in the future.,153,,
674,0.97,5382.477,5385.78,Any other questions or comments?,153,,
675,0.97,5385.78,5390.651,"This is a question that I do not need the answer today, it would be helpful and follow-up.",154,,
676,0.97,5390.651,5400.728,There is inherent value that is provided to the adjacent land owners and who we are purchasing these easements from as we are increasing stability of the lot that they own.,154,,
677,0.97,5400.728,5407.835,Is that factored into the cost that we are provided when purchasing this land?,154,,
678,0.97,5407.835,5410.671,To some extent it is.,155,,
679,0.97,5410.671,5419.247,We have to realize that what we are doing right now is really protect the public right away access and not necessarily the owners.,155,,
680,0.97,5419.247,5428.156,There are still superficial slides that would occur and that is the property owner responsibility and not the city.,155,,
681,0.97,5428.156,5432.994,One thing we are trying to address is not use public money for a private benefit.,155,,
682,0.97,5432.994,5438.9,All of the walls were designed at this point in time as a public Right-Of-Way.,155,,
683,0.97,5438.9,5446.808,"Either way whether the intent is either to protect the public right away, there is inherent benefit.",156,,
684,0.97,5446.808,5447.608,Yes.,157,,
685,0.97,5447.608,5455.983,Are we able to put that into the purchase agreement?,158,,
686,0.97,5455.983,5456.384,We try.,159,,
687,0.97,5456.384,5463.691,A lot of these have real property requirements in terms of compensating for Ministry of cost to get the easements.,159,,
688,0.97,5463.691,5470.431,That is a discuss and that we typically have with the private owners in terms of the benefit they would get from the wall.,159,,
689,0.97,5470.431,5475.136,This is an example of where getting the easements in exchange for the benefit to the property.,160,,
690,0.97,5475.136,5478.639,We are not paying cash for the easements.,160,,
691,0.97,5478.639,5488.249,Thank you.,161,,
692,0.97,5488.249,5488.649,Thank you.,162,,
693,0.97,5488.649,5491.986,Any other questions or comments?,162,,
694,0.97,5491.986,5494.355,Moving on this particular project.,162,,
695,0.97,5494.355,5504.165,"I would like to move recommending passage of counsel bill 119744, those in favor indicate.",162,,
696,0.97,5504.165,5509.17,Thank you for the second.,162,,
697,0.97,5509.17,5513.875,In favor raise your hand by saying aye.,162,,
698,0.97,5513.875,5514.275,Any against?,162,,
699,0.97,5514.275,5514.509,Great.,162,,
700,0.97,5514.509,5517.278,That item carries forward.,162,,
701,0.97,5517.278,5521.182,Thank you everybody.,162,,
702,0.97,5521.182,5525.086,Unless there are further comments.,162,,
703,0.97,5525.086,5529.891,"Is my final comment, chair.",163,,
704,0.97,5529.891,5533.761,I think you for being prepared and ready to start at 9:30.,163,,
705,0.97,5533.761,5535.997,It was my fault but I was not here on time.,163,,
706,0.97,5535.997,5536.797,Kudos to the chair.,163,,
707,0.97,5536.797,5538.199,Thank you very much.,163,,
708,0.97,5538.199,5546.34,Thank you for the great questions and the constant oversight of these large departments.,164,,
709,0.97,5546.34,5553.481,"I think that concludes our February 19, 2020 meeting of the transportation utilities committee meeting.",164,,
710,0.97,5553.481,5553.915,Thank you.,164,,
