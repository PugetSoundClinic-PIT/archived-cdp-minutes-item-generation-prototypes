132,0.97,864.73,880.579,The benefits team wanted to increase the amount of content and by individuals so they selected a number of videos on Rsj topic.,30,,
133,0.97,880.579,886.352,They found that it was more equitable for white people from the start of the program.,30,,
134,0.97,886.352,895.894,The unit implemented the content but included communication acknowledging it wasn't for their current audience.,30,,
135,0.97,895.894,904.803,They worked on part two for tools that would reach the intended audience and that's still in process.,30,,
136,0.97,904.803,924.657,"Second, Hsr hr business partner who is provide hr services for small departments and offices decided to create a procedural program for themselves and other hr practitioners program wide.",30,,

139,0.97,942.141,946.412,Is something you the Council members may be familiar with.,30,,
140,0.97,946.412,948.213,The civil service project.,30,,
141,0.97,948.213,955.754,They decided to create a request form for civil service exemption during the classification process.,30,,
142,0.97,955.754,972.104,The team provided feed back that the land could not be satisfied by a form alone so class moved forward with creating another project team to create a Moredetailed guidance for the project that also included Theadvisor to dig deeper into the question.,30,,
143,0.97,972.104,977.676,That part of the project is still in process.,30,,
144,0.97,977.676,980.946,"Finally, there's a deferred complex site.",30,,
145,0.97,980.946,984.416,Due to their vendor implementing a new version.,30,,
146,0.97,984.416,997.696,Deferred con created a concrete to make sure changes would not have marginalized conversation.,30,,
147,0.97,997.696,1005.537,Based on equity based received they were able to implement several different changes to the Website including adding closed Captioning to videos.,30,,
148,0.97,1005.537,1007.973,Working making sure the Website would work with screen readers.,30,,
149,0.97,1007.973,1015.514,And they are also in the process of offering a full Spanish language translation of the Website.,30,,
150,0.97,1015.514,1031.663,"All right, and now, turn it back over to Pam for talking about the other things that we did with racial equity tool kits.",30,,
151,0.97,1031.663,1031.93,Slide.,30,,
152,0.97,1031.93,1039.838,After hearing many concerns about our racial equity cool kit forms the change team took on the process of Redesigning them.,31,,
153,0.97,1039.838,1049.415,"Our goal was to make the forms simpler, more user friendly and a guided experience that's more focused on a racial equity outcome.",31,,
154,0.97,1049.415,1053.786,Keeping in mind that many units within Hsr don't deal directly with the public.,31,,
155,0.97,1053.786,1064.663,We engage stake holders by meeting with staff during multiple sessions to go over the revised form.,31,,
156,0.97,1064.663,1066.799,We host a targeted workshops.,31,,
157,0.97,1066.799,1071.804,"Facilitated, learning and development forms and the new change team advisor program.",31,,
158,0.97,1071.804,1085.417,"Our goal was to implement a process for intentionally starting and working on a program, policy or project from an equity centered perspective.",31,,
159,0.97,1085.417,1088.954,Slide please.,31,,
160,0.97,1088.954,1094.46,Our change team introduced the advisory program since 2021 and tonight we advise on eight projects.,31,,
161,0.97,1094.46,1101.233,The need was born out of a few factors we observed from past racial equity reviews.,31,,
162,0.97,1101.233,1106.705,First we are seeing that the team was not being engaged early enough in the process.,31,,
163,0.97,1106.705,1111.41,Many individuals struggled with identifying a racial equity outcome.,31,,
164,0.97,1111.41,1118.851,"Second, project roots and our team saw the equity reviews as a burden to their process instead of a part of the process.",31,,
165,0.97,1118.851,1125.924,"Third, the time limits of change team back was negatively impact.",31,,
166,0.97,1125.924,1136.568,At least two advisors meet one on one with a project group to answer specific questions about completing an R.E.T.,31,,
167,0.97,1136.568,1143.675,And check in if the project continues to move forward with that goal.,31,,
168,0.97,1143.675,1145.611,And make decisions with the change team.,31,,
169,0.97,1145.611,1156.555,Using advisors from the change team has created a great Avenue to engage the team on smaller projects that would not necessarily warrant an entire review by the whole team.,31,,
170,0.97,1156.555,1160.859,The program has been very successfully combined with the R.E.T.,31,,
171,0.97,1160.859,1168.8,"Training program and revised forms in having higher quality, racial equity reviews that include racial equity outcomes.",31,,
172,0.97,1168.8,1184.116,Additionally this has led to earlier engagement with the change team where feed back is being implemented and used on change teams.,31,,
173,0.97,1184.116,1186.919,Now Felicia Caldwell will discuss over accomplishments.,31,,
174,0.97,1186.919,1200.432,The work force equity team was created in 2015 in response to executive order in 215 O two work force initiative Andcouncil resolution.,32,,
175,0.97,1200.432,1204.87,However equity has always been a strategy for racial social justice.,32,,
176,0.97,1204.87,1214.613,The team developed the first work force equity strategic plan which I'm sure President Gonzalez will remember very well.,32,,
177,0.97,1214.613,1221.153,Created that same plan with the definition you see here in 2016.,32,,
178,0.97,1221.153,1232.264,That plan included multiple strategies and is Overseen by we pack the work force equity planning and advisory committee.,32,,
179,0.97,1232.264,1243.642,Which is an Idt chaired by Sdhr directors.,32,,
180,0.97,1243.642,1243.976,In addition.,32,,
181,0.97,1243.976,1246.545,Executive orders has continued to Strenghten the team.,32,,
182,0.97,1246.545,1254.953,The Idt who created change for this area included Council members as well.,32,,
183,0.97,1254.953,1255.687,Next slide.,32,,
184,0.97,1255.687,1266.465,Since work force equity connects to our larger Isj work we wanted to share with you some brief information about the strategic plan before moving into our accomplishments.,32,,
185,0.97,1266.465,1267.966,So where are we?,32,,
186,0.97,1267.966,1274.106,After five years we know that generally females are under represented throughout the city.,32,,
187,0.97,1274.106,1291.023,"That as a city, our work force is representative of employees over all but, by Poc employees are under represented at the top levels of supervisors and wage earners.",32,,
188,0.97,1291.023,1295.093,Latin X are the Mostunrepresented group across the entire work force.,32,,
189,0.97,1295.093,1303.068,Bipoc women are most under represented at the top levels of pay and supervisory authority.,32,,
190,0.97,1303.068,1305.07,Men of color continue to be Overrepresented in discipline.,32,,
191,0.97,1305.07,1313.111,And we had a very strange thing that has proven to be consistent.,32,,
192,0.97,1313.111,1319.651,"Except for Asians, Bipoc employees are far less likely to get a performance rating of exceeds expectations.",32,,
193,0.97,1319.651,1323.321,So what have we learned and what do we plan to do?,32,,
194,0.97,1323.321,1326.491,We are definitely going to be more data driven.,32,,
195,0.97,1326.491,1331.029,We have improved our data collection and are still doing so.,32,,
196,0.97,1331.029,1339.538,"We are employee driven, we are meeting with several employee engagement sessions and surveys and other ways to reach out to employees.",32,,
197,0.97,1339.538,1347.679,We plan to concentrate on two to four major strategies instead of 12 or 15.,32,,
198,0.97,1347.679,1358.89,We hope to redefine work force equity with more of a racial lens.,32,,
199,0.97,1358.89,1368.934,The new work force equities work force equity strategic plan for approval and adoption.,32,,
200,0.97,1368.934,1369.701,Next slide please.,32,,
201,0.97,1369.701,1372.237,"So what did we accomplish, this is just a sample.",32,,
202,0.97,1372.237,1380.912,It's not our entire list when I sent out the request for Rsjaccomplishments I got five pages from within our Department.,32,,
203,0.97,1380.912,1383.515,So we're really proud that we've been doing a lot of work.,32,,
204,0.97,1383.515,1391.456,But we don't have time to Shareeverything in depth so we'll highlight a couple of areas.,32,,
205,0.97,1391.456,1391.89,Next slide please.,32,,
206,0.97,1391.89,1408.874,"So one of the things I want to highlight here is this, sorry, so we have a different, I want to apologize first off for that.",32,,
207,0.97,1408.874,1410.008,These are all accomplishments that are correct.,32,,
208,0.97,1410.008,1412.944,But I want to add a couple more.,32,,
209,0.97,1412.944,1429.394,One is that we have an a to Z investigation checklist that was created by the human resources investigation unit and remember that was one of the things that came out of the anti Harassment investigation recommendations.,32,,
210,0.97,1429.394,1436.868,And they've created a checklist that essentially went through a tool kit.,32,,
211,0.97,1436.868,1449.614,And city wide investigations and to include trauma informed and emotionally literal techniques.,32,,
212,0.97,1449.614,1450.449,As well as R.E.T.,32,,
213,0.97,1450.449,1451.683,Approved documents.,32,,
214,0.97,1451.683,1468.233,The same thing we're able to do the investigation unit is they actually provide focused investigation training every month to hr employees who do investigations in their Department and these are all employee investigations.,32,,
215,0.97,1468.233,1478.443,"And this training was geared toward ensuring that employee voices aren't silenced and that the concerns are in fact, elevated to Hriu.",32,,
216,0.97,1478.443,1480.979,And I'm not going to read through all of these.,32,,
217,0.97,1480.979,1498.997,I'm hoping that you can just read quickly kind of some of the things that we're working on with that.,32,,
218,0.97,1498.997,1499.831,Next slide please.,32,,
219,0.97,1499.831,1500.632,More accomplishments.,32,,
220,0.97,1500.632,1512.444,When Covid hit our employees were in danger to lose their jobs because there wasn't anybody to supervise them or their jobs would have changed drastically during this time.,32,,
221,0.97,1512.444,1527.826,We were able to redesign every security role to meet the changing work environment and to safeguard their Joband that so many of the departments we wouldn't be able to support them at the time.,32,,
222,0.97,1527.826,1533.832,Another thing that I would like to highlight is the police officers examinations.,32,,
223,0.97,1533.832,1545.176,We've added a section to the examinations for in coming or for first time police officers coming into the city.,32,,
224,0.97,1545.176,1550.415,And this exam actually increases access to applicants and provides and equity lens on the exam.,32,,
225,0.97,1550.415,1554.786,So what does that look like?,32,,
226,0.97,1554.786,1566.665,It's now screening for bias and group think amongst other subjects.,32,,
227,0.97,1566.665,1567.098,It's pretty new.,32,,
228,0.97,1567.098,1570.302,How different it may be.,32,,
229,0.97,1570.302,1574.573,And it seems to be increasing the people of color passing the exam.,32,,
230,0.97,1574.573,1580.312,The next one I would like to highlight is the city budget accountability.,32,,
231,0.97,1580.312,1594.225,Wepac has been Partnering with racial social justice program and CDL in order to have a better equity lens on budget request.,32,,
232,0.97,1594.225,1594.659,Next slide please.,32,,
233,0.97,1594.659,1601.666,Another thing I would like to highlight is the leadership expectation and accountability plan assessment and tools.,32,,
234,0.97,1601.666,1617.949,This came about because when we did the initial strategic plan we did a lot of interviews and everyone agreed that leaders should be held accountable to Rsj.,32,,
235,0.97,1617.949,1621.753,And most people agreed they didn't know how to make that happen.,32,,
236,0.97,1621.753,1638.436,So Wepac took this on and actually created a tool that will help city leaders increase their knowledge of work force equity and Rsji and Developskills to disrupt institutional racism.,32,,
237,0.97,1638.436,1639.337,Next page please.,32,,
238,0.97,1639.337,1647.679,It has seven competency areas that are listed here and every single one has great detail about what it takes to show up as an equitable leader.,32,,
239,0.97,1647.679,1660.425,So the I don't know how to do this or what this would look like is no longer an option if they have this tool available to them.,32,,
240,0.97,1660.425,1668.099,"It gives you very, very detailed look at each of these places.",32,,
241,0.97,1668.099,1668.433,Next slide.,32,,
242,0.97,1668.433,1671.036,It includes a competency overview.,32,,
243,0.97,1671.036,1672.003,That's where all of the descriptions are.,32,,
244,0.97,1672.003,1693.291,An assessment to find out where you are right now and an action plan how are you going to communicate with your Department how you're doing in this Areathen it includes lots of links and resources for the director.,32,,
245,0.97,1693.291,1704.135,And this is designed for a director position in the Department.,32,,
246,0.97,1704.135,1712.544,There are a few departments have the stool that could be Valuableto all areas of the city.,32,,
247,0.97,1712.544,1715.447,"So city wide, the hr leaders sponsor communities of hr practice.",32,,
248,0.97,1715.447,1720.351,And so this is the hr leaders who are out in the departments.,32,,
249,0.97,1720.351,1735.066,And the goal for these are to create accountability in the hr space to create experiences of Bipoc employees leading to excellent work experiences for all.,32,,
250,0.97,1735.066,1757.889,"And although these are communities of practice are sponsored by the hr leaders, the work tools who are putting together programs and processes and recommendations for policies include hr and Nonhr employees city wide.",32,,
251,0.97,1757.889,1760.291,We are to know from customers what we're doing.,32,,
252,0.97,1760.291,1761.526,Some of them are meeting.,32,,
253,0.97,1761.526,1763.928,"Some are ending this year, they've been going all year.",32,,
254,0.97,1763.928,1776.908,One of the things we're really looking forward to is to create this annual hr forum but as you can imagine this year it was kind of hard to get to that.,32,,
255,0.97,1776.908,1777.408,Next slide please.,32,,
256,0.97,1777.408,1789.087,So one of the approaching we're taking to do equity work in HSI and other places in the city is now this equity center design.,32,,
257,0.97,1789.087,1800.598,It is a practice of purposefully involving Minortized communities throughout the design process with the goal of allowing their voices to directly affect how the solution will address the inequity at hand.,32,,
258,0.97,1800.598,1818.75,It's focused on oppressed groups that are the most impacted by the project and really important to read distribution of power and sharing creations process implementation and creation.,32,,
259,0.97,1818.75,1820.451,Next slide.,32,,
260,0.97,1820.451,1836.467,Did the slide move and I didn't see it?,32,,
261,0.97,1837.202,1847.645,I think our it got bumped.,33,,
262,0.97,1849.614,1850.181,Not a good thing.,33,,
263,0.97,1850.181,1851.849,We will try to log back in.,33,,
264,0.97,1851.849,1853.818,I have a couple more slides.,34,,
265,0.97,1853.818,1860.692,I think I'll be able to get through without reading any of these.,34,,
266,0.97,1860.692,1866.264,The other thing we're using is using relational culture.,34,,
267,0.97,1866.264,1868.533,In many overlapping access of life.,34,,
268,0.97,1868.533,1877.976,"In a way to allow us to be honest about truth tension, Disconnection, pain, possibility, care and change.",34,,
269,0.97,1877.976,1889.22,So that we can all act together.,34,,
270,0.97,1889.22,1906.137,The Socr Rsj team has created a letter that shows what is coming.,34,,
271,0.97,1906.137,1916.614,We figured out many of these are experienced by but not exclusive to Seattle human resources.,34,,
272,0.97,1916.614,1919.417,Key leadership and staff turn over.,34,,
273,0.97,1919.417,1926.691,There's so much staff turn over and leadership turnover.,34,,
274,0.97,1926.691,1930.728,"With Covid-19, many have had to jump on it.",34,,
275,0.97,1930.728,1935.099,Some of it brought on by Covid but some normal.,34,,
276,0.97,1935.099,1940.638,Acknowledgment of issues but lack of commitment to change.,34,,
277,0.97,1940.638,1957.889,"This is one we were actually able to give out and we get back, I don't have time.",34,,
278,0.97,1957.889,1972.971,We've always been greatly impacted by Rsj staffing because we work so closely.,34,,
279,0.97,1972.971,1989.887,Infrastructure especially for Bipoc women.,34,,
280,0.97,1989.887,2003.768,And Prioritizedand finally I want to talk a little bit about workplace racial equity and social justice.,34,,
281,0.97,2003.768,2014.846,"How do we create space for people to share their reflections, anger, fear, their joy those kind of things.",34,,
282,0.97,2014.846,2021.352,And we've done it in some ways by employees that were brought it to us throughout the year.,34,,
283,0.97,2021.352,2029.66,Supervisors say what does it look like to have a supervisor in some space.,34,,
284,0.97,2029.66,2043.074,We created supervisor studio for people in the city that's doing well in one area or the other and we created these videos that can be used in learning or development or just to view.,34,,
285,0.97,2043.074,2045.743,We have meditations in a burning house.,34,,
286,0.97,2045.743,2047.678,I thought that was the most interesting title.,34,,
287,0.97,2047.678,2054.552,A three part workshop for women of color that was essentially teaching Self-Care.,34,,
288,0.97,2054.552,2057.889,What do you do to make sure you're okay.,34,,

362,0.97,2539.069,2543.874,"Director handy, welcome.",46,,
363,0.97,2543.874,2545.009,Thank you.,47,,
364,0.97,2545.009,2553.217,At this time we would like to walk you through the 15 amounts that have been introduced today.,47,,
365,0.97,2553.217,2561.559,Fourteen AMENDS to the Council rules and the ones we're going to discuss are in addition to that.,47,,
366,0.97,2561.559,2566.764,I will invite if they have Connectivity to on screen and if not I can do so.,47,,
367,0.97,2566.764,2571.001,She is back in action so she is able to share screen.,48,,
368,0.97,2571.001,2571.535,There we go.,48,,
369,0.97,2571.535,2575.606,We have it up on the screen.,48,,
370,0.97,2575.606,2577.274,Take it away director handy.,48,,
371,0.97,2577.274,2577.741,Great.,49,,
372,0.97,2577.741,2578.642,"Just before so, really quickly here.",50,,
373,0.97,2578.642,2589.019,"What we're going to do because I want to make sure that we're, we're all on the same page about what's going to happen here.",50,,
374,0.97,2589.019,2593.691,Because each one of these are amendments.,50,,
375,0.97,2593.691,2603.4,"What we will do is have you present on an item and then, and then I think probably because there's so many of them.",50,,
376,0.97,2603.4,2608.706,The best process I think is to take them one by one.,50,,
377,0.97,2608.706,2614.078,Otherwise we will have forgotten by the time we get to number 15.,50,,
378,0.97,2614.078,2615.012,What number one was.,50,,
379,0.97,2615.012,2623.554,So Council members who are off camera just be aware that we will take each amendment one by one.,50,,
380,0.97,2623.554,2642.573,"We will hear a presentation on said amendment from director handy and other Council central staff members and then we will, we will make motions to allow for us to have debate discussion about an amendment and then we will vote on the amendment individually.",50,,
381,0.97,2642.573,2643.941,So just realized I had forgotten to lay that out.,50,,
382,0.97,2643.941,2650.848,So I'm going to hand it over to director handy to kick us off with amendment one.,50,,
383,0.97,2650.848,2653.417,That sounds good.,51,,
384,0.97,2653.417,2658.689,And I will do a description of the amendments.,51,,
385,0.97,2658.689,2664.661,Lots of technical questions for them and the city clerks as well.,51,,
386,0.97,2664.661,2665.529,As we get into discussion.,51,,
387,0.97,2665.529,2674.104,"And amendment one, if you feel free to move to that point.",51,,
388,0.97,2674.104,2682.079,This amendment would eliminate the alternate positions on the current committees.,51,,
389,0.97,2682.079,2687.418,Standing committees will have four members and an alternate.,51,,
390,0.97,2687.418,2692.256,Committee members are able to attend during their absence.,51,,
391,0.97,2692.256,2708.772,Their resolution 32029 as was drafted makes a change to the section standing committees will have at least four members and may have an alternate.,51,,
392,0.97,2708.772,2710.24,So makes the alternate permissive.,51,,
393,0.97,2710.24,2721.819,"Great, so colleagues again as a reminder we are on.",52,,
394,0.97,2721.819,2729.46,So here are amendments one for colleagues in the committee meeting.,52,,
395,0.97,2729.46,2733.03,We're on amendment one.,52,,
396,0.97,2733.03,2738.936,This amendment is sponsored by Council member Pedersen as agreed to the process.,52,,
397,0.97,2738.936,2751.682,I agreed to process those amendments for Noncommittee members to allow for discussion in today's committee meeting.,52,,
398,0.97,2751.682,2760.557,I'm going to move to amend resolution 32029 as presented on amendment one on the agenda.,52,,
399,0.97,2760.557,2765.696,Is there a second?,52,,
400,0.97,2765.696,2766.096,Second.,53,,
401,0.97,2766.096,2766.53,Second so much.,54,,
402,0.97,2766.53,2773.27,The amendment has been moved and Seconded.,54,,
403,0.97,2773.27,2778.275,To move amendment one.,54,,
404,0.97,2778.275,2793.29,"Council member Pedersen I'm going to go ahead and recognize you to address the amendment then we will open it up for comments, questions and debate.",54,,
405,0.97,2793.29,2794.925,Thank you Council president and chair.,55,,
406,0.97,2794.925,2795.959,Appreciate this.,55,,
407,0.97,2795.959,2806.136,"I want to thank the working group, the internal working group who met several times to discuss these rules and clerks office.",55,,
408,0.97,2806.136,2812.943,Council President's office and thank you Council President Gonzalez for enabling this space and time.,55,,
409,0.97,2812.943,2828.525,We're not members of the government committee and even for putting your name on certain things that you might not be voting for today but just move the process along really appreciate that grace and leadership.,55,,
410,0.97,2828.525,2831.094,And so this one is eliminate the alternate position.,55,,
411,0.97,2831.094,2849.78,I think it made sense last couple of years to Institute that as we set a really firm membership of committees to be in a very safe harbor with the public meetings act.,55,,
412,0.97,2849.78,2853.083,And having an alternate there as needed.,55,,
413,0.97,2853.083,2869.8,"The way I've seen it unfold over the last couple of years just in practice is alternates often, some of the items on the committee may be a bit needy.",55,,
414,0.97,2869.8,2871.602,Sometimes three days is not enough.,55,,
415,0.97,2871.602,2887.684,Sometimes we're not getting sufficient notice to read everything and come up as prepared as the regular members because of when we're notified.,55,,
416,0.97,2887.684,2889.319,The general public doesn't differentiate between an alternate.,55,,
417,0.97,2889.319,2900.764,"When the voting is happening and you see the photos of all the members there the alternates included it looks like we're missing, we're not as prepared.",55,,
418,0.97,2900.764,2907.905,The Quorum requirement is three members out of five.,55,,
419,0.97,2907.905,2913.51,And having an alternate that makes an additional member.,55,,
420,0.97,2913.51,2918.882,If one of them is absent is okay.,55,,
421,0.97,2918.882,2923.453,And Council member is eating up Quorum to have a robust committee.,55,,
422,0.97,2923.453,2927.057,"It's okay if it's not, sometimes there's a 2-2 tie.",55,,
423,0.97,2927.057,2930.06,Things could still be pulled forward to the full council.,55,,
424,0.97,2930.06,2941.371,"I do appreciate the working group making the change to have it a, the alternate be discretionary as committees are formed for the next two years.",55,,
425,0.97,2941.371,2949.112,"I think for simplicity, it would be great to just eliminate position is.",55,,
426,0.97,2949.112,2953.15,Thank you so much Council member Pedersen.,56,,
427,0.97,2953.15,2970.167,Are there any comments or questions from colleagues or additional information to provide from Council member Herbold.,56,,
428,0.97,2970.167,2985.515,Thank you Council member Gonzalez and thank you as well for Noncommittee members.,57,,
429,0.97,2985.515,2990.087,I can think of one possible Unintented consequence of this amendment.,57,,
430,0.97,2990.087,2999.529,"And I don't want to, I don't want to inflate the likelihood of this unintended consequence.",57,,
431,0.97,2999.529,3013.41,"I can think of like for instance somebody might have a committee member, a regular committee member might have a planned absence.",57,,
432,0.97,3013.41,3019.716,And everybody knows in advance.,57,,
433,0.97,3019.716,3021.485,And say that's the fifth committee member.,57,,
434,0.97,3021.485,3028.558,"Or it's the fourth, I guess Maybe that isn't a problem if there's a committee.",57,,
435,0.97,3028.558,3042.539,I'm worried about a planned absence and a sickness that is unplanned and how that might impact the ability to meet Quorum.,57,,
436,0.97,3042.539,3056.186,"But, again I don't know that would happen that often and with a committee of five you would still even under that circumstance have a Quorum of three.",57,,
437,0.97,3056.186,3057.254,But I'm just wondering.,57,,
438,0.97,3057.254,3078.575,Given that the work group made a recommendation allowing the existence of an alternate to be permissive based on a committee chair's preference.,57,,
439,0.97,3078.575,3091.054,"What other consideration, opposed to Council member Pederson's presence in this amendment.",57,,
440,0.97,3091.054,3091.288,Thanks.,57,,
441,0.97,3091.288,3093.757,Go ahead director handy.,58,,
442,0.97,3093.757,3099.596,Great I'm happy to respond to that and invite the city clerk to add anything else.,59,,
443,0.97,3099.596,3114.611,We did have a discussion about the current practices that there are five members on Standingcommittees and that provides an eligibility for two to be absent before you accept a Quorum of three.,59,,
444,0.97,3114.611,3138.535,"Committee shall have at least four and the intention of the working group was that there would be flexibility provided the Council when establishing committees that if they were going to establish some committees that were smaller, that include four you may want to include an alternate on those committees such as if one person was absent you would have Quorum.",59,,
445,0.97,3138.535,3144.341,But if two Council members Wereabsent you would not.,59,,
446,0.97,3144.341,3165.695,"We are thinking, I don't think we have a lot of more specific scenarios that we sort of worked through who we thought making it permissive would relieve the.",59,,
447,0.97,3165.695,3184.614,So would the sponsor of this amendment be Amendable to including language that limits the elimination of alternates to those committees that have five members.,60,,
448,0.97,3184.614,3190.654,"Because, director handy I think your description of a four member committee is exactly what I was thinking of.",60,,
449,0.97,3190.654,3192.589,With the planned absence.,60,,
450,0.97,3192.589,3197.527,"It's on the books, but then somebody is out sick ineffectively.",60,,
451,0.97,3197.527,3210.14,You have to cancel that meeting if you can't get that alternate there.,60,,
452,0.97,3210.14,3218.949,President Gonzalez.,61,,
453,0.97,3218.949,3220.116,Yes go ahead.,62,,
454,0.97,3220.116,3229.492,And if there was a four member committee.,63,,
455,0.97,3229.492,3237.467,I also want to acknowledge that the content we're talking about right now since absence in its entirety from a committee meeting.,64,,
456,0.97,3237.467,3242.572,There are instances in which Council members are simply late or tardy.,64,,
457,0.97,3242.572,3248.578,"And in those instances, there is impact as well.",64,,
458,0.97,3248.578,3256.519,You know it is not uncommon for me as Council President to receive several notices a week about needing to leave early.,64,,
459,0.97,3256.519,3261.324,About needing to arrive up to 30 minutes late.,64,,
460,0.97,3261.324,3293.823,"Or you know, or only being able to attend sort of X you know from X, Y, Z time to X, Y, Z time when you're dealing with those razor thin margins that does call into question, about whether you start with Quorum and lose Quorum during the meeting.",64,,
461,0.97,3293.823,3306.136,There's questions about if take action in which you don't have Quorum is Compliant with the rules and continue to move through the legislative process.,64,,
462,0.97,3306.136,3311.107,I just want to be mindful of that.,64,,
463,0.97,3311.107,3323.053,"And so I don't think that the, because I'm concerned about sort of those instances that I've just described those scenarios I just described.",64,,
464,0.97,3323.053,3335.532,I'm not sure the revision being proposed by Council member Herbold to Council member Pederson's amendment goes.,64,,
465,0.97,3335.532,3357.087,That's why I was leaning toward the recommendation from the work group that allows the President to have the discuss about whether or not to have an alternate base on the committee composition including who the Council members are and the number of Council members serving on each committee.,64,,
466,0.97,3357.087,3374.204,And I would encourage us to allow for that discretion to be exercised by the Council President.,64,,
467,0.97,3374.204,3396.593,"As opposed to being more perspective in this instance, but I do think that even in the instance of four committee members included in the base resolution.",64,,
468,0.97,3396.593,3409.706,You either choose to the composition of the size of the committee.,64,,
469,0.97,3409.706,3419.082,Sorry Council President I'm not sure where the best place to insert this is.,65,,
470,0.97,3419.082,3420.95,Food for thought.,65,,
471,0.97,3420.95,3426.256,I think four members of a committee is not Buena idea.,65,,
472,0.97,3426.256,3430.093,I think that would constantly lead to having a tie.,65,,
473,0.97,3430.093,3437.6,"I would be interested in this amendment assuming we keep five members of the, five members on a committee.",65,,
474,0.97,3437.6,3441.838,And I look forward to hearing more about this.,65,,
475,0.97,3441.838,3448.445,"Yeah, I do want to sort of go back to sort of the discussion around having five members in the first place.",66,,
476,0.97,3448.445,3459.255,The whole point was to make sure that there were an actual recommendation of all committees.,66,,
477,0.97,3459.255,3477.674,So that the full Council and Noncommittee members who have the benefit of an actual committee Recommendationwe've seen some instances in which there is a 2-2 divided folks on the committee.,66,,
478,0.97,3477.674,3515.245,"And in those instances it has been a struggle to for Noncommittee members to sort of catch up and figure out why there's so much division amongst the committee and so, you know sort of just thinking through the number of members on a committee was sort of rooted in wanting to have an opportunity for a majority of the city Council to signal to the full council its support or lack of support for a particular legislative proposal.",66,,
479,0.97,3515.245,3518.214,Whether it was a resolution or an Ordnance.,66,,
480,0.97,3518.214,3518.915,Council member Strauss.,66,,
481,0.97,3518.915,3525.521,Thank you Council President.,67,,
482,0.97,3525.521,3526.923,And thank you Council member Pederson.,67,,
483,0.97,3526.923,3532.362,Just for bringing Thisforward.,67,,
484,0.97,3532.362,3538.902,I just want to express my support if we have five members in a committee.,67,,
485,0.97,3538.902,3539.569,Short and sweet.,67,,
486,0.97,3539.569,3551.781,One of the changes under lined in this resolution says a committee member must be absent for the entire meeting for the alternate to attend and have full voting rights.,68,,
487,0.97,3551.781,3559.222,So the alternate can still sit in and take part of the discussion but that's one related change that's an under lined resolution.,68,,
488,0.97,3559.222,3561.19,Thank you.,69,,
489,0.97,3561.19,3563.626,Director handy for bringing that up.,69,,
490,0.97,3563.626,3578.174,"I think the issue where this comes up, you know to head is around sort of whether you can start a committee meeting or whether any lose Quorum.",69,,
491,0.97,3578.174,3586.082,There are implications to compliance with the rules in terms of the actions that you are taking.,69,,
492,0.97,3586.082,3590.52,"So, Yeah.",69,,
493,0.97,3590.52,3591.454,Are there any other comments or questions?,69,,
494,0.97,3591.454,3596.793,Council member Mosqueda go ahead.,69,,
495,0.97,3596.793,3606.135,Thanks Council President.,70,,
496,0.97,3606.135,3613.643,I look for you to provide Intel to craft.,70,,
497,0.97,3613.643,3618.014,If our hope is to have a five member committee.,70,,
498,0.97,3618.014,3628.625,There's the chance that someone is potentially sick or on leave.,70,,
499,0.97,3628.625,3645.241,We run the risk of having a four person committee and a vote of 2-2. I'm also hoping to have a five member committee and appreciated the I think the rational for the amendment to begin with.,70,,
500,0.97,3645.241,3654.384,Now I'm a little bit torn because I do want to make sure we're not ending with a divisive vote as much a possible.,70,,
501,0.97,3654.384,3657.954,And there's thoughts about that.,71,,
502,0.97,3657.954,3668.631,I had very much appreciated where the sponsors are coming from and really interested in keeping the ability to have five people there and if that requires us to have an alternate.,71,,
503,0.97,3668.631,3672.201,Then I'll be interested in hearing what other folks thoughts are on that.,71,,
504,0.97,3672.201,3683.713,Because I can see the benefit of keeping an alternate if that's our ultimate goal.,71,,
505,0.97,3683.713,3685.982,Council member Strauss please.,72,,
506,0.97,3685.982,3698.661,Just signaling Council member Mosqueda Resonating with me about this extended leave.,73,,
507,0.97,3698.661,3698.928,Sharing.,73,,
508,0.97,3698.928,3702.231,Got it.,73,,
509,0.97,3702.231,3706.502,"Okay, so folks I think there are a couple of options here.",74,,
510,0.97,3706.502,3714.51,The first option is to Acceptthe amendment as presented.,74,,
511,0.97,3714.51,3722.819,Which would entirely eliminate an alternate regardless of the number of members on a committee.,74,,
512,0.97,3722.819,3730.193,"Option two, is to make an amendment to amendment one.",74,,
513,0.97,3730.193,3742.939,That would require that the elimination of an alternate would only apply to committees of five Council members.,74,,
514,0.97,3742.939,3754.317,Opening up the question of I suppose that insinuates there would be committees of less than five members.,74,,
515,0.97,3754.317,3761.858,And option and then option three or I guess there wasn't an option three.,74,,
516,0.97,3761.858,3763.993,Those were the two options.,74,,
517,0.97,3763.993,3765.061,So we have option one.,74,,
518,0.97,3765.061,3774.103,Vote on amendment one as written which is a complete elimination of alternates regardless of the size of the committee.,74,,
519,0.97,3774.103,3780.543,"And option two, requiring that the elimination of alternates is only applicable to committees of five.",74,,
520,0.97,3780.543,3781.41,Council member Mosqueda.,74,,
521,0.97,3781.41,3782.311,Thank you very much.,75,,
522,0.97,3782.311,3790.953,Given that we are amendment one of many amendments I will go ahead and suggest Council member Pederson.,75,,
523,0.97,3790.953,3792.188,I was intending to support this.,75,,
524,0.97,3792.188,3802.598,I understand that you don't want people coming in necessarily and having how much our staff is already stretched thin Onmultiple issues that committee has taken on.,75,,
525,0.97,3802.598,3803.466,I see the value on that.,75,,
526,0.97,3803.466,3817.246,"And to let you know where I'm going to be, I will probably be a no on this amendment because I still want to make sure that there are five people.",75,,
527,0.97,3817.246,3818.681,If that fifth member.,75,,
528,0.97,3818.681,3833.196,I'm going to go ahead and vote no on this amendment and I understand that there's still work to be done.,75,,
529,0.97,3833.196,3837.3,That sounds like that's in part addressed already.,75,,
530,0.97,3837.3,3839.936,Thank you so much I appreciate that.,75,,
531,0.97,3839.936,3841.671,Okay just as a reminder.,76,,
532,0.97,3841.671,3856.419,The only other voting Council members on the line is Council member Strauss and Council member Juarez.,76,,
533,0.97,3856.419,3861.524,Are there any other comments or questions on this one?,76,,
534,0.97,3861.524,3862.792,Council member Strauss please.,76,,
535,0.97,3862.792,3871.1,Just signaling the same thing that Council member Mosqueda said coming into this meeting.,77,,
536,0.97,3871.1,3872.668,I will not be voting yes today.,77,,
537,0.97,3872.668,3873.002,Okay.,78,,
538,0.97,3873.002,3873.569,I appreciate that.,78,,
539,0.97,3873.569,3884.513,I do think that there's a choice here about potentially having divided votes repeatedly.,78,,
540,0.97,3884.513,3901.931,And or you know managing public expectation and staff time around the deployed as an alternate.,78,,
541,0.97,3901.931,3914.043,And Monday I can have about a potential language or opportunity.,78,,
542,0.97,3914.043,3920.249,And if you would like to advance notice if an alternate is in place.,78,,
543,0.97,3920.249,3928.824,"But I sort of really am hearing that the issue really here is much more about notice, than anything else.",78,,
544,0.97,3928.824,3949.011,"And so, and sensitive to that need and will continue to have conversations with Council member Pedersen and others to see if something related to notice in Nonemergent situations may be the better path here.",78,,
545,0.97,3949.011,3953.716,And what we're waiting for alternates.,78,,
546,0.97,3953.716,3954.116,Okay colleagues.,78,,
547,0.97,3954.116,3959.088,I'm going to ahead and call this to a vote because we've had a conversation for some time.,78,,
548,0.97,3959.088,3968.297,Will the clerk please call the role on the adoption of amendment one.,78,,

558,0.97,3979.742,3980.009,No.,88,,
559,0.97,3980.009,3983.212,It's one approving four opposed.,89,,
560,0.97,3983.212,3996.592,The motion fails the amendment is not adopted and the bill is still before the Council.,89,,
561,0.97,3996.592,4002.131,Amendment two is also authored.,90,,
562,0.97,4002.131,4008.738,We will invite you to Scroll to the next page.,90,,
563,0.97,4008.738,4022.151,Amendment two will allow Council members to abstain resolution to the full council except for those resolutions that are coming from the select budget committee.,90,,
564,0.97,4022.151,4029.425,Under the current rules Abstentions are not permitted.,90,,
565,0.97,4029.425,4032.561,This expands where extensions are allowed.,90,,
566,0.97,4032.561,4037.233,I'm going to go ahead and move this amendment.,91,,
567,0.97,4037.233,4043.472,Council member Pedersen is the author of amendment two.,91,,
568,0.97,4043.472,4045.875,And I'm the sponsor of Amendmenttwo.,91,,
569,0.97,4045.875,4049.745,So I'm going to move to amend on amendment two on the agenda.,91,,
570,0.97,4049.745,4050.446,Is there a second.,91,,
571,0.97,4050.446,4051.047,Second.,92,,
572,0.97,4051.047,4054.283,Thank you so much Council member Juarez.,93,,
573,0.97,4054.283,4055.785,We really appreciate it.,93,,
574,0.97,4055.785,4059.188,It's been moved and Seconded to move amendment.,93,,
575,0.97,4059.188,4060.089,Two.,93,,
576,0.97,4060.089,4069.098,I'm going to hand it to Council member Pedersen to address the amendment as the author of said amendment.,93,,
577,0.97,4069.098,4070.466,Thank you Council President.,94,,
578,0.97,4070.466,4074.003,Colleagues I've advocated for this option previously.,94,,
579,0.97,4074.003,4088.584,I think the past two years of reinforced rational to have this as an option to abstain not on Ordnances or budgets but resolutions.,94,,
580,0.97,4088.584,4098.494,This brings Roberts rules of orders where extensions are allowed in all Meetsings.,94,,
581,0.97,4098.494,4100.596,Extensions are allowed Inyakama.,94,,
582,0.97,4100.596,4116.745,While some may argue that we're elected officials and we're here to make decisions and abstaining is not a decision.,94,,
583,0.97,4116.745,4117.813,Resolutions can sometimes stray from obligations.,94,,
584,0.97,4117.813,4129.558,"The time that we and our team our central staff have spent crafting, and debating resolution.",94,,
585,0.97,4129.558,4133.596,It's time spent away from other Ordnances and budget matters.,94,,
586,0.97,4133.596,4144.373,The ability to abstain still able for a resolution to Comeforward.,94,,
587,0.97,4144.373,4147.61,Just gives an option to the independently individuals to abstain.,94,,
588,0.97,4147.61,4157.353,I think that you know for those who don't like the idea of Abstentions they don't have to abstain.,94,,
589,0.97,4157.353,4166.996,That's the responsibility and choice of an independently elected official to abstain.,94,,
590,0.97,4166.996,4170.232,And that should help with productivity if we have this option.,94,,
591,0.97,4170.232,4171.0,Thank you.,94,,
592,0.97,4171.0,4175.738,"Great, thank you so much Council member Pedersen.",95,,
593,0.97,4175.738,4183.546,Are there any comments or questions on amendment two?,95,,
594,0.97,4183.546,4191.153,I'm just going to Scroll through here.,95,,
595,0.97,4191.153,4194.056,I'm not seeing any hands on amendment three.,95,,
596,0.97,4194.056,4245.741,I have generally seen the position that you described in your remarks that I do think that resolution of abstaining and generally to support the position of allowing Council members to abstain during full Council and I appreciate that your amendment has gotten Nuanced since you and I first talked about this potential proposal and that you're now proposing to allow for extensions only in those instances in which there aren't fiscal impacts.,95,,
597,0.97,4245.741,4262.157,I did want to ask Council staff one technical question which is that the amendment refer specifically to resolutions that come to the Council with recommendations from the select budget committee.,95,,
598,0.97,4262.157,4274.403,And there are other amendments in the resolution attachment that make a Finance Committee a standing committee.,95,,
599,0.97,4274.403,4299.695,"And so I'm a little worried that because now it's very, very narrow to the select budget committee that there may be resolutions to come from the Finance related Committee on finance related issues that would not fall under the umbrella of this particular amendment and Council rule if amended.",95,,
600,0.97,4299.695,4319.648,"So can you just walk us through other aspects of the Council rule related to the sort of how Finance Committee issues are dealt with in terms of the structure, of the city council.",95,,
601,0.97,4319.648,4322.718,"Sure, I'm happy to start and pass it to you again.",96,,
602,0.97,4322.718,4333.295,We certainly had discussion about how to capture the idea of Nonbudget resolutions into technical language.,96,,
603,0.97,4333.295,4339.635,And recognize budget work happens in both.,96,,
604,0.97,4339.635,4350.279,The resolution come out of budget committee when you're studying the budget for the next year.,96,,
605,0.97,4350.279,4357.052,If there was a sense that we were going to Miss the significant body of resolutions there.,96,,
606,0.97,4357.052,4368.063,Do you want to weigh in with any more detail on your thinking.,96,,
607,0.97,4368.063,4375.27,I think on the Finance Committee I acknowledge our Finance Committee are often times coupled with other issues.,97,,
608,0.97,4375.27,4391.053,Whether it's housing or labor standard issues or other kinds of issues so I don't intend to make all of those things part of this discussion.,97,,
609,0.97,4391.053,4409.505,But I would hate for there to be the unintended consequence of the resolution for example Su Supplimentary budgets.,97,,
610,0.97,4409.505,4415.744,To abstain would be inappropriate.,97,,
611,0.97,4415.744,4426.321,"So I'm interested in, I have softened my position.",97,,
612,0.97,4426.321,4427.322,Congratulations Council member Pederson.,97,,
613,0.97,4427.322,4428.791,I have softened my position.,97,,
614,0.97,4428.791,4452.548,I would like to capture those resolutions that may come from budget Ordnances through a Nonselect budget committee process and so would like to sort of think through how to better capture that intent.,97,,
615,0.97,4452.548,4456.985,So that it's not entirely related to budget legislation.,97,,
616,0.97,4456.985,4457.519,Through budget process.,97,,
617,0.97,4457.519,4472.034,"And I think, I think it would probably take a little bit more work on our behalf this week to be Workshopping with you all to define the budget process.",98,,
618,0.97,4472.034,4485.18,To support this and then we can try to bring a technical amendment that further NARROWS or you can hold this and we can bring a version of it that makes some of those changes for Monday.,98,,
619,0.97,4485.18,4485.447,Great.,99,,
620,0.97,4485.447,4486.114,Great.,99,,
621,0.97,4486.114,4487.349,Council member Strauss.,99,,
622,0.97,4487.349,4488.884,"Your hand is raised, please.",99,,
623,0.97,4488.884,4496.391,"Well, thank you Council president and thank you Council member Pedersen.",100,,
624,0.97,4496.391,4498.026,I want to support.,100,,
625,0.97,4498.026,4507.202,I do understand there's a fair amount of city business that is RES lute through Council business that.,100,,
626,0.97,4507.202,4519.915,The exception so it would be however Council members would not be allow to abstain from Council votes on resolutions that refer to city business.,100,,
627,0.97,4519.915,4527.222,"So if, a resolution is before us that is regarding something that is not germane to our daily duties in business.",101,,
628,0.97,4527.222,4538.867,Then the extension is allowed however if the resolution is regarding city business an extension would not be allowed.,101,,
629,0.97,4538.867,4539.868,Thanks Council member Strauss.,102,,
630,0.97,4539.868,4542.704,I think that's getting to the heart of what I was trying to articulate.,102,,
631,0.97,4542.704,4554.816,I just wanted to keep it to the finest aspects as that's what's Council member Pedersen was suggesting in his amendment.,102,,
632,0.97,4554.816,4560.088,I am going to call on Council member Pedersen.,102,,
633,0.97,4560.088,4570.799,I'm giving you a chance to listen to Council member reaction and I will invite Youinto the dialogue with more thinking here.,102,,
634,0.97,4570.799,4571.433,Council member Herbold please.,102,,
635,0.97,4571.433,4586.214,I just want to say that I would like to take this opportunity to echo the feed back that we just heard from Council member Strauss.,103,,
636,0.97,4586.214,4599.428,A resolution that pertain to city business that are you know focused on the Council's position on items that are assigned to our committee.,103,,
637,0.97,4599.428,4608.67,I think they are still very important to know where individual Council members stand on those.,103,,
638,0.97,4608.67,4630.826,I think I understand what Council Pedersen is trying to create some discretion on the ability to not vote on resolutions that are unrelated to city business and I support that.,103,,
639,0.97,4630.826,4639.968,But don't want to cast the net too wide with that discretion.,103,,
640,0.97,4639.968,4640.268,Thank you.,103,,
641,0.97,4640.268,4640.769,Great.,104,,
642,0.97,4640.769,4642.537,Go ahead.,104,,
643,0.97,4642.537,4653.749,"Thank you, I was going to gang up on Council member Herbold's point.",105,,
644,0.97,4653.749,4660.822,"When we're Workshopping, if this gets put in a request for staff to work with interested parties on a proposal.",105,,
645,0.97,4660.822,4687.315,I think it would be a good idea to make it be some Decider about which resolutions fall into the camp of being acceptable for extensions . meet some other budget exceptions at time of referral or at a later date.,105,,
646,0.97,4687.315,4697.059,I think there would need to be some Decider whether a resolution meets the criteria or doesn't in order to set the stage for vote at full council.,105,,
647,0.97,4697.059,4700.295,"Dan, you're reading my mind.",106,,
648,0.97,4700.295,4706.835,We have worked together for too long or just enough apparently.,106,,
649,0.97,4706.835,4710.005,I was thinking the same thing.,106,,
650,0.97,4710.005,4719.848,The phrase city business is in the eye of the Beholder in terms of how to define it.,106,,
651,0.97,4719.848,4734.396,So I do think somebody needs to make a call about whether or not someone will make the call.,106,,
652,0.97,4734.396,4752.614,"It would trigger this provision of the Council rule to allow individual Council members to exercise your discretion of either voting for, against or abstaining on that resolution.",106,,
653,0.97,4752.614,4767.762,"So I am going to suggest that, well first of all before I Makea suggestion.",106,,
654,0.97,4767.762,4771.099,I will fulfill my commitment and call on Council member Pedersen.,106,,
655,0.97,4771.099,4772.267,Thank you Council President.,107,,
656,0.97,4772.267,4780.375,The intent of city business or not that was actually you know thought of and we branded the same problem.,107,,
657,0.97,4780.375,4782.043,How did we decide it.,107,,
658,0.97,4782.043,4788.65,That puts a big burden on the council member.,107,,
659,0.97,4788.65,4790.318,And There'Sthe argument about what's city business.,107,,
660,0.97,4790.318,4792.687,That's how we narrow it down to the budget.,107,,
661,0.97,4792.687,4796.725,I would be very open to the budget committee and Finance Committee.,107,,
662,0.97,4796.725,4799.227,And we could try it out.,107,,
663,0.97,4799.227,4802.964,And see how it goes.,107,,
664,0.97,4802.964,4809.604,Because you know these rules are an art and we put them in practice and see how it goes.,107,,
665,0.97,4809.604,4816.811,The extension is really on the Council members abstaining.,107,,
666,0.97,4816.811,4818.914,If someone is upset.,107,,
667,0.97,4818.914,4824.452,Hey they should make a decision.,107,,
668,0.97,4824.452,4829.291,It's Council members order.,107,,
669,0.97,4829.291,4833.595,International law that has some city business.,107,,
670,0.97,4833.595,4836.131,That's what I'm concerned about.,107,,
671,0.97,4836.131,4842.971,I'm trying to solve for to not burden nine Council staff and% Council staff.,107,,
672,0.97,4842.971,4856.585,May be in the form of a resolution that's not budgetary.,107,,
673,0.97,4856.585,4866.528,Would be very open to adding t Council and see how it goes.,107,,
674,0.97,4866.528,4874.002,I think Workshopping or creating a Decider can potentially be complicated.,108,,
675,0.97,4874.002,4880.542,"So I am going to suggest, I'm sorry, council member Strauss go ahead before I suggest a potential path forward.",108,,
676,0.97,4880.542,4880.876,Go ahead.,108,,
677,0.97,4880.876,4903.064,Thank you for letting me just keep piping in we my thoughts as we're in an E lit an lit Erative moment.,109,,
678,0.97,4903.064,4910.105,I would suggest the city clerk be the Decider.,109,,
679,0.97,4910.105,4916.111,City clerk.,110,,
680,0.97,4916.111,4918.847,Or are you saying the city President.,110,,
681,0.97,4918.847,4920.181,I am happy with both.,111,,
682,0.97,4920.181,4925.954,We usually don't put the city clerk.,112,,
683,0.97,4925.954,4933.328,If you want a Decider I would look at a frame work that allow the Council President to make the decision.,112,,
684,0.97,4933.328,4938.066,The reality is the Council President makes decisions every week on what gets referred.,112,,
685,0.97,4938.066,4941.97,What doesn't get referred and where it gets referred.,112,,
686,0.97,4941.97,4946.107,"So this again, doesn't prevent a resolution from moving forward.",112,,
687,0.97,4946.107,4957.786,It simply opens up the door to whether or not a council member will be able to abstain.,112,,
688,0.97,4957.786,4970.799,And so that's what the effect is adopting to is just allowing for that opportunity to be exercised.,112,,
689,0.97,4970.799,4973.335,For the sake of keeping the ball moving here.,112,,
690,0.97,4973.335,4979.307,I would suggest that we take a vote on amendment two.,112,,
691,0.97,4979.307,4996.057,"And that we in the next day or two work to create the amendment language that will be acceptable and you know I think, I am inclined.",112,,
692,0.97,4996.057,5009.137,I would like to see language that would either allow for an opportunity to sort of look at sort of city council business s determined by the Council President.,112,,
693,0.97,5009.137,5025.52,Which and I think it's also important for us to have language that makes sense about your budget related legislation that comes from the Finance or select budget committees.,112,,
694,0.97,5025.52,5040.135,In either instances I will flag that I think the Council President is going to be put in the situation of making the call.,112,,
695,0.97,5040.135,5041.069,As to whether something is budget related.,112,,
696,0.97,5041.069,5047.375,If staff can put a little more thinking into those potential opportunities.,112,,
697,0.97,5047.375,5065.36,I would really greatly appreciate that and I think that for today's purposes I would like us to advance this amendment out of committee with the understanding that there will likely be some additional modifications.,112,,
698,0.97,5065.36,5072.233,Does that sound acceptable to members of the committee ..,112,,
699,0.97,5072.233,5072.801,Council member Mosqueda.,112,,
700,0.97,5072.801,5077.272,Were you encouraging Council members to take a Yes vote on this item?,113,,
701,0.97,5077.272,5086.648,I'm encouraging folks to take a Yes vote on this item for purposes of advancing it out of committee.,114,,
702,0.97,5086.648,5099.427,And making sure that we have the base by either having one of the two options that I just referred to.,114,,
703,0.97,5099.427,5111.906,"Could the clerk please Scroll up, we're talking about amendment number two correct.",115,,
704,0.97,5111.906,5116.911,Correct.,116,,
705,0.97,5116.911,5118.246,Okay.,117,,
706,0.97,5118.246,5121.416,"Ma'am President, I'm happy to move this amendment.",117,,
707,0.97,5121.416,5132.56,I think it's our job that we have all Council members voting on pieces of legislation regardless of committee and the impact.,117,,
708,0.97,5132.56,5151.579,"I will vote yes, I was prepared to vote no everyone as it relates to resolution I would like to see Council members taking a final vote on the final Council committee meeting but I will vote yes on the request today and look forward to follow up with you.",117,,
709,0.97,5151.579,5154.649,"Thank you, council member Mosqueda.",118,,
710,0.97,5154.649,5159.954,And for the viewing public and any other public Council members who might disagree with putting this in the base.,118,,
711,0.97,5159.954,5165.46,There's always an opportunity to have an amendment to pull it out on Monday.,118,,
712,0.97,5165.46,5182.51,If that is something that anyone intends to do I would ask that you contact our office right away so that we can work with Council central staff and the city clerk's office on managing those logistics.,118,,
713,0.97,5182.51,5185.18,Okay any other comments or questions?,118,,
714,0.97,5185.18,5187.315,"Will the clerk please, sorry go ahead.",118,,
715,0.97,5187.315,5187.682,Council member.,118,,
716,0.97,5187.682,5196.124,"Just so that I understand, so we're not amending this at all just go for two resolutions for example.",119,,
717,0.97,5196.124,5206.367,"This would be on items that have come to us that don't have an implication from the budget, okay go ahead if you can repeat for me.",119,,
718,0.97,5206.367,5213.441,Amendment two in its base form is what we're voting on.,120,,
719,0.97,5213.441,5217.412,Amendment two is strictly limited to resolutions only.,120,,
720,0.97,5217.412,5218.112,I apologize.,121,,
721,0.97,5218.112,5223.184,I misunderstood.,121,,
722,0.97,5223.184,5228.556,I still have concerns about just resolutions.,121,,
723,0.97,5228.556,5235.463,Okay will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of amendment two.,122,,
724,0.97,5235.463,5236.965,Council member Juarez.,123,,
725,0.97,5236.965,5237.332,Aye.,124,,
726,0.97,5237.332,5240.034,Council member Lewis.,125,,

734,0.97,5247.242,5248.643,"That's five in favor, none opposed.",133,,
735,0.97,5248.643,5251.079,"Great, thank you so much.",134,,
736,0.97,5251.079,5259.12,The motion carries and the amendment is adopted.,134,,

740,0.97,5268.63,5269.03,Go ahead.,134,,
741,0.97,5269.03,5270.431,No problem.,135,,
742,0.97,5270.431,5275.97,Amendment three is Coauthored by Council member Pedersen and Council member Herbold.,135,,
743,0.97,5275.97,5289.55,"I am characterizing this as a technical correction and so invite you, it's a little bit complicated but invite you to address it with that amount of time and attention.",135,,
744,0.97,5289.55,5295.857,Each of these Council members identified this issue in the underlying resolution in a different way.,135,,
745,0.97,5295.857,5301.462,So we actually might be helpful if you Scroll up just so we can see the language that is actually changed.,135,,
746,0.97,5301.462,5302.563,Yeah right there.,135,,
747,0.97,5302.563,5309.804,Just down a little bit more so we see three there.,135,,
748,0.97,5309.804,5323.251,So the underlying sorry in our last committee meeting we talked about the temporal nature of introducing legislation.,135,,
749,0.97,5323.251,5329.357,When that legislation is in committee only members of the committee may offer amendments to that legislation.,135,,
750,0.97,5329.357,5337.298,And amendment to the resolution was clarifying that intent.,135,,
751,0.97,5337.298,5342.837,And then at full council any Council member can cosponsor.,135,,
752,0.97,5342.837,5349.143,"There was confusion, what does it mean to Council legislation after introduction.",135,,
753,0.97,5349.143,5354.749,To clarify that confusion we are striking out legislation here in three.,135,,
754,0.97,5354.749,5366.16,The change here indicates that Council members on a committee may sponsor amendments been the committee our Tech here again is a technical clean up of this language.,135,,
755,0.97,5366.16,5368.529,Great thank you so much director handy.,136,,
756,0.97,5368.529,5377.205,I'm going to go ahead on the discussion.,136,,

764,0.97,5431.092,5442.937,"Great, thank you so much Council member Herbold.",140,,
765,0.97,5442.937,5445.273,Anything to add Council member Pederson.,140,,

767,0.97,5455.349,5456.484,But any comments on amendment three.,140,,
768,0.97,5456.484,5462.89,I don't see any hands raised so we're going to go ahead and call the roll.,140,,
769,0.97,5462.89,5470.498,Will the clerk please call the roll on amendment three.,140,,

782,0.97,5504.966,5507.502,The next amendment is number ten.,150,,
783,0.97,5507.502,5522.65,"I will say the next three amendments address the sponsorship of legislation in some way, the number is the number in which we drafted them but we presented them out of order.",150,,
784,0.97,5522.65,5531.559,These next three are in conflict with each other.,150,,
785,0.97,5531.559,5534.762,So amendment ten is authored by Council member Strauss.,150,,
786,0.97,5534.762,5543.938,A piece of legislation that does not have a sponsor maybe introduced as either Executiverequested or Department requested legislation.,150,,
787,0.97,5543.938,5554.782,You may recall from our discussion last week that the underlying resolution made a change to clarify the Council's current practice that a bill may be introduced without a sponsor.,150,,
788,0.97,5554.782,5570.598,This would further amend that change as described so that if it did not have a council member sponsor the Council President could assign executive request or a permit requested to that legislation.,150,,
789,0.97,5570.598,5572.833,"Great, thank you so much director handy.",151,,
790,0.97,5572.833,5577.972,This one is sponsored by Council member Strauss.,151,,
791,0.97,5577.972,5582.243,I'm going to recognize Council member Strauss to make his motion.,151,,
792,0.97,5582.243,5586.38,This is per our conversation last week.,152,,
793,0.97,5586.38,5592.219,I took time to further refine what I meant as city business etc.,152,,
794,0.97,5592.219,5594.188,Etc.,152,,
795,0.97,5594.188,5595.089,You will see.,152,,
796,0.97,5595.089,5595.69,Council member Strauss.,153,,
797,0.97,5595.69,5605.733,I'm to interrupt but you have to make your motion first.,153,,
798,0.97,5605.733,5612.807,"I move amendment ten, as described.",154,,
799,0.97,5612.807,5613.574,Is there a second.,155,,
800,0.97,5613.574,5616.944,Okay thank you so much it has been moved and Seconded.,156,,
801,0.97,5616.944,5623.985,Sorry for being such a stickler on the rules during a rules conversation here.,156,,
802,0.97,5623.985,5628.222,Has been moved and Seconded to adopt amendment ten as presented on the agenda.,156,,
803,0.97,5628.222,5629.457,Council member Strauss.,156,,
804,0.97,5629.457,5631.125,You are recognized in order to address your amendment.,156,,
805,0.97,5631.125,5638.299,"Thank you, and thank you to all the city clerks.",157,,
806,0.97,5638.299,5649.644,If what you will see with this amendment as well as amendment 15.,157,,
807,0.97,5649.644,5660.588,"And the state legislatures that I've worked with, I've worked at the city of Seattle for four years and I've worked at the state Legislature for six years I believe.",157,,
808,0.97,5660.588,5662.49,Not counting doesn't matter.,157,,
809,0.97,5662.49,5671.599,The intent of this amendment is so that we never have legislation that comes out of thin air.,157,,
810,0.97,5671.599,5681.409,That we can track to where it originated on.,157,,
811,0.97,5681.409,5692.787,There's sometimes legislation that is in the need for good Governance.,157,,
812,0.97,5692.787,5707.201,So this legislation would make sure there's still a name associated with the legislation and freeze the Council to oppose or support the legislation based on it merits.,157,,
813,0.97,5707.201,5708.602,This is the practice in Olympia.,157,,
814,0.97,5708.602,5722.049,Oftentimes legislation is submitted that does not have a sponsor or cosponsor rather it is Department requested so following that practice this is my memo.,157,,
815,0.97,5722.049,5730.157,Great thank you so much.,158,,
816,0.97,5730.157,5732.626,"Council Herbold, thank you please.",158,,
817,0.97,5732.626,5742.269,We heard from the League of women voters.,159,,
818,0.97,5742.269,5742.87,Is that additional language.,159,,
819,0.97,5742.87,5745.206,Was necessary.,159,,
820,0.97,5745.206,5768.796,Do you feel that with additional Hrapblg language will help to maybe not ensure but to facilitate a goal of minimizing the number of times that bills are referred without a specific sponsor.,159,,
821,0.97,5768.796,5778.405,Yes I did hear that testimony.,160,,
822,0.97,5778.405,5780.341,And that's a good add.,160,,
823,0.97,5780.341,5782.076,I have it in my notes.,160,,
824,0.97,5782.076,5785.412,This is the exception not the rule.,160,,
825,0.97,5785.412,5792.92,I don't necessarily have language prepared for that but it's welcomed.,160,,
826,0.97,5792.92,5797.291,In sort of response to that particular commentary.,161,,
827,0.97,5797.291,5821.382,I want to make part of the record the reality that it is my understanding is that the current position is the charters and municipal code does allow for bills to be introduced without a sponsor.,161,,
828,0.97,5821.382,5841.068,And that's part of the reasons why we included the language in resolution is to simply Memorialize that existing authority within the Charter and relevant Srepbs.,161,,
829,0.97,5841.068,5841.569,Seattle municipal code.,161,,
830,0.97,5841.569,5846.74,"So,, relevance Seattle municipal code.",161,,
831,0.97,5846.74,5862.189,I don't want to make the impression that we're some how creating a new Rite in terms of the issue of listing legislation with a no sponsor required.,161,,
832,0.97,5862.189,5909.67,"That being said, I do Understandcouncil member Strauss's intent which is to create some additional transparency for members of the viewing public as to the genesis of the legislation if it's not coming from a specific, from a specific Council member Arguably it has been a little odd to have legislation listed on the introduction and referral with no Council required and it does in practice present a situation in which its unclear which Council member is going to speak on a resolution.",161,,
833,0.97,5909.67,5926.32,"I don't think that the last point having it listed is, executive or Department requested.",161,,
834,0.97,5926.32,5951.178,But do want to acknowledge that I appreciate where the bill is coming from if it isn't coming from from . questions on this one.,161,,
835,0.97,5951.178,5961.322,I'm not hearing any other comments or hearing any Otheritems raised so will the clerk please call the rule.,161,,

868,0.97,6083.243,6091.018,I remember a constituent response to constituents who were unhappy that the Council had not introduced a piece of legislation.,178,,
869,0.97,6091.018,6113.64,And they are looking for the reference that no it's actually part of the job of the council member to confer with the committee chair before deciding to circumvent a committee.,178,,
870,0.97,6113.64,6129.556,I am happy to Memorialize that to make sure the public understands the decision make of the Council.,178,,
871,0.97,6129.556,6146.54,This would set an accomplish an annual work agenda by clarifying that the expectation is that the Council President refer to the chair and legislation before putting it on the arc.,178,,
872,0.97,6146.54,6147.174,The Council President.,178,,
873,0.97,6147.174,6163.624,This does not limit the ability to make an independent decision about the arc and the Cosponsoring Council member can still request it to send it to the arc.,178,,
874,0.97,6163.624,6173.767,And this,178,,

880,0.97,6220.48,6233.493,So this is I think focus on a particular subject as it relates to the decision to refer legislation.,181,,

891,0.97,6341.868,6362.155,There would need to be an amendment that allows for a chair to impose a deadline and for there not to be an opportunity for a council member to circumvent that deadline.,187,,

1027,0.97,7058.151,7064.991,"If you pick adventure one, that is your adventure assuming it passes.",246,,
1028,0.97,7064.991,7096.222,"So, just want to make sure that folks understand that we will be discussing all three amendments at the same time, but take votes individually, but we will be putting all three options on the table so that we can have a collective conversation about potential options for us and that folks can have a well-informed decision when they are asked to vote.",246,,
1029,0.97,7096.222,7103.362,"Okay.Councilmember Strauss, I'm going to call on you to move your proposed amendment, which is six a.",246,,
1030,0.97,7107.867,7108.534,Council President Ellipse,247,,
1031,0.97,7108.534,7112.738,"I'm sorry, we are going to have a discussion sorry.",248,,
1032,0.97,7112.738,7113.94,"Director handy, sorry about that.",248,,
1033,0.97,7113.94,7119.245,My recommendation is that we explained the three amendments and I'm going to pass it to Dan to TVs up.,249,,
1034,0.97,7120.78,7121.848,I appreciate that again.,250,,
1035,0.97,7121.848,7133.459,I have been--I feel like just living with these amendments and moving faster than what I should be.,250,,
1036,0.97,7133.459,7134.694,Thank you for the reminder.,250,,
1037,0.97,7134.961,7135.862,Thank you very much.,251,,
1038,0.97,7135.862,7155.181,"It might be helpful to put up the overview that shows the status quo and the three amendments related to meeting schedules as the Council President mentioned, there are three options that have been posted to the agenda.",251,,
1039,0.97,7155.181,7157.183,"Amendments 6a, 6B, and 6C.",251,,
1040,0.97,7157.183,7176.202,My understanding is that one of these amendments is not going to proceed and I have asked for confirmation for the sponsor of 6C please.,251,,
1041,0.97,7176.202,7183.91,"Councilmember Mosqueda, you are the sponsor of the proposed amendment 6C, so I'm going to recommend that you insert the question.",252,,
1042,0.97,7183.91,7187.68,"Thank you, Council President.",253,,
1043,0.97,7187.68,7188.681,Thank you deputy director.,253,,
1044,0.97,7188.681,7189.582,You are correct.,253,,
1045,0.97,7189.582,7194.62,"Colleagues, I am going to be limiting your Adventurechoices to two.",253,,
1046,0.97,7194.62,7209.435,"We will go ahead and remove 6C from the docket here today, Justãjust a quick follow-up on this in the last meeting I had indicated interest in a Wednesday meeting.",253,,
1047,0.97,7209.435,7232.959,"Given the discussions I was interested in a Wednesday morning meeting, but also in conversations with the clerk to understand some of the limitations in terms of how the committee meetings may sort of create compounding requirements on staff time, not just in the clerk's office but I can imagine in our offices as well to reduce that complication.",253,,
1048,0.97,7232.959,7240.266,I will go ahead and remove 6C and look forward to talking more about the other two options.,253,,
1049,0.97,7240.266,7241.267,"Thank you, Council President.",253,,
1050,0.97,7241.267,7241.734,Great.,254,,
1051,0.97,7241.734,7244.57,"I appreciate that Councilmember Mosqueda, I really do.",254,,
1052,0.97,7244.57,7255.348,"So, we will focus the presentation from central stuff in the discussion to proposed amendments six a and 6B.",254,,
1053,0.97,7255.348,7256.749,"Again, you have to adventure choices.",254,,
1054,0.97,7256.749,7258.618,You can choose one but not both.,254,,
1055,0.97,7263.789,7264.89,"Thank you, Council President.",255,,
1056,0.97,7264.89,7267.493,"So, this matrix has a lot of information on it.",255,,
1057,0.97,7267.493,7298.591,"I thought to capture all of the moving parts that show what is in the, what is labeled as in the first column as the status quo situation, and that is just what is in the resolution that is put for you before any amendments come up and then the next two columns labeled at the top six a and 6B show you how the amendment would change the status quo.",255,,
1058,0.97,7298.591,7306.332,So I think it might be helpful for me to stay at the high level and then address any questions at the highest level.,255,,
1059,0.97,7306.332,7324.817,The current situation reflected in the resolution before you would have the Council briefings happen at 9:30 in the morning on Mondays and the Council meetings happen on--at 2 PM on Mondays.,255,,
1060,0.97,7324.817,7331.457,And that is the way things stand today.,255,,
1061,0.97,7331.457,7337.763,The amendment 68 would change the briefings meeting scheduled from 9:30 A.M.,255,,
1062,0.97,7337.763,7345.137,On Monday to 2 PM on Monday and that is the same for 6B.,255,,
1063,0.97,7345.137,7354.246,There is no conflict between the two amendments with respect to win the briefings happen on a regular basis.,255,,
1064,0.97,7354.246,7364.79,The major change from the status quo between six a and 6B is with respect to regular Council meetings.,255,,
1065,0.97,7364.79,7374.567,They would move in six a from 2 PM on Monday until Tuesday at 9:30 in the morning.,255,,
1066,0.97,7374.567,7379.405,"In 6B, council meetings would move from Monday's at 2 PM to Tuesdays at 2 PM.",255,,
1067,0.97,7379.405,7391.417,"So, in both cases it would be moving from a Monday to a Tuesday with the difference here that the regular meetings in six they would be at 9:30 in the evening as opposed to 2 PM.",255,,
1068,0.97,7391.417,7423.716,"The implications for those as described in the next three rows, the most significant one is when Monday's fall on a legal holiday, there is a rolling effect that is addressed differently in six a than the 6B.",255,,
1069,0.97,7423.716,7426.752,I will open to questions.,255,,
1070,0.97,7426.752,7434.86,When Monday falls on a holiday the Monday briefings would move to a Tuesday in 6a.,255,,
1071,0.97,7434.86,7450.943,"They would move to--they would necessarily have to move Mondays are proposed to be--I'm sorry, Tuesdays in the morning are proposed to be Council meetings.",255,,
1072,0.97,7450.943,7455.781,"So, that means that the Council meeting would also have to change if it is going to happen after the Council briefing.",255,,
1073,0.97,7455.781,7468.794,"So, there is a change from briefings go from Monday to Tuesday on a legal holiday that falls on a Monday, council moves from Tuesday to Wednesday.",255,,
1074,0.97,7468.794,7475.334,And then the committee meetings that would normally happen on those days both get bumped to Friday in the morning and the afternoon.,255,,
1075,0.97,7478.103,7488.914,"In 6B, there is a different approach for what happens with Monday Holidays.Council briefings would be canceled.",255,,
1076,0.97,7488.914,7509.835,There are five or six of them I think that happened throughout the year where Monday is a legal holiday outside of normal Council recess at the end of August and December . Those five or six regularly scheduled Council briefings under 6B would simply be canceled.,255,,
1077,0.97,7509.835,7513.305,That means that there were not need to be a change to the Tuesday council meeting.,255,,
1078,0.97,7513.305,7520.412,It could continue as regularly planned.,255,,
1079,0.97,7520.412,7526.318,"The only other thing that I will highlight for you, although there are indications for what happens when--Tuesday.",255,,
1080,0.97,7526.318,7534.46,We often talk about the Wednesday--see it has been withdrawn.,255,,
1081,0.97,7534.46,7562.655,"But--also, I am talking about be eight, which calls for the amendments that are going to come to Council to be distributed at least two hours before the Council meeting if in 6a, the consul meeting is at 9:30 in the morning, two hours before the start of the Council meeting at 7:30 in the morning.",255,,
1082,0.97,7562.655,7575.634,"So, six a understands that would be a very early meeting and pushes the deadline to 5 PM on the preceding business day for any amendments coming to full council meetings.",255,,
1083,0.97,7577.236,7579.705,That is a lot of information that I pushed at you.,256,,
1084,0.97,7579.705,7588.247,I would be happy to answer questions that you may have.,256,,
1085,0.97,7588.547,7589.882,"Great, thank you so much, Dan.",257,,
1086,0.97,7589.882,7590.883,I really appreciate it.,257,,
1087,0.97,7590.883,7593.319,"So, now is the time for us to have a conversation.",257,,
1088,0.97,7593.319,7599.224,I do want to get these amendments before us.,257,,
1089,0.97,7599.224,7604.93,I assume that is why you are raising your hand so I will note that you have a question about the actual proposals?,257,,
1090,0.97,7606.265,7614.84,Why don't you go ahead and ask your question.,257,,
1091,0.97,7614.84,7617.509,"Thank you, Council President Úspread it is more of a statement.",258,,
1092,0.97,7617.509,7630.022,Unless there is another Councilmember that is very interested in six a I will go ahead and withdraw that after hearing more from--just now.,258,,
1093,0.97,7630.022,7643.669,I do have questions about the implication of withdrawing a and only being left with 6B.,259,,
1094,0.97,7643.669,7652.444,"As I understand, the description of 6B, it would necessitate in every instance where there is a Monday holiday in briefings being canceled.",259,,
1095,0.97,7652.444,7664.189,As opposed to having the option of scheduling it at another day.,259,,
1096,0.97,7664.189,7666.258,"Vice President, would you like me to address that?",260,,
1097,0.97,7666.258,7671.663,"Yes, please.",261,,
1098,0.97,7671.663,7687.179,"Councilmember Lisa Herbold, you are correct that regularly scheduled meetings would be canceled due to the Council president and Councilmembers generally wishing to hold the Council briefing during such a week when there is a Monday holiday.",262,,
1099,0.97,7687.179,7698.323,I would defer to Elizabeth Atkinson and Monica Martinez to talk about the process for scheduling a special meeting of the Council briefing.,262,,
1100,0.97,7698.323,7706.832,That is certainly a distinct possibility that would still live within the Council rules.,262,,
1101,0.97,7706.832,7715.207,It just would not have a regular meeting of the Council briefings automatically moved to another day.,262,,
1102,0.97,7715.207,7750.175,"Yeah, I would say that the change here is to create a expectation that the Council briefings would be canceled unless otherwise determined, predetermined by the Council president in coordination with the city clerk's office to schedule that in order to meet the public notice requirements, I think that you would probably get pretty early notification about whether you could expect they Council briefing on those weeks in which they are scheduled to be canceled because of the holiday.",263,,
1103,0.97,7750.175,7757.082,"But, we will call on Elizabeth or Monica to provide more detail on that.",263,,
1104,0.97,7760.619,7765.19,Do you want me to address that with the--clerks?,264,,
1105,0.97,7765.19,7765.791,Sure.,265,,
1106,0.97,7765.791,7803.328,"I would advise exactly what was contemplated is that the Council rules said the regular schedule, so this would set a regular schedule or those Monday Council briefings that fall on a Monday holiday it would be canceled, and that would be the regular schedule, and then it would be up to the Council President to schedule a special council briefing as needed in accordance with all of the noticing requirements of the PMA when it is desired for the post Pacific weeks.",265,,
1107,0.97,7803.328,7806.231,"So, I think that is exactly in alignment with the other information provided.",265,,
1108,0.97,7806.231,7812.504,"So again, we are setting regular schedule, but it never Precludes a special meeting from being noticed.",265,,
1109,0.97,7812.504,7832.157,"I would say though then, the difference is when you notice a special meeting, the agenda is set and the agenda cannot be modified at the time of the special meeting, so that would be one difference there when you have a special meeting of the Council for a Council briefing, is that nothing could be added to the agenda at the time of the meeting such as an additional executive session, etc.",265,,
1110,0.97,7832.157,7833.225,Go ahead please.,266,,
1111,0.97,7833.225,7851.677,"The rules--scheduling a special council briefing meeting you mark I am wondering where this under the skin, is there time left on a four day calendar to do that?",267,,
1112,0.97,7851.677,7858.984,"The 6a, under that scheme, there is an available time slot.",267,,
1113,0.97,7858.984,7866.491,"I'm not sure because I have not done this, this helpful exercise that I know you all have done.",267,,
1114,0.97,7866.491,7877.135,Is there a Timeslot that is available under 6B should it be necessary to schedule a Council briefing as a special meeting?,267,,
1115,0.97,7883.709,7887.412,If it is all right I will go ahead and try to speak to that as well.,268,,
1116,0.97,7887.412,7902.494,"So, that would also then kind of determine or be determined by the committee meeting scheduled for that particular week as you are aware, that our next biennial schedule for committees will be set in January 2022 and then we will know for sure when our standing committee meetings have been set.",268,,
1117,0.97,7902.494,7907.132,I would say at this time we do not know for sure.,268,,
1118,0.97,7907.132,7910.836,"We do know when the Monday holidays Whitaker for the next two years, those are well set.",268,,
1119,0.97,7910.836,7920.946,"So, we know that there will be seven in the next two years because of all the Federal holidays that we do observe.",268,,
1120,0.97,7920.946,7941.066,"Therefore, that would be seven Council briefings equity the Council, such as after the Martin Luther King holiday in January, or the Presidents' day holiday in February, and then you would potentially be looking at those weeks, dependent on a committee schedule of when you could fit it in.",268,,
1121,0.97,7941.066,7943.535,Two whatever has been determined at the beginning of the year.,268,,
1122,0.97,7943.535,7948.407,"So, not a straight answer, but at least more information on how you would be able to try to fit that in.",268,,
1123,0.97,7948.707,7952.244,If it is okay I would like to Chime in as well.,269,,
1124,0.97,7952.244,7966.158,"The current practice, aside from the rules that have been introduced at this point, the current practice of a holiday that has been moved to Tuesday.",269,,
1125,0.97,7966.158,7973.598,That any committee meetings that were regularly scheduled on Tuesday have been moved to Friday.,269,,
1126,0.97,7973.598,7990.048,"So I do think that is another Avenue that if Council numbers are partial to, we could Ãi don't want to work it up on any specific which on the fly, but I could work with Councilmembers behind the scenes for a further amendment.",269,,
1127,0.97,7990.349,7996.154,"Thanks, Dan for that.",270,,
1128,0.97,7997.389,8004.629,I am not sure that we need a further amendment here to clarify that would happen.,270,,
1129,0.97,8004.629,8026.818,"I will say that I think that if there is the need to have a Council briefing because it was canceled due to a Monday holiday, we effectively will just do what we do now, which is work with the chair of the committee who has a meeting on Tuesday at 9:30 A.M.",270,,
1130,0.97,8026.818,8043.468,"To schedule them for Friday, Fridays generally are kept pretty clear in terms of the city clerk's calendar to allow for those things to be accommodated and for special needs to be accommodated as well.",270,,
1131,0.97,8043.468,8068.86,"I think to answer your question, I think that there is, there would be an opportunity to do that . It is just a matter of putting it into a fact on those weeks in which we know there is a Monday holiday that necessitates the counseling of the Council briefing that will put into play the need to coordinate with Whomever the committee chair is on Tuesday morning at 9:30 A.M.",270,,
1132,0.97,8068.86,8070.695,To schedule their meetings for the following Friday.,270,,
1133,0.97,8070.695,8083.875,I think that will all be determined in sort of granular detail once the next Council president and the Council adopt a resolution both the schedule and the membership including the chairs.,270,,
1134,0.97,8083.875,8095.42,I do think that there is at least one day to give you some flexibility to be able to have those Council briefings if needed.,270,,
1135,0.97,8095.42,8095.821,All right.,270,,
1136,0.97,8095.821,8100.759,Any other comments or questions on six a or 6B?,270,,
1137,0.97,8105.13,8111.503,"Okay.Council member Strauss, just confirming that you are still withdrawing amendment 6a?",270,,
1138,0.97,8111.503,8112.104,Yes.,271,,
1139,0.97,8112.104,8117.976,I will defer to the wisdom of Councilmember Juarez.,271,,
1140,0.97,8117.976,8126.751,We will only have one amendment to move here and I'm going to get back to the right place in my script here.,272,,
1141,0.97,8126.751,8130.555,There it is.,272,,
1142,0.97,8130.555,8131.022,Okay.,272,,
1143,0.97,8131.022,8145.237,I am going to move to amend resolution 3029 as presented on amendment 6B on the agenda.,272,,
1144,0.97,8145.237,8146.037,Is there a second?,272,,
1145,0.97,8146.037,8146.638,Second.,273,,
1146,0.97,8146.638,8149.474,It has been Seconded to adopt 6B as presented on the agenda.,274,,
1147,0.97,8149.474,8154.346,This amendment is being cosponsored by myself and Councilmember Juarez.,274,,
1148,0.97,8154.346,8160.285,There is no perfect scheduling option here when we are running really busy committee schedules.,274,,
1149,0.97,8160.285,8178.703,Each comes with its own set of challenges but I think that 6B does present the most viable option that will allow for the Fewest number of potential drawbacks in terms of scheduling and logistics.,274,,
1150,0.97,8178.703,8193.585,I do think that maintaining Council meetings at 2:00 would represent the least disruptive changes in the publishing of Agendas materials and having city council meetings at 9:30 A.M.,274,,
1151,0.97,8193.585,8212.637,"The day before actually, you know, I think would allow for us to have a little bit more time to work on things and not be as compressed by the time city council rules around 2:00.",274,,
1152,0.97,8212.637,8222.147,I am happy that this amendment is looking like it is viable and my only regret is that I will not be able to benefit from it.,274,,
1153,0.97,8222.147,8229.12,"So, Councilmember Juarez, I will hand it over to you for any additional comments.",274,,
1154,0.97,8229.12,8231.556,"I was not going to, but I will be brief.",275,,
1155,0.97,8231.556,8232.557,"Thank you, Madam President.",275,,
1156,0.97,8232.557,8235.227,"And again, the reason why I think this is the best alternative.",275,,
1157,0.97,8235.227,8239.064,I want to think again the clerk staff for meeting with us.,275,,
1158,0.97,8239.064,8241.866,Getting back to not making staff work on Sundays.,275,,
1159,0.97,8241.866,8259.784,"Particularly during budget, but also be mindful that we do need to have the legislative and the executive sessions and that there is significant safeguards with discretion of the Council President to move things around.",276,,
1160,0.97,8259.784,8261.119,And having that time to prepare.,276,,
1161,0.97,8261.119,8261.82,So thank you.,276,,
1162,0.97,8262.12,8263.355,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Juarez.",277,,
1163,0.97,8263.355,8263.655,Okay.,277,,
1164,0.97,8263.655,8271.73,Are there any additional comments on amendment 6B?,277,,
1165,0.97,8271.73,8276.401,Councilmember Mosqueda please.,277,,
1166,0.97,8276.401,8280.505,I want to thank central staff and following up on the comments from the Council President.,278,,
1167,0.97,8280.505,8296.121,The central staff have been willing to make themselves available and at the ready to craft amendments over the weekends and on nights and in direct opposition to the public comment that we heard this morning.,278,,
1168,0.97,8296.121,8297.722,No worker should have to do that.,278,,
1169,0.97,8297.722,8301.826,Every worker deserves rest and time to be with her family and community.,278,,
1170,0.97,8301.826,8313.638,And that is especially true from a body that constantly tries to lift up the work of the workers in every industry and I'm glad that we are able to move forward today.,278,,
1171,0.97,8313.638,8320.712,In light of the accusations and Mischaracterizations that I have heard in my committee yesterday as it related to central staff as well.,278,,
1172,0.97,8320.712,8340.632,"I wanted to make sure to take this opportunity to thank central staff for all the work that they do over the weekend and recognize that this amendment expands beyond our policy work and it really I think is going to be a level of good workplace balance, Worklife balance for everyone involved.",278,,
1173,0.97,8340.632,8344.069,"Circle thank you to central staff, to the clerks were on the line here too and I.T.",278,,
1174,0.97,8344.069,8362.387,"And the communications team, and to set the Seattle Channel, we all work to make sure that we are delivering our deliberations publicly on Monday and very happy that this will not be the norm going forward, and very much look forward myself to more Worklife balance for everyone with this amendment.",278,,
1175,0.97,8364.923,8365.79,Councilmember Juarez please.,279,,
1176,0.97,8365.79,8379.003,"You forgot to thank our legislative staff, our staff in our office who find themselves working Sundays and Saturdays and on call and trying to Redraft amendments.",280,,
1177,0.97,8379.003,8380.038,"So, thank you.",280,,
1178,0.97,8380.305,8385.944,Thank you for specially mentioning our teams and our offices as well.,281,,
1179,0.97,8387.245,8422.68,"And I want to acknowledge as the Council President, the work that our Council, sorry our city clerk's play especially the deputy city clerks who hold together scripts and are making revisions until the very last minute including over the weekend and so I think this will be a little relief for them as well and really appreciate that needed balance for them as well.",282,,
1180,0.97,8422.981,8424.716,"Just one, one more edition.",283,,
1181,0.97,8424.716,8453.978,"Really appreciate that working group that gave us the opportunity to provide input to this rule early on and because I am sure that others would have mentioned it, even if we all, as all nine of us did not do so, my input was please, in solving this problem before full Council on Mondays, let's not Replicated for our committees on Monday.",283,,
1182,0.97,8453.978,8462.287,"And in particular, that would be a bigger burden I think on our individual office staff.",283,,
1183,0.97,8462.287,8469.994,"So, in trying to shift the burden for the clerks office we did not want to inadvertently create more of a burden for the legislative aide.",283,,
1184,0.97,8469.994,8480.405,"So, just want to thank the work group that, in developing a proposal, that they considered that input as well.",283,,
1185,0.97,8485.61,8490.315,Agreed that is very important.,284,,
1186,0.97,8490.315,8499.39,Sometimes in solving one issue you inadvertently create another one and that is certainly not what we wanted to do here.,284,,
1187,0.97,8499.39,8500.492,"So, appreciate that.",284,,
1188,0.97,8500.492,8501.092,"Okay, colleagues.",284,,
1189,0.97,8501.092,8503.728,This brings us to the conclusion of the discussion of amendment 6B.,284,,
1190,0.97,8503.728,8507.198,"So, in order to keep moving us along I know that we are running rather long.",284,,
1191,0.97,8507.198,8510.235,I appreciate your patience and your commitment to staying on the line with us.,284,,
1192,0.97,8510.235,8513.071,Will the clerk please call the role on the adoption of amendment 6B?,284,,
1193,0.97,8513.371,8514.138,Mosqueda?,285,,
1194,0.97,8514.138,8514.505,Aye.,286,,
1195,0.97,8514.505,8514.973,Mosqueda?,287,,
1196,0.97,8514.973,8516.941,Aye.,288,,
1197,0.97,8516.941,8518.543,Strauss?,289,,
1198,0.97,8518.543,8523.948,Yes.,290,,
1199,0.97,8523.948,8526.05,Chair Gonzales?,291,,
1200,0.97,8526.05,8526.451,Aye.,292,,
1201,0.97,8526.451,8528.386,"Thank you so much, the amendment is adopted.",293,,
1202,0.97,8528.386,8530.555,"And, we will now move to amendment five.",293,,
1203,0.97,8530.555,8536.261,I will hand it over to the director to walk us through amendment five.,293,,
1204,0.97,8544.102,8545.203,"Thank you, and congratulations.",294,,
1205,0.97,8545.203,8546.17,You are through 10.,294,,
1206,0.97,8546.17,8547.772,There are only five more to go.,294,,
1207,0.97,8547.772,8549.24,We are so close.,295,,
1208,0.97,8549.24,8550.041,We are almost there.,295,,
1209,0.97,8550.041,8551.676,Just as a point of context.,296,,
1210,0.97,8551.676,8562.153,Amendment five is authored by Councilmember Peterson and addresses who may speak during a committee meeting and at Council briefings during the consideration of a motion that has been made and Seconded.,296,,
1211,0.97,8562.153,8578.87,"Specifically this word, this amendment would more specifically provide the chair the power to determine if legislative staff can address the committee when a motion is being considered.",296,,
1212,0.97,8578.87,8588.413,And it would create a new rule that Presenters who are not legislative staff are not allowed to address the committee and during consideration of a motion.,296,,
1213,0.97,8588.413,8591.916,I will just give that high- level and happy to answer questions in the course of discussion.,296,,
1214,0.97,8592.216,8593.518,"Thank you so much, director handy.",297,,
1215,0.97,8593.518,8603.428,It will move to amend the resolution as presented on amendment five on the agenda.,297,,
1216,0.97,8603.428,8604.095,Is there a second?,297,,
1217,0.97,8604.095,8604.696,Second.,298,,
1218,0.97,8604.696,8609.767,It has been moved and Seconded to adopt amendment five as presented.,299,,
1219,0.97,8609.767,8613.037,I will hand it over to Councilmember Pedersen who is the author of this amendment.,299,,
1220,0.97,8617.175,8618.509,"Thank you, Council President.",300,,
1221,0.97,8618.509,8620.545,I'm excited about what just past as well with 6B.,300,,
1222,0.97,8620.545,8636.194,I know that a lot of us independently thought of this idea and it was great to see this independent consensus about doing something to really know that we can time and have things on Tuesday is a real big help.,300,,
1223,0.97,8636.194,8638.83,"So, regarding this amendment, there might be different ways of doing this.",300,,
1224,0.97,8638.83,8644.268,Sometimes we will have committees will have outside guests or interest groups at the table.,300,,
1225,0.97,8644.268,8655.079,And this will still allow for that input at the chairs discretion to have that input.,300,,
1226,0.97,8655.079,8676.801,"It is really just saying, especially important during the zoo meetings, when it is, everybody is on the screen and it is not clear what the rules are at that time, once a motion is made and Seconded, then it is really among Councilmembers to have their deliberation to turn as elected officials and to have the floor and hash things out as elected.",300,,
1227,0.97,8676.801,8682.273,"So, that, that was what this amendment is intended to do.",300,,
1228,0.97,8682.273,8683.941,"So, happy to answer any questions.",300,,
1229,0.97,8684.208,8687.345,"Thank you so much, council member Pedersen.",301,,
1230,0.97,8687.345,8689.013,Any comments or questions about amendment five?,301,,
1231,0.97,8694.218,8694.886,Councilmember Juarez.,301,,
1232,0.97,8694.886,8704.762,After this I have to go but Council member Pedersen and I had a talk off-line so he knew that I was going to t this question up.,302,,
1233,0.97,8704.762,8712.336,"Yesterday we had what you are dealing with today, 15 amendments and some of them conflicting and having to go through them.",302,,
1234,0.97,8712.336,8734.258,"And, so I had posed to Councilmember Peterson yesterday we had a panel and we had issues that were, there was a motion and a second in discussion amongst the committee and as the chair I felt I had the discretion to ask one of our Presenters to respond to some of the questions that were raised by my colleagues.",302,,
1235,0.97,8734.258,8751.542,"So, what I wanted is for Councilmember Pedersen to clarify . I would want to maintain the discretion and the leadership of the committee chair to be able to make that decision.",302,,
1236,0.97,8751.542,8757.014,"I do not know if it needs to be a rule, but I'm open to hearing specifically what you are trying to get at Councilmember Pedersen.",302,,
1237,0.97,8762.086,8763.02,Thank you Councilmember Juarez.,303,,
1238,0.97,8763.02,8782.073,I have some of the same sort of concerns and questions and would look to Councilmember Pedersen to see if we can add any additional context or sort of the issue that is trying to be solved through this proposed amendment.,303,,
1239,0.97,8782.073,8782.607,Yes.,304,,
1240,0.97,8782.607,8821.012,"So if we are having a committee meeting, so certainly the chair is able to invite guests to the committee table and it is just, when we get the motions in play, that it is not for somebody who is not an elected official to be in the debate because other Councilmembers may feel pressure from that person and it may sort of frees the discussion a little bit since we are there to make the decisions and after we have taken input from various points of view not just those at the table.",304,,
1241,0.97,8821.012,8847.271,And Zuma presents an interesting situation where we are literally talking about contract or an agreement with that entity so it was helpful to have that person therefore technical questions but I would be open to refining the language except for when we are negotiating a contract or an agreement with somebody.,304,,
1242,0.97,8847.271,8849.473,Director handy?,305,,
1243,0.97,8849.473,8871.796,"Yeah, I just wanted to say that the work group talked about a few different scenarios in this case and the one that we talked about most was the case where you have representatives from the Department at the table and you are in a discussion such as this where you have the motions and you are taking questions.",306,,
1244,0.97,8871.796,8883.975,"As written here, the chair could, the path for the chair to then invite a department member to answer a question would be to suspend this role.",306,,
1245,0.97,8883.975,8899.023,"So, this gives the chair the authority to call in Councilmembers or call on legislative staff if they wanted to invite a member of the executive staff or an outside member there would be a motion to suspend the rules in order to allow the discussion or consideration of a motion.",306,,
1246,0.97,8899.023,8901.459,"Procedurally, that is my understanding of what it looks like.",306,,
1247,0.97,8905.863,8906.931,"Thank you, director handy.",307,,
1248,0.97,8906.931,8907.531,Appreciate it.,307,,
1249,0.97,8907.531,8908.766,Any other questions or comments?,307,,
1250,0.97,8909.066,8915.139,"Council member Juarez, and then Councilmember Mosqueda.",308,,
1251,0.97,8915.139,8917.308,Don't we do that anyway?,309,,
1252,0.97,8917.308,8919.744,Do we need another layer of suspending the rules?,309,,
1253,0.97,8919.744,8954.879,"I mean, I could call out many situations as the Council President can as well where sometimes at the table a chair will invite a person that is not a subject matter expert or a department head but is a activist or advocate for that issue where they find themselves the elected, on the committee find themselves having to pretty much debate the guest.",309,,
1254,0.97,8954.879,8958.082,"If that is what we are getting at, I would rather we just say that.",309,,
1255,0.97,8958.082,8974.598,"I want to get out that because ultimately, it Ofãthe chair is the officer of the meeting and can make that call, but I--again, I am struggling with what exactly we are trying to get at, because I think we already have the power to do that.",309,,
1256,0.97,8974.598,8978.402,"Like yesterday, we would not just be limited to contracts, we would be limited to anyone sitting there.",309,,
1257,0.97,8978.402,8986.777,Sometimes we have people who do not really represent a group but have an opinion and are a friend or guest of the chair and sit at the table.,309,,
1258,0.97,8986.777,8994.919,And respond and act like an elected and respond at even to the point of having claiming subject matter knowledge.,309,,
1259,0.97,8994.919,9003.627,"So, I am trying to get at, am I being too candid here, or am I just not getting it?",309,,
1260,0.97,9003.627,9007.898,"Well, let me just try one other way.",310,,
1261,0.97,9007.898,9012.737,Maybe if you could Scroll up a little bit to show the language here so we are all looking at the same thing.,310,,
1262,0.97,9012.737,9017.441,"But, my understanding is that currently what you just described is what the chair, the power that the chair has.",310,,
1263,0.97,9017.441,9022.713,"The chair has the power to acknowledge speakers both Councilmembers and guests, or Presenters of the community during debate.",310,,
1264,0.97,9022.713,9030.654,This would change that to say that no person other than a Councilmember or as allowed by the chair legislative Department may speak.,310,,
1265,0.97,9030.654,9044.034,"So, if the chair wanted to allow somebody other than a Councilmember or legislative--staff to speak, they would need to suspend the rules.",310,,
1266,0.97,9044.034,9047.104,"So, it changes the power that the chair has without suspending the rules.",310,,
1267,0.97,9047.371,9048.506,"Okay, thank You. & GT; & GT; Councilmember Mosqueda?",311,,
1268,0.97,9049.106,9054.578,Thanks so much.,312,,
1269,0.97,9054.578,9059.483,I know Council members that we have a lot of amendments and we want to keep as many Council members on as possible.,312,,
1270,0.97,9059.483,9062.686,"I'm going to say Councilmembers, I am not in support of this amendment.",312,,
1271,0.97,9062.686,9069.193,"I think that idea, and we do have that opportunity to include people at the table that provide subject matter expertise or lived experience.",312,,
1272,0.97,9069.193,9072.696,"Some of these individuals may be from the Department, sometimes we have central staff there.",312,,
1273,0.97,9072.696,9081.205,I want to make sure that Councilmembers still have the opportunity to ask questions of folks at the table.,312,,
1274,0.97,9081.205,9089.38,"As they are considering items, especially from central staff and others who might be subject matter expertise.",312,,
1275,0.97,9089.38,9091.415,And yesterday we could ask about intimidation and feasibility.,312,,
1276,0.97,9091.415,9097.688,"So, I think that attorneys to be, this, I do not think that this needs to be included there in statute.",312,,
1277,0.97,9097.688,9110.267,I do think that there needs to be strong understanding that it is the chairs prerogative of who is at the table and who gets to field these questions.,312,,
1278,0.97,9110.267,9139.93,"I, myself, as Mosqueda knows, had a lot of people at our table when we had a three person committee with another Councilmember when we developed the Council workers bill of rights an the hotel worker legislation that included both employers and workers, and we frequently had folks that we had robust discussions with but it was never my practice to allow for Councilmembers to ask questions in the midst of a vote, but absolutely were at the table as we were discussing items that were open for deliberation.",312,,
1279,0.97,9139.93,9145.97,"But, I just think that it is limiting and I think that we should consider discretion given to the chair of the committee.",312,,
1280,0.97,9145.97,9147.037,"Great, thanks, so much.",313,,
1281,0.97,9147.037,9148.672,Any other questions or comments on this?,313,,
1282,0.97,9151.809,9162.253,"Oh, Councilmember please.",314,,
1283,0.97,9163.354,9180.504,I want to speak on the issue that they're speaking on here and I appreciate Council member Juarez and Councilmember Mosqueda wanting to defer to the power of the committee chair.,315,,
1284,0.97,9180.504,9193.517,I do wish that there was some way to discourage the practice of a committee chair inviting continued debate.,315,,
1285,0.97,9193.517,9199.623,From Non-Committee members once a motion is put on the table.,315,,
1286,0.97,9199.623,9241.465,"I think that sometimes things that might be, sometimes identified as clarifying questions are really just an opportunity for somebody at the table who might feel differently from the committee chair or might--I am sorry, might feel aligned with the committee chair inviting them to make their case again as opposed to truly providing clarifying information and I don't think that is aligned with sort of the rules of debate for a legislative body.",315,,
1287,0.97,9241.465,9269.46,"I do not know if there is a default under Roberts rules of order, but I do wish there was a way that we could conceive of to discourage the use of the chairs discretion in that way and really appreciate Councilmember Pedersen's efforts to thread the needle here as a nonvoting member I wanted to say that.",315,,
1288,0.97,9269.46,9269.96,Thanks.,315,,
1289,0.97,9269.96,9270.961,Thank you Councilmember Lisa Herbold.,316,,
1290,0.97,9270.961,9306.096,"I do want to say that I think that the language here, while I understand the intent and appreciate the desire to find a solution to the thing just described and that comes member Juarez was describing, I think that this language is overly prescriptive and does not actually solve the issue that is flagged because even if this amendment were to pass, and he chair of any Committee who wants to structure the conversation in the manner described by Councilmember Lisa Herbold can suspend the rules and allow for that to happen.",316,,
1291,0.97,9306.096,9320.11,"I do not think that, I think that this is more sort of a Governance style issue as opposed to whether or not it can effectively be regulated or enforced through the Council rules.",316,,
1292,0.97,9320.11,9335.526,"Now, that said, I also think that this could be perceived by some members of the public as being you know, unfairly targeted towards those who may not share your view of the world.",316,,
1293,0.97,9335.526,9382.673,"And I worry about that unintended consequence of Actuallyãyou know, Formalizing a conversation or a debate too much to the point that you are not actually able to have sort of a fluid dialogue and debate about the issue before you and there have been many instances in which hearing from people presenting at the table, whether it is a department representative, somebody from the Mayor's office, or a member of the community, I have been persuaded to think otherwise about a particular issue, and so I think in the spirit of transparent deliberations, I think it is important for us to make sure we're not creating rules that might inadvertently suppress the ability to engage in that manner.",316,,
1294,0.97,9382.673,9414.138,"I know that is not what the intent is and I'm not suggesting that is the intent but I just am really struggling with seeing how this rule, given the reality of how rules can be suspended, will sort of solve the issue that is really truly at the discretion of a chair of a committee and that discretion will be exercised in a manner in which that independent elected official wants to exercise it in this instance.",316,,
1295,0.97,9414.138,9420.878,"So, I do not think that I can support this amendment and its current fashion and but I do appreciate Councilmember Pedersen's intent in bringing it forward.",316,,
1296,0.97,9429.887,9433.857,"Okay, colleagues, as you heard Cuncil member five will have to leave, we still will have a Quorum.",317,,
1297,0.97,9433.857,9437.261,We have confirmed that Councilmember Mosqueda and Strauss can stay on the line until the end.,317,,
1298,0.97,9437.261,9438.929,We appreciate that willingness to do that.,317,,
1299,0.97,9438.929,9450.507,"So, if there are no other questions or comments on amendment five--hearing none, will the clerk please call the role on the adoption of amendment five?",317,,
1300,0.97,9450.507,9453.777,Council member Juarez?,318,,
1301,0.97,9453.777,9454.278,Aye.,319,,
1302,0.97,9454.278,9454.978,Council member Mosqueda?,320,,
1303,0.97,9454.978,9459.65,No. & GT; & GT; Council member Strauss?,321,,
1304,0.97,9459.65,9460.284,Yes.,322,,
1305,0.97,9463.02,9466.557,Chair Gonzales.,323,,
1306,0.97,9466.557,9467.157,No.,324,,

1343,0.97,9558.782,9561.785,"We are getting close to the end, so thank you for bearing with us.",343,,
1344,0.97,9561.785,9567.124,The next amendment is 12 and I'm going to handed over to the director to walk us through this one.,343,,
1345,0.97,9569.626,9570.16,Thank you.,344,,
1346,0.97,9570.16,9571.662,Amendment 12 is sponsored by Councilmember Strauss.,344,,
1347,0.97,9571.662,9584.975,It would limit the topics for public comment at Council meetings and it would limited to matters on the referral calendar and Committee reports on that day's agenda.,344,,
1348,0.97,9584.975,9601.224,It would eliminate the ability of members of the public to offer comment at Council meetings regarding other items that may be included in the adoptive annual work program serving the broadest category currently listed in the roles.,344,,
1349,0.97,9601.224,9607.531,This amendment relates to full council only and does not change the comment in the rules for committee meetings.,344,,
1350,0.97,9613.337,9615.439,"Okay, thank you so much for that, director handy.",345,,
1351,0.97,9615.439,9622.746,"So, this amendment is sponsored by Councilmember Strauss.",345,,
1352,0.97,9622.746,9628.852,I will hand it over to Councilmember Strauss to make his motion.,345,,
1353,0.97,9628.852,9630.053,"Thank you, Council President.",346,,
1354,0.97,9630.053,9638.161,"I moved to amend the resolution as presented on the, presented as amendment 12 on the agenda.",346,,
1355,0.97,9638.161,9638.829,Excellent.,347,,
1356,0.97,9638.829,9644.468,Is there a second?,347,,
1357,0.97,9644.468,9644.868,Aye.,348,,
1358,0.97,9644.868,9649.973,"Council member Strauss, I will go ahead and second the motion for the purposes of discussion.",349,,
1359,0.97,9649.973,9659.483,It has been presented and I will hand it over to Councilmember Strauss to present his argument.,349,,
1360,0.97,9659.483,9660.617,"Thank you, Council President.",350,,
1361,0.97,9660.617,9676.566,This is making the rules for public comment the same at both Council to allow us to conduct our business efficiently and effectively . I think that it is important to keep public comment and to keep it related to the work that we are engaging in that day.,350,,
1362,0.97,9676.566,9684.508,"So anything that is on the IRC, anything on the agenda, due to this change, is too much for some.",350,,
1363,0.97,9684.508,9695.419,I would be welcome to also then a set up public hearings once per quarter or twice a year for people to comment on the Workplan as a whole.,350,,
1364,0.97,9695.419,9703.193,"But as we all know, there are so many, everything under the sun is included in the Workplan.",350,,
1365,0.97,9703.193,9710.934,"It would allow from my perspective, it would allow us to more efficiently and effectively conduct our business.",350,,
1366,0.97,9717.14,9718.442,"Okay, thank you Council member Strauss.",351,,
1367,0.97,9718.442,9719.676,Any comments on amendment 12?,351,,
1368,0.97,9723.447,9725.515,Council member Mosqueda please.,351,,
1369,0.97,9725.515,9733.356,Thank you very much.,352,,
1370,0.97,9733.356,9735.659,"Councilmember Strauss, I appreciate the intent of where you're going with this.",352,,
1371,0.97,9735.659,9741.164,Another that often we get testimony on a number of items that are not on the full council agenda.,352,,
1372,0.97,9741.164,9747.27,I do wonder about enforcement.,352,,
1373,0.97,9747.27,9756.58,We don't really have a culture of Gobbling down the folks who are not speaking to items on the agenda.,352,,
1374,0.97,9756.58,9764.154,"So, is this contemplating also the sort of cultural change that would accommodate but?",352,,
1375,0.97,9764.154,9772.496,And how does that sort of look in 2022 and 2023 of these are adopted in our committees as well?,352,,
1376,0.97,9777.734,9778.702,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",353,,
1377,0.97,9778.702,9779.87,This is already ruled in committee.,353,,
1378,0.97,9779.87,9785.675,"So, in Committee is only what is it--sorry.",353,,
1379,0.97,9785.675,9786.877,You have a clarifying question?,353,,
1380,0.97,9786.877,9795.819,If I might just clarify--Yeah.,354,,
1381,0.97,9795.819,9798.221,That is sort of what I am trying to get out.,354,,
1382,0.97,9798.221,9813.436,"We already have this role in our committee and I just, perhaps I have not seen it in the committees that I sit on and in the way that I chair it, but often we have people who call in and maybe they have a comment that is not on the agenda for that day.",354,,
1383,0.97,9813.436,9815.105,We often do not Gavel them down.,354,,
1384,0.97,9815.105,9825.248,I'm wondering if the concept here is to apply the same rule that we currently have in committee but also is there kind of an expectation that we would be enforcing that in our committees as well?,354,,
1385,0.97,9825.248,9832.789,I can see how culturally that process change for some might be challenging to accept and challenging for us to lament.,354,,
1386,0.97,9833.089,9834.257,"Thank you, council member Mosqueda.",355,,
1387,0.97,9834.257,9838.862,I do believe it is the discretion of the chair or in this case the discretion of the Council President.,355,,
1388,0.97,9838.862,9841.331,I know that we all run our committees a little differently.,355,,
1389,0.97,9841.331,9846.97,And Mike Committeeãvery strict parameters.,355,,
1390,0.97,9846.97,9858.381,And even--I have Gavel down people that I support and a really great example when everyone in the audience stood up and started saying they were out of order.,355,,
1391,0.97,9858.381,9862.185,Even though I--just by way of example.,355,,
1392,0.97,9862.185,9883.173,"And you know, I do think that if another change or we also have the Workplan that includes city council once a year and that is another opportunity for everyone to kind of all things including an exhaustive list.",355,,
1393,0.97,9883.173,9883.773,Yeah.,355,,
1394,0.97,9883.773,9884.207,Thanks.,355,,
1395,0.97,9885.542,9890.68,"Okay, Great.Councilmember Lisa Herbold please.",356,,
1396,0.97,9890.68,9891.281,Thank you.,357,,
1397,0.97,9891.281,9962.185,"The discussion here and Councilmember Mosqueda's questions about the change, the use of discretion reminded me of what my recollection is for the genesis of this change as it relates to full Council and making it broader to include other matters directly related to the Council work program while still, you know, creating some connection to the work that we do was that there was concern that discretion was being used in a way and when you use discretion when it relates to speech you could be creating a situation where an outside observer thinks that you are using your discretion as committee chair to choose the kind of speech that you want to hear and so, I again, a nonvoting member, but just wanting to put that out there as my recollection of why this was broadened in the first place.",357,,
1398,0.97,9965.522,9969.492,"Thank you, I was going to Chime in with that as well.",358,,
1399,0.97,9969.492,9988.978,We had actually made a choice to broaden this largely in response to some concerns about being overly prescriptive and restrictive of people's first amendments rights at full council in particular.,358,,
1400,0.97,9988.978,10048.905,"My worry about this amendment should it move forward is that now we are creating a scenario in which members of the public have no other Avenue to regularly provide or exercise their first amendment rights about other portions of the Council's work program so if this rule is the same in committee meetings and the same at City Council meetings, then it really does restrict a member of the public's ability to make comments on things that may only be Tangentially related or indirectly related to the work that we do on the city Council, or to frankly work that we should be doing as the city council that we are not Prioritizing.",358,,
1401,0.97,10049.205,10049.939,"But, maybe should be.",358,,
1402,0.97,10049.939,10053.777,"And, so I think that, so my concern on this one, while I, you know, appreciate the intent.",358,,
1403,0.97,10053.777,10081.838,"We have all presided over a lot of public comments and I do, I do think that this, this for me, tips uncomfortably in the direction of creating an unintended impact on people's first amendment rights to speak to their government and make their opinions heard on the body of work that we do, whether we put it on the agenda or not.",358,,
1404,0.97,10085.008,10085.909,Council member Strauss please?,359,,
1405,0.97,10085.909,10092.816,"That, and historical information institution knowledge from Council member Lisa Herbold is helpful.",360,,
1406,0.97,10092.816,10105.195,"It not think this--I do believe though, with that said, that the way that we operate full council does create a barrier to conducting our work efficiently and effectively.",360,,
1407,0.97,10105.195,10115.138,So I would just--the way that we are operating today creates a barrier to--elected official--I just have to say that twice.,360,,
1408,0.97,10115.138,10118.475,Because that is how I am perceiving our work to be done.,360,,
1409,0.97,10118.775,10118.975,Yeah.,361,,
1410,0.97,10122.512,10128.118,"And Council member Strauss, I would say that hearing for members of the public is part of our work as elected officials.",361,,
1411,0.97,10128.118,10134.958,That is why we have public comment listed on our agenda.,361,,
1412,0.97,10134.958,10148.438,"So, that is in particular why I am very careful about saying that we are going to move to other items of business on our agenda, because hearing from the public is part and parcel of our business.",361,,
1413,0.97,10148.438,10153.276,"So, I acknowledge that W█E get lot of public Commenters who call in and sometimes it can be up to an hour.",361,,
1414,0.97,10153.276,10166.289,"But, it is our responsibility to hear from those Members.So, I'm hearing that Council member Strauss would like to withdraw amendment 12.",361,,
1415,0.97,10166.289,10169.993,"Council member Mosqueda, anything else that you would like to add before we move onto the next one?",361,,
1416,0.97,10169.993,10179.502,"No, I just wanted to appreciate the conversation and also NOTE Councilmember Strauss's last comments there, which I appreciate as well.",362,,
1417,0.97,10179.502,10189.579,I think that as I have been looking at the rules and things Ofãthank you to the clerks and all of your help to pull up the procedural motions and supporter.,362,,
1418,0.97,10189.579,10207.43,"You know, maybe there is more Council member Strauss that we can do to continue to look at the language about avoiding refraining from speaking adversely about individuals refraining from speaking against one's motives and refraining from disturbing the assembly.",362,,
1419,0.97,10207.43,10209.132,These are items that currently relate to Councilmembers.,362,,
1420,0.97,10209.132,10219.542,"But I think that there is you know, some element there of how we would like to make sure that our decorum continues to be respectful so that everybody can engage.",362,,
1421,0.97,10219.542,10221.144,And look forward to the future conversation.,362,,
1422,0.97,10221.144,10222.378,But appreciate that was withdrawn.,362,,
1423,0.97,10226.583,10227.05,Yeah.,363,,
1424,0.97,10227.05,10230.853,Someone who has spent a lot of time with the rules.,363,,
1425,0.97,10230.853,10264.387,"And you know, I have heard pretty clearly that even if it is speech about a Councilmembers intent or motives or mode of doing business, it is still protected by the first amendment, which is part of the reason why I have not been able to do anything other than encourage people to choose a different way to express their first amendment rights but you know, I appreciate that is an ongoing concern.",363,,
1426,0.97,10264.387,10278.001,Happy to share past legal opinions I've gotten from the city attorney's office so that you all are on the same page as you transition into the next year on that particular issue.,363,,
1427,0.97,10278.001,10286.175,"Unfortunately, even disparaging comments are still protected by the first amendment.",363,,
1428,0.97,10286.175,10286.776,So okay.,363,,
1429,0.97,10286.776,10298.121,"We are going to move on from amendment 12.Thank you, Councilmember Strauss for the ability to debate the conversation.",363,,
1430,0.97,10298.121,10302.592,Next up is amendment 13.,363,,
1431,0.97,10302.592,10307.33,So I'm going to hand it over to Councilmember Strauss to make his motion on amendment 13.,363,,
1432,0.97,10309.465,10310.133,Thank you.,364,,
1433,0.97,10310.133,10317.04,I moved to amend the resolution as presented on the agenda as Ofã13.,364,,
1434,0.97,10317.04,10318.241,Thank you so much.,365,,
1435,0.97,10318.241,10328.685,I will second that motion.,365,,
1436,0.97,10330.319,10335.925,It has been moved and Seconded to adopt amendment 13 as presented on the agenda .0 headed back over to Council member Strauss to address this amendment.,365,,
1437,0.97,10335.925,10336.325,Thank you.,366,,
1438,0.97,10336.325,10339.362,This is Codifying what we already had replaced as Roberts rules of debate.,366,,
1439,0.97,10339.362,10358.881,"The change is from the Roberts and, Mr. Peter, if you could crack me, Justãit is my understanding that Roberts rules is 10 minutes of debate and reduced to five minutes of debate unless all cm's agreed by--minutes while it is five minutes everyone has an opportunity to speak twice to a motion.",366,,
1440,0.97,10358.881,10364.153,"Any motion for amendment, the motion, any motion you mark you get to cracks, five minutes each.",366,,
1441,0.97,10364.153,10365.388,Just want to codify that.,366,,
1442,0.97,10366.723,10367.79,"Thanks, council member Strauss.",367,,
1443,0.97,10367.79,10373.296,I realized that I forgot an opportunity to present on it.,367,,
1444,0.97,10373.296,10376.365,"So, I apologize for skipping that step.",367,,
1445,0.97,10376.365,10379.035,"Dan or Nestor, did you want to add some additional information there?",367,,
1446,0.97,10379.535,10392.615,"I only wanted to address Council member Strauss's question about, about Roberts rules.",368,,
1447,0.97,10392.615,10399.021,I would say that I would defer to this and the clerks who I believe are more expert than I am about what is is that the 12th edition of Robert's rules.,368,,
1448,0.97,10399.322,10400.757,"Okay, thank you.",369,,
1449,0.97,10401.791,10404.127,Is there anything else to add in terms of this amendment?,369,,
1450,0.97,10404.127,10406.963,Before we hear from the deputy clerks?,369,,
1451,0.97,10406.963,10418.841,"Okay, Monica or Elizabeth, anything to add in terms of responding to Councilmember Strauss's question related to debate?",370,,
1452,0.97,10419.075,10419.609,Yes.,371,,
1453,0.97,10419.609,10427.55,"I am not sure that we, we actually brought this up with the deputy clerks and in reviewing edition 12.",371,,
1454,0.97,10427.55,10429.185,You may have done that separately.,371,,
1455,0.97,10430.086,10434.657,Report on the findings?,372,,
1456,0.97,10434.657,10435.458,"Yes, certainly.",373,,
1457,0.97,10435.458,10443.766,"So, yes, as stated, Roberts rules does have some items excuse me, regarding debate.",373,,
1458,0.97,10443.766,10467.59,"It does contemplate a maximum time for each speech and Roberts rules provides that if no special rule is in place related to the length of speeches, a member, having obtained the floor while a debate motion or debatable motion is immediately pending can speak no longer than 10 minutes unless obtaining the consent of the assembly.",373,,
1459,0.97,10467.59,10472.595,And this is permissive through unanimous consent or by means of a motion to extend the limits of debate requiring a two thirds vote.,373,,
1460,0.97,10472.595,10479.168,"So again, this would be a situation where we do not have a specific rule.",373,,
1461,0.97,10479.168,10492.715,"A special rule within our own Council of rules that addresses the limiting of debate as it is for speech, but this would be kind of some general guidance from Roberts rules around this 10 minute Timeframe and then being able to kind of expand with that.",373,,
1462,0.97,10492.715,10506.128,"Unanimous consent, so sometimes the idea that you have Notã that a part of order has not been raised to say we have reached 10 minutes of this particular speech.",373,,
1463,0.97,10506.128,10507.697,Can we move on through point of order?,373,,
1464,0.97,10507.697,10514.237,It would be potentially discovered unanimous consent that the individual be given more time to speak.,373,,
1465,0.97,10514.237,10521.777,"So, I think again, it is rules that you do have available to you, and tools that you currently have available to you, and this would just be shortening that time to a special rule.",373,,
1466,0.97,10524.38,10527.85,"Okay, thanks Elizabeth for that.",374,,
1467,0.97,10527.85,10529.085,Any questions Councilmember Mosqueda?,374,,
1468,0.97,10532.788,10533.756,"Thanks so much, Elizabeth.",375,,
1469,0.97,10533.756,10539.462,Is there any history that we have with our fingertips on this?,375,,
1470,0.97,10539.462,10542.098,I thought it was limited to 210 minute sections per day.,375,,
1471,0.97,10548.604,10549.872,Did they recently change that perhaps?,375,,
1472,0.97,10549.872,10550.64,In the most updated version?,375,,
1473,0.97,10550.64,10551.44,Of Roberts rules?,376,,
1474,0.97,10551.44,10551.841,Yes.,376,,
1475,0.97,10551.841,10561.384,"And then, the second piece there would be the number of speeches on the same day in question per member per day would be twice.",376,,
1476,0.97,10561.384,10563.386,"So again, there is Roberts rules sort of recommendation.",376,,
1477,0.97,10563.386,10569.525,No more than two of those speeches per topic and certainly then you could go to the unanimous consent if there was otherwise provided for at the time.,376,,
1478,0.97,10574.33,10586.976,"'s Elizabeth, just so that I'm clear, the Roberts rules of order currently say that each member has an opportunity to speak twice, which I knew, but the limit is 10 minutes per time for a total of 20?",377,,
1479,0.97,10586.976,10588.444,Or it is 10 minutes total?,377,,
1480,0.97,10591.847,10592.281,Yes.,378,,
1481,0.97,10592.281,10596.118,It does a maximum time for each speech.,378,,
1482,0.97,10596.118,10597.987,"So, no longer than 10 minutes.",378,,
1483,0.97,10597.987,10605.027,Per each speech with up to two speeches on the same question per member per day.,378,,
1484,0.97,10605.027,10606.662,So that is 20 minutes total.,378,,
1485,0.97,10610.866,10611.334,Yeah.,379,,
1486,0.97,10611.334,10614.136,"Excuse me, those are kind of the general parameters of Roberts rules.",379,,
1487,0.97,10614.136,10627.216,"Try to keep things efficient and equitable so that everybody has an opportunity to speak and then also, you know, the overlying role of trying to hear from everyone first before you go through the second round of speeches.",379,,
1488,0.97,10627.216,10640.629,"So, these are all kind of accommodations for how to kind of proceed efficiently through debate especially when you have a subject that is a popular topic for additional commentary.",379,,
1489,0.97,10640.863,10660.516,"Okay, and then Councilmember Strauss's amendment as presented here would modify those general rules and limits debate to five minutes total but still allow for two speeches.",380,,
1490,0.97,10660.516,10668.457,You can do 2 1/2 and 2 1/2 or you can do all five minutes but then he would not get your second speech.,380,,
1491,0.97,10668.457,10669.258,Is that my understanding?,380,,
1492,0.97,10669.258,10670.593,Or is it five minutes per speech?,380,,
1493,0.97,10670.593,10682.104,What is the effect of this amendment terms of total time?,380,,
1494,0.97,10682.104,10686.108,Director handy?,380,,
1495,0.97,10686.108,10691.614,They can continue to have two speeches each at five minutes for a total of 10 minutes.,381,,
1496,0.97,10691.614,10694.417,A total of 10 minutes so we are saving often minutes.,382,,
1497,0.97,10696.819,10697.486,Got it.,382,,
1498,0.97,10697.486,10703.192,That is helpful clarification.,382,,
1499,0.97,10703.192,10715.738,Enforcement is tricky which is probably why we don't normally do it.,382,,
1500,0.97,10715.738,10737.86,"The burden of enforcing this will likely you know, fall primarily to the next Council president but certainly to all of the chairs of committees as well, so for this to have the intended effect it will need to be consistently enforced by both chairs and the Council President.",382,,
1501,0.97,10737.86,10754.376,"Four Council President pro Tem, so I just want to sort of flag that, that is kind of my Pimary concern here is with implantation and not necessarily with intent, but do you want to open it up for any questions or comments?",382,,
1502,0.97,10754.376,10761.884,This is I think a good opportunity to flag one of the items that I had intended to bring forward.,383,,
1503,0.97,10761.884,10782.104,"I didn't because of the--I didn't--I didn't bring it forward for a couple of reasons but one of the reasons was the inability to enforce, we do not currently have the ability to turn off a single microphone of a single one of our colleagues.",383,,
1504,0.97,10782.104,10803.526,"And not that turning off the microphone of one of our colleagues is the best way to enforce the absent--another way to enforce you know, I don't, I don't think of the Council rules generally as a structure that is about enforcement.",383,,
1505,0.97,10803.526,10812.835,"I think that as Council President Gonzales said the last meeting, it is more about a shared set of expectations that we have for one another.",383,,
1506,0.97,10812.835,10820.543,I do not want to lean too heavily on whether or not something can be enforced or not.,383,,
1507,0.97,10820.543,10842.331,"But, in the instances where you know, some of the changes I have been interested in I have wanted to put forward I think they arisen because of the divergence among our colleagues about this expectations.",383,,
1508,0.97,10842.331,10852.274,"So just saying here that you know, I am of two minds on this one again, as a nonvoting member.",383,,
1509,0.97,10852.274,10868.09,I would maybe appreciate the structure and the discipline necessary to limit my speaking to five minutes.,383,,
1510,0.97,10868.09,10880.502,I think that would be helpful and useful and a good challenge towards the goal of being more effective and efficient.,383,,
1511,0.97,10880.502,10898.821,"If on the other hand we identify this because of a problem that we have, creating a new expectation that we are flagging because of a problem that we have becomes difficult to contemplate because then the next thing is really about enforcement of that solution.",383,,
1512,0.97,10898.821,10905.327,"So, not--clear as mud, my apologies, but letting you know what I think about that.",383,,
1513,0.97,10907.863,10909.765,Any other comments or questions on this one?,384,,
1514,0.97,10914.97,10915.271,Okay.,384,,
1515,0.97,10915.271,10917.439,Not seeing any other hands raised.,384,,
1516,0.97,10917.439,10926.148,I think I'm going to go ahead and close out debate and call this one for a vote as well.,384,,
1517,0.97,10926.148,10930.886,"So, the clerk, please call the role in the adoption of amendment 13.",384,,
1518,0.97,10931.186,10932.721,Mosqueda?,385,,
1519,0.97,10932.721,10935.557,No?,386,,
1520,0.97,10935.557,10935.824,Three?,387,,
1521,0.97,10935.824,10937.359,Yes.,388,,
1522,0.97,10937.359,10938.394,Chair Gonzales.,389,,
1523,0.97,10938.661,10939.194,No.,390,,
1524,0.97,10942.064,10943.899,That is one in favor to oppose.,391,,
1525,0.97,10949.104,10949.571,Okay.,392,,
1526,0.97,10949.571,10951.573,Motion fails and the amendment is not adopted.,392,,
1527,0.97,10951.573,10955.444,"And, the bill is still before the Council.",392,,
1528,0.97,10955.444,10957.68,"We have another amendment to consider, which is amendment 16.",392,,
1529,0.97,10957.68,10960.616,I'm going to handed over to director handy to brief us on this.,392,,
1530,0.97,10962.117,10962.785,Thank you.,393,,
1531,0.97,10962.785,10975.297,Amendment 16 is authored by Councilmember Lisa Herbold and it would allow Councilmembers to attend regular special and emergency meetings of the city council electronically.,393,,
1532,0.97,10975.297,10984.707,It would require Councilmembers to provide notice to the Council President 48 hours in advance of regular meeting that they plan to participate electronically.,393,,
1533,0.97,10984.707,11006.729,"Sorry, that is for both the regular or special meeting in the case of a special meeting, that has noticed with less than 48 hours, or in the case of an emergency meeting, the council member simply must provide notice and sort of lift the Timeline on that recognizing those in time sensitive meetings.",393,,
1534,0.97,11006.729,11020.843,"And as discussed last week, the current rules only allow for electronic participation in very specific cases where Councilmember would be entitled to family medical leave, paid parental leave, or paid family care leave.",393,,
1535,0.97,11020.843,11024.847,Those current rules have been suspended during the pandemic to allow for full electronic participation.,393,,
1536,0.97,11024.847,11029.184,"So, this would be an amendment to the permanent rules post civil emergency.",393,,
1537,0.97,11031.754,11037.926,"Red, thank you so much.",394,,
1538,0.97,11037.926,11038.727,"Ester, appreciated.",394,,
1539,0.97,11038.727,11038.961,Okay.,394,,
1540,0.97,11038.961,11041.563,I'm going to move the so we can have discussion about it.,394,,
1541,0.97,11041.563,11045.434,I moved to amend the resolution as Presentedon amendment 16 on the agenda.,394,,
1542,0.97,11045.434,11046.235,Is there a second?,394,,
1543,0.97,11046.235,11047.669,Second.,395,,
1544,0.97,11047.669,11050.539,It has been moved and Seconded to adopt amendment 16 is presented.,396,,
1545,0.97,11050.539,11054.41,I will headed over to Council member Lisa Herbold to make some remarks.,396,,
1546,0.97,11054.676,11055.377,Thank you so much.,397,,
1547,0.97,11055.377,11062.684,"So, my goal with this amendment is to strike a balance between the realities of governing during a pandemic.",397,,
1548,0.97,11062.684,11070.159,"The success that we have all had Telecommuting, and the need to return to our civic building.",397,,
1549,0.97,11070.159,11074.696,I believe that we should really think about how to come back to work in our offices as we are able.,397,,
1550,0.97,11074.696,11082.204,But I also want to allow electronic precipitation.,397,,
1551,0.97,11082.204,11096.218,I understand that hybrid meetings with some in person and some participating Laconically are something we have not yet tested and that this is an area where we might need to find tune after we have some additional experience.,397,,
1552,0.97,11096.218,11118.14,"I think that we do know enough now to know that it's the current rules, which allow electronic participation only for a few number of items of, that sort of meet these qualifying conditions, that is going to be too constraining moving forward.",397,,
1553,0.97,11118.14,11126.048,This amendment allows Councilmembers to participate electronically with advance Únotice given to the Council president of at least 48 hours.,397,,
1554,0.97,11126.048,11137.86,In situations such as special or emergency meetings when the meeting is called within 48 hours and rendering 48 hours bus impossible.,397,,
1555,0.97,11137.86,11147.369,Councilmembers may give timely advance notice Prescribing to notify as soon as possible.,397,,
1556,0.97,11147.369,11153.275,If a Councilmember has failed to give advance notice they can still participate electronically if Council colleagues approved the participation with the vote.,397,,
1557,0.97,11153.275,11164.686,My hope is that this really provides us with electronic participation tools we need while encouraging us to communicate well with each other in advance whenever possible about our method of participation.,397,,
1558,0.97,11164.686,11182.104,"I think that we had discussed in the last committee meeting you know, a sort of a--that we would center around a opportunity, sort of like, you know, like we do with the--calendar.",397,,
1559,0.97,11182.104,11196.051,An opportunity once a month or once a quarter of individuals to come forward and say I know in advance that I am going to need to participate electronically for this set of meetings.,397,,
1560,0.97,11196.051,11206.728,But I felt like that sort of a solution was more rigid than what I was hearing from the committee discussion in the last meeting.,397,,
1561,0.97,11206.728,11209.731,"So, just putting forward this as an alternative.",397,,
1562,0.97,11209.731,11210.566,Thank you.,397,,
1563,0.97,11212.734,11222.077,"Great, thank you so Much.Councilmember Lisa Herbold, are there any comments or questions about amendment 16?",398,,
1564,0.97,11222.077,11223.946,Council member Mosqueda please.,399,,
1565,0.97,11223.946,11228.45,I am having voted to second this.,400,,
1566,0.97,11228.45,11244.666,I want to note Council member Lisa Herbold but I--we could have the debate but unfortunately this is not an amendment that I'm able to support right now and I will let you know why I do appreciate the intent behind it.,400,,
1567,0.97,11244.666,11251.64,I think that there is clearly an interest that we have a more streamlined understanding of what is expected from Councilmembers.,400,,
1568,0.97,11251.64,11265.454,I do think that there are some unintended consequences with this from a equity and public health perspective early on in my first term folks probably remember we did a lot of work with the Councilmembers that are here.,400,,
1569,0.97,11265.454,11278.2,Councilmember Gonzales and Lisa Herbold were very supportive of efforts to make it more flexible so that we could have participation especially for those who needed to take care of kids or elderly parents at the time we had colleagues who were dealing with that.,400,,
1570,0.97,11278.2,11296.718,"I think that Similarly, if we have a Councilmember who needs to participate electronically, whether or not that is because they have a health related issue personally, whether you know, for example in this moment they are worried that they were exposed to Covid or if they have a Kiddo, or a parent that needs care of some form.",400,,
1571,0.97,11296.718,11328.35,"I want them to be able to provide, provide folks with the option to do that without necessarily having to explain to the world why they are participating publicly or participating through these alternative means and I hesitate to support something that has a decision left up to individual Councilmembers to decide what constitutes as a good enough reason for not participating as for traditional means and modes for the committees or for councils.",400,,
1572,0.97,11328.35,11345.233,"So, appreciate sort of the intent behind this and I think that it is important for us to make sure that Councilmembers still have the discretion themselves to determine how to do their job and participate in a meeting.",400,,
1573,0.97,11345.233,11358.246,"I definitely want to make sure we are not creating another you know, unintended situation where Councilmembers also might come to work sick or might participate in a meeting even if it Isãyou know, having the opportunity to participate through new technical channels.",400,,
1574,0.97,11358.246,11371.293,"We want them to be able to be with their loved ones when they need to and not feel immediate pressure to come to a meeting if, if they are nervous about disclosing why and an alternative way to participate.",400,,
1575,0.97,11371.293,11383.271,So I look forward to working with you all to make sure that we are providing clear access for the public to understand how our voting processes are done.,400,,
1576,0.97,11383.271,11400.489,"I do not want us to be in a situation where we create unintended consequences with this and to--the, the amendment right now I think looks like it is taking a step back for some of those important protections that we put into place I think it was early 2018.",400,,
1577,0.97,11400.489,11403.158,"So, for that reason, I would be hesitant to--today.",400,,
1578,0.97,11405.527,11407.829,"Okay, thank you so much.",401,,
1579,0.97,11407.829,11408.43,Appreciate that.,401,,
1580,0.97,11408.43,11412.901,"I do see a few hands raised, at least three.",401,,
1581,0.97,11412.901,11419.474,So I'm going to go in the order in which they were Raised.First is Council member Strauss and then Councilmember Lisa Herbold.,401,,
1582,0.97,11419.474,11423.645,Thank you Council President.,402,,
1583,0.97,11423.645,11426.915,I'm try to clarify here six and seven of these being added?,402,,
1584,0.97,11426.915,11432.988,I would be happy with six but I don't think that we need to have a vote Duringã Councilmembers.,402,,
1585,0.97,11435.791,11446.735,"They are both, yes, they are both being proposed to be added as part of this amendment.",403,,
1586,0.97,11446.735,11476.698,"I am gonNA hand it over to Council member Lisa Herbold and then director handy, because I think that based on that question and based on Councilmember Mosqueda's comments, I think that there might be a confusion about why the rules exist the way that they exist now and so perhaps--addresses that and handy as well so I will not labor the point and recognize Council member Lisa Herbold and then director handy.",403,,
1587,0.97,11479.835,11480.702,Thank you.,404,,
1588,0.97,11480.702,11485.407,"So, I Amãintent Ofãto defer to director handy.",404,,
1589,0.97,11485.407,11518.106,"But, just because I think that Rector handy understands my intent and understands the language as drafted but I want to clarify the language that you see under number seven is just a reordering of the existing language that is currently under not up under but under six, so the current language in under under number six is now placed under number--as number seven in place under the new number six.",404,,
1590,0.97,11518.106,11555.076,"And there is in the circumstances of where a Councilmember is not able to be present at a regular council meeting, there is no obligation for anybody to explain why nor is there under the current circumstances nor is there a requirement to inform the Council president for the reason why they're planning the absence.",404,,
1591,0.97,11555.076,11592.881,I do note that--sure that in moving the language from six we lost reference to rule D4 now which I think that we need in order to address Council member Mosqueda's concern.,404,,
1592,0.97,11621.576,11625.513,We can Tagteam the specific language.,405,,
1593,0.97,11625.513,11632.954,Part of what this amendment says is the this lives in three sections.,405,,
1594,0.97,11632.954,11638.326,"One about regular roles, and special mediums and the rules have a slightly different rules for each.",405,,
1595,0.97,11638.326,11645.266,The intent is provide significant flexibility to Council members.,405,,
1596,0.97,11645.266,11652.707,For any circumstances all that is required is 48 hours of a meeting.,405,,
1597,0.97,11652.707,11670.091,Of a Councilmember was out on an extended period he knew that they wouldn't be with the Council for a month at a time they could provide counsel with notice saying that for the next 30 days I intend to participate electronically in all circumstances.,405,,
1598,0.97,11670.091,11676.765,Tension is not written for every specific meeting to provide that notice.,405,,
1599,0.97,11676.765,11692.681,"If you were normally participating you could provide 48 hours notice that you would be out of town or that you were sick, something that would allow you to participate electronically.",405,,
1600,0.97,11692.681,11704.225,Because of the increased flexibility we chose to strike the language about the paid medical and family leave.,405,,
1601,0.97,11704.225,11712.934,Do want to explain how that is done in the amendment?,405,,
1602,0.97,11712.934,11727.248,For a regular meeting which is scheduled routinely at the day tape day and time.,406,,
1603,0.97,11727.248,11741.563,The expectation is that Council members would provide the committee chair or the Council president in the event that we are talking about the Council meeting with 48 hours of notice at lease.,406,,
1604,0.97,11741.563,11769.39,In the event that that does not happen there is still a provision for the full counsel to vote by majority that would allow the Councilmember to attend electronically if there was a late breaking illness that kept the Councilmember away from an in person meeting.,406,,
1605,0.97,11769.39,11776.097,That is for regular meetings.,406,,
1606,0.97,11776.097,11780.635,If you can Scroll down I'm not sure who is controlling the amendment.,406,,
1607,0.97,11780.635,11782.07,I will just keep talking.,406,,
1608,0.97,11782.07,11848.336,"For special meetings that are called with less time then 48 hours of advanced notice, and that Council members will provide his early notice and has practical, there is still the Failsafe that the full council can take the full vote to participate electronically and the final section is Last- minute meetings, like a natural disaster.",406,,
1609,0.97,11848.336,11861.249,If we could Scroll down to the next section.,406,,
1610,0.97,11861.249,11885.173,"This says before the meeting starts that Council members should notify the Council president of a desire or need to attend electronically, and if you look at item five the same vote that could happen in the event that prior notice was not provided.",406,,
1611,0.97,11885.173,11891.312,That would allow Councilmember to attend electronically.,406,,
1612,0.97,11891.312,11894.415,Thank you Dan and Esther.,407,,
1613,0.97,11894.415,11904.325,Councilmember Mosqueda?,407,,
1614,0.97,11904.325,11907.528,Spoke thank you Councilmember Herbold for clarifying your intent.,407,,
1615,0.97,11907.528,11913.434,Colleagues and friends from central staff that is not how I read this language.,407,,
1616,0.97,11913.434,11918.006,It clearly says for regular meetings.,407,,
1617,0.97,11918.006,11932.253,For any reason the Councilmember may vote on regular meetings as long as they notify them 48 hours in advance.,407,,
1618,0.97,11932.253,11940.061,That is not the same language that was included in 2018 when the information was dated.,407,,
1619,0.97,11940.061,11953.875,"A number seven it says that they cannot presented a regular meeting and if approved by a majority of Council members present, that is the difference from what we currently have.",407,,
1620,0.97,11953.875,11964.185,"Both require advanced notice of 48 hours, and approval by the majority of Council members present and voting.",407,,
1621,0.97,11964.185,11977.799,It does not contemplate that somebody might not be able to give that advanced notice to the Council president for regular and special meetings.,407,,
1622,0.97,11977.799,11982.937,I'm also concerned that it says related to special meetings within 48 hours of notice to the public.,407,,
1623,0.97,11982.937,11989.61,Why is an individual Councilmember required to notice to the public.,407,,
1624,0.97,11989.61,11992.08,Because it doesn't say to the public.,407,,
1625,0.97,11992.08,12009.03,I think that something is lost in the drafting or translation if the Council members intent was to maintain the current flexibility.,407,,
1626,0.97,12009.03,12013.534,"I do not necessarily see that in the language in front of us, and I am not comfortable voting on this version.",407,,
1627,0.97,12013.534,12024.012,I do understand the intent.,407,,
1628,0.97,12024.512,12032.854,But there's been a couple of times where you have or refer to current flexibility I want to remind you that the current flexibility is zero electronic participation.,407,,
1629,0.97,12032.854,12036.057,Unless we change the rules.,407,,
1630,0.97,12036.057,12048.936,The only reason we have maximum flexibility to participate electronically is because the governor issued the proclamation allowing for that to be the case.,407,,
1631,0.97,12048.936,12051.439,Soon as that proclamation is rescinded we will default to the base rules.,407,,
1632,0.97,12051.439,12066.988,The basic rules are extraordinarily restrictive because they only allow a Councilmember to participate electronically in the enumerated situations that you and I worked on in a 2018.,407,,
1633,0.97,12066.988,12083.571,And in the base rules it is currently required that in order to participate electronically you have to get consent from the body to participate.,407,,
1634,0.97,12083.571,12089.644,So the amendment before us is trying to change the base rules.,407,,
1635,0.97,12089.644,12115.236,It's really important that we not compare this amendment to current operations because current operations are in place because of what the governor issued that has allowed us to suspend in the entirety the rules related to electronic versus In-Person participation.,407,,
1636,0.97,12115.236,12147.268,"What we are trying to do is compare this amendment to Pre- Covid life, and how the rules were Pre-Covid with the expectation that someday we may be back in Pre-Covid scenario and want to implement a hybrid model.",407,,
1637,0.97,12147.268,12150.438,In order to achieve a hybrid model that works for everyone.,407,,
1638,0.97,12150.438,12157.245,We need to have some level of notification.,407,,
1639,0.97,12157.245,12159.981,So that I.T.,407,,
1640,0.97,12159.981,12173.394,And the Council president and others can plan for the logistics that are necessary to accommodate a request for electronic participation.,407,,
1641,0.97,12173.394,12186.908,"To the extent that the request for electronic participation requires approval by the Council President, that probably goes a little to far.",407,,
1642,0.97,12186.908,12197.718,I do think that there needs to be some sort of Proactive communication.,407,,
1643,0.97,12197.718,12198.419,Cannot be the 11th hour.,407,,
1644,0.97,12198.419,12207.895,"There so many times where I will get messages within 30 minutes or even 15 minutes of a scheduled meeting about being late, O having technology issues or needing to leave early or change the order.",407,,
1645,0.97,12207.895,12221.943,It is so hard to manage the efficiency without notice.,407,,
1646,0.97,12221.943,12231.919,"And if we want to make sure that people are not being Micromanaged, I agree that we should have language that addresses those concerns.",407,,
1647,0.97,12231.919,12241.762,There has to be some level of notice of a hybrid model of how we are going to do business as a city council.,407,,
1648,0.97,12241.762,12242.129,Post-Covid.,407,,
1649,0.97,12242.129,12255.676,I just wanted to add that for context to the conversation.,407,,
1650,0.97,12255.676,12258.879,I feel that we are comparing what it is like now to this amendment.,407,,
1651,0.97,12258.879,12268.789,And the reality is that we should be comparing what is happening in this amendment to how we were operating Pre- Covid.,407,,
1652,0.97,12268.789,12269.39,Director handy?,407,,
1653,0.97,12269.39,12274.028,Did you have anything else to add?,407,,
1654,0.97,12274.028,12283.971,I do not have anything specific to add.,408,,
1655,0.97,12283.971,12285.106,Councilmember Herbold?,409,,
1656,0.97,12285.106,12305.926,"There are multiple places where this language is inserted, I'm looking in one place I don't believe there is a requirement for approval of the President I believe that language was to inform, and I don't think there is a requirement to notify the public.",410,,
1657,0.97,12305.926,12316.237,There is not an intent to notify the public.,410,,
1658,0.97,12316.237,12320.841,Expect that is in the special meeting section if we can Scroll to that so that we are all looking at it.,410,,
1659,0.97,12320.841,12328.783,That is in case of a special meeting that has been notice to the public with less than 48 hours.,410,,
1660,0.97,12328.783,12335.456,In those cases the Councilmember needs to provide notice to the Council President not 48 hours.,410,,
1661,0.97,12335.456,12340.828,I can understand why that's confusing because they sit next to each other.,410,,
1662,0.97,12340.828,12346.167,The notices about the meeting being a public not the absence.,410,,
1663,0.97,12346.167,12348.002,"It is not absent, it's just electronic.",411,,
1664,0.97,12348.002,12362.95,But I misspoke it's electronic participation.,411,,
1665,0.97,12362.95,12366.42,It sounds like this has more work.,412,,
1666,0.97,12366.42,12372.993,I have my second of a third community event to attend.,412,,
1667,0.97,12372.993,12375.663,So my time is quickly expiring.,412,,
1668,0.97,12375.663,12379.967,In addition to my office hours.,412,,
1669,0.97,12379.967,12384.105,Thank you.,412,,
1670,0.97,12384.105,12386.107,Councilmember Strauss how much longer do we have you?,413,,
1671,0.97,12386.107,12393.614,I have -10 minutes.,414,,
1672,0.97,12393.614,12397.318,I have 20 minutes at most.,414,,
1673,0.97,12397.318,12403.824,But I will not be able to eat before my next meeting.,414,,
1674,0.97,12403.824,12409.53,We will try to wrap this up in the next 15 minutes.,415,,
1675,0.97,12409.53,12417.138,"The good news is that we only have one more amendment and it is yours, Councilmember Strauss.",415,,
1676,0.97,12417.138,12431.952,"Colleagues, I do want to keep us moving.",415,,
1677,0.97,12431.952,12456.177,May I suggest that we do a little bit more work on this one . is that okay with you Councilmember Herbold?,415,,
1678,0.97,12456.177,12458.179,I appreciate the conversation and I think it is important.,415,,
1679,0.97,12458.179,12460.581,I think we know where the issues and concerns are.,415,,
1680,0.97,12460.581,12470.991,And there is a way to make sure that the languages reflective and not confusing and clear.,415,,
1681,0.97,12470.991,12478.466,To create a change from the status quo rules that severely limit electronic participation.,415,,
1682,0.97,12478.466,12480.367,To document some level of flexibility.,415,,
1683,0.97,12480.367,12497.685,"If there is a desire to have the greatest level of flexibility like we do now, that would need to be a new amendment proposed.",415,,
1684,0.97,12497.685,12511.532,This is a middle of the ground approach as opposed to electronic always proposal which was one of the recommendations being put forward by the work group.,415,,
1685,0.97,12511.532,12517.438,I appreciate the need to have more conversation and to make sure that we are all on the same page.,415,,
1686,0.97,12517.438,12523.444,I believe we will get there.,415,,
1687,0.97,12523.444,12525.246,I agree and I appreciate the clarification.,416,,
1688,0.97,12525.246,12529.65,I want to apologize to central staff and my colleagues.,416,,
1689,0.97,12529.65,12539.86,I understand where I was misreading the public aspect and I apologize for that.,416,,
1690,0.97,12539.86,12555.042,I appreciate that we can Finesse this and I look forward to that conversation on Monday.,416,,
1691,0.97,12555.042,12562.383,The approval part is in the base rules and we may want to change that.,417,,
1692,0.97,12562.383,12568.355,If that is the case this is the opportunity to do that.,417,,
1693,0.97,12568.355,12569.356,More to come on that.,417,,
1694,0.97,12569.356,12570.19,I appreciate the conversation.,417,,
1695,0.97,12570.19,12582.069,"The last amendment I'm going to move quickly over to that one, and I will go ahead and move that to amendment 15.",417,,
1696,0.97,12582.069,12589.61,"Director handy can you walk us through this, please?",417,,
1697,0.97,12589.61,12602.723,Amendment 15 is the final amendment today that is sponsored by Councilmember Strauss.,418,,
1698,0.97,12602.723,12607.027,It would set the councils intend to update the Council rules to move to a new session based legislative calendar.,418,,
1699,0.97,12607.027,12620.107,"Similar to one that is used in the Washington state legislator, the legislative calendar would be grouped into multiple sessions.",418,,
1700,0.97,12620.107,12628.282,"Bills have a cut off date and move to full council action, then there would be a break and then there would be a special session for budget.",418,,
1701,0.97,12628.282,12646.433,"If this amendment passes, the clerk's office and the Workgroup would reconvene in January to explore the best practices and logistics related to this proposal and would have the Council consider this change by April 30, 2022.",418,,
1702,0.97,12646.433,12656.877,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Strauss I'm going to hand it over to you to make the motion.",419,,
1703,0.97,12656.877,12665.452,I move amendment 15.,420,,
1704,0.97,12665.452,12675.663,We have a motion and a second as presented.,421,,
1705,0.97,12675.663,12722.342,"But I am here to request your support to allow us to continue, to take the time to explain in particular when we sat down with director handy to discuss all of the different levels that we would have to change our rules in the amount of time it would not have been an appropriate request to make, my request is to allow us more time and set a date certain for when we would return to discuss Council rules regarding legislative session to put parameters on our work so that we are more efficiently and effectively able to conduct our.",421,,
1706,0.97,12722.342,12729.349,Right now we have ongoing sessions.,421,,
1707,0.97,12729.349,12762.449,"What I envision is similar to the legislative session in Olympia where there is time set aside for committee and then you have time set aside for floor action, when I look at how that applies to the city council I imagine two months of committee work and then a month of full council work and floor action for us to understand what is coming out of each other's committees.",421,,
1708,0.97,12762.449,12776.897,As it stands if you're not on the committee you get one crack at it and you feel pressure to vote the first moment that you have seen it.,421,,
1709,0.97,12776.897,12789.81,This will touch on eliminating alternates and some of these other things as well.,421,,
1710,0.97,12789.81,12797.417,I ask to include this in the resolution so that we have more time to work on it and bring you a full proposal.,421,,
1711,0.97,12797.417,12807.628,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Herbold?",422,,
1712,0.97,12807.628,12845.833,"I want to thank the sponsor for Reworking the proposal before us and recognizing the complexity, I think it is important to interact with all of the executive Department and have a full discussion of the schedule implications and the Workflow coming from them to make sure that we are all on the same page and there are no unintended consequences.",423,,
1713,0.97,12845.833,12858.245,Thank you for putting this forward as an item for further study.,423,,
1714,0.97,12858.245,12862.683,Councilmember Mosqueda?,424,,
1715,0.97,12862.683,12867.554,I want to thank the sponsor I wish we could do this next year and I'm happy to work with you on this.,425,,
1716,0.97,12867.554,12879.199,As we have talked about there some great ideas on how we Frontload policy earlier in the year and then moved to a floor action session I'm happy to work with you on that and I appreciate this amendment and the visionary behind this.,425,,
1717,0.97,12879.199,12889.309,If we move towards this and other departments know that this is our time frame it will be a easy Timeline to transition too.,425,,
1718,0.97,12889.309,12897.885,And I are happy to support this.,425,,
1719,0.97,12897.885,12904.858,"Spike thank you so much, any other comments or questions?",425,,
1720,0.97,12904.858,12930.15,"Not hearing anything else, I will go ahead and close this item and get Councilmember Strauss out of here . will the clerk called the roll on the adoption of amendment 15?",425,,
1721,0.97,12930.15,12950.671,"Mosqueda, Strauss, and the motion carries in the amendment is adopted . that is all the amendments I am aware of.",425,,
1722,0.97,12950.671,12969.69,And so we will move to the passage of resolution three two 029 32029.,425,,
1723,0.97,12969.69,12976.596,Are there any additional comments?,425,,
1724,0.97,12976.596,12984.104,We did not get a chance to talk about the ways to better enforce existing Roberts rules in the two-minute allotments there.,426,,
1725,0.97,12984.104,13001.121,"I look forward to discussing that to make sure we have glade or greater clarity on that, I appreciate the work that you've done to get us to this point today.",426,,
1726,0.97,13001.121,13006.626,Like any other final comments?,426,,
1727,0.97,13006.626,13011.098,I want to thank you for all of your engagement in the Council rules.,426,,
1728,0.97,13011.098,13023.71,"This has been a robust process, a lot of the work has gone into analyzing proposals and preparing amendments.",426,,
1729,0.97,13023.71,13035.389,And for that I want to thank the city clerk and staff.,426,,
1730,0.97,13040.394,13049.736,And of course my deputy chief of staff.,426,,
1731,0.97,13049.736,13051.171,For all of their tremendous work.,426,,
1732,0.97,13051.171,13079.299,"For making proposed changes and as always we know that there are couple of things that we will have to deal with between now and Monday, I believe this was in an Porton body of work and I thank you for your engagement and I look forward to taking this backup at the city council for final action this coming Monday.",426,,
1733,0.97,13079.299,13092.813,"Can we call the roll on resolution 32029 to be forwarded to the city council on a December 13, 2021.",426,,
1734,0.97,13092.813,13096.516,"Mosqueda, Strauss, Gonzalez.",426,,
1735,0.97,13096.516,13100.12,That is a three in favor.,426,,
