32,0.97,292.925,299.632,Extending the program will continue to provide businesses with a little bit of product ability as we continue to work toward Permanency.,1,,

42,0.97,364.63,366.132,Is that correct?,2,,
43,0.97,366.132,373.706,There are no further public comment registrants registrants.,3,,

48,0.97,389.222,394.527,Agenda item one.,5,,
49,0.97,394.527,403.035,Seattle Burma transportation and the Seattle public utilities winter storm after action report for briefing and discussion.,5,,
50,0.97,403.035,403.503,Thank you.,6,,
51,0.97,403.503,421.821,I would like to thank some of my Council colleagues for sharing my interest in having both the Seattle Department of transportation and public utilities present what they are calling the after action assessment . This is regarding the winter storms that hit Seattle from December 26th through January 4TH.,6,,
52,0.97,421.821,432.098,I also appreciate the new payroll administration and office for one month agreeing to provide this thorough assessment.,6,,
53,0.97,432.098,445.812,So I know that the administration Prioritizes taking care of the basics for Seattle and we all agree keeping roadways safer all modes of travel and recycling and waste are core functions of government.,6,,
54,0.97,445.812,471.771,"And I do want to thank the city government's front-line workers and the solid waste truck drivers who braved the rough winter conditions to serve the public . I requested that the two departments cover several topics including the clearance of Arterials and side streets and sidewalks and snow and fixing potholes, picking up solid waste, clearing storm drains.",6,,
55,0.97,471.771,484.05,There are two Powerpoint Úpresentations that we will be going through for each Department and they will be here during the entire discussion because some of the issues that Sdot faced infected Seattle public utilities and vice versa.,6,,
56,0.97,484.05,496.963,So I do want to thank Councilmember Herbold also for reinforcing the request to have the (Indiscernible) describe the city's ongoing efforts to mitigate landslide hazards as well.,6,,
57,0.97,496.963,525.524,"Let's start by welcoming the interim director of Sdot, Kristin Simpson and her team as well as the interim Ceo of public utilities, Andrew Lee and I want to thank central staff specifically Calvin chow and Brian good night for their work on these with the Department to make sure we are getting all the information.",6,,
58,0.97,525.524,529.161,"Councilmembers, there will be plenty of time for questions during these presentations.",6,,
59,0.97,529.161,536.969,I think we should try to get through the presentations of each Department and then have questions at the end.,6,,
60,0.97,536.969,543.776,"And if there is a burning question in the middle, that will be okay too.",6,,
61,0.97,543.776,556.455,So when we go ahead and turn it over to Kristin Simpson first.,6,,
62,0.97,556.455,557.123,Good morning.,6,,
63,0.97,557.123,571.904,We are not hearing your Audio yet.,6,,
64,0.97,571.904,572.738,Cannot hear that yet.,6,,
65,0.97,572.738,581.681,What we could do is turn it over to Andrew Lee to introduce first and then director Simpson works ll the Audio.,6,,
66,0.97,581.681,585.518,I know she has a team here from Sdot as well.,6,,
67,0.97,585.518,595.361,So we are well covered here.,6,,
68,0.97,595.361,596.295,"So good morning, general manager Lee.",6,,
69,0.97,596.295,596.762,Hello there.,7,,
70,0.97,596.762,599.899,Bob Hennessey I think will bring up some slides.,7,,
71,0.97,599.899,601.834,"So Bob, I will start the introduction as we do that.",7,,
72,0.97,601.834,609.942,Thank you chair Pedersen--sorry.,7,,
73,0.97,609.942,622.822,Thank you so much for this opportunity to talk about work responding to the snow storm we experienced of the end of last year and extreme weather and tied events that occurred at the beginning of this year.,7,,
74,0.97,622.822,625.091,"As Councilmember Peterson Pedersen mentioned, we will talk about efforts with landslide mitigation.",7,,
75,0.97,625.091,630.329,Can we go to the next slide?,7,,
76,0.97,630.329,636.369,We will be focusing this morning on three areas of service that Spu provides to the city.,8,,
77,0.97,636.369,649.582,"First, Holmes and Dusen who manages collection contracts will discuss the interruption to solve way services that this--that occurred from this January 26 through January 1ST through snow and ice conditions.",8,,
78,0.97,649.582,652.718,And we will talk about the subsequent recovery that occurred during the following two weeks.,8,,
79,0.97,652.718,660.459,"Second, I will go to the flooding and sewer Overflows that were experienced primarily in the South Park neighborhood.",8,,
80,0.97,660.459,666.065,And we had a 10 year storm event that coincided with the King tighter then.,8,,
81,0.97,666.065,678.878,"Lastly, Tanya treat who oversees the engineering and technical services division will right an overview of the city's landslide program as it relates to the seven recorded landslides we had in January, following both snow and ice.",8,,
82,0.97,678.878,690.356,"For this point, I will pass it up to Hans Vandusen.",8,,
83,0.97,692.525,693.492,Good morning Councilmembers.,9,,
84,0.97,693.492,697.596,Thank you for making time this morning for us to review some of the service interruptions and storm recovery we had earlier in the year.,9,,
85,0.97,697.596,698.597,Appreciate the interest.,9,,
86,0.97,698.597,708.874,"From solid waste side of things, as you will recall, there was significant snow on December 26th and then cold temperatures, Subfreezing, for another week after that an additional snow falling during that week.",9,,
87,0.97,708.874,725.357,So that made for some dangerous roads and icy conditions throughout the week and what impacted was nearly all solid waste collections being interrupted for the week of December 27th through January 1ST.,9,,
88,0.97,725.357,748.581,"We did have our contractors out there at times during that week when they could, servicing accounts they could so they ran partial valves and put additional staff on the trucks to mostly service larger sites, multifamily commercial sites that they could access through Arterials and their additional staffing on the truck to access the containers where they could.",9,,
89,0.97,748.581,760.326,And I just want to highlight a little bit what goes into the decisions and the consequences of trying to service and not service during icy and dangerous conditions like this.,9,,
90,0.97,760.326,766.565,I think you can appreciate the operating vehicles.,9,,
91,0.97,766.565,767.633,The trucks are at large.,9,,
92,0.97,767.633,782.848,"25,000-Pound vehicles trying to operate on what is often fairly narrow residential and sometimes steep grade streets with often near just below freezing slick ice conditions and also in Seattle, parked cars on the street.",9,,
93,0.97,782.848,791.457,Those are all challenges they face when they consider servicing and the decision to service is theirs.,9,,
94,0.97,791.457,797.396,And they are enclosed medication with us throughout the whole time.,9,,
95,0.97,797.396,803.769,They will be out there inspecting each neighborhood and each targeted area they need to service multiple times a day.,9,,
96,0.97,803.769,806.906,They are prepared with chains for their trucks and with spikes for their drivers.,9,,
97,0.97,806.906,815.214,So they are prepared to service in challenging conditions and they're looking at the safety of being out there first and foremost.,9,,
98,0.97,815.214,823.155,Certainly they and we and you all are committed to providing high quality service and collecting materials whenever we can and wherever we can.,9,,
99,0.97,823.155,832.464,"Also understanding safety is at the top of the list and there is significant risk to pedestrians and to the public, private property and to the staff.",9,,
100,0.97,832.464,840.472,"So they do need to make sure that it is a safe condition to be out there and not jeopardize or risk public, private or the staff themselves.",9,,
101,0.97,840.472,845.945,So that is just a little context in terms of making those decisions to try to service our customers.,9,,
102,0.97,845.945,862.261,"And then for our on facilities, we have the transfer stations, the Spu staff and those were close for one day on the 26th and then open late Monday and stayed open after that.",9,,
103,0.97,862.261,876.909,They were available during the cold and snowy week for services and for contractors when they needed them as well as for the public for both business and residents if they had access to vehicles and they wanted to or needed to use those stations.,9,,
104,0.97,876.909,882.648,So we maintained that availability throughout the whole week.,9,,
105,0.97,882.648,882.948,Next up.,9,,
106,0.97,882.948,883.515,Great.,10,,
107,0.97,883.515,895.527,"Moving on to the recovery which was basically the subsequent week as the roads did clear up, contractors were out there every day collecting materials on those weeks.",10,,
108,0.97,895.527,897.997,There were some limited spots that remain challenging.,10,,
109,0.97,897.997,904.503,Especially early in the week as the clearing completed.,10,,
110,0.97,904.503,910.609,"So some of those needed to be delayed and in some cases, neighborhoods were delayed by a day to allow us to get as much materials as possible.",10,,
111,0.97,910.609,915.314,And so we were successful.,10,,
112,0.97,915.314,919.418,The contractors on the city's behalf with collecting nearly all the scheduled collections that week.,10,,
113,0.97,919.418,924.223,Over 95% of scheduled collections despite collecting double volume from the prior week.,10,,
114,0.97,924.223,928.027,They were able to remove.,10,,
115,0.97,928.027,935.901,The most challenging element in the situation when we Miss the whole week of collection like this is collecting the recycling that was missed the prior week.,10,,
116,0.97,935.901,940.005,"As we are all familiar in Seattle,'s it is every two weeks.",10,,
117,0.97,940.005,946.078,"So when we run the following week, we are not scheduled to be out there collecting half of the city's recycling.",10,,
118,0.97,946.078,953.419,We did as the contractors to collect what they could to those customers would need to wait for the next regular collection.,10,,
119,0.97,953.419,961.56,"Considering the volume they were collecting on the other streams and recycling, they got about 20% of that.",10,,
120,0.97,961.56,968.233,The other 80% of folks had to wait for the next scheduled recycling the following week and have it collected at that point.,10,,
121,0.97,968.233,974.773,So we call that the off week recycling that wasn't scheduled with additional overtime an additional long hours there.,10,,
122,0.97,974.773,982.081,"With all the other elements they were servicing out, they couldn't get more than that.",10,,
123,0.97,982.081,994.893,"And so that meant by the end of the following week, by January 15, all materials had been collected and any of the small pockets delayed were restored and the additional recycling was collected at that point.",10,,
124,0.97,994.893,1000.566,And so that provided full service recovery at that point.,10,,
125,0.97,1000.566,1001.266,Next slide.,10,,
126,0.97,1001.266,1010.609,"In terms of Spu's activities, and this is a brief summary.",10,,
127,0.97,1010.609,1014.513,"Certainly, we are lead on coordination with the contractors themselves of course.",10,,
128,0.97,1014.513,1018.05,"Also we have downstream facilities, our on stations.",10,,
129,0.97,1018.05,1019.818,"We have recycling, Composting and disposal facilities downstream.",10,,
130,0.97,1019.818,1026.258,"So we play coordination role to make sure the whole system, especially during recovery, is effectively working to move what is double normal volume through.",10,,
131,0.97,1026.258,1029.695,So not a lot of room for extra capacity there.,10,,
132,0.97,1029.695,1044.41,So we have to work closely on that as well as providing internal communication during both interruption and recovery so that everybody knows what is going and what is not and how best we can be coordinated internally and externally.,10,,
133,0.97,1044.41,1046.111,"First and foremost, we are the lead on customer communication.",10,,
134,0.97,1046.111,1058.624,So we have been fortunate to have clot platforms to reach customers by text alerts and by E-mail alerts and social media.,10,,
135,0.97,1058.624,1074.506,"So we have a lot of opportunities to reach the customers regularly on weather services and where the recovery plan is, and what is asked of you.",10,,
136,0.97,1074.506,1077.843,So we are asked to do that throughout the whole period.,10,,
137,0.97,1077.843,1078.844,Where the lead on that.,10,,
138,0.97,1078.844,1079.912,And we have the stations.,10,,
139,0.97,1079.912,1093.025,"We do allow, if we end up having a customer twice, we bring their ways to the station and if they have access to the vehicle unsafe roads.",10,,
140,0.97,1093.025,1101.166,We provide the stations as an overflow and then not charging any of the customers any extra charges when we resume service.,10,,
141,0.97,1101.166,1104.203,So collecting all that with no extra charges during the recovery period.,10,,
142,0.97,1104.203,1108.04,So make sure we have the period down.,10,,
143,0.97,1108.04,1114.68,And then we hold the contractors as possible for effective recovery.,10,,
144,0.97,1114.68,1125.157,So we are reviewing services day by day and making sure all services are being recovered and we are assessing penalties where appropriate.,10,,
145,0.97,1125.157,1129.428,And only minor adjustment if they didn't deploy services from any particular day when that comes into play as well.,10,,
146,0.97,1129.428,1135.601,So we are holding contractors accountable for recovery.,10,,
147,0.97,1135.601,1135.934,Next slide.,10,,
148,0.97,1135.934,1145.644,"In our review of this particular event, we are going into greater detail as we always do with after action.",11,,
149,0.97,1145.644,1147.312,We will have a full internal report.,11,,
150,0.97,1147.312,1152.851,So a high level for the setting.,11,,
151,0.97,1152.851,1160.225,"We--the assessment includes first and foremost, no injuries.",11,,
152,0.97,1160.225,1162.694,Safety is the paramount concern.,11,,
153,0.97,1162.694,1165.764,"As far as we are aware, no injuries to the public or to the staff.",11,,
154,0.97,1165.764,1171.503,I am aware of some vehicle damage.,11,,
155,0.97,1171.503,1179.678,"They were out there trying to collect whatever they could and in some cases, the trucks do slide when you are collecting on those conditions.",11,,
156,0.97,1179.678,1188.086,So there is vehicle damage . So we follow up and provide liability coverage for that.,11,,
157,0.97,1188.086,1194.993,For the most part and then no personal injuries we are aware of.,11,,
158,0.97,1194.993,1198.397,That is first and foremost.,11,,
159,0.97,1198.397,1200.199,"Other than that, the effort was considerable.",11,,
160,0.97,1200.199,1200.866,Collecting double volume here.,11,,
161,0.97,1200.866,1206.838,"As a Councilmember mention, the chair mentioned, this is frontline staff that has been working out there every day for the last two years.",11,,
162,0.97,1206.838,1216.481,"In early January, with Covid-19 conditions Spiking, there was some Quarantining so they did have staffing challenges.",11,,
163,0.97,1216.481,1223.188,"So they were able in January which can be a tricky staffing month, to get full staff out there, overtime hours.",11,,
164,0.97,1223.188,1225.19,And just the context.,11,,
165,0.97,1225.19,1238.136,"Not only are they trying to remove double the volume but the holiday week, post holidays, early January is one of the earliest and biggest volume recycling volume weeks of the year and then you have Úadditional holiday and then they had their hands full.",11,,
166,0.97,1238.136,1249.481,The subsequent rain also created weather materials which takes extra time to collect . So all of that.,11,,
167,0.97,1249.481,1251.883,A couple weeks of long hours for everyone involved on the collections front.,11,,
168,0.97,1251.883,1259.758,We were appreciating the efforts of the staff for making that happen on our behalf.,11,,
169,0.97,1259.758,1266.098,Downstream certainly some challenges as well that we are aware of.,11,,
170,0.97,1266.098,1274.473,The station is pushing to the volume there as well as recycling facilities having to handle what volume which can slow the processing down and be a challenge.,11,,
171,0.97,1274.473,1282.748,Our rail to the landfill had some Landside and options along the Interstate five corridor so that can slow things down as well.,11,,
172,0.97,1282.748,1291.923,"Basically without a lot of room for error, they were able to keep all the M█Aterials flowing and successfully remove the extra volumes and recover.",11,,
173,0.97,1291.923,1297.696,"And then, our assessment of the customer outreach was fairly strong.",11,,
174,0.97,1297.696,1303.935,"For the recovery week, we did increase volume calls for the customers.",11,,
175,0.97,1303.935,1309.374,Certainly below what we have seen in prior events.,11,,
176,0.97,1309.374,1321.586,"So the call center was able to handle those and it looked like certainly during the interruption and then after, our ability to use the platforms we have access to come to notify customers, seemed to go pretty well.",11,,
177,0.97,1321.586,1326.425,So that looks favorable as well.,11,,
178,0.97,1326.425,1326.725,Next slide.,11,,
179,0.97,1326.725,1336.168,"Next steps for us, we will continue to enhance the communication platforms.",12,,
180,0.97,1336.168,1336.935,We learn something every time.,12,,
181,0.97,1336.935,1341.473,We get a lot of feedback from customers.,12,,
182,0.97,1341.473,1351.45,We know where we have robust outreach and sometimes where there are gaps and we are always improving on that and how we use the communication tools for outreach.,12,,
183,0.97,1351.45,1365.964,"And we know that when we have a long interruption like this, that every other week, the recycling is the most challenging piece there in terms of, as I described, we cannot fully collect the off week recycle.",12,,
184,0.97,1365.964,1369.267,And then prior to the next scheduled collection and we know that is a challenge for customers.,12,,
185,0.97,1369.267,1388.019,We are working with contractors to identify any ways we can increase what we collect as well as look at opportunities to notify customers with even more precision about what we are doing so that they know how that particular element is recovering.,12,,
186,0.97,1388.019,1391.49,"And then internally, we are working to firm up some of our policies around customer support here.",12,,
187,0.97,1391.49,1422.821,These are practices we have in place providing free tips at the stations as an overflow and other resources to our customers as they are aware going into it . and then we identify the opportunity to firm up our internal policy and official capture of that so that we can be prepared to share that with the customer to provide additional resources that we think are appropriate.,12,,
188,0.97,1422.821,1423.922,I think that is pretty much it.,12,,
189,0.97,1423.922,1432.097,It sounds like the chair Rcommended we just do questions may be at the end unless there is anything really pressing right now.,12,,
190,0.97,1432.097,1440.806,This is a good point to see if there any questions about solid waste pickup impact.,13,,
191,0.97,1440.806,1447.012,I do want to note that Councilmember Morales joined us at the beginning of the presentations.,13,,
192,0.97,1447.012,1450.582,I appreciate you covering issues of safety and service.,13,,
193,0.97,1450.582,1453.718,As well as cost.,13,,
194,0.97,1453.718,1464.863,You mentioned that we obviously have contracts with companies that pickup trash and recycling and compost.,13,,
195,0.97,1464.863,1468.433,"The overtime, that is covered by the existing contracts.",13,,
196,0.97,1468.433,1477.142,"That is not a cost passed along, correct?",13,,
197,0.97,1477.142,1478.643,That is correct.,14,,
198,0.97,1478.643,1485.15,The collection services are provided by contractors and they are accountable for the full recovery at no additional cost to the city.,14,,
199,0.97,1485.15,1486.885,So we don't incur anything related to the overtime there.,14,,
200,0.97,1486.885,1500.098,"Obviously, we are doing the downstream transportation handling .'s we will have additional overtime cost internally keeping the station flowing for the additional materials just internally at our station.",14,,
201,0.97,1500.098,1500.432,Okay.,15,,
202,0.97,1500.432,1522.153,"And I think we will hear a little bit more about this perfect storm, of actual storms, Covid-19 impact, holiday vacations, extra holiday packaging that had to be picked up and then we will get to the slides about what really happened with the excess rain as well.",15,,
203,0.97,1522.153,1529.294,"Colleagues, are there any questions at this point talking about Seattle public utilities and the solid waste pickup?",15,,
204,0.97,1529.294,1529.794,Councilmember Herbold.,15,,
205,0.97,1529.794,1530.161,Thanks.,16,,
206,0.97,1530.161,1537.769,I just would like to go a little bit deeper into the solid waste service.,16,,
207,0.97,1537.769,1539.437,I think you covered it.,16,,
208,0.97,1539.437,1569.401,"I'm still having a hard time understanding why the overtime routes were only able to collect 20% of the missed collections and the length of the interruptions, given, my recollection is that we, Spu is really good about communicating with the public.",16,,
209,0.97,1569.401,1570.435,About the missed collections.,16,,
210,0.97,1570.435,1581.813,But it just seemed like there was a little bit of a Miss connect about setting public expectations about the length of the missed collection.,16,,
211,0.97,1581.813,1588.119,And what people actually experienced.,16,,
212,0.97,1588.119,1588.72,Sure.,17,,
213,0.97,1588.72,1590.455,I can try to speak to both of those.,17,,
214,0.97,1590.455,1607.572,"During the service interruption, basically last week in December, generally, our encouragement of the contractors is to go and service wherever and whenever it is safe to do so.",17,,
215,0.97,1607.572,1617.282,"And so when we have snow like that, especially in Seattle and then freezing conditions, usually we cannot be sure when we will resume service.",17,,
216,0.97,1617.282,1618.583,That is almost always the case.,17,,
217,0.97,1618.583,1626.391,"And if at all possible, we try to resume service that week and delay it throughout the week to allow us to get all the customer materials served.",17,,
218,0.97,1626.391,1629.461,"So often, we are Messaging to the customers and that is the message.",17,,
219,0.97,1629.461,1644.042,"If you are not able to collect you today, please put it out the following day and we will try to come back the following day and if not the following day, the following week.",17,,
220,0.97,1644.042,1645.243,We try to maintain that Messaging.,17,,
221,0.97,1645.243,1647.045,And so there may be concerned where we are Messaging.,17,,
222,0.97,1647.045,1649.948,"Úwe will try to get at the following day and if not, the following week.",17,,
223,0.97,1649.948,1653.718,So I could appreciate that there could be disappointment if we are not able to come the following day.,17,,
224,0.97,1653.718,1656.321,We were fairly--we do try to be clear on that note.,17,,
225,0.97,1656.321,1664.396,"So if you are a Monday customer, we will encourage Tuesday if we can resume service and then the following Monday.",17,,
226,0.97,1664.396,1669.167,"So to the degree we are able to reach customers, I feel like we Messaged well that expectation.",17,,
227,0.97,1669.167,1676.641,And I appreciate anybody that wants to have the waste removed that week.,17,,
228,0.97,1676.641,1678.309,So I'm sure there are expectations we resume sooner.,17,,
229,0.97,1678.309,1685.116,Hopefully we will be fairly consistent on that.,17,,
230,0.97,1685.116,1687.485,I don't know if that fully covers the second part of your question.,17,,
231,0.97,1687.485,1689.054,So we can come back to that.,17,,
232,0.97,1689.054,1692.924,And I will just answer the first part of the question as well.,18,,
233,0.97,1692.924,1694.092,And others can help out here.,18,,
234,0.97,1694.092,1699.597,That is about the recovery.,18,,
235,0.97,1699.597,1702.5,So I might have Breezed through that and it might have been confusing.,18,,
236,0.97,1702.5,1713.945,"That recovery week, the first week of January, the contractors were out there working overtime with additional staff and did collect over 95% of the scheduled stops that week.",18,,
237,0.97,1713.945,1716.047,So they were very successful in Recvering all the scheduled stops.,18,,
238,0.97,1716.047,1725.457,I also did mention that they were also trying to get unscheduled services which is the recycling from the prior week.,18,,
239,0.97,1725.457,1728.927,So they did beyond the overtime that went into the scheduled stops with double volume.,18,,
240,0.97,1728.927,1733.665,They also tried to reach some of the unscheduled services that week which would have been the recycling that wasn't collected the prior week.,18,,
241,0.97,1733.665,1745.376,And that is what they were not able to do fully pushing the existing fleet and the existing drivers already into additional overtime long hours all week to get the scheduled stops.,18,,
242,0.97,1745.376,1753.985,They are not able to Additionally in that situation collect all the off week recycle which is not normally scheduled.,18,,
243,0.97,1753.985,1755.453,"So yes, they were successful in that recovery.",18,,
244,0.97,1755.453,1756.788,It is just the additional off week.,18,,
245,0.97,1756.788,1761.993,So the 20% is Referencing the unscheduled stops?,19,,
246,0.97,1761.993,1763.828,Yes.,20,,
247,0.97,1763.828,1764.662,And beyond.,20,,
248,0.97,1764.662,1771.836,We asked them to do.,20,,
249,0.97,1771.836,1772.837,"Thank you, colleagues.",21,,
250,0.97,1772.837,1782.747,Any other questions at this point in the solid waste discussion quick there will be time at the end of the Spu presentation as well.,21,,
251,0.97,1782.747,1784.149,Let's go ahead and continue with the Spu presentation.,21,,
252,0.97,1784.149,1788.753,Thank you.,22,,
253,0.97,1788.753,1791.222,I'm going to Segue now to the drainage waste water line business.,22,,
254,0.97,1791.222,1799.497,And I think this actually speaks to the fact that we have had quite a breath of services at Spu.,22,,
255,0.97,1799.497,1802.2,We shift from one service to another as the weather changes.,22,,
256,0.97,1802.2,1805.703,"As I mentioned earlier on January 6th and 7th, we experienced a major storm event.",22,,
257,0.97,1805.703,1809.874,The type we expect only one time every 10 years.,22,,
258,0.97,1809.874,1814.145,That in and of itself would have put strain on the system.,22,,
259,0.97,1814.145,1816.548,"However, generally seven, we had a King tide that was nearly 2 feet higher than predicted.",22,,
260,0.97,1816.548,1821.786,And so that severely impacted obviously the ability our system to perform.,22,,
261,0.97,1821.786,1827.592,The chart on the right-hand side of the graphic shows mean sea level.,22,,
262,0.97,1827.592,1832.964,You can see that.,22,,
263,0.97,1832.964,1838.336,7.5 feet level.,22,,
264,0.97,1838.336,1840.939,And what you see there is kind of a high tide right under 12.5 feet.,22,,
265,0.97,1840.939,1843.808,And this one hits close to 14 feet.,22,,
266,0.97,1843.808,1849.347,And so it was the highest tide in the past century of Seattle's Record-Keeping.,22,,
267,0.97,1849.347,1852.05,That should give you a sense of how extraordinary the tide situation is.,22,,
268,0.97,1852.05,1855.587,"However, what is extraordinary today is not expected to be extraordinary in the future.",22,,
269,0.97,1855.587,1867.031,"Because of sea level rise, the King tide we saw last month projected to be the level of Standard monthly high tides by 2060 Hiq to 2070.",22,,
270,0.97,1867.031,1868.6,So that is a big concern.,22,,
271,0.97,1868.6,1876.708,"In the event that we saw generally seven, the tide peaked just at the point where the drainage system and combined system were at maximum capacity from rainfall.",22,,
272,0.97,1876.708,1887.418,"As you can see from the picture on the left, the combination of the snow melt and the storm, plus the extraordinary King tide produced Substanial flooding and South park.",22,,
273,0.97,1887.418,1891.022,We also have had sewer Backups in a residential section of South Park which I will show on a map on the next slide.,22,,
274,0.97,1891.022,1895.927,If we go to the next slide now.,22,,
275,0.97,1895.927,1899.03,So this is a map of the South Park area.,23,,
276,0.97,1899.03,1905.203,You can see the the warmish on the upper right-hand side of the map.,23,,
277,0.97,1905.203,1911.442,The blue areas of the map show approximate flooded areas for South Park January 6 and 7.,23,,
278,0.97,1911.442,1916.514,You can see the convergence of certain intersections there that the flooding was severe.,23,,
279,0.97,1916.514,1924.989,I want to pause for a moment to say that South Park has both Stormwater issues that are shown in the blue.,23,,
280,0.97,1924.989,1926.157,They also have sewer issues.,23,,
281,0.97,1926.157,1929.494,The sewer issues are primarily shown by the Red ducks that you see where it says sewer Backups.,23,,
282,0.97,1929.494,1950.481,"So you can kind of see on the right-hand side of the map, especially on South Canyon Street between Seventh and eighth, there is kind of a prevalence of sewer Backups that we Expensed on January 7th and the sixth.",23,,
283,0.97,1950.481,1954.018,"With respect to the sewer system, there is an East-West line at the top of the map.",23,,
284,0.97,1954.018,1955.453,These are King County combined sewer pipes.,23,,
285,0.97,1955.453,1961.492,"On generally seven, the King County pipes as well as the Spu pipes on eighth Avenue South were full because of heavy rain.",23,,
286,0.97,1961.492,1970.902,The system is designed to overflow into the due warmish when it is full and that is a combined overflow.,23,,
287,0.97,1970.902,1976.04,"Because the tides were so high, the system couldn't overflow as it was designed.",23,,
288,0.97,1976.04,1987.819,"And in that situation, instead of overflowing, the sewer system backed up and you can see the incident was a sewer backup at the intersection of canyon and eighth.",23,,
289,0.97,1987.819,1992.623,Our crews responded to these issues.,23,,
290,0.97,1992.623,1997.695,"And under normal conditions, they could alleviate the issues by pumping flow out to another location in the system.",23,,
291,0.97,1997.695,2003.234,"But under these conditions, there was actually no were to pump to.",23,,
292,0.97,2003.234,2003.901,Everything was full.,23,,
293,0.97,2003.901,2010.141,We had to wait for the rain and the tide to subside in order to reduce the impact to the community.,23,,
294,0.97,2010.141,2020.151,"Spu staff, myself included in King County staff for on-site and South Park January 7 to meet with impacted customers.",23,,
295,0.97,2020.151,2022.787,And this included connecting them with accommodations and cleanup services.,23,,
296,0.97,2022.787,2033.631,I will say that I was able to walk to the neighborhood and meet with some of the residents the day after the rain event and high tide occurred before the tide had actually receded.,23,,
297,0.97,2033.631,2036.134,And I came away with several impressions.,23,,
298,0.97,2036.134,2039.17,The first impression I came away with was that the community is incredibly resilient.,23,,
299,0.97,2039.17,2044.675,They know how to get through these events because they have experienced them and they support one another.,23,,
300,0.97,2044.675,2053.117,The second is that we have some projects that are underway right now and I was glad that we have moved to try to execute on those projects and I wish we had done them even sooner.,23,,
301,0.97,2053.117,2060.758,The third is that we have a gap in terms of sewer system and dealing with the tide issue.,23,,
302,0.97,2060.758,2068.266,And that is where we need to have a solid partnership with King County to address the gap in terms of the sewer and the high tide.,23,,
303,0.97,2068.266,2073.237,Let's go to the next slide.,23,,
304,0.97,2073.237,2074.405,Slide number 10.,23,,
305,0.97,2074.405,2084.048,I would like to shift to a little bit more about how we are addressing these issues and how we have worked historically to address them and I will start with the sewer system.,23,,
306,0.97,2084.048,2093.09,"In 2016 until 2017, we created a sewer improvement project at 14th and Concord to reduce the severity of sewer Backups and South park.",23,,
307,0.97,2093.09,2097.061,"You hear me say this a number of time but under normal conditions, the project would have helped.",23,,
308,0.97,2097.061,2101.199,"However, the high tide, because of the high tide, the benefits were minimized.",23,,
309,0.97,2101.199,2113.377,"Since 2016 and 2710--2017, we installed (Indiscernible) an we did another push on Backflow prevention on private property.",23,,
310,0.97,2113.377,2120.151,I believe that effort was helpful at reducing the severity of the sewer Backups.,23,,
311,0.97,2120.151,2123.988,"However, Backflow Preventers are not foolproof.",23,,
312,0.97,2123.988,2126.691,And they typically require maintenance and sometimes there is leakage through them.,23,,
313,0.97,2126.691,2133.564,"In the summer of 2021, the last year, King County identified a sewer construction in one of the pipelines.",23,,
314,0.97,2133.564,2140.438,We work together with them to remove that constriction and completed it in the fall of last year.,23,,
315,0.97,2140.438,2143.674,Under normal conditions come that should have helped to reduce the Backups.,23,,
316,0.97,2143.674,2147.144,"But because of the tide, he likely did not reduce it very much.",23,,
317,0.97,2147.144,2152.783,"Lastly, King County has a regulator station that you can see on the right-hand side of the map.",23,,
318,0.97,2152.783,2158.556,And they can adjust the level of the water in the sewer system and can reduce overflow.,23,,
319,0.97,2158.556,2163.394,Also can reduce the frequency of Backups.,23,,
320,0.97,2163.394,2170.635,They made adjustments last year and are continuing to make adjustments to reduce the frequency of Backups to the residents.,23,,
321,0.97,2170.635,2174.438,"But again, normal conditions probably would have helped.",23,,
322,0.97,2174.438,2176.774,"But in a high tide situation, very minimal benefit.",23,,
323,0.97,2176.774,2190.955,"Switching over to the storm system, and the storm system is really the cause of the big intersection flooding or the street flooding that you saw in the previous picture, I'm excited that this year, we will complete the salt park pump station project.",23,,
324,0.97,2190.955,2195.259,That will enable us to pump out Stormwater from the neighborhood into the river during the high tide.,23,,
325,0.97,2195.259,2202.633,So this pump station is shown in the yellow circle at the top of the map.,23,,
326,0.97,2202.633,2205.403,And so it will be exciting.,23,,
327,0.97,2205.403,2209.707,But those pictures with flooding in the streets will be significantly relieved when that pump station comes along.,23,,
328,0.97,2209.707,2216.347,This will counter affect the high tide for the storm sewer system.,23,,
329,0.97,2216.347,2221.652,"Next year, and partnership with Sdot, we are completing the first phase of Street and drainage improvements in the South Park industrial area.",23,,
330,0.97,2221.652,2224.789,This is shown on the red lines.,23,,
331,0.97,2224.789,2237.468,There is more work to be done and we look forward to potential opportunities to expand this work to more streets and potentially with the impetus on the Infra- structure built funding that will come from the Federal Government.,23,,
332,0.97,2237.468,2247.178,"Lastly, the Orange Diamond shows where we are planning to build a water quality facility to reduce pollution and storm water before it enters the Duwamish.",23,,
333,0.97,2247.178,2250.982,"So before we pump it out, we will still put the pump station Online probably the spring of this year.",23,,
334,0.97,2250.982,2255.486,"Before we pump it out, we would like to have it treated.",23,,
335,0.97,2255.486,2263.694,So this project will involve property acquisitions like site cleanup and we hope to complete the project before 2030.,23,,
336,0.97,2263.694,2264.195,Next slide.,23,,
337,0.97,2264.195,2270.001,"And so in closing, we are Hearingcommunity needs.",23,,
338,0.97,2270.001,2273.204,I would love to move quicker and look at opportunities to move quicker.,23,,
339,0.97,2273.204,2278.876,We also have an important obligation to address the tide situation.,23,,
340,0.97,2278.876,2279.877,This is a long-term issue.,23,,
341,0.97,2279.877,2284.315,We are already seeing some of the effects of it right now.,23,,
342,0.97,2284.315,2287.385,We have other partnerships underway to help South park.,23,,
343,0.97,2287.385,2293.858,We have one with the office of Sustainability and the environment and the office of planning and community in development and economic development along with other Stakeholders.,23,,
344,0.97,2293.858,2295.826,We are in the early phases of planning.,23,,
345,0.97,2295.826,2309.14,The intent is that the collaborative effort will help to address infrastructure gaps as well as sea level rise and it will be something where we are empowering the community to make decisions.,23,,
346,0.97,2309.14,2311.575,Lastly I mentioned the King County partnership.,23,,
347,0.97,2311.575,2318.849,We are actively working together with King county in a productive partnership and we will continue to do that to address things like the tide issue.,23,,
348,0.97,2318.849,2326.957,"And so I will stop at this point and if there are any questions, I can field those before we move on to the last slide portion.",23,,
349,0.97,2326.957,2340.438,Thank you for that thorough presentation on the challenges we face and also the projects that you have underway to address those challenges as we see rising water levels and increasing storm events.,24,,
350,0.97,2340.438,2340.938,Councilmember Herbold.,24,,
351,0.97,2340.938,2349.914,Thank you.,25,,
352,0.97,2349.914,2369.533,"I want to show my projection for the work that Seattle public utilities did down and South Park during this time, especially in the willingness and availability to go in and meet with people door to door and folks that were experiencing the impact of these events in their homes.",25,,
353,0.97,2369.533,2373.738,We really appreciate that.,25,,
354,0.97,2373.738,2392.757,"I'm wondering, how does Spu make a determination of when they will address a site visit.",25,,
355,0.97,2393.824,2406.303,There was some coordination with my office around whether or not it was King County who should be working with folks or Spu.,25,,
356,0.97,2406.303,2421.886,"And again, I really appreciate Spu's willingness to go out there and talk to folks when perhaps the site visits were more appropriately done by King County because it was more focused on the sewer issues.",25,,
357,0.97,2421.886,2423.621,But just wondering if you can talk a little bit about that.,25,,
358,0.97,2423.621,2438.702,"Also, I would be interested to know, I heard you say loud and clear that the pump station will help with the storm water issues but not prevent or address sewer Backups.",25,,
359,0.97,2438.702,2451.215,I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more about what we should be seeking from King County to stop the impact.,25,,
360,0.97,2451.215,2467.231,"With respect to the first question on, what is our policy with respect to cleanup assistance to customers, I would be the first to say that I think we need a more clear policy on this.",26,,
361,0.97,2467.231,2475.472,"Under normal conditions, the way we were intending to operate this were the connections where the residences are directly connected to the county system.",26,,
362,0.97,2475.472,2482.813,They would work with the county to address any sort of housing situations or cleanup issues.,26,,
363,0.97,2482.813,2489.186,And then parts of the system that were directly connected to Spu would work with us.,26,,
364,0.97,2489.186,2493.29,So that is a responsibility depending on whose system they are connected to.,26,,
365,0.97,2493.29,2502.266,"We identified that we have means under emergency situations to provide people with things like accommodations, cleanup, et cetera as opposed to getting them to work with the claims process.",26,,
366,0.97,2502.266,2506.971,Which typically takes more time and put more burden on the property and the residents.,26,,
367,0.97,2506.971,2511.342,So we did exercise that during this particular ownership with the county.,26,,
368,0.97,2511.342,2518.182,"Bottom line on that is, I think clarity is important.",26,,
369,0.97,2518.182,2525.99,So it was one of my requests immediately after the storm event to put a policy together on this or we can have that consistency in the future.,26,,
370,0.97,2525.99,2535.065,"With respect to your second question on working together with the county to address the high tide issue, I think that is an ongoing effort.",26,,
371,0.97,2535.065,2543.574,I have been having a lot of conversations together with the county and I would say there is a good commitment on both of our parts to address the issue.,26,,
372,0.97,2543.574,2550.781,It is likely going to be a capital project that will take some time to implement.,26,,
373,0.97,2550.781,2559.256,We don't know the scope or the scale of that but we will initiate some planning work on that and work together and partnership with the community as well.,26,,
374,0.97,2559.256,2563.427,So there is more to come on that but I don't have a specific Timeline or project.,26,,
375,0.97,2563.427,2567.798,Just knowing that we will plan on doing something.,26,,
376,0.97,2567.798,2571.869,So a quick follow-up.,27,,
377,0.97,2571.869,2586.817,"You reminded me also, I wanted to thank you for your willingness to work with my office with helping folks navigate the claims process after the fact.",27,,
378,0.97,2586.817,2587.384,Really appreciate that.,27,,
379,0.97,2587.384,2591.422,Appreciate you giving us information to share with the public and when we sin people your way (Indiscernible),27,,
380,0.97,2591.422,2594.458,Thank you.,28,,
381,0.97,2594.458,2602.499,Thank you.,29,,
382,0.97,2602.499,2608.739,"General manager week, I think we can move on to the Seattle Department of transportation part of the presentation if Spu is able to stick around.",29,,
383,0.97,2608.739,2615.112,That would be great in case we have some Crosscutting questions to ask.,29,,
384,0.97,2615.112,2619.75,We have a few more slides related to landslides.,30,,
385,0.97,2619.75,2629.36,"At this point, I will stagnate--Segue over to Tonya treat which should be relatively quick.",31,,
386,0.97,2629.36,2630.26,"Thank you, Andrew.",32,,
387,0.97,2630.26,2631.061,Thank you Councilmember.,32,,
388,0.97,2631.061,2639.036,I want to talk about Spu and some landslide response as well as Spu's work.,32,,
389,0.97,2639.036,2644.842,"This is also related to rain, as you might have noticed.",32,,
390,0.97,2644.842,2651.181,So it is kind of a Segue into the next project.,32,,
391,0.97,2651.181,2654.685,"So across city departments, we know landslides are a very real risk.",32,,
392,0.97,2654.685,2658.355,We work together and we perform a consistent set of activities.,32,,
393,0.97,2658.355,2659.523,I will go over three topics.,32,,
394,0.97,2659.523,2664.595,The first is citywide landslide preparation and coordination.,32,,
395,0.97,2664.595,2668.232,The second is the citywide landslide production.,32,,
396,0.97,2668.232,2670.501,The third is a little bit about the Spu landslide program.,32,,
397,0.97,2670.501,2681.145,So Spu is a designated lead for an annual citywide coordination work which happens at the beginning of the wet season which is typically the last week of October or early November.,32,,
398,0.97,2681.145,2687.017,"At this workshop, everybody gets together, and all the leads for landslide work across seven different departments including law.",32,,
399,0.97,2687.017,2695.459,"And at the workshop, we have all the contact list updated and make sure all the information is correct.",32,,
400,0.97,2695.459,2701.665,"We have a clear understanding of what the protocols are and shared approaches and tools, et cetera.",32,,
401,0.97,2701.665,2707.805,So that is what we do on an annual basis to make sure we are ready for the wet season.,32,,
402,0.97,2707.805,2711.975,"During the wet weather months, Spu is also the lead for sending out a weekly notification.",32,,
403,0.97,2711.975,2718.949,Sometimes it is more frequent depending on the precipitation events that occur or are anticipated.,32,,
404,0.97,2718.949,2725.522,The weekly E-mail tells us where we are with landslide threshold and I will talk about that on the next slide.,32,,
405,0.97,2725.522,2735.466,"Basically, it is essentially, what is the risk coming into the upcoming weekend and week.",32,,
406,0.97,2735.466,2741.572,"When there is a landslide, the first, the health and safety Department, fire and police respond immediately.",32,,
407,0.97,2741.572,2742.773,Although departments do quick research.,32,,
408,0.97,2742.773,2743.874,"Sooner notified, we look at the systems.",32,,
409,0.97,2743.874,2754.885,"We figure out what the impact is to the infrastructure . So before Spu visits, we look at the landslide history and the geology of the area.",32,,
410,0.97,2754.885,2758.255,Any information we have about infrastructure that might be impacted.,32,,
411,0.97,2758.255,2772.636,"And then during the landslide, coordination among city departments is usually via phone usually the primary departments are Spu, Sdot, parks.",32,,
412,0.97,2772.636,2776.006,A lot of things happen with parks because they have a lot of vegetative steep slope areas.,32,,
413,0.97,2776.006,2786.183,"Lastly, any Department enters data into a Database run by the city OEM which is called web Eoc.",32,,
414,0.97,2786.183,2787.217,So that is something tracked.,32,,
415,0.97,2787.217,2792.189,Usually the lead Department has information.,32,,
416,0.97,2792.189,2797.161,Any of the apartments working on it and the staff have access to go enter updated information about the slide itself.,32,,
417,0.97,2797.161,2800.864,So that is always available.,32,,
418,0.97,2800.864,2806.336,Moving to the next slide.,32,,
419,0.97,2806.336,2807.738,How do we predict landslides in the city?,32,,
420,0.97,2807.738,2815.579,The graph on your right is the way that we measure with the level of risk is.,32,,
421,0.97,2815.579,2828.058,"The graph plots the most recent days of humility of presentation on the Y axis and the horizontal, we have the 15 days cumulative rainfall that proceeds the three days.",32,,
422,0.97,2828.058,2831.461,And there is a method to this madness.,32,,
423,0.97,2831.461,2845.309,So the Usgs in 2006 did a historical look at where the landslides were happening and what the precipitation conditions were and came up with this line.,32,,
424,0.97,2845.309,2847.778,"If you are to the right of the line, you are at higher risk.",32,,
425,0.97,2847.778,2861.225,So the graph you see in front of you is from January 7. this is the one that Spu sent out notifying departments that you want to be on alert . We are pretty high above the landslide threshold.,32,,
426,0.97,2861.225,2866.763,And the one you are seeing right now is fairly atypical.,32,,
427,0.97,2866.763,2869.733,I have been seeing these are probably the last 10 years.,32,,
428,0.97,2869.733,2874.638,And it was a pretty high one in terms of cumulative rainfall.,32,,
429,0.97,2874.638,2883.247,"As you know, over that weekend, generally Seventh until January 10th, there were about seven recorded initially.",32,,
430,0.97,2883.247,2888.552,"And in the subsequent days, there were repeat landslides in the same area.",32,,
431,0.97,2888.552,2898.762,So the number is probably more like (Indiscernible) and you will see that in the reporting coming up.,32,,
432,0.97,2898.762,2902.266,So we had seven landslides.,32,,
433,0.97,2902.266,2917.147,"On that day, Spu staff on call, they looked at the area to figure out what they needed to find out about and wet roads were impacted and what infrastructure might be impacted.",32,,
434,0.97,2917.147,2918.148,And visited the site.,32,,
435,0.97,2918.148,2922.452,I had multiple teams go out there to take a look for different things.,32,,
436,0.97,2922.452,2923.02,Different infrastructure.,32,,
437,0.97,2923.02,2926.657,It indicated that we didn't have any issues.,32,,
438,0.97,2926.657,2934.931,"So basically, Stic took the lead on this one.",32,,
439,0.97,2934.931,2940.37,And the house was unfit to go into.,32,,
440,0.97,2940.37,2942.339,And that was the (Indiscernible) specific site that I mentioned here.,32,,
441,0.97,2942.339,2949.279,None of the other seven sites impacted the Spu infrastructure.,32,,
442,0.97,2949.279,2950.347,So kind of unusual.,32,,
443,0.97,2950.347,2960.157,But it was nice so we didn't have to actually deploy any temporary or immediate fixes or emergency contracting to get things done.,32,,
444,0.97,2960.157,2961.325,Next slide.,32,,
445,0.97,2961.325,2962.96,A little bit about the landslide programs.,33,,
446,0.97,2962.96,2967.965,This is kind of informational.,33,,
447,0.97,2967.965,2971.601,What we call the program is the landslide prone area or Lpa for short.,33,,
448,0.97,2971.601,2972.636,We focus on these areas.,33,,
449,0.97,2972.636,2977.174,They are active known slide areas that pose risk to our assets.,33,,
450,0.97,2977.174,2980.577,"For us, it is typically in the Right-Of-Way because that is where the infrastructure is typically located.",33,,
451,0.97,2980.577,2988.452,A lot of times it is streets that are a Right-Of-Way.,33,,
452,0.97,2988.452,3008.905,So what we do in the program is we make potential issues by improving Stormwater systems and drains collection where there are issues with Stormwater adding load to a slide area that could exacerbate or create a slide.,33,,
453,0.97,3008.905,3021.184,"We are currently setting a new approach for monitoring using satellites and that is something that when we get going, it might be helpful with the citywide scale.",33,,
454,0.97,3021.184,3023.353,It gives you retroactive soil movement.,33,,
455,0.97,3023.353,3030.594,You can go back two years or go back seven years depending on how much you get.,33,,
456,0.97,3030.594,3032.295,And how much you want to pay for.,33,,
457,0.97,3032.295,3034.03,Basically it shows horizontal and vertical movement.,33,,
458,0.97,3034.03,3040.737,You can track the satellites as opposed to some of the other traditional infrastructure we use.,33,,
459,0.97,3040.737,3042.172,And so the landslide program is relatively small.,33,,
460,0.97,3042.172,3051.581,"We have a component that is about $100,000.",33,,
461,0.97,3051.581,3052.249,Spent on capital improvements.,33,,
462,0.97,3052.249,3056.72,Some of it is Proactive and some of it is a Reactive if we have a landslide.,33,,
463,0.97,3056.72,3058.255,That depends on activity throughout the years.,33,,
464,0.97,3058.255,3059.089,I'm going to stop there.,33,,
465,0.97,3059.089,3065.695,I do want to acknowledge that Sdot was requested to respond to some specific issues around Highland Parkway.,33,,
466,0.97,3065.695,3068.265,They will cover that in their slide presentation.,33,,
467,0.97,3068.265,3074.271,We did not have a role in that slide.,33,,
468,0.97,3074.271,3076.306,So that is why I'm not speaking about it here.,33,,
469,0.97,3076.306,3081.912,But I do want to know if we have any questions.,33,,
470,0.97,3081.912,3084.247,"Thank you, Tanya.",34,,
471,0.97,3084.247,3084.748,Councilmember Herbold.,34,,
472,0.97,3084.748,3088.585,Thank you.,35,,
473,0.97,3088.585,3092.122,We appreciate Spu addressing this issue broadly.,35,,
474,0.97,3092.122,3112.943,"And my request originated around the experiences of the constituents in district 1 who live in the area of Highland park and like most people, since it is a Detour route, travel through that area.",35,,
475,0.97,3112.943,3120.884,But my question is for both Spu and Sdot which will come later.,35,,
476,0.97,3120.884,3135.732,They are not specifically about the drive . But how we identify locations at risk of landslides and monitor them and try to mitigate those risks.,35,,
477,0.97,3135.732,3143.874,"On the slide about Spu, I think it was the Lpa program.",35,,
478,0.97,3143.874,3158.488,"I know that Sdot, I understood you to say that it was focused on identifying locations where there are risks to Spu assets.",35,,
479,0.97,3158.488,3171.134,And there also is an mitigation Prioritization lists and I will direct my question specifically about how that list is managed to Sdot.,35,,
480,0.97,3171.134,3179.242,But I'm wondering how many locations are on the Spu Lpa list?,35,,
481,0.97,3179.242,3204.501,And do you Cross-Reference or do an overlap with Spu on the landslide list as a way of--one of the issues we have found with the Sdot program is that there is a certain level of investment that I think is needed to do mitigation programs.,35,,
482,0.97,3204.501,3217.547,"And lessen the likelihood that landslides will occur rather than--as Sdot is to--Spu is doing, protecting infrastructure for when they do occur.",35,,
483,0.97,3217.547,3225.121,"And so I'm just thinking, the Sdot Prioritization list was created back in 1997.",35,,
484,0.97,3225.121,3238.668,There is a certain amount of investment that is needed to address the locations on the list and we are definitely not keeping up with the investment necessarily.,35,,
485,0.97,3238.668,3260.557,"And wondering that if we were to overlay Sdot locations with the Spu locations, might that be a way to, given that we have limited resources to mitigate the likelihood of landslides happening, might that be a way to focus our efforts, if you are not already doing that?",35,,
486,0.97,3260.557,3267.23,Thank you.,36,,
487,0.97,3267.23,3271.334,That is a great question.,36,,
488,0.97,3271.334,3278.074,"I would say on the base of it because infrastructure is in the Right-Of-Way, there is an automatic time.",36,,
489,0.97,3278.074,3287.017,Anything that will impact our types generally speaking will impact the pavement of the.,36,,
490,0.97,3287.017,3291.454,So an improved Right-Of-Way would likely be over--overlay.,36,,
491,0.97,3291.454,3293.156,"And unimproved, a lot of them are on improved Right-Of-Way's.",36,,
492,0.97,3293.156,3299.396,It could be come to the extent that we do in overlay of the Prioritization.,36,,
493,0.97,3299.396,3300.497,I currently can't answer that question.,36,,
494,0.97,3300.497,3306.002,Maybe Sdot has somebody that can.,36,,
495,0.97,3306.002,3308.705,"But it is a fantastic idea and if we are not doing it, we absolutely should be doing it.",36,,
496,0.97,3308.705,3312.776,How many Lpa's?,37,,
497,0.97,3312.776,3313.51,It is in the dozens.,38,,
498,0.97,3313.51,3331.127,"As I understood, the purpose of the list, I think maybe we are thinking of protection of Right-Of-Way's maybe differently or maybe I am just misunderstanding.",39,,
499,0.97,3331.127,3343.773,"Protecting the pipes that are under the street, yes, it affects the street but it is not stopping--it is not preserving the Right-Of-Way for vehicles.",39,,
500,0.97,3343.773,3350.113,"Actually, a lot of times it does.",40,,
501,0.97,3350.113,3352.115,Because the sewer systems are in the middle of the street.,40,,
502,0.97,3352.115,3362.425,"Up the sewer system or drainage is adjacent to the street--when we see movement, it affects the pipes and it actually can close the road.",40,,
503,0.97,3362.425,3364.661,So there really is a direct tie.,40,,
504,0.97,3364.661,3381.111,You might be thinking of the project where the retaining wall to keep some things from hitting the roadway does that is more of like the landslide wil cover the roadway as opposed to move the roadway.,40,,
505,0.97,3381.111,3382.212,So there is that difference.,40,,
506,0.97,3382.212,3387.45,"But I feel like if you have an alley that is halfway down the Úslope, then everything moves, right.",40,,
507,0.97,3387.45,3389.986,So there are different situations.,40,,
508,0.97,3389.986,3406.87,"And is this, again, is this program, are you doing the mitigation projects at these locations, reducing the likelihood of a landslide?",41,,
509,0.97,3406.87,3407.203,Yeah.,42,,
510,0.97,3407.203,3408.671,We have monitoring to see how it is moving.,42,,
511,0.97,3408.671,3416.212,"And then the mitigation projects minimize, or we will try to get, generally speaking, it is getting water away from the slide.",42,,
512,0.97,3416.212,3418.381,So it is not going to continue.,42,,
513,0.97,3418.381,3418.782,Thank you.,43,,
514,0.97,3418.782,3427.423,Or sometimes we have to put in pin piles to stabilize it in order to put in drainage.,44,,
515,0.97,3427.423,3433.196,We just had an emergency project where we did that.,44,,
516,0.97,3433.196,3433.73,My last follow-up.,45,,
517,0.97,3433.73,3449.345,It would be helpful to understand how much is budgeted for this program every year and how well the funding for that meets the need.,45,,
518,0.97,3449.345,3456.553,"As mentioned, I may be wrongly focused more on the Sdot program.",45,,
519,0.97,3456.553,3457.52,And the funds there.,45,,
520,0.97,3457.52,3467.363,"But it appears to be that we should probably be thinking of both when we are talking about investing in landslide mitigation efforts, so thank you.",45,,
521,0.97,3467.363,3467.73,Thank you.,46,,
522,0.97,3467.73,3477.073,"Liz, did you have something to correct manner add to?",47,,
523,0.97,3477.073,3478.942,I was going to talk about where we coordinate.,48,,
524,0.97,3478.942,3484.681,"Councilmember Herbold, I don't know if you remember in 2017 where we had quite a few landslides in West Seattle.",48,,
525,0.97,3484.681,3489.152,One of them was a bridge in California.,48,,
526,0.97,3489.152,3493.623,That one was an area where we were able to coordinate with Spu.,48,,
527,0.97,3493.623,3496.626,There was a landslide and a water main break at the same time.,48,,
528,0.97,3496.626,3499.529,We decided to just work together to install.,48,,
529,0.97,3499.529,3507.503,And often as we are working on the response and the mitigation or coordinate with the other agencies that are part of the landslide program.,48,,
530,0.97,3507.503,3518.348,"To be able to partner, usually impacts Sdot and/or from our perspective, one other Department.",48,,
531,0.97,3518.348,3520.65,It is usually a joint effort.,48,,
532,0.97,3520.65,3529.392,"Often, I have worked with Spu or parks or the other primary groups we work with.",48,,
533,0.97,3529.392,3530.727,We do coordinate when it makes sense.,48,,
534,0.97,3530.727,3541.104,Usually there will be some drainage infrastructure or some other Spu asset that we will need to coordinate work with.,48,,
535,0.97,3541.104,3542.272,Thank you for that.,49,,
536,0.97,3542.272,3549.345,We will touch on landslides one more time toward the end of the Sdot presentation.,49,,
537,0.97,3549.345,3553.616,I think we are ready to go to the Sdot presentation.,49,,
538,0.97,3553.616,3556.786,"And so, director Simpson, we can try your Audio again and see if that works.",49,,
539,0.97,3556.786,3557.52,Thank you.,50,,
540,0.97,3557.52,3563.793,I switched to a different Headset.,50,,
541,0.97,3563.793,3564.661,It works great.,51,,
542,0.97,3564.661,3566.462,Awesome.,52,,
543,0.97,3566.462,3573.002,Good morning again and thank you for inviting us to share with you how we prepare for or respond to winter weather events.,53,,
544,0.97,3573.002,3575.471,We will focus on some of the lessons we have learned.,53,,
545,0.97,3575.471,3578.708,I do want to walk through some of the things we do in advance of an event first.,53,,
546,0.97,3578.708,3598.461,"What I want to highlight here throughout the presentation is how much we rely on and appreciate the support of other city departments, especially Finance and administrative services and Spu was here today and was determined his help during the event.",53,,
547,0.97,3598.461,3601.631,Seattle city light and parks to help keep vehicles running and provide drivers and keep supplies topped off.,53,,
548,0.97,3601.631,3606.703,Mayor Bruce Harrell stopped by the Charles Street facility this morning to thank the folks.,53,,
549,0.97,3606.703,3615.144,And we have been hearing appreciative responses throughout the city as well.,53,,
550,0.97,3615.144,3628.758,"Staying on the slide, we will walk through how we prepare with our equipment and our teams and how we activate in advance of an event and how we respond during the event.",53,,
551,0.97,3628.758,3640.036,"As we have seen, when the immediate event is over, our work is not yet done and we then typically address things like potholes and landslides, both of which are closely tied to ongoing asset management efforts.",53,,
552,0.97,3640.036,3649.979,"And finally, we sure lessons we learned as we look back and prepare for the next event and of course we are happy to answer any questions.",53,,
553,0.97,3649.979,3650.446,Next line.,53,,
554,0.97,3650.446,3652.248,"And at this point, I will hand it over to Darren Morgan.",53,,
555,0.97,3652.248,3657.754,Good morning everyone.,54,,
556,0.97,3657.754,3662.492,"My name is Darren Morgan., division director in the Right- Of-Way maintenance and urban forestry division.",54,,
557,0.97,3662.492,3663.659,Also interim director of parking enforcement division.,54,,
558,0.97,3663.659,3679.842,"As Kristin mentioned, preparation, preparation, preparation is critical to success when it comes to facing the challenges of winter weather.",54,,
559,0.97,3679.842,3688.451,"We are preparing for winter weather events, whether it is snow, ice or excessive precipitation and the risk of landslides.",54,,
560,0.97,3688.451,3695.758,We emphasize public education and outreach throughout the year.,54,,
561,0.97,3695.758,3719.615,"We are also focused on employee training and regional coordination will all of are his partners, including the National weather service who, as early as October is already providing us with some overall climate predictions, whether we might be in a La Niña or an El Niño or a neutral climate prediction for the season, which doesn't necessarily translate to what we can expect each winter.",54,,
562,0.97,3719.615,3728.658,It does give relative indication of whether we might see a more cold and wet season like we experienced the last two years.,54,,
563,0.97,3728.658,3740.837,"With regard to the public education, the cornerstone of our education outreach is really about letting people know that we can't be everywhere at once during an event.",54,,
564,0.97,3740.837,3749.612,And folks do have a responsibility to clear their sidewalks adjacent to their side and properties.,54,,
565,0.97,3749.612,3764.694,"We also want to reiterate how important it is for people to stay home and hit that message if they don't need to get out and about during an event that, that they stay home and if they have to travel, focus on transit.",54,,
566,0.97,3764.694,3765.762,And be prepared in advance.,54,,
567,0.97,3765.762,3773.469,We are talking to folks constantly about reaching out to neighbors and communities to make sure that the neighborhood together is as prepared as possible.,54,,
568,0.97,3773.469,3781.811,Next slide please.,54,,
569,0.97,3781.811,3787.65,"Keeping with preparation, we do a lot of training throughout the year when the sun is shining and the pavement is dry.",55,,
570,0.97,3787.65,3789.986,"We have to Familiarize staff with new and updated equipment, new and updated routes.",55,,
571,0.97,3789.986,3803.166,We double check all of our contracts for Deicer and salt supplies as well as the operational contracts for road clearing operations.,55,,
572,0.97,3803.166,3832.128,"And this is a piece where, as Kristen Simpson mentioned, we are working closely with our partners across the city and Spu and city light and parks and recreation, inviting them to our training sessions to get familiar with our routes and our equipment to make sure we are looking across the city at all staff and skills to support the winter weather response operation.",55,,
573,0.97,3832.128,3839.001,Next slide please.,55,,
574,0.97,3839.001,3844.373,"This is, on the right, you see an overview of what we call the Golden Emerald routes.",56,,
575,0.97,3844.373,3859.589,This is a comprehensive look at the snow and ice treatment routes that we published in advance and we Tweak annually in close coordination with King County Metro in particular.,56,,
576,0.97,3859.589,3862.858,And so the foundation of these routes is transit service.,56,,
577,0.97,3862.858,3869.832,And access to emergency services and hospitals.,56,,
578,0.97,3869.832,3872.468,We optimize staff and resources to clear these.,56,,
579,0.97,3872.468,3885.581,The level of service target for the snow and ice routes is 12 hours to (Indiscernible) the pavement which is two lanes of each direction and the Emerald is one route in each direction.,56,,
580,0.97,3885.581,3903.9,"As I mentioned, we review this very carefully with King County Metro throughout the summer as a look at service level changes or any changes that might have occurred in the Right-Of-Way because of construction or any other changes that might impact the ability for a Snowplow to move through these areas.",56,,
581,0.97,3903.9,3909.071,"There are some steep streets on his route, particularly downtown and access points around the West Seattle bridge.",56,,
582,0.97,3909.071,3923.219,"For the most part, all the critical routes are accessible to snow and ice fighting equipment which is another reason why we focus our attention on these routes.",56,,
583,0.97,3923.219,3923.519,Next slide.,56,,
584,0.97,3923.519,3951.247,"Continuing with the public information we provide as we get closer to events and people start seeing winter snowflakes in the weather Apps, we are putting reinforcing information on our Websites, Blogs and social media streams.",57,,
585,0.97,3951.247,3964.26,We put together an partnership a fantastic Video that helps explain why it is so important for people to do the right thing and what is so important for people to clear sidewalks around the properties.,57,,
586,0.97,3964.26,3977.506,"We do a lot of translation services and have historically distributed 20,000 different brochures in 14 languages, many of which are shown on the slide.",57,,
587,0.97,3977.506,4006.369,"We participate and lead an annual regional winter weather conference where we and by the National weather service, transit partners and other public safety groups and operational apartments and agencies so we can maintain working relationships that we rely on for success during winter weather response and making sure people have an opportunity to meet, even if it is in a virtual environment.",57,,
588,0.97,4006.369,4017.78,And we keep the information in an relationships flowing which is critical to success.,57,,
589,0.97,4017.78,4018.681,Next.,57,,
590,0.97,4018.681,4025.221,"When it comes to activation, we are often standing up our incident management team if we expect we will be operating for a 24/7 period.",57,,
591,0.97,4025.221,4045.107,"In the last event, it was as early as Sunday and Monday, 6-7 days in advance of this last weather event that we had a really solid prediction from the National weather service that the FRASER outflow would have an impact to the region.",57,,
592,0.97,4045.107,4051.647,And so he gave us great lead time to begin planning and looking at staffing levels and Buttoning up all of our equipment.,57,,
593,0.97,4051.647,4059.789,"Much of our equipment that we utilize with snow and ice response is dedicated to other programs, operations and maintenance programs throughout the year.",57,,
594,0.97,4059.789,4068.764,So we began converting our fleet and reaching out to all of our partners and making sure we are all in a joint state of readiness so we can respond.,57,,
595,0.97,4068.764,4078.607,The apartment operations center made up of the incident management team coordinates closely with the city.,57,,
596,0.97,4078.607,4095.958,"Eoc, when active, we are also then turning on features within the Online storm response maps so that the public can see where our equipment has been and also learn information about temporary road closures.",57,,
597,0.97,4095.958,4097.526,A lot of this is happening in Realtime.,57,,
598,0.97,4097.526,4104.5,"So I want to acknowledge in this image, this is the Toc.",57,,
599,0.97,4104.5,4107.103,This image was taken before the pandemic as you can see.,57,,
600,0.97,4107.103,4108.537,There are no masks in this picture.,57,,
601,0.97,4108.537,4130.092,This is an example of all the information in Realtime feed we are using to help refine our information that not only guides our operational response but shares information for the public in Realtime as they plan how to get around the city despite the winter weather.,57,,
602,0.97,4130.092,4135.197,Next slide.,57,,
603,0.97,4135.197,4138.701,This shows both contracted greater services as well as Sdot employees and Seattle city light equipment and employees.,58,,
604,0.97,4138.701,4143.839,Loading up so that will be moving from facility to facility.,58,,
605,0.97,4143.839,4149.478,Or being deployed out into the network.,58,,
606,0.97,4149.478,4154.917,"This last winter weather event, crews worked 24/7, from December 24th until January 5th.",58,,
607,0.97,4154.917,4165.427,Almost two solid weeks straight right in the middle of the holiday period and crossed over into a change in administration.,58,,
608,0.97,4165.427,4181.911,"Overall, as I mentioned to Mayor Bruce Harrell this morning when we were in the FAS facility, the Sdot fleet alone we were able to track, so doesn't include all city fleet but what we were able to track, demonstrated 40,000 miles driven, whether that is patrolling, treating or treating and plowing.",58,,
609,0.97,4181.911,4187.182,So pretty significant level of effort measured in miles.,58,,
610,0.97,4187.182,4212.775,"As I mentioned earlier, the level of service is what pavement--(Indiscrnible) during a break in the storm which we were able to achieve mostly but it was a challenging event with multiple Substation events as well as extreme cold which then translated into thawing and Re- freezing at night.",58,,
611,0.97,4212.775,4219.248,So definitely a challenging few weeks.,58,,
612,0.97,4219.248,4221.85,And it is only February 1ST so we are keeping our eye on the forecast.,58,,
613,0.97,4221.85,4223.786,Not out of the woods yet.,58,,
614,0.97,4223.786,4224.353,Next slide.,58,,
615,0.97,4224.353,4231.66,"As I mentioned before, we rely on our partners.",58,,
616,0.97,4231.66,4244.039,We mentioned earlier we had Seattle city light and pedestrian clearing support and driver support.,58,,
617,0.97,4244.039,4251.113,As speedy as if it has a partner in communicating with us working with us on Street closures and we work closely with Seattle fire and the emergency response operations.,58,,
618,0.97,4251.113,4259.888,They let us know where they need assistance and the work closely with them to provide access to the best degree that we can.,58,,
619,0.97,4259.888,4268.097,"And then King County Metro, we have excellent daily if not more frequent coordination and communication.",58,,
620,0.97,4268.097,4285.447,Sound transit and Washington State Department of Transportation is another critical partner in coordinating treatment as well as the primary administrator of the contract that governs the use of the salt throughout the region.,58,,
621,0.97,4285.447,4285.748,Next slide.,58,,
622,0.97,4285.748,4289.218,I want to talk about our work in the mobility branch with an operations.,59,,
623,0.97,4289.218,4302.498,"There is a tremendous amount of work that is done on the day shift to mitigate impact to facilities, ramps and Overpasses.",59,,
624,0.97,4302.498,4303.365,Notice 3300 curb ramps.,59,,
625,0.97,4303.365,4304.166,30-45 people each day.,59,,
626,0.97,4304.166,4310.873,Some of those curb ramps will need to be cleared multiple times during an event.,59,,
627,0.97,4310.873,4323.218,So that is related to the plowing operations that is constantly having to move material to the side of the road which causes the need for us to clear those ramps repeatedly throughout an event.,59,,
628,0.97,4323.218,4337.633,"We also work closely with public health facilities in the Seattle school district at different points during winter weather response and as resources allow, we do what we can to facilitate school openings and support for access.",59,,
629,0.97,4337.633,4355.784,"We also, during our Dayshift and the mobility group, we are out with Street inspectors and communicating with folks and reminding them in Realtime based on conditions in Realtime the responsibility to clear the sidewalk around the business.",59,,
630,0.97,4355.784,4357.553,"In most cases, we are talking directly with folks.",59,,
631,0.97,4357.553,4365.394,"In many cases, we are knocking on doors and leaving literature to reinforce Messaging.",59,,
632,0.97,4365.394,4373.102,This is also response operation tracked under the response map as well.,59,,
633,0.97,4373.102,4374.336,Next slide.,59,,
634,0.97,4374.336,4376.939,I'm going to talk about some of the work we did around bike lanes.,59,,
635,0.97,4376.939,4384.58,This is not an exhaustive list but this is an example of some of the equipment and resources and how we manage moving snow out of protective bike lanes.,59,,
636,0.97,4384.58,4394.156,"This year, we had a bit of a challenge with supply chain issues for some of the equipment we don't own but we often rent to expand the fleet.",59,,
637,0.97,4394.156,4406.101,"We were able to, toward the tail end of the event, get our hands on 5-7 of these Skid steers that you see here.",59,,
638,0.97,4406.101,4414.309,And there is quite a list of protective bike lanes where we were able to get into and facilitate the reopening as well.,59,,
639,0.97,4414.309,4422.684,"And I think at this point, maybe their questions but we are getting ready to talk about some of the pavement impact and pothole response that we Transitioned to as part of the winter weather recovery.",59,,
640,0.97,4422.684,4427.222,And that is Gerard green.,59,,
641,0.97,4427.222,4428.123,"Thank you, Darren.",60,,
642,0.97,4428.123,4432.861,Thank you for recognizing the workers as well as the coordination with other departments.,60,,
643,0.97,4432.861,4440.736,I know we are eager to hear about the pavement and pothole issues as well.,60,,
644,0.97,4440.736,4447.91,"So colleagues, if there are no questions at this point, we can keep going.",60,,
645,0.97,4447.91,4448.41,Councilmember Morales.,60,,
646,0.97,4448.41,4449.745,I actually have several questions.,61,,
647,0.97,4449.745,4451.947,But I'm happy to hold them until the end of the presentation.,61,,
648,0.97,4451.947,4452.281,That is fine.,61,,
649,0.97,4452.281,4456.852,Thank you.,62,,
650,0.97,4456.852,4457.453,Councilmember Strauss.,63,,
651,0.97,4457.453,4463.425,"Thank you, chair.",64,,
652,0.97,4463.425,4463.926,No questions.,64,,
653,0.97,4463.926,4474.303,I want to say how astonished and impressed I am by the ability of to get the city back and moving.,64,,
654,0.97,4474.303,4475.871,Anything from trees to the road and now snow.,64,,
655,0.97,4475.871,4477.272,Thank you for doing so much for our city.,64,,
656,0.97,4477.272,4483.846,I appreciate that.,65,,
657,0.97,4483.846,4499.761,But I have to say that there is a massive amount of effort by a tremendous number of dedicated employees and frontline staff that bring the attitude and the enthusiasm and the love for the job that make it all possible.,65,,
658,0.97,4499.761,4500.128,But thank you.,65,,
659,0.97,4500.128,4500.696,Okay.,66,,
660,0.97,4500.696,4511.24,Let's go to the next section.,66,,
661,0.97,4511.54,4512.908,Pavement and potholes.,66,,
662,0.97,4512.908,4514.443,Good morning everyone.,67,,
663,0.97,4514.443,4515.41,My name is Gerard green.,67,,
664,0.97,4515.41,4523.051,I'm the pavement signs and markings and Right-Of-Way crew construction director at Sdot.,67,,
665,0.97,4523.051,4526.288,"This slide, I will talk a little bit about the typical pothole response.",67,,
666,0.97,4526.288,4529.224,Potholes are called in and they come in in a number of ways.,67,,
667,0.97,4529.224,4530.092,"Typically, find it fix it.",67,,
668,0.97,4530.092,4533.896,That is the App.,67,,
669,0.97,4533.896,4536.632,"Or customer care, they call 684- roads.",67,,
670,0.97,4536.632,4538.634,They call in a pothole.,67,,
671,0.97,4538.634,4546.608,"When that happens, a work order is created and then we will dispatch a crew to go out and evaluate to see if it is in fact a pothole.",67,,
672,0.97,4546.608,4552.314,Sometimes the public will call in a pothole and it could be a utility cut.,67,,
673,0.97,4552.314,4558.687,"In that case, we work with our Street use partner to make sure we work with contractors to address the utility.",67,,
674,0.97,4558.687,4564.126,"If the temporary patch has failed, we will have them address that.",67,,
675,0.97,4564.126,4566.428,"If we do go on, and it could also be a void.",67,,
676,0.97,4566.428,4586.248,"In the case of a void, we work with our Spu partners to do tests and make sure there are no underlying issues with pipes and stuff before we actually Backfill and then ultimately do the temporary repair and schedule for a permanent repair.",67,,
677,0.97,4586.248,4587.549,So that is typically how that flows.,67,,
678,0.97,4587.549,4596.625,"Another thing that can happen when we go out to do the more immediate (Indiscernible) for the public, is there will be an assessment.",67,,
679,0.97,4596.625,4597.893,Sometimes we send pavement engineer out.,67,,
680,0.97,4597.893,4604.066,They will determine if the road has the--road has degraded to a point where a pothole is not the solution.,67,,
681,0.97,4604.066,4610.639,"In those cases, we will put together a project and we have to schedule for traffic control.",67,,
682,0.97,4610.639,4612.04,Sometimes coordination with Metro and others.,67,,
683,0.97,4612.04,4613.942,If it is near a school.,67,,
684,0.97,4613.942,4620.515,That would be a more long-term repair.,67,,
685,0.97,4620.515,4627.889,Similar to what you would see on a regular Sdot paving project.,67,,
686,0.97,4627.889,4637.899,Next slide . This slide talks a little bit about some data and the recent post winter storm response.,67,,
687,0.97,4637.899,4647.309,This first figure says that crews filled nearly 3500 potholes in the month of January.,67,,
688,0.97,4647.309,4662.257,"Since his presentation has been sent to counsel, we ran another report and our data analyst just notified us today that crews actually filled 4700, a little over 4700 potholes in the month of January.",67,,
689,0.97,4662.257,4666.895,And so that is a huge number of potholes compared to our normal pothole response.,67,,
690,0.97,4666.895,4676.805,"To accomplish this, we added up to 70-75 staff . and the staff came from our paving work groups that are normally out there paving.",67,,
691,0.97,4676.805,4682.277,The larger paving programs.,67,,
692,0.97,4682.277,4683.278,1-3 blocks long usually.,67,,
693,0.97,4683.278,4691.553,We also deployed a little over 11 additional paving trucks to assist the four pothole trucks that repair potholes Year- round.,67,,
694,0.97,4691.553,4700.062,We did focus on gold and Emerald routes because those are the same arterial routes that keep traffic and freight moving through the city.,67,,
695,0.97,4700.062,4709.204,And we also addressed a find it fix it request on Non- Arterials.,67,,
696,0.97,4709.204,4718.914,"And in this case, because of the number of potholes, we did not--we moved away from the ordinary First-Come, First-Served which is what we typically do with find it fix it.",67,,
697,0.97,4718.914,4728.356,That is tied with the last few Maier administrations metric to kind of turn those pothole requests around in three business days.,67,,
698,0.97,4728.356,4737.432,"We recently, I think last month, met with the Mayor's team and we kind of talked about that and some of the Trade-Offs with that.",67,,
699,0.97,4737.432,4741.336,Some of the Trade-Offs are when you have the three day turnaround.,67,,
700,0.97,4741.336,4758.253,"That is what your focuses, to turn those around and get out there and get those fixed quickly . But when we are not following that, it can provide a more equitable distribution of our services, meaning we are not going off the metric.",67,,
701,0.97,4758.253,4763.825,"It allows us to run those core doors, those golden Emerald routes and then we can triage based on need and severity as well.",67,,
702,0.97,4763.825,4764.96,There are some Trade-Offs.,67,,
703,0.97,4764.96,4774.136,And we have a follow-up meeting with the Mayor's team to talk about that a little more.,67,,
704,0.97,4774.136,4783.979,"To the right, this line graph shows the spike in potholes in January because of some of the conditions that Darren mentioned earlier.",67,,
705,0.97,4783.979,4795.157,And I think now we will transition to landslides with with Sheldon.,67,,
706,0.97,4795.157,4807.068,I first one to circle back to Councilmember Morales and her questions dealing with these core Sdot functions during the storms and then I might have a question about potholes.,68,,
707,0.97,4807.068,4807.702,"Councilmember Morales, placed.",68,,
708,0.97,4807.702,4808.203,Good morning.,69,,
709,0.97,4808.203,4812.874,Thank you so much everybody.,69,,
710,0.97,4812.874,4816.178,You will not be surprised to know that I'm interested in hearing about pedestrian safety.,69,,
711,0.97,4816.178,4822.484,I have some questions about sidewalk Shoveling and responsibility.,69,,
712,0.97,4822.484,4837.199,"I do think it is important to acknowledge first that in South Seattle, and I know in North Seattle too, there are a lot of streets that just don't even have sidewalks.",69,,
713,0.97,4837.199,4842.27,So the question about who is responsible is sort of moot there.,69,,
714,0.97,4842.27,4858.987,"But it does bring into relief the peril that people are in, if they are really stuck at home because the city doesn't plow the streets and there is no sidewalk for them to plow so they can try to get around the neighborhood.",69,,
715,0.97,4858.987,4863.925,So I guess my first question is just kind of an enforcement question.,69,,
716,0.97,4863.925,4875.403,We do some kind of public education campaign.,69,,
717,0.97,4875.403,4892.921,"If apartment managers or small businesses or individual households are having a hard time, what is the enforcement mechanism for not Shoveling a sidewalk.",69,,
718,0.97,4892.921,4894.456,"If Liz is on the line, can you jump in?",70,,
719,0.97,4894.456,4895.857,I can.,71,,
720,0.97,4895.857,4905.267,"The enforcement mechanism really is through, we start with warnings and communication.",71,,
721,0.97,4905.267,4916.711,And then title 15 has a provision for citations that we could issue if there are ongoing needs to clear the snow on sidewalks.,71,,
722,0.97,4916.711,4923.985,"We have not done that, I don't think at all, to my knowledge.",71,,
723,0.97,4923.985,4930.058,And we prefer to really work toward compliance through communication and conversations with property owners.,71,,
724,0.97,4930.058,4935.764,"And often times, we will do a first round of Notifications.",71,,
725,0.97,4935.764,4938.6,So with door hangers and make sure we knock on doors on what people know.,71,,
726,0.97,4938.6,4950.145,"By the time--that we make our first round through the high priority areas that we are getting to medication out to, the event is over.",71,,
727,0.97,4950.145,4961.289,And we haven't had a situation where we have gone through the first round of communication and then looked toward more significant enforcement later.,71,,
728,0.97,4961.289,4978.873,"I guess I would say, I'm really interested in understanding how we might shift some of our priorities and these responses so that we are really thinking about pedestrian safety and pedestrian access.",72,,
729,0.97,4978.873,4994.789,I have a lot of folks in my part of town and I know folks are all over town who are Wheelchair-Bound or have vision Impairments who simply do not drive and still need to be able to get around the city when these events are happening.,72,,
730,0.97,4994.789,4999.728,And so I'm interested to know if we have any equipment that is suitable for plowing sidewalks.,72,,
731,0.97,4999.728,5011.072,"I'm not necessarily interested in penalizing people, because these are in frequent events.",72,,
732,0.97,5011.072,5016.678,"Every time something happens, there is a run on salt and a run on shovels and Toboggans.",72,,
733,0.97,5016.678,5029.557,And so I understand that people are not necessarily prepared as we would hope they are for these events.,72,,
734,0.97,5029.557,5036.264,"And it is very dangerous for people who are essential workers and still need to get to school or work, not to be able to use the sidewalk.",72,,
735,0.97,5036.264,5053.815,"I saw somebody--I think this was last winter, pushing someone in a wheelchair in the middle of the road because the sidewalk wasn't cleared and the snow plow had come through and all the snow was at the curb.",72,,
736,0.97,5053.815,5060.755,And that was the only way for them to get on the street.,72,,
737,0.97,5060.755,5068.897,And so I think--I understand these winter events are infrequent.,72,,
738,0.97,5068.897,5076.171,I understand there are resource questions on how we can invest in the kind of equipment that would allow us to do a better job.,72,,
739,0.97,5076.171,5093.955,"But I think it is critical to have a better understanding of what that looks like and start planning for this because as climate change leads us to more were--more severe weather, we will have to address this in a different way.",72,,
740,0.97,5093.955,5098.193,So that was my enforcement question.,72,,
741,0.97,5098.193,5118.213,"And then I guess I would like to just say that when I'm thinking about our kids getting stuck at home for a week or two because they can't walk down the sidewalk, I sort of do a risk assessment.",72,,
742,0.97,5118.213,5139.734,I think it would be safer to try to walk to school if the sidewalks were clear than for me to try and drive my kids to school up a slick icy road and there is a hill on either side of me.,72,,
743,0.97,5139.734,5153.014,"So the fear that I have for elderly folks or people with mobility Impairments as if they do try to navigate the sidewalk and there is a car driving up the hill, they could get taken out easily.",72,,
744,0.97,5153.014,5161.289,We have all seen the Video of what happens when people are trying to drive in Seattle because we simply aren't--our topography just makes it dangerous.,72,,
745,0.97,5161.289,5192.086,"And so all that to say, I'm interested in trying to understand what it would take for us to shift our priorities a little bit and make sure we are focusing on making sure kids can get to school and that commercial corridors are clear so neighbors can get to essential services without having to rely on getting in a car and driving down potentially really dangerous roads.",72,,
746,0.97,5192.086,5192.82,Thank you.,73,,
747,0.97,5192.82,5198.359,I hear what you are saying and I agree that pedestrians need to be a priority in these responses.,73,,
748,0.97,5198.359,5207.068,"Instead of trying to answer off the top of our heads today, I would like to offer doing some research and look into your questions about equipment and resources and Prioritization.",73,,
749,0.97,5207.068,5211.239,And then provide that.,73,,
750,0.97,5211.239,5212.34,That would be great.,74,,
751,0.97,5212.34,5220.181,And I'm happy to be working with you.,74,,
752,0.97,5220.181,5232.994,Chair Pedersen would love for this to be an ongoing conversation so we can try to be better prepared next winter.,74,,
753,0.97,5232.994,5233.394,Thank you.,75,,
754,0.97,5233.394,5233.761,Sounds great.,75,,
755,0.97,5233.761,5234.362,Councilmember Herbold.,76,,
756,0.97,5234.362,5234.729,Thanks.,77,,
757,0.97,5234.729,5246.741,I do feel like we really do make an effort to be more prepared after having these events.,77,,
758,0.97,5246.741,5259.287,I feel like sometimes we lose the historical memory and knowledge of what we were doing it for.,77,,
759,0.97,5259.287,5275.57,"Back in 2019, the council passed a resolution that--and I believe it was handled in a way that was intended to be an advance of winter storms.",77,,
760,0.97,5275.57,5294.856,"One of the things you asked for, and received, we asked for Sdot to lead on a public education forum educating residents and property owners about the possibilities for snow and ice removal after the 2019 resolution.",77,,
761,0.97,5294.856,5295.757,"In 2020, we saw that.",77,,
762,0.97,5295.757,5301.996,And we saw a program in the past year as well.,77,,
763,0.97,5301.996,5302.864,And really shaped that.,77,,
764,0.97,5302.864,5317.111,One of the things we asked for was a report back on how to emphasize the clearing of sidewalks by commercial property owners with the goal of doing so within 12 hours of an event.,77,,
765,0.97,5317.111,5330.258,And we invited directors articulated the policies if appropriate and any not legislative proposals necessary to strengthen the enforcement of those expectations.,77,,
766,0.97,5330.258,5334.228,I do believe we got that report.,77,,
767,0.97,5334.228,5346.841,I was pulling it up to see what actions were recommended and whether we not--whether or not we fulfill those actions.,77,,
768,0.97,5346.841,5352.447,We did get a report in 2020.,77,,
769,0.97,5352.447,5373.434,"And as we are talking and trying to compare what Sdot recommended--and if there is anyone with us today who has instant recollection of that, maybe you could tell us.",77,,
770,0.97,5375.703,5376.704,I do not.,78,,
771,0.97,5376.704,5377.171,Anybody on the team?,78,,
772,0.97,5377.171,5384.645,It might be one we need to get back to on.,79,,
773,0.97,5384.645,5401.729,"Like Councilmember Morales said, our interest in passing that resolution was both the public notice of the expectations and also the expectations for more robust enforcement.",80,,
774,0.97,5401.729,5408.236,And that is the piece that I think I would like to know whether or not.,80,,
775,0.97,5408.236,5415.076,If we made recommendations we didn't act on or whether or not the recommendations did not actually make any suggestions in that area.,80,,
776,0.97,5415.076,5425.52,It looks like Covid-19 is open from our central staff might have information.,81,,
777,0.97,5425.52,5432.26,I'm not sure I can add too much without a little time to go back and look through the reports.,82,,
778,0.97,5432.26,5442.57,My recollection is that a lot of the focus was on the commercial district areas where there are property owners and businesses and others where it is easier to work with.,82,,
779,0.97,5442.57,5451.646,A lot of what I'm hearing today is kind of highlighting that we really do rely on residents to help deal in the residential neighborhoods.,82,,
780,0.97,5451.646,5461.222,"It is great to get the commercial districts cleared but if you have to walk to get there, you will get there through residential streets.",82,,
781,0.97,5461.222,5474.235,"One thing I notice on my Street is that, if residents are unable to clear it wouldn't snow first happens, by the next day, it is a sheet of ice.",82,,
782,0.97,5474.235,5485.246,"And the difficulty it is for some of my neighbors to deal with that, whether we have the equipment or the manpower, I think that is really kind of the big issue.",82,,
783,0.97,5485.246,5490.251,We have been able to focus our resources in the commercial district where we can take limited resources and focus there.,82,,
784,0.97,5490.251,5493.721,But the residential neighborhoods a much bigger area.,82,,
785,0.97,5493.721,5502.396,So I think there is that resource concern still working.,82,,
786,0.97,5502.396,5508.336,And a lot of what we are talking about still points back to that problem.,82,,
787,0.97,5508.336,5512.64,"Thank you, Calvin.",83,,
788,0.97,5512.64,5527.555,"If we could get you and Sdot to work together is to look at that resolution to see what has been done and what hasn't been done and maybe make some recommendations for follow-up and then you could circulate that to the committee members, that would be helpful.",83,,
789,0.97,5527.555,5532.093,We will definitely work together on that.,84,,
790,0.97,5532.093,5543.738,"Councilmember Herbold, did you have any other questions or we will go to Councilmember Strauss.",85,,
791,0.97,5543.738,5546.807,"Thank you, chair.",86,,
792,0.97,5546.807,5549.01,And thank you to Sdot.,86,,
793,0.97,5549.01,5557.084,I want to say that I know this storm in particular created more potholes than previous because of freezing temperatures.,86,,
794,0.97,5557.084,5558.252,I will just highlight and thank you.,86,,
795,0.97,5558.252,5567.762,There was a puddle in my district that was sending traffic into an oncoming Lane on a blind turn.,86,,
796,0.97,5567.762,5589.016,"And while your team was not able to Prioritize the filling of the puddle immediately because you were out dealing with landslides, you were able to create a flag and have signs to say go around the pothole on the right-hand side rather than going into oncoming traffic and it was able to resolve the situation until you are able to fill the pothole.",86,,
797,0.97,5589.016,5590.351,I want to thank you for that.,86,,
798,0.97,5590.351,5594.355,"And also lose, the same concerns that Councilmember Morales has and I don't know if this is your responsibility.",86,,
799,0.97,5594.355,5613.04,But there is an apartment in the district that is the only sidewalk in between a retirement facility and the rest of the sidewalk (Indiscernible) and that sidewalk doesn't get shoveled and it creates a very dangerous situation for seniors.,86,,
800,0.97,5613.04,5615.676,"Any information you would like to follow up on that, please include me.",86,,
801,0.97,5615.676,5618.012,Thank you for your work during the storm.,86,,
802,0.97,5618.012,5624.051,Thank you for that acknowledgment and that information.,87,,
803,0.97,5624.051,5629.123,This is the point where we intend to transition to talk about our role in the landslide issues.,87,,
804,0.97,5629.123,5631.659,"And was there are any other questions on potholes, we will do that.",87,,
805,0.97,5631.659,5636.297,I do have a question on potholes.,88,,
806,0.97,5636.297,5646.374,"Gerard, you had mentioned normally the standard that Sdot applies to fill the pothole within three business days of receiving it.",88,,
807,0.97,5646.374,5658.886,"However, when there is a spike in the number of requests, there might be a different way of sorting the cues so that it is more equitable distribution.",88,,
808,0.97,5658.886,5670.765,"And so, is there--are you still able to meet the three business days?",88,,
809,0.97,5670.765,5671.766,Or is that something that would slide?,88,,
810,0.97,5671.766,5678.506,That would slide when we have a spike like we recently got hit with.,89,,
811,0.97,5678.506,5679.34,Just the sheer number.,89,,
812,0.97,5679.34,5682.243,Mainly our focus to public safety.,89,,
813,0.97,5682.243,5691.018,"So from that response metric, it is more like, we have to get out and make sure the largest and most dangerous potholes are actually addressed.",89,,
814,0.97,5691.018,5699.026,So we are not allowed during that period--we would be able to meet the three days.,89,,
815,0.97,5699.026,5704.498,So we basically ask for forgiveness for the period like we are still in.,89,,
816,0.97,5704.498,5705.466,We are still in that period.,89,,
817,0.97,5705.466,5709.303,"But as you can see, 3500-4700 potholes last month.",89,,
818,0.97,5709.303,5719.947,"We think within the last week or week and a half, we would be able to resort back to our normal pothole and did a great job filling a lot of potholes.",89,,
819,0.97,5719.947,5727.621,And using that approach will be mobilized into districts.,89,,
820,0.97,5727.621,5729.323,"In this case, we divide the city into seven districts.",89,,
821,0.97,5729.323,5739.133,"In addition to those Ranger trucks, we add up to 70 staff with additional trucks out there filling potholes and running Arterials in each district.",89,,
822,0.97,5739.133,5741.502,So that really helps us to be more efficient when we can do that.,89,,
823,0.97,5741.502,5749.743,And we will be talking about this more with the Mayor's team on some of the Trade-Offs when we have to meet that three day turnaround.,89,,
824,0.97,5749.743,5750.311,Thank you.,90,,
825,0.97,5750.311,5762.089,That is a really helpful explanation about how you leveraged other crews as well to help with the spike in potholes.,90,,
826,0.97,5762.089,5767.294,"And for us, we need to meet with the Mayor's office on this, keep us in mind in terms of our monitoring role.",90,,
827,0.97,5767.294,5781.909,"For us, it is easy to come it is easier to look at something like a three business day turnaround when you switch to a different mode of responding which may make sense for the reasons you mentioned.",90,,
828,0.97,5781.909,5786.58,"Safety, equity, et cetera.",90,,
829,0.97,5786.58,5798.159,We would need to know what those Metrics are so we all hold ourselves accountable for what the results are and the response times are when you shift to that new type of situation and what those Metrics would be.,90,,
830,0.97,5798.159,5801.862,So we would like to know what those would be.,90,,
831,0.97,5801.862,5806.634,"But it is good to know that in a couple of weeks, you will get back to the three business days.",90,,
832,0.97,5806.634,5812.873,That is helpful for us to manage expectations as we get Inbound requests from constituents.,90,,
833,0.97,5812.873,5828.155,But we know to send them off to 684-Roads or the find it Fix-It App or the service Bureau as well.,90,,
834,0.97,5828.155,5828.956,Thank you very much.,90,,
835,0.97,5828.956,5829.657,Definitely will do.,91,,
836,0.97,5829.657,5829.99,Thank you.,91,,
837,0.97,5829.99,5843.137,"Before we switch to landslides, I would point out that the two does the Proactive work we are doing on the Golden Emerald routes does not exclude--there is overlap between the same potholes that folks may be calling in.",92,,
838,0.97,5843.137,5843.504,As.,92,,
839,0.97,5843.504,5848.542,"Out there Blitzing to these priority routes, we are also hitting a lot of the things folks have either called and/or would have called in.",92,,
840,0.97,5848.542,5853.013,So there is some overlap there.,92,,
841,0.97,5853.013,5853.414,Thank you.,93,,
842,0.97,5853.414,5861.488,"Liz, I believe it is time to transition to a little bit on landslides.",94,,
843,0.97,5861.488,5862.323,Back to landslides.,95,,
844,0.97,5862.323,5865.693,I wanted to talk a little bit about the history of the landslide program.,95,,
845,0.97,5865.693,5871.298,Tonya mentioned it a little bit.,95,,
846,0.97,5871.298,5873.434,"It started in 1996, 1997.",95,,
847,0.97,5873.434,5880.441,There were similar conditions to what we experienced in December and January of this year but much more extreme.,95,,
848,0.97,5880.441,5886.046,I think it was two weeks of snow that then turned to a significant rainfall.,95,,
849,0.97,5886.046,5895.723,"Out of that, there were more than 300 landslides that happened, mostly in 97.",95,,
850,0.97,5895.723,5895.956,"96, 97.",95,,
851,0.97,5895.956,5911.672,"$300 million worth of lawsuits out of that, counsel at the time directed the city to create a citywide landslide team which is what Tonya was speaking about earlier.",95,,
852,0.97,5911.672,5914.041,And so it was created to improve coordination of all of the departments.,95,,
853,0.97,5914.041,5918.879,Primarily those that respond to landslide events.,95,,
854,0.97,5918.879,5930.491,"And it also helped us consolidate landslide information and we now put all of our responses to landslides, as Tony mentioned, into the web Eoc program.",95,,
855,0.97,5930.491,5950.044,"So as we are looking at developing the Prioritization data . E can all draw on that as Tonya mentioned, Spu leads a Coronation meeting that makes sure we all have contact information and are able to know the rules and response abilities when we are moving into landslide season.",95,,
856,0.97,5950.044,5959.653,And then really work together to communicate closely during periods of weather.,95,,
857,0.97,5959.653,5967.695,It is typical that we will have a couple of days of really extreme or almost extreme events with landslides.,95,,
858,0.97,5967.695,5985.012,So the landslide teams and departments are extremely busy for those periods when they are dealing with landslides and often will be in constant medication to make sure that we have and delegate responsibility to all of the events that are happening . and the Sdot also created the landslide mitigation Prioritization list.,95,,
859,0.97,5985.012,5995.923,And that was created and finished up in 2000 and we are still working through the Prioritization's.,95,,
860,0.97,5995.923,5996.857,Next slide.,95,,
861,0.97,5996.857,6003.23,"For January of 2022, there were about a dozen landslides that occurred across the city.",96,,
862,0.97,6003.23,6006.367,Tonya had it far less but she was looking at a more constrained time.,96,,
863,0.97,6006.367,6007.634,This is through most of January.,96,,
864,0.97,6007.634,6015.342,And Sdot specifically responded to eight locations that impacted public Right-Of-Way.,96,,
865,0.97,6015.342,6025.386,"Again, priority is always on public safety, arterial streets and impact to pedestrian traffic.",96,,
866,0.97,6025.386,6025.719,Next slide.,96,,
867,0.97,6025.719,6035.729,The biggest landslide that Sdot responded to during this period was the Highland parkway Southwest.,97,,
868,0.97,6035.729,6042.736,This as you know is getting into the West Seattle bridge Detour.,97,,
869,0.97,6042.736,6044.505,There were two landslides that occurred January 7th and January 11th.,97,,
870,0.97,6044.505,6054.114,"And it was a coordination between Spu, city light parks and SPD all working together to clear and reopen the streets.",97,,
871,0.97,6054.114,6073.4,What we did near term is installed some concrete boxes to support the land and did some initial control on the hillside and are looking to come back in the spring and hopefully when there is a little more of a clear period to do more vegetation work.,97,,
872,0.97,6073.4,6077.104,So that is looking at Highland park.,97,,
873,0.97,6077.104,6080.34,And I think that is the end of my slides.,97,,
874,0.97,6080.34,6080.741,Kristen Simpson.,97,,
875,0.97,6080.741,6081.408,"Thank you, Liz.",98,,
876,0.97,6081.408,6085.379,Just a couple slides to go.,98,,
877,0.97,6085.379,6095.856,"As much as we do during a snow or winter weather event, we want to keep the traveling public and formed during Follow- up actions as well, including through the Twitter accounts you see here.",98,,
878,0.97,6095.856,6097.524,Especially for something involving quickly.,98,,
879,0.97,6097.524,6103.397,We have got a lot of good feedback on how we kept folks informed on the Highland parkway response.,98,,
880,0.97,6103.397,6108.735,And then we always get good feedback as we are repairing potholes.,98,,
881,0.97,6108.735,6109.269,Next slide please.,98,,
882,0.97,6109.269,6118.645,"In terms of lessons learned and long-term follow-up, when we talk about potholes, we don't want to just talk about fixing them.",98,,
883,0.97,6118.645,6122.883,We want to talk about the importance of maintaining our streets to reduce the number of potholes that form in the first place.,98,,
884,0.97,6122.883,6130.257,We have been able to do a lot of good paving work through the love Eastern company of Seattle.,98,,
885,0.97,6130.257,6141.835,"If you are out and about, it is start to see the contrast between a freshly paved Street and how few potholes you will see there versus an older Street who has had a lot of the freeze thaw possible action.",98,,
886,0.97,6141.835,6147.941,The members also mentioned the landslide mitigation projects.,98,,
887,0.97,6147.941,6151.578,"Some of the lessons we have learned, I think we have heard from you here as well.",98,,
888,0.97,6151.578,6155.816,Folks seem to have a good understanding of the sidewalk clearing message.,98,,
889,0.97,6155.816,6162.99,But there are some barriers to that being fully successful.,98,,
890,0.97,6162.99,6167.06,We need to continue providing information to people about what they can expecting terms of what streets are plowed.,98,,
891,0.97,6167.06,6178.238,We want to keep sharing public information about other city services as well and amplifying information that partners are providing.,98,,
892,0.97,6178.238,6189.116,And we do want to continue the very successful partnership in working with other departments to have access to drivers and equipment when we have to do the extended responses.,98,,
893,0.97,6189.116,6206.867,"I think that is a good transition to our last slide where again, we wanted to highlight both our own staff working so hard over the holidays and through the pandemic and to the support we received from other departments as well.",98,,
894,0.97,6206.867,6208.435,So that is the end of our slides.,98,,
895,0.97,6208.435,6212.706,Happy to answer any questions that have come up so far.,98,,
896,0.97,6212.706,6215.509,Thank you very much.,99,,
897,0.97,6215.509,6226.72,"Thank you to Sdot and your team here today as well as the workers in the field, as well as Seattle public utilities.",99,,
898,0.97,6226.72,6227.354,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",99,,
899,0.97,6227.354,6230.324,Thank you.,100,,
900,0.97,6230.324,6252.479,"I do want to again thank, as I thanked Spu for being so active in South Park during the flooding that folks experienced, I want to thank Sdot for, in very difficult conditions, being out and serving the public.",100,,
901,0.97,6252.479,6264.224,"Understaffed, and many folks also having their own personal public health issues with Covid- 19 infections and Whatnot.",100,,
902,0.97,6264.224,6268.695,And putting a much greater burden on folks who are left to do the work.,100,,
903,0.97,6268.695,6269.896,So really appreciative of that.,100,,
904,0.97,6269.896,6271.898,I do have a couple of other questions about the landslide assessment.,100,,
905,0.97,6271.898,6279.94,I thought I heard the report that the list was done.,100,,
906,0.97,6279.94,6282.109,I would like to know a little bit more about what that means.,100,,
907,0.97,6282.109,6294.421,"My recollection from reading my notes, not from memory, but these are notes from a few years ago, I think 2017.",100,,
908,0.97,6294.421,6312.506,There was the landslide mitigation Prioritization list and Sdot in 2000 did a risk of the locations on the list using eight factors to determine the priority of 73 known potential landslide locations.,100,,
909,0.97,6312.506,6320.147,"Of the 7, they made 24 of them High-Priority locations.",100,,
910,0.97,6320.147,6332.392,"In 2017, we found out that only seven of the 24 High-Priority locations had had Proactive mitigation work done.",100,,
911,0.97,6332.392,6348.809,"And so am I hearing you say that all 24--because we did definitely approve additional funds into one thing--in 2017, the additional 1.37 million for advanced landslide mitigation.",100,,
912,0.97,6348.809,6353.38,"And I know in the subsequent year, there were more funds than what had previously been allocated.",100,,
913,0.97,6353.38,6359.119,Hopefully we have been able to keep up with the cost of addressing these 24 locations.,100,,
914,0.97,6359.119,6364.324,If you can just confirm for me that I did hear you correctly.,100,,
915,0.97,6364.324,6371.264,That all 24 of the high- priority locations have had Proactive work done done.,100,,
916,0.97,6371.264,6375.268,"Councilmember Herbold, I wish that was the case.",101,,
917,0.97,6375.268,6378.405,What I meant was that list itself was developed.,101,,
918,0.97,6378.405,6382.042,We have not made that much progress on the list.,101,,
919,0.97,6382.042,6389.416,"So we have completed, since that time, I believe there has been one more project Ompleted, the Rayner Avenue South project from the original High-Priority list.",101,,
920,0.97,6389.416,6405.565,"If you can (Indiscernible) that because counsel said, we provided funding I thought for another five mitigation projects.",102,,
921,0.97,6405.565,6411.204,So I would love if you could get back to us on that.,102,,
922,0.97,6411.204,6425.318,"The--on slide 17, you noted that the--February landslide response, that they were eight landslides Impacting in the Right-Of-Way.",102,,
923,0.97,6425.318,6442.402,"I'm wondering, is part of our efforts to Proactively mitigate the likelihood of a landslide before they occur, to consider tracking bills locations where issues have occurred?",102,,
924,0.97,6442.402,6445.772,It is my understanding that that is sort of the point of the list.,102,,
925,0.97,6445.772,6460.32,"Again, to use this criteria to identify those locations where it is likely that something is going to recur.",102,,
926,0.97,6460.32,6465.025,And my last question is related to Highland Parkway.,102,,
927,0.97,6465.025,6478.271,I recognize that the location of the landslide this year was actually--actually it was a different location than the one in 2017.,102,,
928,0.97,6478.271,6482.809,"But I'm wondering, are there additional safety precautions needed for other portions of Highland parkway?",102,,
929,0.97,6482.809,6483.91,Has there been an analysis or is there one plant?,102,,
930,0.97,6483.91,6490.484,I'm going to try it--those were a lot of questions.,103,,
931,0.97,6490.484,6492.752,I will try to respond.,103,,
932,0.97,6492.752,6498.024,"I will provide the list of locations that we followed up with funding for, the funding we received.",103,,
933,0.97,6498.024,6498.792,T was after 2017.,103,,
934,0.97,6498.792,6505.332,"So I think 2018, is that correct?",103,,
935,0.97,6505.332,6505.899,The additional funding.,103,,
936,0.97,6505.899,6510.937,Many locations were slides that we responded to that were not originally on the Prioritization list.,103,,
937,0.97,6510.937,6514.674,But had significant impact to the traveling public.,103,,
938,0.97,6514.674,6524.684,Two of them at least I know were on Non- arterial streets so they would not have been on the list to begin with.,103,,
939,0.97,6524.684,6528.421,I will provide that list of the projects we completed with the additional funding.,103,,
940,0.97,6528.421,6529.589,So that was question number one.,103,,
941,0.97,6529.589,6543.77,Question number two was--question number three was Highland Parkway.,103,,
942,0.97,6543.77,6545.171,So we have the original priority list.,103,,
943,0.97,6545.171,6553.179,I think you know Highland park originally was rated in the low priority of those streets.,103,,
944,0.97,6553.179,6562.122,And so one of the things we do look at is the potential in recent history of slides occurring at those locations.,103,,
945,0.97,6562.122,6576.77,"And one of the reasons why we decided to complete the Rayner Avenue South project is we had gotten, over the past couple of years, maybe five years, independent slides at that location.",103,,
946,0.97,6576.77,6588.081,So I think it is something worth Revisiting as we continue on with some of these locations that we continue to see more frequent slides in those locations.,103,,
947,0.97,6588.081,6591.117,That is one of the criteria that goes into the assessment for how we rank the high- priority locations.,103,,
948,0.97,6591.117,6598.124,"As you know, there are eight other criteria that go into that.",103,,
949,0.97,6598.124,6599.659,I think those were the questions.,104,,
950,0.97,6599.659,6600.026,Did I Miss one?,104,,
951,0.97,6600.026,6609.002,Thank you for answering that about the landslides.,105,,
952,0.97,6609.002,6617.41,"I noticed in the capital improvement program budget that we approved for several years, on page 227, there is a landslide mitigation program.",105,,
953,0.97,6617.41,6629.489,"One of the things concerning is that the budget amount drops substantially from 2021, 2022 and beyond.",105,,
954,0.97,6629.489,6631.591,And the budget was approved before the landslides occurred.,105,,
955,0.97,6631.591,6647.874,So that would be something that would be helpful if the Bruce Harrell administration could look at on whether they need to revise the request for a landslide mitigation work going forward.,105,,
956,0.97,6647.874,6655.749,So that we approve the next budget and you have the funding you need to deal with the actual need at hand.,105,,
957,0.97,6655.749,6670.93,"And so, we appreciate in advance you looking into that and we will follow-up with you on the 2019 resolution and try to do more about safety for pedestrians.",105,,
958,0.97,6670.93,6675.902,Just a big thank you to both departments are being here and for this thorough presentation.,105,,
959,0.97,6675.902,6691.885,It shows the benefit of having these Departmens in the committee so that we can coordinate along with all the coordination you are already doing at that level.,105,,
960,0.97,6691.885,6697.557,"Colleagues, we will be ready to move on to the next two items on the agenda which are related to each other.",105,,
961,0.97,6697.557,6698.591,Thank you to Sdot and Spu.,105,,
962,0.97,6698.591,6703.997,Although Sdot will stick around.,105,,
963,0.97,6703.997,6706.132,Why don't we go ahead and move to the next agenda item.,105,,
964,0.97,6706.132,6715.442,Will the clerk please read the title of the next agenda item into the record.,105,,
965,0.97,6715.442,6719.512,"Agenda item two, Seattle Department of transportation safe starts outdoor permits program update.",106,,
966,0.97,6719.512,6723.817,For briefing and discussion.,106,,
967,0.97,6723.817,6724.417,Great.,107,,
968,0.97,6724.417,6729.389,"And just for the viewing public, this is a larger effort by the city.",107,,
969,0.97,6729.389,6737.997,And we will zero in on one counsel bill spot--sponsored by Councilmember Strauss.,107,,
970,0.97,6737.997,6742.035,We want to speak to that on item three in particular.,107,,
971,0.97,6742.035,6749.576,"If you don't mind, we will just jump into the Sdot overall presentation on this.",107,,
972,0.97,6749.576,6749.943,Welcome Sdot.,107,,
973,0.97,6749.943,6750.376,Welcome back Sdot.,107,,
974,0.97,6750.376,6750.91,Thank you.,108,,
975,0.97,6750.91,6751.711,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,108,,
976,0.97,6751.711,6756.082,I'm happy to be here today.,108,,
977,0.97,6756.082,6762.255,Casey Rogers is with me this morning to share the slide deck.,108,,
978,0.97,6762.255,6763.723,I am Alyse Nelson.,108,,
979,0.97,6763.723,6773.466,"And the acting public space manager for our team in Street use, a division within Sdot and we are excited to be here today to give you this update.",108,,
980,0.97,6773.466,6773.8,Next slide.,108,,
981,0.97,6773.8,6781.007,We would like to ground in the core values which is here on the screen.,109,,
982,0.97,6781.007,6795.788,"And public space management, we release the our role is working with people, residents, organizations and businesses to enhance neighborhoods, strengthen communities and widen public spaces and promote economic vitality.",109,,
983,0.97,6795.788,6806.099,"We build with ability and bring that to city streets and make sure we are accounted for mobility, safety and the equity of our work.",109,,
984,0.97,6806.099,6808.067,Next slide please.,109,,
985,0.97,6808.067,6812.972,So today we have been asked to give a brief presentation on where we are at with our safe start program.,109,,
986,0.97,6812.972,6821.114,And then we will transition into the legislation that is the next agenda item.,109,,
987,0.97,6821.114,6821.481,Next slide.,109,,
988,0.97,6821.481,6828.621,"So to start off here, we will start by talking about the background, outreach and learning summary.",109,,
989,0.97,6828.621,6830.056,Here is the safe start program background.,109,,
990,0.97,6830.056,6834.394,We began with effort in the summer of 2020.,109,,
991,0.97,6834.394,6847.24,"And really, we are here today because our (Indiscernible) expires may of 2022 and the request is to expand until January of 2023.",109,,
992,0.97,6847.24,6863.489,"We began safe start permitting, recognizing that we had existing permit programs for Úthese types of uses but we needed to work quickly and needed to reduce our fees with struggling businesses that were willing to get out and use the Right-Of-Way right away.",109,,
993,0.97,6863.489,6871.464,So we came and were able to create a streamlined process.,109,,
994,0.97,6871.464,6874.467,"Pre-Pandemic, we had about 400 Cafcs permitted.",109,,
995,0.97,6874.467,6878.471,We work with about 115 food vendors and had 20 businesses with retail displays.,109,,
996,0.97,6878.471,6883.142,"In the past year and a half, we have seen a significant increase in the permit volumes.",109,,
997,0.97,6883.142,6885.812,Particularly outdoor Cafcs that have used the curb space.,109,,
998,0.97,6885.812,6890.116,Today we have issued 276 permits.,109,,
999,0.97,6890.116,6901.027,"Pre-Pandemic, our permit fees ranged roughly between $300.4000 depending on what you were doing and where you were.",109,,
1000,0.97,6901.027,6909.802,"In 2021, we received a one-time Federal recovery grant that helps offset some of the lost revenue of $300,000.",109,,
1001,0.97,6909.802,6910.136,Next slide.,109,,
1002,0.97,6910.136,6921.447,What we have been doing since we talked to you all last is a lot of outreach.,110,,
1003,0.97,6921.447,6936.429,"We really wanted to make sure W were hearing from people, both businesses, residents and Stakeholders to understand how the safe start program was working and to consider what we wanted to do and move forward into our permanent programs that we already have.",110,,
1004,0.97,6936.429,6947.073,We had a Multipronged approach including a general survey as well as focused outreach with community Stakeholders and program evaluations we have done in house.,110,,
1005,0.97,6947.073,6949.976,Our survey had an overwhelming response.,110,,
1006,0.97,6949.976,6951.311,"We had over 10,000 people provide responses.",110,,
1007,0.97,6951.311,6955.048,That has been a lot of data we had to sift through.,110,,
1008,0.97,6955.048,6965.491,We also wanted to make sure we were hearing from folks that we didn't hear too much from during the survey.,110,,
1009,0.97,6965.491,6974.5,"So with businesses and organizations, Seattle restaurant alliance, disability rights advocates.",110,,
1010,0.97,6974.5,6976.169,Next slide.,110,,
1011,0.97,6976.169,6983.209,This graphic highlights the overwhelming positive support we received from our survey.,111,,
1012,0.97,6983.209,6987.714,90% of respondents supported Cafcs and street closures for dining and shopping.,111,,
1013,0.97,6987.714,6990.95,Food trucks also received a high level of support.,111,,
1014,0.97,6990.95,6995.188,Retail displays receive the lowest level of support although it was still positive overall.,111,,
1015,0.97,6995.188,6995.521,Next slide.,111,,
1016,0.97,6995.521,7006.866,"Even though we had overwhelming positive support in the safe start survey, we wanted to understand what was working well and where there were areas for improvement.",112,,
1017,0.97,7006.866,7014.507,We wanted to see the areas for improvement so we could consider that in the future Hanges.,112,,
1018,0.97,7014.507,7020.78,So people were asked to comment on what they liked the most and what they liked the least.,112,,
1019,0.97,7020.78,7023.583,This summarizes what we heard.,112,,
1020,0.97,7023.583,7037.13,"People felt like it was great to get outside and dying during the pandemic and they liked how the streets had some vibrancy, being able to support small businesses and get together with people in the communities.",112,,
1021,0.97,7037.13,7051.477,"What could be improved, you will know that it impacts parking and travel and in particular with Street closures and mobility impact and generally, maintenance around the spaces themselves.",112,,
1022,0.97,7051.477,7055.782,"In addition to the survey, we have been doing a lot of listening and learning.",112,,
1023,0.97,7055.782,7066.926,So participating businesses have called out how the streamlined process LOWERS barriers to a vocation and free permits have been critical to them and we have been seen as a partner during this process.,112,,
1024,0.97,7066.926,7080.706,"As we think about heading out of the world in future what is it a package, there is support or lowering fees, in particular looking at the fees we charge for occupation of the Right-Of-Way.",112,,
1025,0.97,7080.706,7095.922,"Even though our permits have been free and we have been a great partner, businesses still note that there is cost to they are having to take on in setting up and managing these spaces and that could be of barrier to injury.",112,,
1026,0.97,7095.922,7105.198,We are also talking to researchers at Uw and UNC and they have noted long-term public health and resilience benefits to creating outdoor public spaces.,112,,
1027,0.97,7105.198,7118.077,"In addition, we learned that talking to partners and community when we are setting up programs is really critical to making sure we create great public spaces in the long run.",112,,
1028,0.97,7118.077,7120.98,Now we will talk briefly about the draft program mission and themes guiding our work.,112,,
1029,0.97,7120.98,7130.756,Here on the screen is our program mission which is to develop an equitable and Iterative approach to continue the success of the safe start program.,112,,
1030,0.97,7130.756,7138.197,"And to help small businesses thrive, increase the vibrancy of our public realm and needed access and mobility.",112,,
1031,0.97,7138.197,7144.871,This draft builds on the Sdot core values of safety and mobility.,112,,
1032,0.97,7144.871,7145.838,"Sustainability, livability and excellence.",112,,
1033,0.97,7145.838,7146.439,Next slide.,112,,
1034,0.97,7146.439,7154.514,"Briefly, we pulled out three main themes to help guide our work as we continue for what is next.",112,,
1035,0.97,7154.514,7155.815,"Number one, we see equity as critical.",112,,
1036,0.97,7155.815,7163.689,We want to influence strategies that support Bipoc owned small businesses.,112,,
1037,0.97,7163.689,7173.032,We want to provide excellent coaching in language and promotion materials and look into fees and how that could be a barrier to entry.,112,,
1038,0.97,7173.032,7180.239,And other options we might consider like looking to have some Preapproved designs which could help businesses utilize the program in an easier way.,112,,
1039,0.97,7180.239,7188.147,"Regarding flexibility, codified rules can be a barrier and we see it to be nimble.",112,,
1040,0.97,7188.147,7198.457,We want to have that balance at find rules that are consistent and work well for people of all ages and abilities to get in and around Seattle.,112,,
1041,0.97,7198.457,7201.727,Also provide flexibility for businesses where appropriate we see our program is really Iterative.,112,,
1042,0.97,7201.727,7206.566,"That is what we learned, with the pandemic has helped us learn.",112,,
1043,0.97,7206.566,7210.303,So we want to be will to continue to learn from evaluations and adjust as we go.,112,,
1044,0.97,7210.303,7216.876,"And so related to a collaborative approach, we have seen a deep appreciation for Sdot.",112,,
1045,0.97,7216.876,7225.117,Which is worth noting because the agencies can sometimes be seen as an optional.,112,,
1046,0.97,7225.117,7231.057,We want to continue the good work we have been doing to build relationships and find businesses with successful outcomes.,112,,
1047,0.97,7231.057,7234.827,This will take more time and resources but we see this as a value add.,112,,
1048,0.97,7234.827,7236.896,Next slide.,112,,
1049,0.97,7236.896,7244.971,The next section is to let you know where we are headed with draft changes.,113,,
1050,0.97,7244.971,7266.092,"So now we plan to take all of what we have learned so far and put together a package that will be ready this spring and talk about how we want to take what we learn from the pandemic and the safe start program into the permanent legislation for outdoor dining, merchandise display, bending and street activation.",113,,
1051,0.97,7266.092,7283.542,Having a draft this spring and having the extension in front of Council today will be really helpful because will be able to have another chance to talk to people and see if we got it right and where we have room for improvement before we get the final package to counsel.,113,,
1052,0.97,7283.542,7294.253,"In general, what we're looking at is having a program that will provide more opportunities for public space activity and support Bipoc owned small businesses in Seattle.",113,,
1053,0.97,7294.253,7299.925,We want more promoting tools like seasonal permits.,113,,
1054,0.97,7299.925,7307.733,And crafting design centers that will focus on safety and mobility as well as accessibility and continue to allow structures that help create spaces that people can use your around if that is what the business desires.,113,,
1055,0.97,7307.733,7314.674,We also are looking at new ways to do things for merchandise display.,113,,
1056,0.97,7314.674,7322.948,We are thinking that having guidelines that would allow some merchants to set up retail displays without a permit and guidelines they would have to follow instead.,113,,
1057,0.97,7322.948,7324.45,Vendors have been really hard hit during the pandemic.,113,,
1058,0.97,7324.45,7341.5,We are looking to create new permit options for people to try out sites more simply and Affordably and in looking at ways to try out new types of vending with building up programs we piloted during the pandemic like market street.,113,,
1059,0.97,7341.5,7351.21,"For Street Activations, we want to continue to build upon what we have done during the pandemic and create more options for street closures and Activations that will create great places for people to gather, dine and shop.",113,,
1060,0.97,7351.21,7365.024,We are excited to have opportunities to continue to support Seattle businesses and think about what we are doing and what we can learn and bring into the future legislation.,113,,
1061,0.97,7365.024,7365.358,Next slide.,113,,
1062,0.97,7365.358,7366.359,Here is where we are at.,114,,
1063,0.97,7366.359,7369.295,It is legislation in front of you.,114,,
1064,0.97,7369.295,7375.201,"If this is approved, we will move into the winter and finishing up the draft proposal and to the racial equity Toolkit analysis.",114,,
1065,0.97,7375.201,7409.735,"And in the spring, will extend to the new expiration date and have the draft package ready for review and engagement in the summer, we will be back with our legislation, legislate a package and look to finalize the plans that will have a great time for people to then be able to come into compliance with the new more permanent program that when the permit expires in January . so that will end today patients brief update by Sdot.",114,,
1066,0.97,7409.735,7413.506,I hope it gives you a good idea where we are at today.,114,,
1067,0.97,7413.506,7416.609,Casey Rogers and I are here and happy to answer any questions that you have.,114,,
1068,0.97,7416.609,7423.582,Thank you very much.,115,,
1069,0.97,7423.582,7424.75,"Colleagues, any questions at this stage?",115,,
1070,0.97,7424.75,7435.227,We also have the opportunity when we talk about the counsel bill by Councilmember Strauss to extend the free permits.,115,,
1071,0.97,7435.227,7436.896,Councilmember Morales.,115,,
1072,0.97,7436.896,7439.799,Thank you.,116,,
1073,0.97,7439.799,7445.204,Thank you Councilmember Strauss for this work and thank you to Sdot.,116,,
1074,0.97,7445.204,7446.972,I think this is really exciting.,116,,
1075,0.97,7446.972,7451.977,"I would love to see more activation on the South end, I would say.",116,,
1076,0.97,7451.977,7454.246,Neighbors are excited about this.,116,,
1077,0.97,7454.246,7462.955,And we have seen a lot of our small businesses that we know are still struggling.,116,,
1078,0.97,7462.955,7470.563,And so this is the kind of improvement that really brings that activation back to commercial corridors.,116,,
1079,0.97,7470.563,7477.336,"And also, honestly it is a big safety improvement too to have more people out.",116,,
1080,0.97,7477.336,7483.809,We had the Columbia city patio during the late part of the pandemic.,116,,
1081,0.97,7483.809,7488.747,I know folks are eager to bring that back to Ferdinand Street and just be able to enjoy it.,116,,
1082,0.97,7488.747,7505.364,"With that said, I am also really hearing from neighbors on residential streets about how we can do something similar, this technical urbanism.",116,,
1083,0.97,7505.364,7509.902,Give permission and to do this sort of thing on residential streets.,116,,
1084,0.97,7509.902,7533.626,"For example, in the last few weeks, my office has heard from parents who live on South Holly near Mlk elementary who are asking for permission to put planters outside to create kind of makeshift barriers, or paint the street or add trees that might slow down people speeding through their neighborhood.",116,,
1085,0.97,7533.626,7549.808,And so I'm wondering if you could talk just a little bit about how we might translate this kind of program into a residential version or a more neighborhood version of this.,116,,
1086,0.97,7549.808,7555.514,"And if you have thoughts right now, that would be great.",116,,
1087,0.97,7555.514,7561.587,I do just want to signal my interest working with Sdot to try to work through something like that.,116,,
1088,0.97,7561.587,7562.454,Thank you.,117,,
1089,0.97,7562.454,7566.392,That is really--I think we are excited to hear that.,117,,
1090,0.97,7566.392,7577.303,We do have kind of some existing programs that you are probably aware of like the play Street permit that allows parents or community groups to close streets short-term Foreplay.,117,,
1091,0.97,7577.303,7583.409,"I think what you are talking about is moral long term, physical improvement.",117,,
1092,0.97,7583.409,7594.053,Those do come up in a variety of ways and there are ways we work with transportation operation divisions if they come up in the context of the permit review.,117,,
1093,0.97,7594.053,7597.489,I think I would be happy to talk more about how those projects might make sense.,117,,
1094,0.97,7597.489,7615.608,"And in general, we want--the street Activations is kind of a large bucket and it really is trying to create space for community really to feel some sense of ownership over the street.",117,,
1095,0.97,7615.608,7617.81,"Either short term, seasonally or longer term.",117,,
1096,0.97,7617.81,7627.086,I do see that there could be some good conversations to have about how that translates to the more residential context too.,117,,
1097,0.97,7627.086,7627.686,Councilmember Strauss.,118,,
1098,0.97,7627.686,7632.925,"Thank you, chair.",119,,
1099,0.97,7632.925,7635.194,"Thank you, Alyse Nelson and Casey.",119,,
1100,0.97,7635.194,7640.632,I'm happy this program is operating and I'm really looking forward to the work ahead.,119,,
1101,0.97,7640.632,7647.473,"I guess, chair, we haven't gotten to my bill yet.",119,,
1102,0.97,7647.473,7650.576,I will probably make these comments and I won't say much more.,119,,
1103,0.97,7650.576,7667.826,I would just note that the bill that I have before the committee today is intended to give Sdot with is needed to ensure we get the policies right size for our city and that we are able to keep outdoor dining as a part of the fabric of the city forever.,119,,
1104,0.97,7667.826,7669.561,Or at least through my lifetime.,119,,
1105,0.97,7669.561,7673.465,And we just want to make sure the policies are right sized.,119,,
1106,0.97,7673.465,7677.569,"As I listened to the presentation today, there were a couple of things that really stood out to me.",119,,
1107,0.97,7677.569,7679.938,One was the framework.,119,,
1108,0.97,7679.938,7687.546,We always had sidewalk Cafcs and have always had park Litz as a tool in the urban space Toolkit.,119,,
1109,0.97,7687.546,7693.652,I would say that they were often times too small and often times too expensive.,119,,
1110,0.97,7693.652,7703.095,And the pandemic give us a chance to look at how we operate the program again.,119,,
1111,0.97,7703.095,7707.299,"As Sdot noted in the presentation and Alyse Nelson noted in the presentation, the survey results were incredibly positive.",119,,
1112,0.97,7707.299,7712.771,"The lowest rating I saw was 59%, which is still above 50.",119,,
1113,0.97,7712.771,7732.558,"One of the things I heard from skeptics over this program and there are some out there, is that during the cold weather months, we will see a decline in use.",119,,
1114,0.97,7732.558,7744.837,"The winter, during that cold snap we had with presentations, I was out on Bollard Avenue and 37 every weather.",119,,
1115,0.97,7744.837,7745.437,Outdoor dining situation.,119,,
1116,0.97,7745.437,7747.272,The East side was quite full.,119,,
1117,0.97,7747.272,7748.34,The outer city was totally full.,119,,
1118,0.97,7748.34,7756.915,The group I was with was concerned about the Duwamish variant.,119,,
1119,0.97,7756.915,7758.05,-- the Oma cranberry in.,119,,
1120,0.97,7758.05,7760.219,So we bundled up and sat outside.,119,,
1121,0.97,7760.219,7768.627,"I think this is the nature of the pandemic where we are still at, which is we will see some Verys continue to spike.",119,,
1122,0.97,7768.627,7780.939,"And at times, the people's comfort level with indoor dining--so this was a moment in 37 every weather where we were all outdoors.",119,,
1123,0.97,7780.939,7781.707,The groups felt safe.,119,,
1124,0.97,7781.707,7787.279,We were as warm as we could be in the situation.,119,,
1125,0.97,7787.279,7794.153,So the policy we will discuss is getting the policies corrected.,119,,
1126,0.97,7794.153,7802.261,We do need to make sure that we are regulating the look and feel and make sure we are reducing all possible barriers.,119,,
1127,0.97,7802.261,7807.499,We need to make sure the structures are safe.,119,,
1128,0.97,7807.499,7812.204,We need to make sure that our businesses have access.,119,,
1129,0.97,7812.204,7818.41,The reason for increasing access is because it doesn't create a barrier.,119,,
1130,0.97,7818.41,7831.156,"Also the cost of this permit right now while we are figuring out these interim designs and policies, allows more businesses to participate.",119,,
1131,0.97,7831.156,7836.628,"In the old program, in my opinion, we were charging too much money for the amount of space we were providing.",119,,
1132,0.97,7836.628,7844.903,"And so, I'm very excited this year about Sdot talking about the different types of permits.",119,,
1133,0.97,7844.903,7846.338,The different tools in the Toolkit.,119,,
1134,0.97,7846.338,7852.444,Whether it is outdoor retail or just curbside or on the sidewalk.,119,,
1135,0.97,7852.444,7859.851,Or Ballard Avenue.,119,,
1136,0.97,7859.851,7863.822,Turning the whole Street into a Cafc street.,119,,
1137,0.97,7863.822,7873.665,We need to get these policies so that they are able to be not only expanded to the West--rest of the city but that they are easy to use.,119,,
1138,0.97,7873.665,7882.241,"Councilmember Morales, you are able to look at the options and say, I want these two in this area and maybe those two in this other area.",119,,
1139,0.97,7882.241,7887.012,So I want to make sure I give the team the time they need to get these policies right.,119,,
1140,0.97,7887.012,7897.522,And so we need to make sure the cost of the permit is right sized because the use of the public Right-Of-Way is also providing revenue generation.,119,,
1141,0.97,7897.522,7904.162,I was talking about the (Indiscernible) completely full.,119,,
1142,0.97,7904.162,7909.835,Indoor spaces and outdoor spaces completely full.,119,,
1143,0.97,7909.835,7914.606,Seeing that increase of sales tax for the city of Seattle.,119,,
1144,0.97,7914.606,7916.308,The cost of the structure can be a barrier.,119,,
1145,0.97,7916.308,7921.146,I'm excited to hear about ways we can reduce the burden.,119,,
1146,0.97,7921.146,7927.986,"Just again, when we are able to create these violent places, we are seeing a net increase in revenue and sales tax and other types of revenue generation.",119,,
1147,0.97,7927.986,7935.627,So that is what I am really excited to bring the Pathway.,119,,
1148,0.97,7935.627,7938.363,And I will hold my comments about the.,119,,
1149,0.97,7938.363,7943.502,Will speak briefly as Ballard Avenue is a pilot for what we are understanding to be a Cafc street.,119,,
1150,0.97,7943.502,7949.875,Senators street that allows for a little bit more wide structures than other places.,119,,
1151,0.97,7949.875,7957.949,It ensures that we are taking into consideration the weighting of plates and goods.,119,,
1152,0.97,7957.949,7961.253,And we are sharing space is easily accessed by all ages and abilities.,119,,
1153,0.97,7961.253,7975.834,And that we are able to make it a beautiful way of reducing the speed and the amount of traffic so that we are really able to create a vibrant place that everyone can enjoy.,119,,
1154,0.97,7975.834,7983.241,"Also, my comments for (Indiscernible) and a moment.",119,,
1155,0.97,7983.241,7987.979,The lesson will say about the Cafc Street pilot is we had a nice and interesting conversation about parking.,119,,
1156,0.97,7987.979,7993.318,Parking is still's muted in these places.,119,,
1157,0.97,7993.318,7997.656,Had we do that?,119,,
1158,0.97,7997.656,8007.599,"For valid Ballard Avenue pilot, looking for spaces not occupied by Cafc structures and that we have 30 minute parking and all ages and abilities parking.",119,,
1159,0.97,8007.599,8008.6,And those things are important.,119,,
1160,0.97,8008.6,8025.15,If you have a quick drop off pickup so I can go grab the sandwich that I Preordered or maybe it's a 30 minute parking spot and I have (Indiscernible) and all ages nd abilities.,119,,
1161,0.97,8025.15,8029.087,Folks that do have a different experience getting around town that they are able to park near where they want to go.,119,,
1162,0.97,8029.087,8042.601,"So we have a lot of (Indiscernible) and chair Pedersen, we will, together with more foundations on the pilot that we can present to you in this Committee at that time.",119,,
1163,0.97,8042.601,8048.306,I will save my comments.,119,,
1164,0.97,8048.306,8049.975,Thank you Alyse and Casey for presenting today.,119,,
1165,0.97,8049.975,8055.747,Let's go ahead and move to item three which is related a lot to this item.,120,,
1166,0.97,8055.747,8057.449,And then we can get moving on that.,120,,
1167,0.97,8057.449,8061.686,I do have some questions.,120,,
1168,0.97,8061.686,8068.894,Some standard questions about cost and FTE debt and risk management and things like that.,120,,
1169,0.97,8068.894,8072.631,Let's go ahead and read item three into the record.,120,,
1170,0.97,8072.631,8099.958,"Item three, counsel bill 120256, in ordinance related to Street and sidewalk use, amending ordinance 126474 and the street use permit fee schedule authorized by section 15.04.074 of the Seattle municipal code and amending section two and section three of ordinance 126339.",121,,
1171,0.97,8099.958,8104.362,For discussion and possible vote.,121,,
1172,0.97,8104.362,8104.996,Thank you.,122,,
1173,0.97,8104.996,8108.233,"As we will try to do in the committee, we will always be able to do it.",122,,
1174,0.97,8108.233,8111.169,We will try to hear counsel bills twice.,122,,
1175,0.97,8111.169,8112.938,So that is the plan with this one.,122,,
1176,0.97,8112.938,8122.881,So we will hear it back on February 15th and then it will go straight to full counsel there.,122,,
1177,0.97,8122.881,8124.716,To extend the permits.,122,,
1178,0.97,8124.716,8132.19,"And we have city council central staff with us, Calvin chow and the same Sdot team with us.",122,,
1179,0.97,8132.19,8139.364,I do have some questions for Calvin about this.,122,,
1180,0.97,8139.364,8143.568,"Councilmember Strauss, as a sponsor, did you want to speak to the specifics of the request?",122,,
1181,0.97,8143.568,8146.471,"Thank you, share.",123,,
1182,0.97,8146.471,8154.713,"What we understood when we do the initial bill--let me take us back a step which is, we were able to create this free permit.",123,,
1183,0.97,8154.713,8168.36,"And we extended the duration because we had not been able to create--when we are in the middle of a pandemic, we are not able to have that look and feel of reopening.",123,,
1184,0.97,8168.36,8185.11,"When the policies still weren't ready for prime time and we are still evaluating how the pandemic--where we were in the pandemic and how we were responding to it, the permits were set to expire in the middle of this year.",123,,
1185,0.97,8185.11,8191.283,And so I said at the beginning of the year that we need more time.,123,,
1186,0.97,8191.283,8196.888,So what we are available for is the exact same Billy passed the last time that extended it.,123,,
1187,0.97,8196.888,8200.091,We it last April which extended from May 21st until May 22nd.,123,,
1188,0.97,8200.091,8206.531,And then extending it from May 22 until January 23.,123,,
1189,0.97,8206.531,8220.378,"I will state on the record that as we proceed through this program and evaluation, if we need more time, I will come back and ask for more time pick it is important that we get the policies right.",123,,
1190,0.97,8220.378,8233.258,So that we don't have to come back and redo them again in the future or so we are not creating unintended consequences for business owners or the people that walk on the street or drive on the street or bike on the street or people who live in the communities.,123,,
1191,0.97,8233.258,8237.562,Make sure we get this right the first time.,123,,
1192,0.97,8237.562,8245.17,So this is why I mix--requesting an extension of the street Cafc program.,123,,
1193,0.97,8245.17,8245.57,"Thank you, chair.",123,,
1194,0.97,8245.57,8251.443,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,124,,
1195,0.97,8251.443,8252.11,We have Calvin chow.,124,,
1196,0.97,8252.11,8257.949,Did you want to make any comments about the bill?,124,,
1197,0.97,8257.949,8263.088,I have standard questions I asked about any program we could get on the record.,124,,
1198,0.97,8263.088,8265.69,Do you have any introductory remarks?,124,,
1199,0.97,8265.69,8273.798,Legislation is very straightforward and has been covered in the previous presentation.,125,,
1200,0.97,8273.798,8274.265,No comments from me.,125,,
1201,0.97,8274.265,8275.834,Okay.,126,,
1202,0.97,8275.834,8276.301,All right.,126,,
1203,0.97,8276.301,8282.073,And so I support the extension of the permits.,126,,
1204,0.97,8282.073,8283.274,I will say that off about.,126,,
1205,0.97,8283.274,8295.987,"Since we are still in the middle of the Covid-19 related economic impact on small businesses, we heard the alliance, and during public comment and support the extension.",126,,
1206,0.97,8295.987,8297.956,These are questions that don't necessarily need to be answered today.,126,,
1207,0.97,8297.956,8315.573,"But as we--sensor has been a signal for--may be some of us want to do this permanently, I want to get some questions out because it becomes less about Covid-19 and more about a program for the city and that Trade-Off there.",126,,
1208,0.97,8315.573,8322.38,"So any new program, I'm always interested in hearing about the cost or the expense.",126,,
1209,0.97,8322.38,8329.988,That would be the close cost and the net financial benefits that we could be achieving here.,126,,
1210,0.97,8329.988,8336.861,Some looking at the cost--what is the foregone revenue?,126,,
1211,0.97,8336.861,8346.438,"And owe some of the revenue depends on what type of permits are being applied for, if it is literally taking of a parking space, it would be collecting parking meter revenue.",126,,
1212,0.97,8346.438,8358.75,What is the foregone revenue on an annual basis that we can expect on the current fee charge that we would normally charge?,126,,
1213,0.97,8358.75,8372.831,"And in terms of running the program, if we were to keep it going, how many Sdot employees would be dedicated to do that text we issued 276 permits.",126,,
1214,0.97,8372.831,8377.502,And there is excitement about the programs so does that mean we need more FTE residence and what is the cost.,126,,
1215,0.97,8377.502,8379.037,Looking at the cost to run the program.,126,,
1216,0.97,8379.037,8385.343,Are we pulling employees from other parts of Sdot to do this?,126,,
1217,0.97,8385.343,8390.315,Or is it additive?,126,,
1218,0.97,8390.315,8391.649,"And then, what does success look like?",126,,
1219,0.97,8391.649,8394.886,How do we measure success in the program?,126,,
1220,0.97,8394.886,8401.693,And of the survey is really great if you took the survey.,126,,
1221,0.97,8401.693,8404.963,What does it look like going forward.,126,,
1222,0.97,8404.963,8417.742,"I know in the University district, when the program was first discussed, there were different types of opinions about it based on the type of business.",126,,
1223,0.97,8417.742,8429.454,"And so the (Indiscernible) at 65%, owned by Bipoc or by women and they were split on it in terms of noticing if they had a Take-Out business, they were less interested.",126,,
1224,0.97,8429.454,8433.258,"Or if they had a restaurant, they wanted to expand because of social distance requirements.",126,,
1225,0.97,8433.258,8434.726,They were very much in favor of it.,126,,
1226,0.97,8434.726,8439.264,So I didn't know if you will be doing ongoing surveying.,126,,
1227,0.97,8439.264,8456.147,"And then the liability, risk management, could you explain--the requirement to have insurance coverage since they are putting customers into the streets.",126,,
1228,0.97,8456.147,8457.916,Just want to know about the risk management.,126,,
1229,0.97,8457.916,8459.651,Obviously this is a great thing about having the pilot.,126,,
1230,0.97,8459.651,8465.99,We have a lot of data on the fact that we have not had a problem there with that.,126,,
1231,0.97,8465.99,8472.697,And so if we could have central staff start with those and then go to Sdot.,126,,
1232,0.97,8472.697,8476.835,"Calvin, if you can go first.",126,,
1233,0.97,8476.835,8480.638,Can I jump in?,127,,
1234,0.97,8480.638,8481.406,Sure.,128,,
1235,0.97,8481.406,8492.517,I think some of the questions you asked are good questions and are a bit subjective to--what does success look like?,128,,
1236,0.97,8492.517,8494.986,"As the sponsor of the bill, I would like to speak to that.",128,,
1237,0.97,8494.986,8502.327,"And I would lie to quickly speak to the (Indiscernible) earlier in the pandemic, we stop charging for parking places.",128,,
1238,0.97,8502.327,8510.702,So that was part of how the program initially got off the ground.,128,,
1239,0.97,8510.702,8518.576,"And during the Federal relief conversations, the $300,000 we discussed.",128,,
1240,0.97,8518.576,8520.245,To create programs like this.,128,,
1241,0.97,8520.245,8529.053,I did some background work to make sure we were able to ensure that we weren't running at a deficit for this program.,128,,
1242,0.97,8529.053,8533.658,I will let Sdot speak to the employees and what the internal cost is to one program.,128,,
1243,0.97,8533.658,8542.834,"From my understanding, this is the exact same team that was running the public space management previous to the pandemic.",128,,
1244,0.97,8542.834,8552.71,So the (Indiscernible) and that team was Tasked with many public space engagements that have since been put on pause because of the pandemic.,128,,
1245,0.97,8552.71,8556.281,So I will let Sdot speak directly to that.,128,,
1246,0.97,8556.281,8563.021,It is the cost of doing business and was set up Pre- pandemic.,128,,
1247,0.97,8563.021,8594.118,We asked him what does success look like and I will speak from a subjective place so that we have the right cost to businesses and ending vibrancy to the neighborhoods and small businesses and the Sdot public space team has a program of measuring public space.,128,,
1248,0.97,8594.118,8604.796,And watching and tracking how many people are passing through.,128,,
1249,0.97,8604.796,8618.91,"And the analysis to understand the gender, race and other breakdowns and what success looks like.",128,,
1250,0.97,8618.91,8622.981,It looks like a (Indiscernible) rate to the small businesses.,128,,
1251,0.97,8622.981,8631.222,And this would demonstrate the subjectivity.,128,,
1252,0.97,8631.222,8637.662,And (Indiscernible) I will that subject matter experts and some of the technical questions.,128,,
1253,0.97,8637.662,8641.232,I just wanted to share my thoughts at the outset.,128,,
1254,0.97,8641.232,8642.266,Thank you.,129,,
1255,0.97,8642.266,8650.341,"Calvin, in terms of the foregone revenue, do we have an estimate of what we would have collected?",129,,
1256,0.97,8650.341,8651.743,We do have an estimate.,130,,
1257,0.97,8651.743,8668.793,"And before I get too much into that, I want to highlight that we need to be careful of focusing on legislative--which is an eight month extension of the temporary pilot program as far as what is the cost and the impact and how the managed.",130,,
1258,0.97,8668.793,8676.3,The issue you raised I think are great questions that we can hold back and make sure we get good answers from Sdot as they put together the draft proposal.,130,,
1259,0.97,8676.3,8680.838,Because I have not seen that yet and they have not presented it to us yet.,130,,
1260,0.97,8680.838,8693.251,So I just want to make a bit of a distinction between the ultimate proposal which we have not seen in this eight month extension right now.,130,,
1261,0.97,8693.251,8700.191,"I went through the permit cost with Transacting earlier this week and we came up with about a 420,000-Dollar cost.",130,,
1262,0.97,8700.191,8715.173,"If all the permits were continued under the existing--with the previous cost of the permits would be, it would be about $420,000.",130,,
1263,0.97,8715.173,8720.211,Assuming that they all chose to take those costs and go forward with it.,130,,
1264,0.97,8720.211,8721.446,Is that an eight month period?,131,,
1265,0.97,8721.446,8722.547,"It is in eight month period, yes.",132,,
1266,0.97,8722.547,8728.286,So annualized would be 601 roughly.,133,,
1267,0.97,8728.286,8738.563,Thank you.,134,,
1268,0.97,8739.53,8740.832,If I can keep asking.,135,,
1269,0.97,8740.832,8754.679,"That is a good point, Calvin, in terms of, are we looking at the extension which I support versus when we talk about making a Programpermanent post pandemic.",135,,
1270,0.97,8754.679,8767.458,It is for a would like answers to these so I just wanted to get those out there for now and neck look forward to staff analysis when we get the Sdot legislation or doing something more permanent.,135,,
1271,0.97,8767.458,8778.469,"I think the expectation is that there will be a new fee structure attached to this and we will have to understand, will it is our expectation for parking revenue?",136,,
1272,0.97,8778.469,8782.573,Because that affects what we think we should be charging for parking spaces for instance.,136,,
1273,0.97,8782.573,8785.51,And then those of been changing over the last couple years as well.,136,,
1274,0.97,8785.51,8799.123,"I think it is actually going to be, when we get the proposal, any sort of formal fixed proposal will affect the rest of the street use cost center as well.",136,,
1275,0.97,8799.123,8804.162,So it is going to have to be understood in the context of how we are collecting all of our revenue through the cost center.,136,,
1276,0.97,8804.162,8808.499,So it does become more complicated.,136,,
1277,0.97,8808.499,8816.607,But having your list of issues gives us a great start of things to make sure that we cover when the proposal comes forward.,136,,
1278,0.97,8816.607,8817.241,Councilmember Strauss.,137,,
1279,0.97,8817.241,8817.909,"Thank you, chair.",138,,
1280,0.97,8817.909,8829.554,"I just wanted to highlight that we are keeping this is a program in the temporary moment so that we can--as we said in initial remarks, so that we can get the cost right sized.",138,,
1281,0.97,8829.554,8832.256,We can't make it so extensive that small businesses won't use.,138,,
1282,0.97,8832.256,8839.197,And we need to make sure that we have a cost there.,138,,
1283,0.97,8839.197,8841.299,That is something Sdot has been clear with on the get go.,138,,
1284,0.97,8841.299,8855.313,"And talking about foregone revenue, it is really important to take into consideration the revenue generation that is occurring from people purchasing retail in the streets.",138,,
1285,0.97,8855.313,8865.957,"And also the parking that we are getting revenue from on the same streets, we would not necessarily be able to revenue--generate revenue from parking with small businesses during the pandemic.",138,,
1286,0.97,8865.957,8885.276,"I think that especially is (Indiscernible) where given time the businesses were shuttered, it is trying times for the small businesses and have not given them this tool, we would not have had a reason for people.",138,,
1287,0.97,8885.276,8890.615,"And Leslie, I would say that we had the habit recently of expanding paid parking zones.",139,,
1288,0.97,8890.615,8893.217,And I know that conversation continues to occur.,139,,
1289,0.97,8893.217,8902.627,"And so there is an issue with foregone revenue . Thank you for letting me pipe up again, chair.",139,,
1290,0.97,8902.627,8903.227,Of course.,140,,
1291,0.97,8903.227,8909.3,"For me, it is really just trying to Parse out the pandemic response which I totally supported.",140,,
1292,0.97,8909.3,8914.238,"And because they are signaling about doing something permanent, I just want to get my questions out there early and make sure that they are answered.",140,,
1293,0.97,8914.238,8926.384,I do have a quick question about the current situation for Calvin or Sdot in terms of the reliability issues.,140,,
1294,0.97,8926.384,8928.753,Could you explain how that is taken care of currently?,140,,
1295,0.97,8928.753,8930.388,Yes.,141,,
1296,0.97,8930.388,8932.39,"Calvin, are you okay if I take that one?",141,,
1297,0.97,8932.39,8944.168,So our (Indiscernible) standard language about (Indiscernible) and insurance.,142,,
1298,0.97,8944.168,8950.541,"So just like before, the continues with standard conditions on any permit we issue.",142,,
1299,0.97,8950.541,8961.552,And so the expectation is that the businesses that are working with us have the right insurance and are signing off with information about,142,,
1300,0.97,8986.51,8990.348,Justin a slightly different direction I really appreciate your taking the time to get this right.,143,,
1301,0.97,8990.348,9027.518,"In the previous presentation as they mention it still 50%, the survey shows lower support for a sidewalk retail display and I'm assuming that this may be related to mobility access issues and really hoping we are doing everything we can to create a system that Proactively addresses those.",143,,
1302,0.97,9027.518,9040.331,Although some enforcement might be needed from a planning approach and would love to hear little bit more about what we are doing in that area.,143,,
1303,0.97,9040.331,9078.302,"There was recent lab piece looking at New York city's open streets program and looking at how, these are moving beyond experimentation and becoming fixtures of the urban Streetscape . It's really important to Proactively before approving the Grilli understand the potential public access issues for folks.",143,,
1304,0.97,9078.302,9113.504,One of the things it looks like they are doing in New York or proposing to do is making sure folks with lived experiences are at the literal table on approving these . There is a suggestion that residence receive a Stipend to test out new structures citywide.,143,,
1305,0.97,9114.371,9123.581,We have put into not ensuring that we are using a normative approach to approving these.,143,,
1306,0.97,9123.581,9152.71,I'm concerned what we are looking at the service we are looking at the high percentages of support and to me that reflects a potential concern that we are using a normative approach to permitting these very popular additions.,143,,
1307,0.97,9152.71,9154.712,I can try to talk about that a bit.,144,,
1308,0.97,9154.712,9162.653,Thank you for the question.,144,,
1309,0.97,9162.653,9171.929,I think we see part of the reason we do permitting at all to really make sure we are thinking about mobility and access.,144,,
1310,0.97,9171.929,9185.91,One of the reasons we exist is to make sure they are done well and we have the opportunity to work in more of an education capacity during the process.,144,,
1311,0.97,9185.91,9193.017,If we need to and enforcement capacity.,144,,
1312,0.97,9193.017,9229.62,"One of the things I would say, we looking to see how we can up our game with education and information really helps businesses understands their responsibilities around the 88 and how to make sure their spaces are available for people who may use a wheelchair customers for example and we also make sure that the space that remains the pedestrian clear zone is open and available for people that need to use the sidewalk to walk.",144,,
1313,0.97,9229.62,9231.956,Whether they are detecting with a cane or using a wheelchair.,144,,
1314,0.97,9231.956,9248.672,A lot of our standards we have have minimum widths maintain and standards around pedestrian straight path to make sure it is not Jogged unnecessarily.,144,,
1315,0.97,9248.672,9251.842,We implemented some rules.,144,,
1316,0.97,9251.842,9253.911,At the edges they don't have fences.,144,,
1317,0.97,9253.911,9263.887,People navigating can find that first instead of running into a table or chair.,144,,
1318,0.97,9263.887,9277.334,What I would say at this point is that's a really important and critical piece for us and we have today to have been talking to disability rights advocates groups as a key Stakeholder and the work done to date and will continue to do that.,144,,
1319,0.97,9277.334,9284.875,I like your ideas and thinking about how we could maybe bring folks in.,144,,
1320,0.97,9284.875,9288.979,Thank you for your comments.,144,,
1321,0.97,9288.979,9292.483,Just one additional point.,145,,
1322,0.97,9292.483,9310.501,I don't think it's just a literal question of access or being able to get through an area a person with mobility issues described a Tetris like path.,145,,
1323,0.97,9310.501,9321.078,"It's not just that you can pass, it's how difficult to pass by making legal Jogged in and out of spaces.",145,,
1324,0.97,9321.078,9327.751,I'm just hoping we are not being completely literal about the requirements of the A.D.A.,145,,
1325,0.97,9327.751,9338.162,And we are really engaging people with lived experiences about how they interact in the new public space.,145,,
1326,0.97,9338.162,9340.097,Really appreciate that.,145,,
1327,0.97,9340.097,9341.899,If I could follow up really quickly.,146,,
1328,0.97,9341.899,9352.409,I should mention that we were to produce a Video earlier in the pandemic response.,146,,
1329,0.97,9352.409,9357.347,As well as other relevant things we issue.,146,,
1330,0.97,9357.347,9363.62,Having those a great first step and I would love to continue to do that.,146,,
1331,0.97,9363.62,9374.431,We want to go beyond the minimum and work to create great public spaces accessible for everyone.,146,,
1332,0.97,9374.431,9376.734,Thank you.,147,,
1333,0.97,9376.734,9384.641,Councilmember Morales and then we probably wrap it up.,147,,
1334,0.97,9384.641,9385.909,I will make it quick.,148,,
1335,0.97,9385.909,9390.114,I just wanted to get back to the previous conversation and really offer an anecdote.,148,,
1336,0.97,9390.114,9403.861,We have heard different points of views from business about whether this is something they want and I think especially the food and drink businesses that I have spoken to.,148,,
1337,0.97,9403.861,9407.731,The owners I talked to down here.,148,,
1338,0.97,9407.731,9429.987,"Really appreciate the certainty that being able to take a parking spot or two in front of their business gives them acknowledging that if somebody parks in front of their restaurant, they are not sure if that person is actually going to come in to dine with them or if they will just walk around the neighborhood for an hour or two.",148,,
1339,0.97,9429.987,9443.7,If there is a street cafe there they know the person planted in that bench is actually using the restaurant and enjoying what they have to offer.,148,,
1340,0.97,9443.7,9470.527,I just wanted to offer that perspective because I think it's important to have that consideration when we are thinking about not just the revenue that might be generated by Ticketing but also what it contributes to the vibrancy of the commercial space and to the revenue of the businesses that are benefiting from having these sidewalk cafes there.,148,,
1341,0.97,9470.527,9472.196,Thank you.,148,,
1342,0.97,9472.196,9473.597,It was thank you.,148,,
1343,0.97,9473.597,9484.775,And again just a signal I think there's lots of support to extend this and out of our committee and predict unsavory 15th and go straight to counsel at that point.,148,,
1344,0.97,9484.775,9494.785,Thank you for your leadership and listen to all of the businesses not only in your district but throughout the city.,148,,
1345,0.97,9494.785,9499.389,Did you want to close with anything before we adjourned the meeting?,148,,
1346,0.97,9499.389,9503.694,Nothing to add.,149,,
1347,0.97,9503.694,9512.703,I will be happy to answer any of the questions at the next committee meeting and really what we are looking to do is give them the time to get this right.,149,,
1348,0.97,9512.703,9514.872,Is urgent and generating some revenue.,149,,
1349,0.97,9514.872,9530.087,We are able to manage all of these things for all of these reasons we want the policies right for our beautiful city of Seattle.,149,,
1350,0.97,9530.087,9554.945,"It was thank you Councilmember and thank you for your innovative approach to this and for administering it and really helping out so many businesses to survive . Thank you everybody, that's the end of our agenda.",149,,
1351,0.97,9554.945,9568.825,"If there's nothing else this concludes the February 1ST 2022 meeting of the Seattle public utilities Committee, we are adjourned.",149,,
1352,0.97,9568.825,9576.767,Thank you.,149,,
1353,0.97,9576.767,9579.469,& GT;,150,,
