12,0.97,241.007,254.554,"I have received a number of Emails from family members at Lifecare and I want to apologize to all of them I haven't had time to return those Emails personally come although I very much would have liked to pick I understand that they are very concerned, and rightly so, about the health of their loved ones in the facility . and I want them to know that I am as well.",0,,
13,0.97,254.621,269.068,"And that we are doing everything possible to make sure the facility gets any staff, any training and any assistance that they require to make sure that their loved ones in that facility get the best possible care.",0,,
14,0.97,269.135,296.496,"We are planning to develop a team to make sure everyone in that facility can be tested for Covid-19, but I want the families to understand that the care that they receive is not dependent on the results of their test remember, there is no specific treatment for this disease but there is no preventive measure . whether or not they test positive or negative they will still go to a Healthcare facility if they require to go to a Healthcare facility because of their medical condition.",0,,
15,0.97,296.562,308.508,"It's good for us to know, but at this point we assume that if someone is in that facility they likely have been infected or error at high risk for infection and they are being managed as if they are.",0,,
16,0.97,308.574,314.781,We will continue to provide updates as we get information.,0,,
17,0.97,314.847,332.331,"I just want to remind you again that Covid-19 can causes severe disease, as we see in the context of the Lifecare outbreak, but for many of us the disease is mild and moderate but the vast majority of people do not require hospitalization.",0,,
18,0.97,332.398,333.166,"Or medical care, for that matter.",0,,
19,0.97,333.232,340.473,"We do encourage people who have mild illnesses, please don't overload our area Healthcare facilities.",0,,

23,0.97,369.001,369.902,Thank you to everyone for being here today.,0,,
24,0.97,369.969,384.751,"I want to join in expressing my deep concern for the residents of the life center and what they are expensing today and to acknowledge the families, the families who have lost loved ones, the families who are concerned for the loved ones who are there at the facility.",0,,
25,0.97,384.817,391.758,And to those who are recovering our community stands with you in these difficult times.,0,,
26,0.97,391.824,393.793,This is a shifting landscape.,0,,
27,0.97,393.86,396.496,Really shifting by the hour.,0,,
28,0.97,396.562,408.04,And as this outbreak progresses public health leaders and policymakers must adapt and establish new sets of expectations and recommendations.,0,,
29,0.97,408.107,418.05,We have multiple objectives . We are determined to slow the spread of this virus in the community.,0,,
30,0.97,418.117,421.921,We are determined to protect those who are most vulnerable.,0,,
31,0.97,421.988,425.825,"Our older residents, those with compromised immune systems and others.",0,,
32,0.97,425.892,428.494,And in doing those things we also want to protect our economy.,0,,
33,0.97,428.561,448.214,"To make sure that we are able to continue to have people be employed, to have people be able to work the reality is this, the more we slow down the spread of this virus, the more we slow down the disease the greater the chances of keeping people healthy, of saving lives.",0,,
34,0.97,448.281,483.783,"As such, we are recommending, though to be clear, we are not requiring or mandating additional steps to minimize this outbreak . for older people, which my staff and public health has defined as people over 60 with underlying health conditions I think that is going to be something that is considered on a case-by-case basis, and for those who are pregnant we are recommending that you stay home and avoid large gatherings as much as possible.",0,,
35,0.97,483.85,495.895,We are encouraging employers to maximize Telecommuting and to make it possible for employees who can't work from home to do so.,0,,
36,0.97,495.962,501.133,Community groups should avoid creating large gatherings.,0,,
37,0.97,501.2,507.206,And the rule of thumb that public health is recommending is gatherings of more than 10 people.,0,,
38,0.97,507.273,512.511,"Again, you're going to hear this often from us those who are sick must stay home.",0,,
39,0.97,512.578,513.379,Please stay home.,0,,
40,0.97,513.446,525.491,"And if you are ill please call your doctor's office, don't go in and expose others, don't go in and overwhelm the medical system.",0,,
41,0.97,525.558,533.933,Public health director Patty Hayes will soon explain public health is not making a recommendation to close schools.,0,,
42,0.97,534.0,537.036,That's a question that comes up often.,0,,
43,0.97,537.103,543.042,"As an employer at a regional government, King County is following these recommendations ourselves.",0,,
44,0.97,543.109,557.99,We are putting them into practice . All nonessential King County convened large group meetings will be canceled for the next three weeks were through the end of March.,0,,
45,0.97,558.057,565.031,We're going to reassess that decision as we move forward.,0,,
46,0.97,565.097,569.168,Employees who can Telecommute are going to be encouraged to do so.,0,,
47,0.97,569.235,582.848,We are going to plan to do this for the coming three weeks but I'm going to have us reassess at the end of each week to determine whether our measures need to be readjusted.,0,,
48,0.97,582.915,595.361,"We want to make sure that we are doing the right thing, both to protect employees from becoming ill and to ensure that services are continuing to flow to the public.",0,,
49,0.97,595.428,595.962,We have a diverse workforce.,0,,
50,0.97,596.028,610.142,Many of our dedicated public servants must report for work in person brick Telecommuting is not an option pick they serve our public directly . Let me give the example of bus drivers.,0,,
51,0.97,610.209,614.213,"This, of course, RAISES equity issues within our workforce.",0,,
52,0.97,614.28,617.783,That is a reality that we had other employers are going to have to wrestle with.,0,,
53,0.97,617.85,632.732,"We are committed to making sure that those employees who are reporting in person for work can stay safe, can stay healthy, and can stay on the job serving the public.",0,,
54,0.97,632.798,641.24,"As you know, we're continuing to site facilities for isolation and treatment of those who have been exposed to the virus.",0,,
55,0.97,641.307,651.35,We have placed modular units near white center . and we chose that location because we own the land . The site has access to utilities.,0,,
56,0.97,651.417,657.656,And with the emergency waiver I have signed we can expedite construction.,0,,
57,0.97,657.723,664.463,I understand the community has questions them as will all communities we are answering those questions.,0,,
58,0.97,664.53,670.77,"I want to be clear, we must move quickly move quickly to stay ahead of this outbreak.",0,,
59,0.97,670.836,684.083,Every location that we select will be set up and staffed and monitored appropriately and we are seeking additional locations wherever available throughout all of King County.,0,,
60,0.97,684.15,696.862,At this time I can announce that we have secured two additional locations for modular units . one at Interbay and one in North Seattle.,0,,
61,0.97,696.929,709.909,We have finalize the purchase of the motel I mentioned a couple of days ago . that is located in Kent . We are working with the community and hope to have it operational within days.,0,,
62,0.97,709.975,722.621,"For those of you who are interested, our communications folks have the address of that facility and they're going to be offering a tour of it this afternoon.",0,,
63,0.97,722.688,726.225,These are stressful times.,0,,
64,0.97,726.292,732.731,This virus will test our resiliency it will test our compassion and our ability to look out for one another.,0,,
65,0.97,732.798,742.975,"We are answering thousands of questions per questions from media, questions from community members, from businesses, from other governments.",0,,
66,0.97,743.042,755.521,"At the same time, this situation requires us to act with urgency . We all need to be in this together.",0,,
67,0.97,755.588,761.827,People from across the region have reached out asking what they can do to help it has been immensely gratifying.,0,,
68,0.97,761.894,771.971,We are coping with the most serious outbreak of Covid-19 anywhere in the nation for our actions are forming the model that will be followed in other parts of the country.,0,,
69,0.97,772.037,789.088,"We will get through this our entire government, particularly the scientists in public health leaders working around the clock day after day are committed to returning our community to normal as quickly as possible.",0,,
70,0.97,789.155,795.394,"I would like to introduce to you the director of public health Seattle and King County, Patty Hayes.",0,,
71,0.97,795.461,798.197,Thank you.,0,,
72,0.97,798.264,819.785,I want to start by echoing what Dr. Jensen and executive Constantine have said about how we are approaching this novel virus and its risk to the public . Our deep concern for the situation at Lifecare in the community as a whole as we face this unprecedented challenge.,0,,
73,0.97,819.852,830.029,Your cooperation and your patience are vital to the communities success and ability to stop the spread of Covid-19.,0,,
74,0.97,830.095,850.349,Today public health Seattle King County is taking Proactive steps to protect the health of our community by making these recommendations as you have heard they are meant to slow the spread of novel Corona virus in our community and reduce the number of people infected.,0,,
75,0.97,850.416,857.957,First on my mind is always our entire community as public health.,0,,
76,0.97,858.023,893.292,"I think that all committees, all communities needs and knowing what is happening with this virus my mind in concern goes, specifically, to the stress on the Healthcare system and the providers that are working in the field right now, our first responders . It's under incredible stress right now as we work to plan, coordinate and assist those who are in need right now.",0,,
77,0.97,893.359,912.478,"As you have heard, this distancing measures that we are recommending are essential, because we need to slow the spread of disease to the point where our Healthcare system can continue to be able to handle the load.",0,,
78,0.97,912.544,925.424,"We do not want the situation that has been seen in other areas, in other countries where the Healthcare system is overloaded and unable to cope.",0,,
79,0.97,925.491,942.041,"The measures that I am talking to you about today work to achieve that but as executive Constantine said, we will be assessing this every day, actually, in my job and we will be meeting with the executive on a regular basis.",0,,
80,0.97,942.107,952.518,"A second reason we are doing this Relatesto the potential, even if it's a small potential, to prevent the outbreak from spreading and growing.",0,,
81,0.97,952.584,961.026,It is a new virus and I have been telling people to talk to their neighbors who have questions about that but I get the question what is different from this and the flu?,0,,
82,0.97,961.093,964.163,I go back to what we talked to you about before.,0,,
83,0.97,964.229,965.864,There are three things.,0,,
84,0.97,965.931,970.869,"Number one, it's a new virus there is no immunity to that.",0,,
85,0.97,970.936,978.977,We must be looking at those things that we can do with that in mind that people are faced without immunity.,0,,
86,0.97,979.044,988.287,"We know that 80% of people will not have serious issues and it can be handled and maybe sick at home, but will be okay.",0,,
87,0.97,988.354,998.897,"It is that 20% that can get severe illness where we want to do these measures, so that we are protecting everybody.",0,,
88,0.97,998.964,1000.899,"Secondly, there is no treatment for this virus right now.",0,,
89,0.97,1000.966,1019.918,"As you heard Dr. Newton say, regardless of what the test shows the treatment right now is what we would normally do for somebody who is having these Flulike, pneumonia like, and severe lung infections.",0,,
90,0.97,1019.985,1024.757,I know there are people who are working very hard on treatment and I applaud them.,0,,
91,0.97,1024.823,1028.927,"That is happening locally, nationally, and around the world.",0,,
92,0.97,1028.994,1031.196,"Thirdly, there is no Demonization, no vaccine for this.",0,,
93,0.97,1031.263,1041.24,That is again being scientifically driven as quickly as possible for right now my job is to recommend the best we can do to protect our community now.,0,,
94,0.97,1041.306,1056.121,"Specifically, we understand that the actions have a tremendous impact and so we are starting with those things that we are recommending, not mandating but I want to emphasize that.",0,,
95,0.97,1056.188,1068.133,"First, for vulnerable people let me repeat that people who are at higher risk of severe illness should try to stay home and away from large groups as much as possible.",0,,
96,0.97,1068.2,1076.742,Including public places and where lots of people gather.,0,,
97,0.97,1076.809,1083.882,"For workplaces, as the executive mentioned, we are recommending that workplaces take steps that enable people who can work from home to do so.",0,,
98,0.97,1083.949,1095.961,Taking these measures can help reduce the number of workers who come into contact with Covid-19 and help minimize absenteeism due to illness.,0,,
99,0.97,1096.028,1104.57,Employers should maximize Telecommuting . for as many employees as possible.,0,,
100,0.97,1104.636,1110.209,Employers should urge employees to stay home when they are sick but I can't emphasize that enough.,0,,
101,0.97,1110.275,1115.747,Sometimes we are our own worst when we are sick and we come to work.,0,,
102,0.97,1115.814,1118.617,Aren't we?,0,,
103,0.97,1118.684,1122.688,We need to support each other for when we are sick we stay home.,0,,
104,0.97,1122.754,1127.693,I have also encouraged employers to start staggering start and end times.,0,,
105,0.97,1127.759,1133.832,That reduces the large number of people coming in and out at the same time on our mass transit.,0,,
106,0.97,1133.899,1140.873,I have even noticed a difference on I-Five cents we started Messaging you.,0,,
107,0.97,1140.939,1162.661,"I don't know if any of you have, but regarding events and community gatherings, if you can Feasibly avoid large groups of people together consider postponing those meetings . We are talking to Community-Based organizations, we're talking to employers and we are talking to our groups who are coming and want to come to Seattle.",0,,
108,0.97,1162.728,1171.67,We are asking all of our residents to take these steps and slow the spread let me talk specifically about schools.,0,,
109,0.97,1171.737,1184.95,We are in dynamic conversations with schools on a daily basis public health is not recommending closing schools at this time . unless there has been a confirmed case within that school.,0,,
110,0.97,1185.017,1195.661,"The reason we are not recommending school closures is because children have not been shown to be a high risk group, which can be so much different than what we expect.",0,,
111,0.97,1195.727,1206.605,"For other illnesses . children who have compromised immune systems are, of course, in that other category that we need to be very careful with.",0,,
112,0.97,1206.672,1223.221,We respect every schools individual decision about closure or postponement of activities . As each school knows the needs of their community and is talking to their parents and their community lifetime.,0,,
113,0.97,1223.288,1234.032,"As I said, if there is a confirmed case in the school public health will work with that particular school and the district to determine what measures are best to protect.",0,,
114,0.97,1234.099,1246.645,This could include the closure and we will determine with that school the number of days and when reopening would occur.,0,,
115,0.97,1246.712,1247.946,Schools are doing the important work of educating our children.,0,,
116,0.97,1248.013,1254.019,We don't want to disrupt that unless we know Corona virus exposure risks are there.,0,,
117,0.97,1254.086,1269.668,"In addition to schools closing that can be disruptive and costly for families, we know that as we are looking at this we are assessing the potential benefits and the negative consequences of closures.",0,,
118,0.97,1269.735,1273.872,We are learning from other experiences elsewhere.,0,,
119,0.97,1273.939,1280.345,Because we know when schools are closed children go other places.,0,,
120,0.97,1280.412,1286.284,And we need to be mindful of that.,0,,
121,0.97,1286.351,1291.289,Oral hygiene we have talked to you about in the last number of press coverage is and remains a key strategy.,0,,
122,0.97,1291.356,1314.312,"Have you heard executive Constantine and Dr. Nguyen say, please, if you are not feeling well if your home and your ill call your Healthcare provider before you show up . We are talking to those Healthcare providers about helping people on the phone and be screened to so we don't crowd the rooms at the clinics.",0,,
123,0.97,1314.379,1325.857,Some are already working on all this.,0,,
124,0.97,1325.924,1326.725,"As I said, we are seeing fewer cars.",0,,
125,0.97,1326.792,1335.333,"As reported in the news, event that Amazon and Microsoft have been turned into Online meetings.",0,,
126,0.97,1335.4,1338.437,We have noted that some religious services have either been postponed or they are being done in a different way.,0,,
127,0.97,1338.503,1351.516,"I see that people are shaking hands less and doing the elbow bump the things we are asking people to do are definitely different, but they are doable.",0,,
128,0.97,1351.583,1365.464,"You know, we as public health officials weigh the potential benefits for the community along with the significant impacts in these recommendations on our community and the impacts are weighed with our elected officials.",0,,
129,0.97,1365.53,1378.777,In consultation with the CDC we developed these Recognitions best on the rising number of cases we have in our community and the importance of taking these actions now to further reduce transmission.,0,,
130,0.97,1378.844,1384.649,I want to emphasize again the importance for all of us to do our part during this outbreak.,0,,
131,0.97,1384.716,1397.195,"And now I would like to introduce Dr. Kathy Wilkie, our state health director.",0,,
132,0.97,1397.262,1397.796,"Good afternoon, everyone.",0,,
133,0.97,1397.863,1406.905,I'm going to quickly give you a brief update on the statewide Covid-19 situation and then I'm going to also give you a brief update on testing capacity here in our state.,0,,
134,0.97,1406.972,1421.987,"So, as of midnight last night there had been a total of 39 individuals diagnosed with Covid-19 in our state this includes 31 King County residents and eight Snohomish County residents.",0,,
135,0.97,1422.053,1438.637,That total number of 39 individuals also includes 10 deaths . Nine of the individuals who have died our King County residents and one is a Snohomish County resident.,0,,
136,0.97,1438.703,1448.013,Now I'm going to turn to give you a brief update about testing capacity.,0,,
137,0.97,1448.079,1451.216,"We know that, first of all, we know that there is a huge demand out there for testing.",0,,
138,0.97,1451.283,1459.257,There are lots of people in our state who are sick and they want to know whether they have Covid-19 and they want to get tested.,0,,
139,0.97,1459.324,1472.07,I want to tell you that we are doing everything possible to quickly expand testing capacity here in our States that there are a few things that have happened over the last 24 hours.,0,,
140,0.97,1472.137,1482.047,"First of all, many of you may have heard that the Federal Government relaxed the criteria for who can be tested with the CDC Covid-19 assay.",0,,
141,0.97,1482.113,1492.858,"This was great news . and, basically, now anyone who has symptoms that may be consistent with Covid-19 infection can be tested.",0,,
142,0.97,1492.924,1500.599,We are working really hard in Washington to increase the testing capacity.,0,,
143,0.97,1500.665,1516.982,"As I have told you before, the public health laboratory in shoreline has the capacity now to test about 100 people per day or 200 specimens . each individual, generally, cements two specimens.",0,,
144,0.97,1517.048,1517.849,And we are Ramping up this capacity.,0,,
145,0.97,1517.916,1521.586,We have purchased equipment.,0,,
