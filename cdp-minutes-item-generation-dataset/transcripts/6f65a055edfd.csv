70,0.97,421.854,435.435,These are not expected to be controversial and improving them will complete batch 4A of the legacy a retroactive Technologies we have been reviewing and improving during the past year.,21,,
71,0.97,435.435,439.739,This past weekend was the 20th anniversary of the attacks from September 11th.,21,,
72,0.97,439.739,442.475,This is our first public meeting since that anniversary.,21,,
73,0.97,442.475,459.125,"I just wanted to take a moment to remember the thousands of innocent people who were killed and to thank all the first responders who risked and gave their lives in this attack on September 11, 2001.",21,,
74,0.97,459.125,459.392,Thank you.,21,,
75,0.97,459.392,469.969,I wanted to thank the officers who apprehended a suspect whose speeding vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian.,21,,
76,0.97,469.969,476.642,The detectives at SPD will investigate this hit-and-run drunk driving Homicide case as best they can.,21,,
77,0.97,476.642,499.765,"This is--when I talk about the staffing shortage at SPD, want to acknowledge Op-Ed published which RAISES concerns about how the--of police officers is Impacting the operations of our city's harbor patrol to address the high levels throughout Department including loss of detectives.",21,,
78,0.97,499.765,509.575,This past Friday my office and central staff circulated an amendment to Council bill 120112 the midyear budget supplemental which passed on August 17th.,21,,
79,0.97,509.575,519.018,I'm not a member of the Finance Committee and central staff and I needed to pass after our Recess to craft this amendment and get it approved.,21,,
80,0.97,519.018,520.152,There are two options.,21,,
81,0.97,520.152,525.791,Option a would keep $3 million within SPD's budget for recruitment and retention.,21,,
82,0.97,525.791,538.137,Option B is a more modest version that will take an Unallocated $1.1 million and dedicate for it recruitment and retention.,21,,
83,0.97,538.137,539.805,I also circulated it Friday.,21,,
84,0.97,539.805,569.101,I was not able to get that authorize and legislation on to the referral calendar so per our Council rules my other opportunities to ask the majority view to add it to the referral calendar--[Indiscernible] I also want to talk about the amendments to the budget bill.,21,,
85,0.97,569.101,577.843,This would allocate funds to recruit and retain SPD personnel because we have lost 300 officers and detectives over the past 18 months.,21,,
86,0.97,577.843,585.818,"While we have hired 100 for a net loss of 200, the 200 figure is still very high.",21,,
87,0.97,585.818,589.589,Newly hired officers need substantial time for training.,21,,
88,0.97,589.589,597.73,It is more effective and efficient simply to retain city government front line workers we already have.,21,,
89,0.97,597.73,613.212,The modest amounts would go beyond mere words to demonstrate we recognize the staffing crisis caused by the title wave and that we want the remaining officers and detectives to remain the Seattle.,21,,
90,0.97,613.212,620.252,We can take swift action this week to reduce the amount of time Seattle residents wait for an officer after calling 911.,21,,
91,0.97,620.252,632.832,I know there is likely to be disagreement about this approach but I wanted to get these proposals on to the table so we have the opportunity to discuss and decide these.,21,,
92,0.97,632.832,637.136,I will just a couple of over items here.,21,,
93,0.97,637.136,646.112,There was an important yet critical Op-Ed published in the Seattle times last Friday raising environmental concerns ant the future of the river clean up.,21,,
94,0.97,646.112,652.418,I want to thank community leaders for raising this issue.,21,,
95,0.97,652.418,659.792,"The on going decades long clean up of the river includes County, the port, the city, the EPA and many others.",21,,
96,0.97,659.792,667.199,I understand Seattle public utilities has been in communication with the writers of the Op-Ed.,21,,
97,0.97,667.199,685.851,"Spu leadership has reaffirmed they value this input, they are committed to working in partnership with the river clean up coalition to reach a common goal of Righting this historical wrong.",21,,
98,0.97,685.851,700.933,Spu staff has assured me that EPA's anticipated proposal for the East water way clean up which is just that portion of the river east of harbor Island will clean the East water way to the highest level that is technically and scientifically feasible and sustainable.,21,,
99,0.97,700.933,706.539,That is the same level that is technically feasible for other portions of the river.,21,,
100,0.97,706.539,721.687,I've asked staff to continue their open line of communication with the Drcc and to come to our committee December 1ST to provide an update on the river clean up which again involves multiple parties but Spu can give us an over view.,21,,
101,0.97,721.687,725.357,We ask them questions about what is going on at that point.,21,,
102,0.97,725.357,734.633,On a lighter NOTE this past weekend I attended the first performances of the summer outdoor series.,21,,
103,0.97,734.633,738.437,Everyone is welcomed to attend every Wednesday evening in September starting at 6:30 P.M.,21,,
104,0.97,738.437,751.317,It is in the heart of the U district just below 43rd Street which is where one of the new light rail stations will be opening in only 19 days.,21,,
105,0.97,751.317,752.151,That concludes my report.,21,,
106,0.97,752.151,752.485,Thank you.,21,,
107,0.97,752.485,756.088,"Thank you so much, council member Pedersen.",22,,

116,0.97,782.047,782.381,Good morning.,22,,
117,0.97,782.381,789.321,Council member Strauss may have frozen.,23,,
118,0.97,789.321,794.393,Council Strauss are you ready to go now while we get Council member Sawant back?,23,,

120,0.97,795.161,798.464,Thank you so much.,25,,
121,0.97,798.464,800.166,I appreciate it.,25,,
122,0.97,800.166,800.499,There she is.,25,,
123,0.97,800.499,800.933,Are you back?,25,,
124,0.97,800.933,801.5,Yes.,26,,
125,0.97,801.5,804.904,I don't know why I got kicked out of zoom.,26,,
126,0.97,804.904,807.54,We will have Council member Strauss pitch for it you.,27,,
127,0.97,807.54,813.512,Since you are back if you are ready to go we will hand it over to you.,27,,
128,0.97,813.512,814.914,That is fine.,28,,
129,0.97,814.914,815.648,Thank you.,28,,
130,0.97,815.648,816.282,Good morning everyone.,28,,
131,0.97,816.282,822.087,There are no items on today's city council agenda from the committee.,28,,
132,0.97,822.087,828.594,The next two meetings are scheduled for next week September 21st and September 23rd.,28,,
133,0.97,828.594,844.176,Those committee meetings will give the committee members the opportunity to vote ton Renter's rights Leng isolation my office has drafted.,28,,
134,0.97,844.176,854.253,According to the Apartmentlist Apartmentlist.Com rent in Seattle has risen more than 25% this year line.,28,,
135,0.97,854.253,871.437,Thousands will become homeless while tens of thousands of others will remain housed but very precariously and only at the cost falling deeper and deeper into debt to the fore profit rental housing market.,28,,
136,0.97,871.437,905.971,25% rent increases are Unconsciousable in any period but especially in the midst of these crisis and clearly Seattle needs rent control which is why my office along side Renter's rights organization has prepared rent control legislation that I've mentioned in the past briefings that if passed will go into effect the moment state legislators end the unjust 40 year ban on any regulation of rent and if this city council does pass rent control the Democrats in Lik will no longer be able to ignore their rent control ban.,28,,
137,0.97,905.971,910.776,And support for rent control is enormous.,28,,
138,0.97,910.776,918.717,In fact my office and my organization--and many Renter's rights advocates have been talking about rent control for well over three years now.,28,,
139,0.97,918.717,923.022,I've never seen the support as high as it is right now.,28,,
140,0.97,923.022,936.802,"While rent control is what we--ultimately need, my office has also prepared two other bills to mitigate the damage done to Renters by skyrocketing rents.",28,,
141,0.97,936.802,958.991,"We have the bill recommended by the Commission to require six months notice for rent increases allowing tenants the time they need to rearrange their lives to find other housing if a rent increase is so much they cannot afford it and are forced to move because of that rent increase, not because of other reasons.",28,,
142,0.97,958.991,971.57,We also have the bill requiring landlords to pay relocation assistance if an outrageously large rent increase forces Renters to move which is on today's introduction and referral calendar.,28,,
143,0.97,971.57,983.048,Both of these bills have been discussed at length in the committee for the past several months and I know a committee members have engaged in that discussion and I've asked very important questions.,28,,
144,0.97,983.048,992.458,I appreciate that and I appreciate city council for being there in providing responses.,28,,
145,0.97,992.458,1001.233,So I think we have had a lot of discussion on both the bills and my office intends to bring them for a vote in the committee next week.,28,,
146,0.97,1001.233,1006.472,Ideally we will vote them out of committee at the September 21st committee meeting.,28,,
147,0.97,1006.472,1011.276,However if committee members are not prepared to vote we will vote at the next meeting on the 23rd instead.,28,,
148,0.97,1011.276,1018.017,Either way we will vote on those bills out of committee before the budget begins on the 27th.,28,,
149,0.97,1018.017,1036.435,As I also mentioned in the past there is another bill that my office is developing with the help of city council staff as part of the Sustainability and Renter right's committee work to support the stop the pipeline movement and to instead support the green new deal.,28,,
150,0.97,1036.435,1047.513,This bill will give the green new deal over sight vote the power the newly formed over sight board which is very important.,28,,
151,0.97,1047.513,1074.573,This bill would give that vote the power to rate financial institutions and insurance companies that the city is considering contracting based on whether those companies are investing in or ensuring fossil fuel infrastructure projects and will require the city of Seattle's Finance and administrative services Department to consider those Rankings when selecting what Companyless the city of Seattle should do business with.,28,,
152,0.97,1074.573,1099.364,Finally Council members will have seen an amendment that my staff just sent to you all to the budget that my office intends to move at today's city council meeting to cut $2.41 million in the Seattle police Department and add those $2.41 million to the supporting save communities fund in the human services Department.,28,,
153,0.97,1099.364,1124.089,Last November the city council placed on $7.5 million in the police budget for this year in response to the demands from the justice for George Floyd movement to reduce the already--[Indiscernible] and to instead put those funds in building and supporting communities.,28,,
154,0.97,1124.089,1134.7,It was frankly the least the establishment could have done given the power of the movement and the fact these were the fines the police did not even need in order to fund their own staffing plans.,28,,
155,0.97,1134.7,1151.016,Unfortunately but not surprisingly now that the movement is in the streets has waned the bulk of the city council is--the establishment is rapidly moving to walk back all those commitments made at the movement's height last year.,28,,
156,0.97,1151.016,1166.331,This supplemental budget removes--them freeing up an additional $7.5 million in the police budget and only transferring part of those funds to other departments.,28,,
157,0.97,1166.331,1180.913,This is in response to the request from the activists with the Decriminalize Seattle to transfer the police salary savings into community funds as Council members committed to do last November.,28,,
158,0.97,1180.913,1186.118,I hope Council members will support this amendment.,28,,
159,0.97,1186.118,1186.385,Thank you.,28,,
160,0.97,1186.385,1189.454,Thank you so much Council member Sawant.,29,,
161,0.97,1189.454,1195.661,Are there any comments or questions on that report?,29,,
162,0.97,1195.661,1195.928,All right.,29,,
163,0.97,1195.928,1198.13,Hearing none I think we will go down the line.,29,,
164,0.97,1198.13,1203.235,Next up is Council member Strauss and then after Council member Strauss will be Council member Herbold.,29,,
165,0.97,1203.235,1205.737,Good morning council member Strauss.,29,,
166,0.97,1205.737,1206.204,Thank you.,30,,

226,0.97,1635.7,1641.539,Glad to be with everybody today after the break.,32,,
227,0.97,1641.539,1645.076,I hope everybody is feeling Recharged.,32,,
228,0.97,1645.076,1674.639,So items on full council agenda today there are no items from the public safety and human services Committee on the full council agenda today but there is an amendment that--I am going to be proposing to legislation that has already gone through Council member Mosqueda's Finance and budget committee.,32,,
229,0.97,1674.639,1676.408,It is a technical amendment.,32,,
230,0.97,1676.408,1684.516,It basically moves the authority within the police Department budget Summery levels.,32,,
231,0.97,1684.516,1715.78,They are described in the legislation that Council---Er to Committee voted on within--within another amendment within the--amendment four that--I'm sorry the amendment 8 that we acted on in committee last week.,32,,
232,0.97,1715.78,1728.393,The amendment last week funds a number of different priorities both within the Seattle Department and outside of it and again amendment 1 is just a technical amendment.,32,,
233,0.97,1728.393,1748.012,"And then addition to that member Mosqueda and I have another point amendment shifts $700,000 of authority for the--for the proposed triage team from the center.",32,,
234,0.97,1748.012,1789.654,"Imposes a restricting the expenditure of the funds until the executive provides a report Council detailing how and when the executive will do the response protocol for the try angle team, the response protocol is also funded with this legislation and must come--the response protocol must be acquired, purchased and--used to train Dispatchers prior to the implementation of the funding associated with developing hiring implementing.",32,,
235,0.97,1789.654,1799.297,"So, there is another amendment that I've been working with central staff on that may be ready in time for full council today.",32,,
236,0.97,1799.297,1805.436,Just wanted to give this opportunity to flag it in case we are already to pull together.,32,,
237,0.97,1805.436,1829.46,I think folks are aware that a shift of officers do a different--a different shift structure for ten hour shifts has been long desired by the Seattle police Department.,32,,
238,0.97,1829.46,1839.103,It was identified a as priority in the 2018 hiring retention report that the s--that the police Department pulled together.,32,,
239,0.97,1839.103,1857.655,I have been told in the past that in order to move to that shift structure for tens it might necessitate an additional police shift and that potentially would have cost.,32,,
240,0.97,1857.655,1919.05,This particular budget legislation might be a way for us to signal that we are entrusted in showing support by making funding available with the understanding that--a change in shifts to four tens would absolutely necessitate--necessitate bargaining with the Union but I just want to flag this that this might be something that we are coming forward with today because I do think it is important to--to act on the--the recommendations coming out of that several years old now hiring and retention study with the understanding that our ability to act is very limited because this--as I mentioned does require bargaining and we haven't had the opportunity to bargain since those recommendations have been made.,32,,
241,0.97,1919.05,1934.065,I do think that--air marking these dollars pending bargaining--pending a bargaining outcome would send a really important and useful signal about our support for this effort.,32,,
242,0.97,1934.065,1937.168,"Moving on, I do have committee today, tomorrow at 9:30.",32,,
243,0.97,1937.168,1940.071,That is the public safety and human services committee.,32,,

245,0.97,1962.293,1972.67,As background Council requested this as a legislative intent.,32,,
246,0.97,1972.67,1988.152,The--the--the they will be joining us to provide those Reck recommendations associated with that work.,32,,
247,0.97,1988.152,1994.258,"Further, legislation will be heard in committee tomorrow.",32,,
248,0.97,1994.258,2017.181,I will likely have an amendment to this bill to--make sure that the ordinance is enforceable by make it possible for the city to verify status of certain governments.,32,,
249,0.97,2017.181,2032.163,The current definitions do not make it possible for the--the definitions to be verified which then in turn will make the--legislation Unenforceable by SPD.,32,,
250,0.97,2032.163,2045.977,We will also be hearing a presentation from the human service Department lead and reach and response another legislative intent.,32,,
251,0.97,2045.977,2055.586,His examines the expected level of priority referrals to Prearrest diversion services and cost estimates of those accepting referrals over the next several years.,32,,

254,0.97,2074.939,2099.363,This is just a check in of where we are at on the--stake holder conversations that we have been having for several months now on--on different components of this legislation and an opportunity to sort of discuss where we are at given I think we probably had ten meetings over the last several months.,32,,
255,0.97,2099.363,2101.232,There is more to be done.,32,,
256,0.97,2101.232,2115.112,I want to shift now away from the committee updates to just give some highlights from some of the departments in my committee portfolio from Hsd.,32,,

366,0.97,2935.098,2957.621,The reason for that decision is there is an existing contract in Opcd for the chief Seattle Club and it would be more efficient to take the money we want to give to chief Seattle Club and put it through that existing contract rather than have Hsd create an tend to some separate contract.,41,,

421,0.97,3275.639,3280.143,Hope everybody got a break.,63,,
422,0.97,3280.143,3284.881,There are no agenda items on today's full council agenda.,63,,
423,0.97,3284.881,3295.925,We did have a meeting on September 8th where we held a public hearing on the creation of a new business improvement area on 15th Avenue East.,63,,
424,0.97,3295.925,3305.101,Proponents did submit by Tises from 73% of businesses in the area and there were no petition Refusals.,63,,
425,0.97,3305.101,3315.111,We kid hear from a few businesses who were--who raised some concerns.,63,,
426,0.97,3315.111,3320.85,We will be discussing the Bia again in the next Committee on September 21st.,63,,
427,0.97,3320.85,3332.329,At that time I do plan to bring an amendment to include a focus on representation from tenants to be included on the board.,63,,
428,0.97,3332.329,3340.136,That second hearing will be on September 21st.,63,,
429,0.97,3340.136,3349.979,"I was interested to learn that the Mayor has decided to appoint a second interim director, different interim director to the office of arts and cultures.",63,,
430,0.97,3349.979,3360.223,My understanding is no one on the arts Commission or within the arts community was consulted or--included in that discussion.,63,,
431,0.97,3360.223,3373.303,I will say I understand that it is the Mayor's prerogative to make such an appointment but I have been taxed by many other community members who are very frustrated by the lack of inclusion in the process.,63,,
432,0.97,3373.303,3399.829,I say that because as we work towards recovery and--dealing with the funding that is coming trying to put that money out the door will be really important we maintain the very good relationships we have with the arts community and the arts sector and make sure those folks are--that we are including those who are most directly impacted by the work of the office of arts and culture.,63,,
433,0.97,3399.829,3403.299,So I--hope that that will continue in the future.,63,,
434,0.97,3403.299,3407.67,There has been a lot of important community building done.,63,,
435,0.97,3407.67,3415.545,We just recently passed the cultural space PDA and there was a lot of work associated with that that needs to be implemented still.,63,,
436,0.97,3415.545,3419.549,That all will happen because of the relationships with communities.,63,,
437,0.97,3419.549,3423.92,I want to make sure those relationships are well maintained.,63,,
438,0.97,3423.92,3439.602,Last week I met with the beacon Hill Council to discuss and hear from neighbors about Anti-Displacement and Anti-Gentrification strategies they have as we look ahead to updating the plan.,63,,
439,0.97,3439.602,3454.717,"I also met with staff to Hearne about plans they had to ensure that there is a mitigation strategies in the East African community, particularly in the South end and to learn about youth empowerment work they are doing.",63,,
440,0.97,3454.717,3462.125,I was briefed by Seattle public utilities.,63,,
441,0.97,3462.125,3469.365,It caused some--troubling odors in the area for neighbors in Georgetown.,63,,
442,0.97,3469.365,3470.166,Everything is back to normal.,63,,
443,0.97,3470.166,3478.208,The situation has led me to question how we can better communicate with the county on these sorts of issues.,63,,
444,0.97,3478.208,3496.025,County actually issues the permits and is responsible for enforcement so we want to make Úsure that we are able to better keep track of businesses and people who violate our Environmental protection laws and what penalties we can deliver those who have violated these protections.,63,,
445,0.97,3496.025,3508.404,As said everything has been restored and there wasn't any imminent danger but it is still important for us to be in closer communication with the county when things like this happen.,63,,
446,0.97,3508.404,3515.478,This weekly be back at the farmer's market.,63,,
447,0.97,3515.478,3525.255,I will not be holding virtual office hours on Thursday cause I will be out.,63,,
448,0.97,3525.255,3528.625,This Friday I will be joined by the Mayor.,63,,
449,0.97,3528.625,3532.695,The community members from the neighborhood are hosting a tour.,63,,
450,0.97,3532.695,3536.032,I've been talking about issues in the neighborhood for a long time now.,63,,
451,0.97,3536.032,3547.744,They are looking for safety improvements and for improvements in the lives of neighbors living Unhoused in the immediate area.,63,,
452,0.97,3547.744,3553.149,This is third or fourth tour I've been on in the past year.,63,,
453,0.97,3553.149,3562.492,Previously we went out with homelessness service providers.,63,,
454,0.97,3562.492,3580.109,Drz [Indiscernible] so in our on going conversations with office of housing out particularly at Mount Baker we were able to amplify the community's wish to turn a vacant parking lot on the farmer site.,63,,
455,0.97,3580.109,3586.616,It has been used for some drug related activity.,63,,
456,0.97,3586.616,3603.366,We have also worked with neighbors and with sound trance it to get some commitments for better lighting under the station platform.,63,,
457,0.97,3603.366,3626.456,We haven't got very far in that particular request yet but that continues to be a priority and I think will be an important shift for sound transit to consider as we know other stations might be going out with an elevated--elevated form over street level.,63,,
458,0.97,3626.456,3632.095,And honestly who of us who rides a light rail wouldn't be able to get a coffee?,63,,
459,0.97,3632.095,3635.064,So I look forward to the tour with the Mayor that will be this Friday.,63,,
460,0.97,3635.064,3640.003,I hope to see even more progress come from those conversations.,63,,
461,0.97,3640.003,3644.507,"Colleagues, that is all that I have for this morning.",63,,
462,0.97,3644.507,3645.675,Thank you so much.,64,,
463,0.97,3645.675,3652.515,I see that Council member Lewis has his hand raised.,64,,
464,0.97,3652.515,3653.483,Thank you.,65,,
465,0.97,3653.483,3669.632,I wanted to clarify what--the particular use of the vacant parking lot at Mount Baker you guys are--I'm just curious and interested if you could speak a little more to that.,65,,
466,0.97,3669.632,3695.425,"So the residents who live and work in the unit park far away and particularly at night particularly because some of them work late at night and because of the kind of activity that is happening around there, that building itself doesn't have designated parking so they are hoping to park closer to their door.",66,,
467,0.97,3695.425,3698.895,"It is a temporary parking, not the entire lot.",66,,
468,0.97,3698.895,3710.64,I think the conversation we are having is to reserve maybe ten spots so folks have a place that is closer when they are getting home.,66,,
469,0.97,3710.64,3716.579,Thank you for clarifying that.,67,,
470,0.97,3716.579,3723.219,I--really appreciate the innovation in making that request.,67,,
471,0.97,3723.219,3743.473,I had some preliminary discussions about a lot of potential interim uses to assist with mitigating the homelessness crisis several months ago with the Mayoral administration just given that it is a colossal amount of space.,67,,
472,0.97,3743.473,3747.643,It is not being utilized within a quarter mile of that site.,67,,
473,0.97,3747.643,3750.413,We have dozens of people experiencing homelessness.,67,,
474,0.97,3750.413,3756.252,"Just making a slight departure, I don't want to hold up briefing so I won't go too far into this.",67,,
475,0.97,3756.252,3771.3,When I was down--I went down Memorial day weekend to San Francisco and saw that they had a mitigation plan where there were sanction Encampsites on surplus properties.,67,,
476,0.97,3771.3,3781.244,"People could pitch a tent on a palette and it was secure, there was privacy, it was fenced in.",67,,
477,0.97,3781.244,3783.613,There were services there.,67,,
478,0.97,3783.613,3785.915,I am not endorsing necessarily sanctioned camping sites.,67,,
479,0.97,3785.915,3788.251,I'm not saying that is good.,67,,
480,0.97,3788.251,3790.219,I don't necessarily want those.,67,,
481,0.97,3790.219,3837.9,I guess what I am saying is--not taking advantage of less desirable alternatives because we don't want to Condone something that isn't as great as--that might have some kind of problem with it is endorsing a strategy where we continue to tolerate and expect our neighbors to tolerate housed and Unhoused--a primarily--[Indiscernible] I do think we need a little bit of--in scrambling to make this Cyst up more manageable and that involves using sites in creative ways like what you just proposed.,67,,
482,0.97,3837.9,3862.291,A site that is being used for nothing that is huge that we should have some kind of adapt ability about using cause otherwise we are just saying go camp in a Non-Sanctioned location and we will ignore it and act like as a result--that that is better than the potential on certainties with some of these other mitigation strategies.,67,,
483,0.97,3862.291,3864.46,So I wanted to lift that up.,67,,
484,0.97,3864.46,3865.728,I appreciate that innovation.,67,,
485,0.97,3865.728,3869.465,I stand ready to assist in anyway I can make it a reality.,67,,

498,0.97,3900.83,3904.567,I will pick up on that last conversation briefly cause that was the end of my comments.,70,,
499,0.97,3904.567,3911.374,I want to under score the importance of what Council member Lewis and Council member Morales have brought to the table yet again.,70,,
500,0.97,3911.374,3924.62,I think this Council has repeatedly not only talked about the importance of funding and investing in multiple housing strategies but we have passed legislation in partnership with the Mayor.,70,,
501,0.97,3924.62,3926.088,It has been signed into law.,70,,
502,0.97,3926.088,3934.196,As we think about new and creative more long term solutions to getting folks both into shelters and into housing we do not have the luxury.,70,,
503,0.97,3934.196,3936.799,We do not have the time.,70,,
504,0.97,3936.799,3953.983,"We need to act now to implement the language that we have already put into law that creates tiny houses, that creates Rv safe lots, that creates these immediate shelter options as we work to build additional housing and shelter model that we know are important.",70,,
505,0.97,3953.983,3956.986,This was under scored for me as well.,70,,
506,0.97,3956.986,3970.199,I wanted to call out that last week Council member Herbold and I had the chance to visit with business owners and human service providers through lead and reach.,70,,
507,0.97,3970.199,3986.515,"We had the chance to meet with Maria Jose with Bob with Cascade Columbia distribution, with my old friend Betsey from the Seattle iron and metals corporation along with lead and reach out--outreach providers.",70,,
508,0.97,3986.515,4002.732,There was five of them there that day and our friend Victoria who is a friend of the small business owners who have been trying to call attention to the need for folks in the storage down and industrial area to be able to access tiny houses and Rvs.,70,,
509,0.97,4002.732,4030.626,"We heard from small business owners that day that they want the city to move forward with the 2021 funds that have been allocated so more people have the ability to get inside whether it is Teeny houses, palette shelters, the Teeny homes model from the--group that works Oh to refurbish the old trailers that go on trucks.",70,,
510,0.97,4030.626,4033.662,"That model--if you visited, it is a great model as well.",70,,
511,0.97,4033.662,4050.679,"We have put funding forward with these authority term solutions and from the experienced housing coalition who wants there to be a tiny homes, small homes model to all of the work we know they have done.",70,,
512,0.97,4050.679,4066.195,"There is multiple strategies that cold be used with this short term funding that has also been filtered through us, to us by the state legislator and we have put it into our Seattle rescue plan bill and it has been signed into law.",70,,
513,0.97,4066.195,4069.065,Let's act now deploy the dollars we have.,70,,
514,0.97,4069.065,4082.044,We cannot expect reject dollars on the tables when we have beds.,70,,
515,0.97,4082.044,4086.615,"I will give you that new title, equitable development.",70,,
516,0.97,4086.615,4092.121,I did want to thank the small business owners for their time and the outreach workers for their time as well.,70,,
517,0.97,4092.121,4098.794,We had the chance to talk about how important it is for that outreach to be done going door to door at those Rvs.,70,,
518,0.97,4098.794,4108.471,They often see more than one person live in the Rvs.,70,,
519,0.97,4108.471,4124.386,The answer was yes and Council member Herbold did some incredible work with us as we work to create a safe float make sure folks that had an Rv had a place for storage if they were willing to accept shelter knowing their Rv would not get towed.,70,,
520,0.97,4124.386,4131.894,It was important for us to put forward both the Rv safe lot and the storage funding so that a creative alternative or solutions could be met.,70,,
521,0.97,4131.894,4132.895,That funding is in effect.,70,,
522,0.97,4132.895,4134.597,We have those dollars out there.,70,,
523,0.97,4134.597,4136.098,We just need it spent now.,70,,
524,0.97,4136.098,4150.312,I have also spent the last two to three weeks over the break talking to multiple business owners and representatives.,70,,
525,0.97,4150.312,4156.018,So I started at the end of my presentation.,70,,
526,0.97,4156.018,4174.537,I wanted to follow up on that Dissxugs let you know we had that tour and conversation in the George town area and really appreciate their time and we will continue make sure that the purple bags are being deployed and that additional outreach be a and lead continues to go out there.,70,,
527,0.97,4174.537,4177.006,We have funded that so let's get it implemented.,70,,
528,0.97,4177.006,4192.621,"Starting at the top of my script, colleagues we have items on our agenda from the housing an Finance Committee for today's full council meeting.",70,,
529,0.97,4192.621,4203.832,"The reappointment of Frank, Barbara and drew Porter for the communion roots housing.",70,,

532,0.97,4219.782,4220.683,The midyear supplemental budget.,70,,
533,0.97,4220.683,4236.498,What I didn't mention is the hazard pay legislation which I will be making a motion to push out that as well given the on going cases of Delta variant and the increased hospitalizations we don't see in this ridge John and around the country.,70,,
534,0.97,4236.498,4240.769,We will be looking to continue to expand the use of the hazard pay.,70,,
535,0.97,4240.769,4246.875,I will make more comments about that this afternoon.,70,,
536,0.97,4246.875,4250.412,We had this item on our agenda three times.,70,,
537,0.97,4250.412,4252.247,Twice in August and once in July.,70,,
538,0.97,4252.247,4261.256,I want to thank you for the robust discussion about this Mitd year supplemental--midyear supplemental.,70,,
539,0.97,4261.256,4267.563,We did get word from the Mayor's office that there was an under spend of $15 million from SPD.,70,,
540,0.97,4267.563,4279.708,We wanted to work to address that under spent where it was most appropriate to address it.,70,,
541,0.97,4279.708,4282.478,That is in the supplemental budget.,70,,
542,0.97,4282.478,4297.226,I want to thank Council member Sawant and Strauss for your amendments that are making this project be able to move forward as the Garfield super block community organizers have been calling for.,70,,
543,0.97,4297.226,4316.979,"I am also excited about the 200,000 that I'm including for building additional tiny House villages in--if many of you haven't yet visited or excuse me many of you have already visited Northwest which is a great example of where we have these tiny House villages built.",70,,
544,0.97,4316.979,4320.616,It relies on a lot of donations and volunteer time.,70,,
545,0.97,4320.616,4323.385,We are looking forward to supporting them.,70,,
546,0.97,4323.385,4334.596,I am excited as well about the funding we included in an early committee meeting to make sure there is another mental health provider for our Seattle fire Department.,70,,
547,0.97,4334.596,4342.237,As you will recall we already allocated one FTE.,70,,
548,0.97,4342.237,4362.791,"With this funding we are also making sure that there is a mental health provider located within the Seattle fire Department as well as within the trust, the member, front line members trust so there is easy access and we are breaking down all of the barriers.",70,,
549,0.97,4362.791,4375.571,I'm also edge sited about the amendment included that Council member Herbold eluded to that we have built together and that the--Finance and housing committee passed with some additional amendments to it.,70,,
550,0.97,4375.571,4398.26,The policy goals of the amendments that Council member Herbold and I worked on were to allocate the SP under spent to public safety investments some of which had been requested by the executive and also to maintain the Council's important Tants investments and commitment to Scaling up alternative responses through different programs such as in the human services Department.,70,,
551,0.97,4398.26,4417.646,"We included $3 million for the request of community to go to the Department to expand our public safety grants, to expand those from 18 months to a full two years to create true stability and the ability for those community partners to scale up to capacity.",70,,
552,0.97,4417.646,4420.949,I think package represented an important balance in that area.,70,,
553,0.97,4420.949,4443.505,If we do things like add triage 1 there also must be the ability to make sure that community safety contracts are in place to ensure there is a landing zone for social workers and case managers to bring people to so people have services and housing and additional mental and behavioral health services instead of having a triage entity call and then have fire and police called ultimately.,70,,
554,0.97,4443.505,4448.577,That is why I'm also excited about this amendment.,70,,
555,0.97,4448.577,4466.295,"Amendment number four was built after having more discussions with case stake holders including firefighters from Iff27, local 27 is supportive of creating a triage response team but also wants to make sure that there is a praise for individuals to go when a triage unit responds.",70,,
556,0.97,4466.295,4470.532,We want to make sure there is a landing zone.,70,,
557,0.97,4470.532,4487.316,"We know too many times folks are being called fire and police are being called for a lack of can pass toy bring these people to--more Oh Lis tick services like housing an community health services, behavioral and social health services.",70,,
558,0.97,4487.316,4495.557,They end up going into harbor view or sometimes--getting moved along without any additional support.,70,,
559,0.97,4495.557,4496.124,That doesn't help anything.,70,,
560,0.97,4496.124,4508.403,We wanted to make sure that in response to the direct on the ground request from firefighters who really want to make sure that the protocol is in Mace before we stand up triage 1 that we have a thought.,70,,
561,0.97,4508.403,4525.888,And complete response and at a minimum identify confirmed provider so that Menltal health and case manager pro Goingals will be able to provide shelters and medical assistance and the staffing and Quipment is fully thought through.,70,,
562,0.97,4525.888,4526.455,Really appreciate the work.,70,,
