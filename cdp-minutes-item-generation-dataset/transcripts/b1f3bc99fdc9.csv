586,0.8356165885925293,2762.0,2774.8,I did just under eight million dollars a year in revenue and to give you some context for the tax you all are talking about I had about 3.5 million dollars in payroll.,,,

592,0.829218327999115,2811.6,2817.3,And so I've been able to make about twenty percent of what I would normally make.,,,
593,0.829218327999115,2817.6,2827.0,But that also means I've laid off over 90 people and I brought four people back to work this week because pint production is going well.,,,

609,0.7281851768493652,2959.7,2965.5,I do think we need to be so careful about taxing medical research right now.,,,

953,0.8450629711151123,4993.9,4996.0, So slide for please cares.,,,
954,0.8450629711151123,4998.0,5002.7,So this is generally the general structure of the tax.,,,
955,0.8450629711151123,5004.0,5016.9,So as has been described and discussed earlier in today's meeting the tax is a 1.3 percent tax on payroll that is assigned to Seattle business.,,,
956,0.8450629711151123,5017.4,5023.5,It generally applies to businesses with 7 million dollars of annual payroll in,,,
957,0.9058784246444702,5023.7,5033.7," Prior year, there are exempt categories that I will discuss further and so one of the concepts is what is mean?",,,
958,0.9058784246444702,5033.7,5036.1,What do I mean when I say Seattle assign a payroll.,,,
959,0.9058784246444702,5036.1,5052.1,"And so this is a similar construction that's used for our City's current business and occupation just tax and it is a way of defining the tax base, so that it relates to those activities that are occurring in Seattle, and not in other jurisdictions.",,,
960,0.8604806661605835,5053.6,5058.1," So similar to our existing B&O tax, there is a three-part test.",,,
961,0.8604806661605835,5058.1,5060.4,That is applied in administering.,,,
962,0.8604806661605835,5060.4,5061.8,This bill as proposed.,,,
963,0.8604806661605835,5062.3,5066.7,One is just determining if the individual is primarily assigned.,,,
964,0.8604806661605835,5066.7,5072.3,"So the place of business where that employee works is in Seattle, that would be the first check.",,,
965,0.8604806661605835,5073.1,5083.2,"If an employee is not primarily assigned to one specific location, but the entire amount of that",,,
966,0.8816685080528259,5083.4,5085.4, Persons payroll expense would be assigned.,,,
967,0.8816685080528259,5085.4,5101.2,"And then finally, if the employee is primarily assigned to any one particular location of business, but they do not perform 50% or more of their activities, but the new guidance,",,,
968,0.894374668598175,5112.1,5123.3, So we're having questions in since the bill was introduced about how the animals died in bigger distance.,,,
969,0.894374668598175,5124.7,5129.8,And here are a few of the most frequent questions that are asked.,,,
970,0.894374668598175,5130.0,5134.5,I would note that with the independent contractor it is specifically,,,
971,0.8042572736740112,5142.0,5151.6, So this these are independent contractors one thinks about the gig economy and then and that's what we're talking about your intellect enlargement.,,,
972,0.8042572736740112,5151.6,5162.5,It's how we formed by those independent contractors factor into the calculation of a business payroll against the seven million dollar threshold.,,,
973,0.8042572736740112,5163.1,5170.2,And the key here is if a business is employing independent contractor and that independent,,,
974,0.8730992078781128,5170.4,5181.5," Contractors payroll is not being included in some other business than that, the payment to that independent contractor would be included in that businesses are all expense.",,,
975,0.8730992078781128,5181.7,5184.5,"So again, that is specifically noted in the legislation.",,,
976,0.8730992078781128,5185.0,5197.0,"The next to that all discussed briefly are, are, are rather interpretations ability of organizing business.",,,
977,0.8730992078781128,5197.7,5200.2,One of these is integrated Enterprise,,,
978,0.8352060914039612,5200.6,5210.7, And so this is a case where perhaps a business advertisers and speaks about itself as one larger entity.,,,
979,0.8352060914039612,5210.7,5230.2,"But in fact could be a collection of smaller independently operated businesses that function under a single Management Consulting Group and for the purposes of this earn something, we're not both business, it is for them, how they calculate their seven,",,,
980,0.71670001745224,5230.3,5237.8," Joined their payroll against the sirloin dollar threshold, each one of those independent businesses would be measuring 27.2.",,,
981,0.71670001745224,5246.2,5253.9,A larger restaurant Enterprise that operates a number of different questions.,,,
982,0.831203043460846,5260.7,5264.9," And then finally, on this will be more familiar but the concept of a franchise.",,,
983,0.831203043460846,5264.9,5269.0,And so there are National National.,,,
984,0.831203043460846,5274.7,5279.4,One of those franchises will have its own discrete individual business license.,,,
985,0.831203043460846,5279.7,5289.1,"So rather than say all the McDonald's in the city just to use a familiar example, tallying up and down.",,,

1214,0.711678147315979,6777.8,6785.3,I'm curious what the definition of a near-term spending commitment is just for clarification like there's no,,,
1215,0.9128382205963135,6786.3,6791.0, Like there's no current plan to use it or there are current plans but it's not for another year.,,,
1216,0.9128382205963135,6791.0,6792.1,Like what does that mean?,,,
1217,0.9128382205963135,6793.1,6805.8,"Well, I would say that the answer is year by year the the funds are fed by resources revenues and most cases.",,,

1226,0.9064930081367493,6875.1,6877.2,I'd do have an additional question.,,,

1230,0.9064930081367493,6890.1,6901.0,I didn't see a number enumerated for how much that inter fund loan was unless I missed it but it's the streetcar interfund alone was one.,,,

1233,0.9100871086120605,6908.2,6914.4,So I guess my question is how how big of an interfund loan was that one?,,,
1234,0.9100871086120605,6914.5,6917.6,And where did the money come from the backfill?,,,

1240,0.9072105288505554,6958.2,6960.4,"And so the amount of money that was eventually, oh.",,,
1241,0.9084457755088806,6960.6,6962.6, It was more than the original amount.,,,
1242,0.9084457755088806,6962.9,6975.2,"I don't know the answer to what specific revenues were used to repay the loan nor do I know in particular, the status of the loan today, so I will follow up with all of that information for you.",,,

1259,0.8722591400146484,7072.7,7074.6,Schedule is there any chance,,,
1260,0.8290555477142334,7074.8,7077.4, The Director of Finance could push the due date out.,,,
1261,0.8290555477142334,7077.4,7080.1,"Be on December 31st, 2021.",,,
1262,0.9128382205963135,7081.3,7082.4, I don't believe so.,,,
1263,0.9128382205963135,7082.4,7092.3,I think that the modification is generally to make the repayments sooner than the final authorized date of repayment.,,,
1264,0.9128382205963135,7092.6,7101.6,"If it takes, if in the event that it does take longer than Twelve Thirty, One of 2021 to repay the loan.",,,
1265,0.9128382205963135,7102.0,7110.8,Then my understanding is that additional Council authorization would be needed to to extend the period of the loan.,,,
1266,0.8096238374710083,7112.0,7117.8," Okay, and then a question about the interfund loan impact.",,,
1267,0.8096238374710083,7117.8,7128.0,I understand that you said based on previous calculations that we believe there's a buffer Within These fun sources that would not move it.,,,

1269,0.8096238374710083,7136.3,7139.4,Could you explain a little bit more about housing?,,,
1270,0.8096238374710083,7139.5,7141.6,"I know that when we do affordable,",,,
1271,0.8762214779853821,7141.8,7150.8, Housing often funding is committed in out years while the funds may still be in the fun Source itself.,,,
1272,0.8762214779853821,7151.0,7167.5,"A lot of times those dollars are accounted for, can you talk a little bit more about the office of housing or any analysis that we've done to analyze whether or not the interfund loan would affect the future funding cycles for affordable housing, for example?",,,
1273,0.8762214779853821,7168.4,7169.1,"Yes, of course.",,,
1274,0.8762214779853821,7169.6,7171.6,And as you as you,,,
1275,0.737957775592804,7171.8,7180.0, Are your question points out the low income housing fund is the largest anticipated year ending fund balance.,,,
1276,0.737957775592804,7180.0,7197.9,So I think you're right to be asking probing about how stable that expectation is my understanding of how the office of housing partners with housing developers who are building.,,,
1277,0.737957775592804,7198.2,7201.7,"Affordable housing, is that it makes a",,,
1278,0.8675709366798401,7201.9,7212.6, It meant of City resources generally as a as a partner in a larger funding scheme for for any given project.,,,
1279,0.8675709366798401,7213.3,7231.6,Our funding is used to leverage other funding sources to support the entire project in order for other funding sources to to come to the table with their money so that the project can actually begin Construction.,,,
1280,0.3545074760913849,7231.7,7231.9, Mmm.,,,
1281,0.9128382205963135,7233.3,7236.5, The city has to demonstrate that it has.,,,
1282,0.9128382205963135,7237.7,7247.1,It has the resources actually committed to to all of the projects that are anticipating a partnership contribution from the city.,,,
1283,0.9128382205963135,7247.9,7262.5,"So the way that the city books its resources is it makes a commitment to fund X, number of millions of dollars for ABC, Housing Development, and it puts that money aside in the",,,

1286,0.7860601544380188,7284.8,7292.7,So that's why the low income housing fund has a rather large.,,,

1289,0.8446202874183655,7300.2,7304.9,I think of the roughly 250 or so million dollars of sir.,,,

1386,0.8397803902626038,7940.3,7946.3,So this legislation proposes taking 50 million dollars from each of these funding sources.,,,

1655,0.8928924798965454,9805.7,9815.7,"And if if the bill doesn't go into effect because the mayor didn't sign it with the city council, have an opportunity to reconsider this legislation.",,,
1656,0.8649086952209473,9816.8,9824.0," There would be no opportunity to reconsider legislation, so it could be reintroduced in as a new usually, numbered bill.",,,
1657,0.7804071307182312,9826.5,9833.8," is it as simple as a reintroduction with a new Council, Bill, Tom or would there have to be something that substantively different",,,
1658,0.9128385186195374,9836.0,9838.1, I do not know the answer to that question.,,,
1659,0.9128385186195374,9838.1,9844.9,Specifically a council president perhaps someone else on the call otherwise I could follow up.,,,
1660,0.8204031586647034,9846.3,9847.4," Hi, this is Dan eater.",,,
1661,0.8204031586647034,9847.7,9865.4,"I believe that the substantive change that would need to take place in the circumstance that you just described council president where the mayor either vetoed the bill or just simply withheld her signature as Tom mentioned, the bill would not go into effect.",,,
1662,0.8204031586647034,9865.6,9875.7,"If the council wanted to take up a new bill, the substantive change would be that it would not be emergency legislation or also if it were otherwise the same",,,
1663,0.8870570063591003,9876.1,9882.7, At least the emergency Clause with cause would need to be eliminated from The Proposal.,,,
1664,0.6769781112670898,9885.8,9890.1, It's Council Central staff could follow up with me offline on on that.,,,
1665,0.6769781112670898,9890.1,9897.6,I think that would be helpful to me because my understanding is a little different than what you've just described an so.,,,
1666,0.6769781112670898,9898.1,9904.1,"So if we could if we could connect Offline that that would be greatly appreciated, Chairman's.",,,

1674,0.7944549322128296,9929.9,9945.7,"Following up with council, president Gonzalez has question around the effective date of she asked, if there would be any taxes collected in the year 2020, and I believe you said the answer is no, even though the legislation says effective in 2020.",,,
1675,0.7944549322128296,9946.1,9948.0,Can you also confirm my understanding?,,,
1676,0.7944549322128296,9948.0,9951.8,Was that there would be no taxes collected in the year 2021.,,,
1677,0.8128708004951477,9952.1,9955.5, There that those would not be due until 2022.,,,
1678,0.8128708004951477,9955.6,9959.8,"Looking back at the 20 21 year, can you comment on that first briefly?",,,
1679,0.8337264060974121,9962.1,9967.3," That is correct, the liabilities will accrue for 2020.",,,
1680,0.8337264060974121,9967.3,9979.0,"And, for 2021, though, the payments are not do from businesses until that final tax payment of 2021, which is normally do February of 2022.",,,

1682,0.8536211848258972,9991.0,10001.9," Okay, so looking at slide number four, I had a follow-up question on this in determining, which businesses have a seven million dollar or higher Seattle.",,,
1683,0.8536211848258972,10001.9,10018.1,"Payroll in the previous year, are we also looking at 20, 21 years, or is it a different threshold that we are looking at to determine which businesses have a higher Seattle, payroll in 77 million dollars.",,,
1684,0.7952437996864319,10019.4,10028.4," So if I'm understanding the question correctly in each year, the businesses will be looking at their most immediate prior year.",,,
1685,0.7952437996864319,10028.4,10037.5,"So for making a determination of tax liability in 2020, businesses will be looking at their 20, 25 or 2019 payroll.",,,
1686,0.7952437996864319,10038.1,10048.9,"And so going in order, if businesses are determining their tax liability for 2021, they will be looking at whether or not their payroll.",,,
1687,0.7817221283912659,10049.5,10065.9, We're above or below the seven million dollar threshold in 2020 and that basically carries through to you know through the life of the tax always looking back at the prior Year's payroll and determine to determine whether or not they have liability in the current year.,,,

1693,0.8138813376426697,10106.3,10116.3,"I believe the answer is yes, but I want to double-check when you look at the three sub bullets here, is it similar language that you have pulled from from the house?",,,
