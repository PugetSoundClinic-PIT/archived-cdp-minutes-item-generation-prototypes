89,0.97,485.151,489.388,It's largely congruent with recommendations by the urban forestry Commission.,14,,

91,0.97,492.058,493.492,Three.,14,,

117,0.97,627.059,627.293,Sorry.,19,,
118,0.97,627.293,628.728,I've never tried to do this before.,19,,

120,0.97,628.961,629.161,Yes.,19,,
121,0.97,629.161,635.701,I am speaking on behalf of Thorton Creek alliance.,19,,
122,0.97,635.701,637.403,I wanted to make a couple of comments.,19,,
123,0.97,637.403,640.706,We will be sending in a letter.,19,,
124,0.97,640.706,642.608,There is a major shortfall with the protection code.,19,,
125,0.97,642.608,655.388,"The 2020 urban forestry management plan, under key performance indicators, recommends canopy activity.",19,,
126,0.97,655.388,658.257,Urban forests contain a significant amount of continuous habitat for various types of wildlife.,19,,
127,0.97,658.257,660.159,Seattle has wildlife in corridors all over town.,19,,
128,0.97,660.159,664.23,But there is no support for this in the proposed code.,19,,
129,0.97,664.23,664.497,Metrics.,19,,
130,0.97,664.497,672.438,The same management plan identifies funding for citywide Pre-Surveys on private property.,19,,
131,0.97,672.438,682.748,"Yet according to the 2016 canopy cover study, 72%, that's about three quarters of our canopy coverage, is in private yards.",19,,
132,0.97,682.748,689.388,Funding for a complete survey is needed if we are ever to have excellent tracking on private property that we see today.,19,,
133,0.97,689.388,700.066,Thank you for this opportunity to speak and a big thanks for supporting our cities need for healthy and functional tree Canopies.,19,,

138,0.97,709.075,712.144,Thank you so much.,21,,
139,0.97,712.144,725.558,I just wanted to note that the Sdci grass ordinance doesn't create a separate urban forestry division or even propose hiring experts in urban forestry.,21,,
140,0.97,725.558,737.269,This draft affects the future of all of Seattle's trees yet Sdci has only two exhaustive--on staff.,21,,
141,0.97,737.269,740.873,And no urban forestry experts.,21,,
142,0.97,740.873,748.247,The city should create a separate independent Department of climate and higher Prfessional urban Foresters.,21,,
143,0.97,748.247,750.583,This is what many other cities do.,21,,
144,0.97,750.583,754.854,Only then can we ensure that our beautiful trees will be enjoyed by future generations.,21,,
145,0.97,754.854,759.992,Thank you so much.,21,,

155,0.97,783.015,785.985,"I'm worried that we are going to lose more of our exceptional, significant trees.",23,,
156,0.97,785.985,792.091,In this new ordinance we need to keep the ones that are six inches to 12 inches in diameter on proposal site plans.,23,,
157,0.97,792.091,799.298,Under this proposal only trees 12 inches and larger would be on the size development plan.,23,,
158,0.97,799.298,806.138,"The current requirement is that site plans have to show all trees, six inches and larger.",23,,
159,0.97,806.138,818.918,"The report done in 2012 States that within a single family residential unit, 18% of the urban forestry trees are over 12 inches in diameter.",23,,
160,0.97,818.918,820.953,55% are less than six inches on average.,23,,
161,0.97,820.953,831.33,"46% of the trees will be large at maturation, currently with a trunk diameter less than 12 inches.",23,,
162,0.97,831.33,841.44,45% of Seattle's trees in the single-family zone are over six inches.,23,,
163,0.97,841.44,846.979,-- will only include those 12 and larger.,23,,
164,0.97,846.979,852.151,Only about 18% of the trees on single-family sites would be noted on the site plan.,23,,
165,0.97,852.151,860.426,I'm sure you know that there is a hole in the sky where the tree once was.,23,,
166,0.97,860.426,864.563,A picture of some huge elder trees that were taken down.,23,,
167,0.97,864.563,868.534,You can see them.,23,,
168,0.97,868.534,870.603,There is a wonderful picture going around of these trees.,23,,
169,0.97,870.603,876.542,"Not wonderful, it's tragic.",23,,
170,0.97,876.542,878.077,I know you know what is going on.,23,,

186,0.97,939.738,940.439,Welcome.,25,,
187,0.97,940.439,944.677,Thank you so much for having us here today.,25,,
188,0.97,944.677,960.025,"I want to urge the Council, as they are reviewing the draft, to establish a permanent system for the removal of all trees over six inches at Dsh.",25,,
189,0.97,960.025,973.639,Missing from the legislation is the expansion of the permit system for the removal of trees on private property and it has been mentioned that 72% of our tree count is on private lots.,25,,
190,0.97,973.639,979.845,The ordinance does not require homeowners to obtain a permit for the removal of trees.,25,,
191,0.97,979.845,989.221,"These are 6 to 24 inch, defending on the definition of exceptional.",25,,
192,0.97,989.221,995.928,They can remove up to three exceptional trees per year without a permit.,25,,
193,0.97,995.928,997.162,The permit removal system accomplishes several things.,25,,
194,0.97,997.162,999.064,It allows the city to accurately track tree removal.,25,,
195,0.97,999.064,1001.734,It allows the city to manage replacement of lost tree canopy.,25,,
196,0.97,1001.734,1007.673,It provides the opportunity to engage with property owners about the value of trees.,25,,
197,0.97,1007.673,1011.61,And potentially protect wildlife.,25,,
198,0.97,1011.61,1025.224,Permitting for tree removal and providing a link at the bottom of the permit with a message that tree removal can impact wildlife and migratory birds.,25,,
199,0.97,1025.224,1031.397,The current proposal calls for voluntary reporting of tree removal for significant trees.,25,,
200,0.97,1031.397,1040.606,We think that this will lead to tree loss that will go untracked and most likely not be replaced elsewhere on the site or in the city.,25,,
201,0.97,1040.606,1048.647,"It also continues the practice of average citizens having to police tree regulation, which is not sufficient and can be downright dangerous.",25,,
202,0.97,1048.647,1071.437,"In fact when the equity Toolkit was applied to the urban forest management plan, a survey showed that self and residence prefer not to rely on the system.",25,,
203,0.97,1071.437,1073.105,--,25,,
204,0.97,1073.105,1074.773,"Thank you, Jessica, for your comments.",26,,
205,0.97,1074.773,1078.877,If there is anything further please feel free to send them to my office.,26,,
206,0.97,1078.877,1083.615,Next up we have June blue Spruce.,26,,
207,0.97,1083.615,1085.05,"June, I see you are present.",26,,
208,0.97,1085.05,1088.52,Press Star and six.,26,,
209,0.97,1088.52,1091.39,"David, you are not present.",26,,
210,0.97,1091.39,1094.059,If you would like to speak now is the time to call in.,26,,
211,0.97,1094.059,1095.494,"June, you are off mute.",26,,
212,0.97,1095.494,1096.728,Can you hear me?,27,,
213,0.97,1096.728,1103.535,Yes we can.,28,,
214,0.97,1103.535,1103.802,Hello?,29,,
215,0.97,1103.802,1104.57,Can you hear me?,29,,
216,0.97,1104.57,1105.604,Yes we can.,30,,
217,0.97,1105.604,1106.505,Can you hear us?,30,,
218,0.97,1106.505,1108.273,Yes.,31,,
219,0.97,1108.273,1108.507,Sorry.,31,,
220,0.97,1108.507,1110.542,I just want to agree with everything everybody has said.,31,,
221,0.97,1110.542,1114.012,I won't waste time repeating things.,31,,
222,0.97,1114.012,1125.591,The most egregious problem with the draft is that the implementation of it would now fall under master use permit one.,31,,
223,0.97,1125.591,1134.066,That means the Sdci regarding trees during development would no longer be Appealable for the hearing Examiner and this is unacceptable.,31,,
224,0.97,1134.066,1139.404,Physical replacement for trees on site is only one for one.,31,,
225,0.97,1139.404,1148.046,I urge that replacement requirements state that we provide equivalent canopy within 20 to 25 years.,31,,
226,0.97,1148.046,1158.09,Otherwise an 80-Year-Old tree might take 80 years to provide equivalent canopy protection.,31,,
227,0.97,1158.09,1161.894,We can't wait that long with global warming heating up our urban climates.,31,,
228,0.97,1161.894,1173.105,"I want to underscore that issue, the diameter of the trees that can be removed.",31,,
229,0.97,1173.105,1181.513,It has been increased.,31,,
230,0.97,1181.513,1183.916,"It's three trees per year for Homeowner to remove, that's too many.",31,,
231,0.97,1183.916,1185.317,Even if it's 12 inches or greater.,31,,
232,0.97,1185.317,1201.533,I wanted to say that given the cities economic and racial equity--is changing the zoning laws.,31,,
233,0.97,1201.533,1202.634,It's a great thing to do.,31,,
234,0.97,1202.634,1213.946,But the problem is that it will increase pressure as we increase density and what has been single-family zoned areas.,31,,
235,0.97,1213.946,1224.022,It's going to be more and more incentive to remove trees.,31,,
236,0.97,1224.022,1227.759,Creative design can prevent that.,31,,
237,0.97,1227.759,1229.628,We have to have a stronger ordinance to detail.,31,,
238,0.97,1229.628,1230.028,Thank you.,31,,
239,0.97,1230.028,1231.063,"Thank you, June.",32,,
240,0.97,1231.063,1239.538,"Up next and last, Steve.",32,,
241,0.97,1239.538,1244.443,"David, you're still not present.",32,,
242,0.97,1244.443,1246.511,If you would like to speak then please call in now.,32,,
243,0.97,1246.511,1246.912,"Steve, welcome.",32,,
244,0.97,1246.912,1247.746,Please take it away.,32,,
245,0.97,1247.746,1248.347,Thank you.,33,,
246,0.97,1248.347,1251.016,I'm speaking for the coalition of the stronger tree ordinance.,33,,
247,0.97,1251.016,1259.691,This ordinance is a complex measure of 13 years of trying to get an update to the ordinance.,33,,
248,0.97,1259.691,1263.595,There are a lot of provisions that we do support.,33,,
249,0.97,1263.595,1274.573,Including implementing--down to 24 inches as the upper threshold instead of 30 inches.,33,,
250,0.97,1274.573,1280.846,There are a lot of provisions that create concerns that we urge you to look at.,33,,
251,0.97,1280.846,1291.189,One is that the replacement--Sdci general funds.,33,,
252,0.97,1291.189,1291.823,And preservation funds.,33,,
253,0.97,1291.823,1293.625,Like Portland Oregon.,33,,
254,0.97,1293.625,1304.97,"They need to go into use for what they are being raised for, which is to replace trees that were removed.",33,,
255,0.97,1304.97,1312.811,The draft needs to also coordinate in terms of the tree definitions.,33,,
256,0.97,1312.811,1318.817,There is a different definition being proposed.,33,,
257,0.97,1318.817,1323.055,For consistency for us and others working in the city they obviously need to have the same definition.,33,,
258,0.97,1323.055,1327.459,"Not different definitions, depending on which zone they work on in the city.",33,,
259,0.97,1327.459,1335.0,"The draft ordinance, surprisingly, does not put in the issue of maximizing the retention of existing trees on a lot.",33,,
260,0.97,1335.0,1337.502,This is what Austin Texas does.,33,,
261,0.97,1337.502,1355.62,"Actually in the drafting, when there is short planning going on, and the initial process, that language is in the landscape around the Land-Use section.",33,,
262,0.97,1355.62,1358.223,It should continue through the whole development process.,33,,
263,0.97,1358.223,1374.172,Another issue is the Sdci staff will have the legal authority to enter property if a violation is occurring . This becomes an issue frequently when he we have a point raised that Sdci says we can't enter the property.,33,,
264,0.97,1374.172,1377.275,"Thank you, Steve.",34,,
265,0.97,1377.275,1382.447,"If you have more comments for the official record, please send them to my office.",34,,
266,0.97,1382.447,1385.117,I'm doing one last check.,34,,
267,0.97,1385.117,1393.925,Can you confirm there are no more public registrants currently present?,34,,
268,0.97,1393.925,1394.559,That is correct.,35,,
269,0.97,1394.559,1402.968,There are no further public comment registrants.,35,,
270,0.97,1402.968,1406.238,Seeing as we have no additional speakers we will move on to the next agenda item.,36,,
271,0.97,1406.238,1418.517,"Before I do so I will just take a moment, because we have public Commenters still listening, two items about trees.",36,,
272,0.97,1418.517,1420.352,"Weston Brinkley, a longtime chair for the forest Commission.",36,,
273,0.97,1420.352,1421.787,He is attending his last meeting today.,36,,
274,0.97,1421.787,1423.889,I want to take a moment to recognize his great work.,36,,

277,0.97,1432.798,1434.699,I really want to thank you for your service.,36,,
278,0.97,1434.699,1444.876,"With that said, in my last newsletter, I used language that Conflated many of the aspects of the tree ordinance.",36,,
279,0.97,1444.876,1452.651,I am Cosponsoring Councilman Alex Pederson's bill.,36,,
280,0.97,1452.651,1460.225,My apologies for anyone who saw that statement and was confused.,36,,

374,0.97,1977.308,1983.648,The home occupation cannot substantially increase traffic and On-Screen parking in the vicinity.,56,,
375,0.97,1983.648,1988.953,Signs identifying the business cannot exceed 64 square inches in size.,56,,
376,0.97,1988.953,1995.36,However there is no limit on how many signs you may have.,56,,
377,0.97,1995.36,1997.295,Outdoor storage cannot be associated with the home occupations.,56,,
378,0.97,1997.295,2003.167,"There are limits on noise, glare, and other impacts.",56,,
379,0.97,2003.167,2004.402,I share this with you.,56,,
380,0.97,2004.402,2009.941,This is where the starting place for the Land-Use code was regarding code based businesses.,56,,
381,0.97,2009.941,2015.88,I will move us to the next slide and discuss the changes that were made to the business home of bill.,56,,
382,0.97,2015.88,2022.487,I will be happy to take questions.,56,,
383,0.97,2022.487,2026.591,"On an interim basis, for one year.",56,,
384,0.97,2026.591,2029.26,That's what we will add today at the conclusion of the year.,56,,
385,0.97,2029.26,2035.032,Home occupations would not be subject to a limit on the number of employees.,56,,
386,0.97,2035.032,2045.877,"Only two Non-Dwelling people, people not living in the House could be employees.",56,,
387,0.97,2045.877,2051.649,Allowing walk UPS to occur rather than the appointments that were required previously.,56,,
388,0.97,2051.649,2056.821,Being flexible with increased traffic and parking demand.,56,,
389,0.97,2056.821,2067.865,I can tell you that the traffic and parking demand was the one that we were most aware of for potential detrimental impacts.,56,,
390,0.97,2067.865,2069.901,I have personally never seen any complaints as of today.,56,,
391,0.97,2069.901,2082.213,"Additionally, Home-Based occupations would be allowed to have signs of 120 square inches and they would only be able to have one.",56,,
392,0.97,2082.213,2085.683,They can have 64 square inches and as many as they want.,56,,
393,0.97,2085.683,2089.353,Now they are only allowed to have one that is larger.,56,,
394,0.97,2089.353,2094.959,This is the crux of it.,56,,
395,0.97,2094.959,2097.695,The use of the space required for parking for the Home-Based occupation.,56,,
396,0.97,2097.695,2100.331,This is where we get to the garage base.,56,,
397,0.97,2100.331,2113.678,"If your home, your garage, is required to be used for your Offstreet parking you could not have a Home-Based business in your garage.",56,,
398,0.97,2113.678,2119.617,I know many people that use their garages for other things instead of parking cars.,56,,
399,0.97,2119.617,2121.686,I wish more people used their garage to park cars.,56,,
400,0.97,2121.686,2123.354,We will save that comment for another day.,56,,
401,0.97,2123.354,2128.593,These are the changes which are allowing for Non-Dwelling humans to be employees.,56,,
402,0.97,2128.593,2135.566,The walk UPS are allowed.,56,,
403,0.97,2135.566,2138.836,Increased traffic and parking may occur.,56,,
404,0.97,2138.836,2146.811,Having one sign that is larger and allowing garage space to be used for businesses.,56,,
405,0.97,2146.811,2147.678,That's where we are at.,56,,
406,0.97,2147.678,2151.315,I can tell you one change that I would like to see as a permanent regulation.,56,,
407,0.97,2151.315,2155.686,Figuring out permitting for home businesses.,56,,
408,0.97,2155.686,2159.957,Right now we don't have a good amount.,56,,
409,0.97,2159.957,2170.835,"I don't need it to be an additional cost I just come at this point, don't have the data I need to filter out which ones are Home-Based and which are not Home-Based businesses.",56,,
410,0.97,2170.835,2179.243,With that presentation do the colleagues have any questions?,56,,
411,0.97,2179.243,2182.947,Councilmember Warren as peppered me with all of the questions.,56,,
412,0.97,2182.947,2189.854,If you could watch last year's presentation.,56,,
413,0.97,2189.854,2192.823,"Please, let me know what you're thinking.",56,,
414,0.97,2192.823,2197.895,Councilmember Sara Nelson.,56,,
415,0.97,2197.895,2201.365,You are on mute.,56,,
416,0.97,2201.365,2207.805,Better safe than sorry.,56,,
417,0.97,2207.805,2209.206,Thanks.,57,,
418,0.97,2209.206,2214.245,I have a question about this sign.,57,,
419,0.97,2214.245,2218.583,I have no idea how big 720 is.,57,,
420,0.97,2218.583,2219.617,"Anyway, that doesn't really matter.",57,,
421,0.97,2219.617,2232.73,"My question is, did counsel bill 120001 go through a checklist for impact of sign?",57,,
422,0.97,2232.73,2237.969,I know it's about being eliminated.,57,,
423,0.97,2237.969,2243.841,I'm asking this question because I'm getting up to speed on the Checklists and signs.,57,,
424,0.97,2243.841,2245.676,Because I have a Projectgoing on separate from this.,57,,
425,0.97,2245.676,2254.385,Do you know if it went through as a checklist?,57,,
426,0.97,2254.385,2255.786,I ask you to remind me here.,58,,
427,0.97,2255.786,2269.734,I know this was adopted on an emergency basis due to the pandemic that is why we want to make sure any permanent regulations will go through all of the Checklists and all of the finalization.,58,,
428,0.97,2269.734,2277.742,We have an extension to ensure there is not a lapse between the emergency declaration and permanent regulations.,58,,
429,0.97,2277.742,2282.847,I don't believe this was on the checklist.,58,,
430,0.97,2282.847,2285.95,I believe it did.,59,,
431,0.97,2285.95,2286.35,Okay.,60,,
432,0.97,2286.35,2288.819,We will ask next time.,60,,
433,0.97,2288.819,2295.626,I want to reinforce that I don't have a strong opinion on this.,61,,
434,0.97,2295.626,2301.032,I do see that Councilmember Tammy J. Morales has a question.,61,,
435,0.97,2301.032,2303.0,I have a follow-up to that.,61,,
436,0.97,2303.0,2309.14,I will take turns.,61,,
437,0.97,2309.14,2311.842,You can get them all out and then I will go to her.,62,,
438,0.97,2311.842,2313.911,I just want to know how it's going.,63,,
439,0.97,2313.911,2324.322,I know that this was made to help small businesses during the pandemic but it was also seen as an opportunity to Incubate small businesses.,63,,
440,0.97,2324.322,2336.067,"He said that there hasn't been any complaints about parking and all of that but I'm just wanting to know, as a small business owner, have we seen people take advantage of this program?",63,,
441,0.97,2336.067,2338.269,That would be great news.,63,,
442,0.97,2338.269,2338.703,Yes.,64,,
443,0.97,2338.703,2349.58,What I can say is that I personally have not received any complaints.,64,,
444,0.97,2349.58,2352.216,That is part of what we are taking into consideration for permanent regulations.,64,,
445,0.97,2352.216,2354.151,We will ask that question of Sdci.,64,,
446,0.97,2354.151,2356.687,This is a complaint based enforcement.,64,,
447,0.97,2356.687,2369.967,What I can tell you is that one small business in particular had their garage storefront.,64,,
448,0.97,2369.967,2373.637,They have now closed their garage storefront and moved into the brewery district.,64,,
449,0.97,2373.637,2376.34,I understand there might be a competition aspect there.,64,,
450,0.97,2376.34,2386.183,It's one of those things that I'm just so happy to see this program be used as an Incubator to go from garage to brick and mortar.,64,,
451,0.97,2386.183,2391.088,We have seen success.,64,,
452,0.97,2391.088,2391.489,Great.,65,,
453,0.97,2391.489,2396.46,I am all for anything that can help small businesses.,65,,
454,0.97,2396.46,2399.997,I'm just coming out of this with Positivity.,65,,
455,0.97,2399.997,2400.431,Excellent.,66,,
456,0.97,2400.431,2402.5,That's great.,66,,
457,0.97,2402.5,2404.402,Any other questions?,66,,
458,0.97,2404.402,2405.002,I'm done.,67,,
459,0.97,2405.002,2410.241,Thanks.,68,,
460,0.97,2410.241,2413.711,Great questions.,68,,
461,0.97,2413.711,2415.146,"Chairman Tammy J. Morales, please take it away.",68,,
462,0.97,2415.146,2419.25,I don't know if I have any real questions I just want to express my support for this.,69,,
463,0.97,2419.25,2420.451,I think it's really important.,69,,
464,0.97,2420.451,2427.391,Not just in the pandemic but as we start to move toward conversations about creating vibrant neighborhoods throughout the city.,69,,
465,0.97,2427.391,2429.66,Allowing people to run small businesses in their home.,69,,
466,0.97,2429.66,2438.502,"Whether it is a brewery, a cider manufacturing office, Childcare.",69,,
467,0.97,2438.502,2442.339,This is the way things used to work.,69,,
468,0.97,2442.339,2445.342,Lots of people ran small businesses out of their home.,69,,
469,0.97,2445.342,2458.989,"For me, when I think about how we could create this 15 minute city idea that we were talking about, allowing people to provide essential services in their home is an important part of that.",69,,
470,0.97,2458.989,2460.124,I do have a question.,69,,
471,0.97,2460.124,2466.497,I don't know if it's the right way.,69,,
472,0.97,2466.497,2474.104,"When you're talking about garages, the implication is this applies to only Single- family homes.",69,,
473,0.97,2474.104,2482.813,I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how this would apply to home occupations for folks who live in apartments.,69,,
474,0.97,2482.813,2491.489,"The provision in this bill, what the land use code was doing was restricting use.",70,,
475,0.97,2491.489,2493.824,Not providing permission for use.,70,,
476,0.97,2493.824,2501.732,In the underlying land use code there is a restriction for anywhere that is used for Offstreet parking.,70,,
477,0.97,2501.732,2503.133,It cannot be used for Home- based business.,70,,
478,0.97,2503.133,2511.775,So it is not an exclusion of people living in condos or apartments or Townhomes or anything else like that.,70,,
479,0.97,2511.775,2525.99,It is the base zoning requirement to exclude the uses on garages.,70,,
480,0.97,2525.99,2526.39,Wonderful.,70,,
481,0.97,2526.39,2531.729,"Any other questions, colleagues?",70,,
482,0.97,2531.729,2538.369,I will send a link to last year's presentation around Councilmember Warren's.,70,,
483,0.97,2538.369,2542.506,He grilled me well.,70,,
484,0.97,2542.506,2549.48,I really appreciated her line of questioning because I think it helped describe the situation better.,70,,
485,0.97,2549.48,2557.488,I'm not seeing any further questions.,70,,
486,0.97,2557.488,2559.59,We will have Freeman before us at our next committee.,70,,
487,0.97,2559.59,2566.163,This is an extension of the temporary provisions while the final guidelines and policies are being made.,70,,
488,0.97,2566.163,2568.632,"Again, thank you for allowing me to discuss this.",70,,
489,0.97,2568.632,2570.067,We will be back in two weeks.,70,,
490,0.97,2570.067,2572.836,At that time I will let you know.,70,,
491,0.97,2572.836,2583.18,I will be asking about the rule against having a vote on the same day as a hearing.,70,,
492,0.97,2583.18,2590.354,I think this is a good rule because it to make sure that we do not just bring up a topic and voted out.,70,,
493,0.97,2590.354,2597.328,Item number three.,70,,
494,0.97,2597.328,2599.863,This is the committee meeting I have been waiting for for two years.,70,,
495,0.97,2599.863,2602.7,The final item today is a quarterly tree report from Sdci and Osc.,70,,
496,0.97,2602.7,2612.176,Would you plead read the item into the record?,70,,
497,0.97,2612.176,2614.511,--,71,,
498,0.97,2614.511,2617.281,Thank you.,72,,
499,0.97,2617.281,2624.054,We have been having departments join us quarterly for tree reports since I began in 2020.,72,,
500,0.97,2624.054,2630.427,Today's presentation should be particularly interesting because it follows the draft tree protection ordinance for Sdci.,72,,
501,0.97,2630.427,2640.07,We are presented by people from Sdci and Osc.,72,,
502,0.97,2640.07,2640.871,Please take it away.,72,,
503,0.97,2640.871,2644.475,"Colleagues, if you have questions along the way raise your hand and I will call on you.",72,,
504,0.97,2644.475,2648.479,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",73,,
505,0.97,2648.479,2653.384,Can you see my screen now?,73,,
506,0.97,2653.384,2660.691,Sdci and Osc are proud to provide a quarterly meeting on efforts to update the tree protections.,73,,
507,0.97,2660.691,2666.597,I am the urban forestry advisor.,73,,
508,0.97,2666.597,2669.233,And Sean is here this afternoon as well.,73,,
509,0.97,2669.233,2682.513,"I will cover a few updates on the urban forest management plan, which we have been beefing you on and was finalized in 2021.",73,,
510,0.97,2682.513,2689.653,"Shauna will review resolution 31902, which we have responded to in this work and she will talk about the draft legislation and the next steps in this work.",73,,
511,0.97,2689.653,2707.571,"First off, to Recap, the management plan is a document that provides a framework for policy and action that guides city government decision-making to help Seattle maintain, preserve, enhance, and restore its urban forest.",73,,
512,0.97,2707.571,2722.786,"The core of the plan is a set of outcomes, strategies, and indicators that will support a healthy urban forest across the public and private owned lands.",73,,
513,0.97,2722.786,2731.662,It is organized in an action agenda that outlines the steps that the city and community partners will take to implement the plan over the next five years in which we aim to make sure that the urban forest is properly managed.,73,,
514,0.97,2731.662,2737.167,There are key urban forest reactions ongoing vice city departments.,73,,
515,0.97,2737.167,2745.342,Such as planting trees and complying with the 2-for-1 tree replacement policy.,73,,
516,0.97,2745.342,2746.577,Management of city properties and natural landscapes.,73,,
517,0.97,2746.577,2751.115,Basic plans.,73,,
518,0.97,2751.115,2753.751,Coordinating efforts and updating initiatives and regulations to support the urban forest.,73,,
519,0.97,2753.751,2763.427,For today I will focus on the seven actions that the plan identifies as the highest priorities of the 19 actions in the action agenda.,73,,
520,0.97,2763.427,2772.703,These seven actions were Prioritized due to their importance in managing the urban forest and in supporting and responding to community can concerns.,73,,
521,0.97,2772.703,2773.504,Some are already underway.,73,,
522,0.97,2773.504,2787.484,You will hear more shortly about the tree protection regulations.,73,,
523,0.97,2787.484,2791.088,"Other items have new work commencing this year, which I will share more about in the next slide.",73,,
524,0.97,2791.088,2800.797,And then some of the actions isolated for work later in the 2023/2024 year period we are tracking progress on the action agenda as we appropriate tasks toward these indoor annual report plans.,73,,
525,0.97,2800.797,2808.472,I want to highlight just a few of the areas where implementation is currently happening.,73,,
526,0.97,2808.472,2820.551,"Under strategy one, action one is to create a strategy to improve access for people and environmental equity prior to communities to interest ships, apprenticeships, and jobs in urban forestry.",73,,
527,0.97,2820.551,2824.087,In 2022 we will have a gap and opportunity analysis of opportunity pathways for urban forestry.,73,,
528,0.97,2824.087,2838.635,"This is the first step towards creating a strategy to improve access for people and environmental communities to the Internships, apprenticeships, and jobs in urban forestry.",73,,
529,0.97,2838.635,2840.671,In the meantime work is underway across departments.,73,,
530,0.97,2840.671,2853.217,Parks and recreation's partnership is investing in youth development and job training programs to help train urban forestry leaders of tomorrow.,73,,
531,0.97,2853.217,2859.756,We are seeking to work in community partnerships to grow the number of contractors.,73,,
532,0.97,2859.756,2866.763,"Also under strategy one, action two, increase Treeplanting.",73,,
533,0.97,2866.763,2889.887,Several of the cities programs that plant trees do focus their funding efforts in these communities using tools such as the cities race and social justice in that--urban forestry Street program.,73,,
534,0.97,2889.887,2904.835,"In addition, the neighborhood team which distributes 1000 trees annually for planting my residence on private property focuses distribution on the priority areas as well.",73,,
535,0.97,2904.835,2915.012,"This focus on getting more trees into these communities will improve air quality, help mitigate extreme heat, and increase the health of natural spaces in communities with currently low canopy.",73,,
536,0.97,2915.012,2917.681,"Under strategy three, action eight is to perform a canopy coverage assessment.",73,,
537,0.97,2917.681,2939.102,"Every five years the city performs a canopy coverage assessment and we use this information to inform our urban forestry planning as it provides an estimate of the amount of tree canopy currently present in the city and relevant information on how the tree canopy has changed over time, how is it is distributed across the land and the Ecosystem that it provides to residents.",73,,
538,0.97,2939.102,2947.844,This helps us make effective and equitable decisions on tree canopy and its management.,73,,
539,0.97,2947.844,2951.715,In 2016 the assessment was done using data combined with imagery.,73,,
540,0.97,2951.715,2953.817,Nowthe 2021 assessment will be done with the same methodology.,73,,
541,0.97,2953.817,2961.191,We will get a more accurate amount of information on how the canopy has changed.,73,,
542,0.97,2961.191,2966.93,There was a delay in getting the letter.,73,,
543,0.97,2966.93,2968.365,That assessment is just now getting underway.,73,,
544,0.97,2968.365,2974.137,We expect to have those results by midyear this year.,73,,
545,0.97,2974.137,2985.716,"Again, I will just note that these are actions identified as priority actions in the management plan and all seven of the priority actions in the plan are set to happen this year as we get set for implementation.",73,,
546,0.97,2985.716,2987.417,"Chair Strauss, I saw your hand was up.",73,,
547,0.97,2987.417,2990.687,You have a question?,73,,
548,0.97,2990.687,2991.488,"Things, Patty.",74,,
549,0.97,2991.488,2992.656,That is really good information.,74,,
550,0.97,2992.656,2994.558,My question is actually about the pictures.,74,,
551,0.97,2994.558,2995.792,I can't see the captions.,74,,
552,0.97,2995.792,3004.801,Is the picture on the left on the neighborhood with third Avenue running down the middle of the frame?,74,,
553,0.97,3004.801,3006.603,I don't know the answer to that question.,75,,
554,0.97,3006.603,3007.838,Come back to me later.,76,,
555,0.97,3007.838,3014.01,That is an expert on the canopy assessment.,77,,
556,0.97,3014.01,3017.647,You can look that up and view it Online.,77,,
557,0.97,3017.647,3025.389,It's just here to show an example of the results that come out of that assessment and how it can affect neighborhoods.,77,,
558,0.97,3025.389,3027.924,Let me make sure I have my trivia questions correct.,78,,
559,0.97,3027.924,3030.894,Thank you.,79,,
560,0.97,3030.894,3031.962,That is it for me.,79,,
561,0.97,3031.962,3043.44,I will pass it over to cover details of the ordinance work.,79,,
562,0.97,3043.44,3044.508,"Thinks so much, Patty.",80,,
563,0.97,3044.508,3044.908,Great work.,80,,

566,0.97,3051.548,3063.36,As shown here to protect existing trees and Canopies to support future growth and density as provided for the cities conference of plan.,82,,
567,0.97,3063.36,3072.769,It asked us to consider strategies that allowed for housing and development as well as needs for low income and low canopy neighborhoods while balancing tree protection goals.,82,,
568,0.97,3072.769,3080.744,The resolution also directed us to report quarterly to the land use committee.,82,,

573,0.97,3114.444,3116.68,There's three types of regulated trees under the current regulations.,82,,
574,0.97,3116.68,3119.549,"Exceptional, which are the most ecologically and culturally important trees in the city.",82,,
575,0.97,3119.549,3123.22,Defined primarily by species and trunk size.,82,,
576,0.97,3123.22,3126.49,There are 70 or so tree species listed in our 2008 directors rule.,82,,
577,0.97,3126.49,3138.168,The current rules right now protect these trees from removal unless they are hazardous or if necessary to achieve the full development potential of a site.,82,,
578,0.97,3138.168,3140.27,"So if most trees are removed, they must be replaced.",82,,
579,0.97,3140.27,3149.312,Significant trees are trees that are over six inches in diameter but not defined in the current regulations.,82,,
580,0.97,3149.312,3155.585,These trees are an important part of the cities canopy but current rules do not require replacement.,82,,
581,0.97,3155.585,3167.531,"Heritage trees are trees that have been given a special designation by the heritage tree program, cosponsored by the Seattle Department of transportation.",82,,

586,0.97,3193.99,3196.66,Read Cedars and Sequoias.,82,,
587,0.97,3196.66,3203.833,You can see there is not a lot of difference between 24 inch and 30 inch.,82,,
588,0.97,3203.833,3208.638,"Generally, what we regulate right now in our existing tree code.",82,,

595,0.97,3241.504,3246.209,I'm looking at these three different maps.,83,,
596,0.97,3246.209,3256.453,The map on the far right-hand side his current regulation and the map on the far left is the proposed increased protection.,83,,
597,0.97,3256.453,3257.687,Is that the correct understanding?,83,,
598,0.97,3257.687,3260.557,"That is correct, Councilmember Strauss.",84,,
599,0.97,3260.557,3274.504,This is just a visual depiction of how many large trees and how much canopy we will be protecting under this ordinance.,85,,
600,0.97,3274.504,3276.306,Correct.,86,,
601,0.97,3276.306,3285.849,"Counsel, other colleagues, I just want to note that this is a visual depiction of what this tree protection will do.",87,,

603,0.97,3286.149,3291.554,Thank you.,88,,
604,0.97,3291.554,3297.627,The zoning applicable to the draft includes three major zoning categories.,88,,
605,0.97,3297.627,3302.899,"Single-family, multifamily and commercial.",88,,
606,0.97,3302.899,3305.101,Each of these large zoning categories have larger Subcategories underneath them.,88,,
607,0.97,3305.101,3310.807,"For example, multifamily has Lowrise one and two.",88,,
608,0.97,3310.807,3313.443,Which is generally town houses and rental houses.,88,,
609,0.97,3313.443,3318.715,The commercial includes neighborhood commercial and Seattle next.,88,,
610,0.97,3318.715,3323.086,Not all of the zones are shown here on this slide and they are further described in the draft legislation.,88,,
611,0.97,3323.086,3327.857,Thank you.,89,,
612,0.97,3327.857,3337.233,"On this one, correct me if I'm wrong, down town and industrial zones are not included in the draft.",89,,
613,0.97,3337.233,3337.934,Is that correct?,89,,
614,0.97,3337.934,3338.568,That is correct.,90,,
615,0.97,3338.568,3340.603,Help me understand why the decision was made.,91,,
616,0.97,3340.603,3344.474,I would just love to hear your thoughts on it.,91,,
617,0.97,3344.474,3360.457,"The draft covers all of the zones that are applicable to chapter 2511, the tree protection code.",92,,
618,0.97,3360.457,3361.891,Just teasing that out a little further.,93,,
619,0.97,3361.891,3365.995,Downtown and industrial zones are not included in there and that is why the protection is not extended?,93,,
620,0.97,3365.995,3366.463,That is correct.,94,,
621,0.97,3366.463,3371.334,The downtown zones are --,94,,
622,0.97,3371.334,3377.941,"I'm may be less concerned with downtown, which feels like a concrete jungle often times.",95,,
623,0.97,3377.941,3386.95,"And industrial zones, the only place that has trees is the Leary Triangle.",95,,
624,0.97,3386.95,3388.618,That is why I'm so focused on that space.,95,,
625,0.97,3388.618,3397.861,It feels like a tree desert in the industrial zone.,95,,
626,0.97,3397.861,3399.496,Would they be able to add industrial zones are?,95,,
627,0.97,3399.496,3404.4,Is there another reason why we should not be considering industrial zones?,95,,
628,0.97,3404.4,3417.147,"For the industrial zones, honestly we didn't look at those zones because they were not applicable to the chapter that we were doing the updates in.",96,,
629,0.97,3417.147,3431.528,"I think that, generally, the needs of business owners and industrial zones might be different than the needs of a commercial zone.",96,,
630,0.97,3431.528,3436.166,Like neighborhood commercial for example.,96,,
631,0.97,3436.166,3440.537,As far as sight distances and things like that.,96,,
632,0.97,3440.537,3443.106,And this decision would not prohibit us from planting trees.,97,,
633,0.97,3443.106,3446.576,Is that correct?,97,,
634,0.97,3446.576,3451.681,I think we would want to increase canopy citywide.,98,,
635,0.97,3451.681,3459.656,It could possibly be looked into further.,98,,
636,0.97,3459.656,3466.229,Let's dig into this a little bit more just because industrial zones need to have more trees.,99,,
637,0.97,3466.229,3467.063,I appreciate it.,99,,
638,0.97,3467.063,3467.397,Sorry.,99,,
639,0.97,3467.397,3478.508,These lines kind of came off the cuff.,99,,
640,0.97,3478.508,3479.342,Councilmember Nelson?,99,,
641,0.97,3479.342,3485.548,Which zones are the trees disappearing from the fastest?,100,,
642,0.97,3485.548,3489.786,The maps that you had in the previous slide are very compelling.,100,,
643,0.97,3489.786,3499.028,"Maybe this isn't for an answer here but I'm just wondering, are there particular zones amongst those on the screen that are most vulnerable?",100,,
644,0.97,3499.028,3504.567,To canopy loss.,100,,
645,0.97,3504.567,3506.736,"I would be happy to answer that question, Councilmember.",101,,
646,0.97,3506.736,3513.977,We see a lot of development pressure in the areas that are closer to the urban villages.,101,,
647,0.97,3513.977,3521.217,Zones that are supportive of town houses and road houses in the Lowrise zone.,101,,
648,0.97,3521.217,3533.73,"Compared to the larger, Single- family home lots that are in the edges of the city.",101,,
649,0.97,3533.73,3542.605,So like larger single-family lots are further away at urban centers.,101,,
650,0.97,3542.605,3546.809,They might have less development pressure generally.,101,,
651,0.97,3546.809,3548.311,I'm not talking about development pressure.,102,,
652,0.97,3548.311,3558.388,I 'm,102,,
653,0.97,3561.424,3583.746,"Right . So, right now we think collecting data with our tree Tracker worksheet, we do have data at this time I can check back and report what we have compiled so far.",103,,
654,0.97,3583.746,3599.896,"And maybe to put it into different words, the areas that are closest to the hubs with a fair amount are the places we are losing the most amount of trees rapidly.",104,,
655,0.97,3599.896,3602.231,Did I get the correct?,104,,
656,0.97,3602.231,3608.504,Yes.,105,,
657,0.97,3608.504,3626.623,"Why this bill is so important to be passed now and not to wait any longer is I thought we need that development to occur, and we need to be able to retrieve the rest of our city, and that is the importance of that connection.",106,,
658,0.97,3626.623,3634.864,"That is the same line of thought . Anselmo Nesson, is at the same?",106,,
659,0.97,3634.864,3637.533,We need both.,107,,
660,0.97,3637.533,3646.376,My question came from Anecdotally when I circulate the city and see large trees on single-family zones being cut down.,107,,
661,0.97,3646.376,3651.814,I noticed that as well as in other zones.,107,,
662,0.97,3651.814,3653.75,I will check back on the Tracker later.,107,,
663,0.97,3653.75,3659.022,Great . Thank you.,108,,
664,0.97,3659.022,3669.399,"Thank you, chair.",109,,
665,0.97,3670.533,3672.001,I look at this question from a different perspective.,109,,
666,0.97,3672.001,3680.643,I know that it is important to consider how to preserve trees.,109,,
667,0.97,3680.643,3689.852,My Understandig is that we need to be planting millions of trees in order to get the kind of canopy we are talking about.,109,,
668,0.97,3689.852,3701.431,"I am interested in the equity issues since so much of the South end lacks tree canopy and that has implications for health, environmental health and physical health of our neighbors.",109,,
669,0.97,3701.431,3717.98,"Can you talk a little bit about, and I know that is not the purpose of this particular legislation, but what the conversation is or the plans are for how we add to the tree canopy in an equitable way.",109,,
670,0.97,3717.98,3721.751,That is the point of this legislation.,110,,
671,0.97,3721.751,3741.137,"As there are going to be trees that cannot be preserved as we are creating the density we need, and that occurs, that has to tie in to us retraining our city . I am sorry for taking us on attention.",110,,
672,0.97,3741.137,3744.74,You can take it from here.,110,,
673,0.97,3744.74,3748.511,I would be happy to add to that.,111,,
674,0.97,3748.511,3757.553,We are exploring an option where payments received would go.,111,,
675,0.97,3757.553,3785.748,"Scci, we are exploring how those can be potentially directed to existing programs that can reach three areas where there is low canopy and low income as well focusing on areas in the South.",111,,
676,0.97,3793.222,3806.502,So the environmental draft legislation was prepared by Scci and input from our Stakeholders.,112,,
677,0.97,3806.502,3819.048,This slide here shows the highlights of the draft that include the two rules that are part of this draft package.,112,,
678,0.97,3819.048,3825.254,It includes an expansion of the existing definition of exceptional tree to regulate more trees over 24 inches in diameter.,112,,
679,0.97,3825.254,3832.829,That means including tree growth and heritage trees and that expanded exceptional tree definition.,112,,
680,0.97,3832.829,3847.944,It defines any tree that is 6 inches and greater not already defined as exceptional . and then it adds replacement for significant trees 12 inches and greater.,112,,
681,0.97,3847.944,3874.67,It also adds a new provision or clarifies that we want to have homebuilder Flexibilities to development standards to accommodate Trayvon attention and allows a payment and new option in special circumstances and clarifies the hazardous and emergency tree removal situations.,112,,
682,0.97,3874.67,3884.247,It simplifies the processes which means documentation of trees removed and replanted.,112,,
683,0.97,3884.247,3890.052,And it also updates enforcement by increasing the penalty amounts.,112,,
684,0.97,3890.052,3896.959,In the next five or six slides I would like to further breakdown what each of these key highlights are in that draft legislation.,112,,
685,0.97,3896.959,3908.804,I am just going to repeat back what I heard . I think this is the crux of the ordinance.,113,,
686,0.97,3908.804,3927.323,"We expand definitions and protections and provide flexibility to builders so if they can preserve the tree they can get, what other flexibility.",113,,
687,0.97,3927.323,3935.464,More protections and flexibility to preserve trees.,113,,
688,0.97,3935.464,3942.204,Addresses hazardous tree removal actions and updates enforcement provisions.,113,,
689,0.97,3942.204,3958.621,"And can you remind me, these are both director roles and the ordinance and not conclusive of the bill about tree registration.",113,,
690,0.97,3958.621,3959.088,Yes.,114,,
691,0.97,3959.088,3964.86,The Sepa draft is compatible with the tree provider registration.,114,,
692,0.97,3964.86,3968.764,More protections and better enforcement.,115,,
693,0.97,3968.764,3973.302,Better flexibility.,115,,
694,0.97,3973.302,3976.872,"Councilmember Peterson, do you have a question at this point?",115,,
695,0.97,3976.872,3979.275,Go for it.,115,,
696,0.97,3979.275,4006.335,"Thank you for mentioning the tree registration bill that you and I are Cosponsoring just for the public, can we clarify the schedule for the consideration and adoption of the tree service provider registration bill CB 120207.",116,,
697,0.97,4006.335,4011.807,"Thank you, chair.",117,,
698,0.97,4011.807,4013.075,I appreciate that.,117,,
699,0.97,4013.075,4017.446,I appreciate you.,118,,
700,0.97,4017.446,4019.148,Let's dive into each of these subsections.,119,,
701,0.97,4019.148,4022.485,I am excited.,119,,
702,0.97,4022.485,4031.127,The Sepa draft legislation expands the definition by lowering the threshold to 20 branches.,120,,
703,0.97,4031.127,4050.012,It adds tree [Indiscernible--Audio cutting out] with certain existing exceptional trees with thresholds smaller than 24 inches to continue to be defined as exceptional.,120,,
704,0.97,4050.012,4061.223,The smaller diameter exceptional trees from the 2008 directors rule will be part of that expanded definition.,120,,
705,0.97,4061.223,4067.83,This allows STI to regulate more trees and currently are regulated.,120,,
706,0.97,4067.83,4091.854,And so the Sepa draft includes a brand-new category not in the current tree code . significant trees are defined as any tree that has a diameter of 6 inches or greater that is not already defined as an exceptional tree.,120,,
707,0.97,4094.39,4099.662,Regulates significant trees beginning at a 6 inch threshold up to 24 inches and requires replacement for anyone that decides to remove a significant tree 12 inches or greater.,120,,
708,0.97,4099.662,4104.8,It allows removal with additional regulated significant trees.,120,,
709,0.97,4104.8,4109.038,Thank you.,121,,
710,0.97,4109.038,4123.285,And so this slide here shows the draft provides some flexibility for homebuilders to accommodate Trayvon attention.,122,,
711,0.97,4123.285,4124.053,It does this in two ways.,122,,
712,0.97,4124.053,4148.144,"For development not subject to design their view, setbacks and separation requirements can be reduced by a maximum of 50% and Amenity areas may be reduced by 10% and screening by 25% and the width, depth and Facde limits can be reduced by 10%.",122,,
713,0.97,4148.144,4148.611,Increase.,123,,
714,0.97,4148.611,4153.616,"Increase, thank you by a maximum of 10%.",124,,
715,0.97,4153.616,4167.596,And so this can help preserve existing trees especially where there is not a lot of space available for buildings and trees.,124,,
716,0.97,4167.596,4176.272,And then on the other side of this for development subject to design review it provides departures for homebuilders and also allows for reduction of parking quantity.,124,,
717,0.97,4176.272,4193.455,It also provides increasing the base site up to 50 feet which allows for additional if needed to recover the floor area lost within a tree protection area.,124,,
718,0.97,4193.455,4194.256,That is truly helpful.,125,,
719,0.97,4194.256,4196.292,Can you give me a high-level overview?,125,,
720,0.97,4196.292,4208.771,"Development not subject to design review where Single- family homes in town halls, Townhomes.",125,,
721,0.97,4208.771,4211.574,"Yes, that is correct.",126,,
722,0.97,4211.574,4217.546,Townhouses and Row houses that I showed on the previous slide.,126,,
723,0.97,4217.546,4222.384,They are not subject or are they?,127,,
724,0.97,4222.384,4225.654,Subject to design review would be things not Single- family.,128,,
725,0.97,4225.654,4232.228,So bigger and taller we were getting into the parking.,129,,
726,0.97,4232.228,4239.868,Allowing a builder to not build a couple more parking stalls to create the space to save a tree.,129,,
727,0.97,4239.868,4241.937,That is what we are talking about here.,129,,
728,0.97,4241.937,4248.944,This is so critical and I thank you so much.,129,,
729,0.97,4248.944,4260.856,"Had we pass this bill a number of years ago, the trees could've been saved because the project could've been sold with these additional aspects of flexibility.",129,,
730,0.97,4260.856,4269.265,"Because the land code was so stringent, the project could not pencil for that builder.",129,,
731,0.97,4269.265,4281.644,"When we are thinking about the homes where the tree once was, this oftentimes helps us have a Stencil and save the tree.",129,,
732,0.97,4281.644,4290.252,Lots of editorial here for me today.,130,,
733,0.97,4290.252,4294.556,The Sepa draft allows for several circumstances.,130,,
734,0.97,4294.556,4317.079,The draft director regarding payment in lieu is subject to further refinement to include city costs like establishment of new trees planted as part of mitigation at this time.,130,,
735,0.97,4319.481,4325.721,It would be to include planting of new trees citywide.,131,,
736,0.97,4325.721,4335.397,We would like to include establishment . We are looking at a time frame of 3-5 years for the new trees.,131,,
737,0.97,4335.397,4343.806,That is something that we have to keep those trees healthy.,132,,
738,0.97,4343.806,4360.389,"This is for a later conversation, I might suggest we dedicate enforcement dollars to be part of this program as well so they go back to the general fund for general use.",132,,
739,0.97,4360.389,4370.566,"I want to retrain more of our city, and I want to make sure those trees get a healthy start to their future.",132,,
740,0.97,4370.566,4382.578,The Sepa draft includes 2 news sections that strengthened the existing legislation.,133,,
741,0.97,4382.578,4391.386,Trees must be rated as extreme or high risk hazard in the assessment.,133,,
742,0.97,4391.386,4403.399,"For example, if the tree is assessed as high risk, Scci may require hazard pruning rather than the removal of the entire tree.",133,,
743,0.97,4403.399,4425.687,For emergency actions it is clear about the document requirements for fines and penalties and this draft legislation includes several new updated regulations for the tree code.,133,,
744,0.97,4427.256,4438.3,"So as far as processes and reinforcement, the last highlight I like to share with you today is the draft is SIMPLIFYING the permit review process as Sdci regulates more trees.",133,,
745,0.97,4438.3,4447.342,The Sepa draft increases the penalty amounts to help aid and the third trees from being removed in the first place.,133,,
746,0.97,4458.987,4471.333,"As far as next steps, our team is committed and looks forward to working with Stakeholders including the UFC and any work that we need to do on the potential revisions to the Sepa drafts in the weeks and months.",133,,
747,0.97,4471.333,4477.306,We will be moving forward to identify any potential at the Mentation and enforcement needs that we need to do to continue to shape this legislation.,133,,
748,0.97,4477.306,4480.742,That is really helpful.,134,,
749,0.97,4480.742,4489.785,"If somebody, the appeal window closes tomorrow.",134,,
750,0.97,4489.785,4501.864,"We will have a much better understanding of the Timeline before Ross . If there are appeals it will go back to the Examiner, and that can last a number of months.",134,,
751,0.97,4501.864,4502.831,Can you provide some more clarity?,134,,
752,0.97,4502.831,4507.169,"And if you are not the right person, I can get them from him.",134,,
753,0.97,4507.169,4509.705,I can answer that.,135,,
754,0.97,4509.705,4533.695,"The Sepa draft ordinance, it does allow for an appeal if anybody thought the decision was issued in error or we committed necessary information for the draft codes.",136,,
755,0.97,4533.695,4537.266,We would expect that any appeal of the Sepa decision would take several months to resolve.,136,,
756,0.97,4537.266,4539.268,And that is on the hearing Examiner schedule.,137,,
757,0.97,4539.268,4540.402,Yes.,138,,
758,0.97,4540.402,4560.555,"I know the hearing Examiner has a very full schedule . If somebody appeals, are they able to remove their appeal on their own accord, or is it Wednesday appeal it must go to the Examiner?",139,,
759,0.97,4560.555,4566.962,"I do not know the answer to that question, Councilmember.",140,,
760,0.97,4566.962,4572.0,. enough.,141,,
761,0.97,4572.0,4572.634,Not a problem.,142,,
762,0.97,4572.634,4577.639,I think that we have lost our counsel central staff.,143,,
763,0.97,4577.639,4583.946,Is Yolanda still with us?,143,,
764,0.97,4583.946,4586.615,I am not seeing our central staff.,143,,
765,0.97,4586.615,4588.951,We will come back to that answer.,143,,
766,0.97,4588.951,4595.39,I got a couple more questions back to the policy.,143,,
767,0.97,4595.39,4601.93,About clarifying the distinction between a 6 inch and 12 inch.,143,,
768,0.97,4601.93,4611.473,What is the function of the significant tree definition for 6 to 12 inches?,143,,
769,0.97,4611.473,4617.145,And the question comes between six and 12 inches.,143,,
770,0.97,4617.145,4623.352,The Sepa draft is a lower the threshold down to 3 inches.,144,,
771,0.97,4623.352,4635.497,That is something for replacement . We thought that was reasonable and what other cities in the region have.,144,,
772,0.97,4635.497,4638.8,I don't know if that answers your question completely.,144,,
773,0.97,4638.8,4655.917,"And then 6 inches, the reason for the 6 inches is reporting requirements start at 6 inches.",144,,
774,0.97,4655.917,4657.853,6 inches is reporting for 12 inches.,144,,
775,0.97,4657.853,4668.83,A new definition is any tree that is 6 inches and greater that is not already defined as exceptional.,145,,
776,0.97,4668.83,4672.234,We require replacement at 12.,145,,
777,0.97,4672.234,4674.603,This is new.,145,,
778,0.97,4674.603,4684.946,"The last question from me, can you help me understand the reasons for not including a comic requirement in this legislation?",146,,
779,0.97,4684.946,4688.583,Is it already in the land use code?,146,,
780,0.97,4688.583,4689.017,Yes.,147,,
781,0.97,4689.017,4692.454,I would be happy to.,147,,
782,0.97,4692.454,4702.564,Feedback including the communities do not support the requirement outside development.,147,,
783,0.97,4702.564,4709.838,That is what directed us in our draft here.,147,,
784,0.97,4709.838,4723.285,"And then, in addition to that, the tree provider registration could do that work and Councilmember Pedersen's bill.",147,,
785,0.97,4723.285,4725.52,That would be another way to do that outside development.,147,,
786,0.97,4725.52,4734.563,You do know for exceptional trees you are required a permit for significant trees as well?,148,,
787,0.97,4734.563,4737.699,"During development, yes.",149,,
788,0.97,4737.699,4749.478,What we are talking about for all of the other trees.,150,,
789,0.97,4749.478,4758.854,Those are my questions.,151,,
790,0.97,4758.854,4762.557,Do you have any other questions at this time?,151,,
791,0.97,4762.557,4766.094,Thank you.,152,,
792,0.97,4766.094,4779.508,Thank you for the presentation on the bill and I am glad that there are no conflicts with registration bill that will move forward on.,152,,
793,0.97,4779.508,4797.058,I wanted to thank everybody who called in again today and from the comment we heard from them a lot over the last years and have also sent Emails and we want them to know that I do hear their concerns.,152,,
794,0.97,4797.058,4797.359,Thank you.,152,,
795,0.97,4797.359,4803.765,"Thank you, Councilmember.",153,,
796,0.97,4803.765,4812.908,Are there any other questions or comments?,153,,
797,0.97,4812.908,4820.549,I guess we will see tomorrow if we get to take this bill up in the next month or so or if we have to wait a long time.,153,,
798,0.97,4820.549,4825.086,We will have more updates at that point.,153,,
799,0.97,4825.086,4826.021,Great.,153,,
800,0.97,4826.021,4834.696,"Colleagues, thank you for coming back with me quarterly for over two years at this point.",153,,
801,0.97,4834.696,4842.437,I really appreciate it.,153,,
802,0.97,4842.437,4853.248,"And while we don't get an appeal by tomorrow and we take this bill up, I think you will be legally believe that their duties of coming back and reporting.",153,,
803,0.97,4853.248,4856.785,It would be great to keep having you because it would be nice to hear from you once a quarter.,153,,
804,0.97,4856.785,4857.018,Great.,153,,
805,0.97,4857.018,4861.856,"Thank you, colleagues.",153,,
806,0.97,4861.856,4866.928,We will be taking up Councilmember Pedersen's tree server provider legislation on March 23 committee.,153,,
807,0.97,4866.928,4884.079,I can tell you you have heard some of my thoughts about the underlying directors roles and ordinance and I know there can be some small Tweaks made to make this a better bill.,153,,
808,0.97,4884.079,4889.551,"Shanda, Q have been trying your Darndest to get this out into the public view for so long.",153,,
809,0.97,4889.551,4898.059,I know that we have to be a little bit more about saying that.,153,,
810,0.97,4898.059,4918.58,"I know that the Mayor has not taken a position on this legislation, rather the Mayor has one Seattle vision and wants to ensure that our city staff are able to do the jobs they are required to do . that is why we are able to get this published.",153,,
811,0.97,4918.58,4926.187,"Shanda, I know that you have had to quietly give us Non- answers, and that is not your fault.",153,,
812,0.97,4926.187,4930.692,The significance of getting this draft legislation out so quickly just demonstrates already we are.,153,,
813,0.97,4930.692,4931.993,Thank you.,153,,
814,0.97,4931.993,4933.495,Thank you.,154,,
815,0.97,4933.495,4948.143,If there is no further questions--we will have that free Registry legislation at our next meeting on March 23.,155,,
816,0.97,4948.143,4961.289,"Before I conclude, I just want to share my condolences with Vincent Scott's family and also for West Sprinkly, thank you for your service on the forestry Commission.",155,,
817,0.97,4961.289,4968.963,"With that, it concludes the meeting of the land use committee.",155,,
818,0.97,4968.963,4972.434,The next meeting is Wednesday.,155,,
