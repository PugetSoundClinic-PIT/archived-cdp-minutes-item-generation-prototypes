33,0.97,265.098,286.085,"The city of Seattle has launched its first targeted effort to collect it on missing murdered indigenous people cases and these cases have been largely forgotten, not by the families, but by greater society and law enforcement, which we have been addressing for a couple of decades.",14,,
34,0.97,286.085,301.1,"In 2017, the Seattle health board urban Indian health Institute published a report titled missing murdered indigenous women and girls, detailing the crisis nationwide edit identify the city of Seattle as having more of these cases that any of the other ones in the United States.",14,,
35,0.97,301.1,304.737,That sentence does not be right.,14,,
36,0.97,304.737,326.726,"Anyway, we were responsive to this report and we were working with Abigail and Esther, we worked on this regarding missing and murdered indigenous girls and the violence against women act, things we lobbied on in Washington, D.C. and what happened in Washington, D.C.",14,,
37,0.97,326.726,344.377,Got back to our state of Washington and the city of Seattle took it upon ourselves to move forward and implement some of these policies and find them and work with local law enforcement which chief Diaz works with local tribal law enforcement as well.,14,,
38,0.97,344.377,385.184,"I am excited because this is our first Rollout to hear the presentation from SPD and the health board and I anticipate we will have a follow-up because we will not let this go, we are one of the first cities in the country to do this and we have had other cities and tribal governments to ask for our ornaments and resolutions, the fiscal notes and the background organizations and how we put this together and I was on a couple of Podcasts explaining how we work through this and we could have not done it without the Council and staff, without SPD, without Seattle Indian health board and the tribal leaders that were there for us every step of the way.",14,,

45,0.97,448.714,464.33,"I have had the privilege of learning and being educated on many of the challenges our native communities experienced and I must admit that, for many of those years, missing and murdered indigenous women and girls was not discussed as we did not know the impact being felt throughout our native Amenity.",15,,
46,0.97,464.33,470.837,To learn and understand missing and murdered indigenous women and girls have been so important to raise awareness to this human rights crisis.,15,,
47,0.97,470.837,483.683,We are thankful to the Council President Juarez for putting through the legislation and hiring a special liaison to approve data collection and taking the steps to better understand and have a better understanding of the issues.,15,,
48,0.97,483.683,504.17,"We are appreciative for the work Abigail, the chief resource officer I cannot think both of you enough for bringing awareness and ways to ensure no voices on--as an assistant chief, I work with your office in developing this project before moving into our performance Analytics action.",15,,

53,0.97,543.576,548.447,I know we have many more.,15,,
54,0.97,548.447,557.089,"It is important for Seattle to be a leader in this work and reduce further Victimization, build trust with our native communities, and develop our work so we do not have missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.",15,,
55,0.97,557.089,571.437,"I want to highlight, this is the first of its kind to have a partnership like this and I don't know another police agency in the country who has a partnership that we are developing like the one we have with Seattle Indian health board.",15,,
56,0.97,571.437,576.242,It is crucial for us to develop a five-year plan and we know we will have challenges throughout the time.,15,,
57,0.97,576.242,593.192,"Because this has never been done, we are developing the road ahead and I want to thank you and turn it over to Luis Gomez-Ventura, our data analyst, and our Coo for a further update.",15,,

72,0.97,699.965,700.366,Okay.,23,,
73,0.97,700.366,712.344,"If we have a little bit of time, interim chief Diaz, can we talk about, we started this process almost 2 years ago.",23,,
74,0.97,712.344,735.367,"And it took a while to get up and in place and do the connection with SPD and Seattle Indian health board . As we were talking yesterday and this morning, I went through the five-year contract, Deliverables, and the work that the Seattle Indian health board has put in and the staff they have dedicated to getting this done and thank you for that.",23,,
75,0.97,735.367,738.003,"We are here, great.",23,,

82,0.97,766.198,775.341,"Council President, you are right, this has been a couple of years in the making, to hire and go through a process takes a little bit of time.",29,,
83,0.97,775.341,782.248,We worked to set up a contract with Seattle Indian health board and that obviously has time.,29,,
84,0.97,782.248,785.084,But this is exciting work that we are doing.,29,,
85,0.97,785.084,807.406,"I think it highlights, as we start to get the Mmiw alert system up and running it will allow us to be more responsive to community needs and how we are reaching out when somebody is missing that is native and falls in alignment with this project.",29,,
86,0.97,807.406,829.195,"As you know, at the very beginning of the year, we had a death in the native community and I had reached out to you because, there were certain things that I was concerned about that needed to be highlighted that may be Impactful to the native community.",29,,
87,0.97,829.195,836.569,Having a program that has a full structure to this will really help bring awareness to what is going on in our native communities.,29,,
88,0.97,836.569,838.137,Thank you.,30,,
89,0.97,838.137,843.175,"Are we ready to go, Luis?",30,,

92,0.97,881.213,902.301,"A quick overview of what it is I plan on covering during this Powerpoint, hoping to do a background, Council President Juarez, thank you, and interim chief Diaz for sharing the background prior to my joining this effort and this work.",31,,
93,0.97,902.301,905.137,My background will be very brief.,31,,
94,0.97,905.137,909.808,I plan on doing a program overview.,31,,

97,0.97,934.8,953.085,"So, as was mentioned before, there has been a lot of interest in terms of being in light to ongoing concerns with missing and murdered women and girls.",31,,
98,0.97,953.085,975.507,"I will share three key points, starting in 2008, the urban Institute represented the research division of the Seattle Indian health board published a report on missing and murdered women and girls with bright light to the concerns related to Seattle on missing and murdered women and girls.",31,,
99,0.97,975.507,1001.433,"In 2019, the Seattle city council passed a resolution which made it a point to ensure that the city of Seattle was doing all they could to ensure that they were tackling and joining in bringing light to the concerns and problems of the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.",31,,
100,0.97,1001.433,1013.212,"In December of 2020, I was hired and brought on board as the missing and murdered indigenous people data analyst.",31,,
101,0.97,1013.212,1032.831,"Two key points that I want to highlight with regard to our mission and vision on the work that we are doing, I think it is very important for us to, not only tackle the aspect of understanding the scope of the data problem, but also on creating a model for collaboration.",31,,
102,0.97,1032.831,1045.21,"As part of this, our mission with regards to the Mmip program is to raise awareness and address the National data crisis as it pertains to missing and murdered indigenous people.",31,,
103,0.97,1045.21,1065.164,"As I mentioned, the vision has two points, understanding the scope of the problem and bringing light to the story of missing and murdered American Indians and Alaska native women, but also we are the first program of its kind in the nation.",31,,
104,0.97,1065.164,1069.067,"So, we hope to create a model for collaboration between agencies and organizations.",31,,
105,0.97,1069.067,1092.057,"Thus far, our collaboration has been in part with the Seattle Indian health board and I have listed the individuals from the Seattle police Department, including myself, the chief, the executive director, and our director of Pa who are assisting within the SPD on this contract.",31,,
106,0.97,1092.057,1116.582,"On the other side, with regards to the Seattle Indian health board, we have the President and Ceo, Abigail, who has done a lot of work in this area, the chief data officer, and my counterpart as the research manager for this program.",31,,
107,0.97,1116.582,1125.791,We had a couple of Deliverables with regard to my position and my contract with what it is we were hoping to tackle for your one.,31,,
108,0.97,1125.791,1152.417,"Part of the Deliverables for your one in the second quarter we had to do something matter expert discovery sessions, the second part of that was discovery phase consultation, looking and speaking with individuals who are part of this process from the data collection all the way to anything having to do with cases of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.",31,,
109,0.97,1152.417,1181.813,"Towards the end of 2021, the goal was to create a five-year plan, consultation, that would outline the work that we were hoping to accomplish in collaboration with the Seattle Indian health board and in addition tackle the data collection and recommendations which I believe the Seattle Indian health board will go into more detail about later on, these recommendations we received and are reviewing.",31,,
110,0.97,1181.813,1183.882,Can I stop you?,32,,
111,0.97,1183.882,1186.084,Can we go back?,32,,
112,0.97,1186.084,1204.136,"This was a sticking point and I learned from Abigail, and the women working on this on the National crisis, the data sharing recommendations, did--was that Synced up?",32,,
113,0.97,1204.136,1209.508,What is your expectation the same as theirs on the data collection and data sharing recommendations?,32,,
114,0.97,1209.508,1237.469,"Yes, as I mentioned, the recommendations, we received them last week and we are in the process of reviewing the recommendations and the ultimate goal in reviewing the recommendations is to have a conversation of what is the work that the Seattle Indian health board wishes to do and what SPD wishes to do . Thus far, the aspects of being sick Synced in the work we are doing has been great.",33,,
115,0.97,1237.469,1249.815,"As we review the recommendations, our goal is to get to a middle ground in the work where hoping to do as part of the data sharing and data collection aspect.",33,,
116,0.97,1249.815,1267.099,"I don't want to completely hold up the presentation but, does Christine or Shannon, is there anything you want to add, or are you saving everything for your presentation?",34,,
117,0.97,1267.099,1269.735,I think we will save it.,35,,

120,0.97,1275.24,1291.556,"A couple of things we worked on with regard to your one, first and foremost, one of the key points of our contract and the work was to create the collaboration.",37,,
121,0.97,1291.556,1303.535,Shannon came on board towards the end of quarter to and we develop that relationship in growing our collaboration.,37,,
122,0.97,1303.535,1317.516,"Part of that was establishing regular meetings and setting up ways for us to communicate and talk to each other, and answer any questions or collaborate on any work we need to do to accomplish.",37,,
123,0.97,1317.516,1327.426,We started off meeting Biweekly and we shifted to meeting weekly in order to have that ongoing conversation and communication.,37,,
124,0.97,1327.426,1342.074,"Second part of the 2021 accomplishment was doing a data orientation session, which is basically taking a look at the architecture and data discovery of the Seattle police Department and the data we have.",37,,
125,0.97,1342.074,1349.581,The first meeting we had with regards to the data discovery session happened a couple weeks after I was hired.,37,,
126,0.97,1349.581,1370.736,"It was determined, later on by mutual agreement with the Seattle Indian health board and ourselves, that we needed to go back in terms of the start of the date of the collection to be a full understanding of what exactly was happening with the aspect of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.",37,,
127,0.97,1370.736,1376.108,"We shifted our focus more to the subject matter experts, discovery session, and this was really great.",37,,
128,0.97,1376.108,1406.004,"The first session we did was with the Csdc, having Brian Smith, and administrative manager, have Shannon and myself go into the dispatch center to witness and see how a 911 call comes in from a call taker to the dispatcher to having them assign a level of urgency for all of the calls that are coming in.",37,,
129,0.97,1406.004,1415.38,This allowed us to get on the ground insight into determining how a call is coming in 2911.,37,,
130,0.97,1415.38,1422.888,"Thereafter, we saw the other aspect of a call coming in, seeing a police officer attend to one of these calls.",37,,
131,0.97,1422.888,1438.937,We had a captain take Shannon and I on the right along to hear some of the calls coming in and how they are addressing the patrol aspect of the calls coming in.,37,,
132,0.97,1438.937,1460.625,"If a call was to come in with regards to somebody missing, we shifted gears towards looking at the missing persons unit and had detective Amy LeClair guide us through the process of what it is and all the steps necessary to fully tackle aspects of a missing person's case.",37,,
133,0.97,1460.625,1484.683,Last but not least we had looked at the data elements that are needed in order for this information to be fully tracked and we have more in walk us through the platform in order for us to see how all of this information is being tracked.,37,,
134,0.97,1484.683,1489.12,What does mark 43 mean?,38,,
135,0.97,1489.12,1524.089,"That is our Database that collects all of the information from the calls that are coming in from the Dispatchers, it collects all of the information with regards to the calls and when they're coming in, what time, what patrol is attending, whether any information is being collected with regards to the use of force or patrol officer engaging into these calls.",39,,
136,0.97,1524.089,1533.031,It collects the information and we were focusing specifically on reports with regard to the missing person cases.,39,,
137,0.97,1533.031,1535.734,Mark43 is our record management system.,39,,
138,0.97,1535.734,1537.469,Thank you.,40,,
139,0.97,1537.469,1539.704,Not a problem.,41,,
140,0.97,1539.704,1561.192,"So, towards the end of Q3, we develop Workflows to fully tracked the system of when a call comes in and ultimately the end goal is to determine at what point within the process information with regard to missing and murdered indigenous women is coming in.",41,,
141,0.97,1561.192,1567.799,Shannon and myself worked on creating a dispatch Workflow which we are still in the process of completing.,41,,
142,0.97,1567.799,1574.673,"A patrol Workflow, and the missing persons Workflow.",41,,
143,0.97,1574.673,1602.067,"Some of the challenges that came up with regard to year one, this is the first of its kind with regards to the work we are doing in collaboration with community organizations, it was very important for us in the first couple of meetings that we had to fully understand the goals and objectives of the work we were doing.",41,,
144,0.97,1602.067,1614.679,Develop solid communication and collaboration to get all the work we have before us and ensure that the exploration of SPD was established.,41,,
145,0.97,1614.679,1637.202,"Part of that, with regard to the SPD and the workings, is why we went to the initial reception of a 911 call in order to follow the call from beginning to end in terms of how it is been documented.",41,,
146,0.97,1637.202,1662.761,"Next steps, for year two and beyond, as I mentioned before, we recently received the Deliverables and recommendations from the Seattle Indian health board and we are reviewing them . The Deliverables and recommendations will basically have us--or allow us to fully evaluate what it is we are hoping to accomplish in the next couple of years.",41,,
147,0.97,1662.761,1676.674,"Part of that has been enshrined that we finish some of the work that we did not get a chance to complete by the end of year one, finalizing some of the Workflows.",41,,
148,0.97,1676.674,1698.83,"Additionally, I have listed here some of the goals that SPD has in regards to the work we hope to accomplish, which is potentially launching a public data dashboard that fully shows the cases of missing and murdered indigenous women.",41,,
149,0.97,1698.83,1703.101,And potentially including some Infographics information that could be helpful to the general public.,41,,
150,0.97,1703.101,1720.285,We would also like to create some competency Learnings for SPD and we are really hoping to collaborate with these Seattle Indian health board and have them take the lead in helping us create and get with the experts in these areas.,41,,
151,0.97,1720.285,1722.554,The goal --,41,,
152,0.97,1722.554,1733.932,I will hold you up for a minute because I have some things I want to ask before we go to future Collaborations and end goals.,42,,
153,0.97,1733.932,1766.397,"This is my favorite page in your Powerpoint, because, in the beginning, I was worried, when we first put the budget request in, working with Seattle Indian health board and making sure the contract got into place and we paid attention to what was happening on the Federal and state level, for a national crisis, I was concerned, I was--this seems like this is the page we will look at to determine how we will measure success.",42,,
154,0.97,1766.397,1788.52,"The things that I really am excited about, I mean not, politicians say this all the time but I really mean is, launching the public data and dashboard so the public SEES it, which is important, and also the best classification piece, which I am guessing the Seattle Indian health board will give us more information on.",42,,
155,0.97,1788.52,1807.906,"I learned about the Misclassification and how we classify people that are missing, that we do not always acknowledge that they are indigenous women and using--working with and Leveraging tribal law enforcement and working with tribal governments in finding their people.",42,,
156,0.97,1807.906,1815.28,"On the tribal side, the best classification, we will get there in a minute, did I say that correctly?",42,,
157,0.97,1815.28,1825.523,Is that we we are going to go?,42,,
158,0.97,1825.523,1838.269,"Yes, we are collaborating with the Seattle Indian health board and the urban Indian health Institute to take a look into our data and determine whether there is any Misclassification.",43,,
159,0.97,1838.269,1853.751,The goal is to do an analysis of our data to make sure that we are not misclassified any individuals that go missing or are murdered within our Database.,43,,
160,0.97,1853.751,1862.861,"Specifically, we are focusing on the data with us to determine if there were problems.",43,,
161,0.97,1862.861,1893.858,"The launching of the Website--the dashboard is important because it will have the data, but just the Website, the Website has allowed us to talk about this, we did not have a media platform to put up pictures and we have been provided the space to reach out.",44,,
162,0.97,1893.858,1904.102,"I am guessing that, when you work with Seattle Indian health board, and we do have a missing, murdered indigenous personal Website.",44,,
163,0.97,1904.102,1906.371,I keep having these questions.,44,,
164,0.97,1906.371,1917.749,"That we shared the Website and take input from you--I know we talked about this, from local tribal law enforcement and their social services.",44,,
165,0.97,1917.749,1940.672,"I don't want to see you Sideload off your only contact with Indian country is the Seattle Indian health board, there is nothing wrong with that but the whole point, to address a national issue, in Indian country, with people missing, we don't distinguish between city limits and state lines, for that matter, Canada and the United States.",44,,
166,0.97,1940.672,1945.209,I will push hard on that.,44,,
167,0.97,1945.209,1947.745,"Go ahead, Esther.",44,,
168,0.97,1947.745,1963.428,"The one question I have, is your Misclassification analysis project going to include a forensic review of Mmip cases?",45,,
169,0.97,1963.428,1966.664,We do not have the capacity for that.,45,,
170,0.97,1966.664,1973.137,"Yes, definitely, that is included within our Misclassification analysis project.",46,,
171,0.97,1973.137,1982.28,I did want to answer some of the concerns that Council President Trent he was mentioning in regards to the collaboration.,46,,
172,0.97,1982.28,2021.753,"I don't want to jump ahead, I believe the Seattle Indian health board will be presenting on the recommendations, but the overview I have done thus far with regards to the recommendations they have shared, it is within the recommendations to collaborate with some of the other tribal agencies and organizations and that is definitely something on our list in terms of what to do to go in the direction we are hoping, specifically in regards to the Mmip Website and that is something we want to collaborate on . to I have news for you, I will take the show on the road, you will go with us, so get ready for that.",46,,
173,0.97,2021.753,2023.554,I am ready to go.,47,,
174,0.97,2023.554,2025.623,I will let you finish.,48,,
175,0.97,2025.623,2031.095,"As I mentioned, that is our ultimate end goal.",49,,
176,0.97,2031.095,2049.547,"The only other thing I had, there is a lot of light on--there has been light on the ongoing data crisis that within the last couple of years, there has been more light on this.",49,,
177,0.97,2049.547,2097.328,"There has been a push, from not just the city of Seattle, but the state as a whole, to work in collaboration with some of the potential problems that are stemming from, whether Misclassification or just the resources available for indigenous people, and some of the aspects I have had here with regard to future collaboration is we are hoping to see where we fit in terms of the Washington state alert system with missing and murdered indigenous people and Washington state created the Washington state missing and murdered indigenous women and people task force that we are hoping to team up and partner with on the work we are doing for us not to be Duplicating the work.",49,,
178,0.97,2097.328,2107.305,"Last but not least, working closely in collaboration with the indigenous advisor Council liaison for the city of Seattle.",49,,
179,0.97,2107.305,2126.924,We are excited for the work that is ahead of us and excited to look into the recommendations that the Seattle Indian health board shared with us to see what is the remainder of the contract has in store for us.,49,,
180,0.97,2126.924,2134.465,"On the advisory Council, I read you are talking about Francesca?",50,,
181,0.97,2134.465,2134.899,Yes.,51,,
182,0.97,2134.899,2154.118,I had a couple of calls with her and we are in the process of determining--I know Shannon has been in contact with Francesca and we are trying to get on a call and determine how to move forward.,51,,
183,0.97,2154.118,2196.193,"Include our policy person on that, and I hope Francesca is listening, she is amazing, she was an employee at Seattle Indian health board and they trained her well, then she came here and she is the linchpin holding together the advisory Council and she and the Department of neighborhoods can have a collective group of people representative of this region that will advise him of not only the legislative branch of government, but the Executie branch as well, and the Mayor hired the former Councilmember and having Tim and Francesca has made my job 90% easier.",52,,
184,0.97,2196.193,2203.901,We have a great team of people and were anxious to welcome you and work with you in Indian country.,52,,
185,0.97,2203.901,2204.268,Definitely.,53,,
186,0.97,2204.268,2211.442,We have been excited and Brainstorming on determining how we fit in with all of this work that is happening.,53,,
187,0.97,2211.442,2233.197,I think we feel the support and no longer feel like it is us who are the only ones working on this and we are excited to grow our team in collaboration with regards to the crisis.,53,,
188,0.97,2233.197,2245.776,"Chief Diaz, do you want to wrap up, that I will turn it over to Esther.",54,,
189,0.97,2245.776,2248.946,Do you have any closing statements?,54,,
190,0.97,2248.946,2252.883,"No, I think we said all we want to say.",55,,
191,0.97,2252.883,2254.685,This is the first of its kind.,55,,
192,0.97,2254.685,2267.465,"We will have challenges throughout the building of the program but I'm excited for the partnerships and Collaborations, and for us to build trust within the native community.",55,,
193,0.97,2267.465,2268.966,This is that kind of starting process.,55,,
194,0.97,2268.966,2273.404,I will turn it over to the executive director.,55,,
195,0.97,2273.404,2276.207,Before we do that.,56,,
196,0.97,2276.207,2306.737,"I want to say that, you are the first person in law enforcement, we would have our conversations early on, you said it again this morning on your own, I am glad you said what you said, that missing murdered indigenous women and girls is a human rights issue and you have been saying that, you said that privately to me, publicly today, this is the city response to a national crisis and I want to thank you for the words.",56,,
197,0.97,2306.737,2313.21,It Contextualizes it and puts it in a narrative that people understand that this is happening today and I thank you.,56,,
198,0.97,2313.21,2315.713,Thank you.,57,,
199,0.97,2315.713,2321.185,Ms. Lucero.,58,,
200,0.97,2321.185,2331.829,"Chief Diaz, good to see your face, I remember our first meeting on this when we were trying to write the job description.",59,,
201,0.97,2331.829,2343.207,"Chief, we will have to have a conversation with city council around budgeting for the future related to this as I am thinking about resources we have allocated and you have utilized.",59,,
202,0.97,2343.207,2345.309,We will have that discussion moving forward.,59,,
203,0.97,2345.309,2367.331,"I would like to give tremendous gratitude to our team, Shannon has been our research manager and leading the effort in dedicating her time, Adrian Dominguez has been overseeing her work and that allows Abigail and I to do our work to educate the public and bring in vital resources to support the initiatives.",59,,
204,0.97,2367.331,2370.267,Christina Diego is our policy program manager and she is brilliant.,59,,
205,0.97,2370.267,2384.148,"We are lucky we have double brilliance since you took Francesca from me, Councilmember Juarez, and we will continue to really build and strengthen our need of policy people.",59,,
206,0.97,2384.148,2395.693,I will head over to Christina Diego and we can have a good discussion.,59,,
207,0.97,2395.693,2396.093,Christina?,60,,
208,0.97,2396.093,2400.164,"Hello, everyone, thank you for the introduction.",61,,
209,0.97,2400.164,2426.791,"My name is Christina Diego and I am a policy program director with the Seattle Indian health board, I am here today with the research manager of the urban Indian health Institute who laid the groundwork for the resolution in the first year, and with the President and Ceo of the Seattle Indian health board.",61,,
210,0.97,2426.791,2431.262,I would like to thank city Councilmembers and the Governance of native communities and tribal Governance Committee for holding this meeting today.,61,,
211,0.97,2431.262,2438.736,I would like to emphasize that the presentation today focuses on American Indian and Alaska native populations.,61,,
212,0.97,2438.736,2450.848,"As part of our research, we recognize data collection practices and local efforts, that they must continue to serve the unique needs of each indigenous population.",61,,
213,0.97,2450.848,2468.766,"In the first year, the urban Indian health Institute assess the Seattle police Department's workload in identifying missing persons by observing the data collection processes from 911 emergency call Initiations to missing persons detective follow-up investigations.",61,,
214,0.97,2468.766,2483.881,"Because of the limited time, we focused on how Seattle police processed missing person cases and in the second year we will observe how Seattle police Department processes the murder cases in relation to American Indian and Alaska native people.",61,,
215,0.97,2483.881,2502.266,"Our observations can support recommendations for Seattle police Department to include the data collection practices and investigation policies to more accurately capture the missing and murdered indigenous women and people crisis through policies, processes, and interventions.",61,,
216,0.97,2502.266,2509.206,The urban Indian health Institute worked with the King County prosecuting office to improve the accuracy of data collected on American Indian and Alaska native people.,61,,
217,0.97,2509.206,2526.957,"The study offers recommendations to update the databases with fields for race, Ethnicity, tribal affiliation, and our work with King County has brought national attention to the Department of justice and the FBI I can be Replicated with the Seattle police Department.",61,,
218,0.97,2526.957,2539.703,"Our work I had recommends five targeted areas for the Seattle police Department which includes improving the data collection methods, practices, processes.",61,,
219,0.97,2539.703,2553.217,"We would like to recommend that they ensure American Indian, race, Ethnicity are being accurately captured from our observations, there is a lack of standardizing American Indian and Alaska native race and Ethnicity within the protocols.",61,,
220,0.97,2553.217,2561.892,We would like to recommend that the collect self identified race and Ethnicity of missing and murdered indigenous people.,61,,
221,0.97,2561.892,2577.708,The current community safety and to medication center and Seattle police Department data collection processes rely on college perceptions of the individual and this significantly Erases the race and Ethnicity that the individual identifies as.,61,,
222,0.97,2577.708,2584.782,We would also like to make sure the collection and analysis of multiple race and Ethnicity categories.,61,,
223,0.97,2584.782,2590.254,American Indian and Alaska native people are the fastest growing Multiracial population across the nation.,61,,
224,0.97,2590.254,2602.266,Current community safety and communication center and the Seattle police Department data collection processes do not allow callers to describe individuals as Multiracial which is an issue that needs to be fixed.,61,,
225,0.97,2602.266,2610.941,"We want to recommend that the tribal affiliation, when appropriate be given, as tribal consultation and urban comfort processes.",61,,
226,0.97,2610.941,2618.749,We would also like to recommend that they conduct a forensic review of missing and murdered indigenous women and people.,61,,
227,0.97,2618.749,2629.193,"From the urban Indian health Institute report, we know that missing and murdered indigenous women is very high in Seattle.",61,,
228,0.97,2629.193,2634.932,"To correct this, we need to conduct a forensic audit to correct cases of racial Misclassification.",61,,
229,0.97,2634.932,2645.743,We also like to recommend they develop a system that says it in plain language.,61,,
230,0.97,2645.743,2655.853,This is important and we found the Seattle police Department does not have a Codebook that explains data elements which is critical for ensuring proper data collection analysis and quality.,61,,
231,0.97,2655.853,2666.664,"We would like them to improve training for the Seattle police department by providing training on best practices for collecting and Inputting data, this is important for us to standardize a process across the agency.",61,,
232,0.97,2666.664,2677.741,We would like them to provide training related to American Indian and Alaska native communities for missing and murdered indigenous women and people in crisis and cultural humility.,61,,
233,0.97,2677.741,2686.35,We would like to review existing Trainings to increase compassion and empathy among Seattle police Department.,61,,
234,0.97,2686.35,2695.859,"The next key area, we would like to observe Nonemergency call takers to improve the collection of race Ethnicity and tribal affiliation.",61,,
235,0.97,2695.859,2716.613,We also recommend conducting observations of Nonemergency calls to increase the awareness of missing person investigation processes to support community members related to missing and murdered indigenous women.,61,,
236,0.97,2716.613,2726.49,"In the last section, we want them to develop a unit manual to set communication standards between the missing person detective, recording parties, tribal nations when appropriate.",61,,
237,0.97,2726.49,2734.865,Currently but there is no unit manual that Standardizes communication expectations which is important for improving communication with our community members.,61,,
238,0.97,2734.865,2743.574,"Lastly, we want to recommend the clarify investigation expectations of patrol officers and the missing person detective across Seattle police Department.",61,,
239,0.97,2743.574,2754.184,This will clarify data collection practices and support while the insurance to properly document American Indian and Alaska native individuals impacted by missing and murdered indigenous women and people.,61,,
240,0.97,2754.184,2765.596,"To support our efforts on the resolution, we would like to request the city indigenous advisory Council host our urban confer to discuss the reporting and collection of tribal related data.",61,,
241,0.97,2765.596,2785.916,"As an urban Indian organization, we recognize the efforts to improve data collection practices on tribal members and that must be informed by local tribes, American Indian and Alaska native community members, native leaders, and other indigenous led organizations in the presence of the Seattle police Department.",61,,
242,0.97,2785.916,2794.458,"We look forward to our continued work in supporting survivors, victims, families affected by the missing and murdered indigenous women and people crisis.",61,,
243,0.97,2794.458,2795.392,Thank you.,61,,
244,0.97,2795.392,2800.097,Thank you.,62,,
245,0.97,2800.097,2818.048,"I have a few questions I want to ask but I want to go back, if there is anything you, Esther, want to ask.",62,,
246,0.97,2818.048,2832.462,"No, I'll report you can work from and I want to reiterate that we are not just doing this to solve some local challenges and inform the state, we are trying to build a system which can be duplicated across the nation to address this.",63,,
247,0.97,2832.462,2837.668,"I want to make sure that, as we continue into this work, we keep that in mind.",63,,
248,0.97,2837.668,2845.209,"We will have to be Innovated and challenge systems, and we need to work in tandem to make that happen.",63,,
249,0.97,2845.209,2869.233,"I will go back to you, Christina, you are moving pretty quickly, you were working with the King County Prosecutor, an individual you were working with, do you have the same relationship with the city attorney and her staff?",64,,
250,0.97,2869.233,2877.941,"Because local Seattle police, are you developing that relationship as well?",64,,
251,0.97,2877.941,2880.043,"Yes, I would say we are developing that relationship.",65,,
252,0.97,2880.043,2890.254,"With the King County prosecuting attorney's office, they reached out to us after seeing the work we were able to do.",65,,
253,0.97,2890.254,2893.09,We were happy to start working on a resolution with the Seattle police Department.,65,,
254,0.97,2893.09,2909.406,"On our to do list, my staff is taking notes, we want to talk off-line about the connection between King County prosecutors and you folks, and help the relationship between the city attorney's office and you as well.",66,,
255,0.97,2909.406,2911.608,I think that is very important.,66,,
256,0.97,2911.608,2934.231,"The question I want to address to the chief and Luis, within SPD, do you have, I think they do with the sheriff, is there some mechanism in which SPD works with tribal governments and tribal law enforcement?",66,,
257,0.97,2934.231,2935.766,That is a big issue for us.,66,,
258,0.97,2935.766,2940.27,We do.,67,,
259,0.97,2940.27,2942.739,It is usually on very specific cases.,67,,
260,0.97,2942.739,2966.096,"Typically, if there is somewhere there is a missing case, a detective from the tribal police may reach out to our defective if there is communication gaps that sometimes--it goes up to a higher level, sometimes the lieutenants and captains are involved.",67,,
261,0.97,2966.096,2978.442,"Typically, we use it on an individual basis and it is not necessarily uniform across where we are reaching out to the tribal police even when there is no case is Inexistent.",67,,
262,0.97,2978.442,2997.194,"That underscores the problem I have seen over 30 years as a lawyer in Indian country in dealing with prosecutors and U.S. attorneys, the Department of justice, I will push hard on recommendations I think are important.",68,,
263,0.97,2997.194,3023.253,"We need some kind of goal in connecting with the King County Prosecutor's office and city attorney's office, we need, on the SPD side, a more formalized approach, that there is somebody at SPD, I know that their job--they are in connection in speaking with and providing information to tribal governments, at least locally, and also to tribal law enforcement.",68,,
264,0.97,3023.253,3032.996,"We know a lot of the Chiefs of police for different tribes, but should be reliant on personal relationships.",68,,
265,0.97,3032.996,3035.932,We talked about that yesterday.,68,,
266,0.97,3035.932,3045.509,"I want to see that before I leave office, and Institutionalization of that because Leveraging Indian country is phenomenal when you see the resources that are available.",68,,
267,0.97,3045.509,3069.8,"Tribal governments are like any other government, they have hospitals and jails, police, they do everything a city does and what I do not see the Non- Union areas do is Leveraging the resources to find and do other things, but more importantly, for the mission in front of us today, find and identify missing, murdered indigenous people.",68,,
268,0.97,3069.8,3077.007,"I don't like being the city that has the most number of missing, murdered indigenous women and girls, I think it is 71 or 72.",68,,
269,0.97,3077.007,3085.182,That is not something I like to brag about with my colleagues in other cities.,68,,
270,0.97,3085.182,3096.293,"So, chief Diaz, I am hoping you and I, at least on the legislative SPD level, I will speak with the Mayor as well, that is very much needed.",68,,
271,0.97,3096.293,3112.676,"People do acknowledgments all the time, thank you, but what I really want a really good, policies, this would be one of them, to have SPD Online with tribal governments and tribal law enforcement, I think that would go a long way.",68,,
272,0.97,3112.676,3132.395,"I would also like to reiterate that tribes are deemed public health authorities as well and, from a data perspective, we have a different tiered responsibility with the and the ways we define our data sharing agreements with the tribes and our responsibility to report accurate data to the tribes is going to be really key.",69,,
273,0.97,3132.395,3144.541,I am glad you keep bringing up King County Prosecutor's office because that will be the key to the success of this overall transformation.,69,,
274,0.97,3144.541,3158.922,"Abigail and I are happy to do anything we can to make sure that those relationships are established beyond the personal relationships that you have now, and help create any of the structure a system that is sustainable.",69,,
275,0.97,3158.922,3170.6,"We should use as an example, this was 30 years ago, we push hard for the U.S. attorney to have a native American assistant U.S. attorney and we have one now.",70,,
276,0.97,3170.6,3185.015,"There are jurisdictional issues and Federal crimes, there is a jurisdictional issue whether or not local law enforcement can go on a reservation with Federal law and we have no Federal Prosecutor, U.S.",70,,
277,0.97,3185.015,3192.589,"Attorney, that understood Indian law that could do that, now we do and I think he is still there, I am hoping he is still there.",70,,
278,0.97,3192.589,3199.896,That was a long time coming and I want to see the county and the city Replicate that.,70,,
279,0.97,3199.896,3205.202,That is something I have been working on for over 30 years and hopefully it will happen.,70,,
280,0.97,3205.202,3208.738,"Okay, go ahead.",70,,
281,0.97,3208.738,3211.208,One last thing.,71,,
282,0.97,3211.208,3220.35,Sometimes we see systems created and there are no systems of accountability that accompany that creation.,71,,
283,0.97,3220.35,3222.385,I want to make sure we think about that.,71,,
284,0.97,3222.385,3224.421,That there are rules.,71,,
285,0.97,3224.421,3229.492,And there are consequences to not abiding by the new systems we develop.,71,,
286,0.97,3229.492,3239.869,That is something we have seen at the state level and at the national level where people do not follow through and there are no consequences to that.,71,,
287,0.97,3239.869,3243.74,I want to keep that on our minds.,71,,
288,0.97,3243.74,3249.212,We have a lot of work to do and we will have another presentation before the August break.,72,,
289,0.97,3249.212,3275.238,"Luis and team just got the recommendations from the Indian health board and we will meet again, the chief and I will meet again, Luis and I will meet again, and I will have stronger recommendations we can deliver on the legislative site and we get the advisory Council Online, that will be a chief issue to deal with for them, how we work and collaborate.",72,,
290,0.97,3275.238,3283.079,"Knowing what the Deliverables are, how do we measure success, and we hold people accountable.",72,,
291,0.97,3283.079,3283.28,Okay.,72,,
292,0.97,3283.28,3292.255,Does anyone have anything else on this topic before we move on?,72,,
293,0.97,3292.255,3295.692,You good?,72,,
294,0.97,3295.692,3298.561,"I am good, thank you.",73,,
295,0.97,3298.561,3304.868,I want to thank chief Diaz and Luis Gomez.,74,,
296,0.97,3304.868,3309.205,Nice meeting you and finally seeing your face.,74,,
297,0.97,3309.205,3310.74,"Thank you, Christine.",74,,
298,0.97,3310.74,3315.011,We did not have Shannon here.,74,,
299,0.97,3315.011,3320.684,She is here but we just cannot see her face.,75,,
300,0.97,3320.684,3326.189,Don't know if you can share your face.,75,,
301,0.97,3326.189,3328.291,There you are.,76,,
302,0.97,3328.291,3328.625,"Hi, Shannon.",76,,
303,0.97,3328.625,3329.859,Thank you for being here.,76,,
304,0.97,3329.859,3333.53,I see your name on everything.,76,,
305,0.97,3333.53,3336.266,I know how hard you work.,76,,
306,0.97,3336.266,3341.204,"Thank you, Esther, for the hard work.",76,,
307,0.97,3341.204,3345.108,"Councilmember Mosqueda, anything you want to share?",76,,
308,0.97,3345.108,3350.413,Thank you for so much doing this.,77,,
309,0.97,3350.413,3358.355,"I am very excited about this presentation, knowing it has been years in the works.",77,,
310,0.97,3358.355,3373.803,I wondered if there was any emphasis or movement in the recommendations that you think will be forthcoming to have something that could be used across the state or the nation like we have with the amber alert for the silver alert?,77,,
311,0.97,3373.803,3386.483,I did not note that we have the highest number of murdered and missing indigenous women and girls in comparison to other larger cities.,77,,
312,0.97,3386.483,3401.097,"If this is groundbreaking for us to have this approach already, something like an alert system on our phones could bring more attention to the issue and hopefully save lives and more resolutions to the cases.",77,,
313,0.97,3401.097,3412.509,I am sure that would take resources and I,77,,
314,0.97,3415.745,3423.953,"I might note to Councilmember Mosqueda, that is HB 1725 on the alert system.",78,,
315,0.97,3423.953,3431.394,That's one of the things we are working on with the policy of it.,78,,
316,0.97,3431.394,3436.032,The alert will also be noted as well.,78,,
317,0.97,3436.032,3445.241,Once we have an alert system we can then notify state patrol and that's how it goes out statewide.,78,,
318,0.97,3445.241,3446.543,We are working with them as well.,78,,
319,0.97,3446.543,3449.078,We don't need to pilot something sooner than the state plan.,79,,
320,0.97,3449.078,3454.184,We are just incorporating the policy right now.,80,,
321,0.97,3454.184,3456.252,That way we are trained up and ready to implement.,80,,
322,0.97,3456.252,3456.619,Okay.,81,,
323,0.97,3456.619,3460.557,Thank you for all of the recommendations forthcoming.,81,,
324,0.97,3460.557,3461.424,Thank you guys.,82,,

332,0.97,3481.544,3487.15,"Agenda items two and three, appointment 02209 and appointment 02210.",89,,

338,0.97,3517.947,3519.015,Thank you very much.,91,,

340,0.97,3520.683,3531.561,I'm the senior policy advisor at the office of labor standards and I was commissioned onto the Advisory Commission.,91,,
341,0.97,3531.561,3538.334,We serve a very valuable advisory function for the office and to the city council as well.,91,,
342,0.97,3538.334,3549.679,"It's unique in that it brings together business owners, business advocates, workers, worker advocates, and community members to provide advancing labor standards in Seattle.",91,,
343,0.97,3549.679,3562.258,We have advised city policies on Ordnance as well as providing guidance with numerous outreach policy providers for the city.,91,,
344,0.97,3562.258,3570.633,There is a wide range of backgrounds for improving workplace conditions for workers and ensuring that we have the tools to comply with labor standards.,91,,
345,0.97,3570.633,3581.811,As this committee knows well Seattle is not merely advancing best practices for labor standards but creating them.,91,,
346,0.97,3581.811,3585.548,And the two appointees here today are going to be key voices in that conversation.,91,,
347,0.97,3585.548,3602.265,I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to work with the two appointees . I'm going to introduce Danielle at this point and then Dustin in a couple of minutes.,91,,

352,0.97,3629.192,3637.0,The past three years she has worked at the fair works center and has partnered with Ols through the outreach and education funding program.,91,,
353,0.97,3637.0,3644.874,"That is just a very brief window of many, many of the things that she has done.",91,,
354,0.97,3644.874,3647.343,I hope that she will say a few more words.,91,,
355,0.97,3647.343,3653.216,I look forward to working with Danielle.,91,,
356,0.97,3653.216,3653.816,Especially with Lsac.,91,,

358,0.97,3658.187,3660.256,We have seen all kinds of stuff about you.,92,,
359,0.97,3660.256,3662.592,Why don't you go ahead and share with us today?,92,,
360,0.97,3662.592,3671.401,I see that you both graduated from Whitman college but Dustin did not put down which year he graduated.,92,,
361,0.97,3671.401,3672.802,But you did.,92,,
362,0.97,3672.802,3675.304,Pretty soon I may start taking that NOTE from Dustin.,93,,

366,0.97,3683.012,3694.891,"In addition to some of the things I have worked on I want to say, and I'm sure many of us have this personal connection to this issue and to the work that Lsac is involved in.",93,,
367,0.97,3694.891,3699.195,I have a lot of family members.,93,,

369,0.97,3705.835,3713.943,As someone who has benefited from the labor standards I want to say this is a great opportunity for me to make sure we continue to lead in Seattle.,93,,
370,0.97,3713.943,3720.383,"Like Kerem mentioned, one of the skill SETS I bring is working as a legal aid attorney.",93,,
371,0.97,3720.383,3734.03,Working with low income clients understand the barriers people face with poorly set up structures.,93,,
372,0.97,3734.03,3735.932,We want to make sure everything is accessible to people.,93,,
373,0.97,3735.932,3736.966,Something I'm very passionate about.,93,,
374,0.97,3736.966,3744.407,It's unfortunate that in my current organization we work close with Ols.,93,,
375,0.97,3744.407,3749.078,"Relying on individual worker issues, supporting domestic worker standards board, thinking about implementation of some of the ordinances that we have recently passed.",93,,
376,0.97,3749.078,3752.148,That is really helpful insight for us.,93,,
377,0.97,3752.148,3767.997,"Going forward, how do we continue to build on the successes we have had so far, in particular an equitable recovery from the pandemic . We want to have an economy that is thriving for everybody and not leaving immigrants, people of color, and women behind.",93,,
378,0.97,3767.997,3769.599,I think there's a lot of opportunities.,93,,
379,0.97,3769.599,3777.807,"There are so many things in the works right now that the Council, the Mayor, and Ols already talked about.",93,,
380,0.97,3777.807,3807.503,"I will provide some of that implementation expertise, the insight into what low income communities and workers need in order to make sure everything is accessible to them and making sure that racial justice and equity is centered in our thoughts about what comes next for us in terms of economic development and workplace protections.",93,,
381,0.97,3807.503,3811.007,There's so much that we have done in Seattle and we are proud of that work.,93,,

392,0.97,3835.231,3836.899,How do you want to do it?,96,,
393,0.97,3836.899,3838.134,I will defer to you.,97,,

396,0.97,3842.605,3843.506,Introduce Dustin.,98,,
397,0.97,3843.506,3853.883,We have some questions and we can open the floor to my colleagues to ask questions both of you.,98,,
398,0.97,3853.883,3867.063,"Dustin, like Danielle, has so much experience it's hard to introduce him sufficiently here.",99,,
399,0.97,3867.063,3870.433,He has over a decade of experience working on Seattle labor standards.,99,,
400,0.97,3870.433,3872.568,Resource and leadership at King County labor Council and U.S.,99,,
401,0.97,3872.568,3873.035,Cw 3000.,99,,
402,0.97,3873.035,3884.78,"He has been a voice in the policy conversation around labor standards for really every labor standard our office enforces, going back to before our office even existed.",99,,
403,0.97,3884.78,3892.622,I personally worked with Dustin on issues around the groundbreaking work for Huber and lift drivers.,99,,
404,0.97,3892.622,3901.197,And continue conversations around the forthcoming Cannabis equity policy.,99,,
405,0.97,3901.197,3907.069,I look forward to the opportunity to work with them in this new role.,99,,
406,0.97,3907.069,3912.508,Great.,100,,

414,0.97,3944.373,3953.716,Particularly how we have created a spot for other places across the country.,101,,
415,0.97,3953.716,3956.752,I'm excited for the work on Cannabis that I am doing right now.,101,,
416,0.97,3956.752,3971.567,"Although it wouldn't be necessarily a model, since other cities in the West Coast are already doing much of it, I'm excited about continuing to partner with you all as we advance that forward.",101,,
417,0.97,3971.567,3977.273,I would love to continue doing labor standards work with some other colleagues that are already on.,101,,
418,0.97,3977.273,3991.854,"The labor standards advisory Commission, as well as with Danielle, I would love to have your support here as you deliberate about whether Danielle or I can be appointed to the committee.",101,,

427,0.97,4094.023,4098.461,I know that both of you have been working on a lot of these issues and you are also very collaborative.,103,,
428,0.97,4098.461,4103.499,I like that you understand business and you work with elected officials and you are pragmatic and have common sense.,103,,
429,0.97,4103.499,4114.009,"And you know from your work on the $15 minimum wage, and the other Union issues, that consensus has to be made to move forward.",103,,
430,0.97,4114.009,4116.178,And you continue to move forward.,103,,
431,0.97,4116.178,4124.787,"With Danielle's background in legal, looking at your resume, obviously you understand how you move these kind of issues forward.",103,,
432,0.97,4124.787,4128.657,They don't happen overnight.,103,,
433,0.97,4128.657,4131.46,"Just because people chance, I want it now, that's not how it works.",103,,
434,0.97,4131.46,4134.396,"Dustin, I have known you for years.",103,,
