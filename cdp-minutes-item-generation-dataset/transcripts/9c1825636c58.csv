128,0.97,661.427,664.23,Agenda item 2. CB 120015.,28,,
129,0.97,664.23,676.876,"An ordinance relating to the city light Department; amending rates, terms, and conditions for the use and sale of electricity supplied by the city light Department for 2021 and 2022; amending sections 21.49.030, 21.49.052, 21.49.055, 21.49.057, 21.49.058, and 21.49.060 of the Seattle municipal code; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.",28,,
130,0.97,676.876,680.613,For briefing discussion and possible vote.,28,,
131,0.97,680.613,683.082,Thank you.,29,,
132,0.97,683.082,688.187,I appreciate that we still have city light here to discuss this and I'm sure we will have more discussion on this one.,29,,
133,0.97,688.187,690.156,And Eric Mcconaghy as well.,29,,
134,0.97,690.156,700.866,"I appreciate both Seattle city light and Seattle public utilities, the municipally owned enterprise focusing on Affordability for city residents.",29,,
135,0.97,700.866,719.985,"The ordinance before us today I believe balances the commitment to balancing that customers with stability, and the announcement of the electric bills, while enabling to recover from financial impacts of the pandemic over the next couple of years.",29,,
136,0.97,719.985,721.821,"In the present form, it would take two actions.",29,,
137,0.97,721.821,730.229,"On April 1st, it would use the existing rate stabilization account surcharge to maintain a base rate.",29,,
138,0.97,730.229,735.701,There should be no impact customer bills for 2021.,29,,
139,0.97,735.701,759.325,"The next item that the bill does, it deals with the 2022 rate and keeps the promise made in 2018 to increase rates of 2022, I not more than 3.9%, with the expectation that it is much as 1.5% might be offset by a lower Pass-Through rate reduction.",29,,
140,0.97,759.325,764.63,In 2022 it is possible that the rate increase would be as low as 2.4%.,29,,
141,0.97,764.63,771.837,I know some of us share a valid concern that we would like a bit more time to affirm that 2022 rate information.,29,,
142,0.97,771.837,782.648,"Even though the action for 2022 would be consistent with or better than the previous plan approved in 2018, it would be ideal to give everybody more time to Acclimate to the information.",29,,
143,0.97,782.648,793.092,"I, at the very least would be open to having this delayed to the April 29th full city Council, rather than going to April 22nd full council.",29,,
144,0.97,793.092,795.561,We can discuss that as we hear more about the item.,29,,
145,0.97,795.561,797.797,Did you mean March 22nd?,30,,
146,0.97,797.797,800.065,And March 29?,30,,
147,0.97,800.065,801.0,Yes.,31,,
148,0.97,801.0,805.704,"March 22nd, March 29th.",31,,
149,0.97,805.704,811.51,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,31,,
150,0.97,811.51,822.588,We'll talk about the data in A█ minute and I am really pleased that Seattle city light has been taking action that will note the increase in customer bills this year.,31,,
151,0.97,822.588,829.328,And to keep the promise for next year.,31,,
152,0.97,829.328,833.132,"55, I know you have been looking at this thoroughly for all of the city council members.",31,,
153,0.97,833.132,837.736,Feel free to let us know your thoughts on this and thank you for your thorough memo on this.,31,,
154,0.97,837.736,841.841,Then we will hear from city light and Council members.,31,,
155,0.97,841.841,843.642,Thank you very much.,32,,
156,0.97,843.642,864.93,"Just by adding a little bit of context and framing, to reiterate, chair, forgive me for reiterating a little bit but to be clear, the bill would set the rates in the Seattle municipal code for Seattle city light effective April 1 of 2021, that is a 3% change to what the rate is now.",32,,
157,0.97,864.93,872.171,It will also set the rates beginning January 1 of 2022.,32,,
158,0.97,872.171,872.738,Of 3.9%.,32,,
159,0.97,872.738,886.285,"That is across all of the rate schedules, there is a table that shows rates for each class of customer at the city light service.",32,,
160,0.97,886.285,900.699,"These rates, as you mentioned, in the bill, are slightly lower for 2021 and then the same for 2022 as the rates that the Council endorsed when the Council adopted city lights 2019 through 2021 strategic plan.",32,,
161,0.97,900.699,911.61,And as you mentioned the proposal would increase the 2021 rates at the same time as city light will be removing the current rates stabilization account surcharges from customer's bills.,32,,
162,0.97,911.61,920.619,The rate stabilization account is a way for city light to have a buffer against changes in wholesale revenue.,32,,
163,0.97,920.619,932.531,"Wholesale revenue is the power Úthat is not sold to retail customers, folks like myself, who live within the service area for city light to purchase power.",32,,
164,0.97,932.531,934.366,"It is power that is sold to other providers, utilities.",32,,
165,0.97,934.366,938.637,"It is an important resource, revenue source for city light.",32,,
166,0.97,938.637,942.141,And it was put in the code a couple years ago to observe fluctuations in that.,32,,
167,0.97,942.141,954.053,"When the Rsa, the rate stabilization account drops below certain thresholds in its balance, the surcharges automatically are placed on the bills.",32,,
168,0.97,954.053,958.257,That is at City light taking action to do that.,32,,
169,0.97,958.257,968.634,"And Conversely, when the balance to the Rsa is big enough, then city light removes the surcharges and Council does not have to take action on this.",32,,
170,0.97,968.634,973.272,It is all called for and authorized in the city code.,32,,
171,0.97,973.272,989.288,"Because of the balances in the Rsa currently, city light expects to move the 3% surcharge from customer's bills, as soon as April billing based on conversations we have had an timing that is set in this proposal.",32,,
172,0.97,989.288,991.056,In this Council bill.,32,,
173,0.97,991.056,998.197,"And just to reiterate, this does not--surcharge.",32,,
174,0.97,998.197,1003.769,Without any action then the customer bills would be lower when the surcharges removed.,32,,
175,0.97,1003.769,1010.175,"Once again, the proposal is Crafted to result in no net increase of overall cost to city light customers.",32,,
176,0.97,1010.175,1010.609,In 2021.,32,,
177,0.97,1010.609,1017.182,By balancing those two changes.,32,,
178,0.97,1017.182,1028.827,"Strategic planning, typically, council would consider the adoption of new retail rates only after adopting a new plan and new plans for future years.",32,,
179,0.97,1028.827,1051.85,"However, the widespread disruption of the pandemic last year interrupted the expected update to the strategic planning and rate path and the economic stresses due to the pandemic, the executive at City light did not submit and the Council did not take up any Ratesetting for 2020.",32,,
180,0.97,1051.85,1054.787,There was a similar thing that happened for Seattle public utilities.,32,,
181,0.97,1054.787,1064.763,"However, city light does plan to deliver a 2022 through 2026 strategic plan to Council, this may.",32,,
182,0.97,1064.763,1070.903,"And with that, the framing pieces, I think I will step aside.",32,,
183,0.97,1070.903,1071.87,Thank you for your time.,32,,
184,0.97,1071.87,1073.739,"Thank you, Eric.",33,,
185,0.97,1073.739,1079.111,I appreciate your thorough analysis of this and your memo that is posted Online for folks.,33,,
186,0.97,1079.111,1084.75,"And let's hear from city light, then we will take questions from Council members.",33,,
187,0.97,1084.75,1087.386,"General manager, Smith, Takeaway.",33,,
188,0.97,1087.386,1089.855,"Eric, you did a great job.",34,,
189,0.97,1089.855,1092.124,Feel like you did my job for me.,34,,
190,0.97,1092.124,1105.104,"I am Debra Smith, general manager and Ceo although today and today only, you can call me Debbie, my childhood name and I am in fact of Irish dissent.",34,,
191,0.97,1105.104,1117.783,"So, once a year you can call me Debbie, but other than that I am always, truly Eric, you did a great job on Reframing.",34,,
192,0.97,1117.783,1132.331,"First of all I appreciate the opportunity that we staff have had over the last week or so, to run through this presentation with some of you and some of your staff members and it has been really helpful.",34,,
193,0.97,1132.331,1134.9,We have had the opportunity to understand what is important to you.,34,,
194,0.97,1134.9,1138.904,You will see a different deck then you saw last week.,34,,
195,0.97,1138.904,1140.739,Or at least some parts will be different.,34,,
196,0.97,1140.739,1142.441,If we did a Readout.,34,,
197,0.97,1142.441,1150.349,And we are continuing to work behind the scenes to offer briefings to other Council members both on this committee and/or the full council.,34,,
198,0.97,1150.349,1159.358,Happy to do that and to work with folks that want additional information.,34,,
199,0.97,1159.358,1163.562,"We recognize that for me and many of you, this is the first time you have engaged city light rates.",34,,
200,0.97,1163.562,1171.97,"I actually joined the city Mid- October of 2018, and as Eric mentioned, we had a strategic plan that had been approved the summer before.",34,,
201,0.97,1171.97,1177.976,Which set out a rate path for six years.,34,,
202,0.97,1177.976,1187.786,"But also adopted through the process, rates that went into effect January 1 of 19, and January 1 of 20.",34,,
203,0.97,1187.786,1199.731,"And of course the plan that we had completed, and largely was complete last year, before we put it on the shelf and said we will work to support our community and the best way that we can do that is to stay the course and hold rates flat.",34,,
204,0.97,1199.731,1204.803,"So, we had no rate action the first of this year.",34,,
205,0.97,1204.803,1212.211,"And again, this strategy that we have developed is important.",34,,
206,0.97,1212.211,1224.022,"Because we, and you will see in our Sli, unlike many city departments, of course we are not a general fund Department but we have experienced a significant reduction in revenue associated with loss of load.",34,,
207,0.97,1224.022,1227.492,Which you will see.,34,,
208,0.97,1227.492,1230.596,Will start with the first bite or two and then turn it over to my colleagues.,34,,
209,0.97,1230.596,1233.599,"If you could advance, that would be great.",34,,
210,0.97,1233.599,1251.75,"And while we are doing that I will mention that we have with us, Kirsty Grainger, Seattle city light Cfo, and we have more running the show and Chris Ruffini is here, the Finance director.",34,,
211,0.97,1251.75,1259.291,"So, much of what you will hear today is from Keirsey and Chris.",34,,
212,0.97,1259.291,1262.427,I will skip over this and I think that Eric did a great job.,34,,
213,0.97,1262.427,1275.04,The intent here is to provide bills but stability to customers while maintaining service level during Covid-19 recovery.,34,,
214,0.97,1275.04,1288.987,"And one thing that you will hear today is we are unclear, as we all are, about how the recovery will happen and how and over what period of time we will gain back the load we lost during Covid-19.",34,,
215,0.97,1288.987,1303.602,"So, the other thing I want to mention, again, the January 120 22, January 1, 2022, the proposed increase of 3% was proposed in the last plan by Council.",34,,
216,0.97,1303.602,1310.809,We expect the impact to customers would actually be more like 2.4%.,34,,
217,0.97,1310.809,1320.052,So we make assumptions around what Bonneville power administration will charge us for the power we purchase from them.,34,,
218,0.97,1320.052,1324.523,Which is 30 to 40% of how we serve our community.,34,,
219,0.97,1324.523,1332.33,And then they go through a two year rate case and are currently in the rate case right now.,34,,
220,0.97,1332.33,1336.868,"The rates for Bonneville change every two years, on the odd year.",34,,
221,0.97,1336.868,1341.807,"They are October one, because that is the start of the Federal year.",34,,
222,0.97,1341.807,1352.351,"We make an assumption around what we think that will be and depending on what it actually is, the difference, an automatic pass through Council, requiring no city action.",34,,
223,0.97,1352.351,1362.627,"We do have the flex ability to push the timing of that slightly, so we can use the 1.5% we are expecting as an offset to the 3.9%.",34,,
224,0.97,1362.627,1369.968,"Let's advance the Sli, more raw.",34,,
225,0.97,1369.968,1377.676,"So, part of the conversation that we had yesterday, doing utility rates what one might be helpful.",34,,
226,0.97,1377.676,1386.084,I will run through the one slide and then run this to my team.,34,,
227,0.97,1386.084,1388.487,We set rates to cover the cost of operations.,34,,
228,0.97,1388.487,1392.791,The rate setting is a two part process.,34,,
229,0.97,1392.791,1420.952,"There is one, what is the revenue requirement, how much money do we need to collect in order to pay our operations and maintenance for the services that we received from the city, to pay for the purchased power and labor costs, and to cover both debt service that we typically use to fund a portion of our capital improvement plan, as well as the portion of the improvement plan that we fund with current revenues.",34,,
230,0.97,1420.952,1422.988,So that is the revenue requirement.,34,,
231,0.97,1422.988,1434.533,"The second part of the rate setting process, which is not called out specifically here, is where we determined to allocate the cost.",34,,
232,0.97,1434.533,1447.445,"So there was, before I came here, again in the summer of 2018, as the strategic plan was being transmitted, there was interest in the part of both a review panel and Council members, to look at how we are allocating the cost.",34,,
233,0.97,1447.445,1455.854,I want to be clear up front to say we have not completed the work intentionally going into that period of time.,34,,
234,0.97,1455.854,1468.066,We use a process called the cost of service analysis or--that is the industry standard that is used to allocate cost amongst different classes.,34,,
235,0.97,1468.066,1476.675,"That actually looks and says, where are the costs being experienced in the drivers for cost?",34,,
236,0.97,1476.675,1484.983,It ALLOCATES them to the classes based on how they support the customer class.,34,,
237,0.97,1484.983,1493.592,"That is something we typically do, most typical utilities do every couple of years, or certainly when there is an infrequent rate action.",34,,
238,0.97,1493.592,1507.506,"We would have done cost of service analysis last year, that was one of the things we cut out of the budget during Covid-19 because we were not doing the rate access.",34,,
239,0.97,1507.506,1519.718,"And now we are just calling for a one year action, while completing the planning process, we are deferring it until 2022.",34,,
240,0.97,1519.718,1533.832,"The staff would intend to do the work, complete the work next year and then influence, and the various rate classes of January of 2023.",34,,
241,0.97,1533.832,1536.134,I want to be clear about that.,34,,
242,0.97,1536.134,1546.144,"We understand where the rate design is so when Eric indicated the rate increase would be across the board, we have not modified it.",34,,
243,0.97,1546.144,1549.848,"City Council, this is important.",34,,
244,0.97,1549.848,1562.761,"Working with the state utility board, and the state of Washington, they are the rate setting authority.",34,,
245,0.97,1562.761,1569.935,There was quite a bit of Pushback from Olympia.,34,,
246,0.97,1569.935,1583.381,"This is the defining factor for public power, you are the rate setting authority, and in that role you represent the customer and the customer's voice.",34,,
247,0.97,1583.381,1613.511,"Supplemental automatic rate mechanisms, that the previous Council took to provide stability rates and revenue requirement, again I already spoke how the Bonneville--works, so we put that in the rate trajectory, because we do not know and Bonneville will not finalize its current rate process until August of this year, that is the Timeframe.",34,,
248,0.97,1613.511,1619.217,We usually get about 60 to 90 days notice before goes into effect with Bonneville.,34,,
249,0.97,1619.217,1620.385,It passes through automatically.,34,,
250,0.97,1620.385,1630.195,"Typical rate process, you know, as mentioned, typically we would bring in a new strategic plan every two years.",34,,
251,0.97,1630.195,1642.741,"The strategic plan would cover a six year period and include a six rate rate--six year rate trajectory and through the action you would be, I cannot remember the word, Chris, what is the word?",34,,
252,0.97,1642.741,1649.447,"We are actually, you are actually docked in the first years rate action and what is it in the second year?",34,,
253,0.97,1649.447,1654.152,The endorsed budget if that's what you're talking about.,35,,
254,0.97,1654.152,1667.399,"Typically as you approve the two year budget, you are endorsing the rate structure for a second year and then it gets confirmed when we build a second year budget and bring it forward.",36,,
255,0.97,1667.399,1669.167,We are doing that kind of this year.,36,,
256,0.97,1669.167,1672.737,The only difference is this year you have not seen the strategic plan yet.,36,,
257,0.97,1672.737,1679.044,"The plan, which, we are at a point, we have the bones of it.",36,,
258,0.97,1679.044,1699.497,"We know what the business strategies are, we have great examples of the projects, the actions, the initiatives that we plan to take it about ready to turn the strategic plan and then we would be on the path to bring it forward to you after the review panel produces their letter, etc.",36,,
259,0.97,1699.497,1712.21,It is important to note that the Council has been no involved and--has been involved and they support the actions we are supporting today.,36,,
260,0.97,1712.21,1717.115,The letter that generally comes with formal approval will come with the strategic plan.,36,,
261,0.97,1717.115,1723.488,"So where we are now, again, rate process in 2020, impacted by Covid-19.",36,,
262,0.97,1723.488,1738.937,"We balance the 2021 budget with a one-time reduction, brought no rate action forward and now we are talking about switching the current Rsa surcharge and converting it to a base rate increment.",36,,
263,0.97,1738.937,1740.205,And with no bill impacts.,36,,
264,0.97,1740.205,1751.049,"And of course, the 3.9% potential action for January 1, 2022.",36,,
265,0.97,1751.049,1755.954,I think that is what I covered and are there any questions before we move forward into the specifics were today?,36,,
266,0.97,1755.954,1757.756,"Please, continue.",37,,
267,0.97,1757.756,1760.859,"Okay, seeing none.",38,,
268,0.97,1760.859,1765.363,"I will turn it over to my colleague, Kirsty Grainger, Seattle city light.",38,,
269,0.97,1765.363,1765.964,A morning.,39,,
270,0.97,1765.964,1780.879,"A little bit more background on city lights, what is happening Úin the electricity world, Owin to Covid-19 and pandemic response, so, last year, you will see this chart here, shows electricity demand in 2020.",39,,
271,0.97,1780.879,1797.495,"You can see that in the second quarter we saw a large decrease in commercial demand for electricity, a large increase in industrial, and small increase in demand for residential electricity.",39,,
272,0.97,1797.495,1809.073,"Which hopefully make sense, as people who used to work in the downtown core, like many of us on this call, went to Telework in their homes.",39,,
273,0.97,1809.073,1813.511,We saw a big reduction in commercial electricity use.,39,,
274,0.97,1813.511,1826.424,"But also an Uptick in residential use, if you are like me at home, running three zoom calls simultaneously in your house.",39,,
275,0.97,1826.424,1836.701,"And so for city light, you can see in the chart at the bottom, our challenge is that our makeup of who uses electricity is strongly weighted towards commercial use.",39,,
276,0.97,1836.701,1843.641,"We are a very urban area and Seattle has a large, vibrant, normally downtown core.",39,,
277,0.97,1843.641,1848.046,That is a big part of our electricity demand.,39,,
278,0.97,1848.046,1856.12,"You can see there in the chart at the bottom, 57%, of electricity use is attributable to commercial.",39,,
279,0.97,1856.12,1858.356,Only about one third is residential.,39,,
280,0.97,1858.356,1864.662,"So what happened is, the commercial use dropped and some was offset by an increase in the residential side.",39,,
281,0.97,1864.662,1866.965,But not all of it.,39,,
282,0.97,1866.965,1889.087,"And this is something that in talking with our friends at Spu, talking with our colleagues in the industry, this is something where for Seattle city light, we have been impacted more severely by pandemic response, then I guess Spu.",39,,
283,0.97,1889.087,1891.756,"In their case the commercial and residential almost offset, as I understand it.",39,,
284,0.97,1891.756,1899.497,"And In-Service territories that may be more suburban, they will have a stronger residential presence and that offset is more balanced.",39,,
285,0.97,1899.497,1903.601,"But for Citi bike, this is a significant revenue issue.",39,,
286,0.97,1903.601,1910.875,"And in 2020, our revenue gap totaled about $35 million.",39,,
287,0.97,1910.875,1937.502,"I will mention here too, another factor that I know is top of line for us, is residential customers that have been impacted by the pandemic and are now struggling to pay their rent, bills, and so this is something else that is also translating to a revenue challenge.",39,,
288,0.97,1937.502,1943.241,"Correct me if I get the steps wrong, but my understanding is we have about 10% of the residential customers who are behind on their electricity bills right now.",39,,
289,0.97,1943.241,1946.944,That is significant.,39,,
290,0.97,1946.944,1954.652,"In 2020, this will contribute to about a $20 million write off in revenues from customers who will be able to pay bills.",39,,
291,0.97,1954.652,1973.237,"And so as we talk about the financial challenges that we are looking at in the upcoming years, you know, making sure that we are funding and planning for a path to get the customers back on track with their bills and helping them do that, is also very important.",39,,
292,0.97,1973.237,1977.075,Can you go to the next slide?,39,,
293,0.97,1977.075,1986.384,"So, switching back to the commercial view, this big uncertainty with us with the revenue is when will commercial use come back?",39,,
294,0.97,1986.384,1992.156,"Very strongly tied to, when will downtown come back?",39,,
295,0.97,1992.156,1994.992,"You can see this is kind of a cool chart, a bubble chart.",39,,
296,0.97,1994.992,2004.969,The size of the bubble indicates the commercial sector and how much our electricity demand is represented by the sector.,39,,
297,0.97,2004.969,2014.879,"You can see on the left we have got sectors like data centers, hospitals, so those are significant.",39,,
298,0.97,2014.879,2017.315,But they have not been impacted very much by pandemic response.,39,,
299,0.97,2017.315,2017.782,Which make sense.,39,,
300,0.97,2017.782,2025.523,"But there are other sectors like office space, lodging, restaurants, that have been impacted a lot.",39,,
301,0.97,2025.523,2033.631,You can see the 10% range and office space makes up about one third of our commercial demand.,39,,
302,0.97,2033.631,2056.454,"Even more impacted, this is probably very intuitive, universities, schools, and the category called Assembly, which would include theaters, houses of worship, Stadiums, places where people gather and obviously that is an area where we have seen the pandemic impact them a lot.",39,,
303,0.97,2056.454,2066.063,"So we have seen reductions, 25% less in electricity demand from those businesses.",39,,
304,0.97,2066.063,2068.032,"All right, one more slide on the retail sales.",39,,
305,0.97,2068.032,2078.776,"So, all of this together, attributed to a 4% decline in retail sales, electricity demand for city light, in 2020.",39,,
306,0.97,2078.776,2091.789,"And owing to improvement and efficiency, efficient new housing stock, city light is seeing our energy use, demand for electricity on the decline for several years now.",39,,
307,0.97,2091.789,2097.094,Which has been a financial challenge for us that we have been watching and monitoring closely.,39,,
308,0.97,2097.094,2101.833,"Now layering on top of that the impacts of the pandemic, we can see that we just shifted down a lot.",39,,
309,0.97,2101.833,2106.704,And so this is a very significant financial challenge for us.,39,,
310,0.97,2106.704,2110.775,And something we will be contending with for the next 5 to 8 years.,39,,
311,0.97,2110.775,2116.18,"So, two things to take away from the start, number one, near-term recovery.",39,,
312,0.97,2116.18,2124.422,"Particularly the commercial sector, particularly the downtown core, is a significant driver for the revenue recovery.",39,,
313,0.97,2124.422,2143.207,"And then relieve the long-term growth is everything HINGING on transportation, buildings, so Council members I know that this is a topic that is not just about city light but across other policies.",39,,
314,0.97,2143.207,2153.15,"For example, the work that they are doing to change building codes, that will be a major factor in driving long term stability and long-term rate Affordability for customer owners.",39,,
315,0.97,2153.15,2156.921,And Council member Strauss?,40,,
316,0.97,2156.921,2163.06,Thank you chairman and Unhoused.,41,,
317,0.97,2163.06,2176.14,"My question distance from previous conversations where we live quite in-depth, to call out the fact that the dotted line that is on the downward trajectory is then put into an upward trajectory, both the Orange and blue.",41,,
318,0.97,2176.14,2193.891,"Not only because of energy code that we just passed, also because of Metro looking to Electrify their fleet . We talked a little bit about Washington state ferry system using electrical and just Electrification spending across the market.",41,,
319,0.97,2193.891,2217.181,"And while you touched on the fact that as we become more energy efficient, we have seen a decrease in demand and this is where we have a really amazing opportunity to use a very green energy source, with city light energy sources, to fight the climate crisis.",41,,
320,0.97,2217.181,2221.686,And bring your demand back by increasing our reliance on electricity.,41,,
321,0.97,2221.686,2229.126,I don't have a question but wanted to highlight that you had gone in depth in that you provided really great feedback.,41,,
322,0.97,2229.126,2243.207,"But if you or anyone else on the team wants to expand on the other areas of opportunity for Electrification and how that is offsetting our energy efficiency, we would love to hear it.",41,,
323,0.97,2243.207,2245.61,"Well, I will just jump in for a moment.",42,,
324,0.97,2245.61,2254.852,"I think and I know Sam Zimbabwe, is on this call too.",42,,
325,0.97,2254.852,2259.257,"The city is releasing their transportation, the Electrification roadmap.",42,,
326,0.97,2259.257,2277.975,And it truly is a multi- Department effort on how and how the city continues to move towards deep Decarbonization through Electrification.,42,,
327,0.97,2277.975,2281.879,"At this point, as you pointed out, going forward of the building sector, giving changes in code.",42,,
328,0.97,2281.879,2297.161,"You know we are, when this load forecast originally came to city light's executive team, in late 2020, we had not incorporated the new building code information.",42,,
329,0.97,2297.161,2300.197,"We looked at it and it was even Scarier, but honestly.",42,,
330,0.97,2300.197,2311.409,Then we asked staff to go back and look at their assumptions around both Electrification and building sector.,42,,
331,0.97,2311.409,2325.089,"Again it is one of the areas of great uncertainty because it is unclear how the economic recovery and the move towards Electrification, how those two will align going forward with respect to timing.",42,,
332,0.97,2325.089,2335.9,"The good news is, as you pointed out, we do have information now from public transportation, partners and folks we are look working closely with.",42,,
333,0.97,2335.9,2341.439,"As you pointed out the port, Metro, etc.",42,,
334,0.97,2341.439,2343.107,They are mostly moving forward with their plans.,42,,
335,0.97,2343.107,2353.551,"For most of them, the Electrification of public transportation is something where it is a long planning cycle, long lead times in terms of orders, and a lot of public and Federal funding to help with those efforts.",42,,
336,0.97,2353.551,2359.256,Fortunately that does not seem to be slowing down and we feel very encouraged by that.,42,,
337,0.97,2359.256,2363.16,We also are having increased luck.,42,,
338,0.97,2363.16,2365.863,"We were slow at the beginning, moving forward with our own electric utility.",42,,
339,0.97,2365.863,2372.903,The publicly owned charged as well is working with the public sector.,42,,
340,0.97,2372.903,2380.578,We have got it going in a groove now and some of our team have really focused on how to make it easy.,42,,
341,0.97,2380.578,2387.585,We set a goal for ourselves that we wanted folks to be able to spend money in our community and we would do everything that we could to support them.,42,,
342,0.97,2387.585,2390.387,And other private sector charging companies.,42,,
343,0.97,2390.387,2397.194,"So, I feel that we are gaining real Omentum both as a country but also a city.",42,,
344,0.97,2397.194,2404.568,"So this is huge for us and the way we talk about it all the time, my team, you know gets tired of hearing me say that.",42,,
345,0.97,2404.568,2406.003,We are investing in our future load.,42,,
346,0.97,2406.003,2421.218,"You know, has become forward and bring you the strategic plan here shortly, and you will see that, one of our huge, big initiatives going forward is grid modernization so we can invest in and support Electrification in a graceful way over time.",42,,
347,0.97,2421.218,2444.041,"That is critically important for us because again, as we continue to invest in energy efficiency and created the downward pressure, this is our opportunity to continue to push the deep Decarbonization, even more so, not more so but in conjunction with energy efficiency with the load in the revenue that we need to survive and thrive.",42,,
348,0.97,2444.041,2446.777,Thank you.,42,,
349,0.97,2451.248,2452.349,"Please, continue.",43,,
350,0.97,2452.349,2456.22,Great.,44,,
351,0.97,2456.22,2499.363,"So, owing to the challenges on the retail sales side, looking out to 2022, which we are doing as we do our prep work for the new strategic plan that will be bringing to city council this summer, our preliminary forecast indicates that taking into account the reduced demand for electricity, restoring the one-time cuts that we adopted in our 2020 budget, and then looking ahead to the 2022 budget, restoring the productions, the declining load, absorbing two years of inflation and other factors, this indicates a need of 7% increase in January of 2022.",44,,
352,0.97,2499.363,2502.666,Absent of other action.,44,,
353,0.97,2502.666,2518.082,"So, the opportunity that is presented by the Rsa surcharges rolling off here in the beginning of 2021, this is a strategy where we would exchange the Rsa surcharges for the base rate increase.",44,,
354,0.97,2518.082,2520.251,And then implement the small rate increase in January of 2022.,44,,
355,0.97,2520.251,2534.532,"We see that as an opportunity to smooth bills, smooth rates, because otherwise the alternative would be if we did not take action, now, we would be implementing small rate decreases through 2021.",44,,
356,0.97,2534.532,2541.138,Then turned around and pull in a large increase at the end of the year.,44,,
357,0.97,2541.138,2546.911,And that is not the customer bill experience we would like to provide.,44,,
358,0.97,2546.911,2558.589,"So the smoothing opportunity, you can see in the chart down below, would have the effect just on base rate of smoothing that so we would not have to do a large rate action in 2022.",44,,
359,0.97,2561.859,2570.568,"Oh, and then this chart shows the bottom line here is the draft outlook for the strategic plan.",45,,
360,0.97,2570.568,2574.672,You will see formally later this year.,45,,
361,0.97,2574.672,2596.694,"But the intent is that you can see there that the 3.9% Aligns with the plan adopted by the former city council in 2018 and that endorsed rate . and what we intend to do, looking at it, to be able to deliver small inflation sized rate increases the out the horizon of the strategic plan.",45,,
362,0.97,2596.694,2598.395,Questions?,45,,
363,0.97,2598.395,2602.499,I know there is a lot on the slide.,45,,
364,0.97,2602.499,2605.102,We may have questions at the end.,46,,
365,0.97,2605.102,2606.303,Great.,47,,
366,0.97,2606.303,2606.77,All right.,47,,
367,0.97,2606.77,2610.407,"Councilmember Morales, please.",48,,
368,0.97,2610.407,2626.09,"First of all I want to thank Debra, Moira, and we had a briefing with my staff and I appreciate the time that you took to educate me on how this works.",49,,
369,0.97,2626.09,2643.107,"I just want to say that I appreciate your thoughtfulness in ensuring some stability and Detectability for customers . I know that, particularly for low income folks having incredible fluctuations in their rates is damaging.",49,,
370,0.97,2643.107,2649.146,"So, I am grateful to all of you for thinking through how to prevent that from happening.",49,,
371,0.97,2649.146,2649.847,Thank you.,49,,
372,0.97,2649.847,2653.083,Thank you.,50,,
373,0.97,2654.985,2658.455,"Moira, should we move ahead?",51,,
374,0.97,2658.455,2659.056,All right.,51,,
375,0.97,2659.056,2667.664,"So as both Debra and Eric discussed before, the ordinance poses to do the things in this yellow box here.",51,,
376,0.97,2667.664,2672.97,Exchanging the Rsa surcharges for a base rate increase of 3%.,51,,
377,0.97,2672.97,2679.943,"And looking ahead to January 1, 2022, legislating the 3.9% rate increase.",51,,
378,0.97,2679.943,2689.586,"Knowing that we would anticipate with the Bonneville announcement this summer, that that would translate into an effective increase of approximately 2.4%.",51,,
379,0.97,2689.586,2696.193,That would be what would actually go into the billing system in January of 2022.,51,,
380,0.97,2696.193,2708.806,"Just to provide some context for what this would translate into, for a typical residential customer, 2.4% is about $1.80 a month of an increase.",51,,
381,0.97,2708.806,2719.249,"And for customers who are enrolled in the utility discount program that provides a 60% discount on all of their electric bills, this would be about $.72 a month.",51,,
382,0.97,2725.255,2727.925,"All right, so one more slide.",52,,
383,0.97,2727.925,2730.627,This is just the next steps.,52,,
384,0.97,2730.627,2737.0,"So, March, we are discussing the ordinance.",52,,
385,0.97,2737.0,2741.138,"And as I understand it, we would then be looking for action on the 29th in amity.",52,,
386,0.97,2741.138,2747.811,"Obviously this is very close to April 1st, which would be the proposed effective date.",52,,
387,0.97,2747.811,2760.39,"But seeing as the putting of the ordinance into effect would do nothing, change nothing in the billing system, we do not need a lot of lead time to do nothing.",52,,
388,0.97,2760.39,2762.192,So that is what would happen in April.,52,,
389,0.97,2762.192,2779.343,"Been looking ahead to the summer, we would be bringing forward the 2022-2026 five-year strategic plan and looking for the Bonneville announcement in the summer on what the rate decrease will be coming out of the Bonneville Pass-Through.",52,,
390,0.97,2779.343,2785.282,"And then January 1, 2022, that would be after the budget process.",52,,
391,0.97,2785.282,2790.454,And at that point the budget for 2022 would be formally adopted through city council.,52,,
392,0.97,2790.454,2800.898,"That is when the 3.9 -1 1/2, so 2.4% effective rate would be implemented.",52,,
393,0.97,2800.898,2821.919,"And then we would come back to 2022, when we look at the next cycle, that is the next time you would see, as Debra mentioned, this is where we would bring forward the full rate case with cost of service rate design and all of that would be in the summer of 2022.",52,,
394,0.97,2821.919,2823.287,Thank you for the presentation.,53,,
395,0.97,2823.287,2828.158,I do want to let folks know that I did speak to the head of the city light review panel this week.,53,,
396,0.97,2828.158,2832.829,And he confirmed that they are supportive of this approach.,53,,
397,0.97,2832.829,2834.731,And this ordinance today.,53,,
398,0.97,2834.731,2854.051,"So, that is, general manager Smith mentioned the city light review panel briefly but just as a reminder for folks, they are the watchdog and we appoint some members and the Mayor appoints others and they work throughout the year and are on top of these things.",53,,
399,0.97,2854.051,2856.687,"Eric Mcconaghy from central staff, my staff attend those meetings.",53,,
400,0.97,2856.687,2866.964,"So, let's talk now about the timing of this . does anybody want to ask questions and then talk about the timing?",53,,
401,0.97,2866.964,2869.066,"Yes, Councilmember Strauss.",53,,
402,0.97,2869.066,2871.668,"Thank you, chair.",54,,
403,0.97,2871.668,2878.642,"Thank you again, Kirsty Grainger, general manager Debbie, and Eric.",54,,
404,0.97,2878.642,2884.982,"Again, it has not even been a week since the first time we met on this and we have been able to meet three times.",54,,
405,0.97,2884.982,2892.089,"So, just calling out the fact that you were able to meet and move quickly and meet with me a number of times.",54,,
406,0.97,2892.089,2904.201,"I am going to separate my comments to the rate stabilization account in the first half, and then the second half, and more, sorry, and Moira, you were amazing as well!",54,,
407,0.97,2904.201,2908.905,And then the second half Codifying the rate changes for 2022.,54,,
408,0.97,2908.905,2934.931,"So, above everything and all else, you have all done an amazing job this last year making sure that we are stabilizing rates, like I think slide six, it was slides three, four, five, six, demonstrating with demonstrating how our commercial accounts have dropped, the industrial accounts have dropped, residential has increased.",54,,
409,0.97,2934.931,2941.738,I could go on all day about how great of work you have done.,54,,
410,0.97,2941.738,2953.85,"Where my concerns lie are in that second path regarding Codifying the 2022 rate, for no other reason other than I have not had enough time to process it.",54,,
411,0.97,2953.85,2961.825,It is important for me to process it in the context of the strategic plan.,54,,
412,0.97,2961.825,2973.036,"So, speaking to general manager yesterday, it sounds like we will have the opportunity to sit down for an hour or maybe two, to discuss that before it comes to full council.",54,,
413,0.97,2973.036,2982.846,"And just for context, you know, the Kirkland easement that we just had before us, that we voted on, we had a briefing about a month ago.",54,,
414,0.97,2982.846,2983.814,Okay before committee twice.,54,,
415,0.97,2983.814,2999.129,"Understanding that this is moving faster than, we have the April 1ST deadline, I don't want to hold up your good work and I need to make sure I have the information needed to vote appropriately.",54,,
416,0.97,2999.129,3005.168,"Chair Pedersen, it is helpful to hear from the oversight board, thank you for connecting with them.",54,,
417,0.97,3005.168,3016.213,"Really my comments are just of Greek--deep gratitude, and calling out the fact that especially, S.D.O.T.",54,,
418,0.97,3016.213,3032.596,"Can attest to this, last year before the pandemic I was not briefed on a pedestrian bridge ordinance and we had to hold it, it got held up throughout the pandemic because we did not get a chance to come back and meet again.",54,,
419,0.97,3032.596,3038.335,"Again, calling out the seriousness that I take these briefings well in advance of meeting to take notes.",54,,
420,0.97,3038.335,3046.343,"So, happy to support us moving forward to the March 29th committee meeting.",54,,
421,0.97,3046.343,3053.15,"The reason, chair, that I had my ear so tuned to that is because I know we have to meet our April 1ST deadline.",54,,
422,0.97,3053.15,3059.856,"With that, if you want to speak, with that I have no further questions.",54,,
423,0.97,3059.856,3060.424,"Thank you, chair.",54,,
424,0.97,3060.424,3064.161,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,55,,
425,0.97,3064.161,3073.67,I agree that more time is appropriate and I am glad that we are able to work something out where we will have this at the March 29th city council.,55,,
426,0.97,3073.67,3084.881,"And, you know, as we schedule the committees, we will continue to try to build in more time.",55,,
427,0.97,3084.881,3086.083,Especially for the complex Council builds.,55,,
428,0.97,3086.083,3090.387,"So, I appreciate you raising that and I hear you on that.",55,,
429,0.97,3090.387,3098.395,Any other Council members want to make any comments or questions right now?,55,,
430,0.97,3098.395,3102.299,Councilmember Herbold?,55,,
431,0.97,3104.935,3106.603,Sorry about that.,56,,
432,0.97,3106.603,3109.473,I have a couple questions.,56,,
433,0.97,3109.473,3112.108,"One of them, you may have answered and I may have missed it.",56,,
434,0.97,3112.108,3128.325,"On the Rsa account, can you just talk a little bit about what this million dollar fund is, what specifically it can be used for.",56,,
435,0.97,3128.325,3133.497,Does keeping rates low during the pandemic qualify as use for the funds?,56,,
436,0.97,3133.497,3145.141,"Also, I am always interested in sort of what some of the capital drivers are of rate increases.",56,,
437,0.97,3145.141,3153.216,And I followed this because I used to chair the committee with oversight of Seattle public utilities.,56,,
438,0.97,3153.216,3171.535,"And one way we reduced the size of proposed rate increase was by reducing, because at Spu, the CIP definitely drives increases.",56,,
439,0.97,3171.535,3176.172,We reduced what was called the accomplishment rate of capital projects.,56,,
440,0.97,3176.172,3186.383,They had been assuming previously that what hundred percent of the projects would be completed 100% of the time.,56,,
441,0.97,3186.383,3195.959,"And by reducing the accomplishment rate two more aligned with what actually happens in capital projects, we were able to bring it down.",56,,
442,0.97,3195.959,3201.097,So I am interested to know whether or not Seattle city light has been accomplishment rate.,56,,
443,0.97,3201.097,3206.202,And whether or not the CIP has increases internally.,56,,
444,0.97,3206.202,3208.939,Thanks.,56,,
445,0.97,3214.411,3218.782,"While I can try to answer your questions, and then Eric and Debra, unless you would like to go first.",57,,
446,0.97,3218.782,3219.015,Sorry.,57,,
447,0.97,3219.015,3221.418,Go ahead.,58,,
448,0.97,3221.418,3228.625,"Your first question about the Rsa, the Rsa, the rules for operation are set by ordinance.",59,,
449,0.97,3228.625,3235.532,And currently the fund is restricted to only balancing revenues from wholesale sales.,59,,
450,0.97,3235.532,3242.739,"With that said, with Council action, there are other possibilities.",59,,
451,0.97,3242.739,3255.118,I do know that coming soon is the expansion of the emergency assistance program for customer bills.,59,,
452,0.97,3255.118,3269.666,"And so this is one opportunity where if city light has cash, we could use it to support helping customers who are behind on their bills get those balances paid off.",59,,
453,0.97,3269.666,3272.402,"As far as the Rsa, to change anything about it would require ordinates.",59,,
454,0.97,3272.402,3280.043,"And to jump on that piece, because it does represent an opportunity, but we don't know what it is at this point.",60,,
455,0.97,3280.043,3287.384,"That is that we have also talked about Resizing the Rsa, which would again come back to you all for action.",60,,
456,0.97,3287.384,3310.573,"When the Rsa mechanism was developed, I think in 2010, and wholesale prices were considerably higher than they are now, you know just as we have slowly over time in our budget process, we have been bringing our expectations around wholesale revenue in line by gradually reducing the assumption of what we will make.",60,,
457,0.97,3310.573,3313.877,We have been doing that based on the reduction in prices.,60,,
458,0.97,3313.877,3316.713,So we do want to go back through and look at the mechanism.,60,,
459,0.97,3316.713,3325.922,"If it turns out the $100 million target is higher than it needs to be, then there would be the opportunity to look at what the funds would go to.",60,,
460,0.97,3325.922,3342.105,"Right now we think about the one-time funds that return, by converting the 3% surcharge into a permanent part of the rate base right now, that does represent incremental revenue to us in 2021.",60,,
461,0.97,3342.105,3348.011,We think about a primary use for that being helping customers with accrued balances.,60,,
462,0.97,3348.011,3364.561,"There is a piece of work in addition called ""road to recovery"" that we are working on with help and coordination with Spu and how do we help our customers work down those past due bills.",60,,
463,0.97,3364.561,3369.199,"And with the second part of your question, it is a really good question.",60,,
464,0.97,3369.199,3370.533,Yes.,60,,
465,0.97,3370.533,3393.99,"Every utility Council member--every utility, Councilmember Herbold, one of our key strategies in the reductions for 2021, as well as 2020, and going forward, is Rightsizing our capital investment going forward.",60,,
466,0.97,3393.99,3415.512,"Including the highlight of things to come, but when we bring you the strategic plan and financial information that supports it, you will see we are actually in the last two years of the strategic and making a change, and overt change to begin funding more of our capital from rates.",60,,
467,0.97,3415.512,3420.583,Which is consistent with our existing financial policy which we deviated from in some way.,60,,
468,0.97,3420.583,3423.82,That is to manage the debt service number which is really becoming quite a large piece.,60,,
469,0.97,3423.82,3434.03,"So we were able to reduce, that is one of the primary ways that we reduce the need for action in 2021, by reducing capital.",60,,
470,0.97,3434.03,3438.134,And therefore reducing the amount of debt we took on.,60,,
471,0.97,3438.134,3439.335,I don't know if that helps.,60,,
472,0.97,3439.335,3451.214,"We are probably in year three of implementing this, what we call C.A.R.E.S.",60,,
473,0.97,3451.214,3453.616,Act.,60,,
474,0.97,3453.616,3472.268,"I think most departments have this process and that is what Úwe call our process we look across the utility and capitalize all needs, said the notion of buckets of money where people say that is my money, because I've always heard that, we are doing away with that.",60,,
475,0.97,3472.268,3477.974,The executive team is really making the decisions around Trade-Offs and that is part of the broader strategy.,60,,
476,0.97,3477.974,3479.509,Which is to live within our% means.,60,,
477,0.97,3479.509,3491.487,"And to manage future rate action so that they look like the cost of living, and not continuing on a rate path that is not sustainable.",60,,
478,0.97,3491.487,3498.061,"And really quick, Councilmember Herbold, we do not assume 100% attainment rate.",61,,
479,0.97,3498.061,3501.965,"We start at 90%, and we modify from there.",61,,
480,0.97,3501.965,3507.07,We take a number of cash adjustments when we are doing the planning.,61,,
481,0.97,3507.07,3509.505,Can you speak a little bit more to that?,62,,
482,0.97,3509.505,3514.611,What do you mean that you start at 90% and then you --,62,,
483,0.97,3514.611,3517.013,Apologies for interrupting.,63,,
484,0.97,3517.013,3529.125,"They can reach they can speak to the other adjustments but we do make other adjustments to the forecast, if we do the revenue requirement.",63,,
485,0.97,3529.125,3529.792,Are you ready?,63,,
486,0.97,3529.792,3531.194,Sorry to put you on the spot.,63,,
487,0.97,3531.194,3532.228,No worries.,64,,
488,0.97,3532.228,3533.63,No worries.,64,,
489,0.97,3533.63,3534.03,Yeah.,64,,
490,0.97,3534.03,3544.307,It is looking at some trend analysis of how capital projects are budgeted and then when we have actually spent the money.,64,,
491,0.97,3544.307,3555.118,"So we tend to budget, thinking that we will spend the money for the capital project sooner than we do.",64,,
492,0.97,3555.118,3561.958,"So within our planning of our capital expenses, with the Ratesetting portion, we assume that we shift some of the capital spending out every year.",64,,
493,0.97,3561.958,3567.23,It is shifted out to more reflect what is reflective in history.,64,,
494,0.97,3567.23,3576.572,"So we do have that adjustment to downward size our capital program, at least compared to the budget amount when we separate it.",64,,
495,0.97,3576.572,3581.978,"Just Barry, sorry, --",65,,
496,0.97,3581.978,3584.347,I was going to say it is super helpful.,66,,
497,0.97,3584.347,3593.656,"And to chair Pedersen, Spu used to have and accomplish rate, assuming 100% and they went down to 97%.",66,,
498,0.97,3593.656,3599.862,"And was really able to reduce the size of their rate, proposed rate increase, in doing so.",66,,
499,0.97,3599.862,3603.466,This might be another issue to bring up with Spu again.,66,,
500,0.97,3603.466,3609.973,Because Seattle city light is assuming 90% project completion rate.,66,,
501,0.97,3609.973,3614.51,That suggests that Spu might be able to go lower.,66,,
502,0.97,3614.51,3620.116,Thank you for your leadership on that with Seattle public utilities.,67,,
503,0.97,3620.116,3628.191,I am sure they are listening now and we will be sure to follow up.,67,,
504,0.97,3628.191,3636.532,"Councilmembers, any other questions on this Debra Smith--Oir?",67,,
505,0.97,3636.532,3644.607,"Again, Councilmembers, you will have additional time here.",67,,
506,0.97,3644.607,3646.042,My motion will talk about March 29th.,67,,
507,0.97,3646.042,3651.948,"So now I move that the committee recommend approval of CB 120015, item number two.",67,,
508,0.97,3651.948,3653.85,Is there a second?,67,,
509,0.97,3653.85,3654.217,Second.,68,,
510,0.97,3654.217,3656.652,Moved and Seconded.,69,,
511,0.97,3656.652,3663.96,"Appearance of the full city council on March 29th, as we have discussed earlier.",69,,
512,0.97,3663.96,3666.963,Any final comments?,69,,
513,0.97,3666.963,3667.33,Okay.,69,,
514,0.97,3667.33,3678.441,"Will the Kirk please call the role, the direct passage of this bill and the full council March 29th.",69,,
515,0.97,3678.441,3679.675,Gonzalez.,70,,
516,0.97,3679.675,3681.644,Aye.,71,,
517,0.97,3681.644,3684.147,Herbold,72,,

523,0.97,3691.788,3694.39,Pedersen?,78,,
524,0.97,3694.39,3696.492,Yes.,79,,
525,0.97,3696.492,3699.896,"Thank you, the motion carries.",79,,
526,0.97,3699.896,3703.966,And it will be sent to the March 29th city council meeting for final consideration.,79,,
527,0.97,3703.966,3712.608,Thank you and thanks to everyone for city light for your hard work on this and thank you to Eric from central staff.,79,,
528,0.97,3712.608,3715.711,Thank you very much Council and leaders and thank you.,80,,
529,0.97,3715.711,3721.317,Take care.,81,,
530,0.97,3721.317,3724.32,Will the clerk please read the title of the next agenda into the record?,82,,
531,0.97,3724.32,3729.625,Agenda item 3. presentation on West Seattle bridge status for briefing and consideration.,83,,
532,0.97,3729.625,3733.129,Thank you.,84,,
533,0.97,3733.129,3748.044,"Inconsideration for grant acceptance from Puget sound Council, for the West Seattle bridge, next item on the agenda, Cb120017, we will get a brief update on the restoration work and efforts around the West Seattle bridge.",84,,
534,0.97,3748.044,3752.115,This is similar to the presentation received last week by the community task force.,84,,
535,0.97,3752.115,3757.82,"So I want to also welcome central staff analyst Calvin chow, tracking the issues for us.",84,,
536,0.97,3757.82,3771.334,"And a shout out to Councilmember Herbold, where we will hear from next with the 100,000 constituents on the issue over the past several months with S.D.O.T.",84,,
537,0.97,3771.334,3778.875,"And others . So, Calvin chow, anything you want to say before we jump into the presentation?",84,,
538,0.97,3778.875,3780.343,"No, I have no introductory mark.",85,,
539,0.97,3780.343,3782.378,Thank you.,86,,
540,0.97,3782.378,3782.979,Welcome S.D.O.T.,86,,
541,0.97,3782.979,3788.351,And direct Yourone.,86,,
542,0.97,3788.351,3789.318,Takeaway.,86,,
543,0.97,3789.318,3790.586,Absolutely.,87,,
544,0.97,3790.586,3793.923,Thank you for always having us here.,87,,
545,0.97,3793.923,3800.696,We are always happy to come and talk about the West Seattle bridge at all we are doing.,87,,
546,0.97,3800.696,3823.219,"This remains an emergency for us and the people, we recognize the impacts that the continued closure of the bridge has on community members and business, and the whole transportation network in the city and beyond that in the whole of the state in terms of access that it provides to the port of Seattle.",87,,
547,0.97,3823.219,3831.994,"We want to give you, we reached important milestones and we talked about this with the task force last week.",87,,
548,0.97,3831.994,3837.733,We want to talk about that and the other things that we continue to do as part's mitigation to the impacts.,87,,
549,0.97,3837.733,3842.038,And the sword of full program of things that we do.,87,,
550,0.97,3842.038,3850.413,"I want to turn it over to Heather Marx, leading the whole of the efforts, and we look forward to questions and discussions.",87,,
551,0.97,3850.413,3854.75,I will turn it over to Heather at this point.,87,,
552,0.97,3854.75,3855.418,Thanks.,88,,
553,0.97,3855.418,3858.454,Good morning everyone.,88,,
554,0.97,3858.454,3860.356,Happy St. Patrick's day.,88,,
555,0.97,3860.356,3865.461,Our presentation today is wearing the green.,88,,
556,0.97,3865.461,3867.93,To honor that occasion.,88,,
557,0.97,3867.93,3876.072,Today we would like to go over some bridge updates and talk a little bit about the low bridge access policy.,88,,
558,0.97,3876.072,3884.88,"Reconnect West Seattle implementation, everybody's favorite topic, and then we will cover some next steps.",88,,
559,0.97,3884.88,3890.786,"If that sounds like a reasonable way to spend the next few minutes, I will start.",88,,
560,0.97,3890.786,3900.663,"So, the key issues that we, this photo, by the way, this was taken by a local journalist, Patrick Robinson.",88,,
561,0.97,3900.663,3916.312,"It comes from last summer when we were lifting the work platforms into place, during the summer as we were engaging in the stabilization work that we now continue to repair the bridge.",88,,
562,0.97,3916.312,3921.017,So our key issues right now are that we are maintaining an aggressive schedule on the phase 2 rehabilitation.,88,,
563,0.97,3921.017,3924.22,Phase 1 was stabilization.,88,,
564,0.97,3924.22,3933.229,We are continuing to deliver commitments and we are managing access to the lower Spokane Street bridge.,88,,
565,0.97,3933.229,3937.333,"Next slide, please.",88,,
566,0.97,3937.333,3947.543,"Just as a reminder, in case you have not been tracking, we closed the West Seattle bridge on May 23rd, 2020.",88,,
567,0.97,3947.543,3951.714,That first anniversary is coming right up.,88,,
568,0.97,3951.714,3961.991,"After the closure, our crack grow continued, which confirm that we were right to take traffic off the bridge, to prevent catastrophic collapse.",88,,
569,0.97,3961.991,3975.671,"You may recall the Mayor declared the closure a city emergency in July, and decided in November that we would move ahead with repair, rather than replacement.",88,,
570,0.97,3975.671,3981.911,"All of our initial stabilization efforts that I Mntioned earlier were completed in December, and everything is performing as expected.",88,,
571,0.97,3981.911,3986.782,Especially in light of the snow we got the weekend of February 11th and 12.,88,,
572,0.97,3986.782,3988.384,It is heavy.,88,,
573,0.97,3988.384,3992.755,And the bridge performed as we expected it to under that load.,88,,
574,0.97,3992.755,3996.392,"Next slide, please.",88,,
575,0.97,3996.392,3997.994,Oh.,88,,
576,0.97,3997.994,4005.167,"Okay, Councilmember Strauss, you have a question?",88,,
577,0.97,4005.167,4006.268,Thank you to Heather.,89,,
578,0.97,4006.268,4015.811,"In the last side, I wanted to call out the fact that closing such a major roadway and Connectivity point to a large part of our city is a difficult decision.",89,,
579,0.97,4015.811,4019.515,And just want to thank matt Donahue on the S.D.O.T.,89,,
580,0.97,4019.515,4019.749,Team.,89,,
581,0.97,4019.749,4020.716,It was a brave move.,89,,
582,0.97,4020.716,4031.627,I don't think that it was ever a light decision to go in and request the executive to make such a large-scale closure.,89,,
583,0.97,4031.627,4039.335,"2020 hindsight, clearly the right move, the right decision to make, just wanted to thank matt and your team for making that hard decision at that time.",89,,
584,0.97,4039.335,4043.305,Absolutely.,90,,
585,0.97,4043.305,4044.106,Thank you so much.,90,,
586,0.97,4044.106,4046.942,We are all grateful on a daily basis for matt Donahue.,90,,
587,0.97,4046.942,4054.95,We have reached an important milestone in the project where we have attained 30% design for the repairs.,90,,
588,0.97,4054.95,4065.828,"And 30% is magical because that is when we, it is called Baselining and that is when we Baselined the project and we decided on the scope, schedule and budget.",90,,
589,0.97,4065.828,4071.434,"And we hold Fidelity to those standards, what we hold ourselves to.",90,,
590,0.97,4071.434,4076.972,So the total program cost will be $175 million.,90,,
591,0.97,4076.972,4078.874,That includes much more than bridge repair.,90,,
592,0.97,4078.874,4084.38,Includes both the high and low bridge rehabilitation.,90,,
593,0.97,4084.38,4086.682,"Reconnecting West Seattle, the traffic mitigation effort we are undertaking.",90,,
594,0.97,4086.682,4097.893,"All of the structural health monitoring, all of the phase 1 rehabilitation and communication and project management.",90,,
595,0.97,4097.893,4104.6,"For the high bridge rehabilitation alone, we estimate $50 million and for the swing bridge rehabilitation we estimate $14 million.",90,,
596,0.97,4104.6,4112.274,"And as we come back to you in successive months, we will report to you on how we are doing against the baseline figures.",90,,
597,0.97,4112.274,4115.611,"Next slide, please.",90,,
598,0.97,4115.611,4123.419,"So, just as a reminder, here is a little line drawing of the bridge.",90,,
599,0.97,4123.419,4133.496,"It shows where we are going to add additional carbon fiber wrap, and where we are going to add additional post tensioning.",90,,
600,0.97,4133.496,4142.805,The gray on either side of the central span shows where we have added additional post tensioning as part of the stabilization effort.,90,,
601,0.97,4142.805,4150.412,But the Orange and the blue show you that we are going to do much more post tensioning and much more carbon fiber around.,90,,
602,0.97,4150.412,4155.918,"Not just in the middle, but also on the ends.",90,,
603,0.97,4155.918,4158.454,"In addition, we will do some ground stabilization work under pure 18.",90,,
604,0.97,4158.454,4164.727,That is the one on the far right side as you are looking at the slide.,90,,
605,0.97,4164.727,4170.866,And the ground stabilization work is not required as part of bridge opening.,90,,
606,0.97,4170.866,4178.874,But it is an important step in making sure that the bridge is Seismically strong.,90,,
607,0.97,4178.874,4186.682,We are also considering additional repair projects to the bridge corridor while it is out of Commission.,90,,
608,0.97,4186.682,4196.258,"While the bridge is closed and we want to make sure we have done all the repair, all the expansion joint replacements that we need to do, so we take advantage of that at that time for the people of the city of Seattle.",90,,
609,0.97,4196.258,4199.395,"Next slide, please.",90,,
610,0.97,4199.395,4203.332,We are also focusing attention on maintaining the swing bridge.,90,,
611,0.97,4203.332,4216.845,You may recall last year we finished a load rating exercise that demonstrated to us that the swing bridge was not meeting the new standards.,90,,
612,0.97,4216.845,4218.914,The bridge has not changed but the standards have changed.,90,,
613,0.97,4218.914,4225.888,"We are taking a Proactive approach to strengthen and monitoring the low bridge, while the Highbridge is closed.",90,,
614,0.97,4225.888,4227.59,It is the little bridge that could.,90,,
615,0.97,4227.59,4229.191,It is important that it continues to operate properly.,90,,
616,0.97,4229.191,4240.636,We are coordinating all of the efforts with current FHA standards and below bridge work is going to be on the same contract as the high bridge work.,90,,
617,0.97,4240.636,4250.312,"It is specialized work and in order to make sure that we have the very best proposals from contractors, we merged them into one project.",90,,
618,0.97,4250.312,4252.348,Next slide.,90,,
619,0.97,4252.348,4258.854,"So, for the below bridge, we will not have to do post tensioning.",90,,
620,0.97,4258.854,4259.655,Which is good news.,90,,
621,0.97,4259.655,4265.561,"We will have to install carbon fiber wrap, internal and external to the girders.",90,,
622,0.97,4265.561,4280.042,"We will complete epoxy crack injection throughout and most importantly we will take a look at repair if necessary, the mechanical lock system that matches the two spans together when it is closed to Marine Útraffic.",90,,
623,0.97,4280.042,4285.08,"Next slide, please.",90,,
624,0.97,4285.08,4291.887,"So as we have always anticipated, the high bridge is going to be repaired by the middle of 2022.",90,,
625,0.97,4291.887,4298.193,"And the low bridge will take a little longer, to the end of the third quarter.",90,,
626,0.97,4298.193,4308.47,"I want to note for everyone, that as soon as we are finished with the repairs on the high bridge, we will not drop our tools and open up the floodgates.",90,,
627,0.97,4308.47,4318.614,"We are going to have to open the bridge Lane biplane, and that will take a couple of weeks after the repair is done.",90,,
628,0.97,4318.614,4321.817,We feel that that is the safest way to ensure the repairs are working.,90,,
629,0.97,4321.817,4324.987,Because if they don't work the results can be catastrophic.,90,,
630,0.97,4324.987,4329.925,"Next slide, please.",90,,
631,0.97,4329.925,4334.43,Councilmember Strauss?,91,,
632,0.97,4334.43,4337.933,Or I can save my question for the end.,92,,
633,0.97,4337.933,4338.534,Go ahead.,93,,
634,0.97,4338.534,4341.637,Heather is impervious to any questions.,93,,
635,0.97,4341.637,4345.14,You have seen her answer everything and anything from everyone.,93,,
636,0.97,4345.14,4345.541,Wonderful.,94,,
637,0.97,4345.541,4349.645,My question was on slide 9.,94,,
638,0.97,4349.645,4364.359,"And, Heather, again, your team is doing excellent work here by moving quickly and ensuring that when we reopen we load test the bridge, to ensure that we are not putting too much load on it.",94,,
639,0.97,4364.359,4368.263,You mentioned the snow being a good example of us putting an extra load on it.,94,,
640,0.97,4368.263,4370.566,"My question, you talked about opening one Lane at a time.",94,,
641,0.97,4370.566,4372.668,This can create confusion for drivers.,94,,
642,0.97,4372.668,4376.972,Is there an opportunity for us to open just to buses and freight?,94,,
643,0.97,4376.972,4383.078,Can you speak a little bit more to the load testing?,94,,
644,0.97,4383.078,4383.545,Absolutely.,95,,
645,0.97,4383.545,4405.234,"We are talking with some of our, I am sorry, we are working with some traffic engineers, both internal and consultant, to help us create an opening plan that is going to generate as little confusion as possible.",95,,
646,0.97,4405.234,4415.611,"And so it makes sense for us to open it to large vehicles like transit, first.",95,,
647,0.97,4415.611,4425.487,"But like I said we are engaged in the planning and we will keep the Council, as well as the community, posted as it continues to develop.",95,,
648,0.97,4425.487,4432.427,"I want to acknowledge that as soon as the bridge is fixed, it will be very difficult for people to not want to get on the bridge right away.",95,,
649,0.97,4432.427,4434.53,We are responsible for public safety.,95,,
650,0.97,4434.53,4438.033,Like all city departments are.,95,,
651,0.97,4438.033,4445.541,We want to make sure that we are doing that in a way that is most responsible and most aware of consequences of that decision.,95,,
652,0.97,4445.541,4446.442,Good.,96,,
653,0.97,4446.442,4448.444,"Thank you, Heather.",96,,
654,0.97,4448.444,4458.453,"And maybe, if you don't have the answer, maybe a follow-up afterwards.",96,,
655,0.97,4458.453,4466.061,"Something that comes to mind is the transit, how they load test ahead of opening.",96,,
656,0.97,4466.061,4474.636,"Anecdotally I thought someone said to me takes them six months up to two years of testing on the rails, before they can put passengers on the trains.",96,,
657,0.97,4474.636,4475.037,On the rails.,96,,
658,0.97,4475.037,4478.073,And in the new stations.,96,,
659,0.97,4478.073,4480.342,Do you have a sense of how your work compares to that?,96,,
660,0.97,4480.342,4485.28,Do you have a sense of what sound transit does?,96,,
661,0.97,4485.28,4486.481,Thank you for the question.,97,,
662,0.97,4486.481,4489.151,I don't have the specifics on what sound transit does.,97,,
663,0.97,4489.151,4490.586,But I can check in with them.,97,,
664,0.97,4490.586,4490.986,On that.,97,,
665,0.97,4490.986,4501.263,I will say I know that the railway administration requires different kinds of safety procedures.,97,,
666,0.97,4501.263,4505.968,They are longer than what we are pondering.,97,,
667,0.97,4505.968,4511.907,And IC Calvins hand up too.,98,,
668,0.97,4511.907,4526.622,"I will jump in and say that transit has a way of opening new infrastructure, that requires a component, checks of all components and Trainings of drivers and all that.",98,,
669,0.97,4526.622,4528.624,We don't anticipate anything like that length of time.,98,,
670,0.97,4528.624,4529.625,Associated with this.,98,,
671,0.97,4529.625,4530.726,Great.,99,,
672,0.97,4530.726,4548.51,"And just the point, and Cal, please follow up, I just want to focus on the point I was making, even though what it once it is completed, the importance of taking the moment to make sure that it is load tested, is so critical.",99,,
673,0.97,4548.51,4549.411,Thank you.,99,,
674,0.97,4549.411,4559.154,I just want to add that a lot of sound transit's time is really about burning in the rails and checking the electrical systems in the control systems.,100,,
675,0.97,4559.154,4564.66,We also have a lot of signal intercepts that connect with the traffic systems.,100,,
676,0.97,4564.66,4567.963,There are a lot of other systems that are evaluated.,100,,
677,0.97,4567.963,4569.665,"Frankly, it is also a training run for operators.",100,,
678,0.97,4569.665,4580.676,"It is a little bit of a difference, a different situation than bringing back a facility that had been in use.",100,,
679,0.97,4580.676,4583.445,"So that, everybody is right, that makes me so happy.",101,,
680,0.97,4583.445,4588.483,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",102,,
681,0.97,4588.483,4589.084,Thank you.,103,,
682,0.97,4589.084,4591.353,I appreciate the Shamrock on the slide there.,103,,
683,0.97,4591.353,4592.688,Regarding the note on the bottom.,103,,
684,0.97,4592.688,4606.802,"Regarding the fact that the schedule and budget will be updated after we reach the stage of intermediate design, my recollection is that we are estimating that the stage and intermediate design is around July.",103,,
685,0.97,4606.802,4609.571,Is that right?,103,,
686,0.97,4609.571,4612.874,So that will be the opportunity to check the schedule.,103,,
687,0.97,4612.874,4613.709,That is correct.,104,,
688,0.97,4613.709,4616.578,Thank you.,105,,
689,0.97,4616.578,4619.014,"Late design, intermediate is what we used to call 60%.",106,,
690,0.97,4619.014,4619.982,Very good.,107,,
691,0.97,4619.982,4620.615,Thank you.,107,,
692,0.97,4620.615,4641.937,"And just in the context that Heather is about to talk about, that will also be once we have the contractor on board and have been able to talk about some of the Constructibility and have a much, you know, really the next Iteration of any changes to schedule budget.",108,,
693,0.97,4641.937,4645.44,We will continue to hold ourselves to what we have talked about in terms of 30%.,108,,
694,0.97,4645.44,4657.919,"So, I believe the last time that we spoke to Council, we let you know that we would move forward with a general contractor construction management approach to building this bridge repair.",109,,
695,0.97,4657.919,4663.158,We released the request for qualifications and project approach on March 10th.,109,,
696,0.97,4663.158,4668.864,And are expecting the proposals will be due in on April 12.,109,,
697,0.97,4668.864,4681.676,"It will take us a month or so to do the interviews that are required for us to select, to select a contractor.",109,,
698,0.97,4681.676,4703.398,This method of bringing the contractor on for design is finished gives us better schedule predictability and more opportunities to guard against change orders and also may provide some opportunities for us to squeeze the schedule.,109,,
699,0.97,4703.398,4712.007,"I don't in any way want to promise that, but it is a good way for us to ensure more project ability and avoid change orders during construction.",109,,
700,0.97,4712.007,4716.712,Because the contractor is sort of walking with us through the rest of the design process.,109,,
701,0.97,4716.712,4727.889,"And can flag any Constructibility issues or materials procurement issues before it is too late, the Fort makes a big difference in the schedule.",109,,
702,0.97,4727.889,4731.326,"Next slide, please.",109,,
703,0.97,4731.326,4743.105,"So within the Rfq P we have included our goals and you can tell they are important, because we included them in that document.",109,,
704,0.97,4743.105,4751.713,We obviously are committed to honoring the schedule commitments we have made to the community.,109,,
705,0.97,4751.713,4757.752,"We want to maximize safety for the workers, community, and traveling public.",109,,
706,0.97,4757.752,4759.554,That is always at the top of the list.,109,,
707,0.97,4759.554,4764.493,We also want to continue open communication about the project with the community.,109,,
708,0.97,4764.493,4771.133,So that means the contractor is going to have to be prepared to allow the press to take pictures.,109,,
709,0.97,4771.133,4775.37,They will have to allow things like Tourers when it is safe to do so.,109,,
710,0.97,4775.37,4780.075,So that is a lot of what that is about.,109,,
711,0.97,4780.075,4792.22,We also want to make sure that they are on board with the project team and Stakeholders with both design and construction.,109,,
712,0.97,4792.22,4795.39,A lot of times we get contractors on board and they just want to build it.,109,,
713,0.97,4795.39,4796.992,They don't want to engage with the community.,109,,
714,0.97,4796.992,4800.462,So we made it really clear that it was going to be important during this whole program.,109,,
715,0.97,4800.462,4802.731,We also want to make sure that they are good neighbors.,109,,
716,0.97,4802.731,4805.767,Minimizing the impact to Stakeholders on the public.,109,,
717,0.97,4805.767,4811.907,And it particularly our friends at pigeon point and West marginal way.,109,,
718,0.97,4811.907,4816.178,Our goal will be continuing to reopen in Mid-2022.,109,,
719,0.97,4816.178,4822.717,Next slide.,109,,
720,0.97,4822.717,4825.754,So I like a checklist and so here you have a checklist.,109,,
721,0.97,4825.754,4829.157,We have checked that for circle.,109,,
722,0.97,4829.157,4831.226,We have put out our contractor solicitation.,109,,
723,0.97,4831.226,4836.231,The next step will be to get the contractor on board and then hit final design.,109,,
724,0.97,4836.231,4840.335,Construction is likely to begin late this year.,109,,
725,0.97,4840.335,4844.84,"And then construction, like I said, will be done in the middle of 2022.",109,,
726,0.97,4844.84,4849.244,"Next slide, please.",109,,
727,0.97,4849.244,4856.751,One of the things that is important to S.D.O.T.,109,,
728,0.97,4856.751,4859.821,"And the Mayor, as we move forward, to continue to invest in surrounding communities.",109,,
729,0.97,4859.821,4877.772,"Not just for the mitigation efforts and the safety investments that we are making through Reconnect West Seattle, but also seeking approval to use a community workforce agreement and the city's hire for the project.",109,,
730,0.97,4877.772,4885.981,Specifically economically--zip codes.,109,,
731,0.97,4885.981,4887.649,We do need to seek approval from U.S. D.O.T.,109,,
732,0.97,4887.649,4890.085,And have had several conversations with them that have gone very well.,109,,
733,0.97,4890.085,4893.355,We expect to have a decision sometime in April.,109,,
734,0.97,4893.355,4907.469,"We also will include disadvantaged business enterprise goals, those goals are set typically by Watchdogs and are set later on in the program.",109,,
735,0.97,4907.469,4911.273,"Sam, did you want to add anything about community workforce?",109,,
736,0.97,4911.273,4922.684,"No, I think it remains a commitment and working through, as Heather said, approval is necessary to keep this going.",110,,
737,0.97,4922.684,4923.585,Okay.,111,,
738,0.97,4923.585,4930.392,The low bridge is the gift that keeps on giving.,111,,
739,0.97,4930.392,4933.361,It is a finite resource that everyone wants to have access to.,111,,
740,0.97,4933.361,4940.602,So we are working very hard to make sure that we are doing that equitably.,111,,
741,0.97,4940.602,4950.712,We began in January automated enforcement.,111,,
742,0.97,4950.712,4952.614,"So, private vehicles driving on the bridge between 5:00 A.M.",111,,
743,0.97,4952.614,4953.248,And 9:00 P.M.,111,,
744,0.97,4953.248,4956.518,Will be fined $75.00 per trip.,111,,
745,0.97,4956.518,4959.354,Unless they are already on a Preapproved list.,111,,
746,0.97,4959.354,4965.26,Which I will talk about here in the second.,111,,
747,0.97,4965.26,4969.831,"Since the very beginning of the program we have given priority access for emergency vehicles, heavy freight, and buses.",111,,
748,0.97,4969.831,4992.887,"And then we have worked with the Maritime community to ensure that people who work on harbor Island and terminal 5, members of Ilwu, are able to access that on East marginal way.",111,,
749,0.97,4992.887,4996.558,"Again, private vehicles may use the bridge between 9:00 P.M.",111,,
750,0.97,4996.558,5001.963,"And 5:00 a.m., that is when the volumes are low enough that we can open the bridge to everyone.",111,,
751,0.97,5001.963,5009.571,Right now we are conducting targeted outreach to the forming of--the spring.,111,,
752,0.97,5009.571,5017.812,"With the inclusion of Bipoc business, and people seeking treatments.",111,,
753,0.97,5017.812,5022.384,We expect to have a task for in April.,111,,
754,0.97,5022.384,5023.818,Next slide please.,111,,
755,0.97,5023.818,5030.091,"So, we sent spent a great time with the community.",111,,
756,0.97,5030.091,5030.992,Is appropriate.,111,,
757,0.97,5030.992,5034.229,This is a tremendous facility for the people of West Seattle.,111,,
758,0.97,5034.229,5039.1,We received lots of Emails and phone calls.,111,,
759,0.97,5039.1,5045.807,We send out weekly Email updates to 8600 people.,111,,
760,0.97,5045.807,5049.31,We have posted 92 Blog postings.,111,,
761,0.97,5049.31,5059.054,"We have had twice the number of Blog views since we closed the bridge, as we did before that.",111,,
762,0.97,5059.054,5066.928,"We have done many, many interviews and responses to media requests and I think we have met with virtually every Stakeholder group.",111,,
763,0.97,5066.928,5071.866,Some of them multiple times.,111,,
764,0.97,5071.866,5083.478,"We also meet monthly with three advisory groups, including the community task force, employer resource group, a group of large employers we want to encourage to do things like use a shuttle to get there folks to work, once things start opening up.",111,,
765,0.97,5083.478,5091.986,Also a monthly Maritime town hall where we keep the industrial community updated on what is happening.,111,,
766,0.97,5091.986,5096.591,"Next slide, please.",111,,
767,0.97,5096.591,5099.594,"So, Reconnect Seattle is a very important part of this program.",111,,
768,0.97,5099.594,5111.306,"We understand, I understand, because I live here in West Seattle, how important the bridge is to all of the access needs.",111,,
769,0.97,5111.306,5113.475,In the rest of the city.,111,,
770,0.97,5113.475,5117.879,And region.,111,,
771,0.97,5117.879,5125.587,Our goal is to provide the opportunity for similar levels of travel across the--.,111,,
772,0.97,5125.587,5130.225,That of course means a significant change in mood.,111,,
773,0.97,5130.225,5132.093,We have a map that is publicly available.,111,,
774,0.97,5132.093,5136.431,There is the link right there.,111,,
775,0.97,5136.431,5141.803,That shows all of the projects that we are working on.,111,,
776,0.97,5141.803,5145.306,In 2020 we completed all 22 projects that we promise to the community.,111,,
777,0.97,5145.306,5153.948,And in 2021 we are looking forward to deliver 31 projects that are for implementation.,111,,
778,0.97,5153.948,5161.656,"Right now, until the end of this month, we are continuing to collect input from the community for projects that we will construct in early 2022.",111,,
779,0.97,5161.656,5165.059,"Next slide, please.",111,,
780,0.97,5165.059,5173.735,"So, we are Leveraging up to 150 million of the city's financial commitment.",111,,
781,0.97,5173.735,5179.44,You all know very well we have secured 100 million of that and 50 million is unsecured.,111,,
782,0.97,5179.44,5188.883,"We have spent $31 million to date on the stabilization and emergency repairs, as well as traffic mitigation efforts I was talking about.",111,,
783,0.97,5188.883,5193.988,"We are looking forward to Partnering with Washington state, the port of Seattle, and other Stakeholders.",111,,
784,0.97,5193.988,5207.302,"All of the Stakeholders that we work with recognize the load local, and regional need for the bridge.",111,,
785,0.97,5207.302,5208.57,It is not a tough sell.,111,,
786,0.97,5208.57,5211.206,"We are seeking additional Federal funding, including the 15.9 million dollars in grants.",111,,
787,0.97,5211.206,5217.812,And we are right now engaged in putting finishing touches on our U.S. D.O.T.,111,,
788,0.97,5217.812,5220.682,Intro grant application.,111,,
789,0.97,5220.682,5222.684,Which is due here in two days.,111,,
790,0.97,5222.684,5228.523,Next slide.,111,,
791,0.97,5228.523,5231.726,"Thank you so much, city Council, for your letters of support.",111,,
792,0.97,5231.726,5234.229,That was great.,111,,
793,0.97,5234.229,5246.541,"We are requesting between 17 and $21 million, the actual amount depends on details on which costs are Reimbursable, and which are not.",111,,
794,0.97,5246.541,5250.345,We feel that the application fits really nicely into the six objectives.,111,,
795,0.97,5250.345,5256.551,"And so, we are looking forward to being very competitive.",111,,
796,0.97,5256.551,5257.752,In that process.,111,,
797,0.97,5257.752,5262.256,"Next slide, please.",111,,
798,0.97,5262.256,5266.828,"So, I believe that you have the order it's before you.",111,,
799,0.97,5266.828,5268.029,Good.,111,,
800,0.97,5268.029,5277.138,That authorizes the acceptance of that PS RC allocation of $14 million.,111,,
801,0.97,5277.138,5285.179,This includes 6.9 that we previously got but are now Reallocating to the repair project.,111,,
802,0.97,5285.179,5292.253,As well as $7.5 million of hip funds.,111,,

878,0.97,5668.629,5676.771,But I think it is fair to say that the concessions were made in the context of understanding that the West Seattle bridge is crucial to our regional mobility and frame mobility as well.,127,,

923,0.97,5873.434,5880.541,The good news from an accountability perspective is that it is not over even after Council APPROVES the ordinances.,146,,
924,0.97,5880.541,5889.149,Because then the city auditor and the office of Inspector General will continue to review the Technologies after we approve the reports.,146,,

935,0.97,5973.667,5979.773,As remember the executive Overviews identified the enforceable policies and procedures applicable to the Technologies in each of the surveillance impact reports.,147,,
936,0.97,5979.773,5996.557,"I could share my screen if you want, Councilmember Pedersen, and walk through the amendments on the table if you want, for an ordinance relating to surveillance technology implementation; authorizing approval of uses and accepting the surveillance impact report for the Seattle fire Department's use of computer aided dispatch.",147,,

953,0.97,6057.785,6060.654,You will see both one and two repeat for the three Council bills.,151,,
954,0.97,6060.654,6086.18,"Making for technical corrections and then this amendment that would basically be requesting a report on the Metrics that are going to be used as part of the chief technology expert . We call those requested as part of the equity Toolkit in age, but if not been completed yet.",151,,
955,0.97,6086.18,6099.76,"So asking once those are completed, and provided, no later than the third quarter of 2021, the Department would submit basically to the clerk, file a report on what the Metrics were.",151,,

972,0.97,6175.469,6183.477,"Let's go ahead and, are there questions about the underlying bill that we have for either central staff or I.T.",158,,
973,0.97,6183.477,6192.386,"Or city light, before I move the technical amendment one and then amendment number two.",158,,
974,0.97,6192.386,6197.891,And you know you can ask the questions at any time during the process.,158,,
975,0.97,6197.891,6202.062,I am just opening up if there are general underlying questions before we get to the amendments.,158,,
976,0.97,6202.062,6203.397,Okay.,158,,
977,0.97,6203.397,6206.7,"Chair, I may have questions.",159,,
978,0.97,6206.7,6211.204,But I was saving them until after we considered the technical amendments.,159,,
979,0.97,6211.204,6216.677,So I will pull up my notes while we considered the technical amendments.,159,,
980,0.97,6216.677,6220.213,"Yes, that sounds great.",160,,
981,0.97,6220.213,6227.588,So let's try to amend the bill with these two amendments and then we will have another discussion about the bill as amended.,160,,
982,0.97,6227.588,6243.704,"Let me see, so I would like to move to amend Council bill CB 120002 as presented as amendment one on the agenda.",160,,
983,0.97,6243.704,6244.504,Is there a second?,160,,

1021,0.97,6359.353,6361.154,And the amendment is adopted.,184,,
1022,0.97,6361.154,6362.656,Amendment number two.,184,,
1023,0.97,6362.656,6371.498,Let's open this up now for discussion on the bill as amended.,184,,
1024,0.97,6374.901,6380.073,Council President Gonzalez?,185,,
1025,0.97,6380.073,6381.775,My system is a little slow here.,186,,
1026,0.97,6381.775,6383.777,"Which is odd, because I am in the office.",186,,
1027,0.97,6383.777,6387.047,But I am getting the little snail on my desktop here.,186,,
1028,0.97,6387.047,6403.797,"So, really quickly, the CB 120002, I want to make sure that I have a clear understanding of what is included in this particular Council bill.",186,,
1029,0.97,6403.797,6426.119,"I recognize lise Kaye talked about this a little bit, but if you could just sort of Reorient us, now that we have considered the amendment, if you could just describe quickly, what CB 120002, what technologies and which departments are included in this particular bill.",186,,
1030,0.97,6426.119,6428.188,"I would be happy to do that, Councilmember.",187,,
1031,0.97,6428.188,6440.534,"So, CB 120002 is for three city light technologies, all pertaining to checking on current issues.",187,,
1032,0.97,6440.534,6443.036,Basically electricity staffed.,187,,
1033,0.97,6443.036,6455.816,"So a particular team within city light uses these three Technologies together, the binoculars, check meter device and the--to basically investigate potential cases of electricity theft.",187,,
1034,0.97,6455.816,6465.859,"And so adopting this bill before you, would approve the continued use of the Technologies that have been in play for some time.",187,,
1035,0.97,6465.859,6479.239,"I believe some are being updated and we will probably get a revise in the next year to or two, because I think the check meter device in particular is may be replaced by something more technologically advanced.",187,,
1036,0.97,6479.239,6495.989,"In any case, this would approve these three technologies and would accept the reports for those and also the overview of those, which catalogs the enforceable policies and procedures, pertaining to all of those.",187,,
1037,0.97,6495.989,6497.791,"Great, thank you so much.",188,,
1038,0.97,6497.791,6519.88,"When we talked about electricity theft, can you just tell me a little bit more about how this information will be utilized in the context of electricity theft as you characterized it.",188,,
1039,0.97,6519.88,6522.315,"I will turn this over to Michelle, if you don't mind.",189,,
1040,0.97,6522.315,6534.127,"I can speak to my understanding of how it plays out, my understanding, but I think she will have more specific and accurate definitions of how they are actually employed in the field.",189,,
1041,0.97,6534.127,6539.099,Whomever is the appropriate subject matter expert is welcome to answer my question.,190,,
1042,0.97,6539.099,6540.1,Okay.,191,,
1043,0.97,6540.1,6544.838,I think Michelle Vargo is on the line.,191,,
1044,0.97,6544.838,6546.106,Moira is also on the line.,191,,
1045,0.97,6546.106,6548.742,Good morning.,192,,
1046,0.97,6548.742,6549.943,Can I do a quick check?,192,,
1047,0.97,6549.943,6551.611,Can you hear me?,192,,
1048,0.97,6551.611,6552.646,Can you speak up?,193,,
1049,0.97,6552.646,6555.348,We can.,194,,
1050,0.97,6555.348,6555.749,Okay.,195,,
1051,0.97,6555.749,6556.75,I am just double checking.,195,,
1052,0.97,6556.75,6559.052,Is this better?,195,,
1053,0.97,6559.052,6559.452,Yes.,196,,
1054,0.97,6559.452,6559.853,Okay.,197,,
1055,0.97,6559.853,6560.253,Excellent.,197,,
1056,0.97,6560.253,6560.487,Sorry.,197,,
1057,0.97,6560.487,6568.428,"So when we talk about electricity theft, in many cases this would come in as a safety issue.",197,,
1058,0.97,6568.428,6574.134,We might notice that it seems like the meter was tempered for whatever reason.,197,,
1059,0.97,6574.134,6582.576,So we might want to try to investigate that site to make sure how much electricity is going to the site.,197,,
1060,0.97,6582.576,6584.778,Then determine maybe how the system was tempered with.,197,,
1061,0.97,6584.778,6601.428,In other cases you might just want to see how much electricity is flowing through and if it was tempered but might not prevent a safety issue from someone just passing by was able to pick up on and report.,197,,
1062,0.97,6601.428,6609.703,"So, these Technologies has a one, the binoculars, pretty self-explanatory.",197,,
1063,0.97,6609.703,6616.309,Would just be trying to observe if there is a safety issue on the meter or some equipment Tampered with.,197,,
1064,0.97,6616.309,6618.111,They are not taking pictures or anything like that.,197,,
1065,0.97,6618.111,6620.78,"And then with the other technologies, they really are just reporting.",197,,
1066,0.97,6620.78,6622.816,Reporting on electricity flow.,197,,
1067,0.97,6622.816,6626.82,So they don't actually carry any customer data on them.,197,,
1068,0.97,6626.82,6634.394,"The electricians go out, they monitor the Cable that is going to the resident or what it might be.",197,,
1069,0.97,6634.394,6635.628,It takes a reading.,197,,
1070,0.97,6635.628,6640.5,Then we document the reading on our computers.,197,,
1071,0.97,6640.5,6651.144,That is how we use those technologies and make a determination if this does not seem in alignment with the way the original configuration was meant to be.,197,,
1072,0.97,6651.144,6654.848,Or if there is an actual safety hazard that we need to address to the public.,197,,
1073,0.97,6654.848,6657.45,"Thank you, Michelle.",198,,
1074,0.97,6657.45,6665.458,Does this actually refer to the electricity theft?,198,,
1075,0.97,6665.458,6667.327,As a concept at all.,198,,
1076,0.97,6667.327,6684.277,"I am looking at the Council central staff memo drafted by lise Kaye and it looks like the issue around, you know, identifying the electricity theft was not written about in the memorandum.",198,,
1077,0.97,6684.277,6693.086,So I am wondering if the issue was flagged or at all addressed in the context of it?,198,,
1078,0.97,6693.086,6698.792,I can answer how we Crafted it.,199,,
1079,0.97,6698.792,6702.228,"It was put to us, this is part of current diversion investigation.",199,,
1080,0.97,6702.228,6706.166,Which can happen for a variety of reasons.,199,,
1081,0.97,6706.166,6706.8,Got it.,200,,
1082,0.97,6706.8,6708.802,"Damaged equipment, something is happening.",201,,
1083,0.97,6708.802,6713.306,"I don't think it is always the assumption that it is a theft situation, although that is a scenario.",201,,
1084,0.97,6713.306,6716.976,Does that help?,201,,
1085,0.97,6716.976,6717.377,Yes.,202,,
1086,0.97,6717.377,6725.118,"The terminology being used is diversion but within the concept of diversion, electricity theft is part of that.",202,,
1087,0.97,6725.118,6726.586,Could be part of the reason.,203,,
1088,0.97,6726.586,6726.986,Could be.,203,,
1089,0.97,6726.986,6727.387,Okay.,204,,
1090,0.97,6727.387,6732.525,"In the instances, I am focusing on theft.",204,,
1091,0.97,6732.525,6737.397,"I just want to understand get to the point here, is the purpose of that for enforcement?",204,,
1092,0.97,6737.397,6758.051,"If so, what kinds of enforcement are going, what kind of enforcement actions are going to be triggered if, for example, Seattle city light CONFIRMS that there has been electricity theft.",204,,
1093,0.97,6758.051,6764.457,"So, in some cases we actually work in conjunction with the police Department on some issues.",205,,
1094,0.97,6764.457,6772.065,I think those are the Nefarious situations.,205,,
1095,0.97,6772.065,6776.035,I do think there is current diversion that happens just because a piece of equipment is not happening correctly.,205,,
1096,0.97,6776.035,6780.473,In those cases it starts a conversation with a customer about just the bill.,205,,
1097,0.97,6780.473,6791.651,"I think it can take a couple different paths, but I do think that if there is someone purposely stealing electricity, we will still have a conversation to recover the funds.",205,,
1098,0.97,6791.651,6796.856,And most of this is addressed in SMC and Department policies.,205,,
1099,0.97,6796.856,6804.197,"They need to be updated, just because as it was pointed out in a previous meeting, we do have our advanced meter technology now.",205,,
1100,0.97,6804.197,6808.768,Those are going to play a role in reducing our needs for the Technologies.,205,,
1101,0.97,6808.768,6814.841,Because the meters to give the ability to identify the issues sooner.,205,,
1102,0.97,6814.841,6828.521,And so therefore not letting a prolonged duration of the occurrence take place and then catching up with the billing I would have to take place.,205,,
1103,0.97,6828.521,6837.297,"We would have to know pretty soon, or once the theft is occurring or the diversion is occurring.",205,,
1104,0.97,6837.297,6853.012,"And this is,--, I want to review the information specifically taken about data sharing.",206,,
1105,0.97,6853.012,6861.854,Specifically data logging or request for data related to enforcement.,206,,
1106,0.97,6861.854,6865.458,"When a report is sent in conjunction with law enforcement, it does not include any consumption information.",206,,
1107,0.97,6865.458,6867.961,This is per this and the Department policy.,206,,
1108,0.97,6867.961,6873.533,"Law enforcement would have to submit a request for specific records, if they need that support in the investigation.",206,,
1109,0.97,6873.533,6882.742,But that would be provided pursuant to a subpoena or the request with the public disclosure law.,206,,
1110,0.97,6882.742,6893.553,"When they require evidence, for further proceedings and aggravated cases, when large sums of energy have been stolen or a safety risk to public.",206,,
1111,0.97,6893.553,6906.866,There is the executive overview to outline the situations in which Seattle city light participants will assist law enforcement with these types of requests.,206,,
1112,0.97,6906.866,6910.47,You were anticipating my next question.,207,,
1113,0.97,6910.47,6913.573,Thank you for doing A. so you are referring to attachment four on the agenda.,207,,
1114,0.97,6913.573,6918.478,Which is titled current diversion Technologies executive overview.,207,,
1115,0.97,6918.478,6943.77,"And I see some information on page, some information on page 3. that I think the data shared and inaccuracy is primarily shared on page 4, where it says quote, data is elected and maintained for Seattle city light use and may only be shared with outside entities for the purposes of law enforcement or legal action by the relevant jurisdictional authority.",207,,
1116,0.97,6943.77,6949.342,"The policy is formally laid out in the Seattle city light procedure, etc.",207,,
1117,0.97,6949.342,6954.013,So I just want to really Hone in on this.,207,,
1118,0.97,6954.013,6954.847,This concept.,207,,
1119,0.97,6954.847,6957.517,I think it is important.,207,,
1120,0.97,6957.517,6963.056,"So, so I want to make sure I understand what I'm reading here.",207,,
1121,0.97,6963.056,6978.771,"In the instance in which law enforcement is doing the investigation, then they would have to think of going to Seattle city light under the public disclosure law to request power records.",207,,
1122,0.97,6978.771,6993.119,Or they would have to have a subpoena that is based on probable cause consistent with Washington public disclosure law.,207,,
1123,0.97,6993.119,7000.86,"In other words, you are not going to be tipping off the Seattle PD that there might be electricity theft issues.",207,,
1124,0.97,7000.86,7006.599,It is the street runs the other way.,207,,
1125,0.97,7006.599,7007.834,And my understanding that correctly?,207,,
1126,0.97,7007.834,7009.068,That is correct.,208,,
1127,0.97,7009.068,7012.505,Okay.,209,,
1128,0.97,7012.505,7012.972,Thank you.,209,,
1129,0.97,7012.972,7014.574,I have no other questions on this.,209,,
1130,0.97,7014.574,7017.21,Thank you Council President.,210,,
1131,0.97,7017.21,7022.515,"Councilmembers, any other questions for this technology?",210,,
1132,0.97,7022.515,7031.724,"One of the benefits of adopting the ordinance here, it does incorporate that executive overview into the policy.",210,,
1133,0.97,7031.724,7036.629,That is helpful.,210,,
1134,0.97,7036.629,7039.332,I am looking to see if there are other questions.,210,,
1135,0.97,7039.332,7045.538,I do not see any further questions on this particular bill as amended.,210,,
1136,0.97,7045.538,7059.852,We will go ahead and I asked the clerk to please call the role on the committee recommendation that the Council bill CB 120002 pass as amended.,210,,

1269,0.97,7593.986,7607.8,There is a question regarding whether or not the fire Department has technical controls in place to limit the scope of SPD's access to the fire Department CAD data.,269,,
1270,0.97,7607.8,7620.112,And then another question about the understanding that there are a large number of administrators with access to the CAD system.,269,,
1271,0.97,7620.112,7639.198,And whether or not there is the ability to have more controls on the number of people who have access and whether or not there is required training for those who do.,269,,

1275,0.97,7654.046,7660.719,"So I think there is a little bit of a misunderstanding when it comes to Admin roles, when it comes to CAD.",271,,
1276,0.97,7660.719,7664.023,There is only several Admin and those are actually in Seattle I.T.,271,,
1277,0.97,7664.023,7669.128,And they work on the Seattle fire Department CAD technology.,271,,
1278,0.97,7669.128,7672.197,What is true is that every Seattle fire Department employee has access to the data.,271,,
1279,0.97,7672.197,7673.832,To the CAD system.,271,,
1280,0.97,7673.832,7679.938,The reason for that is it is so fundamental for just about everything we do.,271,,
1281,0.97,7679.938,7689.748,"From scheduling, resource allocation, hr, it is very important that everybody in the Seattle fire Department has access to the data.",271,,
1282,0.97,7689.748,7691.383,Readily and daily.,271,,
1283,0.97,7691.383,7697.756,"And then to address your point about access to the police, we do not provide direct access to the Seattle PD.",271,,
1284,0.97,7697.756,7702.394,It is only Seattle fire Department employees or the Seattle I.T.,271,,
1285,0.97,7702.394,7704.897,Folks that are the Admin.,271,,
1286,0.97,7704.897,7715.207,"So, similar somewhat to the Seattle city light, where the police or law enforcement has to submit a request to get the data, we do not push to them.",271,,
1287,0.97,7715.207,7716.008,They come to us.,271,,

1294,0.97,7736.295,7738.13,I would have to look into that.,273,,
1295,0.97,7738.13,7742.434,I would have to speak with the more technical experts on that.,273,,
1296,0.97,7742.434,7744.536,So I do not want to give you bad information.,273,,
1297,0.97,7744.536,7759.451,"I appreciate that . I think the concern with the large number of people having access to it, that having more controls could improve the Cyber security of the system.",274,,
1298,0.97,7759.451,7760.719,Appreciate you getting back to me.,274,,
1299,0.97,7760.719,7761.587,Absolutely.,275,,

1307,0.97,7791.383,7799.892,I was following up on some but Councilmember Herbold got to the root of my question.,277,,

1313,0.97,7842.501,7850.943,Are there security concerns from your standpoint about having this publicly available Online?,277,,
1314,0.97,7850.943,7854.813,Are there retention parameters around this data?,277,,
1315,0.97,7854.813,7855.847,Can you share with that.,277,,
1316,0.97,7855.847,7856.248,Sure.,278,,
1317,0.97,7856.248,7864.756,I'm not aware of requirements when it comes to a minimum or a suggested maximum data retention for the Online data.,278,,
1318,0.97,7864.756,7874.566,"I can tell you that the real data, what we have on the open data portal is CAD data.",278,,
1319,0.97,7874.566,7883.175,It is essentially taking information we determined to not be a privacy risk and pushed it out to the public.,278,,
1320,0.97,7883.175,7886.912,"So to answer your questions, I do not see concerns with the data we currently publish Online.",278,,
1321,0.97,7886.912,7888.18,"Or to pulse point, for instance.",278,,
1322,0.97,7888.18,7895.654,"It does not contain any PII, personally identifiable affirmation.",278,,
1323,0.97,7895.654,7904.196,"The only concern I would have I suppose is if someone could use the data and say, somehow combine it with a different data set.",278,,
1324,0.97,7904.196,7911.703,Then potentially you could try to dig up maybe a response history to a particular location.,278,,
1325,0.97,7911.703,7915.407,But again there is no PII or to tell essentially who that person is based on the data.,278,,
1326,0.97,7915.407,7922.047,"And then to go back to your last question, I am not aware of any retention policies of that sort of data.",278,,
1327,0.97,7922.047,7924.082,Thank you.,279,,
1328,0.97,7924.082,7941.033,"And just to tease that out one step forward, it sounds like in your internal whatever computer you are using to review your CAD data, internally has more information that you are pushing out to the general public.",279,,
1329,0.97,7941.033,7941.8,Is that correct?,279,,
1330,0.97,7941.8,7942.935,That is correct.,280,,
1331,0.97,7942.935,7944.436,Great.,281,,
1332,0.97,7944.436,7956.348,"And for the more detailed version of being able to view the CADE--CAD data, are there two factor authentication's required?",281,,
1333,0.97,7956.348,7960.652,Is it limited to government computers?,281,,
1334,0.97,7960.652,7966.058,How are you creating that security perimeter around the more robust asset?,281,,
1335,0.97,7966.058,7969.061,Sure.,282,,
1336,0.97,7969.061,7975.4,"So at least when it comes to the two factor authentication, I will have to get back to you on some of the details with that.",282,,
1337,0.97,7975.4,7982.975,I can tell you that the CAD data is only available to Seattle fire Department employees via their desktop.,282,,
1338,0.97,7982.975,7990.549,But the data is also included with the mobile data terminal in the fire trucks and other rigs that go well.,282,,
1339,0.97,7990.549,7994.319,But I will have to follow-up to get you the information on the two factor authentication.,282,,
1340,0.97,7994.319,7996.288,"Great, thank you.",283,,
1341,0.97,7996.288,7998.156,Thanks Councilmember.,284,,
1342,0.97,7998.156,8006.098,"All right colleagues, if there are no further Questios we will go ahead and move to approve the amended bill.",284,,
1343,0.97,8006.098,8014.906,Will be clerk please call the role on the committee recommendation that CB 120003 pass as amended.,284,,
1344,0.97,8014.906,8016.007,Gonzalez.,285,,
1345,0.97,8016.007,8018.176,Aye.,286,,
1346,0.97,8018.176,8019.478,Herbold.,287,,
1347,0.97,8019.478,8021.513,Yes.,288,,
1348,0.97,8021.513,8025.417,Morales.,289,,
1349,0.97,8029.755,8033.325,Councilmember Morales?,289,,
1350,0.97,8033.325,8034.526,Strauss.,290,,
1351,0.97,8034.526,8036.828,Yes.,291,,
1352,0.97,8036.828,8039.698,Chair Pedersen.,292,,
1353,0.97,8039.698,8041.433,Four in favor.,292,,
1354,0.97,8041.433,8042.934,None opposed.,292,,
1355,0.97,8042.934,8043.735,Thank you.,293,,
1356,0.97,8043.735,8051.81,The motion carries an the bill to be amended will be sent to the March 22nd council meeting for final consideration.,293,,
1357,0.97,8051.81,8062.521,"The next item, item 7 on the agenda is related to the police technology and the clerk can go ahead and read the title into the record.",293,,
1358,0.97,8062.521,8066.224,But we will be holding it until April 7th.,293,,
1359,0.97,8066.224,8069.861,But please go ahead and read into the record.,293,,
1360,0.97,8069.861,8074.065,"Agenda item seven, CB 120004.",294,,
1361,0.97,8074.065,8085.877,An ordinance relating to surveillance technology implementation; authorizing approval of uses and accepting surveillance impact reports for the Seattle police Department's use of surveillance Technologies.,294,,
1362,0.97,8085.877,8091.383,"For briefing, discussion, and possible vote.",294,,
1363,0.97,8091.383,8091.783,Thank you.,295,,
1364,0.97,8091.783,8099.825,"Colleagues, as we discussed earlier, we will give everyone more time on these SPD Technologies.",295,,
1365,0.97,8099.825,8102.861,"We will have the item in the committee for a third time on Wednesday, April 7th.",295,,
1366,0.97,8102.861,8109.801,At that time we can vote on any amendments and Ideally vote the amended bills out of committee.,295,,
1367,0.97,8109.801,8127.319,"As we discussed the SPD Technologies today, let's start to maybe consider possible amendments, but we do want to get the amendments to central staff, lise Kaye, no later than Tuesday, March 23rd.",295,,
1368,0.97,8127.319,8131.623,The amendments will need to undergo essentially two legal reviews.,295,,
1369,0.97,8131.623,8143.835,A standard legal review like we have with any amendment and a supplemental legal review to assess whether they might materially assess with the decree over the PD.,295,,
1370,0.97,8143.835,8145.337,I have alerted the city attorney's office.,295,,
1371,0.97,8145.337,8159.05,It is possible that amendments may have no material impact but out of abundance of caution we will have the Attorney office do the initial screening for this to make sure there are no unintended consequences related to the decree.,295,,
1372,0.97,8159.05,8166.658,"Because the Technologies are not directly tied to consent decree requirements, it is possible there will be no issues.",295,,
1373,0.97,8166.658,8168.527,We don't know until we see the amendment.,295,,
1374,0.97,8168.527,8173.832,We are encouraging you to get the amendments into lise Kaye by next Tuesday.,295,,
1375,0.97,8173.832,8182.374,"And I will be working with central staff and potentially break the ordinance into multiple, separate Council bills.",295,,
1376,0.97,8182.374,8189.981,"That way if we hit any, if we want to hold one later, we can move forward with the others.",295,,
1377,0.97,8189.981,8202.36,"So you might see them reintroduced, the single bill reintroduced to five, one for each of technologies, so we have more flexibility and can be more nimble on April 7th.",295,,
1378,0.97,8202.36,8202.561,Okay.,295,,
1379,0.97,8202.561,8212.704,"Well, lise Kaye, if you don't mind giving us the overview of these again, I would appreciate it.",295,,
1380,0.97,8212.704,8220.679,"And the amendments, the only two that were Online were just the same technical corrections, and information, the information on the equity assessment.",295,,
1381,0.97,8220.679,8229.087,"But we expect more amendments to come to lise Kaye next week, to discuss on April 7.",295,,
1382,0.97,8229.087,8229.688,Thank you.,295,,
1383,0.97,8229.688,8229.854,I.,295,,
1384,0.97,8229.854,8239.931,So with your permission I would like to go ahead and share my screen and go back to the slide deck to just walk through the five Technologies.,296,,
1385,0.97,8239.931,8243.635,I think that it helps organize the thinking more because there are five Sir here under consideration.,296,,
1386,0.97,8243.635,8246.905,So let me just get this shared with you.,296,,
1387,0.97,8246.905,8249.341,Is that looking write to you now?,296,,
1388,0.97,8249.341,8251.009,Everybody can see that?,296,,
1389,0.97,8251.009,8254.245,Not yet.,297,,
1390,0.97,8254.245,8257.115,"Because I have to hit ""share ."" okay.",298,,
1391,0.97,8257.115,8260.051,Great.,299,,
1392,0.97,8260.051,8261.253,That should be on.,300,,
1393,0.97,8261.253,8264.556,I will jump forward to the five police Department Technologies here.,300,,
1394,0.97,8264.556,8274.199,"So, the five that are under consideration are for automated license plate reading, for the parking enforcement system that uses the automated reader system.",300,,
1395,0.97,8274.199,8276.635,From a different vendor.,300,,
1396,0.97,8276.635,8283.375,"The computer aided dispatch, with what we just talked about with the fire Department.",300,,
1397,0.97,8283.375,8285.644,"Coplogic, the program I walk through in a little bit.",300,,
1398,0.97,8285.644,8287.178,And the 911 logging recorder.,300,,
1399,0.97,8287.178,8309.0,"So, the license plate readers, as you heard last week, will help with the Edification of stolen vehicles, help you find amber alert and silver alert individuals, and vehicles that would be wanted in conjunction with monies or other investigations.",300,,
1400,0.97,8309.0,8318.61,"I will just do the description right now, rather than walk through my briefing, if that works for you, chair.",300,,
1401,0.97,8318.61,8319.01,Yes.,301,,
1402,0.97,8319.01,8340.031,"I will just skip the slides and it is used for parking assistance, enforcement so if you have multiple Infractions, parking Infractions, they will help you identify the individuals.",301,,
1403,0.97,8340.031,8350.342,"The information, that is collected from the readers for parking enforcement, just a second.",301,,
1404,0.97,8350.342,8351.776,"My cat, Jessica, take the cat out.",301,,
1405,0.97,8351.776,8354.646,[Laughter] sorry.,301,,
1406,0.97,8354.646,8357.115,A cat interruption there.,301,,
1407,0.97,8357.115,8359.551,We need cat prevention technology.,302,,
1408,0.97,8359.551,8362.353,I think it is called a door.,303,,
1409,0.97,8362.353,8363.621,"Anyhow, I apologize for that.",303,,
1410,0.97,8363.621,8378.77,"So the parking enforcement systems did affirm their license plate reader system is updated or Uploaded at the end of each shift, to the Database shared with control.",303,,
1411,0.97,8378.77,8388.98,"The next technology, is the computer aided dispatch, which I do not think I need to describe in much detail here.",303,,
1412,0.97,8388.98,8396.688,"It is what the fire Department does with its Computer-Aided dispatch, and supporting the 911 calls.",303,,
1413,0.97,8396.688,8402.093,"The Coplogic, the system that has two different applications.",303,,
1414,0.97,8402.093,8414.205,One is where individuals can call in and report low-level crimes on a police recorded number that they use to submit for an insurance claim.,303,,
1415,0.97,8414.205,8436.728,And then the second track is the retail theft recording where businesses can call or can report potential Shoplifters and start the process for reporting those crimes and then the courts will decide or the city attorney's office will decide whether to file charges against the cases.,303,,
1416,0.97,8436.728,8449.14,"And the fifth one is the logging recorder, basically used to record all telephone calls that come into the 911 center and the traffic between the Dispatchers and the patrol officers.",303,,
1417,0.97,8449.14,8458.116,So those are the five Technologies in the sum Valence report and executive Overviews that would accompany each of the Technologies.,303,,
1418,0.97,8458.116,8465.056,Thank you very much for the overview of the five SPD Technologies.,304,,
1419,0.97,8465.056,8481.039,"The existing Technologies before us is part of the surveillance impact report and we do have again with us, this Committee, Captain Paul Mcdonagh from Seattle PD and then also the information technology Department might be able to answer some questions.",304,,
1420,0.97,8481.039,8484.642,If you have questions for lise Kaye or I.T.,304,,
1421,0.97,8484.642,8490.982,"Or SPD, that you did not get to ask the last time, please go ahead and ask the questions now.",304,,
1422,0.97,8490.982,8502.76,Obviously feel free to give a preview of thoughts of what you might want to explore for amendments on April 7th.,304,,
1423,0.97,8502.76,8505.997,I am happy to summarize a little bit of what I heard at the last committee.,304,,
1424,0.97,8505.997,8510.902,And talking to individuals between now and then.,304,,
1425,0.97,8510.902,8515.406,Between then and now.,304,,
1426,0.97,8515.406,8519.878,"But, please, Councilmember Herbold, any comments?",304,,
1427,0.97,8519.878,8521.312,Sure.,305,,
1428,0.97,8521.312,8523.014,I will kick us off here.,305,,
1429,0.97,8523.014,8568.86,"So, stuff I wanted to get an understanding, as it relates to the plate reader, the efficacy, I understand that the analysis that the police Department does shows that over a nine-month period there were 2.4 million license plates scanned and as a result of the scanning of the 2.4 million license plates over a nine-month period of time, there were 124 hits.",305,,
1430,0.97,8568.86,8586.377,And that apparently is in effectiveness rate that is significantly lower than a similar analysis of this data from 2013.,305,,
1431,0.97,8586.377,8600.358,"In 2013, apparently the number of hits was 0.25%, under the most recent analysis, it is now 0.005%.",305,,
1432,0.97,8600.358,8623.815,"And I am just wondering, what did we learn from assuming that analysis I am sharing is accurate, what did we learn about the effectiveness of this program with larger numbers of license plates being scanned?",305,,
1433,0.97,8623.815,8639.597,"And resulting in fewer findings of individuals who are, that SPD is looking for.",305,,
1434,0.97,8639.597,8642.834,So Captain Paul Mcdonagh is on the line with us here.,306,,
1435,0.97,8642.834,8644.235,To answer that.,306,,
1436,0.97,8644.235,8650.842,"Good morning Councilmembers, 27 with Seattle police here.",307,,
1437,0.97,8650.842,8658.416,I appreciate the fact that you had the studies and I will be honest with the first one I didn't have that data and I apologize.,307,,
1438,0.97,8658.416,8665.356,"But in terms of hit ratio, if you look at your numbers, I do not think it does it justice.",307,,
1439,0.97,8665.356,8671.129,One of the things that it does is allows us to locate the vehicles that I've been stolen by anyone in our community and return them.,307,,
1440,0.97,8671.129,8678.87,"Additionally, the information does not often come in in what I would call the TV style.",307,,
1441,0.97,8678.87,8682.34,Like less than one hour we will know all the vehicles and everyone that is a player.,307,,
1442,0.97,8682.34,8683.841,Many of our cases come in overtime.,307,,
1443,0.97,8683.841,8689.08,"So people collect the information, track down the vehicle, we get a license plate and they publish it.",307,,
1444,0.97,8689.08,8700.091,"We can use it for one, types of crimes of progress and type stuff.",307,,
1445,0.97,8700.091,8708.8,"In terms of returning vehicles back to the property owners and/or recovering the vehicle as evidence, to hold criminals accountable for the crimes.",307,,
1446,0.97,8708.8,8719.21,"The good thing there is even though it is a low ratio, we have increased our population from 2013, I think you said, to 2000 20.",307,,
1447,0.97,8719.21,8719.61,Eight 2020.,307,,
1448,0.97,8719.61,8722.013,You will get more reads.,307,,
1449,0.97,8722.013,8730.088,"Growing through the pandemic, people, you would think they would know if their car was gone.",307,,
1450,0.97,8730.088,8731.722,But they were not going out I.,307,,
1451,0.97,8731.722,8742.734,"I believe the numbers will probably be a little bit higher, but again for the value that it gives for us, for evidence, and recovering the property, it is valuable for our citizens.",307,,
1452,0.97,8742.734,8744.402,Thank you.,308,,
1453,0.97,8744.402,8748.639,And the other question that I have relates to Coplogic.,308,,
1454,0.97,8748.639,8765.256,I think there is a perception that the use of the technology somehow grant security within stores some additional authority to do something that they cannot do otherwise.,308,,
1455,0.97,8765.256,8767.992,And I do not think that is accurate.,308,,
1456,0.97,8767.992,8781.172,I do not think that it is the technology that makes it possible for store security to keep somebody on site until an officer comes.,308,,
1457,0.97,8781.172,8786.677,I think to a certain extent they have the ability to do that already.,308,,
1458,0.97,8786.677,8788.946,But maybe you could talk a little bit more about that.,308,,
1459,0.97,8788.946,8798.756,"There is a concern that we are, that the technology itself is allowing for the Deppe utilization, basically, of store security.",308,,
1460,0.97,8798.756,8801.192,First of all to buy for the question.,309,,
1461,0.97,8801.192,8805.062,I agree with you that it is an accurate.,309,,
1462,0.97,8805.062,8808.9,The store security does have a right to protect their property and lawfully detained within reason.,309,,
1463,0.97,8808.9,8812.17,Those who are expected of committing a crime.,309,,
1464,0.97,8812.17,8818.409,"However, what Coplogic allows us to do is reduce staff hours.",309,,
1465,0.97,8818.409,8829.02,"Instead of having to send a uniformed officer to the site, and take all that time to collect evidence and so forth, we have been able to shift that to the security loss prevention officers.",309,,
1466,0.97,8829.02,8836.127,In that they still have to swear out an affidavit about the Reasonableness of what the crime was.,309,,
1467,0.97,8836.127,8840.832,And provide evidence.,309,,
1468,0.97,8840.832,8844.669,When they submit that it is not actually in the system until a detective reviews the whole thing.,309,,
1469,0.97,8844.669,8864.922,"And if there is anything missing in there for probable cause or evidence that shows that this individual committed that intended Kriebel reported crime, then the detective will send it back and it will not even come back into the system get that officer chose not to respond then it automatically Deletes after, I want to say 120 days.",309,,
1470,0.97,8864.922,8867.425,I think.,309,,
1471,0.97,8867.425,8871.462,It gives people time to have communication back and forth.,309,,
1472,0.97,8871.462,8883.341,"But the detective that reviews it insures, like an officer would, had they gone there to make sure there is elements of a crime that we can in turn look into and take to the Prosecutor for consideration of charges.",309,,
1473,0.97,8883.341,8888.479,If we only forwarded then the Prosecutor makes the final determination.,309,,
1474,0.97,8888.479,8895.486,"Then I think the technology allows us under the last study, to reduce 20,000 staff officers hours.",309,,
1475,0.97,8895.486,8902.994,Keeping patrol officers doing what they can do and not going to the store and tying up a person in custody.,309,,
1476,0.97,8902.994,8914.906,"It also allows the loss provincial--loss prevention officer if they have identification, they can reach it a lot sooner.",309,,
1477,0.97,8923.147,8925.683,A dramatic pause.,310,,
1478,0.97,8925.683,8926.117,Sorry.,311,,
1479,0.97,8926.117,8927.518,Thank you for your patience.,311,,
1480,0.97,8927.518,8933.624,"Sometimes it is difficult to switch screens, but thank you for the answer.",311,,
1481,0.97,8933.624,8996.721,"Related to the ability of store owners to use the Online feature and the requirement that crimes are reported using that Online feature before acting upon those reports, have we considered collecting any demographic data about the individuals that store owners are calling in, so that we can have an understanding of whether or not there is any disparity in enforcement, much like we do with the citations that police officers make.",311,,
1482,0.97,8996.721,9003.194,We collect demographic information so that we can analyze it and learn from it.,311,,
1483,0.97,9003.194,9009.7,I am wondering if that is something that is possible to do with this system as well.,311,,
1484,0.97,9009.7,9019.877,All of that item that we can require legally is in the report.,312,,
1485,0.97,9019.877,9031.088,"And to clarify, just to process, the loss prevention officer does get a manual on what they are required to put in.",312,,
1486,0.97,9031.088,9032.99,And answer specific questions outlining the crime.,312,,
1487,0.97,9032.99,9041.999,"And the other thing, like if they are following out the report like a personal officer, they have to swear that the information they are reporting is accurately correct.",312,,
1488,0.97,9041.999,9046.837,Or they are subject to criminal charges for false reporting and things like that.,312,,
1489,0.97,9046.837,9049.34,Possible even perjury.,312,,
1490,0.97,9049.34,9058.215,"But I do think that we could happily work with someone from I.T., to try to figure out how to collect some of that data.",312,,
1491,0.97,9058.215,9059.417,Thank you.,313,,
1492,0.97,9059.417,9062.052,Appreciate it.,313,,
1493,0.97,9062.052,9067.625,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,314,,
1494,0.97,9067.625,9069.093,"Colleagues, any other questions?",314,,
1495,0.97,9069.093,9077.568,"This isn't the last time you will be able to ask questions, but I wanted to get on the table if you have other questions.",314,,
1496,0.97,9077.568,9080.571,"And since we have captain Paul Mcdonagh here, as well as I.T.",314,,
1497,0.97,9080.571,9084.875,And central staff.,314,,
1498,0.97,9084.875,9101.792,I do want to raise a question that we have heard about parking enforcement folks sharing information with the rest of the police Department.,314,,
1499,0.97,9101.792,9113.471,"In terms, are you able to speak to that a little bit about how parking enforcement Anoraks or shares data with the regular patrol officers.",314,,
1500,0.97,9113.471,9118.609,For example.,314,,
1501,0.97,9118.609,9119.477,A little bit.,315,,
1502,0.97,9119.477,9122.58,"And since the last meeting, I made sure to get some clarification on some data.",315,,
1503,0.97,9122.58,9141.232,"So, poorest--parking enforcement officers are locating the time of the license plate that was read and then keep vehicles moving and if they write the citations or issue Infractions, we do not get any of that data.",315,,
1504,0.97,9141.232,9144.001,That is held complete leave Ipp owes.,315,,
1505,0.97,9144.001,9150.674,"The PDO readings, that does go into a clever ignition point.",315,,
1506,0.97,9150.674,9161.452,"But for an officer to actually read the data, you were talking earlier about the two factor authentication for some of the systems.",315,,
1507,0.97,9161.452,9172.73,"We have it for SPD to get in and once they are in they log into a specific system and put their name, the case number, and the crime itself that they are suspected of.",315,,
1508,0.97,9172.73,9174.165,Then do the research for the license plate.,315,,
1509,0.97,9174.165,9183.44,That is another way that we are using the accountability process to ensure we are not abusing the information in the system.,315,,
1510,0.97,9183.44,9185.075,So yes they can access that.,315,,
1511,0.97,9185.075,9189.58,But it also has to be for a criminal offense.,315,,
1512,0.97,9189.58,9202.593,"If it is being used, hopefully Únot, but if used for personal Úuse or something else, there, other than their official duties, then they are subject to discipline under law.",315,,
1513,0.97,9202.593,9205.262,Thank you for explaining that.,316,,
1514,0.97,9205.262,9207.298,Councilmember Strauss?,316,,
1515,0.97,9207.298,9210.801,Thank you chair and thank you captain Paul Mcdonagh.,317,,
1516,0.97,9210.801,9217.441,Some of my questions will be extensions of what Councilmember Herbold was asking.,317,,
1517,0.97,9217.441,9222.813,My apologies for maybe asking the simple questions that have been addressed in the memos and the presentation.,317,,
1518,0.97,9222.813,9227.518,It is just information that I want to focus clearly and on.,317,,
1519,0.97,9227.518,9237.728,"For the license plate readers themselves, is the primary application of the license plate reader just with parking enforcement?",317,,
1520,0.97,9237.728,9240.798,Or is it also while the patrol car is on the road?,317,,
1521,0.97,9240.798,9242.633,Driving around.,317,,
1522,0.97,9242.633,9248.405,"We have a number of patrol cars that have it, although not all of the patrol cars have it.",318,,
1523,0.97,9248.405,9257.314,"When they are not in the shop, because again the technology goes up and down, we average two per Precinct, except for the North, because of the geographic size.",318,,
1524,0.97,9257.314,9259.049,They have three.,318,,
1525,0.97,9259.049,9268.058,"Check that I know at least two vehicles were in for maintenance and where they came from, I cannot answer.",318,,
1526,0.97,9268.058,9270.327,Those units do in fact you some.,318,,
1527,0.97,9270.327,9271.362,Thank you.,319,,
1528,0.97,9271.362,9271.962,That is helpful.,319,,
1529,0.97,9271.962,9282.573,"And so for the Non-Parking enforcement, for the patrol cars that have it embedded, what is the primary function?",319,,
1530,0.97,9282.573,9287.678,"Is it just to increase efficiency as you drive around to locate, as you mentioned, stolen cars?",319,,
1531,0.97,9287.678,9291.849,Maybe people that you are attempting to contact.,319,,
1532,0.97,9291.849,9296.687,Can you help me understand what the policy reason is.,319,,
1533,0.97,9296.687,9300.324,So you are half right on that.,320,,
1534,0.97,9300.324,9309.667,"Do we use it for wanted vehicles, Solen vehicles, those vehicles with warrants associated to the license plate.",320,,
1535,0.97,9309.667,9318.208,If I have a car and commit a crime and it might be tagged to the license plate and you can check it out.,320,,
1536,0.97,9318.208,9323.213,"But in terms of looking at cars, they cannot just run a license plate and say, I want to talk to you.",320,,
1537,0.97,9323.213,9324.214,The officer cannot do that.,320,,
1538,0.97,9324.214,9327.284,There has to be something in the system to give them a read or hit.,320,,
1539,0.97,9327.284,9330.12,A casual term.,320,,
1540,0.97,9330.12,9332.189,"And it says Hey, this person is a missing person.",320,,
1541,0.97,9332.189,9334.425,Out of Spokane.,320,,
1542,0.97,9334.425,9337.027,We get a number of those and they are updated into the system.,320,,
1543,0.97,9337.027,9347.337,"So if the license plate reader sees the vehicle, of the license plate, it will say that this vehicle is listed as a missing person out of Spokane.",320,,
1544,0.97,9347.337,9347.938,Or endangered person.,320,,
1545,0.97,9347.938,9349.54,Or something like that.,320,,
1546,0.97,9349.54,9356.313,"Other than that it really just pretty much comes back for the patrol officers, the fact that it is wanted or not wanted.",320,,
1547,0.97,9356.313,9360.751,If it is not wanted then it does not come up with anything.,320,,
1548,0.97,9360.751,9364.855,"Thank you, Captain.",321,,
1549,0.97,9364.855,9369.46,"Does that mean that as the patrol car is on patrol, it is automatically reading the license plates ahead and behind it?",321,,
1550,0.97,9369.46,9372.863,Or do you have to activate the technology?,321,,
1551,0.97,9372.863,9375.032,You have to turn the system on.,322,,
1552,0.97,9375.032,9377.334,And--sorry.,322,,
1553,0.97,9377.334,9380.671,Go ahead.,322,,
1554,0.97,9380.671,9386.043,So it functions similarly to a patrol officer behind a car than punching in the license plate.,323,,
1555,0.97,9386.043,9387.244,"Yes, sir.",324,,
1556,0.97,9387.244,9397.287,And all of the officers that are assigned the vehicle are going through the internal training classes.,324,,
1557,0.97,9397.287,9397.688,Okay.,325,,
1558,0.97,9397.688,9403.394,And are you able to speak on the parking enforcement aspect or do I need to address those questions elsewhere?,325,,
1559,0.97,9403.394,9404.795,It depends on how detailed you get.,326,,
1560,0.97,9404.795,9410.4,"I use to oversee Arcing enforcement, but it was a few years ago.",326,,
1561,0.97,9410.4,9411.402,I will do my best.,326,,
1562,0.97,9411.402,9412.002,I was that?,326,,
1563,0.97,9412.002,9412.803,"Thank you, Captain.",327,,
1564,0.97,9412.803,9419.576,I have to say that my question pertains to both the data that is retained on the patrol cars and with parking enforcement.,327,,
1565,0.97,9419.576,9440.431,"This was getting to what Councilmember Herbold was saying, if there is not a hit on the license plate that you retain the data for, I heard you share that it is helpful to retain the data to identify stolen cars that maybe you did not know were stolen at that moment.",327,,
1566,0.97,9440.431,9443.734,And you later realized were stolen.,327,,
1567,0.97,9443.734,9447.604,Are there other reasons to do this?,327,,
1568,0.97,9447.604,9453.11,It does seem to me on its face that we are retaining far too much data that is a personal nature.,327,,
1569,0.97,9453.11,9473.263,"So in response to obviously earlier inquiries over the years, SPD has reduced the attention time--retention time, 180 days, which is what state law allows, we reduced to 90 days to make sure that a significant image has not been recovered.",328,,
1570,0.97,9473.263,9477.034,"The definition of a significant image is very, very broad.",328,,
1571,0.97,9477.034,9486.477,"And then on top of that we have to make sure that we can answer public disclosure requests, which take quite a bit of time considering the sheer volume of public disclosure requests that we get.",328,,
1572,0.97,9486.477,9503.694,"So in terms of that and trying to balance it all out, we said look, though one Homicide case I am aware of, it came in about two and half weeks after the Homicide because it took the detective in another jurisdiction that long to feel out the vehicle.",328,,
1573,0.97,9503.694,9513.203,We were able to locate the vehicle and then subsequently affect the rest.,328,,
1574,0.97,9513.203,9515.305,So it gives us a buffer to do that.,328,,
1575,0.97,9515.305,9520.31,"But after 90 days, if the case or the license plate has not been flagged to a specific case, it is called linked in the I.T.",328,,
1576,0.97,9520.31,9527.117,"World and has not been linked to a case or pulled, it is automatically deleted at 90 days.",328,,
1577,0.97,9527.117,9532.222,The officers have no touch with that and cannot try to keep it longer or anything like that.,328,,
1578,0.97,9532.222,9533.023,"Thank you, Captain.",329,,
1579,0.97,9533.023,9541.932,"It would be helpful for me to receive the data from your end, to better understand the need to retain the data that long.",329,,
1580,0.97,9541.932,9562.152,"You know, I hear your concern about public disclosure requests and I would also be interested to hear from the law Department about the difference between if you were to only retain the license plate for say three hours, with that be considered a transitory piece of data?",329,,
1581,0.97,9562.152,9570.761,"You know, if you take a note, to remind yourself to make a phone call later this afternoon, you don't have to save it for public disclosure.",329,,
1582,0.97,9570.761,9578.368,"But if you leave the note in your notebook, once the public disclosure was put in and requested, then you would have to share it.",329,,
1583,0.97,9578.368,9583.674,"The difference between transitory and all those in favor, say ""aye.""",329,,
1584,0.97,9583.674,9584.875,I would defer to legal.,330,,
1585,0.97,9584.875,9591.582,But there are issues to not keeping the data.,330,,
1586,0.97,9591.582,9600.223,I will let legal be clear on that.,330,,
1587,0.97,9600.223,9606.096,"But in terms of seeing the data, you can break away or come over and we can show you but you have to Login and follow the steps.",330,,
1588,0.97,9606.096,9610.601,"I don't believe, I would have to defer to legal, that I can pull a copy of it and just handed off.",330,,
1589,0.97,9610.601,9611.101,Absolutely.,331,,
1590,0.97,9611.101,9611.468,Thank you.,331,,
1591,0.97,9611.468,9621.912,"And then to focus my question or intently, is to say, I just need high-level information.",331,,
1592,0.97,9621.912,9624.114,"Is retaining the data, has it produced 100 more arrests?",331,,
1593,0.97,9624.114,9625.716,What were the arrests for?,331,,
1594,0.97,9625.716,9630.287,Did it cover seven cars or 24 cars?,331,,
1595,0.97,9630.287,9652.009,"When we are making these types of policy decisions, to simply say that retaining this data for 180 days, or 90 days, is a benefit because we made one recovery, or three recoveries of cars, is far different than 100 recoveries.",331,,
1596,0.97,9652.009,9659.75,That is the policy perspective that I am coming with to this conversation.,331,,
1597,0.97,9659.75,9660.951,Thank you.,331,,
1598,0.97,9660.951,9665.555,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,332,,
1599,0.97,9665.555,9670.06,Any other questions for the the team that we have?,332,,
1600,0.97,9670.06,9671.728,"Lease Department, I.T., central staff.",332,,
1601,0.97,9671.728,9677.167,Otherwise we can close out and then talk briefly about next steps.,332,,
1602,0.97,9677.167,9678.168,All right.,332,,
1603,0.97,9678.168,9681.938,"Chair Pedersen, if I can.",333,,
1604,0.97,9681.938,9683.974,Thank you so much.,333,,
1605,0.97,9683.974,9715.005,"I don't necessarily have questions, thank you captain Paul Mcdonagh for being with us today, to provide initial responses here . I just want to signal to both the chair and Councilmembers, that I will continue to spend the time between now and the chair's new deadline of next Tuesday, to highlight any additional concerns that I might have related to these particular Technologies.",333,,
1606,0.97,9715.005,9715.672,And my H.O.P.E.,333,,
1607,0.97,9715.672,9718.875,Is that we will be able to do that consistent with the deadline here.,333,,
1608,0.97,9718.875,9723.413,"I certainly don't want to be the, what is the phrase?",333,,
1609,0.97,9723.413,9726.483,Fly in the ointment and get us all stuck here on this.,333,,
1610,0.97,9726.483,9729.92,I know that we have a lot of other Technologies that we need to consider here.,333,,
1611,0.97,9729.92,9737.027,We will work expeditiously to identify any concerns and we will make sure to reach out to I.T.,333,,
1612,0.97,9737.027,9740.597,And captain Paul Mcdonagh with questions.,333,,
1613,0.97,9740.597,9742.632,And of course with the assistance of lise Kaye.,333,,
1614,0.97,9742.632,9746.937,Thank you so much.,333,,
1615,0.97,9746.937,9748.004,Thank you Council President.,334,,
1616,0.97,9748.004,9772.763,"That sums it up well for everybody, colleagues, to get your amendments, potential amendments and talk through them with lise Kaye and then as you craft them, we can get them over to the city attorney's office for the additional review and the additional lens of Mike this affect the dissent decree.",334,,
1617,0.97,9772.763,9776.867,"And we can get them published and we can talk about them at the next meeting on Wednesday, April 7th.",334,,
1618,0.97,9776.867,9786.543,"And again, look for the introduction referral, you may see the bill broken into pieces so we can be more nimble on the Seventh.",334,,
1619,0.97,9786.543,9792.115,And are there any final comments?,334,,
1620,0.97,9792.115,9794.084,For the good of the order we can close out.,334,,
1621,0.97,9794.084,9799.389,"For me, I want to thank everyone who has been working on their surveillance impact reports for many many months.",334,,
1622,0.97,9799.389,9806.096,"And there is a long process as we discussed earlier, and lots of input.",334,,
1623,0.97,9806.096,9811.601,"And we have got one of the chief architects of that process here, Council President Gonzalez as well.",334,,
1624,0.97,9811.601,9823.313,We are seeing the benefits of it by raising the issues and we note that some of the departments made positive changes to their policies during the Sir process.,334,,
1625,0.97,9823.313,9828.618,That is a really good outcome already for some of this.,334,,
