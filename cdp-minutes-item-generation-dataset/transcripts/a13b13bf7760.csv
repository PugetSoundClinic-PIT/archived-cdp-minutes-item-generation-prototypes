473,0.97,2563.26,2570.901,Once again our accountability system provided illusion of an official response with no real consequences for abusive policing.,64,,
474,0.97,2570.901,2574.872,The Oig is the wrong entity to review police behavior.,64,,
475,0.97,2574.872,2580.244,It is not independent of the SPD like the OPA.,64,,

500,0.97,2720.15,2734.631,It's important to remember people are responsible for their own traces and there ought to be a recognized personal accountability.,69,,
501,0.97,2734.631,2737.935,This is Council to recognize this principal.,69,,
502,0.97,2737.935,2747.344,It's foolish and dangerous to place a number on . It seem this is proposal and recent cuts to SPD are exact opposite of that.,69,,
503,0.97,2747.344,2749.88,Again this needs to be a public safety issue.,69,,

711,0.97,4079.275,4083.779,I don't see additional questions.,97,,
712,0.97,4083.779,4086.882,Anything to add to that colleagues?,97,,

715,0.97,4096.225,4097.159,Let's move on.,97,,
716,0.97,4097.159,4111.607,"Item 5 is Sdot 5A 1. before I go into this, I wanted to highlight I have additional information that came after this proposal was published for the agenda.",98,,
717,0.97,4111.607,4112.241,Please bare with me.,98,,
718,0.97,4112.241,4118.881,This would add 1.8 million for the Georgetown South Park trail.,98,,
719,0.97,4118.881,4127.389,The 1.8 million was originally identified by council as a future funding need that was not funded when the project was first identified.,98,,
720,0.97,4127.389,4139.335,Essentially the Council approved design money and put a place holder in the future budget years to identify the construction money would be needed for this project.,98,,
721,0.97,4139.335,4143.139,The project is currently fully funded through design.,98,,
722,0.97,4143.139,4144.273,We have a revised process.,98,,
723,0.97,4144.273,4152.915,We now know the cost estimate for this project is $6.8 million.,98,,
724,0.97,4152.915,4158.954,The department identified $1.6 million potential grant for this project.,98,,
725,0.97,4158.954,4161.056,It leaves an unfunded construction amount $5.2 million.,98,,
726,0.97,4161.056,4165.327,That's new information not included in the write up.,98,,
727,0.97,4165.327,4166.862,I apologize for that.,98,,
728,0.97,4166.862,4167.329,It's new information.,98,,
729,0.97,4167.329,4178.107,This proposal is sponsored by Council member Morales and has Cosponsorship from Herbold and Councilmember Sawant.,98,,
730,0.97,4178.107,4179.575,Thank you.,99,,
731,0.97,4179.575,4181.877,Please go ahead.,99,,

734,0.97,4200.996,4205.568,I am--I appreciate the new information Calvin.,99,,
735,0.97,4205.568,4236.832,"We have been trying to get more clarity on whether the design phase was fully funded and completed or I will say if what we are now understanding is there's a $5 million construction balance that we need to work on, I might ask chair if we can dig into this a little more and try to get a better understanding of what we need to do.",99,,
736,0.97,4236.832,4240.603,It was prepared to ask my colleagues to support the 1.8.,99,,
737,0.97,4240.603,4259.321,I still think this is a really important project for the community.,99,,
738,0.97,4259.321,4270.966,For over 20 years the community has been asking for a connection between South park and Georgetown to connect communities on opposite sides of the river.,99,,
739,0.97,4270.966,4290.786,"I do think this would provide a really important economic development connection between the business corridors in both neighborhoods, provide a really much safer and Family-Friendly way for neighbors in both communities to walk and bike across the route.",99,,
740,0.97,4290.786,4303.198,And would really just unite the valley by connecting to schools and medical facilities and public library.,99,,
741,0.97,4303.198,4321.383,I think this is a really important project I would ask for the chair's indulgence for us to have another conversation about what resources there might be available to fund that 5 million.,99,,
742,0.97,4321.383,4322.318,Thank you.,100,,
743,0.97,4322.318,4323.585,Councilmember Herbold comment?,100,,

746,0.97,4331.56,4338.067,This is a high priority item for Georgetown and you South park.,100,,
747,0.97,4338.067,4359.722,"I appreciate that Reconnect West Seattle has agreed to provide funding to committee the 90% design for this project and recognize that they are Prioritizing this project among many, many Reconnect West Seattle priorities.",100,,
748,0.97,4359.722,4372.534,I'm not sure if the funding gap that Calvin mentioned does mention the grant.,100,,
749,0.97,4372.534,4379.174,The other question I had and perhaps was answered in share point and I missed it.,100,,
750,0.97,4379.174,4392.454,Calvin s can you remind us of the action the Council took last year in the context of Prioritizing bike master plan projects?,100,,
751,0.97,4392.454,4400.395,"This was one of the highly Prioritized plans sorry, one of the highly Prioritized projects from the master plan.",100,,
752,0.97,4400.395,4414.143,We I think passed a resolution during budget last year identifying a half dozen projects as things we felt strongly the pry your tis need to be focused on.,100,,
753,0.97,4414.143,4417.479,What was the outcome?,100,,
754,0.97,4417.479,4420.883,What was the action and outcome of the action?,100,,
755,0.97,4420.883,4424.787,I believe it was in the 2019 budget.,100,,
756,0.97,4424.787,4441.036,There was money identified from the mega block sale transportation funding related to the area used for transportation purposes that was highlighted for additional work on some of these bike facilities.,100,,
757,0.97,4441.036,4445.541,A lot was directed to kind of further that design and concepts.,100,,
758,0.97,4445.541,4450.779,"A lot of focus on the Mlk route, South downtown to Georgetown routes.",100,,
759,0.97,4450.779,4467.329,I believe that was the same time this project was identified as a new--it had been advocated.,100,,
760,0.97,4467.329,4474.169,Not really knowing what the cost estimate was at.,100,,
761,0.97,4474.169,4491.52,I think this item and also the item 7 we'll come to in a moment are follow on from some of that work.,100,,
762,0.97,4491.52,4499.761,Thank you so much.,100,,
763,0.97,4499.761,4506.001,I was going to reference the illustration.,100,,

765,0.97,4506.835,4517.212,Calvin described it in the way it was a list without specific funding identified.,100,,
766,0.97,4517.212,4519.314,It wasn't a Prioritized list.,100,,

774,0.97,4575.671,4592.621,It would restore for five sidewalk segments and the Rainier Valley it is sponsor by Councilmember Morales with cosponsor by Lewis and Sawant.,100,,

779,0.97,4631.026,4633.628,I'm hoping to restore funding as Calvin mentioned.,101,,
780,0.97,4633.628,4640.636,It's for different segments of sidewalk along the road.,101,,
781,0.97,4640.636,4670.332,"We have strong support from the member organizations including transit riders unions, Seattle Greenways, 350 Seattle, bicycle Club and others who understand that being able to get through our neighborhoods safely is really important particularly because we have so many elderly and a lot of folks that have mobility Impairments that need to get down that road safely.",101,,
782,0.97,4670.332,4681.076,I am seeking support to restore funding for these improvements.,101,,

785,0.97,4683.378,4698.093,"On the five sidewalk corridors listed on the back of the form, is there a corresponding data that identifies which areas are the biggest hazard or risk right now?",101,,
786,0.97,4698.093,4704.766,I can follow up with the Department to see if there's a rating on these.,101,,

800,0.97,4771.366,4779.508,We're hoping it can be distributed to complete the Mlk planning study that did start this year.,106,,
801,0.97,4779.508,4784.846,Funding for the Georgetown to downtown via Sotto study which has not begun.,106,,
802,0.97,4784.846,4786.715,We're hoping to get that started.,106,,
803,0.97,4786.715,4796.057,Also to advance design from the Georgetown to downtown Sotto trail.,106,,
804,0.97,4796.057,4798.226,At least to goat 60%.,106,,
805,0.97,4798.226,4802.697,A lot of projects need design time before they're ready for construction.,106,,
806,0.97,4802.697,4811.139,We're trying to get the ball rolling finishing on Mlk in particular keeps that alive about a safe bike route through the Rainier valley.,106,,
807,0.97,4811.139,4820.048,This is one of the parts of town where we don't have any safe bike path to get into the downtown area.,106,,
808,0.97,4820.048,4824.553,There are lots of different studies that are being proposed.,106,,
809,0.97,4824.553,4829.124,I'd like to figure thousand do this well and safely.,106,,
810,0.97,4829.124,4842.204,Both of these connection long with the beacon Avenue trail which was funded through the Mercer block proceeds could really help highlight the missing gaps that we have in the bike network in the Rainier valley.,106,,
811,0.97,4842.204,4870.165,So we want to make sure we're retaining funding for the planning and design of these two routes along with the work that's happening on beacon Hill and honor the community input and time neighbors put in to identifying these priorities and to make sure we are keeping the promises that we made through the bike master plan improvements programs.,106,,
812,0.97,4870.165,4870.565,Thank you.,107,,
813,0.97,4870.565,4871.6,Are there any questions?,107,,
814,0.97,4871.6,4874.202,I do have a question similar to the one I was asking earlier.,107,,
815,0.97,4874.202,4883.845,Do we have a since where this fits in with the various priority documents s Isdot produced already?,107,,
816,0.97,4883.845,4885.881,They were need the bike master plan.,107,,
817,0.97,4885.881,4895.724,I can follow up where they fit on the priority list.,107,,

819,0.97,4905.634,4907.736,Thank you very much.,108,,
820,0.97,4907.736,4918.046,Let's keep going.,108,,
821,0.97,4918.48,4927.322,This is an increase from the city auditor's 2020 bridge maintenance report.,108,,
822,0.97,4927.322,4938.133,"It's sponsor by Councilmember Pederson, Herbold and Lewis.",108,,
823,0.97,4938.133,4950.879,"Councilmembers Lewis and Herbold, thank you to laborers for calling and writing to us and Sotto small business area writing to us for need to repair our bridges.",108,,
824,0.97,4950.879,4963.558,"The recent audit of bridge across Seattle connected with our city auditor, they concluded that our city government has been substantially Underinvesting in the maintenance of bridges throughout the city.",108,,
825,0.97,4963.558,4969.631,The result of Underfunding our bridge infrastructure increases the risk of harm and disruption.,108,,
826,0.97,4969.631,4978.94,"Failing to invest in adequate levels today means taxpayers may bare larger replacement costs later, pay now or pay more later.",108,,
827,0.97,4978.94,4986.281,"The West Seattle bridge will be a wake up call to take care of infrastructure, keep our residents and local economy moving.",108,,
828,0.97,4986.281,5008.97,I appreciate the Mayor's budget tried to keep level the amount of spending for bridge maintenance despite the budget deficits would increase Sdot's gown provide the bare minimum of maintenance funding as recommended by the audit of all bridges by our city auditor.,108,,
829,0.97,5008.97,5009.704,Happy to answer question.,108,,
830,0.97,5009.704,5011.906,"Councilmember Herbold, go ahead.",109,,
831,0.97,5011.906,5014.275,Thank you so much.,110,,
832,0.97,5014.275,5040.668,Really appreciate it and really appreciate Councilmember Pederson bringing this forward and leadership asking for the bridge awe difficult just a little bit of behind the scenes on the deliberations around the future path to address the West Seattle bridge closure for folks who aren't paying super close attention.,110,,
833,0.97,5040.668,5062.757,You know the city is seriously considering not moving forward with the repair despite the fact is that it's cost is modest.,110,,
834,0.97,5062.757,5067.362,There's a high confidence from the panel that a repair would last.,110,,
835,0.97,5067.362,5092.887,"One of the reasons, one of the biggest reasons why the city is leaning towards replacement at a higher cost, Upfront purchase cost is because they're not confident that we will fund the annual maintenance of the existing bridge.",110,,
836,0.97,5092.887,5110.605,A new bridge would cost $250 million annually to maintain $5 million yearly to maintain.,110,,
837,0.97,5110.605,5128.523,I'm finding it difficult to justify the expenditure when we have finite transportation dollars to meet a lot of needs.,110,,
838,0.97,5128.523,5139.701,The building of a brand new bridge because we're afraid we're going to continue Dysfunctional practices about maintaining our current infrastructure.,110,,
839,0.97,5139.701,5155.483,I hope we find a way to follow the city auditor's recommendations as it relates to we can better maintain existing bridges.,110,,
840,0.97,5155.483,5166.928,Our bridges are surveying more and more commuters using transit.,110,,
841,0.97,5166.928,5169.664,And many bridges have transit only lanes.,110,,
842,0.97,5169.664,5178.806,There are Multimodal and serve freight corridors that are so important to our small businesses.,110,,
843,0.97,5178.806,5180.875,Really feeling that in West Seattle.,110,,
844,0.97,5180.875,5189.784,Small impacts from small businesses not having the bridge running.,110,,
845,0.97,5189.784,5201.729,I really hope that everybody take this is seriously and we work together to find the recommendations of the city auditor.,110,,
846,0.97,5201.729,5202.564,Thank you.,110,,
847,0.97,5202.564,5206.234,Councilmember Sawant go ahead.,111,,
848,0.97,5206.234,5206.568,Thank you.,112,,
849,0.97,5206.568,5221.649,"I'm happy to cosponsor this, but I think it's important to also note that and the Department of transportation's budget has been cut by Mayor Durkan $117 million.",112,,
850,0.97,5221.649,5228.089,This is a sort of necessary maintenance which is an example of what is being cut.,112,,
851,0.97,5228.089,5249.077,"While I'm happy to cosponsor this, I proposed a budget amendment to restore all this on $17 million worth of cuts by increasing is the taxes on big businesses that the council passed earlier this year.",112,,
852,0.97,5249.077,5253.414,Thank you very much.,113,,
853,0.97,5253.414,5255.083,I do have a few questions.,113,,
854,0.97,5255.083,5255.55,Councilmember Calvin.,113,,
855,0.97,5255.55,5261.289,You have four a at Thes insist the maintenance proposal here.,113,,
856,0.97,5261.289,5268.863,Three items with a $4 million price tag and one with a $12 million price tag?,113,,
857,0.97,5268.863,5272.0,Are those sequential or stand alone items?,113,,
858,0.97,5272.0,5272.634,Did you understand my question?,113,,
859,0.97,5272.634,5291.185,"Yes, those are--so the way we allocate the 24 million, the idea is get up to the $34 million figure, the bare minimum recommended by the auditor.",113,,
860,0.97,5291.185,5298.426,The auditor said $102 million.,113,,
861,0.97,5298.426,5300.094,We're spend $3 million now.,113,,
862,0.97,5300.094,5304.332,The three items were identified as the core bridge maintenance items.,113,,
863,0.97,5304.332,5317.311,"We would be agent proportional to the existing budget for those line items, taking the 24 million and applying proportionally to those line items.",113,,
864,0.97,5317.311,5322.717,So it's a proportional increase on items already there.,114,,
865,0.97,5322.717,5331.926,Your proposal--I'm asking would it be feasible if you identified one or two of those four items.,114,,
866,0.97,5331.926,5343.671,"It sounds like the answer is no, it needs to be proportional increase.",114,,
867,0.97,5343.671,5344.539,"Yes, exactly.",115,,
868,0.97,5344.539,5346.908,You mentioned proposed revenue sources.,115,,

870,0.97,5364.859,5366.761,We can chat about it.,115,,
871,0.97,5366.761,5388.75,The question is really about how do we try to identify the needed revenue sources to fill this relatively large budget item and recognizing that we need the executive to be willing to Implenty possible revenue sources as important as well.,115,,

879,0.97,5417.412,5420.681,It's going to be a major consideration.,117,,
880,0.97,5420.681,5421.682,"Say that again, Calvin.",118,,
881,0.97,5421.682,5435.997,"Unlike other proposals we've talked about, one time ads for 2021, this is an annual increase in bridge maintenance to meet the commitment or need identified in the auditor's report.",119,,

891,0.97,5477.638,5499.093,"It identifies forming categories of reporting one on the West Seattle bridge, one on the lower Spokane swing bridge one on maintenance of other bridges in the corridor and one on the West seat million program which is the traffic mitigation and response program that's associated with the project.",121,,

895,0.97,5511.672,5525.453,The intent is continue the weekly reporting that the Council has been receiving from Sdot on the West Seattle bridge and the Reconnect West Seattle investments.,122,,
896,0.97,5525.453,5533.394,This is a reasonable request given that the budget proposes a bond sale of $100 million to fund activities.,122,,
897,0.97,5533.394,5541.135,This is adding 30 million in addition to the inner fund loan of 70 million already approved by the Council.,122,,

923,0.97,5659.62,5663.057,That's the end of the s Isdot category.,126,,
924,0.97,5663.057,5669.43,Are there additional questions or anybody didn't get the chance to add their names to any Sdot items?,127,,
925,0.97,5669.43,5671.465,"Thank you very much, Calvin.",127,,
926,0.97,5671.465,5673.034,Good to see you.,127,,
927,0.97,5673.034,5692.286,"Before we jump in, Jeff, I might offer to my colleagues the next four items in the homelessness section when we did our form a walk Throughs, these are four items when I suggested that it sounded like a lot of Commonality, perhaps energy between what we were asking for.",127,,
928,0.97,5692.286,5712.173,"I don't see them here listed as a one form B. as we walk through these first four forms, I would like to continue to think about the communities to Firemennal Commonalities of these.",127,,
929,0.97,5712.173,5720.047,If you're connecting the tissue between the two.,127,,
930,0.97,5720.047,5721.449,That would be helpful.,127,,
931,0.97,5721.449,5729.19,"Just again, seemingly my interests seeking these woven together in some way satisfying of the projective of the proposal.",127,,
932,0.97,5729.19,5736.697,Let's turn over to Jeff to walk us through the homelessness in the session.,127,,
933,0.97,5736.697,5737.965,You're exactly correct.,128,,
934,0.97,5737.965,5746.941,"On items 10, 11, 12, 13 on the agenda, actually I put all sponsor offices, also Emailed me as we committed these.",128,,
935,0.97,5746.941,5754.315,It was a more function of time in order to work out specifics how to merge these all together.,128,,
936,0.97,5754.315,5770.931,The sentiment from all the offices was they wanted to work to find a way to roll each of these together given the amount of Overlapse and come out with a crisp proposal that would be one single item each run through homelessness outreach.,128,,
937,0.97,5770.931,5774.335,"They're in a general range of 100,000 or 200,000.",128,,
938,0.97,5774.335,5777.938,Some have unique is specifics to them.,128,,
939,0.97,5777.938,5789.183,I'll start off with 1 and the factor here is focus on the behavioral health about of the providers to provide health services.,128,,
940,0.97,5789.183,5791.152,There's a geographic purpose to each of these.,128,,
941,0.97,5791.152,5794.421,"In this, issue one is West seat and will South park.",128,,
942,0.97,5794.421,5809.837,There's also a strong description as you can see in the format provided related to the way the this team would enact with numbers both community and people experiencing unsheltered homelessness and businesses in the area.,128,,
943,0.97,5809.837,5826.72,The sponsor for H 1 is Council Memberher Council member Councilmember Herbode.,128,,
944,0.97,5826.72,5830.057,Thank you so her bold.,129,,
945,0.97,5830.057,5831.392,Thank you.,130,,
946,0.97,5831.392,5844.505,I think there's a lot of potential to combine my proposed budget action with those of other Council members.,130,,
947,0.97,5844.505,5858.252,The important thing to focus on is there's a strong interest to have geographically focused neighborhood focused outreach services.,130,,
948,0.97,5858.252,5872.7,I think the call for these services is really a Testament to how much our neighborhoods and communities are understanding the importance of outreach as a critical skill set and service right now.,130,,
949,0.97,5872.7,5874.468,Outreach is a compassionate response.,130,,
950,0.97,5874.468,5877.738,People are trying to survive without a roof over their heads.,130,,
951,0.97,5877.738,5884.478,It's also a practical response as new neighbors are struggling to find ways to live side by side.,130,,
952,0.97,5884.478,5891.552,Of course outreach is not a replacement for sufficient Noncongregate shelter space and affordable housing.,130,,
953,0.97,5891.552,5905.299,It's vital we continue to invest in Scaling up resources as well so that folks living unsheltered have a safety and healthy alternative to living outside.,130,,
954,0.97,5905.299,5929.223,"Outreach as we know can detect other needed services such as lead or health care identify the need for city service such as garbage removal, is health encampment services and provide information to encampment neighbors there a great need for this skill set in South seat and will South park.",130,,
955,0.97,5929.223,5936.33,We're seeing the increase of people living unsheltered due to the pandemic and economic downturn.,130,,
956,0.97,5936.33,5946.34,"Because of the strains on mobility due to the West seat bridge being out of Commission, it's hard for workers not Stayinged in district 1 to make it here regularly.",130,,
957,0.97,5946.34,5953.247,I appreciate the work they've been doing to be present in district 1 at least once a week.,130,,
958,0.97,5953.247,5984.878,"I want to signal that if we were able to work together to combine the proposals that various Council members have for geographic neighborhood based outreach, I would say that to be a really critical part of the proposal that we'll hear later from Councilmember Morales on the is hope proposal.",130,,
959,0.97,5984.878,5986.313,I don't want to call it a team.,130,,
960,0.97,5986.313,5991.385,We're trying to move away from calling it a team.,130,,
961,0.97,5991.385,5996.523,That is the new approach to replace the navigation team.,130,,
962,0.97,5996.523,6011.438,The thing that's really missing from that is the funding for outreach and flexible services that we just passed on Monday when we lifted the provider on the navigation team.,130,,
963,0.97,6011.438,6037.998,"We lifted the provider on the old navigation team, funded a person, Hsd staffing that does not do engagement on the street but funds Robustly outreach from our outreach partners who have been negotiating with the executive about this approach.",130,,
964,0.97,6037.998,6046.34,We don't have that compliment for 2021 in the budget that we just passed for the remainder of 2020.,130,,
965,0.97,6046.34,6091.485,"I would that when we look at perhaps doing this city wide but still within neighborhood geographic focus for outreach that we Replicate the approach we used in the budget provider we just lifted and make clear that funding outreach also includes funding case management, en funding access to housing navigators, funding the services of the diversion services that work so well when outreach providers have is access to them and flexible financial services.",130,,
966,0.97,6091.485,6091.819,Thank you.,130,,
967,0.97,6091.819,6097.558,Thank you very much Council member Herbold.,130,,
968,0.97,6097.558,6099.193,Any questions on that?,130,,
969,0.97,6099.193,6102.095,No questions on that.,130,,
970,0.97,6102.095,6113.207,"Appreciate you flagging how this could potentially, these geographic efforts could tie into a broader Reframe on how we do outreach and housing and shelter placement.",130,,
971,0.97,6113.207,6123.817,We'll look forward to hearing more as we continue to diverse that today and also hear back from providers.,130,,
972,0.97,6123.817,6130.824,Thank you for flagging that opportunity there.,130,,
973,0.97,6130.824,6131.358,Makes me hopeful.,130,,
974,0.97,6131.358,6131.925,I'll stop.,130,,
975,0.97,6131.925,6137.364,I don't see additional questions.,130,,
976,0.97,6137.364,6149.643,We have decisional Council members . Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,130,,
977,0.97,6149.643,6165.559,Next item up is HON 2A 1. this is by Councilmember Morales.,130,,
978,0.97,6165.993,6167.227,"This would provide $98,000.",130,,
979,0.97,6167.227,6170.964,"In this case, the target is Columbia city and Rainier Beach.",130,,
980,0.97,6170.964,6193.353,Another unique aspect compared to other three is utilizing agency that represents individuals that have experienced homelessness and as the agency provides if services.,130,,
981,0.97,6193.353,6196.089,"Councilmember Morales, go ahead.",131,,
982,0.97,6196.089,6196.49,Thank you.,132,,
983,0.97,6196.49,6206.5,So this is an the attempt again.,132,,
984,0.97,6206.5,6243.337,"This would add work tore Rainier Valley to promote engagements in district 2. we recently had the opportunity to visit with several Encampments going along side outreach workers and so we've been able to see fist hand the really important work that they do through this sort of engagement beyond the outreach itself, offering clothing and help connect to services and helping connect them to shelter.",132,,
985,0.97,6243.337,6253.447,Just having these outreach workers there to be present and to be a resource is to folks has been important.,132,,
986,0.97,6253.447,6258.518,We know this is deeply appreciated.,132,,
987,0.97,6258.518,6261.622,"So as the chair mentioned earlier, we have had conversations.",132,,
988,0.97,6261.622,6266.76,There's been a staff level conversation about rolling these up to one proposal.,132,,
989,0.97,6266.76,6270.731,Happy to think about that and think about something larger.,132,,
990,0.97,6270.731,6279.573,I want to say we've had conversations during this budget process that right through call out outreach adds only one piece of a greater Ecosystem.,132,,
991,0.97,6279.573,6287.381,That's what we're trying to do as we'll discuss later with the hope proposal.,132,,
992,0.97,6287.381,6291.051,This really is about creating a broader Ecosystem.,132,,
993,0.97,6291.051,6293.353,It isn't just outreach we're talking about.,132,,
994,0.97,6293.353,6302.396,"We want to acknowledge there's a need to build more permanent supportive housing, more low and no barrier shelter.",132,,
995,0.97,6302.396,6315.409,Our hope is we start to move forwards having a deep conversation with investments as well.,132,,
996,0.97,6315.409,6318.879,"That said, engagement outreach mean a lot to 00 folks living outside.",132,,
997,0.97,6318.879,6325.419,We're happy to bring this budget action to support the outreach work being done.,132,,
998,0.97,6325.419,6328.488,Thank you Councilmember.,133,,
999,0.97,6328.488,6329.99,Any questions on this item?,133,,
1000,0.97,6329.99,6330.19,Okay.,133,,
1001,0.97,6330.19,6331.992,You specifically mentioned reach.,133,,
1002,0.97,6331.992,6344.738,I wanted to note that the proposal you're bringing forward really identifies reach as a core service provider in partnership with Bipoc organization.,133,,
1003,0.97,6344.738,6347.808,We know there's Bipoc members strong members and leaders in reach.,133,,
1004,0.97,6347.808,6356.85,I wanted to be sure because reach has gotten a lot of support and evidence behind it.,133,,
1005,0.97,6356.85,6357.818,Wanted to hear more about that.,133,,
1006,0.97,6357.818,6358.452,Sure.,134,,
1007,0.97,6358.452,6382.042,"So we've--throughout these conversations, we've been talking for example the Seattle health board with chief Seattle Club and we want to make sure that as we move forward that we are finding folks and supporting organizations that have more direct contact, reaches one organization.",134,,
1008,0.97,6382.042,6401.728,There are others that are engaged in this work as well.,134,,

1014,0.97,6447.107,6452.546,I'm glad you characterized Madame chair what we're dealing with here.,135,,
1015,0.97,6452.546,6469.162,"I think it's no coincidence that items 10, 11, 12 s 13 correspond with district 1, District 2, District 5, District 6. we are feeling the effects of the removal of the navigation team.",135,,
1016,0.97,6469.162,6475.335,"Whatever the politics are, the need is still there.",135,,
1017,0.97,6475.335,6476.837,It's a gaping need.,135,,
1018,0.97,6476.837,6480.273,We're finding more and more.,135,,
1019,0.97,6480.273,6487.581,We've been laser focused on community outreach.,135,,
1020,0.97,6487.581,6491.785,I wanted to just add going through advocacy here.,135,,
1021,0.97,6491.785,6497.991,I want to comment we want this to be community based.,135,,
1022,0.97,6497.991,6510.27,"We'll have the resources, family, on a transit spine, that use our community center, our library, food banks, our clinic, where they get their health care.",135,,
1023,0.97,6510.27,6511.938,A lot of folks actually live here.,135,,
1024,0.97,6511.938,6527.454,So that is why I'm putting the focus on putting people from the community so you're not deploying Hsd from the South end up North that aren't familiar with the community.,135,,
1025,0.97,6527.454,6546.606,"Best successes we have had in getting people into housing, the tiny how has village is because folks in the Commons, health line, Meninit E community, Lake City all know these folks.",135,,
1026,0.97,6546.606,6553.313,"We feed them twice a week at North Seattle library, Lake City library, BROADVIEW library.",135,,

1055,0.97,6772.966,6774.801,I haven't listed all the parks.,135,,
1056,0.97,6774.801,6782.208,I've given you the top three that have quadrupled in size since July.,135,,
1057,0.97,6782.208,6783.376,"So, there is a need.",135,,

1059,0.97,6784.577,6791.751,I have no problem working with the other district representatives in maybe bundling this up together.,135,,
1060,0.97,6791.751,6792.986,I want to caution one thing.,135,,
1061,0.97,6792.986,6804.898,"It's really important that we use the people that are already on the ground who live here who work here, who have businesses here who are already doing the work.",135,,
1062,0.97,6804.898,6805.798,So that is my only caution.,135,,

1066,0.97,6819.379,6829.389,I want to add a pieces as well.,135,,
1067,0.97,6829.389,6842.936,"We know that from public testimony and from Oring with folks on the ground, those trusted community partners it's been really challenging because people are aware that Covid is spreading in indoor areas.",135,,
1068,0.97,6842.936,6849.943,Nationally I think we've seen more visible presence of folks who are living outside and unsheltered.,135,,
1069,0.97,6849.943,6871.331,"That helps underscore your point we need trusted community partner on the ground that have relationships that know the neighborhood, know folks in the community and how to approach people in a more trustworthy way to make sure they're not only building a relationship but a Noncongregate shelter setting.",135,,
1070,0.97,6871.331,6884.577,They're able to help them get in quickly.,135,,
1071,0.97,6887.347,6890.25,"In June and July, we saw more presence.",135,,
1072,0.97,6890.25,6892.252,All of you are recognizing that.,135,,
1073,0.97,6892.252,6897.59,This was well before the navigation team discussion that didn't go in effect until October 22nd.,135,,
1074,0.97,6897.59,6925.718,"I think both at national level seeing this trend, everything you all as Councilmembers are experiencing in districts are really underscoring the need for us to not possible get more money out the door for this outreach effort but as you and previous Counselmember spoke about the need to make sure it's not just outreach that you're getting folks inside getting inside in the middle of a deadly pandemic requires the Noncongregate shelter setting.",135,,
1075,0.97,6925.718,6933.092,I think these are all issues Úthat are absolute Isly heard for the need to make sure we're working with those on the ground level.,135,,
1076,0.97,6933.092,6947.84,This is definitely something we've seen over the last four or five months and not just the last two to three weeks.,135,,
1077,0.97,6947.84,6949.842,Additional comments or questions?,135,,
1078,0.97,6949.842,6952.145,Councilmember Sawant?,135,,
1079,0.97,6952.145,6953.246,Thank you.,136,,
1080,0.97,6953.246,6957.116,I'm already Cosponsoring this amendment as it shows through.,136,,
1081,0.97,6957.116,6960.687,Undoubtedly my office supports the outreach workers and social workers completely.,136,,
1082,0.97,6960.687,6984.777,"In fact, that's why my office is consistently fighting to Defund the police by at least 50% and instead use funds for services that actually work and in addition to proposing to increase the Amazon tax so that we can fund what our communities Kneed which is services and housing and the green new deal.",136,,
1083,0.97,6984.777,6995.154,Unfortunately so far my office is the only office to have put forward proposals let alone fight for it in a meaningful way.,136,,
1084,0.97,6995.154,7001.794,"I want to clarify that in response to comments made, navigation team was never actually removed.",136,,
1085,0.97,7001.794,7005.598,The city council's budget vote never took effect.,136,,
1086,0.97,7005.598,7010.203,"This past Monday, the city council minimized the summer Ordnance even further.",136,,
1087,0.97,7010.203,7015.541,I was a solid no vote on that Ordnance.,136,,
1088,0.97,7015.541,7021.28,Mayor Durkan likes to blame homelessness on the supposed end of the navigation team.,136,,
1089,0.97,7021.28,7023.716,That is not based in facts.,136,,
1090,0.97,7023.716,7043.236,"I would like the add in terms of where funds should come from, not only should the city council be responding to the demand to reduce Seattle police to Defund services, this week, we've got important news.",136,,
1091,0.97,7043.236,7052.378,Three Seattle corporations reported staggering profit this is week Amazon $6.2 billion of profit for the third quarter.,136,,
1092,0.97,7052.378,7053.646,These are quarterly profit reports.,136,,
1093,0.97,7053.646,7057.65,This is a 200% increase over the corporation's last year's properties.,136,,
1094,0.97,7057.65,7072.832,"Since is the pandemic struck early they are year, Amazon owners made record profits of $11.5 billion . Microsoft announced a 30% increase.",136,,
1095,0.97,7072.832,7087.613,I don't think we should be which corporation is going to be taxed in Seattle because the point that I'm trying to make sure is that many corporations have profited during this pandemic.,136,,
1096,0.97,7087.613,7096.155,It's correct the burden of the crisis should not be placed on working people in marginalized communities.,136,,
1097,0.97,7096.155,7103.563,The action at Thats on big business should be increased because they're making higher profits.,136,,
1098,0.97,7103.563,7113.406,"Another corporation in Seattle, Starbucks just reported $400 million profits for the third quarter which delighted financial analysts.",136,,
1099,0.97,7113.406,7114.173,It exceeded their expectations.,136,,
1100,0.97,7114.173,7123.249,These are important facts to take into account and understand the full funding of service will require those progressive measures.,136,,
1101,0.97,7123.249,7136.329,"I also add that I've cosponsored all the proposals from all districts for regional or district based Coordinators, outreach workers.",136,,
1102,0.97,7136.329,7146.606,We certainly want to propose something is similar for Capitol Hill and the District because we're seeing an increased issue of homelessness that is affecting the community here.,136,,
1103,0.97,7146.606,7153.212,I hope that we can make sure that every part of the city has adequate funds.,136,,
1104,0.97,7153.212,7156.549,It's not one region versus another.,136,,
1105,0.97,7156.549,7158.951,I agree with the Councilmember on that.,136,,
1106,0.97,7158.951,7162.355,All the regions of our city need this.,136,,
1107,0.97,7162.355,7164.357,It's our homeless neighbors and constituents that are suffering.,136,,
1108,0.97,7164.357,7170.93,"At the end of the day, all of that leaves the question of how these services are going to be funded.",136,,
1109,0.97,7170.93,7175.301,It leaves that question unanswered.,136,,
1110,0.97,7175.301,7176.068,I think we have answers.,136,,
1111,0.97,7176.068,7178.804,We will need political on the Council.,136,,

1122,0.97,7229.822,7232.191,It would propose that model.,138,,

1133,0.97,7305.598,7314.807,This proposal would also allow some funding to be used for cleaning or security purposes as long as the majority of the funds are used for outreach workers.,140,,
1134,0.97,7314.807,7331.724,"The reason I made this slight change is because we have noticed as bars and restaurants close earlier due to the pandemic, the hours of no one on the streets has extended.",140,,

1182,0.97,7615.941,7628.02,"That means coordinating things like litter picks or purple bag program, collaborating with service providers on best outcomes for folks living Unhoused.",144,,
1183,0.97,7628.02,7647.84,The Ecosystem would try to uplift and align the frame work received this week designed by the executive and providers and would allow for first responders and police to address issues with Encampments if providers are calling for that.,144,,
1184,0.97,7647.84,7652.111,It wouldn't give license for wholesale Eviction of folks.,144,,
1185,0.97,7652.111,7667.326,So this hope program is really meant to become the city's apparatus for a more Holistic approach.,144,,
1186,0.97,7667.326,7672.531,This is one way to communicate with folks on the ground and in the field everyday.,144,,
1187,0.97,7672.531,7679.038,"Those are the people that have relationships, the ones on the streets that know who neighbors are and what they need.",144,,
1188,0.97,7679.038,7683.375,Hope is how we can start to repair the harm caused by the navigation team.,144,,
1189,0.97,7683.375,7695.421,"If you want an example of this approach, what it might look like we received an Email this week from just care, the pilot project that was happening in the Cid.",144,,
1190,0.97,7695.421,7699.892,That really demonstrates how effect they've kind of model can be.,144,,
1191,0.97,7699.892,7711.77,I want to thank Deven on my staff who was the person that facilitated the conversation between just cares and the community members frustrate bid that particular encampment.,144,,
1192,0.97,7711.77,7733.559,"Because of the work he did that our office did to make connections and explain to frustrated community members what this program could be, it really gave the folks who were living in the encampment a little breathing room and they voluntarily moved because of the outreach provided to them.",144,,
1193,0.97,7733.559,7738.597,It really kind of Ratcheted down the tension happening there.,144,,
1194,0.97,7738.597,7740.699,That's what we could be doing.,144,,
1195,0.97,7740.699,7748.44,"So I want to thank reach and Colead, Acrs, chief Seattle Club and Seattle Indian health board.",144,,
1196,0.97,7748.44,7757.449,All of those folks worked really hard to make that happen.,144,,
1197,0.97,7757.449,7758.25,I'm deeply appreciative of that.,144,,
1198,0.97,7758.25,7763.922,This is our chance to move forward and close the book on the navigation team.,144,,
1199,0.97,7763.922,7775.334,I look forward to your support on this proposal.,144,,
1200,0.97,7775.334,7775.634,Thank you.,144,,
1201,0.97,7775.634,7777.269,Thank you very much.,144,,
1202,0.97,7777.269,7782.941,"Councilmember Lewis, go ahead him.",144,,
1203,0.97,7782.941,7786.044,Make a few brief comments.,145,,
1204,0.97,7786.044,7810.135,I removed my name over for sequencing and the parallel progress.,145,,
1205,0.97,7815.14,7822.714,It will ultimately lead to a model like hope that is reflective of the frame work distributed on Monday.,145,,
1206,0.97,7822.714,7855.347,I think one of the unfortunate timing things is that this--our budget process is not necessarily lined up exactly with those conversations which have been fruitful in which the providers have been satisfied with so far in leading to material changes and progress in how the executive has perceived outreach and acknowledgment on what needs to be done to be moving towards this model.,145,,
1207,0.97,7855.347,7870.896,I look forward to continuing to push through 2 project process and hope those two different conversations will be able to merge in the next couple weeks to inform each other.,145,,
1208,0.97,7870.896,7872.03,We do need.,145,,
1209,0.97,7872.03,7879.271,There needs to be legislation of some kind to reflect the new model of outreach.,145,,
1210,0.97,7879.271,7891.75,It is no longer acknowledged by anybody that just putting forward what has been presented in the default proposal from the last month the executive put forward that is going to be the thing we adopt.,145,,
1211,0.97,7891.75,7895.487,There will need to be legislative changes.,145,,
1212,0.97,7895.487,7903.895,It is from the conversations I've had looking like that conversation continues to lean towards a lot of what is manifested in the hope model.,145,,
1213,0.97,7903.895,7936.828,"So, this will be a good conversation over the next two weeks and the rate of those conversations between the executive and providers should be able to catch up to where we are here before we have to set a budget in November.",145,,
1214,0.97,7936.828,7939.398,"Councilmember Herbold, go a.",145,,
1215,0.97,7939.398,7946.705,Between say I appreciate Councilmember Morales proposing this item.,146,,
1216,0.97,7946.705,7954.112,I hope it can build on the conversations ongoing between Council outreach providers and the Mayor's office.,146,,
1217,0.97,7954.112,7986.144,Really appreciate that we all took a step on Monday in approving legislation that marks a real before and after moment when all parties agreed to take the navigation team out of the field instead it built a new approach based on city coordination of encampment management from contracted outreach providers that will be out in the field helping people shelter in place and be good neighbors as well as helping them get into shelter and housing.,146,,
1218,0.97,7986.144,7996.755,"As I noted at the time, that legislation and the accompany frame work that was agreed to by providers and the Mayor sales office marked the beginning of building this new approach.",146,,
1219,0.97,7996.755,8008.967,I see a lot of that frame work reflect in this budget action proposed by cost Morales.,146,,
1220,0.97,8008.967,8010.602,Some is necessary as Lewis just mentioned.,146,,
1221,0.97,8010.602,8021.313,It is necessary to carry the new approach into the 20-21 budget.,146,,
1222,0.97,8021.313,8035.394,"As I've expressed to the sponsor is in the past, I have concerns about the budget action in its current form and appreciate the sponsor's mention of them.",146,,
1223,0.97,8035.394,8050.175,Wondering whether or not we could consider changes changes with the goal of avoiding roadblocks to continuing the work started Monday and ongoing conversation.,146,,
1224,0.97,8050.175,8065.157,I don't want things that we do in this budget cycle to be interpreted by the executive as a reason to end the really productive conversations that they're having.,146,,
1225,0.97,8065.157,8077.102,"Specifically, I'm concerned about the inclusion in this to take the new group of city employees assigned to hope down to five Ftes.",146,,
1226,0.97,8077.102,8085.444,My understanding is the Mayor's office believe they need Ftes and this particular level of staffing was a condition of the new frame work.,146,,
1227,0.97,8085.444,8097.055,So I'm just interested in whether or not the sponsor would be willing to keep the staff level at 8 Ftes.,146,,
1228,0.97,8097.055,8103.328,I'm also concerned about potentially being two prescriptive around the specific role descriptions.,146,,
1229,0.97,8103.328,8117.075,I understand the purpose is to insure city employees assigned to hope are not Duplicating the work of contracted outreach providers and staying within prescribed functions such as coordination and Prioritization.,146,,
1230,0.97,8117.075,8127.486,"I know it's difficult that when building something entirely new like hope, to always predict with 100% accuracy what functions and positions will be needed.",146,,
1231,0.97,8127.486,8130.222,I'd like to offer a little flexibility here.,146,,
1232,0.97,8130.222,8163.388,"I think the legislation passed on Monday along with the accompanying frame work and remainder of language in this budget action contain Guardrails I believe are sufficient, really focusing on the fact we don't want is we don't want the city functions assigned to hope is to be Duplicating the activities of the folks who are out in the field.",146,,
1233,0.97,8163.388,8163.955,Thank you.,146,,
1234,0.97,8163.955,8170.262,"Councilmember Morales, you spoke to items at beginning.",147,,
1235,0.97,8170.262,8171.096,Could you offer clarification?,147,,
1236,0.97,8171.096,8171.53,"Thank you, chair.",147,,
1237,0.97,8171.53,8181.873,"As I said, it didn't make it into the form B. we're flexible in terms of the number of roles of the Ftes.",147,,
1238,0.97,8181.873,8185.377,So I'm happy to continue having that conversation.,147,,
1239,0.97,8185.377,8194.753,I do want to say that we were on the phone last night with several different provider who is are eager to see this move forward.,147,,
1240,0.97,8194.753,8219.544,"They are eager to, as we were talking about during the outreach conversation, eager to see that work and have the additional conversation added to it about how we're going to invest in the actual housing part of this conversation.",147,,
1241,0.97,8219.544,8220.946,It's important we continue this conversation.,147,,
1242,0.97,8220.946,8221.913,This is not the end.,147,,
1243,0.97,8221.913,8228.787,"The language that is in the form B, I will say it is a bit prescriptive.",147,,
1244,0.97,8228.787,8243.535,We understand there's a desire to see flexibility in that and more flexibility in the funding and what things can be used for as well S. I do think all of that is part of the conversation that needs to continue.,147,,
1245,0.97,8243.535,8256.448,We need to think how this can become a program that is not about outreach but is a more comprehensive and Listic approach.,147,,
1246,0.97,8256.448,8263.855,We have invest sod much in outreach already and and know there are not enough places for people to go.,147,,
1247,0.97,8263.855,8275.634,"That's how we're going to solve homelessness by making sure that we have the permanent supportive housing, low barrier shelter, affordable housing.",147,,
1248,0.97,8275.634,8283.375,"We need people people as I've heard several colleagues say, we need places to navigate people to which is why we need to change the way we're doing it.",147,,
1249,0.97,8283.375,8294.352,I think this is an important first step in getting us there.,147,,
1250,0.97,8294.352,8294.886,Councilmember Herbold?,148,,
1251,0.97,8294.886,8295.287,"Yes, thank you.",148,,
1252,0.97,8295.287,8300.859,I appreciate your willingness to be flexible as it relates to the Hisd staffing level.,148,,
1253,0.97,8300.859,8311.102,I would like to add my name as a sponsor today in addition to your statement that you are willing to be flexible.,148,,
1254,0.97,8311.102,8334.793,"Will you, in the next it ration of this action have the FTE level be 8 so that I can agree to sponsor this today?",148,,
1255,0.97,8334.793,8342.334,Thank you for conversation around the scope of work and Ftes.,148,,
1256,0.97,8342.334,8343.268,"Councilmember Pederson, please go ahead.",148,,
1257,0.97,8343.268,8345.336,I appreciate the detailed discussion back and forth.,148,,
1258,0.97,8345.336,8357.048,That was helpful and really looking forward to the regional homelessness authority being up and running.,148,,
1259,0.97,8357.048,8363.855,I agree we need to build more permanent support of how Hassing and affordable permanent housing.,148,,
1260,0.97,8363.855,8371.362,I am very concerned with the initial draft of the proposal.,148,,
1261,0.97,8371.362,8396.688,I feel we agreed during this summer to that's where we went from 14 Hsd employees down to 8? I feel that accord was just reached.,148,,
1262,0.97,8396.688,8398.156,We vote on that days ago.,148,,
1263,0.97,8398.156,8404.429,I was viewing this as could be interpret as moving the Goalpost right after the cord was reached?,148,,
1264,0.97,8404.429,8430.622,I feel we need more support and coordination from--I want to lift up work of our Hisd employees that provide and care about reducing homelessness . We're tracking the information centrally.,148,,
1265,0.97,8430.622,8434.325,We're going to increase the trash pick up service for example.,148,,
1266,0.97,8434.325,8435.46,There's a lot of moving pieces.,148,,
1267,0.97,8435.46,8443.368,I want to make sure we have sufficient support is from our human services Department.,148,,
1268,0.97,8443.368,8445.703,"So to me, eight employees is too Fume we cut it from 14.",148,,
1269,0.97,8445.703,8455.28,I don't want to see it go in the smaller direction.,148,,
1270,0.97,8455.28,8455.58,Thank you.,148,,
1271,0.97,8455.58,8457.582,"Thank you, Councilmember Pederson.",149,,
1272,0.97,8457.582,8461.82,I see Council members Lewis and president Gonzalez.,149,,
1273,0.97,8461.82,8463.354,Thank you Madame chair.,149,,
1274,0.97,8463.354,8485.376,"I want to reflect that given the representations made in the exchange between Councilmember Morales and Herbold, I too am willing to be added to this point as a cosponsor given that new information on the subsequent draft to the proposal.",149,,
1275,0.97,8485.376,8509.534,"I wanted to make a moment to express appreciation for Councilmember Morales and Herbold's role in these ongoing difficult conversations to try to iron out the differences between the Council, providers, Mayor to come to a path forward and break the impasse.",149,,
1276,0.97,8509.534,8518.109,"It's been really great to have Councilmember Morales and Herbold in the room on that to do, to be doing that work.",149,,
1277,0.97,8518.109,8523.414,It's manifesting itself in a process that seems to be moving forward very well.,149,,
1278,0.97,8523.414,8530.455,Wanted to take a second to recognize their contributions.,149,,
1279,0.97,8530.455,8531.389,Well said.,150,,
1280,0.97,8531.389,8531.856,Thank you very much.,150,,
1281,0.97,8531.856,8533.424,Council President Gonzalez?,150,,
1282,0.97,8533.424,8543.835,Just wanted to make a couple comments quickly as to why I am adding my name as a cosponsor here.,151,,
1283,0.97,8543.835,8582.607,I'll start off by saying that thanks to Council member Morales and others working in the back ground to identify where we can--where the gaps are and how to bridge the gap as it relates to what the city plans to do collectively with providers who we rely on to provide critical services and with the Mayor's office who's responsible for the administration and the Operationallizing of what it is and helping us think about the policy frame work and strategy should be moving forward.,151,,
1284,0.97,8582.607,8588.212,Thank you to everybody who's been working on those particular issues.,151,,
1285,0.97,8588.212,8619.177,"We appreciate the flexibility of Council member through this conversation in this public and my second point, there's a lot of emphasis placed on the homelessness and I do know that the navigation team services were never slightly slated . There's a reason for that.",151,,
1286,0.97,8619.177,8648.239,"The reason for that is because the county didn't want to take on that model . given the voluminous amount of literature, that clearly tells us that having law enforcement working Hand- In-Hand with social service providers on doing outreach work is counterproductive.",151,,
1287,0.97,8648.239,8661.119,The ultimate goal of Transitioning people to other permanent or temporary housing options.,151,,
1288,0.97,8661.119,8662.954,The authority was never intended to house the team.,151,,
1289,0.97,8662.954,8673.731,They are intended to absorb many aspects of the homelessness outreach efforts and our strategies and interventions generally.,151,,
1290,0.97,8673.731,8701.959,"That does not absolve from the need to continue to do outreach and services . and I think, ultimately, it is important that the city council signal to the public and to the Mayor and our provider partners the general direction in which we are headed and that there has been conversation about how many bodies should be doing this work and I hope we are equally focused on what the work should be.",151,,
1291,0.97,8701.959,8763.654,In addition to how many people should be doing this important work . I think I is important to make sure the Council is providing counsel Mireles and others who are working on this issue with the support as many Councilmembers as we can get to allow her and the council member and the chair to be able to effectively negotiate on a consensus approach on how we are going to move beyond the navigation team and implement an outreach and provider Ecosystem that is really truly designed to do outreach and to outreach people and intervention that is appropriate to that people so we are happy to have my name as a cosponsor . There are many details being worked on.,151,,
1292,0.97,8763.654,8795.386,"And also in the spirit of offering a prime sponsor, my support in her efforts to continue to negotiate this on behalf of the city Council and in partnership with service providers and in collaboration with the Mayor's office and I am deeply appreciative of those ongoing efforts for all parties in the city government and our partners that we rely on deeply to actually provide these services.",151,,
1293,0.97,8795.386,8799.79,"Thank you, Madam chair.",151,,
1294,0.97,8799.79,8801.659,"Councilmember Strauss, please go ahead.",152,,
1295,0.97,8801.659,8805.263,Thank you chair and Council President.,153,,
1296,0.97,8805.263,8810.601,You summarized remarks better than I could.,153,,
1297,0.97,8810.601,8816.974,"Let's just say signaling a directional support for this proposal, understanding there are many details to iron out.",153,,
1298,0.97,8816.974,8834.325,"Council member her bold and Louis, your comments, questions and answers provided also made me feel comfortable signing on to single this is a direction that we want to go and that there are more details to be ironed out so thank you for all of your work on this.",153,,
1299,0.97,8834.325,8847.905,Thank you for the Mayor's office for continuing to work on this and for everyone getting to work together because we have got to work together to solve this crisis together.,153,,
1300,0.97,8847.905,8853.244,Are there any additional comments on this item?,154,,
1301,0.97,8853.244,8865.856,"Okay, I am going to offer as well as a symbol of my support for the ongoing negotiations to go ahead and add my name to this item.",155,,
1302,0.97,8865.856,8886.777,"I think that the Council colleagues have made a very important statement, not just about the policy and discussion but the intent to show United effort along with the executive office and our community partners that this is clearly an item that we are committed to finalizing.",155,,
1303,0.97,8886.777,8905.396,"I want to underscore the importance of the discussion today which identified not just flexibility on the number of FGE's but a real interest in making sure we get the scope of the work right, that this is not just about outreach but that through pledge into stable housing and as I understand, and a lot of details yet to be worked out.",155,,
1304,0.97,8905.396,8926.317,"Indicating my interest in making sure that this core issue, this core component of the budget continues to have the support for the ongoing negotiations, I want to echo my appreciation for the prime sponsor and for all of you who have been engaged in this conversation over the last few months and also to the Mayor's office.",155,,
1305,0.97,8926.317,8955.947,"The Mayor herself and along with the provider so we do look forward to hearing more about what those details are but I think showing that we want to come together and identify a path forward [Indiscernible] and really includes these production models and as the other Councilmembers have already said, really partners well with the community, trusted organizations . I see a lot of that coming together here.",155,,
1306,0.97,8955.947,8959.45,Clearly still a work in progress.,155,,
1307,0.97,8959.45,8974.065,I want to make sure that you know this is an area that we are going as a counsel want to see finalized for the budget is complete at the end of November.,155,,
1308,0.97,8974.065,8982.039,"The cosponsors include Strauss, Lewis, [Indiscernible] and Gonzales.",155,,
1309,0.97,8982.039,8989.68,"With that, let's go to the next item.",155,,
1310,0.97,8989.68,8991.983,The next item is item #15.,156,,
1311,0.97,8991.983,9012.903,Just to make sure . There is not an M6 . H1 71 provides [Indiscernible] report provides $1 million in general fund support to increase funding from crisis teams such as local crisis team.,156,,
1312,0.97,9012.903,9034.625,The EST mobile crisis team is currently a 43 member team . It currently berries a little bit . [Indiscernible] But it is a team that provides a connection to health services and the mobile crisis team is facing reduction in funding.,156,,
1313,0.97,9034.625,9057.148,"Its primary funding source is from mental illness and sales tax to the county and also there was not a [Indiscernible] provided for this contract this year by the county, not anticipated to be and as a result, the team is looking at a $750,000 short fall.",156,,
1314,0.97,9057.148,9064.922,"Expanding capacity by another $250,000 which would be three and four additional staff.",156,,
1315,0.97,9064.922,9065.856,Wonderful.,157,,

1375,0.97,9659.483,9666.757,Just a quick comment.,169,,
1376,0.97,9666.757,9674.831,I totally agree with everything said and it has been good to collaborate with her office on this priority.,169,,
1377,0.97,9674.831,9703.56,There is a very common sort of Trope of people who are critical of and approach to addressing the homeless crisis that people who are living in shelters don't live help and that there are plenty of shelters available and the only issues that they don't want to go . that is just manifestly not true and I know all of us here know that is not true and there is no better evidence of that than tiny House villages.,169,,
1378,0.97,9703.56,9716.106,Based on the experience that tiny houses are highly in demand among folks that they provide outreach to.,169,,
1379,0.97,9716.106,9730.921,"I prefer the same sentiments expressed by business improvement area directors, police officers, uniformly among anyone having any interaction with in sheltered people, they can confirm that tiny House villages are highly in demand and, yes!",169,,
1380,0.97,9730.921,9763.854,"There can be high rates of refusal or congregate shelters in the middle of the pandemic because people have agency and people where their choices and people way what is best for their health and safety and tiny House villages deliver on all of those factors and we really need to be structured and centered on what do our neighbors currently living on shelter need, what do they want and what will they accept offers to and tiny House villages check all of those boxes and we should definitely be adding more.",169,,
1381,0.97,9763.854,9780.871,"I do want to briefly flag, my hope is that we not put ourselves in a position where tiny House village expansion competes where Scaling up whole telling is a potential intervention.",169,,
1382,0.97,9780.871,9784.174,It is good to everyone I talked to to have a diverse portfolio of offerings.,169,,
1383,0.97,9784.174,9791.281,There are potential advantages to hotel rooms . hotel rooms are highly desirable.,169,,
1384,0.97,9791.281,9821.444,"I do want to make sure as this goes forward, we are not put into a position or Ratcheted down the commitment or request to expand to a, eight the tiny House but then we do both at the same time to increase the transitional shelter capacity to meet the crushing need that we are seeing in the city.",169,,

This is a portion of those funds to be used elsewhere.",170,,
1389,0.97,9884.774,9895.018,"Also, as identified, we will learn a little bit more about the site and I believe there are revisions to the cost and balance.",170,,

1392,0.97,9929.185,9945.835,"Given the Covid-19 pandemic and the ongoing crisis, I agree that well organized tiny House villages can be cost-effective as an intervention when combined with case management and Performance-Based contract with Hst.",171,,
1393,0.97,9945.835,9959.582,"We have seen a sharp rise in district for and on the Legwork of doing an actual suitable side, a short-term location for a tiny House village, this would enable us to expeditiously address this need of finding shelter with case management.",171,,
1394,0.97,9959.582,9978.301,"Based on research, we believe this amount of 1.65 could come down by at least $150,000 based on the condition of the site which is a good condition to start up right away.",171,,
1395,0.97,9985.608,9989.879,Thank you very much and I also know that Councilmember Juarez has indicated [Indiscernible] as well.,172,,
1396,0.97,9989.879,9991.748,I see Councilman Lewis and [Indiscernible].,172,,
1397,0.97,9991.748,10010.266,[Indiscernible] Councilmember Peterson for his extremely energetic [Indiscernible] and his responsiveness to some of my questions last week specifically around possible cost savings due to the state of the site.,173,,
1398,0.97,10010.266,10034.824,"It is a site I was familiar with and in supporting temporary buildings for a while through sound transit, the possibility that could save money and I appreciate the diligence in following up on that and coming back this weekend demonstrating but yes, due to the site, there are some where we can stretch this limited dollars a little bit more.",173,,
1399,0.97,10034.824,10035.825,I just really appreciate that.,173,,
1400,0.97,10035.825,10097.754,I also further want to make a point that my office has been receiving a lot of Emails about this project from people in the Councilman's district who are not organized and I really just want to say at a time when we are getting a lot of constituent Emails about homelessness and those constituent Emails are not always framed in compassion for the people who are living in sheltered . Councilman Peterson with his office and team did outreach to really direct that energy in a very positive and compassionate direction in advocating for this policy and it is having a material impact where we are being lobbied by constituencies who do not always obvious for a tiny House village and I really appreciate that and also the groundwork like the maps and the plans that were distributed and Councilman Peterson's newsletter and what it could look like.,173,,
1401,0.97,10097.754,10106.896,And I think this will be a great site and a successful site for the tiny House village and I am happy to support those.,173,,
1402,0.97,10106.896,10109.866,"Councilmember Lewis, go ahead.",174,,
1403,0.97,10109.866,10116.406,Thank you.,175,,
1404,0.97,10116.406,10118.441,I would be otherwise very excited to support this proposal.,175,,
1405,0.97,10118.441,10120.376,I am really concerned about the suggested source of funds.,175,,
1406,0.97,10120.376,10149.939,"As it relates to the suggestion, I am concerned that dipping into funds that are intended for these hotel rooms, that is part of the marriage proposed sort of throughput approach to address moving folks off the street, into at least hotel rooms.",175,,
1407,0.97,10149.939,10159.349,I agree that tiny home villages are also very attractive and desirable places to go from the street.,175,,
1408,0.97,10159.349,10163.153,Just like hotel rooms.,175,,
1409,0.97,10163.153,10194.15,"I am also concerned that the other pots of money here are things that I have either, I have historically epic and more I am currently on this budget advocating for the $9 million rapid Rehousing in the 2021 budget . It is not sufficient to meet the need and there are people who are receiving rapid Rehousing vouchers right now who will be come homeless because of the length of stay.",175,,
1410,0.97,10194.15,10211.367,"People are experiencing rapid Rehousing program so I am, I actually have a budget proposal to expand rapid Rehousing about this $9 million . Finally, the homeless diversion funds are funds that I have been advocating for.",175,,
1411,0.97,10211.367,10219.409,We have not had a centralized homeless diversion fund for outreach workers to access.,175,,
1412,0.97,10219.409,10228.751,Or for the team to access . It is a central recommendation of the city auditor several years ago.,175,,
1413,0.97,10228.751,10232.822,That we should be able to access the diversion Fund.,175,,
1414,0.97,10232.822,10250.34,"Last year, the city works to get the navigation team trained on how to access the diversion Fund and just as they became trained, the centralized diversion fund was depleted.",175,,
1415,0.97,10250.34,10261.651,"And this budget corrects that and I think it is a really important engagement, intervention for folks who are living outside.",175,,
1416,0.97,10261.651,10264.153,"So, again, support the effort.",175,,
1417,0.97,10264.153,10271.594,Concerned about the impacts of these identified funds to address other needs that I have been strongly advocating for.,175,,
1418,0.97,10277.1,10280.97,"Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, please go ahead.",176,,
1419,0.97,10280.97,10314.103,"In addition to looking at the cost side of things for this particular village and reducing the cost to 1.5, I don't know if you are prepared to talk about calculations on providing the 300 hotel rooms and where it might be some differences in numbers . There might be more funds available.",177,,
1420,0.97,10314.103,10341.898,"Obviously, this would be a discretion, budgetary as the packages put together but I have gone through and looked at the estimate cost that the executive provided both for activities at the end of 2020 using S2 funds and the 2020 resources in the allocation so first I want to look at the, the executive has provided cost.",178,,
1421,0.97,10341.898,10363.619,"Hotel rooms in order to be a Non-Congregant shelter . and just looking at those costs and projecting them out over the times when we are told and the number of units, there seems to be about a $365,000 padding in the amount incurred by the executive.",178,,
1422,0.97,10363.619,10369.726,That primarily comes from the resources provided that would be used the first couple of months.,178,,
1423,0.97,10369.726,10381.971,It is actually money that the executive has said will begin using this in 2020 and 2021.,178,,
1424,0.97,10381.971,10398.388,It is $3 million even though it looks like it is only going to cost around $2.6 million and also I NOTE at this time that we haven't seen the budget proposed beginning the use of these hotel rooms on November 1.,178,,
1425,0.97,10398.388,10457.447,"In two days time, it is my knowledge that we neither have a provider operating these hotel rooms if not already posted is being distributed at this point but as it seems unlikely that the executive will be able to continue the operation of these by November 1 which Councilmembers are aware is quite earlier that we would be providing through legislation and finally, the third place that I have been double checking the executive's analysis, again, use numbers that they have provided based on the 125 new shelters they hope to provide and just using the numbers they have provided and multiplying it out, it seems like there is an overestimation of about $270,000 for that project in 2021. if you add all of that together, that does open up a substantial amount of space that could be supported.",178,,
1426,0.97,10457.447,10481.07,"Most of them are Efg funds related to homelessness and as customer Peterson noted, also revisions to the actual cost and for example, the site that has been proposed, utility stubs are still in place.",178,,
1427,0.97,10481.07,10493.282,All of this to reduce the start up cost so we are still looking at a final number but I think it would certainly be less than what is displayed [Indiscernible].,178,,

1444,0.97,10628.517,10629.619,I found this conversation helpful.,186,,
1445,0.97,10629.619,10641.998,"I have additional questions about upcoming items that I have my name on so, Jeff, we may need your expertise as we think about how these funding sources Interweave.",186,,
1446,0.97,10641.998,10649.638,"The council member, I appreciate your comments and your ongoing support for this type of Non-Congregant shelter option.",186,,
1447,0.97,10649.638,10654.944,Looks like there are handful of hands that were added so let me read those.,186,,
1448,0.97,10654.944,10667.023,"Councilman Pedersen is joined by Council members Kshama Sawant, Jucez, Strauss, and Council member President Gonzalez.",186,,
1449,0.97,10667.023,10668.057,Let's go to the next one.,186,,
1450,0.97,10668.057,10672.161,Item number 18 on the agenda is CBA HON 10 81.,187,,
1451,0.97,10672.161,10683.939,This is put forth by Council member Sawant.,187,,
1452,0.97,10684.807,10688.144,"Council member Sawant come in provide $655,000 in the general fund to support 24-hour operations of basic shelters.",187,,
1453,0.97,10688.144,10706.295,For some context for Council members this was provided previously during the pandemic a lot of the programs were targeted with the's funds and the operate in facilities that are Faith-Based institutions and because of the pandemic they were not utilizing spaces that they otherwise would use for basic shelters to exist in.,187,,
1454,0.97,10706.295,10726.382,"Over the course of the year funds were provided to these organizations, especially share will, primarily share real, to increase the hours of operation so instead of having people stay not on the floor Overnights, they would stay in these locations all day long and this proposal would Annualize that amount.",187,,
1455,0.97,10726.382,10738.727,Last year it was approximately does I don't have Ridley--here it is.,187,,
1456,0.97,10738.727,10743.432,"$265,000 provided Lester between the county in the city to support those 24-hour services Annualizing that would be about $353,000.",187,,
1457,0.97,10743.432,10756.545,"And after consultation with the providers, other cost of they are hoping to address a variety of changes.",187,,
1458,0.97,10756.545,10757.646,The normal staff wage increases.,187,,
1459,0.97,10757.646,10758.814,Health benefits for the staff.,187,,
1460,0.97,10758.814,10781.337,Adding more part-time employees and making changes to the offerings as well as assumptions about increased maintenance they have to incur or increased utility cost utilizing these facilities for longer periods.,187,,
1461,0.97,10781.337,10782.872,"The total cost for the CBA is $655,000.",187,,
1462,0.97,10782.872,10784.74,As I mentioned the primary sponsor is Council member Sawant.,187,,
1463,0.97,10784.74,10785.241,Thank you.,188,,
1464,0.97,10785.241,10785.774,Council member Sawant?,188,,
1465,0.97,10785.774,10786.375,Thank you.,189,,
1466,0.97,10786.375,10794.25,"Thank you, Jeff, for that description and thank you to Council member Juarez and Gonzalez for the support.",189,,
1467,0.97,10794.25,10811.867,"As was mentioned is what at $650,000 to services . to contract with nonprofit organizations such as share wheel to maintain 24 hour operations of basic shelters.",189,,
1468,0.97,10811.867,10829.885,Basic shelters are the shelters that do not have many of the services provided because there isn't enough shelter space and we need to protect every shelter bed possible.,189,,
1469,0.97,10829.885,10834.623,Also the fact that the share wheel shelter allows them to build a community and a way that other shelters even enhanced shelters often cannot.,189,,
1470,0.97,10834.623,10855.344,This year the basic shelters that share and will operate will provide extra funding to allow them to provide 24 hour service . We heard testimonials as to how it makes a difference and we would impact the people directly that enhance the services and how great it would be to have a 24 hour service.,189,,
1471,0.97,10855.344,10866.422,"We also know it is essential, especially now, to help keep people safe during Covid.",189,,
1472,0.97,10866.422,10871.26,Even without Covid we know that the 24 hours shelter is a huge improvement compared to having it overnight.,189,,
1473,0.97,10871.26,10876.732,For House people is like imagining not being able to go home during the day or even to use the bathroom.,189,,
1474,0.97,10876.732,10889.078,The residents are fighting to maintain 24 operations for the share shelters in 2021 and this budget amendment . that would make this funding possible.,189,,
1475,0.97,10889.078,10892.281,Thank you.,190,,
1476,0.97,10892.281,10896.986,Additional comments or questions?,190,,
1477,0.97,10896.986,10897.553,Okay.,191,,
1478,0.97,10897.553,10900.556,I am not seeing any comments or questions.,191,,
1479,0.97,10900.556,10901.49,I wanted to ask.,191,,
1480,0.97,10901.49,10936.191,"We were talking about this last week if I remember correctly picked the question was whether or not it is 600,000 plus dollar amount was just for two sites or what with the amount be for over all across the city.",191,,
1481,0.97,10936.191,10938.027,"Jeff, did you have a chance to look into that?",191,,
1482,0.97,10938.027,10942.932,My understanding is this is not just talk about two sites because the nature of how share and we'll work with you Space- based institutions.,192,,
1483,0.97,10942.932,10945.934,There is often a rotation said done . stay and one facility at all times.,192,,
1484,0.97,10945.934,10949.305,This is intended to encompass the entirety of share and we'll's operations across their locations.,192,,
1485,0.97,10949.305,10951.14,Grade.,193,,
1486,0.97,10951.14,10969.158,"So it is $650,000 total to be able to convert these basic shelters into 24/7 shelters . I should not say basic . I guess I can say basic.",193,,
1487,0.97,10969.158,10970.192,"These are basic shelters, correct?",193,,
1488,0.97,10970.192,10971.06,That is correct.,194,,
1489,0.97,10971.06,10976.265,These would still be what we call basic shelters because we would not be adding the type of services that we refer to as an enhanced shelter.,194,,
1490,0.97,10976.265,10992.448,A lot of that as the council member noted due to the length of the space limitations that the shelters operate in so this would allow the presence of people for a 24 hour.,194,,
1491,0.97,10992.448,10998.787,However it would not move these from being basic shelters and start providing case management and other types of services that make it become an enhanced shelter.,194,,
1492,0.97,10998.787,10999.755,Rates.,195,,
1493,0.97,10999.755,11004.393,Thank you for following up.,195,,
1494,0.97,11004.393,11005.427,"Anything else, council member Sawant.",195,,
1495,0.97,11005.427,11007.596,Thank you to Jeff for the thorough responses.,196,,
1496,0.97,11007.596,11012.868,Thank you.,197,,
1497,0.97,11012.868,11021.677,The council member is joined by the Council President Gonzalez and Council member Herbold.,197,,
1498,0.97,11021.677,11027.683,The next item number 19 is CBA Hom is CBA Hom11-01.,198,,
1499,0.97,11027.683,11040.229,"That's as $1 million, a little more than $1 million to general Fund and $110 million to age is due to continue operation in city hall of basic shelter events.",198,,
1500,0.97,11040.229,11079.768,As the Councilmembers are aware there is a substantial amount of funding over the course of 2020 that has allowed for the D intensification of shelters in order to increase social distancing and provide other types of protections as well as the equipment necessary such as Ppe or masks and things like that for the staff and residents and as a result of that many of the expanded spaces that have been used to spread out the existing number of shelter beds and other types of modifications will be able to be returned back to locations.,198,,
1501,0.97,11079.768,11082.237,In particular though there will be a new location opening Ana Soto.,198,,
1502,0.97,11082.237,11098.554,I'm not sure how many Councilmembers had a chance to explore this . This is where the majority of the programs operated by the Salvation Army will be moving to including--initially the shelter that has been operating in city hall would move to that location.,198,,
1503,0.97,11098.554,11113.635,"They have also, the city hall shelters come and many of the individuals that utilize that shelter come have been staying in Fisher pavilion during the pandemic all these programs will be moving to the Sodo shelter.",198,,
1504,0.97,11113.635,11121.21,"The county programs also operated by salvation Army in the county administration building, for example, will eventually have everyone moving on the same day.",198,,
1505,0.97,11121.21,11131.32,I understand there are other plans for this facility as well.,198,,
1506,0.97,11131.32,11139.228,With that then the city would not be continuing at this time to provide the shelter beds that are basic shelter beds in city hall.,198,,
1507,0.97,11139.228,11158.547,So this proposal would continue that funding and the proposal right now from the executive is that the city hall shelter would be maintained as a storm shelter.,198,,
1508,0.97,11158.547,11159.515,Or a search filter.,198,,
1509,0.97,11159.515,11162.651,"We've seen both in the last two years when there has been snow, especially extreme weather.",198,,
1510,0.97,11162.651,11173.962,"There has been expansion, usually within utilizing the Seattle center to have some additional basic shelter space so that individuals unsheltered can come inside.",198,,
1511,0.97,11173.962,11179.568,That's with the executive plans to use City hall for currently but this could actually support the continuation of the basic shelter that has been operating in city hall.,198,,
1512,0.97,11179.568,11185.44,The sponsor of this is Council President Gonzalez.,198,,
1513,0.97,11185.44,11185.941,Thank you.,199,,
1514,0.97,11185.941,11186.508,Council President Gonzalez?,199,,
1515,0.97,11186.508,11187.643,Thank you.,200,,
1516,0.97,11187.643,11201.29,Really quickly . over the past year Hsd's use of city hall is an overnight basic shelter facility has been a welcome addition to our city shelter infrastructure.,200,,
1517,0.97,11201.29,11205.06,"And this year's budget, this funding was not included.",200,,
1518,0.97,11205.06,11219.341,And I understand the motivation for this budget reduction is Hsd's belief they will be unable to identify a provider to operate the shelter as Jeff just mentioned.,200,,
1519,0.97,11219.341,11224.913,The current operator will be moving their operations to the new Sodo site and as a result may not have capacity to continue operating the city hall shelter.,200,,
1520,0.97,11224.913,11240.128,"My office is going to continue to work with Council central staff, service providers and Hsd to see if there is a possibility of identifying an interested operator for this additional shelter capacity.",200,,
1521,0.97,11240.128,11265.42,If it does become clear that this funding will not be needed for the city hall shelter then it's my understanding that even without this funding as Jeff just mentioned Hsd does continue to intend to use City Hall as a flexible surge shelter space to provide additional emergency shelter beds during cold weather events this winter similar to the ones we have experienced in the past 2-3 years.,200,,
1522,0.97,11265.42,11283.438,There is some flexibility here and a little bit of work that needs to happen but my hope is we will be able to realize this funding in order to continue to bolster the city's shelter infrastructure through the use of a city hall facility.,200,,
1523,0.97,11283.438,11288.477,Thank you.,200,,
1524,0.97,11288.477,11289.578,"Thank you, Council President.",201,,
1525,0.97,11289.578,11290.579,Thank you.,202,,
1526,0.97,11290.579,11299.388,"I am indicating my sponsorship, co-sponsors of this.",202,,
1527,0.97,11299.388,11302.19,I think Madam Presiden for bringing this forward.,202,,
1528,0.97,11302.19,11309.698,"There has been a shelter operating in city hall, in this city hall, since it opened in 2001.",202,,
1529,0.97,11309.698,11345.5,"The intent when it was first built was not to include the shelter that was actually in the previous City Hall and I remember there was a campaign led by advocates called, behind the Red doors and that was the campaign to open up the area behind the Red doors at City hall to allow the shelter at City Hall that had been in the previous voting to continue in 2001 in this particular new City Hall.",202,,
1530,0.97,11345.5,11386.942,"I think it's a really important statement about the city's commitment to use its own resources and facilities to support folks who are living unsheltered and, again, until I saw Madam President's recommendation to include this, I had no idea there was a plan to end it and, again, this is a commitment that goes longer than 20 years to provide this service in our city's building that is sort of our civic on.",202,,
1531,0.97,11386.942,11389.177,Today for doing that.,202,,
1532,0.97,11389.177,11395.751,Thank you very much.,203,,
1533,0.97,11395.751,11397.786,I do want to ask a quick question on this.,203,,
1534,0.97,11397.786,11402.491,I just want to double check.,203,,
1535,0.97,11402.491,11403.625,Was there any Caveats included here?,203,,
1536,0.97,11403.625,11418.006,I do not see it in the summary about opening this backup when Covid conditions improve or is this just making sure that the funding is there for the full calendar year?,203,,
1537,0.97,11418.006,11420.509,My belief is that is for the full calendar year.,204,,
1538,0.97,11420.509,11435.524,"The city hall space is an interesting space so the shelter used to be primarily located downstairs behind the Redwall, as the Councilmember just reminded us of that historical perspective.",204,,
1539,0.97,11435.524,11447.636,There was at some point and expansion of the operations to allow formats to be placed on the first floor of the main floor which is much more spread out.,204,,
1540,0.97,11447.636,11474.863,"I think there is an opportunity here to look at how the city hall shelter beds can be structured in a way to have appropriate social distancing and further contribute to the city's D Densification strategies as a relates to congregate shelter and that may come I frankly, require a little bit more resources.",204,,
1541,0.97,11474.863,11482.37,Happy to take a further look at that question and would ask for Jeff's support in making sure that we track that particular issue as you have highlighted it.,204,,
1542,0.97,11482.37,11487.442,Thank you,205,,
1543,0.97,11487.442,11488.543,Thank you very much.,206,,
1544,0.97,11488.543,11489.611,Spend additional comments or questions?,206,,
1545,0.97,11489.611,11490.245,Okay.,206,,
1546,0.97,11490.245,11496.051,Wonderful.,206,,
1547,0.97,11496.051,11503.191,I see a number of folks who have signed on so Council President Gonzalez has signed back on.,206,,
1548,0.97,11503.191,11503.558,Okay.,206,,
1549,0.97,11503.558,11505.393,Let's go to the next one.,206,,
1550,0.97,11505.393,11509.898,Number 20 on the agenda.,207,,
1551,0.97,11509.898,11524.379,The city provides $2.5 million of emergency solutions grant funding one time funding and Hsd to acquire a facility or emergent disease shelter for housing.,207,,
1552,0.97,11524.379,11530.519,This is put forward by Councilmember Lewis.,207,,
1553,0.97,11530.519,11533.922,Thank you.,208,,
1554,0.97,11533.922,11538.627,"Councilmember Lewis, please go ahead.",208,,
1555,0.97,11538.627,11539.995,We can come back --,208,,
1556,0.97,11539.995,11549.137,Yes.,209,,
1557,0.97,11549.137,11551.54,Getting to the little mute button was hard there for some reason.,209,,
1558,0.97,11551.54,11552.507,No problem.,210,,
1559,0.97,11552.507,11566.755,This is a proposal similar when we were here last week talking about that Councilmember Strauss to put forward and I appreciate working with her office on this.,211,,
1560,0.97,11566.755,11592.581,This is really a joint proposal from us . If there is an ability to to jointly primary sponsor rate that would be appropriate here but we have been talking to the same folks who are interested in exploring a way to use this Esd money to acquire a hotel or some other facility for transitional shelter and ultimately permanent supportive housing.,211,,
1561,0.97,11592.581,11626.715,"This is somethin that I think could be an interesting arrangement . in the context of Bay telling ambitions in this budget to potentially squeeze more value out of a third of those units if, for example, we help to provide or acquire a 100 unit hotel and then entered into a more favorable piece but that is sort of dependent on maybe talking to Hsd and the executive side about how some kind of arrangement like that may impact their plant next year.",211,,
1562,0.97,11626.715,11641.93,I would think that it could be a way to take full advantage of this temporary money to create a permanent resource.,211,,
1563,0.97,11641.93,11644.532,"Designed around expanding our shelter capacity with high- quality, highly desirable units.",211,,
1564,0.97,11644.532,11664.052,"And from talking to some providers, they are very detailed and thoughtful proposals about how this could be done and be done quickly with hotels that are sort of a Turnkey operation where we could get people inside very fast.",211,,
1565,0.97,11664.052,11686.374,"And also potentially with more long-term reliability because we would not need to be in a position where a lease expires in 10 months or there's pressures for tourism and travel to resume . essentially for all Intents and purposes Úthey become part of our Broade system of transitional shelter and ultimately with some improvements around Kitchenettes or whatever, permanent supportive housing if there's other things that are needed for the code.",211,,
1566,0.97,11686.374,11713.168,"That could be particularly attractive given that as we know from a lot of work, the provider community has done in analyzing the costs, they cost about $320,000 per unit to build affordable, permanent supportive housing . Some of these proposals I've seen from providers could be $170,000 per unit and terms of the cost of acquiring hotels in then retrofitting them.",211,,
1567,0.97,11713.168,11727.215,I think this is a creative way to use this money to build lasting change and I do think there is still some conversations that need to happen on the executive and in terms of appetite for implementing and pursuing this.,211,,
1568,0.97,11727.215,11744.299,I know that King County is putting a lot of resources into acquiring hotels through their sales tax and bonding program as well and there might be some room for collaboration there.,211,,
1569,0.97,11744.299,11752.14,But in the meantime if there are providers out there who are interested in engaging in this kind of partnership and I think it's something we should provide the opportunity for them and the executive to pursue.,211,,
1570,0.97,11752.14,11755.009,Additional comments.,212,,
1571,0.97,11755.009,11755.744,Please go ahead.,212,,
1572,0.97,11755.744,11756.444,Thank you.,213,,
1573,0.97,11756.444,11780.468,"Thank you to Councilmember Lewis, likewise for the excellent opportunity we had to work together on this and also on the tiny House proposal that we just talked about and to add to that comments that are made by Councilmember Lewis.",213,,
1574,0.97,11780.468,11796.985,"I would say, yes, this is a really important opportunity and there are millions and bested in renting hotel rooms from For-Profit hotels to shelter homeless people and especially distance way which is the right thing to do.",213,,
1575,0.97,11796.985,11809.364,"Do everything in our power to save lives but this proposal, it would be even better because the building could serve another purpose after the health emergency in providing permanent, affordable housing.",213,,
1576,0.97,11809.364,11815.003,"So, this idea is that this is a well thought out proposal.",213,,
1577,0.97,11815.003,11823.211,They have identified and I would urge Councilmembers to support this.,213,,
1578,0.97,11823.211,11831.686,I see your hand as well.,214,,
1579,0.97,11831.686,11832.487,Thank you.,215,,
1580,0.97,11832.487,11851.606,"Similar to my earlier comments around the housing surge proposal from the Mayor and its connection to the success of the hope program, council voted early this week to approve a new approach to encampment management and homelessness outreach.",215,,
1581,0.97,11851.606,11865.053,That approach is been Codeveloped by out reach providers and it's important that we have the agreement of the Mayor's office.,215,,
1582,0.97,11865.053,11874.262,The legislation was accompanied by a framework that includes shared principles and that framework was shared with Councilmembers and is available also publicly.,215,,
1583,0.97,11874.262,11902.357,"Part of those principles is a statement where they are seeking to support current resources allocated to relocate 425 additional people from unsafe conditions on the street into safe lodging . for example, temporary hotels and enhanced shelter through outreach that leads to placement and lodging appropriate to the needs of individuals given available resources.",215,,
1584,0.97,11902.357,11909.097,So this is the framework that outreach providers gave to us this week.,215,,
1585,0.97,11909.097,11918.106,"Again, we are not at mission accomplished on the whole issue of encampment management and outreach.",215,,
1586,0.97,11918.106,11929.517,"There are a lot of questions to be answered but this surge, housing placement initiative, is a really important part of those conversations.",215,,
1587,0.97,11929.517,11935.924,The Mayor's budget uses Esg funds to open up 325 short-term shelter.,215,,
1588,0.97,11935.924,11950.004,"Shelter or Hoe telling beds and uses that surge investment for housing support programs like diversion and rapid Rehousing, as mentioned earlier.",215,,
1589,0.97,11950.004,11970.058,"At the budget presentation on October 2, the deputy Mayor and Hsd director Johnson spoke to this new investment and indicated that 425 new beds would be stood up and available later this year making it essential that the funding is continued into 2021 as well.",215,,
1590,0.97,11970.058,11981.869,They described the plan as one that Pares the new outreach approach that we are all working on together with the surge investment in New shelter and hotel units.,215,,
1591,0.97,11981.869,11993.481,"The rapid Rehousing and new diversion resources and the 600 units of permanent, supportive housing that will be coming on next year.",215,,
1592,0.97,11993.481,12013.001,"So, I'm really seeking to make sure that what is being proposed today is additive, not intended to replace the Mayor's plan for the hotel and strategy.",215,,
1593,0.97,12013.001,12030.985,I am definitely interested in this proposal but I'm also really interested to know what the total purchase price is for the hotel and how the remainder would be financed.,215,,
1594,0.97,12030.985,12063.05,"The information I received about this hotel purchase is that in addition to the $2.5 million in acquisition, the operator would also need the city's hotel lease rate for 102 units . and I understand that there are further requests to the city that would be necessary to help pay for the hotel and, again, this is 102 units versus the 300 units under the Mayor's proposal.",215,,
1595,0.97,12063.05,12086.474,"So, again, just want to hear that this is additive, not intended to replace the hotel and strategy that is planning to come Online very soon without additional resources as opposed to replacing that strategy with this one which is for one third of the units.",215,,
1596,0.97,12086.474,12093.581,"Not going to require a lot more City resources, and not likely to come on as quickly as the hotel and strategy well.",215,,
1597,0.97,12093.581,12094.549,Thank you.,215,,
1598,0.97,12094.549,12101.689,"Thank you, Councilmember.",216,,
1599,0.97,12101.689,12109.897,If there is a Councilmember--is there any technical feedback as well.,216,,
1600,0.97,12109.897,12111.499,You are welcome to Chime in.,216,,
1601,0.97,12111.499,12114.602,I would defer to central staff at this point.,217,,
1602,0.97,12114.602,12130.551,"As I alluded to in my earlier comments I don't at this point really have any of those updates so if central staff does, they may be waiting more for the next round of our discussions.",217,,
1603,0.97,12130.551,12132.22,Can you provide some additional detail here.,218,,
1604,0.97,12132.22,12141.629,The $2.5 million proposed under this CBA is the maximum allowable under federal regulation.,218,,
1605,0.97,12141.629,12148.936,Typically we are not able to use and $32 for the acquisition of a facility at all.,218,,
1606,0.97,12148.936,12151.939,Special rose with the Coven amounts that allow us to spend up to $2.5 million.,218,,
1607,0.97,12151.939,12153.441,That's why that number was chosen here.,218,,
1608,0.97,12153.441,12156.944,$2.5 million would not be to purchase or renovate the facility.,218,,
1609,0.97,12156.944,12165.653,I will speculate on the exact amount but I have heard numbers that are substantially higher than that and it seems incredibly unlikely to supply that.,218,,
1610,0.97,12165.653,12170.191,To Councilmember Herbold question.,218,,
1611,0.97,12170.191,12202.557,"There needs to be some type of Trade-Off if these funds were to be taken to acquire a hotel that was not also the hotel that is then released by the city, I don't know the details of what it sounds like is only a proposal but if we're talking about two different locations then we would be talking about a reduction in funding for those 300 units that would be least hotel rooms along with their services that are intended to be split up this year.",218,,
1612,0.97,12202.557,12208.563,You referred to a total of 425 beds.,218,,
1613,0.97,12208.563,12228.616,It is correct that approximately--between Esg money both in 2020 and 2021--let's just talk 2021 so we don't confuse the issue.,218,,
1614,0.97,12228.616,12231.419,We would talk about $15.8 million in 2021 between Esg and CDBG funds.,218,,
1615,0.97,12231.419,12237.024,"That would support about 300 are an estimated 300 hotel room, Non-Congregant shelter beds.",218,,
1616,0.97,12237.024,12247.001,An additional 125 units to get to the 425 total are actually the intended acquisition of some facility.,218,,
1617,0.97,12247.001,12248.636,I do not have the details of that.,218,,
1618,0.97,12248.636,12257.645,Is not a proposal that Hsd would not be acquiring the facility that we understand a variety of locations are under consideration.,218,,
1619,0.97,12257.645,12283.738,The 125 units are maintained with General fund dollars so they would not be in direct competition here and I can't speak to whether or not the facility in question is necessarily--but there is likely some impacts on the ability to support a 300 hotel rooms that would be least if $2.5 million of these funds were requested.,218,,
1620,0.97,12283.738,12284.472,"Okay, Jeff.",219,,
1621,0.97,12284.472,12297.251,I am thinking a Flowchart may be helpful after the last two conversations.,219,,
1622,0.97,12297.251,12308.996,"I was just noting from my team that I think I need to go back and listen to the last half hour and a little more detail so if others are having similar questions or if it's all fair to you, that's great but if Úthere some visual that might B able to accompany this conversation, that would be Helpful.Council member Herbold?",219,,
1623,0.97,12308.996,12330.985,"I want to again say that our abode on Monday included a framework and that was a framework given to us by providers and in that framework this telling strategy, the Mayor's proposed telling strategy is included.",220,,
1624,0.97,12330.985,12339.927,I just don't want an effort here to contradict our support of that framework earlier this week.,220,,
1625,0.97,12339.927,12340.728,Thank you.,221,,
1626,0.97,12340.728,12347.301,Important point until he noted I see Allie on the screen and I would go to Councilmember Sawant after that.,221,,
1627,0.97,12347.301,12348.235,Thank you.,222,,
1628,0.97,12348.235,12362.65,I want to clarify one point that Jeff made and I will focus more on it but this is a question of Trade-Offs.,222,,
1629,0.97,12362.65,12388.376,"I think of $2.5 million of the Esg funds are used to acquire a facility you can think about it either as the funds from Esg to support the 300 cell rooms would be supported for a shorter amount of time, 300 rooms for about 10 months six months until the new hotel is Online.",222,,
1630,0.97,12388.376,12403.19,"But the investment, if the city was able to acquire a hotel over the long term, there would be more rooms available for a longer-term so it is--or it would be fewer rooms for the same amount of time.",222,,
1631,0.97,12403.19,12406.193,It would be $2.5 million out of the leasing strategy and directing it towards acquisition.,222,,
1632,0.97,12406.193,12412.066,We just don't know when that acquisition piece would be stood up and what the total cost from the city would be.,222,,
1633,0.97,12412.066,12415.436,[Captioners Transitioning],223,,
1634,0.97,12435.556,12438.325,[Captioners Transitioning,224,,
1635,0.97,12439.093,12460.214,"I was concerned and it Allie's description of the Trade-Offs, it is not a Trade- off among this particular number of dollars, because there is an unknown number of dollars that this proposal would need in order to be completed.",225,,
1636,0.97,12460.214,12468.522,We don't know how much more city dollars they would be seeking an order to purchase this hotel.,225,,
1637,0.97,12468.522,12472.259,"Thank you, Councilmember --",226,,
1638,0.97,12472.259,12473.127,I'm sorry.,227,,
1639,0.97,12473.127,12478.132,Go ahead.,227,,
1640,0.97,12478.132,12479.166,I'm sorry.,227,,
1641,0.97,12479.166,12481.669,Folks we are going to get your break here in a minute.,227,,
1642,0.97,12481.669,12482.87,Please go ahead.,227,,
1643,0.97,12482.87,12483.37,It's okay.,227,,
1644,0.97,12483.37,12496.25,I thought counsel person--was trying to speak.,228,,
1645,0.97,12497.351,12508.062,I would say this is a provider.,229,,
1646,0.97,12508.062,12515.769,Because we are in a in a--situation where whatever services we provide it's not like it is going to go away.,229,,
1647,0.97,12515.769,12526.313,Because there is such a huge problem and housing and security.,229,,
1648,0.97,12526.313,12537.691,"-- make it so the additive, of course I would not be--and I would strongly champion that.",229,,
1649,0.97,12537.691,12541.629,I would say just in general there is an advantage to purchasing a hotel.,229,,
1650,0.97,12541.629,12551.939,Because anything used for affordable housing afterwards other than just giving it as money for the proper hotel owner is going to be happy.,229,,
1651,0.97,12551.939,12554.775,The city should have something.,229,,
1652,0.97,12554.775,12558.445,In fact to have more for housing than anything else.,229,,
1653,0.97,12558.445,12569.156,Ultimately that is the root of the lack of affordable housing.,229,,
1654,0.97,12569.156,12578.332,"But as far as, just Lastly as far as the question of, we do not know how much we need to complete this project.",229,,
1655,0.97,12578.332,12579.366,We can have that dollar figure.,229,,
1656,0.97,12579.366,12582.169,No doubt.,229,,
1657,0.97,12582.169,12589.276,The provider--and will be able to.,229,,
1658,0.97,12589.276,12589.576,Sometime.,229,,
1659,0.97,12589.576,12594.682,"The point I'm trying to make, we have so much need in our community.",229,,
1660,0.97,12594.682,12607.995,"I don't think we should be, on just taken by how much debate there is on many small amounts for very real problems that need to be solved.",229,,
1661,0.97,12607.995,12613.867,In all of these dollars could be easily made available by expanding progressive revenues.,229,,
1662,0.97,12613.867,12616.303,And that's with the city council should be doing.,229,,
1663,0.97,12616.303,12616.704,Thank you.,230,,
1664,0.97,12616.704,12618.973,Thank you very much.,231,,
1665,0.97,12618.973,12621.208,So I am going to see if there is any less comments.,231,,
1666,0.97,12621.208,12627.381,I don't see any hams I know.,231,,
1667,0.97,12627.381,12629.516,I do think this composition about acquisition of Wallace about done.,231,,
1668,0.97,12629.516,12633.387,We will put a Timeout for a quick second to take a lunch break for a full hour.,231,,
1669,0.97,12633.387,12643.731,And want to make sure that we do continue as other Councilmembers of said and see how these pieces interact with the overall acquisition Úefforts.,231,,
1670,0.97,12643.731,12649.57,So we will pick up again on an acquisition related topic and when we come back from our break.,231,,
1671,0.97,12649.57,12655.075,Councilmember Warez has let me know her questions were answered and sentiments were stated already.,231,,
1672,0.97,12655.075,12664.451,"So we are going to go ahead and summarize this item . Council member Louis was joined by Councilmembers Morales, Strauss, and Sawant.",231,,
1673,0.97,12664.451,12669.323,Thank you very much for that discussion folks.,231,,
1674,0.97,12669.323,12672.159,We will come back.,231,,

1677,0.97,12685.172,12686.974,Did you have something for the good of the order?,231,,
1678,0.97,12686.974,12687.374,Yes.,232,,
1679,0.97,12687.374,12687.975,I'm sorry.,232,,
1680,0.97,12687.975,12697.985,Fortunately I have an unavoidable conflict starting at roughly 3:00.,232,,
1681,0.97,12697.985,12701.789,I believe I have one more item for my office which is the very last item of the agenda.,232,,
