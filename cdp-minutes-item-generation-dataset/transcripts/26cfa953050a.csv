45,0.97,497.697,505.972,"In short, we transfer the ability to build those floors that cannot be built and those help support and preserve the landmark.",15,,
46,0.97,505.972,509.709,Correct.,16,,
47,0.97,509.709,534.233,"This bill relies on existing provisions and incentive zoning chapter 23.58 A. it requires a site and maximum height to establish how much floor area receiving in the site, purchasing the development rights can transfer from the landmark or the sending site.",16,,

69,0.97,697.096,697.663,Right.,26,,
70,0.97,697.663,699.732,We relied on the zones.,26,,
71,0.97,699.732,713.679,"The chapter of code of central zoning chapter establishes procedures but then requires the ability to use those procedures be called out in the zone, that is what this does.",26,,
72,0.97,713.679,718.384,"Nc3-200 zone, that is why it is limited to that zone.",26,,
73,0.97,718.384,722.688,"Foot back to site three, I think that will help.",27,,
74,0.97,722.688,726.692,Sure.,28,,
75,0.97,726.692,733.365,"The Goldenrod color, that is the Nc3-200, Nc3P-200 zone.",28,,
76,0.97,733.365,743.042,That is the area and the Sorrento hotel is interested in using this wear that hotel is located is right there.,28,,
77,0.97,743.042,754.62,"You can currently do this, transfer development rights within the High-Rise zone which is the Brown area, that is provided for in that chapter of the code.",28,,
78,0.97,754.62,763.596,This extends it to the Nc3-200 zone.,28,,
79,0.97,763.596,769.502,"Other landmark pending, is there another pending Besides Sorrento?",29,,
80,0.97,769.502,770.536,"Not at this point, no.",30,,

89,0.97,813.078,834.266,"I'm playing a little bit of Catch-Up here, I am curious about why, why the transfer only allowed on the same block rather than somewhere throughout the area that is zoned that has similar zoning?",35,,
90,0.97,834.266,843.876,It was an attempt to define the area tightly.,36,,
91,0.97,843.876,854.286,"In other areas, it is more broadly throughout the zone, we were trying to target specifically where the development rights woodland.",36,,
92,0.97,854.286,870.002,If I'm understanding the intent or reasonably the intent would be for the rights for both the hotel itself and parking garage to be transferred to some prior --,37,,
93,0.97,870.002,878.177,"No, the rights would be transferred to the Oregon garage which would be Redeveloped.",38,,

99,0.97,882.114,894.827,"A little bit of added verification, that one is instance these other landmarks under survey become landmarks, there are others to do this as well.",43,,
100,0.97,894.827,906.839,"This bill is not for the Sorrento hotel solely, this is for this entire zone because there are a number of different parcels to meet this metric.",43,,
101,0.97,906.839,912.645,"Good question, vice chair.",43,,
102,0.97,912.645,928.594,"Consul member Nelson, I can see on Video, any questions, good to go . I guess work Jim and Lish, do we have community groups currently expressing concern or opposition to these changes?",43,,
103,0.97,928.594,958.691,"During the Sepa period, we received a letter from historic Seattle, while they are generally supportive of the approach and extending it to the zone, they have concerns redevelopment on that particular block could encourage redevelopment of one of these two apartment buildings adjacent to it in the Brown, which are also identified in historic resources surveys as potential landmarks.",44,,
104,0.97,958.691,970.669,"And then we received a letter yesterday from historic Seattle, Councilmembers received it too, Washington historic society supporting this amendment.",44,,

110,0.97,987.519,994.927,"Can you share, do you know why the initial Tdr program was excluded in this neighborhood commercial zone?",48,,
111,0.97,994.927,996.695,I don't have an answer for that.,49,,
112,0.97,996.695,1009.708,"I know we have been implementing it as we have gone through, South Lake Union, the U district and uptown as we have gone through neighborhoods, we have added.",49,,
113,0.97,1009.708,1025.858,"The usage very limited in neighborhood commercial zones, neighborhood commercial zones we only have it in the University district.",50,,

159,0.97,1402.567,1416.248,May be I will share my screen briefly so you all can navigate through what is on the agenda.,60,,
160,0.97,1416.248,1419.684,This is the memo.,60,,
161,0.97,1419.684,1434.499,"Dated February 22, yesterday, there are couple attachments to the memo, I will go through what they are and go to the status of one of them.",60,,
162,0.97,1434.499,1525.757,"Decision document we will get to in a minute to describe what it does with the decision document would grant the Rezone application with conditions that are in the document itself, that would be the petition by the full council based on recommendation of committee and also another Iteration of the environmental Covenant, we talked about this at the previous meeting, recommends Sdci environmentally critically area recorded prior to full council action so this is the latest Iteration of that and uses the Sdci template and has been Massaged for this particular purpose to require, restrict activity in the Covenant area but also allow for, there is a word I'm looking here, it is escaping me, restoration and that Covenant area with development so this has, expect to see Covenant which has legal description of the Covenant area as well as the survey showing the Covenant area which is Southeast corner.",60,,
163,0.97,1525.757,1534.9,Any questions about the materials and I will move on to refreshing your memory about the Rezone application itself.,60,,

166,0.97,1538.67,1540.605,"Thank you, Councilmember Nelson.",61,,
167,0.97,1540.605,1587.319,"Thank you, I have a question, maybe, in the memo, it indicated the North and South site shall designate 20% for Mfte, but then I'm reading on the third page of the attachment, the North and South, that is really hard to say, North and South site shall comply and have the goal of providing 20% which to me feels a little bit different than it shall provide 20%.",62,,
168,0.97,1587.319,1589.554,"Yes, thank you, that is a great question.",63,,
169,0.97,1589.554,1594.693,The challenges the applicant has not applied for Matthew's permanent development on these sites.,63,,
170,0.97,1594.693,1601.599,The applicant is proposing to redevelopment the site with three phases.,63,,
171,0.97,1601.599,1607.906,We don't know what the law will be at the time the applicant applies those development permits.,63,,
172,0.97,1607.906,1614.879,"The Mft program is a term limited program, it has to be renewed periodically by the Council.",63,,
173,0.97,1614.879,1631.396,"Current Iteration will expire December 31 2023, if they do not make application before December 21, 2023, we do not know what the law will be.",63,,
174,0.97,1631.396,1651.216,"Instead, we modified the condition, they have to comply with Mfte, whatever it looks like at the time, the applicant stated intent providing 20% of residential units on site, meeting Affordability requirements.",63,,
175,0.97,1651.216,1663.495,"That is the way we address the fact we don't know what the law will be, in the future when they do apply, we cannot allow them to lock themselves into some provisions of current Mfte program where they don't have developed proposal.",63,,
176,0.97,1663.495,1666.698,This is the proposed solution to that.,63,,
177,0.97,1666.698,1674.539,"Let me point the language, let me show my screen looking at the language Councilmember Morales flagged here.",63,,
178,0.97,1674.539,1686.551,"This is the finding and conclusion decision document as it provides language, Strikethrough condition number three, is everyone seeing that?",63,,
179,0.97,1686.551,1688.386,Mm-Hmm.,64,,
180,0.97,1688.386,1690.889,Okay.,65,,
181,0.97,1690.889,1709.941,"So, Mfte expires maybe 12 years, it will be different, the percentage will be different, whatever it looks like after 2023 is what this would need to comply with depending on what is proposed.",65,,
182,0.97,1709.941,1710.742,That is correct.,66,,
183,0.97,1710.742,1720.418,They could apply sooner for development permit for one of the phases in which case they may lock into the current program.,66,,
184,0.97,1720.418,1723.254,"Not knowing when they will apply, this is the language to address that.",66,,
185,0.97,1723.254,1724.322,"Okay, thank you.",67,,
186,0.97,1724.322,1728.727,Mm-Hmm.,68,,
187,0.97,1728.727,1734.032,"Councilmember, take it away.",69,,
188,0.97,1734.032,1738.67,"Thank you, chair Strauss.",70,,
189,0.97,1738.67,1753.318,"Ketil, following up on this question about affordable housing, Sdci memo attached to hearing Examiner's ruling indicates there are 148 housing units currently that are below market.",70,,
190,0.97,1753.318,1756.921,"Yeah, about 70% or 90% AMI.",71,,
191,0.97,1756.921,1760.492,Okay.,72,,
192,0.97,1760.492,1774.606,We are seeing here they will have the goal of providing 20% of housing units that meet Affordability requirements with Mfte.,72,,
193,0.97,1774.606,1778.743,"And what with the 20% be, isn't that only 100 units?",72,,
194,0.97,1778.743,1783.648,"No, again, we don't know exactly what future development proposals may look like.",73,,
195,0.97,1783.648,1807.405,"We do know the general thinking, a lot of this I think is looking at 10, the applicant Rezone analysis, we NOTE future development is likely going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 1000 units, that is what they are imagining will happen over the course of many years of Redeveloping the sites.",73,,
196,0.97,1807.405,1810.008,There are a couple of Affordability components.,73,,
197,0.97,1810.008,1829.894,"One is compliance with the requirements of Mha, assuming it is 1000 units under M1 requirement for this particular part of town, the applicant would be required to provide 9% of units.",73,,
198,0.97,1829.894,1831.129,"That is about 100, 90.",74,,
199,0.97,1831.129,1832.497,That is close.,75,,
200,0.97,1832.497,1845.276,"The remaining of the affordable units would come from Mfte, another 200 potentially depending on what the program requirements are at the time of the application submitted.",75,,
201,0.97,1845.276,1851.749,"The Mha requirement would be what, 60% AMI?",76,,
202,0.97,1851.749,1853.585,"Yeah, 60% AMI.",77,,
203,0.97,1853.585,1881.88,"And Mfte is different AMI based on unit sizes and such, that natural occurring affordable housing, like you said, 70 to 90% AMI, Mha would be 60% plus the Mft unit which would be a range of, I can't member, 70 to 90% AMI for Mft.",78,,
204,0.97,1881.88,1888.853,"And lower, it depends on the unit sizes and number of the dreams.",79,,
205,0.97,1888.853,1903.401,"I'm trying to figure out what the Trade-Off is for low income housing because, I appreciate the level of detail with this analysis so we can see it can be equivalent or better potentially than what it is today.",80,,
206,0.97,1903.401,1904.535,Yeah.,81,,
207,0.97,1904.535,1908.473,It all depends on how many units are ultimately developed.,81,,
208,0.97,1908.473,1922.153,"At least according to the applicant's' current plans, somewhat over 1000, I think 1100 is in the record, indicating what their intent is for redevelopment in the future.",81,,
209,0.97,1922.153,1926.224,"If that holds, there would be more affordable units on site in the future than there currently are.",81,,
210,0.97,1926.224,1930.361,Thank you.,82,,
211,0.97,1935.933,1937.335,"I love those fine points, Ketil.",83,,
212,0.97,1937.335,1940.204,No problem.,84,,
213,0.97,1940.204,1949.914,"The interest and refreshing your memory and folks following along out in the public, I will remind folks a little bit about the application, the map of where it is.",84,,
214,0.97,1949.914,1962.694,"Proposed Rezone is on the Northgate urban center, proposal to Rezone the site from Mr M1, combined site is about five acres.",84,,

216,0.97,1969.634,1976.674,Sdci issued Sepa determination and initially approved the application in September.,84,,
217,0.97,1976.674,1981.913,There was Ketil appeal which was dismissed with Examiners in October.,84,,
