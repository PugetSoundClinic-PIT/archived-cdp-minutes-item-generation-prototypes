92,0.97,547.68,555.988,"Before passing this bill, please, number one, limit extending its provisions to three months, and two, require they provide a list of additional projects that would now be allowed to remain in Apr along with reasons.",21,,

362,0.97,1906.638,1919.183,"With regard to the eight positions, several Department of human resources director has determined the work performed by these eight positions no longer be the criteria for civil service exemption.",113,,
363,0.97,1919.183,1920.852,He recommends returning the positions to civil service.,113,,
364,0.97,1920.852,1943.308,"October 2 memo drafted by analyst the table of the positions by way of summary these positions are in various departments putting the office of planning and community development, Seattle office for civil rights, education and early learning, finance, arts and culture, Department of transportation and the community Commission.",113,,
365,0.97,1943.308,1948.112,Of the eight positions only two at Sdot and one at Opcd are currently filled.,113,,
366,0.97,1948.112,1957.121,The remaining positions are vacant.,113,,
367,0.97,1957.121,1975.606,"The impact of these positions is that they are returned to the civil service system which means the employees in these positions now or in the future will be afforded a range of additional job protection including Merit-Based hiring, Probationary periods of employment, opportunity to direct performance issues, and cause of termination rather than at will employment.",113,,
368,0.97,1975.606,1983.748,The additional rules are detailed in the October 2 memorandum.,113,,
369,0.97,1983.748,1986.05,The second component of this bill relates to the legislative Department.,113,,
370,0.97,1986.05,1998.029,This legislation ACCEPTS the director's recommendation to create a new job title of manager of legislative.,113,,
371,0.97,1998.029,2006.971,This new job title would Delineate responsibilities among professional and managerial staff the currently have the same title of strategic advisor and it creates an opportunity for career progression and succession planning within the cultural Council central staff.,113,,
372,0.97,2006.971,2013.01,In conclusion this is cause neutral.,113,,
373,0.97,2013.01,2019.684,Executive is indicated returning this to the civil service system would not increase cost because it does mean they would remain at the same pay rate after the change.,113,,
374,0.97,2019.684,2030.862,In other words the legislation changes the job protections for these positions but does not modify the existing ranges of available pay for the eight positions I described.,113,,
375,0.97,2030.862,2042.774,With regard to the new job title in the legislative Department to pay and for that is parallel to that of strategic advisor in the legislative Department.,113,,
376,0.97,2042.774,2045.376,This does not modify the pay band available for this job title creation.,113,,
377,0.97,2045.376,2056.621,Any additional cost for this job title canon will be absorbed by the legislative Department existing budget authority and would not require new appropriation of funds moving forward.,113,,
378,0.97,2056.621,2062.627,I am happy to hear any additional comments or take any questions on the bill.,113,,

403,0.97,2116.347,2133.064,"An ordinance relating to land use review decision and meeting procedures; temporarily modifying and suspending procedures in titles 23 and 25 of the Seattle municipal code and amending chapters 23.41, 23.49, 23.66, 23.79, 25.12, 25.16, 25.20, 25.21, 25.22, 25.24, and 25.30 of the Seattle municipal code.",134,,
404,0.97,2133.064,2140.204,The committee recommends the city council passed the amended Council bill divided report.,134,,
405,0.97,2140.204,2140.805,Thank you.,135,,
406,0.97,2140.805,2148.513,This legislation extends provisions that allow for virtual design review and landmark ward meetings to continue until the end of Covid- 19 emergency.,135,,
407,0.97,2148.513,2165.73,You will recall in April we adopted emergency legislation in response to the Covid-19 emergency which allowed projects that would originally go to design review boards to instead be considered for administrative design review which is conducted by staff.,135,,
408,0.97,2165.73,2176.307,"When we passed that legislation, council made clear we expected the Department neighborhoods to start virtual design meetings of the design review and landmark sport a is possible.",135,,
409,0.97,2176.307,2186.918,Sdci Department of neighborhoods worked hard to move these complex meetings to virtual format which included the need for additional staff.,135,,
410,0.97,2186.918,2189.453,These meetings are now up and running and are going well.,135,,
411,0.97,2189.453,2194.625,This legislation allows for those virtual meetings to continue for the duration of Covid-19.,135,,
412,0.97,2194.625,2200.631,And automatically Sunsets two months after the emergency ends to allow time to ramp up in person meetings again.,135,,
413,0.97,2200.631,2212.243,"Is the original legislation required, new projects except for affordable housing are now going through full design review board processes again.",135,,
414,0.97,2212.243,2215.379,Because virtual meetings have begun.,135,,
415,0.97,2215.379,2219.183,This legislation does not propose to change that.,135,,
416,0.97,2219.183,2230.194,The legislation does allow for limited number of projects that already started the administrative design review process to stay in the administrative design review process through the end of this year.,135,,
417,0.97,2230.194,2243.975,Specifically projects that can stay through December if the project has completed the early design guidance process or if Sdci cannot provide a virtual meeting before the ordinance takes effect.,135,,
418,0.97,2243.975,2254.719,"Of the 67 projects opted into administrative design review through the emergency ordinance, there are currently just 15 who qualify for the end of this year.",135,,
419,0.97,2254.719,2266.13,Administrative design review still includes opportunity for public input akin to full design review even though it is not a full design review.,135,,
420,0.97,2266.13,2276.24,"As I mentioned at Council briefing this morning, I did consider other to bring an amendment that would've shortened this Timeline of this legislation to six months from now.",135,,
421,0.97,2276.24,2281.045,For us to be able to consider modifications to be made or aspects of the bill working well and should be made permanent.,135,,
422,0.97,2281.045,2296.16,I am not bringing that amendment for this afternoon because it is better policy to simply extend these temporary provisions for the duration of the emergency.,135,,
423,0.97,2296.16,2304.168,Rather we will do the work between now and then to understand which of these changes are working well so that at the end of the Covid emergency we are ready to make changes for the new environment.,135,,
424,0.97,2304.168,2326.657,As well we retain the opportunity to make permanent or make modification before the Covid emergency is over on a separate track as to not Conflate this emergency integrate changes from the permanent or ongoing changes needed.,135,,
425,0.97,2326.657,2331.362,"Finally, I have heard from some residents who share their concerns about the legislation and some of whom we heard in public comment today.",135,,
426,0.97,2331.362,2335.966,My staff or I have met with many repeatedly in the recent weeks and we appreciate the conversations.,135,,
427,0.97,2335.966,2340.204,It enabled us to understand concerns more in depth.,135,,
428,0.97,2340.204,2350.881,We even brought an amendment to shorten the original duration of this legislation directly respond to the issues that she raised.,135,,
429,0.97,2350.881,2366.03,"It was originally proposed to be six months, the extension of this legislation would be in effect six months past the end of the Covid emergency and we have reduced that to two months past the Covid emergency.",135,,
430,0.97,2366.03,2373.938,"I've heard from central staff it takes about three months for us, due to public requirements and other Land-Use code requirements for us to make needed changes.",135,,
431,0.97,2373.938,2385.716,That is why we will get working before the Covid emergency is over so when the Covid civil emergency is ended we will be ready to take the next step.,135,,
432,0.97,2385.716,2396.36,"This policy does not allow new projects past design review, it ensures the process continues smoothly and safely during these extra Neri times.",135,,
433,0.97,2396.36,2400.831,This bill is an extension of the bill passed in April.,135,,
434,0.97,2400.831,2402.233,I encourage your support.,135,,
435,0.97,2402.233,2404.635,"Thank you colleagues, thank you Council President.",135,,
436,0.97,2404.635,2408.873,Thank you Councilmember Strauss for that report.,136,,
437,0.97,2408.873,2413.344,Farther any additional comments on the bill?,136,,
438,0.97,2413.344,2415.179,"Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",136,,
439,0.97,2415.179,2425.589,Thank you very much.,137,,
440,0.97,2427.925,2431.295,"Councilmember Strauss, I want to say thank you for your leadership Stewarding us through this process.",137,,
441,0.97,2431.295,2432.062,I think it's really important.,137,,
442,0.97,2432.062,2433.697,I'm very excited to vote for this.,137,,
443,0.97,2433.697,2435.266,I understand it's a small but important measure.,137,,
444,0.97,2435.266,2445.91,"I don't want to Oversell its impact or the significance because it is more of a process in nature, making sure the functions of court government can continue during this crisis.",137,,
445,0.97,2445.91,2454.985,"I wasn't planning to speak but I do think it's important to clarify for the record, there is nothing this Council is doing that is trying to use Covid as an excuse to change policy.",137,,
446,0.97,2454.985,2466.53,In fact what we are doing is being responsible stewards of the public's health by making sure Sissies can continue and to do so in a way that protects the very vulnerable in our community and frankly all of us.,137,,
447,0.97,2466.53,2477.842,"Covid has no bounds, it will infect people whether they are young or old, it happens to be those who are elderly and with underlying health conditions that are more susceptible to death.",137,,
448,0.97,2477.842,2495.226,"So while we continue to see increases in the number of Covid cases in our city and our region, we also take pride as a Seattle times as noted, that Seattle's among the largest cities that has been slower, the slowest rate of infection among this population.",137,,
449,0.97,2495.226,2506.237,We have taken very important measures led by public health data that is intended to both slow transmission and also keep our population healthy.,137,,
450,0.97,2506.237,2545.175,"As we think about who are the individuals who would more likely be in a situation to become exposed, it would be those inside a closed room for long periods of time making the opportunity for this to participate electronically is the right thing to do for public health and also recognizes that when we force people to go back to In-Person meetings, sooner than they should be, we will effectively be screening out those who have underlying health conditions and those who may be elderly because they are not going to be able to participate in an in person room.",137,,
451,0.97,2545.175,2548.612,This is a smart thing for us to do.,137,,
452,0.97,2548.612,2550.714,It is sound public health policy we are following.,137,,
453,0.97,2550.714,2558.188,It allows for our city to continue to govern in a thoughtful way that is cognizant of the public health.,137,,
454,0.97,2558.188,2574.638,"So, I do take issue with any sort of accusation that this is being done for any other policy rationale other than trying to protect the public health and make sure the city government core functions can continue.",137,,
455,0.97,2574.638,2591.956,This is why Seattle is leading the nation in strong public health policies and helping to slow the spread of transmission . We cannot continue to keep up those Statistics that were reported by the Seattle times if we rush to reopen or try to get back to normal.,137,,
456,0.97,2591.956,2593.991,There is no getting back to normal.,137,,
457,0.97,2593.991,2601.131,I appreciate Councilmember Strauss's sponsor of this legislation recognizing we have to continually update our policy and practices.,137,,
458,0.97,2601.131,2606.37,We have built in time to do so.,137,,
459,0.97,2606.37,2611.175,"But we must, must center policy both on public health and protecting the most mobile in our city.",137,,
460,0.97,2611.175,2612.042,That's what this policy does.,137,,
461,0.97,2612.042,2616.08,"Again, it's a small procedural change to make sure we can move forward.",137,,
462,0.97,2616.08,2618.582,I thought I needed to speak up and correct the record.,137,,
463,0.97,2618.582,2620.651,Thank you Councilmember Mosqueda.,138,,
464,0.97,2620.651,2636.6,"Thank you, Madam chair, I want to take time to think Councilember Strauss for navigating an issue that has been very difficult and that none of us anticipated was going to come up in 2020.",139,,
465,0.97,2636.6,2648.579,"Really, changing the paradigm of how we do this essential process of community in Golan involvement in that there can be continuity technology to make it happen.",139,,
466,0.97,2648.579,2670.734,And that we can stand up a system like this and I appreciate the opportunity to collaborate with Councilmember Strauss on a couple of changes that Councilmember Strauss made in his introductory remarks on the bill regarding the Timeline post Covid that I know are important to a lot of constituents in district 7. and appreciate that was unincorporated in committee.,139,,
467,0.97,2670.734,2694.224,I know there has been a lot of concern in the community on both sides with this legislation since the spring as an opportunity to sort of Litigate the merits of design review and to try to fight that battle in the context of this basically emergency legislation.,139,,
468,0.97,2694.224,2697.194,It certainly was in the spring and it is now more of a normal ordinance.,139,,
469,0.97,2697.194,2699.096,But still collecting an emergency situation.,139,,
470,0.97,2699.096,2705.235,And I would just say that I am sure that is a conversation and discussion that will come in time.,139,,
471,0.97,2705.235,2718.015,But we need to make sure that the essential functions of government can continue in times of crisis and that they be adapted to reflect the public health situation.,139,,
472,0.97,2718.015,2730.694,"As Councilmember Mosqueda said, make sure we are giving everyone the space to dissipate in these processes in a Safeway.",139,,
473,0.97,2730.694,2733.964,"I do want to say, it really is due to the nature of the emergency.",139,,
474,0.97,2733.964,2739.703,I don't think anyone on this Council is thrilled that a lot of the work of the city has to be done remotely right now.,139,,
475,0.97,2739.703,2747.711,"But to protect those that we love and those were vulnerable in the community, this is really an essential thing to do.",139,,
476,0.97,2747.711,2755.419,And I also want to thank Sdci for being able to stand up a pretty impressive system to do this.,139,,
477,0.97,2755.419,2770.734,"Is Council members Strauss stressed, the ADR administrative design review board for market rate projects has 15 projects already invested in summer in late spring.",139,,
478,0.97,2770.734,2784.248,"That will expire at the end of the year, going into 2021 we should be on and all virtual footing for these projects, except for the projects that otherwise have exemption.",139,,
479,0.97,2784.248,2786.683,I look forward to voting for this legislation today.,139,,
480,0.97,2786.683,2796.26,No one is excited that a lot of these processes that typically involve in person outreach have to be put on a virtual footing.,139,,
481,0.97,2796.26,2803.967,But it really is in the best interest of best practices in public health to do it this way.,139,,
482,0.97,2803.967,2814.344,"And again, I just appreciate Sdci and Councilmember Strauss's leadership in that complicated situation and doing it quite well.",139,,
483,0.97,2814.344,2815.078,I appreciate it.,139,,
484,0.97,2815.078,2815.879,Thank you.,139,,
485,0.97,2815.879,2820.184,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,140,,
486,0.97,2820.184,2824.655,"Thank you, Council President.",141,,
487,0.97,2824.655,2832.863,Kudos to Councilmember Strauss for navigating this in the amendment to shorten the Timeframe.,141,,
488,0.97,2832.863,2837.267,The legislation seem to do a couple different things.,141,,
489,0.97,2837.267,2848.812,I definitely appreciate rationale for continuing to exempt certain affordable housing projects for both design review and administrative design review.,141,,
490,0.97,2848.812,2855.152,Most affordable housing projects receive city money and a required to do a separate community engagement process anyway.,141,,
491,0.97,2855.152,2860.424,"For me it's about if we can maximize public input, community engagement, I am in favor of that.",141,,
492,0.97,2860.424,2866.93,I am glad Sdci has stood up the virtual design review process.,141,,
493,0.97,2866.93,2880.744,"My concern is this bill would, those 15 projects, we get to keep the administrative design review benefit for themselves.",141,,
494,0.97,2880.744,2882.412,They are all for profit market rate projects.,141,,
495,0.97,2882.412,2891.154,"I just think they should have to go back to the regular design review since they can do it virtually, safely Online and provide additional input.",141,,
496,0.97,2891.154,2893.924,Consistent with my committee vote I will be voting no on this legislation.,141,,
497,0.97,2893.924,2894.358,Thank you.,141,,
498,0.97,2894.358,2896.627,Thank you.,142,,
499,0.97,2896.627,2918.282,I just want to speak a little bit to some of the issues that have been raised about the question of whether or not the Council is sort of using the state of emergency to make changes to important policies and procedures for public input.,143,,
500,0.97,2918.282,2943.707,"Given that I voted against this legislation back and I believe it was April, I want to clarify for the record, that the reason I did so in April was because we had, we were operating under a different set of rules, and of course there was different interpretations of those rules under the types of legislation that we were permitted to be acting on.",143,,
501,0.97,2943.707,2945.776,It seems like ancient history now.,143,,
502,0.97,2945.776,2953.216,But we were limited to taking action on emergency legislation for the governor and the AG.,143,,
503,0.97,2953.216,2960.991,I thought at the time a portion of this ordinance did not fit into that rubric.,143,,
504,0.97,2960.991,2962.459,That is not the case any longer.,143,,
505,0.97,2962.459,2966.296,For that reason I feel comfortable voting in support of this legislation.,143,,
506,0.97,2966.296,2967.097,Thank you.,143,,
507,0.97,2967.097,2978.875,"Thank you for reminding us that legislative history, it was only in April, but you are right, it feels like 1 million years ago already.",144,,
508,0.97,2978.875,2995.926,And an excellent point that the proclamation limits exemptions related to the open public meetings act has been pretty drastically modified to allow us to consider things not related to bid anymore.,144,,
509,0.97,2995.926,3003.667,I appreciate the reminder around that . any other comments on this bill?,144,,

511,0.97,3012.476,3015.278,Thank you.,145,,
512,0.97,3015.278,3033.296,"Just to also echo the words of Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Mosqueda, that this is not a way to use the Covid emergency to make changes to legislation, there have been a number of aspects of this legislation that have done very well in community.",145,,
513,0.97,3033.296,3035.599,Virtual design is one of them.,145,,
514,0.97,3035.599,3045.075,One of the things I wanted to begin looking at is if we could make a combination of in person and virtual design review.,145,,
515,0.97,3045.075,3059.89,"Because of requirements that in person design review meetings occur in and near the community and project they are reviewing, it does make it difficult to Cohabitate virtual and in person design review meetings.",145,,
516,0.97,3059.89,3070.634,Because a lot of the rooms they are held in are not set up for the technology that we need to use virtual design review.,145,,
517,0.97,3070.634,3097.127,"Again, separating permanent changes from this temporary, from this extension of emergency and temporary exchanges demonstrates we are not slipping anything through using this emergency as a cover, rather we are making important process changes that protect public health and continue the direction we are heading with a number of Covid cases we have in our community.",145,,
518,0.97,3097.127,3105.268,"So, I look forward to reviewing the positives and the drawbacks that this emergency and legislation has created.",145,,
519,0.97,3105.268,3109.272,And making further changes to our design review process in the future.,145,,
520,0.97,3109.272,3110.474,Thank you.,145,,

551,0.97,3213.71,3225.989,The good news is revenue from selling our excess energy is up this year and the utility forecast at the current rate surcharge are likely to be reduced or removed in 2021.,167,,
552,0.97,3225.989,3235.799,So along with no general rate increase in 2021 that means our customers will likely experience further rate relief in 2021.,167,,

613,0.97,3459.889,3472.836,Seattle needs to continue the hard work to address climate change and owning Seattle city light enables us to expand opportunities to use clean hydroelectric power to the carbon eyes our economy.,210,,

615,0.97,3474.637,3490.954,Adopting the Electrification strategic investment plan will build upon the collaboration between our executive and legislative branches of government which includes the climate know we recently passed to consider all new legislation through the lens of climate change.,210,,
616,0.97,3490.954,3503.199,Specifically the Council bill AMENDS Seattle misses municipal cold code allowing transportation let's vacation.,210,,
617,0.97,3503.199,3518.581,This is similar to the incentives that Seattle city light uses to provide or to encourage customers to make customers investments in their homes and commercial properties.,210,,

626,0.97,3546.576,3556.119,My comments are regarding this agenda item and also the following one because the legislation in the two items is connected.,212,,
627,0.97,3556.119,3576.039,This bill and the resolution will be voting on next are the legislation that is legally required by the state before Seattle city light can provide financial incentives to switch from vehicles that burn gas and diesel to electric vehicles that can run on the Hydropower.,212,,
628,0.97,3576.039,3596.726,"When you compare Seattle city light, are publicly owned and operated utility to Puget sound energy, the private For-Profit utility that SELLS electricity generated by burning natural gas in the neighboring cities, it is a very clear example of why public investment for the green NW deal are essential to address climate change.",212,,
629,0.97,3596.726,3607.136,Before profit capitalist market will not solve the existing crisis of climate catastrophe.,212,,
630,0.97,3607.136,3614.277,City light generates electricity with Hydropower including from generators built as part of our new deal in the 1930s.,212,,
631,0.97,3614.277,3615.778,We need that scale of investment again.,212,,
632,0.97,3615.778,3620.75,"In recent years city light has had many excellent smoke scale conservation programs, L.E.D.",212,,
633,0.97,3620.75,3630.626,Light bulbs have been affordable in Seattle largely because they had a light city light helps them from the store.,212,,
634,0.97,3630.626,3645.742,"City light helps us know where we are leaking energy, and helps city owners, and protect habitat land in Eastern Washington.",212,,
635,0.97,3646.009,3650.413,In recent years city light has pushed the board of Seattle to Electrify one terminal at a time.,212,,
636,0.97,3650.413,3659.389,"And, has built 16 electric charging stations it owns and operates in Seattle today with four more on the way.",212,,
637,0.97,3659.389,3667.63,All of this has been possible because city light and these bills for transportation Electrification continue that work.,212,,
638,0.97,3667.63,3682.311,Parts of these bills that I am most excited about are the transitions of Metro buses to electricity and electrifying.,212,,
639,0.97,3682.311,3684.313,Those are things city light has been working on.,212,,
640,0.97,3684.313,3695.925,I am glad they are continued in these bills I really wanted to congratulate all the individuals and organizations in the environmental and climate justice community who have been pushing on all of these for years.,212,,
641,0.97,3695.925,3712.341,"Am disappointed, however, that the Mayor's office is not invested in more real resources in transportation Electrification in Seattle.",212,,
642,0.97,3712.341,3712.975,Rather than just plans.,212,,
643,0.97,3712.975,3718.981,These documents are only a general plan and the next step from here would be to write an implementation plan and after that there could be new investments.,212,,
644,0.97,3718.981,3734.497,"In fact, in the Mayor's budget she specifically calls out the small city light funds dedicated to Electrification but completely Glosses over the fact that the budget lines that include transportation Electrification have actually been significantly reduced since last year in her budget.",212,,
645,0.97,3734.497,3740.703,My office has asked city council central staff to look into this in more detail because there are parts of the budget line unrelated to programs.,212,,
646,0.97,3740.703,3745.675,"So, we will have more to talk about at the time.",212,,
647,0.97,3745.675,3757.42,"Some of it is the funding allocated to green new deal programs that have on balance been cut, not increased, by the Mayor in the new proposed budget.",212,,
648,0.97,3757.42,3774.137,"I will be voting yes on the two bills, they are extremely thorough and competent in the programs implemented are effective and I also want to thank them for engaging with my office and answering the questions we had this legislation.",212,,
649,0.97,3774.137,3780.009,I just wanted to register my disappointment that there is not more real investment by the Mayor and actually implementing the plan.,212,,
