75,0.97,551.217,555.855,This will continue to happen if we allow the current system to continue.,8,,
76,0.97,555.855,566.332,"As community members we must create accountability system that helps us feel safe, an accountability system that is accountable to us.",8,,

100,0.97,705.938,712.711,I have had to deal with the oppressive criminal legal system and effects were long lasting.,12,,
101,0.97,712.711,724.99,This includes city attorneys office diverting money from Defunding SPD toward expansion of city attorneys office to% conduct risk assessments violates spirit of the Defund movement.,12,,

106,0.97,755.121,760.693,"That mother needed services, needed a system that relies on services over Incarceration.",12,,

126,0.97,884.35,887.353,The citizens deserve opportunity to have access to the tools.,14,,
127,0.97,887.353,899.198,Walking in the streets of Seattle it is clear mental health and addiction is an issue and society needs to do better at helping the people who live here regardless of income or identity.,14,,
128,0.97,899.198,907.072,Enact this ordinance and allow alternative solutions to become accessible reality for those who need it most.,14,,

135,0.97,940.606,946.845,Decriminalization means Opioid addicts can seek effective means of over coming addiction when other methods failed them.,16,,
136,0.97,946.845,955.187,It means getting rid of outdated drug laws that have only proven to fill jails.,16,,
137,0.97,955.187,963.395,Not Decriminalizing is telling veterans we are not interested in exploring options and would prefer to throw them in jail.,16,,
138,0.97,963.395,974.239,It means folks with terminal illnesses that want to soothe their pain have to risk safety by buying drugs off the street and risking address.,16,,
139,0.97,974.239,987.353,We can't provide educational resources and community outreach to folks failed by Antidepressants and pharmaceuticals who want to better themselves.,16,,

151,0.97,1050.816,1052.551,"Serenity, self love replaced anxiety.",18,,

163,0.97,1109.041,1110.142,Good morning everyone.,20,,
164,0.97,1110.142,1111.81,My name is Penny.,20,,
165,0.97,1111.81,1118.083,I am a white homeowner in district 6. I am calling in response to the strategic plan being presented today.,20,,
166,0.97,1118.083,1129.628,I stand with the goal of shrinking criminal legal system and building up community capacity for responding to crisis and human needs as the alternative.,20,,
167,0.97,1129.628,1136.034,I am concerned about expansion of the city attorneys office to conduct risk assessments.,20,,
168,0.97,1136.034,1144.243,Money diverted from policing to office of the city attorney keeps us invested in huge Footprint of the criminal legal system.,20,,
169,0.97,1144.243,1156.355,I appreciate direction of intercept zero with support of Participatory budgeting as an example of alternative that doesn't require contact with the criminal legal system.,20,,
170,0.97,1156.355,1161.326,Unfortunately the framework over all Prioritizes systems need rather than needs of community members.,20,,
171,0.97,1161.326,1165.631,I speak for keeping emphasis on basic human needs and dignity.,20,,
172,0.97,1165.631,1181.58,Using terms like crime reduction and preventing Recidivism to easily slide into the thinking that these are primary motives for offering services rather than centering basic dignity of humans and need for thriving community.,20,,
173,0.97,1181.58,1190.722,This Replicates logic of the system's Criminalized Pathologized impacted individual before they are deemed deserving of services.,20,,
174,0.97,1190.722,1198.263,"Services should be accessible because they are needed for people to survive heal and thrive, not out of need to Surveil and monitor.",20,,
175,0.97,1198.263,1205.904,We need more up stream solutions that reflect the responsibility in caring for well being of poor vulnerable communities.,20,,
176,0.97,1205.904,1227.559,I urge you to keep working to further reduce Footprint of the criminal legal system in all its forms and ways it Harmfully impacts people's lives who are disproportionately black indigenous and people of color.,20,,
177,0.97,1227.559,1227.993,Thank you.,20,,

179,0.97,1239.204,1247.512,Good morning Seattle city council.,22,,
180,0.97,1247.512,1263.028,I am starting by saying recommendations in the report you will do today I think are good and are in alignment with the community that a few years ago advocated from one of the city's jail contracts.,22,,
181,0.97,1263.028,1284.816,That being said part of advocacy was to see Footprint of the criminal legal system be strong and be able to address ways in which the system Harms and impacts lives especially black indigenous people of color queer and Trans and disabled community members.,22,,
182,0.97,1284.816,1293.992,The system includes city attorneys office and diverting money toward expansion of the attorneys office to conduct risk assessment violates the spirit of our movement.,22,,
183,0.97,1293.992,1298.03,We are advocating that you shrink the size.,22,,
184,0.97,1298.03,1312.144,Nature of misdemeanor offenses are marry majority crimes of poverty and solution is to increase access to human rights and livelihoods not to reinforce the system that's made people vulnerable.,22,,
185,0.97,1312.144,1319.584,"90% of Misdemeanors, folks being Decriminalized as Misdemeanors are considered indigent.",22,,
186,0.97,1319.584,1323.422,That really will decrease number of people in the criminal legal system.,22,,
187,0.97,1323.422,1338.837,I hope at some point we get to hear from the community members that were part of the task force because I know they have their own recommendations and hope they have the opportunity and same format to share their thoughts and wisdom with the Council.,22,,
188,0.97,1338.837,1339.371,Thank you.,22,,
189,0.97,1339.371,1341.273,Thank you.,23,,
190,0.97,1341.273,1351.616,Next is La Tonya severe followed by Conner waters.,23,,
191,0.97,1351.616,1352.684,Good morning.,24,,
192,0.97,1352.684,1357.456,I am a 39-year-old black queer Nonbinary person renting in D2.,24,,
193,0.97,1357.456,1369.935,I am also Colead of the black brilliance research project which worked with over 100 community researchers who were primarily black and Brown.,24,,
194,0.97,1369.935,1373.138,This included voices of thousands of community members budgeting process.,24,,
195,0.97,1373.138,1379.244,I am calling to respond to the criminal legal system strategic plan being presented today.,24,,
196,0.97,1379.244,1393.992,I appreciate seeing the black brilliance research project and Participatory budgeting Megiaed investing more money into city attorneys office is at odds with recommendations coming out of the research.,24,,
197,0.97,1393.992,1406.071,Council should be reducing Footprint of the criminal punishment system and ways it is Harmfully Impacting peoples lives disproportionately.,24,,
198,0.97,1406.071,1409.775,Definite based models like trauma informed lens.,24,,
199,0.97,1409.775,1415.747,We need genuine trauma formed interventions that support communities to thrive.,24,,
200,0.97,1415.747,1421.019,Trauma informed approach assumes nobody is inherently violent or abusive.,24,,
201,0.97,1421.019,1427.659,We have all been traumatized by our surroundings and learn to cope in whatever ways we could.,24,,
202,0.97,1427.659,1436.401,Some of the trauma responses have developed into patterns of behavior that may cause further harm to others around us.,24,,
203,0.97,1436.401,1453.785,Being trauma informed means we look at each person's struggles through a trauma lens which is distinct from Judgmental punitive models that considers harmful actions of individuals at the failures of character that need to be corrected with punishment.,24,,
204,0.97,1453.785,1469.534,From a public health perspective Metrics utilized by risk needs response model are deficit based.,24,,
205,0.97,1469.534,1486.518,"Focusing on prior interactions, lacks trauma informed lens, are not strength or asset based criteria which recognize, draw from, strengthen an individual's resources and capacity.",24,,
206,0.97,1486.518,1487.786,Thank you.,25,,
207,0.97,1487.786,1495.927,Next is Conner waters followed by Valerie Shoret.,25,,

211,0.97,1516.181,1527.425,As part of the Decriminalize nature Seattle group I am hoping you will sign the letter to the task force in support of ordinance to Decriminalize Psychedelics in Seattle.,26,,
212,0.97,1527.425,1533.999,I work with patients who have anxiety and depression and I have experienced both myself.,26,,
213,0.97,1533.999,1545.844,I know Anecdotally for my patients and my life experience that the therapies can produce a lift mood used in a reasonable manner and safe environment.,26,,
214,0.97,1545.844,1559.391,I know from medical training this has grounding in research around both anxiety and depression as well as end of life care.,26,,
215,0.97,1559.391,1568.233,A notable study found two Dosing sessions paired with series of psychotherapy improved significant measures in depression scores.,26,,
216,0.97,1568.233,1580.578,I know from my experience in Healthcare and emergency medicine that Seattle suffers from suicide rates far above others in U.S.A.,26,,
217,0.97,1580.578,1582.147,Seasonal defective disorder.,26,,
218,0.97,1582.147,1591.056,I speculate access to Psychedelic medicine without fear of legal repercussions could empower citizens to be Proactive in Healthcare.,26,,
219,0.97,1591.056,1599.03,Increasing number of Clinicians are how to guide patients on safe use and this could revolutionize outcomes in mental Healthcare.,26,,
220,0.97,1599.03,1609.607,Make a bold affirming statement for the health of constituents by supporting Decriminalization of Psychedelics in Seattle.,26,,
221,0.97,1609.607,1611.977,Reduces harm and opens new options for Healthcare.,26,,
222,0.97,1611.977,1614.846,Thank you for your time.,26,,
223,0.97,1614.846,1616.314,Thank you.,27,,

225,0.97,1629.894,1630.762,Hi.,28,,
226,0.97,1630.762,1631.096,Good morning.,28,,
227,0.97,1631.096,1646.044,I live in district 2. I will be interested to hear discussion about SPD and crisis response but I suspect it will omit mention of the many in mental health crisis killed by SPD.,28,,
228,0.97,1646.044,1661.292,"Shooting of Derek Hayden on the water front in February is one example of a crisis incident that could have been handled differently and if it had been, it would have saved a life.",28,,
229,0.97,1661.292,1674.706,"The Powerpoint attached to today's Hangen today, Powerpoint that will accompany today's seems Aspirational and not based on reality of what is happening when police are called to respond to people in crisis.",28,,
230,0.97,1674.706,1678.343,To be honest that Disconnect makes me feel sick.,28,,
231,0.97,1678.343,1690.622,I know from experience that our current system of crisis response to people in mental health crisis is woefully inadequate and increases harm.,28,,
232,0.97,1690.622,1697.295,That's my family experience and thinking about it has really made me feel ill.,28,,
233,0.97,1697.295,1709.274,To understand what's been happening when SPD encounters people in crisis we need real police accountability to shine a light on the practice.,28,,
234,0.97,1709.274,1716.214,Go to Seattlestop.Org for more information about how we can make that happen.,28,,
235,0.97,1716.214,1717.248,Thank you.,29,,
236,0.97,1717.248,1724.456,Next bill Roberts is showing as not present.,29,,
237,0.97,1724.456,1729.227,We'll go to Elaina lesson.,29,,
238,0.97,1729.227,1729.527,Hello.,30,,
239,0.97,1729.527,1738.403,I am calling in to address the presentation about the crisis response but also specifically to address Seattle fire Department police chief.,30,,
240,0.97,1738.403,1742.073,I would like to know where are your text messages?,30,,
241,0.97,1742.073,1759.057,You were one of the several including Seattle police chief and how can we trust anything you say in a meeting like this when you repeatedly have shown to Delete text in his some of the most critical moments.,30,,
242,0.97,1759.057,1771.035,In addition I would like to say that the Seattle fire Department is incredibly complacent with Seattle police Department's bad response for mental health issues.,30,,
243,0.97,1771.035,1786.317,"Amount of times declined to respond to someone experiencing, someone unconscious or someone experiencing drug issue has directly led to part of the reason people don't trust calling 911.",30,,
244,0.97,1786.317,1790.688,It's really critical and leads to death of people.,30,,
245,0.97,1790.688,1805.336,I would like to stand in solidarity for everyone calling about the critical criminal legal system plan and transferring money to Seattle city attorneys office and with Defund Seattle.,30,,
246,0.97,1805.336,1805.637,Thank you.,30,,
247,0.97,1805.637,1805.97,Thank you.,31,,
248,0.97,1805.97,1821.152,Our last Speaker who is indicating as present is a person who is signed in as Merriam with no last name.,31,,
249,0.97,1821.152,1826.157,Merriam.,31,,
250,0.97,1826.157,1826.391,Hi.,32,,
251,0.97,1826.391,1828.893,I am a resident of district 6.,32,,
252,0.97,1828.893,1840.338,I am calling to urge you to reduce of SPD not only in our city in general but specifically when approaching community members in crisis.,32,,
253,0.97,1840.338,1848.513,The Powerpoint that is currently listed on the agenda is great in nature.,32,,
254,0.97,1848.513,1850.481,That will never ever happen.,32,,
255,0.97,1850.481,1865.363,We need to focus on community resources when approaching mental health concerns and it should absolutely not be going through a violent racist police Department.,32,,
256,0.97,1865.363,1888.086,"There are an absurd amount of documented cases through OPA, general population, where we are well aware that Seattle police Department is not able to handle these situations, not even three months ago they murdered Derek Hayden who was experiencing mental health crisis.",32,,
257,0.97,1888.086,1888.953,Officers are not trained.,32,,
258,0.97,1888.953,1891.756,They should not be responding to these crises.,32,,
259,0.97,1891.756,1899.33,We do have the fire chief on the agenda today and would love to know what happened to those text messages.,32,,
260,0.97,1899.33,1904.769,No one in this county trusts you anymore.,32,,
261,0.97,1904.769,1908.94,Hold yourself accountable.,32,,
262,0.97,1908.94,1909.741,Tell the truth.,32,,
263,0.97,1909.741,1910.074,Abolish SPD.,32,,
264,0.97,1910.074,1912.677,I yield the rest of my time.,32,,
265,0.97,1912.677,1913.378,Okay.,33,,
266,0.97,1913.378,1921.119,"With that, we conclude today's public comment and we will move into the items on the agenda.",33,,
267,0.97,1921.119,1932.664,"As mentioned, first item on the agenda is a crisis response continuum round table.",33,,
268,0.97,1932.664,1944.876,We are joined by the fire chief Harold Scoggins and Jon Ehrenfeld.,33,,
269,0.97,1944.876,1952.65,We are joined by Lieutenant Pisconski heading up a separate unit from the rest of SPD.,33,,
270,0.97,1952.65,1956.788,We'll hear more about that.,33,,
271,0.97,1956.788,1965.163,"We'll hear from Neil Olson, Nicole Davis, Michelle McDaniel from crisis connections.",33,,
272,0.97,1965.163,1978.843,"Tiarra Dearbone with public defender Association, Brandi flood with reach and Maggie host Nick with the downtown emergency center's mobile response team and of course Amy Gore with Council central staff.",33,,
273,0.97,1978.843,1989.22,I will make a few opening remarks and then I will hand it to central staff.,33,,
274,0.97,1989.22,2003.668,"Folks, understand the viewing public, everybody who is part of the existing crisis response continuum as we are hearing about today, this is our existing continuum, has been asked to answer a couple questions.",33,,
275,0.97,2003.668,2005.503,"One, what do you do best?",33,,
276,0.97,2005.503,2006.904,Who do you serve best?,33,,
277,0.97,2006.904,2022.754,What we are seeking to do is seeking to have discussion about current crisis continuum so we can learn more about gaps within that continuum and continue the Council's work to those gaps.,33,,
278,0.97,2022.754,2036.367,I am going to in my opening remarks draw liberally from an October 20 article from the center for American progress on the community Responder model.,33,,
279,0.97,2036.367,2046.677,"The article explains that in cities all over U.S., police have been made responsible for much more than enforcing the law.",33,,
280,0.97,2046.677,2058.99,"Increasingly they're expected to solve every problem in the community from resolving noise complaints, reversing Overdoses, Deescalating behavioral crises.",33,,
281,0.97,2058.99,2071.102,"Yet these can result in unnecessary uses of force, justice system involvement, other adverse outcomes for civilians as well as put a strain on public safety resources.",33,,
282,0.97,2071.102,2078.643,The harmful effects from interactions have not been felt equally by all.,33,,
283,0.97,2078.643,2084.916,"Communities of color have experienced heavy police presence, high rates of arrest, harsh enforcement.",33,,
284,0.97,2084.916,2093.758,The growth has negatively affected people with behavioral health disorders and disabilities whose medical conditions are too often treated like a crime.,33,,
285,0.97,2093.758,2110.575,"According to the International associations of Chiefs of police, they say mere presence of a law enforcement vehicle, officer in uniform and/or a weapon, potential to escalate a situation when a person is in crisis.",33,,
286,0.97,2110.575,2120.718,"Ever expanding role of the police has had negative impact on officers themselves, many of whom have attested to having too much on their plate.",33,,
287,0.97,2120.718,2134.332,A quote from a retired major Neil Franklin who served as head of training for Baltimore police Department is like quotes I have offered from other police officers in the past.,33,,
288,0.97,2134.332,2139.704,"This one says every time 911 receives a call, it is currently job of police to respond.",33,,
289,0.97,2139.704,2141.672,But many calls don't involve a crime.,33,,
290,0.97,2141.672,2154.652,"When they do, many of the crimes are minor and related to quality of life issues such as homelessness, mental health disorders, substance abuse.",33,,
291,0.97,2154.652,2164.195,We need to stop expecting police to do social work and send right trained professionals for low level crimes and noncriminal calls for service.,33,,
292,0.97,2164.195,2179.41,The insurance it I future of justice conducted in depth analysis of 911 data from five cities including Seattle and found Nonemergency incidents nationwide were most frequent type of call for service to 911.,33,,
293,0.97,2179.41,2189.787,Share of low priority Nonurgent calls was 45% in Seattle.,33,,
294,0.97,2189.787,2195.326,Medium priority Nonlife threatening incidents comprised basics in Seattle.,33,,
295,0.97,2195.326,2201.999,"Priority life threatening emergencies made up smallest portion of 911 calls in Seattle, 18%.",33,,
296,0.97,2201.999,2222.119,Relying on police to handle low level calls for service not only has consequences that I named earlier but it also can result in negative police interactions that not only affect residents' health and well being but can erode public trust in policing.,33,,
297,0.97,2222.119,2234.298,Loss of trust can have serious ramifications including reduction in likelihood residents will report crime to law enforcement making it harder for officers to prevent and solve crimes.,33,,
298,0.97,2234.298,2258.556,"With that, I will turn it over to counsel central staff who can talk a little bit about the Council actions we have taken that have sort of created foundation for this discussion as well as some other work that the Council has been doing.",33,,
299,0.97,2258.556,2259.624,Thank you.,33,,
300,0.97,2259.624,2261.225,Good morning Council members.,34,,
301,0.97,2261.225,2268.399,Thank you chair Herbold for the introduction.,34,,
302,0.97,2268.399,2269.533,My name is Amy Gore.,34,,
303,0.97,2269.533,2274.505,We have a brief presentation to provide background and context for the round table today.,34,,
304,0.97,2274.505,2286.784,I know Council members are eager to hear from the panelists so I am going through these slides quickly but we are happy to answer any questions that you have.,34,,
305,0.97,2286.784,2287.218,Next slide please.,34,,
306,0.97,2287.218,2297.161,We thought it would be helpful to ground today's discussion in some of the recent actions Council has taken related to Scaling up alternatives to armed police response.,34,,
307,0.97,2297.161,2313.711,As you recall in August 2020 Council passed resolution 31962 which was based on 2020 blueprint for police divestment and community reinvestment from Decriminalize Seattle and equity now.,34,,
308,0.97,2313.711,2339.937,"Resolution outlined several actions Council intended to pursue including creating a new civilian led Department with a broader approach to public safety, requesting that the chief of police under take 911 call analysis, working to determine enforcement practices that should be Deprioritized based on disproportionate impacts on communities.",34,,
309,0.97,2339.937,2349.046,Shortly there after Mayor issued 202010 which included additional stops to analyze and develop alternatives to current police response system.,34,,
310,0.97,2349.046,2356.387,"In addition to the resolution, Council has taken number of budgetary actions recently to expand the Nonspd response.",34,,
311,0.97,2356.387,2388.519,"For example as part of the 2020 budget revisions Council authorized Nonspd referrals to lead, funded process for community based organizations involved in Nonspd response, requested SPD Civilianization report and funded Seattle community safety initiative with $4 million and additional 12 million for capacity building for community organizations focused on alternative approaches to public safety.",34,,
312,0.97,2388.519,2401.198,"In the 2021 budget Council provided funding for expansion of health 1, made investments and crisis connections and community responders as well as expansion of Desc mobile crisis team.",34,,
313,0.97,2401.198,2421.252,The budget create new safe thriving communities division at Hsd and included over 28 million for Participatory budgeting and 29.9 million for investments represented by equitable communities initiative task force which we just started hearing about at the end of last week.,34,,
314,0.97,2421.252,2428.058,There are several efforts to build off of the actions and investments and prepare next steps.,34,,
315,0.97,2428.058,2441.605,"Seattle police Department, office of Inspector general and Seattle fire Department are all working on analyzing 911 call data to better understand the demand for services to determine what types of responses are needed and at what scale.",34,,
316,0.97,2441.605,2449.413,In addition Council has under taken criminal legal system realignment project which you will hear more about later in this meeting.,34,,
317,0.97,2449.413,2483.347,Council continues to work with Stakeholders particularly community partners through criminal legal realignment task force and which as you are aware was opportunity for many folks both city staff and community partners to learn more about Nonpolice response models used in communities around the country and also we have been working on Debriefing from the Sprint meetings through Debriefs from Councilmember Herbold and Lewis.,34,,
318,0.97,2483.347,2491.689,There is executive working group which meets to discuss the various initiatives and provide coordination and data support.,34,,
319,0.97,2491.689,2499.43,As efforts conclude next steps are to review and examine 911 call analyses currently underway.,34,,
320,0.97,2499.43,2504.468,"The second, to determine demand for calls that could be diverted to unarmed response.",34,,
321,0.97,2504.468,2513.41,To identify gaps within the current service continuum and examine potential labor of alternative responses.,34,,
322,0.97,2513.41,2524.922,All this will hopefully lead to coordinated investments and alternatives in development of operational protocols needed to support continuum of services.,34,,
323,0.97,2524.922,2525.389,Next slide.,34,,
324,0.97,2525.389,2536.634,More specifically next steps for Council include presentation from executive Workgroup on data analysis underway and recommendations made pursuant to executive order 2020-10.,34,,
325,0.97,2536.634,2546.877,"Greg and I are preparing a memo on various components including data analysis, Begans analysis, potential for Council to consider.",34,,
326,0.97,2546.877,2557.354,Our goal is for this to be presented later in the summer so Council will have the information as they're preparing to make investment decisions as part of the 2022 budget.,34,,
327,0.97,2557.354,2564.561,That concludes our brief overview but we are happy to answer questions from the committee.,34,,
328,0.97,2564.561,2566.23,"Thank you so much, Amy.",35,,
329,0.97,2566.23,2573.137,We will pause to see if Council members have questions.,35,,
330,0.97,2573.137,2577.541,"If not, we'll move into the discussion.",35,,
331,0.97,2577.541,2592.823,We will hear from Desc and then from lead and then the crisis response community and health 1 and then we'll wrap up with crisis connection.,35,,
332,0.97,2592.823,2603.5,"The thing I mentioned, we've been asking folks to focus on, what gaps you see in the--what is your role in crisis response continuum?",35,,
333,0.97,2603.5,2605.069,What can you do best?,35,,
334,0.97,2605.069,2608.238,Who do you serve best?,35,,
335,0.97,2608.238,2614.612,"Then from your perspective, what gaps do you see in crisis response continuum?",35,,
336,0.97,2614.612,2617.348,We'll hear a go around on the first question.,35,,
337,0.97,2617.348,2620.384,What is your role in crisis response continuum?,35,,
338,0.97,2620.384,2621.986,What do you do best?,35,,
339,0.97,2621.986,2623.687,Who do you serve best?,35,,
340,0.97,2623.687,2628.559,Then we will go around again and answer the second question.,35,,
341,0.97,2628.559,2679.71,"I want to say for my participation in the what works Sprint effort that many folks from the Council and executive and community members have been participating in, an issue that really comes to for me that our friends at reach and lead have been really doing a good job of being at the forefront is the concern that a 911 triggered system that has some concern, even that time of system, an armed response will be sent disproportionately to people of color.",35,,
342,0.97,2679.71,2700.664,"Similarly there is the concern that if we have a system outside of 911, that people will call for the Nonarmed response for people in mental health crisis or other noncriminal needs disproportionately benefiting people who are not people of color.",35,,
343,0.97,2700.664,2717.448,So that is really for me a question that we need to have another conversation about but I know will come up in the thread through the presentations today.,35,,
344,0.97,2717.448,2718.882,So let's kick it off.,35,,
345,0.97,2718.882,2728.625,"When you answer sort of the first question, if you can just be sure that you state your name and organization, that would be great.",35,,
346,0.97,2728.625,2734.765,"Question one, what is your role in crisis response continuum?",35,,
347,0.97,2734.765,2737.067,What do you do best?,35,,
348,0.97,2737.067,2741.105,Who do you serve best.,35,,
349,0.97,2741.105,2741.338,Maggie.,35,,
350,0.97,2741.338,2742.84,"Thanks, Lisa.",36,,
351,0.97,2742.84,2743.64,Who do we serve?,36,,
352,0.97,2743.64,2747.377,We serve folks that are in crisis.,36,,
353,0.97,2747.377,2758.288,I have think it is important to define what crisis is verses behavioral health emergency.,36,,
354,0.97,2758.288,2774.771,"So behavioral health crisis is a turning point of a condition or situation somebody is in, a time when a different or important decision must be made.",36,,
355,0.97,2774.771,2803.7,"So sort of everybody in the county through the mobile crisis team and we work in coordination with law enforcement as referent fire, designated responders which are folks that can take rights and put folks in the hospital.",36,,
356,0.97,2803.7,2804.802,Crisis connections.,36,,
357,0.97,2804.802,2813.844,Get refers from individuals in the community.,36,,
358,0.97,2813.844,2816.48,"Thank you, Maggie.",37,,
359,0.97,2816.48,2831.728,"Moving onto the second for answering that first question, Tiarra Dearbone and Brandi flood.",37,,
360,0.97,2831.728,2832.229,Good morning.,38,,
361,0.97,2832.229,2840.637,There are a couple points I would like to make about our role in this.,38,,
362,0.97,2840.637,2849.479,"Provide past for community referrals, we have been response for many of the low level law violation concerns.",38,,
363,0.97,2849.479,2871.134,"So we really have been putting in effort to work Collaboratively with businesses, with other social service providers, community members to make referrals to the program for things like substance use, sex work, low level theft, those types of things, definitely property crimes, that should have alternative response.",38,,
364,0.97,2871.134,2876.573,We would love to continue doing this work if capacity allows.,38,,
365,0.97,2876.573,2899.229,"It has been extremely important and connecting people to resources prevents the people from eventually entering crisis if they have somebody who is supportive of them, they're receiving services needed to meet their basic needs and preventing the need to engage in law violations in order to survive.",38,,
366,0.97,2899.229,2906.603,Another important role here is the collaboration with all the other agencies.,38,,
367,0.97,2906.603,2913.31,It is important that we really see ourselves in pre and post crisis.,38,,
368,0.97,2913.31,2935.966,It is also extremely important that people are connected immediately into Longterm care that will follow an individual providing the care that they actually need to meet basic needs and to address that sort of behavior without using criminal legal system.,38,,
369,0.97,2935.966,2943.407,I am going to pass to Brandie to talk about what we do best and who we serve.,38,,
370,0.97,2943.407,2950.213,"Really as service provider for the individuals, that's the role she's in charge of.",38,,
371,0.97,2950.213,2950.514,Thanks.,39,,
372,0.97,2950.514,2962.626,I am director of community justice for reach and we manage clinical side of the contract working with case managers providing Longterm intensive case management to the clients we serve.,39,,
373,0.97,2962.626,2971.902,My role is to show up for individuals with a wide range of behavioral health issues in the intersection of crime there for the folks.,39,,
374,0.97,2971.902,3003.3,"What we do best is serve people with significant trauma, people of color, black folks, Unhoused, people using substances, people who just because their trauma and making crimes of poverty and substance use, we show up at the intersection for them because even with alternative line, police will still be called for the people just by the point of view and bias of the caller and the fact that a crime is happening.",39,,
375,0.97,3003.3,3005.802,I think Miss Thompson said it best.,39,,
376,0.97,3005.802,3012.576,"The woman who showed up stealing for food, though it is a crime of poverty and shouldn't be a crime, it is still a crime.",39,,
377,0.97,3012.576,3016.079,So police will show up in that incident.,39,,
378,0.97,3016.079,3023.487,What we do best is show up for the folks and serve them Longterm.,39,,
379,0.97,3023.487,3028.058,"Everything from connecting people to family, helping people navigate through criminal legal system.",39,,
380,0.97,3028.058,3041.738,"I know we shouldn't have the criminal legal system but I can't leave those people behind as they're trying to remove the barrier which can be difficult when you have significant trauma, diagnosed mental health.",39,,
381,0.97,3041.738,3044.241,We are helping connect people to housing.,39,,
382,0.97,3044.241,3046.71,Our housing system is not great.,39,,
383,0.97,3046.71,3055.619,There are really no options but we work hard to make connections and work through assurances to get people housed.,39,,
384,0.97,3055.619,3060.857,People who have never had housing before connect to robust services.,39,,
385,0.97,3060.857,3076.173,If we have robust services to meet needs of folks we might have less crime in communities and we would have less police surveillance and police power in communities.,39,,
386,0.97,3076.173,3078.175,Thank you so much.,40,,
387,0.97,3078.175,3090.287,"Next, we are going to hear from Lieutenant Eric Pisconski with Seattle police Department response unit.",40,,
388,0.97,3090.287,3090.654,Thank you.,41,,
389,0.97,3090.654,3102.566,"I think when you talk about what is our role in the crisis continuum, I think all three that spoke previously defined what our role is.",41,,
390,0.97,3102.566,3106.169,"We are the safety net, catch all.",41,,
391,0.97,3106.169,3111.608,There aren't resources that people can directly connect with and so the default becomes 911.,41,,
392,0.97,3111.608,3114.945,That is kind of our role.,41,,
393,0.97,3114.945,3121.518,"As 911, we don't have the option to not go.",41,,
394,0.97,3121.518,3131.895,"Someone calls 911 and we have to respond, even if at the heart of the matter we inherently know this is not a police engagement response.",41,,
395,0.97,3131.895,3141.771,"This is not a crime or it is such a low level or as pointed out, a crime of poverty, what is the action that we are going to take?",41,,
396,0.97,3141.771,3144.174,We have to respond regardless.,41,,
397,0.97,3144.174,3154.017,So our role is certainly within crisis response unit and Councilmember as you are pointed out we are speciality unit within the police Department.,41,,
398,0.97,3154.017,3169.933,"So there are two conversations there of what is the overall 911 response when someone calls and patrol officers are going to respond to call verses crisis response unit specifically in our role, in our capacity.",41,,
399,0.97,3169.933,3190.62,"It is really to try and take that Holistic approach, try and come in, stabilize an acute situation and then make referrals to community partners and Stakeholders for most appropriate services and follow up.",41,,
400,0.97,3190.62,3203.8,Not looking for necessarily a criminal approach to it or a law enforcement approach to it but really redirecting folks back to the more appropriate community based services out there.,41,,
401,0.97,3203.8,3212.542,"That's definitely our role and mission as a unit, broader within the police Department.",41,,
402,0.97,3212.542,3226.957,We try and base our training over the past few years of really amplifying what community resources are that are out there and understanding what our role is of again that default.,41,,
403,0.97,3226.957,3227.39,People call 911.,41,,
404,0.97,3227.39,3229.859,But we are not case managers.,41,,
405,0.97,3229.859,3232.963,We are not Longterm care providers.,41,,
406,0.97,3232.963,3253.717,We are not acute care providers for individuals that are experiencing a variety of behavioral health issues which could be mental health or substance abuse or anything along that spectrum and really trying to leverage services that are in the community whether city based or county based and go from there.,41,,
407,0.97,3253.717,3258.054,That's our role and what we are looking at.,41,,
408,0.97,3258.054,3260.223,What do we do best?,41,,
409,0.97,3260.223,3263.159,Who do we serve best?,41,,
410,0.97,3263.159,3283.113,"As crisis response unit, our goal is to focus on individuals that are maybe disproportionate Utilizers of the 911 services to see if we can again redirect them back to more important services and more importantly reduce number of patrol responses that might be out.",41,,
411,0.97,3283.113,3294.19,"If the 911 call comes in, if we can reduce number of 911 calls associated with an individual, it doesn't matter why they came in.",41,,
412,0.97,3294.19,3308.838,"About you if we can reduce, patrol is not responding to those and those individuals better engaged with the services, that's number one priority along with those that are presenting imminent likelihood of harm.",41,,
413,0.97,3308.838,3312.976,That's really our focus especially as crisis response unit.,41,,
414,0.97,3312.976,3332.529,"If you have that individual that is actively suicide al, actively putting themselves in a state of harm, how can we try and stabilize that situation and then again connect the individual back to the most appropriate resources?",41,,
415,0.97,3332.529,3342.272,Can you talk a little bit about--I apologize the way we have laid out the questions.,42,,
416,0.97,3342.272,3345.842,It may not feel conducive to showing your slides.,42,,
417,0.97,3345.842,3353.049,Maggie you had a slide and Lieutenant you had some slides as well.,42,,
418,0.97,3353.049,3376.072,"I know for a couple perhaps for the crisis response unit as well as mobile crisis team, the Department pairs with mental health providers from Desc in the instance of the crisis response unit, I believe.",42,,
419,0.97,3376.072,3387.717,And then there is also a requirement for mobile crisis team to be dispatched through law enforcement.,42,,
420,0.97,3387.717,3392.222,"If you can maybe touch a little bit on that, that would be helpful.",42,,
421,0.97,3392.222,3392.589,Absolutely.,43,,
422,0.97,3392.589,3397.36,Thank you for the opportunity.,43,,
423,0.97,3397.36,3404.367,"We are very unique here in Seattle and with crisis response unit, we follow what's called a Coresponder model.",43,,
424,0.97,3404.367,3405.268,That's how we deploy.,43,,
425,0.97,3405.268,3411.541,That is taking a mental health professional and putting them in a car with a specially trained police officer.,43,,
426,0.97,3411.541,3433.062,"We are able to respond out to both in progress calls ton a patrol resource in support of that because the volume of crisis calls that come through Seattle and through the Department are around about 10,000 a year.",43,,
427,0.97,3433.062,3437.033,Our small niche group cannot possibly respond to every single one.,43,,
428,0.97,3437.033,3448.711,We try and respond to assist patrol with a mental health professional and a police officer and then the other side of that would be all the reports that get written come through our unit.,43,,
429,0.97,3448.711,3455.819,Then we do triage in conjunction with Mhps to be able to determine is there value added?,43,,
430,0.97,3455.819,3466.529,"Is there additional follow up we might be able to provide reaching to case managers or service providers, making a warm hand off.",43,,
431,0.97,3466.529,3477.073,"One of your clients had interactions over the weekend or over the last week, might want to see if we can get them back in, maybe Reengage them with those services.",43,,
432,0.97,3477.073,3493.523,We are trying to handle both ends of that equation within our unit and then yes with the ability of the mobile crisis team it is a tremendous resource we have at our disposal.,43,,
433,0.97,3493.523,3494.657,It is County wide.,43,,
434,0.97,3494.657,3502.065,But we are spoiled with Seattle being the seat that they are down the street and are local for us.,43,,
435,0.97,3502.065,3520.483,"We have had a strong relationship with Maggie and her group and Desc in general who oversees mobile crisis team and crisis solution center, crisis diversion facility, that we are able to make direct referrals in the field.",43,,
436,0.97,3520.483,3532.428,Any officer can make a direct referral in the field to the mobile crisis team and have them respond out to a call that an officer does not need to actually wait for.,43,,
437,0.97,3532.428,3546.809,"If an officer responds to a situation, determines some type of broad crisis issue going on, there is no real law enforcement role here.",43,,
438,0.97,3546.809,3560.123,"Officers can make the call from the field to mobile crisis team to the tune of we are in the 500, 600 a year where officers are making direct referrals to mobile crisis team.",43,,
439,0.97,3560.123,3568.031,Then folks from Maggie's team respond to the field and connect them with a Plethora of services that are available.,43,,
440,0.97,3568.031,3577.307,We removed the law enforcement aspect which is a great option.,43,,
441,0.97,3577.307,3595.625,"In addition, we have five mental health professionals, five full time officers, a Sergeant that over sees the group, the mental health professionals are contracted through Desc and that is managed by human services division.",43,,
442,0.97,3595.625,3603.232,There is a Firewalling between police Department and Mhps so they have their own reporting.,43,,
443,0.97,3603.232,3606.769,They are employees of Desc and that's a contracted spot.,43,,
444,0.97,3606.769,3614.677,"Thank you to city council for approving that funding a couple years ago, a year and a half ago now.",43,,
445,0.97,3614.677,3618.581,So that expanded us to the five Mhps.,43,,
446,0.97,3618.581,3619.549,Thank you.,44,,
447,0.97,3619.549,3626.623,"Before we move on, Maggie did you have anything you wanted to add here?",44,,
448,0.97,3626.623,3626.889,Yes.,45,,
449,0.97,3626.889,3631.561,Thank you for the second opportunity.,45,,
450,0.97,3631.561,3636.299,Our mobile crisis team like Eric said are comprised of mental health professionals.,45,,
451,0.97,3636.299,3649.012,"Once we get the call from fire, police, Dcr, crisis connections, we send mental health professionals to assess for risk.",45,,
452,0.97,3649.012,3660.857,Risk is what we consider emergency where somebody is not able to care for themselves or make decisions or are a threat to themselves or the community.,45,,
453,0.97,3660.857,3675.038,"Often in these cases, we will work in coordination with the police and get them to the hospital where they can be assessed by our designated crisis responders.",45,,
454,0.97,3675.038,3684.847,"Up ten when mobile crisis team does respond, we are seeing folks that are in the crisis, are needing to make a different decision in the moment.",45,,
455,0.97,3684.847,3697.06,"These mental health professionals are able to provide resources, talk with people, get them to higher level of care if needed.",45,,
456,0.97,3697.06,3702.999,Eric referred to the diversion facility which is a 72 hour stabilization program.,45,,
457,0.97,3702.999,3730.059,"Mostly what the mobile crisis team does is move the individual away from the formal institution of policing and fire Dcrs and into the hands over time to other outreach agencies or agencies that can provide Longterm case management connection back to community, family, etc.",45,,
458,0.97,3730.059,3732.395,Thank you.,46,,
459,0.97,3732.395,3741.237,"Before I move on, I want to--correct me if I am wrong.",46,,
460,0.97,3741.237,3769.465,Desc mobile response team is focused on a law enforcement referral where there is not a need for a law enforcement response whereas crisis response unit is focused on bringing behavioral health experts to instances where there is a perceived threat to self or others.,46,,
461,0.97,3769.465,3776.139,We heard folks in public comment refer to the unfortunate death of Derek Hayden at the hands of police officers.,46,,
462,0.97,3776.139,3778.775,That was not a crisis response unit response.,46,,
463,0.97,3778.775,3784.147,Some of those officers may have crisis response training.,46,,
464,0.97,3784.147,3793.789,Spd works hard to ensure that its officers have crisis training but that was not crisis response unit training.,46,,
465,0.97,3793.789,3802.532,Again this exercise today is about our continuum and where there are gaps.,46,,
466,0.97,3802.532,3835.331,"I know there are folks in the community, we recently heard from mothers for police accountability who have a lot of concern that our crisis response unit run out of SPD to respond to people in mental health crisis with behavioral health expertise, that that unit is not functioning in the way in vision because of the staffing shortfalls SPD is experiencing right now.",46,,
467,0.97,3835.331,3848.344,"I want to highlight when talking about a continuum, we are talking about a continuum that responds to people across a number of different needs and other efforts to try to get that right.",46,,
468,0.97,3848.344,3859.188,So needs do not go unmet or are not met with the wrong response.,46,,
469,0.97,3859.188,3866.729,Looking to see if there are questions from colleagues.,46,,
470,0.97,3866.729,3875.137,"If not, we'll move on to health 1. Scoggins and Jon.",46,,
471,0.97,3875.137,3876.038,Good morning.,47,,
472,0.97,3876.038,3884.347,Thank you for providing us the opportunity to be here.,47,,
473,0.97,3884.347,3885.915,I am program director.,47,,
474,0.97,3885.915,3892.755,I oversee our Mih program which includes health 1 team.,47,,
475,0.97,3892.755,3902.765,Health 1 is a multi disciplinary field out of the fire Department that staffs two units with specially trained firefighters and human services Department case managers.,47,,
476,0.97,3902.765,3907.403,We take responses in a number of ways.,47,,
477,0.97,3907.403,3915.611,"We are directly dispatched by 911 center on minor injure falls, welfare checks.",47,,
478,0.97,3915.611,3923.886,We respond to operations in the field when they identify the need for an alternative response that's not police or fire disposition.,47,,
479,0.97,3923.886,3929.025,We also do quite a bit of Proactive outreach and follow up with established clients.,47,,
480,0.97,3929.025,3935.931,There are sort of three general categories clients fall into in health 1. one is people aging in place.,47,,
481,0.97,3935.931,3948.311,There are people in some manner of behavioral health or substance abuse crisis and third is people suffering from the social consequences of homelessness or extreme poverty.,47,,
482,0.97,3948.311,3955.484,Obviously these are very much overlapping categories.,47,,
483,0.97,3955.484,3962.925,"As far as behavioral crisis response, we primarily focus on the lower to mid tier of the crises.",47,,
484,0.97,3962.925,3975.638,"We are not able due to staffing to intervene to people who are Vialen, potentially vial El Nino, psychotic, unable to engage, typically we would let police units take a lead.",47,,
485,0.97,3975.638,3986.949,"We see lower level behavioral crisis with substance abuse, Intoxication, depression, anxiety, everything on that continuum.",47,,
486,0.97,3986.949,3995.658,I think what we do well is act as refers and Connectors with other resources.,47,,
487,0.97,3995.658,4004.8,One of the things we try to emphasize is when people are encountered with crisis in the field these are extremely complex cases.,47,,
488,0.97,4004.8,4014.744,"It is rare for the instances to be resolved, for lack of a better word, via single encounter whether that is police, fire, or community group.",47,,
489,0.97,4014.744,4037.299,"The individuals typically need a fair amount of follow up and referral, short term case management, making referrals to partners such as crisis connections, Washington state Longterm care system, Desc host team, supportive housing homeless services, etc.",47,,
490,0.97,4037.299,4040.336,We act as bridge and Facilitator.,47,,
491,0.97,4040.336,4050.246,"We are city wide, have a particular emphasis on communities that have a particular need by being under Resourced, under represented.",47,,
492,0.97,4050.246,4057.82,We have a high call volume and respond with compassionate lens.,47,,
493,0.97,4057.82,4067.63,We see ourselves as the bridge between initial moment of crisis that often begins with 911 call and bridge to other services.,47,,
494,0.97,4067.63,4071.801,We are extremely open-ended in our capacity so we don't have to take you to the hospital.,47,,
495,0.97,4071.801,4075.738,We don't have to take you to a particular clinic.,47,,
496,0.97,4075.738,4091.787,On each call the crew is able to talk with the client and Collaboratively come up with the best solution whether it's taking to crisis solution center or back home or to a clinic or refer you to a program.,47,,
497,0.97,4091.787,4094.39,They do very open-ended problem solving each time.,47,,
498,0.97,4094.39,4103.566,With that I will turn it over for any questions that you might have.,47,,
499,0.97,4103.566,4104.767,Thank you again.,47,,
500,0.97,4104.767,4105.334,Thank you.,48,,
501,0.97,4105.334,4122.251,"Much like focus of health one not just on crisis response but also in follow up, I want to flag that ESC also has a program that has been funded by counsel I will.",48,,
502,0.97,4122.251,4136.499,"I believe it is a pilot at this point, behavioral response team that has both triage and hot line number.",48,,
503,0.97,4136.499,4169.231,"They work on not just responding to crisis but doing post crisis work to create links in the community, build Longterm housing, case management, wanting to flag as well that we have in the continuum city response focused on crisis response and follow up as well as the city response as well.",48,,
504,0.97,4169.231,4172.167,Brandie I believe you had a question or comment.,48,,
505,0.97,4172.167,4174.036,I had one comment.,49,,
506,0.97,4174.036,4182.845,I wanted to definitely state that we have the same concerns the community has about crisis response.,49,,
507,0.97,4182.845,4194.59,For us this year more than 80% of referrals came from the community and members who said they are committing crimes but we don't want to call the police because we don't know what's going to happen.,49,,
508,0.97,4194.59,4205.034,We have had communities across the city that have called us to do our own serving people before police are contacted because they have those concerns.,49,,
509,0.97,4205.034,4212.041,The whole year we have gotten maybe two police referrals but the majority come from communities.,49,,
510,0.97,4212.041,4215.844,We don't go in to serve folks with law enforcement.,49,,
511,0.97,4215.844,4217.413,We go with our outreach work.,49,,
512,0.97,4217.413,4229.625,A lot of times we already know the people through homelessness services work.,49,,
513,0.97,4229.625,4231.76,Thank you.,50,,
514,0.97,4231.76,4237.967,I am also receiving inquiries from people who don't want to call 911.,50,,
515,0.97,4237.967,4243.572,I am increasingly referring people to crisis connections.,50,,
516,0.97,4243.572,4258.887,"With that, we will turn to our team at crisis connections to talk a little bit about the question of what your role is and what you do best and who you serve best.",50,,
517,0.97,4258.887,4260.289,Thank you.,51,,
518,0.97,4260.289,4264.693,Senior director of clinical operations for crisis connections.,51,,
519,0.97,4264.693,4266.095,Crisis connections does quite a bit.,51,,
520,0.97,4266.095,4277.606,"We operate at a state level, have lines and services across Washington state such as warm lines for folks who are lonely, depressed, isolated.",51,,
521,0.97,4277.606,4283.946,It is statewide for teens in crisis or who need emotional support.,51,,
522,0.97,4283.946,4290.886,"It operates with chat, with phone calls, staffed by teens with lived experience or who offer concerns.",51,,
523,0.97,4290.886,4301.697,The help line is for folks with Addictions looking for resources.,51,,
524,0.97,4301.697,4312.508,"As far as crisis intervention the purpose of the conversation, we have been in operation since 1964 as regional crisis hot line.",51,,
525,0.97,4312.508,4316.245,Crisis connections kind of operates like center of the crisis web.,51,,
526,0.97,4316.245,4320.883,We get calls from law enforcement looking for information.,51,,
527,0.97,4320.883,4325.654,"We get calls from commune members concerned about their brother, Scissor, loved ones.",51,,
528,0.97,4325.654,4335.497,We get calls from folks wanting to speak to a trained volunteer.,51,,
529,0.97,4335.497,4339.635,We get contacts from the entire continuum of care.,51,,
530,0.97,4339.635,4345.274,We operate that Hub model with a really robust volunteer model.,51,,
531,0.97,4345.274,4353.115,"Crisis connections has about 330 trained volunteers who are community members who live, work, eat, sleep in the city of Seattle.",51,,
532,0.97,4353.115,4360.122,They volunteer their time on the crisis line.,51,,
533,0.97,4360.122,4364.893,Our goal is to resolve at the lowest level possible.,51,,
534,0.97,4364.893,4370.099,We don't want people to have negative interactions with law enforcement.,51,,
535,0.97,4370.099,4372.234,We don't want to clog the law enforcement system.,51,,
536,0.97,4372.234,4377.139,A lot of calls are handled on the phone with trained volunteer.,51,,
537,0.97,4377.139,4381.61,"There is no police dispatch, no mobile crisis team dispatch.",51,,
538,0.97,4381.61,4389.184,We are handling calls with compassionate mobile support.,51,,
539,0.97,4389.184,4391.987,"We had 8,000 calls last month.",51,,
540,0.97,4391.987,4394.289,Average response was 8 seconds.,51,,
541,0.97,4394.289,4395.858,We are here 24/7.,51,,
542,0.97,4395.858,4396.992,We want the calls.,51,,
543,0.97,4396.992,4399.628,We want to speak to those folks.,51,,
544,0.97,4399.628,4402.865,"We are alternative to police response, to armed response.",51,,
545,0.97,4402.865,4408.837,We have the ability to triage calls to the appropriate level of care.,51,,
546,0.97,4408.837,4423.685,"Whether that's let's get the person to the er, get an ambulance, law enforcement, let's get a safety appointment that involves friends or family members.",51,,
547,0.97,4423.685,4430.826,We operate up and down that response system.,51,,
548,0.97,4430.826,4434.663,We do quite a bit of prevention work.,51,,
549,0.97,4434.663,4440.602,With he do survivors of suicide support Groupsgrief and loss for those who survive suicide.,51,,
550,0.97,4440.602,4445.607,We are knee deep in crisis and want to serve these folks.,51,,
551,0.97,4445.607,4447.81,We want to talk to them.,51,,
552,0.97,4447.81,4449.244,We want to help them.,51,,
553,0.97,4449.244,4453.882,I will let Nicole speak deeper into the crisis services Department.,51,,
554,0.97,4453.882,4457.286,She does a lot more of the day to day operations.,51,,
555,0.97,4457.286,4459.688,I am Nicole Davis.,52,,
556,0.97,4459.688,4460.522,I run crisis lines.,52,,
557,0.97,4460.522,4468.063,We really are a Hub of information for providers and linkage.,52,,
558,0.97,4468.063,4476.738,"We have connections into the system to understand more of what's going on with community members, if they have a history of behavioral health treatment.",52,,
559,0.97,4476.738,4481.577,If somebody is enrolled we can get them connected to current providers.,52,,
560,0.97,4481.577,4492.554,"We can connect police and mobile crisis team their providers for more continuation of care, better response by people who know them.",52,,
561,0.97,4492.554,4499.094,"We have strong relationships with designated crisis responders, mobile crisis team.",52,,
562,0.97,4499.094,4505.767,We manage linkage for them across the state and strongly in the county for many years.,52,,
563,0.97,4505.767,4524.686,"We have the country to over the last year and a half to have a project called one call which is for first responders, to be able to call and get the relevant information, if somebody has been in the system before.",52,,
564,0.97,4524.686,4531.56,It's answered 24 hours a day by a mental health Clinician.,52,,
565,0.97,4531.56,4544.973,"We offer problem solving, suggestions on how first responders can potentially have additional information as they're facing somebody in the community who is experiencing behavioral health crisis.",52,,
566,0.97,4544.973,4572.234,It's a really great system with volunteers who come in energized and ready to offer callers emotional support and of course monitored by a set of really committed staff to making sure everybody gets linked and connected to services that they are needing.,52,,
567,0.97,4572.234,4574.002,Thank you.,53,,
568,0.97,4574.002,4580.809,Let's do another round of discussion around the second question we have here.,53,,
569,0.97,4580.809,4609.838,"Opening it up to ask what gaps you see in the crisis response continuum, whether or not there are populations not well served, what racial equity concerns folks have, gaps in scale, patient issues that need to be resolved, coordination dispatch or anything else I may not have flagged here as a gap that we need to work together to address.",53,,
570,0.97,4609.838,4614.076,We can start again with Maggie.,53,,
571,0.97,4614.076,4614.643,Thank you.,54,,
572,0.97,4614.643,4624.319,"In our continuum, we see people on the worst day of their lives and get them to where they need to go.",54,,
573,0.97,4624.319,4644.673,"We move them down the continuum of crisis into outreach and one of the major gaps is coordination between this system, making sure that we are all coordinating our services and doing soft hand offs, that kind of thing.",54,,
574,0.97,4644.673,4648.51,So that is a great need.,54,,
575,0.97,4648.51,4666.695,"The other is making sure that individuals are getting to their communities, that they're being served by people that look like them, that value their culture and their beliefs.",54,,
576,0.97,4666.695,4675.07,We certainly do not have enough programs to serve everybody that hits the crisis system.,54,,
577,0.97,4675.07,4691.053,"Between the mobile crisis team and crisis diversion facility, we see about 4,000 calls a year and since starting, we have seen 28,000 people we have made contact with.",54,,
578,0.97,4691.053,4707.469,"Some of the folks are coming through the system time and time again which speaks to, part of it is relationship and part of it is somebody needs to have a couple hitting the crisis system a couple times.",54,,
579,0.97,4707.469,4727.122,"Being able to hand them to agency partners that are culturally competent that honor somebody's recovery through harm reduction, trauma informed care and strength based.",54,,
580,0.97,4727.122,4729.725,Thank you.,55,,
581,0.97,4729.725,4730.725,Lead and reach.,55,,
582,0.97,4730.725,4730.992,Brandie.,55,,
583,0.97,4730.992,4731.359,Thank you.,56,,
584,0.97,4731.359,4746.141,I know it may look like there are a lot of service providers and a lot of alternatives to law enforcement.,56,,
585,0.97,4746.141,4763.058,"I just wanted to emphasize that there is a lot of focus on trying to get somebody else to respond for things that are not crimes that law enforcement has been responding to, which is great.",56,,
586,0.97,4763.058,4772.367,But the people that we serve are at the intersection of crime and behavioral health or poverty.,56,,
587,0.97,4772.367,4801.763,"So our focus really is on individuals who are impact the community because of engaging in law violations, usually a group of people who are invisible or pushed into margins, individuals not connected typically to services, individuals continually Criminalized over and over because of experiencing poverty.",56,,
588,0.97,4801.763,4815.944,"The Longterm case management really is important here because we definitely need to build what happens up front, like what is the response, but how is that person taken care of in the future?",56,,
589,0.97,4815.944,4821.616,How is the person's real needs addressed?,56,,
590,0.97,4821.616,4823.685,How are Cronic conditions addressed?,56,,
591,0.97,4823.685,4827.088,"Some people have been experiencing Incarceration over and over for 20, 30, 40 years.",56,,
592,0.97,4827.088,4855.55,"Some of the people have been experiencing homelessness for decades, experiencing substance use disorder, unmet behavioral needs for years and need Longterm intensive care to prevent crises from coming up again for the same individual and in order to prevent people from calling 911 on the individuals.",56,,
593,0.97,4855.55,4861.623,We finally also have a community that has increased desire in alternative response to crime.,56,,
594,0.97,4861.623,4873.435,"Like we have businesses, have organizations have individuals trying to ask us to respond for crime.",56,,
595,0.97,4873.435,4881.409,They're talking specifically about criminal activity.,56,,
596,0.97,4881.409,4884.913,"Finally want an alternative response, want to lean to those kind of responses.",56,,
597,0.97,4884.913,4887.148,We don't have the capacity to do it.,56,,
598,0.97,4887.148,4902.631,It's never been to scale the way it needs to be and now we have exponential growth and desire for lead response and lead has not been able to expand like that.,56,,
599,0.97,4902.631,4924.185,It is sad to be in the work and seeing that people want to believe in a response that we have believed in for so long and people finally want to use it and we are starting to turn people away or starting to have to say no or having to really Prioritize accepting only a small number of individuals.,56,,
600,0.97,4924.185,4927.622,It's sad and extremely difficult work.,56,,
601,0.97,4927.622,4942.437,This is even after the Council's 2019 slide to bring lead to scale by 2023.,56,,
602,0.97,4942.437,4947.609,"We don't know what that looks like after the past year, bringing lead to scale.",56,,
603,0.97,4947.609,4953.848,But there is extremely increased demand and not enough resources to meet that demand.,56,,
604,0.97,4953.848,4958.653,I will pass it to Brandie.,56,,
605,0.97,4958.653,4969.831,"When we talk about the gaps, we know for sure in America that the war on drugs is a vicious thing that's impacted many people.",57,,
606,0.97,4969.831,4976.838,In my own living experience I have been impacted with family and loved ones.,57,,
607,0.97,4976.838,4980.041,We are dealing with that aftermath.,57,,
608,0.97,4980.041,4982.077,People will be dealing with that for 20 years.,57,,
609,0.97,4982.077,4985.347,You can't have a one time crisis stop.,57,,
610,0.97,4985.347,4991.286,It has to be Longterm case management.,57,,
611,0.97,4991.286,5003.298,"We know the people are not Prioritized for housing at the right rate, the legal stuff, with even getting services.",57,,
612,0.97,5003.298,5005.5,I am particularly talking about black folks.,57,,
613,0.97,5005.5,5010.271,They don't even fit into gaps of other homeless and Healthcare systems to get help.,57,,
614,0.97,5010.271,5017.846,The only way they can get help is through the intersection where crime is happening about you is racist in itself.,57,,
615,0.97,5017.846,5020.181,We are with them for that Longterm.,57,,
616,0.97,5020.181,5029.657,"We need to be taken to scale, to be in more communities, discussing that we are able to do this community referral in a real way for these people who have been impacted.",57,,
617,0.97,5029.657,5031.292,We have to do this.,57,,
618,0.97,5031.292,5045.24,Even though as a country we recognize how the war on drugs has been racist we haven't been able to rectify that with giving robust services to be sustainable and Reintegrate.,57,,
619,0.97,5045.24,5058.72,"When I see that gap you have to have the over lay of analysis, Longterm services, services that connect them to sustainable things like housing, mental health, Healthcare, legal system.",57,,
620,0.97,5058.72,5072.967,That has to be beyond crisis response.,57,,
621,0.97,5072.967,5073.501,Thanks.,58,,
622,0.97,5073.501,5073.802,Lieutenant.,58,,
623,0.97,5073.802,5074.069,Yeah.,59,,
624,0.97,5074.069,5078.039,A lot of really poignant things brought up by the previous three.,59,,
625,0.97,5078.039,5084.145,We see a lot of those same issues that we are encountering.,59,,
626,0.97,5084.145,5086.648,Scale is certainly an issue.,59,,
627,0.97,5086.648,5096.491,"As I had mentioned, at the current rate, Seattle police Department has been 10,000 crisis calls a year that we are responding to.",59,,
628,0.97,5096.491,5102.63,The math works out to about 26 a day.,59,,
629,0.97,5102.63,5103.264,We have five teams.,59,,
630,0.97,5103.264,5117.745,"There is just no way to appropriately respond with that capacity, to be out there on a 24/7 basis.",59,,
631,0.97,5117.745,5126.254,"We are managing that with smoking mirrors, with a lot of just doing the best we can with the resources that we've got.",59,,
632,0.97,5126.254,5132.293,"We are experiencing, even with those five, we are experiencing short staffing issues now as well.",59,,
633,0.97,5132.293,5145.206,We are not even at our full capacity of what that looks like.,59,,
634,0.97,5145.206,5145.64,Some gaps there.,59,,
635,0.97,5145.64,5151.513,If there wants to be some approach in applying that.,59,,
636,0.97,5151.513,5155.517,I was jotting some notes down.,59,,
637,0.97,5155.517,5179.307,"With the alternatives and having Nonpolice responses to a lot of the types of calls, we actually see a high percentage of crisis calls that get generated for the Department that become 911 calls are coming from the service providers shelves.",59,,
638,0.97,5179.307,5186.147,"Whether they're supportive housing facilities, various case managers, facilities that might be offering services, stuff like that.",59,,
639,0.97,5186.147,5193.555,We have extremely large percentage of crisis calls that are being generated by service providers.,59,,
640,0.97,5193.555,5206.301,That really puts things in a Quandary because if the question is how do we not have police respond and instead we have alternative social service providers giving that response?,59,,
641,0.97,5206.301,5212.874,But they're the ones calling 911 now to come and connect with their clientele.,59,,
642,0.97,5212.874,5226.821,"So we kind of get into a circular conversation there a little bit, excuse me, of what the response is going to look like as a whole from the law enforcement standpoint.",59,,
643,0.97,5226.821,5237.332,"As a Department, as some of you are aware, some of you might not be, we actually track--excuse me.",59,,
644,0.97,5237.332,5242.203,I had to try and clear my throat.,59,,
645,0.97,5242.203,5242.804,We track crisis interactions.,59,,
646,0.97,5242.804,5255.617,"In there we have a lot of check boxes that are related to everything from the observable words, actions, behaviors of the individual, so a an officer might be encountering.",59,,
647,0.97,5255.617,5259.454,Then to the closing end of what those dispositions are.,59,,
648,0.97,5259.454,5263.891,So was it a referral to services?,59,,
649,0.97,5263.891,5269.897,Was it involuntary or voluntary trip to the hospital?,59,,
650,0.97,5269.897,5273.768,Was it an arrest?,59,,
651,0.97,5273.768,5276.104,What are those possible dispositions there?,59,,
652,0.97,5276.104,5290.752,"Now we are six plus years into tracking that so we are closing in on 60,000 crisis Templates that we have data associated with and we track at a less than 10% arrest rate.",59,,
653,0.97,5290.752,5302.363,"So far all of the crisis calls occurring, we are in the Ninish percentage of those encounters that end in arrest.",59,,
654,0.97,5302.363,5321.149,We are really looking for alternatives and not taking a traditional law enforcement response to individual experiencing behavioral health issues but trying to Reconnect them to those other services.,59,,
655,0.97,5321.149,5323.685,"Additional resources, accesses, I can't say enough.",59,,
656,0.97,5323.685,5326.721,Thank you to our partners and Stakeholders out there.,59,,
657,0.97,5326.721,5346.307,"It doesn't matter the amount of training or bodies that we get, if we don't have the partners to be able to connect folks back to, you get traditional response of take someone to the hospital, take them to jail, or walk away.",59,,
658,0.97,5346.307,5353.381,"That's not good for the individual, being able to connect them back to services.",59,,
659,0.97,5353.381,5364.325,We can't have success unless we have tremendous partners that many of them here are joining us today.,59,,
660,0.97,5364.325,5365.393,Thank you.,60,,
661,0.97,5365.393,5368.396,Folks from health 1.,60,,
662,0.97,5368.396,5368.896,Sure.,61,,
663,0.97,5368.896,5376.037,"I really want to emphasize what Tiarra, Brandi, and the lieutenant said.",61,,
664,0.97,5376.037,5381.843,I think I would float this on two.,61,,
665,0.97,5381.843,5396.591,"The first is like with resource connections, particularly what are brick and mortar locations, where can we take someone that's not jail, Ed.",61,,
666,0.97,5396.591,5402.463,What comes to mind is the crisis solution center but obviously their capacity is limited.,61,,
667,0.97,5402.463,5416.878,We would like more resources like that and particularly more walk in primary care and urgent care clinics that operate on Fqhc model where they take any patient regardless of ability to pay.,61,,
668,0.97,5416.878,5426.02,It is difficult for us no you to connect people with compounding medical resources.,61,,
669,0.97,5426.02,5429.524,Community health centers have no availability.,61,,
670,0.97,5429.524,5437.131,We are cautiously optimistic for Desc's new clinic they're opening.,61,,
671,0.97,5437.131,5442.904,We really I think need more of that.,61,,
672,0.97,5442.904,5472.066,"Day centers, psychiatric urgent care facilities, anything where we can get wrap around Holistic care, the other one, starting to think about what would be a 911 or next year 988 dispatch able civilian for quality of life issues, for things where we don't necessarily need SPD patrol unit or Sfd fire truck to come.",61,,
673,0.97,5472.066,5477.038,I think we have seen clearly that the model is Do-Able.,61,,
674,0.97,5477.038,5478.272,I don't think it is theoretical.,61,,
675,0.97,5478.272,5490.484,"I think it can be done safely and effectively and you get a continuum of care basically starting with community partners through fire, police, Responder models.",61,,
676,0.97,5490.484,5497.458,"I think from what we have heard on our end, there is quite a bit of interest in that in the community.",61,,
677,0.97,5497.458,5510.171,"I think the really exciting opportunities for resources such as lead, Desc, reach and perhaps more local geographic resources before you even get to the uniforms of police and fire.",61,,
678,0.97,5510.171,5516.777,I think that is certainly Aspirational but I would certainly like to see that at some point in Seattle.,61,,
679,0.97,5516.777,5517.078,Thank you.,61,,
680,0.97,5517.078,5517.445,Thank you.,62,,
681,0.97,5517.445,5521.716,I think that's a good Segway to crisis connections.,62,,
682,0.97,5521.716,5526.387,Maybe you can talk a little bit about the future of 988.,62,,
683,0.97,5526.387,5557.385,"I want to again, for the viewing public, because of the gaps we are talking about right now, if somebody in the public wants to call somebody and wants to know for certain that a uniformed police officer is not going to come because there is no guarantee health one will be able to go, unless it is flagged in a particular way that results in 911 sending health one.",62,,
684,0.97,5557.385,5569.463,There is no guarantee that crisis response unit with mental health professionals is going to go because of the capacity issues that we have heard from Lieutenant Pisconski.,62,,
685,0.97,5569.463,5583.744,For folks who want to call somebody and be guaranteed they're not going to get a response of police officers rights now crisis connections is what we have to offer.,62,,
686,0.97,5583.744,5597.792,So that's why I am also excited to hear a little bit more about how the system is going to grow with 988.,62,,
687,0.97,5597.792,5613.641,"I really don't want to give the impression that because we are talking about all of these different crisis response systems that--the foundation of the conversation is about the gaps, what's missing.",62,,
688,0.97,5613.641,5638.699,"The article that I read from earlier said in their analysis, and this is just 911 calls, doesn't count instances where 911 isn't called, but in analysis of 911 calls, 38% could benefit from alternative community response.",62,,
689,0.97,5638.699,5649.51,"Again, that says to me that there is a lot of growing that needs to be done in the system.",62,,
690,0.97,5649.51,5651.712,988 is a very large topic.,63,,
691,0.97,5651.712,5654.982,"If you don't mind, I will answer your first question.",63,,
692,0.97,5654.982,5658.019,Were do we see the gaps?,63,,
693,0.97,5658.019,5666.394,One of the things that the one called pilot taught us is there is room for crisis connection working close with law enforcement.,63,,
694,0.97,5666.394,5667.862,We found that to be effective.,63,,
695,0.97,5667.862,5670.731,We think we can do more.,63,,
696,0.97,5670.731,5689.417,"We are worried about funding for the program running out and making sure law enforcement has this as resource, that they know how to get in touch with us and how to interact with folks with a behavioral or mental health crisis.",63,,
697,0.97,5689.417,5691.118,"We want kind, compassionate, accurate response.",63,,
698,0.97,5691.118,5695.89,We don't expect cops to be social workers or expect social workers to be cops.,63,,
699,0.97,5695.89,5702.53,There is a bridge where we can help navigate those better and I think one call is a good opportunity.,63,,
700,0.97,5702.53,5709.97,"In relation to 988, one of the things crisis connections does that I didn't touch on earlier is we are a life line center.",63,,
701,0.97,5709.97,5715.076,There is national suicide prevention life line.,63,,
702,0.97,5715.076,5717.478,It's a 1-800 number.,63,,
703,0.97,5717.478,5722.183,That comes down to local contact.,63,,
704,0.97,5722.183,5722.75,Crisis connection is one.,63,,
705,0.97,5722.75,5728.155,We anticipate we will continue to be in the network of providers Longterm.,63,,
706,0.97,5728.155,5732.626,988 is the transition from the 1-800 number to a three digit number.,63,,
707,0.97,5732.626,5744.505,It's Federal law and will be out in July of 2022.,63,,
708,0.97,5744.505,5750.811,About 400 days until this goes live.,63,,
709,0.97,5750.811,5754.548,The legislature also passed a bill 1477 that puts funding into the system.,63,,
710,0.97,5754.548,5757.218,Thank you to anyone who advocated on that.,63,,
711,0.97,5757.218,5759.82,Great job.,63,,
712,0.97,5759.82,5768.863,It will help with increasing community response side of things with mobile crisis teams and will more funding into the system for contacts and their hubs.,63,,
713,0.97,5768.863,5771.365,One will likely be crisis connections.,63,,
714,0.97,5771.365,5773.367,It will enable bed tracking.,63,,
715,0.97,5773.367,5782.91,It will enable tracking live of mobile crisis to communities so we can get them dispatched to most appropriate local crisis team out there.,63,,
716,0.97,5782.91,5799.693,"It's going to require a lot of system upgrades, a lot of upgrades to technology, increases to staff, trying to build a system that is designed in a way to get people out of 911 system and behavioral health response system.",63,,
717,0.97,5799.693,5808.869,"Our life line contract has been funded about $1,500 a year which is just, you can't operate on that.",63,,
718,0.97,5808.869,5810.771,That's not a life line's fault.,63,,
719,0.97,5810.771,5813.04,There just wasn't funding in the system.,63,,
720,0.97,5813.04,5828.455,This is long overdue and we are looking forward to the scope of work so we can respond to anyone who needs it.,63,,
721,0.97,5828.455,5829.857,"Thank you, Neil.",64,,
722,0.97,5829.857,5839.133,"Looking at the panel including Council members, are there questions we want to ask of panelists?",64,,
723,0.97,5839.133,5844.338,Are there closing thoughts panelists want to make sure that we touch upon?,64,,
724,0.97,5844.338,5849.41,"Again, this is a really big conversation.",64,,
725,0.97,5849.41,5868.529,I am really appreciative that we have the time today but I think it is one of many conversations that we need to continue having before we get recommendations resulting from the executive work.,64,,
726,0.97,5868.529,5873.734,I did have one thing to add that I can't emphasize enough.,65,,
727,0.97,5873.734,5886.013,"In creating alternative line, if we don't think about the nuance of crime and behavioral health, it could be detrimental to communities of color, in particular black communities.",65,,
728,0.97,5886.013,5899.126,"If I don't lay anything else down for people to pay attention to, how we are going to serve the population that are committing crimes, significant trauma and behavioral health.",65,,
729,0.97,5899.126,5910.471,We don't want them to be dealt with a heavy hand.,65,,
730,0.97,5910.471,5912.306,"Thank you, Brandie.",66,,
731,0.97,5912.306,5912.806,Councilmember Morales.,66,,
732,0.97,5912.806,5913.173,Thank you.,67,,
733,0.97,5913.173,5916.844,I want to thank everybody for sharing this information with us.,67,,
734,0.97,5916.844,5922.983,I don't think any of this is a surprise.,67,,
735,0.97,5922.983,5925.586,We know across the city we've got a lot of need.,67,,
736,0.97,5925.586,5931.592,I want to respond to what Tiarra and Brandie were saying.,67,,
737,0.97,5931.592,5941.602,I have called lead often to come to different neighborhoods in my district.,67,,
738,0.97,5941.602,5943.637,Constituents across South Seattle have been asking for support.,67,,
739,0.97,5943.637,5951.612,They don't want to call the police but there are more and more people who are engaging in drugs.,67,,
740,0.97,5951.612,5955.749,We find bullets under Mount Baker light rail station.,67,,
741,0.97,5955.749,5963.824,We know there are lots of challenges that our community members have.,67,,
742,0.97,5963.824,5968.429,And the reality is that these providers are tapped out.,67,,
743,0.97,5968.429,5981.809,Tiarra was kind enough to meet with some of the constituents in the area but also had to say we just can't come back to provide the kind of service we would like to do.,67,,
744,0.97,5981.809,5989.75,"I think it is important that we acknowledge this, as somebody was saying, continuum of care is really important.",67,,
745,0.97,5989.75,6012.606,"We know we need to get more housing in place but also know that people need help desperately and I think as a city, it is our obligation to provide resources that we need so our neighbors are cared for, whether it is from their own private medical provider or from emergency response providers like you folks.",67,,
746,0.97,6012.606,6014.341,Thank you for what you do.,67,,
747,0.97,6014.341,6027.821,I just want to say we hear you and know that you need more support in order to do your work better.,67,,
748,0.97,6027.821,6028.355,Councilmember Lewis.,68,,
749,0.97,6028.355,6031.859,"Thank you, Madam chair.",69,,
750,0.97,6031.859,6033.761,I really appreciate having this conversation.,69,,
751,0.97,6033.761,6046.74,"Regardless of where we are having it, be it in the public safety Committee, select Committee on homelessness, all roads lead to some of the same systems analyses, questions.",69,,
752,0.97,6046.74,6081.508,"I want to flag, not a question, just a comment on our conversation today for strategic planning going forward and how we build and design a new system to accommodate the need that we see when we are out in the city and from the constituents that we hear from as Council members, that we need to think of Proactive community building work that lead has been doing as a leg of the stool of our overall system of public safety.",69,,
753,0.97,6081.508,6088.115,I think historically there has been this tendency to really sort of limit it.,69,,
754,0.97,6088.115,6089.95,There is the fire Department.,69,,
755,0.97,6089.95,6092.219,There is the police.,69,,
756,0.97,6092.219,6092.886,There are hospitals.,69,,
757,0.97,6092.886,6106.166,Then things like lead are these peripheral sort of niche plans on the side lines of some of these systems.,69,,
758,0.97,6106.166,6125.786,"What's clear here to build on the work that Council has charted out is lead should be Resourced and planned around as full leg of our public safety chair, stool, whatever analogy you want to use.",69,,
759,0.97,6125.786,6135.128,"It is indispensable, independent, Proactive component of this work that causes a lot of downstream benefits when it is adequately scaled and Resourced.",69,,
760,0.97,6135.128,6146.507,I think we need to look into making that or continuing work as a Council to build that as a standing budget priority.,69,,
761,0.97,6146.507,6170.931,"From what I have heard from provider partners that is something that will be outcome determine touch for capacity building and for getting through the constant refrain we have heard which is if we have to scramble for our money every budget cycle every single year, we can't focus on work and focus on building capacity.",69,,
762,0.97,6170.931,6194.288,"That is something we need to be investing in to be sure that that leg of the stool isn't wobbly, that it is strong, that we can depend on it and that it will have benefits for all the other actors doing emergency response because they're just responding to less need in the community because we have dealt with it up stream in a Proactive culturally competent way.",69,,
763,0.97,6194.288,6208.168,I really appreciate what everyone shared today and look forward to continuing that work to make sure folks have the support they need to be successful.,69,,
764,0.97,6208.168,6209.303,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,70,,
765,0.97,6209.303,6213.106,"Yes, this is part of an ongoing discussion.",70,,
766,0.97,6213.106,6253.447,"I think Foundational to the discussion as Councilmember Lewis said is to consider the folks we have here as parts of continuum, as part of a continuum that we need to adequately resource in order to adjust the needs but also in adequately looking at ways to Operationalize what we are Resourcing in a way that addresses Gatessest needs of those who have been poorly served by the current system.",70,,
767,0.97,6253.447,6268.061,I appreciate everybody being with us today as well as your important work on behalf of people who need your help.,70,,
768,0.97,6268.061,6270.831,Thank you so much.,70,,
769,0.97,6270.831,6271.131,All right.,70,,
770,0.97,6271.131,6277.437,"Moving on, clerk, can you read the item into the agenda.",70,,
771,0.97,6277.437,6280.941,2021 Seattle all hazards mitigation plan.,71,,
772,0.97,6280.941,6283.577,"Thank you, Alex.",72,,
773,0.97,6283.577,6287.214,We are joined today by the office of emergency management.,72,,
774,0.97,6287.214,6296.657,"We are going to do a light touch on this because this panel will be back before this Committee, I believe at the next meeting.",72,,
775,0.97,6296.657,6313.573,So we will hear from curry Mayer to do a quick briefing of what's in the plan and what we can expect coming back to us in a subsequent meeting.,72,,
776,0.97,6313.573,6313.84,Okay.,73,,
777,0.97,6313.84,6314.174,Thank you.,73,,
778,0.97,6314.174,6325.986,Thank you committee chair and Council person Herbold for having me and also to the rest of the committee members for your interest in the hazard mitigation plan.,73,,
779,0.97,6325.986,6328.755,I am about to share my screen here.,73,,
780,0.97,6328.755,6331.892,I just have a few slides to share with you today.,73,,
781,0.97,6331.892,6333.727,So I will bring that up.,73,,
782,0.97,6333.727,6353.447,But I wanted to say in the meantime also that the development of the plan is really due to my team members and most especially Erica Lund who is the expert on the plan.,73,,
783,0.97,6353.447,6354.114,She's here today.,73,,
784,0.97,6354.114,6361.988,I wanted to give a shout out and Kudos and congratulations to Erika Lund.,73,,
785,0.97,6361.988,6369.663,"This is a really important plan hopefully, you can see my screen.",73,,
786,0.97,6369.663,6371.431,"Yes, we can.",74,,
787,0.97,6371.431,6371.798,Good.,75,,
788,0.97,6371.798,6383.81,Hazard mitigation plan is a very large comprehensive document that gives all kinds of detailed information first of all about the types of hazards that we face in Seattle.,75,,
789,0.97,6383.81,6392.686,So we have something called a hazard impact and vulnerability assessment.,75,,
790,0.97,6392.686,6400.46,It looks at all the hazards we might face and then what are the actions we can take to mitigate those?,75,,
791,0.97,6400.46,6413.14,"It's shown time and time again that the more you invest in mitigation in terms of action, the more money you save in response or when there is some kind of incident impact.",75,,
792,0.97,6413.14,6420.58,We are always looking for one of those things we can do up front in addition to making the community safer.,75,,
793,0.97,6420.58,6423.55,There were many departments engaged in this work.,75,,
794,0.97,6423.55,6431.291,"It also coordinates with a number of other city wide plans and also codes, funding levees.",75,,
795,0.97,6431.291,6436.73,Also there is evolving information on Community-Led investments in this update.,75,,
796,0.97,6436.73,6451.812,"We have also adjusted criteria to reflect values for the Rsji initiatives, collaboration with the community, what Resonates best with them, and also other benefits that I will highlight for you here.",75,,
797,0.97,6451.812,6480.54,"It is also important to note that the process for this is that once we get community input and look at how we are best serving and actually mitigating hazards in Seattle to the best of our ability, then it goes to the Mayor and she has reviewed and approved it and then here to all of you Council, it will soon be Uploaded into the Database and it will go to the state and ultimately to FEMA.",75,,
798,0.97,6480.54,6497.357,It is important that it go to FEMA because we are eligible as a city to apply for additional grants and will actually receive more money if we have an approved hazard mitigation plan.,75,,
799,0.97,6497.357,6501.661,What do we plan to do in the future?,75,,
800,0.97,6501.661,6508.802,"Well, there are 47 mitigation projects in the updated version of the plan.",75,,
801,0.97,6508.802,6526.219,"We are looking at implementing recommendations from past studies, especially more seismic retrofitting of all kinds of structures here in Seattle, bridges, dams, reservoirs, retaining walls, historic libraries.",75,,
802,0.97,6526.219,6539.299,Then also as I mentioned we are integrating hazard mitigation policies into our next comprehensive plan update which has roles and responsibilities for all the departments within the city.,75,,
803,0.97,6539.299,6555.548,We are also looking at designing some infrastructure to protect from sea level rise and engaging the community and what does that look like and how can we best safeguard their community.,75,,
804,0.97,6555.548,6572.499,"We are looking at replacing retaining wall on North Gateway and as I mentioned, seismic upgrades are always a big topic that I know you are all very aware of.",75,,
805,0.97,6572.499,6578.872,"Also, it is important to get community input on the plan and we are still doing some of that now as we speak.",75,,
806,0.97,6578.872,6590.05,Some of the results we got back show that earthquakes are hazard of greatest concern which is not a surprise to anyone.,75,,
807,0.97,6590.05,6601.962,One of the things we look at when doing our planning in exercising and training with earthquakes is there is always Cascade of other types of events that occur because of the earthquake.,75,,
808,0.97,6601.962,6613.239,"When you talk about earthquake, you are not really just looking at the one hazard but all the other things that happen as a result of the earthquake.",75,,
809,0.97,6613.239,6625.018,"Power outages, fires, blocked roadways which impacts response vehicles, all those kinds of Tings, will come out when we start doing planning and looking at what happens after earthquakes.",75,,
810,0.97,6625.018,6653.346,"The community was most concerned with how are we protecting critical facilities, facilities that support health and mental health in particular, homeless and emergency shelters for everybody, food banks and also of course affordable housing and which of the housing units are more vulnerable to disaster as we take a look at that as well.",75,,
811,0.97,6653.346,6657.484,"So to date, I know this is a little hard to see, but you will get a copy.",75,,
812,0.97,6657.484,6661.921,So you will have the details in front of you.,75,,
813,0.97,6661.921,6666.126,These are the projects that we have already engaged in.,75,,
814,0.97,6666.126,6682.242,Lead Department for each of the projects and the principle beneficiaries in terms of organizations or departments from Seattle.,75,,
815,0.97,6682.242,6689.215,We have been awarded excess of $23 million in Federal funding for projects and planning.,75,,
816,0.97,6689.215,6697.757,We have three applications pending that are related to seismic retrofitting and that will total another $21 million.,75,,
817,0.97,6697.757,6712.005,"As you can imagine, we are very proud of this effort and it really makes a difference for a lot of segments of our community.",75,,
818,0.97,6712.005,6733.66,"Next steps as I mentioned is for you to approve, Council to have their approval once you have had a chance to look at it in addition to my briefing here and then it will go to the state emergency management division and then of course onto FEMA for official approval.",75,,
819,0.97,6733.66,6744.537,I just wanted to give you a brief idea of how many different departments across the city have been involved in the effort.,75,,
820,0.97,6744.537,6745.972,It is a city wide effort.,75,,
821,0.97,6745.972,6750.343,As you see all the different groups and departments involved in this work.,75,,
822,0.97,6750.343,6772.132,"That helps us make sure that we reach community members in different areas and with different needs across the city, so we do the best job of making a comprehensive plan that will do the most good for the most people.",75,,
823,0.97,6772.132,6774.434,That is the end of my overview.,75,,
824,0.97,6774.434,6787.213,"So I am happy to take questions and then also as I mentioned, Erika is also here if you have more specific.",75,,
825,0.97,6787.213,6788.214,Thank you.,76,,
826,0.97,6788.214,6788.681,Councilman Morales.,76,,
827,0.97,6788.681,6789.048,Thank you.,77,,
828,0.97,6789.048,6791.985,I am interested in the earthquake slide.,77,,
829,0.97,6791.985,6810.57,"As a city surrounded by water and bridges that would very Liely collapse and knowing that in any given grocery store, there might be three days worth of food, can you tell us what the plan is?",77,,
830,0.97,6810.57,6816.309,We have all been told that preparing for three days on your own is not nearly sufficient.,77,,
831,0.97,6816.309,6825.385,We should be planning to be on our own for two weeks in the event of an earthquake because crisis response folks will be dealing with the crisis.,77,,
832,0.97,6825.385,6830.29,So we need food and water and all of that for two weeks.,77,,
833,0.97,6830.29,6830.557,Yeah.,78,,
834,0.97,6830.557,6834.494,And grocery stores don't carry that much food.,79,,
835,0.97,6834.494,6835.161,What's the plan?,79,,
836,0.97,6835.161,6838.731,I can highlight a couple things.,80,,
837,0.97,6838.731,6843.837,"First, Kudos to you for knowing that.",80,,
838,0.97,6843.837,6844.27,I appreciate that.,80,,
839,0.97,6844.27,6844.637,That's great.,80,,
840,0.97,6844.637,6850.443,Also you can help with making sure the community knows three days is not enough.,80,,
841,0.97,6850.443,6873.266,"The good news about us being close to the water is that unlike if we were at the open ocean where there would be a tsunami, because we are a little bit protected by the sound, we will have water damage and high waves and what not but we will not have tsunami that directly impacts city of Seattle.",80,,
842,0.97,6873.266,6873.766,So that's good.,80,,
843,0.97,6873.766,6882.775,One of the recent things we are doing to look at how do we help people with areas of the city that are cut off from one another?,80,,
844,0.97,6882.775,6888.581,We are looking at the concept called Islanding.,80,,
845,0.97,6888.581,6903.296,"Because of the natural disaster of the earthquake, the ways that that damage cuts off sections of the city because the freeway collapsed here or you can't go over this bridge.",80,,
846,0.97,6903.296,6908.268,"So they'll be individual Islands, not Islands surrounded by water but cut off from other areas of the city.",80,,
847,0.97,6908.268,6910.603,We are looking at a number of things.,80,,
848,0.97,6910.603,6915.508,"This is brand new, so we are still in the early planning stages.",80,,
849,0.97,6915.508,6919.545,"One, helping the community understand what does that look like?",80,,
850,0.97,6919.545,6927.854,Of course we can't say how the damage will be but we can have a pretty good idea.,80,,
851,0.97,6927.854,6930.99,We know where freeway over passes and what not are.,80,,
852,0.97,6930.99,6940.133,Looking at how we can strategically preposition City resources so they can help in places that you may not be able to drive to another section of the city.,80,,
853,0.97,6940.133,6940.566,That's one part.,80,,
854,0.97,6940.566,6946.706,We are doing that with city departments.,80,,
855,0.97,6946.706,6958.117,Then also helping the community understand and connecting with community efforts working on preparedness or communications.,80,,
856,0.97,6958.117,6971.698,"We can say this is likely to be your new neighborhood based on the damage of the earthquake, what are things you as a community can do to help each other while you are still disconnected?",80,,
857,0.97,6971.698,6975.401,So we are just starting to look at that.,80,,
858,0.97,6975.401,6993.586,"We are talking with other office of emergency management talking with others about what are best ways we can mitigate this, knowing where fire departments are, so they can as many hubs, not fire departments, where the fire stations are.",80,,
859,0.97,6993.586,6997.29,So if those could be mini hubs.,80,,
860,0.97,6997.29,7008.368,"What other resources are already in the areas and what do we need to store, either supplies, shelter capacity, shelter supplies, those kind of things.",80,,
861,0.97,7008.368,7009.602,That effort is underway now.,80,,
862,0.97,7009.602,7031.357,The other thing we are doing is helping First City departments and teams understand if you had to respond after earthquake or help the city in some way based on your job how would you get here without crossing a bridge or without crossing a body of water?,80,,
863,0.97,7031.357,7032.492,It is not impossible.,80,,
864,0.97,7032.492,7034.494,It will take people longer.,80,,
865,0.97,7034.494,7036.162,But it is not impossible.,80,,
866,0.97,7036.162,7048.574,We are also looking at the ways we will communicate post earthquake so we make sure we get Situational awareness and make sure we can get help to the most people as quickly as possible.,80,,
867,0.97,7048.574,7058.484,So a number of those efforts in the earthquake planning area are underway right now.,80,,
868,0.97,7058.484,7066.492,"It's been really exciting, I will say it like that, for me to pivot and focus on earthquakes instead of just talking about Covid.",80,,
869,0.97,7066.492,7068.761,So we are very engaged in the work.,80,,
870,0.97,7068.761,7079.105,"If you have other suggestions or want to help with community Outreachand getting the community to understand other things we are doing, I would really appreciate that.",80,,
871,0.97,7079.105,7090.349,"Can you, high level, explain the difference between all hazards mitigation plan and earthquake preparedness plan?",81,,
872,0.97,7090.349,7090.716,"Yes, sure.",82,,
873,0.97,7090.716,7104.33,All hazard mitigation plan looks at all of those hazards that Seattle may be vulnerable to.,82,,
874,0.97,7104.33,7105.164,And we rank them.,82,,
875,0.97,7105.164,7109.202,Earthquake plan is all about earthquakes.,82,,
876,0.97,7109.202,7122.348,"While other hazards may also happen as a result of the earthquake, there are Peculiars for other types of hazards that may not be included in earthquake an ex which focuses on that.",82,,
877,0.97,7122.348,7133.392,"This is more comprehensive, ranks hazards, and ties actions to those particular hazards.",82,,
878,0.97,7133.392,7139.665,Thank you for that.,83,,
879,0.97,7139.665,7140.199,Appreciate that.,83,,
880,0.97,7140.199,7140.933,Other hands raised?,83,,
881,0.97,7140.933,7146.873,Can you let us know when we can expect to receive the resolution and draft plan?,83,,
882,0.97,7146.873,7151.144,We really appreciate you being here to give us a preview.,83,,
883,0.97,7151.144,7152.211,You bet.,84,,
884,0.97,7152.211,7152.545,Of course.,84,,
885,0.97,7152.545,7154.413,It should be shortly.,84,,
886,0.97,7154.413,7159.218,"I don't know, Erika, if you have a better idea of the time frame.",84,,
887,0.97,7159.218,7166.259,It was approved by the Mayor a little while ago.,84,,
888,0.97,7166.259,7171.03,So my understanding is it is with the city attorneys office now.,84,,
889,0.97,7171.03,7172.131,That's my understanding.,85,,
890,0.97,7172.131,7174.901,We did draft resolution and sent that on.,85,,
891,0.97,7174.901,7180.206,So I think it's just still in process.,85,,
892,0.97,7180.206,7181.207,Great.,86,,
893,0.97,7181.207,7182.341,Thank you so much.,86,,
894,0.97,7182.341,7238.097,"I want to flag here that as part of the adoption of the all hazards mitigation plan, I really appreciate director Mayer, your willingness to speak to a group of Georgetown residents who are really interested in ensuring that there is engagement with that community around potential hazards associated with potential airplane crashes, jet crashes and maybe looking for some way to lift up their aspirations that OEM do work with the community in an evident to mitigate their concerns and potential impacts of hazards that that community experiences.",86,,
895,0.97,7238.097,7240.833,I am happy to do that.,87,,
896,0.97,7240.833,7251.01,I am meeting with King County airport division director today to talk about things we can do to specifically help Georgetown.,87,,
897,0.97,7251.01,7252.812,Really appreciate that.,88,,
898,0.97,7252.812,7254.113,"Yeah, you bet.",89,,
899,0.97,7254.113,7264.323,"Not seeing any questions, we'll see you again soon for the Council's action or this Committee's action on the plan.",90,,
900,0.97,7264.323,7266.259,Really appreciate your time giving us a preview.,90,,
901,0.97,7266.259,7266.659,You bet.,91,,
902,0.97,7266.659,7269.462,Thank you so much for having me.,91,,
903,0.97,7269.462,7275.468,And Kudos to all of you for looking at mental health issues.,91,,
904,0.97,7275.468,7275.868,That's admirable.,91,,
905,0.97,7275.868,7281.807,"I have some of that in my family, so I really appreciate that you are taking a look.",91,,
906,0.97,7281.807,7282.208,That's awesome.,91,,
907,0.97,7282.208,7295.154,"A lot of people are looking for alternatives to 911 response for those issues, people who have loved ones and friends in the community.",92,,
908,0.97,7295.154,7301.227,Appreciate that perspective from you as well.,92,,
909,0.97,7301.227,7303.162,Thank you.,93,,
910,0.97,7303.162,7303.462,Take care.,93,,
911,0.97,7303.462,7303.663,Bye.,93,,
912,0.97,7303.663,7304.83,All right.,94,,
913,0.97,7304.83,7313.372,Can we read final item of the agenda.,94,,
914,0.97,7313.372,7315.775,Criminal legal system strategic plan.,95,,
915,0.97,7315.775,7316.142,Thank you.,96,,
916,0.97,7316.142,7328.32,"With that, we will hand it over to Carlos Lugo with Council central staff just as some opening remarks.",96,,
917,0.97,7328.32,7359.685,"This item is a presentation on the criminal legal system alignment as part of the 2019 budget under leadership of Council President Gonzalez, actions to fund a term limited position in our Department and also a permanent position in the office of civil rights so we can coordinate Stakeholder engagement around to Realign criminal legal system.",96,,
918,0.97,7359.685,7374.8,"The action requested a strategic plan, implement recommendations that have already been provided to city about the criminal legal system in order to reduce harm cautioned by criminal legal system and people and communities who interact with it.",96,,
919,0.97,7374.8,7387.046,The strategic plan is one of two that we expect from this body of work.,96,,
920,0.97,7387.046,7390.95,The second is a report.,96,,
921,0.97,7390.95,7395.054,A Workgroup comprised of 9 community members impacted by the city's legal system.,96,,
922,0.97,7395.054,7404.263,"Over the last year they've met regularly deemed by Council central staff and office for civil rights, recommendations for criminal legal system alignment.",96,,
923,0.97,7404.263,7418.911,We are in communication with office of civil rights and members of the Workgroup about the report and understand that the task force is in the process of finalizing the report.,96,,
924,0.97,7418.911,7419.245,Itnot ready.,96,,
925,0.97,7419.245,7427.186,"When it is ready, I hope that we can have them present it in council as well.",96,,
926,0.97,7427.186,7432.691,"With that, we'll hand it over to Carlos.",96,,
927,0.97,7432.691,7435.227,"Thank you Madam chair, members of the committee.",97,,
928,0.97,7435.227,7447.54,I start off by saying I am very excited to be presenting for this culmination of two years of work.,97,,
929,0.97,7447.54,7449.842,Thank you for the opportunity.,97,,
930,0.97,7449.842,7452.511,I am Carlos Lugo with Council central staff.,97,,
931,0.97,7452.511,7470.429,Let me share my screen and we can get started here.,97,,
932,0.97,7470.429,7474.533,I am presenting on realigning through public health approach.,97,,
933,0.97,7474.533,7494.82,"This is culmination of two years of work which comprised Councilmember Herbold as you said, a mixture of not only academic analysis and academic deep dive which I am presenting but also partnership with office of civil rights to engage community members that have been impacted by the system.",97,,
934,0.97,7494.82,7499.725,What I present today focuses more on the academic piece.,97,,
935,0.97,7499.725,7504.864,"As you mentioned, the Workgroup itself will be presenting their recommendations with once that report is ready.",97,,
936,0.97,7504.864,7536.529,"To give you a little background as to my approach, I really started off with the idea of making sure that I was not only responsive to what Council asked in the Council budget actions that created this position in terms of looking at previously made recommendations that had been given to the city Terning criminal legal system but also with the idea that we have had engagements with community members for the past eight to ten years specifically looking at different aspects of the criminal legal system.",97,,
937,0.97,7536.529,7545.504,This project started off with looking at what has been pulled to us as the city over the past eight to ten years by community members.,97,,
938,0.97,7545.504,7553.312,"Starting that, I started really looking at specific questions that I wanted answered related to this realignment project.",97,,
939,0.97,7553.312,7570.396,"So going through a review of the eight to ten years of criminal legal system engagement reports, King County reports, community produced documents concerning criminal legal system realignment, I was able to go through and find answers responsive to the starting questions I had.",97,,
940,0.97,7570.396,7584.944,"Being able to then group the questions into one document really gave us a clear picture of what were the Reoccurring themes that community has told us as the city, county over and over again over eight to ten years.",97,,
941,0.97,7584.944,7590.716,Pulling those out and being able to compile them I created community's guiding principles.,97,,
942,0.97,7590.716,7591.684,These really were that.,97,,
943,0.97,7591.684,7609.435,"They were the guard rails to the rest of the research I did, really the guiding Star if you will, as this realignment project developed and evolved.",97,,
944,0.97,7609.435,7613.105,"As you mentioned Councilmember Herbold, will also be presenting findings.",97,,
945,0.97,7613.105,7620.145,I won't touch upon this too much because of course their report will have more information and more detail as to the process as well as outcomes.,97,,
946,0.97,7620.145,7632.625,I will go right into the academic and sits part--analysis part.,97,,
947,0.97,7632.625,7656.882,"Using those guiding principles, I went in and did a lot of research as to best practices, talked to criminal legal experts across the country, really tried to figure out what were models, what were theories in criminal justice that were responsive to what community has told us through community guiding principles.",97,,
948,0.97,7656.882,7681.24,"What I ended upcoming up with was centering on the model and really taking risks need and Responsivity model or Rnr, that ideas for specific programs used in the criminal legal system and really expanded that to Reorient the system around these Evidence-Based ideas that were in line with what community has asked us.",97,,
949,0.97,7681.24,7710.369,"What I am presenting today is a new way of using research and really expanding that from the limited capacity where it's been used before to again reorienting entire system around something that is not based on punitive measures and is backed by evidence based practice and research and again involves what community has told us, really centers that in this work.",97,,
950,0.97,7710.369,7735.661,"The Rnr model in short is rooted in behavioral psychology, addressing causes of crime through reduction through what researchers call Cr Iminogenic needs.",97,,
951,0.97,7735.661,7744.203,Highlighted principles within recommendations for implementing evidence based practices to reduce Recidivism.,97,,
952,0.97,7744.203,7753.378,The principle States services and Interconveniences should be matched on individuals' risk to Reoffend.,97,,
953,0.97,7753.378,7757.95,This is really for two reasons.,97,,
954,0.97,7757.95,7760.652,"One, providing services is expensive.",97,,
955,0.97,7760.652,7761.753,It is resource intensive.,97,,
956,0.97,7761.753,7773.132,Ensuring that we are targeting limited resources in a way that will make most sense is going to get the best bang for the buck.,97,,
957,0.97,7773.132,7800.359,"More importantly, research tells us when looking at applying interventions, if we end up mixing folks from different risk levels, someone that is for example has a high risk of becoming involved in the criminal legal system repeatedly and we mix programming with folks low risk it can negatively impact low risk folks and make it more likely that they will cycle through the system as well.",97,,
958,0.97,7800.359,7812.371,A lot of this is looking at how we reduce harm that the system causes while being more effective than we are now in ensuring public safety.,97,,
959,0.97,7812.371,7827.753,Need principle States intervention should focus on addressing addressing Crimon Genic needs.,97,,
960,0.97,7827.753,7832.491,I will go through those.,97,,
961,0.97,7832.491,7847.272,The specific Responsivity principle which as Rnr progressed and evolved I think really reflects a lot of the values we have talked about in Seattle concerning criminal legal system realignment in the past few years.,97,,
962,0.97,7847.272,7865.424,"Services should be in a way that should be responsive, building on strengths, reducing barriers for full participation and treatments, delivering early and often on matters of personal interest and starting where the person is at.",97,,
963,0.97,7865.424,7876.602,These are the misdemeanor risk need factors that have been identified as to what increases an individual's propensity of engaging in criminal behavior.,97,,
964,0.97,7876.602,7890.148,When that was originally created it focused on felony system that in New York they ended up doing analysis in the study of misdemeanor needs in the misdemeanor population.,97,,
965,0.97,7890.148,7896.555,"They found there was large overlap between the two with one exception, homelessness or housing insecurity.",97,,
966,0.97,7896.555,7904.93,"That was found to be very relevant to folks going into the misdemeanor system, not so much the felony system.",97,,
967,0.97,7904.93,7908.767,"Most, except for the first one, are dynamic.",97,,
968,0.97,7908.767,7909.234,The first is static.,97,,
969,0.97,7909.234,7949.775,"But the rest because they are dynamic means we as government, as a city, can apply interventions and have responses that alternatively could make things ready and reduce needs leading to folks being less likely to be involved in the legal system or a lot of times, actions that we take in our legal system can negatively impact these needs and make it more like will I that folks cycle through the system and get caught in this revolving door as we have seen particularly in a lot of high barrier individual working meetings that the Mayor had put in place a few years back.",97,,
970,0.97,7949.775,7952.577,"As an example, I will leave this here.",97,,
971,0.97,7952.577,7956.415,I don't need to read it.,97,,
972,0.97,7956.415,7974.566,"This is an example of how actions the city takes or any city working on criminal legal system issues, shows that the actions we take can negatively impact so many aspects of a person's life as they're going through the system.",97,,
973,0.97,7974.566,7975.1,This is from 2018.,97,,
974,0.97,7975.1,7985.677,It does a good job ever Encapsulating how Itthat even three days of jail can impact so many aspects of this individual's life.,97,,
975,0.97,7985.677,8001.693,"You can see ties between increased right there where talking about homelessness, jobs, relationships, potentially losing custody of their children.",97,,
976,0.97,8001.693,8004.896,How is Rnr different from traditional responses?,97,,
977,0.97,8004.896,8016.942,What's interesting to me as I mentioned is Rnr has primarily been used in prisons to look at prison type of programs for individuals that are sentenced.,97,,
978,0.97,8016.942,8026.184,"That said, there are a lot of things that this I would say fall short of in terms of what the research tells us.",97,,
979,0.97,8026.184,8036.261,"When taking someone from their family and putting them in a situation where they're in prison, in jail, away from pro social connections, we are making things worse.",97,,
980,0.97,8036.261,8051.91,"More importantly when you look at what research says and go into source material of what the authors that created the risk have said, they've highlighted that cognitive behavioral therapy and human services are more effective.",97,,
981,0.97,8051.91,8061.319,It is through human clinical social services that the major causes of crime can be addressed and Lastly that treatment is more effective in community setting than a harsher one.,97,,
982,0.97,8061.319,8077.335,"The argument I am making is Rnr is a viable model to Realign criminal legal system around, just hasn't been used appropriately in a way that has greatest amount of impact.",97,,
983,0.97,8077.335,8087.913,So the other thing that looking at the model allows us to do is we can shift the criminal legal system into one that's really based on a public health model.,97,,
984,0.97,8087.913,8096.288,This right here is recommendations or at least the process that the world health organization has used in the campaign for violence prevention.,97,,
985,0.97,8096.288,8101.66,"We'll go through these briefly but you see defining problem through information, election, analysis.",97,,
986,0.97,8101.66,8114.372,"I would argue we have largely done that at this point in the city looking at what we need to do, where are we in terms of criminal legal system?",97,,
987,0.97,8114.372,8115.807,Solutions and responses.,97,,
988,0.97,8115.807,8116.575,What are problems and shortfalls?,97,,
989,0.97,8116.575,8132.524,I would argue that the presentations earlier this morning I think did a wonder if you will job of touching on some of those issues that need to be addressed.,97,,
990,0.97,8132.524,8142.767,"Secondly, establishing why violence in W.H.O .'s case or in our case misdemeanor violence, factors that can be modified through intervention.",97,,
991,0.97,8142.767,8146.238,This is where heart of the Rnr model comes into play.,97,,
992,0.97,8146.238,8163.388,It tells us what the factors are and gives us a plan that we can use to really look at the interventions that we have to determine whether they are addressing needs in a positive way or alternatively in a negative way.,97,,
993,0.97,8163.388,8176.101,"Right now where I see us being is step three, finding out violence or misdemeanor crime by designing, intervening, evaluating interventions.",97,,
994,0.97,8176.101,8182.407,That's what I am attempting to do with this as well as the larger work.,97,,
995,0.97,8182.407,8186.678,Monitoring and evaluating impact on the risk factors.,97,,
996,0.97,8186.678,8200.492,"As we are shift Toga public health model, there are other public health tools that we can use to design these interventions and make sure they're appropriately targeting individuals at appropriate places in the criminal legal system.",97,,
997,0.97,8200.492,8212.27,"What I am showing here at the top of the screen, this model was originally created to look at the points of Interception.",97,,
998,0.97,8212.27,8214.406,It's why it is intercept model.,97,,
999,0.97,8214.406,8220.245,"Folks suffering from mental health or substance use disorder, go through the criminal legal system.",97,,
1000,0.97,8220.245,8237.362,"Each of the points of Interception, the idea is they are opportunities to create off ramps so we can have people from the more punitive system in to actually address causes that brought them into the system to begin with in a Nonpunitive type of way.",97,,
1001,0.97,8237.362,8249.708,Úin this report what I focused on is intercept one which is initial interaction with law enforcement or 911 system.,97,,
1002,0.97,8249.708,8254.646,Intercept 2 is initial court hearings and conclude talking about intercept zero.,97,,
1003,0.97,8254.646,8262.287,There is a reason and I will get to it later in the presentation.,97,,
1004,0.97,8262.287,8274.833,"In terms of Intercepting recommendations, what I am looking at is increasing and certainly there are more that the city council invested in over the course of the past few years.",97,,
1005,0.97,8274.833,8279.237,This morning I think we heard about some fantastic programming.,97,,
1006,0.97,8279.237,8290.649,The other portion is in making sure we are updating emergency dispatch protocol so we can expand use of alternative responses.,97,,
1007,0.97,8290.649,8302.36,Seattle police Department through Seattle police officers Guild collective bargaining agreement with the city quote Unquote owns body of work related to behavioral health crises.,97,,
1008,0.97,8302.36,8328.019,"This means if someone calls 911 and requests assistance for someone suffering from an episode because Seattle police Department owns that body of work, they are likely to be the first responders there which we flow can lead to unfortunate incidences and even death of folks experiencing behavioral health crises.",97,,
1009,0.97,8328.019,8340.632,Being able to expand use of alternatives would allow the city to be able to make the best use of the investments they have made.,97,,
1010,0.97,8340.632,8344.135,"Secondly, looking at policing practices.",97,,
1011,0.97,8344.135,8349.04,This addresses recommendations made not only by the city's Reentry Workgroup.,97,,
1012,0.97,8349.04,8352.577,This is one of their top recommendations.,97,,
1013,0.97,8352.577,8367.826,"But also as I mentioned, guiding principles talks about this a lot, this is in line with President Obama's Commission on 21st century policing which also recommended that we look at applying alternatives such as summons for arrests for misdemeanor crimes.",97,,
1014,0.97,8367.826,8396.521,As an example what I can highlight is city of New Orleans in 2008 passed ordinance through city council which essentially mandates officers use arrest alternatives for most cases except where there is a situation where the officer feels it is absolutely necessary.,97,,
1015,0.97,8396.521,8405.663,The officer would need to be able to list the reasons why it is that circumstance warranted arrest verses alternative.,97,,
1016,0.97,8405.663,8423.114,This really looks at in intercept 1 what we can do to reduce the harm that the system causes by not negatively Impacting these Crimino Genic needs that we talked about.,97,,
1017,0.97,8423.114,8430.955,"In intercept 2, recommendations I put forward in my report are focused on two aspects.",97,,
1018,0.97,8430.955,8435.96,One is pretrial detention and second is in diversion.,97,,
1019,0.97,8435.96,8454.412,"The first with pretrial Detention, we know pretrial detention through the use of cash fail system not only disproportionately impacts individuals from the communities but also has Inferiorness in it because bail isn't cash bail.",97,,
1020,0.97,8454.412,8459.384,It relies on a person's ability to pay to be able to be released.,97,,
1021,0.97,8459.384,8472.597,So this would really again go to the heart of how do we reduce harm that the system causes through punitive measures.,97,,
1022,0.97,8472.597,8475.467,Recommendations promote community based pretrial release.,97,,
1023,0.97,8475.467,8484.075,"This was previously recommended by bail reform group which Councilmember Herbold, I believe that was one of your initiatives.",97,,
1024,0.97,8484.075,8487.312,Seattle municipal Court in the report was open to the idea.,97,,
1025,0.97,8487.312,8508.199,"Essentially it would be to have a community based group be able to provide services to help the individual stay out of trouble and ensure they get to their hearings so think don't Miss it, don't have a warrant out for their arrest which can lead to Incarceration.",97,,
1026,0.97,8508.199,8520.178,What the these groups do with proper funding or could do would be able to have Childcare for a working parent that needed to get to court.,97,,
1027,0.97,8520.178,8526.885,"It could be looking at transportation, if that's one impediments.",97,,
1028,0.97,8526.885,8538.83,"A case can be as simple as making sure they're in touch with the individual through phone, E-mail, those types of mediums just to build that connection and remind the individual about the upcoming court date.",97,,
1029,0.97,8538.83,8551.809,Again be sure they have whatever they need to be able to get there and avoid the negative consequences that can come.,97,,
1030,0.97,8551.809,8558.816,The other alternative is eliminating burden of cash bail by creating or funding community bail Fund.,97,,
1031,0.97,8558.816,8565.623,This is something that the city of New York through their Council was able to do a few years back.,97,,
1032,0.97,8565.623,8575.133,They created what they called liberty fund precisely to bail folks out jail for misdemeanor offenses.,97,,
1033,0.97,8575.133,8586.244,"More locally since we are here, King County put out Rfp a couple years back to contract for community bail fund exactly for that Express purpose.",97,,
1034,0.97,8586.244,8611.869,"Muling beyond bail, the other recommendation is to look at really expanding diversion alternatives particular at the Prefiling stage or even their up stream where possible at the arrest so you can reduce the costs but still have accountability with violations.",97,,
1035,0.97,8611.869,8626.484,"We can do this by expanding alternatives we have no you and certainly when we look at programs such as lead program, familiar faces initiative we have in partnership, they address the needs in a way that's shown a lot of success.",97,,
1036,0.97,8626.484,8640.732,But what we could do is make sure we are using validated risk needs assessments so we can match individuals with appropriate level and type of support they need to be sure they stay out of the system.,97,,
1037,0.97,8640.732,8663.254,"The recommendation on this portion would be to do validated risk need assessment at the Prosecutor stage but preferably through a community based partner that would be able to administer assessments in a community setting and then in conjunction with a city attorneys office, be able to determine the most appropriate diversion program for the individuals.",97,,
1038,0.97,8663.254,8670.762,Really with the idea of going away from prosecution and harmful Incarceration.,97,,
1039,0.97,8670.762,8691.149,"Echoing with a some presentations this morning said, we do need to look at increasing funding for social services and things like permanent supportive housing which has evidence based research showing it does decrease Recidivism particularly in folks likely to filter in and out of the system.",97,,
1040,0.97,8691.149,8696.487,What I will say is we have wonderful diversion programs in city and King County.,97,,
1041,0.97,8696.487,8709.534,"One of the issues I have seen, and I think we heard Thanksgiving miracle morning, there is capacity limitations for support services that they work to have people enroll in or they can recommend for folks going through these.",97,,
1042,0.97,8709.534,8719.477,We do have a shortage of spaces for example for not only affordable housing but also substance use designated order treatment.,97,,
1043,0.97,8719.477,8741.265,"Absent the capacity to enroll folks in those needed treatment programs, we are really limited in what we can do in terms of diversion and be able to address Crimino Genic needs in a way that's humane and ultimately will be more effective than the system we have now.",97,,
1044,0.97,8741.265,8744.235,I want to take a quick pause.,98,,
1045,0.97,8744.235,8759.383,"I want to flag as it relates to diversion, Prefiling diversion no longer requires any interaction with the police Department in order to facilitate the diversion.",98,,
1046,0.97,8759.383,8771.496,"The folks who do that work, you mentioned lead, consider shelves intercept zero program.",98,,
1047,0.97,8771.496,8773.197,I just wanted to flag that.,98,,
1048,0.97,8773.197,8775.299,Thank you.,99,,
1049,0.97,8775.299,8778.402,Certainly there is more detail in written report.,99,,
1050,0.97,8778.402,8780.037,I appreciate you pointing that out.,99,,
1051,0.97,8780.037,8783.474,This is really just a general overview.,99,,
1052,0.97,8783.474,8784.041,You are right.,99,,
1053,0.97,8784.041,8806.397,What lead has done is expand to intercept zero focus which goes to with a we are talking about here.,99,,
1054,0.97,8807.832,8812.637,When it was first created it looked at intercept dollars one through five.,99,,
1055,0.97,8812.637,8818.442,It focused on what we can do in different stages to address folks going through the system.,99,,
1056,0.97,8818.442,8830.922,Later on as researchers looked at the work and the idea evolved they created intercept zero.,99,,
1057,0.97,8830.922,8834.492,This is opportunity to address needs before folks get involved.,99,,
1058,0.97,8834.492,8842.967,This is really talking about prevention and making sure we are taking steps to reduce the need.,99,,
1059,0.97,8842.967,8847.805,Intercept zero is really the hero so to speak.,99,,
1060,0.97,8847.805,8875.466,"If the city starts implementing some of the recommendations and of course we do have jail contract with King County, but if it would be possible to continue negotiations and reduce spending on the jail contract which at this point is around 18 to $20 million a year, that would allow us to be able to use savings from that to be able to put into other programming.",99,,
1061,0.97,8875.466,8883.174,We would see reduction in arrests and attention with the pretrial.,99,,
1062,0.97,8883.174,8893.618,This is to reinvest the savings to historically under Resourced communities where we see the most need.,99,,
1063,0.97,8893.618,8903.594,Certainly the black brilliance project I think laid out a vision for how Participatory budgeting could work.,99,,
1064,0.97,8903.594,8913.237,The idea would be to look at what are investments in programs that could reduce needs to reduce the use of the system.,99,,
1065,0.97,8913.237,8920.645,"Really if looking at more up stream solutions, we need to look at diverse childhood experiences.",99,,
1066,0.97,8920.645,8938.963,These are important because research shows us that aces are traumatic experiences which can cause toxic stress in children and repeated exposure to toxic stress as they grow can harm their brain development.,99,,
1067,0.97,8938.963,8954.645,"As they experience higher levels of aces what we have seen is children struggle to learn, struggle to complete schooling and are at higher risk of becoming involved in criminal juvenile legal system.",99,,
1068,0.97,8954.645,8964.622,Previous criminal history is one of the factors that we can use to predict propensity for criminal legal system involvement.,99,,
1069,0.97,8964.622,8986.51,"Further than that, we see that Te centers for disease control for example have noted that adults who experience higher levels of aces may face increased employment stability, leaving finances, jobs, families and will have impact on children who because of that can experience their own aces as a Reult.",99,,
1070,0.97,8986.51,9007.665,This is way to stop the Intergenerational trauma and what we see with a lot of this being folks that have deprivation and have it passed to their children and really do see what we talk about with the school to prison pipeline.,99,,
1071,0.97,9007.665,9019.21,"Talking about how these aces can impact, there have been studies that look at the number of aces that folks that have been convicted of a crime have relative to folks that have not.",99,,
1072,0.97,9019.21,9039.263,"What we see in the research is that folks that are adults, particularly adult males convicted of a crime, reported four times as many adverse childhood events as adult males in the normative sample.",99,,
1073,0.97,9039.263,9048.572,Back to prevention and making sure we are addressing the causes as early as possible will be the way to reduce the use of the system.,99,,
1074,0.97,9048.572,9058.349,"What this will look at is Childcare, health and mental health services, employment services, early education programs, affordable housing as well.",99,,
1075,0.97,9058.349,9064.288,"In my last slide, I won't go into this in much detail because it is included in the report.",99,,
1076,0.97,9064.288,9079.003,One of the final pieces Council asked me to look at as I was engaging in the criminal system realignment work.,99,,
1077,0.97,9079.003,9103.861,"If the city moves forwards with implementing recommendations, keeping in mind guiding principles, one of the main ones was ensuring any type of work such as this is involving community members from communities that have been most impacted by the system and assuring we're taking their considerations into the planning and into the execution.",99,,
1078,0.97,9103.861,9109.4,These are just the recommendations I would have on recreating Cjcc.,99,,
1079,0.97,9109.4,9113.437,This is a brief overview because I know we have limited time.,99,,
1080,0.97,9113.437,9122.146,"The report itself goes into a lot more detail as to research, methods, recommendations, and supporting evidence.",99,,
1081,0.97,9122.146,9145.002,"Before I close, the last thing I will say is as I engaged in this work, one of the things I made sure to do apart from having the Fidelity to a community as told to us in the past was also reaching out to folks from different national level institutions working on this type of research and these types of developments.",99,,
1082,0.97,9145.002,9156.714,One thing I wanted to highlight is I did speak with subject matter experts at organizations.,99,,
1083,0.97,9156.714,9160.918,They commend this as reflective to justice system reform and realignment.,99,,
1084,0.97,9160.918,9170.394,"With that, I will open it up to questions.",99,,
1085,0.97,9170.394,9170.861,Thank you Carlos.,100,,
1086,0.97,9170.861,9178.068,We'll see if there are any raised hands here.,100,,
1087,0.97,9178.068,9184.375,"Really appreciate the work that you have done, Carlos.",100,,
1088,0.97,9184.375,9184.875,Councilman Morales.,100,,
1089,0.97,9184.875,9185.576,Thank you.,101,,
1090,0.97,9185.576,9186.944,"Carlos, thank you for this.",101,,
1091,0.97,9186.944,9191.382,I know you have been working on this for a long time.,101,,
1092,0.97,9191.382,9193.951,Really appreciate the work that you are doing here.,101,,
1093,0.97,9193.951,9205.296,I know you have been doing a lot with community and community task force as well.,101,,
1094,0.97,9205.296,9247.004,"You mentioned possibly using, if we are able to reduce spending on the jail contract, using it to support some investments we need in the intercept zero kinds of activities, I would be interested to know your thoughts about why not also diverting funds, using funds we are diverting from SPD rather than into city attorneys office, if we are really trying to shrink the whole criminal legal system, using those resources as well into investing in this intercept zero type of alternatives.",101,,
1095,0.97,9247.004,9251.642,"Thank you for your question, Councilmember Morales.",102,,
1096,0.97,9251.642,9255.679,Honestly my answer is we absolutely should do that.,102,,
1097,0.97,9255.679,9273.397,"In terms of looking at spending, my recommendation would be to make sure that we are looking at not only what can we do up stream but also how can we use funds to make sure that the system we have now is also addressing these needs is not punitive.",102,,
1098,0.97,9273.397,9298.289,"As we see a move away from funding some of these services that we currently fund such as say the police at the level that we are particularly when talking about over time spending, talking about behavioral health crises for instance and there would be dug savings for that.",102,,
1099,0.97,9298.289,9309.299,"When we look at alternatives to arrest, that is a selling point as a potential cost saving measure ire.",102,,
1100,0.97,9309.299,9321.245,If we do employ Theseofficers time is reduced in terms of how long they're at the stop or engaging with the individual verses what would happen if we are taking them to jail in the booking process.,102,,
1101,0.97,9321.245,9324.782,That can see additional cost savings.,102,,
1102,0.97,9324.782,9340.864,The recommendation is to look at how we can use the savings to not bring new money in but to really take from one part and put it into something we know will be more effective and less harmful.,102,,
1103,0.97,9340.864,9365.422,"Just to respond to some of the public comment I thought I heard around the recommendations, the recommendations I saw about.",103,,
1104,0.97,9365.422,9369.126,Are there other investments this report recommends?,103,,
1105,0.97,9369.126,9369.46,There is.,104,,
1106,0.97,9369.46,9393.951,"Right now, the way that we have our system set up and largely talking to our city attorneys office and looking at research, looking at what they have put out, one of the impediments we would have is it currently takes city attorneys office about 187 days to make filing decisions.",104,,
1107,0.97,9393.951,9415.773,"The problem is research also tells us that the greater amount of time that lapses between that initial interaction with a police officer and especially if talking about not taking folks to jail but using alternatives to arrest, more time that lapses between that interaction and first court date increases likelihood that folks will have a failure to appear for court.",104,,
1108,0.97,9415.773,9448.138,"So part of what I mentioned in the report which would be the one aspect where we could increase the system would be looking at taking some of the funds saved from potentially police Department, putting those Incity attorneys office to expand number of prosecutors they have for the explicit purpose of making decisions at a faster rate and that could be proviso so it is not used for prosecution, only used for diversion division within the criminal division of the Cao.",104,,
1109,0.97,9448.138,9463.587,Really limiting use of funds in a way that's not punitive but that increases likelihood that folks aren't going to get Ftas and have punitive responses that come with having the warrants out.,104,,
1110,0.97,9463.587,9464.154,Thank you.,105,,
1111,0.97,9464.154,9464.888,That's super helpful.,105,,
1112,0.97,9464.888,9470.093,It looks like we may have just lost our Quorum.,105,,
1113,0.97,9470.093,9473.864,I think we got to the end here.,105,,
1114,0.97,9473.864,9501.258,"I really appreciate all of your work, Carlos and the work of folks at Socr and of course the many, many years and hours put in by community members who participated in the Workgroup as well as their lived experience and I think the title of your report, remind me what it is, Carlos.",105,,
1115,0.97,9501.258,9510.4,I think it does a nice job of honoring that.,105,,
1116,0.97,9510.4,9519.743,"The title is realigning Seattle's criminal legal system through public health approach, intersection between community wisdom and Evidence-Based practices.",106,,
1117,0.97,9519.743,9523.547,Thank you so much.,107,,
1118,0.97,9523.547,9524.748,You're welcome.,108,,

1121,0.97,9528.986,9538.962,The next meeting is scheduled for June 22.,110,,
1122,0.97,9538.962,9547.204,"Before we adjourn, are there any comments from committee members?",110,,
1123,0.97,9547.204,9547.437,Great.,110,,
1124,0.97,9547.437,9550.741,"It is 12:11 p.m., and we are adjourned.",110,,
1125,0.97,9550.741,9551.174,Thank you so much.,110,,
