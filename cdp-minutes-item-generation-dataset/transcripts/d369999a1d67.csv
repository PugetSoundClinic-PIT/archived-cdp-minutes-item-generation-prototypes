44,0.97,252.952,257.89,"Yeah, my name is Anne-Marie Dooley, I live in district 4 and I have some comments on the Seattle transportation plan, specifically crisis.",10,,
45,0.97,257.89,259.292,First I have a confession to make.,10,,
46,0.97,259.292,260.126,I am a biker.,10,,
47,0.97,260.126,266.666,I've never been a member of a bicycle Club but I'm thinking today because I feel some of the city takes Cycling as an opportunity for a small niche group.,10,,
48,0.97,266.666,283.316,I started Biking in third grade 2 school HURCO I continued because I couldn't afford to pay bus fares.,10,,
49,0.97,283.316,287.62,"Biking also allows me as a woman to avoid Street Harassment that comes from standing at bus stops, especially after dark.",10,,
50,0.97,287.62,292.392,Now as a doctor I continue to bike because I know that small trips on bikes beat cancer by up to 40%.,10,,
51,0.97,292.392,296.863,"Biking and Seattle in terms of determination and planning, when kids were small it was hard to get to preschool.",10,,
52,0.97,296.863,305.872,Crossing I-5 safely was a nightmare with my three and Five-Year-Olds but I knew if they rode bikes as kids they were much more likely to continue as adults.,10,,
53,0.97,305.872,311.01,"I'm thoroughly proud of my daughter who is now 13, because as you grow she'll be subject to the same Harassment that I was.",10,,
54,0.97,311.01,314.681,I understand that some Councilmembers may not understand this but the bike provides huge freedom to women.,10,,
55,0.97,314.681,331.698,"It allows us to avoid empty bus stops, platforms or parking lot after hours and I know many women who traverse the city after dark . This forced car ownership has been Well- documented.",10,,
56,0.97,331.698,333.299,Bike lanes are not just a nice extra.,10,,
57,0.97,333.299,334.367,They're absolutely fundamental to equity.,10,,
58,0.97,334.367,339.872,"Getting people out of cars, especially families, may only be possible with a connected bike network with separated provisions and protected from traffic.",10,,
59,0.97,339.872,342.508,"I'm asking you to please ensure this network, thank you.",10,,
60,0.97,342.508,342.942,Thank you.,11,,
61,0.97,342.942,348.881,Next we have Hollis Lockhart followed by Gary Miller.,11,,
62,0.97,348.881,354.854,"Go ahead, Alice.",11,,
63,0.97,354.854,356.956,"Good morning, committee members.",12,,
64,0.97,356.956,364.13,"On Alice Lockhart in Seattle, also speaking to the transportation plan.",12,,
65,0.97,364.13,373.573,A deep appreciation to the previous Speaker.,12,,
66,0.97,373.573,374.44,My mind and my heart.,12,,
67,0.97,374.44,377.11,Personal vehicle travel continues to be Seattle's largest source of carbon emissions.,12,,
68,0.97,377.11,385.551,This transportation plan is Mission-Critical to Seattle's climate goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.,12,,
69,0.97,385.551,404.37,The plan needs to get serious about reducing vehicle miles traveled him and this means building up support for all other Modalities and never sacrificing one transit or active transportation mode for another.,12,,
70,0.97,404.37,412.311,"It requires a planned process that will deliver direct space and convenient bike and transit routes to work and services, as well as last mile connections to transit that are safe for people walking, rolling, and Biking.",12,,
71,0.97,412.311,415.181,"To do these things we need truly integrated planning, not planning and specific cycles.",12,,
72,0.97,415.181,419.952,We need to Prioritize emission reduction over personal vehicle traffic flow.,12,,
73,0.97,419.952,432.765,It also needs to include climate emission targets and Metrics for evaluating them and updating the plans as needed in coming years.,12,,
74,0.97,432.765,449.749,"I urge counsel to hold the privies O until S.Can articulate a detailed planning process that is designed, thank you.",12,,
75,0.97,449.749,451.717,Next we have Gary Miller followed by Robin Briggs.,13,,
76,0.97,451.717,452.585,"Go ahead, Gary.",13,,
77,0.97,452.585,476.409,"Good morning, my name is Gary Miller and I just wanted to point out that Seattle, under the Vach on Glaciation there was 3300 feet of ice on top of Seattle, and over the course of 6500 years, Co2 levels went up 75 points over 6500 years, and that melted that ice.",14,,
78,0.97,476.409,483.349,We've added 50 parts per million since the year 2000.,14,,
79,0.97,483.349,493.492,"And since fossil fuels started to be burned in the 18th and 19th centuries, we've added 170 parts per million.",14,,
80,0.97,493.492,497.23,"Now all around the world, scientists are jumping up and down and ringing the alarm bells.",14,,
81,0.97,497.23,500.766,We've got to get rid of the Co2 emissions.,14,,
82,0.97,500.766,503.502,Getting people out of their cars and onto bikes.,14,,
83,0.97,503.502,503.736,Sorry?,14,,
84,0.97,503.736,509.375,Go ahead.,15,,
85,0.97,509.375,509.775,Oh.,16,,
86,0.97,509.775,519.852,Getting people onto bikes and out of their cars is one way we can reduce Co2 emissions.,16,,
87,0.97,519.852,523.756,"Biking is a chicken and egg problem, because you know there's a lot of safety issues with people.",16,,
88,0.97,523.756,532.431,"One of the things that's helped is the wide adoption and availability of electric assist bikes, which helps with Seattle's topography.",16,,
89,0.97,532.431,540.006,"But still the safety issue, Okay, is that it?",16,,
90,0.97,540.006,540.64,Am I done?,16,,
91,0.97,540.64,541.941,Thank you very much.,17,,
92,0.97,541.941,543.943,You can also send an Email to counsel at Seattle.Gov.,17,,
93,0.97,543.943,552.919,Next we've got Robin Briggs followed by Rachel Schaefer.,17,,
94,0.97,552.919,553.552,"Go ahead, Robin.",17,,
95,0.97,553.552,555.087,"Hello, my name is Robin Briggs.",18,,
96,0.97,555.087,556.756,Thank you for allowing me to speak.,18,,
97,0.97,556.756,566.198,I'm here today to talk about the transportation plan.,18,,
98,0.97,566.198,568.734,It needs to be consistent with other city policies including on climate.,18,,
99,0.97,568.734,580.079,"Seattle has the goal of being carbon neutral by 2050, but I'd like to point out that the city has developed to reduce overall emissions 58% by 2030, which they say will require an 82% reduction in emissions from transportation by 2030.",18,,
100,0.97,580.079,582.048,"82% reduction in 7 1/2 years, that's a lot.",18,,
101,0.97,582.048,584.65,The interim goal in 2030 is extremely important.,18,,
102,0.97,584.65,623.823,"First it's a Mid-Point checkpoints, but more importantly because the Ipcc says that without significant reductions, 50% of greenhouse gases in this decade, we will get a level of warming that our culture may not survive, even if our planet is carbon neutral by 2050.",18,,
103,0.97,623.823,628.327,The transportation plan needs to include a plan for how we reduce emissions as called for by the city by 2030.,18,,
104,0.97,628.327,632.431,Meeting this goal is going to be difficult and therefore needs to be a Foundational part of the plan.,18,,
105,0.97,632.431,635.668,I was dismayed to see that it is not even mentioned in the presentation today.,18,,
106,0.97,635.668,642.441,Please develop a plan and an engagement plan that will offer us informed choices about how to meet the climate crisis.,18,,
107,0.97,642.441,646.579,"Don't just ask people what wonderful infrastructure they want, or what their values are, although these are useful questions.",18,,
108,0.97,646.579,655.388,"We told you that we want you to reduce our emissions and it's up to you to tell us how we can do that and to present us with reasonable choices grounded in reality, with costs, benefits and alternatives laid out.",18,,
109,0.97,655.388,656.922,Let's start a real conversation about --,18,,
110,0.97,656.922,658.224,Thank you very much.,19,,
111,0.97,658.224,662.762,"And again, folks, you can Email your comments as well to Council at Seattle.Gov, which will reach all nine Councilmembers.",19,,
112,0.97,662.762,663.663,"Good morning, committee members.",20,,
113,0.97,663.663,665.364,My name is Rachel Schaefer.,20,,
114,0.97,665.364,671.671,I'm speaking on behalf of my bicycle Club regarding the Seattle transportation plan.,20,,
115,0.97,671.671,678.611,This plan is an opportunity to build on the bike master plan and plan for bike investments for next decade and beyond.,20,,
116,0.97,678.611,682.682,We support the concept of bringing these plans together to assess them Holistically.,20,,
117,0.97,682.682,693.726,"Replacing the bike master plan alone would be a huge list, let alone working on all four plans together at the same time.",20,,
118,0.97,693.726,701.067,Back in the creation of the current bike master plan that involved dozens of hours of volunteer effort and it also had some really important goals and Metrics for our bike network.,20,,
119,0.97,701.067,709.241,We want to make sure that this new plan builds on those goals rather than starting over.,20,,
120,0.97,709.241,714.78,"We also want to know that the values of safety, equity, and climate are important to both Sdot and the people who use our transportation system.",20,,
121,0.97,714.78,719.085,So it's important that those are considered when planning for improving the bike network.,20,,
122,0.97,719.085,732.498,"We already have a lot of data on people walking and Biking in the city, as well as where the inequalities in the bike network are.",20,,
123,0.97,732.498,735.568,So let's make sure that those data inputs are Prioritized throughout this entire process.,20,,
124,0.97,735.568,742.641,"And if others on the call Commenting have already mentioned, this is also an important tool for addressing transportation's goals into getting climate change.",20,,
125,0.97,742.641,749.849,"We are glad to see the numbers engaging now, given that the city council will eventually adopt this plan and their engagement will be really important throughout this entire process.",20,,
126,0.97,749.849,751.083,Thanks for your time.,20,,
127,0.97,751.083,751.484,Thank you.,21,,
128,0.97,751.484,760.392,"Next we have Christopher Hoffman, follows by Sarah Lough it.",21,,
129,0.97,760.392,764.029,"Go ahead, Christopher.",21,,
130,0.97,764.029,767.333,"Wow, my name is Christopher Hoffman and I'm a resident of district for neck.",22,,
131,0.97,767.333,769.635,I urge you to Prioritize vision zero in the master plan.,22,,
132,0.97,769.635,779.678,Many if not most of the conflict between the modal plans come because Sdot wants to improve parking and turn lanes.,22,,
133,0.97,779.678,783.849,"In essence, they want to Prioritize driving over the health and safety of bikers.",22,,
134,0.97,783.849,790.055,The current plan says it will Prioritize a safe bike network and what it calls critical connections.,22,,
135,0.97,790.055,802.134,So it's hard for me to imagine was a more critical connection for cyclists in district 4 then the area around the University bridge going into downtown.,22,,
136,0.97,802.134,810.376,Yet the current plan for this region does not call for fully protected bike lanes.,22,,
137,0.97,810.376,811.277,In this critical connection.,22,,
138,0.97,811.277,818.184,This is what we are doing where the conflict is between cars and bikes.,22,,
139,0.97,818.184,828.16,Imagine the freedom Sdot has two got the bike master plan when it's between bike and transit.,22,,
140,0.97,828.16,833.933,I urge you to Prioritize vision zero in the transportation plan.,22,,
141,0.97,833.933,841.273,Anything else is putting people's commute time over the health and safety of Seattle.,22,,
142,0.97,841.273,841.674,Thank you.,22,,
143,0.97,841.674,845.778,"Thank you, next we've got Sarah followed by Julia Buck.",23,,
144,0.97,845.778,854.92,"Go ahead, Sarah.",23,,
145,0.97,854.92,861.927,"Wow, I'm Cochair of the Seattle advisory board and also Commenting on the Seattle transportation plan.",24,,
146,0.97,861.927,870.736,The board has received visitations about the modal integration policy and the Seattle transportation plan.,24,,
147,0.97,870.736,876.809,"We've asked many questions during these presentations to try to understand the technical work of what except the plan, but the answers we've received have not addressed our concerns.",24,,
148,0.97,876.809,895.527,The modal integration policy boils incredibly complex restraints down to a simple list of how to Prioritize modes via just four steps.,24,,
149,0.97,895.527,897.997,This policy indicates the network is only Prioritized as critical connections.,24,,
150,0.97,897.997,904.703,The Seattle transportation plan is opposed to remove conflict between modal plans but it appears that it's removing conflict by the Prioritizing safe Biking infrastructure and eliminating the bike master plan.,24,,
151,0.97,904.703,917.116,"Furthermore, in July, we were shown a draft of the modal integration policy and told that this policy will be key in informing the Seattle transportation plan.",24,,
152,0.97,917.116,922.621,"If this was a case, than the public must be given the opportunity to provide input into the specifics of the modal integration policy, as well.",24,,
153,0.97,922.621,935.267,"We ask that city council request detailed plans about the technical work of what makes up the modal integration policy and the Seattle transportation plan, and we also ask that city council request specific details about the stated public outreach process.",24,,
154,0.97,935.267,936.168,Thank you very much.,24,,
155,0.97,936.168,944.243,"Thank you, next we've got Julia followed by--signed up as Kachina roads.",25,,
156,0.97,944.243,944.677,"Go ahead, Julia.",25,,
157,0.97,944.677,951.016,"Good morning, Councilmembers, and Councilmember Pedersen.",26,,
158,0.97,951.016,951.85,My name is Julia Buck.,26,,
159,0.97,951.85,954.219,I'm a resident of district 6.,26,,
160,0.97,954.219,963.462,"In 2012 I was in a severe car accident that left me with Ptsd and anxiety, so that I'm no longer able to drive.",26,,
161,0.97,963.462,976.442,"I rely on bicycle and bus to get around, and our current approach to transportation in this city is Ablest and Classist.",26,,
162,0.97,976.442,989.455,"And looking at the plan where bicycles are treated as a nice to have, auxiliary, the price difference between a bicycle and a motor vehicle is enormous.",26,,
163,0.97,989.455,994.393,The price in upkeep between a bicycle and a motor vehicle is enormous.,26,,
164,0.97,994.393,1021.787,"We need to make getting around our city more accessible, and that means Prioritizing buses and bicycles, and the alternative is Prioritizing rich people who can afford cars, and if they're stuck like me, afford cars and a driver.",26,,

175,0.97,1091.323,1104.403,"But there is only not enough room if we can see that private cars and trucks, which don't have their own modal plan, by the way, are going to remain our primary way of getting around for the rest of the 21st century.",28,,

320,0.97,2200.665,2207.204,Yes.,65,,
321,0.97,2207.204,2207.805,Chair Peterson?,66,,
322,0.97,2207.805,2208.239,Yes.,67,,
323,0.97,2208.239,2209.941,"Four in favor, none are opposed.",68,,
324,0.97,2209.941,2216.08,"Thank you, the motion carries and the committee recommendation that the bill passed will be sent to the March 22nd city council meeting.",69,,
325,0.97,2216.08,2234.131,"All right, will the clerk please read the title of the next agenda item into the record?",69,,
326,0.97,2238.135,2255.253,"Agenda item 2, council bill 120282, and ordinance vacating a portion of the alley in block 6, AA Denny's second edition, in the block bounded by University street, first Avenue, Seneca street, and second Avenue, in downtown, and accepting a property use and development agreement on the petition of Hs 2 U owner LLC, for briefing and discussion.",70,,
327,0.97,2255.253,2255.92,Thank you.,71,,
328,0.97,2255.92,2260.257,"Colleagues, as with the next item on our agenda, this project is at the second and final stage for approval.",71,,
329,0.97,2260.257,2263.027,"This item is an alley vacation, conceptually approved back in 2016, I believe.",71,,
330,0.97,2263.027,2273.738,"With this Council bill 120282, we are essentially recognizing that Fdot and central staff have confirmed the applicant has met and/or will meet the public benefit and other conditions previously adopted by the city.",71,,
331,0.97,2273.738,2289.286,"We will vote on this alley vacation at our next meeting, scheduled for April 5. today we'll have a folder presentation, so as usual I'll turn it over to our city council central staff analyst, Lish Whitson.",71,,
332,0.97,2289.286,2289.553,Welcome.,71,,
333,0.97,2289.553,2290.121,Good morning.,72,,
334,0.97,2290.121,2305.302,So this is a partial alley vacation for the block in downtown Seattle that's bounded by first and second avenues and Seneca and university streets.,72,,
335,0.97,2305.302,2316.914,Just to the South of the Seattle art museum.,72,,
336,0.97,2317.848,2331.329,"As Council, as the chair mentioned, conditional approval was granted in 2016, and at this phase, of Council's work you and approval of the vacation, you could consider whether or not the conditions that were placed in 2016 have been met.",72,,
337,0.97,2331.329,2347.478,"If they have been met then the committee should approve final vacation of the alley, and that would allow for the transfer of the property ownership of the alley right away, to the building's owner.",72,,
338,0.97,2347.478,2364.295,"And if you don't have any questions on how that thing works for decision-making, I'll handed over to the rest of the Presenters who will talk about the project itself.",72,,
339,0.97,2364.295,2364.929,Thank you.,73,,
340,0.97,2364.929,2378.109,"As usual, we'll hear next from Seattle Department of transportation, who helps Sheppard us through these various vacation of streets, alleys, et cetera.",73,,
341,0.97,2378.109,2381.078,"So Beverly Barnett, a familiar face here at Committee, nice to see you again.",73,,
342,0.97,2381.078,2381.345,Welcome.,73,,
343,0.97,2381.345,2381.946,Good morning.,74,,
344,0.97,2381.946,2387.952,"We are very happy to be here with this project and what we are going to do for you this morning, thank you, Lish, for providing the background.",74,,
345,0.97,2387.952,2414.678,"I just have a couple remarks, and then Michael Jenkins, who is the executive director of the design Commission, is going to make a couple remarks about the Commission review, and in particular the inclusion of art and cultural space in this project, which is the first time that we have done that.",74,,
346,0.97,2414.678,2427.992,"And then, Murphy McCullough is going to go through a Powerpoint, and they're doing the Powerpoint as the developer, to show how the Council conditions were implemented, and it's a bit of a complicated site with many different levels, so the Powerpoint I think shows really well how the conditions were implemented.",74,,
347,0.97,2427.992,2442.606,"So as the chair and Lish has reminded the committee, this is the final ordinance, which is the last, and second and final step of the approval process.",74,,
348,0.97,2442.606,2444.341,The Council has established a two-part approval process.,74,,
349,0.97,2444.341,2457.788,"In order for the city to stay engaged through the development, and make sure that the conditions that were important to the Council were that conditions of the vacation are implemented.",74,,
350,0.97,2457.788,2472.937,"So once the conditional approval is granted by the Council, the developer can go out and secure master use permits, development permits, utility permits, and they literally build over the alley.",74,,
351,0.97,2472.937,2492.756,"Many of the conditions that the Council is concerned about are kind of the last pieces, so we generally see the final vacation ordinance around the time of a project opening, and sometimes afterwards these documents can be kind of complex.",74,,
352,0.97,2492.756,2516.28,"But we do really appreciate that committee time to go through the Powerpoint, because it does show how the conditions were implemented, and I think it provides for staff that have a role in monitoring and implementing additional guidance from the Committee on the kinds of public benefit features that they think are really effective and meaningful for the community, and the kinds of things that we can look to Replicate in the future.",74,,
353,0.97,2516.28,2522.286,So I think this project viewed very closely to the conditions imposed by the Council.,74,,
354,0.97,2522.286,2538.102,"We do generally see a few modifications based on code or utility issues, and when we get into the Powerpoint we'll look at their work and maybe Michael will want to speak to this.",74,,
355,0.97,2538.102,2550.18,"There art spaces were Consolidated at the request of the office of arts and culture, to provide more usable and meaningful space.",74,,
356,0.97,2550.18,2558.789,"So I think with that, unless there's questions for me about Sdot implementation, that will look to Michael Jenkins, and then the Powerpoint will probably spark more questions.",74,,
357,0.97,2558.789,2561.725,But we wanted to set it up before you see all the good stuff.,74,,
358,0.97,2561.725,2567.898,"Michael, you want to jump in?",74,,
359,0.97,2567.898,2570.434,"Sure, thanks, Beverly, for that introduction, and good morning, Councilmember.",75,,
360,0.97,2570.434,2572.136,"It's nice to see you all, at least virtually.",75,,
361,0.97,2572.136,2586.583,"I think Beverly really hit on what I just wanted to briefly comment on, which is I have a Multifaceted public backup package like this here, the innovative approach really here, we think is noteworthy, is the 1200 square-foot performance space.",75,,
362,0.97,2586.583,2608.372,"When the project was originally envisioned it was to be two separate spaces, and again, as Beverly highlighted, really to increase the utility of the space they were put in, Reconfigured, the space can be directly accessed both physically and visually from the surrounding street, which is important.",75,,
363,0.97,2608.372,2619.883,"The team worked very closely with the city, with the Commission, and their consultants to develop a programming and operating plan with equity and equitable outcomes as an organizing principle.",75,,
364,0.97,2619.883,2620.951,We appreciate it.,75,,
365,0.97,2620.951,2637.167,"We think that this project provides a very useful template for other innovative approaches, including those being envisioned by the cultural space and public fountain committee.",75,,
366,0.97,2637.167,2665.963,"If you recall, Matthew Richter, who led the effort of office of arts and culture, now leads this effort at PDA and he was one of the champions for this project prior to the establishment of the cultural space of PDA, and we also worked recently on the grant Street Commons project, which included similar space, which you would approve a couple of months ago.",75,,
367,0.97,2665.963,2670.3,"With that, I think if there's no questions for me, I will throw it over to Murphy and his team.",75,,
368,0.97,2670.3,2670.634,Great.,76,,
369,0.97,2670.634,2671.268,"Thank you, Michael.",76,,
370,0.97,2671.268,2682.179,"Murphy, bill Laborde is going to run the Powerpoint, so you can provide bill the next slide, please, kind of thing.",76,,
371,0.97,2682.179,2688.018,"Murphy, I'm not sure all the committee members have worked with you, so if you do an introduction and you get into the Powerpoint with bill's assistance?",76,,
372,0.97,2688.018,2690.32,I'm Murphy McCullough.,77,,
373,0.97,2690.32,2701.665,"I run the real estate operation here in Seattle, obviously with a fantastic team, and I have Stewart Jermaine, who is also on the team and has been much more into the details.",77,,
374,0.97,2701.665,2705.536,"So in case there is some really detailed questions, he can help with that.",77,,
375,0.97,2705.536,2706.17,I'm from Seattle.,77,,
376,0.97,2706.17,2714.011,I actually live in West Seattle so I was interested to hear some of those comments recently.,77,,
377,0.97,2714.011,2720.451,But I have been working in the urban core with multiple buildings for my 30 year career.,77,,
378,0.97,2720.451,2723.187,I was also chair of the downtown design review board.,77,,
379,0.97,2723.187,2729.593,So all of those things really--and Stewart is actually on a board right now.,77,,
380,0.97,2729.593,2738.235,"So we are really trying to make the city better, as well as novel, so we'd love to walk through this.",77,,
381,0.97,2738.235,2745.275,"First, we are also the contractor, as well, so we are a little bit unique.",77,,
382,0.97,2745.275,2752.082,"Not only are we the developer, we have a whole contracting arm that we can work closely with, to really do things that are different.",77,,
383,0.97,2752.082,2754.017,We'll walk through that here.,77,,
384,0.97,2754.017,2763.46,So go to the next slide.,77,,
385,0.97,2763.46,2770.067,"So this is just Location-Wise, I apologize, there is a Typo here.",77,,
386,0.97,2770.067,2772.402,"At the bottom of the page, that is Seneca street.",77,,
387,0.97,2772.402,2774.738,Said the project is between first and second and university and Seneca.,77,,
388,0.97,2774.738,2788.485,"So it's the partial block south of the Seattle art museum, and when you look at this slide here, at the top of the page, they're kind of green.",77,,
389,0.97,2788.485,2790.42,That is the alley that is still there.,77,,
390,0.97,2790.42,2792.322,So we did not vacate that portion.,77,,
391,0.97,2792.322,2797.294,We only vacated the Southern two thirds.,77,,
392,0.97,2797.294,2821.552,"You want to keep going on the next slide, this is a summary of our public benefits, and we are going to go through each of these Separately, so I won't spend a whole lot of time here, but you can see they are Color- coded here.",77,,
393,0.97,2821.552,2832.93,"So when you look at the open space, you can see the green open space, and the Orange, this backs from the city streets, back toward the buildings start, and then the darker Greens, the Right-Of-Way improvements, as Beverly and Michael talked about.",77,,
394,0.97,2832.93,2843.34,The arts and cultural spaces in red.,77,,
395,0.97,2843.34,2846.243,And we do have a hill climb assist from first to second Avenue.,77,,
396,0.97,2846.243,2846.91,Quite a steep grade.,77,,
397,0.97,2846.91,2848.612,"And then, in purple, the bicycle infrastructure.",77,,
398,0.97,2848.612,2851.849,"Also, what's shown on here is there's five separate ways to get into the open space.",77,,
399,0.97,2851.849,2860.858,There's one off of University where you can see where the alley is.,77,,
400,0.97,2860.858,2865.162,There's two on second Avenue and there's two on first Avenue.,77,,
401,0.97,2865.162,2867.397,So lots of ways to get in and through this thing.,77,,
402,0.97,2867.397,2868.932,So we go to the next slide.,77,,
403,0.97,2868.932,2875.606,"The next slide, this is the summary of public benefits.",77,,
404,0.97,2875.606,2885.782,"I wasn't going to go through all of these in detail, but of course, any questions you have, we can go through whatever you want.",77,,
405,0.97,2885.782,2894.491,"But really, the open space section at the top, and the setbacks below it, those kind of work together.",77,,
406,0.97,2894.491,2896.793,They're both open space.,77,,
407,0.97,2896.793,2898.295,The setbacks are more adjacent to city streets.,77,,
408,0.97,2898.295,2899.93,You can see Pluses or Minuses there.,77,,
409,0.97,2899.93,2912.342,"When you actually add those up, the Pluses and Minuses, we've actually provided 222 more square feet of like open space than originally in the package that was approved way back when.",77,,
410,0.97,2912.342,2916.813,We also provided 52 extra seats in the open space.,77,,
411,0.97,2916.813,2920.884,We do have one less tree.,77,,
412,0.97,2920.884,2926.089,"What we actually did their is we have a picture of this, too.",77,,
413,0.97,2926.089,2931.728,We did get rid of two very small Pinenuts trees and provided a very large Japanese Maple tree.,77,,
414,0.97,2931.728,2937.2,So we think that's a net positive.,77,,
415,0.97,2937.2,2948.945,"And then, going down on Right- Of-Way improvements, Beverly had on this, we have about 350 less square feet of planting, and mainly that was because of civil faults.",77,,
416,0.97,2948.945,2954.184,There's all kinds of utilities that need to go in the sidewalk.,77,,
417,0.97,2954.184,2962.359,"If you put those in your sidewalk, you can actually put plantings on top of it.",77,,
418,0.97,2962.359,2965.295,We also put extra bike racks and we did provide 16 extra seats.,77,,
419,0.97,2965.295,2970.133,We originally had 12 and we have 28 on the Right-Of-Way.,77,,
420,0.97,2970.133,2974.671,"Than the arts and cultural space, like Beverly said, we have two spaces.",77,,
421,0.97,2974.671,2986.717,"Now we have one, which we do think works up better, by all the consultants we were talking to, and of course the city.",77,,
422,0.97,2986.717,2988.919,"Even though they are now combined, there's 58 more square feet.",77,,
423,0.97,2988.919,2996.927,"And a hill climb assist is exactly like we talked about initially, and same with the bicycle infrastructure.",77,,
424,0.97,2996.927,3011.108,"If you want to go to the next slide, so this is the open space, and for anyone who really hasn't been down there, I know it's been Covid so folks haven't been downtown as much, but the city has come alive.",77,,
425,0.97,3011.108,3014.745,"If you have a chance to go down and see it, it really is a different building.",77,,
426,0.97,3014.745,3026.49,We've essentially lifted the building 85 feet above first Avenue and created this open space arts and cultural and retail village.,77,,
427,0.97,3026.49,3034.064,"So by getting the building out of the way, we can provide all this open space.",77,,
428,0.97,3034.064,3035.732,"So we are really, really excited about it.",77,,
429,0.97,3035.732,3042.806,"You see in this picture, of course, the open space.",77,,
430,0.97,3042.806,3047.31,"We do have the bike dock, the seating, we have a drinking fountain.",77,,
431,0.97,3047.31,3048.478,We have event infrastructure.,77,,
432,0.97,3048.478,3059.189,"We see some events in the pictures here, but we have power and lighting in places, to set up for an event, and of course all kinds of landscaping and trees.",77,,
433,0.97,3059.189,3065.328,We are going to the next slide.,77,,
434,0.97,3065.328,3073.804,This is the level three lookout.,77,,
435,0.97,3073.804,3074.905,This is also the open space.,77,,
436,0.97,3074.905,3079.543,"You can see that specimen tree we were talking about, the Japanese Maple there in the center, on the left picture.",77,,
437,0.97,3079.543,3085.348,"This is also, if you walk past the big, wide column there, you have a big public viewing of the Bay, so it's a really great space.",77,,
438,0.97,3085.348,3087.451,"There's great space for kids to play over there, too.",77,,
439,0.97,3087.451,3088.085,Lots of seating.,77,,
440,0.97,3088.085,3095.425,"And then on the right, you can see the upper space to the left--sorry, to the right of the right picture is where the space is.",77,,
441,0.97,3095.425,3101.231,"If you want to go to the next slide, here is the setback.",77,,
442,0.97,3101.231,3106.036,"So again, the setbacks are like open spaces directly adjacent to the city streets.",77,,
443,0.97,3106.036,3119.749,"You can see there's some pictures of them on first Avenue, the first picture of them on the left is right next to the staircase that goes up into the open space.",77,,
444,0.97,3119.749,3137.834,"We'll get to it but there's actually an elevator here on first Avenue that gets you up to the open space, where you can go over to the elevator to get up to second Avenue 40 Alpine assist.",77,,
445,0.97,3137.834,3148.044,"And from the middle you can see right there at second and university, another big setback and open space, which directly ties it into the open space under the building.",77,,
446,0.97,3148.044,3150.814,"And then on second Avenue there, at the southeast corner, close to Seneca.",77,,
447,0.97,3150.814,3157.754,What's nice about the open space is much of it is covered.,77,,
448,0.97,3157.754,3164.928,"So many times in Seattle, we know it's just not that cold, but it's raining.",77,,
449,0.97,3164.928,3171.334,"And to have a big space that you could have events and go hang out, eat your lunch, and mingle with others, is what we were really trying to create.",77,,
450,0.97,3171.334,3176.773,So next slide.,77,,
451,0.97,3176.773,3185.315,"Right away--Right-Of-Way improvements, you can see on the left, that's first Avenue.",77,,
452,0.97,3185.315,3198.795,"You can see closely, the bike parking infrastructure, the benches and the plantings.",77,,
453,0.97,3198.795,3204.0,"Also, it's a little hard to see in this picture, but the setbacks create a really wide sidewalk on first and second, as well.",77,,
454,0.97,3204.0,3206.77,So you get this really nice feeling as you're walking down these streets.,77,,
455,0.97,3206.77,3208.505,And then same with second Avenue there.,77,,
456,0.97,3208.505,3212.609,It's very similar with the bike parking benches and planting.,77,,
457,0.97,3212.609,3212.909,Next slide.,77,,
458,0.97,3212.909,3223.687,"So the arts and cultural studio, this is really something that has not been done before, as Beverly and Michael mentioned.",77,,
459,0.97,3223.687,3226.089,It's almost 1200 square feet of performance spaces.,77,,
460,0.97,3226.089,3235.098,"It's for emerging artists based upon movement and music, as well.",77,,
461,0.97,3235.098,3246.91,"So we--some of the features of the space itself, we have put in all the infrastructure, so there is assist in there, there's a strong floor.",77,,
462,0.97,3246.91,3259.856,"There's Restrooms and changing rooms . We have blinds for privacy, too.",77,,

464,0.97,3264.527,3266.196,Shun Pike is managing this for us.,77,,
465,0.97,3266.196,3274.237,"And we are focused on trying to find disadvantaged artists, and the folks that are really priced out of the city.",77,,
466,0.97,3274.237,3289.819,"It's really hard to find a space in the city, especially given our proximity to the Seattle art Museum and the Symphony hall, we thought this could be a really great space to program into the building.",77,,
467,0.97,3289.819,3293.39,"So far, even with Covid, believe it or not, this building opened really right when Covid hit.",77,,
468,0.97,3293.39,3311.508,"So it was somewhat of a challenge to get this space programmed, but we've already had 50-Plus groups going through this space and we are really excited about how it's been operated and how it's being used, and we are excited for the future, for it as well.",77,,
469,0.97,3311.508,3311.975,Next slide.,77,,

471,0.97,3315.378,3344.14,"So this, I apologize, we don't have the picture up from first Avenue, but there is an elevator on first Avenue that I mentioned earlier, that you can walk into the elevator, go up, since this is a steep slope, you can go into the open space and then you can go over to another elevator that gets you to second Avenue, so you do have the full Hill climb assist.",77,,
472,0.97,3344.14,3348.278,"Bicycle infrastructure, many of us, it stands for bike to work.",77,,
473,0.97,3348.278,3369.933,"I bike from West Seattle often, so it's not only important for us, it's important for the city, too, and for climate change, and we are right next to the second Avenue bicycle infrastructure, too, so it's a really great spot for folks to be able to park their bike here.",77,,
474,0.97,3369.933,3387.484,"Those two metal Stanchions you can see there, each of them have a QUAD outlet there so you can charge up to 80 bikes at the same time.",77,,
475,0.97,3387.484,3389.185,"Energy is free, so there is no charge.",77,,
476,0.97,3389.185,3398.661,"And then off to the right there, you can see we've got a Fix-It repair stand, so you can work on your bike.",77,,
477,0.97,3398.661,3399.496,And that's our presentation.,77,,
478,0.97,3399.496,3408.772,"I'll be happy to take any questions, and if anybody wants a tour from the Council for folks, we'd love to show you the project.",77,,
479,0.97,3408.772,3423.42,"It's been hard to show folks with Covid so we are excited with things lifting that hopefully we can show more folks that are building, specifically the ground floor.",77,,
480,0.97,3423.42,3441.938,"Thank you, so colleagues, just a reminder, today we are just briefing and discussion and then if you do have any questions before you vote on this, on the next committee meeting on April 5, get your questions to central staff, to Lish Whitson, and if there are any questions now, feel free to ask them.",78,,

486,0.97,3479.542,3481.744,"We'll see what questions we get, if any, on this.",78,,
487,0.97,3481.744,3489.919,"Before we go, actually, Beverly, can you just confirm your belief that they've met all the conditions or will continue to meet all the conditions approved already?",78,,
488,0.97,3489.919,3497.026,"Yes, they have been very careful about working with the city throughout the process, and have met all of the conditions.",79,,
489,0.97,3497.026,3503.333,"As we talked about, there are sometimes things that a tree can't go where we thought it could because of a utility vault or something.",79,,
490,0.97,3503.333,3504.801,So there is minor Tweaks.,79,,
491,0.97,3504.801,3517.58,"But the spirit and the larger goals, and the accountability numbers have all been met.",79,,
492,0.97,3517.58,3518.414,"Thank you, Beverly.",80,,
493,0.97,3518.414,3521.284,"Lish, from the legislative Department perspective, do you concur with that, I assume?",80,,
494,0.97,3521.284,3539.402,"I just wanted to mention that this project has an exceptional package of public benefits, given its location and the scale of the building that was facilitated by the street vacation.",81,,
495,0.97,3539.402,3542.171,This is more than you will typically see from a street vacation.,81,,
496,0.97,3542.171,3546.009,"Great, thank you for that perspective.",82,,
497,0.97,3546.009,3546.509,"All right, everybody.",82,,
498,0.97,3546.509,3547.143,Thanks so much.,82,,

522,0.97,3702.965,3710.506,"So Bso P 1 LLC is the private property owner and they are the applicant, so they will be the permit holder for this term permit.",87,,
523,0.97,3710.506,3731.36,"The East Howe step steering committee, which we just call the steering committee, is the community group, and these two parties entered into a memorandum of understanding that the Department of neighborhoods help facilitate and engage both parties in.",87,,

533,0.97,3796.359,3809.872,"They have at 100% technical approval at this point, and that would, once Council votes on the ordinance, and if it's approved, that will be released and they can move forward.",87,,
534,0.97,3809.872,3813.976,The ordinance is the permit for the project.,87,,

536,0.97,3832.195,3845.074,"We require a bond, so that in case something happens and the owner walks away from the permit, and the city needs to do something to restore the right of way, it's about $15,000.",87,,
537,0.97,3845.074,3852.815,It's not that huge of a bond because the private parking area is not--doesn't require huge instruction obligations.,87,,
538,0.97,3852.815,3865.862,"The ordinance implements the development of the public Plaza that the community has wanted and desired, and we can talk about that later in the presentation, but it really is the next and final step.",87,,

546,0.97,3904.133,3935.097,"This is an illustrated map showing the hill climb in relation to the immediate streets, the image to the right shows the Plaza and then the steps that currently exist and have been built there, up to another existing Plaza, further to the East that is also a term permit, so it really does show the connection and the grade change, and the connection towards the Lake to the West.",87,,
547,0.97,3935.097,3940.469,"Next slide, please.",87,,
548,0.97,3940.469,3945.975,"So as I mentioned, the steering committee received $100,000 matching grant from the Department of neighborhoods.",87,,

556,0.97,3984.013,3985.815,"Good to see you, Ian and Beverly.",89,,
557,0.97,3985.815,4003.699,"This question, we've discussed briefly when you briefed me on this, it's just what mechanisms are going to be in place for 20 years from now where everyone has changed their position but the community outreach board might be different, it might change?",89,,
558,0.97,4003.699,4015.978,"How are we able to set for everyone who comes after us, the knowledge that there needs to be community events as part of this public benefits?",89,,
559,0.97,4015.978,4020.716,"It's specified in the ordinance, so that would be sort of the enforcement.",90,,
560,0.97,4020.716,4033.028,"So if it wasn't happening, we could go back to the permit holder and say you're not doing this and it's a term of the condition of the ordinance.",90,,
561,0.97,4033.028,4042.271,I was going to turn it over to the truck so that she could talk about how they anticipate managing the site and the events long-term.,90,,
562,0.97,4042.271,4047.543,"So Deidre, do you want to Chime in here?",90,,
563,0.97,4047.543,4059.688,"First of all, we have a very robust communication system in Eastlake and we have a couple of different--the Eastlake community Council has a Website.",91,,
564,0.97,4059.688,4060.756,We have a Facebook page.,91,,
565,0.97,4060.756,4066.195,There is Eastlake social that has a Facebook page and we are one of the last community organizations that actually has a published newsletter.,91,,
566,0.97,4066.195,4076.305,So getting word out is pretty easy and people are used to going to these Websites for information.,91,,
567,0.97,4076.305,4080.743,"So when there is an event, certainly we will get the word out that way.",91,,
568,0.97,4080.743,4090.486,"Also, people like flyers distributed so we use those within reason.",91,,
569,0.97,4090.486,4092.421,But people in Eastlake always know what's going on.,91,,
570,0.97,4092.421,4102.598,So if there's an event planned or how you can get an event planned should be easy for everybody to understand.,91,,
571,0.97,4102.598,4104.133,I hope that answered your question.,91,,
572,0.97,4104.133,4129.125,"That's really helpful, and I think what I'm trying to get at here is what happens for the next generation, so that once all of us who are on this call are no longer in our positions, and I'll use the pandemic as an example, where everything closes down for a couple years, and once it Reemerges, how does the next generation know that there needs to be public events supported for this public benefit?",92,,
573,0.97,4129.125,4129.658,I agree.,93,,
574,0.97,4129.658,4141.57,"And I think having it part of the ordinances certainly important so if anyone were to question or wonder, you can go and see that it's part of the ordinance.",93,,
575,0.97,4141.57,4170.499,"Actually Eastlake had a pretty sustainable communications network and board, the Eastlake community Council has a board that is very involved in everything, and one of our priorities is to make sure that we pass down information so that everybody--we have a resource center on our Website, so that people can go to this Website and find things like this, and this could be posted on their.",93,,
576,0.97,4170.499,4180.376,"Thank you, and wish, I don't know if you had your hand up, but this is one of the reasons it's a 15 your permit as well.",94,,
577,0.97,4180.376,4194.657,So this will come back for renewal in 15 years and that's an opportunity for the city to check and make sure that all of the conditions continue to be met.,95,,
578,0.97,4194.657,4194.957,Exactly.,96,,
579,0.97,4194.957,4205.935,"So at the 15 year mark they are required to submit an application for me, the future me, to review it and make sure that the conditions are met.",96,,
580,0.97,4205.935,4221.483,We do have inspectors within our group that will go out and I think every other year or three years inspect the Plaza to make sure that it looks and reads and acts as public space and that sort of thing.,96,,
581,0.97,4221.483,4246.208,"So we do have some sort of ongoing check INS throughout the 15 year terms but at the 15 your mark they would be required, and that's when we would verify that they are still--we've been Proactively Verifying at that point that all the conditions were met.",96,,
582,0.97,4246.208,4246.809,Chair.,97,,
583,0.97,4246.809,4257.019,"Just to say all of those answers were spot on, I'm very impressed with the public benefits in your outreach plan, and it sounds like your team is really well set to get the word out.",97,,
584,0.97,4257.019,4262.591,Just wanted to signal the question was answered and I'm impressed with your answer.,97,,
585,0.97,4262.591,4263.058,"Great work, everyone.",97,,
586,0.97,4263.058,4263.959,"Thank you, Councilmember.",98,,
587,0.97,4263.959,4278.774,In this slide we really show that the design was modified to accommodate this really significant and beautiful tree.,98,,
588,0.97,4278.774,4291.787,"Sdot likes trees, the city likes trees, the community likes trees, so we were able to be saved, and there will be 16 signed credit stalls that will be available to the public on weekends and holidays.",98,,
589,0.97,4291.787,4293.922,There's four public stalls that will be assigned as well.,98,,
590,0.97,4293.922,4305.1,"The Plaza will include landscaping and paper treatment, bike racks, and you can see some sort of amount of paving and planting surfaces, a concrete sphere, and typical planting markings on the image to the lower right.",98,,
591,0.97,4305.1,4312.474,"Next slide, please.",98,,
592,0.97,4312.474,4313.976,So this is the existing conditions right now.,98,,
593,0.97,4313.976,4315.944,The red line shows where the Plaza will be.,98,,
594,0.97,4315.944,4330.125,"It's currently used--it's technically considered unopened Right-Of-Way, even though there is concrete and is used as parking right now, it's just used as public parking.",98,,
595,0.97,4330.125,4335.264,It's considered unopened Right- Of-Way because it's not used as a street for transportation purposes.,98,,
596,0.97,4335.264,4339.868,So that red area shows the location of the Plaza.,98,,
597,0.97,4339.868,4343.072,Far in the back is the stairs that lead up to the other Plaza I mentioned.,98,,
598,0.97,4343.072,4346.575,That is under existing term permit.,98,,
599,0.97,4346.575,4351.513,"Next slide, please.",98,,
600,0.97,4351.513,4362.224,"There are some conceptual images showing what the park will look like, facing East on the right and facing West on the left, and trees and plantings and illustrations of that.",98,,
601,0.97,4362.224,4371.7,"Next slide, please.",98,,
602,0.97,4371.7,4380.309,"Here is yet another map showing the connections up to Capitol Hill on the East, through the hill climb, through the Loop trail, and other amenities around the surrounding area and Lake Union area.",98,,
603,0.97,4380.309,4384.913,"Next slide, please.",98,,
604,0.97,4384.913,4408.971,"So the applicant has met all the conditions of the resolution, and they have received 100% technical approval from the civil engineers, so that if Council APPROVES this ordinance, the permit can be issued and they can proceed with construction of the public Plaza and the private parking area.",98,,
605,0.97,4408.971,4412.875,"And like it was mentioned earlier, the original term of the permit will be for 15 years.",98,,

616,0.97,4463.826,4465.093,Seems like just a few weeks ago.,100,,
617,0.97,4465.093,4476.638,"I do have a question about the parking, and you might have covered this and I missed it, but as I understand it, we are given up public Right-Of-Way for private parking spaces.",100,,
618,0.97,4476.638,4486.582,"And you had just mentioned in one of the photographs earlier, the public parking that exists.",100,,

620,0.97,4492.154,4503.298,"For this term permit, the area that shows paved within the Redlines, that's sort of--people are parking their.",101,,
621,0.97,4503.298,4506.068,It's not designated as public parking.,101,,

624,0.97,4513.141,4547.609,"If this term permit is approved, that area within the Red would be actually the Plaza for the public to be able to use pedestrians and walking and Biking, and families, to have a respite and to use that area, and just north of this Redline off the side of the lower image would be the 16 designated private parking for the applicant, be sop 1 .

629,0.97,4570.565,4583.545,"There is no Signage that sort of Demarcates that the Right-Of- way is approved, so there's a private parking field for property at 1910 Fairview and there's this publicly available parking that Dietrich had mentioned can attest to.",102,,
630,0.97,4583.545,4588.116,It's sort of known that this is public parking.,102,,
631,0.97,4588.116,4635.097,"With this term permit, should the Council choose to approve it, that's one point that's important to know, those 16 stalls that would be used are only for weekday, daytime hours, and so, as Amy just mentioned, there are 16 stalls under the term permit, should it be approved for the weekday during the day, and then nights and weekends, all of those stalls will also be open to the public come and as part of the street improvement permit that has received Sdot approval, there is Signage that has been approved by Sdot that will Demarcate that so that it will be clear that these are term permit stalls during weekday business hours and available to the public on nights, weekends, and holidays.",102,,

640,0.97,4686.515,4697.092,We worked very well with Ian and his crew at 1910 and we think that it is actually a good template for moving forward with things.,106,,

661,0.97,4804.599,4822.717,"We also know that the Puget sound regional Council published a draft transportation plan for the region and sound transit is seeking comments on Light-Rail expansions in Seattle, so we are just clarifying, this is Sdot's planning for our Seattle transportation plan.",110,,
662,0.97,4822.717,4823.251,Just getting started.,110,,
663,0.97,4823.251,4830.892,Today we're simply hearing about their outreach and engagement strategy.,110,,
664,0.97,4830.892,4860.956,"Various modes of transportation and his new comprehensive effort will enable us to finally have a more Holistic approach to systems and infrastructure as well as to refresh the engagement with communities on what the people of Seattle are seeking with their transportation investments, and this updated public input and comprehensive approach on priorities will become especially important the nine year, $930 million f property tax levy known as move Seattle, which expires at the end of 2024.",110,,

677,0.97,4913.241,4916.645,So I had a few slides here to walk you through an introduction to the project.,116,,
678,0.97,4916.645,4940.669,"We are really excited to be getting started on this new planning process and bill, if you'll go to the next side, please, our mission and core values of the Department, this plan is really thinking more about these mission and core values and how we achieve those as a department.",116,,
679,0.97,4940.669,4948.376,"This is a key bridge between those things, so we are excited to get started on this process.",116,,
680,0.97,4948.376,4949.911,Take a look at the next slide.,116,,
681,0.97,4949.911,4976.171,"Four goals for you today for the Seattle transportation plan, share a Timeline and get into the public engagement plan, and then of course you all have the proviso on this funding and we will discuss the next steps for fulfilling the proposal.",116,,
682,0.97,4976.171,4992.22,It's great to hear comments from the public this morning and a lot of them--a lot of members of the public are thinking very similar to how we are thinking about this project.,116,,
683,0.97,4992.22,5003.331,"There are some key challenges in the city around climate action, creating more equitable transportation system, safety, stewardship of our resources.",116,,
684,0.97,5003.331,5004.766,And those are really guiding lights.,116,,
685,0.97,5004.766,5012.907,"Those are anchored in our vision and values as a Department, and really front and center for us as we think about this funding process.",116,,
686,0.97,5012.907,5030.258,"Of course our Councilmember Pedersen, you mentioned our current transportation levy expires in 2024 and this plan will help inform the development of the next transportation funding package.",116,,
687,0.97,5030.258,5041.102,So I'm really excited to have a robust community conversation about the future of our streets and how groups can work together to help meet people's needs as we consider our next package.,116,,
688,0.97,5041.102,5046.041,And we are also doubly excited to have a comprehensive plan update happening at the same time.,116,,
689,0.97,5046.041,5056.818,"This is a really unique opportunity for the city, as the folks in planning consider a whole range of issues including our growth strategy and Updatesto the growth strategy.",116,,
690,0.97,5056.818,5071.866,"I'm really excited to be working with them quite closely on our schedules and engagement practices and strategies, to think about how our transportation system can help serve the next few decades of growth for the city.",116,,
691,0.97,5071.866,5081.342,"Taking a look at the next slide, we are anchored to the comprehensive plan.",116,,
692,0.97,5081.342,5090.285,"This is a departmental plan, like we have in many departments across the city, that help flesh out the details of looking for the direction that's laid forth in the comprehensive plan.",116,,
693,0.97,5090.285,5100.028,And other key documents that were anchored to the complete streets ordinance was mentioned this morning.,116,,
694,0.97,5100.028,5103.798,Our climate action and our race and social climate action plan and race and social justice initiative.,116,,
695,0.97,5103.798,5115.844,"So we are building on all of that excellent work in addition to what are called the plans dedicated to Pestilence, bicycles, freight and transit.",116,,
696,0.97,5115.844,5124.319,Those are the Department's four key documents that we are anchored to today in addition to city documents.,116,,
697,0.97,5124.319,5130.391,"We'll be building on that work unless some concerns expressed this morning, but those are really the foundation.",116,,
698,0.97,5130.391,5144.172,"There's such an incredibly rich and strong foundation for us in those documents, both on the network maps, the policy Frameworks in those documents, and the targets that are there.",116,,
699,0.97,5144.172,5144.839,They are very Aspirational.,116,,
700,0.97,5144.839,5158.52,"In many cases, and represent years of work and communication to get to this point.",116,,
701,0.97,5158.52,5161.155,So that is our foundation and we are hoping to build on that.,116,,
702,0.97,5161.155,5164.826,"I think in addition, we've identified several gaps that fall between those plans, emerging and mobility.",116,,
703,0.97,5164.826,5165.927,Doesn't really have a home.,116,,
704,0.97,5165.927,5168.763,We see big changes in how urban goods are being delivered across the city.,116,,
705,0.97,5168.763,5172.4,Small packages have exploded.,116,,
706,0.97,5172.4,5174.302,Really changes the need for curbside.,116,,
707,0.97,5174.302,5189.517,"And then in addition, people streams and public spaces, like Occidental and Bell street, the transit mall, and how we can continue to cultivate streets as public spaces around the city.",116,,
708,0.97,5189.517,5196.157,There's another key gap in what we call the modal plan system that we have today.,116,,
709,0.97,5196.157,5206.701,"So we are hoping to think about how these plans work together, how people use the transportation system, people don't take just one or the other.",116,,
710,0.97,5206.701,5211.873,"Multimodal residence, we want to have a Multilevel plan and think about how they can work together to help us achieve our goals and values.",116,,
711,0.97,5211.873,5228.089,"On the next slide, there's a lot of change of how the system works and how people use the system.",116,,
712,0.97,5228.089,5236.497,"We are keeping the basic balance of our plans the same so there will be some residents and folks, if you're really familiar with the modal plan will be able to see that carried forward into the new plan.",116,,
713,0.97,5236.497,5238.466,So we have a policy framework with performance measures.,116,,
714,0.97,5238.466,5245.106,Modal plans will be carrying much of that content forward and integrating it here in its new process.,116,,
715,0.97,5245.106,5254.115,"Our priority investment networks, that's the bicycle map Referenced earlier in the meeting.",116,,
716,0.97,5254.115,5257.552,"We have similar maps for transit, freight, and pedestrians.",116,,
717,0.97,5257.552,5270.531,"We'll be also thinking about other maps that we can help show how things come together, integrated maps, and priority map for people, streets, and public spaces is also under consideration.",116,,
718,0.97,5270.531,5275.57,We'll be identifying new program and project needs for the apartment.,116,,
719,0.97,5275.57,5279.24,A lot is this similar to what has been successful in the past along with new opportunities.,116,,
720,0.97,5279.24,5293.287,"And then updating our prior station framework and funding strategy, so those are separated by the plans today and we'll be looking at integrating it, how to integrate those.",116,,
721,0.97,5293.287,5306.301,"On the next slide is our schedule, high-level year, and this may be hard to read for folks at home.",116,,
722,0.97,5306.301,5313.007,This Powerpoint is linked at the Council's Website if you want to see the details for this Website.,116,,
723,0.97,5313.007,5326.387,"We are in the very early and front end of this process, getting ready for our first round of engagement and starting work on our policy framework and performance measures which will run the next few months.",116,,
724,0.97,5326.387,5349.477,"So we pull that together and get in--and then you can see various phases in the project and leading up to a draft plan next year, and then transmitting our Mayor's recommended plan to Council for your consideration next summer.",116,,
725,0.97,5349.477,5362.423,With that I will join with the slides.,116,,
726,0.97,5362.423,5363.024,Thank you all.,116,,
727,0.97,5363.024,5363.891,"Thanks, Jonathan.",117,,
728,0.97,5363.891,5389.05,"We are excited this morning to share our goals for community engagement and appreciate a lot of the comments that were received this morning, and plan on reflecting a lot of those that we heard as we stepped through the proviso and making sure that our Workplan and our community engagement plan, to hear a lot of the comments that were received today around a concern for climate emergency, and the need for addressing our continued modal needs.",117,,
729,0.97,5389.05,5392.32,"So with that, I just wanted to share some of our goals for community engagement.",117,,
730,0.97,5392.32,5401.028,So it's a big project and I'm noting that we will be engaging citywide and also at the neighborhood levels.,117,,
731,0.97,5401.028,5405.066,"We really want to focus on hearing from more voices, ensuring that communities have a seat at the table.",117,,
732,0.97,5405.066,5423.084,"We want to seek to reduce barriers to participation and center racial equity in our engagement process, and help people feel empowered to really participate in this process.",117,,
733,0.97,5423.084,5429.423,"This includes partnerships with community organization and our Department of neighborhoods, community liaisons programs, to really elevate some of the voices and center race and equity in our outreach.",117,,
734,0.97,5429.423,5440.234,"And also, we'll do so by using culturally relevant accessible and inclusive strategies that includes considerations for the public health during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.",117,,
735,0.97,5440.234,5475.47,"We will use effective communication that is meaningful, relevant, easy, and uses Visuals, plain talk, and graphics as part of our engagement, and really want to emphasize that we will be provided by and Co-Create with our community and will be Iterative in order to show we are attainable to the community and the comments we hear, and also the plan reflects the community voices, including tracking who we hear from during the process, and adjusting our strategies in order to ensure that we are capturing--that what we are capturing is representative of our community.",117,,
736,0.97,5475.47,5481.509,We will listen to our community shape the plan and also use new ways of reaching out and Prioritize transparent and inclusive engagement.,117,,
737,0.97,5481.509,5482.109,"Next slide, please.",117,,
738,0.97,5482.109,5500.261,"As part of this process, we will build relationships and listen closely to people who have not historically had a seat at the transportation table, shape our future transportation system.",117,,
739,0.97,5500.261,5508.069,"So I just really want to emphasize in the slide here, we aim to Prioritize resources to engage with our Bipoc communities, our limited English populations, our Lgbtq+ immunity and evil with disabilities.",117,,
740,0.97,5508.069,5520.248,"Additionally, we plan on engaging with other communities of focus as listed there and also in addition to a citywide strategy to engage the whole community.",117,,
741,0.97,5520.248,5520.815,"Next slide, please.",117,,
742,0.97,5520.815,5534.395,"In regards to our conversation, we are excited to be able to engage the city in this unique opportunity to be able to talk about land use and transportation, knowing that those two very much are intertwined and connected to each other.",117,,
743,0.97,5534.395,5551.746,And anticipate that each plan will inform the other hand together they will provide an integrated transportation land use and growth strategy for Seattle's future.,117,,
744,0.97,5551.746,5556.117,I will note that the Seattle conference of planners is a 20 year vision and policy roadmap for growth in Seattle.,117,,
745,0.97,5556.117,5560.254,It is the city's framework for big Richard decisions and involves a Trepidation element to support our growth vision.,117,,
746,0.97,5560.254,5572.133,The transportation section of the Seattle comprehensive plan will outline broad goals and policies related to Seattle's future transportation system and the Stp itself will provide more detail on the strategies and actions it will take to fulfill our collective transportation visions.,117,,
747,0.97,5572.133,5598.96,"I will note that these two plans kicked off this last week on March 8th and we are closely coordinating with our colleagues at the office of community planning and development, who are developing the Seattle comprehensive plan, including public engagement opportunities, shared advisory boards, and other events, and the Stp Aligns with the city's growth strategy for future housing jobs and community investments.",117,,
748,0.97,5598.96,5601.329,"Next slide, please.",117,,
749,0.97,5601.329,5620.081,"And so with that we continue to step through fulfilling the Council proviso, including finalizing our work plan and community outreach plans to fulfill the proviso and anticipate Submittal of this to the city clerk in early 22.",117,,
750,0.97,5620.081,5629.957,"As I note, appreciate a lot of the comments received today and will continue to evolve our two plan documents that are tested here to ensure that we address the comments that were received.",117,,
751,0.97,5629.957,5640.468,"And so, with that, we really wanted to share--we are at the very beginning stages of our plan, as mentioned.",117,,
752,0.97,5640.468,5666.994,"We are excited to have kicked off the project and launched a project and the Website is available in addition to complementary Blog posts . to celebrate the partnerships that we have established with eight Community-Based organizations, to work with us over the course of a project, to be able to make sure that we are engaging with organizations as well as partnership with our community liaisons and forces you don't traditionally hear from.",117,,
753,0.97,5666.994,5696.524,"So just quickly noting that as we've kicked off, we are planning to spring into fall 2022, a round of engagement that we are calling just a phase one round of engagement to understand community priorities and start reviewing initial policy framework and direction, and continue to build project awareness about the Seattle transportation plan.",117,,
754,0.97,5696.524,5702.496,This will continue with phases two into fall 2022 and spring 2023 and Facebook into spring 2023.,117,,
755,0.97,5702.496,5712.973,All this information I'm sharing is available Online and on our Website and will evolve and change as we develop additional information from the public's you.,117,,
756,0.97,5712.973,5722.883,To participate Online and also just in future engagement opportunities as we continue to explore our ability to be able to in person.,117,,
757,0.97,5722.883,5729.09,Additionally there's an opportunity there to sign up for Email dates as well as to complete a short survey about the project.,117,,
758,0.97,5729.09,5736.163,So at this time I'd like to move on to the next slide and ask if you have any questions.,117,,
759,0.97,5736.163,5747.508,"Thank you very much, appreciate that early presentation from Sdot on your outreach and engagement strategy for the Seattle transportation plan.",118,,
760,0.97,5747.508,5758.919,"I have just one questions that I'll wait to see if colleagues--yes, Councilmember Morales.",118,,
761,0.97,5758.919,5765.326,"I have several questions, so I don't know if you want me to just kind of run through.",119,,
762,0.97,5765.326,5765.526,Okay.,119,,
763,0.97,5765.526,5770.164,"So, thank you for the presentation.",119,,
764,0.97,5770.164,5785.346,"I think the first thing I want to say is that I really appreciate the work that Sdot has done over the last year or two, to change the way you do community engagements.",119,,
765,0.97,5785.346,5801.262,"I think as I was working with the Department and with community members, particularly on the Lake Washington Boulevard issue last year, it was clear to me that there's been a real focus on equity, on authentic community engagement, and I think some of the things you're doing here demonstrate that transition.",119,,
766,0.97,5801.262,5809.003,So Kudos for that and I'm happy that kind of work will continue.,119,,
767,0.97,5809.003,5812.439,"That said, we heard a lot of public comment.",119,,
768,0.97,5812.439,5837.932,"Clearly folks are very concerned about at least the perception that we are moving away from all of the planning that you talked about, that we have done in the past, particularly around vision zero, around our climate change goals, and I just want to say two things, and then I'll get to my questions.",119,,
769,0.97,5837.932,5843.137,So I live in Southeast Seattle.,119,,
770,0.97,5843.137,5860.154,"To ride my bike into work it would pretty much be just a straight shot down Rainier Avenue, but I can't do that . If I want to avoid traffic, if I want to make sure that I am not at risk of getting hit by a car, I have to take a much more circuitous route.",119,,
771,0.97,5860.154,5868.863,"I think there's 34 turns that I'd have to make to get in to city hall, and two Hill clients.",119,,
772,0.97,5868.863,5874.335,"So I really want to make sure that we are talking about how people can get around, particularly if they cannot drive.",119,,
773,0.97,5874.335,5882.676,And there are lots of folks here who cannot drive and need to get around the city differently.,119,,
774,0.97,5882.676,5890.484,"The other thing is around our climate action goals, and I will say that several years ago my son was maybe 11 at the time.",119,,
775,0.97,5890.484,5908.369,"Sat around the dinner table and just sort of announced that he was not sure he would live to be 25, because we aren't even trying to meet our carbon emission reduction goals, and we know that here, the city of Seattle, that is very true.",119,,
776,0.97,5908.369,5909.403,We are way off track.,119,,
777,0.97,5909.403,5919.213,"So those two things are front of mind for me as I'm listening to what you're saying, anticipating what we will be doing over the next year.",119,,
778,0.97,5919.213,5926.353,"So that said, I have six questions.",119,,
779,0.97,5926.353,5942.569,"The first is if you can talk about how the bike and pedestrian safety analysis is being used in the plan, and how we are ensuring that that plan, when it's complete, will help us achieve our vision zero goals by 2030.",119,,
780,0.97,5942.569,5946.874,"Chair, do you want me to just run through them all?",119,,
781,0.97,5946.874,5954.715,"Yes, it looks like we are all taking notes, so we can circle back and then answer the questions.",120,,
782,0.97,5954.715,5962.256,Also happy to send these afterward if we don't get to everything.,121,,
783,0.97,5962.256,5969.063,"Second question, since transportation emissions account for the majority of Seattle's climate pollution, this plan could be the single biggest tool we have to achieve our climate goals.",122,,
784,0.97,5969.063,5979.173,So can you talk about how the planning process will Prioritize reducing climate emissions and lowering miles traveled in personal vehicles.,122,,
785,0.97,5979.173,5982.343,The third question is about equity.,122,,
786,0.97,5982.343,5998.559,"And I should say that these are questions that we are hearing from community, many of whom I think were probably calling in today.",122,,
787,0.97,5998.559,6010.571,"The question is how will the planning process achieve equity for people who are disabled, for low income people, for our communities of color, and for people that has been displaced but still need to come into Seattle?",122,,
788,0.97,6010.571,6029.823,"How does Sdot evaluate and how are you reporting on how you've achieved our existing policy goals that are already defined in our mode sharing, carbon emissions, reducing vehicle miles traveled, the plans that we already have that we've Referenced.",122,,
789,0.97,6029.823,6045.606,"How will the planning process achieve mode share goals without putting transit, bikes, and pedestrian access into competition with one another?",122,,
790,0.97,6045.606,6054.047,"I think somebody mentioned we are going to hear that there is no room for all of these things, but that's only true if we are only making cars.",122,,
791,0.97,6054.047,6062.022,So how are we actively going to do something different?,122,,
792,0.97,6062.022,6069.096,"Then it seems like the plan is really HINGING on the urban village strategy, and as you mentioned, we will be talking about the competence of planning the next year or so, as well.",122,,
793,0.97,6069.096,6072.332,"It's very possible that strategy will shift, and so how do those two things connect?",122,,
794,0.97,6072.332,6090.584,So I will leave it at that and I'm also happy to send these questions so that we can continue the conversation and continue talking about it.,122,,
795,0.97,6090.584,6091.251,Thank you.,122,,
796,0.97,6091.251,6092.286,"Thank you, Councilmember Morel is.",123,,
797,0.97,6092.286,6093.854,Thanks for getting all those questions out.,123,,
798,0.97,6093.854,6096.39,I know there will be more as we go through this process.,123,,
799,0.97,6096.39,6104.598,"For Sdot and for whichever of those you'd like to tackle now, feel free.",123,,
800,0.97,6104.598,6107.201,"Yeah, thank you, Councilmember.",124,,
801,0.97,6107.201,6109.97,Great questions.,124,,
802,0.97,6109.97,6124.017,"And just on a point where we'll respond to each of those during this meeting, okay?",124,,
803,0.97,6124.017,6125.719,You don't have to respond to each one now.,124,,
804,0.97,6125.719,6127.888,We are just getting it out on the public record.,124,,
805,0.97,6127.888,6131.492,"Then, when Sdot comes back, we'd definitely like to hear a response when you come back.",124,,
806,0.97,6131.492,6143.036,"But Ideally you get those sooner, the answer sooner.",124,,
807,0.97,6143.437,6145.506,"Maybe you can put them on your Blog, Sdot Blog.",124,,
808,0.97,6145.506,6146.373,That would be helpful.,124,,
809,0.97,6146.373,6149.977,"But to the extent you're able to answer any right now, that would be great.",124,,
810,0.97,6149.977,6150.978,Even if they're partial answers.,124,,
811,0.97,6150.978,6153.08,So I think I'll take the first two.,125,,
812,0.97,6153.08,6153.714,The third question.,125,,
813,0.97,6153.714,6182.843,"So in terms of safety and the bicycle and pedestrian safety analysis and how we are using that, it's definitely the case that our safety goal of zero fatalities and serious injuries is a key performance track that we want",125,,
814,0.97,6499.359,6509.135,"Jonathan, in regards to evaluating reporting and policies, I'm going to hand it back over to you.",126,,
815,0.97,6509.135,6517.978,"Okay, the questions said how we are building on our existing modal plans, is that right?",127,,
816,0.97,6517.978,6520.847,"This might be an off-line conversation, but I'm curious about how you're monitoring.",128,,
817,0.97,6520.847,6535.328,Like what is the evaluation process and how are you tracking your own Metrics to make sure that you're achieving for that you need to course correct?,128,,
818,0.97,6535.328,6536.096,That's a great question.,129,,
819,0.97,6536.096,6551.611,"I think from an outsider's perspective, it could be hard, you're a Councilmember, but for the folks watching at home it can be hard to figure out where are the different places we track our progress.",129,,
820,0.97,6551.611,6562.856,"The main place is in a report called moving the needle, and there we monitor through an annual report our progress on many of our Metrics.",129,,
821,0.97,6562.856,6573.533,"And seeing if you're from the community and you just want a one-stop shop, that's probably the easiest thing to find in reference.",129,,
822,0.97,6573.533,6594.321,"But then inside many of our programs, many of the programs are lost with performance measures, so our vision zero program, our bike implementation program, our pedestrian program, and they have Metrics that are anchored to--and many of them issue an annual or biannual report that track their progress.",129,,
823,0.97,6594.321,6617.243,"So if there's something specifically interested, we could help connect them, but a lot of those are drawn directly from our modal master plans, the bike plan or the pedestrian plan, or the move Seattle strategic vision document.",129,,
824,0.97,6617.243,6619.446,This is where a lot of those come from.,129,,
825,0.97,6619.446,6627.454,We surveyed our current plans and we found 300 performance measures.,129,,
826,0.97,6627.454,6633.259,What we didn't do this check to see are we tracking against all of those?,129,,
827,0.97,6633.259,6634.327,That's an awfully big number.,129,,
828,0.97,6634.327,6645.772,"We do track many of them but I think we are interested, a lot of them are pointed in the same direction.",129,,
829,0.97,6645.772,6651.277,"Or Duplicates of, so we are looking at opportunities to do some alignment and integration of our performance measure landscape.",129,,
830,0.97,6651.277,6655.148,So it's easier to keep an eye on things and help us track our progress.,129,,
831,0.97,6655.148,6658.351,I think the last question --,129,,
832,0.97,6658.351,6665.692,"I don't know if Calvin chow has any comment at this point, or question.",130,,
833,0.97,6665.692,6682.008,"Councilmembers, I kind of wanted to just reiterate that the transportation plan is a planning and policy document, and it will include an implementation and funding strategy.",131,,
834,0.97,6682.008,6684.911,"But those implementation measures, that's sort of where the rubber hits the road.",131,,
835,0.97,6684.911,6689.749,What are we going to go out with to voters as a proposal for the next package in the levy.,131,,
836,0.97,6689.749,6696.056,That's typically where we do some of our Metrics for what are we delivering and how are we achieving?,131,,
837,0.97,6696.056,6707.0,So a lot of what this work will be doing is trying to establish what we will be measuring against as we go into the next several years of transportation and investments.,131,,
838,0.97,6707.0,6720.947,"I just wanted to reiterate that because there are the implementation steps that will have to come to make this reality, I guess is the thing I wanted to highlight.",131,,
839,0.97,6720.947,6721.715,Thank you.,132,,
840,0.97,6721.715,6725.652,"Jonathan, go ahead and continue.",132,,
841,0.97,6725.652,6728.521,I think you're addressing Councilmember Mireles's question.,132,,
842,0.97,6728.521,6730.523,A couple more questions Ústill.,133,,
843,0.97,6730.523,6742.068,"One of them was about integrating the modal plans, trying not to have competition among our priority of modes.",133,,
844,0.97,6742.068,6756.616,"I think we have four modal master plans, as I mentioned, for walking, Biking, transit and freight and our company has a plan, this is getting policy Wonky, I'm sorry, is our already of modes and should have Right-Of-Way priority.",133,,
845,0.97,6756.616,6768.728,"I think several folks on the calls this morning, and we've heard many times that it feels like those formats are in competition with each other.",133,,
846,0.97,6768.728,6781.307,And it's another underpinning of why we are doing an integrated plan is to try to create more integration and less competition across those priority modes.,133,,
847,0.97,6781.307,6807.1,"Will we get to a point where we don't have Trade-Off conversations in the city, we will not get there, but we want to create some additional policy items, more clarity, and minimize the--for lack of a better word, the Streetfighting that goes on when we are waiting these difficult Trade- offs.",133,,
848,0.97,6807.1,6822.615,"And really, we want to think about, when we are making those Trade-Offs, how can we help that conversation be anchored to our core values around planet action, safety, stewardship, and a more equitable transportation system?",133,,
849,0.97,6822.615,6831.09,Our question was about our relationship to the strategy.,133,,
850,0.97,6831.09,6837.797,"So I don't want to speak for the comprehensive plan team, but we are working closely with them.",133,,
851,0.97,6837.797,6842.836,"They will be developing some alternatives, Land-Use alternatives that they study.",133,,
852,0.97,6842.836,6846.906,I think some of those actually were directed by Council.,133,,
853,0.97,6846.906,6857.083,"And we are still in the yearly conversation around that, as I understand it, but they'll be looking at Maybe some new growth target areas.",133,,
854,0.97,6857.083,6859.052,They'll be looking at potential city widest changes.,133,,
855,0.97,6859.052,6862.755,We will be studying how to keep a conversation about that.,133,,
856,0.97,6862.755,6878.605,"We feel like our role is to help whatever Council and Department and the Mayor want to grow, the growth strategy would want to cultivate a transportation strategy that helps for all of the success.",133,,
857,0.97,6878.605,6880.573,So we are working closely with them.,133,,
858,0.97,6880.573,6890.917,"Think about we might need to Prioritize new transit investments and might need to see systems of bike lanes and sidewalks and things like that, to help make that a success.",133,,
859,0.97,6890.917,6895.121,We are working closely with them.,133,,
860,0.97,6895.121,6902.829,Some of our groups of respective teams meeting a couple times a week to improve coordination and cooperation across the planning process is.,133,,
861,0.97,6902.829,6903.696,Thank you.,134,,
862,0.97,6903.696,6909.936,I see Councilmember Herbold's hand.,134,,
863,0.97,6909.936,6910.436,Councilmember Herbold.,134,,
864,0.97,6910.436,6914.941,Thank you very much.,135,,
865,0.97,6914.941,6927.921,"This question may have been answered in the discussion of the modal plan, but I didn't hear it and historically there's been an annual implementation plan for each of the modal plans.",135,,
866,0.97,6927.921,6939.599,What is going to serve that function moving forward?,135,,
867,0.97,6939.599,6946.539,"Joanna, I'm not sure if I should answer this one, or you?",136,,
868,0.97,6946.539,6982.175,"Jonathan, you can probably Tagteam this one in regards to what we were envisioning is really being able to--we are excited to be able to Holistically look at it and engage in those conversations, as Jonathan mentioned, to resolving some of the conflicts and items, so what he's envisioned, as Calvin also mentioned in regards to implementation strategy, what this looks like, and in a project list that can be thinking Holistically like a corridor type approach.",137,,
869,0.97,6982.175,6986.746,"Councilmember Herbold, that could be bike, pedestrian corridors, or something, as an example.",137,,
870,0.97,6986.746,6992.919,"And then as part of that, there could be packaging of some sort of documentation or project list.",137,,
871,0.97,6992.919,6998.191,Another item is combined with availability of funding.,137,,
872,0.97,6998.191,7012.805,"Developing a strategy around year implementation, like a short-term sort of implementation strategy, and a middle term implementation strategy, and a long-term.",137,,
873,0.97,7012.805,7025.284,"You can divide that up, really tying it with the CIP process from zero to 60 sort of approach, 6 to 10 and 10 and beyond in regards to a kind of more visionary sort of implementation.",137,,
874,0.97,7025.284,7071.33,"But in regards to that, it's kind of what we are envisioning in regards to the implementation, and what implementation plans would fit into the Stp conversation and the vision for being able to look at our whole transportation system, and how we are tackling all the different modes and uses, and we've been talking a lot about the street use, so one of the other components of this Stp is people public space thinking in regards to just how our community also experiences the Right-Of-Way and providing good spaces.",137,,
875,0.97,7071.33,7082.308,I think there was a comment that was made earlier in regards to transit and the hubs and the safety at those locations.,137,,
876,0.97,7082.308,7090.45,"So we are excited to be able to think about this space, as well, in addition to how travel occurs in our Right-Of-Way.",137,,
877,0.97,7090.45,7091.651,"Jonathan, please walk through that.",137,,
878,0.97,7091.651,7092.318,If I missed anything,137,,
879,0.97,7092.318,7099.459,It looks like someone has something to add.,138,,
880,0.97,7099.459,7105.631,I think Council is going to want to pay attention to that going forward.,139,,
881,0.97,7105.631,7116.509,"If we use that particular he budget, it gives us some confidence that it's been Vetted, it is consistent with the plan.",139,,
882,0.97,7116.509,7120.847,It's definitely something we want to understand how it's going to be handled under the Stp.,139,,
883,0.97,7120.847,7125.985,"Thank you, Captain.",140,,
884,0.97,7125.985,7131.657,I think Councilmember Strauss may have some questions and comments.,141,,
885,0.97,7131.657,7132.258,Councilmember Strauss?,141,,
886,0.97,7132.258,7133.025,"Thank you, chair.",142,,
887,0.97,7133.025,7134.961,"Thank you, Jonathan, and Johanna.",142,,
888,0.97,7134.961,7142.235,"This is been a really robust conversation, and I was wondering if you could cycle back to slide six.",142,,
889,0.97,7142.235,7150.943,Really appreciate the page numbers on your slides.,142,,
890,0.97,7150.943,7166.192,"This is great, and I really appreciate, and I see that there's a difference between the Powerpoint loaded up on the to Star in the Powerpoint for you with the four different plans, and that fourth plan being a truck rather than a car.",142,,
891,0.97,7166.192,7170.062,And the reason why that's so important is because cars have the ability to accelerate and decelerate weekly.,142,,
892,0.97,7170.062,7180.139,"They have smaller turning radius is, so our plan really does need to be for these larger vehicles, not for cars.",142,,
893,0.97,7180.139,7186.579,I really appreciate the change we see there.,142,,
894,0.97,7186.579,7194.32,I'm just going to highlight a couple things that Councilmember Morales said.,142,,
895,0.97,7194.32,7202.828,"Her questions are very similar to questions that I have, which is how do we get to vision zero, how do we address climate crisis, and how do we ensure that we are building for all ages and abilities?",142,,
896,0.97,7202.828,7211.771,"And I'll raise this, that we have the opportunity, even though there is limited Right- Of-Way and in some places all four of these plans have to work together, we have the ability to work in collaboration and put modes in conflict.",142,,
897,0.97,7211.771,7215.808,"Sometimes that just means keeping everyone in their Lane, and I know that that's easier said than done.",142,,
898,0.97,7215.808,7225.117,"And when we are able to provide the space in our streets, and designate the room we need, where people need to be, that keeps them out of conflict.",142,,
899,0.97,7225.117,7230.556,I know this from having been hit by a driver and spending four days at Harborview.,142,,
900,0.97,7230.556,7232.925,So that vision zero aspect is just very important to me.,142,,
901,0.97,7232.925,7246.005,"And I think that the way that we are able to meet vision zero, we are able to meet our freight goals, our transit goals, all of these is by ensuring that each mode has a connective network.",142,,
902,0.97,7246.005,7255.881,For people riding their bikes that means that they don't have to cross high-level stress zones without that proper infrastructure.,142,,
903,0.97,7255.881,7270.73,"For buses and for freight that means making sure that they don't get stuck in an intersection that they can't get through, or they don't get stuck being required to make a turn that they can't make.",142,,
904,0.97,7270.73,7276.135,So these connective networks really is how we are going to be able to get there.,142,,
905,0.97,7276.135,7280.906,"And again, my hope, and I think the hope is shared by you, that we make this a collaboration rather than a conflict.",142,,
906,0.97,7280.906,7288.447,"Understanding that transportation is our second largest driver of the climate crisis, we have to get moving quickly.",142,,
907,0.97,7288.447,7322.448,"We need to ensure that freight is moving freely, so that it's not idling in our city, and its center of mind for me, and I hope colleagues, it's center of mind for you as well, as we try to build toward our 15 minute city where people are able to walk in any neighborhood to get everything that they need, that's only possible if freight is able to move into these communities, because there's no way to buy a Gatorade or a coffee if the freight can't get to that store to make that delivery.",142,,
908,0.97,7322.448,7324.183,And similar to freight is the freight of people.,142,,
909,0.97,7324.183,7324.85,Our transit systems.,142,,
910,0.97,7324.85,7344.77,"And what's really important in this work is that we uplift the transit plan, because it's my understanding, and I've got a couple questions, I promised the chair, so Jonathan, when we get to my questions here, just understanding, it's my understanding that the transit plan is the oldest plan of all four of these.",142,,
911,0.97,7344.77,7347.807,Is that correct?,142,,
912,0.97,7347.807,7348.674,It sounds right.,143,,
913,0.97,7348.674,7359.418,The climate plan and the transit plan are most the most out of date and transit definitely feels most out of date.,143,,
914,0.97,7359.418,7377.369,"Right, because Bicycling technology and planning hasn't changed so much in 10 years.",144,,
915,0.97,7377.87,7383.609,"However, 10 years ago, when we were looking at transit, we weren't even thinking about--I don't even think St 3 is on our transit plan.",144,,
916,0.97,7383.609,7389.081,"And here we are in this Committee, just maybe two committees ago, we are having to draft environmental impact statement Re-Presented to us about transit.",144,,
917,0.97,7389.081,7392.351,So in this plan it is important that we are not just planning for buses.,144,,
918,0.97,7392.351,7423.849,"It's that we are not just planning for sound transit 4, because we now have the ability to go to voters to ask them for transit dollars so that we can accelerate sound transit three and so we can build the train network that we need in our city, so that we are able to take people off of our streets and still get them around town in a mode that people enjoy to use, that is reliable both by experience and by timing, so that you know when you're going to get where you're going when you leave home.",144,,
919,0.97,7423.849,7428.621,"I just want to make sure, have we considered this, the rail aspect of our transit plan?",144,,
920,0.97,7428.621,7437.396,"What is the plan for buses and how do we support the connective Spines, but also the connective expansions?",144,,
921,0.97,7437.396,7456.882,"And I guess the conversation for the public and for you is what do we want our light rail system to look like, because this conversation is going to drive where we go.",144,,
922,0.97,7456.882,7459.518,"So with that I will turn it back to you, Jonathan.",144,,
923,0.97,7459.518,7464.924,"Thank you for letting me have a moment to share my thoughts, mostly because Councilmember Morales beat me to my question.",144,,
924,0.97,7464.924,7465.991,So I appreciate a few words.,144,,
925,0.97,7465.991,7466.892,"Thank you, Councilmember.",145,,
926,0.97,7466.892,7476.735,"I think to the community engagement, those are key questions we also want to be asking the public, how can we best serve the existing transit system and how can we continue to grow that system.",145,,
927,0.97,7476.735,7494.22,"I think you're absolutely right, our transit plan is roughly out of date and doesn't update St 3, which is the sound transit, the big sound transit program to have stations in the city and South Graham.",145,,
928,0.97,7494.22,7500.893,"Along with investments in some of our corridors, our best rapid transit corridors.",145,,
929,0.97,7500.893,7514.64,"So I think we are excited to have update on that modal, what's listed here on our priority in bus conflicts.",145,,
930,0.97,7514.64,7531.724,These are the targets for where we want to be making these walking and Biking investments for infrastructure to serve those things and thinking about it takes just dropping a station into a neighborhood is just the tip of getting the best usage out of that station.,145,,
931,0.97,7531.724,7542.735,"And that's sound transit's role, to keep the trains running on time.",145,,
932,0.97,7542.735,7567.793,"It's a partnership across our agencies, with Metro, on getting bus service to reliably serve, creating ways for people to walk and bike to those stations and continue to target growth around light rail . It's a huge, huge investment, billions of dollars being invested in light rail in our city and some of the plan around each and every station to get the most value and transportation service we can out of each of these stations.",145,,
933,0.97,7567.793,7587.112,"A really great point and a conversation we are excited with the community, and our transit plan has helped shape and target where we would like to invest, the city invests in transit as well through the district.",145,,
934,0.97,7587.112,7590.316,We purchase extra bus service.,145,,
935,0.97,7590.316,7596.789,We make investments in the Red bus only lanes and other ways to keep buses moving quickly.,145,,
936,0.97,7596.789,7604.363,So this plan will help us Prioritize this.,145,,
937,0.97,7604.363,7612.838,"Thank you, icy Councilmember Morales has her hand up.",146,,
938,0.97,7612.838,7616.875,Thanks.,147,,
939,0.97,7616.875,7617.276,Last comment.,147,,
940,0.97,7617.276,7620.813,"First, I just want to thank Jonathan and Joanna for being here, for answering all these Úquestions.",147,,
941,0.97,7620.813,7641.934,"I think what you're hearing from community and from us is that we really just want to see a plan that will include the details, demonstrate the details that we need to see to know that we are going to reduce our carbon emissions, we are going to increase safety, and that this plan is really going to move Seattle into the 21st century, instead of keeping the sort of anchored in the Eisenhower era.",147,,
942,0.97,7641.934,7645.704,So look forward to working with you all over the next year.,147,,
943,0.97,7645.704,7646.105,Thank you.,147,,
944,0.97,7646.105,7650.142,"Thank you, Councilmember.",148,,
945,0.97,7650.142,7668.861,"My question is since the particular focus in this presentation today is about how Sdot is going to start their outreach and engagement, and listen to the public, Coincidentally, I had a briefing recently from Seattle parks and recreation Department.",148,,
946,0.97,7668.861,7673.499,They're actually doing and outreach and engagement strategy for their spending plan for the parks district that's coming up for renewal.,148,,
947,0.97,7673.499,7712.204,"Not renewal, but for us to say how we'd like to invest those dollars, and in addition to hearing from small focus groups that are very familiar with particular mode of transportation, or in this case particular park usage or community center uses, for recreational programming, they are doing, in addition to those focus groups, they are doing a statistically valid surveys of the public, so they apparently do that every two years, anyway.",148,,
948,0.97,7712.204,7733.292,"So by asking hundreds of survey respondents their zip codes, race, income, abilities, parities, then you could obtain cross tabs of the priorities of different groups that focus on what is it that low income residents are seeking or Prioritizing by doing the survey.",148,,
949,0.97,7733.292,7734.359,It will help to inform that.,148,,
950,0.97,7734.359,7749.541,"So just wanted to note because as part of your outreach and engagement strategy, are you doing any statistical balance or vein?",148,,
951,0.97,7749.541,7750.909,"Thanks for your question, Councilmember Pedersen.",149,,
952,0.97,7750.909,7753.212,We are exploring statistically valid surveys as a tool to use.,149,,
953,0.97,7753.212,7778.937,"Additionally, as part of the survey that we have out right now, due to our title VI requirements, which allows us to collect a lot of information around demographics including zip code, we are collecting that information, and those are some of the methods we are using to make sure that we are able to track who we are hearing from, and again, Pivot as needed in order to ensure that we are working right from our representative community.",149,,
954,0.97,7778.937,7790.382,"So definitely will have all those items in our two blocks and will continue to track and just put it as needed, as well, to ensure that all our voices are represented.",149,,
955,0.97,7790.382,7792.851,Thank you very much.,150,,
956,0.97,7792.851,7803.328,"Thank you for being here today and also for the work you're doing to do that outreach, and put together the plan.",150,,
957,0.97,7803.328,7821.713,"So I know we'll be touching base frequently over the next year of this . all right, colleagues.",150,,
958,0.97,7821.713,7826.885,"Well, thank you for all being here today, and this concludes the March 15, 2022 meeting of the transportation and Seattle public utilities committee.",150,,
959,0.97,7826.885,7830.989,"We anticipate that our next meeting will be on Tuesday, April 5. thank you, and we are adjourned.",150,,
960,0.97,7840.499,7843.902,[,151,,
