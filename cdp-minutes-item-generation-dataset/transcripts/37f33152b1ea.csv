613,0.8224497437477112,3088.6,3098.0,"So the question now is why, you know, appreciate the commitment to wanting to see hand washing facilities, but it wasn't a question of what type of innovative strategies?",,,
614,0.8224497437477112,3098.0,3099.6,Can we couple this with it?,,,
615,0.8224497437477112,3099.6,3105.8,"Was how fast can get this dollars out to do very low cost already, proven hand washing techniques.",,,
616,0.8224497437477112,3105.8,3112.3,"And so I'd like to ask that the front of this meeting, where are the hand washing facilities, and why is it taking so long?",,,

619,0.8989129662513733,3123.1,3128.4,But it does take a little bit of detail just in terms of what the timeline is.,,,

726,0.8562620282173157,3967.8,3976.2,We have to consider which of these things are legal issues that are beyond the power of the city to rectify.,,,
727,0.8562620282173157,3976.3,3980.5,"I mean, that would be like ADA compliance very clearly, but maybe there's some other things.",,,
728,0.8562620282173157,3980.5,3981.8,So that's my first question.,,,
729,0.8562620282173157,3982.4,3987.8,Second question to what extent can the council through emergency legislation.,,,
730,0.8055124282836914,3987.9,4000.8," Legislation or code revisions, create exceptions for temporary hygiene facilities and things like the Seattle, plumbing code, for example, or to what extent would that be preempted by state law?",,,
731,0.8055124282836914,4001.0,4002.3,So that's my second question.,,,
732,0.8055124282836914,4003.1,4012.1,Then my third question is how many of these things are highly desirable but could be waived by either yourself or someone in the executive department.,,,
733,0.8055124282836914,4012.1,4017.8,"So that would be a question for example, about I would imagine things like the freeze protection.",,,
734,0.91095370054245,4018.0,4026.1," In which is a seasonal concern, you know that that won't be relevant during the summer but certainly would be relevant in the late fall in the winter.",,,
735,0.91095370054245,4026.6,4040.8,So could you maybe just answer as to those three questions as we kind of sift through the considerations and the chart to know like what we got overcome and and what's within our power to sort of,,,
736,0.9004060626029968,4041.6,4045.6," You know, bend the rules a little bit here, given that we're in a hygiene emergency.",,,
737,0.9004060626029968,4045.6,4046.6,Sure.,,,
738,0.9004060626029968,4046.6,4068.2,"We can give you a pretty quickly, you know, a good analysis of you know, each of those levels of governance and you know, which ones are obligatory and which are just, you know, desirable, but for the general question about, what do we need to wave, you know, at this point.",,,
739,0.9004060626029968,4068.2,4071.5,I'm not sure if it's necessary in order.,,,
740,0.7374135851860046,4071.6,4080.9, To deliver on the program since the timeframe is that we would be granting by the end of the month and Contracting and the beginning of June.,,,
741,0.7374135851860046,4081.8,4097.1,So it might be that you would be looking to waive requirements in our find some way to get around them if the submissions do not conform right?,,,
742,0.7374135851860046,4097.1,4100.6,So that might be something that we want to discuss.,,,
743,0.7374135851860046,4100.6,4101.4,And so we can we can,,,
744,0.9054605960845947,4101.5,4103.6, Provide you with that background information very quickly.,,,
745,0.9054605960845947,4103.6,4105.0,Sure.,,,
746,0.9054605960845947,4105.0,4105.7,I'd appreciate that.,,,
747,0.9054605960845947,4105.7,4112.2,"I mean, the subtext of my question was was that, you know, I've read, you know, like Natalie G coverage in the press.",,,
748,0.9054605960845947,4112.2,4126.5,"For example in the stranger that some of the things in this chart have led to the Clean Hands Collective potentially not being able to stand up there sinks, which of course was the council's intent here.",,,
749,0.9054605960845947,4126.5,4131.3,"So, you know, I am just curious to the extent that of how much of this is.",,,
750,0.8038272857666016,4131.6,4142.7," And then stone versus how much of this is permissible, and I guess I'm flagging that also for Central staff, and for the Law Department, if they're watching too, but I look forward to those answers.",,,
751,0.8038272857666016,4142.7,4147.8,"CEO, her and appreciate your responsiveness to that.",,,
752,0.8038272857666016,4148.2,4150.7,"So, we got a whole bunch of questions.",,,
753,0.8038272857666016,4150.8,4151.8,Do they pertain to this?,,,
754,0.8038272857666016,4151.8,4153.0,If they pertain to this chart?,,,
755,0.8038272857666016,4153.0,4154.7,I'll certainly start calling on folks.,,,
756,0.8038272857666016,4154.7,4158.8,"So councilmember Mesquita followed by counsel Morales, followed by councillor of Peters.",,,
757,0.7738282084465027,4159.6,4160.1," Thank you, mr.",,,
758,0.7738282084465027,4160.1,4161.2,"Chair, and I'll keep it brief.",,,
759,0.7738282084465027,4161.9,4163.9,Your questions are exactly the same as my question.,,,
760,0.7738282084465027,4163.9,4169.8,I want to point out that we obviously all have a shared goal of making sure that our facilities and our buildings.,,,
761,0.7738282084465027,4169.8,4171.4,Our structures are ADA Compliant.,,,
762,0.7738282084465027,4171.4,4172.4,There's no doubt there.,,,
763,0.7738282084465027,4172.7,4177.3,But look what we've done in the last year for restaurants and outdoor dining.,,,
764,0.7738282084465027,4177.4,4189.2,"I know for a fact that not every one of those outdoor facilities that I've been to or probably ADA Compliant, but we're working towards a goal of making sure that our city is able to sustain that folks are safe.",,,
765,0.7721778154373169,4189.4,4191.0, Able to have a place to go.,,,
766,0.7721778154373169,4191.4,4193.2,Hand washing is Paramount here.,,,
767,0.7721778154373169,4193.3,4200.8,And I think that it would have been incredibly important to look at what those options were to wave some things that were nice to have.,,,
768,0.7721778154373169,4200.8,4204.8,I think it would have been imperative to have worked towards standing up these things.,,,
769,0.7721778154373169,4204.8,4212.2,"With the goal of creating more ada-accessible, come compliant situations because no sink is far worse than having a sink.",,,
770,0.7721778154373169,4212.2,4214.5,"That doesn't, maybe neat.",,,
771,0.7721778154373169,4214.5,4217.5,Your gray water situation in one or two places.,,,
772,0.7721778154373169,4217.7,4219.3,People didn't have sinks for the,,,
773,0.8783630728721619,4219.4,4220.8, six months since they've been funded.,,,
774,0.8783630728721619,4220.8,4224.4,So I'm just underscoring councilmember Lewis's important Point.,,,
775,0.8783630728721619,4224.4,4224.9,Here.,,,
776,0.8783630728721619,4225.1,4234.9,"We are in a pandemic, still, if there is to be rolling, either epidemics, that crop out of covid or future efforts.",,,
777,0.8783630728721619,4234.9,4236.9,We cannot have this type of delay again.,,,
778,0.8783630728721619,4236.9,4244.1,"And again, I want to go back to the frustration that I think I'm expressing that there was a specific strategy that was funded legislatively.",,,
779,0.8783630728721619,4244.1,4248.3,The legislative branch ask for a specific approach and now we are here.,,,
780,0.8783630728721619,4248.3,4249.1,Six months later.,,,

782,0.7954925894737244,4249.4,4251.2, Not a different sort of strategy.,,,
783,0.7954925894737244,4251.6,4255.7,And I think that a little bit more creativity is needed in the moment of a pandemic.,,,
784,0.7954925894737244,4255.7,4263.4,"When washing hands is the number one thing that the CDC recommends, in addition to mass and social distancing, that could have stabilized.",,,

787,0.8868821859359741,4282.8,4293.8,"So, you know, I, you know, I I share that concern, you know, I the issue about no sink versus is it?",,,

810,0.7846817970275879,4439.7,4454.5,So so I I understand there's a dissonance and I also worry that there's a lot of hand-wringing over what are really standard utility issues that we should have anticipated and could have worked through,,,
811,0.9015185236930847,4454.6,4473.4," Quicker, so, you know, I'm hoping that we can get this process moving that the next time we try to do something that is innovative and has a really acute has the potential to have an acute public health impact that we don't tarry as they say.",,,

863,0.7630111575126648,4784.9,4786.7,"We could go to the next slide, please.",,,
864,0.8687512278556824,4790.6,4818.5," so we are just very briefly describe the second area of the grant program, the waste prevention and solutions the this element addresses, a hopes to address food waste and other materials reuse, and Seattle has increasingly prioritized based prevent and reuse as a key strategy to reducing the impacts of you know,",,,
865,0.8236270546913147,4818.7,4821.5, Kinds of materials on the environment and human health.,,,
866,0.8236270546913147,4822.0,4827.8,And so we're seeking applications to help minimize illegal dumping trash and litter.,,,
867,0.8236270546913147,4828.5,4835.1,"And, you know, it's no, I think surprised that it is an issue.",,,
868,0.8236270546913147,4835.2,4848.5,"You know, that's, that's accelerated during the pandemic and, you know, it's also been an issue that, you know, people not having access to sufficient food during the pandemic.",,,
869,0.8049116730690002,4848.9,4850.5," You know, particularly houseless folks.",,,
870,0.8049116730690002,4851.0,4871.7,"And so, you know, we were aiming to try to, you know, bring this element into in the spirit of abetting, those who are volunteering anyway, and to see if there were other kinds of activities that would help to complement the the the other sink work, which we consider to also be, you know, Mutual Aid effort.",,,
871,0.7422071695327759,4876.5,4881.8," Yeah, and so this is going to quickly go over the spu, Indio and partnership.",,,
872,0.7422071695327759,4881.8,4894.2,"Which many of you know, is Central to the work that the department of neighborhoods is doing over the last couple of years, which is combining with our more operational infrastructure, departments to augment and partner with their Outreach and engagement.",,,
873,0.7422071695327759,4894.2,4896.9,"In this case, in the grant development.",,,
874,0.7422071695327759,4897.7,4905.8,And as councilmember Morales mentioned bringing things like smaller grants that are more accessible in readily.,,,
875,0.8853591680526733,4906.4,4926.2," Able to be implemented by smaller nonprofits, lowering the barriers for accessing opportunities, really pairing the grant cycle with not just an application but really with ongoing technical assistance that may be more mirrors something that we would see as part of like neighborhood matching fund or the new healthy food fund.",,,
876,0.8853591680526733,4926.6,4932.0,"And then finally, I would say that really bringing all of the resources and relationships of Department of neighborhoods.",,,
877,0.8853591680526733,4932.0,4936.0,"Through all of our staff, our community engagement coordinators or Community Liaisons.",,,
878,0.8254189491271973,4936.4,4952.3, And so forth to bear in this industry relationship and so our hope is that we can continue to do more things like this that our community centered in this way and Community initiated and not just with this pu with with some are other departments as well.,,,
879,0.8377332091331482,4954.9,4955.7, Thank you.,,,
880,0.8377332091331482,4956.5,4961.3,"Thanks for the presentation, really appreciated and customer Peterson.",,,
881,0.8377332091331482,4961.3,4965.1,I appreciate you and dodging this committee.,,,
882,0.8377332091331482,4965.1,4969.8,"And letting us take this presentation here, knowing that typically SP reports to your committee.",,,
883,0.8377332091331482,4971.7,4975.3,"You, I just want to say, we open it up for questions in a second.",,,
884,0.8377332091331482,4975.3,4981.2,If other council members have questions and and some of this has sort of been echoed already.,,,
885,0.8377332091331482,4982.1,4983.3,But I mean I,,,
886,0.8550506830215454,4983.5,5013.3," I'll just candidly say that it is a little frustrating given, you know, Sitting On The Board of Health, hearing the presentations from Board of Health on a regular basis on the horrific hygiene situation and so many communities of unhoused folks in the city that could be extremely easily prevented with access to running water and just being in a position where it feels like there's a lot of hurdles here for us to accomplish the goal.",,,
887,0.8077622652053833,5013.4,5035.3," Collectively as a council as an SP you to get these stood up, you know, I think that chart earlier in the presentation was extremely helpful and sort of centering it and sort of where I want to leave it and the Crux of the questions that I asked earlier was I want us to look outside of the of those barriers as being determined.",,,
888,0.8077622652053833,5035.3,5043.3,Itive and a path that leads to less desirable and less efficacious hygiene policies to comply.,,,
889,0.8142762780189514,5043.6,5045.7, Squarely with all of those regulations.,,,
890,0.8142762780189514,5045.7,5052.1,I'd rather look for a way that we can work as an SP you and a council to respond to this.,,,
891,0.8142762780189514,5052.1,5054.2,The same way that we've responded to Streeter.,,,
892,0.8142762780189514,5054.2,5063.9,"He's for restaurants the same way that we've respond to responded to, you know, meeting having these meetings remotely.",,,
893,0.8142762780189514,5063.9,5067.9,"I mean, we were making all sorts of temporary adaptations.",,,
894,0.8142762780189514,5068.5,5072.1,To how work is typically done to respond to the unique.,,,
895,0.8404448628425598,5073.4,5079.8, Saints of This Global pandemic and that gives us a lot more flexibility which we've seen.,,,
896,0.8404448628425598,5079.8,5085.8,"I mean, we have seen, we have put moratoriums and suspensions on evictions for several months.",,,
897,0.8404448628425598,5086.6,5091.3,"We have capped, emergency delivery fees.",,,
898,0.8404448628425598,5091.3,5101.8,"We've assessed Hazard, pay for workers all things held up in court because it's a pandemic and we have special emergency Powers.",,,
899,0.8404448628425598,5102.2,5103.3,So I,,,
900,0.9023029208183289,5103.4,5110.9," Just like to, you know, I mean, I'm like, I'm looking right now at the Seattle, Clean Hands Collective Street sink website, build at the top.",,,
901,0.9023029208183289,5110.9,5113.8,The street sink makes hand-washing easy and accessible for anyone.,,,
902,0.9023029208183289,5113.8,5119.3,Anywhere seems like there could be a way to adapt that to meet with some Elevate.,,,
903,0.9023029208183289,5119.3,5123.4,"You Novation, working together to adapt and meet the ADA requirements.",,,
904,0.9023029208183289,5123.4,5126.1,Definitely have to do.,,,
905,0.9023029208183289,5126.1,5128.3,Some troubleshooting around the gray water issue.,,,
906,0.9023029208183289,5128.3,5133.1,It doesn't seem completely and solvable the city for years has had,,,
907,0.8315208554267883,5133.4,5139.3, Add rain Garden programs where people can install Rain Garden drainage ditches.,,,
908,0.8315208554267883,5139.3,5140.5,And in neighborhoods.,,,
909,0.8315208554267883,5140.5,5143.0,I believe they were Department of neighborhood program.,,,
910,0.8315208554267883,5143.6,5150.4,So it just seems like there's a lot of Nexus is here with existing scope of work that the city does in some places.,,,
911,0.8315208554267883,5150.4,5159.1,"It seems like there could be ways that maybe we can work together to find more flexibility to, to accommodate Innovative designs.",,,
912,0.8315208554267883,5159.6,5163.2,I'm sure this Council would indulge request to wave.,,,
913,0.833148717880249,5163.4,5166.6, Temporarily any regulation required to get it done.,,,
914,0.833148717880249,5167.2,5169.1,And I just want to leave us with that.,,,
915,0.833148717880249,5169.8,5177.6,And in US joining you in having a problem-solving oriented approach to this.,,,
916,0.833148717880249,5177.6,5182.1,And I appreciate this presentation and breaking it down and I think we know what some of the clear.,,,
917,0.833148717880249,5182.1,5183.0,Next steps are.,,,
918,0.833148717880249,5184.3,5187.8,"But with that, I'll open it up for questions of colleagues.",,,
919,0.833148717880249,5187.8,5193.0,Want to add anything before we close this out with our guest today.,,,
920,0.8533821105957031,5198.8,5200.9," Okay, seeing no questions.",,,
921,0.8533821105957031,5201.1,5210.6,"If there's any closing remarks from the panelists, I'll open it back up before we move on to the next agenda.",,,
922,0.8533821105957031,5211.6,5215.3,I would suggest lecture customer Miss Cade.,,,
923,0.8533821105957031,5215.8,5216.1,I'm sorry.,,,
924,0.8533821105957031,5216.1,5217.6,I'm sorry to interrupt you.,,,
925,0.8533821105957031,5217.9,5218.6,Dr. Hajra.,,,
926,0.8533821105957031,5219.2,5220.6,I did have one more question.,,,
927,0.8533821105957031,5220.7,5228.5,So initially we had a hundred thousand dollars that were available part of that was because we did hear some concerns during the budget deliberations.,,,
928,0.861720085144043,5228.6,5231.3, Nations about the gray water issues and accessibility.,,,
929,0.861720085144043,5231.3,5232.8,"So, we added additional funds.",,,
930,0.861720085144043,5233.1,5240.2,So that technical assistance could be provided to the organization and with the hope that those would be expedited.,,,
931,0.861720085144043,5240.4,5240.9,I guess.,,,
932,0.861720085144043,5240.9,5248.1,"My question now is even if we're looking at 150,000, if we were talking about dividing that over a series of small organizations.",,,
933,0.861720085144043,5248.6,5252.7,I'm concerned about sort of the economy of scale how,,,
934,0.8663476705551147,5253.7,5264.1," How are these organizations supposed to stand up these sinks without a larger Grant of you know, 50 to 60 thousand dollars was the original request.",,,
935,0.9044211506843567,5265.7,5269.3, What are you anticipating in terms of the number total?,,,
936,0.9044211506843567,5270.1,5273.8,And how much are those organizations going to be receiving?,,,
937,0.7821217775344849,5275.4,5280.2, I don't know the full answer because we don't have the applications yet.,,,
938,0.7821217775344849,5281.1,5294.4,"You know, it is possible that one one respondent could get the full hundred thousand dollars allocated to the sink component of the program got have it.",,,
939,0.7821217775344849,5294.5,5294.7,Okay.,,,
940,0.7821217775344849,5294.7,5304.7,"Yeah, and and you know, the variables that will influence that have to do with this issue of flexibility that you are that that has been stressed, you know if there.",,,
941,0.7486065626144409,5304.9,5313.3," Respondents that are non compliant with the requirements, but council is interested in trying to find some other way than will have to do that.",,,
942,0.7486065626144409,5313.3,5317.1,"Work Pace before, you know a decision is made.",,,
943,0.7486065626144409,5317.8,5320.8,"And so we're here, you know to work with you on that.",,,
944,0.7486065626144409,5321.4,5331.0,"It may be that you might be interested in dividing that hundred thousand in some way, you know, in order to find out if you know, what is most efficacious through comparison.",,,
945,0.7486065626144409,5331.4,5334.7,"So, you know, we're available to talk about this at any",,,
946,0.7670383453369141,5334.8,5335.1, Time.,,,
947,0.7670383453369141,5335.1,5348.3,"And if there are any other, you know, any questions about technical aspects or, you know, aspects of the grant program itself, Kate Morrison who was just on the call is, is also available in her contact.",,,
948,0.7670383453369141,5348.3,5350.4,Information is on this slide.,,,
949,0.7670383453369141,5351.1,5351.3,Okay.,,,
950,0.7670383453369141,5351.3,5352.5,Thank you for that answer.,,,
951,0.7670383453369141,5352.5,5364.7,"That's that makes me hopeful especially because I want to make sure we're not giving you know, five to ten thousand dollars to organizations and asking them to work with the small amount of funding in terms of what's most efficacious that.",,,
952,0.8535901308059692,5364.9,5368.2, I use that word correctly in terms of efficacy.,,,
953,0.8535901308059692,5368.9,5370.9,I think just speaking for myself.,,,
954,0.8535901308059692,5370.9,5378.1,The biggest priority that I have is recognized in organizations that are ready to go right now versus doing a comparison.,,,
955,0.8535901308059692,5378.1,5379.5,So for whatever that's worth.,,,
956,0.8535901308059692,5379.5,5390.6,"I'm sure you've heard that through our comments already here today, but the X this speed at which we need to get these sink stood up, cannot be under scored further.",,,
957,0.9128385186195374,5391.6,5392.1, Thank you.,,,
958,0.9128385186195374,5392.7,5393.7,Thank you very much.,,,

960,0.8393020629882812,5397.2,5397.7,I'm aroused.,,,
961,0.8393020629882812,5397.7,5401.3,You have a closing question as the as well.,,,
962,0.8393020629882812,5401.6,5416.9,"Just a closing statement off of councilmember mosuke this comment, which is that the original budget was intended to be able to provide 63 hand sinks based on the clean hand Collective model.",,,
963,0.8393020629882812,5418.1,5425.3,And with the understanding that the point of this is to get as many sinks out as possible throughout the city in every District.,,,
964,0.8393020629882812,5425.7,5426.3,So that folks,,,
965,0.7967098951339722,5426.4,5430.1, Across the city have easy access to hand-washing facilities.,,,
966,0.7967098951339722,5430.1,5438.7,So so I just want to reiterate that because the point isn't to build super sinks and only be able to afford five of them.,,,
967,0.7967098951339722,5439.5,5442.6,The point is to get sinks out throughout the city.,,,
968,0.7967098951339722,5442.6,5444.7,So that folks have access to running water.,,,
969,0.9050429463386536,5449.6,5452.9," Okay, I think that's a good comment to close it out on.",,,
970,0.9050429463386536,5452.9,5459.4,"And again, all of us, appreciate councilmember, morales's Innovation and bringing this forward in the last budget cycle.",,,

1038,0.8691288232803345,5834.6,5835.2,Tess.,,,
1039,0.8691288232803345,5835.9,5839.2,The Hope team has several important functions.,,,
1040,0.8691288232803345,5839.6,5847.2,"I'm as test said, the first is to coordinate efforts by Outreach and shelter providers, as well as City departments.",,,
1041,0.8691288232803345,5847.6,5852.6,"We direct Outreach to respond, to areas of concern and individuals in need.",,,
1042,0.8691288232803345,5853.0,5859.3,"And we make shelter referrals, based on recommendations from Outreach providers to city-funded shelters.",,,
1043,0.8691288232803345,5860.1,5863.7,We provide on-site support for outreach providers at High.,,,
1044,0.7953802347183228,5864.0,5869.1," Already sites, which are determined by City departments, that own or manage public property.",,,
1045,0.7953802347183228,5869.8,5876.0,"And we partner with departments on encampment, litter and debris, mitigation efforts through the Clean Cities initiative.",,,
1046,0.7953802347183228,5876.9,5882.3,"And as test said, the Hope team does not schedule or lead and campement removal operations.",,,
1047,0.8159735202789307,5884.5,5900.1," When we think about how the Hope team, manages the shelter referral process for the set-aside shelter beds, we think about the starting point as being a Outreach provider working with and unsheltered person to assess their needs.",,,
1048,0.8159735202789307,5900.8,5903.2,The Hope team provides real-time shelter.,,,
1049,0.8159735202789307,5903.2,5905.8,Vacancy reports for those set aside beds.,,,
1050,0.8312729597091675,5906.8,5913.6," And then the hoop team receives shelter recommendations from Outreach providers for available, shelter, resources.",,,
1051,0.8312729597091675,5914.5,5921.0,"And finally, The Hope team connects those recommendations to open beds when a service match is made.",,,
1052,0.8312729597091675,5921.3,5925.9,"And when a service matches made, that's when a recommendation is now called a referral.",,,
1053,0.8676100969314575,5927.8,5933.8," When making referrals a person's vulnerabilities, are a driving factor, and hope team.",,,
1054,0.8676100969314575,5933.8,5940.5,Also prioritize recommendations that come from City Department identified high priority sites.,,,
1055,0.8465041518211365,5943.2,5958.0," And this diagram illustrates the referral process that I just described, you'll notice first Outreach engaging with an individual to identify their needs completing a shelter assessment and service match Outreach.",,,
1056,0.8465041518211365,5958.4,5961.6,Then relays the match recommendation to the Hope team.,,,
1057,0.8465041518211365,5962.6,5969.7,The hoop team turns recommendations and referrals again based on highest vulnerabilities and recommendations from high priority sites.,,,
1058,0.8465041518211365,5970.0,5971.8,"And when that referral is made the hole,",,,
1059,0.862564206123352,5972.0,5979.5," Team shares that information back to the art, which provider that made the recommendation as well as the shelter provider.",,,
1060,0.862564206123352,5979.5,5982.1,That will be receiving the person for intake.,,,
1061,0.862564206123352,5983.0,5984.2,And finally on the slide.,,,
1062,0.862564206123352,5984.2,5989.2,You'll notice when an individual moves into an enhanced shelter or tiny home Village.,,,
1063,0.862564206123352,5989.2,5994.4,"There are connected to wrap around services with the goal of helping them exit, to permanent housing.",,,
1064,0.8480268716812134,5998.8,6005.8," I couldn't go back for just a second, just for some clarifying questions that I want to try to hold questions to the end, including my own.",,,
1065,0.8480268716812134,6005.8,6009.9,But unless this is addressed later in the presentation.,,,
1066,0.8480268716812134,6009.9,6013.0,Could we dive down a little bit into?,,,
1067,0.8927603363990784,6014.2,6026.8," Kind of the definitions here of Rapid rehousing permanent, Supportive, Housing, housing, and diversion, just in sort of constituting what those resources are.",,,
1068,0.8927603363990784,6026.8,6033.7,And and maybe also how many resources that helped team has to offer those sorts of things right now.,,,
1069,0.9125747680664062,6036.7,6037.8," Yeah, absolutely.",,,
1070,0.9125747680664062,6038.4,6043.6,I'm happy to kick that off and Diana in case I need a little bit of your expertise.,,,
1071,0.9125747680664062,6044.0,6046.0,I'll ask you to stand by.,,,
1072,0.9125747680664062,6047.1,6056.3,"So first off to do that kind of quick, primer of the difference between diversion rapid rehousing and permanent Supportive Housing.",,,
1073,0.9125747680664062,6056.5,6065.5,So diversion really is a very effective intervention that helps people who are experiencing homelessness rapidly turn.,,,
1074,0.829104483127594,6066.0,6068.9, Back to a safe housing solution.,,,
1075,0.829104483127594,6069.3,6073.9,The goal of that really is to help folks not have to go into shelter.,,,
1076,0.829104483127594,6074.6,6085.9,"But to to assist them with brief case management and some financial support, if that's needed to really come up with a quick solution for their for their homelessness experience.",,,
1077,0.829104483127594,6086.9,6095.8,"Rapid rehousing is again, another intervention that is nationally recognized as",,,
1078,0.8291400074958801,6095.9,6103.3," A best practice, it provides some case management accompanied by rent.",,,
1079,0.8291400074958801,6103.3,6107.9,Support for folks to move back into housing.,,,
1080,0.8291400074958801,6108.4,6110.5,Typically in many cases.,,,
1081,0.8291400074958801,6110.5,6111.8,It's market-rate housing.,,,
1082,0.8291400074958801,6111.8,6125.8,"But in a lot of cases, we're able to support folks to get into an affordable housing project for example, and the goal really, with the rapid rehousing program is to provide both the financial assistance.",,,
1083,0.7062742114067078,6125.9,6129.9, And the case management to help folks stabilize in the in that housing.,,,
1084,0.7062742114067078,6130.6,6138.3,"We have found both in Seattle and King County, as well as nationally that roughly 85%.",,,
1085,0.7062742114067078,6138.3,6142.3,"Of the folks, who go through rapid rapid rehousing, do not return to the homeless system.",,,
1086,0.7062742114067078,6143.0,6149.6,"And then finally permanent Supportive Housing, which is a site based housing, whether it is a single site.",,,
1087,0.7062742114067078,6149.6,6152.3,And sometimes in some jurisdictions in cases.,,,
1088,0.7062742114067078,6152.3,6154.8,"It's scattered site, is",,,
1089,0.8620955348014832,6155.9,6164.2," You will the highest rung of housing in that it is permanent housing, folks, move in and there's no expectation.",,,
1090,0.8620955348014832,6164.2,6182.8,"That folks have to move out at any point and it comes with wraparound support services that are tailored to the needs of the individuals, typically permanent Supportive Housing serves a very highly vulnerable often chronically, chronic prop population.",,,
1091,0.8620955348014832,6182.8,6185.7,Folks who have been homeless for an extremely long period of time.,,,
1092,0.811145544052124,6187.3,6188.9, So council member Louis.,,,
1093,0.811145544052124,6188.9,6193.1,Does that get at the question about those three interventions?,,,
1094,0.811145544052124,6193.9,6194.4,Yes.,,,
1095,0.811145544052124,6194.5,6194.9,Thank you.,,,
1096,0.811145544052124,6195.2,6195.9,Good.,,,
1097,0.811145544052124,6195.9,6197.2,"Good, and I'm sorry.",,,
1098,0.811145544052124,6197.6,6202.2,Can you it turns out I cannot talk and chew gum at the same time.,,,
1099,0.811145544052124,6202.2,6210.2,Can you remind me what your second question was was more of a going to sort of?,,,
1100,0.7456566691398621,6211.2,6218.9," How much of those resources, the whole team has access to, but if that'll be addressed later, we can we can bookmark that for now.",,,
1101,0.7456566691398621,6219.1,6224.3,And then for now I was mostly just concerned about the making sure we had a baseline of definitions.,,,
1102,0.7456566691398621,6224.5,6226.6,So I you answered that question.,,,
1103,0.7456566691398621,6226.6,6228.2,So I think we can move forward.,,,
1104,0.7456566691398621,6228.3,6228.9,Terrific.,,,
1105,0.7456566691398621,6228.9,6229.8,Thank you very much.,,,
1106,0.7456566691398621,6231.1,6240.4,"So we are going to transition and your and your question is extremely well timed, because we are going to transition over to the",,,
1107,0.630872368812561,6241.0,6242.5, Tation by.,,,
1108,0.8832314014434814,6244.2,6248.3," Sorry, well, your test actually or rather.",,,
1109,0.8832314014434814,6248.3,6251.8,"Sorry, deputy director Colby before we move on.",,,
1110,0.8832314014434814,6253.5,6257.2,We actually noted this in the agenda as an additional agenda item.,,,
1111,0.8832314014434814,6257.2,6259.9,So I want to make sure that we read it into the record.,,,
1112,0.8832314014434814,6259.9,6265.9,"But before we do that, I think I want to take the opportunity of the presentation break to open up to Hope.",,,
1113,0.8832314014434814,6265.9,6267.9,Team related questions.,,,
1114,0.8832314014434814,6269.4,6273.9,And I know that councilmember Morales has some I have some,,,
1115,0.7107959389686584,6274.6,6276.8, And I promise councilmember out she'd go for.,,,
1116,0.7107959389686584,6276.8,6279.3,So I'm going to turn over to her to get it started.,,,
1117,0.7107959389686584,6279.3,6285.1,And then if anyone else wants to raise your hand and I'll put you in the queue again for Hope.,,,
1118,0.7107959389686584,6285.1,6286.5,Team related questions.,,,
1119,0.8362177014350891,6288.5,6289.0, Thank you.,,,
1120,0.8362177014350891,6289.4,6292.5,I do have a lot of questions about about the Hope program.,,,
1121,0.8362177014350891,6292.5,6293.3,So thank you.,,,
1122,0.8362177014350891,6293.5,6305.9,I want to start by first giving a huge shout out again to my staff member Devin Silvernail who's been really instrumental in supporting the street sinks and the Hope program work.,,,
1123,0.8362177014350891,6307.8,6317.6,"And I do want to start by addressing the public commenters who called in today to demand that the city council, stop the sweeps.",,,
1124,0.9128387570381165,6318.2,6321.2," First, I want to thank you for engaging with City Hall.",,,
1125,0.9128387570381165,6321.2,6336.3,Your advocacy is very important and I hope and I'm sure that all of that will continue and I want to make it really clear that city council has done everything we can to stop and kamut removals.,,,
1126,0.9128387570381165,6337.2,6344.1,"And I want to say to the commenters directly your anger is righteous, but it needs to be directed to the mayor.",,,
1127,0.9128387570381165,6344.7,6347.0,We can fund new programs as a council.,,,
1128,0.9128387570381165,6347.0,6347.8,We can fund new.,,,
1129,0.9128384590148926,6348.0,6359.1," Shelter, we can fight to limit or stop the sweeps, but at the end of the day, we can't force the mayor or the Department's to follow what we've asked for.",,,
1130,0.9128384590148926,6359.8,6376.4,"And so I know this council is extraordinarily frustrated, that the things we've been trying to do, get stymied my staff and my colleagues have spent months bringing service providers to the table to get the navigation team changed into something.",,,
1131,0.9128384590148926,6376.4,6377.5,That is more humane.,,,
1132,0.9128386378288269,6377.9,6380.7, To fund something that was supposed to be different.,,,
1133,0.9128386378288269,6380.8,6384.6,The Hope program only to hear that the same program.,,,
1134,0.9128386378288269,6384.7,6392.1,"Same problems are persisting and even though, you know, apparently those problems are now spread across several departments.",,,
1135,0.9128386378288269,6392.1,6398.1,"This is really a testament to, to the power that the executive has.",,,
1136,0.9128386378288269,6398.2,6404.4,"And how little regard, this particular executive has for our unhoused neighbors and for a provider communities.",,,
1137,0.9128386378288269,6404.7,6407.8,I know we have lots of questions about how they are being treated.,,,
1138,0.8920499086380005,6408.0,6409.5, And we'll get to those in a minute.,,,
1139,0.8920499086380005,6410.7,6413.9,"But I do want to say, to colleagues in the executive branch.",,,
1140,0.8920499086380005,6414.0,6422.4,I think this Council has been very clear during the summer and fall that we wanted encampment removals to be an absolute Last Resort.,,,
1141,0.8920499086380005,6422.8,6425.3,We've heard from several members of the public today.,,,
1142,0.8920499086380005,6425.5,6428.1,Some of whom are Outreach providers themselves.,,,
1143,0.8920499086380005,6428.4,6432.0,That sweeps are ramping back up and we've had just ate in this week.,,,
1144,0.8920499086380005,6432.9,6437.7,Public Cola reported yesterday that non-congregate options that we are.,,,
1145,0.8506004810333252,6437.9,6440.5, Our that those are almost at capacity.,,,
1146,0.8506004810333252,6441.8,6449.9,"They specifically cited Lehigh director, Sharon Lee, who said that of the 139 spaces at the executive Pacific Hotel?",,,
1147,0.8506004810333252,6449.9,6452.2,109 are full.,,,
1148,0.8506004810333252,6452.9,6456.0,So we are still in a pandemic.,,,
1149,0.8506004810333252,6456.3,6467.8,"The CDC is still recommending non-congregate options, and we need to understand better why we are even considering encampment removals when people have",,,
1150,0.9128387570381165,6467.9,6468.8, Place to go.,,,
1151,0.9128387570381165,6469.3,6497.7,"We worked really hard as a council to fund, tiny homes, hotel rooms, and other forms of non-congregate shelter, and we've frankly met resistance at every turn and it seems to me that that is what needs to be a priority getting those shelter units and hotel and housing units available before we even think about asking, unhoused people to trust us in getting them into services and shelter, need to build trust again with providers and with unhoused people.",,,
1152,0.9128386378288269,6497.9,6499.0, All to get them help.,,,
1153,0.9128386378288269,6499.2,6501.2,Not to be pushing people around the city.,,,
1154,0.9128386378288269,6502.1,6506.1,So thank you for indulging me.,,,
1155,0.9128386378288269,6506.1,6514.1,I feel like all of that really had to be said and I know I'm not the only council member who feels that way and I'm certainly not the only Community member who feels that way.,,,
1156,0.9128386378288269,6514.5,6519.6,So I do have some very basic questions up front and I will have a few more questions later.,,,
1157,0.9128386378288269,6520.2,6521.8,I'd like to ask first.,,,
1158,0.8137072920799255,6522.7,6528.3, Whoo-hoo directly engages with encampment residents and who doesn't?,,,
1159,0.8137072920799255,6528.9,6531.4,"And what, what does that engagement look like?",,,
1160,0.8137072920799255,6531.4,6533.9,So I'd like to understand better.,,,
1161,0.8137072920799255,6533.9,6536.3,What kind of on-site support is provided.,,,
1162,0.8137072920799255,6536.3,6544.2,"For example, what kind of Transportation support, what does that mean when somebody is engaging and providing that kind of assistance?",,,
1163,0.9128382802009583,6546.7,6550.3, I'm happy to start the answer to that question.,,,
1164,0.9128382802009583,6551.1,6555.7,So who engages with people in encampments on the site?,,,
1165,0.9128382802009583,6555.8,6557.4,Our Outreach providers.,,,
1166,0.9128382802009583,6557.7,6567.4,"So Outreach providers, work directly with folks that are experiencing homelessness on sites and industries.",,,
1167,0.9128382802009583,6568.5,6575.1,The Hope team provides support at the request of our Outreach providers.,,,
1168,0.9025906324386597,6576.2,6578.4, In helping them to do their work.,,,
1169,0.9025906324386597,6579.1,6584.6,"So, some of that support can include helping with real-time shelter referrals.",,,
1170,0.9025906324386597,6585.2,6598.5,It can include helping to make Transportation arrangements for folks that are unsheltered and in encampments and sometimes connecting the Outreach providers with translation services.,,,
1171,0.9025906324386597,6599.0,6603.4,"So simple answer, I think to your very important question.",,,
1172,0.9127709269523621,6605.7,6610.3," So in the budget, we had eight positions that were funded.",,,
1173,0.9127709269523621,6610.3,6612.8,Can you talk about what responsibilities?,,,
1174,0.9127709269523621,6612.8,6616.0,Each of the different roles in the Hope program.,,,
1175,0.9127709269523621,6616.8,6617.6,You thank you.,,,
1176,0.9127709269523621,6617.8,6623.5,We actually received that question from your central staff and have provided that information back to them.,,,
1177,0.9127709269523621,6623.9,6631.7,I can say generally what who we have in the Hope team are what we folks that are system.,,,
1178,0.9127709269523621,6631.7,6634.2,Navigators Tara obviously.,,,
1179,0.9050637483596802,6634.4,6639.2," Data, some folks that are working on data, but I'd be happy to walk.",,,
1180,0.9050637483596802,6639.2,6643.6,You through that longer list and more detailed list that we've provided to Central staff.,,,
1181,0.7218297719955444,6646.1,6651.1," I, I can get that list from them, and we'll share that with my colleagues.",,,
1182,0.7218297719955444,6651.6,6652.2,There.,,,
1183,0.7218297719955444,6652.2,6658.5,"I have lots of questions, but maybe I'll just get to the second second one, and then, and then be quiet for a minute.",,,
1184,0.7218297719955444,6659.0,6662.8,The only other person in the queue currently is council member Petersen.,,,
1185,0.7218297719955444,6662.8,6668.9,So maybe if you want to do one more question and then we could true Alex for a few and then go back to you.,,,
1186,0.7218297719955444,6669.2,6669.9,Thank you.,,,
1187,0.7218297719955444,6670.4,6675.4,So it's my understanding that referrals are arranged with providers through a group.,,,
1188,0.8455669283866882,6675.6,6698.6," Text based system that has a limited number of slots and that there may be more Outreach workers than there are slots available during the budget Council, expressed support for the city to act as a facilitator for referrals, by providing direct access to the tools that the Hope team can use you.",,,
1189,0.8455669283866882,6698.6,6705.4,Tell me if that's been considered and can you tell me any other work that's been done to kind of cut down the,,,
1190,0.8730805516242981,6705.6,6709.7, Barriers for outreach providers to work more directly with shelter providers.,,,
1191,0.8730805516242981,6711.0,6711.5,Thank you.,,,
1192,0.8730805516242981,6711.7,6717.4,The world that hold the plays in shelter referrals is a really critical one.,,,
1193,0.8730805516242981,6717.6,6723.0,"I mean, as we all know that there is scarce availability of vacancies in shelters.",,,
1194,0.8730805516242981,6723.0,6727.3,"It's a very scarce, very precious resource and buy filters.",,,
1195,0.8730805516242981,6727.3,6733.2,I'm including Hotel based shelters as well as as well as Villages.,,,
1196,0.8730805516242981,6734.0,6735.5,So we have,,,
1197,0.8577683568000793,6735.8,6743.4," As you noted, multiple agencies in the field, all working with different clients all competing for those same scarce resources.",,,
1198,0.8577683568000793,6743.8,6763.2,"So one agency has to manage those recommendations in order to ensure that the the clients that are Outreach provider partners are working with are matched, appropriately to the shelter's based on Acuity of need and show and services provider in the shelters.",,,
1199,0.8577683568000793,6763.4,6765.4,And that really is a key function.,,,
1200,0.73011714220047,6765.5,6767.7, Function of the team.,,,
1201,0.73011714220047,6767.7,6768.5,The excuse me.,,,
1202,0.73011714220047,6768.5,6773.3,The Hope team is really to address that sort of equity of access if you will.,,,
1203,0.8586053252220154,6776.5,6784.7," If I might add, also, the challenges with the existing text thread for shelter recommendations has been well known.",,,
1204,0.8586053252220154,6784.7,6788.5,And that's something that the Hope team has worked with providers on.,,,
1205,0.8586053252220154,6788.5,6794.7,We meet with them weekly and have other meetings as well with director-level staff.,,,
1206,0.8586053252220154,6794.7,6796.5,As well as direct service staff.,,,
1207,0.8586053252220154,6796.7,6806.0,We are currently looking at three different options to replace the text thread and are getting ready to finalize those decisions.,,,
1208,0.8586053252220154,6806.0,6806.2,The,,,
1209,0.9128385186195374,6806.3,6814.4, Indications of which tools to use to replace that have been given to us in partnership with by Outreach providers to us.,,,
1210,0.9128385186195374,6814.4,6827.1,And so we're working with our data analyst on which of those will probably be the best in terms of protecting information of the clients that shared and give us the best access for providers.,,,
1211,0.9128385186195374,6827.6,6833.4,So we can follow up with you on the decision that's made and how that rolls out in coming weeks.,,,
1212,0.906432032585144,6839.6,6844.6," All right, with, with that, let's go to counseling or Peterson for for his question.",,,
1213,0.906432032585144,6844.6,6848.5,"And then councilmember Alex, if you still have questions, we'll certainly pivot back to you.",,,
1214,0.906432032585144,6849.5,6850.3,Councilman Peterson.,,,
1215,0.906432032585144,6850.8,6852.0,"Thank you, chair lewisite.",,,
1216,0.906432032585144,6852.1,6864.1,I know everyone's eager for the most effective solutions to bring people inside and end the suffering on our streets and in our parks and it's okay to disagree in areas of policy.,,,
1217,0.906432032585144,6864.1,6869.2,I just want to implore my colleagues just strive to treat our city government colleagues with,,,
1218,0.773661732673645,6869.4,6870.0, Respect.,,,
1219,0.773661732673645,6870.0,6872.8,And to not question their intentions.,,,
1220,0.773661732673645,6872.8,6882.8,I feel that people are working hard in a difficult environment during a pandemic and we want to encourage them to do their best.,,,
1221,0.773661732673645,6882.8,6888.4,And I want to thank our human services department for being here and the nonprofits in the field for the work.,,,
1222,0.773661732673645,6888.4,6890.6,They're doing to get positive results.,,,
1223,0.773661732673645,6891.2,6894.3,"And it also will, when we refer to the city council.",,,
1224,0.773661732673645,6894.9,6897.4,It doesn't always include 9 all night of us.,,,
1225,0.773661732673645,6898.0,6899.2,Sometimes it's I'm a,,,
1226,0.8272557854652405,6899.3,6911.5," Majority, but not necessarily all of us and there are disagreements in policy, and I'm hoping we get the best results here, and I just want to take it to temperature down and treat our colleagues with respect here.",,,
1227,0.8272557854652405,6911.6,6912.1,Thank you.,,,
1228,0.644454836845398,6916.4,6918.5, Councilmember Mesquita.,,,
1229,0.644454836845398,6918.5,6919.3,Do you have a question?,,,
1230,0.8710234761238098,6923.1,6923.7, Thank you very much.,,,
1231,0.8710234761238098,6923.7,6924.5,Mr. Chair.,,,
1232,0.8710234761238098,6924.5,6936.3,"I wanted to emphasize that I really support councilmember Morales is line of questioning and I will be deferring to councilmember Morales for her future questions as well, because they are very much in line with the questions that I had.",,,
1233,0.8710234761238098,6936.5,6939.8,"In addition to her opening comments, which I found were respectful.",,,
1234,0.8710234761238098,6939.8,6952.5,"I found very much appropriate for the situation that we're in a year into a pandemic where the CDC has continued to say that we should not be sweeping people, if we do not have alternative non-congregate shelter.",,,
1235,0.8449260592460632,6952.7,6953.7, Options available.,,,
1236,0.8449260592460632,6954.1,6956.8,We have a sense of urgency to address this.,,,
1237,0.8449260592460632,6957.0,6961.9,I found the comments also be Illuminating for members who are present here today.,,,
1238,0.8449260592460632,6961.9,6966.2,And also hopefully members of the public about the important roles as well.,,,
1239,0.8449260592460632,6966.2,6976.7,The legislative and executive branches have to addressing these crises and in an effort to make sure that we are being transparent about what the legislative branch has funded.,,,
1240,0.8449260592460632,6976.7,6978.1,And what our expectations are.,,,
1241,0.8449260592460632,6978.3,6982.5,I believe the council member Morales is line of questioning is are absolutely right.,,,
1242,0.8803722858428955,6982.6,6989.5, Speckle in order and very much needed for setting the context to why this hearing is so important.,,,
1243,0.8803722858428955,6989.5,6989.9,Mr. Chair.,,,
1244,0.8803722858428955,6989.9,6994.1,I appreciate your time and setting up this meeting today and the presenters as well.,,,
1245,0.8803722858428955,6994.1,6999.3,But I think that all of us are here to get to those Solutions and asking this point of questions is part of that.,,,
1246,0.8803722858428955,6999.5,7000.7,Thank you very much councilmembers.,,,
1247,0.8803722858428955,7000.7,7004.3,And I'll again defer my time and questions do come from a Morales.,,,
1248,0.8803722858428955,7005.3,7009.1,Thank you councilmember Swan you're recognized.,,,
1249,0.7217143774032593,7014.9,7016.4, Thank you gossamer.,,,
1250,0.7217143774032593,7016.4,7016.6,Louis.,,,
1251,0.7217143774032593,7016.6,7020.6,"Sorry, I'm not able to turn my camera on because of my connection.",,,
1252,0.7217143774032593,7022.5,7023.5,Just one second.,,,
1253,0.8957357406616211,7027.8,7035.8, I really appreciate council members speaking in opposition to the sweeps of homeless Community.,,,
1254,0.8957357406616211,7035.8,7049.7,"Encampments, we know and as people in public comment today and before have said, the sweeps don't actually help people in any way.",,,
1255,0.8957357406616211,7049.7,7055.7,"In fact, they cause additional problems and I think a lot of the people have color.",,,
1256,0.8957357406616211,7055.7,7056.8,I said correctly that,,,
1257,0.8044738173484802,7057.2,7082.3," Actually, not only does it increase the demoralisation and the trauma and the sense of desperation and isolation as a homeless Community person, when you go, when you are subjected to a sweeper, also materially you end up losing your belongings, your resources and they have been proven over and over again, to be completely inhumane and ineffective.",,,
1258,0.8044738173484802,7082.5,7087.0,"And, you know, we've seen these issues intensify actually during the pandemic.",,,
1259,0.7227209210395813,7087.1,7108.1," You know, when the when the calendars and park when calendars, for some Park was swept, most of the community members had nowhere to go and then they move to the new Miller Park for example, and we've seen the kind of support that actually are homeless community members have had from our house community members and how outraged housed community members are working.",,,
1260,0.7227209210395813,7108.1,7117.0,People are about the fact that the homeless community members are not even getting access to tiny houses and I,,,
1261,0.8191262483596802,7117.2,7122.5," This point is going to come up in the next agenda item, but I just started sort of belong here as well.",,,
1262,0.8191262483596802,7122.5,7139.4,So I'm just going to go ahead and make some of the points here that I would have made later is I don't see how the mayor can justify not yet spending the actually using the funding that our people's budget movement.,,,
1263,0.8191262483596802,7139.4,7147.0,One last remember for new tiny house Villages and this was many organizations that really fought for.,,,
1264,0.7361499667167664,7147.1,7151.0," By this, you know, real change Nichols will share real socialist alternative.",,,
1265,0.7361499667167664,7151.3,7155.3,"You know, many of the organizations that were involved in the Amazon tax struggle.",,,
1266,0.7361499667167664,7155.3,7164.9,"Many, many of them were also involved in fighting for and winning funding for new tiny house Villages and it's extremely.",,,
1267,0.7361499667167664,7165.9,7167.4,"It's extremely troubling, not.",,,
1268,0.7361499667167664,7167.6,7169.9,"No, I'm not surprised in any way, which is extremely troubling.",,,
1269,0.7361499667167664,7169.9,7172.4,Troubling to hear as community members are pointing out.,,,
1270,0.7361499667167664,7172.5,7177.0,Likely that many sweeps are scheduled for May of the month of May for this.,,,
1271,0.8873880505561829,7177.2,7182.2, And this is the exact opposite of how the mayor should be using public resources.,,,
1272,0.8873880505561829,7182.2,7187.8,"These I mean, these are not her personal resources that our public resources and the public has spoken loud and clear.",,,
1273,0.8873880505561829,7188.6,7194.8,And so I do I do believe a lot of this responsibility lies at the doorstep of the mayor's office.,,,
1274,0.8873880505561829,7195.2,7206.3,"I don't agree, though, that the city council is all on the same page and that has that all council members have done, everything that it can be that can be done to stop the sweet for me just to give you a concrete example.",,,

1281,0.8999889492988586,7258.8,7260.0,And I thank them for that.,,,
1282,0.8999889492988586,7260.6,7261.3,"But you know, what?",,,
1283,0.8999889492988586,7261.3,7262.8,We're going to see it later in.,,,
1284,0.8999889492988586,7262.8,7266.9,The presentation is that there are two new brother.,,,

1287,0.790302574634552,7281.3,7284.2,And while it's positive that it's being expanded.,,,

1289,0.790302574634552,7286.4,7288.5,"I mean, that's, it's not, that's not accurate.",,,

1294,0.8298683762550354,7302.6,7304.9,Why is it only being issued now?,,,
1295,0.8298683762550354,7304.9,7315.4,"And also, I would point out that an RFP is not even should not be needed because of former mayor Marie's, declared state of civil emergency is still in effect.",,,
1296,0.8298683762550354,7315.4,7326.9,"As far as I know, and it gives the mayor the authority to find homeless Services Parts, re-find homeless Services immediately without an RFP but over but regardless of whether an RFP is a shooter.",,,
1297,0.7195493578910828,7327.0,7339.3, Not my general point is that it's simply not acceptable for a third of a year to have gone by with people suffering in our streets sidewalks and Parks without these tiny house villagers being established.,,,
1298,0.7195493578910828,7339.3,7356.2,And I know that staff will the HST staff will talk about CPA review and so on and so forth and we should obviously make note of that but it is I don't I don't believe that all those technical,,,

1302,0.8200077414512634,7377.9,7382.2,"And I once again, I wanted to thank all the community members who have really spoken.",,,
1303,0.8200077414512634,7382.2,7385.8,So clearly against these inhumane and ineffective sweeps.,,,

1309,0.8207383155822754,7405.0,7407.0,"I have a question about the Hope, team itself.",,,
1310,0.8207383155822754,7407.0,7411.0,And then I have a couple questions about the providers and the Contracting that's happening.,,,
1311,0.8207383155822754,7411.0,7416.7,"So the you know, as you begin this presentation",,,
1312,0.9107154011726379,7417.5,7421.3," You mentioned that high priority, sites are determined by departments.",,,
1313,0.9107154011726379,7422.2,7429.1,And we have heard from providers that there is this sort of infrastructure based system to prioritize.,,,
1314,0.9107154011726379,7430.9,7446.7,"And so I'm interested in, you know, how this approach of prioritization differs from what the navigation team was doing and just trying to understand how providers are integrated into the process of determining areas or populations.",,,
1315,0.7487711906433105,7446.9,7457.4," Is that need engagement if the focus really is not on people but on Parks and you know, whatever, whatever the Departments are determining should be the priorities instead.",,,
1316,0.9100208282470703,7459.3,7459.6, Great.,,,
1317,0.9100208282470703,7459.6,7459.9,Sorry.,,,
1318,0.9100208282470703,7459.9,7461.5,Just taking a couple notes Here.,,,

1320,0.8376044034957886,7466.4,7473.9,"So first I just want to go back to a comment that I made earlier, which is as you noted councilmember Morales.",,,
1321,0.8376044034957886,7473.9,7484.6,The HST is no longer determining location where encampments need to be addressed or removed that lies firmly.,,,
1322,0.8376044034957886,7484.6,7494.5,"Now with the Departments that owned the property or have responsibility for those public spaces, the general Pryor, the general criteria that they",,,
1323,0.872011125087738,7494.7,7522.9," Use in determining what their high priority sites are have to do with safety hazardous situations, to either individuals who are outside and encampments and or two other members of the of the public, for example, in construction sites, blockages such as Ada, blockages, as well as ensuring access to public spaces for all of our community members.",,,
1324,0.9014905095100403,7523.5,7538.9," So, you asked about the role that Outreach providers play in either determining these sites, or in supporting people that are living in encampments.",,,
1325,0.9014905095100403,7538.9,7539.9,In priority sites.,,,
1326,0.9014905095100403,7539.9,7547.7,There are Our Hope team meets with providers on a weekly basis.,,,
1327,0.9014905095100403,7547.7,7553.4,"They meet to be able to talk through issues that have Arisen, but they",,,
1328,0.844990074634552,7553.6,7566.8, Also needs to talk about scheduling Outreach for high priority areas to ensure that they have an opportunity to be on site and to work with folks in encampments.,,,
1329,0.844990074634552,7566.8,7571.3,On the in those priority sites to to work with them around service needs and shelter.,,,
1330,0.844990074634552,7571.3,7578.3,Needs Outreach does inform the that engagement timeline.,,,
1331,0.844990074634552,7578.3,7582.9,So that is a really important role that they play and in terms of,,,
1332,0.887618362903595,7583.5,7594.6, Ation and processes part of the reason that we have those weekly meetings is so that we can continue to improve the process that we have working with them.,,,

1336,0.7229585647583008,7607.7,7632.7,So we have heard from service providers about that since January their city-funded Outreach have these folks have been working in good faith on their hsd contracts with the presumption that there would possibly be some minor changes to their contracts that when the contracts were disseminated in the spring.,,,
1337,0.8741393089294434,7633.3,7643.2," Providers were surprised to find some really dramatic changes to, their required delivery Care Systems, to my knowledge, reach the Seattle, Indian Health Board.",,,

1339,0.8741393089294434,7654.3,7658.0,"So, can you tell me how it just depends on reimbursing?",,,

1341,0.8741393089294434,7660.1,7663.0,"They've already provided in the first quarter, if they decide.",,,

1346,0.7710404396057129,7674.1,7679.5,"So, I'd like to start with your question about what that process of contract.",,,
1347,0.7710404396057129,7679.5,7686.4,"Negotiations has looked like, as you know, this is a brand new model for hsd.",,,
1348,0.7710404396057129,7686.7,7693.1,We are still doing a lot of learning about what it means to have shift into this new role of,,,

1350,0.8461334109306335,7698.1,7717.9,"We also are cognizant that we have an obligation, both to the council, and to the public, to be able to report out on the activities, but most importantly, on the outcomes of this work that we are asking our Outreach providers to do so much of the work we've been doing during this contract.",,,
1351,0.8461334109306335,7717.9,7719.9,Negotiation has been around data.,,,
1352,0.8461334109306335,7721.0,7723.0,We absolutely know that,,,
1353,0.9121883511543274,7723.5,7726.4, data is hard to collect.,,,
1354,0.9121883511543274,7726.8,7728.8,We know that it is complex.,,,
1355,0.9121883511543274,7729.4,7747.0,"We have experience in collecting that data know just how hard it is, which is why we are collaborating with our Outreach Partners working together on it so that we can provide the information to you to the mayor to public to media, that everybody expects from the program.",,,
1356,0.9121883511543274,7748.1,7749.8,In terms of reimbursement.,,,

1360,0.9128383994102478,7760.2,7772.7," Okay, and my last question, so we continue to focus with these contracts on Outreach to unhoused individuals, and that is certainly important.",,,
1361,0.9128383994102478,7772.8,7776.1,But we know that service providers and,,,
1362,0.9055742025375366,7777.9,7784.5," Everybody seems to understand that the, the way we're really going to solve this problem is to make sure that there's housing available.",,,
1363,0.9055742025375366,7785.0,7800.1,"So will the proposed changes that are being considered fixed the service providers access to housing referrals, including shelters, like the executive in and tiny houses that are managed by the navigation Center.",,,
1364,0.9128382802009583,7801.3,7812.0," And will the city be putting any energy into long-term permanent housing options, so that we can actually find places for folks to go and stop doing the front end.",,,

1366,0.9128382802009583,7813.2,7818.4,Stop putting so much energy on that without putting more energy into the actual solution here.,,,
1367,0.9128382802009583,7820.1,7820.5,Yeah.,,,
1368,0.9128382802009583,7821.6,7823.2,Thank you so much for that question.,,,

1370,0.9128382802009583,7827.7,7830.5,And so I will go ahead and answer that.,,,
1371,0.8672854900360107,7830.7,7833.5," Question, first, absolutely.",,,
1372,0.8672854900360107,7833.5,7853.8,"We are continuing to invest in permanent housing, both through permanent Supportive Housing, through affordable housing for folks, at the very lowest income levels as well, as I described earlier, through Rapid rehousing program, that is attached to our hotel based shelters to help people exit to how to permanent housing.",,,

1374,0.8672854900360107,7855.3,7860.3,Housing is what ends homelessness your question about the referral process.,,,

1376,0.9128382205963135,7871.5,7876.7,This is a testament to our ability to highly utilize our shelter system.,,,
1377,0.9128382205963135,7877.3,7882.8,And again with so many Outreach providers in the in the community working.,,,

1379,0.9128382205963135,7886.5,7889.9,We feel strongly that there needs to be a central point.,,,
1380,0.7936467528343201,7890.7,7901.9," Of actual Act of the final referral into the shelters to make sure that there is as I described earlier, and equitable distribution of that resource.",,,
1381,0.7936467528343201,7902.7,7920.3,"I will say that one of the questions that came up during the public, testimony was around needing data to identify questions, around racial Equity, social justice related to the work that the Hope team is coordinating.",,,
1382,0.7936467528343201,7920.3,7920.5,And,,,
1383,0.893621027469635,7920.6,7924.5, the Outreach teams are implementing and we couldn't agree more.,,,
1384,0.893621027469635,7924.7,7943.8,So this is a great example of why we do need data from the field from the folks who are engaging directly with people that are in crisis so that we actually can report back on what the equity outcomes are of the work that we're coordinating and participating in.,,,
1385,0.9128382802009583,7948.1,7948.7, Thank you.,,,

1402,0.8819290399551392,7998.0,8004.7,I have inquired about that but to my knowledge and I actually spent some time going through my emails to see if I had a rose.,,,

1410,0.9128385782241821,8035.0,8035.3, As well.,,,
1411,0.9128385782241821,8035.3,8036.4,"Jeff, my bad.",,,
1412,0.8455198407173157,8039.0,8043.8," Yeah, and Jeff II did actually get that information this morning, I think.",,,
1413,0.8455198407173157,8044.6,8047.1,So I can forward that along as well.,,,
1414,0.8219848275184631,8050.2,8050.6, Okay.,,,
1415,0.8219848275184631,8050.6,8056.6,"Well, I have a few additional questions that I want to ask what we're still on this bit.",,,
1416,0.8219848275184631,8056.6,8057.3,Just relates.,,,
1417,0.8219848275184631,8057.3,8077.8,"I, you know, I understand that the whole team does not necessarily post the removals that happens with the you know, the department that is managing the particular area where there is an encampment but I wanted to ask is my understanding is the other day, the Hope team.",,,
1418,0.8822761178016663,8078.7,8086.9, Worked with just care in doing Outreach around the Perla and Pioneer Square.,,,
1419,0.8822761178016663,8088.0,8108.4,"And I just wanted to ask about that engagement because there was no removal posted the Outreach workers, you know, engaged, you know, centering engaging with the folks that are living their people were offered, you know, resources.",,,
1420,0.9128382205963135,8109.3,8114.8, Housing and an access to that kind of a placement in the Peugeot is clear.,,,
1421,0.9128382205963135,8114.8,8124.2,"Now because people were offered a place to go they left, there was no need to do a posting and and everything that goes along with a posting.",,,
1422,0.9128382205963135,8125.2,8133.6,So I guess I just wanted to ask a general broad question based on the success of that collaboration between the Hope team and just care.,,,
1423,0.8468433022499084,8136.4,8146.6, Potentially exploring how going forward we could use that alternative form instead of using a post and then remove model.,,,
1424,0.8468433022499084,8147.4,8162.2,"Instead having a well resource engagement model that the results and people getting where they need to go results in the, in this case, the pergola being cleared of folks that were camping there and just maybe expanding on.",,,
1425,0.9128385186195374,8163.3,8171.4, If there's scope for more cooperation like that between Just Karen The Hope team going forward because the I was pleased to hear that there was some coordination there.,,,
1426,0.9128385186195374,8171.5,8178.2,And just wonder if someone could jump on that and maybe expand a little bit Tara Lewis.,,,
1427,0.9128385186195374,8178.2,8191.4,I can give you a general statement that the Hope team has worked with just care and a number of occasions where they've engaged folks that are in encampments.,,,
1428,0.9128385186195374,8191.8,8192.9,I can,,,
1429,0.746080219745636,8193.2,8193.4, To you.,,,
1430,0.746080219745636,8193.4,8204.6,I do not know the specifics of this the collaboration that you're describing and I will work with Tara and her team to get back to you with more information on that.,,,
1431,0.8249214291572571,8207.3,8208.4," Okay, appreciate it.",,,
1432,0.8249214291572571,8208.6,8220.9,It just seems like it offers a good precedent because I have heard concerns particularly from a lot of property owners in Pioneer Square of a perception.,,,
1433,0.8249214291572571,8221.1,8221.5,Right?,,,
1434,0.8249214291572571,8221.5,8233.1,"Because I, you know, I mean we talked a lot about the impact that a lot of these removal operations have in the place where, you know, on the folks that are actually living there.",,,
1435,0.8249214291572571,8233.2,8236.7,"Right, but I have also started getting complaints for the",,,
1436,0.8648913502693176,8237.1,8250.0, I'm as well from property owners and managers that removals and other parts of the city are leading to people being displaced into the center of the city.,,,
1437,0.8648913502693176,8251.0,8256.2,"And, you know, I'm not raising that to highlight, you know, they're need above the people that are living there.",,,
1438,0.8648913502693176,8256.2,8256.5,I guess.,,,
1439,0.8648913502693176,8256.5,8266.2,"I'm just highlighting that as a new concern that I'm hearing that of in the cases when there are folks that are displaced from removals, you know, they're going somewhere.",,,
1440,0.8648913502693176,8266.3,8266.9,Those people are,,,
1441,0.8991163372993469,8267.0,8267.8, Just disappearing.,,,
1442,0.8991163372993469,8267.8,8296.2,"And so I wonder is there anywhere in how the Hope team operates currently or in the future of tracking and planning for displacement from posted removals, or at least assessing the impact of the displacement, not just on the impact to the individuals, but the anticipated impact to other neighbors, and the, and the broader Community as well.",,,
1443,0.8991163372993469,8296.2,8296.9,Because,,,
1444,0.8987031579017639,8297.0,8299.5, Seems to be a matter of growing concern.,,,
1445,0.8987031579017639,8299.5,8308.1,"When I talk to community members business owners, as well as people who are service providers and Advocates and mutual Aid workers.",,,
1446,0.8987031579017639,8308.1,8316.2,"That is a terrific example of the kind of analysis of data that we really want to do, which is why we are engaging.",,,
1447,0.8987031579017639,8316.2,8326.9,"So closely with our Outreach Partners, who are in the field, who are working with folks who are experiencing homelessness to gather sufficient data so that we can begin to.",,,
1448,0.806455671787262,8327.0,8329.7, To do that kind of nuanced analysis.,,,
1449,0.806455671787262,8329.7,8331.5,So I'm so glad you brought that up.,,,
1450,0.8098185062408447,8334.4,8334.6, All right.,,,
1451,0.8098185062408447,8334.6,8338.7,"Well, you can definitely expect my office to follow up on that because",,,
1452,0.6606223583221436,8340.9,8342.1," you know, I did it.",,,
1453,0.6606223583221436,8343.1,8345.5,I think we might as well just leave it at that for now.,,,
1454,0.6606223583221436,8346.1,8350.0,"But you know, it's also not a new Assad new issue.",,,
1455,0.6606223583221436,8350.0,8354.3,"So going forward, definitely expect.",,,
1456,0.8618111610412598,8357.1,8359.9, That it's something that we're going to this committee is going to want to address.,,,
1457,0.8618111610412598,8360.6,8365.7,So with that I think unless there's any final questions from folks.,,,
1458,0.88969886302948,8366.8,8367.8, Councilmember scada.,,,
1459,0.88969886302948,8368.5,8368.9,Thank you.,,,
1460,0.88969886302948,8368.9,8369.8,Mr. Chair.,,,
1461,0.88969886302948,8370.3,8370.9,I'm soaking.,,,
1462,0.7879486680030823,8380.0,8380.5, I want it.,,,
1463,0.7879486680030823,8380.5,8382.7,I actually want to extrapolate a little bit more on that question.,,,
1464,0.7879486680030823,8382.7,8392.1,You just asked because it's not like we need data to prove that when you post a sign of removal people move throughout the city.,,,
1465,0.7879486680030823,8392.1,8393.1,That is part of the reason.,,,
1466,0.7879486680030823,8393.1,8398.1,"The CDC guidance says, don't put those signs up during a pandemic.",,,
1467,0.7879486680030823,8398.1,8404.9,"So I want to ask three specific questions that have in some ways been asked already, but to try to hear a little bit more of a finite time.",,,
1468,0.8553285002708435,8405.1,8408.6," Mine, will you not?",,,
1469,0.8553285002708435,8408.9,8409.7,Hope will?,,,
1470,0.8553285002708435,8409.7,8430.5,"So we've heard from Outreach workers, but they have sufficiently engaged with everyone there on places to move people to because the initial removals that we heard about many of the provider organizations have said, if we just had a little bit more time, we could have actually bought everybody into the housing and there's a bottleneck of getting folks into those available rooms.",,,
1471,0.8553285002708435,8430.5,8434.9,"Now, we needed more time, post went up and cause people to scatter, so",,,
1472,0.7961957454681396,8435.0,8437.0," Number one, we need more time.",,,
1473,0.7961957454681396,8437.8,8440.0,"And ideally, not even having those posts blow up.",,,
1474,0.7961957454681396,8440.0,8444.6,"As I think councilmember Lewis's policy, directive was leaning towards",,,
1475,0.769780695438385,8449.0,8460.9," Between when a single dad and when a verbal update, so that people are understanding among the Community Partners because it's definitely not enough time.",,,
1476,0.769780695438385,8460.9,8461.4,But what?,,,
1477,0.8818303942680359,8467.2,8470.9, And I apologize councilmember most Kata you cut in and out.,,,
1478,0.8818303942680359,8471.4,8473.2,Shall I answer that first question.,,,
1479,0.8818303942680359,8473.5,8475.2,I'm going to go ahead and do it.,,,
1480,0.8818303942680359,8476.5,8487.3,"So just as a kind of a quick reminder, we don't do the posting and we don't again don't identify which are the sites that need to be posted.",,,
1481,0.8818303942680359,8487.8,8494.8,"We do however, work very closely with the Outreach providers on scheduling Outreach.",,,
1482,0.8818303942680359,8495.3,8495.4,I,,,
1483,0.912838339805603,8496.0,8511.6, Maybe an example of this would be helpful and I'd like to ask Tara if she might be able to give a little bit of an example from Miller Park in terms of how that engagement in advance of what was ultimately removal worked.,,,
1484,0.7415744662284851,8513.1,8513.7, Thank you.,,,
1485,0.7415744662284851,8513.7,8516.9,"Yeah, Miller Park was a really good success.",,,
1486,0.7415744662284851,8516.9,8520.9,Story of collaboration between hope and our Outreach providers.,,,
1487,0.7415744662284851,8522.2,8535.6,"Miller Park was designated high priority by spr on March 31st, but we were fortunate that we were working with Outreach providers and Outreach was on the ground there.",,,
1488,0.7415744662284851,8535.8,8542.5,"I'm really, they've been on the ground there for a long time, but there were some coordinated efforts happening well in advance of the 31st of March.",,,
1489,0.8747227787971497,8542.9,8547.6, I'm out of our pre Outreach prior to that Parks removal.,,,
1490,0.8747227787971497,8547.8,8553.4,We had 46 referrals to shelter that were made by our Outreach Partners.,,,
1491,0.8747227787971497,8553.9,8564.0,"That's significant in the majority of those referrals were into the Executive Hotel Pacific which again is non-congregate, which is a priority during covid.",,,
1492,0.8747227787971497,8564.0,8570.9,We had really strong partnership between reach Urban League and the Hope team we had.,,,
1493,0.8407769799232483,8572.8,8585.0," You know, as I said, 46 referrals to shelter out of out of Miller Park, and we are aware of six individuals that did not want to accept shelter and voluntarily relocated to a place of their choosing.",,,
1494,0.8407769799232483,8585.4,8591.1,I'm and so that's the kind of work that we are hoping to replicate The Hope.,,,
1495,0.8407769799232483,8591.1,8596.1,Team brings recommendations to the property holding departments about length of Outreach.,,,
1496,0.8407769799232483,8596.8,8602.5,"And again, no, we do not schedule and we do not, we're not the final deciders on that, but we definitely elevated.",,,
1497,0.9128385782241821,8602.6,8606.2, It for for that consideration.,,,
1498,0.752977192401886,8612.2,8616.1, Did you have more there that got cut off at the end?,,,
1499,0.7984384894371033,8619.2,8621.1," Yeah, I'm sorry if I got cut off at the end.",,,
1500,0.7657983303070068,8623.6,8625.7," I mean, but saying, we don't do it.",,,
1501,0.7657983303070068,8626.4,8633.2,"The public sees we as the city, you know, the if hsd doesn't do it, it's still a city posting that's going on.",,,
1502,0.7657983303070068,8633.2,8646.3,"So I'm asking about a Citywide policy that can be more thoughtful and give a longer lead way for organizations on the ground level, to actually do the work and, and, and to make sure that we have time.",,,
1503,0.7657983303070068,8646.3,8653.3,"So that, that bottleneck that we're hearing about, where people are not getting into the hotels that they want because of the bottleneck.",,,
1504,0.9039624929428101,8653.7,8654.7, Is addressed.,,,
1505,0.9039624929428101,8655.1,8657.1,We know that people want to get inside.,,,
1506,0.9039624929428101,8657.2,8663.2,"They don't want to return to congregate shelters where they understand the dangers, Conjuring covid.",,,
1507,0.9039624929428101,8663.2,8666.7,So I think the the answer needs to not be a little.,,,
1508,0.9039624929428101,8666.7,8668.0,It doesn't happen in our department.,,,
1509,0.9039624929428101,8668.0,8668.8,The answer needs to be.,,,
1510,0.9039624929428101,8668.8,8683.4,We have we need a Citywide revamp policy about how long were allowing or giving Community Partners to do the actual work and ideally not having a posting at all because that posting is causing harm right now much harder to,,,
1511,0.7746954560279846,8683.5,8688.6, Find so much harder to get folks into the housing and Health Services that they need.,,,
1512,0.7746954560279846,8688.7,8692.2,If they've been scattered throughout the city because of fear of those posts.,,,
1513,0.9093066453933716,8694.9,8695.3, Thank you.,,,
1514,0.9093066453933716,8695.5,8700.1,Remember I absolutely understand what you are asking for.,,,
1515,0.9093066453933716,8700.2,8700.8,Thank you.,,,
1516,0.9093066453933716,8700.8,8701.7,I appreciate it.,,,

1518,0.8748744130134583,8709.2,8711.0,Give a question council president.,,,
1519,0.8748744130134583,8711.0,8712.3,I should say Gonzalez.,,,
1520,0.8748744130134583,8712.8,8713.0,Okay.,,,
1521,0.8748744130134583,8713.6,8714.8,I answer to many things.,,,
1522,0.8748744130134583,8715.1,8717.9,"Thank you so much, a couple of questions.",,,
1523,0.8748744130134583,8719.7,8723.8,"The first one is around the phrase, high priority.",,,
1524,0.8646456599235535,8725.0,8745.6," And I've heard you all use the phrase, high priority and that, and I understand that it's now being being identified, that sort of identifier, the person who triggers whether or not a publicly owned piece of property is considered a high priority is now determined by the impacted Department.",,,
1525,0.8646456599235535,8746.5,8752.3,"What I haven't quite heard yet is how were defining high-priority, you know, sort of how does that happen?",,,
1526,0.8646456599235535,8753.4,8754.5,What what,,,
1527,0.8323322534561157,8754.8,8766.0," If I'm if I'm an employee or, you know, the director or the superintendent of the Seattle Parks and Recreation Department.",,,
1528,0.8323322534561157,8766.2,8771.7,How do I know what falls into high priority?,,,
1529,0.8323322534561157,8771.7,8780.9,"How do I designate a, a publicly owned piece of property as a high priority area for focus of resources.",,,
1530,0.9128382802009583,8783.6,8784.5, Good question.,,,
1531,0.9128382802009583,8785.0,8796.8,"So I'm going to kind of go back to what I indicated earlier, which is the individual departments, make that decision and generally speaking.",,,
1532,0.9128382802009583,8798.2,8811.6,"They use, as I said before, criteria related to safety to hazards to access as their guiding posts, but frankly, we would need",,,
1533,0.772174596786499,8812.8,8816.4, Bring the weed me to have public that.,,,
1534,0.772174596786499,8816.4,8823.7,"Excuse me, the parks s start City, Light other property-owning, departments, answer.",,,
1535,0.772174596786499,8823.7,8831.4,The question about what specific process they go through individually to identify their sites as being high priority.,,,
1536,0.8393222093582153,8832.6,8840.7," So if I take your answer to its logical conclusion, that means that each department, does it differently?",,,
1537,0.8393222093582153,8841.2,8845.1,"I just wondered I can't answer whether each one, does it differently.",,,
1538,0.8393222093582153,8845.1,8845.5,Again.,,,
1539,0.8393222093582153,8845.5,8849.9,"There's their standard criteria, but the actual discernment process.",,,
1540,0.8393222093582153,8850.3,8857.7,"I can't, I truly don't know, it isn't that I can't answer it, is that I truly do not know what the nuanced process is.",,,
1541,0.8393222093582153,8857.7,8858.8,That each one goes through.,,,
1542,0.8393222093582153,8859.0,8862.2,I will say that there's a weekly meeting where all of the property.,,,

1544,0.6972944140434265,8880.8,8892.2,"Okay, so so then I go because so what I'm hearing you say then is that hsd and the Hope team does not play a role in the",,,

1552,0.7693910002708435,8944.4,8950.6,So the broad criteria is hazards to people or to City infrastructure.,,,
1553,0.7693910002708435,8950.6,8951.9,So there's that safety issue.,,,
1554,0.7693910002708435,8951.9,8960.2,"Again, it is whether or not an encampment might be impeding a City construction or maintenance project.",,,

1666,0.9128384590148926,9631.5,9641.2,So in addition to all of the work that our hope team is doing we are still of course focused on standing up new shelter resources that were funded in the 2021 budget.,,,
1667,0.9128384590148926,9641.4,9649.5,So this year so far we've opened to temporary hotel shelters and we have already added more enhanced shelter.,,,
1668,0.9128384590148926,9649.9,9652.8,So this summer we are also,,,

1674,0.7902340292930603,9691.1,9694.4,"And in fact, it is fairly strained at this point.",,,
1675,0.7902340292930603,9694.9,9706.9,The single biggest barrier to opening new programs across the city is not the commitment of the department or the city family at large to addressing unsheltered homelessness.,,,
1676,0.7902340292930603,9707.0,9712.8,"It is provider capacity to take on more work Staffing, particularly hiring new staff.",,,
1677,0.8307320475578308,9713.0,9715.3, Is a challenge across all programs.,,,
1678,0.8307320475578308,9715.3,9721.2,"And so, a quick example, shelter opened a new women's shelter recently.",,,

1718,0.765487790107727,9941.5,9946.9,So I'm going to wrap us up with a quick description of what our pipeline looks like.,,,
1719,0.765487790107727,9946.9,9961.9,"Moving forward for context just to reiterate, what we've been doing so far during the first quarter of the year at hsd staff supported, an increase of almost 400 new enhanced show shelter spaces.",,,
1720,0.765487790107727,9962.2,9968.0,So what's important about that is that increase in spaces actually has,,,
1721,0.8743762969970703,9968.1,9971.0, Our overall percentage of enhanced shelters within our system.,,,
1722,0.8743762969970703,9971.0,9977.0,"To 89% sits up, that's up from 73% at the end of 2020.",,,
1723,0.8743762969970703,9978.1,9986.8,"Then I bring that up because I think it's important for us to remember that, even, as we're looking forward.",,,
1724,0.8743762969970703,9986.8,9997.9,"We are still engaging presently in this new growth, as with all enhanced shelter and Villages, the new beds that we have stood up and that we will stand",,,
1725,0.7343594431877136,9998.0,10008.0," Tup have wraparound services, including Behavioral Health supports, and housing, navigation, to support people as they are moving into permanent housing.",,,
1726,0.7343594431877136,10008.6,10019.2,"So what we're doing, in addition to that, even as we stand up those first two hotels, we are considering citing and operating options for a third Hotel.",,,
1727,0.7343594431877136,10020.1,10021.5,"This done, this summer.",,,

1732,0.9033754467964172,10043.2,10047.7,So we are committed to delivering on the full.,,,

1740,0.7857630848884583,10065.8,10071.5,"I have a few to kick us off, and then I see council members Gaeta has a hand up there.",,,
1741,0.7857630848884583,10071.5,10086.5,"So, you know, the first thing I want to do is I do want to address the provider capacity issue because I know that is a big issue, you know, like you guys, I talked to providers in a regular basis and they relay back.",,,
1742,0.7857630848884583,10086.5,10087.6,That's problem.,,,
1743,0.7857630848884583,10088.3,10088.8,One.,,,
1744,0.7857630848884583,10089.2,10091.0,"Corollary though, that's expressed.",,,
1745,0.7857630848884583,10091.0,10091.9,And I don't want to,,,
1746,0.888919472694397,10092.7,10104.5," You know, say which provider but it's been several is that, you know, to a certain extent, the resource conversation is related to the amount of money.",,,
1747,0.888919472694397,10104.5,10111.1,We put out for rfps for programmatic expansion and it some of the feedback I get is.,,,
1748,0.9035226702690125,10111.9,10125.2," If the city can commit, and I think this council is committed to it and, and willing to, to affirm our commitment, to it, to ongoing streams for operations.",,,
1749,0.9035226702690125,10125.2,10135.2,"For some of these shelter, options, providers would be able to respond to an RFP staff up and scale up knowing that that'll be there.",,,
1750,0.9035226702690125,10135.2,10139.4,So there is a what I've been led to believe from.,,,
1751,0.9035226702690125,10139.4,10141.9,Some of these providers is there is a little bit of kind of,,,
1752,0.900201141834259,10141.9,10143.3, Chicken in the egg with this.,,,
1753,0.900201141834259,10143.9,10154.9,"We're just getting that RFP out into the field, can have an impact that that will help them be able to staff up to rise to that challenge.",,,
1754,0.900201141834259,10155.3,10171.6,"And I'm just throwing that out there given that and, you know, those sort of answered on the last slide because I am excited about working with the Department on getting these rfps out for more tiny house Villages, as we heard in public comment for that third hotel, but it",,,
1755,0.8528792858123779,10171.9,10185.8," seems like one of the bottlenecks in our control and the capacity conversation is getting those rfps out and getting it out into that space, where the providers can then respond and write on them.",,,
1756,0.8528792858123779,10185.8,10192.4,"And then when they're admitted, they can accordingly adjust their Staffing to meet the challenge.",,,
1757,0.8528792858123779,10192.8,10200.9,"So I guess, I just wanted to throw that out there here to see, you know, if the council sends additional resources through the American Recovery Act,",,,
1758,0.9128383994102478,10201.7,10208.5, Because the first thing what's the turnaround and how fast we can get those rfps out there?,,,
1759,0.9128383994102478,10208.5,10212.3,So people can start responding to them to meet the scale of the crisis.,,,
1760,0.9128383994102478,10213.2,10214.9,The second question would be,,,
1761,0.8413223624229431,10216.3,10230.7," You know, and this is more speculative right now, but just for the sake of understanding the implications of this discussion, you know, it's possible next year that the department is going to have to stand up 2,000 units within a year.",,,
1762,0.8413223624229431,10231.0,10238.7,"If there's a charter amendment that creates that mandate, how are we going to position these capacity conversations to respond to that mandate?",,,
1763,0.8413223624229431,10238.7,10242.0,"Which, which is if we want to fundamentally solve, this issue.",,,
1764,0.8413223624229431,10242.0,10242.5,We are facing.,,,
1765,0.8413223624229431,10242.5,10244.6,We need to have a response of that scale.,,,
1766,0.8413223624229431,10245.1,10245.7,I think the,,,
1767,0.783250629901886,10245.8,10260.1," Those committed to sending those kinds of resources over, but if we could get an exchange right now about what you guys need to effectually implement that, you know, we're willing to do.",,,
1768,0.8759609460830688,10261.3,10265.4," Whatever it takes to Be an Effective partner there, to help you get that accomplished.",,,
1769,0.8759609460830688,10266.1,10268.9,"So there's a lot in there, but I'll test.",,,
1770,0.8759609460830688,10268.9,10272.3,I'll let you baby moderate out the answers to that.,,,
1771,0.8759609460830688,10272.3,10274.7,And then I'll recognize council member Mesquita.,,,
1772,0.8759609460830688,10276.2,10276.9,It's thank you.,,,
1773,0.8759609460830688,10277.1,10290.9,We would welcome the opportunity to continue conversations with you about potential solutions for what we too are hearing are significant constraints that the,,,
1774,0.8616027235984802,10291.1,10292.5, Is are experiencing.,,,
1775,0.8616027235984802,10293.6,10295.5,"I will say, full disclosure.",,,
1776,0.8616027235984802,10295.5,10304.2,I'm not in a position to talk about ways in which that the amendment could or could not be implemented.,,,
1777,0.8616027235984802,10304.9,10309.4,But we share your concern and are happy to continue in dialogue with you about that.,,,
1778,0.8616027235984802,10310.0,10311.7,"Well, deputy director.",,,
1779,0.8616027235984802,10311.7,10314.9,"Maybe why don't we talk about in the abstract and just say,",,,
1780,0.9127380847930908,10316.5,10319.0," for the sake of argument, what would it take to stand up?",,,
1781,0.9127380847930908,10319.0,10320.9,"2,000 units of housing in a year.",,,
1782,0.9127380847930908,10322.0,10323.7,That's a great question.,,,
1783,0.9127380847930908,10323.7,10327.5,And to be honest with you at this point.,,,
1784,0.9127380847930908,10327.5,10332.7,I'm not I just I don't feel like I'm in a position to actually have an abstract conversation about that.,,,
1785,0.9127380847930908,10332.9,10340.8,So I'm going to politely request that we be able to think about this and enter into conversation with you about that.,,,
1786,0.8124433755874634,10341.9,10343.0," Alright, fair enough.",,,
1787,0.8124433755874634,10343.0,10347.7,"I mean we we have some time to think about it, but we might have to be thinking about it pretty quick.",,,
1788,0.8124433755874634,10347.7,10352.4,"And in short order councilmember skated, you have some questions.",,,
