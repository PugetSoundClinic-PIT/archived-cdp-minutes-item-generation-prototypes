892,0.97,4720.315,4729.991,I think that this level of relief that we're providing is not only needed but essential for us to have a healthy community and a more robust economy on the end.,186,,
893,0.97,4729.991,4737.065,This is both about the physical health of the population and also about the resiliency of our city in the long run.,186,,
894,0.97,4737.065,4748.477,I will turn it over to Council members that have offered other changes to the base amendment for any additional Coms that you want to make to highlight.,186,,
895,0.97,4748.477,4755.55,Any additional comment that's folks would want to make.,186,,
896,0.97,4755.55,4756.084,Council member Herbold.,186,,
897,0.97,4756.084,4767.729,"So first off, I want to thank the chair, council member Mosqueda, for bringing forward this Consolidated amendment representing the interest of several Council members.",187,,
898,0.97,4767.729,4789.751,I also want to thank the chair for including in this Consolidated amendment new language that makes it clear that funds for sheltering associated with Covid-19 cannot be used for shelters.,187,,
899,0.97,4789.751,4796.892,And I just want to speak very briefly about one of the elements of the amendments that is included.,187,,
900,0.97,4796.892,4804.533,And then I have a question about another element sponsored by another Council member.,187,,
901,0.97,4804.533,4833.161,"So specifically as it relates to the amendment for aid to immigrant refugee households, really thankful for the cooperation of the office of immigrant refugee affairs in developing this amendment and the support of Council President Gonzalez as well.",187,,
902,0.97,4833.161,4849.077,"Income tested benefit eligibility can be very complex for households to navigate, especially in a year when households may be receiving more than one type of unplanned assistance from local, state or Federal governments.",187,,
903,0.97,4849.077,4860.755,And the community based organization of course who help navigate--help clients navigate the programs themselves might have questions about how benefit and support programs interact.,187,,
904,0.97,4860.755,4881.476,So really thankful that this amendment will help make it possible for organizations and clients to access and provide advice to the folks receiving these benefits so that no one inadvertently loses needed benefits in accepting the assistance from the city.,187,,
905,0.97,4881.476,4914.409,"As it relates to one of the questions I have about the mandatory language in section 4A, related to nonprofit organizations who are eligible for support from the office of economic development, I'm interested to know the intent with the preference for brick and mortar small businesses and whether or not that is intended to Prioritize brick and mortar small businesses over other types of recipients, including Nonprofits.",187,,
906,0.97,4914.409,4925.754,Or is it meant to Brior advertise brick and mortar small business over other types of small businesses with the understanding that Nonprofits are part of that definition?,187,,
907,0.97,4925.754,4957.552,"I recognize that brick and mortar businesses may have greater costs associated with the maintenance and upkeep of a space, rent on a space, but I'm just trying to figure out whether or not that allows nonprofit that's are brick and mortar small businesses to be Prioritized.",187,,
908,0.97,4957.552,4957.886,Thank you.,188,,
909,0.97,4957.886,4964.726,"Council member Strauss, would you like to speak to that.",189,,
910,0.97,4964.726,4964.993,Yes.,190,,
911,0.97,4964.993,4965.527,My apologies.,190,,
912,0.97,4965.527,4966.761,My camera was off before.,190,,
913,0.97,4966.761,4970.966,I want to address the great questions right there.,190,,
914,0.97,4970.966,4974.602,And Council member Mosqueda can fill in any areas that I don't cover.,190,,
915,0.97,4974.602,4990.685,"The preference for brick and mortar businesses is the latter of what you discussed, meaning that businesses operating a space should be Prioritized over businesses that are--that don't have a space to operate physical brick and mortar space.",190,,
916,0.97,4990.685,4996.725,There was no intention of Prioritizing that over Nonprofits.,190,,
917,0.97,4996.725,5000.228,And so clarifying language is needed.,190,,
918,0.97,5000.228,5000.662,Happy to accept it.,190,,
919,0.97,5008.47,5009.337,I'll echo that.,191,,
920,0.97,5009.337,5017.545,"We got feedback asking how does this reconcile the impact that Covid has had on store fronts, brick and mortar entities.",191,,
921,0.97,5017.545,5018.847,So you're absolutely correct.,191,,
922,0.97,5018.847,5021.483,And I agree with Council member Strauss.,191,,
923,0.97,5021.483,5026.254,It would include those Nonprofits as well.,191,,
924,0.97,5026.254,5030.358,"And did you have a Follow- up, council member Herbold.",192,,
925,0.97,5030.358,5032.093,That is it.,193,,
926,0.97,5032.093,5034.362,I saw Council member Strauss' hand.,194,,
927,0.97,5034.362,5036.831,"If there are other hands, let me know.",194,,
928,0.97,5036.831,5044.973,Just wanted to speak to the substitute.,195,,
929,0.97,5044.973,5046.207,Thanks for putting this together.,195,,
930,0.97,5046.207,5050.545,Rather than having to vote on each amendment separately.,195,,
931,0.97,5050.545,5064.592,Working with you and Council President Gonzalez we worked to increase the eligibility for small businesses to support any business with up to ten Ftes rather than five employees total.,195,,
932,0.97,5064.592,5079.307,"Why this is important is Ftes, if there are two part-time employees, this expands the number of businesses that are able to be supported by our relief.",195,,
933,0.97,5079.307,5085.313,And specifically it helps address businesses that have part-time workers and labor heavy business.,195,,
934,0.97,5085.313,5093.888,"This change will allow more of our small businesses, restaurants with part-time workers to receive this funding.",195,,
935,0.97,5093.888,5108.002,"And just for reference for colleagues, I had originally started this amendment with the number of 25Fte.",195,,
936,0.97,5108.002,5112.14,The ten FTE was the agreed number for this substitute.,195,,
937,0.97,5112.14,5119.581,I believe that a higher FTE would better serve our businesses during Kodi Lee.,195,,
938,0.97,5119.581,5128.823,"Not to make amendments on the fly on the, I will discuss with you over the next cupful days.",195,,
939,0.97,5128.823,5135.73,I may bring an amendment to increase the FTE on Monday.,195,,
940,0.97,5135.73,5150.378,Don't want to confuse the very deliberate conversation that we have today so we move forward N addition to that I worked to add Nonprofits with up to ten Ftes to be eligible for the support.,195,,
941,0.97,5150.378,5157.218,"They must be Nonprofits that provide services to the community's health, safety, environment or general welfare.",195,,
942,0.97,5157.218,5164.492,Last week or two weeks ago I spoke to the nature of Nonprofits and how Nonprofits are just another tax status.,195,,
943,0.97,5164.492,5176.538,"And so I wanted to make sure that when we are looking at Nonprofits, we are specifically focusing on those organization that's are providing services.",195,,
944,0.97,5176.538,5188.283,"These words were taken directly out of our city's Charter, the preamble to our city's charter as demonstrating what we as a city need to be doing for our residents.",195,,
945,0.97,5188.283,5191.052,That's why I U█Sed those words.,195,,
946,0.97,5191.052,5192.02,Those are my remarks.,195,,
947,0.97,5192.02,5195.49,Thanks for all of your work Council member Mosqueda.,195,,
948,0.97,5195.49,5199.227,Thank you Council member Strauss.,196,,
949,0.97,5199.227,5204.365,Are there any additional comments?,196,,
950,0.97,5204.365,5208.403,I'm not seeing or hearing any from the folks on the line.,196,,
951,0.97,5208.403,5210.004,Thank you for your feedback.,196,,
952,0.97,5210.004,5216.411,Obviously is this a detailed bill that has many Council members' finger prints on it.,196,,
953,0.97,5216.411,5220.348,We will have the chance for additional comments on Monday.,196,,
954,0.97,5220.348,5237.131,Thank you for your input on amendment 1. it has been moved and Seconded to move amendment 1. will the clerk please call the roll on adoption of amendment 1.,196,,
955,0.97,5237.131,5244.973,"Madam clerk, I think you might be on mute.",197,,
956,0.97,5244.973,5249.243,It's been a morning of technical difficulties.,197,,
957,0.97,5249.243,5252.18,Let's see if the clerk's office is still with us.,197,,
958,0.97,5252.18,5254.716,"It, if you could confirm that.",197,,
959,0.97,5254.716,5256.918,That would be great.,197,,

983,0.97,5302.13,5305.633,Would you like to go ahead and move that.,217,,
984,0.97,5305.633,5306.301,Yes.,218,,
985,0.97,5306.301,5307.268,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",218,,
986,0.97,5307.268,5310.905,"I move that we--got, I don't have the script.",218,,
987,0.97,5310.905,5314.342,I move that we consider amendment 2.,218,,
988,0.97,5314.342,5314.809,Thank you.,219,,
989,0.97,5314.809,5319.947,It has been moved as presented is there a second . He agenda.,219,,
990,0.97,5319.947,5320.248,Second.,220,,
991,0.97,5320.248,5326.454,Been moved and Seconded to consider amendment 2 as presented on the agenda and described by central staff.,221,,
992,0.97,5326.454,5331.926,"Central staff, walk us through it and then we will consider comments and possible vote.",221,,
993,0.97,5335.596,5351.479,Allocates at least $3.6 million of the 10.8 million that is allocated under the immediate housing category for shelter efforts to establish new tiny home villages.,222,,
994,0.97,5351.479,5364.225,"This had accommodate between four to five new villages depending on a variety of factors including the opening date to provide services at the village in 2020, site conditions and size of the village.",222,,
995,0.97,5364.225,5372.266,Any new villages established in 2020 will have an ongoing operational cost that will require identifying funding to support such operations.,222,,
996,0.97,5372.266,5382.777,I understand the sponsors are working on identifying sources of funding for that ongoing need for these villages and others.,222,,
997,0.97,5382.777,5383.411,Okay.,223,,
998,0.97,5383.411,5389.384,"Council member Morales is as sponsor of this amendment, would you like to speak to it.",223,,
999,0.97,5389.384,5389.65,Yes.,224,,
1000,0.97,5389.65,5389.951,Thank you.,224,,
1001,0.97,5389.951,5395.59,Let me make sure that I'm not on mute.,224,,
1002,0.97,5395.59,5396.057,Thank you.,224,,
1003,0.97,5396.057,5404.732,"As Allie said, this would allocate 3.6 million specifically for small tiny home--tiny House villages.",224,,
1004,0.97,5404.732,5412.206,"And I do want to acknowledge, you know, we've got a lot of comments and calls about this particular amendment.",224,,
1005,0.97,5412.206,5421.849,I think it is important to note that we all agree that the long- term solution to our housing crisis is to build more housing.,224,,
1006,0.97,5421.849,5430.091,Particularly for folks who are very low income and who need transitional housing and more assistance in that way.,224,,
1007,0.97,5430.091,5435.863,"That said, right now we have 2500 unsheltered neighbor who's are living outside.",224,,
1008,0.97,5435.863,5444.405,So we need fast solutions to help them get indoors before the winter comes and before their risk of exposure to Coronavirus increases.,224,,
1009,0.97,5444.405,5448.709,We know that that is definitely still a problem in our community.,224,,
1010,0.97,5448.709,5450.578,And will continue to be for quite some time.,224,,
1011,0.97,5450.578,5458.719,"You know, the other issue is that the Mayor does keep talking about the 95 units that they have funded.",224,,
1012,0.97,5458.719,5461.055,But we know there is so much more to do.,224,,
1013,0.97,5461.055,5461.956,It is not nearly enough.,224,,
1014,0.97,5461.956,5466.961,It needs to be done quickly to help move people off the streets.,224,,
1015,0.97,5466.961,5480.007,"So, you know, we believe that this amendment is important because for less than $4 million, we would more than double that number, that 95, and help people get off the street.",224,,
1016,0.97,5480.007,5486.781,Couple that with the funding from Esg and we can sustain these villages for several years.,224,,
1017,0.97,5486.781,5494.655,We still have millions of dollars left for hotels and for other alternatives in addition to this.,224,,
1018,0.97,5494.655,5510.505,"So I also want to acknowledge that, you know, the tiny House villages are not the answer for everyone.",224,,
1019,0.97,5510.505,5510.872,Folks who need.,224,,
1020,0.97,5510.872,5515.576,Behavioral services won't get that kind of management in a tiny House village.,225,,
1021,0.97,5515.576,5519.981,"But it can help many people get off the street, particularly before the winter time comes.",225,,
1022,0.97,5519.981,5526.087,It is a type of shelter that is commonly asked for people experiencing homelessness.,225,,
1023,0.97,5526.087,5535.029,I've had many people myself tell me directly as I've been to some of the encampment Removals.,225,,
1024,0.97,5535.029,5537.098,That they would prefer that to living under the highway.,225,,
1025,0.97,5537.098,5543.337,Those are some of the reasons that we're proposing this amendment.,225,,
1026,0.97,5543.337,5546.04,And I'm happy to answer any questions.,225,,
1027,0.97,5546.04,5550.745,"Council member Lewis, as cosponsor, would you like to speak to the amendment.",226,,
1028,0.97,5550.745,5551.712,"Yes, Madam chair.",227,,
1029,0.97,5551.712,5561.622,I want to say from the outset it has been a privilege to work with Council member Morales and follow her leadership on shaping this amendment.,227,,
1030,0.97,5561.622,5580.541,Do follow through on a commitment that a lot of us on this Council share of really what we've been frustrated about over the last several months where we were seeing increasingly visible chronic homelessness and so much want on the streets of our city and in our community.,227,,
1031,0.97,5580.541,5589.784,And not being able to summon a sense of urgency to get more placement for people to successfully living from Encampments on the street.,227,,
1032,0.97,5589.784,5591.819,I'm proud to support this amendment today.,227,,
1033,0.97,5591.819,5605.199,"You know, I do want to briefly address a couple of concerns that I have heard from some folks in the provider community about the amendment.",227,,
1034,0.97,5605.199,5617.612,Perhaps being a little too prescriptive and carving off a segment of the money that is allocated.,227,,
1035,0.97,5617.612,5627.888,"I appreciate we have providers out there doing important work in pursuing different strategies, including Hoteling, including, you know, other forms of enhanced shelter.",227,,
1036,0.97,5627.888,5655.516,"But I really do think just based on the work that we've been doing over the past 7 months and really engaging with the people that are doing outreach too, like workers with reach and workers with a lot of our other partners that one of the most demanded placements as Council member Morales alluded to to folks doing the outreach work from people experiencing chronic homelessness are placements in these tiny House villages.",227,,
1037,0.97,5655.516,5671.232,"I think in terms of the level of investment for the village, in terms of the number of spots, and the stability and comfort that these villages provide to people, it is an investment that we need to be pursuing.",227,,
1038,0.97,5671.232,5682.309,"You know, I echo Council member Morales' comments that we know that ultimately what we really need is permanent supportive housing and the tiny House villages do not go far enough.",227,,
1039,0.97,5682.309,5689.984,But we're in a position right now where we have thousands of people living unsheltered who need a place where they can go right now.,227,,
1040,0.97,5689.984,5692.42,We can scale up tiny House villages quickly.,227,,
1041,0.97,5692.42,5698.125,We know that they are popular with folks that are experiencing homelessness.,227,,
1042,0.97,5698.125,5709.136,And I'm proud to support this amendment as something that can make some material progress on the challenges that we're seeing on our streets.,227,,
1043,0.97,5709.136,5710.337,Okay.,228,,
1044,0.97,5710.337,5711.605,Thank you very much.,228,,
1045,0.97,5711.605,5719.48,"Council colleagues, any comments or questions on amendment 2? Council member Pedersen, did you have a comment?",228,,
1046,0.97,5719.48,5720.581,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",229,,
1047,0.97,5720.581,5729.69,Do we know how many units of housing or how many units of the tiny homes the 3.6 million would create?,229,,
1048,0.97,5729.69,5742.336,And do we know what housing providers are qualified and available to provide five of these villages?,229,,
1049,0.97,5742.336,5748.576,So I think the average number of units per village is about 50.,230,,
1050,0.97,5748.576,5762.323,"So, you know, depending on how many--how many we are able to fund with this, we could be providing 250 units, tiny homes for people.",230,,
1051,0.97,5762.323,5769.063,At this point there is really only one provider who we are regularly contracting with to do this.,230,,
1052,0.97,5769.063,5772.5,But that's not to say that there aren't others that could step in.,230,,
1053,0.97,5772.5,5787.014,"You know, I think part of the challenge is that there is a--right now anyway, the way that these villages are operating, there is a relationship I guess with the NAV team.",230,,
1054,0.97,5787.014,5789.917,So they are making decisions about who gets access to these.,230,,
1055,0.97,5789.917,5807.535,"I think that is problematic and we need to make sure that if we are able to build another 250 units that those--you know, reach workers, outreach workers are able to get access to those more directly.",230,,
1056,0.97,5807.535,5817.945,And we have some other amendments later on in the conversation that we hope to help address that with as well.,230,,
1057,0.97,5817.945,5818.312,Thank you.,231,,
1058,0.97,5818.312,5826.487,Did I see Council member Herbold's hand?,231,,
1059,0.97,5826.487,5828.055,Please.,231,,
1060,0.97,5828.055,5828.422,Thank you.,232,,
1061,0.97,5828.422,5836.297,I have a question that I don't know if the sponsors are ready to answer.,232,,
1062,0.97,5836.297,5849.877,Just trying to get a handle on what happened to the funds that the Council provided in last year's budget process specifically for tiny House villages?,232,,
1063,0.97,5849.877,5862.756,The message that I have from my staff is that there are no more funds in the 2020 budget for tiny House villages.,232,,
1064,0.97,5862.756,5872.399,And that those funds were not--were not spent for tiny House villages in totality as intended by the Council.,232,,
1065,0.97,5872.399,5877.571,So I would like to know a little bit more about that.,232,,
1066,0.97,5877.571,5880.541,And then question for the sponsors.,232,,
1067,0.97,5880.541,5892.286,Just interested to know what the plan is for continuing operations for both 2020 and 2021.,232,,
1068,0.97,5892.286,5900.261,"Is that--are the cost estimates provided in the proposal, do those include operating costs for 2020?",232,,
1069,0.97,5900.261,5907.001,Is the intent for 2021 for operating costs to come out of the jump start revenue?,232,,
1070,0.97,5907.001,5915.442,"And my second question is, I whole heartedly support the funding of additional tiny House villages.",232,,
1071,0.97,5915.442,5927.254,But I am sympathetic to some of the concerns that we might be being too pre descriptive in this amendment for funding for tiny House villages.,232,,
1072,0.97,5927.254,5940.334,"But could be--could feel otherwise if I was confident that the city and the operator are, you know, as they say ready to go, to stand up new villages before the year's end.",232,,
1073,0.97,5940.334,5952.346,I just don't want to tie this funding to one option if that--if that one particular model isn't ready to use the resources.,232,,
1074,0.97,5952.346,5961.989,"And if they're not, then maybe we should consider making the resources available to a broader number of models.",232,,
1075,0.97,5961.989,5962.289,Thank you.,232,,
1076,0.97,5962.289,5963.991,"Thank you, council member Herbold.",233,,
1077,0.97,5963.991,5967.695,We are beginning to look at that.,233,,
1078,0.97,5967.695,5972.733,"As I said, we are considering funding in part for some of the operations.",233,,
1079,0.97,5972.733,5987.014,But can talk with central staff as well to see if there's a way to be additive to the funding that we had considered that we thought earlier in the year was going to support operations.,233,,
1080,0.97,5993.52,5995.789,"Council member Strauss, please go ahead.",234,,
1081,0.97,5995.789,5997.224,Council member Strauss.,234,,
1082,0.97,5997.224,5997.891,I believe you're still on mute.,234,,
1083,0.97,5997.891,5998.258,Thank you.,235,,
1084,0.97,5998.258,6001.762,It is better than the opposite I would say.,235,,
1085,0.97,6001.762,6003.23,Thank you chair Mosqueda.,235,,
1086,0.97,6003.23,6009.236,I have to echo Council member Herbold's point.,235,,
1087,0.97,6009.236,6016.043,It provides four walls and a roof over their head to ensure that somebody has the appropriate shelter they need.,235,,
1088,0.97,6016.043,6029.39,I am a little concerned about the pre Scriptive nature of this amendment.,235,,
1089,0.97,6029.39,6031.625,Did Council member Morales' answer--did she answer your question?,235,,
1090,0.97,6031.625,6032.926,I was left a little unclear.,235,,
1091,0.97,6032.926,6038.165,I think she answered the question that I had about operating costs.,236,,
1092,0.97,6038.165,6054.681,I did not hear a response to the question about whether or not the operator and the city were sort of ready to stand up the number of tiny House village that's would correspond to the funding that we're looking at making available in 2020.,236,,
1093,0.97,6054.681,6065.192,And then I also had the question for central staff around the already allocated 2020 money for tiny House villages.,236,,
1094,0.97,6065.192,6066.093,Thank you for checking.,236,,
1095,0.97,6066.093,6066.36,Yes.,237,,
1096,0.97,6066.36,6074.068,"Council memo owe before I go to the Council sponsors, Allie, did you have a response to Council member Herbold's question?",238,,
1097,0.97,6074.068,6077.07,"Well, I have--we will respond to your question.",239,,
1098,0.97,6077.07,6094.188,But I want to delay responding fully until this afternoon when my colleague Jeff Sims is on the line who will have a better sense of all of the moving pieces for the funding to support tiny homes adopted in the 2020 budget.,239,,
1099,0.97,6094.188,6101.261,The funding that has been used in the Covid response efforts in 2020 already.,239,,
1100,0.97,6101.261,6105.632,And then I can confirm that this is in addition to any of that.,239,,
1101,0.97,6105.632,6109.603,But I can't fully answer your question exactly tracing those dollars.,239,,
1102,0.97,6109.603,6114.374,So I have flagged for him that we will need a response to that question this afternoon to follow up.,239,,
1103,0.97,6114.374,6123.617,"I will confirm also that these estimates, the reason why we're saying four to five villages is it depends on when they hope.",239,,
1104,0.97,6123.617,6129.756,It does build in service costs in 2020 but it depends on when they open and the cost of the service.,239,,
1105,0.97,6129.756,6132.292,So it is making some assumptions.,239,,
1106,0.97,6132.292,6139.333,"And in the amendment sheet itself, there is a table to sort of provides a couple of different scenarios.",239,,
1107,0.97,6139.333,6139.967,It includes service cost.,239,,
1108,0.97,6139.967,6150.577,"As Council member Morales and Lewis spoke to there, looking at other sources of funding in the operation costs.",239,,
1109,0.97,6150.577,6161.822,I will note that this bill includes some ongoing funding to continue some of the investments to address the Covid epidemic in 2021 as well.,239,,
1110,0.97,6161.822,6170.597,But doesn't decided to about exactly which of these programs will need the ongoing funding that will be decided for the adoption of the 2021 budget.,239,,
1111,0.97,6170.597,6175.135,Before I turn it back over to--thumbs up for Council member Herbold.,240,,
1112,0.97,6175.135,6177.804,Thank you for answering that question.,240,,
1113,0.97,6177.804,6185.846,"Before I turn it over to the cosponsors, I have give you my feedback.",240,,
1114,0.97,6185.846,6190.117,It looks like Council member Sawant has a comment too and Council member Gonzalez.,240,,
1115,0.97,6190.117,6203.53,I will do mine and then go back through Council member Sawant and Council President Gonzalez and wrap it up with the sponsors.,240,,
1116,0.97,6203.53,6215.442,I want to thank you for bringing this forward.,240,,
1117,0.97,6215.442,6226.42,We heard they support additional funding for shelters that would include tiny House villages as the language is currently written but they ask that we keep this language the same so that the funding can remain flexible.,240,,
1118,0.97,6226.42,6235.062,I think in speaking with some of the folks we heard broad consensus Onset asides.,240,,
1119,0.97,6235.062,6238.298,They are a huge supporter and have supported them in the past.,240,,
1120,0.97,6238.298,6256.516,One of the things that had been raised was the many benefits of tiny houses are really important and sometimes the design cannot always support the needs for people with severe disabilities or behavior health conditions.,240,,
1121,0.97,6256.516,6280.841,"Specifically to the Covid crisis we're trying to respond to in this bill, I'm specifically interested in keeping the language flexible so we can offer this both for tiny House villages which they are ready to be stood up quickly and acquiring or renting rooms in motels and hotels such as the Aloha Inn thanks to our partners offering some of their surface.",240,,
1122,0.97,6280.841,6289.249,"If we had additional funding, we know those rooms could dovetail to get additional funds into tiny House villages in the future.",240,,
1123,0.97,6289.249,6300.994,I will continue to work with all of you to allocate more money for tiny House villages and follow up since they did not spend the money allocated previously.,240,,
1124,0.97,6300.994,6303.33,I know that is frustrating for all of us.,240,,
1125,0.97,6303.33,6311.705,But I would be advocating for folks to pass on this amendment today so we can keep the language flexible and it does still include tiny House villages.,240,,
1126,0.97,6311.705,6319.046,With that I'm going to turn it over to Council member Sawant and Council President Gonzalez.,240,,
1127,0.97,6319.046,6320.147,Thank you.,241,,
1128,0.97,6320.147,6324.418,I will be voting yes on this amendment.,241,,
1129,0.97,6324.418,6331.758,The set aside of this kind for tiny House villages.,241,,
1130,0.97,6331.758,6354.581,Because tiny House villages keep getting short changed in the sense that we want all kinds of options but in my view we need to fund the options that work the best based on the feedback that we have received from homeless neighbors themselves who have been through homelessness and who can tell us from first hand experience what works and doesn't work.,241,,
1131,0.97,6354.581,6360.42,Tiny House villages have proven themselves to be the best shelter option short of affordable housing.,241,,
1132,0.97,6360.42,6365.559,They have community and the safety and dignity of your own private space.,241,,
1133,0.97,6365.559,6372.632,Tiny House villages were fought for and one by homeless neighbors themselves and the people who stood with them because they work.,241,,
1134,0.97,6372.632,6393.086,"Tiny House villages work both from the perspective of helping people find permanent housing and from the perspective of the quality of life for the people living there, S dignity and the humanity that they receive in addition to the specific facilities that they are able to access as human beings, as families and as community members.",241,,
1135,0.97,6393.086,6399.893,My office has been proud to support homeless activists fighting for tiny House villages since I first took office in 2014.,241,,
1136,0.97,6399.893,6403.23,And I'm happy to support this expansion as well.,241,,
1137,0.97,6403.23,6419.346,The people's budget movement year after year fighting during the budget has won the first funding to support homeless Encampments in the first place that led to the legislation to allow Encampments be officially permitted.,241,,
1138,0.97,6419.346,6423.049,This year we won our Legislature expanding the permits throughout the city.,241,,
1139,0.97,6423.049,6425.085,We did this in early January.,241,,
1140,0.97,6425.085,6444.905,"Last fall working closely with tiny House village residents, share wheel, hundreds of people activists we were able to win $2 million.",241,,
1141,0.97,6444.905,6450.243,I have heard from hundreds of homeless people who say that this works.,241,,
1142,0.97,6450.243,6462.589,More than 500 people signed petitions calling for more tiny House villages and dozens of type Ehouse village residents and other advocates have shown up to testify at meetings.,241,,
1143,0.97,6462.589,6470.197,A group of 43 faith leaders signed a letter to city council calling for more tiny House villages.,241,,
1144,0.97,6470.197,6474.434,Some of the same pastors advocating for the affordable homes in the central district.,241,,
1145,0.97,6474.434,6481.441,I was able to lead a press conference with the true hope tiny House village with Collegery and residents some months ago.,241,,
1146,0.97,6481.441,6505.866,We did not win the full demand of $12 million but our $2 million victory was a big step in the direction of winning more funds and the amendment before the Council today represents another step in our goal to build enough tiny House villages to get everyone in Seattle into stable shelter with community and services.,241,,
1147,0.97,6505.866,6509.135,This will be another victory for our moment.,241,,
1148,0.97,6509.135,6522.482,"Now, this afternoon when Council discusses the 2020 budget, we will be discussing a similar budget amendment that comes from my office and from the people's budget to fund the expansion of five tiny House villages.",241,,
1149,0.97,6522.482,6539.566,The amendment that I will be bringing forward is intended for--to be funded through funds obtained from FEMA reimbursement or the navigation team that carries out.,241,,
1150,0.97,6539.566,6542.469,I want today mention that as an aside.,241,,
1151,0.97,6542.469,6546.006,I fully intend to support funding for tiny House villages in general.,241,,
1152,0.97,6546.006,6551.478,And I hope Council members will do the same.,241,,
1153,0.97,6551.478,6554.948,And have explicit set aside for tiny House villages.,241,,
1154,0.97,6554.948,6561.087,I will vote yet and I will continue to pursue funding through other parts of the 2020 budget including this afternoon.,241,,
1155,0.97,6561.087,6568.528,And I urge all Council members to support expanding type Ehouse villages if not now at least in the discussion this afternoon.,241,,
1156,0.97,6568.528,6575.802,And then when we take a vote in the summer budge set and also when we come back for the autumn budget.,241,,
1157,0.97,6575.802,6577.604,Thank you.,241,,
1158,0.97,6577.604,6579.506,"Council member Sawant, thank you.",242,,
1159,0.97,6579.506,6581.241,Just a quick question.,243,,
1160,0.97,6581.241,6588.648,"And Allie, you may or may not have the answer to this quite yet.",243,,
1161,0.97,6588.648,6610.303,"In terms of the anticipated or desired additional four to five tiny home villages, can you just give me a sense of whether you know whether the sort of--what sort of information we have around the sighting of such villages?",243,,
1162,0.97,6610.303,6615.442,Like is it possible to site an additional five to four villages?,243,,
1163,0.97,6615.442,6626.286,"And if so, is there sort of an idea of where given some of the funding that we have done for some of the other tiny villages?",243,,
1164,0.97,6626.286,6645.038,I'm wondering if there is any capacity concerns about just actually being able to cite them in places around the city.,243,,
1165,0.97,6645.972,6652.112,You correctly predicted that I don't have a complete answer for you on that.,244,,
1166,0.97,6652.112,6661.921,"I will say that there--you know, legislation was adopted to make it easier to site tiny home villages.",244,,
1167,0.97,6661.921,6665.859,"The estimates four to five, it is sort of--we have to make some assumptions.",244,,
1168,0.97,6665.859,6670.964,"But it could be, you know, a couple of larger villages if the sites are identified.",244,,
1169,0.97,6670.964,6678.738,But I don't have information immediately available on how--if there are actually sites already identified by the providers for this.,244,,
1170,0.97,6678.738,6682.842,But I will look into that and follow up.,244,,
1171,0.97,6682.842,6687.48,And I think this is what the Council members have been saying.,244,,
1172,0.97,6687.48,6694.821,"Whether this amendment passes or not, this money can be used for tiny home villages.",244,,
1173,0.97,6694.821,6697.29,Can I respond to that question?,245,,
1174,0.97,6697.29,6697.557,Sure.,246,,
1175,0.97,6697.557,6701.728,Let me just see if the Council President had a follow-up to that.,246,,
1176,0.97,6701.728,6705.632,"I--I probably will, but --",247,,
1177,0.97,6705.632,6707.934,Okay.,248,,
1178,0.97,6707.934,6714.808,I'm happy to hear Council member Morales' additional respond.,249,,
1179,0.97,6714.808,6719.946,When we said--Lehigh is the provider.,250,,
1180,0.97,6719.946,6722.882,They have five site that's are ready.,250,,
1181,0.97,6722.882,6732.592,Mostly in district 2 and District 4. my district would welcome the opportunity to host a couple more tiny House villages.,250,,
1182,0.97,6732.592,6738.231,"And then the other question that was asked, I think it is in Allie's document somewhere.",250,,
1183,0.97,6738.231,6745.205,"But the operating costs are about 900,000 a year.",250,,
1184,0.97,6745.205,6745.405,Yeah.,250,,
1185,0.97,6745.405,6745.872,So 4 million.,250,,
1186,0.97,6745.872,6746.106,Sorry.,250,,
1187,0.97,6746.106,6750.543,I can't read the document right now that Allie has up.,250,,
1188,0.97,6750.543,6757.884,But that information is included in the packet that we received.,250,,
1189,0.97,6757.884,6765.892,Thank you for that Council member Morales.,251,,
1190,0.97,6765.892,6775.668,I'm asking the question specifically because the city council in particular has advocated for additional funds for tiny home villages in the past.,251,,
1191,0.97,6775.668,6777.537,Which I'm supportive of.,251,,
1192,0.97,6777.537,6793.553,"And the issue is as Council member Mosqueda described, you know, we can allocate dollars but we can't force the Mayor to spend the Aproppriated dollars.",251,,
1193,0.97,6793.553,6806.8,I want to make sure that the additional funding we have heard directly from the organization that is primarily responsible or has been primarily responsible for development of tiny home villages.,251,,
1194,0.97,6806.8,6809.502,That they believe it is feasible to do so.,251,,
1195,0.97,6809.502,6816.142,I think it is important for us to get that on the record now publicly.,251,,
1196,0.97,6816.142,6838.298,"In terms of Lehigh who is a nonprofit organization who does most of the, if not exclusively the tiny home village projects for us, that they have communicated with you that they have the capacity and ability to do that and there is space somewhere in the city in order to effectuate the intent here.",251,,
1197,0.97,6838.298,6847.307,I really appreciate being able to get that information from you.,251,,
1198,0.97,6847.307,6854.214,And appreciate the effort around this potential amendment.,251,,
1199,0.97,6854.214,6870.463,I still think that I share the concern that's it works others around if we need to be this prescriptive to affect ate the intent here.,251,,
1200,0.97,6870.463,6876.869,But I'm happy to consider additional information this afternoon.,251,,
1201,0.97,6889.649,6907.834,We can signal as a priority we would like to Prioritize four or five new expanded tiny home villages but allow for use of the $3.6 million if that is not doable by a certain period of time.,252,,
1202,0.97,6907.834,6930.857,"And if the sponsors are amenable to having a conversation about how to Finesse the language a little bit to not be so prescriptive but signal there is a desire for Prioritization of those dollars, I would be interested in having those conversations off line.",252,,
1203,0.97,6930.857,6937.363,"Thank you, Council President.",253,,
1204,0.97,6937.363,6937.897,Council member Sawant.,253,,
1205,0.97,6937.897,6939.866,Thank you.,254,,
1206,0.97,6939.866,6958.117,"I just wanted to confirm that we in my office have discussed with Lehigh and they have confirmed that they have the capacity to site and make progress and, you know, get results on five tiny House villages this year.",254,,
1207,0.97,6958.117,6965.925,"And they will be able to build more capacity, Atigsal capacity this year.",254,,
1208,0.97,6965.925,6969.262,So they're not letting the grass grow under their feet.,254,,
1209,0.97,6969.262,6971.597,They're extremely on the move.,254,,
1210,0.97,6971.597,6985.078,As far as having an explicit set aside--I wouldn't call it overly prescriptive.,254,,
1211,0.97,6985.078,7006.566,"We fought for proviso to say that they would only be used for tiny House village but the proviso was amended by the Council to be the same argument that is being made here, to be less prescriptive.",254,,
1212,0.97,7006.566,7010.67,We had to learn from that experience and actually do have a set aside.,254,,
1213,0.97,7010.67,7023.983,"So if Council members are not going to be supporting this amendment, then I really hope that we can have support for the amendment that my office is bringing forward in the budget discussion.",254,,
1214,0.97,7023.983,7024.684,Thank you.,254,,
1215,0.97,7024.684,7025.051,Okay.,255,,
1216,0.97,7025.051,7025.451,Closing comments.,255,,
1217,0.97,7025.451,7028.221,We will go to the Council sponsors in a moment.,255,,
1218,0.97,7028.221,7031.391,Council member Herbold to wrap us up.,255,,
1219,0.97,7031.391,7032.258,Thank you.,256,,
1220,0.97,7032.258,7061.487,So I mentioned my support for tiny House villages as well as my reservations around a set aside if the operator was not prepared to site five tiny House villages in 2020 to have received confirmation that they both have property and--and are prepared to do this work in 2020.,256,,
1221,0.97,7061.487,7065.525,So my reservations have been satisfied.,256,,
1222,0.97,7065.525,7093.352,"But because I'm really interested in ensuring that some version of this amendment passes, I'm wondering if the sponsors would be open to pulling it and bringing it up at full council so that maybe we could address some of the other concerns of Council members and bring something forward that has a full--full support of the Council in doing so.",256,,
1223,0.97,7100.259,7101.294,"Council member Morales, you're off mute.",257,,
1224,0.97,7101.294,7105.465,Did you want to go first?,257,,
1225,0.97,7105.465,7106.799,Sure.,258,,
1226,0.97,7106.799,7112.205,I'm happy to pull this for now and dig deeper into some of the particular questions that folks have.,258,,
1227,0.97,7112.205,7142.368,I do want to echo what Council member Sawant said and Council member Gonzalez which is that we have--we are trying to be fairly Prescrippive because this Council has been very clear in the desire to see these sorts of Noncongregate shelters invested in and use as a way to get people into safer shelter.,258,,
1228,0.97,7142.368,7151.511,Not just into a more stable situation but also to make sure that they are protected from the risk of exposure.,258,,
1229,0.97,7151.511,7160.453,"And because that doesn't seem to be happening, we are trying to be really clear, again, about what this money can be used for.",258,,
1230,0.97,7160.453,7165.791,"So as I said, I'm happy to pull it for now and keep having this conversation.",258,,
1231,0.97,7165.791,7181.807,But I do want to emphasize how important it is that we find a way to ensure that it is Noncongregate shelters that we are supporting with this money and that that is what we expect the money to be spent on.,258,,
1232,0.97,7181.807,7183.009,Thank you.,258,,
1233,0.97,7183.009,7185.378,"Thank you, council member Morales.",259,,
1234,0.97,7185.378,7188.848,"Council member Lewis, did you have a comment on that as cosponsor.",259,,
1235,0.97,7188.848,7194.153,I don't have any issue waiting until Monday to Revisit this and take a look at it a little more.,260,,
1236,0.97,7194.153,7203.429,I would flag now I don't really see how it is going to change that materially between now and Monday.,260,,
1237,0.97,7203.429,7203.829,Quite frankly.,260,,
1238,0.97,7203.829,7217.61,"In the sense that--I mean, this is the set aside that is necessary to realize the operational goals of what Lehigh has said they're capable of doing in 2020.",260,,
1239,0.97,7217.61,7228.554,"I guess to add my voice to the chorus of Council members Morales, Sawant and Herbold that can verify that Lehigh is in the position to do this.",260,,
1240,0.97,7228.554,7239.565,I have been talking with Lehigh and their team on probably about a weekly basis for months where their issue has not been--has not been sites.,260,,
1241,0.97,7239.565,7264.09,Their issue has been getting some stream of money to scale up these--these places that can provide a semi permanent shelter for folks that are currently in Nonsanctioned Encampments.,260,,
1242,0.97,7264.09,7283.542,"If we made it more broad what the 3.6 million could be spent be on or reduce the amount, the effect of that is going to be that it's going to reduce our ability to get that money more ear mashed for Lehigh or whatever operator.",260,,
1243,0.97,7283.542,7293.486,That's why I'm seeing I don't see--there was a lot of Intentionility based on those goals.,260,,
1244,0.97,7293.486,7307.033,But I'm happy to wait until Monday to let this--I lot has been said about the tiny House villages.,260,,
1245,0.97,7307.033,7323.282,"But the executive and Hsd and the Mayor's office have also signaled that they support the model of the tiny House villages, certainly more than they support--have expressed support for Hoteling and other strategies.",260,,
1246,0.97,7323.282,7329.588,I really do think we could have an opportunity to move quickly on this if we had a set aside.,260,,
1247,0.97,7329.588,7335.594,I'm happy to talk about it for a few more days and maybe make the final decision on Monday.,260,,
1248,0.97,7335.594,7336.128,Wonderful.,261,,
1249,0.97,7336.128,7349.742,We know this will come back on Monday and there will be a conversation this afternoon for the budget discussions to finalize comments Council member President Gonzalez and then we will move on.,261,,
1250,0.97,7349.742,7350.543,Okay.,262,,
1251,0.97,7350.543,7353.312,Council member Sawant after that.,263,,
1252,0.97,7353.312,7354.013,Council member Gonzalez.,263,,
1253,0.97,7354.013,7355.081,Thank you.,264,,
1254,0.97,7355.081,7372.398,"Just one of the people who just expressed some soft concerns, I don't feel like I want to delay a vote on this particular amendment.",264,,
1255,0.97,7372.398,7382.408,"So, you know, if--again, I don't want to create an issue on Backtracking whether or not we take a vote on this amendment today.",264,,
1256,0.97,7382.408,7396.655,"I think--I think for those who continue to have concerns, there's always an opportunity and we can allow the amendment to move forward.",264,,
1257,0.97,7396.655,7402.261,And those who need to abstain can abstain.,264,,
1258,0.97,7402.261,7406.298,Lewis' remarks that the language is not likely to change more is probably true.,264,,
1259,0.97,7406.298,7410.069,I mean the language is very simple in the amendment.,264,,
1260,0.97,7410.069,7421.413,"It is quote at least $3.6 million of this funding shall be used to establish four or five new or expanded tiny House villages, closed quote.",264,,
1261,0.97,7421.413,7441.734,I think the issue that I was flagging and I will say it probably more directly now and would be interested in hearing from either of the cosponsors in response to this is what happens when--and I'm going to say when not if.,264,,
1262,0.97,7441.734,7459.351,What happens when the Mayor refuses to spend $3.6 million of the Covid relief jump start appropriations?,264,,
1263,0.97,7459.351,7473.265,So what happens to our overall effort around Deintensification of congregate shelter if the Mayor refuses or when the Mayor refuses to spend $3.6 million?,264,,
1264,0.97,7473.265,7481.307,And so I just want to make sure that we have a clear answer to that.,264,,
1265,0.97,7481.307,7505.331,Because what--what I want to avoid is having $3.6 million not spent because of a potential refusal to not spend those dollars because we have been prescriptive about it.,264,,
1266,0.97,7505.331,7506.298,That is my honest concern.,264,,
1267,0.97,7506.298,7514.94,And I just want to sort of get a better understanding of sort of what our paths are if and when that occurs.,264,,
1268,0.97,7514.94,7517.51,I will let the Council sponsors speak to that.,265,,
1269,0.97,7517.51,7525.351,"I will NOTE if this is pulled today, we have suggestive language pulled from the coalition.",265,,
1270,0.97,7525.351,7534.393,There is possibility that that language could be Massaged and seem amenable by the sponsors of the amendment prior to Monday.,265,,
1271,0.97,7534.393,7534.66,Okay.,266,,
1272,0.97,7534.66,7540.332,Let's have them answer the question real quick.,267,,
1273,0.97,7540.332,7540.599,Yeah.,268,,
1274,0.97,7540.599,7540.9,Thank you.,268,,
1275,0.97,7540.9,7543.168,"Council President, I totally understand what you're saying.",268,,
1276,0.97,7543.168,7554.013,We know that this is in fact the pattern that we've had regarding this particular kind of homeless response.,268,,
1277,0.97,7554.013,7557.349,"But that risk is there for this entire proposal, right.",268,,
1278,0.97,7557.349,7566.091,Everything that we're trying to do right now risks the Mayor not actually spending the money on it.,268,,
1279,0.97,7566.091,7571.997,"Like I said, I--I agree that there's probably not a lot we can do with this language.",268,,
1280,0.97,7571.997,7577.636,I'm happy to look at what was sent this morning.,268,,
1281,0.97,7577.636,7583.876,I haven't seen it.,268,,
1282,0.97,7583.876,7584.243,Candidly.,268,,
1283,0.97,7584.243,7592.318,"But, you know, if we want to review that and come back to it on Monday, I'm happy to do that.",268,,
1284,0.97,7592.318,7594.887,I'm leave it there.,268,,
1285,0.97,7594.887,7595.354,Thank you.,269,,
1286,0.97,7595.354,7597.756,"Council member Sawant, I saw your hand up.",269,,
1287,0.97,7597.756,7599.391,"Council member Lewis, did you have a response.",269,,
1288,0.97,7599.391,7619.411,"I was going to say really briefly, the only other thing that I would add is, you know, actually of the Deintensification strategies, most enthusiasm has been for tiny House villages, more than Hoteling and the other opportunities.",270,,
1289,0.97,7619.411,7626.652,I don't know exactly that hostility on this point is inevitable necessarily.,270,,
1290,0.97,7626.652,7636.495,"Although, you know, all of the other concerns that Council members Gonzalez and Morales raised about general uncertainty around jump start, sure.",270,,
1291,0.97,7636.495,7650.743,"But, you know, just from my conversations with the Mayor's office and Hsd, I don't know that there is Overhostility to this type of Deintensification strategy.",270,,
1292,0.97,7650.743,7656.382,So I would just say I don't know that there will be inevitable conflict on that point.,270,,
1293,0.97,7659.985,7661.92,Okay.,271,,
1294,0.97,7661.92,7662.221,Thank you.,271,,
1295,0.97,7662.221,7663.889,Council member Sawant.,271,,
1296,0.97,7663.889,7664.79,Thank you.,272,,
1297,0.97,7664.79,7684.81,I think Council member Morales made a good point that in reality the Mayor's office or any of the city departments if there was not actually a movement of ordinary people pushing for results that have been promised could fail to do any of the things that we are saying as a Council.,272,,
1298,0.97,7684.81,7688.08,So I think given--and I'm going to repeat myself here.,272,,
1299,0.97,7688.08,7711.036,"Given the past experience with the Mayor having shown her inability or unwillingness to actually allocate the funds for tiny House village that's the city Council has intended for tiny House villages, I think it is important to have specific language on that, whether it is this amendment or an amendment from my office that passes.",272,,
1300,0.97,7711.036,7720.813,But the intent of either amendment is that we actually push towards holding the Mayor's office accountable to funding tiny House villages.,272,,
1301,0.97,7720.813,7725.384,"I think that is the main component, actually making that happen.",272,,
1302,0.97,7725.384,7732.691,And if the sponsors of this amendment decide to withdraw--I have already declared support for it.,272,,
1303,0.97,7732.691,7736.161,"If you move it forward, I will be voting yes on it.",272,,
1304,0.97,7736.161,7753.278,If you decide to withdraw t I wanted to urge you to cosponsor the amendment from my office so that together we can make sure that the intent of actually providing this direction for tiny House villages is obtained through the budget discussion and the budget vote.,272,,
1305,0.97,7753.278,7753.545,Okay.,273,,
1306,0.97,7753.545,7756.482,That is all of the questions that I saw.,274,,
1307,0.97,7756.482,7761.587,And it has been moved and Seconded.,274,,
1308,0.97,7761.587,7764.223,It is the sponsor's Purview what you want to do this morning.,274,,
1309,0.97,7764.223,7767.426,I think I would like to go ahead and call the question.,275,,
1310,0.97,7767.426,7774.133,And we can continue to have conversation and make some changes on Monday if that seems necessary.,275,,
1311,0.97,7774.133,7779.938,But I think it would be important for us to go ahead and take a vote.,275,,
1312,0.97,7779.938,7780.439,All right.,276,,
1313,0.97,7780.439,7782.808,Thank you for your directness there.,277,,
1314,0.97,7782.808,7785.144,We will call the question then.,277,,
1315,0.97,7785.144,7787.579,Council colleagues appreciate the feedback.,277,,
1316,0.97,7787.579,7792.151,"And, again, we will have an opportunity to continue conversations on this on Monday.",277,,
1317,0.97,7792.151,7805.03,I want to make sure that folks know that this conversation should be reflective of support for Noncongregate shelters including tiny House villages.,277,,
1318,0.97,7805.03,7807.966,The question is about a specific dollar set aside.,277,,
1319,0.97,7807.966,7811.537,"During the time of Covid, we need 24/7 shelter options.",277,,
1320,0.97,7811.537,7814.373,That is not what is currently provided by the administration.,277,,
1321,0.97,7814.373,7818.143,It is not a healthy place to be in congregate settings.,277,,
1322,0.97,7818.143,7823.382,We know we have about 500 people currently in congregate shelters still.,277,,
1323,0.97,7823.382,7835.427,And tiny House villages along with individual rooms as was identified in the letter we received from Community partners are much better than the current situation.,277,,
1324,0.97,7835.427,7845.637,So I don't want anyone to Conflate this conversation or discussion to not be supportive of tiny houses when I think all of our records stand firm about supporting tiny houses in the past.,277,,
1325,0.97,7845.637,7850.209,"With that, as the amendment currently stands, led call the roll.",277,,
1326,0.97,7850.209,7858.75,Recognizing there could be potential language even further amended by Monday if it gets adapted.,277,,
1327,0.97,7858.75,7860.452,Madam clerk.,277,,
1328,0.97,7860.452,7861.22,Juarez.,278,,

1347,0.97,7896.188,7898.29,Okay.,297,,
1348,0.97,7898.29,7898.59,Wonderful.,297,,
1349,0.97,7898.59,7902.16,So the amendment is Adoptedment congratulation Council members Morales and Lewis.,297,,
1350,0.97,7902.16,7904.029,Thank you for your work on this.,297,,
1351,0.97,7904.029,7906.131,I believe there are follow-up questions that people may have.,297,,
1352,0.97,7906.131,7911.77,As it stands we have this language adopted in the Council bill currently amended.,297,,
1353,0.97,7911.77,7917.109,Thank you for all of your work and the Stakeholders who are written in.,297,,
1354,0.97,7917.109,7917.809,We appreciate it.,297,,

1381,0.97,8063.755,8070.028,"We know roughly 9,000 eligible small businesses applied for the funding during the initial round.",303,,
1382,0.97,8070.028,8077.302,Unfortunately our--this bill and our previous work could only provide enough funding for about 1300 of them.,303,,

1389,0.97,8113.939,8117.476,We want to make sure that we're being responsive to the urgent needs.,304,,
1390,0.97,8117.476,8130.755,"I support increasing the pot of money for some of these small businesses, especially given that so few of the applicants for the city small business assistance in the first round were actually funded.",304,,
1391,0.97,8130.755,8139.764,"Reading a story yesterday on the potential 20% of restaurants and small business that's are going to be out of business soon, I can see why this amendment is needed.",304,,

1396,0.97,8161.853,8174.065,"I am of course supportive of expanding the resources available to small businesses, including small business that's are nonprofit businesses.",305,,
1397,0.97,8174.065,8185.677,But I am really concerned about continuing to dive into our city's emergency fund balances.,305,,
1398,0.97,8185.677,8194.052,We are with our jump start spending plan already using a lot of those dollars.,305,,
1399,0.97,8194.052,8204.996,We have heard from director--budget director Ben noble about the need to be able to access some of those dollars in 2021.,305,,
1400,0.97,8204.996,8214.973,And a number of us are members of the labor relations policy committee.,305,,
1401,0.97,8214.973,8241.266,"And we are hearing some dire predictions for 2021 as it relates to layoffs, Furloughs, and the need to explore other options to address what are going to be really intense I think Covid-19 2021 budget impacts.",305,,
1402,0.97,8241.266,8255.88,And so I appreciate the sponsor Council member Strauss Referenced a plan to pay the emergency fund balances back.,305,,
1403,0.97,8255.88,8269.728,"But without understanding what that plan might be, I can't support the further reduction of those fund sources prior to 2021.",305,,
1404,0.97,8269.728,8271.963,Thank you.,305,,
1405,0.97,8271.963,8275.133,Thank you Council member Herbold.,306,,
1406,0.97,8275.133,8276.635,Council President Gonzalez.,306,,
1407,0.97,8276.635,8278.67,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",307,,
1408,0.97,8278.67,8291.116,"I in addition to the concerns expressed by Council member Herbold, I am also Unfortunately not able to support this amendment at this time.",307,,
1409,0.97,8291.116,8304.262,"I was really glad to work with Council member Strauss' office to lift the eligible cap in amendment 1 which was built into, you know, the base there.",307,,
1410,0.97,8304.262,8313.938,And Ideally recognizing that this cap eligible cap will allow the additional flexibility to capture more small businesses without opening up eligible too much.,307,,
1411,0.97,8313.938,8338.53,I think in his effort overall it is important that we stay focused on the small businesses in need of help without unintentionally making mom and pop places when we think of small businesses compete with businesses that have back offices that handle payroll and have the capacity to a Ply for the apply for the grants.,307,,
1412,0.97,8338.53,8344.569,"We need a mixed strategy to help small businesses, cash grants and are a start.",307,,
1413,0.97,8344.569,8348.506,And it may be a lifeline for some of the small businesses.,307,,
1414,0.97,8348.506,8381.005,"But, you know, I think that again in addition to the fiscal policy concerns expressed by Council member Herbold, another one of the concerns that I have about this particular amendment is that there--there isn't a clear set of language around racial equity and how to center equity in the disbursement of the cash assistance.",307,,
1415,0.97,8381.005,8395.153,"And I have heard that the office of economic development, there is concern whether they can fulfill the scale of what they're being proposed to do through this additional $9 million.",307,,
1416,0.97,8395.153,8411.236,"So I think, you know, it is important for us to recognize that this cash assistance program can be similar or analogous to what we sue in the Federal Government's Ppp program.",307,,
1417,0.97,8411.236,8418.643,That Federal Government Ppp program offered us lessons in how it is important to provide an equity lenses in small business support.,307,,
1418,0.97,8418.643,8430.688,"You know, businesses that had relationships to big banks in the Federal program did very well in the application process.",307,,
1419,0.97,8430.688,8438.029,Unsurprisingly we saw there was a huge amount of racial disparities in who was able to apply and get awards and not awarded.,307,,
1420,0.97,8438.029,8452.811,"And so we know through the Federal program, again, which I see as sort of an analogous effort, minority and women owned businesses were shut out of the Federal program.",307,,
1421,0.97,8452.811,8457.315,I don't want Seattle to have a similar story or anything close to that.,307,,
1422,0.97,8457.315,8467.625,So I still have a few questions about sort of what we're doing through this amendment.,307,,
1423,0.97,8467.625,8474.532,Some of the questions is what will be the fiscal impact of using additional Reserve funds.,307,,
1424,0.97,8474.532,8487.579,"Coups member Herbold has highlighted taking from the Reserve funds and it could have devastating impacts on the need to access those dollars to avoid Furloughs, for example.",307,,
1425,0.97,8487.579,8493.751,What is the capacity of the office of economic development to ensure timely delivery of grants.,307,,
1426,0.97,8493.751,8499.123,With the initial round of small business stabilization grants.,307,,
1427,0.97,8499.123,8508.633,What is the capacity to do this through a lens that does not leave businesses with barriers like language behind.,307,,
1428,0.97,8508.633,8516.774,And Lastly now Howe can we ensure that what happened with the Federal Ppp grants do not happen in our efforts here in the city of Seattle.,307,,
1429,0.97,8516.774,8533.524,"So, again, I think that the funding that we have available now for Oed my understanding is that they're ready to sort of accept herd the shepherd those dollars.",307,,
1430,0.97,8533.524,8538.029,We will make sure that there is a mechanism forgetting the funds to where they need to go.,307,,
1431,0.97,8538.029,8548.373,But I also think that it is important to allow Oed an opportunity to get the program right.,307,,
1432,0.97,8548.373,8568.893,And I think the original size will stand the greatest chance of allowing Oed success in being able to the program before we scale up to the level that would be required if this amendment were to pass.,307,,
1433,0.97,8568.893,8573.798,"So based on that, I'm likely not going to support this amendment at this juncture.",307,,
1434,0.97,8573.798,8586.878,That doesn't mean that I don't support the overall effort to continue to look at these economic stimulus opportunities for our smallest businesses.,307,,
1435,0.97,8586.878,8593.318,"And we did so through some of the work that was included in amendment 1. new, chair.",307,,
1436,0.97,8593.318,8596.721,Thank you Madam President.,308,,
1437,0.97,8596.721,8597.255,Any additional comments?,308,,
1438,0.97,8597.255,8597.522,Okay.,309,,
1439,0.97,8597.522,8603.227,"Council member Strauss, did you have any additional comments or you had alluded to another amendment.",309,,
1440,0.97,8603.227,8609.601,I will defer to you to sort of wrap up the comments on this conversation on amendment 3.,309,,
1441,0.97,8609.601,8611.302,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",310,,
1442,0.97,8611.302,8636.728,"I did have another amendment that I could bring forward that would require the rules to be suspended because of not distributed it which would Disburse the $9 million, 5.6 million would be allocated to small businesses and an even disbursement to all other support tore immigrant refugee, child care support, food services.",310,,
1443,0.97,8636.728,8643.201,What I'm hearing is there is more of a concern about running down all of our emergency funding.,310,,
1444,0.97,8643.201,8652.977,And I think that Council President's comments about making sure that there is an equitable distribution of these funds is very important.,310,,
1445,0.97,8652.977,8676.501,"And so if this amendment does not pass, I will likely bring forward another amendment on Monday that just brings forward $5.6 million into the small business stabilization fund to make that 25% of the overall spending and bring forward an additional equitable distribution language as well.",310,,
1446,0.97,8676.501,8676.801,Okay.,311,,
1447,0.97,8676.801,8678.202,"Thank you very much, council member Strauss.",311,,

1493,0.97,8801.058,8803.427,Would you like to speak to it?,338,,

1496,0.97,8810.168,8811.202,I move to consider amendment 4.,339,,
1497,0.97,8811.202,8812.236,Is there a second.,340,,
1498,0.97,8812.236,8815.64,It has been moved and Seconded.,341,,
1499,0.97,8815.64,8819.443,Council member Strauss as sponsor of this amendment you can recognize this amendment.,342,,
1500,0.97,8819.443,8819.844,Thank you.,343,,
1501,0.97,8819.844,8826.217,"In line with my previous amendment, I have spoken to so many small businesses across my community.",343,,
1502,0.97,8826.217,8835.626,And there have been a range of issues from rental assistance to stabilization funds to requesting VNO relief.,343,,
1503,0.97,8835.626,8849.574,One of the reasons that I brought from the stabilization fund is most businesses came back to me stating that having a pool of money that they could choose where it was used was most helpful.,343,,
1504,0.97,8849.574,8863.621,"And so with regard to small--hearing from small businesses about the VNO taxes, I continue to hear this is one of their biggest problems especially during the crisis because it is levied based on gross revenue rather than profit.",343,,
1505,0.97,8863.621,8875.633,"While BNO taxes is a separate issue, this amendment would consider additional small business support in the form of relief from BNO taxes for certain small businesses.",343,,
1506,0.97,8875.633,8883.307,This does have an impact on our future city revenue which is why further discussion and analysis is needed.,343,,
1507,0.97,8883.307,8889.947,This is simply stating that we would--that Council intends to consider additional support through BNO relief.,343,,
1508,0.97,8889.947,8897.154,There are still a lot of requesters that need to be answered if we go down this path such as who would receive the relief and how much.,343,,
1509,0.97,8897.154,8902.927,I believe it is important that we consider these questions during the rebalancing discussions.,343,,
1510,0.97,8902.927,8903.527,"Thank you, chair.",343,,
1511,0.97,8903.527,8905.329,"Thank you, council member Strauss.",344,,

1515,0.97,8908.566,8911.002,"Thank you so much, Madam chair.",345,,
1516,0.97,8911.002,8914.438,I real Loo want to thank Council member Strauss for coming forward with this.,345,,
1517,0.97,8914.438,8917.408,I'm proud to support this amendment.,345,,
1518,0.97,8917.408,8945.77,"I really do think that, you know, when we talk about our Regressive tax system and I would count the way that we assess BNO tax as having Regressive implications on a lot of small businesses in the city, I think it is important that we talk about relief in some cases in addition to seeking higher taxes on people who can afford to pay more, like our highest earning corporations or wealthy individuals.",345,,
1519,0.97,8945.77,8949.273,We need to look to find ways to reduce Regressive taxes.,345,,
1520,0.97,8949.273,8960.885,"We as a city don't have a lot of tools, for example, to get our sleeves rolled back and roll back sales tax or rebate sales tax since the collection of centralized with the state.",345,,
1521,0.97,8960.885,8981.105,"Bno is something where we could really provide targeted relief and get around the prohibition on gift of public funds because we are Rebating back taxes instead of giving a--you know, giving a gift of public funds, we can rebate taxes and it is a way that we can provide directory leave.",345,,
1522,0.97,8981.105,8998.856,Certainly interested in looking at ways we do this where we can build an equity into who is receiving the relief that we can make sure that is truly affecting small businesses and not big ones.,345,,
1523,0.97,8998.856,9007.465,This is a way to get money back in the hands of small business owners that we know is suffering throughout the city right now throughout this crisis.,345,,
1524,0.97,9007.465,9013.337,And I look forward to continuing to work on this and to vote in favor of this today.,345,,
1525,0.97,9013.337,9019.744,"Thank you, council member Lewis.",346,,
1526,0.97,9019.744,9020.444,Any additional comments?,346,,
1527,0.97,9020.444,9021.178,Council President Gonzalez.,346,,
1528,0.97,9021.178,9023.748,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",347,,
1529,0.97,9023.748,9027.585,I am going to support this particular amendment.,347,,
1530,0.97,9027.585,9030.154,I want to thank Council member Strauss for bringing it forward.,347,,
1531,0.97,9030.154,9043.567,I think the amendment recognizes the need for flexibility and looks at some level of relief in the business and occupation tax area for small businesses.,347,,
1532,0.97,9043.567,9047.605,Of course there are a lot of remaining questions.,347,,
1533,0.97,9047.605,9049.673,Council member Strauss recognized what those would be.,347,,
1534,0.97,9049.673,9058.749,"First and foremost, what the reduction--any potential reduction in taxes as opposed to complete abatement of tax liability.",347,,
1535,0.97,9058.749,9069.66,But what a reduction of tax obligation would be on the overall revenue picture for the city of Seattle.,347,,
1536,0.97,9069.66,9081.172,Obviously that is an important threshold question as we head into ongoing budget deficits as a result of the economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.,347,,
1537,0.97,9081.172,9112.336,So we have to be very thoughtful and careful about making sure that we have a good impact will be . of what the the other thing that we have heard that I would be interested in pursuing is the opportunity to look at not necessarily reduction only strategies in this space but what it would look like to have deferred payment of BNO tax liability.,347,,
1538,0.97,9112.336,9137.228,We've heard directly from some small bids that moving due dates further out as was recently done on the payment of BNO was helpful and helped businesses both fulfill their business and occupation tax liability while also adapting their business model to continue to have income revenue coming in the door to stay--to stay open.,347,,
1539,0.97,9137.228,9145.536,So I think there's an opportunity to have some sort of mixture of relief here that could be reduction in some instances.,347,,
1540,0.97,9145.536,9155.946,But in other instances could just be deferral of the tax liability without impact to the full amount of tax liability.,347,,
1541,0.97,9155.946,9191.182,So I just want to signal my support of this overall concept but my ongoing interest in intent in pursuing some other possibilities through the intent language that is included in amendment 4. and want to confirm with Allie after saying all of that that the Languagein amendment 4 is broad enough to allow the kind of scope of work that I've described to actually occur.,347,,
1542,0.97,9191.182,9208.566,"And if it is not broad enough, to allow for that work to occur, would be happy to have Offline conversations with Council member Strauss about potential friendly amendment for us to consider on Monday.",347,,
1543,0.97,9208.566,9208.933,Wonderful.,348,,
1544,0.97,9208.933,9209.233,Thank you.,348,,
1545,0.97,9209.233,9211.302,I saw Council member Sawant.,348,,
1546,0.97,9211.302,9213.571,Can I get an store that question.,349,,
1547,0.97,9213.571,9218.209,I'm so sorry Council member President.,350,,
1548,0.97,9218.209,9220.544,Does the central staff have an answer to that.,350,,
1549,0.97,9220.544,9220.878,Thank you.,351,,
1550,0.97,9220.878,9222.78,"Yes, I think it is broad enough.",351,,
1551,0.97,9222.78,9231.689,And I imagine that this is likely work that your central staff will be working on.,351,,
1552,0.97,9231.689,9240.631,"This wouldn't limit you to explore in one specific strategy of how we sort of reduce the tax obligation, the burden, that sort of thing.",351,,
1553,0.97,9240.631,9246.67,I don't think it is necessary in particular because it would be your own staff likely working on this.,351,,
1554,0.97,9246.67,9248.172,So I have noted it down.,351,,
1555,0.97,9248.172,9255.112,And I'm happy to talk more about changing the language.,351,,
1556,0.97,9255.112,9259.083,But I think it addresses--it can address a variety of options.,351,,
1557,0.97,9259.083,9271.061,We will always come with different ways that you could try to achieve your goals when we're trying to help you address a certain concern or policy goal.,351,,
1558,0.97,9271.061,9271.729,"Thank you, Allie.",352,,
1559,0.97,9271.729,9272.73,"Thank you, chair.",352,,
1560,0.97,9272.73,9275.265,Thank you Madam President.,353,,
1561,0.97,9275.265,9276.233,"Council member Sawant, go ahead.",353,,
1562,0.97,9276.233,9293.784,I just wanted to clarify to the members of the public and the movement that might be watching that my office will be supporting this amendment because its intent is to--it is stating counsel's intent to lower BNO taxes for small businesses in the future.,354,,
1563,0.97,9293.784,9314.238,"I want to clarify that that is why we are supporting this, because we don't support lowering taxes of any kind, including the Tacks on big businesses in which case if we had taxes only on big businesses they would be overwhelmingly Progressive.",354,,
1564,0.97,9314.238,9319.777,This is making it clear that it is reducing the tax burdens on small businesses.,354,,
1565,0.97,9319.777,9321.612,I will be voting yes.,354,,
1566,0.97,9321.612,9322.813,Wonderful.,355,,
1567,0.97,9322.813,9325.149,Council member Morales.,355,,

1569,0.97,9325.516,9326.116,I'll be brief.,356,,
1570,0.97,9326.116,9333.223,I just want to express my support for this and thank Council member Strauss for raising the issue.,356,,
1571,0.97,9333.223,9340.964,I know this is a long standing Council memo Brian was looking at how to adjust this BNO tax a couple years ago.,356,,
1572,0.97,9340.964,9347.504,My office started asking questions of central staff in January.,356,,
1573,0.97,9347.504,9357.114,So I'm eager to support this and look forward to working with you on whatever ends up moving forward here.,356,,
1574,0.97,9357.114,9357.414,Thank you.,356,,
1575,0.97,9357.414,9357.748,Wonderful.,357,,

1579,0.97,9366.156,9366.39,No.,358,,
1580,0.97,9366.39,9368.792,"Just thank you, everyone, for your consideration.",358,,
1581,0.97,9368.792,9377.668,We do know that the smallest businesses here in our city will--may and will need BNO relief.,358,,
1582,0.97,9377.668,9381.371,And we need to take this into consideration as we move forward.,358,,
1583,0.97,9381.371,9382.172,"Thank you, chair.",358,,
1584,0.97,9382.172,9382.639,All right.,359,,

1587,0.97,9386.009,9391.882,Let's also remember there was a statement of legislative intent that was submitted last year.,359,,
1588,0.97,9391.882,9396.153,It is due back in September to explore changes to the BNO tax structure.,359,,
1589,0.97,9396.153,9399.923,I think that will be a nice compliment to this.,359,,
1590,0.97,9399.923,9410.467,Looking forward to working but all and the sponsor of this amendment to implement the recommendations to frankly create a more progressive tax structure.,359,,

1683,0.97,9791.815,9798.522,The counsel's intent to adopt a resolution outlining these spending.,402,,
1684,0.97,9798.522,9817.407,"The resolution is introduced was developed using the details that were originally included in that spending plan ordinance on June 22 that proposed investments in housing, economic revitalization and the equitable development initiative and additional details.",402,,
1685,0.97,9817.407,9823.38,These details are described on page 3 and 4 of the staff memo and I will briefly describe them here.,402,,
1686,0.97,9823.38,9851.575,"In the housing and services Úcategory, changes included adding specific green building requirements for the proposed investments in and allocating 10% of the funds in that category for a community acquisition development and program support fund to further fair housing and address past discriminatory policies and practices.",402,,
1687,0.97,9851.575,9863.253,"It specifies that investments in businesses, workforce development and business districts will provide--Transitioning to a new profession.",402,,
1688,0.97,9863.253,9868.124,And it includes a change that was--excuse me.,402,,
1689,0.97,9868.124,9881.204,Sponsored by Council member Pedersen to include nonprofit organizations and then language to Prioritize the investments in businesses for marginalized communities.,402,,
1690,0.97,9881.204,9884.007,And to provide economic displacement.,402,,
1691,0.97,9884.007,9893.35,"In addition, the resolution as introduced as a specific allocation of the funds to implement the strategies called for in the green new deal resolution.",402,,
1692,0.97,9893.35,9899.723,"And then with that, I will turn it back to the chair.",402,,
1693,0.97,9899.723,9900.123,Okay.,403,,
1694,0.97,9900.123,9904.861,First I want to say thank you to all of our Council colleagues.,403,,
1695,0.97,9904.861,9912.202,You've had a tremendous impact on the language that was introduced here in this resolution.,403,,
1696,0.97,9912.202,9913.837,The bill is originally introduced.,403,,
1697,0.97,9913.837,9919.676,It was converted to a high level spend plan that corresponded with the revenue proposal that we passed.,403,,
1698,0.97,9919.676,9927.584,"Based on that base proposed bill, we are reintroducing this resolution with tremendous feedback from owl of our Council members here.",403,,
1699,0.97,9927.584,9936.526,I want to spend a quick second to see if anyone wants to highlight the incredible amendments in this bill.,403,,
1700,0.97,9936.526,9942.766,Sometimes we don't get a chance to underscore the important and incredible work that has gone into the base bill.,403,,
1701,0.97,9942.766,9950.373,So is there any individual who would like to speak to some of the amendment language that they have included in this resolution in front of us?,403,,
1702,0.97,9950.373,9955.645,I'm sorry I'm using the terms bill and resolution Interchangely.,403,,
1703,0.97,9955.645,9960.684,This is a resolution just so folks in the viewing audience know.,403,,
1704,0.97,9965.522,9973.563,I'll just say I've been doing a work on the equitable initiative and I will talk about that later.,404,,
1705,0.97,9973.563,9974.097,Okay.,405,,
1706,0.97,9974.097,9974.397,Excellent.,405,,
1707,0.97,9974.397,9978.101,Any more comments on the underlying bill that you want to highlight.,405,,
1708,0.97,9978.101,9978.968,Council member Herbold.,406,,
1709,0.97,9978.968,9985.275,Are we just talking right now about the comments --,407,,
1710,0.97,9985.275,9986.443,The resolution as introduced.,408,,
1711,0.97,9986.443,9997.887,Before we get into comments so folks know all of the work that you all did to make significant improvements to the resolution text before we get into the discussion about amendments.,408,,
1712,0.97,9997.887,10001.591,"If you have anything that you want to highlight for the viewing public, feel free.",408,,
1713,0.97,10001.591,10008.698,It is a question about the substitute as opposed to what you were inviting for people who contributed to the substitute.,409,,
1714,0.97,10008.698,10011.201,You can ask a question as well.,410,,
1715,0.97,10011.201,10011.701,Please feel free.,410,,
1716,0.97,10011.701,10016.406,Just trying to follow your directions.,411,,
1717,0.97,10016.406,10025.982,So I have a question about the funding included for the office of housing.,411,,
1718,0.97,10025.982,10038.461,I understand that the office of housing doesn't currently have funding for funding support and capacity for organizations to pivot programming to acquisition and development.,411,,
1719,0.97,10038.461,10048.972,But we've heard from Puget sound Sage advocating for these dollars to be allocated to Edi for that same purpose instead.,411,,
1720,0.97,10048.972,10063.086,And I recognize that the Edi program hasn't traditionally focused on the housing element of a project that might include housing.,411,,
1721,0.97,10063.086,10087.11,"But in my experience working on projects that--that anticipate both Oh funding as well as Edi funding, part of the problem I think historically for getting the Oh funding is that the office of housing sometimes has a different vision for how to Prioritize their housing dollars.",411,,
1722,0.97,10087.11,10102.592,I think it is a totally appropriate approach that is often focused on trying to maximize housing acquisition and development.,411,,
1723,0.97,10102.592,10115.572,Whereas the Edi has been focused historically on addressing the needs associated with addressing--addressing displacement.,411,,
1724,0.97,10115.572,10124.347,Sometimes that involves projects that include housing but maybe not the same large number of units of housing.,411,,
1725,0.97,10124.347,10139.162,And so I just have concerns about--about putting these dollars in Oh rather than putting them in the Edi specifically for housing within Edi.,411,,
1726,0.97,10139.162,10146.369,"I'm going to let you take that question and Allie as we do so, the black box is up again on the screen.",412,,
1727,0.97,10146.369,10149.205,"If you could Reload, that would be great.",412,,
1728,0.97,10149.205,10151.207,"Tracy, go ahead.",412,,
1729,0.97,10151.207,10156.045,So this potential funding for--I think we call it program support.,413,,
1730,0.97,10156.045,10175.064,"The vision here would be that as some of those funds from the community Fund are allocated to specific projects, that Oh would be able to make an allocation to the specific sponsors of that housing to shore up to be beef up their capacity to actually get that project to the finish line.",413,,
1731,0.97,10175.064,10180.036,And you are correct in that Oh has not really had those resources before.,413,,
1732,0.97,10180.036,10190.146,We actually used to--years ago we used to have an organizational support funding that we provided to actually many nonprofit housing providers.,413,,
1733,0.97,10190.146,10194.25,We would give it to the providers as they were building up the organizational capacity.,413,,
1734,0.97,10194.25,10196.586,That money went away long ago.,413,,
1735,0.97,10196.586,10208.598,"It has been recognized for in particular some of the housing development groups coming in, community based ones that some of the support, that kind of funding for the support is really necessary.",413,,
1736,0.97,10240.73,10268.358,"It is a policy choice as you have mentioned but in the years that the Edi has been a Grantmaking program, focused on the Non-Housing components, the funding so much for the acute is in this resolution says that they can be both for the housing and Non-Housing component.",414,,
1737,0.97,10268.358,10276.666,"You know, this particular fund is similar to but it is focused on housing investment must specifically.",414,,
1738,0.97,10276.666,10305.395,"I would just note that there is an amendment, amendment two to the resolution that tries to tie it more tightly so there is coordination and consultation with the equitable development initiative team in the us of of planning and community development as well as working with the advisory, the Edi advisory board to inform those investment areas or investment decisions, excuse me.",414,,
1739,0.97,10305.395,10312.001,"Thank you so much, thank you Councilmember and we look forward to that discussion as well.",415,,
1740,0.97,10312.001,10322.445,Will be happy to highlight some of the conversations we have had with organizations like these to ask for additional Edi participation in the funding process and selection process.,415,,
1741,0.97,10322.445,10327.95,That is a great preview of the process to come.,415,,
1742,0.97,10327.95,10329.018,"Okay, not seeing additional comments.",415,,
1743,0.97,10329.018,10333.623,Want to thank folks for all of their input on this draft resolution that we have in front of us.,415,,
1744,0.97,10333.623,10340.363,And I'm going to ask central staff to go one by one through the amendments.,415,,
1745,0.97,10340.363,10350.073,"So with that, if you could please present them on amendment one and then explained by introducing them and then I will explain, too.",415,,
1746,0.97,10350.073,10350.673,Thank you.,416,,
1747,0.97,10350.673,10355.178,Amendment one.,416,,
1748,0.97,10355.178,10369.992,Sponsored by chair mosquito would add a recital for the city's commitment to advocating work with other public and private housing Funders to modify the policies to support the development of housing with advanced screening and standards.,416,,
1749,0.97,10369.992,10376.833,This recognizes the requirements included in this resolution that any new housing is meeting those labor standards and has enhanced green building standards.,416,,
1750,0.97,10376.833,10387.009,"But if that increases the cost of development, it may be difficult for those projects to compete for funding that could help leverage the city's investments.",416,,
1751,0.97,10387.009,10397.82,This is a commitment that the city will continue to work with those Funders to ensure that these projects will be committed.,416,,
1752,0.97,10397.82,10399.021,"Thank you very much, Allie.",417,,
1753,0.97,10399.021,10403.926,I moved to amend resolution 31957 as presented on amendment one on the agenda.,417,,
1754,0.97,10403.926,10409.866,Is there a second?,417,,

1761,0.97,10431.354,10431.954,You all reached out.,419,,
1762,0.97,10431.954,10448.371,"We know the single most important thing that we can do to combat these changes to invest in affordable housing and transit jobs and services, because as more people get displaced from the city, one of the biggest actually--the biggest Emitters of carbon emission is commuting into the city.",419,,
1763,0.97,10448.371,10458.381,We are creating situations where people are having to commute hours in and we are the third largest city in the nation to have a big meter status.,419,,
1764,0.97,10458.381,10462.185,Meaning that more and more workers and community members are getting pushed further and further out of the city.,419,,
1765,0.97,10462.185,10498.12,"We are really excited that this proposal and the underlying bill and the resolutions that we are talking about--sorry, the language were talking about today--emphasized funding for retrofitting updating green affordable housing and working with him at activists, labor activists, we have now included language in here they can be really directed at trying to build additional affordable housing with green standards, using strong labor standards and moving into us a new fossil free world.",419,,
1766,0.97,10498.12,10503.826,"We know that we include a labor Standings together, the return on investment is much higher in terms of economic resilience for workers.",419,,
1767,0.97,10503.826,10530.887,"This is a benefit that sometimes comes with added cost to building the actual housing and we want to make sure that we are able to access and leverage all funding options to build projects to the green standard needs and then as we Buid the additional cost, that it is not sort of used as a penalty against outside developers for what they're doing to include labor standards and rebuilding standards.",419,,
1768,0.97,10530.887,10548.938,So this amendment acknowledges that the city has an opportunity to work with the public and private partners to align housing funding priorities to support these benefits to our communities and really excited about the partnership that we have had working with the building developers and some nonprofit building developers.,419,,
1769,0.97,10548.938,10555.845,Labor advocates and environment of justice advocates as we drive to the cemetery as well.,419,,
1770,0.97,10555.845,10563.252,Looking forward to your support so we can create more high- performing buildings that are able to compete for financing and meet our housing and green standards.,419,,
