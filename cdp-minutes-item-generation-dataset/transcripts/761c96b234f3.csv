582,0.97,4966.861,4972.701,"The most Evicting landlord in 2019 was Goodman real estate, a corporation with $2.5 million worth of property holdings in the U.S. and Canada.",162,,
583,0.97,4972.701,4993.822,"Other major a victors include regional giant epic asset management and national landlord corner management corporation, the American civil liberties Union found that nationally 90% of landlords are represented in Eviction court, but only 10% of tenants are.",162,,
584,0.97,4993.822,5006.234,"Can you imagine, as a struggling tenant facing Eviction, perhaps because you just lost your low-wage job, going up against the likes of attorneys from Goodman real estate?",162,,
585,0.97,5006.234,5012.741,Our right to counsel legislation will give these tenants at least a fighting chance in court when I have to go up against these greedy corporate landlords and their greedy lawyers.,162,,
586,0.97,5012.741,5017.712,"The impact from the right to counsel as we have seen in cities around the country that have passed similar legislation, is absolutely astounding.",162,,
587,0.97,5017.712,5025.754,"With a lawyer, far fewer people are evicted.",162,,
588,0.97,5025.754,5034.462,This is because unjust Evictions are overturned in court and it is because Eviction defense attorneys can and do help connect people with social services when they are needed.,162,,
589,0.97,5034.462,5048.81,"Housing justice project in Seattle, for example, works closely with Homebase, which administers rental assistance funds so they can help people pay back rent and present back to a judge to prevent the Eviction.",162,,
590,0.97,5048.81,5058.887,"Statistically, even for people who are ultimately evicted, having an attorney still improves the outcomes with Renters saddled with less crushing debts.",162,,
591,0.97,5058.887,5061.089,But all of this is not the end of the story.,162,,
592,0.97,5061.089,5072.267,"It is also because, when there is a universal right for Renters to have a trained attorney with them in court, that gives corporate landlords pause from issuing Eviction notices in the first place.",162,,
593,0.97,5072.267,5089.517,"In New York, the rate of Eviction filings dropped by a stunning 30% since the right to counsel legislation passed, because landlords know they can no longer use the courts to bully Renters who have no legal help . They're going to go up against a trained attorney.",162,,
594,0.97,5089.517,5111.039,"These are all the primary reasons to support the right to counsel, because of human impact of Evictions on Renters and the progressive outcome overall for our society by refusing housing instability and homelessness, not to mention the racial component of this, giving universal right to counsel is a black lives matter issue.",162,,
595,0.97,5111.039,5114.709,"But even through the narrow lens of the city proper finances, the right to counsel is sensible.",162,,
596,0.97,5114.709,5135.597,"Housing justice project, for example, is estimated at guaranteeing the right to counsel will cost approximately $750,000 in a normal year, by a normal year, I mean an, a normal year without Eviction moratorium.",162,,
597,0.97,5137.532,5154.649,I appreciate the Cosponsorship and I urge all Councilmembers to support this legislation without watering it down with loan--one loophole or another.,162,,
598,0.97,5154.649,5163.191,Thank you.,162,,
599,0.97,5163.191,5192.487,"Thank you member Sawant, we are going to consider several amendments, my suggestion is that we debate and vote on each amendment before we make comments on the legislation as a whole, if that is acceptable for you folks, I would like to proceed in that manner.",163,,
600,0.97,5192.487,5210.738,"And then, counsel for Sawant as a sponsor of the bill, you will have last, the last word as is required under the Council rules, you will have the last word on the bill before we close out, in closing the debate, you will have the last word on the bill, just want to sort of say that up front.",163,,
601,0.97,5210.738,5217.445,"As is customary, let's go ahead and deal with the amendments, if that is okay with you.",163,,
602,0.97,5217.445,5220.415,"Okay, I'm getting a head nod, I'm going to go ahead and go.",163,,
603,0.97,5220.415,5239.968,"First up, let's go ahead and do them in order of the number of amendments listed on the agenda, so that means the first amendment is amendment one, which is advanced by Councilmember Herbold, I'm going to hand it over to make her motion.",163,,

608,0.97,5262.39,5266.394,"To amend the bill as presented on amendment one, Councilmember Herbold, you are recognized in order to address amendment one.",166,,
609,0.97,5266.394,5282.076,"Think is much, this amendment would specify that an attorney organization with, that the Department of constructions and inspections would contract with, that that organization should have experience providing legal representation to tenants.",167,,
610,0.97,5282.076,5302.73,"This amendment was suggested by an advocate who has deep experience working with tenants in the city of Seattle in this individual experience, they wrote that the many legal aid organizations that might just provide advice about notices or on the other hand, might only represent tenants and some very narrow circumstances.",167,,
611,0.97,5302.73,5324.352,"This bill isn't a funding mechanism, but it is important that the Council include in our intention that this bill for future funding that would support this policy be made available only to those organizations willing to represent tenants in a courtroom in the broad circumstances that this bill contemplates.",167,,

643,0.97,5421.449,5443.337,"This is an amendment regarding future reporting obligations, and, the amendment would require the organization with whom the city contracts will provide reporting on numbers of cases for representation that occurs outside of the initial appearance show cause hearing.",191,,
644,0.97,5443.337,5456.951,"Most cases, vast majority of cases are resolved at the initial appearance or hearing, in fact, the last year for which we have data in 2018, only 11 cases of a total of nearly 9000 cases actually went to trial.",191,,
645,0.97,5456.951,5505.933,"We know that we had some really important and Transformational statewide and local Eviction law reforms, and it is quite possible, given that those reforms inherently give tenants, and largely tenants who are subject to Eviction for nonpayment Upfront, gives them a basis to oppose their Eviction in court for the first time, so, it is possible that there have been larger numbers of cases that are actually going to trial, rather than being resolved in this initial hearing, in cases that go to trial, they're going to take more resources in order to continue the funding of this really important right to counsel policy.",191,,
646,0.97,5505.933,5530.925,"So, this amendment would require that the providers providing the service include this information as a report, as required by the contract, and inform the Council in the future about whether further legislative changes need to be made to address any issues that could be brought on by a future increase in the need for representation throughout the period of a longer trial.",191,,

669,0.97,5608.903,5655.449,"As I mentioned this morning, I was interested in pursuing an amendment that accomplished two things, one, that made the bill legally defensible, and a more workable bill, that would actually bring to fruition the right to counsel to those tenants who need it the most, and secondarily, I have a strong interest in supporting this policy and ensuring access to legal aid for those tenants who need it the most, so, my office pursued this particular amendment, which accomplishes a few simple things.",209,,
670,0.97,5655.449,5679.373,"So, first of all, this bill as a recital to acknowledge that the Council's intent to minimize, the Council has an intent to minimize as many barriers as possible, second, amendment three establishes that any tenant residing in Seattle has the right to legal counsel free of charge if attended needs a simple Indigency standard.",209,,
671,0.97,5679.373,5688.916,This standard is modeled on the same standard utilized in the immigrant legal defense fund unanimously adopted by city council in 2016.,209,,
672,0.97,5688.916,5705.032,The definition of Indigency focuses on the inability to afford an attorney at any point during an unlawful Detainer lawsuit.,209,,
673,0.97,5705.032,5709.336,"Third, this amendment allows the contract of legal service Providersto establish the process and manner by which to verify Indigency.",209,,
674,0.97,5709.336,5722.65,This is a common practice similar to the steps taken by service providers in other circumstances such as the self certification process approved in the Covid-19 Eviction defense bill last year.,209,,
675,0.97,5722.65,5768.963,"The tenant simply needs to sign a form at their appearance in Eviction court that could be a simple thing as saying as I cannot afford an attorney and then signing that form and being therefore immediately eligible for receiving free legal aid, so, we are not talking about a process by which by which a tenant is going to have to present a mountain full of paperwork in order to prove that they are indigent, it is as simple as the process that we currently have in place for legal defense, which is a self Attestation or certification that you, indeed, cannot pay for your own attorney in this unlawful Detainer action.",209,,
676,0.97,5768.963,5818.712,"I believe this is very simple, I believe that most individuals who need the access to legal aid are going to be able to easily, simply, and in collaboration with service providers who have a strong interest in providing legal services to those individuals, is going to be able to accomplish the Council's underlying policy goals, making sure we have access to legal aid, so, again, I believe this language is going to minimize the risks of having this loss survive a legal challenge, which I believe is almost going to certainly happen.",209,,
677,0.97,5818.712,5821.415,While also providing access to a right to counsel to those that need it.,209,,
678,0.97,5821.415,5853.08,"This amendment, again, is a reminder, is modeled after the immigrant legal defense fund that the city council unanimously passed in 2016. in that case, we also included an indigent standard, again, in the three years of existence, the defense fund has helped hundreds of immigrants and refugees fighting deportation proceedings while having no administrative burden or effect on those seeking services as a result of the indigent Standard and the self certification process I that context, again, this was unanimously supported.",209,,
679,0.97,5853.08,5868.596,"So, I would, today, ask for your support in voting in favor of amendment three.",209,,
680,0.97,5870.264,5875.502,"All right, we have some comments here, we are going to open up the floor, first up is Council member Herbold followed by Councilmember Morales.",209,,

682,0.97,5878.405,5884.278,You are ready to go.,209,,
683,0.97,5884.278,5891.218,"Thank you, Council President Gonzales, for bringing forth this amendment to make this bill stronger this amendment is not an example of means testing.",210,,
684,0.97,5891.218,5900.16,"Legal services Dividers can simply ask Renters to sign a statement that they are eligible for this service, and after doing so, they are immediately entitled to representation.",210,,
685,0.97,5900.16,5907.401,There is no test for anyone to have to produce documents and wait for the test to be graded.,210,,
686,0.97,5907.401,5908.435,It is not means testing.,210,,
687,0.97,5908.435,5925.452,Means testing is a method for determining whether someone qualifies for financial assistance to obtain a service or good and it looks at the means or monetary resources that that individual has available to them to pay for a particular service or good.,210,,
688,0.97,5925.452,5934.962,Then it determines the person's access to financial assistance is based on their ability to pay for it.,210,,
689,0.97,5934.962,5936.63,"Again, this amendment does not require means testing.",210,,
690,0.97,5936.63,5940.567,This amendment will make the right stronger for eligible Renters.,210,,
691,0.97,5940.567,5950.844,Stronger to resist legal challenge from those who do not Wantanyone to have the right.,210,,
692,0.97,5950.844,5956.517,Just one person receiving a free attorney when they have sufficient funds to pay for an attorney could bring the hard earned right to counsel law down.,210,,
693,0.97,5956.517,5960.788,I do not want to take that risk.,210,,
694,0.97,5960.788,5969.129,This amendment ensures that the greatest number and those most in need are eligible to receive assistance when facing Eviction with the most minimal of requirements.,210,,
695,0.97,5969.129,5979.073,"I have seen data that means testing can be a barrier to services, I have not seen any data that is self Attestation of poverty is a barrier to services.",210,,
696,0.97,5979.073,5998.993,No one is catering to big landlords or creating loopholes to reduce the number of people who have access to the right to counsel that this policy serves.,210,,
697,0.97,5998.993,6000.394,Nor are we watering anything down.,210,,
698,0.97,6000.394,6010.738,"They're trying to pass a bill to ensure that tenants can remain housed when they are unaware of their rights or don't have the resources to stand up for the rights, that is why it is so important that we ensure this legislation can stand up to legal challenges.",210,,
699,0.97,6010.738,6011.939,Thank you.,210,,
700,0.97,6011.939,6013.407,"Thank you, counsel for Herbold.",211,,
701,0.97,6013.407,6018.345,Council member Morales is next and then Council member Sawant.,211,,
702,0.97,6018.345,6056.984,"I don't have much more to add than what Councilmember Herbold said, it is the case that right now, legal service providers already asked a similar question about one possibility to pay, and this amendment doesn't add requirements for detailed income information, it is simply Quantifying what is happening in practice, and leaves to the providers decisions about how to set parameters for how to determine that, so, I don't think that it creates any additional barrier, it just Codifies some of the things already happening, and I intend to support this amendment.",212,,
703,0.97,6056.984,6057.184,Due.,212,,
704,0.97,6057.184,6065.492,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",213,,
705,0.97,6065.492,6078.939,I oppose this amendment to insert means testing or any other kind of requirement for people to have to qualify for the right to counsel.,214,,
706,0.97,6078.939,6087.414,I believe the right to counsel should be universally available for those who need it.,214,,
707,0.97,6087.414,6093.087,Just because it has been a standard used in a previous legislation is not a good enough reason to reproduce it in this legislation.,214,,
708,0.97,6093.087,6097.624,"Councilmembers may want to call it happy joy testing if you want, it is still means testing.",214,,
709,0.97,6097.624,6105.732,"It is asking people to go through some kind of hoop, jump through some kind of hoop before they qualify.",214,,
710,0.97,6105.732,6115.008,People should be able to have universal rights . I also do not agree with the idea that this amendment makes the legislation quote Unquote legally defensible.,214,,
711,0.97,6115.008,6124.017,Eviction defense attorneys themselves have made it very clear that such amendments are not needed to make this legislation legally defensible.,214,,
712,0.97,6124.017,6146.373,"At the end of the day, which makes any law passed strong, progressive law, passed strong against legal challenges by corporations, the wealthy, corporate landlords, is a fighting United movement of working people, Renters, and anyone who wants to have and live in affordable and just city.",214,,
713,0.97,6146.373,6151.478,"The right to have a lawyer to prevent Eviction should be available for every Renter facing Eviction, just like all the best public services.",214,,
714,0.97,6151.478,6160.187,"That is no means tested to use the public rooms, they are available for everyone.",214,,
715,0.97,6160.187,6180.974,"There is no means test for public education or the fire Department, there is no means testing to use the lights, the Streetlights, federally, social security is available to everyone, and because of that, has endured for 86 years, almost a century, despite repeated attempts to dismantle it by the ruling class, both Republican and Democratic administrations.",214,,
716,0.97,6180.974,6184.578,"Because these crucial public services or not means tested, nobody is shamed or humiliated for using them.",214,,
717,0.97,6184.578,6197.791,"Across the spectrum of social services, any means testing, even the least Invasive aspects or types, has the effect of preventing some of the most vulnerable people from using the service.",214,,

764,0.97,6783.777,6799.058,Thank you very much Council President.,219,,
765,0.97,6799.058,6800.927,I first want to thank Council member Sawant for bringing this forward.,219,,
766,0.97,6800.927,6808.034,This is the first time we've had a chance to talk about this legislation and was looking forward to voting on it a few weeks ago and I'm glad this is moving forward today so thank you for bringing this forward.,219,,
767,0.97,6808.034,6812.138,I know cities across the country are looking to do similar things so I appreciate the work that got into this legislation.,219,,
768,0.97,6812.138,6820.246,The outrage that has been expressed about means testing is absolutely right.,219,,
769,0.97,6820.246,6835.728,I have spent a long time fighting against means testing in the state Legislature especially when I work to implement health especially health for kids about a dozen years ago.,219,,
770,0.97,6835.728,6850.877,At that point the testing was being weapon iced to prevent immigrant kids to be added to the roles for eligibility for apple health at the time and that's why have and continue to fight against means testing.,219,,
771,0.97,6850.877,6866.993,I think it's important to me to have understood the discussion today and the briefing from the Council President on this amendment in the context of the immigrant legal defense fund ordinance that it was based off of.,219,,
772,0.97,6866.993,6876.836,"As I understand this amendment in front of us, the legal organization accept self Attestation simply saying an individual can simply say they don't have the means to afford an attorney.",219,,
773,0.97,6876.836,6914.941,"I know a lot of folks struggling right now, many people out of work or still trying to pay their own rent and child care and the concept of having to pay an attorney on top of that, a lot of people will say they can't afford an attorney so someone is itself attesting that they can't afford an attorney meets the criteria here that the organization is not going to ask for income verification, not going to look at any monetary resources and not comply with a test of any kind.",219,,
774,0.97,6915.074,6930.623,"I think this is a big distinction from the types of means testing I fought in the past, self Attestation is what we fought for in many cases as an alternative to means testing so people can get the services they are eligible for and in this case, that we've determined, a right to.",219,,
775,0.97,6930.623,6983.509,"I appreciate that there is clarification that there's no documentation required at the time of application or later and as I checked in with a hint and full of legal assistance folks across the city are currently helping and have previously helped, they noted that this is really important because it's been a long- standing approval process by including Federal entities like the legal services corporation to avoid undermining Attorney- client privilege and that's relationship to make sure they just accept from the client at the point of service that they are not able to pay for an attorney that any additional type of barrier would be a barrier to the intake and could not be a functional process so they are very much opposed to means testing but have been working under this existing model of self Attestation and believe that it is not an additional barrier.",219,,
776,0.97,6983.509,7007.567,"I understand the standard is not a test now on application later and that is very important that I wanted to put out there because just like I think means testing can have a chilling effect on whether or not someone applies for services, I also don't want there to be any confusion out there of when this bill passes, I don't want there to be any confusion out there about folks coming and signing up.",219,,
777,0.97,7007.567,7026.719,There's no test and at the very least it sounds like there will be a piece of paper that's signed and we want to make sure folks get access to the services and I don't want there to be a chilling effect from debate but ultimately this legislation will pass and I look forward to supporting the final legislation and I will be supporting this amendment today.,219,,
778,0.97,7026.719,7034.627,Are there any other comments on amendment 3? Councilmember Lewis?,220,,
779,0.97,7034.627,7045.972,"Thank you Madam President, I couldn't figure out how to do the Digital raise hand today for some reason so I did it the old-fashioned way, so thank you for recognizing me for a moment.",221,,
780,0.97,7045.972,7061.087,"I will be supporting the amendment today, my colleagues have already made a lot of the comments that I would have but I want to emphasize a few more that I think are instructive and important.",221,,
781,0.97,7061.087,7113.272,"I want to add that another distinction between the self Attestation and means testing is that this will not incur procedural costs since we are not doing financial screenings and investigations into people's financial background to do a self Attestation which I think is a critical thing to note that means testing and one of the big arguments in addition to what we've already discussed here today on the impact it can have on people seeking services, the deterrent the effects can have on people seeking services it also would have incurred real cost to the city in buying the software for half million dollars, hiring and Ftd at a cost of over $100,000.",221,,
782,0.97,7113.272,7140.566,A model of self Attestation does not do that and can kick in Procedurally at the point when people will need this legal assistance and will not require a delay or a rescheduling of these tenant related Eviction proceedings.,221,,
783,0.97,7140.566,7146.739,So it doesn't come with those logistical and financial costs that means testing would have come with in addition to all the other horrible things about means testing we have already discussed extensively in this session.,221,,
784,0.97,7146.739,7161.954,I also want to acknowledge my appreciation for Council President Gonzales and bringing forward a proposal that is structured to provide the very minimum of potential hurdle while addressing the very real substantive impacts.,221,,
785,0.97,7161.954,7223.449,"I don't want to violate the fight Club rules of executive session but I will just say all of us were in that executive session and I think it is important that we center the guidance and advice of the team that successfully defeated vigorous legal actions against just cause Eviction, against first in time protections and against the various Eviction moratoriums this counsel has enacted and I believe, I appreciate Council President's diligence in working with the team in working with us on the Council to craft something that will still provide this vital service to everyone who will need it while at the same time strengthening this law against the challenges that we know will come from Deep-Pocketed and very well Resourced landlord interest that will suit to try to get rid of it.",221,,
786,0.97,7223.449,7233.259,"So with that, Madam President I don't have any additional comments and I appreciate your leadership and bringing this forward.",221,,
787,0.97,7233.259,7233.96,Thank you.,222,,
788,0.97,7233.96,7240.132,Are there any additional comments on amendment 3?,222,,
789,0.97,7240.132,7246.372,"Okay, Councilmember Sawant?",223,,
790,0.97,7246.372,7250.543,"Thank you, I wanted to specifically address the question of self Attestation.",224,,
791,0.97,7250.543,7258.684,I don't agree that it will not be a value because that's not what the data indicates it all.,224,,
792,0.97,7258.684,7270.396,"For example, according to Seattle official enrollment number for the program which is for low income people who cannot afford to pay the full utility bills.",224,,
793,0.97,7270.396,7293.219,"As of enrollment numbers as of the end of February is 42,094 customers and they are currently estimating the number of eligible households at 90,000 so that mean Seattle's Ute utility discount program has enrolled less than 50 percent of the eligible households.",224,,
794,0.97,7293.219,7301.727,"It used to be even worse than that, it used to be under 20 percent.",224,,
795,0.97,7301.727,7355.815,"The city now also Enrolls people who live in Seattle housing authority and other Low- income housing and this was part of our effort from our movement to opt out program but there was not enough so now the application process has been made simpler which of course I support making any obstacle simpler but now there's a simple self certification so people can self certify their income but still the enrollment remains at less than 50 percent years later and there are many other examples but I chose this one because it is close to ours, right here in the city of Seattle so when the evidence does not show that self Attestation will not be a barrier I don't know how Councilmember can give claim that it won't be a barrier because it will.",224,,
796,0.97,7355.815,7356.115,Thank you.,224,,
797,0.97,7356.115,7372.098,"Are there any additional comments or questions on amendment 3? because on the sponsor I get the last word on it, so just last call on amendment 3. Okay, I'm going to make some closing remarks.",225,,
798,0.97,7372.098,7392.184,I want to thank you all for the conversation and the debate amount amendment 3 and your work consideration of adopting a minute 3. there's a few things I want to clarify in response to some of Councilmember Sawant's comments on amendment 3 that I do think are not entirely accurate.,225,,
799,0.97,7392.184,7443.335,"One, I do not believe that lawyers representing tenants are going to Humiliate tenants as a result of the passage of amendment . There were some comments made that somehow a self Attestation was going to result in humiliation but let's remember that the people who are asking the questions about eligibility and Accessing legal services are the very people we are relying on to represent those individuals and I believe that they are going to put forward consistent with their current process, something that is compassionate, not embarrassing and that will fulfill their mission of making sure that as many tenants as possible have access to free legal services when needed during Eviction proceedings.",225,,
800,0.97,7443.335,7457.349,"Second, there's been a creation of comparisons between access to water, light, and roadways to legal aid services that pay for a lawyer and I believe this is a false equivalency and should be rejected for that reason.",225,,
801,0.97,7457.349,7458.751,"Third, this is not a means test.",225,,
802,0.97,7458.751,7465.758,"We have a constitutional obligation to not engage in the gift of public funds, the supplies to every single action and determination and decision we make as a city council.",225,,
803,0.97,7465.758,7490.683,"That obligation flows again from the Washington state Constitution . I believe amendment 3 focuses our limited resources on those who most need access to free legal services and Eviction proceedings and I believe even with the inclusion of amendment 3, those individuals who need representation for free and Eviction proceedings, will in fact be able to receive those services.",225,,
804,0.97,7490.683,7526.552,"Fourth, there's been a lot of remarks by Councilmember Sawant about this setting a precedent that would not otherwise be set if we pass the base bill without amendment 3. however, only an amendment to the Washington state's Constitution would allow for the state Legislature to avoid the realities of the duties related to the gift of public funds, in other words is obligation related to avoiding the gift of public funds applies equally to the Washington state Legislature as it does to us.",225,,
805,0.97,7526.552,7546.739,"There is no such effort at the state to amend the Constitution to allow for a different standard related to how we allocate an appropriate taxpayer dollars at the local, regional, or state efforts.",225,,
806,0.97,7546.739,7572.498,That is exactly why Senate bill 5160 which is specifically designed to address the Eviction cliff that we are all facing includes Indigency requirement to create a statewide right to counsel and Lastly there's been an analogy created between the Indigency standard that we are about to consider adopting in amendment 3 to the provisions provided in the utility discount program.,225,,
807,0.97,7572.498,7582.775,A simple Google of utility discount programs Seattle request enrollment brings up the enrollment form that an individual would have to fill out in order to determine whether or not they are eligible.,225,,
808,0.97,7582.775,7593.218,"Unlike the program, my amendment is not include the disclosure of what is expected or estimated monthly income for your household before taxes.",225,,
809,0.97,7593.218,7606.799,In fact if you look at the eligibility enrollment form there is a question that requires disclosure of the expected or monthly income before taxes.,225,,
810,0.97,7606.799,7619.044,"That requirement is not included in amendment 3, only a self Attestation that you cannot afford an attorney will be asked in order to determine legal eligibility under this particular program.",225,,
811,0.97,7619.044,7660.386,"There is not a clean comparison between the Udp, it certainly requires much more than a self certification and Attestation of not being able to afford for example in that case paying your bill . So I will close out debate there, and appreciate your consideration of adopting amendment 3 and I'm excited about voting on this bill to finally one and for all create a right to counsel for tenants in the city of Seattle and look forward to doing that very soon here.",225,,
812,0.97,7660.386,7666.892,"With that, will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of amendment 3?",225,,

820,0.97,7737.896,7738.764,I will be brief.,231,,
821,0.97,7738.764,7761.487,This amendment and never 4 on today's agenda would advise one of the recitals in the bill to clarify that the executive Department should conduct an open request for proposal process for awarding this tax dollars rather than making a direct award to a single attorney organization without an open process.,231,,
822,0.97,7761.487,7781.373,This amendment will provide a grace period of a year and a half to continue with existing contract and the request for proposal process would occur and that Comports with best practices and awarding ongoing contracts to provide additional opportunities to attorney organizations which could include the existing one as well as others that you would like consideration for providing these legal services.,231,,
823,0.97,7781.373,7782.774,Thank you.,231,,

826,0.97,7797.89,7812.104,I was trying to make sure that no one is surprised by my votes so I want to give a chance to let others know that I did have a chance to check in with Councilmember Pederson and I apologize that I did not some of the questions this morning.,233,,
827,0.97,7812.104,7849.241,"I am not in favor of this amendment simply because I think it might be more in the weeds the necessary . I think well it's advisory, they clearly can take it under advisement but it's not directing them and I feel like it is not necessary given what I understand is that they go through a process where there are fees on a fairly regular basis and also think there is a level of urgency around the relation, the trust relation that hopefully a contracting entity would have with referral entities or with folks who work with those who might need services.",233,,
828,0.97,7849.241,7864.957,I appreciate where you're coming from with this because I do think it's important for those contracts to go out but I understand that they already had something similar in the works and I'm going to be voting no on this today but I appreciate the intent from where you came from.,233,,
829,0.97,7864.957,7868.193,Council member Sawant?,234,,
830,0.97,7868.193,7893.118,"Thank you, I will be voting no on this amendment, it's just an amendment so does not change the substance of the legislation however in voting no because it's overly prescriptive of how the Department of construction and inspections contracts out the services and does not reflect the reality of Eviction code in Seattle.",235,,
831,0.97,7893.118,7921.313,"In the bill that my office has proposed, it says that the Seattle Department of construction inspection which is the city Department responsible for enforcing rights . Our bill then gives parameters for what makes an organization a good choice to provide these services.",235,,
832,0.97,7921.313,7927.252,"We want attorneys with experience defending Renters in court against Eviction, we want an organization that works out of the King County courthouse so Renter can be met by an attorney when they show up.",235,,
833,0.97,7927.252,7947.372,The reality is the housing justice project is the only organization like that right now in Seattle and as they themselves will tell you there are not many private forms or any at all perhaps and very few around the country that provide this kind of service which is defending Renters against Eviction.,235,,
834,0.97,7947.372,7968.56,The justice attorneys are dedicated and they do the best they can to support Renters and that's why this clause they propose States that Sdci should continue contracting with as JP unless an other organization becomes better qualified.,235,,
835,0.97,7968.56,7996.021,"We recognize that we do not know who will be defending Renters in 10 years, 20 years, maybe it will be some organization or Sjp, the Department is empowered by the legislation to make that decision, we do not require that they require sap, but we acknowledge the role they are playing right now.",235,,
836,0.97,7996.021,8010.635,"None of this needs to be prescribed in the legislation, I want to stress again that because this amendment changes a closet does not change any functional part of the legislation but I do think it's unnecessary and overly prescriptive.",235,,
837,0.97,8010.635,8012.204,"Thank you, Councilman Herbold?",236,,
838,0.97,8012.204,8039.564,"I think the language in the existing recital about a future organization potentially becoming a qualified, I don't know what other way a department would have to make that determination if it was not for an open competitive process to determine who is most qualified.",237,,
839,0.97,8039.564,8060.685,Given that this is only a recital and it's only providing the councils policy preference and given that it's important to Councilmember Pederson and that I would hope that with this amendment we could get his support for the bill.,237,,
840,0.97,8065.857,8076.802,Let's not focus on where differences are let's focus on where we have agreement.,237,,
841,0.97,8076.802,8079.404,"For all those reasons I would definitely support the recital as proposed, thank you.",237,,
842,0.97,8079.404,8109.835,"Any other comments on amendment 4? I will hand it back to cancel the Pederson in a minute but I intend to Úsupport this amendment as well for many of the reasons stated by Councilmember Herbold, I don't think it creates a different rubric.",238,,

855,0.97,8197.722,8230.922,"I would think the Council president for her leadership on this to help us and give us more time and her sensitive amendment that passed today to enact laws strong enough to survive scrutiny so we can actually help our most vulnerable neighbors, policymakers sometimes need the time to think through the various ramifications and because you took the time in this case, we are were able to consider approve sizable minutes to make this legislation better so I am able to update my vote to a yes.",244,,

862,0.97,8254.646,8259.251,I want to reiterate I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation to bring all tenants representation in Eviction cases and really appreciate today's discussion.,246,,
863,0.97,8259.251,8278.303,It's true that any Renter could face Eviction and any tenant should know they have support during one of the hardest times in their life and that support should not be contingent on public health emergency or any other limitations.,246,,
864,0.97,8278.303,8282.407,We know that prior to the pandemic tenants were already facing tough odds in Eviction court if they didn't have legal representation.,246,,
865,0.97,8282.407,8297.656,As Eviction moratorium I lifted across the region and the public emergency is in our Rearview mirror we know many of our neighbors will be in tough situations again.,246,,
866,0.97,8297.656,8313.471,"At the moment, those lucky enough to know about programs like the housing justice project or the tenant La center know that legal representation can be the difference between remaining Houston and creating a plan to have to live in your car and folks should not have to feel lucky to access limited free legal representation.",246,,
867,0.97,8313.471,8332.657,"As I said before, the Landlord- tenant relationship is unbalanced and the right to counsel goes a long way toward providing tenants with protection and putting them on equal footing with landlords and I'm proud to sponsor this legislation.",246,,
868,0.97,8332.657,8333.458,Thank you.,246,,

872,0.97,8347.972,8429.721,"I'm happy to hear your comments as well along with what Councilmember Herbold said, I want us strive for anonymity and collaborative work on counsel and I'm very excited to be able to support this legislation today including with the amendments that were passed today and I think it puts us on more solid legal ground and I think there's a tremendous amount to celebrate as Seattle is going to be looked at as a national leader in this issue, I was trying to look up the Statistics to remind myself but on this morning's news I heard that around 20 percent of Renters are still struggling to be able to pay rent and the cliff for windows Eviction moratoriums go away is real and threatening and we are working very hard to make sure that Renters have dollars in hand and I want to reiterate a rental assistance bill that we are considering next week is also a small landlord assistance bill because it passes through and it's part of that support network that goes to our smallest landlords who are also being impacted by the consequences of Covid so I see it as a both, and conversation, today's bill is truly something to be celebrated and for us to continue to reiterate that if you are facing Eviction you have a right to counsel and we can say that with incredible pride in the city of Seattle.",248,,
873,0.97,8429.721,8437.662,Thank you all for all of your amendment you brought forward today to make this legislation stronger and thanks to Councilmember Sawant and Morales and Lewis who were the original cosponsors as well.,248,,
874,0.97,8437.662,8459.617,"I'm looking forward to passing it and showing unanimity across counsel for our United support and to do that not just for Renters who are facing Eviction but truly to provide a more stable, local economy as we recover.",248,,
875,0.97,8459.617,8476.634,We cannot create a more equitable or stable economy if people continue to fall into homelessness and this is quite literally at the foundation and economic stimulus for our local economy as well as a humanitarian piece of let legislation to make sure people have access to housing and prevent them from falling into homelessness.,248,,
876,0.97,8476.634,8482.807,Very excited to support this and thank you all for your work on it.,248,,

878,0.97,8483.908,8537.729,"Hi just want to ground and some quick facts from the losing home report that was commissioned out of my office in collaboration with the Seattle women's Commission, the Northwest justice project and Washington km, and some of the findings include that nearly 52 percent of tenants in Eviction filings were people of color, 31.2 percent were black tenants and this is in Eviction rate of 4.5 times what would be expected based on their demographics in Seattle and women were more likely to be evicted over small amounts of money, of single tenant households where a tenant owed $100 or less, 81 percent of those being evicted were women.",250,,
879,0.97,8537.729,8566.19,"Tenants face steep financial cost resulting from an Eviction, the median court that judgment was over $3000 including rent owed, Nonprint charges and legal costs and nearly 86 percent of Eviction filings were for nonpayment of rent and of these, 52 percent were for one month or less in rent.",250,,
880,0.97,8566.19,8577.602,"Tenants were required to pay Ttorneys fees, 91 percent of cases with the median charge of about $416 and court costs, 92 percent of cases with a median charge of about $360.",250,,
881,0.97,8577.602,8636.527,"Those Stats are really focused on not just the basis for why we need changes to the election law both in state law and in our own local law in Eviction cases that are related to nonpayment of rent, now tenants have more of a right to make an argument about the conditions that lead to nonpayment of rent cases but in order to make these arguments to address these really heartbreaking findings from the losing home report, tenants need to have Eviction prevention, legal provides advice from Tate trained attorneys in order to make the arguments that for the application of the new rights they have since 2019S changes in the state Legislature and city law as well.",250,,
882,0.97,8636.527,8666.758,"Just wanting to bring it back to the inequities that we see in our Eviction court system and we can't just always work on improving the laws and the rights, but we have to also address people's ability to stand up for them and I want to thank Council member Sawant and all of the tenant advocacy advocacy groups who have made that Cal loud and clear.",250,,
883,0.97,8666.758,8676.834,,251,,
884,0.97,8678.87,8728.82,"I will just make a couple of additional remarks to build on what my colleagues have already said, for me, a big thing that was instructed early on to sign on as a co-sponsor . 86 percent of the people who were represented in a proceeding avoided an Eviction suggests to me in the way that our Eviction system is set up in the law around Evictions in the courts and how these hearings are conducted and traditional expectation of who does and does not have representation in those proceedings has led to thousands, hundreds of thousands nationally of illegal Evictions.",252,,
885,0.97,8728.82,8759.05,"That when you have counsel in the courtroom and an advocate that can stand to address the merits of the case that your landlord is bringing, tenants overwhelmingly have been able to stand up and hopefully this will have a deterrent in the courtroom for tenants becomes well-known on meritorious elections will no longer be tolerated in Seattle and King County.",252,,
886,0.97,8759.05,8800.892,This legislation could end up having a really profound impact and certainly has in other parts of the country and I really look forward to the impact that we are going to see in our neighbors who are tenants being able to live with a sense of security in reducing the number of our neighbors who fall into a state of homelessness and end up living in Encampments and in vehicles and I really look forward to the next phase in making sure we have sufficient appropriation to sustain and build on this going forward in a city that is majority Renter and make sure that this is well enforced.,252,,

891,0.97,8849.44,8851.375,Thank you so much.,255,,
892,0.97,8851.375,8921.812,I don't see any other hands raised . I also wanted to say thanks for an opportunity to consider this legislation in spite of our disagreement as it relates to amendment 3. I still think this is the right policy Úfor the city . I have long advocated for expansion and establishing legal aid programs and a lot of other areas and have in fact been very supportive of the prime sponsors and other efforts to add additional resources for the Express purpose of legal aid and prevention of Evictions in our community and I think that need related to Evictions and the need to have access to a lawyer is that much more important in this period of time where we know we are facing a synonymy of Evictions after the moratoriums or lifted but before people are able to get back on good footing economically to be able to catch up on their rent.,255,,
893,0.97,8921.812,8940.364,This counsel has taken important steps on other tenant protections that I think we are all proud of and appreciate the opportunity to have a bill that will be able to be implemented quickly and that will be legally defensible in a court of law.,255,,
894,0.97,8940.364,8948.172,I'm going to handed over to Sawant for closing remarks and then we will call the roll on this bill.,255,,
895,0.97,8948.172,8964.488,"Thank you, I'm very happy from the comments that Council members have made that this bill is likely to pass unanimously . with this legislation, Seattle's about become the first city in Washington state that guarantees the right to counsel for Renters facing Eviction.",256,,
896,0.97,8964.488,8980.905,This victory belongs to the mentors right and Socialist movement which my counsel office is proud to be a part of and which understands that it takes a fighting strategy to overcome corporate landlords and politicians.,256,,
897,0.97,8980.905,8994.018,"Seattle now joins New York, San Francisco, boulder, Colorado, Newark, New Jersey, Baltimore, Maryland, among others in Prescribing legal rights for Renters facing Eviction.",256,,
898,0.97,8994.018,9035.659,"Hundreds of community members in many community organizations deserve credit for this victory, particularly the Seattle tenants Union, Socialist alternative, the book workers Union, the housing justice project, the American civil liberties Union, the Washington state affiliate and the National ACLU real change transit riders Union and many others including the dozens of activists and virtually all of home are struggling workers and Renters who collected 460 exhibitors from working people in our city who strongly support this legislation.",256,,
899,0.97,9035.659,9039.03,For the last seven years and counsel office has served as the center of organizing for the Renters rights movement.,256,,
900,0.97,9039.03,9053.177,"We have built powerful movements, fought for and brought legislation like the law that bans rent increases in buildings were code violations exist in the ban on winter Evictions, a cap on moving fees.",256,,
901,0.97,9053.177,9070.194,"We did all of this through collaboration and unity among ordinary people, workers, Rank- And-File members, community organizations and individual community members who have no power or influence by themselves become strong when we organize together and fight back.",256,,
902,0.97,9070.194,9079.603,We have one unanimous votes repeatedly by fighting back is a movement.,256,,
903,0.97,9079.603,9091.115,We celebrate this victory but we cannot become complacent because we know that the status quo is still heavily stacked against Renters and in favor of corporate landlords.,256,,
904,0.97,9091.115,9135.793,"Landlords have immense power and in many cases, power over whether people can afford to remain housed . that is why we still need a huge expansion of social housing by public revenues that text big business so we need to increase the Amazon tax, we need to make sure that Renters rights themselves or continue to be strengthened and that's where my office and the growing Renters rights movement will not rest after today's passage of right to counsel, our movement will claim today's victory as a victory for the grassroots movement and will go forward to advance legislation to protect Renters from default Evictions.",256,,
905,0.97,9135.793,9159.483,"Half of all Evictions in Seattle happen by default meaning the court automatically asked the Renter because they did not fill out the paperwork to request a hearing or did not attend the hearing and often its most vulnerable Renters affected by default . We have heard horror stories of people who are bedridden or were in a Coma or have Dementia, being evicted by default without even knowing it's happening.",256,,
906,0.97,9159.483,9167.758,My office is already working on a moratorium of Evictions of schoolchildren and their families during the months of the school year as was suggested by school board member.,256,,
907,0.97,9167.758,9187.011,We have also been working on legislation requiring landlords to have to meet a just cause standard for all Evictions by closing the current loophole that allows them to Evict tenants without cause and we are preparing to develop legislation.,256,,
908,0.97,9187.011,9209.333,The average winter in Seattle has no opportunity to negotiate even the smallest part of their lease when they move into a house or an apartment and as a result many leases have outrageous terms so we do need to continue to strengthen Renters rights to have a full bill of Renters rights and even that will not be enough.,256,,
909,0.97,9209.333,9225.349,"We will need to fight for rent control and we will need to fight to cancel rent and mortgage and utility debt for those who are struggling because of income or job losses because of the pandemic in a recession so I congratulate everybody who fought to win this, let's keep going, when we fight, we win.",256,,
