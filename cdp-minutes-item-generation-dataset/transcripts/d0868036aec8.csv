184,0.97,935.034,954.586,Council staff have done a good job of providing you with a memo laying out the facts and how the intent of that ordinance could be Circumvented despite the fact the county rejected a provision that would guarantee the site would remain a park Inperpetuity.,23,,
185,0.97,1003.635,1006.438,Tionz the park was threatened by the development of the golf course.,23,,
186,0.97,1007.272,1014.98,All of those proposals resulted in initiatives that never went to a vote.,23,,
187,0.97,1014.98,1018.65,Because Council voted to protect Seattle's parks.,23,,
188,0.97,1018.65,1024.022,"Thank you, Donald our next public Commenter is Tiffany McCoy.",24,,
189,0.97,1024.022,1027.192,"Tiffany, you're off mute and can begin when you're ready.",24,,
190,0.97,1028.227,1028.761,Thank you.,24,,
191,0.97,1028.761,1032.331,My name is Tiffany McCoy.,24,,
192,0.97,1032.331,1033.499,I'm the advocacy director.,24,,
193,0.97,1033.499,1040.472,I was calling in as a member of the city coalition.,24,,
194,0.97,1040.472,1047.813,Which was advocating for public land at City Hall park.,24,,
195,0.97,1047.813,1057.956,And the low income and Unhoused neighborhoods that use that.,24,,
196,0.97,1057.956,1061.66,It's fenced in and there's an endless Timeline on it.,24,,
197,0.97,1061.66,1065.831,I wanted to address concerns around safety.,24,,
198,0.97,1065.831,1067.966,And we have a homeless problem in the city.,24,,
199,0.97,1067.966,1069.635,We know those things.,24,,
200,0.97,1069.635,1073.939,Transferring City Hall park to the county will not resolve any of those issues.,24,,
201,0.97,1073.939,1076.642,This is not the answer to safety concerns.,24,,
202,0.97,1076.642,1078.877,Or people that are Unhoused.,24,,
203,0.97,1078.877,1085.317,"So let's address the root causes of poverty, crime, homelessness, and maintain our parks.",24,,
204,0.97,1085.317,1089.154,We can do both.,24,,
205,0.97,1089.154,1089.421,And Yeah.,24,,
206,0.97,1089.421,1090.589,Calling for a change.,24,,
207,0.97,1090.589,1093.992,We really want the city to take some time.,24,,
208,0.97,1093.992,1100.098,I'm happy to have any Councilmembers.,24,,
209,0.97,1100.098,1103.335,Come listen to concerns over the spaces in the area.,24,,
210,0.97,1103.335,1105.904,Please don't sell this off to the county.,24,,
211,0.97,1105.904,1111.643,This is really like a really important park to vendors when it used to be not fenced in.,24,,
212,0.97,1111.643,1114.713,Thank you.,24,,
213,0.97,1115.38,1117.483,"Thank you, Tiffany.",25,,
214,0.97,1117.483,1122.821,Our next public Commenter is the Honnable Patrick Oishe.,25,,
215,0.97,1122.821,1125.924,You're off mute and can begin when ready.,25,,
216,0.97,1125.924,1127.659,Thank you.,26,,
217,0.97,1127.659,1128.36,Good afternoon.,26,,
218,0.97,1128.36,1130.529,My name is Patrick Oishe.,26,,
219,0.97,1130.529,1135.234,And I'm the Presiding judge of King County Superior Court.,26,,
220,0.97,1135.234,1146.245,I'd like to thank the committee members as well as committee chair Lewis for considering this extremely important legislation.,26,,
221,0.97,1146.245,1150.949,I'm addressing the committee both as a long time Seattle resident.,26,,
222,0.97,1150.949,1158.19,As well as the Presiding judge of the largest trial court in the state.,26,,
223,0.97,1158.19,1170.736,I'm respectfully requesting that this committee support the city hall Parkland transfer for a number of very important reasons.,26,,
224,0.97,1170.736,1177.643,"First, it absolutely makes the most sense that city hall Park is part of King County's downtown campus.",26,,
225,0.97,1177.643,1192.624,"As we all know, the park is immediately adjacent to the King County courthouse which is both the seat of County government as well as where King County Superior Court is housed.",26,,
226,0.97,1192.624,1200.299,"In the park, it's truly the front yard of King County government.",26,,
227,0.97,1200.299,1208.707,"Second, the courthouse and surrounding area must be safe for everyone to access.",26,,
228,0.97,1208.707,1223.288,"In many instances, those who come to court do not have a choice but to come to court because of their personal circumstances or because they've been Summonsed or subpoenaed to come to court.",26,,
229,0.97,1223.288,1225.123,All Mustfeel safe.,26,,
230,0.97,1225.123,1233.332,"When they come to court, or justice will be denied.",26,,
231,0.97,1233.332,1240.973,In a land transfer with King County would be a huge step for safety in the area.,26,,
232,0.97,1240.973,1244.142,And would ensure access to justice.,26,,
233,0.97,1244.142,1249.181,I strongly encourage the committee to support the legislation.,26,,
234,0.97,1249.181,1249.414,Thank you.,26,,
235,0.97,1250.249,1253.051,"Thank you, Judge Oishe.",27,,
236,0.97,1253.051,1258.79,Our last public Commenter who is currently present is Eric Sallinger.,27,,
237,0.97,1258.79,1261.727,"Eric, take us away.",27,,
238,0.97,1261.727,1262.694,"Yeah, Hi.",28,,
239,0.97,1262.694,1264.763,My name is Eric Sallinger.,28,,
240,0.97,1264.763,1268.233,I live in district seven.,28,,
241,0.97,1268.233,1270.869,And I'm calling about the park development.,28,,
242,0.97,1270.869,1288.186,"I think there's basically two main issues, the first issue is as far as I can tell from following what's been going on at the county level, if we were to engage if this land transfer from the park to the county, it would lose its protected status as a park.",28,,
243,0.97,1288.186,1289.921,It can be Redeveloped as anything.,28,,
244,0.97,1289.921,1296.862,I'm going to guess that park in downtown Seattle if it were a building would be $50 million.,28,,
245,0.97,1296.862,1300.165,So giving $50 million to the county or more seems absurd.,28,,
246,0.97,1300.165,1306.371,How many initiatives could each of you fund with 50 to $75 million or possibly more.,28,,
247,0.97,1306.371,1307.205,Things we need.,28,,
248,0.97,1307.205,1310.242,The programs that are important for folks downtown.,28,,
249,0.97,1310.242,1321.586,My second issue with this is the county told us that they are--they talk about Oh we're thinking about leaving Seattle.,28,,
250,0.97,1321.586,1322.154,"Well, that's interesting.",28,,
251,0.97,1322.154,1327.225,Because there's a plan that was supposed to come out in 2021 for their civic center.,28,,
252,0.97,1327.225,1328.527,I forget what it was called.,28,,
253,0.97,1328.527,1331.296,Supposed to come out in 2021 and it hasn't.,28,,
254,0.97,1331.296,1334.8,"If we're going to be serious about selling this Park, we should get the value for it.",28,,
255,0.97,1334.8,1344.776,But the problem with the park is it's in an area with government buildings and public service providers.,28,,
256,0.97,1344.776,1350.182,There's nothing there to keep the park active after 5:00 P.M.,28,,
257,0.97,1350.182,1361.093,"We have prime Realestate that can be developed into mixed use, residential, low income, middle income, high income housing in a wonderful neighborhood of Seattle with great transit access.",28,,
258,0.97,1361.093,1370.769,"None of that is going to happen or rather if that does happen, that park could be an amazing space to anchor the community together.",28,,
259,0.97,1370.769,1380.278,"Unfortunately, if we give it to the county for free or for some other land that isn't worth that kind of money, that may just not happen.",28,,
260,0.97,1380.278,1381.98,I encourage the Council to reject this.,28,,
261,0.97,1381.98,1383.548,I think we want the park.,28,,
262,0.97,1383.548,1385.384,And I think we want the neighborhood.,28,,
263,0.97,1385.384,1387.252,And I think we should focus on that.,28,,
264,0.97,1387.252,1389.154,So thank you for your time.,28,,
265,0.97,1390.122,1391.69,"Thank you, Eric.",29,,
266,0.97,1391.69,1397.829,"Mr. chair, there are no more present public Commenters.",29,,
267,0.97,1397.829,1400.465,"Thank you so much, Mr.",30,,
268,0.97,1400.465,1400.699,Clerk.,30,,
269,0.97,1400.699,1404.336,And we're ending the public comment a little bit ahead of schedule.,30,,
270,0.97,1404.336,1405.07,So that's good.,30,,
271,0.97,1405.07,1407.806,The committee is all ready ahead of schedule.,30,,
272,0.97,1407.806,1409.274,Let's work to keep it that way.,30,,
273,0.97,1409.274,1412.477,So we'll move on to our items of business.,30,,
274,0.97,1412.477,1417.382,"Mr. clerk, would you please read in the first item of business.",30,,
275,0.97,1417.382,1423.655,"Item one, city hall park Intergovernmental land transfer briefing and discussion.",31,,
276,0.97,1423.655,1425.323,"Thank you, Mr. clerk.",32,,
277,0.97,1425.323,1442.541,"We are now joined by an extensive panel for this presentation, including superintendent Christopher Williams from Seattle parks.",32,,
278,0.97,1442.541,1442.774,Sorry.,32,,
279,0.97,1442.774,1447.279,Can everyone that's joining go off--go on to Video.,32,,
280,0.97,1447.279,1447.479,Okay.,32,,
281,0.97,1447.479,1449.481,It looks like everyone is.,32,,
282,0.97,1449.481,1452.651,Emery from the Mayor's office.,32,,
283,0.97,1452.651,1452.851,Welcome.,32,,
284,0.97,1456.188,1460.525,Jackie Kearn.,32,,
285,0.97,1460.525,1463.261,Lisa Howard.,32,,
286,0.97,1463.261,1463.595,Rebecca bear.,32,,
287,0.97,1463.595,1465.831,"And director, you're for the next presentation, correct?",32,,
288,0.97,1465.831,1466.998,Yes.,33,,
289,0.97,1466.998,1470.068,"Okay, good, just making sure.",34,,
290,0.97,1470.068,1470.669,And Kalie knight.,34,,
291,0.97,1470.669,1476.708,Did I Miss anybody for this discussion?,34,,
292,0.97,1476.708,1479.644,Go off mute and say so if I did.,35,,
293,0.97,1479.644,1479.744,For,35,,
294,0.97,1481.246,1484.349,"Tony Wright, King County facilities management Commission.",36,,
295,0.97,1484.349,1485.951,"Thank you so much, Mr.",37,,
296,0.97,1485.951,1487.052,"Wright, appreciate that.",37,,
297,0.97,1487.052,1493.058,So I think the way I want to divide this is we have two panels.,38,,
298,0.97,1493.058,1495.427,One that might be best described as a county panel.,38,,
299,0.97,1495.427,1500.899,One that might be best described as a pioneer square Stakeholder and parks panel.,38,,
300,0.97,1500.899,1517.349,So the way I would like to proceed with this is Maybe to hear from our partners at King County first and to include some of our city officials in that panel as well.,38,,
301,0.97,1517.349,1526.391,"So superintendent Williams, and chief equity officer Emery to include you in this sort of initial panel.",38,,
302,0.97,1526.391,1534.165,But obviously I would invite everyone to stay around when we hear from the alliance.,38,,
303,0.97,1534.165,1535.233,Among other Stakeholders.,38,,
304,0.97,1535.233,1539.571,"So with that, I think I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to the county.",38,,
305,0.97,1539.571,1542.874,And invite the county Presenters to introduce themselves.,38,,
306,0.97,1542.874,1551.016,And then to proceed with their presentation.,38,,
307,0.97,1552.05,1557.088,"Good afternoon, committee members, chair Lewis, members of the public, my name is Kalie knight.",38,,
308,0.97,1557.088,1561.826,I use she and her pronouns and I direct the program out of executive Constantine's office.,38,,
309,0.97,1561.826,1577.375,"And I have been in conversation with many of the Stakeholders on the line about City Hall park and the proposed land transfer of my colleague Tony Wright, I'll let him introduce himself and make some brief comments.",38,,
310,0.97,1577.375,1577.609,Hi.,39,,
311,0.97,1577.609,1577.909,Mr. chair.,39,,
312,0.97,1577.909,1579.344,Members of the committee.,39,,
313,0.97,1579.344,1580.345,And the public.,39,,
314,0.97,1580.345,1582.747,My name is Tony Wright.,39,,
315,0.97,1582.747,1584.316,I use He/Him pronouns.,39,,
316,0.97,1584.316,1588.787,I'm the director of facilities management division in that role.,39,,
317,0.97,1588.787,1592.624,I both oversee the maintenance of our buildings and grounds.,39,,
318,0.97,1592.624,1596.294,But also am in charge of the county Realestate portfolio.,39,,
319,0.97,1596.294,1603.868,So I have two kind of areas where I touched this particular issue.,39,,
320,0.97,1603.868,1604.369,Great.,40,,
321,0.97,1604.369,1604.669,Thank you.,40,,
322,0.97,1604.669,1611.409,"So I'll just make some brief comments and then I'm happy to turn it to my colleague, Tony, or answer any questions that folks might have.",40,,
323,0.97,1611.409,1635.133,"But as far as the proposed land transfer of city hall park goes, the county is excited to be able to take ownership of the park, make it clear that it is going to be substantially used Inperpetuity as public space.",40,,
324,0.97,1636.568,1640.472,We have 6000 employees who work in the neighborhood.,40,,
325,0.97,1640.472,1646.478,"And some live in the neighborhood and commute in and out of the neighborhood, patronize businesses in neighborhood as well.",40,,
326,0.97,1646.478,1655.387,So we are working community Stakeholders but also our employees as a Stakeholder as well.,40,,
327,0.97,1655.387,1662.527,We're excited to be able to transfer additional open space to be used by Seattle city residents.,40,,
328,0.97,1662.527,1670.835,And are very much looking forward to a robust and collaborative public process should the transfer occur.,40,,
329,0.97,1670.835,1675.106,And would be happy to answer any questions that committee members have.,40,,
330,0.97,1675.106,1680.478,"Tony, do you have anything that you wanted to add?",40,,
331,0.97,1684.482,1689.487,I think only the fact that we've sent some proposed covenants to be established.,40,,
332,0.97,1689.487,1691.589,To be enforceable by the city.,40,,
333,0.97,1691.589,1696.261,Because we can't as a county Covenant ourselves over the future use of this park.,40,,
334,0.97,1696.261,1701.966,I know that's being reviewed by the city attorney's office.,40,,
335,0.97,1701.966,1717.649,But I would state that is an important aspect because one of the things we heard leading up to this and throughout public comment is this brief that we just want to pave it over or put a building on it or something.,40,,
336,0.97,1717.649,1735.9,And the covenants that we have proposed that would travel with the land in Perpetuity.,40,,
337,0.97,1740.138,1743.942,I was just going to comment.,41,,
338,0.97,1743.942,1746.778,I'm with the Mayor's office.,41,,
339,0.97,1746.778,1756.02,"Even though the agreement didn't happen with this administration, we're moving forward and excited to hear that King County is honoring the open space.",41,,
340,0.97,1756.02,1757.756,And tree canopy are important.,41,,
341,0.97,1757.756,1762.594,Which are especially for the downtown area where we have limited open space and green space.,41,,
342,0.97,1762.594,1766.197,So we are here to encourage to work with us.,41,,
343,0.97,1766.197,1770.568,Continue to work with us in advancing those priorities.,41,,
344,0.97,1770.568,1777.709,And we're also here to support the land transition and the requirement that's needed.,41,,
345,0.97,1779.41,1781.045,Hi.,42,,
346,0.97,1781.045,1782.013,This is --,42,,
347,0.97,1782.013,1783.515,"Go ahead, superintendent.",43,,
348,0.97,1783.515,1783.815,Thank you.,43,,
349,0.97,1783.815,1786.951,I was just going to ask if you wanted to make some remarks.,43,,
350,0.97,1786.951,1787.619,"Go ahead, please.",43,,
351,0.97,1787.619,1797.829,"I would like to highlight a few comments made by Donald Harris, the former Seattle park and recreation property manager.",44,,
352,0.97,1797.829,1808.006,"You know, the spirit and intent of initiative 42 was designed to protect public open space in Perpetuity.",44,,
353,0.97,1808.006,1819.117,"We would be very interested in knowing more about covenants that allow sort of the keeping of the, you know, the space as public open space.",44,,
354,0.97,1819.117,1819.45,And Parkland.,44,,
355,0.97,1819.45,1840.738,"I think one of the things that is really important to call out is prior to the pandemic, Councilmember Bagshaw funded the--or found funding for the public life study for city hall Park, that resulted in a whole range of activation uses.",44,,
356,0.97,1840.738,1843.308,"You know, and Pre-Pandemic.",44,,
357,0.97,1843.308,1847.412,That park probably saw its best life.,44,,
358,0.97,1847.412,1848.947,"You know, in probably 50 years.",44,,
359,0.97,1848.947,1858.323,And I think that's an example of the kind of activation strategy and the kind of public uses that this park could return to.,44,,
360,0.97,1858.323,1863.928,Regardless of whose ownership it ultimately results in being in.,44,,
361,0.97,1863.928,1881.045,But I think the idea that it has been successfully programmed and used as public open space is really an important consideration moving forward.,44,,
362,0.97,1881.045,1886.951,Thank you to the county and to some of our executive side partners for that presentation and those comments.,44,,
363,0.97,1886.951,1890.154,I have a couple of questions for this group.,44,,
364,0.97,1890.154,1896.861,Here before we hear from some other Stakeholders who have an interest in this conversation.,44,,
365,0.97,1896.861,1900.231,And I don't know exactly who would be best to answer these.,44,,
366,0.97,1900.231,1904.469,So we'll just sort of do a RAISES of hand as I kind of go through.,44,,
367,0.97,1904.469,1906.404,If someone has something to add.,44,,
368,0.97,1906.404,1909.407,In terms of this Committee.,44,,
369,0.97,1909.407,1913.645,Getting a sense for contours of possibly reaching an agreement.,44,,
370,0.97,1913.645,1918.016,Between the city and the county on this.,44,,
371,0.97,1918.016,1927.425,With an eye toward the county seeking city council approval for some kind of potential.,44,,
372,0.97,1927.425,1930.495,But I guess as a preliminary matter.,44,,
373,0.97,1930.495,1944.042,"Maybe just asking for clarification from Ceo Emery, is it the Herald administration's position that they would like to see the transfer go through?",44,,
374,0.97,1944.042,1949.747,Because I don't foe if that had within made clear to me before today's hearing.,44,,
375,0.97,1949.747,1951.649,So just as a threshold matter.,44,,
376,0.97,1951.649,1952.684,I'm curious about that.,44,,
377,0.97,1953.217,1959.557,We feel like the agreement and process has gone too far for us to pivot at this point.,45,,
378,0.97,1959.557,1963.294,So we will honor the agreements that are set.,45,,
379,0.97,1963.294,1969.267,That were established and move forward.,45,,
380,0.97,1969.267,1979.344,"But also again, to, Christopher Williams' point, preserving--what would it take to preserve that open space and green space as we transition this land swap.",45,,
381,0.97,1980.678,1981.579,Okay.,46,,
382,0.97,1981.579,1988.953,"I mean I guess--I mean, just as a threshold matter though, any agreement would have to have the Council's concurrence.",46,,
383,0.97,1988.953,1995.526,So I mean we're still kind of at the beginning of a fairly long process.,46,,
384,0.97,1995.526,2003.234,So but it sounds like the Herald administration would like to see the transfer go forward and it sounds like that's the administration's position.,46,,
385,0.97,2003.234,2008.272,So that is good information for the committee to be aware of.,46,,
386,0.97,2008.272,2016.881,I think this question would be for the county.,46,,
387,0.97,2016.881,2028.359,So my understanding is that there's going to be 12 parcels from the county offered in exchange for the city hall park parcel.,46,,
388,0.97,2028.359,2047.178,"And I'm curious about what the county's considerations were in selecting those twelve parcels and maybe if the Presenters today are--well, first for the county Presenters, maybe just a bit of an overview of those twelve parcels for the general public and for the committee members.",46,,
389,0.97,2047.178,2053.217,"And then the superintendent Williams, if you've had a chance to kind of review those parcels a little.",46,,
390,0.97,2053.217,2059.991,It'll approximate interesting to hear the park Department's position on those parcels.,46,,
391,0.97,2059.991,2063.661,And what future activation plans for those might be.,46,,
392,0.97,2063.661,2071.969,So why don't we start with the county panel to kind of just get an overview of those parcels that are on offer.,46,,
393,0.97,2071.969,2078.676,And News10 then I'd like to hear from the superintendent.,46,,
394,0.97,2080.445,2084.382,Let me--I think that was a meaningful look from Kelly.,47,,
395,0.97,2084.382,2087.452,That she would like me to answer that question.,47,,
396,0.97,2087.452,2105.536,"So [Laughter] so first, I would just--I think it's useful to understand the discussion of which parcels would occur would transfer was an interactive process.",47,,
397,0.97,2105.536,2112.61,Identified through elements of the city government and the executive branch and the county.,47,,
398,0.97,2112.61,2115.88,And we went back and forth with some of those.,47,,
399,0.97,2115.88,2129.093,One of the things that's been stated before is the intrinsic land value that may be present.,47,,
400,0.97,2129.093,2129.427,Unrestricted.,47,,
401,0.97,2129.427,2135.132,I Unoccur absolutely that the property is worth a lot of money.,47,,
402,0.97,2135.132,2138.269,I concur--I'm not sure I'd go as high as 50.,47,,
403,0.97,2138.269,2142.773,But probably 25 to $35 million in value if it's unrestricted.,47,,
404,0.97,2142.773,2146.277,We're not proposing to accept that property unrestricted.,47,,
405,0.97,2146.277,2159.957,Nor are we transferring any of the open space properties that are part of this 12 over to the city without asking also for the city's assurances that they would remain open space.,47,,
406,0.97,2159.957,2174.805,"And I believe, although I didn't speak with superintendent Williams personally on this, I believe parks Department had some interaction with the Mayor's office on which parcels they were interested in at this time.",47,,
407,0.97,2174.805,2178.643,I do not have the specific list of those in front of me.,47,,
408,0.97,2178.643,2182.98,"But I can pull that up in a second and perhaps Mr. chair, you could come back to me.",47,,
409,0.97,2182.98,2185.349,And I can go through my list.,47,,
410,0.97,2185.349,2190.488,Because I remember the ones that are--I remember the significant ones.,47,,
411,0.97,2190.488,2199.931,But some of them are honestly small portions of County property that are adjacent to existing city parks.,47,,
412,0.97,2199.931,2208.94,And they are just slightly additive to that particular park in this case.,47,,
413,0.97,2208.94,2210.041,So they will do that.,47,,
414,0.97,2210.041,2216.48,I need to pull the list up really quick in order to walk through it with a degree of accuracy.,47,,
415,0.97,2216.48,2221.586,Rather than depending on my somewhat deteriorated brain cells to remember.,47,,
416,0.97,2221.586,2227.792,"That's perfectly fine, we can go to Kalie for a moment to give you an opportunity to do that.",48,,
417,0.97,2227.792,2232.697,"It might be--quite honestly, just to jump in too a little.",48,,
418,0.97,2232.697,2239.57,"I was honestly kind of expecting maybe, you know, like a presentation from the county.",48,,
419,0.97,2239.57,2244.075,Or like a slide deck that might incorporate Overviews of those parcels.,48,,
420,0.97,2244.075,2249.847,And maybe that might be just flagging maybe a subject for a future hearing that we might have on this.,48,,
421,0.97,2249.847,2253.384,Just as something we might consider.,48,,
422,0.97,2253.384,2257.054,"We could absolutely do that, Mr. chair.",49,,
423,0.97,2257.054,2262.393,I thought I was coming to answer questions.,49,,
424,0.97,2262.393,2277.675,But we can--that's probably my misunderstanding and I'll ensure that I can come in with a presentation that can address each of these and how that works in the future if that's what the committee desires.,49,,
425,0.97,2277.675,2288.252,"Yeah, I mean if the Council is going to approve swapping an asset the size of city hall Park, I think it will be good for us to go into detail on the twelve other parcels.",49,,
426,0.97,2288.252,2291.889,And we can do a little bit of that in this meeting.,49,,
427,0.97,2291.889,2298.429,But that might be a good kind of work product request for next hearing on the topic.,49,,
428,0.97,2298.429,2300.031,So just flagging that.,49,,
429,0.97,2300.031,2305.302,But did you have something to add to that?,49,,
430,0.97,2305.302,2309.807,While we give Mr. Wright an opportunity to load up the list of twelve parcels.,49,,
431,0.97,2309.807,2312.576,"No, I don't have anything to add.",50,,
432,0.97,2312.576,2315.613,"Not at this time, thanks, Councilmember.",50,,
433,0.97,2315.613,2318.582,"Councilmember Lewis, Tracy, council central staff.",51,,
434,0.97,2318.582,2321.052,My memo that's attached to the agenda.,51,,
435,0.97,2321.052,2322.086,Sorry to interrupt.,51,,
436,0.97,2322.086,2324.855,But the memo attached to your agenda.,51,,
437,0.97,2324.855,2328.125,Attachment one has each one of the properties listed.,51,,
438,0.97,2328.125,2331.662,Attachment two shows a map of where the properties are located.,51,,
439,0.97,2331.662,2335.666,We have provide Thaad to the Councilmembers in that memo.,51,,
440,0.97,2335.666,2337.201,"Great, excellent.",52,,
441,0.97,2337.201,2341.972,And I'm aware of that from reviewing the memo.,52,,
442,0.97,2341.972,2348.646,But I wanted to give the county sort of an opportunity to pitch the parcels to the committee.,52,,
443,0.97,2348.646,2365.262,"Do we have a sense, maybe, Tracy, this is a good question for you, I don't know where this is at this time, but do we have a sense of the appraisal sort of value to value of the parcels to city hall park?",52,,
444,0.97,2365.262,2377.241,"With the caveat that Mr. Wright issued that it wouldn't be an unrestricted parcel, which would have value implications for city hall park and then vice versa.",52,,
445,0.97,2377.241,2380.444,Did we have a sense on how that stacks up?,52,,
446,0.97,2380.444,2386.851,"So to my knowledge, no appraisals have been done on any of the properties that are involved in this traps for.",53,,
447,0.97,2386.851,2391.222,I did Enquier of Mr. Wright if there were any appraisals.,53,,
448,0.97,2391.222,2401.665,And I did not hear back.,53,,
449,0.97,2405.97,2407.905,No formal appraisals.,54,,
450,0.97,2407.905,2412.176,We did not do appraisals on any of this property.,54,,
451,0.97,2412.176,2415.579,Some of which have had Estimations of value in their past.,54,,
452,0.97,2415.579,2416.881,And other elements.,54,,
453,0.97,2416.881,2427.224,"But in our initial discussions with the previous administration, you know, we settled upon an area in negotiation.",54,,
454,0.97,2427.224,2442.573,"Because we recognized right up front that the location of the park, if it was unrestricted property would render that completely outside the scale.",54,,
455,0.97,2442.573,2449.713,Which is one of the reasons we also have three times as much property being conveyed in terms of area.,54,,
456,0.97,2449.713,2452.349,But we went through it for an area negotiation.,54,,
457,0.97,2452.349,2454.118,Not a price negotiation.,54,,
458,0.97,2454.118,2462.493,"Which is why to my knowledge, neither the county nor the city conducted appraisals related to this transfer.",54,,
459,0.97,2463.961,2468.265,Is it--is that a common alternative metric?,55,,
460,0.97,2468.265,2474.004,To do an area ratio rather than a value ratio?,55,,
461,0.97,2474.004,2476.707,And maybe superintendent Williams has a clarification on that?,55,,
462,0.97,2476.707,2481.512,"So we would absolutely at some point, as we get further into this.",56,,
463,0.97,2481.512,2486.65,We want to do a dollar value for value appraisal.,56,,
464,0.97,2486.65,2491.355,My gut check is we just haven't gotten to that point in the process yet.,56,,
465,0.97,2491.355,2510.975,"Also, on some of the questions you asked earlier about the land value--or rather about parcels, there's a parcel in South Park that is adjacent to a property--rather a parceled property we all ready own that we're working with the community to try to develop.",56,,
466,0.97,2510.975,2517.414,We believe that that has some value to the existing project.,56,,
467,0.97,2517.414,2524.021,It's contiguous with the South Park Plaza project we've been working on now for four or five years.,56,,
468,0.97,2524.021,2530.394,The other parcel that has some utility value is the parcel adjacent to Yesler community center.,56,,
469,0.97,2530.394,2534.732,Of course we have the community center there.,56,,
470,0.97,2534.732,2536.967,You have an athletic field there.,56,,
471,0.97,2536.967,2551.148,We look for Ajayi Sen Adjacencies.,56,,
472,0.97,2551.148,2556.987,Verses places that create extra work for maintenance staff and are not connected to existing parcels of land.,56,,
473,0.97,2556.987,2560.557,So that's a little background on what's in the inventory.,56,,
474,0.97,2560.557,2562.626,Those are the two biggest pieces that stand out.,56,,
475,0.97,2563.36,2567.898,"So I notice my colleague Haves a couple questions, are they related?",57,,
476,0.97,2567.898,2582.613,Are they questions related to the county parcels? or are they related to a different topic I'm looking at Councilmember Morales and Mosqueda here.,57,,
477,0.97,2582.613,2583.747,Councilmember Morales.,57,,
478,0.97,2583.747,2587.451,Yes and is what I'll say here.,58,,
479,0.97,2587.451,2590.621,But I'm happy to stick to this one for now.,58,,
480,0.97,2590.621,2598.128,So I really am interested in this question of different Metrics for appraisal.,58,,
481,0.97,2598.128,2606.77,Because understanding that the idea is not to maybe a swap for the purpose of development and all that might mean in terms of value.,58,,
482,0.97,2606.77,2611.208,"But still, in terms of utility, you know, which also has value.",58,,
483,0.97,2611.208,2618.282,"So many of these are really small, you know, there's a couple that are less than 300 square feet.",58,,
484,0.97,2618.282,2620.517,Some--several of them are much bigger than that.,58,,
485,0.97,2620.517,2635.099,"But I'm just thinking in terms of added value to city users and, you know, not sure what the city's gain would be in terms of being able to use these parcels.",58,,
486,0.97,2635.099,2641.205,"I think my question might be for I don't know, maybe this is a question for Lish.",58,,
487,0.97,2641.205,2652.916,But I am interested in understanding to Miss Emery's point about the agreement having gone too far to change course.,58,,
488,0.97,2652.916,2657.421,Understanding better where exactly we are in the Timeline of this process.,58,,
489,0.97,2657.421,2664.361,Because I understand we haven't even begun Sepa and there's still a lot of work to do.,58,,
490,0.97,2664.361,2667.631,And no decisions can be made until that process is through.,58,,
491,0.97,2667.631,2684.782,So I feel like we've got plenty of opportunity to weigh the balance of whether this is actually good for the city or not.,58,,
492,0.97,2684.782,2685.849,Okay I'll answer.,58,,
493,0.97,2685.849,2693.924,"[Laughter] Councilmember, you have from the Council's perspective, there's to deal here until you adopt legislation that authorizes the deal.",58,,
494,0.97,2693.924,2695.793,From the Council's perspective.,58,,
495,0.97,2695.793,2697.361,We've not even taken up the legislation.,58,,
496,0.97,2697.361,2701.532,This is your first conversation publicly about the legislation.,58,,
497,0.97,2701.532,2704.668,"So from the Council's perspective, we've got some time.",58,,
498,0.97,2704.668,2707.671,I wouldn't want to even begin to speak for the executive on this.,58,,
499,0.97,2707.671,2714.411,"So you know, their new administration, and I'll let them speak for themselves in terms of their perspective on this.",58,,
500,0.97,2715.179,2717.815,"Thank you, Tracy.",59,,
501,0.97,2717.815,2722.486,"Councilmember Morales, do you have other questions.",59,,
502,0.97,2722.486,2724.722,Or did that answer all your questions?,59,,
503,0.97,2724.722,2731.395,"I appreciate having, for the record, where exactly we are in the Timeline of this process.",60,,
504,0.97,2731.395,2750.481,And really just wanted to make a comment that part of my concern is looking at the compare ability and the value of what's being offered in exchange for this very nice city owned piece of land that could serve as an important park downtown.,60,,
505,0.97,2753.35,2754.184,Okay.,61,,
506,0.97,2754.184,2759.156,"Let's go ahead and--Councilmember Mosqueda, you had a question related to the parcels too.",61,,
507,0.97,2759.156,2763.927,"Yeah, thank you very much, Mr. chair.",62,,
508,0.97,2763.927,2766.764,And again thanks to the central staff for the memo.,62,,
509,0.97,2766.764,2768.766,I'm looking at page four of the memo.,62,,
510,0.97,2768.766,2779.076,"And it says for city hall Park, the county commits that the city hall park will continue to be used for public open space, a park, a recreation and community facility.",62,,
511,0.97,2779.076,2789.386,The expansion of existing County facility or public benefit purpose provided that any such purpose shall be used by the general public and primarily Noncommercial in nature.,62,,
512,0.97,2789.386,2800.764,And the open comments that were made by Kelly and perhaps others was the intent to have this remain a public open space in Perpetuity.,62,,
513,0.97,2800.764,2807.137,"So I appreciate that comment here, and also the clarification that Councilmember Morales thought about where we're at in the process.",62,,
514,0.97,2807.137,2812.576,Given that the intent from the opt is to have an open public space in Perpetuity.,62,,
515,0.97,2812.576,2817.848,And there were a number of folks who called in.,62,,
516,0.97,2817.848,2819.616,Desiring open space in Perpetuity as well.,62,,
517,0.97,2819.616,2823.22,What would it look like to codify that?,62,,
518,0.97,2823.22,2827.257,Is that something the Council modifies in the Covenant on City Hall Park is.,62,,
519,0.97,2827.257,2832.796,That something that the city council needs to do to codify in city statute somewhere?,62,,
520,0.97,2832.796,2838.268,Can you tell me if that's the intent and the future use if the county were to acquire this property.,62,,
521,0.97,2838.268,2843.273,And it sounds like there's a shared desire for open public space in Perpetuity.,62,,
522,0.97,2843.273,2846.276,Where does that get codified in both jurisdictions?,62,,
523,0.97,2846.276,2848.045,From the Council's perspective.,63,,
524,0.97,2848.045,2852.349,It would be in this Intergovernmental transfer agreement attached to the ordinance.,63,,
525,0.97,2852.349,2859.289,I believe there is some language being circulated by the county that would modify even what's been shown in the memo.,63,,
526,0.97,2859.289,2860.29,Late breaking information.,63,,
527,0.97,2860.29,2862.926,I'll have them speak to that.,63,,
528,0.97,2862.926,2869.433,"But it would, for certain we would modify the language in the Covenant in the intergovernmental transfer.",63,,
529,0.97,2869.433,2874.638,Which is an attachment to the ordinance that the Council will adopt.,63,,
530,0.97,2875.172,2879.776,"Thank you, and anybody from the county?",64,,
531,0.97,2879.776,2884.581,About where that will be housed?,64,,
532,0.97,2884.581,2887.351,I'll take a stab at that.,65,,
533,0.97,2887.351,2905.135,"The process that I would understand is that, if modifications were made by the city Council to the agreement that caused the agreement to be substantially different from what it currently is.",65,,
534,0.97,2905.135,2917.848,And substantially different is one of those nice terms that isn't clearly defined.,65,,
535,0.97,2917.848,2923.053,Then I would need to transmit that agreement back to the Council Council to agree on it.,65,,
536,0.97,2923.053,2927.057,If it's closed under our code the city could make some adjustments.,65,,
537,0.97,2927.057,2935.899,We believe the adjustments we proposed in the Covenant language would be consistent with the authority where it would not need to go back to the county Council.,65,,
538,0.97,2935.899,2939.269,But that's sort of how the process goes back and forth.,65,,
539,0.97,2939.269,2949.479,"Both councils would need to agree on it or have it close enough that essentially a reconciliation committee could say Yeah, we're here.",65,,
540,0.97,2949.479,2964.428,"And then we have binding documents that would, in a Realestate perspective, Memorialize the aspects and the decisions of the two legislative bodies, Tracy, how'd I do?",65,,
541,0.97,2964.428,2965.462,"Very well, Tony.",66,,
542,0.97,2965.462,2967.03,[Laughter].,66,,
543,0.97,2967.03,2968.398,"Councilmember Herbold, you have a question.",67,,
544,0.97,2968.398,2971.234,Thank you so much.,68,,
545,0.97,2971.234,2992.189,"So as it relates to this notion of creating a Covenant that would maintain the property in Perpetuity as parks and open space, it seems to me that given that we haven't begun the Sipa process yet.",68,,
546,0.97,2992.189,2998.795,And I want to thank central staff for their work on identifying this as a transfer that would be triggered.,68,,
547,0.97,2998.795,3001.932,That Sepa would be triggered for at the end of last year.,68,,
548,0.97,3001.932,3007.704,The previous administration had been arguing Sepa wasn't triggered.,68,,
549,0.97,3007.704,3011.942,So I really appreciate setting us on the right path there.,68,,
550,0.97,3011.942,3035.399,But it seems to me that doing Sepa review on a piece of property where we have a legally binding commitment to maintain the property as open space in Perpetuity that that Sepa process would have a particular outcome that would differ Sigg nigh aptly from a Sepa process on a property transfer that doesn't make any such promises.,68,,
551,0.97,3035.399,3041.004,"So I'm just wondering if, you know, given that we haven't begun the Sepa process yet.",68,,
552,0.97,3041.004,3051.848,Wouldn't it make sense to get those commitments confirmed before beginning Sepa.,68,,
553,0.97,3051.848,3062.092,"Because it seems like if we don't, we're going to have, we're potentially going to have lots of things that the Sepa process tells us that we need to be doing.",68,,
554,0.97,3062.092,3064.494,So just putting that out there.,68,,
555,0.97,3065.262,3075.672,"I wanted to mention, one, I really appreciate superintendent Williams' statement early on.",68,,
556,0.97,3075.672,3096.126,"Quoting former open space director, don Harris, about the spirit of the I-4 2. and even though this legislation Exempts this transaction from I-4 2, I think we really need to get this handled as a matter of policy before moving forward.",68,,
557,0.97,3096.126,3104.534,Whether or not we want--even if we're exempting this from I 42.,68,,
558,0.97,3104.534,3106.603,Which part of I 42.,68,,
559,0.97,3106.603,3111.041,We want to adhere to the spirit of.,68,,
560,0.97,3111.041,3129.693,"Because again, I 42 requires that the land be of equal or better size, value, location or usefulness in the same vicinity, serving the same community and the same park's purposes.",68,,
561,0.97,3129.693,3131.128,That's clearly not something we're meeting now.,68,,
562,0.97,3131.128,3144.908,And I think it would be great to get a sense from the Council on the front end what parts of I 42 I 42 we think are still really important to us.,68,,
563,0.97,3144.908,3153.049,"And Lastly, I want to just--this is also just flagging a point that superintendent Williams made.",68,,
564,0.97,3153.049,3155.752,But I do have a question.,68,,
565,0.97,3155.752,3184.581,"As it relates to Councilmember Bagshaw's work to get funding for the design of the park, I believe to--and again, tell me if I'm wrong, I thought those dollars had not yet been expended and that there's about, I don't know, something like $400,000 to--and an estimate of about $2 million to do.",68,,
566,0.97,3184.581,3191.288,So the same sort of amazing work that was done down in Occidental.,68,,
567,0.97,3191.288,3206.269,"To really look at ways to program the park, make some space configurations along with Sdot to make some of the entry ways work better for pedestrians and cars.",68,,
568,0.97,3206.269,3210.373,Can you just talk--and I mean that's work that I think has been started.,68,,
569,0.97,3210.373,3212.576,I would hate to just throw that out.,68,,
570,0.97,3212.576,3218.148,So I was just wondering if you could just give a little bit more detail on that.,68,,
571,0.97,3218.148,3218.548,Sure.,69,,
572,0.97,3218.548,3230.527,"So as you recall, Councilmember Bagshaw one of her pet projects before she left was Piloting sort of the transformation of city hall park.",69,,
573,0.97,3230.527,3237.968,"It resulted in an initial 900,000-Dollar allocation.",69,,
574,0.97,3237.968,3243.173,We used a great portion of that to fund a public life study that looked at uses.,69,,
575,0.97,3243.173,3244.474,Looked at communities.,69,,
576,0.97,3244.474,3249.212,Looked at future uses and Stakeholders.,69,,
577,0.97,3249.212,3257.253,We funded a lot of activation Prepandemic that seemed to be successful at the time.,69,,
578,0.97,3257.253,3263.226,"About $400,000 was set aside for redesign and redevelopment of that park.",69,,
579,0.97,3263.226,3269.065,"And you know, it included ideas like maybe fencing some of it.",69,,
580,0.97,3269.065,3271.334,With ornamental fencing.,69,,
581,0.97,3271.334,3272.969,Maybe creating an ornamental garden.,69,,
582,0.97,3272.969,3288.451,"You know, kind of robust community engagement work around, you know, what this park lacks is sort of the same, you know, kind of neighborhood that you'd find adjacent to Lincoln Park for example, right.",69,,
583,0.97,3288.451,3295.925,And then just thinking about ways to sort of get the community more engaged in this park.,69,,
584,0.97,3295.925,3298.194,So it really kind of talked about design.,69,,
585,0.97,3298.194,3306.302,And then what it would take to sustain a redesign of city hall park once any design was built.,69,,
586,0.97,3306.302,3314.844,What sort of community engagement would need to be ongoing to sustain positive uses.,69,,
587,0.97,3314.844,3315.712,Thank you.,70,,
588,0.97,3315.712,3321.551,It really seems like we should be looking at how to implement that.,70,,
589,0.97,3321.551,3322.585,Those--that next phase.,70,,
590,0.97,3322.585,3325.021,So I appreciate that.,70,,
591,0.97,3325.021,3327.29,Do you have a comment as well?,71,,
592,0.97,3327.29,3330.76,I just want to correct my statement early on.,72,,
593,0.97,3330.76,3334.831,When I said like the administration supports the land swap.,72,,
594,0.97,3334.831,3340.904,"Not because of the process have gone down further, but we do support it.",72,,
595,0.97,3340.904,3341.304,As it is.,72,,
596,0.97,3341.304,3348.945,And because King County is honoring the fact that to keep the open space and so forth.,72,,
597,0.97,3348.945,3356.82,"So I'm sure, I just want to kind of correct my statement that we are in support of this land swap.",72,,
598,0.97,3356.82,3360.256,"Thank you, I appreciate the clarification.",73,,
599,0.97,3360.256,3372.902,I have a couple more questions and then maybe a couple of action items for the next hearing that we have on this--on this concept.,73,,
600,0.97,3372.902,3382.679,"My understanding is the way that this is currently envisioned, there would also have to be some city street vacations.",73,,
601,0.97,3382.679,3396.726,And I just want to ask maybe central staff as a preliminary measure to walk the committee through what the requested Street vacations are.,73,,
602,0.97,3396.726,3408.138,And what that process would entail as one of the other kind of X factors in terms of Timelines and designing the work here of what we need to consider.,73,,
603,0.97,3408.138,3411.841,I think it's important to get that on the table in this initial hearing.,73,,
604,0.97,3411.841,3413.409,And I'll start with central staff.,73,,
605,0.97,3413.409,3418.248,And then I'd like to hear responses from other panel members if there's some additional context for that.,73,,
606,0.97,3418.248,3420.183,So why don't we start?,73,,
607,0.97,3420.183,3430.193,I don't know if that's best with Lish or Tracy.,73,,
608,0.97,3430.193,3432.262,"Good afternoon, Lishwizc.",74,,
609,0.97,3432.262,3438.201,Under state law the Council has sole authority to vacate city rights of way.,74,,
610,0.97,3438.201,3461.291,"The process includes filing a petition with the city Council, a review of a--the impacts of the potential vacation, including impacts on light air, open space, circulation, public access, space for utilities.",74,,
611,0.97,3461.291,3469.432,And includes a required public hearing and a commitment for public benefit features.,74,,
612,0.97,3469.432,3488.852,"Not related to the sort of functions of either the park or county facilities, but rather public benefit features in addition to the public's benefit for the parks use.",74,,
613,0.97,3491.221,3501.598,The vacation typically will involve a paid to the Seattle Department of Transportation for analyzing and processing the vacation.,74,,
614,0.97,3501.598,3515.478,"As well as at the end of the vacation process, payment of the appraised value of the right of way that is being transferred to the petitioner if the vacation is approved.",74,,
615,0.97,3517.547,3528.324,"Under the proposed legislation and agreement, the city would cover all of those costs rather than the county covering them.",74,,
616,0.97,3528.324,3532.028,And that's your three second summary of the process.,74,,
617,0.97,3532.028,3535.732,But I'm happy to answer questions.,74,,
618,0.97,3535.732,3542.505,Can we get a sense of what the Timeline would be to go through all of that?,75,,
619,0.97,3542.505,3544.641,It typically takes at least a year.,76,,
620,0.97,3544.641,3550.613,"Oh, Okay, so just the street vacation element of this could--would take at least a year.",77,,
621,0.97,3550.613,3556.519,It would extend passed Council approval of this property transfer most likely.,78,,
622,0.97,3558.788,3560.456,Okay.,79,,
623,0.97,3560.456,3568.531,So the sequencing would be we would do the transfer and then there would subsequently be action around the street vacations.,79,,
624,0.97,3568.531,3575.004,So they would be severed out.,79,,
625,0.97,3575.004,3575.238,Okay.,79,,
626,0.97,3575.238,3575.538,All right.,79,,
627,0.97,3575.538,3581.878,The legislation recognizes the street vacation is a separate process and does not commit the Council to vacating those rights of way.,79,,
628,0.97,3581.878,3583.513,Appreciate that clarification.,80,,
629,0.97,3583.513,3591.854,Do we know about how much fiscal impact covering the street vacations would be?,80,,
630,0.97,3591.854,3594.657,"Well, we don't have an appraisal.",81,,
631,0.97,3594.657,3599.896,For any of the property.,81,,
632,0.97,3599.896,3610.94,And my back of the envelope estimate is that the right of way is as much or greater square footage as the park space that is proposed to be transfer.,81,,
633,0.97,3610.94,3618.014,So you're probably looking at similar appraised value for the right of way as for the parks.,81,,
634,0.97,3618.748,3624.153,But I guess I was also referring to the processing fees.,82,,
635,0.97,3624.153,3625.655,"That's $10,000.",83,,
636,0.97,3625.655,3625.922,Total?,84,,
637,0.97,3625.922,3627.39,Yeah.,85,,
638,0.97,3627.39,3631.761,So that's--it's not a terribly significant in the scheme of our budget.,86,,
639,0.97,3631.761,3632.495,"Okay, great.",86,,
640,0.97,3636.766,3637.033,All right.,86,,
641,0.97,3637.033,3643.239,But the value of the right of way would be Sigg if significant.,86,,
642,0.97,3643.239,3648.945,I just wanted to get clarification on that process.,86,,
643,0.97,3648.945,3649.212,As well.,86,,
644,0.97,3649.212,3659.989,Are there any other comments I guess on that street vacation component now that we've gotten central staff clarification?,86,,
645,0.97,3659.989,3660.89,Mr. Wright.,86,,
646,0.97,3660.89,3662.091,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",87,,
647,0.97,3662.091,3671.234,One thing I would state is that the county is very much willing to pay the processing fees and other things.,87,,
648,0.97,3671.234,3680.643,It got kind of wrapped into the much larger number of what the city typically charges for street vacations.,87,,
649,0.97,3680.643,3687.417,"Which as the county Realestate, I have paid for other things like harbor view and such.",87,,
650,0.97,3687.417,3691.387,We wanted to avoid that particular additional cost.,87,,
651,0.97,3691.387,3700.096,I guess the way I would see it is it would be lost potential revenue to the city.,87,,
652,0.97,3700.096,3704.667,As opposed to an actual expense.,87,,
653,0.97,3706.402,3712.408,"Okay, thank you for that clarification.",88,,
654,0.97,3712.408,3716.079,"Councilmember Mosqueda, you have a follow up on that?",88,,
655,0.97,3716.079,3717.613,I'm so sorry.,89,,
656,0.97,3717.613,3719.515,I might have missed this.,89,,
657,0.97,3719.515,3722.151,Regarding the street vacation.,89,,
658,0.97,3722.151,3724.687,Apologies if you've just commented on this.,89,,
659,0.97,3724.687,3732.261,Is there any impact of the street vacation as noted on page five as well regarding the fourth Avenue bike Lane?,89,,
660,0.97,3732.261,3734.731,Any impact that street vacation would have there.,89,,
661,0.97,3734.731,3737.967,And apologies if you all ready commented on that.,89,,
662,0.97,3740.536,3744.54,It most likely it would not.,90,,
663,0.97,3744.54,3757.086,The street right of way that we're talking about adjacent to and sort of within the park area or between the park and the King County courthouse building.,90,,
664,0.97,3757.086,3763.893,But those sorts of impacts are what would be analyzed through this process.,90,,
665,0.97,3767.597,3773.302,"Lish, can I also just ask as one of my last questions, this is sort of a pivot.",91,,
666,0.97,3773.302,3777.54,But we talked a little bit about Sepa.,91,,
667,0.97,3777.54,3782.011,And Councilmember Herbold had good questions around sequencing of doing the Sepa work.,91,,
668,0.97,3782.011,3791.42,"But I guess my question would be for all parties concerned here, who would like to see a transfer Cued up.",91,,
669,0.97,3791.42,3802.965,When is the soonest that Council could approve a transfer based on the Sepa work?,91,,
670,0.97,3802.965,3812.642,So there is a 21 day appeal period after the publication of a Sepa determination.,92,,
671,0.97,3812.642,3817.98,If it's a determination of land significance.,92,,
672,0.97,3817.98,3821.717,And the Council should not act before that period ends up.,92,,
673,0.97,3821.717,3826.088,"If there's an appeal, then it's a fairly lengthy process.",92,,
674,0.97,3826.088,3831.827,That could result in requirements for an environmental impact statement.,92,,
675,0.97,3831.827,3836.165,"Assuming no appeal, when's the soonest we could potentially vote on the transfer.",93,,
676,0.97,3836.165,3842.772,Probably a month or so after the publication of the Sepa documents.,94,,
677,0.97,3842.772,3853.249,But I guess my question is how long would it take to complete the Sepa documents and publish them?,95,,
678,0.97,3853.249,3858.054,Maybe Mr. Williams?,96,,
679,0.97,3858.054,3861.657,So we have completed the checklist.,97,,
680,0.97,3861.657,3870.099,"And assuming, there's a determination of Nonsignificance issued for the transfer, there's a two-week public comment period.",97,,
681,0.97,3870.099,3872.401,And a three-week appeal period.,97,,
682,0.97,3872.401,3876.239,And these periods run concurrently.,97,,
683,0.97,3876.239,3896.025,"So from today, assuming that we--assuming we receive the checklist, we're about five weeks out assuming no appeals to a determination of Nonsignificant.",97,,
684,0.97,3896.025,3906.035,"And I think as was mentioned Rlier, if there is an appeal, that could push us into an environmental impact statement, which is a much longer process.",97,,
685,0.97,3907.703,3912.174,"Okay, so assuming no appeal, the soonest would be five weeks from today.",98,,
686,0.97,3912.174,3913.843,Yes.,99,,
687,0.97,3913.843,3915.845,"Okay, that's all I was looking for.",100,,
688,0.97,3915.845,3920.916,"The initial hearing, we're just trying to get all facts out there in terms of potential Timeline.",100,,
689,0.97,3920.916,3924.654,And the potential work that needs to be done.,100,,
690,0.97,3924.654,3937.833,So it does sound like some of the other things I was hearing from committee members that we would like to see is appraisals of the relevant properties.,100,,
691,0.97,3937.833,3944.34,And potentially getting a subsequent presentation either from central staff or King County.,100,,
692,0.97,3944.34,3949.145,Diving a little bit into those parcels.,100,,
693,0.97,3949.145,3961.824,Councilmember Herbold raised good points regarding those parcels that any action here would probably require a Council waiver of initiative 42.,100,,
694,0.97,3961.824,3968.331,"And I don't know, superintendent, if you can maybe speak to that a little bit.",100,,
695,0.97,3968.331,3978.24,But it's within the power of the Council to wave initiative 42.,100,,
696,0.97,3978.24,3980.109,If they felt it were warranted.,100,,
697,0.97,3980.109,3983.112,"The ordinance does that, Councilmember.",101,,
698,0.97,3983.112,3985.781,The proposed ordinance does wave the provisions of I-4 2.,101,,
699,0.97,3985.781,3989.518,I just wanted to make sure we got that on the record.,102,,
700,0.97,3989.518,3990.052,Superintendent Williams.,102,,
701,0.97,3990.052,3992.355,"Yeah, I was going to echo what Tracy said.",103,,
702,0.97,3992.355,3995.424,I think you have to also hold a public hearing.,103,,
703,0.97,3995.424,3998.694,And public has to be allowed to provide testimony.,103,,
704,0.97,3998.694,4001.731,And that is basically the process.,103,,
705,0.97,4002.631,4003.733,Okay.,104,,
706,0.97,4003.733,4004.033,Thank you.,104,,
707,0.97,4004.033,4009.472,"Before we move on to the next panel, well, there's some questions.",104,,
708,0.97,4009.472,4014.21,"So why don't we go to Councilmember Morales, and then Councilmember Mosqueda.",104,,
709,0.97,4014.21,4014.844,Thank you.,105,,
710,0.97,4014.844,4021.851,I just wanted to reiterate my request.,105,,
711,0.97,4021.851,4024.22,In light of these last few questions.,105,,
712,0.97,4024.22,4033.596,"Chair Lewis, if we can see a Timeline of all of these processes kind of stacked on top of each other to get a better sense of when's the street vacation?",105,,
713,0.97,4033.596,4034.33,When's the review.,105,,
714,0.97,4034.33,4041.704,With or without an appeal just so we have a real sense of what the work will be with this project.,105,,
715,0.97,4041.704,4042.438,That would be great.,105,,
716,0.97,4042.438,4042.938,Thank you.,105,,
717,0.97,4043.606,4046.809,"Thank you, totally concur in that request.",106,,
718,0.97,4046.809,4048.077,I don't know.,106,,
719,0.97,4048.077,4055.651,"Central staff, would you be able to prepare something like that for us?",106,,
720,0.97,4055.651,4055.851,Okay.,106,,
721,0.97,4055.851,4056.085,Great.,106,,
722,0.97,4056.085,4056.419,Thank you.,106,,
723,0.97,4056.419,4057.887,Councilmember Mosqueda.,106,,
724,0.97,4057.887,4060.356,Thank you very much.,106,,
725,0.97,4060.356,4072.334,"Currently, while the city hall Park is in city hands, I believe it's still fenced off along with fourth Avenue which I just saw last week if it hasn't been removed in terms of the fencing.",106,,
726,0.97,4072.334,4078.674,I just wanted to raise my concerns about City Hall parks being fenced off still.,106,,
727,0.97,4078.674,4083.646,"There's concerns about safety and the ability for folks to use the park as it stands, so I wanted to flag that.",106,,
728,0.97,4083.646,4094.29,"And also for the county partners, I assume that when it gets over to the Kownlt, if it gets over to County control, the intent would be to not have it be fenced off.",106,,
729,0.97,4094.29,4099.628,And I know there's mention of activation and open public space.,106,,
730,0.97,4099.628,4101.13,That includes not having a fence.,106,,
731,0.97,4101.13,4108.704,Can you talk a little bit about any resources needed for keeping it an open public space.,106,,
732,0.97,4108.704,4124.053,"And what activation might entail in terms of resources or opportunity for community engagement and for everyone in the city to be able to utilize that and make sure that as well, you know, for folks who need resources and services that we're able to connect people there.",106,,
733,0.97,4124.053,4133.195,Looking for any answer you might have about if the city is needed for our ongoing resources for activation or if you have other thoughts about that type of work.,106,,
734,0.97,4133.195,4153.616,"Yeah, Councilmember, I will take a stab at an initial answer and thanks so much for your question, so yes, we are not planning to keep an open public space fenced off where no one can use it or access it or acquire benefit from it.",107,,
735,0.97,4153.616,4168.163,Our legislation that was passed at Council along with a report that we prepared and delivered at the beginning of the year really requires a robust public engagement process should the county become the owner of the property.,107,,
736,0.97,4168.163,4179.275,"And that would also include the Department of neighborhoods, so the city would remain a strong partner in addressing how best to activate the park.",107,,
737,0.97,4179.275,4188.35,I think we from the county perspective would be really interested in understanding if the city has an activation plan for the park.,107,,
738,0.97,4188.35,4193.455,We have concepts and ideas that were outlined in the report that I Referenced.,107,,
739,0.97,4193.455,4200.095,But we're unclear if the city also has some kind of activation agreement with Stakeholders in the vicinity.,107,,
740,0.97,4200.095,4209.204,So we'd really welcome any previous plan or activation work as a basis for what we could start the conversation on.,107,,
741,0.97,4209.204,4218.981,"Like I--well, I think it was mentioned before that there's an interest to see this be part of the civic campus planning process that was delayed due to Covid.",107,,
742,0.97,4218.981,4226.255,I want to go on the record and say that the county is not planning on leaving Pioneer square.,107,,
743,0.97,4226.255,4228.924,We have a process that will likely restart next month.,107,,
744,0.97,4228.924,4238.167,We will not be able to plan for this parcel if we are not going to assume ownership over it.,107,,
745,0.97,4238.167,4247.409,And we will not be able to begin activation planning and Stakeholder engagement until the transfer goes through.,107,,
746,0.97,4247.409,4249.845,So I hope that provides some initial response.,107,,
747,0.97,4249.845,4257.519,And we'd be happy to talk further with you or anyone on the committee or anyone from the community who might have further questions.,107,,
748,0.97,4257.519,4259.588,"Thank you, very much.",108,,
749,0.97,4262.424,4266.228,And just to jump in on that too.,109,,
750,0.97,4266.228,4281.877,"I think that as we discussed earlier with superintendent Williams and Councilmember Herbold, there was a fairly extensive activation plan and strategy that the Council funded and I believe Pre-Covid it was partially implemented.",109,,
751,0.97,4281.877,4288.517,And then Unfortunely put on hold when Covid came and wiped a lot of our programming out.,109,,
752,0.97,4288.517,4302.498,"But I'm sure that that information is still handy and you know, if you're listening, Councilmember Bagshaw I know you still tune in sometimes to our proceedings.",109,,
753,0.97,4302.498,4311.473,"I'm sure that she would be willing to make herself available to talk about some of those efforts in the past as well, since she was such a big leader on them, so.",109,,
754,0.97,4311.473,4315.477,Mr. Wright do you have a final kind of comment?,109,,
755,0.97,4315.477,4315.811,Sorry.,109,,
756,0.97,4315.811,4318.547,I don't want to jump in if it's final.,109,,
757,0.97,4318.547,4323.786,I just wanted to state that I worked closely with Councilmember Bagshaw.,109,,
758,0.97,4323.786,4328.624,The Park is sitting surrounded by a bunch of County buildings along with other things.,109,,
759,0.97,4328.624,4332.061,We're closely on the activation schedule.,109,,
760,0.97,4332.061,4337.299,We saw as superintendent Williams stated some remarkable success in those things.,109,,
761,0.97,4337.299,4343.172,We don't believe in trying to reinvent something new.,109,,
762,0.97,4343.172,4349.011,But these are resources the county would commit if it was County property.,109,,
763,0.97,4349.011,4349.378,Understood.,110,,
764,0.97,4349.378,4351.413,Thank you for that clarification.,110,,
765,0.97,4351.413,4351.714,All right.,110,,
766,0.97,4351.714,4357.82,"Why don't we go ahead and move on to--sorry, Councilmember Herbold.",110,,
767,0.97,4357.82,4358.287,There you go.,110,,
768,0.97,4358.287,4361.89,Thank you so much.,111,,
769,0.97,4361.89,4362.825,Your action steps.,111,,
770,0.97,4362.825,4370.933,I didn't hear the reference to my observation that perhaps I should phrase differently.,111,,
771,0.97,4370.933,4378.273,So that it is captured as an action step.,111,,
772,0.97,4378.273,4389.485,"I'm Kerped if the objective of the executive that s that the Sepa review result in a DNA, a determination of Nonsignificance.",111,,
773,0.97,4389.485,4400.195,I'm concerned that it should not begin until we have a commitment from the county that they are going to maintain the park as open space.,111,,
774,0.97,4401.363,4422.284,"If we don't have that in place before the DNS begins, then I don't see how we could get--I mean, before the Sepa review begins, I don't see how the Sepa review could possibly result in a DNS determination.",111,,
775,0.97,4423.051,4428.891,"Yeah, I think to your point, you know, Codifying initiative 42 something you asked.",112,,
776,0.97,4428.891,4432.127,You asked a specific question early on.,112,,
777,0.97,4432.127,4433.729,How we codify this thing.,112,,
778,0.97,4433.729,4437.733,Those are I think steps that we will continue to support.,112,,
779,0.97,4437.733,4440.536,Partnership with the city Council and County.,112,,
780,0.97,4440.536,4448.41,So we should--I don't know if the Sepa checklist is something that would daylight this thing.,112,,
781,0.97,4448.41,4469.031,"My questions about the Council determining sort of, you know, what as it relates to I-4 2, if there are areas that we want to adhere to the spirit of I-4 2 while also exempting this project from I-4 2. that's a separate question.",113,,
782,0.97,4469.031,4472.968,Than my question about the Sepa process.,113,,
783,0.97,4472.968,4498.994,"Is the goal of the executive for the Sepa process to result in receiving a DNS, a determination of Nonsignificance, if so, if that is what the executive hopes happens as a result of the Sepa process, shouldn't we get the confirmation from the county that they are going to maintain in Perpetuity the property as park space and open space.",113,,
784,0.97,4498.994,4516.378,"If we don't have that in the front end, I don't see how we can possibly get a DNS as a result of the Sepa review.",113,,
785,0.97,4517.346,4517.913,Superintendent Williams.,113,,
786,0.97,4517.913,4519.915,Do you have an opinion on that.,113,,
787,0.97,4519.915,4520.182,Yeah.,114,,
788,0.97,4520.182,4523.085,I think that's a very clear logic model.,114,,
789,0.97,4523.085,4528.69,"And you know, it's sort of putting the cart before the horse is what you're getting at.",114,,
790,0.97,4528.69,4530.025,And we get it.,114,,
791,0.97,4530.025,4534.229,"And I think in my comment, I might have said DNS.",114,,
792,0.97,4534.229,4539.635,I don't want to presume that that will be the outcome of this process.,114,,
793,0.97,4539.635,4541.803,For the very reasons you highlighted.,114,,
794,0.97,4541.803,4548.477,And it's something that I'll go back and talk to the Mayor's office about.,114,,
795,0.97,4548.477,4554.55,But I just want to acknowledge and recognize that you are raising a concrete point here.,114,,
796,0.97,4554.55,4555.984,I really appreciate that.,115,,
797,0.97,4555.984,4557.185,"Thank you, superintendent.",115,,
798,0.97,4557.185,4560.789,"Mr. chair, I want to add to Councilmember Herbold's point as well.",116,,
799,0.97,4560.789,4563.559,And I saw Kelly with her hand up.,116,,
800,0.97,4563.559,4568.964,I thought I heard her say Alt the beginning that there was an amendment or Addendum that the county was working on.,116,,
801,0.97,4568.964,4576.371,It seems like in terms of Consequencing this that offer or codification perhaps is all ready in place.,116,,
802,0.97,4576.371,4579.808,And I really appreciate what Councilmember Herbold has Teed up adds well.,116,,
803,0.97,4579.808,4588.383,Because we don't want to go down a process of reviewing use if there is a firm commitment for open public space in Perpetuity.,116,,
804,0.97,4588.383,4591.653,Which it sounds like is a shared goal.,116,,
805,0.97,4591.653,4591.92,Yeah.,117,,
806,0.97,4591.92,4596.258,And I'll let Kalie and Tony clarify.,117,,
807,0.97,4596.258,4603.398,But my understanding from their initial presentation is they're trying to get to language that would make those guarantees.,117,,
808,0.97,4603.398,4615.243,"But I think to the Councilmember's point, you know, that language should be--is important in order to complete the Sepa checklist.",117,,
809,0.97,4615.243,4619.848,And I think that those things could be reconciled as an action item.,117,,
810,0.97,4619.848,4629.758,"So I do apologize, Councilmember Herbold, I should have included that as an action item on the list, I understand where you're coming from.",117,,
811,0.97,4629.758,4632.661,But do you have a clarification on that?,117,,
812,0.97,4632.661,4642.537,"More of wanting to affirmatively confirm that yes, we've be having conversations with folks from the community and the immediate vicinity of the park.",118,,
813,0.97,4642.537,4649.011,And have developed the language based on feedback and concerns that we've gotten from those Stakeholders.,118,,
814,0.97,4649.011,4650.679,And that we've heard from the city.,118,,
815,0.97,4650.679,4654.583,And so I do think that there is a shared intent.,118,,
816,0.97,4654.583,4659.621,"And I agree with you Councilmember Lewis, that I think those are Reconcilable.",118,,
817,0.97,4659.621,4665.761,And I believe probably central staff has the language and can share it with all the committee members who are interested.,118,,
818,0.97,4665.761,4667.963,Thanks so much.,118,,
819,0.97,4668.296,4670.265,Thank you.,119,,
820,0.97,4670.265,4670.465,Okay.,119,,
821,0.97,4670.465,4677.906,"If there's no more questions from the county folks, I think we can move to the next panel.",119,,
822,0.97,4677.906,4690.318,But we have a couple more items to consider this Requestion from the county and looking forward to continuing to talk about this potential opportunity.,119,,
823,0.97,4690.318,4693.288,And appreciate you guys making yourself available today.,119,,
824,0.97,4693.288,4703.698,We'll be in touch about the next possible time to maybe drill down into some of the things that were outstanding questions from today.,119,,
825,0.97,4703.698,4707.369,"And you know, I look forward to having you back to talk a little bit more about this.",119,,
826,0.97,4707.369,4709.604,So thank you so much.,119,,
827,0.97,4712.274,4712.741,Okay.,119,,
828,0.97,4712.741,4730.292,So next we have joining us some folks from the Pioneer square neighborhood who also wanted to be included in this discussion and raise some of their thoughts.,119,,
829,0.97,4730.292,4732.194,And would everyone introduce themselves.,119,,
830,0.97,4732.194,4735.597,Just to make sure I have the whole panel here.,119,,
831,0.97,4735.597,4739.668,Maybe starting with Lisa Howard.,119,,
832,0.97,4739.668,4747.109,"And then Lisa, if you're aware of the other Presenters, if you want to just kind of Popcorn introduce yourselves.",119,,
833,0.97,4747.109,4747.843,Until everyone's present.,119,,
834,0.97,4747.843,4749.911,But I'll let you go ahead and start.,119,,
835,0.97,4749.911,4754.783,We have me and Rebecca here today.,120,,
836,0.97,4754.783,4760.355,"Lisa, executive director, and I'm going to hand it over to Rebecca to introduce herself.",120,,
837,0.97,4760.355,4762.858,"Hi everybody, thank you very much.",121,,
838,0.97,4762.858,4771.8,"Councilmember Lewis, for inviting us, and I am the President and Ceo of the Seattle parks foundation.",121,,
839,0.97,4771.8,4775.837,And really excited to be here.,121,,
840,0.97,4775.837,4778.473,And to share perspective.,121,,
841,0.97,4778.473,4779.107,Great.,122,,
842,0.97,4779.107,4795.056,"Well, why don't we go ahead and jump into it and looking forward to hear some of the thoughts--I mean, we heard some thoughts in public comment from some community members in Pioneer square who have some concerns.",122,,
843,0.97,4795.056,4809.471,"And I think it would be good for the committee to hear some of this and get a sense of, you know, how some of those concerns might be mitigated in the event of a transfer or some of the things you guys are thinking about.",122,,
844,0.97,4809.471,4812.24,"So I don't know, Rebecca, if you want to start.",122,,
845,0.97,4812.24,4814.943,Or if Lisa does.,122,,
846,0.97,4814.943,4816.645,But I'm going to turn it over.,122,,
847,0.97,4816.645,4825.52,So you did hear a lot from the community on a number of points that I wanted to speak to today.,123,,
848,0.97,4825.52,4829.424,And much of it was discussed and I'll reiterate.,123,,
849,0.97,4829.424,4836.865,"The park's foundation, our mission is to really partner with community to champion thriving and equitable public spaces.",123,,
850,0.97,4836.865,4859.554,"And we have--we work, in this case, with the Pioneer square community to really think about how can we have a thriving and equitable public space clearly around this Park, it's a very unique park in that it has over 600 residents who are in low income or affordable housing, transitional housing.",123,,
851,0.97,4859.554,4863.291,And they use City Hall park as it's the largest green space.,123,,
852,0.97,4863.291,4869.898,With some of the oldest trees downtown.,123,,
853,0.97,4869.898,4870.232,It's complex.,123,,
854,0.97,4870.232,4872.667,It has a lot of issues.,123,,
855,0.97,4872.667,4874.102,As have been stated.,123,,
856,0.97,4874.102,4875.604,Closing off the park.,123,,
857,0.97,4875.604,4881.843,And transferring the park to another jurisdiction is not going to solve that problem as we've discussed.,123,,
858,0.97,4881.843,4893.889,We have some data from published study from the National Institute of health in similar parks in 48 urban parks and low income neighborhoods where there's significant Unhoused populations.,123,,
859,0.97,4893.889,4908.937,"And it's found that it's not the presence of Unhoused that's the Predictor of safety concerns, it's actually the lack of activation in those parks, reduced lighting, and individuals who are engaged in criminal activity.",123,,
860,0.97,4908.937,4910.872,That reduces positive usage.,123,,
861,0.97,4910.872,4935.697,"So any solution as we discussed today really is to--Whomever has jurisdiction of this park needs to really focus in on activation of the park, engagement in the park, design of the park that's going to ensure effective use and participation.",123,,
862,0.97,4935.697,4941.403,So that is one of the pieces that I think from a park's perspective is really important.,123,,
863,0.97,4941.403,4954.716,"I've talked with Christopher many times about the core success to our parks in Seattle is having a community that fights for their Park, and there is a community here that really believes in fighting for this park.",123,,
864,0.97,4954.716,4960.422,"Occidental Park, which is--used to be in terrible shape several years ago.",123,,
865,0.97,4960.422,4968.73,Was revitalized through efforts of the community and Public- private partnerships such as the urban parks partnership.,123,,
866,0.97,4968.73,4978.74,"That has allowed for Occidental to be transformed with a new pavilion, a playground, a space where people come together, it's funded, activation and art.",123,,
867,0.97,4978.74,4985.68,And it has gone from Intimidating to Iconic.,123,,
868,0.97,4985.68,4992.02,And that's really a Testament to the work of the community and that engagement.,123,,
869,0.97,4992.02,4995.724,The safety incidents in that community are also reduced.,123,,
870,0.97,4995.724,5001.596,The rally and the tapping around City Hall Park is really about ensuring that the community is engaged.,123,,
871,0.97,5001.596,5007.902,And it is the largest green space because--and there was a process underway.,123,,
872,0.97,5007.902,5024.786,"So I would love to ensure that the parks and recreation--the good work that the Seattle parks Department has done with Sdot and others around design and particularly thinking about it as an Ecosystem, city hall Park is not--does not stand alone.",123,,
873,0.97,5024.786,5026.287,There's Prefontaine place.,123,,
874,0.97,5026.287,5029.19,There are the right of ways.,123,,
875,0.97,5029.19,5030.558,The bike lanes.,123,,
876,0.97,5030.558,5040.802,The whole network of neighborhoods and there are nearby adjacent public spaces that are really important for the community to be connected to.,123,,
877,0.97,5040.802,5052.113,"So Whomever has ownership of this Park, it's important to be connected into that Ecosystem, have very strong relationships with the community around.",123,,
878,0.97,5052.113,5055.183,And also be design with that in mind.,123,,
879,0.97,5057.485,5058.853,As per initiative 42.,123,,
880,0.97,5058.853,5082.143,I think I really appreciate Councilmember Herbold really pushing on the--that point--the potential value of this Park is significantly--there is not really an equivalent or better value exchange within the vicinity.,123,,
881,0.97,5082.143,5089.651,And so ensuring that this park remains a park is really critical in this process.,123,,
882,0.97,5089.651,5106.901,"As you look at the land transfer, we're asking that you focus on the language of a Covenant, if it does transfer to King County, it can either stay with city as you said, this is the decision of the Council, you do not have to go forward.",123,,
883,0.97,5106.901,5122.784,"It's also, you know, if you do decide to go forward, then we ask that you do look at a Covenant that ensures in Perpetuity that it is a park, significantly a park for the community.",123,,
884,0.97,5122.784,5127.088,And the community's engaged in that process.,123,,
885,0.97,5127.088,5131.526,The funding for that Park is long-term and focused on activation.,123,,
886,0.97,5131.526,5135.396,And management has an understanding of the diversity of that community.,123,,
887,0.97,5135.396,5139.834,So those are the key points that I wanted to make sure that we talk through.,123,,
888,0.97,5139.834,5142.37,There's other pieces of the puzzle.,123,,
889,0.97,5142.37,5147.275,We have looked at the value of the property.,123,,
890,0.97,5147.275,5153.815,It's significantly higher than what I think has been communicated.,123,,
891,0.97,5153.815,5171.065,And we're also concerned about the potential--some of the property has the are in the transfer could have some environmental issues related to them that will need to be addressed if they are added into park spaces.,123,,
892,0.97,5171.766,5178.239,"So with that, I'm going to hand it over to Lisa.",123,,
893,0.97,5178.239,5180.675,Okay.,124,,
894,0.97,5180.675,5181.075,"Thanks, Rebecca.",124,,
895,0.97,5181.075,5182.81,I've met all of you.,124,,
896,0.97,5182.81,5204.599,"But just a reminder, I'm here to represent the Pioneer square community, the diverse group of Stakeholders, the Pioneer square Bia, and remind you that we work as a community to implement a comprehensive strategic plan to ensure the community works for all members of the community.",124,,
897,0.97,5204.599,5209.571,We do have concerns about the proposed land transfer as listed.,124,,
898,0.97,5209.571,5223.618,We have been in conversations with the county about the proposed language and have questions about just the Legalities and what that means over all.,124,,
899,0.97,5223.618,5227.589,We have participated and led conversations around this area.,124,,
900,0.97,5227.589,5233.027,So we understand the complexities of the history and the urban environment very deeply.,124,,
901,0.97,5233.027,5236.331,The decisions here have real impacts on the community members here.,124,,
902,0.97,5236.331,5245.54,And just a reminder that there's 800 people in either sheltered community housing or affordable housing on these two blocks.,124,,
903,0.97,5245.54,5247.575,Just within Pioneer square.,124,,
904,0.97,5247.575,5258.92,And we look to you to ensure that the actions taken within this land transfer or in the financial operational legal and land use interests of the city of Seattle.,124,,
905,0.97,5258.92,5266.261,We have brought a proposal forward for an alternative path for you to consider.,124,,
906,0.97,5266.261,5284.312,"But I also wanted to--I also wanted to encourage you, if you haven't gone back and watched it, to watch the county council meeting that passed the legislation, if you are considering any sort of Covenant, to ensure that this land is fully legally protected in the long-term.",124,,
907,0.97,5284.312,5295.289,"As well as, I just want to raise in the end--I reviewed the memo that central staff put together.",124,,
908,0.97,5295.289,5298.926,Thank you for being able to raise all of the issues.,124,,
909,0.97,5298.926,5306.634,"But this conversation started with the premise that this property, city hall park was no longer needed for municipal purposes.",124,,
910,0.97,5306.634,5311.072,And it was a surplus in the city's inventory.,124,,
911,0.97,5311.072,5313.207,This is a site of the battle of Seattle.,124,,
912,0.97,5313.207,5319.58,It's the site of one of the--one of our most challenging environments.,124,,
913,0.97,5319.58,5325.52,And it's where our government and community INTERSECTS.,124,,
914,0.97,5325.52,5328.923,And it needs to have that level of consideration given to it.,124,,
915,0.97,5328.923,5333.261,Not just a quick thing.,124,,
916,0.97,5333.261,5336.631,And I'm glad that the process is moving forward.,124,,
917,0.97,5336.631,5339.934,And I hope that it's an Unbiased process.,124,,
918,0.97,5339.934,5345.473,And we're not just looking for determination in Nonsignificance.,124,,
919,0.97,5345.473,5348.342,And I'm happy to answer any questions.,124,,
920,0.97,5349.61,5351.345,Thank you.,125,,
921,0.97,5351.345,5355.316,Do committee members have any questions?,125,,
922,0.97,5357.418,5361.856,"So Rebecca, I have--Oh, Councilmember Morales, go ahead, please.",125,,
923,0.97,5361.856,5376.07,"That's okay, I don't have a question, I just really want to thank Rebecca and Lisa for being here and sharing your deep thoughts and wisdom with us today, thank you.",126,,
924,0.97,5377.839,5400.361,"So Rebecca, in that vain of seeking deep thoughts and wisdom, I'm going to ask you a question regarding some of the proposals that I understand King County has been exploring in partnership with the parks foundation in having conversations around some of the concerns here.",127,,
925,0.97,5400.361,5404.532,And I just wonder if you could maybe provide a bit of an update.,127,,
926,0.97,5404.532,5408.97,"You know, we heard a little bit of that earlier in the county's presentation.",127,,
927,0.97,5408.97,5421.048,And I wonder if you could just jump in and maybe talk about how those have been going and what some of your thoughts are on some of the language being considered?,127,,
928,0.97,5421.048,5421.449,Sure.,128,,
929,0.97,5421.449,5431.259,"You know, I think I haven't seen what was presented to you all from the language other than what's in the memo.",128,,
930,0.97,5431.259,5448.476,And one of our board members has had some lengthy conversations and back and forth with King County around some of the language specifically trying to ensure the park in Perpetuity first and foremost.,128,,
931,0.97,5448.476,5456.15,"And then also having predominant, you know, insuring the natural functions of the park as well.",128,,
932,0.97,5456.15,5464.659,"So the green space, trees, et cetera are preserved as part of the park.",128,,
933,0.97,5464.659,5467.795,There's some dialogue around Jefferson Street as well.,128,,
934,0.97,5467.795,5469.931,And the vacation of that.,128,,
935,0.97,5469.931,5478.639,And recognition that that is--it seems like that is necessary for the county for if they're going to move the entrance.,128,,
936,0.97,5478.639,5481.676,And so those are some of the pieces that I have.,128,,
937,0.97,5481.676,5483.377,That I am aware of.,128,,
938,0.97,5483.377,5489.116,And I know there's--it's sitting right now with the county.,128,,
939,0.97,5489.116,5505.266,So the leaning wag that we have inserted have been mostly around ensuring the long-term preservation of the green space function of the park.,128,,
940,0.97,5505.266,5505.533,For,128,,
941,0.97,5506.3,5511.572,I appreciate you highlighting those priorities.,129,,
942,0.97,5511.572,5520.515,"I think that they're, you know, I don't want to speak for all the members of the committee here today, but I think those are definitely baseline values that we all share.",129,,
943,0.97,5520.515,5537.698,"And it was good to hear from the folks from the county today make some big public assurances that as we go through this process, those are values that they want to highlight as well in terms of their intent moving forward.",129,,
944,0.97,5537.698,5543.704,"So you know, I appreciate those conversations are happening.",129,,
945,0.97,5543.704,5562.423,"Just a quick highlight, I wanted to make sure we talked about Prefontaine place is not included in this transfer, also a very challenging park property.",130,,
946,0.97,5562.423,5566.761,In that it does--park still needs to care for it.,130,,
947,0.97,5566.761,5569.897,"There's still significant issues, criminal activity that happens there.",130,,
948,0.97,5569.897,5572.9,It's also a place where people congregate.,130,,
949,0.97,5572.9,5574.035,And that social aspect is needed.,130,,
950,0.97,5574.035,5582.109,As well as the fourth Avenue bike Lane connection that goes through Dylan way as part of the bicycle master plan.,130,,
951,0.97,5582.109,5583.978,There were concerns when it was put in.,130,,
952,0.97,5583.978,5587.682,But it was sited as critical for the city of Seattle.,130,,
953,0.97,5587.682,5596.424,"And what happens there in the long-term should also be considered as you're considering this, the options within this.",130,,
954,0.97,5598.659,5602.263,Thank you.,131,,
955,0.97,5602.263,5609.236,Does anyone else have a question for the panel here?,131,,
956,0.97,5609.236,5612.573,I do notice Tony has stuck around for this presentation.,131,,
957,0.97,5612.573,5616.043,I don't know if you want to also weigh in a little bit.,131,,
958,0.97,5616.043,5624.652,But I guess I would just be Remiss if I just didn't kind of mention that I'm hearing similar values expressed in terms of vision.,131,,
959,0.97,5624.652,5626.587,Between the panels.,131,,
960,0.97,5626.587,5635.496,"Although, you know, there are certainly Maybe some differences in terms of sequencing.",131,,
961,0.97,5635.496,5639.233,"You know, and who owns the parcel obviously.",131,,
962,0.97,5639.233,5645.306,"But I just wonder if you want to jump in one last time there, Tony.",131,,
963,0.97,5645.306,5645.406,For,131,,
964,0.97,5646.407,5650.077,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",132,,
965,0.97,5650.077,5656.917,"I just--I think both Lisa and Rebecca's comments, they Resonate with us.",132,,
966,0.97,5656.917,5660.621,"We, as we talk about the residents who live there.",132,,
967,0.97,5660.621,5668.429,"We as the county government also live there, we're--Unfortunately, most of the county employees leave at night.",132,,
968,0.97,5668.429,5673.567,But we have a high concentration of that.,132,,
969,0.97,5673.567,5680.975,"But in the discussions, I worked on the negotiations with one of the board members of the parks foundation.",132,,
970,0.97,5680.975,5684.779,That Rebecca was referring to.,132,,
971,0.97,5684.779,5692.787,And I think that we got to language that really captures the essence of it.,132,,
972,0.97,5692.787,5696.557,It's--Uhm--it's going to be operated like a park.,132,,
973,0.97,5696.557,5699.527,And we even talk about operated and maintained.,132,,
974,0.97,5699.527,5703.464,And we talk about retaining the existing landscape features.,132,,
975,0.97,5703.464,5708.602,Including trees and ground cover.,132,,
976,0.97,5708.602,5711.572,This to quote our executive.,132,,
977,0.97,5711.572,5716.21,"It's Ideally, if we use the original opening, it's a front step.",132,,
978,0.97,5716.21,5726.687,"I mean, we want to keep it in that nature if the--if this deal, this transfer happens, you know.",132,,
979,0.97,5726.687,5732.56,So there's--I don't know that your central staff has this language yet.,132,,
980,0.97,5732.56,5737.331,Because it got sent over from our prosecuting attorney to your city attorney.,132,,
981,0.97,5737.331,5740.634,So I don't know if they've got it or not yet.,132,,
982,0.97,5740.634,5755.049,"But I think if they did, in seeing that language, what our proposal is, I think it shows the county's intent, vision, and commitment to keep this property.",132,,
983,0.97,5755.049,5760.154,For the--for the public benefit.,132,,
984,0.97,5760.154,5767.995,And not--I'm actually not--I'm not a very good developer as a facility's manager.,132,,
985,0.97,5767.995,5779.84,"So--but integrating that in, as we think about different things about the activation, I would just close with our part of the city campus master plan.",132,,
986,0.97,5779.84,5782.109,Which our organization is pushing through.,132,,
987,0.97,5782.109,5787.414,We're looking at housing as a big component in any of the locations where we're at.,132,,
988,0.97,5787.414,5797.625,"If you look at the studies, park activation in major cities, bringing that 24 hour presence of residents changes the nature of the neighborhood.",132,,
989,0.97,5797.625,5803.33,"And we're hoping that some of that may be able to be incorporated in our civic campus plan, thank you, Mr.",132,,
990,0.97,5803.33,5806.433,Chair.,132,,
991,0.97,5811.238,5813.274,Is thank you for those remarks.,132,,
992,0.97,5813.274,5817.478,Are there any questions for the panel here from community members? it doesn't appear that there are.,132,,
993,0.97,5818.312,5824.752,"I really appreciate having the opportunity to have--Oh sorry, Lisa, go ahead, yes.",132,,
994,0.97,5824.752,5837.464,I just wanted to do a quick--because I think that we value our work with County over sight and you have an amazingly hard job and you're very good at it.,133,,
995,0.97,5837.464,5840.568,And we appreciate all you've done for the neighborhood and the county employees.,133,,
996,0.97,5840.568,5850.311,I think the premise of our concern doesn't stem from the current conversation with the executive office which we appreciate the opportunity @ to have that back and forth.,133,,
997,0.97,5850.311,5860.621,It really stems from the early sited alternative uses that have come up through the county Council conversations.,133,,
998,0.97,5860.621,5862.356,And they're voting down an amendment of this very thing.,133,,
999,0.97,5862.356,5870.531,"If they would have consider it and accepted it at that point in time, I don't think we would have been having the same conversations at that point.",133,,
1000,0.97,5870.531,5879.873,And it was voted down 5-2. and just ensuring any sort of triple checking.,133,,
1001,0.97,5879.873,5889.383,Because I don't understand the--where between the two entities that legal language has to live to be upheld over time.,133,,
1002,0.97,5889.383,5901.996,For those commitments to truly be held through administrations and time.,133,,
1003,0.97,5901.996,5905.065,Is up utmost importance with this.,133,,
1004,0.97,5905.065,5906.433,If I can reply really quick.,134,,
1005,0.97,5906.433,5910.838,"The mechanism wouldn't be through, my understanding O of how we would approach this.",134,,
1006,0.97,5910.838,5917.111,The mechanism would not be through ordinances or other actions of the two councils.,134,,
1007,0.97,5917.111,5921.515,"But instead, as part of the deed, a Covenant would be placed upon that.",134,,
1008,0.97,5921.515,5925.119,With the city having the ability to enforce that Covenant.,134,,
1009,0.97,5925.119,5930.991,So we would be bound by the very deed to this property.,134,,
1010,0.97,5930.991,5931.258,Forever.,134,,
1011,0.97,5931.258,5944.305,Any changes to that Covenant would require us to go back to the city Council and ask specific affirmative city council action to adjust any such Covenant into the future.,134,,
1012,0.97,5944.305,5948.943,"So that's, I think that's about as strong as we can place on that.",134,,
1013,0.97,5948.943,5957.818,I think that's--that will be a separate recorded document that would be executed if this transfer went forward.,134,,
1014,0.97,5960.187,5963.791,"And then, there's all sorts of people jumping up who are probably attorneys.",134,,
1015,0.97,5963.791,5968.362,"And I'm just an old Army guy, so I'll let them answer that question better.",134,,
1016,0.97,5968.362,6004.765,"Oh boy, don't liable Lish like that.",135,,
1017,0.97,6004.765,6014.541,"We need to keep in mind that even though this is a property owned by the city, it's a property used by this entire neighborhood and community.",136,,
1018,0.97,6014.541,6019.913,Having both of you be here to speak to the implications of this is important as we consider this request from the county.,136,,
1019,0.97,6019.913,6026.82,And we'll continue to keep you involved in our process.,136,,
1020,0.97,6026.82,6035.562,And talk to not only you but the folks called into comment who have concerns as well to make sure that this is a fair open and transparent discussion.,136,,
1021,0.97,6035.562,6039.366,"And Rebecca, did you have a closing remark before we move on?",136,,
1022,0.97,6039.366,6049.543,"Speaks Yeah, it just occurred to me, you know, I think it's really important to recognize the precedent of this conversation.",136,,
1023,0.97,6049.543,6061.855,"And ensure that you all are really taking that to heart and ensuring that, you know, this is a very big and valuable historic piece of property.",136,,
1024,0.97,6061.855,6075.035,"And so when thinking of a transfer like this, you know, remember and consider that, you know, for future, you know, there may be future situations where this could happen again.",136,,
1025,0.97,6075.035,6082.876,"And so Juts wanting to make sure that all your, you know, ts are crossed and is are dotted in the process itself.",136,,
1026,0.97,6082.876,6094.154,And that we're not speeding through it just to ensure the process gets--moves quickly.,136,,
1027,0.97,6094.154,6100.26,The other piece I would say is just the park does need love now.,136,,
1028,0.97,6100.26,6102.029,While this process is going on.,136,,
1029,0.97,6102.029,6113.64,"And so I would encourage you all to, you know, work with the agency to see if there's a way we can get the park open and activated before any land transfers happen.",136,,
1030,0.97,6113.64,6115.843,Otherwise it stays with the fence.,136,,
1031,0.97,6115.843,6118.912,And the community is still without a park.,136,,
1032,0.97,6119.813,6120.848,"Excellent, thank you.",137,,
1033,0.97,6120.848,6121.882,Thank you.,138,,

1054,0.97,6191.118,6195.088,And we like to make sure that the people who actually do the work actually present it.,142,,

1059,0.97,6223.016,6230.991,"During Covid, you know, when things start to close down and start to get tightened up.",142,,
1060,0.97,6230.991,6236.83,"And everything at Seattle center, our, you know, purpose, is to bring people together.",142,,
1061,0.97,6236.83,6244.438,"And when we can't do that, we can't do the things that make Seattle center special and a great place to be.",142,,
1062,0.97,6244.438,6261.655,"The other piece that's been a challenge for us is that as we've been closed down and going through a lot of changes and turmoil, some of our staff have moved on to bigger and and we applaud them . M. - and we thank them for that.",142,,
1063,0.97,6261.655,6267.16,But we lost a few members of our change team as this process has gone on.,142,,
1064,0.97,6267.16,6281.608,"So we're going to talk to you today about what we've done, how we've partnered with different entities to make that work, and we're also going to share with you some of the challenges that we have.",142,,

1076,0.97,6323.016,6331.091,So just want to briefly talk about some of the highlights and throughout this pandemic.,147,,
1077,0.97,6331.091,6340.6,I have to say that the team at Seattle center really rose to the occasion.,147,,
1078,0.97,6340.6,6359.853,The--one of the biggest things that Robert mentioned earlier is that Seattle center responded and delivered a solution to continue with bringing festivals and connecting with the community.,147,,
1079,0.97,6359.853,6382.676,"A virtual studio was created which included having to coordinate rehearsals in the middle of the pandemic, community coordination, technical education, and problem solving to connect festivals to a local and a national and in many cases, an international audience.",147,,
1080,0.97,6382.676,6386.346,Which we were so happy to have.,147,,
1081,0.97,6386.346,6396.656,The other thing is that seal center was happy to partner with the Seattle arts and culture for Anti-Racism.,147,,
1082,0.97,6396.656,6403.363,Which is a consortium of resident organizations on the Seattle center campus.,147,,
1083,0.97,6403.363,6413.373,"The other thing is that we received $100,000 in personal Ppe.",147,,
1084,0.97,6413.373,6420.18,Which we quickly Pivoted from distributing and communicating about programs and events.,147,,
1085,0.97,6420.18,6427.187,"And begin to distribute to staff, to resident works and to patrons.",147,,
1086,0.97,6427.187,6430.724,That were on the campus.,147,,
1087,0.97,6430.724,6434.227,Next slide.,147,,
1088,0.97,6436.93,6452.746,"Some of our other highlights in--and outcomes includes, which Robert also mentioned was our ability to transform our Venues like the exhibition hall.",147,,
1089,0.97,6452.746,6460.42,And the Fisher pavilion into shelters.,147,,
1090,0.97,6460.42,6466.359,We also housed hygiene trailers for 16 months on our campus.,147,,
1091,0.97,6466.359,6478.905,"For eight hours a day, 365 days for 16 months, we provided close to 19,000 showers for an under served community.",147,,
1092,0.97,6478.905,6483.844,We received high accolades from Spu.,147,,
1093,0.97,6483.844,6493.386,Who shared that this was one of their most successful locations that they had throughout the pandemic.,147,,
1094,0.97,6493.386,6502.496,The other thing is we were able to collaborate and partner to host the Rsji summit.,147,,
1095,0.97,6502.496,6509.035,"This year, we had several people on the planning committee.",147,,
1096,0.97,6509.035,6519.346,Which allowed us to be a part of Curating speakers for the different panels.,147,,
1097,0.97,6519.346,6524.184,Developing content and orchestrating and managing the programming flow.,147,,
1098,0.97,6525.952,6542.302,We also had to enlist our internal it team which allowed us to host the event on our Seattle center site.,147,,
1099,0.97,6542.302,6552.012,So we're incredibly proud of that.,147,,
1100,0.97,6552.012,6552.312,Next slide.,147,,
1101,0.97,6552.312,6555.448,"Thank you, Chelsea.",147,,
1102,0.97,6555.448,6570.33,"Seattle center's race on social justice is a prominent commitment throughout Seattle center's strategic business plan, and some key areas include campus.",147,,
1103,0.97,6570.33,6573.767,With new Bipoc campus tenants and collaborators.,147,,
1104,0.97,6573.767,6589.115,And supporting campus resident organizations to advance their equity and inclusion commitments.,147,,
1105,0.97,6589.115,6592.519,"As Robert mentioned, 2021 was a challenging year for all of us.",147,,
1106,0.97,6592.519,6595.221,We had challenges and lessons learned.,147,,
1107,0.97,6595.221,6596.723,I'll make three points.,147,,
1108,0.97,6596.723,6612.605,"One as Robert said t Covid shut down limited the In-Person activities on campus, but it also curtailed our team's ability in some areas including the ability to complete racial equity tool kits.",147,,
1109,0.97,6612.605,6625.151,And it also back Burnerred our culture change program that is focused on dismantling the White supremacy culture in our workplace.,147,,
1110,0.97,6625.151,6636.196,One lesson learned is that when the Covid Telework excitement went into effect that this caused feelings of inequity for front line workers.,147,,
1111,0.97,6636.196,6641.501,That's something we aired and talked about.,147,,
1112,0.97,6641.501,6650.143,Finally we had an unusually high transition with new members coming on.,147,,
1113,0.97,6650.143,6655.915,And many members leaving for primarily career advancements.,147,,
1114,0.97,6655.915,6658.251,We are now focused on rebuilding our team.,147,,
1115,0.97,6658.251,6660.186,And set Agnew Rsj direction.,147,,

1118,0.97,6669.729,6679.406,"So again, another example of how the Seattle center team was able to quickly pivot and transition.",147,,
1119,0.97,6679.406,6689.182,"We as I mentioned earlier, we partnered with--to support the Rsj and host the Rsji summit.",147,,
1120,0.97,6689.182,6703.396,As well as the Mlk unity day celebrations.,147,,
1121,0.97,6703.396,6718.912,We are continuing our virtual studio which allowed us to host the Mayor Harrell for his announcement around the Rsji summit.,147,,

1123,0.97,6727.253,6735.528,Seattle center partnered with Saka to produce the Holistic lunch and safety series.,147,,
1124,0.97,6735.528,6752.612,"Including national speakers, leader, and scholars providing cutting edge dialogue at a moment when SPD was facing Defunding and announcing its reduced capacity to support public events.",147,,
1125,0.97,6753.98,6756.649,And next slide.,147,,
1126,0.97,6761.354,6766.259,. American women were killed by a white terrorist in Atlanta.,147,,
1127,0.97,6766.259,6779.038,The Seattle center Rsji change team held a lunch and learn session to acknowledge and reflect on injuries rising out of the xenophobic Anti-Asian sentiment that rose with Covid- 19 pandemic.,147,,
1128,0.97,6779.038,6784.477,And I will say that it was attended--it was highly attended.,147,,
1129,0.97,6784.477,6788.748,And there was lots of great feedback at that lunch and learn.,147,,
1130,0.97,6788.748,6790.917,We're happy we could produce it.,147,,
1131,0.97,6793.887,6795.455,Next slide.,147,,
1132,0.97,6796.222,6800.76,Our change team members participate in many efforts.,147,,

1135,0.97,6808.434,6822.582,"Were active with the Seattle arts and culture for anti racism, Saca, and again that's the consortium of resident organizations on campus that come together to work on race and social justice together.",147,,
1136,0.97,6822.582,6827.754,We're active with the city wide Rsj team Coleads.,147,,
1137,0.97,6827.754,6834.994,"And as we mentioned before, with supporting the production of the annual summit.",147,,
1138,0.97,6834.994,6837.63,"Next slide, please.",147,,
1139,0.97,6838.598,6845.171,Our team provides resources to continue our Department staff's learning.,147,,

1153,0.97,6916.142,6918.444,There's a lot that's Transitioned.,148,,
1154,0.97,6918.444,6932.158,What I'm most proud of for our Department is the way we were able to pivot from the work that we had planned to do and got into a lot of new things.,148,,
1155,0.97,6932.158,6941.1,We did shelters and hygiene trailers and we had staff dressing issues that came up in Realtime.,148,,
1156,0.97,6941.1,6942.602,We had Online sessions.,148,,
1157,0.97,6942.602,6949.242,We had space for people to share and to commiserate in.,148,,
1158,0.97,6949.242,6955.415,We had space for people to share and to get strength from.,148,,
1159,0.97,6955.415,6966.159,And all of that enabled us to be able to say that we're in a decent place to move forward.,148,,
1160,0.97,6966.159,6982.642,"Even though we didn't do all the things that we had hoped to do and planned to do, Covid doesn't allow you to do some of the things with your organization is basically not allowed to have events.",148,,
1161,0.97,6982.642,6986.946,35 to 40% of them are at home.,148,,

1164,0.97,6998.524,7032.191,"And our primary thing that we're going to be doing is, you know, we do a lot of work to make sure that the change team is whole . The biggest thing we're doing because we got a lot of new change team members and we'll have more new change team members is strengthening the relationship that the change team has with our executive team.",148,,
1165,0.97,7032.191,7037.597,And making sure that those two entities are aligned and working well together.,148,,

1171,0.97,7103.596,7122.248,I believe that we did a good job of that and I look forward to us being able to meet our goals as we go forward but also be able to pivot when things happen and we are trying to throw it into the mix.,149,,
1172,0.97,7122.248,7123.483,That is our presentation.,149,,
1173,0.97,7123.483,7129.589,"With that, I would like to open it up and ask if there any questions.",149,,
1174,0.97,7129.589,7177.37,"Director, thank you so much for that presentation and everyone here on the panel and the team . We really appreciated the highlighting too of the adaptability of the Seattle center campus throughout the Covid crisis and just the ability to really step up and really be a source of providing pace for public health interventions for homelessness sheltering for all of the critical services that we were able to--support for nonprofit and arts organizations, particularly those run by and staffed extensively by Bipoc folks, has been a really great service to the city.",150,,
1175,0.97,7177.37,7188.748,"As the presentation indicates, having a strong and dynamic team able to implement it has been such a great asset for us throughout some of the hardest years the city has ever known.",150,,

1179,0.97,7206.432,7209.368,Seattle center is quite a jewel for us in the city.,151,,
1180,0.97,7209.368,7254.013,"In part, because of the nature of your work, trying to acknowledge and celebrate all the different cultures of the city, you are working with artists and cultural organizations uniquely situated to understand how important this work is . So, part of the work of the folks at OCR, is to support you in understanding this and training and really implementing solutions when you find that there are things that might need some adjusting with either your own culture or all of the practices that you have.",151,,
1181,0.97,7254.013,7261.654,"I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about how you manage, when you have identified an issue.",151,,
1182,0.97,7261.654,7270.196,"For example, you were talking about the stay at home--I forget what we called it.",151,,
1183,0.97,7270.196,7276.636,The additional support and the kind of disparity that there is for front-line workers.,151,,
1184,0.97,7276.636,7289.348,I wonder if you can talk a little bit about how you respond and mitigate or change when you have identified something that is having a disproportionate impact on members of your team.,151,,
1185,0.97,7289.348,7310.87,"Thank you for that question, Councilmember Morales . When we looked at dealing with some of the things that were happening--I am spacing out right now.",152,,
1186,0.97,7310.87,7321.047,One of the things that we do is we have a lot of people on our staff and our change team that starts to ask questions of each other.,152,,
1187,0.97,7321.047,7322.682,Identify something that is coming up.,152,,
1188,0.97,7322.682,7324.717,Our event staff will embrace it.,152,,
1189,0.97,7324.717,7329.388,"We will start to figure out, how do we do this?",152,,
1190,0.97,7329.388,7341.767,"One of the things that we did is we said during Covid, we said we need to have a couple of support teams . We need to have a support team for our front-line staff.",152,,
1191,0.97,7341.767,7358.718,"If we have things that come up, we have a support room to address that . they can go Online, do this . they can do it right away . We also created a support group for our supervisors.",152,,
1192,0.97,7358.718,7364.523,"Supervisors are put in different circumstances, situations, et cetera.",152,,
1193,0.97,7364.523,7373.065,"They need to be able to support their workers . Sometimes if you are supporting your workers, no one is supporting you.",152,,
1194,0.97,7373.065,7388.914,We understand that . We have put together a couple of things . We have two different teams that are working in two different areas of our organizations to make sure that we are being heard.,152,,
1195,0.97,7388.914,7403.629,"On top of that, we have both of those teams at the center and the majority of our staff are still going to be coming to work . They are coming into campus and keeping all of these things working.",152,,
1196,0.97,7403.629,7413.873,They have a Subset of those things working on site to make sure that that happens.,152,,
1197,0.97,7413.873,7423.382,We start to see what is happening in the supervisory realm . We had a lot more things to talk about in the supervisory realm than we did in the front-line staff room.,152,,
1198,0.97,7423.382,7428.521,You are telling us most of the things that are going on.,152,,
1199,0.97,7428.521,7430.656,You are keeping us informed.,152,,
1200,0.97,7430.656,7436.662,We are doing okay for the most part.,152,,
1201,0.97,7436.662,7443.302,"Our supervisors are saying we have a lot of issues because we have staffers at home, staffers here.",152,,
1202,0.97,7443.302,7469.795,"It becomes, in our culture, when somebody has an issue, we want to address it and we want to address it in the way that works for most of us . We want to do that in a way that honors and respects them so that we are not pointing fingers, we are not doing anything but trying to bring people along.",152,,
1203,0.97,7469.795,7489.448,I can't say enough about the way this organization and Jackie and Chelsea and the staff worked to make sure that we not only have their backs but we care about them.,152,,
1204,0.97,7489.448,7490.683,They want to be successful.,152,,
1205,0.97,7490.683,7491.717,We want them to be whole.,152,,

1207,0.97,7502.661,7503.496,Thank you so much.,153,,
1208,0.97,7503.496,7507.566,"Tammy, do you have a follow-up wax Councilmember Morales?",153,,

1219,0.97,7542.334,7546.739,Talk about the new Bipoc campus tenants and collaborators.,159,,
1220,0.97,7546.739,7551.677,I am interested to know how that partnership came about.,159,,
1221,0.97,7551.677,7560.219,"The other item there is about supporting campus resident organizations, advanced equity and inclusion.",159,,
1222,0.97,7560.219,7564.256,I am wondering what forms does that take?,159,,
1223,0.97,7564.256,7566.258,Thank you.,159,,
1224,0.97,7566.258,7574.8,Hopefully--Chelsea and Jackie answered the first question.,160,,
1225,0.97,7574.8,7589.915,We have kind of a multitude of ways that we connect . We have a resident director's meeting that I hold each month . We bring all of the resident directors together.,160,,
1226,0.97,7589.915,7619.411,We talk through issues . We share concerns . We present what we know is going on and then each resident director will present from their point of view what they were doing and what--we want to get all of that into the same room.,160,,
1227,0.97,7619.411,7652.945,"The more we are able to communicate openly, honestly, and directly, the better we can work together and move things along . The second piece of that, our monthly resident director's meeting, the group that we mentioned . The Seattle center stack up, they have a standing part in that meeting to raise race and social justice issues, issues on policing, whatever.",160,,
1228,0.97,7652.945,7661.42,They have a forum that allows them to have space in that meeting with us on a monthly basis.,160,,
1229,0.97,7661.42,7675.701,"Then, as they develop programs and/or things to work on or to work with, they will have activities, et cetera.",160,,
1230,0.97,7675.701,7684.076,They have a separate invitation list that brings folks together to talk.,160,,
1231,0.97,7684.076,7691.383,It is not just resident directors but actual staff talking to actual staff.,160,,
1232,0.97,7691.383,7697.256,"The first question, Jackie or Chelsea, could you take that one?",161,,
1233,0.97,7697.256,7738.063,"I think you addressed the partnerships with resident organizations . The partnerships with new Bipoc campus tenants and new collaborators was a prominent goal in our strategic plan . We are midway through the 2021 to 2023 period of our strategic plan . As we all have been returning to the workplace and Seattle center has been opening up and we have been Reactivating programming, we are having more and more opportunities to work on this goal.",162,,
1234,0.97,7738.063,7740.032,We have a bit of a slow start on that.,162,,
1235,0.97,7740.032,7742.634,"Chelsea, anything you would like to add to that?",162,,
1236,0.97,7742.634,7770.896,"Both of you said it all . As we are going into the new year, we realize that our resident organizations went through this pandemic with us . of course, they are working and struggling to get back to 100% . one of our primary goals is to incorporate everything that we do, figure out a way to involve them.",163,,
1237,0.97,7770.896,7783.709,"As you are growing and building and coming back, we are recognizing that we are not moving at it alone but trying to support each other.",163,,
1238,0.97,7783.709,7818.243,"If I could add, Chelsea is very engaged and passionate about bringing Bipoc people and different resources to the campus so that our whole community can take full advantage of the grounds and the events and the spaces at Seattle center.",164,,
