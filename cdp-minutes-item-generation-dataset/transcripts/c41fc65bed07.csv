19,0.97,176.142,180.513,Hello I am Karina Bull.,2,,
20,0.97,180.513,189.289,I have a short presentation about CB 120172 known as the third quarter employment organs.,2,,
21,0.97,189.289,201.434,The Seattle Department of human resources submit four bills a year to legislate personnel action that require Council approval.,2,,
22,0.97,201.434,212.845,In this particular instance it would return 13 positions to the civil service position and amend five job classification titles.,2,,
23,0.97,212.845,229.062,To give you an idea of what positions would be impacted I will pull up the memo . Here you can see charts with those positions.,2,,
24,0.97,229.062,237.37,There are 13 positions a crossed eight Department.,2,,
25,0.97,237.37,238.171,And two are vacant.,2,,
26,0.97,238.171,247.447,The Seattle Department of human resources reviews whether jobs should have a civil service protections.,2,,
27,0.97,247.447,250.35,Upon the request of the Department you may notice that the job duties have changed.,2,,
28,0.97,250.35,259.192,And no longer meet the criteria for being exempt or perhaps it was a new position that was added during the budget.,2,,
29,0.97,259.192,271.671,And when positions are added in the budget they are not always able to be reviewed by human resources to have that determination of whether or not civil service protections are appropriate.,2,,
30,0.97,271.671,279.812,As a reminder civil service protections exist for 90% of the city's workforce.,2,,
31,0.97,279.812,302.035,"And those automatically provide employees with a number of protections including hiring, promotions, Probationary period, opportunities to correct Erformance and only termination if there is cause.",2,,
32,0.97,302.035,308.141,It does enable a lot of job security and financial stability for employees.,2,,
33,0.97,308.141,316.949,The next piece of legislation would amend classification titles for five positions.,2,,
34,0.97,316.949,326.125,"These are police communication Dispatchers, they are being transferred to the community safety communication center.",2,,
35,0.97,326.125,331.097,And that classification title is no longer appropriate.,2,,
36,0.97,331.097,342.408,They would be renamed 911 emergency communication Dispatchers.,2,,
37,0.97,342.408,343.476,You will see those titles there.,2,,
38,0.97,343.476,346.045,For both of these changes there would be no direct cost associated.,2,,
39,0.97,346.045,349.482,I have noted the equity and racial impact.,2,,
40,0.97,349.482,368.067,The this includes eliminating institutional structural barriers to Detracting employees to apply for jobs and retaining those employees in enabling opportunities for employment success and career growth.,2,,
41,0.97,368.067,394.227,According to the city workforce we see that Bipoc women are not as calm as.,2,,
42,0.97,394.227,409.442,In this would be an effort to remove the barriers for career growth for Bipoc individuals.,2,,
43,0.97,409.442,412.745,Many these are a strategic adviser positions that are unique . same as managers.,2,,
44,0.97,412.745,421.954,Where they can have protections or be exempt from civil service protections.,2,,
45,0.97,421.954,424.257,Depending on the type of work that they do.,2,,
46,0.97,424.257,430.029,It is a broader range of work that they can do.,2,,
47,0.97,430.029,432.832,So Seattle Department of human resources has noted for employees seeking mobility.,2,,
48,0.97,432.832,451.284,The first place they will go would be a strategic adviser position Pixel ways to create more financial stability and job security for those positions could increase the diversity of candidates applying.,2,,
49,0.97,451.284,452.151,That concludes my presentation.,2,,
50,0.97,452.151,462.595,Are there any questions?,2,,

83,0.97,755.688,761.594,The city of Seattle places a high premium on that.,7,,
84,0.97,761.594,766.665,For all those reasons that is why I would like to be reappointed.,8,,

90,0.97,803.335,811.744,We are at the center of making sure that we have access to the best auditing practices.,9,,
91,0.97,811.744,821.954,You have an incredible workload related to the good Governance practices.,9,,
92,0.97,821.954,830.963,As you framed it these help the city council fulfill the oversight of function and role as a legislative body for the city of Seattle.,9,,
93,0.97,830.963,842.241,"I wanted to ask quickly, there is a lot of work that you do.",9,,
94,0.97,842.241,846.278,There are 108 implemented recommendations that your office has issued to executive departments.,9,,
95,0.97,846.278,860.993,And I am wondering how you would help the executive and legislative branches understand your recommendations and how you would sequence implementation of those recommendations.,9,,
96,0.97,860.993,874.306,Some of them are probably more contemporary and current than others.,9,,
97,0.97,874.306,882.514,I'm wondering how we can create an opportunity to get higher compliance with implementation of your recommendations.,9,,
98,0.97,882.514,884.516,"Thank you, that is an excellent question.",10,,
99,0.97,884.516,899.698,I think the key is that they have to make sense we have to develop a recommendation that makes sense and I will say that we have been blessed in the city of Seattle.,10,,
100,0.97,899.698,900.266,A large percentage.,10,,
101,0.97,900.266,905.137,70% made the 788 recommendation since 2007.,10,,
102,0.97,905.137,906.739,And 70% of them have been implemented.,10,,
103,0.97,906.739,916.315,One of the keys is that we try to work hard with the Department.,10,,
104,0.97,916.315,922.121,We don't want to make you look bad.,10,,
105,0.97,922.121,925.357,We want you to look as good as possible and avoid as many risks as you can.,10,,
106,0.97,925.357,932.531,And what we have tried to do is be open and transparent and focus on not trying to be got you auditors.,10,,
107,0.97,932.531,933.465,To be helpful.,10,,
108,0.97,933.465,940.673,And that is the key to keep crafting recommendations.,10,,
109,0.97,940.673,948.781,Departments say that makes sense and that's going to help us avoid a problem.,10,,
110,0.97,948.781,957.556,And the fact that we keep following up until it makes sense so the recommendation is implemented.,10,,
111,0.97,957.556,971.203,It doesn't make sense we did a series of reports looking at the city navigation team that no longer exists.,10,,
112,0.97,971.203,974.073,But was a tool that was being used to deal with Unsanctioned Encampments.,10,,
113,0.97,974.073,986.719,And reports on that team . When it was Un-Banded it didn't make any sense to follow those recommendations so we set those aside.,10,,
114,0.97,986.719,989.588,It is knowing when to set it aside.,10,,
115,0.97,989.588,997.196,It doesn't make sense sometimes it changes.,10,,
116,0.97,997.196,1000.232,We call it a red.,10,,
117,0.97,1000.232,1002.701,We will not implement a recommendation that will lower the score.,10,,
118,0.97,1002.701,1005.137,It does makes sense.,10,,
119,0.97,1005.137,1007.406,I don't know if that answer the question.,10,,
120,0.97,1007.406,1018.25,I think by following up and pursuing it until it is closed implemented or doesn't make sense to pursue it.,10,,
121,0.97,1018.25,1024.823,I would say that a lot are pending.,10,,
122,0.97,1024.823,1026.825,What we are is suggesting they cannot do overnight.,10,,
123,0.97,1026.825,1032.164,It takes time for them to do it.,10,,
124,0.97,1032.164,1033.399,There are resource constraints.,10,,
125,0.97,1033.399,1035.367,And trying to get some of the changes made.,10,,
126,0.97,1035.367,1037.669,We understand that.,10,,
127,0.97,1037.669,1043.575,And that is why we do the follow-up we say we're going check back in one year.,10,,
128,0.97,1043.575,1050.382,Unless we get a request from counsel we will give them a year.,10,,
129,0.97,1050.382,1054.286,Because it often takes that long to fully implement the change.,10,,
130,0.97,1054.286,1061.66,"So I don't know if that answer the question or not, chair Gonzalez?",10,,
131,0.97,1061.66,1071.77,"Yes, that is a helpful response.",11,,
132,0.97,1071.77,1082.815,This counsel has focused on process improvements including funding and new revenue sources to increase the amount of affordable housing.,11,,
133,0.97,1082.815,1088.32,And other types of development that can occur to increase housing choices across the city.,11,,
134,0.97,1088.32,1094.927,And we are joined by the chair of the Land-Use committee.,11,,
135,0.97,1094.927,1132.965,And one of the questions I have is related to complex code enforcement . I was wondering if based on your experience in auditing whether or not you have observations now that you would be interested in working on for your next term to help the city council identify ways that you could streamline services in that area.,11,,
136,0.97,1132.965,1147.346,We hear from Childcare providers and affordable housing providers that can come up the system in a way that results in results and cost.,11,,
137,0.97,1147.346,1151.85,And SLOWS production with the amenities we want to create within our neighborhoods.,11,,
138,0.97,1151.85,1154.486,"To answer the question, chair Gonzalez.",12,,
139,0.97,1154.486,1163.095,We are always delighted to look at something that the public and executive is interested in.,12,,
140,0.97,1163.095,1171.47,I think that is an area that we haven't looked at in great depth.,12,,
141,0.97,1171.47,1175.374,I have been here long enough that I have dust on my shoulders.,12,,
142,0.97,1175.374,1184.883,There have been a series of studies to expedite housing.,12,,
143,0.97,1184.883,1194.626,Which is such a challenging issue for those of us in the Seattle.,12,,
144,0.97,1194.626,1202.801,We would want to sit down with counsel and figure out what makes sense and how we can add value in it.,12,,
145,0.97,1202.801,1217.049,We have in looked at that in a while but that is something that we may benefit from bringing in an independent lens.,12,,
146,0.97,1217.049,1256.688,Our neighbors to the South have done a better job as it relates to streamlining those services and I continue to hear from housing developers and facility owners that there is a significant need in reducing bureaucracy to expedite the process of those amenities that we want to see created . do I have any other questions or comments on auditor Jones and his reappointment?,13,,
147,0.97,1256.688,1258.29,I do not see any hands raised.,13,,
148,0.97,1258.29,1260.659,To go ahead with the appointment.,13,,
149,0.97,1260.659,1267.699,And I move that the committee recommend confirmation of appointment 02033.,13,,
150,0.97,1267.699,1268.5,Do I have a second.,13,,
151,0.97,1268.5,1273.805,It has been moved and Seconded.,13,,
152,0.97,1273.805,1276.775,To Reappoint David Jones as the city auditor.,13,,
153,0.97,1276.775,1278.877,Any additional comments?,13,,
154,0.97,1278.877,1298.797,"Hearing none, will the clerk call the role? Vice-Chair Juarez Ms. Mosqueda Mr.",13,,
155,0.97,1298.797,1306.138,"Strauss Ms. Sawant, chair Gonzalez.",13,,

179,0.97,1468.533,1485.217,And as I said earlier I am pleased to note that 70% of nearly 800 recommendations that we made since 2007 have been implemented by the city departments and we take pride that we have been able to come up with that.,16,,
180,0.97,1485.217,1504.703,And as noted I am proud that we continue the Long-Standing practice of thinking through the potential racial and social justice implications of the Audits.,16,,
181,0.97,1504.703,1509.441,This helps us plan our work and keep our eye on issues that need to be raised.,16,,
182,0.97,1509.441,1512.911,"Including diversity, equity, and inclusion.",16,,
183,0.97,1512.911,1522.554,One of the great things that has happened as a tool was adopted by other auditor offices around the country.,16,,
184,0.97,1522.554,1527.759,These are some of the highlights since 2020.,16,,
185,0.97,1527.759,1542.741,The first bullet that you can see was bridge maintenance that was requested by Councilmember Pedersen.,16,,

194,0.97,1613.845,1615.914,We came up with a recommendation and that report for improvement.,16,,
195,0.97,1615.914,1629.928,I should note that the implementation of some of those recommendations that have not been implemented will fall upon the King County regional Homeles authority to consider whether or not they want to implement those recommendations.,16,,
196,0.97,1629.928,1632.931,That is something to watch.,16,,
197,0.97,1632.931,1648.747,The second report in 2020 was a response from Councilmember Herbold.,16,,

202,0.97,1690.021,1703.902,And in the report regarding surveillance technology we may 20 recommendations on how that could be improved.,16,,
203,0.97,1703.902,1716.548,If there's anyone else in the viewing public that wants more information about all the stuff we did in 2020 you can look at the annual report on Governance and education committee under the city auditor and annual reports.,16,,

206,0.97,1738.87,1741.539,One thing I had to emphasize is that this is a living document.,16,,
207,0.97,1741.539,1742.74,It is not fixed in stone.,16,,
208,0.97,1742.74,1746.778,We want to remain flexible and take on emerging topics of interest to the counsel.,16,,

212,0.97,1783.414,1788.787,A lot of our stuff is directed and requested by counsel.,16,,
213,0.97,1788.787,1794.926,And I've been very fortunate through my years.,16,,
214,0.97,1794.926,1797.996,The stuff that we have been asked to do is been the good things.,16,,
215,0.97,1797.996,1803.301,And that has made our life a lot easier.,16,,

243,0.97,2000.231,2003.334,And some may say why are you looking at this and not the inspector general.,16,,
244,0.97,2003.334,2008.439,The reason why is because it is the Department of finance and administrative services that is responsible for purchasing city vehicles.,16,,
245,0.97,2008.439,2010.508,Including police vehicles.,16,,
246,0.97,2010.508,2016.481,And that is why it is under our Purview.,16,,

257,0.97,2086.984,2111.642,And we made recommendations in there that Councilmember Herbold thought would be useful because it benefit 20 Committee- based organizations.,16,,

268,0.97,2175.406,2191.756,Idea is that we want to keep youth out of the criminal justice system because all of the research we have is that when you have folks in the criminal justice system that on average it doesn't lead to a good outcome.,16,,
269,0.97,2191.756,2194.525,If we can prevent that from happening that is a good thing.,16,,
270,0.97,2194.525,2200.331,The city got a grant from the U.S. Institute of justice.,16,,
