60,0.97,358.191,369.669,We were able to add rapid acquisition of housing to the priority list because we know so many cities across our state will benefit.,15,,

94,0.97,565.331,582.248,This clerk file would designate facial recognition technology as a surveillance technology subject to the documentation and reviews outlined in the surveillance ordinance.,17,,

98,0.97,596.662,600.967,Just a little bit of background on this clerk file.,17,,
99,0.97,600.967,618.484,In a recent OPA investigation the OPA concluded that clear view ai did not meet the definition of surveillance technology.,17,,
100,0.97,618.484,635.568,"Because--the OPA director concluded that they did not meet the definition, the officer who was found to be using that technology could not be determined to be acting outside of policy or law.",17,,
101,0.97,635.568,641.24,I--disagreed that the particular technology was not covered by the ordinance.,17,,
102,0.97,641.24,660.626,Chief Diaz as well wrote to the Council that--SPD's approved Tech guess under the surveillance ordinance we do not have any plans.,17,,
103,0.97,660.626,677.176,The chief went on to say that he reiterated that the SPD did not use clear view ai and had no intention of using clear view ai and he was committed to upholding the ordinance and the civil liberties of our residence.,17,,
104,0.97,677.176,681.781,The business product is at odds with those two central priorities.,17,,
105,0.97,681.781,706.605,"With clerk file being introduced today as a precaution to ensure facial technology--facial recognition technology will be subject to the process outlines, again we will be considering this next Monday on July 26th.",17,,
106,0.97,706.605,708.307,Other.,17,,
107,0.97,708.307,724.724,-- food security has ban top concern as the crisis created by the pandemic dramatically increased the number of households struggling to put food on the tables.,17,,
108,0.97,724.724,749.982,"The city joined partners across King County to increase investments and Pivot the work of some employees to focus on increasing food related services and they focus particularly on residents disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and economic downturn including older adults, low-income children and families, communities of color, immigrants, refugees and unsheltered individuals.",17,,
109,0.97,749.982,765.631,They redeployed more than 60 applies from H--employees to work on--from Hsd to work on meal programs.,17,,
110,0.97,765.631,778.077,In the first year more than one million meals were provided at over 40 shelters thanks to partnerships with operation sack lunch.,17,,
111,0.97,778.077,814.079,Older adults through King County received almost one million meals for more than 50 meal sites and programs through home delivery and pick up and I--just want to take this opportunity to thank Hsd employees and their many community partners who have helped families put food on the tables during this period of time and having this sort of sum up from a human services Department on all the really critical work that they have been doing over the last year on food security issues.,17,,
112,0.97,814.079,829.228,"Just so Council members who are not on the public safety and human services committee aware, last week the committee voted 4-1 to move legislation restricting the use of less lethal weapons to the full council.",17,,
113,0.97,829.228,833.599,Judge Robert who oversees the decree has called for a status conference on August 10th.,17,,
114,0.97,833.599,851.55,We don't know what the subject of that status conference is but never the less I moved to hold off on a full council vote until after that date so August 16th is the first Council meeting after that date.,17,,
115,0.97,851.55,860.726,"Again this is to up sure if the ordinance is discussed, we will have the benefit of that discussion.",17,,

119,0.97,902.668,914.213,It notes that the Department has also launched new--a new arrest dash board that shows arrest data.,17,,
120,0.97,914.213,923.555,The import of limitation on the data that they note is that the stop data is confined to Terry stops.,17,,
121,0.97,923.555,943.742,You may recall that--the Council adopted a statement of legislative intent in the budget process last year seeking fulfillment of what is now a four year legal obligation from the bias free policing ordinance to include data from all traffic stops.,17,,
122,0.97,943.742,950.683,This has not been done for the past four years so the Council did pass this slide.,17,,
123,0.97,950.683,955.854,I did discuss this issue most recently with the chiefs office a few weeks ago.,17,,
124,0.97,955.854,967.9,"Again this cat we are getting from the Senate for police equity report is limited, confined to data on Terry stops.",17,,

500,0.97,4066.228,4072.201,There are no items on today's city council agenda from the rights committee.,35,,
501,0.97,4072.201,4081.51,At last Thursday's committee meeting there were four appointments to the green new deal over sight board that the committee voted to recommend confirmation off.,35,,
502,0.97,4081.51,4088.517,However because the committee was after 12:00 noon on a Thursday those items will Bonn next week's council meeting agenda.,35,,
503,0.97,4088.517,4097.359,The meeting of the committee--the next meeting is scheduled for its regular time Tuesday July 27th at 2:00 P.M.,35,,

506,0.97,4116.745,4125.521,As I have informed the committee before this bill was originally requested by the city of Seattle Renters Commission.,35,,
507,0.97,4125.521,4162.291,I will also hope that we will be able to vote at the next meeting on the legislation requiring landlords to provide relocation assistance when they replace their tenants with outrageous--[Indiscernible] the reality is its a very important bill.,35,,
508,0.97,4162.291,4174.97,According to data compiled by the regional Council's transportation survey there are some neighborhoods in Seattle where over 35% of people move for displacement related reasons which is overwhelmingly because of rent increases.,35,,

515,0.97,4234.196,4239.034,This data from the regional Council is extremely important.,35,,
516,0.97,4239.034,4250.212,It conforms what housing advocates and Renter rights advocates including the attorneys who defend the tenants from Evictions have pointed out repeatedly this is what is happening.,35,,
517,0.97,4250.212,4258.787,We know that many of these end up also becoming cases of homelessness according to studies.,35,,
518,0.97,4258.787,4265.661,It shows every dollar increase in the average rent in the city results in a 15% increase in homelessness.,35,,
519,0.97,4265.661,4272.368,And just wanted to share with the city council here that in the committee we have had many discussions on both these bills.,35,,

526,0.97,4329.191,4342.805,I want to remind several years ago the people's budget fought for and won a budget amendment to fund establishing a safe consumption site in Seattle and the Mayor has refused to spend those funds.,35,,

528,0.97,4361.423,4376.438,He notes in 1969 the city forced the new hope church and black middle class homeowners in this very area to sell their land under the threat of imminent domain.,35,,
529,0.97,4376.572,4406.335,[Indiscernible] this called renewed project was referred to as the urban renewal project.,35,,
530,0.97,4406.335,4420.382,"Under that program the central district black community was labeled as quote on quote home to the color, the poor t ignorant t unfortunate, the undesirable, the weak t Undeserving poor end quote.",35,,
531,0.97,4420.382,4436.632,And city officials as I mentioned used the threat of imminent DOE--forced the church and neighboring homeowners to sell their property.,35,,
532,0.97,4436.632,4450.279,In other words the cities political establishment committed a stunning outrage and egregious theft of black resources and legalized racist outlining and Gentrification.,35,,
533,0.97,4450.279,4451.914,I apologize for my dog barking.,35,,
534,0.97,4451.914,4480.142,As I explained my office is working with other pastors of other black churches on a resolution calls out how the Atlantic urban renewal--[Indiscernible] my office has been reviewing the documents about that racist program which is one of the many ways the black community members have been Simmsmatically pushed out of the the central area.,35,,
535,0.97,4480.142,4489.918,At the very least the city needs to fund new hope family housing project as one step towards preventing central area displacement.,35,,
536,0.97,4489.918,4508.57,The resolution will also make clear the movement one funding explicitly for Anti-Displacement affordable housing in the central area particularly one by the act activism of the new hope Baptist church.,35,,
537,0.97,4508.57,4529.925,That funding will be available starting next year and the office of Housin should prepare for that funding but including it in the notice of funding availability published this fall the resolution will also make clear the city council's intention to do that.,35,,
538,0.97,4529.925,4546.408,The charge in partnership with the low-income housing--as developed a plan for the new hope family housing project to build affordable housing for 87 households with community preference for people who have been displaced or are threatened with displacement.,35,,
