370,0.97,1809.107,1821.586,I am calling to join the chorus of people saying to divest from SPD by at least 50%.,64,,
371,0.97,1821.586,1823.888,"Stop Criminalizing homelessness, poverty, mental illness and substance abuse troubles.",64,,
372,0.97,1823.888,1827.492,Expand the duress defense and the ordinance.,64,,
373,0.97,1827.492,1836.234,"Considering 90% of cases qualify for a public defender and we are spending millions on a racist policing system, it polices the poor.",64,,
374,0.97,1836.234,1839.837,We are putting so much into these awful Sweeps.,64,,
375,0.97,1839.837,1844.142,We are increasing the trauma in our communities.,64,,
376,0.97,1844.142,1847.545,We are increasing the instability.,64,,
377,0.97,1847.545,1862.227,Plenty of the funds should be able to be reallocated into programs that are interested in real public safety and housing.,64,,
378,0.97,1862.227,1864.462,These are ways to help people get out of the cycle.,64,,
379,0.97,1864.462,1865.663,"Thank you, I yield my time.",64,,
380,0.97,1865.663,1867.265,Thank you for calling in this morning.,65,,
381,0.97,1867.265,1872.971,I want to just check to see if Julia is with us.,65,,
382,0.97,1872.971,1874.172,"Okay, I see Valerie is with us.",65,,
383,0.97,1874.172,1874.772,Good morning Valerie.,65,,
384,0.97,1874.772,1875.44,Good morning.,66,,
385,0.97,1875.44,1876.441,My name is Valerie.,66,,
386,0.97,1876.441,1887.785,I live in district two . I am speaking to the proposal to begin the process to establish an elected community of the oversight board.,66,,
387,0.97,1887.785,1890.321,We need an accountability system that is transparent and independent.,66,,
388,0.97,1890.321,1906.904,We need voters who pay for it and are impacted by it.,66,,
389,0.97,1906.904,1908.106,This is about value for money.,66,,
390,0.97,1908.106,1909.741,It is mostly about fairness and democracy.,66,,
391,0.97,1909.741,1912.01,The present office of police accountability is within the police Department.,66,,
392,0.97,1912.01,1913.544,The majority of its investigators are public prosecutors.,66,,
393,0.97,1913.544,1916.914,The general public does not know what it does because it's operations and outcomes are not opaque.,66,,
394,0.97,1916.914,1921.92,City residents pay for the police Department and we pay for the current accountability system.,66,,
395,0.97,1921.92,1923.488,It is not delivering consequences and transparency.,66,,
396,0.97,1923.488,1929.227,It is not creating the different types of policing that we want and need.,66,,
397,0.97,1929.227,1936.934,Thank you.,66,,
398,0.97,1936.934,1937.935,Thank you very much.,67,,

413,0.97,1998.296,2010.975,We should not be Criminalizing people and putting them in jail for crimes of survival.,68,,
414,0.97,2012.577,2019.417,We absolutely need to rethink the way that we treat our neighbors and the way that we think of safety and the way that we have privileged people that are comfortable.,68,,
415,0.97,2019.417,2022.687,Thank you Laura for being here on behalf of so many.,69,,

419,0.97,2055.753,2059.056,I would like to ask the city Council to divest from the police department by 50%.,70,,
420,0.97,2059.056,2063.528,Stop wasting money on resources and stop prosecuting people who are living in poverty and experiencing mental health struggles and drug use.,70,,

422,0.97,2069.434,2070.635,We need to get it together.,70,,

438,0.97,2134.999,2139.437,Thank you for being here.,74,,
439,0.97,2139.437,2145.443,I am here to echo a lot of the other comments that I ever heard about Defunding the police and community investment.,74,,
440,0.97,2145.443,2153.851,I would like to echo the call to extend the duress defense and expand the ordinance.,74,,
441,0.97,2153.851,2156.354,I think we can all agree that these are about Prioritizing human rights.,74,,
442,0.97,2156.354,2163.261,I had the chance to sit in a public courthouse once.,74,,
443,0.97,2163.261,2176.641,"Just seeing how many convictions were really about nonviolent and pretty small things, it really shook me.",74,,
444,0.97,2176.641,2182.28,It made me really care about just having the opportunity to recognize in a judicial way that we can just let these petty things go.,74,,
445,0.97,2182.28,2191.889,Thank you.,74,,
446,0.97,2191.889,2192.89,Thank you very much.,75,,

451,0.97,2212.61,2213.411,It is 10:13 A.M.,75,,
452,0.97,2213.411,2215.413,Let's move on to the items listed on the agenda.,75,,
453,0.97,2215.413,2218.816,Please read item one to the record.,75,,
454,0.97,2218.816,2220.918,Community safety and violence prevention for briefing and discussion.,76,,
455,0.97,2220.918,2221.719,Thank you very much.,77,,
456,0.97,2221.719,2222.587,"Madam clerk, welcome back.",77,,
457,0.97,2222.587,2225.59,I see alley with us.,77,,
458,0.97,2225.59,2226.824,You want to kick us off today?,77,,
459,0.97,2226.824,2237.301,"Thank you, good morning.",78,,
460,0.97,2242.907,2245.91,I think you summarized what is coming up for the rest of the day today.,78,,
461,0.97,2245.91,2247.144,You highlighted the upcoming deadline.,78,,
462,0.97,2247.144,2248.98,I do not think I need to add to that.,78,,
463,0.97,2248.98,2252.817,I will turn it over to another individual to kick off the discussion on community safety and violence.,78,,
464,0.97,2252.817,2254.051,"Thank you so much, welcome back.",79,,
465,0.97,2254.051,2255.152,Good morning Council members.,80,,
466,0.97,2255.152,2258.089,"As Allie mentioned, we will talk about community safety and violence prevention this morning.",80,,
467,0.97,2258.089,2260.558,You will be hearing a lot from me today in this presentation.,80,,
468,0.97,2260.558,2272.737,I would like to note that the other central staffers that were part of the team are also on the call to answer your questions as needed.,80,,
469,0.97,2272.737,2278.976,So I will start with setting out to the frame of the memo and how we approached it so that you have context for what we will be talking about.,80,,
470,0.97,2278.976,2285.082,"We used as our foundation, the resolution that the council passed over the summer 31962.",80,,
471,0.97,2285.082,2288.085,This evidenced an attempt to create a Department of community safety and violence prevention.,80,,
472,0.97,2288.085,2304.535,"Úand one of the things in that resolution to move forward, in a work plan is to recommend a structure and function for that Department.",80,,
473,0.97,2304.535,2305.836,So this memo starts along this path.,80,,
474,0.97,2305.836,2317.815,This is in terms of identifying what happens when the public interfaces with law enforcement in the context of calls for public service.,80,,
475,0.97,2317.815,2319.283,"So essentially, this is 911 calls.",80,,
476,0.97,2319.283,2321.485,It deals with how the city and county response to those calls.,80,,
477,0.97,2321.485,2323.22,"So, we will go through and intercept model.",80,,
478,0.97,2323.22,2324.922,We will get into this in a little bit.,80,,
479,0.97,2324.922,2332.83,This is how we framed the criminal legal system.,80,,
480,0.97,2332.83,2336.734,"And, I will just note that there are a variety of different departments that are implicated in community safety.",80,,
481,0.97,2336.734,2338.736,This paper does not go into them in real depth.,80,,
482,0.97,2338.736,2345.643,The budgets for each of the departments are addressed either in the miscellaneous paper or in the Department specific papers that you have seen thus far or they are coming the rest of today.,80,,
483,0.97,2345.643,2351.549,So we can move to the next slide.,80,,
484,0.97,2351.549,2352.55,You will see this here.,80,,
485,0.97,2352.55,2365.963,This will be more useful once we have talked about the model itself and how we have chosen to categorize services within each of these intercepts.,80,,
486,0.97,2365.963,2374.472,I will note that we are talking about approximately $8.3 million of services in the 2021 proposed budget.,80,,
487,0.97,2374.472,2379.21,"If we could move to the next slide, I will turn it over to my colleague Carlos to talk about the intercept model itself.",80,,
488,0.97,2379.21,2380.378,Thank you and good morning.,81,,
489,0.97,2380.378,2389.086,"For the record, Carlos with your city council central staff is here.",81,,
490,0.97,2389.086,2392.523,"In this slide, the existing functions are new and expanded functions in the 2021 proposed budget.",81,,
491,0.97,2392.523,2403.033,They are presented by change.,81,,
492,0.97,2405.669,2407.037,This is using and intercept model.,81,,
493,0.97,2407.037,2411.876,This model was developed to provide a conceptual the civilization to use when considering the interface between the legal system and the mental health system.,81,,
494,0.97,2411.876,2423.954,It is useful beyond its original intent as it provides a framework for where the city's program's responses and investments fall.,81,,
495,0.97,2423.954,2430.728,"The intercept model maps out the legal system by breaking it into six intercepts, corresponding to key decision points where interventions could prevent individuals from entering or penetrating deeper into the criminal legal system.",81,,
496,0.97,2430.728,2434.532,A valuable tool in mapping on how the city is investing its resources is either upstream or downstream.,81,,
497,0.97,2434.532,2446.61,"I will also note that the criminal legal system realignment work group, that Department is conducting this and they are using this model.",81,,
498,0.97,2446.61,2455.152,This is the framework we are analyzing as we go through the criminal legal system in the city to figure out where we can put together recommendations for different investments.,81,,
499,0.97,2455.152,2464.862,"With that said, this section focuses on the existing services within the first two intercepts.",81,,
500,0.97,2464.862,2466.397,This would be 0 and community services.,81,,
501,0.97,2466.397,2472.236,It could be intercepted one which is law-enforcement.,81,,
502,0.97,2472.236,2474.572,There is an intercepts that is not reflected in the model above.,81,,
503,0.97,2474.572,2481.145,It is a intermediate stage in which other than law enforcement answers calls.,81,,
504,0.97,2481.145,2481.779,This is called 0.5.,81,,
505,0.97,2481.779,2496.393,"When an individual calls 911, Dispatchers send officers or the fire Department or Life- support depending on the need.",81,,
506,0.97,2496.393,2499.396,Services other than those responses and funding where appropriate is described later in this paper.,81,,
507,0.97,2499.396,2501.765,I will turn it back over to my colleague.,81,,
508,0.97,2501.765,2513.41,We could move to the next slide.,82,,
509,0.97,2513.41,2521.919,"On page 3 of the memo, you will see some more detail here about the services that are described in intercept 0. as Carlos mentioned, this is what happens up until somebody called 911.",82,,
510,0.97,2521.919,2525.222,"I am sorry, before we move on, I am sorry.",83,,
511,0.97,2525.222,2530.928,Councilmember Lisa Herbold?,83,,
512,0.97,2530.928,2533.53,"On this previous slide, I really appreciate how this is laid out.",84,,
513,0.97,2533.53,2534.732,This is extremely helpful.,84,,
514,0.97,2534.732,2549.747,I am wondering how a program like lead to falls into this kind of visual depiction of an intercept model.,84,,
515,0.97,2549.747,2571.535,I believe the point at which lead is interacting with a potential Client/Potential offender would be before a model like choose 180.,84,,
516,0.97,2571.535,2586.951,I am curious as to why we do not have it represented here given where the lead program interacts with potential offenders.,84,,
517,0.97,2586.951,2588.752,I can answer that question.,85,,
518,0.97,2588.752,2594.458,Thank you Councilmember Lisa Herbold.,85,,
519,0.97,2594.458,2607.504,"The lead program would be generally looked at as an intercept 1. you know, it is that type of program.",85,,
520,0.97,2607.504,2608.205,It is law-enforcement.,85,,
521,0.97,2608.205,2610.307,"And generally, traditionally it would provide an alternative to an arrest.",85,,
522,0.97,2610.307,2625.923,"However, as lead moves beyond involvement with police officers, we could say that it is moving further toward intercept 0 which is community services.",85,,
523,0.97,2625.923,2637.735,There could be a point of intercept with law enforcement.,85,,
524,0.97,2638.602,2640.237,They will actively take referrals from law-enforcement.,85,,
525,0.97,2640.237,2642.206,They do not have any intention of ending that practice.,85,,
526,0.97,2642.206,2644.441,They do not want that to be a requirement of the survey.,85,,
527,0.97,2644.441,2649.98,So it would be kind of in between one and two on this model.,85,,
528,0.97,2649.98,2650.781,Thank you.,85,,
529,0.97,2650.781,2662.526,Thank you Councilmember Lisa Herbold.,86,,
530,0.97,2662.526,2664.561,I thought I saw a reference to lead somewhere.,86,,
531,0.97,2664.561,2665.562,Perhaps it is coming up later.,86,,
532,0.97,2665.562,2666.363,I appreciate it.,86,,
533,0.97,2666.363,2672.67,This is a good reminder for where it fits and how it is continuing to evolve.,86,,
534,0.97,2672.67,2674.338,It is continuing to meet our community's needs.,86,,
535,0.97,2674.338,2674.938,Options slide 3 please.,86,,
536,0.97,2674.938,2684.481,"At intercepts 0, I am on page 3 of the memo.",87,,
537,0.97,2684.481,2686.784,This has a little bit more detail about each of these services.,87,,
538,0.97,2686.784,2694.591,What we have tried to do is lay out the landscape of what we are looking at in terms of what happens before we get to the point and somebody has an incident and needs to call 911.,87,,
539,0.97,2694.591,2695.859,We are looking at everything from prevention.,87,,
540,0.97,2695.859,2698.062,These are things like prime prevention Coordinators within the precincts.,87,,
541,0.97,2698.062,2705.803,They help to help people with how to go about preventing crime when it comes to individuals or businesses.,87,,
542,0.97,2705.803,2707.571,It deals with things like community service officers.,87,,
543,0.97,2707.571,2713.31,They are helping to improve relationships between police and communities.,87,,
544,0.97,2713.31,2720.017,"It deals with critical incident responders, community crime prevention, Place-Based strategies.",87,,
545,0.97,2720.017,2723.053,"And then, these last two deal with a nurse call line and On- site nurses.",87,,
546,0.97,2723.053,2726.724,These were added to the budget in previous years under this.,87,,
547,0.97,2726.724,2739.837,"This goes from homeless service agencies . Instead of calling 911, you can call a nurse to get medical advice or on-site nurses that are part of the emergency shelters.",87,,
548,0.97,2739.837,2755.352,Everything that leads up to the point which somebody could hopefully not have to call 911 but they can call or access other resources.,87,,
549,0.97,2755.352,2761.658,I had a question about that one on the nurse call line.,88,,
550,0.97,2761.658,2763.46,So this is an internal number for service providers.,88,,
551,0.97,2763.46,2765.796,It is not a number for the general public.,88,,
552,0.97,2765.796,2770.167,This is Amy.,89,,
553,0.97,2770.167,2772.369,"I apologize, yes, that is true.",89,,
554,0.97,2772.369,2778.575,Okay.,90,,
555,0.97,2778.575,2779.042,Great.,90,,
556,0.97,2779.042,2781.378,I think this goes to another format that we will see in a bit.,90,,
557,0.97,2781.378,2788.485,"I see that . having 911, they can have a nurse line internal.",90,,
558,0.97,2788.485,2791.789,They can deal with issues On- site.,90,,
559,0.97,2791.789,2799.396,This is something similar but just for service providers.,90,,
560,0.97,2799.396,2800.764,Yes it is for service providers.,90,,
561,0.97,2800.764,2808.172,Thank you Amy.,91,,
562,0.97,2808.172,2821.118,"If there are no further questions, we can move to the next slide.",91,,
563,0.97,2821.118,2822.619,We have inserted this into the traditional model.,91,,
564,0.97,2822.619,2828.559,"When somebody calls 911, you either get a law enforcement response or you can get a Nonlaw enforcement response.",91,,
565,0.97,2828.559,2829.86,This is still a government response.,91,,
566,0.97,2829.86,2831.528,Somebody is responding for the call for service.,91,,
567,0.97,2831.528,2833.931,This is things like health one are relevant.,91,,
568,0.97,2833.931,2842.906,"So instead of an officer showing up, you have two firefighters and a mental health professional showing up.",91,,
569,0.97,2842.906,2846.743,This services the mobile crisis team.,91,,
570,0.97,2846.743,2857.821,This is a county service in which mental health and substance use disorder professionals go to the scene to see what a client needs.,91,,
571,0.97,2857.821,2865.662,It is things like one call.,91,,
572,0.97,2865.662,2867.03,This is done by crisis connections.,91,,
573,0.97,2867.03,2868.699,"Excuse me, it is a single diversion portal.",91,,
574,0.97,2868.699,2881.345,It allows first responders to show up and help individuals in a crisis.,91,,
575,0.97,2881.345,2885.983,"This category, you are looking at those things in which somebody has called 911 but it is not law-enforcement that is showing up.",91,,
576,0.97,2885.983,2887.618,Then if we move to the next slide.,91,,
577,0.97,2887.618,2904.468,"Thank you, on the crisis connection one call, that is something that people can access when they only know to call 911, this is a change that happens after they make that 911 call.",92,,
578,0.97,2904.468,2905.669,This is what the dispatch does.,92,,
579,0.97,2905.669,2907.504,Or is it a different phone number altogether?,92,,
580,0.97,2907.504,2908.872,I thought 411 was different.,92,,
581,0.97,2908.872,2925.188,You have to be one of the's people who knows that 411 is a thing.,93,,
582,0.97,2925.188,2927.524,My understanding is that it is staffed by the same organization.,94,,
583,0.97,2927.524,2932.296,One call is specifically for first responders to avoid unnecessary institutional response.,94,,
584,0.97,2932.296,2934.131,They direct any individuals in crisis to crisis connections.,94,,
585,0.97,2934.131,2937.334,Then crisis connections can hand them off to a wide variety of providers.,94,,
586,0.97,2937.334,2938.402,That is really helpful.,95,,
587,0.97,2938.402,2961.391,"Have we asked the question of what number, what percentage of 911 calls are able to be diverted from these three intercept .5, Nonlaw enforcement options here?",95,,
588,0.97,2961.792,2963.16,I cannot speak to the other two.,96,,
589,0.97,2963.16,2965.963,I can tell you that the crisis connections was technically a pilot program.,96,,
590,0.97,2965.963,2971.468,This is actually an extension of the pilot program in 2021.,96,,
591,0.97,2971.468,2980.177,"Because of how odd 2020 has been in general, they really wanted an additional year of data under hopefully what will be more normal circumstances.",96,,
592,0.97,2980.177,2992.589,This is to gather the data and learn what percentage of calls might be diverted through this type of program.,96,,
593,0.97,2992.589,2994.191,It deals with how to scale it up.,96,,
594,0.97,2994.191,3001.398,I am not sure how to answer that for the mobile crisis team or health one.,96,,
595,0.97,3001.398,3002.966,There is data for crisis connections call.,97,,
596,0.97,3002.966,3006.403,You are suggesting it may not be useful because it was a strange year.,97,,
597,0.97,3006.403,3006.803,Correct it.,98,,
598,0.97,3006.803,3007.804,"Okay, thank you.",99,,
599,0.97,3007.804,3018.014,"I would be interested in the data as well for the other two work also, I would like to see how it has reduced the number of calls that our firefighters have had to respond to.",100,,
600,0.97,3018.014,3030.794,"I believe that even though the health one project is still Tech neck Lee in its pilot phase or incident phase, we still have data showing the reduced numbers of calls.",100,,
601,0.97,3030.794,3037.701,Letters have had to be sent out or other firefighter personnel were involved.,100,,
602,0.97,3037.701,3038.735,Do you have that information?,100,,
603,0.97,3038.735,3039.936,"Well, thank you.",101,,
604,0.97,3039.936,3048.645,I am counsel central staff.,101,,
605,0.97,3048.645,3050.514,We had a call with the fire Department.,101,,
606,0.97,3050.514,3063.727,"I think one thing to know do with how the one, as you bring up Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda, the calls that it responds to have already been screened by call responders.",101,,
607,0.97,3063.727,3064.995,They fall into the medical category.,101,,
608,0.97,3064.995,3079.543,"And so, you know, just for the viewing public, when somebody called 911, the call is screened to figure out if it is a medical call or if it is a public safety call.",101,,
609,0.97,3079.543,3088.085,"If it is a medical call, then they dispatch it through to the fire 911 answers.",101,,
610,0.97,3088.085,3089.286,And they take it from there.,101,,
611,0.97,3089.286,3097.727,"And so, it is not until the call goes to the fire Department for medical purposes that health one might be dispatched.",101,,
612,0.97,3097.727,3109.206,"So, I think as you point out, really what you are doing with health one is you are relieving dispatches that would otherwise go to engine companies and Paramedics.",101,,
613,0.97,3109.206,3121.184,I think that the policy question from the Council is are there situations where health one could be dispatched to calls that have traditionally been handled by the police?,101,,
614,0.97,3121.184,3131.928,"For instance, right now, all mental health calls are sent to the police officers.",101,,
615,0.97,3131.928,3133.597,And they are not sent to health one.,101,,
616,0.97,3133.597,3146.343,There are certain kinds of wellness checks that will only go to the police.,101,,
617,0.97,3146.343,3147.978,This is once they have been screened.,101,,
618,0.97,3147.978,3150.847,"Once they have been screened as solely medical, a wellness check can go to fire.",101,,
619,0.97,3150.847,3167.731,"I think that part of the question here is not just what are they doing now and what kind of data is there but more, how could things change so that health one could go out on calls that right now are being responded to only by the police.",101,,
620,0.97,3167.731,3177.107,"Is there a way, for instance, that Dispatchers could screen a call so that maybe it is not medical?",101,,
621,0.97,3177.107,3178.875,Maybe they do not need to send in fire.,101,,
622,0.97,3178.875,3182.546,Maybe there is no public safety issues that would need a copy and they could send health one.,101,,
623,0.97,3182.546,3185.815,"I think that is why we have, the team has this before you today.",101,,
624,0.97,3185.815,3195.358,We can raise these issues and we can talk about how things might change.,101,,
625,0.97,3195.358,3196.56,I very much appreciate it.,102,,
626,0.97,3196.56,3197.594,I see a few hands.,102,,
627,0.97,3197.594,3203.199,"Just before I do that, I clicked PSA asking the health in one team.",102,,
628,0.97,3203.199,3215.445,"When you call 911, if it is a medical issue, it gets Triaged.",102,,
629,0.97,3221.184,3224.187,Hopefully it will get to them Úif they have the capacity as Greg just said.,102,,
630,0.97,3224.187,3228.625,"If you are in the community and you see somebody who is having a public health related issue, you can call 911.",102,,
631,0.97,3228.625,3230.627,You can say this is a medical related issue.,102,,
632,0.97,3230.627,3233.096,That helps them triage in case you have concerns about calling 911.,102,,
633,0.97,3233.096,3237.867,"Note for medical related issues, that is the first thing you can say that helps triage it to the public health first Responder teams.",102,,
634,0.97,3237.867,3239.803,"Is that appropriate, is that an appropriate summary Greg?",102,,
635,0.97,3239.803,3241.638,That is exactly right.,103,,
636,0.97,3241.638,3253.617,"If you specify that the emergency that you have got is medical, then it can go to health in one.",103,,
637,0.97,3253.617,3254.851,"Otherwise, the default is probably SPD.",103,,
638,0.97,3254.851,3258.288,Please note that in case you are seeing anybody interest or our interest yourself.,104,,
639,0.97,3258.288,3261.024,"As we have all been trained, call 911 if there is an emergency.",104,,
640,0.97,3261.024,3262.359,You can still call 91.,104,,
641,0.97,3262.359,3271.935,Indicate the type of emergency that will help to triage.,104,,
642,0.97,3271.935,3274.337,I did not know that was the process on the back and.,104,,
643,0.97,3274.337,3281.177,"Until we make other changes, we want to make sure folks know that information.",104,,
644,0.97,3281.177,3283.079,"Councilmember Tammy J. Morales, go ahead.",104,,
645,0.97,3283.079,3283.48,Thank you.,105,,
646,0.97,3283.48,3285.348,I think I have a couple of related questions.,105,,
647,0.97,3285.348,3291.588,"The first is that if we go to the first slide that shows the chart that you created, thank you, this is helpful.",105,,
648,0.97,3291.588,3297.293,Can we see what the different intercepts are and what the categories are in there.,105,,
649,0.97,3297.293,3305.201,Do we have an additional layer on this regarding how much we are investing in each of these different intercepts?,105,,
650,0.97,3305.201,3309.005,I think that is the question that we also need to be answering here.,105,,
651,0.97,3309.005,3326.256,"You know, as the matt Mauro, further on the memo, particularly as the RS Ji question is addressed, I would like to thank central staff for that section of the memo in particular.",105,,
652,0.97,3326.256,3330.427,I think it is a very important element of the memo.,105,,
653,0.97,3330.427,3351.514,"As we are talking about all of these processes and all of these, you know, organizations and programs and pilots that we are doing, I think that we need to be asking the bigger question of what outcomes are we looking for with all of this.",105,,
654,0.97,3351.514,3352.349,What are we Duplicating?,105,,
655,0.97,3352.349,3356.619,What additional burden are we placing on communities by Re- creating something that is already in place or is already existing well?,105,,
656,0.97,3356.619,3365.962,"And so, you know, for me, the slide about is this intercept .5.",105,,
657,0.97,3365.962,3390.286,"If we invest further upstream, if we invest in the outreach workers for homelessness, the kind of programming that we are trying to get, the funding that we are trying to get out the door for this year, what impact will that have on health in one?",105,,
658,0.97,3390.286,3391.755,How will it affect Desc?,105,,
659,0.97,3391.755,3395.558,Will they be able to reduce the burden on the fire Department of responding to calls about homelessness?,105,,
660,0.97,3395.558,3405.568,This is so they can get back to fighting fires.,105,,
661,0.97,3405.568,3409.606,"If we invest further upstream in the homelessness services, that is the basic point that I'm trying to make care.",105,,
662,0.97,3409.606,3415.912,And the question is do we have an understanding of what the investments are at each of these intercept levels.,105,,
663,0.97,3415.912,3425.021,"I think I would say that the idea, the framing here is that the more we are investing upstream, the more that we are diverting away from even touches with the criminal legal system.",106,,
664,0.97,3425.021,3427.323,"And so, that is in part why we use this intercept model.",106,,
665,0.97,3427.323,3432.362,It intercepts in ways where people can exit from the criminal legal system.,106,,
666,0.97,3432.362,3436.8,"To your point, I want to get to the first issue Id.",106,,
667,0.97,3436.8,3454.117,The first issue is really around what to invest in in order to downstream decrease the involvement of people in the system.,106,,
668,0.97,3454.117,3466.062,"The fewer people who are involved in the system, the fewer resources will need governmentally to address the system as part of the governmental institution.",106,,
669,0.97,3466.062,3468.331,This goes back to why we framed the paper this way.,106,,
670,0.97,3468.331,3480.076,"It is because for these remaining intercepts for things like the courts for the jails, I think that it is a little bit easier to figure out what the spending is there.",106,,
671,0.97,3480.076,3483.48,"You have, for the courts for example, you have the Seattle municipal Court's budget.",106,,
672,0.97,3483.48,3497.627,That takes care of an entire intercept when we are looking at prosecutions.,106,,
673,0.97,3497.627,3500.463,We are looking at for example the criminal division of the city attorney's office.,106,,
674,0.97,3500.463,3505.501,"When we are looking at these earlier intercepts and we are looking more in terms of community services, it is a little bit more amorphous.",106,,
675,0.97,3505.501,3510.773,That is why we decided to look at these range of services rather than zooming in on the later intercepts.,106,,
676,0.97,3510.773,3528.224,"This is using the assumption that if we do invest more upstream, we are freeing up both the providers in the system that do not necessarily need to be using their resources to respond to 911 calls.",106,,
677,0.97,3528.224,3531.127,"As you said, they can go fight fires instead of responding to these calls.",106,,
678,0.97,3531.127,3533.329,A crisis line could not take care of that medical issue.,106,,
679,0.97,3533.329,3536.132,That leads to less in the system itself.,106,,
680,0.97,3536.132,3545.508,"So by the end of this intercept, you are in something like the transformed probation.",106,,
681,0.97,3545.508,3553.449,We very briefly talked about this earlier.,106,,
682,0.97,3553.449,3557.253,We talked about cutting the funds for probation and using a model that is very much human centered.,106,,
683,0.97,3557.253,3563.96,This is as opposed to people in the system in a Time-Based versus Goal-Based way.,106,,
684,0.97,3563.96,3565.495,Does that help answer your question?,106,,
685,0.97,3565.495,3575.772,Thank you.,107,,
686,0.97,3575.772,3580.243,"If there were not any other questions, we can move into the slide on intercept one.",108,,
687,0.97,3580.243,3587.55,This is the law enforcement response to 911 calls.,108,,
688,0.97,3587.55,3605.034,"So, here we are looking at a police officer responding to these calls.",108,,
689,0.97,3605.468,3607.67,This is not the regular response of police officers without additional training.,108,,
690,0.97,3607.67,3609.939,"Specifically, you have the crisis response unit in SPD.",108,,
691,0.97,3609.939,3620.783,Officers who are showing up along with a professional for somebody in crisis is irrelevant.,108,,
692,0.97,3620.783,3624.921,We are talking about crisis intervention trained officers.,108,,
693,0.97,3624.921,3627.056,All members are required to go through crisis intervention training.,108,,
694,0.97,3627.056,3632.228,You also have the officers that deal with additional crisis intervention.,108,,
695,0.97,3632.228,3644.841,This piece is primarily about mitigating the impact of having law enforcement respond to a call.,108,,
696,0.97,3644.841,3646.042,This is something like emergency services control.,108,,
697,0.97,3646.042,3655.451,You have an outreach team that is present to engage people.,108,,
698,0.97,3655.451,3674.303,"The idea of this intercept is yes, you have the traditional response of the police Department but there is also responses that can mitigate the effects of what happens and the potential harm in terms of what happens when law enforcement shows up to somebody in crisis.",108,,
699,0.97,3676.406,3680.376,"If it would be possible, I could add a bit on this if the chair does not mind.",109,,
700,0.97,3680.376,3686.482,"So, the thing that I would add on the crisis response, just your description was perfect.",109,,
701,0.97,3686.482,3690.787,"But I would like to note that currently, right now, there are five crisis response units in the city.",109,,
702,0.97,3690.787,3697.36,That is five officers that are paired with five mental health providers.,109,,
703,0.97,3697.36,3729.125,"And the information that we received from the Department says that the police Department, in most cases, the vast majority of the responders who are responding to 911 calls that are labeled as disturbances, those are individuals who are creating a situation where the public has concerns about their actions or behaviors.",109,,
704,0.97,3729.125,3730.526,"Really, these are people who are in crisis.",109,,
705,0.97,3730.526,3734.464,"And so, when the Cru response to those calls, the role of the officer is to insure scene safety.",109,,
706,0.97,3734.464,3739.902,It is the mental health provider that engages with the person.,109,,
707,0.97,3739.902,3740.536,This is initially.,109,,
708,0.97,3740.536,3741.337,And that is important.,109,,
709,0.97,3741.337,3745.808,It is a very different way of responding to the disturbance calls that we have been talking about.,109,,
710,0.97,3745.808,3757.72,"As PD has said that they are, they do not currently have the resources to expand their call responses in those areas.",109,,
711,0.97,3757.72,3784.58,"And so, one potential option the Council could consider for mitigating harm in the short term is to expand the number of crisis response units so that there is a greater capacity for the Department to send out teams of officers or a team of an Officerand a mental health provider to more calls.",109,,
712,0.97,3784.58,3792.088,They can put the mental health provider in the front so to speak.,109,,
713,0.97,3792.088,3793.589,There are certainly opportunities to do that.,109,,
714,0.97,3793.589,3795.558,We have some data about just mental health calls alone.,109,,
715,0.97,3795.558,3803.599,This would suggest that you could have a significant increase in Cru trained units.,109,,
716,0.97,3803.599,3806.502,There would be demand for it.,109,,
717,0.97,3806.502,3810.406,We can get you that data.,109,,
718,0.97,3810.406,3819.715,Some of it was in my paper yesterday.,109,,
719,0.97,3819.715,3822.185,"Thank you, Councilmember Lisa Herbold and then Councilmember Andrew J. Lewis.",110,,
720,0.97,3822.185,3836.833,I would be interested to know what your thoughts are about how to Incentivize a crisis response unit that relies less on SPD officers for backup.,111,,
721,0.97,3836.833,3858.888,"I of course acknowledge that there are times when it is necessary and appropriate for armed police to be available and or present . During the summer rebalancing discussions, many of us on the Council heard from the mental health workers that work for the crisis response unit.",111,,
722,0.97,3858.888,3874.17,They themselves acknowledge that they appreciate the support of the police Department.,111,,
723,0.97,3874.17,3884.947,It might be worthwhile looking at making shifts to the model.,111,,
724,0.97,3884.947,3887.483,It does not always assume that an armed officer needs to be there.,111,,
725,0.97,3887.483,3892.855,"And so I think, as I understand it at least, the model currently is, that is the team, that is who goes.",111,,
726,0.97,3892.855,3903.599,There is no question on the front end of whether or not the team with the officer is always necessary.,111,,
727,0.97,3903.599,3905.868,"And so, you know, we have talked about the cahoots model.",111,,
728,0.97,3905.868,3922.918,"I think this is a model that does rely at least from the analysis that I have heard, it does rely more on the backup provided by officers.",111,,
729,0.97,3922.918,3926.789,"Another program that we have heard a lot about recently, it is the Star program out of Denver.",111,,
730,0.97,3926.789,3931.827,It does not rely on officers to go to calls.,111,,
731,0.97,3931.827,3952.381,"So if we were interested in a model that had less reliance on officers to accompany our crisis response unit on all calls, how could we begin to move in that direction?",111,,
732,0.97,3952.381,3953.149,"Yes, thank you.",112,,
733,0.97,3953.149,3956.018,"That is something that Carlos, my colleague is doing a bit of research on.",112,,
734,0.97,3956.018,3957.053,He has looked at cahoots.,112,,
735,0.97,3957.053,3960.523,That is the model that he is a little bit more prepared to speak to you on.,112,,
736,0.97,3960.523,3966.662,"I was merely pointing out that on the calls, the 911 center gets the calls.",112,,
737,0.97,3966.662,3975.471,"There is a potential, a need for an officer, it could be something such as a disturbance.",112,,
738,0.97,3975.471,3983.579,There are many more calls and their are an opportunity for a crisis response unit two go to the calls.,112,,
739,0.97,3983.579,4000.296,"And so, on those where you might need a police officer, there are not enough crisis Responseunits to go to.",112,,
740,0.97,4000.296,4007.003,"I think your point is, changing your processes so that as dispatch is taking the calls, they could determine if it was a disturbance that really required an officer.",112,,
741,0.97,4007.003,4011.774,"If not, then that is where the cahoots type model would come into play.",112,,
742,0.97,4011.774,4017.88,"Carlos, Carlos can speak or about that.",112,,
743,0.97,4017.88,4027.523,"I would like to underscore, think that what we are hearing from community is not the cahoots type model.",113,,
744,0.97,4027.523,4028.991,It is more like the Star model.,113,,
745,0.97,4028.991,4032.027,The Star model has less reliance on law enforcement accompany it.,113,,
746,0.97,4032.027,4043.039,Go ahead Councilmember Lewis.,114,,
747,0.97,4043.039,4045.441,It could dovetail into this and Carlos could address both of them.,114,,
748,0.97,4045.441,4047.877,My understanding is cahoots does not have law enforcement accompanying them.,115,,
749,0.97,4047.877,4057.953,The Star program is essentially a carbon copy of the cahoots model in Denver.,115,,
750,0.97,4057.953,4065.161,"From my conversation with the cahoots people and the Star people and the town hall that I had in July, the start people were pretty emphatic that there model is taken directly from cahoots.",115,,
751,0.97,4065.161,4068.964,My understanding is that there is community concern.,115,,
752,0.97,4068.964,4077.973,This is from talking to folks at King County equity now about cahoots.,115,,
753,0.97,4077.973,4079.442,Eugene has a dispatch that is sworn.,115,,
754,0.97,4079.442,4080.176,That is an issue.,115,,
755,0.97,4080.176,4086.081,"So the Eugene police Department, 911 Dispatchers are uniformed officers.",115,,
756,0.97,4086.081,4091.487,That is an issue that we do not have here.,115,,
757,0.97,4091.487,4092.922,This is since our Dispatchers are civilian.,115,,
758,0.97,4092.922,4095.524,We are going to move them away from sworn oversight and supervision.,115,,
759,0.97,4095.524,4101.664,They will be a fully civilian model.,115,,
760,0.97,4101.664,4124.42,"The Statistics that I have seen from cahoots and maybe Carlos could jump into this is that it's workers like Star workers in Denver, they have the ability to call the police for backup if they feel that it is warranted . But with the data that they have provided in 2019, they only elected to do that 150 times out of 24,000 calls.",115,,
761,0.97,4124.42,4125.621,They very very rarely do it.,115,,
762,0.97,4125.621,4127.056,"That is super helpful, thank you.",116,,
763,0.97,4127.056,4133.529,It is an issue that Eugene has a model where sworn officers are the Gatekeepers to what gets sent where.,117,,
764,0.97,4133.529,4144.373,That is something that we do not have quite as big of an issue here since we have a civilian dispatcher course.,117,,
765,0.97,4144.373,4147.943,They will be removed from sworn command and control.,117,,
766,0.97,4147.943,4154.85,I will let Carlos jump in on that as well.,117,,
767,0.97,4154.85,4156.318,Thank you Councilmember Andrew J. Lewis.,118,,
768,0.97,4156.318,4159.755,I do not know that I could have provided a better answer than what you gave.,118,,
769,0.97,4159.755,4167.663,"Andrew J. Lewis, did you have more?",119,,
770,0.97,4167.663,4169.565,"Okay, I also have some questions about CIT.",120,,
771,0.97,4169.565,4172.134,I can move onto that now if that would be good.,120,,
772,0.97,4172.134,4173.168,That would be great.,121,,
773,0.97,4173.168,4183.546,"Before you do, I have some items and I will use those as a follow-up to what you are about to say.",121,,
774,0.97,4183.546,4185.18,I would like to put a plug in.,121,,
775,0.97,4185.18,4194.29,I think this entire counsel has been tremendously supported.,121,,
776,0.97,4194.29,4197.76,"Councilmember Andrew J. Lewis and others who have been in conversations, please feel free to Chime in.",121,,
777,0.97,4197.76,4202.798,"My understanding from talking to the folks at health one, they really felt like this was our Seattle home grown cahoots style model.",121,,
778,0.97,4202.798,4208.504,It was a model that was in the similar vein of cahoots.,121,,
779,0.97,4208.504,4216.612,It was really more representative of what the size of the city of Seattle needed.,121,,
780,0.97,4216.612,4228.224,"And so while there might be other models that work for various size cities that are relatively smaller, we should, we can consider the health one model that is here.",121,,
781,0.97,4228.224,4240.369,We can consider that very similar if not Seattle's own version of cahoots.,121,,
782,0.97,4243.906,4248.344,I think that it would be helpful to hear from central staff and the other Council members take on that as well.,121,,
783,0.97,4248.344,4250.613,I wanted to bring that back and to highlight that conversation.,121,,
784,0.97,4250.613,4257.653,"If that is true and other folks feel that way, I think it is really a matter of saying great, what are the changes that we can make to get more support for health one.",121,,
785,0.97,4257.653,4262.958,We need to make sure there is less interaction with those sworn officers making sure that people feel safe and have the safety they need.,121,,
786,0.97,4262.958,4266.362,I wanted to offer that and see if that was the Seattle Homegrown Scalable cahoots style model.,121,,
787,0.97,4266.362,4275.337,What are your thoughts?,121,,
788,0.97,4275.337,4283.879,I will take a stab at it and turn it over to Carlos who has done a little bit more on cahoots.,122,,
789,0.97,4283.879,4293.389,I think the challenge with that approach is that I think that cahoots also responds to calls with people who are in mental health crisis.,122,,
790,0.97,4293.389,4313.309,"The challenge with that particular approach is that right now, those folks who are in mental health crisis only receives SPD response.",122,,
791,0.97,4313.309,4333.429,That is where you would again need to change your policies and procedures at the dispatch center and 911 call center so that there was some sort of screening that would allow for the dispatcher to send health one to a mental health call where they knew that there was not going to be any kind of a need for a public safety officer to provide protection for the firefighters and the mental health providers.,122,,
792,0.97,4333.429,4343.806,So I think you absolutely could see that health one could be used like cahoots.,122,,
793,0.97,4343.806,4356.919,It is just a matter of revising some of the way that Seattle handles it's did Batching.,122,,
794,0.97,4361.123,4362.391,"Carlos, do you have anything to add?",122,,
795,0.97,4362.391,4363.926,"Yes, I have something, thank you Greg.",123,,
796,0.97,4363.926,4383.779,"In addition to what you said which is spot on, the other difference I have seen when researching health one of the cahoots model is that the cahoots model, because it is a nonprofit and it is not using fire Department personnel, they have a lot of folks that were former clients of the cahoots model that are now shifting and working in it.",123,,
797,0.97,4383.779,4393.455,So one of the things that cahoots would say is that it is also a form of community support in making sure that the community is more involved in the treatment and really building on the community acknowledgment from the folks who have gone through the system.,123,,
798,0.97,4393.455,4397.459,"With health one, because it is institutionalized, that is one of the components that would be different.",123,,
799,0.97,4397.459,4411.206,"And Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda, if I can jump in and Role-Play a central staff and build on what Greg and Carlos have said on this as well, I would like to.",124,,
800,0.97,4411.206,4424.72,I asked this exact question so that I could report back on my antic total information.,124,,
801,0.97,4429.391,4431.126,How do you compare yourselves to cahoots or whatever?,124,,
802,0.97,4431.126,4436.832,"In one of the responses they gave is that it is their understanding, and this is something I want to flag for central staff to look into.",124,,
803,0.97,4436.832,4441.503,They thought one the biggest differences from their perspective is that health one actually has more back and work than the cahoots model does.,124,,
804,0.97,4441.503,4447.81,"Health one has a more integrated, like half of their job is going out in the field to do the first response.",124,,
805,0.97,4447.81,4449.845,The other half is that they actually do ongoing casework.,124,,
806,0.97,4449.845,4458.453,They were not aware of whether cahoots or the Star pilot in Denver has such a robust back nd casework system.,124,,
807,0.97,4458.453,4472.568,"So in some ways, health one could be described as cahoots plus.",124,,
808,0.97,4472.568,4474.837,I would want to look into that a little bit more.,124,,
809,0.97,4474.837,4482.344,"My understanding is that at least in Eugene, cahoots is based out of a Desc.",124,,
810,0.97,4482.344,4490.853,I would imagine that there would be some kind of follow-up casework that would be part of that.,124,,
811,0.97,4490.853,4493.488,That would be something to look into if that is a real difference.,124,,
812,0.97,4493.488,4499.995,Obviously the difference is what Carlos laid out in terms of who was doing it.,124,,
813,0.97,4499.995,4501.73,There is no government integrated component to cahoots.,124,,
814,0.97,4501.73,4512.174,It is all provider taste.,124,,
815,0.97,4512.875,4513.809,So is Star in Denver.,124,,
816,0.97,4513.809,4517.479,It would be like if Desc had a first response team that was integrated into 911 dispatch.,124,,
817,0.97,4517.479,4518.48,There is disadvantages of that.,124,,
818,0.97,4518.48,4524.186,This is what I can tell from talking to people in this field.,124,,
819,0.97,4524.186,4525.187,"Very helpful, thank you.",125,,
820,0.97,4525.187,4531.026,You also still have the floor for the next issue on crisis intervention.,125,,
821,0.97,4531.026,4553.815,"Yes, I did live and the mission of the unit.",126,,
822,0.97,4553.815,4563.158,They similarly made representations to me that there is a whole bunch of different calls that they could respond to without the sworn officer present.,126,,
823,0.97,4563.158,4566.028,"This is depending on the nature of the call, the location of the call.",126,,
824,0.97,4566.028,4569.865,When I would be interested in and I am just flagging this.,126,,
825,0.97,4569.865,4572.568,I would like a Venn diagram of some of these different response models.,126,,
826,0.97,4572.568,4595.691,"I think that there is a lot of overlap between health one's response, the crisis intervention team's response, and if we move to some other Community-Based cahoots or Star model, there would be an overlap in that response.",126,,
827,0.97,4595.691,4606.201,"Things that do have a very strong criminal nexus but are also mental health related, they would certainly be a CIT response.",126,,
828,0.97,4606.201,4609.471,"If there was someone who poses a potential public safety risk, CIT would go to that.",126,,
829,0.97,4609.471,4622.284,"I feel like at the center of the Venn diagram, there is the call of like you know, somebody is in a doorway, unresponsive.",126,,
830,0.97,4622.284,4623.118,"You know, they are alone.",126,,
831,0.97,4623.118,4626.121,Possibly they are under the influence of a substance.,126,,
832,0.97,4626.121,4628.79,It seems like all of these things could respond to that right now.,126,,
833,0.97,4628.79,4638.333,This is as it is currently constituted.,126,,
834,0.97,4638.333,4641.403,"To make CIT's mission more Impactful, this is just me flagging my preferred approach.",126,,
835,0.97,4641.403,4650.145,I would almost make their response portfolio more niche and more towards things that are Exigent public safety criminal threats.,126,,
836,0.97,4650.145,4668.964,"We would rely on the other low Acuity responders to deal with things that have a very very clear nexus that is exclusively dealing with behavioral mental health, substance addiction, and even in some cases, it deals with criminal activity.",126,,
837,0.97,4668.964,4671.366,"It could involve you know, somebody who is like Trespassing.",126,,
838,0.97,4671.366,4676.471,"Clearly, what is happening is that they are having a behavioral mental health episode.",126,,
839,0.97,4676.471,4678.774,They do not really know exactly where they are.,126,,
840,0.97,4678.774,4698.66,It is like they are Trespassing but they are not maliciously or knowingly doing it . I think that would be a health one or a cahoots kind of intervention instead of like CIT.,126,,
841,0.97,4698.66,4702.564,"I think Greg, to your point about really, intentionally engaging the CIT, my understanding is that it is critical.",126,,
842,0.97,4702.564,4703.865,It has a really important place.,126,,
843,0.97,4703.865,4709.204,We need to keep it and work with CIT.,126,,
844,0.97,4709.204,4740.102,"I want to make sure that as we are doing that work, you know, we are making sure that in the Venn diagram with these other types of responses, we are maybe giving them the mission to lean into the things that you know, we have most people who agree that there should be a sworn officer present for the protection of the public and the personnel that are responding.",126,,
845,0.97,4740.102,4746.541,I think that is a smaller category that might not necessitate expansion of CIT.,126,,
846,0.97,4746.541,4751.98,It may justify maintaining its current size as we give some of the current duties to some of the other models we are discussing.,126,,
847,0.97,4751.98,4753.215,"Yes, I totally appreciate that.",127,,
848,0.97,4753.215,4792.487,"If I could offer one sought on that, as the Council considers the change in public safety services and sort of Re- envisions public safety, as the city of Seattle moves towards a system, dispatching system and a 911 call system where they are better able to discern the calls that would not require a police officer, the CIT is there in between the time when we get to that point and where we are now.",127,,
849,0.97,4792.487,4799.194,We handle those disturbance calls.,127,,
850,0.97,4799.194,4804.499,There has not been a Vetting of the call to determine that there is no public safety urgency that is there.,127,,
851,0.97,4804.499,4829.891,"So, you know, one potential option for the Council to consider is whether there is a crisis response unit temporary or short-term expansion as the city moves into a system where they can better discern calls that do not have any public safety nexus and they could be handled by health one or a community provider.",127,,
852,0.97,4829.891,4848.143,"Until that point, it is going to be the case that as disturbances or other calls that are mental health, that body of work is owned by the police Department.",127,,
853,0.97,4848.143,4851.012,They will continue to receive a 911 response from the police Department.,127,,
854,0.97,4851.012,4855.85,They could potentially have more crisis response units available until that we reach another place.,127,,
855,0.97,4855.85,4858.32,This is just a thought.,127,,
856,0.97,4858.32,4860.956,I appreciate this conversation.,128,,
857,0.97,4860.956,4867.662,"Councilmember Andrew J. Lewis, I do not what to cut you off.",128,,
858,0.97,4867.662,4891.486,"Part of that, those are really really good points, from my conversation with the folks at Star, about this, and they are relaying how they talk to Úthe cahoots program in Eugene to set up their pilots, some of that can be developed through 911 dispatch screening processes.",129,,
859,0.97,4891.486,4912.574,"And, they can really work with the dispatch on how to determine what would be an appropriate thing to send where.",129,,
860,0.97,4912.574,4914.976,I think that would be part of the equation as well.,129,,
861,0.97,4914.976,4925.32,May be it would deal with looking critically at the training and systems and practices in the Denver and Eugene dispatches.,129,,
862,0.97,4925.32,4937.932,We would look at how they make those determinations at that level and what to send.,129,,
863,0.97,4937.932,4941.403,"When they exclusively send something like Star or cahoots, I think that is a first layer of it.",129,,
864,0.97,4941.403,4951.947,"Of course, I can totally see scenarios where even if the screening criteria you know, does not capture exactly what is going on, you could have a CIT respond.",129,,
865,0.97,4951.947,4953.548,They could clear the call and move on.,129,,
866,0.97,4953.548,4961.356,"They determined that it is a lower, it is a lower public safety threats.",129,,
867,0.97,4961.356,4963.325,They could flag it for a different type of Responder.,129,,
868,0.97,4963.325,4973.668,"I think that there is really leaning have a into the practices, procedures, and training for dispatch.",129,,
869,0.97,4973.668,4985.547,I think this is part and parcel to this discussion as well.,129,,
870,0.97,4990.418,4991.753,"Excellent points, thank you all very much.",130,,
871,0.97,4991.753,4993.855,I know we have a dense memo to get through.,130,,
872,0.97,4993.855,4996.458,I want to make sure that we give it the time it needs.,130,,
873,0.97,4996.458,4997.659,We are going to continue here.,130,,
874,0.97,4997.659,4998.86,Remind me where we are at.,130,,
875,0.97,4998.86,5000.695,We are at the bottom of page 4.,130,,
876,0.97,5000.695,5002.897,I will add a few more things before you move on.,130,,
877,0.97,5002.897,5018.847,"Very briefly, if we can double check with health one, I know that from my conversation with them, they are responding to mental health calls.",130,,
878,0.97,5018.847,5020.815,I think the nexus is because it is co-occurring.,130,,
879,0.97,5020.815,5022.884,It is co-occurring with something else that might be health related.,130,,
880,0.97,5022.884,5025.487,We should double check to see how those co-occurring situations are addressed.,130,,
881,0.97,5025.487,5031.126,That might help us with changing the policies that are related to Howell 911 handles those calls and send them off to a different person.,130,,
882,0.97,5031.126,5032.494,That policy clarification would be helpful.,130,,
883,0.97,5032.494,5040.735,"And then, there is the second thing.",130,,
884,0.97,5040.735,5043.471,"If I might be so bold, central staff, correct me if I am wrong.",130,,
885,0.97,5043.471,5055.75,"When we did the rock through of the Seattle fire Department's priorities, one of the forums that I had was on training.",130,,
886,0.97,5055.75,5057.419,We did lessons learned on trauma informed training.,130,,
887,0.97,5057.419,5063.057,I believe that type of training for the Seattle fire Department could potentially fit into here as well.,130,,
888,0.97,5063.057,5065.727,It could fit into a similar vein of a crisis intervention trained officers.,130,,
889,0.97,5065.727,5089.25,"In situations where our firefighter personnel are out either dealing with somebody who has a mental health crisis or they have found somebody who is weeping in the streets and they have been called to those situations, if there is a case where somebody who is Agitated or aggressive who is by them.",130,,
890,0.97,5089.25,5092.287,"Firefighters feel that their safety is at risk, they are also likely to call 911.",130,,
891,0.97,5092.287,5093.288,More personnel to show up.,130,,
892,0.97,5093.288,5118.913,One of the things that both the firefighters and folks within the health one mentioned to me was that the way in which they had been trained to De-Escalate the situation and really get to know the individuals that they are working with and create relationships is to help them to feel like they need to call SPD less frequently.,130,,
893,0.97,5118.913,5121.149,This is because they have more skills to handle the situation.,130,,
894,0.97,5121.149,5130.391,We are often dealing with tense situations.,130,,
895,0.97,5130.391,5133.161,One firefighter is watching out for the team because they are concerned about Dynamics.,130,,
896,0.97,5133.161,5138.633,Having additional training on how to help De-Escalate situations can also reduce the incidences where SPD is called for something that is truly a Health-Related issue.,130,,
897,0.97,5138.633,5144.939,"I wanted to flag that to see if that is also something, if it were to advance, it could be in a similar vein as what we are seeing in an intervention.",130,,
898,0.97,5144.939,5153.648,We can prevent fewer incidents when sworn and armed officers are called to a scene that is truly not necessary.,130,,
899,0.97,5153.648,5156.251,We can De-Escalate the situation with additional training.,130,,
900,0.97,5156.251,5160.755,Thoughts on that?,130,,
901,0.97,5160.755,5161.155,Okay.,130,,
902,0.97,5161.155,5168.663,Did you have anything on that?,130,,
903,0.97,5168.663,5168.897,Okay.,130,,
904,0.97,5168.897,5169.097,Okay.,130,,
905,0.97,5169.097,5173.501,I would love to follow up with you to see if that makes sense and if it is part of the intervention.,130,,
906,0.97,5173.501,5180.875,We can definitely dig into that and get back to you.,131,,
907,0.97,5180.875,5188.783,"Okay, if there are no other questions, we can move to the next slide.",132,,
908,0.97,5188.783,5191.185,It talks about changes in the 2021 proposed budget more broadly.,132,,
909,0.97,5191.185,5208.77,"In the interest of time, I believe that we all have talked about moving the Spd911 center into a new Department.",132,,
910,0.97,5211.573,5215.21,"In the SPD use paper yesterday, we talked about moving the enforcement officers to Sdot office as well.",132,,
911,0.97,5215.21,5218.079,"If there are no questions, I propose we move to the third change.",132,,
912,0.97,5218.079,5224.919,This is the safe and thriving community's division.,132,,
913,0.97,5224.919,5226.588,I have one quick question on this.,133,,
914,0.97,5226.588,5227.388,"Yes, go ahead.",134,,
915,0.97,5227.388,5229.023,Can we go back to the slide?,135,,
916,0.97,5229.023,5239.234,I am sorry.,135,,
917,0.97,5243.304,5246.007,"It is not that sly, it is the one about traffic enforcement.",136,,
918,0.97,5246.007,5247.242,It is dealing with parking enforcement.,136,,
919,0.97,5247.242,5247.909,There we go.,137,,
920,0.97,5247.909,5248.943,"Excellent, we are there.",138,,
921,0.97,5248.943,5251.913,"Okay so, I guess I just have a quick question for central staff.",139,,
922,0.97,5251.913,5252.947,I think I know the answer.,139,,
923,0.97,5252.947,5271.065,I just want to see or maybe flag to central staff that I would be interested in the best way to make sure that this happens.,139,,
924,0.97,5271.065,5272.834,This is regardless of where parking enforcement ultimately lands.,139,,
925,0.97,5272.834,5274.269,This is based on our discussions this fall.,139,,
926,0.97,5274.269,5296.19,"I am making sure that wherever they go, we want an attendant policy to go with them to expand their duties consistent with what the itemized in their letter to us earlier this month or last month indicating additional things that they could take on.",139,,
927,0.97,5296.19,5300.128,I do not think it matters what Department they are into have the authority to do those things.,139,,
928,0.97,5300.128,5314.709,"I think as long as the bargaining unit wants to take on those duties and it has duly bargained with other ones, they could do those things even if they were in Sdot.",139,,
929,0.97,5314.709,5322.617,I would like to confirm that here and flag my interest in pursuing that.,139,,
930,0.97,5322.617,5323.318,Thank you Councilmember.,140,,
931,0.97,5323.318,5327.922,"Yes, I would like to respond to that from Councilmember Lewis.",141,,
932,0.97,5327.922,5337.699,"The legislation, the budget legislation that we discussed yesterday related to the P letter E letter owes moving to Stot.",141,,
933,0.97,5337.699,5349.51,We have discussed this with central staff.,141,,
934,0.97,5350.111,5352.914,We have an interest in amending the budget legislation to address just those issues.,141,,
935,0.97,5352.914,5369.464,"This is giving P letter E letter owes the authority to do work like automated traffic enforcement, red light and speed light traffic enforcement duties.",141,,
936,0.97,5369.464,5370.565,There is the list of things.,141,,
937,0.97,5370.565,5372.9,We are looking to amend the legislation to include those things.,141,,
938,0.97,5372.9,5380.341,We even want an understanding that the shift of some of those responsibilities might require some bargaining.,141,,
939,0.97,5380.341,5395.59,"If I might also respond to that, that I think is the case in certain instances.",142,,
940,0.97,5395.59,5397.091,This is what the Council has discussed.,142,,
941,0.97,5397.091,5415.676,"For instance, when a traffic light is out or if there is event duties where a traffic light is being attended to by a police officer rather than a V letter Eo, that may be a case where that can be bargained or individuals might have the ability to do that under state law.",142,,
942,0.97,5415.676,5428.089,This is as you are aware . State law does require I believe a police officer to issue the citations on automated enforcement.,142,,
943,0.97,5428.089,5430.024,That is absolutely something that could be pursued.,142,,
944,0.97,5430.024,5439.233,I believe a change to state law would be required.,142,,
945,0.97,5439.233,5441.035,We checked with the law Department on that.,143,,
946,0.97,5441.035,5460.955,"They seemed to think that even though state law does specifically call out a law enforcement officer doing the back and writing of the tickets, they seemed to suggest, and I will send you the Email from the law Department that there is, I forget what it is called.",143,,
947,0.97,5460.955,5462.99,I think it is the law enforcement certification process.,143,,
948,0.97,5462.99,5467.061,We could do it for that particular function.,143,,
949,0.97,5467.061,5476.571,This is even though there is language in the Rcw.,143,,
950,0.97,5476.571,5489.484,I appreciate you flagging that Councilmember Lisa Herbold.,144,,
951,0.97,5489.484,5493.287,"That is definitely a low hanging fruit if we can go ahead and advance that effort, we appreciate it.",144,,
952,0.97,5493.287,5494.755,It is called special commissions.,145,,
953,0.97,5494.755,5496.557,Do you want to say that again?,146,,
954,0.97,5496.557,5502.997,"It is the, it is an ability to grant what is called a special police officer Commission.",147,,
955,0.97,5502.997,5508.903,"But yes, I will definitely pass this on.",147,,
956,0.97,5508.903,5509.904,Thank you very much.,148,,
957,0.97,5509.904,5512.073,"Okay, I think we are ready to move forward.",148,,
958,0.97,5512.073,5526.721,"Council members, this is Amy from Council central staff.",149,,
959,0.97,5532.36,5538.032,The third change in the proposed budget to discuss today is the consolidation of safety programs into a new division of Hds called safe and thriving communities.,149,,
960,0.97,5538.032,5542.103,Currently they administer community safety interventions both within the safety program which is housed at the youth and family empowerment division.,149,,
961,0.97,5542.103,5549.944,It is for Gender-Based violence response.,149,,
962,0.97,5549.944,5552.413,This is housed in the Mayor's office on domestic violence and sexual assault.,149,,
963,0.97,5552.413,5559.654,The 2021 budget would combine these functions into a new division called safe and thriving communities.,149,,
964,0.97,5559.654,5565.76,This division would also include the victim advocacy program which was transferred from SPD during the 2020 budget revision this summer.,149,,
965,0.97,5565.76,5568.629,"In 2020, these three functions were funded with 19 4 million.",149,,
966,0.97,5568.629,5577.371,"The proposed budget, the new is 21.4 million.",149,,
967,0.97,5577.371,5587.748,"While this is a net increase, there are reductions included such as the ramp down.",149,,
968,0.97,5587.748,5597.591,This provided one time funding to community partners who were previously funded through the Seattle youth violence prevention.,149,,
969,0.97,5597.591,5600.261,They were no longer aligned with the goals after the community Codesigned process.,149,,
970,0.97,5600.261,5601.762,Some of you might recall this.,149,,
971,0.97,5601.762,5611.706,This new division includes 2 million in funding for investments.,149,,
972,0.97,5611.706,5613.874,This will be informed by the Participatory budgeting process.,149,,
973,0.97,5613.874,5616.978,It will be informed by the joint community interdepartmental team.,149,,
974,0.97,5616.978,5621.415,This will be discussed shortly as part of item number five.,149,,
975,0.97,5621.415,5632.226,"That is all that I wanted to highlight as part of this change to the budget . unless there are any questions, I will turn it over to Carlos to talk about number four.",149,,
976,0.97,5632.226,5632.627,Yes.,150,,
977,0.97,5632.627,5632.827,Okay.,150,,
978,0.97,5632.827,5636.03,Thank you very much Amy.,150,,
979,0.97,5636.03,5638.699,"All right, thank you counsel.",151,,
980,0.97,5638.699,5653.748,The fourth item is the expansion of health one.,151,,
981,0.97,5653.748,5656.951,"The 2021 budget would add $571,000 to the fire Department to expand the health one program.",151,,
982,0.97,5656.951,5659.453,Those would support a second team of two firefighters and one case manager.,151,,
983,0.97,5659.453,5667.161,They would respond to medical system calls that do not require emergency Department transportation.,151,,
984,0.97,5667.161,5669.13,To divert patients to appropriate destinations would be included.,151,,
985,0.97,5669.13,5673.167,A second team would enable the program to cover core operating hours during week days when partner services are open.,151,,
986,0.97,5673.167,5680.341,It would expand geographic coverage to a number of neighborhoods.,151,,
987,0.97,5680.341,5707.368,"With that, I will turn it over to my colleague unless there are other questions.",151,,
988,0.97,5707.368,5709.837,I will NOTE what I think other Council members have as well.,152,,
989,0.97,5709.837,5714.875,"We are interested in Scaling this up to the five stations, the five districts that the fire Department has across the city at some point.",152,,
990,0.97,5714.875,5717.111,We want to be thoughtful about how we scale that out.,152,,
991,0.97,5717.111,5719.547,I appreciate very much that this was in the Mayor's proposed budget.,152,,
992,0.97,5719.547,5721.182,I am looking forward to building on that.,152,,
993,0.97,5721.182,5721.782,Go ahead.,153,,
994,0.97,5721.782,5724.819,I have a question about the expansion as proposed by the Mayor's 2021 budget.,154,,
995,0.97,5724.819,5726.821,I think I have a budget question on this.,154,,
996,0.97,5726.821,5727.488,Perhaps you already know.,154,,
997,0.97,5727.488,5737.231,"When they talk about service to North and South, when they talk about South Seattle, are they talking about South Seattle?",154,,
998,0.97,5737.231,5740.301,I do not know but I will find out and get back to you.,155,,
999,0.97,5740.301,5747.575,"Council member Kshama Sawant, is there a question for you?",156,,
1000,0.97,5747.575,5749.61,"I apologize, I should have asked this question earlier.",157,,
1001,0.97,5749.61,5755.449,I had a general Overarching question.,157,,
1002,0.97,5755.449,5760.354,This is a question.,157,,
1003,0.97,5760.354,5761.622,You can ask it.,158,,
1004,0.97,5761.622,5777.872,"Obviously, needless to say, my office totally supports any measures to stop doing further harm with the use of armed officers by not using armed officers.",159,,
1005,0.97,5777.872,5795.489,I also wondered if the staff had any conversation around actual funding for backing up a Nonlaw enforcement model.,159,,
1006,0.97,5795.489,5803.197,"Without actual funding for services, real services and housing, this model cannot actually be effective.",159,,
1007,0.97,5803.197,5805.266,This is very important.,159,,
1008,0.97,5805.266,5813.874,"In order to make it work, they will need to deal with the problem of homelessness, mental health illness.",159,,
1009,0.97,5813.874,5819.713,There is not funding for those.,159,,
1010,0.97,5819.713,5821.115,Things have been gutted at various levels.,159,,
1011,0.97,5821.115,5834.628,That is the underlying problem why the law enforcement aspect has encroached upon every other thing that should be socially addressed.,159,,
1012,0.97,5834.628,5845.873,"So you know, just one example is that if you send mental health professionals to people in crisis, they will have the Úskills.",159,,
1013,0.97,5845.873,5849.376,They also have to be armed with the resources to have a material impact on the actual crisis.,159,,
1014,0.97,5849.376,5863.958,Let's get you somewhere to stay for a little while in order to make sure that you are able to get over this.,159,,
1015,0.97,5863.958,5865.793,Let's make sure you have a hot meal.,159,,
1016,0.97,5865.793,5867.661,Let's make sure you have access to shower and bathrooms.,159,,
1017,0.97,5867.661,5869.096,Let's go do some community social activities.,159,,
1018,0.97,5869.096,5871.265,Let's figure out what you need and that sort of thing.,159,,
1019,0.97,5871.265,5875.336,Here is a comfortable setting where we can talk now and in the future about what is going on.,159,,
1020,0.97,5875.336,5877.171,All of this is going to require tremendous resources.,159,,
1021,0.97,5877.171,5881.942,I was just hoping and I was just wondering if we could shed some light on what has happened about that aspect.,159,,
1022,0.97,5881.942,5888.682,"Council member Kshama Sawant, I also think that Councilmember's Tammy J.",160,,
1023,0.97,5888.682,5898.092,Morales question will shed light on that as well.,160,,
1024,0.97,5898.092,5900.094,We may be able to see an imbalance in funding.,160,,
1025,0.97,5900.094,5914.575,That would be eliminating as well.,160,,
1026,0.97,5914.575,5917.211,The question I think was about overall funding for a more balanced model.,160,,
1027,0.97,5917.211,5919.213,"If you have thoughts on that, they are welcome.",160,,
1028,0.97,5919.213,5922.082,I would like to highlight that I think it Complemented with the Councilmember brought up.,160,,
1029,0.97,5922.082,5922.483,Yes.,161,,
1030,0.97,5922.483,5926.32,I think this is one of the things that we will get to in issue Id as well.,161,,
1031,0.97,5926.32,5929.39,"In talking about the frame of this paper, we zoomed in on these first two intercepts.",161,,
1032,0.97,5929.39,5947.241,"The intent was very much talking about in this little world of here is what happens when there is a crisis, what do you do in that crisis?",161,,
1033,0.97,5947.241,5949.91,"The paper is framed on Okay, here are the responses that currently exist.",161,,
1034,0.97,5949.91,5952.413,Here are the different types of responses that can go moving forward.,161,,
1035,0.97,5952.413,5971.498,"Underlying all of that and maybe that is not clear in this paper, it deals with the fact that there is a difference in philosophies about how to fund all of the Nonlaw enforcement type responses.",161,,
1036,0.97,5971.732,5973.667,Does that come from divesting from the criminal legal system?,161,,
1037,0.97,5973.667,5975.035,Does it come from somewhere else?,161,,
1038,0.97,5975.035,5979.573,"And that particular piece of it, in terms of where the funds should come from is not so much part of this paper.",161,,
1039,0.97,5979.573,5984.011,That is not because it is not an important part of this discussion by any stretch of the imagination.,161,,
1040,0.97,5984.011,5993.587,It is because the frame here is particularly about where to invest instead.,161,,
1041,0.97,5993.587,5997.624,And I am not saying that the conversation about the investment and investment should be fabricated in any way.,161,,
1042,0.97,5997.624,5998.459,It is just that.,161,,
1043,0.97,5998.459,6013.707,"When we get to a conversation about divesting, it is also a broader conversation about where it is those funds are going.",161,,
1044,0.97,6013.707,6015.376,I do not know if that is helpful.,161,,
1045,0.97,6015.376,6018.579,"In terms of frame, we were focusing very much on the response as to what happens.",161,,
1046,0.97,6018.579,6029.089,This is as opposed to backing up from here is the funding that is available to go to those alternative responses.,161,,
1047,0.97,6029.089,6031.125,It is more about which of the responses to invest in.,161,,
1048,0.97,6031.125,6034.795,Thank you very much.,162,,
1049,0.97,6034.795,6035.396,Very helpful.,162,,
1050,0.97,6035.396,6044.538,I think this helps many of the discussions to come.,162,,
1051,0.97,6044.538,6045.539,"Okay, let's keep going.",163,,
1052,0.97,6045.539,6049.443,I will note for folks that we have about one hour and 45 minutes left in this morning's session.,163,,
1053,0.97,6049.443,6062.022,"To the extent that we do not get through each SD, we can roll that over into the afternoon.",163,,
1054,0.97,6062.022,6065.559,I would also want to thank folks for the conversation that we had on homelessness and Covid-19 response.,163,,
1055,0.97,6065.559,6073.367,The Covid-19 response paper Údoes not have any Councilmembe identified.,163,,
1056,0.97,6073.367,6075.869,"If we do not get to Covid-19, we will do that off-line.",163,,
1057,0.97,6075.869,6077.07,I just wanted to offer that.,163,,
1058,0.97,6077.07,6080.14,This is just so that folks did not feel crunched on our time today.,163,,
1059,0.97,6080.14,6093.687,"We were going to really try to make sure that we get through community safety, Hsd and homelessness today.",163,,
1060,0.97,6093.687,6097.458,This is going to be one of the biggest issues to address in the budget in the next month.,163,,
1061,0.97,6097.458,6098.992,Please do not feel pressured for time.,163,,
1062,0.97,6098.992,6101.061,"If you have questions, feel free to keep raising your hands.",163,,
1063,0.97,6101.061,6103.464,"Okay, we turn it back over to central staff, thank you.",163,,
1064,0.97,6103.464,6118.912,"Okay so, the fifth item you will note in changes to the proposed budget deal with the proposed investment to communities, research and capacity building, and community engagement.",164,,
1065,0.97,6118.912,6125.419,"And so, in this section, we will talk through not only the different work groups and Idt's that have been proposed, we will talk about the funding streams that are associated with those.",164,,
1066,0.97,6125.419,6140.834,"The first thing is in the executive order that came out earlier this year, the Mayor's executive order 2210, there were a variety of working groups and Idt's that were identified.",164,,
1067,0.97,6140.834,6144.104,That include everything from a community safety Workgroup with is an internal group to integrate community input.,164,,
1068,0.97,6144.104,6151.812,It deals with how we spend this $100 million proposed for an act audible community's initiative.,164,,
1069,0.97,6151.812,6153.447,It also includes an equitable investment task force.,164,,
1070,0.97,6153.447,6171.331,Úthis is proposed to be comprised of community leaders from the black indigenous and communities of color.,164,,
1071,0.97,6175.035,6177.07,We plan to engage with communities about the $100 million.,164,,
1072,0.97,6177.07,6178.238,There is a functional analysis Idt.,164,,
1073,0.97,6178.238,6180.04,It is intended to advise operational aspects of SPD.,164,,
1074,0.97,6180.04,6184.278,There is a joint community safety Idt.,164,,
1075,0.97,6184.278,6191.785,I am not entirely clear if that is the same thing as one of the Idt's or if it is a combination or something new.,164,,
1076,0.97,6191.785,6212.105,There is $2 million proposed in Hsd for that joint community safety Idt to advise on how to use the $100 million.,164,,
1077,0.97,6212.105,6213.24,There is a functional transfer Idt.,164,,
1078,0.97,6213.24,6215.609,That is going to support the transfer of functions out of SPD.,164,,
1079,0.97,6215.609,6216.41,You discussed this yesterday.,164,,
1080,0.97,6216.41,6218.612,"It deals with moving 911 and victim advocates, all of those.",164,,
1081,0.97,6218.612,6226.553,"To make it a little easier to see where all of those groups land, I am on page 7 of the memo.",164,,
1082,0.97,6226.553,6228.188,They are all broken out that way.,164,,
1083,0.97,6228.188,6235.429,"If we can move to the next slide, I would also like to look at it from the lens of aware funding lands.",164,,
1084,0.97,6235.429,6242.469,"And so, a variety of different streams of funding have been proposed.",164,,
1085,0.97,6242.469,6255.115,"As I mentioned, the $100 million of the equitable initiative is here.",164,,
1086,0.97,6260.32,6262.823,There is the $2 million I mentioned in the human services Department.,164,,
1087,0.97,6262.823,6264.591,That is intended to go towards implementing recommendations.,164,,
1088,0.97,6264.591,6265.959,"This comes out of joint community safety, Idt.",164,,
1089,0.97,6265.959,6267.828,"There is $500,000 in the third quarter supplemental budget.",164,,
1090,0.97,6267.828,6270.43,It is intended to go to the Department and neighborhoods coming from SPD.,164,,
1091,0.97,6270.43,6273.467,That is intended to go to community engagement run by the community safety Workgroup.,164,,
1092,0.97,6273.467,6285.112,There is $14 million that the Council discussed over the summer.,164,,
1093,0.97,6285.112,6287.08,That is intended to move toward services and capacity building.,164,,
1094,0.97,6287.08,6289.283,4 million of that is ready to scale up existing services.,164,,
1095,0.97,6289.283,6300.494,10 million is awaiting community process in order to develop a Rfp . There is $3 million currently within the legislative Department.,164,,
1096,0.97,6300.494,6308.802,That is intended to go towards supporting community research.,164,,
1097,0.97,6308.802,6336.43,These are all of the items that proposed in the 2021 budget or they are currently in play for this group of different letter I littered Dt's or Workgroups to get into.,164,,
1098,0.97,6336.43,6340.1,I will talk a little bit more about the implications of that when we get to issue Id.,164,,
1099,0.97,6340.1,6342.936,The intent is to lay out all of these different groups and funding streams.,164,,
1100,0.97,6342.936,6345.405,It will be a little bit easier to understand where everything lands.,164,,
1101,0.97,6345.405,6348.442,I am not sure if there are any questions about that at this moment.,164,,
1102,0.97,6348.442,6350.844,I will get into it when we get into issue Id as well.,164,,
1103,0.97,6350.844,6351.845,Are there questions?,165,,
1104,0.97,6351.845,6352.913,"All right, I have a few.",165,,
1105,0.97,6352.913,6354.314,I am going back one slide.,165,,
1106,0.97,6354.314,6356.35,I thank you for the chart that shows where funding goes.,165,,
1107,0.97,6356.35,6364.691,"I would like to confirm on number one, on number three, and number five, I do not the dollar amounts associated.",165,,
1108,0.97,6364.691,6366.526,I see half 1 million associated with number two.,165,,
1109,0.97,6366.526,6369.763,This is the community safety Workgroup.,165,,
1110,0.97,6369.763,6371.565,You raised some questions about how that fits in.,165,,
1111,0.97,6371.565,6384.111,I see 2 million associated with the joint community safety task force.,165,,
1112,0.97,6384.111,6385.779,"Is there funding associated with one, three, and five?",165,,
1113,0.97,6385.779,6390.083,I do not believe that there is funding associated with the s letter the D functional analysis letter I Dt.,166,,
1114,0.97,6390.083,6408.301,"Those two are intended to be, from my understanding of the executive order, internal teams.",166,,
1115,0.97,6408.301,6410.604,They are supposed to be advising on the technical aspects of things.,166,,
1116,0.97,6410.604,6419.112,"The first piece, the Equitable investment task force, and this is where there is confusion about where this is the task force, how that fits into the joint community safety Idt.",166,,
1117,0.97,6419.112,6430.09,"That $2 million is intended to come from the piece around, excuse me, the $2 million is allocated to the joint community safety Idt.",166,,
1118,0.97,6430.09,6445.939,This is supposed to be for implemented recommendations from that group . I believe the Equitable investment task force is going to be part of the process that figures out what the recommendations are about how the $100 million should be spent.,166,,
1119,0.97,6445.939,6451.411,There is not a lot of clarity about what the $2 million is intended to do.,166,,
1120,0.97,6451.411,6452.879,This is considering the Equitable investment task force.,166,,
1121,0.97,6452.879,6463.824,They are supposed to do recommendations about the $100 million.,166,,
1122,0.97,6463.824,6465.292,That does provide a lot of clarity.,166,,
1123,0.97,6465.292,6467.461,I think that this is part of the issue Id peace.,166,,
1124,0.97,6467.461,6468.061,It is confusing.,166,,
1125,0.97,6468.061,6469.462,"Yes, this is very helpful.",167,,
1126,0.97,6469.462,6477.838,"Is there any money associated in this budget for the Equitable investment task force to convene, to pay people, to do the research?",167,,
1127,0.97,6477.838,6481.675,Is there anything like that?,167,,
1128,0.97,6481.675,6503.196,"It is possible that the $500,000 that is in the third quarter supplemental that the community safety Workgroup with use in conjunction with that task force, that could be what the $500,000 is four.",168,,
1129,0.97,6503.196,6504.331,It could be for community engagement.,168,,
1130,0.97,6504.331,6506.266,"Again, I am not entirely sure about the connection there.",168,,
1131,0.97,6506.266,6510.904,"If there was going to be funding that goes towards that, I believe that was the $500,000.",168,,
1132,0.97,6510.904,6511.905,"Okay, thank you.",169,,
1133,0.97,6511.905,6521.481,"And then, on the next slide from page 8 in the memo, it is either for central staff or it is for the Council colleagues.",169,,
1134,0.97,6521.481,6526.72,Can we get a quick status up date on the two items in the $14 million bucket there?,169,,
1135,0.97,6526.72,6541.301,It deals with where we are at with the $10 million process.,169,,
1136,0.97,6546.973,6549.109,We can try to get those dollars out to the community.,169,,
1137,0.97,6549.109,6551.945,I believe that the 4 million is being processed and getting out the door.,169,,
1138,0.97,6551.945,6555.415,"If there is an update, we can offer it for the public and that would be helpful.",169,,
1139,0.97,6555.415,6562.122,That 10 million . An update on this memo is essentially drawn from the letter that came from the Mayor's office about what the status of that was.,169,,
1140,0.97,6562.122,6565.725,"If Council members have more up to date information about that, that would be wear that update lands.",169,,
1141,0.97,6565.725,6567.227,Feel free to jump in.,170,,
1142,0.97,6567.227,6582.442,I am just jumping in to say that I have been trying to get time with direct or Johnson for a couple of weeks.,171,,
1143,0.97,6582.442,6584.244,It would be to discuss just this issue.,171,,
1144,0.97,6584.244,6604.03,My monthly meetings that I have with director Johnson were canceled because we are in the budget process.,171,,
1145,0.97,6604.03,6605.599,"I was like no, we can still meet.",171,,
1146,0.97,6605.599,6608.068,We just are not supposed to talk about the 2021 budget issues.,171,,
1147,0.97,6608.068,6609.669,This is one of those Non-2021 budget issues.,171,,
1148,0.97,6609.669,6612.305,It is related to the funding that we have provided and 2020.,171,,
1149,0.97,6612.305,6619.012,I am working really hard to get clarity on what the process is for getting those dollars out the door.,171,,
1150,0.97,6619.012,6621.748,It deals with what the process is for developing the Rp it's self.,171,,
1151,0.97,6621.748,6627.721,I have been suggesting to the community that they might want to consider convening themselves.,171,,
1152,0.97,6627.721,6630.156,This would be rather than waiting to be convened by the city.,171,,
1153,0.97,6630.156,6636.229,They could convene themselves and make some recommendations for what they letter Rp looks like.,171,,
1154,0.97,6636.229,6639.332,I feel a lot of anxiety around getting these $10 million out the door.,171,,
1155,0.97,6639.332,6647.841,We are a a few steps away from that.,171,,
1156,0.97,6647.841,6648.842,Hsd is making a proposal.,171,,
1157,0.97,6648.842,6653.747,I believe that we need to bring the community together to develop the Rp.,171,,
1158,0.97,6653.747,6656.149,Thank you Councilmember.,172,,
1159,0.97,6656.149,6687.247,"And then on the first line, Councilmember Tammy J. Morales, if you have any updates, I am interested in the status updates on the $3 million that the Department is working on.",172,,
1160,0.97,6687.247,6690.884,I know that this is something that you and Councilmember Lisa Herbold have been working on it.,172,,
1161,0.97,6690.884,6694.154,I believe it might be helpful to have an update on how the process is going.,172,,
1162,0.97,6694.154,6697.991,We are very close to getting a signed contract and being able to get that out the door.,173,,
1163,0.97,6697.991,6699.592,There is a meeting this afternoon.,173,,
1164,0.97,6699.592,6701.494,It is to get final approval from the law Department.,173,,
1165,0.97,6701.494,6703.897,My deep hope is that we can get that accomplished this week.,173,,
1166,0.97,6703.897,6705.698,We can get that money out the door soon.,173,,
1167,0.97,6705.698,6706.132,Excellent.,174,,
1168,0.97,6706.132,6707.3,That is very helpful to hear.,174,,
1169,0.97,6707.3,6710.203,Thank you for your work on that effort.,174,,
1170,0.97,6710.203,6713.873,It would be still helpful for me if we had some form of a Matrix like a Flowchart.,174,,
1171,0.97,6713.873,6731.524,This is even though we do not fully understand where each of the elements on page 7 of the memo flow together to try our best to visually represent that.,174,,
1172,0.97,6731.524,6732.525,Perhaps I am jumping ahead.,174,,
1173,0.97,6732.525,6733.726,I see Allie is on here.,174,,
1174,0.97,6733.726,6735.195,Please feel free to jump in.,174,,
1175,0.97,6735.195,6744.137,This is very helpful.,174,,
1176,0.97,6744.137,6747.941,Thank you for your work to help Dissect where the dollars are going and what the proposed bodies are.,174,,
1177,0.97,6747.941,6750.777,"I think visually, it might be helpful to see where that flows together.",174,,
1178,0.97,6750.777,6759.152,"Councilmember, I just wanted to highlight for Council members that the $14 million, 10 million in particular is one of the pieces where the executive is moving forward.",175,,
1179,0.97,6759.152,6762.355,Hold that microphone right up to your mouth if you can.,176,,
1180,0.97,6762.355,6766.259,That is better.,176,,
1181,0.97,6766.259,6768.261,I am having all sorts of technology issues today.,177,,
1182,0.97,6768.261,6774.701,I would just like to know that I do not have any additional information beyond what Councilmember Lisa Herbold described.,177,,
1183,0.97,6774.701,6776.77,We do not know where they are with the $10 million.,177,,
1184,0.97,6776.77,6784.944,This is the piece of the 2020 budget revision ordinance that the executive has said they are moving forward with the spending authorized by the counsel.,177,,
1185,0.97,6784.944,6802.362,They have not executed the loan in order to support those investments.,177,,
1186,0.97,6802.362,6805.265,That is part of the issue with the starting ballot for the 2021 proposed budget.,177,,
1187,0.97,6805.265,6819.712,"And also, I just wanted to note that I understand and I think the $2 million listed here is probably not moving forward.",177,,
1188,0.97,6822.982,6828.822,The $2 million listed here is a relic of the compromise or the alternative budget revision ordinance that was being contemplated prior to the counsel over writing the veto.,177,,
1189,0.97,6828.822,6833.026,That $2 million was going to go to Hsd and one was going to go to ledge for Participatory budgeting.,177,,
1190,0.97,6833.026,6837.53,My understanding is that may be a duplicate could be there for other purposes.,177,,
1191,0.97,6837.53,6839.332,"Councilmember Lisa Herbold, comments from you?",178,,
1192,0.97,6839.332,6853.613,"As it relates specifically to this issue, the fact that the Interfund loan has not been, it has not been implemented per the Council's direction.",179,,
1193,0.97,6853.613,6869.863,We have got a $14 million hole in the proposed 2021 budget . I am assuming that is identified in the issue Id with some solutions that we have just not gotten to yet.,179,,
1194,0.97,6869.863,6880.573,"Councilmember Lisa Herbold, that was highlighted in the information on the general fund balancing process last week.",180,,
1195,0.97,6880.573,6882.041,There were some options that were identified.,180,,
1196,0.97,6882.041,6885.478,We will be working with the budget share and all of you to help address that issue.,180,,
1197,0.97,6885.478,6908.201,"One strategy is that these are investments in community that you could consider using a portion of the proposed $100 million, proposed by the Mayor to support the investments that were already committed to by the counsel.",180,,
1198,0.97,6908.201,6909.068,This is one strategy.,180,,
1199,0.97,6909.068,6910.67,We can talk off-line about additional ones.,180,,
1200,0.97,6910.67,6923.349,"Thank you, I am really interested in addressing this issue.",181,,
1201,0.97,6926.986,6929.122,I am struggling with the consequences of not addressing it.,181,,
1202,0.97,6929.122,6938.331,"At first, I was sort of like Okay, well, if the Mayor is saying that they are going to get the dollars out the door, there is nothing we can do about the fact that they have not taken alone.",181,,
1203,0.97,6938.331,6957.15,"I can imagine a situation where they could say, they could work with community to identify what the contract should say . This is in the case of item 4. there is the $4 million item.",181,,
1204,0.97,6957.15,6958.818,They could work with community to develop the Rfp.,181,,
1205,0.97,6958.818,6970.93,"They could at some point, when it comes time to start funding, they could make the dollars flow.",181,,
1206,0.97,6970.93,6975.234,I could see a situation where they might say that the counsel did not make the dollars available.,181,,
1207,0.97,6975.234,6978.638,I am feeling much more motivated to figure out how to solve that problem.,181,,
1208,0.97,6978.638,6996.255,"And, do we know if there has ever been a situation in recent history where the Mayor has proposed an unbalanced budget?",181,,
1209,0.97,6996.255,6997.39,I cannot speak to that.,182,,
1210,0.97,6997.39,7004.497,I will say that one of the challenges here is to have the Council take up the veto.,182,,
1211,0.97,7004.497,7022.181,"It deals with when the budget office was sending the budget, they have been transmitting the budget to the counsel.",182,,
1212,0.97,7022.181,7023.216,I just want to acknowledge that.,182,,
1213,0.97,7023.216,7024.817,I see that the director has joined us.,182,,
1214,0.97,7024.817,7026.285,He may have more to add here.,182,,
1215,0.97,7026.285,7027.487,"Excuse me, thank you Allie.",183,,
1216,0.97,7027.487,7051.844,"The idea that the money is going to begin to flow, I think that is the important one.",183,,
1217,0.97,7051.844,7056.315,I do not think it is likely that the $10 million is going to be spent by the end of this year.,183,,
1218,0.97,7056.315,7064.09,"It seems much more likely to me that the Rfp process would take up enough time that there would not be a sufficient number of days, weeks, and months left in 2024 all of the money to be spent.",183,,
1219,0.97,7064.09,7065.858,There could be a commitment to spend the funds.,183,,
1220,0.97,7065.858,7069.395,"That commitment could have, you know, it could take shape and be formed in a binding contract.",183,,
1221,0.97,7069.395,7070.963,That would take some portion of 2021.,183,,
1222,0.97,7070.963,7072.031,This could actually spend the dollars.,183,,
1223,0.97,7072.031,7086.813,"To the extent that there is a problem with balancing the budget, there is the commitment that would have been made in 2020.",183,,
1224,0.97,7086.813,7088.581,"Then in 2021, there is the actual cash problem.",183,,
1225,0.97,7088.581,7096.155,Allie mentioned that one of the strategies that was identified in an earlier issue Id session was to essentially allocate a portion of the $100 million that the Mayor has proposed.,183,,
1226,0.97,7096.155,7109.702,Another proposed solution to the problem that has been identified might be to authorize an additional Interfund loan.,183,,
1227,0.97,7109.702,7111.604,This would certainly need to be repaid at some point.,183,,
1228,0.97,7111.604,7117.877,"You know, this would have to happen in 2022.",183,,
1229,0.97,7117.877,7120.313,That and beyond would be the time to regain the Interfund loan.,183,,
1230,0.97,7120.313,7134.927,That would at least provide a budget that is fully balancing the anticipated expenditures with reasonably anticipated revenues.,183,,
1231,0.97,7134.927,7139.332,"It is possible that the Mayor may choose not to again, take the Interfund loan that has been authorized.",183,,
1232,0.97,7139.332,7149.542,That is merely providing an authorization.,183,,
1233,0.97,7149.542,7151.477,She has to choose what to do without authorization.,183,,
1234,0.97,7151.477,7152.912,The budget would be balanced in any event.,183,,
1235,0.97,7152.912,7153.412,Thank you.,184,,
1236,0.97,7153.412,7164.757,"Thank you all . Amy, please go ahead.",185,,
1237,0.97,7164.757,7167.827,I just wanted to clarify one quick thing related to the $4 million.,186,,
1238,0.97,7167.827,7174.233,"We did hear from Hsd this morning that rather than issue a Rfp for the $4 million to expand services, what they would prefer to do is to contract with existing providers.",186,,
1239,0.97,7174.233,7177.77,This is so that they can get those funds out more quickly.,186,,
1240,0.97,7177.77,7189.348,I just wanted to clarify that one very small point.,186,,
1241,0.97,7193.052,7194.72,Thank you Amy for that clarification.,187,,
1242,0.97,7194.72,7197.69,This is a helpful point for us to make sure that we understand that as well.,187,,
1243,0.97,7197.69,7198.691,"Council members, please Chime in.",187,,
1244,0.97,7198.691,7203.996,"I believe that was part of the intent as well, this is with existing organizations who do gun violence reduction strategies within the community.",187,,
1245,0.97,7203.996,7206.198,This is for them to be able to scale that up.,187,,
1246,0.97,7206.198,7207.199,Is that correct Council members?,187,,
1247,0.97,7207.199,7209.368,I can see Councilmember Lisa Herbold nodding.,187,,
1248,0.97,7209.368,7215.174,"The question that I have, is that are they asking for some sort of clarification from us.",188,,
1249,0.97,7215.174,7226.419,This particular slide does referred to an abbreviated Rfp process.,188,,
1250,0.97,7226.419,7234.427,It refers to an abbreviated Rfp process that is intended to only be used to scale up the funding of currently contracted organizations.,188,,
1251,0.97,7234.427,7246.772,Are you suggesting that they need some sort of a green light from us before finalizing these contracts?,188,,
1252,0.97,7246.772,7255.147,I was under the impression from talking to folks in the community that they were at the contract expansion signing point.,188,,
1253,0.97,7255.147,7256.816,"Yes, I think that is absolutely correct.",189,,
1254,0.97,7256.816,7265.157,I just wanted to clarify what is actually happening is a little bit different than what is represented on this slide.,189,,
1255,0.97,7265.157,7275.868,This is so that there is no confusion about that.,189,,
1256,0.97,7275.868,7277.536,"Okay, this has been very helpful.",190,,
1257,0.97,7277.536,7279.372,Thank you very much for the patience of central Star.,190,,
1258,0.97,7279.372,7280.673,We walked through these various questions.,190,,
1259,0.97,7280.673,7294.02,Thank you for your engagement on this base level understanding of the community safety memo.,190,,
1260,0.97,7294.854,7296.522,We are going to move now into issue identification.,190,,
1261,0.97,7296.522,7298.257,I will turn it back over to you.,190,,
1262,0.97,7298.257,7299.859,I present to you the next slide.,191,,
1263,0.97,7299.859,7305.097,The first issue we are looking at is something that I think you all have been talking about as we have been going through the memo.,191,,
1264,0.97,7305.097,7307.9,It is the decision about what and how to fund these different intercepts.,191,,
1265,0.97,7307.9,7314.006,We were looking at the actual available services.,191,,
1266,0.97,7314.006,7315.908,It came down to dividing this into three separate categories.,191,,
1267,0.97,7315.908,7319.745,"First, it deals with what is the appropriate function of government compared to the function of Community-Based services?",191,,
1268,0.97,7319.745,7341.434,"With in the appropriate scope you decide the governmental function is, what is the appropriate scope of what should be handled by law enforcement?",191,,
1269,0.97,7341.434,7342.601,What should be handled by Nonlaw enforcement?,191,,
1270,0.97,7342.601,7346.338,"Within law enforcement, what should be handled by sworn officers and what should be addressed by Non-Sworn officers?",191,,
1271,0.97,7346.338,7348.874,"And so, laid out in Table one, a variety of different services exist.",191,,
1272,0.97,7348.874,7352.745,"You have been talking in other budget deliberations, discussions about the scope of things like the parking enforcement officers.",191,,
1273,0.97,7352.745,7358.35,All of those really are what this issue Id is really about.,191,,
1274,0.97,7358.35,7360.753,We played out a couple general options for what you can do.,191,,
1275,0.97,7360.753,7369.929,This is obviously not a mutually exclusive list.,191,,
1276,0.97,7369.929,7377.169,"The first option would be to expand intercepts zero services, community services, in an attempt to prevent the need for people to be able to get to the point where they need to call 911.",191,,
1277,0.97,7377.169,7382.041,This would decrease the opportunities for eventual collision with law enforcement.,191,,
1278,0.97,7382.041,7393.719,The second option B would be to expand intercepts .5 services.,191,,
1279,0.97,7396.222,7397.79,We are increasing the governmental response to 911.,191,,
1280,0.97,7397.79,7399.592,This is again where health one might fit in.,191,,
1281,0.97,7399.592,7402.294,This would expand responses so that we are avoiding the law enforcement response.,191,,
1282,0.97,7402.294,7403.496,And then there is option C.,191,,
1283,0.97,7403.496,7405.364,This would be to expand the law enforcement response.,191,,
1284,0.97,7405.364,7407.7,This is with those responses that are paired with crisis response.,191,,
1285,0.97,7407.7,7425.885,It would not necessarily decrease when law enforcement responded to a call but it could mitigate potential harm from having law enforcement respond.,191,,
1286,0.97,7425.885,7430.289,"The next option D would be to take no action, it would be to adopt the budget as proposed by the Mayor.",191,,
1287,0.97,7430.289,7447.139,"Thank you, colleagues, I also offer the potential option of letter E. this is some combination of a, B, C. these are not mutually exclusive.",192,,
1288,0.97,7447.139,7449.942,I want to make sure that we have that on the radar as well.,192,,
1289,0.97,7449.942,7452.011,We need various elements that we have been talking about.,192,,
1290,0.97,7452.011,7455.181,"This could fit in with a, B, or C. we can think about a combination.",192,,
1291,0.97,7455.181,7455.848,Councilmember Lisa Herbold?,192,,
1292,0.97,7455.848,7466.826,"As it relates specifically to option a, or option letter E, since it would include a; I would like to clarify that the leader defines itself as an intercepts 0 service.",193,,
1293,0.97,7466.826,7478.17,This is not the sort of hybrid between 0 and 1. they are taking referrals from community members.,193,,
1294,0.97,7478.17,7486.946,That is the way the models work.,193,,
1295,0.97,7486.946,7495.087,"They receive, they might, historically, they might have had SPD approve the referrals.",193,,
1296,0.97,7495.087,7499.692,They are receiving referrals both from officers in the field and from community members.,193,,
1297,0.97,7499.692,7517.209,"Because it does not require, there is not a necessity to call the police for a service in order to get the services, they consider themselves and intercept 0 service.",193,,
1298,0.97,7517.209,7520.145,"Councilmember, did you have a comment?",194,,
1299,0.97,7520.145,7532.825,"I have a quick comment, as I am Foreshadowing issue number three.",195,,
1300,0.97,7532.825,7534.093,This is with the Rsji lends.,195,,
1301,0.97,7534.093,7555.114,"If we are going to make our decisions using the framework and focusing on Antiracist principles, then in my mind, we need to invest the bulk of that to go toward letter a or B. we need to make sure that we are moving as far as possible from increasing investment in something that would involve engagement with law enforcement for the most vulnerable in the community.",195,,
1302,0.97,7555.114,7562.721,Thank you very much.,196,,
1303,0.97,7562.721,7564.757,"Okay, I see no additional comments or questions on this.",196,,
1304,0.97,7564.757,7565.758,Let's do issue number two.,196,,
1305,0.97,7565.758,7571.03,This is on page 9 of the memo.,196,,
1306,0.97,7571.03,7581.173,Hello again Council members.,197,,
1307,0.97,7581.173,7582.508,Issue number two is help one expansion.,197,,
1308,0.97,7582.508,7587.88,"In the 2021 budget, there would be 571,000 added to the Seattle fire Department.",197,,
1309,0.97,7587.88,7590.749,This would support an additional team and expand operating hours and geographic coverage.,197,,
1310,0.97,7590.749,7600.492,"One thing I will note is that this 575,000 would be in addition to the 400,000 that is already funding the unit.",197,,
1311,0.97,7600.492,7603.395,"And with that, I would say that there are two potential issues for consideration.",197,,
1312,0.97,7603.395,7613.706,"First, counsel make consider requesting that the scope of skulls be expanded.",197,,
1313,0.97,7613.706,7617.776,"Currently, the dispatch COMPLETES primary 911 screening and they were attend a majority of wellness checks and behavioral health crisis.",197,,
1314,0.97,7617.776,7628.153,Spd has a limited number of crisis intervention teams to respond to behavioral health calls.,197,,
1315,0.97,7628.153,7631.623,Health one provides an additional resource for wellness checks and behavioral calls that do not involve sworn officers.,197,,
1316,0.97,7631.623,7642.501,"In contrast, other cities like Eugene Oregon deal with crisis assistance helping out on the streets.",197,,
1317,0.97,7642.501,7643.535,They are known as cahoots.,197,,
1318,0.97,7643.535,7645.537,They deal with nonviolent situations with a behavioral health client.,197,,
1319,0.97,7645.537,7647.039,The proposal will expand Nonpolice 911 alternatives.,197,,
1320,0.97,7647.039,7667.559,This overlaps with work funded by Council that deals with budget rebalancing.,197,,
1321,0.97,7667.559,7670.963,Community-Based organizations can explore how to scale a response system to identify resources necessary to accomplish work.,197,,
1322,0.97,7670.963,7676.035,"In several of the city's previous community engagement sessions regarding criminal justice reform, participants have expressed that the city needed to engage in Community- based solutions.",197,,
1323,0.97,7676.035,7696.989,One recommendation was that the city partner with Community- based organizations to ensure accountability and cultural competence in both program design and operation.,197,,
1324,0.97,7696.989,7704.463,"As the process is adopted in the beginning stages, it is unclear at this point whether or to what expand expanding health one will align with the proposals that will be generated by the community process.",197,,
1325,0.97,7704.463,7710.402,"Additionally, if the Councilmember wants to initiate an alternative model based on recommendations, doing so may be come more challenges if the city is already committed to expanding the model.",197,,
1326,0.97,7710.402,7711.97,"With that, we played out three options.",197,,
1327,0.97,7711.97,7717.309,Option letter a would be to appropriate additional funds to expand health one while adding and restricting funds until the executive Revamps the protocol.,197,,
1328,0.97,7717.309,7729.488,Option B would be to set aside the proposed funding and general reserves until the Community-Based groups report on recommendations.,197,,
1329,0.97,7729.488,7733.325,Action C would be no action and to adopt the proposed budget as it was laid out by the Mayor.,197,,
1330,0.97,7733.325,7741.233,Thank you very much Carlos.,198,,
1331,0.97,7741.233,7746.638,I appreciate your walking through the proposals in front of us and also I think this complements the confirmation that we had about 45 minutes ago.,198,,
1332,0.97,7746.638,7748.14,I would like to add something to this.,198,,
1333,0.97,7748.14,7772.131,I think that there is the potential for an us not to see this as an either or but an interim as we ramp up some of those more community driven response models.,198,,
1334,0.97,7772.131,7778.637,"We need to recognize right now that if we do not ramp up health one, this is a model that is ready to be held be brought to scale at a quicker pace.",198,,
1335,0.97,7778.637,7793.919,We are going to continue to see our personnel show up where we could have more mental health case manager showing up with the public health lends.,198,,
1336,0.97,7804.463,7806.064,They are equipped to do the work now.,198,,
1337,0.97,7806.064,7811.97,"I appreciate the conversation that we just had and I would like to add to something that I think Greg and Carlos and Amy, you all were flagging this.",198,,
1338,0.97,7811.97,7818.61,This is potentially that we could change the protocol within 911 to trigger the calls to health one to be more responsive to calls that they are not currently getting dispatched to.,198,,
1339,0.97,7818.61,7843.435,"Instead of improvising as one Articulates, we could appropriate funds and at protocol or policy to both create a more I do not know, accurate use of the 911 systems for deploying health one and also couple this with one of the formulas that is coming up by Councilmember Lewis to include additional personnel at 911 to help triage calls.",198,,
1340,0.97,7843.435,7845.103,I would like to offer that to folks.,198,,
1341,0.97,7845.103,7851.143,"I would not want us to have behavioral health calls, I am sorry.",198,,
1342,0.97,7851.143,7857.249,"Elder neglect calls, things like that, they could have sworn personnel, we have such an incredible team that shows up.",198,,
1343,0.97,7857.249,7872.064,"I think perhaps, a protocol for a 911 dispatch might be a nice addition therefore an option.",198,,
1344,0.97,7872.931,7873.799,"Councilmember Lewis, please go ahead.",198,,
1345,0.97,7873.799,7874.533,"Yes, thank you.",199,,
1346,0.97,7874.533,7876.969,I just wanted to jump in and echo your sentiments on this.,199,,
1347,0.97,7876.969,7882.441,This is based on my engagement with health one . It deals with studying some of these other systems.,199,,
1348,0.97,7882.441,7900.692,One of the things that they raised to me which was interesting is that it would not necessarily be mutually exclusive with our community envisioning process to scale up health one then to also decide that we want to invest in similar low Acuity Provider- based responses.,199,,
1349,0.97,7900.692,7911.069,Health one chick from my conversation can be dealt with a model like that.,199,,
1350,0.97,7911.069,7914.373,Health one could arrive and flag a call as being more appropriate for like A.D.,199,,
1351,0.97,7914.373,7918.176,Sc base.,199,,
1352,0.97,7918.176,7922.014,This could be a first response or even vice versa.,199,,
1353,0.97,7922.014,7931.79,There could be ways to develop the scope of work.,199,,
1354,0.97,7931.79,7933.625,This could also invest in a system like that.,199,,
1355,0.97,7933.625,7934.826,They are super available to it.,199,,
1356,0.97,7934.826,7957.916,I do not think that it would unduly commit us too much to invest now in Scaling up something that is ready to be scaled up and can alleviate real harm in the community.,199,,
1357,0.97,7966.992,7972.831,"I do not think in this budget cycle, we should take a pass on being able to expand a service that can alleviate very real human suffering in the city.",199,,
1358,0.97,7972.831,7981.773,I think that it could also be helpful for the community Visioning process to provide this as a data point at something they can look at on what the impact and effect of the scale of this had and recommending how to improve it.,199,,
1359,0.97,7981.773,7985.177,I agree with all of the sentiment you just expressed and I wanted to add my support.,199,,
1360,0.97,7985.177,7986.078,Thank you Councilmember.,200,,
1361,0.97,7986.078,7986.645,Any additional comments?,200,,
1362,0.97,7986.645,7987.546,Councilmember Lisa Herbold?,200,,
1363,0.97,7987.546,7996.988,"This gets back to my earlier request of the current staffing under health one, do we have an estimate of the percentage of 911 calls?",201,,
1364,0.97,7996.988,7997.989,How many can be diverted?,201,,
1365,0.97,7997.989,8013.472,Do we have an estimate of how much the Mayor's proposed expansion would increase that percentage of diversion from traditional 911 response.,201,,
1366,0.97,8013.472,8017.009,"You know, this budget does include an expansion.",201,,
1367,0.97,8017.009,8025.65,It excludes an expansion of health one.,201,,
1368,0.97,8025.65,8050.409,"I guess before we talk about expanding it even further beyond what is in the budget, I would like to have a little bit better of an understanding of the ability of additional expansions to meet our shared goals here on the counsel.",201,,
1369,0.97,8050.409,8060.919,"I am also wondering if there might be other disciplines, crisis response disciplines that we want to focus our resources on.",201,,
1370,0.97,8060.919,8075.767,This is beyond what the health one response can currently provide.,201,,
1371,0.97,8075.767,8081.673,"This is as it relates to a health response or potentially in the future, more of a mental health response.",201,,
1372,0.97,8081.673,8096.488,I think there are other crisis response disciplines that might be more important to work on investing and trying to connect 2911.,201,,
1373,0.97,8096.488,8124.115,"I would be really, I would really appreciate having a little bit more data about the current health one program and the number of calls that they take and what we anticipate under the Mayor's proposed expansion.",201,,
1374,0.97,8124.115,8127.619,I would be happy to compile all of that and send that out to you all.,202,,
1375,0.97,8127.619,8130.222,I do not think we have it in an easily digestible format.,202,,
1376,0.97,8130.222,8131.523,"Excellent, thank you very much.",203,,
1377,0.97,8131.523,8137.329,I am not seeing additional questions or comments.,203,,
1378,0.97,8137.329,8138.997,"Councilmember Tammy J. Morales, did you have something?",203,,
1379,0.97,8138.997,8146.705,"Yes, I would like to echo the bridal point that Councilmember Lisa Herbold is making.",204,,
1380,0.97,8146.705,8151.943,There is a lot on the table here.,204,,
1381,0.97,8151.943,8181.84,"I think that we need to be cautious or just aware of the fact that you know, these all have broad outcomes and the bigger goal or the longer-term outcome is better safety, you know, violence prevention and the policymaking that we are doing through this process.",204,,
1382,0.97,8181.84,8183.875,It is going to have some long- term effects for folks.,204,,
1383,0.97,8183.875,8190.382,"I just, I appreciate what the Councilmember is saying.",204,,
1384,0.97,8190.382,8200.692,"As we are making these decisions, we should not be making them on individual programs necessarily but on what they mean for the bigger long-term outcomes that we are looking for.",204,,
1385,0.97,8200.692,8201.359,"Okay, excellent.",205,,
1386,0.97,8201.359,8210.902,Let's keep moving.,205,,
1387,0.97,8210.902,8212.704,"Excuse me, we are moving to the next slide.",205,,
1388,0.97,8212.704,8213.705,This is issue number three.,205,,
1389,0.97,8213.705,8226.117,We are talking about all the potential duplication of community efforts around engagement and research.,205,,
1390,0.97,8226.117,8242.267,"And so as I have mentioned, when we were talking about changes to the 2021 proposed budget, there are a variety of Workgroups, there are a variety of Idt.",205,,
1391,0.97,8243.868,8246.037,There are different approaches to Disinvestment in the criminal legal system.,205,,
1392,0.97,8246.037,8250.508,All of that has made clear that there is a difference in the values that are underlying what the proposals have been.,205,,
1393,0.97,8250.508,8262.52,"It is not only a difference in the principles that are governing these proposals but also, it is understanding and analysis of diversity versus Antiracism.",205,,
1394,0.97,8262.52,8267.359,It is about the role of impacted communities in analysis and decision-making.,205,,
1395,0.97,8267.359,8290.281,"And so, for context, I would like to talk through some of the concerns that have come up in previous years and how counsel has attempted to get us to a place of more aligned values and principles and how that has gotten us to the analysis that we are looking at today.",205,,
1396,0.97,8290.281,8310.435,"So deliberations regarding the 2019 proposed budget, one of the issues that came up was that there were not any values or principles that were holding together all of the different initiatives, funding, Workgroups that were formed across the city intended to address either crime prevention or criminal justice generally, the criminal legal system.",205,,
1397,0.97,8310.435,8331.389,And so what prompted the criminal legal system alignment project that Carlos and another individual are running is this concern.,205,,
1398,0.97,8332.19,8340.031,The idea was to look at all of these different things that we are doing as a city and come together by centering them in Antiracist principles so that we can ask the same questions over and over again.,205,,
1399,0.97,8340.031,8362.62,This is without looking at we already have.,205,,
1400,0.97,8362.62,8365.657,This spring from recommendations coming out of the 2018 report from the Reentry work group.,205,,
1401,0.97,8365.657,8370.562,That work group was commissioned to provide recommendations to the city about how to support individuals that were Reentering society after being incarcerated.,205,,
1402,0.97,8370.562,8377.268,"One of their recommendations was to have all of the branches, all four branches of the city government work together to build a strategy.",205,,
1403,0.97,8377.268,8381.539,This would be something that is aligned and working in partnership with the communities most impacted by the criminal legal system.,205,,
1404,0.97,8381.539,8383.007,That was the formation of that project.,205,,
1405,0.97,8383.007,8389.247,This is a project that is currently under way.,205,,
1406,0.97,8389.247,8395.553,"And, the other thing that came up during the 2019 proposed budget was a call to defend probation.",205,,
1407,0.97,8395.553,8416.808,"And in response to that call, the consul added $1.8 million to the budget of the office for civil rights to support organizations that were researching and standing up alternatives to the criminal legal system.",205,,
1408,0.97,8416.808,8420.912,The funding was specified by the Council to go to organizations that were focused on achieving health and reconciliation.,205,,
1409,0.97,8420.912,8422.914,This is addressing the harm done by the legal system.,205,,
1410,0.97,8422.914,8427.418,I note that the 2021 proposed budget cuts these funds.,205,,
1411,0.97,8427.418,8429.02,These are intended to be ongoing funds.,205,,
1412,0.97,8429.02,8439.197,This was when they were added to the budget in 2020.,205,,
1413,0.97,8439.197,8443.468,"I also wanted to note, the 2020 proposed budget included a variety of recommendations from the high barrier individuals work group.",205,,
1414,0.97,8443.468,8456.047,This was a work group intended to come up with recommendations about how to address utilizes of the criminal legal system.,205,,
1415,0.97,8456.047,8468.86,"And those proposals were to fund enhanced shelters at the King County jail, provide a county attorney to the attorney's office as well as place a rapid Reentry Connector in the jail and start a high barrier probation program.",205,,
1416,0.97,8468.86,8481.306,"During counsel's discussions, they expressed concerns about the latter three proposals.",205,,
1417,0.97,8482.54,8484.742,Everybody was in agreement that the shelter is always a good thing.,205,,
1418,0.97,8484.742,8486.878,"The latter three proposals, there were concerns about to these.",205,,
1419,0.97,8486.878,8490.782,The concerns were essentially that these proposals came up that were formed by the worker.,205,,
1420,0.97,8490.782,8501.759,They were not done in conjunction with the alignment work that I just mentioned.,205,,
1421,0.97,8501.759,8503.928,That is happening between counsel and the office of civil rights.,205,,
1422,0.97,8503.928,8509.067,It was not clear how these recommendations were based on values and principles as brought up by the rancher recommendations.,205,,
1423,0.97,8509.067,8516.574,"And the Council ended up cutting the funds for the probation program, moving those to support alignment work, the alignment project, this was an engagement that was taking place there.",205,,
1424,0.97,8516.574,8530.588,They also put restrictions on the various areas.,205,,
1425,0.97,8530.588,8539.831,"The funds for the rapid Reentry Connector and the case Conferencing Atorney were on improvised until the executive came back with among other things, a racial inequity analysis.",205,,
1426,0.97,8539.831,8542.467,This dealt with how the proposal is aligned with the city's proposal.,205,,
1427,0.97,8542.467,8557.549,"In this year's office budget, the third order supplemental, it cuts the funds for the Reentry Connector and the case Conferencing attorney.",205,,
1428,0.97,8557.549,8571.829,There was never ending analysis that was provided to the council about how those proposals met with the racial equity principles.,205,,
1429,0.97,8571.829,8577.335,The Council has been working towards trying to get all of these different pieces that are spread across different city departments and branches of government to align.,205,,
1430,0.97,8577.335,8579.871,They want to make sure that they are rooted in equity principles.,205,,
1431,0.97,8579.871,8585.276,"If you take a look at page 11 of your memo, I have listed out the ways in which the principles can be applied to city governments.",205,,
1432,0.97,8585.276,8595.82,I will not read them all to you.,205,,
1433,0.97,8601.159,8605.196,"They are essentially about honoring racial justice organizing and they are about respecting and valuing community, communities most impacted.",205,,
1434,0.97,8605.196,8609.467,They are about making sure that the city understands its role in how it affects communities most impacted through its institutional power.,205,,
1435,0.97,8609.467,8612.27,It deals with making sure the city is accountable to itself when perpetuating harm.,205,,
1436,0.97,8612.27,8616.541,All of this has provided information.,205,,
1437,0.97,8616.541,8646.838,"It is not clear that the proposals that are coming out about all of these different community engagement process, about this $100 million equity communities initiative, about the task force that is intended to figure out where the funding goes, it is not clear that any of that has been informed by a racial justice analysis.",205,,
1438,0.97,8647.071,8656.748,It is not clear that there has been the kind of Self- examination about how the city as an institution that is perpetuating structural racism may be doing further harm to communities of color.,205,,
1439,0.97,8656.748,8658.75,"So as an example, I will take executive order 2020.",205,,
1440,0.97,8658.75,8659.55,We discussed this earlier.,205,,
1441,0.97,8659.55,8662.854,That is the piece that laid out all of the different work groups and Iet's.,205,,
1442,0.97,8662.854,8681.539,"Within that executive order itself, there are already some duplication in terms of the types of things that the different Idt's, in terms of the questions they are trying to answer.",205,,
1443,0.97,8681.539,8683.875,It deals with the engagement that would take place in community.,205,,
1444,0.97,8683.875,8697.789,There are eight and assumptions that do not take into account the need to look Foundational he at whether the things that the executive order is asking is rooted in racial equity principles.,205,,
1445,0.97,8697.789,8713.204,"In terms of looking at comprehensive analysis and what the city is already doing versus what has been proposed, there does not seem to be any consistency in the sense that for example, there is a community process to allocate the $10 million that the Council was just discussing.",205,,
1446,0.97,8713.204,8728.753,"At the same time, the $3 million that is intended to go to a research project, dealing with County equity analysis, that is going through the legislative Department.",205,,
1447,0.97,8728.753,8733.925,It is a separate pot of funding that is going through this particular process.,205,,
1448,0.97,8733.925,8743.968,"At the same time, we are cutting $1.8 million in funding in the office of civil rights that was intended to go towards research.",205,,
1449,0.97,8743.968,8753.678,"This was the same kinds of research that the executives were proposing to do through this task force and excuse me, the other community engagement issues.",205,,
1450,0.97,8753.678,8759.951,Úthere is not the consistency that we are cutting these funds for a particular reason.,205,,
1451,0.97,8759.951,8766.357,That one point zero 8 million has been supporting organizations that have been doing the work.,205,,
1452,0.97,8766.357,8777.368,"In addition, the source of the hundred million dollars is not entirely clear.",205,,
1453,0.97,8777.368,8786.544,There is the potential that it comes from the Jumpstart funding plan that is intended to go to communities of color.,205,,
1454,0.97,8786.544,8789.113,The money was intended to go toward communities at risk of displacement.,205,,
1455,0.97,8789.113,8790.548,These are communities of color.,205,,
1456,0.97,8790.548,8802.793,Those cuts are unclear about how they balance out with the $100 million that are being proposed in this year's office budget.,205,,
1457,0.97,8802.793,8813.571,I use these examples to point out the lack of comprehensive analysis.,205,,
1458,0.97,8813.571,8815.84,This deals with what the different parts of funding are doing.,205,,
1459,0.97,8815.84,8821.746,All of the community engagement that currently exists within the city and the answers that we have from the community are relevant.,205,,
1460,0.97,8821.746,8833.825,We need to look at all of those before moving forward and looking at any new community engagement that is coming from the executive proposal.,205,,
1461,0.97,8833.825,8843.0,This looks at how using this $100 million could be a source of harm for communities of color.,205,,
1462,0.97,8843.0,8847.038,The sense of urgency around Addresing these problems is a good thing.,205,,
1463,0.97,8847.038,8869.56,It is not entirely clear that the events of 2020 have led to an understanding of a Rsji lens and racial equity principal.,205,,
1464,0.97,8869.56,8874.865,This might inform how acting on the sense of urgency without a for understanding of city government process awaits structural racism could further harm communities of color.,205,,
1465,0.97,8874.865,8889.08,"And so, I note that something like the foundation of the principal about respecting and showing up for communities organizing for racial justice, that would mean learning and taking the lead from Antiracist communities.",205,,
1466,0.97,8889.08,8903.461,The city's effort is born of the work that all of these communities of color and Antiracist community organizing has been doing for all of these years.,205,,
1467,0.97,8903.461,8920.411,"And I acknowledge that it was all of the work that people have been doing outside of city government, it is all of the ways that communities have been creating safety for themselves.",205,,
1468,0.97,8920.411,8923.014,All of the work has been happening for a very long time.,205,,
1469,0.97,8923.014,8935.526,It has happened before the city decided to acknowledge that it is also causing harm and decided to take action this year.,205,,
1470,0.97,8935.526,8938.896,"And so, somebody recently used the term, the community has been talking for a very long time.",205,,
1471,0.97,8938.896,8941.732,The city government has decided to start listening and doing something about those things.,205,,
1472,0.97,8941.732,8953.244,"And so, one, it is not clear, excuse me, these efforts to engage community and to get all of these inputs are necessarily complementary, rather Duplicative.",205,,
1473,0.97,8953.244,8975.566,"I will wrap this up by saying that if we do not to racial equity analysis or a racial equity Toolkit before moving forward with all of this, we will not know whether the actions that are being taken are harmful to communities of color.",205,,
1474,0.97,8975.566,8986.977,We will continue to pit these communities against each other if we are not asking questions to disrupt the status quo.,205,,
1475,0.97,8986.977,8993.084,"And so, it is possible that at the end of a racial equity analysis, the city would choose to take the exact same actions that it is proposing right now.",205,,
1476,0.97,8993.084,9004.695,We would be informed about what it is that those actions are doing and how racial equity and power is playing a role in the decisions that the city makes.,205,,
1477,0.97,9004.695,9018.109,"Without a racial equity analysis, it is possible that we are continuing to perpetuate racism but just Cloaked in the language of Antiracism and equity.",205,,
1478,0.97,9018.109,9020.311,"So that being said, I have laid out a couple options.",205,,
1479,0.97,9020.311,9024.548,"As I mentioned, these are neither mutually exclusive or a comprehensive list of all of the things that counsel could do.",205,,
1480,0.97,9024.548,9035.326,"The first option, option a would be to provide some funding that I previously discussed.",205,,
1481,0.97,9035.326,9038.195,"It would be the 100 million, the $500,000 for the three quarter supplemental.",205,,
1482,0.97,9038.195,9039.63,It could be the $2 million that Hsd.,205,,
1483,0.97,9039.63,9050.608,"This will be until the committee has completed a racial equity Toolkit or analysis, at least, about the source of the revenue used for the hundred million dollars the process of allocation and what the community engagement is.",205,,
1484,0.97,9050.608,9059.116,Sometimes Toolkits can take a long time.,205,,
1485,0.97,9059.116,9060.284,They can be intensive processes.,205,,
1486,0.97,9060.284,9075.733,"At the same time, because we have been talking so much in 2020 about the racial equity outcomes and the ways in which the city as a governmental institutions Perpetuates racial equity, excuse me, racism, not racial equity.",205,,
1487,0.97,9075.733,9084.275,It is possible that this analysis has already been done and it has not been shared.,205,,
1488,0.97,9084.275,9088.179,"Option B would be to not allocate the funding for the $100 million, the 500,000, or the $2 million.",205,,
1489,0.97,9088.179,9090.681,It would deal with Re- appropriate them in a way that reflects priorities.,205,,
1490,0.97,9090.681,9108.899,Option C would be to restore the $1.08 million that was cut in the 2021 proposed budget back to the office for civil rights in order to support community organizations that are looking at alternatives to the criminal legal system.,205,,
1491,0.97,9108.899,9111.569,Option D would be to restore $30 million from the strategic investment funds.,205,,
1492,0.97,9111.569,9113.003,That is also cut in this budget.,205,,
1493,0.97,9113.003,9115.739,Option D would be to propose the major's Buzz it as laid out.,205,,
1494,0.97,9115.739,9117.808,This would be for 2021.,205,,
1495,0.97,9117.808,9128.285,That is it for the options.,205,,
1496,0.97,9129.487,9130.721,Do Council members have any questions?,205,,
1497,0.97,9130.721,9131.822,I am happy to address them.,205,,
1498,0.97,9131.822,9133.023,Thank you very much.,206,,
1499,0.97,9133.023,9133.691,Councilmember Lisa Herbold?,206,,
1500,0.97,9133.691,9134.925,Councilmember Tammy J. Morales?,206,,
1501,0.97,9135.226,9143.601,I would like to highlight my understanding.,207,,
1502,0.97,9143.601,9144.635,Correct me if I am wrong.,207,,
1503,0.97,9144.635,9176.734,We actually took the vote on the funding for Foc that are here it was to do the $1.1 million investment . I believe that we took the vote for that in 2018.,207,,
1504,0.97,9176.734,9179.37,"It was to be spent in the 2020 budget or, the year 2020.",207,,
1505,0.97,9179.37,9180.571,"And so, I just highlight that.",207,,
1506,0.97,9180.571,9183.04,My recommendation is that we voted in November for that money.,207,,
1507,0.97,9183.04,9184.041,That was a biannual budget.,207,,
1508,0.97,9184.041,9212.269,"And because we were going to do a funding process that models the, I believe it is the social equity funds process . I believe the decision was not to make the dollars available in 2019 but to hold onto them and 2020.",207,,
1509,0.97,9212.269,9212.903,That process takes longer.,207,,
1510,0.97,9212.903,9218.576,"I just, I raised this because, the community has been waiting for a long time for these dollars.",207,,
1511,0.97,9218.576,9219.81,"I just, I do not understand.",207,,
1512,0.97,9219.81,9239.096,I did not hear whether or not we received an explanation from the executive for why they are cutting these dollars after a year's worth of process engagement with community on what the priorities were for these dollars.,207,,
1513,0.97,9239.096,9246.403,Or it was a couple years worth of process engagement.,207,,
1514,0.97,9246.403,9251.041,I am completely baffled as the person who used to have this in the committee.,207,,
1515,0.97,9251.041,9266.523,I have been tracking the aft for two both identify what the priorities are and work with the community.,207,,
1516,0.97,9266.523,9275.065,I do not understand why the dollars would be cut at this juncture.,207,,
1517,0.97,9275.065,9279.737,I thought we were getting close to the point that they would be awarded at this stage.,207,,
1518,0.97,9279.737,9282.973,This is as far as options.,207,,
1519,0.97,9282.973,9303.093,"The issue we were talking about earlier, and maybe it just does not align with the concept of a lack of a Rsj I lens at duplicate in community efforts.",207,,
1520,0.97,9303.093,9310.0,May be another option could be to restore the $14 million that we were discussing earlier.,207,,
1521,0.97,9310.0,9326.183,"It was intended to be an Interfund loan to pay for crime prevention, Community-Based crime prevention programs.",207,,
1522,0.97,9328.552,9334.124,Hopefully this will replace traditional law enforcement crisis responses.,207,,
1523,0.97,9334.124,9335.793,The second question is the shorter option.,208,,
1524,0.97,9335.793,9337.294,This could be an option.,208,,
1525,0.97,9337.294,9348.739,This list does not meet the whole list of options that you as Council members have.,208,,
1526,0.97,9348.739,9350.474,"As for the first issue, you are correct.",208,,
1527,0.97,9350.474,9364.621,The Council did vote on those funds when it was a biannual budget . It was the vote for the 2019 adopted and the 2020 endorsed budget.,208,,
1528,0.97,9364.621,9365.255,That vote happened.,208,,
1529,0.97,9365.255,9369.126,"And then, when we went into discussing the 2020 proposed budget, those funds were assumed in the baseline budget.",208,,
1530,0.97,9369.126,9372.162,You have to take an additional vote to make sure that the funds were included.,208,,
1531,0.97,9372.162,9390.247,"When I talked to the executive about these funds, the collaborative process which you mentioned, that process has been ongoing.",208,,
1532,0.97,9390.247,9392.483,"The funds for 2020, they should be going out the door.",208,,
1533,0.97,9392.483,9393.884,The contract should be signed in December.,208,,
1534,0.97,9393.884,9407.898,"The reasoning for cutting the funding was because the funding took the year, the funds would be spent in 2021.",208,,
1535,0.97,9407.898,9410.1,Then they would reconsider adding funds back into the budget in 2022.,208,,
1536,0.97,9410.1,9412.369,That would be one that year's worth of funding was spent.,208,,
1537,0.97,9412.369,9417.541,I just add that is an accurate statement.,208,,
1538,0.97,9417.541,9421.512,The funds will be going out the door in December.,208,,
1539,0.97,9421.512,9435.325,"$1.08 million in ongoing funding, theoretically you could just double the amount that was going to community organizations that were doing that work.",208,,
1540,0.97,9435.325,9438.595,You could award the 2021 funds in the same way while not restarting an entire process.,208,,
1541,0.97,9438.595,9456.246,"That is not to say that that is the way to go but there is no reason why funds starting in 2021 could not just go through and be added, in the same way that for example Hsd is adding $4 million to existing contracts.",208,,
1542,0.97,9456.246,9465.756,That is a potential way.,208,,
1543,0.97,9465.756,9467.624,"Instead, they chose to cut the funding for 2021.",208,,
1544,0.97,9467.624,9469.126,"Thank you so much, I understand.",209,,
1545,0.97,9469.126,9470.36,Councilmember Tammy J.,210,,
1546,0.97,9470.36,9472.262,Morales.,210,,
1547,0.97,9472.262,9473.23,Thank you.,211,,
1548,0.97,9473.23,9487.177,I would like to first begin by thanking my colleagues.,211,,
1549,0.97,9489.012,9490.38,Thank you for the entire memo.,211,,
1550,0.97,9490.38,9493.984,I think it is really important for understanding the deep frustration that we have been hearing from community members.,211,,
1551,0.97,9493.984,9509.233,"I will say personally that I literally wept after reading section 3. you know, I recommend that the viewing audience find this memo on the Website.",211,,
1552,0.97,9509.233,9509.5,Read it.,211,,
1553,0.97,9509.5,9529.219,"I think it is really important to understand the complete Disconnect between all of the things that the community has been asking, not just for funding but recognition, acknowledgment, and an understanding of power that this institution wields.",211,,
1554,0.97,9529.219,9534.825,And there are decisions that we make about how to wield it and for whose benefit.,211,,
1555,0.97,9534.825,9544.801,So I am really thankful that we have this very nicely laid out proposal.,211,,
1556,0.97,9544.801,9545.602,Thank you very much.,211,,
1557,0.97,9545.602,9555.946,My hope is that all branches of city government will do the work of digging deeper in order to understand the difference between diversity and Antiracism.,211,,
1558,0.97,9555.946,9563.453,This is so that we can stop using our institutional power to deny responsibility for the impacts of our decisions.,211,,
1559,0.97,9563.453,9568.158,I am looking forward to having the conversation with my colleagues about which of these options we will choose.,211,,
1560,0.97,9568.158,9608.332,"As the person who is trying to get this letter Cr money out the door, trying to get Participatory budgeting in place, trying to make sure that we are investing in community in a way that centers their brilliance and ideas and their solutions, I really want to thank central staff for bringing into relief just how much of a Disconnect there is and how critical it is that we fix it.",211,,
1561,0.97,9612.469,9614.271,Thank you very much Councilmember Tammy J. Morales.,212,,
1562,0.97,9614.271,9615.739,I am not seeing any additional hands.,212,,
1563,0.97,9615.739,9618.575,I would like to echo my colleague's comments on this entire presentation thus far.,212,,
1564,0.97,9618.575,9620.711,I really appreciate the summary that is here.,212,,
1565,0.97,9620.711,9633.79,"It deals with issue number three, thank you very much for walking us through this.",212,,
1566,0.97,9633.79,9638.295,I would like to make sure for the viewing public that we remind folks that we are in the middle of deliberations.,212,,
1567,0.97,9638.295,9640.897,"The executive, the Mayor's office has proposed a budget to the city counsel.",212,,
1568,0.97,9640.897,9654.144,I do not want to Conflate the term city with what has been proposed.,212,,
1569,0.97,9656.413,9660.717,It is important for us to remember that the proposal from the Mayor's office is now up for the city council's deliberation.,212,,
1570,0.97,9660.717,9663.186,"Ultimately, what does past and gets signed will be pertinent for conversations.",212,,
1571,0.97,9663.186,9664.287,"Hopefully, that will get implemented.",212,,
1572,0.97,9664.287,9665.656,That is a reflection of the city.,212,,
1573,0.97,9665.656,9671.662,I want to make sure that we are continuing to distinguish routine where we are at in the conversation and the documents that are in front of us.,212,,
1574,0.97,9671.662,9678.869,"With that, I would like to summarize something that you said at the very end and I want to make sure that I ask a question dealing with the data and the analysis.",212,,
1575,0.97,9678.869,9680.671,It deals with what your memo calls for.,212,,
1576,0.97,9680.671,9684.775,The central staff has identified it through the years of research and investment that we as a city have invested in.,212,,
1577,0.97,9684.775,9689.446,"It deals with the concern that we are not listening to and ignoring and Duplicating, this is if we go down certain paths.",212,,
1578,0.97,9689.446,9690.247,This is my comment.,212,,
1579,0.97,9690.247,9692.115,Feel free to fill in the deep tales.,212,,
1580,0.97,9692.115,9717.674,"The bottom of page 12 says that although understanding of the city's institutional power and Footprint in local communities most impacted by structural racism and how her power plays in the context of racial equity would also lead, I am sorry, and how power plays out in the context of racial equity, this would lead the city to honor the work that has already been done.",212,,
1581,0.97,9717.674,9723.513,It deals with how to avoid Duplicating efforts that are under way.,212,,
1582,0.97,9723.513,9725.982,This is rather than characterizing them as complementary to each other.,212,,
1583,0.97,9725.982,9736.993,It would stop Overburdening communities of color.,212,,
1584,0.97,9740.497,9742.833,Comprehensive analysis with these efforts deals with a racial equity lines.,212,,
1585,0.97,9742.833,9753.009,"The Mayor's proposed budget risks perpetuating racism, repeating problems of devaluing community, Pitting communities of color against each other, and going to learn from communities.",212,,
1586,0.97,9753.009,9754.411,This has been provided to the city.,212,,
1587,0.97,9754.411,9777.167,"After such an analysis is completed, the city could take the same actions but without a racial equity analysis, it is not clear whether those actions are in alignment with racial equities principles or whether the proposed budget is continuing to perpetuate racism, Cloaked in the language of equity.",212,,
1588,0.97,9781.705,9791.515,"With that, let me just ask you, have we received any indication of whether Socr, the office of civil rights was able to provide an analysis on the creation of the task force or the work groups as I think we all would have hoped that they have?",212,,
1589,0.97,9791.515,9792.582,I have asked that question.,213,,
1590,0.97,9792.582,9798.088,I requested that we get an analysis from the team regarding what each of these would be or what the analysis would be of each of these.,213,,
1591,0.97,9798.088,9803.66,I have not yet received the response through the Sharepoint process.,213,,
1592,0.97,9803.66,9809.666,I have not received the analysis through that response.,213,,
1593,0.97,9809.666,9811.501,It is possible that it has already been done.,213,,
1594,0.97,9811.501,9817.174,It is possible that the team was not consulted.,213,,
1595,0.97,9817.174,9822.279,All of those things are possible.,213,,
1596,0.97,9822.279,9834.925,I have not received information through that Sharepoint back and forth of Rsji's analysis.,213,,
1597,0.97,9838.995,9845.235,"We do not even know if the Rsji team has been able to conduct an analysis on the various task force or Workgroup summarized on page, what was it?",214,,
1598,0.97,9845.235,9848.405,It was page 3 of them at all.,214,,
1599,0.97,9848.405,9852.542,Yes.,215,,
1600,0.97,9852.542,9857.214,"I'm sorry, it is page 7 of the memo.",216,,
1601,0.97,9857.214,9879.669,"From just being generally involved in the wider structure around Rsji and more than just the Rsji team that is in OCR, my guess would be that there has been some analysis.",217,,
1602,0.97,9879.669,9892.549,"Whether that has been, whether that has been used by the executive in informing their proposals, I am not clear.",217,,
1603,0.97,9892.549,9904.594,I have not been provided the analysis itself.,217,,
1604,0.97,9913.737,9915.505,It has not been given through the Sharepoint site.,217,,
1605,0.97,9915.505,9925.682,"Thank you for summarizing this issue and for helping us to remember that there are strategies to get that type of information already baked into the internal process, let alone making sure that we do not Exhort the external advice that we have received from expert communities as well.",218,,
1606,0.97,9925.682,9926.082,Go ahead.,218,,
1607,0.97,9926.082,9927.917,I meant to mention one more thing.,219,,
1608,0.97,9927.917,9942.832,One of the things that has come up in previous years and something that we are currently working on was the peace around whether Rsji and the office in general is able to provide the kind of analysis that the Council would be interested in while under the Purview of the executive.,219,,
1609,0.97,9942.832,9958.148,"We have been having these conversations about what independence might potentially look like . The reason for that, and this is quoted in the memo.",219,,
1610,0.97,9958.148,9961.351,The work is essentially speaking truth to power as it were.,219,,
1611,0.97,9961.351,9990.246,"If there are actions that are being taken that are not racially equitable or are just status quo and the government tends to perpetuate structural racism, and racial equity analysis, I am so sorry.",219,,
1612,0.97,9990.246,9990.88,That is okay.,220,,
1613,0.97,9990.88,9992.549,This is a work from home meeting.,220,,
1614,0.97,9992.549,9993.283,We all get it.,220,,
1615,0.97,9993.283,10000.39,I am so sorry.,221,,
1616,0.97,10000.39,10001.391,We can still hear you.,221,,
1617,0.97,10001.391,10002.058,"Okay, great.",222,,
1618,0.97,10002.058,10003.059,What was I saying?,222,,
1619,0.97,10003.059,10035.325,"To the extent that there are analyses that are happening or have taken place, the dues showed that there are ways in which the actions are being taken are not racially equitable, because of the nature of the fact that accountability that the Rsji analysis is trying to get to, is the same person who holds power over the people, over the employees, let me start over.",222,,
1620,0.97,10035.325,10035.925,I am sorry.,222,,
1621,0.97,10035.925,10053.843,The person to whom Rsji is trying to create accountability is also the person that holds power over their jobs.,222,,
1622,0.97,10053.843,10057.48,"And so, there is an inherent conflict in terms of doing Antiracism work within a racist institution.",222,,
1623,0.97,10057.48,10065.622,You can be pointing out things that are racist.,222,,
1624,0.97,10065.622,10069.058,"At the same time, it is not necessarily, you cannot necessarily be open and transparent about that.",222,,
1625,0.97,10069.058,10072.529,The person you are criticizing is the person that is holding your job in their hands.,222,,
1626,0.97,10072.529,10095.885,"So, I just note that to the extent that if there has been a request for Rsji analysis, and it has not been acted on, there is not necessarily anything that employees are doing the work can do in order to get the analysis out to others.",222,,
1627,0.97,10095.885,10099.355,That is some of the reason why we have been discussing the need for potential independence.,222,,
1628,0.97,10099.355,10100.59,This is for Rsji and the office.,222,,
1629,0.97,10100.59,10101.558,I hope that was clear.,222,,
1630,0.97,10101.558,10102.192,I apologize.,222,,
1631,0.97,10102.192,10102.992,No apologies necessary.,223,,
1632,0.97,10102.992,10105.395,"Tammy J. Morales, anything to add?",223,,
1633,0.97,10105.395,10107.263,I would like to highlight this point again.,224,,
1634,0.97,10107.263,10121.077,"It is very hard to speak truth to power in the structure, the hierarchy, you know, that the city departments are in.",224,,
1635,0.97,10121.077,10142.332,This is why it is so important for us to infuse all of our city Department with this culture of racial equity and a deep understanding.,224,,
1636,0.97,10142.465,10148.505,"This is so that it is not one or two people in any departments that are pushing for these kinds of conversations to happen, it is coming from the top down.",224,,
1637,0.97,10148.505,10155.211,Everybody understands that this is a priority and this is how we do our work in the city.,224,,
1638,0.97,10155.211,10161.284,Just having one person in every Department whose job it is to go poke about why we are not paying attention to racial equity puts that person at risk.,224,,
1639,0.97,10161.284,10188.878,So I think that we really need to think carefully about how we do this work well.,224,,
1640,0.97,10188.878,10196.185,We are going to jeopardize people's professional lives and we will not really have the kind of outcomes that we are looking for for the communities that we are trying to serve with this work.,224,,
1641,0.97,10196.185,10197.053,Thank you very much.,225,,
1642,0.97,10197.053,10198.888,"As the legislative branch, we really need that information.",225,,
1643,0.97,10198.888,10208.598,"We rely on these Rsji analyses to determine not only funding priorities and policy priorities, thank you for flagging that.",225,,
1644,0.97,10208.598,10222.211,"I would like to make sure that we do not lose sight of this request, the request that you have made to make sure that we get the Rsji analysis or to get Enhancement about whether or not one is being completed; this is necessary for us to be able to answer how we would address the options listed on the memo on page 13.",225,,
1645,0.97,10222.211,10224.28,"With that, let us know how we can help if needed.",225,,
1646,0.97,10224.28,10227.116,We really appreciate you continuing to push to get that information and that analysis.,225,,
1647,0.97,10227.116,10232.589,That brings us up to the budget actions from Council members.,225,,
1648,0.97,10232.589,10233.389,We have about nine.,225,,
1649,0.97,10233.389,10234.424,We have 30 minutes left.,225,,
1650,0.97,10234.424,10236.426,That leaves us with 30 minutes for each one.,225,,
1651,0.97,10236.426,10237.227,We can get through these.,225,,
1652,0.97,10237.227,10242.732,"Colleagues, thank you for the robust discussion.",225,,
1653,0.97,10242.732,10257.246,We will continue with the Hst and Homeles services discussion this afternoon if we can get through these budget issues.,225,,
1654,0.97,10260.883,10263.853,I will turn it back over to central staff to walk us through these items.,225,,
1655,0.97,10263.853,10266.522,"As you mentioned, this proposal is sponsored by Councilmember Lisa Herbold.",226,,
1656,0.97,10266.522,10268.324,This will allow the dismissal of crimes of poverty.,226,,
1657,0.97,10268.324,10270.56,It would do so by revising the definition of duress.,226,,
1658,0.97,10270.56,10272.128,This would be a defense against prosecution.,226,,
1659,0.97,10272.128,10273.429,I turn it over to the counsel.,226,,
1660,0.97,10273.429,10274.43,Thank you so much.,227,,
1661,0.97,10274.43,10276.466,I really appreciate the opportunity to address this issue.,227,,
1662,0.97,10276.466,10303.526,"Community is asking that the Council consider this to be budget legislation . I am putting it forward in that spirit in the hopes that my colleagues agree that because of the potential impacts that it might have, legislation like this to the budget should be considered budget legislation.",227,,
1663,0.97,10303.526,10319.108,"90% of cases prosecuted by the city, in those cases, the individual charges represented by a public defender.",227,,

1665,0.97,10321.778,10324.013,"If you recall in 2015, the council passed resolution 31637.",227,,
1666,0.97,10324.013,10327.25,This created the Seattle Reentry work group to examine how the city could assist formerly incarcerated people.,227,,
1667,0.97,10327.25,10328.584,It helps them reenter their communities.,227,,
1668,0.97,10328.584,10338.361,"The work crew's final report found that poverty, institutionalized racism and systemic oppression are root causes that lead to mass Incarceration.",227,,
1669,0.97,10338.361,10345.334,They found that punishment and Incarceration are harmful.,227,,
1670,0.97,10345.334,10357.513,"They are ineffective tools to address behaviors, triggered by poverty and illness.",227,,
1671,0.97,10358.781,10363.486,"The work group recommended that the city move away from the criminal legal system to address behaviors related to poverty, illness, and oppression.",227,,

1674,0.97,10370.159,10378.634,We recommend that responses are developed who are not burdened with criminal history or the trauma of Incarceration.,227,,
1675,0.97,10378.634,10396.686,The link to the budget process is really found in the negotiations that will be going on over the next several months into next year.,227,,
1676,0.97,10396.686,10397.887,This is around GEL usage.,227,,

1685,0.97,10447.103,10447.503,Correct.,230,,

1691,0.97,10476.566,10482.238,The report should include a forecast of the number of priority qualifying referrals and estimates of the funding necessary to support these services citywide from 2021 until 2023.,231,,

1696,0.97,10501.591,10506.796,We passed it in November 2019.,233,,

1699,0.97,10521.477,10525.081,This reduces Recidivism and it provides for public safety.,233,,
1700,0.97,10525.081,10541.531,In the resolution we declared our commitment to ensuring that law in Sherman program such as lead receive public funding sufficient to accept all priority qualifying referrals citywide.,233,,
1701,0.97,10541.531,10550.439,We expressed an intent that lead operate at scale by 2023.,233,,
1702,0.97,10550.439,10570.359,Scale would be understood to mean that the program would have appropriate funding to accept all priority qualifying arrest and social contact referrals citywide . This is intended to ensure that Posit decisions in the future are guided by well supported projections as counsel works on taking lead to scale over the next several years.,233,,
1703,0.97,10570.359,10577.333,We know that lead has built and activated community referral channels.,233,,
1704,0.97,10577.333,10586.175,Community members can directly request responses to chronic love violations that could but do not need to be responded to through an enforcement lens.,233,,
1705,0.97,10586.175,10595.584,Most people in Seattle support public responses related to behavioral health and extreme poverty.,233,,
1706,0.97,10595.584,10623.179,"Given that we are spending so much time talking about investing in these types of programs, we cannot lose sight of the lead program and the commitment we have made to bring this program that has been grown in our own backyard and has now been Replicated throughout the country.",233,,

1709,0.97,10645.935,10649.505,I think it is also a good reminder that this is not a homelessness services response program.,234,,

1770,0.97,11014.603,11017.74,We are very much looking forward to sustaining this partnership and getting these resources out.,240,,
1771,0.97,11017.74,11021.31,We hope that this is an ad that we can't support.,240,,
1772,0.97,11021.31,11032.955,"Thank you, are there any questions on number four?",241,,
1773,0.97,11041.697,11043.832,"I am not seeing any questions right now, thank you.",242,,
1774,0.97,11043.832,11046.101,"Let's go to the next one, it is number five.",243,,
1775,0.97,11046.101,11061.25,"The fifth proposal would add $50,000 in order to increase funding for a Reentry program led by a native led organization.",244,,
1776,0.97,11061.25,11063.218,Currently this program is funded through the indigenous community Rfp.,244,,
1777,0.97,11063.218,11065.621,This was awarded to two organizations and 2020 for organizations in 2022.,244,,
1778,0.97,11065.621,11067.089,The proposal is sponsored by the Councilmember.,244,,
1779,0.97,11067.089,11067.489,Councilmember?,244,,
1780,0.97,11067.489,11073.529,"Thank you, this is a really critical investment, one of the things that we do terribly in the criminal system is Reentry.",245,,
1781,0.97,11073.529,11091.58,This service and particularly through chief Seattle can be game changing they are emphasizing community wellness and they are setting folks up for success.,245,,
1782,0.97,11091.58,11099.688,"Definitely, I am looking forward to talking more about this as we go through the budget process.",245,,
1783,0.97,11099.688,11106.728,"Okay, thank you Councilmember, any questions on this item? I am not seeing any, thank you very much.",246,,
1784,0.97,11106.728,11113.502,Let's go on.,246,,
1785,0.97,11113.502,11116.205,Item 6 would add funding to the fire Department for a nurse.,247,,
1786,0.97,11116.205,11125.113,This is also proposed by Councilmember Lewis.,247,,
1787,0.97,11125.113,11125.914,Thank you Madam chair.,248,,
1788,0.97,11125.914,11126.715,Thank you central staff.,248,,
1789,0.97,11126.715,11128.35,"So, this is a little bit different.",248,,
1790,0.97,11128.35,11137.526,There is going to be some conversation later about adding a nursing component to the help in one program.,248,,
1791,0.97,11137.526,11138.727,This is a little bit different.,248,,
1792,0.97,11138.727,11140.028,"Well, this is actually very different.",248,,
1793,0.97,11140.028,11157.412,This is a proposal that I have been discussing to add a consulting to the 911 dispatch for the fire Department.,248,,
1794,0.97,11157.412,11160.449,They could work to potentially resolve certain calls that are related to the fire Department.,248,,
1795,0.97,11160.449,11163.051,This would be done over the phone with a consulting or service.,248,,
1796,0.97,11163.051,11165.12,This is a service that I am familiar with antic totally.,248,,
1797,0.97,11165.12,11175.664,My mom was working with a nurse growing up . She served as a consulting nurse.,248,,
1798,0.97,11175.664,11189.077,I do understand the benefit to being able to potentially resolve something by consulting with a nurse at dispatch rather than us having to send and Emt team or something to someone's House when simply talking to a potential over the phone.,248,,
1799,0.97,11189.077,11198.453,This could resolve the issue through some kind of other resolution.,248,,
1800,0.97,11198.453,11203.091,This is something that is a priority for the fire Department from talking to the chief about it.,248,,
1801,0.97,11203.091,11216.104,This is something they are readily capable to absorb and integrate into their dispatch.,248,,
1802,0.97,11219.841,11225.013,This could have a massive impact on reserving when we do or do not have to deploy critical first response resources out in the field.,248,,
1803,0.97,11225.013,11227.216,"Thank you, just walk me through the process.",249,,
1804,0.97,11227.216,11232.588,This might be a question for you.,249,,
1805,0.97,11232.588,11233.188,Somebody called 911.,249,,
1806,0.97,11233.188,11234.99,They flag that this is a medical related issue.,249,,
1807,0.97,11234.99,11241.73,That gets them transferred or a warm hand off two fire fighters side of 911's dispatch.,249,,
1808,0.97,11241.73,11248.403,Is that correct?,249,,
1809,0.97,11248.403,11251.64,"The Mac yes, so my understanding and central staff could jump in on this.",249,,
1810,0.97,11251.64,11269.558,"Everything initially goes to the dispatch center that is Department . der the police is something is flagged as like you know, my husband is having a heart attack.",249,,
1811,0.97,11269.558,11270.759,That will get sent to fire.,249,,
1812,0.97,11270.759,11272.361,"You know, that is something Firewood responds to.",249,,
1813,0.97,11272.361,11279.835,And then fire has a separate dispatch that is staffed by firefighters.,249,,
1814,0.97,11279.835,11286.775,"It is not just the civilian Dispatchers in 911, it is brought by rank and file firefighters.",249,,
1815,0.97,11286.775,11314.503,"This nurse would be with those firefighters at the dispatch so that when a gets to the firefighters and if it is something like Oh my God, I have got a carrot stuck up my nose, I am worried that I will not be able to breathe out of my nose.",249,,
1816,0.97,11314.503,11316.872,"The fire fighter we go Oh well, maybe talk to our nurse.",249,,
1817,0.97,11316.872,11321.309,"The nurse could be like Okay, can you just grab that carrot firmly with both hands and pull it out of there?",249,,
1818,0.97,11321.309,11323.178,"All right, we are good, we can clear this.",249,,
1819,0.97,11323.178,11324.212,I am not a professional.,249,,
1820,0.97,11324.212,11324.98,I do not know.,249,,
1821,0.97,11324.98,11328.817,It would be to basically resolve things like that.,249,,
1822,0.97,11328.817,11335.791,He would not have to send and Emt to actually go in and engage in a call that is at that extreme low Acuity.,249,,
1823,0.97,11335.791,11337.592,My understanding is that they will be right there.,249,,
1824,0.97,11337.592,11349.037,"It might be a case, talking to the chief, the consulting nurse might be based at a Partnering hospital.",249,,
1825,0.97,11349.037,11359.948,May be the call would be transferred from the fire Dispatchers to that nurse and then maybe it would come back if that nurse was actually like we need to send a person.,249,,
1826,0.97,11359.948,11363.752,Those would be questions for central staff and the fire Department as we move further.,249,,
1827,0.97,11363.752,11386.241,"You know, the goal is to basically make sure that they can reduce even further the strain on folks that have to go out in the field on a really regular basis, they have to respond to calls that could be resolved from talking to a professional and talking through it.",249,,
1828,0.97,11386.241,11387.943,That is kind of where this fits in.,249,,
1829,0.97,11387.943,11399.421,"Excellent, thank you for the summary and the example.",250,,
1830,0.97,11411.767,11413.969,I think that this is a really important piece as well.,250,,
1831,0.97,11413.969,11419.474,"This is given that many of the models that we are talking about, whether it is health one or community driven models, they are already in existence.",250,,
1832,0.97,11419.474,11422.277,Many of those are organizations and entities that are not operating 24 seven.,250,,
1833,0.97,11422.277,11428.016,"With health in one, we did hear that their 40 hour a week model that they currently have, even with additional staffing, they will not be a 24/7 entity.",250,,
1834,0.97,11428.016,11432.02,Having someone who is enter the calls as a consulting nurse or a nurse triage line is very much needed.,250,,
1835,0.97,11432.02,11438.393,"This is so that when people call 911, they can have some of those acute needs met when they are on the telephone versus when they are having somebody deployed.",250,,
1836,0.97,11438.393,11451.373,"We are very excited that you put this in, thank you for flagging it.",250,,
1837,0.97,11454.409,11456.044,Does anybody else have any questions on this?,250,,
1838,0.97,11456.044,11459.247,"Okay, let's go ahead, we have two more that are in a very similar vein.",250,,
1839,0.97,11459.247,11460.449,I will turn it over to Carlos.,250,,
1840,0.97,11460.449,11461.116,Thank you.,251,,
1841,0.97,11461.116,11462.918,"So, the next two concerning expanding health in one.",251,,
1842,0.97,11462.918,11468.557,"The first proposal, I am sorry, excuse me, I am sorry about that.",251,,
1843,0.97,11468.557,11474.262,The first proposal is sponsored by Councilmember Lewis.,251,,
1844,0.97,11474.262,11483.238,"And, this proposal would expand health in one beyond what was proposed in the 2021 budget.",251,,
1845,0.97,11483.238,11491.746,It would take the team from one they currently exist to three teams in 2021.,251,,
1846,0.97,11491.746,11492.781,"Excellent, Councilmember Lewis.",252,,
1847,0.97,11492.781,11495.984,Thank you Madam chair.,253,,
1848,0.97,11495.984,11522.811,This form letter a was written before I went and did my right along with health in one . It would probably be more similar in structure to Madam chair's form letter A. I had the privilege of doing that ride along for writing it.,253,,
1849,0.97,11522.811,11527.582,"So, I feel like this could be a fairly collaborative effort Madam chair with your form letter A. it could be merged in.",253,,
1850,0.97,11527.582,11533.188,I would still be interested in seeing if they could add a third team.,253,,
1851,0.97,11533.188,11535.624,I want to have more discussions with the fire Department about this.,253,,
1852,0.97,11535.624,11548.27,"It just seems in my discussions about the physical area, Programmatically, they want to expand.",253,,
1853,0.97,11548.27,11550.238,I have heard a lot of different versions of this.,253,,
1854,0.97,11550.238,11553.308,"They are saying Oh, Yeah, with the second vehicle, we are going to expand service.",253,,
1855,0.97,11553.308,11566.087,I also here that they will go to the end of the valley and West Seattle.,253,,
1856,0.97,11566.087,11567.923,"At that point, that is most of the city.",253,,
1857,0.97,11567.923,11571.96,"I do not know if with two vehicles, I do not know if that is going to be interesting.",253,,
1858,0.97,11571.96,11576.264,Maybe one vehicle could be based in the ship Canal or in West Seattle.,253,,
1859,0.97,11576.264,11578.466,I do not know if they will cover the service area.,253,,
1860,0.97,11578.466,11581.77,I am not a first response deployment expert.,253,,
1861,0.97,11581.77,11583.171,I could be totally wrong about that.,253,,
1862,0.97,11583.171,11602.857,"It seems like the ultimate goal is to have five vehicles spread across the five companies, it would be nice to see if we could go to at least three teams in the 2021 budget.",253,,
1863,0.97,11602.857,11605.06,This is if there is the Scalability to accommodate that.,253,,
1864,0.97,11605.06,11606.161,"Excellent, thank you Councilmember Lewis.",254,,
1865,0.97,11606.161,11607.829,I am going to ask Carlos to summarize.,254,,
1866,0.97,11607.829,11613.268,"Number eight, I do think that there is a lot of synergy there.",254,,
1867,0.97,11613.268,11619.908,"After we summarize this, I will talk about the vehicles.",254,,
1868,0.97,11619.908,11621.643,Thank you Madam chair.,255,,
1869,0.97,11621.643,11626.014,The eighth proposal is sponsored by you.,255,,
1870,0.97,11626.014,11631.92,It would at four firefighters with two Emts starting in July 2021.,255,,
1871,0.97,11631.92,11639.027,It would transfer three social workers with case management to the Seattle fire Department.,255,,
1872,0.97,11639.027,11642.897,It would add two case manager starting in July 2021 providing administrative support.,255,,
1873,0.97,11642.897,11650.805,It would require additional people.,255,,
1874,0.97,11650.805,11651.206,Great.,256,,
1875,0.97,11651.206,11675.363,"So, in addition to that, I think what we had written in was that we wanted to make sure that the fleet, I am not sure what the technical term is.",256,,
1876,0.97,11675.363,11677.632,It is the freezing of the fleet or the fleet reduction.,256,,
1877,0.97,11677.632,11679.467,It was not applied to the Seattle fire Department.,256,,
1878,0.97,11679.467,11683.271,It would allow for firefighters including health in one to be able to Repurpose some of those vehicles.,256,,
1879,0.97,11683.271,11687.208,"To address the concern that Councilmember Lewis just brought up, this would include the addition of one extra vehicle.",256,,
1880,0.97,11687.208,11688.777,"This could be acquired through, what is it called?",256,,
1881,0.97,11688.777,11690.578,It is an allowance of using a surplus feet.,256,,
1882,0.97,11690.578,11699.554,It could be used to Repurpose vehicles.,256,,
1883,0.97,11699.554,11730.285,"I think the only other difference between this item letter a and item number seven is that we were talking about phasing in the additional team in July 2021, per the conversation that we had with health in one about what was more likely to be a Scalable and achievable implementation.",256,,
1884,0.97,11730.285,11732.22,"So, it would have a slightly smaller price tag.",256,,
1885,0.97,11732.22,11733.088,It would include the fleet.,256,,
1886,0.97,11733.088,11734.689,"I am sorry, it would include the cars.",256,,
1887,0.97,11734.689,11738.993,We would love to work with you Councilmember Lewis on how we can converge these two ideas as we move forward.,256,,
1888,0.97,11738.993,11740.195,Questions on number seven or eight?,256,,
1889,0.97,11740.195,11740.795,"Okay, thank you.",256,,
1890,0.97,11740.795,11742.43,"And, number nine, this is the last one.",256,,
1891,0.97,11742.43,11752.941,It deals with central staff.,256,,
1892,0.97,11758.513,11759.047,Take it away.,256,,
1893,0.97,11759.047,11760.048,"Okay, there you are.",256,,
1894,0.97,11760.048,11764.152,So this last proposal is for legislation that would allow the city to establish an elected community's oversight board.,257,,
1895,0.97,11764.152,11765.653,There would be issues regarding police accountability.,257,,
1896,0.97,11765.653,11768.69,"Excuse me, it would include the power to investigate reports of excessive force and bias policing.",257,,
1897,0.97,11768.69,11770.325,It would deal with firing or disciplining officers.,257,,
1898,0.97,11770.325,11775.33,It is sponsored by Councilmember Kshama Sawant.,257,,
1899,0.97,11775.33,11776.931,"Councilmember Kshama Sawant, go ahead.",258,,
1900,0.97,11776.931,11777.866,Thank you.,259,,
1901,0.97,11777.866,11795.416,"So just to redirect the summary, this proposal would the request of the city's attorney office.",259,,
1902,0.97,11795.416,11802.39,It would prepare draft legislation to enable the city to establish an elected community oversight board with full powers for police accountability including the Poer to investigate excessive force and racially bias policing.,259,,
1903,0.97,11802.39,11806.795,With deal with disciplining officers.,259,,
1904,0.97,11806.795,11809.764,"The draft should include any necessary counsel bill, voter referendum or amendment.",259,,
1905,0.97,11809.764,11821.009,It would deal with the process that might be necessary.,259,,
1906,0.97,11821.009,11824.379,I do not think anybody can honestly claim that the Seattle police accountability structure is working.,259,,
1907,0.97,11824.379,11826.514,We can see that the police are not being held accountable.,259,,
1908,0.97,11826.514,11830.818,Was the police officer who Maced a Seven-Year-Old child in the face during the justice for George Floyd protest disciplined?,259,,
1909,0.97,11830.818,11830.985,No.,259,,
1910,0.97,11830.985,11845.2,Have any police officers involved in killing eight people just since the Mayor came into office faced any discipline?,259,,
1911,0.97,11845.2,11845.366,No.,259,,
1912,0.97,11845.366,11858.546,We are told that the office of police accountability and the inspector general are independent oversight bodies.,259,,
1913,0.97,11860.715,11862.45,This is because they are not led by sworn officers.,259,,
1914,0.97,11862.45,11865.92,The reality is that they are extensively tied to the structures of the Seattle police Department.,259,,
1915,0.97,11865.92,11869.757,"Even if that were not true, they are not independent of the Mayor and the political establishment of the city.",259,,
1916,0.97,11869.757,11873.261,We need an oversight board that is elected and empowered democratically to hold the police accountable.,259,,
1917,0.97,11873.261,11878.032,"They need to be in power to have full oversight for the police to investigate, subpoena, to discipline and fire if necessary.",259,,
1918,0.97,11878.032,11896.384,Being in elected board for the explicit purpose and mandate of bringing about police accountability will mean that they are going to be answerable themselves to voters.,259,,
1919,0.97,11896.384,11897.785,They themselves will be under pressure.,259,,
1920,0.97,11897.785,11900.855,I understand that such a meaningful overhaul would acquire several legal steps to come into effect.,259,,
1921,0.97,11900.855,11902.09,We may even need an amendment.,259,,
1922,0.97,11902.09,11906.694,This statement of legislative intent to request the office to repair the part way to implement genuine community oversight of the police.,259,,
1923,0.97,11906.694,11908.162,I urge Councilmembers to support it.,259,,
1924,0.97,11908.162,11917.505,"This whole morning has been an extensive discussion by Councilmembers, expressing their frustration about various aspects that are not working.",259,,
1925,0.97,11917.505,11920.341,I think that this is not going to be the solution for everything.,259,,
1926,0.97,11920.341,11925.38,This is going to be a key part of addressing the broken structure that we have right now.,259,,
1927,0.97,11925.38,11940.161,I wanted to add that my office and the movement is hardly the only section of the society nationwide that is having the discussion.,259,,
1928,0.97,11940.161,11946.334,"First of all, I mentioned that this demand came about as a course of the black lives matter movement.",259,,
1929,0.97,11946.334,11947.502,This has been over several years.,259,,
1930,0.97,11947.502,11950.204,It especially got amplified in the justice for George Floyd protest over the summer.,259,,
1931,0.97,11950.204,11962.05,There have been various polls done nationwide.,259,,
1932,0.97,11976.331,11979.5,In one of the polls that was conducted in July was by the Pew research center.,259,,
1933,0.97,11979.5,11982.57,"Three quarters nationwide, and this includes the majority of Republicans, 58% of Republicans supported this.",259,,
1934,0.97,11982.57,11988.209,"This is not exactly what we are talking about but basically, this is an idea of oversight having actual power to investigate and discipline officers accused of misconduct.",259,,
1935,0.97,11988.209,11989.877,That is how the question was phrased.,259,,
1936,0.97,11989.877,11992.48,"A majority of Democrats, 89%, and as I said, 58% of Republicans supported it.",259,,
1937,0.97,11992.48,11996.651,"More urgently, San Diego has a voter initiative that is going to be on the ballot for November.",259,,
1938,0.97,11996.651,12002.59,The history is that the activists wanted a stronger community review board for the police Department in 2016.,259,,
1939,0.97,12002.59,12004.158,They did not get it.,259,,
1940,0.97,12004.158,12019.073,They got something called measure G. this was voted on at that time.,259,,
1941,0.97,12019.073,12019.874,It made minimal changes.,259,,
1942,0.97,12019.874,12022.41,There was a demand to have some meaningful shifts again in 2018.,259,,
1943,0.97,12022.41,12024.245,The city council did not act at that time.,259,,
1944,0.97,12024.245,12034.889,"In 2020, San Diego voters have a measure B. this is asking and creating a Commission on police practices.",259,,
1945,0.97,12034.889,12036.19,They do not say this is elected.,259,,
1946,0.97,12036.19,12038.76,I think an elected board is a fundamental component of making this work.,259,,
1947,0.97,12038.76,12057.245,"What is good about measure B is that it says that such a Commission will be able to appoint their own staff, their own independent attorney and most importantly, they will have the power to subpoena and conduct investigations into police officer misconduct.",259,,
1948,0.97,12057.245,12064.752,"It would also have the power to review complaints against officers and investigate in custody deaths, shootings by police, and other allegations of misconduct.",259,,
1949,0.97,12064.752,12068.623,"Also, in Portland, there is a measure 26 2017.",259,,
1950,0.97,12068.623,12080.234,There is a manager on the ballot.,259,,
1951,0.97,12088.609,12095.483,"This would amend the city's charter to establish a new oversight board, giving the bore the power to subpoena witnesses and request police documents and evidence to investigate complaints made against the Portland police Bureau.",259,,
1952,0.97,12095.483,12098.753,This would allow the board to impose disciplinary actions up to termination of Law- enforcement professionals.,259,,
1953,0.97,12098.753,12102.356,It would authorize the board to put forward policing policies.,259,,
1954,0.97,12102.356,12105.193,These are both very strong measures that are being put forward to the voters.,259,,
1955,0.97,12105.193,12112.967,"In addition to this, in Chicago, this very month, the strongest measures have come forward.",259,,
1956,0.97,12112.967,12113.901,This is not a ballot measure.,259,,
1957,0.97,12113.901,12116.838,This has come from the board of alderman or the city council in Chicago.,259,,
1958,0.97,12116.838,12128.316,"At this moment, 30 other men are supporting, I think about 50 or so, 30 alderman are supporting a measure that has and put forward by alderman.",259,,
1959,0.97,12128.316,12142.296,This has been a combination of discussions in the coalition of community organizations.,259,,
1960,0.97,12142.296,12144.065,This has been under the umbrella of grassroots accountability.,259,,
1961,0.97,12144.065,12145.366,This is a substantial police of legislation.,259,,
1962,0.97,12145.366,12157.411,This would create an elected community control board over the police and Productively the Democratic Mayor is not supporting this.,259,,
1963,0.97,12157.411,12159.647,It has a really strong support among the alderman in Chicago.,259,,
1964,0.97,12159.647,12163.084,This shows Seattle is not the only one city that is going to be having this discussion.,259,,
1965,0.97,12163.084,12178.733,"In light of all the urgency that has been created by the movement, in light of all of the statements that have been made, I would really hope that Councilmembers support this and actually in the near future, they create an oversight board.",259,,
1966,0.97,12178.733,12181.769,Thank you.,260,,
1967,0.97,12181.769,12187.642,Are there any questions here?,260,,
1968,0.97,12187.642,12190.811,"Okay, I did hear you say it is a statement of legislative intent, correct?",260,,
1969,0.97,12190.811,12195.783,"It is, it is,",261,,
1970,0.97,12195.783,12201.489,"It is Okay, I can follow up with you afterwards.",262,,
1971,0.97,12201.489,12204.091,"Yes, this is a statement of legislative intent.",263,,
1972,0.97,12204.091,12214.068,I want to be clear that this is a Daddy that needs to be conducted by the office to have the actual steps to go forward.,263,,
1973,0.97,12214.068,12226.213,It includes also for the two may a concrete recommendation as to the legal process that would be necessary.,263,,
1974,0.97,12226.213,12228.082,There should be a charter amendment or a city ordinance.,263,,
1975,0.97,12228.082,12238.459,It is very specific.,263,,
1976,0.97,12238.893,12239.827,Thank you very much.,264,,
1977,0.97,12239.827,12241.896,I am not seeing any additional questions on this item.,264,,
1978,0.97,12241.896,12243.731,That concludes us walking through the community safety memo.,264,,
1979,0.97,12243.731,12245.132,Thank you again.,264,,
1980,0.97,12245.132,12245.933,Thank you to everyone.,264,,

1988,0.97,12273.361,12274.962,We appreciate the memo on that as well.,264,,
1989,0.97,12274.962,12286.974,We do understand that there is not any Councilmember issue ideas so it could be used for follow-up conversations if we do not get to it.,264,,
1990,0.97,12286.974,12290.044,"If there is nothing else for the good of the order, the meeting is in recess.",264,,
