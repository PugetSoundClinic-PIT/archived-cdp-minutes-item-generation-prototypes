124,0.97,787.586,813.212,"I just want to emphasize that language is super important when constructing this bill, specifically that the funds be channeled directly into black lives organizations and that the Council use the word black to emphasize the significant contributions that have been made by our local black community.",25,,
125,0.97,813.212,827.593,There are a Plethora of organizations that need this funding . The current white centric Non-Community-Based services do not work for the predominantly black service population.,25,,
126,0.97,827.593,830.696,That is quoting King County equity now.,25,,
127,0.97,830.696,834.767,The Council has an opportunity to set a new precedent by channeling directly into black community.,25,,
128,0.97,834.767,842.041,Instead of indirectly channeling through predominantly white led organizations.,25,,
129,0.97,842.041,850.649,"So, changing the channels by which these funds are distributed can prevent from the repetition of the outcome of the paycheck protection program.",25,,

138,0.97,890.856,892.558,"That said, this proposal is not the answer.",27,,
139,0.97,892.558,896.495,"On the contrary, it's an affront to progressive liberal, and basic democratic beliefs.",27,,
140,0.97,896.495,903.702,It's ridiculous to imply that learning between the SPD and Israel are the cause of police violence.,27,,

250,0.97,1554.519,1563.028,"We see Palestinians there and the Adversities, restaurants, riding the same buses.",44,,
251,0.97,1563.028,1566.932,I don't even know why this is coming up in the Seattle city council.,44,,
252,0.97,1566.932,1570.669,It Singles out Israel that has endured over 4000 rockets on its civilians from Gaza.,44,,
253,0.97,1570.669,1576.841,"No mention of Hamas, which is a terrorist organization running Gaza.",44,,
254,0.97,1576.841,1581.479,It creates more anti-Semitism in the Seattle city --,44,,

339,0.97,2190.688,2207.371,"As the title States, council bill 120102 would authorize the execution of a collective bargaining agreement between the city of Seattle and the International brotherhood of electrical workers, local 77.",66,,
340,0.97,2207.371,2212.81,"This collective bargaining agreement is a two year agreement on wages, benefits, hours and other working conditions for a time from January 23rd, 2021 through January 22nd, 2023.",66,,
341,0.97,2212.81,2223.588,It affects about 565 regularly appointed city employees and its terms include a Cost-Of- living adjustment of 2.5%.,66,,
342,0.97,2223.588,2259.457,"There is also an additional one- time base wage market increase of 10% to certain job titles as listed in attachment a to the collective bargaining agreement and an increase to the Cable Splicer and electrical constructor classifications for parity with the corresponding line worker classification rate of the paper the terms of the collective bargaining agreement to meet the negotiation parameters set by the members of the labor relations polity Committee, of which five members of the city council sit on and participate in actively.",66,,
343,0.97,2259.457,2270.101,"Colleagues, after the labor relations policy committee process, I do as the chair of the labor relations policy Committee on behalf of the city Council, I do recommend that my colleagues support the passage of this legislation.",66,,
344,0.97,2270.101,2273.07,Are there any additional comments on the bill?,66,,
345,0.97,2273.07,2275.573,Council member Pedersen.,66,,
346,0.97,2275.573,2279.043,"Thank you, Council President.",67,,
347,0.97,2279.043,2284.548,Appreciate your hard work on this on the hard work of the members of the labor relations policy committee.,67,,
348,0.97,2284.548,2300.598,"I'm not one of the five Councilmembers serving on the Lrp see, which also includes the Mayor, his executive team, essentially the combined Councilmembers and Mayor's executive team represent management arm of city government.",67,,
349,0.97,2300.598,2304.635,It negotiates these labor contracts of city government employees.,67,,
350,0.97,2304.635,2314.211,"So, when this proposed project appeared last week it was the first time I was able to review it.",67,,
351,0.97,2314.211,2320.284,I would like to take this opportunity to explain my vote today to my constituents and how I'm able to get to a Yes vote on this.,67,,
352,0.97,2320.284,2326.924,"First, I want to express my gratitude to our electrical workers who dedicate themselves and their skills to our city.",67,,
353,0.97,2326.924,2337.234,"Thanks again to the hard work of the members of the Lrpc, who members of the public may not know spend hours upon hours outside the spotlight working on all of these labor contracts.",67,,
354,0.97,2337.234,2346.243,"As I understand it, this contract would increase compensation for many of the workers by 12.5%.",67,,
355,0.97,2346.243,2352.149,Which appear to be unusually high in just one year.,67,,
356,0.97,2352.149,2355.219,This is an increase of $7.5 million.,67,,
357,0.97,2355.219,2364.762,Most labor contracts with city government employees recently received an increase based on the consumer price index +1%.,67,,
358,0.97,2364.762,2374.872,Is 12.5% increase today as I understand it is comprised of the CPI of approximately 2.5 plus another one time 10%.,67,,
359,0.97,2374.872,2378.609,While the 10% is one time it does create a new baseline of Compensaton for the city employees.,67,,
360,0.97,2378.609,2386.484,"In other words, the higher costs will continue into the second year of the two can't track that's about a $15 million increase.",67,,
361,0.97,2386.484,2394.391,"While this 10% bump is significant, I had the benefit of chairing the committee that includes Seattle city light.",67,,
362,0.97,2394.391,2406.003,I have additional opportunities to witness the important work conducted by these workers who go out into the field under dangerous conditions to use the skills of their trade to benefit our city.,67,,
363,0.97,2406.003,2408.405,I understand there has been increased attrition within this group of workers.,67,,
364,0.97,2408.405,2415.913,Leaving Seattle utility light for other utility enterprises that have been offering compensation at higher levels.,67,,
365,0.97,2415.913,2431.595,This proposed increase in compensation appears to be an appropriate adjustment to reflect reality spirit this is both public's private sector utilities.,67,,
366,0.97,2431.595,2438.035,Competing against are fielded skill workers.,67,,
367,0.97,2438.035,2441.572,City light did also seems to show higher attrition rates among women and people of color.,67,,
368,0.97,2441.572,2449.847,I hope this increase in compensation can help our utility attract and retain skilled staff to meet its race and gender equity goals.,67,,
369,0.97,2449.847,2453.451,Another important consideration is how this impact might impact rates.,67,,
370,0.97,2453.451,2464.461,Utility rates are aggressive with lower income households playing a larger percentage of their household income.,67,,
371,0.97,2464.461,2470.367,"In a city where many of us are concerned about Affordability for our long-term residents, we want to be mindful when increasing costs.",67,,
372,0.97,2470.367,2484.982,"In this case, Seattle city light under the leadership of Deborah Smith has been making so much progress to control other cost drivers that the overall electricity rate increases in their strategic plan have come down.",67,,
373,0.97,2484.982,2499.43,"As we learned in our committee just two weeks ago, our electricity rate increases will average no more than 3.5%, close to the rate of inflation, rather than 4.5% increase previously suggested.",67,,
374,0.97,2499.43,2505.169,This proposed increase in pay for these highly skilled workers is already built into that 3.5% average rate increase.,67,,
375,0.97,2505.169,2513.21,"In other words, this proposed increase of compensation for these highly skilled professionals will not increase the overall electricity rates further.",67,,
376,0.97,2513.21,2519.516,"Another important consideration is that we are emerging from the pandemic, which should help with overall city revenues.",67,,
377,0.97,2519.516,2529.293,This is relevant because our general fund takes money from Seattle city light and Seattle public utilities every year with what's called a utility tax.,67,,
378,0.97,2529.293,2539.637,I'd like to see city government tax on our publicly owned utilities reduced over time to further reduce Regressive rate pressures on low income households.,67,,
379,0.97,2539.637,2541.639,I appreciate having the past week to review this contract.,67,,
380,0.97,2541.639,2548.946,"I know it's not always possible, but I look forward to an allocation even more time to review labor contracts.",67,,
381,0.97,2548.946,2550.247,Especially when we are reviewing multiple ones.,67,,
382,0.97,2550.247,2557.521,This was just one so it was manageable.,67,,
383,0.97,2557.521,2565.162,"Our current Council rules require us to vote yes or no on legislation at full Council, so more time is always welcome to make well-informed decisions.",67,,
384,0.97,2565.162,2569.066,Thank you for the space to M█Ak these lengthy comments and I will be voting yes.,67,,
385,0.97,2569.066,2571.869,"Not a problem, thank you Councilmember, Pedersen.",68,,
386,0.97,2571.869,2574.471,Appreciate you digging in and taking a closer look at that.,68,,
387,0.97,2574.471,2581.478,"Okay colleagues, any additional--any other additional comments on the bill?",68,,
388,0.97,2581.478,2585.115,"Hearing none, will the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill?",68,,
389,0.97,2606.503,2608.606,"Nine in favor, none opposed.",69,,
390,0.97,2608.606,2615.112,The bill passes and the chair will sign it.,70,,
391,0.97,2615.112,2619.516,With the clerk please affect my signature to the legislation on my behalf.,70,,
392,0.97,2619.516,2623.621,"Okay, report of the Finance and housing committee.",71,,

394,0.97,2627.424,2631.495,"A report of the Finance and housing Committee, agenda item 2. Council bill 120013.",72,,
395,0.97,2631.495,2640.204,An ordinance relating--related to the city's response to the Covid-19 crisis creating a new Fund and the city Treasury.,72,,

400,0.97,2653.817,2658.856,"Thank you very much, Madam President.",73,,
401,0.97,2658.856,2665.362,I am honored to be able to kick off a summary of this legislation that you and I have a chance to co-author together.,73,,
402,0.97,2665.362,2669.666,Along with the Mayor's office and all the Councilmembers that are here today that provided tremendous input along with community members.,73,,
403,0.97,2669.666,2677.574,I would do the best to get it kicked off and really just want to thank you I'm excited to be able to be here today as we look to pass the Seattle rescue plan.,73,,
404,0.97,2677.574,2682.179,I will note that this is the first of three acts that you can expect from us over the next few months.,73,,
405,0.97,2682.179,2691.188,"As we seek to respond to the crisis that Covid not only created, but exacerbated in many cases when you look at the inequities in our previous system that would just explode by Covid.",73,,
406,0.97,2691.188,2693.791,First of three asked to come.,73,,
407,0.97,2693.791,2701.465,"We have before us with this proposal and the Seattle rescue plan one in front of us, the first tranche of the American rescue plan act dollars.",73,,
408,0.97,2701.465,2716.113,"This represents the first tranche that the city of Seattle is receiving that will total $232 million over the course of this year and next year which means that half of that, $116 million is being passed today.",73,,
409,0.97,2716.113,2719.016,We are adding to that $12.2 million from the home investment partnership plan.,73,,
410,0.97,2719.016,2731.995,"These bills together, these investments together, represent an incredible opportunity for us to move forward on the commitments that this Council made when we first passed Council resolution 31999 back in March.",73,,
411,0.97,2731.995,2733.731,Since then we've had five subsequent meetings.,73,,
412,0.97,2733.731,2745.409,We've had a public hearing completely devoted from hearing from the public about what committee members need and where they would like these dollars Prioritized.,73,,
413,0.97,2745.409,2752.049,We've had the chance to talk to city councils from Austin to Minneapolis to Denver and so many others to hear where other progressive cities are looking to invest these dollars.,73,,
414,0.97,2752.049,2775.439,"Most importantly, we've heard directly from Community partners, from organizations, from those most impacted by Covid, and from all Councilmembers where you would like to see these dollars invested so that our city money can be coupled with State and Federal investments to truly make an impact now, and to lay the groundwork for a more equitable economy as we seek to recover and respond to Covid.",73,,
415,0.97,2775.439,2779.743,Two weeks ago we had the chance to introduce this legislation.,73,,
416,0.97,2779.743,2787.551,"Again in partnership with the Council President's office on the Mayor's office, we kept in mind all the recommendations and the priorities that each Councilmember added to the Council resolution.",73,,
417,0.97,2787.551,2801.398,"Since then, we've made sure that among--within our Finance and housing committee members, we've heard from various community members and community--committee Council participants about their priorities.",73,,
418,0.97,2801.398,2812.709,We had a chance to have discussions about where we would like to see dollars invested so we can address the most urgent needs in our community and lay that more equitable framework.,73,,
419,0.97,2812.709,2820.717,The priorities we sent to Admin spill similar to the priorities E've been talking a the Beginnig of the onset of Covid.,73,,
420,0.97,2820.717,2824.688,We included these parities when we passed the Jumpstart progressive revenue proposal back in June and July of last year.,73,,
421,0.97,2824.688,2835.532,We included them again centering our values around equity and making sure that we were putting funding directly to those most impacted in our budget last year.,73,,
422,0.97,2835.532,2842.706,"These bills in front of us today respond directly to the crises exacerbated by Covid by investing in housing, and homelessness.",73,,
423,0.97,2842.706,2846.109,Economic resiliency and small businesses.,73,,
424,0.97,2846.109,2857.955,"And to the arts and culture and directly into making sure that those who have been most disproportionately impacted, and often left out of previous Federal assistance under the Trump administration, were first to receive dollars.",73,,
425,0.97,2857.955,2873.237,"That we centered investments, not just in ensuring that those individuals were thought of, but that the organizations are work directly with those individuals and to have trust, and deep ties and roots within those communities, are receiving those dollars.",73,,
426,0.97,2873.237,2880.477,Is only a few areas that I'll highlight because I know a lot of folks are excited about highlighting various commitments they've included.,73,,
427,0.97,2880.477,2898.161,"One of the things I'm most excited about is $25 million in direct cash assistance specifically to go into the hands of working families and individuals, our Elders and folks that have been really struggling by the impacts of Covid, to make sure that we can have a direct infusion into our local economy.",73,,
428,0.97,2898.161,2905.802,Recognizing that those who are experiencing hardship know best how to use that cash assistance.,73,,
429,0.97,2905.802,2921.118,I'm most excited about the Childcare systems of $8 million combined going directly to support Childcare Spiders and $5 million of that going to create greater access to affordable Childcare throughout our city by making sure we have capital investments to build from our affordable Childcare.,73,,
430,0.97,2921.118,2937.534,"In King County and Seattle, we know that somewhere between 7 to 10% of our Childcare facilities have closed, and some looking like they are on foresight going to stay permanently closed unless we do something and act with urgency now as a city council.",73,,
431,0.97,2937.534,2948.512,"We know this is a critical investment for us to make because across our Nation and right here in the city of Seattle, if we don't invest in Childcare, it hurts our local economy, as well as hurting local families.",73,,
432,0.97,2948.512,2952.149,The closure of Childcare across our country is resulting in billions of dollars lost to employers each year.,73,,
433,0.97,2952.149,2958.822,"And over 500,000 children without Childcare in our country.",73,,
434,0.97,2958.822,2972.235,"Childcare workers have found themselves out of work during this pandemic with a net loss of around 170,000 Childcare worker positions opened between January of 2020 and January of 2021 we can do something about that right here.",73,,
435,0.97,2972.235,2983.447,Our investment of $8 million into Childcare specifically attempts to make sure that we are encouraging the creation of additional Childcare and recognizing and honoring and appreciating those Childcare providers who have helped us during this last year.,73,,
436,0.97,2983.447,2987.751,We talked about the need for this rescue plan to respond to the theme session.,73,,
437,0.97,2987.751,3012.075,"Not the recession, recognizing that women were much more likely to have left the workforce because of lack of access to Childcare and also recognizing that it has been disproportionate women and people of color who have been on the frontline more exposed to Covid if they have been able to keep their jobs as a center workers in the service sector in many cases.",73,,
438,0.97,3012.075,3029.025,"I'm really excited about the ways in which we tied in care for the trauma that people have been through in the last year by investing funding into domestic violence prevention, youth services, senior services, to care for isolation and neglect.",73,,
439,0.97,3029.025,3053.95,"I know there's much more we need to do, but I want to also see these investments paired with what the county has offered, King County is investing about $30 million specifically for behavioral health responses and recovery to help identify ways in which we can make sure that those who have been hardest hit, even before Covid, but especially those who have had their behavioral and mental health needs exacerbated during Covid, that they have the services they need.",73,,
440,0.97,3053.95,3058.822,I want to applaud King County Council and the executive on the passage of their rescue plan act just a few weeks ago.,73,,
441,0.97,3058.822,3072.636,Our proposal is going to be packaged and complement many of the areas that King County invested in and investments in Dave your health is one area where I'm excited to see the complementary funding streaming go on.,73,,
442,0.97,3072.636,3085.882,"I want to note as I'm sure Councilmember Lewis may speak to, the importance of the five--over $5 million I should say, $7.5 million if I remember from recollection, that is going in to match the King County just cares like program.",73,,
443,0.97,3085.882,3096.393,"Services like Ghesquiere that is responding directly to the need for homeless folks, those experiencing homelessness, to have access to appropriate shelter during the time of Covid.",73,,
444,0.97,3096.393,3108.171,Recognizing we are not out of the storm yet the Variants continue to show increasing concern in our area.,73,,
445,0.97,3108.171,3120.117,We want to make sure none Congregant shelter options like hotels are invested in and that we match the county's effort of around $7.5 million to bring programs like just care to scale.,73,,
446,0.97,3120.117,3129.893,"We have said it countless times about the pandemic, we know that the exacerbation of the inequities that were present before have just been made worse by Covid, but those especially Archer for the racial inequities.",73,,
447,0.97,3129.893,3136.333,We see race of communities of color who have been contracting Covid and dying from Covid.,73,,
448,0.97,3136.333,3140.003,Be Exponentially higher than white residents.,73,,
449,0.97,3140.003,3153.45,"This pattern follows many other social inequities that put racial and ethnic minorities at increased risk, and increased risk of health disparities, educational attainment disparities, wealth and income gap disparities and so much more.",73,,
450,0.97,3153.45,3163.56,That's why we have centered our investments today on making sure that we are looking at near and long-term investments for the Seattle rescue plan act through the lens of what is just.,73,,
451,0.97,3163.56,3181.878,Just for racial and ethnic commitments for making sure that folks have been disproportionately impacted have the assistance they need and that we are creating greater opportunities for economic stability and opportunity.,73,,
452,0.97,3181.878,3194.024,I'm very excited about the language that we also included that make sure that Community- based organizations are culturally relevant and historically rooted in and funded by communities that have been disproportionately impacted by Covid and have organizational leadership staff.,73,,
453,0.97,3194.024,3196.993,For the purposes of direct grants and allocations of grants to committees.,73,,
454,0.97,3196.993,3208.505,"We built this language with community partners . is not just important to talk about where the funding goes, but how the funding is allocated.",73,,
455,0.97,3208.505,3217.914,That language is intentionally written in and expanded actually as well into both this bill and the cash assistance bill that we will pass as a follow-up to this legislation.,73,,
456,0.97,3217.914,3219.015,I will stop there.,73,,
457,0.97,3219.015,3233.43,With just noting those few areas in my excitement around the $28.5 million going into housing and acquisition and building more homes.,73,,
458,0.97,3233.43,3236.9,We are really creating affordable housing and stability for folks as we seek to recover from Covid.,73,,
459,0.97,3236.9,3243.106,"I'll save the rest of my comments, Council President, for Wrap-Up at the end of this discussion.",73,,
460,0.97,3243.106,3245.809,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Mosqueda for that.",74,,
461,0.97,3245.809,3248.311,"Councilmember Lewis, I see you have your hands up.",74,,
462,0.97,3248.311,3257.52,"I'm going to call on your first colleagues, for those of you who would also like to make comments on this particular Council bill, do let me know by raising your hands.",74,,
463,0.97,3257.52,3260.056,"Councilmember Lewis, please.",74,,
464,0.97,3260.056,3262.559,"Thank you, Madam President.",75,,
465,0.97,3262.559,3271.935,I do just briefly want to lift up the really critical homelessness and public safety investments that are being made in this package today.,75,,
466,0.97,3271.935,3290.086,"All of the conversation that we had been having in this Council in regards to the just care model, my comments this morning at briefing, some of that is going to come to reality through the very real investments that we are making here.",75,,
467,0.97,3290.086,3302.966,"By joining forces with King County to do this joint procurement for a just care like approach and just care like strategy, to extend the benefits that we have seen in the Chinatown International district and Pioneer square neighborhood to neighborhoods throughout the city.",75,,
468,0.97,3302.966,3311.574,"Really start to see a very, very tangible improvement and benefit that that model brings.",75,,
469,0.97,3311.574,3315.512,I'm really looking forward to voting for this package.,75,,
470,0.97,3315.512,3339.335,"For those investments alone, let alone all the other great investments that Councilmember Mosqueda just gave an overview for, I do want to just briefly address that over the last week working with central staff, city departments and downtown Stakeholders, we were able to get a go ahead from the people we have been working with on downtown programming and reopening and support.",75,,
471,0.97,3339.335,3349.646,They will be able to achieve their programming ambitions within how this package is currently Divvied up.,75,,
472,0.97,3349.646,3361.858,"So, there was no need to bring an amendment to seek additional exclusive appropriations for downtown recovery.",75,,
473,0.97,3361.858,3365.995,"So, I did just want to address that since I had indicated that I would intentionally be bringing such an amendment.",75,,
474,0.97,3365.995,3384.848,"My understanding from talking to downtown Seattle Association, Department of economic development, and our various arts partners, is that there is enough resource that can be allocated under the current Treviso's and budget line items to accommodate the plans that are being baked in.",75,,
475,0.97,3384.848,3387.984,There is no need for any kind of additional authority in the package.,75,,
476,0.97,3387.984,3393.089,"So, I just wanted to acknowledge that.",75,,
477,0.97,3393.089,3398.261,"With that, I don't have any additional comments and I'm looking forward to voting on this today.",75,,
478,0.97,3398.261,3401.398,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Lewis for that.",76,,
479,0.97,3401.398,3402.799,"Councilmember Morales, please.",76,,
480,0.97,3402.799,3404.267,Thank you.,77,,
481,0.97,3404.267,3406.603,"Thanks so much, colleagues.",77,,
482,0.97,3406.603,3413.91,I do want to just talk about a couple of the amendments that were included in this bill.,77,,
483,0.97,3413.91,3429.626,"Our office, after lots of conversation with small business, with arts organizations, grassroots activists, and even other elected officials, worked really hard together their ideas and input on how to use this sort of once in a generation investment.",77,,
484,0.97,3429.626,3432.395,To build a more equitable economic recovery.,77,,
485,0.97,3432.395,3440.637,I'm excited to have two amendments that were developed in partnership with them included here.,77,,
486,0.97,3440.637,3449.813,The kind of conversations we were having included an acknowledgment that there just isn't enough economic opportunity for folks in the city.,77,,
487,0.97,3449.813,3463.827,"46% of the workforce in greater Seattle is either unemployed or stuck in low-wage work before Covid, and we know that problem has only gotten worse.",77,,
488,0.97,3463.827,3468.064,We know that there is also an inequitable access to opportunity in the city.,77,,
489,0.97,3468.064,3470.934,Particularly for black and Hispanic folks in our community.,77,,
490,0.97,3470.934,3482.745,And that Seattle ranks in the bottom third of large Metro areas for black and Hispanic representation in technology and in managerial roles.,77,,
491,0.97,3482.745,3487.984,"So, I'm excited that with this bill we can really begin to address some of these disparities.",77,,
492,0.97,3487.984,3498.595,"The commitment of $22 million into this bill to create good jobs, to begin developing skills that are relevant to good jobs.",77,,
493,0.97,3498.595,3500.997,Supporting friends with technical assistance.,77,,
494,0.97,3500.997,3505.101,Increasing access to wealth building strategies.,77,,
495,0.97,3505.101,3510.306,These are the kinds of investments that we need in order to really begin building an equitable recovery for folks.,77,,
496,0.97,3510.306,3518.815,The other thing I want to acknowledge is that--and I do want to thank Councilmember Lewis for your comments.,77,,
497,0.97,3518.815,3532.896,"A big, big part of the inequity that we have experienced is because our neighborhood business associations, neighborhood commercial districts, just don't have access to the kind of resources that a downtown area might be able to generate.",77,,
498,0.97,3532.896,3546.91,I do think it's important that $5.5 million of the funding will be specifically for neighborhood business organizations and associations.,77,,
499,0.97,3546.91,3554.417,"Then, the last thing I want to say is that the bill also addresses, or begins to address the challenges of our young people.",77,,
500,0.97,3554.417,3566.563,Who are trying to get the skills that they need to have a Pathway to good Union paying--Union wage jobs.,77,,
501,0.97,3566.563,3586.983,"To career paths, and especially for those who maybe taking care of family members or may not have an opportunity to go to college, I'm excited that our office has been working with the court Commission to expand the current opportunity youth initiative by adding $1 million to the existing program.",77,,
502,0.97,3586.983,3612.308,"So, as I mentioned before, an important strategy that can help lead young people into good Union jobs includes expanding Internships . This $1 million will go a long way toward expanding that program, not just for the summer, but expanding it to a year-round program that can really support our young people.",77,,
503,0.97,3612.308,3616.879,"So, I want to thank the members of the Finance and housing Committee for their support of these amendments that I offered.",77,,
504,0.97,3616.879,3623.619,Look forward to passing a bill that is really rooted in the principles of an equitable recovery.,77,,
505,0.97,3623.619,3628.324,Thank you so much Councilmember Morales for those comments.,78,,
506,0.97,3628.324,3629.792,Next up is Councilmember Herbold.,78,,
507,0.97,3629.792,3630.793,Thank you so much.,79,,
508,0.97,3630.793,3641.337,I just want to really recognize that there has just been actually some good news recently about the pandemic.,79,,
509,0.97,3641.337,3643.74,King County hitting 70% vaccination rates.,79,,
510,0.97,3643.74,3645.508,Hospitalizations and cases down.,79,,

512,0.97,3649.112,3651.247,And a statewide reopening right around the corner.,79,,
513,0.97,3651.247,3669.165,Úthe work that we have been doing here at the city Council and that the county has been doing at the county Council is really making this concept of building back better something that is--seems like a realistic thing to strive for.,79,,
514,0.97,3669.165,3679.976,"From addressing the Harms and Traumas of the last year and a half, which have taken a toll on each and every person in our community.",79,,
515,0.97,3679.976,3682.211,"As always, those Harms have not fallen equally on our communities.",79,,
516,0.97,3682.211,3691.888,"We know that Bipoc communities, immigrants, refugees and those without technology access or mobility have been the hardest hit.",79,,
517,0.97,3691.888,3697.393,To truly build back better we have to target these precious recovery funds to those who need them most.,79,,
518,0.97,3697.393,3702.565,Who are the farthest from recovery.,79,,
519,0.97,3702.565,3707.904,We know that families are still struggling to meet the basic needs of their children and keep food on the table.,79,,
520,0.97,3707.904,3713.91,Survivors of violence have been cut off from the network of support and crisis services.,79,,
521,0.97,3713.91,3719.715,A year of isolation and insecurity has taken its toll on the mental health of so many people in our community.,79,,
522,0.97,3719.715,3723.019,I've talked to a lot before about the shadow pandemic.,79,,
523,0.97,3723.019,3732.829,"Of the restricted movement, social isolation, and economic security has increased our vulnerability to violence and Self-Harm.",79,,
524,0.97,3732.829,3749.245,"But the Seattle rescue plan includes more than $35 million focused on trauma informed Well- being services to address the Seattle pandemic, including investments in senior isolation, mental and behavioral health, Gender-Based violence, they for distribution and free meals.",79,,
525,0.97,3749.245,3757.753,"With these investments, or families who have been the most impacted over the past year will have what they need to emerge stronger and healthier.",79,,
526,0.97,3757.753,3768.664,"I really want to thank our partners for their strong advocacy for these investments, including Tony Sartre and Seri Kota Roth at Westside baby.",79,,
527,0.97,3768.664,3772.135,Mary Ellen stone at King County central resource service.,79,,

529,0.97,3785.348,3793.356,"In areas where the proposed version of the bill didn't quite live up to the promise of the Council's intent resolution, Councilmember Mosqueda helped right the ship so that we could fulfill all of our commitments.",79,,
530,0.97,3793.356,3795.091,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",79,,
531,0.97,3795.091,3805.701,The packet now also includes critical investments in Seattle's creative economy as we promised to do in the Council's intent resolution.,79,,
532,0.97,3805.701,3816.078,The city's 2029 creative economies study found that the creative sector drives 18% of Seattle's GDP.,79,,
533,0.97,3816.078,3818.681,That is four times the national average.,79,,
534,0.97,3818.681,3829.025,"That means that the sector is so critical to Seattle's economic recovery, as well as being vital to making Seattle the unique and special place we love.",79,,
535,0.97,3829.025,3831.227,Artists and musicians have been uniquely hardly had.,79,,

539,0.97,3850.413,3862.625,"And for also creating a bond within the office of arts and culture to focus, target assistance on small and Bipoc led creative organizations so that they can reopen and bring back their staff.",79,,
540,0.97,3862.625,3870.466,This investment will help ensure our extraordinary creative communities are not yet another victim of the pandemic.,79,,
541,0.97,3870.466,3885.548,"Like I did for the advocates working for funding to address the saddle pandemic, I want to also thank you to advocates who have worked to ensure that these critical cultural economy investments are included.",79,,
542,0.97,3885.548,3893.789,Thanks to Seattle arts Commission so Cochairs and thank you as well to Seattle music Commission chair.,79,,
543,0.97,3893.789,3906.002,And the many musicians and artists who provided public testimony to help Council understand how they have been uniquely impacted and thank you for their extraordinary advocacy.,79,,
544,0.97,3906.002,3914.911,I want to also give a shout out to some of the work of my constituents in district 1 have organized over the past year to preserve one of the positive legacies of the pandemic.,79,,

548,0.97,3936.232,3942.438,"Just, we know that building back better means investing in those Furthest from recovery.",79,,
549,0.97,3942.438,3950.913,I'm glad to have had the opportunity to work with all of you to do that today and to underscore it with my vote.,79,,
550,0.97,3950.913,3951.414,Thanks.,79,,
551,0.97,3951.414,3953.816,Thank you so much Councilmember Herbold for those comments.,80,,
552,0.97,3953.816,3964.994,Are there any additional comments on the bill?,80,,
553,0.97,3965.394,3970.833,"I'm not seeing any other hands raised, but I would like to take an opportunity before I allow Councilmember Mosqueda to closeout debate on this bill.",80,,
554,0.97,3970.833,3983.479,"I would, as one of the cosponsors, like to take an opportunity to make my own comments about this particular suite of bills related to these vital funds.",80,,
555,0.97,3983.479,3993.189,"Council colleagues, again thank you so much for the opportunity to comment on this legislation, and for your strong collaboration and unification around the Seattle rescue plan.",80,,
556,0.97,3993.189,4003.899,"I am going to try not to duplicate many of the comments made by others, including the budget chair, but I did want to underscore some of the key highlights of this legislation from my perspective.",80,,
557,0.97,4003.899,4009.005,I'm proud of the hard work that went into creating a collaborative path to developing the Seattle rescue plan in the first place.,80,,
558,0.97,4009.005,4025.087,"I'm grateful to the budget chair, Mayor Durkan, as well as a number of Council and executive branch staff that spent weeks drafting this plan in a way that addresses the most pressing priorities and objectives.",80,,
559,0.97,4025.087,4028.524,"That were raised by Councilmembers, public Commenters, and Community-Based organizations.",80,,
560,0.97,4028.524,4043.406,The fact that budget legislation of this size received so few substantive amendments I think is Testament to the good work that was done to build a consensus back package for us to consider in committee and subsequently in today's full council meeting.,80,,
561,0.97,4043.406,4067.563,"Although $120 million is not sufficient to meet the various critical needs facing our city's residents, we have a unique opportunity with this funding to make a difference in the lives of countless Seattleites and set our city on a path toward a more equitable economic recovery from the Covid-19 public health and economic crises.",80,,
562,0.97,4067.563,4071.367,I am truly excited about the resources being provided in this legislation to do some of the following.,80,,
563,0.97,4071.367,4074.17,Expand affordable housing opportunities and homelessness services.,80,,
564,0.97,4074.17,4082.478,"Provide direct support to small businesses, workers and neighborhood commercial districts across the city.",80,,
565,0.97,4082.478,4085.047,Increase Childcare infrastructure and enhance wages for child care workers.,80,,
566,0.97,4085.047,4099.595,"This infusion of resources will help Home-Based and day care centers reopen, or expand, which will ultimately grow our city's Childcare network and allow parents to get back to work.",80,,
567,0.97,4099.595,4104.266,We will also invest in the reopening of cultural and arts institutions.,80,,
568,0.97,4104.266,4112.408,"We will reactivate and enhance our public spaces like parks and streets for outdoor recreation, commercial opportunities and socially distanced activities.",80,,
569,0.97,4112.408,4118.08,And this package offers direct cash assistance to those who have been most impacted by the pandemic.,80,,
570,0.97,4118.08,4137.733,These critical investments made in the Seattle rescue plan could not be possible without the hard work of our state's congressional delegation as well.,80,,
571,0.97,4138.067,4142.438,We want to thank them for their efforts in passing the American rescue plan act to begin with.,80,,
572,0.97,4142.438,4150.145,"I am very grateful to our Federal representatives and president Joe Biden for ensuring that these needed resources are made available to local governments, and of course our residents.",80,,
573,0.97,4150.145,4170.166,"Finally, in closing out my comments, I would be Remiss if I didn't acknowledge the fact that had this Council, led by Councilmember Mosqueda and a broad coalition of Stakeholders, had this Council not passed the Jumpstart Seattle progressive payroll tax in 2020, we would not be in a position to be making any of these investments.",80,,
574,0.97,4170.166,4186.482,"Without the roughly $200 million in revenue expected from the Jumpstart Seattle progressive payroll tax, we would have been forced to lay off hundreds of city of Seattle employees and drastically reduce city services.",80,,
575,0.97,4186.482,4195.491,"Without that revenue, we would be using all of the funds from the American rescue plan act to plug holes in the city's budget.",80,,
576,0.97,4195.491,4201.864,And simply restore spending and services to Pre-Pandemic levels.,80,,
577,0.97,4201.864,4224.186,"Fortunately, thanks to the tremendous work that was done to pass Jumpstart Seattle, and to defend its legality in court, we are in this position today to use these Federal dollars to greatly expand the services and resources our city is able to offer as we look towards rebuilding equitably across our city.",80,,
578,0.97,4224.186,4236.498,"So, I want to say thank you to all of you, my Council colleagues, and in particular, to our budget chair, Teresa Mosqueda.",80,,
579,0.97,4236.498,4247.61,"As well as all our community partners who have helped us to set a course toward a robust and equitable recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic both in the economic context, and in the public health context.",80,,
580,0.97,4247.61,4250.646,"So, thank you so much for the opportunity to make some comments.",80,,
581,0.97,4250.646,4266.962,"Again, I really want to lift up the tremendous amount of work that our legislative staff and our city budget office staff, and Mayoral staff have done to bring a consensus package forward that is a good moment for us as a city family.",80,,
582,0.97,4266.962,4287.483,I especially want to thank Councilmember Mosqueda's partnership and her office and my office for all of the countless amount of hours we have spent together working on these issues with staff.,80,,
583,0.97,4287.483,4297.893,"Thank you, everyone for all of your important work on this really, really important piece of legislation.",80,,
584,0.97,4297.893,4301.697,"That being said, I'm going to hand it back over to Councilmember Mosqueda who is going to closeout debate.",80,,
585,0.97,4301.697,4303.799,"Then, we will be able to vote on this bill.",80,,
586,0.97,4303.799,4307.069,"Thank you, Council President.",81,,
587,0.97,4307.069,4310.072,"Thank you very much for your remarks as well, especially about Jumpstart.",81,,
588,0.97,4310.072,4312.875,It has been tremendous to be able to work with you and your team.,81,,
589,0.97,4312.875,4313.575,Thank you very much.,81,,
590,0.97,4313.575,4318.28,"Colleagues, this is our chance.",81,,
591,0.97,4318.28,4321.817,This is our chance to build back better and it's our chance to build back more equitably.,81,,
592,0.97,4321.817,4330.125,"The Seattle rescue plan act here today, again the first of three asked to come this year, help to ensure that the critical dollars are going to where they are most needed.",81,,
593,0.97,4330.125,4343.405,"Attachment number one that you found from alley, it summarizes $49.2 million into housing and homelessness.",81,,
594,0.97,4343.405,4346.241,$41 million into community Well- being to address the trauma that so many have been through.,81,,
595,0.97,4346.241,4349.244,And are still dealing with.,81,,
596,0.97,4349.244,4353.549,$23.5 million into community and small business recovery.,81,,
597,0.97,4353.549,4364.059,"And over $14 million going into community assistance, city programming, and city services and our critical city workers.",81,,
598,0.97,4364.059,4368.363,"This is a package we can all be proud of, and a packet that we can build on for the future.",81,,
599,0.97,4368.363,4372.768,Tranche two will be discussed later this year when we consider the 2022 budget.,81,,
600,0.97,4372.768,4387.583,"We'll have a chance in just the next few weeks, starting in July, to look at Seattle rescue plan two, which will be a combination of funding that comes from the Federal Government that relates to the older Americans act funding.",81,,
601,0.97,4387.583,4388.884,Rental assistance.,81,,
602,0.97,4388.884,4392.554,Transportation funds from the Federal Government.,81,,
603,0.97,4392.554,4397.259,So many more pieces to help us center our recovery efforts.,81,,
604,0.97,4397.259,4414.109,"Again, thank you to our congressional delegation as the Council President rightly mentioned, for helping to free up these much-needed dollars to cities across the country, and especially to the city of Seattle, where we continue to deal with five and six years now of a crisis in housing and homelessness that has only been made worse by the Covid pandemic.",81,,
605,0.97,4414.109,4430.292,"So, this is truly an incredible opportunity to set the course to write our investments now and begin building on those in the upcoming months.",81,,
606,0.97,4430.292,4436.064,"I want to thank every Councilmember offered amendments as you all discussed in your summary of your amendments, Councilmember Strauss I heard you this morning say some great comments.",81,,

683,0.97,4947.943,4959.521,It makes some important updates building on the deep changes that were rooted in community needs and suggestions that we took in my committee back in 2019.,94,,
684,0.97,4959.521,4984.179,Those changes included expanding upon and clarifying the city's intent to use community preference and affirmative marketing policies as a framework of the policy framework for ensuring that those who have been most disproportionately impacted by displacement had a strong opportunity to remain in our city and have access to affordable housing.,94,,
685,0.97,4984.179,4999.794,At that point we included stronger labor standards to make sure that our new housing that was being built had opportunities for greater labor standards and that we look for opportunities to strengthen our commitment to good living wage jobs as we dealt housing.,94,,
686,0.97,4999.794,5006.968,Language on that should be forthcoming in a report and other work that we did as well.,94,,
687,0.97,5006.968,5015.276,We also at that point increased office of housing's acquisition authority up to a cap of $30 million at the time.,94,,
688,0.97,5015.276,5022.884,A lot of that work that we did in 2019 was really rooted in a number of community Roundtable discussions that we had.,94,,
689,0.97,5022.884,5028.156,Specifically with Bipoc led housing development groups and communities who are most in need of affordable housing in this city.,94,,

691,0.97,5046.341,5059.354,This does not include major policy directive changes given that this is a proposal I think that was really Well-Crafted as it was sent to us and included some of the previous work that we had done just two years ago.,94,,
692,0.97,5059.354,5069.764,Is a few things really excited about in this legislation.,94,,
693,0.97,5069.764,5077.138,"If you haven't had a chance to hear me say this before, this is a really great opportunity to increase the homeownership subsidies to make sure we are adequately funding the construction of permanent affordable homes.",94,,

695,0.97,5084.946,5093.555,"We are in this legislation removing that cap previously we had upped the cap on the acquisition authority, now we are removing it.",94,,
696,0.97,5093.555,5105.7,"The Office of housing has the authority, where needed, when there is no revenue available, to quickly move and seize opportunities to acquire property for the creation of affordable housing, giving the changing market conditions we are seeing.",94,,
697,0.97,5105.7,5112.006,Why is this important right now?,94,,
698,0.97,5112.006,5121.783,"If we see Multi-Structures going on the market or derelict buildings that we could be using for affordable housing now, or in the future, we want to be competitive and to bring in more publicly owned housing options.",94,,
699,0.97,5121.783,5126.421,"And create public opportunities for folks to have access to good, affordable housing within the city.",94,,
