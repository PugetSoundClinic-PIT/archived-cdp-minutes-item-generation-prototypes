180,0.97,1038.537,1068.1,"But I do want to just for the viewing public let folks know this does not change the appropriation . It LIFTS a proviso for the additional funding for electronic home monitoring and just quickly, sorry, the CBA, original CBI had proviso funding for monitoring so that we received, could receive some baseline data on utilization of the program for misdemeanor defendants.",48,,
181,0.97,1068.1,1083.415,"But the courts have exhausted the ongoing appropriation for this funding during the first quarter . and so, without this additional funding released indigent defendants would not be able to afford to pay for electronic home monitoring.",48,,
182,0.97,1083.415,1085.884,Without the subsidy.,48,,
183,0.97,1085.884,1087.519,So that is the sense of urgency.,48,,

213,0.97,1371.002,1388.153,And what are we doing to help people understand what that really looks like and how that is a different set of health issues that we need to be prepared to deal with in the community.,48,,
214,0.97,1388.153,1394.426,"We also talked a lot about sound transit, Lake Washington Boulevard and increasing services for our in-house population.",48,,

224,0.97,1463.895,1473.638,Especially at the rate at which Removals are happening.,49,,
225,0.97,1473.638,1479.144,I think it's important to remember we have a ninth Circuit Court case that says people cannot be moved if they don't have a place to go.,49,,
226,0.97,1479.144,1489.888,"We already know what we are doing to remove people, but I would still like to know the answer to the question of what we are doing to dramatically increase places for people to go.",49,,

234,0.97,1524.856,1551.049,"As the sponsor of the legislation that created the city holiday, it was important to me that as we continue to acknowledge the profound role that slavery played in shaping the institutions of our country, and continues to play in our government systems, whether we are talking about Land-Use codes, public education system, labor codes, it is important that we as a municipality also acknowledge this important day.",49,,
235,0.97,1551.049,1564.696,Last month I had the honor of joining former Councilmember Larry Gossett with the discussion at the reparations Commission to discuss how we can begin to build a culture of repair.,49,,

250,0.97,1649.748,1657.455,"On the agenda for Wednesday, June 15, we have a member of the housing Livvie oversight committee.",50,,
251,0.97,1657.455,1676.041,I understand Cara is a former staff member of Councilmember Pedersen and is now the Mayor's housing lead and excited to continue to hear more about the housing Livvie oversight committee and the ways to be engaged.,50,,
252,0.97,1676.041,1685.316,"We will have legislation authorizes the lease of a property near I-5 and I-90 interchange, referred to as the Royal Brohm property.",50,,
253,0.97,1685.316,1696.594,Is a piece of property that we are going to be leasing from the Washington State Department of Transportation for city use.,50,,
254,0.97,1696.594,1714.546,"Lastly, excuse me, we will have an ordinance that will accept the grants and enable the human services Department to execute agreements with the funding agency, the ordinance will also create budget authority that is tied to specific grant agreements.",50,,
255,0.97,1714.546,1745.009,"Lastly we will have legislation that I am really excited about, so I'm going to do a drum roll here, this is the piece of legislation we have been helping a partnership with our community housing Roundtable group, a group of about 30-40 community partners were largely folks of color working in communities and folks of displacement who are in the area of building affordable housing and expanding much of what the community oriented services due to include housing.",50,,
256,0.97,1745.009,1781.112,"Historically providing meals and learning support, adult learning, and because of the work they did to expand housing, at the Plaza.Com--so many community organizations that we have worked with over the years that are taking the reins and building housing through the lens of what community wants to prevent displacement and also to create home, like building affordable housing around plazas and in public parks and tied to Childcare facilities, small business opportunities.",50,,
257,0.97,1781.112,1792.223,"Especially for Bipoc small business owners, this is a really great opportunity for community Roundtable discussions to hear directly from them about what public policies they want to change.",50,,
258,0.97,1792.223,1804.002,Pretty much every single public policy I worked on in the last five years related to affordable housing has come directly from community at that table who identified public policy changes they want to see.,50,,
259,0.97,1804.002,1820.718,"Everything from increasing the ability to use affirmative marketing and community preference, to preventing us from selling off public land.",50,,
260,0.97,1827.358,1829.727,And keeping in public hands to be used for the public good.,50,,
261,0.97,1829.727,1831.429,And Prioritizing affordable housing on that public property.,50,,
262,0.97,1831.429,1840.305,To making sure we increase the ability for us to have land acquisition opportunities by lifting the cap so there was more funding for acquisition at the office of housing that we can pass on to the nonprofit organizations led by community's of color.,50,,
263,0.97,1840.305,1849.414,And the last idea that we heard mid year last year was the concept of removing a requirement that the office of housing previously had to require an organization to partner with established housing developers.,50,,
264,0.97,1849.414,1863.027,The piece of legislation that we will have in front of us on Wednesday is in conjunction with the community housing Roundtable and our office of housing partners.,50,,
265,0.97,1863.027,1872.871,We have come up with a piece of legislation we are calling the community self-determination Fund.,50,,
266,0.97,1872.871,1889.053,"We are creating a fund within the office of housing and modifying the policies within the housing funding policies to create funding specifically from Jumpstart, Jumpstart funding used for acquisition and preservation, and we are going to be directing the funding to work with organizations who are interested in building and operating affordable housing with different eligibility criteria.",50,,
267,0.97,1889.053,1906.971,The funds are intended to contribute to the city's Equable development goal by investing in organizations and projects working to address displacement and address the Long-Standing harm of discriminatory housing policies.,50,,
268,0.97,1906.971,1908.339,There are four things this fund will do.,50,,
269,0.97,1908.339,1919.517,First it will provide Much- needed capacity funding along with permanent acquisition Fundings organizations are able to secure land and develop community driven housing with full ownership and full Self- determination over that property.,50,,
270,0.97,1919.517,1933.731,"The fund, Secondly, has eligibility requirements Pager tailored to small organizations that have traditionally been excluded from the portal housing area and industry.",50,,
271,0.97,1933.731,1935.066,So we are creating more opportunity.,50,,
272,0.97,1935.066,1939.837,"Finally, this fund is permanent in nature.",50,,
273,0.97,1939.837,1952.817,It creates a fun source to allow flexible development Timelines so that organizations can secure land and work on developing a community vision of what housing should be without having to partner with outside organizations.,50,,
274,0.97,1952.817,1963.394,So we initially had been talking about how removing the patriarchal covenants that requires many organizations that are community color led to partner with larger established groups.,50,,
275,0.97,1963.394,1967.098,This really removes that requirement so that we can move forward with building affordable housing.,50,,
276,0.97,1967.098,1973.137,Not only more quickly but also in the lens of the community organizations and what they want.,50,,
277,0.97,1973.137,1981.479,It also includes a developer fee at the beginning of the Timelines organizations have the needed financial resources to to the planning.,50,,
278,0.97,1981.479,1988.486,And to do the Pre-Development work that is often so cumbersome at the front end of building affordable housing.,50,,
279,0.97,1988.486,1997.362,"And, had in the past, prevented small developers for moving forward.",50,,
280,0.97,1997.362,1998.963,Is a very exciting piece of legislation.,50,,
281,0.97,1998.963,2003.801,We try to come up with a name that would make it not offensive in the community Self- determination fund is what we came up with.,50,,
282,0.97,2003.801,2011.342,I look forward to voting with that on Wednesday.,50,,
283,0.97,2011.342,2013.578,Thank you for letting me take time to talk about that.,50,,
284,0.97,2013.578,2020.018,And the work we are trying to do to expedite this can be a partnership with taking public land off the private market and using it for public good.,50,,
285,0.97,2020.018,2023.087,And finding displacement.,50,,
286,0.97,2023.087,2045.076,"Finally, at the Council meeting tomorrow, as the Council President noted, we're going to have the opportunity to finalize the appointment of Michael Winkler chin as a director, the Council President has provided her concurrence to allow this appointment to be placed on tomorrow's city council meeting agenda as she noted.",50,,
287,0.97,2045.076,2059.657,"I will be asking to suspend the rules to allow for this appointment to be considered tomorrow, since I did not do that on Thursday, I will be asking for the procedural motion to do that Tomorro.",50,,
288,0.97,2059.657,2062.693,"With your blessing, colleagues, we will get the final confirmation done.",50,,
289,0.97,2062.693,2089.253,"Last week on Thursday I have the chance to meet with Councilmember Pedersen and so many of our state legislative partners like repetitive Paulette, Senator Valdes, and Department of neighborhood representatives as well to join in the celebration at the University heights center.",50,,
290,0.97,2089.253,2094.092,Located in Councilmember Pedersen's district.,50,,
291,0.97,2094.092,2106.437,"It's been the center of where folks come to get Childcare, adult learning programs, youth theater programs which we saw a little example of.",50,,
292,0.97,2106.437,2112.076,It is really a great Hub that has been a public place preserved.,50,,
293,0.97,2112.076,2113.911,It's a very old building.,50,,
294,0.97,2113.911,2134.832,We are thankful to Councilmember Pedersen's work to make sure in the budget last year that I asked for the Speaker system was included and we also worked to support the request of theirs for an elevator to ensure it was truly accessible and equitable for all in our community.,50,,
295,0.97,2134.832,2147.612,"I want to thank Congresswoman who when we sent a request in for Federal assistance for the elevator, their team said this is a great idea and we are going to triple the request.",50,,
296,0.97,2147.612,2162.059,They were there as well to celebrate the opening of the elevators and people grabbed a shovel and celebrated the fact that the project is underway to get an elevator installed switch truly accessible.,50,,
297,0.97,2162.059,2177.475,"I hope you have a chance to join in Councilmember Morales in D 2. so many legislative members, we were joined at the Filipino community center for the grand opening of their 94 units of affordable senior housing.",50,,
298,0.97,2177.475,2206.103,"This is a piece of property that since day one of being in office they had been trying to get additional funding over to the Filipino community center and in all of our office of housing changes we made in the past, greatly informed by Gloria and Emma and so many at the Filipino community center who been saying, we want to build this but we want to make it easier for folks to come behind us to do.",50,,
299,0.97,2206.103,2213.411,Just like they said they wanted to do for the folks were doing the type affordable housing we see underway.,50,,
300,0.97,2213.411,2217.315,They said they have a lot of lessons learned from this property so more people can open affordable housing.,50,,
301,0.97,2217.315,2218.749,This is truly an incredible center.,50,,
302,0.97,2218.749,2221.152,94 units of affordable housing with the Childcare center on the first floor.,50,,

317,0.97,2283.981,2303.834,"Last week city attorney Davidson and I were invited by life on Mars owner and Exp host John Richards to meet with several owners of Capitol Hill Nightlife businesses that included wild rose, St. John's and several others.",51,,
318,0.97,2303.834,2307.471,To talk about public safety issues.,51,,
319,0.97,2307.471,2323.32,"The immediate concerns were about safety and security for pride weekend because, although they all hire private security, they are concerned about what happens to patrons once they leave the businesses.",51,,
320,0.97,2323.32,2328.592,"When I say they hire private security, I learned that costs up to $35,000 for three days.",51,,
321,0.97,2328.592,2334.899,So other issues discussed were a strong desire for foot patrol.,51,,
322,0.97,2334.899,2341.605,Beat cops on foot along Capitol Hill.,51,,
323,0.97,2341.605,2356.62,And I learned about an issue that wasn't on my radar which is Unpermitted food carts that cater to people leaving bars at 2:00 and the crowds that they generate which can be unruly.,51,,
324,0.97,2356.62,2359.423,Those were a couple of the many issues we discussed at that meeting.,51,,
325,0.97,2359.423,2377.274,"I have to mention that this obviously is not an issue confined to Capitol Hill, and I mention this because I just got attacked from a constituent who let me know that Bizarro restaurant in Wallingford was broken into and ransacked last night.",51,,
326,0.97,2377.274,2387.318,"The owner is devastated and this constituent asked, what can I tell him, the owner, of city support?",51,,
327,0.97,2387.318,2392.656,Clearly an issue still top of mind to business owners and residents of Seattle.,51,,
328,0.97,2392.656,2399.163,"Let's see, also last week I attended and spoke at the South Lake Union Chamber of Commerce meeting.",51,,
329,0.97,2399.163,2405.369,And our office toured the climate pledge arena.,51,,
330,0.97,2405.369,2418.783,"The tour was guided by former city council member Johnson, vp of government affairs at Seattle Cracken Eric Pettigrew and executive vice president general Council.",51,,
331,0.97,2418.783,2424.488,It is fair to say we were blown away by the beauty of the arena.,51,,
332,0.97,2424.488,2425.723,It was my first time there.,51,,
333,0.97,2425.723,2443.774,And all of the sustainable operating systems and features that make it the nation's first net carbon zero arena.,51,,
334,0.97,2450.147,2456.387,"I am talking, when I say systems I am talking about everything from the food offerings provided, local food offerings, a certain percentage, I believe it's 30%, I could be wrong.",51,,
335,0.97,2456.387,2458.055,"To water recaptured, to being 100% electric power.",51,,
336,0.97,2458.055,2462.393,"I urge anybody to visit, if not for an event, ask for a tour and you can get the whole story.",51,,
337,0.97,2462.393,2468.966,Our tour guides reinforced for us how important improvements at the Seattle center Monorail station are.,51,,
338,0.97,2468.966,2477.675,"That station, as I mentioned before, handles a surge of 3000 riders per hour after events.",51,,
339,0.97,2477.675,2480.144,And that is right now.,51,,
340,0.97,2480.144,2490.087,And Ridership will be steeply increased once construction on chance at three begins.,51,,
341,0.97,2490.087,2495.359,Because many people take that option to the event.,51,,
342,0.97,2495.359,2507.338,They mentioned that Seattle center is lead on this issue of station improvements and they are working with Sdot to develop a budget request that will be coming our way soon.,51,,
343,0.97,2507.338,2515.279,"Let's see, I was honored to attend the Northwest African American museums Pre-Juneteenth mixer.",51,,
344,0.97,2515.279,2525.422,"This was put on for supporters, past and present, board members, and also staff.",51,,
345,0.97,2525.422,2531.328,"It was basically gearing up for a week full of events happening now, many different kinds of Juneteenth events.",51,,
346,0.97,2531.328,2541.438,They wild the guest in attendance with the launch of the new flyer called the African American cultural ensemble.,51,,
347,0.97,2541.438,2547.177,It will be performing also during this week's event.,51,,
348,0.97,2547.177,2554.485,"Finally they announced the Museum itself will be reopening, if not before, then on November 30 this year.",51,,
349,0.97,2554.485,2558.122,That is great news.,51,,
350,0.97,2558.122,2570.1,"And then, finally, another event last week, I attended the Seattle Council's annual event.",51,,
351,0.97,2570.1,2587.251,"Most of the Sidebars and keynote addresses were all about one thing, how do we make building housing, especially multifamily housing, less expensive and easier to meet our housing goals? especially during the Affordability crisis.",51,,
352,0.97,2587.251,2590.287,We are going to be able to subsidize our way out of this problem.,51,,
353,0.97,2590.287,2602.833,"Everyone agrees that we need to remove, identify and remove regulatory barriers, building code barriers, et cetera, to make this happen.",51,,
354,0.97,2602.833,2618.482,"Likely there were many Department the staff there including from city like, Sdot as well as leadership director Nathan of SD Ci and Marco and of course the Mayor himself gave the keynote address.",51,,
355,0.97,2618.482,2627.591,It was good to see everyone in the same room having conversations about the same thing.,51,,
356,0.97,2627.591,2628.192,And its urgency.,51,,
357,0.97,2628.192,2632.896,This week I will be attending an event put on by friends of waterfront Seattle.,51,,
358,0.97,2632.896,2633.497,They have moved.,51,,
359,0.97,2633.497,2637.735,They have a new location at the residence at Reindeer square.,51,,
360,0.97,2637.735,2647.711,I will be speaking to educate the community and cultivate an interest in the waterfront project.,51,,
361,0.97,2647.711,2660.657,"A lot of the residence, the residences here in this building are either new to the region or young and they haven't heard much about this project.",51,,
362,0.97,2660.657,2668.232,"So that will be exciting, first of all, to go to an event at this new building and speak with people that are new to the project.",51,,
363,0.97,2668.232,2673.57,"And, sparking interest and generates enthusiasm.",51,,
364,0.97,2673.57,2685.449,"Let's see, Friday I will be in Kitsap County attending the regional connections tour which is hosted by PS RC for board members and alternates.",51,,
365,0.97,2685.449,2691.889,And it is also part of the economic the district.,51,,

376,0.97,2746.577,2755.886,Council 322 ACCEPTS an easement from the State Department of natural resources for a replacement sewer line under Santa Fe waterway.,52,,
377,0.97,2755.886,2770.0,120323 is essentially technical correction because it ACCEPTS two property deeds to perfect the property rights of Seattle owned utilities for those two parcels originally acquired in 1906.,52,,
378,0.97,2770.0,2772.636,Both bills were unanimously committed by our committee.,52,,
379,0.97,2772.636,2784.014,"Our next Committee on transportation is scheduled for next Tuesday, June 21 at 9:30 am.",52,,
380,0.97,2784.014,2786.517,At that June 21 committee I anticipate we will consider several items.,52,,

383,0.97,2795.793,2810.04,We already circulated the Mayor's appointment packets you and it was on the introductory referral calendar a few weeks ago.,52,,
384,0.97,2810.04,2814.478,As with all of the Mayor's appointments thus far the Council sent questions to the nominee about their experience of priorities.,52,,
385,0.97,2814.478,2817.948,And my office circulated director these answers to the questions.,52,,
386,0.97,2817.948,2822.986,In Vetting nominees are Council committees have taken your one or two meetings to vote.,52,,
387,0.97,2822.986,2824.221,We will see how it goes.,52,,
388,0.97,2824.221,2840.103,"We may want a second meeting to discuss the cost of utility bills that constituents receive, as well as get the most recent information on the timing and cost of one of Seattle's is the capital projects, the ship Canal water quality control project.",52,,
389,0.97,2840.103,2850.414,At the June 21 committee we also plan to hear from Sdot vision zero team to get an update on their efforts to reduce traffic related fatalities and serious injuries.,52,,
390,0.97,2850.414,2866.129,At that committee will also vote on Council bill 345 to grant approval to vacate a portion of 29th Avenue Southwest and Southwest U Street adjacent to port of Seattle and in West Seattle.,52,,

395,0.97,2912.576,2917.047,Rather than rushing to the next Committee in June 21 our second committee meeting and vote is likely to be later in July.,52,,
396,0.97,2917.047,2953.216,"Council members can reach out to her analyst to provide their early input and of course we are already ably presented on sound transport by her own Council President . I understand the councils likely to vote on Tuesday, July 5 to reconsider Mayor Harrell's veto of Council bill 120325 which was a legislative proposal aiming to require the collection of rental rate information in hopes of preventing displacement of economic horrible residence.",52,,
397,0.97,2953.216,2960.324,I appreciate the Council President scheduling the vote on whether to sustain or override the veto for when we are all able to attend.,52,,
398,0.97,2960.324,2965.195,Majority of Councilmembers obviously supported the bill so the veto is disappointing.,52,,
399,0.97,2965.195,2969.666,As Councilmember Morales expressed and I expressed.,52,,
400,0.97,2969.666,2977.574,"For the four Polys who did not vote in favor, please know I am available to discuss with any of you further.",52,,
401,0.97,2977.574,2991.221,"The Mayor is reconsidering July 5. if cost was your chief concern, we have since done additional research on health several other cities have similar programs to collect rental rate information to help prevent displacement.",52,,
402,0.97,2991.221,2996.827,And how the cost figures put forward earlier are much higher than what other cities have achieved.,52,,
403,0.97,2996.827,3006.837,"District 4, first, it was one year ago today, June 13, when our city government lost a Coworker.",52,,
404,0.97,3006.837,3017.314,Spd officer Harris was struck and killed by a vehicle on I-5 will try to help others involved in an earlier collision.,52,,

407,0.97,3037.3,3049.913,And over the past week I attended six roll calls of the Seattle police Department North precinct including the one starting at 3 am and 3:30 am.,52,,
408,0.97,3049.913,3055.852,"I let the officers know I appreciate the good work these front-line city employees do for our residents, businesses and encourage them to stay in Seattle.",52,,
409,0.97,3055.852,3068.398,I'm very Concerne about the police staffing crisis after having lost over 300 officers and detectives over the past 2.5 years.,52,,
410,0.97,3068.398,3079.776,"No other city Department has lost over one third of its front-line workers . and four Department needed for a Holistic approach to public safety, I believe this warrants special attention.",52,,
411,0.97,3079.776,3085.315,Based on what I heard directly firsthand at these roll calls there is a lot of work that needs to be done to rebuild trust.,52,,
412,0.97,3085.315,3089.119,I encourage those who have not had the opportunity to attend a rollcall to attend one when you can.,52,,
413,0.97,3089.119,3118.315,"I am concerned the attrition of officers and detectives is going to be worse in 18 days because of a new state law 17 on one, 1701 Unfortunately that financially Incentivizes officers retirement . I look forward to the Mayor's forthcoming safety plan that hopefully includes a compelling strategy for not only recruiting, but also maintaining our experienced officers.",52,,
414,0.97,3118.315,3128.725,I believe we need to refocus efforts on tension so we retain highly trained officers.,52,,
415,0.97,3128.725,3131.761,Recruiting takes a long time and we are losing many more officers and we are recruiting.,52,,
