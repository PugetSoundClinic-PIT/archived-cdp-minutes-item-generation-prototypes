164,0.8903719186782837,1052.2,1057.1," Council members, I will lead things off for the human services department issue.",,,
165,0.8903719186782837,1057.1,1065.9,Identification discussion and want would request that you turn your attention to page one where you'll find the Department's revenue and expenditure table.,,,
166,0.8903719186782837,1065.9,1068.5,I'll just note here that hsd budget.,,,
167,0.8903719186782837,1068.5,1077.6,"HST is budget reflects about a 2.3 percent increase over the 2014 endorsed budget, which equates to about a net increase of 3 million dollars.",,,
168,0.8903719186782837,1077.6,1081.8,"On the top of page 2, you will find a bar graph.",,,
169,0.9034453630447388,1082.3,1098.1," Illustrates the Department's Revenue over time and the yellow bar at the bottom represents, the amount of General sub fund revenues while the three varying Shades of Grey represent, external funding sources.",,,
170,0.8941301703453064,1098.9,1116.3," The key takeaway here is you'll notice that the general fund has grown rather substantially since 2011, from approximately 51 million dollars to the proposed 67 million dollars in 2014, this represents a 31 percent increase.",,,
171,0.8941301703453064,1116.3,1124.1,"And at the same time, the external revenues have declined by approximately three and a half percent over that same period.",,,
172,0.8941301703453064,1124.9,1128.9,"Now, some of this is attributable to a series of",,,
173,0.7533081769943237,1129.0,1131.5, Federal and state budget reductions.,,,
174,0.7533081769943237,1132.1,1142.6,"But also the last few years, the city has seen some administrative changes from the fat from the federal government and the state and particular as it relates to Medicaid.",,,
175,0.7533081769943237,1142.6,1143.6,Reimbursement.,,,
176,0.7533081769943237,1143.7,1156.9,"For some of the activities that the Department's Aging and Disability Services had been responsible for in terms of pass through funding, those have been restored back to the responsibility of the state.",,,
177,0.7533081769943237,1156.9,1158.2,So that is also,,,
178,0.8377349972724915,1159.1,1170.0," An example of why the federal and state revenues, they have declined a bit and also over time there is some normal churn of expiring grants which is also reflected here.",,,
179,0.8377349972724915,1171.4,1187.3,Now it's been noted on a few occasions but I think it's worth mentioning again that this does Mark the first time to our knowledge at least that the city's general fund support to the human services department will exceed that of the combined external Revenue sources.,,,
180,0.7751420736312866,1190.6,1198.2," One is shell node here though, is that Council may want to keep an eye on this trend as it.",,,
181,0.7751420736312866,1198.2,1207.0,"Ideally we would want to see hsd pursue and secure more partnership funding from, look for local initiatives in particular, for those that are Regional in nature.",,,
182,0.7751420736312866,1207.8,1218.0,But we also hope to see that the additional general fund allocation through our contracts with community-based organizations is actually leveraging more private and public.,,,
183,0.9128385782241821,1218.2,1220.0, Dollars from other sources.,,,
184,0.8402485847473145,1222.0,1225.2, Now shifting from revenues to expenditures.,,,
185,0.8402485847473145,1225.3,1226.6,Can I can jump in there?,,,
186,0.8402485847473145,1226.7,1227.2,Yeah sure.,,,
187,0.8402485847473145,1227.4,1236.6,"So the graph here we're looking at is how our local dollars are leveraged with other sources that come through the city budget, right?",,,
188,0.8402485847473145,1236.6,1237.5,That's correct.,,,
189,0.8402485847473145,1237.5,1239.9,"And your last point if I understood it, right?",,,
190,0.8402485847473145,1239.9,1248.8,"Is Sometimes When We Make an investment in a local service provider, they will match our dollar with outside money to do.",,,
191,0.8402485847473145,1248.8,1250.8,We do we have a sense of,,,
192,0.7332472801208496,1251.9,1254.6, I think that or is that kind of an unknown.,,,
193,0.7332472801208496,1255.1,1258.5,"So council member and yes, so that's correct.",,,
194,0.7332472801208496,1258.5,1267.5,I was referring to the dollars that the city rfi's or contracts with Community agencies for which is often general fund.,,,
195,0.7332472801208496,1267.5,1272.7,But also some federal money is also allocated in that manner.,,,
196,0.7332472801208496,1273.1,1281.7,And the question is whether or not those dollars going to the at the agency level whether or not the agencies are utilizing those revenues in order to,,,
197,0.9111022353172302,1281.8,1283.9, act other other sources of revenue.,,,
198,0.9111022353172302,1283.9,1295.6,"And in most cases, presumably, that is the case because most of these agencies are using a mix of funding in order to provide the services that they deliver year in and year out, as far as whether or not.",,,
199,0.9111022353172302,1295.6,1300.2,The city is has a complete picture of what the leverage revenues are.,,,
200,0.9111022353172302,1300.4,1301.8,I think that is a work in progress.,,,
201,0.9111022353172302,1302.2,1309.6,The department has been working on enhancing its Contracting Division and requirements over the last several years.,,,
202,0.9111022353172302,1309.6,1311.2,We are,,,
203,0.9075758457183838,1311.8,1332.0," I think in some areas are able to see on a contract level, with a specific agency, what the totality of funding is for particular service, in others, not so much and I think that's something that we would want the department to continue to pursue in order to get a more complete picture of what our dollars are leveraging.",,,
204,0.9075758457183838,1333.1,1341.7,"Because I would think whether let's pick a partnership between us in the state, whether we contribute 100 state,",,,
205,0.8993080258369446,1341.8,1347.1, If it's $100 to us we match it with our hundred dollars and give $200 to the grantee that would show up on this chart one way.,,,
206,0.8993080258369446,1347.1,1359.5,"But if for whatever reason we contribute $100 to a provider who also secured a hundred dollars from the state, I'm somewhat indifferent, I think to how that flows but how we understand what's really happened in the community?",,,
207,0.8993080258369446,1359.5,1363.3,"If we don't have part of that picture, we're missing that completely.",,,
208,0.8993080258369446,1363.3,1365.2,"And so, I think it would be great.",,,
209,0.8993080258369446,1365.2,1371.7,"I don't know how long it would take to get there, but to be able to have that kind of Fuller, snapshot of what's being invested in, and",,,
210,0.884682297706604,1371.9,1373.3, I'll just add customer Brian.,,,
211,0.884682297706604,1373.3,1377.5,I think give it as we move through the issue identification.,,,
212,0.884682297706604,1377.5,1386.7,You'll note that in in several places we will be discussing what is characterized as general fund backfill for various services.,,,
213,0.884682297706604,1386.9,1394.6,And I think in those instances in particular I think this this issue of the total funding pictures is an interesting one.,,,
214,0.9023796319961548,1397.1,1409.3, So moving from the top of page 2 to the bottom of page two and the top of page 3 and shifting a little bit from the revenue picture to the expenditure side table to identifies.,,,
215,0.9023796319961548,1409.3,1419.2,"The, there are the department has six Strategic investment plan goals, technically, five and one that is intended to capture administrative and planning efforts.",,,
216,0.9023796319961548,1419.7,1422.8,But these five goal areas are effectively.,,,
217,0.9023796319961548,1422.8,1426.8,The way Council staff is utilized to organize.,,,
218,0.8092108368873596,1427.3,1431.5, Specific incremental allocations of the Department's.,,,
219,0.8092108368873596,1431.5,1446.3,"General fund Revenue in this year, the department in the proposed, budget will see A 5.6 million dollar increase in new general fund Appropriations and they are allocated in the front.",,,
220,0.8092108368873596,1446.3,1449.7,The goal areas accordingly as delineated on page 2.,,,
221,0.8092108368873596,1449.9,1456.6,The the one highlight I'll note here is that the vast majority of funding or majority of funding.,,,
222,0.8846331238746643,1457.3,1461.3," Moving towards the category of ending, homelessness and hunger.",,,
223,0.8846331238746643,1461.5,1466.2,And that's a trend that we've been seeing over the last several budget Cycles.,,,
224,0.8846331238746643,1466.9,1471.0,"So Mike your earlier point though, about this is that people shouldn't get too excited.",,,
225,0.8846331238746643,1471.0,1482.1,"That there's five point, six million dollars of new stuff happening because a big portion of this is making up for cuts that our partner agencies are suffering because of other other government.",,,
226,0.8846331238746643,1482.1,1486.1,"Cutbacks, is that other levels of government cutting back that's correctly.",,,
227,0.8890721201896667,1486.9,1502.3, My sort of rough calculation is that approximately a million dollars of that 5.6 is probably could be characterized as backfill and the rest is enhanced funding or new programming.,,,
228,0.8098103404045105,1504.7,1518.7," The graph on page 2 is also just as a depiction of those same six, Human Services, Strategic investment plan, goal areas, Delaney, ated stacked by funding over time.",,,
229,0.8098103404045105,1518.7,1522.5,And again this is just a reflection of the city general fund Investments.,,,

231,0.8523176312446594,1536.2,1542.9, So I can speak to the sequestration as it relates to hsts budget as far as across-the-board.,,,
232,0.8523176312446594,1542.9,1551.6,"Other program areas across the city, I'll defer to Beth, but the least and that is actually issue 11.1, which I'll move to next.",,,
233,0.8523176312446594,1551.6,1565.0,And I can discuss in Greater detail but sequestration as it relates to the human services department for Senior Services as good as as phased in over 2013 and 2014.,,,
234,0.8523176312446594,1565.3,1565.9,And that,,,
235,0.9128382802009583,1566.3,1569.1, At least for the senior services is approximately six hundred.,,,
236,0.9128382802009583,1569.1,1587.7,"Thirty thousand dollars, seven hundred thousand dollar range and I can get into more of that detail when we get the issues like where is the and these categories here, the cost of the 200,000 fit into that's being devoted to basic emergency shelter for families.",,,
237,0.8574564456939697,1589.3,1591.7, Council.,,,
238,0.8574564456939697,1591.7,1593.8,McLeod you're referring to a specific ad in the proposed.,,,

240,0.8574564456939697,1594.8,1604.6,"Well, so shelter funds would be in the ending homelessness and hunger category, which is the bar at the end, is the Bottom bar on graph to all right?",,,
241,0.7714318633079529,1607.4,1607.8, Okay.,,,
242,0.7714318633079529,1608.0,1611.0,If there are no questions will move into the issues.,,,
243,0.7714318633079529,1611.0,1619.6,And this is a rather lengthy list of issues and I'll just quickly sort of speak to how this is organized.,,,
244,0.7714318633079529,1619.8,1627.8,This particular year hsd was conveniently could be grouped into major funding categories.,,,
245,0.7714318633079529,1628.2,1635.3,"And in each category, you'll find issues they're identified for discussion issues for information purposes.",,,
246,0.781474232673645,1635.5,1647.3, Only unless otherwise directed by Council and then finally emerging issues and priorities as well as councilmember priorities and that's how each section will be broken up by.,,,
247,0.781474232673645,1648.0,1662.9,So I will lead off with issues related to senior programming and issue 1.1 as starts on the bottom of page 4 and this is related to 631 thousand dollars in proposed.,,,

277,0.9067699909210205,1900.4,1902.4,So I will speak to,,,
278,0.8550878167152405,1902.8,1906.2, My understanding is and then perhaps Beth has something to add the.,,,
279,0.8550878167152405,1906.5,1916.9,The I am not aware of any explicit conversations with regard to request for funding of United Way or King County as far as this particular budget.,,,
280,0.8550878167152405,1916.9,1917.1,Gap.,,,
281,0.8550878167152405,1917.1,1932.5,"Is concerned the Aging Area Agency on Aging, does have an advisory Council body that meets I believe what with regularity that did convene to discuss the potential reductions related to see.",,,
282,0.8039233088493347,1932.7,1940.2, Restoration and DSHS cuts and that advisory Council would certainly include King County and United Way's involvement.,,,
283,0.8039233088493347,1940.3,1947.9,"So as far as web of that at that time, the conversation primarily revolved around how to take the reductions that were anticipated.",,,
284,0.8039233088493347,1948.0,1951.6,And it's unclear to me whether or not subsequent to the mayor's proposed budget.,,,
285,0.8039233088493347,1951.6,1955.3,"If there was any follow up with regard to other agencies partnering, to fill the Gap.",,,
286,0.8039233088493347,1955.3,1962.6,"So the advisory body said, if there has to be a reduction, here's where they would recommend the reductions occur and that's",,,
287,0.88731849193573,1962.7,1964.1, What we see in your attachment.,,,
288,0.88731849193573,1964.1,1965.4,"A, that would be restored.",,,
289,0.88731849193573,1965.7,1966.4,That's correct.,,,
290,0.88731849193573,1966.6,1967.1,Okay.,,,
291,0.8574890494346619,1970.7,1978.9," So, the options I've listed here is option, A would be to reduce the city's general fund.",,,
292,0.8574890494346619,1978.9,1990.3,"Backfill to roughly a third of the 630,000 to be commensurate with the cities with the impact on City residents.",,,
293,0.8574890494346619,1990.8,2000.3,And one way to think of this would be to characterize this funding as matching funds to encourage the county or United Way or other funders to match.,,,
294,0.9115023612976074,2000.4,2003.1, Contribution in 2014 to fill the funding Gap.,,,
295,0.9115023612976074,2003.5,2029.9,"Alternatively option b would be to approve the full 631 thousand in general fund, backfill, and subsequently also, adopt a statement of legislative intent, that would clearly suggests that this was one time commitment for 2014 and then to request hsd and oir to, to begin working with the county and United Way.",,,
296,0.8705984354019165,2030.4,2035.6, As well as suburban cities potentially to develop a partnership plan for local funding beginning.,,,
297,0.8705984354019165,2035.6,2045.5,"In 2015, option C is a little nuanced, but it would also approve the six hundred and thirty thousand dollars and Adopt A sly.",,,
298,0.8705984354019165,2045.9,2055.4,"But in this instance, my I am suggesting that Council may want to look at this body of funding in a similar manner, as we currently do.",,,
299,0.8705984354019165,2055.4,2060.2,"With our relationship with Seattle, King County, Public Health, at which point",,,
300,0.9030804634094238,2060.5,2068.8," Is a base level of funding for countywide services, that senior that the AAA should be providing across the county.",,,
301,0.9030804634094238,2068.8,2070.4,And then subsequent to that.,,,
302,0.9030804634094238,2070.4,2074.9,If the city is inclined to continue making a ongoing general fund commitment to this.,,,
303,0.9030804634094238,2074.9,2080.4,"Body of work is to view it as a level of enhanced Services specifically, for Seattle residents.",,,
304,0.9030804634094238,2080.4,2089.0,"But in order to do so, there would be need to be a clear delineation of the city's funding relative to the federal and state money.",,,
305,0.9030804634094238,2089.0,2090.3,The other the larger,,,
306,0.8396444320678711,2090.4,2101.8, A pot of nearly 40 million dollars in order to ensure that the city's investments in fact are enhanced and not as perhaps currently proposed subsidizing situation.,,,
307,0.8396444320678711,2102.6,2109.3,And of course there are multiple variations on these but I think that captures a couple of different ways to go.,,,
308,0.8396444320678711,2109.6,2112.3,"So questions from console verges, know.",,,
309,0.8396444320678711,2112.4,2117.6,Okay I have a question that the options.,,,
310,0.8396444320678711,2117.6,2119.8,See what?,,,
311,0.833098292350769,2122.1,2133.1, Stop the county for moving funds from programs that they currently spend the city to the county and just having the city funds then pick up that that Gap.,,,
312,0.833098292350769,2134.7,2136.4,So Casper Mikado I think that would be.,,,
313,0.833098292350769,2137.1,2146.8,"So in the current Arrangement that we have with public health, we have an mou with the county that clearly delineates.",,,
314,0.833098292350769,2146.8,2149.7,What base level of funding expectations are.,,,
315,0.833098292350769,2149.9,2150.2,And then,,,
316,0.8462519645690918,2150.4,2155.5," Subsequently distinguish, the city's Revenue roughly, I think 12 or 13 million dollars.",,,
317,0.8462519645690918,2155.8,2160.4,That would specifically be separate contracts to services in in the city.,,,
318,0.8462519645690918,2160.6,2165.0,"Now, admittedly the tracking of what is Baseline versus what is enhanced.",,,
319,0.8462519645690918,2165.0,2180.2,"Is requires a certain amount due diligence to ensure there isn't some slipping on the back end but I think at the outset here, simply delineating or making clear through some sort of mou or there currently isn't it?",,,
320,0.8023720383644104,2180.4,2188.9," Agency agreement between United Way, King County in the city when it comes to AAA funding that some amendment to that document perhaps somewhere.",,,
321,0.8023720383644104,2188.9,2199.9,Some some codifying of an arrangement would certainly put the staff for the relative agencies on a path towards being able to swing distinguishing these resources.,,,
322,0.8023720383644104,2200.8,2206.1,"But it would require some ongoing monitoring of expenditures, right?",,,
323,0.7307049632072449,2211.7,2223.6, Thanks for asking to follow up on it because I did it because I think C is I don't think any of us are wild about being in this conversation and I'm sure that when the decisions were made to scale back the money that wasn't an easy decision for the groups that had to do that as well.,,,
324,0.7307049632072449,2223.6,2233.9,"So I think anybody likes being in the situation, I see is intriguing to me though, figuring out what's a base guaranteed level of service for seniors, no matter where they live in the county.",,,
325,0.9128382205963135,2235.4,2237.9, Having our partners be involved in that conversation to figure out.,,,
326,0.9128382205963135,2237.9,2244.9,"What's a sustainable way to do this over time, knowing that there will be other reductions coming and then figuring out.",,,
327,0.9128382205963135,2244.9,2253.8,What is it that we do as a city that is purchasing enhanced services for the seniors who live within our boundaries is option.,,,
328,0.9128382205963135,2253.8,2254.7,C is interesting.,,,
329,0.8171309232711792,2257.8,2264.3," council member Rasmussen or a hybrid, I think maybe Mike test upon that is",,,
330,0.864458441734314,2265.7,2271.0, Select option C but perhaps include funding sufficiently for Seattle residents.,,,
331,0.8317891359329224,2273.4,2274.9, Sufficient for Seattle residents.,,,
332,0.9128382802009583,2276.3,2277.5, Versus the entire County.,,,
333,0.9128382802009583,2280.1,2281.2,I would excuse me.,,,
334,0.9128382802009583,2281.2,2300.3,"I would remind my colleagues that this is one of many backfill measures in the budget and starting down this road, while certainly admirable and worthwhile over the coming years could cost us millions and millions of dollars.",,,
335,0.9128382802009583,2301.8,2304.0,"So I think we should be very, very cautious here.",,,
336,0.8919294476509094,2305.8,2306.4, Let's continue.,,,
337,0.8919294476509094,2308.1,2309.5,Okay issue.,,,
338,0.8919294476509094,2309.5,2320.6,"1 Point 2 is related to senior centers and the mayor has proposed an increase of general fund support by about two hundred, ten thousand dollars to the centers in 2014.",,,
339,0.8919294476509094,2321.1,2329.2,"Eight of the center's would receive twenty thousand dollars each and the South Park Senior Center will receive an allocation of 50,000 dollars.",,,

343,0.903674304485321,2348.0,2362.5,"And one of the background issues related to the City Senior Center funding is that funding has increased from approximately 130,000 dollars in 2005 to the 8.",,,

346,0.8981092572212219,2376.7,2394.4,"Until this year, the centers were still being paid on a unit cost basis where the unit being the hours of operation at each Center and the rate at which the centers were reimbursed at ranged from $9 per hour.",,,
347,0.8481655716896057,2394.9,2398.7, To as much as forty eight dollars an hour dependent upon the center.,,,
348,0.8481655716896057,2399.5,2409.2,Now some of this is because Pat in the past additional funding was added predominantly to address sort of immediate short-term funding.,,,
349,0.8481655716896057,2409.2,2424.2,"Shortfalls emergency needs to fill gaps in funding and the budgets of the senior centers and more recently, this year contracts are beginning to shift incrementally",,,
350,0.9128382205963135,2424.7,2434.0," More Performance Based, but still 90% of the contracts are for base pay while 10% is driven by performance.",,,
351,0.9128382205963135,2434.2,2454.5,But the performance metric is a count of the number of unduplicated clients that come in the door staff would still suggest that this approach is not necessarily rooted in demand or any particular need as the pain.,,,
352,0.8716083765029907,2454.6,2461.8, But rate is tied to historical funding levels rather than any needs assessment or determination by the department.,,,
353,0.8716083765029907,2461.9,2473.1,The bottom line is that the actual outcomes for the services are still unclear and the service area would appear to be ripe for a more comprehensive planning process.,,,
354,0.8716083765029907,2473.1,2480.1,"Such as the ones hsd does and other service areas for the city to be able, to better articulate.",,,

362,0.7359356880187988,2526.2,2544.2,The question is really the timing of that effort and without direction from Council the HR department would expect to have new contracts in place through a competitive process by 2016 and counsel may want to consider requesting acceleration of that process.,,,
363,0.9108098745346069,2545.3,2546.6, I'll pause here for a moment before.,,,
364,0.9108098745346069,2546.6,2547.6,Moving into options.,,,

539,0.784823477268219,3676.5,3685.2,It's likely that the recommendations emerging from this effort will have future public budget implications and you should anticipate future funding request.,,,

541,0.8666636347770691,3693.3,3704.6, Finally under the emerging issues and specific councilmember interest there is a request for funding made by.,,,
542,0.8666636347770691,3704.6,3714.8,"For Community Mental Health agencies, Atlantic Street center, Southeast Youth and Family Services, Southwest Youth and Family Services and Therapeutic Health Services.",,,

545,0.7666288018226624,3727.3,3732.4,The reason there's a range of costs is they have not picked a specific computer program.,,,
546,0.7666288018226624,3733.3,3741.6,"According to the agency's, the Affordable Care Act is requiring organizations that receive federal funds to use electronic health records.",,,

548,0.8149246573448181,3752.8,3755.3, So I would note a couple of things.,,,
549,0.8149246573448181,3755.5,3764.7,"One is, this seems to be a problem that has been created by an inconsistency between a federal requirement and federal funding eligibility.",,,
550,0.8149246573448181,3765.9,3767.0,It's not clear.,,,
551,0.8149246573448181,3767.0,3782.2,"If this is only incentive funding but what I've received from sources, is that it is incentive funding, that is available to hospitals and other direct medical providers but is not available to Community Based mental health providers,",,,
552,0.8858729600906372,3783.4,3799.4," Since it is a federal inconsistency that created this problem, a more effective solution may be to address this at the federal level and federal level of legislation has been introduced to extend the eligibility for this incentive program.",,,
553,0.8858729600906372,3799.4,3803.1,And the National Council for Behavioral Health is leading that effort.,,,
554,0.8858729600906372,3803.7,3812.4,"Secondly, mental health funding is under the purview of King County in the state and the state and County should take the lead in finding a solution.",,,
555,0.8039459586143494,3813.6,3831.0," As this is going to impact Community Mental Health Providers throughout the state, the Washington State Healthcare Innovation plan will be released at the end of October and may address this issue as the state is interested in building a Statewide robust Health Information, Technology infrastructure.",,,
556,0.8039459586143494,3831.6,3835.5,"And finally, I would note that computer systems are rarely one-time Investments.",,,

558,0.8949314951896667,3843.7,3847.0, You could should anticipate ongoing funding request in this area.,,,
559,0.8949314951896667,3847.5,3848.6,So I have two options.,,,
560,0.8949314951896667,3848.6,3860.8,I've identified one is to request the city's office of intergovernmental relations and the City's health policy advisor to work with King County in the state on potential federal state or County Solutions.,,,
561,0.8949314951896667,3860.8,3872.7,I would note that the executive position is they do prefer that federal funds and then maybe state county or private funds be used before seeking City resources for this.,,,
562,0.8237968683242798,3873.5,3878.6, And second option would be to provide the requested funding.,,,
563,0.8237968683242798,3878.6,3880.5,But request hsd to conduct.,,,

569,0.689714252948761,3910.1,3916.2,It's a tough situation where we're looking at the opportunity to really dramatically improve services for mental health.,,,
570,0.689714252948761,3916.2,3927.6,And yet it is not something directly in our normal purview and yet it's also something that's really vital if we're going to deal with some of the issues we have on our on our streets.,,,
571,0.689714252948761,3927.6,3932.7,And so I think we're just going to need to have some really careful discussions about this.,,,
572,0.689714252948761,3932.7,3933.3,And if the,,,

620,0.7816420197486877,4191.2,4193.1,We've identified three options here.,,,
621,0.7816420197486877,4194.1,4208.1,"Option A is we could add funding to existing programs to help move individuals and families off the streets and into Housing Programs were looking at could include housing stability, rapid rehousing, the late-night programme to help provide",,,

629,0.9007541537284851,4255.7,4259.7,And so some of that funding was used to provide new internal locks that type of stuff.,,,

697,0.9128384590148926,4605.8,4608.1,So I've seen a number of things floating around.,,,
698,0.9128384590148926,4608.2,4615.8,So this is what we need to basically this come up with exactly exactly what my thoughts are.,,,
699,0.9128384590148926,4616.0,4619.6,"As you pointed out the council's, been on record since",,,

703,0.8103089332580566,4627.9,4631.5,We also don't want them on the street while they're waiting for housing.,,,
704,0.8103089332580566,4631.5,4636.7,So I think they concern here that has been mentioned by United Way.,,,
705,0.8103089332580566,4636.7,4643.1,"Most recently is to try to find some a large number of beds, particularly for families.",,,
706,0.8103089332580566,4643.1,4647.7,So this is something that will be brought before the console as we go forward.,,,
707,0.6802793145179749,4649.4,4662.2," And I will say that the the committed and homelessness initiative, it get that gets launched to provide some great opportunities for us to really, truly partner and in the area of homeless families, given the percentage of folks that are sitting on.",,,

714,0.7353023290634155,4687.7,4692.7,So I think there's some really great opportunities that we could look at forging in this room.,,,
