49,0.97,242.809,253.72,We talked about the standard of review and scope of recommendations for appeals as noted I provided a memo with some attachments in advance.,12,,
50,0.97,253.72,260.526,I hope attachment number of one is especially helpful.,12,,
51,0.97,260.526,271.104,The number provides a link to each and I hope that will help support the discussion and questions from the members of the committee.,12,,
52,0.97,271.104,277.043,I would like to go through a brief representation.,12,,
53,0.97,277.043,281.147,Instead of saying local improvement district I will say lid or lid.,12,,
54,0.97,281.147,286.786,That's just some jargon to define for the folks that are tuning in.,12,,
55,0.97,286.786,295.461,"Before we begin, normally I don't do this but I'm going to ask for because this is quasi judicial that I get Eric to get through the presentation.",13,,
56,0.97,295.461,299.032,How do you want to do this Eric.,13,,
57,0.97,299.032,306.105,I'm more inclined to let you go through it and then come back or would it interrupt your flow to stop when someone had a question?,13,,
58,0.97,306.105,307.373,I can offer a hybrid.,14,,
59,0.97,307.373,312.345,This sort of clean I think pauses or breaks and the pieces in my presentation it's brief.,14,,
60,0.97,312.345,313.98,So don't worry.,14,,
61,0.97,313.98,319.952,Maybe I can just indicate those pauses and ask if folks have questions at that time.,14,,
62,0.97,319.952,320.219,Okay.,15,,
63,0.97,320.219,320.653,Does that work?,16,,
64,0.97,320.653,323.623,Yeah it does.,17,,
65,0.97,323.623,333.232,"I just have to remind, I know my colleagues know this and so do the legislative assistants but I just want the public to know because this is quasi judicial.",17,,
66,0.97,333.232,338.471,"We don't have the usual robust discussion we would have on other matters, so go ahead.",17,,
67,0.97,338.471,340.073,"Go ahead Eric, thank you.",17,,
68,0.97,340.073,343.242,"Yeah, sure thing.",18,,
69,0.97,343.242,350.85,"Yes, so I took the orientation of the water lid assessment.",18,,
70,0.97,350.85,356.355,Through Ordnance 125750 the final assessment role for the water L.I.,18,,
71,0.97,356.355,361.027,D. the final assessment is the listing of all the properties within the boundaries of the L.I.D.,18,,
72,0.97,361.027,369.369,With the amount to be assessed against each property and that amount is based on the increase in value accruing to each property.,18,,
73,0.97,369.369,371.003,This is called the special benefit.,18,,
74,0.97,371.003,374.974,That you can attribute to the construction of the local improvements.,18,,
75,0.97,374.974,383.349,There always has to be a specific list of the improvements and for the L.I.D.,18,,
76,0.97,383.349,395.194,"Those improvements include the Prominade, the street connection.",18,,
77,0.97,395.194,399.599,The Scape improvements at Pier 58.,18,,
78,0.97,399.599,407.707,There's more attached to the Ordnance 25760.,18,,
79,0.97,407.707,418.284,And the improvements are a component.,18,,
80,0.97,418.284,425.324,"The estimated cost is $347 million however, the waterfront L.I.D.",18,,
81,0.97,425.324,431.931,Assessment is capped by that Ordnance to $160 million plus about $15.5 million in financing cost.,18,,
82,0.97,431.931,440.206,"So it's a total of about 175, $176 million as the cap for the L.I.D.",18,,
83,0.97,440.206,440.506,Assessment.,18,,
84,0.97,440.506,449.849,"City other city funds, state funds in philanthropic sources would round out the entire central waterfront budget.",18,,
85,0.97,449.849,452.218,So that's a break.,18,,
86,0.97,452.218,454.587,I will ask if anyone has any questions.,18,,
87,0.97,454.587,462.128,"The only thing I would add, let me do this quickly.",19,,
88,0.97,462.128,462.395,Sure.,20,,
89,0.97,462.395,466.199,We know the total cost for the L.I.D.,21,,
90,0.97,466.199,467.3,Is 737 million.,21,,
91,0.97,467.3,472.104,"Are you going to talk about, or I can say it as well.",21,,
92,0.97,472.104,478.945,That the number one contributor for the funding is the city is putting in 260 million.,21,,
93,0.97,478.945,482.482,The state is putting in 207 million.,21,,
94,0.97,482.482,484.083,The waterfront L.I.D.,21,,
95,0.97,484.083,494.594,Is 160 million and we have a,21,,
96,0.97,496.929,497.363,Philanthropic.,22,,
97,0.97,497.363,499.098,Philanthropy.,22,,
98,0.97,499.098,499.365,Yes.,23,,
99,0.97,499.365,503.87,I struggle with that word too.,24,,
100,0.97,503.87,506.672,And we're talking about the bucket for the L.I.D.,25,,
101,0.97,506.672,512.345,Would offer and I think it was a verbal slip.,25,,
102,0.97,512.345,518.985,You said for the lid for the very beginning for the over all waterfront program the entire package.,25,,
103,0.97,518.985,521.42,You're right and I apologize.,26,,
104,0.97,521.42,524.59,"No it's okay, I just thought.",27,,
105,0.97,524.59,524.891,Thanks.,28,,
106,0.97,524.891,535.268,Yeah no problem.,29,,
107,0.97,535.268,538.871,"I can, prove right on through or if you have any more questions.",29,,
108,0.97,538.871,543.242,Okay I will move on.,29,,
109,0.97,543.242,554.921,So we are here to hear recommendations and bring the plan to the counsel.,29,,
110,0.97,554.921,568.067,"About 320 property owners of the more than 6,200 properties subject to the L.I.",29,,
111,0.97,568.067,570.236,D. assessment submitted timely hearings.,29,,
112,0.97,570.236,574.307,This is known as the hearing examiners initial report.,29,,
113,0.97,574.307,577.076,That's filed in a clerk file 321780.,29,,
114,0.97,577.076,579.245,Today's hearings are for appeals of that initial report.,29,,
115,0.97,579.245,588.988,"This is a time for the committee to consider the appeals, here Transparently in this hearing.",29,,
116,0.97,588.988,598.998,"On March 6, we will hear appeals from the final report of the hearing Examiner.",29,,
117,0.97,598.998,619.085,"That final report results from the fact that in the initial report there were 17 properties, recommended for Remand.",29,,
118,0.97,619.085,638.337,The Examiner took the final report Incapsulates.,29,,
119,0.97,638.337,642.575,I should add that Council member Herbold has joined us.,30,,
120,0.97,642.575,642.842,Welcome.,30,,
121,0.97,642.842,643.209,Thank you.,31,,
122,0.97,643.209,646.312,If you have any questions I will move right along.,32,,
123,0.97,646.312,653.352,As a reminder the matter of an appeals for an L.I.D.,32,,
124,0.97,653.352,655.755,Is quasi judicial as the chair mentioned.,32,,
125,0.97,655.755,667.466,As a quasi judicial matter the Council members may not have direct or indirect communication with anyone about the areas of a particular appeal outside of a Council hearing or a meeting considering the waterfront L.I.,32,,
126,0.97,667.466,672.738,D. this meeting is all about that.,32,,
127,0.97,672.738,680.613,So the matter of discussion today is about the appeals.,32,,
128,0.97,680.613,698.397,"It's important to talk about the SM D, the review by the Committee on the appeals quote shall be limited to and shall be based solely upon the record from the hearing although the committee may provide oral or written arguments.",32,,
129,0.97,698.397,709.708,"For the hearings before the committee today April 6, no opportunity for additional oral for written argument or comments will be provided.",32,,
130,0.97,709.708,723.456,"Further, the Council quasi judicial rules require that the hearing Examiner's decision shall be afforded substantial weight and the burden of establishing the contrary is upon the appealing party.",32,,
131,0.97,723.456,727.726,Moving right along to the scope of decisions on appeals.,32,,
132,0.97,727.726,750.249,"The revised code of Washington and the Seattle municipal court provide that after hearing all the appeal it is city council may accept the assessment rule as raised, lowered, changed or modify the role or set aside the roll role in order to be made.",32,,
133,0.97,750.249,768.1,Community choices then for recommendations to the Council after hearing the appeal are negative to those actions.,32,,
134,0.97,768.1,776.976,"After the committee considers all the appeal, count central staff, that would be me, will prepare a report for the Council.",32,,
135,0.97,776.976,785.551,There are no committee actions on recommendations of the appeals on today's agenda.,32,,
136,0.97,785.551,786.385,Just briefly.,33,,
137,0.97,786.385,790.556,We started out with I don't remember what the number are.,33,,
138,0.97,790.556,793.959,Then I pulled 17 and we're going to Remand them back.,33,,
139,0.97,793.959,797.997,Now we're at 32 and what are we anticipating for April.,33,,
140,0.97,797.997,802.368,"Yeah, I have some numbers for those.",34,,
141,0.97,802.368,806.672,So the total today the appeals are for the initial report.,34,,
142,0.97,806.672,810.376,There were more appeals from the initial report in April.,34,,
143,0.97,810.376,819.118,In total between today and April 6 is 75 valid appeals on the initial report.,34,,
144,0.97,819.118,823.689,There were 35 valid appeals of the final report that were filed.,34,,
145,0.97,823.689,827.393,However 30 of those amended appeals from the initial report.,34,,
146,0.97,827.393,837.836,So all together in total in terms of actual case FILES for the hearing Examiner is 7 of them.,34,,
147,0.97,837.836,841.841,And the flow of the meeting will happen.,34,,
148,0.97,841.841,850.983,My expectation is the committee will consider those initial appeals together with the amended appeals.,34,,
149,0.97,850.983,853.953,"So, very quickly then, there's 70 appeals total.",34,,
150,0.97,853.953,860.125,And you're dealing with 33 of them today.,34,,
151,0.97,860.125,861.093,"Okay, great.",35,,
152,0.97,861.093,894.159,I hope that was succinct enough.,36,,
153,0.97,894.159,894.393,Yes.,37,,
154,0.97,894.393,905.271,Is there any question from my colleagues to Eric regarding the L.I.D.,37,,
155,0.97,905.271,906.071,And the process.,37,,
156,0.97,906.071,914.48,Hearing no further questions I'm closing the hearing to the appeals by the Examiner on the final assessment role.,37,,
157,0.97,914.48,921.921,For waterfront local improvement district 6751 that are filed in the clerk file number 721893.,37,,
158,0.97,921.921,929.395,"Before we adjourn, let me just share this.",37,,
159,0.97,929.395,940.105,April 6th of this committee as Eric was saying to finish off that final trench of Appeals that adds up to 70.,37,,
160,0.97,940.105,955.421,"And I'm looking and Eric correct me if I'm wrong I think we're looking at may, June to either pass or reject the hearing examiners recommendations.",37,,
161,0.97,955.421,959.124,Yes that's my understanding.,38,,
162,0.97,959.124,961.694,That is the process.,39,,
163,0.97,961.694,968.567,So we will hear you April 6th and we will hear from counsel.,39,,
164,0.97,968.567,971.337,"And hopefully we will have a vote by May, June.",39,,
165,0.97,971.337,974.84,With that is there any other question.,39,,
166,0.97,974.84,978.177,Council member Mosqueda is there anything you want to share.,39,,
167,0.97,978.177,983.582,I can't believe you're all so quiet today.,39,,
168,0.97,983.582,983.782,Okay.,39,,
169,0.97,983.782,983.982,Okay.,39,,
170,0.97,983.982,987.619,"So with that, is there anything else?",39,,
171,0.97,987.619,989.254,"Okay, we stand adjourned.",39,,
