16,0.97,70.904,74.541,"The minutes of the city council meeting of July 13th, 2020 have been reviewed.",5,,

26,0.97,109.075,118.618,"Colleagues, we are now going to begin the first of two public comment periods for items on the introduction referral calendar and the Council's 2020 work program.",5,,
27,0.97,118.618,126.693,This added option is a new approach to public comment to allow additional opportunities or members of the public to participate and share their comments with the Council.,5,,
28,0.97,126.693,130.263,I spoke about these at Council briefing in the morning.,5,,
29,0.97,130.263,134.701,This is the first time we're dividing the remote public comment period at these meetings.,5,,
30,0.97,134.701,151.117,The thought between the two public comment options is to help carve out the space for conversation about Legislations or policies that are or may be introduce today the Council and items that are on our day's agenda for final consideration and action by the full city council.,5,,
31,0.97,151.117,158.124,At this time we're welcoming comments on items on the agenda's introduction referral calendar and the Council's 2020 work program.,5,,
32,0.97,158.124,164.531,"So in other words, items that are not on today's agenda for final action by the Council.",5,,
33,0.97,164.531,169.302,So I'm going to open up that first comment period on the general public comment.,5,,
34,0.97,169.302,177.477,I'd ask that everyone please be patient as we continue to learn how to operate this system in real time.,5,,
35,0.97,177.477,196.296,My hope is that this Bifercation will help and this does intend to have public comment regularly included on our public Agendas.,5,,
36,0.97,196.296,214.447,"However, the city council does reserve the right to end or eliminate or modify these public comment periods at any point if we deem the system is being abused or is no longer suitable for our meetings to be conducted efficiently and in a manner in which we can conduct official business.",5,,
37,0.97,214.447,218.785,I will moderate the public comment period in the following manner.,5,,
38,0.97,218.785,223.69,The public comment period is 20 minutes and each Speaker will be given two minutes to speak.,5,,
39,0.97,223.69,227.193,I'll call on each Speaker to speak.,5,,

41,0.97,238.471,241.741,The public comment link is listed on today's published agenda.,5,,
42,0.97,241.741,251.484,"Once I call a Speaker's name, staff will Unmute the appropriate microphone and an automatic prompt of you have been Unmuted will be the Speaker's Cue that it is their turn to speak.",5,,
43,0.97,251.484,255.555,Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item that you're addressing.,5,,
44,0.97,255.555,265.898,"As a reminder, public comment for this first session should relate to an item on the introduction referral calendar or the city council's 2020 broad work program.",5,,

46,0.97,269.902,284.917,"Once you hear the Chime, we'd ask that you begin to wrap up your public comment and if speakers do not end their comments at the end of the allotted time provided, the Speaker's microphone will be muted to allow us to call on the next Speaker.",5,,
47,0.97,284.917,288.421,"Once you finish your public comment, we ask you please Disconnect from the line.",5,,

157,0.97,953.752,961.627,We did that because the Mayor's budget rebalancing package is unfriendly to say the least.,22,,
158,0.97,961.627,985.017,"The same week the Council supported clean energy by funding home energy Retrofits and jump start, the Mayor took it away by defending municipal building energy efficiency and the Mayor's cut to the Seattle Department of transportation was disproportionately large compared to other departments with the vast majority of these coming from Multi-Modal transportation.",22,,

369,0.97,2107.338,2122.987,I'm sure you're all aware of the racist red lining policies that provided white families in my grandparents' generation--they're in their 80s now--access to home loans while denying families of color at the same time.,54,,
370,0.97,2122.987,2125.79,These policies were obviously wrong and reparation should be made.,54,,

473,0.97,2623.053,2623.554,Hello.,68,,
474,0.97,2623.554,2624.888,My name is Jackie.,68,,
475,0.97,2624.888,2627.224,I live in district 4.,68,,
476,0.97,2627.224,2629.46,I'm a criminal justice professor at Seattle University.,68,,
477,0.97,2629.46,2636.667,I serve on the Seattle police crisis intervention committee and I'm responsible for conducting the annual Seattle public safety survey.,68,,
478,0.97,2636.667,2640.337,I support much of what the defending proponents are calling for.,68,,
479,0.97,2640.337,2645.776,"However, I do not support Defunding SPD by 50%.",68,,
480,0.97,2645.776,2659.823,I'm concerned Defunding SPD without evidence of reforms put in place under the descent decree will have disastrous consequences that will set Seattle back in ways that no one on any side of the issue will want to see.,68,,
481,0.97,2659.823,2660.791,I have two concerns.,68,,
482,0.97,2660.791,2676.473,"The first is the Seattle public survey findings show delayed response to 911, inadequate police staffing, lack of police Followup, too few police in neighborhoods has been one of the top two community concerns for the past five years.",68,,
483,0.97,2676.473,2679.91,"Seattle residents want more, not fewer police.",68,,
484,0.97,2679.91,2685.215,Defunding SPD will result in increased crime and reduced quality of life across Seattle.,68,,
485,0.97,2685.215,2687.651,"Second, SPD has a crisis intervention program.",68,,
486,0.97,2687.651,2704.668,"That's a model for the nation with demonstrated reduction and use of force including officer mental health crisis response teams in place since 2010 and concern that Defunding will disrupt these evidence Bised data driven reforms, leaving us as ground zero, wiping out years of work.",68,,
487,0.97,2704.668,2721.118,"I ask that the Seattle city council recognize Data-Driven, Evidence-Based reform implemented in the Seattle police Department under the descent decree and before, and take into account the disruption the Defunding will have on these reforms.",68,,
488,0.97,2721.118,2724.822,"Crisis calls need police and mental health professionals who work together, not separately.",68,,
489,0.97,2724.822,2728.959,This has been done for many years through SPD crisis intervention.,68,,
490,0.97,2728.959,2735.933,I have serious concerns about what will happen to public safety in Seattle if the Seattle police is Defunded.,68,,
491,0.97,2735.933,2736.667,Thank you.,68,,
492,0.97,2736.667,2741.238,Next up is Joseph.,69,,

497,0.97,2751.782,2759.89,This ordinance disappointments interim regulations while final regulations are developed and formally supersedes the maps originally developed in 1995.,70,,
498,0.97,2759.89,2767.331,The port of Seattle appreciates the Seattle Department of construction inspections maintaining compliance with the national flood insurance program.,70,,
499,0.97,2767.331,2772.536,For clarifying the use of more recent national flood insurance rate maps.,70,,
500,0.97,2772.536,2785.782,The port of Seattle supports adoption of the interim regulations but remains concerned about the application of revised flood plane policies.,70,,
501,0.97,2785.782,2789.353,The interim regulations apply flood plane development standards to more properties than before.,70,,
502,0.97,2789.353,2803.066,"The port of Seattle manages many of these properties and does not oppose flood plane development standards, however, the port does intend to clarify the standards in order to continue providing Wraurt front infrastructure.",70,,
503,0.97,2803.066,2809.006,The port of Seattle looks forward to working with the Seattle Department of construction and inspections as final regulations are developed.,70,,

574,0.97,3098.762,3109.506,My office spends hundreds of hours on the phone with community partners working through the details of the jump start spend plan and the previous proposal to raise revenue.,102,,
575,0.97,3109.506,3130.694,This was built off of tremendous advocacy and organizing efforts and community and among organizations calling for a more progressive proposal to be in front of us so we can address the immediate crisis that's presenting itself because of Covid and the ongoing need for us to invest in housing and support services to create a more equitable economy.,102,,
576,0.97,3130.694,3133.163,I'm really proud of the work we've put together here.,102,,
577,0.97,3133.163,3147.944,"As a Council, as a full Council we have come together and we provided feedback to each other and incorporated information that came directly from communities including from organizations who are led by communities of color.",102,,

581,0.97,3158.822,3175.438,"As you look at this final proposal in front of us, with a detailed spend plan and emergency Covid relief, it has the input from a tremendous amount of individuals and organizations who deliberately Wored with to create the spend plan and the Covid relief.",102,,
582,0.97,3175.438,3181.778,"It invests in promoting health, in creating jobs, in Reigniting our economy in a more equitable way.",102,,
583,0.97,3181.778,3185.715,It includes small businesses and immigrant rights advocates and environmental justice.,102,,
584,0.97,3185.715,3188.385,Those are folks who get credit.,102,,
585,0.97,3188.385,3201.598,"We want to make sure that the folks who have put pressure on from the outside tax Amazon organizers and activists, individuals and community who for years have been calling for Progressive, you all get credit.",102,,

588,0.97,3204.968,3211.608,We worked tremendously hard and in a collaborative way to make history.,102,,
589,0.97,3211.608,3220.116,We're pushing forward a tremendous amount of support for our most vulnerable communities and reinvesting in our local economy because that is what the data says to do.,102,,
590,0.97,3220.116,3229.659,And all cuts budget or austerity approaches in the time of a recession only prolong pain for both local economies and our most vulnerable residents.,102,,
591,0.97,3229.659,3244.674,"So the detailed spend package, the proposal in front of you for immediate Covid relief will help support families, small businesses, and our most vulnerable Becaus you all came together and we pushed this proposal forward with tremendous feedback and input.",102,,
592,0.97,3244.674,3253.583,I actually think having conversations with folks via zoom and calling in options created more opportunity for community partners to provide public testimony.,102,,
593,0.97,3253.583,3256.486,People who were able to call in between shifts.,102,,
594,0.97,3256.486,3261.558,People who were home taking care of loved ones were able to engage in this public policy process.,102,,

598,0.97,3278.808,3280.043,This is what happens.,102,,
599,0.97,3280.043,3291.021,"This is what it looks like to lift up the voices of those shut out by establishment politics of the past who listen to what community needs, who find ways to get to yes.",102,,
600,0.97,3291.021,3301.931,"This is what happens when we have folks in office who don't accept the way things have always been, who aren't going to just give lip service void of action.",102,,
601,0.97,3301.931,3307.304,"Who are smart, collaborative, progressive, and frankly, this Council, we're tired as well.",102,,
602,0.97,3307.304,3315.879,We are tired of being in a declared state of emergency for housing and homelessness for year after year and not seeing more money go into housing.,102,,

604,0.97,3322.519,3338.301,"We're tired of being in a state of Emergenc of homelessness and seeing the number of homeless folks grow year after year, especially in a Covid setting, to be in Non-Congregant settings like the CDC demands.",102,,
605,0.97,3338.301,3348.111,We're tired of being one of the most prosperous cities in the nation while one in four children go without the needed food they need because of food insecurity.,102,,
606,0.97,3348.111,3370.967,And we're tired of the same old rhetoric about the need for austerity and cuts being drummed up on the cusp of a depression when we know cuts only prolong recessions and the tax cuts we've seen imposed in our State and region in the past time of a recession only hurt families and businesses.,102,,
607,0.97,3370.967,3372.135,We need alternatives.,102,,
608,0.97,3372.135,3382.946,And this progressive revenue proposal and the spend plan Covid relief offers create a solution.,102,,
609,0.97,3382.946,3386.783,We're tired of doing everything right but not being able to get ahead.,102,,
610,0.97,3386.783,3394.891,Not being able to keep a roof over their head or food on their table.,102,,
611,0.97,3394.891,3401.865,"In doing everything right, they still see an economy that Prioritizes the few while leaving the many behind.",102,,
612,0.97,3401.865,3405.635,So this is our way to push back.,102,,
613,0.97,3405.635,3415.512,This is our Pushback against status quo politics in the middle of a deadly global pandemic with the highest rates of unemployment and business closures ever.,102,,
614,0.97,3415.512,3420.283,We're doing something that's been proven to invest in our most vulnerable.,102,,
615,0.97,3420.283,3423.72,Spur economic activity and create a more equitable economy.,102,,
616,0.97,3423.72,3427.557,"By passing jump start revenue plan, we're offering relief.",102,,

629,0.97,3519.048,3523.586,We put forward a smart proposal.,102,,

635,0.97,3553.95,3559.789,We do want to hear comments from folks about the bill and the resolution.,103,,
636,0.97,3559.789,3564.961,We do have a couple of amendments that we've got to work through.,103,,
637,0.97,3564.961,3566.963,I'll take those separately.,103,,
638,0.97,3566.963,3583.68,"Before we open it up as we traditionally and typically do to hear comments about the bill, I'm going to go ahead and ask Councilmember Strauss to address amendment 1 as published on the agenda.",103,,
639,0.97,3583.68,3593.523,So I'm going to hand it over to Councilmember Strauss to walk us through his I believe two amendments.,103,,
640,0.97,3593.523,3602.231,Then we will consider that amendment and call the bill--excuse me.,103,,
641,0.97,3602.231,3606.903,Then we'll consider amendment to the resolution.,103,,
642,0.97,3606.903,3614.711,Then we'll have two amended versions of Legislature before us and open it up to general comment.,103,,
643,0.97,3614.711,3616.446,"Councilmember Strauss, you're up first.",103,,
644,0.97,3616.446,3624.587,I'm going to go ahead and hand I over to you to move your amendment 1 and to open up debate for that.,103,,
645,0.97,3624.587,3626.623,"Thank you, Council President.",104,,
646,0.97,3626.623,3630.526,Just double checking to hear what I thought I heard.,104,,
647,0.97,3630.526,3632.729,You'd like me to move the Ãšamendment.,104,,
648,0.97,3632.729,3633.763,Is that correct?,104,,
649,0.97,3633.763,3633.997,Yes.,105,,
650,0.97,3633.997,3635.732,You're not required to.,105,,
651,0.97,3635.732,3640.37,But it is your opportunity to move your amendment if you wish.,105,,
652,0.97,3640.37,3640.937,Wonderful.,106,,
653,0.97,3640.937,3642.071,Thank you so much.,106,,
654,0.97,3642.071,3649.145,I move to amend Council bill 819112 as presented on amendment 1 on this agenda.,106,,
655,0.97,3649.145,3650.947,Is there a second?,107,,
656,0.97,3650.947,3651.648,Second.,108,,
657,0.97,3651.648,3657.887,It's been moved and Seconded to adopt amendment 1.,109,,
658,0.97,3657.887,3662.258,"Councilmember Strauss, you're recognized in order to address the amendment.",109,,
659,0.97,3662.258,3664.16,"Thank you, Council President.",110,,
660,0.97,3664.16,3673.102,"Amendment 1 would increase the small business stabilization Fund, grant fund eligibility to 25Ftes.",110,,
661,0.97,3673.102,3693.823,"Last week I spoke to my colleagues and the public about the need to change the requirements from fixed employees to Ftes, full-time equivalents, to allow for part-time worker to also have the consideration for part-time workers.",110,,
662,0.97,3693.823,3702.732,What I've heard in the interim is the need to increase that threshold to 25 is there and is in our city.,110,,
663,0.97,3702.732,3715.111,This amendment increases eligibility for the small business stabilization grants funded by the bill to include Nonprofits and businesses with up to 25 Ftes as an increase from 10.,110,,
664,0.97,3715.111,3726.089,I've heard a lot of concern about the impacts of Covid on restaurants specifically and the anticipated wave of potential closures that could be coming soon.,110,,
665,0.97,3726.089,3736.766,Resident Restauranteurs from district 6 and across the city have told me 10 Ftes is not high enough for them to capture the support.,110,,
666,0.97,3736.766,3746.542,"While restaurants are a labor intensive industry, it often exceeds 10 Ftes and restaurants oftentimes survive on the narrowest of margins.",110,,
667,0.97,3746.542,3765.194,"In addition to raising the cap on Ftes, this amendment would also add language ensuring that businesses who have already received a grant through prior funding are not eligible for a second grant in adding a geographic equity as a consideration in the distribution of the grant.",110,,
668,0.97,3765.194,3780.943,The reason that the coming around for the second grant is being put in in this amendment is because we do not have enough money in our funds to even serve all of the small businesses that have applied.,110,,
669,0.97,3780.943,3790.753,So want to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to receive funds before people come.,110,,
670,0.97,3790.753,3793.556,"President.My comments, council I appreciate the consideration.",110,,
671,0.97,3793.556,3800.396,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss, for that description of amendment 1.",111,,
672,0.97,3800.396,3803.699,I'm going to go ahead and open it up for debate.,111,,
673,0.97,3803.699,3805.501,I've already received one message.,111,,
674,0.97,3805.501,3811.507,And that is from Councilmember Juarez who would like to make comment.,111,,
675,0.97,3811.507,3820.082,"If anyone else would like to make comment, please signal by raising your hand or sending me a message in the chat box.",111,,
676,0.97,3820.082,3820.55,Councilmember Juarez.,111,,
677,0.97,3820.55,3820.983,Thank you.,112,,
678,0.97,3820.983,3830.059,"I'll be supporting this amendment as with Councilmember Strauss, I've been hearing a lot from small businesses citywide, not just district 5.",112,,
679,0.97,3830.059,3843.139,In particular also from the queer community on Capitol Hill and their small businesses that it simply would not work and especially wipe many of them out if we did not do an increase from 10 FTE to 25.,112,,
680,0.97,3843.139,3850.112,"And I think I don't need to go into all the detail, where we're at with this recession, small businesses and Covid.",112,,
681,0.97,3850.112,3860.923,"But my point is in order to at least to some degree keep some of these businesses open who are barely hanging on, I'll be supporting this amendment.",112,,
682,0.97,3860.923,3861.19,Thank you.,112,,
683,0.97,3861.19,3865.461,Thank you.,113,,
684,0.97,3865.461,3867.096,Councilmember Morales.,113,,
685,0.97,3867.096,3872.635,"Thank you, Council President.",114,,
686,0.97,3872.635,3877.64,I will say that I am struggling with this amendment.,114,,
687,0.97,3877.64,3898.661,"I know that we have--we just included language in our green new deal and our equitable development, language in the earlier part of the progressive revenue package that really highlights the greater disparities that we have in some neighborhoods.",114,,
688,0.97,3898.661,3905.868,We funded Edi because of the history of red lining that's left greater disparities among South end neighborhoods.,114,,
689,0.97,3905.868,3927.49,Struggling a little bit because I completely understand the need to support small businesses across the city and I know we want to make sure that every neighborhood--that the businesses in every neighborhood commercial district get access to technical assistance and operational support that can help them.,114,,
690,0.97,3927.49,3937.7,"So I also understand that as a former restaurant worker myself, that many businesses have lots of part-time employees.",114,,
691,0.97,3937.7,3941.337,So I understand increasing to 25 Ftes.,114,,
692,0.97,3941.337,3948.811,"I guess what I would say is if we want to adjust the crisis so Emore businesses are eligible, that's one conversation.",114,,
693,0.97,3948.811,3955.785,But we know that businesses who receive funding already in the first round were predominantly people of color.,114,,
694,0.97,3955.785,3970.366,"And from my perspective, this amendment would eliminate the opportunity for future funding for small businesses owned by immigrants and people of color and just sort of perpetuating the generational wealth gap.",114,,
695,0.97,3970.366,3981.744,"So I am not going to support this amendment, and I will say I fully support amendment 2 being offered by Councilmember Strauss but I can't support amendment 1.",114,,
696,0.97,3981.744,3989.251,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Morales.",115,,
697,0.97,3989.251,3989.719,Councilmember Herbold.,115,,
698,0.97,3989.719,3991.153,I'm off mute.,116,,
699,0.97,3991.153,3995.424,I have a question.,116,,
700,0.97,3995.424,4030.559,"I heard loud and clear from Oed when they started this small business stabilization fund that their narrowing of the eligibility to five employees was their best way of ensuring that eligibility was narrowly focused on using an equity lens, focused on low and moderate income, business owners in communities of color.",116,,
701,0.97,4030.559,4041.804,"In that increasing the number of employees for businesses, it makes it a little bit more difficult for Oed to make decisions with that kind of equity lens.",116,,
702,0.97,4041.804,4053.115,And we've already agreed to increase the eligibility from five to ten employees for eligibility.,116,,
703,0.97,4053.115,4071.734,"So I just want to see if the sponsor, Councilmember Strauss has any information related to specifically the number of eligible businesses with this increase to 25.",116,,
704,0.97,4071.734,4093.689,"My understanding is Oed received 5,500 eligible applications for the first round of funding which was only available at that point to businesses with five or fewer employees and even though 5,500 eligible applications were received, they were only able to make 250 grants.",116,,
705,0.97,4093.689,4100.496,"I'm just wondering, do we have estimates of the number of businesses that would be eligible?",116,,
706,0.97,4100.496,4108.07,And the number of grants that would be possible to make with these new funds if we increase the eligibility to 25.,116,,
707,0.97,4108.07,4108.637,Councilmember Strauss.,117,,
708,0.97,4108.637,4111.841,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",118,,
709,0.97,4111.841,4112.842,I do have that information.,118,,
710,0.97,4112.842,4115.811,I don't have it at the tip of my fingertips.,118,,
711,0.97,4115.811,4119.348,Let me see if I can't find it and send you an Email right now.,118,,
712,0.97,4119.348,4126.155,I know you're correct this would enlarge the pool of eligible businesses to a great degree.,118,,
713,0.97,4126.155,4139.068,Which is also why I brought the other two elements to this amendment about not being funded a second time and a distribution across the city.,118,,
714,0.97,4139.068,4150.779,"I will raise there's even with that distribution across the city, there's still going to be a focus on equity versus just spreading peanut butter across a number of different businesses.",118,,
715,0.97,4150.779,4161.157,So let me try and find that Email about the level of number of businesses would be able to receive this funding.,118,,
716,0.97,4161.157,4169.365,"Colleagues, are there any other questions or comments on amendment 1?",119,,
717,0.97,4169.365,4172.568,I'm not seeing any.,119,,
718,0.97,4172.568,4177.373,"Colleagues, I, like Councilmember Morales, am also struggling with this amendment.",119,,
719,0.97,4177.373,4184.446,I did oppose it in a version of it in committee last week.,119,,
720,0.97,4184.446,4188.217,My position has not changed.,119,,
721,0.97,4188.217,4198.627,I think that the questions by Councilmember Herbold are my primary concern about increasing the FTE amount.,119,,
722,0.97,4198.627,4205.601,It's important for us--and I worked with Councilmember Strauss on increasing it from 5 to 10.,119,,
723,0.97,4205.601,4218.814,"That was worth it, we did a partnership to Modulate where we're setting the line for the size of the small business.",119,,
724,0.97,4218.814,4220.849,I thought five was probably too small.,119,,
725,0.97,4220.849,4231.493,10 seemed a little more appropriate to really target in on the mom and pop mainstream shops that we really are hoping to be able to provide assistance to.,119,,
726,0.97,4231.493,4242.905,My concern with opening it to up to 25 Ftes is it seems to be a pretty aggressive pendulum swing in the opposite direction.,119,,
727,0.97,4242.905,4258.687,"And 25Ftes could be up to 50 employees or maybe even more and I worry that when we start getting into that number, that volume of employees that we're no longer talking about a small business in the way we intend.",119,,
728,0.97,4258.687,4265.027,So for that reason I'm going to continue to oppose this particular amendment.,119,,
729,0.97,4265.027,4270.566,Certainly appreciate the spirit and intent with which it was brought forward.,119,,
730,0.97,4270.566,4286.081,"But those issues have Unfortunately not been resolved for me from my perspective and the feedback I've heard from some small business owners, particularly those small businesses who are owned by folks of color and/or immigrants and refugees.",119,,
731,0.97,4286.081,4289.585,"So with that being said, it sounds like we're ready to take a vote here.",119,,
732,0.97,4289.585,4292.921,"So I'm going to ask--Oh, I'm sorry.",119,,
733,0.97,4292.921,4293.522,"Councilmember Strauss, please.",119,,
734,0.97,4293.522,4297.593,"Just wanted to highlight--thank you, Council President.",120,,
735,0.97,4297.593,4303.832,Just wanted to highlight we did work in partnership to make the initial change and I appreciated being able to work with you on that.,120,,
736,0.97,4303.832,4304.466,Just saying thanks.,120,,
737,0.97,4304.466,4307.403,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",121,,
738,0.97,4307.403,4310.105,I always appreciate working with you as well.,121,,
739,0.97,4310.105,4320.349,"With that being said, let's go ahead and have the clerk recall the roll on the passage of amendment 1.",121,,

760,0.97,4368.597,4370.966,The motion carries.,141,,
761,0.97,4370.966,4373.669,Amendment 1 is adopted.,141,,
762,0.97,4373.669,4375.537,Are there any--I'm sorry.,141,,
763,0.97,4375.537,4385.514,"Before I open it up for general debate, I understand there's a second amendment also brought forward by Councilmember Strauss.",141,,
764,0.97,4385.514,4391.687,"I'm going to recognize you, Councilmember Strauss, in order for you to move amendment.",141,,
765,0.97,4391.687,4396.358,"Thank you, Council President.",142,,
766,0.97,4396.358,4396.792,Sorry.,142,,
767,0.97,4396.792,4400.062,I'm having some technical difficulties with these screens.,142,,
768,0.97,4400.062,4406.301,"Thank you for your time and thank you for the consideration, colleagues, on my amendments.",142,,
769,0.97,4406.301,4412.207,I move to amend Council bill 819112 as presented on the agenda.,142,,
770,0.97,4412.207,4413.408,Is there a second?,143,,
771,0.97,4413.542,4414.109,Second.,144,,
772,0.97,4414.109,4418.18,It's been moved and Seconded.,145,,
773,0.97,4418.18,4422.851,"Councilmember Strauss, I'm going to recognize you in order to address amendment 2.",145,,
774,0.97,4422.851,4438.7,"Councilmember Gonzalez, if you don't mind, there's a recently distributed version 2 of amendment 2 that I wanted to make sure was in front of the city council before Councilmember Strauss addressed amendment 2.",146,,
775,0.97,4438.7,4441.537,You're saying I need to suspend the rules?,147,,
776,0.97,4441.537,4444.139,It's only a correction.,148,,
777,0.97,4444.139,4453.382,"It does not change the effect of the amendment, it just corrects some technical numbers in the amendment so it's all aligned.",148,,
778,0.97,4453.382,4462.257,"And 2ND base Strauss Councilmember Strauss, if you wouldn't mind.",148,,
779,0.97,4462.257,4480.375,"So we don't need to amend the motion language that was just made by Councilmember Strauss, you just need him to for the record address what the changes are to the most recently distributed version of amendment 2?",149,,
780,0.97,4480.375,4480.876,Correct.,150,,
781,0.97,4480.876,4481.977,Okay.,151,,
782,0.97,4481.977,4488.55,"So the bill--excuse me, the amendment has been moved and Seconded.",151,,
783,0.97,4488.55,4495.724,"So Councilmember Strauss, again, I'm going to ask you to address amendment 2 as it was recently circulated.",151,,
784,0.97,4495.724,4512.007,"In doing so, if you could explain for the record what the difference is between the published version of amendment 2 and the recently circulated version of amendment 2 that would be required per our city clerk.",151,,
785,0.97,4512.007,4513.575,"Thank you, Council President.",152,,
786,0.97,4513.575,4539.034,The changes between what was attached to the agenda and what was distributed is simply--the updated amendment is simply an omission to Oed's funding increase in section 4 as reflected in the table and collects the table line number to the column to reflect the added Oed funding increase.,152,,
787,0.97,4539.034,4542.037,Thank you so much.,153,,
788,0.97,4542.037,4547.943,Would you like to make any other remarks or comments about amendment 2?,153,,
789,0.97,4547.943,4548.644,Yes.,154,,
790,0.97,4548.644,4549.711,"Thank you, Council President.",154,,
791,0.97,4549.711,4554.55,This amendment would add $4.7 million to the funding for small businesses support.,154,,
792,0.97,4554.55,4576.338,"I came to this number because it would bring the total funding for small businesses support to 25% of the 2020 jump start expenditures, a request I've heard from small businesses, and despite what some have said today, this does not run down our rainy day or emergency funds to complete.",154,,
793,0.97,4576.338,4580.375,450 more small businesses in our communities will receive grants.,154,,
794,0.97,4580.375,4583.679,That may be the difference between weathering this pandemic or closing down for good.,154,,
795,0.97,4583.679,4594.69,I recognize there's a concern with spending additional dollars Otof the revenue stabilization fund which is why this amendment is about half the size of the previous amendment that I brought last week.,154,,
796,0.97,4594.69,4605.467,"As with the other 2020 expenditures, if this amendment passes, I'll be bringing an amendment to resolution 31957 to replenish the fund in 2021.",154,,
797,0.97,4605.467,4612.541,"We know when small businesses stay open and keep employees, more people are able to spend money in our economy.",154,,
798,0.97,4612.541,4622.184,"This is exactly how the importance of the middle class when the middle class has the dollars to spend in the economy, it keeps activity moving.",154,,
799,0.97,4622.184,4629.558,More taxes are collected as these businesses stay open.,154,,
800,0.97,4629.558,4633.261,Allow us to scale our response to the stimulus package.,154,,
801,0.97,4633.261,4633.895,"Thank you, Council President.",154,,
802,0.97,4633.895,4635.998,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",155,,
803,0.97,4635.998,4639.935,"Are there any comments or questions, Councilmember Lewis?",155,,
804,0.97,4639.935,4642.738,"Thank you, Madam President.",156,,
805,0.97,4642.738,4647.943,I want to thank Councilmember Strauss for bringing this forward as I did last week.,156,,
806,0.97,4647.943,4663.959,I think it is important that we talk about what we can do for the small businesses that are struggling throughout the crisis and really trying to make ends meet under really unique and extreme pressures.,156,,
807,0.97,4663.959,4706.268,"I think given the amount of borrowing that we're doing from our emergency reserves, I'm not in a position where I'm going to vote to dig even deeper into the remaining amount of slack we've kept into these Reserve funds just given all of the other spending that we're committing to and knowing that next year we are going to have to rely on these reserves for a potential additional round of balancing and that preserving what slack we do currently have in here is something that I want to make sure that we maintain a commitment to and not dig any deeper.",156,,
808,0.97,4706.268,4723.919,The other thing I would site is it does look like we are going to get another round of community development block grant money in the near term or at least the executive seems to be optimistic that we're going to get another round of community development block grant money.,156,,
809,0.97,4723.919,4729.758,Those funds have formed the core of our direct relief to small businesses.,156,,
810,0.97,4729.758,4735.063,So we have that potentially to look forward to to come into this space.,156,,
811,0.97,4735.063,4750.078,I do think that part of our fall project in looking at the 2021 budget should include some discussion around some kind of tax relief.,156,,
812,0.97,4750.078,4752.647,I know Councilmember Strauss has been a leader on that.,156,,
813,0.97,4752.647,4762.958,I think that those are the things that I would prefer to focus on rather than continuing to draw down from our reserve funds.,156,,
814,0.97,4762.958,4764.96,So I'm going to respectfully vote against it.,156,,
815,0.97,4764.96,4766.862,It's hard to vote against it.,156,,
816,0.97,4766.862,4780.809,"But I do think based on how much we are currently spending, borrowing to be more accurate from our reserve funds, maintaining the small amount of slack that we do have is an important priority.",156,,
817,0.97,4780.809,4782.778,So for that reason I'll be voting no.,156,,
818,0.97,4782.778,4785.013,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",157,,
819,0.97,4785.013,4790.519,Any other questions or comments?,157,,
820,0.97,4790.519,4792.12,Councilmember Pedersen followed by Councilmember Mosqueda.,157,,
821,0.97,4792.12,4793.989,"Thank you, Council President.",158,,
822,0.97,4793.989,4797.159,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss, for advancing this.",158,,
823,0.97,4797.159,4799.961,I was happy to support the previous amendment.,158,,
824,0.97,4799.961,4802.063,I do have concerns with this.,158,,
825,0.97,4802.063,4815.677,We did receive correspondence from deputy Mayor Mike Fong noticing the executive's concern with spending more of the revenue stabilization Fund and zeroing out the emergency Fund.,158,,
826,0.97,4815.677,4823.785,"I do support the bill as a whole and intend to vote for the bill as a whole but to do more at this time, I have Concers.",158,,
827,0.97,4823.785,4825.887,So just wanted to explain that.,158,,
828,0.97,4825.887,4826.354,Thank you.,158,,
829,0.97,4826.354,4830.826,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",159,,
830,0.97,4830.826,4831.326,Councilmember Mosqueda.,159,,
831,0.97,4831.326,4834.229,"Thank you, Madam President.",160,,
832,0.97,4834.229,4838.934,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss, for bringing this forward.",160,,
833,0.97,4838.934,4841.102,I did support the previous amendment.,160,,
834,0.97,4841.102,4842.804,I am not going to be supporting this one.,160,,
835,0.97,4842.804,4849.477,"I want to push back on the false narrative out there that somehow we're moving all of the emergency reserves, which is not true in the underlying bill.",160,,
836,0.97,4849.477,4855.483,"And in fact, it wouldn't be true with your amendment even if it were to hang, there would still be reserves there.",160,,
837,0.97,4855.483,4867.629,"In line with the initial crafting of the bill and what other Councilmembers have said, I think we're intentionally leaving a reasonable amount of funding in the emergency funds for the next year if needed.",160,,
838,0.97,4867.629,4869.297,I will not be supporting this.,160,,
839,0.97,4869.297,4872.934,I do appreciate you bringing it forward.,160,,
840,0.97,4872.934,4877.706,I hope this offers clarification on the misinformation put out about the emergency reserves.,160,,
841,0.97,4877.706,4885.413,Also more about this later but I think this whole conversation really underscores the importance of us having these rainy day funds and emergency reserves.,160,,
842,0.97,4885.413,4888.016,"If ever there was a time to use them, it is now.",160,,
843,0.97,4888.016,4891.519,So I think we have done that in a responsible way.,160,,
844,0.97,4891.519,4892.854,With the underlying bill.,160,,
845,0.97,4892.854,4894.89,I appreciate where you're coming from.,160,,
846,0.97,4894.89,4905.6,"Sadly, I'll be a no on this today but really appreciate your work on this and look forward to working with you to support small businesses as we move forward with implementation of getting these dollars out the door.",160,,
847,0.97,4905.6,4907.335,Thank you for those comments.,161,,
848,0.97,4907.335,4910.472,"As usual, the sponsor of the amendment will have the last word.",161,,
849,0.97,4910.472,4917.045,Are there any other Councilmembers who have any other comments or questions on amendment 2?,161,,
850,0.97,4917.045,4917.712,"Oh, Councilmember Pedersen.",161,,
851,0.97,4917.712,4922.45,I just wanted to clarify my earlier comments.,162,,
852,0.97,4922.45,4927.389,"So there would be the two funds, emergency Fund and revenue stabilization fund.",162,,
853,0.97,4927.389,4934.262,And I guess there is money left over from the combined funds.,162,,
854,0.97,4934.262,4935.53,I acknowledge that.,162,,
855,0.97,4935.53,4941.102,Technically I think we are draining down the emergency fund but the revenue stabilization will have some money left over.,162,,
856,0.97,4941.102,4942.237,I just wanted to clarify.,162,,
857,0.97,4942.237,4948.109,I wanted to clarify that I was specifically talking about the one Fund.,162,,
858,0.97,4948.109,4954.249,There's the other fund that will have money left over whether we pass Councilmember Strauss's amendment or not.,162,,
859,0.97,4954.249,4958.353,Thank you for letting me clarify that.,162,,
860,0.97,4958.353,4958.72,Absolutely.,163,,
861,0.97,4958.72,4967.195,Any other comments or questions on amendment 2?,163,,
862,0.97,4967.195,4969.23,I'm sort of scanning.,163,,
863,0.97,4969.23,4973.034,Look like no other Councilmembers have a comment here.,163,,
864,0.97,4973.034,4974.369,"Councilmember Strauss, you have the final word.",163,,
865,0.97,4974.369,4980.041,"Thank you, Council president and colleagues for your consideration.",164,,
866,0.97,4980.041,4985.58,"Just again, restating to combat the false narrative that's out there.",164,,
867,0.97,4985.58,4995.623,With or without this amendment we would not be spending all the rainy day funds which has been described by some at the city government over the last couple hours.,164,,
868,0.97,4995.623,5015.443,"With or without this amendment, city council is not fully Utillizing all of our capacity to fight a pandemic and an economic recession with dollars that have been saved over past years to fight such recessions in unforeseen emergencies.",164,,
869,0.97,5015.443,5016.044,"Thank you, Council President.",164,,
870,0.97,5016.044,5020.115,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",165,,
871,0.97,5020.115,5020.482,Appreciate that.,165,,
872,0.97,5020.482,5023.752,"Colleagues, I'm going to go ahead and close out debate on amendment 2.",165,,
873,0.97,5023.752,5030.992,I'd ask that the clerk please call the role on the adoption of amendment 2 as recently circulated.,165,,

897,0.97,5081.309,5084.112,Thank you so much.,186,,
898,0.97,5084.112,5086.581,The motion fails.,186,,
899,0.97,5086.581,5093.221,Amendment 2 is not adopted.,186,,
900,0.97,5093.221,5098.359,Are there any other further comments on the bill as amended?,186,,
901,0.97,5098.359,5102.73,"Councilmember Mosqueda, did you want to have the final word or did you want to speak now?",186,,
902,0.97,5102.73,5105.3,Sure.,187,,
903,0.97,5105.3,5116.911,"Clarification maybe for the viewing public on a potential amendment I was thinking about and not going to walk on related to tiny House villages, if now is a good time to clarify that, Madam President.",187,,
904,0.97,5116.911,5121.816,That's an amendment to the Council bill as opposed to the resolution?,188,,
905,0.97,5121.816,5122.917,Yeah.,189,,
906,0.97,5122.917,5126.988,That's correct.,189,,
907,0.97,5126.988,5127.222,Okay.,190,,
908,0.97,5127.222,5143.338,Let me go ahead and recognize you in order to address what could have been an amendment but isn't an amendment and then we'll take comments on the bill as a whole as amended from other colleagues.,190,,
909,0.97,5143.338,5143.838,Councilmember Mosqueda.,190,,
910,0.97,5143.838,5144.172,Wonderful.,191,,
911,0.97,5144.172,5153.181,There was some conversation last Wednesday about the amendment related to tiny House villages and Noncongregant settings.,191,,
912,0.97,5153.181,5166.261,While I voted to retain the flexibility with regards to Noncongregant spending so it could be used for hotels and motels.,191,,
913,0.97,5166.261,5185.18,I was thinking about offering clarifying language because we know how important it is for all Noncongregant settings to have the support they need for addressing the current Covid crisis like addressing the ongoing shared bathrooms and food areas or eating spaces.,191,,
914,0.97,5185.18,5195.423,I'm really conscious though of the fact that tiny House villages along with hotels and motels are a much better alternative to existing Congregant settings.,191,,
915,0.97,5195.423,5205.333,We were thinking about bringing forward an amendment to clarify those pieces for the viewing audience and folks who did testify today.,191,,
916,0.97,5205.333,5209.404,So the $3.6 million is specifically allocated for tiny House villages.,191,,
917,0.97,5209.404,5224.285,"I think to the degree we can get those villages stood up in quick time and that offers relief to folks Currenty in Congregant settings or outside in the elements to have a room, a roof, and a secure place to live.",191,,
918,0.97,5224.285,5226.387,Obviously that's a much better location.,191,,
919,0.97,5226.387,5232.86,"We really want the Mayor, the executive team to spend those dollars.",191,,
920,0.97,5232.86,5242.136,I'm sure we'll be following up with all the advocates from the housing advocates to make sure the money gets out the door.,191,,
921,0.97,5242.136,5248.509,I'm not going to be bringing forward a clarifying amendment today and the amendment stays within the bill.,191,,
922,0.97,5248.509,5251.846,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",192,,
923,0.97,5251.846,5259.187,Are there any comments on the bill as amended?,192,,
924,0.97,5259.187,5259.721,Councilmember Herbold.,192,,
925,0.97,5259.721,5259.954,Please.,192,,
926,0.97,5259.954,5260.488,Then Councilmember Sawant.,192,,
927,0.97,5260.488,5271.733,So thank you for the opportunity to provide some closing comments on this really critical action that we're about to take.,193,,
928,0.97,5271.733,5286.347,This is necessary and crucial support to limit the damage being done by this public health emergency and ensure they have the support they need to survive right now.,193,,
929,0.97,5286.347,5296.557,We've learned from the past that engaging in austerity budgeting and slashing programs only leads to a prolonged struggle to recover.,193,,
930,0.97,5296.557,5298.793,"Both for individual businesses, and individual households.",193,,
931,0.97,5298.793,5301.496,And for our economy as a whole.,193,,
932,0.97,5301.496,5306.601,This for me is the lesson of the great recession.,193,,
933,0.97,5306.601,5335.296,"The legislation takes to heart and makes targeted investments where they can do the most good, focusing on small business owners that make our city a special place to live and are operating under significant uncertainty in providing jobs to people in our community and Nonprofits that are working tirelessly to care for the people most impacted by Covid and also providing essential jobs.",193,,
934,0.97,5335.296,5358.119,"In immigrant and refugee communities who are shut out by other forms of relief, and for people who are struggling to pay their rent and those who are attempting to survive unsheltered, as well as for those who rely on rent to pay their bills.",193,,
935,0.97,5358.119,5373.901,"Finally, as it relates to very, very critical food relief, this bill puts a premium on helping households who are struggling to put enough food on the table and whose meal programs have been otherwise shut down.",193,,
936,0.97,5373.901,5401.429,"Again, I really appreciate that this has been so targeted for our investments throughout the end of 2020 and appreciate the opportunity and the privilege to work with Councilmembers as well as the broader spending plan.",193,,
937,0.97,5401.429,5402.096,Thank you.,193,,
938,0.97,5402.096,5409.937,"Thank you, Councilmember her bold for those remarks.",194,,
939,0.97,5409.937,5413.274,We'll hear from Councilmember Sawant and then Councilmember Lewis.,194,,
940,0.97,5413.274,5413.608,Thank you.,195,,
941,0.97,5413.608,5427.455,Today's vote by the Seattle city council along with the historic Amazon tax victory earlier this month represents the culmination of three years of determined grassroots rank and file organizing.,195,,
942,0.97,5427.455,5447.175,"Our movement has forced the city establishment to dedicate at least $18 million per year from the Amazon tax revenues for publicly owned, permanently affordable housing for black working class and poor families in the central district, and has dedicated funds for the green new deal and tiny House villages.",195,,
943,0.97,5447.175,5455.449,Our movement has won because we overcame the opposition of big establishment who have fought us every step of the way.,195,,
944,0.97,5455.449,5457.018,Make no mistake about it.,195,,
945,0.97,5457.018,5499.861,"The Amazon tax and today's Fund for black community housing in the central district are not the result of political Quote/Unquote collaboration with big business but rather a product of a working class movement led by socialists, by workers, by unions, and by Blm activists, activists because of who won the ban on chemical weapons by police, and we now see Mayor Durkin attempting to undermine that legislation and also doubling down on her lawyer representation of big business interest by refusing to sign the Amazon tax that has been approved by the majority of the Council.",195,,
946,0.97,5499.861,5503.798,"Hundreds of voters, volunteers have joined this truly grassroots movement.",195,,
947,0.97,5503.798,5509.27,We held four action conferences.,195,,
948,0.97,5509.27,5509.871,We organize protests.,195,,
949,0.97,5509.871,5516.277,We organized a car caravan with social distancing during the pandemic.,195,,
950,0.97,5516.277,5525.119,We marched in Olympia when they attempted to pass Legislature banning our city from taxing big business.,195,,
951,0.97,5525.119,5525.686,Progressive organizations.,195,,
952,0.97,5525.686,5542.003,"And we most importantly, we launched a tax Amazon ballot initiative to represent concrete and material threat to big business which was operating in the back rooms to undermine the Amazon tax legislation in the city council.",195,,
953,0.97,5542.003,5551.178,"And in fact, on the streets as part of the justice for George Floyd movement, we gathered 30,000 signatures.",195,,
954,0.97,5551.178,5555.516,"The first 20,000 in just the first 20 days of the protests.",195,,
955,0.97,5555.516,5563.557,Big businesses themselves have admitted that they were forced to concede to the tax Amazon and black lives matter movement.,195,,
956,0.97,5563.557,5575.436,"As Steve Hooper of a company that viciously opposed the Amazon tax and $15 minimum wage said, quote, our industry would have been disproportionately hammered by the Sawant-Morales proposal.",195,,
957,0.97,5575.436,5584.845,I was trying to protect our industry for sure from the complete proposal I thought was incredibly harmful.,195,,
958,0.97,5584.845,5585.846,Unquote.,195,,
959,0.97,5585.846,5605.099,"These quotes and the quote by former Mayor Ed Murray in which he admitted that it was the 15 now ballot initiative and he said it has the potential of passing, incredibly detrimental to our restaurants and small businesses.",195,,
960,0.97,5605.099,5605.333,Unquote.,195,,
961,0.97,5605.333,5622.383,These are quotes from big business representatives and they remind us that the interest of the super wealthy and working people and the poor are diametrically opposed to each other.,195,,
962,0.97,5622.383,5631.359,The big business and wealthy interest consider it harmful to them even though they have massive cash reserves and the overwhelming wealth of our society.,195,,
963,0.97,5631.359,5635.062,"Even those, the majority that goes to work and creates that wealth.",195,,
964,0.97,5635.062,5640.668,That's why it requires a political struggle to win victories for the majority.,195,,
965,0.97,5640.668,5661.322,"The political establishment, corporate media, and others are fighting to make people believe that the progressive change, changes like Amazon tax, come from sitting down at a table with someone like Steve Hooper to come to a happy compromise but in real life, the compromises we see are a reflection of the balance of power in society.",195,,
966,0.97,5661.322,5675.302,"So if working people understand this is about power, then we can win greater gains in the future because we will focus the strategy of our movement on building worker power and empower the marginalized and the oppressed.",195,,
967,0.97,5675.302,5682.91,Not to mention the Renters who are now going to be facing a tsunami of Evictions as soon as moratoriums are lifted.,195,,
968,0.97,5682.91,5700.061,"If, on the other hand, the establishment seeds in convincing people to put their faith in collaboration with big business, it will end up building the political power of big business even further and make future victories for working people and people of color far less likely.",195,,
969,0.97,5700.061,5726.32,I'm thrilled to be able to vote yes today on the ordinance and the resolution in order to make available tens of millions to fund emergency Covid relief for our communities and the potential to build affordable housing for black and Brown communities in the central district and other parts of the city and funding the green new deal and immediately establishing five new tiny House villages.,195,,
970,0.97,5726.32,5730.591,All of this has been hard fought and hard won.,195,,
971,0.97,5730.591,5736.363,We will need similarly emboldened movement to win in the next three weeks.,195,,
972,0.97,5736.363,5740.134,It will be on the budget for the remainder of 2020.,195,,
973,0.97,5740.134,5753.047,"For those who may have participated with the people's budget campaign every year, the last years, we'll be voting on the fall budget in the fall of 2020 for the budget of next year.",195,,
974,0.97,5753.047,5761.622,So let's make sure we immediately gear up for winning the victories we want to win in the people's budget summer 2020 campaign.,195,,
975,0.97,5761.622,5777.304,We're demanding the police Department be Defunded by at least 50% which means Defunding them by at least $85 million for the rest of this year and Demaengd that those funds be transferred into socially constructive causes in the black and Brown community.,195,,
976,0.97,5777.304,5787.148,And to make sure that the city stops doing ineffective Sweeps of homeless neighbors and to fund Renter organizing.,195,,
977,0.97,5787.148,5795.789,"So I invite everybody who's watching this to the people's budget summer 2020 rally and March on Tuesday, July 28th, at 6:00 P.M.",195,,
978,0.97,5795.789,5797.391,At Seattle central college.,195,,
979,0.97,5797.391,5797.658,Thank you.,195,,
980,0.97,5797.658,5800.661,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",196,,
981,0.97,5800.661,5804.465,We will now hear from Councilmember Lewis.,196,,
982,0.97,5804.465,5806.5,"Thank you, Madam President.",197,,
983,0.97,5806.5,5812.806,I'll be brief so we can get to the final question here on voting on this today.,197,,
984,0.97,5812.806,5859.22,"But I did just want to briefly say that I'm really excited that we're taking this big move as a Council to really make strong, noticeable, and meaningful progress on what was our original state of emergency this year, the massive crisis of so many of our neighbors living on the streets in a state of homelessness, sleeping in vehicles, sleeping in tents, and making sure we as a city are acting with a sense of urgency that that demands and making sure that there's meaningful progress, that all of us in Seattle want to see regardless of our position.",197,,
985,0.97,5859.22,5872.199,We all have that same interest which is to get folks who are living unsheltered inside where they can live with dignity and have support that they need.,197,,
986,0.97,5872.199,5888.249,There are several measures in this plan that we're passing today that will provide that immediate relief and partnership with providers and with our neighbors in how we shaped this over the last several months.,197,,
987,0.97,5888.249,5900.861,Really proud to have worked with the sponsors and other members of this Council and with Councilmember Morales on the amendment regarding the tiny House villages and among other investments we've made.,197,,
988,0.97,5900.861,5920.948,"And Councilmember Mosqueda, your leadership in making sure this was at the forefront of your mind in drafting this relief to really respond to the massive amount of tents on our street with folks in them with nowhere to go.",197,,
989,0.97,5920.948,5931.592,"Honestly without having those outputs from doing outreach, not making meaningful progress throughout the spring and early summer.",197,,
990,0.97,5931.592,5933.193,I'm glad we're finally doing that.,197,,
991,0.97,5933.193,5947.474,I'm glad we can go back to our constituents and say we're taking action urgently to have movement on this in 2020 and hopefully the beginning of even more to come throughout the rest of the plan.,197,,
992,0.97,5947.474,5948.242,Thank you so much.,197,,
993,0.97,5948.242,5952.146,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",198,,
994,0.97,5952.146,5958.152,Are there any additional comments on the bill as amended?,198,,
995,0.97,5958.152,5962.723,Looks like there are no additional comments from other colleagues.,198,,
996,0.97,5962.723,5973.2,I also want to say thanks to Councilmember Mosqueda and her staff for all of the work you all have done to get us to this point.,198,,
997,0.97,5973.2,5979.707,Obviously last week was a momentous occasion or couple weeks ago was a momentous occasion.,198,,
998,0.97,5979.707,6014.608,"This is another opportunity for us to, again, Prioritize those areas of funding that we think are critical in the city's effort to recover from the economic crisis caused by this pandemic and appreciate the opportunity to continue to be supportive of taking local action where we have not seen action from our state Legislature or from our region in terms of addressing the progressive nature of our tax system.",198,,
999,0.97,6014.608,6039.199,I do appreciate your ongoing effort to make sure that we have an opportunity to ask the wealthiest corporations to pay their fair share and to give the Council an opportunity to clearly articulate where it is we want to see Prioritization of Expenedtures.,198,,
1000,0.97,6039.199,6042.536,It's my hope the executive will spend these dollars.,198,,
1001,0.97,6042.536,6047.107,"We cannot force the executive, the Mayor, to actually spend any dollars at all.",198,,
1002,0.97,6047.107,6071.231,But it is my hope that we'll choose to spend the dollars as opposed to allowing folks to not reap the benefits of the appropriation choices the city council is about to make today by passage of both this Council bill and the upcoming resolution.,198,,
1003,0.97,6071.231,6074.101,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda, for your leadership on this.",198,,
1004,0.97,6074.101,6078.572,I know there's much more to come through our ongoing budget deliberations.,198,,
1005,0.97,6078.572,6089.55,"With that, I'm going to hand it over to you to close out debate on this Council bill and the resolution so we can take a final vote and consider the last pieces of the resolution.",198,,
1006,0.97,6089.55,6099.326,"Thank you, Council President, and thanks also for your stewardship as we helped put together the Timeline and framework to get this bill over the finish line.",199,,
1007,0.97,6099.326,6107.901,"Council colleagues, it's been through hundreds of conversations with businesses, immigrants rights groups, environmental and housing groups with labor and businesses that jump start came together.",199,,
1008,0.97,6107.901,6111.772,And everyone said these two things.,199,,
1009,0.97,6111.772,6115.609,Residents in Seattle want solutions and they want leadership.,199,,
1010,0.97,6115.609,6125.419,Jump start Seattle offers solutions and the leadership needed to provide immediate Covid relief and support in the out years to weather this crisis.,199,,
1011,0.97,6125.419,6140.834,"This proposal that is in front of us, both the revenue we passed two weeks ago and the detailed spend plan and Covid assistance here was thoughtful, inclusive, strategic, smart, and carefully Crafted.",199,,
1012,0.97,6140.834,6146.573,We welcomed anyone to the table who wanted to advance progressive revenue in Seattle.,199,,
1013,0.97,6146.573,6152.112,"As the prime sponsor of jump start, you can accuse me of a lot of things.",199,,
1014,0.97,6152.112,6161.321,"But everyone knows I'm inclusive, Deliberateive, and data driven.",199,,
1015,0.97,6161.321,6173.667,"We pulled experts from around the country, economists who said the same thing from economic policy Institute, from the University of Massachusetts, from front and center, from budget and policy center.",199,,
1016,0.97,6173.667,6189.65,"Together they said past recessions have proven when governments invest in small business, instead of cuts on austerity, local economies can weather crises in a more equitable way and local economies rebound faster.",199,,
1017,0.97,6189.65,6198.025,There's a proven return on investment in the strategies that we're Vapsing today.,199,,
1018,0.97,6198.025,6206.033,"We have shown when we invest in our community and most vulnerable, there's a Multi-Player effect and we all benefit.",199,,
1019,0.97,6206.033,6214.374,In the state of Washington we have chosen in the city of Seattle to use one of the tools that is a progressive tool to raise revenue in this vital time.,199,,
1020,0.97,6214.374,6218.378,And the proposal in front of us is on solid legal ground.,199,,
1021,0.97,6218.378,6227.287,"The same attorneys that the Mayor relies upon for her legal advice, helps advise us on crafting this policy.",199,,
1022,0.97,6227.287,6235.762,"It's a known fact that payroll taxes are a commonly used tool, one that's a progressive tool that cities can rely on to raise revenue.",199,,
1023,0.97,6235.762,6243.036,We intentionally built off of the legally sound strategy that business and labor and community groups were negotiating in Olympia.,199,,
1024,0.97,6243.036,6251.178,And I want to thank leadership in Olympia and ongoing input on the jump start proposal.,199,,
1025,0.97,6251.178,6278.338,"When the bill stalled in Olympia, we immediately Reengaged with some of the same folks who are engaging in Olympia to assess how we can move forward in Seattle to act as a good partner with our State and regional efforts, to not just say we're going to wait for the next year but to truly engage and step in when the state and region was not able to advance so we could provide immediate Covid relief and out year support.",199,,
1026,0.97,6278.338,6284.578,"So yes, of course, there's other progressive tools I've been an advocate for for over a decade.",199,,
1027,0.97,6284.578,6286.613,And that includes income tax.,199,,
1028,0.97,6286.613,6289.182,That includes capital gains.,199,,
1029,0.97,6289.182,6292.185,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis, for advancing those conversations.",199,,
1030,0.97,6292.185,6293.153,That includes corporate income tax.,199,,
1031,0.97,6293.153,6297.291,"Until we have some of those tools that we can advance, we need to provide relief.",199,,
1032,0.97,6297.291,6302.663,We are going to do so in a responsible way here with the payroll taxes in front of us.,199,,
1033,0.97,6302.663,6309.036,"And of course I would support an income tax as we know, the Mayor wants that and so many others.",199,,
1034,0.97,6309.036,6317.544,We've talked about an income tax but we cannot in a responsible way implement a flat rate income tax without a rebate.,199,,
1035,0.97,6317.544,6321.114,"In the conversations that I've had with the Mayor, I've been very clear.",199,,
1036,0.97,6321.114,6328.388,It would be irresponsible for us to impose a flat rate income tax without a rebate for our lowest wage workers.,199,,
1037,0.97,6328.388,6337.531,"And no, they can't afford $500 or $600 back to the city in a time when they can't afford to pay rent or put food on the table.",199,,
1038,0.97,6337.531,6352.879,These jump start progressive payroll tax bill is the most responsible and the most progressive tax proposal we could put in front of us to act in good faith with State and county actors as we advance other progressive strategies.,199,,
1039,0.97,6352.879,6357.684,I will remain committed to working on progressive revenue just as I have over the last decade.,199,,
1040,0.97,6357.684,6365.559,"We'll continue to fight for more relief for our lowest wage workers, for small businesses to Rightside up our upside down tax code.",199,,
1041,0.97,6365.559,6366.727,Absolutely that will continue to happen.,199,,
1042,0.97,6366.727,6379.673,"And in fact, we're so committed to it, we wrote a predictability clause into the Legislature so if action were to happen at the state or local level, we'd also accommodate that in our statute.",199,,
1043,0.97,6379.673,6381.441,We have to be realistic.,199,,
1044,0.97,6381.441,6384.644,That support is not coming in the immediate future.,199,,
1045,0.97,6384.644,6392.285,"And jump start proposal offers that relief that we need for communities, for small businesses, and for our most vulnerable right now.",199,,
1046,0.97,6392.285,6396.223,I want to echo the Council President's comments.,199,,
1047,0.97,6396.223,6402.829,"While the bill itself was not vetoed, the Mayor has not committed to getting the funding for Covid relief out the door which is critical.",199,,
1048,0.97,6402.829,6416.91,The critical effort for us all is to make sure that the Mayor ALLOCATES the Covid relief dollars as specified in this law after today's vote because any delay would mean the consequences for our city's health and recovery would be dire.,199,,
1049,0.97,6416.91,6424.417,It would be a dereliction of duties not to get this out.,199,,
1050,0.97,6424.417,6435.395,Dereliction of duties means a shameful failure to provide one's obligation.,199,,
1051,0.97,6435.395,6440.967,It is our obligation to make sure immigrants get the support they need.,199,,
1052,0.97,6440.967,6448.608,It's our obligation to help install businesses open up so they can hire more people when they get the green light to open up.,199,,
1053,0.97,6448.608,6458.952,"It's our obligation to make sure more people can keep a roof over their head and food on the table so they can be healthy, sustain themselves and their family and weather this crisis that is Covid.",199,,
1054,0.97,6458.952,6464.09,This is not a Theoret Ical exercise in crafting progressive Prauls.,199,,
1055,0.97,6464.09,6468.395,We're doing this in the midst of a public crisis.,199,,
1056,0.97,6468.395,6470.997,Where housing and food insecurity is not just a moral crisis.,199,,
1057,0.97,6470.997,6472.299,It is a public health crisis.,199,,
1058,0.97,6472.299,6479.739,We're in the midst of a civil rights uprising where black and Brown folks are getting hit with higher rates of Covid-19.,199,,
1059,0.97,6479.739,6483.31,Higher rates of hospitalizations and higher death rates.,199,,
1060,0.97,6483.31,6493.587,"And Coronavirus is leading to more black and Brown communities getting laid off, being on unemployment or without the necessary supports that they need from state and Federal Government.",199,,
1061,0.97,6493.587,6502.696,Where 9 in 10 black owned businesses who applied for Federal support through Ppp didn't get it because of the long history of racist lending practices.,199,,
1062,0.97,6502.696,6509.369,"So we are doing this again as a good partner, stepping up and offering progressive revenue.",199,,
1063,0.97,6509.369,6512.038,Stepping in where the Federal Government has not been able to.,199,,
1064,0.97,6512.038,6515.976,And where the state government has not been able to convene yet.,199,,
1065,0.97,6515.976,6523.283,We're doing this to make sure that we've done it in a smart way to offer relief and make sure that these dollars get out immediately.,199,,
1066,0.97,6523.283,6538.398,"So we look forward to working with you, to working with the Mayor's office, and our entire community to make sure folks can realize the assistance that's been offered in the Covid relief bill and the out years in the jump start spending plan that's now detailed.",199,,
1067,0.97,6538.398,6562.522,"In housing, we continue to hear that there's greater need for individuals to have access to affordable homeownership opportunities and rental assistance and the proposal in front of us deliberately focuses on undoing historic injustices and building resilience and prosperity for black, indigenous, and people of color residents.",199,,
1068,0.97,6562.522,6565.659,We're excited about this proposal and a few I want to highlight.,199,,
1069,0.97,6565.659,6590.016,I'm excited in how this will invest in the work of creative justice and it really focuses on great programs like the one Councilmember Juarez lifted up today for efforts like the youth achievement center that will be able to provide multi-purpose buildings for wrap around services.,199,,
1070,0.97,6590.016,6595.455,Coupling housing and social services and community assets together especially in neighborhoods that have been hardest hit by red lining.,199,,
1071,0.97,6595.455,6605.231,"For the immigrant and refugee population, we know there's thousands of Undocumented families in Seattle who were laid off and intentionally excluded from the cares act at the Federal level.",199,,
1072,0.97,6605.231,6613.606,So we've included $18 million in direct cash assistance in support.,199,,
1073,0.97,6613.606,6618.845,"Throughout Seattle, we've heard from small businesses that they just need flexible dollars.",199,,
1074,0.97,6618.845,6626.82,"Give them the flexibility to hire people back, to change the structure of their business, to create more protection for their employees and their patrons.",199,,
1075,0.97,6626.82,6628.788,And we've offered flexible dollars.,199,,
1076,0.97,6628.788,6634.027,In response to what those small businesses have said they needed to the tune of $18 million.,199,,
1077,0.97,6634.027,6643.67,And that includes Childcare support because many small businesses told us they can't open up without additional child support for their Kiddos or for their employees.,199,,
1078,0.97,6643.67,6644.604,They need Childcare assistance.,199,,
1079,0.97,6644.604,6650.243,And we've planned for the future.,199,,
1080,0.97,6650.243,6664.491,"In the spend plan proposal that is in front of us in just a minute, we've worked with business and labor and community activists and environmental justice folks.",199,,
1081,0.97,6664.491,6672.565,"Alec from 350 Seattle convened a group of 33 leaders plus them two representing labor, climate, environmental justice, affordable housing groups.",199,,
1082,0.97,6672.565,6680.807,And they put together the proposal that we saw in the amended version which focuses on green new deal.,199,,
1083,0.97,6680.807,6698.291,"Matt Remley said this resolution Smultaneously addresses climate crisis by seeking the reduction in Seattle's greenhouse gas emissions, the lack of affordable housing, job training opportunities in the green economy, and addresses the House disparities in Seattle's neighborhoods disproportionately impacted by pollution.",199,,
1084,0.97,6698.291,6701.127,This is precisely what the goals of the green new deal are.,199,,
1085,0.97,6701.127,6709.903,"He says he's honored to have worked alongside our office and members of labor, housing, climate, environmental justice communities with the find amended version in front of us.",199,,
1086,0.97,6709.903,6725.819,"The Mayor had a quote in the Mayor's launch on green and just Covid-19 recovery plans, saying Covid had laid bare the same inequities that are exacerbated by climate change which disproportionately impact communities of color.",199,,
1087,0.97,6725.819,6743.536,And we need to address these by addressing long-term wealth creation that's advanced the health and well-being of black and Brown indigenous communities and not just focus on excluding those folks after the fact but must pursue solutions that address short-term impacts and long-term.,199,,
1088,0.97,6743.536,6746.473,We agree and this proposal does just that.,199,,
1089,0.97,6746.473,6778.404,"It invests in making sure that we're acting on green new deal issues, making sure that we're investing in communities hardest hit in both front line and fence line communities, that we've invested in creating affordable housing because we know as more people get pushed out of the city, the biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions is car pollution and allowing us to make sure there's more affordable housing in the city that people live and want to work and stay makes us on the path toward a greener economy.",199,,
1090,0.97,6778.404,6784.077,These are the issues we're addressing when we came together and put together the jump start Proems in front of us.,199,,
1091,0.97,6784.077,6789.816,This is the moment that we're Respondng to the city's call for leadership and action.,199,,
1092,0.97,6789.816,6792.185,Together we have come up with the solution.,199,,
1093,0.97,6792.185,6805.031,"I want to thank again the community, all my Council colleagues, all the activists, all the organizations that have involved with pushing for more and coming together creating these solutions.",199,,
1094,0.97,6805.031,6817.977,"In front of us we have the blueprint to create a more resilient economy, House more of our community members, feed those dealing with food insecurity and make sure our small Businessvise the resilience they need.",199,,
1095,0.97,6817.977,6823.383,Finally I want to thank my office.,199,,
1096,0.97,6823.383,6826.92,In addition to all of the folks on central staff.,199,,
1097,0.97,6826.92,6836.563,And the communications staff who have been working with us to get the information out to the community and to incorporate all of your amendments in the final proposal in front of us.,199,,
1098,0.97,6836.563,6840.567,We could not do this work without you and the community at large.,199,,
1099,0.97,6840.567,6841.901,So thank you very much.,199,,
1100,0.97,6841.901,6842.268,Making history.,199,,
1101,0.97,6842.268,6845.238,But we got to get these dollars out the door.,199,,
1102,0.97,6845.238,6846.272,That will come next.,199,,
1103,0.97,6846.272,6850.577,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda, for those final remarks.",200,,
1104,0.97,6850.577,6856.082,We're going to go ahead and close out debate on this Council bill.,200,,
1105,0.97,6856.082,6861.854,I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll on the passage of the bill as amended.,200,,
1106,0.97,6861.854,6883.643,"Colleagues, in order to make it easier for our city clerk's office to count your votes in the proper column, there is a request that you vote either aye for yes or no for no because aye and nay sound very, very similar.",200,,
1107,0.97,6883.643,6889.048,"So if you intend to vote no, make sure it's a no as opposed to nay.",200,,
1108,0.97,6889.048,6897.89,And that's something that I'll make sure to occasionally remind us about in order to make sure we have a clearer record for the clerks.,200,,
1109,0.97,6897.89,6904.397,"So that being said, I ask that the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill as amended.",200,,
1110,0.97,6904.397,6906.099,Lewis.,201,,
