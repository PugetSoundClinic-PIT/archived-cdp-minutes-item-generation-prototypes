85,0.97,699.198,714.947,"As a career transportation and utilities professional, it's somewhat mystifying to me as to the rationale to keep the road closed while Sdot is developing Lan plans to design the cycle track around the West Pseudoof the Lake.",15,,

107,0.97,858.791,860.96,It failed as a Reimagining experiment.,21,,
108,0.97,860.96,864.663,No one uses it in any capacity.,21,,
109,0.97,864.663,870.202,Why would anyone use a deserted street for recreation when a park is on either side.,21,,
110,0.97,870.202,876.442,The existing road and bike lanes on it were fully functional and safe.,21,,
111,0.97,876.442,891.924,Those lanes on that road are a full two plus feet wider than the lanes on the two way new paths around the Lake.,21,,

117,0.97,933.532,940.572,It's dishonest and I was surprised Dan to hear there's Ideaings to open it only during commutes and weekends.,21,,
118,0.97,940.572,943.876,It's wrong and we're tired of being disconnected give us our Street back.,21,,

294,0.97,2117.882,2138.169,The policies regarding required public benefits for vacation of the right away at the facility are met in large part by city light conveying the land needed for the Georgetown South Park trail as well adds providing enough land for off leash dog park and contributing towards construction of both.,79,,

302,0.97,2180.111,2186.05,These are the--and somebody might pop in while I'm saying this so we'll give them an opportunity.,81,,

304,0.97,2191.289,2195.726,People call in and get two minutes press Star 6.,81,,
305,0.97,2195.726,2214.545,"And so I'll just go ahead and open the public hearing for clerk file and noting that there are no speakers, I will now close the public hearing on clerk file 314451.",81,,

309,0.97,2234.832,2241.372,"Sfrjts sure, just very briefly to frame your decision today and potentially your next meeting.",81,,
310,0.97,2241.372,2253.251,So this is a street vacation Seattle city light has petitioned the city Council to vacate the public's use of a portion of diagonal way.,81,,
311,0.97,2253.251,2260.424,The Council has adopted policies that includes two part test about whether or not to vacate right of way.,81,,
312,0.97,2260.424,2274.505,The first test is called public trust analysis and it's because the city holds ownership in right of way in trust for the public.,81,,
313,0.97,2274.505,2285.349,"So that part of the analysis asks the Council to consider impacts to transportation and circulation, and access to properties.",81,,
314,0.97,2285.349,2295.192,Utilities use of the right of way for utility functions.,81,,
315,0.97,2295.192,2298.396,Light open air space to use.,81,,

317,0.97,2322.353,2323.22,And free speech.,81,,
318,0.97,2323.22,2329.56,"Second analysis, if it's appropriate to give up the right of way, a public benefit analysis.",81,,
319,0.97,2329.56,2340.204,And the Council should consider whether or not the benefits the public will be receiving from the Vau occasion proposal outweigh the loss to the public from the right of way.,81,,
320,0.97,2340.504,2348.045,Council has a two phase approval process.,81,,
321,0.97,2348.045,2357.355,For vacations like you do for term permits and sky Brajs so this is the first phase of that approval.,81,,
322,0.97,2357.355,2366.897,"If you vote to approve the vacation, it would give city light the ability to permanently close off the right after way.",81,,
323,0.97,2366.897,2377.375,But they will not actually own the right of way until the second phase after they have provided the public benefits that they're committing to provide today.,81,,
324,0.97,2377.375,2380.578,And I'm available for any questions throughout the meeting.,81,,
325,0.97,2380.578,2394.391,"Thank you, that's an excellent overview of the policies that previous Council put in place and I want to thank those members on the previous Council that put those in place.",82,,
326,0.97,2394.391,2408.806,That's helpful to set up guidelines because we're giving up something and we do expect the public benefit in return and the principles you laid out are important and I think we will see that these are being met here.,82,,
327,0.97,2408.806,2419.85,Council members any questions for our central staff before we turn it over to I think Befrly Barnett from Sdot is going first.,82,,

334,0.97,2439.703,2442.907,This project has turned out really well.,84,,
335,0.97,2442.907,2475.139,"So I am Beverly Barnett with Sdot and it's my job to manage the vacation program and I think chair Peterson and Liz have given a good overview of what we look at and what the policies cover so what we want to Presen to you today, Tim crawl from city light who is the project manager is going to present the Powerpoint and we do find that the Powerpoint is the best way to understand the project so you can see the maps and the location and the public benefit proposal.",84,,
336,0.97,2475.139,2491.822,"And then following Tim's presentation, we do have Mike Swin Dale from parks who is the project manager and Haley O' Brian from Sdot working on the trail connection so they will be available if there's any questions.",84,,
337,0.97,2491.822,2506.07,We also have Michael Jenkins who is the executive director of the design Commission and we find the committee usually has some questions about what the design Commission looked at and priorities.,84,,
338,0.97,2506.07,2513.911,So the Sdot recommendation is included as part of your pacts and this was a very straightforward recommendation.,84,,
339,0.97,2513.911,2516.847,Nothing that we particularly need to highlight.,84,,
340,0.97,2516.847,2522.686,This project was interesting because it's really Kand of all about the public benefit.,84,,
341,0.97,2522.686,2536.4,"As you go through the Powerpoint you can see the right of way proposed for vacation is right of way that is dead end, hasn't Ben used by the general public for a long time.",84,,
342,0.97,2536.4,2545.643,It's adjacent to city lights South service center and the vacation will allow city light to fully incorporate and do drainage and other kinds of upgrades on the site.,84,,
343,0.97,2545.643,2553.884,"After we go through everything, if there's any questions about the Sdot recommendation or process.",84,,
344,0.97,2553.884,2558.556,Or anything from Mike or Haley and if you want to hear from Michael Jenkins.,84,,
345,0.97,2558.556,2561.792,We're happy to be here because everything just worked out with this.,84,,
346,0.97,2561.792,2572.369,"We believe the community is supportive of the public benefit proposal and this was a real effort between parks, Sdot and city light.",84,,
347,0.97,2572.369,2574.471,And everything really came together with this.,84,,
348,0.97,2574.471,2582.413,"So unless there's questions for me, I think the best way to understand the project is for Tim to jump in the Powerpoint.",84,,
349,0.97,2582.713,2584.148,.,84,,
350,0.97,2584.448,2593.657,"All right if that's all right, I will share my screen.",85,,
351,0.97,2593.657,2594.425,Hopefully that will.,85,,
352,0.97,2594.725,2604.702,.,85,,
353,0.97,2605.235,2612.142,Site of the vacation requests is our Self-Service center by the West Seattle Viaduct.,86,,
354,0.97,2612.142,2623.954,In the Soto area at the South end of that in between the service center yard and COSTCO.,86,,
355,0.97,2623.954,2630.694,Here's another view of it so this is St strip of Street actually not open now.,86,,
356,0.97,2630.694,2635.265,It's fenced off and they're operating under a street use permit.,86,,
357,0.97,2635.265,2641.772,We're looking for more permanent security before we proceed with improvements.,86,,
358,0.97,2641.772,2655.352,"The strips on that side and on that side are owned by city lights so really, the only adjacent property owners is us.",86,,
359,0.97,2655.352,2661.325,As Beverly mentioned it dead ends so there's no traffic that would be using this site.,86,,
360,0.97,2661.625,2665.796,.,86,,
361,0.97,2666.163,2685.449,Vacation allows us to have the security to make our investments and upgrades in the area more efficient and the public benefit of course is only in the vacation option.,87,,
362,0.97,2685.449,2720.517,There are important Spu infrastructure utilities surface water drain and sewer and a potential future water main in the area and Spu's access and use of that will be preserved if the vacation is granted by a memorandum of understanding and also when the time comes to transfer the ownership of the property by a partial transfer of jurisdiction to Spu so they would have the same rights that they do now for it being a street right away.,87,,
363,0.97,2720.517,2727.057,We carried out a community engagement plan which was approved by Department neighborhoods.,88,,
364,0.97,2727.057,2728.592,Quite extensive including a survey.,88,,
365,0.97,2728.592,2733.997,And the results showed great community support for the proposal.,88,,
366,0.97,2733.997,2748.746,Over 90 percent supporting the vacation and 87% supporting the Flum property transfer for the public benefit and 83% viewed it as a fair public benefit.,88,,
367,0.97,2748.746,2768.499,"Other results we looked at, Georgetown community for many years even before the project they supported the off leash area and the trail segments and through our interaction with the community we have made improvements to the project and added trees and we have added bringing in water to the site to irrigate and water for the dogs to drink.",88,,
368,0.97,2768.499,2787.684,Lighting so that the trail can be used 24-7 and early versions of the proposal involve relying on future funding requests in the CIP to the Council but since then we have identified existing funds so it's fully funded as it stands.,88,,
369,0.97,2787.985,2792.189,.,88,,
370,0.97,2792.689,2798.095,The public benefit would be an off Laesh area and trail segment in Georgetown.,89,,
371,0.97,2798.095,2817.748,"Wantd to point out that the vacation site is in Soto and the public benefit site is in Georgetown, a little distance away but one that we think creates more benefit for the community and fits in with their plans and that proximity so that neighborhood.",89,,
372,0.97,2817.748,2821.051,So the Flum location for the public benefit.,89,,
373,0.97,2821.051,2827.958,There's Boeing field and the Georgetown community so it's south of the Georgetown community.,89,,
374,0.97,2827.958,2838.535,And I wanted to highlight also in addition to the property city lights putting significant money pledging significant money into the development of the off leash area and trail.,89,,
375,0.97,2838.835,2857.387,It's a rather long project and city is helping with portion in the middle.,89,,
376,0.97,2857.387,2860.724,"Myrtle street, Boeing's operation and East marginal way.",89,,
377,0.97,2860.724,2864.561,This is our old Flum.,89,,
378,0.97,2864.561,2875.672,We used to when the river was moved the Flum to allow our cooling water from the old Georgetown steam plant to make it to the river and that's been out of service now for many decades.,89,,
379,0.97,2875.973,2892.155,"Just details of how we're going to transfer the property, the larger segment is going to parks for the off leash area and other amenities and this strip on the West will be for the trail part that will be transferred.",89,,
380,0.97,2892.456,2907.504,"A general overview of the Amenity, a large off leash area here and then a smaller one for a small and shy dog as parks often does.",89,,
381,0.97,2907.504,2929.826,A lot of paving for the access into the benches and parks is feeling good about this design and setting the new bar for Ada accessibility for off leash areas and having the sidewalk paved helps that and then you actually use the trail as a way to get from one area of the project down to the other.,89,,
382,0.97,2930.127,2950.113,There are details of the Entrances the typical air lock gates for the dogs to come in through the different areas and the benches.,89,,
383,0.97,2950.113,2963.927,"Some of the amenities we're expecting, bench and water available for dogs and the gates and off leash area.",89,,
384,0.97,2963.927,2974.104,Sdot provided this general path which will be a shared path for bicycles and pedestrians with buffer on each side.,89,,
385,0.97,2974.104,2979.409,"So milestones on the project, this is the street vacation approval.",89,,
386,0.97,2979.409,2985.182,"This by itself even when Council were to take action on that, it does not actually transfer the property.",89,,
387,0.97,2985.182,2999.73,We will have a is rat ordinance for that to transfer the off leash area and trail area to Sdot on that we expect to be in front of the Council in the near future in the next month or so.,89,,
388,0.97,2999.73,3012.275,The project schedule calls for completing the design this year and the construction plan for next year.,89,,
389,0.97,3012.275,3016.947,This just Recaps the contributions from the different departments.,89,,
390,0.97,3016.947,3029.092,"It's a Multidepartment project and parks and Sdot are each in for $400,000 and that would be cash or in labor in kind work for labor for the design.",89,,
391,0.97,3029.092,3038.468,And for the development cost city light is picking up the rest of almost two million dollars of cash for the development cost.,89,,
392,0.97,3038.468,3052.816,When we add that to the value of the property being transferred it comes out to a total contribution of $3.8 million and the total project is about 4.6 million with all the departments considered.,89,,
393,0.97,3053.116,3056.253,That is the extent of it.,89,,
394,0.97,3056.253,3062.526,Glad to take your questions and I'll keep this up in case people want to refer back to diagrams.,89,,
395,0.97,3062.826,3072.369,Thank you colleagues any questions on that power point before we move on to the other city departments.,90,,
396,0.97,3072.369,3083.28,"E with appreciate those maps every time we hear another piece of legislation for this project, the maps get better and more clear and it's really helpful to see the trade offs that are being made.",90,,
397,0.97,3083.58,3092.522,"Beverly, you want to turn it over to the next?",90,,
398,0.97,3092.522,3119.516,"Yeah, I think so for looking at the off leash area and additional questions on the trail design, we have Haley O' Brian and Mike swindle here and they envision being valuable for questions because we feel like the group presentation covered it.",91,,
399,0.97,3119.516,3128.325,So they are available and Michael Jenkins has comments on the design Commission process and everyone else is available for questions so I think Michael would be next then.,91,,
400,0.97,3128.325,3135.699,Unless there are questions on off leash area or that trail design piece.,91,,
401,0.97,3135.699,3139.603,Any questions at this point before we hear from Mr. Jenkins?,92,,
402,0.97,3139.603,3147.277,"We're not voting on it today so if you have questions, you can get answers between now and we vote on it at the next meeting.",92,,
403,0.97,3147.577,3157.32,Good morning Council members can you hear me okay?,93,,
404,0.97,3157.32,3157.554,"Yes,.",94,,
405,0.97,3157.554,3158.555,Great thank you.,95,,
406,0.97,3158.555,3160.757,I wanted to take a few minutes.,95,,
407,0.97,3160.757,3167.364,This is an important project for the Commission and certainly an important project for the Georgetown neighborhood.,95,,
408,0.97,3167.364,3182.045,"Just want to remind you, Council members about the role of the Commission in vacations as Lish had in his opening comments, the Commission and all the reviewers look at two fundamental issues.",95,,
409,0.97,3182.045,3189.553,Public trust which St loss of the right of way and its impact on the function of the remaining roadway.,95,,
410,0.97,3189.553,3191.021,And public benefit.,95,,
411,0.97,3191.021,3198.628,How is the public actually benefitting from public improvements to off set the loss of the right of way.,95,,
412,0.97,3198.628,3211.775,We also have a unique role when the city seeks a vacation of a right of way because as like all vacations there needs to be concurrent development.,95,,
413,0.97,3211.775,3220.483,So we also review the proposal like we review the capital projects coming before us so we conducted that review concurrently as well.,95,,
414,0.97,3220.483,3226.289,Then the full Commission after I looked at this project three times it was an important project for the Commission because of the outcomes.,95,,
415,0.97,3226.289,3236.666,"In terms of the loss of the right of way, given the nature in the role of this segment at diagonal South.",95,,
416,0.97,3236.666,3260.257,No significant issues found and frankly sees the support and gives support to light based on proposal which enhances safety and security for the South service center as well as addressing ongoing utility needs specifically with drainage on the site like Tim talked about.,95,,
417,0.97,3260.257,3279.342,"In Terps of public benefit package, it's fair to say the Commission was um pressed in general with Seattle city lights transfer of underutilized land to fill a need NA was identified by the Georgetown community Pru through what was clearly significant community engagement.",95,,
418,0.97,3279.342,3293.957,The Georgetown community has been deficient in the Resurfaces frankly and I think it also provides an important lesson for our elected and seeing the role of converting underutilized city properties into working community assets.,95,,
419,0.97,3294.257,3320.283,"Kwift to other open spaces we have seen in the city, Seattle city light created an important partnership with Sdot to implement Improments that makes this open space as a community assess.",95,,
420,0.97,3320.283,3335.231,Haley O' Brian is managing the South Park trail and this is an important part in the larger commitment that the Council Financeded last year.,95,,
421,0.97,3335.231,3338.401,And the design is working to design specifics.,95,,
422,0.97,3338.401,3361.191,What we see here also is the result of this project that the cost associated with the development exceed the actual value of the flowing property which was an important part in the project's success and one that we want to thank Seattle city light for doing much more than they originally intended to do beyond the transfer of the property.,95,,
423,0.97,3361.191,3367.03,So on behalf of the Commission I want to thank Seattle city lights for that leadership.,95,,
424,0.97,3367.03,3374.938,We're thrilled to see a positive outcome and especially how city departments can work together to create positive community outcomes.,95,,
425,0.97,3374.938,3375.438,So thank you.,95,,
426,0.97,3375.438,3381.911,Again I want to thank Tim and his team for committing to such an important project for the neighborhood.,95,,

481,0.97,3747.11,3759.822,Those are standard that is have additional requirements due to the due care of Aud Di and quality Asureness and continuing education.,105,,
482,0.97,3759.822,3762.625,Supervision of our audit team and independence.,105,,
483,0.97,3762.625,3771.534,Our OB apologetic Tiff is obtain reasonable Assurens that final statements are free from material Misstatement.,105,,
484,0.97,3771.534,3780.61,They received an unmodified opinion known as the clean opinion which is the highest level of Asureness that we can provide.,105,,
485,0.97,3780.61,3781.043,As your audit firm.,105,,
486,0.97,3781.043,3781.344,Next slide.,105,,
487,0.97,3781.344,3787.917,"When we take a look at your audit, I would say 30% of what we do is specific to internal controls.",105,,
488,0.97,3787.917,3795.458,What we'll do is take a look at your major processes whether it's your expenditures and receivables and billing.,105,,
489,0.97,3795.458,3802.798,We'll take a look at those and identify what key controls or what key internal controls are part of the processes.,105,,
490,0.97,3802.798,3806.435,And we'll test those to make sure they're effective.,105,,
491,0.97,3806.435,3820.75,I would say the majority of the types of controls we look at are information technology based and so much so in fact that we use a certified information systems auditor to go about and conduct that testing.,105,,
492,0.97,3820.75,3827.557,I will say that this it internal control portion of the audit engagement continues to grow every year.,105,,
493,0.97,3827.557,3833.429,And that's not surprising given the dynamic nature of Cyber security and information technology.,105,,
494,0.97,3833.729,3837.233,That's 30% of what we do.,105,,
495,0.97,3837.233,3847.476,40% of what we do then is relative to substantive testing taking a look at your fixed asset additions and tracing those back to the invoices.,105,,
496,0.97,3847.476,3854.717,"Taking a look at your cash investments and making sure that your cash and investments are reported at fair value, things like that.",105,,
497,0.97,3854.717,3860.99,"This is basically the nuts and bolts of the audit, if you will and that's 40% of what we do.",105,,
498,0.97,3860.99,3866.329,Then the remaining 30% has to do our planning of the audit and also the financial reporting at the end.,105,,
499,0.97,3866.329,3870.733,What I've done here is listed the major areas of focus.,105,,
500,0.97,3870.733,3876.005,Most of these should be of new surprise.,105,,
501,0.97,3876.005,3879.842,"Capital assesses and if you were look at the balance sheet, it makes up a majority.",105,,
502,0.97,3880.142,3895.024,I mentioned earlier as auditors we provide an opinion on your financial statements.,105,,
503,0.97,3895.024,3899.862,"I wanted to clarify though, we do not provide an opinion on internal controls.",105,,
504,0.97,3899.862,3911.274,"However, as part of our audit when we come across significant deficiencies in internal controls, we would need to communicate those to you.",105,,
505,0.97,3911.274,3916.812,The profession requires us for any internal control to evaluate the se Varity of the break down.,105,,
506,0.97,3917.113,3943.139,That's the possibility your financial statements would be mess Tated because of that lack of control and that's the most severe.,106,,
507,0.97,3943.139,3945.474,We did not identify any material weaknesses.,106,,
508,0.97,3945.474,3955.151,The next category would be Wa we call significant deficiency.,106,,
509,0.97,3955.151,3968.731,Obviously it's less and not identify any significant deficiencies.,106,,
510,0.97,3968.731,3972.168,Often have Nba nor control deficiencies and industry best practices.,106,,
511,0.97,3972.168,3978.307,The end of the audit engagement will communicate those with management which we do every year as part of the audit process.,106,,
512,0.97,3978.307,3983.346,Most of those are always going to revolve around the information technology area.,106,,
513,0.97,3983.346,3987.583,"Again, because it is so dynamic and constantly changing.",106,,
514,0.97,3987.583,3997.626,But we have those discussions with management and just wanted to Fufrth everyone Saz that we don't deem any of those to be material or significant.,106,,
515,0.97,3997.626,3997.927,Next slide.,106,,
516,0.97,3997.927,4019.582,"Brap if you look at those financial statements in one, it contains all of city lights accounting policies.",106,,
517,0.97,4019.582,4022.651,And an example of that would be the capitalization policy.,106,,
518,0.97,4022.651,4042.638,"What we Knead to do is make sure that your policies comply with General linked principles and not only do the policies comply but that you're following those so if you get a chance, I would urge you to take a look at one and see the different types used.",106,,
519,0.97,4042.638,4045.007,With putting your financial statements together.,106,,
520,0.97,4045.007,4062.324,I often get asked when governing bodies or bond holders or anyone looks at your financial statements what are the limitations of those financial statements or what could potentially be the risks and I'll always say that it's anything that has to do with an estimate because it's exactly that.,106,,
521,0.97,4062.324,4078.007,The amounts are disclosures that we don't let the inclusive significant amount of uncertainty so I think a great example of this would be city lights proportion Gnat share of the employee retirement system liability.,106,,
522,0.97,4078.007,4087.583,So one of the important assumptions is the discount rate.,106,,
523,0.97,4087.583,4098.694,"That discount rate should be 7.25% as determined so with that, city lights proportion Gnat share of that retirement STM liability is $265 million.",106,,
524,0.97,4098.694,4104.967,If we were to increase that discount rate to 8.25%.,106,,
525,0.97,4104.967,4108.838,That liability would decrease to $169 million.,106,,
526,0.97,4108.838,4117.78,"Likewise, if we decreased the discount rate to 6.25%, your liability would become 379 million.",106,,
527,0.97,4117.78,4123.586,So as an auditor can I say that your liability is $265 million?,106,,
528,0.97,4123.586,4125.287,As recorded in your financial statements?,106,,
529,0.97,4125.287,4126.489,I can't say that with certainty.,106,,
530,0.97,4126.489,4147.543,"But what I can tell you is more than likely that liability depending on certain assumptions in the upcoming potential changes in the future, it's more than likely somewhere between 169 million, 379 million but again, this is just one illustration.",106,,
531,0.97,4147.543,4154.483,That there is sensitivity and you should be aware of those things.,106,,
532,0.97,4154.483,4160.089,A couple other items the self-insurance liability we have recorded and the allowance for doubtful accounts.,106,,
533,0.97,4160.389,4171.066,Unbilled Rev Knews and environmental remediation liability.,106,,
534,0.97,4171.367,4185.581,If we had significant difficulties we would need to disclose those and for this year we did not.,106,,
535,0.97,4185.581,4196.525,"Just NOTE again as part of the process, if we had any significant difficulties or significant findings this would not be the first time that you folks would be hearing about those.",106,,
536,0.97,4196.525,4206.402,I would reach out to you separately the moment we Ie accident few these and we would have these discussions on a timely basis.,106,,
537,0.97,4206.402,4214.343,If we had any uncorrected statements we're required to disclose those to you and they're attached to your Adit results letter.,106,,
538,0.97,4214.343,4223.152,I know these uncorrected statements are Senator material and they were identified by management not as part of the audit process.,106,,
539,0.97,4223.152,4237.099,Often times these material entries to your financial statements are not recorded simply to expedite in process your financial statement results so late in the air sometimes additional entries may come to light.,106,,
540,0.97,4237.099,4243.072,If there's small in nature management may choose not to change the entire statement book.,106,,
541,0.97,4243.072,4252.615,And as need to know you what those are so attached to this letter uncorrected misstatements and they were Trip-And-Fall Yan and immaterial.,107,,
542,0.97,4252.915,4260.556,Were trivial and immaterial.,107,,
543,0.97,4260.556,4264.226,If we had disagreements with management we would need to disclose those.,108,,
544,0.97,4264.526,4270.866,"Next slide, please.",108,,
545,0.97,4272.735,4286.649,If we had any material corrected misstatements we would need to disclose those and we did not have any.,108,,
546,0.97,4286.649,4286.949,Next slide.,108,,
547,0.97,4286.949,4297.059,The audit community occasion letter with E have management representations and if you haven't looked at that I would urge you to do so.,109,,
548,0.97,4297.059,4302.865,Within this representation letter management will attest to many different things as part of the audit process.,109,,
549,0.97,4302.865,4309.405,They will attest to thoughts on fraud risk and internal controls.,109,,
550,0.97,4309.405,4310.572,Accounting policies and significant estimates.,109,,
551,0.97,4310.572,4324.186,"But again, if you haven't, take a look at the types of things that management is taking or making representations to in the process.",109,,
552,0.97,4324.186,4342.504,If there were any communications from the management team with any other audit if you remembers we would be required to be notified of those communications and pleased to report we are not aware of any communications with any outside auditors or accountants.,110,,
553,0.97,4342.504,4342.738,Next slide.,110,,
554,0.97,4343.038,4361.356,Auditor independence as you're more than likely aware we as a firm require independent to conduct your audit and I'm here to state that our firm and every individual on it is independent in fact and in appearance relative to your organization.,111,,
555,0.97,4361.657,4367.329,Next slide.,111,,
556,0.97,4367.796,4375.07,I would like to open up to questions again.,111,,
557,0.97,4375.07,4398.694,"Everyone at City light for their help during the process and again, you can imagine how difficult an audit is normally but in a remote environment it adds different areas of complexity but again very please bid the effort of the Department staff and we were able to conduct the audit without any issues and again appreciate the help that they have provided during the process.",111,,
558,0.97,4398.694,4402.631,But at this time I'll take any questions anyone might have.,111,,
559,0.97,4402.631,4419.448,"Thank you very much for that thorough independent overview of Seattle city lights financial statements and its good news that there are no material adverse findings there and colleagues, this is just an informational item on your agenda.",112,,
560,0.97,4419.448,4423.218,Not voting on anything.,112,,
561,0.97,4423.218,4428.457,Any questions colleagues for city lathe or independent auditor?,112,,
562,0.97,4428.457,4429.158,"Yes, her bolt?",113,,
563,0.97,4429.158,4460.823,Thanks I am a little bit more familiar with the Seattle public utilities audit having chaired the committee with the oversight of a few for a while and the Spu financial audits also included specific recommendations but they incorporated information that clarified whether the Department accepted the recommendations and their implementation status.,114,,
564,0.97,4460.823,4471.867,There's some recommendations on page 19 of the audit results document but I didn't see where to find information about how Seattle city light will be implementing the recommendations.,114,,
565,0.97,4472.167,4475.971,.,114,,
566,0.97,4476.271,4480.576,We have a management response loader in the process of going back to Erin.,115,,
567,0.97,4480.576,4490.485,"As he mentioned an overview, the recommendations are largely around technology access and pass word policies.",115,,
568,0.97,4490.485,4492.821,Audit logs.,115,,
569,0.97,4492.821,4505.1,We're rounding up those responses in conjunction with people at Seattle Stu light but we plan to in the process of we plan to carry out all the recommendations.,115,,
570,0.97,4505.1,4505.367,Thank you.,116,,
571,0.97,4505.667,4515.911,If you're planning on doing this anyway but please do circulate that to members of the committee so we can close the Loop on that.,116,,
572,0.97,4515.911,4517.813,Thank you will do and thank you.,116,,
573,0.97,4518.113,4526.455,Colleagues any other questions for the Seattle city light or independent auditor.,117,,
574,0.97,4526.455,4530.025,"? well, thank you for joining us today at our committee.",117,,
575,0.97,4530.025,4535.23,We appreciate it and if we do have any follow up questions we will reach out to you.,117,,
576,0.97,4535.23,4540.469,Thank you very much for your time and attention on this matter.,118,,
577,0.97,4540.469,4540.936,Greatly appreciated.,118,,
578,0.97,4540.936,4542.905,"All right, thank you.",119,,
579,0.97,4542.905,4550.245,"Next we're going to our other one billion dollar enterprise, Seattle public utilities.",119,,
580,0.97,4550.245,4559.555,Will the clerk please read the short titles of the next three agenda items into the record.,119,,
581,0.97,4559.555,4573.602,This is deputy clerk Swin and I'll read those items in for you.,120,,
582,0.97,4573.602,4575.103,"Great, thank you.",121,,
583,0.97,4575.103,4589.117,An ordinance related to drainage services of Seattle public utilities adjusting drainage rates to pass to treatment rates charged by King County and meet capital financing requirements.,122,,
584,0.97,4589.117,4598.694,An ordinance relating to waste water services of Seattle public utilities and discussing waste water rates.,122,,
585,0.97,4598.694,4611.606,And an agenda item 15 an ordinance relating to rates and charges for water services of Seattle public utilities and revising water rates and charges and credits to low income customers for briefing and discussion.,122,,
586,0.97,4611.907,4619.214,"Thank you and colleagues as our clerk said, this is just for briefing and discussion today.",123,,
587,0.97,4619.214,4626.755,We'll be voting on these at the next committee meeting and we have seen these numbers before.,123,,
588,0.97,4626.755,4642.337,Items 13-15 on our agenda and these rate ordinances are implementing the strategic business plan and endorsed by not only the customer review panel but the city Council and resolution 32000 on May 10th.,123,,
589,0.97,4642.337,4648.31,Fortunately the average rates are lower than what was promised during the previous plan in 2017.,123,,
590,0.97,4648.31,4675.937,"This was made possible thanks to ideas proposed by our previous committee Xhar and Councilmen her bolt as well as the laser focus of our general manager and her team keeping rates low and it's important because rates are Regressive with lower income House-Holds paying a larger percentage of income for utility bills and many cost drivers unlike Seattle city light, several lines of business here at Spu.",123,,
591,0.97,4675.937,4691.253,And their pass through rates we can control from King County for waste water and environmental protection projects protected by labor cost and utility taxes caused by the general fund.,123,,
592,0.97,4691.253,4703.031,So today we will hear from Seattle public utilities and at our next meeting we'll vote on the three ordinances.,123,,
593,0.97,4703.031,4713.575,"And I believe our central staff analysts are here, thank you for joining us did you want to make introductory comments on these items before we turn it Toefr the general manager.",123,,
594,0.97,4713.575,4716.211,"Thank you, no I don't have any.",124,,
595,0.97,4716.211,4718.947,"Happy to just turn it over, thank you.",124,,
596,0.97,4718.947,4728.29,Thanks for your ongoing work on this strategic business plan and the rate path and during our previous meetings.,125,,
597,0.97,4728.29,4728.89,General manager Hara please.,125,,
598,0.97,4728.89,4737.032,Council member thank you for the introductory comments and thank you everybody for your attention to these three rates ordinances.,126,,
599,0.97,4737.032,4743.071,I would like to provide a little bit of context.,126,,
600,0.97,4743.071,4744.606,If that's okay.,126,,
601,0.97,4744.606,4751.88,Our practice is to adjust rates Serially for each of our three lines of business on a three year cycle.,126,,
602,0.97,4751.88,4760.155,So we typically bring you a three year rate package for one line of business.,126,,
603,0.97,4760.155,4767.662,"So in effect for example waste rates one year, water the next and drainage rates the following year.",126,,
604,0.97,4767.662,4780.108,But because of the anticipated financial impacts of Covid on our communities and finances we did not implement a rate increase for 2021.,126,,
605,0.97,4780.108,4785.247,Therefore the water rate increase is only for two years.,126,,
606,0.97,4785.247,4793.021,2022 through 2023 and the drainage rates and waste water rates are for three years.,126,,
607,0.97,4793.021,4795.657,2022 and 2023 and 2024.,126,,
608,0.97,4795.657,4801.563,This way we'll keep on our anticipated serial three year cycle.,126,,
609,0.97,4801.563,4840.001,"And as Council member Peterson noted you will recall that Council adopted our Stra Stee Jik business plan and rate path for 2021-2026 back in May and the legislation before the committee enacts rates identified in the strategic business plan and I'm very please, sired to report the rates opposing are lower than the 4.2 annual average rate increase projected in the strategic business plan and Maria our rates manager is with me today to walk you through a presentation of how that all works and to answer any questions you might have.",126,,
610,0.97,4840.001,4846.641,So I'm going to ask Maria to begin the presentation unless Council member Peterson you have questions before we start.,126,,
611,0.97,4846.942,4849.01,.,126,,
612,0.97,4849.511,4849.878,Please proceed.,127,,
613,0.97,4849.878,4850.145,Thank you.,128,,
614,0.97,4850.445,4855.116,.,128,,
615,0.97,4855.417,4856.117,"Thank you, everybody.",129,,
616,0.97,4856.117,4870.131,My name is Maria Co and I'm the rates manager of Spu and I'm going to give you an update on the path for water rates and drainage for years 2022-2024.,129,,
617,0.97,4870.131,4879.407,"Before you are three separate sets of legislation, for your review and approval, there we go.",129,,
618,0.97,4879.407,4883.712,That will adopt rates as part of the strategic business plan.,129,,
619,0.97,4883.712,4894.623,First we'll briefly visit what you endorsed as part of the business plan and then I'll show you what the overall updated rates are based on results for these lines of business.,129,,
620,0.97,4894.623,4901.563,Finally I'll give you background on why the rates have changed and highlight the changes in each line of business.,129,,
621,0.97,4901.563,4905.533,"So to begin with, this is our currently endorsed rate path.",129,,
622,0.97,4905.533,4912.474,"As you may remember, we proposed the rate path as part of the business plan earlier this spring and the Council formally endorsed it in May.",129,,
623,0.97,4912.474,4920.315,You'll notice in the lower right hand corner the overall average rate path is 4.2% among the confined lines of business.,129,,
624,0.97,4920.315,4925.22,The gray area shows the rates that Council adopted by ordinance.,129,,
625,0.97,4925.22,4930.959,We typically conduct rate studies for each of the lines of businesses every three years.,129,,
626,0.97,4930.959,4942.17,"Based on the rate studies findings, and several other factors which I'll highlight in a minute, we have good news with respect to the proposed Repath going forward.",129,,
627,0.97,4942.47,4947.776,So this is a slide we really wanted you to see.,129,,
628,0.97,4947.776,4953.915,This provides an updated six year rate path Incorp.Ed in the studies shown in the blue shaded average.,129,,
629,0.97,4953.915,4962.891,The new average rate is now at 3.9% compared to 4.2% originally proposed as you saw in the previous slide.,129,,
630,0.97,4962.891,4966.761,This change is due to several reasons which we'll detail in a moment.,129,,
631,0.97,4966.761,4976.271,"Before we get to that, this next slide highlights the changes to the average residential customer as a result of the lower rates.",129,,
632,0.97,4976.271,4979.107,It's a slight decrease but every little bit counts.,129,,
633,0.97,4979.107,4983.445,So first we'll start with the water rate study.,129,,
634,0.97,4983.445,4985.947,Here's our proposed lower rate for the water rate study.,129,,
635,0.97,4985.947,4996.458,You'll notice that the rate path is lower to an average of 3.1% per year compared with 3.4 per year adopted in the strategic business plan.,129,,
636,0.97,4996.458,5020.815,As mentioned we have three year rate cycles but with Covid we're able to keep water at 0% for 2021 and we're proposing two years of increase to zinc up to the cycle since the plan the water fund has not only sold bonds but was able to refund and buy back and resale at lower interest rates existing debt.,129,,
637,0.97,5020.815,5034.529,"Coupled with recent rate increase to AAA, which is the Huest rating possible from standard fours it was not incorporated into the strategic business plan.",129,,
638,0.97,5034.529,5037.932,It also assumed less revenue from wholesale water customers.,129,,
639,0.97,5037.932,5044.739,"Since then, rates and revenue are being held constant resulting in increased revenue relative to the plan.",129,,
640,0.97,5044.739,5051.446,"As we come out of Covid, we're anticipating revenues to grow more slowly than previously anticipated.",129,,
641,0.97,5051.446,5061.456,"And Fieblly, the con sums forecast was updated to reflect increased population and density whereas we were previously anticipating the small slow down.",129,,
642,0.97,5061.456,5069.097,In addition to consumption growth and con Supgs we have updated the utility program for continued growth.,129,,
643,0.97,5069.397,5080.408,"Next, we will walk through the drainage and waste water rate proposal which reflect updates to the strategic business plan since it was developed and approved.",129,,
644,0.97,5080.708,5092.587,For the drainage and waste water rates we were able to produce a rate path not only smoother compared with the strategic business plan but also lower.,129,,
645,0.97,5092.587,5106.801,The plan projected average annual waste water changes of 4.7% compared with updated projections of 4.2% and drainage rates Projectd to be 6.7% annually but now at 6.3%.,129,,
646,0.97,5107.101,5121.416,Drainage and waste water was also able to recognize significant savings from accommodation of new lower cost bonds and activity in late May.,130,,
647,0.97,5121.416,5134.028,The fund also had the rating agency negative outlook designation removed as a result of strong leadership in stable performance through Covid.,130,,
648,0.97,5134.028,5141.136,Customers assumption were also updated reflecting the increased density and participation in the utility discount program.,130,,
649,0.97,5141.136,5144.806,It places downward pressure on the rates.,130,,
650,0.97,5144.806,5146.941,The King County waste water rate.,130,,
651,0.97,5146.941,5153.348,When the plan was adopted the county was projecting 10.25 treatment increases every other year.,130,,
652,0.97,5153.348,5165.426,"Since the treatment rate accounts for 40% of the funds expenses, the double digit increases followed by year of no rate increase was causing large swings in our rate path.",130,,
653,0.97,5165.426,5175.77,The County has since adopted annual increases of 4% for 2022 and is projecting annual increases of 4% during the rate period hoping to smooth the rates further.,130,,
654,0.97,5176.07,5183.578,We thought it would be important to highlight one of the main drivers of our rates.,130,,
655,0.97,5183.578,5190.785,The ship Canal water quality project is the largest and most expensive project the city has ever undertaken.,130,,
656,0.97,5190.785,5198.593,One of the host of projects required under Federal consent decree which impacts rates for those two lines of business.,130,,
657,0.97,5198.593,5215.843,The table provides a Snapshot of the impact the projects have on each of the water and drainage rates.,130,,
658,0.97,5215.843,5219.213,This final slide provides an update path.,130,,
659,0.97,5219.213,5225.386,The average annual increase is at 3.9% compared to 2.4% originally proposed.,130,,
660,0.97,5225.386,5233.795,Essentially Spu was able to leverage the bond sales and better ratings and change in county treatment rates to our advantage ultimately lowering rates to customers.,130,,
661,0.97,5233.795,5233.995,Thank you.,130,,
662,0.97,5234.295,5272.166,Want to thank Spu getting them closer to the rate of inflation and vesting previous so many initiatives to Lowerng those rates.,131,,
663,0.97,5272.166,5284.078,"Especially when we don't have a lot of control over those rates the past through from King County, for example.",131,,
664,0.97,5284.078,5294.589,Council members any questions about this Pressation or the three ordinates that will be implementing the rates for the three lines of Spu business.,131,,
665,0.97,5294.589,5296.024,Again Council member Straus.,131,,
666,0.97,5296.024,5306.2,"Yes, thank you chair Peterson and thank you to Spu to coming before us with this information today.",132,,
667,0.97,5306.2,5312.907,This slide is indicating where we're going and director Hara if you could briefly share with us.,132,,
668,0.97,5312.907,5326.387,I know you shared at the beginning of the Pressation on other slides what's the difference between these rates and the strategic business plan proposal rates so that we can all have it in one place.,132,,
669,0.97,5326.387,5327.121,"Sure, of course.",133,,
670,0.97,5327.121,5336.13,We have a slide that I believe shows the Prooe Yously proposed for an average of 4.2%.,133,,
671,0.97,5336.13,5346.14,Annual rate increases and for the six year rate period and now we are proposing 3.9.,133,,
672,0.97,5346.14,5352.146,Additionally the 4.2 bettered our projection from this business plan that proceeded.,133,,
673,0.97,5352.146,5383.377,"The newest one and so this represents successive attempts to better in terms of Affordability and I do have to give many thanks to members of Council including new Council member Peter son, council member her bolt who have been our chairs and to others such as yourself who have taken a serious interest in how to increase the Affordability.",133,,
674,0.97,5383.377,5388.249,I have to really share what advocates that Council members are for rate Affordability.,133,,
675,0.97,5388.249,5388.449,Thank you.,133,,
676,0.97,5388.75,5389.984,Thank you.,134,,
677,0.97,5390.551,5397.358,And so I'm seeing drainage at 8.6 in the proposal and waste water at 3.1.,134,,
678,0.97,5397.358,5406.4,Can we slide back to where we were.,134,,
679,0.97,5406.4,5407.869,This does it justice here.,134,,
680,0.97,5407.869,5418.079,"I'm seeing drainage was reduced by nearly 2% and waste water was also reduced for this year which thank you, congratulations good work here.",134,,
681,0.97,5418.079,5429.69,"I know in our conversations we discussed similar to how Seattle city light, their rates are dependent upon the Bonneville power administrations rates that are passed through to the city.",134,,
682,0.97,5429.69,5439.0,Can you speak just a minute about how we have the similar situation with King County for both drainage and waste water?,134,,
683,0.97,5439.0,5440.268,"Yes, of course.",135,,
684,0.97,5440.268,5443.805,I don't know that folks are generally aware.,135,,
685,0.97,5443.805,5461.522,Definitely Council is but that the general public is aware King County provides treatment services for waste water as a city and that our rates include the cost of King County treatment.,135,,
686,0.97,5461.522,5471.265,And we do not impact the rates that they set but there are normally just passed through and included into our rates.,135,,
687,0.97,5471.265,5475.336,Is that sufficient would you like more detail?,135,,
688,0.97,5475.336,5485.746,"Yes, it's Helpfu context to understand that while you do your best to reduce our rates, some of it is out of your control.",136,,
689,0.97,5485.746,5507.535,"In this case, King County SETS rates that we have to then pass on to Seattle Iets and I'm noticing here we discussed before this meeting the drainage and waste water specifically the Dranl Aj rates and they are the highest percentages on this chart.",136,,
690,0.97,5507.535,5515.009,When we discussed we were talking about the consent decree that we are under for drainage water.,136,,
691,0.97,5515.009,5525.052,Could you speak to that and also to the how large are the projects that you are working on right now to meet that consent decree.,136,,
692,0.97,5525.052,5527.955,We have the ship Canal water quality project.,136,,
693,0.97,5527.955,5533.16,Can you remind me is that the Moeks expensive project the city has undertaken.,136,,
694,0.97,5533.16,5536.464,Can you help me understand why the percentages are so high.,136,,
695,0.97,5536.464,5537.632,"Yes, of course.",137,,
696,0.97,5537.632,5544.872,Can I ask you to go to the ship Canal water quality project slide.,137,,
697,0.97,5544.872,5545.072,Great.,137,,
698,0.97,5545.072,5548.509,Wonderful and thank you so much.,137,,
699,0.97,5548.509,5596.257,"Yes, the city of Seattle has inherited legacy system that includes a combined if not in total but significant portion of the city served by combined sewer and drainage systems that will over flow in extreme storm events and that must be Encontrolled through different measures that can include detaining the water before it goes to the waste water treatment plan and overwhelming the capacity of the system or through green Infrastrauk Chur depending on the characteristics of the system and land that feed into the storm water system.",137,,
700,0.97,5596.257,5623.417,"And so any given place, we use a variety of approaches and we are machine dated to reduce Overflows to no more than 1 overflow per out fall per year and which is a exceedingly high threshold well beyond any national thresholds.",137,,
701,0.97,5623.417,5639.533,This is a local state requirement and so our consent decree embodies those requirements through projects that are anticipated to meet that requirement.,137,,
702,0.97,5639.533,5647.641,So the overall cost of the projects what I will get to so I don't MITS quote it.,137,,
703,0.97,5647.641,5664.392,It's driving rates to a pretty profound degree and that's why our drainage and waste water rates are as high as they are as the primary driver in costs.,137,,
704,0.97,5664.392,5664.825,Thank you.,138,,
705,0.97,5664.825,5693.387,Just wanted to receive that information here on the record because it is important for us to understand that there are cost drivers which create those high percentages and then I also want to highlight the fact that you again have brought us a rate path that is lower than what was in the endorsed strategic business Mrab so understanding that we have a lot of work to do to meet that one or fewer Overflows per year.,138,,
706,0.97,5693.387,5700.694,There's a lot of work to do and that's where a lot of the cost drivers are coming from.,138,,
707,0.97,5700.694,5712.44,"Just for the general public's Wareness, those Overflows are different than what has happened at the West point treatment facility when they have had outflows that pollute the water.",138,,
708,0.97,5712.44,5722.65,And so it is important that we increase our water quality and this is where those dollars are going.,138,,
709,0.97,5722.65,5743.37,So just once again understanding that we have very high cost drivers influencing these rate paths and Seattle public utility has done a great job to meet our external drivers and reduce our rates as best as possible.,138,,
710,0.97,5743.37,5744.071,So thank you director and Maria.,138,,
711,0.97,5744.071,5749.577,Thank you very much and to all of you for your interest.,139,,
712,0.97,5749.577,5752.513,"In making sure these costs are low and programs are well run, thank you.",139,,
713,0.97,5752.813,5758.018,Colleagues any other comments or questions?,140,,
714,0.97,5758.018,5763.757,These are our last three items on the agenda and we'll conclude the meetings if there's no final questions.,140,,
715,0.97,5764.058,5772.5,Just a reminder these ordinances are back to the committee to vote on them.,140,,
716,0.97,5772.5,5784.979,"So seeing no final comments, from the committee members, we will go ahead and say goodbye to Spu and thank you Brian for being here and thank you colleagues.",140,,
717,0.97,5784.979,5789.817,"This concludes the July 21st, 2021, meeting of the utilities and transportation committee.",140,,
718,0.97,5789.817,5795.956,We will meet again our next regularly scheduled time Wednesday August 4TH.,140,,
719,0.97,5795.956,5797.658,Thank you all for attending.,140,,
720,0.97,5797.658,5800.394,This concludes the meeting and we're adjourned.,140,,
721,0.97,5800.394,5800.795,Thank you Bye.,141,,
