71,0.97,348.915,364.097,That process will require investigators to not police despite the fact that SPD sergeants.,26,,
72,0.97,364.097,370.803,The Council is recognizing the problems with police investigating police but instead of putting an end to this corrupt system you are legislating a tiny work around for a specific type of complaint.,26,,
73,0.97,370.803,382.715,This is a system entirely rejected by the state Legislature in 2021 when they sit at the office of independent investigation to investigate the police use of deadly force.,26,,
74,0.97,382.715,387.487,"But for Seattle it is okay to have cops investigate cops, finding that each and every police killing his lawful and proper.",26,,
75,0.97,387.487,393.993,Instead of a Carveout like you are voting on today you need a complete overhaul of our failed police accountability system.,26,,
76,0.97,393.993,403.736,"We need direct beauty control of complaint investigations, discipline and most importantly as we learned.",26,,

89,0.97,478.478,492.425,Democrats of had 50 years to codify Roe and have fun raised heavily.,31,,
90,0.97,492.425,501.434,"[Indiscernible] of the executive orders are in line, we know how easily these orders are ignored or imbalanced.",31,,
91,0.97,501.434,506.105,The Councilmembers who have spoken in support of abortion and Healthcare have an Oblgation to vote otherwise they're just hollow words.,31,,

96,0.97,533.132,547.48,"I think it's important because as have been said, the executive orders will not go far enough and need to be codified into law.",33,,
97,0.97,547.48,553.853,It needs to be safe for people to feel like they can get the care they need without feeling like they have to be in some emergency state or risk their lives.,33,,
98,0.97,553.853,555.454,That is all I have to say.,33,,
99,0.97,555.454,557.089,"Please support this legislation, it is very important.",33,,

103,0.97,586.118,598.13,The Supreme Court dangerous decision to overturn Roe versus wade has already had impact.,36,,
104,0.97,598.13,603.269,Many people have seen the story of a 10-year-old girl in Ohio was and then forced to flee the state to receive a safe abortion.,36,,
105,0.97,603.269,614.58,Storieslike this really underscore why it's so important for Seattle to stand in solidarity with people in other states seeking or providing this basic Healthcare right.,36,,
106,0.97,614.58,636.702,"Even though thousands of people have protested against this attack, over 5000 people have signed a petition in support of Councilmember Sawant's legislation trying to acknowledge no other Council member has come out to support this public legislation, like others have said executive actions don't carry the weight of law they can be undone on a whim just as Roe versus wade was.",36,,
107,0.97,636.702,644.443,These executive orders are not an excuse for city council Democrats do not support Councilmember Sawant's bill.,36,,
108,0.97,644.443,647.48,Our next Speaker is Jordan.,37,,

111,0.97,659.692,662.728,I speak in favor of Councilmember Sawant's resolution making Seattle and abortion rights sanctuary.,38,,
112,0.97,662.728,682.214,The recent overturning of a long standing President guaranteeing the rights to an abortion is nothing less than a gross Miscarriage of justice and a broken Federal judicial system now controlled by Senators from tiny States and past Presidents who lost the popular vote.,38,,
113,0.97,682.214,693.993,"This terrible decision will disproportionately impact women of color, poor women and concedes ground to racism and Sexism.",38,,
114,0.97,693.993,704.97,"As a Healthcare professional who often SEES women during pregnancy, it is self-evident to me that the medical decisions a woman makes about her own body and the social, psychological and economic implications of giving birth are hers and hers alone to make.",38,,
115,0.97,704.97,709.642,Seattle needs to make a stand and protect women who are seeking refuge from States that have since denied this right.,38,,
116,0.97,709.642,710.242,Thank you.,38,,
117,0.97,710.242,713.446,Our next Speaker is Kristin.,39,,

120,0.97,732.498,739.905,It is Page-Year-Old girl oppression white supremacy Ablest genocide and Ageist totalitarianism.,40,,
121,0.97,739.905,745.778,"In no way, shape or form is it Left-Wing or feminist.",40,,
122,0.97,745.778,749.782,It is the mass killing of young human beings and Exportation of their mothers.,40,,
123,0.97,749.782,756.355,People don't go skipping down to the clinic happy to do it.,40,,
124,0.97,756.355,773.806,"They are doing when they are manipulated into believing they have no other choice but to abort because they are told they can't be mothers if they are single, poor, teenagers, going to school, have careers or want lives worth living.",40,,
125,0.97,773.806,776.876,Abortion is not a solution to our problems.,40,,
126,0.97,776.876,785.184,It is a fake Band-Aid that acts like it does something to help us when in reality all it doesn't kill our children and leave us in the same situation we were previously in but this time with loads of Ptsd.,40,,
127,0.97,785.184,787.82,W deserve a Seattle that is a sanctuary city for the Pre- born.,40,,
128,0.97,787.82,791.69,Don't turn Seattle into a child genocide camp.,40,,
129,0.97,791.69,795.327,"We need to be better for women, pregnant people and children.",40,,

135,0.97,817.483,818.484,This is a labor issue.,42,,
136,0.97,818.484,828.627,I urge all the Democrats on city Council to support Councilmember Sawant's legislation to make Seattle and abortion sanctuary city.,42,,
137,0.97,828.627,850.783,"Alongside labor Union, Lgbt acute rights activists, Councilmember Sawant has introduced abortion sanctuary city legislation . We cannot rely on executive orders of the governor or Mayor to protect our rights.",42,,
138,0.97,850.783,854.253,"We need codification at the local level, just like we desperately need it at the Federal level.",42,,
139,0.97,854.253,863.596,"The Criminalization of women and people, their doctors and care providers and anyone who aids and Abets abortion means thousands will be forced to flee their home States to escape prosecution and jail time.",42,,
140,0.97,863.596,866.832,Support Councilmember Sawant's abortion sanctuary legislation.,42,,

143,0.97,885.517,888.387,My students were vocally upset to see their rights rollback.,44,,
144,0.97,888.387,900.633,They can see the right-wing onslaught and they are rightly worried about prosecution of Trans people and lots of Lgbtq freedom.,44,,
145,0.97,900.633,905.838,They are being let down by Democrats of had an opportunity to codify these rights in recent history in over the last few weeks have failed.,44,,
146,0.97,905.838,918.017,We need an independent fight back starting with making Seattle a sanctuary city for people around the country facing prosecution from Antiabortion laws especially young people and working-class people moving across the state line.,44,,
147,0.97,918.017,926.992,This legislation will use the same approach as the 2003 initiative to [Indiscernible] we know it can work.,44,,
148,0.97,926.992,932.665,I urge you to support the legislation and move weekly.,44,,

155,0.97,973.872,1002.935,"The same thing is true of workers at Google who do not receive benefits, do not receive the ability for coverage of their abortion and will be facing huge financial costs to do so in the very least we can do is instead of depending a corporation school the right thing and then threaten the rights behind our backs, is to fight and allow our city to be Sanctuaries for abortions.",46,,

338,0.97,2363.094,2375.473,I think we should see the plan before we give the status on colleges planning to build housing.,99,,

340,0.97,2384.382,2388.052,"But, this is a big lever on how and what is done.",99,,
341,0.97,2388.052,2403.934,"If you do not give the minor status before you find out what the plan is, the city will probably have a lot more leverage to get a good plan out of the college.",99,,
342,0.97,2403.934,2412.843,This is not very good policy to give away the store before you start the negotiating.,99,,
343,0.97,2412.843,2419.35,The other thing I fear is that the college doesn't really have to own what they are building because they can have a partner.,99,,
344,0.97,2419.35,2430.528,"Now, most of you don't remember it Seattle almost lost the Pike place market on one of these deals.",99,,

359,0.97,2541.238,2556.854,"And to respond to the concerns about the potential for hazards, there is a robust public process that would follow approval of this bill.",103,,
360,0.97,2556.854,2558.489,A minor amendment does not involve no process.,103,,
361,0.97,2558.489,2569.667,"There will still be citizens advisory committee meetings staffed by the Department of neighborhoods, there will still be an interpretation decision by the Seattle Department of construction and inspection and that will be followed by master use permit application and political process.",103,,

416,0.97,2823.487,2831.428,It is item number one.,112,,
417,0.97,2831.428,2836.934,"So, if you can hear me, first I'd like to give some background.",113,,
418,0.97,2836.934,2848.912,The resolution 32056 would adopt city lights 2023 through 2028 strategic plan and endorse the associated great pass.,113,,
419,0.97,2848.912,2866.23,"By background, I want to explain that the disruption of the pandemic in 2020 interrupted the expected update the city late strategic plan and Repast.",113,,
420,0.97,2866.23,2872.936,"In recognition of the Economics due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the executive did not transmit and Council did not take up rate setting legislation during 2020.",113,,
421,0.97,2872.936,2881.812,In 2021 Council approved rates for 2021 and 2022 and they were effective in April 2021.,113,,
422,0.97,2881.812,2895.259,"So, differing from regular practice, city light proposed and Council adopted a Five- year, not a six-year, strategic plan for 2022 through 2026.",113,,
423,0.97,2895.259,2913.844,"Now in 2022, city light has proposed a 2023 through 2028 strategic plan starting by the normal two year cycle of planning and rate path determination and rate change adoption.",113,,
424,0.97,2913.844,2924.721,"Because only one year has passed since the adoption of the previous plan, city light characterizes the 2028 plan is in update rather than a new plan.",113,,
425,0.97,2924.721,2928.392,We have before us has been approved by the city light review panel.,113,,
426,0.97,2928.392,2932.396,And unanimously passed out of committee last Wednesday.,113,,
427,0.97,2932.396,2933.864,Thank you.,114,,
428,0.97,2933.864,2943.64,Are there any other comments or questions regarding this?,114,,
429,0.97,2943.64,2944.741,"Thank you, Council President.",115,,
430,0.97,2944.741,2959.056,"The resolution approved last year, 32007 scheduled electricity rates to increase by 3.8% in 2023 and by another 3.8% in 2024.",115,,
431,0.97,2959.056,2971.668,"City lights resolution before us is asking the Council to increase rates by a higher amount, 4.5% in 2023 and another 4.5% in 2024.",115,,
432,0.97,2971.668,2973.37,I appreciate the hard work city late does.,115,,
433,0.97,2973.37,2975.272,I appreciate the thoughtful rationale for the utilities proposal.,115,,
434,0.97,2975.272,2985.649,Consistent with my comments on changes and rate increases have communicated to my constituents I will be voting no on today's resolution.,115,,
435,0.97,2985.649,2987.084,Thank you.,116,,
436,0.97,2987.084,2990.487,"Is there any other comments, Councilmember Sawant?",116,,
437,0.97,2990.487,2996.226,Thank you.,117,,
438,0.97,2996.226,3002.733,"As I have done in previous years, I will vote yes on this legislation approving Seattle city light strategic plan.",117,,
439,0.97,3002.733,3008.205,It accurately analyzes what resources city light will need to continue it's important work.,117,,
440,0.97,3008.205,3018.982,"However as I've said in previous years, I also agree that working people who are now facing punishing inflation shouldn't be asked to pay any rate increases.",117,,
441,0.97,3018.982,3023.453,Instead Seattle should be increasing the rates on that big business.,117,,
442,0.97,3023.453,3039.069,"For that reason, while I am voting yes on the strategic plan, I intend to vote no on rate increase legislation as long as it continues to put the voter those increases ash",117,,
443,0.97,3039.069,3040.871,Any other comments or concerns?,118,,
444,0.97,3040.871,3043.473,,119,,
445,0.97,3043.473,3044.574,May have closing comments?,120,,
446,0.97,3044.574,3046.81,I was just going to do that.,121,,
447,0.97,3046.81,3048.178,Go ahead.,121,,
448,0.97,3048.178,3054.918,I do want to acknowledge Councilmember Pedersen's historic knowledge.,122,,
449,0.97,3054.918,3059.99,I really appreciate that you have that perspective coming in to this year's vote.,122,,
450,0.97,3059.99,3072.202,It is true we are talking about a .7% increase from what was anticipated to be the 2023 rate increase to what is actually proposed in this plan.,122,,
451,0.97,3072.202,3078.275,I just wanted to explain a little about what is behind that.,122,,
452,0.97,3078.275,3089.453,City light developed the average rate for 2023 by including inflationary costs from 2021 and 2022 that were not included in city lights operations and maintenance budget for those years.,122,,
453,0.97,3089.453,3101.598,"In addition to that, the inflationary adjustment from 2020--2022 through 2023 is a significant driver.",122,,
454,0.97,3101.598,3117.848,"Right now the inflation is anticipated--the current projection is I believe, 7.8 and when that last plan was adopted, the projection was 5.1.",122,,
455,0.97,3117.848,3121.551,"So, that is a significant driver.",122,,
456,0.97,3121.551,3141.271,"And also, it is noted in the report, and I want to make clear that people watching the snow that city light makes claim that the annual increases of the proposed rate path falls short of anticipated inflation in costs going forward.",122,,
457,0.97,3141.271,3152.849,They are absorbing some of the higher than usual inflationary costs.,122,,
458,0.97,3152.849,3159.489,"In the past two years for example, some of those cost increases when it comes to city lights costs steel, aluminum and copper increased 70% to 80%.",122,,
459,0.97,3159.489,3161.791,Conduit 33%.,122,,
460,0.97,3161.791,3164.261,Those are the sorts of things they are grappling with.,122,,
461,0.97,3164.261,3172.068,"And to Councilmember Sawant's point, many people lost their jobs.",122,,
462,0.97,3172.068,3189.786,"But, city light didn't turn off--did not close accounts and they are currently operating under $44.7 million in Arrearages.",122,,
463,0.97,3189.786,3197.527,"Acknowledge Councilmember Pedersen's concern, but, I ask for my colleague support of this plan.",122,,
464,0.97,3197.527,3207.504,I think what is most important is really what is going on in the pocketbooks of city light.,122,,
465,0.97,3207.504,3215.111,Actually the actual rates in 2023 to 24 it supported will be slightly lower.,122,,
466,0.97,3215.111,3218.014,At 11.4 cents per kilowatt hour.,122,,
467,0.97,3218.014,3224.12,Compared to the anticipated 11.49 cents per kilowatt hour.,122,,
468,0.97,3224.12,3225.755,Actually slower than anticipated.,122,,
469,0.97,3225.755,3236.933,This is because a lower than anticipated power administration passed through cost.,122,,
470,0.97,3236.933,3240.337,That cost is also lower.,122,,
471,0.97,3240.337,3250.08,"Anyway, like I say, I ask for consideration of these issues as we go forward for a vote today.",122,,
472,0.97,3250.08,3256.186,I'm have went to quickly for closing remarks.,123,,
473,0.97,3256.186,3261.291,I saw Councilmember Mosqueda and Councilmember Strauss have remarks.,123,,
474,0.97,3261.291,3267.564,I'm going to allow Councilmember Strauss and Councilmember Mosqueda to respond.,123,,
475,0.97,3267.564,3270.834,If you want to respond again I will give you the opportunity.,123,,
476,0.97,3270.834,3271.468,Councilmember Mosqueda.,123,,
477,0.97,3271.468,3273.103,Thank you.,124,,
478,0.97,3273.103,3289.619,"I want to underscore some of the things that my colleagues spoke about today echoing what Councilmember Sawant has said about a more progressive rate structure, that is something I also worked on in 2018 and 2019 after taking the helm at City light.",124,,
479,0.97,3289.619,3306.536,I know Councilmember Pedersen has raised concerns about the impact on the rate as well and he and I had worked on utility discount programs trying to push and move toward an automatic enrollment for utility discount programs over the last two years.,124,,
480,0.97,3306.536,3315.779,Much appreciated that Seattle city light is taking steps on the discount program and moving toward what I call auto enrollment.,124,,
481,0.97,3315.779,3326.289,But I just wanted to bring up the Long-Standing desire to be a more progressive rate structure and underscore some of the points to need to see that in the future.,124,,
482,0.97,3326.289,3342.972,"I also think that as we look to maybe codify some of the things that have made it easier for some of our community members who've been hardest hit by Covid, one of the things we have done is, for example, waive the design review for affordable housing.",124,,
483,0.97,3342.972,3350.88,What affordable housing has said to us is they also want to see the utility hookups cost the wave.,124,,
484,0.97,3350.88,3369.766,"I will be voting yes for the strategic plan but as we think about how we strategic plan to address the hardship that has been worsened by Covid, a more progressive rate structure, auto enrollment in the utility discount programs and making sure we are waiving utility hookups for affordable housing would be policies that I know there is shared interest for on this Council.",124,,
485,0.97,3369.766,3375.271,"With that, I will vote yes for this and I look forward to the future conversations.",124,,
486,0.97,3375.271,3377.407,Councilmember Strauss.,125,,
487,0.97,3377.407,3380.744,Thank you.,126,,
488,0.97,3380.744,3389.452,"Apologies, I didn't mean to take the last word from Councilmember Nelson.",126,,
489,0.97,3389.452,3391.321,As she was speaking it made me sick of questions.,126,,

491,0.97,3400.864,3401.664,That is correct.,127,,
492,0.97,3401.664,3417.313,"In the two hardest years that we have seen in a long time, city light did not increase rates . with that understanding, wouldn't it be true that these rates are less then we could Expensed much higher rate increases.",128,,

813,0.97,4776.671,4783.612,This addresses a technical issue from the 2017 accountability ordinance which didn't address the complaints the named the chief of police should be addressed.,312,,

823,0.97,4889.217,4893.488,There are four civilian personnel at the OPA now.,312,,

835,0.97,4949.344,4964.592,"This administration is largely technical establishing Timelines and notification requirements for investigations while maintaining the current accountability system of the OPA, and establishment.",314,,
836,0.97,4964.592,4976.338,This is a system that has completely failed to hold the Seattle police Department Acountable for their response to the black lives matter movement of 2020 with billowing clouds of tear gas and pepper spray.,314,,
837,0.97,4976.338,4987.115,This is a system that is designed to Condone when officers kill in their own home because she made the mistake of calling the police.,314,,
838,0.97,4987.115,5004.132,"What we need is a community oversight board with full powers to investigate complaints against the police including the police chief, not for the reliance on the OPA and other entities of the current accountability structures.",314,,

866,0.97,5059.621,5062.624,That concludes the eight committee reports listed on the agenda.,337,,
867,0.97,5062.624,5069.23,"With that, we moved to items removed from the consent calendar.",337,,
868,0.97,5069.23,5070.198,There were none removed.,337,,
869,0.97,5070.198,5079.073,"Going to section J of the agenda, adoption of other resolutions.",337,,
870,0.97,5079.073,5080.975,Not seeing any other resolutions for Introdution and adoption today.,337,,

873,0.97,5088.416,5091.319,Thank you.,338,,
874,0.97,5091.319,5096.224,I would like to raise a point of order as it relates to the IRC.,338,,
875,0.97,5096.224,5107.969,"I did not make any motions to amend the IRC because I was just discovering the irregularity as it relates to Council rules, sort of in real time.",338,,
876,0.97,5107.969,5132.127,"But I just want to alert us all that Council in the Council rules has a relatively new rule passed last December that when a bill is being referred directly to full Council and circumventing the committee with jurisdiction, that there is a process in the Council bill rules that needs to be followed.",338,,
877,0.97,5132.127,5136.03,So I just want to flag that that process wasn't followed in this case.,338,,
878,0.97,5136.03,5167.095,"As a supporter of Councilmember Sawant's bill relating to the limitations on local law enforcement from cooperating in investigations or enforcing warrants, against people who are either seeking abortions or who have performed abortions, and supportive of that bill.",338,,
879,0.97,5167.095,5169.564,I would've liked the opportunity to consider having it in my committee.,338,,
880,0.97,5169.564,5170.131,Thank you.,338,,
881,0.97,5170.131,5174.002,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold . Councilmember Sawant, did you want to respond?",339,,
882,0.97,5174.002,5183.745,"I'm sorry, the process was the Council President is supposed to consult with committee chair.",340,,
883,0.97,5183.745,5185.38,I heard you.,341,,
884,0.97,5185.38,5191.052,Is there anything else?,341,,
885,0.97,5191.052,5191.452,All right.,341,,
886,0.97,5191.452,5199.027,"Not seeing anything else, before we moved to adjourn,--Councilmember Nelson.",341,,
887,0.97,5199.027,5199.594,I saw your hand.,341,,
888,0.97,5199.594,5214.709,I just wanted to let the viewing public no that Council's on this legislation I think it was yesterday or perhaps Friday when it was put on the IRC.,342,,
889,0.97,5214.709,5220.515,"And so, is not that we are failing to act, it is just now before us.",342,,
890,0.97,5220.515,5221.316,Thank you.,343,,
891,0.97,5221.316,5222.283,Councilmember Sawant?,343,,
892,0.97,5222.283,5239.434,"I was not actually going to speak but in response to Councilmember Herbold, yes, as Councilmember Herbold correctly indicated this is not something I would determine, it's from the Council President office.",344,,
893,0.97,5239.434,5251.613,"So I would say that the Council rules say bills referred directly to the city Council, I mean, they should talk to the committee chair that it would otherwise have gone to.",344,,
894,0.97,5251.613,5261.589,"But I would say that this bill, I don't know that it has a very obvious home in terms of the way the committee designations exist.",344,,
895,0.97,5261.589,5264.959,It makes sense to me what the Council President has done.,344,,
896,0.97,5264.959,5273.134,Great.,345,,
897,0.97,5273.134,5273.468,Right.,345,,
898,0.97,5273.468,5274.369,I want to directly respond.,345,,
899,0.97,5274.369,5283.511,"Sometimes when we get these matters, I have to do a balancing test and Councilmember Sawant and her staff and our staff made a decision and it would be on the calendar next week.",345,,
900,0.97,5283.511,5291.552,This is legislation we have seen in--and Councilmember Sawant had been discussing.,345,,
901,0.97,5291.552,5293.221,And we heard a lot from public comments today.,345,,
902,0.97,5293.221,5297.892,It has been timely since the Dobbs decision was to 24th.,345,,
903,0.97,5297.892,5304.198,Sometimes important decisions that people are not happy with but I would say it's nothing personal.,345,,
904,0.97,5304.198,5307.068,Trying to move the calendar forward and accommodate people's needs before we go on recess.,345,,
905,0.97,5307.068,5314.142,"That being said, all right.",345,,
906,0.97,5314.142,5314.976,I will start again.,345,,
907,0.97,5314.976,5317.345,"Our next regular scheduled meeting is Tuesday, July 25.",345,,
908,0.97,5317.345,5318.212,At 2:00.,345,,
909,0.97,5318.212,5319.947,I hope you all have a wonderful afternoon.,345,,
910,0.97,5319.947,5321.249,We are adjourned.,345,,
911,0.97,5321.249,5327.288,"Thank you, everybody.",345,,
