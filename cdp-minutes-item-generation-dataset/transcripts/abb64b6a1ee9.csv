17,0.97,35415.546,35415.88,Good morning.,10,,
18,0.97,35415.88,35423.921,Thank you for being here today for the first meeting of this select Committee on Seattle transportation benefit district funding.,10,,
19,0.97,35423.921,35435.066,"Allow me to use opening remarks as chair to highlight the purpose of the committee, schedule initial support for Stakeholders and initial thoughts on funding.",10,,
20,0.97,35435.066,35449.68,For the benefit of the general public Council member Gonzalez established this committee of nine Council members so we can put in front of voters the opportunity to renew the funding that's expiring for our successful Seattle transportation benefit district.,10,,
21,0.97,35449.68,35458.523,"As we know, a benefit district is a key tool Washington state law provides to cities to raise money for transportation needs.",10,,
22,0.97,35458.523,35468.9,"Seattle has consistently focused our benefit district on supplementing bus service, providing free transit passes to those in need, providing other transit solutions.",10,,
23,0.97,35468.9,35470.902,"Thankfully, that's the proposal before us today.",10,,
24,0.97,35470.902,35477.775,Today we'll have an overview of the Seattle transportation benefit district and the proposal to renew the funding.,10,,
25,0.97,35477.775,35490.087,"In addition to hearing from our city's transportation officials, all of our meetings will include the own central staff expert on transportation Calvin chow.",10,,
26,0.97,35490.087,35492.69,"At the end, Council members can of course ask questions.",10,,
27,0.97,35492.69,35499.664,"You can send questions directly to our central staff for later, Calvin chow.",10,,
28,0.97,35499.664,35506.938,Regarding the schedule we will meet again July 17 at 10:00 to discuss and vote on amendments.,10,,
29,0.97,35506.938,35512.977,Please send ideas for amendments to central staff analyst Calvin chow early next week.,10,,
30,0.97,35512.977,35519.05,The goal is for us as full city Council to vote on final measure by Monday July 27.,10,,
31,0.97,35519.05,35529.126,That's because the deadline is August 4 to put this funding source on to the November ballot for voters to consider.,10,,
32,0.97,35529.126,35552.116,"The press release sent to the media Tuesday when the Mayor transmitted draft legislation to us included support from a broad coalition of Stakeholders, Mlk labor Council, urban League, ATU local 587, transportation choices coalition, downtown Seattle Association, rooted in rights, our transportation equity Workgroup.",10,,
33,0.97,35552.116,35561.125,I expect we'll hear public comment today that expresses common ground in wanting to provide more transit service and more funding for transit.,10,,
34,0.97,35561.125,35572.937,"I believe we have options, we have several options without needing to drastically amend the legislation before us but we can talk about that later today.",10,,
35,0.97,35572.937,35590.621,"If we successfully overturn initiative 976 in the courts, I- 976 we can immediately restore the $20 vehicle license fees and I will personally support doubling this revenue source immediately to $40, which we are allowed to do with our own authority.",10,,
36,0.97,35590.621,35602.633,At most I am interested in pursuing additional funding with King to expand transit and making progress on the collaboration we had during or before the pandemic struck.,10,,
37,0.97,35602.633,35613.844,Moving forward to preserve this Seattle funding for transit today does not prevent us from doing more across our region with transit partners at King County.,10,,
38,0.97,35613.844,35618.616,The ordinance as introduced explicitly caused for the cooperation to expand transit throughout our County.,10,,
39,0.97,35618.616,35633.397,To wrap up these remarks let me say I personally believe we must provide Seattle with the option to renew successful transportation benefit district before it expires.,10,,
40,0.97,35633.397,35634.498,"Benefit district's essential, affordable, green.",10,,
41,0.97,35634.498,35639.804,"Our economy, workers, Ãšenvironment are counting on us to preserve basic transit services.",10,,
42,0.97,35639.804,35645.142,Continuing this small tax is necessary as our economy reopens.,10,,
43,0.97,35645.142,35656.587,"We preserve transit subsidies seniors, students, and to be sure buses get people everywhere they need to go which includes boosting transit access to and from West Seattle.",10,,
44,0.97,35656.587,35669.367,"We look forward to working with Council colleagues, community Stakeholders, constituents, transportation on this vital transit measure.",10,,
45,0.97,35669.367,35672.203,Thank you for allowing me opening remarks and let's go to public comment.,10,,
46,0.97,35672.203,35675.373,At this time we will open remote public comment period.,10,,
47,0.97,35675.373,35683.714,I ask that everyone please be patient as we learn to operate this new system in real time and navigate through inevitable growing pains.,10,,
48,0.97,35683.714,35693.858,We are continuously looking for ways to fine tune the process and adding features to allow for additional means of public participation in Council meetings.,10,,
49,0.97,35693.858,35702.733,It remains strong intent of city Council to have public comment regularly included on meeting Agendas.,10,,
50,0.97,35702.733,35710.307,City Council reserves the right to modify these at any point if we deem the system is being abused.,10,,
51,0.97,35710.307,35714.311,I will moderate in the following manner.,10,,
52,0.97,35714.311,35717.415,We've got about 14 people signed up.,10,,
53,0.97,35717.415,35719.95,We will make the comment period 30 minutes.,10,,
54,0.97,35719.95,35722.353,Each Speaker will be given two minutes to speak.,10,,
55,0.97,35722.353,35728.592,I will call on two speakers at a time and in the order registered on the Council's Website.,10,,
56,0.97,35728.592,35743.207,"If you have not had a chance to register to speak but would like to, you can sign up before the end of the public comment period by going to the Website Seattle.Governor/Council.",10,,
57,0.97,35743.207,35746.877,The link for public comment is also on today's agenda.,10,,
58,0.97,35746.877,35758.322,"Once I call a name, staff will Unmute the appropriate microphone and automatic prompt of you have been Unmuted will be the Speaker's Cue that it is their turn to speak.",10,,
59,0.97,35758.322,35762.46,Please begin by stating your name and item you are addressing.,10,,
60,0.97,35762.46,35765.996,Public comment should relate to an item on today's agenda.,10,,
61,0.97,35765.996,35768.766,Speakers will hear a Chime when ten seconds are left.,10,,
62,0.97,35768.766,35778.375,If speakers do not end the comments at the end of the allotted time the microphone will be muted to allow us to call the next Speaker.,10,,
63,0.97,35778.375,35787.051,"Once you have completed, Disconnect from the line and if you continue to plan to follow the meeting, do so the Seattle channel or listening option on the agenda.",10,,
64,0.97,35787.051,35792.089,The public comment period is open and we will begin with the first two speakers on the list.,10,,
65,0.97,35792.089,35803.634,I'd like to hear from first from Anna from rooted and rights and then Ryan Packer.,10,,
66,0.97,35803.634,35804.869,"Go ahead, Anna.",10,,
67,0.97,35804.869,35805.136,Great.,11,,
68,0.97,35805.136,35805.302,Hi.,11,,
69,0.97,35805.302,35810.875,"I am program director of rooted in rights, part of disability rights Washington.",11,,
70,0.97,35810.875,35824.155,We support additional funding for transit but want to encourage Council to try to have ways to have Spdd support the region as we know we need to be funding public transit on a regional if not statewide basis.,11,,
71,0.97,35824.155,35835.332,"It is plummeted in the pandemic and there are areas in our city, areas in our County where poor Brown, black, immigrant folks live that are still heavily reliant.",11,,
72,0.97,35835.332,35840.271,We need to be sure those of us who are transit dependent can get where we need to go.,11,,
73,0.97,35840.271,35849.513,We need to be sure transit is serving the areas of higher need even if they are not within the city of Seattle.,11,,
74,0.97,35849.513,35852.817,The growth has priced many out of the borders of our city.,11,,
75,0.97,35852.817,35861.358,As we talk about the importance of equity we must do everything possible to Prioritize service to the areas of greatest needs.,11,,
76,0.97,35861.358,35870.301,I know there are constraints but we challenge you to find ways to expand passes for high Chool students and all students within the county.,11,,
77,0.97,35870.301,35884.348,Imagine in four years when you decide to go to voters to support a county wide measure how tremendous it would be to have support of our youth who have had access in our region to free transit passes.,11,,
78,0.97,35884.348,35884.882,Thank you.,11,,
79,0.97,35884.882,35886.15,"Thank you, Anna.",12,,
80,0.97,35886.15,35891.822,Next is Ryan Packer followed by Annie wise.,12,,
81,0.97,35891.822,35892.523,"Go ahead, Ryan.",12,,
82,0.97,35892.523,35894.758,Thank you.,13,,
83,0.97,35894.758,35897.061,My name is Ryan Packer.,13,,
84,0.97,35897.061,35904.902,Transit benefit district proposal released by the Mayor is way short of what we need to do to achieve continued success.,13,,
85,0.97,35904.902,35914.545,Seattle's transit rider ship has bucked national trend of declining rider ship not as a fluke but because we have invested in it.,13,,
86,0.97,35914.545,35918.749,78 routes last year received some transit benefit district funding.,13,,
87,0.97,35918.749,35928.225,"This would cut the funding by 80%, which is setting it up for failure.",13,,
88,0.97,35928.225,35939.77,"As a context, the proposed 50,000 service hours per year would not even be enough to continue the increased service on just two of the routes.",13,,
89,0.97,35939.77,35940.771,C line and D line.,13,,
90,0.97,35940.771,35946.543,To say nothing of the other 76.,13,,
91,0.97,35946.543,35974.872,"The Council should consider finding general fund offsets for programs like Orca opportunity so the District funds transit and they should consider additional revenue options to get us to the 350,000 service hours per year within the next couple years by the time that Precovid transit rider ship rebounds.",13,,
92,0.97,35974.872,35975.172,Thank you.,13,,
93,0.97,35975.172,35977.741,"Thank you, Ryan.",14,,

95,0.97,35982.88,35984.281,Go ahead Annie.,14,,
96,0.97,35984.281,35985.382,Good morning Council members.,15,,
97,0.97,35985.382,35993.857,"My name is Annie wise and I am operations director at Mlk labor, an organization that represents over 100,000 Union workers.",15,,
98,0.97,35993.857,35999.63,We have a long history of supporting transit measures similar.,15,,
99,0.97,35999.63,36006.637,I want to voice my support as a local avid public transit rider.,15,,
100,0.97,36006.637,36015.546,Climate crisis necessities we take action which includes a shift to using low carbon methods of transportation and resisting urge to drive solo whenever possible.,15,,
101,0.97,36015.546,36019.116,This can happen by ensuring public transit is reliable and frequent.,15,,
102,0.97,36019.116,36033.63,I have worked in downtown Seattle for ten years and I am proud to stand with transportation choices coalition and other transit advocates to ensure folks like myself can continue to work and thrive in the city.,15,,
103,0.97,36033.63,36038.102,Thanks for your time.,15,,
104,0.97,36038.102,36041.638,Thank you.,16,,
105,0.97,36041.638,36045.409,Next is Joe Kinsler followed by Rachel.,16,,
106,0.97,36045.409,36046.477,Go ahead Joe.,16,,
107,0.97,36046.477,36048.078,Thank you.,17,,
108,0.97,36048.078,36050.647,It's a pleasure to be back in front of you today.,17,,
109,0.97,36050.647,36066.33,"I want to stress this morning that we do need to, I really appreciate the chairman saying he would bring back the car tabs, when you think of the great leadership of the will and Seattle city attorney.",17,,
110,0.97,36066.33,36069.199,It's important that we have a network of bus lines.,17,,
111,0.97,36069.199,36073.937,I agree with Strauss that we need to get the bus links done.,17,,
112,0.97,36073.937,36099.663,We should call them Heidi lanes after the hero who brought the U pass about which gave birth to the new Yorker but we should also not just have the Heidi Lane but also another Lane in Seattle and other lanes for all the heroes of public transit and bus Lane network.,17,,
113,0.97,36099.663,36112.443,I think it would be a great use of car tab money to pay for building the bus lanes because it helps move traffic as well.,17,,
114,0.97,36112.443,36119.483,I just really have hopeful that this does pass.,17,,
115,0.97,36119.483,36123.921,The car tabs and the big wins for Metro.,17,,
116,0.97,36123.921,36126.657,It's one of the best in the world.,17,,
117,0.97,36126.657,36133.831,It's good to hear the deputy Mayor on the call.,17,,
118,0.97,36133.831,36137.534,I wish her well.,17,,
119,0.97,36137.534,36142.473,Thank you.,18,,
120,0.97,36142.473,36145.108,Go ahead Rachel Ludwick.,18,,
121,0.97,36145.108,36146.477,Hi.,19,,
122,0.97,36146.477,36147.644,I live in beacon Hill.,19,,
123,0.97,36147.644,36154.118,I want to count on the benefit district currently going overwhelmingly to service hours.,19,,
124,0.97,36154.118,36160.591,We started paying for her things with this tax money because Metra couldn't keep up.,19,,
125,0.97,36160.591,36165.162,Now Metra will be cutting things and I want us to focus on service hours.,19,,
126,0.97,36165.162,36175.973,This is planning to spend only like 30% on service hours and instead spend on other things.,19,,
127,0.97,36175.973,36182.546,Will necessarily be more equitable than paying for more service hours.,19,,
128,0.97,36182.546,36185.315,People have Crappy transit now and it will get worse.,19,,
129,0.97,36185.315,36192.022,Will we build more for them or will it be for wealthy commuters downtown?,19,,
130,0.97,36192.022,36201.098,I think transit should be free for everyone but I don't think there is a point of free bus pass if there is not frequent transit.,19,,
131,0.97,36201.098,36201.498,Seattle can help.,19,,
132,0.97,36201.498,36208.138,That's inside the city and outside.,19,,
133,0.97,36208.138,36214.411,"People who are disabled and have a car, please focus on service hours first and not other things.",19,,
134,0.97,36214.411,36214.711,Thank you.,19,,
135,0.97,36214.711,36215.679,"Thank you, Rachel.",20,,
136,0.97,36215.679,36222.452,Next up is Matthew Lang followed by Alex Hudson.,21,,
137,0.97,36222.452,36222.886,Go ahead Matthew.,21,,
138,0.97,36222.886,36224.688,Hi there.,22,,
139,0.97,36224.688,36225.889,My name is Matthew Lang.,22,,
140,0.97,36225.889,36230.894,I am lead Organizer of the transit riders Union.,22,,
141,0.97,36230.894,36238.335,We are disappointed by the very small amount of funding for transit service.,22,,
142,0.97,36238.335,36243.907,The amount that's being Leveed here is not enough.,22,,
143,0.97,36243.907,36251.682,"80,000 hours is not going to fill the need.",22,,
144,0.97,36251.682,36265.929,"While the reliance on frequency is important in a normal time, we need to be thinking about our essential workers who might be working night shifts who don't have access to transit right now.",22,,
145,0.97,36265.929,36274.304,I heard a story about a person who had to walk an hour in Aurora because they didn't have night service.,22,,
146,0.97,36274.304,36279.243,I am making sure that the measure focuses on that as important.,22,,
147,0.97,36279.243,36295.492,"We are concerned that as more people go back to commuting to work and riding transit generally, while there is continuing need to practice social distancing and limit the number of riders per coach, Seattle will need more transit, not less.",22,,
148,0.97,36295.492,36308.505,"Therefore it's concerning to us that transit service cuts are planned for this fall, more expected this year, next year.",22,,
149,0.97,36308.505,36317.781,We definitely understand that raising the bar to .2% sales tax would be a raise in tax.,22,,
150,0.97,36317.781,36328.125,At the same time we believe that Orca youth programs and access programs need to be funded and fully.,22,,
151,0.97,36328.125,36351.214,"So we should have the Council look into whether funds proposed for Maintainence can come from other sources, especially for pot holes and make sure we can take care of our transit riders, not just road maintenance.",22,,
152,0.97,36351.214,36351.982,Thank you.,23,,
153,0.97,36351.982,36358.889,Next is Alex Hudson followed by Daniel Helpner.,23,,
154,0.97,36358.889,36359.089,Alex.,23,,
155,0.97,36359.089,36359.69,Thank you.,24,,
156,0.97,36359.69,36365.529,I am executive director of transportation choices coalition.,24,,
157,0.97,36365.529,36370.5,Covid-19 pandemic has created obviously incredible challenges for people and estimated government budgets.,24,,
158,0.97,36370.5,36375.972,"As people who can stay home do so to stop the spread, rider ship has declined.",24,,
159,0.97,36375.972,36389.586,"However we wish to note that throughout the pandemic King County Metro has continued to serve people's mobility needs and the agency exceeds 125,000 trips a day, an upward trend that continues to rise.",24,,
160,0.97,36389.586,36409.206,"Despite all of these challenges, the need and benefit for public transit has remained a constant, and we see transit service as a must have for a functional equitable economy to address the climate crisis and to advance social justice and public safety.",24,,
161,0.97,36409.206,36417.247,We see this as a bridge to our ultimate goal.,24,,
162,0.97,36417.247,36422.586,This measure however is necessary to bolster transit service through this difficult time.,24,,
163,0.97,36422.586,36435.365,With the passage of 976 leaving governments with fewer tools to generate transit funding it is unfortunate reality that sales tax which is the only remaining viable tool.,24,,
164,0.97,36435.365,36441.872,We believe this attempts to balance aggressive nature of the sales tax and funding needed to keep transit moving.,24,,
165,0.97,36441.872,36450.847,However we must note that the package may not generate enough to meet the needs of transit riders in Seattle.,24,,
166,0.97,36450.847,36454.818,Gcc is committed to continue working with our partners to find revenue sources.,24,,
167,0.97,36454.818,36460.157,We ask that you continue to Recommit.,24,,
168,0.97,36460.157,36469.733,We appreciate the inclusion to this point and we ask that there be policy language supporting a shift and that planning begins promptly.,24,,
169,0.97,36469.733,36486.75,We ask that Council center equity through this process as they should be all processes and to ensure that the funds are benefiting those who have historically.,24,,
170,0.97,36486.75,36488.585,Thank you.,25,,
171,0.97,36488.585,36489.052,Appreciate it.,25,,
172,0.97,36489.052,36490.854,Thanks for your constant engagement on this.,25,,
173,0.97,36490.854,36496.293,We will be talking with you in the organization a lot.,25,,
174,0.97,36496.293,36500.997,Next we have Daniel Helpner.,25,,
175,0.97,36500.997,36502.732,Go ahead Daniel.,25,,
176,0.97,36502.732,36503.633,Hi there.,26,,
177,0.97,36503.633,36503.967,Good morning.,26,,
178,0.97,36503.967,36505.735,I am Daniel from district 6.,26,,
179,0.97,36505.735,36510.674,Over the past ten years Seattle has bucked the trend on transit rider ship and investment.,26,,
180,0.97,36510.674,36516.98,It's a direct result of the investment that they have bucked the trend on rider ship.,26,,
181,0.97,36516.98,36522.652,Dropping vehicle miles traveled was the biggest piece of progress towards climate goals over the last ten years.,26,,
182,0.97,36522.652,36528.258,It would be a tragedy to lose that by dropping investment into transit operations.,26,,
183,0.97,36528.258,36536.333,We need to continue investing in transit at the same level to make sure it continues to be available as our economy reopens.,26,,
184,0.97,36536.333,36545.075,We don't want people having to buy cars as they go back to work.,26,,
185,0.97,36545.075,36554.251,"Please find new progressive revenue sources or at last resort, possibly increased sales tax for the benefit district.",26,,
186,0.97,36554.251,36558.822,Also please remove Capitol expenditures from the spending plan as other people have mentioned.,26,,
187,0.97,36558.822,36566.796,In the current proposal we are doubling amount of funding for road maintenance to back reduced budget.,26,,
188,0.97,36566.796,36573.937,We don't have extra money to spend on filling pot holes when transit funding is inadequate.,26,,
189,0.97,36573.937,36581.144,Every dollar should be on transit operations and Orca Liftand youth Orca program.,26,,
190,0.97,36581.144,36581.878,Thank you.,26,,
191,0.97,36581.878,36584.915,Thank you very much.,27,,
192,0.97,36584.915,36594.724,Next is don blank followed by Hendrick dunk.,27,,
193,0.97,36594.724,36602.866,I am here to speak on behalf of the 1700 business nonprofit and resident members.,28,,
194,0.97,36602.866,36609.072,We understand the importance of Transportation for the vitality of our city and local economy.,28,,
195,0.97,36609.072,36624.654,As Alex mentioned earlier Covid- 19 has stressed our transit system and services and underscored the importance of maintaining a resilient transportation system that keeps people moving not only for the next few years but is built for the Longterm.,28,,
196,0.97,36624.654,36637.167,I am speaking to express our support for expanded transit access and important projects that strengthen by enhancing mobility and creating well paid jobs to support our city's economic recovery.,28,,
197,0.97,36637.167,36639.502,We need all options on the table.,28,,
198,0.97,36639.502,36646.343,Thank you for your leadership as we work together to keep Seattle working in the years ahead.,28,,
199,0.97,36646.343,36649.346,"Thank you, don.",29,,
200,0.97,36649.346,36656.62,Next is Hendrick followed by Brittney.,29,,
201,0.97,36656.62,36656.886,Go ahead.,29,,
202,0.97,36656.886,36657.12,Hi.,30,,
203,0.97,36657.12,36658.955,I am speaking from Capitol Hill.,30,,
204,0.97,36658.955,36672.969,I wanted to say the initial Seattle transit benefit district was a huge success and it's because of its investment in bus service that Seattle bucked national trends of dropping bus rider ship.,30,,
205,0.97,36672.969,36677.941,"Given that, I am concerned with the allocation of funds in the Mayor's proposal.",30,,
206,0.97,36677.941,36692.355,"The primary purpose should be to fund transit service and in particular fixing of pot holes which should be s DOT service, not something we are funding.",30,,
207,0.97,36692.355,36693.189,Road funding is already restricted.,30,,
208,0.97,36693.189,36698.395,Funds we use for road funding are already restricted to road funding.,30,,
209,0.97,36698.395,36705.368,We should not be allocating transit funding to those same needs.,30,,
210,0.97,36705.368,36721.351,I would argue other spending is--I would urge capital to Reallocate Capitol funds to transit infrastructure and towards transit service which will be an over 50% increase in that budget in the new proposal.,30,,
211,0.97,36721.351,36721.651,Thank you.,30,,
212,0.97,36721.651,36723.119,Thank you.,31,,
213,0.97,36723.119,36730.86,Next is Brittney Bolet followed by Darnel H.,31,,
214,0.97,36730.86,36734.898,"Good morning Council members, chair Pedersen.",32,,
215,0.97,36734.898,36742.038,First I would like to thank the city Council and the voters of Seattle for the continued commitment to funding transit.,32,,
216,0.97,36742.038,36747.01,We know how important it is to get this benefit district renewed.,32,,
217,0.97,36747.01,36749.412,A couple of improvements we would like to suggest.,32,,
218,0.97,36749.412,36762.192,First we would encourage you to concentrate as much funding as possible on the service hours and try to fund capital improvements elsewhere.,32,,
219,0.97,36762.192,36775.338,"Lends specifically to most transit dependent to people who work odd hours, people who cannot drive, people on the South end and areas already under served and who are already over burdened by environmental pollution.",32,,
220,0.97,36775.338,36783.747,We encourage you to raise the maximum revenue by a .2% sales tax increase.,32,,
221,0.97,36783.747,36803.099,We have to look at the options that we have available on the table and we consider that the benefit of higher tax rate will out weigh the unfortunate regrets of the source.,32,,
222,0.97,36803.099,36804.1,Thank you.,32,,
223,0.97,36804.1,36804.567,Thank you.,33,,
224,0.97,36804.567,36814.244,"It looks like Darnel is not present yet so we will go to the next Speaker, Robert.",33,,
225,0.97,36814.244,36814.777,Good morning.,34,,
226,0.97,36814.777,36818.948,I am a homeowner in district 6 and also on the board of the local club.,34,,
227,0.97,36818.948,36828.124,The pandemic is a reminder that we need to Proactively address problems before they become a crippling devastating crisis.,34,,
228,0.97,36828.124,36834.864,We cannot allow Coronavirus to make climate crisis worse especially in the period of economic distress.,34,,
229,0.97,36834.864,36839.536,"This is essential to recovery, essential to keeping people healthy.",34,,
230,0.97,36839.536,36844.574,I would encourage you to go as big as you can with your revenue.,34,,
231,0.97,36844.574,36856.186,"Again, it is not ideal that the option on the table is a Regressive sales tax increase but that's the problem with state Legislature.",34,,
232,0.97,36856.186,36858.388,We encourage .2% sales tax increment.,34,,
233,0.97,36858.388,36869.399,The difference between that and .1% is not big in the terms of revenue to people but could be significant in terms of the service it BUYS.,34,,
234,0.97,36869.399,36872.936,We need to restore and preserve as much as we can.,34,,
235,0.97,36872.936,36875.438,Going to the .2% helps us do that.,34,,
236,0.97,36875.438,36885.915,We need to move money out of capital road maintenance and bus service.,34,,
237,0.97,36885.915,36892.322,There are other sources of revenue to do things like filling pot holes.,34,,
238,0.97,36892.322,36900.763,"I would encourage you to go as big as you can and make sure the money is going into preserving bus hours, services, routes, frequency.",34,,
239,0.97,36900.763,36903.199,Thank you very much.,34,,
240,0.97,36903.199,36904.167,"Thank you, Robert.",35,,
241,0.97,36904.167,36910.874,That's all the speakers that we have that have registered.,35,,
242,0.97,36910.874,36924.787,"For those who are viewing, please E-mail us at Council @ Seattle.Gov . It will reach Online Council members.",35,,
243,0.97,36924.787,36928.057,Right now we are going to get to the items of business.,35,,
244,0.97,36928.057,36929.792,It's just the one item.,35,,
245,0.97,36929.792,36941.671,Will the clerk please read item one into the record.,35,,
246,0.97,36941.671,36948.011,Sale Department of transportation presentation and proposal for briefing and discussion.,36,,
247,0.97,36948.011,36951.147,"Thank you, clerk.",37,,
248,0.97,36951.147,36952.448,Appreciate that.,37,,
249,0.97,36952.448,36956.319,"Council members and the public, there are three items you can click into.",37,,
250,0.97,36956.319,36966.496,We are going to have the executive pull up and start to show their Powerpoint presentation.,37,,
251,0.97,36966.496,36970.333,There are only 14 slides so we will go through that and ask questions at the end.,37,,
252,0.97,36970.333,36979.742,There is also the memo written by our central staffer Calvin chow and then the draft Council bill itself.,37,,
253,0.97,36979.742,36986.149,"Regarding folks from the executive, thank you for taking the time.",37,,
254,0.97,36986.149,36990.119,Thank you for those who called in and to those who are watching.,37,,
255,0.97,36990.119,36990.687,We really appreciate that.,37,,
256,0.97,36990.687,36996.492,I turn it over to the deputy Mayor so you can introduce your team from the executive.,37,,
257,0.97,36996.492,36997.56,Good morning Council members.,38,,
258,0.97,36997.56,37000.63,Thank you for having us here today.,38,,
259,0.97,37000.63,37006.336,I will just kick this presentation off.,38,,
260,0.97,37006.336,37010.873,Once again it is the deputy Mayor for those listening on the phone.,38,,
261,0.97,37010.873,37031.828,"With me we have the teen of care Milan son, deputy director for policy Foremans at s DOT and Lauren Zana who is head of the transit and mobility division and also joining us is Elliot hem brick, the Mayor's policy adviser.",38,,
262,0.97,37031.828,37054.851,"I will kick offer by saying close to this time six years ago when I still worked at transportation choices coalition, a previous Council was putting the final touches on what was then an emergency transit measure to put on the ballot to stave off potential transit cuts through the loss of the King County region wide measure.",38,,
263,0.97,37054.851,37057.253,Obviously much has changed since then.,38,,
264,0.97,37057.253,37065.862,That investment that the Seattle voters approved so overwhelmingly six years ago has been Transformative for Seattle.,38,,
265,0.97,37065.862,37074.103,We have seen record rider ship as many of the folks who gave public comment provided.,38,,
266,0.97,37074.103,37084.881,We have seen just complete transformation of transit access in the city with the neighborhoods getting more frequent and reliable transit.,38,,
267,0.97,37084.881,37106.903,"We have also seen investments in the opportunity program which also supports the Seattle public school students to be able to take the bus to school and to other places, as well as the program that now currently serves low income residents at Seattle housing authority projects.",38,,
268,0.97,37106.903,37112.041,This has been a very Transformative measure.,38,,
269,0.97,37112.041,37121.651,"Honestly, it was my great pleasure last year as we began the planning for the measure, we were looking at a routine renewal.",38,,
270,0.97,37121.651,37125.888,976 was passed by other voters.,38,,
271,0.97,37125.888,37127.29,Seattle voters overwhelmingly rejected the initiative.,38,,
272,0.97,37127.29,37131.994,In some ways that began the series of events that's brought us here today.,38,,
273,0.97,37131.994,37144.04,What it did is it took away the $60 car tab that provided half or close to half of what transportation benefit district funded.,38,,
274,0.97,37144.04,37161.257,"Layered on top of that was of course, following that was the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and what we saw was a precipitous drop off in rider ship as we had Stay-Home orders.",38,,
275,0.97,37161.257,37171.033,Transit essentially became an essential service in many ways with transit drivers serving as first responders to get essential workers where they needed to go.,38,,
276,0.97,37171.033,37203.266,"I think layered on top of that, because 220 is the gift that keeps on giving, is we had lost the upper bridge of the West Seattle bridge creating a unique Connectivity challenge and more importantly creating sort of overflow into neighborhoods like Georgetown that have already been impacted by disproportionate air pollution impacts.",38,,
277,0.97,37203.266,37215.912,So what we have tried to put together as a transportation benefit district package for Council's consideration really focuses on a few important values.,38,,
278,0.97,37215.912,37224.12,The first value is that a transit very much is a core investment for the city of Seattle.,38,,
279,0.97,37224.12,37229.258,It is essential for the city's resiliency.,38,,
280,0.97,37229.258,37241.537,It is essential for continued prosperity and to create those connections for particularly in communities where transit is literally a life line.,38,,
281,0.97,37241.537,37261.09,So what we focused on is making sure that this package does center in on community where transit is to jobs as we particularly have challenges with folks being able to get to where they need to go.,38,,
282,0.97,37261.09,37268.564,"We have seen significant drop offs in rider ship region wide, Metro still continues to carry will 130,000 riders a day.",38,,
283,0.97,37268.564,37277.373,So I wanted to make sure we are making investments strategically.,38,,
284,0.97,37277.373,37277.873,Second is flexibility.,38,,
285,0.97,37277.873,37284.447,Being flexible and responsive to what are emerging mobility needs that have come upon us as a result of Covid-19.,38,,
286,0.97,37284.447,37294.223,The truth is I think this is a little bit--we continue to sort of walk in with some level of uncertainty.,38,,
287,0.97,37294.223,37305.835,How do we create a package that has enough flexibility in there to make sure that we are able to respond to emerging mobility needs as they come upon us.,38,,
288,0.97,37305.835,37313.709,The third value is how do we also make sure this is a prudent use of tax dollars.,38,,
289,0.97,37313.709,37329.525,"In the earlier Iteration of the transportation benefit district, we had challenges with the delivery of service and that is why transportation benefit district continued to evolve to support capital programs and opportunity.",38,,
290,0.97,37329.525,37347.243,"As we continue to work closely, Metra is a close partner of ours, we want to be sure that the service that the city is purchasing is not in glue of service that the county and Metra should be providing the city as part of the baseline service delivery.",38,,
291,0.97,37347.243,37355.618,How do we continue that partnership and make sure we are complementary to what Metra is doing system wide?,38,,
292,0.97,37355.618,37361.691,"Finally as several Commenters said, we see this measure very much as a bridge to a regional measure.",38,,
293,0.97,37361.691,37371.967,"If you recall the original genesis of the program was very much as a stop gap measure, right, until the county could develop a regional package.",38,,
294,0.97,37371.967,37379.942,Unfortunately we are not there yet but the Mayor remains committed.,38,,
295,0.97,37379.942,37380.71,He believes transit is regional.,38,,
296,0.97,37380.71,37397.693,Several Commenters pointed to the fact that displacement has resulted in more folks living in South County and how we create a robust transit network throughout the county where people can get where they need to go.,38,,
297,0.97,37397.693,37409.372,You heard from the public comment and from the press statements that there is a broad coalition in support of this from business to labor to community groups.,38,,
298,0.97,37409.372,37461.223,"I think that given where we are and given the opportunities both with future options to invest in in transit, particularly if we are successful in our challenge of 976 that will create the availability of additional options, I wanted to recognize that because of the economic uncertainty that we are walking into as a city and recognizing that the sales tax continues to be one of the most Regressive options available to us to be able to make investments, how do we balance those things but also create potential that when we sort of are on the up swing and continue to recover as a city and as a region that we have the tools available to us to be able to make those necessary investments in transit.",38,,
299,0.97,37461.223,37481.477,"At that point, I am going to hand it over to Karen who will give you a little bit of the background of how we got here and then walk through the specifics of the package.",38,,
300,0.97,37481.477,37484.88,That is.,39,,
301,0.97,37484.88,37485.414,This is Karen Melanson.,39,,
302,0.97,37485.414,37499.662,"If you just advance the slides, I will talk about the background on the prior measure, the measure that's expiring this year, the successes, and then we will move to the proposal.",39,,
303,0.97,37499.662,37511.64,"Earlier this week, the Mayor transmitted legislation Torr Seattle transportation benefit district or STBD that would maintain the .1% sales tax.",39,,
304,0.97,37511.64,37516.612,It is expected to generate between 20 and 30 million annually over six years.,39,,
305,0.97,37516.612,37524.687,"This will go to essential transit service, transit related capital projects, transit access programs like work opportunity.",39,,
306,0.97,37524.687,37535.431,"If approved by city Council, it will go before Seattle voters and with support access frequent reliable transit service.",39,,
307,0.97,37535.431,37552.615,"This measure ensures critical elements in bus routes, Seattle's transit network are maintained, that equitable access continues to be Prioritized and allows the city to scale up service as Seattle's transit rider ship recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic.",39,,
308,0.97,37552.615,37559.321,We want to take a moment to highlight some of the current programs' successes.,39,,
309,0.97,37559.321,37569.331,Seattle was the fastest growing big city in the country over the previous decade with the population growing by almost 24% since 2010.,39,,
310,0.97,37569.331,37574.637,Each new person in Seattle increases demand for convenient travel options across the city and the region.,39,,
311,0.97,37574.637,37584.613,"It is critical that every mode of Transportation is reliable, accessible, and affordable.",39,,
312,0.97,37584.613,37589.251,Our STBD played a significant role in making that possible.,39,,
313,0.97,37589.251,37598.627,Provided city with additional resources to have one of the highest rates of increased rider ship in the country.,39,,
314,0.97,37598.627,37606.569,The majority of urban villages in the city have access to at least one route providing 15 minute or better service.,39,,
315,0.97,37606.569,37611.574,"On weekdays, it has added capacity to the network for over 80,000 riders.",39,,
316,0.97,37611.574,37623.552,"During height of the Seattle squeeze we had capacity for 8,000 rides during the morning or afternoon commutes to and from downtown Seattle.",39,,
317,0.97,37623.552,37634.43,"In addition, STBD has been able to support community based programs and Trainings to increase access to transit for seniors, people with disabilities, low income people.",39,,
318,0.97,37634.43,37642.605,"We also want to highlight that in 2017, S DOT completed a racial equity Inaugural Augusta Sis of STBD.",39,,
319,0.97,37642.605,37649.678,This looked at the service investments made under the program as well as structure and policies of the program.,39,,
320,0.97,37649.678,37657.453,"Key populations evaluated were people of color, low income households, persons with disabilities, households with no car ownership.",39,,
321,0.97,37657.453,37671.0,"As a result of the analysis, council passed a scope change to allow investment in key routes in northern and Southern edges of the city as well as added investments to Orca opportunity.",39,,
322,0.97,37671.0,37690.886,We will speak to future equity work and how we will continue to work to ensure our investment decisions are equitable in the new proposal later in the presentation . I want to take a minute to talk about the Orca opportunity program.,39,,
323,0.97,37690.886,37696.859,It provides free unlimited 12 month Orca cards for high school students at Seattle public schools.,39,,
324,0.97,37696.859,37702.564,Income eligible middle school students in Seattle public schools and Seattle promise scholars.,39,,
325,0.97,37702.564,37717.079,"As you will see again as we get into the details of our current proposal, we are proposing to continue this program, Orca opportunity program, as it is currently constituted in the new proposal.",39,,
326,0.97,37717.079,37729.224,"With that, I am going to turn it over to Candida Lorenzana who will talk in more specifics about the proposal today.",39,,
327,0.97,37729.224,37729.625,Good morning.,40,,
328,0.97,37729.625,37744.273,I think we know a lot has changed in the past months and that includes statewide passage of I-976 and subsequent court proceedings that have limited our ability to put vehicle license fee in front of voters.,40,,
329,0.97,37744.273,37748.577,It's Necessitied reductions in our current program by 50%.,40,,
330,0.97,37748.577,37762.324,We are facing a global pandemic with Covid-19 that is seeing reductions in sales tax revenues that support the program and also created uncertainty about how and when transit rider ship will return.,40,,
331,0.97,37762.324,37769.665,"In West Seattle, for communities in and around West Seattle, they're facing mobility crisis with the recent bridge closure in March.",40,,
332,0.97,37769.665,37777.639,All these factors combined have influenced the proposal before you today.,40,,
333,0.97,37777.639,37784.446,Generally we have seen transit rider ship decrease.,40,,
334,0.97,37784.446,37789.685,We continue to see it used for essential trips.,40,,
335,0.97,37789.685,37808.704,"There are over 130,000 essential trips every day occurring in the system and that includes 10 Metra routes that are Seattle based and serve Seattle areas with higher percentage of communities of color.",40,,
336,0.97,37808.704,37815.511,"As Karen mentioned, transit has been essential to the growth of our city but it is also essential to recovery.",40,,
337,0.97,37815.511,37819.047,We can't recover if people can't get around.,40,,
338,0.97,37819.047,37829.658,Since 2010 we have seen the percent of commuters using transit to get downtown increase while seeing a 9% drop in the drive alone rate.,40,,
339,0.97,37829.658,37841.67,Transit is essential for recovery and is essential to creating a sustainable city that can meet our climate goals.,40,,
340,0.97,37841.67,37871.066,"This Stbt proposal Aligns with needs, challenges, values we face today by Prioritizing five key areas that include frequent transit for all in Seattle, ensuring our transit system is connected and robust and centered on equity, ensuring affordable access to mobility, addressing mobility needs we are seeing due to Covid or with the West Seattle bridge closure, and also maintaining sales tax rate that is in place today.",40,,
341,0.97,37871.066,37885.781,"At each phase of reopening, we have seen transit rider ship increase and it will continue to be an essential service as our economy recovers.",40,,
342,0.97,37885.781,37899.394,This slide provides details on elements of the proposal and average annual investment expected over the six year life of the proposal.,40,,
343,0.97,37899.394,37908.136,"To provide safe frequent transit and ensure we have a connected system, a lot of our investment is focused this two areas.",40,,
344,0.97,37908.136,37909.605,Service and capital.,40,,
345,0.97,37909.605,37915.01,Service remains majority of investment with focus on protecting the 15 minute transit network.,40,,
346,0.97,37915.01,37924.953,"On the capital side these would fund transit spot improvements, things you may already see on the street in process for 2020.",40,,
347,0.97,37924.953,37945.374,"Some examples include red bus lanes, bus zone upgrades we have implemented at Lake City way and 125th as well as the Lanor Lane and bus stop improvements we have done that improve rider experience on the C line and route 40, some of our most popular routes in the city.",40,,
348,0.97,37945.374,37958.987,In addition to the improvements this funds a portion of programs that are funded by the current $20 Vlf which if you recall is at risk with current I976 proceedings.,40,,
349,0.97,37958.987,37971.366,This would focus on ensuring that transit corridors maintain a smooth ride for riders as well as ensuring that signals operate to support transit.,40,,
350,0.97,37971.366,37979.341,To ensure affordable access to mobility we are maintaining two key programs from the current STBD measure.,40,,
351,0.97,37979.341,38004.099,"That includes Orca opportunity for youth which provides free 12 month passes for Seattle public high school students, low income, middle school system, Seattle promise scholars as well as maintaining funding for low income access to transit program which allowed us to create connections with the community and with seniors, people with disabilities, those with low incomes.",40,,
352,0.97,38004.099,38007.436,"Lastly, this proposal also addresses acute mobility needs.",40,,
353,0.97,38007.436,38022.884,"Looking to make investments in bus service, either our taxi service to support some of the needs in West Seattle.",40,,
354,0.97,38022.884,38027.022,This site illustrates how the spending is proposed to change over time.,40,,
355,0.97,38027.022,38035.597,"I would like to highlight that the 2021 revenues appear lower since sales tax collection does not begin until April 1, 2021.",40,,
356,0.97,38035.597,38045.006,"Over the six year life of the measure, a majority of the investment remains in transit, just over 40%.",40,,
357,0.97,38045.006,38062.057,A quarter each is spent on capital and mobility and remainder on emerging needs which transitions over the life of the measure to fund City- wide transit service.,40,,
358,0.97,38062.057,38067.729,Transportation remains the second highest cost for many of those in our community.,40,,
359,0.97,38067.729,38074.87,"So through this proposal, we have put forward many ways we will be addressing equity in this package.",40,,
360,0.97,38074.87,38083.879,"First and foremost as Karen mentioned, we did Rsji analysis in 2017.",40,,
361,0.97,38083.879,38087.949,We would be Revisiting that to evaluate future Nvestments.,40,,
362,0.97,38087.949,38103.198,On the capital side we would be looking to optimize investments ensuring they're equitably and that folks have a reliable ride.,40,,
363,0.97,38103.198,38108.036,As helped this fully funds work opportunity and access program.,40,,
364,0.97,38108.036,38125.821,Through emerging needs bucket this will ensure that folks impacted by the West Seattle bridge closure have mobility options as well as mitigate impacts we are seeing in communities due to the bridge closure.,40,,
365,0.97,38125.821,38129.524,We also ran for future equity work.,40,,
366,0.97,38129.524,38132.828,We would be updating our 2017 analysis.,40,,
367,0.97,38132.828,38144.706,"This would allow us to take into account rider ship trends we have seen in Covid-19 and also allow us to align investments with community needs, land use, demand as it changes across the city.",40,,
368,0.97,38144.706,38154.282,We work closely with transit advisory board and transportation equity to inform these decisions.,40,,
369,0.97,38154.282,38159.054,There are a few links here for more information on the program itself.,40,,
370,0.97,38159.054,38171.299,The proposal as well as a link to our four year report and subsequent year reports we provided before every year of the measure that you can go back and look at.,40,,
371,0.97,38171.299,38179.107,You will find Rsji analysis report in the year two report if you are interested in that as well.,40,,
372,0.97,38179.107,38179.975,Thank you for your time.,40,,
373,0.97,38179.975,38182.878,I look forward to your questions.,40,,
374,0.97,38182.878,38185.413,Thank you very much.,41,,
375,0.97,38185.413,38186.081,Appreciate that.,41,,
376,0.97,38186.081,38189.551,Anything else from the executive or Calvin chow?,41,,
377,0.97,38189.551,38196.725,Did you want to add anything before I recognize Council members to make comments or ask questions?,41,,
378,0.97,38196.725,38199.161,This is Calvin chow from central staff.,42,,
379,0.97,38199.161,38202.43,One comment I wanted to highlight.,42,,
380,0.97,38202.43,38206.034,In the presentation the executive explained the proposed spending plan.,42,,
381,0.97,38206.034,38226.521,"I wanted to clarify that the legislation itself, the proposal that goes before voters establishes spending limits within specific spending categories, doesn't explicitly approve a particular spending plan but includes maximum limits.",42,,
382,0.97,38226.521,38241.77,"So just to be clear, this is about the enabling legislation that we are asking voters to approve and then the actual spending would have to come forward as a spending proposal in the budget and Deliberated and approved by Council in the future.",42,,
383,0.97,38241.77,38244.673,Would that be on an annual basis?,43,,
384,0.97,38244.673,38244.906,Yes.,44,,
385,0.97,38244.906,38245.273,Thank you.,45,,
386,0.97,38245.273,38251.279,I would like to open it up to my Council colleagues.,45,,
387,0.97,38251.279,38259.788,Let's see if I can see you all.,45,,
388,0.97,38259.788,38260.255,One moment.,45,,
389,0.97,38260.255,38264.559,You can wave at me and I will call on you or you can do the chat.,45,,
390,0.97,38264.559,38268.997,I am happy to hear from folks.,45,,
391,0.97,38268.997,38270.899,I see Council member Herbold.,45,,
392,0.97,38270.899,38272.734,Why don't you go ahead.,45,,
393,0.97,38272.734,38273.335,Thank you.,45,,
394,0.97,38273.335,38273.702,Thank you.,46,,
395,0.97,38273.702,38279.541,"Calvin, I am sorry, I lost track of what you said there.",46,,
396,0.97,38279.541,38292.053,What elements of what we just heard would be part of an annual spending plan we would vote on that is not part of the ordinance putting it on the ballot?,46,,
397,0.97,38292.053,38296.358,The ordinance identifies four categories of eligible spending.,47,,
398,0.97,38296.358,38303.164,Transit service is identified as a specific use of funds and it is not capped in terms of the amount of money we could spend.,47,,
399,0.97,38303.164,38315.043,"Emerging needs for West Seattle bridge, Covid response, other emerging needs is identified and it establishes a cap up to 6 million annually that could be spent.",47,,
400,0.97,38315.043,38321.85,Mobility access is identified for up to 10 million annually and transit infrastructure is identified for up to 9 million annually.,47,,
401,0.97,38321.85,38324.953,Those are limits that would be in the ballot.,47,,
402,0.97,38324.953,38334.763,So within that the Council and Mayor--Mayor can propose and Council can approve expenditures year to year within the limits.,47,,
403,0.97,38334.763,38336.898,Thank you.,48,,
404,0.97,38336.898,38340.201,I have a couple questions.,48,,
405,0.97,38340.201,38350.178,Slide 12 shows West Seattle emergency need investments going through 2024.,48,,
406,0.97,38350.178,38359.287,I just expressed my very sincere appreciation for the recognition of the needs in West Seattle.,48,,
407,0.97,38359.287,38368.697,We are going from 21 lanes--we have gone from 21 lanes to 12 lanes to get off of the Peninsula.,48,,
408,0.97,38368.697,38378.173,And there are no amount of Detour routes that can make possible moving the same number of cars.,48,,
409,0.97,38378.173,38385.914,"So the city, S DOT has some very aggressive mode shift goals from 17% now to 30%.",48,,
410,0.97,38385.914,38396.358,We are not going to be able to achieve the goals without specific investments in bus service in West Seattle.,48,,
411,0.97,38396.358,38403.131,"My specific question about that though, it shows that the investments taper off in 2014.",48,,
412,0.97,38403.131,38417.879,I am just wondering could this change depending on the path that s DOT chooses for repair or replace under the repair scenario?,48,,
413,0.97,38417.879,38429.19,"I can see the need tapering off in 2014 but in the replace scenario, it could go beyond that.",48,,
414,0.97,38429.19,38439.0,I know we are hoping under the repair scenario that the bridge will be reopened by 2022.,48,,
415,0.97,38439.0,38446.241,We are giving ourselves additional time for the replace scenario.,48,,
416,0.97,38446.241,38456.618,I am just concerned that there are other considerations associated with a really large project like the replacement of a large bridge.,48,,
417,0.97,38456.618,38458.653,That's one question.,48,,
418,0.97,38458.653,38469.464,Then the other question I have is about the issue around the capital improvements.,48,,
419,0.97,38469.464,38493.254,"I know that last year we had talked about the fact that for our frequent transit routes, we had pretty much reached the capacity for added service because of situations, challenges regarding constraints of King County Metra's base.",48,,
420,0.97,38493.254,38512.207,This proposal is smaller than the previous one and I am wondering whether or not Metra has the capacity to add the transit service with a potentially reduced funding for capital improvements.,48,,
421,0.97,38512.207,38512.64,One other question.,48,,
422,0.97,38512.64,38519.147,"On emerging needs for West Seattle, is water taxi service eligible?",48,,
423,0.97,38519.147,38519.447,Thank you.,48,,
424,0.97,38519.447,38526.754,"Council member, why don't I take a first shot and Candida and Karen feel free to Chime in.",49,,
425,0.97,38526.754,38537.165,"I think on the West Seattle questions, yes, it is a water taxi service that is eligible under the proposal.",49,,
426,0.97,38537.165,38555.95,"Second, I think you raise a good point, that depending on the Pathway that s DOT ends Uptaking, the city ends Uptaking to the repair replace or just straight replace that we will need to adapt accordingly.",49,,
427,0.97,38555.95,38559.387,We sort of put in the general bucket of transit service.,49,,
428,0.97,38559.387,38568.062,I think again I go back to this is why we created some flexibility in the proposal to be able to adapt to the emerging needs.,49,,
429,0.97,38568.062,38588.65,Correct me if I am wrong Karen or Candida but I don't think there is anything in the proposal that would preclude our ability to continue to invest in transit service to support future needs if they become emergent.,49,,
430,0.97,38588.65,38589.05,You're right.,50,,
431,0.97,38589.05,38600.461,We have allowed ourselves some flexibility to address different emerging needs including West Seattle bridge impacts.,50,,
432,0.97,38600.461,38601.496,Thank you.,51,,
433,0.97,38601.496,38607.535,On your second question related to what capacity does Metro have to deliver a service?,52,,
434,0.97,38607.535,38610.572,We have had past challenges with that.,52,,
435,0.97,38610.572,38623.518,"Obviously this is a much more modest investment and we feel confident that Metro within what their future service plans are, they're able to deliver this.",52,,
436,0.97,38623.518,38640.435,"Again the transit capital program has always meant and has been intended to be a complement to that to be sure that we are able to have frequent reliable service to the other investments and also investments in rider experience, investments in bus lanes, those types of things.",52,,
437,0.97,38640.435,38646.107,I think there is some question about pot holes.,52,,
438,0.97,38646.107,38654.983,The truth is that we have a maintenance program that continues to need investment in it.,52,,
439,0.97,38654.983,38658.519,The buses on our streets cause significant wear and tear.,52,,
440,0.97,38658.519,38679.974,"While we are in the process of rebuilding many transit corridors full scale, Delridge is a great example, there will continue to be a need to invest in Capitol to make sure we are able to continue to run the type of transit service that we are running in those corridors.",52,,
441,0.97,38679.974,38694.889,"While the maintenance program for streets may seem sort of adjacent in some ways to the transit program, it is very much necessary and was being funded out of that $20 Vlf that we now have lost.",52,,
442,0.97,38694.889,38728.99,"I think that it's fair to say if our ability to use car tabs is restored through the court challenge, that will create additional flexibility around the dollars and being both sort of the Blf that exists that we are collecting in reserve but also sort of future opportunities to expand the Blf to support these needs.",52,,
443,0.97,38728.99,38731.125,Thank you Council member Herbold.,53,,
444,0.97,38731.125,38735.73,I will ask other members if they have questions.,53,,
445,0.97,38735.73,38737.632,Vice chair Strauss.,54,,
446,0.97,38737.632,38739.467,"Thank you, chair Pedersen.",55,,
447,0.97,38739.467,38745.006,I will be brief with my remarks just to note my full support of this measure.,55,,
448,0.97,38745.006,38756.084,"In our ideal world we want to see the ability to go to a bus stop, not be able to check the schedule, get on the bus and get where people are going without being stuck in traffic.",55,,
449,0.97,38756.084,38761.389,We know transit only lanes and frequent bus service is the way we can accomplish that.,55,,
450,0.97,38761.389,38775.369,Bus service is also a climate change solution because we know during Noncovid times an immense amount of carbon emissions come from single occupancy vehicles.,55,,
451,0.97,38775.369,38783.711,The only real way for people to be able to get out of their car is if they're able to rely on transit service.,55,,
452,0.97,38783.711,38793.654,The transportation benefit district has provided immense opportunity for the city to be able to bring transit service to the areas we want since we have to work in partnership with King County Metro.,55,,
453,0.97,38793.654,38800.027,We do know that rider ship has decreased at the moment in part due to the public health concerns.,55,,
454,0.97,38800.027,38807.935,"We know that as we emerge out of this crisis people will go back to relying on transit, myself included.",55,,
455,0.97,38807.935,38813.04,I avoid using transit at this time because it is for essential trips only.,55,,
456,0.97,38813.04,38823.851,And I don't need to necessarily bring additional contact to people who have to rely on transit or the operators of our transit.,55,,
457,0.97,38823.851,38834.228,I want to take a moment to thank our operators for being able to get us around the city and the region safely.,55,,
458,0.97,38834.228,38841.836,"It's a big public health concern at this moment, and I really appreciate our operators.",55,,
459,0.97,38841.836,38853.08,"As folks stated in public comment, Joe in particular, transit is the way that we move goods and people around our city.",55,,
460,0.97,38853.08,38857.718,When you look at people being--transit is simply the freight of people.,55,,
461,0.97,38857.718,38870.231,"When we are able to move people around our community effectively without getting stuck in traffic, we are able to increase dependence and their ability to depend on transit.",55,,
462,0.97,38870.231,38887.215,"So with that, I don't really have questions other than I think it may be worth considering and I can follow up with folks Offline as to what the duration of this package should be and if we need to make changes within the percentages.",55,,
463,0.97,38887.215,38904.065,"Looking at your memo between mobility access transit infrastructure and emerging needs, I just want to complement Elliot, the deputy Mayor, everyone at s DOT, great work so far.",55,,
464,0.97,38904.065,38905.366,"Thank you, chair.",55,,
465,0.97,38905.366,38912.106,"Thank you, vice chair.",56,,
466,0.97,38912.106,38912.607,Other Council members.,56,,
467,0.97,38912.607,38915.543,Council member Morales.,56,,
468,0.97,38915.543,38920.414,Thank you.,57,,
469,0.97,38920.414,38921.215,Thanks for this presentation.,57,,
470,0.97,38921.215,38923.384,I appreciate the opportunity to ask some questions.,57,,
471,0.97,38923.384,38947.074,"I wonder if we can go back to slide 8, if we can hear a little bit more about not just the ten roots though I would like more information about the rider ship there but what other routes would be Prioritized and how the decisions will be made.",57,,
472,0.97,38947.074,38951.579,I think what I hear you saying is there are specific routes that will just be cut.,57,,
473,0.97,38951.579,38963.958,I would like to understand a little bit more what we are talking about here.,57,,
474,0.97,38963.958,38972.934,This map is intended to be an example of the types of rider ship trends that we are seeing at the moment.,58,,
475,0.97,38972.934,38976.437,That will definitely influence Rsj analysis we are planning on doing following this.,58,,
476,0.97,38976.437,38983.01,That would be more part of directing as well as engagement with transit advisement group.,58,,
477,0.97,38983.01,38987.648,Those would be elements really directing our investments at this point.,58,,
478,0.97,38987.648,39000.728,One of the challenges here I think as Council members are aware is King County Metro is facing their own financial challenges at the moment and we don't have a clear picture of what their baseline network would look like.,58,,
479,0.97,39000.728,39021.215,That is something we would want to work on with them should this proposal move forward and figure out what makes sense from an equity perspective and the network out there.,58,,
480,0.97,39021.215,39031.926,"A follow up, if you can give a little bit on information so this becomes clear for us and the community?",59,,
481,0.97,39031.926,39042.67,I think we would be looking to begin analysis either later this year once we have a better sense of what Metro's baseline could look like.,60,,
482,0.97,39042.67,39054.048,I am also happy to share some information that is behind this map to give you a better sense of the trends we are seeing on the specific routes as well.,60,,
483,0.97,39054.048,39058.986,"Perhaps Council member, I can share a little bit context in that.",61,,
484,0.97,39058.986,39067.895,We have a provision in our current operating agreement with Metro that any service that the city purchases is additive.,61,,
485,0.97,39067.895,39072.366,It's on top of what they should be providing as a baseline.,61,,
486,0.97,39072.366,39082.51,"I think the challenge has been because of Covid and their own financial uncertainty, the baseline is not clear anymore.",61,,
487,0.97,39082.51,39095.222,So what Candida is Referencing is they will need to go to their own service mapping process as it were where they do have Rsji baked in as one of their service guideline requirements.,61,,
488,0.97,39095.222,39125.719,"So once we have awareness of what they will provide, then we are able to make decisions as a city around how do we layer on top of that in terms of where we know they'll really need investments and kind of how do we include an equity lens to make sure folks who are transit dependent continue to have that frequent reliable service through that partnership.",61,,
489,0.97,39125.719,39135.229,"Thank you, council member Morales.",62,,
490,0.97,39135.229,39137.731,Council member Sawant.,62,,
491,0.97,39137.731,39140.134,Thank you.,63,,
492,0.97,39140.134,39157.785,"I appreciate the presentation, but I also have lots of issues with the way things have been brought forward and also just that there is a lot from the Mayor's office about what is actually happening.",63,,
493,0.97,39157.785,39160.287,I would appreciate if you all were more clear.,63,,
494,0.97,39160.287,39167.061,"I mean, I don't think that the presentation you have makes it clear to the public what is actually happening here.",63,,
495,0.97,39167.061,39178.873,You are all using a lot of happy phrases like strategic and centering equity and optimizing investments to be equitable.,63,,
496,0.97,39178.873,39184.178,There is nothing equitable about the politics.,63,,
497,0.97,39184.178,39185.713,Let's look at the numbers here.,63,,
498,0.97,39185.713,39190.084,I don't think this is coming from your presentation.,63,,
499,0.97,39190.084,39197.224,What I am about to say is something my staff has gleaned from central staff memo which I appreciate.,63,,
500,0.97,39197.224,39208.435,But the presentation that you have is actually a proposal for major cuts to Metro from the city's side.,63,,
501,0.97,39208.435,39212.406,"Yes, it's an overall and the city has a big stake in it.",63,,
502,0.97,39212.406,39216.677,This whole idea that it is additive but we don't know how much.,63,,
503,0.97,39216.677,39224.251,"Well let's look at how much of a cut the city is proposing, the Mayor is proposing.",63,,
504,0.97,39224.251,39229.456,Unfortunately not one slide in this presentation compares the old budget to the new one.,63,,
505,0.97,39229.456,39234.395,Instead of presentation talks about all the good things that have been funded in the past.,63,,
506,0.97,39234.395,39239.366,"Yes, that's great but that's not really telling us what is about to happen.",63,,
507,0.97,39239.366,39245.005,"Very briefly, the presentation talks about the amount of money that will be raised in the coming year.",63,,
508,0.97,39245.005,39257.718,"Let's make it clear, this proposal is about cutting the Metro bus trip hours, city's contribution to the Metro bus trip hours from 300,000 to 80,000.",63,,
509,0.97,39257.718,39281.875,That is a massive cut that we are talking about not only for the working class people and marginalized communities who rely on Metro and especially central workers who are disproportionately represented in the marginalized community and also the workers a the Metro themselves representing by local 587.,63,,
510,0.97,39281.875,39286.113,Just a quote from the central staff memo.,63,,
511,0.97,39286.113,39311.338,"In 2019 prior to economic down turn, STBD measure generated $62 million and provided 300,000 transit service hours, passes for students, and bus passes for Seattle housing authority residents.",63,,
512,0.97,39311.338,39320.814,"What's under consideration, it is 80,000 annual service hours when combining transit service and emerging needs category.",63,,
513,0.97,39320.814,39331.258,"Stbd purchased approximately 300,000 service hours in 2019 and will reduce service levels to 150,000 annualized hours beginning in September 2020 Metro service change.",63,,
514,0.97,39331.258,39349.877,Really we are talking about a massive cut and the first disservice being done to the public is it is not even being represented honestly let alone the fact that we haven't had a conversation about how can we prevent the cuts from happening in the first place?,63,,
515,0.97,39349.877,39356.35,Straight away the conversation has gone to how can we make the cuts more equitable?,63,,
516,0.97,39356.35,39356.75,Let's be clear.,63,,
517,0.97,39356.75,39359.086,There is nothing equitable about cuts.,63,,
518,0.97,39359.086,39367.828,What you are talking about is the politics where you will put one community against another and say we will save these routes but these other routes will be cut.,63,,
519,0.97,39367.828,39374.802,That's not equitable at all.,63,,
520,0.97,39374.802,39382.109,"That's the definition of injustice . Furthermore, we need to have a conversation about how the shortfalls can be back filled.",63,,
521,0.97,39382.109,39387.715,I don't accept that sales tax which is most Regressive tax should be used.,63,,
522,0.97,39387.715,39392.553,Because of our movement we won a historic victory of the Amazon tax.,63,,
523,0.97,39392.553,39395.589,We know this can be done.,63,,
524,0.97,39395.589,39402.429,Why should we accept sales tax with other options and also the possibility of a developer.,63,,
525,0.97,39402.429,39407.735,"According to state law, STBD can be funded through any of the following mechanisms.",63,,
526,0.97,39407.735,39414.441,"Sales tax, property tax, developer impact fees, regional property tax, vehicle license fee which is car tax.",63,,
527,0.97,39414.441,39417.678,There are options legally that are Progressive.,63,,
528,0.97,39417.678,39427.054,It's a question of whether the Council and Mayor's office will put any emphasis on the progressive options possible.,63,,
529,0.97,39427.054,39437.03,"One question for central staff, not that I would expect them to answer now, is administratively, could the developer in fact please be done in time?",63,,
530,0.97,39437.03,39449.276,"Then a last point I will make, the Mayor's office has frequently made arguments to suggest less transit will be required because under Covid people are not taking public Trans sit.",63,,
531,0.97,39449.276,39450.444,That is absolutely true.,63,,
532,0.97,39450.444,39454.648,I agree with those who have said we should minimize the spread of Covid.,63,,
533,0.97,39454.648,39460.12,If you don't need to use public transit we shouldn't.,63,,
534,0.97,39460.12,39462.423,So that those who need to are safer.,63,,
535,0.97,39462.423,39462.689,I agree.,63,,
536,0.97,39462.689,39468.729,But to make that in relation to STBD doesn't make sense because this is a six year proposal.,63,,
537,0.97,39468.729,39471.832,We are not just talking about what happens under Covid.,63,,
538,0.97,39471.832,39476.17,These are decisions that will have an impact later when the pandemic is resolved as well.,63,,
539,0.97,39476.17,39483.577,That needs to be kept in mind as well.,63,,
540,0.97,39483.577,39485.779,Thank you.,63,,
541,0.97,39485.779,39490.884,"Thank you, council member.",64,,
542,0.97,39490.884,39494.922,"Calvin, council member Sawant brought up your central staff memo which is helpful.",64,,
543,0.97,39494.922,39499.393,For the viewing public it is Online with today's agenda.,64,,
544,0.97,39499.393,39503.03,It does talk about other revenue options.,64,,
545,0.97,39503.03,39509.703,Are you able to address Council member Sawant's question now or is this something you want to get back to us on or both?,64,,
546,0.97,39509.703,39519.213,"Really briefly, those are the revenue options state law allows for transportation benefit districts to pursue.",65,,
547,0.97,39519.213,39524.318,"As noted, vehicle license fee is not legal under initiative 976.",65,,
548,0.97,39524.318,39531.992,"Unless we are successful in overturning that initiative, we won't have access to those revenue sources.",65,,
549,0.97,39531.992,39539.166,"The development impact fee, it may be more, may need to do more research to get back to the council member.",65,,
550,0.97,39539.166,39543.103,I think it would take time to development.,65,,
551,0.97,39543.103,39549.142,Of course follow the economic cycle a little bit so they're less stable than some of the other funding sources.,65,,
552,0.97,39549.142,39556.283,It may be difficult to fund things like regular transit service hours based on that.,65,,
553,0.97,39556.283,39560.287,It is something that is eligible revenue for the benefit district.,65,,
554,0.97,39560.287,39569.062,As well I would point out that the city of Seattle has other potential revenue sources they can bring to bear if they choose.,65,,
555,0.97,39569.062,39574.201,"Council member Sawant, I share your interest in real estate developer impact fees as well.",66,,
556,0.97,39574.201,39582.376,I look forward to Calvin getting back to us with more information on that.,66,,
557,0.97,39582.376,39582.876,Council member Herbold.,66,,
558,0.97,39582.876,39592.92,I have a little bit information about the transportation developer impact fees because it is something I was working on with Council member O'Brien last year.,67,,
559,0.97,39592.92,39598.358,Well I guess it was more than last year.,67,,
560,0.97,39598.358,39612.606,"But Anyways, where it was left is first of all people should understand it's my understanding that the developer impact fees, the limitation is that it can only be used for capital expenses.",67,,
561,0.97,39612.606,39630.19,But we do know that capital expenses associated with additional need for transit is ineligible expense.,67,,
562,0.97,39630.19,39646.64,The central staff free man had been working to do a Council driven developer transportation impact fee proposal because of the keen interest from some members of Council putting this forward.,67,,
563,0.97,39646.64,39655.816,And we had made an amendment to the plan to create a project list.,67,,
564,0.97,39655.816,39659.786,That project list was appealed to the hearing Examiner.,67,,
565,0.97,39659.786,39673.266,The hearing Examiner remanded the threshold decision of Nonsignificance back to central staff to complete a part of the check list that is generally applicable to project specific review.,67,,
566,0.97,39673.266,39681.441,So I understood that central staff was going to be doing that around November of last year.,67,,
567,0.97,39681.441,39691.084,"But then since the hearing Examiner also retained jurisdiction, it would allow to provide additional rebuttal information and commentary.",67,,
568,0.97,39691.084,39696.423,I don't know what happened after that point.,67,,
569,0.97,39696.423,39710.737,But the long and short of it is these changes to the COMP plan were basically setting us up for another set of necessary changes to the COMP plan for this March.,67,,
570,0.97,39710.737,39719.713,The Council did not take up the 2020 COMP plan update this March.,67,,
571,0.97,39719.713,39734.361,"So I think as Calvin mentioned, there is some question about how quickly we could move forward at transportation development impact program which making these necessary changes to the COMP plan.",67,,
572,0.97,39734.361,39741.268,But I too am very interested in having more information about that.,67,,
573,0.97,39741.268,39748.475,"Council members if I may, the city actually has two Venues, two avenues of authority for developer fees.",68,,
574,0.97,39748.475,39758.018,One is the growth management act authority that the council member Herbold was talking about.,68,,
575,0.97,39758.018,39770.297,"There is separate state legislation, transportation benefit legislation allows that may have difference in technicalities.",68,,
576,0.97,39770.297,39781.808,We have seen other jurisdictions use growth management act before.,68,,
577,0.97,39781.808,39782.776,Let's look into that.,69,,
578,0.97,39782.776,39796.99,"While developing I think we looked at other options available and recognizing things like developer impact fees, lids, and all that stuff wouldn't fit on the time line that matched with when this was expiring at the end of the year.",70,,
579,0.97,39796.99,39801.328,"We saw that as a one year, two year process.",70,,
580,0.97,39801.328,39806.9,We are committed to finding additional sources of revenue for Tran sit in Seattle.,70,,
581,0.97,39806.9,39816.877,This is against a deadline of this when developing this proposal.,70,,
582,0.97,39816.877,39817.41,Thank you.,70,,
583,0.97,39817.41,39819.079,Thank you.,71,,
584,0.97,39819.079,39826.486,"Council members Juarez and Lewis, I can't see you so you can just Chime in if you have questions.",71,,
585,0.97,39826.486,39827.721,Thank you.,72,,
586,0.97,39827.721,39829.556,This is Council member Juarez.,72,,
587,0.97,39829.556,39834.027,"Council member Lewis, were you ahead of me?",72,,
588,0.97,39834.027,39835.662,You can go.,73,,
589,0.97,39835.662,39836.263,That's perfectly fine.,73,,
590,0.97,39836.263,39838.999,"Calvin, I am looking at your memo.",74,,
591,0.97,39838.999,39849.643,Thank you yesterday for walking me through issues and also to the s DOT staff that worked with my staff and I yesterday and went through the Powerpoint.,74,,
592,0.97,39849.643,39868.295,"On page 2 of your memo, I think it is five pages, I may be over SIMPLIFYING this question, this goes to what Council member Sawant was talking about, politics of in the sales tax.",74,,
593,0.97,39868.295,39890.45,"The STBD measure, if it is not renewed and there is no additional transit funding and we don't see anything at least right now coming from the state or the Feds and we don't know what's going to happen with the challenge of 976 which is in the Washington state Supreme Court, what's the worst case scenario?",74,,
594,0.97,39890.45,39901.628,"When you say there is money in reserves to last through March 2021, what's worst case scenario we are talking here?",74,,
595,0.97,39901.628,39919.412,It means that we wouldn't have Rev in you to purchase transit service or pay for bus passes or any of the programmatic investments past the end of this year and transit service past March of 2021.,75,,
596,0.97,39919.412,39928.121,"So the five, spending levels of the categories, those five, all of that goes away, correct?",76,,
597,0.97,39928.121,39928.421,Correct.,77,,
598,0.97,39928.421,39936.429,"We have money now until March to attend to these needs and then after that, it will all go away.",78,,
599,0.97,39936.429,39941.067,"The March money, some of it is more about our contractual obligations with Metro.",79,,
600,0.97,39941.067,39946.373,We can only make service changes on their schedule in the fall and spring.,79,,
601,0.97,39946.373,39953.98,S DOT has preserved some money to be sure we can meet our contractual obligations to get to the service change in March.,79,,
602,0.97,39953.98,39959.419,I know we talked a little bit about this.,80,,
603,0.97,39959.419,39964.624,"I apologize for not remembering everybody's name, S DOT folks.",80,,
604,0.97,39964.624,39982.475,"We talked at length certainly with my participation on sound transit and with the Puget sound regional Council transportation board, impacts to what we were looking at as Council member Herbold raised to the bridge and how much was allocated to redesign and rebuild.",80,,
605,0.97,39982.475,40000.593,Bridge and now we know we need additional services is it fair to say that West Seattle will take a major hit in transportation in just getting downtown?,80,,
606,0.97,40000.593,40007.434,"Council member, are you referring to if we wouldn't pass the measure?",81,,
607,0.97,40007.434,40007.701,Yes.,82,,
608,0.97,40007.701,40008.001,Yes.,83,,
609,0.97,40008.001,40013.34,"In addition to what Calvin is saying, we wouldn't be able to purchase service past March.",83,,
610,0.97,40013.34,40025.051,Not only West Seattle but the entire city would see impacts of reduced service from the city's investment and from Metro's own budget challenge.,83,,
611,0.97,40025.051,40030.79,The impacts would be felt acutely in the West Seattle Peninsula because of the West Seattle bridge closure too.,83,,
612,0.97,40030.79,40033.76,That's what I was getting at.,84,,
613,0.97,40033.76,40042.769,That seems to be most emergent issue now in regards to the three transportation committees where they all dove tail and everyone is kind of sitting back.,84,,
614,0.97,40042.769,40049.209,I think we discussed this yesterday as well.,84,,
615,0.97,40049.209,40057.15,We should thank the Congress woman for her wonderful speech on the floor advocating for Federal money for West Seattle bridge.,84,,
616,0.97,40057.15,40084.711,"Again getting back to the tax and renewal of it, my concern is because a lot of us are getting light rail and we have a ten minute to different bus areas, I have a concern, obviously Council member Herbold's as well, the impact to those that need to get downtown and rely on this.",84,,
617,0.97,40084.711,40088.948,"And also the public school, we provide Orca cards.",84,,
618,0.97,40088.948,40090.45,That's my concern.,84,,
619,0.97,40090.45,40090.75,Thank you.,84,,
620,0.97,40090.75,40092.852,"Thank you, council member.",85,,

628,0.97,40147.273,40163.756,I am glad for the discretion to not expand more of our Council Mattic sales tax authority just given the economic nature of what folks are going through and the Regressive nature of a sales tax.,86,,
629,0.97,40163.756,40170.63,I am glad we are simply pursuing renewal and not expansion of the Council Mattic sales tax authority.,86,,
630,0.97,40170.63,40204.797,"I would signal here that I do eagerly await the ability for us to change up the formula again in a supplemental way once we do get more guidance on the fate of our ability to meaningfully include car tabs again as part of how we can guarantee and provide this essential service, look forward to continuing to follow your leadership here on this Committee and look forward to supporting this proposal.",86,,
