I will lead the discussion before we request signatures . a little background history, the concept of an indigenous people's day is not a new one . It was first proposed in the 1970s by a Deln a delegation of Naltive peoples to the U.N. in a conference against discrimination . yours truly had an opportunity to study human rights and international law and native American folks in Geneva Switzerland when I was in law school . In 2017, the Seattle Council passed resolution 31538 creating indigenous people's day in our city, sponsored by Councilmember Sawant . and Councilmember then Bruce Harrell who is now our Mayor . T Mayor . Last March, by passing an ordinance, we made every second Monday in October indigenous PS indigenous people's day, an official city holiday . cities and States throughout the country now recognize this Dayt Biden was the first United States President to recognize it on the Federal level through an executive proclamation in 2021. the President said today we acknowledge the painful history of wrongs and atrocities that many European explorers inflicted on tribal nations and indigenous communities . It is a measure of our greatness that we do not seek to bury the shameful episodes of the past, that we face them honestly and bring them to light and do all we can to address them . The proclamation we have before you is our annual recognition of is of indigenous people's day that will be presented as part of the ceremonies which will take place Monday, October 10th . The 10th . There are three planned events on Monday which everyone is welcomed to join . The first one is the March from 9:30 to 11:30, meeting at West Lake park .

Councir Seattle . Councilmember Sawant?",43,,
48,0.97,538.371,691.157,"Thank you Councilmember Juarez, I really Apprecite your noting the history of indigenous people's day and the tremendous work that has been done by indigenous activists and by the indigenous community in recognizing the Traumas of Colonization and Imperalism and the role that is being played by committee members to this day . It was a real matter of honor for my Socialist Council office and Socialist alternatives to have worked along side indigenous members in 2014 to bring forth the indigenous people's Resolutione resolution . Since then, we have gone forward to also pass a resolution recognizing the incredibly harmful experiences that indigenous children were subjected to through the boarding school practice which we know how horrendous they are and the Traumas are still being lived by those generations and the future generations . that is why it is so important that thy the community across Seattle and Vancouver in the Pacific Northwest has been marking the somber moment . and we also worked together on the no Dapple resolution, marking our solidarity with the courageous, tens of thousands of courageous community members and environmental activists who braved police violence at standing rock for their opposition against the pipe line . So you know, there is Boh history and also current activism we want to Celebrate.D celebrate . and also recognize the Harms done and connect this to affordable housing and dignified rights for so many of our indigenous communities and other races who are facing poverty, inequality, a lack of funding in public schools, and also student debt . I think indigenous people's day is sort of a reminder for us that our society has a long way to go to deliver for the people around us.",44,,

73,0.97,819.852,1113.779,"Well, hello, everyone . Startg everyone . starting with meetings last week, I met with SPD North precinct captain Grossman and attended the third watch roll calls . Captain Grossman said that the city attorney's high Utilizer list has been a game Changer for the North precinct in reducing the rate of increased crime in the precinct . so that is good Newsd news . and something that other officers said during roll call was that other people Committig crimes, they note that it is for misdemeanor, Ui and sexual assault cases and that was also mentioned in the Seattle Timesy times . My chief of staff attended the quarterly Seattle board meeting last Wednesday of visit Seattle . Just want to report that the expanded convention center is opening in December . While they will be down in revenue the next few years compared to Prepandemic, they are confident they will see a strong return in Revenuem revenue from the larger conventions that will be available to accommodate in the years to come . They ask that we convey again, thank you to my colleagues for support of the N the legislation which increased their resources to be used to promote Seattle as a tourist destination . If you are interested at all in how they spent the additional revenue, I'm happy to provide a report on that . My chief of staff and I attended the Mar key gala, the first one in three years, last Thursday at Seattle center . It was a pretty good time . We got to meet the new executive director, Tom Lorra in person finally . I had to say thank you to do all they can to sustain during the previous years . If anyone has a chance to attend, they have some pretty good dancing at the end of these events in the Future.E future . NOTE to self on that one . My policy director met with representatives of businesses along Madison street that have been impacted by Street and sidewalk closures related to the bus rapid transit line construction . You have probably been hearing from the businesses as well . I continue to grope for solutions to help small businesses that are Shouldering the burden of really important road projects and not just road products but public infrastructure projects in general . So hopefully we can come to ideas on that one . last Friday, our staff met with senior leadership of Sciu to talk about the upcoming budget and impact on social Services.O just a note on something I will be doing tomorrow, joining the Mayor and Oeb director Mcentire on an event that will announce a new program that provide meaningful support to small businesses . I can't say more than that but stay tuned for tt exciting news . Finally on Wednesday, I get to attend the first in person Puget sound meeting . and I'm heads down in budget as I'm sure everyone else is . before I cede the Mic, Ú I want to say thank you to Councilmember Pedersen for the statement he put out in response to the three separate incidents of shootings in the t U district over the weekend because I think it captures well the gravity of the problems we are facing when it comes to gun violence and not just in the U district but across our city . The question that I bring to my budget decisions and in these deliberations is how can we best most effectively spend public resources to keep people safe in the city of Seattle . tt is also something that is on the mind of Uw President Anna Mary Casa who said in her own statement, quote, no one should have to fear for their safety as they go about their daily lives . So now I pass it to Councilmember Pedersen if there are not any questions . seeing none, take it away.",67,,
74,0.97,1113.779,1407.506,"Good afternoon, colleagues . K colleagues . Thank you Councilmember Nelson . On tomorrow afternoon's full city council agenda, we have three items from the transportation committee and public Utilitiese utilities . We recommended 120410 which is a modest update to the plan solid waste rates . When solid waste rates are combined with the other lines of business, we expect to see overall rates for customers increase at a lower percentage than what was recently promised . that is good news overall for public utility rates . I appreciate Sbu doing everything they can to keep rate increases to a minimum and keeping their promises on the rate Pat that was approved by the Council . If you have questions about that, police ask Brian goodnight or consult his memo which is attached to the agenda item . tomorrow we are voting on two related pieces of legislation from public utilities . They will enable the city to stream line how we Memorialize the pass through rates we are required to use from King County, relating to drainage and waste water services . Unlike our charges for solid waste and drinking water, we have no control over the drainage rates which are passed through to each customer to fill . Both pieces of legislation create certainty and remove the redundancy . It makes clear to the constituents that need to contact King County Officials.S officials . This legislation will make the process similar to the Seattle city light process where fees from the Bountival are passed through because we can't change those fees Eithere either . While the committee approved 1304 for drainage, a drafting change on the other waste water required us to hear that in our committee as an informational draft . tomorrow both bills arrive at the full council at the same time for our consideration . If you have any questions about those, also contact central staff or Brian goodnight or consult his Memoes . My office enjoyed the event organized by the nonprofit transportation coalition which honored several transportation champions . This past Friday I met with constituents on in person after hours in the heart of district 4. constituents brought Concers brought concerns about abandoned properties that are Magnets Fol for criminal activity and fire hazards as well . You can sign up for the office hours through my city council Website . I joined students and neighbors attending the U district food walk and street party which activated the Avenue in Distrit in district 4 this weekend Snvet weekend Snvenlt I will turn to the more tragic events that Councilmember Nelson alluded to . I visited the sites of each of the shootings that recently shook the University district neighborhood three days in a row of violence . I met with the Mayor in district 4 this morning . I confirmed with the Seattle police chief, University of Washington, and the nonprofit that over sees the improvement area . We are unified in our commitment to the safety of all committees in Seattle including universities, strict Seattle police chief will be meeting this week . I look forward to action plans, to the parents, deeply concerned about their children attending college in the neighborhood who reached out to my office . please know as a fellow parent, my commitment to share safety is personal . that is the same neighborhood in which my wife and I are raising our children . The University district is at a pivotal moment with the opening of the light rail station, return of tens of thousands of students to the world class campus and new construction projects increasing vitality . We can solidify a Renaissance for the entire committee . I want to thank the Council for responding as quickly as they did . for the victims, I want to encourage the trained detectives to bring to justice those responsible for the gun violence . Everyone deserves to feel safe here in Seattle . Safy in Seattle . safety must be a priority in the city and I support our Mayor's budget proposal to provide ample resources for programs . I look forward to working with my colleagues for results . that concludes my report . any questions before we move to Councilmember Saswant? thank you.",68,,
75,0.97,1407.506,1625.123,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen . good afternoon, everyone . There are no items on tomorrow's Agend a from the interest rates committee . like other committees, there are no meetings scheduled until after the end of budget deliberations . before I go on to the next point, I wanted to apologize to Councilmembers and members of the public for not being able to be on camera pause of technology reasons . I would like to express solidarity with the Iranian community in Seattle and the mass movement of women and young people in Iran who are fighting for justice for Masha Amina and to over throw the far right regime . O over the weekend, Socialist alternative and community organizers from my office joined hundreds of protesters organizing International solidarity with the struggle in Iran . Masha Amina was beaten by the morality police, the agents of the Iranian regime and died after being in a Coma for three days . women in Iran are arrested and beaten on a daily basis for the way they Dressedt dressed . It is deep seeded Misogyny . This is why the first part of many was this could have been me or my daughter or sister or friend . This is not the first time women have been killed in detention or under torture . throughout the history, the regime has billed these murders as heart attacks and suicides . This time, however, it has led to widespread protests in various forms from sit INS to strike action from demonstrators, demonstrations at the universities to actions in front of the police officers . Y officers . They are seeking now to break the movement and the ongoing strike action . in the Kurdish regions, they are resorted to killings of the demonstrations . But anger came out at this point . Zeena's live was taken in which the regime is in multiple crisis . poverty and sky rocketing prices affect women even harder . They are in a deep crisis risking their rule in every step with growing protest waves and strike actions from teachers, oil workers, nurses, to bus drivers . The people have had enough . The women and youth are at the forefront of struggle to end the rule of the far right killers . of course, it should be said that the successes of these movements will depend entirely on the political course they take and the leadership of the movements . Te movements . The struggle against dress codes in Iran is with the struggle of the entire regime and capital system in Iran and internationally . It is the same as the courageous struggle of Muslim women in India who are fighting on campus to wear Hijab if they wish but they are being attacked . It is about the freedom to choose how you dress which is Antthetical to the right wing religious regimes which use personal oppression to retain grip on power . The rulers need to control women's bodies and lives even more . The Iranian regime needs the oppression of women through religious laws to maintain gender roles and the mass exploitation of women in the H.",69,,
76,0.97,1625.123,1677.876,"While Western politicians suggest the Biden Administration are trying to Instrumentalize the death for their own agenda, it is clear that these forces cannot be trusted . where is their outrage at the absolutely brutal religious Deitatorship in Saudi Arabia who treatment of women is equally Abomenable? this is why it is only through the power of regular women, workers, all oppressed and poor in Iran, organized independently from the false Imperalism and big business that the far right regimes can be overthrown . This is why it is important that working Peope working people and young people in the West have protest actions in solidarity with the movement in Iran . Unless Councilmembers have any questions on my report, I will hand it over to Councilmember Strauss.",69,,

I know of Iranian women who are worried about their families back home . Becae home . because the Nerd that I am, if those of you haven't watched, there is a four part special series on HBO, happening right now that you should watch going back from 1953 to 1979 to 2022. so those of us who have been around long enough to remember the 1979 and president Carter and the hostage situation and there Ise to it than that . The historical, political, social, what led up to 2022, I think what I walk away with still is that the people who get hurt the most are women, children . The reforms always come at the cost of females and women and women's lives . So this isn't that removed from this country and what we see . I could go on and on but I won't . I want to thank you for bringing that Upe up . those types of international issues are not just about being in another country or different border . The effect of the politics, the global political politics and how we view ourselves as women of the world and not just our own country . O country . So I want to thank you for that celebrity Sawant.",72,,

These are international issues . and the problems in our society do disproportionately affect women and children . Wesy that through the common suffering across Nal across national borders . This relates to what we were saying earlier about the missing and murdered indigenous women, the violence faced by women in so many communities, all of this is Interlinked . that's why the protest movement in Iran is inspiring people across the world.",73,,

86,0.97,2235.733,2794.658,"Thank you so much . So items on the full council agenda tomorrow include two appointments to the Pacific hospital and public development authority . The Council agenda also includes a bill 42020 which updates the criminal code to Harminize with state legislative changes . and Councilmember bill 120424 which allows municipal parks to accept the grant funds, one time for therapy for court coordinator and community, counselor, funded through a with one time grant through the that the municipal court intends to use . those are the items coming up from the public safety committee . and no public safety committee meetings until December . I want to offer a few departmental related notes . in the area of safety, I do want to thank Councilmember Pedersen for his statement this weekend amplifying instances of gun violence . I support his call for public safety intervention in that specific area as well as throughout the city . very encouraged that Multidisciplinary approaches using both traditional law enforcement and Deversion programs are beginning to pay off in areas . We are hearing from residents downtown that they see a difference and they feel we are starting to turn a corner . But we know we need models in other areas and everyone who has a stake in community safety . as a reminder, not necessary for the members of the public safety and human services committee but other Councilmembers, we here think the summer about intervention and prevention efforts, two separate meetings back to back, one was really led by King County public health . The second one we brought in the providers who are doing the work including the leadership intervention and change, community Massageways, we heard from the medical center, hospital based prevention staff . We also heard from the regional domestic violence Firearm reinforcement unit and we were joined Tina Driso at the Mayor's office leading Conviolence prevention efforts . We know that this is an important element in the Mayor's proposed budget . The Mayor's budget includes $4.3 million for the Seattle community safety Commission . Te Commission . These are geographically focused interventions . It also includes 1.5 million for youth and families impacted by gun violence at King County's hospital at harbor view medical center . in July at this committee meeting, we learned that the program has traditionally focused on young people . We have seen good outcomes from the work the program has done, providing wrap around services for victims of gun violence, their families and the families of suspected Perpetrators of gun violence and the reason why this is so important is because victims of gun violence often become Perpetrators of gun violence . So this intervention has positive outcomes . What we are seeing is we really need to expand the age range to serve ages 25 to 40 where we are seeing an increasing amount of violence . I could identify when we share our priorities, Councilmembers individually, with the Mayor's office prior to being an announcement, I did identify this expansion as a priority of mine in the Mayor's budget . If we find out through our efforts, delving through the Mayor's budget that it is not included, expansion to the older Cohort, I will be seeking such an expansion in the 2023 budget . other items related to public safety, just want to share that there are two Council appointed vacancies . My office will be sending out an advisory soon seeking Members.I members . I encourage Councilmembers to circulate the advisory and let us know of any interested persons . Just basic requirements, commissioners are expected to attend twice monthly meetings, currently scheduled for the first and third Wednesdays of every month between 9:00 a.m. and noon . Cos noon . commissioners must be able to dedicate at least 10 hours per month to the work which includes participating in committees or ad hoc work group, attending community meetings and forum and engaging the community . the public safety civil service committee will also have a Council appointed at the end of 2022 and I will be working on circulating information on the appointment later in the Fall.N fall . on the human services Department side of things, as mentioned, it is domestic violence awareness month . The women's Commission is hosting a community impeachment event . We are here in city hall between noon Sdw 40. the theme is shattering stigma through knowledge . hoping to shatter the stigma of assault and make resources more available to victims and survivors of domestic violence . On regional committees last week, there was a ferry terminal update project . The Washington fairies will be replacing the dock at Font LeRoy neighborhoods . I Suved on the elected advisory group . The Fontleroy is one of a few in a residential area . Ty area . They have been in the phases of review before proceeding with environmental review . We received a significant update at a meeting of the community advisory group recently . They eliminated from consideration a proposal that would have expanded the dock to the North into the Cove area . E area . There are two remaining, one expanding the terminal outward and the other is to maintain the current size, possibly in combination of the system that we already use on highways with tolls . So there Woul be advanced Ticketing . Lat Ticketing . last week I did have office hours on Friday at the Southwest community center . and then I was in community a lot last week with Passageways, Evergreen treatment services, fundraising events on Thursday and also on Thursday, the Sciu775 leadership board celebration on Friday morning, attended and had the honor to speak at the annual firefighter Memorial recognition event .

We need many more housing options, Plerly for people experiencing homelessness . and the proposed project Siting has created a lot of fear and extreme frustration for many folks in the C.I.D . due to the initial lack of communication and transparency and candidly the historic conditions in the neighborhood . So you know, I was at the community meeting in 2017 before I was elected when the city told community members that they were putting the Navn center in little Saigon . people were very frustrated about that . I acknowledge what they are asking and what they asked for which is that we don't allow another planning process to go forward without them that could perpetuate structural racism and add to the burdens of the harm already done and that they act in accordance with the Council's goals and values and sort of take a step back and make sure we are being inclusive in this process and really listening to folks in the community .

I don't want to get on my gender politics soap box but I can't help but believe if it was an Nba Player in Russia in a prison cell, that people would not be doing more . So I hope we don't forget about that . I'm guessing from the media and the news we get that there are behind the scenes negotiations going on .
