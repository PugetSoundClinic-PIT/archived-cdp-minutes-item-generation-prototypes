119,0.97,646.245,655.955,I would like to address the need to extend hazard pay and point out there's no indication of what Council is authorizing to be paid and built this week.,28,,
120,0.97,655.955,687.153,"Now, our democracy provides a legislative pen that's supposed to protect the workers, the people, and discipline the greed and keep the capital gains from abusing local community that's going to Wall Street middlemen, foreign and domestic, that are draining the life blood of Americans, proving capitalism is abusive when it's free to rip off the workers while securing record profits for Nonworking middlemen shareholders of Wall Street buying off our tainted Republic and fraudulent democracy.",28,,
121,0.97,687.153,693.926,"The workers need a three and a half day workweek, seven-day pay, with a doubling of the jobs to boost morale.",28,,
122,0.97,693.926,709.075,"With all the money redirected and taken from the most corrupt entity within capitalism, namely, the middlemen of capital gains ripping off and stealing from this Nation every three-month quarterly report.",28,,
123,0.97,709.075,711.31,Take a look at Kroger profits.,28,,
124,0.97,711.31,719.685,"They soared as big business proves they hate the workers, tossing their rights and respect in the trash, because there's plenty more desperate to take advantage of.",28,,
125,0.97,719.685,726.158,City Council has to improve their use of the democracy pen to protect the workers doing all the work.,28,,
126,0.97,726.158,746.078,"And Secondly, if you don't mind, there is a problem at Pier 62 with the parks and recreation Department security guards hanging out with their friends on the pier with a toxic engine running, ruining the only place a local resident has access to.",28,,
127,0.97,746.078,767.967,"At 10:00 p.m., the same unprofessional parks and recreation Pier 62 security guards evidently getting paid 24/7 to hang on the pier treat locals, like myself, like criminals if they go on the pier after 10:00 P.M.",28,,
128,0.97,767.967,772.872,"Security refusing to keep safe, allow improper use all night.",28,,
129,0.97,772.872,783.582,"Our next Speaker is Julia Buck, followed by Brent Hayes.",29,,
130,0.97,783.582,785.851,Hello.,30,,
131,0.97,785.851,795.394,"My name is Julia Buck, I'm a resident of district six and a member of 3650 Seattle and Seattle Dsa.",30,,
132,0.97,795.394,806.705,I am calling to ask city council not to repeal the hazard pay for essential workers and grocery workers.,30,,
133,0.97,806.705,818.984,Just yesterday the city council extended the Telework policy for the Department and the Stipend for eligible employees because of the pandemic.,30,,
134,0.97,818.984,828.194,"This was--this is a reasonable move, as our Covid cases are higher now than they have been at any point during the pandemic.",30,,
135,0.97,828.194,851.784,"However, it makes little sense for the Council to extend these protections to themselves and other legislators and then deny them to grocery workers who are forced to work in person by the nature of their positions and who have borne the brunt of feeding people for this entire pandemic.",30,,
136,0.97,851.784,859.058,I would urge city Council to please keep hazard pay in place.,30,,
137,0.97,859.058,861.293,Thank you very much.,30,,
138,0.97,861.293,867.166,"Our next Speaker is Brent Hayes, followed by Star Willie.",31,,
139,0.97,867.166,874.006,"Hello, my name is Brent Hayes, and I am a Barista working at the 1200 West Lake Avenue Starbucks location.",32,,
140,0.97,874.006,881.347,"Partnership is a word that I feel is frequently thrown around at Starbucks, and to me a word like that should hold more weight than it does.",32,,
141,0.97,881.347,882.915,It means that we have a voice.,32,,
142,0.97,882.915,887.319,It means we have a seat at the table and a chance to influence the change being made in our stores.,32,,
143,0.97,887.319,891.957,This is why I'm calling today.,32,,
144,0.97,891.957,910.843,"It is to discuss Kshama Sawant's resolution and show solidarity with the working class, because we have been blind sided by changes in pandemic benefits, removal of health and safety protocols, and we have been crammed into spaces with not enough space or resources to enable us to remain safe during this pandemic.",32,,
145,0.97,910.843,922.054,"It is in the best interest of our marginalized communities, our most vulnerable communities, to stand together as true partners.",32,,
146,0.97,922.054,927.559,We also would like to discuss the $4 hazard pay and the removal of such.,32,,
147,0.97,927.559,948.414,"As a worker in the service industry, it is basically insulting the notion that during a time where we need to work in order to keep a roof over our heads yet are at risk, and our families are at risk due to Covid, we are unable to actually do so.",32,,
148,0.97,948.414,953.152,Cuts in hours because businesses cannot be open for as long.,32,,
149,0.97,953.152,958.457,Cuts in hours because Ceos are taking losses because of the pandemic and do not want to pay us.,32,,
150,0.97,958.457,959.725,All of this is unfair.,32,,
151,0.97,959.725,962.061,And that $4 hazard pay really was a buffer.,32,,
152,0.97,962.061,968.2,I'm calling upon the city Council to support Starbucks workers United in our efforts to Unionize our stores.,32,,
153,0.97,968.2,986.652,"And I'm calling upon the city Council to reinstate the $4 hazard pay and apply it to the frontline workers who have been the backbone of Seattle, tirelessly risking their lives so that people who are more wealthy can enjoy their dinner, their coffee, or a movie.",32,,
154,0.97,986.652,987.72,Thank you.,32,,
155,0.97,987.72,994.46,"Our next caller is Star Willie, followed by B.J.",33,,

159,0.97,1000.132,1016.648,I'm calling today to echo the other Starbucks workers that have called in and voice that I strongly support Councilmember Sawant's resolution demanding that Starbucks bosses immediately stop their shameful investing and accept card check neutrality.,34,,
160,0.97,1016.648,1023.789,"I don't have illusion that is the executives will do this because it's the right thing to do, and we really could use the support of city council for the fight ahead.",34,,
161,0.97,1023.789,1027.626,We as workers need to fight to force them to concede.,34,,
162,0.97,1027.626,1035.3,Thank you very much Councilmember Sawant for putting forth this resolution and always standing with workers in true solidarity with your actions.,34,,
163,0.97,1035.3,1043.642,My message to the eight Democrats on the city council is that I hear you saying an that you support workers and you support unions.,34,,
164,0.97,1043.642,1047.379,But what we want and what we need is not words but actions.,34,,
165,0.97,1047.379,1059.625,"So I'll say it loud and clear, if you don't vote yes on this resolution, if you vote no or try to water it down, then no, you are not Pro-Worker nor Pro-Union.",34,,
166,0.97,1059.625,1062.428,You are Pro-Exploitations of workers by the wealthy.,34,,
167,0.97,1062.428,1063.128,It's that simple.,34,,
168,0.97,1063.128,1066.198,Stand with Starbucks workers now by adopting this resolution.,34,,
169,0.97,1066.198,1073.872,And I would like to echo the other callers in voicing my strong support to extend and not end the hazard pay to grocery workers.,34,,

184,0.97,1127.426,1138.237,This is why this meeting is being held remotely and why city council extended the Telework Stipend yesterday.,36,,
185,0.97,1138.237,1143.542,Council should not end hazard pay for grocery workers while it is working remotely.,36,,
186,0.97,1143.542,1153.418,"Hazard pay for grocery workers should remain in effect until the Council or Mayor TERMINATES the Covid civil emergency, in effect since March 2020.",36,,
187,0.97,1153.418,1159.124,Grocery workers did not start receiving hazard pay until almost a year after the proclamation of the civil emergency.,36,,
188,0.97,1159.124,1163.295,They should not lose hazard pay before the civil emergency is over.,36,,

192,0.97,1188.453,1192.724,It's engaging in an obvious Anti-Union campaign.,38,,
193,0.97,1192.724,1199.031,Starbucks insists they are not Anti-Union and dresses up their tactics by being Pro-Partner.,38,,
194,0.97,1199.031,1204.202,Does Starbucks think it's employees are stupid?,38,,
195,0.97,1204.202,1212.077,Frankly it is an Instoult my intelligence and my Coworker's intelligence.,38,,
196,0.97,1212.077,1213.011,It's embarrassing to watch.,38,,

202,0.97,1266.398,1268.133,I know what the Union Busting looks like.,40,,
203,0.97,1268.133,1277.909,"I was at the heart of it for months, and I know that Starbucks cannot be held accountable in not bringing that to Seattle.",40,,
204,0.97,1277.909,1281.279,To bringing that to their hometown.,40,,
205,0.97,1281.279,1284.349,We need to demand that they stop.,40,,
206,0.97,1284.349,1294.66,"They will host captive audience meetings, they will threaten their partners, they will push us and manipulate us, psychologically and through the benefit that is they give us now.",40,,

211,0.97,1322.854,1324.389,These are human beings.,40,,
212,0.97,1324.389,1329.061,These are people that do work that we consider essential months ago.,40,,
213,0.97,1329.061,1331.73,And now we want to take this away from them.,40,,
214,0.97,1331.73,1334.933,We want to take away the security that's been provided.,40,,
215,0.97,1334.933,1335.334,It's unacceptable.,40,,
216,0.97,1335.334,1349.748,"And if you vote against this and the resolution that Councilmember Sawant has brought in any way, shape, and form, if you so much as try to dilute it, you are against it.",40,,

222,0.97,1363.495,1369.768,"I am a union Barista, I'm a frontline worker through the pandemic.",43,,
223,0.97,1369.768,1386.585,"While these corporations, including Starbucks, have made record profits, passing on all the risks of that work on to these workers, on to my Union Siblings and my fellow Baristas who were trying to form unions, passing on all the risking to us, but none of the fruits of our labor.",43,,
224,0.97,1386.585,1391.423,I agree with what's been said about the city council getting to Telework while we have to work in person.,43,,
225,0.97,1391.423,1400.065,That brings me to agreeing with the need to keep hazard pay for grocery store workers.,43,,
226,0.97,1400.065,1412.043,"I heard from a trader Joe's worker how that $4 cushion is protection against having to go into work sick, knowingly putting people at risk, because there's no other safety net that.",43,,
227,0.97,1412.043,1417.682,$4 cushion is in place of all the other safety nets at work we should have.,43,,
228,0.97,1417.682,1427.325,"So please keep hazard pay for grocery workers, and grocery workers need a Union, and so does Starbucks workers and Baristas.",43,,
229,0.97,1427.325,1435.2,Starbucks has consistently put profits over their work partners throughout the pandemic.,43,,
230,0.97,1435.2,1440.772,Rent has gone up 25% in the last year in this city while inflation has gone up 5%.,43,,
231,0.97,1440.772,1445.811,Baristas are taking pay cuts and not being able to keep pace.,43,,
232,0.97,1445.811,1452.083,So I'm urging the city Council to vote yes on Kshama Sawant's resolution in solidarity with Starbucks workers trying to form a Union.,43,,
233,0.97,1452.083,1458.557,"And to the city Council, you're not progressive if you're not Pro-Union, if you're not clearly on the side of workers.",43,,
234,0.97,1458.557,1462.394,This is an opportunity to show what side you're on.,43,,
235,0.97,1462.394,1470.702,"Please vote yes on this resolution, stand in solidarity with the workers and denounce Starbucks' corporate Union Busting.",43,,

240,0.97,1516.248,1527.826,"They have managers, imagine the person that's responsible for giving you your paycheck coming and pulling you off the floor personally and telling you they would be heartbroken, heartbroken, if you voted yes to the June Yop.",45,,
241,0.97,1527.826,1538.703,"They have done everything from close store that is are filing for Union elections, and they have turned them into a training center in order to try to train as many people as possible in order to dilute the Union vote.",45,,
242,0.97,1538.703,1541.806,Seattle is the home of Starbucks.,45,,

246,0.97,1557.722,1561.593,It's simply unacceptable what they've been doing.,45,,
247,0.97,1561.593,1565.864,They've essentially been waging psychological warfare on us to try to get us to vote no to the Union.,45,,
248,0.97,1565.864,1572.704,"And they've said time and time again that they're not Anti-Union, and it's not true.",45,,
249,0.97,1572.704,1591.69,"The union Busting tactics that they've done in Buffalo and now across the country, it has to stop in Seattle, and you all have the power to stop it from happening, as being the home of Starbucks, this is in your hometown, and you have the ability to take a stand and hold them accountable and be the company that we all know that they can be.",45,,

332,0.97,2064.462,2066.731,The vote was 8-0.,75,,
333,0.97,2066.731,2071.269,"Everyone voted yes, and I did not vote because I was not here.",75,,
334,0.97,2071.269,2075.773,"So anyway, on February 3RD, hazard pay for the grocery ordinance went into effect.",75,,
335,0.97,2075.773,2087.485,"And then from there we started with Council bill 120119, which is what's before us today, and those are the amendments to the hazard pay for the Dwroesry employees.",75,,
336,0.97,2087.485,2093.791,That is this would be the bill to end hazard pay requirements upon the effective date of the ordinance.,75,,
337,0.97,2093.791,2096.494,"And again, that's what's before us today.",75,,
338,0.97,2096.494,2108.239,"On July 9, 2021, out of Councilmember Mosqueda's committee, Finance and housing, the bill was voted out of committee, 4-0.",75,,
339,0.97,2108.239,2120.184,"In favor were chair Mosqueda, Councilmember President Gonzalez, Councilmember Lewis, and I believe Councilmember Herbold Abstained.",75,,
340,0.97,2120.184,2125.656,"Then on July 27th, August 9th, September 13th, this Council held the bill on those three dates.",75,,
341,0.97,2125.656,2134.632,"On July 27th, council voted to hold passage of the bill 7-0, not present was Councilmember Morales and Mosqueda.",75,,
342,0.97,2134.632,2138.603,"On August 9th, this Council again voted to hold passage of the bill.",75,,
343,0.97,2138.603,2139.27,It was 8-0.,75,,
344,0.97,2139.27,2144.275,The only person not present that day was Council President Gonzalez.,75,,
345,0.97,2144.275,2152.817,"Then on September 13th, council voted again to hold passage of the bill.",75,,
346,0.97,2152.817,2154.051,It was a 9-0 vote.,75,,
347,0.97,2154.051,2157.255,So everybody voted yes on September 13th to hold passage of this particular bill.,75,,
348,0.97,2157.255,2170.568,"This bill then went to the full council again on Monday, December 13, 2021, and the vote was 8-0 to end hazard pay.",75,,
349,0.97,2170.568,2172.77,Everyone was present except for Councilmember Sawant.,75,,
350,0.97,2172.77,2178.075,So that's why the vote was 8-0.,75,,
351,0.97,2178.075,2186.184,"So on December 27, 2021, Mayor Durkan got this piece of legislation, and she vetoed it and returned the bill back to Council.",75,,
352,0.97,2186.184,2196.027,"So here we are today, exactly one year to the day, January 25, 2022, so Council will have an opportunity to reconsider passage of the bill.",75,,
353,0.97,2196.027,2207.371,"So I'm going to, at this time, turn it over to any of my colleague that is may have some comments to say, and then I'm going to give some instruction about how we're going to vote on this.",75,,
354,0.97,2207.371,2213.544,"So with that, I'm going to open up the floor.",75,,
355,0.97,2213.544,2213.844,Colleagues?,75,,
356,0.97,2213.844,2218.883,"Councilmember Herbold, I see your hand is up.",75,,
357,0.97,2218.883,2221.319,Thank you so much.,76,,
358,0.97,2221.319,2244.408,"Appreciate, Madame President, your sharing of the history of the Council's decision to not act on the suspension of hazard pay on several occasions over the last several months.",76,,
359,0.97,2244.408,2261.192,And appreciate that that--the actions the Council has taken in the past to not vote on this legislation reflected the uncertainty that many Councilmembers had around the timing.,76,,
360,0.97,2261.192,2279.844,"When I did vote on the hazard pay--the ending of the hazard pay, the legislation, I did say publicly at that time that I recognize that we may need to Revisit it because of the uncertainty.",76,,
361,0.97,2279.844,2289.754,And this vote was more than--just a little bit more than a week before the Omicron surge.,76,,
362,0.97,2289.754,2291.322,Of Omicron surge hadn't happened yet.,76,,
363,0.97,2291.322,2315.246,Many of us said when we voted on the termination of hazard pay that we may need to Revisit it and that we recognize that public health is the number one priority as we continue to get updated advice from public health officials that we must react quickly to protect the health and safety of our constituents.,76,,
364,0.97,2315.246,2340.938,"I issued a statement after the Mayor's veto of Council's bill saying that I supported it, and I'm glad to be here today to affirm my support of continued hazard pay for these frontline workers at essential businesses.",76,,
365,0.97,2340.938,2341.639,Thank you.,76,,
366,0.97,2341.639,2342.773,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",77,,
367,0.97,2342.773,2345.576,Is there anyone else who would like to comment?,77,,
368,0.97,2345.576,2346.777,"Councilmember Nelson, go ahead.",77,,
369,0.97,2346.777,2348.479,"Thank you very much, president Juarez.",78,,
370,0.97,2348.479,2366.297,"I'm going to vote in favor of the proposed substitute because I think you did the right thing in December in Sunsetting the increase, which we passed as emergency legislation before the vaccine was widely available.",78,,
371,0.97,2366.297,2378.609,"And now 87.5% of residents over 16 are Vaccinated, and 5 years and up, 83% are Vaccinated.",78,,
372,0.97,2378.609,2399.964,"So you know, Mayor Durkan vetoed Council bill 120119 which revealed hazard pay shortly after--maybe just days after Omicron came on the scene and before we knew about its Transmisability or its veer lens.",78,,
373,0.97,2399.964,2411.342,"It's estimated it'll peak in February, and locally the Seattle/King County public health dashboard shows today that the number of new cases in Seattle is down 49% from last week.",78,,
374,0.97,2411.342,2418.349,So the point is that conditions have changed.,78,,
375,0.97,2418.349,2421.418,And since your original legislation.,78,,
376,0.97,2421.418,2426.223,Washington ended its official--I mean its--it Re-Opened officially in June.,78,,
377,0.97,2426.223,2429.794,Schools are back open for gin person learning.,78,,
378,0.97,2429.794,2440.671,"Just today Uw announced it would go back to in person, and our own libraries are Re-Opened, and our librarians aren't getting hazard pay.",78,,
379,0.97,2440.671,2441.839,So here's why this matters.,78,,
380,0.97,2441.839,2452.85,"I have spoken with PCC and the independent grocers, and they're really struggling with this significant increase.",78,,
381,0.97,2452.85,2459.79,"I'm concerned about their viability, because if they close, those jobs go away and the neighborhood loses that asset.",78,,
382,0.97,2459.79,2465.963,"And you know, there was one example of the grocery outlet in district two that did close.",78,,
383,0.97,2465.963,2468.032,So that is why I'm concerned.,78,,
384,0.97,2468.032,2480.511,"And we're not talking about Kroger here, we're talking about largely family-owned, many of them family owned, and if they don't raise their--if they don't close, they might have to raise their prices.",78,,
385,0.97,2480.511,2488.652,And we already know what's happening with prices with all the supply chain problems.,78,,
386,0.97,2488.652,2490.454,"They're already going up, and work families are hurting.",78,,
387,0.97,2490.454,2495.492,So that is the crux of the matter for me.,78,,
388,0.97,2495.492,2507.338,"If we vote no on this legislation, in other words, scene the Mayor's veto, this hazard pay increase will be in place indefinitely, or until the Mayor calls an end to the civil emergency.",78,,
389,0.97,2507.338,2514.645,And right now most of the other jurisdictions have already sunset or repealed their hazard pay.,78,,
390,0.97,2514.645,2521.819,"I think maybe Burien and Edmonds are two exceptions, but the vast majority, pretty much all of them, have ended this.",78,,
391,0.97,2521.819,2533.998,"And United food workers of America, local 21 did signal it's--negotiating other contracts.",78,,
392,0.97,2533.998,2542.573,So that work is ongoing right now and it was said in Committee in December that this legislation was not intended to be a permanent wage replacement.,78,,
393,0.97,2542.573,2548.279,And so let's let wages be dealt with in contract negotiations.,78,,
394,0.97,2548.279,2556.687,"So if we pass this proposed substitute, the $4 an hour wage will be in effect for another month, for 30 days.",78,,
395,0.97,2556.687,2567.331,"We're likely to see--have more information about Omicron at that point, and I believe that, you know, this city's going to keep changing all the time.",78,,
396,0.97,2567.331,2568.399,Now there's a new Omicron variant.,78,,
397,0.97,2568.399,2592.99,"But the point is we have to follow the recommendations of public health officials, and that is--and the Mayor's letter in vetoing this said that, I'll quote it, in the new year, the incoming administration and city council will have the benefit of much more information regarding Omicron and its impacts, and can work with organized labor, other workers, and impacted businesses to evaluate the appropriate next steps.",78,,
398,0.97,2592.99,2602.833,"And I think we're at that time for appropriate next steps, and that is why I am going to vote in favor of this legislation.",78,,
399,0.97,2602.833,2609.807,"Thank you, Councilmember Nelson.",79,,
400,0.97,2609.807,2610.274,Is there anyone else?,79,,
401,0.97,2610.274,2610.774,Councilmember Pedersen?,79,,
402,0.97,2610.774,2615.646,"Thank you, Council President Juarez.",80,,
403,0.97,2615.646,2627.925,"Colleagues, as you know, I voted for the original bill in January of 2021 to support Seattle grocery workers and require their employers to provide hazard pay.",80,,
404,0.97,2627.925,2635.632,"I also supported efforts to keep it in place for a full year, due in part to the earlier Delta variant of the Coronavirus.",80,,
405,0.97,2635.632,2641.705,"I have been, however, torn about whether to continue to require those payments into 2022.",80,,
406,0.97,2641.705,2648.278,"Just a few weeks ago on December 13th, eight of us voted to sunset this hazard pay.",80,,
407,0.97,2648.278,2657.588,"I know several of my colleagues, including Councilmember Herbold, are making good points about why to support and uphold Mayor Durkan's decision a month ago.",80,,
408,0.97,2657.588,2670.868,"Ultimately, however, I've decided to be consistent with my December 2021 vote, and so I'll be voting to override the veto of our former Mayor, so the hazard pay requirements could sunset in 30 days.",80,,
409,0.97,2670.868,2681.578,I want to acknowledge that frontline workers in numerous industry that is bravely serve Seattle every day should not only be paid well but also be able to work the quantity of hours they need.,80,,
410,0.97,2681.578,2692.489,And a key question for me is when is it a city government's role to intervene and require business owners to pay above their current compensation.,80,,
411,0.97,2692.489,2707.938,"The pandemic has spurred the creation and expansion of many relief programs funded by several different sources, and I've supported nearly all of these interventions because a pandemic is an extraordinary crisis Warranting extraordinary responses.",80,,
412,0.97,2707.938,2724.254,"In my original vote in January 2021, a year ago, to support grocery workers, it received criticism from several of my constituents when the Cincinnati-Based Kroger company announced the closing of a cherished Qfc grocery store in the Wedgewood neighborhood.",80,,
413,0.97,2724.254,2733.597,"But I stand by my original vote a year ago, but I need to explain why I think we should override the Mayor's last-minute veto of our sunset legislation.",80,,
414,0.97,2733.597,2739.136,"Again, Seattle has imposed this special hazard pay for a year.",80,,
415,0.97,2739.136,2745.175,The supplemental pay would not end immediately but rather after 30 days.,80,,
416,0.97,2745.175,2748.345,Dr. Fauci recently announced that things look like they're going in the right direction.,80,,
417,0.97,2748.345,2756.687,Today the University of Washington and Seattle University announced they will be returning to In-Person classes next week.,80,,
418,0.97,2756.687,2766.463,"Beyond the Government-Imposed minimum wage, I believe workers and their employers should negotiate compensation and benefits without a local government dictating what they must be.",80,,
419,0.97,2766.463,2784.381,"The local Union, United Food and Commercial workers, UFCW local 21, is very effective throughout Washington State and beyond in advocating for the grocery workers they represent and organizing those who may want to form a Union and in influencing policymakers.",80,,
420,0.97,2784.381,2791.922,Temporary hazard pay for grocery workers already ended months ago in all 35 California jurisdictions that originally required it.,80,,
421,0.97,2791.922,2797.628,And it has also ended in about half of the Washington state jurisdictions that required it.,80,,
422,0.97,2797.628,2809.139,Ending the hazard pay in Seattle could make it more financially feasible for other stores to move into the Wedgewood location and open stores throughout Seattle or to remain in business.,80,,
423,0.97,2809.139,2824.721,"As we strive to emerge from the Covid pandemic, I believe it may be time to transition away from some of the emergency measures we have put in place over the past two years, unless such measures are required by public health authorities or funded by the Federal Government.",80,,
424,0.97,2824.721,2829.626,And so I'll be voting to override the Mayor's veto today.,80,,
425,0.97,2829.626,2830.16,Thank you.,80,,
426,0.97,2830.16,2831.461,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",81,,
427,0.97,2831.461,2839.102,"I see that Councilmember Sawant, you have your hand up.",81,,
428,0.97,2839.102,2839.336,Please.,81,,
429,0.97,2839.336,2839.803,Councilmember Sawant?,81,,
430,0.97,2839.803,2854.851,"I am, of course, opposing the legislation originally sponsored by Self-Described--Mosqueda that would end the $4 hazard pay that grocery workers depend on during this emergency.",82,,
431,0.97,2854.851,2863.193,"In other words, I am voting to uphold the veto from the outgoing Mayor.",82,,
432,0.97,2863.193,2870.1,"We know that over 330 community members have Emailed the Council, saying the Council cannot dare to repeal the hazard pay.",82,,
433,0.97,2870.1,2879.71,"We've seen a petition to the Council from trader Joe's workers, over 40 trader Joe's workers have signed this petition urging the Council to maintain the hazard pay.",82,,
434,0.97,2879.71,2889.786,"In December, this bill came to the Council for a vote on a day that I was out sick, and Scandalously, all of the other eight Councilmembers were present.",82,,
435,0.97,2889.786,2893.523,All Democrats voted to end the hazard pay for grocery workers.,82,,
436,0.97,2893.523,2908.105,"This is totally unacceptable, as I had explained in Council meetings throughout last summer when this bill ending hazard pay almost came to a vote several times, but the vote was, quote, Unquote, held, which means delayed at the time.",82,,
437,0.97,2908.105,2915.545,Grocery workers have risked their lives on poverty wages to make food available to all of society throughout this dry Sis.,82,,
438,0.97,2915.545,2924.922,I have repeatedly argued that the hazard pay should not only be maintained for grocery workers but should be extended to all frontline workers for as long as this public health emergency lasts.,82,,
439,0.97,2924.922,2938.135,"To get a sense of how Anti-Worker the Democrats ending of the grocery worker hazard pay was, consider this study in Washington, California, and Colorado.",82,,
440,0.97,2938.135,2947.911,"This survey shows that while Kroger Ceo made $22 million last year, most of the company's frontline workers faced homelessness, Eviction, or hunger.",82,,
441,0.97,2947.911,2967.164,"The study surveyed a staggering So,000 workers, and found that more than three quart Ires are food insecure, 14% faced homelessness in the past year, and real wages have decreased.",82,,
442,0.97,2967.164,2970.033,The hazard pay should last as long as the health emergency lasted.,82,,
443,0.97,2970.033,2977.24,"As long as there is an emergency, hazard pay is the least that grocery workers should be getting.",82,,
444,0.97,2977.24,2983.213,Former Mayor Durkan vetoed the end of hazard pay which was the right thing to do.,82,,
445,0.97,2983.213,2993.59,"She was a carpet politician, but she had no choice but to veto, because the bill hit her desk when Omicron started sweeping the city.",82,,
446,0.97,2993.59,3001.698,"Councilmembers, and as you've heard today, have attempted to excuse their Anti-Worker vote in December by saying they could not have predicted Omg Chron.",82,,
447,0.97,3001.698,3006.403,"While it is true that Omicron could not have been precisely predicted, that is not the question at all.",82,,
448,0.97,3006.403,3023.754,"The question is why were Councilmembers, many of these Self-Described progressive Councilmembers, so eager to end the hazard pay for grocery workers, so eager they could not wait for the official end of the situation in our city.",82,,
449,0.97,3023.754,3026.723,Kroger executives get to be safe and work from home.,82,,
450,0.97,3026.723,3028.759,None of these excuses are acceptable.,82,,
451,0.97,3028.759,3041.972,And Councilmembers Nelson and Pedersen not only say that they believe that voting to end hazard pay in December was the right thing to do but also say that they're voting to end hazard pay now in the middle of the deadly Omicron surge.,82,,
452,0.97,3041.972,3043.006,This is just stunning.,82,,
453,0.97,3043.006,3047.811,"My allegiance is to the grocery workers, not to the bosses at Kroger.",82,,
454,0.97,3047.811,3053.083,"As I said, I'll be voting to make hazard pay.",82,,
455,0.97,3053.083,3059.823,I urge Councilmembers to reverse the Scandalous position you took in December and vote to reverse hazard pay.,82,,
456,0.97,3059.823,3069.299,I want to urge all worker people in Seattle to support grocery workers as they fight this year for a decent contract.,82,,
457,0.97,3069.299,3076.406,I understand with Starbucks workers fighting to Unionize and to push for rank and file driven Democratly organized unions.,82,,
458,0.97,3076.406,3083.914,"I also want to be, you know, I want to say that last year across the country inflation far outpaced wages.",82,,
459,0.97,3083.914,3087.451,"In other words, the average family took a real pay cut.",82,,
460,0.97,3087.451,3097.461,"A pay cut in real terms last year because even though wages may have gone up in nominal terms, inflation has outpaced it.",82,,
461,0.97,3097.461,3105.836,Councilmember Nelson's assertion that price increases are somehow caused by the tiny wage increases by the lowest wage workers unfounded.,82,,
462,0.97,3105.836,3113.11,This has no basis in statistical evidence.,82,,
463,0.97,3113.11,3113.81,Wages are falling behind prices.,82,,
464,0.97,3113.81,3122.185,"Grocery workers need hazard pay and a substantial raise, safe working conditions, and decent hours.",82,,
465,0.97,3122.185,3138.235,I stand in solidarity with grocery workers in their fight to protect hazard pay and with all grocery workers whether they're unionized or not who are fighting for this hazard pay and for all Nonunionized grocery workers to get unionized and fight for a good contract.,82,,
466,0.97,3138.235,3138.702,Thank you.,82,,
467,0.97,3138.702,3144.107,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",83,,
468,0.97,3144.107,3150.213,Is there anything else anyone would like to say before I say a few closing comments?,83,,
469,0.97,3150.213,3150.514,Thank you.,83,,
470,0.97,3150.514,3163.426,"Councilmember Sawant, thank you for your comments, but I just want to add that members are reminded it is never in order to attack the integrity of your colleagues for why they are voting the way they are voting.",83,,
471,0.97,3163.426,3173.069,It's--every member should be reminded that it's never an order to make personal comments or undermine what party any of us belong to.,83,,
